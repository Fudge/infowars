[00:00.000 --> 00:12.200]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.200 --> 00:38.120]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:38.120 --> 00:44.600]  it's Monday the 29th day of July 2013 I'm your host Alex Jones we're going to be
[00:44.600 --> 00:49.320]  live here for the next three hours and we're going to have open phones and be
[00:49.320 --> 00:55.120]  taking your phone calls and trying to go over all of the just off the chart
[00:55.120 --> 01:01.400]  bombshell news and information you know the average person has trouble
[01:01.400 --> 01:07.440]  imagining eighty five million dollars of taxpayer money being stolen each month
[01:07.440 --> 01:12.920]  in QE three or QE infinity and given to foreign banks thousands of private
[01:12.920 --> 01:19.680]  corporations media outlets and then the details are kept from Congress when
[01:19.680 --> 01:23.840]  Congress controls the power of the purse under the US Constitution people have
[01:23.840 --> 01:30.560]  trouble wrapping their mind around it was 27 trillion in one form of bailout or
[01:30.560 --> 01:37.000]  another that mainly multinational offshore banks got from 2008 till about
[01:37.000 --> 01:46.200]  2011 we haven't gotten numbers in two years now they just don't release those
[01:46.200 --> 01:52.920]  and people have trouble getting their mind around that 27 trillion 28 trillion
[01:52.920 --> 02:01.320]  but they can get their mind around Obama going to Europe going to Ireland going
[02:01.320 --> 02:06.720]  to South Africa going to universities around the United States and saying hey
[02:06.720 --> 02:10.400]  you shouldn't be able to have air conditioning or a car or live well that
[02:10.400 --> 02:15.360]  hurts the earth you need to basically pay more taxes you're bad trying to live
[02:15.360 --> 02:21.840]  well see they say anything they want to tax is bad so they're gonna tax it but
[02:21.840 --> 02:25.560]  ignore all the real environmental problems and people can really wrap
[02:25.560 --> 02:30.040]  their minds around that they can really wrap their minds around power prices
[02:30.040 --> 02:32.720]  going up and people now are learning it's because they're shutting power
[02:32.720 --> 02:37.640]  plants down by the hundreds every year I mean this country's having the lights
[02:37.640 --> 02:43.360]  turned off like the hell 9000 in 2001 Space Odyssey where they're there
[02:43.360 --> 02:49.600]  turning off the computers data banks I'm afraid Dave I'm afraid if America was
[02:49.600 --> 02:54.040]  a hell 9000 if I was a hell 9000 I'm sitting there watching our power
[02:54.040 --> 02:59.680]  industry our liberties our freedoms our health everything butchered everything
[02:59.680 --> 03:05.120]  it took hundreds of years to build is being annihilated and then Obama is on
[03:05.120 --> 03:13.240]  another trip 75 staffers to join president on Ritzie Island Obama
[03:13.240 --> 03:20.880]  vineyard vacation 7.6 million private resort over 75 rooms booked for staff
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.080]  and it's gonna cost millions and millions of dollars and he and and you
[03:25.080 --> 03:31.240]  thought you thought that Bush was bad vacationing two months a year
[03:31.240 --> 03:35.280]  and Clinton this guy's up to like three months a year because he knows he's just
[03:35.280 --> 03:40.080]  a front man so all debate Obama all day but in a way you've got to debate him
[03:40.080 --> 03:43.600]  because he is the agenda he's the reason they can do it it's like well he
[03:43.600 --> 03:47.880]  drops bombs on people and funds al-Qaeda and secretly arrest Americans and has
[03:47.880 --> 03:52.720]  the CIA engaged in domestic propaganda because he's he's black I'm supposed to
[03:52.720 --> 03:57.480]  just go oh my gosh is suppose that daddy is from Kenya we know who his real dad
[03:57.480 --> 04:03.680]  is and I don't think the guy's even black the point doesn't even matter the
[04:03.680 --> 04:08.600]  point is is that they sit there for all we know Obama was grown in a test tube
[04:08.600 --> 04:14.120]  somewhere and just obsess over him and so for that he's very successful because
[04:14.120 --> 04:18.760]  he'll sell off in the sunset when this is all over and it'll take us a few years
[04:18.760 --> 04:21.720]  to figure out whoever else they put in his bad news unless it's Rand Paul or
[04:21.720 --> 04:27.240]  Ted Cruz let me tell you if Rand Paul or Ted Cruz got in power and really try to
[04:27.240 --> 04:31.280]  do something they'll get shot by a lone gun a lone government who's openly

[09:02.880 --> 09:10.000]  info wars.com MSNBC host says newborn infants don't count as alive and I saw
[09:10.000 --> 09:14.480]  that this morning at like 5 a.m. when I woke up and I thought well wait a minute
[09:14.480 --> 09:18.960]  didn't Watson just report on that two weeks ago where an MSNBC host said
[09:18.960 --> 09:23.040]  abort babies after they're born and I went and looked and it was another one
[09:23.040 --> 09:28.680]  the same lady that said that your kids aren't your kids Melissa Harris Perry
[09:28.680 --> 09:32.680]  we've got the transcript from MSNBC the video is not surfaced yet but it's on
[09:32.680 --> 09:36.200]  Breitbart too so Mike Adams reported I mean we know it's real we know she said
[09:36.200 --> 09:41.120]  it I just I want to find that video and then guys dig around I thought it was
[09:41.120 --> 09:46.440]  like two three weeks ago where another one said that another host it was a guy
[09:46.440 --> 09:51.160]  I mean I'm telling you this is a talking point folks they run promo ads on
[09:51.160 --> 09:56.240]  there saying your kids do not belong to you they belong to the state which I
[09:56.240 --> 10:01.880]  told you is in all the CPS textbooks in college I've people didn't believe it I've
[10:01.880 --> 10:06.840]  brought in one of my friends was going to school as a social worker for old
[10:06.840 --> 10:10.640]  people they're forced to do that you know the regular stuff for you know for
[10:10.640 --> 10:14.840]  families because you're trained in a wide range it was like hey this social
[10:14.840 --> 10:19.840]  work book says the families are cake and bad and has to be eradicated and I'd
[10:19.840 --> 10:26.640]  seen it at their house and talked about it this is like ten years ago and people
[10:26.640 --> 10:30.560]  didn't believe it so I brought the textbook in on air and everybody went
[10:30.560 --> 10:36.160]  crazy on the prison planet forum and found like no exaggeration hundreds of
[10:36.160 --> 10:40.600]  other books and examples whatever saying it you know the the the National
[10:40.600 --> 10:48.200]  Association of Psychiatrists the National Association of you name it this
[10:48.200 --> 10:53.560]  is standard that's why if the CPS comes to your house because your kid falls off
[10:53.560 --> 10:57.760]  the jungle gym and breaks their finger and you even got witnesses they're just
[10:57.760 --> 11:03.280]  like you despicable family because the goal is destroy the family and that's
[11:03.280 --> 11:08.800]  on record because then we could have the glorious all-state North Korea has
[11:08.800 --> 11:12.160]  done this without their population China only about a third lives in
[11:12.160 --> 11:16.840]  dormitories like this because it always collapses when they try it now tried it
[11:16.840 --> 11:20.920]  it's called the great leap forward cultural revolution those are two
[11:20.920 --> 11:24.160]  different groups it was a cultural revolution then the great leap forward
[11:24.160 --> 11:29.800]  came after the point is they tried to collectivize but basically a hundred
[11:29.800 --> 11:33.400]  percent of poor people it's called slavery they'd be a big slave bits you're
[11:33.400 --> 11:37.760]  free men with machine guns you work 18 hours a day and your kids are raised by
[11:37.760 --> 11:42.600]  us in another facility how's that freedom sound yeah it always is so much fun
[11:42.600 --> 11:46.720]  under commies let me tell you I'm a real square because I'm not intellectual and
[11:46.720 --> 11:51.840]  into it yeah the campaign was led by Mao Zedong and aimed to rapidly transform
[11:51.840 --> 11:55.120]  the country from an agrarian economy to a communist society through rapid
[11:55.120 --> 12:02.240]  industrialization and collectivization and you go read into it the great leap
[12:02.240 --> 12:09.200]  forward the cultural revolution was when he came to power in 1958 to 61 ladies
[12:09.200 --> 12:12.920]  and gentlemen they estimate that more than 40 million people died just during
[12:12.920 --> 12:19.240]  the great leap forward of 80 something mill the Chinese government says they
[12:19.240 --> 12:24.800]  killed our CIA loving group as they are they'll put Mao in power and 1949 says
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.120]  he only killed 64 million or 65 million and David Rockefeller wrote in the New
[12:29.120 --> 12:33.280]  York Times how when Mao died that communism is the way and that Mao is
[12:33.280 --> 12:37.760]  the model I had a copy of that it's the whole things online just type in David
[12:37.760 --> 12:40.960]  Rockefeller praises Mao Zedong my doc my guys will do it right now you're
[12:40.960 --> 12:44.240]  watching on TV just see how easy it is you can read an editorial New York Times
[12:44.240 --> 12:48.680]  how the greatest mass murder and history is a great guy see see here's the
[12:48.680 --> 12:52.880]  problem with my show I know too much and I'm not up here bragging on some
[12:52.880 --> 12:58.040]  narcissistic power trip okay like I know a lot and you don't I'm freaked out going
[12:58.040 --> 13:02.800]  look this stuff is over-the-top documented and I'm fighting every instinct
[13:02.800 --> 13:07.400]  I've got to as I've said jerk up everything and run to the most remote
[13:07.400 --> 13:11.640]  area of the world I can problem is those are all under tyrannies as well and I
[13:11.640 --> 13:14.280]  don't have the money to go to Switzerland and I don't want to leave
[13:14.280 --> 13:18.800]  America and watch it fall but man I tell you every day I look at my daughters
[13:18.800 --> 13:22.800]  especially how innocent and good they are and I that's why I hate myself this
[13:22.800 --> 13:27.400]  shows the opposite of like self-loving and oh I'm on a power trip it is oh my
[13:27.400 --> 13:31.200]  gosh this is real you have picked a fight with totally crazy control freak

[13:35.040 --> 13:42.200]  historical absolute demand and prime directive to go all the way Jones that's
[13:42.200 --> 13:48.120]  what I'm thinking at the same time I can't help my flesh the spirits willing
[13:48.120 --> 13:53.600]  but my flesh is not my flesh is get out of here what are you doing don't do that

[14:09.560 --> 14:14.120]  just telling you folks this is not a game okay this is not a game and
[14:14.120 --> 14:17.600]  everybody in the military and the police and the government and the
[14:17.600 --> 14:21.920]  corporations you better start doing whatever you can morally to really look
[14:21.920 --> 14:25.520]  at what you're being told to do not the cover story but what you really do and
[14:25.520 --> 14:30.200]  you better realize this country is being taken over by very criminal interest
[14:30.200 --> 14:36.680]  and if they get full control hell is going to be released K bar the door and
[14:36.680 --> 14:40.960]  you know that you know history your gut knows that all of you that work for the
[14:40.960 --> 14:44.240]  system and know how accurate I am because you're living it you're in the
[14:44.240 --> 14:49.560]  middle of it you've all got chills right now for a reason because we all know
[14:49.560 --> 14:58.960]  we're in grave danger everyone is in grave danger this is not a joke I keep
[14:58.960 --> 15:03.680]  trying to explain this to people this is not a game ladies and gentlemen you
[15:03.680 --> 15:09.120]  can't join this evil if we stand down and let that gate open hell is coming
[15:09.120 --> 15:14.320]  through it everything you've seen so far is just the vanguard scouts is the
[15:14.320 --> 15:19.440]  preparation is the enemy lining up you think this is a new world order of
[15:19.440 --> 15:23.800]  assault you're seeing a new world order assault was Mao say tongue killing at
[15:23.800 --> 15:31.080]  least 12% of the Chinese population in 20 years and a half of it or more in
[15:31.080 --> 15:37.640]  just three or four years and the Bible says the antichrist will kill over a
[15:37.640 --> 15:43.600]  third of the planet in just a few months whether you believe in the antichrist
[15:43.600 --> 15:46.920]  or not the antichrist believes in you this whole thing you see being
[15:46.920 --> 15:52.120]  manifested you can say the fantastic planet angle it's the subconscious mind
[15:52.120 --> 15:57.360]  of man the group collective builds this this this murderous art type and then
[15:57.360 --> 16:02.800]  evil people that tune into that for that frequency that mindset it's like a high
[16:02.800 --> 16:10.800]  school event you know before the big football game where everybody comes out
[16:10.800 --> 16:14.640]  what is that called pep rally but there's a certain type of pep rally what's
[16:14.640 --> 16:18.200]  the big one for like the big game the point is you know that electricity you
[16:18.200 --> 16:22.640]  feel in the air and the smell of the pheromones and you know the the electricity
[16:22.640 --> 16:27.160]  people's eyes because it's tribal like getting ready at the tribal camp to hop
[16:27.160 --> 16:31.080]  around and get ready for war and then the men all get hyped up and run off to
[16:31.080 --> 16:36.160]  die in battle that's where that comes from and they've hyped us up to turn our
[16:36.160 --> 16:39.960]  guns in and hyped us up to be slaves and hyped us up to go attack countries that
[16:39.960 --> 16:45.520]  didn't attack us they're programming this and but but just like there's a pep rally
[16:46.320 --> 16:51.240]  it's the big pep rally of the year I forget what it was it they would have
[16:51.240 --> 16:54.760]  cheerleaders sit there and have a drink orange soda out of a baby bottle and
[16:54.760 --> 16:59.000]  everything I don't remember I don't I played football I can't remember all
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.040]  at homecoming I think that's what it is it I can't remember any of this anymore
[17:04.040 --> 17:07.480]  the point is you all get hyped up for that just like there's a spirit you know
[17:07.480 --> 17:12.680]  a spirit rally a pep rally let's get the spirit up folks evil has a spirit it
[17:12.680 --> 17:18.720]  has a wavelength it has a crazed-eyed behavior and I'm telling you that's
[17:18.720 --> 17:22.880]  what's behind that door they've already knocked big holes in it they've got
[17:22.880 --> 17:27.200]  their people over the gates their people inside running things and they're
[17:27.200 --> 17:32.680]  saying open the drawbridge prosperity peace happiness it's all coming get rid
[17:32.680 --> 17:37.080]  of the family get rid of the process let us spy on you let us put black
[17:37.080 --> 17:40.840]  uniform police everywhere let us have checkpoints let the state run your
[17:40.840 --> 17:44.960]  children let the system control you it's for your safety give up your
[17:44.960 --> 17:54.200]  individualism historically and currently anytime that happens you should run you
[17:54.200 --> 18:02.760]  should run and people are not running folks they're just saying well what do I
[18:02.760 --> 18:06.600]  do about it or they're cowardly and are deciding to join with this and I didn't
[18:06.600 --> 18:10.120]  mean to come in here with a sermon the start of the broadcast today there's a
[18:10.120 --> 18:15.160]  lot of news I want to get to it's just that I'm more and more talk about what
[18:15.160 --> 18:17.720]  I'm internally going through because I know a lot of you were going through it
[18:17.720 --> 18:28.160]  as well and I realize with horror with horror that we've been very accurate and
[18:28.160 --> 18:33.240]  I wish I hadn't been so accurate I wish I almost feel guilty that I've been right
[18:33.240 --> 18:36.480]  you know what I mean like I wish I could be delusional and just oh everything's
[18:36.480 --> 18:40.320]  okay and then and and then somehow make it all right it's not going to be all
[18:40.320 --> 18:45.200]  right lying about this to ourselves just like the Pentagon head spokesman for
[18:45.200 --> 18:48.720]  public relations and basically public psyops the undersecretary of defense
[18:48.720 --> 18:54.200]  came out the mr. little and he said I've been authorized to tell you that we need
[18:54.200 --> 18:58.200]  to stop lying and we've lost all credibility and and and and and he
[18:58.200 --> 19:02.320]  basically said we've got to stop just stonewalling that tactic isn't working
[19:02.320 --> 19:08.280]  and then they kind of discuss how it's not a lie to just deceive people but to
[19:08.280 --> 19:11.840]  be the first to deceive it and don't just stonewall and the people look
[19:11.840 --> 19:16.640]  totally depressed in there and freaked out because they realize that it is just
[19:16.640 --> 19:21.240]  another psyop and this is really the announcement of the domestic military
[19:21.240 --> 19:25.480]  takeover of media which they but but but it's more than that because you can tell
[19:25.480 --> 19:28.160]  in the body language of little you can tell the body language of some people
[19:28.160 --> 19:31.520]  that get up there some of the kernels and generals and people and psyops that
[19:31.520 --> 19:35.920]  they're they're very concerned summer look like they're crying some look
[19:35.920 --> 19:40.400]  depressed some look happy that this is a big deal to get up there and say yeah
[19:40.400 --> 19:44.640]  we've been lying to people we've lost all credibility so so that psyop video is
[19:44.640 --> 19:50.280]  the top link on drudge Pentagon vows American people should hear it from us

[24:05.000 --> 24:29.880]  all right so this is a big deal to have scores of top White House advisors and
[24:29.880 --> 24:35.040]  spokespeople in the head of Homeland Security on and on and on from big sis
[24:35.040 --> 24:42.200]  to Jay Carney saying drudge is not credible stop looking at him stop
[24:42.200 --> 24:47.440]  listening to him he's losing credibility when it's the opposite it's not that I
[24:47.440 --> 24:53.120]  believe drudge has credibility it is even about credibility it's about when
[24:53.120 --> 24:58.560]  you go to drudgereport.com and link through to see a video of Obama saying
[24:58.560 --> 25:03.440]  I won't raise your payroll taxes and then show a new video of him raising the
[25:03.440 --> 25:09.560]  payroll taxes or if there's somebody saying I'm gonna get a free Obama phone
[25:09.560 --> 25:13.320]  you know I've gotten a hundred free Obama phones and he's gonna do more I
[25:13.320 --> 25:19.320]  mean that's what one of his supporters said or if Wiener gets caught lying
[25:19.320 --> 25:23.080]  about something they're gonna show where he lied before with the New York Daily
[25:23.080 --> 25:26.640]  News article and then show an article a month later where he gets caught in the
[25:26.640 --> 25:32.280]  Associated Press that's what they hate is that they don't want you to remember
[25:32.280 --> 25:36.320]  their last lie their last spin their last deception and places like drudge
[25:36.320 --> 25:43.040]  report.com do that that is in essence what they don't like and so now you have
[25:43.040 --> 25:48.520]  the Department of Defense come out and not attack drudge as the undersecretary
[25:48.520 --> 25:59.440]  of state gave a speech last week he did not he did not attack drudge he came out
[25:59.440 --> 26:04.000]  and said we need to be out in front of stories and not lie go watch the video
[26:04.000 --> 26:09.880]  because we're going to get caught we need to come out and tell the truth on a
[26:09.880 --> 26:14.840]  host of issues and again they're doing this because they know they've already
[26:14.840 --> 26:18.600]  lost all credibility they already know that they don't have the people's trust
[26:18.600 --> 26:23.960]  and the Pentagon is saying hey politicians everybody else and this is in
[26:23.960 --> 26:28.680]  the speech that just keeps stonewalling and lying to people about bullets about
[26:28.680 --> 26:34.040]  armored vehicles about drones it isn't working they're catching us in the lies
[26:34.040 --> 26:40.760]  we're naked we're wide open Toto pulled the curtain back there's no point in
[26:40.760 --> 26:44.360]  lying Joseph Kerbal's gave a speech from last year of Nazi Germany I think
[26:44.360 --> 26:48.800]  of 1944 you can pull it up I've seen the speech in a film you know with English
[26:48.800 --> 26:53.200]  subtitles he said you know to the SS you know we use propaganda on our own
[26:53.200 --> 26:57.600]  people before this is a you know filmed event we need to stop doing that we need
[26:57.600 --> 27:01.240]  to be truthful and admit we're losing the war and they're invading and they've
[27:01.240 --> 27:05.640]  landed and that we got a fight totally to beat them because it demoralizes
[27:05.640 --> 27:14.760]  people to know that we're lying to them the lies only work if they buy them and
[27:14.760 --> 27:19.960]  this is what we're talking about here look the Pentagon knows they're lying to
[27:19.960 --> 27:24.480]  people on up not just WMD's in Iraq but about our government running al-Qaeda and
[27:24.480 --> 27:29.400]  and they know that American interests are being sold out I have had so many
[27:29.400 --> 27:36.000]  former top Pentagon people on you've heard them from Colonel Shaffer did to
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.520]  Dr. Pachennick you name it in SA people you name it they say the entire
[27:40.520 --> 27:46.280]  military they almost everybody military NSA people they talk to FBI who aren't
[27:46.280 --> 27:50.040]  part of black ops or really corrupt units are awake freaked out and are
[27:50.040 --> 27:53.080]  in a very upset that's why there's all these threats against whistleblowers
[27:53.080 --> 27:57.800]  constantly is because the corrupt inner core of this coup d'etat this corporate
[27:57.800 --> 28:02.080]  illegal takeover are trying to intimidate people through the system to
[28:02.080 --> 28:06.160]  follow illegal orders and to intimidate and persecute people that tell the
[28:06.160 --> 28:13.480]  truth and so there's a real struggle here's the big news there is a struggle
[28:13.480 --> 28:17.800]  for the heart and soul of America and will we be part of this new world order
[28:17.800 --> 28:22.440]  and be sucked dry to fund the new world order Empire or will we start swinging
[28:22.440 --> 28:27.760]  the pendulum back in the right direction that's the big issue well you've
[28:27.760 --> 28:32.760]  got a official Pentagon top press briefing not even press briefing they're
[28:32.760 --> 28:38.760]  pressing they're there with the press pushing for for their own people to
[28:38.760 --> 28:43.680]  start pushing a culture of honesty and they say even do it with the officers
[28:43.680 --> 28:49.760]  that serve above you explain to them they've got a stop line because they
[28:49.760 --> 28:55.120]  realize ladies and gentlemen that it's the only hope they've got they now
[28:55.120 --> 28:58.840]  understand the institutions are going to collapse themselves the globalist plan
[28:58.840 --> 29:03.920]  to collapse America they realize the new world order is really a bad place to go
[29:03.920 --> 29:08.680]  they now realize the lies they've told they now realize that I've really
[29:08.680 --> 29:12.600]  analyzed this I've analyzed a lot of the other people's posture in high levels
[29:12.600 --> 29:16.840]  the fact that the last three chairman of the joint Jesus staff have basically
[29:16.840 --> 29:21.680]  resigned over not launching illegal wars against Iran and others show that
[29:21.680 --> 29:27.120]  there is a counter coup going on in government and it took a lot of courage
[29:27.120 --> 29:33.080]  to let people get up there from psyops unscripted it's unscripted and say I
[29:33.080 --> 29:37.280]  want to stop lying no one believes us anymore I mean that's the type of stuff
[29:37.280 --> 29:41.880]  in here I'm gonna continue to analyze how big this is but this is the Pentagon
[29:41.880 --> 29:46.360]  saying they're gonna stop lying to the public the White House and the in the
[29:46.360 --> 29:52.280]  Congress core they're all intensifying it we're on the March the empires on the
[29:52.280 --> 29:58.480]  run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:25.000 --> 33:30.560]  myself calm down a little bit and try to go over our top stories but this
[33:30.560 --> 33:35.440]  report up on info wars.com it's already scrolled off the front page I'm gonna
[33:35.440 --> 33:39.680]  have it put back up there is right up at the top of drudge report.com on the
[33:39.680 --> 33:43.780]  left-hand side and everybody needs to read it and the fact that drudge is
[33:43.780 --> 33:46.880]  linked to it is getting so much attention I probably want to fine tune it
[33:46.880 --> 33:51.440]  a little bit and maybe add some more of the transcript from the 35 minute press
[33:51.440 --> 33:58.120]  conference with the state of the DoD public affairs head of public affairs
[33:58.120 --> 34:05.880]  the undersecretary of state mr. Liddle because it's so incredibly important
[34:05.880 --> 34:10.040]  about fine-tuning you know I would kind of just sit there with the dawn my
[34:10.040 --> 34:13.840]  reporters record me and they kind of put as a transcript in the article and then
[34:13.840 --> 34:18.840]  I look at the article later and think you know I could have I could have
[34:18.840 --> 34:22.800]  fine-tuned that like there's stuff like I believe this shows how credible drudge
[34:22.800 --> 34:27.240]  is what there's no debate drudge is credible that's why it's so popular
[34:27.240 --> 34:30.720]  because he shows a wide spectrum of national international news raw
[34:30.720 --> 34:36.680]  government feeds he linked to the the Department of Defense transcript at the
[34:36.680 --> 34:44.760]  Department of Defense site Saturday and I saw comments on info wars and on the
[34:44.760 --> 34:48.440]  YouTube video saying this isn't real drudge isn't credible those are just
[34:48.440 --> 34:53.200]  bots and hired people and trolls folks that think you're weak-minded and are
[34:53.200 --> 34:57.280]  trying to create a debate about whether this is even a real DoD press conference
[34:57.280 --> 35:03.080]  I mean see that's what the Pentagon is saying is failing he says we've got to
[35:03.080 --> 35:08.640]  stop just lying and just saying something is it true it's gonna come out
[35:08.640 --> 35:15.840]  anyway and this is a big deal because it's only the DoD saying this because
[35:15.840 --> 35:21.000]  they're better experts at psyops than the White House is and there's also a lot
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.080]  better people in the military I can tell you that I have contacts very high
[35:26.080 --> 35:31.920]  level you hear some of them on air you hear some of them are off air and I mean
[35:31.920 --> 35:37.240]  they just say the entire Pentagon is completely freaked out and realizes we've
[35:37.240 --> 35:42.040]  been taken over and is very upset about what's happened in this nation and
[35:42.040 --> 35:45.600]  realizes there's a plan to basically implode us and get rid of the
[35:45.600 --> 35:49.480]  Republic entirely and they want the American people to get politically
[35:49.480 --> 35:53.760]  active and take the states back and elect good constitutionalist to
[35:53.760 --> 35:58.280]  government that's mainly the Ted Cruz Rand Paul type libertarians and we can
[35:58.280 --> 36:03.720]  fix this but every time I talk to these high-level officers former and serving
[36:03.720 --> 36:09.600]  they say look we're doing whatever we can inside you've got to help us we're
[36:09.600 --> 36:15.360]  we're in the government we're under a spotlight here so we've got we've got to
[36:15.360 --> 36:23.120]  stand up and give aid and comfort to the patriots in the government because the
[36:23.120 --> 36:28.160]  globalists are up there demonizing them the globalists get their aid and
[36:28.160 --> 36:31.640]  comfort from foreign offshore banks that have hijacked this nation to a great
[36:31.640 --> 36:36.720]  extent and we're in death rows struggling with this giant boa constrictor this
[36:36.720 --> 36:40.640]  around us and if we all focus collectively we can get this thing off
[36:40.640 --> 36:48.320]  of us but you've got to chop its head off by admitting we've been overrun you've
[36:48.320 --> 36:52.320]  got to chop its head off by really awakening and breaking the spell you
[36:52.320 --> 36:57.200]  got to chop the head off the snake ladies and gentlemen and I don't mean that
[36:57.200 --> 37:00.920]  they'll say that's just that's a code word for Obama now he's a puppet the
[37:00.920 --> 37:04.280]  worst thing that could ever happen and a propaganda victory for the globalist
[37:04.280 --> 37:08.520]  if Obama continues to plunge and it looks like he might get impeached or a
[37:08.520 --> 37:10.960]  bunch of whistleblowers come out and this thing starting to snowball
[37:10.960 --> 37:16.800]  governments fall corrupt governments coups fail all the time in history if
[37:16.800 --> 37:20.560]  that starts happening hey we don't want to get out of hand because something
[37:20.560 --> 37:23.560]  worse could come to the fore we just want to go back to the Republic that's
[37:23.560 --> 37:27.200]  why I say all these calls for evolution how about a revolution back to America
[37:27.200 --> 37:33.600]  forward to the 21st century a re-upload of 1776 where where the states go the
[37:33.600 --> 37:37.440]  federal government's been seized we pull out to reconstitute the original
[37:37.440 --> 37:42.840]  Republic that's my plan last year you know Alex Jones headline calls for
[37:42.840 --> 37:46.480]  second American Revolution and then I break down that in the Declaration of
[37:46.480 --> 37:51.360]  Independence we can do this however we see fit abolish the forms we become
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.080]  accustomed to to create new guarantees on our life liberty pursuit of happiness
[37:55.080 --> 37:58.240]  and it's our right our duty to do that well I believe out of all the systems
[37:58.240 --> 38:04.000]  created by man and the evidence shows that the system developed by our four
[38:04.000 --> 38:14.280]  bears between July 4 1776 and 1789 when the official system was codified that
[38:14.280 --> 38:18.880]  that is the best system ever developed and and I've studied it deeply and I
[38:18.880 --> 38:24.840]  got countless constitutional law scholars on constitutional lawyers on to
[38:24.840 --> 38:28.840]  say yes your plan is actually what the founding fathers would do and is
[38:28.840 --> 38:37.200]  actually rooted in ABCDEFG well of course I've read no exaggeration over a
[38:37.200 --> 38:40.880]  hundred books on the founding fathers and what happened and and listened to
[38:40.880 --> 38:44.720]  probably 50 or more books on tape and I mean I've gotten the big thick really
[38:44.720 --> 38:49.120]  wordy ones those ones I've had to read that have listened to book on tape and
[38:49.120 --> 38:54.280]  I drive to work or exercise so that I can actually you know see what was done
[38:54.280 --> 38:59.760]  and what happened and then compare it to the rest of history it's the plan to
[38:59.760 --> 39:06.520]  restore our republic and we need to follow it like we should probably find
[39:06.520 --> 39:10.520]  the transcripts Paul Watson did in the articles we wrote from last year where I
[39:10.520 --> 39:15.600]  called the second American Revolution and have those reposted info wars.com so
[39:15.600 --> 39:20.960]  that people can understand all I put in that battle plan was what common sense
[39:20.960 --> 39:25.480]  and the Constitution Bill of Rights Declaration of Independence stated you've
[39:25.480 --> 39:28.720]  got a lot of globalist Bilderberg group type people like Peter Thiel and others
[39:28.720 --> 39:34.880]  funding total anarchy so that these globalists can just be above the law
[39:34.880 --> 39:38.760]  after they've sucked everything dry and I'm telling you that'll create anarchy
[39:38.760 --> 39:42.400]  in the streets with the spoiled rotten demon public that the globalists have
[39:42.400 --> 39:46.920]  created we've got to slowly go out of this but recognize collectively big
[39:46.920 --> 39:51.200]  government and dependencies a nightmare has been wrong being an empire has been
[39:51.200 --> 39:55.360]  wrong the New World Order has been wrong the EU has been wrong the whole world
[39:55.360 --> 39:59.240]  government has already failed it was designed by banks to loot countries and
[39:59.240 --> 40:05.520]  it's a diabolical anti-human neo feudalistic system designed to make us
[40:05.520 --> 40:11.960]  poor and is authored by absolutely wicked out-of-control people and must be
[40:11.960 --> 40:17.680]  defeated that's where I'm getting at here so the toll-free number to join us
[40:17.680 --> 40:21.320]  we're gonna open the phones up we start the next hour so you can get lined up I
[40:21.320 --> 40:26.520]  love to hear from you may even go to him in the next segment is 800-259-9231
[40:26.520 --> 40:34.080]  800-2599-231 800-2599-231 and have your point your question ready because we're
[40:34.080 --> 40:38.400]  gonna go to you we don't screen the calls but it goes right into plugging
[40:38.400 --> 40:41.120]  something I'm gonna let you go because I realize that's what stalls the show is
[40:41.120 --> 40:45.560]  is that we don't screen the calls and so it just sometimes you know there's the
[40:45.560 --> 40:51.840]  bad calls come up the good but if you just joined us it's a big story folks
[40:51.840 --> 40:55.400]  government promises to stop lying because of drugs report spotlight and
[40:55.400 --> 41:00.240]  the word drudge and drudge report has become synonymous with alternative real
[41:00.240 --> 41:04.400]  independent media worldwide like Google became synonymous with search engines
[41:04.400 --> 41:07.960]  that's what's happened and so you have the whole White House and all the spin
[41:07.960 --> 41:14.000]  doctors and the Democrats in Congress and all these people saying drudge is
[41:14.000 --> 41:17.640]  incredible drudge is no and I was losing credibility because the because
[41:17.640 --> 41:24.800]  drudge is just in a in a in a in a rising tide of media singularity where
[41:24.800 --> 41:29.680]  there's so much media now not only is establishment media being imploded the
[41:29.680 --> 41:34.960]  of their fall in the fastest alternative media is becoming more diluted
[41:34.960 --> 41:38.400]  because there's so much but in the midst of it drudge just gets bigger and
[41:38.400 --> 41:44.640]  bigger and bigger like last man standing info wars is in that backdraft as
[41:44.640 --> 41:48.680]  well we're we're rising as well while pretty much the rest the alternative
[41:48.680 --> 41:52.960]  media individually is stagnant or getting smaller but the alternative media is
[41:52.960 --> 41:57.360]  getting bigger in the aggregate there are hundreds of millions of people
[41:57.360 --> 42:01.560]  getting into analysis and thinking you can say oh they're novices that's good
[42:01.560 --> 42:04.560]  everybody will start thinking and the natural great minds will come to the
[42:04.560 --> 42:10.760]  floor and it will create true real diversity of ideas and in a true market
[42:10.760 --> 42:15.800]  of ideas where the best will come to the top and that's what's happening
[42:15.800 --> 42:21.080]  survival of the fittest in the media so alternative media is displacing
[42:21.080 --> 42:28.040]  mainstream dinosaur parrot media prostitute media it is imploding lost
[42:28.040 --> 42:31.200]  all credibility the Pentagon has all the NSA metrics and data they know that
[42:31.200 --> 42:37.080]  it's been destroyed they realize that okay we went with evil at the top our
[42:37.080 --> 42:40.080]  people are demoralized our own troops know what's happening they're committing
[42:40.080 --> 42:45.320]  suicide at record levels we can see we're gonna implode this is unsustainable
[42:45.320 --> 42:48.680]  these bankers don't care they think that out of the global crisis they'll get
[42:48.680 --> 42:53.120]  even more power and they they actually are like meddling arsonist to get off
[42:53.120 --> 42:59.840]  on burning down societies and a lot of top people CIA FBI NSA Pentagon
[42:59.840 --> 43:04.040]  especially the Pentagon especially the Army and the Marine Corps it was the
[43:04.040 --> 43:07.160]  Marine Corps stopped the coup d'etat in the 30s they were gonna run with
[43:07.160 --> 43:14.400]  Smedley Butler I mean this has happened over and over again folks where the
[43:14.400 --> 43:18.440]  military is finally going wait a minute we don't want this is really evil and
[43:18.440 --> 43:22.960]  I'm telling you who has led the way with the true narrative for them with the
[43:22.960 --> 43:27.440]  history and it's the show and I can't believe in history I can say without a
[43:27.440 --> 43:30.360]  shadow of a doubt and praise God for this and thank you for your prayers and
[43:30.360 --> 43:34.840]  support folks we have analyzed this in 18 years and been laughed up up front but
[43:34.840 --> 43:37.800]  the whole military and I've always targeted the military openly because I
[43:37.800 --> 43:42.680]  knew how important they were in this fight they now know that I told the
[43:42.680 --> 43:45.720]  truth and that it all came true and so they understand now and they're
[43:45.720 --> 43:48.880]  listening right now ladies and gentlemen at military bases all over the world
[43:48.880 --> 43:52.040]  they're listening at the Pentagon right now they try to tell them don't do it but
[43:52.040 --> 43:55.440]  then that just makes everybody do it they backfired under Clinton Clinton did
[43:55.440 --> 44:01.520]  this for us the Lord works a mysterious ways in about 1997 memos went out to
[44:01.520 --> 44:05.480]  officers in the Marine Corps first then in the Army I started covering Delta
[44:05.480 --> 44:10.000]  force and special forces and and and operations they were doing to desensitize
[44:10.000 --> 44:13.200]  the public and I interviewed police chiefs that blew the whistle San Antonio
[44:13.200 --> 44:17.320]  police chiefs in Alice Texas police chiefs in Kingsville Texas the
[44:17.320 --> 44:21.440]  emergency manager these guys were all former Army special operations and
[44:21.440 --> 44:25.640]  psych warfare the people that went public the chief police of San Antonio was
[44:25.640 --> 44:30.320]  Army psy ops the head of Kingsville emergency Thomas Sanchez was former
[44:30.320 --> 44:37.240]  psy ops in Vietnam and Cambodia and when they got approached for
[44:37.240 --> 44:41.320]  desensitization for gun confiscation they went well they went public it was
[44:41.320 --> 44:45.600]  Texas again that went public and they would use any all that they could to
[44:45.600 --> 44:51.280]  warn people I went and interviewed these men and then the military started
[44:51.280 --> 44:55.000]  listening and Clinton they had a directive from one of the under
[44:55.000 --> 45:00.720]  secretaries that they were not to listen to Alex Jones I was nobody I had no
[45:00.720 --> 45:04.440]  web advertising I was selling I had one or two films that were paying for me to
[45:04.440 --> 45:08.600]  hire a few people I was just one guy in Texas who then sort of getting on a few
[45:08.600 --> 45:12.560]  other stations be an ISD in line at my house and the government said don't
[45:12.560 --> 45:15.680]  listen to him and so the whole Department of Defense said who's Alex
[45:15.680 --> 45:21.160]  Jones and then I learned I got some web advertising and we've gone back and
[45:21.160 --> 45:24.520]  even looked at the records because we've got some of that it was military
[45:24.520 --> 45:28.720]  people visiting our site and buying stuff day one that funded us Bill Clinton
[45:28.720 --> 45:32.920]  funded info wars calm by their people sent the traders that had gotten in
[45:32.920 --> 45:37.080]  government saying you don't go listen to that young man in Texas because who
[45:37.080 --> 45:40.240]  he's getting on the air how's he getting police chiefs on how's he getting
[45:40.240 --> 45:43.480]  emergency management heads on who were on I'm trying to tell the media
[45:43.480 --> 45:47.840]  Philip is told that the AP they came with bags of money to buy him off as an
[45:47.840 --> 45:50.760]  infiltration same thing they do in a third world he's like what are you doing
[45:50.760 --> 45:53.600]  here you're trying to infiltrate and take over the government of San Antonio
[45:53.600 --> 45:59.860]  he found out that most people in the city took the money 200,000 apiece 1997
[45:59.860 --> 46:05.280]  1998 AP reported on him saying it was bribery but not the rest of story so I
[46:05.280 --> 46:10.000]  called him he said yeah come down here I'll tell you what's going on
[46:10.000 --> 46:18.560]  imagine this is how you beat evil folks is by saying it's wrong and only now do
[46:18.560 --> 46:22.080]  I see the whole history of it and what went on and what happened I mean I was
[46:22.080 --> 46:27.480]  no rocket scientist when I was first on air 21 22 23 still no rocket scientist
[46:27.480 --> 46:31.240]  but I knew when I was told by military sources go to this drill you'll want to
[46:31.240 --> 46:36.400]  see this I go and they're trying to take guns from farmers I put it out the
[46:36.400 --> 46:40.040]  media responds it's because they know the the internet didn't have viral video at
[46:40.040 --> 46:44.000]  that time there was no YouTube he's lying there was no drill in Houston no
[46:44.000 --> 46:47.640]  helicopter crashed soldier of fortune since reporters find out finds out it
[46:47.640 --> 46:49.960]  happened
[46:51.240 --> 46:54.040]  that's print that article you just put on screen I want to see that that look
[46:54.040 --> 46:59.520]  shocking Obama Justice Department I'm gonna get to that after the break well
[46:59.520 --> 47:02.760]  then just put it on screen shocking Justice Department memo assault weapons
[47:02.760 --> 47:07.640]  ban won't work without confiscation and gun registration who's reporting on that
[47:07.640 --> 47:14.520]  now that's the Gateway pundit yeah we reported on that that's what I thought
[47:14.520 --> 47:18.120]  in February yeah yeah there's the article yeah info or supported on that
[47:18.120 --> 47:25.120]  too good job Gateway pundit but but I'm just up here ruminating on air about
[47:25.120 --> 47:30.380]  kind of cogitating about where this goes because there's a real crisis of
[47:30.380 --> 47:35.000]  conscious see see the system did not want to have a debate about this they
[47:35.000 --> 47:38.160]  just want to say that's not happening we're not creating a domestic secret
[47:38.160 --> 47:41.920]  army we're not trying to take on gun owners and veterans we're not training
[47:41.920 --> 47:46.520]  to take on conservatives libertarians it's it's crazy it's not happening and
[47:46.520 --> 47:51.320]  then it all came out five years ago okay we're not buying thousands of armored
[47:51.320 --> 47:56.440]  vehicles a year at 7000 plus giant war wagons it's 2000 this year 7000 the
[47:56.440 --> 47:59.720]  last three four years okay we're not training to take it just keeps coming
[47:59.720 --> 48:04.800]  out and so even the Pentagon walks out and says no one's believing us and we're
[48:04.800 --> 48:07.920]  about to engage in domestic sign-up operations and everybody's totally
[48:07.920 --> 48:11.240]  depressed looking down on the audience because they know this is a sign-up or
[48:11.240 --> 48:15.880]  then a sign-up or they or they think it could be some have tears in their eyes
[48:15.880 --> 48:24.240]  because folks they know at the Pentagon what what this means right here in my
[48:24.240 --> 48:29.480]  hand out of foreign affairs magazine put out by the Washington Post US
[48:29.480 --> 48:33.680]  repeal propaganda ban spreads government made news to Americans yeah and now I
[48:33.680 --> 48:37.960]  saw some of the fake news funded by the Department of Homeland Security it's
[48:37.960 --> 48:41.880]  on their own site I saw it yesterday while I was watching TV and I said
[48:41.880 --> 48:44.800]  that's a fake newscast and I went and looked it up and I found some older
[48:44.800 --> 48:47.560]  versions and a newer and I gave it to the guys I didn't play it yesterday I
[48:47.560 --> 48:51.880]  will play it later in the broadcast today they are now producing fake newscast
[48:51.880 --> 48:55.560]  about gun owners being arrested for being terrorist and are saying owning guns
[48:55.560 --> 49:02.240]  is terrorist to show weak-minded people that in between local newscast produced
[49:02.240 --> 49:08.000]  locally but funded by Homeland Security to create the illusion that gun owning
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.360]  is terrorism and that's why they had a room of hundreds of scyop officers and
[49:12.360 --> 49:17.640]  civilian scyop people going my god it's bad enough we lie to people overseas
[49:17.640 --> 49:22.280]  we're going to be doing this now to Americans but the director to roll it
[49:22.280 --> 49:26.200]  out is saying we're going to stop lying and so you saw some of the officers
[49:26.200 --> 49:29.840]  really looking freaked out because they were sophisticated enough the colonels
[49:29.840 --> 49:34.160]  and generals to know that was pure bull probably they weren't sure see nobody's
[49:34.160 --> 49:41.400]  sure the undersecretary has been told to go say this in prepared remarks so see
[49:41.400 --> 49:46.400]  there's scyops within scyops within scyops but it shows the dam has broken
[49:46.400 --> 49:49.520]  and they realize they've lost total credibility so now they're going to try
[49:49.520 --> 49:54.240]  to recon the military recon the scyop people recon army scyops they're
[49:54.240 --> 49:59.640]  listening right now and people say well that none of that makes sense but
[49:59.640 --> 50:04.280]  quantify it it isn't quantifiable it's it's con artistry folks so they're
[50:04.280 --> 50:08.880]  trying to gas like this basically but the question is once you're aware of the
[50:08.880 --> 50:13.160]  gaslighting it doesn't work anymore eight hundred two five nine nine two three
[50:13.160 --> 50:22.880]  one but this is a big deal this is a big deal and and at the heart of it is the
[50:22.880 --> 50:26.720]  fact that no one believes them anymore even when they tell the truth and they're
[50:26.720 --> 50:30.800]  losing more credibility they're hemorrhaging out right now and so my point
[50:30.800 --> 50:34.960]  is when I tweeted yesterday at real Alex Jones I said the new order could fall
[50:34.960 --> 50:39.680]  it's very close to falling in Europe they've beaten it in places like Iceland
[50:39.680 --> 50:43.720]  we're close to being in here they they may try to stage a big event bring in
[50:43.720 --> 50:47.200]  martial law but if the people in the Pentagon know about it that's not going
[50:47.200 --> 50:52.480]  to work so see this is almost a stalemate right now and we need to work
[50:52.480 --> 50:56.520]  towards a victory but that's gonna take all of us speaking out now at every
[50:56.520 --> 51:02.800]  level of society to defend the republic what does freedom mean to you how about

[55:12.160 --> 55:17.120]  thought it would ignore it but it can't do that anymore it's a big deal when the

[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:06.800]  hey buddy the both six months ago I read our article about the Soviet takeover
[01:01:06.800 --> 01:01:12.080]  the Baltic countries in 1940 and they said they described the people there
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.360]  described what they did they said the first thing they did there was they set
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.600]  up a surveillance system where they tapped into everybody's phone calls all phone
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:23.400]  calls are monitored they set up a neighborhood stench program they said
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:27.200]  that they they seized all the bank accounts they said if you had 4,000 in
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:31.640]  the bank account they took three and gave you a thousand they said everybody
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:38.840]  got a job there but it was just enough to pay the pay their rent and it put food
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.920]  on a table they couldn't go anywhere they couldn't better themselves they
[01:01:41.920 --> 01:01:44.800]  were just they were just surviving and that was it no that's right that that's
[01:01:44.800 --> 01:01:48.600]  what authoritarians will they be fascist or communist going back to Rome they
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:52.640]  just called it you know being enslaved is you domesticate by making people
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:57.960]  dependent you shut them down you surveil them and every form of tyranny
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:02:03.040]  that has been invented is now being deployed against us and the military
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:08.160]  the police everybody needs to know this and and within the Department of
[01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:11.440]  Defense the reason they've allowed them to come out and announce they're going to
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:16.200]  stop lying to us is to try to get credibility with the public so they
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:20.600]  can quote have psyops work with all local and alternative media they
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:24.240]  realize the citizen media is there they're going to try to take it down by
[01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:28.240]  being embedded like they've done before but also convince their own psyop people
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.840]  that they're still doing a moral operation and so it's very sophisticated
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:37.880]  but it shows a collapse level in that a lot of times they try to take over like
[01:02:37.880 --> 01:02:43.240]  this if the society the host society throws it off it can be an awakening
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:46.800]  for people that's what I'm saying we don't have to just go marching off to
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:50.880]  the end of the night I mean I'm sorry Romania's never really had freedom I'm
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:54.400]  sorry Poland really did never have freedom before the Soviets took over it
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:58.360]  had feudalism I'm sorry Russia never had freedom and had feudalism under the
[01:02:58.360 --> 01:03:02.920]  czars we are a little bit different and we sure got we're corrupt we've got a
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:07.800]  lot of big problems but I'm telling you we're not turning our guns in this is
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:13.440]  tyranny and if you want 1776 to start again globalist stage your terror attacks
[01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:17.360]  try to start your fight try to come arrest us all you're gonna lose the
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:20.600]  military's gonna end up siding with us and we're gonna come arrest you and we're
[01:03:20.600 --> 01:03:23.880]  gonna turn all the military machinery against you we're gonna go dig you out
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:28.640]  of your holes overseas Goldman Sachs JP Morgan all of you you want I mean I'm
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:32.760]  telling military even if you're evil this is gonna destroy your future
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:36.600]  they're gonna take your pension funds when they're done using you to destroy
[01:03:36.600 --> 01:03:39.880]  everybody they're gonna destroy you and you know that you know there's no
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:44.280]  honor among thieves and evil so it's time to pull back now I'll go ahead and
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:48.720]  finish up any points you got sir oh that are things that all the government
[01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:52.280]  officials listen in there you need to go back and study the Soviet system because
[01:03:52.280 --> 01:03:57.480]  they always turn on each other I mean both of the original Bolsheviks
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:00.640]  Stalin killed them all I mean Lee and Trotsky and all his followers are
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:04.400]  already annihilated I mean the system they set up turns and it just eats their
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.000]  own and let's get this straight they are taking the exact tyranny souping them
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:12.560]  up and deploying them and saying they're deploying it saying they've got purges
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:18.560]  ready and reeducation centers ready you know even using those type of terms to
[01:04:18.560 --> 01:04:26.160]  why mainline it emerge it make it no big deal get people to to accept it when

[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:20.000]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:31.280]  alex jones it's the top story on info wars dot com and one of the top stories
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:38.400]  on drugs report dot com and I've been talking about it a lot in the last hour
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:44.080]  because it's it's incredibly important last week to no mainstream media coverage
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:50.160]  last Thursday the head of dod public affairs and psyops under secretary
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:54.000]  little came out and said we've got to stop lying to the public we've lost
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.040]  credibility we're now going to help stop the lies by going and working with all
[01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:02.560]  the local blogs that have the credibility because the mainstream media
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.640]  doesn't have the credibility and the first one we want to work with basically
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:10.640]  is the drugs report we want to help you yeah they're like we don't want people
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.760]  to get their news from drudge after we've been caught lying we want them to
[01:09:13.760 --> 01:09:17.760]  get it from us so we're going to quit lying to have credibility the point the
[01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:21.400]  reason they've gotten to this point is that all the numbers show it
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:25.840]  mainstream media has no credibility congress has a 10% approval rating
[01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:31.320]  Obama's losing five points a week even with his constituents that bought into
[01:09:31.320 --> 01:09:37.080]  him like it was buying into a Madonna or Michael Jackson a celebrity people are
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.160]  really getting it and they're learning that in most areas of the country we've
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:45.240]  been in a depression since 2008 and things aren't getting better they're
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:48.880]  getting worse and they're shutting our power plants down and moving our jobs
[01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:54.680]  overseas paying to move them not just letting them go and so there is the big
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:58.000]  rude awakening and this is the time when governments and freefall and the
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.600]  corrupt industry and freefall for them to stage a false flag terror attack or
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:06.560]  let terrorists attack us to try to take our liberties they've put in and are
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:11.040]  trying to normalize now Obama is going to give you text messages about politics
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:15.960]  over your phone everyone I know including myself in fact I'm living in
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:20.680]  such a twilight zone that a few weeks ago I woke up at like 6 a.m. with a
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:26.640]  bzz and then bzz later when I didn't check the text message I have it on my
[01:10:26.640 --> 01:10:34.520]  phone a text message from my provider from the White House and it was you know
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:38.480]  telling me about things Obama was doing for the economy and now remember I tell
[01:10:38.480 --> 01:10:41.240]  you about the plans they have the government send you text messages a
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.920]  decade ago because they were talking about it then and break in over radio and
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:48.160]  TV and take over all the media systems and force all the internet browsers to a
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.600]  government message you're like that's crazy that won't happen I'm like no
[01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:55.440]  here's the here's the documents now it's oh yeah when there's a flu we're gonna
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:10:59.200]  tell you or when the president's got an initiative he's gonna text you and now
[01:10:59.200 --> 01:11:03.960]  they're going and you know what we're gonna break in and turn your phone on
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:13.160]  and make you get the messages and we're going to break in with video messages and
[01:11:13.160 --> 01:11:18.400]  oh it won't just be Obama it'll be the head of Homeland Security big sis and
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:24.320]  they put him in they said 860 something Walmart's got the federal money but
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:27.080]  last time I checked it was only a handful put them in because it was still
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:32.960]  too freaky Texas Minnesota California we've gotten videos that our reporters
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:38.840]  have shot and my listener also sent his footage of Minnesota at a super Walmart
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:44.440]  of the big sis we've shown it on the news saying hi big sis with you know
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:49.560]  Janet the Poletano here you say something say something you say something okay
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:54.640]  yeah I see a tyrannical government mirroring what the Soviets did but hi
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:12:02.560]  tech taking over yeah I mean this is the this is the type of of just cuckoo
[01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:08.720]  crazy stuff there's another longer video of it I think was the VST Silver Bowl
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:14.680]  you know that reporter he got it at the checkout counters actually has all the
[01:12:14.680 --> 01:12:18.680]  audio with her I mean imagine you're checking out there's big TV is going
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:24.720]  to watch each other don't trust anybody but me okay this is absolute
[01:12:24.720 --> 01:12:28.600]  tyranny I'm gonna go to your phone calls then get back into it and then just
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:32.680]  look at Obama on all of his big lavish vacations while he says you should be
[01:12:32.680 --> 01:12:35.760]  able to have air conditioning or a car they want to make you poor to control
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.120]  you and the last caller John out of Texas talked about knowing people that
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:46.200]  had been through and and knowing people who'd been in the government who had
[01:12:46.200 --> 01:12:49.800]  who had also witnessed show v at psyops when they took over eastern block
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:53.600]  countries first they set up a spy grid then a citizen spy grid then they
[01:12:53.600 --> 01:12:58.160]  demonize the independent press they demonize the family I mean they just go
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:05.000]  down the list folks when you turn on MSNBC it's something 60 years ago you'd
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:09.760]  get an amount reeducation camp but it but it would be on film reels you know
[01:13:09.760 --> 01:13:14.600]  red dawn tries to illustrate a reeducation camp they got up at the
[01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:19.960]  sports stadium with news reels 24-7 getting people to turn on each other
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.240]  breaking down the society finding out who will work with them and now the new
[01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:29.760]  army field manual just type in army field manual reeducation camp 2010 says
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:34.040]  reeducation camp they were that they're going to take political dissidents
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:38.640]  people that don't agree with the new federal family are going to be taken to
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:45.760]  be reeducated and that is a Soviet term they didn't say taken to be prepared to
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:49.720]  be reentered into society or sensitivity training which is a Soviet term to know
[01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:56.040]  it's they use the Soviet term so the military just gets used to it and then
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:14:00.600]  it comes out they're training contractors to kill peaceful protesters and it
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:05.160]  comes out there train of course they're doing this folks this is an attempt to
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:09.200]  get the military and police to carry out criminal actions and I don't want to
[01:14:09.200 --> 01:14:13.680]  shoot more folks if they start shooting peaceful protesters gloves are off folks
[01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:19.920]  and the military and police better join the people at that point not if they
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:23.120]  know what's good for them you're gonna lose I've looked at all the angles you
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:29.920]  you will lose but you'll lose by joining the pure evil I mean this is not like
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:38.440]  it's even debatable at this point I know I'm ranting I said I go to calls let's
[01:14:38.440 --> 01:14:47.480]  do it right now this is such a big deal that we're now at the point where they're
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:51.240]  announcing yes the army is going to be engaged in domestic psyops at point blank
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:54.320]  range against the American people but don't worry we come in peace we're
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:15:00.320]  gonna tell you the truth and all those psyops people in uniform would just look
[01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:04.320]  completely freaked out a they're gonna engage in stuff that's penny legal until
[01:15:04.320 --> 01:15:08.200]  last week because Obama says it's okay now it's they know it's already been
[01:15:08.200 --> 01:15:11.840]  going on covertly so they're like what what does this even do to announce it
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:16.040]  and now we're not gonna lie anymore they all fault what they all know about
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:20.360]  trillions missing from the Pentagon sex slavery being run by the contractors the
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:24.880]  drugs being flown in on the C-130 none of those people are stupid and they're
[01:15:24.880 --> 01:15:29.160]  all there just going wow we really work for the dark side America's really been
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:35.240]  taken over and the people now know it but the psyops run by Hollywood have
[01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:38.720]  demoralized the general public to the point of they know but are still so
[01:15:38.720 --> 01:15:43.560]  degenerate that most of them won't resist I mean it is a mess folks but at
[01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:47.360]  least we know what we're going into we're not gonna be caught flat-footed in
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:56.280]  any of this but the fact that info wars calm the things we talk about are now
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:16:03.520]  mainstream news really shows that there's a crisis of conscience happening
[01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:07.720]  and this is very positive overall and analyzing the undersecretary and
[01:16:07.720 --> 01:16:13.160]  analyzing the generals and analyzing the you know the Air Force TV producers that
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:18.640]  got up with tears in their eyes and said I don't like lying to people they
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:25.160]  don't believe us anymore I want to tell the truth and the undersecretary says
[01:16:25.160 --> 01:16:31.120]  we're gonna work on that and try to see imagine they know psyops in there they
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:36.360]  know what I'm talking about true they know how much trouble we're in they're
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:44.520]  like I didn't sign on to work for Stalin or Hitler but it's not one guy you can
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:48.120]  go after like Hitler and Operation Valkyrie I wish that was the case it's
[01:16:48.120 --> 01:16:52.920]  a demonic system a corrupt society the globalists have been smart about this
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:58.440]  they do it by committee and we're just living in times that are so incredible
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:02.360]  it makes my head spin that's all I could say here and the most await group is the
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:06.440]  military the next most await group if you believe they're not a police because
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:09.880]  there they know the bull they know they're told a lot of people they know
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:13.280]  the systems getting corrupt they know the argument is well we're under attack
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:17.080]  things are collapsing we've got to do it but now they realize we're not lying to
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.480]  try to fix freedom and have a free society we're lying to help the corrupt
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:26.600]  continue and that's right we need to let it all come out folks and even if America
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:32.340]  collapses that's better than going into a hyper tyranny for all of us and I
[01:17:32.340 --> 01:17:36.240]  don't even want that to happen I want to just convert away from tyranny back to
[01:17:36.240 --> 01:17:40.880]  the Republic prosecute the globalist but even if they just would leave the
[01:17:40.880 --> 01:17:44.760]  country the problem is they're not going to stop they got to be dealt with we've
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:48.720]  been hijacked by foreign banks we've been usurped those aren't terms that's a
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:52.800]  fact those aren't that's not rhetoric folks the globalist brag there's been a
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:59.360]  corporate takeover it's illegitimate it's illegal we got a clean house and I
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.440]  don't like being the tip of the spear but it's my duty let's go to Joe in New
[01:18:03.440 --> 01:18:10.640]  Jersey you're on the air welcome sir hi Alex Jones I want to be careful here
[01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:14.160]  because I don't want to be disrespectful and I don't want you to think I'm
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:19.040]  questioning you I'm questioning the system you yourself are stating how the
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:22.960]  level of psyops and tyranny goes beyond the bounds that we can even
[01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:31.000]  comprehend couldn't it be possible for a Psyop to be placed against the target
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.200]  dissidents that you were discussing in the form of a radio show like info
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:41.680]  works now I what I wanted to do is because I'm not like these other people
[01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:46.520]  who just trying to bat mouth you I want you to mean the private Psyop companies
[01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:50.440]  that we've proven attack is 24-7 on record saying we're government agents
[01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:54.400]  exactly I'm not like that I want you to be well just ask your question sir I
[01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.720]  don't care if you ask me a question go ahead well I don't want you know I don't
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:00.720]  want to put you know let me stop you right there because this is the thing I
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:04.840]  don't screen your calls but then everybody wants me to screen their calls
[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:11.520]  on air and a Psyop show would be screening calls but that's just about
[01:19:11.520 --> 01:19:16.440]  changing the subject over to Alex Jones quite frankly if weak-minded people
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:19.800]  want to think I'm an operative or something they're welcome to it because
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:23.840]  they've never counted anyways I'm looking for men and women who want justice
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:28.400]  and freedom and who are intelligent to try to restore the Republic and I'm
[01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:31.840]  here promoting the Bill of Rights Constitution transparency and not
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:35.480]  having a civil war and that our government's running al-Qaeda and that
[01:19:35.480 --> 01:19:42.000]  our government's is illegitimate any moron would know that I'm not a Psyop if
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:50.040]  I'm a Psyop I am the organic resistance to tyranny and so there's never any
[01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:54.560]  proof of a Psyop I mean my enemies will come to an event I've put on tell me to
[01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:58.960]  leave my own event shoot deceptive angles as if I've crashed my own event to
[01:19:58.960 --> 01:20:03.080]  then say that I go crashing events when I can go speak to 5,000 people next week
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:06.920]  if I wanted to they do Psyops like sit behind me and yell kill Michelle
[01:20:06.920 --> 01:20:10.520]  Malcolm and have the national news ready to run that I say he said kill Michelle
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:14.920]  Malcolm they run hoaxes and say that I said Obama sent a tornado to the thing
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:19.760]  they have the globalist attacking me trying to bring me down running dirty
[01:20:19.760 --> 01:20:24.480]  tricks you couldn't believe and then you call in and say what if your shows a
[01:20:24.480 --> 01:20:28.640]  Psyop let's just stop right there for your mind let me explain how Psyop works
[01:20:28.640 --> 01:20:33.760]  okay there's many different types the ultimate Psyop in the cognitive
[01:20:33.760 --> 01:20:37.680]  infiltration of Cass Sunstein that he wrote about six years ago at Harvard
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.360]  five years ago at Chicago Business School and four years ago at the White
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:46.280]  House and then two years ago as its regulations are and public speeches and
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:51.320]  the rest of it was to create fake alternative media to claim they were
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:54.960]  conspiracy theorists people that question go read it to fight with each other
[01:20:54.960 --> 01:20:58.920]  and claim all the real people are agents show that there's no clear
[01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:04.160]  leadership to make the debate about who's real in the movement classic divide
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:08.600]  and conquer instead of let's get foreign banks out of America let's stop
[01:21:08.600 --> 01:21:12.840]  having them shut down our power plants let's stop having them ship General
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.840]  Motors of China with taxpayer money 21 billion let's get the federal government
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:20.760]  out of education out of our churches let's stand up for free speech let's
[01:21:20.760 --> 01:21:24.800]  keep our police local let's have a states rights movement to block Obamacare
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:28.680]  what you're starting to happen let's get people that they can believe in each
[01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:33.200]  other and have an option from tyranny and collectivism let's keep our families
[01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:38.360]  together let's not abort babies the vaccines are dangerous GMO is dangerous
[01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:43.680]  filter your water I mean my god if I'm a and it's a pure distraction now you got
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:47.120]  one minute there's no evidence
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:56.120]  and it's a pure distraction now you got one minute I gotta go to other people go
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:22:01.840]  ahead I do not want to just there he goes boom boom boom boom give me the proof
[01:22:01.840 --> 01:22:07.520]  of the psi up man the psi up is I got red blood you got it come on come on come
[01:22:07.520 --> 01:22:12.400]  on there's a thing called you it's uh you have to state to the public audience
[01:22:12.400 --> 01:22:16.960]  what you're going to do by you reading from the AP from the news sources that
[01:22:16.960 --> 01:22:21.520]  are already designed and designated illegitimate you're doing nothing but by
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.360]  perpetrating the false pin story that is already being put out there by these
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:29.960]  news sources there's a thing called mine doors written in 1980 which specifically
[01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:34.600]  details your radio show it's specifically details your show man your
[01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:38.600]  show's named info wars I don't want to I want you to be legit but there's
[01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:42.560]  legitimate issues there man there are real things that I don't want you to
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:47.200]  have to try and answer this now take your time research it research it okay
[01:22:47.200 --> 01:22:52.720]  why would I research if if I was a psi up how would I research that I know I'm
[01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:57.560]  not and I hope you're not I actually believe you're not that's what I'm
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:00.120]  saying I'm almost trying to give you the opportunity because you talk about
[01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:04.080]  infighting so much well there's the truth movement I don't know if you've
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:08.120]  noticed it's put up between people who believe Alex Jones and who don't believe
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:10.760]  that I know that's the style look look I appreciate your call and I'll let you
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:15.520]  talk some because you actually made a couple points and the issue is do you
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:22.760]  understand sir the psi up is that now we're going to debate Alex Jones and is
[01:23:22.760 --> 01:23:28.680]  is is he for real instead of the fact that the mainstream media has lost all
[01:23:28.680 --> 01:23:33.440]  credibility and the states are moving to try to defend our second amendment
[01:23:33.440 --> 01:23:39.960]  everything else it's amazing it's very very sad and the people always say the
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:47.480]  same thing respond to every fake claim so that my show becomes a response to
[01:23:47.480 --> 01:23:54.280]  fake claims and not about the news and the issues and how the world works of
[01:23:54.280 --> 01:23:59.720]  course I'll take a White House transcript and show how they're lying and
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:06.280]  post the transcript and then say where they're lying of course I take a video
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:09.480]  I see that in the comments why are you showing Obama and his propaganda well I
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:14.000]  show Obama saying you know that he wouldn't hire any lobbyist three times
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:18.800]  here and then I show him right below it hiring record lobbyist I mean it's
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:24.760]  almost like childlike like like the only psi off I could be guilty of is
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:29.680]  misgaging the public by thinking people are like me and I've admitted this and
[01:24:29.680 --> 01:24:33.720]  I've tried to think of where I helped the system because nothing's perfect and
[01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:38.720]  undoubtedly that the system's not one monolithic thing either that's a psi
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:41.920]  op as well but I realized that when I get up here and talk about all this
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:46.040]  horrible news sometimes for people that are scared and not empowered it may make
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:50.560]  them give up and have learned helplessness but but but I believe in
[01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:54.440]  standing against a threat I mean you know some guy comes to start to fight
[01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:58.040]  with me I try to diffuse it but they start swinging I start stomping their
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:03.200]  butt in the ground I mean I it's not so I don't like roll over and show my belly
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.080]  folks and so I'm I mean what you're getting is an American fighting stance
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:16.120]  that's as Americana as anything's ever been or is just free human and I go in
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:23.280]  again that's the psi off and you know I'm sitting there with Vic Vreeland a
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:30.120]  firefighter he comes up to the station I'm friends with him he's has an access
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:35.160]  TV show he comes up to KJFK in 1996 late 1996 and he goes you need a website
[01:25:35.160 --> 01:25:38.400]  come over to my house that had dinner there before with him and his wife and
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:44.560]  his kids were growing up and I've had Vic Vreeland on forever and I and I go
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:48.000]  over to his house in Petey oh that old parrot died I was real sad to hear Petey
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.120]  died I haven't seen Vic Vreeland in years and I'm having dinner with him and his
[01:25:51.120 --> 01:25:55.000]  wife and he says I'm gonna set up a website for you we sat around for a
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:00.160]  couple hours thinking what's a name what's a name what's a name and I of
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:03.600]  course I've read so many history books and things I said well we need to you
[01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:11.400]  know call it info wars and he said yeah because there's a war on for your mind
[01:26:11.400 --> 01:26:13.800]  he'd also been in the Air Force
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:18.200]  firefighters and tell no Vic Vreeland he was a singer a senior firefighter when
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:24.880]  he retired he had just about retired then last time I heard he retired out to
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.120]  Bastrop or something we get Vic Vreeland on that was a great guy man that was a
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:34.840]  great guy and I think he'd been filled in a few times for like Tom Valentine
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:43.200]  that great Patriot talk show host but I remember sitting there while Petey
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:50.000]  while Petey sat on my lap and I fed him peanuts big ol' cockatoo and we had a
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:56.360]  good Italian dinner over there I think it was his wife was Italian but the point
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:26:59.480]  was maybe Vreeland is I don't remember and I sat there and that's where info
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:02.880]  wars came from and then I sit there and here's some guy you know because back
[01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:07.520]  then people weren't getting good domain names and then I and now the whole show
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:11.040]  gets taken over by that it's very painful it's very very sad but it's not
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:16.840]  just psyops people are jealous of success and so you can be a big man if
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:20.880]  you make something up about Alex Jones that I'm Bill Hicks that I work for the
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:24.080]  Vatican when I'm not even Catholic nothing against Catholics I'm attacked
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:27.680]  because that because I don't attack Catholics or that I work for the Masons
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:32.600]  or that I work for and I'll get up on air and say I've had family that were
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:37.880]  Masons high level and they said don't become part of it and then that proves
[01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:42.680]  I'm a Mason because high-level Masons in my family have said there's some pretty
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:48.200]  bad stuff in it at the highest levels and or I say I've had family in the army
[01:27:48.200 --> 01:27:52.400]  recruited by the CIA who got out of it saying it was really bad and then that's
[01:27:52.400 --> 01:27:57.200]  the proof I'm CIA I mean how do you expect whistleblowers to ever come out
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:01.320]  or ever say anything if when they do you go you must be a psyop you don't know how
[01:28:01.320 --> 01:28:07.600]  to judge things and I guess it's a wrecked fluoride head population I get
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:14.640]  that but I'm not gonna be diverted off that I answered your question I mean
[01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:18.920]  let's say I was a bad guy which I'm not you know on my children that means
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:23.720]  nothing in front of God but God knows
[01:28:24.400 --> 01:28:29.760]  isn't it about you what are you doing to go warn people and they say it's the
[01:28:29.760 --> 01:28:33.280]  law every year in every public school system to take vaccines they give them
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.800]  five six seven eight nine ten fifteen shots at a time and kids actually pass
[01:28:36.800 --> 01:28:40.240]  out when they're doing thousands of nocculations they may have 20 people go
[01:28:40.240 --> 01:28:43.720]  to the hospital they have ambulances standing by kids go into the third round
[01:28:43.720 --> 01:28:46.720]  of shots when they're 18 months have convulsions in the hospital are you
[01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:49.680]  there warning people do you walk up to pregnant women and warn them in stores
[01:28:49.680 --> 01:28:53.360]  because you know what I do and not because I'm some goody-to-shoe I'm
[01:28:53.360 --> 01:28:57.160]  worried about that kid do you go and warn people about fluoride in the water

[01:32:20.280 --> 01:32:25.720]  from compulsory state education to the Hollywood media brainwashing machine we
[01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:29.920]  are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions when
[01:32:29.920 --> 01:32:33.720]  somebody obscures that feedback loop between you observing and testing it
[01:32:33.720 --> 01:32:37.280]  out and verifying if they can take total control of your awareness all of this
[01:32:37.280 --> 01:32:41.440]  is happening so fast you need to be ahead of the game how to engineer the
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:45.720]  opinion of the American people so that they would not only endorse but demand
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:55.280]  war because there's a war on for your mind get your copy of state of mind the

[01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:24.480]  it's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:33:24.480 --> 01:33:32.240]  you know I'm actually glad that guy called but it's like calling up and
[01:33:32.240 --> 01:33:35.520]  going how do we know you're not a rapist or how do we know you're not robbing
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:39.080]  banks or how do we know you're not got children buried in a basement in your
[01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:45.560]  house and it's it's it's like fighting words but don't you expect if there was
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:50.880]  an Alex Jones a guy who for 18 years climbed up their little buddy radio
[01:33:50.880 --> 01:33:55.640]  stations and you know today is on mom and pops across the country and has been
[01:33:55.640 --> 01:34:00.320]  able to you get people nationwide really talking about the tyranny we're going
[01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:05.280]  into the globalists haven't fully taken over yet and we're desperately trying to
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:09.120]  hold it back trying to keep the gate shut they're climbing over and people are
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:13.280]  like how do you know there's something behind that gate that's one half the
[01:34:13.280 --> 01:34:16.520]  population you know that's in denial and the other half is in denial like how
[01:34:16.520 --> 01:34:19.600]  do we know you're not one of them and I'm like I'm holding this gate back get
[01:34:19.600 --> 01:34:23.040]  up here and help me and spears are coming through it and fireballs are
[01:34:23.040 --> 01:34:26.440]  coming over the top of the deal and they're standing around going no I say
[01:34:26.440 --> 01:34:32.280]  you're with the army on the other side you judge a tree by its fruits and I
[01:34:32.280 --> 01:34:36.720]  think that guy just was uninformed but a lot of the people pushing that line are
[01:34:36.720 --> 01:34:40.640]  definitely for the other side I say the people holding the gate up are actually
[01:34:40.640 --> 01:34:45.400]  with the enemy how about we arrest them and leave no one at the gate how dare
[01:34:45.400 --> 01:34:50.720]  that person fighting the New World Order I bet he's one of them you judge a tree
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:54.840]  by its fruits how many globalist operations have we blown wide open and
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:59.200]  damaged how much do they hate us how much do they lie about me trying to
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:05.880]  destroy me believe me you know who knows I'm for real God knows what the New
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:12.880]  World Order knows to let me tell you what boy I tell you but folks don't even
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:18.400]  defend me I've said this many times to my listeners do not defend me on YouTube
[01:35:18.400 --> 01:35:23.600]  and info wars calm and other sites don't feed the trolls find an issue that
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:27.120]  you've researched that you know is accurate warn other people get involved
[01:35:27.120 --> 01:35:31.800]  fight the New World Order the globalist want to divide and conquer us we teach
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.640]  this over and over again it's common sense its history everybody already knows
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:39.360]  that and Cass Sunstein said we're gonna go in and say everybody in the truth
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.600]  movements of government agent I'll be honest with you most of them are not
[01:35:42.600 --> 01:35:46.800]  government agents that are infighting they're just jealous envious screwed up
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:52.200]  bad products of the society narcissists that are into this try to be stars not
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:56.400]  into liberty for the great animating contest for a future for their children
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:35:59.880]  because they're very guts they're very sinew they're very cells they're very
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:07.880]  soul they're very stamp their very essence is to be free and to be just
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:14.760]  outraged by manifest corruption I see big purple green clouds on a spring day
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:19.360]  and funnel clouds spinning I don't need to get my iPhone now and look and see if
[01:36:19.360 --> 01:36:23.040]  there's tornadoes forming I know to try to get to shelter because I've grown up
[01:36:23.040 --> 01:36:30.200]  around tornadoes in Dallas Texas saw him every year with my eyeballs that's
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:33.800]  why when I hear there's more tornadoes I look up the numbers there's 60 year low
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:39.560]  I hardly ever see him now I saw him all the time when I was a kid don't believe
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.360]  me the National Weather Service says 60 year low for tornadoes but the point is
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:49.280]  I've seen it I know it people know common sense when they see it and the
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:53.480]  globalists just want to change the subject till I got you know he's talking
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:57.480]  about cancer viruses and vaccines and telling you it's declassified look it up
[01:36:57.480 --> 01:37:04.040]  what you could do in five seconds he's a Vatican assassin Charlie Sheen admitted
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:08.920]  it and then people go we'll prove you're not a Vatican assassin Charlie Sheen
[01:37:08.920 --> 01:37:16.160]  said you and here Vatican assassins folks Charlie Sheen is a comic person and
[01:37:16.160 --> 01:37:20.880]  we've sat around at his house many times his favorite form of entertainment is
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:23.400]  also one of mine I don't do it now because it's it's bad I've repented of it
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:27.400]  is watching attack videos because they're so funny watching schizophrenics on
[01:37:27.400 --> 01:37:31.120]  YouTube the because there are a lot of schizophrenics now that never before had
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:35.200]  a venue to a to a newspaper basically that's part of this new free press you
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:38.800]  know someone argue that's what I am but we know I'm just basically eccentric and
[01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:42.560]  I think have high intelligence obviously in a study some history but I mean it's
[01:37:42.560 --> 01:37:46.480]  it's entertaining to watch schizophrenics that think you know the water meter
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:50.040]  reader as a CIA agent outside their house and to sit there and watch it it's
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:53.800]  it's funny to watch people you know you know saying and I'm really a reptoid or
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:57.880]  real Hicks I mean it's it's funny until the you realize the family's upset about
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:02.680]  it it's very painful to the Hicks family that people have actually contacted them
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:07.600]  and said we know your son's not dead and stuff like that but but but you know
[01:38:07.600 --> 01:38:10.640]  when he's buried and I've talked to them and they were there when he died and it
[01:38:10.640 --> 01:38:15.280]  was very sad and you know you that's the type of stuff going on out there because
[01:38:15.280 --> 01:38:21.280]  the establishments lost all credibility they're a pack of liars now the dumb
[01:38:21.280 --> 01:38:25.720]  down mass that at least had the rudder of mainstream media to believe that now
[01:38:25.720 --> 01:38:29.720]  they don't know what's true so they're just making up what's true for whatever
[01:38:29.720 --> 01:38:34.000]  they want I mean if I tell you about the CIA I've read dozens of books on it and
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:37.720]  studied it and watch congressional hearings or if I tell you I know about
[01:38:37.720 --> 01:38:42.960]  GMO I've interviewed let's not exaggerate hundreds of experts and doctors and
[01:38:42.960 --> 01:38:47.160]  genetic engineers and top scientists and patent holders on you know some of the
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:51.480]  top GMO out there they that they tell you does kill the rodents that eat it and
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:39:01.880]  and and just constant research and living it and so I don't blame a dumb
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:04.920]  down mass out there that's smart enough to know they're being lied to but not
[01:39:04.920 --> 01:39:08.440]  smart enough to figure out what's going on cast Sunstein says well we'll just
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:11.120]  get them all fighting with each other we'll go and we'll put out fake
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:15.520]  conspiracy theories we will just muddy the water so much and we'll get
[01:39:15.520 --> 01:39:18.400]  everybody fighting with each other and we'll target our real opposition by
[01:39:18.400 --> 01:39:23.600]  saying their feds go read it so that then the whole debate becomes about that
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:28.440]  and and and it's effective if you don't ill effect all people say that was a
[01:39:28.440 --> 01:39:35.200]  psyop him letting that guy be on well no it's not because I then used it as a
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:40.040]  teaching moment that's what I do from my perspective doesn't mean I have all the
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:44.440]  answers first I go through anger then I go through sadness then I just go
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:49.080]  through analyzing it and covering it for the person because it's painful to
[01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:52.960]  realize that there are millions of minds shuttered who will now be completely
[01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:56.880]  nasty their whole life believing anyone that resists tyranny is the worst
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:00.600]  because you notice half the radio shows half the websites half the YouTube's I
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:04.400]  mean literally half they don't fight the New World Order folks that's that's too
[01:40:04.400 --> 01:40:07.720]  big and powerful for them they can't imagine they could ever beat something
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:11.520]  there even though they could but it's easy to to you know fight with each other
[01:40:11.520 --> 01:40:14.360]  they don't even really attack me now I've kind of reached the point where they
[01:40:14.360 --> 01:40:17.280]  think they can't you know hurt me or whatever in a way they can't because
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.360]  it's not true and so much bull but when you're fighting globalist and it is true
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:25.640]  and you've got real evidence you can hurt them oh but forget trying to slay
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:29.840]  that real giant politically let's just all tear each other apart in a mass
[01:40:29.840 --> 01:40:36.800]  schizoid you know crazy narcissist event and it's television that's turned
[01:40:36.800 --> 01:40:40.880]  people into this the brains have been wired wrong the society is getting sick
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:46.400]  and it's a crisis let's talk to drew in Florida drew it on the air go ahead how
[01:40:46.400 --> 01:40:49.440]  you doing Alex good you think that was instructive what talked about or you
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.640]  disagree I think you're doing a great job I don't care what other people say
[01:40:53.640 --> 01:40:58.280]  I'm a first-time listener long-time caller I read I saw this article about
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:02.960]  Michael Hastings and I had a video of the crash it's on LA Times it's called
[01:41:02.960 --> 01:41:07.960]  Michael Hastings death new crash video emerges and on the links it has new
[01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:12.440]  video and it's deleted now but I uploaded to my I downloaded it analyzed
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:17.840]  a frame by frame by frame and you can clearly see some be ejected from the
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:22.800]  big from the vehicle right before it blows up I sent a link I messaged
[01:41:22.800 --> 01:41:27.160]  David Knight and the Don Salazar on Facebook no no I actually we posted this
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:31.320]  yesterday we're playing the video now for TV viewers the LA Times is reporting
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:37.320]  it and last time I checked the link is still up new video what they believe
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:42.200]  emerges and it's a really grainy camera shot of a black and white surveillance
[01:41:42.200 --> 01:41:48.960]  camera showing a car going what looks about 70 miles an hour or so maybe 80 and
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:54.680]  then looking like you see like a little explosion before it hits something you
[01:41:54.680 --> 01:41:59.560]  see a flash and then it looks like it blows up in a larger explosion off the
[01:41:59.560 --> 01:42:03.440]  road and who knows if it's real but but quite frankly it looks like you see it
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:08.320]  driving something detonates then it goes on another 50 yards or so up against the
[01:42:08.320 --> 01:42:12.000]  tree but it doesn't even look like the side of the road we'd previously seen so
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:16.760]  I don't know if it's real or not LA Times doesn't know what's your take on it
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:22.080]  I noticed that as I analyze a frame by frame at 14.5 seconds just like you said
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:26.360]  you see something going the opposite way the vehicle now is that the way the
[01:42:26.360 --> 01:42:31.600]  engine traveled because he was right before the explosion if we check a 14.5
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:36.640]  seconds and at four frames you see something before the explosion I don't
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:41.720]  know if it's a reflection off the side yeah we've now confirmed it's been taken
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:46.680]  off the LA Times in the original place so reportedly investigative journalist
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:52.440]  got access to a restaurant and got it and who knows maybe it's got something
[01:42:52.440 --> 01:42:57.960]  we're not supposed to see because it's being pulled everywhere and and so you
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:02.760]  see it driving then the flash under it then it blows up looks pretty suspicious
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:07.280]  to me yeah I just uploaded to my YouTube video because I downloaded it off the
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:11.280]  web when it came out so I can analyze it and it's on my YouTube page you know I
[01:43:11.280 --> 01:43:16.080]  saw the video yesterday and just looking at it again on the big screen in front
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:21.080]  of me you clearly see a flash under the car long before then the big explosion
[01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:25.680]  well but that's amazing and again I get so overwhelmed so many times the show
[01:43:25.680 --> 01:43:30.080]  ends and I go oh I didn't cover ten ten things you know I wanted to cover I'm so
[01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:34.080]  glad that's why we take calls that you brought that up yeah I know it looks like
[01:43:34.080 --> 01:43:38.000]  a bomb goes off underneath it you see a pretty good explosion and then it goes
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:46.680]  on down the road and that's what that's what that's what witnesses said is that
[01:43:46.680 --> 01:43:52.240]  the car was going down the road blew up and then Jack knife flipped and then
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:56.040]  went off into the tree and that's what the video looks like but again we don't
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:00.160]  know if it's real LA Times doesn't know the investigative reporter it's off his
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:04.200]  site now that says he let's call him immediately email him call that guy
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:08.360]  immediately and ask him why it's gone that should be a big news issue right
[01:44:08.360 --> 01:44:11.800]  there it's clearly fair use for us to be able to know what's going on this is a
[01:44:11.800 --> 01:44:16.400]  person that was killed said he was going into hiding being chased hiding for his
[01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:21.400]  life about to break a big story on the CIA domestically and then his car blows
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:24.840]  up and they say don't investigate it very suspicious thank you so much for the
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:31.240]  caldera let's go ahead and talk to George in Texas you're on the air Alex
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:38.080]  hey bud thank you for everything that you're doing for us it's so important
[01:44:38.080 --> 01:44:41.840]  well listen what comes around goes around but let's be clear I am a giving
[01:44:41.840 --> 01:44:45.600]  loving person but I'm doing this for my family and I'm doing this because I can't
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:50.000]  control myself I mean when I see tyranny taking over doesn't everybody want to go
[01:44:50.000 --> 01:44:55.440]  resist it I mean isn't that normal I'm just saying folks don't thank me it'd be
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:59.760]  like the compulsion of I was a single guy you know and then Marilyn Monroe at
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:04.040]  her peak wanted to date me I mean don't thank me for dating Marilyn Monroe I was
[01:45:04.040 --> 01:45:08.160]  a single guy and she's at her you know prime and wanted to date me it's like
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:12.240]  you know don't thank me for one in the lottery here I mean I mean and my point
[01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:15.520]  is I don't deserve to be thanked I mean why would I not want to fight the
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:19.520]  tyrants you see what I'm saying no I do and actually what I wanted to say was
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:23.760]  when I was growing up I always wondered what it would be like to shake the hand
[01:45:23.760 --> 01:45:30.400]  of George Washington or Paul Revere and you shook my hand and I felt it stoked
[01:45:30.400 --> 01:45:36.600]  the fire in my heart for liberty against tyranny and I want to tell people that
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:42.480]  they need to understand Alex Jones is the archetypal living spirit of Paul
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:49.920]  Revere oh don't go there I felt it I felt it shaking your hand fulfilled my
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:55.960]  childhood dream even more than that I knew that I was reaching out and touching
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:46:00.840]  the hand of freedom and history itself well let me tell you it humbles me you
[01:46:00.840 --> 01:46:05.120]  know I don't like doing public events is so humbling to see the light of liberty
[01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:10.600]  and the concern and how good our average listeners are it is so humbling it
[01:46:10.600 --> 01:46:16.800]  makes me want to cry and but it feels weird to me to have people admiring me
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:21.640]  I mean do you see what I'm saying it's like that's because I just want to fight
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:25.920]  the globalist I don't want to be it's like George Washington he didn't want
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:28.960]  to be president he wanted to get out of there and go back to his beautiful farm
[01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:33.440]  and his family and his dogs and I'm not saying I'm George Washington folks
[01:46:33.440 --> 01:46:37.480]  believe me I didn't George Washington you see all these Hollywood movies come
[01:46:37.480 --> 01:46:40.800]  in the barbarian all this stuff and you think oh that's over the top I mean
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:45.400]  George Washington's life the whole thing is like more over the top than a movie
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:49.760]  and that's why you never see a movie about it or they make him look like no
[01:46:49.760 --> 01:46:53.600]  big deal because they don't want you to have an idea of how incredible it was
[01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:59.000]  like he was in more than 50 battles where he would be up front with him
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.120]  shooting cannons and rifles at him and he wasn't being killed people all being
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:07.440]  killed around him I mean he was done before he became General George Washington
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:11.440]  as like you know Lucky George in those guys they say have the what do they call
[01:47:11.440 --> 01:47:16.320]  that name in history in the military the touch or they're charmed they're they
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:21.000]  call it in the military being charmed in fact that's what Ford Coppola talked
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.400]  about in in apocalypse now when you see the Army Colonel walk around with a
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.400]  helicopter's everybody's getting killed around him and mortars are going off and
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:33.040]  it's like everybody knows that guy's never gonna get killed and I'm telling you
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:35.880]  George Washington could just have like a hundred people shooting right heading
[01:47:35.880 --> 01:47:39.120]  and it would nothing would happen I'll say don't compare me to George
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:44.680]  Washington anything else the eternal archetypal spirit that's part of
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:48.680]  everyone's destiny to fulfill and it's like God reaches out and has certain
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:51.720]  protections for the people that are destined to fill those roles I mean I
[01:47:51.720 --> 01:47:55.720]  there's no simpler way to explain it but I did want to talk about something on
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:48:01.800]  topic with the with the DoD coming out about their line I actually called and
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:04.880]  talked to you right after you were on Pierce Morgan and let me tell you I was
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:09.520]  teared up live teared up when I saw you standing up for us against that hatchet
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:12.920]  man because you knew what he was people say oh he should have debated the time
[01:48:12.920 --> 01:48:15.760]  for debate is over we know what you are we know what you're gonna do we know
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:20.200]  what you're here to do and you know it's really if it was George Washington you
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:23.480]  know he would have pulled out a gun and blew his head off before the guy even
[01:48:23.480 --> 01:48:29.120]  got on his show but what I wanted to say was is that when I called you to talk
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:34.080]  about gun control I had called CNN the state-run media and you stopped me and
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:38.760]  you said that's it that's the word that we need to use for it and I want to say
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:42.960]  that's an archetype too we need to activate a very powerful archetype
[01:48:42.960 --> 01:48:47.720]  Ron Paul I actually got there from Ron Paul drudging linked to that he said
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:52.880]  look we have state-run media and the internet is the real media every it
[01:48:52.880 --> 01:48:56.720]  doesn't mean we're all perfect but we are the media they're not the mainstream
[01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:01.040]  we're not the new media we're not the alternative media we are the real
[01:49:01.040 --> 01:49:06.720]  diverse good bad ugly trustworthy whatever but we're the media we are the
[01:49:06.720 --> 01:49:11.160]  media that you're right it's state-run media and that's it it's not the parrot
[01:49:11.160 --> 01:49:15.380]  media it's not the prostitute media it's not the trader media it's not the
[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:21.160]  cess dream media it's not the decepticon media it's not the scumbag media they
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:25.640]  are reading off globalist psyops because of the army realizes it's big banks
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:28.640]  right in the real psyops they're junior to this they don't like being part of it
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:31.720]  now and I'm telling you I know the military sources they don't like what's
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:37.160]  happening who would everybody knows we're being conned cheated sold out it
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:41.360]  just makes me so angry what do you why do you have you seen our story about the
[01:49:41.360 --> 01:49:45.240]  army psyop and then admitting they're a psyop and what do you think's behind it
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:50.360]  yeah I know what it is it's state-run media model I mean when I used to read
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:53.760]  newspaper articles when I was a kid I went to private school I was taught to
[01:49:53.760 --> 01:49:57.320]  think critically and I used to read the newspaper since I was before I was ten
[01:49:57.320 --> 01:50:01.480]  and I read it all the way through growing up till right now and I'll tell you
[01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:05.440]  every time we refer to the media outside this country when when there were
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:09.480]  communists and tyranny all over the world we used to put it down and it was
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:12.720]  never called anything other than state-run media it didn't even get a
[01:50:12.720 --> 01:50:16.040]  name we didn't brand it here it was state-run media and we need to start
[01:50:16.040 --> 01:50:20.280]  calling them that over and over and over because that's what they are you
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:23.840]  absolute that will bring them down we have state-run media that works for
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:28.160]  foreign banks that have occupied the country and we are occupied and they
[01:50:28.160 --> 01:50:32.520]  haven't shut us they have occupied certain command bases and the
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:35.840]  infrastructure but they're not occupying everything that's the thing they're
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:42.400]  trying a full occupation are we gonna let them do it no the answer is no God

[01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:47.120]  any money but they'll be flown in to work with us to see about if they have
[01:54:47.120 --> 01:54:52.920]  ideas for films because that's that's really what this contest is about is
[01:54:52.920 --> 01:54:57.280]  finding out who could make a film in two months because you know talk is cheap
[01:54:57.280 --> 01:55:03.400]  out there and who wants to help us fight the new world order that's what this is
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:06.960]  really all about is I'm trying to recruit people because film is the big
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:13.360]  weapon and I'm so busy with the radio the print all the rest of it that I have
[01:55:13.360 --> 01:55:16.560]  been lacking in film production I'm trying to make Obama deception to right
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:19.600]  now while doing a hundred different things and I'm not complaining but go
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:24.640]  to info wars dot com four slash Paul to see the Paul Revere site the top 35
[01:55:24.640 --> 01:55:29.040]  entries and there's a link to about 300 others but I salute everyone who was
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:33.320]  involved and then we'll continue with your calls as well and the news I haven't
[01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:36.520]  gotten to yet but we're talking about the philosophy of this country and where
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:39.920]  is it going and when you realize that you're not gonna join evil you're not
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:43.120]  gonna join the globalist when you think about all the crimes they've committed
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:49.160]  and I could spiritually feel it as well I don't want nothing to do with these
[01:55:49.160 --> 01:55:57.200]  people and I must be against them and I must resist them so it's it's it's it's
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:05.480]  it's a compelling over-driving fulfillment that is a hundred times the
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:10.920]  drive for sex when you're 16 years old it's a hundred times the drive for food
[01:56:10.920 --> 01:56:16.400]  when you're hungry it is the drive for humanity to be good and to build and to
[01:56:16.400 --> 01:56:24.080]  be decent and to stand against corrupt scum and to not be a slave it is totally
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:31.680]  fulfilling it is all-encompassing and that's where I stand and and and and
[01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:36.920]  when you stand in that and when you stand in the presence of God's spirit then
[01:56:36.920 --> 01:56:40.840]  it makes you feel very humble and empowered but also at the same time a
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:46.000]  very very weak and dirty and bad like dirty rags as the Bible describes
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:51.640]  you know folks that were close to God they'll felt like they had dirty rags
[01:56:51.640 --> 01:56:56.000]  because you realize how bad you are and you don't like that part of you as well
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:56:59.560]  and you see other people that are into their evil and then you figure out they
[01:56:59.560 --> 01:57:03.040]  don't like you because you're not committed to all the things they do
[01:57:03.040 --> 01:57:09.080]  they like it stench smells good to them children in pain is fun for them and all
[01:57:09.080 --> 01:57:12.640]  I want to do is club their brains out and not because I like to club brains out
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:16.640]  it's a compulsion I want to get my hands around their throat you know what I'm
[01:57:16.640 --> 01:57:20.920]  talking about we're the people that are strong and we need to start acting like
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:26.840]  it and stop being weak and like a bunch of scum run our lives evil is weak but
[01:57:26.840 --> 01:57:31.720]  good likes to stand back and let it run things and that has to stop I'm gonna
[01:57:31.720 --> 01:57:34.240]  come back take some calls and we're gonna get David not here we'll get David
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:36.320]  not in at the bottom of the hours I want to continue with calls I haven't been
[01:57:36.320 --> 01:57:39.880]  good about getting to him yet I will I've done pretty good and pretty heavy

[02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:22.880]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:36.960]  Alex Jones ladies and gentlemen we've been following this Adam Kokesh has been
[02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:42.240]  calling me the famous libertarian talk show host who's gonna have the arm march
[02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:46.080]  on Washington he has now officially said I've talked to him over the phone I
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:48.600]  should have made a bigger deal out of this but I kept thinking he was gonna
[02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:52.520]  get out then we heard last week that they take him to an undisclosed location
[02:00:52.520 --> 02:00:58.160]  we're talking to his crew and now they've announced no bond for Adam Kokesh
[02:00:58.160 --> 02:01:03.960]  and I when I talked to Adam multiple times they would cut him off the phone
[02:01:03.960 --> 02:01:07.840]  he has my cell phone number he called me from prison let's not exaggerate 20
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:12.160]  times and they cut him off and then I started getting messages then we even
[02:01:12.160 --> 02:01:14.840]  tried to hook it up off my cell phone to record it and then he couldn't get back
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:20.440]  through Adam Kokesh would call in and he would call me and say they planted it
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:24.280]  they planted it I didn't have drugs so so officially he's saying they planted it
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:27.800]  and he's the type of guy the news gonna get ready why would he have even if he
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:32.680]  did have mushrooms there why would he have it and so we'll try to get an
[02:01:32.680 --> 02:01:36.440]  update on that I mean he's type of guy that would say if he did and he knew
[02:01:36.440 --> 02:01:41.320]  they were gonna be coming why would he do that so they set him up and it shows
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:45.080]  you folks a lot of people thought Adam Kokesh was like a Psyop or something no
[02:01:45.080 --> 02:01:50.560]  I don't think so I think he's pretty wound up from you know all this stuff he
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:56.120]  saw in Fallujah as a Marine and he's kind of gotten really reckless and wild I
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:02:00.800]  could only admire his courage but my gut tells me he's not some agent my gut
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:06.840]  tells me he's in deep deep deep trouble for challenging these people I mean he
[02:02:06.840 --> 02:02:10.240]  went into Mordor you know what let's get Lou Rockwell on the next few days not
[02:02:10.240 --> 02:02:13.240]  so much about Adam but just I don't want to get Lou Rockwell on up and forget to
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:18.600]  tell you to do that yeah activist Adam Kokesh ordered hell without bond in DC

[02:02:50.320 --> 02:02:54.000]  representing Adam Kokesh argued that the stunt film the post on YouTube was
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:57.640]  nothing more than political theater the judge disagreed ordering Kokesh be
[02:02:57.640 --> 02:03:00.320]  held till his next court appearance I consider your client to be a very
[02:03:00.320 --> 02:03:04.040]  dangerous man the judge said this is not a political statement it's a totally

[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:44.680]  All right ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna go back to your phone calls and more news
[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:50.640]  but right now I want to just recap what broke during the last segment Adam
[02:08:50.640 --> 02:08:58.240]  Kokesh the libertarian talk show host frequent guest on this show he got
[02:08:58.240 --> 02:09:05.960]  arrested a few weeks ago in a huge SWAT team raid in Maryland and I've since
[02:09:05.960 --> 02:09:11.640]  talked to him from a state jail in Virginia he's been transferred to the
[02:09:11.640 --> 02:09:19.200]  feds now even though it was the feds that arrested him and what happened to him
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:22.840]  he says is that they planted the mushrooms on him I mean he said they
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:25.920]  were gonna be raiding me over having the load of shotgun in DC as a
[02:09:25.920 --> 02:09:31.600]  demonstration so why would I have mushrooms there and he said they brought
[02:09:31.600 --> 02:09:36.840]  in big bags full of stuff and it was just bizarre and there's a bunch of
[02:09:36.840 --> 02:09:39.960]  witnesses I've had lawyers that were there waiting for the raid they've been
[02:09:39.960 --> 02:09:44.320]  camping out there for weeks when it happened expecting them to try something
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:48.200]  and they said they saw them bring in big big paper bags full of stuff and it
[02:09:48.200 --> 02:09:51.240]  sure wasn't that their lunch and they searched the place for over four hours
[02:09:51.240 --> 02:09:55.880]  so they found marijuana and mushrooms and in now they've announced he's being
[02:09:55.880 --> 02:10:03.080]  held without bail the feds are for being a quote very dangerous man and that it
[02:10:03.080 --> 02:10:06.360]  was not a political statement even though his lawyer argued that he said
[02:10:06.360 --> 02:10:13.400]  it's a political statement and so now he has disappeared into the federal rat hole
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:19.440]  and the superior court judge has ordered a veteran and activist accused of
[02:10:19.440 --> 02:10:23.560]  open carrying a shotgun in DC's freedom plaza held without bond during a
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:27.040]  preliminary hearing today an attorney representing Adam Kokesh argued the
[02:10:27.040 --> 02:10:31.120]  stunt filmed and posted on YouTube was nothing more than political theater the
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:35.160]  judge disagreed ordering that Kokesh be held until next court appearance I
[02:10:35.160 --> 02:10:39.040]  consider your client to be a very dangerous man the judge yeah this is not
[02:10:39.040 --> 02:10:44.200]  a political statement because she's God you can say that and it goes on he's an
[02:10:44.200 --> 02:10:49.800]  ex-expected to be seen in DC courtroom August 13th so in America a guy with no
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:54.040]  criminal record other than being arrested for dancing at the Jefferson
[02:10:54.040 --> 02:10:57.580]  monument that's not allowed well they treat you like scum in DC family's
[02:10:57.580 --> 02:11:01.440]  filming on the side of the sidewalk you can't do that what's the law I told I
[02:11:01.440 --> 02:11:05.680]  mean they want you to know your scum I mean you talk about me North Korea in
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:09.400]  that rude to people I mean it's it's pathetic been there many times the film
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:14.360]  crews you name it and thought they were signaling us out until I'd be I've told
[02:11:14.360 --> 02:11:17.000]  the story many times we got it on tape somewhere around her hundred yards 200
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:22.840]  yards from the Washington monument and first cops come over go you can't film
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:26.440]  here and you're like we're with a film crew we checked they don't give permits
[02:11:26.440 --> 02:11:32.440]  in DC plus you don't need a permit we're just here and they go alright I'll let
[02:11:32.440 --> 02:11:36.880]  you do it for five minutes you're like but there's no law and he goes I can do
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:41.560]  whatever I want a police officer's order you're like so they walk off and
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:47.280]  then security guards come over and we're way back from even the end of the ring
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:53.200]  of flags around it down the hill I was with C think one of the times that made
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:56.960]  the New World Order film they said handheld cameras they come over in the
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:00.120]  security are goes I don't care what the cops told you I'll have you at rest day
[02:12:00.120 --> 02:12:05.760]  and then you try to go even in the park across the street I'm talking 200 yards
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:10.120]  from the White House gate and secret service on bikes come over but in
[02:12:10.120 --> 02:12:14.400]  uniforms and go get out here you can't film you're like it's America they're
[02:12:14.400 --> 02:12:24.120]  like hey and and you're like and then they move on and then go to a family and
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:27.360]  the family's like and they're getting off on it there's like a family and
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:32.480]  little kids and I mean they want you to know this country's ours and there ain't
[02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:37.920]  nothing you're doing we're gonna gut it up one side and down the other I mean
[02:12:37.920 --> 02:12:42.320]  this is like Mao Zedong runs this country or something and you see him
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:46.520]  trying to charge people with you know life in prison in Illinois for filming
[02:12:46.520 --> 02:12:49.840]  the police because they're hauling off cars from their junkyard that they've
[02:12:49.840 --> 02:12:54.040]  owned for you know 50-something years and they've got classic cars worth massive
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:57.320]  amounts of money and then when the judge finally said I'm gonna throw this
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:13:02.800]  out of court they sent the state down with a special amicus briefing we want
[02:13:02.800 --> 02:13:11.600]  this guy in doubt and we want people in jail for life for filming for life you
[02:13:11.600 --> 02:13:16.640]  get a lot I mean folks this is just North Korea if they have their way and it
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:32.840]  makes me physically it is absolutely incredible absolutely incredible that
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:39.800]  that this type of stuff is going on that that a slave with a shotgun loading it
[02:13:39.800 --> 02:13:43.480]  and saying I'm not a slave Rosa Parks sitting at the front of the bus I'm not
[02:13:43.480 --> 02:13:57.280]  sitting at the back of the bus that that's so freaked out the system that so
[02:13:57.280 --> 02:14:02.680]  freaked out the system that they're holding him without bond it just shows
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:07.040]  the incredible tyrants these people are because the ultimate crime is a slave
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:12.480]  that's armed Brandon and Georgia you're on the air go ahead hey Alex thanks for
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:16.200]  taking my call thanks for calling brother hey no prior I was gonna talk about
[02:14:16.200 --> 02:14:19.880]  eugenics but I had another point too since you started talking about people
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:23.680]  getting arrested so easily I live and have a job that's right in the heart of
[02:14:23.680 --> 02:14:27.480]  the city and I don't know if this is a pattern around with other major cities
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:33.240]  or not but I won't mention any names but we've got we've got a judge here in
[02:14:33.240 --> 02:14:37.800]  town who profits off of these low-level dealers and has a male prostitution
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:43.880]  ring this is not speculation this is not inference this fact and so a lot of the
[02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:48.120]  beat cops have kind of evolved to where when they bust somebody they always say
[02:14:48.120 --> 02:14:51.760]  look we've got to find a felony here because if we don't these guys are gonna
[02:14:51.760 --> 02:14:55.360]  get right back down and start making a profit for this judge you have you've
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:14:58.280]  noticed a pattern like this where where some of the higher-ups are making a
[02:14:58.280 --> 02:15:04.280]  profit off of offer crime like this and some of the bigger cities well here's
[02:15:04.280 --> 02:15:10.400]  the deal you've either got cities that have resisted criminal takeover and or
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:13.640]  have kicked criminal governments out before and I'd say that's maybe a third
[02:15:13.640 --> 02:15:17.800]  of the cities and towns a rough estimation depends on the region that
[02:15:17.800 --> 02:15:22.160]  aren't mafia right and those are generally nice places where everybody
[02:15:22.160 --> 02:15:25.840]  wants to move in their prosperous but you also have areas where the criminals
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:30.200]  have taken over where it's already such a big town or city that they just feel
[02:15:30.200 --> 02:15:34.800]  everybody but didn't they usually go so far they get caught because you know
[02:15:34.800 --> 02:15:38.360]  their son gets caught with a kilo of cocaine and kill somebody and then it
[02:15:38.360 --> 02:15:43.520]  all comes out and so that police chief or that mayor steps down so that it kind
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:48.280]  of goes away but the dealing starts I mean where I live in Texas about half
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:15:52.800]  the sheriffs in the counties on average about half the counties have had
[02:15:52.800 --> 02:15:59.800]  sheriffs arrested running drugs running prostitutes they're also caught running
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:02.720]  pedophile rings all the time but that doesn't mean that all the sheriffs are
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:06.600]  pedophiles you'll have a sheriff right next door that's so simple-minded and
[02:16:06.600 --> 02:16:10.480]  and gullible that they don't even know what's happening but yes normally it's
[02:16:10.480 --> 02:16:16.880]  the police that run the hooker operations in big cities LA New York you
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:22.240]  big cities the police as middlemen for the big banks the big banks ship the
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:27.400]  drugs in all of it and then the wrong lot of the money and then any drugs that
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:30.920]  are shipped in that they don't control they send the police that to go shut down
[02:16:30.920 --> 02:16:34.640]  their competition of course the beat cops are out just writing tickets and
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:38.600]  raising money or responding to burglar alarms but it's the special narcotics
[02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:42.120]  units and you know it's always the prostitution unit that turns out's
[02:16:42.120 --> 02:16:46.840]  running the horse because they want to also you know take a bite out of the
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:50.600]  prostitutes like a bite out of crime that they want to they want to dabble in
[02:16:50.600 --> 02:16:55.440]  in that and you know all the runaways and 16 year olds coming off the coming
[02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:59.160]  off the buses and all of it and you know these a lot of these a lot of these
[02:16:59.160 --> 02:17:03.120]  narcotics detectives you know they got a busy day having sex five six times and
[02:17:03.120 --> 02:17:07.240]  snorting cocaine themselves and injecting heroin and beating people up
[02:17:07.240 --> 02:17:10.560]  and I mean you see them they're just hardcore criminals they run America and
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:15.320]  that's that's how it is and you know they've got your daughter right now you
[02:17:15.320 --> 02:17:20.960]  know you know in a hotel and the and the hotel gives them free hotel rooms too
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:25.120]  because if they don't they'll they'll take the hotel for drug dealing I mean
[02:17:25.120 --> 02:17:29.120]  that's how this works and so yeah I suggest you can probably get killed doing
[02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:33.840]  it but if you want to fight them go in with a wire go into bars get people
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:38.960]  talking about it talk to the hookers do your own citizen sting I'm not
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:42.320]  recommending you do this you get killed those this kind of thing I would do you
[02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:45.560]  would go get the hooker in there don't have sex with her get it all recorded
[02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:50.280]  who she works for don't do it is put it directly up to YouTube just directly up
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:54.520]  with a report who did it who they are it'll destroy them by the time it gets
[02:17:54.520 --> 02:17:57.600]  copied put everywhere it's over you just burn them down that way I call it
[02:17:57.600 --> 02:18:01.800]  burning them down and or you can go to their office and say hey I've got all
[02:18:01.800 --> 02:18:04.960]  the interviews with the hookers and the stuff you're running what are you gonna
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:09.720]  do about that what are you gonna do about that and then they'll offer to buy
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:13.760]  you off or threaten you you'll go already have it already in another city
[02:18:13.760 --> 02:18:17.440]  ready to be uploaded then they'll start trying to offer to buy you out the FBI
[02:18:17.440 --> 02:18:20.720]  is not gonna help you generally they're on the take so all you can do is
[02:18:20.720 --> 02:18:24.200]  publicly burn them down then say all right well you know they'll offer you a
[02:18:24.200 --> 02:18:27.960]  bribe is there we'll talk about it they mills they may still flip out and have
[02:18:27.960 --> 02:18:32.720]  the cops kill you as you drive away from the police station or the city council
[02:18:32.720 --> 02:18:36.720]  building the other mayor's office so you better have people with you I'm telling
[02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:39.680]  you it's dangerous I mean they may just still kill you anyways and who cares if
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:43.040]  it gets uploaded and then you just upload the fact that they're running the
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:47.240]  horse locally and it greatly usually be underage ones too because things are so
[02:18:47.240 --> 02:18:51.080]  corrupt now most these people don't want a 25-year-old prostitute they want a
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:55.840]  15-year-old one and so you I mean that's why you can walk into acorn offices in
[02:18:55.840 --> 02:18:59.040]  those famous videos office after office going here's my underage hooker I'm
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:02.080]  gonna bring in little kids are like well let us let us sign you up oh yeah we
[02:19:02.080 --> 02:19:06.200]  love that I mean that's just America that's what America is you got one half
[02:19:06.200 --> 02:19:09.800]  is pure evil and the other half doesn't know what side of the planet they're on
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:12.640]  and doesn't know they're you know head from home the ground that's an over
[02:19:12.640 --> 02:19:17.320]  generalization when I say one half of either the awake you know of the group
[02:19:17.320 --> 02:19:20.760]  doing nothing half of them are evil and know what's going on and the other half
[02:19:20.760 --> 02:19:24.880]  don't are so stupid and so naive they don't care and then you've probably
[02:19:24.880 --> 02:19:30.280]  got 35 40% of the population that's awake so you got like 70% that's either
[02:19:30.280 --> 02:19:36.040]  totally dumb or in on the evil and 30% or so that are good and awake but either
[02:19:36.040 --> 02:19:40.040]  aren't taking action because they feel powerless or caught up in infighting and
[02:19:40.040 --> 02:19:45.800]  cognitive infiltration so I mean does that answer your question certain it does
[02:19:45.800 --> 02:19:49.480]  I hear the music do I have time to ask sure sure sure we'll come back to you

[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:49.920]  rather live as slaves the minute men are turning in their graves what's
[02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:55.520]  happened to our heritage what's happened to our pride since when the free
[02:24:55.520 --> 02:25:02.880]  Americans pulled for the other side did we send food to Hitler troops or
[02:25:02.880 --> 02:25:11.720]  praise the enemy did all our children die in vain depending liberty the minute
[02:25:11.720 --> 02:25:18.800]  men are turning in their graves Washington and Jefferson are crying
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:25.840]  tears of shame that's Stonewall Jackson these men would rather live as slaves
[02:25:25.840 --> 02:25:30.360]  the minute men are turning in their graves see a lot of people back in the
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:34.800]  50s and 60s they would say do whatever the government says in a war that's
[02:25:34.800 --> 02:25:43.120]  fighting for America they didn't know that that was a sigh up as well but I
[02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:50.320]  fail to understand the man that won't defend his home dear Lord I've got one
[02:25:50.320 --> 02:25:56.840]  little prayer I pray years to come don't ever let those kind of people serve in

[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:06.840]  that's also the sigh up the globalists create the war they then create the
[02:26:06.840 --> 02:26:13.120]  opposition to the war as the new political class who they actually put in
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:20.120]  who become even bigger warmongers and who then wage war against America itself
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:26.000]  and so what's happening is the people at the Pentagon now really are coming to
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:32.720]  face-to-face that they're the bad guys I saw a skit I forget what it was I was
[02:26:32.720 --> 02:26:35.880]  one of the comedy shows on TV but I saw the clip on YouTube and it shows
[02:26:35.880 --> 02:26:41.480]  German Shultz soldiers on the Eastern Front and they're going you know we're
[02:26:41.480 --> 02:26:46.960]  wearing black uniforms and skulls on our hats that's what the bad guys wear you
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:49.560]  know I would think like guys in black wearing skulls that's like the bad guys
[02:26:49.560 --> 02:26:53.560]  that guy goes you know you are actually right that is kind of how the bad guys
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:57.800]  dress I mean now look at even how the new order acts they are the bad guy the
[02:26:57.800 --> 02:27:05.040]  country's a homeland homeland is there to absorb the old Republic homeland is a
[02:27:05.040 --> 02:27:11.800]  fascist or communist term it's just they're even going with the archetypal
[02:27:11.800 --> 02:27:16.600]  script to try to condition us to just accept anything they want to do the
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:19.680]  military people aren't bad on average they're some of the most awake folks
[02:27:19.680 --> 02:27:24.240]  it's the people running it I know I beat that horse to death folks let's go to
[02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:29.480]  the fellow I was talking to was that Brandon in Georgia yeah Brandon look I
[02:27:29.480 --> 02:27:32.920]  don't know about your town I don't know about what your mayors and people are up
[02:27:32.920 --> 02:27:35.120]  to I don't know their names I don't want to hear them I don't want to have
[02:27:35.120 --> 02:27:42.160]  unsustainable stuff on air I just know this I would say more than half the
[02:27:42.160 --> 02:27:47.600]  cities and and cities and and and counties and county seats are criminal
[02:27:47.600 --> 02:27:51.080]  operations I mean you'll have a lot of people working compartmentalized who
[02:27:51.080 --> 02:27:57.040]  aren't aware of it but but but generally yes and then and there's another
[02:27:57.040 --> 02:28:00.280]  reason they've had the Pentagon come in and federalized local departments and
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:05.000]  things because that's so the government can control that centrally as well and
[02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:09.520]  that's why our government seems so mafioso is because it is run by big
[02:28:09.520 --> 02:28:14.360]  banks that are the ultimate mafia and so this is government by corporate
[02:28:14.360 --> 02:28:19.280]  mafias that are above the law what was your last question I was concerning
[02:28:19.280 --> 02:28:23.240]  eugenics and maybe you can like me maybe there's a better word for what I'm
[02:28:23.240 --> 02:28:27.200]  about to talk about but I'll prep that what I'm totally against abortion I
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:30.840]  think it's a moot point as far as whether or not consciousness is there the
[02:28:30.840 --> 02:28:34.800]  fact that we don't know should suspend all abortion and kill babies up to age
[02:28:34.800 --> 02:28:41.440]  three I hear this now they're saying old people don't have a good life even if
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:44.960]  they're conscious and awake and the bioethics board decides to kill you
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:48.160]  because they decide your life's not worth living that's all they're doing
[02:28:48.160 --> 02:28:51.800]  tomatons like the ones on the video on your site that are just signing anything
[02:28:51.800 --> 02:28:54.640]  without even knowing what's on there and here in the word fourth trimester they'll
[02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:58.840]  sign it anyway yeah what you mean it's killing a three month old baby up exactly
[02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:03.440]  exactly but as far as eugenics goes um you know when I see things and I see
[02:29:03.440 --> 02:29:07.760]  people that have been convicted over and over for child abuse, pedophilia these
[02:29:07.760 --> 02:29:12.400]  types of things and do you not think why not why not sterilize them exactly but
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:16.480]  see that's the road to hell's paved with good intentions because the minute you
[02:29:16.480 --> 02:29:20.760]  start doing that you should just execute them rather than do that because let me
[02:29:20.760 --> 02:29:26.000]  tell you it's going to start being used against everybody they don't want some
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:31.760]  kid in a crib that's five and weighs 25 pounds with maggots all over them they
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:35.600]  want your healthy happy kid that's living great to hand it off to a rich
[02:29:35.600 --> 02:29:39.600]  family because they want to do satanic rituals with it let me tell you a lot
[02:29:39.600 --> 02:29:43.600]  of your cps are outright devil worshipers okay I've dealt with them they
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:49.240]  worship Satan they want to rape your kid okay period I'm just just face it
[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:52.000]  we'll be right back

[02:33:21.480 --> 02:33:36.240]  all right folks I have been ranting and raving today I've absolutely got to get
[02:33:36.240 --> 02:33:39.920]  to some of the financial news and Middle East news some of the other stuff
[02:33:39.920 --> 02:33:43.600]  that's up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com but I wanted to get
[02:33:43.600 --> 02:33:48.280]  into the Paul Revere contest and it's been a huge success with David Knight
[02:33:48.280 --> 02:33:51.760]  but first David I've got to ask you and I think I'll do this tomorrow with
[02:33:51.760 --> 02:33:56.600]  listeners a specific question to listeners what do they think of the
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:34:01.400]  Pentagon coming out in a major deputy secretary of defense head of public
[02:34:01.400 --> 02:34:06.560]  relations dod saying we've been lying to the public a lot we've been caught these
[02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:11.480]  are quotes we're going to stop now and everybody's freaking out people have
[02:34:11.480 --> 02:34:14.480]  tears in their eyes if you watch the video the body language people get them
[02:34:14.480 --> 02:34:18.160]  say I don't want to lie I hope this is the truth I mean this this was not a psi
[02:34:18.160 --> 02:34:22.520]  op they may have authorized it because it's some psi up to say we're gonna tell
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:26.800]  the truth now trust us but I know the people that are really revolting are
[02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:30.280]  in the Pentagon they know that their experts in this they know this is
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:33.320]  authoritarianism everything they were trained to fight just 50 years ago
[02:34:33.320 --> 02:34:39.240]  they're like wow so I see it as a huge moment where there's a debate going on
[02:34:39.240 --> 02:34:46.640]  and almost the system begging you know for people to you know aid them and then
[02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:51.120]  meanwhile you've got the propaganda intensifying on CNN MSNBC just a hundred
[02:34:51.120 --> 02:34:58.480]  and ten percent authoritarian trash what is your take on that David Knight well
[02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:02.800]  the same time they're doing that they've also got people talking about how they're
[02:35:02.800 --> 02:35:06.840]  repealing a prohibition that's been in place since after the after World War
[02:35:06.840 --> 02:35:10.320]  two all through the Cold War they're repealing a prohibition against
[02:35:10.320 --> 02:35:14.240]  broadcasting propaganda type news domestically in the United States like
[02:35:14.240 --> 02:35:17.800]  with Radio Free Europe and that sort of thing Voice of America they're repealing
[02:35:17.800 --> 02:35:21.120]  that at the same time so they're stepping up the info war in both directions so
[02:35:21.120 --> 02:35:23.880]  you got people that are good on the inside that are aware of what's going on
[02:35:23.880 --> 02:35:27.520]  and are pushing back on it but then you've also got government working to
[02:35:27.520 --> 02:35:31.200]  actively propagandize internally in the United States just like they're bringing
[02:35:31.200 --> 02:35:35.820]  home the militarization you know and what they've been doing in in various
[02:35:35.820 --> 02:35:38.560]  foreign cities that's right they've helped set up the New World Order and now
[02:35:38.560 --> 02:35:43.560]  it's collapsing I agree and this is a scyop on those people to allow them to do
[02:35:43.560 --> 02:35:47.320]  that is like we're the good guys we're going to stop lying now that it's going
[02:35:47.320 --> 02:35:50.840]  to be against Americans and that's why most the guys look totally freaked out
[02:35:50.840 --> 02:35:54.720]  and depressed because they realize what it was I agree with you absolutely yeah
[02:35:54.720 --> 02:35:57.440]  it remains to be seen what's going to happen I mean you've still got both
[02:35:57.440 --> 02:36:00.960]  elements are active there so there's going to be they're stepping up the
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:03.560]  information propaganda war here domestically they've been doing but it
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:07.280]  shows they're desperate it shows their because in a way they are telling the
[02:36:07.280 --> 02:36:10.760]  truth okay we're just going to admit we're propagandizing and we'll we're
[02:36:10.760 --> 02:36:14.520]  spying on you and we'll secret arrest you see we're all we're honest now right
[02:36:14.520 --> 02:36:17.800]  they've been doing that physical type of stuff the anti-insurrection type of
[02:36:17.800 --> 02:36:21.240]  things have been doing that in Iraq and Afghanistan they've been training they're
[02:36:21.240 --> 02:36:24.960]  bringing that back home but another crucial part of that is of course the
[02:36:24.960 --> 02:36:29.600]  information war you have to realize that in Iraq and Afghanistan they are also
[02:36:29.600 --> 02:36:33.280]  doing an information war there they're actively propagandizing the people
[02:36:33.280 --> 02:36:37.240]  there now they're openly declaring with the repeal of this law that's been in
[02:36:37.240 --> 02:36:41.480]  place since right after the world after World War two they're giving us
[02:36:41.480 --> 02:36:45.480]  notice that they're bringing that back to me but as we know you watch any sitcom
[02:36:45.480 --> 02:36:49.440]  drama you name it we're getting what the new older stands for that's all
[02:36:49.440 --> 02:36:53.400]  admittedly paid for already I mean they spent billions on no child left behind
[02:36:53.400 --> 02:36:57.280]  in fake newscast billions I forget they I think was like three four billion or
[02:36:57.280 --> 02:37:01.720]  something or maybe more just on one program 200,000 of this talk show host
[02:37:01.720 --> 02:37:04.960]  you know half million to that writer I mean a lot of this is going to be open
[02:37:04.960 --> 02:37:09.560]  buying media off well a little bit of truth goes a long way against big lies
[02:37:09.560 --> 02:37:12.920]  and so and that's really what this operation Paul Revere is about it's
[02:37:12.920 --> 02:37:17.200]  like broadening this out getting a broader base letting people wake each
[02:37:17.200 --> 02:37:20.860]  no one complaining worse I ops can argue with this we just said here's the
[02:37:20.860 --> 02:37:25.280]  contest totally organic it's incredible yeah and it's a huge contest I mean
[02:37:25.280 --> 02:37:30.480]  General Electric took one year to get people to do three-minute entries about
[02:37:30.480 --> 02:37:34.560]  their topic and they had a big prize of $100,000 that's huge for video contest
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:39.440]  many times you have video contest where the top prize is $1,000 $5,000 a big one
[02:37:39.440 --> 02:37:45.800]  will be $10,000 when you go to $100,000 first place prize that's huge yeah
[02:37:45.800 --> 02:37:50.600]  because we've done 10,000 5,000 15,000 before and those were huge yeah and I
[02:37:50.600 --> 02:37:53.200]  want to say to the people that are disappointed because you know we've
[02:37:53.200 --> 02:37:57.200]  had over 600 entries we're gonna have over 597 people that are gonna be
[02:37:57.200 --> 02:38:00.000]  disappointed probably even gonna have the third place and second place guys a
[02:38:00.000 --> 02:38:03.040]  little bit disappointed they didn't win the first praise place prize but you
[02:38:03.040 --> 02:38:07.040]  know I didn't win prizes that I entered here at Info Wars Darren McBreen
[02:38:07.040 --> 02:38:10.760]  didn't Josh didn't I mean we all are working here now because that's another
[02:38:10.760 --> 02:38:14.360]  part of this contest is trying to identify talent that's gonna work with
[02:38:14.360 --> 02:38:19.920]  that's right we had a reporter contest but the the main backbones of this place
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:24.280]  now are the people that actually lost because it's about getting to know you
[02:38:24.280 --> 02:38:28.440]  right absolutely and I also have to say to the people who are doing this just
[02:38:28.440 --> 02:38:32.800]  because you're not chosen in a contest I was in a lot of video contests and I
[02:38:32.800 --> 02:38:35.640]  just for Info Wars but other ones and you have to understand it's not about
[02:38:35.640 --> 02:38:39.440]  your work don't take it personally some of my best work didn't win some of my
[02:38:39.440 --> 02:38:43.640]  worst entries did win it's really what people are looking for and that's a
[02:38:43.640 --> 02:38:47.800]  very difficult thing to ascertain when you don't have any feedback you get
[02:38:47.800 --> 02:38:50.320]  some guidelines you kind of know what the topics they are that they're looking
[02:38:50.320 --> 02:38:54.000]  for but unlike a situation where you actually producing a film in-house you
[02:38:54.000 --> 02:38:58.720]  can't get feedback well sure sure but I also want to focus everybody's a winner
[02:38:58.720 --> 02:39:03.160]  this is about fighting the New World Order right this is not about we did the
[02:39:03.160 --> 02:39:07.520]  hundred fifteen thousand dollars in prizes to to to instead of having
[02:39:07.520 --> 02:39:11.480]  billions of government funding for the arts to push evil agendas let's see what
[02:39:11.480 --> 02:39:14.240]  hundred fifteen thousand dollars of Liberty money could do and it's already
[02:39:14.240 --> 02:39:17.560]  reached millions of people that's right and then the real phase is to see who
[02:39:17.560 --> 02:39:21.120]  could follow direction and in two months do something incredible and that's and
[02:39:21.120 --> 02:39:24.440]  that's a big part of it just in a couple of months we got some really
[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:28.160]  outstanding production values from several entries is very difficult to
[02:39:28.160 --> 02:39:30.720]  narrow this down very so it's about fighting the New World Order getting
[02:39:30.720 --> 02:39:36.640]  people to take action and then also finding people to work with in a film
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:39.440]  making division that I hope to find but that means people need to support us
[02:39:39.440 --> 02:39:43.680]  financially I mean this is a place where literally well this year it's been a
[02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:46.200]  hundred percent of the money we make goes into the operation usually it's like
[02:39:46.200 --> 02:39:51.000]  96 97% I mean I am just committed folks that what I want is to beat the New
[02:39:51.000 --> 02:39:55.200]  World Order so by the books by the videos by the beyond Tangier in infowars
[02:39:55.200 --> 02:39:59.000]  health.com now plus we only promote the best products anyways buy from the good
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:03.560]  guys we need your support now I also today's third place tomorrow's second
[02:40:03.560 --> 02:40:08.200]  place Wednesday's first place but I want to showcase a few of the other things
[02:40:08.200 --> 02:40:12.320]  as well so David let's start getting into it yeah we've got an entry here now
[02:40:12.320 --> 02:40:15.520]  now this one doesn't have high production values it was just a lot of fun we
[02:40:15.520 --> 02:40:20.040]  thought it was a clever take on it we did have a lot of documentaries about GMO
[02:40:20.040 --> 02:40:24.280]  and chemtrailing and that sort of thing and we had one that we featured that the
[02:40:24.280 --> 02:40:27.960]  guy actually did a documentary in an app it's called look up is called the
[02:40:27.960 --> 02:40:32.400]  documentary and the app was a Skyder alert and it's a way that people can
[02:40:32.400 --> 02:40:36.560]  create a network and report where they're seeing these chemtrails being put up
[02:40:36.560 --> 02:40:40.320]  or persistent contrails and they can send that to representatives that's a
[02:40:40.320 --> 02:40:43.560]  great piece that's that's come out of this been associated with us we've
[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:48.480]  covered that a lot of times this one however is a parody this is indoor
[02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:52.800]  chemtrailer by all seeing eyed network that's our YouTube handle all right let's
[02:40:52.800 --> 02:40:55.960]  go ahead play club that have you ever wanted to enjoy the chemtrails but
[02:40:55.960 --> 02:40:59.400]  didn't want to have to go outside what if I told you there was a product that
[02:40:59.400 --> 02:41:03.480]  would allow you to enjoy the chemtrails from inside your own home hi director of
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:07.440]  technology at the Pentagon and I'm here to tell you about the indoor chemtrailer
[02:41:07.440 --> 02:41:11.840]  after wasting billions of tax dollars spraying chemtrails in the skies the
[02:41:11.840 --> 02:41:15.120]  Pentagon realized not enough people go outdoors anymore that's when they came
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:18.640]  up with the idea for the indoor chemtrailer that takes the chemtrails
[02:41:18.640 --> 02:41:22.360]  out of the skies and puts them into your home but don't take my word for it
[02:41:22.360 --> 02:41:49.000]  check out this demonstration and the best part is it's jam-packed four nanobots
[02:41:49.000 --> 02:41:52.800]  that are gonna get into your lungs in your bloodstream and start hacking away at
[02:41:52.800 --> 02:41:59.280]  your cell walls because film is the main form of communication now in the
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:02.920]  resistance everybody's got to get in on it that's right that's right and there's
[02:42:02.920 --> 02:42:05.680]  some little inside jokes and that like you know the 800 number you call has
[02:42:05.680 --> 02:42:09.120]  got the number 322 which you know as associate was going bone yeah so he's
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:12.600]  got a lot of little inside things there now the next one we've got is a very
[02:42:12.600 --> 02:42:16.180]  serious entry and this is from a filmmaker out of Michigan it's Huron
[02:42:16.180 --> 02:42:20.680]  Films and his name I apologize if I'm mispronouncing this is Istban Latong
[02:42:20.680 --> 02:42:25.880]  and it's called a dream revered it's excellent here it is I hired in the
[02:42:25.880 --> 02:42:30.600]  General Motors Hydromatic Division in 1978 it was a good job I liked the work
[02:42:30.600 --> 02:42:34.640]  and the pay was good with benefits but soon after the auto industry started
[02:42:34.640 --> 02:42:38.760]  having problems hiring stopped and gradually the plant started downsizing
[02:42:38.760 --> 02:42:43.840]  and closing I'd like to direct my question to Mr. Perot what will you do as
[02:42:43.840 --> 02:42:48.400]  president to open foreign markets to fair competition from American business
[02:42:48.400 --> 02:42:54.280]  we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after
[02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:58.160]  you've served for a while you cash in to come a foreign lobbyist make $30,000 a
[02:42:58.160 --> 02:43:04.160]  month we have got to stop sending jobs overseas to those of you in the
[02:43:04.160 --> 02:43:09.640]  audience who are business people pretty simple if you're paying $12, $13, $14
[02:43:09.640 --> 02:43:13.960]  an hour for factory workers and you can move your factory south for border pay a
[02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:17.320]  dollar an hour for labor hire a young 25 that's assumed you've been in business
[02:43:17.320 --> 02:43:20.680]  for a long time we've got a mature work for it pay a dollar an hour for your
[02:43:20.680 --> 02:43:25.360]  labor have no health care that's the most expensive single element making a
[02:43:25.360 --> 02:43:31.840]  cost have no environmental controls no pollution controls and no retirement and
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:35.960]  you don't care about anything that making money there will be a job sucking
[02:43:35.960 --> 02:43:41.440]  sound going south it breaks my heart to see those jobs gone my children would
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:46.120]  have benefited from them it's very sad for all our children the apathy in the
[02:43:46.120 --> 02:43:50.840]  plants as this one on was pitiful but having a front row seat I learned a few
[02:43:50.840 --> 02:43:56.400]  things what I learned is best understood seeing the result first this is
[02:43:56.400 --> 02:44:01.280]  Detroit once proudly known as the Motor City now in ruin factories and
[02:44:01.280 --> 02:44:05.720]  businesses gone homes repossessed neighborhoods and shambles here is the
[02:44:05.720 --> 02:44:09.560]  result of a treaty and international finance empowered by tyrannical
[02:44:09.560 --> 02:44:16.920]  government take a good look it's what's in store for you why is the government
[02:44:16.920 --> 02:44:22.040]  so concerned about us when did our ideas become dangerous who lot are good
[02:44:22.040 --> 02:44:26.640]  jobs to be lost to slave labor and no environmental laws and foreign lands and
[02:44:26.640 --> 02:44:31.400]  who brought us into illegal foreign wars with people who posed America no threat
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:34.840]  and then that's a few clips from a dream revere it's even more powerful for
[02:44:34.840 --> 02:44:38.960]  radio listeners if you go watch it the full films at info wars.com forward
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:43.720]  slash Paul obviously for Paul revere I want to just say we debated a lot whether
[02:44:43.720 --> 02:44:48.600]  this would be fourth place or third place and this is actually what we're
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:55.440]  looking for in filmmaking okay so so if I had the money I would just make you you
[02:44:55.440 --> 02:44:59.120]  know you pay out to number threes we almost had to flip a coin on this but
[02:44:59.120 --> 02:45:02.480]  more people thought it would be the next one that is the third place winner I
[02:45:02.480 --> 02:45:06.520]  think by one vote I'll let the office all watch these than vote and then I made
[02:45:06.520 --> 02:45:11.360]  the final decision and then even I'm doubting even now but but you know the
[02:45:11.360 --> 02:45:14.080]  issue is this is the kind of people we want to work with go see the full film
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:17.840]  dream revered but they expose the globalist they fight the new world order
[02:45:17.840 --> 02:45:22.400]  they expose the off-shoring and outsourcing of jobs and so I can say
[02:45:22.400 --> 02:45:26.120]  dream revered is the honorable mention really fourth place and without further
[02:45:26.120 --> 02:45:31.000]  ado the third place winner David Knight that barely did they did a great job as
[02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:33.760]  well so I think the reason we're giving this the win is it probably a little more
[02:45:33.760 --> 02:45:37.800]  work went into it and it's also we needed we need something to be funny yeah
[02:45:37.800 --> 02:45:42.560]  exactly that's the thing it's a difference and and and we had a great
[02:45:42.560 --> 02:45:46.760]  film dream revered was great film work and this is very well done as well and
[02:45:46.760 --> 02:45:51.800]  it's a great satire and you know it's very effective to use comedy and satire
[02:45:51.800 --> 02:45:55.600]  and political cartoons and so this is an animated political cartoon that makes a
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:46:00.320]  lot of points and it's political earth political earth this is earth by
[02:46:00.320 --> 02:46:03.640]  scooter downy and the brobarian brothers and they win five thousand dollars
[02:46:03.640 --> 02:46:06.840]  that's right so we're going to get them on the show the next few days via skype
[02:46:06.840 --> 02:46:10.640]  and then we need to obviously mail them their check and then also probably
[02:46:10.640 --> 02:46:13.800]  flying out here to talk about doing work with us in the future either from
[02:46:13.800 --> 02:46:17.240]  where they're at or or actually here with us in the future it's all a big
[02:46:17.240 --> 02:46:22.240]  think-tank and so your third place here's a clip of that
[02:46:22.240 --> 02:46:30.240]  Hello! I'm the voice of reason, political animal expert, adrenaline junkie
[02:46:30.240 --> 02:46:34.240]  and again I'm going to narrate a little bit of this for radio audience
[02:46:34.240 --> 02:46:38.240]  he's like a nature you know going on animal planet
[02:46:38.240 --> 02:46:44.400]  showing with the allegory of animals how the political stuff works divide and
[02:46:44.400 --> 02:46:50.400]  conquer manipulation
[02:46:50.400 --> 02:47:02.400]  dive down into the virtual underground to explore the internet
[02:47:02.400 --> 02:47:05.400]  surveillance cameras a bat
[02:47:05.400 --> 02:47:08.400]  describe your email
[02:47:08.400 --> 02:47:14.400]  the despots these cyber caves remain the least explored places on political earth
[02:47:14.400 --> 02:47:17.400]  they're exposing the whole NSA command basis underground
[02:47:17.400 --> 02:47:22.400]  planet's last surviving schools of free thought
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:25.400]  watch out for false flags
[02:47:25.400 --> 02:47:30.400]  into the heights of higher education
[02:47:30.400 --> 02:47:35.400]  where the next generation of intellectual giants are saddled with loans
[02:47:35.400 --> 02:47:38.400]  and worthless degrees
[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:40.400]  up here!
[02:47:40.400 --> 02:47:49.400]  left-wing academics form together into destructive ideological flocks
[02:47:49.400 --> 02:47:57.400]  their pupils try to escape without being indoctrinated
[02:47:57.400 --> 02:48:00.400]  baby owl or is that a baby duck jumps out of the tree
[02:48:00.400 --> 02:48:04.400]  oh look at it
[02:48:04.400 --> 02:48:08.400]  it's so way down all the books
[02:48:08.400 --> 02:48:11.400]  student aid
[02:48:11.400 --> 02:48:14.400]  and head into the financial wilderness
[02:48:14.400 --> 02:48:18.400]  the den of thieves
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:20.400]  the bankers
[02:48:20.400 --> 02:48:27.400]  where the fat cats of wall street and their predatory loans
[02:48:27.400 --> 02:48:31.400]  strip weld from the bone of the average
[02:48:31.400 --> 02:48:38.400]  yeah we'll learn that the masses cannot cross the megabanks and the river of toxic assets
[02:48:38.400 --> 02:48:41.400]  alligators crocodiles
[02:48:41.400 --> 02:48:43.400]  oh the film will serve
[02:48:43.400 --> 02:48:47.400]  oh man this is good
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:51.400]  it's simply too big to fail
[02:48:51.400 --> 02:48:54.400]  now I'm thinking this is second place but I've already said third place
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:56.400]  it's really hard
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:00.400]  we want to work with these folks as well
[02:49:00.400 --> 02:49:05.400]  I just hope I have the money to organize it all
[02:49:05.400 --> 02:49:08.400]  now they scale the mountains of rivetive fraud
[02:49:08.400 --> 02:49:10.400]  these cliffs are so large
[02:49:10.400 --> 02:49:15.400]  they're clearly visible from space
[02:49:15.400 --> 02:49:17.400]  very very rich with visual allegories
[02:49:17.400 --> 02:49:20.400]  you know for radio you can't really take it all in
[02:49:20.400 --> 02:49:23.400]  he's got left-wing academics that are owls and cap and gowns
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:25.400]  and they've only got one wing and the other is unharmed
[02:49:25.400 --> 02:49:30.400]  so it kind of pulls it back and you see written out brainwashed
[02:49:30.400 --> 02:49:32.400]  as the birds are flying along
[02:49:32.400 --> 02:49:34.400]  he's got that last thing there was crock of fraud
[02:49:34.400 --> 02:49:36.400]  which was a giant crocodile
[02:49:36.400 --> 02:49:40.400]  that ate the people that were trying to go through the toxic assets pond
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:42.400]  and said it was too big to fail
[02:49:42.400 --> 02:49:44.400]  so he's got a lot of rich allegories in it
[02:49:44.400 --> 02:49:46.400]  it's a lot of fun
[02:49:46.400 --> 02:49:50.400]  and political cartoons have always been a very effective way to get the message
[02:49:50.400 --> 02:49:53.400]  every time I watch one of these though I think it's like first place
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:56.400]  it's like so hard because they're all so good
[02:49:56.400 --> 02:49:59.400]  so we keep going back and we keep watching these things over and over and over again
[02:49:59.400 --> 02:50:01.400]  yeah I'm ready for the contest to be over
[02:50:01.400 --> 02:50:05.400]  it's been a bigger drain on our resources and time than I thought it would be
[02:50:05.400 --> 02:50:08.400]  and you offered to spearhead it
[02:50:08.400 --> 02:50:11.400]  so I really appreciate the hard work you've done David
[02:50:11.400 --> 02:50:14.400]  tomorrow we're going to have second place announced
[02:50:14.400 --> 02:50:17.400]  yes and we'll be playing a couple more too
[02:50:17.400 --> 02:50:20.400]  and we're going to be showcasing on the nightly news
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:24.400]  on the radio, your work folks, the top 35 and others
[02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:26.400]  for the next year
[02:50:26.400 --> 02:50:29.400]  I mean we're going to make sure all these get hundreds of thousands of views
[02:50:29.400 --> 02:50:30.400]  and many of them millions
[02:50:30.400 --> 02:50:32.400]  we have an interview tonight on the nightly news
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:35.400]  with one of the filmmakers who submitted something late
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:37.400]  so we have it up as an honorable mention
[02:50:37.400 --> 02:50:39.400]  and it's about child protective services
[02:50:39.400 --> 02:50:41.400]  it's a must-see film
[02:50:41.400 --> 02:50:43.400]  tell the folks the name of that
[02:50:43.400 --> 02:50:44.400]  Uncle Sam's Kids
[02:50:44.400 --> 02:50:45.400]  Uncle Sam's Kids, that's it
[02:50:45.400 --> 02:50:47.400]  absolutely, it popped in my head as soon as I said it

[02:52:03.400 --> 02:52:07.400]  there's a huge and hushed up conspiracy going on
[02:52:07.400 --> 02:52:11.400]  that's about to turn your lives upside down in the coming few months
[02:52:11.400 --> 02:52:15.400]  unbelievably the media are keeping quiet about this
[02:52:15.400 --> 02:52:16.400]  I'm sure they know it
[02:52:16.400 --> 02:52:21.400]  but they probably know that revealing it on TV will generate mass hysteria and chaos
[02:52:21.400 --> 02:52:24.400]  but I believe you should be informed about it
[02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:27.400]  because when the sinister agenda is finally accomplished
[02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:29.400]  and everything unravels
[02:52:29.400 --> 02:52:33.400]  only those who know this secret info will survive and thrive

[02:55:25.400 --> 02:55:27.400]  over the truth
[02:55:27.400 --> 02:55:30.400]  in an ancient time
[02:55:30.400 --> 02:55:35.400]  brotherly love
[02:55:35.400 --> 02:55:39.400]  the sisterly love
[02:55:39.400 --> 02:55:41.400]  I feel this morning
[02:55:41.400 --> 02:55:43.400]  I feel this morning
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:46.400]  it's probably one of my favorite bomb barley songs
[02:55:46.400 --> 02:55:48.400]  what's one about I hear the birds tweet
[02:55:48.400 --> 02:55:52.400]  that one my kids love that

[02:55:56.400 --> 02:56:02.400]  tabletop it's called Three Little Birds
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:04.400]  they don't want to see us unite
[02:56:04.400 --> 02:56:06.400]  they want to see us all in fight with each other
[02:56:06.400 --> 02:56:08.400]  that's the mark of a fed right there folks
[02:56:08.400 --> 02:56:11.400]  that's the mark of a globalist right there
[02:56:11.400 --> 02:56:14.400]  I say unite around liberty and freedom and justice
[02:56:14.400 --> 02:56:16.400]  and not fight with each other
[02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:18.400]  let's go to Chris in Kentucky then Julio

[02:56:26.400 --> 02:56:28.400]  you've been calling me like 15 16 years
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:30.400]  I haven't heard from you in years
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:32.400]  yeah it's been a long time I've been busy
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:34.400]  slaving too and trying to get through
[02:56:34.400 --> 02:56:36.400]  that's right you used to run a TV station or something right
[02:56:36.400 --> 02:56:38.400]  no I didn't run a TV station I had somebody
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:40.400]  that had a radio show here that was kicked off
[02:56:40.400 --> 02:56:42.400]  of course there was some time
[02:56:42.400 --> 02:56:44.400]  you were working with somebody on TV station
[02:56:44.400 --> 02:56:46.400]  it doesn't matter go ahead
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:49.400]  yeah the homicide problem here in the loyalty
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:51.400]  the solution is now let's get the
[02:56:51.400 --> 02:56:53.400]  federal agents in the military helping with the police
[02:56:53.400 --> 02:56:55.400]  and they're making it sound so sweet on the news
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:56:57.400]  you know it's not going to
[02:56:57.400 --> 02:56:59.400]  oh no no no they collapse society
[02:56:59.400 --> 02:57:02.400]  ship the drugs in and now in Louisville Kentucky
[02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:04.400]  Chicago Illinois Dallas Texas
[02:57:04.400 --> 02:57:06.400]  let's put troops on the streets
[02:57:06.400 --> 02:57:08.400]  who was then aimed at the people
[02:57:08.400 --> 02:57:10.400]  no we're going into martial law
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:12.400]  and Chris you've been listening 15 years
[02:57:12.400 --> 02:57:14.400]  did I not say it would be done like this
[02:57:14.400 --> 02:57:16.400]  incrementally you predicted it right
[02:57:16.400 --> 02:57:18.400]  and here it is it's right in the front
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:20.400]  it wasn't hard I went to the drills and they admitted it
[02:57:20.400 --> 02:57:22.400]  how does you know Jones oh they said exactly
[02:57:22.400 --> 02:57:24.400]  it means like how do they know
[02:57:24.400 --> 02:57:26.400]  well they said one two three and they did one two three
[02:57:26.400 --> 02:57:28.400]  yeah I tell you
[02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:30.400]  well military better leave me alone
[02:57:30.400 --> 02:57:32.400]  it's getting the point where I'm running into it
[02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:34.400]  and they're usually nice guys too
[02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:36.400]  but they're there to acclimate and I'm like
[02:57:36.400 --> 02:57:38.400]  you should not be here with the police go ahead
[02:57:38.400 --> 02:57:40.400]  yeah you're absolutely right and I tell you
[02:57:40.400 --> 02:57:42.400]  I want to thank you for having a interview
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:44.400]  with Sheriff Denny Payman from Jackson County
[02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:46.400]  in this state that's a great guy
[02:57:46.400 --> 02:57:48.400]  that's the answer to
[02:57:48.400 --> 02:57:50.400]  Terney is that that man is 1776
[02:57:50.400 --> 02:57:52.400]  that's exactly what we need
[02:57:52.400 --> 02:57:54.400]  is every sheriff in this country
[02:57:54.400 --> 02:57:56.400]  we need because if we don't you know it's over
[02:57:56.400 --> 02:57:58.400]  well let's get on and get aboard
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:00.400]  Patriot sheriffs and police chiefs
[02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:02.400]  is they're good men and women
[02:58:02.400 --> 02:58:04.400]  they're well spoken they care
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:06.400]  they have a lot of liberty in their eyes
[02:58:06.400 --> 02:58:08.400]  then you see these sacks of
[02:58:08.400 --> 02:58:10.400]  garbage that are there with
[02:58:10.400 --> 02:58:12.400]  holder at these anti-gun things
[02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:14.400]  with Feinstein and they look like clowns
[02:58:14.400 --> 02:58:16.400]  in the little police outfits
[02:58:16.400 --> 02:58:18.400]  and all I mean they're a joke
[02:58:18.400 --> 02:58:20.400]  I will not be ruled by a bunch of criminals
[02:58:20.400 --> 02:58:22.400]  God bless you sir
[02:58:22.400 --> 02:58:24.400]  good to hear from that guy
[02:58:24.400 --> 02:58:26.400]  yeah guys pull that up I actually saw that a week ago
[02:58:26.400 --> 02:58:28.400]  and never covered it
[02:58:28.400 --> 02:58:30.400]  call for military on streets of Louisville
[02:58:30.400 --> 02:58:32.400]  by the way I show off around here
[02:58:32.400 --> 02:58:34.400]  that I am able to
[02:58:34.400 --> 02:58:36.400]  say it Louisville
[02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:38.400]  not Louisville
[02:58:38.400 --> 02:58:40.400]  alright ladies and gentlemen

[02:58:46.400 --> 02:58:48.400]  it's for your guns folks
[02:58:48.400 --> 02:58:50.400]  make no mistake it's all acclimation

[02:59:54.800 --> 03:00:01.760]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:08.720 --> 03:00:14.320]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers?
[03:00:14.320 --> 03:00:23.200]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[03:00:23.200 --> 03:00:44.800]  Alex Jones.
[03:00:44.800 --> 03:00:48.080]  Here's some of the headlines up on infowars.com breaking.
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:54.160]  Activist group demands UN stop Chicago from closing public schools. We told you that was
[03:00:54.160 --> 03:00:58.880]  coming with Obama. That was his plan to where it's all corporate run schools that are even worse
[03:00:58.880 --> 03:01:04.880]  than the government schools. Robbery of Cyprus bank accounts doubles in size.
[03:01:07.120 --> 03:01:13.600]  You hear about a robbery of a hotel room jewels in France, but what about a 47.5%
[03:01:13.600 --> 03:01:20.320]  robbery of Cyprus bank accounts doubles in size. Globalist adjaprop, Hillary Clinton,
[03:01:22.640 --> 03:01:28.960]  the miniseries, I'll take Kurt's, Kurt's write a lot of articles. I don't know if the average
[03:01:28.960 --> 03:01:35.440]  person knows what a adjaprop is. I barely remember what it is in Soviet nomenclature.
[03:01:35.440 --> 03:01:40.400]  And Rand Paul strikes back against anti-freedom enemies. Government promises to stop line
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:45.760]  because of drudge report spotlight MSNBC host says new worm infants don't count as alive.
[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:50.560]  Joining the chorus Pentagon says they have lost controlled independent media led by
[03:01:51.360 --> 03:01:57.600]  drudge. 80% of us adults are near poverty rely on welfare or unemployed. Yep, that's why they're
[03:01:57.600 --> 03:02:02.560]  winning. We're winning the waking up people that can be woken up, but the globalist are just gutting
[03:02:02.560 --> 03:02:07.840]  the country so fast it makes my head spin. Let's go to Julio real fast. You're on the air. What's
[03:02:07.840 --> 03:02:13.520]  your take? Julio on the Pentagon press conference. You know, I watched that entire press conference
[03:02:13.520 --> 03:02:20.240]  last night and it was just so interesting to see George little the way he would fake laugh from
[03:02:20.240 --> 03:02:35.840]  time to time. It was just so fascinating watching that that one woman who spoke
[03:02:35.840 --> 03:02:44.720]  about propaganda and spin and how quickly little George little tried to steer away from that. Oh,
[03:02:44.720 --> 03:02:50.880]  I don't want to refer to it as spin, but yes, we do have to tell the truth. And he mentioned about
[03:02:50.880 --> 03:02:56.960]  smartphones and technology really driving independent media, alternative media. He's
[03:02:56.960 --> 03:03:04.080]  basically admitting that the listening audience myself, anyone is a journalist has the ability
[03:03:04.080 --> 03:03:09.680]  right now to get any piece of information at real time speed. Well, yeah, that's what freaks
[03:03:09.680 --> 03:03:14.960]  them out as he said, look, we can't lie when their smartphone will show a photo of it. So really,
[03:03:15.680 --> 03:03:21.760]  they're just shifting game plan and saying we're going to be good guys now for the demoralized
[03:03:21.760 --> 03:03:26.640]  psychorps that don't like being deceptive and or being deceptive against good people.
[03:03:26.640 --> 03:03:31.600]  But that's the lie. You become deceptive against bad. You don't become, you know, good. You become
[03:03:31.600 --> 03:03:38.160]  bad. And it's a very sophisticated thing. But the whole point is they are running the white flag up
[03:03:38.160 --> 03:03:42.320]  and saying, we're rolling out cyber security against the web, we're going to infiltrate the
[03:03:42.320 --> 03:03:47.440]  local media, we're going to buy people off. That's not going to work either because globalism is
[03:03:47.440 --> 03:03:54.800]  going to shut everything down. No matter how much BS they shovel reality will come to the fore. And
[03:03:54.800 --> 03:03:59.040]  as long as we point out, we have state run media, the globalist or criminal, the government's
[03:03:59.040 --> 03:04:03.520]  illegitimate, it's over for the new world order. Do you agree with that term, state run media?
[03:04:04.480 --> 03:04:08.400]  Oh, absolutely. I call it corporate media, since they're all run by multinational corporations.
[03:04:08.400 --> 03:04:13.840]  They work for the megacorporations of the world. Yeah, but they're using the state
[03:04:13.840 --> 03:04:19.600]  with our taxpayer money and stuff to direct it. From my experience when I covered NATO last summer,
[03:04:19.600 --> 03:04:24.240]  I saw state run media. I thought being inside the NATO summit, we were going to get actual
[03:04:24.240 --> 03:04:30.720]  documents, real information of what's going on. Instead, we got PR emails of what they agreed on
[03:04:30.720 --> 03:04:38.400]  in every news organization from around the world. That's why the Pentagon and the White House have
[03:04:38.400 --> 03:04:42.960]  said, let's just go to straight up, not even press conferences, we'll put a statement out.
[03:04:42.960 --> 03:04:48.480]  But then the better side helps folks go, oh no, they'll pick that apart. Let's go engage them.
[03:04:49.040 --> 03:04:52.640]  But they'll just buy off one blogger and then another blogger will start up.
[03:04:52.640 --> 03:04:57.520]  Look, it's over. It's over. The only question is we have to go through what the Germans did
[03:04:57.520 --> 03:05:01.360]  or the Russians did before we wake up to it. Please, let's learn from history, folks.

[03:06:07.920 --> 03:06:14.480]  I want you to know some very important information. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that
[03:06:14.480 --> 03:06:19.120]  carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the president could obtain this
[03:06:19.120 --> 03:06:25.200]  world-class healer. Now, 27 years later, carnivore capsules are used around the world to keep people
[03:06:25.200 --> 03:06:31.280]  healthy. Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally

[03:08:29.600 --> 03:08:33.600]  Torturing children. I mean, you can go look at it. It's all up there. It's a daily stream.
[03:08:33.600 --> 03:08:37.280]  We're going to get Syrian girl who predicted it all over a year ago on this show on
[03:08:38.160 --> 03:08:41.280]  with us to go over it all in the next few days. We're going to get G. Edward Griffin on the
[03:08:41.280 --> 03:08:45.760]  broadcast as well and a lot of other very informative guests. I promise to go to your
[03:08:45.760 --> 03:08:50.240]  phone calls. Let's continue with your phone calls. I want to play a clip I didn't get to earlier
[03:08:50.240 --> 03:08:58.880]  of Greenwald saying, look, they lied to us. The NSA, their lowliest employees can dial
[03:08:58.880 --> 03:09:04.560]  right in and listen to you in a lifetime. Folks, that's been done since World War II.
[03:09:06.560 --> 03:09:09.920]  That without warrants, they would have operators punch in and listen to people.
[03:09:10.880 --> 03:09:14.640]  But now they've just got it where they can dial in. Just like you could have an app to follow
[03:09:14.640 --> 03:09:18.880]  your husband or wife with their cell phone. That app doubles for you to be able to use it.
[03:09:18.880 --> 03:09:26.320]  That's the system by law globally engineered into all the phones of international conferences so
[03:09:26.320 --> 03:09:31.280]  the governments can track you. Of course, they're now announcing, Alex, it's true. There's face
[03:09:31.280 --> 03:09:37.120]  scanning cameras on the street corners. Alex, it's true. They're following everybody. Stores
[03:09:37.120 --> 03:09:42.320]  are using your purchase history to rip you off and charge you more. That's why they have digital
[03:09:42.320 --> 03:09:50.240]  price tags now. They're using this Intel and the smart meters are controlling your thermostat
[03:09:50.240 --> 03:09:54.880]  and charging you. Yeah, they all said they were going to do this. I keep trying to explain that
[03:09:54.880 --> 03:09:59.280]  to people. I don't just get up here and say, 15 years ago, they're going to have smart meters
[03:09:59.280 --> 03:10:05.600]  and track everything you do and control your thermostat. I was reading from MIT and I'm
[03:10:05.600 --> 03:10:08.400]  telling you, everything I've seen these people say they're going to do, they're going to do it.
[03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:13.520]  They write books about all the stuff they put in the water to hurt us. I mean, these are murderers
[03:10:14.320 --> 03:10:18.000]  and quite frankly, legally and lawfully, under common law, we could all get violent with these
[03:10:18.000 --> 03:10:25.440]  people right now. But that would play into their plan. I want to awaken humanity and try to have
[03:10:25.440 --> 03:10:30.320]  as least bloodshed as possible. When we start cornering these people, they're going to get
[03:10:30.320 --> 03:10:34.400]  violent and blame us for it already. We want to be able to expose they did that violence and show
[03:10:34.400 --> 03:10:41.920]  how bad they are instead of go out and have them frame our violence as OC proof or bad.
[03:10:42.960 --> 03:10:46.880]  And they know they're going to force people into confrontation. And for those of you that
[03:10:46.880 --> 03:10:51.120]  want confrontation, you're going to probably get it. This probably isn't going to get fixed
[03:10:51.120 --> 03:10:55.760]  without a lot of bloodshed at one point. The question is, is it a few thousand dead
[03:10:56.800 --> 03:11:01.600]  and then they stand down and get arrested? Or is it going to be 100 million dead in the US?
[03:11:01.600 --> 03:11:06.720]  The communists, and that's basically who these people are. They're technocrats above it, but it's a
[03:11:06.720 --> 03:11:14.400]  communist model. In the 70s, it was declassified when they took over with reeducation camps
[03:11:14.400 --> 03:11:19.040]  with the weathermen that they wanted to kill 50 million people. You can look up those video
[03:11:19.040 --> 03:11:24.720]  clips from people that were in the trials, those film clips. I mean, look, people say,
[03:11:24.720 --> 03:11:27.760]  what do they want? They want to kill people. They want to be able to come to your house
[03:11:27.760 --> 03:11:32.080]  and torture you while they rape your wife. I mean, and you're like, why? Because that's
[03:11:32.080 --> 03:11:37.280]  what they like to do. They don't like working hard and being good and building things and
[03:11:37.280 --> 03:11:40.960]  being wholesome and having good friends. They like hurting people. I mean, if you not figured
[03:11:40.960 --> 03:11:45.120]  that out yet, have you not studied history yet? And if we don't stand up against them,
[03:11:45.120 --> 03:11:50.720]  they're going to have their way. So all I could say is let's work as hard as we can in the sunshine
[03:11:51.280 --> 03:11:55.360]  as the sun sets on liberty, because it's going to come back around. Don't worry,
[03:11:55.360 --> 03:11:59.840]  the sun will rise again. Let's work to get as many people as awake as possible
[03:12:00.480 --> 03:12:03.920]  so that when the sun really goes down, people wake up and know what to do.
[03:12:05.520 --> 03:12:09.760]  Because let me tell you, folks, if it goes to a full bore civil war, it ain't going to stop.
[03:12:10.320 --> 03:12:14.480]  And it's going to be bad. And for all the people that serve the system,
[03:12:15.200 --> 03:12:18.160]  some of you macho guys that think you're going to have a war with the American people,
[03:12:18.160 --> 03:12:24.560]  you're going to show us your fools. You have taken the restraint of the American patriot as
[03:12:24.560 --> 03:12:30.960]  weakness. You have no idea. You have no idea how hard you're going to get hammered. All right,
[03:12:30.960 --> 03:12:35.840]  ladies and gentlemen, let's go to your phone calls. Let's talk to Aaron in Texas. You're on the air.
[03:12:35.840 --> 03:12:40.960]  Go ahead. Mr. Jones, it's a pleasure. Good to talk to you. Yes, sir. I'm calling. Earlier,
[03:12:40.960 --> 03:12:44.400]  the caller called you and accused you of being a sigh-up. And one of the things that you said
[03:12:44.400 --> 03:12:49.200]  was that you were in a fighting stance, and it reminded me of something that I say to people
[03:12:49.200 --> 03:12:54.080]  a lot. When I'm talking to people about politics and or the stuff that's discussed on your show,
[03:12:54.080 --> 03:13:00.800]  a lot of times they are irritated or they say things like, that gives me bad energy and they
[03:13:00.800 --> 03:13:05.120]  basically don't want to hear it because it bothers them. When I was growing up, I grew up in the
[03:13:05.120 --> 03:13:10.400]  Taekwondo studio and when I first started sparring, my first opponent was larger than me and he was
[03:13:10.400 --> 03:13:15.760]  more aggressive than me. And he started punching me in the face and I didn't like it. And so I
[03:13:15.760 --> 03:13:20.000]  looked away and when he's still punching me, I looked away and my instructor heard him yell at
[03:13:20.000 --> 03:13:28.000]  me, don't look away, he's still hitting you. And I can't get that out of my head. And I learned that
[03:13:28.000 --> 03:13:31.920]  if there's a threat, I have to face it. If I look away, he's still hitting me.
[03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:38.080]  Well, that's right. I mean, they call it bad energy because they're kind of in a frog that's
[03:13:38.080 --> 03:13:43.360]  rolled over in the boiling pot and has decided to die. And yeah, it might hurt at first to climb
[03:13:43.360 --> 03:13:48.320]  out of the water before it kills you. But look, I'm up here three hours and 13 minutes into this
[03:13:48.320 --> 03:13:53.440]  show. I got up early this morning. I worked yesterday till late. I've dealt with incredible
[03:13:54.240 --> 03:14:00.720]  just BS off record in the last 48 hours. I was up here Saturday working, you know, seven, eight
[03:14:00.720 --> 03:14:06.720]  hours. I'm not complaining. I can't quit knowing what I know. I can't quit understanding what I
[03:14:06.720 --> 03:14:12.800]  understand. I learned more exponentially every week. And just like people said, oh my gosh,
[03:14:12.800 --> 03:14:18.560]  she got mad at Pierce Morgan. It was discrediting. The founding fathers wrote around saying get guns
[03:14:18.560 --> 03:14:22.080]  and kill people because they were coming to take our guns. I'm not saying that. We're like, oh,
[03:14:22.080 --> 03:14:27.200]  they're heroes. I'm telling a red coat, you surfer liar. Hey, you know, this is about taking our
[03:14:27.200 --> 03:14:31.760]  guns and stop acting like it didn't. You know, all the people pushing these bills want a gun ban
[03:14:31.760 --> 03:14:35.120]  while they're arm into the teeth. Watch it, buddy. You're going to cause a civil war,
[03:14:35.120 --> 03:14:40.880]  which is what the global is playing. So watch it. And then, oh, you say 9 11's an inside job.
[03:14:40.880 --> 03:14:44.880]  I'm like, I saw them on TV, say they were going to blow up building seven and I watched them
[03:14:44.880 --> 03:14:51.920]  blow it up and I got the video of it. Shut up scumbag. I mean, stop telling me what I know is
[03:14:51.920 --> 03:14:57.200]  true. It didn't stop gaslighting me. Stop lying to me. That's what the Pentagon said. They said it
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:15:01.360]  is not working. They just lie to them outright. We got to infiltrate them. We got to take them
[03:15:01.360 --> 03:15:05.680]  over. Everybody was just sitting there sick in the meeting going, we don't like to propagandize
[03:15:05.680 --> 03:15:09.760]  foreigners. We know this country's run by evil. Now we're going to have to engage the American
[03:15:09.760 --> 03:15:14.640]  people. I could look at that audience and tell you most of them we've got. Most of them look sick.
[03:15:16.240 --> 03:15:19.600]  That's where you really learned what was happening in that Pentagon briefing.
[03:15:19.600 --> 03:15:22.560]  I just want to tell the new world order and they know this with the NSA stuff.
[03:15:23.360 --> 03:15:28.960]  You people are in a bad position. And I know you got all the high tech weapons and the propaganda
[03:15:28.960 --> 03:15:33.040]  still and you think you're going to control things. You control the resources and you've wrecked most
[03:15:33.040 --> 03:15:39.040]  of the public mentally to where they can't fight back. It doesn't matter. If 5% of us fight back
[03:15:39.040 --> 03:15:43.280]  against you politically, we're going to tear your arms and legs out of their sockets like that.
[03:15:44.480 --> 03:15:49.200]  All I need is the 5% of people. It's more like 30 that are somewhat awake. But if 5%
[03:15:50.160 --> 03:15:54.800]  of the American people, ladies and gentlemen, just start resisting, speaking out, warning others,
[03:15:54.800 --> 03:16:00.240]  the buzz will be so big it will resonate psychologically with people's own survival instinct
[03:16:00.240 --> 03:16:05.280]  that they have and it's over. Okay? People, listen to all the people that serve the system and you
[03:16:05.280 --> 03:16:09.600]  already know this. You already know now you're going to get screwed. You think you're going to play
[03:16:09.600 --> 03:16:13.840]  along with it? You're going to lose everything. The only way to beat this and it doesn't mean you've
[03:16:13.840 --> 03:16:18.640]  got to go Rambo people or you've got to find the secret and overthrow it. You've got to just speak
[03:16:18.640 --> 03:16:27.200]  out mildly. You've got to just say no mildly. You've got to just... I'm not going to even get into it.
[03:16:27.200 --> 03:16:31.920]  I got such a headache. I'll never get to your calls if I don't. It's just we're going to win
[03:16:31.920 --> 03:16:35.840]  this thing, folks, but we've all got to do a little something. That's what moves mountains.
[03:16:35.840 --> 03:16:40.720]  Okay? Not everybody's going to do what I've done, but there will be people in this fight who will
[03:16:40.720 --> 03:16:46.080]  dwarf what Alex Jones has done. And I've always known at a spiritual level, my job is here to just
[03:16:46.640 --> 03:16:51.840]  send a message out. Who will hear? Who has ears to hear? Eyes to see. We'll get it. And it's my job
[03:16:51.840 --> 03:16:59.040]  to energize the resistance. It's my job. It's my job not to be your leader. My job is just transmit
[03:16:59.040 --> 03:17:04.720]  the truth, resist, resist, resist, point out the enemy operations and just get people to
[03:17:04.720 --> 03:17:08.560]  understand what's happening and then God will do the rest. Okay? And I think that's what you
[03:17:08.560 --> 03:17:13.280]  should do as well. All right, let's go ahead and talk to... Thank you, Aaron. John and Pennsylvania,
[03:17:13.280 --> 03:17:19.600]  you're on the air. Hello, Alex. Hey, buddy. Thank you very much for this time and that's how valuable
[03:17:19.600 --> 03:17:26.560]  it is. First off, I'd like to say that I'm calling... I'm a volunteer for the Schooley for Congress
[03:17:26.560 --> 03:17:33.680]  campaign. The next Ron Paul was running in Pennsylvania ninth against Neocon, Billy Schuster,
[03:17:33.680 --> 03:17:39.280]  who is head of the Highway Transportation... Oh, yeah. There are a lot of libertarian constitutionalist
[03:17:40.400 --> 03:17:45.040]  Ted Cruz types, Rand Paul types that are coming up. I know some of them. I'm planning to have some
[03:17:45.040 --> 03:17:49.600]  of them on the air. And absolutely. And even if they don't win in every case, they will inject
[03:17:49.600 --> 03:17:55.280]  real issues in those debates. So running for office is a great way to inject truth into the
[03:17:55.280 --> 03:18:02.000]  propaganda spectrum. Like for all the info warriors, I've been a longtime listener. I copy all your
[03:18:02.000 --> 03:18:08.640]  videos and hand on grocery stores and markets. I just ran across this guy back and he was a 2008
[03:18:08.640 --> 03:18:13.600]  coordinator for the Paul campaign for in the Pennsylvania ninth and he ran as an alternate
[03:18:13.600 --> 03:18:21.920]  delegate last year in the last presidential election. He was a Ron Paul delegate. And what we
[03:18:21.920 --> 03:18:26.960]  really need is for all the info wars to go to Schooley for Congress. And I hate to beg for money
[03:18:26.960 --> 03:18:32.160]  on the show, Alex, but without any money, we're going to have a hard time. No, I understand,
[03:18:32.160 --> 03:18:35.920]  but listen to me for a minute. And I appreciate your call. We're doing reports on this. The whole
[03:18:35.920 --> 03:18:41.920]  media structure is going after Rand Paul, Ted Cruz types, Democrats, Republicans, Carl Rove, Joe
[03:18:41.920 --> 03:18:49.200]  Biden, Chris Christie, all of them because they're real. I wasn't sure about Ted Cruz being real
[03:18:49.200 --> 03:18:53.680]  because I didn't know him for 15 years, like a new Rand Paul, but he's for real. Rand Paul's
[03:18:53.680 --> 03:18:59.040]  for real. And a lot of these people getting like a mosh is for real. And there's a lot of people
[03:18:59.040 --> 03:19:03.760]  that are for real. And that's why they're threatened by it because it's just, you'd call the libertarian
[03:19:03.760 --> 03:19:11.840]  Republicans mainline just Americans, Democrats and Republicans 50 years ago, even 30 years ago.
[03:19:12.720 --> 03:19:16.000]  I mean, they just don't want to bankrupt the whole country. It's like Ross Perot said,
[03:19:16.000 --> 03:19:19.840]  and you move the jobs, Andy and China and Mexico and the whole country collapses. You
[03:19:19.840 --> 03:19:24.800]  all care about money, but I want my granddaughters have a country to live in. Yeah. I mean, where do
[03:19:24.800 --> 03:19:30.320]  you think you're going to go all these other places? I mean, because you build an economy here,
[03:19:30.320 --> 03:19:34.240]  then you can build up the third world. You don't ship it there and lower their standard.
[03:19:34.800 --> 03:19:39.760]  So you get to take over everything. I mean, it's just, it's, it's about scorched earth globalism.
[03:19:40.720 --> 03:19:44.640]  They're using economics as a weapon, folks. Obama's like wants to get the middle class
[03:19:44.640 --> 03:19:49.040]  going. He gave a speech today and you know, he cares about you. His job is to destroy the
[03:19:49.040 --> 03:19:55.200]  middle class and make you dependent on record. Let's talk to Tex in Texas.
[03:19:56.720 --> 03:20:02.560]  Tech shirt on the air. Go ahead. Okay. Thank you, Alex. Long time listener.
[03:20:04.480 --> 03:20:09.280]  You talked about Stonehenge when we're over in England.
[03:20:09.280 --> 03:20:15.200]  Yeah, I felt it. I went there because they wanted to go and I'm like, oh, look at it.
[03:20:15.200 --> 03:20:20.080]  It's so boring. You know, it looks small from the highway and I'm walking across this line.
[03:20:20.080 --> 03:20:25.600]  And it was like hit by electricity. I felt craved happened to everybody went back over it.
[03:20:25.600 --> 03:20:29.680]  And then the, and then the guy that was there, he said, I don't even believe in this stuff.
[03:20:29.680 --> 03:20:33.360]  And I must not have the, you know, the cells in my brain because they proven fish and other
[03:20:33.360 --> 03:20:37.360]  things, you know, can follow magnetic lines because everybody that has it, when they cross
[03:20:37.360 --> 03:20:45.600]  that line, they feel it, but go ahead and make your point. Okay. I was told this by my dad
[03:20:46.960 --> 03:20:50.640]  over 70 years ago. So that'll give you a clue. I'm an old man.
[03:20:52.560 --> 03:21:00.320]  The earth is a globe. It's not a flat pancake. But if you take a piece of white paper and lay it
[03:21:00.320 --> 03:21:07.440]  on the face of the globe using the one edge is a straight edge. And you put one edge of that
[03:21:07.440 --> 03:21:14.720]  paper in Boston and twist the paper around so that it goes through New York and then Philadelphia
[03:21:15.440 --> 03:21:18.800]  and then Baltimore. No, I got it. You can see what on the other side of the earth is,
[03:21:18.800 --> 03:21:22.160]  is where they're at. Yeah, I haven't done that. Guys, you hand me that globe. I want to see
[03:21:22.160 --> 03:21:29.040]  what's on the other side of Stonehenge. Thanks. Go ahead, sir. And you extend it down to Washington,
[03:21:29.040 --> 03:21:36.320]  D.C. and you extend that line. It goes back to Stonehenge. They knew something or what they
[03:21:36.320 --> 03:21:40.720]  knew. I don't know, but you can do it. And I don't try to prove it to you because it's...
[03:21:40.720 --> 03:21:45.840]  Oh, no, but you're absolutely right that the ancients all believe there were certain points
[03:21:45.840 --> 03:21:50.800]  and it's magnetics coming out of the earth there. And so the ancients would think it was magic
[03:21:50.800 --> 03:21:55.840]  when really the birds and other things follow those lines. That's not been proven with science.
[03:21:55.840 --> 03:22:01.520]  But I mean, if you cut right through from Stonehenge in southern England and shot right through the
[03:22:01.520 --> 03:22:09.760]  earth, I mean, it depends on what angle, but if you just went straight through, it would come out,
[03:22:12.000 --> 03:22:20.160]  come out, out in the ocean just south of Alaska looks like or, you know, let me see, come out
[03:22:20.160 --> 03:22:27.360]  over here, about 500, 600, 700 miles south of Alaska, it looks like. But I guess you could
[03:22:27.360 --> 03:22:31.280]  underground have some line. I know they have lay lines too. And I guess those... I mean,
[03:22:31.280 --> 03:22:34.320]  they say D.C. is on a lay line, but I think it's a different one. And I don't even know
[03:22:34.320 --> 03:22:39.040]  if those lay lines are real. It was just the ancients trying to map it. I mean, again, I just
[03:22:39.040 --> 03:22:43.280]  know that I'm like, all right, let's get over here and get back to London. Yeah, it's pretty neat.
[03:22:43.280 --> 03:22:47.520]  You know, I'm like, and then I'm just walking all of a sudden, and it's like, whoa, do you feel
[03:22:47.520 --> 03:22:56.160]  that? Leanne Magadou felt it. Watson felt it. His wife, Ian, felt it. And I mean, I felt like I was
[03:22:56.160 --> 03:23:00.720]  18 and was about to get in a fight with somebody. I mean, I'm not even angry. I felt electrified
[03:23:00.720 --> 03:23:05.280]  and crazed. And so the ancients didn't know what it was. They thought, oh my gosh, it's Oonga Boonga
[03:23:05.280 --> 03:23:10.480]  or whatever. But it's, I believe it's a magnetic vortex, but it wasn't just at stone inch. Because
[03:23:10.480 --> 03:23:15.360]  I felt something around. It's this, I mean, you would pass about a 10 foot wide line. And I walked
[03:23:15.360 --> 03:23:19.200]  through it and later said, you guys feel anything? They're like, yeah, back there. And we're like,
[03:23:19.200 --> 03:23:27.520]  yeah. So we'd go back over it. And it was like going over a roller coaster when your stomach goes up.
[03:23:28.400 --> 03:23:33.840]  And you feel, what's that called when you go down a hill real fast and you feel your stomach
[03:23:33.840 --> 03:23:40.080]  come up into your chest? I mean, there's a reason the ancients built stone circles all over the
[03:23:40.080 --> 03:23:46.000]  world on certain sites. And it's because there's something magnetic coming out of the ground
[03:23:46.000 --> 03:23:50.640]  there. And of course, we know at the Northern South Pole, there's massive electromagnetic
[03:23:50.640 --> 03:23:55.280]  stuff coming out. And they have measured higher electromagnetics coming out of that magnetic
[03:23:55.280 --> 03:24:04.480]  rock there. But anything else, sir? Well, that was that on stone inch. I just wondered if they
[03:24:04.480 --> 03:24:11.760]  told you anything about it. They knew something. They selected Washington DC specifically to be
[03:24:11.760 --> 03:24:20.240]  on this line. It just didn't happen. I had ancestors that had property there that eventually
[03:24:20.240 --> 03:24:29.040]  were taken into the Washington DC area. Second thing is the Royal Family of England. Second
[03:24:29.040 --> 03:24:37.920]  subject. Do I have time for that? Yeah, go ahead. Okay, I listened to you with Glee that you and
[03:24:37.920 --> 03:24:46.720]  Tex were not upset talking to each other, because this book he referred to, I don't know whether
[03:24:46.720 --> 03:24:53.120]  you've read it, Kessler's book on the 13th tribe. Are you familiar with that subject matter?
[03:24:53.120 --> 03:25:04.240]  Yes, yes. Okay. What evidently either the author of that name, Kessler, he did not know this. I
[03:25:04.240 --> 03:25:12.480]  don't know that Tex knows this. And I've seen it on just one place. But there was a part of the
[03:25:12.480 --> 03:25:22.320]  Askenazi Jews. His name was King Joseph. He went to Ireland. He did not disappear from history
[03:25:22.320 --> 03:25:27.280]  like he generally thought. No, they got the stone of destiny from Ireland, then it went to England.
[03:25:27.280 --> 03:25:35.360]  And then why is it in Scotland now? I'm not talking about that. Okay, go ahead. There is a
[03:25:35.360 --> 03:25:43.600]  reason, but I didn't want to sidetrack from that. There was a lot of inner marriage from the Kzar
[03:25:44.880 --> 03:25:51.040]  Askenazi Jews into the Royal Family of England. That's the point I want to make. Well, the Royal
[03:25:51.040 --> 03:25:56.960]  Family says that they do trace some of their lineage back to King David. I mean, they say that.
[03:25:56.960 --> 03:26:02.800]  It's British Israeliism, I think you call it. In fact, it predates even Israel being set up,
[03:26:02.800 --> 03:26:06.560]  and it's been going on for thousands of years. And that's kind of what the whole Merovingian
[03:26:06.560 --> 03:26:10.800]  bloodline is. They claim to go back to Jesus. And that's the Illuminati's big secret,
[03:26:11.680 --> 03:26:16.400]  is that the Royal Family is reportedly related to Jesus. And of course, the Bible says Jesus
[03:26:16.400 --> 03:26:21.360]  didn't have any children, but they say that's the big secret. That's the holy grail that they hide,
[03:26:21.360 --> 03:26:27.680]  is that the Royal Bloodline of Christ. And whether that's true or not, the Transylvanian
[03:26:27.680 --> 03:26:33.040]  bloodline that became one of the dominant German bloodlines is directly linked into the House of
[03:26:33.040 --> 03:26:39.920]  Windsor. It's not really even the, it's like, Mom Batten, Cobur, Goethos, like 15 names. And the
[03:26:39.920 --> 03:26:44.480]  truth is it's just a whole bunch of old royal families of Europe. I mean, they are Gaelic,
[03:26:44.480 --> 03:26:49.360]  they're Germanic, they're, undoubtedly there's some Middle Eastern in there. But the reason the
[03:26:49.360 --> 03:26:54.960]  Romanians, you know, Transylvanians got so rich was they kept getting paid to hold back the Muslims.
[03:26:55.760 --> 03:27:00.960]  And so that's why those folks then moved back into Germania and intermarried with the other
[03:27:00.960 --> 03:27:09.520]  royalty there. But I mean, it's a Heinz 57. That's like the Rothschilds are intermarried into the
[03:27:09.520 --> 03:27:15.600]  Royal Bloodlines. So when I say a German royal family or German death cult, it's really an
[03:27:15.600 --> 03:27:21.680]  Illuminati death cult. And that stuff goes back, you know, to Egypt. It's a Babylon mystery school
[03:27:21.680 --> 03:27:26.640]  and people take that out of context. But it's, but very interesting, sir, I appreciate your call.
[03:27:26.640 --> 03:27:31.040]  By the way, let me just plug something here. A, because it's what funds us, but more importantly,

[03:29:34.320 --> 03:29:37.520]  shouldn't be on radio. I need to go rest for about 30 minutes. I got a bunch of work to do
[03:29:38.160 --> 03:29:42.960]  here with the Obama deception to the nightly news tonight, 7 o'clock central. But we love you all.
