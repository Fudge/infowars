[00:00:06.582 --> 00:00:08.704]  Big Brother.
[00:00:08.704 --> 00:00:11.486]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:11.486 --> 00:00:14.028]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:14.028 --> 00:00:16.030]  You want answers?
[00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.931]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:27.439]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.240]  Welcome, my friends, welcome.
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.264]  Thank you all for joining us on this April 1st, 2012 Sunday transmission.
[00:00:36.764 --> 00:00:41.067]  And no, there's not going to be any April Fool's jokes today, so don't be looking for that.
[00:00:41.067 --> 00:00:47.432]  We've got too much serious information going on in this society to play games with people.
[00:00:47.432 --> 00:00:53.637]  But we do have a very special premiere transmission for you this Sunday.
[00:00:53.637 --> 00:00:57.760]  We're going to be airing some segments that have not been on the radio yet.
[00:00:59.177 --> 00:01:06.159]  Namely, my analysis of the occultic slash off-world systems that the elite believe in.
[00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.740]  I'm not saying I believe in it, it's what they believe in.
[00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.301]  Just like pygmies believe in worshipping rocks and plants as animists, doesn't mean I believe in that.
[00:01:14.301 --> 00:01:23.104]  But as a sociologist, anthropologist, as someone trying to understand what the globalists are doing, what the psychopaths are doing, I study it and our discoveries about
[00:01:23.624 --> 00:01:28.632]  This upcoming Ridley Scott film, Prometheus, are nothing less than amazing.
[00:01:28.632 --> 00:01:34.822]  That's going to be a little 10-minute piece coming up later in the transmission.
[00:01:34.822 --> 00:01:37.667]  Well, I guess at the end of this hour is when we're going to be airing that.
[00:01:39.446 --> 00:01:45.532]  Also, I interviewed rock legend Billy Corrigan, founder of the Smashing Pumpkins, and also prolific songwriter.
[00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:50.997]  It's been a really popular interview that we aired last week for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:01:50.997 --> 00:01:55.942]  That's going to premiere here on the radio for all to be able to hear it.
[00:01:55.942 --> 00:02:01.167]  I did an incredible interview last Thursday, just a couple days ago, with David Icke.
[00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:05.788]  And that was only for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers.
[00:02:05.788 --> 00:02:09.411]  From time to time I like to air stuff, especially here on the Sunday Show.
[00:02:09.411 --> 00:02:12.254]  That was probably the best interview I've ever done with him.
[00:02:12.254 --> 00:02:14.436]  And he talked about a wide range of subjects.
[00:02:14.436 --> 00:02:18.579]  David Icke's coming up, that kind of dovetails with the whole Prometheus situation.
[00:02:19.602 --> 00:02:22.983]  We're going to be doing David Icke in the last two segments of the second hour.
[00:02:22.983 --> 00:02:24.443]  And Dave Mustaine!
[00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:26.524]  We did an in-depth interview a few weeks ago.
[00:02:26.524 --> 00:02:27.764]  Again, very, very popular.
[00:02:27.764 --> 00:02:29.225]  A big news maker.
[00:02:29.225 --> 00:02:30.105]  And why is that important?
[00:02:30.105 --> 00:02:32.046]  It got people talking about real issues.
[00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:37.908]  You know, when people find out these celebrities are listeners, their entire fan base starts tuning in to what we're doing.
[00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:45.570]  And it just shows the solidarity of Liberty Lovers and that there's so many people awake and concerned with what's happening.
[00:02:47.137 --> 00:02:49.279]  On our planet today.
[00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:51.460]  So that is coming up as well.
[00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.602]  But it is April 1st.
[00:02:53.602 --> 00:02:56.464]  Hard to believe we're already into the fourth month of 2012.
[00:02:56.464 --> 00:02:59.927]  The fourth month of 2012.
[00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:06.712]  That is all coming up today and more on this special Sunday edition.
[00:03:06.712 --> 00:03:11.475]  Look, I didn't really cover the Trayvon Martin thing very much in the last week or two.
[00:03:11.475 --> 00:03:12.356]  I covered it a little bit.
[00:03:13.311 --> 00:03:15.674]  And I said, look, it's a media high pokes.
[00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:17.036]  I'm sad what happened to him.
[00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:19.539]  We don't know the full story.
[00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:24.606]  But the media is trying to create a race war here.
[00:03:24.606 --> 00:03:27.389]  And now it's becoming clearer and clearer.
[00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.892]  Every time I walk by the three or four televisions.
[00:03:31.434 --> 00:03:37.539]  I say three or four, because sometimes one of them and none, that are on different so-called news channels, ABC, CBS, NBC.
[00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:40.941]  You know, we watch the nightly news and we're here sometimes to monitor it.
[00:03:40.941 --> 00:03:46.145]  But Fox is on, CNN, MSNBC, CNBC.
[00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:47.206]  That's all they're talking about!
[00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.493]  Not the depression, not the dollar devaluation, none of it.
[00:03:51.493 --> 00:03:54.156]  And it's tens of thousands of people marching in L.A.
[00:03:54.156 --> 00:03:58.740]  and in Florida and Spike Lee, you know, giving out.
[00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.102]  It's one thing to Twitter somebody's house and say, go get them.
[00:04:01.102 --> 00:04:02.684]  That's bad enough.
[00:04:02.684 --> 00:04:05.026]  And if I did that, I'd be arrested.
[00:04:05.026 --> 00:04:07.868]  But now, twittering the wrong people's house?
[00:04:09.074 --> 00:04:25.822]  And the media playing into this and trying to build it up and then media matters saying Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com is a racist because he posted one of the more recent photos of Trayvon sporting the grill and all that and you know older and bigger.
[00:04:26.721 --> 00:04:35.085]  And then of course it turned out it was a real photo, but it's just, it's crazy how the system is engaged in divide and conquer.
[00:04:35.085 --> 00:04:44.669]  So I'm going to come back, hit that a little bit, and we're going to get into the Billy Cornigan, the breakdown of Prometheus, the David Icke.
[00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:47.031]  All of this is going to be quite a transmission.
[00:04:47.031 --> 00:04:51.333]  I want to say great job to the crew as well in here on Sunday getting this together.
[00:04:51.333 --> 00:04:51.793]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:07.569]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.712]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:05:12.712 --> 00:05:21.436]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:05:21.436 --> 00:05:25.519]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:27.820]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[00:05:39.598 --> 00:05:41.739]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:05:41.739 --> 00:05:43.520]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.401]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:50.644]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection.
[00:05:50.644 --> 00:05:53.045]  So you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:05:53.045 --> 00:05:55.746]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:05:55.746 --> 00:05:57.327]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:05:57.327 --> 00:05:58.107]  Got it.
[00:05:58.107 --> 00:05:58.968]  Others don't.
[00:06:05.501 --> 00:06:09.004]  Oh yeah!
[00:06:09.004 --> 00:06:11.285]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[00:06:11.285 --> 00:06:12.706]  Broadcasting Worldwide.
[00:06:12.706 --> 00:06:13.787]  Hit me!
[00:06:13.787 --> 00:06:21.472]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:06:21.472 --> 00:06:28.417]  50,000 unstoppable watts!
[00:06:28.417 --> 00:06:35.002]  It's hard to turn that off.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.802]  Clutch going there for you, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:06:41.802 --> 00:06:43.003]  Shout out to those guys.
[00:06:43.003 --> 00:06:47.385]  All right, we really do have a big transmission lined up for you today.
[00:06:47.385 --> 00:06:50.547]  Very, very proud of what we've got here for you.
[00:06:50.547 --> 00:06:57.831]  Once a month or so, I like to do a Sunday show, and it is April Fool's, but there won't be any joking here on this Sunday, April 1st.
[00:06:57.831 --> 00:07:05.296]  Sometimes, once a month, every five weeks or so, on average, we like to have a show where I take clips
[00:07:05.856 --> 00:07:16.965]  Special news reports, special interviews from InfoWars Nightly News that airs five nights a week, seven o'clock central at InfoWarsNews.com or PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:07:16.965 --> 00:07:18.866]  It's already on British television.
[00:07:18.866 --> 00:07:20.768]  It's already on some cable systems here in the U.S.
[00:07:20.768 --> 00:07:22.269]  without us even trying.
[00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:25.391]  I've been beta testing in the last eight months and it is subscription.
[00:07:25.391 --> 00:07:28.434]  Members get it first and get nine years of stuff I've posted there.
[00:07:28.434 --> 00:07:29.715]  It's nine years in April.
[00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:34.919]  It's now, in a couple days, it'll be nine years we've had PrisonPlanet.tv up and operating and
[00:07:35.459 --> 00:07:41.245]  It's 15 cents a day, but you can go and do a 15-day free trial right now if you want to see nine years of material.
[00:07:41.245 --> 00:07:42.166]  I mean, it's an archive.
[00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:46.170]  Plus, you're supporting alternative media that's stomping the dinosaur media into the ground.
[00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.093]  But that said, big transmission lined up for you.
[00:07:49.093 --> 00:07:53.138]  We've got Dave Mustaine, who was on the nightly news in studio with us a few weeks ago.
[00:07:53.138 --> 00:07:54.279]  This hadn't been on radio yet.
[00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:56.641]  It made dozens of major newspapers reported on it.
[00:07:56.641 --> 00:07:58.043]  Rolling Stone, you name it, talked about it.
[00:07:58.183 --> 00:07:58.423]  I don't
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.781]  We're good to go.
[00:08:30.702 --> 00:08:40.070]  I've gotten some behind-the-scenes intel on this, and it's the big Ridley Scott alien prequel, and it really ties into what the elite believe is real.
[00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:45.033]  I don't believe it, but the elite believe that they're channeling off-world spacemen.
[00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:53.660]  And so when you see this movie that's coming up, that's basically what you're seeing is a story of creation that a lot of the top globalists actually believe is real.
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.983]  So they're kind of giving you a revelation of the method or what they're into.
[00:08:57.923 --> 00:08:59.343]  Kind of chariots of the gods.
[00:08:59.343 --> 00:09:01.924]  You know, they're practically falling out of the sky.
[00:09:01.924 --> 00:09:06.445]  That's coming up and I think the best interview I've ever done with David Icke.
[00:09:06.445 --> 00:09:07.485]  Parts of that are coming up.
[00:09:07.485 --> 00:09:09.125]  I did it just a few nights ago on the Nightly News.
[00:09:09.125 --> 00:09:10.285]  It was in-depth.
[00:09:10.285 --> 00:09:13.066]  It was almost an hour long on a host of subjects.
[00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:14.846]  David Icke, love him, hate him.
[00:09:14.846 --> 00:09:16.727]  Interesting fellow.
[00:09:16.727 --> 00:09:19.567]  And it ties into the whole Prometheus situation.
[00:09:19.567 --> 00:09:22.388]  So that's your jam-packed transmission this Sunday.
[00:09:22.388 --> 00:09:24.348]  I gotta just say this on the Trayvon Martin thing.
[00:09:24.668 --> 00:09:31.450]  I'm going to really cover this more Monday, because this is getting out of control on the Monday weekday show from 11 to 2 Central, 11 a.m.
[00:09:31.450 --> 00:09:31.830]  to 2 p.m.
[00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:32.410]  Central.
[00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:38.412]  This is getting out of control with Spike Lee last week, twittering, you know, here's where he lives, go get him.
[00:09:38.412 --> 00:09:39.712]  And it wasn't even the right house.
[00:09:39.712 --> 00:09:42.553]  It's totally illegal to say, here's where somebody lives, go get him.
[00:09:42.553 --> 00:09:50.015]  It's totally illegal to have the Black Panther Party, the new Black Panther Party, say, give us money, 10,000 people, arrest him, grab him.
[00:09:50.655 --> 00:09:54.738]  I mean, regardless of what's going on here, you don't say, go get somebody.
[00:09:54.738 --> 00:09:56.980]  All I know is if I did that, I'd be arrested.
[00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:06.949]  And a lot of the Trayvon cases turned out that black witnesses, I've seen them on the news, his neighbors, are like, well, no, the guy in the red shirt had the guy with the hoodie on top of him hitting him.
[00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:08.190]  I mean, that's on record.
[00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:15.316]  But once Jesse Jackson launches, once Al Sharpton launches to get a bunch of attention and threaten race war, basically, is what's going on here.
[00:10:15.916 --> 00:10:23.600]  And once the establishment media gets into it with this divide and conquer, it is off to the races, just like with the lacrosse situation.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:25.641]  With Duke, turned out that was all made up.
[00:10:25.641 --> 00:10:26.882]  Did they apologize for that?
[00:10:26.882 --> 00:10:27.342]  No.
[00:10:27.342 --> 00:10:30.904]  So is there such a situation as driving all black or walking all black?
[00:10:31.024 --> 00:10:33.725]  Yeah, I think blacks get discriminated against sometimes.
[00:10:33.725 --> 00:10:34.686]  I'm sad that happens.
[00:10:34.686 --> 00:10:36.566]  I'm not denying that that doesn't go on.
[00:10:36.566 --> 00:10:44.430]  But the hoax here is the giant media response to all this, and it being the number one story, we've got so many other issues going on.
[00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.791]  And then Paul Watson had an article on Infowars.com just a few days ago.
[00:10:48.791 --> 00:10:51.533]  Twitter, spamming celebrities, not okay.
[00:10:51.533 --> 00:10:53.293]  But advocating murder is fine.
[00:10:53.293 --> 00:10:59.176]  Yeah, they'll block us putting YouTube videos on Twitter and Facebook criticizing Obama sometimes, or criticizing other things.
[00:10:59.996 --> 00:11:00.236]  I don't
[00:11:20.865 --> 00:11:21.065]  I don't
[00:11:44.355 --> 00:11:49.257]  I said this could be a move towards race war or threatening one as an October surprise in the election.
[00:11:49.257 --> 00:11:55.120]  Now I'm starting to think they may be really trying to do it and that, well I'm not just starting to think it, I think that's what they're trying to do.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:56.741]  In fact, I think it's clear that's what's happening.
[00:11:56.741 --> 00:12:03.044]  I'm like 98% sure now and that's why Obama's getting all these civil emergency provisions and stuff ready.
[00:12:03.044 --> 00:12:07.206]  It is wild, so we'll talk more about that later in the transmission and tomorrow.
[00:12:07.486 --> 00:12:13.231]  Billy Corrigan, the founder of Smashing Pumpkins, is in studio with us to talk about the media, music, what's happening right now and what he sees in the future.
[00:12:13.231 --> 00:12:15.693]  Billy, great to have you in studio with us.
[00:12:15.693 --> 00:12:16.273]  Thank you, Alex.
[00:12:16.273 --> 00:12:16.694]  Happy to be here.
[00:12:35.709 --> 00:12:36.289]  Wow.
[00:12:36.289 --> 00:12:37.430]  You're here for Stop by Southwest.
[00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:38.550]  How are you liking it?
[00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:42.171]  It's a little crazy, as you know, as an Austin person.
[00:12:42.171 --> 00:12:44.812]  All of a sudden, all the beard people showed up.
[00:12:44.812 --> 00:12:46.773]  The trendies, as you call them, right?
[00:12:46.773 --> 00:12:49.153]  Lots of trendies showed up with beards and white vans.
[00:12:49.153 --> 00:12:50.294]  I did notice that.
[00:12:50.294 --> 00:12:52.775]  And like pastel pinks and greens.
[00:12:52.775 --> 00:12:53.355]  Prancing!
[00:12:54.625 --> 00:12:58.870]  I didn't see that, but I did see a lot of people like this with the cell phones, you know?
[00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:00.471]  Oh, and they walk out in front of traffic?
[00:13:00.471 --> 00:13:00.992]  Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:00.992 --> 00:13:02.674]  Well, it's good to have you here.
[00:13:02.674 --> 00:13:05.777]  Tell us about the speech you were here giving, and you had a little run-in with Al Gore.
[00:13:05.777 --> 00:13:06.538]  I did, I did.
[00:13:06.538 --> 00:13:13.565]  Well, technically speaking, I made the president, the former vice president, wait for me, which is pretty funny.
[00:13:13.565 --> 00:13:14.566]  It's a little payback for
[00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:15.587]  We're good.
[00:13:32.827 --> 00:13:32.887]  Yes.
[00:13:49.068 --> 00:13:49.268]  I don't
[00:14:06.041 --> 00:14:12.204]  It has, you know, seemed to lose that real rebel quality that you saw across the board in music just 20 years ago.
[00:14:12.204 --> 00:14:14.125]  We were talking about that at dinner last night.
[00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:14.745]  How did that happen?
[00:14:31.553 --> 00:14:37.022]  Well, I think anytime you have a corporate interest, it becomes the dominating theme.
[00:14:37.022 --> 00:14:43.433]  I mean, it's a central theme of what you talk about in your broadcasts, where corporate interest has taken over America.
[00:14:43.433 --> 00:14:45.196]  I mean, you can go back to the Founding Fathers
[00:14:46.667 --> 00:14:46.867]  I think so.
[00:15:04.059 --> 00:15:09.381]  And as you like to point out many times, America was an incredibly successful experiment for a long time.
[00:15:09.381 --> 00:15:10.362]  It evolved.
[00:15:10.362 --> 00:15:19.346]  And then somewhere along the way, we've kind of just gone like that, where corporate interest has completely taken over our political structure, and it's also taken over our musical structure.
[00:15:19.966 --> 00:15:22.449]  Where you have, I mean, yes, it's a business.
[00:15:22.449 --> 00:15:24.551]  As somebody once said, it is a music business.
[00:15:24.551 --> 00:15:36.605]  But when it is the prime driving force, well, then, of course, you're going to get into things that are salacious and, in essence, overtly negative to the culture because they're just serving a particular interest.
[00:15:36.605 --> 00:15:39.948]  And there is a point where we all have to be responsible for our community standard.
[00:15:40.569 --> 00:15:42.710]  We all have to be responsible for the messages we put out.
[00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:52.894]  I mean, I've said lots of crazy things, done a lot of crazy things, but I've always had an intention in the back of my mind that something I was doing, or the collective amount of things that I was doing, were going to help somebody somewhere.
[00:15:52.894 --> 00:15:59.577]  If your complete intention is to do nothing but profit on the backs of others, well then you know where that's gonna go.
[00:16:01.656 --> 00:16:03.357]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:16:03.357 --> 00:16:08.660]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.200]  Saving means to make money.
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:18.965]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:16:19.705 --> 00:16:27.250]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:35.255]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:16:35.255 --> 00:16:40.478]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[00:16:40.478 --> 00:16:42.640]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-

[00:17:00.347 --> 00:17:07.570]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[00:17:07.570 --> 00:17:25.459]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:17:25.459 --> 00:17:29.581]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:17:30.041 --> 00:17:39.788]  The longevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.

[00:19:00.011 --> 00:19:04.574]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:19:04.574 --> 00:19:05.495]  Number one.
[00:19:05.495 --> 00:19:08.917]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:19:08.917 --> 00:19:09.778]  Number two.
[00:19:09.778 --> 00:19:14.661]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:19:14.661 --> 00:19:15.401]  It's true.
[00:19:15.401 --> 00:19:20.285]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:19:20.285 --> 00:19:21.105]  Number three.
[00:19:21.105 --> 00:19:24.687]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:19:24.687 --> 00:19:28.370]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:19:28.590 --> 00:19:29.391]  Number 4.
[00:19:29.391 --> 00:19:32.153]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:19:32.153 --> 00:19:35.836]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:19:35.836 --> 00:19:36.617]  Number 5.
[00:19:36.617 --> 00:19:40.761]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:19:40.761 --> 00:19:45.525]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:19:45.805 --> 00:19:49.986]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[00:20:04.832 --> 00:20:08.053]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:20:10.635 --> 00:20:12.736]  The Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:12.736 --> 00:20:16.799]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[00:20:16.799 --> 00:20:18.120]  We are back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:20.882]  Thank you for joining us on this April 1st transmission.
[00:20:20.882 --> 00:20:23.704]  Sorry, we don't have any pranks for you or disinformation.
[00:20:23.704 --> 00:20:26.786]  We don't do that like the mainstream presstitute media.
[00:20:26.786 --> 00:20:32.009]  No, we just give you more exclusive interviews with the Smashing Pumpkins founder, Billy Corrigan.
[00:20:32.009 --> 00:20:32.630]  Here's some more of it.
[00:20:33.496 --> 00:20:42.983]  You mentioned the founders, and I think you really brought up a point that I've thought about a lot but never articulated, but reading their writings and what they did, they were inventors, they were really into knowledge.
[00:20:42.983 --> 00:20:52.270]  And sure, they were corporate businessmen, but they were really into the fact that we're so confident, we're so smart, we're not intimidated by other people having freedom.
[00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:55.232]  They were kind of in and talked about this wild
[00:20:56.073 --> 00:20:57.674]  Experiment of freedom.
[00:20:57.674 --> 00:21:02.098]  And you look at the corporate structures globally today, they are scared to death of any freedom.
[00:21:02.098 --> 00:21:09.523]  And so they're stifling that, and I think that's really pretty simple, but at the same time, it's complex.
[00:21:09.523 --> 00:21:17.229]  Well, I think from a political standpoint, anywhere where you see dissent being stifled, where's the fear?
[00:21:17.229 --> 00:21:20.012]  Or should I say, why is the fear there?
[00:21:21.724 --> 00:21:28.308]  Most people I talk to that would say have a problem with the government, they don't sit around and talk about anarchy or overthrowing the government.
[00:21:28.308 --> 00:21:34.971]  They just want to see a government that represents their sort of community value.
[00:21:34.971 --> 00:21:37.572]  And I'm not necessarily one side or the other.
[00:21:37.572 --> 00:21:41.854]  You know, I've got people in my family that are total right-wing Republicans.
[00:21:41.854 --> 00:21:44.095]  Some of them are probably even racist.
[00:21:44.095 --> 00:21:49.298]  But they at least have a particular opinion that they're coming from that is rooted in their own belief system.
[00:21:49.878 --> 00:21:55.041]  When all you have is corporate interests driving something, well then it's got nothing to do with belief.
[00:21:55.041 --> 00:22:01.846]  It's about looking at you and saying, how can I strip this man, or this woman, or this family of their resources?
[00:22:01.846 --> 00:22:14.014]  And that particular aspect is sort of haunting to us as Americans, because even if we were raised in propaganda, which you and I probably were, we were at least raised to believe America's a great country, it represents these values,
[00:22:14.634 --> 00:22:16.276]  You know, we freed the slaves.
[00:22:16.276 --> 00:22:19.661]  We, you know, we helped stop the Holocaust.
[00:22:19.661 --> 00:22:23.767]  You know, we grew up with a sense of personal ethic about what our country represented.
[00:22:23.767 --> 00:22:26.130]  The corporate globalism is so cold-blooded.
[00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:27.612]  It's so robotic.
[00:22:27.612 --> 00:22:27.972]  Well, yeah.
[00:22:28.965 --> 00:22:32.389]  And I mean, you address it with great frequency.
[00:22:32.389 --> 00:22:36.553]  And I think, I use that word again, there's sort of a haunting feeling.
[00:22:36.553 --> 00:22:37.854]  It's like, I get it.
[00:22:37.854 --> 00:22:39.136]  I get you want to make money.
[00:22:39.136 --> 00:22:41.218]  I get you want to sell me something.
[00:22:41.218 --> 00:22:46.623]  But when it's at the expense of my community, when it's at the expense of the values of the people around me,
[00:22:47.384 --> 00:22:57.828]  And, you know, people don't even talk to their neighbors and they're all so locked into this, we talked about last night, kind of a narcoleptic state where the TV is enough or the computer is enough.
[00:22:57.828 --> 00:23:06.432]  That's a scary thing, you know, and so there is a connection there between kind of stifling dissent.
[00:23:07.772 --> 00:23:10.215]  You know, what did Obama say coming in?
[00:23:10.215 --> 00:23:12.877]  I want to run this great, open government.
[00:23:12.877 --> 00:23:14.839]  Transparent was, I believe, the word they used.
[00:23:14.839 --> 00:23:18.623]  And now you've seen where they go out of their way to stifle dissent.
[00:23:18.623 --> 00:23:20.224]  It's the most closed government.
[00:23:20.224 --> 00:23:20.525]  Right.
[00:23:20.525 --> 00:23:31.816]  But what I say from an artistic point of view, and as somebody who's been in the media and at the top levels of media, and of course I know plenty of things that go on behind the scenes, why are we so afraid of that dissent?
[00:23:32.301 --> 00:23:33.822]  You know, what is the problem?
[00:23:33.822 --> 00:23:35.364]  I mean, isn't that the point of a democracy?
[00:23:35.364 --> 00:23:39.247]  You're supposed to have a kind of a riotous debate about who's right.
[00:23:39.247 --> 00:23:40.869]  It should be an uncomfortable conversation.
[00:23:40.869 --> 00:23:43.591]  There should be kind of a... That's the whole point.
[00:23:43.591 --> 00:23:43.952]  Exactly.
[00:23:43.952 --> 00:23:46.994]  They're always saying, well, you can have your free speech as long as it's not uncomfortable.
[00:23:46.994 --> 00:23:53.540]  Or as long as it's 300 feet down the road, away from where the limos go in the back door, you know?
[00:23:54.501 --> 00:23:56.282]  But it is the uncomfortable speech.
[00:23:56.282 --> 00:23:57.542]  That's what's really important.
[00:23:57.542 --> 00:23:59.383]  Yes, and that's why I appreciate what you're doing.
[00:23:59.383 --> 00:24:07.485]  I think you raise a lot of points that are uncomfortable, but they're necessary towards the greater dialogue about where our country is at the moment and where it's going.
[00:24:07.485 --> 00:24:15.148]  And, of course, as alternative media, which you're a pioneer in, as it reveals a different narrative than we've been sold,
[00:24:15.768 --> 00:24:23.592]  There's an awareness and awakening that goes on because you start looking at history and go, okay, wait a second, that thing I was told about this, maybe that's not so true.
[00:24:23.592 --> 00:24:27.014]  And then you start looking at things from a different point of evaluation.
[00:24:27.014 --> 00:24:31.716]  I think the biggest mistake we all make is trying to find a form of absolutism.
[00:24:31.716 --> 00:24:33.017]  There is no one truth.
[00:24:33.017 --> 00:24:36.338]  There is no one definitive black and white answer.
[00:24:36.338 --> 00:24:40.320]  There's this fear that's rising up around the discussion.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:41.501]  And that, to me, that's a big red flag.
[00:24:43.956 --> 00:24:47.518]  Well, the system knows that it consolidates power.
[00:24:47.518 --> 00:24:50.720]  People subconsciously are smart and understand there's a threat.
[00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:58.965]  So the system is very adept at projecting people's natural anxiety over things going in the wrong direction onto some boogeyman.
[00:24:58.965 --> 00:25:02.767]  And the social engineers, they know that.
[00:25:02.767 --> 00:25:05.029]  We talked a lot when we went to dinner last night.
[00:25:06.172 --> 00:25:10.096]  Billy, about media tricks, or trying to keep people in the box.
[00:25:10.096 --> 00:25:15.542]  And, you know, when you were speaking about it, you know, all these data points were coming to my mind.
[00:25:15.542 --> 00:25:20.427]  You were absolutely on target with how they're trying to control reality.
[00:25:20.427 --> 00:25:20.928]  Speak to that.
[00:25:21.874 --> 00:25:24.796]  Well, I can use my own example.
[00:25:24.796 --> 00:25:28.358]  You know, I'm essentially lower middle class.
[00:25:28.358 --> 00:25:31.339]  No one from my family went to college.
[00:25:31.339 --> 00:25:34.281]  I obviously have some gifts that are valuable.
[00:25:34.281 --> 00:25:40.104]  The minute I entered into a bigger, wider swath of media, I was sort of categorized.
[00:25:40.104 --> 00:25:43.066]  And when I resisted the categorization, I was demonized.
[00:25:43.817 --> 00:25:46.319]  You know, now somebody would say, well, that's just rock and roll.
[00:25:46.319 --> 00:25:53.466]  But having been in that game for 20 years, there's this overt pressure to put yourself in that particular narrative.
[00:25:53.466 --> 00:25:57.170]  And if you won't, you will be sort of labeled intact.
[00:25:57.170 --> 00:26:05.598]  And it's fascinating for me now to go back and read articles about myself from 18 years ago where I'm sort of being put into categories and labeled a certain way.
[00:26:06.358 --> 00:26:14.581]  And then it's that weird thing, it's like Kafka, you know, you're accused of a crime, you don't know what you did that was so wrong, and then you spend the rest of your life defending it.
[00:26:14.581 --> 00:26:22.423]  And so I'm very keen to watch how other people are demonized from media entry points.
[00:26:22.423 --> 00:26:33.367]  When somebody rises up with a brand new idea, the way it's either co-opted, you know, like, let's assume, for the sake of argument, that the Occupy Movement started as an organic
[00:26:34.227 --> 00:26:36.967]  You know, somebody said, let's do this.
[00:26:36.967 --> 00:26:38.608]  Ten people, four people.
[00:26:38.608 --> 00:26:42.108]  You saw right away where it was co-opted.
[00:26:42.108 --> 00:26:45.849]  Or other media forces tried to disclaim it and distance.
[00:26:45.849 --> 00:26:51.190]  And those are the ways that the media sort of tries to take things that they can't control and put it in a box.
[00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:52.830]  And then they start to write the articles.
[00:26:52.830 --> 00:26:55.911]  What does this mean?
[00:26:55.911 --> 00:27:01.072]  Bloomberg comes out and says, Occupy New York is bad for business.
[00:27:01.072 --> 00:27:03.292]  So the comment person says, oh, that's hurting us.
[00:27:04.161 --> 00:27:09.905]  Well, in the greater expression of freedom, maybe it's a good thing that we're having this dissent.
[00:27:09.905 --> 00:27:16.070]  Maybe the small downside of blocking traffic or something in the greater whole is a necessity.
[00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.611]  Exactly.
[00:27:16.611 --> 00:27:24.617]  I mean, if America, 5% of the world population, developed half the wealth because it had more freedom than anybody else, not that we were perfect, then how is
[00:27:25.257 --> 00:27:27.940]  It bad that people are exercising their liberty.
[00:27:27.940 --> 00:27:31.903]  Even if they don't have all the answers, at least they're trying to get involved.
[00:27:31.903 --> 00:27:35.606]  So the real question is, why is Bloomberg demonizing it?
[00:27:35.606 --> 00:27:41.832]  Or the way Homeland Security coordinated to try to take down everybody's protests, you know?
[00:27:41.832 --> 00:27:44.855]  I think those are all a really big red flag.
[00:27:44.855 --> 00:27:49.319]  Why are they so scared of people even exercising their First Amendment?
[00:27:49.798 --> 00:27:53.202]  That's a question I don't have the answer for.
[00:27:53.202 --> 00:28:11.421]  I think it's one of those things where you can only look at the reaction to gauge that there must be really something vital going on or there wouldn't have been such a violent reaction against the Occupy Movement if what the Occupy Movement was representing as a whole wasn't threatening to somebody.
[00:28:11.761 --> 00:28:15.763]  You know, and that's why they try to sort of categorize it down into boxes.
[00:28:15.763 --> 00:28:17.765]  It's bad for business.
[00:28:17.765 --> 00:28:19.305]  It could lead to violence.
[00:28:19.305 --> 00:28:21.026]  It hasn't yet, but it might.
[00:28:21.026 --> 00:28:23.668]  You know, this kind of implied nuance.
[00:28:23.668 --> 00:28:31.132]  Yet, it was mostly just a bunch of people in tents, you know, and I particularly didn't agree with all of the Occupy message.
[00:28:31.132 --> 00:28:33.334]  I'm not here to wave the flag for it.
[00:28:33.334 --> 00:28:38.777]  I think there's certain aspects of troubling, troubling aspects about it, particularly the idea of wealth distribution.
[00:28:39.457 --> 00:28:44.298]  You know, in my particular instance, you know, I came from a family that didn't have anything.
[00:28:44.298 --> 00:28:48.720]  Everything I've earned in life, I made myself with songs that I wrote.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:54.761]  So when somebody starts talking about how I've got to give to somebody that didn't do that, well, that's a deeper conversation.
[00:28:54.761 --> 00:28:56.442]  It doesn't mean I don't have a social concern.
[00:28:56.442 --> 00:28:58.522]  It doesn't mean I don't want to contribute to charities.
[00:28:58.522 --> 00:29:00.183]  It doesn't mean I don't want to help my fellow man.
[00:29:02.401 --> 00:29:06.362]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:29:06.362 --> 00:29:15.225]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[00:29:15.225 --> 00:29:19.846]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[00:29:19.846 --> 00:29:30.669]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[00:29:31.309 --> 00:29:40.811]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless cloyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[00:29:40.811 --> 00:29:46.253]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.

[00:29:53.734 --> 00:29:56.475]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[00:30:00.896 --> 00:30:01.957]  I had tried everything.
[00:30:01.957 --> 00:30:07.442]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:30:07.442 --> 00:30:12.267]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:30:12.267 --> 00:30:18.653]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:30:19.133 --> 00:30:30.339]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:30:30.339 --> 00:30:34.822]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[00:30:34.822 --> 00:30:41.085]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:30:41.085 --> 00:30:42.226]  Now, that's results.

[00:31:01.658 --> 00:31:07.245]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:31:07.245 --> 00:31:12.272]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:31:12.272 --> 00:31:17.318]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[00:31:17.839 --> 00:31:23.060]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:25.381]  They call it a survival seed bank.

[00:31:44.727 --> 00:31:47.968]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:31:47.968 --> 00:31:49.689]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[00:32:00.703 --> 00:32:05.687]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.

[00:33:04.977 --> 00:33:10.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:14.722]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:33:14.722 --> 00:33:16.463]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:19.116 --> 00:33:24.892]  Alright folks, coming up, Dave Mustaine, David Icke, the Prometheus Review, and more!
[00:33:30.089 --> 00:33:41.757]  Billy, you were telling me last night that more and more you realize that the answer to just pure, empty commercialism, to put words in your mouth, is a spiritual understanding.
[00:33:41.757 --> 00:33:50.923]  Of course, you're not going to find that in a church or in some box, but, I mean, for you, your spiritual walk, your spiritual awakening, I tend to agree with you.
[00:33:50.923 --> 00:33:57.048]  I think that's really the answer to this artificial system is people tuning in to the fact that we're in a limitless
[00:33:58.008 --> 00:34:09.898]  Yeah, I find it inspiring sometimes when you talk about how when you're not really sure what to do, you go outside and look at the stars and you become, you know, integrated with the cosmos, you realize your place in it.
[00:34:09.898 --> 00:34:12.661]  And I think that's what we all have to do.
[00:34:12.661 --> 00:34:15.063]  We can't be so selfish as to not consider others.
[00:34:15.883 --> 00:34:21.185]  We can't be so selfish as to not think that what we do in irresponsibility doesn't have an impact on somebody else.
[00:34:21.185 --> 00:34:29.689]  You know, there's that, you've seen the commercial or the thing in the movie where the guy knocks over the bottle and somehow it's 14 steps down and, you know, somebody gets hit by a bus or something.
[00:34:29.689 --> 00:34:36.292]  There is a continuity in quantum physics to what we do, the power of intention, the laws of attraction.
[00:34:36.292 --> 00:34:43.415]  And I think, you know, and it's by no means a criticism but we discussed it in terms of your program, I think that
[00:34:44.315 --> 00:34:44.655]  I think?
[00:35:08.993 --> 00:35:09.133]  Yes.
[00:35:09.133 --> 00:35:13.714]  So a return to constitutional values, emphasis on liberty and freedom, not being afraid of innovation and new ideas, rigorous debate.
[00:35:13.714 --> 00:35:14.794]  But what does that look like?
[00:35:14.794 --> 00:35:18.295]  Let's say we could wave a magic wand and we have the democracy that we can be proud of.
[00:35:37.598 --> 00:35:39.799]  What does that look like in 2012?
[00:35:39.799 --> 00:35:44.322]  I think we need to start focusing on that because the power of intention is strong.
[00:35:44.322 --> 00:35:50.625]  You know, we have to see what happiness looks like and we'll know where to go left and right as we walk down this path.
[00:35:50.625 --> 00:35:51.165]  I agree with you.
[00:35:51.165 --> 00:35:56.348]  That's the biggest part I'm missing is I'm just trying to get people to wake up and see the attack we're under.
[00:35:56.348 --> 00:35:57.549]  But you're right.
[00:35:57.549 --> 00:36:00.130]  You've got to have something to sell against that.
[00:36:00.951 --> 00:36:01.591]  Right.
[00:36:01.591 --> 00:36:04.694]  And I see interesting things.
[00:36:04.694 --> 00:36:07.736]  I see where people are doing co-op farming.
[00:36:07.736 --> 00:36:09.378]  People are forming collectives.
[00:36:09.378 --> 00:36:10.959]  People are getting together to pray.
[00:36:10.959 --> 00:36:13.541]  They're forming their own churches.
[00:36:13.541 --> 00:36:16.304]  If they don't trust their own church, they say, well, let's just have our own church.
[00:36:16.644 --> 00:36:18.125]  Doesn't matter what denomination.
[00:36:18.125 --> 00:36:19.905]  Exactly, and they're creating their own media.
[00:36:19.905 --> 00:36:24.747]  And if you look at it, we were talking to the car today, they're attacking the individual farms and co-ops here in Austin.
[00:36:24.747 --> 00:36:27.448]  People buying their own cows, sharing on their own farms.
[00:36:27.448 --> 00:36:30.148]  The feds and state are freaking out.
[00:36:30.148 --> 00:36:33.890]  All over the country, people are starting home churches, different denominations, different religions.
[00:36:33.890 --> 00:36:35.750]  They're shutting them down with zoning.
[00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:40.912]  Hasn't there been some community passed a law where you can't have more than two people together to
[00:36:41.232 --> 00:36:47.213]  Yeah, California and areas of California, but I mean, Colorado, but you're right.
[00:36:47.213 --> 00:36:49.994]  You're not allowed to assemble in your own house now.
[00:36:49.994 --> 00:36:51.414]  It was some sort of weird law like that, right?
[00:36:51.414 --> 00:36:55.815]  Exactly, the reason I'm gibbering in excitement is you're absolutely right.
[00:36:55.815 --> 00:37:00.076]  The system shows us what's powerful by what they freak out by.
[00:37:00.076 --> 00:37:05.777]  And they're going after Amish, they're going after home churches, they're going after backyard gardens.
[00:37:05.777 --> 00:37:09.338]  Hey, why do you think there's been a suppression of Native Americans all these years?
[00:37:09.958 --> 00:37:18.063]  The Native Americans is one of the richest, most incredibly beautiful cultures ever created on the face of the earth.
[00:37:18.063 --> 00:37:23.886]  Whether you're talking about the Maoris or, you know, I mean, the Aboriginals in Australia.
[00:37:23.886 --> 00:37:28.009]  I mean, these people in many ways hold the key to our success.
[00:37:28.009 --> 00:37:31.091]  And those are values that I really resonate to.
[00:37:31.091 --> 00:37:33.412]  They're independent, they're not commercial, they're the enemy.
[00:37:33.712 --> 00:37:42.400]  So we need to, as a culture, as a people who care about liberty, care about freedom, care about the future of our country, we need to start setting that intention.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:50.747]  And we're never going to go, unless something horrible happens, I mean, you know, the iPad's a part of our life, the cell phone's a part of our life.
[00:37:50.747 --> 00:37:51.628]  So what does that mean?
[00:37:51.628 --> 00:37:53.790]  How can we use technology in the right ways?
[00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:55.551]  How can you be an independent reporter?
[00:37:55.551 --> 00:37:57.833]  How can you create your own systems?
[00:37:57.833 --> 00:38:00.656]  How can people create their own systems to connect people together?
[00:38:00.876 --> 00:38:04.458]  How can you use the systems that are in place, the Facebooks and the Google Pluses?
[00:38:04.458 --> 00:38:06.179]  How can you use that to your advantage?
[00:38:06.179 --> 00:38:12.263]  If those systems are going to be there, you know what I mean, instead of just plugging your fingers in your ear, well, how can you use that to your advantage?
[00:38:12.263 --> 00:38:12.864]  Well, I agree.
[00:38:12.864 --> 00:38:17.386]  You're going to be spied on, but... But a lot of people say, don't use any of the system.
[00:38:17.386 --> 00:38:18.807]  I say, do both.
[00:38:18.807 --> 00:38:26.312]  Build an alternative system and come out of the Babylon, but at the same time, go into the Matrix and use its own system against it.
[00:38:26.312 --> 00:38:27.053]  You know, do both.
[00:38:27.913 --> 00:38:32.296]  I can, having been inside the music business, I can agree with you on that.
[00:38:32.296 --> 00:38:33.476]  Well, I have to say this.
[00:38:33.476 --> 00:38:37.479]  I have seen an exponential awakening, because I don't claim to be the best at what I do.
[00:38:37.479 --> 00:38:42.521]  I mean, it's the imperfectness, though, that basically fits into the larger whole.
[00:38:42.521 --> 00:38:53.448]  I have seen my own personal success reaching tens of millions of people, and there are so many others that are more articulate, who have greater gifts than I, and I'm seeing them come online, and I know that in that
[00:38:53.988 --> 00:38:57.191]  True diversity, that's what the corporate board can't stop.
[00:38:57.191 --> 00:39:01.294]  They can play whack-a-mole all day long, but they can't stop the signal.
[00:39:01.294 --> 00:39:04.316]  Yeah, and this is what I would say in conclusion.
[00:39:04.316 --> 00:39:14.083]  Even if you, Alex Jones, were wrong about everything you ever opined, even if you were wrong, the fact that you were willing to put those ideas to create that debate, that is the key.
[00:39:14.884 --> 00:39:18.086]  That's why people shouldn't be so scared of those ideas.
[00:39:18.086 --> 00:39:20.928]  And that is the key to our future, I think.
[00:39:20.928 --> 00:39:23.570]  It's not about whether or not you're right, I'm wrong.
[00:39:23.570 --> 00:39:32.336]  That is the system that's put there in our psychology by people who want to control our individual intuitive systems.
[00:39:33.197 --> 00:39:36.839]  Because at the end of the day, look, people can sit here and watch us talk for an hour.
[00:39:36.839 --> 00:39:39.921]  If they think we're wrong, great!
[00:39:39.921 --> 00:39:42.723]  If it's coming from their own heart.
[00:39:42.723 --> 00:39:50.828]  If people sit here and watch us and they say, these guys don't really know what they're talking about, and that's coming from inside them, that's God speaking through them.
[00:39:50.828 --> 00:39:52.469]  And maybe we are wrong.
[00:39:52.469 --> 00:39:57.552]  That's perfectly fine if it's coming from their own internal system of intuition.
[00:39:57.552 --> 00:40:01.075]  If they're buying a corporate narrative that convinces a
[00:40:02.145 --> 00:40:07.348]  Convinces them that we're wrong just because we're opening our mouths and we're questioning something.
[00:40:07.348 --> 00:40:08.849]  That should scare them.
[00:40:08.849 --> 00:40:10.150]  Because that means they're robots.
[00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:15.233]  That means they've been controlled by somebody along... They're actually not... They're not thinking their own thoughts, they're thinking somebody else.
[00:40:15.233 --> 00:40:16.413]  And that's Orwellian.
[00:40:16.413 --> 00:40:17.374]  And that should frighten them.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:18.841]  What about this point?
[00:40:18.841 --> 00:40:23.887]  I find a lot of people say, you're probably right about this, but what are you going to do about it?
[00:40:23.887 --> 00:40:25.389]  I choose to join the system.
[00:40:25.389 --> 00:40:29.775]  They think it's like joining the winning team or a bandwagon.
[00:40:29.775 --> 00:40:33.920]  When a team's going to the Super Bowl, well then they buy the jersey or the t-shirt.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:37.124]  It's almost like they think they can join with this inhuman
[00:40:37.944 --> 00:40:40.846]  Any system that's devoid of true leadership is troubling.
[00:41:03.582 --> 00:41:08.966]  And so when I see that in people where they just accept an idea without actually having their own internal debate.
[00:41:08.966 --> 00:41:15.111]  I mean, we've all been in those dinner conversations where you just kind of throw something out in the middle of the table and somebody goes, no.
[00:41:15.111 --> 00:41:16.853]  And you go, well, where did you get that from?
[00:41:16.853 --> 00:41:20.336]  Well, I was listening to, you know, Oprah or something.
[00:41:20.336 --> 00:41:21.176]  You know what I mean?
[00:41:21.176 --> 00:41:22.737]  They didn't actually have the thought.
[00:41:22.737 --> 00:41:25.259]  They heard somebody else express it and they go, I agree with that.
[00:41:25.259 --> 00:41:25.960]  And they repeat it.
[00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.882]  But sometimes it's worse than that.
[00:41:27.882 --> 00:41:30.003]  They say, I hear what you're saying.
[00:41:30.003 --> 00:41:31.124]  I've talked to engineers.
[00:41:32.325 --> 00:41:41.068]  One time I was out camping, you know, at our family, you know, ranch, and I wasn't deer hunting, but we had some deer hunters there leasing the property, and they were all engineers.
[00:41:41.068 --> 00:41:45.369]  And I said, well, they found two of the passports in the rubble that day.
[00:41:45.369 --> 00:41:47.550]  That's impossible.
[00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:52.391]  And they said, I hear what you're saying, but as an article of faith, I can't believe that.
[00:41:52.831 --> 00:41:54.552]  And I was just like, well that's crazy.
[00:41:54.552 --> 00:42:02.476]  But see, the way I look at stuff like that is, if somebody needs to believe something for themselves, that's fine for themselves.
[00:42:02.476 --> 00:42:03.416]  That's okay.
[00:42:03.416 --> 00:42:08.639]  Because trying to convince somebody of something that they don't want to believe is sort of a fruitless effort anyway.
[00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:09.079]  Yeah.
[00:42:28.595 --> 00:42:28.995]  I totally agree.
[00:42:28.995 --> 00:42:34.218]  So many people go and speak to their family or whatever, and they get brushed off and think, well, I'm done trying to wake people up politically, spiritually.
[00:42:34.218 --> 00:42:39.160]  There's always going to be the mass of people that just want to be followers, that don't want to hear anything complex, that just want to go
[00:42:57.188 --> 00:43:01.030]  Cook your TV dinner and watch Dancing with the Stars.
[00:43:01.030 --> 00:43:07.673]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[00:43:07.673 --> 00:43:12.836]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[00:43:12.836 --> 00:43:21.560]  There's a place down in Tennessee, where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:23.921]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[00:43:25.612 --> 00:43:27.820]  Guarantee you love the way they fit.
[00:43:30.049 --> 00:43:34.651]  They put a Diamond Gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[00:43:34.651 --> 00:43:39.713]  Blue Diamond Gussets got it, others don't.
[00:43:39.713 --> 00:43:41.854]  We turn jeans inside out.
[00:43:41.854 --> 00:43:43.635]  Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[00:43:43.635 --> 00:43:46.516]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[00:43:46.516 --> 00:43:53.158]  Our Defender Motorcycle Jeans combine Gusset comfort with Kevlar protection, so you can ride all day with confidence.
[00:43:53.158 --> 00:43:55.859]  Order yours at gusset.com.
[00:43:55.859 --> 00:43:59.081]  Diamond Gusset Jeans got it, others don't.
[00:44:00.345 --> 00:44:07.569]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, I was still starving.
[00:44:07.569 --> 00:44:25.459]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[00:44:25.459 --> 00:44:29.581]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[00:44:29.841 --> 00:44:31.622]  And discovered Young-Jevity.
[00:44:31.622 --> 00:44:39.788]  The Young-Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need, and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[00:44:39.788 --> 00:44:46.092]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[00:44:46.092 --> 00:44:47.373]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:44:47.373 --> 00:44:48.253]  It's incredible.
[00:44:48.253 --> 00:44:57.460]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.301]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[00:45:00.101 --> 00:45:04.663]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:45:04.663 --> 00:45:05.563]  Number one.
[00:45:05.563 --> 00:45:09.005]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:45:09.005 --> 00:45:09.865]  Number two.
[00:45:09.865 --> 00:45:14.747]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:45:14.747 --> 00:45:15.487]  It's true.
[00:45:15.487 --> 00:45:20.369]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:45:20.369 --> 00:45:21.189]  Number three.
[00:45:21.189 --> 00:45:24.771]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:45:24.771 --> 00:45:28.472]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:45:28.672 --> 00:45:29.473]  Number 4.
[00:45:29.473 --> 00:45:32.236]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:45:32.236 --> 00:45:35.920]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:36.721]  Number 5.
[00:45:36.721 --> 00:45:40.866]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:45:40.866 --> 00:45:45.631]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[00:45:45.911 --> 00:45:50.075]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[00:45:50.075 --> 00:45:51.857]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[00:45:51.857 --> 00:45:54.119]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[00:46:01.007 --> 00:46:02.708]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:46:02.708 --> 00:46:08.010]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:09.550]  Saving means to make money.
[00:46:09.550 --> 00:46:18.334]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:46:19.074 --> 00:46:26.596]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:46:26.596 --> 00:46:34.598]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:46:34.598 --> 00:46:39.840]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:47:02.993 --> 00:47:05.034]  Direct from Austin.
[00:47:05.034 --> 00:47:08.256]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[00:47:15.367 --> 00:47:19.450]  I love that sound.
[00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:32.580]  Alright my friends, Alex Jones back with you here.
[00:47:32.580 --> 00:47:36.163]  Thank you for joining us on this April 1st 2012 transmission.
[00:47:36.163 --> 00:47:38.845]  Hard to believe we're already into the fourth month of 2012.
[00:47:42.048 --> 00:47:44.490]  Now, I'm a big Ridley Scott fan.
[00:47:44.490 --> 00:47:51.797]  I want to make that clear here, and I think I say that in the news piece we're about to premiere here for the radio audience, The Secrets of Prometheus.
[00:47:51.797 --> 00:48:00.286]  If you want to see the video going along with the audio, just go to InfoWars.com, and this little 8-minute special report is posted right there.
[00:48:00.286 --> 00:48:02.288]  But I want to be clear about something here.
[00:48:02.288 --> 00:48:06.752]  What I'm about to present here, I do not believe, because I can't prove it one way or the other.
[00:48:06.932 --> 00:48:16.215]  What I can prove is that every ancient society thought they were being visited by star gods who were coming to this planet and manipulating human development.
[00:48:16.215 --> 00:48:17.215]  Every culture.
[00:48:17.215 --> 00:48:21.336]  Aztecs, Romans, Greeks, Babylonians, Japanese.
[00:48:21.336 --> 00:48:22.557]  I mean, every culture.
[00:48:22.557 --> 00:48:23.917]  I don't know if that's true or not.
[00:48:23.917 --> 00:48:36.581]  All I know is the elite, the secret societies today, in all of my deep research, I run into the fact that they believe they are being directed by off-world intelligences and that humans were genetically engineered.
[00:48:36.761 --> 00:48:39.143]  That is the secret of the movie Prometheus coming out.
[00:48:39.143 --> 00:48:40.685]  I've got some inside leaks and stuff.
[00:48:40.685 --> 00:48:42.527]  I'm not going to spoil the thing for you.
[00:48:42.527 --> 00:48:47.031]  But the point is, this is not seen as fiction by many top globalists.
[00:48:47.031 --> 00:48:54.959]  And knowing what's in the film, with my contacts, this film is one of the closest representations of what the ruling elite actually think.
[00:48:54.959 --> 00:48:56.961]  So it's part of the revelation of the method.
[00:48:56.961 --> 00:49:01.385]  And you see this in so many films, and Steven Spielberg, there's an obsession with it.
[00:49:01.485 --> 00:49:03.186]  We know there's Project Bluebeam.
[00:49:03.186 --> 00:49:08.928]  The government admits they have plans to stage alien landings and other stuff to make people submit during crises.
[00:49:08.928 --> 00:49:12.170]  They have plans to project Jesus or Buddha or Muhammad into the air.
[00:49:12.170 --> 00:49:13.851]  I mean, that's all been declassified.
[00:49:13.851 --> 00:49:17.873]  The fact that they have those plans, the details are classified.
[00:49:17.873 --> 00:49:20.434]  But the fact that the plans are there is declassified.
[00:49:20.434 --> 00:49:24.636]  Kind of like genetic engineering cloning they now admit has been going on for 30 years.
[00:49:24.636 --> 00:49:27.457]  It was classified, now it's not, but details are still classified.
[00:49:27.777 --> 00:49:34.445]  So here for the radio audience on this Sunday transmission is the inside scoop, the secrets.
[00:49:34.445 --> 00:49:36.568]  So here it is.
[00:49:36.568 --> 00:49:46.580]  Ridley Scott, arguably one of the greatest living directors, is set to release a prequel to his 1979 mega-hit, Alien, Prometheus.
[00:49:47.719 --> 00:49:51.824]  One of the most anticipated sci-fi films in recent memory.
[00:49:51.824 --> 00:50:04.620]  InfoWars.com research analysis shows, Prometheus is not just a film, but a revelation of the method, revealing the deepest secrets of the Illuminati mystery religion.
[00:50:08.365 --> 00:50:24.654]  I do have a lot of contacts in the media as viewers and listeners know, and I have been able to secure a copy of an early script, and it follows very closely from the trailer I've seen in other leaks.
[00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:29.037]  I'm not going to give the entire film away here, but in synopsis,
[00:50:30.478 --> 00:50:47.553]  This is a film about the origins of humankind with a super race of near-immortal genetic engineers who are contemplating a genetic overwrite or rewrite of the planet Earth.
[00:50:47.553 --> 00:50:54.980]  When meddling humans stumble in to the magician's laboratory, they are punished for their trespass.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:55.881]  It was so wrong.
[00:50:56.926 --> 00:51:12.372]  The so-called space jockey is the advanced species that have engineered humans back on Earth and produced the bio-weapon that we know of as the classical alien that burst out of your chest after feeding on the food in your intestines.
[00:51:12.372 --> 00:51:21.055]  The reason we're taking time out to examine Prometheus is because its storyline, its plot, mirrors that of many ancient societies.
[00:51:21.895 --> 00:51:27.797]  And the ideas presented in Prometheus are at the core of Western secret societies.
[00:51:27.797 --> 00:51:31.579]  These are ancient civilizations that were separated by centuries.
[00:51:31.579 --> 00:51:35.180]  And yet, this same pictogram was discovered in every one of them.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.801]  Please tell me you can read that.
[00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:47.024]  Across the world, we see evidence of early civilizations' obsession with what they believed were off-world influences.
[00:51:47.024 --> 00:51:53.266]  From the Nazca Lines in South America to the pyramids of Egypt, we see artifacts.
[00:51:53.266 --> 00:51:58.649]  Testament to early man's obsession with off-world manipulators.
[00:51:59.569 --> 00:52:05.413]  Every ancient culture believed they were communicating with men from the sky.
[00:52:05.413 --> 00:52:17.341]  Ezekiel with spinning wheels of fire landing and creatures with blue space helmets approaching Ezekiel and giving him a drug to take and then he has wild hallucinations.
[00:52:17.341 --> 00:52:25.987]  One could say that Prometheus is simply art imitating life and putting a 21st century spin on the beliefs of the Dogon tribe in Africa.
[00:52:26.687 --> 00:52:29.329]  ...and the Aztecs of Mesoamerica.
[00:52:29.329 --> 00:52:42.859]  Eric Von Donaghan, more than any other living person, has popularized the idea of chariots of the gods, and that our planet has been visited and manipulated by off-world creatures for thousands of years.
[00:52:42.859 --> 00:52:51.705]  But the systems that he popularized were regurgitated whole cloth from ideas developed by the ruling class of this planet.
[00:52:51.705 --> 00:52:52.385]  And I want to be clear.
[00:52:53.467 --> 00:53:03.645]  Every major globalist we look at, going back more than 160 years, is completely and totally obsessed with the idea
[00:53:04.670 --> 00:53:10.734]  That off-world aliens are controlling this planet and giving them hidden knowledge.
[00:53:10.734 --> 00:53:13.075]  By the 1870s, T.H.
[00:53:13.075 --> 00:53:18.638]  Huxley Group and their X-Club was dominating the Royal Society in England.
[00:53:18.638 --> 00:53:27.224]  The dominant theory within the X-Club was that humans had been seeded here, along with most other lifeforms, by advanced beings from space.
[00:53:28.104 --> 00:53:38.729]  From the inception of Darwin's theory on the origin of species, evolutionary scientists never believed for a minute that life simply started on its own.
[00:53:38.729 --> 00:53:50.174]  That evolution is not some random, slow system developing by chance, but is actually directed by off-world seeders, terra-farmers, creators of worlds.
[00:53:50.934 --> 00:54:01.903]  Even the discoverer of DNA, Francis Crick, promotes the idea that life was seeded on this planet in what he calls directed panspermia.
[00:54:01.903 --> 00:54:05.586]  It is part of the larger myth of transhumanism.
[00:54:05.586 --> 00:54:18.497]  Huxley, Darwin, Wedgwood, the Galtans, they all interbred in an attempt to create this transcendent Superman, the governing class of this globe.
[00:54:19.577 --> 00:54:30.844]  ...believes that they are channeling advanced technological systems given to them by ancient alien species.
[00:54:30.844 --> 00:54:37.688]  And the science fiction of the last 150 years, whether it's Jules Verne or H.G.
[00:54:37.688 --> 00:54:39.349]  Wells or those that came before them,
[00:54:40.189 --> 00:54:42.050]  We can create cybernetic individuals.
[00:55:11.170 --> 00:55:12.973]  Are the gods now?
[00:55:12.973 --> 00:55:20.502]  Blurring the lines between fiction and reality, we see a futuristic presentation of the technology conference TED.
[00:55:20.502 --> 00:55:25.529]  The keynote speaker is the founder of the Weyland Corporation, Mr. Weyland.
[00:55:25.529 --> 00:55:28.632]  There he describes Prometheus stealing fire from the gods.
[00:55:29.275 --> 00:55:31.236]  From the titan, Prometheus.
[00:55:31.236 --> 00:55:33.558]  Our first true piece of technology.
[00:55:33.558 --> 00:55:34.299]  Fire.
[00:55:34.299 --> 00:55:41.004]  The transference of fire, or the first technology to man, is only the beginning of his transgressions.
[00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:50.270]  Prometheus is a titan, and the creator of mankind, who attempts to elevate humans to the level of gods, and is punished.
[00:55:50.270 --> 00:55:56.275]  The Illuminati believe they have stolen the fire of true genius from the gods.
[00:55:56.926 --> 00:55:59.611]  Biotech, nanotech, fusion.
[00:55:59.611 --> 00:56:07.344]  As man attempts to become godlike, we release potential forces that can and probably will destroy us.
[00:56:07.344 --> 00:56:09.167]  I want to say this in summation.
[00:56:10.469 --> 00:56:17.072]  We're not facing off-world genetic engineers that the elite believes created this planet, whether that's true or not.
[00:56:17.072 --> 00:56:32.158]  We're facing the global technocrats that are splicing every plant and animal and insect you can imagine together, that are creating chimeras with hundreds of species within them, giving rise to superviruses and bacterial mutations.
[00:56:33.218 --> 00:56:42.785]  We are already seeing within three generations in rodents total sterilization and massive deformities in these animals.
[00:56:42.785 --> 00:56:52.513]  And we have proven from the Rockefeller Foundation documents and other reports that this is part of a long-term program to wreck the general public's DNA.
[00:56:52.513 --> 00:56:58.457]  This is the global elite who have fantasized about off-world genetic engineers creating them
[00:56:59.198 --> 00:57:07.123]  Actually, in a 160 year plus program, developing the sciences and technologies to put this into place.
[00:57:07.123 --> 00:57:14.267]  Whatever you say about the Illuminati, they have got patience and they have had incredible vision.
[00:57:14.267 --> 00:57:19.670]  But I believe humanity needs to hear the truth and understand this is being carried out against us all.
[00:57:20.490 --> 00:57:25.874]  Because we have a choice to stand up now, but only a short window, and say no.
[00:57:25.874 --> 00:57:27.736]  I know the plot of the film.
[00:57:27.736 --> 00:57:29.237]  I know how it ends.
[00:57:29.237 --> 00:57:31.699]  But I'm going to leave that for you to discover.
[00:57:31.699 --> 00:57:45.730]  The point is, the film itself is only a revelation of the method, an externalization of the hierarchy.
[00:57:45.730 --> 00:57:47.771]  That's the Inside Scoop on Prometheus.
[00:57:47.771 --> 00:57:48.452]  Stay with us.
[00:57:48.452 --> 00:57:49.933]  We'll be back for the second hour.
[00:57:51.229 --> 00:57:56.214]  Folks, Iran and the Mideast nuclear mess is already ballooning our gas prices.
[00:57:56.214 --> 00:58:10.827]  Whether you're struggling with food costs which are being blown up by gas costs now, or know that when the Mideast showdown explodes, whatever food supply you have is all you'll get because of huge panic demand, eFoods Direct Family Packs are the answer.

[00:58:51.638 --> 00:58:53.340]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:58.647]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity, and recognize risk.
[00:58:58.647 --> 00:59:00.190]  Saving means to make money.
[00:59:00.190 --> 00:59:08.961]  The Cal Bend Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old-fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[00:59:09.702 --> 00:59:17.225]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[00:59:17.225 --> 00:59:25.249]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[00:59:25.249 --> 00:59:30.471]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.

[00:59:53.064 --> 00:59:55.105]  Direct from Austin.
[00:59:55.105 --> 00:59:58.327]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:00.674 --> 01:00:03.075]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:00:03.075 --> 01:00:03.955]  A lie!
[01:00:03.955 --> 01:00:05.956]  No man is obsolete!
[01:00:05.956 --> 01:00:07.856]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[01:00:07.856 --> 01:00:11.077]  You're an anachronism, like a ghost from another time!
[01:00:11.077 --> 01:00:16.539]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages!
[01:00:16.539 --> 01:00:18.219]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:00:18.219 --> 01:00:19.720]  A crawling insect!
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.781]  An ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning!
[01:00:24.381 --> 01:00:25.883]  I am a human being!
[01:00:25.883 --> 01:00:33.634]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension, like air, like the wind!
[01:00:33.634 --> 01:00:34.335]  I don't care!
[01:00:34.335 --> 01:00:35.797]  I tell you, I don't care!
[01:00:35.797 --> 01:00:37.379]  I'm a human being!
[01:00:37.379 --> 01:00:37.900]  I exist!
[01:00:38.942 --> 01:00:45.086]  And if I speak one thought aloud, that thought lives, even after I'm shoveled into my grave!
[01:00:45.086 --> 01:00:48.248]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth!
[01:00:48.248 --> 01:00:55.933]  Delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you have a strength, when you have no strength at all!
[01:00:55.933 --> 01:01:01.297]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream, and the strength has no use for your kind!
[01:01:02.972 --> 01:01:07.055]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[01:01:07.055 --> 01:01:09.156]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:01:09.156 --> 01:01:15.801]  That's right, it is Sunday, April 1st, 2012.
[01:01:15.801 --> 01:01:17.983]  We're into the second hour.
[01:01:17.983 --> 01:01:19.384]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:01:21.167 --> 01:01:23.068]  Wow!
[01:01:23.068 --> 01:01:40.816]  Coming up, we're going to have Dave Mustaine, excerpts of the TV interview I did with him airing here on the radio, and then we're going to have two segments with David Icke, some of the most important excerpts of what he said in an hour-long or close to hour-long interview we did a few days ago.
[01:01:40.816 --> 01:01:44.858]  But I was just thinking about the Prometheus piece that we just aired, and
[01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:55.909]  How truly bizarre it is that the leadership of this planet believes that they know the secrets to human development, and maybe they do.
[01:01:55.909 --> 01:01:59.470]  Maybe they've been passing this down through secret societies forever.
[01:01:59.470 --> 01:02:01.871]  That's kind of the plot of The Fifth Element as well.
[01:02:01.871 --> 01:02:08.094]  With Bruce Willis and whatever that lovely actress is.
[01:02:08.094 --> 01:02:08.654]  What's her name?
[01:02:08.654 --> 01:02:11.596]  From The Fifth Element?
[01:02:11.596 --> 01:02:14.197]  She's also in all those Resident Evil movies.
[01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:14.557]  Something...
[01:02:16.252 --> 01:02:22.736]  Mia Djokovic, another one of God's beautiful creations.
[01:02:22.736 --> 01:02:34.004]  The point is, is that we need to have a debate and discussion about the globalists as they think they're God and all they're doing is wrecking the planet while lecturing us all day about how they are going to take all our rights away and kill us to protect the planet.
[01:02:34.004 --> 01:02:35.345]  Not really, they just like to kill people.
[01:02:36.141 --> 01:02:37.202]  That's what's going on.
[01:02:37.202 --> 01:02:47.008]  Speaking of that, the Supreme Court supposedly has secretly ruled on the healthcare situation, and I'm wondering if we're going to get any leaks on this.
[01:02:47.008 --> 01:02:49.330]  Maybe there's leaks now, I don't know.
[01:02:49.330 --> 01:02:52.772]  Lots of rumors that they're going to affirm government-run eugenics healthcare.
[01:02:52.772 --> 01:02:57.876]  Can you imagine this criminal government controlling what type of healthcare you're going to get?
[01:02:57.876 --> 01:03:02.319]  But they're also saying that we'll know for sure by late June, they have to write their
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:12.023]  They're ruling their findings down and that we'll supposedly know this by June.
[01:03:12.023 --> 01:03:15.664]  But I hope that they don't just strike down parts of it.
[01:03:15.664 --> 01:03:28.870]  They've got to strike down the entire stinking slag heap that is corporate fascist health care written by the insurance companies to make 35 million people get health care and cut down what type of
[01:03:30.424 --> 01:03:31.625]  Health care they get.
[01:03:31.625 --> 01:03:39.531]  You know, more and more I ask the crew when they're looking through the news to give me stacks of news on weird stuff that's confirmed but bizarre.
[01:03:39.531 --> 01:03:40.672]  And you've got to look at this story.
[01:03:40.672 --> 01:03:42.193]  We've got it up at InfoWars.com.
[01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:45.776]  Did a sea monster wash up on South Carolina coast?
[01:03:45.776 --> 01:03:52.441]  And it's a giant thing that looks like, looks like, it looks like something out of a science fiction movie.
[01:03:52.441 --> 01:03:53.602]  It looks like the brain bug.
[01:03:56.266 --> 01:03:58.528]  And I'm not talking about Webster Tarpley.
[01:03:58.528 --> 01:04:01.752]  I'm talking about... That's a secret nickname I've now released.
[01:04:01.752 --> 01:04:02.392]  He's awesome.
[01:04:02.392 --> 01:04:03.693]  So smart.
[01:04:03.693 --> 01:04:07.257]  I'm talking about the brain bug from... There's bookworms.
[01:04:07.257 --> 01:04:09.199]  There's also brain bugs.
[01:04:09.199 --> 01:04:13.503]  But there's also the brain bug from Starship Troopers.
[01:04:13.503 --> 01:04:15.565]  Remember that one?
[01:04:15.565 --> 01:04:16.706]  This looks like the brain bug!
[01:04:17.614 --> 01:04:28.931]  Residents in South Carolina Coastal Town believe they're dealing with a whole different kind of sea monster than an alarmingly large, strange-looking body of some kind of aquatic creature washed up on the coastal state's Folly Beach.
[01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:29.852]  Man, that's weird-looking.
[01:04:31.495 --> 01:04:37.619]  And what's strange about it is, they thought coelacanths had been extinct for millions of years and they found them off the coast of Africa.
[01:04:37.619 --> 01:04:38.320]  Who knows, man?
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:40.141]  This is some wild-looking creatures.
[01:04:40.141 --> 01:04:42.342]  There's a lot of stuff down in that deep, dark ocean.
[01:04:42.342 --> 01:04:45.665]  Man hasn't even begun to discover what's going on on this planet.
[01:04:45.665 --> 01:04:51.489]  Okay, we're going to come back and give you Dave Mustaine of Megadeth talking about the New World Order more.
[01:04:51.489 --> 01:04:54.391]  And then we're going to give you David Icke.
[01:04:54.391 --> 01:04:56.813]  Two Daves in one hour.
[01:04:56.813 --> 01:04:58.954]  Stay with us on AlexJonesOfInfoWars.com.
[01:05:00.757 --> 01:05:07.979]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:05:07.979 --> 01:05:25.565]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:05:25.845 --> 01:05:32.032]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[01:05:32.032 --> 01:05:40.201]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need and once you've got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied.
[01:05:40.201 --> 01:05:41.642]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months.
[01:05:43.704 --> 01:05:46.505]  Simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:05:46.505 --> 01:05:47.786]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:05:47.786 --> 01:05:48.646]  It's incredible.
[01:05:48.646 --> 01:05:57.869]  Go to Infowarsteam.com today and order your first canister of Beyond Tangy Tangerine Complete Multivitamin Mineral Complex Dietary Supplement.
[01:05:57.869 --> 01:05:59.750]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:06:34.793 --> 01:06:42.696]  Well, my fellow info warriors and truth seekers, we've got a real treat for you tonight in studio here in Austin, Texas.
[01:06:43.908 --> 01:06:53.492]  Here in the bunker with us is Dave Mustaine, founder of Megadeth, one of the first members of Metallica, known as one of the greatest guitarists of all time.
[01:06:53.492 --> 01:06:57.214]  And he's a patriot who loves liberty and loves this country and loves God.
[01:06:57.214 --> 01:06:59.695]  I tell you, I love Dave Mustaine.
[01:06:59.695 --> 01:07:02.576]  He just ended his big Gigantor tour.
[01:07:02.576 --> 01:07:03.857]  Huge success.
[01:07:03.857 --> 01:07:05.558]  David, it's great to have you here with us.
[01:07:05.558 --> 01:07:06.558]  Thanks, Alex.
[01:07:06.558 --> 01:07:07.699]  Good to be here, finally.
[01:07:07.699 --> 01:07:08.159]  Wow!
[01:07:08.159 --> 01:07:10.300]  So you just ended the tour here in Austin.
[01:07:10.785 --> 01:07:15.047]  Yeah, Gigantor 2012 in North America we ended.
[01:07:15.047 --> 01:07:22.309]  There's no telling how much longer Gigantor will go in other countries and stuff like that, but this was the end of the beginning of this year.
[01:07:22.309 --> 01:07:29.432]  We started on Philadelphia over on the East Coast and worked up into Canada and across Canada pretty well.
[01:07:29.432 --> 01:07:33.874]  We have a Canadian drummer, so we all of a sudden became really huge up there.
[01:07:33.874 --> 01:07:34.094]  Good.
[01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:40.006]  Is it just me, or is Megadeth getting bigger than ever?
[01:07:40.006 --> 01:07:41.288]  Because I hear about it all the place.
[01:07:41.288 --> 01:07:42.709]  I hear it a lot more on the radio.
[01:07:42.709 --> 01:07:46.253]  You guys are so prolific, and stuff's even getting better.
[01:07:46.253 --> 01:07:51.077]  I think we're getting more popular, but with what happened with...
[01:07:52.068 --> 01:08:04.019]  Unlocking the recording industry and everybody being able to get records basically at will, we had to kind of focus more on the live aspect.
[01:08:04.019 --> 01:08:14.408]  So I think the hard work touring has paid off because whether record sales help a band survive anymore or not, we're still able to continue to get out to the masses because
[01:08:15.189 --> 01:08:16.670]  You know, good times, bad times.
[01:08:16.670 --> 01:08:24.072]  People like entertainment and the funny thing is during, you know, when it's considerably tougher times, heavy metal becomes more popular.
[01:08:24.072 --> 01:08:32.996]  So, as things have kind of gone in a more difficult period, the same way it was during in the 80s, you know, it's cyclical.
[01:08:32.996 --> 01:08:39.578]  It's the same stuff and times are getting kind of tough now and heavy metal is becoming much more popular again.
[01:08:45.032 --> 01:09:02.616]  You know, every record, it's kind of like a snapshot of your life and you have to live life in between records to experience something so that you're not just regurgitating the same stupid song and lyrics, you know, a hundred times because people will eventually catch on to that.
[01:09:02.616 --> 01:09:08.978]  But there's also the fact that when people discover a band in the very beginning, that's the band that they hold on to.
[01:09:09.338 --> 01:09:15.962]  Very rarely do you see a band go 13 albums into their career, like we have, and still continue to generate new fans.
[01:09:15.962 --> 01:09:24.587]  And, you know, although you do lose fans on the way, you know, they grow up, people get married, their wives tell them to stop listening to metal, and, you know, then that's the end of the story.
[01:09:24.587 --> 01:09:31.991]  Or, you know, people just, they just start playing it themselves and don't listen to it because they make their own music.
[01:09:31.991 --> 01:09:36.174]  When MySpace came out, there was, I think at one time I remember, there was a study, there was
[01:09:37.714 --> 01:09:43.398]  Eight million MySpace pages with people that had their own music uploaded onto it.
[01:09:43.398 --> 01:09:51.765]  And I was thinking like, God, eight million fans on there, and probably 750, or seven and a half million of them suck, you know?
[01:09:51.765 --> 01:09:59.371]  Because even that 500,000 that would have good stuff, you've got your whole life to write your first record.
[01:09:59.371 --> 01:10:02.614]  And when it's time to write your second one, that's when the pressure's on.
[01:10:02.614 --> 01:10:04.395]  It wasn't like we just got a different engineer.
[01:10:04.395 --> 01:10:06.497]  We had a new producer working with me, so
[01:10:07.157 --> 01:10:20.171]  In the beginning, it was kind of like, all right, who's this guy, Johnny K, you know, and what's he all about, you know, and he did Stained and, you know, that was kind of like those guys and Metal Is Us guys.
[01:10:20.171 --> 01:10:21.572]  So when Johnny came,
[01:10:22.848 --> 01:10:24.929]  He was recommended by our bassist, David Elveson.
[01:10:24.929 --> 01:10:27.071]  I didn't know anything about him.
[01:10:27.071 --> 01:10:33.614]  And, uh, you know, it was kind of like, you know, two, um, dogs kind of sizing each other up.
[01:10:33.614 --> 01:10:38.858]  You know, although we didn't get into it at all, we became, you know, fast friends.
[01:10:38.858 --> 01:10:42.380]  Um, there, there was some time where I thought, you know,
[01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:44.481]  Is this going to work?
[01:10:44.481 --> 01:10:48.103]  Because, you know, we spent, we had eight weeks to make the record.
[01:10:48.103 --> 01:10:50.984]  And we had to do 13 songs.
[01:10:50.984 --> 01:10:55.726]  And one of the songs had to be done immediately for Guitar Hero.
[01:10:55.726 --> 01:10:57.287]  And, I mean, for Konami.
[01:10:57.287 --> 01:10:58.708]  That was the Never Dead song.
[01:10:58.708 --> 01:11:03.690]  And Sudden Death had come out earlier that year.
[01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:06.412]  We started working on the song when David Elfson came back.
[01:11:06.412 --> 01:11:08.513]  And we were in the process of doing it for the game.
[01:11:08.513 --> 01:11:10.114]  And it was going to be included in the record.
[01:11:10.114 --> 01:11:12.915]  So that was actually the first time that Elfson recorded with us again.
[01:11:13.355 --> 01:11:17.336]  In fact, I was going to bring that point back.
[01:11:17.336 --> 01:11:19.317]  It's great to see David back in the band.
[01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:21.237]  Yeah, he's a good dude.
[01:11:21.237 --> 01:11:22.397]  He's pretty funny.
[01:11:22.397 --> 01:11:25.658]  There's an irony about this guy.
[01:11:25.658 --> 01:11:30.219]  He's studying to be a pastor, but he swears more than I do.
[01:11:30.219 --> 01:11:34.900]  He's in a 12-step program, but he drinks coffee from morning till night.
[01:11:37.621 --> 01:11:41.742]  You know, good thing for me is we're friends.
[01:11:41.742 --> 01:11:54.245]  I've always cared about him, even during, you know, the period we went through where we were kind of estranged from each other, you know, because when you're in a band together, you guys become almost like, it's kind of like a weird marriage, so to speak, like a family kind of thing.
[01:11:54.245 --> 01:12:00.187]  You know, everybody always says that, but it usually, it breaks up because, you know, families fracture.
[01:12:00.187 --> 01:12:03.528]  You can't always expect all four people to have the same viewpoint.
[01:12:04.248 --> 01:12:27.544]  And we didn't at a period of time and me being the leader I had to make some unpopular Decisions and and of course when things go wrong, you know, it's my fault and when things go great It's everybody's credit, you know so I accepted that early in the game because I knew that was how things were going to be portrayed and When we got back together again after and all the the lawsuit and stuff had happened you Dave Dave had
[01:12:29.737 --> 01:12:32.078]  He was contrite about what, you know, had happened.
[01:12:32.078 --> 01:12:34.820]  His case against me got completely dismissed.
[01:12:34.820 --> 01:12:37.801]  And he actually got really hurt.
[01:12:37.801 --> 01:12:40.723]  The fans were really pissed him for suing me.
[01:12:40.723 --> 01:12:44.005]  And I kept telling him, you know, I love Dave.
[01:12:44.005 --> 01:12:47.687]  The sad thing is that, you know, the kids are getting hurt in this, you know.
[01:12:48.627 --> 01:12:59.079]  Funny thing is our kids are so resilient they don't even think about it they get together and they're just jumping on each other and you know acting like stupid kids so that you know it didn't even affect him.
[01:12:59.079 --> 01:13:05.105]  I saw him at dinner one time and I said you know he said it was the dumbest thing he's ever done and I said I forgive you and that was the beginning of the
[01:13:05.866 --> 01:13:15.856]  The path back to him joining the band again, you know, we tried a couple times to talk and God's timing just wasn't right, you know And when the time was right, it was it was effortless.
[01:13:15.856 --> 01:13:18.739]  He came in he started playing I was looking through my hair kind of
[01:13:19.525 --> 01:13:28.935]  Kind of like trying to clandestinely check him out and see if he was, you know, having trouble or if he wasn't into it or if he was enjoying himself or whatnot.
[01:13:28.935 --> 01:13:40.147]  And it was pretty cool because it, you know, give or take, you know, some hair colors changing or some hair loss, you know, we're like the same two kids we met when we met in Los Angeles back in the 80s.
[01:13:40.968 --> 01:13:48.036]  I was about to say, it was great to see him back in the band because I'd always just seen him in photos at a couple of concerts where I'd seen him early on many years ago.
[01:13:48.036 --> 01:13:48.777]  It was like, wow!
[01:13:48.777 --> 01:13:50.038]  I remember this guy, too.
[01:13:50.038 --> 01:13:50.859]  This is even greater.
[01:13:50.859 --> 01:13:53.061]  And he's such a nice guy.
[01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:58.708]  Dave, we haven't really gotten into politics yet in this interview, but you were telling me just basically about what happened with the whole Santorum thing.
[01:13:58.708 --> 01:13:59.548]  What went on there?
[01:14:00.229 --> 01:14:22.080]  Well, you know, it's no secret I've been writing songs about not being happy with the way that the peasants are treated in the valley, you know, and being one myself, you know, the lyrics in Peace Sells talks a lot about what my beliefs are, you know, I go to work when I have to, I go to court when I have to, I pay my bills, you know, I believe in God, you know, all the things like our founding fathers would have been proud of, you know what I mean?
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:27.825]  And I was talking, doing an interview with this guy, innocently enough.
[01:14:27.825 --> 01:14:29.647]  He asked me what I thought about the candidates.
[01:14:29.647 --> 01:14:39.416]  I went through the Republican candidates and said what I thought of each one at the time because it was during that horrible, embarrassing smear campaign that they were all waging towards each other.
[01:14:40.417 --> 01:14:42.359]  I told Ron Paul that last time I was on.
[01:14:42.359 --> 01:14:44.861]  I said, I get you guys all to fight with each other, but...
[01:14:57.210 --> 01:14:58.010]  Transcend!
[01:14:58.010 --> 01:14:59.931]  Go after Obama!
[01:14:59.931 --> 01:15:10.516]  Yeah, and it's not even going after Obama, it's going after the ideals that America was founded on and that we, you know, we have a constitution.
[01:15:10.516 --> 01:15:17.980]  I saw a joke the other day, someone said that I think Syria was writing a new constitution and that they could have ours because we don't use it anymore.
[01:15:18.940 --> 01:15:31.375]  You know, but to get back to the point, I was just talking about the politics like I did when I did Rock the Vote, you know, and the second person who picked up the story.
[01:15:32.646 --> 01:15:34.967]  said I endorsed Rick Santorum.
[01:15:34.967 --> 01:15:39.409]  And, you know, I put out a press release after that that said I never used the word endorsed.
[01:15:39.409 --> 01:15:47.112]  I said that I liked the guy because he jumped off the campaign trail to go be with his sick daughter.
[01:15:47.112 --> 01:15:55.356]  Now, that to me, whether you're a football player or an astronaut, if you put your family first, you get kudos in my book.
[01:16:00.865 --> 01:16:02.166]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:07.749]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:16:07.749 --> 01:16:12.771]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:16:12.771 --> 01:16:13.231]  It's true.
[01:16:13.231 --> 01:16:17.794]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:16:18.334 --> 01:16:23.560]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.

[01:17:01.411 --> 01:17:16.881]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.

[01:19:00.763 --> 01:19:01.823]  I had tried everything.
[01:19:01.823 --> 01:19:04.184]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[01:19:04.184 --> 01:19:07.304]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:19:07.304 --> 01:19:12.145]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:19:12.145 --> 01:19:18.986]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:19:18.986 --> 01:19:29.448]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.

[01:19:40.953 --> 01:19:42.514]  Now that's results.

[01:20:01.710 --> 01:20:05.292]  Coast to Coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:05.292 --> 01:20:13.958]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:13.958 --> 01:20:14.538]  We are back.
[01:20:14.538 --> 01:20:17.580]  Thank you for listening to the April 1st Sunday edition.
[01:20:17.580 --> 01:20:22.344]  I'll be back live tomorrow, 11am to 2pm Central, InfoWars.com with a weekday show.
[01:20:22.344 --> 01:20:28.187]  But let's go back to this exclusive InfoWars interview with Dave Mustaine and coming up, David Icke.
[01:20:28.187 --> 01:20:30.309]  He's got some very interesting stuff to tell us.
[01:20:37.407 --> 01:20:49.629]  You were telling me a story, and you were saying, you know, I see the new up-and-coming musicians coming in that are opening for us, and then I see some of the older ones, and it's kind of like the prodigal son.
[01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:54.170]  You're there explaining to them, this is kind of like, you know, the stages of life.
[01:20:54.170 --> 01:20:55.410]  This is the lesson from life.
[01:20:55.410 --> 01:20:56.271]  What did you mean by that?
[01:20:56.271 --> 01:21:01.311]  I mean, describe how people come into music, how they leave music.
[01:21:01.311 --> 01:21:03.292]  Well, it's hard to...
[01:21:05.262 --> 01:21:14.368]  To explain to some musicians sometimes when they come into the music business, they've got their whole lives to write their first record.
[01:21:14.368 --> 01:21:23.074]  But when I say that, I mean that you've got four or five people, sometimes three, in a band that have their whole life to write their first record.
[01:21:23.074 --> 01:21:28.758]  And you have a conglomeration of maybe anywhere from 10 to 40 or 50 songs that they can weed through.
[01:21:29.676 --> 01:21:35.637]  But after that process of elimination, you realize a lot of it is just kind of like, you know, getting rid of the gristle and the fat and stuff like that.
[01:21:35.637 --> 01:21:37.958]  You get down to the real meat of all the songs.
[01:21:37.958 --> 01:21:39.278]  You kind of have a lot left.
[01:21:39.278 --> 01:21:42.879]  And then when it's time to do your second record, the pressure's on.
[01:21:42.879 --> 01:21:44.939]  Our second record was Peace House, But Who's Buying?
[01:21:44.939 --> 01:21:49.080]  And that was, for us, way more successful than Killing was.
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:52.361]  And as we've grown along, we've learned a lot of things on the way.
[01:21:52.361 --> 01:21:54.241]  And some people you can talk to and they'll listen to you.
[01:21:54.241 --> 01:21:55.701]  And others, they're like, you know what?
[01:21:55.701 --> 01:21:56.782]  Thanks for the information.
[01:21:56.782 --> 01:21:58.562]  I don't need any more anything from you.
[01:21:59.182 --> 01:22:09.090]  You know, and sometimes I look at him and I think, well, you know, you're going to be in one of those guys that gets in a band and, you know, it doesn't mean absolutely nothing.
[01:22:09.090 --> 01:22:11.752]  You know, when I got in a band, it was to be in a band for life.
[01:22:11.752 --> 01:22:17.136]  You know, I never intended on having to part ways with Metallica.
[01:22:17.136 --> 01:22:24.282]  And it happened, you know, and I don't intend on parting ways with Megadeth, but you know what, at some point I'm going to hang up my guitar.
[01:22:24.282 --> 01:22:25.163]  And it's just,
[01:22:25.803 --> 01:22:32.951]  With the stress on my shoulder and with the touring that we do, the demands around the world, I can't keep up with it.
[01:22:32.951 --> 01:22:35.234]  You know, it's a great problem to have.
[01:22:35.234 --> 01:22:38.077]  You know, I think God's really blessed me in an amazing way.
[01:22:38.077 --> 01:22:41.060]  All the bad stuff that I've done over my life that, you know, just by
[01:22:41.821 --> 01:22:46.444]  Saying something as significantly and symbolically simple as just saying, hey, you know what?
[01:22:46.444 --> 01:22:49.646]  I'm not God, you are, and I'm going to listen for a little while and see what happens.
[01:22:49.646 --> 01:22:54.208]  And, you know, the road got smooth and my career's turned around.
[01:22:54.208 --> 01:22:56.670]  I got my best friend back playing bass with me.
[01:22:56.670 --> 01:22:57.630]  My kids like me.
[01:22:57.630 --> 01:22:59.952]  You know, traffic's gotten better.
[01:22:59.952 --> 01:23:02.333]  You know, it's just a whole complete paradigm shift.
[01:23:02.333 --> 01:23:04.014]  The universe lays before you.
[01:23:04.014 --> 01:23:06.396]  It's a long way to the top if you want to rock and roll.
[01:23:06.396 --> 01:23:07.056]  That's right.
[01:23:07.056 --> 01:23:08.417]  That's right.
[01:23:08.817 --> 01:23:12.218]  Everybody thinks that people that are successful, even if they have talent, they think, oh, it was just given to you.
[01:23:12.218 --> 01:23:16.620]  Even if you've got Zeus lightning bolts, it still is a lot of work.
[01:23:16.620 --> 01:23:17.680]  Hey, you can be a great player.
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:20.081]  That doesn't mean you're going to be in a great band.
[01:23:20.081 --> 01:23:23.403]  You know, the alleyways are littered with Olympians.
[01:23:23.403 --> 01:23:33.647]  And, you know, to think that there are so many other guitar players that are better than I am, so many singers that are better than I am, you know... Well, are there folks better than you at, like, speed metal?
[01:23:33.647 --> 01:23:36.868]  Because I've talked to famous guitarists, and they say, wow, Dave Mustaine's amazing.
[01:23:37.088 --> 01:23:38.169]  Yeah, there are plenty.
[01:23:38.169 --> 01:23:40.730]  I believe my guitar partner is a better guitarist than I am.
[01:23:40.730 --> 01:23:54.900]  I mean, I'm a good songwriter because I write from my heart and, you know, having all those hard knocks and, you know, the stuff I was telling you about the hand-me-down clothes and stuff, you know, that whole thing really... Okay, there you go, you gotta tell that story.
[01:23:54.900 --> 01:24:06.888]  It just gives you character, you know, and just growing up and wanting to fit in, you know, when you finally get that shot, it becomes inebriating.
[01:24:07.408 --> 01:24:17.818]  You know and when when I finally knew I was gonna become something as a musician I felt like you know what I'm not gonna be this latchkey kid anymore I'm not gonna be wearing you know hand-me-down clothes.
[01:24:17.818 --> 01:24:28.547]  I'm not gonna be you know Getting food stamps and having to get lunch tickets at school and all that stuff that you know you look at a kid Like that in school today, and you think like oh, he's a low-income punk.
[01:24:28.547 --> 01:24:30.809]  He's a brat He's never gonna amount to anything you know and
[01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:32.991]  And I was that.
[01:24:32.991 --> 01:24:34.693]  But in a way, that's good.
[01:24:34.693 --> 01:24:40.838]  I know, like, you know, these wealthy kids in Uber, Reach, whatever, they're even more wrecked, because they expect everything.
[01:24:40.838 --> 01:24:44.821]  I mean, some of the most valuable things in my life, I grew up middle class.
[01:24:44.821 --> 01:24:48.865]  My parents were so country, they didn't even think I needed the cool clothes.
[01:24:48.865 --> 01:24:52.488]  It's like, you get your clothes once a year, that's it, so we'll sew the holes up in them.
[01:24:52.488 --> 01:24:52.708]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:24:52.708 --> 01:24:53.669]  Because that's what you get.
[01:24:53.669 --> 01:24:56.972]  It wasn't even like, they didn't even know what trendy was.
[01:24:56.972 --> 01:24:57.172]  Yeah.
[01:24:57.552 --> 01:25:04.414]  But I remember kids making fun of me for my clothes, but what I remember was kids that had flunked three grades ganging up and stomping on me.
[01:25:04.414 --> 01:25:10.316]  And at the time it was horrible, but I went home and my dad wasn't a tough guy, but he said, well, you just better kick their ass.
[01:25:10.316 --> 01:25:20.160]  And it's like, not that I'm a tough guy, but it's like the fact that I learned to stand up for myself and got beat up and had my leg broken and all this other stuff that like is really valuable now because now I'm not scared.
[01:25:20.680 --> 01:25:35.651]  Yeah, you know, I've always respected people who are my friends that are willing to say, hey, you know what, what you're doing isn't right because, you know, it could end up in me getting hurt, hurting them, jeopardizing my family, safety of others, my career.
[01:25:35.651 --> 01:25:37.533]  You know, there's been some dumb stuff I've done.
[01:25:37.533 --> 01:25:40.195]  Jumping out of a perfectly good operating airplane.
[01:25:40.195 --> 01:25:45.078]  That's not, you know, people just don't think, hey, I'm going to grab a backpack and jump out of an airplane.
[01:25:45.078 --> 01:25:47.921]  But that's what I did over and over and over when I was skydiving.
[01:25:48.621 --> 01:25:59.669]  You know, and the thought of that now that I'm a little bit older, I was thinking, oh my God, because Justice, our son, had said that he wanted to skydive, and I was thinking, oh God, how do I tell him not to do this?
[01:25:59.669 --> 01:26:01.791]  You know, because I was crazy at the time.
[01:26:01.791 --> 01:26:03.232]  I wasn't even supposed to skydive.
[01:26:03.232 --> 01:26:04.533]  I had done an interview, and again,
[01:26:05.513 --> 01:26:08.395]  English into a foreign language translated back into English.
[01:26:08.395 --> 01:26:18.543]  I told some lady that I wanted to skydive and she said that I did and I was so gullible at the time, so conscientious of all the people that were always, you know, going after me.
[01:26:18.543 --> 01:26:23.567]  I thought, well, I gotta do it so that I don't look like a liar, you know.
[01:26:23.567 --> 01:26:28.431]  And it's sad when you're in that place where people have that kind of control over you, you know.
[01:26:28.431 --> 01:26:32.334]  Fortunately for me, I got healed from all that, but it was fun the first time I skydived.
[01:26:33.717 --> 01:26:35.098]  Well, Dave, I don't want to wear you out here.
[01:26:35.098 --> 01:26:40.162]  You've done an incredible job on this interview after this long tour, and it's just amazing.
[01:26:40.162 --> 01:26:42.785]  You wanted to tell the Bill Clinton story, so let's close with that.
[01:26:46.050 --> 01:26:56.435]  Well, I had gone to the White House because I'd done that work with the Rock the Vote thing, and I had gotten asked by some people out in Los Angeles to get involved with that.
[01:26:56.435 --> 01:26:58.156]  I unfortunately can't remember their name.
[01:26:58.156 --> 01:27:11.342]  I do remember Dave Sorelnick from MTV was helping me as I did all the coverage and, you know, got in the Democratic National Convention and covered a lot of stuff and talked with a lot of people, and that kind of solidified my
[01:27:12.262 --> 01:27:12.582]  I don't know.
[01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:35.500]  You know, voting is a huge part of the democratic process, you know.
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.941]  I mean, you watch them vote on cooking shows and stuff like that, you know.
[01:27:38.941 --> 01:27:41.282]  So I thought it was important to get involved with that.
[01:27:41.282 --> 01:27:42.502]  Dwight Yoakam was in on that.
[01:27:42.502 --> 01:27:44.983]  A lot of other really cool people were in on that.
[01:27:44.983 --> 01:27:48.424]  And when it got passed, we all got invited up to the White House.
[01:27:48.424 --> 01:27:50.984]  And we went up there with the dudes from Living Color and stuff.
[01:27:50.984 --> 01:27:54.065]  And I kept thinking about Willie Nelson smoking dope on the top of the White House.
[01:27:54.065 --> 01:27:56.926]  And I wonder if they still do that, you know, that kind of stuff.
[01:27:57.706 --> 01:28:05.795]  And I had my little coin at the time, because I was in a 12-step program at the time, and I walked up to President Clinton.
[01:28:06.909 --> 01:28:08.990]  And I said, hello, Mr. Clinton.
[01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:10.691]  I said, this is my coin here.
[01:28:10.691 --> 01:28:12.152]  And he took it from me.
[01:28:12.152 --> 01:28:13.093]  And he stuck it in his pocket.
[01:28:13.093 --> 01:28:13.873]  And I said, no, no, no.
[01:28:13.873 --> 01:28:14.714]  That's not for you.
[01:28:14.714 --> 01:28:17.275]  I just wanted you to hold it and give me some mojo.
[01:28:17.275 --> 01:28:18.696]  And so he goes, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:28:18.696 --> 01:28:19.597]  And he handed it back to me.
[01:28:19.597 --> 01:28:23.919]  And yeah, that was my moment with the president.
[01:28:23.919 --> 01:28:25.320]  I thought it was pretty cool.
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:33.185]  I think that it's something that everybody should aspire to do to make a contribution to this great nation for the good of everybody.
[01:28:34.045 --> 01:28:39.249]  And if you don't know the difference between what's right and what's wrong, just open your mind up.
[01:28:39.249 --> 01:28:41.450]  There are great outlets like you here.
[01:28:41.450 --> 01:28:44.092]  Some people may not agree with everything that you say.
[01:28:44.092 --> 01:28:46.514]  That's what makes us individuals.
[01:28:46.514 --> 01:28:52.038]  But there are a lot of people who are people like you that believe in country and God and family and stuff like that.
[01:28:52.038 --> 01:28:54.059]  I know you as my friend.
[01:28:54.059 --> 01:28:58.262]  And, you know, you just got to kind of look for the good in stuff.
[01:28:58.262 --> 01:28:59.964]  It's right there, hidden right in front of your face.
[01:29:01.297 --> 01:29:07.959]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.

[01:29:13.101 --> 01:29:21.825]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.

[01:29:39.989 --> 01:29:42.130]  We turn jeans inside out.

[01:31:00.299 --> 01:31:07.522]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:31:07.522 --> 01:31:25.408]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:31:25.408 --> 01:31:29.510]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:31:29.790 --> 01:31:31.571]  And discovered Young-Jevity.

[01:33:05.289 --> 01:33:11.513]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:33:11.513 --> 01:33:14.995]  Welcome back to this special edition of InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:33:14.995 --> 01:33:18.738]  Special because we've got one of my favorite guests, David Icke.
[01:33:18.738 --> 01:33:21.259]  He's got some interesting observations.
[01:33:21.259 --> 01:33:22.460]  He's being protested.
[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:25.282]  Groups don't want him to speak.
[01:33:25.282 --> 01:33:26.443]  Also, just before we
[01:33:26.903 --> 01:33:27.103]  I think?
[01:33:42.120 --> 01:33:47.201]  They're admitting that, oh, your appliances do have hidden tech in them to spy on you.
[01:33:47.201 --> 01:33:51.063]  Why are they throwing it all in our face right now?
[01:33:51.063 --> 01:33:54.363]  I have my own ideas, but we'll get David Icke's take on that.
[01:33:54.363 --> 01:33:59.525]  But he is visiting now here in the 50th state, Hawaii.
[01:33:59.525 --> 01:34:01.665]  David joining us via audio Skype.
[01:34:01.665 --> 01:34:02.966]  Great to have you, David.
[01:34:02.966 --> 01:34:03.386]  Cheers, Alex.
[01:34:03.726 --> 01:34:05.527]  Well, how was your trip out there?
[01:34:05.527 --> 01:34:07.347]  What's your view on the TSA?
[01:34:07.347 --> 01:34:11.469]  Well, it's three quarters around the world for me, so it was a long trip.
[01:34:11.469 --> 01:34:21.172]  But I did experience the TSA one or two times already, both in Los Angeles and then moving around the islands here.
[01:34:21.952 --> 01:34:24.294]  And, um, you know, it was, it was, it was fine.
[01:34:24.294 --> 01:34:28.839]  I had to pat down and, and, uh, got, uh, you know, through and all the rest of it.
[01:34:28.839 --> 01:34:41.491]  But what shocks me, Alex, and what has, uh, shocks me every time I come to America, and indeed, you know, some other countries that have these full body scanners, is to stand there.
[01:34:42.231 --> 01:34:45.333]  In the line, you know, shoes off, belt off, all this stuff.
[01:34:45.333 --> 01:34:54.059]  And while that's going on, you're watching parents take the children through these full-body scanners.
[01:34:54.059 --> 01:34:55.860]  It is extraordinary.
[01:34:55.860 --> 01:34:56.820]  And, you know, we can...
[01:34:58.297 --> 01:35:19.298]  Discuss various definitions of child abuse, but I would say that the ignorance of subjecting your children to this radiation every time they go through an airport with no question, come on honey, quick, there you go, and all this stuff, no question, no thought, no...
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:29.727]  Question about what the effect on the child might be, and of course radiation has a greater impact on children for various genetic medical reasons.
[01:35:29.727 --> 01:35:34.131]  It's just extraordinary to me how asleep people can be.
[01:35:34.131 --> 01:35:37.594]  And you know, people talk about ignorance being bliss.
[01:35:37.594 --> 01:35:41.258]  Well, ignorance is bliss but only for a while, because ignorance always catches up with you.
[01:35:42.178 --> 01:35:50.424]  And, you know, ignorance of this, the impact of these radiation scanners is going to catch up with enormous numbers of people.
[01:35:50.424 --> 01:36:01.711]  The frequent flyers, which of course you have so many in America, they are picking this stuff up all the time, day after day after day, and the cumulative effect is going to be devastating.
[01:36:01.711 --> 01:36:06.094]  But how parents can just allow that to happen to their children is just
[01:36:06.434 --> 01:36:09.316]  Absolutely extraordinary to me, beyond words.
[01:36:09.316 --> 01:36:26.128]  David, can you imagine ten years ago, if we would have told people they're going to put you in naked body scanners, save a naked image of you, which they've been caught doing, lying of course, and parents are going to let their children be separated from them, scared, and have men and women, in some cases different sex
[01:36:27.049 --> 01:36:32.272]  Even literally going in the pants and taking baby's diapers off.
[01:36:32.272 --> 01:36:42.057]  I mean, it is beyond dark satire that somebody like Kurt Vonnegut or Robert Heinlein would write in their dystopic, futuristic systems.
[01:36:42.057 --> 01:36:45.158]  And we see things like 1984, The Running Man.
[01:36:45.158 --> 01:36:48.520]  All of this is really being used as a template.
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:50.001]  They've had top psychologists
[01:36:50.661 --> 01:37:06.788]  Point out, as you know, that this groping universally, not just in the US, but in England and other areas now, is training children to have people touch them in a way that previously, you know, you say, you know, stranger danger, bad man, bad woman, don't touch me.
[01:37:06.788 --> 01:37:08.909]  This is literal pedophile training.
[01:37:09.369 --> 01:37:20.102]  And they know exactly what they're doing and now the TSA is ending up out on the highways of America and just demanding that they get in our comfort zone.
[01:37:20.102 --> 01:37:25.408]  And now we've learned they're medicalizing police under federal grants to begin blood draws on highways.
[01:37:25.408 --> 01:37:27.371]  This is all about getting in our comfort zone.
[01:37:28.092 --> 01:37:32.273]  Yeah, I mean, you look at that and then you look and you ask a similar question.
[01:37:32.273 --> 01:37:51.460]  A few months ago, say at the start of 2011, would we have believed that elected governments in Italy and Greece would be, by now, replaced by technocrats, bankers, who've never seen a ballot box in their life?
[01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:59.044]  Um, what's happening, and I've been talking about this for years, it's basically, what will they take?
[01:37:59.044 --> 01:38:03.686]  So, and this is very, very relevant to what I'm seeing in Hawaii too.
[01:38:03.686 --> 01:38:05.567]  What will the public take?
[01:38:05.567 --> 01:38:08.849]  Keep pushing, keep pushing, and if you don't meet resistance...
[01:38:09.309 --> 01:38:10.670]  Then push some more.
[01:38:10.670 --> 01:38:12.890]  No resistance, push some more.
[01:38:12.890 --> 01:38:18.913]  This is why people have got to understand that this is where we are now.
[01:38:18.913 --> 01:38:21.374]  It's not where it's due to end.
[01:38:21.374 --> 01:38:25.375]  It's just the latest stage on the road to where they want it to end.
[01:38:25.375 --> 01:38:27.756]  Now, ladies and gentlemen, at what point
[01:38:27.756 --> 01:38:34.699]  At what point are we going to resist in big enough numbers to make the resistance effective?
[01:38:34.699 --> 01:38:41.002]  Are we going to wait until there's a knock on the door and the truck's outside for the concentration camp?
[01:38:41.002 --> 01:38:42.483]  Do you think we might resist then?
[01:38:42.483 --> 01:38:49.987]  What about when they take your children away because there's an emergency and force you to work doing whatever job the government says?
[01:38:50.327 --> 01:38:56.810]  That takes over your transport, that takes over the airwaves, that takes over the energy supplies, that takes over your home.
[01:38:56.810 --> 01:39:05.394]  At what point are we going to say enough, in enough numbers, to be effective and make a difference?
[01:39:05.394 --> 01:39:08.255]  Because that's the question people have got to ask.
[01:39:08.255 --> 01:39:18.300]  We have got to, I would suggest Alex, move, in terms of people understanding of the conspiracy and awareness of the conspiracy, from the point
[01:39:18.980 --> 01:39:26.506]  Most people once were, where they're completely ignorant of the fact there is a conspiracy.
[01:39:26.506 --> 01:39:48.104]  And then, thanks to a lot of work by a lot of dedicated people, that information has started circulating in very, very large amounts, and suddenly we've moved to another stage with a lot of people, where they're now standing on the other side of the street, and now they're aware enough of the game to watch their own prison being built.
[01:39:48.504 --> 01:39:51.287]  So, oh yes, I'll tell you what they're going to do next.
[01:39:51.287 --> 01:39:53.510]  I told you, I knew they'd do that.
[01:39:53.510 --> 01:40:01.739]  Now, we've moved from not knowing the prison is being built around us to seeing it being built around us, but it's still being built around us.
[01:40:01.739 --> 01:40:06.644]  So we need to cross the road and start engaging with it in large numbers.
[01:40:06.644 --> 01:40:07.525]  Get organised.
[01:40:07.525 --> 01:40:07.866]  You're right.
[01:40:08.086 --> 01:40:19.471]  You're right, the first... ...campaigns of non-cooperation with the system because it can't survive and it can't prosper and it can't work unless it has our acquiescence.
[01:40:19.471 --> 01:40:20.772]  Well said.
[01:40:20.772 --> 01:40:25.274]  First we've got to get people awakened and we're deep into that process now.
[01:40:25.274 --> 01:40:34.719]  Then we have to get people to take action and the system knows that we're entering that phase but dealing with the issue of the awakening
[01:40:35.379 --> 01:40:45.045]  When you were speaking about the takeover of infrastructure, the takeover of media, the shutting down of free speech, this is happening everywhere now.
[01:40:45.045 --> 01:40:49.508]  And what you were mentioning was the new executive order Obama just signed two weeks ago.
[01:40:49.508 --> 01:40:51.990]  Similar things are being done in the Euro.
[01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:54.091]  They're appointing the leaders now.
[01:40:54.091 --> 01:40:58.734]  The Economist magazine, the Financial Times of London are saying it's good to have appointed leaders.
[01:40:58.734 --> 01:40:59.775]  So there's this attempt
[01:41:00.555 --> 01:41:05.300]  To now hide everything in plain view, but I don't see it working.
[01:41:05.300 --> 01:41:10.665]  Take the shooting of the poor Jewish children and the commandos in France.
[01:41:10.665 --> 01:41:17.432]  It came out day one, and now it's even the Jerusalem Post and Italian newspapers that the guy was working with French intelligence.
[01:41:17.432 --> 01:41:18.714]  He was protected.
[01:41:18.714 --> 01:41:20.696]  Somebody else videotaped it.
[01:41:20.696 --> 01:41:22.778]  The whole thing was staged to get Sarkozy in.
[01:41:23.098 --> 01:41:26.260]  I mean, now, it isn't taking months for that to come out.
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:29.803]  It's immediately coming out it's a false flag.
[01:41:29.803 --> 01:41:33.686]  Now it's coming out the Hatari militia weren't planning attacks.
[01:41:33.686 --> 01:41:35.387]  And it was all a setup.
[01:41:35.387 --> 01:41:37.889]  And the judge did the right thing and is saying drop the charges.
[01:41:40.891 --> 01:41:47.937]  A crisis point is being reached and I see the system trying now to kind of hide things in plain view.
[01:41:47.937 --> 01:41:55.243]  They've gone from denying it to hiding it in plain view and I see some people out there that say, oh there's no hope, oh the elite are invincible.
[01:41:55.243 --> 01:41:56.685]  I'm finding the opposite.
[01:41:57.245 --> 01:42:04.090]  I'm finding that when we do get off our knees, as your last book was called, that all we have is power.
[01:42:04.090 --> 01:42:07.673]  All we do is win if we don't care about the ridicule.
[01:42:07.673 --> 01:42:18.061]  It's almost like a spiritual thing, that if you give in to the ridicule when you're called a conspiracy theorist for questioning known liars, then somehow that gives power to the other side.
[01:42:18.061 --> 01:42:23.346]  But when you know you're telling the truth and speak out against it and take action, it's having incredible things.
[01:42:23.346 --> 01:42:25.147]  I want to get into your experience in Hawaii.
[01:42:25.247 --> 01:42:29.369]  You said before it went on air, you want to talk about this point of nowhere to run.
[01:42:29.369 --> 01:42:46.576]  But before we do that, why do you think Petraeus has come out and admitted what we've known for a decade, that all new appliances have tech, data over power line, listening, watching, Google watching, beyond 1984, cell phones, toasters, clock radios.
[01:42:47.757 --> 01:42:53.821]  They're now admitting life extension and life reversal that the elite have, that cloning for decades.
[01:42:53.821 --> 01:42:56.083]  Speak on those issues as we get into more.
[01:42:56.083 --> 01:42:57.864]  It's cheesy, but I gotta say it.
[01:42:57.864 --> 01:42:58.965]  Don't touch that dial!
[01:42:58.965 --> 01:43:00.086]  We'll be right back!
[01:43:00.902 --> 01:43:05.444]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:43:05.444 --> 01:43:06.365]  Number one.
[01:43:06.365 --> 01:43:09.786]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:43:09.786 --> 01:43:10.647]  Number two.
[01:43:10.647 --> 01:43:15.529]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:43:15.529 --> 01:43:16.270]  It's true.
[01:43:16.270 --> 01:43:20.812]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:43:21.132 --> 01:43:21.953]  Number 3.
[01:43:21.953 --> 01:43:25.555]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:43:25.555 --> 01:43:29.478]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:43:29.478 --> 01:43:30.259]  Number 4.
[01:43:30.259 --> 01:43:33.041]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:43:33.041 --> 01:43:36.364]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:43:36.704 --> 01:43:41.629]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:43:41.629 --> 01:43:46.693]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:43:46.693 --> 01:43:50.877]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:43:50.877 --> 01:43:52.659]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:43:52.659 --> 01:43:57.263]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:44:02.657 --> 01:44:06.618]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:44:06.618 --> 01:44:15.479]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:44:15.479 --> 01:44:20.100]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:30.922]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:44:31.562 --> 01:44:41.067]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:44:41.067 --> 01:44:46.509]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:44:46.509 --> 01:44:53.993]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:44:53.993 --> 01:44:56.414]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:45:01.098 --> 01:45:02.159]  I had tried everything.
[01:45:02.159 --> 01:45:07.663]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:45:07.663 --> 01:45:12.487]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:45:12.487 --> 01:45:18.872]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:45:19.332 --> 01:45:30.561]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:45:30.561 --> 01:45:35.045]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:45:35.045 --> 01:45:41.310]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:45:41.310 --> 01:45:42.431]  Now that's results.
[01:45:42.851 --> 01:45:55.375]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[01:45:55.375 --> 01:45:57.935]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[01:45:57.935 --> 01:45:59.196]  Infowarsteam.com
[01:46:00.509 --> 01:46:01.831]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:46:01.831 --> 01:46:07.417]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:46:07.417 --> 01:46:12.443]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:46:12.443 --> 01:46:12.904]  It's true.
[01:46:12.904 --> 01:46:17.469]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:23.212]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:46:23.212 --> 01:46:25.533]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:46:25.533 --> 01:46:30.335]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:46:30.335 --> 01:46:31.455]  And here's the best part.
[01:46:31.455 --> 01:46:34.517]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:46:34.517 --> 01:46:37.818]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:46:38.138 --> 01:46:41.322]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:46:41.322 --> 01:46:43.544]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:46:43.544 --> 01:46:44.485]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:46:44.485 --> 01:46:44.685]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:46:44.685 --> 01:46:48.129]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:46:48.129 --> 01:46:49.891]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:47:01.792 --> 01:47:08.587]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:47:10.848 --> 01:47:16.809]  Why are you still alive, A, and B, at the very highest level of human control on this planet?
[01:47:16.809 --> 01:47:22.110]  And, of course, the elite believes they're interfacing with these dark entities, and that's what all the religions say.
[01:47:22.110 --> 01:47:28.731]  But the point is, and when you say it, though, you're kooky and bad because you have a different angle on it, according to the mainstream media.
[01:47:28.731 --> 01:47:36.013]  Why are we still alive, A, and then B, at the human level, what is the highest secret society order?
[01:47:36.013 --> 01:47:37.513]  Who is the most evil person on Earth?
[01:47:37.853 --> 01:47:42.597]  Well, on the second, I don't think we know because they don't put themselves on public display.
[01:47:42.597 --> 01:47:56.728]  I mean, I think at the core of the core of the core, where I say they directly interact with these entities that are described in every ancient culture and every religion has them, demons, archons, jinn, whatever you are.
[01:47:57.728 --> 01:48:04.171]  They don't put themselves on public display, but the House of Rothschild is absolutely right up there.
[01:48:04.171 --> 01:48:10.013]  And they are a major, major influence.
[01:48:10.013 --> 01:48:15.715]  And what they've done brilliantly through the 20th century to now is taken the in-your-face
[01:48:16.495 --> 01:48:24.697]  They've increased their control, but they have hidden it so that the Rothschilds are kind of a faded force.
[01:48:24.697 --> 01:48:25.178]  They're not.
[01:48:25.178 --> 01:48:26.438]  They're right up there.
[01:48:26.438 --> 01:48:31.299]  And I love the thing, Alex, about why are you still alive.
[01:48:31.299 --> 01:48:34.500]  I mean, what ultimate defeatism.
[01:48:34.500 --> 01:48:40.062]  People said to me over the years, if you were genuine, you'd be dead.
[01:48:40.062 --> 01:48:44.503]  All right, so the only genuine conspiracy researcher is a dead one, right?
[01:48:45.043 --> 01:48:56.175]  So we don't have the feeling that actually we can take the power to take the system on and be effective against the system because we don't think the system is all bloody powerful.
[01:48:56.175 --> 01:48:56.675]  No, no.
[01:48:56.675 --> 01:48:57.496]  Oh, no.
[01:48:57.496 --> 01:48:57.796]  No, no.
[01:48:57.796 --> 01:48:59.218]  It is all powerful.
[01:48:59.218 --> 01:49:00.700]  Therefore you would be dead.
[01:49:00.700 --> 01:49:01.801]  They wouldn't let you do this.
[01:49:01.801 --> 01:49:04.684]  Well, there are other forces at work as well.
[01:49:04.684 --> 01:49:06.385]  You know, we look out.
[01:49:07.466 --> 01:49:13.752]  In this tiny frequency range we call visible light, which is barely, buddy, you know, existing.
[01:49:13.752 --> 01:49:21.117]  And we think that everything we see in the human form on Earth is the only one that exists and it's the only reality.
[01:49:21.117 --> 01:49:23.740]  There are multiple infinite realities.
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:26.222]  Religions talk about them in their own way.
[01:49:26.222 --> 01:49:27.262]  And there are many, many
[01:49:28.243 --> 01:49:28.463]  I don't
[01:49:58.223 --> 01:50:05.386]  Well, I was about to say this is a cognitive dissidence, Cass Sunstein type idea that we can't win.
[01:50:05.386 --> 01:50:07.107]  Anybody who's successful is bad.
[01:50:07.107 --> 01:50:13.089]  You're just saying humanity is crap when history shows us the opposite.
[01:50:13.089 --> 01:50:17.831]  And what are people saying who are saying there's nobody good who's standing up?
[01:50:17.831 --> 01:50:20.052]  They're saying their crud as well.
[01:50:20.052 --> 01:50:22.973]  Because I always say, OK, let's just say I'm bad, which I'm not.
[01:50:23.573 --> 01:50:25.053]  I mean, I'm pure of heart.
[01:50:25.053 --> 01:50:27.394]  I'm not a perfect person, but I really do love people.
[01:50:27.394 --> 01:50:29.354]  I really do want to have a better world.
[01:50:29.354 --> 01:50:31.475]  I want our species to go to the stars.
[01:50:31.475 --> 01:50:34.616]  I mean, I'm a fan of man.
[01:50:34.616 --> 01:50:35.656]  I'm a fan of humanity.
[01:50:35.656 --> 01:50:37.256]  I believe in humanity.
[01:50:37.256 --> 01:50:41.798]  And then these people just say, oh no, you couldn't be successful, you know, without the New World Order.
[01:50:41.798 --> 01:50:42.678]  Okay, fine then.
[01:50:42.678 --> 01:50:43.078]  I'm bad.
[01:50:43.678 --> 01:50:48.380]  Don't use the fact that I'm bad as an excuse for you to not take action.
[01:50:48.380 --> 01:50:52.481]  You know you're supposedly good, and everybody else is a bad New World Order.
[01:50:52.481 --> 01:50:54.522]  Come on, stand up and take action.
[01:50:54.522 --> 01:50:59.304]  Instead of just spending all day attacking everybody else that's trying to do something.
[01:50:59.304 --> 01:51:02.225]  And then you find out, oh, they're the operatives.
[01:51:02.225 --> 01:51:03.726]  They're the cognitive dissidents.
[01:51:03.726 --> 01:51:04.766]  They're the COINTELPRO.
[01:51:05.206 --> 01:51:14.110]  And the good news is people have gotten wise to that, and I've seen all the attacks I've gone through, you've gone through, and others have gone through, has actually just become advertising for us.
[01:51:14.110 --> 01:51:16.812]  I mean, in a way, the enemy is stupid.
[01:51:16.812 --> 01:51:21.454]  I mean, I guess they're fighting an old game where people were in a trance state, but...
[01:51:22.194 --> 01:51:24.535]  People are not in a trance state anymore.
[01:51:24.535 --> 01:51:26.195]  At least those that are awake aren't.
[01:51:26.195 --> 01:51:31.796]  And the folks that are still in a trance, I'm sorry, they're not even on the game board here.
[01:51:31.796 --> 01:51:32.797]  They're spectators.
[01:51:32.797 --> 01:51:37.258]  I mean, I'm in the arena, and I have come to wake some people up.
[01:51:37.258 --> 01:51:44.900]  The thing that people need to understand more than anything else is all this conspiracy, all this enslavement.
[01:51:44.900 --> 01:51:47.580]  It is not a bloody game.
[01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:48.520]  It's real.
[01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:50.701]  And if we don't focus on that,
[01:51:54.842 --> 01:52:01.384]  David, David, let me interrupt you just for a moment and then I want you to continue on this line because it's not that I'm mad at my detractors.
[01:52:01.384 --> 01:52:03.965]  Again, they actually help us get the word out in a weird way.
[01:52:03.965 --> 01:52:05.446]  That's how the universe works.
[01:52:05.446 --> 01:52:07.726]  No weapon formed against us shall prosper.
[01:52:07.726 --> 01:52:14.909]  And I see them more as like hobbyists who think that if they spend all their time critiquing other people who are
[01:52:15.689 --> 01:52:17.850]  The word hobby I think is very significant because
[01:52:45.382 --> 01:52:56.090]  It is like a hobby, it is like an add-on to people's lives, and we're dealing with a situation where it has to become the focus of people's lives.
[01:52:56.090 --> 01:53:06.979]  If anyone's got children and grandchildren, and you say, oh, I just want to do the best for my children, well, this has got to be the focus of your life then, if that's your motivation.
[01:53:07.299 --> 01:53:08.900]  Not an add-on.
[01:53:08.900 --> 01:53:15.526]  It is slightly interesting and certainly not just winning points.
[01:53:15.526 --> 01:53:17.007]  I see it all the time.
[01:53:17.007 --> 01:53:19.949]  See, I know more about this conspiracy than you do.
[01:53:19.949 --> 01:53:25.594]  It says bong bong postings or whatever on a forum.
[01:53:25.594 --> 01:53:27.875]  They're just playing at it.
[01:53:27.875 --> 01:53:29.697]  It's a playground at that level.
[01:53:29.997 --> 01:53:33.418]  And we need adults, not children, involved.
[01:53:33.418 --> 01:53:37.839]  And I just ask them, please, look around you.
[01:53:37.839 --> 01:53:39.259]  Look at what's happening.
[01:53:39.259 --> 01:53:53.983]  Stop being a juvenile and start being an adult so you can actually make a difference instead of being just an add-on to your life and a bit of fun and a bit of a hobby.
[01:53:53.983 --> 01:53:55.303]  This is not a game.
[01:53:56.143 --> 01:54:07.153]  This is real, and if we don't treat it as such, and focus on it as such, and support each other as such, then we're going to regret it for a very long time.
[01:54:07.153 --> 01:54:07.694]  Exactly.
[01:54:07.694 --> 01:54:12.018]  I mean, pediatric cancer, some of them are up 10,000 percentage points.
[01:54:12.018 --> 01:54:17.122]  I go out in public and there's kids with shaved heads, with chemo injectors on their arms everywhere.
[01:54:17.122 --> 01:54:18.503]  I mean, they're murdering us.
[01:54:20.345 --> 01:54:27.147]  You know what, I'm here trying to wake people up, and I know a lot of them are operatives, but others are just screwed up people, and it's like, sick!
[01:54:27.147 --> 01:54:28.627]  It's like, wow!
[01:54:28.627 --> 01:54:30.528]  You know, we've got, this is real.
[01:54:30.528 --> 01:54:31.748]  I'm putting my life on the line.
[01:54:31.748 --> 01:54:32.628]  You are.
[01:54:32.628 --> 01:54:34.229]  We know how, this is not a game.
[01:54:34.229 --> 01:54:35.829]  I got chills when you said that.
[01:54:35.829 --> 01:54:37.490]  Truer words have never been said.
[01:54:37.490 --> 01:54:46.032]  Yeah, I mean, you know, all you can do is try to get these people to see what they're doing, you know.
[01:54:47.512 --> 01:54:50.813]  They think they're so informed, a lot of them.
[01:54:50.813 --> 01:54:52.313]  Say, I know more than you do.
[01:54:52.313 --> 01:54:54.514]  Well, how informed are you?
[01:54:54.514 --> 01:54:55.894]  Let me ask the question.
[01:54:55.894 --> 01:55:04.235]  Apart from making attacks on people on forums and stuff like that, what do you actually do to make a difference?
[01:55:04.235 --> 01:55:12.377]  Because if you really knew what was happening and what is planned, then your focus would be on making a difference.
[01:55:12.777 --> 01:55:19.902]  Not lambasting someone and winning brownie points in some intellectual bloody nonsensical game that they play.
[01:55:19.902 --> 01:55:25.246]  You would see that we have to focus on this and make it the focus of our lives.
[01:55:25.246 --> 01:55:31.611]  So if you're not doing that, don't tell me you understand the conspiracy because you clearly don't.
[01:55:31.611 --> 01:55:32.512]  Very powerful.
[01:55:32.512 --> 01:55:33.593]  The thing is...
[01:55:33.993 --> 01:55:49.280]  That when people are in ignorance of what's happening in the world and what the agenda is and where they want it to go, I have some sympathy when they do nothing because they do not believe there's anything to be done.
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:56:01.445]  When I see people who, often for not their own efforts but the efforts of others, have seen what the agenda is, seen what they want to
[01:56:03.386 --> 01:56:16.416]  Impose upon the world, see what they're imposing now, and their only response is to attack and undermine those that are putting their head above the trench and making a difference.
[01:56:16.416 --> 01:56:28.745]  Well, I say to those people, go and find your children and grandchildren, look them in the eye, and justify, given what world they're going to live in, if it reaches the end that they want.
[01:56:29.805 --> 01:56:31.586]  Far beyond what we've got now, even.
[01:56:31.586 --> 01:56:33.027]  Far, far beyond.
[01:56:33.027 --> 01:56:40.390]  And you justify to them attacking and trying to undermine, often exploit, those who are trying to make a difference.
[01:56:40.390 --> 01:56:45.212]  That ignorance, therefore no action, I can understand.
[01:56:45.212 --> 01:56:52.375]  Knowing at least a good part of what's happening and then seeking to undermine those who are trying to expose it.
[01:56:52.375 --> 01:56:54.216]  That turns my stomach.
[01:56:54.216 --> 01:56:58.378]  And one day, one day, when they wake up, it will turn their own.
[01:56:58.618 --> 01:56:59.638]  Yeah, it's bad luck.
[01:56:59.638 --> 01:57:03.520]  My gut just tells me those people have no idea what they're buying into.
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:07.361]  Because when you know the truth and decide to join evil, that is the ultimate sin.
[01:57:07.361 --> 01:57:19.085]  Well, I think, Alex, that what's happening is we're all learning more, we're all becoming more aware, and therefore, you know, you become closer and closer to understanding
[01:57:19.805 --> 01:57:24.748]  What needs to be said and what needs to be done and, you know, we must go on doing that, you know.
[01:57:24.748 --> 01:57:33.952]  I see people over the years at various conferences and I've seen them make presentations and that's very nice, yes, that's interesting.
[01:57:33.952 --> 01:57:39.015]  But I've seen them ten years later making the same presentation and I'm thinking, what have you been doing?
[01:57:39.015 --> 01:57:44.037]  The cutting edge has to constantly move and it's moving very, very fast now.
[01:57:44.037 --> 01:57:45.378]  It's great, great time to be alive.
[01:57:45.779 --> 01:57:46.561]  It certainly is.
[01:57:46.561 --> 01:57:50.091]  Well, David, thank you for the time, and I look forward to speaking to you again in the future.
