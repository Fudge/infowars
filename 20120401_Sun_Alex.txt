[00:00.000 --> 00:16.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so
[00:16.440 --> 00:23.440]  does he live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex
[00:23.440 --> 00:31.360]  Jones welcome my friends welcome thank you all for joining us on this April
[00:31.360 --> 00:38.920]  1st 2012 Sunday transmission and no there's not gonna be any April fools
[00:38.920 --> 00:43.800]  jokes today so don't be looking for that we've got too much serious information
[00:43.800 --> 00:48.600]  going on in this society to play games with people but we do have a very
[00:48.600 --> 00:54.600]  special premier transmission for you this Sunday we're gonna be airing some
[00:54.600 --> 01:01.760]  segments that have not been on the radio yet namely my analysis of the occultic
[01:01.760 --> 01:07.240]  slash off-world systems that the elite believe in not saying I believe in it
[01:07.240 --> 01:11.080]  it's what they believe in just like pygmies believe in worshipping rocks
[01:11.080 --> 01:15.440]  and plants as animus doesn't mean I believe in that but as a sociologist
[01:15.440 --> 01:18.680]  anthropologist and someone trying to understand what the globalist are doing
[01:18.680 --> 01:23.720]  what the psychopaths are doing I study it and our discoveries about this
[01:23.720 --> 01:28.760]  upcoming Ridley Scott film Prometheus are nothing less than amazing that's
[01:28.760 --> 01:34.960]  gonna be a little 10-minute piece coming up later in the transmission but I
[01:34.960 --> 01:40.520]  guess at the end of this hour is we're gonna be airing that also I interviewed
[01:40.520 --> 01:44.840]  rock legend Billy Corrigan founder of the smashing pumpkins and also prolific
[01:44.840 --> 01:48.960]  songwriter it's been a really popular interview that we aired last week for
[01:48.960 --> 01:54.600]  prison planet TV viewers that's gonna premiere here on the radio for all to
[01:54.600 --> 01:59.560]  be able to hear it I did an incredible interview what last Thursday just a
[01:59.560 --> 02:05.600]  couple days ago with David Ike and that was only for prison planet TV viewers
[02:05.600 --> 02:08.480]  for from time to time I like to air stuff especially here on the Sunday
[02:08.480 --> 02:12.440]  show that was probably the best interview I've ever done with him and he
[02:12.440 --> 02:15.560]  talked about a wide range of subjects and David Ike's coming up that kind of
[02:15.560 --> 02:20.600]  dovetails with the whole Prometheus situation we'll be doing David Ike in the
[02:20.600 --> 02:25.320]  last two segments of the second hour and Dave Mustaine we had an in-depth
[02:25.320 --> 02:29.520]  interview a few weeks ago again very very popular a big newsmaker and why is
[02:29.520 --> 02:32.520]  that important it got people talking about real issues you know when people
[02:32.520 --> 02:36.000]  find out these celebrities are listeners their entire fan base starts
[02:36.000 --> 02:41.480]  tuning in to what we're doing and it just shows the solidarity of Liberty
[02:41.480 --> 02:45.120]  lovers and that there's so many people awake and concerned with what's
[02:45.120 --> 02:52.960]  happening on our planet today so that is coming up as well but it is April 1st
[02:52.960 --> 02:59.600]  hard to believe we're already into the fourth month of 2012 the fourth month of
[02:59.600 --> 03:06.800]  2012 that is all coming up today and more on this special Sunday edition look
[03:06.800 --> 03:11.240]  I didn't really cover the Trayvon Martin thing very much in the last week or
[03:11.240 --> 03:16.200]  two I covered it a little bit and I said look it's a media hype hoax it's sad
[03:16.200 --> 03:22.000]  what happened to him we don't know the full story but the media is trying to
[03:22.000 --> 03:27.960]  create a race war here and now it's becoming clear and clear every time I
[03:27.960 --> 03:32.760]  walk by the three or four televisions I say three or four because sometimes one
[03:32.760 --> 03:38.240]  of them in on that are on different so-called news channels ABC CBS NBC you
[03:38.240 --> 03:41.800]  know we watched the nightly news we're here sometimes to monitor it but Fox is
[03:41.800 --> 03:49.120]  on CNN MSNBC CNBC that's all they're talking about not the depression not
[03:49.120 --> 03:53.040]  the dollar devaluation none of it and it's tens of thousands of people
[03:53.040 --> 03:59.120]  marching in LA and in Florida and Spike Lee you know giving out it's one thing
[03:59.120 --> 04:03.080]  to Twitter somebody's house and say go get them that's bad enough and if I did
[04:03.080 --> 04:10.320]  that I'd be arrested but now Twittering the wrong people's house and the media
[04:10.320 --> 04:14.840]  playing into this and and trying to build it up and then media matters saying
[04:14.840 --> 04:19.680]  Matt drudge of drudge report.com is a lot is a racist because he posted one of
[04:19.680 --> 04:24.760]  the more recent photos of Trayvon you know Sport in the Grill and all that and
[04:24.760 --> 04:28.280]  you know older and bigger and then of course it turned out it was a real photo
[04:28.280 --> 04:35.080]  but it's just it's it's crazy how the system is engaged in divide and conquer
[04:35.080 --> 04:37.960]  so I'm gonna come back hit that a little bit and we're gonna get into the
[04:37.960 --> 04:45.440]  Billy Corrigan the breakdown of Prometheus the David Ike all of this is
[04:45.440 --> 04:49.400]  gonna be quite a transmission want to say great job to the crew as well in

[07:03.880 --> 07:10.000]  where I take clips special news reports special interviews from info wars
[07:10.000 --> 07:13.960]  nightly news that there's five nights a week seven o'clock central at info

[07:38.680 --> 07:42.040]  right now if you want to see nine years of material I mean it's an archive
[07:42.040 --> 07:45.720]  plus you're supporting alternative media that's stomping the dinosaur media into
[07:45.720 --> 07:49.360]  the ground but that said big transmission lined up for you we've got
[07:49.360 --> 07:53.200]  Dave Mustaine it was on the nightly news in studio with us a few weeks ago this
[07:53.200 --> 07:56.560]  hadn't been on radio yet it made dozens of major newspapers reported on it
[07:56.560 --> 07:59.600]  Rolling Stone you name it talked about it but the point is Dave Mustaine
[07:59.600 --> 08:04.920]  unchained unleashed we're gonna have some excerpts of that coming up first we're
[08:04.920 --> 08:09.040]  gonna have some Billy Corrigan of Smashing Pumpkins legend a famous songwriter
[08:09.040 --> 08:12.560]  very popular interview when he was here for stop by Southwest he's a listener
[08:12.560 --> 08:15.480]  we hooked up he came in for an hour-plus interview we're gonna air some
[08:15.480 --> 08:20.480]  highlights of that and he's got his new record coming out of Oceania soon so a
[08:20.480 --> 08:24.200]  first look at some of that with Billy Corrigan and his political views on Al
[08:24.200 --> 08:28.760]  Gore global warming the New World Order all of it and then I'm gonna get into
[08:28.760 --> 08:34.400]  Prometheus I've gotten some behind-the-scenes intel on this and it's
[08:34.400 --> 08:38.520]  the big Ridley Scott alien prequel and it really ties into what the elite
[08:38.520 --> 08:42.800]  believe is real I don't believe it but the elite believe that they're
[08:42.800 --> 08:47.600]  channeling off-world spacemen and so when you see this movie that's coming up
[08:47.600 --> 08:51.520]  that's basically what you're seeing is a story of creation that a lot of the top
[08:51.520 --> 08:55.600]  globalist actually believe is real so they're kind of giving you a revelation
[08:55.600 --> 08:59.640]  or the method or what they're into kind of chariots of the gods you know they're
[08:59.640 --> 09:04.000]  practically falling out of the sky that's coming up and I think the best
[09:04.000 --> 09:07.000]  interview of it I've ever done with David Ike that is parts of that are
[09:07.000 --> 09:10.440]  coming up I did it just a few nights ago on the nightly news was in-depth it was
[09:10.440 --> 09:14.320]  almost an hour long on a host of subjects David Ike love him hating
[09:14.320 --> 09:20.120]  interesting fellow and it ties into the whole Prometheus situation so that's
[09:20.120 --> 09:23.720]  your jam-packed transmission this Sunday I gotta just say this on the Trayvon
[09:23.720 --> 09:27.200]  Martin thing I'm gonna really cover this more Monday because this is getting
[09:27.200 --> 09:31.560]  out of control on the Monday a weekday show from 11 to 2 central 11 a.m. to 2
[09:31.560 --> 09:35.440]  p.m. Central this is getting out of control with Spike Lee last week
[09:35.440 --> 09:38.920]  Twittering you know here's where he lives go get him and it wasn't even the
[09:38.920 --> 09:42.320]  right house it's totally illegal to say here's where somebody lives go get him
[09:42.320 --> 09:46.200]  it's totally illegal to have the Black Panther Party the new Black Panther
[09:46.200 --> 09:51.920]  Party say give us money 10,000 people arrest him grabbing I mean regardless of
[09:51.920 --> 09:55.840]  what's going on here you don't say go get somebody all I know is if I did that
[09:55.840 --> 10:00.040]  I'd be arrested and a lot of the Trayvon case it's turned out that black
[10:00.040 --> 10:04.040]  witnesses I've seen them on the news his neighbors are like well no the guy in the
[10:04.040 --> 10:07.400]  red shirt had the guy with the hoodie on top of him hitting him I mean that's on
[10:07.400 --> 10:12.000]  record but once Jesse Jackson launches once Al Sharpton launches to get a bunch
[10:12.000 --> 10:15.520]  of attention and threaten race war basically is what's going on here and
[10:15.520 --> 10:19.800]  once the establishment media gets into it with this divide and conquer it is off
[10:19.800 --> 10:24.760]  to the races just like with a lacrosse situation with Duke turned out that was
[10:24.760 --> 10:29.120]  all made up did they apologize for that no so is there such a situation as
[10:29.120 --> 10:31.920]  driving while black or walking while black yeah I think blacks get
[10:31.920 --> 10:35.440]  discriminated against some sometimes I'm sad that happens I'm not denying that
[10:35.440 --> 10:40.800]  that doesn't go on but the hoax here is the giant media response to all this and
[10:40.800 --> 10:44.600]  it being the number one story we've got so many other issues going on and then
[10:44.600 --> 10:49.040]  Paul Watson had an article in info wars.com just a few days ago Twitter
[10:49.040 --> 10:53.560]  it's spamming celebrities not okay but advocating murder is fine yeah they'll
[10:53.560 --> 10:57.360]  block us putting YouTube videos on Twitter and Facebook criticizing Obama
[10:57.360 --> 11:02.480]  sometimes or criticizing other things just mainline criticism but you want to
[11:02.480 --> 11:06.520]  spam some people know it's not going to happen but social networking giant
[11:06.520 --> 11:10.920]  maintains kill Zimmerman page that's George Zimmerman the guy that shot Trayvon
[11:10.920 --> 11:15.720]  Martin despite massive condemnation I mean this is out of control the media
[11:15.720 --> 11:20.120]  Obama when he was a senator worked with his cousin Odinga in Kenya we have the
[11:20.120 --> 11:24.240]  letters on a Senate letterhead telling him to cause riots between black
[11:24.240 --> 11:27.440]  Muslims and Christian Muslims they'll use any division they can black white
[11:27.440 --> 11:30.720]  religion whatever rich poor north south male female it's
[11:30.720 --> 11:34.600]  vulcanization divide and conquer they said in these letters he said cause
[11:34.600 --> 11:37.680]  riots you'll get a seat in the government and then Kenya created the
[11:37.680 --> 11:41.200]  Prime Minister ship just for Odinga and I'm starting to think especially with
[11:41.200 --> 11:45.560]  MSNBC and others that what I said a week ago that I said this could be a moved
[11:45.560 --> 11:49.360]  towards race war or threatening one as an October surprise in the election now
[11:49.360 --> 11:53.120]  I'm starting to think they may be really trying to do it and that I'm not
[11:53.120 --> 11:55.320]  just starting to think it I think that's what they're trying to do in fact I
[11:55.320 --> 11:59.720]  think it's clear that's what's happening I'm like 98% sure now and that's why
[11:59.720 --> 12:03.200]  Obama's getting all these civil emergency provisions and stuff ready it is
[12:03.200 --> 12:08.040]  wild so we'll talk more about that later in the transmission and tomorrow 11 a.m.
[12:08.040 --> 12:12.960]  and if you don't have a local M&F in your area and FullWars.com or XM-166 but
[12:12.960 --> 12:17.160]  let's go ahead and go to just the beginning of the Billy Corrigan interview
[12:17.160 --> 12:20.160]  that will come back and give you more of that from the M. FullWars Nightly
[12:20.160 --> 12:26.440]  News. Billy Corrigan the founder of Smashing Pumpkins is in studio with us
[12:26.440 --> 12:31.640]  to talk about the media music what's happening right now and what he sees in
[12:31.640 --> 12:34.880]  the future Billy great to have you in studio with us. Thank you Alex happy to
[12:34.880 --> 12:39.000]  be here. Wow you're here for South by Southwest how you like it? It's a little
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.640]  crazy as you know as a Austin person it's a all of a sudden all the beard
[12:43.640 --> 12:47.680]  people showed up the trendies as you call them right lots of trendy showed up
[12:47.680 --> 12:52.040]  with beards and white vans. I did notice that and then like pastel pinks and
[12:52.040 --> 12:57.720]  greens. Yeah. Prancing. I didn't see that but I did see a lot of people like this
[12:57.720 --> 13:00.600]  with the cell phones you know. Oh and they walk out in front of traffic. Yeah.
[13:00.600 --> 13:04.280]  Well it's good to have you here tell us about the speech you were here giving and
[13:04.280 --> 13:07.920]  you had a little run-in with Al Gore. I did I did well technically speaking I
[13:07.920 --> 13:12.120]  made the president the former vice president wait for me which is pretty
[13:12.120 --> 13:18.720]  funny. It's a little payback for for something from the past but yeah I was
[13:18.720 --> 13:24.600]  here a conference social media and how it's changing the business models. In
[13:24.600 --> 13:27.680]  essence it's essentially revolutionizing the business models because the
[13:27.680 --> 13:31.760]  consumers in essence talking back and so it's about where the music industry
[13:31.760 --> 13:35.320]  sort of got it wrong in the last ten years. When you know with the rise of
[13:35.320 --> 13:38.360]  Napster the music business kind of covered their ears and thought it was
[13:38.360 --> 13:41.680]  all going to go away and it's really hollowed out the music business in many
[13:41.680 --> 13:46.960]  ways and so there is there is a movement there that needs to be headed. I'm not
[13:46.960 --> 13:50.440]  saying I'm the head of it but I'm part of a core group artist that wants to come
[13:50.440 --> 13:54.560]  back to where artistic expression and integrity is sort of at the core of the
[13:54.560 --> 13:58.160]  music business. It was a good business model for a long time there was there
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.520]  were a lot of flaws but essentially a lot of great work was created and now you
[14:02.520 --> 14:05.400]  talked to most people particularly 20-year-olds they're just not very
[14:05.400 --> 14:11.280]  connected to their music because the corporate aspect of it and the and the
[14:11.280 --> 14:14.440]  message behind it is really alienated a lot of people and they've turned other
[14:14.440 --> 14:18.160]  things they turn to video games they turned it but you know music no longer
[14:18.160 --> 14:22.040]  has that sort of special place in the culture. It has you know seemed to lose
[14:22.040 --> 14:26.840]  that real rebel quality that you saw across the board in music just 20 years
[14:26.840 --> 14:31.720]  ago we were talking about that at dinner last night how did that happen? Well I
[14:31.720 --> 14:37.040]  think anytime you have a corporate interest becomes the dominating theme I
[14:37.040 --> 14:41.000]  mean it's a central theme of what you talk about in your broadcasts where
[14:41.000 --> 14:44.840]  corporate interest is taken over America. I mean you can go back to the founding
[14:44.840 --> 14:47.880]  fathers of America they were working their own corporate interests I mean it
[14:47.880 --> 14:52.320]  had a lot to do with the decisions they made in in Philadelphia in the late
[14:52.320 --> 14:57.760]  1700s but it was balanced against a set of constitutional rights and the idea
[14:57.760 --> 15:02.400]  that well this particular model a free model a great society is going to heal
[15:02.400 --> 15:06.760]  the greater result and as you like to point out many times I mean America was
[15:06.760 --> 15:10.840]  an incredibly successful experiment for a long time it evolved and then somewhere
[15:10.840 --> 15:14.880]  along the way we've kind of just gone like that where corporate interest is
[15:14.880 --> 15:18.440]  completely taken over our political structure and it's also taken over our
[15:18.440 --> 15:22.880]  musical structure where you have I mean yes it's a business as somebody once
[15:22.880 --> 15:27.000]  said it is a music business but when it when it when it is the prime driving
[15:27.000 --> 15:30.360]  force well then of course you're going to get into things that are salacious and
[15:30.360 --> 15:35.440]  and in essence overtly negative to the culture because they're just serving a
[15:35.440 --> 15:38.480]  particular interest and there is a point where we all have to be responsible
[15:38.480 --> 15:42.560]  for our community standard we all have to be responsible for the messages we put

[15:51.760 --> 15:56.360]  somewhere if you're off your complete intention is to do nothing but profit

[16:59.680 --> 17:05.120]  a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had
[17:05.120 --> 17:08.880]  a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[17:08.880 --> 17:13.000]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the
[17:13.000 --> 17:16.520]  United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely

[19:21.840 --> 19:25.360]  the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[19:25.360 --> 19:29.120]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four

[20:07.520 --> 20:17.040]  Network the Alex Jones show because there is a war on for your mind we are
[20:17.040 --> 20:19.800]  back ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this April 1st
[20:19.800 --> 20:23.960]  transmission sorry we don't have any tracks for your disinformation we don't
[20:23.960 --> 20:27.680]  do that like the mainstream press-at-toot media no we just give you more
[20:27.680 --> 20:32.120]  exclusive interviews with the smashing pumpkins founder Billy Corrigan here's
[20:32.120 --> 20:35.640]  some more of it you mentioned the founders and I think he really brought up
[20:35.640 --> 20:38.640]  a point that I've thought about a lot but never articulated but reading their
[20:38.640 --> 20:42.520]  writings and what they did they were inventors they were really into knowledge
[20:42.520 --> 20:46.560]  and sure they were you know corporate businessmen but they were really into the
[20:46.560 --> 20:50.760]  fact that we're so confident we're so smart we're not intimidated by other
[20:50.760 --> 20:56.640]  people having freedom they were kind of in and talked about this wild experiment
[20:56.640 --> 21:00.480]  freedom and you look at the corporate structures globally today they are scared
[21:00.480 --> 21:04.440]  to death of any freedom and so they're stifling that I think that's really
[21:04.440 --> 21:11.640]  pretty simple but at the same time it's complex well I think from a political
[21:11.640 --> 21:16.600]  standpoint anywhere where you see dissent being stifled what where is the fear
[21:16.600 --> 21:23.520]  I mean why is the fear there most people I talked to that would say have a
[21:23.520 --> 21:26.720]  problem with the government they don't sit around and talk about anarchy or
[21:26.720 --> 21:31.200]  overthrowing the government they just want to see a government that represents
[21:31.200 --> 21:37.160]  their sort of community value and and and I'm not necessarily one side or the
[21:37.160 --> 21:41.120]  other you know I I've got people in my family they're total right-wing
[21:41.120 --> 21:45.160]  Republicans some of them are probably been racist but they at least have a
[21:45.160 --> 21:48.760]  particular opinion that they're coming from that is rooted in their own belief
[21:48.760 --> 21:53.320]  system when all you have is corporate interest driving something well then
[21:53.320 --> 21:56.880]  it's got nothing to do with belief it's about looking at you and saying how can
[21:56.880 --> 22:02.120]  I strip this man or this woman or this family of their resources and that
[22:02.120 --> 22:06.760]  particular aspect is sort of haunting to us as Americans because even if we were
[22:06.760 --> 22:10.640]  raised in propaganda which you and I probably were we're at least raised to
[22:10.640 --> 22:15.200]  believe America's a great country it represents these values you know we
[22:15.200 --> 22:20.600]  freed the slaves we you know we helped to stop the Holocaust you know we grew up
[22:20.600 --> 22:23.800]  with a sense of personal ethic about what our cup country represents a
[22:23.800 --> 22:29.400]  corporate globalism is so cold-blooded it's so robotic well yeah and I mean you
[22:29.400 --> 22:34.760]  address it you know with with great frequency and I think I use that word
[22:34.760 --> 22:38.280]  again there's sort of a haunting feeling it's like like I get it like I get you
[22:38.280 --> 22:41.880]  want to make money you know I get you want to sell me something but it's it's
[22:41.880 --> 22:45.520]  when it's at the expense of my community when it's at the expense of the values
[22:45.520 --> 22:49.200]  of the people around me and you know people don't even talk to their
[22:49.200 --> 22:52.640]  neighbors and they're also locked into this we talked about last night kind of a
[22:52.640 --> 22:58.080]  narcoleptic state where the TV is enough or the computer is enough that's a
[22:58.080 --> 23:05.880]  scary thing you know and so there is a connection there between kind of stifling
[23:05.880 --> 23:12.280]  dissent you know what did Obama say coming in I want to run this great open
[23:12.280 --> 23:15.880]  government transparent was I believe the word they used and and now you've seen
[23:15.880 --> 23:19.360]  where they they go out of their way to stifle dissent I don't it's the most close
[23:19.360 --> 23:23.240]  government right but I but what I say from an artistic point of view and as
[23:23.240 --> 23:26.600]  somebody who's been in the media and at the top levels of media and of course I
[23:26.600 --> 23:31.320]  know plenty of things that go on behind the scenes why are we so afraid of that
[23:31.320 --> 23:34.760]  dissent you know what what is the problem I mean isn't at the point of a
[23:34.760 --> 23:37.960]  democracy you're supposed to have a kind of a riotous debate about who's right
[23:37.960 --> 23:41.360]  there should it should be an uncomfortable conversation there should be
[23:41.360 --> 23:45.080]  kind of a that's the whole point exactly they're always saying well you can have
[23:45.080 --> 23:47.760]  your free speech as long as it's not uncomfortable or as long as long as long
[23:47.760 --> 23:52.760]  as it's 300 feet down the road yeah away from where the limo is going the in the
[23:52.760 --> 23:56.640]  back door you know but but it is the uncomfortable speech that's what's
[23:56.640 --> 24:00.000]  really important yes and that's why I appreciate what you're doing I think you
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.200]  raise a lot of points that are uncomfortable but they're necessary
[24:03.200 --> 24:06.560]  towards the greater dialogue about where country is at the moment and where
[24:06.560 --> 24:10.800]  it's going and of course as as alternative media which you know you're a
[24:10.800 --> 24:15.920]  pioneer in as it reveals a different narrative than we've been sold there's
[24:15.920 --> 24:19.280]  an awareness and awakening that goes on because you start looking at history and
[24:19.280 --> 24:22.960]  go okay wait a second that thing I was told about this maybe that's not so true
[24:22.960 --> 24:26.320]  and then you start looking at things from a different point of evaluation I
[24:26.320 --> 24:31.160]  think the biggest mistake we all make is trying to find a form of absolutism
[24:31.160 --> 24:36.480]  there is no one truth there is no one definitive black and white answer there's
[24:36.480 --> 24:41.280]  this fear that's rising up around the discussion and that to me that's a
[24:41.280 --> 24:47.120]  that's a big red flag well the system knows that is it consolidates power
[24:47.120 --> 24:51.480]  people subconsciously are smart and understand there's a threat so the system
[24:51.480 --> 24:56.320]  is very adept at projecting people's natural anxiety over things going in the
[24:56.320 --> 25:00.960]  wrong direction on to some boogeyman and and the and the social engineers they
[25:00.960 --> 25:07.800]  know that we talked a lot we went to dinner last night Billy about media
[25:07.800 --> 25:11.520]  tricks or trying to keep people in the box and you know when you were speaking
[25:11.520 --> 25:16.200]  about it you know all these data points were coming to my mind it was you were
[25:16.200 --> 25:20.880]  absolutely on target with how they're trying to control reality speak to that
[25:20.880 --> 25:28.360]  well I can use my own example you know I'm essentially lower middle class you
[25:28.360 --> 25:32.840]  know no one for my family went to college obviously have some gifts that are
[25:32.840 --> 25:39.200]  valuable the minute I entered into a bigger wider swath of media I was sort
[25:39.200 --> 25:44.000]  of categorized and when I resisted the categorization I was demonized you know
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.200]  now somebody would say well that's just rock and roll but having been in that
[25:48.200 --> 25:52.400]  game for 20 years there is this overt pressure to put yourself in that
[25:52.400 --> 25:56.680]  particular narrative and if you won't you will be sort of labeled intact and
[25:56.680 --> 26:01.640]  it's fascinating for me now to go back and read articles about myself from 18
[26:01.640 --> 26:05.280]  years ago where I'm sort of being put into categories and labeled a certain
[26:05.280 --> 26:09.160]  way and and then it's that weird thing it's like a Kafka you know you're
[26:09.160 --> 26:12.320]  accused of a crime you don't know what you did that was so wrong and then you
[26:12.320 --> 26:17.360]  spend the rest of your life defending it and and so I'm very keen to watch how
[26:17.360 --> 26:23.520]  other people are demonized from media entry points when somebody rises up with
[26:23.520 --> 26:28.080]  a grand new idea the way it's either co-opted you know like oh let's say
[26:28.080 --> 26:32.560]  let's let's assume for the sake of argument that the Occupy Movement started
[26:32.560 --> 26:37.080]  as an organic expression of somebody you know somebody said let's do this ten
[26:37.080 --> 26:42.560]  people four people you saw right away where it was co-opted or or other
[26:42.560 --> 26:46.920]  media forces tried to disclaim it and distance and those are the ways that the
[26:46.920 --> 26:50.560]  media sort of tries to take things that they can't control and put it in a box
[26:50.560 --> 26:55.240]  and then they start to write the right the articles what does this mean
[26:55.240 --> 27:01.280]  Bloomberg comes out and says Occupy New York is bad for business so the
[27:01.280 --> 27:06.000]  common person says oh that's hurting us well in the greater expression of
[27:06.000 --> 27:10.240]  freedom maybe it's a good thing that we're having this descent maybe the
[27:10.240 --> 27:14.760]  small downside of blocking traffic or something in the in the greater whole is
[27:14.760 --> 27:19.720]  a necessity exactly I mean of America five percent of the world population
[27:19.720 --> 27:22.640]  developed half the wealth because it had more freedom than anybody else not that
[27:22.640 --> 27:28.080]  we were perfect then how is it bad that people are exercising their liberty even
[27:28.080 --> 27:32.000]  if they don't have all the answers at least they're trying to get involved so
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.080]  the real question is why is Bloomberg demonizing it or or or the or the way
[27:37.080 --> 27:41.400]  Homeland Security coordinated to try to take down everybody's protests you know
[27:41.400 --> 27:47.680]  I think those are all a really bad big red flag why are they so scared of people
[27:47.680 --> 27:52.120]  even exercising their first amendment that's a really that's a question I
[27:52.120 --> 27:55.240]  don't have the answer for I think it's one of those things where you can only
[27:55.240 --> 27:59.440]  look at the reaction to gauge that there there must be really something vital
[27:59.440 --> 28:04.120]  going on or there wouldn't have been such a an anti there wouldn't have been
[28:04.120 --> 28:07.160]  such a violent reaction against the Occupy movement if what the Occupy
[28:07.160 --> 28:11.840]  movement was was representing in as a whole wasn't threatening to somebody you
[28:11.840 --> 28:16.120]  know and that's why they try to sort of categorize it down into boxes it's bad
[28:16.120 --> 28:21.320]  for business it could lead to violence it hasn't yet but it might you know this
[28:21.320 --> 28:27.400]  kind of implied nuance yet it was mostly just a bunch of people intense you know
[28:27.400 --> 28:32.360]  and I particularly didn't agree with all of the Occupy message I'm not here to
[28:32.360 --> 28:35.600]  wave the flag for it I think there's certain aspects of troubling troubling
[28:35.600 --> 28:40.000]  aspects about it particularly the idea of wealth distribution you know in my
[28:40.000 --> 28:43.960]  particular instance you know I came from a family that didn't have anything
[28:43.960 --> 28:48.920]  everything I've earned in life I made myself with songs that I wrote so when
[28:48.920 --> 28:52.240]  somebody starts talking about how I've got to give to somebody that didn't do
[28:52.240 --> 28:55.360]  that what that's it that's a deeper conversation it doesn't mean I don't
[28:55.360 --> 28:58.560]  have a social concern it doesn't mean I don't want to contribute to charities it
[28:58.560 --> 29:01.520]  doesn't mean I don't want to help my fellow man

[30:13.040 --> 30:17.960]  had that I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be

[33:18.280 --> 33:24.560]  all right folks coming up Dave Mustaine David Ike the Prometheus review and
[33:24.560 --> 33:26.760]  more
[33:29.200 --> 33:34.000]  Billy you were telling me last night that more and more you realize that the
[33:34.000 --> 33:39.880]  answer to just pure empty commercialism to put words in your mouth is is a
[33:39.880 --> 33:44.080]  spiritual understanding of course you're gonna find that in a church or in some
[33:44.080 --> 33:49.480]  box but I mean for you your your spiritual walk your spiritual awakening I
[33:49.480 --> 33:54.160]  tend to agree with you I think that's really the answer to this artificial
[33:54.160 --> 33:59.000]  system is people tuning into the fact that we're in a limitless universe yeah
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.680]  I find it inspiring sometimes when you talk about how when you're not really
[34:02.680 --> 34:05.960]  sure what to do you go outside and look at the stars and you become you know
[34:05.960 --> 34:10.480]  integrated with the cosmos you realize your place in it and I think that's
[34:10.480 --> 34:15.960]  what we all have to do we can't be so selfish as to not consider others we
[34:15.960 --> 34:19.840]  can't be so selfish as to not think that what we do in irresponsibility doesn't
[34:19.840 --> 34:22.680]  have an impact on somebody else you know there's that you've seen the
[34:22.680 --> 34:25.680]  commercial or the thing in the movie where the guy knocks over the bottle and
[34:25.680 --> 34:29.440]  somehow 14 steps down and you know somebody gets hit by a blast or something
[34:29.440 --> 34:34.080]  there is a continuity in quantum physics to what we do the power of intention
[34:34.080 --> 34:40.200]  the laws of attraction and I think you know and by no means a criticism but
[34:40.200 --> 34:44.800]  we discussed it in terms of your program I think that it kind of like I
[34:44.800 --> 34:49.000]  alluded to before we all have to start thinking what success looks like if we
[34:49.000 --> 34:52.400]  don't like the system that's in place and hopefully we'll be able to engage
[34:52.400 --> 34:59.160]  your democracy to change it that would be my hope what does success look like
[34:59.160 --> 35:02.640]  what does it what does a healthy democratic system look like in 2012 I
[35:02.640 --> 35:05.560]  mean we're a far away from it and I bet if you pulled a hundred people on the
[35:05.560 --> 35:09.920]  street most people would say our democracy is is is in need of an update
[35:09.920 --> 35:14.200]  but it isn't like these jerk-offs right now on there the Constitution doesn't
[35:14.200 --> 35:18.160]  work anymore you start see those articles start popping up constitutions
[35:18.160 --> 35:22.580]  outdated the Constitution is not outdated we left it is the problem yes so a
[35:22.580 --> 35:28.320]  return to constitutional values emphasis on liberty and freedom not being
[35:28.320 --> 35:32.880]  afraid of innovation and new ideas rigorous debate but what does that look
[35:32.880 --> 35:36.080]  like let's say let's say we could wave a magic wand and we have the democracy
[35:36.080 --> 35:40.320]  that we can be proud of what does that look like in 2012 I think we need to
[35:40.320 --> 35:44.600]  start focusing on that because the power of intention is strong you know we
[35:44.600 --> 35:48.960]  have to see what what happiness looks like and we'll know where they're to go
[35:48.960 --> 35:52.160]  left and right as we walk down this I agree with you that's the biggest part
[35:52.160 --> 35:55.280]  I'm missing is I'm just trying to get people to wake up and see the attack
[35:55.280 --> 36:00.040]  we're under but you're right you've got to have something to sell against that
[36:00.040 --> 36:05.720]  right and I and I and I see interesting things you know I see where people are
[36:05.720 --> 36:10.080]  doing co-op farming people are forming collectives people are getting together
[36:10.080 --> 36:14.360]  to pray they're forming their own churches if they don't trust their own
[36:14.360 --> 36:17.200]  church they said well let's just have our own church doesn't matter what
[36:17.200 --> 36:20.520]  denomination exactly and they're creating their own media and if you look at it
[36:20.520 --> 36:23.360]  we're talking to the car today they're attacking the individual farms and
[36:23.360 --> 36:26.680]  co-ops here in Austin who will buy in their own cows sharing on their own
[36:26.680 --> 36:31.120]  farms the feds and state are freaking out all over the country people are
[36:31.120 --> 36:33.600]  starting home churches different denominations different religions
[36:33.600 --> 36:38.000]  they're shutting them down with zoning there isn't some community passed the
[36:38.000 --> 36:42.640]  law where you you can't have more than two people together to yeah California
[36:42.640 --> 36:47.440]  and areas of California a call but I mean a Colorado but you're not you're not
[36:47.440 --> 36:51.080]  allowed to assemble in your own house now it was some sort of weird law like
[36:51.080 --> 36:54.800]  that right exactly the reason I'm jibbering in excitement is you're
[36:54.800 --> 36:59.360]  absolutely right the system shows us what's powerful by what they freak out
[36:59.360 --> 37:03.520]  by and they're going after Amish they're going after home churches they're going
[37:03.520 --> 37:07.800]  after backyard gardens hey why do you think there's been a suppression of
[37:07.800 --> 37:11.800]  Native Americans all these years the Native Americans is one of them is one
[37:11.800 --> 37:16.600]  of the richest most incredibly beautiful con cultures ever created on the face
[37:16.600 --> 37:21.960]  of the earth whether you're talking about the Mayores or you know I mean the
[37:21.960 --> 37:26.040]  aboriginals in Australia I mean these people in many ways hold the key to our
[37:26.040 --> 37:31.040]  success and those are those are values that that I really resonate to and
[37:31.040 --> 37:34.320]  they're independent they're not commercial they're the enemy so we need
[37:34.320 --> 37:38.880]  to as a culture as a people who care about liberty care about freedom care
[37:38.880 --> 37:42.600]  about the future of our country we need to start setting that intention and we're
[37:42.600 --> 37:47.160]  never going to go unless something horrible happens I mean you know the
[37:47.160 --> 37:51.320]  iPads a part of our life the cell phones a part of our life this so what does that
[37:51.320 --> 37:54.400]  mean what is how can we use technology in the right ways how can you be an
[37:54.400 --> 37:58.920]  independent reporter how can you create your own systems how can people create
[37:58.920 --> 38:01.960]  their own systems to connect people together how can you use the systems
[38:01.960 --> 38:05.240]  that are in place the Facebook's and the Google pluses how can you use that to
[38:05.240 --> 38:08.680]  your advantage if those systems are going to be there you know I mean instead
[38:08.680 --> 38:12.240]  of just plugging your fingers near well I can use that to your advantage of
[38:12.240 --> 38:17.240]  what you're gonna be spied on but a lot of people say don't use any of the system
[38:17.240 --> 38:22.840]  I say do both build an alternative system and come out of the Babylon but the
[38:22.840 --> 38:26.920]  same time go into the matrix and use its own system against it you know do both
[38:26.920 --> 38:31.560]  mm-hmm I can I having been inside the music business I can I can't agree with
[38:31.560 --> 38:35.320]  you on that well I have to say this I have seen an exponential awakening
[38:35.320 --> 38:39.280]  because I don't claim to be the best at what I do I mean it's the imperfectness
[38:39.280 --> 38:44.480]  though that you basically fits into the larger hole I have seen my own personal
[38:44.480 --> 38:47.640]  success reaching tens of millions of people and there are so many others
[38:47.640 --> 38:51.160]  that are more articulate who have greater gifts than I and I'm seeing them
[38:51.160 --> 38:56.160]  come online and I know that in that true diversity that's what the corporate board
[38:56.160 --> 39:00.720]  can't stop they can play whack-a-mole all day long but they can't stop the
[39:00.720 --> 39:05.560]  signal yeah and this is what I would say in conclusion even if you Alex Jones
[39:05.560 --> 39:09.400]  were wrong about everything you ever opined even if you were wrong the fact
[39:09.400 --> 39:14.040]  that you were willing to put those ideas to create that debate that is the key
[39:14.040 --> 39:19.160]  that's why people shouldn't be so scared of those ideas and and that is the key
[39:19.160 --> 39:23.200]  to our future I think it's not about whether or not you're right I'm wrong
[39:23.200 --> 39:26.980]  that that that is that is that is a system that's put there in our
[39:26.980 --> 39:32.280]  psychology by people who want to control our individual intuitive systems
[39:32.280 --> 39:36.160]  because at the end of the day look people consider and watch us talk for an
[39:36.160 --> 39:41.920]  hour if they think we're wrong great if it's coming from them their own heart
[39:41.920 --> 39:46.360]  if it's coming if people sit here and watch us and they say these guys don't
[39:46.360 --> 39:48.560]  really know what they're talking about and that's coming from inside them
[39:48.560 --> 39:53.400]  that's God speaking through them and maybe we are wrong that's perfectly fine
[39:53.400 --> 39:58.240]  if it's coming from their own internal system of intuition if they're buying a
[39:58.240 --> 40:03.640]  corporate narrative that convinces a convinces them that we're wrong just
[40:03.640 --> 40:07.720]  because we're opening our mouths and we're questioning something that should
[40:07.720 --> 40:10.760]  scare them because that means they're robots that means they've been
[40:10.760 --> 40:13.560]  controlled by somebody along they're actually not they're not thinking their
[40:13.560 --> 40:16.640]  own thoughts they're thinking somebody else and that's our well-ean and that
[40:16.640 --> 40:21.120]  should frighten them what about this point I find a lot of people say you're
[40:21.120 --> 40:24.720]  probably right about this but what are you gonna do about it I choose to join
[40:24.720 --> 40:29.880]  the system they think it's like joining the winning team or a bandwagon when a
[40:29.880 --> 40:33.920]  team is going to Super Bowl well then they buy the jersey or the t-shirt it's
[40:33.920 --> 40:39.600]  almost like they think they can join with this inhuman cold system because
[40:39.600 --> 40:43.680]  they've made a decision I try to explain to them you may delusionally think you're
[40:43.680 --> 40:46.920]  part of the system because you've joined it but it's a system that destroys
[40:46.920 --> 40:51.080]  humanity I mean the only way to win is to resist this and that's why I say
[40:51.080 --> 40:54.640]  resistances victory doesn't mean we have all the answers but we are saying we
[40:54.640 --> 40:59.480]  don't agree with this I think out of that debate will come the answers yeah any
[40:59.480 --> 41:04.720]  system that's devoid of true leadership is troubling and so when I see that in
[41:04.720 --> 41:07.720]  people where they just accept an idea without actually having their own
[41:07.720 --> 41:11.240]  internal debate I mean we've all been in those dinner conversations where you
[41:11.240 --> 41:13.880]  just kind of throw something out in the middle of the table and somebody goes
[41:13.880 --> 41:18.720]  no and you go where did you get that from well I was listening to you know
[41:18.720 --> 41:22.800]  Oprah or something you know I mean they didn't actually have the thought they
[41:22.800 --> 41:25.880]  heard somebody else express and they know I agree with them and they repeat it
[41:25.880 --> 41:29.360]  but but but sometimes it's worse than that they say I hear what you're saying
[41:29.360 --> 41:35.520]  I've talked to engineers one time I was out camping you know at our family you
[41:35.520 --> 41:38.480]  know ranch and I wasn't deer hunting but we had some deer hunters there at least
[41:38.480 --> 41:42.280]  in the property and then they were all engineers and I said well they found two
[41:42.280 --> 41:48.520]  of the passports in the rubble that day that's impossible and they said I hear
[41:48.520 --> 41:53.160]  what you're saying but as an article of faith I can't believe that and I was
[41:53.160 --> 41:56.560]  just like well that's crazy but see with the way I look at stuff like that is if
[41:56.560 --> 42:01.440]  if somebody needs to believe something for themselves that's fine for
[42:01.440 --> 42:05.760]  themselves that's okay because trying to convince somebody of something that
[42:05.760 --> 42:09.520]  they don't want to believe is sort of a fruitless effort anyway but at the same
[42:09.520 --> 42:14.080]  time you have to be careful to preach to acquire so really what were you myself
[42:14.080 --> 42:19.040]  as an artist and you as a as a pioneer and alternative alternative media really
[42:19.040 --> 42:22.600]  what we're talking to people is on the edge who are willing to listen the
[42:22.600 --> 42:26.120]  people aren't going to hear you anyway it's sort of irrelevant you know I mean
[42:26.120 --> 42:28.160]  they're just going to put their fingers in theirs or they're going to create a
[42:28.160 --> 42:31.280]  debate within themselves that's going to negate what no matter what you say no
[42:31.280 --> 42:34.440]  matter how brilliant it is and the people already believe you well in some
[42:34.440 --> 42:37.520]  ways you're just preaching to the choir it's the people live on the edge who are
[42:37.520 --> 42:40.560]  really there they're uncertain of their own personal narrative and they're
[42:40.560 --> 42:43.320]  looking for information those the people that ultimately you're reaching out
[42:43.320 --> 42:46.800]  totally agree so many people go and speak to their family or whatever and
[42:46.800 --> 42:50.040]  they get brushed off think well I'm done trying to wake people up politically
[42:50.040 --> 42:53.880]  spiritually there's always going to be the mass of people that just want to be
[42:53.880 --> 42:57.320]  followers that don't want to hear anything complex just want to go cook
[42:57.320 --> 43:02.960]  their TV dinner and watch dancing with the stars when you're out on the road the
[43:02.960 --> 43:09.680]  last place you want to be is on the road but if the unfortunate happens you'll be
[43:09.680 --> 43:16.000]  glad you were wearing diamond gussets there's a place down in Tennessee

[43:57.760 --> 44:04.200]  others don't a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[44:04.200 --> 44:07.720]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[44:07.720 --> 44:12.040]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[44:12.040 --> 44:15.480]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[44:15.480 --> 44:20.120]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace

[45:06.720 --> 45:10.080]  could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[45:10.080 --> 45:14.000]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[45:14.000 --> 45:18.200]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[45:18.200 --> 45:22.640]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[45:22.640 --> 45:27.400]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[45:27.400 --> 45:31.200]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[45:31.200 --> 45:34.800]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[45:34.800 --> 45:39.160]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[45:39.160 --> 45:42.320]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[45:42.320 --> 45:46.160]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my old sponsors you can

[47:06.800 --> 47:30.840]  Broadcasting Network network. Oh I love that sound all right my friends Alex Jones
[47:30.840 --> 47:35.400]  back with you here thank you for joining us on this April 1st 2012
[47:35.400 --> 47:42.120]  transmission hard to believe we're already into the fourth month of 2012 now
[47:42.120 --> 47:46.520]  I'm a big Ridley Scott fan I want to make that clear here and I think I say
[47:46.520 --> 47:49.680]  that in the news piece we're about to premiere here for the radio audience of
[47:49.680 --> 47:54.080]  the secrets of Prometheus if you want to see the video going along with the
[47:54.080 --> 47:58.880]  audio just go to info wars.com and this little eight-minute special report is
[47:58.880 --> 48:02.680]  posted right there but I want to be clear about something here what I'm about
[48:02.680 --> 48:06.480]  to present here I do not believe because I can't prove it one way or the
[48:06.480 --> 48:11.160]  other what I can prove is that every ancient society thought they were being
[48:11.160 --> 48:15.600]  visited by star gods who were coming to this planet and manipulating human
[48:15.600 --> 48:21.680]  development every culture Aztecs Romans Greeks Babylonians Japanese I mean
[48:21.680 --> 48:25.880]  every culture I don't know if that's true or not all I know is the elite the
[48:25.880 --> 48:31.280]  secret societies today in all of my deep research I run into the fact that they
[48:31.280 --> 48:35.560]  believe they are being directed by off-world intelligences and that humans
[48:35.560 --> 48:39.040]  were genetically engineered that is the secret by the movie Prometheus coming
[48:39.040 --> 48:42.640]  out I've got some inside leaks and stuff I'm not gonna spoil the thing for you but
[48:42.640 --> 48:47.840]  the point is this is not seen as fiction by many top globalist and knowing
[48:47.840 --> 48:51.640]  what's in the film with my contacts this film is one of the closest
[48:51.640 --> 48:55.400]  representations of what the ruling elite actually think it's part of the
[48:55.400 --> 48:59.280]  revelation of the method and you see this in in so many films and Steven
[48:59.280 --> 49:03.280]  Spielberg there's an obsession with it we know there's Project Bluebeam the
[49:03.280 --> 49:06.600]  government admits they have plans to stage alien landings and other stuff to
[49:06.600 --> 49:10.920]  make people submit during crises they have plans to project Jesus or Buddha or
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.400]  Muhammad into the air I mean that's all been declassified the fact that they
[49:14.400 --> 49:18.760]  have those plans the details are classified but the fact that the plans
[49:18.760 --> 49:22.920]  are there is declassified kind of like genetic engineering cloning they now
[49:22.920 --> 49:26.360]  admits been going on for 30 years it was classified now it's not but the
[49:26.360 --> 49:30.760]  tales are still classified so here for the radio audience on this Sunday
[49:30.760 --> 49:37.320]  transmission is the inside scoop the secrets so here it is Ridley Scott
[49:37.320 --> 49:42.600]  arguably one of the greatest living directors is set to release a prequel to
[49:42.600 --> 49:50.240]  his 1979 mega hit alien Prometheus one of the most anticipated sci-fi films in
[49:50.240 --> 49:57.240]  recent memory info wars.com research analysis shows Prometheus is not just
[49:57.240 --> 50:02.920]  a film but a revelation of the method revealing the deepest secrets of the
[50:02.920 --> 50:11.760]  Illuminati mystery religion I do have a lot of contacts in the media as viewers
[50:11.760 --> 50:20.040]  and listeners know and I have been able to secure a copy of an early script and
[50:20.040 --> 50:25.000]  it follows very closely from the trailer I've seen in other leaks I'm not going
[50:25.000 --> 50:31.640]  to give the entire film away here but in synopsis this is a film about the
[50:31.640 --> 50:40.720]  origins of humankind with a super race of near immortal genetic engineers who
[50:40.720 --> 50:47.640]  are contemplating a genetic overwrite or rewrite of the planet Earth when
[50:47.640 --> 50:53.360]  meddling humans stumble in to the magicians laboratory they are punished
[50:53.360 --> 51:00.480]  for their trespass. The so-called space jockey is the advanced species that have
[51:00.480 --> 51:05.440]  engineered humans back on Earth and produced the bio weapon that we know
[51:05.440 --> 51:10.800]  of as the classical alien that burst out of your chest after feeding on the food
[51:10.800 --> 51:15.600]  in your intestines. The reason we're taking time out to examine Prometheus is
[51:15.600 --> 51:22.080]  because its storyline its plot mirrors that of many ancient societies and the
[51:22.080 --> 51:28.040]  ideas presented in Prometheus are at the core of Western secret societies. These
[51:28.040 --> 51:32.360]  are ancient civilizations that were separated by centuries and yet this
[51:32.360 --> 51:36.400]  same pictogram was discovered in every one of them please tell me you can read
[51:36.400 --> 51:43.840]  that. Across the world we see evidence of early civilizations obsession with
[51:43.840 --> 51:48.280]  what they believed were off-world influences from the Nazca lines in
[51:48.280 --> 51:55.120]  South America to the pyramids of Egypt we see artifacts testament to early man's
[51:55.120 --> 52:02.400]  obsession with off-world manipulators. Every ancient culture believed they were
[52:02.400 --> 52:07.600]  communicating with men from the sky. Ezekiel was spinning wheels of fire
[52:07.600 --> 52:13.320]  landing and creatures with blue space helmets approaching Ezekiel and giving
[52:13.320 --> 52:18.240]  him a drug to take and then he has wild hallucinations. One could say that
[52:18.240 --> 52:23.760]  Prometheus is simply art imitating life and putting a 21st century spin on the
[52:23.760 --> 52:29.760]  beliefs of the Dogon tribe in Africa and the Aztecs of Mesoamerica. Eric Von
[52:29.760 --> 52:34.040]  Donoghan more than any other living person has popularized the idea of
[52:34.040 --> 52:39.880]  chariots of the gods and that our planet has been visited and manipulated by
[52:39.880 --> 52:44.520]  off-world creatures for thousands of years but the systems that he popularized
[52:44.520 --> 52:50.720]  were regurgitated whole cloth from ideas developed by the ruling class of this
[52:50.720 --> 52:56.400]  planet and I want to be clear every major globalist we look at going back
[52:56.400 --> 53:03.000]  more than a hundred and sixty years is completely and totally obsessed with the
[53:03.000 --> 53:09.280]  idea that off-world aliens are controlling this planet and giving them
[53:09.280 --> 53:16.440]  hidden knowledge by the 1870s th Huxley group and their x-club was dominating
[53:16.440 --> 53:21.240]  the Royal Society in England the dominant theory within the x-club was
[53:21.240 --> 53:26.040]  that humans had been seated here along with most other life forms by advanced
[53:26.040 --> 53:31.080]  beings from space from the inception of Darwin's theory on the origin of
[53:31.080 --> 53:36.800]  species evolutionary scientist never believed for a minute that life
[53:36.800 --> 53:42.080]  simply started on its own that evolution is not some random slow system
[53:42.080 --> 53:47.400]  developing by chance but is actually directed by off-world cedars
[53:47.400 --> 53:54.360]  terra farmers creators of worlds even the discoverer of DNA Francis Crick
[53:54.360 --> 53:59.960]  promotes the idea that life was seated on this planet in what he calls directed
[53:59.960 --> 54:07.560]  panspermia it is part of the larger myth of transhumanism Huxley Darwin wedge
[54:07.560 --> 54:14.280]  wood the Gaultons they all interbred in an attempt to create this transcendent
[54:14.280 --> 54:23.720]  Superman the governing class of this globe believes that they are channeling
[54:23.720 --> 54:31.040]  advanced technological systems given to them by ancient alien species and the
[54:31.040 --> 54:37.600]  science fiction of the last hundred and fifty years whether Jules Verne or HG
[54:37.600 --> 54:42.680]  Wells or those that came before them is obsessed with this and they're on record
[54:42.680 --> 54:47.200]  part of secret societies who believe what they're promoting is actually
[54:47.200 --> 54:52.200]  reality but knowing that the public is not ready to accept it they cover it
[54:52.200 --> 54:57.280]  under the guise of fiction and the film Prometheus is completely constructed
[54:57.280 --> 55:02.880]  around the secret religion of the Illuminati who believe that they are
[55:02.880 --> 55:10.200]  transcendent and becoming the Superman we can create cybernetic individuals we
[55:10.200 --> 55:16.400]  are the gods now blurring the lines between fiction and reality we see a
[55:16.400 --> 55:20.920]  futuristic presentation of the technology conference Ted the keynote
[55:20.920 --> 55:25.840]  speaker is the founder of the Wayland Corporation mr. Wayland there he
[55:25.840 --> 55:31.200]  describes Prometheus stealing fire from the gods from the Titan Prometheus our
[55:31.200 --> 55:36.520]  first true piece of technology fire the transference of fire or the first
[55:36.520 --> 55:41.920]  technology to man is only the beginning of his transgressions Prometheus is a
[55:41.920 --> 55:47.680]  Titan and the creator of mankind who attempts to elevate humans to the level
[55:47.680 --> 55:53.920]  of gods and is punished the Illuminati believe they have stolen the fire of
[55:53.920 --> 56:00.640]  true genius from the gods biotech nanotech fusion as man attempts to
[56:00.640 --> 56:05.880]  become godlike we release potential forces that can and probably will
[56:05.880 --> 56:12.480]  destroy us I want to say this in summation we're not facing off-world
[56:12.480 --> 56:16.240]  genetic engineers that the elite believes created this planet but that's true
[56:16.240 --> 56:20.840]  or not we're facing the global technocrats that are splicing every
[56:20.840 --> 56:25.520]  plant and animal and insect you can imagine together that are creating
[56:25.520 --> 56:30.560]  chimeras with hundreds of species within them giving rise to superviruses and
[56:30.560 --> 56:36.640]  bacterial mutations we are already seeing within three generations in rodents
[56:36.640 --> 56:43.120]  total sterilization and massive deformities in these animals and we have
[56:43.120 --> 56:47.720]  proven from the Rockefeller Foundation documents and other reports that this
[56:47.720 --> 56:52.960]  is part of a long-term program to wreck the general public's DNA this is the
[56:52.960 --> 56:58.080]  global elite who have fantasized about off-world genetic engineers creating
[56:58.080 --> 57:03.400]  them actually in a hundred and sixty year plus program developing the
[57:03.400 --> 57:08.240]  sciences and technologies to put this into place whatever you say about the
[57:08.240 --> 57:14.480]  Illuminati they have got patience and they have had incredible vision but I
[57:14.480 --> 57:18.720]  believe humanity needs to hear the truth and understand this is being carried
[57:18.720 --> 57:23.720]  out against us all because we have a choice to stand up now but only a short
[57:23.720 --> 57:29.720]  window and say no I know the plot of the film I know how it ends I'm gonna leave
[57:29.720 --> 57:35.920]  that for you to discover the point is the film itself is only a revelation of
[57:35.920 --> 57:40.400]  the method and externalization of the hierarchy
[57:44.800 --> 57:49.360]  that's the inside scoop on Prometheus stay with us we'll be back for the

[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:16.160]  more than a reminder to you that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:21.440]  you're a bug mr. Wordsworth a crawling insect an ugly missformed little
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:28.160]  creature who has no purpose here no meaning I am a human being words mr. Wordsworth
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:34.520]  that have no substance and no dimension like air like a wind I don't care I
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:40.400]  tell you I don't care I'm a human being I exist and if I speak one for a loud
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:46.120]  that thought lives even after I'm shoveled into my grave
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:52.720]  mr. Wordsworth delusions that you inject into your veins to make you think you
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.240]  have a strength when you have no strength at all you have nothing but spindly
[01:00:57.240 --> 01:01:10.440]  limbs of a dream resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones a
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:18.560]  tried it is Sunday April 1st 2012 we're into the second hour thank you so much
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:26.880]  for joining us wow coming up we're going to have Dave Mustaine excerpts of the
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.960]  TV interview I did with him airing here on the radio and then we're gonna have
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:35.040]  two segments with David Ike some of the most important excerpts of what he said
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:41.040]  in an hour long or close to our long interview we did a few days ago but I
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:48.800]  was just thinking about the Prometheus piece that we just aired and how truly
[01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:53.320]  bizarre it is that the leadership of this planet believes that they know the
[01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.840]  secrets to human development and maybe they do maybe they've been passing this
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:01.120]  down through secret societies forever yes the kind of the plot of the fifth
[01:02:01.120 --> 01:02:08.240]  element as well with Bruce Willis and the whatever that lovely actress is what's
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:13.600]  her name the fifth element she's also in all those resident evil movies
[01:02:13.600 --> 01:02:23.320]  something Mia Jovovich other one of God's beautiful creations the point is
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:26.400]  is that we need to have a debate and discussion about the globalist as they
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:29.400]  think they're God and all they're doing is wrecking the planet while lecturing
[01:02:29.400 --> 01:02:32.920]  us all day about how they are going to take all our rights away and kill us to
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:36.600]  protect the planet now really they just like to kill people that's what's going
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:43.400]  on speaking of that the Supreme Court was supposedly has secretly ruled on the
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:46.520]  health care situation and I'm wondering if we're gonna get any leaks on this
[01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:51.040]  maybe there's leaks now I don't know lots of rumors that they're gonna affirm
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:55.560]  government-run eugenics health care you mentioned this criminal government
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:59.160]  controlling what type of health care you're gonna get but they're also saying
[01:02:59.160 --> 01:03:05.720]  that we'll know for sure by late June they have to write their their ruling
[01:03:05.720 --> 01:03:12.960]  their findings down and that will supposedly know this by June but I hope
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.880]  that they don't just strike down parts of it they've got to strike down the
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:24.160]  entire stinking slag heap that is corporate fascist health care written
[01:03:24.160 --> 01:03:27.800]  by the insurance companies to make 35 million people get health care and cut
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:33.040]  down what type of health care they get you know more and more I asked the crew
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:36.880]  when they're looking through the news to give me stacks of news on weird stuff
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:41.040]  that's confirmed but bizarre and you've got to look at this story we've got it up
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:46.080]  at info wars.com did a sea monster wash up on South Carolina coast and it's a
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:51.920]  giant thing that looks like looks like it looks like that I have a science
[01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:57.480]  fiction movie it looks like the brain bug and I'm not talking about Webster
[01:03:57.480 --> 01:04:01.840]  Tarpley I'm talking about that's a secret nickname I've now released he's
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:07.880]  awesome so smart I'm not the brain bug from others bookworms there's also brain
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:15.640]  bugs but there's also the brain bug from Starship Troopers remember that one this
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:19.760]  looks like the brain bug residents in South Carolina coastal town believe
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:22.960]  they're dealing with a whole different kind of sea monster than an alarmingly
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:26.520]  large strange-looking body of some kind of aquatic creature washed up on the
[01:04:26.520 --> 01:04:32.080]  coastal states folly beach man that's weird looking and and what's strange
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.680]  about it is they thought seal of cancer been extinct for millions of years and

[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:04.640]  info wars.com a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:08.160]  even if I had a pretty good-sized meal that I was still starving and my
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:12.520]  research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:15.920]  crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:20.560]  almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:25.200]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.960]  healthy I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there

[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:39.200]  well my fellow info warriors and truth seekers we've got a real treat for you
[01:06:39.200 --> 01:06:45.800]  tonight in studio here in Austin Texas here in the bunker with us is Dave
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:51.320]  Mustaine founder of mega death one of the first members of Metallica known as
[01:06:51.320 --> 01:06:55.480]  one of the greatest guitars of all time and he's a patriot who loves liberty and
[01:06:55.480 --> 01:07:00.400]  loves this country and loves God I tell you I love Dave Mustaine he just ended
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:05.200]  his big gigantor tour huge success David it's great to have you here with us
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:10.360]  thanks Alex good to be here Wow so you just just into the tour here in Austin
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:16.000]  yeah the gigantor 2012 in North America we ended there's no telling how much
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:19.560]  longer gigantor will go in other countries and stuff like that but this
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:25.240]  was the end of the beginning of this year we started on Philadelphia over on
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:30.400]  the east coast and worked up into Canada and across Canada pretty well have a
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:36.000]  Canadian drummer so we all of a sudden became really huge up there good is it
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.920]  just me or is mega death getting bigger than ever because I hear about it all
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:44.320]  the place I hear a lot more on the radio you guys are so prolific and it's
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:50.160]  just even getting better I think we're getting more popular but with what
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:55.880]  happened with unlocking you know the recording industry and everybody being
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:02.760]  able to get records basically it will you we had to kind of focus more on the
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:07.400]  live aspect so I think the hard work touring is paid off because whether
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:12.600]  record sales help a band survive anymore or not you know we're still able to
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:16.520]  continue to get out to the masses because you know good times bad times
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.840]  people like entertainment and funny thing is during you know when it's
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:25.480]  considerably tougher times heavy metal becomes more popular so as things have
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:31.360]  kind of gone in a more difficult period the same way it was during in the 80s you
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:36.520]  know it's cyclical it's the same stuff and and times are getting kind of tough
[01:08:36.520 --> 01:08:41.560]  now and and heavy metal is becoming much more popular again
[01:08:41.560 --> 01:08:50.360]  you know every record it's kind of like a snapshot of your life and and you have
[01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:53.720]  to live life in between records to experience something so that you're not
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:58.800]  just regurgitating the same stupid song and lyrics you know a hundred times
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:05.200]  because people will eventually catch on to that but there's also the fact that
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.440]  when people discover a band in the very beginning that's the band that they hold
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:13.200]  on to very rarely do you see a band go 13 albums into their career like we have
[01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:18.000]  and still continue to generate new fans and you know although you do lose fans
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.280]  on the way that you know they grow up people get married their wives tell
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:24.240]  them stop listening to metal and you know then that's the end of the story or
[01:09:24.240 --> 01:09:30.320]  you know people just they they just start playing it themselves and don't
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:33.680]  listen to it because they make their own music when my space came out there was I
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:39.360]  think at one time I remember there was a study there was eight million MySpace
[01:09:39.360 --> 01:09:43.840]  pages with people that had their own music uploaded on to it and I was
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.240]  thinking like God eight million fans on there and then you know probably seven
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:53.040]  hundred fifty seven and a half million of them suck you know because even that
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:57.400]  five hundred thousand that would have good stuff you've got your whole life
[01:09:57.400 --> 01:10:01.080]  to write your first record you know and when it's time to write your second one
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:04.440]  that's when the pressure's on it wasn't like we just got a different engineer we
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:08.640]  had a new producer working with me so in the beginning it was kind of like alright
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.200]  who's this guy Johnny K you know and and what's he all about you know and he did
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:20.240]  stained and you know that was kind of like those guys and metal is us guys so
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:25.400]  when Johnny came he was recommended by our bassist David Ellison I didn't know
[01:10:25.400 --> 01:10:31.400]  anything about him and you know it was kind of like you two dogs kind of
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.400]  sizing each other up each other up you know although we didn't get into it at
[01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:42.160]  all we became you know fast friends there was some time where I thought you
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:47.320]  know is this gonna work because you know we spent we had eight weeks to make the
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:52.920]  record and we had to do 13 songs and one of the songs had to be done
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:58.280]  immediately for Guitar Hero and I mean for Konami that was the never-dead song
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:04.720]  and sudden death had come out earlier that year we started working on the song
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:07.800]  when David Ellison came back you know we were in the process of doing it for the
[01:11:07.800 --> 01:11:11.360]  game and it was gonna be included in the record so that was actually the first
[01:11:11.360 --> 01:11:16.000]  time that Ellison recorded with a skin in eight years in fact I was gonna bring
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.040]  that a point back I mean it's great to see David back in the band yeah he's
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:24.720]  he's a good dude he's pretty pretty funny you know there's an irony about this guy
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:30.200]  like and he's studying to be a pastor but he swears more than I do you know and
[01:11:30.200 --> 01:11:34.760]  he's in a 12-step program but you know he drinks coffee from morning till night
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:42.520]  you know and you know good thing for me is we're friends I've always cared about
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:46.320]  him even during you know it's a period we went through where we were kind of a
[01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:49.160]  strange from each other you know because when you're in a band together you guys
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.120]  become almost like it's kind of like a weird marriage so to speak like a
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.720]  family kind of thing you know everybody always says that but it usually it
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.800]  breaks up because you know families fracture you can't always expect all
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:06.200]  four people have the same viewpoint and and we didn't at a period of time and
[01:12:06.200 --> 01:12:10.720]  me being the leader I had to make some unpopular decisions and and of course when
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.360]  things go wrong you know it's my fault and when things go great it's everybody's
[01:12:14.360 --> 01:12:18.920]  credit you know so I accepted that early in the game because I knew that was how
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.400]  things were going to be portrayed and when we got back together again after
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:29.920]  you know all the lawsuit and stuff had happened you know Dave Dave had he was
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.320]  contrite about what you know it happened his case against me got
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:38.560]  completely dismissed it and and he actually got really hurt the fans were
[01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:44.120]  really pissed him for suing me and I kept telling him you know I love Dave the
[01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:48.800]  sad thing is that you know the kids are getting hurt in this you know funny
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:52.160]  thing is our kids are so resilient they don't even think about it they get
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:55.760]  together and they're just jumping on each other and you know acting like
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:59.800]  stupid kids so that you know it didn't even affect him I saw him at dinner one
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:02.720]  time and I said you know he said it was the dumbest thing he's ever done and I
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:06.760]  said I forgive you and that was the beginning of the the path back to him
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:10.840]  joining the band again you know we tried a couple times to talk and God's
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.200]  timing just wasn't right you know and when the time was right it was it was
[01:13:15.200 --> 01:13:19.680]  effortless he came in he started playing I was looking through my hair kind kind
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:23.960]  of like trying to clandestinely check him out see if he was you know having
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:29.440]  trouble or if he wasn't into it or if he was enjoying himself or whatnot and it
[01:13:29.440 --> 01:13:33.480]  was pretty cool because it you know give or take you you know some hair colors
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:37.360]  changing or some hair loss you know we're like the same two kids we met
[01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:42.720]  when when we met in Los Angeles back in the 80s I was about to say it it was
[01:13:42.720 --> 01:13:45.600]  great to see him back in the band because I'd always just seen him in photos and a
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:48.320]  couple concerts where I'd seen him you know early on many years ago it was like
[01:13:48.320 --> 01:13:53.440]  wow I remember this guy too this is even great and he's such a nice guy Dave we
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:56.480]  haven't really gotten into politics yet in this interview but you were telling me
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:13:59.520]  just basically about what happened the whole Santorum thing what went on there
[01:13:59.520 --> 01:14:04.440]  well you know it's no secret I've been writing songs about not being happy with
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:09.360]  the way that the peasants are treated in the valley you know and and being one
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.840]  myself you know the lyrics and P cells talks a lot about what my beliefs are
[01:14:12.840 --> 01:14:15.800]  you know I go to work when I have to I go to court when I have to I pay my bills
[01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:19.800]  you know I believe in God you know all the things like our founding fathers
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:25.160]  would have been proud of you know what I mean and I was talking to doing an
[01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:28.920]  interview with this guy innocently enough he asked me when I thought about the
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:33.360]  candidates I went through the Republican candidates and and said what I thought of
[01:14:33.360 --> 01:14:37.000]  each one at the time because it was during that horrible embarrassing smear
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:41.680]  campaign that they were all waging towards each other and I mean seemingly
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:45.960]  like that that everybody was just fighting instead of you know I'm saying
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.880]  well yeah he may not he may have done this but I believe this and I'm gonna
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:54.720]  fight against Obama you know if I told Ron Paul that last time I was on I said
[01:14:54.720 --> 01:14:59.080]  I get you guys all to fight with each other but transcend go after Obama that
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.640]  you know yeah and it's not even going after Obama it's going after the ideals
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:10.800]  that America was founded on and that we you know we have a constitution I saw a
[01:15:10.800 --> 01:15:15.040]  joke the other day someone said that I think Syria was writing a new
[01:15:15.040 --> 01:15:19.000]  constitution and that they could have ours because we don't use it anymore you
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:23.480]  know but to get back to the point you know I was just talking about what the
[01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:30.440]  politics like I did when I did rock the vote you know and the second person who
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:35.960]  picked up the story said I endorsed Rick Santorum and you know I put out a press
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:39.920]  release after that that said I never used the word endorsed I said that I
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:45.680]  liked the guy because he jumped off the campaign trail to go be with his sick
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:52.160]  daughter now that to me whether you're a football player or an astronaut if you
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:16:02.400]  put your family first you get kudos in my book hi this is Alex Jones did you

[01:20:26.360 --> 01:20:37.520]  and coming up David Eich he's got some very interesting stuff to tell us you
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:42.680]  were telling me a story and you were saying you know I see the new up-and-coming
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:45.480]  musicians coming in that are opening for us and then I see some of the older
[01:20:45.480 --> 01:20:50.920]  ones and it's kind of like the prodigal son you're there explaining to them this
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:55.520]  is kind of like you know the stages of life this is the lesson from life what
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:21:00.000]  did you mean by that I mean describe how people come into music how they leave
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:08.000]  music well it's it's hard to to explain to some musicians sometimes when they
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.760]  come in cuz when they come into the music business they've got their whole
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:16.160]  lives to write their first record and but when I say that I mean that you've
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:21.880]  got four or five people sometimes three in a band that have their whole life to
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:25.480]  write their first record and you have a conglomeration of maybe any words from
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:30.680]  10 to 40 or 50 songs that they can weed through but after that process of
[01:21:30.680 --> 01:21:33.800]  elimination you realize a lot of it it's just kind of like you know getting
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.360]  rid of the gristle and the fat and stuff like that and you get down to the real
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.040]  meat of all the songs you kind of have a lot left and then when it's time to do
[01:21:40.040 --> 01:21:44.200]  your second record the pressure is on our second record was peace always but
[01:21:44.200 --> 01:21:49.680]  who's buying and and that was for us way more successful than killing was and as
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:52.840]  we've grown along we've learned a lot of things on the way and then some people
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.480]  you can talk to them they'll listen to you and others they're like you know what
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:21:59.560]  thanks for the information I don't need any more anything from you you know and
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:04.400]  and sometimes I look at him and I and I think well you know you're gonna be in
[01:22:04.400 --> 01:22:07.960]  one of those guys that gets an abandon you know it doesn't mean absolutely
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:12.200]  nothing you know when I got in a band it was to be in a band for life you know I
[01:22:12.200 --> 01:22:18.560]  never intended on having to part ways with Metallica and it happened you
[01:22:18.560 --> 01:22:22.640]  know and I don't intend on parting ways with Megadeth's but you know what at some
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:28.120]  point I'm gonna hang up my guitar and it's just with the stress on my shoulder
[01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:32.440]  and and with the touring that we do the demands around the world I can't keep up
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:36.160]  with it you know it's a great problem to have you know I think God's really
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:40.240]  blessed me in an amazing way all the bad stuff that I've done over my life that
[01:22:40.240 --> 01:22:45.080]  you know just by saying something is significantly and symbolically simple
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:48.280]  it's just saying hey you know I'm not God you are and I'm gonna listen for a
[01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:52.560]  little while and see what happens and you know the road got smooth and and my
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:56.760]  careers turned around I got my best friend back playing bass with me my
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:00.640]  kids like me you know traffic's gotten better you know it's just a whole
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:05.020]  complete paradigm shift in the universe plays before you it's a long way to the
[01:23:05.020 --> 01:23:09.600]  top you want to rock and roll that's right that's right everybody thinks that
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:12.720]  people that are successful even you have talent they go just given to you even
[01:23:12.720 --> 01:23:17.120]  if you've got Zeus lightning bolts it still is a lot of work hey you can be a
[01:23:17.120 --> 01:23:20.600]  great player that doesn't mean you're gonna be in a great band you know the
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:26.000]  alleyways are littered with Olympians and and you know the think that there are
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:29.240]  so many other guitar players that are better than I am so many singers that
[01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:33.360]  are better than I am you know well there are folks better than you at the speed
[01:23:33.360 --> 01:23:36.440]  metal because I've talked to famous guitarists they say wow Dave Mustaine's
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:40.280]  amazing yeah there are plenty I believe my guitar partner is a better guitarist
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:43.600]  than I am I mean I'm a good songwriter because I write from my heart and and you
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:47.120]  know having all those hard knocks and you know the stuff I was telling you
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:51.640]  about the hammy down clothes and stuff you know that whole thing really okay
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:57.760]  there you go you got to tell that story it's it just it gives you character you
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:03.840]  know and you're just just growing up and wanting to fit in you know when you
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.380]  finally get that shot it becomes an e-braining you know and when when I
[01:24:08.380 --> 01:24:12.880]  finally knew I was gonna become something as a musician I felt like you
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:16.480]  know what I'm not gonna be this latchkey kid anymore I'm not gonna be wearing you
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:21.760]  know hammy down clothes I'm not gonna be you know getting food stamps and having
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:25.240]  to get lunch tickets at school and all that stuff that you know you look at a
[01:24:25.240 --> 01:24:28.400]  kid like that in school today and you think like oh he's a low-income punk
[01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:32.320]  he's a brat he's never gonna amount to anything you know and and I was that
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:36.720]  no but but in a way that's good I know like you know these wealthy kids new
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:39.800]  but reach whatever they're even more wrecked because they just they expect
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:43.280]  everything I mean some of the most valuable things in my life I grew up
[01:24:43.280 --> 01:24:46.960]  you know middle-class my parents were so country they didn't even think I needed
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:50.400]  the you know the cool clothes it's like you get your clothes once a year that's
[01:24:50.400 --> 01:24:53.720]  it so when it will sew the holes up in them yeah yeah that's what you get it
[01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:57.720]  wasn't even like they weren't even didn't even know what trendy was yeah but I
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.800]  remember kids making fun me for my clothes but I would I remember was kids
[01:25:00.800 --> 01:25:05.480]  that had flunked three grades ganging up and stomping on me and at the time it was
[01:25:05.480 --> 01:25:08.760]  horrible but I went home my dad wasn't a tough guy but he said well you just
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:12.120]  better kick their ass and it's like I'm not that I'm a tough guy but it's like
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:15.960]  the fact that I learn or stand up for myself and got beat up and had my leg
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:19.640]  broken and all this other stuff that like is really valuable now because now I'm
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:24.480]  not scared yeah you know I've always respected people who are my friends that
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:28.920]  you are willing to say hey you know what what you're doing isn't right because
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:33.200]  you know it could end up in me getting hurt hurting them jeopardizing my
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:37.200]  family's safety of others my career you know there's been some dumb stuff I've
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:41.360]  done jumping out of a perfectly good operating airplane that's not you know
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:44.240]  people just don't think hey I'm gonna grab a backpack and jump out of an
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:48.720]  airplane but that's what I did over and over and over when I was skydiving you
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:52.560]  know and and the thought of that now them a little bit older I was thinking oh
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:56.480]  my god because justice my son had said that he wanted to skydive and I was
[01:25:56.480 --> 01:26:01.240]  thinking oh god how do I tell him not to do this you know because I was crazy at
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:04.880]  the time that I wasn't even supposed to skydive I'd done an interview and again
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:08.720]  English into a foreign language translated back into English I told
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:12.720]  some lady that I wanted to skydive and she said that I did and I was so
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:17.160]  gobble at the time is so conscientious of all the people that were always you
[01:26:17.160 --> 01:26:21.480]  know going after me I thought well I got it I gotta do it so that I don't look
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:25.840]  like a liar you know and and it's sad when you're in that place where people
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:29.560]  have that kind of control over you you know fortunately for me I got healed from
[01:26:29.560 --> 01:26:34.480]  all that but it was fun the first time I skydived well Dave I don't want to
[01:26:34.480 --> 01:26:37.920]  worry out here you've done an incredible job on this interview after this long
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:42.040]  tour and it's just amazing you wanted to tell the Bill Clinton story so let's
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:49.160]  let's close with that oh well I had gone to to the White House because I'd done
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:54.760]  that work with the rock the boat thing and I had gotten asked by some people
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.520]  out in Los Angeles to get involved with that I can't unfortunately can't remember
[01:26:57.520 --> 01:27:02.280]  their name I do remember Dave Sarelnik from MTV was helping me as I did all the
[01:27:02.280 --> 01:27:05.800]  coverage and you know gotten the Democratic National Convention and covered
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.280]  a lot of stuff and talked with a lot of people and and that kind of solidified
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:16.560]  my kind of curiosity that you know as a political writer as a songwriter that
[01:27:16.560 --> 01:27:20.480]  you know I can do something that matters so when we did the rock the vote thing
[01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:24.440]  there was also the motor voter bill that got passed in California it may it may
[01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:27.200]  be in other states around the nation right now I don't know but it made it
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:30.360]  simple for people who had a driver's license to be able to register to vote
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:35.920]  you know voting is a huge part of the democratic process you know I mean you
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:39.760]  watch them vote on cooking shows and stuff like that you know so I thought
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:42.680]  it was important to get involved with that Dwight Yelkin was in on that a lot
[01:27:42.680 --> 01:27:47.160]  of other really cool people were in on that and when it got passed we all got
[01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:50.220]  invited up to the White House and and we went up towards the dudes from living
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:53.080]  color and stuff and I kept thinking about Willie Nelson spoken dope on the
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:56.560]  top of the White House and and I wonder if they still do that you know that kind
[01:27:56.560 --> 01:28:01.880]  of stuff and I had my little coin at the time because I was in a 12-step program
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:08.600]  at the time and and I walked up to President Clinton and I said hello mr.
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:13.120]  Clinton I said this is my coin here and he took it from me stuck in his pocket
[01:28:13.120 --> 01:28:16.320]  I said no no no that's not for you I just wanted you to hold it and give me some
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:21.280]  mojo you know and so he goes oh I'm sorry he handed it back to me and and yeah
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:25.760]  that was my my moment with the president I thought it was pretty cool I think that
[01:28:25.760 --> 01:28:29.680]  it's it's it's something that everybody should aspire to do to make a
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:34.480]  contribution to this great nation for the good of everybody and if you don't
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:38.440]  know the difference between what's what's right and what's wrong it's just
[01:28:38.440 --> 01:28:42.000]  open your mind up there and great outlets like you here some people may not
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:46.640]  agree with everything that you say that's what makes us individuals but
[01:28:46.640 --> 01:28:50.720]  there are a lot of people who are people like you that believe in country and God
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:55.960]  and family and stuff like I know you as my friend and and you know you just got
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:59.000]  to kind of look for the good and stuff you know it's it's right there hidden

[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:05.480]  year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even if I had a pretty good
[01:31:05.480 --> 01:31:09.720]  sized meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact
[01:31:09.720 --> 01:31:13.800]  that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and
[01:31:13.800 --> 01:31:17.800]  across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost

[01:33:16.080 --> 01:33:21.360]  one of my favorite guests David Ike he's got some interesting observations he's
[01:33:21.360 --> 01:33:27.440]  being protested groups don't want him to speak also just before we went on air
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:31.880]  here brought up any TSA adventures he said he's gonna discuss it all and then
[01:33:31.880 --> 01:33:35.160]  I'm gonna talk to him about the new world order throwing everything in our
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:38.520]  face they're now admitting that they don't just have life extension
[01:33:38.520 --> 01:33:43.320]  technologies they have age reversal systems they're admitting that oh your
[01:33:43.320 --> 01:33:48.400]  appliances do have hidden tech in them to spy on you why are they throwing it
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:54.120]  all in our face right now I have my own ideas but we'll get David Ike's take on
[01:33:54.120 --> 01:34:00.560]  that but he is visiting now here in the 50th state Hawaii David joining us via
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:05.680]  audio Skype great to have you David well how was your trip out there what's
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:10.680]  your view on the TSA well it's three quarters around the world for me so it
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:18.000]  was a long trip but I did experience the TSA one or two times already both in
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:23.520]  Los Angeles and then moving around the islands here and you know it was it was
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:28.640]  it was fine I had to pat down and and got you know through and all the rest of
[01:34:28.640 --> 01:34:35.400]  it but what shocked me Alex and what is shocks me every time I come to America
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:39.120]  and indeed you know some other countries that have these full-body
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:44.960]  scanners is to stand there in the line you know shoes off belt off all this
[01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:50.720]  stuff and what's going on you're watching parents take the children through
[01:34:50.720 --> 01:34:57.600]  these full-body scanners it is extraordinary and you know we can
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:04.120]  discuss various definitions of child abuse but I would say that the ignorance
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:11.920]  of subjecting your children to this radiation every time they go through
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:16.680]  an airport with no question come on honey quickly there you go and all this
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:23.320]  stuff no question no thought no question about what the effect on the child
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:27.360]  might be and of course radiation has a greater impact on children for various
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:33.480]  genetic medical reasons it's just extraordinary to me how asleep people
[01:35:33.480 --> 01:35:38.440]  can be and you know people talk about ignorance being bliss while ignorance is
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:41.280]  bliss but only for a while because ignorance always catches up with you
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:47.400]  and and you know ignorance of this the impact of these radiation scanners is
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:52.200]  going to catch up with enormous numbers of people the frequent fliers which of
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:57.280]  course you have so many in America they are picking this stuff up all the time
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:00.640]  day after day after day and the cumulative effect is going to be
[01:36:00.640 --> 01:36:05.560]  devastating but how parents can just allow that to happen to their children
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.800]  is just absolutely extraordinary to me beyond words David can you imagine ten
[01:36:10.800 --> 01:36:13.640]  years ago and we would have told people they're going to put you in naked body
[01:36:13.640 --> 01:36:17.560]  scanners save a naked image of you which they've been caught doing lying of
[01:36:17.560 --> 01:36:21.120]  course and parents are going to let their children be separated from them
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:28.360]  scared and have men and women in some cases different sex even literally
[01:36:28.360 --> 01:36:34.480]  going in the pants and taking babies diapers off I mean it is beyond dark
[01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:38.960]  satire that somebody like Kurt Vonnegut or Robert Heinlein would write in their
[01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:44.440]  dystopic you know futuristic systems and we see things like 1984 the running man
[01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:49.960]  all of this is really being used as a template and they've had top psychologist
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:54.680]  you know point out as you know that this groping universally not just in the U.S.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:59.600]  but in England and other areas now is training children to have people touch
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:04.160]  them in a way that previously you know you say you know stranger danger bad
[01:37:04.160 --> 01:37:09.560]  man bad woman don't touch me this is literal pedophile training and they
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.880]  know exactly what they're doing and now the TSA is ending up out on the highways
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:20.480]  of America and just demanding that they get in our comfort zone and now we've
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:24.240]  learned they're medicalizing police under federal grants to begin blood draws
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:29.480]  on highways this is all about getting in our comfort zone yeah I mean you look at
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:34.760]  that and then you look and you ask a similar question a few months ago I'll
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:42.120]  say you know the start of 2011 would we have believed that elected governments
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:48.840]  in Italy and Greece would be by now replaced by technocrats bankers who've
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:54.200]  never seen a ballot box in their life what's happening and I've been talking
[01:37:54.200 --> 01:38:00.200]  about this for years it's basically what will they take so and this is very
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:05.720]  very relevant to what I'm seeing in a way to what will the public take keep
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:10.760]  pushing keep pushing and if you don't meet resistance then push some more no
[01:38:10.760 --> 01:38:16.480]  resistance push some more this is why people have got to understand that this
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:23.120]  is where we are now is not where it's due to end it's just the latest stage on
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:27.920]  the road to where they want it to end now ladies and gentlemen at what point
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:34.360]  are we going to resist in big enough numbers to make the resistance effective
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:39.600]  are we gonna wait until there's a knock on the door and the trucks outside for
[01:38:39.600 --> 01:38:43.560]  the concentration camp which we might resist then what about when they take
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:48.480]  your children away because there's an emergency and force you to work doing
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:52.120]  whatever job the government says that takes over your transport that takes
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:56.400]  over the airwaves that takes over the energy supplies that takes over your
[01:38:56.400 --> 01:39:04.000]  home at what point are we going to say enough in enough numbers to be
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:07.360]  effective and make a difference because that's the question people have got to
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:13.360]  ask we have got to I would suggest Alex move in terms of people that
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:17.880]  understanding of the conspiracy and awareness of the conspiracy from the
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:25.080]  point that most people once were where they're completely ignorant of the fact
[01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:30.520]  there is a conspiracy and then thanks to a lot of work by a lot of dedicated
[01:39:30.520 --> 01:39:35.840]  people that information has started circulating in very very large amounts
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:39.440]  and suddenly we've moved to another stage with a lot of people where they're
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.440]  now standing on the other side of the street and now they're aware enough of
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:50.560]  the game to watch their own prison being built so oh yes oh I tell you what
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:55.200]  they're gonna do next oh I told you I knew they do that now we've moved from
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:59.160]  not knowing the prison is being built around us to seeing it being built
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:03.200]  around this but they're still being built around us so we need to cross the road
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:07.800]  and start engaging with it in large numbers and get organized you're right
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:12.760]  you're right the first massive campaigns of non-cooperation with the system
[01:40:12.760 --> 01:40:17.480]  because it can't survive and it can't prosper and it can't work unless we have
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:22.960]  it has our acquiescence well said first we've got to get people awakened and
[01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:27.600]  we're deep into that process now then we have to get people to take action and
[01:40:27.600 --> 01:40:34.080]  the system knows that we're entering that phase but dealing with the issue of the
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:38.160]  awakening when you were speaking about the takeover of infrastructure the
[01:40:38.160 --> 01:40:44.040]  takeover of media the shutting down of free speech this is happening everywhere
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:48.200]  now and what you were mentioning was the new executive order Obama just signed
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:52.800]  two weeks ago similar things are being done in the euro they're appointing the
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:56.840]  leaders now the Economist magazine the Financial Times of London are saying
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:01.280]  it's good to have appointed leaders so there's this attempt to now hide
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:07.240]  everything in plain view but I don't see it working take the shooting of the poor
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:12.360]  Jewish children and the commandos in France it came out day one and now it's
[01:41:12.360 --> 01:41:16.240]  even the Jerusalem Post and Italian newspapers that the guy was working with
[01:41:16.240 --> 01:41:20.920]  French intelligence he was protected somebody else video taped it the whole
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:25.640]  thing was staged to get Sarkozy in I mean now it isn't taking months for that
[01:41:25.640 --> 01:41:30.120]  to come out it's immediately coming out it's a false flag it's a now it's
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:34.880]  coming out the Hattari militia weren't planning attacks and it was all a setup
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:41.480]  and the judge did the right thing and is saying drop the charges so so a crisis
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:47.200]  point is being reached and I see the system trying now to kind of hide things
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:51.120]  in plain view they've gone from denying it to hiding it in plain view and I see
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:54.320]  some people out there that say oh there's no hope all the elite are
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:41:59.240]  invincible I'm finding the opposite I'm finding that when we do get off our
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:04.840]  knees as your last book was called that that all we have is power all we do is
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:09.480]  win if we don't care about the ridicule it's almost like a spiritual thing that
[01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:12.120]  if you give into the ridicule when you're called a conspiracy theorist for
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:17.680]  questioning known liars then somehow you know that like gives power to the other
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:21.320]  side but when you know you're telling the truth and speak out against it and
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:24.600]  take action it's having incredible things I want to get into your experience in
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:28.320]  Hawaii as you said before went on air you want to talk about this point of
[01:42:28.320 --> 01:42:33.560]  nowhere to run but before we do that why do you think Petraeus has come out and
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:38.400]  admitted what we've known for a decade that all new appliances have tech data
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:44.440]  over power line listening watching Google watching beyond 1984 cell phones
[01:42:44.440 --> 01:42:49.840]  toasters clock radios they're now admitting life extension and life
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:55.080]  reversal at the elite have that cloning for decades speak on those issues as we
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:59.240]  get into more it's cheesy but I got to say it don't touch that dial we'll be
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:03.880]  right back this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:08.320]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:12.520]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[01:43:12.520 --> 01:43:16.520]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:20.400]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:24.560]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:28.840]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:33.160]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:36.880]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages number
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:41.080]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[01:43:41.080 --> 01:43:44.440]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution

[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:04.720]  I had tried everything I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating I was
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:08.800]  lifting weights and jogging but nothing was working my body was literally

[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:07.160]  storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle
[01:46:07.160 --> 01:46:10.640]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[01:46:10.640 --> 01:46:14.280]  valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even gold and
[01:46:14.280 --> 01:46:18.120]  silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so
[01:46:18.120 --> 01:46:21.680]  our friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of

[01:46:55.200 --> 01:47:01.000]  seeds are the ultimate barter item this is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:07.160]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[01:47:07.160 --> 01:47:14.080]  broadcasting network network why are you still alive a and b at the very
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:17.800]  highest level of human control on this planet and of course the elite leaves
[01:47:17.800 --> 01:47:21.400]  their interfacing with these dark entities and that's what all the
[01:47:21.400 --> 01:47:24.800]  religions say but the point is and when you say it though you're cooking in bad
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.840]  because you have a different angle on it according to the mainstream media why
[01:47:28.840 --> 01:47:34.800]  are we still alive a and then b at the human level what is the highest secret
[01:47:34.800 --> 01:47:38.920]  society order who is the most evil person on earth well of the second I
[01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:42.000]  don't I don't think we know because they don't put themselves in public
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:46.800]  display I mean I think at the core of the core of the core where I say they
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:51.240]  directly interact with these entities that are described in every ancient
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:56.640]  culture and every religion has them demons are cons gin whatever you are
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:00.840]  they they don't put themselves on public display but the house of Rothschild is
[01:48:00.840 --> 01:48:10.480]  absolutely right up there and they are a major major influence and what they've
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:15.840]  done brilliantly through the 20th century to now he's taken the in-your-face
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:21.720]  control they've increased their control but they have hidden it so that the
[01:48:21.720 --> 01:48:26.600]  Rothschilds are kind of a faded force they're not they're right up there and I
[01:48:26.600 --> 01:48:32.280]  love the thing Alex about are we still what why are you still alive I mean what
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:39.200]  ultimate defeatism people said to me over the years if you were genuine you be
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:44.160]  dead all right so the only genuine conspiracy researcher is a dead one
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:49.480]  right so we don't have the feeling that actually we can we can take the power
[01:48:49.480 --> 01:48:54.080]  to take the system on and be effective against the system because we don't think
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:58.840]  the system is he's all bloody powerful no no oh no no no it is all powerful
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:02.600]  therefore you would be dead they wouldn't let you do this well there are
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:09.000]  other forces at work as well you know we look out in this tiny frequency range
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:14.240]  we call visible light which is barely buddy you know existing and we think
[01:49:14.240 --> 01:49:18.840]  that everything we see in the human form on earth is the only one that exists and
[01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:24.440]  it's the only reality there are multiple infinite realities religions talk
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:30.000]  about them in their own way and there are many many levels of reality that are
[01:49:30.000 --> 01:49:34.560]  working to bring an end to what's happening in our in our reality now in
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:42.560]  our world and and they are protecting people who are willing to do what is
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:48.360]  necessary to expose all this and make a difference they are protecting them and
[01:49:48.360 --> 01:49:52.920]  therefore it is not as easy as always saying something we don't like bang bang
[01:49:52.920 --> 01:49:58.880]  it's not and you know we've got to get over this defeatism well I was about to
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:04.720]  say this is a cognitive dissonance cast Sunstein type idea that we can't win
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:10.360]  anybody who's successful is bad you're just saying humanity is crap when
[01:50:10.360 --> 01:50:15.440]  history shows us the opposite and what are people saying who were saying
[01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:19.560]  there's nobody good who's standing up they're saying they're crud as well
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:24.480]  because I always say okay let's just say I'm bad which I'm not I mean I'm pure
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:28.080]  of heart I'm not a perfect person but I really do love people I really do want
[01:50:28.080 --> 01:50:32.360]  to have a better world I wanted our species to go to the stars I I mean I
[01:50:32.360 --> 01:50:37.600]  I'm a fan of man I'm a fan of humanity I believe in humanity and then these
[01:50:37.600 --> 01:50:41.080]  people just say oh no you couldn't be successful you know without the new
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:46.440]  world order okay fine then I'm bad don't use the fact that I'm bad as an excuse
[01:50:46.440 --> 01:50:50.880]  for you to not take action you know you're supposedly good and everybody
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:54.880]  else is a bad new world order come on stand up and take action instead of
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:58.720]  just spending all day attacking everybody else is trying to do something
[01:50:58.720 --> 01:51:03.120]  and then you find out oh they're the operatives they're the cognitive
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:07.480]  dissonance they're the Cointel pro and the good news is people have gotten wise
[01:51:07.480 --> 01:51:10.400]  to that and I've seen all the attacks I've gone through you've gone through
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:13.880]  and others have gone through has actually just become advertising for us I
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:18.440]  mean in a way the enemy is stupid I mean I guess they're fighting an old game
[01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:23.720]  where people were on in a trance state but people are not in a trance state
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:27.680]  anymore at least those that are awake aren't and the folks that are still in
[01:51:27.680 --> 01:51:31.920]  a trance I'm sorry they're not even on the game board here they it is they're
[01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:37.320]  spectators I mean I'm in the arena and I have come to wake some people up the
[01:51:37.320 --> 01:51:41.960]  thing that people need to understand more than anything else is all this
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:48.800]  conspiracy all this enslavement it is not a bloody game it's real and if we
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:53.760]  don't focus on that and focus our lives on it we're gonna regret it for the rest
[01:51:53.760 --> 01:51:57.360]  of our lives David let me interrupt you just for a moment and then I want you
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:01.560]  to continue on this line because it's not that I'm mad at my detractors again
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:04.600]  they actually help us get the word out no weird way that's how the universe
[01:52:04.600 --> 01:52:09.400]  works no weapon formed against us shall prosper and I see them more as like
[01:52:09.400 --> 01:52:14.520]  hobbyist who think that if they spend all their time critiquing other people
[01:52:14.520 --> 01:52:19.520]  who are awakened involved that somehow it's like a scalp that if they've bashed
[01:52:19.520 --> 01:52:23.280]  David Ike or they've bashed Alex Jones or they've told us you know that oh
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:28.920]  they're really a you know an agent or their scum that that somehow it makes
[01:52:28.920 --> 01:52:33.960]  them big men and women and it just makes me so sad for them so it it hurts me
[01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:38.880]  but not in a way that they think it's hurting me it's so pathetic briefly
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:45.600]  your comment on that the word hobby I think is very significant because it is
[01:52:45.600 --> 01:52:51.120]  like a hobby it is like an add-on to people's lives and we're dealing with a
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:56.560]  situation where it has to become the focus of people's lives if anyone's
[01:52:56.560 --> 01:53:00.680]  got children and grandchildren if you and you say oh I just want to do the best
[01:53:00.680 --> 01:53:05.520]  for my children well this has got to be the focus of your life then if that's
[01:53:05.520 --> 01:53:10.480]  your your motivation not an add-on not an or it is slightly interesting and
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:18.000]  certainly not just winning points over I see it all the time see I know more
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:22.400]  about this conspiracy than you do as says bong bong posting so you know
[01:53:22.400 --> 01:53:29.200]  whatever on a forum and they're just playing at it it's a playground at
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:35.200]  that level and we need adults not children involved and I just asked them
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:42.680]  please look around you look at what's happening stop being a juvenile and
[01:53:42.680 --> 01:53:49.120]  stop being an adult so you can actually make a difference instead of exactly an
[01:53:49.120 --> 01:53:54.680]  add-on to your life and a bit of fun and a bit of bit of a hobby this is not a
[01:53:54.680 --> 01:54:01.840]  game this is real and if we don't treat it as such and focus on it as such and
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:06.520]  support each other as such then we're gonna regret it for a very long time
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:11.840]  exactly I mean pediatric cancer some of them are up 10,000 percentage points I
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:15.920]  go out in public nurse kids with shaved heads with with the chemo injectors on
[01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:20.520]  their arms everywhere I mean they're murdering us and and and and you know
[01:54:20.520 --> 01:54:24.480]  what I'm here trying to wake people up and I know a lot of them are operatives
[01:54:24.480 --> 01:54:28.800]  but others are just screwed up people and it's like sick it's like wow you know
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:33.400]  we've got this is real I'm putting my life on the line you are we know how this
[01:54:33.400 --> 01:54:37.120]  is not a game I got chills when you said that true words have never been said
[01:54:37.120 --> 01:54:44.520]  yeah I mean and you know all you can do is try to get these people to see what
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:51.000]  they're doing you know they think they're so informed a lot of them see I
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:56.120]  know more than you do well how informed are you let me ask the question apart
[01:54:56.120 --> 01:55:01.520]  from making attacks on people on forums and stuff like that what do you
[01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:07.160]  actually do to make a difference because if you really knew what was
[01:55:07.160 --> 01:55:11.800]  happening and what he's planned then your focus would be on making a
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:16.040]  difference not lambasting someone and winning brownie points and some
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:21.240]  intellectual bloody nonsensical game that they play you would see that we have
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:26.080]  to we have to focus on this and make it the focus of our lives so if you're not
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:30.840]  doing that don't tell me you understand the conspiracy because you clearly don't
[01:55:30.840 --> 01:55:37.680]  very powerful the thing is that when people are in ignorance of what's
[01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:41.560]  happening in the world and what the agenda is and where they want it to go I
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:46.840]  have some sympathy when they do nothing because they do not believe there's
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:53.760]  anything to be done when I see people who often for not their own efforts but
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:56:03.800]  the efforts of others have seen what the agenda is seen what they want to impose
[01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:10.280]  upon the world see what they're imposing now and their only response is to attack
[01:56:10.280 --> 01:56:15.480]  and undermine those that are putting their head above the trench and making
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:19.680]  a difference well I say to those people go and find your children and
[01:56:19.680 --> 01:56:25.840]  grandchildren look them in the eye and justify given what the world they're
[01:56:25.840 --> 01:56:29.960]  going to live in if we if we if they if it reaches the end that they want far
[01:56:29.960 --> 01:56:34.880]  beyond what we've got now even far far beyond and you tell you justify to them
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:39.640]  attacking and trying to undermine often exploit those who are trying to make a
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:45.800]  difference that ignorance therefore no action I can understand knowing what's
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:50.800]  at least a good part of what's happening and then seeking to undermine those who
[01:56:50.800 --> 01:56:56.440]  are trying to expose it that turns my stomach and one day one day when they
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:00.800]  wake up it will turn their own yeah it's bad luck my gut just tells me those
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:04.600]  people have no idea what they're buying into now because when you know the truth
[01:57:04.600 --> 01:57:08.440]  and decide to join evil that is the ultimate sin well I think Alex that what
[01:57:08.440 --> 01:57:12.560]  we're what's happening is is we're all learning more we're all becoming more
[01:57:12.560 --> 01:57:19.120]  aware and therefore you know you become closer and closer to to understanding
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:23.800]  what needs to be said and what needs to be done and you know we must go on
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:29.480]  doing that you know I see people over the years at various conferences and I've
[01:57:29.480 --> 01:57:33.440]  seen them make presentations and that's very nice yes that's interesting from
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:37.120]  here and I've seen them ten years later making the same presentation and I'm
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:41.240]  thinking what have you been doing the cutting edge has to constantly move and
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:45.840]  and it's moving very very fast now it's great great time to be alive it
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:49.360]  certainly is well David thank you for the time and I look forward to speaking to
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:58:08.920]  you again in the future
