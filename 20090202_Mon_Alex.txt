[00:00.000 --> 00:11.280]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.280 --> 00:18.840]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.840 --> 00:32.720]  Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen welcome we are live it is the
[00:32.720 --> 00:38.080]  second day of February 2009 we'll be here for the next four hours very
[00:38.080 --> 00:42.880]  important broadcast lined up for you today congressman Dan Hamburg will be
[00:42.880 --> 00:48.760]  joining us he's our only guest today coming up in the third hour because in
[00:48.760 --> 00:51.120]  he wrote some articles for the San Francisco Chronicle and other
[00:51.120 --> 00:56.120]  publications about the martial law program that Bush was setting up and he
[00:56.120 --> 01:00.400]  warned that it would probably be passed on the next president he of course is a
[01:00.400 --> 01:03.360]  former Democratic congressman so I want to get his take on the new
[01:03.360 --> 01:07.800]  concentration camp legislation introduced in the house to build publicly
[01:07.800 --> 01:14.320]  concentration camps around the United States and tournament camps people then
[01:14.320 --> 01:17.440]  end up emailing me going these are not death camps you know a concentration
[01:17.440 --> 01:21.640]  camp is a mass holding facility a death camp is another thing but concentration
[01:21.640 --> 01:26.440]  camps almost always turn into death camps the British invented them 250 plus
[01:26.440 --> 01:30.960]  years ago in use against the Scots and then it was exported around the world
[01:30.960 --> 01:34.600]  including the Revolutionary War in the United States and President Andrew
[01:34.600 --> 01:41.880]  Jackson's mother and brother died in a British concentration camp so that is
[01:41.880 --> 01:46.080]  coming up we'll get back into that very important issue and cover where that
[01:46.080 --> 01:52.400]  bill is right now is the co-sponsor stack up and pile up on it what a dope
[01:52.400 --> 01:57.880]  that's the headline in the news of the world attacking the gold medal eight
[01:57.880 --> 02:02.040]  time gold medal winner Michael Phelps caught with cannabis pipe and
[02:02.040 --> 02:06.440]  everybody's bashing in they're saying is gonna lose his endorsements and my
[02:06.440 --> 02:11.360]  only answer is so what I mean this is such a sick joke you can have a CIA caught
[02:11.360 --> 02:14.520]  shipping and heroin and cocaine they never get in trouble I mean the police
[02:14.520 --> 02:19.080]  actually catch the airplanes landing or they crash filled with it or constantly
[02:19.080 --> 02:21.880]  the police are caught dealing drugs but that's no big deal let's just forget
[02:21.880 --> 02:27.480]  about that but then meanwhile more than half the population admittedly has
[02:27.480 --> 02:32.400]  smoked or is smoking cannabis upwards of 90% of youth say they've tried cannabis
[02:32.400 --> 02:37.920]  I've smoked marijuana I don't like it I don't smoke it but I've smoked my fair
[02:37.920 --> 02:41.720]  share of it and does that mean I'm I'm discredited marijuana doesn't kill
[02:41.720 --> 02:47.360]  brain cells alcohol does alcohol is much worse in every study than marijuana but
[02:47.360 --> 02:51.840]  it's okay if a sports person smokes you know a pipe or smoke cigarettes which
[02:51.840 --> 02:56.240]  kill hundreds and hundreds was over 300,000 people a day and it's okay if
[02:56.240 --> 03:01.000]  they drink which kills around 400,000 a year if you count all the alcohol related
[03:01.000 --> 03:06.440]  diseases and car wrecks that's okay marijuana kills and nobody and George
[03:06.440 --> 03:11.480]  Washington smoked it yes that's in the biographies about him so again George
[03:11.480 --> 03:14.920]  Washington wasn't fit to lead this country and I guess he can't have our
[03:14.920 --> 03:20.280]  endorsement either because he smoked Mary Jane now a lot of it's serious and
[03:20.280 --> 03:24.520]  important news to get to but I'm open in the show up of this today because I'm
[03:24.520 --> 03:30.600]  sick of it 87% of illegal drug users only use marijuana they don't use
[03:30.600 --> 03:34.400]  anything else like I know a lot of pot smokers and they don't use anything and
[03:34.400 --> 03:39.240]  they don't even drink but they smoke marijuana and now obviously anything can
[03:39.240 --> 03:44.120]  be abused I know potheds who are just worthless I won't hire people who are
[03:44.120 --> 03:48.280]  potheds because you know they're they're lazy and they'll smoke it at work and if
[03:48.280 --> 03:52.320]  I catch people smoking pot or coming to work stone that they're fired but what
[03:52.320 --> 03:57.920]  somebody does in their own home is their own business and you know this guy a lot
[03:57.920 --> 04:01.600]  of athletes Schwarzenegger he's the governor of California I don't like him
[04:01.600 --> 04:05.920]  for his political stances of gun control and things like that but I mean he's on
[04:05.920 --> 04:09.760]  film and pumping iron smoking pot after he wins the championship and there's a
[04:09.760 --> 04:13.480]  lot of NFL people I've talked to who after a game will smoke it because
[04:13.480 --> 04:16.800]  they're all stressed out they're all you know mentally fired up it's a way for
[04:16.800 --> 04:21.720]  them to come down after they've been all stressed out and there's hundreds and
[04:21.720 --> 04:25.000]  hundreds of medical uses for marijuana all the major studies show it's much
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.560]  better for you than Valium or something for people that are or people who have
[04:28.560 --> 04:32.600]  glaucoma or folks who can't eat because they're on chemo on and on again but the
[04:32.600 --> 04:38.180]  main reason I'm against what's happening here is 87% of drug users only use
[04:38.180 --> 04:44.320]  marijuana you decriminalize that the drug war ends it fails it dies this
[04:44.320 --> 04:48.640]  excuse to have SWAT teams rating everybody and checkpoints and searching
[04:48.640 --> 04:53.680]  our kids at school turning America into a giant gulag so the media loves attacking
[04:53.680 --> 04:58.200]  this guy trying to tear him down so they can prop up their phony stinking drug

[08:18.560 --> 08:36.080]  from Austin Texas Alex Jones some little sneaky person took a photo of him
[08:36.080 --> 08:41.760]  in a party smoking pot this is the astonishing picture which could destroy
[08:41.760 --> 08:45.800]  the career of the greatest competitor in Olympic history in our exclusive photo
[08:45.800 --> 08:49.920]  Michael Phelps who won a record eight straight gold medals for swimming at the
[08:49.920 --> 08:56.760]  Beijing games last summer draws from a bong and they just love it they run all
[08:56.760 --> 09:01.320]  these ad council commercials when they're not recruiting new youth brigades for the
[09:01.320 --> 09:06.200]  new president Obama can equating marijuana with al Qaeda and terrorism
[09:06.200 --> 09:10.840]  because there are millions of people that have gone to prison tens of millions
[09:10.840 --> 09:15.640]  over the decades and served hard prison sentences for marijuana they need to keep
[09:15.640 --> 09:19.080]  those slaves it's just legalized slavery that's all it is and so they love
[09:19.080 --> 09:23.160]  demonizing this guy plus people love tearing down a champion they love seeing
[09:23.160 --> 09:26.600]  somebody fail or get in trouble because it makes them feel better about
[09:26.600 --> 09:30.600]  themselves in their lives instead of being better competitors or better
[09:30.600 --> 09:34.120]  business people or better humanitarians they just sit around being a critic what
[09:34.120 --> 09:38.440]  did Teddy Roosevelt say about that it is not the critic who counts not the man
[09:38.440 --> 09:42.560]  who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could
[09:42.560 --> 09:46.000]  have done them better the credit belongs to the man who was actually in the
[09:46.000 --> 09:50.840]  arena whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood who strives valiantly who
[09:50.840 --> 09:56.280]  arrows who comes short again and again because there is no effort without error
[09:56.280 --> 10:01.760]  and shortcoming but who does not but who does actually strive to do the deeds who
[10:01.760 --> 10:06.280]  knows great enthusiasm's the great devotions who spends himself in a worthy
[10:06.280 --> 10:11.720]  cause who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement and who at
[10:11.720 --> 10:16.960]  the worst if he fails at least fails while daring greatly so that his place
[10:16.960 --> 10:21.640]  shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor
[10:21.640 --> 10:26.960]  defeat absolutely and there's another facet to this story reason open the show
[10:26.960 --> 10:35.120]  of the today that is that this is the top story in the country today not that
[10:35.120 --> 10:39.400]  we're going into depression not that government corruption is at every level
[10:39.400 --> 10:43.360]  not that there are at least ten bills introduced that will effectively in the
[10:43.360 --> 10:48.400]  second amendment and ban most firearms and register and license all gun owners
[10:48.400 --> 10:53.400]  federally no discussion of that in the media because it's wildly unpopular
[10:53.400 --> 10:56.680]  close to seventy percent are against any new gun control victim disarmament
[10:56.680 --> 10:59.000]  legislation
[10:59.000 --> 11:01.800]  the more they go after our guns the bigger the gun culture grows as we
[11:01.800 --> 11:03.180]  rediscovered liberty
[11:03.180 --> 11:07.120]  for every discover the felt of liberty and armed population that final
[11:07.120 --> 11:11.440]  insurance policy against corruption and tyranny
[11:11.440 --> 11:14.800]  is it national news that they're building fema camps everywhere that's
[11:14.800 --> 11:16.600]  here and there in the papers
[11:16.600 --> 11:18.800]  the legislation's introduced a publicly
[11:18.800 --> 11:21.760]  merged them in federalize your local police under the fema camps with
[11:21.760 --> 11:23.440]  regular army on the streets
[11:23.440 --> 11:25.320]  so we should be hearing about that
[11:25.320 --> 11:26.640]  not about
[11:26.640 --> 11:28.760]  eight-time gold medal winner
[11:28.760 --> 11:30.160]  at one olympic games
[11:30.160 --> 11:31.300]  michael felps so
[11:31.300 --> 11:34.880]  undone talking about that but later in the week i think i'm gonna get uh... mark
[11:34.880 --> 11:36.840]  stepnotski
[11:36.840 --> 11:37.880]  the former uh...
[11:37.880 --> 11:40.200]  cowboys center
[11:40.200 --> 11:43.320]  who's a big uh... marijuana advocate on to talk about
[11:43.320 --> 11:46.320]  uh... this because he says he smoked it while playing
[11:46.320 --> 11:47.320]  football
[11:47.320 --> 11:48.520]  and that helped him
[11:48.520 --> 11:53.120]  uh... but uh... will certainly discuss all of that i mean you look at this
[11:53.120 --> 11:54.320]  hypocritical
[11:54.320 --> 11:56.320]  drugged out population
[11:56.320 --> 12:00.760]  over a hundred million prescriptions for serotonin re uptake inhibitors in the
[12:00.760 --> 12:05.560]  year two thousand eight alone according to associate press a million
[12:05.560 --> 12:08.840]  a hundred million i say a million prescriptions over a hundred
[12:08.840 --> 12:09.760]  million
[12:09.760 --> 12:11.160]  prescriptions
[12:11.160 --> 12:12.840]  fit uh...
[12:12.840 --> 12:15.560]  written for that here in the united states alone
[12:15.560 --> 12:18.000]  it eats holes in your brain
[12:18.000 --> 12:22.600]  highly toxic it's hallucinogenic it puts you in a dreamlike state
[12:22.600 --> 12:25.080]  it's toxic but that's okay
[12:25.080 --> 12:28.560]  and now in the last two months in the major drug makers
[12:28.560 --> 12:32.120]  of both the speed drugs like the riddle in class
[12:32.120 --> 12:34.880]  and serotonin re uptake inhibitors psychotropic
[12:34.880 --> 12:38.320]  they've come out and said this should be legalized for everybody
[12:38.320 --> 12:40.440]  and the over the counter
[12:40.440 --> 12:44.160]  we covered that a few weeks ago so they want to make stuff that eats holes in
[12:44.160 --> 12:45.200]  your brain
[12:45.200 --> 12:49.840]  and causes massive suicide psychotic breaks both the speed drugs
[12:49.840 --> 12:52.160]  and the uh...
[12:52.160 --> 12:54.360]  prosat class drugs have now had to put
[12:54.360 --> 12:58.080]  messages on their inserts admitting it can cause hallucinations
[12:58.080 --> 13:03.880]  admitting it causes psychotic breaks both these classes of drugs
[13:03.880 --> 13:06.560]  what is it forty something million are on the uh...
[13:06.560 --> 13:08.360]  speed drugs
[13:08.360 --> 13:11.280]  so they want to make that over the counter
[13:11.280 --> 13:14.480]  they wanna have the entire population on that
[13:14.480 --> 13:17.720]  but all my gosh somebody smokes weed
[13:17.720 --> 13:23.080]  the george washington smoked and man it is over we got a freak out and run

[15:11.280 --> 15:13.680]  now i'm gonna admit something i'm so busy
[15:13.680 --> 15:18.280]  that uh... a week ago week and a half ago when he signed these executive orders
[15:18.280 --> 15:21.880]  saying that uh... they were gonna abolish quanta more bay
[15:21.880 --> 15:25.240]  that all i did was read uh...
[15:25.240 --> 15:28.560]  the boil down of the executive orders at white house dot gov
[15:28.560 --> 15:32.160]  the l a times actually read all the executive orders
[15:32.160 --> 15:36.440]  and uh... then last night i did go read them myself and i look i'm not on the
[15:36.440 --> 15:37.680]  president
[15:37.680 --> 15:39.360]  i can't keep track of all this
[15:39.360 --> 15:43.160]  but i'd i noticed in the summary it said they would decide what to do in a
[15:43.160 --> 15:44.200]  year
[15:44.200 --> 15:47.120]  with one time also that left it open to leave it open
[15:47.120 --> 15:49.440]  and i noticed that's that's what the army been saying two years ago so that
[15:49.440 --> 15:52.360]  was really the bush policy continued and that they said they were gonna
[15:52.360 --> 15:54.680]  continually hold the people
[15:54.680 --> 15:56.640]  without charges indefinitely so
[15:56.640 --> 15:57.720]  the same thing
[15:57.720 --> 16:00.600]  they're just kind of rearranging deck chairs on the titanic
[16:00.600 --> 16:01.880]  or two shell game
[16:01.880 --> 16:05.600]  but in the bill it's uh... in the executive order itself it says obama
[16:05.600 --> 16:07.320]  preserves renditions
[16:07.320 --> 16:12.040]  as counterterrorism tool so the secret kidnapping of u.s. citizens farmers
[16:12.040 --> 16:14.500]  you name it grabbing people off the street
[16:14.500 --> 16:15.900]  it's all continuing
[16:15.900 --> 16:20.080]  it's all so i sat there last night for an hour and a half
[16:20.080 --> 16:22.960]  reading the executive orders were to go over those
[16:22.960 --> 16:25.200]  uh... today
[16:25.200 --> 16:27.400]  you can uh...
[16:27.400 --> 16:31.680]  go to prison planet dot com we have a link to a good well down story
[16:31.680 --> 16:34.400]  from ross story that has a link to the executive orders
[16:34.400 --> 16:36.960]  uh... in it if you want to go read the executive orders
[16:36.960 --> 16:40.920]  for yourself of the january twenty second executive order
[16:40.920 --> 16:43.920]  uh... review and disposition of individuals detained in guantanamo
[16:43.920 --> 16:45.560]  bay naval base
[16:45.560 --> 16:48.400]  enclosure of detention facilities but they're just opening new ones and
[16:48.400 --> 16:49.840]  calling them something else
[16:49.840 --> 16:52.840]  uh... review of detention policy options
[16:52.840 --> 16:56.720]  ensuring lawful interrogation so it just says we don't call it torture we call
[16:56.720 --> 16:58.120]  it harsh interrogation
[16:58.120 --> 16:59.960]  so the torture continues
[16:59.960 --> 17:05.600]  and uh... so that's the executive order you can go uh... read that for yourself
[17:05.600 --> 17:06.680]  so uh...
[17:06.680 --> 17:10.320]  there you have it obama preserves rendition two days for taking office
[17:10.320 --> 17:13.640]  and took the media
[17:13.640 --> 17:17.120]  a week and a half to figure this out myself included uh... i just read the
[17:17.120 --> 17:19.760]  summary and said folks it's the it's the same deal
[17:19.760 --> 17:24.080]  but it was worse than i was saying as usual
[17:24.080 --> 17:25.480]  so uh... will uh...
[17:25.480 --> 17:28.560]  i had arguments this weekend i am
[17:28.560 --> 17:32.520]  went out to an event to for some networking i was invited out to it and
[17:32.520 --> 17:37.760]  my way was paid so i went to uh... the ultimate fighting championship
[17:37.760 --> 17:41.320]  i figured it would be good to network with uh... folks and see how many of the
[17:41.320 --> 17:43.840]  hollywood folks i didn't know where the work we're doing and
[17:43.840 --> 17:46.480]  we ran into quite a few prominent people that are certainly where the new
[17:46.480 --> 17:47.920]  world order that was interesting all
[17:47.920 --> 17:51.720]  but i don't know all get some of what happened there
[17:51.720 --> 17:56.520]  and just the soullessness of los vegas i've been in that place in ten years
[17:56.520 --> 17:59.560]  people have asked me are you are you gambling no i don't gamble i don't
[17:59.560 --> 18:01.720]  believe in gambling online gambling
[18:01.720 --> 18:03.120]  didn't do any of that
[18:03.120 --> 18:06.680]  uh... i was there for the ultimate fighting champion hung out with the uh...
[18:06.680 --> 18:08.360]  james i hung out with uh...
[18:08.360 --> 18:12.400]  dana white the uh... founder and president he was really nice guy
[18:12.400 --> 18:16.120]  uh... i don't know that guy was a street fighter in a boxer himself
[18:16.120 --> 18:19.160]  i mean since when do you have a twenty nine-year-old owner of a massive sport
[18:19.160 --> 18:20.320]  that he
[18:20.320 --> 18:22.880]  you know took international himself
[18:22.880 --> 18:24.440]  that's just it was wild
[18:24.440 --> 18:26.680]  absolutely wild
[18:26.680 --> 18:30.640]  and i tell you the anti-new world or sentiment throughout uh... the ufc is
[18:30.640 --> 18:33.320]  just massive that's why i went to a rogan said oh yeah a bunch of fighters or

[27:39.920 --> 27:41.000]  simple
[27:41.000 --> 27:42.280]  corruption ruled
[27:42.280 --> 27:45.800]  but i mean i don't care hillary goes to bill deberg bill clinton goes to bill deberg
[27:45.800 --> 27:49.040]  uh... governor rick perry goes to bill deberg it's a felony
[27:49.040 --> 27:53.240]  under the logan act period you don't go to an international private
[27:53.240 --> 27:57.040]  uh... policy setting board where they admit their setting level policy
[27:57.040 --> 28:00.120]  while you're in office you don't go and do that
[28:00.120 --> 28:04.960]  and set policy but they don't care rick perry made an announcement
[28:04.960 --> 28:09.800]  five six years ago they were still saying bill deberg group didn't exist
[28:09.800 --> 28:12.520]  the new york times attack me saying i was crazy didn't exist
[28:12.520 --> 28:16.280]  now rick perry uh... what two years ago he goes to bill deberg and tells the
[28:16.280 --> 28:20.960]  dallas morning news before he goes
[28:20.960 --> 28:26.440]  so it's all part of just flaunting corruption in our face
[28:26.440 --> 28:30.280]  a great article uh... by patrick wood
[28:30.280 --> 28:33.720]  obama trilateral commission in game and he goes through
[28:33.720 --> 28:36.760]  how all of these people that call for world government world taxes that are
[28:36.760 --> 28:38.140]  part of the trilateral commission
[28:38.140 --> 28:41.720]  that that have written and called for north american union
[28:41.720 --> 28:44.760]  for a new international bank to control the united states which they're now
[28:44.760 --> 28:47.600]  proposing is bailout to
[28:47.600 --> 28:51.600]  and terrorizing the public if you don't support this bailout to coming up in a
[28:51.600 --> 28:52.280]  month
[28:52.280 --> 28:55.240]  in the next few weeks to a month and then they'll be a depression it'll be a
[28:55.240 --> 28:56.360]  depression
[28:56.360 --> 28:59.160]  but notice they said give us the banker bailout bill that gave them total
[28:59.160 --> 29:03.120]  immunity and secrecy unlimited funds
[29:03.120 --> 29:05.520]  trillions and trillions missing
[29:05.520 --> 29:09.440]  did it fix things no because it's by design they're just looting all the

[33:46.320 --> 33:53.280]  on it that's right we're down here in Austin Texas and the main mothership is
[33:53.280 --> 33:58.960]  up in Minneapolis Minnesota but we are growing the Info Wars Command Center and
[33:58.960 --> 34:02.640]  have some big announcements coming up in the next week we can have I'm just gonna
[34:02.640 --> 34:07.880]  leave it at that big announcements coming up big revolutionary developments

[34:13.840 --> 34:17.920]  gonna have I I might even announce it the next few days when I'm nailing down
[34:17.920 --> 34:24.200]  a few other things before we do that by the way last week we got a call from
[34:24.200 --> 34:28.280]  Professor Griff of Public Enemy and it was the day I was leaving town and he
[34:28.280 --> 34:31.560]  was unable to come on that day but when I got back this morning I'm told he
[34:31.560 --> 34:34.480]  really wants to come on sooner rather than later he may even be on the day
[34:34.480 --> 34:38.840]  work we're calling him right now and but regardless he'll be on this week very
[34:38.840 --> 34:43.480]  very excited about that the hip-hop community reaching out to us with KRS
[34:43.480 --> 34:51.360]  one last week and now Professor Griff hopefully to be on the show and they
[34:51.360 --> 34:58.920]  want to come on and talk about Barack Obama they see right through him and
[34:58.920 --> 35:03.440]  they also understand that this needs to be a non-racial issue because they
[35:03.440 --> 35:06.520]  understand how the new order is operating they hope that people won't
[35:06.520 --> 35:10.800]  criticize Obama because of political correctness not wanting to criticize a
[35:10.800 --> 35:14.680]  black guy and of course professor Griffin Keras wonder pointing out hey this
[35:14.680 --> 35:19.040]  guy's bought and paid for by the very same people well of course he is I mean
[35:19.040 --> 35:22.760]  he he said he's getting rid of Guantanamo and you read the stinking
[35:22.760 --> 35:26.880]  executive order and he says he's continuing all of it they're just gonna
[35:26.880 --> 35:32.120]  open new camps and then give it new names this is so sick and so deceptive
[35:32.120 --> 35:37.360]  look even of a Barack Obama is the most wonderful person since sliced bread in
[35:37.360 --> 35:40.640]  my new film the Obama deception we're making right now I say hey probably a
[35:40.640 --> 35:44.760]  great guy the point is he's not the president George Bush wasn't the
[35:44.760 --> 35:49.840]  president since they killed Kennedy the military industrial complex has had
[35:49.840 --> 35:54.720]  presidents as frontmen and then now he's appointing all these top new order
[35:54.720 --> 35:58.120]  people from the Bush administration the former Clinton administration it's just
[35:58.120 --> 36:02.640]  incredible by the way Jimmy Carter came out and said that 9-11 should be
[36:02.640 --> 36:07.480]  investigated as a cover-up and then we don't know exactly what the truth is
[36:07.480 --> 36:12.960]  that happened with that so that's good for Jimmy Carter that story is up on
[36:12.960 --> 36:28.520]  prisonplanet.com right now as well now in other news before I go back to well
[36:28.520 --> 36:30.960]  we haven't gone back I haven't gone to your phone calls yet before I do that I
[36:30.960 --> 36:38.880]  wanted to run through some other news reports that we have here in front of
[36:38.880 --> 36:45.120]  us like Defense Department announces civilian expeditionary for workforce
[36:45.120 --> 36:48.280]  and of course the bell I mentioned about to the feds taking over the

[37:50.200 --> 37:54.800]  good work how would I end up getting ahold of him okay I appreciate your

[38:07.200 --> 38:13.200]  com and I believe from memory his website is his name dr. Russell Blalock
[38:13.200 --> 38:20.120]  so you just Google dr. Russell Blalock and you can also just Google that name
[38:20.120 --> 38:25.080]  and the audio and video files are all over the internet so that's how you find
[38:25.080 --> 38:32.000]  it Randy in Michigan you're on the air welcome hey Alex I just wanted to say
[38:32.000 --> 38:37.920]  um yeah I call in obviously often very good chill it's always bother me on the
[38:37.920 --> 38:41.360]  Olympic topic and oh yeah by the way it's Michael Clark Duncan is the name of
[38:41.360 --> 38:46.920]  the guy I'm green mile okay I googled it I use a Google right here so um it's I
[38:46.920 --> 38:50.520]  was gonna say first easy for an ethnic group to jump on the bag and wagon that
[38:50.520 --> 38:54.440]  you know guy is a great speaker and you know that he speaks for us you know but
[38:54.440 --> 39:00.360]  it's um it's just that like what about what's gonna happen or it shows that
[39:00.360 --> 39:02.880]  you're your shows in touch with celebrities you know like we're gonna
[39:02.880 --> 39:06.880]  have professor Griff on here that's cool that he'll shine like on the other
[39:06.880 --> 39:10.440]  side you know he's these he's going to let's get clear let's get clear it was
[39:10.440 --> 39:14.160]  white people that put Barack Obama in office so I think if we say oh look
[39:14.160 --> 39:17.720]  it's easy for the black folks to get on the bandwagon the majority of the
[39:17.720 --> 39:22.600]  country who voted got on the bandwagon with Barack Obama just like after eight
[39:22.600 --> 39:25.920]  years of Bill Clinton people got on the bandwagon for George Bush thinking he
[39:25.920 --> 39:29.080]  would change it we've got to make sure in four to eight years people don't get
[39:29.080 --> 39:32.320]  on the bandwagon when it's some you know Republican white guy or some
[39:32.320 --> 39:39.040]  Republican black guy again this is all this is all just window dressing I mean
[39:39.040 --> 39:42.360]  there are plenty of real black leaders that they could have you know the people
[39:42.360 --> 39:44.840]  could have tried to run for president that would have done a great job and
[39:44.840 --> 39:48.400]  fought corruption there's plenty of great white leaders there's pretty you know
[39:48.400 --> 39:52.720]  great Asian leaders I don't care but you're right the issue is they try to
[39:52.720 --> 39:57.520]  make it all about race when it were really being diverse here and and and
[39:57.520 --> 40:02.560]  we need to move past that but it's gonna end bad it's gonna end very very sad
[40:02.560 --> 40:07.000]  because Obama is betraying his base they're not gonna want to admit to
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.120]  themselves they're being conned until things get really really bad and the
[40:10.120 --> 40:13.960]  end it's gonna get nasty and then when people start criticizing Obama the
[40:13.960 --> 40:18.840]  media is gonna try to make it a racial issue to get everybody fighting with
[40:18.840 --> 40:22.040]  each other they want divide and conquer the mainstream media the corporate
[40:22.040 --> 40:25.240]  controllers act like they want us all living in peace but really all they do
[40:25.240 --> 40:29.880]  is point out people's tiny differences to get us to fight with each other you
[40:29.880 --> 40:33.120]  know they claim it's all liberal diversity and multiculturalism but
[40:33.120 --> 40:36.600]  really all they're doing is bringing it up over and over and over again when
[40:36.600 --> 40:41.160]  most people aren't into it don't care and aren't thinking about it the media is
[40:41.160 --> 40:45.320]  always there making everything a racial issue always they're injecting it and
[40:45.320 --> 40:49.880]  that's what Barack Obama is gonna end up doing because now it's all about his
[40:49.880 --> 40:54.000]  dad being black it's all about that instead and how great it is it's our
[40:54.000 --> 40:57.960]  first black president instead of having a discussion about what are his policies
[40:57.960 --> 41:01.960]  what is he going to do you know he's talking about change and it's change
[41:01.960 --> 41:05.760]  all right it's kicking the new order agenda in high gear George Bush just
[41:05.760 --> 41:09.720]  passed the baton to him and because he doesn't come off like a complete demon
[41:09.720 --> 41:17.080]  I mean Bush just oozes evil oozes corruption oozes funkiness and and and
[41:17.080 --> 41:22.280]  bumbling stuttering whereas Obama slick well I'm sorry folks the devil slick
[41:22.280 --> 41:28.120]  like a KRS-1 said here on the air the road to hell is wide and paved and in
[41:28.120 --> 41:33.120]  smooth and looks good anything else oh yeah I had a question that would be good
[41:33.120 --> 41:36.680]  for all the viewers I was just wondering if I'm able actually to like purchase a

[42:31.760 --> 42:35.720]  is it not free why is it not free why is it not free why is it not free why is
[42:35.720 --> 42:39.760]  it not free why is it not free if you're listening on AM or FM dial it's free
[42:39.760 --> 42:42.320]  we're listening on global shortwave it's free you're listening to the archives
[42:42.320 --> 42:46.400]  it's free we're listening to the streams it's free we do four members at
[42:46.400 --> 42:51.520]  presentplanet.tv have it in you know high-quality video of my films and the
[42:51.520 --> 42:56.120]  live TV show every day because we have to charge for that I mean do you have any
[42:56.120 --> 43:00.720]  idea how much it cost to serve video out just serving free audio out a month I
[43:00.720 --> 43:06.520]  don't want to go over this again but I will just serving the 125,000 people a
[43:06.520 --> 43:09.960]  day that subscribe to the free podcast and it's kind of getting scary because it
[43:09.960 --> 43:14.440]  grows by like four or five thousand a week and we'll be doing podcasting for
[43:14.440 --> 43:18.920]  like a year and as it grows people saving it on their MP3 devices their
[43:18.920 --> 43:22.720]  iPhones everything that's costing us about five and a half six grand a month
[43:22.720 --> 43:27.880]  just to do that the streams are costing us another three or four thousand it's
[43:27.880 --> 43:33.400]  costing us a lot of money to give this out for free and then I get accused of
[43:33.400 --> 43:38.040]  it not being free when the website looks like a Christmas tree of glowing
[43:38.040 --> 43:45.720]  links to the free show but because we offer what a 64 bit for members just to
[43:45.720 --> 43:48.240]  give them a little something you know they want to listen to it on their
[43:48.240 --> 43:54.000]  surrounds down stereo oh how dare you look look that's an establishment
[43:54.000 --> 43:59.520]  intimidation tactic that we hear in the alternative media aren't supposed to
[43:59.520 --> 44:03.000]  grow that we aren't supposed to reach out and affect change that that that we
[44:03.000 --> 44:05.880]  aren't supposed to be able to sell books and videos and reach more people and be
[44:05.880 --> 44:09.360]  a movement of course we've got to find ourselves the enemy uses our tax money
[44:09.360 --> 44:13.080]  to enslave us we're a show you know we're not the IRS we don't come take your
[44:13.080 --> 44:15.840]  money or take your house or squeeze things out of you to then force
[44:15.840 --> 44:19.560]  political ideas down your throat we're here we're here on the air I'm a
[44:19.560 --> 44:24.680]  filmmaker I'm a radio talk show host and I just hope people will support us
[44:24.680 --> 44:28.520]  because we are growing exponentially and with it we're grow imagine the
[44:28.520 --> 44:31.680]  economy's imploding everything we said's coming true about the banks
[44:31.680 --> 44:36.000]  engineering the subprime crash and all of this they're now announcing world
[44:36.000 --> 44:39.000]  government and every major newspaper saying it's great and that a private
[44:39.000 --> 44:42.000]  central bank will run everything and it's the solution we told you they would
[44:42.000 --> 44:47.280]  do that a decade ago 12 13 years ago I mean that this has been the
[44:47.280 --> 44:50.880]  trilateral commission documents since the 70s but since I've been on air I've
[44:50.880 --> 44:53.800]  been covering this and now it's all coming through what do you think's
[44:53.800 --> 44:59.640]  happening to our numbers it is an explosion an explosion but it's an
[44:59.640 --> 45:09.480]  explosion of people that don't have a thin nickel and so that's why you hear
[45:09.480 --> 45:12.800]  me in here saying support us support us by the books by the videos by the
[45:12.800 --> 45:16.240]  materials because those of you that do have money because and not that it's
[45:16.240 --> 45:20.840]  just great films and books because we are literally like Atlas trying to pick

[46:52.680 --> 46:56.520]  unless I was hanging out with my friends and I watched a ton of Bloomberg CNN
[46:56.520 --> 47:02.760]  Fox there's some new CNN show I meant to write down his name he it's a black guy
[47:02.760 --> 47:06.600]  it's like a comedy show and he was saying oh Blagojevich corruptions okay
[47:06.600 --> 47:11.360]  all politics are corrupt that's just the way it is and then he went out on the
[47:11.360 --> 47:14.640]  street and was interviewing people in Chicago and they were going yeah
[47:14.640 --> 47:18.240]  corruption is just how you do things folks corruption means the government
[47:18.240 --> 47:22.320]  comes and steals your house or takes your guns corruption isn't cute or funny so
[47:22.320 --> 47:27.400]  that's how far our country's gone is they've got a new CNN show on where he's
[47:27.400 --> 47:31.080]  sitting there where the studio audience clapping and yelling when he says that
[47:31.080 --> 47:35.360]  all politicians are corrupt that's the way you get things done yeah raping the
[47:35.360 --> 47:40.280]  country that's how you get things done absolutely I tell you what and and I

[47:44.320 --> 47:48.760]  shoulders about what's the surprise what's the shock that this guy's dirty
[47:48.760 --> 47:53.800]  you know we've been conditioned to accept corruption and once you get to the
[47:53.800 --> 47:57.800]  point of being convinced to accept corruption you're buffalode you are
[47:57.800 --> 48:04.400]  you people are capitulating to corruption yeah you know we got it I I'm in an
[48:04.400 --> 48:08.560]  improv class I study improv up second city I got a former Chicago cop in my
[48:08.560 --> 48:13.680]  class he said the moment moment that Jody Weiss or whatever his scumbag name is

[49:55.960 --> 50:01.360]  freezing see they knew the earth was gonna cool they know the cycles were in
[50:01.360 --> 50:05.320]  they knew the Sun was in a 12-year Sun cycle and then as soon as it ended that
[50:05.320 --> 50:09.120]  cycle it was gonna get cold they didn't know how cold it's been now cooling down
[50:09.120 --> 50:13.600]  for a year and a half suddenly the ice caps of Mars are getting bigger suddenly
[50:13.600 --> 50:17.160]  the moons of different planets like Saturn and Jupiter and Uranus and others
[50:17.160 --> 50:25.080]  that had liquids sea moons they've frozen again they're not liquid seas of
[50:25.080 --> 50:29.760]  oxygen their methane other things the point is is that all over the solar
[50:29.760 --> 50:37.840]  system things were melting the Sun the Sun it's warm it's in the sky it's a
[50:37.840 --> 50:46.400]  standard yellow star we orbit it it gives us life it is not the carbon
[50:46.400 --> 50:52.760]  dioxide in fact I was watching a CNN I saw a waste management ad going
[50:52.760 --> 50:58.120]  waste management plants trees trees clean the air the toxic waste carbon

[55:14.360 --> 55:19.240]  out of control absolutely out of control okay let's get into the global warming
[55:19.240 --> 55:25.440]  news now that the earth is cooling because the sun is going through a
[55:25.440 --> 55:31.200]  dimming cycle they are switching the name to climate change now how
[55:31.200 --> 55:37.280]  ridiculous is that we have four seasons we have autumn we have winter we have
[55:37.280 --> 55:45.040]  spring we have summer we orbit the sun the earth is always changing and one
[55:45.040 --> 55:48.960]  volcano one volcano there's different with three different classes of
[55:48.960 --> 55:54.920]  volcanoes but the big gaseous volcanoes that explode and put a lot of dust and
[55:54.920 --> 56:00.160]  gas into the air like Mount St. Helens put out more pollution and this is
[56:00.160 --> 56:04.560]  mainstream science you can pull up the numbers then all of human activity in
[56:04.560 --> 56:11.960]  the previous hundred years before it one big volcano blowing and and 24 hours a
[56:11.960 --> 56:17.720]  day seven days a week there are scores of active volcanoes around the planet
[56:17.720 --> 56:21.720]  sometimes there's a hundred plus sometimes only 20 or 30 you know that
[56:21.720 --> 56:28.200]  are erupting or putting out ash or gas or lava flows you know pull up the
[56:28.200 --> 56:32.240]  science on those you know read what the volcanologist have to say what the
[56:32.240 --> 56:37.600]  geologist had to say and there's a lot of volcanic activity going on around the
[56:37.600 --> 56:41.880]  world right now there's a mega volcano that covers the area of three states
[56:41.880 --> 56:45.600]  surrounding Yellowstone it's right in the middle of it parts of Yellowstone
[56:45.600 --> 56:49.200]  are raising several feet a year other parts are lowering suddenly the geysers
[56:49.200 --> 56:55.960]  are going crazy suddenly old faithful is is you know going off more often and
[56:55.960 --> 57:01.320]  shooting a lot higher in the air and they're concerned the last time that
[57:01.320 --> 57:06.400]  suckers blew up volcanologist geologist seismologists say that it
[57:06.400 --> 57:10.680]  devastated large parts the United States dim the earth for years and make
[57:10.680 --> 57:17.280]  temperatures drop as much as 10 degrees one large explosive volcano can make the
[57:17.280 --> 57:23.480]  temperature of the earth go down as much as five degrees in one year
[57:24.080 --> 57:27.440]  meanwhile they want a carbon tax everything how much carbon does a
[57:27.440 --> 57:34.200]  volcano put out and I took before I get into the volcanoes I saw a piece I saw
[57:34.200 --> 57:39.760]  an ad and everything on CNN Fox you know Brita commercials for saying don't
[57:39.760 --> 57:43.160]  drink bottled water because it hurts the earth use a Brita well the problem is a
[57:43.160 --> 57:48.040]  Brita charcoal filter only cuts out some some of the bad taste it's better than
[57:48.040 --> 57:51.960]  to drink in straight tap water but the bad stuff the fluoride the mercury the
[57:51.960 --> 57:57.680]  arsenic the chlorine again you're drinking something fish can't live in
[57:57.680 --> 58:02.880]  fish die in hours you throw fish in a bucket of tap water they die well why
[58:02.880 --> 58:10.760]  are you drinking it but but side issue they are now saying that they are going
[58:10.760 --> 58:16.000]  to put taxes on basically all human activity and in this ad I saw for waste
[58:16.000 --> 58:19.960]  management they talked about how their trash companies paying for the
[58:19.960 --> 58:25.520]  environment and paying the plant trees that clean the earth of the toxic waste
[58:25.520 --> 58:29.320]  carbon dioxide folks carbon dioxide oxygen carbon dioxide water and the sun
[58:29.320 --> 58:33.720]  are the four components of the carbon cycle and life on this planet we're
[58:33.720 --> 58:37.560]  carbon-based life forms this is a tax on breathing we'll get into it when we get

[1:00:19.760 --> 1:00:27.680]  Alex Jones we are back live now into our number two on this live of February
[1:00:27.680 --> 1:00:36.680]  2nd 2009 edition more of your phone calls coming up the next segment at 1-800-259-9231
[1:00:36.680 --> 1:00:42.560]  I'm gonna get into Obama and more broken promises this time still allowing secret
[1:00:42.560 --> 1:00:46.760]  CIA and Defense Department kidnapping of American citizens and foreigners to be
[1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:50.680]  taken to torture camps it's all lies that they're getting rid of these camps
[1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:53.440]  the only thing they're doing is talking about shutting down one of hundreds they
[1:00:53.440 --> 1:00:58.720]  have Guantanamo Bay if you read the legalese in the executive order that's
[1:00:58.720 --> 1:01:02.840]  now even in the LA Times the liberal site raw stories having to admit it with
[1:01:02.840 --> 1:01:08.880]  horror yes you're being betrayed will you be as stupid as Bush supporters who
[1:01:08.880 --> 1:01:13.760]  were in the little psychological game of well Democrats are attacking Bush so
[1:01:13.760 --> 1:01:17.640]  no matter what he does we got to stick with him well Republicans are attacking
[1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:21.520]  Obama no matter what he does we got to stick with him they all work for the
[1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:28.840]  same people it's a parlor trick so that's coming up as well and we have
[1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:33.960]  congressman Hamburg joining us to get into the FEMA camp legislation next hour
[1:01:33.960 --> 1:01:38.200]  okay so we have the heaviest snow in 20 years and large parts of Britain grind
[1:01:38.200 --> 1:01:43.280]  of a halt airports are shut down roads are shut down the heaviest snowfall in
[1:01:43.280 --> 1:01:46.800]  20 years as close thousands of schools and cause transport chaos up the eastern
[1:01:46.800 --> 1:01:49.760]  side of Britain with London the surrounding areas the hardest hit six
[1:01:49.760 --> 1:01:53.120]  million bus passengers are left in the lurch as all Londoners bus service were
[1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:56.840]  halted because of dangerous driving conditions and every tube line except the
[1:01:56.840 --> 1:02:01.440]  Victoria line was at least partially suspended many mainline computer rail
[1:02:01.440 --> 1:02:05.080]  services were also cancelled or seriously delayed and flights in London
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:08.720]  airports were decimated with both of Heathrow's runways shut
[1:02:08.720 --> 1:02:14.200]  London and London City closed and Gatwick and stands at flights subject to
[1:02:14.200 --> 1:02:17.720]  delays and short notice cancellations millions of commuters stayed at home
[1:02:17.720 --> 1:02:21.560]  rather than brave the conditions as an estimated one in five people either
[1:02:21.560 --> 1:02:24.840]  worked from home or took the day off costing industry hundreds of millions
[1:02:24.840 --> 1:02:33.760]  of pounds so and the Middle East is snowing snowing in Asia tropical areas
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:38.360]  are snowing and if you go back in their histories it snows every no hundred
[1:02:38.360 --> 1:02:45.560]  years or so in these places the Middle East and areas in Asia but it does it
[1:02:45.560 --> 1:02:48.880]  every time sunspot activity is being recorded they've been studying the sun
[1:02:48.880 --> 1:02:51.880]  for hundreds of years is one of the few things has been studied scientifically
[1:02:51.880 --> 1:02:55.320]  for around 300 years closely with telescopes and they've had major
[1:02:55.320 --> 1:02:59.040]  universities marking down the number of sunspots for over 300 years they have
[1:02:59.040 --> 1:03:03.840]  never seen the sun clear with zero sunspots this long was a sunspot a
[1:03:03.840 --> 1:03:09.120]  giant sun flare blasting out from the sun it's an Indian and then the last
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:12.880]  hundred years with with instruments studying it they know that the sun is
[1:03:12.880 --> 1:03:18.480]  putting off more radiation more heat more x-rays gamma rays ultra violent
[1:03:18.480 --> 1:03:24.040]  you know the whole spectrum and it's cooled down and so now Mars is getting a
[1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:31.920]  bigger ice cap now dovetail that with volcanoes which they know a major
[1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:38.400]  gaseous explosion from a volcano puts out more than all human activity in our
[1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:45.320]  modern history is the government going to ban volcanoes because they they change
[1:03:45.320 --> 1:03:49.320]  the climate climate change we've got to stop climate change it's got to be
[1:03:49.320 --> 1:03:53.600]  forever spring time or summer we've got to stop winter I think they told the
[1:03:53.600 --> 1:03:57.520]  public winter was unnatural or summer was a naturally believe it it was cold
[1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:01.200]  now it's hot we're in crisis oh my gosh it's all over what are we gonna do it
[1:04:01.200 --> 1:04:07.280]  we're on a giant planet hurtling through galactic space stop being so stupid
[1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:13.360]  volcano erupts near Tokyo raining ash down on city oh no carbon carbon it'll
[1:04:13.360 --> 1:04:17.200]  kill everyone the volcano erupting near Tokyo early Monday spewing a plume of
[1:04:17.200 --> 1:04:20.800]  smoke more than a mile or 1.6 kilometers high and raining ash down
[1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:24.440]  apart the city there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage Mount
[1:04:24.440 --> 1:04:31.400]  Asama about 90 miles northeast of Tokyo erupted at 1.51 a.m. GMT Monday
[1:04:31.400 --> 1:04:34.560]  according to Japan's meteorological agency chunks of rock from the explosion
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:38.440]  were found three thousand three hundred feet away from the volcano the agency
[1:04:38.440 --> 1:04:42.280]  said volcanic ash fell on nearby areas as well as parts of Tokyo TV report
[1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:45.680]  showed neighborhoods sprinkled with white flakes oh my gosh we've never had
[1:04:45.680 --> 1:04:49.200]  volcanoes before banned carbon that's why their houses built out of wood and
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:53.160]  paper balsa wood because of the volcanoes because of earthquakes it's
[1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:59.640]  normal no no it's humans we get it tax me it'll fix it tax me tax me please
[1:04:59.640 --> 1:05:06.160]  take me huh the headlines are clear the worldwide economic collapse is here the
[1:05:06.160 --> 1:05:10.800]  military is being positioned for martial law the market of beast is at hand
[1:05:10.800 --> 1:05:14.840]  governments are calling for a new world cashless economic system having a long

[1:06:08.680 --> 1:06:14.320]  September 11th but who is the enemy bin Laden this is his M.O. we have to look to
[1:06:14.320 --> 1:06:18.080]  the Middle East we have to look to Osama bin Laden fabled enemies is the first

[1:06:21.680 --> 1:06:25.800]  networks inside the United States some U.S. investigators believe that there
[1:06:25.800 --> 1:06:31.600]  are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that
[1:06:31.600 --> 1:06:36.600]  some Israeli citizens have been detained in Laden's connections to the CIA the

[1:06:59.880 --> 1:07:04.080]  doctors around the world claim that cancer and other diseases cannot live
[1:07:04.080 --> 1:07:08.160]  in a pH balanced alkaline environment but as you know most people are overly
[1:07:08.160 --> 1:07:12.920]  acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise pH balance is the
[1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:16.440]  foundation of energy abundance and perfect health as well as prevention of
[1:07:16.440 --> 1:07:20.520]  disease people who alkalize the water they drink experience normalized blood
[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:24.760]  sugar mental clarity and loss of weight it was intended for human beings to
[1:07:24.760 --> 1:07:28.680]  drink alkaline water but due to modern way of life most people are overly
[1:07:28.680 --> 1:07:32.920]  acidic the fact is that disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment
[1:07:32.920 --> 1:07:36.680]  that accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and
[1:07:36.680 --> 1:07:41.160]  doesn't neutralize it do your part alkalize and supercharge your body now

[1:08:10.440 --> 1:08:15.920]  GCN radio network waging war on corruption crashing the lies and
[1:08:15.920 --> 1:08:20.880]  disinformation Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central standard
[1:08:20.880 --> 1:08:26.600]  time back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m. central standard time so volcano erupts near
[1:08:26.600 --> 1:08:31.200]  Tokyo raining ash down on the city and spewing rocks everywhere boulders
[1:08:31.200 --> 1:08:37.240]  scientists see holes in glacier at Alaska volcano AP geologists monitoring
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:42.080]  mount redoubt for signs of a possible eruption noticed a hole in the glacier
[1:08:42.080 --> 1:08:47.160]  playing to the north side of the volcano had doubled in size overnight and now
[1:08:47.160 --> 1:08:52.000]  spans the length of two football field scientists with the Alaska volcano
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:57.920]  observatory on Friday flew close to drift glacier and spotted vigorous steam
[1:08:57.920 --> 1:09:02.880]  emanating from the hole on the mountain top but Saturday they had confirmed the
[1:09:02.880 --> 1:09:10.240]  area was a firmer roll and opening in the earth that amidst gas and steam that
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:17.920]  was increasing in size and alarming rate and the same thing is happening of
[1:09:17.920 --> 1:09:23.320]  course in Yellowstone the whole thing is a firmer roll that's why you have it
[1:09:23.320 --> 1:09:28.440]  rising and falling and all the glaciers and the bubbling mud pits but it's
[1:09:28.440 --> 1:09:33.000]  getting more and more active and a lot of top volcanologists and seismologists
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:37.560]  and others that study this are saying it could blow sky high you see giant
[1:09:37.560 --> 1:09:43.760]  meteorites huge comet slam into the planet scientists had always told the
[1:09:43.760 --> 1:09:51.360]  public and to not scare them over and over and over and over again not to
[1:09:51.360 --> 1:09:55.680]  worry that it was only every 10 15 20 million years of a giant comet or
[1:09:55.680 --> 1:10:01.280]  asteroid at the planet the huge devastators but then shoemaker leavey
[1:10:01.280 --> 1:10:09.080]  the big comet slammed into one of the gas giants and broke into five pieces in
[1:10:09.080 --> 1:10:15.680]  blue holes in it as big as the earth I'm going from memory here shoemaker leavey
[1:10:15.680 --> 1:10:20.120]  slammed into it was Jupiter wasn't or was it Saturday I can't keep track of
[1:10:20.120 --> 1:10:27.840]  all this well one of you guys Google that just type a shoemaker leavey or
[1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:33.440]  comet slams into Jupiter and then the year just pull it up here for me I'm not
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:38.120]  snapping for them to snap to I snap what I'm trying to think which one did the
[1:10:38.120 --> 1:10:44.920]  comet go into I can't keep track of it all it was in those decades ago the
[1:10:44.920 --> 1:10:48.200]  point is when that happened they had to admit and then now with the observatories
[1:10:48.200 --> 1:10:56.240]  that radio telescopes every year huge asteroids come with only you know 500
[1:10:56.240 --> 1:11:00.480]  thousand miles a million miles and that sounds like far away but it's not in the
[1:11:00.480 --> 1:11:07.720]  scheme of space yes of comet slams into Jupiter March 4th 95 was when this
[1:11:07.720 --> 1:11:12.360]  article was written in July of 94 21 chunks of comet shoemaker leavey 9 which
[1:11:12.360 --> 1:11:17.200]  had broken apart a year earlier slammed into Jupiter the Hubble telescope
[1:11:17.200 --> 1:11:21.240]  recorded the spectacular event these images
[1:11:22.400 --> 1:11:26.680]  beginning at lower right chronicle the result of one such collision Hubble
[1:11:26.680 --> 1:11:31.480]  began snapping pictures of the impact just five minutes after the collision and
[1:11:31.480 --> 1:11:37.080]  you can just see the huge blast holes in the side of the gas giant as large as
[1:11:37.080 --> 1:11:43.480]  the earth okay we're talking about things hitting the planet as big as the
[1:11:43.480 --> 1:11:49.680]  planet the comet wasn't as big as the u.s. I'm going from memory on this that's
[1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:52.840]  why I pulled it up but I believe some of the chunks were like 40 50 60 miles
[1:11:52.840 --> 1:11:58.160]  across there were five major chunks this says that there were 21 total chunks
[1:11:58.160 --> 1:12:02.520]  I remember there were five giant blast holes so so the comet chunks were as big
[1:12:02.520 --> 1:12:10.360]  as the earth its blast holes the the the explosions were as big as planet earth
[1:12:10.360 --> 1:12:17.160]  now no amount of carbon taxes are gonna fix that this is climate change when a
[1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:24.680]  chunk of a comet hits your planet or in a comet hits your planet or when some
[1:12:24.680 --> 1:12:29.240]  10 mile across asteroid you know what a 10 mile across asteroid would do say it
[1:12:29.240 --> 1:12:33.000]  hitting the Gulf of Mexico again like the one of the bigger ones they're aware
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:40.080]  of it just below the Gulf of Mexico in the Caribbean it rained rocks thousands
[1:12:40.080 --> 1:12:44.720]  of miles blackened out the surface of the earth to a twilight like level for
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:50.600]  decades now how's Al Gore gonna save you from that see they're busy getting
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:54.000]  ready for all these carbon taxes and taxes on cows and sheep and poultry and
[1:12:54.000 --> 1:12:57.040]  everything you do and regulators running your life and shutting down factories
[1:12:57.040 --> 1:13:03.360]  and and banning old cars has nothing to do with it your cars are nothing we are
[1:13:03.360 --> 1:13:12.640]  nothing we are tiny we're on a tiny planet meanwhile all over the globe
[1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:20.320]  volcanoes are going crazy all over the planet volcanoes are erupting are
[1:13:20.320 --> 1:13:23.760]  getting ready to erupt there are earthquakes going off all over the
[1:13:23.760 --> 1:13:31.280]  world remember the tsunami caused by an earthquake and a volcanic explosion
[1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:35.720]  what was it 800 miles off the coast of the nearest country it hit and then a
[1:13:35.720 --> 1:13:40.640]  16-foot wave just came in and just killed everybody came in and covered
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:46.840]  whole island nations this is what humanity goes through remember Pompeii
[1:13:46.840 --> 1:13:51.080]  what it did to multiple cities killing everybody in it they dug up the
[1:13:51.080 --> 1:13:54.720]  skeletons they were covered with lava and hot ash and in seconds they were
[1:13:54.720 --> 1:14:02.000]  superheated and their skulls popped like eggs but they tell the public we've got
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:07.600]  to stop climate change the earth got one degree hotter in the last 30 years and
[1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:13.600]  cars did it when every study shows one big volcano going off more than all of
[1:14:13.600 --> 1:14:17.360]  human activity ever and I know I keep repeating that because it's so asinine
[1:14:17.360 --> 1:14:21.800]  what they claim with global warming being man-made when it has nothing to do
[1:14:21.800 --> 1:14:34.640]  with us nothing so there's a volcano becoming active starting to erupt in
[1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:41.680]  Alaska this is how stupid the mainstream media thinks the public is three
[1:14:41.680 --> 1:14:45.920]  years ago they first showed polar bears on ice floes and said the polar bears
[1:14:45.920 --> 1:14:49.240]  were gonna die because they can't swim and that they'd gotten stuck on ice
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:53.600]  floors when they've been recorded to swim up to 300 miles they like to swim
[1:14:53.600 --> 1:14:59.720]  100 miles polar bears routinely swim during the warm season they go out to
[1:14:59.720 --> 1:15:05.840]  the ice packs and they hunt beluga whale and seal and they're so strong most
[1:15:05.840 --> 1:15:08.800]  vicious land animal pound for pound and they just kill a grizzly bear in
[1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:14.400]  seconds polar bears will reach in and haul in a 2,000 pound beluga with one
[1:15:14.400 --> 1:15:19.600]  arm bam just dragged the whale up and eat it they go out and they hunt on ice
[1:15:19.600 --> 1:15:25.360]  packs their population in North America alone not counting in the other
[1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:29.920]  hemisphere because they live in the north as well in Russia and northern
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:37.680]  Europe their population went from 35,000 over 41,000 in the last decade they
[1:15:37.680 --> 1:15:40.640]  don't care they're listening in is endangered and threatened and saying
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:44.360]  they got a stop development in Alaska and Canada for the stinking things when
[1:15:44.360 --> 1:15:47.360]  they're running around stealing people's garbage running around the
[1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:52.400]  neighborhoods now that they won't allow the locals to kill them anymore so I've
[1:15:52.400 --> 1:15:57.160]  seen shows where in one little town in Canada they some days cap for as many as
[1:15:57.160 --> 1:16:01.920]  eight in these cages and then fly them hundreds of miles away and dump them out
[1:16:01.920 --> 1:16:06.920]  and they're not scared anymore so now they're starting to kill people because
[1:16:06.920 --> 1:16:11.400]  it's endangered it's threatened there's no more polar bears they can't swim they
[1:16:11.400 --> 1:16:16.040]  think you're so stupid they tell you polar bears can't swim then I see
[1:16:16.040 --> 1:16:19.280]  children's books and children's textbooks and children's TV shows where
[1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:23.760]  every time I turn television on I know I watch TV like once a week and every
[1:16:23.760 --> 1:16:26.600]  time I try to find something my children can watch on the animal planet they go
[1:16:26.600 --> 1:16:30.080]  look at the poor polar bears they're all dying because the mice is melting and
[1:16:30.080 --> 1:16:36.680]  they don't have a habitat and it's all over for them because they cute swim they
[1:16:36.680 --> 1:16:43.560]  insult your intelligence every single day hey what of these volcanoes all over
[1:16:43.560 --> 1:16:49.240]  Alaska and Canada start erupting like they're doing in northern Europe right
[1:16:49.240 --> 1:16:53.000]  now like they're doing in Iceland like they're doing in other places what's
[1:16:53.000 --> 1:16:57.920]  gonna happen if the volcano kills polar bears are we gonna ban maybe we'll have
[1:16:57.920 --> 1:17:03.520]  a tax maybe you can pay a tax it's like protection money it's like we're
[1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:08.320]  ignorant superstitious savages or something and you know the witch doctor
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:12.080]  would stand up no matter it was in ancient Europe or Asia or Africa or
[1:17:12.080 --> 1:17:15.080]  Latin America and say you give me the biggest hut you give me the biggest
[1:17:15.080 --> 1:17:19.120]  polish you give me the best food or I won't let the sun come back next week
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:23.040]  he would know that an eclipse was coming his family would pass down that
[1:17:23.040 --> 1:17:25.800]  knowledge and they'd say yes sir well do whatever you say just make the sun
[1:17:25.800 --> 1:17:31.240]  come back see how that works that's a mind trick that's a parlor trick that's
[1:17:31.240 --> 1:17:35.080]  all the superstition comes from well they do the same thing today the earth is
[1:17:35.080 --> 1:17:40.720]  gonna flood and everybody's gonna die if we don't tax people in all these
[1:17:40.720 --> 1:17:43.720]  decades they hype global warming and I told you it was all about a tax cuz
[1:17:43.720 --> 1:17:46.200]  their internal documents it was about getting you ready to accept the global
[1:17:46.200 --> 1:17:50.200]  tax paid to the global bank and now they admit it I had Rothschild on number
[1:17:50.200 --> 1:17:53.480]  year and a half ago he goes there's no tax being planned and I said yes there
[1:17:53.480 --> 1:17:58.240]  is and now they're proposing the taxes and rounding them down your throat and
[1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:02.440]  cities all over the place are passing these global greenhouse gas emission
[1:18:02.440 --> 1:18:07.640]  taxes and they're now saying they're gonna tax all barnyard animals for their
[1:18:07.640 --> 1:18:14.600]  flatulence and now they're proposing humans be taxed for our well for lack of
[1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:19.760]  a better word our farts ladies and gentlemen so I mean you know polar bears
[1:18:19.760 --> 1:18:24.120]  can swim and your flatulence didn't cause no problem and you don't have any
[1:18:24.120 --> 1:18:29.240]  real effect on this earth there are two things that man is doing that could
[1:18:29.240 --> 1:18:32.920]  destroy the earth and destroy the ecosystem we have and that's radical
[1:18:32.920 --> 1:18:37.840]  cross-PC genetic engineering nothing's being done to even regulate or control
[1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:45.560]  that and of course nuclear weapons and then in that whole physics area the fish
[1:18:45.560 --> 1:18:51.320]  infusion reactors the CERN heavy colliders that could destroy the earth
[1:18:51.320 --> 1:18:55.640]  but as the elite worried about that no they're racing to build more giant
[1:18:55.640 --> 1:18:59.360]  reactors and more fish infusion chambers and creating artificial suns and
[1:18:59.360 --> 1:19:02.240]  creating artificial black holes they've already created thousands of
[1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:06.360]  artificial black holes and laboratories and they admit well CERN could make a
[1:19:06.360 --> 1:19:09.520]  really dangerous one but it's a very low probability we believe so we're gonna
[1:19:09.520 --> 1:19:15.520]  start colliding uranium and plutonium particles at light speed slamming them
[1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:21.560]  into other blocks of uranium and plutonium and lead oh but that's not a
[1:19:21.560 --> 1:19:29.480]  problem your cows going to the bathroom is you going to the bathroom
[1:19:29.480 --> 1:19:35.080]  that's the big threat your car putting out carbon dioxide that plants breathe
[1:19:35.080 --> 1:19:41.600]  and I see TV ads saying we're planting trees to clean the the air of the toxic
[1:19:41.600 --> 1:19:48.120]  waste carbon dioxide that they breathe all right I'm gonna come back and take

[1:19:54.320 --> 1:20:00.080]  asteroids but these volcanoes they have no control over it we'll be right back

[1:25:02.920 --> 1:25:06.520]  out of my relatives in Florida that they're starting to put big posters of
[1:25:06.520 --> 1:25:10.160]  Obama all over the place and they're starting to say he'll fix everything
[1:25:10.160 --> 1:25:15.200]  yes and with government money they're running billions of dollars I mean it's
[1:25:15.200 --> 1:25:20.840]  on every TV show ad council ads government produced that say join his
[1:25:20.840 --> 1:25:26.760]  private USA service dot org and they are putting up billboards they are putting
[1:25:26.760 --> 1:25:31.760]  up posters it is confirmed the media is unified behind him which again is
[1:25:31.760 --> 1:25:35.640]  corporate owned foreign owned so they set up Bush is the bad guy now they're
[1:25:35.640 --> 1:25:41.080]  giving you the savior so that he can ram through setting up the new world order
[1:25:41.080 --> 1:25:45.000]  publicly which will be a giant offshore bank that you pay your taxes to and they've
[1:25:45.000 --> 1:25:49.840]  now announced that just the everything we said is now mainstream news in your
[1:25:49.840 --> 1:25:53.640]  face North American unions in the Wall Street Journal they say it's the only
[1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:59.280]  thing that'll save the economy also to when I had a very my father-in-law a
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:03.520]  couple weeks ago sorry to hear that couple people a couple of people from
[1:26:03.520 --> 1:26:07.360]  the military who came down because there was their grandfather and they're
[1:26:07.360 --> 1:26:10.120]  sitting there going they're talking about Obama the Obama oaths and they
[1:26:10.120 --> 1:26:12.840]  they're sitting there talking about they might be a major desertion in the
[1:26:12.840 --> 1:26:19.920]  military if they make them take this hitler oath let's be clear Bush tried
[1:26:19.920 --> 1:26:24.720]  to introduce that six years ago right after they stage 9-11 when they had
[1:26:24.720 --> 1:26:27.880]  some of the troops this was in mainstream news people are asking for
[1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:31.760]  confirmation I saw Kurt Nemo's article last night didn't do a lot of research
[1:26:31.760 --> 1:26:37.520]  on it but I remembered that it was in mainstream news about six years ago that
[1:26:37.520 --> 1:26:42.440]  Bush had a new oath but only some of the troops were given it where they swore
[1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:46.880]  an oath to the commander-in-chief now I didn't have time to do research on that
[1:26:46.880 --> 1:26:50.800]  because I can only research so much I did my research specifically on his
[1:26:50.800 --> 1:26:53.560]  executive order saying they're gonna keep kidnapping people it's known as a
[1:26:53.560 --> 1:26:59.360]  rendition but I you know just like earlier when I remembered that it was
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:03.680]  Shoemaker leaving nine that hit Jupiter and I remembered that it was five major
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:09.200]  pieces but I still didn't want to do it without checking I had the guys Google
[1:27:09.200 --> 1:27:16.640]  it and sure enough I was accurate and I was right but still it stuff 567 810
[1:27:16.640 --> 1:27:22.680]  years old I'm not a hundred percent on so for accuracy folks need to check that
[1:27:22.680 --> 1:27:25.480]  you know back when I had time I would tell my writers what I wanted to write
[1:27:25.480 --> 1:27:29.240]  about I just had Paul and Steve Watson and and I would call them and say check
[1:27:29.240 --> 1:27:31.680]  this check that you know they write a lot of stories on their own but a lot of
[1:27:31.680 --> 1:27:35.040]  stories I would say I remember this I remember that go check it and they would
[1:27:35.040 --> 1:27:38.960]  do it if I would have known that Kurt was doing that article because he I mean
[1:27:38.960 --> 1:27:42.520]  it's it's multi-dimensional but it doesn't because nobody can cover all the
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:46.520]  points it would cover the subsection I I would remember and say okay Kurt I
[1:27:46.520 --> 1:27:50.720]  remember Bush had him do an oath to like this and I remember how the oath goes
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:55.480]  it's to him not the Constitution but then they didn't it fully implement it so
[1:27:55.480 --> 1:27:59.840]  I believe this is true this has been in blogs and news and the military is
[1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:05.120]  talking about it we haven't confirmed this yet but it I do know Bush tried it
[1:28:05.120 --> 1:28:09.160]  so what did these guys in the military specifically say to you
[1:28:09.160 --> 1:28:13.840]  well also with the don't ask don't tell with the open gaze in the military and
[1:28:13.840 --> 1:28:17.120]  they said in their center talking out they might have to retake their oath
[1:28:17.120 --> 1:28:21.920]  swearing total allegiance to the camp commander in chief and they're saying if
[1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:29.800]  they have to do that they'll desert so they're saying they were told this yes

[1:30:03.280 --> 1:30:07.320]  electrical power if so this is going to be the most important message you will
[1:30:07.320 --> 1:30:11.480]  ever hear solar power generators are now available from solutions from science
[1:30:11.480 --> 1:30:16.080]  one of GCN's oldest and most trusted sponsors these emergency backup systems
[1:30:16.080 --> 1:30:19.800]  provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike gas
[1:30:19.800 --> 1:30:23.840]  generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and produces
[1:30:23.840 --> 1:30:27.520]  electricity for free it's like having an electric power plant running quietly
[1:30:27.520 --> 1:30:32.120]  in your own home run some pumps shortwave radios computers and even keep
[1:30:32.120 --> 1:30:35.720]  food from spoiling whether it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts or

[1:33:38.920 --> 1:33:45.560]  to George in Texas you had a question George yes I like to know you do you
[1:33:45.560 --> 1:33:48.320]  think we're winning because you know you look at Congress they're trying to
[1:33:48.320 --> 1:33:52.560]  ran these bills the FEMA camp bills the gun control bills to hate crime laws
[1:33:52.560 --> 1:33:56.760]  because I really think they're reacting because they're seeing them with the
[1:33:56.760 --> 1:34:00.400]  massive gun sales and they see the resistance building I think they're
[1:34:00.400 --> 1:34:03.080]  trying to you think they're trying to cut us off at the past because they know
[1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:07.880]  yes big time yes exactly they know look when the Congress had a 9% approval
[1:34:07.880 --> 1:34:13.280]  rating when the public hated both parties not just Bush the again I repeat
[1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:16.680]  this all the time but it's so important before you'd have the party that was
[1:34:16.680 --> 1:34:21.120]  in power who just replaced the last unpopular party let's say you have the
[1:34:21.120 --> 1:34:25.880]  Democrats in power and then they'd have a 55% approval rating or maybe 57% and
[1:34:25.880 --> 1:34:29.760]  the other party to have a 42 43% approval rating then people get sick after
[1:34:29.760 --> 1:34:32.920]  four eight years of that party and say well I'll put the Republicans in and
[1:34:32.920 --> 1:34:37.200]  then they'd have a 55% approval rating and the Democrats of 45 and then it
[1:34:37.200 --> 1:34:40.320]  flip-flops well that changed the last four or five years the public started
[1:34:40.320 --> 1:34:44.920]  getting wise and said you know what it doesn't matter who it is in power both
[1:34:44.920 --> 1:34:47.520]  parties are controlled but then the establishment said let's throw him a
[1:34:47.520 --> 1:34:51.400]  curveball we got a smart you know really intelligent dynamic charismatic black
[1:34:51.400 --> 1:34:56.240]  guy let's put him in there making promise change that he's gonna make it
[1:34:56.240 --> 1:34:59.040]  better and they said yeah that looks like change you know different packaging
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:03.160]  but it's the same thing inside the container and so they brought in Obama
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:07.520]  and man is he a betrayer and a liar it's worse than I even thought it would be I
[1:35:07.520 --> 1:35:10.760]  mean 10 different bills that basically outlaw almost every gun in the country
[1:35:10.760 --> 1:35:15.680]  total registration total licensing and Obama's on TV saying everything's fine
[1:35:15.680 --> 1:35:22.080]  I mean this is just amazing this is just absolutely amazing to have this going
[1:35:22.080 --> 1:35:27.560]  on and I mean I can't believe they're actually introduced bills that say
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:30.480]  every gun will be registered you won't be able to own guns if you have
[1:35:30.480 --> 1:35:34.480]  misdemeanors any psychological record you know we've got the press when you
[1:35:34.480 --> 1:35:39.080]  were a teenager or your parents had you reviewed you know anybody you have a
[1:35:39.080 --> 1:35:42.360]  car wreck now they try to give you a mental designation and say here's some
[1:35:42.360 --> 1:35:48.760]  pros that cuz your backs hurt we know you're depressed I mean it is just it's
[1:35:48.760 --> 1:35:52.760]  about institutionalizing everybody getting a label getting you on welfare
[1:35:52.760 --> 1:35:56.920]  getting you in the criminal justice system getting you in debt by hook or by
[1:35:56.920 --> 1:36:00.600]  crook they just want to get everybody in the system so they can then say well
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:03.440]  you don't have your rights because you're in the system I appreciate your call
[1:36:03.440 --> 1:36:07.520]  and then they've got FEMA camp builds and they've built the FEMA camps and it's
[1:36:07.520 --> 1:36:11.360]  in the news and mainstream news is admitting world government is here I
[1:36:11.360 --> 1:36:14.640]  mean imagine it's the world government crowd the control of the banks that
[1:36:14.640 --> 1:36:19.120]  engineered the collapse and then they're the saviors on TV I watched hours of the
[1:36:19.120 --> 1:36:26.480]  Davos Switzerland meetings on C-span in my hotel room this weekend and it was
[1:36:26.480 --> 1:36:30.360]  just they repeated the same thing this is a global crisis only a global
[1:36:30.360 --> 1:36:34.400]  solution of the new world order can fix it over and over again over it's going
[1:36:34.400 --> 1:36:37.360]  to get tough the public kind of know it's going to get tough but we'll fix it if
[1:36:37.360 --> 1:36:42.040]  they just go with the new world order over and over and over and over and
[1:36:42.040 --> 1:36:46.640]  over and over again with no one ever saying these are the guys that
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:50.440]  engineered it all and wrote white papers decades ago how they were going to get
[1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:54.240]  everybody dependent on global banks create a global system so they could
[1:36:54.240 --> 1:36:58.880]  globally take everybody down at once this is fine national this is fine
[1:36:58.880 --> 1:37:05.200]  national military conquering this is financial war this is business war this
[1:37:05.200 --> 1:37:09.760]  is corporate takeover of every government on earth they bought off the
[1:37:09.760 --> 1:37:13.720]  politicians they bought off the parties they've had those politicians then set
[1:37:13.720 --> 1:37:19.040]  up domestic police state forces this is how tyranny's done 2.0 style in the 21st
[1:37:19.040 --> 1:37:25.880]  century oh man so even though all these years we've been warning you and seeing
[1:37:25.880 --> 1:37:30.680]  their documents and covering it still takes my breath away to know that we
[1:37:30.680 --> 1:37:35.040]  have now reached the point where this thing is is is coming out from behind the
[1:37:35.040 --> 1:37:39.000]  curtain and that means they're making their final move Roy in Michigan you're
[1:37:39.000 --> 1:37:44.320]  on the air yeah Alex you know every time that they come against my neighbors
[1:37:44.320 --> 1:37:50.120]  freedom of speech or come against his right to travel without a license every
[1:37:50.120 --> 1:37:56.080]  time that they they come against any of the constitutional rights it's done
[1:37:56.080 --> 1:38:02.360]  through the courts and what needs to be done is these courts need to have a
[1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:08.960]  number of the neighborhood get together around that individual and take him to
[1:38:08.960 --> 1:38:16.440]  file a waiver of tort against the judge and enough judges get this file against
[1:38:16.440 --> 1:38:22.440]  them and they will back off well you're right that the courts are becoming so
[1:38:22.440 --> 1:38:28.920]  corrupt it's it's comical it wasn't so serious and because because communities
[1:38:28.920 --> 1:38:32.280]  don't stick together because we've been taught to watch our TV sets to not
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:36.640]  go talk to our neighbors people don't sit on their front porches anymore people
[1:38:36.640 --> 1:38:40.640]  don't go barbecue in their backyards maybe once a year for the Super Bowl we
[1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:45.400]  are just looking at the glowing mind control box and not living while the
[1:38:45.400 --> 1:38:50.360]  organized government picks us off one at a time go and they're trying to pick me
[1:38:50.360 --> 1:38:54.520]  up right now for my freedom of speech and of course I'm gonna fight this battle
[1:38:54.520 --> 1:38:57.840]  by myself but I shouldn't be fighting it by myself what are they doing to you
[1:38:57.840 --> 1:39:04.080]  what's happening well I have a billboard in my front yard which is it's a 12 foot
[1:39:04.080 --> 1:39:11.320]  high and 61 foot long and it lays out the night what what it lays out the
[1:39:11.320 --> 1:39:17.000]  wakehold that lays it all out and it has even has it for worse as one of these
[1:39:17.000 --> 1:39:21.240]  sources for getting the documentation of what I'm saying well please take a
[1:39:21.240 --> 1:39:25.680]  photo write a two paragraph blurb with your name and information if you want
[1:39:25.680 --> 1:39:31.480]  it if not leave it out and with your email address and we will post it on
[1:39:31.480 --> 1:39:37.360]  the website just send it to send it to Mike at info wars.com no Kurt at
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:43.520]  info wars.com I'll do that but the the fact is that they're taking me to court
[1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:50.800]  right now and I and I and I feel that I could win in court you have had the
[1:39:50.800 --> 1:39:55.200]  billboards up for over 12 years and let me guess they've expanded the city's
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:39:58.680]  zoning out of your area and are claiming retroactively you have no free
[1:39:58.680 --> 1:40:03.600]  speech because zoning zoning does not cover free speech statements they can
[1:40:03.600 --> 1:40:08.000]  even pass the zoning law saying no signs in your yard but if it's your free
[1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:14.880]  speech they've lost in court time and time again right but of course they
[1:40:14.880 --> 1:40:20.560]  also we have such a corrupted system up here that that I don't look to use their
[1:40:20.560 --> 1:40:27.340]  law in order to take it to defeat them there is other remedies this is what I'm
[1:40:27.340 --> 1:40:33.800]  saying is that every time that one of our neighbors gets pulled over and arrested
[1:40:33.800 --> 1:40:40.000]  for driving without a driver's license then his neighbors around him can sign
[1:40:40.000 --> 1:40:46.880]  a waiver of tort against that judge and enough people do that in the Constitution
[1:40:46.880 --> 1:40:51.960]  will become real to them in a real big hurry well you know that there's a lot
[1:40:51.960 --> 1:40:55.480]  of little things that I hear people's claim works I mean have you seen this
[1:40:55.480 --> 1:41:00.840]  waiver of tort work yes I have seen the waiver of tort they arrested one of my
[1:41:00.840 --> 1:41:08.480]  neighbors for for carrying a knife well safe for a concealed weapon and the
[1:41:08.480 --> 1:41:13.560]  judge went to the he'd put him in jail for contempt of court for filing the
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:19.280]  waiver of tort I did not a judge but the judge went to his jail cell to take it
[1:41:19.280 --> 1:41:25.120]  to to let him know that he was back it off and I know that when the judges
[1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:29.720]  become personally responsible for what they have what is going on here and
[1:41:29.720 --> 1:41:36.800]  these cops become personally responsible and have to take it to suffer a loss of
[1:41:36.800 --> 1:41:42.040]  property or whatever they will back off and what I'm telling you Roy is if you
[1:41:42.040 --> 1:41:47.320]  want support will post your email or your contact what but but send us a photo
[1:41:47.320 --> 1:41:53.280]  or a couple photos and then write what you want posted on the site okay because
[1:41:53.280 --> 1:41:57.640]  that way it's your own words and we'll post that on the site and you'll
[1:41:57.640 --> 1:42:00.200]  probably get hundreds of people in your area of Michigan that want to help you I
[1:42:00.200 --> 1:42:05.200]  appreciate your call so that was an offer of aid that's the whole point of what
[1:42:05.200 --> 1:42:09.760]  I was saying yeah especially places like Michigan and Southern California where
[1:42:09.760 --> 1:42:13.200]  the economy's imploding they're just hiring more cops and the business is
[1:42:13.200 --> 1:42:17.360]  now arresting people in nitpicking and white glove inspecting people and
[1:42:17.360 --> 1:42:22.320]  getting them in the system we're now going into the predatory cannibalism
[1:42:22.320 --> 1:42:26.480]  phase where the society completely implodes it's just gonna get worse and
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:32.440]  worse and worse and worse and worse and worse and worse because the bankers are
[1:42:32.440 --> 1:42:37.760]  running at all the criminal bankers let's talk to Steve in Chicago Steve you're
[1:42:37.760 --> 1:42:44.840]  on the air yes Alex emmerich Jones I'm gonna get your Irishness up this is a
[1:42:44.840 --> 1:42:49.000]  story about Bogorjevich that you're floating is completely wrong this is an
[1:42:49.000 --> 1:42:53.360]  all Irish gang up on the one Serbian guy that's in the government you have to
[1:42:53.360 --> 1:42:58.440]  remember the chronology of this thing Dick Durbin meets with Senator the
[1:42:58.440 --> 1:43:04.760]  attorney Patrick Fitzgerald in some kind of meeting two or three days and he
[1:43:04.760 --> 1:43:11.640]  promised him before the boy Bogorjevich is arrested he promises to give him
[1:43:11.640 --> 1:43:16.320]  tenure again now that's suddenly unusual for a Republican to get tenure from a
[1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:21.280]  Democratic senator and after that he's arrested then you have this Lisa Madigan
[1:43:21.280 --> 1:43:25.400]  jumping in first of all Durbin Durbin was one of the first calling for now
[1:43:25.400 --> 1:43:30.160]  of Bogorjevich's head the second story is this Lisa Madigan this Lisa Madigan
[1:43:30.160 --> 1:43:34.040]  tried to impeach the guy well Lisa Madigan you don't ever hear that she
[1:43:34.040 --> 1:43:38.920]  ran against the former US Deputy Attorney General with their meager
[1:43:38.920 --> 1:43:44.040]  qualifications whatever they were as a law clerk John Schmidt okay okay you're
[1:43:44.040 --> 1:43:48.240]  up in Chicago so you know all the inside baseball stuff I wasn't even
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:55.400]  commenting specifically on Bogorjevich what I was commenting on is the fact
[1:43:55.400 --> 1:44:00.160]  that regardless of whether he's guilty or not people are on the news saying oh
[1:44:00.160 --> 1:44:05.640]  all politicians are corrupt that's how you get stuff done and and you know
[1:44:05.640 --> 1:44:11.040]  acting like the corruption itself is okay as if he is guilty and as if that's
[1:44:11.040 --> 1:44:18.960]  almost like a job requirement of course they're selectively enforcing on him why
[1:44:18.960 --> 1:44:22.800]  was the FBI surveilling him to begin with we know the NSA surveils everybody
[1:44:22.800 --> 1:44:27.160]  especially politicians we know that that was one of the last things the
[1:44:27.160 --> 1:44:30.480]  Republicans did before they left office we know Obama is now going to
[1:44:30.480 --> 1:44:37.320]  persecute Republicans but and I know it was Bogorjevich who four years ago in
[1:44:37.320 --> 1:44:40.920]  the Chicago Tribune came out and said the government's running white slavery
[1:44:40.920 --> 1:44:44.840]  camps so maybe they're mad at him for doing that with Dinecore and Halliburton
[1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:49.280]  I don't know I just know that he admits he's on tapes going I want some money
[1:44:49.280 --> 1:44:54.120]  for myself from this and and and he admits he said that and I don't care if
[1:44:54.120 --> 1:44:57.240]  you know just corruption is just so widespread that that's nothing compared
[1:44:57.240 --> 1:45:03.520]  to it but the big issue here here is we have the guy to help bring him into
[1:45:03.520 --> 1:45:08.040]  politics him and Obama and you can disagree with us but this is how I
[1:45:08.040 --> 1:45:12.200]  understand it he brags about it the architect of the bailout
[1:45:12.200 --> 1:45:17.200]  Rahm Emanuel who is certainly involved with Bogorjevich and notice he's not in
[1:45:17.200 --> 1:45:22.240]  any trouble so I mean it is very confusing but something something's going
[1:45:22.240 --> 1:45:27.720]  on there go ahead okay well how about some transparency for the Fitzpatrick
[1:45:27.720 --> 1:45:33.200]  reappointment we're talking about a senator Burris being appointed a
[1:45:33.200 --> 1:45:36.640]  senator how come we don't have transparency in that in that Durban
[1:45:36.640 --> 1:45:40.320]  meeting between Fitzpatrick I want to know what's going on there another
[1:45:40.320 --> 1:45:45.440]  issue I thought this could continue in the Irish topic one German-American his
[1:45:45.440 --> 1:45:49.640]  name was Ryan had to change his name to a Bryant to be elected Cook County judge
[1:45:49.640 --> 1:45:53.320]  then we got Chicago fire department these are from the Chicago Sun-Times
[1:45:53.320 --> 1:45:57.200]  changing the scores on the paramedics test so that the Irish people can be
[1:45:57.200 --> 1:46:01.360]  paramedics that's way too much for me no I know I mean I mean look Mason's do
[1:46:01.360 --> 1:46:05.640]  this all ethnic groups or religious groups do this it's it's good old boy
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:10.040]  networks and it's certainly known that the Irish and Italian mafia run
[1:46:10.040 --> 1:46:14.400]  Chicago for a hundred years and the dailies are just open mob bosses they
[1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:20.640]  disarmed their slaves I mean I'm a I'm behind 57 so when somebody sits there I
[1:46:20.640 --> 1:46:27.120]  don't get into you know Irish German Chinese African I mean you know but so
[1:46:27.120 --> 1:46:31.040]  it doesn't bother me when somebody says there's an Irish mafia I mean we
[1:46:31.040 --> 1:46:34.680]  criticize the Irish mafia the Jewish mafia the wasp mafia that nobody ever
[1:46:34.680 --> 1:46:42.120]  talks about the biggest one I mean it's just mafia period and that's how it
[1:46:42.120 --> 1:46:47.960]  works so but we can't just accept that because then this criminality does
[1:46:47.960 --> 1:46:52.360]  completely take society over so you think we'll go a bitch is a good guy no I
[1:46:52.360 --> 1:46:56.320]  didn't say that but I'm saying you don't report that John Daly is the mayor's
[1:46:56.320 --> 1:47:00.280]  brother was in on the NAFTA treaty you don't ever report he was with Morgan
[1:47:00.280 --> 1:47:06.600]  Stanley no I never report to you listen every day for four hours well almost
[1:47:06.600 --> 1:47:11.640]  every day well that's not fair and and you know I I cover every issue that I
[1:47:11.640 --> 1:47:16.160]  come across I mean I didn't read the whole executive order a week and a half
[1:47:16.160 --> 1:47:20.240]  ago and I finally did and it says that they're gonna continue secret arrest and
[1:47:20.240 --> 1:47:22.960]  renditions I did read the part where they said they're gonna continue once
[1:47:22.960 --> 1:47:27.720]  they grab you holding you in Communicada but but you know now they say
[1:47:27.720 --> 1:47:31.040]  they're gonna keep kidnapping people and taking them to death camps a lot of them
[1:47:31.040 --> 1:47:34.160]  have died in these facilities so these are death camps the off the overseas
[1:47:34.160 --> 1:47:39.640]  ones so I'm a regular guy and I'm always bashing Mayor Daly and then his
[1:47:39.640 --> 1:47:46.600]  his his his big papa you know who's down in Hades right now and I understand
[1:47:46.600 --> 1:47:52.480]  that Chicago is his mob run but I mean what's the whole point I appreciate
[1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:56.480]  your call I mean I really don't get it I mean I can't get into every facet of
[1:47:56.480 --> 1:48:04.120]  every crook here's an example I've got an article here in my stack dealing with
[1:48:04.120 --> 1:48:10.000]  all the trilateral Commission people that are being appointed to Obama's
[1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:13.480]  administration I mean if you want me to get into the tails in their background
[1:48:13.480 --> 1:48:16.560]  okay
[1:48:16.560 --> 1:48:24.400]  Lindsay and Brian and Michael and Steve you're gonna have to hold because I'll
[1:48:24.400 --> 1:48:28.960]  just go ahead and get into some background it's a detail right now this
[1:48:28.960 --> 1:48:35.200]  is from news with views it says Obama trilateral Commission in game as
[1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:39.120]  previously noted in ponds of the global elite Barack Obama was groomed for the
[1:48:39.120 --> 1:48:43.360]  presidency by King members of the trilateral Commission most notably it
[1:48:43.360 --> 1:48:46.360]  was a big New Brzezinski co-founder of the trilateral Commission with David
[1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:52.160]  Rockefeller in 1973 it was Obama's principal foreign policy advisor they
[1:48:52.160 --> 1:48:57.400]  have links to all the background on their claims now I can speak for hours on
[1:48:57.400 --> 1:49:02.440]  each one of these people and they openly called for the North American Union
[1:49:02.440 --> 1:49:08.520]  European Union and Asian Union they've set them all up on paper American Union
[1:49:08.520 --> 1:49:13.360]  is openly operating I was watching Davos Switzerland meeting economic form they
[1:49:13.360 --> 1:49:17.240]  were admitting all this I mean but then the public isn't watching that they've
[1:49:17.240 --> 1:49:21.240]  been told it doesn't exist the pre-election attention is reminiscent
[1:49:21.240 --> 1:49:26.680]  of Brzezinski's tutoring of Jimmy Carter prior to Carter's landslide election
[1:49:26.680 --> 1:49:32.320]  76 for anyone who doubts the Commission's continuing influence on Obama
[1:49:32.320 --> 1:49:35.880]  consider that he has already appointed no less than nine members of the
[1:49:35.880 --> 1:49:39.240]  Commission to top level and key positions in his administration according
[1:49:39.240 --> 1:49:44.600]  to official trilateral Commission membership list there are only 78 87
[1:49:44.600 --> 1:49:49.640]  members from the United States the other 337 members are from other regions
[1:49:49.640 --> 1:49:53.800]  thus in less than two weeks since his inauguration Obama's appointments
[1:49:53.800 --> 1:50:00.320]  encompass more than 10% of the Commission's entire US membership is this
[1:50:00.320 --> 1:50:03.680]  a mere coincidence or is it a continuation of dominance over the
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:07.640]  executive branch since 76 well of course it is you go read the policy
[1:50:07.640 --> 1:50:10.760]  reports put out by all these characters and they're all calling for world
[1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:14.440]  currency world tax world army world regulation gun confiscation and they

[2:00:37.720 --> 2:00:42.840]  hardcore classic police state expanding now under Barack Obama and his horror at
[2:00:42.840 --> 2:00:47.200]  that I don't even pre-interviewed him but I'm sure he's a moral guy and he's
[2:00:47.200 --> 2:00:50.840]  written about this and worried about it so we'll see what is take his own Obama
[2:00:50.840 --> 2:00:54.360]  will be shocked if he doesn't know what's going on isn't concerned right now
[2:00:54.360 --> 2:00:59.800]  let us go ahead and go back to the calls Lindsey in Idaho thanks for holding
[2:00:59.800 --> 2:01:04.920]  her on the air good afternoon Alex good afternoon just have a quick question and
[2:01:04.920 --> 2:01:09.960]  a suggestion for you if I may I know you started out your show about this as I'm
[2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:13.880]  calling it this week's New World Order anti-drug poster child Michael Feltz
[2:01:13.880 --> 2:01:18.760]  yes have I pulled up have you had a chance I know you're a busy man to read
[2:01:18.760 --> 2:01:23.640]  the Fox Sports article about it and his quote to the press I've seen him
[2:01:23.640 --> 2:01:29.160]  apologizing saying I'll never do it again and he well this particular quote
[2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:32.880]  what I just wanted to read and then a quick suggestion if I may it's only a
[2:01:32.880 --> 2:01:37.640]  paragraph go ahead it says he said quote I engaged in behavior which was
[2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:42.720]  regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment Feltz said in the statement
[2:01:42.720 --> 2:01:46.240]  released and then they put in brackets and let's face it probably written by
[2:01:46.240 --> 2:01:51.560]  one of his agents and or attorneys so he goes on to say quote I'm 23 years old
[2:01:51.560 --> 2:01:56.320]  and despite the successes I've had in the pool I acted in a youthful in it and
[2:01:56.320 --> 2:02:01.400]  inappropriate way not in a manner people have come to expect from me for this I
[2:02:01.400 --> 2:02:07.760]  am sorry I promise my fans in the public it will not happen again unquote my
[2:02:07.760 --> 2:02:12.160]  suggestion is you know in this thing and you opened up your show about the
[2:02:12.160 --> 2:02:15.840]  situation with marijuana in this country when there's a whole lot bigger
[2:02:15.840 --> 2:02:21.000]  problems and I just wondered if you would consider and of course that would
[2:02:21.000 --> 2:02:25.800]  have to be probably up to his agents and or attorneys to have him on the show and
[2:02:25.800 --> 2:02:29.360]  explain your side of it are you kidding everybody wants an interview we're gonna
[2:02:29.360 --> 2:02:33.880]  try I mean we'll try I'm sure it's not gonna succeed yeah I'm not kidding I
[2:02:33.880 --> 2:02:38.360]  just I didn't know if you'd even considered it yeah well Aaron Dykes is
[2:02:38.360 --> 2:02:45.240]  right now as we speak in Kingston New York with Rob Jacobson interviewing
[2:02:45.240 --> 2:02:52.600]  Gerald Salente for the Obama film and so they're in New York's and and so Aaron
[2:02:52.600 --> 2:02:56.960]  has been filling in producing but we do have our new producer soon to be
[2:02:56.960 --> 2:03:01.240]  introduced and unveil the people in the next week or so the problem is doing
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:05.720]  interviews for producers there were so many people that were so great filming
[2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:10.440]  that position that I ended up hiring two guys for that job but I'm gonna get
[2:03:10.440 --> 2:03:13.920]  both of them to to fill in run in the TV show and board hopping as they both have
[2:03:13.920 --> 2:03:18.520]  those skills so we're gonna have two new great producers and I don't want to let
[2:03:18.520 --> 2:03:21.600]  the cat out of the bag why would you need two producers folks well there's

[2:08:00.600 --> 2:08:19.160]  he's the t-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[2:08:19.160 --> 2:08:24.840]  we are live at present-planet.tv simulcasting radio show in the television
[2:08:24.840 --> 2:08:29.040]  dimension audio and a visual thank you for joining us congressman Dan
[2:08:29.040 --> 2:08:32.240]  Hamburg is still agreed to come almost days a little bit under the weather so
[2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:34.720]  we're just gonna do about 20-30 minutes with him and then go back to your phone
[2:08:34.720 --> 2:08:38.440]  calls and cover all the news reason I wanted to have him on is that he wrote
[2:08:38.440 --> 2:08:42.840]  some big op-ed pieces in publications like the San Francisco Chronicle
[2:08:42.840 --> 2:08:48.240]  detailing PDD 51 the FEMA camps his analysis was dead on right in line with
[2:08:48.240 --> 2:08:51.960]  ours and he was worried that this whole apparatus would be passed on after Bush
[2:08:51.960 --> 2:08:56.520]  left because let's face it presidents have become ceremonial to a great
[2:08:56.520 --> 2:09:01.040]  extent whereas I would love to believe Obama really was going to fix things I
[2:09:01.040 --> 2:09:05.000]  have children whereas I would really love to believe everything was okay and
[2:09:05.000 --> 2:09:09.360]  and and get happy about a quality in our first black president I'm not here to
[2:09:09.360 --> 2:09:12.600]  be suckered or be conned and I know that he's bringing in the worst of the
[2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:17.400]  Clinton people the worst of the Bush people are staying on the banker bailout
[2:09:17.400 --> 2:09:22.040]  bill gave immunity to the bankers 8.5 trillions been stolen according to
[2:09:22.040 --> 2:09:27.880]  multiple publications Bloomberg AP San Francisco Chronicle and it's been eight
[2:09:27.880 --> 2:09:30.600]  weeks since we learned the new numbers that was in the first month and a half
[2:09:30.600 --> 2:09:36.320]  they stole over a trillion 300 mint a trillion 300 billion hard to get your
[2:09:36.320 --> 2:09:40.280]  mind around numbers that big and now they're setting up a open world bank
[2:09:40.280 --> 2:09:44.920]  run by the bankers so the ones that engineered all this Obama is run by
[2:09:44.920 --> 2:09:48.400]  Wall Street I mean I said you can't vote for McCain you can't vote for Obama
[2:09:48.400 --> 2:09:53.520]  but I agree with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts it was a big Reaganite that he said he
[2:09:53.520 --> 2:09:57.120]  was voting for Obama and I couldn't say he was bad because he said I have to
[2:09:57.120 --> 2:10:02.440]  repudiate George Bush the torture the secret arrest the police state the
[2:10:02.440 --> 2:10:06.280]  lying about wars the lying about WMD so he said I'm voting for Obama and I said
[2:10:06.280 --> 2:10:10.400]  well he's gonna be in just as bad and Robert said well probably so but it's a
[2:10:10.400 --> 2:10:13.480]  message of the world but I said well what about after Obama gets in and all
[2:10:13.480 --> 2:10:16.760]  continues he goes well that remains to be seen he was on a few weeks ago and he
[2:10:16.760 --> 2:10:20.000]  said Alex even before he was inaugurated or right after he said I think you were
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:24.080]  right looks like it's just as bad or worse because now the people are
[2:10:24.080 --> 2:10:28.200]  suckered by the slickness the intelligence I mean Bush was insulting up
[2:10:28.200 --> 2:10:32.720]  there's bumbling and stuttering and making up words Obama you know he comes
[2:10:32.720 --> 2:10:36.160]  across as genuine he's cool he wears his hat backwards and you know does the
[2:10:36.160 --> 2:10:42.920]  hang ten it'll surf and stuff he he's slick he's cool well so are a lot of
[2:10:42.920 --> 2:10:47.760]  other psychopaths silver-tongued and that's why I'm making the Obama
[2:10:47.760 --> 2:10:53.440]  deception but Congressman Hamburg I wanted to get you on to go over all of
[2:10:53.440 --> 2:10:59.320]  this and welcome to the show well thank you Alex and you know I'm a big fan of
[2:10:59.320 --> 2:11:04.760]  Paul Craig Roberts I try to read everything that that I see that comes
[2:11:04.760 --> 2:11:13.480]  out on the net that he writes and I have to say that I mostly share your
[2:11:13.480 --> 2:11:18.640]  perception I don't think Obama is a psychopath but I'd sure like to know
[2:11:18.640 --> 2:11:22.280]  what he was doing when he went to work for Business International Corporation
[2:11:22.280 --> 2:11:29.360]  after he left Columbia because there's still something about Barack Obama and
[2:11:29.360 --> 2:11:33.680]  you know I hate to be I hate to be a naysayer because so many of my friends
[2:11:33.680 --> 2:11:41.720]  and and even colleagues and people I respect are writing this Obama wave that
[2:11:41.720 --> 2:11:45.840]  you know and I don't want to be the skunk at the Garden Party but at the same
[2:11:45.840 --> 2:11:51.680]  time you know you look at so many things that are going on as you mentioned
[2:11:51.680 --> 2:11:57.840]  the retreads from Clinton the retreads from Bush the the way the economic
[2:11:57.840 --> 2:12:04.520]  crisis is being handled which seems more like a heist than a stimulus when
[2:12:04.520 --> 2:12:09.040]  you look at the continuation of the extraordinary rendition program you look
[2:12:09.040 --> 2:12:14.640]  at the continuation of the of camps that you know Guantanamo closed it in a
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:19.040]  year well you know I think they ought to close it in 24 hours I don't know why
[2:12:19.040 --> 2:12:23.280]  it takes a year you know it didn't take a year to open it it shouldn't take a
[2:12:23.280 --> 2:12:28.800]  year to close it but putting that aside Bagram Air Force base you know they're
[2:12:28.800 --> 2:12:33.400]  doing the same thing there they're doing in Guantanamo they're doing the same
[2:12:33.400 --> 2:12:41.760]  thing at US military bases in Iraq which seemed to me to still be not
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:46.800]  enduring bases they used to call them but permanent military installations as
[2:12:46.800 --> 2:12:52.880]  part of the American Empire and as a as I heard pointed out in the media last
[2:12:52.880 --> 2:13:00.640]  week Barack Obama is now in charge of the biggest military machine in the
[2:13:00.640 --> 2:13:06.080]  history of the planet by far he is now the one who has responsibility for the
[2:13:06.080 --> 2:13:14.440]  American Empire and he better start acting like he understands the undemocratic
[2:13:14.440 --> 2:13:22.720]  and and profoundly negative aspect of that and he doesn't he doesn't seem to
[2:13:22.720 --> 2:13:28.280]  really seem to have any understanding that he is now the ruler of an empire he
[2:13:28.280 --> 2:13:32.960]  is now the ruler of a country that supplies more arms around the world
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:37.840]  than than any other country on the face of the earth and in the history of the
[2:13:37.840 --> 2:13:45.600]  planet earth and you know I think I think this is going to be a pretty limp
[2:13:45.600 --> 2:13:50.800]  risted administration if what we've seen so far is an indication of what's
[2:13:50.800 --> 2:13:54.520]  what's to come you know I could go on you know we'll all cars but I want you to
[2:13:54.520 --> 2:14:00.040]  but let me throw in some points here if you look at what Barack Obama is really
[2:14:00.040 --> 2:14:04.880]  doing he's a slick pitchman but a military industrial complex owned by
[2:14:04.880 --> 2:14:08.800]  offshore banks that big isn't going to let him get in isn't going to give him
[2:14:08.800 --> 2:14:12.400]  more money than any presidential candidate was ever given four or five
[2:14:12.400 --> 2:14:16.800]  times depending which numbers you look at in Wall Street money then John
[2:14:16.800 --> 2:14:20.960]  McCain got his administration filled with the very bankers that have
[2:14:20.960 --> 2:14:25.520]  engineered this collapse and are now amassing more power terrorizing people
[2:14:25.520 --> 2:14:30.720]  saying give us unlimited power or there'll be a depression in in hindsight
[2:14:30.720 --> 2:14:34.800]  it's doing Obama a favor and that's the approach I have in the Obama deception
[2:14:34.800 --> 2:14:40.800]  of going look forget this guy look at the who's in control that's who we need
[2:14:40.800 --> 2:14:44.800]  to blame if we always get distracted and I did this I pointed out Bush was a
[2:14:44.800 --> 2:14:47.800]  distraction he was evil and horrible it should be brought to justice but still
[2:14:47.800 --> 2:14:50.800]  what about those pulling the strings what about his handlers let's look past
[2:14:50.800 --> 2:14:55.800]  Barack Obama and George Bush and look at the real power structure and it's the
[2:14:55.800 --> 2:15:00.800]  very same people now filling the ranks and so so comment on that a and then be
[2:15:00.800 --> 2:15:05.800]  on the rendition the kidnapping it says under executive orders issued by Obama
[2:15:05.800 --> 2:15:08.800]  recently the CIA still has the authority to carry out what are known as rendition
[2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:13.800]  secret abductions and transfers of prisoners to countries that cooperate
[2:15:13.800 --> 2:15:16.800]  with the United States so it's a bait and switch I mean I've been reading with
[2:15:16.800 --> 2:15:20.800]  legal scholars are saying even liberals who are kind of halfway wanting to well
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:26.800]  they're going to take them to secret camps so so so a everything's being put
[2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:29.800]  on Obama and I believe it's going to be a trap they're going to destroy him in the
[2:15:29.800 --> 2:15:34.800]  end after he's served as usefulness politically and then be still allowing
[2:15:34.800 --> 2:15:39.800]  the abductions and taking him to secret client countries well if you know it's
[2:15:39.800 --> 2:15:43.800]  you know it's way beyond creepy and you know when you hear the justification
[2:15:43.800 --> 2:15:49.800]  from it in the you know the mainstream press led by you know the New York Times
[2:15:49.800 --> 2:15:54.800]  and the Washington Post you know that the justification is well we have to keep
[2:15:54.800 --> 2:16:00.800]  these tools in our in our national tool bag for fighting terrorism well you know
[2:16:00.800 --> 2:16:05.800]  even people like Chris Matthews on MSNBC are starting to understand that you
[2:16:05.800 --> 2:16:10.800]  don't fight a war on terrorism terrorism is a tactic it has nothing to do with
[2:16:10.800 --> 2:16:16.800]  an enemy and when you try to put your finger on who the enemy is you run into
[2:16:16.800 --> 2:16:22.800]  the fact that Al Qaeda itself is a mythological organization and to the
[2:16:22.800 --> 2:16:28.800]  extent there is an Al Qaeda it was created by the CIA so I mean there are
[2:16:28.800 --> 2:16:34.800]  so many subterfuges within subterfuges within subterfuges and you're right
[2:16:34.800 --> 2:16:39.800]  the American people are are being hoodwinked they're being led around like
[2:16:39.800 --> 2:16:44.800]  sheep and for what purpose well it seems like the purpose is the same as it
[2:16:44.800 --> 2:16:50.800]  ever was which is to rob the great majority of us in order to feed the rich
[2:16:50.800 --> 2:16:55.800]  and that's that's what our economic system has been it has been about for many
[2:16:55.800 --> 2:17:00.800]  many decades if not a couple of centuries and I was meant congressman
[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:05.800]  people understand that you know I don't I don't see anything really positive
[2:17:05.800 --> 2:17:09.800]  happening for the United States of America except we're going to kind of
[2:17:09.800 --> 2:17:13.800]  while we go down the road to hell they're kind of giving us laughing gas to
[2:17:13.800 --> 2:17:17.800]  feel euphoric about Obama and he says he cares about us and he says he wants us
[2:17:17.800 --> 2:17:22.800]  to you know work with him going back to an editorial you wrote I guess about a
[2:17:22.800 --> 2:17:27.800]  year and a half ago about Bush and how the whole apparatus of the police state
[2:17:27.800 --> 2:17:32.800]  in the FEMA camps and PD 51 was all in john warren defense authorization act it
[2:17:32.800 --> 2:17:36.800]  was all aimed at us now we're seeing in the news that they're arresting people
[2:17:36.800 --> 2:17:40.800]  for marijuana they're resting people for talking back on airplanes they're charging
[2:17:40.800 --> 2:17:45.800]  them under the patriot act and it's all continuing under Obama and he's saying
[2:17:45.800 --> 2:17:48.800]  we're going to continue the war on terror we're going to encircle Russia we're
[2:17:48.800 --> 2:17:53.800]  going to 30,000 more troops to start with in Afghanistan he's talking about a
[2:17:53.800 --> 2:17:58.800]  18 to 24 I mean George Bush could have never gotten away with this but but it
[2:17:58.800 --> 2:18:02.800]  was sort of like what Bill Clinton pulled when he came into office and and was
[2:18:02.800 --> 2:18:06.800]  able to get all this legislation passed and everybody said geez the Republicans
[2:18:06.800 --> 2:18:09.800]  never could have ended welfare the Republicans never could have gotten
[2:18:09.800 --> 2:18:13.800]  napped to pass the Republicans never could have got that crime bill through
[2:18:13.800 --> 2:18:19.800]  so the Democrats you know come in and and and actualize the Republicans you
[2:18:19.800 --> 2:18:26.800]  know fondest dreams the Obama as you said is a very slick character and he
[2:18:26.800 --> 2:18:31.800]  you know it's like having will Smith as president you know people just can't
[2:18:31.800 --> 2:18:35.800]  help it love him and the wife and the babies and it's such a pretty picture
[2:18:35.800 --> 2:18:41.800]  and you know it's going to suck people along for a while but you know the
[2:18:41.800 --> 2:18:46.800]  piper will be paid and if if a year from now this economy is even more
[2:18:46.800 --> 2:18:50.800]  cratered than it is now all of a sudden you know it's going to be blaming on
[2:18:50.800 --> 2:18:57.800]  the black man and it's gonna you know I can see some very ugly scenarios down
[2:18:57.800 --> 2:19:03.800]  down the road and I think the only way you combat it is to wake up America and
[2:19:03.800 --> 2:19:09.800]  and get people to entertain the idea that they're they're being fooled
[2:19:09.800 --> 2:19:13.800]  well congressman that's finished up after the break we're about to go to
[2:19:13.800 --> 2:19:16.800]  break but but I agree with you and that's what you know when I talk to people
[2:19:16.800 --> 2:19:20.800]  like KRS one or I talked to other you know well-known hip-hop you know rap icons
[2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:23.800]  that's what they're concerned about because they're they know what's going
[2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:27.800]  on they know he's a front man and they know in the end this is a trap and that's
[2:19:27.800 --> 2:19:32.800]  why in a way I'm doing Barack Obama a favor the public needs to know this guy
[2:19:32.800 --> 2:19:35.800]  loving or hating you know you think he's the Messiah you think he's the devil
[2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:40.800]  you need to understand something he is a front man and two weeks into his
[2:19:40.800 --> 2:19:43.800]  administration we know it's business as usual we're just a little bit of pat on
[2:19:43.800 --> 2:19:47.800]  the head rhetoric so I want to get your take on that and talk about solutions
[2:19:47.800 --> 2:19:51.800]  and where you see this going and then the FEMA camp legislation openly
[2:19:51.800 --> 2:19:55.800]  introduced and they say these FEMA camps are basically going to take over local

[2:24:46.800 --> 2:24:51.800]  countries over and over again they're now doing to us it is an inside job
[2:24:51.800 --> 2:24:59.800]  congressman Emberg getting into the FEMA camps getting in to the situation
[2:24:59.800 --> 2:25:06.800]  there getting into obama's youth corps and its fourth civilian service
[2:25:06.800 --> 2:25:12.800]  rama manuals brainchild they're now announcing a civilian military the
[2:25:12.800 --> 2:25:18.800]  bill has been introduced that's in my stack of news as well break down any
[2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:23.800]  concerns you've got about that well I have to tell you Alex that I caught the
[2:25:23.800 --> 2:25:32.800]  Corbett report last week and they had quite a segment with you did you wear
[2:25:32.800 --> 2:25:37.800]  that no well the Corbett report cut you know you were the Corbett report comes
[2:25:37.800 --> 2:25:45.800]  out of Japan and they had a segment of you know of you on the air and they were
[2:25:45.800 --> 2:25:51.800]  talking about precisely this issue which is this this cult of obama and this
[2:25:51.800 --> 2:25:56.800]  this idea that we're all pledging you know not to our communities but to
[2:25:56.800 --> 2:26:05.800]  obama as the you know sort of the new the new I don't want to say fewer but
[2:26:05.800 --> 2:26:11.800]  sort of like that you know it's a cult of personality and I find it I think
[2:26:11.800 --> 2:26:15.800]  everybody should find it very alarming you know this country is not about
[2:26:15.800 --> 2:26:21.800]  individual heroes this country is about you know wasn't there something in our
[2:26:21.800 --> 2:26:25.800]  Constitution about we the people but you know we're getting away from that
[2:26:25.800 --> 2:26:32.800]  because things are at such a state that and the people are so enamored of
[2:26:32.800 --> 2:26:38.800]  brethren circuses that you know they need this symbolic presence of you know
[2:26:38.800 --> 2:26:44.800]  the great leader that we're now all going to pay homage to and I find it I
[2:26:44.800 --> 2:26:49.800]  find it disgusting but but more than that I find it very dangerous I also find
[2:26:49.800 --> 2:26:56.800]  this new HR 645 alarming at the National Emergency Centers Establishment Act
[2:26:56.800 --> 2:27:04.800]  introduced in the house of HR 645 by a man named Alfie Hastings of Florida and
[2:27:04.800 --> 2:27:09.800]  you know I served with Alfie Hastings very nice gentlemen but there's one
[2:27:09.800 --> 2:27:13.800]  interesting thing about him which was that when he was a federal judge in
[2:27:13.800 --> 2:27:23.800]  Florida he barely escaped in fact I think he did lose his judgeship on
[2:27:23.800 --> 2:27:29.800]  corruption charges and shortly thereafter was able to win a seat in the
[2:27:29.800 --> 2:27:33.800]  house but you know I was wondering well why is Alfie Hastings the one who's
[2:27:33.800 --> 2:27:39.800]  been introduced in this resolution and a colleague of mine Peter Dale Scott you
[2:27:39.800 --> 2:27:43.800]  may have heard of he's written you know extensively interviewed many times
[2:27:43.800 --> 2:27:47.800]  and everything last week anyway Peter Dale Scott's take on this is well of
[2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:51.800]  course it would be Alfie Hastings you know they've got so much crap on Alfie
[2:27:51.800 --> 2:27:55.800]  Hastings that he's you know you know they they can tell him to introduce a
[2:27:55.800 --> 2:28:00.800]  bill to you know to do anything and and he'll do it because they got plenty on
[2:28:00.800 --> 2:28:06.800]  him but if you read through this bill it's um it's very alarming it's
[2:28:06.800 --> 2:28:14.800]  establishing six FEMA camps around the United States on military bases and to
[2:28:14.800 --> 2:28:19.800]  me the best commentary I've read on this so far was the commentary made by
[2:28:19.800 --> 2:28:24.800]  Congressman Ron Paul who pointed out that the fact that they're doing this
[2:28:24.800 --> 2:28:29.800]  on military bases well let me just just read something off his blog he says
[2:28:29.800 --> 2:28:33.800]  even though we know that detention facilities are already in place they
[2:28:33.800 --> 2:28:38.800]  now want to legalize the construction of FEMA camps on military installations
[2:28:38.800 --> 2:28:43.800]  using the ever popular excuse that the facilities are for the purpose of
[2:28:43.800 --> 2:28:48.800]  national emergency national emergency centers will be used in a national
[2:28:48.800 --> 2:28:53.800]  emergency but only if the emergency requires large groups of people to be
[2:28:53.800 --> 2:29:00.800]  rounded up and detained if that isn't the case ask Paul then why have these
[2:29:00.800 --> 2:29:05.800]  national emergency facilities why are they being built in military installation
[2:29:05.800 --> 2:29:12.800]  and it's a very it's a very interesting point and it should really make
[2:29:12.800 --> 2:29:18.800]  people worried they're taking these these bases and turning them into
[2:29:18.800 --> 2:29:25.800]  places that they can move people to where they can be effectively contained
[2:29:25.800 --> 2:29:29.800]  for long periods of time if you read through the legislation congressman
[2:29:29.800 --> 2:29:32.800]  stay there stay there I don't want you to be cut off come back and start over
[2:29:32.800 --> 2:29:36.800]  on that point and I particularly have been studying similar legislation for a
[2:29:36.800 --> 2:29:40.800]  long time I want to connect a few dots when we come back with you and get your
[2:29:40.800 --> 2:29:43.800]  take on that because you were in Congress and you know what type of chance it
[2:29:43.800 --> 2:29:47.800]  has of passing we'll be right back ladies and gentlemen they've also got a
[2:29:47.800 --> 2:29:51.800]  bunch of bills to effectively ban most guns in the country introduced we're on

[2:31:00.440 --> 2:31:06.200]  May I have everybody's attention, please? I've come with a message of information.
[2:31:06.200 --> 2:31:11.000]  9-11 was an inside job. You like being a puppet, sir? You like being a puppet from the New World
[2:31:11.000 --> 2:31:15.640]  Order? How do the American people know that 9-11 was a stage? Was it engineered by you,
[2:31:15.640 --> 2:31:21.080]  David Rockefeller, the Thrallateral Commission, the CAF? Do they sit down and shout? The day that
[2:31:21.080 --> 2:31:27.560]  we stop asking questions is the day that we have allowed the seeds of despotism to grow at our own door.
[2:31:27.560 --> 2:31:32.440]  Seven years after the attacks of September 11, a global awakening has taken place.
[2:31:33.640 --> 2:31:37.480]  An inside job? How dare you?
[2:31:40.200 --> 2:31:43.800]  If you know that there's treason going on, you can be held accountable for treason yourself.
[2:31:43.800 --> 2:31:48.680]  All hell is breaking loose on Sixth Avenue. And if the government has not told the truth
[2:31:48.680 --> 2:31:52.040]  in five years, we will be here on the 10th anniversary of 9-11.

[2:31:58.120 --> 2:32:00.680]  It's now time to take the revolution to the next level.
[2:32:01.240 --> 2:32:05.640]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent? How about chlorides,
[2:32:05.640 --> 2:32:11.480]  dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehydes and more? Even fragrance can indicate the
[2:32:11.480 --> 2:32:15.560]  presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[2:32:15.560 --> 2:32:20.120]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives
[2:32:20.120 --> 2:32:24.680]  that can lead to coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the

[2:33:41.160 --> 2:33:44.680]  I don't know if we're going to win this thing, but I know this. We're in the fight. We're in the
[2:33:44.680 --> 2:33:49.880]  arena and we are not giving in. We're not giving up. We're not giving in to fear, intimidation,
[2:33:49.880 --> 2:33:58.200]  none of it. I'm going straight on. All right, former congressman is our guest, Dan Hamburg.
[2:33:59.800 --> 2:34:02.920]  And we're going to let him go here about 12 minutes or so. I'll go back to your phone calls
[2:34:02.920 --> 2:34:07.240]  and then go through a bunch of the news I haven't even gotten into yet. We were talking about,
[2:34:07.960 --> 2:34:13.640]  and you were reading a quote from Ron Paul about how serious this is.
[2:34:13.640 --> 2:34:21.000]  Excuse me. If you read the bill, the FEMA camp bill, it states they'll have clergy in
[2:34:21.000 --> 2:34:25.400]  there and local communities. And I've been studying the building of these FEMA camps.
[2:34:25.400 --> 2:34:29.320]  There's scores of them around the nation. It's been in the Houston Chronicle. So it's kind of like
[2:34:29.320 --> 2:34:35.000]  the warrantless spying. They warrantlessly spy on you and then when they get caught,
[2:34:35.000 --> 2:34:42.040]  then they try to pass bills to legalize it. And so what they've done is reverse engineering. This
[2:34:42.040 --> 2:34:46.200]  is everything I covered in my police state films, articles we've written, the clergy response teams
[2:34:46.200 --> 2:34:50.760]  we first discovered with the secret FEMA documents the pastors got to us. Nobody believed us.
[2:34:50.760 --> 2:34:54.360]  We were attacked in national news. A year and a half later, it came out in the news. It was true.
[2:34:54.920 --> 2:34:59.720]  It mentions the clergy on the camps. Now they're trained to tell their local flocks to go to the
[2:34:59.720 --> 2:35:04.040]  camps, to turn in their guns, to take force inoculations, to let them take their children away,
[2:35:04.040 --> 2:35:08.840]  to other facilities for their safety. So you see these innocuous lines in there and you know what
[2:35:08.840 --> 2:35:15.240]  it means. Also, these threat fusions, FEMA centers, they're building separate command centers in every
[2:35:15.240 --> 2:35:20.200]  city and then in even rural areas in the counties where the local police departments, they'll even
[2:35:20.200 --> 2:35:25.320]  be two or three counties of several cities, move into one building with the feds and the National
[2:35:25.320 --> 2:35:32.040]  Guard, which has now been federalized under what Homeland Security's openly announced,
[2:35:32.040 --> 2:35:36.600]  20,000 regular troops to be on the streets, the National Guard to be now be totally federal,
[2:35:36.600 --> 2:35:41.960]  governors, it says, serve at their pleasure as dual-headed officers of the U.S. military.
[2:35:42.840 --> 2:35:49.560]  And so this is a Northcom military dictatorship over the United States with clergy response teams
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:35:55.000]  and other community leaders. They're controlling the population, telling them that they can trust
[2:35:55.000 --> 2:36:00.360]  the military. Now, I mean, that's like right out of red dawn or something. That's really what happened
[2:36:00.360 --> 2:36:05.560]  in the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany and East Germany and under Mao Zedong. This is the classic
[2:36:05.560 --> 2:36:12.520]  most hardcore system. In Germany, they had clergy leaders and others tell people to go to the work
[2:36:12.520 --> 2:36:17.960]  camps for their safety. They don't announce this as a concentration camp or even a death camp.
[2:36:17.960 --> 2:36:21.720]  They go, oh, it's for your safety. Well, there's been some rioting. So with that background,
[2:36:21.720 --> 2:36:25.240]  Congressman Hamburg, can you specifically speak to what I was just talking about?
[2:36:26.920 --> 2:36:33.560]  Well, you know, again, one of the things that Ron Paul points out is that in Iceland and Greece,
[2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:41.960]  we have already had citizen riots in response to the economic meltdowns that are occurring.
[2:36:42.920 --> 2:36:50.120]  And of course, you have the last time I was on with you. It was the day or the day after Brad
[2:36:50.120 --> 2:36:55.800]  Sherman, Representative Brad Sherman, had stood up on the House floor and I think in a one-minute
[2:36:55.800 --> 2:37:03.240]  speech had talked about how he had been warned by administration officials. And this was
[2:37:03.240 --> 2:37:10.200]  later corroborated by, I think it was Senator Imhoff, that threats were actually being made
[2:37:10.200 --> 2:37:15.960]  that martial law could be instituted if the bailout bills weren't passed. So we've got that.
[2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:23.880]  We've got what you mentioned about the battle-hardened brigade now being stationed in the United
[2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:27.960]  States. There's a brigade now, I believe they're still stationed in Georgia, although they may
[2:37:27.960 --> 2:37:34.840]  have been moved to Colorado, and plans are currently being implemented to install two more
[2:37:34.840 --> 2:37:45.640]  brigades of soldiers who are trained in containing civil unrest and checkpointing transportation
[2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:51.400]  facilities and, you know, basically dealing with civilian disorder.
[2:37:52.040 --> 2:37:56.360]  Locking down cities. Let me just add the caveat to back you up. This third brigade,
[2:37:56.360 --> 2:38:01.080]  and now they've actually expanded it to four. And then suddenly they're saying maybe they're
[2:38:01.080 --> 2:38:05.320]  going to double that in a year. So it's 20,000, 40,000. They've got to be combat ready. They're
[2:38:05.320 --> 2:38:10.360]  saying the Army War College came out and said that their new mission is engaging the American
[2:38:10.360 --> 2:38:15.960]  people for civil unrest. Police agencies announced like Phoenix, we're ready to do battle with you.
[2:38:15.960 --> 2:38:22.360]  So just amazing declarations, really a war against the people. And this third brigade is the cream
[2:38:22.360 --> 2:38:27.960]  of the Army from Fallujah, from areas of Baghdad, where, as you just said,
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:32.840]  where they locked people down. So they have done the raids in homes, the gun confiscations.
[2:38:32.840 --> 2:38:39.320]  They are bringing the cream as the cadre to train the other brigades. Please comment on that.
[2:38:40.680 --> 2:38:45.720]  Well, I'm not sure what to say about it to you, but that is very frightening.
[2:38:45.720 --> 2:38:52.920]  Another thing that I want to throw in there is that at least September 14, 2001,
[2:38:53.640 --> 2:39:01.640]  a few days after the so-called 9-11 terrorist attack, the United States has been under a state of
[2:39:01.640 --> 2:39:07.880]  national emergency, which allows the federal government to put into place these continuity
[2:39:07.880 --> 2:39:15.400]  of government provisions, which allow for martial law to be instituted. Now,
[2:39:15.400 --> 2:39:23.960]  the last time that state of national emergency was reinstituted was on August 28th of 2008.
[2:39:25.160 --> 2:39:31.960]  I have heard nothing that indicates to me, and I keep looking forward and I keep asking about it,
[2:39:31.960 --> 2:39:38.840]  that that state of emergency has been rescinded by President Obama. As far as I know, this country
[2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:46.120]  is now in its, well, I guess it's still the seventh year, but getting close to the eighth year
[2:39:46.120 --> 2:39:55.880]  of a continually reinstituted on an annual basis state of national emergency.
[2:39:56.520 --> 2:40:02.040]  The Congress, when a state of national emergency is declared under United States law,
[2:40:02.040 --> 2:40:08.600]  Congress is supposed to reconsider that state of emergency on a six-month basis,
[2:40:09.160 --> 2:40:16.440]  and either rescind it or continue it. That has never occurred, and we're talking about now
[2:40:17.240 --> 2:40:24.520]  seven or eight years. So for people to believe that this country is operating in a democratic
[2:40:24.520 --> 2:40:29.640]  framework when we're under a state of emergency with continuity of government procedures and
[2:40:29.640 --> 2:40:36.040]  effect, and brigades of the Northern Command within the continental United States with Posse
[2:40:36.040 --> 2:40:42.920]  Comitatus, basically having been thrown out the window with a continuation of rendition,
[2:40:43.480 --> 2:40:52.760]  and all the rest of this stuff. I don't know what people are smoking, but they should start to
[2:40:52.760 --> 2:40:58.760]  wake up and smell the reality of what we're dealing with here.
[2:40:59.800 --> 2:41:05.880]  Congressman, I'm always impressed by how informed you are. Probably next to Ron Paul,
[2:41:05.880 --> 2:41:10.360]  you're about the only person I get on air who is always aware of every point I bring up, every
[2:41:10.360 --> 2:41:15.160]  news article I bring up, because I'm constantly trying to keep track three, four hours a day,
[2:41:15.160 --> 2:41:19.480]  and I don't find half the stuff. I find it later, and I'm always angry, because so much
[2:41:19.480 --> 2:41:23.720]  bad is happening. People think I'm putting a bad face on things. No, it's far worse
[2:41:24.680 --> 2:41:28.040]  than I always predict looking at the evidence, and then it turns out it really was.
[2:41:29.720 --> 2:41:35.880]  That said, did you see one of the former, did you see the article or one of the former Fed
[2:41:35.880 --> 2:41:41.480]  governors told Bloomberg that other Fed members he knows that are on the board of governors now
[2:41:42.360 --> 2:41:48.520]  are calling the New York Fed and the private Federal Reserve Board and saying, let us know
[2:41:48.520 --> 2:41:52.760]  what's happening with the bailout, and they tell them War Powers Act has been enacted.
[2:41:53.880 --> 2:41:59.960]  We are under martial law, and so we don't even have to tell you that. And then that dovetails
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:04.360]  with Congressman Sherman and others who've interviewed here and Senator Inoff on record
[2:42:04.360 --> 2:42:09.640]  saying that they were threatened with physical martial law on October 1st, 2nd, and 3rd if they
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:14.920]  didn't pass the bailout. So clearly with that national emergency, integrated with the John
[2:42:14.920 --> 2:42:22.600]  War Defense Authorization Act, PDD 51, enemy combatant designations, the Military Commissions
[2:42:22.600 --> 2:42:28.840]  Act, with all of this nexusing in, we are under the military dictatorship of Northcom.
[2:42:29.400 --> 2:42:35.240]  I mean, there's no other way to cut it. No, and it's a direct violation of statutes that have
[2:42:35.240 --> 2:42:43.080]  been part of this country for 200 years. But unfortunately, the great majority of our population
[2:42:43.080 --> 2:42:51.000]  is blissfully unaware. And what we need is a huge number of Paul Revere's out there,
[2:42:51.000 --> 2:42:57.800]  riding around, saying that the fascists have come and they have alighted in our cities and our
[2:42:57.800 --> 2:43:07.400]  towns, and they are robbing this country of whatever hope of liberty that we ever hope to
[2:43:07.400 --> 2:43:14.520]  exercise as citizens. And I just hope there's more programs like yours out there and that
[2:43:15.720 --> 2:43:20.040]  people will start to wake up because as one of our great patriots said,
[2:43:20.040 --> 2:43:28.120]  eternal vigilance is the price of liberty. And without an informed public, democracy is dead.
[2:43:28.920 --> 2:43:32.120]  Well, I agree with you. And Congressman, in the last few minutes we have with you,
[2:43:32.120 --> 2:43:39.960]  let's put the cherry on top here. We're under the War Powers Act. We're under Northcom.
[2:43:40.680 --> 2:43:46.520]  Well, previously they would have a SENTCOM. They would have a SouthCOM. They would have
[2:43:47.240 --> 2:43:52.680]  areas that were under the military control in the empire. And now we have Northcom over the
[2:43:52.680 --> 2:43:56.520]  heart of the empire, the homeland. I mean, look at all these terms. Look at the nomenclature.
[2:43:56.520 --> 2:44:01.000]  This is a long, strategic program. We know these FEMA camps didn't just pop up this week
[2:44:01.000 --> 2:44:05.160]  as they're saying, oh, for the economic emergency, they've been slowly preparing
[2:44:05.160 --> 2:44:09.480]  for this for decades with the shadow government, the parallel government, the national security
[2:44:09.480 --> 2:44:14.440]  government, the national security dictatorship that Peter Del Scott talked so much about.
[2:44:14.440 --> 2:44:19.640]  He isn't Obama, the cherry on top, the messianic leader. We're in a crisis. This unpopular president
[2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:24.920]  has left. He comes in. He's slick. He loves us. He cares, but he needs dictatorial power.
[2:44:24.920 --> 2:44:30.120]  They're putting up billboards. They're running government PSAs about him like he's God saying,
[2:44:30.120 --> 2:44:37.880]  join his USA service.org. It's a private group under him like Mao. I mean, I couldn't dream up a
[2:44:37.880 --> 2:44:44.680]  worse scenario. I couldn't dream up something more horrible. I mean, it looks like he's the guy,
[2:44:44.680 --> 2:44:48.840]  the fresh horse they're putting into the race that is going to drag us right into the worldwide
[2:44:48.840 --> 2:44:57.720]  dictatorship. Well, who could do it better? You know, it would have to be somebody who
[2:44:57.720 --> 2:45:09.880]  met the qualifications the way that Barack Obama does. And again, I think anyone with a critical
[2:45:09.880 --> 2:45:17.080]  mind has to ask themselves, where did this man come from? You know, as wonderful as he appears
[2:45:17.080 --> 2:45:22.760]  and intelligent and all the rest, you don't go from the Illinois State Senate to the president
[2:45:22.760 --> 2:45:28.760]  of the United States unless you've got some very extraordinary backing. And there was somewhere
[2:45:28.760 --> 2:45:33.560]  along the line in the Barack Obama story. And again, I go back to this business international
[2:45:33.560 --> 2:45:38.200]  corporation, which is where Obama went after Columbia, which, you know, you can look it up
[2:45:38.200 --> 2:45:42.920]  in Wikipedia and they'll tell you it's the CIA front. There was some point at which Obama
[2:45:42.920 --> 2:45:50.040]  was recruited and trained to be a certain type of political figure. And I'm not saying that
[2:45:50.040 --> 2:45:54.840]  when they trained him, you know, back, you know, when he had just finished undergraduate school
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:46:00.280]  before he went to Harvard, that they knew that he would be this person. I think the CIA recruits
[2:46:00.280 --> 2:46:07.000]  and trains scores, if not hundreds of young people for these types of jobs, and they don't
[2:46:07.000 --> 2:46:12.840]  know exactly who is the one that's going to emerge. But I think they've got a pool of candidates.
[2:46:12.840 --> 2:46:18.280]  You know, Bill Clinton was recruited by the British CIA section chief, who now,
[2:46:18.280 --> 2:46:23.800]  from our own research, ran the Kennedy assassination. And that's now declassified.
[2:46:23.800 --> 2:46:27.800]  So we know Clinton and Hillary were both CIA. It's funny you bring that up.
[2:46:30.120 --> 2:46:35.480]  I didn't know this till about a week ago. Did you know that Obama's first job after
[2:46:35.480 --> 2:46:40.840]  college was with Henry Kissinger at Kissinger and Associates? That's above CIA. I mean,
[2:46:40.840 --> 2:46:46.040]  this is the guy who's kind of the gopher for the ultra elite over every major president
[2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:51.000]  since Richard Nixon. I mean, can you specifically, I mean, is that a good thing on Obama's resume
[2:46:51.000 --> 2:46:56.600]  that the uber gopher of the globalist was his handler out of college?
[2:46:57.800 --> 2:47:03.800]  Well, no, but it, you know, it tells you a lot about who Barack Obama is. And, you know, we saw
[2:47:03.800 --> 2:47:09.880]  the confirmation of that when Obama became president and we watched him, our president-elect,
[2:47:09.880 --> 2:47:15.400]  and we watched him pick the people who would surround him in his cabinet. And, you know,
[2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:20.360]  a lot of people said, well, you know, he's just got the old LBJ strategy of, you know,
[2:47:20.360 --> 2:47:25.720]  it's better to have all inside the tent than outside the tent. But, you know, there's just
[2:47:25.720 --> 2:47:33.320]  too many globalists, too many corporative, too many imperialists in that cabinet to make you
[2:47:33.320 --> 2:47:39.080]  believe. I mean, you just, you just have to be a Pollyanna to believe that this is going to end well.
[2:47:39.880 --> 2:47:42.440]  Congressman, give out your website for folks that want to visit.
[2:47:42.440 --> 2:47:46.840]  It's voiceoftheenvironment.org.
[2:47:47.640 --> 2:47:51.640]  Voiceoftheenvironment.org. We'll put that up on the television screen for folks.
[2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:58.120]  Voiceoftheenvironment.org. In closing, you're still pushing to bring Bush to justice. I mean,
[2:47:58.120 --> 2:48:03.640]  that's one of the big things with Obama. He's not saying a peep. In fact, in his speech after
[2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:08.200]  he was sworn in, he turned to Bush and thanked him for the great job he'd done, which I thought was
[2:48:08.200 --> 2:48:13.160]  thoroughly disgusting after he talked about how evil Bush was and ran on Bush's crimes, only to flip
[2:48:13.160 --> 2:48:17.800]  flop and wallow in all of them. And it seems to accelerate them. So your final comments on
[2:48:17.800 --> 2:48:24.280]  bringing Bush to justice and how that segues into, isn't that another big test of Obama?
[2:48:24.280 --> 2:48:28.600]  Will he do anything to anybody in the Bush administration or will he protect them?
[2:48:30.200 --> 2:48:36.440]  Well, you know, the question I have is how much political capital will Obama expend
[2:48:36.440 --> 2:48:43.880]  to stop an investigation and a prosecution? I mean, we're already seeing the beginnings of that
[2:48:43.880 --> 2:48:49.480]  with this whole issue around Carl Rove and Harriet Meyers. And we found out that Fred Fielding,
[2:48:49.480 --> 2:48:54.200]  you know, and I think it was on January 16th, just before the end of the Bush administration,
[2:48:55.320 --> 2:49:01.400]  wrote letters to Carl Rove's attorney and Harriet Meyers' attorney informing them that
[2:49:01.400 --> 2:49:11.080]  that they had full immunity, in perpetuity for any, you know, any prosecution for actions they had
[2:49:11.080 --> 2:49:21.240]  taken. So it looked as if Bush and his people are operating on this whole new theory, which has
[2:49:21.240 --> 2:49:27.640]  never really been tested in American history, that a president can continue. You know, it's almost
[2:49:27.640 --> 2:49:34.920]  like, you know, exerting power from beyond the grave. I mean, here is a, here is someone who
[2:49:34.920 --> 2:49:40.760]  has no constitutional authority anymore, basically telling the government that you cannot touch
[2:49:40.760 --> 2:49:48.200]  people who served, who served in my administration. So your words, is Obama already protecting Bush?
[2:49:48.840 --> 2:49:52.520]  Excuse me? Is, clearly it looks like Obama is going to protect Bush.
[2:49:52.520 --> 2:49:59.320]  Uh, I don't know. I don't know. All I'm saying is that I don't think Obama will
[2:49:59.320 --> 2:50:05.720]  expend a lot of political capital to fight, you know, say if Congress comes up with a commission,
[2:50:05.720 --> 2:50:11.160]  which is what this guy, Steve Cohn, who's a congressman from, from Memphis, Tennessee,
[2:50:11.160 --> 2:50:15.640]  is talking about, you know, they're going to file, they're going to file a bill and they're
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:20.520]  going to try to set up a commission whose purpose is to investigate and perhaps prosecute the crimes
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:27.080]  of the Bush administration. We'll see how far that goes. Absolutely. I think it's worth,
[2:50:27.080 --> 2:50:32.120]  I think it's worth looking at Steve Cohn though. I saw him on TV last week and I've got to say
[2:50:32.120 --> 2:50:37.320]  the guy's a straight shooter and I don't think John Conyers, you know, it's going to come through
[2:50:37.320 --> 2:50:42.280]  the Judiciary Committee and I don't see John Conyers stopping it. All right, we're going to get
[2:50:42.920 --> 2:50:47.960]  Congressman Cohn on the show then if he'll do it. Congressman Dan Hamburg, thank you so much for
[2:50:47.960 --> 2:50:52.840]  all your time and get better from that cold. We'll talk to you as soon as this unfolds. My pleasure.

[2:52:04.440 --> 2:52:09.960]  a terrorist act of war against this country. The enemy struck America on September 11th.
[2:52:09.960 --> 2:52:15.640]  But who is the enemy? bin Laden. This is his MO. We have to look to the Middle East. We have to
[2:52:15.640 --> 2:52:21.000]  look to Osama bin Laden. Fabled Enemies is the first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist
[2:52:21.000 --> 2:52:26.200]  ties to intelligence networks inside the United States. Some US investigators believe that there
[2:52:26.200 --> 2:52:33.080]  are Israelis again very much engaged in spying in and on the US. I'm aware that some Israeli
[2:52:33.080 --> 2:52:38.760]  citizens have been detained. Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers' ties to the FBI,
[2:52:38.760 --> 2:52:43.000]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,

[2:54:04.280 --> 2:54:08.440]  All right, let's go right back into this segment quick here because I want to go to your phone
[2:54:08.440 --> 2:54:13.000]  calls here for the balance of this hour and the whole next hour. I'm going to take a ton of your
[2:54:13.000 --> 2:54:20.600]  calls at 800-259-9231 and we're also going to cover some news I haven't detailed yet
[2:54:20.600 --> 2:54:26.600]  on several very, very serious issues. All right, first up I want to tell you about
[2:54:26.600 --> 2:54:34.680]  preparedness. We believe in preparedness here and one great place to check out is mysolarbackup.com.
[2:54:34.680 --> 2:54:38.600]  They have a great unit, an emergency power backup kit which consists of the power,
[2:54:38.600 --> 2:54:43.240]  source 1800 power plant and a high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless
[2:54:43.240 --> 2:54:47.000]  electricity. That's right, it generates free electricity. Remember too that gas generators
[2:54:47.000 --> 2:54:51.320]  need gas but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run electricity. The
[2:54:51.320 --> 2:54:56.120]  solar generator is like having a silent power plant hidden in your home. Take them up in Kentucky
[2:54:56.120 --> 2:55:01.000]  and other states totally locked down. It's sunny days out there but everything's covered with snow.
[2:55:01.000 --> 2:55:04.360]  They had a couple of these units that could run your whole house but with one you could heat at
[2:55:04.360 --> 2:55:08.840]  least one room and that could save you. See, I mean it's just important to have this type of
[2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:12.440]  stuff in these crazy times because once things completely break down, if they do, you won't
[2:55:12.440 --> 2:55:18.200]  be able to get these systems or it'll be very hard. 877-327-0365 is the toll free number,
[2:55:18.200 --> 2:55:26.520]  mysolarbackup.com, 877-327-0365, a great unit. Also on the subject of preparedness,
[2:55:26.520 --> 2:55:33.240]  you could hook your little solar power system up to the acola blue and it runs off solar or
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:37.720]  right out of the wall. Produces seven and a half gallons a day, about three and a half gallons,
[2:55:37.720 --> 2:55:41.800]  even in the driest climates. It's like 2% humidity here in this office and it's still
[2:55:41.800 --> 2:55:46.280]  producing about a gallon and a half a day. We got one here in the office. I mean there's
[2:55:46.280 --> 2:55:50.760]  almost nothing in here but it's getting enough for us to all drink out of it. The other office
[2:55:50.760 --> 2:55:53.800]  it would fill up every day like seven gallons. This one's so much bigger and drive for some
[2:55:53.800 --> 2:56:04.840]  reason. But side issue, here's the number, acola blue 800-691-6043, 800-691-6043 or the website
[2:56:04.840 --> 2:56:12.360]  acola blue, E-C-O-L-O blue.com, big fat banners up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com and then it
[2:56:12.360 --> 2:56:17.720]  goes through seven internal filters after it grabs the air and then gets the water out of it.
[2:56:17.720 --> 2:56:22.680]  Just an amazing little system. Looks like a water cooler without the water bottle on the top,
[2:56:22.680 --> 2:56:33.240]  800-691-6043, 800-691-6043 or acola blue.com. Okay, let's get in one call right now before
[2:56:33.240 --> 2:56:37.240]  the shower ends and I'm going to go to everybody after that. Steve in California, you're on the
[2:56:37.240 --> 2:56:43.640]  year. Welcome. God bless you, Alex. You're doing the Lord's work. Thank you. Hey, I just have two
[2:56:43.640 --> 2:56:49.160]  points of interest to make, if I can. Sure. First one is, you know, here in California we're
[2:56:49.160 --> 2:56:56.520]  suffering a budget crisis and I just wish that, you know, more Californians would wake up and
[2:56:56.520 --> 2:57:02.120]  find out about the comprehensive annual finance reports that they have, that they did, they forced
[2:57:02.120 --> 2:57:07.880]  them to take their money out of their offshore bank accounts and balance the budget and not force
[2:57:07.880 --> 2:57:12.280]  us to pay any more taxes. That's right. For those that don't know, the Pentagon that took over the
[2:57:12.280 --> 2:57:18.920]  U.S. in 47, now publicly taken over, the receiver armed with the foreign banks, they took the Chicago
[2:57:18.920 --> 2:57:25.720]  mobs model they'd had for decades called Chicago 1313, where they took on average about 65 percent.
[2:57:25.720 --> 2:57:31.160]  Now it's up to almost 80. It's like 67 percent on average nationally and they take city, county,
[2:57:31.160 --> 2:57:36.120]  water district, school district money. It's put into a double set of books, not for pension
[2:57:36.120 --> 2:57:40.920]  investments, but separately and then all they were talking about is the budget. Instead of talking
[2:57:40.920 --> 2:57:46.840]  about the real set of books in every county, city, state, every federal agency has one and the bankers
[2:57:46.840 --> 2:57:50.840]  use that money to then buy up infrastructure, but now so they have to pay the counties and
[2:57:50.840 --> 2:57:55.080]  cities the money back, they're bankrupting the shell corporations. These big banks, these big
[2:57:55.080 --> 2:57:59.880]  brokerage firms, they were the fronts telling the cities and counties invest here, we'll pay off
[2:57:59.880 --> 2:58:04.920]  your politicians later. It's totally criminal, but it's totally legal and no one will talk about it,
[2:58:04.920 --> 2:58:10.280]  but I made a film about it, but all the documents are public. Just Google comprehensive annual
[2:58:10.280 --> 2:58:16.840]  financial report and you can read it. And then they have to blow out all the big corporations,
[2:58:16.840 --> 2:58:20.440]  people see those falling, they think they're elitrally in trouble. Just like Enron, they've
[2:58:20.440 --> 2:58:25.800]  already moved all the real assets and cash out the back door. It's the globalist. They're money
[2:58:25.800 --> 2:58:29.880]  laundering, drug dealing, bankers who literally own the printing presses that issue the money
[2:58:29.880 --> 2:58:34.040]  and you write your IRS check to them, it's to the Federal Reserve. Was that your point? Do you have
[2:58:34.040 --> 2:58:43.960]  one more? I got one more. One more straight ahead. We come back fourth hour. Thank you for listening

[2:59:59.160 --> 3:00:22.040]  See how this works is the global engineers, they're in control because they're smart.
[3:00:23.080 --> 3:00:26.040]  They're just totally ruthless and criminal. We're about to naive sheep.
[3:00:26.040 --> 3:00:31.640]  What they do is they have unfunded mandates, federal laws on the states and the counties and
[3:00:31.640 --> 3:00:36.920]  the cities with regulations and control that ups the huge budgets of the states.
[3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:41.080]  Then they get the states, the counties, the cities, every other governmental and quasi-governmental
[3:00:41.080 --> 3:00:46.760]  district to invest in offshore investments and the lie was then they'll just take the
[3:00:46.760 --> 3:00:51.400]  profit from those and put them in budget but they never do. Then the cities in the last few
[3:00:51.400 --> 3:00:56.120]  years started in Orange County and then with the state investment fund about five years ago
[3:00:56.120 --> 3:01:00.200]  they said we want your money and they said you can't have it and that's really one of the things
[3:01:00.200 --> 3:01:04.600]  that started things imploding but that was by design and now they're going to get the money out
[3:01:04.600 --> 3:01:08.520]  and it's gone. Now that they're way over budget they want some of the comprehensive annual financial
[3:01:08.520 --> 3:01:14.680]  report mafia books and they're saying it isn't there for you. You don't get it because the
[3:01:14.680 --> 3:01:18.840]  market's gone down. These companies are insolvent. The banks and brokerage firms and investment
[3:01:18.840 --> 3:01:22.520]  houses won't say how much money they've got. Government won't make them show it. They're the
[3:01:22.520 --> 3:01:26.520]  ones talking about more regulation to fix it but they're the banks that are above regulation.
[3:01:27.320 --> 3:01:31.800]  They don't follow the same rules. They don't pay taxes. They do whatever they want.
[3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:36.840]  You can read news articles every day about top companies paying no taxes or 1% taxes
[3:01:36.840 --> 3:01:41.800]  and no one enforces. Made off for decades they knew it was a Ponzi scheme but he started the
[3:01:41.800 --> 3:01:48.440]  stock exchange, NASDAQ. So these guys don't play by the rules folks. No one's looking at them.
[3:01:48.440 --> 3:01:53.720]  No one. This is their big heist and the police state you see is to stop you from rightfully going
[3:01:53.720 --> 3:01:57.560]  and taking your government over through elections or physically and bringing them to justice. The
[3:01:57.560 --> 3:02:02.040]  only thing that can stop them is the people and Northcom is here to stop the people. Northcom's
[3:02:02.040 --> 3:02:06.760]  here to destroy America and bring down the Republic and I can bring Ron Paul on. I can bring
[3:02:06.760 --> 3:02:11.000]  Congressman Hamburg on. I can bring Senator Inhofe on here. I can bring them all on to tell you
[3:02:11.000 --> 3:02:16.440]  we're under Northcom martial law and those top generals getting multi-million dollar
[3:02:16.440 --> 3:02:20.360]  golden parachutes when they retire and in defense contractors. You have all the low-level troops
[3:02:20.360 --> 3:02:24.680]  that think they're patriotic. It's a corporate takeover. You don't work for us anymore. I'm
[3:02:24.680 --> 3:02:29.560]  not your enemy but let's not play games about who you're working for. Going back to Stephen
[3:02:29.560 --> 3:02:33.880]  California one more question and I'm going everybody else. Yeah it was a point of interest
[3:02:33.880 --> 3:02:40.200]  I wanted to make. I don't know if you know this but here in Southern California we have the
[3:02:40.200 --> 3:02:46.840]  Magna Carta on display at the Ronald Reagan Library and it kind of alarmed me when I found
[3:02:46.840 --> 3:02:53.000]  that out last month. You know if the new world order wanted to stage an attack
[3:02:54.360 --> 3:02:57.720]  you know for pretext for many other actions. I believe there's three copies of the Magna
[3:02:57.720 --> 3:03:03.400]  Carta like there were 10 copies of the Declaration of Independence. Right but for symbolism for
[3:03:03.400 --> 3:03:10.200]  symbolism you know state if they wanted to stage an attack you know they they could get rid of the
[3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:16.600]  document destroy it and you know have well some kind of yeah for those that don't well I mean for
[3:03:16.600 --> 3:03:20.120]  those that don't know the Magna Carta is what the Bill of Rights and Constitution comes out of
[3:03:20.120 --> 3:03:26.360]  from 1215 and running me and the first thing Blair did when he got in office in 97 96 was to say
[3:03:26.360 --> 3:03:30.680]  I am getting rid of the Magna Carta and the public was so dumbed down you know
[3:03:30.680 --> 3:03:35.640]  liquored up in England. I mean they admit most alcoholic state in the world just as decadent
[3:03:35.640 --> 3:03:40.120]  as the Americans they're like screw it get rid of it. Now the police are on the street going
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:44.440]  terrorism if you photograph us you're not allowed to videotape as beaten somebody we're in charge
[3:03:44.440 --> 3:03:48.600]  as a terrorist. Now they're busy stealing people's property. They have cameras in all the school's
[3:03:48.600 --> 3:03:52.280]  bathrooms as the children use the bathroom that was in the news today and the school said what's
[3:03:52.280 --> 3:03:56.600]  the big deal. So we videotape our children and now schools are in the U.S. putting cameras in
[3:03:56.600 --> 3:04:03.160]  bathrooms everywhere. That's 1984. Very interesting point about the Magna Carta. Very very interesting.
[3:04:03.160 --> 3:04:08.520]  Oh something else go ahead. I just want to say you're my prayers and keep fighting New World War.
[3:04:09.080 --> 3:04:14.440]  I appreciate it. Yeah it's only your prayers that keep us going here.
[3:04:16.040 --> 3:04:20.040]  Now that's why I dedicate so much time to this not because I'm even some wonderful good you know
[3:04:20.040 --> 3:04:27.080]  good guy I mean I am a good guy overall but I'm worldly as well. I am here doing this because I
[3:04:27.080 --> 3:04:34.360]  know that no matter what the risk to myself the cost of doing nothing's too high to my family and
[3:04:34.360 --> 3:04:38.520]  my fellow humanity because I know what happens to others will happen to myself or my children
[3:04:38.520 --> 3:04:46.040]  or their their great grandchildren and I just love humanity. I just like good guys creative people.
[3:04:46.040 --> 3:04:51.160]  I love honorable people. I hate scum. I hate traders. I hate bullies and let me tell you
[3:04:51.160 --> 3:04:56.520]  filthy disgusting criminal bullies are in control of our society and they got a giant spin machine
[3:04:56.520 --> 3:04:59.000]  trying to cover for them but it's not going to work if you stop them.

[3:06:13.480 --> 3:06:17.800]  We have to look to the Middle East. We have to look to Osama Bin Laden. Fabled enemies is the
[3:06:17.800 --> 3:06:22.680]  first 9-11 film to take a close look at the terrorist ties to intelligence networks inside
[3:06:22.680 --> 3:06:27.960]  the United States. Some U.S. investigators believe that there are Israelis again very much engaged
[3:06:27.960 --> 3:06:34.520]  in spying in and on the U.S. I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:06:34.520 --> 3:06:39.720]  Bin Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI, the Saudi Arabian connection,
[3:06:39.720 --> 3:06:44.280]  the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games, the shadow government and much much

[3:07:04.120 --> 3:07:07.960]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the
[3:07:07.960 --> 3:07:13.800]  world. Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver
[3:07:13.800 --> 3:07:18.360]  who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein,
[3:07:18.360 --> 3:07:23.560]  nitrates or saline solutions. Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles,
[3:07:23.560 --> 3:07:28.520]  it can be better utilized at the cellular level, and germs can't mutate to be resistant like
[3:07:28.520 --> 3:07:33.640]  they can to modern-day antibiotics. Utopia Silver has a broad range of health supplements,
[3:07:33.640 --> 3:07:37.880]  including colloidal silver, gold and copper, with a money-bag guarantee on the colloidal
[3:07:37.880 --> 3:07:42.360]  products we produce. For four years, Utopia Silver has been fighting in the Texas courts
[3:07:42.360 --> 3:07:47.240]  against agencies that would steal our God-given rights of healthcare and freedom of speech.

[3:08:17.240 --> 3:08:25.480]  Going back to your calls, Steve had one more point he wanted to make. Go ahead and make it.
[3:08:29.480 --> 3:08:33.400]  Oh, he dropped off. Okay, Michael, in North Carolina, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[3:08:34.600 --> 3:08:41.640]  Hello, Alex. I've got three short questions for you. The first question has to do with the economy.
[3:08:41.640 --> 3:08:49.720]  Real quickly, I'm a would-be federal government employee, a public planner,
[3:08:50.840 --> 3:08:55.240]  and I'm pretty seriously concerned with how community governments are being directed.
[3:08:56.920 --> 3:09:02.840]  For instance, it's hard for me to believe that particularly people in government are so stupid
[3:09:02.840 --> 3:09:08.760]  that they can't predict the fall of the value of the dollar in the face of a lot of common-sense
[3:09:08.760 --> 3:09:16.520]  analysis and prediction. Sir, sir, hold on. They set the policies that did it. So, of course,
[3:09:16.520 --> 3:09:24.360]  they know it was going to happen, yes. That's what I'm seeing. And yet I'm seeing a lot of
[3:09:24.360 --> 3:09:29.960]  people who deny that. Well, none of that's your opinion. They've written hundreds of white papers.
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:37.560]  The Federal Reserve's admitted they were doing this. Yeah. So, if there's an intentional
[3:09:37.560 --> 3:09:43.960]  aspect to this and you and I probably agree that there is, why would the various banks that
[3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:48.920]  own the Federal Reserve deflate the value of the dollar? That's my first question.
[3:09:49.800 --> 3:09:54.840]  Okay. You know what? Just give me all your questions and I'll let you go and try to answer
[3:09:54.840 --> 3:09:58.520]  and because it could take, I want to try to move quickly today, but this is very important.
[3:09:58.520 --> 3:10:09.560]  Why deflate? Okay. What's the next one? Fair enough. An analog to Irving Fisher's
[3:10:10.120 --> 3:10:16.680]  stamp scrap would be, I think, an antidote to any fractional reserve banking system's
[3:10:17.240 --> 3:10:22.840]  constriction of credit. So, the second question has to do with how such a system would be
[3:10:22.840 --> 3:10:29.800]  implemented, how you think such a system would be implemented. And the third question
[3:10:31.480 --> 3:10:35.560]  has to do with the people who are responsible for what we're in.
[3:10:37.560 --> 3:10:41.640]  When considering the history of Bolshevism and the Communist Manifesto,
[3:10:42.440 --> 3:10:49.080]  when considering the protocols of the elders of Zion, when considering Harold Rosenthal's
[3:10:49.080 --> 3:10:55.400]  interview and many other documents, what do you think the relationship between Zionism and the
[3:10:55.400 --> 3:11:02.360]  world and the New World Order is? Do you think Zionism is a genuine racist movement?
[3:11:03.880 --> 3:11:07.960]  And really, that's about all I have. Okay. That's three huge questions.
[3:11:10.440 --> 3:11:15.560]  Why would the private Federal Reserve that controls the United States and gets to milk it
[3:11:15.560 --> 3:11:19.720]  and where American taxpayers pay their money, the private Federal Reserve, why would they kill
[3:11:19.720 --> 3:11:24.040]  the goose that laid the golden eggs? Because they're internationalists, because the Federal
[3:11:24.040 --> 3:11:28.360]  Reserve has stock held in it by international groups and private families. That's on record.
[3:11:29.080 --> 3:11:34.040]  And so, they must sacrifice the United States on the altar of globalism to bring in the new
[3:11:34.040 --> 3:11:37.960]  system. One of the Wall Street Journal last week with that headline about the New World
[3:11:37.960 --> 3:11:42.520]  Orders here, North American Union, they said, oh, this is the answer to fix the crisis.
[3:11:42.520 --> 3:11:46.440]  You're not going to have a good economy. You're not going to have a job and food on the table
[3:11:46.440 --> 3:11:51.400]  and clothes for your children and a car to drive to work and no vacations, no life basically,
[3:11:51.400 --> 3:11:57.800]  depression, unless you do what we say. And that is all these different private central banks owned
[3:11:57.800 --> 3:12:04.440]  by the same families are now merging into one global bank that will set taxes, regulations,
[3:12:04.440 --> 3:12:10.040]  carbon taxes, micromanaging every part of your life. So they've answered it for you.
[3:12:10.040 --> 3:12:13.560]  They said decades ago in the Tri-Lateral Commission documents in the 70s that we've covered in
[3:12:13.560 --> 3:12:19.160]  nauseam that they would implode the economy around 2005 or a few years behind and merge the
[3:12:19.160 --> 3:12:23.320]  American Union, the Asian Union, the European Union together. Those agreements are already
[3:12:23.320 --> 3:12:27.880]  all been signed. We're already in an American Union, already merging with the European Union.
[3:12:27.880 --> 3:12:32.680]  As of two years ago, I have Bush on the White House lawn saying it with the leader of the European
[3:12:32.680 --> 3:12:38.200]  Union and Merkel, the head of Germany. And we have the judicial watch documents through four
[3:12:38.200 --> 3:12:42.680]  warriors. We're in it. And the public is just now being told by the Wall Street Journal and the
[3:12:42.680 --> 3:12:48.120]  New York Times that, oh, yeah, it is an North American Union. That'll fix the crisis. So see,
[3:12:48.120 --> 3:12:51.960]  they always get us four or five steps ahead and then tell us about a step, five, six steps behind.
[3:12:53.000 --> 3:12:56.440]  That's how they do this. You know, they build the camps, then they introduce legislation.
[3:12:56.440 --> 3:13:00.280]  Oh, we're going to legalize camps and have the local police under it and the local clergy.
[3:13:02.520 --> 3:13:06.200]  I said I was going to blitz their phone calls. These questions are so important.
[3:13:06.200 --> 3:13:12.680]  It's hard to not answer them all. Then you talked about what type of money system should we have
[3:13:12.680 --> 3:13:16.760]  if we remove the fractional reserve banking fraud of the international bankers, which they're not
[3:13:16.760 --> 3:13:19.960]  even doing fractional reserve banking now. They just do whatever they want. And that answers your
[3:13:19.960 --> 3:13:25.880]  first question. They've created unlimited capital, thousands of trillions over the last few decades
[3:13:25.880 --> 3:13:30.280]  in European and U.S. money. They have bought up real assets with it, knowing it would let
[3:13:30.280 --> 3:13:36.840]  it evaluate the money. They've held that off and now that phase is coming. So that's what's
[3:13:36.840 --> 3:13:40.600]  happening there. What type of system should we have if we had a good government, if the people
[3:13:40.600 --> 3:13:45.400]  were involved and educated about fractional reserve banking and educated about paper script,
[3:13:45.400 --> 3:13:49.320]  it really does grease the skids of the economy. It's just going to be used and abused and will
[3:13:49.320 --> 3:13:54.840]  always be abused. And so it's a very dangerous system. Set currencies of silver or gold or
[3:13:54.840 --> 3:13:59.160]  tally sticks or seashells or wampum, glass beads, whatever people have used throughout history,
[3:13:59.160 --> 3:14:09.720]  salt, sugar, spices, frankincense and myrrh, that can all be misused and cornered. People always
[3:14:09.720 --> 3:14:13.880]  go in and history when that happens and buy up the key distribution of that, the key production
[3:14:13.880 --> 3:14:20.920]  of those things, and then they manipulate that. So that's a problem as well. But it's better
[3:14:20.920 --> 3:14:26.200]  than a fiat system run by the elites. Could we have a fiat system run by the government? I tend
[3:14:26.200 --> 3:14:30.520]  to lean towards that and disagree with Ron Paul and the Austrian School of Economics about their
[3:14:30.520 --> 3:14:34.840]  goldback system because we're so deep into this that we'd have to extricate ourselves. And then
[3:14:34.840 --> 3:14:39.320]  Ron Paul has said it would take some time. So I think a hybrid of the two systems, I think competing
[3:14:39.320 --> 3:14:43.480]  monetary systems are the answer. So perhaps we can have a script system, a private script system,
[3:14:43.480 --> 3:14:51.480]  a group of script systems, and then a government system. And then at the same time have a barter
[3:14:51.480 --> 3:14:56.040]  system with gold and silver that would be done also off of script. Then you're back to the gold
[3:14:56.040 --> 3:15:00.440]  smiths who would only have so much gold in their vault and issuing too much script and then buying
[3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:07.560]  off politicians with their undue capital that's really fiat. And on the subject of Zionism,
[3:15:07.560 --> 3:15:13.160]  you know, we have guests on here to talk about what Zionism is. And Zionism isn't a criticism
[3:15:13.160 --> 3:15:19.480]  of Jews themselves. Zionism is a political ideology very similar to what Hitler said.
[3:15:19.480 --> 3:15:26.920]  Or the white supremacists say or what the black Israel movement says. I mean, every group, Japan
[3:15:26.920 --> 3:15:32.280]  has a group that says that the master race and everybody else has come. And it says that everybody
[3:15:32.280 --> 3:15:40.120]  else are basically animals who can be killed and destroyed it will. And it's a horrible political
[3:15:40.120 --> 3:15:45.560]  system, certainly for the Palestinians and around Israel. And so I am in opposition to that apartheid
[3:15:45.560 --> 3:15:51.080]  type system. I think it's very hypocritical that Israel can do things that's way worse than what
[3:15:51.080 --> 3:15:56.520]  South Africa did. And it's OK with the media. But then what South Africa did was bad. No,
[3:15:56.520 --> 3:16:03.320]  it's both equally bad. And this is the thing. Humans do this to humans. Europeans, before
[3:16:03.320 --> 3:16:07.720]  they took over Africa, they had slave Europeans. And then as soon as they revolted, they said,
[3:16:07.720 --> 3:16:11.240]  well, we'll just grab these people as slaves. And they had black folks there selling them,
[3:16:11.240 --> 3:16:16.840]  you know, because blacks had black humans and slave each other. And we have to come to the
[3:16:16.840 --> 3:16:22.040]  realization of that system throughout history and expose it. I mean, what's the drug war?
[3:16:22.040 --> 3:16:27.080]  Millions and millions of nonviolent marijuana smokers staying in prison longer than violent
[3:16:27.080 --> 3:16:31.400]  offenders. Why? Because a marijuana smoker is a good worker. They're not on pot. They're not
[3:16:31.400 --> 3:16:44.600]  stoned. They're not cranking as Paul Hartman would say. And so it's slavery. It's slavery legalized.
[3:16:46.600 --> 3:16:51.800]  But I also don't like to bash Israel too much because I don't want to be in association with
[3:16:51.800 --> 3:16:57.080]  all the other tribal groups that make up exaggerated stuff about Israel, go crazy about Israel,
[3:16:57.080 --> 3:17:02.280]  hate all Jews, you know, make it a big thing. I don't like all this tribalism, all this racism,
[3:17:02.280 --> 3:17:06.040]  whatever you want to call it. Now, I just spent 10 minutes with one caller. I've got to somehow
[3:17:06.040 --> 3:17:10.520]  get to more callers here. But Michael in North Carolina, you're on the air. Welcome.
[3:17:12.360 --> 3:17:18.440]  I really enjoyed your speech. What speech was that?
[3:17:18.440 --> 3:17:27.560]  The speech that you were just talking about. Your three questions. I can't say I disagreed
[3:17:27.560 --> 3:17:32.520]  with anything that you said in particular. I would like you to talk a little bit more about
[3:17:32.520 --> 3:17:36.040]  Irving Fisher's stamp script. But that's about it.
[3:17:37.000 --> 3:17:42.520]  You know, I wrote about that. I'm familiar with it, but I'm not that big an expert on it. Why
[3:17:42.520 --> 3:17:49.480]  don't you explain it to folks? Okay, Irving Fisher's stamp script had to do with getting to the
[3:17:49.480 --> 3:17:58.040]  fundament of what is money and what is money has to do with labor. It doesn't have to do with the
[3:17:58.040 --> 3:18:02.760]  value of gold. It doesn't have to do with the value of silver or any other precious metals.
[3:18:02.760 --> 3:18:07.560]  It doesn't have to do with the value of land. It has to do with the value of labor
[3:18:07.560 --> 3:18:16.200]  and how you put, how you put value on that and how you trade value for that in small communities.
[3:18:17.320 --> 3:18:22.360]  Yes. And then getting local scripts, which everybody agrees upon. And then there's a
[3:18:22.360 --> 3:18:27.160]  known amount that's out there. And it's just an agreed upon mode of exchange for your labor,
[3:18:27.160 --> 3:18:34.280]  for your time, for your energy. And that's why I'm saying we need local currencies,
[3:18:34.280 --> 3:18:37.960]  currencies, competing with regional currencies, competing with national currencies, competing
[3:18:37.960 --> 3:18:43.560]  with international currencies. That way elites can't corner the market. It's a separation of powers
[3:18:43.560 --> 3:18:49.400]  within the entire monetary scheme. It is a liberalization of the symbols of credit.
[3:18:50.200 --> 3:18:55.560]  And that's what we need. We need liberation in the money system, but the average public,
[3:18:55.560 --> 3:18:59.400]  that's why we're enslaved. It's like, well, what's real money? I want money. You can show
[3:18:59.400 --> 3:19:04.680]  somebody a big wad, $100 bills, and they'll just get all excited. Oh, and all this is
[3:19:04.680 --> 3:19:08.280]  is something that was just printed up. The Federal Reserve orders it printed by the
[3:19:09.560 --> 3:19:13.960]  governmental treasury, and then it's issued, but that's less than 1% now of physical real
[3:19:13.960 --> 3:19:18.360]  money in circulation. It's all just zeros and ones in a computer. The bank just says you got
[3:19:18.360 --> 3:19:25.400]  $10,000 or $5,000 or a million, whatever it is in the bank. It's just zeros and ones. But by you
[3:19:25.400 --> 3:19:31.400]  going and depositing your little paper check in there, they loan out 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 times
[3:19:31.400 --> 3:19:36.680]  all the real physical money they've got in there leveraged. And so what does the bank really want?
[3:19:36.680 --> 3:19:40.760]  It wants you to go bankrupt because it doesn't care about the fake zeros and ones in its computer.
[3:19:40.760 --> 3:19:46.600]  It wants your house. It wants your company. It wants to set up a depression so everybody collapses.
[3:19:47.320 --> 3:19:53.080]  That's why they issue all this credit because they control it so that their false credit bubble
[3:19:53.080 --> 3:19:58.040]  of debt can implode and take over the entire economy with it. All right, more calls straight
[3:19:58.040 --> 3:20:24.040]  ahead right here on the one the only GCN radio network.
[3:20:58.920 --> 3:21:05.240]  Hello Ted Anderson listeners of the network are familiar with the Federal Reserve note and
[3:21:05.240 --> 3:21:10.440]  understand the risks of deficit spending. Therefore, with catastrophic events, it comes as no surprise
[3:21:10.440 --> 3:21:14.600]  that some banks have currently placed limits on the amount of cash depositors can remove from
[3:21:14.600 --> 3:21:19.400]  their accounts. A fractional reserve system means only a small portion of your deposit is held in
[3:21:19.400 --> 3:21:23.960]  reserve for immediate withdrawal. Deficit spending will skyrocket through FDIC if the government
[3:21:23.960 --> 3:21:29.000]  is forced to ensure deposits during a bank run followed by a depressed economy. A current effort
[3:21:29.000 --> 3:21:33.800]  is underway by the Fed along with other central banks to increase liquidity for depositors.
[3:21:33.800 --> 3:21:38.840]  However, an increase in money supply without equal expansion and productivity can cause inflation.
[3:21:38.840 --> 3:21:43.960]  In order to achieve strength and stability, I recommend a conservative portion of all investments
[3:21:43.960 --> 3:21:49.080]  to be calmly repositioned into gold and silver. While paper investments currently have been driven
[3:21:49.080 --> 3:21:57.240]  by debt, gold on its own has held value for over 6000 years. For more information call 1-800-686-2237.
[3:21:57.240 --> 3:22:05.800]  That's 1-800-686-2237. On September 11th, 2001, along with hundreds of my fellow troops, I went to
[3:22:05.800 --> 3:22:11.480]  grounds here and we knew what to do, or at least we thought we did. Truth Rising is a breakthrough
[3:22:11.480 --> 3:22:20.680]  9-11 film that finally gives first responders a platform to tell their story. Whitman, EPA director
[3:22:20.680 --> 3:22:27.240]  on the AT, made a statement that the air was safe to breathe. This film follows the growing
[3:22:27.240 --> 3:22:33.000]  momentum of 9-11 truth as brave souls throughout the world take action against their global masters.
[3:22:33.000 --> 3:22:37.560]  He had his hand over the radio while he was getting a countdown. He takes his hand off and you hear
[3:22:37.560 --> 3:22:45.080]  3-2-1 and it was boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. This is an emergency transmission worldwide.

[3:24:12.520 --> 3:24:16.520]  All right, let's try to get through some of these calls. Who's up next here, John?
[3:24:16.520 --> 3:24:25.400]  Joe in Chicago. You're on the air, Joe. Welcome. Hey, how's it going, Alex? Good, sir.
[3:24:26.360 --> 3:24:30.920]  Well, you know what? It's kind of funny the rise of phone calls that you're getting from Illinois
[3:24:30.920 --> 3:24:35.960]  in the Chicago area ever since Grobo Goyvic, this whole scandal came. Well, we've always
[3:24:35.960 --> 3:24:39.720]  gotten a lot of calls from Illinois, but yeah, we've been getting even more, I've noticed.
[3:24:40.440 --> 3:24:43.560]  Yeah, and I do have to say one thing about this guy. I mean,
[3:24:43.560 --> 3:24:51.880]  there was a commentator, political commentator on WGN News that basically said, this whole thing,
[3:24:52.440 --> 3:24:57.160]  he's like, it's basically, the whole impeachment panel was like, and I quote,
[3:24:57.160 --> 3:25:02.760]  he's like, it was like a bunch of flies hanging on a wall, all blaming one fly for having dirty feet.
[3:25:03.960 --> 3:25:08.520]  Okay. Yeah, but you can't accept the fact that they've all got dirty feet, but you don't take them out.
[3:25:08.520 --> 3:25:16.520]  That is true. That is true. But one thing that I saw that was really interesting, the day,
[3:25:17.400 --> 3:25:21.320]  the evening that he got back, I believe it was like last Tuesday or something like that,
[3:25:21.320 --> 3:25:29.880]  when after he got impeached, and they had like a kind of impromptu media conference
[3:25:29.880 --> 3:25:38.200]  out, you know, by front door, and he was talking about how, you know, basically his rights were
[3:25:38.200 --> 3:25:43.320]  violated as far as him not being able to bring forth, you know, any witness. That's right.
[3:25:43.320 --> 3:25:49.240]  And the Senate lied and said, we used the Bill Clinton rules, and Bill Clinton wasn't allowed
[3:25:49.240 --> 3:25:53.240]  to bring witnesses. Funny, I remember Bill Clinton brought a bunch of, including Verdon Jordan.
[3:25:53.240 --> 3:25:58.520]  So they are lying about the fact that, oh, well, it's normal to not allow people to call
[3:25:58.520 --> 3:26:06.680]  witnesses. And so definitely it's a corrupt system sacrificing him for some reason. And I
[3:26:06.680 --> 3:26:11.320]  don't know if that's the Bush administration, blackmailing Obama, because Blagojevic came up
[3:26:11.320 --> 3:26:17.240]  with him under the control of, you know, Blagojevic was a congressman, formerly too. So he's always
[3:26:17.240 --> 3:26:22.040]  worked with Rahm Emanuel, who's as dirty as they come. So, I mean, we don't know the full extent
[3:26:22.680 --> 3:26:27.160]  of this, but in the final equation, it's a diversion and a distraction to begin with.
[3:26:27.160 --> 3:26:33.080]  I mean, sure. Elliott Spitzer starts going after Bank of America and others for scams they're running,
[3:26:33.080 --> 3:26:37.480]  and suddenly, you know, his one impropriety with hookers, he was under FBI surveillance the whole
[3:26:37.480 --> 3:26:41.240]  time. They're all under surveillance, the British parliaments under surveillance. They're arresting
[3:26:41.240 --> 3:26:44.360]  members of parliament now when they leak information about government corruption,
[3:26:44.920 --> 3:26:49.000]  because the intelligence agencies that work for the big banks, they are the real government.
[3:26:49.560 --> 3:26:54.040]  And so this slapping governors around and congressmen around, and they're going after Wrangle
[3:26:54.040 --> 3:26:58.920]  right now and everybody else, that's about the real government, the military industrial complex,
[3:26:58.920 --> 3:27:04.280]  letting everybody know in line, we don't care how powerful you are, we'll crush you whenever we
[3:27:04.280 --> 3:27:08.760]  want. Even if you've got dirt on us, our media won't let that come out. And you don't get a fair
[3:27:08.760 --> 3:27:14.920]  trial. You understand. Right, right. Exactly. No, I mean, it's bad. And the thing that's really
[3:27:14.920 --> 3:27:20.360]  interesting about it is, which kind of hit home, I mean, even though, you know, he is a pseudo scumbag,
[3:27:20.360 --> 3:27:24.280]  you know, to begin with, but the thing that was really interesting that he said in his speech,
[3:27:24.280 --> 3:27:27.800]  which, you know, it's getting kind of, he was getting kind of teary eyed and stuff like that.
[3:27:27.800 --> 3:27:32.200]  But the one thing that he did say is he talked about, you know, his first amendment rights,
[3:27:32.200 --> 3:27:37.560]  he talked about all of his rights to be able to speak about this. And he says, if you think that
[3:27:37.560 --> 3:27:43.960]  they would do this to a governor, what do you think that they would do to you, the ordinary
[3:27:43.960 --> 3:27:50.600]  citizens fighting also fighting for your rights? I hear you. I appreciate your call. Yeah, it's
[3:27:50.600 --> 3:27:54.680]  bad. You know, the reason I don't care if they destroy him, you know, even if they're violating
[3:27:54.680 --> 3:27:58.760]  his rights. I mean, I am against that, but I'm certainly wanting to be able to call witnesses,
[3:27:58.760 --> 3:28:04.440]  but that doesn't mean that I'm going to cry tears from Blagojevic. The guy three months ago
[3:28:05.480 --> 3:28:09.160]  said he's calling out the National Guard for door to door gun confiscation in Illinois.
[3:28:09.160 --> 3:28:13.720]  I mean, he's, he's, he's evil folks. He's
[3:28:16.760 --> 3:28:23.080]  Tommy in Michigan. You're on the air. Go ahead, Tommy. Alex. Hello, Alex. Hey,
[3:28:24.120 --> 3:28:30.360]  okay. Hey, I got a couple of questions for you here. Can you hear me? Loud and clear, brother.
[3:28:31.000 --> 3:28:36.680]  All right. All right. So I don't really see people standing up against this whole new world order
[3:28:36.680 --> 3:28:41.400]  thing because from what I've come across on the internet these days, it's like people
[3:28:41.400 --> 3:28:47.560]  are just, they're just arguing with each other. Yeah. They're trying to be slaves. Yeah. Yeah.
[3:28:47.560 --> 3:28:53.720]  And they claim their old one, you know, anti new world order. I'm going to change this and
[3:28:54.440 --> 3:28:58.920]  you know, they've come out of, they've run out of things to really talk about. And they mainly
[3:28:58.920 --> 3:29:05.000]  talk about me. Exactly. They talk about me more than they talk about Obama. I mean, I'm literally,
[3:29:05.000 --> 3:29:09.240]  I'm like, well, which actually only helps me. I love the fact they spend their energy
[3:29:09.240 --> 3:29:14.200]  attacking me everywhere. People just, just remember my name and go check it out. That's the
[3:29:14.200 --> 3:29:18.040]  big dirty secret is that I actually love it. I mean, it's all a bunch of baloney anyways,
[3:29:18.040 --> 3:29:23.800]  is not true. None of it sticks. So let them make up whatever malarkey they want. But
[3:29:25.000 --> 3:29:27.720]  let me comment on that when we come back. Anything else you want to add, sir?
[3:29:27.720 --> 3:29:34.360]  Um, yeah, I'll stick around. Well, just go ahead and add it now. Go ahead. Okay. Well, um, yes.
[3:29:35.400 --> 3:29:39.160]  I guess that's it, Alex. I appreciate it. Good to hear from you. I'm going to comment
[3:29:39.800 --> 3:29:46.440]  on what you had to say when we come back. Okay. This is key information straight ahead
[3:29:46.440 --> 3:29:54.600]  after this quick break. We'll be back in three. We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[3:29:54.600 --> 3:29:58.280]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:01.960 --> 3:30:06.600]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water. And did you know that you have
[3:30:06.600 --> 3:30:11.160]  greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water? That's
[3:30:11.160 --> 3:30:15.960]  because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others are absorbed into the skin.
[3:30:15.960 --> 3:30:21.800]  The KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold water and is designed to reduce chlorine,
[3:30:21.800 --> 3:30:27.480]  lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[3:30:27.480 --> 3:30:33.320]  The KDF dual media shower filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons or one year, whichever comes first.
[3:30:33.320 --> 3:30:37.640]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities uses media to reduce chlorine,
[3:30:37.640 --> 3:30:42.600]  iron, heavy metals, and bacteria. What about you? Order your KDF shower filter normally,

[3:31:31.400 --> 3:31:35.320]  I'm aware that some Israeli citizens have been detained.
[3:31:35.320 --> 3:31:39.000]  In Laden's connections to the CIA, the hijackers ties to the FBI,
[3:31:39.000 --> 3:31:43.240]  the Saudi Arabian connection, the Israeli intelligence network, warnings in war games,
[3:31:43.240 --> 3:31:49.000]  the shadow government, and much, much more. Fabled enemies. Get the DVD at infowars.com,

[3:32:01.000 --> 3:32:07.000]  People around the world are testifying that their cataracts are quickly disappearing like magic thanks to Can-See.
[3:32:07.000 --> 3:32:17.000]  The original Can-See eye drop used in clinical trials maintains that only the original unadulterated formula is effective in reducing, reversing and slowing the occurrence of senile cataract.
[3:32:17.000 --> 3:32:21.000]  Can-See can also assist in lowering the intraocular pressure associated with glaucoma.
[3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:28.000]  Can-See is beneficial for contact lens disorders to treat corneal disorders, combat eye strain, kidneys, computer vision syndrome and more.
[3:32:28.000 --> 3:32:34.000]  People enjoying the benefits while using Can-See report no side effects and the drops are gentle and don't cause eye burning.
[3:32:34.000 --> 3:32:42.000]  With regular use, people using Can-See drops report a difference in their vision in as little as 30 days and some have their cataracts completely disappear within months.
[3:32:42.000 --> 3:32:52.000]  Can-See is available now by calling 888-212-8871 or order online at Nutramedical.com.
[3:32:52.000 --> 3:33:12.000]  That's N-U-T-R-I-Medical.com, your source for the most powerful nutraceuticals and wellness protocols from a doctor you can trust.
[3:33:23.000 --> 3:33:25.000]  Oh, Smokey!
[3:33:40.000 --> 3:33:41.000]  Alright!
[3:33:42.000 --> 3:33:45.000]  To answer that last caller's question.
[3:33:45.000 --> 3:33:56.000]  Alright, we'll do that and then we will go back to your phone calls and some economic news that I haven't covered yet.
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:33:59.000]  But first, I like this one little part coming up.
[3:33:59.000 --> 3:34:01.000]  No, I don't have time to play the song.
[3:34:01.000 --> 3:34:03.000]  Whole Smokey's got his ears on.
[3:34:03.000 --> 3:34:07.000]  He's hot on your tail and he ain't gonna rest till you're in jail.
[3:34:07.000 --> 3:34:09.000]  So you got to dodge him, you got to duck him.
[3:34:09.000 --> 3:34:11.000]  You gotta keep that diesel truckin'.
[3:34:11.000 --> 3:34:14.000]  So let that hammer down and give it hell.
[3:34:14.000 --> 3:34:15.000]  Alright.
[3:34:15.000 --> 3:34:20.000]  Little Alex Jones Carrier or Key Torture for everybody.
[3:34:26.000 --> 3:34:28.000]  You know, so what?
[3:34:28.000 --> 3:34:35.000]  I would talk about this type of news 13 years ago and most people would laugh at me.
[3:34:35.000 --> 3:34:38.000]  And then about 10 years ago, about half people would laugh at me.
[3:34:38.000 --> 3:34:41.000]  And then about 3 years ago, 10% people would laugh at me.
[3:34:41.000 --> 3:34:45.000]  And now I do radio talk shows every week where people are attacking me.
[3:34:45.000 --> 3:34:49.000]  The host is attacking me and every single caller calls in and agrees.
[3:34:49.000 --> 3:34:51.000]  And the host gets mad.
[3:34:51.000 --> 3:34:54.000]  Canada, England, the United States.
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:56.000]  Period.
[3:34:58.000 --> 3:35:02.000]  So let people continue to attack.
[3:35:02.000 --> 3:35:03.000]  They've all been proven wrong.
[3:35:03.000 --> 3:35:05.000]  Everything we've talked about has happened.
[3:35:05.000 --> 3:35:08.000]  And I say unfortunately because I wish we could have turned all this around.
[3:35:08.000 --> 3:35:12.000]  I wish I wasn't right about all this, but I was reading ran corporation documents, CFR documents,
[3:35:12.000 --> 3:35:14.000]  declassified CIA documents.
[3:35:14.000 --> 3:35:16.000]  That's what I do.
[3:35:16.000 --> 3:35:18.000]  And so I know what was going to happen, so I've been proven right.
[3:35:18.000 --> 3:35:21.000]  So my stock goes up, mainstream media stock goes down.
[3:35:21.000 --> 3:35:24.000]  And it goes for the entire alternative media.
[3:35:24.000 --> 3:35:26.000]  There's a lot of bull out there and alternative media as well.
[3:35:26.000 --> 3:35:28.000]  But people learn what to trust and what not to trust.
[3:35:28.000 --> 3:35:31.000]  People know the government's out there with disinfo on the Internet now.
[3:35:31.000 --> 3:35:33.000]  Attacking people, that's now admitted.
[3:35:33.000 --> 3:35:34.000]  What before, now it's admitted.
[3:35:34.000 --> 3:35:35.000]  My stock goes up again.
[3:35:35.000 --> 3:35:36.000]  I told people.
[3:35:36.000 --> 3:35:38.000]  Pentagon admits they go after me.
[3:35:38.000 --> 3:35:42.000]  They show 9-11 truth groups in Congress saying these are terrorists.
[3:35:42.000 --> 3:35:44.000]  We've got to shut down the web because of them.
[3:35:44.000 --> 3:35:47.000]  People hear that and just come and check us out even more.
[3:35:47.000 --> 3:35:50.000]  So fortune does favor the bold.
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:52.000]  And the fortune we're looking for is liberty and freedom.
[3:35:52.000 --> 3:35:55.000]  And as things get darker and darker and more serious, folks are going to wake up.
[3:35:55.000 --> 3:35:57.000]  So understand something.
[3:35:57.000 --> 3:36:03.000]  It was about 2% that started the Revolutionary War against the British because of their abuses in 1775.
[3:36:03.000 --> 3:36:06.000]  And then it kicked off officially in 1776.
[3:36:06.000 --> 3:36:11.000]  And only 5% were involved for the entire war against the British.
[3:36:11.000 --> 3:36:13.000]  The majority of people were Tories.
[3:36:13.000 --> 3:36:15.000]  They were for the system.
[3:36:15.000 --> 3:36:18.000]  George Washington just wasn't fighting the British, the greatest army ever in the world.
[3:36:18.000 --> 3:36:21.000]  Never been defeated in ground fights.
[3:36:21.000 --> 3:36:27.000]  He was fighting the people who were mainly British who wanted to go along as cowards.
[3:36:27.000 --> 3:36:32.000]  Now by the time they started winning, 7 years in, around 20% of the public started saying they were for it.
[3:36:32.000 --> 3:36:37.000]  Guess what happened to hundreds of thousands of people who'd been prominent for the British?
[3:36:37.000 --> 3:36:39.000]  They were very nice.
[3:36:39.000 --> 3:36:43.000]  The founders let them sell their property for value, gave them a year to get out and said,
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:46.000]  go to Canada or go to England, get out of here.
[3:36:46.000 --> 3:36:48.000]  Leave or we're going to hang you.
[3:36:48.000 --> 3:36:52.000]  Because they'd engage in all sorts of atrocities, killing people, murdering.
[3:36:52.000 --> 3:36:56.000]  Except you see in that movie, the Patriots, true story, burning them up in the church.
[3:36:56.000 --> 3:36:58.000]  They did that all over the place.
[3:36:58.000 --> 3:37:01.000]  Concentration camps, you name it.
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:05.000]  So we've got more than 5% here in the Info War.
[3:37:05.000 --> 3:37:07.000]  We don't want it to become physical.
[3:37:07.000 --> 3:37:09.000]  But if we have to defend ourselves, that's the way it is.
[3:37:09.000 --> 3:37:11.000]  We've got 5% of the public.
[3:37:11.000 --> 3:37:13.000]  We've gotten probably 10% that really knows what's going on.
[3:37:13.000 --> 3:37:15.000]  Just a lot of them are scared and aren't in the fight yet.
[3:37:15.000 --> 3:37:20.000]  If you look at the abolitionist movement in 1800, you can go pull these numbers up.
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:23.000]  Less than 2% of the British population were abolitionists.
[3:37:23.000 --> 3:37:26.000]  Less than 2% of the American population here in the United States.
[3:37:26.000 --> 3:37:33.000]  2% go forward 60-something years and they were now the majority in the south.
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:36.000]  The majority in the north and the minority in the south.
[3:37:36.000 --> 3:37:39.000]  But the point is only what 3% of people in the south owned slaves.
[3:37:39.000 --> 3:37:41.000]  That was a minority.
[3:37:41.000 --> 3:37:43.000]  They were the only ones at the end that were actually for it.
[3:37:43.000 --> 3:37:50.000]  But you're talking about the vast minority just 60-something years later who were for slavery and it was outlawed.
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:52.000]  With the Emancipation Proclamation.
[3:37:52.000 --> 3:37:58.000]  So you can look at that 2% in the north in 1800 and people laughing at them.
[3:37:58.000 --> 3:38:00.000]  People saying they were idiots.
[3:38:00.000 --> 3:38:01.000]  They had no power.
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:02.000]  It was a joke.
[3:38:02.000 --> 3:38:04.000]  They were fools.
[3:38:04.000 --> 3:38:06.000]  But you saw England outlaw slavery.
[3:38:06.000 --> 3:38:07.000]  You saw Latin America.
[3:38:07.000 --> 3:38:10.000]  The country's down there outlawed by the 1830s and 40s depending on the nation.
[3:38:10.000 --> 3:38:12.000]  You see Mexico outlaw slavery.
[3:38:12.000 --> 3:38:17.000]  You see slavery being outlawed all over the world.
[3:38:17.000 --> 3:38:21.000]  You saw slavery being outlawed in areas of Asia separately.
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:23.000]  You know that was Asians with Asian slaves.
[3:38:23.000 --> 3:38:25.000]  They call it the caste system.
[3:38:25.000 --> 3:38:27.000]  Where do you still have slavery today?
[3:38:27.000 --> 3:38:28.000]  India.
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:30.000]  Only place and it's the color of your skin.
[3:38:30.000 --> 3:38:32.000]  It's a caste system.
[3:38:32.000 --> 3:38:38.000]  Because Europeans about 4,000 years ago came in to northern India and they set up a caste system there.
[3:38:38.000 --> 3:38:40.000]  That's what groups always do to each other.
[3:38:40.000 --> 3:38:44.000]  They've got caste systems in Africa where one tribe is bigger has the other.
[3:38:44.000 --> 3:38:47.000]  That's how humans when they get out of control operate.
[3:38:47.000 --> 3:38:52.000]  So people can sit here all dancing.
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:54.000]  I'm just one person in this fight.
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:58.000]  I'm just one little piece of the fight against corruption and tyranny.
[3:38:58.000 --> 3:39:04.000]  And I know that as you wake up others and as the enemy squeezes tighter and tighter, we have the moral ground.
[3:39:04.000 --> 3:39:06.000]  I don't care how much propaganda the establishment has.
[3:39:06.000 --> 3:39:08.000]  How much spin they've got.
[3:39:08.000 --> 3:39:14.000]  The police running around in black uniforms tasering people and cameras in school rooms and bathrooms is tyranny is wrong.
[3:39:14.000 --> 3:39:19.000]  And private offshore banks looting the country and setting up tyrannies wrong.
[3:39:19.000 --> 3:39:21.000]  And it's going to fall.
[3:39:21.000 --> 3:39:24.000]  The question is how far will the tyranny get before it falls.
[3:39:24.000 --> 3:39:27.000]  And so just saying nobody's going to do anything.
[3:39:27.000 --> 3:39:28.000]  People are doing things.
[3:39:28.000 --> 3:39:29.000]  People are doing a lot.
[3:39:29.000 --> 3:39:34.000]  We'd be in a lot worse situation right now if people hadn't stood up to tyranny and hadn't warned folks.
[3:39:34.000 --> 3:39:38.000]  What do people 10, 15, 20 years ago talking about the New World Order hadn't done what they did.
[3:39:38.000 --> 3:39:41.000]  We wouldn't have all this credibility right now.
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:43.000]  But we told everybody it was going to happen.
[3:39:43.000 --> 3:39:44.000]  We were right.
[3:39:44.000 --> 3:39:47.000]  The enemy moved forward and now people are listening.
[3:39:47.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  So it's up to us now as we see everything unfolding, not to whine and complain and bitch about it.
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:53.000]  But to say, okay, we were right.
[3:39:53.000 --> 3:39:54.000]  Let's do something about it.
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:55.000]  It's all people on the fence.
[3:39:55.000 --> 3:39:57.000]  Okay, you didn't believe FEMA camps were real?
[3:39:57.000 --> 3:39:59.000]  Here it is in a bunch of newspapers.
[3:39:59.000 --> 3:40:01.000]  Okay, you didn't believe that the WMDs were staged?
[3:40:01.000 --> 3:40:02.000]  Well, now it's admitted.
[3:40:02.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  Okay, well, you didn't believe that Barack Obama was going to keep the secret arrest and torture going?
[3:40:06.000 --> 3:40:08.000]  Here's his own executive order.
[3:40:08.000 --> 3:40:10.000]  You don't believe the mainstream media is lying?
[3:40:10.000 --> 3:40:12.000]  They told you he got rid of this.
[3:40:12.000 --> 3:40:13.000]  Whitehouse.gov.
[3:40:13.000 --> 3:40:14.000]  Here it is.
[3:40:14.000 --> 3:40:15.000]  He didn't do that.
[3:40:15.000 --> 3:40:16.000]  He lied to you.
[3:40:16.000 --> 3:40:17.000]  Now, what are you going to do about that?
[3:40:17.000 --> 3:40:20.000]  What are you going to say about that?
[3:40:20.000 --> 3:40:25.000]  And there's thousands of other issues and I can rant all day about it.
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:27.000]  So, look, keep the attacks going.
[3:40:27.000 --> 3:40:28.000]  Keep lying about me.
[3:40:28.000 --> 3:40:29.000]  Keep doing everything you're doing.
[3:40:29.000 --> 3:40:30.000]  Just spell my name right.
[3:40:30.000 --> 3:40:35.000]  It's ALEX, J-O-N-E-S, infowars.com, prisonplanet.com.
[3:40:35.000 --> 3:40:36.000]  Just keep attacking.
[3:40:36.000 --> 3:40:38.000]  Just just keep it going.
[3:40:38.000 --> 3:40:42.000]  Please, I want you to intensify it more, more, more, more.
[3:40:42.000 --> 3:40:48.000]  Give me more because all your curses and all your attacks are just blessings to me in the end.
[3:40:48.000 --> 3:40:51.000]  God just turns it right around and turns it into something good.
[3:40:51.000 --> 3:40:56.000]  So just please, if you strike me down, and I don't want that to happen because I've got work to do,
[3:40:56.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  but even if they strike me down, that just gets bigger.
[3:41:00.000 --> 3:41:02.000]  What did Thomas Jefferson say?
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:08.000]  Tree of Liberty must be nourished from time to time, must be fed, must be watered.
[3:41:08.000 --> 3:41:15.000]  The Tree of Liberty must be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:17.000]  So understand that, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:41:17.000 --> 3:41:18.000]  That's why they probably won't kill me.
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:21.000]  They'll destroy me in the media.
[3:41:21.000 --> 3:41:24.000]  But there's not much to go after me on.
[3:41:24.000 --> 3:41:26.000]  I'm a pretty boring guy.
[3:41:26.000 --> 3:41:28.000]  So they'll try to manufacture stuff.
[3:41:28.000 --> 3:41:29.000]  That doesn't work anymore.
[3:41:29.000 --> 3:41:31.000]  People know they're a pack of liars.
[3:41:31.000 --> 3:41:35.000]  It's a complete open criminal and people are defending him because they know he's the underdog.
[3:41:35.000 --> 3:41:42.000]  They know the system's so corrupt that even though that guy's corrupt, he must have done something against them.
[3:41:42.000 --> 3:41:44.000]  The system is shot, folks.
[3:41:44.000 --> 3:41:45.000]  It's got to be reworked.
[3:41:45.000 --> 3:41:46.000]  It's got to be recreated.
[3:41:46.000 --> 3:41:49.000]  Real change, not phony-Obamanoid change.
[3:41:49.000 --> 3:41:56.000]  Obama, Obama, Bush.
[3:41:56.000 --> 3:42:00.000]  You got all these neocons now, all these super right wing people saying, I like Obama.
[3:42:00.000 --> 3:42:04.000]  Yeah, he's starting new wars, circling Russia, setting up a police stay.
[3:42:04.000 --> 3:42:05.000]  They love him.
[3:42:05.000 --> 3:42:08.000]  Pat Robertson's endorsing.
[3:42:08.000 --> 3:42:10.000]  What does that tell you out there?
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:12.000]  That means they're making their move with this guy.
[3:42:12.000 --> 3:42:17.000]  And so am I going to wimp out and wait until people wake up to him to attack him and go after him politically?
[3:42:17.000 --> 3:42:18.000]  No.
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:19.000]  I'm stepping right up to the president.
[3:42:19.000 --> 3:42:23.000]  They know that I've produced some of the most viral videos in history, hundreds of millions of views online.
[3:42:23.000 --> 3:42:25.000]  They'll probably try all kinds of crap.
[3:42:25.000 --> 3:42:26.000]  We've had all sorts of stuff going on.
[3:42:26.000 --> 3:42:27.000]  Good.
[3:42:27.000 --> 3:42:29.000]  I'm here to fight the new world order.
[3:42:29.000 --> 3:42:32.000]  I'm not here to suck my thumb and play games.
[3:42:32.000 --> 3:42:38.000]  I'm here to go toe-to-toe 110% and they may kick my butt in the ring, but I'm here in the ring.
[3:42:38.000 --> 3:42:39.000]  And you better believe this.
[3:42:39.000 --> 3:42:40.000]  You attack my liberty.
[3:42:40.000 --> 3:42:41.000]  You attack my freedom.
[3:42:41.000 --> 3:42:42.000]  You attack my country.
[3:42:42.000 --> 3:42:43.000]  You attack my family.
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:44.000]  I'm going to fight back.
[3:42:44.000 --> 3:42:49.000]  And you may beat me, but you better believe I'm going to keep swinging all the way.
[3:42:49.000 --> 3:42:52.000]  And I kick like a mule and I bite like a crocodile.
[3:42:52.000 --> 3:42:54.000]  And so do the American people.
[3:42:54.000 --> 3:42:58.000]  So we need to come together against the new world order and stop forgetting race, religion,
[3:42:58.000 --> 3:42:59.000]  and all this stuff we fight about.
[3:42:59.000 --> 3:43:06.000]  We need to agree on liberty and freedom and the destruction of tyranny in the new world order.
[3:43:06.000 --> 3:43:08.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to who's up next here.
[3:43:08.000 --> 3:43:11.000]  Annie in New York.
[3:43:11.000 --> 3:43:12.000]  Hello, Alex.
[3:43:12.000 --> 3:43:13.000]  Hi, Annie.
[3:43:13.000 --> 3:43:15.000]  I think you're wonderful.
[3:43:15.000 --> 3:43:22.000]  I was working the night that you went after Geraldo and I worked in McGraw Hill Building
[3:43:22.000 --> 3:43:24.000]  and I watched that whole thing.
[3:43:24.000 --> 3:43:25.000]  It was quite amazing.
[3:43:25.000 --> 3:43:27.000]  Did you watch it out the window?
[3:43:27.000 --> 3:43:28.000]  I was working.
[3:43:28.000 --> 3:43:31.000]  300 demonstrators taking over their live broadcast.
[3:43:31.000 --> 3:43:32.000]  That was beautiful.
[3:43:32.000 --> 3:43:33.000]  It was great.
[3:43:33.000 --> 3:43:34.000]  It was wonderful.
[3:43:34.000 --> 3:43:37.000]  But I wanted to ask you a couple of things.
[3:43:37.000 --> 3:43:39.500]  It's so difficult for people.
[3:43:39.500 --> 3:43:41.000]  I'm one of eight children.
[3:43:41.000 --> 3:43:44.600]  I'm a baby boomer, but I've been following this stuff.
[3:43:44.600 --> 3:43:50.000]  I used to work for FEMA and following this stuff for years and thank God got acquainted
[3:43:50.000 --> 3:43:52.200]  with you and your site.
[3:43:52.200 --> 3:43:59.200]  The problem is trying to convince people who you know, people who you share values with
[3:43:59.200 --> 3:44:00.400]  and they're intelligent people.
[3:44:00.400 --> 3:44:06.200]  They work for universities and major corporations, but they just won't come and see the light
[3:44:06.200 --> 3:44:11.280]  and I just get scared that this might be the make or break year 2009.
[3:44:11.280 --> 3:44:13.920]  That's because subconsciously they know it's true.
[3:44:13.920 --> 3:44:14.920]  They're afraid.
[3:44:14.920 --> 3:44:16.560]  They go, oh, no, no, no.
[3:44:16.560 --> 3:44:17.560]  Everything's fine.
[3:44:17.560 --> 3:44:18.560]  Oh, no, no, everything.
[3:44:18.560 --> 3:44:19.560]  I don't want to hear it.
[3:44:19.560 --> 3:44:23.080]  I've seen people, I've had family cousins and people over and I've tried to give them
[3:44:23.080 --> 3:44:24.720]  a DVD and they act like it's a snake.
[3:44:24.720 --> 3:44:26.280]  Oh, no, no, no, no.
[3:44:26.280 --> 3:44:27.280]  You know what?
[3:44:27.280 --> 3:44:28.280]  Because they know it's real.
[3:44:28.280 --> 3:44:29.280]  But go ahead.
[3:44:29.280 --> 3:44:35.640]  I appreciate that point of view because when I tried to get people to watch loose change,
[3:44:35.640 --> 3:44:40.320]  it was almost like they were little kids and they were breaking one of the church commandments
[3:44:40.320 --> 3:44:41.880]  and they were going to get caught.
[3:44:41.880 --> 3:44:43.960]  They were so afraid, but they did watch it.
[3:44:43.960 --> 3:44:47.400]  Well, that's a good way to get our material out because it is avant-garde.
[3:44:47.400 --> 3:44:48.400]  It is cutting edge.
[3:44:48.400 --> 3:44:49.400]  It is underground.
[3:44:49.400 --> 3:44:50.400]  It's dangerous.
[3:44:50.400 --> 3:44:52.560]  You tell them, this is a super suppressed video, which it is.
[3:44:52.560 --> 3:44:55.800]  They're trying to erase them and shut down in-game terror storm, all these powerful films
[3:44:55.800 --> 3:45:01.200]  and you tell them, well, this is hardcore and they'll run home and, you know, anything
[3:45:01.200 --> 3:45:02.200]  else?
[3:45:02.200 --> 3:45:03.200]  Absolutely.
[3:45:03.200 --> 3:45:09.480]  It would be helpful if one of your writers, you know, like the Five Steps of Grieving,
[3:45:09.480 --> 3:45:14.600]  there's also a process like that akin with coming to grips with what the heck is going
[3:45:14.600 --> 3:45:18.240]  on, you know, and anger, I feel a lot of anger.
[3:45:18.240 --> 3:45:22.920]  I'm over the shock between your stuff and crossing the Rubicon and I really like that
[3:45:22.920 --> 3:45:26.840]  new site that you, the August review, that was very helpful.
[3:45:26.840 --> 3:45:31.920]  But it would be great if somebody could put together, you know, the steps of not grieving,
[3:45:31.920 --> 3:45:34.320]  but coming to grips with the horrible-
[3:45:34.320 --> 3:45:35.680]  Ma'am, we're trying to expand.
[3:45:35.680 --> 3:45:39.800]  We've got three writers that are full-time, a couple that are part-time and some folks
[3:45:39.800 --> 3:45:43.720]  that are guest contributors that we appreciate.
[3:45:43.720 --> 3:45:47.000]  We're trying to expand and we're doing it while everything's imploding.
[3:45:47.000 --> 3:45:48.680]  So yes, we're trying to do that.
[3:45:48.680 --> 3:45:49.680]  We're going to add a lot.
[3:45:49.680 --> 3:45:51.680]  In the next few months, people are going to see it.
[3:45:51.680 --> 3:45:54.920]  So two films a year, three, four films a year.
[3:45:54.920 --> 3:45:56.240]  More, well, just wait.
[3:45:56.240 --> 3:46:00.160]  You're going to see some new things happening here and anything else you want to add?
[3:46:00.160 --> 3:46:01.160]  I do.
[3:46:01.160 --> 3:46:07.920]  I wonder if you think that peak oil will play any role in putting the, you know, kibosh
[3:46:07.920 --> 3:46:10.280]  to their, the global movement.
[3:46:10.280 --> 3:46:11.280]  I mean-
[3:46:11.280 --> 3:46:12.280]  It's contrary.
[3:46:12.280 --> 3:46:15.760]  You know, when you mentioned Rupert, he would talk about 98% accurate and they would
[3:46:15.760 --> 3:46:16.760]  add some things.
[3:46:16.760 --> 3:46:19.280]  Rupert called for population reduction, right?
[3:46:19.280 --> 3:46:20.480]  I did not know that.
[3:46:20.480 --> 3:46:26.280]  Yeah, he wrote that and has given speeches on it and he kind of, you know, he's retired,
[3:46:26.280 --> 3:46:29.840]  I guess, to put it lightly these days.
[3:46:29.840 --> 3:46:36.360]  Peak oil is actually, they want to reduce resources to control the population.
[3:46:36.360 --> 3:46:42.360]  But certainly, well, let's just put this way, peak oil is one area that I think you
[3:46:42.360 --> 3:46:45.600]  should look at the alternatives on and the research, okay?
[3:46:45.600 --> 3:46:48.280]  Good to hear from you though, great to have you on board with us as a listener.
[3:46:48.280 --> 3:46:51.480]  I'm going to come back, well, I'm going to plug these sponsors, then I'm going to go
[3:46:51.480 --> 3:46:52.480]  to some more of your calls.
[3:46:52.480 --> 3:46:54.480]  And I do have some economic news I want to hit.
[3:46:54.480 --> 3:46:58.720]  All these top economists are talking about, we are already in a depression, even the
[3:46:58.720 --> 3:47:04.880]  Economist magazine, which is as prestigious as it gets, I mean, it's, it's, it's economists
[3:47:04.880 --> 3:47:09.200]  that write it, it's, it's, it's kind of a prestigious internal journal that's sold
[3:47:09.200 --> 3:47:10.200]  on newsstands.
[3:47:10.200 --> 3:47:13.320]  I mean, these are actual white papers that are in it.
[3:47:13.320 --> 3:47:19.480]  And they're saying that, and I got a few other economic stories I wanted to hit on.
[3:47:19.480 --> 3:47:24.200]  But before I do that, I had one more sponsor that I wanted to tell folks about that is
[3:47:24.200 --> 3:47:28.360]  making this show possible, plus they're just great folks and that's eFoodsDirect.com, the
[3:47:28.360 --> 3:47:30.000]  J. Michael Stevens group.
[3:47:30.000 --> 3:47:37.480]  The website is just the letter eFoodsDirect.com and they have a deal going, I'm told just
[3:47:37.480 --> 3:47:41.560]  a few more weeks where you can get a sampler pack, it's a three-day responder kit, it's
[3:47:41.560 --> 3:47:46.440]  what it's called, it's a, it's, it's a large servings for one person for three days for
[3:47:46.440 --> 3:47:51.280]  $21 of high quality, non-GMO food.
[3:47:51.280 --> 3:47:56.520]  And just to try it, it's the three-day responder, three-day one adult food supply for only $21.95
[3:47:56.520 --> 3:48:01.600]  give, and this is at cost by the way they're doing this as a promotion, and then decide
[3:48:01.600 --> 3:48:03.200]  to get a year's supply or six months' supply.
[3:48:03.200 --> 3:48:07.040]  They have a boogie pack, one month's supply for an adult that just is in a box about this
[3:48:07.040 --> 3:48:11.880]  big that just fits in your, that just fits in your trunk.
[3:48:11.880 --> 3:48:20.440]  So again, eFoodsDirect.com or 800-409-5633, 800-409-5633, they have a lot of great videos
[3:48:20.440 --> 3:48:22.800]  and material as well for free on their website about the products.
[3:48:22.800 --> 3:48:25.680]  They're the longest continually operating, they're the biggest horrible foods company,
[3:48:25.680 --> 3:48:29.440]  they're the folks I trust, eFoodsDirect.com, they're patriots like us.
[3:48:29.440 --> 3:48:33.000]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to another phone call here.
[3:48:33.000 --> 3:48:35.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to Ronnie in Texas.
[3:48:35.840 --> 3:48:38.680]  Ronnie, you're on the air, welcome.
[3:48:38.680 --> 3:48:39.680]  Thank you, sir.
[3:48:39.680 --> 3:48:44.440]  Alex, help support our troops, decriminalize medicinal marijuana because many of our brave
[3:48:44.440 --> 3:48:49.920]  troops experience traumatic brain injuries, TBIs, from IEDs, and all the studies of major
[3:48:49.920 --> 3:48:56.120]  medical institutions, not the marijuana lobby, the ragtag lobby, but major studies say it
[3:48:56.120 --> 3:48:59.920]  is great for brain trauma, great for PTSD.
[3:48:59.920 --> 3:49:04.000]  They've done placebo tests with Prozac and sugar pill, and Prozac is actually bad for
[3:49:04.000 --> 3:49:08.520]  PTSD, but they put them on it when marijuana helps them, and I totally agree with you.
[3:49:08.520 --> 3:49:13.480]  And again, I'm not a marijuana guy, I mean I've smoked marijuana before, and every few
[3:49:13.480 --> 3:49:17.040]  years I'll go, I'll be at an event or something, I go, okay, and then I go, oh, now I remember
[3:49:17.040 --> 3:49:23.240]  why I don't smoke this, I don't like this, but I really think that, well, I mean I agree
[3:49:23.240 --> 3:49:24.240]  with you.
[3:49:24.240 --> 3:49:27.360]  Well, the point I want to try to make is now is the time for our returning troops to have
[3:49:27.360 --> 3:49:31.880]  medicinal marijuana, because it's at least an option to help them, their recovery from
[3:49:31.880 --> 3:49:36.600]  TBIs, and it's so crucial, I mean, we want, everybody wants to help our troops, and there's
[3:49:36.600 --> 3:49:40.840]  a, the reason I think that we're going to put this medicinal marijuana issue over the
[3:49:40.840 --> 3:49:44.440]  line, because who doesn't want to help our troops, and not to get sick.
[3:49:44.440 --> 3:49:49.160]  Now you know why glaucoma, you know, glaucoma's pressure in the eye, inflammation inside, it
[3:49:49.160 --> 3:49:56.080]  makes you go blind, it's the number one treatment now, the most effective THC drops in the eye,
[3:49:56.080 --> 3:49:59.280]  and my grandmother even had glaucoma, and they, you know, gave her those drops, and
[3:49:59.280 --> 3:50:00.560]  it worked for her.
[3:50:00.560 --> 3:50:05.400]  And so why is that, the eyes are part of the brain, you know, they grow out in the embryonic
[3:50:05.400 --> 3:50:09.720]  development, and a lot of times the person also has inflammation of the brain from MSG,
[3:50:09.720 --> 3:50:13.600]  aspartame, fluoride, things in the water, and that's why with brain injuries, some brain
[3:50:13.600 --> 3:50:19.800]  injuries on all of them, they found that marijuana is good, because it does reduce brain inflammation,
[3:50:19.800 --> 3:50:23.640]  swelling, just like it does for the eye, and so I guess you've done your research that
[3:50:23.640 --> 3:50:27.560]  yes, marijuana is medicinal with brain swelling and inflammation.
[3:50:27.560 --> 3:50:32.400]  I know from my own experience, distilled cannabis, essential oil, has been found to be a cure
[3:50:32.400 --> 3:50:36.880]  all for many ailments, and there are a few, there are a few plants that you can really
[3:50:36.880 --> 3:50:42.240]  call wondrous, and none of them stand above, not, you know, not the plant they get bear
[3:50:42.240 --> 3:50:50.560]  aspirin out of, not Malaluga, or not, nothing compares, I mean, not the aloe vera plant.
[3:50:50.560 --> 3:50:55.040]  Marijuana is, I've seen all the studies, it's just an absolutely fantastic thing, and that's
[3:50:55.040 --> 3:50:58.360]  why it's banned in this country, because the globalists don't want you having access to
[3:50:58.360 --> 3:50:59.360]  real healthcare.
[3:50:59.360 --> 3:51:02.240]  We'll be right back, stay with us.
[3:51:02.240 --> 3:51:05.680]  Everyone knows that omega-3 should be an essential part of our daily diet.
[3:51:05.680 --> 3:51:09.680]  With so many different methods of consumption, how do you choose a simple yet effective way
[3:51:09.680 --> 3:51:11.320]  to get your daily intake?
[3:51:11.320 --> 3:51:15.640]  The friendly, knowledgeable folks at North American Nutrition have the answer.

[3:52:06.400 --> 3:52:11.160]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[3:52:11.160 --> 3:52:14.160]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[3:52:14.160 --> 3:52:16.960]  Could their objective be world domination?
[3:52:16.960 --> 3:52:20.120]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[3:52:20.120 --> 3:52:25.120]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[3:52:25.120 --> 3:52:30.480]  80% of humanity is at hand.
[3:52:30.480 --> 3:52:35.920]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.

[3:52:42.480 --> 3:52:45.600]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money, they have all the money they need,
[3:52:45.600 --> 3:52:46.600]  they're after power.

[3:53:59.960 --> 3:54:00.960]  for you.
[3:54:00.960 --> 3:54:08.560]  Okay, I know we've got loaded phone lines, Gunther, Bill, Josh, many others.
[3:54:08.560 --> 3:54:09.560]  I'll have to get to you tomorrow.
[3:54:09.560 --> 3:54:13.520]  I've got some final news I need to hit and then rebroadcast is coming up.
[3:54:13.520 --> 3:54:18.440]  By the way, we do have Professor Griff of Public Enemy on Thursday.
[3:54:18.440 --> 3:54:22.640]  So that is coming up Thursday.
[3:54:22.640 --> 3:54:23.640]  He's on the road right now and listening.
[3:54:23.640 --> 3:54:26.560]  I want to say hi to Professor Griff.
[3:54:26.560 --> 3:54:28.600]  That's going to be interesting.
[3:54:28.600 --> 3:54:31.520]  Any other big hip-hop folks want to call us, come on the show and talk about Obama and
[3:54:31.520 --> 3:54:33.000]  the New World Order.
[3:54:33.000 --> 3:54:37.160]  Just email Aaron at infowars.com, two ways we'd love to have you.
[3:54:37.160 --> 3:54:40.480]  Any other rock and roll folks, Hollywood people, they call out them and call me all the time,
[3:54:40.480 --> 3:54:41.480]  but they're just scared to come on.
[3:54:41.480 --> 3:54:43.480]  They just want to touch base and say they appreciate what we're doing.
[3:54:43.480 --> 3:54:49.000]  But it helps to have a lot of people from every genre on because that just expands it.
[3:54:49.000 --> 3:54:55.880]  Now, worst January on record for stocks, that's out of the Wall Street Journal, GM to use
[3:54:55.880 --> 3:55:01.480]  bailout billion to invest in Brazil, they're going to use the money to build a automaker
[3:55:01.480 --> 3:55:02.480]  in Brazil.
[3:55:02.480 --> 3:55:07.480]  So they're going to use the money to move overseas and I saw another one of the companies
[3:55:07.480 --> 3:55:11.000]  is going to use the money, it was GM too, to move to Mexico.
[3:55:11.000 --> 3:55:13.040]  So we're just paying for them to move.
[3:55:13.040 --> 3:55:18.640]  See, the government's so corrupt, anything they do isn't going to turn to good and it's
[3:55:18.640 --> 3:55:19.640]  a diversion.
[3:55:19.640 --> 3:55:25.080]  50 billion of the automakers, that's nothing or 850 billion for a new stimulus package,
[3:55:25.080 --> 3:55:31.200]  $255,000 per job to create a job, those are going to be government jobs and control freak
[3:55:31.200 --> 3:55:32.960]  jobs and things they control.
[3:55:32.960 --> 3:55:36.280]  We're in trouble, folks, because these people are stealing at all and they, everybody's
[3:55:36.280 --> 3:55:40.320]  scared in the crisis that the bankers created, so they're like, okay, go ahead and do it.
[3:55:40.320 --> 3:55:44.120]  Actually, a lot of folks were against it, the vast majority against the bailout, but
[3:55:44.120 --> 3:55:45.120]  it still happened.
[3:55:45.120 --> 3:55:50.040]  But I wanted to bring Ted Anderson up right here at the end of the show, biggest dead,
[3:55:50.040 --> 3:55:53.880]  we can't count on the government, we know it's going down, gold's shot up way over
[3:55:53.880 --> 3:55:57.240]  900, and I talked to you this morning as I was out of town, you're telling me you're
[3:55:57.240 --> 3:56:04.800]  still offering prices from over a week ago, but the buys you made at gold at the 835 level
[3:56:04.800 --> 3:56:09.280]  or 830 level, that that will be gone soon.
[3:56:09.280 --> 3:56:12.080]  So and then you're going to have to up price, you have to buy more gold.
[3:56:12.080 --> 3:56:15.960]  So people are getting it, you know, the gold, it was $70, $80, $90 less than it is right
[3:56:15.960 --> 3:56:20.320]  now, that priced into the price of this gold when most places don't even have it.
[3:56:20.320 --> 3:56:23.880]  So I wanted to give folks an opportunity to get into something that has real tangible
[3:56:23.880 --> 3:56:26.800]  assets as they're devaluing the dollar.
[3:56:26.800 --> 3:56:29.960]  So specifically, what are the coins you've got, and is this the last time you'll be able
[3:56:29.960 --> 3:56:30.960]  to give this offer?
[3:56:30.960 --> 3:56:37.080]  Right on the target here, and if gold continues to rise, obviously I can't, but I'll hold
[3:56:37.080 --> 3:56:42.480]  it till midnight tonight, but I do have the Frank currently right now at $217, I reprised
[3:56:42.480 --> 3:56:45.120]  them, currently right now they'll be $228.
[3:56:45.120 --> 3:56:52.000]  The British sovereign presently right now is at $265, and in today's market it's $279.
[3:56:52.000 --> 3:56:54.760]  I just completely sold out of the buffaloes.
[3:56:54.760 --> 3:56:58.680]  The silver dimes are still available, but the walking Liberty haves are gone.
[3:56:58.680 --> 3:57:01.760]  The silver dimes are at $1.46.
[3:57:01.760 --> 3:57:06.640]  Plain old silver dollars shot up over $20 apiece, so you can't get those anymore.
[3:57:06.640 --> 3:57:12.280]  That creature from Jekyll Island book, I do put them in there and that's $26.45.
[3:57:12.280 --> 3:57:16.040]  We have a lot of really good deals, Alex, this gold and silver market is going nuts
[3:57:16.040 --> 3:57:17.040]  right now.
[3:57:17.040 --> 3:57:19.640]  A lot of people want to get in, really good news.
[3:57:19.640 --> 3:57:23.400]  People are calling me from the creature from Jekyll Island book, from Sean Hannity and
[3:57:23.400 --> 3:57:25.000]  Rush Limbaugh like crazy.
[3:57:25.000 --> 3:57:30.180]  I was thinking that they want answers, it's really refreshing to know that that is exactly
[3:57:30.180 --> 3:57:33.560]  what they're looking for, and I'm going to give it to them, and I'm going to bring them
[3:57:33.560 --> 3:57:34.560]  over and have them stay.
[3:57:34.560 --> 3:57:42.080]  You're still selling a $25 book for $25 with a silver dollar that's selling for $22 on
[3:57:42.080 --> 3:57:47.560]  the market, and then you're doing the shipping too, so we're talking a $60 plus value for
[3:57:47.560 --> 3:57:48.560]  $26 something?
[3:57:48.560 --> 3:57:49.560]  Yeah, right.
[3:57:49.560 --> 3:57:52.320]  I mean, now that the silver dollars have gone up, it is, it's just poking up there right
[3:57:52.320 --> 3:57:53.320]  around $60.
[3:57:53.320 --> 3:58:00.400]  But that's a loss leader, $800, $686, $2237, $800, $686, $2237.
[3:58:00.400 --> 3:58:06.080]  You have Franks, you have British Sovereigns, you have dimes and silver at the price that
[3:58:06.080 --> 3:58:10.160]  you were giving with, how much is that, how much has the market gone up from that price?
[3:58:10.160 --> 3:58:14.920]  Well, it's gone up about $100, like you say, and the silver obviously not $100, but certainly
[3:58:14.920 --> 3:58:18.400]  if you put a percentage on it, it's about 10% or better.
[3:58:18.400 --> 3:58:22.640]  So things have gone up 10%, you're giving them an offer priced in 10% lower than the
[3:58:22.640 --> 3:58:23.640]  market.
[3:58:23.640 --> 3:58:26.240]  When most places are completely sold out, you're starting to sell out, folks give the
[3:58:26.240 --> 3:58:31.600]  brokers a call, they'll be there until midnight with this deal, $800, $686, $2237, $800, $686,
[3:58:31.600 --> 3:58:32.600]  $2237.
[3:58:32.600 --> 3:58:35.600]  Now, Fran and FM stations, we'll see you back tomorrow.
[3:58:35.600 --> 3:58:39.880]  If everybody else retransmission starts now, one place, infowars.com.
[3:58:39.880 --> 3:58:40.880]  Take care.
[3:58:40.880 --> 3:58:41.880]  Hello, friends.
[3:58:41.880 --> 3:58:42.880]  This is Alex Jones.
[3:58:42.880 --> 3:58:57.160]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more
[3:58:57.160 --> 3:58:58.160]  important than ever.
[3:58:58.160 --> 3:59:01.160]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[3:59:01.160 --> 3:59:03.960]  You'll never have to scan in a bread line or you have your own bread.
[3:59:03.960 --> 3:59:07.960]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[3:59:07.960 --> 3:59:11.880]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[3:59:11.880 --> 3:59:13.520]  the final equation but you.
[3:59:13.520 --> 3:59:17.800]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[3:59:17.800 --> 3:59:21.560]  salmonella genetic alteration, or Chinese imports, and they do it at almost half the
[3:59:21.560 --> 3:59:23.720]  cost of last year's grocery prices.
