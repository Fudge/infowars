[00:57.440 --> 01:05.000]  founding fame who confronted one of the Democratic leaders in the state of New
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.840]  York concerning the fact that 9-11 is an inside job and then should there be a
[01:09.840 --> 01:14.640]  new investigation she said yes and that's made the rounds on Fox and other
[01:14.640 --> 01:18.680]  national news outlets so I thought we talked to Luke Radowski popping in
[01:18.680 --> 01:22.520]  coming up in about 30 minutes then Bob Chapman of the international forecaster
[01:22.520 --> 01:28.160]  to break down what's happening with the economy this week the plunging dollar the
[01:28.160 --> 01:34.000]  exploding price of gold and silver and now other commodities the Chinese
[01:34.000 --> 01:39.520]  laughing at little Timmy Geithner the former New York Fed chairman now the
[01:39.520 --> 01:46.800]  Treasury chairman the Fox literally guarding the henhouse that is coming up
[01:46.800 --> 01:51.800]  and then we have Alan Watt joining us to break down the scientific psychological
[01:51.800 --> 01:59.840]  warfare system that we are living under as well as one of the
[01:59.840 --> 02:06.040]  inventors of a stock exchange system author BBC television host syndicated
[02:06.040 --> 02:14.800]  radio host economist Max Kaiser will be joining us from Paris today so a jam packed
[02:14.800 --> 02:19.080]  Friday transmission we will have open phones with Bob Chapman with Alan Watt
[02:19.080 --> 02:26.560]  and Max Kaiser today and I of course will be going over a large stack of
[02:26.560 --> 02:35.160]  important news as well here on the show this is the type of news I have in
[02:35.160 --> 02:40.160]  front of me this is out of the buffalo news ruling allows taser use to get DNA
[02:40.160 --> 02:47.040]  maybe nations first and we have seen this in many cases of where someone
[02:47.040 --> 02:51.040]  refuses to give a urine sample to the police or to the hospital and they
[02:51.040 --> 02:56.720]  chained them down and then calling the police who in one Florida case tasered
[02:56.720 --> 03:02.160]  the guy nine times and the police chief well that was in Miami defended it said
[03:02.160 --> 03:08.960]  yes this is pain and compliance so we have this big debate about whether
[03:08.960 --> 03:13.920]  waterboarding is torture when it obviously is in the Army's own field
[03:13.920 --> 03:18.600]  manuals or then whether even torture itself is bad
[03:18.600 --> 03:24.120]  meanwhile I've got videos from the 1980s of police in Indiana and in
[03:24.120 --> 03:29.280]  California breaking pro livers arms on purpose and federal judge is saying
[03:29.280 --> 03:37.160]  that's good you sit on a sidewalk at the entrance of a abortion clinic
[03:37.160 --> 03:42.200]  peacefully we're going to break your arms till bloody bones stick out of your
[03:42.200 --> 03:54.600]  flesh and that is a good thing so it's all on record my film martial law we've
[03:54.600 --> 03:58.560]  played that video at person planet dot TV when we simulcast the last two hours
[03:58.560 --> 04:03.720]  the radio show every day and we have all these cases out there now keep
[04:03.720 --> 04:09.800]  explaining to people torture has been going on since at least the 1960s as
[04:09.800 --> 04:17.600]  policy and they call it pain compliance or pressure compliance and so when they
[04:17.600 --> 04:22.640]  say oh we're just torture foreigners baloney I don't know why they don't call
[04:22.640 --> 04:25.760]  it when they rape someone's five-year-old in front of them in Abu Ghraib as
[04:25.760 --> 04:31.000]  the army admits they do part of policy MSNBC AP New Yorker magazine reported on
[04:31.000 --> 04:36.920]  that I don't know why they don't just call it paying compliance you see this
[04:36.920 --> 04:40.880]  is the reality so we'll cover that when we get back Internet radio host held
[04:40.880 --> 04:46.520]  Turner arrested Sean Hannity's good buddy and I believe this is a sigh up and
[04:46.520 --> 04:49.400]  completely staged I'll say that on records you'll get my take on that

[08:46.360 --> 08:52.000]  fourth hours today obviously the big news what everybody's been talking about
[08:52.000 --> 09:01.840]  the last two or three days is that Barack Hussein Obama attacked anybody and
[09:01.840 --> 09:06.360]  had his handlers and surrogates attack anybody that pointed out that his father
[09:06.360 --> 09:12.720]  was a Muslim Marxist kind of an oxymoron that's what he was that his
[09:12.720 --> 09:20.280]  father hailed as an Arab that Obama's really Arab he's a less than 10%
[09:20.280 --> 09:24.480]  African that's on record you can go look at the big news sites doing his
[09:24.480 --> 09:28.160]  genealogy nothing wrong with having an Arab American president let's just be
[09:28.160 --> 09:32.800]  honest about it but see everything with Obama's a hoax so you couldn't talk
[09:32.800 --> 09:39.200]  about how Obama was going to be our first Arab or Muslim president that is
[09:39.200 --> 09:43.400]  brought up Muslim went to Muslim schools then his stepdaddy was a Muslim in
[09:43.400 --> 09:51.800]  Indonesia I mean it goes on and on and on all his daddies are Muslims and I
[09:51.800 --> 09:56.360]  didn't even make a big deal out of that in my film the Obama deception in fact
[09:56.360 --> 10:01.280]  we don't even mention it or get into it we covered the guy is a big foundation
[10:01.280 --> 10:06.200]  run operative a globalist a liar that he lied about not hiring lobbyists that he
[10:06.200 --> 10:12.360]  lied about ending the wars that he lied about ending torture and giving rights
[10:12.360 --> 10:16.440]  detainees I mean he lies about everything we list dozens and dozens and
[10:16.440 --> 10:21.160]  dozens of lies in the film so I didn't touch the big hot button issue of his
[10:21.160 --> 10:25.440]  birth certificate and how they're hiding the original and how they won't show
[10:25.440 --> 10:30.000]  even a copy of the original they show a certificate or his daddy being a Muslim
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.520]  and his stepdaddy being a Muslim and him going by a Muslim name and then
[10:33.520 --> 10:40.200]  changing it and you know how he how his real names Barry I mean this guy is a
[10:40.200 --> 10:46.080]  foundation creation his mama working for Geithner's daddy the Ford Foundation the
[10:46.080 --> 10:51.640]  Rockefeller Foundation being a protege of Kissinger I mean this is bad stuff this
[10:51.640 --> 10:58.520]  is New World Order all the way this is their their Excalibur their their secret
[10:58.520 --> 11:07.320]  weapon after eight years of the bumbling fumbling embarrassing burnout husk of a
[11:07.320 --> 11:16.240]  drug addict George W. Bush this is what they give us and if you talked about the
[11:16.240 --> 11:21.880]  fact that this guy had Muslim roots when this is supposedly an 80% Christian
[11:21.880 --> 11:28.040]  nation I mean that is a big issue and it's interesting I mean if the guy's
[11:28.040 --> 11:32.280]  really been a Muslim in his life whatever he is today that is big important
[11:32.280 --> 11:39.360]  news that he went to Muslim madrasas and schools and that there's all these
[11:39.360 --> 11:43.000]  scores of pictures of him in Muslim dress and that these reports of him
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.240]  saying he was a Muslim the fact that they said you couldn't talk about that
[11:48.240 --> 11:51.920]  and it was a conspiracy theory kind of like they used to say the CFR didn't
[11:51.920 --> 11:58.680]  exist and it was a conspiracy theory and that now it's big news and then he's
[11:58.680 --> 12:06.320]  giving speeches in Cairo saying yeah my Muslim roots you see that's a bait and
[12:06.320 --> 12:17.200]  switch that's another deception from this guy you know I got a call from
[12:17.200 --> 12:21.400]  psychology today which is a big magazine I'd say every psychologist in the
[12:21.400 --> 12:28.120]  country reads it the new priest guild out pushing that all Americans be drug
[12:28.120 --> 12:33.160]  basically and that all behavior is neurotic and malfunctioning and then
[12:33.160 --> 12:39.840]  only they can give you salvation when they on average are a group of complete
[12:39.840 --> 12:51.560]  nutcases one of the most suicidal groups of any profession one of the most
[12:51.560 --> 12:57.320]  neurotic groups one of the most medicated groups in fact psychologists and
[12:57.320 --> 13:03.440]  psychiatrists of the number one profession for people being committed but
[13:03.440 --> 13:11.000]  I digress and I had to sit there and say to the guy does the Bilderberg group
[13:11.000 --> 13:18.200]  exist does the CFR exist and he would hesitate and wasn't sure and it was the
[13:18.200 --> 13:23.440]  same thing mr. Jones do you believe that they pulled the fire alarm at the
[13:23.440 --> 13:28.160]  Bilderberg group meeting to flush you out mr. Jones I was like well do you
[13:28.160 --> 13:31.000]  believe they were following me do you believe Secret Service was there and I
[13:31.000 --> 13:35.720]  it was noncommittal I mean this is the level I have to have the newspapers over
[13:35.720 --> 13:44.160]  the years say I'm crazy Bilderberg doesn't exist bohemian Grove doesn't
[13:44.160 --> 13:48.600]  exist I mean you are the ones that are living in a false reality you are the
[13:48.600 --> 13:55.520]  ones that are living in La La Land you know we come out and say well his daddy
[13:55.520 --> 13:59.640]  was a Muslim and his stepdaddy was a Muslim he went to Muslim schools they
[13:59.640 --> 14:07.040]  go shut up lying racist anti-Muslims it's a crazy conspiracy theories these
[14:07.040 --> 14:18.920]  people are insane over and over and over again and that's what they do you know
[14:18.920 --> 14:24.000]  they set up the European Union by treaty in 1957 Treaty of Rome that's all now
[14:24.000 --> 14:33.280]  declassified in public all over the British and European news and in 2007
[14:33.280 --> 14:40.040]  they had the 50th anniversary of the European Union celebrating the Treaty
[14:40.040 --> 14:47.960]  of Rome now up until the late 1990s they said the European Union did not exist and
[14:47.960 --> 14:54.280]  it was a conspiracy theory when European peoples in France and Germany and
[14:54.280 --> 14:58.080]  Denmark and Holland and the Netherlands and France you know everywhere and the
[14:58.080 --> 15:03.840]  15 member group at first now it's over 20 they would say well the European
[15:03.840 --> 15:07.320]  Economic Community it's acting as an unelected group that's usurping
[15:07.320 --> 15:12.400]  sovereignty and wants to grow to our currencies and they would say oh your
[15:12.400 --> 15:20.000]  conspiracy theorist I remember those articles in 96 97 98 99 and then after
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.520]  they got it publicly set up in 2000 and remove the sovereignty of the nations
[15:24.520 --> 15:27.720]  entirely and set up their tyranny they want you know we're gonna have parades
[15:27.720 --> 15:33.160]  in every European Union nation in 2007 and we're gonna celebrate 50 years of
[15:33.160 --> 15:41.640]  our Union now I still get emails saying the European Union doesn't exist because
[15:41.640 --> 15:44.720]  some people are still following the old script folks the European Union does
[15:44.720 --> 15:48.480]  exist the Council on Farm Relations does exist I don't care of Limbaugh for
[15:48.480 --> 15:53.480]  decades said it didn't exist he said for the first 15 years of a syndicated
[15:53.480 --> 15:57.240]  show that it didn't exist and not the last four or five he says yeah it exists
[15:57.240 --> 16:04.600]  but it's no big deal see I'm not the crazy person I don't care what psychology
[16:04.600 --> 16:09.360]  today rides or what their cover story is yes ladies and gentlemen they're coming
[16:09.360 --> 16:13.400]  after me and see they'll probably I know they're listening you know tuning into
[16:13.400 --> 16:16.800]  the show I guess they'll put that in there and Mr. Jones is schizophrenic
[16:16.800 --> 16:21.560]  paranoid schizophrenic he believes we're listening well you called up you said
[16:21.560 --> 16:25.960]  you're listening see but if that doesn't matter if you talk about the NSA wire
[16:25.960 --> 16:31.480]  tapping the country warrantlessly oh you're a schizophrenic
[16:34.160 --> 16:39.080]  see how this word oh you believe a European Union type of North American
[16:39.080 --> 16:45.520]  Union agreement was signed March 24th 2005 at Baylor University in a secret
[16:45.520 --> 16:50.920]  ceremony with the Sente Fox George HW Bush and the prime minister of Canada
[16:50.920 --> 16:56.840]  Paul Martin well yes well judicial watch sued and got the documents and it's all
[16:56.840 --> 16:59.320]  about how they got to keep it here from the public they just say we don't care
[16:59.320 --> 17:04.360]  doesn't exist you're crazy and you say to the media but they really did meet and
[17:04.360 --> 17:08.560]  signed that they say we don't care we're gonna tell the yuppies you're crazy and
[17:08.560 --> 17:11.840]  yuppies only care about acting like they're cool and going along with the
[17:11.840 --> 17:16.240]  mainstream so they so if we tell them it doesn't exist they will say it doesn't
[17:16.240 --> 17:26.840]  exist Obama's daddy wasn't a Muslim his stepdaddy wasn't a Muslim though he was
[17:26.840 --> 17:38.880]  publicly it's the same thing Obama has had over a dozen bills and it is that
[17:38.880 --> 17:42.120]  we've read the bills on air at nauseam to allow the attorney general about any
[17:42.120 --> 17:46.160]  guns he wants by executive fiat total tyranny to ban anybody who's on the
[17:46.160 --> 17:49.720]  no-fly list over a million 100,000 people from being able to fly no due
[17:49.720 --> 17:56.440]  process no judge no jury you're just on it do not let veterans on firearms giving
[17:56.440 --> 18:00.760]  them all psychological designations and it's already happening bills to ban
[18:00.760 --> 18:05.640]  everything down to black powder bills to ban manufacturer importation and then
[18:05.640 --> 18:09.600]  when we talk about it they send democratic operatives out on TV to say
[18:09.600 --> 18:13.880]  there's no gun bills that exist it's all a conspiracy theory the people are
[18:13.880 --> 18:18.440]  crazy the people are crazy Obama give speeches to stop going out buying guns
[18:18.440 --> 18:22.000]  I don't want your guns I only want reasonable gun control which means total
[18:22.000 --> 18:25.360]  ban you know he argued for that as a state senator he argued for that as a
[18:25.360 --> 18:29.080]  US senator he argued for his chief of staff argued for it in books and in
[18:29.080 --> 18:32.760]  legislation when he was a congressman Rahm Emanuel his attorney general was the
[18:32.760 --> 18:36.880]  government lawyer arguing for a complete gun ban in the DC versus Heller case last
[18:36.880 --> 18:42.960]  year all on record and what do they say you're crazy it doesn't exist but you
[18:42.960 --> 18:49.000]  know what everybody knows you're a pack of liars playing a psychological trick
[18:52.240 --> 18:55.800]  and people are going and finding out there is an North American Union we're
[18:55.800 --> 18:59.400]  already in and they're finding out you have introduced all these gun ban bells
[18:59.400 --> 19:05.040]  and they're finding out that all of this tyranny is taking place and they're
[19:05.040 --> 19:09.400]  finding out that you're lying about all of it and so you just keep losing more
[19:09.400 --> 19:16.840]  and more and more and more credibility I remember 13 years ago they were having
[19:16.840 --> 19:20.440]  up open public meetings announcing Napa superhighways they were gonna build all
[19:20.440 --> 19:24.000]  over the country and how great it was gonna be and I went on there and covered
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.440]  it and the public didn't like it and so they said no so the media went back and
[19:28.440 --> 19:32.000]  said okay it doesn't exist you're crazy if you talk about it then they sort of
[19:32.000 --> 19:35.280]  building all the roads and setting them up and saying okay they do exist but
[19:35.280 --> 19:39.080]  they're good then people complained so they said okay they don't exist I remember
[19:39.080 --> 19:42.680]  seeing in a year and a half ago saying North American trans-Texas highways
[19:42.680 --> 19:48.680]  NAFTA highways don't exist on television laughing at Ron Paul while they're
[19:48.680 --> 19:52.880]  building up with the billboards up saying now they say they canceled it again
[19:52.880 --> 19:57.360]  but that they're continuing to build them see they play psychological games

[25:34.920 --> 25:38.200]  Stiglitz that have worked for him Nobel Prize winner at the IMF World Bank
[25:38.200 --> 25:43.800]  John Perkins economic hitman all of them on record how they do this operation and
[25:43.800 --> 25:48.520]  now they're not just using England Europe United States as an engine to fund
[25:48.520 --> 25:53.840]  their operation and to supply their diplomatic corps that carry this out
[25:53.840 --> 25:58.440]  they are now destroying the west and destroying the middle class to integrate
[25:58.440 --> 26:02.800]  us into a giant third-world slave mass known as the New World Order and this is
[26:02.800 --> 26:08.720]  all stated by them they're lowering the standard of the west to keep the standard
[26:08.720 --> 26:11.880]  of the third-world low they're not going to raise the third world they're going
[26:11.880 --> 26:16.240]  to lower the first and second and old and bring it all into one technological

[26:33.360 --> 26:39.320]  their rates their value how much currency there is how much credit there is what
[26:39.320 --> 26:44.760]  the interest rates are this has all been stated hundreds and hundreds and
[26:44.760 --> 26:48.920]  hundreds of news articles and I'm sitting there talking to this pretty
[26:48.920 --> 26:52.640]  well-known psychologist that writes for psychology today an author who's writing
[26:52.640 --> 27:01.160]  this big story basically about me and I'm saying to him you know there's a new
[27:01.160 --> 27:03.520]  world order you know they've announced new bank of the world we're gonna pay
[27:03.520 --> 27:08.280]  our taxes to him and he was kind of like huh really tell me about it I said wait
[27:08.280 --> 27:12.360]  do you acknowledge that literally every week there's hundreds of articles have
[27:12.360 --> 27:16.520]  you not seen any of them Time Magazine Newsweek Financial Times he was like oh
[27:16.520 --> 27:19.840]  tell me about are they coming after us are they are they going to get us you
[27:19.840 --> 27:23.080]  know like oh you're oh they're coming to get you in the night oh you're a
[27:23.080 --> 27:26.240]  schizophrenic you know basically the attitude I'm like no here's the
[27:26.240 --> 27:29.080]  headlines Financial Times of London published by a
[27:29.080 --> 27:33.120]  Bilderberg Group member and now for global government and then it goes on to
[27:33.120 --> 27:37.400]  say yes it's real yes we kept it secret yes it's tyrannical for your own good
[27:37.400 --> 27:41.560]  they say it's authoritarian for your own good and I'm sitting there going don't
[27:41.560 --> 27:45.680]  you understand this isn't five years ago where you're following the old script
[27:45.680 --> 27:49.560]  that it doesn't exist and then you as a psychologist buy into that as the
[27:49.560 --> 28:02.200]  orthodoxy the orthodoxy of the Aztecs the orthodoxy of the Aztecs was that it
[28:02.200 --> 28:06.640]  was normal to cut out thousands of people's hearts every year into murder
[28:06.640 --> 28:10.960]  thousands and thousands of men women children that was normal and if you were
[28:10.960 --> 28:16.760]  against doing that you were insane so see to the guy at psychology today I'm
[28:16.760 --> 28:22.400]  like a conquistador or something showing up and seeing the Aztecs doing human
[28:22.400 --> 28:28.600]  sacrifices I think they're crazy but the establishments the Aztecs of today they
[28:28.600 --> 28:34.000]  think it's completely normal see we are crazy those of us that don't want world
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.400]  government don't want world tyranny and don't want the entire population on
[28:37.400 --> 28:43.280]  Ritalin and Prozac drugs we're crazy just like we would be crazy in the Aztec
[28:43.280 --> 28:50.600]  kingdom and we weren't for human sacrifice they think we're nuts and so
[28:50.600 --> 28:56.720]  you're talking to them saying I believe there's a world government and it's oh
[28:56.720 --> 29:03.440]  you you believe in that and tell me about more of your delusions they're out
[29:03.440 --> 29:11.800]  to get you and I'm like it's in the newspaper a bank of the world will pay
[29:11.800 --> 29:16.800]  carbon taxes you know we'd read club of Rome CFR trilateral Commission documents
[29:16.800 --> 29:21.200]  a decade ago and people wouldn't go look them up and find out they were real they
[29:21.200 --> 29:27.600]  would just say we were liars and we and Schizophrenics now it's openly being
[29:27.600 --> 29:33.320]  announced and we're still crazy of word against it just like we're crazy if we
[29:33.320 --> 29:39.480]  say Obama's daddy was a Muslim until he says his daddy was a Muslim and he's
[29:39.480 --> 29:45.000]  basically a Muslim in his roots then it's oh yes he's Muslim in his roots it
[29:45.000 --> 29:49.400]  exists there but still doesn't exist when we say it in criticism that's mine

[33:36.640 --> 33:41.440]  live I didn't want to carry it tape five days a week in fact I forgot to
[33:41.440 --> 33:46.240]  announce today because the days of the show they're taping to air Saturday
[33:46.240 --> 33:55.080]  evenings I need to I've got it in my email the station number on XM and
[33:55.080 --> 33:59.280]  Sirius that we're going to be on I need to need to announce that we just get so
[33:59.280 --> 34:03.760]  busy here with the news and information we forget but I will plug that by the
[34:03.760 --> 34:06.720]  middle of the next hour very thankful that that is happening because the
[34:06.720 --> 34:10.360]  information we cover is becoming so mainstream I mean all these years they
[34:10.360 --> 34:13.880]  said world government didn't exist all these years they said we were crazy
[34:13.880 --> 34:18.080]  exactly what we said was going to be done has now been announced a bank of the
[34:18.080 --> 34:22.080]  world that you will pay your carbon taxes to that is coming up as we break
[34:22.080 --> 34:26.600]  down what's happening with GM being imploded by design many mainline
[34:26.600 --> 34:30.760]  economists are agreeing with what we've said that they're destroying it by
[34:30.760 --> 34:35.960]  design to hack it up and give it to Russia China and of course Brazil that
[34:35.960 --> 34:40.760]  is where different divisions of GM are being sold off to this is just
[34:40.760 --> 34:48.080]  absolutely horrible and they're using the money because did you know that under
[34:48.080 --> 34:53.240]  the World Trade Organization treaty agreements that they can't take
[34:53.240 --> 34:58.360]  stimulus money or bailout money and only give it to US companies or to spend
[34:58.360 --> 35:04.440]  it inside the United States they have to per capita depending on how much GDP
[35:04.440 --> 35:08.760]  there is in different nations give pieces of it in negotiations to other
[35:08.760 --> 35:16.320]  countries and so you notice that World Trade Organization member countries are
[35:16.320 --> 35:21.640]  all getting pieces of it Russia China Brazil they're all have very powerful
[35:21.640 --> 35:28.640]  chairs at the table as permanent members of the World Trade Organization board
[35:28.640 --> 35:33.000]  all nations don't get to join so see that's the global corporate it's
[35:33.000 --> 35:37.240]  corporate private government's signed a contract a treaty with them we can
[35:37.240 --> 35:41.640]  always get out of the treaty but they won't because Congress is sold out to
[35:41.640 --> 35:46.000]  where that's something people aren't pointing out that of the 787 million
[35:46.000 --> 35:51.840]  dollar stimulus package a lot of that money most estimates are about half
[35:51.840 --> 35:55.480]  we're not sure yet because the White House had promised that's another lie to
[35:55.480 --> 35:58.960]  make every dollar accountable and where it was being spent now they won't tell
[35:58.960 --> 36:05.680]  anybody where it's going they just say oh a lot of it's going to build GM
[36:05.680 --> 36:17.280]  and plants in China and Brazil and Russia the 787 billion and now the 30
[36:17.280 --> 36:24.680]  billion to GM is going to fund moving it this is an AP in Bloomberg they admit
[36:24.680 --> 36:29.760]  the money's going to move it to those countries to move whole divisions of GM
[36:29.760 --> 36:35.520]  to those countries China isn't really paying for Hummer they're being given
[36:35.520 --> 36:40.960]  the money to do it and 108 billion dollars is being given on top of the
[36:40.960 --> 36:43.760]  hundreds of billions that have already been given to the IMF and World Bank of
[36:43.760 --> 36:47.600]  our taxpayer money we got to pay not just the money but interest on to the
[36:47.600 --> 36:54.200]  bankers so they can then give it to India and Russia and China and other
[36:54.200 --> 37:00.920]  nations I mean that's globalism a private World Trade Organization board
[37:00.920 --> 37:07.280]  who come up with a screw job like that we pay to have GM put into bankruptcy and
[37:07.280 --> 37:12.560]  see GM wouldn't go along with it so Obama said I'm going to fire the CEO he
[37:12.560 --> 37:15.680]  doesn't step down we're going to destroy you in the media the White House chief
[37:15.680 --> 37:25.600]  of staff comes out and says think about the magnitude of that then they take it
[37:25.600 --> 37:30.720]  over and they bust it up in pieces and they hand it over to foreign nations
[37:30.720 --> 37:34.800]  that's all part of globalization that's why they've had tax incentives for 20
[37:34.800 --> 37:39.200]  years to move offshore the federal government wants you to not have jobs
[37:39.200 --> 37:42.920]  they want you to be dependent on them they admit it in their own white papers
[37:42.920 --> 37:49.080]  you understand how dastardly this is they want you dependent in every nation
[37:49.080 --> 37:52.640]  whether it's Poland or Russia or the United States it's all about divide and
[37:52.640 --> 37:56.920]  conquer where all the assets are in private offshore corporate hands not in
[37:56.920 --> 38:04.080]  the nation they use your tax money to line their pockets but the details are
[38:04.080 --> 38:10.480]  all secret because Obama is a congenital degenerate liar all right I got to stop
[38:10.480 --> 38:14.560]  there folks we got Luke Radowski coming up here in just a moment made big

[41:01.600 --> 41:04.800]  others so for folks that don't know who you are briefly tell us about we are
[41:04.800 --> 41:08.640]  change we are changing the activist grassroots organization that started two
[41:08.640 --> 41:12.560]  years ago we never expected it to grow but other people love the idea they
[41:12.560 --> 41:15.680]  carried it in their cities and towns and now we have over a hundred chapters
[41:15.680 --> 41:19.120]  worldwide of people just being the change that they want to see in the world
[41:19.120 --> 41:23.080]  following Gandhi's principles following what the Luther King's principles were
[41:23.080 --> 41:25.880]  out there raising money for first responders were feeding the homeless
[41:25.880 --> 41:29.920]  were confronting politicians on their lives were out there every day we are
[41:29.920 --> 41:33.440]  changing on fire the last couple days we confronted Richard Haas with we are
[41:33.440 --> 41:37.240]  changing San Francisco we are changing LA they also confronted the black pope we
[41:37.240 --> 41:41.600]  are changing Chicago Ohio talk confronted row UK confronted the head of
[41:41.600 --> 41:45.080]  the economist on bill the birds and here in New York we confronted senator
[41:45.080 --> 41:48.040]  Gillembrand Russell Simmons and governor Patterson within the last couple
[41:48.040 --> 41:54.480]  days okay for those that don't know what two years ago Luke radowski inspired by
[41:54.480 --> 41:59.720]  road to tyranny and researching 911 truth started we are change and for
[41:59.720 --> 42:03.680]  those that email me and call me it's not a centralized group it's people just
[42:03.680 --> 42:08.960]  starting we are change chapters and you know investigating the new world order
[42:08.960 --> 42:13.120]  exposing government sponsored terrorism that's why you'll see different views
[42:13.120 --> 42:18.520]  from different groups and that's why it's such an effective leaderless
[42:18.520 --> 42:22.240]  resistance is that it's individual leaders starting groups taking action
[42:22.240 --> 42:27.520]  some cities have multiple groups many states have four or five groups very very
[42:27.520 --> 42:31.200]  effective and they were again doing this long before Obama had his slogan of
[42:31.200 --> 42:34.840]  change we believe he picked it up ripped it off from we are change and many of his
[42:34.840 --> 42:39.520]  tactics from Ron Paul they admit they ripped off Ron Paul's tactics and
[42:39.520 --> 42:45.440]  campaigning grassroots and Obama ripping off the we are change idea but people
[42:45.440 --> 42:52.560]  accuse us of ripping that off from Obama no we got it from Gandhi saying be the
[42:52.560 --> 42:58.360]  change want to see in the world that idea of nonviolent action and then of
[42:58.360 --> 43:03.040]  course the Obama picked up on that but the issue here is that the media doesn't
[43:03.040 --> 43:05.880]  ask real questions so you guys go to press conferences you go to meetings
[43:05.880 --> 43:09.720]  you're the citizen media your videos get millions of views in the aggregate we
[43:09.720 --> 43:13.680]  made the film truth rising covering what we are change 911 truth are doing and
[43:13.680 --> 43:19.120]  you're pioneering the type of gonzo citizen journalism that I really trail
[43:19.120 --> 43:26.080]  blazed unknowingly in the mid-19 and late 1990s confronting George Bush and
[43:26.080 --> 43:31.480]  Attorney General Janet Reno and countless others and it gets attention it ends up
[43:31.480 --> 43:34.960]  in the AP it ends up on national news because real questions are being asked
[43:34.960 --> 43:39.880]  and it's it's it's it's really got the establishment worried they put out CFR
[43:39.880 --> 43:43.040]  white papers worried about it Bilderberg groups been worried about it this is
[43:43.040 --> 43:46.720]  confirmed they've a national countless national shows attacking we are change
[43:46.720 --> 43:50.640]  saying that quote we're dangerous of the people asking questions need to be
[43:50.640 --> 43:55.560]  tased or sent to quote camps that's all covered in truth rising Luke tell us
[43:55.560 --> 43:59.480]  about this latest confrontation with the senator that got a lot of attention
[43:59.480 --> 44:02.320]  run through some of the other confrontations that video with senator
[44:02.320 --> 44:05.840]  Gumbel and definitely did get a lot of attention I had Manny Padillo and not
[44:05.840 --> 44:09.280]  11 victims family member very professionally in a suit and a
[44:09.280 --> 44:13.000]  microphone with a big camera go up to senator Gillibrand and talk about the
[44:13.000 --> 44:17.120]  scientific peer-reviewed paper of explosives being found at the world
[44:17.120 --> 44:20.760]  trade center we talked to her about that the seventy percent of questions of
[44:20.760 --> 44:24.120]  victims family members that were never answered we told that the senator
[44:24.120 --> 44:27.520]  Gillibrand and with hearing that information she said she would back
[44:27.520 --> 44:32.840]  full hearing into not 11 and in response to that we get flandered by Fox News in
[44:32.840 --> 44:37.000]  the New York observer who are calling us hecklers and that Gillibrand didn't know
[44:37.000 --> 44:41.080]  she was talking to a conspiracy theorist we have that's because they are scared
[44:41.080 --> 44:45.040]  of a new investigation they want to sweep it under the rug just like torture
[44:45.040 --> 44:51.280]  exactly we were professional we had a victim family member talk to a senator
[44:51.280 --> 44:56.120]  we had scientific peer-reviewed papers and work conspiracy theory I mean that
[44:56.120 --> 44:59.520]  does not make any sense at all that's right you politely confronted her with
[44:59.520 --> 45:03.760]  the facts as a journalist should do exactly and she reacted to those facts
[45:03.760 --> 45:08.280]  very well and she said she would back a full show did Biden when we are changed
[45:08.280 --> 45:13.840]  what was it L.A. or San Diego no need to change L.A. yeah yeah they talked to
[45:13.840 --> 45:17.920]  Biden we played that clip here it's up at we are change.org and we are change
[45:17.920 --> 45:22.560]  L.A. and you know they brought him the peer-reviewed study and he was really
[45:22.560 --> 45:27.000]  freaked out he definitely was and and again Biden has a lot to cover up we
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.680]  we confronted him and he admitted he had four now it's not 11 known that
[45:30.680 --> 45:35.520]  Muhammad Med had of the Pakistani ISI was fine and Muhammad out of he said he
[45:35.520 --> 45:38.680]  knew that before not 11 and told him not to do it to me on camera
[45:38.680 --> 45:43.360]  during his presidential debate back about a year and a half ago I mean it is
[45:43.360 --> 45:48.120]  just insane that this man is now vice president we actually confronted Richard
[45:48.120 --> 45:52.680]  Holbrook on the issue about the Pakistani ISI supporting Muhammad out of
[45:52.680 --> 45:57.360]  before not 11 Holbrook said oh you got to ask Dick Cheney that and then he turned
[45:57.360 --> 46:01.240]  off the mic when Sabrina Rivera asked him the question no Mr. Holbrook you got
[46:01.240 --> 46:05.400]  to ask your own vice president Joe Biden about the ISI connections he
[46:05.400 --> 46:09.520]  knows a lot more about that than Dick Cheney since meeting with Muhammad Med
[46:09.520 --> 46:14.000]  days before not 11 so it's just ridiculous that's right that video clip that you
[46:14.000 --> 46:19.560]  another shot when you brought it up to him and really shook him up from one of
[46:19.560 --> 46:24.200]  the Democratic presidential debates that is in the film truth rising that
[46:24.200 --> 46:28.600]  everybody has got to see it's a testament to citizen journalism and the
[46:28.600 --> 46:33.480]  power of taking action and trying to get firefighters and police medical
[46:33.480 --> 46:38.680]  coverage when major university medical centers admit that they are dying from
[46:38.680 --> 46:42.800]  the dust by the thousands how do you get thanked well a lot of police thank you
[46:42.800 --> 46:47.120]  and hug you but others try to plant bombs on you and that's all on video as
[46:47.120 --> 46:50.920]  well and they still harass me I went to an event two weeks ago with Larry
[46:50.920 --> 46:55.840]  Cerverstein and Ed Koch and Dan Rather we confronted Larry Cerverstein we
[46:55.840 --> 47:00.160]  confronted Ed Koch and as I'm leaving the event at a coke check I have NYPD
[47:00.160 --> 47:03.840]  intelligence come up to me Bloomberg's own security staff in Bloomberg wasn't
[47:03.840 --> 47:07.080]  even anywhere near there two weeks ago and they're like Luke Luke Luke you
[47:07.080 --> 47:09.720]  can't be doing this you got to get out of here give me your idea I'm like no
[47:09.720 --> 47:13.760]  and I'm like how do you know my name and the police intelligence officer told me
[47:13.760 --> 47:17.880]  he's just as good as I am and I was like what do you mean and they tried to set me
[47:17.880 --> 47:21.800]  up again they wouldn't let me leave the venue two weeks ago I was literally
[47:21.800 --> 47:26.080]  playing tug-of-war at the exit door with police and they have these public
[47:26.080 --> 47:30.520]  press conferences you show up they tell you leave and they hold you and go and
[47:30.520 --> 47:35.120]  then this is on record on video with witnesses and they they grab Luke and
[47:35.120 --> 47:38.360]  say you are not allowed to leave but we're gonna arrest you if you don't
[47:38.360 --> 47:41.240]  leave hey that's what they did with the Bloomberg thing when they arrested me
[47:41.240 --> 47:44.920]  two weeks ago they tried it again I had to literally argue with police
[47:44.920 --> 47:48.800]  intelligence for 10 minutes I'm playing a tug-of-war trying to get out of there
[47:48.800 --> 47:52.280]  they're telling me I can't leave regular police officers came were holding the
[47:52.280 --> 47:55.880]  door at the other end they were holding the door at me until a third police
[47:55.880 --> 47:59.440]  intelligence officer came said no he's good he's been here he's been registered
[47:59.440 --> 48:03.480]  for a week at this event he's really pressed please let him go and the
[48:03.480 --> 48:07.520]  police intelligence officers had to argue in front of me arguing if they should
[48:07.520 --> 48:11.120]  let me go or not and then the one police intelligence officer opened up the
[48:11.120 --> 48:14.920]  secondary says Luke I'm sorry for this sorry for the rest of me just just you
[48:14.920 --> 48:20.120]  know just get out of here I'll be fired probably but the point is is that you
[48:20.120 --> 48:24.640]  go to press events you get registered you just ask questions exactly and then
[48:24.640 --> 48:28.800]  and then they cops walk up and say your camera's a gun your backpacks a bomb I
[48:28.800 --> 48:33.720]  know it isn't we're gonna rescue for terrorism and now video video and now
[48:33.720 --> 48:37.080]  they're lying with the Bloomberg arrest case they're saying that a custodian was
[48:37.080 --> 48:40.760]  talking and asking me to leave during my Bloomberg arrest case when I never even
[48:40.760 --> 48:44.720]  talked to a custodian all I talked with NYPD intelligence and Bloomberg's own
[48:44.720 --> 48:48.040]  personal security staff when I was arrested there they have their own
[48:48.040 --> 48:51.840]  disposition they wrote you know in papers prosecuting me saying that a
[48:51.840 --> 48:55.600]  custodian was asking me to leave and I didn't want to leave I mean that is
[48:55.600 --> 48:59.640]  utter bullcrap because anytime I'm asked to leave I leave automatically and
[48:59.640 --> 49:03.520]  they're saying I was talking to a custodian I never even once talked to a
[49:03.520 --> 49:08.600]  custodian I was told to stay by NYPD intelligence because I was detained and
[49:08.600 --> 49:12.720]  by doing that they arrested me that means the central bookings for two days and
[49:12.720 --> 49:16.640]  now I got to go through this criminal criminal arrest case and my next case
[49:16.640 --> 49:21.360]  is actually on my birthday which I also share with my lawyer and it's just
[49:21.360 --> 49:24.920]  sick and disgusting what's going on in this country in the land of the free home
[49:24.920 --> 49:27.800]  of the brave that our veterans supposedly fought and died for freedom of the
[49:27.800 --> 49:34.280]  press we now have army colonels on Fox News saying we need to start killing
[49:34.280 --> 49:40.120]  American journalist in America that criticize the war on terror I mean these
[49:40.120 --> 49:44.400]  people are out of their minds they sure are and then when you have family members
[49:44.400 --> 49:47.800]  then when you have scientific papers they still call you conspiracy theorist
[49:47.800 --> 49:52.080]  there's no there's no theory about it we have scientific papers we have victim
[49:52.080 --> 49:55.120]  family members going up to senators and they're called they're going to call
[49:55.120 --> 49:59.200]  senator Gillin brand gullible they're going to go on Fox News and try to
[49:59.200 --> 50:03.920]  slander us as hecklers no we were very professional you look at that video we
[50:03.920 --> 50:07.200]  were very professional in the way we handle ourselves and then we get this
[50:07.200 --> 50:11.720]  treatment I mean what's happening to this country is this thick and disgusting
[50:11.720 --> 50:16.360]  knowing that we have to go through all this hassle and harassment when we're

[54:51.480 --> 54:56.520]  opposite group everybody else knows there's a North American Union everybody
[54:56.520 --> 55:00.680]  else knows Obama's daddies were all Muslims when he said they weren't now
[55:00.680 --> 55:04.440]  they admit it not that that's you know itself a bad thing it's that he lies
[55:04.440 --> 55:10.080]  about it everybody knows in the world that Obama said he would make all the
[55:10.080 --> 55:14.760]  bell-out money public and now he says it's secret everybody knows he wouldn't
[55:14.760 --> 55:17.880]  you know said he wouldn't hire lobbyists that's all he's done everybody heard
[55:17.880 --> 55:22.280]  him say he didn't Iraq immediately they didn't went to 16 months than 21 months
[55:22.280 --> 55:29.000]  whether you're for the war or not the guys a liar that's the same thing with
[55:29.000 --> 55:36.740]  the Arabs he'll go over there and give them hope and give them an olive
[55:36.740 --> 55:40.120]  branch when they reach out the olive branch he's gonna pull that hand back
[55:40.120 --> 55:43.360]  and jab a dagger right in their heart that's what he does with his false hope
[55:43.360 --> 55:50.120]  he's a con man working for even bigger con men let's go back to Luke Radowski
[55:50.120 --> 55:53.320]  look go through some of these other confrontations then I want to play this
[55:53.320 --> 55:56.320]  audio coming up the next segment go through some of the people that we are
[55:56.320 --> 56:00.640]  changing is just going after with with real questions I mean recently we just
[56:00.640 --> 56:04.080]  talked to a New York governor governor Patterson me and Manny Padilla we did
[56:04.080 --> 56:07.360]  the same thing with senator Gillin brand Manny Padilla was there as a victims
[56:07.360 --> 56:11.160]  family member and we talked to send to the governor about not 11 first
[56:11.160 --> 56:14.920]  responders and he actually told us that there was plutonium in the atmosphere
[56:14.920 --> 56:19.440]  and it at ground zero itself we were very surprised to hear that problem and
[56:19.440 --> 56:24.440]  that's peer reviewed British journals and NASA journals from the time and they
[56:24.440 --> 56:29.480]  didn't say they don't know why there was plutonium go ahead yeah and then we
[56:29.480 --> 56:33.880]  brought up the case for a new investigation and and everything else
[56:33.880 --> 56:36.880]  that happened and we're out there we're out there every week we're out there
[56:36.880 --> 56:39.720]  ground zero given our free formation talking to people we're interviewing
[56:39.720 --> 56:43.400]  people in the street we ask people if they know anything about the NBA playoffs
[56:43.400 --> 56:46.040]  and they know everything and then we have people they know what the second
[56:46.040 --> 56:49.680]  amendment is and even soldiers that we interviewed don't know what the second
[56:49.680 --> 56:54.600]  amendment is I mean it's sad where where where this country is going where people
[56:54.600 --> 56:58.200]  know more about NBA playoffs than they do about the second amendment and about
[56:58.200 --> 57:02.160]  about a bill of rights for God's sake but we're always out there it is great
[57:02.160 --> 57:06.560]  seeing internationally we are changed and all throughout this country confront
[57:06.560 --> 57:11.480]  criminals everywhere they go whether Chicago Ohio San Francisco LA even all
[57:11.480 --> 57:15.000]  the way to UK people are taking action and they're sick of this and it's not
[57:15.000 --> 57:18.680]  about one person it's not about one group it's about an idea and it's about
[57:18.680 --> 57:22.600]  going out there doing what you want doing what you feel is right and that's
[57:22.600 --> 57:28.520]  exactly what we are changes about you're absolutely right and and now more than
[57:28.520 --> 57:31.800]  ever we need people to be out there taking action they've got a new bill
[57:31.800 --> 57:38.760]  introduced for national compulsory service HR 1444 it says for elementary
[57:38.760 --> 57:43.720]  middle school high school college baby boomers senior core it says everyone
[57:43.720 --> 57:47.720]  will have compulsory national service to the government later I'm going to read
[57:47.720 --> 57:50.400]  this in the next hour
[57:50.800 --> 57:57.360]  national compulsory service I mean it says that in the first line Luke yeah and
[57:57.360 --> 58:00.840]  then we talk about it and the media says it doesn't exist doesn't exist I
[58:00.840 --> 58:04.640]  think they're playing a dangerous game here Luke of denying any of this stuff's
[58:04.640 --> 58:07.720]  going on exactly and then when it's really gonna happen people are gonna
[58:07.720 --> 58:11.040]  wake up and we're talking to a lot of Obama supporters in the streets and we're
[58:11.040 --> 58:14.360]  bringing up the fact we're bringing up his lies and you see people's mind
[58:14.360 --> 58:18.160]  change in the interview that we're doing with them at Times Square at ground
[58:18.160 --> 58:22.160]  zero and it's a beautiful thing it's also sick knowing that Obama is going to
[58:22.160 --> 58:26.400]  use 9-eleven as a way to push his compulsory service and we need to take
[58:26.400 --> 58:29.480]  9-eleven back we're gonna be in the streets of New York on September 10th

[1:00:13.280 --> 1:00:23.280]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[1:00:29.600 --> 1:00:33.960]  talking with Luke Kredowski right now Bob Chapman coming up let's play some of
[1:00:33.960 --> 1:00:37.640]  senator Gillibrand being questioned by Luke Kredowski and others that we are
[1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:48.320]  changed out or here it is so happy to be from GCN we'd like to just ask you
[1:00:48.320 --> 1:00:54.440]  before you speaking of you know speaking up about those who don't have a voice
[1:00:54.440 --> 1:00:59.120]  we have a very urgent situation right now in New York City before there was a
[1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:03.160]  question asked about Afghanistan about seven and a half years being there close
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:09.720]  to eight years ago I lost my loved one in the World Trade Center Thomas Joseph
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:14.800]  scroy the mentor of our family okay 70% of family members questions were never
[1:01:14.800 --> 1:01:19.720]  answered during the Commission hearings just recently Vice President Biden was
[1:01:19.720 --> 1:01:25.840]  handed a paper a study that was done that proves that their explosives found in
[1:01:25.840 --> 1:01:33.280]  the debris of the World Trade Center I'm asking you how you feel given the fact
[1:01:33.280 --> 1:01:37.040]  that family members first responders scientists and even your colleagues feel
[1:01:37.040 --> 1:01:41.080]  that there should be a new and open investigation into what happened in New
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:46.080]  York City on 9-11 do you support a new investigation to what happened well
[1:01:46.080 --> 1:01:50.280]  based on what you just told me and that 70% of the families questions weren't
[1:01:50.280 --> 1:01:54.280]  answered I think those questions should be answered so if that means another
[1:01:54.280 --> 1:01:59.080]  review or a fuller hearing or more opportunities the families I will
[1:01:59.080 --> 1:02:03.120]  support that because I do think it's important that every family member has
[1:02:03.120 --> 1:02:07.520]  every question answered would you would your office accept the study and to be
[1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:10.480]  able to take a look at it and review I will certainly look at the study and
[1:02:10.480 --> 1:02:14.640]  review it absolutely and also there's the James to Droga bill that's on the
[1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:18.880]  Senate floor right now it's supporting the tens of thousands of sick and dying
[1:02:18.880 --> 1:02:23.600]  hero first responders that went into my uncle I'm carrying that bill and I'm
[1:02:23.600 --> 1:02:28.200]  carrying it from senator Clinton secretary Clinton and I'm working with
[1:02:28.200 --> 1:02:32.360]  congressman Carolyn Maloney on the house side okay so so there's Manny
[1:02:32.360 --> 1:02:38.200]  Badea who lost his uncle mr. Scroy we all we cover all that and truth rising
[1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:43.560]  the DVD film and there he is credibly bringing up bills bill numbers she's
[1:02:43.560 --> 1:02:47.920]  carrying the bill we've been fighting for years to get first responders health
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:53.080]  care of dying cops firemen begging and then the current cops come and arrest you
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:02:58.680]  I mean literally folks and they laugh it's very and then other cops will get
[1:02:58.680 --> 1:03:03.400]  mad at them those that are informed and little arguments will break out but
[1:03:03.400 --> 1:03:06.920]  this is mental illness ladies and gentlemen the media called this
[1:03:06.920 --> 1:03:10.800]  conspiracy theorist they call this heckling Fox News we could play that
[1:03:10.800 --> 1:03:16.200]  clip was that heckling right there Luke Radowski to come up and to have GC and
[1:03:16.200 --> 1:03:19.520]  press passes I forgot to make that point that you guys get into a lot of these
[1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:24.120]  events and Ted Anderson's agreed to that a year ago and Ted's had even had had to
[1:03:24.120 --> 1:03:27.000]  have meetings with the Secret Service that's right the owner of Genesis
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:30.520]  Communications has had the Secret Service show but he has to have meetings
[1:03:30.520 --> 1:03:35.680]  with them and explain yes we are change is freelance reporters for us and they
[1:03:35.680 --> 1:03:39.680]  and they've asked Ted under pressure to say that he didn't give you press passes
[1:03:39.680 --> 1:03:44.520]  and others so you could be arrested I forgot about that angle and then when
[1:03:44.520 --> 1:03:47.560]  I'm talking to psychology today yesterday telling them about this stuff
[1:03:47.560 --> 1:03:51.600]  they're acting like I'm making it up that we get Secret Service and FBI
[1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:56.260]  visits here at this office Luke I mean it is insane they've got to bring so much
[1:03:56.260 --> 1:04:00.000]  pressure on us when we're just doing a job that journalists all throughout the
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:03.280]  country should be doing we're doing the job that the media is not doing we're
[1:04:03.280 --> 1:04:06.680]  there for the American people for the American public we don't have any core
[1:04:06.680 --> 1:04:10.120]  responses we don't have any big money or big government back in us and the
[1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:14.080]  government is is going after us and we're gonna be out there no matter what
[1:04:14.080 --> 1:04:17.400]  and that's why we need everybody to rise up it's not about one person it's not
[1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:20.440]  about one group we need everybody to come together rise up and become
[1:04:20.440 --> 1:04:24.320]  journalists become citizens aware citizens that are going to take action
[1:04:24.320 --> 1:04:28.280]  in this political process that we're going through right now we all need to
[1:04:28.280 --> 1:04:32.960]  get involved before it's too late well you're right look Redalsky come back

[1:04:58.080 --> 1:05:04.200]  separate many human illnesses can be attributed to the fact that soil in the

[1:08:26.640 --> 1:08:30.640]  big public event like Bill Clinton or somebody and they bring up 9-11 he says
[1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:35.760]  9-11 inside job how dare you with the same fake conviction of him saying I
[1:08:35.760 --> 1:08:43.640]  did not have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky but what they do now when we are
[1:08:43.640 --> 1:08:47.280]  change gets in his legitimate media and ask very good questions they just come
[1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:50.680]  out and lie and say that it was heckling or that their conspiracy theorist for
[1:08:50.680 --> 1:08:55.560]  bringing up a real bill that's very close to passing to get health care for the
[1:08:55.560 --> 1:08:59.760]  firemen and police and medical emergency workers from 9-11 pretty soon
[1:08:59.760 --> 1:09:05.040]  they'll say 9-11 doesn't exist but then it does exist if they're pushing it for
[1:09:05.040 --> 1:09:09.680]  national service day that if you don't serve a national compulsory service well
[1:09:09.680 --> 1:09:13.760]  then you're with al-qaeda and you helped attack America on 9-11 that's the
[1:09:13.760 --> 1:09:21.320]  psychology that mr. Barack Obama is pushing Luke plug any of the events and
[1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:27.000]  things that are coming up and I mentioned pardon me loose gone I told him to
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:30.720]  hold over nobody told me that it's a three-ring circus around here well
[1:09:30.720 --> 1:09:35.120]  whatever I told him to stay there doesn't matter you can find out more we
[1:09:35.120 --> 1:09:45.400]  are change.org classic okay now there's a lot going on in the economy right
[1:09:45.400 --> 1:09:52.680]  now obviously that's a ridiculous statement because it's so obvious but I
[1:09:52.680 --> 1:10:00.200]  want to go over unemployment hits records but job losses slow well because
[1:10:00.200 --> 1:10:05.280]  there's not many more jobs to be lost I guess it's not 650,000 a month like it's
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:11.240]  been every month they only cut 345,000 jobs the problem is they manipulate the
[1:10:11.240 --> 1:10:17.480]  unemployment numbers we'll talk about that with the man who's run the biggest
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:21.400]  economic newsletter in the world at one time then he retired came back now one
[1:10:21.400 --> 1:10:25.200]  of the biggest again Bob Chapman the international forecaster you've heard
[1:10:25.200 --> 1:10:29.000]  him and seen him all over international television and syndicated radio his
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:33.440]  website is international forecaster.com we carry his stuff at info wars.com
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:37.960]  and prisonplanet.com and he is a regular contributor here every Friday want to
[1:10:37.960 --> 1:10:42.640]  talk to me about that the hijacking of GM I remember two years ago two and a
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:46.000]  half years ago Bob on this show put out a newsletter saying they were going to
[1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:52.720]  bankrupt the next few years GM and send it to China and Brazil they have done
[1:10:52.720 --> 1:10:57.200]  that now but they're also going to send some to Russia I want to get his take on
[1:10:57.200 --> 1:11:02.880]  that I want to just go over the whole spectrum of what's really going on in
[1:11:02.880 --> 1:11:09.320]  the economy Geithner being laughed at when he was over in China Paul Craig
[1:11:09.320 --> 1:11:15.200]  Roberts calm about that today that's carried at info wars.com Bob Chapman
[1:11:15.200 --> 1:11:19.680]  good to have you here with us well thank you it's wonderful to be here again
[1:11:19.680 --> 1:11:25.760]  absolutely it is wonderful to have you here again it's not on good circumstances
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:29.960]  though I I wish you were being proven wrong I wish I was being proven wrong I
[1:11:29.960 --> 1:11:34.040]  wish Ron Paul was Dr. Paul Craig Roberts who's coming on next week along with Ron
[1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:38.920]  Paul I wish that we weren't so right I wish people would have listened to us
[1:11:38.920 --> 1:11:45.960]  decades ago but break down the latest info Bob Chapman well we just got our
[1:11:45.960 --> 1:11:49.040]  unemployment today and as you said it wasn't as bad as they thought it was
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:54.520]  going to be but it's 9.8% on the short term now that doesn't include the
[1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:59.240]  marginally attached workers people have been looking for
[1:11:59.240 --> 1:12:05.800]  work for the past year but have stopped searching and those who are out of work
[1:12:05.800 --> 1:12:12.080]  because they don't have any child care they are poor health they can't get
[1:12:12.080 --> 1:12:18.520]  the work because they don't have a car that brings it up to 10.6% and then we
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:22.720]  have the involuntary part-time work is in other words instead of working 40
[1:12:22.720 --> 1:12:26.600]  hours a week I don't have enough work for you so they let you work 33 hours a
[1:12:26.600 --> 1:12:31.240]  week and that includes these people and then all the people who were discouraged
[1:12:31.240 --> 1:12:37.720]  and if you add into that the people who have not continued to collect unemployment
[1:12:37.720 --> 1:12:45.480]  checks because their ability to collect them is over they've
[1:12:45.480 --> 1:12:51.480]  reached the limit and that the government says and it's called U6 and
[1:12:51.480 --> 1:12:57.960]  I've got these figures and tomorrow's issue is 16.4% and they're using the
[1:12:57.960 --> 1:13:02.840]  birth-death ratio now when I won't go into that all it is is that they guess
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:08.960]  and how many jobs were created during the last monthly period at small and
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:14.000]  medium-sized businesses now if you don't use that and you use the formula from
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:23.160]  1980 that figure is 20.2% unemployed and that's really the real figure they
[1:13:23.160 --> 1:13:26.680]  cook the statistics and Congress even admits this and there's been big
[1:13:26.680 --> 1:13:33.760]  arguments and squabbles over it let's get into GM how did you call it I'm
[1:13:33.760 --> 1:13:38.120]  gonna give you one more statistic and they're talking about six million
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:45.160]  unemployed just recently and if you add in that 4.9 million unemployed you've
[1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:50.280]  got 10.9 million unemployed since the beginning of the year if you use the
[1:13:50.280 --> 1:13:59.600]  U6 figure that's amazing what a drag on the economy staggering Bob I want to
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:03.320]  get back into that and what that's gonna mean in the short term in the mid
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:08.360]  term in the long term but General Motors and I've been reading the forecaster I
[1:14:08.360 --> 1:14:11.880]  haven't seen you toot your horn I remember two and a half years ago you
[1:14:11.880 --> 1:14:16.800]  saying GM was gonna go bankrupt and they'd move it to China and to Brazil
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:20.840]  you were you were one of my sources on that then the last year and a half I
[1:14:20.840 --> 1:14:26.120]  saw rumblings in the industry of that and I tried to warn people and then now
[1:14:26.120 --> 1:14:31.000]  it's happened Hummer and other divisions go to China other large divisions of
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:36.560]  GM being sold off to Brazil Opel being sold off to a Russian-controlled
[1:14:36.560 --> 1:14:42.160]  government bank all of this happening and the average American has no idea that
[1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:49.560]  the 30 billion bailout for GM that's already unpopular isn't to keep it here
[1:14:49.560 --> 1:14:54.280]  but to hack up most of it and move it offshore and then produce some of these
[1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:59.680]  toasters on wheels these little four-wheeled you know tinker toys to
[1:14:59.680 --> 1:15:03.920]  force us to own those with the government dictating what's manufactured
[1:15:03.920 --> 1:15:08.960]  and the GM the big story on top of that GM wouldn't go along with it and so they
[1:15:08.960 --> 1:15:15.040]  ordered the emperor ordered the CEO to fall on his sword just like it was in
[1:15:15.040 --> 1:15:19.720]  the Associated Press David Rockefeller last year Rex Tillerson at ExxonMobil
[1:15:19.720 --> 1:15:23.080]  wouldn't say global warming was real and called for a global carbon tax so they
[1:15:23.080 --> 1:15:26.880]  went and threatened to fire the whole board and fire him Rockefeller exercised
[1:15:26.880 --> 1:15:31.720]  all his secret stock and that he runs that whole thing and they say he came on
[1:15:31.720 --> 1:15:37.160]  said okay it's real I support global tax I mean this is really happening they
[1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:41.280]  are completely dismantling things so go through those three points a how did you
[1:15:41.280 --> 1:15:44.080]  know that was going to happen then you're ever you broke it it did come out
[1:15:44.080 --> 1:15:47.880]  mainstream news and now you're in after that it's now documented and it's now
[1:15:47.880 --> 1:15:56.920]  come to past that's a B why are the globalist destroying our entire society
[1:15:56.920 --> 1:16:03.480]  well first of all I started writing about the dismantling of the manufacturing
[1:16:03.480 --> 1:16:11.760]  capability of the United States economy in 1967 in 1980 I wrote about Ford and
[1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:19.280]  and General Motors setting up plants in Mexico India and China and I said it was
[1:16:19.280 --> 1:16:25.880]  being deliberately done as part of a plan to ship all manufacturing cold to
[1:16:25.880 --> 1:16:31.960]  the third world at that time and that is exactly what's happened and as you say
[1:16:31.960 --> 1:16:39.880]  they're hyping off the best parts and at the same time they're putting probably
[1:16:39.880 --> 1:16:45.280]  between 40 and 60,000 people directly in General Motors out of a job never
[1:16:45.280 --> 1:16:50.600]  remind all the peripheral jobs now there's some really good facts on this
[1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:58.480]  thing that have been coming to light first of all GEM GM workers are losing
[1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:04.480]  their retirement health benefits their jobs their life savings and the shareholders
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:13.600]  get nothing now JP Morgan Chase and Citibank had loan money to GGM they're
[1:17:13.600 --> 1:17:21.040]  getting back six billion dollars one hundred percent of what they loaned
[1:17:21.040 --> 1:17:24.560]  nobody else is getting that the bondholders are getting screwed as well
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:29.720]  and let's explain that Obama goes to the unions only he could get away with a
[1:17:29.720 --> 1:17:33.880]  Republican couldn't and says give up your benefits give up your pensions large
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:38.400]  portions of it give up your hours and maybe we'll save a little something and
[1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:45.440]  then meanwhile they're shipping the entire system overseas and then financing
[1:17:45.440 --> 1:17:51.600]  it with the bailout money go ahead it is illegal for them to do what they are
[1:17:51.600 --> 1:18:00.080]  intending to do with the retirement plans of the employees in 1974
[1:18:00.080 --> 1:18:08.000]  URISO was passed the employee employee retirement income security act that
[1:18:08.000 --> 1:18:14.400]  says you cannot seize workers pension funds whether monthly payments or health
[1:18:14.400 --> 1:18:19.280]  insurance anymore that you can see is their private bank accounts now they
[1:18:19.280 --> 1:18:24.920]  have directly and deliberately from the White House violated the law that you
[1:18:24.920 --> 1:18:31.160]  haven't seen the end of this thing yet and the law is extremely specific
[1:18:31.160 --> 1:18:37.720]  explicit and so there's going to be all kinds of thunder and lightning and of
[1:18:37.720 --> 1:18:43.440]  course there's going to be real problems stemming from JP Morgan Chase and
[1:18:43.440 --> 1:18:47.480]  Citibank well Bob stop stop stop because I'm gonna put this in where we're gonna
[1:18:47.480 --> 1:18:51.280]  break and I want you to answer it right now and when we come back explain to
[1:18:51.280 --> 1:18:56.440]  people there's the way I read it there says they're saying they're taking the
[1:18:56.440 --> 1:19:01.200]  general fund that is the pensions and the investments from the pensions and
[1:19:01.200 --> 1:19:07.120]  putting that under general stock that they're gonna float out there and that
[1:19:07.120 --> 1:19:13.040]  is expropriating and stealing the investment pensions isn't it that's
[1:19:13.040 --> 1:19:23.920]  right that is probably 17% and what my my suspicion is that the management may
[1:19:23.920 --> 1:19:31.160]  have looted the money or part of the money from that plan sure we don't know
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:35.960]  yet it's being looked into we're trying to find out that won't they won't tell
[1:19:35.960 --> 1:19:39.200]  us anything yeah the bear may have crapped in the woods we're gonna you
[1:19:39.200 --> 1:19:44.640]  know sharks may fish you know they may have stolen portions of it or all of it
[1:19:44.640 --> 1:19:49.200]  just like the Pentagon has stolen four plus trillion in the last ten years
[1:19:49.200 --> 1:19:53.960]  that's associated press out of the Pentagon pension funds they've stolen
[1:19:53.960 --> 1:19:57.760]  everything it's offshore Northcom standing by to make sure they get away
[1:19:57.760 --> 1:20:03.880]  with stealing everything stay there Bob Chapman life change T detoxifies get the

[1:24:01.400 --> 1:24:19.320]  if we remember back in 2003 Bush haunch showed a bill under was big news they
[1:24:19.320 --> 1:24:22.760]  were saying was gonna protect pension funds but the bill allowed them to
[1:24:22.760 --> 1:24:28.400]  invest pension funds in the markets and if you really read it it said they
[1:24:28.400 --> 1:24:33.320]  could take pensions but then Bob saying that the older law isn't superseded by
[1:24:33.320 --> 1:24:37.120]  that Bob I don't want to miss the forest for the trees because you're bringing
[1:24:37.120 --> 1:24:40.520]  up such incredibly important stuff I don't even know of our listeners of the
[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:43.960]  general public or a lot of new listeners we have on several new stations this
[1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:50.600]  week and XM picking us up realize what we're saying this is absolute looting and
[1:24:50.600 --> 1:24:55.240]  highway robbery and they're being so secretive about all these banks brokerage
[1:24:55.240 --> 1:25:00.840]  firms Chrysler GM Obama swore every dime would be accounted now he's saying
[1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:06.040]  national security none of it will be accounted I mean they're going for
[1:25:06.040 --> 1:25:09.840]  broke here Bob how bad are they gonna just steal and steal and steal till
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:15.640]  everything collapses yes that's their intention because they want everything to
[1:25:15.640 --> 1:25:20.280]  collapse and that's the only way worldwide they can get people to be forced
[1:25:20.280 --> 1:25:24.880]  into world government the acceptance thereof and you know I wrote about this
[1:25:24.880 --> 1:25:30.840]  in 1967 nobody was listening I thought I was crazy and I could see the I try to
[1:25:30.840 --> 1:25:35.840]  figure out how can I get people to accept this and that's a theory that I came
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:41.520]  up with the disembowelment of industry in the United States Canada and Western
[1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:49.600]  Europe and a depression and forcing the public to accept you know the question at
[1:25:49.600 --> 1:25:56.320]  General Motors is their hyping offer spinning off the plants in China Mexico
[1:25:56.320 --> 1:26:03.760]  India and other places that is GM those are the profitable parts that's right
[1:26:03.760 --> 1:26:10.520]  and who paid for that we did it so how how can they do that legally they can't
[1:26:10.520 --> 1:26:19.300]  and then the pension funds you know that the management says that as of last
[1:26:19.300 --> 1:26:25.000]  year that they were hold I can hardly believe that because for the past 22
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:31.480]  months the stock market is down 35% and it was down as much as 50% at one point
[1:26:31.480 --> 1:26:37.440]  about two and a half months ago so those pensions that pay up plans and like
[1:26:37.440 --> 1:26:46.280]  everybody else's have to be offside or short not having enough money probably
[1:26:46.280 --> 1:26:54.120]  40% maybe 35 maybe 50 and so they're lying I mean those funds can't be but
[1:26:54.120 --> 1:26:58.080]  they're gonna steal them anyway and they're gonna give them stock so if you
[1:26:58.080 --> 1:27:03.480]  want to go have your pancreas removed you give the doctor GM stock of course
[1:27:03.480 --> 1:27:11.200]  he's not gonna take it it's unbelievable Bob I was out of town last
[1:27:11.200 --> 1:27:16.360]  Friday but I was listening to the show you you were kind of making your
[1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:20.840]  prognosis worse than it's been in the past can can you break down what the
[1:27:20.840 --> 1:27:26.200]  cards to you show in the short mid and long term I mean are things deteriorating
[1:27:26.200 --> 1:27:39.480]  now faster I think so but they still be able to extend it and what I mean by
[1:27:39.480 --> 1:27:48.200]  that is I expect the dollar to go down and it's around 79 or so on the USDX
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:57.040]  right now down from a 89.5 and which is a recent top I expected to go to 71 by
[1:27:57.040 --> 1:28:02.680]  the fall and what's going to I think happen is what happened between a
[1:28:02.680 --> 1:28:10.600]  November of 07 and June of 08 and that is other countries businesses are gonna
[1:28:10.600 --> 1:28:17.600]  again only even more so stop accepting dollars and that's gonna cause a crisis
[1:28:17.600 --> 1:28:23.360]  now I think it's gonna be much worse this time than last time and if the
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:29.760]  dollar is not down to 71 18 and again it's around 75 or 80 right now if it's
[1:28:29.760 --> 1:28:34.920]  not down the it'll get there and if it's down there it will go lower and so I
[1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:41.760]  think this next two to four months is a very critical time for the book dollar
[1:28:41.760 --> 1:28:45.680]  and they can't hold it out now explain this basic equation to people that don't
[1:28:45.680 --> 1:28:50.200]  understand it I mean in layman terms we're gonna see massive commodity price
[1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:56.160]  increases if they start devaluing the dollar like we saw a year ago with you
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:29:00.920]  know gas for four and a half dollars at the pump $150 a barrel oil can you
[1:29:00.920 --> 1:29:04.920]  explain that relationship but even a lot of mainstream economists I listened to
[1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:09.760]  CNBC on XM for four hours driving to the beach last weekend and they it sound
[1:29:09.760 --> 1:29:14.720]  like Bob Chapman was doing the shows they were actually admitting that this
[1:29:14.720 --> 1:29:19.080]  is probably the last time they're gonna be able to hold off total destruction of
[1:29:19.080 --> 1:29:29.680]  the economy by pumping up the the different things like well exactly the
[1:29:29.680 --> 1:29:33.120]  stimulus going in and pumping up commodities stay there we're gonna
[1:29:33.120 --> 1:29:36.480]  come back and talk about that this was a short segment long segment coming up
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:39.760]  plenty of time for Bob Chapman to break this down and I'm gonna open the phones
[1:29:39.760 --> 1:29:43.920]  up for questions for Bob Chapman only for Bob Chapman on the economy folks

[1:33:53.240 --> 1:33:56.800]  Watt very informative about the psychological makeup of the social
[1:33:56.800 --> 1:34:01.480]  engineers the world they're building the society they're setting up he can
[1:34:01.480 --> 1:34:06.480]  interpret very accurately from that perspective why the elites are doing what
[1:34:06.480 --> 1:34:10.760]  they're doing how it all fits into a larger narrative and the matrix like
[1:34:10.760 --> 1:34:14.720]  false reality they've got us in and then economist and winner of the very
[1:34:14.720 --> 1:34:20.360]  popular stock market system BBC TV hosts syndicated radio host on and on and on
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:25.160]  Max Kaiser I guess who produces his TV show
[1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:36.880]  Alec Baldwin of Team America fame that'll always be Alec Baldwin's claim to fame as Team America but
[1:34:36.880 --> 1:34:44.520]  Alec Baldwin you've been very useful for me oh it's blacks oh no so a little bit of
[1:34:44.520 --> 1:34:53.080]  fun here Max Kaiser is coming up okay going back to Bob Chapman Bob's okay
[1:34:53.080 --> 1:34:55.880]  I've been interrupting a lot throwing in important questions but nevertheless I
[1:34:55.880 --> 1:35:01.320]  am fully informed on this always learning more but I'm fully informed on the
[1:35:01.320 --> 1:35:05.840]  basics I know they're doing it by design I've read the IMF World Bank documents
[1:35:05.840 --> 1:35:09.880]  Club of Rome documents CFR documents Bilderberg infiltrators they're on
[1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:14.440]  record Joseph's sticklets has come out saying he was there and they're setting
[1:35:14.440 --> 1:35:19.280]  it up John Perkins work for him and the CIA and has gone public and then on the
[1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:24.320]  other side we've got we talked about a few weeks ago we have George Soros
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:27.760]  running around at a press conference saying I'm having a great crisis I
[1:35:27.760 --> 1:35:31.320]  helped engineer it this is the culmination of my life I mean this
[1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:36.720]  bastard is openly dancing on our grave very very arrogantly and I can't get the
[1:35:36.720 --> 1:35:41.640]  average yuppie to admit how bad it is or that the Republicans and Democrats have
[1:35:41.640 --> 1:35:45.760]  sold them down the river as world government is openly being announced in
[1:35:45.760 --> 1:35:49.600]  hundreds of newspapers and magazines like Time Magazine telling us that it's the
[1:35:49.600 --> 1:35:54.160]  solution to all our problems I mean it's all coming to a head now keep
[1:35:54.160 --> 1:35:59.120]  breaking down what you see happening with the economy and how you see this
[1:35:59.120 --> 1:36:02.920]  unfolding and just all the latest on metals and other commodities and that
[1:36:02.920 --> 1:36:10.200]  question I was asking before the break first is what do you see commodities
[1:36:10.200 --> 1:36:13.680]  doing this summer into the fall and winter what do you see happening with
[1:36:13.680 --> 1:36:19.320]  the dollar why were the Chinese laughing at Geithner well first of all I see
[1:36:19.320 --> 1:36:25.160]  commodities higher as they go along but not especially so they had quite a run
[1:36:25.160 --> 1:36:31.240]  back and and I think that they'll they'll probably make another game like
[1:36:31.240 --> 1:36:38.960]  let's take copper as an example it moved from 135 to 228 the other 229 the other
[1:36:38.960 --> 1:36:44.960]  day that that's quite a move and I would I expected to retrench at 180 90 but it
[1:36:44.960 --> 1:36:49.720]  didn't do so it just kept on going so we could get some more mileage out of that
[1:36:49.720 --> 1:36:54.920]  but not a lot and I think the same is true of oil you know it could go to 80
[1:36:54.920 --> 1:37:00.200]  dollars and a short of a war that should be it where we're trading around 69
[1:37:00.200 --> 1:37:06.800]  right now so it's neutral to positive as far as gold and silver the day before
[1:37:06.800 --> 1:37:13.480]  yesterday they took all down 18 dollars in silver down 60 cents yesterday they
[1:37:13.480 --> 1:37:20.600]  were up 17 dollars and 57 cents respectively today the government
[1:37:20.600 --> 1:37:25.200]  attacked again in their manipulation and at one time today gold was down 28
[1:37:25.200 --> 1:37:32.120]  dollars and right now it's down 1960 and silver has recovered somewhat it's down
[1:37:32.120 --> 1:37:36.760]  about 50 yeah what does it mean when we see that Pogo stick you know up 20 dollars
[1:37:36.760 --> 1:37:40.760]  down 20 dollars up 20 dollars in the last week explain to new listeners out
[1:37:40.760 --> 1:37:47.200]  there how they manipulate well under the executive order signed by Ronald Reagan
[1:37:47.200 --> 1:37:53.520]  in August of 1988 and I have the number here if you want it they are supposed to
[1:37:53.520 --> 1:37:58.000]  come into the markets and smooth them during times of crisis well that's not
[1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:03.080]  what they're doing they distorted the executive order and 24 7 all over the
[1:38:03.080 --> 1:38:08.040]  world they manipulate markets who does it the Fed reserve the Treasury they
[1:38:08.040 --> 1:38:11.280]  are really the main component and they've been caught insider trading they do
[1:38:11.280 --> 1:38:15.280]  this for select brokerage firms and banks profits the plunge protection team
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:21.600]  or what the president's open market committee on markets and that's why
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:27.960]  Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase any group make these phenomenal profits because
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:31.560]  they know ahead of time what's going on either out of the Treasury or out of the
[1:38:31.560 --> 1:38:37.120]  Fed and as all of you should know the Federal Reserve is no more federal and
[1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:42.480]  federal Express the Federal Reserve is a private organization and so these people
[1:38:42.480 --> 1:38:47.520]  have been raping us since 1913 and we want to stop it and that's why Ron Paul
[1:38:47.520 --> 1:38:52.360]  put in his bill 1207 which is a hundred ninety seven hundred and seventy nine
[1:38:52.360 --> 1:38:56.400]  sponsors a good way to stop them but that's what they've been doing and they
[1:38:56.400 --> 1:39:00.600]  do it all the time they manipulate they're doing legally doing it legally
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:06.360]  let's change that let's stop them from doing that let's have a free market and
[1:39:06.360 --> 1:39:10.480]  we can accomplish that if we can get some of these bills passed and Ron's
[1:39:10.480 --> 1:39:17.160]  1207 is one of those I think we need a legislation for tariff tariffs on
[1:39:17.160 --> 1:39:21.400]  goods and services if we don't we're never going to stop all of this
[1:39:21.400 --> 1:39:26.200]  offshoring and outsourcing and they're going to continue to kill us in Europe to
[1:39:26.200 --> 1:39:31.800]  that's right this country was built on free trade and fair trade not rig
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:36.080]  trade and was built on tariffs instead of taxing the American people I want to
[1:39:36.080 --> 1:39:41.200]  give you the good news Bob this is just out from Ron Paul's office HR 1207 now
[1:39:41.200 --> 1:39:48.440]  up to 190 cosponsors they get another 30 or 40 yeah for those that don't know
[1:39:48.440 --> 1:39:53.360]  well we got it passed yeah yeah to 12 we got it passed and for those that don't
[1:39:53.360 --> 1:39:58.840]  know the private Federal Reserve brags on TV now so they would always deny that
[1:39:58.840 --> 1:40:02.800]  they were private and say they were federal until they got exposed now
[1:40:02.800 --> 1:40:06.480]  they've been oh yeah we're private we're secret nobody can audit us nobody can
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:11.080]  look at us we're above the law Greenspan goes on Lair News hour Bernanke says it
[1:40:11.080 --> 1:40:16.000]  before Congress we've got those clips in my film the Obama deception and now it's
[1:40:16.000 --> 1:40:19.840]  gaining four or five sponsors a week in this session at that rate in a couple
[1:40:19.840 --> 1:40:24.920]  weeks three weeks we're going to have enough votes here in three and a half
[1:40:24.920 --> 1:40:29.440]  four weeks to audit this criminal organization that's never been audited
[1:40:29.440 --> 1:40:33.240]  and all these people couldn't believe that we could get to this point or they
[1:40:33.240 --> 1:40:37.440]  can't believe we could beat the Fed they think it's invincible well even if we
[1:40:37.440 --> 1:40:41.440]  lose this time it points out that this thing is private and has never been
[1:40:41.440 --> 1:40:45.720]  audited and that it's the alien it's the criminal it's the cancer Bob
[1:40:45.720 --> 1:40:50.600]  Chabin well you're absolutely right and this is what I've been fighting for and
[1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:57.480]  I haven't been working directly with Ron Paul I just decided on my own to get on
[1:40:57.480 --> 1:41:03.720]  the the other networks and and really lay this out to the people we've had a
[1:41:03.720 --> 1:41:08.080]  tremendous response and obviously my asking them and of course Ron's group
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:15.560]  pushing as well has brought us a hundred and ninety co-sponses so it's very
[1:41:15.560 --> 1:41:24.000]  exciting and there was legislation that just went through in in in conversation
[1:41:24.000 --> 1:41:32.040]  to be sent to committee about auditing and exposing the Fed and I have all of
[1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:37.880]  the information in tomorrow's issue it covers an amendment adopted by the
[1:41:37.880 --> 1:41:45.800]  oversight committee in the house which is sponsored by Dennis Kasinich and I
[1:41:45.800 --> 1:41:51.160]  get I just got a pile of stuff on tomorrow's issue on these issues that
[1:41:51.160 --> 1:41:56.960]  we're talking about right now and it looks to me like we can get it passed in
[1:41:56.960 --> 1:42:03.720]  the Senate and if we don't it's gonna cost the Fed reserve probably 50 or a
[1:42:03.720 --> 1:42:07.160]  hundred billion dollars to stop it because that's that's what these senators
[1:42:07.160 --> 1:42:14.720]  are gonna want to get paid off now imagine the elite the wealth moved out
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:18.080]  years ago out of the US they openly brag how they're collapsing it's by design
[1:42:18.080 --> 1:42:22.760]  but a lot of these house members and senators and a new vorice are figuring
[1:42:22.760 --> 1:42:26.680]  out that they're killing the goose that lays the golden eggs on the altar of
[1:42:26.680 --> 1:42:31.640]  globalism the US and Europe have to fall into economic implosion for the
[1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:36.960]  social engineers the mega rich the ultra elite to have a world monopoly of
[1:42:36.960 --> 1:42:41.040]  power and control in their own words and so I think one of the biggest wild
[1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:47.120]  cards what could turn into the due sex here is that the new vorice are
[1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:50.640]  starting to figure out they're not the pet puppies they're not the specially
[1:42:50.640 --> 1:42:55.840]  protected class they thought they were and are beginning to not like this new
[1:42:55.840 --> 1:43:00.200]  world order I think that's why we're seeing more and more of CNBC and Fox and
[1:43:00.200 --> 1:43:04.360]  and and people even coming out and telling some of the truth because all
[1:43:04.360 --> 1:43:08.080]  this is out in the open now and a lot of people in the system are figuring out
[1:43:08.080 --> 1:43:12.680]  that they're not going to be protected Bob Chapman they are expendable and I
[1:43:12.680 --> 1:43:17.280]  can promise you that and if they keep on doing what they're doing they're going
[1:43:17.280 --> 1:43:21.840]  to have a meeting with a guy called ropes appear and you know when I'm on all
[1:43:21.840 --> 1:43:28.480]  of these Fox and ABC and NBC these short programs I get on every one of the
[1:43:28.480 --> 1:43:32.240]  hosts know what's going on but they're afraid to talk about they feel that Bob
[1:43:32.240 --> 1:43:38.440]  do it I mean you know he he's invincible he doesn't care he's 73 he's lived his
[1:43:38.440 --> 1:43:44.360]  life let him challenge him I'm not going to lose my job because of it well Ron
[1:43:44.360 --> 1:43:50.680]  Paul in Congress for the last 16 years or so was previously in for one term in
[1:43:50.680 --> 1:43:55.760]  the 70s they got back into the 90s been 90s for those that want to know that
[1:43:55.760 --> 1:44:01.640]  trivia he would get four or five sponsors in years past maybe 15 20 now
[1:44:01.640 --> 1:44:05.600]  it's a hundred and ninety and all these negative people email me saying oh it's
[1:44:05.600 --> 1:44:10.640]  staged they plan to implode the Fed and set up something worse no this is real
[1:44:10.640 --> 1:44:15.080]  and the Fed does not like the fact that there's a call for it to be audited and
[1:44:15.080 --> 1:44:19.720]  the mainstream media has a complete shutdown on this news and information
[1:44:19.720 --> 1:44:24.560]  they are scared to death the private New York branch of the Fed is partners with
[1:44:24.560 --> 1:44:29.720]  the Bank of England it is an offshore alien group to this country it is the
[1:44:29.720 --> 1:44:32.320]  group that's been trying to take over this nation ever since we kicked the
[1:44:32.320 --> 1:44:40.640]  crown out in 1783 84 and it is anathema to this free society and yes we can
[1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:44.560]  beat the greatest empire in the world the British at the time we can beat the
[1:44:44.560 --> 1:44:48.480]  private New World War banking empire but this fake Christian foregone
[1:44:48.480 --> 1:44:53.320]  conclusion that this is the end of the world that's taught by the 501c3
[1:44:53.320 --> 1:44:57.080]  government churches that lay down that you can't fight evil that you're not
[1:44:57.080 --> 1:45:02.080]  supposed to is a lie even if we can't fight this and that it's and that it's
[1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:06.440]  foretold gonna happen we have a moral responsibility to fight evil and it is
[1:45:06.440 --> 1:45:12.720]  of the devil period that that that people are following this fake doctrine of
[1:45:12.720 --> 1:45:17.240]  laying down to this and sucking your thumbs and saying that we can't fight
[1:45:17.240 --> 1:45:21.640]  the CPS kidnapping kids and we can't fight the private Federal Reserve and we
[1:45:21.640 --> 1:45:26.040]  can't go try to stop GM being sent to China and Brazil because it's of the
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:32.880]  Lord that is a load of garbage and a cop out Bob Chapman I agree completely and
[1:45:32.880 --> 1:45:38.880]  that's why I'm here all my life I've never given up on anything and whether
[1:45:38.880 --> 1:45:45.040]  the lead's flying or not and the words are flying now and we know you and I and
[1:45:45.040 --> 1:45:50.000]  others who do what we do we're in the sights of the government and sooner or
[1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:53.840]  later they're gonna try to shut us down well they better do it darn quick
[1:45:53.840 --> 1:45:58.640]  because we are reaching and I've said this on the program before so many
[1:45:58.640 --> 1:46:04.200]  people all over the world it's exploding exponentially it's insane I get these
[1:46:04.200 --> 1:46:11.200]  letters from England and Holland and and Kazakhstan and Columbia and Mexico and
[1:46:11.200 --> 1:46:18.640]  all over from Italy I get a very nice group of pitches from the pool I guess
[1:46:18.640 --> 1:46:24.800]  he's probably the top soccer player in Italy and for by Byron Munich he sent me
[1:46:24.800 --> 1:46:30.000]  all these beautiful pitches with his golden boot which would be like getting
[1:46:30.000 --> 1:46:34.280]  the batting title for the National League or something like that and you
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:39.640]  know the people you run into who were meeting who know what we're talking
[1:46:39.640 --> 1:46:47.120]  about and are as excited as we are that we're gonna be successful and again I'm
[1:46:47.120 --> 1:46:50.680]  seeing the arrogance of four or five years ago the establishment leaving
[1:46:50.680 --> 1:46:54.400]  their eyes they're not they don't have those jackass smiles on their faces
[1:46:54.400 --> 1:46:58.120]  anymore do they Bob because they know millions of us are committed at ramming
[1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:02.680]  speed to ram them in the info war and we're boarding the enemy right now and
[1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:07.040]  we know it's a fight to the death we know they're all in committed with their
[1:47:07.040 --> 1:47:11.840]  names their treasure their blood we're committed to and Bob it's such a good
[1:47:11.840 --> 1:47:14.720]  feeling to know we're right to know we're on the right side of history and to
[1:47:14.720 --> 1:47:19.400]  know we're committed and to know that that spirit of liberty is now spreading
[1:47:19.400 --> 1:47:23.000]  I mean I've told the story the last few days because it was so shocking to me I
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:29.840]  can go to England I can go to Costa Rica I can go anywhere Canada anywhere in the
[1:47:29.840 --> 1:47:34.240]  US now and I can walk down a street and if five people pass me one of them is a
[1:47:34.240 --> 1:47:40.480]  fan and a listener that is one-fifth well now I went to put on this exactly and
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:43.520]  it's not about Alex being a big you know big shot it's actually kind of scary I
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:46.400]  better do a good job all these folks listening to the issue is then I go to
[1:47:46.400 --> 1:47:49.680]  Port Aransas this weekend and I go down there every summer because the kids love
[1:47:49.680 --> 1:47:54.240]  it a couple times and I rented a golf cart and it was totally jam packed your
[1:47:54.240 --> 1:47:59.240]  first big weekend of summer and the entire 10 mile beach was cars every 20
[1:47:59.240 --> 1:48:03.960]  30 feet lined up on Saturday and I'm driving this gas-powered golf cart I
[1:48:03.960 --> 1:48:09.760]  rented and every 510 cars or so they just me driving along in a t-shirt with
[1:48:09.760 --> 1:48:14.720]  my kids they would go Alex Jones Alex Jones black people white people kids with
[1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:22.200]  Mohawks old people young people there was some guy who was you know who I who was
[1:48:22.200 --> 1:48:26.680]  running at about 10 miles an hour with the golf cart you know for like 10
[1:48:26.680 --> 1:48:29.560]  minutes look like he was an ultimate fighter or something said Alex Jones I
[1:48:29.560 --> 1:48:34.840]  mean it was blowing me away and then every restaurant we went to the people
[1:48:34.840 --> 1:48:39.740]  serving as the food were listeners Bob I think we've underestimated how bad
[1:48:39.740 --> 1:48:46.280]  we've hit the enemy you could be right and and it's still a long way to go and
[1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:53.960]  and it's a can of worms I think we've got the top opened and now we got a stack
[1:48:53.960 --> 1:48:58.440]  digging into the worms and we got to pull them out one at a time this is the
[1:48:58.440 --> 1:49:04.080]  Fed reserve pitch it over your shoulder we're gonna get rid of it this is the
[1:49:04.080 --> 1:49:10.800]  the revolving door between New York City's Wall Street and bankers and the
[1:49:10.800 --> 1:49:15.160]  Treasury Department that worm throw it over your shoulder we're getting rid of
[1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:18.880]  them too we're gonna stop them from doing that there's qualified people all
[1:49:18.880 --> 1:49:23.520]  over America who could work in Washington and Paul Craig Roberts is a
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:27.920]  good example of that and on and on and on and that's what we're gonna do we ain't
[1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:33.720]  gonna let them get away with it it's just incredible Bob and you know the
[1:49:33.720 --> 1:49:39.040]  globalists will probably set off nukes or start new wars but to try to force us
[1:49:39.040 --> 1:49:43.920]  back to their bosoms of poison and lies but when the military you have more
[1:49:43.920 --> 1:49:47.840]  money to Ron Paul and all the candidates combined until they got out of the race
[1:49:47.840 --> 1:49:53.480]  than it was Obama to know that everywhere people are waking up to know
[1:49:53.480 --> 1:49:56.800]  that even if the globalists pull the same old tricks people are now more and
[1:49:56.800 --> 1:50:03.360]  more wise to them I see any way the enemy slices it short of them nuking
[1:50:03.360 --> 1:50:07.240]  every major city and releasing bio weapons and then trying to go in their
[1:50:07.240 --> 1:50:10.760]  bunkers and come back out after we're all dead short of that I think they're
[1:50:10.760 --> 1:50:14.560]  gonna lose and I think their own servants if they even try that final
[1:50:14.560 --> 1:50:17.760]  equation which they're capable of then they've written in white papers they
[1:50:17.760 --> 1:50:21.240]  would do a big British Ministry of Defense report last year so they use
[1:50:21.240 --> 1:50:26.960]  neutron bombs on their own population they tried to remove them from power it
[1:50:26.960 --> 1:50:30.760]  doesn't matter any way they slice it I see them losing the question is how bad
[1:50:30.760 --> 1:50:36.160]  will the fight be to get there half of us will will probably die if it gets that
[1:50:36.160 --> 1:50:41.560]  far and if you're a new listener and don't believe me London Guardian even
[1:50:41.560 --> 1:50:45.240]  reported that Dick Cheney wants to use race specific bio weapons to wipe out
[1:50:45.240 --> 1:50:49.400]  certain races and that they're standing by with neutron bombs in Europe England
[1:50:49.400 --> 1:50:53.400]  the US if you tried to have a march on Washington they drop a neutron bomb on
[1:50:53.400 --> 1:50:57.680]  you and then say Al Qaeda did it so we got to take over at the county city level
[1:50:57.680 --> 1:51:03.320]  with an idea that's invincible we are surrounded by harmful indoor air that

[1:52:15.400 --> 1:52:19.560]  deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best

[1:54:40.880 --> 1:54:45.120]  what else do you see that's important going on out there and then obviously I
[1:54:45.120 --> 1:54:48.960]  want you to comment on the Chinese laughing at Geithner when he gave a
[1:54:48.960 --> 1:54:52.800]  speech saying everything's fine the dollars strong
[1:54:52.800 --> 1:54:57.120]  it looks like the emperor's new clothes people are starting to notice that it's
[1:54:57.120 --> 1:55:00.720]  the emperor's actually naked as a jaybird
[1:55:00.720 --> 1:55:04.560]  well the kids are outside the box they don't work for anybody
[1:55:04.560 --> 1:55:07.440]  other in school and they say what they think
[1:55:07.440 --> 1:55:10.320]  and they don't really laugh they jeered and booed them
[1:55:10.320 --> 1:55:14.640]  and uh... very few uh... meteor outlets in the united states carried it they
[1:55:14.640 --> 1:55:16.600]  just said there was some laughter
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:20.400]  uh... it was it was uh... sustained believe me
[1:55:20.400 --> 1:55:23.400]  and of course the chinese government knows that but the chinese government in
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:24.360]  a box
[1:55:24.360 --> 1:55:26.400]  they get thirty million unemployed there
[1:55:26.400 --> 1:55:31.000]  spending one point two trillion to get the uh... economy jacked up again to a
[1:55:31.000 --> 1:55:32.320]  eight percent
[1:55:32.320 --> 1:55:35.880]  uh... growth in gdp and i don't think they can do it
[1:55:35.880 --> 1:55:39.160]  uh... they they're sitting on one point five trillion
[1:55:39.160 --> 1:55:42.600]  and dollar denominated securities what are they going to do with them
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:44.640]  and the only thing they can do is buy
[1:55:44.640 --> 1:55:47.800]  commodities as i have been and they should have been buying more gold
[1:55:47.800 --> 1:55:49.440]  which brings us to gold
[1:55:49.440 --> 1:55:53.160]  and that is it's down about nineteen dollars today it was up eighteen dollars
[1:55:53.160 --> 1:55:56.120]  yesterday was down eighty dollars a day before
[1:55:56.120 --> 1:55:57.560]  every time it goes down
[1:55:57.560 --> 1:55:58.880]  buy it
[1:55:58.880 --> 1:56:01.000]  get out there and buy those coins
[1:56:01.000 --> 1:56:04.360]  golden server coins and shares
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:08.320]  it's very important you take advantage of these corrections they only last a day
[1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:09.520]  or two why
[1:56:09.520 --> 1:56:13.320]  because united states government shoving it back down again hoping it'll stay
[1:56:13.320 --> 1:56:17.320]  down and they're wrong the whole world is clamoring for gold and silver
[1:56:17.320 --> 1:56:19.400]  who's got a head in their shoulders
[1:56:19.400 --> 1:56:20.880]  on fact bob
[1:56:20.880 --> 1:56:24.680]  for the first time in u.s history major insurance companies bloomberg is
[1:56:24.680 --> 1:56:25.720]  reporting
[1:56:25.720 --> 1:56:29.360]  are buying huge positions in physical gold
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:32.520]  uh... as a hedge against an imploding currency
[1:56:32.520 --> 1:56:34.440]  northwest in mutual life
[1:56:34.440 --> 1:56:37.160]  four hundred million dollars worth and they say they think it's going
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:38.720]  substantially higher
[1:56:38.720 --> 1:56:41.040]  and that is the first in your right
[1:56:41.040 --> 1:56:42.800]  and you read it first
[1:56:42.800 --> 1:56:45.040]  in the international forecaster
[1:56:45.040 --> 1:56:48.080]  the international forecaster dot com
[1:56:48.080 --> 1:56:50.600]  uh... you know this is kind of uh...
[1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:55.040]  mexican standoff as they say where everybody's pointing guns at everybody
[1:56:55.040 --> 1:56:58.480]  but there is now a faster move towards the door
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:02.080]  towards dumping the dollar i mean they're now having to admit that
[1:57:02.080 --> 1:57:04.880]  uh... do you think we'll be able to jack the dollar up again for a while for a
[1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:06.000]  year or two
[1:57:06.000 --> 1:57:09.560]  or or is this the beginning of the uh... circling the drain
[1:57:09.560 --> 1:57:11.840]  they can't do this or clean the drain
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:15.360]  and you know this four trillion dollars in currencies traded the day
[1:57:15.360 --> 1:57:18.760]  on the uh... for exchange for an exchange
[1:57:18.760 --> 1:57:21.560]  and about one-and-a-half trillion is in dollars
[1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:23.440]  now someone's going to tell me
[1:57:23.440 --> 1:57:24.800]  for how many days
[1:57:24.800 --> 1:57:27.800]  the u.s. government thinks that they're going to be able to affect in this
[1:57:27.800 --> 1:57:29.080]  market today
[1:57:29.080 --> 1:57:30.320]  in currencies
[1:57:30.320 --> 1:57:33.960]  the value of the dollar i mean how many trillion dollars can i come up with
[1:57:33.960 --> 1:57:35.280]  each day to do that
[1:57:35.280 --> 1:57:36.320]  they can't
[1:57:36.320 --> 1:57:38.680]  they can affect it for one day and that's it
[1:57:38.680 --> 1:57:41.720]  the same thing is with gold and silver and i think
[1:57:41.720 --> 1:57:43.640]  the government is out of gold
[1:57:43.640 --> 1:57:48.720]  and i'll tell you why this report came up by rob curby this week he backed into
[1:57:48.720 --> 1:57:51.080]  the export of gold compounds
[1:57:51.080 --> 1:57:52.100]  and what they are
[1:57:52.100 --> 1:57:55.140]  is coin mail from nineteen thirty three
[1:57:55.140 --> 1:57:57.860]  the u.s. government is at the bottom of the barrel
[1:57:57.860 --> 1:58:01.560]  they've been selling gold into the market and they'd be using maybe germany or
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:02.760]  france to do it
[1:58:02.760 --> 1:58:06.000]  and they're delivering that they sold a billion bars and they're now getting
[1:58:06.000 --> 1:58:08.600]  into coin mail for those that don't know that means
[1:58:08.600 --> 1:58:12.000]  bottom of the barrel the international forecaster dot com people get a free

[2:00:40.760 --> 2:00:46.040]  psychologist in psychiatry documents i've read about the history of eugenics
[2:00:46.040 --> 2:00:49.840]  the new order plan my film in game blueprint for global enslavement covers
[2:00:49.840 --> 2:00:53.760]  it so i'm someone of a scholar i tell you allen is just even more of a scholar
[2:00:53.760 --> 2:00:58.680]  than i am because he specifically focuses in on that and this system of
[2:00:58.680 --> 2:01:01.920]  control and i want to go over some of the current events that are happening
[2:01:01.920 --> 2:01:06.920]  right now and see how he sees that playing in the social controllers and
[2:01:06.920 --> 2:01:11.040]  what they're trying to set up and do i have to say though allen i really see
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:14.800]  things not going well for the globalist i i don't see him as omnipresent and
[2:01:14.800 --> 2:01:19.320]  and and all knowing i do know they understand human nature and study our
[2:01:19.320 --> 2:01:23.680]  psychology and our instincts and manipulate us against each other but i
[2:01:23.680 --> 2:01:27.200]  see more and more people waking up to the matrix waking up that everything
[2:01:27.200 --> 2:01:33.400]  they're told is spin or lies and the little mind tricks they play i like i
[2:01:33.400 --> 2:01:38.000]  had psychology today two hour interview yesterday for a big large cover story in
[2:01:38.000 --> 2:01:44.720]  there and coming out in a few months and they were still kind of spouting the
[2:01:44.720 --> 2:01:51.640]  old download that there is no new world order and it's schizophrenic to think so
[2:01:51.640 --> 2:01:55.560]  while hundreds of publications announced there's a world government but it's a
[2:01:55.560 --> 2:02:00.680]  good thing and we should all accept it so i really don't see them hitting on all
[2:02:00.680 --> 2:02:04.680]  cylinders and getting all their different flavors of propaganda put out
[2:02:04.680 --> 2:02:13.080]  correctly or is that by design it's by design they start off with the fact that
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:19.000]  the system we are in was set up by their forefathers for this time we're all in
[2:02:19.000 --> 2:02:24.720]  this one boat we've all arrived here and it's all through the planning and
[2:02:24.720 --> 2:02:28.720]  machinations of previous generations of these big think tanks foundations and
[2:02:28.720 --> 2:02:32.680]  so on they have brought us to where they want us to be right now they are aware
[2:02:32.680 --> 2:02:36.520]  because they they've constantly taking polls and surveys on the internet and
[2:02:36.520 --> 2:02:41.520]  what you think of this etc to see how majority of people are reacting to the
[2:02:41.520 --> 2:02:46.040]  changes and it's so easy now with internet instance communication data
[2:02:46.040 --> 2:02:51.040]  retrieval they know exactly how the public car but we always end up where are
[2:02:51.040 --> 2:02:55.080]  we exactly we're here they put us in the first place this is the only one system
[2:02:55.080 --> 2:02:59.840]  we have we have been given and they're updating their system into the next
[2:02:59.840 --> 2:03:04.360]  phase it's already done really it simply hasn't been announced or we haven't seen
[2:03:04.360 --> 2:03:08.520]  the manifestations of the implementations a total full force
[2:03:08.520 --> 2:03:13.440]  implementations of it all it's all set up for the global system but it's to be
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:18.480]  an authoritarian system and what we'll notice the average person will notice in
[2:03:18.480 --> 2:03:23.320]  newspapers and government in fact they'll be given more that the old
[2:03:23.320 --> 2:03:28.040]  political stance of humoring the public is going out the window and we're being
[2:03:28.040 --> 2:03:34.520]  dictated to by top generally appointees not so much the politicians the green
[2:03:34.520 --> 2:03:39.200]  appointees etc put there by the big foundations that they're making these
[2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:44.560]  dictatorial statements of how we must live etc and how we must reduce the
[2:03:44.560 --> 2:03:50.480]  population and so on and so on this is the change over from the old idea that
[2:03:50.480 --> 2:03:55.240]  we believed that we were given this big con that we had democracy and it was
[2:03:55.240 --> 2:04:00.280]  always stated from the Fabian society eventually they would be we become an
[2:04:00.280 --> 2:04:05.440]  authoritarian body over the public who would be trained to accept that
[2:04:05.440 --> 2:04:10.240]  authoritarian dictate from the leaders that's the training phase we're going
[2:04:10.240 --> 2:04:16.240]  through right now in fact that's what's happening I want to talk about the
[2:04:16.240 --> 2:04:20.120]  carbon taxes the global model who the new order are what their master plan is
[2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:23.840]  and then go through some of the current things like Obama who whatever he says
[2:04:23.840 --> 2:04:26.760]  it's always the opposite so now he's going and saying he wants to be friends
[2:04:26.760 --> 2:04:30.880]  with the Muslims they can be assured he's not under the opposite but but but
[2:04:30.880 --> 2:04:36.240]  say he loves them as he ups the troops and the invasions and the wars we'll
[2:04:36.240 --> 2:04:39.960]  talk about all of that with Alan Watt great researcher great political mind

[2:08:01.760 --> 2:08:18.560]  is the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[2:08:18.560 --> 2:08:22.560]  our regular guest joins us alan we have a lot of new stations picking us up this
[2:08:22.560 --> 2:08:26.760]  week and i want to get into the bigger picture and where the globalists are
[2:08:26.760 --> 2:08:30.480]  taking us you know when i talk to mainstream media when they interview me
[2:08:30.480 --> 2:08:36.320]  or when i discuss things you know the establishment press i'm always talking
[2:08:36.320 --> 2:08:40.400]  to these reporters and i think most of them genuinely are ignorant just like
[2:08:40.400 --> 2:08:43.960]  most americans you talk to don't even know what the fourth or fifth amendment
[2:08:43.960 --> 2:08:49.840]  is much less the second or first and it's very very sad but everything was
[2:08:49.840 --> 2:08:53.440]  set up on eugenics everything was set up to carry out a culling of the
[2:08:53.440 --> 2:08:58.480]  population everything is this highly engineered society and i don't think a
[2:08:58.480 --> 2:09:03.240]  lot of even new listeners or even some longtime listeners understand just how
[2:09:03.240 --> 2:09:07.400]  much of our society is engineered and dominated by these people so so so
[2:09:07.400 --> 2:09:12.640]  breakdown in total in in your world view what the new world order is what it
[2:09:12.640 --> 2:09:16.920]  stands for what it's pushing the phase we're in right now and where it's
[2:09:16.920 --> 2:09:22.560]  ultimately leading us in this quote final revolution of dehumanization and
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:29.120]  tyranny allen what yeah we can trace it but they're back and their own books in
[2:09:29.120 --> 2:09:33.600]  fact in recorded history allowed history that which they've published for us to
[2:09:33.600 --> 2:09:41.160]  read right back to the seventeen hundred when the elite establishment who
[2:09:41.160 --> 2:09:46.320]  already ruled the money system they've taken off a a group actually were sent
[2:09:46.320 --> 2:09:50.800]  into europe to take over the money system and become as albert pike said
[2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:55.640]  himself and his own book morals and dogma the masters over the masters of the
[2:09:55.640 --> 2:09:59.160]  world other words to create central banking systems that would be all
[2:09:59.160 --> 2:10:03.000]  linked together for a global system that might not appear for another two
[2:10:03.000 --> 2:10:09.360]  hundred years and everything runs from in a money system from the capstone of
[2:10:09.360 --> 2:10:14.440]  money downwards laws government everything goes cap and hand to the
[2:10:14.440 --> 2:10:18.520]  guys with the money at the top so you can create an entire system structure
[2:10:18.520 --> 2:10:22.360]  need to permit beneath you if you control all of the money in the lending
[2:10:22.360 --> 2:10:27.240]  of the borrowing so it was not too hard to create that kind of system they also
[2:10:27.240 --> 2:10:31.960]  could eradicate all small competition of small money lenders small banks and so
[2:10:31.960 --> 2:10:36.240]  on on the way as long as they were in charge of the money supply for entire
[2:10:36.240 --> 2:10:42.480]  countries they rule those countries but along with that too was a religion an
[2:10:42.480 --> 2:10:48.720]  religion was based on a natural existing order of elite intellectual elites who
[2:10:48.720 --> 2:10:53.960]  had already been been doing the darwinian experiment of specialized
[2:10:53.960 --> 2:10:57.240]  breeding for mates for a long long time
[2:10:57.240 --> 2:11:01.640]  uh... at the end taylor a scientist in canada put up excellent book out on the
[2:11:01.640 --> 2:11:05.640]  histories of some of these families such as charles darwin
[2:11:05.640 --> 2:11:10.120]  charles darwin was what the fifth generation of darwin's who only married
[2:11:10.120 --> 2:11:14.320]  into the wedged wood family all the wives were taken from the wedged wood
[2:11:14.320 --> 2:11:20.320]  family for five generations and when charles darwin's wife died he married his
[2:11:20.320 --> 2:11:26.320]  mother's sister a wedged wood again and the idea being they were trying to make
[2:11:26.320 --> 2:11:32.960]  up scientifically uh... to create a scientific elite on one hand this is also
[2:11:32.960 --> 2:11:37.600]  validated by hoxley the hoxley's were also related to the darwins and they
[2:11:37.600 --> 2:11:42.080]  admitted that that was part of the experiment to create a guardian elite
[2:11:42.080 --> 2:11:47.720]  along the lines of plato and his republic where they'd be the guardians of the
[2:11:47.720 --> 2:11:54.640]  planet the natural superior superman type with virtue intelligence common sense
[2:11:54.640 --> 2:12:01.440]  who would rule all the lesser peoples in a standing order all the way down and on
[2:12:01.440 --> 2:12:04.480]  the way they also needed other organizations that would help them
[2:12:04.480 --> 2:12:08.920]  implement a new system and hold it that's why they introduced first rose
[2:12:08.920 --> 2:12:14.320]  accrucianism then freemasonry that was the existing order now the bypass that
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:19.440]  but the same special breeding program it's all through eugenics still goes on
[2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:24.520]  the idea being if you have a woman who's gifted in a scientific area or
[2:12:24.520 --> 2:12:28.920]  mathematics you made them up with a similar type of male you see but it
[2:12:28.920 --> 2:12:32.280]  must have other qualities too that have passed on for generations that can be
[2:12:32.280 --> 2:12:37.800]  validated in a check before they're made it together now if you grew up in
[2:12:37.800 --> 2:12:42.560]  europe and you study the elite families you'll notice that none of them ever
[2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:47.160]  picked their own wives they have teams of people who literally go through the
[2:12:47.160 --> 2:12:52.440]  genealogies for potential mates and match them up that's how prince charles was
[2:12:52.440 --> 2:12:57.400]  matched up with lady Diana it's arranged marriages just like with cattle breeding
[2:12:57.400 --> 2:13:03.880]  exactly and in fact an american eugenics society came out full force backed by
[2:13:03.880 --> 2:13:09.160]  the carnage first and then the Rockefeller Foundation that mandated
[2:13:09.160 --> 2:13:14.120]  the enforced sterilization for inferior types said they could not bring
[2:13:14.120 --> 2:13:19.000]  inferior types into this future that means anyone with hereditary illnesses
[2:13:19.000 --> 2:13:25.120]  of any kind physical or mental and they put out so they set up the cold springs
[2:13:25.120 --> 2:13:29.280]  harbor new york their map plus they brought in the american cattle men's
[2:13:29.280 --> 2:13:33.040]  association because they were the best ones to do with beating and now they
[2:13:33.040 --> 2:13:38.400]  were transferring that that's data on to humans they came up with the idea back
[2:13:38.400 --> 2:13:44.400]  by Rockefeller that they would introduce institute a national census and census
[2:13:44.400 --> 2:13:50.200]  inception the purpose of census would take data on physical and mental health
[2:13:50.200 --> 2:13:56.040]  moral behavior etc prison records all of that collect all of that data and
[2:13:56.040 --> 2:14:00.880]  eventually to start eradicating those people we saw as being hereditary
[2:14:00.880 --> 2:14:05.320]  problems to the perfect upcoming utopia and let me stop you there because I
[2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:09.600]  want to listeners understand something everything you're hearing is part of
[2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:13.720]  mainline history allen's not telling you anything that isn't in all the major
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:18.680]  textbooks the history books but they think it's good when the Texas board asked
[2:14:18.680 --> 2:14:25.000]  the head state psychiatrist wire 67% 68% of the kids on psychotropic drugs and
[2:14:25.000 --> 2:14:30.320]  foster care he said because they have bad genes they deserve it and they set up
[2:14:30.320 --> 2:14:34.240]  the social welfare networks they set up the health departments to carry out
[2:14:34.240 --> 2:14:39.400]  racial hygiene hitler only adopted what was taught in England and the United
[2:14:39.400 --> 2:14:43.040]  States and now that's what their zoning is about that's what their animal IDs
[2:14:43.040 --> 2:14:46.960]  about it's what's taking over the farms and ranches is about they've got to take
[2:14:46.960 --> 2:14:52.680]  over our infrastructure and our access to money and our access to independence
[2:14:52.680 --> 2:14:57.360]  and freedom so they can force us into the one-child policy and through the new
[2:14:57.360 --> 2:15:02.080]  economy of the green economy that's really the eugenics economy of reduced
[2:15:02.080 --> 2:15:06.200]  standard of living so that you can't afford to have children it's all openly
[2:15:06.200 --> 2:15:11.320]  stated and now even being introduced on mainstream TV and everywhere so I wanted
[2:15:11.320 --> 2:15:16.960]  to throw in that everything you're saying is on the record that the Darwin's
[2:15:16.960 --> 2:15:20.760]  and three other families only intermarried together for five six seven
[2:15:20.760 --> 2:15:27.120]  generations but that it created aberrant mentally ill monsters look at the
[2:15:27.120 --> 2:15:30.360]  Huxley's for instance the Huxley's were descended from the Darwin's to they were
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:36.120]  also intermarried yes and and the Huxley's especially Julian and Aldous
[2:15:36.120 --> 2:15:41.400]  father literally it's been a career chopping up people's bodies to try and get
[2:15:41.400 --> 2:15:44.520]  secrets of life and all this kind of stuff they're worth it the pressure to
[2:15:44.520 --> 2:15:49.760]  what we call eugenics today or genetics today and as you said cold springs
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:54.240]  harbor cold springs harbor is IBM human genome today and they had had to step
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:58.280]  down saying blacks weren't humans that's always been the eugenics board now they
[2:15:58.280 --> 2:16:02.640]  take blood forcibly for 36 years from everybody in the western world at birth
[2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:08.240]  they've now admitted that and I have two mainstream news articles today this is
[2:16:08.240 --> 2:16:15.400]  out of the Buffalo news ruling allows taser use to get DNA maybe nation's
[2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:22.040]  first ruling and they say Cavill prods electric shock torture in the federal
[2:16:22.040 --> 2:16:26.960]  ruling is now officially legal to make you answer questions to make you
[2:16:26.960 --> 2:16:31.320]  urinate in a cup to make you give a blood sample at checkpoints are they
[2:16:31.320 --> 2:16:35.000]  surveyed other courts ruling here in Austin will be able to taser you if you
[2:16:35.000 --> 2:16:39.560]  don't submit to the blood torture is now out in the open we go from it being
[2:16:39.560 --> 2:16:46.080]  Joseph mingle and bad to it being something we only do to al-Qaeda to the
[2:16:46.080 --> 2:16:53.280]  Buffalo daily news openly saying it's good go ahead well yes because we're now
[2:16:53.280 --> 2:16:57.960]  what been since 2001 especially that was the plane purpose for this whole new
[2:16:57.960 --> 2:17:03.120]  world order kickoff we're being trained now that were in an authoritarian system
[2:17:03.120 --> 2:17:07.120]  and you simply do what you're told that's what we're all been trained since
[2:17:07.120 --> 2:17:11.960]  9-11 that's what that was the kickoff Arthur C. Clark who was put up there's
[2:17:11.960 --> 2:17:18.800]  all the big stars and novels and futures to scientists etc and it's been
[2:17:18.800 --> 2:17:23.600]  explained admitted to by big foundations themselves they fund these novelists to
[2:17:23.600 --> 2:17:29.320]  write the future it becomes familiar to us with an idea and it's augmented by
[2:17:29.320 --> 2:17:33.080]  movies and so on until it comes into reality and we don't think about it
[2:17:33.080 --> 2:17:38.000]  being stranger it that it should exist it seems natural as it's called predictive
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:42.800]  programming and after C. Clark in his book 2001 even though he said it in
[2:17:42.800 --> 2:17:47.800]  space was actually giving you the kickoff for for the new order of things
[2:17:47.800 --> 2:17:51.600]  where a new planet would rule another word that's really telling you a new
[2:17:51.600 --> 2:17:55.800]  and later in the book everybody gets microchips everybody communicates with
[2:17:55.800 --> 2:17:59.760]  microchips tell through telepathic systems and then he later of course worked
[2:17:59.760 --> 2:18:05.600]  for MI 6 after World War two for those that don't know OSS during World War
[2:18:05.600 --> 2:18:08.680]  two yeah he invented the telecommunications satellite and he gave
[2:18:08.680 --> 2:18:13.160]  interviews saying no this is what we really plan for you just like H.G. Wells
[2:18:13.160 --> 2:18:16.880]  and everybody else go ahead and a symbol of course in the book was the big giant
[2:18:16.880 --> 2:18:22.680]  oval is the black oval is the perfect shape of authority all down through the
[2:18:22.680 --> 2:18:26.920]  ages that's what the United Nations black building is by the way that's what
[2:18:26.920 --> 2:18:33.000]  that is that's the big oval is and the U.N. was set up to be the hub for a
[2:18:33.000 --> 2:18:38.600]  form at least at least the outward form of the embryo or the embryonic world
[2:18:38.600 --> 2:18:43.120]  government all laws for last 50 years have come from the United Nations to
[2:18:43.120 --> 2:18:47.040]  every country and it's signed into the books by press and notice most of the
[2:18:47.040 --> 2:18:51.080]  crew dies going on the journey only the chosen one
[2:18:51.080 --> 2:18:55.000]  gets to go to the next level and there's a final fight between the computer and
[2:18:55.000 --> 2:18:58.960]  the man for who will be supreme whereas Kurzweil and others just say no
[2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:03.280]  actually we're gonna merge with the machine that will be the new species the
[2:19:03.280 --> 2:19:06.640]  new species will wipe out the rest of the slaves that are left
[2:19:06.640 --> 2:19:11.840]  that's right evolution but it called evolution and evolution is an
[2:19:11.840 --> 2:19:16.520]  interesting word in itself and the whole theory and they'll call stuff
[2:19:16.520 --> 2:19:20.240]  behind it that they used to use in the masonic lodges etc it's on the high
[2:19:20.240 --> 2:19:24.920]  ones but some they do believe and they always have believed that the future
[2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:30.200]  would be theirs that only those with the virtue the natural virtue that they've
[2:19:30.200 --> 2:19:35.800]  inherited from their superior parents would continue and all in fears must be
[2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:39.920]  wiped off because there is no purpose for them a Darwinistic evolutionary
[2:19:39.920 --> 2:19:44.160]  society will bring them this period down the claims we must eliminate them all
[2:19:44.160 --> 2:19:48.080]  together always amazing talking to Ellen what Ellen quick break we're gonna come
[2:19:48.080 --> 2:19:52.720]  right back to you and continue where you left off when I was interjecting with
[2:19:52.720 --> 2:19:56.920]  the architecture of the New World Order and hopefully how we stop it and fight
[2:19:56.920 --> 2:20:00.440]  it and yes we'll take calls coming up forgot to take calls last hour sorry
[2:20:00.440 --> 2:20:07.240]  about that hi I'm Steve shank a wise man once said if a dog ain't biting dogs
[2:20:07.240 --> 2:20:11.080]  don't bite this means most people don't really believe a disaster will hit them
[2:20:11.080 --> 2:20:15.200]  until it does the ones who truly understand self-reliance are those who
[2:20:15.200 --> 2:20:19.480]  have experienced the devastation of a Midwest ice storm tornadoes floods or

[2:23:13.560 --> 2:23:18.080]  starvation and as America continues down its current path for many the reality
[2:23:18.080 --> 2:23:22.520]  of another depression is a very serious concern with massive layoffs and

[2:24:31.920 --> 2:24:35.920]  superior and that they were separate from the commoners well now we have the
[2:24:35.920 --> 2:24:40.880]  BBC headlines that they believe they're a separate race and all these countless
[2:24:40.880 --> 2:24:46.280]  other elites saying they are transhuman the eugenicist run by all the
[2:24:46.280 --> 2:24:50.000]  sucks his brother Julian Huxley at the UN he said in the 50s we got to change
[2:24:50.000 --> 2:24:54.560]  the name from eugenicist a transhumanist I'm not saying all transhumanist are but
[2:24:54.560 --> 2:24:58.840]  your founder was they had eugenicist so they believe that they're taking control
[2:24:58.840 --> 2:25:02.720]  of human evolution human development and right now they just want to lock
[2:25:02.720 --> 2:25:07.400]  everything down call most of us so they can then have their great work
[2:25:07.400 --> 2:25:12.480]  Ellen let's talk about now you talk about the banking takeover the families
[2:25:12.480 --> 2:25:17.160]  we were now into the 19th century 20th century let's get into what they've set
[2:25:17.160 --> 2:25:22.000]  up the psychological dictatorship where they're going and then if they're able
[2:25:22.000 --> 2:25:26.640]  to call us the timeline you see I'm interested in your view on that and then
[2:25:26.640 --> 2:25:32.520]  if they were able to succeed what they're going to build how they see the
[2:25:32.520 --> 2:25:37.200]  future in the big think tanks that work for the British Department of Defense
[2:25:37.200 --> 2:25:42.760]  and I've got up on my website there's 90 pages of predictions of what's to
[2:25:42.760 --> 2:25:49.720]  happen over the next 50 odd years and they claim that around 2010 12 will be
[2:25:49.720 --> 2:25:55.280]  at the beginnings of massive riots and food shortages will be arranged it's
[2:25:55.280 --> 2:25:59.480]  already underway in fact because the big they said this two years ago for those
[2:25:59.480 --> 2:26:03.240]  that just tuned in and this is official British government go ahead and there's
[2:26:03.240 --> 2:26:07.640]  also the think tank that's all NATO countries including the US as they have
[2:26:07.640 --> 2:26:11.720]  in a worldwide evidence to the kickoff really and third world countries and
[2:26:11.720 --> 2:26:17.040]  then escalate into the Western MSP very quickly rapidly and right now they've
[2:26:17.040 --> 2:26:20.280]  already been setting up the entire military structure to deal with the
[2:26:20.280 --> 2:26:26.240]  next 50 years we've seen the build-up and the alteration from police forces
[2:26:26.240 --> 2:26:32.480]  into and to a really internal armies part of the multi-jurisdictional task
[2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:36.800]  force they're all integrated with with police military special forces that's
[2:26:36.800 --> 2:26:42.720]  already done it has been done since the 90s and preparation for what's to come
[2:26:42.720 --> 2:26:48.560]  up and they claim that around the year 2050 there'll be a vastly reduced
[2:26:48.560 --> 2:26:54.680]  population a sudden drop but on the way up to them there'll be escalating
[2:26:54.680 --> 2:26:59.120]  riots there'll be whole city regions and fact the column regions are locked down
[2:26:59.120 --> 2:27:03.800]  under war scenarios we've seen this by the way and all the predictive
[2:27:03.800 --> 2:27:09.240]  programming from every science fiction movie for the last 15 years and it is
[2:27:09.240 --> 2:27:12.920]  the turning out more every year on the same kind of scenarios they're also
[2:27:12.920 --> 2:27:16.800]  saying that the population are being sterilized but we know that because
[2:27:16.800 --> 2:27:21.680]  the official medical World Health Organization tells us every year that
[2:27:21.680 --> 2:27:25.800]  we're almost all sterile and we're dropping rapidly that's also intentional
[2:27:25.800 --> 2:27:29.440]  has been done through inoculations and through the food system because the
[2:27:29.440 --> 2:27:34.440]  bio warfare industry are the same boys that Monsanto belongs to and they're
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:39.720]  making sure that we will come down much faster through sterilization that is
[2:27:39.720 --> 2:27:44.600]  exactly what H.G. Wells said in his book in the modern utopia he lived at the
[2:27:44.600 --> 2:27:50.640]  next 200 years and he said that we won't simply just kill off the unfit he says
[2:27:50.640 --> 2:27:53.680]  will simply sterilize them so that they'll breathe themselves out of
[2:27:53.680 --> 2:28:00.600]  existence and die off so if this is all compartmentalized the local doctor giving
[2:28:00.600 --> 2:28:05.440]  you shots doesn't know this but the IMF the World Bank all the big funds what
[2:28:05.440 --> 2:28:09.360]  two weeks ago Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation secret meeting of the rich
[2:28:09.360 --> 2:28:13.720]  with Warren Buffett and Ted Turner and it said the main agenda was reduce our
[2:28:13.720 --> 2:28:19.040]  population by 80% this is now being thrown in our face yes and then you see
[2:28:19.040 --> 2:28:23.760]  Bill Gates again I see there are no real self-made men up there that they're
[2:28:23.760 --> 2:28:28.760]  very tall they're brought up there that we live under cartels you cannot go up
[2:28:28.760 --> 2:28:32.440]  and compete with him and his dad was they had a Planned Parenthood and I
[2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:36.960]  loved eugenicists so they said we're gonna give your son through the IBM
[2:28:36.960 --> 2:28:42.600]  eugenics trust that's IBM is a trust for eugenics on record we are going to give
[2:28:42.600 --> 2:28:47.040]  your son you know the headship of this because you know we can't have the
[2:28:47.040 --> 2:28:50.040]  public knowing the government really runs all these and that's really on
[2:28:50.040 --> 2:28:54.040]  record for anybody that wants to look at it's and so the entire thing then he
[2:28:54.040 --> 2:28:58.640]  takes the entire fortune of Microsoft and funds it into eugenics publicly yes
[2:28:58.640 --> 2:29:02.080]  and now we come out of course is the big hero of philanthropists they all must
[2:29:02.080 --> 2:29:06.120]  repeat back their masters who brought them up there by becoming philanthropists
[2:29:06.120 --> 2:29:11.320]  just like George Soros and what are they into their into Planned Parenthood
[2:29:11.320 --> 2:29:15.760]  across the planet and abortions sterilizations vasectomy etc that's
[2:29:15.760 --> 2:29:19.960]  really where the money goes but here's the same man now in with the military
[2:29:19.960 --> 2:29:24.120]  industrial complex Mr. Gates with specialized mosquitoes they want to
[2:29:24.120 --> 2:29:28.880]  release all over the third world countries supposedly to help reduce the
[2:29:28.880 --> 2:29:33.920]  mosquito populations by introducing sterile male mosquitoes these things
[2:29:33.920 --> 2:29:38.760]  are going to carry bacterium and viruses very very rapidly no that's what he said
[2:29:38.760 --> 2:29:42.360]  they're gonna put vaccines in them and because the Africans won't take the
[2:29:42.360 --> 2:29:45.800]  shots they're gonna engineer it into potatoes and carrots yeah that's on
[2:29:45.800 --> 2:29:50.520]  record stay there incredible information Alan Watts our guest

[2:36:47.280 --> 2:36:52.760]  globalist master plan and the current operations and then take some calls you
[2:36:52.760 --> 2:36:56.880]  have been having some problems with your three or four websites you wisely had
[2:36:56.880 --> 2:37:01.160]  some mirrors of cut into the matrix.com but now you've been having a lot of
[2:37:01.160 --> 2:37:04.960]  problems and people should know that you've been under a bit of an attack
[2:37:04.960 --> 2:37:09.560]  they're trying to take your registration names away though you register them
[2:37:09.560 --> 2:37:12.920]  years ago and own them they're not letting you upload your servers though
[2:37:12.920 --> 2:37:16.560]  you've paid in advance for a year and you're not getting any answers from from
[2:37:16.560 --> 2:37:21.320]  yahoo on this are you well they rectified it the other day suddenly and
[2:37:21.320 --> 2:37:26.600]  because so many people were protesting and calling them and this went on for a
[2:37:26.600 --> 2:37:31.880]  week and a half he suddenly stopped me uploading to two of the main sites and no
[2:37:31.880 --> 2:37:37.000]  explanation was given I talked to about five different people over the course of
[2:37:37.000 --> 2:37:42.160]  a week and a half and they wouldn't let me talk to the entity engineers who could
[2:37:42.160 --> 2:37:45.920]  possibly have given me the technical problem there was no technical
[2:37:45.920 --> 2:37:50.080]  problem they soon would put a lock on it and someone had obviously from above
[2:37:50.080 --> 2:37:55.200]  given them the suggestion to do this so it's from a high source now at the same
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:37:59.680]  time this was happening friends of mine people I know in other countries were
[2:37:59.680 --> 2:38:05.640]  getting I can getting in touch with them asking if they knew me and why they were
[2:38:05.640 --> 2:38:10.200]  taking out domain names in my name now anyone can do this across the planet if
[2:38:10.200 --> 2:38:13.160]  they want to it's quite legal you see but they wanted to know what the
[2:38:13.160 --> 2:38:19.000]  connections were and so on so as I say after a bombardment of listeners to
[2:38:19.000 --> 2:38:24.960]  yahoo and me mentioning on the air night after night they suddenly takes the
[2:38:24.960 --> 2:38:30.360]  problem and that couldn't tell me what it was and I'm on an unlimited disk base
[2:38:30.360 --> 2:38:34.520]  so wasn't that that was the problem it actually set me back from about nine
[2:38:34.520 --> 2:38:39.480]  and a half gigs which I was up at at that present time maximum with unlimited
[2:38:39.480 --> 2:38:45.200]  disk space to go they set me back to six point five and and well look I mean we
[2:38:45.200 --> 2:38:49.840]  have sophisticated hack attacks against us on record from the big ISPs they
[2:38:49.840 --> 2:38:53.400]  certainly the Pentagon's announced they're going to attack American and
[2:38:53.400 --> 2:38:56.720]  European media that criticizes the new world order they've now said on the news
[2:38:56.720 --> 2:39:00.320]  they're going to start killing journalists there's famous video of the
[2:39:00.320 --> 2:39:05.960]  tanks driving up and killing Reuters journalist over in Iraq okay let's
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:10.640]  accelerate but thank God it's back up let's accelerate Ellen Watt here now
[2:39:10.640 --> 2:39:14.400]  through their master plan and if they're able to succeed what they're going to
[2:39:14.400 --> 2:39:18.560]  set up and then take calls yes they've published the books in fact from the
[2:39:18.560 --> 2:39:22.960]  United Nations and a whole host of umbrella organizations under the
[2:39:22.960 --> 2:39:28.520]  United Nations have published their own books on the future cities I should
[2:39:28.520 --> 2:39:34.200]  mention that back in the 80s I met the man who owns the Polo team that Prince
[2:39:34.200 --> 2:39:41.160]  Charles belongs to and and he is a big Canadian he owns hundreds of corporations
[2:39:41.160 --> 2:39:45.880]  and companies across the US and Canada and Europe he has a state in Ireland
[2:39:45.880 --> 2:39:52.760]  he's a ward and an estate in London and he's also an amateur although
[2:39:52.760 --> 2:39:58.160]  professional architect and to a strange set of circumstances which I didn't
[2:39:58.160 --> 2:40:03.800]  understand at the time he showed me his drawings for the future cities and one of
[2:40:03.800 --> 2:40:10.640]  them this is about 1882 one of them was a dome city over a much smaller
[2:40:10.640 --> 2:40:17.840]  Toronto under a soft glass type dome and I didn't explain why it would be a dome
[2:40:17.840 --> 2:40:22.720]  or anything else and I said well that's a much much smaller Toronto it says yeah
[2:40:22.720 --> 2:40:28.560]  oh yeah that the population will be that small it says about 30 40 years no
[2:40:28.560 --> 2:40:32.320]  explanation given but then a person who works with the United Nations sent me a
[2:40:32.320 --> 2:40:37.200]  book on the future dome cities for the perfect societies across the world and
[2:40:37.200 --> 2:40:42.960]  it's right along the agenda that HG Wells and so on talked about everyone
[2:40:42.960 --> 2:40:48.360]  will be reared in a sort of cache a crash a crash a crash dome you won't know
[2:40:48.360 --> 2:40:51.800]  your parents that's exactly what the Soviet system was supposed to be based
[2:40:51.800 --> 2:40:55.760]  on but it wasn't Marxist enough they tried it in Israel when they set up
[2:40:55.760 --> 2:40:59.600]  Israel by the way where the children would be brought up
[2:40:59.600 --> 2:41:03.720]  communally wouldn't know who their parents were you'd be trained in there up to a
[2:41:03.720 --> 2:41:07.520]  certain age then you'll go to a school dome then if you designate it a work
[2:41:07.520 --> 2:41:12.000]  dome and then you'll have your adult life dome as you work and then you would
[2:41:12.000 --> 2:41:16.760]  put into a gerry attic to all nice and organized like a control freak a plan
[2:41:16.760 --> 2:41:21.540]  your whole life for you this is the world's structured society they want to
[2:41:21.540 --> 2:41:27.640]  create but this is far at the ones who will be doing most of the work for the
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:31.120]  elite and Alan I'm not trying to start fights here because it's very
[2:41:31.120 --> 2:41:34.960]  destructive to get into fights with people that you know are similar to our
[2:41:34.960 --> 2:41:38.320]  views on the New World Order there was a big film made they use a lot of my
[2:41:38.320 --> 2:41:44.520]  footage and other people's footage and it was supposedly anti-New World Order
[2:41:44.520 --> 2:41:49.360]  9-11 truth then their next film called for the dome cities and a robot will
[2:41:49.360 --> 2:41:53.640]  run everything and it'll be a totally controlled society and the makers said
[2:41:53.640 --> 2:41:57.640]  that I would have to be put in a reeducation center but that I couldn't
[2:41:57.640 --> 2:42:01.800]  intellectually understand and grasp why this had to be done no I I understand
[2:42:01.800 --> 2:42:05.520]  the power trip these people are on and I kept saying to him I heard all this a
[2:42:05.520 --> 2:42:09.080]  hundred years ago from the eugenicist what you're saying is right out of the
[2:42:09.080 --> 2:42:12.640]  Soviet model right out of the Fabian socialist model this is the New World
[2:42:12.640 --> 2:42:16.840]  Order and they'd say no it's not and I'd say but that's a fact even these
[2:42:16.840 --> 2:42:21.520]  drawings and diagrams aren't new I'm not starting a fight with these film makers
[2:42:21.520 --> 2:42:28.640]  I'm just stating a fact and they got very very angry and started attacking us
[2:42:28.640 --> 2:42:33.520]  and then play this mental game of saying no this is something totally new Alan
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:37.000]  you know what I'm talking about don't you we have this is not totally new is
[2:42:37.000 --> 2:42:42.280]  it not at all the whole 20th century was mapped out including the wars because
[2:42:42.280 --> 2:42:47.000]  people like it she wells who was a founder of the Fabian society who was
[2:42:47.000 --> 2:42:51.920]  picked up by sir Thomas Huxley the grandfather of the Huxley the best
[2:42:51.920 --> 2:42:56.120]  friend of Charles Darwin he picked a whole bunch of young men up he taught
[2:42:56.120 --> 2:43:00.560]  them in the red tie school they're all given red ties for revolution they're
[2:43:00.560 --> 2:43:04.280]  all guaranteed to become very famous because unlimited financing would give
[2:43:04.280 --> 2:43:09.760]  them complete access to all media and and they were to go to be propagandist
[2:43:09.760 --> 2:43:14.920]  for the eugenics a utopian scientifically run and they did the
[2:43:14.920 --> 2:43:19.840]  predictive programming to set the maps of man so people would follow this
[2:43:19.840 --> 2:43:24.200]  predetermined system and then they wrote books bragging they'd done this none of
[2:43:24.200 --> 2:43:29.640]  this is our opinion that's right and also well himself said that we need a
[2:43:29.640 --> 2:43:33.720]  world war it and after World War one is that not enough people have come to their
[2:43:33.720 --> 2:43:37.600]  knees did not give enough national sovereignty it said we need another world
[2:43:37.600 --> 2:43:42.600]  war it to bring this into existence World War two bring brought in the United
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:47.440]  Nations and every country signed on to it and that's when all sovereignty was
[2:43:47.440 --> 2:43:53.160]  signed away and the whole future agenda was going to be implemented in reality
[2:43:53.160 --> 2:44:00.680]  yeah so the was was planned including what they have planned for this century
[2:44:00.680 --> 2:44:06.280]  this is to be the century of change every top professor across the planet in
[2:44:06.280 --> 2:44:11.440]  academia has talked about the century of change for the larger part of the 20th
[2:44:11.440 --> 2:44:16.400]  century talking about the 21st century Obama's whole premise was changes good
[2:44:16.400 --> 2:44:19.280]  no one asked him for he's talking about what the change are you talking about
[2:44:19.280 --> 2:44:23.600]  this is their century to implement the final stages as they reduce the
[2:44:23.600 --> 2:44:27.520]  population they bring through the creme de la creme at the bank they give it off
[2:44:27.520 --> 2:44:31.440]  the weak the unfit the mental unstable anyone with a registry physical or
[2:44:31.440 --> 2:44:36.640]  mental problems and that's in the book by hg wells called a modern utopia but
[2:44:36.640 --> 2:44:41.640]  this is one to bring up to you but when you really read their literature they
[2:44:41.640 --> 2:44:45.160]  sell their lower-level minions who are on little petty power trips that oh
[2:44:45.160 --> 2:44:48.560]  you're part of the elite society we're gonna call everybody they don't tell
[2:44:48.560 --> 2:44:52.400]  them that they're gonna be called as well or that it's not just positive in
[2:44:52.400 --> 2:44:55.520]  and negative eugenics that is taught that oh we're gonna get rid of the
[2:44:55.520 --> 2:45:00.800]  inferiors and advance the elites the elite actually is waging war against
[2:45:00.800 --> 2:45:05.080]  those that are intelligent that are bright that that they're actually that's
[2:45:05.080 --> 2:45:11.080]  their main target and that these control freaks are trying to wreck society to
[2:45:11.080 --> 2:45:17.320]  accelerate their master plan so really you can argue with their stated goal of
[2:45:17.320 --> 2:45:22.560]  a better world in a healthier elite but that's evil in of itself because of
[2:45:22.560 --> 2:45:25.800]  what it leads to but really that's only a facade as well
[2:45:25.800 --> 2:45:31.080]  if lord betrothal another high member who helped change the outlook of many
[2:45:31.080 --> 2:45:35.480]  millions of people by his writings he was one of them he wanted followers to
[2:45:35.480 --> 2:45:39.640]  create mass movements to help the idiots bring it all to be to become into
[2:45:39.640 --> 2:45:44.600]  being he said himself though he said we must through schooling he says check
[2:45:44.600 --> 2:45:49.360]  through various testing for certain people with special IQ abilities
[2:45:49.360 --> 2:45:54.840]  abilities of communication who could influence the masses and recruit them
[2:45:54.840 --> 2:45:59.720]  he says if we can't recruit them on our side to work for us we must eradicate
[2:45:59.720 --> 2:46:03.560]  them eliminate them that's what he said because they might influence the masses
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:08.800]  against this plan in other words kill them off but if you must kill them
[2:46:08.800 --> 2:46:14.200]  and he wrote books and got Nobel Prizes and other awards for this and it's
[2:46:14.200 --> 2:46:17.440]  called the big liberal just like Margaret Sanger is called a liberal and
[2:46:17.440 --> 2:46:21.800]  they love the name black schools after I went to predominantly black school in
[2:46:21.800 --> 2:46:27.800]  kindergarten in Dallas yeah Margaret Sanger kindergarten in first grade and
[2:46:27.800 --> 2:46:32.160]  there was Margaret Sanger statue it's all a big sick joke isn't it like it
[2:46:32.160 --> 2:46:38.840]  Sanger said that children were weeds that's term in her own writings weep well
[2:46:38.840 --> 2:46:42.480]  she said blacks were weeds that had to be eradicated mm-hmm but all children you
[2:46:42.480 --> 2:46:46.880]  said all children brought a certain class of income were weep that's what she
[2:46:46.880 --> 2:46:52.320]  said yeah absolutely degenerate and disgusting and you know when I'm
[2:46:52.320 --> 2:46:55.440]  talking to psychiatrists and psychologists that call me from say
[2:46:55.440 --> 2:46:58.920]  psychology today or other publications I've talked to a few in the last year
[2:46:58.920 --> 2:47:02.440]  because they're real obsessed now on being on power trips I'm not saying this
[2:47:02.440 --> 2:47:06.480]  particular writer but the stories I've seen they have been where they analyze
[2:47:06.480 --> 2:47:13.200]  us and we're crazy and none of this exists while it's all admitted it exists I
[2:47:13.200 --> 2:47:18.480]  found that a lot of them aren't even that intelligent they're just on kind of a
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:24.480]  power trip and that they're so wedded to the false reality that they have to say
[2:47:24.480 --> 2:47:29.280]  we're wrong and something's wrong with us just out of a power trip control
[2:47:29.280 --> 2:47:33.520]  freak nature they can't imagine that somebody outside their system could
[2:47:33.520 --> 2:47:37.560]  actually analyze how the world operates or or they'll tell us there are no
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:41.040]  morals but then they will try to tell us what their morals are and that we've
[2:47:41.040 --> 2:47:45.680]  got to follow them they play all sorts of mind games it's mind games and a lot
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:49.800]  of them too mind you know darn well which way the wind is blowing and they
[2:47:49.800 --> 2:47:54.080]  hope to please their masters and be some of the chosen few who come through but
[2:47:54.080 --> 2:47:59.560]  again by the Julian Huxley he said many many will work towards his thinking that
[2:47:59.560 --> 2:48:03.160]  they have been chosen but they will be deemed unworthy in the end they'll be
[2:48:03.160 --> 2:48:10.160]  used well that's another thing if you look at these actual elites they are
[2:48:10.160 --> 2:48:13.800]  degenerate they are inbred like hybrid dogs that was all sorts of mental
[2:48:13.800 --> 2:48:19.520]  problems health problems in fact interbreeding with the pharaohs with the
[2:48:19.520 --> 2:48:25.600]  British with the French it it leads towards insanity and I think that you
[2:48:25.600 --> 2:48:28.560]  know they're saying we're all mentally ill and they're making all normal human
[2:48:28.560 --> 2:48:32.440]  behavior mentally ill except their psychopathic behavior they're saying
[2:48:32.440 --> 2:48:36.360]  that's good that's right and it's no doubt about it to be played so it's
[2:48:36.360 --> 2:48:40.120]  said about it all that two thousand three hundred years ago is that we can
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:43.800]  breathe in traits or breathe out traits and for leaders who want to
[2:48:43.800 --> 2:48:48.320]  breathe out certain emotional traits we have psychopaths definitely who are
[2:48:48.320 --> 2:48:53.200]  intergenerational in charge of this world system who truly believe they are
[2:48:53.200 --> 2:48:57.920]  the only same people on earth yeah I've met a lot of them and they really do
[2:48:57.920 --> 2:49:03.040]  revel in there being above you and because of that attitude they've lost
[2:49:03.040 --> 2:49:08.240]  their basic humanity and they're so shuttered but they are specialized in a
[2:49:08.240 --> 2:49:13.200]  predatory fashion to just be pure machines of deceit and manipulation and
[2:49:13.200 --> 2:49:18.520]  they love the dumb-down cattle they they have celebrations laughing at the cattle
[2:49:18.520 --> 2:49:23.320]  and then they say that because they're so easily butchered that the cattle
[2:49:23.320 --> 2:49:29.920]  deserve it when that's humanity yeah that's right I always get the analogy of
[2:49:29.920 --> 2:49:34.800]  a farmer in the field who breaks the legs of a cow and then kicks the cow and
[2:49:34.800 --> 2:49:39.360]  hates it because they can't get up they have brought people down to utter misery
[2:49:39.360 --> 2:49:43.480]  through their machinations down to the especially the 20th century into the
[2:49:43.480 --> 2:49:49.280]  present and all their games have played in poverty introduction etc and then
[2:49:49.280 --> 2:49:53.360]  they blame the people for the state that they're in but that seems so
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:58.120]  a statistic strange warped mentality of the farmer breaking that the cattle
[2:49:58.120 --> 2:50:02.240]  cows then taking it they can't get up that's a perfect analogy take take the
[2:50:02.240 --> 2:50:06.920]  Royal Commission on Population 44 to 49 funded by his majesty and in its
[2:50:06.920 --> 2:50:11.680]  public at states we're gonna carry out eugenics but to wreck the third world
[2:50:11.680 --> 2:50:15.880]  we're actually gonna make sure they have more kids at first so that that holds
[2:50:15.880 --> 2:50:20.360]  their society back but then we'll kill them and sterilize them later in life
[2:50:20.360 --> 2:50:26.880]  it's kind of like the 223 caliber in Vietnam to wound people to cause more
[2:50:26.880 --> 2:50:30.800]  resource sapping instead of just killing them they say we're gonna wound the
[2:50:30.800 --> 2:50:36.040]  world to hold everybody down they're not trying to lift man up no oh they're
[2:50:36.040 --> 2:50:41.320]  cosmic criminals Alan they are they are and they know what's the state because of
[2:50:41.320 --> 2:50:47.200]  the public truly did know we'd have to make a decision to want to do with them
[2:50:47.200 --> 2:50:50.360]  yeah well I've always said if there's too many of us the elite ought to just all
[2:50:50.360 --> 2:50:54.280]  commit suicide I think the world be in a lot better position to be choked by
[2:50:54.280 --> 2:50:58.840]  example at least by example that's what they should do stay there Alan we take

[2:54:15.320 --> 2:54:19.680]  very saddening to me a lot of times laying in bed at 2 a.m. at night I'm
[2:54:19.680 --> 2:54:23.880]  like man how do I get people to read the government's own documents all these
[2:54:23.880 --> 2:54:27.440]  think tanks some publications they're calling a scum they're calling as
[2:54:27.440 --> 2:54:30.840]  slaves they're saying they're gonna eradicate us they're brainwashing the
[2:54:30.840 --> 2:54:34.360]  kids that humans are bad and we've got to be gotten rid of there they're
[2:54:34.360 --> 2:54:42.120]  selling us their culture of death and that resource use is bad and some
[2:54:42.120 --> 2:54:45.440]  people are waking up a lot of folks are waking up but I don't think fast enough
[2:54:45.440 --> 2:54:48.320]  Alan what we're going to calls in a moment in this segment the next I'm
[2:54:48.320 --> 2:54:51.280]  gonna let you go at five after we appreciate your time Max Kaiser is
[2:54:51.280 --> 2:54:56.240]  coming up but but I mean in closing before we talk to Lily and Sherry and a
[2:54:56.240 --> 2:55:06.120]  few others is that the leg up that they have I mean is that their their ace in
[2:55:06.120 --> 2:55:10.280]  the hole that we have a blind spot that there could be a group this evil
[2:55:10.280 --> 2:55:13.480]  operating like this even though they're admitting they're doing it that the
[2:55:13.480 --> 2:55:18.320]  common person just is so is so subconsciously afraid they can't admit
[2:55:18.320 --> 2:55:23.000]  this to themselves that's part of it's this denial of that such month see
[2:55:23.000 --> 2:55:29.320]  average person can understand the little wrongs they do in their own life the
[2:55:29.320 --> 2:55:33.240]  little lies the fight lies etc. that they do in their own life they cannot
[2:55:33.240 --> 2:55:37.880]  understand people who can do the big lie hit Adolf Hitler said that if you have
[2:55:37.880 --> 2:55:43.720]  to tell a lie to literally control the people's minds you tell a massive lie
[2:55:43.720 --> 2:55:47.960]  and the people will say it must be true it must be true the orcata is
[2:55:47.960 --> 2:55:52.320]  terrorizing the entire planet because no one would change our whole way of life
[2:55:52.320 --> 2:55:56.880]  across the world if it wasn't I couldn't do that therefore no one else could do
[2:55:56.880 --> 2:56:01.880]  that or would do that that's how we think that's why psychopaths can and
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:05.760]  have proven down through history that they can do these incredible things and
[2:56:05.760 --> 2:56:12.120]  get away with it they do intuitively like a certain species of animal they
[2:56:12.120 --> 2:56:17.080]  know how the average person thinks how to manipulate the mind that's a gift that
[2:56:17.080 --> 2:56:21.600]  all psychopaths have they're born with this gift no one has been able to explain
[2:56:21.600 --> 2:56:25.640]  why but I think it's a very true to be honest with you they understand the
[2:56:25.640 --> 2:56:30.600]  basic thinking patterns in nature of ordinary people they don't feel what
[2:56:30.600 --> 2:56:35.000]  you feel but they study you they watch your emotions and how you interact and
[2:56:35.000 --> 2:56:39.400]  they know perfectly well intuitively that they can literally manipulate us
[2:56:39.400 --> 2:56:45.200]  another it is a predatory subclass it's what is about one hundred people is a
[2:56:45.200 --> 2:56:51.840]  psychopath and it's a predatory mutation or or or class it's a it's a
[2:56:51.840 --> 2:56:57.760]  homo sapien sapien that engages in feeding and predatory activities on its own
[2:56:57.760 --> 2:57:03.040]  species it is a cannibalistic psychic vampire it is and it is a fit as
[2:57:03.040 --> 2:57:08.160]  certain traits they're almost yes they have the ability to say understand how
[2:57:08.160 --> 2:57:13.480]  you think how you feel and how especially to manipulate an individual or
[2:57:13.480 --> 2:57:18.720]  whole masses of people but that's the talent that don't have to get no work
[2:57:18.720 --> 2:57:22.920]  on it's hereditary with them at all Hitler had it too he knew how to change
[2:57:22.920 --> 2:57:27.120]  the mentality of entire nation by saying a lot of the right things at the time
[2:57:27.120 --> 2:57:31.560]  to get them on board but always having another agenda another vision of where
[2:57:31.560 --> 2:57:36.400]  it was going to take them well take Dick Cheney to saying torture is good and
[2:57:36.400 --> 2:57:40.000]  then when they get caught saying we didn't do torture and then relabeling
[2:57:40.000 --> 2:57:45.040]  torture as just interrogation and then now they say by the way the police are
[2:57:45.040 --> 2:57:50.560]  now going to torture you I mean that's in the news federal court ruling state
[2:57:50.560 --> 2:57:55.200]  courts are saying and then look at how in just seven years our journey to the
[2:57:55.200 --> 2:57:59.520]  dark side is nearing complete yes and look at all the media entertainment
[2:57:59.520 --> 2:58:06.440]  under the guise of drama to train the public that the torture is okay we've
[2:58:06.440 --> 2:58:10.840]  had years of this training through fictional works that seem very real
[2:58:10.840 --> 2:58:15.160]  to the person who gets absorbed in them this is all assigned to be used on the
[2:58:15.160 --> 2:58:20.480]  public there is no safe entertainment out there Alan stay with us for another

[3:00:11.360 --> 3:00:14.760]  Alan watt and I want to take your calls and I want to talk about all this me and
[3:00:14.760 --> 3:00:17.560]  Ellen we're just talking about during the break about how I'd like to meet him
[3:00:17.560 --> 3:00:21.040]  sometime but I'm not allowed to go to Canada there's no law or rule I just get
[3:00:21.040 --> 3:00:26.800]  arrested about trying to go and then the UK papers are announcing only absolute
[3:00:26.800 --> 3:00:33.400]  the term they use is what's the term travel that that that is essential will
[3:00:33.400 --> 3:00:38.800]  be allowed under the new greenhouse gas caps and it's all it's all happening
[3:00:38.800 --> 3:00:41.760]  the minister of the environment came out and said that eventually even all
[3:00:41.760 --> 3:00:47.040]  tourism will be but gone authorized travel for big business purposes
[3:00:47.040 --> 3:00:51.000]  international corporations government only but the environmentalists

[3:00:55.600 --> 3:01:00.320]  mean what sickening degenerate control freaks let's talk to Lillian North
[3:01:00.320 --> 3:01:05.360]  Carolina little you're on the air with Alan watt hey alex I'm just want to say
[3:01:05.360 --> 3:01:11.480]  I listen to your show every day for the latest thing anyway I just want to say
[3:01:11.480 --> 3:01:16.720]  that it's hard to wake people up and take until you tell them you know they
[3:01:16.720 --> 3:01:21.000]  don't want to believe the government is so evil but anyway all the governments
[3:01:21.000 --> 3:01:25.400]  of the world that's because they haven't studied history well they need to read
[3:01:25.400 --> 3:01:31.960]  the general chronology of events put out by leading edge research group it's
[3:01:31.960 --> 3:01:36.360]  fantastic it goes back and tells you all about the eugenics plans
[3:01:36.360 --> 3:01:42.000]  sterilization in the sanitariums and it it even tells you about what they're
[3:01:42.000 --> 3:01:47.440]  going to teach in schools and divide the one-room classroom it's fantastic if
[3:01:47.440 --> 3:01:51.320]  they could read this they could they would understand just how much evil is
[3:01:51.320 --> 3:01:57.120]  out there around them no I hear you in the government not just in the government
[3:01:57.120 --> 3:02:01.200]  around them well no no they have NGOs the corporations it's all one one
[3:02:01.200 --> 3:02:06.080]  thing and they have non-governmental organizations carrying it out thank you
[3:02:06.080 --> 3:02:11.840]  Lily yeah Alan could comment on that I mean these NGOs in the US and England
[3:02:11.840 --> 3:02:16.880]  Canada they all manage local homeland security it's private groups like city
[3:02:16.880 --> 3:02:21.080]  year that answer to the president but they're under a private corporation with
[3:02:21.080 --> 3:02:27.280]  David Gergen in red and black uniforms yes we're once again it said at the top
[3:02:27.280 --> 3:02:31.480]  a long time ago and my great that shared did admit this on national television
[3:02:31.480 --> 3:02:35.240]  Britain she belongs to a power of government they run along with the
[3:02:35.240 --> 3:02:38.960]  foundations the big foundations are the power of government masters they're
[3:02:38.960 --> 3:02:43.760]  also the top bankers like the Rockefellers and they finance the NGOs
[3:02:43.760 --> 3:02:49.080]  that appear to speak on behalf of the general public that that's a trick of
[3:02:49.080 --> 3:02:54.000]  it is a very clever 180 degree manipulation of democracy they don't
[3:02:54.000 --> 3:02:58.040]  speak for the public to take their orders from the foundations and that is
[3:02:58.040 --> 3:03:02.360]  copied after the Soviet system so they meant ruled by councils the Politburo
[3:03:02.360 --> 3:03:06.360]  picked the leaders of the NGOs for the Soviet Union they would demand certain
[3:03:06.360 --> 3:03:11.360]  and more than that more than that it creates an illusion of local business
[3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:16.440]  and government and industry when really it's all their chosen facade for
[3:03:16.440 --> 3:03:20.880]  society and then they'll come in and burn you out now a lot of these NGO groups
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:24.640]  literally this is in the news they're just taking over everything this is their
[3:03:24.640 --> 3:03:28.000]  boots on the ground they know how to make it quote free market like take the
[3:03:28.000 --> 3:03:32.360]  surveillance industry the surveillance industry they all you know the
[3:03:32.360 --> 3:03:36.920]  corporate government with a revolving door gives themselves the contracts for
[3:03:36.920 --> 3:03:38.600]  the police state
[3:03:38.600 --> 3:03:40.680]  that's how it works it's all
[3:03:40.680 --> 3:03:42.760]  it's incredible organization
[3:03:42.760 --> 3:03:45.960]  to see that the capstone is a very good to the emblem
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:49.520]  because everything that is the pyramid as well as the capstone in charge of all
[3:03:49.520 --> 3:03:53.800]  sites if you don't have permitted all sites all four sites
[3:03:53.800 --> 3:03:57.480]  you are in charge of the entire direction of the planet
[3:03:57.480 --> 3:04:00.160]  and that they certainly have not this for a long time
[3:04:00.160 --> 3:04:03.680]  these are the same guys who gave the Soviet system the experiment they called
[3:04:03.680 --> 3:04:04.560]  it
[3:04:04.560 --> 3:04:07.960]  uh... these are the guys who set up the foundations like forward and said
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:12.640]  the purpose of forward was to blame the Soviet system with the culture america
[3:04:12.640 --> 3:04:15.880]  carefully and slowly that wouldn't even know it had been done till it was
[3:04:15.880 --> 3:04:17.160]  merged together
[3:04:17.160 --> 3:04:19.080]  absolutely out of the re-commission
[3:04:19.080 --> 3:04:22.000]  this is all admitted documented history
[3:04:22.000 --> 3:04:26.160]  there have almost reached that goal but it's still need to cooperation and the
[3:04:26.160 --> 3:04:30.760]  fear is done through fear of the general public to go along with every step of it
[3:04:30.760 --> 3:04:33.880]  they're using panic right now panic after panic
[3:04:33.880 --> 3:04:37.440]  and inoculations are next part of the panic
[3:04:37.440 --> 3:04:40.040]  oh i meant to get into that i'll tell you what alan

[3:04:49.160 --> 3:04:51.800]  it is genetically manufactured it is the government
[3:04:51.800 --> 3:04:54.600]  and they as much as admit they're using it as a beta test
[3:04:54.600 --> 3:04:58.000]  but when they really release a controlled flag and then max keiser's

[3:08:29.200 --> 3:08:34.520]  alan watt in closing you were mentioning the swine flu being a staged
[3:08:34.520 --> 3:08:37.720]  fear mongering event it has now come out as we predicted that it was
[3:08:37.720 --> 3:08:41.560]  manufactured man-made manufactured we knew that because it had no connection
[3:08:41.560 --> 3:08:46.200]  to any known natural strain they're obsessed with setting precedence to force
[3:08:46.200 --> 3:08:50.000]  things into our body we know worldwide they've been caught sterilizing and
[3:08:50.000 --> 3:08:53.400]  killing people with vaccines hundreds of times on record with different
[3:08:53.400 --> 3:08:58.600]  vaccines so why would we trust them now to do it with all the atomic soldiers
[3:08:58.600 --> 3:09:02.920]  and all the sterilized kids and all the tetanus shots with sterilization
[3:09:02.920 --> 3:09:08.800]  compounds go ahead yes and remember to these vaccines etc can be a trigger in
[3:09:08.800 --> 3:09:12.080]  your body that might not activate for a few years and down you go with crippling
[3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:18.000]  diseases or death that's how fine an art by a warfare is this is by a warfare and
[3:09:18.000 --> 3:09:21.640]  you're right enough to talk man at one of the centers of diseases controls
[3:09:21.640 --> 3:09:26.560]  admitted you said this virus was created in a lab however even though the
[3:09:26.560 --> 3:09:31.240]  symptoms really are very mild compared to the regular flu it's almost like
[3:09:31.240 --> 3:09:36.520]  having a head cold for a day or two the panic factor is working because people
[3:09:36.520 --> 3:09:40.760]  are flooding all emergency clinics each time the baby has a sniffle or someone
[3:09:40.760 --> 3:09:44.240]  gets an allergy or hay fever that they're overloading the hospitals give
[3:09:44.240 --> 3:09:50.560]  this impression of terror and fear and we try to the the masters to help us we
[3:09:50.560 --> 3:09:55.520]  we go back to the abuser to help us and to save us that's the standard technique
[3:09:55.520 --> 3:10:00.760]  and the statistics system as we're trained into yeah trains everybody to be
[3:10:00.760 --> 3:10:04.840]  hypochondriacs to go to the government to take your shots and magically they're
[3:10:04.840 --> 3:10:08.440]  going to have the new shot for you ready in the fall and winter when the world
[3:10:08.440 --> 3:10:11.840]  health organization the eugenics organization says it's going to come
[3:10:11.840 --> 3:10:17.080]  kill all of us I mean this is ridiculous even though they admit that the virus
[3:10:17.080 --> 3:10:22.240]  keeps taking DNA from every victim so every time it passes on to the next
[3:10:22.240 --> 3:10:26.840]  victim it's an altered virus so technically you cannot have an antidote to
[3:10:26.840 --> 3:10:31.880]  it yeah they admit they never have a flu vaccine that works right but the
[3:10:31.880 --> 3:10:35.920]  public doesn't know that I mean it's just really the globalists are just
[3:10:35.920 --> 3:10:40.720]  generational con artists and psychopaths that all intermarry and figure out new
[3:10:40.720 --> 3:10:44.840]  ways to screw the gullible sweet public I mean it just gets more and more
[3:10:44.840 --> 3:10:49.400]  insane well Ellen what we've already set you back up for July 1st for two
[3:10:49.400 --> 3:10:55.160]  hours at high noon central 1 p.m. Eastern I look forward to talking to you

[3:11:10.840 --> 3:11:19.760]  radio host BBC TV show presenter on the economy Huffington Post writer Max

[3:11:41.000 --> 3:11:45.520]  and joining us to give us his perspective on the economy and where this
[3:11:45.520 --> 3:11:52.480]  insanity this looting is going is Max Kaiser from Paris welcome Max
[3:11:52.480 --> 3:11:57.160]  hey Alex how's it going thanks for coming on my show this past week it's on
[3:11:57.160 --> 3:12:02.560]  the web it's on the net now people want to check it out you bet Max Kaiser.com
[3:12:02.560 --> 3:12:06.440]  Max so much is going on I'm gonna try to sit back until the next break and I've
[3:12:06.440 --> 3:12:10.080]  got more questions and just I'm gonna I'm gonna ask questions what is most
[3:12:10.080 --> 3:12:18.640]  important what is coming out of Max Kaiser's brain first okay well I think
[3:12:18.640 --> 3:12:23.600]  you just have to read the financial news and you get a good idea of you know
[3:12:23.600 --> 3:12:28.000]  what we can expect what's going on just to go back if you remember back in the
[3:12:28.000 --> 3:12:35.720]  1999 period that was when they repealed the Glass-Steagall Act which was in
[3:12:35.720 --> 3:12:39.840]  place since the Depression to keep banks and brokers from getting each other's
[3:12:39.840 --> 3:12:44.360]  business and that was one of the the firewalls that kept the economy from
[3:12:44.360 --> 3:12:49.480]  becoming overly speculative and keeping the Ponzi schemes that were alive in
[3:12:49.480 --> 3:12:54.360]  the 20s to prevent them from coming back on-stream well that was repealed in
[3:12:54.360 --> 3:13:03.560]  1999 with the Greenspan of course then in April 2004 Greenspan and the SEC they
[3:13:03.560 --> 3:13:08.440]  allowed the banks to change their what's called the capital ratios the amount of
[3:13:08.440 --> 3:13:14.200]  assets that they keep on the books versus loans it was for every dollar in
[3:13:14.200 --> 3:13:18.680]  assets they could make roughly $12 in loans they changed that so that for every
[3:13:18.680 --> 3:13:24.800]  dollar in assets they could make $30 in loans so it allowed the banks to keep a
[3:13:24.800 --> 3:13:29.400]  lot less capital on hand it allowed them to do what we call structured finance
[3:13:29.400 --> 3:13:35.640]  that allowed them to get involved in the global Ponzi scheme that eventually in
[3:13:35.640 --> 3:13:42.760]  2006 and 2007 blew up which caused the current crisis that we're still still
[3:13:42.760 --> 3:13:47.160]  dealing with so that brings us all the way up to the present and in the
[3:13:47.160 --> 3:13:54.280]  present just to give you an idea of you know how the the rules and how the
[3:13:54.280 --> 3:13:58.920]  accounting rules is basically the the crisis if you look out in terms of just
[3:13:58.920 --> 3:14:04.240]  how the accounting rules are are you are misused you get a sense of pretty much
[3:14:04.240 --> 3:14:09.880]  that's where the source of all of the fraud takes place so here you have just
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:17.840]  on April 2nd accounting rules for banks came back into effect which allows them
[3:14:17.840 --> 3:14:27.600]  to avoid having to value on their books the the true value of these busted
[3:14:27.600 --> 3:14:33.640]  securities and busted bonds of the so-called mark-to-market standard so
[3:14:33.640 --> 3:14:37.960]  in other words if you had a bond on your on your bank's book and it had dropped
[3:14:37.960 --> 3:14:44.880]  by 80 or 90 or 95 percent value you don't have to declare that in fact has
[3:14:44.880 --> 3:14:50.200]  dropped that much in value what you do is you determine that the according to a
[3:14:50.200 --> 3:14:54.800]  computer model the value of that security might be worth something in the
[3:14:54.800 --> 3:14:59.200]  future it may be under certain conditions the so-called mark the model
[3:14:59.200 --> 3:15:05.760]  method and since they allow that to be imposed to be enforced you've got
[3:15:05.760 --> 3:15:13.680]  situations for example where city group they just came out and they said
[3:15:13.680 --> 3:15:20.000]  thanks to these changes city group was able to book a billion dollars in
[3:15:20.000 --> 3:15:23.600]  gains for the quarter when in fact they're sitting on billions of dollars
[3:15:23.600 --> 3:15:29.120]  of losses and it goes right down the right down the line well Fargo of
[3:15:29.120 --> 3:15:32.720]  course that's a more situation that's Warren Buffett's one of his big holdings
[3:15:32.720 --> 3:15:40.680]  and so what this is all leading up to Alex is another leg of the banking
[3:15:40.680 --> 3:15:47.920]  meltdown so we only had really the first the first leg which started in the
[3:15:47.920 --> 3:15:53.320]  summer of 2007 that last about eight you know up until recently and during that
[3:15:53.320 --> 3:15:58.160]  period of time they the banks of course are totally connected through Goldman
[3:15:58.160 --> 3:16:04.600]  Sachs and and Tim Geithner and all the Goldman Sachs ex alumni and and the
[3:16:04.600 --> 3:16:08.280]  Robert Rubens and all these guys to the revolving door between the federal
[3:16:08.280 --> 3:16:12.200]  government and Goldman Sachs they were able to get the government to give them
[3:16:12.200 --> 3:16:17.360]  tens of billions hundreds of billions trillions of dollars fresh IOUs
[3:16:17.360 --> 3:16:25.000]  fresh commitment from the U.S. taxpayer to make whole all of the bad bets that
[3:16:25.000 --> 3:16:30.040]  they had made that have gone bust and now that that was globally in sconce
[3:16:30.040 --> 3:16:36.360]  behind the you know what with that bailout money and now that they have
[3:16:36.360 --> 3:16:39.920]  manipulated the market over the past couple of months and booked incredible
[3:16:39.920 --> 3:16:44.240]  gains through accounting tricks through manipulating the bank stocks you know the
[3:16:44.240 --> 3:16:49.240]  bank stocks the win-win the hangpaw for them and guide there were threatening to
[3:16:49.240 --> 3:16:53.720]  implode the system unless they got that bailout money yeah back in early October
[3:16:53.720 --> 3:16:58.960]  directly into the pocket of insiders and executives it never really has filtered
[3:16:58.960 --> 3:17:04.560]  out into the general economy at all so this is the first leg the bankers have
[3:17:04.560 --> 3:17:08.600]  been taken care of now we're getting ready for the second leg so the second
[3:17:08.600 --> 3:17:14.200]  major leg of the belt of the banking meltdown is now getting ready to start
[3:17:14.200 --> 3:17:19.160]  over the next you know short term so this is and we're already seeing it in
[3:17:19.160 --> 3:17:23.920]  countries around the world like in Latvia for example which is a client of
[3:17:23.920 --> 3:17:28.600]  many of these banks on Wall Street they are undergoing a major currency
[3:17:28.600 --> 3:17:33.640]  crisis as we speak they are infecting it's a huge contagion they're infecting
[3:17:33.640 --> 3:17:38.000]  the Swedish banks once the Swedish banks have renationalized their banking
[3:17:38.000 --> 3:17:41.280]  system a part of their banking system they not they completely nationalize
[3:17:41.280 --> 3:17:46.360]  their system back in 1993 that will send a contagion to Western European banks
[3:17:46.360 --> 3:17:50.360]  and of course then the contagion will come right back to American banks once
[3:17:50.360 --> 3:17:55.040]  again and I predict that by the end of the year all these banks to go back to
[3:17:55.040 --> 3:18:00.200]  Congress and demand another 10 12 15 trillion in additional bailout money
[3:18:00.200 --> 3:18:08.520]  and then this will be really when the total impact of the entire crisis
[3:18:08.520 --> 3:18:15.480]  fully hit because at that point it'll become quite obvious that the the
[3:18:15.480 --> 3:18:20.640]  currency the paper currency that has fueled this fraud for for decades is
[3:18:20.640 --> 3:18:26.960]  truly worthless and that's when you see this inflation that I've been talking
[3:18:26.960 --> 3:18:32.120]  about another another guess on your show max that was my max that was my next
[3:18:32.120 --> 3:18:36.760]  question and let's get into that now 14.8 trillion according to Bloomberg in
[3:18:36.760 --> 3:18:40.720]  the first seven months and we haven't got any new numbers in the last month
[3:18:40.720 --> 3:18:45.240]  10 trillion in the rest of the world of taxpayer money that we have to pay
[3:18:45.240 --> 3:18:50.240]  interest on to give the bankers offshore now we're paying in bailout money to
[3:18:50.240 --> 3:18:55.960]  move GM to China and to Brazil and Russia the public doesn't even understand
[3:18:55.960 --> 3:19:01.160]  that along with the pensions going bye-bye basically Obama saying he's
[3:19:01.160 --> 3:19:07.360]  going to balance the budget and all this delusional clap trap and what is this
[3:19:07.360 --> 3:19:11.000]  going to do to the currency you got Geithner getting laughed at I mean this
[3:19:11.000 --> 3:19:16.760]  is crazy yeah well we talked about the currency situation a couple of days
[3:19:16.760 --> 3:19:23.560]  ago and the US dollar of course is the World Reserve currency and it has an
[3:19:23.560 --> 3:19:28.840]  interesting role in this global meltdown because every time you find that
[3:19:28.840 --> 3:19:33.920]  there is a huge let's say crisis overseas there's a knee-jerk reaction
[3:19:33.920 --> 3:19:39.720]  where people will slide back into the US dollar temporarily as a safe haven and
[3:19:39.720 --> 3:19:44.040]  then once the smoke clears and they realize that the US is really the
[3:19:44.040 --> 3:19:50.360]  biggest basket case of all the money flows out now over the past 20 years
[3:19:50.360 --> 3:19:55.080]  certainly under Bush one of the ways that the dollar was defended hold on

[3:24:23.920 --> 3:24:28.200]  shift gears in the next segment for listeners to know that I want to talk
[3:24:28.200 --> 3:24:32.040]  about the on-the-ground effects of this well what it's gonna start looking like
[3:24:32.040 --> 3:24:37.320]  on Main Street it's already bleak out there as this deteriorates and what you
[3:24:37.320 --> 3:24:42.120]  politically see in your crystal ball in the future coming out of this not just
[3:24:42.120 --> 3:24:47.600]  in the US but globally you're in Europe go ahead well yeah I'm getting
[3:24:47.600 --> 3:24:51.840]  back to what we were saying before the break and what this is gonna mean you
[3:24:51.840 --> 3:24:57.520]  know what to the day-to-day reality during the bush years the way that the
[3:24:57.520 --> 3:25:03.360]  US was supporting the dollar was they would adjust to you know invade
[3:25:03.360 --> 3:25:09.120]  countries certainly under when the Saddam Hussein started trading his oil in
[3:25:09.120 --> 3:25:14.120]  euros that was one of the the reasons that we know shortly thereafter you
[3:25:14.120 --> 3:25:20.800]  saw shock and awe and bush invading Iraq in Iran they also were talking about
[3:25:20.800 --> 3:25:26.320]  trading their oil in euros and of course the belligerent toward Iran heated up
[3:25:26.320 --> 3:25:31.960]  and it was interesting that the comments were made in the speech this week by
[3:25:31.960 --> 3:25:39.560]  the Obama he mentioned that the the 1953 coup in Iran was in part facilitated by
[3:25:39.560 --> 3:25:43.200]  America CIA which is something that another one of your guests John Perkins
[3:25:43.200 --> 3:25:49.280]  economic hitman has been talking about it in details in his book so it's
[3:25:49.280 --> 3:25:53.520]  interesting that these things are coming to light and it's not on the Alex
[3:25:53.520 --> 3:25:57.000]  Jones show but it's coming from a major address from the president of the United
[3:25:57.000 --> 3:26:00.880]  States up the things that you've been talking about that are really been in
[3:26:00.880 --> 3:26:05.480]  the shadows are now starting to come to light now going forward that so much is
[3:26:05.480 --> 3:26:10.920]  becoming is coming to light because of the work of people like yourself these
[3:26:10.920 --> 3:26:17.360]  banks are going to have to rely more on and more on financial engineering and
[3:26:17.360 --> 3:26:24.000]  financial fraud financial skull duggery and accounting fraud just to get back
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:27.640]  to the little the article I was quoting a moment ago about city group a city
[3:26:27.640 --> 3:26:33.440]  group they reported a 300 they they got 346 billion of capital from the
[3:26:33.440 --> 3:26:39.000]  government and they went on which accounted for 25% of their quarterly net
[3:26:39.000 --> 3:26:45.000]  income and thanks to a rule change and in their accounting and then another 2.7
[3:26:45.000 --> 3:26:48.800]  billion before taxes came from like an accounting rule that left the company
[3:26:48.800 --> 3:26:54.840]  record income when the value of its own debt failed so the company is is trading
[3:26:54.840 --> 3:27:01.160]  with itself and they're buying their own debt and calling it a profit like
[3:27:01.160 --> 3:27:05.320]  treasury and Federal Reserve selling each other debt this is the snake eating
[3:27:05.320 --> 3:27:11.120]  its tail situation so they're in flames calling it record profit in delusion
[3:27:11.120 --> 3:27:15.960]  with idiots buying the stock in the stock market just as delusional it's like
[3:27:15.960 --> 3:27:20.000]  an arsonist getting paid in charcoal
[3:27:21.520 --> 3:27:27.400]  these guys are trading with themselves that so they're ramping up the
[3:27:27.400 --> 3:27:31.760]  accounting fraud because the era of the bush era you know bush was very simple
[3:27:31.760 --> 3:27:34.880]  you know he's a very simple programmer to defend the dollar we're going to go
[3:27:34.880 --> 3:27:39.240]  invade a country and kill a lot of people but that era is over now we're
[3:27:39.240 --> 3:27:43.000]  going to we're entering an era of more of this accounting fraud and financial
[3:27:43.000 --> 3:27:47.520]  engineering so the what that that means to the people on the street people and
[3:27:47.520 --> 3:27:52.360]  in their day-to-day lives that you're going to see more volatility you're
[3:27:52.360 --> 3:27:57.000]  going to see the prices of things on various markets around the world up and
[3:27:57.000 --> 3:28:01.480]  down going to become more volatile to the point point point point I'm sorry
[3:28:01.480 --> 3:28:06.640]  Pogo sticking yeah more of this Pogo stick actions so the marked stock market
[3:28:06.640 --> 3:28:11.080]  bond market precious metal market commodity markets you're going to see a
[3:28:11.080 --> 3:28:16.320]  lot more what you would call beta a lot more volatility a lot more action a lot
[3:28:16.320 --> 3:28:21.080]  more ups and downs and a little more of a rollercoaster ride which of course is
[3:28:21.080 --> 3:28:27.040]  is great if you're on the inside like a Goldman Sachs banker you know or someone
[3:28:27.040 --> 3:28:31.360]  who's on the inside of Wall Street who knows how to have experience and they
[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:36.240]  can profit from this volatility but for most people it's scary and they're on
[3:28:36.240 --> 3:28:40.200]  this rollercoaster of volatility with prices of the markets are going up and
[3:28:40.200 --> 3:28:43.960]  down in a hugely exaggerated way and that's going to kill Main Street is it
[3:28:43.960 --> 3:28:48.400]  not that's going to kill Main Street further well it yeah it'll it'll keep
[3:28:48.400 --> 3:28:54.200]  people it will force people in the lowest possible return investments because
[3:28:54.200 --> 3:28:58.520]  they are perceived as safe but of course those investments are are merely the
[3:28:58.520 --> 3:29:03.840]  feeder funds for the big profitable trades that are done on Wall Street so
[3:29:03.840 --> 3:29:08.440]  they're going to buy government bonds quarantined if you will their
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:12.720]  investments are going to be in these into the making one half of one percent
[3:29:12.720 --> 3:29:16.520]  meanwhile inflation will be raging but they'll be so frightened to put their
[3:29:16.520 --> 3:29:20.080]  any capital to work in something that might benefit it from inflation like
[3:29:20.080 --> 3:29:24.000]  precious metals or commodities because the volatility be so outrageous they're
[3:29:24.000 --> 3:29:27.040]  going to be they're going to be a powering in the corner with their half a
[3:29:27.040 --> 3:29:31.320]  percent or one percent CD and meanwhile the professionals on Wall Street are
[3:29:31.320 --> 3:29:35.280]  going to be racking up twenty thirty forty percent annual gains by gaming the
[3:29:35.280 --> 3:29:38.840]  system and taking advantage of this incredible because that's where the
[3:29:38.840 --> 3:29:41.880]  money is is when things are going up and down because they're engineering it
[3:29:41.880 --> 3:29:45.320]  they know how to place the bets because the dice are totally loaded long
[3:29:45.320 --> 3:29:49.160]  segment coming up with Max Kaiser and your calls max tell us more about what

[3:35:51.040 --> 3:35:58.560]  last 30 minutes earlier today it came out there's a 190 cosponsors to audit the
[3:35:58.560 --> 3:36:04.920]  private Fed people go abolish it first Ron Paul's a trader Ron Paul has a pill
[3:36:04.920 --> 3:36:08.480]  to abolish the private fellow reserve but he figured out a few years ago the
[3:36:08.480 --> 3:36:12.480]  best way to do it is to demand an audit which everybody wants to know the public
[3:36:12.480 --> 3:36:15.720]  congress always ask Bernanke where's the money he laughs at him and says I'm
[3:36:15.720 --> 3:36:19.520]  above the law Greenspan goes on Lair news hour and says that it's in the
[3:36:19.520 --> 3:36:23.200]  Obama deception you know saying they're above the law so this is something has
[3:36:23.200 --> 3:36:27.280]  a chance to pass see see if we can get the door open off the castle we can go
[3:36:27.280 --> 3:36:31.680]  in and throw the throw the bums out we got to blow the door off the hinges
[3:36:31.680 --> 3:36:37.240]  first that's what this is okay so this is reality we're moving forward we're
[3:36:37.240 --> 3:36:41.200]  having a shot at this at winning but what does the fellow reserve do well I'm
[3:36:41.200 --> 3:36:45.480]  gonna tell you the Fed has sent out tens of thousands of bureaucrats they are
[3:36:45.480 --> 3:36:49.080]  paying school teachers and professors from every major university I know of
[3:36:49.080 --> 3:36:53.720]  right here in Texas I see it in the news they pay the university's grants and pay
[3:36:53.720 --> 3:36:59.440]  thousands of dollars a year to bring the professors in to pay them to go out and
[3:36:59.440 --> 3:37:02.880]  teach the federal reserves good the bailouts good the banker takeover is
[3:37:02.880 --> 3:37:06.760]  good because they're engaged in a coup through north com but not just of the
[3:37:06.760 --> 3:37:10.720]  US of the world they admit it's a new bank of the world run by them we pay
[3:37:10.720 --> 3:37:16.760]  carbon taxes to so that intends to hire lobbyist and campaign the buttress its
[3:37:16.760 --> 3:37:20.440]  image not only do they have these armies of lobbyists they're paying on the
[3:37:20.440 --> 3:37:24.440]  grassroots they now are saying in Bloomberg oh they're gonna lobby to fix
[3:37:24.440 --> 3:37:29.680]  their image in Congress bull you read deeper it's the lobby against being
[3:37:29.680 --> 3:37:35.240]  audited in HR 1207 they've never been audited they have a fake audit where they
[3:37:35.240 --> 3:37:38.560]  audit the chairs and pencils but not where the money goes and Obama promised
[3:37:38.560 --> 3:37:41.840]  every dime of the bailout and every dime of the stimulus would be accounted
[3:37:41.840 --> 3:37:46.480]  for now it's a state secret so the people that ran Bush run Obama max
[3:37:46.480 --> 3:37:50.960]  Kaiser Federal Reserve intends to hire a veteran lobbyist and seeks to counter
[3:37:50.960 --> 3:37:54.640]  skepticism in Congress about the central banks growing power over the US
[3:37:54.640 --> 3:37:57.960]  financial system now they tried the mind trick of saying we're above the law
[3:37:57.960 --> 3:38:02.720]  Mount Olympus in the clouds you mere mortals are down there now Congress is
[3:38:02.720 --> 3:38:07.880]  is is becoming contemptuous of the godlike criminal bankers now their
[3:38:07.880 --> 3:38:14.560]  facade of infallibility and and and zoosness is evaporating and they're
[3:38:14.560 --> 3:38:19.160]  now dispatching hordes of minions everywhere I think we got a chance to
[3:38:19.160 --> 3:38:28.000]  literally arrest these bastards max Kaiser what say ye well you know the
[3:38:28.000 --> 3:38:33.120]  thing is if you audit the Fed you know it's the same thing as abolishing the
[3:38:33.120 --> 3:38:38.640]  Fed because there's nothing in the Fed the Fed has swapped all of their
[3:38:38.640 --> 3:38:42.800]  treasury paper for all this worthless toxic assets that we've been talking
[3:38:42.800 --> 3:38:49.040]  about that they are trying to quote mark the market and give a fictional value
[3:38:49.040 --> 3:38:54.960]  to but if you actually do a Ron Paul style audit and apply real value you
[3:38:54.960 --> 3:39:00.080]  will find that the value is zero so by ordering the Fed it's the same thing as
[3:39:00.080 --> 3:39:05.280]  abolishing the Fed because the Fed has nothing now I tell you something that is
[3:39:05.280 --> 3:39:12.080]  very interesting Alex Jones the Fed of course and the treasury are the
[3:39:12.080 --> 3:39:19.560]  purveyors of us treasury bond it is a well-known fact within the banking
[3:39:19.560 --> 3:39:25.080]  circles that for many years the big banks on the street Goldman Sachs JP
[3:39:25.080 --> 3:39:31.480]  Morgan have sold treasury bonds that they had no authority to do so that they
[3:39:31.480 --> 3:39:37.400]  have in fact counterfeited those bonds or sold short naked naked short selling
[3:39:37.400 --> 3:39:42.320]  of treasury bonds that do not actually exist if you're gonna audit the Fed
[3:39:42.320 --> 3:39:46.880]  you that means you're gonna have to audit the New York Fed where Geithner
[3:39:46.880 --> 3:39:50.280]  was before he joined the Treasury Department yeah that's the head of the
[3:39:50.280 --> 3:39:54.480]  snake for those that don't know and if you're gonna do that then you've got to
[3:39:54.480 --> 3:39:59.880]  also pursue this all the way to the fact and you know I don't want to you know
[3:39:59.880 --> 3:40:05.320]  blow your head off or anything but the all the records for the FCC to account
[3:40:05.320 --> 3:40:11.040]  for all these naked short building seven that's right I'm afraid they were blown
[3:40:11.040 --> 3:40:19.000]  up oh that's where that's where it all goes that's where the FCC all those
[3:40:19.000 --> 3:40:24.680]  records are in we're in that depository and you know as I've always said since
[3:40:24.680 --> 3:40:31.640]  912 that the Twin Towers were merely merely a cover for the target the true
[3:40:31.640 --> 3:40:37.040]  target that day where those SEC records that were held in in building seven now
[3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:39.720]  something else that's interesting let me stop you I've noticed the elites
[3:40:39.720 --> 3:40:44.320]  pathologically love to do things that help them on win win win win win insurance
[3:40:44.320 --> 3:40:47.480]  fraud be able to invade countries police state but but you're absolutely
[3:40:47.480 --> 3:40:52.640]  right so but what I'm saying is people will find out it's only a front for the
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:40:57.920]  private Federal Reserve owner banks and families and all the scams exactly if
[3:40:57.920 --> 3:41:01.760]  you're able to ever audit them and and even trying to audit them and them
[3:41:01.760 --> 3:41:06.400]  fighting and covering up and acting suspicious Ron Paul said on the show he
[3:41:06.400 --> 3:41:10.480]  knows his life is in danger doing this and then meanwhile our whining pathetic
[3:41:10.480 --> 3:41:14.640]  patriot movement winds and bitches that he isn't doing enough I mean it's just
[3:41:14.640 --> 3:41:19.000]  mental illness but sorry max go ahead well if I build what do you know he says
[3:41:19.000 --> 3:41:23.080]  Doc my brother thinks he's a chicken what what what do you think we should do
[3:41:23.080 --> 3:41:28.520]  about it and he said well you know take these drugs and he'll stop thinking as
[3:41:28.520 --> 3:41:39.440]  a chicken but he says but back we need the eggs so the lies are are critical to
[3:41:39.440 --> 3:41:44.920]  the the illusionary thinking now here's something else about the New York Fed
[3:41:44.920 --> 3:41:50.600]  the New York Fed is also where Germany keeps all of its gold and Germany if you
[3:41:50.600 --> 3:41:55.720]  saw it very interesting with Brian Williams I guess his name is on he was
[3:41:55.720 --> 3:41:59.120]  interviewing Obama in the White House and during the meeting Larry Summers
[3:41:59.120 --> 3:42:02.000]  got very excited and came in and said what about the German thing there's a
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:05.560]  Germany the German problem and people are asking what's what's going on with
[3:42:05.560 --> 3:42:10.000]  Germany Merkel is saying we're tired of your crap go ahead well Germany is
[3:42:10.000 --> 3:42:14.720]  demanding that the US sends them back their gold they've got 3,000 tons of
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:18.320]  gold they've got the second or third biggest gold bullion reserve in the
[3:42:18.320 --> 3:42:22.920]  world it's held in in New York in the New York Fed they want to shift back like
[3:42:22.920 --> 3:42:28.040]  France had their gold shipped back in the 70s when Nixon closed the gold window
[3:42:28.040 --> 3:42:34.520]  you know it's part of the the the the the Nixon attempt to pay off the
[3:42:34.520 --> 3:42:38.840]  Vietnam War by printing up a lot of phony money so it appears the Ponzi
[3:42:38.840 --> 3:42:43.000]  scheme is teetering on the on the end of a pen here
[3:42:43.000 --> 3:42:48.600]  that's that's that's what Germany is sensing and they want their gold bullion
[3:42:48.600 --> 3:42:55.000]  back and if that's so then it's less of a reserve that you can you can account
[3:42:55.000 --> 3:43:00.400]  and in your in your accounting model so that's why I say they're going forward
[3:43:00.400 --> 3:43:04.120]  you're gonna have more accounting fraud more accounting tricks if you look at
[3:43:04.120 --> 3:43:08.320]  this story from Bloomberg today creators of finance you have to be okay
[3:43:08.320 --> 3:43:13.280]  it's creators of financial products have been running ahead of the law for many
[3:43:13.280 --> 3:43:18.600]  years okay they're talking about that financial products are being relied on
[3:43:18.600 --> 3:43:23.600]  more and more to try to engineer America out of their problem now you have to
[3:43:23.600 --> 3:43:27.680]  work politics going forward I'll tell you what I think it's gonna happen and we
[3:43:27.680 --> 3:43:31.640]  saw it in the last election you know in the last election the Obama victory
[3:43:31.640 --> 3:43:38.280]  owes a large part to the presence of what we call prediction markets or event
[3:43:38.280 --> 3:43:42.680]  driven markets there was an Irish exchange called in trade where people
[3:43:42.680 --> 3:43:46.920]  are buying and selling and whether or not Obama would become president now
[3:43:46.920 --> 3:43:52.080]  once you own a contract where you think someone's going to be a president
[3:43:52.080 --> 3:43:56.760]  presidential winner you're going to tend to vote for that person so this is a
[3:43:56.760 --> 3:44:00.560]  blending we're going to see of the casino industry with the political
[3:44:00.560 --> 3:44:05.120]  establishment and as more being going forward more and more people are going
[3:44:05.120 --> 3:44:09.680]  to be taking speculative bet vis-a-vis these online betting exchanges and
[3:44:09.680 --> 3:44:12.840]  prediction markets and I know these pretty well because I invented the as you
[3:44:12.840 --> 3:44:17.680]  pointed out at the top of the show I invented the the technology for virtual
[3:44:17.680 --> 3:44:21.080]  betting that went into the Hollywood Stock Exchange and then cancer Fitz
[3:44:21.080 --> 3:44:24.560]  Gerald bought that company they moved it in fact to the top floor of the World
[3:44:24.560 --> 3:44:29.440]  Trade Towers now a few months before 9-11 which is how I know that they were
[3:44:29.440 --> 3:44:35.080]  brokers working in the towers buying puts on airlines based on the rumors
[3:44:35.080 --> 3:44:41.080]  of a plane exploding no betting on their own demise because I know because I
[3:44:41.080 --> 3:44:45.480]  was talking directly to them because they just bought my company but anyway so
[3:44:45.480 --> 3:44:50.720]  these virtual bets and virtual trading platforms are going to be more of a
[3:44:50.720 --> 3:44:55.240]  factor in elections going forward so the politicians instead of trying to
[3:44:55.240 --> 3:45:01.200]  persuade you using commercials and TV and media they're going to try to get you
[3:45:01.200 --> 3:45:06.080]  to buy stock and then to make bets in them so you have a vested interest in
[3:45:06.080 --> 3:45:10.440]  the outcome and so it'll become much more like a casino gambling environment
[3:45:10.440 --> 3:45:15.840]  and this is and people as they lose their job and as wages continue to erode
[3:45:15.840 --> 3:45:20.400]  there's going to be more people who are going to try to make their
[3:45:20.400 --> 3:45:24.120]  living in gambling and gambling is going to become a lot more sophisticated
[3:45:24.120 --> 3:45:27.880]  you're going to see online gambling become legalized in America because it's
[3:45:27.880 --> 3:45:31.960]  going to be a source of huge revenue and many people are going to become more
[3:45:31.960 --> 3:45:35.720]  professional gamblers that's it to replace their manifesto let me stop you
[3:45:35.720 --> 3:45:38.880]  max so what's the way you're going with this is and I agree they're admitting
[3:45:38.880 --> 3:45:43.960]  this is where they're going the all the fiat gambling made up crap toxic
[3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:51.320]  derivatives certified paper you know all of these scams that got us into this
[3:45:51.320 --> 3:45:56.280]  they're saying the answer is diving completely into it and letting the
[3:45:56.280 --> 3:46:01.920]  false casino economy literally take over all of society to where it's just
[3:46:01.920 --> 3:46:06.280]  gambling world with nothing but prostitutes and corrupt police and fat
[3:46:06.280 --> 3:46:11.760]  cats gambling everywhere and bureaucrats ruling over the farms and ranches with
[3:46:11.760 --> 3:46:16.080]  those people literally as slaves producing food for them and then soon
[3:46:16.080 --> 3:46:20.200]  they'll become delusional and make people eat scraps of derivative paper
[3:46:20.200 --> 3:46:25.160]  that symbolize eggs I mean we're just entering into a vortex of mass delusion
[3:46:25.160 --> 3:46:31.280]  well virtual property is already huge business on sites like second life and
[3:46:31.280 --> 3:46:36.320]  other sites where people are buying and selling virtual trinkets and it's a
[3:46:36.320 --> 3:46:40.000]  multi-million multi I think it's approaching a billion dollar industry
[3:46:40.000 --> 3:46:45.680]  now a virtual economics on fiber yeah the new xbox yeah the other false phony
[3:46:45.680 --> 3:46:50.000]  economy is eating the real universe and the new xbox you biometrically scan
[3:46:50.000 --> 3:46:55.120]  yourself in and these kids are like I'm an admiral that rules 75 galaxies in
[3:46:55.120 --> 3:46:59.240]  this planet but the guy can't get a woman look you could do freaks it's not
[3:46:59.240 --> 3:47:05.120]  the real world I'm I'm sorry go ahead Kaiser forced work slave camps it'll be
[3:47:05.120 --> 3:47:10.360]  forced gaming slave camps exactly how you must produce the game so the you know
[3:47:10.360 --> 3:47:14.640]  the the virtual economy so I guess I I would I think that's that's correct
[3:47:14.640 --> 3:47:19.000]  instead of trying to it's not trying to pull back from all the fraud and
[3:47:19.000 --> 3:47:23.200]  accounting and all of the speculation there's gonna be a massive push to make
[3:47:23.200 --> 3:47:28.440]  it even more retail more established and to break it down into more of a
[3:47:28.440 --> 3:47:33.280]  micro payment situation to pump it into the new bubble but yeah that the new
[3:47:33.280 --> 3:47:37.800]  bubble is going to be driven by micro the micro payment schemes you know
[3:47:37.800 --> 3:47:42.360]  anybody with the micro loans getting everybody into long loan sharking
[3:47:42.360 --> 3:47:47.560]  bubbles and then selling the loan shark derivatives well we're seeing it already
[3:47:47.560 --> 3:47:50.440]  in the commodity markets you know the commodity markets there's their
[3:47:50.440 --> 3:47:55.520]  packaging right now collateralized commodity obligation because of the
[3:47:55.520 --> 3:47:58.360]  couple of the collateralized debt obligations of course that market is
[3:47:58.360 --> 3:48:01.760]  dried up and they're also betting that I mean that I mean you know this max
[3:48:01.760 --> 3:48:05.200]  they're saying the holy grail that will save us will be the carbon credits that
[3:48:05.200 --> 3:48:09.960]  shuts down real industry but then you pay Al Gore your carbon indulgence like
[3:48:09.960 --> 3:48:14.800]  you're buying it from st. Peter's Basilica to just get your mother out of
[3:48:14.800 --> 3:48:20.880]  hell well I've written a lot about carbon credits and the problem is that the
[3:48:20.880 --> 3:48:26.440]  government are not strict in their allocation of credits and they and so
[3:48:26.440 --> 3:48:30.520]  that market is becoming as corrupt as any other market you know markets
[3:48:30.520 --> 3:48:35.040]  there's nothing wrong with markets per se if people follow the rules but since
[3:48:35.040 --> 3:48:38.560]  the people who make money markets by politicians and then they change the
[3:48:38.560 --> 3:48:43.600]  rules it becomes as you have a story on your site today called neo medievalism
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:50.200]  or neo feudalism and it's it's basically shows that the ads profits that are
[3:48:50.200 --> 3:48:54.720]  made in capitalism are used to buy politicians and these politicians are
[3:48:54.720 --> 3:49:00.120]  then basically abdicating their role as public servants and just changing the
[3:49:00.120 --> 3:49:04.080]  rules to make it easier to make more speculative profits you go back to this
[3:49:04.080 --> 3:49:09.880]  medieval period of gated cities and walled cities with where people are
[3:49:09.880 --> 3:49:14.160]  serving up the gambling trinkets through the internet and everyone else is kind
[3:49:14.160 --> 3:49:19.920]  of living in a no man land you know virtual the wasteland and and that you
[3:49:19.920 --> 3:49:23.760]  see that kind of happening right now and you see it happening with these huge
[3:49:23.760 --> 3:49:28.600]  gaming establishment and I think the big story in the next year as the
[3:49:28.600 --> 3:49:33.260]  economy continues to shrink the online gambling is going to be passed in
[3:49:33.260 --> 3:49:38.360]  America and that's going to open a door to just a Pandora's box of an
[3:49:38.360 --> 3:49:43.440]  incredibly you know all other as you point out as you say it that's going to
[3:49:43.440 --> 3:49:49.520]  be the next bubble I tell you this is going to end the governments are still
[3:49:49.520 --> 3:49:53.000]  investing even more in the stock market now that it's unstable and they're
[3:49:53.000 --> 3:49:57.760]  literally write us tickets on the street and then take the money and invest it in
[3:49:57.760 --> 3:50:01.480]  stock markets and so I guess it's just going to be the sheriff's going to be
[3:50:01.480 --> 3:50:06.280]  shaking the coins out of our pockets so he can go stick it in the in the in the
[3:50:06.280 --> 3:50:08.640]  slot machine of of wall street

[3:55:03.920 --> 3:55:05.600]  about ten percent of texans
[3:55:05.600 --> 3:55:07.200]  having uh...
[3:55:07.200 --> 3:55:10.520]  arrest warrants like google install these news articles i wasn't
[3:55:10.520 --> 3:55:12.920]  actually aware of that when i was on your show and you asked me and it was
[3:55:12.920 --> 3:55:13.880]  approaching that in
[3:55:13.880 --> 3:55:16.720]  some counties it was more like fifteen percent
[3:55:16.720 --> 3:55:20.160]  and uh... they're now giving you tickets for one mile over the speed limit many
[3:55:20.160 --> 3:55:24.800]  areas they're just they admit they're going to do all their budget shortfalls
[3:55:24.800 --> 3:55:27.400]  on finding and feeding and
[3:55:27.400 --> 3:55:31.000]  i mean this is just what's gonna happen when people can't pay anymore

[3:55:37.280 --> 3:55:40.880]  what is this coming towards i i see a collision course i see revolution
[3:55:40.880 --> 3:55:43.560]  keiser
[3:55:43.560 --> 3:55:48.720]  yeah well uh... you know the bill the the shake down in texas and around the
[3:55:48.720 --> 3:55:49.920]  country
[3:55:49.920 --> 3:55:54.400]  is is just that all of the rhetoric that was put out there
[3:55:54.400 --> 3:55:57.600]  despite this uh... so-called war on terror
[3:55:57.600 --> 3:56:00.400]  uh... simply put into place the surveillance state
[3:56:00.400 --> 3:56:04.360]  and the surveillance technology to nickle and dying people to death
[3:56:04.360 --> 3:56:08.240]  uh... is that the intention of never to make people more secure the intention
[3:56:08.240 --> 3:56:09.960]  has always been
[3:56:09.960 --> 3:56:11.960]  to shake people down
[3:56:11.960 --> 3:56:15.160]  because they they know that these debts are going to have to be paid
[3:56:15.160 --> 3:56:18.400]  in some way and then just to get back to uh...
[3:56:18.400 --> 3:56:21.320]  what we're saying about the fusion of the political establishment in the
[3:56:21.320 --> 3:56:23.080]  casino business
[3:56:23.080 --> 3:56:26.560]  you know he i can envision now going forward with online gambling becomes
[3:56:26.560 --> 3:56:28.680]  legal in america the necessity
[3:56:28.680 --> 3:56:32.960]  to over to create the new bubble to try to get the economy going again
[3:56:32.960 --> 3:56:34.200]  you have a situation
[3:56:34.200 --> 3:56:36.120]  like well uh... if you remember
[3:56:36.120 --> 3:56:40.960]  during bush when he sent all americans a check for six hundred dollars
[3:56:40.960 --> 3:56:44.200]  and that's part of that part of his one of the first stimulus
[3:56:44.200 --> 3:56:47.960]  packages you know going forward i'll just be there just ended six hundred more
[3:56:47.960 --> 3:56:49.240]  chips
[3:56:49.240 --> 3:56:53.400]  uh... in work at the no-chip and i don't know what they won't be a pretense
[3:56:53.400 --> 3:56:56.520]  that they wanted to go participate in the economy anymore
[3:56:56.520 --> 3:56:59.440]  in the consumer economy anymore because they won't be anything to buy anymore
[3:56:59.440 --> 3:57:01.400]  because it's all going to be gone
[3:57:01.400 --> 3:57:02.920]  but what they do want to do
[3:57:02.920 --> 3:57:05.240]  if they want you to go and speculate
[3:57:05.240 --> 3:57:07.280]  on these online casinos
[3:57:07.280 --> 3:57:10.640]  and i'll give you the chips to do it and as you get to uh...
[3:57:10.640 --> 3:57:12.320]  these uh... elections
[3:57:12.320 --> 3:57:16.200]  uh... you're going to be voting for a weather promises not to give you a low
[3:57:16.200 --> 3:57:17.160]  interest rate
[3:57:17.160 --> 3:57:20.120]  or low home loans or cheaper prices
[3:57:20.120 --> 3:57:23.480]  or they're going to be able to vote for anything more casino chips because
[3:57:23.480 --> 3:57:26.680]  they're all going to be jacked into the online casino world
[3:57:26.680 --> 3:57:28.560]  you know begging for more chips
[3:57:28.560 --> 3:57:30.160]  uh... now you're saying
[3:57:30.160 --> 3:57:32.240]  with their revolution coming
[3:57:32.240 --> 3:57:35.600]  uh... when one of the rep you hear the question for you out of the way i think
[3:57:35.600 --> 3:57:36.480]  you have a question
[3:57:36.480 --> 3:57:37.960]  but we are one minute you
[3:57:37.960 --> 3:57:40.920]  uh... it's very it's very simple question you know i i look into your
[3:57:40.920 --> 3:57:43.640]  show and people come on the show and i think
[3:57:43.640 --> 3:57:45.320]  the second amendment right
[3:57:45.320 --> 3:57:46.400]  gives people
[3:57:46.400 --> 3:57:48.320]  the right to bear arms
[3:57:48.320 --> 3:57:51.960]  and uh... with you go back historically need to do the research on that you
[3:57:51.960 --> 3:57:56.040]  find out that the founding fathers put this in place as a way to give the
[3:57:56.040 --> 3:57:57.200]  population
[3:57:57.200 --> 3:57:58.520]  uh... the militia
[3:57:58.520 --> 3:58:02.280]  so do we have a physical confrontation is that what you're asking me
[3:58:02.280 --> 3:58:05.000]  but the ability to defend against tyranny right
[3:58:05.000 --> 3:58:09.040]  yes that that was it that was a little bit of the risk that the founding fathers
[3:58:09.040 --> 3:58:12.000]  for a song
[3:58:12.000 --> 3:58:13.960]  rolls at a time what's the question
[3:58:13.960 --> 3:58:18.400]  the question is why what are people waiting for it because clearly the
[3:58:18.400 --> 3:58:20.800]  tyranny is now
[3:58:20.800 --> 3:58:25.240]  well there's no doubt the tyranny today is greater than king george the third
[3:58:25.240 --> 3:58:26.560]  it's just that
[3:58:26.560 --> 3:58:30.360]  so what are the people waiting for that
