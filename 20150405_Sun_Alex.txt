[00:00.000 --> 00:06.560]  Welcome my friends, it is Easter on this fifth day of April 2015 and we have a
[00:06.560 --> 00:11.680]  special transmission for you today I guess in radio parlance they would call
[00:11.680 --> 00:15.760]  it a best of but some of it will be original some of the new special
[00:15.760 --> 00:19.760]  reports that have been filed at Info Wars nightly news like the ones you're
[00:19.760 --> 00:23.840]  about to hear here in just a moment and then the amazing interview a few weeks
[00:23.840 --> 00:28.400]  ago with a former technical director of the National Security Agency William
[00:28.400 --> 00:32.640]  Benny then we have Barrett Brown the political prisoner is going to be
[00:32.640 --> 00:35.680]  joining us from prison that interview with David Knight and Paul Joseph
[00:35.680 --> 00:40.400]  Watson very important and then that ties in to Bruce Fine the former head
[00:40.400 --> 00:46.240]  lawyer for the FCC who helped end the fairness doctrine he weighs in on the
[00:46.240 --> 00:50.960]  persecution of journalists and the media and the FCC power grab Daniel Estolin on
[00:50.960 --> 00:55.200]  the latest on Bilderberg we're going to talk to Dr. Andrew Wakefield recently
[00:55.200 --> 00:58.480]  exonerated with the proof of his studies and what vaccines are doing to
[00:58.480 --> 01:04.320]  children and more all this in the next two hours but now this excerpt from
[01:04.320 --> 01:09.520]  Info Wars nightly news then we'll be back after the break
[01:09.520 --> 01:13.360]  yesterday we brought you the news about a mass shooting a campus shooting in
[01:13.360 --> 01:17.600]  Kenya the terrorist group Al Shabbat opened fire at Garissa
[01:17.600 --> 01:23.120]  University College and killed nearly 150 people Fox News reported the men were
[01:23.120 --> 01:26.880]  going door-to-door asking people their religion and if they answered they were
[01:26.880 --> 01:31.120]  a Christian they shot them on the spot the first responders engaged the
[01:31.120 --> 01:35.120]  terrorists but were flat out outgunned Al Shabbat is the same group that
[01:35.120 --> 01:39.200]  attacked a mall in Nairobi years ago killing many innocent people and now
[01:39.200 --> 01:43.360]  they're threatening attacks here on US soil threatening the mall of America
[01:43.360 --> 01:47.600]  DHS has investigated the group and found them to be no credible threat
[01:47.600 --> 01:51.040]  and I hope they're right but if they're wrong I'm very happy that we live in a
[01:51.040 --> 01:54.320]  country where we have concealed carriers
[01:54.320 --> 01:58.800]  he kept pulling the charging handle and hitting the side the break and gun fire
[01:58.800 --> 02:02.880]  allowed mealy to pull out his own gun I saw someone in the back of
[02:02.880 --> 02:07.040]  the charlotte move and I knew that if I fired and missed I could end up hitting
[02:07.040 --> 02:09.440]  them so mealy took cover inside a nearby
[02:09.440 --> 02:12.640]  store I'm not beating myself up because I didn't shoot him
[02:12.640 --> 02:17.760]  but I know that after he saw me though I think the last shot he fired was the
[02:17.760 --> 02:21.120]  one that he used on himself the gunman was dead
[02:21.120 --> 02:24.880]  and in the clack of miss shooting the mere sight of armed opposition forced
[02:24.880 --> 02:28.400]  the gunman to turn the gun upon himself I guess he didn't want to take the
[02:28.400 --> 02:32.080]  chance of being taken alive and now we're all asking the same question how
[02:32.080 --> 02:36.000]  do we combat these mass shootings well the chief of Interpol has come out and
[02:36.000 --> 02:39.440]  said well maybe we should just arm the citizens the people should be able to
[02:39.440 --> 02:42.720]  protect themselves and I do agree now am I trying to put a
[02:42.720 --> 02:47.600]  firearm in every dorm room in America no but if you're somebody of age of sound
[02:47.600 --> 02:51.360]  mind and body and you don't have any criminal proceedings
[02:51.360 --> 02:53.760]  you know I think you should be able to go out and purchase a gun to keep
[02:53.760 --> 02:57.680]  yourself safe but not everybody agrees with this point of view
[02:57.680 --> 03:01.920]  and there are now actually articles out debunking the effectiveness of armed
[03:01.920 --> 03:04.720]  citizens I have some self-defense stories here
[03:04.720 --> 03:08.240]  and for the purposes of this report I restricted this to public people in
[03:08.240 --> 03:11.520]  public places and not private individuals in their homes
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.480]  we'll start with this one back in 2012 two robbers enter an internet cafe once
[03:16.480 --> 03:20.480]  holding a bat the other one has a pistol he jumps up with his own
[03:20.480 --> 03:24.480]  pistol shoots at the robbers and chase them out
[03:24.480 --> 03:28.400]  like the rats that they are you see you've got scary and pretty pathetic
[03:28.400 --> 03:32.000]  but he saved the day now the story from Wisconsin
[03:32.000 --> 03:35.040]  a gentleman pulls out his concealed carry and then shoots this guy once the
[03:35.040 --> 03:39.200]  coast is clear gas station clerk thwarted robbery
[03:39.200 --> 03:42.560]  fired from violating companies no weapons policy so this guy
[03:42.560 --> 03:46.400]  he saved himself from the people in the store but he lost his job unfortunately
[03:46.400 --> 03:49.680]  another story out of philadelphia barbershop
[03:49.680 --> 03:55.440]  patron shoots gunman dead armed robber no match for pharmacist with a 45 and
[03:55.440 --> 03:58.880]  there are videos accompanying most of these articles I'm showing you we're
[03:58.880 --> 04:01.840]  just skipping them for the sake of time but you're welcome to go back and look
[04:01.840 --> 04:06.480]  at them for yourself woman fins off would be attackers with concealed gun
[04:06.480 --> 04:10.480]  and this is a bank employee with a concealed carry shoot would be robber in
[04:10.480 --> 04:14.480]  the jaw another bank story bank customer thwarted robbery
[04:14.480 --> 04:18.400]  after returning to car to grab gun and will end with this one
[04:18.400 --> 04:22.160]  india's first gun for women fairies well among men and this was
[04:22.160 --> 04:26.560]  in response to the deli gang rape of 2012
[04:26.560 --> 04:30.480]  where the young lady was raped on the bus with an iron rod by several attackers
[04:30.480 --> 04:33.440]  and now they have a gun specifically designed for the women I think the gun
[04:33.440 --> 04:36.000]  is way overpriced but I'm happy to see that the
[04:36.000 --> 04:39.120]  young ladies are carrying this nonetheless and are able to defend
[04:39.120 --> 04:42.160]  themselves keep this in mind as we go forward and hopefully
[04:42.160 --> 04:46.320]  we diminish these gun-free zones and get rid of these soft targets
[04:46.320 --> 04:51.680]  you can find more reports on info wars.com

[06:18.160 --> 06:21.600]  eastern broadcast I want to go to our
[06:21.600 --> 06:26.480]  annals here or our archives for a moment not too far back a few weeks ago we had
[06:26.480 --> 06:30.160]  the former technical director of the national security agency a huge
[06:30.160 --> 06:34.400]  whistleblower on the broadcast and he dropped bombshell after bombshell
[06:34.400 --> 06:39.280]  while he was on so here are some of those tidbits of information
[06:39.280 --> 06:42.560]  Mr. Benny is a real hero he'll just say it is duty but
[06:42.560 --> 06:48.320]  in a world of traders someone doing their duty is heroic
[06:48.320 --> 06:52.880]  and he joins us here today William thanks for coming in
[06:52.880 --> 06:57.520]  thanks for having me I don't know where to start we could recap your story
[06:57.520 --> 07:00.480]  what's happening get into the exciting stuff about you coming back from
[07:00.480 --> 07:02.880]  germany you've been talking to parliaments over there
[07:02.880 --> 07:06.480]  you've been talking to the you know EU people the the I believe the British
[07:06.480 --> 07:09.360]  parliament big national headlines where you say it's a
[07:09.360 --> 07:14.080]  totalitarian takeover in the guardian but here it's starting to come out in the
[07:14.080 --> 07:16.640]  news as well I guess they failed to silence you
[07:16.640 --> 07:19.840]  we could talk about you working with Oliver Stone now
[07:19.840 --> 07:24.960]  on the new Snowden documentary we could get into the slides and break down
[07:24.960 --> 07:29.120]  the fact that it is going on from an expert showing us not what's classified
[07:29.120 --> 07:32.480]  but what's already been leaked so you don't get in trouble
[07:32.480 --> 07:36.400]  we're here with the former technical director of the NSA the guy that
[07:36.400 --> 07:39.760]  actually ran it William Benny so you've got the floor sir
[07:39.760 --> 07:42.720]  yeah there's so much here it's really hard to know where to start because
[07:42.720 --> 07:46.960]  it's really been over time it's been our government has moved into
[07:46.960 --> 07:50.400]  basically sliding down the totalitarian slope
[07:50.400 --> 07:54.400]  taking massive amounts of data on our citizens and then working around and
[07:54.400 --> 07:56.880]  doing it across the world so it's basically they're
[07:56.880 --> 08:00.080]  they're doing this for everybody in the planet and and the process started
[08:00.080 --> 08:04.400]  here in the NSA and it started to spread around the world to the five
[08:04.400 --> 08:10.080]  eyes countries the UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand
[08:10.080 --> 08:13.360]  and then to other countries like in Germany and
[08:13.360 --> 08:20.240]  Switzerland and Sweden and Israel so the process of data collection
[08:20.240 --> 08:23.120]  and now the Russians are doing it I just read an article where they're starting
[08:23.120 --> 08:26.640]  this kind of operation so now the Russians are following our lead
[08:26.640 --> 08:29.360]  in this spying business it's a big brother race
[08:29.360 --> 08:34.800]  right this is this is see when I when I first started in October 2001
[08:34.800 --> 08:38.720]  it was very clear to me that this was a process that we were adopting in the
[08:38.720 --> 08:41.760]  United States it was really a Soviet attempt
[08:41.760 --> 08:46.480]  or a stasi attempt in East Germany to to assemble all the information on US on
[08:46.480 --> 08:50.640]  their populations why it's because they wanted to control
[08:50.640 --> 08:52.720]  their populations that was the whole point of the
[08:52.720 --> 08:55.920]  the totalitarian states that has been down through history
[08:55.920 --> 08:59.760]  I mean this is nothing new this has been repeated so many times in
[08:59.760 --> 09:03.280]  Caesar Augustus you know it's it's it was so clear
[09:03.280 --> 09:06.720]  right up front but I mean you could ask anybody in the Tea Party who's been
[09:06.720 --> 09:11.840]  denied access to 501c3 you can use it look look at the IRS use
[09:11.840 --> 09:17.040]  of the data look at the law enforcement DEA with
[09:17.040 --> 09:20.160]  a parallel construction a parallel construction I mean
[09:20.160 --> 09:23.440]  that's that's spread around the world to other police organizations around the
[09:23.440 --> 09:26.000]  world to anybody with an organization or police
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.480]  organization that has a relationship with the FBI or the DEA around the world
[09:30.480 --> 09:33.440]  is subject to getting this kind of information but they'll never be given
[09:33.440 --> 09:37.440]  the original data from the NSA collection because it's not admissible in a
[09:37.440 --> 09:40.480]  court of law because it wasn't acquired by a warrant
[09:40.480 --> 09:43.440]  and they don't want to with foreigners compromise the fact that they have the
[09:43.440 --> 09:46.560]  ability to collect them and don't they then fence it and wash it and they've
[09:46.560 --> 09:50.400]  been caught adding disinformation and it's a perfect way to put into the
[09:50.400 --> 09:54.960]  global data stream frameups they they did that kind of framing
[09:54.960 --> 09:57.440]  with us they they did that even with us the
[09:57.440 --> 10:00.800]  Department of Justice did that they framed us they tempted to
[10:00.800 --> 10:04.000]  but speak a little bit about that I think that gives people a window
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.120]  into how totalitarian this is well for example in the case in the only case
[10:09.120 --> 10:12.960]  that went to court was Tom Drake's case and that's they took him to court
[10:12.960 --> 10:15.440]  because he was still working for NSA at the time
[10:15.440 --> 10:20.320]  this was in 2007 when they raided us initially and then they raided Tom Drake
[10:20.320 --> 10:23.760]  about three months later but he did his case didn't get the
[10:23.760 --> 10:29.360]  court till about 2010 well 2010 they charged him in 2011
[10:29.360 --> 10:33.280]  in that frame they they wanted to take him to court
[10:33.280 --> 10:37.360]  and then what they did was they took the information that he had at his house
[10:37.360 --> 10:42.480]  that was marked unclassified and they changed that they drew a
[10:42.480 --> 10:46.160]  line through that and then stamped it classified secret or top secret
[10:46.160 --> 10:50.000]  then charged him with having classified material that's like
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.120]  retroactively classifying something so you can charge somebody with having
[10:53.120 --> 10:57.440]  classified material that's framing him okay it's it's a forgery it's a fraud
[10:57.440 --> 11:01.680]  it's a major felony right and and the problem with it is that they didn't
[11:01.680 --> 11:04.000]  know what they had done they'd released most of that material
[11:04.000 --> 11:07.840]  themselves NSA did into the public domain unclassified
[11:07.840 --> 11:11.040]  and that's what Jim Bamford found just drake wasn't stupid he didn't want to
[11:11.040 --> 11:13.120]  go to prison he was only bringing out was already out there
[11:13.120 --> 11:17.600]  yeah well at first of all it was it was unclassified by NSA regulations that was
[11:17.600 --> 11:21.280]  the way they stamped it so I had the former director of Star Wars on
[11:21.280 --> 11:24.320]  he died a few years ago Dr. Bob Bowman and he talked about some of the
[11:24.320 --> 11:27.360]  space planes once and then they called him and came to his house and you kind of
[11:27.360 --> 11:31.920]  threatened him and he said hey here's where it was released on C-span
[11:31.920 --> 11:35.520]  and here's where you guys in your own propaganda a decade ago released it
[11:35.520 --> 11:39.040]  and and then they couldn't go after him but that's the type of stuff they pull
[11:39.040 --> 11:42.720]  right it's total it's a total fabrication of evidence to put people in
[11:42.720 --> 11:45.920]  jail that's our department of justice doing it
[11:45.920 --> 11:50.080]  the bible calls it bearing false witness yes I call it perjury and
[11:50.080 --> 11:54.320]  and felony and these people should be charged and and and and
[11:54.320 --> 11:57.520]  given a chance to explain what they did why tell folks what happened to you
[11:57.520 --> 12:03.200]  before we get into the NSA itself well for me in my case I mean I was kind of
[12:03.200 --> 12:06.320]  prominent you know complaining to senators and
[12:06.320 --> 12:10.080]  representatives and various other people as was time as was Tom Drake let's be
[12:10.080 --> 12:13.120]  clear you guys were doing this internally we were internal in terms of the
[12:13.120 --> 12:16.240]  government yes we were going to the inspector we even
[12:16.240 --> 12:19.920]  Kirk Wiebe and I even went to talk to the department of justice inspector
[12:19.920 --> 12:24.320]  general and of course they couldn't say anything to us but we
[12:24.320 --> 12:28.320]  made it clear what the problem was with this domestic spying
[12:28.320 --> 12:32.640]  but for me and and all four of us who we were the four
[12:32.640 --> 12:37.200]  who were first rated in July of 2007 we were rated because we were the ones who
[12:37.200 --> 12:41.360]  signed the DODIG complaint against NSA charging them with
[12:41.360 --> 12:46.080]  corruption fraud waste and abuse and that caused a DOD major DOD
[12:46.080 --> 12:49.280]  investigation of NSA that all verified what we were saying and that was
[12:49.280 --> 12:52.080]  published but redacted because it was on
[12:52.080 --> 12:56.080]  even even the unclassified embarrassing parts were redacted
[12:56.080 --> 12:59.520]  which is a violation of the NSA regular the government records
[12:59.520 --> 13:03.680]  yeah well it's a violation of government classification regulations too
[13:03.680 --> 13:08.640]  in other words executive order 13526 section 1.7 says you can't classify
[13:08.640 --> 13:12.480]  something or keep it classified or not declassified if it's evidence of a
[13:12.480 --> 13:16.480]  crime or evidence of that embarrasses an agency or
[13:16.480 --> 13:20.160]  you can't use the national security act to cover up criminal activity exactly
[13:20.160 --> 13:25.280]  exactly and that's basically what the what the NSA and the DOJ
[13:25.280 --> 13:29.920]  and the DOD with the with that investigative report
[13:29.920 --> 13:32.960]  that's what they were doing they were redacting and hiding it from congress
[13:32.960 --> 13:36.640]  and hiding it from everybody else so so they're covering up what they're doing
[13:36.640 --> 13:41.360]  and for for us they they attempted after the raid
[13:41.360 --> 13:44.880]  by the way the DODIG's office was the one that gave our names about
[13:44.880 --> 13:48.880]  as the ones who submitted that complaint against NSA they gave our names to the
[13:48.880 --> 13:51.920]  FBI wow and so and that was against their
[13:51.920 --> 13:55.520]  regulations okay i mean who now they're all breaking the law while
[13:55.520 --> 13:58.160]  accusing you of doing it yes and all you're doing is going to congressional
[13:58.160 --> 14:02.320]  committees and inspector generals whose job it is to have oversight and telling
[14:02.320 --> 14:06.480]  them how they're breaking the law yes and also it's the committees who are
[14:06.480 --> 14:09.680]  supposed to uh the intelligence committees in the
[14:09.680 --> 14:13.120]  house and senate and also the FISA court were established after the church
[14:13.120 --> 14:18.640]  committee investigation of NSA CIA and FBI in the in the 70s
[14:18.640 --> 14:22.160]  and one of the main persons they were spying on back in the minaret program
[14:22.160 --> 14:26.960]  was senator church that's right and that was that was only came out recently
[14:26.960 --> 14:29.360]  and the reason they didn't of course was because
[14:29.360 --> 14:33.440]  they are spying on people who have power over them and let's be clear because
[14:33.440 --> 14:37.280]  the fake conservative argument and the fake liberal argument is the same
[14:37.280 --> 14:40.640]  we're protecting you from al-qaeda and drug dealers and all this other stuff
[14:40.640 --> 14:43.360]  but then as more of this gets leaked and comes out
[14:43.360 --> 14:46.080]  they're spying on parliament they're spying on congress they're spying on
[14:46.080 --> 14:48.880]  other agencies and there's so much spying going on
[14:48.880 --> 14:51.840]  you've explained this that back when you were really spying on the russians
[14:51.840 --> 14:56.720]  really spying on radical islamists uh legally and lawfully
[14:56.720 --> 15:00.240]  that was already legal and lawful it's the domestic stuff that's illegal but
[15:00.240 --> 15:04.240]  they they confuse people and say let us protect you from al-qaeda
[15:04.240 --> 15:08.400]  when actually they're doing the opposite they're letting all these groups operate
[15:08.400 --> 15:12.880]  because they're too busy spying on their boyfriends and their girlfriends in the congressman
[15:12.880 --> 15:17.280]  yeah that's and that's one that that's one of the cases came out was the what
[15:17.280 --> 15:21.040]  what they called an nsa love ent love intelligence that's where the
[15:21.040 --> 15:24.400]  the analysts were looking into the data to see whether or not they're
[15:24.400 --> 15:28.640]  their better parts or their uh uh spouses or
[15:28.640 --> 15:32.080]  girlfriends were cheating on them well you don't do that first of all you don't
[15:32.080 --> 15:36.720]  do that america you do not do that with metadata you do that with content
[15:36.720 --> 15:39.360]  and that's what they've been trying to hide that they've been collecting

[20:28.400 --> 20:31.600]  let's get right back to this important interview with william benney
[20:31.600 --> 20:34.800]  formerly of the national security agency
[20:34.800 --> 20:39.040]  william benney the former director of the technical division of the nsa
[20:39.040 --> 20:41.760]  i've seen the news say you were the number two number three number four
[20:41.760 --> 20:46.160]  what position were you in the nsa what that position what level is that
[20:46.160 --> 20:50.480]  well i was a senior executive grade if you
[20:50.480 --> 20:54.320]  get in the military ranks that'd be like a 1.5 star general
[20:54.320 --> 20:59.600]  so but i was i was the technical director of the world geopolitical military
[20:59.600 --> 21:03.840]  analysis and reporting shop that was about 6 000 analysts and reporters
[21:03.840 --> 21:07.120]  the that how high is your IQ because they say you've got like a mathematical
[21:07.120 --> 21:10.800]  brain oh come on be serious about 180 uh no no i
[21:10.800 --> 21:14.400]  think it was 143 or something like that but you know i'm just a basic country
[21:14.400 --> 21:17.920]  but fundamentally but you've got a genius for numbers and code cracking
[21:17.920 --> 21:24.000]  uh i had a really bent for that doing that yes it was uh it it's just a
[21:24.000 --> 21:28.240]  a talent that you have to be able to look at patterns and see patterns in data
[21:28.240 --> 21:31.280]  and when you can do that that's the kind of a thing you need to be able to break
[21:31.280 --> 21:34.560]  things and solve problems sometimes i want to have you on
[21:34.560 --> 21:37.920]  just about you because i mean i know most of it's classified but i mean you
[21:37.920 --> 21:41.120]  battled the russians the chinese everybody right
[21:41.120 --> 21:45.200]  well most of the warsaw pack europe european communist countries and the
[21:45.200 --> 21:48.880]  soviet and you said before it upset you to go from really going spying after
[21:48.880 --> 21:51.840]  serious folks to like spying on congressman
[21:51.840 --> 21:55.440]  yes yeah i mean and every u.s citizen in the country yeah
[21:55.440 --> 21:59.440]  no one was exempt i mean there everybody was taken in
[21:59.440 --> 22:03.920]  i mean even senator rockefeller when he was addressed in january on
[22:03.920 --> 22:07.840]  uh uh cnn i think it was he addressed it he said
[22:07.840 --> 22:12.480]  they've got data on uh they've probably even got data on me
[22:12.480 --> 22:15.680]  well i mean what he's saying is was right i mean they're collecting all the
[22:15.680 --> 22:19.920]  data content and metadata on everybody in the explain those lies for folks they
[22:19.920 --> 22:23.200]  claim oh it's just metadata just you know basically when you called when you
[22:23.200 --> 22:26.320]  didn't call it a phone bill no no no no explain what they're really doing
[22:26.320 --> 22:29.840]  well uh mark kline kind of exposed that too and it's in court record in mark
[22:29.840 --> 22:32.640]  kline's case where he laid out the wiring for all the
[22:32.640 --> 22:37.520]  for the nsa room in the at&t facility in san francisco sure
[22:37.520 --> 22:42.960]  and on that let's think it was room 641 b uh what they did was they put the
[22:42.960 --> 22:47.040]  prism type of fare or a splitter what's called a splitter or y connector
[22:47.040 --> 22:50.640]  where you have a fiber coming in and it sends it duplicates and sends it down
[22:50.640 --> 22:54.560]  to pass one path went to the nsa room and the other path went
[22:54.560 --> 22:58.880]  to an abnormal distribution of communications uh in the nsa room
[22:58.880 --> 23:02.080]  all the diagramming showed all the nearest devices they had in there where
[23:02.080 --> 23:05.440]  they put push the fiber optic networks into the nearest device
[23:05.440 --> 23:09.440]  what that did was re recompile everything on the line and sessionize it
[23:09.440 --> 23:13.120]  meaning reassemble reassemble all the data like if
[23:13.120 --> 23:16.080]  you send an email it goes out in packets will pull all those packets back
[23:16.080 --> 23:19.280]  together and say here's the email you just sent and then they would pass that
[23:19.280 --> 23:22.880]  on to nsa for storage and that's what it that's what
[23:22.880 --> 23:26.160]  that device did it did content collection not just
[23:26.160 --> 23:29.680]  metadata but the content and then now we know those hubs are everywhere
[23:29.680 --> 23:34.160]  and in front of us they're building giant huge complexes to store it all
[23:34.160 --> 23:37.360]  yes the latest one that they they've just submitted an
[23:37.360 --> 23:42.400]  environmental impact statement for is a 2.8 million square foot facility on
[23:42.400 --> 23:46.560]  fort mead at taking up basically the golf course at fort mead
[23:46.560 --> 23:50.080]  that 2.8 million is about three times the size of
[23:50.080 --> 23:55.040]  buffdale just about three times that's a million square feet this is 2.8
[23:55.040 --> 23:58.160]  but a lot about the nsa we've had reporters of san antonio and in
[23:58.160 --> 24:02.080]  utah and you just get there at the walmart parking
[24:02.080 --> 24:05.600]  line start videotaping they run up the police go how dare you videotape us
[24:05.600 --> 24:08.800]  it's just a public you know i mean it's publicly known it's there
[24:08.800 --> 24:12.720]  meanwhile they're stealing all of our data but oh you can't aim a camera at us
[24:12.720 --> 24:16.640]  yeah right it's it's kind of it's they're hypocritical about this i mean
[24:16.640 --> 24:20.000]  it's all they're all hypocrites i mean they're violating the constitution they
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.520]  say they're not everything that's legal well that's retroactively passing laws
[24:23.520 --> 24:27.040]  the problem with that is the laws that they pass have to
[24:27.040 --> 24:30.480]  have to abide to the constitution and when you violate the fourth amendment
[24:30.480 --> 24:34.320]  doesn't matter what kind of law you pass that says sure k to do that it's a
[24:34.320 --> 24:37.680]  violation of the fourth amendment the church and it's not constitutional and
[24:37.680 --> 24:40.880]  you know they said all the constitutions dead you ignore it it won't be a
[24:40.880 --> 24:43.600]  problem but now we see the president saying i'm gonna open the borders without
[24:43.600 --> 24:46.320]  even an order not even congress not even an order from obama
[24:46.320 --> 24:50.560]  i'm going to come out your guns without an order uh or without a law
[24:50.560 --> 24:54.720]  they don't even do the fake orders now they just do it obama announced yesterday
[24:54.720 --> 24:58.400]  no more four years for the white house we're just not gonna follow the law
[24:58.400 --> 25:06.160]  i mean this is dictatorship not of obama himself but of the system in my view
[25:06.160 --> 25:11.760]  how would you describe this slide it's a slide into totalitarianism and an
[25:11.760 --> 25:15.760]  imperial presidency and control of population
[25:15.760 --> 25:19.440]  process i mean that's what they're doing i mean they they kept everybody in the
[25:19.440 --> 25:22.960]  dark so he had no informed electorate to make a decision
[25:22.960 --> 25:26.000]  about who to vote for about these issues or even embracing these issues
[25:26.000 --> 25:31.040]  they're all avoiding this issue and they have an uninformed congress because
[25:31.040 --> 25:35.200]  that's why represented as a martian khania's got a group together of
[25:35.200 --> 25:38.800]  coalition of republicans and democrats to try to unfund nsa because they
[25:38.800 --> 25:42.160]  realized that they were being lied to by the agencies by the and by the
[25:42.160 --> 25:46.400]  intelligence committees and by the administration about what was going on
[25:46.400 --> 25:50.480]  so i mean they had an uninformed congress and an uninformed electorate
[25:50.480 --> 25:56.000]  by design and that's basically what satoviet union the germans that's
[25:56.000 --> 25:59.440]  basically what they did i got a lot of questions coming up for you
[25:59.440 --> 26:01.920]  william benning i want you to be able to speak on other topics you want to get
[26:01.920 --> 26:03.680]  into and go through some slides you gave us
[26:03.680 --> 26:06.800]  the snowden leaks you can break this down for people
[26:06.800 --> 26:10.960]  to kind of give us a roadmap of what's going on but my big question is
[26:10.960 --> 26:15.040]  as best you know not being there in 15 years but what's leaked and what people
[26:15.040 --> 26:20.160]  said how many people really have access to the big master files
[26:20.160 --> 26:25.360]  to go in and send in and a order in and then get all my emails from a year ago
[26:25.360 --> 26:31.280]  or go and see a file a text file of a phone call i had last night
[26:31.280 --> 26:35.200]  how many people have access to this because if snowden could really get
[26:35.200 --> 26:39.040]  access to all of this that means governments spies could as well
[26:39.040 --> 26:41.840]  so even if we had good people in government which we know at the top we
[26:41.840 --> 26:45.600]  don't they built this this fraud they've built
[26:45.600 --> 26:49.840]  something that could be taken over or hacked and thus compromise everything
[26:49.840 --> 26:53.920]  you build something that spies on everything you just built something
[26:53.920 --> 26:57.360]  that corporations spies private corporate criminals
[26:57.360 --> 27:01.200]  anybody can get into an exploit and sell and with government's history
[27:01.200 --> 27:05.600]  of selling driver's license selling uranium whatever the case is
[27:05.600 --> 27:11.040]  this looks like it's a giant bizarre of information that they've just opened up
[27:11.040 --> 27:15.680]  yes and and internally in nsa they have no monitoring of the network as to what
[27:15.680 --> 27:19.280]  what's going on and who's using it my estimate in terms of i mean some of
[27:19.280 --> 27:21.840]  the numbers i've seen say that let's stop there i don't mean to interrupt you
[27:21.840 --> 27:25.520]  we monitor our network to see what people are doing around here we monitor to see
[27:25.520 --> 27:28.480]  if they're downloading stuff it's illegal we have to liability the nsa
[27:28.480 --> 27:33.200]  doesn't monitor their own network that's right in fact we had proposed in the
[27:33.200 --> 27:36.160]  sark the sigin automation research center we proposed a program
[27:36.160 --> 27:40.080]  we called well grounded that said we wanted to monitor the entire worldwide
[27:40.080 --> 27:43.760]  network of nsa who was on it when they were on it what they were doing when
[27:43.760 --> 27:47.680]  they were there as they did it and it would be a matter of monitoring the
[27:47.680 --> 27:51.600]  network log like you probably do here the same principle it's the idea where
[27:51.600 --> 27:54.960]  anybody on the network sends data down the line you can see what they're doing
[27:54.960 --> 27:58.400]  and it's recorded in the log so you can analyze that log with software and
[27:58.400 --> 28:00.880]  that's what we we intended and proposed to do
[28:00.880 --> 28:04.320]  we had two groups opposing that one were all the analysts saying you will be
[28:04.320 --> 28:07.440]  able to see everything i'm doing i don't want you monitoring
[28:07.440 --> 28:10.480]  okay but they're working in a secret government operation they're the ones
[28:10.480 --> 28:13.840]  that should have a record exactly plus plus that people could just
[28:13.840 --> 28:18.560]  sell their code and let anybody in yeah oh my i mean if i was a spy running
[28:18.560 --> 28:22.720]  america i would want there to be no monitoring yeah well that's exactly the
[28:22.720 --> 28:25.840]  part that that's exactly what the analysts said but the real
[28:25.840 --> 28:29.760]  opposers of it were the managers and the reason they didn't want that happening
[28:29.760 --> 28:32.480]  was be we could watch the movement of all the money
[28:32.480 --> 28:36.000]  we could see all the money being spent on every program the return on investment
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.640]  of every program whether or not they were successful or not
[28:38.640 --> 28:42.160]  who who who what companies were competing for to all of that so they
[28:42.160 --> 28:45.840]  didn't want any oversight so basically it's a giant looting operation
[28:45.840 --> 28:50.000]  exactly in fact there's no there is no oversight there's no auditing of nsa by
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.440]  congress uh congress does not audit in a safe
[28:53.440 --> 28:56.880]  this is a setup for corruption

[33:02.640 --> 33:07.360]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:11.440 --> 33:16.320]  you can complain about big brother and how this is uh
[33:16.320 --> 33:19.360]  a potential uh
[33:19.360 --> 33:26.880]  program run amuck but when you actually look at the details
[33:26.880 --> 33:30.640]  then i think we've struck the right balance and if people can't trust
[33:30.640 --> 33:34.640]  not only the executive branch but also don't trust congress
[33:34.640 --> 33:40.160]  and don't trust uh federal judges to make sure that we're abiding by the
[33:40.160 --> 33:45.360]  constitution due process and rule of law then we're gonna have some problems
[33:45.360 --> 33:49.440]  the alex jones show because there is a war on
[33:49.440 --> 33:52.480]  for your mind
[33:53.840 --> 33:57.120]  all the evil men in charge seem to flourish is that good men and women do
[33:57.120 --> 34:00.240]  nothing i think was edmund burks said that
[34:00.240 --> 34:04.080]  british statesman there are good people in the government the
[34:04.080 --> 34:07.760]  government's not our enemy it the big corporations are doing as much
[34:07.760 --> 34:11.440]  spying as the nsa in certain areas it is the fact that we have let
[34:11.440 --> 34:15.280]  government corporations get out of control now there's no oversight
[34:15.280 --> 34:18.880]  they're doing whatever they want it's crazy william benny former technical
[34:18.880 --> 34:20.960]  director of the national security agency
[34:20.960 --> 34:24.320]  one of the most high-level whistleblowers of all time
[34:24.320 --> 34:27.360]  um i mean he has exposed benedict arnold level
[34:27.360 --> 34:30.240]  primes they tried to put him in prison and failed
[34:30.240 --> 34:33.440]  they have successfully put other patriots in prison they put journalists
[34:33.440 --> 34:37.440]  in prison uh but for people in the government
[34:37.440 --> 34:40.880]  better choose a side because this is classic totalitarianism
[34:40.880 --> 34:43.600]  every top constitutional lawyer whether they're liberal or conservative has
[34:43.600 --> 34:47.200]  come out and said we're going over the edge this is scary
[34:47.200 --> 34:51.200]  even congress is saying that but it's there's no oversight so it's just all
[34:51.200 --> 34:54.400]  out of control now now there are centralized groups that have a lot of
[34:54.400 --> 34:58.000]  power but the scariest thing is if this was a centralized
[34:58.000 --> 35:00.880]  system we could probably fix it a lot better
[35:00.880 --> 35:04.320]  am i right from your expert opinion that it's worse
[35:04.320 --> 35:07.920]  that there's not even oversight because there's all these many empires
[35:07.920 --> 35:12.240]  and god knows what's going on with just unlimited spying happening
[35:12.240 --> 35:16.000]  uh and and congress doesn't know what to do i i mean this
[35:16.000 --> 35:20.160]  this is just crazy sounding is that worse than just having one centralized
[35:20.160 --> 35:24.080]  group running it because we could remove them i mean how do you ever get rid of
[35:24.080 --> 35:27.680]  something that's metastasized like this well that's one of the things that we
[35:27.680 --> 35:31.120]  put into into suggestions to the president's in
[35:31.120 --> 35:36.000]  january last year we sent in 21 recommendations on how to fix nsa one
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.200]  of them was to have our our group of technical people be able to monitor
[35:39.200 --> 35:43.680]  everything and we had another one to have focused collection of data
[35:43.680 --> 35:48.080]  that's only that that's only that that kind of data is what's pulled into the
[35:48.080 --> 35:52.000]  nsa not this bulk acquisition that'll that removes the possibility of them
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.360]  even querying that data because now they can't even access because it doesn't
[35:55.360 --> 35:58.640]  exist so if you did a focused attack like we did with
[35:58.640 --> 36:02.720]  our program thin thread back in the 90s that would that would have eliminated
[36:02.720 --> 36:06.000]  this bulk acquisition it couldn't do what they're doing no one could do love in
[36:06.000 --> 36:09.680]  it nsa the fbi and cia can't get into this data to do
[36:09.680 --> 36:13.520]  whatever they want to like they can now because it wouldn't be there
[36:13.520 --> 36:16.320]  they can't alter the data because they can't get to it
[36:16.320 --> 36:21.840]  they they can now yes but but because because under the thin thread program
[36:21.840 --> 36:24.160]  it wouldn't the data wouldn't even be stored there
[36:24.160 --> 36:27.840]  they wouldn't have it so they wouldn't be able to do anything with it
[36:27.840 --> 36:30.880]  that was the point we we had a way of filtering out all
[36:30.880 --> 36:35.280]  all domestic communications metadata content everything if it was domestic
[36:35.280 --> 36:39.200]  it didn't it just passed right by we could recognize it was domestic and not
[36:39.200 --> 36:42.400]  even take it in so we never even acquired it
[36:42.400 --> 36:46.240]  so it couldn't be stored in any nsa database it couldn't be accessed by any
[36:46.240 --> 36:50.080]  nsa analyst or anybody in the so when you were there the nsa was
[36:50.080 --> 36:54.000]  truly spying on foreign adversaries yes but that
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.760]  but at general Hayden when he was director and it was
[36:57.760 --> 37:02.080]  Bush Cheney Hayden and tenant that decided to spy on everybody
[37:02.080 --> 37:07.120]  that was to expand the authority of an nsa to go into in secret by the way
[37:07.120 --> 37:12.160]  to spy and collect data on every u.s citizen and everybody on the planet
[37:12.160 --> 37:15.600]  and so when they did that that's when i first saw that coming in that was when
[37:15.600 --> 37:18.560]  i had to wash my hands of nsa i couldn't be a part of that
[37:18.560 --> 37:22.000]  i had to leave because that was just a i couldn't participate or even be
[37:22.000 --> 37:25.520]  associated with those crimes what did they say to you when you went
[37:25.520 --> 37:27.760]  into your superior's office i guess that'd be the head
[37:27.760 --> 37:32.560]  head of the nsa and what did you say actually i didn't go to them at all i
[37:32.560 --> 37:36.160]  went directly to the house and senate intelligence committees the reason was
[37:36.160 --> 37:39.520]  i knew very simply put that everybody had been
[37:39.520 --> 37:42.960]  co-opted in the hierarchy of nsa they'd committed the crime yes
[37:42.960 --> 37:46.560]  they had been they they they were all a party to it all the lawyers
[37:46.560 --> 37:50.560]  all of the senior managers and nsa had all followed orders from the white
[37:50.560 --> 37:54.640]  house from cheney and bush to do this and that's what Hayden
[37:54.640 --> 37:57.920]  directed them to say that this is what was this direction was coming from the
[37:57.920 --> 38:00.960]  white house therefore we're going to do it it's lawful and we do it to talk about
[38:00.960 --> 38:04.000]  what a hero and how much courage you've got i mean you know how serious people
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.880]  are in this government what they do worldwide how corrupted gotten at that
[38:06.880 --> 38:10.640]  point you had the will to march into congress and to tell
[38:10.640 --> 38:14.640]  them what was going on the first guy i mean that's 10 times bigger than snowed
[38:14.640 --> 38:18.640]  internally and to really start this whole internal debate and this avalanche
[38:18.640 --> 38:21.920]  of understanding now i mean you were really one of the first people to ring
[38:21.920 --> 38:25.280]  the bell to warn folks that that the country
[38:25.280 --> 38:29.120]  as we knew it was being dismantled yes and in order to do that i had to meet
[38:29.120 --> 38:31.840]  with one of the staffers of the house intelligence committee diane roark
[38:31.840 --> 38:35.520]  that i knew so i met with her at her house because we couldn't
[38:35.520 --> 38:39.040]  trust the house intelligence committee because they were a part of it
[38:39.040 --> 38:42.560]  and we also couldn't trust anybody in nsa so the only place that we'd find
[38:42.560 --> 38:46.560]  we could be uh have a conversation or even uh talk about this
[38:46.560 --> 38:49.600]  was her house there was no other place that was secure
[38:49.600 --> 38:52.960]  in the supposed free country of america and then you get swat team tell folks
[38:52.960 --> 38:55.600]  about that well yeah after after that and after
[38:55.600 --> 38:59.920]  talking to other members of congress why uh and it was actually the morning of
[38:59.920 --> 39:03.920]  the second day after attorney general gonzalez's testimony to the senate
[39:03.920 --> 39:07.520]  judiciary committee on the terrorist surveillance program where he only
[39:07.520 --> 39:11.200]  talked about the warrantless wiretap program that was the part that was exposed
[39:11.200 --> 39:14.560]  and claimed it was for al qaeda yeah right that's right but that was only a
[39:14.560 --> 39:17.280]  smidgen of what they were doing i mean that was like an infinite
[39:17.280 --> 39:22.800]  test of what they were really taking in at that time it it must have been a
[39:22.800 --> 39:26.400]  lower percentage of phone calls but a vast majority of emails inside the
[39:26.400 --> 39:30.240]  united states as well as worldwide which i estimated to be
[39:30.240 --> 39:33.760]  now at least 80 percent of the phone's calls in the united states are now being
[39:33.760 --> 39:37.360]  recorded somewhere that's how tim clementi could say that
[39:37.360 --> 39:40.720]  after the boston bombing we can get back to what was said in a phone call be one
[39:40.720 --> 39:43.840]  of the between one of the sarnai brothers and his wife before the bombing
[39:43.840 --> 39:46.800]  let's be clear they're saying it on television that they're recording all
[39:46.800 --> 39:49.680]  the calls but then denying it out of the next breath
[39:49.680 --> 39:54.480]  that was cnn also dr mueller of the fbi in his senate
[39:54.480 --> 39:58.240]  judiciary testimony in 30th of march of 2011
[39:58.240 --> 40:01.280]  said that he got together with the department of defense and set up a
[40:01.280 --> 40:04.640]  database where he and the fbi could make one query
[40:04.640 --> 40:07.520]  and get all pass and all future emails on a person
[40:07.520 --> 40:10.880]  now that tells you that that's coming out of bluffdale by the way
[40:10.880 --> 40:14.000]  all the all the data is being collected and stored
[40:14.000 --> 40:18.080]  and so it's not just it's not just phone calls it's emails it's everything else
[40:18.080 --> 40:22.160]  and and of course some of the recent publications show um credit card use is
[40:22.160 --> 40:25.920]  being stored also how many people in the nsh do you
[40:25.920 --> 40:29.440]  how many people have a high enough clearance in government agencies period
[40:29.440 --> 40:34.640]  be able to go in and hear my phone calls say to my dad yesterday
[40:34.640 --> 40:38.080]  i believe the uh the figures i've seen at least though it's been published is
[40:38.080 --> 40:40.480]  probably on the order of about three thousand
[40:40.480 --> 40:44.640]  uh government employees now that doesn't count contractors who are managing the
[40:44.640 --> 40:48.240]  data that's the real rub you have all these contractors who
[40:48.240 --> 40:50.880]  manage the communications the computers the data
[40:50.880 --> 40:54.640]  stories the query programs and the communications back and forth between
[40:54.640 --> 40:57.440]  the analysts ensure all who could do a snowden level breach of that one
[40:57.440 --> 41:01.440]  level breach yes yeah because they don't have any monitoring system of them
[41:01.440 --> 41:06.240]  anybody with a system administrator or a super user case which is what he and
[41:06.240 --> 41:09.520]  people say there's no way snowden could do it no it's it's like it's designed to
[41:09.520 --> 41:12.160]  bring the country down it's like it's designed to end our national
[41:12.160 --> 41:15.120]  security and then they're selling it as national security
[41:15.120 --> 41:18.880]  well that gets back to that program we wanted to put in place in 1991 or 92
[41:18.880 --> 41:22.560]  which was well grounded to monitor this and we were opposed by the analysts and
[41:22.560 --> 41:26.240]  the administrator the managers because of all the all the material would
[41:26.240 --> 41:30.080]  expose that they were doing but that meant that they left the
[41:30.080 --> 41:32.960]  entire network with no monitoring system at all
[41:32.960 --> 41:36.080]  that's why they can't tell what snowden took that's they don't have any idea
[41:36.080 --> 41:39.680]  they're guessing 1.7 million what's behind an open border
[41:39.680 --> 41:44.320]  what's behind an open nsa what's behind at the end of the day what do you think
[41:44.320 --> 41:47.520]  the different power elites are thinking
[41:47.520 --> 41:50.960]  i i basically see us moving to a controlled
[41:50.960 --> 41:56.000]  society a totalitarian state where where it is
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.080]  the government wants to be in charge i mean when reagan said we're a country
[42:00.080 --> 42:03.120]  with a government i think we're now a government with a country
[42:03.120 --> 42:06.560]  and that's and all of the things that are happening are only tightening
[42:06.560 --> 42:10.400]  that control on the people they're going to manipulate them and
[42:10.400 --> 42:14.080]  and keep as long as they can keep them uninformed
[42:14.080 --> 42:17.680]  and nobody realizes what's going on or they don't see the threat if they say
[42:17.680 --> 42:21.120]  um you have nothing if you've done nothing wrong you have nothing to hide
[42:21.120 --> 42:24.240]  first of all that's a great quote from joseph gerbils
[42:24.240 --> 42:28.160]  and secondly that's totally irrelevant yeah they're actually quoting joseph
[42:28.160 --> 42:31.680]  gerbils on a routine basis yeah it's like it's like satire
[42:31.680 --> 42:34.800]  it's like the lies they keep saying that's right out of hitler's playbook
[42:34.800 --> 42:38.320]  if you're gonna tell a lie make it a big one and tell it frequently till it's
[42:38.320 --> 42:42.560]  believed and that's what's going on here and we're assuming that we trust our
[42:42.560 --> 42:44.720]  government so we're assuming they're telling us the truth
[42:44.720 --> 42:47.360]  all that's just wrong it's just a bunch of corporations and private
[42:47.360 --> 42:52.240]  contractors screwing us up for money yes i i've been basically

[47:20.240 --> 47:25.040]  and play part of an interview that david knight and paul joseph watson of
[47:25.040 --> 47:29.680]  info wars dot com did recently with a true american political
[47:29.680 --> 47:33.360]  prisoner barrett brown an interview from jail
[47:33.360 --> 47:36.480]  he's in prison for exercising his free speech
[47:36.480 --> 47:39.520]  you know this country's in danger when stuff like this is happening
[47:39.520 --> 47:42.160]  let's go to the senate let's go to barrett brown barrett i wanted to give
[47:42.160 --> 47:46.080]  you a chance to talk to the public we talked about your
[47:46.080 --> 47:49.840]  comments to the judge saying that this isn't about the rule of law anymore we
[47:49.840 --> 47:54.320]  now have the rule of law enforcement tell us what you want to tell us about
[47:54.320 --> 47:58.320]  your trial now that the gag order has been taken off
[47:58.320 --> 48:02.480]  well the first thing i should mention is that uh so aside from what i put forth
[48:02.480 --> 48:05.600]  in the article for the daily beast uh about a month ago and aside from what
[48:05.600 --> 48:08.560]  i'll tell you about today the the great majority of the things that people
[48:08.560 --> 48:12.000]  didn't know about the trial are still sealed and that'll that'll that should
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.600]  continue for about six months uh so in addition to all the all the very
[48:15.600 --> 48:18.880]  egregious things that have happened uh that there's a great deal more
[48:18.880 --> 48:22.320]  that's still not public now uh regarding the trial
[48:22.320 --> 48:25.680]  i guess the basic lesson here is that the federal government
[48:25.680 --> 48:28.320]  can do whatever it wants essentially within the department of justice uh
[48:28.320 --> 48:31.280]  within the federal justice system uh that's that's clear from the extent of
[48:31.280 --> 48:34.800]  the perjury uh very demonstrable perjury that occurred in this case uh
[48:34.800 --> 48:38.480]  again some of which is uh visible some of which can be confirmed publicly
[48:38.480 --> 48:41.360]  through documents some of which is still sealed and that's really what i've
[48:41.360 --> 48:45.200]  tried to convey to the judge in that uh the allegation i gave is that you know
[48:45.200 --> 48:50.000]  when you allow this perjury uh to occur uh we're getting away from the rule of
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.680]  law we're we're getting to a situation in which we're going to the forms we're
[48:53.680 --> 48:56.960]  meeting in a nice very pretty hardwood room with paintings and
[48:56.960 --> 49:00.480]  there's a big nice wood podium and very pretty ropes and all that
[49:00.480 --> 49:03.280]  but you're missing something which is the rule of law and to the extent the rule
[49:03.280 --> 49:06.160]  of law isn't there you're going to see things like anonymous you're going to
[49:06.160 --> 49:09.440]  see things like wiki leaks uh you're going to keep seeing until we get the
[49:09.440 --> 49:12.480]  rule of law one of the things reading the transcript
[49:12.480 --> 49:17.520]  the judge dressed down the prosecutor for not referring to you as mr brown and
[49:17.520 --> 49:20.640]  i as you're just talking about you you got this fancy room with all the
[49:20.640 --> 49:24.240]  trappings and everything but they're grinding the rule of law into the ground
[49:24.240 --> 49:28.960]  and i thought he's worried about being polite to people while he's doing that
[49:28.960 --> 49:32.400]  while he's railrolling this whole process that that's amazing that kind of thing
[49:32.400 --> 49:35.200]  is that kind of thing is very important to establishment characters in dc it's
[49:35.200 --> 49:37.920]  very important to uh the people who who have that
[49:37.920 --> 49:41.280]  federal government mentality you know i would have preferred him to object
[49:41.280 --> 49:46.320]  uh at the last uh hearing when the prosecutor asked the fbi agent how long
[49:46.320 --> 49:49.680]  is barry brownburn an anarchist that would have been the time to object when
[49:49.680 --> 49:52.240]  they start asking about my political ideology
[49:52.240 --> 49:55.760]  incidentally uh this thing about me being an anarchist which is true
[49:55.760 --> 49:59.600]  uh that actually comes up in a couple of other documents including the uh
[49:59.600 --> 50:02.800]  the gag order when when they when they asked for me to be gagged one of me
[50:02.800 --> 50:05.600]  being an anarchist was one of the reasons they cited in one of the documents
[50:05.600 --> 50:09.440]  that still sealed uh regarding my sentencing uh they call for me to
[50:09.440 --> 50:13.360]  give the additional prison time because i'm an anarchist and thus uh more
[50:13.360 --> 50:18.080]  likely apparently to commit crimes so there's a lot of egregious things that
[50:18.080 --> 50:21.440]  on an individual basis really should have been a national story you know on
[50:21.440 --> 50:23.920]  each given thing uh obviously the seizure of the declaration of
[50:23.920 --> 50:27.920]  independence in a more perfect world uh would have been a major news story
[50:27.920 --> 50:31.200]  uh unfortunately the world we're in it didn't quite didn't quite rate national
[50:31.200 --> 50:35.760]  coverage yes that was amazing tell the audience about that
[50:35.760 --> 50:38.880]  well among the uh items that you can see this and this is links to from my my
[50:38.880 --> 50:42.080]  daily beast article uh my post cyberpunk and
[50:42.080 --> 50:45.840]  conservative you can find online uh you know we we have the the list of
[50:45.840 --> 50:48.560]  abidance they see as you know evidence of a crime
[50:48.560 --> 50:52.320]  and you get computers it's my notes there's only one book they took uh i
[50:52.320 --> 50:55.360]  have a lot of books in my apartment at the time and the only book they took
[50:55.360 --> 50:57.920]  was a copy of the Declaration of Independence just this little pocket
[50:57.920 --> 51:01.760]  copy and that's rather explain never have to explain why they took it uh i'm
[51:01.760 --> 51:04.640]  assuming it that has to do something to do with the the FBI
[51:04.640 --> 51:06.960]  member ran it a few years ago when they said you know patriots
[51:06.960 --> 51:09.920]  to um militia types they like the constitution they might have a copy
[51:09.920 --> 51:12.720]  of the constitution thus having a copy of the constitution might be
[51:12.720 --> 51:15.680]  evidence of the crime i'm assuming they just sort of got it mixed up with one of
[51:15.680 --> 51:19.040]  those one of those enlightenment documents you know FBI agents aren't as
[51:19.040 --> 51:22.080]  educated as we might expect them to be or might help them to be anyway so they
[51:22.080 --> 51:24.880]  just grabbed it and then you know never came up with the trial would have been
[51:24.880 --> 51:28.480]  even for them it would have been a little much to actually discuss that uh
[51:28.480 --> 51:31.680]  you know in the course of the trial so one of the things you mentioned at the
[51:31.680 --> 51:34.400]  end of the article was two days before your sentencing in the department of
[51:34.400 --> 51:38.800]  justice withheld from the defense team chat transcripts from Jeremy Hammond
[51:38.800 --> 51:41.840]  tell us about that let's call it from a federal prison
[51:41.840 --> 51:45.280]  that's one of those charming little reminders once well um yes it actually
[51:45.280 --> 51:48.960]  came out two days before an article by i think deal Cameron uh
[51:48.960 --> 51:53.040]  that in fact it is something we had no idea of the department of justice had
[51:53.040 --> 51:57.440]  documents that show quite quite demonstrably that i was not
[51:57.440 --> 52:01.360]  a co-conspirator in the strap rack uh which which was a major
[52:01.360 --> 52:05.200]  uh point you know the DOJ's uh favoring getting me
[52:05.200 --> 52:07.440]  you know actually getting me to show prison time this claim that i was
[52:07.440 --> 52:10.400]  somehow a co-conspirator and they withheld that evidence
[52:10.400 --> 52:14.400]  and the evidence is now public it's it was made public
[52:14.400 --> 52:17.920]  before my sentencing and this is something that again in a more perfect
[52:17.920 --> 52:21.280]  world the judge would care about just as much as he cares about what i'm called
[52:21.280 --> 52:26.720]  mr brown or barrett or do whatever uh but it just didn't quite uh
[52:26.720 --> 52:29.840]  didn't quite come to his attention didn't quite
[52:29.840 --> 52:33.520]  interested very much uh it's actually just goes to show this
[52:33.520 --> 52:36.640]  this particular case obviously it's inconvenient to be in prison but on the
[52:36.640 --> 52:39.760]  other hand we have a great example here uh this whole case
[52:39.760 --> 52:44.080]  the investigation all the way to the sentencing of how this system works
[52:44.080 --> 52:48.160]  particularly if the DOJ wants you you know very much wants you to do prison
[52:48.160 --> 52:51.680]  uh it's just a great example of how they're able to get away with these
[52:51.680 --> 52:55.040]  things even in the public eye and there's the other story here of
[52:55.040 --> 52:58.240]  course is uh how poorly the mainstream media
[52:58.240 --> 53:01.920]  does in keeping up with these things absolutely we spoke on the phone the
[53:01.920 --> 53:04.960]  other day barrett and you were talking about uh i was asking you what you knew
[53:04.960 --> 53:08.000]  about the uh michael hastings uh you know case
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.720]  and uh how the fbi came out and said that they weren't
[53:10.720 --> 53:14.000]  looking into him you said that you believe that you know 99 percent that
[53:14.000 --> 53:17.600]  fbi was definitely looking to him yeah it's even even aside from the other
[53:17.600 --> 53:20.080]  reasons they would have to look into him it's absolutely ludicrous for them to
[53:20.080 --> 53:24.080]  say that because with regards to my group project p.m which runs the echelon
[53:24.080 --> 53:27.360]  two dot org website which was really what this case was all about
[53:27.360 --> 53:31.920]  uh you know they they they subpoenaed the IP address information for everyone
[53:31.920 --> 53:35.920]  who's ever contributed to that to that website of ours and so these are just
[53:35.920 --> 53:39.280]  sort of small players within project p.m now michael hastings on the other hand
[53:39.280 --> 53:42.640]  as i noted in a fair article a number of years ago when he was still alive and
[53:42.640 --> 53:45.840]  when i was writing about him uh you know he was instrumental when i was first
[53:45.840 --> 53:49.920]  creating project p.m and helping me sort of flesh out the philosophy of it uh
[53:49.920 --> 53:53.680]  so the idea that he who was in contact with me regarding project p.m
[53:53.680 --> 53:57.120]  was never investigated uh regarding project p.m is
[53:57.120 --> 54:00.480]  absolutely hundred percent ludicrous and again that's that's in addition to the
[54:00.480 --> 54:03.600]  other reasons they and other certain other organizations would have to be
[54:03.600 --> 54:06.800]  investigating and harassing him he obviously did a great job
[54:06.800 --> 54:10.080]  and he's well he's best known for for forcing the crystal to resign number
[54:10.080 --> 54:13.440]  of years ago but really his article uh exposing the
[54:13.440 --> 54:16.640]  psyops campaign used by i believe a two-star general in afghanistan against
[54:16.640 --> 54:19.920]  visiting senators that's something i cite constantly uh in my
[54:19.920 --> 54:22.880]  articles for the guardian or whatever as evidence of here's what these people are
[54:22.880 --> 54:25.600]  willing to do even to your elected officials
[54:25.600 --> 54:29.920]  obviously one of the charges is the fact that he merely provided a link
[54:29.920 --> 54:35.760]  to the strat for email leaks what kind of precedent does that create for
[54:35.760 --> 54:39.280]  web publishers for activists going forward well it means that the federal
[54:39.280 --> 54:43.680]  government now has a expanded toolkit a vastly expanded toolkit by which to
[54:43.680 --> 54:46.320]  come after anyone that they wanted to come after to begin with
[54:46.320 --> 54:50.240]  whether or not they've actually committed a crime uh by by uh criminalizing
[54:50.240 --> 54:53.280]  the act of linking especially in my case we don't even know what you're linking
[54:53.280 --> 54:57.440]  to uh and and had no interest or use for for the
[54:57.440 --> 54:59.840]  in this turn it turned out to credit card numbers and addition to other
[54:59.840 --> 55:02.480]  information that i ended up linking to which is already public
[55:02.480 --> 55:05.920]  uh that that's that's a terrible precedent by which journalists
[55:05.920 --> 55:09.440]  researchers uh are now at risk and of course there are some journalists and
[55:09.440 --> 55:13.440]  researchers who uh are are a danger to the government
[55:13.440 --> 55:17.520]  and especially the doj and thus you know the doj now has one more option by
[55:17.520 --> 55:20.400]  which to come after them uh quinn norton who writes for wire to
[55:20.400 --> 55:23.920]  testify to my hearing uh she she explained a few days
[55:23.920 --> 55:27.360]  afterwards after this uh decision that she was going to stop doing security
[55:27.360 --> 55:30.640]  reporting has too dangerous she she told this to the judge
[55:30.640 --> 55:33.360]  the judge at my hearing said you know i'm gonna go ahead and hit him with this
[55:33.360 --> 55:36.960]  this additional uh you're in prison for the uh linking i don't think it's going
[55:36.960 --> 55:40.000]  to be a concern to journalists which is bizarre because of course journalists
[55:40.000 --> 55:43.600]  have been expressing concern about this those charges uh ever since they were
[55:43.600 --> 55:47.280]  made two years ago and even after my my uh sentencing there was
[55:47.280 --> 55:50.560]  a number of articles in the u.s. news report uh columbia
[55:50.560 --> 55:53.680]  journalists from review the intercepts again expressing concern about this so
[55:53.680 --> 55:58.240]  the judge is not a brilliant flower of jurisprudence or anything really he
[55:58.240 --> 56:01.200]  just he's just sort of a puppet of the doj which is not a not a bad guy just
[56:01.200 --> 56:05.120]  know what he's doing uh and so again alas that's that situation we're in now
[56:05.120 --> 56:08.400]  now hopefully something will come of this in the case in general hopefully people
[56:08.400 --> 56:13.200]  will make use of what's happened in my case to bring some attention to to the
[56:13.200 --> 56:16.480]  mainstream uh because again this affects journalists and
[56:16.480 --> 56:19.040]  you know when you start coming after journalists then you start you have the
[56:19.040 --> 56:22.640]  option the potential to get journalists attention especially when you're uh
[56:22.640 --> 56:26.560]  quoting someone uh fox news contributor and then they they use that against you
[56:26.560 --> 56:29.200]  that quote yeah and that's that's really i think the most
[56:29.200 --> 56:32.640]  bizarre the number one most bizarre thing in a comedy of bizarre errors uh
[56:32.640 --> 56:36.080]  the fact that a a fox news commentator went on television and talks about how
[56:36.080 --> 56:39.920]  he wanted we should murder jillian asanj i quoted that on my twitter account you
[56:39.920 --> 56:43.600]  know of course jillian asanj is is someone who i respect and he respects me
[56:43.600 --> 56:48.080]  we have sort of an association uh that ended up my indictment as if it was
[56:48.080 --> 56:52.000]  something that i said or you know approved of and uh even after we pointed
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.320]  out you know in in a profiling that you know this
[56:54.320 --> 56:57.360]  arab brown didn't say that this is the some other guy that
[56:57.360 --> 57:01.120]  arab brown obviously wouldn't get along with saying it uh the prosecution stuck
[57:01.120 --> 57:04.160]  with it instead of saying others the mistake you're right they stuck with
[57:04.160 --> 57:07.600]  it and said yes he's promoting this quote which is again really raises the
[57:07.600 --> 57:11.120]  question of if it's a terrible quote that even promoting gets you indicted that
[57:11.120 --> 57:13.760]  how come the guy who started on national television hasn't been indicted
[57:13.760 --> 57:17.040]  and the answer of course is because the guy on fox news is not a danger to the
[57:17.040 --> 57:20.320]  doger is he like commentators are both left and
[57:20.320 --> 57:23.840]  we'll be right back after this quick break in the second hour

[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.880]  daniel estlin on the secrets of the belterbark group then dr wakefield
[01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:36.640]  bruce fine and more there is an extra special and rare total lunar eclipse
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:40.000]  taking place this saturday morning it has some people
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:44.720]  worried for this easter weekend the blood moon is a rare celestial event
[01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:49.280]  yet for the third time in less than a year the moon will dip behind the earth's
[01:00:49.280 --> 01:00:52.720]  shadow appearing a deep coppery red for a few minutes
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.520]  and this will transform the skies over north america asia and australia
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:01:01.840]  into a deep red color now there are several interesting things about this
[01:01:01.840 --> 01:01:06.480]  particular blood moon while some eclipses can last an hour or more
[01:01:06.480 --> 01:01:10.000]  this will be the shortest lunar eclipse of this century
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.360]  it's also taking place the morning of easter vigil
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:16.880]  which is traditionally observed as the period between good friday
[01:01:16.880 --> 01:01:22.400]  and easter sunday the eclipse also falls within the first night of pass over
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:27.040]  which is observed by jews worldwide beginning friday at sunset
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:32.320]  now according to nasa the rare tetrad of four alignments in close proximity
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:35.200]  has only happened a handful of times in the last
[01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.760]  2000 years the final blood moon eclipse of the tetrad series
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:43.520]  will take place september 28th 2015
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:46.960]  which also happens to be a jewish holiday
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:50.720]  many people believe that these lunar eclipses and their appearance on
[01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:54.000]  auspicious dates signals a world-changing event
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.960]  that's about to take place the sun shall be turned into darkness
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.120]  and the moon into blood before the great and terrible day
[01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:09.120]  of the lord comes joel 231 now there's something else
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.160]  about this tetrad series that's pretty bizarre
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.560]  it happens to fall in a schmita year this is something that hasn't happened
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:21.280]  for 2000 years rabbi jonathan kahn points out in his
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:25.280]  book the mystery of the schmita that these years in the past have brought
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:28.880]  down economies kingdoms and nations that haven't
[01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.000]  followed god's will a very major thing happened that
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.760]  escaped most people the schmita began in the autumn of
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:40.240]  2014 and what happened is within two weeks actually within one week of it
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.040]  beginning and remember the schmita can mean the fall
[01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.880]  within one week america was overtaken russia became the
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:50.080]  greatest nuclear power on earth it actually surpassed the first week of the
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:52.480]  schmita the second week of the schmita so it came
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:57.040]  something even more major and that is that the american age that began in the
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:03:00.640]  year 1871 when we became the strongest economic power on
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:05.360]  earth came to an end america was dethroned as the
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.520]  schmita began it is now china has taken the crown of america
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:12.880]  now i've warned for it since the harbinger came out i've warned
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.240]  that if we don't turn back to god there is going to be the crown that america
[01:03:16.240 --> 01:03:19.520]  has worn as the head of nation is going to be removed we are seeing the beginning
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:22.800]  of that right now and so we are watching actually when
[01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:27.040]  when the um the same week that the schmita began wall street went crazy for
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:30.960]  about a month now the pattern of the the last
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:34.720]  schmitas have been that often at the beginning of the schmita you don't notice
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:38.400]  anything but there are often foreshadows well the major thing if
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:41.200]  something's going to happen the major period is going to be
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:43.680]  coming up is that the always at the end of the schmita
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:46.960]  as we approach september that's the time of that wipeout
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:50.320]  i'm not saying it has to happen but i believe we need to be aware of it
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:53.520]  and interesting people who look you know look at signs
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:57.680]  um there one of the signs in the bible of judgment is the darkening of the sun
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:00.800]  or an eclipse not that it always is but it can be
[01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:05.200]  on the day that we get to the wipeout day a little 29 of this schmita
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:08.320]  cycle the sun is going to be darkened at that time
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.120]  that the last time that happened was 1987 when the the sun was darkened at the
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:17.120]  at a little 29 it led into black monday the worst day crash
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:21.120]  in world history um i believe we are going to watch if we don't turn back if
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:24.000]  this nation keeps on going on its course we're going to watch
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  the fall of america or the shaking of america and the american age that you
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.200]  and i and on all our listeners have known since we were born
[01:04:31.200 --> 01:04:35.440]  is going to come to an end you can witness this rare event for yourself
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.600]  the action starts at 5 16 a.m central standard time on the morning of april
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:45.760]  fourth the earth's shadow will slowly move across the moon
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:56.960]  covering it entirely just before 7 a.m

[01:06:55.200 --> 01:07:00.720]  fiction at a lot of levels just like ian fleming's james bond
[01:07:00.720 --> 01:07:04.480]  novels were true stories put into a composite
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:07.840]  and he now has released a documentary we're going to be telling you
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:13.120]  about today so he's got the big scoop on where it may be held this year
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:16.800]  is it accurate as some are saying that it's going to be in austria
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:20.960]  and a lot more daniel thank you for joining us alex it's always a great
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.280]  enormous pleasure for me to be on the show
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:30.160]  you and i go way back uh in 2006 uh we had uh together standing right in front
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:34.400]  of the belterberg hotel in canada on a while uh when you are arrested if you
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.080]  remember of course you remember yes just before you came to canada
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:41.680]  and uh so we've been doing this for a long long time of course uh
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.680]  jim tucker was with us he's no longer with us but uh there's a lot of people
[01:07:45.680 --> 01:07:49.760]  out there who are doing what they can to make sure that this story doesn't die
[01:07:49.760 --> 01:07:53.280]  and again this global awareness which we were talking about before
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.280]  on the world stage people are becoming aware more and more what's going on as
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:01.280]  a result of technological revolution internet everything else out there
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:06.320]  is getting more and more difficult for the global elite to hide their deeds
[01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:09.360]  looking at what's happening why do you think they're coming show out in the
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:12.080]  open and then you've got the floor because i got asked questions but i want
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:15.520]  to know what's on your mind the latest intel you've gotten
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:20.400]  well the belterberg meeting is being held actually in 2015 in in austria on my
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.480]  twitter account at estuary and daniel i published a couple of months ago
[01:08:24.480 --> 01:08:29.600]  a uh an information and report that got from my intel sources in the ministry
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:34.160]  of the interior of austria who sent me the report saying which dates that
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:37.760]  everybody in austria has to be on the lookout there is no holidays that week
[01:08:37.760 --> 01:08:40.880]  i believe it's from the ninth i can't remember exactly the date right now
[01:08:40.880 --> 01:08:44.640]  but it's the beginning of june and it is being held in austria and we have the
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:48.080]  documents to demonstrate it as far as what's going on in the world
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.040]  the global is to leave the reason actually all this information is coming
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:54.800]  out right now electives but the global leader faced with the reality
[01:08:54.800 --> 01:08:59.680]  of seeking to dominate populations that are increasingly becoming self-aware
[01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:04.720]  now developing a global consciousness thus a population being subjected to
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:08.720]  domination in africa for example has the ability to become aware of a
[01:09:08.720 --> 01:09:11.680]  population being subjected to the same forms
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:16.080]  of domination in the middle east in south america or in asia or even in europe
[01:09:16.080 --> 01:09:20.000]  in greece for example and they can recognize that they're all being
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:24.880]  dominated by the same global power structures and that is the key
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:28.640]  point not only is the awakening global in its reach
[01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:33.280]  but also in its nature it creates within the individual and awareness of the
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:36.880]  global condition so it is a global awakening both on the
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:40.880]  external environment and also in the internal psychology
[01:09:40.880 --> 01:09:44.560]  and this is something that the elitists such as the builder burgers
[01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:49.760]  the trilateral commission counseling for relations pinai circle by emion grove
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.520]  and all this you know in omg's rocker fellow
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:56.240]  foundations karnig is every you know hudson's and
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:10:00.000]  and hoover's they simply you know can't deal with it right now
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.760]  because it's a new game and this new reality in the world
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:08.320]  comes with the fact that the world's population has never been so vast
[01:10:08.320 --> 01:10:12.720]  presents a challenge to elitists seeking to dominate people all over the world
[01:10:12.720 --> 01:10:17.280]  who are aware and awaken to the realities of social inequality
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:23.360]  to war poverty exploitation disrespect imperialism and domination and of
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:27.360]  course this directly implies that these populations
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:30.640]  will be significantly more challenging to control
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:34.720]  both economically politically socially psychologically and also
[01:10:34.720 --> 01:10:39.520]  spiritually by the way we're rolling some background footage
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:43.280]  of your new film and i tell you it looks like better than something you see on
[01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:47.440]  hbo the camera work the research i cannot wait to
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:51.120]  see this tell us about your new documentary daniel
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:55.120]  and how soon we can get a copy of it i'd love to sell it on
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:58.480]  dvd or blu-ray once it comes out at my store but
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:02.000]  i hope it goes in theaters first to tell people the name
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:06.080]  tell us all about this incredible documentary on the belterberg group that
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:09.360]  you've produced well we actually we're we're in a
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:12.640]  post-production now the film comes out at the end of may beginning of june
[01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:16.720]  we've been at it for about four years it's our production we've gone
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:20.720]  down interviews in 11 countries canada the united states most of europe
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:23.760]  we've traveled up and down all over the place the first producer of the
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:28.480]  documentary was actually wiped out economically if you believe in conspiracy
[01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:34.160]  okay in coincidence theories one three banks called in loans on the same day
[01:11:34.160 --> 01:11:38.000]  and that's it basically bankrupted him so we actually and by the way i
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:42.400]  i separately know about this not from you but but i know who the group was
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.440]  are we allowed to say who they were or we shouldn't talk about it
[01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:50.880]  you can if you want exactly was that the guys with the house young group
[01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:55.680]  no no no the house and group that's the uh that's the uh the uh the uh major
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:11:59.440]  motion picture yeah that's the folks that made terminator that they also came
[01:11:59.440 --> 01:12:03.360]  after them and took them over to stop your phone getting made right
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:06.560]  yeah well these are other people who are producing the uh the documentary these
[01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:09.920]  are the people in spain independent producers people who so this has happened
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:13.680]  twice then if i'm correct this happened twice once with the
[01:12:13.680 --> 01:12:16.880]  migration motion picture and now with the documentary which is why it took us a
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:20.560]  bit longer but it's almost with the post production stages i tell a little
[01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:24.160]  anecdote i sent a letter an email to uh martin wool
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:27.920]  the Pulitzer prize winning journalist with a financial fault of times
[01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:30.560]  and i asked him for an interview and i got a reply and of course we're going to
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:34.480]  put it in the the documentary he sent an email how dare you
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:38.080]  make a documentary about the build up a group so the documentary is coming out
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:42.320]  of the of june end of may we're in the post production
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:45.680]  and you know we're very very close to the finish line
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:48.720]  we're going to be over that finish line and the film is going to be out
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.520]  worldwide release there's a lot of international
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:55.760]  large film festivals who are very interested and also bill neberg
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:59.520]  has become a household name the book came out 10 years ago and now everybody
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:03.280]  knows about it and i think this is the time it's the right time socially
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:07.120]  speaking without the changes taking place in the world that people think
[01:13:07.120 --> 01:13:11.440]  finally are ready to embrace this concept that you've been talking about
[01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.120]  for about over a decade and you know i've been talking about it for over
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:18.560]  a decade well you've got Nigel Farage in here you've got
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:23.760]  just an amazing list of top people in your film i cannot wait to see this what
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:27.680]  what's the name of the film it's called a true story of the
[01:13:27.680 --> 01:13:31.200]  builder group it's based obviously on my book it's actually the first
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.960]  documentary which is based on a book most documentaries you know are not
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:38.320]  based on books but this one is based on my book the true story of the builder
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:41.040]  group i get is going to be out in theaters
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:45.600]  end of may beginning of june and uh what it's out either to say i'd be more
[01:13:45.600 --> 01:13:49.280]  than more than happy and pleased to go back when you show and talk about it
[01:13:49.280 --> 01:13:53.120]  in closing i know you've got sources i know a lot of it now is pretty much as
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.760]  you said last time you were on is put out at devos but
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:01.120]  what's on the agenda for 2015 in switzerland or in austria one of the
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:05.600]  key issues as a fiscal austerity you know this boogie boogie man term is back
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:09.680]  it's kind of vague term that is you know actually refers to cutting social
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:13.440]  spending and increasing taxes and the effect this has is that the public
[01:14:13.440 --> 01:14:16.800]  sector is devastated as all assets of privatized public
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:20.080]  workers you know a fired and mass unemployment becomes rapid
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:22.960]  health and education disappear taxes rise dramatically
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.960]  and currencies are devalued to make all assets cheaper for international
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:31.360]  corporations banks to buy up while internally causing inflation
[01:14:31.360 --> 01:14:35.040]  dramatically increasing the costs of fuel and food and in short
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:39.600]  fiscal austerity implies social destruction as we're seeing right now in
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:44.400]  greece as we saw in spain as we saw in in portugal and as we're seeing you know
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:48.720]  in in italy and you know the social destruction of the social foundations
[01:14:48.720 --> 01:14:52.480]  of nations and people's are pulled out from under them
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.480]  stage them become despotic and oppressed the people who naturally revolt
[01:14:56.480 --> 01:15:01.520]  against austerity and this is called the sterilization of society and this is
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:04.960]  the term again this is the term alex you're gonna be
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:09.760]  seeing a lot more you know with build up to build a big and then post build a break
[01:15:09.760 --> 01:15:13.920]  we've talked about this before you know terms like the industrialization
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:16.800]  zero growth demand destruction you know they were
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:19.600]  discussed of these private secret meetings and then suddenly they were
[01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:24.160]  front and center major newspapers next big front and center newspaper piece
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:27.760]  is sterilization of society it sounds awful
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:30.880]  just the world's realization itself about the connotations we start
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:34.560]  sterilizing society it takes on a meaning of its own
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:39.040]  it takes it you know to an nth degree you know of evil
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:43.680]  that needless to say we have to make sure we fight this
[01:15:43.680 --> 01:15:46.720]  on the other side of this break we're going to be talking to dr andrew

[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:21.680]  saturday lost my wife and a girlfriend
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:27.760]  somewhere along the way in defense of human liberty alex jones
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.840]  i'll be looking for aid when they pull that game
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:37.040]  and i hope that judging dr wakefield i can ask questions i can rant and rave
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:40.640]  brief the people out there where we are now in this totalitarian push
[01:20:40.640 --> 01:20:44.800]  the force inoculation now it's do or die we're close to breaking their back
[01:20:44.800 --> 01:20:47.520]  that's why we're seeing their battle the bulge moment
[01:20:47.520 --> 01:20:51.280]  when let's just compare them to hitler that we've driven them back we're
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:53.600]  winning and they hit us with everything they've got
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.840]  but you can see that zeb detrick out there leading this attack
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:00.960]  doesn't have the moral high ground he's going to fail i don't care how big and
[01:21:00.960 --> 01:21:04.400]  black his army tanks are the ground troops are out there
[01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:07.680]  with their bazookas we're taking these tanks out right now
[01:21:07.680 --> 01:21:10.720]  let's talk about what's happening you've got the floor and here's the thing
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:14.960]  those those congressional uh that they're in the recess next week
[01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:18.480]  so they are coming back many of them to their district you can go and meet them
[01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.480]  in your district you don't have to travel to dc but you make sure
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:27.520]  that every congressman in this country is aware of exactly what's going on
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:31.280]  because at the moment pharma lobbyists are scaling capital hill
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:34.960]  like orcs storming helms deep it's the hideous site
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:38.560]  and even though you can see they're huge offensive i mean this is this is this
[01:21:38.560 --> 01:21:41.680]  is battle the bulge i mean they're throwing everything they've got
[01:21:41.680 --> 01:21:46.000]  and this is a matter between congress and a congressional agents or a federal
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.280]  agency the cdc it shouldn't involve the pharma lobbyists at all
[01:21:51.280 --> 01:21:55.840]  that the congressman should have the chutzpah to say to them
[01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:59.680]  this is none of your business you may be indirectly affected by the outcome of
[01:21:59.680 --> 01:22:03.200]  this but this is between us and a federal agency
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:06.800]  that has a committed an alleged fraud so get out of my office
[01:22:06.800 --> 01:22:10.560]  and wait for the result well think about with government run health care
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:14.240]  that's run by special interest and written by it they can just make us buy
[01:22:14.240 --> 01:22:17.120]  whatever quote health products they want including
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:21.520]  vaccinated vaccines this is super high-tech slavery i mean this is over
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:25.360]  the top yeah so please go to autism media channel
[01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:29.200]  dot com download those pdf documents and get them
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:32.560]  in front of your representative do not hesitate
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.480]  next week they will be back in district and they will be available to you so
[01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:40.640]  make it happen because if we lose this battle we lose it for a very very
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:47.360]  long time elaborate on how where's the lawsuit going how your
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:50.800]  colleague the co-author super prestigious i mean i looked him up like you
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:54.480]  said one of the top you know gastro experts
[01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:57.840]  in the uk or europe that's why they were so scared of you guys
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:00.960]  and had to shut you down as your smart will spoken prestigious
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:04.160]  getting results helping people had to be destroyed
[01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:07.760]  but they failed you came back like the phoenix and that's so exciting so
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.960]  she'll break down where that fight's going right now as well
[01:23:10.960 --> 01:23:14.720]  certainly let me start with john walker smith when the gmc rendered their
[01:23:14.720 --> 01:23:16.960]  opinion and had a their decision and had us
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:21.120]  struck off the medical register in the uk both doctor professor walker smith and
[01:23:21.120 --> 01:23:25.280]  i filed an appeal and i did not get funded for
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.200]  my appeal it would have cost me about 500 000 pounds which i didn't have
[01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:32.560]  to fight that appeal so i had to withdraw my because they destroyed your livelihood
[01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:36.640]  his was funded and he took it to the high court this was the first time
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:39.520]  it had ever been in front of a proper judiciary
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.640]  the judge just dismissing destroyed the gmc
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:46.880]  destroyed them he essentially accused them of being incompetent unable
[01:23:46.880 --> 01:23:50.480]  to incompetent unable to handle evidence they did not know how to
[01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:54.320]  they were he accused them of being biased they rejected evidence that was
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:57.680]  valid they had no idea what they were doing yes they did
[01:23:57.680 --> 01:24:00.320]  actually because they were doing it deliberately well they were setting you
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:03.040]  up they had been given their marching orders and they were going to get a
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.440]  guilty verdict whatever and at the end of it
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:09.760]  counsel on behalf of the gmc admitted said we're sorry
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:14.640]  we know the mistakes were made and we didn't handle this properly and the
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:17.920]  and the judge said it would be a shame if this were ever to happen
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:21.360]  again you go away and you change your whole process
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:25.680]  of conducting these fitness to practice inquiries so it was demolished
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:28.480]  however they got what they wanted and that was
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:32.400]  taking my license away and now autism rates have gone i mean i mean they vary
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:35.600]  the highest are in south korea correct me if i'm wrong looks like one in 30
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:38.960]  something it's 150 something here now was a one in 68
[01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:45.840]  it was one in 25 thousand 30 years ago i mean i can see the children when i'm
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:50.320]  at the grocery store or i'm out in public kids aren't looking too good
[01:24:50.320 --> 01:24:53.520]  uh and the babies aren't and i mean they go to a movie theater
[01:24:53.520 --> 01:24:57.280]  sometimes the thing is just full of autistic children
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:01.680]  god bless her little hearts you know babbling uh and and and
[01:25:01.680 --> 01:25:05.920]  just going through hell and i go to doctor's offices sometimes you know
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:09.200]  take my children to the pediatrician and i'll be in there and there's like 15
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:13.600]  kids and like five of them are autistic i mean this is an epidemic well is it
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.360]  going to be one in 10 one in five one in two i mean
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:22.160]  how long will this go how many i mean do it does half the population have to be
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:25.120]  sitting in the corner in diapers cussing when they're 15 years old
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:28.160]  screaming at their parents before we do something i think the way to look at this
[01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:33.040]  alex is look at the cdc's own numbers on this and look at the trend over time
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:36.720]  the uh it's it's now what as you say around one in 50
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:40.560]  if you extrapolate from that and you look at the risk for autism for a child
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:43.920]  born today it's one in 25 and it's estimated that by
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:50.000]  what 2025 we one in two children will have autism if nothing is done about it
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.920]  and that is completely the situation now is completely unacceptable
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:58.160]  but that will be a disaster no economy in the world can sustain that kind of
[01:25:58.160 --> 01:26:02.880]  attrition of its population so something has got to be
[01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:05.680]  done immediately well yeah something was done
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:08.640]  have you read eco science written by the current white house science czar i have
[01:26:08.640 --> 01:26:13.920]  not it's pretty interesting um they talk about social
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:19.040]  engineering through through um medical systems water and vaccines to uh
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:22.800]  get people in line pretty pretty interesting it was written by
[01:26:22.800 --> 01:26:27.040]  they think there's too many people paul r earlick annie h earlick and john p
[01:26:27.040 --> 01:26:31.200]  holdren and uh this book is digitally online for
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.520]  free they try to pull it down when people find it
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:36.800]  because it's pretty shocking this was basically adopted
[01:26:36.800 --> 01:26:42.720]  by unesco as a global shadow policy uh to carry out social engineering through
[01:26:42.720 --> 01:26:46.400]  medicine right we'll keep an eye on your copy alex
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:48.960]  come out to steal it before i go well you can borrow it you're certainly
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:52.880]  welcome to thank you but uh you know and the other issue is what
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:56.000]  happens okay there are two elements to this there's the epidemic that's
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.480]  occurring now and then there are the children who are already damaged what
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:02.240]  do we do about those children as they age out and they become
[01:27:02.240 --> 01:27:07.360]  adults as you say sitting in diapers at the age of 15 20 25
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.720]  unable to cope unable to deal with themselves and we had a tragic case
[01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:14.720]  here in austin the other day of a young man who was in a group home in the
[01:27:14.720 --> 01:27:18.240]  district in the community and a simple thing happened i think
[01:27:18.240 --> 01:27:21.120]  someone stood on a dvd of his he had a meltdown
[01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:24.800]  he went running around the district knocking on doors and he was shot four
[01:27:24.800 --> 01:27:28.240]  times shot to death that these people cannot
[01:27:28.240 --> 01:27:32.240]  cope in the community they have no it's scary one of 25 year old autistic
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:35.120]  man's at your door and we're sad he got shot but i mean
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:38.560]  and cops are shooting them all the time too because you get some guy running at
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:41.520]  you screaming i mean it's nobody understands the problem this is the
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.560]  problem people out there in the community do not understand what autism
[01:27:44.560 --> 01:27:47.040]  is or that these individuals have no sense of
[01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:50.400]  danger whatsoever so what are we going to do with all of
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:54.960]  these autistic adults and that's a tragedy and someone here in austin
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:59.440]  polytomy is creating the autism trust to provide a long-term home for these
[01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:02.640]  individuals where they won't be drugged they won't be simply put on
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:06.800]  psychotropic medications which have no indication in autism whatsoever but
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:10.720]  make life easier for the carers i think i met him out in lakeway
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:15.360]  it poly is uh you probably met her husband her husband and wife team and
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.360]  he was showing me all the stuff they're going to build the campus
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:21.920]  absolutely that's right so um it's it's an exciting time for people here in
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:24.960]  austin but one of these places is not going to be anywhere near enough you
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:28.400]  could deal with you can have 10 or 15 austin alone let alone the rest of
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:33.280]  texas or the country well i know a lot of personal friends
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:37.040]  some quite famous people as well i mean you'll be on the phone with them
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:40.720]  and you know their kids in the background going just over and over and
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:45.200]  screaming at them i mean for hour after hour after hour i mean it is
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.000]  i couldn't think of a way to debilitate a society better
[01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:51.680]  we'll be back with a conclusion of this important interview with dr andrew
[01:28:51.680 --> 01:28:54.240]  wakefield then we'll talk to the former top

[01:33:18.480 --> 01:33:30.720]  n radio network
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:34.960]  dr wakefield again we salute you for your groundbreaking work
[01:33:34.960 --> 01:33:38.800]  and you know galileo said that the earth wasn't the center of the world and they
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:41.760]  locked him up for the rest of his life so we haven't gotten to that level though
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:45.680]  they've been trying and so so we appreciate you alex thank you very
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:48.560]  much it's great to be back i think you're absolutely right what we're looking
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:51.440]  at is a system that is in meltdown right now and
[01:33:51.440 --> 01:33:54.960]  they're in meltdown for a number of reasons you can only sustain
[01:33:54.960 --> 01:33:57.840]  a lie a falsehood for so long and now that
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:01.680]  dr william thompson senior cdc scientists has come forward
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:06.240]  and said that they have known for 13 years that m mr vaccine is causally
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:08.480]  associated with autism and they have hidden it
[01:34:08.480 --> 01:34:12.480]  from the public from doctors from public health officials
[01:34:12.480 --> 01:34:16.880]  from everybody they've kept it to an inner circle of people who knew the truth
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:21.520]  all along and have allowed millions of children to be put in harm's way
[01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:25.040]  in the interim and he could no longer live with that and he's come forward with
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:28.720]  that now and one has to hope that that goes
[01:34:28.720 --> 01:34:32.480]  before a congressional committee sooner rather than later and if i have one
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:35.920]  message for your listeners and your viewers it is that you
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:40.320]  must implore that your congressman take this very very
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:44.240]  seriously and support congressman bill posies efforts to get this before a
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:48.480]  committee just as soon as possible
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:53.040]  looking at this now they're doubling down it's like we're jews and nazi germany
[01:34:53.040 --> 01:34:57.040]  that we don't want to get vaccinated arrest us publish our names where we
[01:34:57.040 --> 01:35:00.720]  live come after us take our children i mean they're
[01:35:00.720 --> 01:35:03.920]  really doubling down it's desperate isn't it and it's rather
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:07.520]  like Salem or more recently as you point out it's rather like banning
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:11.920]  the nazis banning jews from using public transportation in order to avoid
[01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:15.600]  being contaminated by suspected infection i mean it's
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:17.920]  absolutely oh that's what they said yeah you're
[01:35:17.920 --> 01:35:21.360]  right so we're seeing that kind of reaction now
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:25.840]  to uh what's happening and it's very well orchestrated
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:29.440]  it's heavily funded with billions of dollars of public relations fund and
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:33.040]  it's failing it's failing because it's a lie
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:37.120]  and if you have a vaccination policy in this country which mandates
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:40.960]  which takes your children away which puts you at gunpoint which puts parents
[01:35:40.960 --> 01:35:44.720]  in prison for not vaccinating that is not built upon public trust or
[01:35:44.720 --> 01:35:48.400]  confidence that is a disaster and public
[01:35:48.400 --> 01:35:53.280]  health policy vaccination policy requires the confidence of the public
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:56.080]  and they have lost it wow this is epic think about it
[01:35:56.080 --> 01:35:59.120]  in america and europe they're trying to make vaccines
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:02.400]  forced and they're coming out with hundreds of new ones where companies
[01:36:02.400 --> 01:36:05.440]  lobby and then government says it's the law to take it
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:08.480]  they tried to have rick perry a few years ago run the hoax of saying it was the
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:11.920]  law with the garter cell i mean there's no there's no
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:15.440]  in to the depths and as you said i'm here following and i'm here talking to the
[01:36:15.440 --> 01:36:19.120]  public they're doubling tripling down it is backfiring
[01:36:19.120 --> 01:36:24.000]  but it shows this totalitarian instinct that now permeates government
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:29.200]  yeah that's the notion of treating or protecting children against serious
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:32.880]  infectious disease with safe and effective vaccines
[01:36:32.880 --> 01:36:36.160]  is a laudable one we know we both reckon i want them
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:40.400]  absolutely but the current schedule and certainly m mr meets none of those
[01:36:40.400 --> 01:36:45.120]  criteria none at all and uh we have a major major
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:48.640]  problem let me characterize this um there are measles
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:52.000]  outbreaks apparently now in california and elsewhere
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.480]  m mr vaccine measles mumps rubella vaccine does not protect against measles
[01:36:56.480 --> 01:37:01.120]  measles vaccine protects against measles and the only recommendation that i have
[01:37:01.120 --> 01:37:05.280]  ever made in respect of m mr is to give them separately
[01:37:05.280 --> 01:37:09.200]  and delay them so that you have a an interval between each that's what the
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:12.240]  japanese have done for 20 years well the japanese are an extremely good
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.640]  example because the japanese had m mr they don't want a bunch of brain
[01:37:16.640 --> 01:37:19.920]  damaged children when m mr came in in japan there was a
[01:37:19.920 --> 01:37:24.320]  dramatic rise in the incidence of autism what they found is that the
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:29.200]  vaccine caused meningitis the mumps strain of the vaccine caused meningitis
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:32.320]  public confidence was lost and the vaccine was stopped
[01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:36.000]  and the backs the uptake of of the vaccine and the decline in the use of
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:40.080]  the vaccine exactly mirrors the rising and falling incidents
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:45.360]  of autism now what happened next was that there was a rebound a dramatic
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:49.600]  rebound in the incidence of autism it went up skyrocketed why they never used
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:53.280]  m mr again but what the vaccine policy recommendation
[01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:57.520]  was in japan was to use to give children at 12 months
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:01.760]  the measles and rubella vaccine on the same day
[01:38:01.760 --> 01:38:06.480]  and to give voluntary mumps vaccination not less than four weeks later now that
[01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:11.040]  in many ways is still giving combination viral vaccines
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:15.520]  so you're recapitulating the same problem that you have with m mr now
[01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:20.240]  the kicker is alex that the single mumps vaccine the one that
[01:38:20.240 --> 01:38:24.400]  caused meningitis when it was given on its own caused little or no meningitis
[01:38:24.400 --> 01:38:28.160]  at all it was when it was put into the m mr
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:31.360]  that there was an unacceptable level of meningitis what does that tell us it
[01:38:31.360 --> 01:38:34.720]  tells us that you get a novel unexpected
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:38.000]  adverse event associated with the combination vaccine
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:41.440]  that you did not get with a single thing and you studied this but the dr
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:45.760]  blalock who's coined a lot of terms that are now in mainline medical journals
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:49.360]  says that there's a basically an adjuvant effect of mixing them together
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:54.240]  it just makes them many times more powerful uh mixing them or what is it
[01:38:54.240 --> 01:38:58.000]  it certainly alters their behavior and this was recognized as soon as they
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:01.280]  were put together it's called viral interference
[01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:05.120]  and they were concerned that it influences the protective immune response
[01:39:05.120 --> 01:39:09.200]  there was no concern whatsoever except amongst the Japanese
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:13.200]  about safety no concern you cannot take three
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:16.400]  live viral agents and put them into combination
[01:39:16.400 --> 01:39:20.240]  and just expect that one and one and one equal three they don't be and i saw
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:22.560]  they're now coming out with some vaccines they're floating that has many
[01:39:22.560 --> 01:39:26.000]  as 10 yes now there were they for example with the live viral
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:29.360]  vaccines they put in the chickenpox vaccine when they did that it doubled
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:33.600]  the rate of febrile convulsions there again is a classic example of
[01:39:33.600 --> 01:39:38.160]  more is not better but these inserts say they can give you convulsions so
[01:39:38.160 --> 01:39:41.760]  so so why are we being attacked when the insert says all this
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:46.000]  i wonder how many patients or parents actually get to see that insert
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.440]  alex i wonder how many people ask for it and i wonder how many doctors
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:53.360]  spontaneously show it and as part of the informed consent process
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:57.360]  very very few well we told folks that there were some tips on to win the
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:40:00.880]  lottery in here maybe fantasy football they might read it but i mean if i was
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:03.040]  going to put any drug i'm gonna put in my body
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:07.040]  i don't care what it is antibiotics anything i go read the insert
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:10.720]  you ought to know what's in there this is just crazy and for those that don't
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:13.200]  know each vial of the mmr any other vaccine or
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:17.600]  drug in the box with it by law comes this so they have this
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:22.640]  at walgreens at cbs i think parents need the choice they need the choice in the
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:26.000]  presence of the current concerns about the safety of mmr vaccine
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:28.960]  they must have a choice of how to protect their children
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:32.320]  against infectious disease well i know you're here warning people and you know
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:36.480]  as a doctor and you're trying to save folks but but tell us about
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:40.000]  your story recapping it briefly where it is where your lawsuit is
[01:40:40.000 --> 01:40:43.680]  your co-author being exonerated i know you're moving towards that you've been
[01:40:43.680 --> 01:40:47.040]  exonerated with the whistleblowers the previous studies but this has got a
[01:40:47.040 --> 01:40:49.440]  really hurt the people that tried to destroy you
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:53.040]  uh as just fate would have it all this evidence pours out
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:40:56.560]  well alex i've been in this 20 years now and that's a feels like
[01:40:56.560 --> 01:41:00.960]  many many lifetimes but we listened to parents who said that my child was
[01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:04.640]  perfectly normal i'm not anti-vaccine i took my child to get vaccinated
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:08.160]  when i did that they got the mmr and they regressed into autism
[01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:11.920]  and uh they also developed gastrointestinal symptoms and as a physician
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:16.000]  interested in gastrointestinal disease i recommended those children
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:19.360]  should get investigated for that they were investigated by the world's
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:21.840]  leading pediatric gastroenterologist at the time
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:25.840]  professor walker smith who you've just mentioned my co-author on the paper
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:29.200]  and he found that they had an inflammatory bowel disease we treated
[01:41:29.200 --> 01:41:33.120]  that disease not only did the bowel disease symptoms improve
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:36.800]  but the behavioral and autistic symptoms improved it was the beginning of a
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:40.560]  fascinating journey but we had to investigate
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:44.320]  whether the parents were also right about whether the vaccine had precipitated
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:46.800]  and this word that's when the problem started
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:51.120]  and so murdochs uh bought his team of journalists along brian dear they came
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:55.600]  up with this extraordinary story uh that we had involved ourselves in
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:59.040]  fraud and deception that we had made it up there was no ethical
[01:41:59.040 --> 01:42:02.320]  approval all of this kind of thing while at the same time
[01:42:02.320 --> 01:42:07.120]  holding back from the general medical council inquiry vital documents
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:10.560]  that showed there was indeed ethical approval for this study he knew
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:14.320]  throughout the investigation and the proceedings that he had in his
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:18.720]  possession key documents that was an obstruction of justice have you ever
[01:42:18.720 --> 01:42:22.720]  physically been around this guy i was you i i bet you get angry
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:26.880]  i get angry but you know um it's it's not about me
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:30.240]  it's not about me alex no i know but i mean this guy's trying to cover up what's
[01:42:30.240 --> 01:42:32.720]  going on with children he's a despicable character in my
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.720]  opinion yeah one thing i cannot forgive him for is the
[01:42:34.720 --> 01:42:37.920]  damage done to the children because now we are many many years on
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:41.760]  and because the bowel disease in the minds of many was synonymous with vaccine

[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:23.920]  music
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:33.920]  live from austin texas it's alex jones
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:39.680]  former general counsel the federal communications commission uniquely
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:44.160]  positioned to be able to really tell us what's going on
[01:47:44.160 --> 01:47:49.120]  i've never seen behavior like i've seen uh from the executive and then the
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:53.200]  republican leadership seems to roll over because they're licking their lips i
[01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:57.600]  guess to have all this power when they get a president in charge so again i'm
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:02.320]  worried about an imperial presidency not even so much obama but i am shocked
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:06.560]  by the left that if bush was trying something like this you would have just
[01:48:06.560 --> 01:48:12.720]  heard howls and and now they say hey you know a lot of make obama a dictator
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:16.800]  he can give us some free stuff then uh just incredible political ignorance so
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:23.520]  so please finish up on that mr fine it's very very important uh alex in a
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:27.360]  democratic country like ours you know that we have government in the sunshine
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:30.560]  there are a few things that need to be secret location of truth but relatively
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:35.040]  few transparency sunshine is said to be the best disinfectant so we have a
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:38.160]  right to know what our government is doing how can we give consent
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:43.200]  to a government that's acting in secret and so the whole idea that's in and
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:46.800]  when i was working as counsel on iran contract committee
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:51.120]  this is uh during reagan uh period i mean president reagan was having
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:54.880]  secretary of state george shulls testifies national security advisor was
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:00.080]  testifying cap windberg was testifying secretary of defense it was open in
[01:49:00.080 --> 01:49:04.000]  the sunshine this is president reagan and now we have people like you know
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.840]  chair of the fdc i don't want to answer questions i don't want to show up
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:11.520]  well the congress should be telling you one if you don't show up
[01:49:11.520 --> 01:49:16.080]  we will impeach and remove you from office because you have an obligation
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:19.440]  to explain to the american people what you're doing and why because
[01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:23.760]  you are there representative you work for them
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:28.080]  not for obama you work for we the people who are sovereign and if they
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:31.360]  are recalculated they should impeach them or find them
[01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:35.280]  50 000 100 000 every day that they don't appear
[01:49:35.280 --> 01:49:39.280]  and you're right it's stunning congresses will please tell us you know
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:44.240]  they ring their hand and do nothing so they get they get treated you know like
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:48.240]  their second and third tier players because they simply won't stand up and
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:51.520]  defend their authorities but maybe you're right they just waiting for the
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:54.960]  white house so that they can be the oppressors rather than the oppressed
[01:49:54.960 --> 01:50:00.240]  but that's not a very optimistic outlook for the future of the country and i
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:03.920]  don't want to be oppressed by anybody in the white exactly democrat
[01:50:03.920 --> 01:50:07.840]  well also they they promised to release the 332 pages
[01:50:07.840 --> 01:50:12.000]  as soon as they announced it and then they haven't released it or now
[01:50:12.000 --> 01:50:18.080]  have the washington post making fun of anybody that asked to see it when we
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:21.840]  know they printed it up in book form and they've been waving it around on tv
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:26.160]  for a month with this red tape around it so i guess if they don't testify to
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:29.040]  congress why ever release it they can be like the cia
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:33.120]  will just be secret yeah i mean and say secret government is
[01:50:33.120 --> 01:50:36.880]  antithetical to anything like representative of democracy
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:40.240]  how can you have a government that doesn't even tell you what it's doing
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:44.640]  after we get to decide to approve or disapprove what's being done here they
[01:50:44.640 --> 01:50:48.560]  don't get the issue by decree you know their elections and things can change
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:52.800]  and it is this arrogance that's that's totally antithetical to what our
[01:50:52.800 --> 01:50:57.760]  founding fathers thought you know a free and open government would be about
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:01.840]  other points where do you expect this to go the hill
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:05.520]  and i think rightly says that this has to go through a gauntlet
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:08.320]  these rules and that that's why they're not releasing them
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:11.520]  so i guess they think they want to win the propaganda war that they're
[01:51:11.520 --> 01:51:15.760]  protecting the internet before they roll this out by stealth
[01:51:15.760 --> 01:51:19.600]  but that isn't working for obama care because as they roll it out it becomes
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:24.880]  more unpopular by the day so why are they engaging in this tactic
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:29.840]  or maybe trying to bolster their defenses against what's sure to be
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:33.280]  a legal attack on the net neutrality rules
[01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:36.800]  and the court of appeals here in the u.s court of appeals in the district of
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:40.560]  columbia has rebuked the f60 on numerous occasions for
[01:51:40.560 --> 01:51:44.480]  overreach they need to be worried that the
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:48.960]  shallowness of their explanations need busting before
[01:51:48.960 --> 01:51:53.040]  they're going to be an immediate appeal and perhaps in my expectation alex
[01:51:53.040 --> 01:51:59.360]  would be that they'll be a stay of the fdc rules until
[01:51:59.360 --> 01:52:02.240]  there's a final court adjudication which means there's
[01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:05.840]  years away given the legal frailty of their
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:08.480]  promulgation
[01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:12.480]  what do you think is going to happen in your gut i mean the sense of congress
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:16.640]  the sense of the country the sense of the other administrators and lawyers you
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:19.920]  talk to which way is this country going because it seems to be
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:26.320]  stampeding into an accelerated decline of the roman empire
[01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:30.240]  meets buck rogers in your gut where do you think this country in the world's
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:36.080]  going bruce fine you know what we need is to restore
[01:52:36.080 --> 01:52:41.280]  our fundamental precepts as a country which hasn't changed in over 200 years
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:44.960]  human nature hasn't changed you know the the empire
[01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:50.480]  psychology hasn't changed and we have in i think alex anywhere from
[01:52:50.480 --> 01:52:55.040]  30 maybe 35 years to completely reorient
[01:52:55.040 --> 01:52:59.040]  ourselves as a country whose influence abroad is the influence of example we
[01:52:59.040 --> 01:53:02.400]  need to restore separation of powers back home
[01:53:02.400 --> 01:53:07.120]  transparency we defend ourselves but we don't go abroad in search of monsters
[01:53:07.120 --> 01:53:11.440]  to destroy by 18 19 20 trillion dollars running around the
[01:53:11.440 --> 01:53:15.280]  world like don quixote thinking that we can change cultures that are
[01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:18.560]  a thousand five thousand years old if ethnic
[01:53:18.560 --> 01:53:22.480]  you know the arrival reason and despotism and the democracies
[01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:27.120]  you can't do it you know if you could you know those people who believe that
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:31.120]  alex i say let's hire me build a perpetual motion machine
[01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:35.440]  it's truly stunning failure after failure afghanistan fails
[01:53:35.440 --> 01:53:40.400]  yemen fails iraq fails syria fails nowhere libya fails all of it
[01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:42.720]  they keep coming back and doing the same thing
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:46.640]  i mean after the libya is a perfect example you got 126 militias the whole
[01:53:46.640 --> 01:53:50.480]  thing is is a Somalia like desert land and now we're going to visit the you
[01:53:50.480 --> 01:53:54.320]  know and remember libya and yemen were viewed as the model
[01:53:54.320 --> 01:53:58.080]  that obama singled out for pursuing ices
[01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:02.160]  i mean my god the model that's like saying you know general custer's lab
[01:54:02.160 --> 01:54:05.760]  battle the little big orange is the model by which we'll fight the future
[01:54:05.760 --> 01:54:09.040]  indian wars you say my god are you crazy
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:13.360]  and we need to just totally repudiate this idea that
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:17.280]  we have some kind of obligation and expertise to cure all the ills in the
[01:54:17.280 --> 01:54:20.960]  world nice if it was possible we will destroy ourselves as a
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:24.400]  consequence well i think this might be was ran but if we can get ran power on
[01:54:24.400 --> 01:54:27.520]  that philosophy back into the trajectory of where we're
[01:54:27.520 --> 01:54:31.440]  going as a country we can save ourselves otherwise we're following the
[01:54:31.440 --> 01:54:35.040]  path to the roman empire it'll be just a matter of time we'll bankrupt
[01:54:35.040 --> 01:54:38.960]  ourselves we'll still overextend ourselves we'll ultimately collapse
[01:54:38.960 --> 01:54:43.040]  well i agree with you and in closing you notice that
[01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:47.280]  ran paul won the c-pack pole and he's nowhere in the news and then they have
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:50.880]  a whisper campaign libertarian movement oh he's not perfect
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:55.360]  you know he's not his dad uh so we better not supporting he's the best in the
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:57.840]  field that's why the power structure is coming
[01:54:57.840 --> 01:55:01.040]  after him and ignoring him folks i want you to briefly comment on that because
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:04.080]  you got to go and then also have you heard about the london garden our
[01:55:04.080 --> 01:55:06.800]  reporters have been up there there's a giant five story
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:09.920]  and then a four story and a three story complex
[01:55:09.920 --> 01:55:13.920]  with black sites where people died where people are kept for up to two days
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:17.360]  shackled and aren't even put in the arrest database

[01:55:54.880 --> 01:55:59.040]  attacked because he's challenging military industrial complex that

[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:07.440]  uh so they'll be making up all sorts of things about rand and trying to
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:11.600]  obscure his popularity uh and we need to remember too
