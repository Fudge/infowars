[08:42.000 --> 08:49.480]  our reporters Paul Joseph Watson David Knight Josh Owens and others are on the
[08:49.480 --> 08:55.800]  ground in Copenhagen Denmark for Bilderberg 2014 as the world discovers
[08:55.800 --> 09:01.240]  our overlords and our illegitimate rulers they want us to stay focused on the
[09:01.240 --> 09:06.360]  puppets the front men but we're going to spotlight the real power behind the
[09:06.360 --> 09:11.040]  throne the man behind the curtain the men behind the curtain the women behind
[09:11.040 --> 09:19.360]  the curtain that are eugenicist globalist anti-human garbage who are the
[09:19.360 --> 09:26.840]  progenitors the creators of people like the Nazis and modern communism as we
[09:26.840 --> 09:32.400]  know it they are the old oligarchs the robber barons the great-grandchildren of
[09:32.400 --> 09:37.160]  the robber barons and the British and Dutch and German royalty and the Roth
[09:37.160 --> 09:44.200]  Childs they are the power elite and they see you and I as total scum animals who
[09:44.200 --> 09:48.240]  have no rights and are here to be usurped by them and now our labor's cheap in
[09:48.240 --> 09:52.280]  fact it's worthless they've got robots they've got computers they say they're
[09:52.280 --> 09:56.880]  done with us now they're just busy slowing the economy turning off the
[09:56.880 --> 10:01.120]  economy to get control of us politically to domesticate us for the
[10:01.120 --> 10:11.160]  orderly reclamation or spiking the wrecking the demolition of humanity as
[10:11.160 --> 10:16.040]  we know it every statistic shows it every number shows it the system isn't
[10:16.040 --> 10:21.320]  failed it's designed to implode but there's still good people in the system
[10:21.320 --> 10:25.400]  there's still part of the old system that wasn't perfect but is wonderful
[10:25.400 --> 10:30.920]  compared to this and there's renaissance new systems as well that are all in
[10:30.920 --> 10:35.640]  competition with each other the globalist worldwide have control of
[10:35.640 --> 10:40.200]  central banking and the issuance of fractional reserve banking for every
[10:40.200 --> 10:45.440]  euro for every dollar they are able to loan out under the old system ten
[10:45.440 --> 10:53.400]  dollars under derivatives of the last 50 years and other paper frauds they are
[10:53.400 --> 10:59.840]  able to loan out thousands of times per dollar what they have and then they hope
[10:59.840 --> 11:04.640]  you go bankrupt because then they get your real assets they get you they get
[11:04.640 --> 11:12.840]  your soul because we're sold out to money and to them it's literally nothing
[11:12.840 --> 11:19.400]  but garbage that they create of nothing in fact there was an article on Monday I
[11:19.400 --> 11:22.600]  meant to cover that was so chilling when you guys reprinted for me it was a
[11:22.600 --> 11:28.120]  headline it was also the Jerusalem post but I think the one I had was from it
[11:28.120 --> 11:35.520]  was zero hedge it was Israel to become first cashless nation and then I was
[11:35.520 --> 11:39.880]  reading through the article there's nothing more hellish for control than
[11:39.880 --> 11:44.880]  cashless oh it's very convenient it's very easy oh you just have it on your
[11:44.880 --> 11:48.280]  key fob you don't have to keep track of it the problem is they're going to put
[11:48.280 --> 11:52.160]  fines and fees and regulations on it it's going to kill the underground markets
[11:52.160 --> 12:01.880]  and it's going to create a nightmare system of absolute total control in fact
[12:01.880 --> 12:05.720]  they found the headline there it is zero hedge government plan would
[12:05.720 --> 12:12.920]  transfer Israel into the world's first cashless society and they're selling it
[12:12.920 --> 12:18.440]  like it's a wonderful thing it could not be more hellish that's why more and more
[12:18.440 --> 12:24.600]  I'm getting cash to pay for dinners I'm getting cash to pay for bonuses I mean
[12:24.600 --> 12:29.640]  we ended to take it out of the bank post IRS tax the private fellow reserve so
[12:29.640 --> 12:34.200]  the tax is even paid on it but I'm paying people in cash in some cases show
[12:34.200 --> 12:42.920]  that we can keep cash alive because cash is already digital the new US money has
[12:42.920 --> 12:49.040]  tracker numbers on it and it's got RFID they can read from a distance but the
[12:49.040 --> 12:53.640]  elite themselves rich families and others are hoarding golden cash it is so
[12:53.640 --> 12:56.960]  important to keep cash ladies and gentlemen because it allows the globalist
[12:56.960 --> 13:01.000]  that run the narcotics and all the corrupt operations to exempt themselves
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.960]  in the digital systems I'm sure you've noticed that you never see the big banks
[13:05.960 --> 13:09.520]  getting busted for publicly laundering trillions of drug money every year or
[13:09.520 --> 13:13.120]  owning the drug aircraft as Wells Fargo's been caught doing with Wacovia
[13:13.120 --> 13:18.600]  because they're literally above the law so no amount of cashless society know
[13:18.600 --> 13:23.560]  your customer garbage is is is there to keep a saver stop terrorism it's there
[13:23.560 --> 13:31.120]  to selectively shut down our society and then totally destroy their competition
[13:31.120 --> 13:36.520]  because only again the globalist will be exempt you won't be exempt so you can't
[13:36.520 --> 13:39.840]  exempt yourself and go to the black market or the underground economy that
[13:39.840 --> 13:44.520]  keeps authoritarian societies going and by that it doesn't keep the
[13:44.520 --> 13:49.080]  authoritarians going it keeps people in authoritarian society from being
[13:49.080 --> 13:53.920]  completely destroyed when you have a lawless criminal government it becomes
[13:53.920 --> 13:59.880]  a duty to not follow the criminal laws it becomes a duty to not pay the taxes it
[13:59.880 --> 14:06.360]  becomes a duty to not comply and I've never really said you know don't pay
[14:06.360 --> 14:11.880]  the taxes but when it comes to Obamacare it's now time to not do it it's a death
[14:11.880 --> 14:16.800]  panel it's an abortion funding system it's an infanticide eugenics system it's
[14:16.800 --> 14:22.000]  kill grandma system on record it's don't give cancer patients treatment that's
[14:22.000 --> 14:30.080]  NBC News today look at this headline children as young as five labeled
[14:30.080 --> 14:36.600]  suspicious by Florida police as they put them in databases that's how to fusion
[14:36.600 --> 14:44.240]  net one of the big police sites I mean this country is just a total joke what
[14:44.240 --> 14:48.200]  about listing the globalist as suspicious what about listing powerful
[14:48.200 --> 14:53.720]  elites as suspicious oh they don't exist remember
[14:53.720 --> 15:00.200]  remember there's no secret elites meeting with government officials to set
[15:00.200 --> 15:05.480]  policy oops we exposed it we've gotten the documents time and time again now
[15:05.480 --> 15:09.080]  Bilderberg admits they exist that they're more powerful than Dave us that
[15:09.080 --> 15:13.520]  they are setting policy and they've told that to major German newspapers and you
[15:13.520 --> 15:18.120]  can just put it in the pipe and smoke it they don't care really what they're
[15:18.120 --> 15:20.920]  doing is acting like they don't care and acting like they're powerful and
[15:20.920 --> 15:25.920]  and untouchable because they're totally scared they are running scared and I
[15:25.920 --> 15:30.760]  have the stack of Bilderberg news here in front of me let me just read these
[15:30.760 --> 15:35.680]  headlines ahead of David Knight joining us we caught video of general Petraeus
[15:35.680 --> 15:40.600]  going for a jog at Bilderberg 2014 on the waterfront they have completely
[15:40.600 --> 15:45.520]  fenced off general Petraeus CIA head and former general Petraeus was seen
[15:45.520 --> 15:49.680]  exiting the Marriott Hotel and jogging down the street being chased by info
[15:49.680 --> 15:53.600]  wars reporters and again our guys confirmed it was Petraeus it was in
[15:53.600 --> 15:56.920]  the Bilderberg area it's hard to pick up on the camera but if you blow it up you
[15:56.920 --> 16:03.800]  can see that it's see that it's Petraeus continuing we have a photo gallery at
[16:03.800 --> 16:07.200]  info wars dot com of people being arrested and other such things at
[16:07.200 --> 16:15.160]  Bilderberg 20 2014 protesters being arrested the police aren't messing with
[16:15.160 --> 16:18.960]  you unless you cause a disturbance and I had some provocateur getting in our
[16:18.960 --> 16:23.800]  reporter's faces and they got drug off photos of that a lot more and then
[16:23.800 --> 16:28.840]  putting up weird black film on the window so you can't even see in oh well
[16:28.840 --> 16:31.880]  there's nothing nothing being hidden though it doesn't exist the New York
[16:31.880 --> 16:37.760]  Times said that I literally you know said it was imaginary in 2008 again
[16:37.760 --> 16:41.520]  mainstream media is beginning to cover Bilderberg CNBC as the headline
[16:41.520 --> 16:45.760]  Bilderberg conference spy CEOs and politicians gather under independent
[16:45.760 --> 16:50.200]  ask is it a conspiracy that they're involved in inside oh from us being
[16:50.200 --> 16:54.760]  conspiracy theorists to is it a criminal conspiracy London evening
[16:54.760 --> 17:02.320]  standard Ed steers clear Bilderberg group we've got other reports Bilderberg at
[17:02.320 --> 17:07.760]  60 insides the world's most secretive conference that's the London Guardian and
[17:07.760 --> 17:13.320]  we have all that big exclusive live feeds and more at info wars dot com and
[17:13.320 --> 17:19.160]  prison planet dot com but here is the specific article if you're watching us
[17:19.160 --> 17:24.080]  on television out of the Guardian that's that's a big report by Charlie
[17:24.080 --> 17:31.440]  Skelton Bilderberg at 60 inside the world's most secretive conference so
[17:31.440 --> 17:38.040]  massive coverage now in the foreign dinosaur press and now even some
[17:38.040 --> 17:44.960]  coverage in the controlled press here in the United States so that is
[17:44.960 --> 17:52.800]  certainly some extremely positive news here's RT the Russian news NATO chief
[17:52.800 --> 18:00.160]  former US intelligence director among Bilderberg elite meeting right now zero
[18:00.160 --> 18:06.000]  hedge is covering it as well we have to again thank drudge report dot com every
[18:06.000 --> 18:11.160]  year there's not a lot of coverage till drudge picks up the list from us and
[18:11.160 --> 18:15.400]  then picks up some of the other reports we put out that's the pattern it
[18:15.400 --> 18:19.880]  follows and then a day later it's so embarrassing to the dinosaur media that
[18:19.880 --> 18:23.160]  even though they ignore it everyone's seeing live video feeds they're seeing
[18:23.160 --> 18:26.840]  videos they're seeing photos they're seeing Bilderberg security say yes we're

[24:36.440 --> 24:42.920]  there's a new article out that if you are a pessimist you are three times more
[24:42.920 --> 24:50.400]  likely to have dementia and basically get Alzheimer's being a scenic link to
[24:50.400 --> 24:56.120]  triple risk of developing dementia Finland study finds that's in the
[24:56.120 --> 25:04.320]  financial times of London and the national post as well and the reason I
[25:04.320 --> 25:08.040]  start the segment with that information before I get into really bad news is I'm
[25:08.040 --> 25:13.880]  not being a pessimist and a defeatist I'm admitting the bad in the world because
[25:13.880 --> 25:17.840]  I believe in good men and women standing up against it and changing and
[25:17.840 --> 25:22.240]  making this a better world I'm an optimist people always say man you must
[25:22.240 --> 25:26.440]  be paranoid and scared no no I challenge the corrupt in the evil I have
[25:26.440 --> 25:32.440]  courage I don't imagine people are after me I know there's always been corrupt
[25:32.440 --> 25:37.120]  elites where they don't even think about other people and they just want total
[25:37.120 --> 25:42.880]  control and I'm here saying no that's not the way this is gonna be we're gonna
[25:42.880 --> 25:46.120]  admit there's a global elite that are tyrannical we're gonna admit there's a
[25:46.120 --> 25:50.240]  gen 21 to shut down our economy and consolidate it in the hands of a few that
[25:50.240 --> 25:53.440]  are exempt from the regulations we're gonna admit there's a move to
[25:53.440 --> 25:57.000]  militarize police and use the military against the American people and they're
[25:57.000 --> 26:00.320]  deploying armored vehicles and tanks and helicopters and drones and we're gonna
[26:00.320 --> 26:03.960]  show the documents and we're gonna have a public debate about it and we're gonna
[26:03.960 --> 26:08.520]  say no to it or even if they try to stage a false flag and use the military
[26:08.520 --> 26:13.040]  against us the military is gonna be so awake because we've been targeting them
[26:13.040 --> 26:18.520]  with the truth openly that they're not gonna go along with the narrative that's
[26:18.520 --> 26:25.160]  called check putting the globalist in check then it's their move next and
[26:25.160 --> 26:29.660]  here's the article up at info wars.com I've told a Don Salazar I've told
[26:29.660 --> 26:34.240]  Kurt Nemo I've told Kit Daniels I've told all of our writers that are here to
[26:34.240 --> 26:37.960]  cover this from their own angle but to point to all our research and all of our
[26:37.960 --> 26:41.320]  documents because as good as this Bill Gertz article is and it's excellent and
[26:41.320 --> 26:47.160]  it's up at drudgerport.com LinkedIn red Department of Defense directive number
[26:47.160 --> 26:58.120]  3,225.18 just now declassified December 29 2010 defense support for civil

[27:23.720 --> 27:26.840]  been telling you because again I'm gonna say this again if we have a debate
[27:26.840 --> 27:31.680]  about this and then point out oh by the way in the manuals it's not just
[27:31.680 --> 27:34.760]  domestic war they're preparing for and civil unrest it's with the Tea Party
[27:34.760 --> 27:38.480]  returning veterans gun owners conservatives libertarians that's about
[27:38.480 --> 27:43.880]  half the country this is treason it's illegal and if there's a debate about
[27:43.880 --> 27:48.200]  it the public learns the military is being prepared for war and that the
[27:48.200 --> 27:50.960]  military is being prepared the Tea Party is gonna blow up federal buildings

[36:54.800 --> 37:00.440]  so much for joining us on this Thursday edition we have David Knight about to
[37:00.440 --> 37:03.880]  join us with live video feeds from Copenhagen Denmark we've blown
[37:03.880 --> 37:11.720]  Bilderberg 2014 wide open yet again now they're like big deal big deal have a
[37:11.720 --> 37:17.080]  bit of Bilderberg covers yeah we kind of run things the global government I mean
[37:17.080 --> 37:21.920]  we always admitted that move along nothing to see here after they tried to
[37:21.920 --> 37:31.560]  move heaven and earth to not have a debate about this now I want to go back
[37:31.560 --> 37:35.800]  to this article and then today the night this is such a big deal by Bill Gertz
[37:35.800 --> 37:42.840]  it's up on info wars.com in fact I want to post the PDF on info wars.com under
[37:42.840 --> 37:47.000]  the Bill Gertz article with screenshots and as I said post the whole Bill Gertz
[37:47.000 --> 37:51.280]  article from Washington Times.com on info wars.com it's that important to
[37:51.280 --> 37:55.600]  mirror this document that that they receive and have confirmed as the
[37:55.600 --> 38:07.520]  Department of Defense number 3025.18 and it's been updated in September of 2012
[38:07.520 --> 38:12.960]  now released and here's the article inside the ring directive outlines
[38:12.960 --> 38:19.240]  Obama's plan to use military against citizens they've got North com they're
[38:19.240 --> 38:22.720]  training for it constantly it's in the training manual separately that we
[38:22.720 --> 38:27.440]  freak out about that they train that's even in Forbes magazine it's even in AP
[38:27.440 --> 38:33.360]  for who the Tea Party the military doesn't train for the Russians or the
[38:33.360 --> 38:37.440]  Chinese they train domestically that you know when they were building it they
[38:37.440 --> 38:44.440]  claimed for al-Qaeda to the globalist publicly run and protect and now
[38:44.440 --> 38:50.080]  they're segwaying going you know what it's actually for godowners and veterans
[38:50.080 --> 38:56.000]  yep the troubling aspect of the directive reading from Bill Gertz's
[38:56.000 --> 39:00.560]  article outlines presidential authority for the use of military arms and forces
[39:00.560 --> 39:07.680]  including unarmed drones in operations against domestic unrest this appears to
[39:07.680 --> 39:12.120]  be the latest step but doesn't appear it is she reporters want to be objective it
[39:12.120 --> 39:16.480]  be like if you know if Obama is eating a T-bone steak is eating a T-bone steak if
[39:16.480 --> 39:19.920]  if the federal government you know is picking their nose they're picking their
[39:19.920 --> 39:21.800]  nose I mean when they're doing this they're doing it let's go back to the
[39:21.800 --> 39:28.600]  article thank you this appears to be the latest step in administration decision
[39:28.600 --> 39:31.600]  to use force within the United States against the citizens so the defense
[39:31.600 --> 39:39.040]  official opposed the directive speaking to Bill Gertz and it goes in to say that
[39:39.040 --> 39:43.920]  they will use to quell civil disturbances drones under the emergency
[39:43.920 --> 39:48.240]  authority military forces armored vehicles the full weight and power of
[39:48.240 --> 39:53.960]  the Department of Defense folks this was going on under Clinton and continued
[39:53.960 --> 39:59.320]  under Bush but was more covert I mean I've made three films when Clinton was
[39:59.320 --> 40:04.760]  in office police state 2000 police state to the takeover police state three
[40:04.760 --> 40:08.880]  total enslavement once Bush was in but I made police state for the rise of FEMA
[40:08.880 --> 40:19.520]  in 2009 the rise of FEMA and you know you go see Godzilla and FEMA's the
[40:19.520 --> 40:24.120]  saviors saving the children but in the real world boys and girls FEMA's taking
[40:24.120 --> 40:27.520]  over all the land of this country and getting ready to force relocate people
[40:27.520 --> 40:33.040]  and will be over North com and the Department of Rural Affairs that is
[40:33.040 --> 40:38.560]  publicly a Pentagon operation now you go look up Obama's executive order it's the
[40:38.560 --> 40:44.680]  reorganize farming in this country under executive action and boots on the
[40:44.680 --> 40:49.680]  ground and is deploying plain clothes military into every small town in
[40:49.680 --> 40:56.120]  America and of course you remember the last year they quote passed a lawsuit
[40:56.120 --> 41:03.280]  we can now have the military involved domestically in psyops lying to you and
[41:03.280 --> 41:07.400]  then the first Psyop was to have earlier this year the undersecretary of defense
[41:07.400 --> 41:10.520]  he gave a press conference we wrote an article about it was the cover of the
[41:10.520 --> 41:14.840]  magazine he came out and said because of drug
[41:14.840 --> 41:19.120]  report we can no longer lie drug report and other new media we have to start
[41:19.120 --> 41:23.440]  telling the truth and the interest of telling the truth we're now going to
[41:23.440 --> 41:28.360]  come into your towns and cities and work with all new media and that means pay
[41:28.360 --> 41:33.600]  the money some cases small local blogs will get $200,000 or more to sell out
[41:33.600 --> 41:36.520]  you're gonna see a lot of that suddenly people gonna take their 30 pieces of
[41:36.520 --> 41:42.440]  silver and they're all gonna attack you know who now the big lesson in test is
[41:42.440 --> 41:47.680]  they'll attack info wars will attack woman they'll attack grudge and it's
[41:47.680 --> 41:51.600]  cash-hunting cognitive infiltration stuff and we've already seen it really
[41:51.600 --> 41:55.440]  heat up and most of them don't even hide the factor FBI operatives informants
[41:55.440 --> 41:58.960]  and others there's a headline government promises to stop lying because of drugs
[41:58.960 --> 42:03.640]  report shows the power of real media in breaking through the electronic Berlin
[42:03.640 --> 42:09.360]  wall but on Salazar Alex Jones wrote that article but then we go in later in
[42:09.360 --> 42:14.120]  the article admit though that overall you got like 400 plus shy off officers in
[42:14.120 --> 42:18.440]  the room civilian and military looking so depressed shaking their heads
[42:18.440 --> 42:26.160]  freaking out crying in the press conference asking questions like the
[42:26.160 --> 42:29.680]  woman goes I'm tired of lying no one likes me and everybody's shaking their
[42:29.680 --> 42:34.600]  head going honey you don't get it we're announcing we're not gonna lie because
[42:34.600 --> 42:42.640]  we're getting ready to really lie the psyops on them that's why you got to
[42:42.640 --> 42:45.440]  watch the hour-long press conference people are shaking their heads they're
[42:45.440 --> 42:49.440]  freaking out throwing their pencils down I mean this is such trees and you're
[42:49.440 --> 42:53.680]  seeing but they're saying we come in peace oh we're gonna go out now and not
[42:53.680 --> 42:57.320]  lie anymore we're just gonna operate domestically well the room full of
[42:57.320 --> 43:01.240]  people at the Pentagon knows they've been operating domestically up one side
[43:01.240 --> 43:09.640]  and down the other I was on 590 FM one morning for like two hours as a guest
[43:09.640 --> 43:15.840]  and as I was walking out I saw this fellow walk in to promote an anti gun
[43:15.840 --> 43:20.400]  agenda and I noticed how he was talking in the coffee room on a cell phone is
[43:20.400 --> 43:25.200]  bearing and I looked at him and I said you're not just with a Bloomberg group I
[43:25.200 --> 43:30.320]  said you're an army officer aren't you I just tell us a special forces guy and
[43:30.320 --> 43:36.840]  he looked evil and he goes Alex Jones he's had this arrogant you know they
[43:36.840 --> 43:39.600]  feel so good because they're with the system he's laughed at me in the coffee
[43:39.600 --> 43:46.560]  room and he goes yeah I'm with the military and I go you're running a
[43:46.560 --> 43:49.800]  Psyop and I guess he didn't think I was recording was I wasn't he just
[43:49.800 --> 43:53.840]  arrogantly went yeah we are you can't stop us and shove past me I went in the
[43:53.840 --> 44:00.080]  radio room before they went live I said this guy admits he's a Psyop and I got
[44:00.080 --> 44:03.520]  to be honest I was starting to blow up a little bit I mean I was really what he
[44:03.520 --> 44:07.320]  was doing was illegal at that time I don't care if they passed some law
[44:07.320 --> 44:14.160]  standards legal it's illegal but man here was us army engaged in a Psyop
[44:14.160 --> 44:23.080]  against my guns I mean I just who I mean I just really got in my crop I
[44:23.080 --> 44:27.960]  I'm getting angry right now getting shells just remembering that mmm because
[44:27.960 --> 44:30.760]  now they're operating all over the place and folks they're coming after
[44:30.760 --> 44:34.360]  everything and here's the deal most military people are great folks that's
[44:34.360 --> 44:37.960]  why the military is waking up across the board over 80% that I talked to her
[44:37.960 --> 44:41.440]  fully awake now because of this attempt to take over the system doesn't care
[44:41.440 --> 44:45.680]  they'll take the 10 15% 20% that will go along with it they're gonna promote
[44:45.680 --> 44:51.200]  them and these people see us as the enemy and they're coming they're coming
[44:51.200 --> 44:55.400]  and here's the Washington Times with the document that says they are prepared
[44:55.400 --> 45:00.760]  with the drones and everything else for war with us but then what Bill Gertz
[45:00.760 --> 45:04.800]  won't do is he's such a journalist is it's already so alarmist they water down
[45:04.800 --> 45:09.600]  the article and I get why they do that that's what they do I do the opposite
[45:11.280 --> 45:14.920]  they go on
[45:14.920 --> 45:20.840]  and you know basically break down the whole attack plan against us in the
[45:20.840 --> 45:24.920]  article what we do is we take this and then show all the old articles where
[45:24.920 --> 45:28.080]  it's for the Tea Party gun owners everybody and point out hey by the way
[45:28.080 --> 45:32.880]  it isn't just for domestic dissent against the general American people it's
[45:32.880 --> 45:37.680]  specifically against folks that follow the Constitution Bill writes we're the
[45:37.680 --> 45:41.600]  enemy because this is a foreign illegal occupation like the Vici French under
[45:41.600 --> 45:47.360]  Hitler this is real this is real and the Pentagon is speaking out the good
[45:47.360 --> 45:50.960]  there are good people in there guaranteed knowing they're being spied on
[45:50.960 --> 45:55.960]  and are warning Bill Gertz about it so if you're in the military if you're in
[45:55.960 --> 46:00.000]  the FBI the Secret Service if you're in the system I don't care what it is you
[46:00.000 --> 46:04.080]  better stand up for America right now and speak out publicly or internally
[46:04.080 --> 46:07.920]  about this because there's a civil war going on right now by the globalist
[46:07.920 --> 46:12.440]  politically to take this country over we've got to expose this is going on
[46:12.440 --> 46:16.120]  we've got to expose the globalist that they are meeting in secret illegally in
[46:16.120 --> 46:20.160]  Copenhagen we got to admit the conspiracy theorists were right we've
[46:20.160 --> 46:24.200]  all got admit we're in trouble and then even though it's incredible it's
[46:24.200 --> 46:27.600]  happening history is incredible truth is stranger in fiction and this is
[46:27.600 --> 46:31.480]  happening now and this is an epic time to be alive and it's an honor to be alive
[46:31.480 --> 46:35.440]  right now being able to speak out against this and expose it now David
[46:35.440 --> 46:38.620]  Knight joins us been there for over a day now in Copenhagen Denmark covering
[46:38.620 --> 46:42.320]  Bilderberg a lot has happened and he's there to break it down with us a little
[46:42.320 --> 46:46.240]  bit of the next hour then Paul Watson's gonna join us and we're gonna have open
[46:46.240 --> 46:50.080]  phones the entire second half of the transmission I know you guys are also
[46:50.080 --> 46:55.480]  getting a lot of national international TV coverage of what you're doing so very
[46:55.480 --> 47:00.000]  effective only 24 hours into coverage great job David Knight give us your
[47:00.000 --> 47:08.000]  report well Alex I'm here kind of in a newspaper you gotta love it there goes
[47:08.000 --> 47:11.080]  this guy I mean we see what's going on here Bilderberg I'm not aware of what's
[47:11.080 --> 47:14.040]  going on listening to you talking about this bill Gertz report did it just go
[47:14.040 --> 47:16.800]  out can you see me now no you're good now go ahead it's just a little there's a
[47:16.800 --> 47:22.680]  delay I was just saying I'm not not able to get on the internet here we have
[47:22.680 --> 47:25.960]  so little connection here so I was just listening what you're saying about Bill
[47:25.960 --> 47:30.040]  Gertz and you know people need to understand that we're coming to a real
[47:30.040 --> 47:33.240]  crossroads they've been talking about all this stuff coming down and the
[47:33.240 --> 47:39.520]  time frame of 20 to 2020 to 2025 and they're laying the legal framework for
[47:39.520 --> 47:43.280]  this they believe as well as as we pointed out over and over again they're
[47:43.280 --> 47:47.520]  training for it really hard and preparing for it and buying the ammunition so
[47:47.520 --> 47:52.080]  you know it's just like that book the fourth turning by Strauss and how they
[47:52.080 --> 47:55.920]  point out that although history doesn't repeat itself it certainly does rhyme and
[47:55.920 --> 48:00.240]  there's a rhythm to that rhyme and and we see that this is building up here at
[48:00.240 --> 48:03.560]  Bilderberg the topics that they're going to be talking about are going to
[48:03.560 --> 48:08.520]  include the Trans-Pacific Partnership the same thing for the Transatlantic
[48:08.520 --> 48:13.160]  Partnership they're going to start putting together the pieces of trade
[48:13.160 --> 48:17.320]  agreements that the Trilateral Commission has essentially been talking
[48:17.320 --> 48:21.880]  about doing since 1973 they came with the Trilateral Commission what they did
[48:21.880 --> 48:27.480]  was a joined Europe, North America and Asia and now we see the elements we see
[48:27.480 --> 48:31.600]  the actual elements that they were planning with Bilderberg but to get you
[48:31.600 --> 48:35.920]  up to date on what's happening here if you turn around here Josh you can see
[48:35.920 --> 48:40.640]  they've expanded the the barriers the barricades quite a bit since we were
[48:40.640 --> 48:44.000]  here last night. I heard Josh got assaulted and then we have video that's
[48:44.000 --> 48:48.000]  about to be uploaded to that we can show that in a moment. For the most part the
[48:48.000 --> 48:53.240]  police have been extremely cordial even lifting up lines for us and and you know
[48:53.240 --> 48:56.440]  they'll be very nice but boy if you cross them they will come down and you just
[48:56.440 --> 49:01.320]  like any cops now Josh was just preparing to come to this shoot and he
[49:01.320 --> 49:06.440]  had the camera in his hand and somebody called the police in our hotel he was
[49:06.440 --> 49:09.960]  walking out of our hotel with the camera in his hand they called the police
[49:09.960 --> 49:15.160]  and Karen was filming somewhere else and she saw the police running and she
[49:15.160 --> 49:18.440]  didn't know they were coming for Josh and she saw them courting Josh I should
[49:18.440 --> 49:22.320]  let you talk to Josh and let him tell you what happened. Josh why don't you tell
[49:22.320 --> 49:26.600]  them what happened in your own words here because I was filming people arriving.
[49:26.600 --> 49:33.080]  Yeah so I was leaving the hotel and I had my camera which I've had all day long
[49:33.080 --> 49:38.640]  and the cops run up to me and say they need my ID they need me to prove that
[49:38.640 --> 49:45.600]  I'm staying in the hotel because someone called the police on me because I'm not
[49:45.600 --> 49:50.880]  really sure why I guess because now cameras are scary. They're only allowed
[49:50.880 --> 49:54.360]  to spy on us and take all our liberties but we can't be journalists in a major
[49:54.360 --> 49:59.480]  capital city please continue though with what they did to you because we just
[49:59.480 --> 50:04.280]  showed some video of them roughing somebody else up. Yeah the videos are
[50:04.280 --> 50:08.400]  gonna be up soon but they stopped me not far from here I was coming to do this
[50:08.400 --> 50:14.600]  broadcast and they detained me they wouldn't let me leave and I asked them
[50:14.600 --> 50:19.560]  didn't they think it was more important to maybe cover what these guys are doing
[50:19.560 --> 50:24.320]  in this building than to detain someone who's simply walking with a camera which
[50:24.320 --> 50:28.600]  I've been doing all day and haven't done anything wrong and they couldn't answer
[50:28.600 --> 50:32.720]  obviously and just earlier separately there was a guy right behind where we
[50:32.720 --> 50:36.280]  are now this video is coming up too who was being patted down groped and
[50:36.280 --> 50:41.080]  harassed by police because he was standing looking at the building and
[50:41.080 --> 50:46.200]  looking at all of these the blockades everything blocked out. Wow what a free
[50:46.200 --> 50:51.760]  country what a free society where you look in a capital city at a major hotel
[50:51.760 --> 50:56.240]  with barriers being put up you don't do that slave this is North Korea I mean
[50:56.240 --> 51:01.920]  Copenhagen Denmark how dare you we'll be right back. Harvest Right is the world's
[51:01.920 --> 51:06.440]  first in-home freeze-dryer freeze dry your own fruits vegetables meats and

[53:57.800 --> 54:24.460]  health products imagine world leaders meeting in secret in the middle of a
[54:24.460 --> 54:28.860]  major city and reporters want to cover it and walk out of their own hotel with a
[54:28.860 --> 54:35.420]  camera why rough somebody up call the police immediately oh my gosh and people
[54:35.420 --> 54:39.540]  want to stand across the street and stare at the world leaders arriving let's
[54:39.540 --> 54:43.780]  arrest them let's beat them up and this is the same thing if it's in the US if
[54:43.780 --> 54:49.380]  it's in England if it's in Spain if it's in Greece this goes on but then
[54:49.380 --> 54:54.180]  there's always a public backlash and the police back off I gotta say the police
[54:54.180 --> 54:58.220]  did not act like this any in England last year I'd seen it in videos for more
[54:58.220 --> 55:02.100]  than a decade ago so it's important to go out and cover this to show they're
[55:02.100 --> 55:09.420]  acting like this to keep societies free but really out of control to see this
[55:09.420 --> 55:14.140]  type of behavior going on meanwhile the globalists are working as hard as they
[55:14.140 --> 55:17.220]  can destroy those police officers lives but they don't care they've been chosen
[55:17.220 --> 55:22.220]  because they will attack the people Josh finishing up the point you were
[55:22.220 --> 55:28.380]  making right so this actually just happened I mean that's we're kind of a
[55:28.380 --> 55:32.260]  little bit we were scrambling to make sure that we got on because they were
[55:32.260 --> 55:37.580]  they were detaining me and not letting me leave and right before that I just
[55:37.580 --> 55:42.140]  said there was a guy right behind us here he was standing there looking at the
[55:42.140 --> 55:47.420]  barricades and the cops came up made him take his shoes off patted him down
[55:47.420 --> 55:51.420]  because apparently he was a threat for looking at these barricades I don't want
[55:51.420 --> 55:54.780]  to be clear that's in the year in the free speech zone right now it looks like
[55:54.780 --> 55:59.220]  or off the side of the hotel so if you're just there on a city street you're
[55:59.220 --> 56:04.740]  evil yeah yeah yeah exactly and then before that another video that's being
[56:04.740 --> 56:09.540]  uploaded right now right behind David it right in front of the hotel there was a
[56:09.540 --> 56:15.300]  guy filming cops came up told him to give him give them his ID and to turn
[56:15.300 --> 56:19.820]  around and leave and he refused to do it so they grabbed him and they roughed
[56:19.820 --> 56:25.100]  him up they drug him across the street across traffic and took him behind a
[56:25.100 --> 56:32.140]  screen where the elite are going into their hotel rooms it took him behind a
[56:32.140 --> 56:38.540]  screen and it looked like they were beating him really yeah well I tell
[56:38.540 --> 56:42.020]  Josh is that's a bunch of security over there at that picnic table isn't it
[56:42.020 --> 56:45.780]  maybe after the break comes we should go over and try to interview him in North
[56:45.780 --> 56:52.020]  Korea formerly Denmark now under Nazi control or Soviet style oppressive
[56:52.020 --> 56:55.940]  control authoritarian control I mean I mean if you guys want you want to go
[56:55.940 --> 57:01.580]  talk to the gods or maybe maybe they'll beat you have what do you want to do yeah
[57:01.580 --> 57:04.860]  sure let's do it we're actually surrounded by police right now police
[57:04.860 --> 57:10.380]  are outnumbering people here so I feel safe you feel safe well don't worry
[57:10.380 --> 57:14.940]  maybe they just brought that person behind the screen so Henry Kissinger
[57:14.940 --> 57:20.940]  to do a proctology exam more than likely I hope so well you know that's what the
[57:20.940 --> 57:24.900]  TSA is for is to condition us to be slaves to treat us that we have no
[57:24.900 --> 57:29.860]  rights so that we have no dignity it's it's prisoner induction training so what
[57:29.860 --> 57:34.780]  did the police are they local Copenhagen police what do they say to you while
[57:34.780 --> 57:40.860]  they were talking to you well I asked if I could leave they said no they said that
[57:40.860 --> 57:45.940]  they needed my ID and my room key and I refuse to give it to them and they said
[57:45.940 --> 57:49.100]  they were not gonna let me go unless I gave it to them so just for time's sake
[57:49.100 --> 57:51.820]  because we were rushing over here to get on the air I said fine I'll give you it
[57:51.820 --> 57:57.060]  but I need to leave so I gave them my ID I gave them my room key which didn't
[57:57.060 --> 57:59.700]  have my number on it by the way we're showing the footage of them beating the

[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:45.540]  they're being nice and then suddenly they start grabbing on our reporters going
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:50.660]  after them trying to take their cameras and we catch on tape them dragging a
[01:00:50.660 --> 01:00:55.340]  reporter with a camera behind a screen you can clearly see him punching and
[01:00:55.340 --> 01:01:02.220]  stomping him full power I mean they are stomping the daylights out of him and
[01:01:02.220 --> 01:01:07.700]  then another reporter is getting footage of it so the police try to chase him
[01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:13.460]  down to take him to the torture dungeon I mean this is literally I don't know the
[01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:20.260]  headline that's strong enough like police take journalist to secluded pins to
[01:01:20.260 --> 01:01:28.900]  be beaten I mean this is just this isn't a major human rights scandal that they
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:34.180]  got free speech pins blocked out windows blacked out fences so people can't
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:39.500]  see through them and but there is a good 8-inch gap and you can clearly see they
[01:01:39.500 --> 01:01:42.860]  thrown him on the ground and they're stomping on him and they take him there
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:49.300]  to torturing and folks if they get away with this precedent it's over see what
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:53.540]  secrecy is for so they can commit their crimes in the dark look at him stomping
[01:01:53.540 --> 01:01:59.020]  him a full power stomping full power hitting and then chasing a reporter if

[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:12.420]  cameraman I mean I tell you you've only been here six months or so you've
[01:02:12.420 --> 01:02:17.340]  already seen a lot my friend the NSA you saw you saw the fed stand down with
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:20.140]  their guns pointed out you threatened to shoot you at the Bundy ranch you were
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:26.380]  there and now this and you you're on the front lines my friend. Yeah well the
[01:02:26.380 --> 01:02:29.580]  difference here is that well the difference that I've noticed with the
[01:02:29.580 --> 01:02:33.900]  police specifically is that there's almost you almost get a feeling of
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:38.900]  there they're just cowards I mean I'm kind of surprised that they were
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:45.460]  beating the guy in front of the hotel because they they seem like wimps I
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:50.700]  mean that's just who do you think wants to beat people. Well that's true yeah the
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:54.220]  small guy in high school who gets picked on goes on to be a cop who beats people
[01:02:54.220 --> 01:03:00.820]  up for fun. Well all I know is in bad police departments they it's either
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.940]  like locked out of the other way around I mean somebody who's tough just doesn't
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:08.060]  aren't beating people up for no reason let's let's continue to talk about I
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:11.140]  mean what did you think when you're watching them clearly it looks
[01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:15.300]  unmistakable they're stomping him and hitting him so I guess you know they
[01:03:15.300 --> 01:03:21.740]  that keyhole didn't get closed there Josh. Yeah well it it was it was shocking
[01:03:21.740 --> 01:03:24.980]  but you can see in the video there's another reporter who runs across the
[01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:28.940]  street to film it and they run after him and chase him and chase him across the
[01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:32.380]  street so he isn't filming them do it but I guess they didn't notice us standing
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:35.980]  right beside them beating him. Well see he went around the corner to shoot around
[01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.820]  the fence you got to get with that reporter that citizen journalist and
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:44.340]  get his footage I guarantee you they're gonna try to deny they were attacking
[01:03:44.340 --> 01:03:48.980]  him and I guarantee you he they've got the video he's got the goods where is
[01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:55.740]  that guy we to interview him right now you see that guy in the black jacket. No

[01:14:59.220 --> 01:15:03.940]  Denmark with David Knight and Josh Owens recap what's happened and you're
[01:15:03.940 --> 01:15:09.260]  about to go up and talk to the police David Knight okay so Alex what we did
[01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:13.020]  was we came over here we found the guy who ran across the street and shot the
[01:15:13.020 --> 01:15:17.780]  video and he said that he can't see what he's got on his camera at this point he
[01:15:17.780 --> 01:15:21.620]  said the monitor is too low he has to take it back to his computer to take a
[01:15:21.620 --> 01:15:25.100]  look at it so there's no way that we could actually shoot it he wasn't sure
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:30.060]  what he what he got at all so we don't have anything to show you on that but
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:33.740]  we were standing here we just had somebody get run over down here at the
[01:15:33.740 --> 01:15:38.300]  intersection here but what they told us the lady that was there said the reason
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:43.060]  that they they did this was because she said the guy was psychotic he was in
[01:15:43.060 --> 01:15:47.380]  Watson's face yelling at him and Watson wasn't doing anything he was just
[01:15:47.380 --> 01:15:51.740]  standing there and the police came over told him to stop several times he didn't
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:54.620]  stop at that point they arrested him he started resisting and then they got
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:15:58.180]  really tough well that's the way to put my foot in my mouth the police may have
[01:15:58.180 --> 01:16:02.220]  taken him to a death camp now let me seriously that's him dragging a reporter
[01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:05.940]  often well chasing the other reporter away that was wrong and then now we
[01:16:05.940 --> 01:16:09.020]  learned it was the guy going after Watson is that the same guy that keeps
[01:16:09.020 --> 01:16:14.500]  going after Watson oh I don't know he was he was on something when I went by he
[01:16:14.500 --> 01:16:17.820]  recognized me and he said something about why don't you report on the fact
[01:16:17.820 --> 01:16:21.780]  that DNA doesn't exist and dinosaurs don't exist and that sort of thing so okay
[01:16:21.780 --> 01:16:24.820]  okay well I mean that's what we said earlier the police have been pretty nice
[01:16:24.820 --> 01:16:27.860]  we're trying to be fair reporters here I just see someone being drug away and
[01:16:27.860 --> 01:16:31.620]  beaten behind a screen I still think it's wrong to beating behind the screen
[01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.980]  I mean if they're gonna have to restraining they should do it in front
[01:16:33.980 --> 01:16:37.620]  everybody and then why are they chasing the other reporter that's filming it
[01:16:37.620 --> 01:16:43.820]  yeah I know exactly and what they did was after that now now Josh was down here
[01:16:43.820 --> 01:16:47.500]  shooting front on I was on the side of the hotel getting a side view of the
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:51.500]  people that were coming out of the limousines and so they took him down
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:54.380]  there where I was and at that point they got him on the ground they started
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:56.660]  doing the typical cop thing where they put the knee in the back and he's
[01:16:56.660 --> 01:16:59.620]  screaming they're deliberately hurting me and he's screaming bloody murder and
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:04.700]  there was a cop started standing around him and one police woman motioned to
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:07.260]  another police woman with her little finger like get over this way because
[01:17:07.260 --> 01:17:10.740]  she saw me filming she looked at me saw me filming motion to her to get the way
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:14.460]  to try to get around so they were trying to cover up what they were doing over
[01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:19.260]  there even to so it's clearly taken behind they clearly take them on the
[01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:24.140]  screen and beat the hell out of it yeah I haven't seen the front on view that
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:28.460]  that Josh got so I just saw when they they took him over to the side I filmed
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:31.900]  some of that he hasn't seen my footage yet either but I'm sure that the footage
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:35.660]  that they got front on sounds a lot more sensational than that point at that
[01:17:35.660 --> 01:17:41.180]  point they had pretty much they'd gotten quite a few licks in on him well I'll
[01:17:41.180 --> 01:17:44.740]  give the police this they have better posture than US police they all walk
[01:17:44.740 --> 01:17:48.940]  around like they got a broomstick up their back yeah there hasn't been that
[01:17:48.940 --> 01:17:54.180]  kind of bullying that you typically expect from American police and when
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:58.420]  this guy was fighting and and you know banging around you know they didn't
[01:17:58.420 --> 01:18:03.620]  kill him which which I remarked to Karen I said you know that guy probably would
[01:18:03.620 --> 01:18:08.500]  have been killed in America certainly into Mexico I think so well in Mexico if
[01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:11.700]  you say I'm a law student I have rights they literally rip your testicles off
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:15.260]  yeah that's what they did exactly I mean I'm sorry to use that graphic language
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:18.260]  that's what they did I mean yeah yeah they kicked the guy so hard that he
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:22.340]  lost the technical testicle we were just walking down here to see the accident
[01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:26.140]  and and talk to this guy and we saw they've got a don't tread on me sign here
[01:18:26.140 --> 01:18:29.300]  we just we hadn't seen this yet and there's an info war sign right down here
[01:18:29.300 --> 01:18:34.580]  so a lot of people have recognized us they were all wondering where you were
[01:18:34.580 --> 01:18:38.380]  the very disappointed that you weren't here this year to bullhorn the
[01:18:38.380 --> 01:18:43.300]  Bilderberg attendees but we've got quite a few shots of people arriving and you
[01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:47.780]  know it's kind of like we're paparazzi it's it's kind of on one level I felt
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:51.460]  silly doing it but you know we have to show people no no but see there's
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:56.420]  actually paparazzi for secret world leaders so that we're aware of who's
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:19:00.100]  running our life instead Edward Burnett said we're gonna make Hollywood people
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:04.540]  popular in the 20s instead of people being obsessed with world leaders because
[01:19:04.540 --> 01:19:07.940]  people used to want to know who ran the world because people were politically
[01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:12.820]  involved now we're obsessed about Kim Kardashian who is that in the van that
[01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:16.260]  looks like a bunch of security people in the van oh yeah through the fence
[01:19:16.260 --> 01:19:20.180]  there no no through the fence oh through the fence yes right here yep that's a
[01:19:20.180 --> 01:19:23.100]  bunch of security people yeah let's walk down towards you and see what's

[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:45.300]  going back to Copenhagen Denmark where regardless if the guy has some unorthodox
[01:24:45.300 --> 01:24:50.580]  views the police grabbed him clearly beat him up behind a fence go after another
[01:24:50.580 --> 01:24:55.860]  reporter covering it that is a big no-no and meanwhile Watson's about to get
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:25:00.420]  done with Danish and RT interviews and being mobbed by the media and groupies
[01:25:00.420 --> 01:25:07.500]  and then we will get a report from him I'm told your wife got really good
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:11.500]  photos of Robert Rubin general Petraeus we'll get those up on info wars.com and
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:15.020]  tweet him at real Alex Jones other points you'd like to make David Knight
[01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:19.740]  before we come back and go to Watson and then segue into other news and phone
[01:25:19.740 --> 01:25:24.260]  calls today well Alex the reason that Watson is so busy doing interviews is
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:28.100]  because we're basically the only press that's here the only other people that
[01:25:28.100 --> 01:25:32.140]  are here are Charlie Skelton is and his wife and other than that there's not
[01:25:32.140 --> 01:25:35.740]  really any alternative media other than just independent bloggers that are here
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:39.980]  and they're confined into the free speech zone as they as they put it but
[01:25:39.980 --> 01:25:43.740]  Charlie Skelton's wife was telling me that the photographer that they usually
[01:25:43.740 --> 01:25:49.340]  have didn't come to this event because he wanted to go to the Bilderberg Hotel
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:54.420]  itself where they had the very first meeting 60 years ago and he said that
[01:25:54.420 --> 01:25:58.020]  he took some pictures of the people that showed up there he said there were three
[01:25:58.020 --> 01:26:01.780]  or four old-timers that were there so they're actually going back reminiscing
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:06.020]  about when they first started plotting to take over the world so the London Guardian
[01:26:06.020 --> 01:26:11.580]  folks had a gut reaction a gut feeling to go to the original Bilderberg Hotel
[01:26:11.580 --> 01:26:17.260]  from 54 in Oosterbeck Holland and lo and behold some of the old globalists were
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:21.980]  actually there that's right that's right few of them showed up I'm not sure who
[01:26:21.980 --> 01:26:25.740]  yet she hasn't found out yet so we're gonna talk to her later she's very busy
[01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:31.620]  right now is as we have been after about 4 p.m. our time it got very busy there
[01:26:31.620 --> 01:26:34.540]  were quite a few people coming at that point in time we we got here early this
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:38.620]  morning we've been standing out here all day taking pictures of the people that
[01:26:38.620 --> 01:26:42.580]  come up but in the afternoon about four o'clock is when it really started
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:47.900]  coming pretty frequently so she's pretty busy they're still coming in all right
[01:26:47.900 --> 01:26:50.660]  well we'll get those photos up this evening on the nightly news we'll have
[01:26:50.660 --> 01:26:56.220]  boil downs of all of this as soon as Watson's done with with the interviews
[01:26:56.220 --> 01:26:58.860]  I know he's been busy the last hour I told him that's fine go ahead and do
[01:26:58.860 --> 01:27:02.420]  those interviews to get the word out we'll get an update in his take on the
[01:27:02.420 --> 01:27:06.660]  day's activities and I'll go to other news and phone calls but there's a lot
[01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:11.500]  of good news here Bill Gertz got the internal document from an insider at the
[01:27:11.500 --> 01:27:16.380]  Pentagon it was concerned and they're reporting on the open plan to use armored
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:24.060]  vehicles tanks drones it to crush domestic protesting in fact it says civil
[01:27:24.060 --> 01:27:28.620]  unrest so and it says the Pentagon's very upset about this again most people in
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:32.100]  the government are aren't bad it's that the people that run our government are
[01:27:32.100 --> 01:27:36.900]  bad I mean it's almost more people in the Pentagon and the military I would say
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:40.500]  that are more awake and more patriotic than the general public I mean
[01:27:40.500 --> 01:27:45.980]  undoubtedly so it's like the military is our hope and our fear it's just like
[01:27:45.980 --> 01:27:51.020]  America could help save the world or help destroy it I mean that's it's always
[01:27:51.020 --> 01:27:56.640]  like that historically it's we are the fulcrum to a great extent undoubtedly the
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:00.860]  West is and the West is not leading the world into good stuff now we're leading
[01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:05.580]  it into bad David not your take on that yeah Alex we really are standing on a
[01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:09.180]  knife edge and like you said it could go either way they're they're laying the
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:13.260]  foundation for this we're trying to wake people up we go to the military bases
[01:28:13.260 --> 01:28:17.380]  we walk through the fake villages that they're planning on taking and yet people
[01:28:17.380 --> 01:28:20.700]  are still not waking up so hopefully with the documents that that have been
[01:28:20.700 --> 01:28:24.100]  released today with the documents that we've shown where they're buying massive
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:28.620]  amounts of ammunition with the equipment that they're putting out and giving to
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:32.020]  the police departments and the way that they're training them essentially to
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:35.140]  shoot first you know that's a big part of the problem in New Mexico they've got
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:39.340]  a shoot first curriculum there that they're training the police on and one
[01:28:39.340 --> 01:28:44.500]  of the police trainers there at the Academy actually refused to teach that
[01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:49.060]  curriculum and they fired him because he would not do it so there are police who
[01:28:49.060 --> 01:28:52.780]  are concerned about the way that they're changing the rules of engagement the way
[01:28:52.780 --> 01:28:56.300]  that they're approaching and and regarding the public and the same thing is
[01:28:56.300 --> 01:28:59.100]  happening in the military and we're seeing a convergence of those two things
[01:28:59.100 --> 01:29:02.620]  when I was looking at the asymmetric warfare videos one of the things that
[01:29:02.620 --> 01:29:07.380]  the guy said was one of the mistakes that we made this was a marine colonel he
[01:29:07.380 --> 01:29:10.940]  said one of the mistakes that we made when he came in we should have combined
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:15.460]  the military with the police that's what he said that's what they're doing now
[01:29:15.460 --> 01:29:19.900]  so it's hopefully this Gertz thing will wake wake people up and in those Marine
[01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:25.060]  Corps training videos with former generals colonels they're admitting it's
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:30.940]  for domestic operations and how to occupy America for a permanent government a
[01:29:30.940 --> 01:29:34.900]  permanent police state this is totally criminal totally illegitimate just like
[01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:38.300]  somebody robbing a bank or coming to your house at gunpoint saying cook me
[01:29:38.300 --> 01:29:42.140]  dinner I mean I mean this is this is total turning Dave I'm gonna come back

[01:33:10.700 --> 01:33:15.220]  from time to time we've been tempted to believe that society has become too
[01:33:15.220 --> 01:33:21.060]  complex to be managed by self-rule that government by an elite group is
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:29.780]  superior to government for by and of the people. The Alex Jones show because
[01:33:29.780 --> 01:33:37.740]  there is a war on for your mind. Hello me meet the real me and my misfits
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:46.940]  wave life a dark black past is my most valued possession ain't sight is always
[01:33:46.940 --> 01:33:53.660]  2020 looking back it's still a bit fuzzy speak of mutually assured destruction
[01:33:53.660 --> 01:34:01.660]  nice to worry yeah I was paranoid I said there was a group called the
[01:34:01.660 --> 01:34:06.620]  Builderburg group 18 19 years ago and the media said it didn't exist even six
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:13.420]  years ago New York Times does not exist and after all they wouldn't lie to you
[01:34:13.420 --> 01:34:17.500]  I mean you didn't build your business either and Saddam had nuclear power
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:22.180]  plants enriching uranium under rose bushes in his backyard and he ran 9-11
[01:34:22.180 --> 01:34:28.700]  to not Saudi Arabia and the globalist by the way Curt Nimmo wrote a story
[01:34:28.700 --> 01:34:33.220]  yesterday about this and it curve is going to bring that back into me this
[01:34:33.220 --> 01:34:36.180]  morning I'd ask for you get that from him because I want to actually give the
[01:34:36.180 --> 01:34:42.220]  headline out of his article thanks and it there was the headline we need to fund
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:48.420]  rebels in Syria to fight al-Qaeda and I saw that article there it is US will
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:52.860]  train rebels to counter CIA's al-Qaeda terrorists in Syria and I saw his
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:58.420]  article read where they said it and then last night I turned the television on
[01:34:58.420 --> 01:35:03.940]  about 10 minutes to check the news and I was watching CNN and with a straight
[01:35:03.940 --> 01:35:10.060]  face they were saying yeah there's a big al-Qaeda threat and we've got to do
[01:35:10.060 --> 01:35:14.620]  something about it and that's why we need to invade Syria and then this
[01:35:14.620 --> 01:35:18.780]  morning they had Fox News on in the control room and I saw it on the
[01:35:18.780 --> 01:35:23.620]  scroll so I turned it up so I know if you're watching the news you're seeing
[01:35:23.620 --> 01:35:28.900]  it and that's the new branding shucks we got to go into Syria al-Qaeda we got to
[01:35:28.900 --> 01:35:33.060]  train these other rebels cuz al-Qaeda and Assad they just kind of throw it in
[01:35:33.060 --> 01:35:36.860]  like al-Qaeda and Assad you know they're not saying Assad's with al-Qaeda that's
[01:35:36.860 --> 01:35:40.820]  too obvious it's just yeah there's al-Qaeda and Assad not we've been funding
[01:35:40.820 --> 01:35:45.100]  for three plus years al-Qaeda to attack Assad and there was a big thing you know
[01:35:45.100 --> 01:35:48.820]  just six months ago where Rand Paul and Ted Cruz said no we're not al-Qaeda's
[01:35:48.820 --> 01:35:52.460]  air force and info wars comm led the charge and drugs report covered it and
[01:35:52.460 --> 01:35:56.140]  we pointed out that the rebels launched the chemical attacks and world net
[01:35:56.140 --> 01:36:00.300]  daily covered it and it they got caught Turkey got caught what launching false
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:08.700]  likes so six months later they think you're stupid and now we need to have
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:12.620]  more boots on the ground and troops to fight al-Qaeda which is sixty plus
[01:36:12.620 --> 01:36:18.860]  percent of the force I mean that's how dumb they think you are ladies and
[01:36:18.860 --> 01:36:29.140]  gentlemen this is this is reach biblical level crazy town dimensions David
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:32.220]  night I'm gonna shift gears into phone calls and a bunch of news I haven't
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:35.180]  covered yet but I know there's a lot of other points you haven't gotten to yet
[01:36:35.180 --> 01:36:39.340]  other observations from Bilderberg 2014 I want to hear those from you briefly and
[01:36:39.340 --> 01:36:43.820]  so you can get back to getting photos and video up info wars comm the next
[01:36:43.820 --> 01:36:46.620]  few minutes we're gonna have the video for radio listeners that didn't see it
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:51.140]  earlier at info wars comm of the police dragging a demonstrator away to beat
[01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:53.780]  him up behind a screen and then trying to grab reporters that were getting
[01:36:53.780 --> 01:37:00.020]  footage of it but for me you're there to show there's men behind the curtain and
[01:37:00.020 --> 01:37:05.420]  to be paparazzi of the real controllers they they want to be in secret they want
[01:37:05.420 --> 01:37:09.900]  us going after fake celebrities and not being informed your take on that well
[01:37:09.900 --> 01:37:13.620]  that's absolutely true Alex I mean you know on the one level we're just taking
[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:16.500]  pictures of these celebrities and we're trying to match them up to card so we've
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:20.220]  got to see which ones they are but it's very important that people see that this
[01:37:20.220 --> 01:37:24.740]  is actually happening that's why we're doing it it this really has consequences
[01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:27.900]  and you know during the break we were just before we went to the break we were
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:31.780]  talking about the military and how they're using the military training the
[01:37:31.780 --> 01:37:38.180]  military to to come after the American people we had a Danish Marine come over
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:42.900]  to us he's got a 9-11 was an inside job shirt on and he said he joined the Royal
[01:37:42.900 --> 01:37:45.900]  Marines because he wanted to make the world a better place he said his very
[01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:51.220]  first lesson was how to poison the water and the food supply and then they told
[01:37:51.220 --> 01:37:55.260]  him less people is more peace you know things like that so he said he got out
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.260]  of that he joined the social workers then he realized that they weren't
[01:37:58.260 --> 01:38:01.900]  resuscitating people if they were of a certain age because it was too expensive
[01:38:01.900 --> 01:38:06.860]  so he's seen this he's had it this is what's happening with a lot of veterans
[01:38:06.860 --> 01:38:10.780]  a lot of people who were very ideas idealistically went into the military and
[01:38:10.780 --> 01:38:15.300]  now hopefully they're seeing that our own government is training against our
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:19.180]  own people how many different times and how many different ways they have to see
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:23.940]  that from the training scenarios to the weapons acquisitions to the training
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:27.900]  sites that they have this is and now this newest released video hopefully
[01:38:27.900 --> 01:38:34.180]  this will wake people up I don't know what David David how did we in the 40
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:40.940]  50 60 70s 80s have a lot lower taxes on the general public and not kill old
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:45.820]  people how did we raise our taxes build the bureaucracy and now there's no
[01:38:45.820 --> 01:38:49.860]  money for old people but we had to have socialist health care because we love
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:54.300]  the old people but now here's the death panels the truth is this is about
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:58.940]  lowering our standard of living by the so-called left who are a bunch of
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:02.980]  fascist and it's taking away people's choices you know we look at Bilderberg
[01:39:02.980 --> 01:39:07.020]  here and the guy that I talked to last night that as he was running us out I
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:09.540]  said you know they're gonna be making decisions about how to run your life and
[01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:14.180]  he goes well very good I hope they make good decisions and laugh at us right he
[01:39:14.180 --> 01:39:17.460]  does he's not ever going to have a say about how his life is run and it's that
[01:39:17.460 --> 01:39:22.660]  way from the large overreaching policies down to how he spends his money as
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:26.420]  these guys from Denmark were talking to us they said they went through and they
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:29.060]  worked up with all the different taxes somebody making a hundred thousand
[01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:33.060]  dollars gets to keep four thousand dollars of it the rest of it the
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:37.100]  government takes for their taxes then they decide how you are going to live
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:40.060]  all the way down to your health care and now they're the health care that they've
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:43.340]  had for free now they're starting to charge these people for it even though
[01:39:43.340 --> 01:39:49.340]  they're taking almost all of their money in taxes look at France this year
[01:39:49.340 --> 01:39:55.820]  passed a 101% tax on new wealthy and middle class I mean that's that's the
[01:39:55.820 --> 01:40:00.060]  actual French headline with a straight face but then the top French
[01:40:00.060 --> 01:40:04.500]  government socialists are all exempt and have Swiss bank accounts I mean the
[01:40:04.500 --> 01:40:09.380]  of course our taxes are going to be a hundred percent if the elite don't have
[01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:15.140]  to pay taxes because they're not under the same system it's outrageous and we're
[01:40:15.140 --> 01:40:18.900]  seeing revolts all across Europe against this people understand where this is
[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:23.060]  coming from to that degree they're angry about the the austerity programs I
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:27.180]  talked to the Italian there was an Italian blogger that was here they're
[01:40:27.180 --> 01:40:30.660]  very much aware of what happened because they've seen just like Greece they've
[01:40:30.660 --> 01:40:34.540]  seen their elected prime minister taken out of office and replaced by Goldman
[01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:38.340]  Sachs banker that's why he's here covering the Bilderberg he knows that
[01:40:38.340 --> 01:40:41.580]  these people are behind it and the people in Italy and the people in Greece are
[01:40:41.580 --> 01:40:46.020]  sadder but wiser than most of the other people but many of them still don't know
[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:49.640]  and still don't care and there's still a lot of people he said in Italy who don't
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:53.740]  know about Bilderberg the other upset about the fact that a banker was was
[01:40:53.740 --> 01:40:58.540]  put in the place of a duly elected politician because as much as the
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:02.220]  elections are rigged and we complain about the fact that we don't have honest
[01:41:02.220 --> 01:41:07.420]  and enough choices at least there's still the possibility if you've got
[01:41:07.420 --> 01:41:10.820]  elections at some point that you're going to have some input into the process
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:14.180]  something can be changed there's a hope of it what they're trying to do is take
[01:41:14.180 --> 01:41:18.260]  away even that hope that we could get back to open an honest and fair elections
[01:41:18.260 --> 01:41:22.500]  they want to dictate it as David Rockefeller has said from meetings like
[01:41:22.500 --> 01:41:26.820]  this where they have a technological elite and bankers are going to replace
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:29.460]  the nation-state
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:35.540]  day-to-night absolutely I was just thinking about what you had just said I
[01:41:35.540 --> 01:41:39.740]  know we're gonna get Paul Watson to pop in here in a little while for a brief
[01:41:39.740 --> 01:41:45.140]  update from him but I'm gonna cover some other news now any other things start
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:48.860]  breaking or unfolding I know we have live feeds up at info wars.com that you
[01:41:48.860 --> 01:41:53.420]  guys are putting out separate from this radio TV show but if anything starts
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:56.780]  happening important just call us right back and we'll put you back on air day
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:42:01.740]  at night. I want to get a closing comment from Josh Owens any other
[01:42:01.740 --> 01:42:09.460]  points he wants to make. Yeah I think regardless of what the earlier what we
[01:42:09.460 --> 01:42:12.180]  were talking about which was right which is right behind me where the cops
[01:42:12.180 --> 01:42:16.340]  drug the guy across I think regardless of whether the cops were doing it because
[01:42:16.340 --> 01:42:20.380]  he was harassing other people or not I don't it doesn't give them a right to
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:27.220]  grab him and you know drag him across the street literally behind the curtain
[01:42:27.220 --> 01:42:31.900]  you can see the curtain right here literally behind this and begin beating
[01:42:31.900 --> 01:42:37.300]  him regardless of what he was doing it's still wrong and regardless of I mean
[01:42:37.300 --> 01:42:41.300]  just because I'm walking with a camera maybe that says two things maybe it says
[01:42:41.300 --> 01:42:45.180]  that everyone's afraid of everything and they feel like first off they need to
[01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:51.420]  call the police yeah exactly East Germany it's just it's unbelievable and
[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:58.580]  it's not just over here it's in America too. Is Bilderberg what you thought it
[01:42:58.580 --> 01:43:06.260]  would be? So far yeah so far yeah actually I do have to give the cops some
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:10.700]  credit I think I was maybe bashing them a little too much earlier but I do have
[01:43:10.700 --> 01:43:18.820]  to give them some credit for at least being polite when they beat people. So
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:22.020]  they would have torn that guy's genitals off as long as they were polite it'd be
[01:43:22.020 --> 01:43:26.380]  okay. Oh yeah of course I mean they detain me but they were polite about it so
[01:43:26.380 --> 01:43:34.380]  I mean what can I do? What if they wore white gloves? I mean would that make it
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:42.860]  okay? They're generally more fit. Like at the airport? Yeah like at the airport yeah
[01:43:42.860 --> 01:43:46.380]  I think that that makes everything fine it's all about the illusion it's all
[01:43:46.380 --> 01:43:49.500]  about the appearance you know they can beat someone to death but if they're
[01:43:49.500 --> 01:43:54.900]  smiling while doing it. Alright Josh Jones will continue to get updates from
[01:43:54.900 --> 01:43:59.820]  you thank you so much. Thank you Alex. Okay folks I've got a bunch of news I want
[01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:05.020]  to hit and I want to take your phone calls on Bilderberg on the new Army
[01:44:05.020 --> 01:44:11.420]  document where they admit drones armored vehicles the military is for civil
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:19.420]  unrest and societal collapse. Department Defense Directive 3025.18 now the
[01:44:19.420 --> 01:44:24.340]  Washington Times is reporting on it good job but Washington Times you can say
[01:44:24.340 --> 01:44:28.340]  what you want about the late owner of the Washington Times the Reverend Kim
[01:44:28.340 --> 01:44:32.180]  Shung Moon or whatever his name was but they got a lot of great writers and good
[01:44:32.180 --> 01:44:37.100]  reporters over there like Joe Curl and Bill Gertz and others I mean real
[01:44:37.100 --> 01:44:41.660]  journalism. I mean you get public documents where they're preparing to use
[01:44:41.660 --> 01:44:46.220]  the military against the public I mean that's newsworthy and causing a public
[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:49.580]  debate about that is a big deal and you got to give credit for drudge the
[01:44:49.580 --> 01:44:53.220]  linking to it. I mean it's only a handful of news sites that continue to cover
[01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:59.900]  real issues and then we dominate and have giant traffic because people are
[01:44:59.900 --> 01:45:02.860]  fundamentally interested in this I'd like to hear from all of you out there
[01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:14.540]  the toll-free number to join us is 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 on this live
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:19.100]  Thursday edition we've got an hour and 15 minutes left in global transmission
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:25.540]  800 259 92 31 and we are going to go to break coming up here in a few minutes and
[01:45:25.540 --> 01:45:31.180]  come back and start taking your phone calls but let me go over some of these
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:35.820]  headlines intelligence committee doesn't care of targets are even identified
[01:45:35.820 --> 01:45:42.860]  before they're assassinated including US citizens congressional record show and
[01:45:42.860 --> 01:45:48.020]  the Washington's blogspot breaks it down from the congressional transcript
[01:45:48.020 --> 01:45:53.700]  directly from the Library of Congress that's up on infowars.com and I wanted
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:59.820]  to mention that article because in the Washington Times article directive
[01:45:59.820 --> 01:46:03.500]  outlines Obama's plan to use the military against citizens that I've got
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:07.820]  all my writers writing about right now fudge report.com has it linked in red
[01:46:07.820 --> 01:46:12.060]  on the right-hand side with this is so important that I'm gonna have three
[01:46:12.060 --> 01:46:16.860]  articles written about this today and tomorrow they can dole them on whatever
[01:46:16.860 --> 01:46:20.900]  they want from different angles because we need to put a focus on this because
[01:46:20.900 --> 01:46:25.060]  we're gonna expand on Gertz's article and give you the rest of the story where
[01:46:25.060 --> 01:46:28.060]  they say it's for the Tea Party and gun owners I'm gonna say that again the

[01:46:40.940 --> 01:46:47.020]  views okay we're all on list folks I mean this is a reason with a giant
[01:46:47.020 --> 01:46:55.380]  capital T and a lot of people think you're cowards the globalists think
[01:46:55.380 --> 01:46:58.620]  that you're gonna be intimidated by all this when the truth comes out that's
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:02.580]  why I've been told this the globalists are some of them aren't concerned if I'm
[01:47:02.580 --> 01:47:07.460]  on air because they think I'll just scare you I'm telling you this like you
[01:47:07.460 --> 01:47:12.100]  care your future is being robbed this is totally illegal totally illegitimate
[01:47:12.100 --> 01:47:24.420]  we haven't done Jack squad we haven't done anything in this country to deserve
[01:47:24.420 --> 01:47:29.860]  this and the people setting this up are the ones screwing over the economy
[01:47:29.860 --> 01:47:35.460]  shipping in the drugs opening up the borders bankrupting everything going
[01:47:35.460 --> 01:47:39.940]  after our liberties setting up death panels setting up Obamacare energy
[01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:48.460]  scams funding al-Qaeda fast and furious Benghazi it happened to us folks we have
[01:47:48.460 --> 01:47:53.180]  a out-of-control criminal government with an intimidated Congress made up of
[01:47:53.180 --> 01:47:58.460]  criminals and scum and perverts and blackmailed people and some good people
[01:47:58.460 --> 01:48:03.220]  that speak out or demonized but they're rising stars and it really hit me this
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:06.820]  morning the lesson is tell the truth look how popular Rand Paul is telling the
[01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:11.220]  truth front-runner for president runner-up Ted Cruz telling the truth
[01:48:11.220 --> 01:48:16.020]  probably be vice president if we get behind him doesn't mean they'll save
[01:48:16.020 --> 01:48:20.500]  everything but some step in the right direction we'll all save things together
[01:48:20.500 --> 01:48:26.380]  with God's help provenance you know during the whole new crisis that's been
[01:48:26.380 --> 01:48:29.940]  going on Putin's been praying at a monastery for five days straight a few
[01:48:29.940 --> 01:48:34.460]  weeks ago while Obama's out partying and golfing who do you think's gonna have
[01:48:34.460 --> 01:48:41.700]  the providence of God I'm not even saying Putin's a good guy but I mean when
[01:48:41.700 --> 01:48:46.180]  he had his nuclear emergency doomsday plane circling for five days when it
[01:48:46.180 --> 01:48:50.380]  when it looked like there was gonna be a war until the West and Russia both back
[01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:55.980]  down he was right there on the border with it at a monastery for five days in
[01:48:55.980 --> 01:49:00.380]  the news it said staying there and banks staying basically in a tower
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:05.700]  thinking about what he would do I mean even if he's a bad guy a normal person
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:09.620]  would isolate themselves with the data and really try to figure out what to do
[01:49:09.620 --> 01:49:15.140]  not be out playing golf and partying knowing to you know month four or
[01:49:15.140 --> 01:49:19.780]  whatever in the last year since this time last year that Obama's been on
[01:49:19.780 --> 01:49:24.860]  vacation four months since last May I saw an article a few days ago four months
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:30.940]  of vacation out of 12 I mean I don't get two weeks of real vacation a year I
[01:49:30.940 --> 01:49:35.900]  take days off just to do by counting and you know deal with the latest
[01:49:35.900 --> 01:49:45.020]  diversion can you imagine taking four months off I mean it's a joke people and
[01:49:45.020 --> 01:49:49.220]  then meanwhile there's that drones to kill whoever they're going oh by the way
[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:54.980]  we'll use them in America in the Department of Defense document yeah
[01:49:54.980 --> 01:49:59.860]  we're going to use military drones the American people do I get apologies from
[01:49:59.860 --> 01:50:05.460]  the Associated Press three years ago that ran articles saying I was a liar
[01:50:05.460 --> 01:50:10.900]  curtain him I was a liar Matt drudge was a liar no because the AP was running a
[01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:16.660]  psi op operation to tell everybody that doesn't exist it doesn't exist which is
[01:50:16.660 --> 01:50:23.420]  really another message the message is when this all comes out you're supposed
[01:50:23.420 --> 01:50:28.460]  to be kosher or you're supposed to be trendy you're supposed to be orthodox
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:33.420]  with the establishment and you're supposed to say it doesn't exist just
[01:50:33.420 --> 01:50:39.180]  like the 5,000 per person Obama fine under Obamacare just like Gibbs said
[01:50:39.180 --> 01:50:42.060]  you're not supposed to admit the drone program exist even though it publicly
[01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:48.600]  exists remember that clip I mean so I'm on a terrorist list because I know two
[01:50:48.600 --> 01:50:55.220]  plus two equals four fine fine I think the globalists have misjudged us I
[01:50:55.220 --> 01:50:58.020]  think we're gonna stand up to say none of this we have the moral authority we

[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:45.400]  to Copenhagen Denmark busy in Europe just ask different questions like that and
[02:01:45.400 --> 02:01:49.560]  secondly we need to hold our feet to the fire to corporate media last year I
[02:01:49.560 --> 02:01:56.120]  persuaded Jake Tapper of of the CNN globalist network to cover Bilderberg
[02:01:56.120 --> 02:02:01.200]  briefly I I tried to do it again this year put all these people accountable and
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:05.680]  again you look at the head Andres that Ross recently second NATO Secretary
[02:02:05.680 --> 02:02:10.040]  General and you or you look at one of the heads of the Massachusetts Institute
[02:02:10.040 --> 02:02:14.080]  of Technology Daniel as Daniel Esterlin on the show Alex talked about climate
[02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:18.320]  change and a technocracy being a topic at Bilderberg and when I did
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:22.160]  genetically modified society for your contest the film you can watch on YouTube
[02:02:22.160 --> 02:02:26.880]  I had the CFR admit to me that yes the president's looking at geoengineering so
[02:02:26.880 --> 02:02:30.440]  when you look at what they're going to be talking about at these meetings on
[02:02:30.440 --> 02:02:35.040]  top of the nationalist sentiment going on throughout the country is how do we
[02:02:35.040 --> 02:02:40.000]  break down these countries in a discreet way the army talks about
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:44.920]  weather modification as the perfect weapon to do so you have MIT you have
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:49.480]  all these globalist institutes talking about this so again keep up the great
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:52.800]  work everyone who's in Copenhagen keep keep those people in there in the
[02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:59.520]  prayers and keep up the great work and take care everyone take care Alex well
[02:02:59.520 --> 02:03:03.120]  said yeah Julio is a great reporter I guess he's still in college getting
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:05.720]  journalism degree but that's a lot of great work over the years done some for
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:09.560]  us and there he goes he's in front of Al Gore and many other people and
[02:03:09.560 --> 02:03:14.880]  anybody out there who has liberty who loves freedom and who knows the issues
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:18.920]  you're more important than dinosaur media because you're independent and
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:22.800]  yeah it's good to have CNBC cover it it's good to have the Guardian cover it
[02:03:22.800 --> 02:03:28.720]  but we're forcing them to cover it by leading the way that's how we got them
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:35.640]  to cover it and now in the case of CNBC and others they're kind of like yeah
[02:03:35.640 --> 02:03:39.480]  you got spies politicians and world leaders secretly meeting but what's the
[02:03:39.480 --> 02:03:43.400]  big deal but at least we're now going to start identifying these people which is
[02:03:43.400 --> 02:03:48.280]  what they don't want this is short segment long segment coming up I'm going

[02:09:57.120 --> 02:09:59.960]  Pentagon people that are concerned that they're training with drones and tanks
[02:09:59.960 --> 02:10:07.000]  to suppress the American people I mean it's total treason and it's here I want
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:12.840]  to go to Shane I want to go to mouse link Shane William Joe and many others
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:17.480]  let's go to Shane in North Carolina you're on the air welcome hey what's
[02:10:17.480 --> 02:10:21.360]  happening man they just want to let you know first and foremost that I'm
[02:10:21.360 --> 02:10:25.960]  engaging in our resistance at the moment I'm in my backyard as we speak
[02:10:25.960 --> 02:10:31.240]  watering my garden no sorry that's racist that is so racist first year I've
[02:10:31.240 --> 02:10:35.480]  ever really gotten into it I'm one of those one of those rally people who you
[02:10:35.480 --> 02:10:40.320]  know you had one of our friends on you know fluoride activists you know we're
[02:10:40.320 --> 02:10:45.320]  still working on them but I just decided to move 20 minutes out of the city get
[02:10:45.320 --> 02:10:50.680]  off the water grid on the well water got a you know acre land got chickens
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:55.160]  walking around my yard right now basically you're a hardcore extremist
[02:10:55.160 --> 02:10:59.160]  dangerous person now speaking of resistance man I've got a off I've got a
[02:10:59.160 --> 02:11:03.600]  good suggestion for you I think on your website you sell like a money belt but
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:11.000]  do you sell a a a money belt that has like quarters dimes nickels you know that
[02:11:11.000 --> 02:11:13.880]  kind of stuff or just money clips now we do have a little money clip that's made
[02:11:13.880 --> 02:11:18.000]  in America that we sell it made in 1776.com but we haven't come out with
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:22.040]  a with a little money clip that you know holds coins in it but that that would be
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:26.560]  a good idea because just the other day you know that the store I spend cash as
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:30.560]  much as possible but just the other day I happened to have exact change on me and
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:34.640]  I made a transaction and I thought to myself wow you know when you have exact
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:40.240]  change it's actually really easy to use cash but the big hassle a lot of
[02:11:40.240 --> 02:11:43.160]  establishments have whether that you know they'd have to have to have money on
[02:11:43.160 --> 02:11:46.160]  hand and they have to make change and all that but you should if you should
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:49.760]  really think about that have you know I hear you I hear and I appreciate your
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:54.880]  call I don't know we're gonna save cash ourselves doing that but Israel's moving
[02:11:54.880 --> 02:12:01.080]  trying to make you go to a casual society it's such a bad idea ladies and
[02:12:01.080 --> 02:12:06.720]  gentlemen such a horrible idea and I've got some news that dovetails that I'll
[02:12:06.720 --> 02:12:08.920]  be covering because I want to get into that article here in a moment but let's
[02:12:08.920 --> 02:12:14.840]  go back to calls right now mouse link you're on the air go ahead hi Alex the
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:18.280]  thing that I wanted to speak to you about that that's been blowing up on my
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:23.480]  Twitter feed for the past couple of days was this Washington Post film critic
[02:12:23.480 --> 02:12:28.680]  Anne Hornaday the one who said that the Santa Barbara shooting was quote tied
[02:12:28.680 --> 02:12:34.200]  to white men in Hollywood promoting escapist fantasies that revolve around
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:39.080]  vigilantism and sexual wish fulfillment
[02:12:39.360 --> 02:12:46.040]  Beth Rogan and Judd Apatow sir everything is white male's fault didn't you know
[02:12:46.040 --> 02:12:51.520]  that go ahead well and I'm one of them I guess so I guess I'm supposed to have
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:55.240]  that guilt coming down on my head constantly but the thing that I that I
[02:12:55.240 --> 02:12:59.040]  had said that seemed to resonate with a lot of people was that why can't we just
[02:12:59.040 --> 02:13:02.560]  blame these stabbing and the shootings on the people who perpetrate them but is
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:07.560]  that not self-serving enough well no that's it I mean look you need to be
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:11.680]  guilty and then politically do whoever's accusing you of being bad what
[02:13:11.680 --> 02:13:16.920]  they say and so let the Washington Post you know say that you are the reason
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:20.400]  this happened and of course I got real mad about this Sunday on the Sunday show
[02:13:20.400 --> 02:13:26.160]  I am sick of people blaming gun owners for what crazy people do with guns the
[02:13:26.160 --> 02:13:32.200]  guy killed half the people with a knife I guarantee you that the fathers and
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:35.720]  mothers of some of these dead young people have knives in their houses and
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:40.080]  they would say it's asinine if I said they shared guilt for having a knife
[02:13:40.080 --> 02:13:47.160]  half the people were killed with a knife I didn't hear Mr. Martinez that was
[02:13:47.160 --> 02:13:51.240]  blaming gun owners and the NRA for this come out and blame everyone that owns
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:56.440]  knives because he knows that's asinine well how is it any more asinine to
[02:13:56.440 --> 02:14:00.800]  blame guns and yes it is and we need to call them on this and you know I've
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:05.160]  mentioned the story you talk about it's just it's just incredible it's totally
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:10.800]  incredible but I mean they're now saying the word girl is sexist and banned
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:15.280]  they're saying the word bossy is while being bossy telling you not to use the
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:19.520]  word bossy if they can make you not use the word bossy they can do anything
[02:14:19.520 --> 02:14:24.800]  they're just seeing how many orders they can get us to follow I appreciate your
[02:14:24.800 --> 02:14:28.720]  call we're moving quick great calls shame another shame in Pennsylvania you're
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:34.920]  on the air Alex I just wanted to call in and commend the Info Wars crew and
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:42.280]  David Knight and Josh Evans out there in at Bilderberg it really shows who the
[02:14:42.280 --> 02:14:49.000]  real media is and you guys speak for the people and that's how we get the
[02:14:49.000 --> 02:14:55.680]  information into the mainstream and get these topics covered by mainstream news
[02:14:55.680 --> 02:15:02.480]  because their only purpose is to distort our reality most people know that
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:06.600]  something's wrong they know that things are right in this country and that we're
[02:15:06.600 --> 02:15:13.000]  being led astray but they turn on the news and everything seems okay but it's
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:18.280]  thanks to you guys thanks to Info Wars people are tuning in they're they're
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:23.600]  saying hey you know maybe I am I'm not crazy to think that you know we're in a
[02:15:23.600 --> 02:15:30.520]  lot of trouble and that things are you know going on well that's why we're
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:34.440]  here so many people and I appreciate your call Shane think I'm being a
[02:15:34.440 --> 02:15:41.520]  pessimist or fair mongering it's not fair mongering if it's happening the drug
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:44.640]  resistant bugs are killing millions worldwide every year now that's a big
[02:15:44.640 --> 02:15:48.720]  issue to worry about I want to try to cause a debate about it to find ways to
[02:15:48.720 --> 02:15:53.320]  try to mitigate it or fix it the globalist are coming for our guns it's by
[02:15:53.320 --> 02:15:57.160]  admitting they're coming for the guns that we can have a debate about it and
[02:15:57.160 --> 02:15:59.800]  point out that our guns make people safer and they don't have a right to blame
[02:15:59.800 --> 02:16:06.240]  us individually for what someone else does it's not fair mongering to say the
[02:16:06.240 --> 02:16:09.240]  big corporations want to censor the internet because the rise of new
[02:16:09.240 --> 02:16:13.720]  journalism is causing a new golden age of journalism
[02:16:17.000 --> 02:16:21.880]  I'm not a shenning or someone that thinks everything's doomed and we can't fix
[02:16:21.880 --> 02:16:25.800]  things my detractors are usually all you can't change it even if you're right
[02:16:25.800 --> 02:16:32.440]  there's nothing you can do oh sound like Igor the donkey from one of the poo I
[02:16:32.440 --> 02:16:40.520]  guess who E or whatever stupid name is E or is not Igor it's E or E or E or I
[02:16:40.520 --> 02:16:45.200]  guess that's the noise they make Igor I'll now call him Igor the minion of
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:53.560]  Dr. Frankenstein or like Renfield the donkey the vampire donkey Igor not of
[02:16:53.560 --> 02:17:00.840]  E or fame but of Igor fame but here's a new study out this is in the national
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:05.520]  post being a shenning linked to triple risk to developing dementia Finland
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:10.320]  study suggests yeah you decide life's all over you decide you're just depressed
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:15.560]  that's the way it is and you know I'm just gonna nothing's ever your body
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:20.840]  says well I'm not needed I'm just gonna die that's why in medicine they say
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:25.080]  praying helps even if you don't believe in God getting your brainwaves up getting
[02:17:25.080 --> 02:17:29.200]  to that higher level it's been proven that something's happening is highly
[02:17:29.200 --> 02:17:32.000]  associated with healing and pulling through stuff that's why you'll go on
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.400]  to somebody who's bleeding to death or whatever about to go into surgery buck
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:39.240]  up you're gonna make it you know decide you want to live and it's been shown
[02:17:39.240 --> 02:17:43.240]  statistically to massively boost your chances when you get put under to survive
[02:17:43.240 --> 02:17:48.440]  that surgery because your brain gets in the gear of I'm needed for this family
[02:17:48.440 --> 02:17:51.720]  you know there's big studies out that I've meant to cover last week that old
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:55.800]  people feel absolutely alone more and more in the West especially totally
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:59.840]  useless and it's because they decide they're useless their families is how
[02:17:59.840 --> 02:18:02.800]  they're useless they didn't have a bunch of kids so the kids don't want to come
[02:18:02.800 --> 02:18:07.480]  see him or they don't have kids and they want to be narcissistic and on power
[02:18:07.480 --> 02:18:11.200]  trips and that's not what being old is about your bills be narcissistic when
[02:18:11.200 --> 02:18:16.600]  you're 14 not when you're 70 not when you're 80 and that's what scientists and
[02:18:16.600 --> 02:18:21.160]  people are saying is stop being on a power trip stop being narcissistic
[02:18:21.160 --> 02:18:25.800]  decide you're gonna help people in the community go out to a soup kitchen and
[02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:29.600]  help homeless people when you're 80 years old you're like but I'm old I
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:34.800]  deserve to be happy now and have time for myself I you're not happy till you go
[02:18:34.800 --> 02:18:40.000]  to the soup kitchen or paint or or go visit a nursing home when you're 80 if
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:45.240]  you're not in bad shape for people that are in bad shape to take a therapy dog

[02:18:51.840 --> 02:18:56.040]  journalist that tells the truth that's a service doing good we're meant to try to

[02:19:01.640 --> 02:19:07.280]  to the tribe I'm gonna hang on they've got studies out on old women that live

[02:19:26.200 --> 02:19:30.800]  was coming to visit her on that Saturday when she died and I had a feeling
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:34.120]  to go see her and I ended up doing overnight radio show and was up late my
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:39.040]  dad came to the house stood over the bed and said hey get up we're going to
[02:19:39.040 --> 02:19:44.160]  fear and I said no I'll come later I'll come later I slept a few more hours he
[02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:48.200]  was miles away when she died and the preacher came and he said it's okay
[02:19:48.200 --> 02:19:52.360]  Patty you can turn loose you don't have to wait and she said okay and turn
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:57.080]  loose and died she just decided to die and that's what it's all about but

[02:24:22.240 --> 02:24:48.240]  I'm here to tell you folks the renegades are not the communists like rage against
[02:24:48.240 --> 02:24:56.560]  the machine would tell you Martin Luther King Mountain Match was definitely a
[02:24:56.560 --> 02:25:02.040]  renegade but then you plop communism on top of it that's not renegade that's
[02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:07.240]  establishment we cannot let them push communism is trending anymore I'm sick
[02:25:07.240 --> 02:25:11.800]  of it yeah communism is great for George Soros because he's exempt from it and he
[02:25:11.800 --> 02:25:18.080]  gets your money that pig let's go ahead and talk to Joe in California you're on
[02:25:18.080 --> 02:25:24.720]  here worldwide go ahead good afternoon mr. Jones um yeah so what I'm one thing
[02:25:24.720 --> 02:25:29.720]  I'm noticing on the media as they're just all the time really and hard for being
[02:25:29.720 --> 02:25:34.720]  jumbled here is that there's a lot of focus on Obama but not a whole lot of
[02:25:34.720 --> 02:25:39.840]  focus on Biden and I see that yeah Obama he takes a lot of vacations and
[02:25:39.840 --> 02:25:44.920]  everything but Biden though Biden tends to do a lot more actual work towards
[02:25:44.920 --> 02:25:49.520]  advancing the New World Order and I just feel that more focus should be
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:54.920]  shined on him as opposed to Obama who's really a distracting joke now here's the
[02:25:54.920 --> 02:26:00.200]  deal here's the deal I don't manipulate people but I will communicate and if I
[02:26:00.200 --> 02:26:05.360]  can get conservatives and libertarians angry about the New World Order by
[02:26:05.360 --> 02:26:11.360]  tagging Obama onto it because he is a figurehead for them so he deserves it
[02:26:11.360 --> 02:26:16.880]  you know his face is on the billboard for the company that I hate the globalist
[02:26:16.880 --> 02:26:22.640]  so he's the figurehead on the ship of these pirates so I will attack him by
[02:26:22.640 --> 02:26:26.920]  name and talk about him but it's pretty clear Obama is just reading off
[02:26:26.920 --> 02:26:31.680]  teleprompters and mailing it in like George W. Bush did Bill Clinton did not
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:38.160]  mail it in John F. Kennedy did not mail it in for good or for bad George Herbert
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:41.960]  Walker Bush did not mail it in they actually were globalist in their
[02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:46.840]  wheeling and dealing different factions Nixon did not mail it in Nixon was
[02:26:46.840 --> 02:26:50.680]  actually president that's why they destroyed him and that's on record the
[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:53.720]  establishment said that I'm not defending the stuff he did he was terrible
[02:26:53.720 --> 02:26:58.560]  but compared to these people he was an angel so I hear what you're saying you
[02:26:58.560 --> 02:27:04.000]  know Joe Biden is more of a president than Obama and does creep around trying
[02:27:04.000 --> 02:27:08.080]  to get our guns and you know the rest of it I mean they use Michelle Obama when
[02:27:08.080 --> 02:27:12.800]  I say Michelle Obama is telling our kids what to eat well she's the figurehead the
[02:27:12.800 --> 02:27:18.240]  woman on there doing it but really it's big agra the GMO Monsanto Bill among the
[02:27:18.240 --> 02:27:21.960]  Gates Foundation actually make a lot of the money off of it they actually run
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:25.560]  what your kids are fed to a great extent I mean Bill Gates is a control freak for
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:31.080]  Planned Parenthood his dad used to run it army intelligence top eugenicist and
[02:27:31.080 --> 02:27:35.600]  you're gonna eat what they say your kids gonna be sterile you know they say
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:38.240]  they're gonna shove a gun down your throat bulldozer you'll do it or they'll
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:41.720]  send the you know the media after you call your racist and you don't want to
[02:27:41.720 --> 02:27:45.280]  don't want that to happen so yeah no we're in a twilight zone episode I mean
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:48.360]  it's crazy that's why I hear what you're saying about Joe Biden I appreciate
[02:27:48.360 --> 02:27:54.640]  your call William and Pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead hi Alex let's
[02:27:54.640 --> 02:27:58.120]  drop a thank you for covering everything like you do and they give some
[02:27:58.120 --> 02:28:05.200]  assistance as well thank you you know but what I like to talk about is is there
[02:28:05.200 --> 02:28:08.840]  anything more we could do to wake up the people because most of the stuff is
[02:28:08.840 --> 02:28:12.400]  pretty in the obvious I just don't understand how people could be so
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:17.040]  blind and passive you see that's how incrementalism works back before folks
[02:28:17.040 --> 02:28:21.000]  were totally asleep before they've been conditioned to handle this stuff in
[02:28:21.000 --> 02:28:24.960]  plain view they'd go there's no world government there's no secret room
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:29.320]  there's no Bilderberg there's no plan for socialist healthcare there's no plan
[02:28:29.320 --> 02:28:34.240]  nothing there's no plan to get your guns and no no there's no secret medical
[02:28:34.240 --> 02:28:38.840]  experiments now that it's all out in the open they go yeah we take foster kids
[02:28:38.840 --> 02:28:44.520]  and do medical experiments on them some died big deal yeah we're yeah we're
[02:28:44.520 --> 02:28:49.920]  doing on what's wrong with that see I mean we're now getting down the line
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:54.120]  yeah we're gonna get rid of internet freedom yeah we're gonna take your bank
[02:28:54.120 --> 02:28:58.560]  account yeah your kid belongs to the government see that's what team got a
[02:28:58.560 --> 02:29:06.920]  problem yeah yeah see how that works yeah exactly I mean I just don't
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:10.520]  understand it I mean especially with the coverage that over I'm both about
[02:29:10.520 --> 02:29:15.560]  learn right now with it with the reporter getting drugged behind well
[02:29:15.560 --> 02:29:19.440]  maybe he needs to be drugged behind there you know maybe he needs to be
[02:29:19.440 --> 02:29:23.200]  beaten and stomped all of the chased out of the reporter maybe they mean we
[02:29:23.200 --> 02:29:27.600]  need to arrest all the media stop complaining let them take our bank
[02:29:27.600 --> 02:29:31.520]  accounts let them take our kids let them give us four shots the people running
[02:29:31.520 --> 02:29:37.120]  things are good and they mean well and it's mentally ill to think government
[02:29:37.120 --> 02:29:41.920]  ever did anything wrong or the special interests are wrong okay I want to be
[02:29:41.920 --> 02:29:46.600]  mainstream now I love Michelle Obama and I love the school lunches and I didn't

[02:35:25.120 --> 02:35:30.800]  here's the best of Bilderberg's unveiling or the unmasking of Bilderberg in the
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:34.720]  last eight years I don't know what you call this Bilderberg unmask I think
[02:35:34.720 --> 02:35:38.920]  it's probably a good name for it here's part of that for the radio and TV

[02:35:55.880 --> 02:36:09.200]  here's part of this report
[02:36:26.640 --> 02:36:31.180]  on the outskirts of the national capital today black limousines with darkened
[02:36:31.180 --> 02:36:36.380]  windows converged on hotel where private security guards imposed iron-clad
[02:36:36.380 --> 02:36:42.040]  control is known as the Bilderberg group could their objective be world
[02:36:42.040 --> 02:36:46.800]  domination it was just scary I mean I've again I've been all over the world and
[02:36:46.800 --> 02:36:51.480]  I've never seen anything like this it was like hours of humiliation and they
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:55.960]  said what are you here for and I said well I'm here to you know cover the media
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:36:59.040]  covering a political event I'll talk to some members of Parliament I was answering
[02:36:59.040 --> 02:37:01.960]  all the questions it's clear I wasn't a threat it was clear I didn't have any criminal record
[02:37:01.960 --> 02:37:05.000]  it was clear I was pressed it was clear I was coming in to interview people they
[02:37:05.000 --> 02:37:08.320]  were gonna deny me that they told me earlier that I was probably gonna be
[02:37:08.320 --> 02:37:13.200]  denied and then you guys showed up and everything changed they're debating the
[02:37:13.200 --> 02:37:16.800]  attack on Iran they're talking about how to take out Hugo Chavez they're
[02:37:16.800 --> 02:37:20.840]  talking about how to get their American Union in the destroyers Canadian US and
[02:37:20.840 --> 02:37:24.280]  Mexican sovereignty so we're talking about the death of Canada's what's
[02:37:24.280 --> 02:37:27.800]  happening in there right now the death of your sovereignty is happening in
[02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:32.400]  there right now hundred and twenty of the world's most powerful men heads of
[02:37:32.400 --> 02:37:36.880]  state from Europe high officials United States government Treasury White House
[02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:42.680]  State Defense they're setting the world agenda now the reason they won't
[02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:48.000]  secrecy is cause they're doing evil evil is done under cover of darkness good
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:51.520]  works are done in the sunshine right on to the site yeah there's no implication
[02:37:51.520 --> 02:37:58.000]  that we aren't a cooperative side but last year it took me fourteen and a half
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:02.400]  hours to get to Munich I was pulled off the plane in Milan I was pulled up the
[02:38:02.400 --> 02:38:06.480]  plane in Munich they interrogated me for hours they basically told me that they'll
[02:38:06.480 --> 02:38:11.160]  keeping an eye on me 24 hours of the gate the little hotel but we were staying
[02:38:11.160 --> 02:38:15.560]  at Jim and I out of the 20 room six were occupied three by the CIA and three by
[02:38:15.560 --> 02:38:20.720]  German Secret Service that's how serious these people are and that's how
[02:38:20.720 --> 02:38:24.160]  afraid they are actually what we may be able to reveal and what we actually do
[02:38:24.160 --> 02:38:26.160]  reveal
[02:38:41.160 --> 02:38:44.720]  so what they're going to do over the next year year and a half is to bring the
[02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:49.240]  market back up to it 1998 1999 levels they can get all the suckers to invest
[02:38:49.240 --> 02:38:52.840]  whatever little money they have left over and that's when they're going to make
[02:38:52.840 --> 02:38:56.200]  the economy's bottom drop out they need to destroy the economy
[02:38:56.200 --> 02:38:59.600]  actually members of their members of the bill about four years and years and
[02:38:59.600 --> 02:39:02.600]  years they've been going and participating in all the conversations
[02:39:02.600 --> 02:39:07.920]  they've always been dead on always get them on both sides yeah you're
[02:39:07.920 --> 02:39:15.800]  correct yeah you're gonna go jail at Kinley oh yeah there's one right there
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:20.720]  hi hey we're not your property we're not your slaves we're gonna defeat the
[02:39:20.720 --> 02:39:44.880]  new world order Jim my governor Rick Perry it's in the front of the Dallas
[02:39:44.880 --> 02:39:50.880]  Morning News the headline reads Texas governor Rick Perry to attend Bilderberg
[02:39:50.880 --> 02:39:54.720]  what does it mean to have the governor of Texas in the Dallas Morning News just
[02:39:54.720 --> 02:39:59.880]  admitting he's going to Bilderberg group that means he's a potential president
[02:39:59.880 --> 02:40:05.360]  even as the obscure governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton lost his virginity at the
[02:40:05.360 --> 02:40:09.880]  Bilderberg meeting in bottom-bottom Germany in 1991 and he's elected
[02:40:09.880 --> 02:40:15.280]  president the following year we were the Mitch Carlton it looked like a typical
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:19.240]  Bilderberg scenario they had the armed guards all around the place they had
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:26.320]  platoons of cops in formation wait for this person but they also had cops all
[02:40:26.320 --> 02:40:30.600]  the way around the building and they had all those high-tech things where every
[02:40:30.600 --> 02:40:37.080]  member can hear whatever spoken in any language instantly translated to his own
[02:40:37.080 --> 02:40:41.480]  language we're going directly into the belly of the beast the hotel will be
[02:40:41.480 --> 02:40:47.880]  filled with at least five spy agencies CIA defense intelligence facade
[02:40:47.880 --> 02:40:54.800]  European Union security we're sitting here in the room as the phone rings with
[02:40:54.800 --> 02:40:59.720]  your producer Tom Danhizer to put me on the fire alarm goes off so everybody is
[02:40:59.720 --> 02:41:03.720]  exiting the building I know this is a setup they timed it exactly when this
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:07.400]  happened open the door I wanted to hear the fire alarm we have a security guy
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:11.760]  walk up to us 30 minutes ago about 25 minutes ago before this happened and
[02:41:11.760 --> 02:41:13.800]  said what are you guys doing we said we're just walking around checking out
[02:41:13.800 --> 02:41:16.840]  the artwork in the hotel which we actually were admiring and we were also
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:20.360]  going around getting some footage and I said well no cameras allowed we said fine
[02:41:20.360 --> 02:41:25.240]  and then he said yeah we had somebody do a fire alarm a few weeks ago and me and
[02:41:25.240 --> 02:41:29.480]  Rob my camera guy wrong why's he telling us about a fire alarm I forgot that part
[02:41:29.480 --> 02:41:32.800]  George these bastards have done this I don't know how they're planning to try to
[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:36.000]  set us up or something but this is incredible we are here in the middle of
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:39.040]  this right now George
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:43.200]  yeah we got a car up behind us
[02:41:46.040 --> 02:41:52.440]  this is some of the highlights of the last eight years at Bilderberg meetings
[02:41:52.440 --> 02:41:57.520]  Switzerland's coming up and a lot more we're gonna post the full video to
[02:41:57.520 --> 02:42:01.000]  YouTube right now also have the whole thing on the nightly news tonight may
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:03.440]  have aired last night I think we're premiering her today dude was telling
[02:42:03.440 --> 02:42:09.120]  me and then we'll have that up on info wars.com for you I want to take you
[02:42:09.120 --> 02:42:14.800]  now live to Paul Watson who is acting like the wasselhoff as he's secretly
[02:42:14.800 --> 02:42:22.200]  known that that's Watson meets David Hasselhoff and he's been able to get
[02:42:22.200 --> 02:42:25.680]  all the groupies away all the Danish blondes that are literally chasing him
[02:42:25.680 --> 02:42:32.800]  around and now look how ridiculous I like Watson I was teasing him early for
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:36.320]  being gone for like two hours in interviews which I wanted him to do I
[02:42:36.320 --> 02:42:41.080]  just didn't know that he'd be gone all day because I got to be honest articles
[02:42:41.080 --> 02:42:44.840]  he writes will be more important and read more than going on RT or on Danish
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:48.360]  television or whatever else he did and this show it is just that you know he's
[02:42:48.360 --> 02:42:55.080]  our reporter but but it's a sign of success that the wasselhoff has been
[02:42:55.080 --> 02:42:59.600]  doing good so go ahead and smile again look at her it's like the Grinch or
[02:42:59.600 --> 02:43:03.160]  something all right anyways Watson I always start getting dingy in the third
[02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:09.360]  hour it's a phenomenon we can't help it I'm known as the walrus off by the
[02:43:09.360 --> 02:43:13.960]  ladies no but seriously Watson tell us what you think about what's been
[02:43:13.960 --> 02:43:20.800]  unfolding today well we started off in the morning a track in the delegates
[02:43:20.800 --> 02:43:25.560]  coming in it was very slow to begin with so we were over in the press area next
[02:43:25.560 --> 02:43:29.920]  to the the opposite side of the hotel then we came within this area which is
[02:43:29.920 --> 02:43:34.240]  obviously directly opposite the main building we weren't allowed in here at
[02:43:34.240 --> 02:43:38.800]  first but later on they allowed us to be here and now yeah we got the Queen of
[02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:43.040]  Spain we got portray us to our Peter Thiel we got a lot of interesting
[02:43:43.040 --> 02:43:47.200]  individuals arriving one of the most funny things was that several of them
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:52.000]  decided to go on a little jog including David portray us around it around
[02:43:52.000 --> 02:43:57.960]  Copenhagen so that was quite funny to see that but yes it's been intense we went
[02:43:57.960 --> 02:44:01.640]  in the I went in the protest area a little bit earlier then obviously dashing
[02:44:01.640 --> 02:44:07.300]  back and forth for interviews so and when I was here in the protest area the
[02:44:07.300 --> 02:44:11.920]  Bilderberg members were up in the corridor which is the one of the main
[02:44:11.920 --> 02:44:15.680]  windows they're going up just past the elevator which we were in that hotel the
[02:44:15.680 --> 02:44:18.960]  night and they were they were stood there looking out the window laughing at
[02:44:18.960 --> 02:44:24.800]  us basically on several different floors so we're interested in them and
[02:44:24.800 --> 02:44:28.800]  they're very interested in us oh yes it's so funny that we forced coverage of
[02:44:28.800 --> 02:44:33.360]  their criminal activities it's so funny that the peasants are exposing their
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:37.760]  corporate global government it's so funny that tea party type candidates are
[02:44:37.760 --> 02:44:41.840]  getting elected from Europe to Africa from Latin America to the US to
[02:44:41.840 --> 02:44:47.160]  Australia it's so funny that we're identifying them no this is all part of
[02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:53.480]  their confidence act exactly some of them you know scoot away pretty quickly
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:56.480]  they don't want to be seen but some of them just come outside and take a good
[02:44:56.480 --> 02:45:01.400]  long lockers and as I said up in the window doing the same thing so some of
[02:45:01.400 --> 02:45:04.280]  them aren't ashamed of what they're doing some of them are they've still got
[02:45:04.280 --> 02:45:09.920]  two spots is on the roof people were saying earlier in the protest pen that
[02:45:09.920 --> 02:45:14.120]  they were snipers I haven't seen any evidence of that they've definitely got
[02:45:14.120 --> 02:45:18.960]  binoculars they're up on both corners of the main block of the Marriott building
[02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:22.680]  and they've been watching us carefully all day and there are two of them now
[02:45:22.680 --> 02:45:27.800]  there's only one earlier even though there's absolutely nobody in the protest
[02:45:27.800 --> 02:45:33.520]  zone now they've all gone home it's literally five or six reporters just
[02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:39.240]  stood here the protest zone looks like a concentration camp it's a free speech
[02:45:39.240 --> 02:45:42.480]  pain yeah they don't actually let you get in it directly you have to walk
[02:45:42.480 --> 02:45:46.360]  around several blocks just to get in it so they make it difficult even to get
[02:45:46.360 --> 02:45:50.200]  into there well I'm glad that folks are just ignoring that and going out and
[02:45:50.200 --> 02:45:53.600]  covering it as the press have you had any trouble with the police or have they
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:46:00.600]  best been dragging off other reporters I haven't had any trouble with them there
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:04.760]  was an incident earlier where they grabbed somebody who was to be fair acting
[02:46:04.760 --> 02:46:10.360]  like a bit volunetic they detained him they didn't arrest him because he was
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:14.240]  released soon afterwards so they're lovingly and they also lovingly
[02:46:14.240 --> 02:46:20.880]  stomped on him yeah they were they were very rough with him he was walking
[02:46:20.880 --> 02:46:25.840]  around harassing people basically so mixed feelings about that you have a
[02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:31.400]  little bit of a satisfied look on your face you should have heard what he was
[02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:35.880]  saying about you I already heard about it I love it I know it's like I'm like
[02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:38.920]  those darn police me was like Alex Jones is evil
[02:46:38.920 --> 02:46:44.880]  cops like me well I still don't like it I still don't like the fact they
[02:46:44.880 --> 02:46:48.360]  chased the other reporter that was trying to get footage of it let the guy do
[02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:53.200]  that as long as he doesn't hit anybody he has a right to do it well he didn't do
[02:46:53.200 --> 02:46:56.600]  anything that was an arrestable offense really or the reason to be detained
[02:46:56.600 --> 02:47:00.680]  once they grabbed him he started struggling but generally they've been
[02:47:00.680 --> 02:47:05.200]  quite polite whether it maintain I mean you know Bilderberg is stealing their
[02:47:05.200 --> 02:47:09.160]  pensions too which they don't realize so maybe they're starting to look into it
[02:47:09.160 --> 02:47:14.720]  a little bit and come over to our side as is usual by the way I was not making
[02:47:14.720 --> 02:47:18.880]  funny with a wasselhoff thing you actually got the idea of a joke t-shirt as
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:25.240]  you as the wasselhoff I think we should definitely roll with that I think it'd
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:30.640]  be a big seller this spotter guy is still on the roof even though there's
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:35.960]  basically nobody here that's a good way to change the subject wasselhoff that's
[02:47:35.960 --> 02:47:39.400]  just that I noticed him he's peering over at us again should we tell folks
[02:47:39.400 --> 02:47:45.400]  your other nickname what's that Alex me and Watson probably talk 30 minutes
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:49.920]  every morning about news and in 12 years is it 13 or 14 years you've been
[02:47:49.920 --> 02:47:57.120]  working with me Waddy since October 2002 so 12 years nearly now yeah so that's
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:00.720]  why I joke around a lot with Paul I shouldn't do it Paul's very reserved on
[02:48:00.720 --> 02:48:05.960]  TV and the radio but he's actually a wild man behind the scenes folks
[02:48:07.560 --> 02:48:12.320]  alright anyways hey when are you and your wife gonna come over here I keep
[02:48:12.320 --> 02:48:15.800]  saying I'll fly over here for a business meeting slash vacation you keep
[02:48:15.800 --> 02:48:20.520]  having excuses when it gets colder if I come now I'll shrivel up Alex it's too
[02:48:20.520 --> 02:48:26.720]  hot maybe October he does this all the time and then in October I promise Alex
[02:48:26.720 --> 02:48:32.520]  I will come this year there are more cars arriving there are more attendees
[02:48:32.520 --> 02:48:37.640]  arriving at Bilderberg right now just pulling into the main entrance all right
[02:48:37.640 --> 02:48:42.600]  well a lot's going on man I tell you did you hear about this Bill Gertz article
[02:48:42.600 --> 02:48:45.960]  I guess you didn't talk to you about this morning where he's got the army documents
[02:48:45.960 --> 02:48:48.720]  where they admit they're trying to take on the American people just period I
[02:48:48.720 --> 02:48:55.040]  mean this is so illegal Paul no I was I was too preoccupied with trying to get
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:48:59.960]  the live stream on him for wars but there's a there are more delegates
[02:48:59.960 --> 02:49:03.760]  arriving pretty late now as you can see on the video stream yeah cuz it's like
[02:49:03.760 --> 02:49:10.080]  what is it like is it like eight at night over there right now it's um it's
[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:15.000]  ten to nine it's eight fifty yeah wow so I guess it's an hour later than it is
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:20.160]  in England huh Greenwich yeah that's right yeah all right well listen you've
[02:49:20.160 --> 02:49:23.240]  done a great job and obviously you guys should be able to take off the rest of
[02:49:23.240 --> 02:49:27.000]  the day now it's a long hours get some more of the delegates arriving then see
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:31.720]  if you can creep around at night on top of any of those other buildings with a
[02:49:31.720 --> 02:49:35.640]  telephoto lens if you guys want to you don't have to you're tired to get
[02:49:35.640 --> 02:49:40.280]  footage inside those rooms because they've been putting up that mesh to
[02:49:40.280 --> 02:49:45.600]  block out the windows I've never seen them do that before yeah they were doing
[02:49:45.600 --> 02:49:50.240]  something on the other side of the building as well that we saw so I've
[02:49:50.240 --> 02:49:54.440]  actually seen it Bohemian Grove and I'm not joking now and John Ronson saw this
[02:49:54.440 --> 02:49:58.680]  with me he wrote about in his book them Henry Kissinger dressed in drag bent
[02:49:58.680 --> 02:50:04.440]  over doing something I can't mention on the radio and so you know I mean I guess
[02:50:04.440 --> 02:50:07.440]  he's getting with the times we should put him on the cover of Time magazine the
[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:13.440]  transgender tipping point led by Henry Kissinger what do you think I think maybe
[02:50:13.440 --> 02:50:17.280]  you should put it on the front of the Info Wars magazine I think that would be
[02:50:17.280 --> 02:50:24.640]  a big seller as well with Diane Feinstein dresses a man on the other side you
[02:50:24.640 --> 02:50:29.280]  want to be fair right yeah you know I don't want to be sexist about it Alex
[02:50:29.280 --> 02:50:34.400]  come on it's a great idea all right hey Watson seriously great job there great
[02:50:34.400 --> 02:50:38.760]  job Bilderberg 2014 a lot of media coverage gotta say the dinosaur media is
[02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:43.240]  covering it now what do you think of that Watson it was it was very slow
[02:50:43.240 --> 02:50:47.520]  yesterday but the seems the trickle is turning into a deluge I think the
[02:50:47.520 --> 02:50:51.320]  London evening standard described it as catnip for lizard obsessed conspiracy
[02:50:51.320 --> 02:50:54.840]  theorists they're not here obviously they know absolutely nothing about it but

[02:55:18.000 --> 02:55:22.320]  patreon supply dot com let's go back to Paul Paul what was the other point you
[02:55:22.320 --> 02:55:27.960]  were making I was just talking to Danish media it's a mainstream channel quite
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:32.400]  big here earlier and this woman this reporter was saying that they're in
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:37.160]  regular contact with the organizers and some of the Bilderberg members made it
[02:55:37.160 --> 02:55:41.440]  quite apparent that they were managing the coverage with this Danish TV channel
[02:55:41.440 --> 02:55:44.920]  so I just stress the point that you know they do have power this is important
[02:55:44.920 --> 02:55:49.520]  this is bigger than Davos in terms of influence and she made it clear that they
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:53.320]  were working together with the Danish media to manage the coverage of this
[02:55:53.320 --> 02:55:56.960]  event so I found that interesting they are talking to the protesters though so
[02:55:56.960 --> 02:56:01.480]  they are trying to give it both sides of voice but I found that interesting that
[02:56:01.480 --> 02:56:05.480]  she would say that any other points that you're gonna wish you made when I let
[02:56:05.480 --> 02:56:10.320]  you go here in about a minute now just the photos of them looking out that the
[02:56:10.320 --> 02:56:14.240]  windows as they're on real Alex Jones Twitter had zoomed in so should built to
[02:56:14.240 --> 02:56:17.040]  see them on there oh great job all I didn't even know that in between all the
[02:56:17.040 --> 02:56:20.240]  interviews other work well I salute you and the crew you guys are definitely
[02:56:20.240 --> 02:56:24.640]  getting a bonus for this one and keep doing it Watson all right thanks Alex
[02:56:24.640 --> 02:56:28.480]  maybe while I take these calls we can show the real Alex Jones Twitter photos
[02:56:28.480 --> 02:56:33.240]  the latest ones and show the TV viewers some of that let's jam in a call right
[02:56:33.240 --> 02:56:37.960]  now he hadn't been holding the longest but I got to talk to Al Qaeda sure I
[02:56:37.960 --> 02:56:42.080]  should say I'll see I Ada hey you're getting funded by Obama to blow up
[02:56:42.080 --> 02:56:45.560]  churches everywhere how you doing now I guess I'm the real terrorist I'm a tea
[02:56:45.560 --> 02:56:50.880]  partier a proto tea partier how you doing Al Qaeda in Georgia I'm doing great
[02:56:50.880 --> 02:56:56.520]  Alex I taught you about four years ago and you asked if I work for the
[02:56:56.520 --> 02:57:01.640]  government I said no but I am definitely white Al Qaeda oh well they have been
[02:57:01.640 --> 02:57:05.680]  segueing on to the white males being the main terror threat so I guess I get
[02:57:05.680 --> 02:57:13.000]  your job now understand exactly now our lovely mayor out here in Atlanta is there
[02:57:13.000 --> 02:57:19.960]  with Paul and I was very glad to hear that and that's a joke of course but
[02:57:19.960 --> 02:57:25.760]  what I called in about was the awakening the last time I talked to you you were
[02:57:25.760 --> 02:57:34.360]  asking what is it gonna take for the wake up and what to you was that it's
[02:57:34.360 --> 02:57:40.800]  gonna take them individually being affected by our system in some way now
[02:57:40.800 --> 02:57:47.440]  they're doing enough that sooner or later we're gonna wake up everybody and
[02:57:47.440 --> 02:57:50.840]  that's why they got the police state in place so they want to have a civil war
[02:57:50.840 --> 02:57:54.640]  which is an even bigger crisis to give them more power and I think they've
[02:57:54.640 --> 02:57:57.680]  overcooked the goose I don't think it's gonna work for them I think their
[02:57:57.680 --> 02:58:02.760]  program is half-baked on a lot of levels saying everybody's already waking up
[02:58:02.760 --> 02:58:07.680]  what's gonna happen when they just do something and everybody just you can't

[03:00:27.200 --> 03:00:32.120]  brain chips on troops to augment activity but also treat PTSD you name it I
[03:00:32.120 --> 03:00:35.680]  was called an insane person even when I had family that said they were being
[03:00:35.680 --> 03:00:39.040]  microchipped with tracker chips and special forces but that I couldn't say
[03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:42.880]  the name people said it wasn't true now that's all admitted the military's
[03:00:42.880 --> 03:00:46.920]  building brain chips to treat PTSD that's from defense one we can punch up

[03:00:51.680 --> 03:00:56.320]  challenges graduating Air Force Academy cadets to create a new world order when
[03:00:56.320 --> 03:01:00.680]  they say new order they mean a global corporate military as the cadets smoke
[03:01:00.680 --> 03:01:05.480]  cigars I'm prepared to have their whole world destroyed by the global
[03:01:05.480 --> 03:01:11.720]  technocrats unbelievable let's go to your phone calls oh I'm sorry we have the
[03:01:11.720 --> 03:01:16.280]  clip of Biden why should I just read you the headline out of a scars and stripes
[03:01:16.280 --> 03:01:19.400]  when I can play you the clip because the New York Times will say this clip
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:23.960]  doesn't exist if we don't play the clip here I believe we and particularly you
[03:01:23.960 --> 03:01:32.120]  your class has an incredible window of opportunity to lead in shaping a new
[03:01:32.120 --> 03:01:37.960]  world order for the 21st century out of these troubled times in a way consistent
[03:01:37.960 --> 03:01:43.680]  a new world order marriage and the common interest oh yeah the common
[03:01:43.680 --> 03:01:49.920]  interest you care about the possibility death panels you know for the first time in history that's enough of him
[03:01:49.920 --> 03:01:54.760]  the Western let's talk to Damien in Indiana you're on the air thank you for
[03:01:54.760 --> 03:02:00.040]  holding hi first of all you got great taste in music from rage against the
[03:02:00.040 --> 03:02:05.440]  machine to Jimmy Dean I thought that was pretty good and I feel like I've got
[03:02:05.440 --> 03:02:10.120]  about 45 minutes worth of stuff to talk to you about but I do want to say that
[03:02:10.120 --> 03:02:14.880]  you're given the right advice for older adults to stay active that's the field I'm
[03:02:14.880 --> 03:02:21.240]  in I'm a PhD in that area been working with older adults for 14 years and I'm
[03:02:21.240 --> 03:02:24.800]  giving good advice you know all the studies show it and crabby people that
[03:02:24.800 --> 03:02:27.720]  have a bad attitude your body just shuts off and you die and that's what the new
[03:02:27.720 --> 03:02:32.640]  study says exactly I'm also a member of Mensa and I know you had a kind of a
[03:02:32.640 --> 03:02:37.760]  coupcaller about two months ago or two weeks ago but here I'll prove it your
[03:02:37.760 --> 03:02:42.160]  globe at the beginning of the segment or at the end your show spins the wrong
[03:02:42.160 --> 03:02:49.280]  direction and I've noticed that myself but we kind of like that okay but I'm a
[03:02:49.280 --> 03:02:53.200]  relatively new listener about a year or so that I've been listening and I wanted
[03:02:53.200 --> 03:02:58.880]  to know if you could review how the globalist started with this whole this
[03:02:58.880 --> 03:03:04.000]  whole idea what was there I mean you'd have to guess at what they were thinking
[03:03:04.000 --> 03:03:08.120]  but what were what oh they've told us I mean they've written a lot of books on
[03:03:08.120 --> 03:03:12.280]  it David Rockefeller wrote one memoirs in 2004 they took the ideas of plate up
[03:03:12.280 --> 03:03:18.400]  and then of other empires that came after the Greek Empire and they see us
[03:03:18.400 --> 03:03:22.880]  as animals and they just use systems of social control and augmented them and
[03:03:22.880 --> 03:03:26.560]  expanded on them to make a more sophisticated and they've just decided
[03:03:26.560 --> 03:03:31.080]  it's easier to be evil and not care about people and to teach us to be immoral
[03:03:31.080 --> 03:03:37.680]  and they just give it into what's easy and they are trying to extinct what they
[03:03:37.680 --> 03:03:41.600]  call morals because they believe they're beyond good and evil and then it's
[03:03:41.600 --> 03:03:45.280]  social Darwinism and that it's their right to do anything they want because
[03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:51.680]  the fact that they're dominant proves in the scheme of evolution that they
[03:03:51.680 --> 03:03:57.280]  should be in full control and so Plato said exterminate the underclasses and
[03:03:57.280 --> 03:04:01.200]  that's what they want to do but first they have to dumb us down make us poor and
[03:04:01.200 --> 03:04:06.320]  prove we're scum before they can kill us and so that's what's happening right
[03:04:06.320 --> 03:04:10.720]  now do you feel we have a certain window here because I think in two more
[03:04:10.720 --> 03:04:16.760]  generations we're gonna have a complete zombie population no no I've had a
[03:04:16.760 --> 03:04:20.640]  leech that say I've had a leech say to me you should join us that was a while
[03:04:20.640 --> 03:04:24.480]  back I think the windows close me never do that you know these people don't want
[03:04:24.480 --> 03:04:28.440]  your help and you're wrong and we're right and the public wants to die we
[03:04:28.440 --> 03:04:33.240]  tell them we're killing them and they want it and so you know Alex the fact
[03:04:33.240 --> 03:04:37.600]  that we're in control shows we should be in control and I don't know why they
[03:04:37.600 --> 03:04:40.960]  don't just spray us with the agent orange and get the whole thing over with
[03:04:40.960 --> 03:04:45.560]  well that that they they will if we keep not noticing they'll move on to more
[03:04:45.560 --> 03:04:50.280]  direct assaults and you notice they're turning stuff up now because they've
[03:04:50.280 --> 03:04:55.080]  gotten away with it so yep they they they want to put in a planetary government
[03:04:55.080 --> 03:04:58.560]  and then they're gonna kill it most people with a bio weapon probably all
[03:04:58.560 --> 03:05:23.600]  right I'm out of time sorry the other callers
