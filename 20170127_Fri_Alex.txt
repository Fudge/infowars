[00:00.000 --> 00:09.720]  It's Friday, seven days in, and Trump is delivering massively.
[00:09.720 --> 00:13.360]  In fact, even CNN admits this is unprecedented.
[00:13.360 --> 00:16.800]  They said it's an obsession.
[00:16.800 --> 00:21.320]  Trump is obsessed with doing what he said he would do.
[00:21.320 --> 00:29.120]  Mass resignations, mass firings, spending freezes, hiring freezes, program freezes on
[00:29.120 --> 00:30.120]  new spending.
[00:30.120 --> 00:32.800]  It's incredible how he's delivering.
[00:32.800 --> 00:36.920]  Now I did extra preparation today, so much that I'm almost not even ready to get on
[00:36.920 --> 00:42.400]  air via what we've been discovering the last few days, Rob do was up here late last night.
[00:42.400 --> 00:46.960]  It's coming up later in the broadcast because it's so big, I can't just, you know, release
[00:46.960 --> 00:48.600]  this without fanfare.
[00:48.600 --> 00:53.960]  We've discovered studies and more proof that Trump is more than right about the illegals.
[00:53.960 --> 00:58.520]  But first off, here's a key report about some of the spoiled brat brainwashers out there
[00:58.520 --> 01:00.640]  by Paul Joseph Watson.
[01:00.640 --> 01:05.400]  Shia LeBeouf is a narcissistic attention whore who has to compensate for all the shitty
[01:05.400 --> 01:11.560]  movies he's been in by constantly acting like a mentally ill thug to get media coverage.
[01:11.560 --> 01:16.880]  His latest art project is a beacon for hysterical anti-Trump millennials to rhythmically chant
[01:16.880 --> 01:20.640]  like cult members.
[01:20.640 --> 01:25.760]  The performance art isn't about opposition to Trump, LeBeouf told the Associated Press.
[01:25.760 --> 01:31.920]  No, this is about rejecting division and uniting people under a peaceful and tolerant message.
[01:31.920 --> 01:37.160]  Right, that'll be why Shia has spent the last week aggressively screaming in the face of
[01:37.160 --> 01:40.360]  anyone who makes fun of his shitty art project.
[01:40.360 --> 01:42.360]  He will not divide us!
[01:42.360 --> 01:44.360]  He will not divide us!
[01:44.360 --> 01:46.360]  He will not divide us!
[01:46.360 --> 01:48.360]  He will not divide us!
[01:48.360 --> 01:51.360]  He will not divide us!
[01:51.360 --> 01:54.280]  Culminating in his arrest for violently assaulting someone.
[01:54.280 --> 01:56.080]  Oh, but that was just a neo-nazi.
[01:56.080 --> 01:57.480]  How dare you defend him?
[01:57.480 --> 02:00.880]  Oh, it was actually one of Shia's own supporters.
[02:00.880 --> 02:04.080]  You're saying you're not the buyers who are between a mantra to each other.
[02:04.080 --> 02:05.680]  I'm still there to show solidarity.
[02:05.680 --> 02:07.680]  Right, so forget the Trump supporters.
[02:07.680 --> 02:09.480]  Forget the 4-chan trolls.
[02:09.480 --> 02:15.480]  Shia actually succeeded in creating division amongst his own fans.
[02:15.480 --> 02:21.280]  Shia, preaching against hatred, intolerance and division is a pretty tough sell.
[02:21.280 --> 02:25.280]  When you're the physical embodiment of hatred, intolerance and division.
[02:25.280 --> 02:27.280]  He will not divide us!
[02:27.280 --> 02:29.280]  He will not divide us!
[02:29.280 --> 02:31.280]  He will not divide us!
[02:31.280 --> 02:39.280]  But it's not really surprising, given that Laboff seems to have a habit of getting arrested for assaulting people all over the world.
[02:39.280 --> 02:42.280]  Look at how USA Today reported this.
[02:42.280 --> 02:46.280]  Was Shia Laboff's arrest triggered by anti-semitic trolling?
[02:46.280 --> 02:50.280]  No, that was a completely separate incident that happened two days before.
[02:50.280 --> 02:53.280]  He was arrested for assaulting his own supporter.
[02:53.280 --> 02:56.280]  Dude, if you all try Shia one more time, he's a Jewish man.
[02:56.280 --> 02:58.280]  That guy just praised Hitler.
[02:58.280 --> 03:00.280]  All Shia did was push him away.
[03:00.280 --> 03:02.280]  I do worse. The f**k!
[03:02.280 --> 03:07.280]  First off, stick to vacuous Instagram selfies because when it comes to politics,
[03:07.280 --> 03:08.280]  You're a basic bench.
[03:08.280 --> 03:13.280]  Secondly, no you can't violently attack people because they make Hitler jokes.
[03:13.280 --> 03:19.280]  Did the Charlie Hebdo cartoonists deserve to be slaughtered because they made jokes about Islam?
[03:19.280 --> 03:24.280]  Do I go around punching communists in the face if I get offended over a hammer and sickle?
[03:24.280 --> 03:30.280]  No, because if they don't have a right to free speech, no matter how offensive, then neither do I.
[03:30.280 --> 03:32.280]  That's how it works, dummy.
[03:32.280 --> 03:36.280]  Violently attacking people to advance a political agenda is called terrorism.
[03:36.280 --> 03:40.280]  The fact that I even have to explain this is depressing.
[03:40.280 --> 03:47.280]  Listen Shia, stop dressing like a homeless person in a lame attempt to appear like an authentic artist.
[03:47.280 --> 03:54.280]  You're not Shea Guevara, you're a privileged multi-millionaire Hollywood celebrity on yet another ego trip.
[03:54.280 --> 03:59.280]  Shia LaBeouf is a rich white liberal who doesn't care about the working class.
[03:59.280 --> 04:04.280]  I actually liked some of your previous art projects about the hysteria surrounding the cult of celebrity.
[04:04.280 --> 04:07.280]  But with this, he will not divide as crap.
[04:07.280 --> 04:13.280]  You're jumping on the anti-Trump hysteria bandwagon created by the establishment media.
[04:13.280 --> 04:19.280]  It's not original, it's not alternative, it's not avant-garde, it's not daring.
[04:19.280 --> 04:22.280]  It's the ultimate example of conformity.
[04:22.280 --> 04:30.280]  You will not divide!
[04:30.280 --> 04:49.280]  It's dumb virtue signalling, and it's only had the effect of creating more division.
[04:49.280 --> 05:00.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Friday the 27th day of January 2017.
[05:19.280 --> 05:23.280]  Living in the United States voted in the 2016 presidential election.
[05:23.280 --> 05:29.280]  The way he sees it, this added 843,000 votes for Clinton, 81% of the non-citizen vote.
[05:29.280 --> 05:34.280]  So there it is again, voter fraud proven to be happening, another independent study has found,
[05:34.280 --> 05:39.280]  stacked that up with independent CBS investigation, the Federalist John Gibbs investigation,
[05:39.280 --> 05:45.280]  a compilation of documented voter fraud at DiscoverTheNetworks.org, and more to come I'm sure.
[05:45.280 --> 05:53.280]  Just yesterday, CNN, USA Today, and other mainstream media outlets claimed Trump's claim of voter fraud was debunked.
[05:53.280 --> 06:16.280]  This is Alex Jones. I want to tell you about a way to save a lot of money on one of the best new Off the Grid products of 2017.

[07:07.280 --> 07:23.280]  Thanks for watching this video.
[07:37.280 --> 07:52.280]  Thanks for watching this video. Thanks for watching this video.
[07:52.280 --> 08:07.280]  Thanks for watching this video. Thanks for watching this video.
[08:22.280 --> 08:41.280]  Thanks for watching this video. Thanks for watching this video.
[08:41.280 --> 08:54.280]  Well, this is a another broadcast that no one's going to want to miss or need to miss. This doesn't happen very often, but when it does, I basically need to just get off the radio right now and not even be here.
[08:54.280 --> 09:04.280]  Because I need to go into preparing a special report that will completely devastate the globalist.
[09:04.280 --> 09:12.280]  Folks know I don't talk like that unless something is devastating, devastating.
[09:12.280 --> 09:31.280]  Because they've bet everything in the first week of the presidency on saying Trump's a liar, and the underlying foundation of that is he's lying saying that 3 million illegals swung the popular vote for Hillary,
[09:31.280 --> 09:45.280]  and Trump says it's in the studies. Well, we research every day, and so I did find a few studies that backed up his claim, but it was a margin of 4 million up to 20 million.
[09:45.280 --> 09:53.280]  But you couldn't quantify actually how many of those were actually fraud, or how many of those were actually voting.
[09:53.280 --> 10:07.280]  And then of course there's electoral college where they admit illegals, get more congresspeople for those states just off the census, and so that swings.
[10:07.280 --> 10:24.280]  But we found other studies that no one has covered, and that have gotten no attention by prestigious universities and political science departments that find exactly what Donald Trump said.
[10:24.280 --> 10:38.280]  Now I'm starting to figure him out, he baits them, he puts stuff out, knowing it's the truth, but just him saying it, lets them lie about him, and then lets the truth come out.
[10:38.280 --> 10:47.280]  It's crazy. It's exactly what Trump said. By the way, he went with a low number. You have the electoral college numbers.
[10:47.280 --> 10:57.280]  We're talking about in the last decade more than 10 million people in key demographic states like Florida, California, it's more than 10 million, and New York,
[10:57.280 --> 11:10.280]  most of them illegal into the electoral college so that those states that have higher populations get apportioned more House members.
[11:10.280 --> 11:19.280]  And so that right there gives the Democratic Party more votes in Congress and more control and more funding.
[11:19.280 --> 11:23.280]  So you start looking at it, Trump's given us a low number.
[11:23.280 --> 11:36.280]  And then while I'm busy last night and this morning with Rob Do, breaking out and sweats this information is so powerful I'm going to break down at the bottom of the hour that Rob's in there working on a special report.
[11:36.280 --> 11:56.280]  And so as McBrain, I go to drudgereport.com and there's this big old enchilada, Washington Times, Trump argument bolstered, Clinton received 800,000 votes from noncitizens, another study found.
[11:56.280 --> 12:06.280]  And they were looking at different data in a different area. Everybody knows the Democrats said their battle plan to win was to get illegal to vote. Hell, that's in Bloomberg. I've got that right here.
[12:06.280 --> 12:13.280]  That's what's so frustrating. Everybody knows that.
[12:13.280 --> 12:18.280]  And then they try to get illegals to be able to vote in all these states and they try to get rid of ID laws.
[12:18.280 --> 12:30.280]  So we know that's their plan and they tell us no, Obamacare is free. No, Hillary's going to win the election. No, two plus two equals five. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[12:30.280 --> 12:37.280]  But the truth is I'm trying to do the math and I've got statisticians that are about to look into it breaking all this different data together.
[12:37.280 --> 12:52.280]  It looks like eight million dead people and illegals voted in the last election. If you add population growth to the 2012, because it was about seven million voting illegally then.
[12:52.280 --> 13:01.280]  So maybe eight, nine, 10 million now, like double triple what Trump says. You cannot make this stuff up. No wonder they're so scared of it going.
[13:01.280 --> 13:12.280]  Everyone knows no illegals are voting. Everyone knows no one's voting with dead people's names. Everyone knows the moon is made of cheese, delicious Swiss cheese.
[13:12.280 --> 13:17.280]  Everybody knows that Hillary Clinton is in great physical shape. Why she's in the best shape of any woman ever.
[13:17.280 --> 13:27.280]  Why she could climb Mount Everest in a single bound faster than a speeding bullet or powerful than a locomotive.
[13:27.280 --> 13:33.280]  She can leap over her lesbian girlfriends in a single bound.
[13:33.280 --> 13:42.280]  So that's all coming up. But first I'm going to hit you with a special report while I catch my breath because my heart's going boom, boom, boom, boom, because I've got it all right here.
[13:42.280 --> 13:49.280]  And I want to present it and roll it out for you. Maybe I should wait till the middle of the next hour. I've got another guest scheduled to come up.
[13:49.280 --> 13:57.280]  I just almost want to have a guest host coming here and just cover the show while I just try to go through all this because I've got it all here. But I want to get some math numbers on this.
[13:57.280 --> 14:03.280]  I mean, this is just, it totally proves what Trump's been saying. I'm going to give you the studies, all of it.
[14:03.280 --> 14:10.280]  But let's go ahead and go to a special report that's up on infowars.com that is so important to get out to everybody.
[14:10.280 --> 14:17.280]  Emergency alert. Communist Chinese now taking over US media and attacking President Trump. This is unprecedented.
[14:17.280 --> 14:27.280]  Here is this emergency red link report on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. This will bring them down if you put this out as well.
[14:27.280 --> 14:31.280]  It's been said the truth is stranger than fiction. And now it's coming true.
[14:31.280 --> 14:43.280]  In just the last few weeks, Communist China has openly sent their president to the Davos Forum and called for China to run a world government that blocks the United States recovery and that stops President Trump.
[14:43.280 --> 14:50.280]  And now they're even advising the MSM on how to censor the independent press in this country, but it gets even worse.
[14:50.280 --> 15:03.280]  The Communist Chinese government is now buying up the major Hollywood studios and openly producing movies where President Trump is a dictator and needs to be overthrown.
[15:03.280 --> 15:14.280]  In the last decade, China has been producing more and more of its films to be palatable to the Communist Chinese.
[15:14.280 --> 15:22.280]  In fact, the unelected Communist dictatorship has been dictating how films are actually produced and how they're edited.
[15:22.280 --> 15:33.280]  They've been even controlling the plots of films and demanding that movies like Red Dawn, the remake, not be released because it criticized China.
[15:33.280 --> 15:42.280]  They had to go back and cut China out and re-release it. So this problem has been getting worse and worse over the years, but now it's gone to a whole new level.
[15:42.280 --> 15:54.280]  In the last few months, it's been reported that Communist China-backed billionaires have been buying up controlling interest in the major six production studios in Hollywood.
[15:54.280 --> 16:05.280]  Now, Hollywood has been very anti-family, very anti-gun, very anti-American for a very, very long time, but now with the Communist Chinese and a foreign power,
[16:05.280 --> 16:13.280]  getting a controlling interest in major studios, we are looking at a clear and present danger to the very sovereignty of our country.
[16:13.280 --> 16:23.280]  Mr. President, you have been falsely accused. I've been accused. Former Congressman Ron Paul has been accused and many others of being secret Russian agents.
[16:23.280 --> 16:30.280]  Maxine Waters even claimed that Putin told you in your ear that Hillary was crooked.
[16:30.280 --> 16:38.280]  If they're the ones who came up with crooked Hillary, if they're the ones who came up with she's ill, something's wrong with her energy,
[16:38.280 --> 16:51.280]  and the way that he basically described her in the campaign, I think that is something that would put the question squarely on the table whether or not he should be impeached.
[16:51.280 --> 17:03.280]  Of course, all of that now has been debunked as completely false, but the real threat, the outside power, is Communist China coming in and taking control of Hollywood
[17:03.280 --> 17:09.280]  and a lot of news media as well in the United States with tens of billions of dollars they're spending.
[17:09.280 --> 17:13.280]  You've talked about monopolies being threats inside the United States.
[17:13.280 --> 17:21.280]  What about the Communist Chinese having monopoly over Hollywood and the news and information we see coming out of corporate fake news?
[17:21.280 --> 17:37.280]  It was already unreal to witness the Communist Chinese government, including their president, being interviewed by major U.S. newspapers lecturing us on how media that supported Trump was fake news and should be shut down.
[17:37.280 --> 17:49.280]  These were foreign powers openly coming in and getting involved in our election process while the very same trader media was claiming the Russians were the ones behind Trump's support.
[17:49.280 --> 17:54.280]  It's just crazy. They do in public everything they claim that we're doing.
[17:54.280 --> 18:01.280]  And now we see what the Communist Chinese are doing with their takeover of Hollywood that is almost totally complete.
[18:01.280 --> 18:15.280]  They are producing blockbuster films with hundred plus million dollar budgets produced by people like Michael Bay and directed by him where Donald Trump is a dictator villain that must be overthrown.
[18:15.280 --> 18:30.280]  In the film, a U.S. soldier is hired by a loving Communist Chinese billionaire to go in and get his family out from the tyrannical United States and to lead the American people in an uprising against little America.
[18:30.280 --> 18:37.280]  That's right. Hollywood's producing films telling us that America is little under President Trump.
[18:37.280 --> 18:42.280]  No country has ever survived such treason if it's not answered.
[18:42.280 --> 18:50.280]  No country has ever put up with foreign outside powers coming in and taking over their media and their theater systems.
[18:50.280 --> 18:55.280]  That is the heart of any informational or propaganda system.
[18:55.280 --> 19:04.280]  This is truly an information warfare coup that the Communist Chinese with their globalist and liberal cohorts are attempting.
[19:04.280 --> 19:24.280]  Mr. President, it is not just your right. It is your duty to call out Communist China for what they're doing and to tell Hollywood that the American people are not going to sit on the sidelines while they engage in this demoralizing anti-free speech takeover.
[19:24.280 --> 19:29.280]  Because the Communist Chinese are an outside power and they say we shouldn't have speech.
[19:29.280 --> 19:37.280]  Well, they sure don't have a right to come in as a foreign power and buy up our media and then propagandize us domestically.
[19:37.280 --> 19:41.280]  Mr. President, I know you have the power to shut down this foreign takeover cold.
[19:41.280 --> 19:54.280]  But the press would claim you were violating the free speech of the Communist Chinese who don't let their own people have free speech and who execute Falun Gong Buddhist for basically practicing yoga in their own homes.
[19:54.280 --> 20:06.280]  I think personally the best thing to do is to use your bully pulpit to expose this tyranny and to point out they're doing everything they claimed that the Russians did in the election.
[20:06.280 --> 20:19.280]  But regardless of what you do, Mr. President, the American people need to take action and boycott these Hollywood production houses that are engaged in attempts to cause a civil war in this country.
[20:19.280 --> 20:25.280]  To be clear, the Communist Chinese have almost completely taken over Hollywood illegally.
[20:25.280 --> 20:31.280]  This is a massively traitorous move by Obama allowing this to happen.
[20:31.280 --> 20:41.280]  And now they are producing not just this film but other films that all portray President Trump as a loser that causes the downfall of our country.
[20:41.280 --> 20:49.280]  These people want us to fail. They want to kill the Republic forever. They want to discredit the idea of a free, open society.
[20:49.280 --> 20:56.280]  And we've got to stand up against it and speak out against it. I know they've jumped the shark. They've really stepped in it here.
[20:56.280 --> 21:06.280]  If we stand up and point out that they think we're so brain dead, they think we're such zombies that they would attempt to put out movies like this.
[21:06.280 --> 21:09.280]  It's so sad to see how far Hollywood's fallen.
[21:09.280 --> 21:24.280]  They are so desperate to dominate this country that even at the Davos Forum we see the Communist Chinese, unelected president promising the globalists that he'll be able to bully America into submission and that he'll be able to complete their world government.
[21:24.280 --> 21:31.280]  When China is tottering on the edge of collapse, enclosing President Trump deserves all our prayers.
[21:31.280 --> 21:40.280]  We've got the Washington Post calling him Hitler for the stock market gaining $2 trillion on exuberance and optimism and calls for tax cuts and cutting regulations.
[21:40.280 --> 21:46.280]  We've got Madonna calling for the White House to be blown up. We've got thousands of other publications calling for similar things.
[21:46.280 --> 21:51.280]  And he's got the courage and the will to stand up against this tyranny and be so strong.
[21:51.280 --> 22:00.280]  And I'm asking Mr. President to call out the Communist Chinese for oppressing their own people and attempting to bully you and the rest of us into submission.
[22:00.280 --> 22:03.280]  I'm Alex Jones and this is the Info War.
[22:08.280 --> 22:17.280]  Alright folks, there is so much to cover obviously here. After the next break, I'm going to go into new evidence that's actually old evidence backing up Trump's claim.
[22:17.280 --> 22:31.280]  And there's other studies that have now been recently done by major universities in Virginia just in the last few months since the election showing the similar trend of illegals voting.
[22:31.280 --> 22:36.280]  We know illegals are voting, but they look at us and tell us no illegals are voting. That's crazy.
[22:36.280 --> 22:48.280]  By the New York Times said so, even as the Democrats pass laws in their states that get killed by governors that are illegal to let illegals vote. This is crazy.
[22:48.280 --> 22:55.280]  Trump embraces conspiracy theory to promote illegal vote claim.
[22:55.280 --> 23:02.280]  And they're all over CNN, they're all over the New York Times saying he learned this from Alex Jones.
[23:02.280 --> 23:08.280]  As if that does credits Trump saying I'm the only place where this is being reported.
[23:08.280 --> 23:14.280]  And then you go to Paul Watson's article from last year, it's Pew Research, it's other university studies.
[23:14.280 --> 23:17.280]  And now we just went and found a bunch of others last night.
[23:17.280 --> 23:23.280]  And separately, the Washington Times found another one and published today.
[23:23.280 --> 23:29.280]  So what's happening is everybody's digging now that the president's called for investigation and it's proving everything he said more.
[23:29.280 --> 23:32.280]  But that's coming up in the next segment.
[23:32.280 --> 23:41.280]  Separately, they're engaging in all this, a new deception where they take things I'll say in a Facebook mentions are out of a four hour radio show and go look, Jones is lying.
[23:41.280 --> 23:46.280]  He says he's been given White House press credentials, but they haven't issued press credentials yet.
[23:46.280 --> 23:49.280]  And the White House says they haven't issued him to Jones.
[23:49.280 --> 23:53.280]  And you go back to what I said, it's I don't even know if I want to go to DC or have a bureau there.
[23:53.280 --> 24:00.280]  It costs so much money and, you know, we don't want to be really part of DC, but now that Trump's there, it'd be good to be able to cover what the enemy media is doing.
[24:00.280 --> 24:11.280]  And I've been contacted by people that have credentials previously and who've been in Washington bureaus who are very prominent household names, the media who want to work with us.
[24:11.280 --> 24:17.280]  And I've been contacted by a lot of other people that'll be announced very, very soon.
[24:17.280 --> 24:23.280]  It's just if it depends whether I want full time people there or part time, but we're looking at it. Okay.
[24:23.280 --> 24:31.280]  And obviously, yes, people involved with the Trump operation have said, Wow, we'd love Watson to be here.
[24:31.280 --> 24:35.280]  It was he going to come? It's like, Hey, when are you coming?
[24:35.280 --> 24:41.280]  And I say, Yeah, we're going to get our credentials turns into Jones is a big liar. He's not media. He's not allowed to go.
[24:41.280 --> 24:44.280]  He's not allowed to be there. You know what? That's it.
[24:44.280 --> 24:52.280]  I made the decision this morning just because of MSM that we're going to go ahead and probably just set up a whole bureau in DC and just totally dominate.
[24:52.280 --> 25:02.280]  How's that sound? This is what you want. This is what you get. You say we're liars. You say we can't do this. Just watch who we have working for us in our DC bureau.
[25:02.280 --> 25:09.280]  Just watch and just wait. I'm going to leave it at that right now.
[25:09.280 --> 25:16.280]  But it's just so much fun to rub these liars noses in it.
[25:16.280 --> 25:27.280]  Now separately, Trump is completely delivering a dizzying pace of CNN says he's obsessed or it borders on obsession doing what he said he do.
[25:27.280 --> 25:33.280]  As his Gallup poll goes up and up and up and listen to this quote of Trump.
[25:33.280 --> 25:41.280]  He says think of everything we can achieve and remember who we must achieve it for. Trump told Republican lawmakers Thursday in Philadelphia.
[25:41.280 --> 25:43.280]  Now we have to deliver.
[25:43.280 --> 25:48.280]  Enough all talk no action we have to deliver.
[25:48.280 --> 26:03.280]  Then they act like it's a bad thing. He got rid of the transparent specific partnership that we work secretly to get through over the years. He's building the border wall. He's moving to cut the taxes. He's signing all these executive orders to stop harassing coal plants to get cheaper energy.
[26:03.280 --> 26:06.280]  It's terrible. What are we going to do?
[26:06.280 --> 26:09.280]  And their answer is sabotage.
[26:09.280 --> 26:17.280]  But coming up while other outlets fact check Trump's info wars provides alternative facts.
[26:17.280 --> 26:38.280]  That's right. They've got articles out that we provided the alternative facts from CNN's gigapixel photo from the Dias showing the entire mall filled past capacity with overflow and showed CNN running a clip of when the gates first opened saying that was the full crowd.
[26:38.280 --> 26:40.280]  Yes, that's our alternate facts.
[26:40.280 --> 26:55.280]  No, you are in an alternate reality called deceptionville. We're in reality based journalism, which is just common sense. So get used to it and freak out all you want and try to define us as not real.
[26:55.280 --> 27:09.280]  You've defined yourself as a pack of liars with Don Lemon running around yesterday saying I don't like to call Trump a liar, but he's just a liar about the 3 million illegals in the election.
[27:09.280 --> 27:24.280]  Really? Well, we have studies showing just that on the other side of this break. But before I go any further, I want to announce one of the biggest sales we've done in a year, specifically on two items.

[30:19.280 --> 30:37.280]  So there it is again voter fraud proven to be happening. Another independent study has found stacked that up with independent CBS investigation.
[30:37.280 --> 30:53.280]  The Federalist John Gibbs investigation, a compilation of documented voter fraud at discover the networks.org and more to come. I'm sure. Remember just yesterday, CNN, USA Today and other mainstream media outlets claim Trump's claim of voter fraud was debunked.
[30:53.280 --> 31:08.280]  Even fact check.org said it wasn't true. This is Owen shroyer for info wars.com. Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here host of the bright side. And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[31:08.280 --> 31:23.280]  I've all heard the shocking statistics. Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge.
[31:23.280 --> 31:36.280]  And everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day to day lives,

[33:00.280 --> 33:17.280]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[33:17.280 --> 33:24.280]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:24.280 --> 33:34.280]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. Thank you for joining us.
[33:34.280 --> 33:42.280]  And of course, the vice president for the first time ever just spoke to the big yearly pro life March in D.C.
[33:42.280 --> 33:54.280]  When Trump did the ABC news interview a few days ago, and he brought up the fact that he was going to be supporting the March for Life, the reporters mouth hung open.
[33:54.280 --> 34:07.280]  Because if you say we're against shipping TB and leprosy into the country, you go to make the audience watching think that's a bad thing or the vice president's going to keep his promise and go speak to a major pro life group.
[34:07.280 --> 34:14.280]  And we're not going to let, you know, the public schools teach kids how to be sexually active when they're in the first grade.
[34:14.280 --> 34:17.280]  And we're not going to leave the borders wide open.
[34:17.280 --> 34:20.280]  And we're not going to let foreign governments buy up our media.
[34:20.280 --> 34:23.280]  And we're not going to have unfair trade deals.
[34:23.280 --> 34:30.280]  Again, it's all body language signaling to the viewers that this is a kook.
[34:30.280 --> 34:34.280]  But the mainstream media are the ones that are discredited.
[34:34.280 --> 34:37.280]  They are the ones that have been exposed.
[34:37.280 --> 34:43.280]  Meanwhile, you now have the special relationship back with the UK and you have the British prime minister visiting.
[34:43.280 --> 34:45.280]  So this is a blitzkrieg.
[34:45.280 --> 34:52.280]  He is now less than seven days out from when he got inaugurated.
[34:52.280 --> 34:56.280]  And in a few hours, it'll be seven days and it's already changed the US.
[34:56.280 --> 34:58.280]  It's already changed the world.
[34:58.280 --> 35:06.280]  It is amazing the creative destruction we're seeing as they begin to remove this treacherous bureaucracy that is now fighting for its life.
[35:06.280 --> 35:11.280]  The problem is it wanted to bring down what was left of America to secure its dominance.
[35:11.280 --> 35:13.280]  It had to be defeated.
[35:13.280 --> 35:16.280]  And in the eleventh hour, it began to happen.
[35:16.280 --> 35:21.280]  The problem is they're planning on plunging the world economy from Ron Paul to Mr. Dent.
[35:21.280 --> 35:24.280]  They all agree that we're in serious trouble.
[35:24.280 --> 35:29.280]  They are trying to now cut the QE3 to stall Trump's recovery.
[35:29.280 --> 35:32.280]  If they just gave him six months a year longer, it'd be assured.
[35:32.280 --> 35:35.280]  But they're stalling it right underneath his feet.
[35:35.280 --> 35:43.280]  That's why he is accelerating as fast as he can to try to change this.
[35:43.280 --> 35:49.280]  So they're saying it's bad, but we know it's good and it's what we ask for.
[35:49.280 --> 35:56.280]  Now, before I go any further, I want to play a clip and then come back with the election news proving Trump was right.
[35:56.280 --> 36:01.280]  How Donald Trump changed the presidency in seven days from CNN.
[36:01.280 --> 36:05.280]  We're going to play that here in just a moment.
[36:05.280 --> 36:07.280]  Here it is.
[36:07.280 --> 36:19.280]  A new world order, presidential decrees cascading from President Trump's pen. A border wall with Mexico kicking off the world's first leadership Twitter spat.
[36:19.280 --> 36:24.280]  Mexico's president announcing on a video they won't pay.
[36:24.280 --> 36:30.280]  Trump firing back on Twitter that it would be better to cancel the upcoming meeting.
[36:30.280 --> 36:37.280]  President Pininietto tweets back, I will not attend the meeting scheduled for next Tuesday with the POTUS.
[36:37.280 --> 36:42.280]  Another decree cutting the Trans-Pacific Partnership adrift.
[36:42.280 --> 36:48.280]  The other 11 member nations and the rest of the world now figuring out what it means for them.
[36:48.280 --> 36:52.280]  We must not underestimate what he has in store.
[36:52.280 --> 36:55.280]  He will lead a protectionist nationalistic program.
[36:55.280 --> 36:59.280]  NAFTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement, could be next.
[36:59.280 --> 37:02.280]  And tighter immigration controls for some Muslims.
[37:02.280 --> 37:07.280]  Then Israel, total defrost of that White House relationship.
[37:07.280 --> 37:11.280]  Already Israel announcing plans to expand settlements.
[37:11.280 --> 37:15.280]  America's regional allies scrambling to respond.
[37:15.280 --> 37:21.280]  President Trump making good on some of candidate Trump's promises.
[37:21.280 --> 37:26.280]  I think areas in the South China Sea that are part of international waters and international activities.
[37:26.280 --> 37:28.280]  I think the US is going to make sure that we protect our interests there.
[37:28.280 --> 37:33.280]  His spokesman tough on China, drawing swift Chinese condemnation.
[37:33.280 --> 37:37.280]  The United States is not a party to the South China Sea issue.
[37:37.280 --> 37:41.280]  We urge the United States to honour its commitments.
[37:41.280 --> 37:47.280]  Amidst all this controversy, the first world leader to visit President Trump.
[37:47.280 --> 37:53.280]  Time and again, it is the relationship between us that has defined the modern world.
[37:53.280 --> 38:00.280]  Prime Minister Theresa May trading on historic US-UK bonds to boost business between the two nations.
[38:00.280 --> 38:04.280]  But pushed off message by Trump's latest comments.
[38:04.280 --> 38:09.280]  Torture may be okay. Defending herself before she left the UK.
[38:09.280 --> 38:13.280]  We have a very clear position on torture. We do not sanction torture.
[38:13.280 --> 38:16.280]  We do not get involved with that and that will continue to be our position.
[38:16.280 --> 38:21.280]  The British leader also facing European pushback on her visit.
[38:21.280 --> 38:26.280]  Concerns Trump is using Britain to divide Europe.
[38:26.280 --> 38:32.280]  No, what Trump is doing is exposing the globalist.
[38:32.280 --> 38:37.280]  What Trump is doing is pointing out this multinational corporate takeover operation
[38:37.280 --> 38:46.280]  that is going into the nation states and setting up political systems to indent the populations.
[38:46.280 --> 38:53.280]  Now, let's get into the big news.
[38:53.280 --> 38:58.280]  The New York Times, CNN, every other major corporate establishment publication
[38:58.280 --> 39:02.280]  has come out and said that Donald Trump is a liar.
[39:02.280 --> 39:07.280]  And the first clip I'm going to play in a moment is Don Lemon of CNN yesterday
[39:07.280 --> 39:09.280]  saying he doesn't want to call Trump a liar, but he is.
[39:09.280 --> 39:16.280]  This is the same CNN that lied about WMDs, the same CNN that got caught lying about Obamacare
[39:16.280 --> 39:18.280]  saying it was free or there were no death panels.
[39:18.280 --> 39:22.280]  The same CNN that got caught lying about the polls with Hillary
[39:22.280 --> 39:25.280]  and got caught colluding with her, giving her the questions beforehand.
[39:25.280 --> 39:30.280]  The same CNN that is completely and totally discredited and is a giant
[39:30.280 --> 39:37.280]  to use Trump's term, pile of garbage, pile of deception.
[39:37.280 --> 39:41.280]  And there are literally hundreds of publications out today saying that
[39:41.280 --> 39:49.280]  Trump gets his information from Info Wars concerning the three million illegals voting.
[39:49.280 --> 39:53.280]  That does two things. It implies that we're bad information
[39:53.280 --> 39:57.280]  and it also implies that Trump's bad because he got his information from a bad place.
[39:57.280 --> 40:01.280]  No, Info Wars has reported what Pew Research has shown
[40:01.280 --> 40:04.280]  that millions more may have voted
[40:04.280 --> 40:09.280]  and that tens of millions of quote dead people may be having their identities used.
[40:09.280 --> 40:15.280]  We have other studies showing upwards of three million that have voted in past elections.
[40:15.280 --> 40:20.280]  We have giant public Democratic Party programs to get illegals registered,
[40:20.280 --> 40:27.280]  to not have them use IDs, and to pass laws in states that have been killed only by governors.
[40:27.280 --> 40:30.280]  It's gotten all the way to governors to legalize quote immigrants voting.
[40:30.280 --> 40:34.280]  And some cities like San Francisco say they do it regardless and let you vote.
[40:34.280 --> 40:37.280]  So organized, racketeering fraud is going on.
[40:37.280 --> 40:41.280]  You have this wall of disinfo, including on Fox News, saying,
[40:41.280 --> 40:44.280]  well, Trump's right, there are a bunch of illegals that could vote.
[40:44.280 --> 40:49.280]  There are dead people who have been taken off the rolls, but there's no proof.
[40:49.280 --> 40:51.280]  Now, that's Fox Regular.
[40:51.280 --> 40:54.280]  Fox Business has told the truth and shown the Pew Research.
[40:54.280 --> 40:59.280]  We're going to play some of that, but here's the new news today.
[40:59.280 --> 41:06.280]  We found this a few days ago, major university studies, two different ones,
[41:06.280 --> 41:10.280]  towards Washington and, of course, Old Dominion,
[41:10.280 --> 41:15.280]  and we're building a special report that was going to air today on this.
[41:15.280 --> 41:19.280]  Separately, one of the same universities, Old Dominion,
[41:19.280 --> 41:25.280]  came out in the Washington Times today and has already looked in the last two months at this election
[41:25.280 --> 41:31.280]  and found massive numbers in a limited sample, 800,000 illegals voting,
[41:31.280 --> 41:35.280]  and that's not even a complete sample of the whole country.
[41:35.280 --> 41:42.280]  So the new news is we have found two university studies finding 2.8 million or more,
[41:42.280 --> 41:46.280]  depending on how you look at the demographics, voting in a previous election,
[41:46.280 --> 41:49.280]  and with demographics of illegals going up, it shows even higher,
[41:49.280 --> 41:53.280]  showing his number of 3 million to be low, but it gets more insane.
[41:53.280 --> 41:57.280]  I'm giving you a synopsis of where I'll show all the facts.
[41:57.280 --> 42:03.280]  The Democrats have bragged in internal fundraising letters in 2008, in 2012,
[42:03.280 --> 42:11.280]  and publicly in Politico and Bloomberg, and I have them saying our secret weapon is illegals.
[42:11.280 --> 42:19.280]  Our secret weapon is illegals to vote, but also to be in the census
[42:19.280 --> 42:24.280]  so that those Democrat states get more House members,
[42:24.280 --> 42:28.280]  and then that means a higher number in the Electoral College,
[42:28.280 --> 42:32.280]  meaning a higher vote tally in the election.
[42:32.280 --> 42:40.280]  And the number it appears, conservatively, is between 7 and 10 million,
[42:40.280 --> 42:48.280]  added to the Electoral College, which shows Trump conservatively.
[42:48.280 --> 42:52.280]  At 10 million illegals and dead people voting.
[42:52.280 --> 42:55.280]  By the way, that's not even counting the dead people,
[42:55.280 --> 42:59.280]  because you've got Democrats with a big list going out who are citizens voting repeatedly.
[42:59.280 --> 43:01.280]  They also use illegals, poor people, you name it.
[43:01.280 --> 43:04.280]  So Trump keeps focusing on the illegals.
[43:04.280 --> 43:10.280]  And again, I've been poring over this for months, well years, but really for months on it every day.
[43:10.280 --> 43:14.280]  Most studies show that the illegal voting, the voter fraud,
[43:14.280 --> 43:17.280]  but again, it's election fraud because it's organized on top, it's both,
[43:17.280 --> 43:21.280]  is probably double citizens going around doing it.
[43:21.280 --> 43:25.280]  They've actually had trouble getting illegals to go out and engage in fraud,
[43:25.280 --> 43:28.280]  because let's face it, the average illegal from wherever they come from
[43:28.280 --> 43:31.280]  doesn't want to get picked up, doesn't want to be arrested, wants to lay low.
[43:31.280 --> 43:34.280]  So they're trying to get illegals to go out and vote.
[43:34.280 --> 43:37.280]  That's why they're trying to get laws passed so they'll go do it.
[43:37.280 --> 43:41.280]  They're like, no, Senor, no, no, no, no.
[43:41.280 --> 43:47.280]  But you get these Democrats, mainly white, urban, and city voters,
[43:47.280 --> 43:50.280]  and they will go engage in fraud all day long.
[43:50.280 --> 43:51.280]  And I'm just telling you, who does it?
[43:51.280 --> 43:54.280]  Just like that million woman march, there's probably a million, I was there.
[43:54.280 --> 43:57.280]  Not going to lie like they do and say nobody was at the Trump deal or nobody was at theirs.
[43:57.280 --> 43:59.280]  It was huge. I was there.
[43:59.280 --> 44:02.280]  And it was almost all white women.
[44:02.280 --> 44:05.280]  That's the demographic that just, they have a chip on their shoulder.
[44:05.280 --> 44:08.280]  They have this weird guilt complex, so they go to the other extreme
[44:08.280 --> 44:12.280]  and they're screaming, you're an effing white male, you're the problem, I hope you die.
[44:12.280 --> 44:15.280]  I mean, they are ready to do anything.
[44:15.280 --> 44:17.280]  They were putting hot jibs on.
[44:17.280 --> 44:21.280]  The group running it, it now is connected to torture and murder of people
[44:21.280 --> 44:23.280]  and genital mutilation.
[44:23.280 --> 44:26.280]  They were out handing out jibs that were American flags in front of me.
[44:26.280 --> 44:29.280]  I didn't know it was a national movement or that was who was running it.
[44:29.280 --> 44:34.280]  And the police were wearing the weird hats and not stopping them from beating people up.
[44:34.280 --> 44:38.280]  I mean, it was just crazy.
[44:38.280 --> 44:41.280]  So Trump needs to clean out who's been put in charge there in D.C.
[44:41.280 --> 44:47.280]  But going back to the facts, because you can't make this up,
[44:47.280 --> 44:50.280]  this is just so massive.
[44:50.280 --> 44:54.280]  This is so massive that when you add the electoral college,
[44:54.280 --> 44:57.280]  because again, the illegals get picked up by the census,
[44:57.280 --> 45:02.280]  that then gets added as a portionment in the house for members of the house.
[45:02.280 --> 45:04.280]  That's what California has the most house members.
[45:04.280 --> 45:06.280]  Texas second.
[45:06.280 --> 45:08.280]  Then it goes what, New York, Florida.
[45:08.280 --> 45:10.280]  Think about that.
[45:10.280 --> 45:14.280]  And then when you vote in that state, that then,
[45:14.280 --> 45:19.280]  your vote counts more because of the apportionment under the electoral college.
[45:19.280 --> 45:22.280]  So Trump has been proven right in a whole new way.
[45:22.280 --> 45:24.280]  And then it's not Alex Jones saying it.
[45:24.280 --> 45:27.280]  It's the Democratic Party in their own fundraising memos saying,
[45:27.280 --> 45:29.280]  don't worry, this is our secret weapon.
[45:29.280 --> 45:33.280]  And then you've got Politico, Bloomberg, and the New York Times.
[45:33.280 --> 45:34.280]  I forgot that one.
[45:34.280 --> 45:46.280]  All bragging in 2008, in 2012, in 2014, in midterms, and now in 2016.
[45:46.280 --> 45:49.280]  Whoa.
[45:49.280 --> 45:53.280]  So we're codifying all this with graphs, numbers, the studies, all of it,
[45:53.280 --> 45:54.280]  into a big report.
[45:54.280 --> 45:56.280]  But I'm live here on the radio, breaking this down for a radio audience.
[45:56.280 --> 46:00.280]  Let me now show some proof for everybody who is watching, be infowars.com,
[46:00.280 --> 46:03.280]  forward slash show, and TV, and cable affiliates out there.
[46:03.280 --> 46:05.280]  Document cam please.
[46:05.280 --> 46:06.280]  So here's the Washington Post.
[46:06.280 --> 46:11.280]  Without evidence, Trump tells lawmakers three to five million illegal ballots
[46:11.280 --> 46:13.280]  cost him the popular vote.
[46:13.280 --> 46:15.280]  January 23rd.
[46:15.280 --> 46:19.280]  Now here's CNN last night, New York Times today, while other outlets fact check Trump.
[46:19.280 --> 46:21.280]  Info Wars provides alternative facts.
[46:21.280 --> 46:29.280]  Yes, let me show you the alternative facts to Don Lemon just saying we're liars.
[46:29.280 --> 46:30.280]  Trump is a liar.
[46:30.280 --> 46:31.280]  I'm a liar.
[46:31.280 --> 46:32.280]  We're just liars.
[46:32.280 --> 46:34.280]  Oh, that's a big fancy fact.
[46:34.280 --> 46:36.280]  Oh, look what I have.
[46:36.280 --> 46:44.280]  Oh, I have all these university studies, prestigious political science departments,
[46:44.280 --> 46:49.280]  multiple George Mason University, Old Dominion University, it goes on and on.
[46:49.280 --> 46:51.280]  Oh, I'm about to go over all that for you.
[46:51.280 --> 46:53.280]  Alternative facts.
[46:53.280 --> 46:55.280]  You mean truthful facts.
[46:55.280 --> 46:58.280]  You mean stay up till midnight type facts.
[46:58.280 --> 47:03.280]  And the great part is we're digging up all these studies.
[47:03.280 --> 47:06.280]  And other people have already dug up other ones faster than we can even do it.
[47:06.280 --> 47:09.280]  They're up on drudgerport.com right now.
[47:09.280 --> 47:11.280]  So first let's show Don Lemon.
[47:11.280 --> 47:12.280]  He's arrogant.
[47:12.280 --> 47:14.280]  He's got a nice tie on.
[47:14.280 --> 47:15.280]  He's at CNN.
[47:15.280 --> 47:20.280]  And he just says, oh, it hurts him so bad to say Trump's a liar, but he is.
[47:20.280 --> 47:22.280]  Here is the real liar.
[47:22.280 --> 47:26.280]  I think that in journalism, our role is not to be stenographers.
[47:26.280 --> 47:28.280]  Our role is to be watchdogs.
[47:28.280 --> 47:31.280]  And we have to provide that kind of accountability.
[47:31.280 --> 47:37.280]  And I think when a president or anybody else says something that is verifiably empirically false,
[47:37.280 --> 47:39.280]  then one has to call him out on it.
[47:39.280 --> 47:40.280]  Yeah.
[47:40.280 --> 47:44.280]  It's tough to call the president of the United States a liar because you want to respect the office.
[47:44.280 --> 47:49.280]  But I think it does a disservice to the American people, and even to the president,
[47:49.280 --> 47:52.280]  and even to journalists.
[47:52.280 --> 47:53.280]  Not to call.
[47:53.280 --> 47:56.280]  Call it what it is, and it is a lie.
[47:56.280 --> 47:57.280]  It is a lie.
[47:57.280 --> 47:58.280]  Yes, you are a big, fat liar.
[47:58.280 --> 48:00.280]  And we're going to go over that right now.
[48:00.280 --> 48:03.280]  Now, before I get to all the numbers and the latest studies,
[48:03.280 --> 48:07.280]  let's just give you Pew Research, the top research facility organization in the country,
[48:07.280 --> 48:09.280]  drawing from universities, government, you name it.
[48:09.280 --> 48:13.280]  Their numbers are way bigger of who could potentially do it.
[48:13.280 --> 48:15.280]  But again, the Democrats are organizing us.
[48:15.280 --> 48:16.280]  They're getting caught doing it.
[48:16.280 --> 48:18.280]  They're getting caught voting for dead people.
[48:18.280 --> 48:22.280]  They got caught in the last election, got arrested in like seven different states.
[48:22.280 --> 48:24.280]  But they're just saying it's preposterous.
[48:24.280 --> 48:26.280]  No such thing exists.
[48:26.280 --> 48:28.280]  Just like they said it was preposterous six months ago,
[48:28.280 --> 48:30.280]  no one would ever federalize the election.
[48:30.280 --> 48:33.280]  That's tyranny, which Obama's now done.
[48:33.280 --> 48:40.280]  And all 50 state attorney generals, including Democrats, have said it's tyranny and asked Obama to reverse it.
[48:40.280 --> 48:42.280]  Everything I told you happening.
[48:42.280 --> 48:44.280]  Boom, boom, boom.
[48:44.280 --> 48:48.280]  That's why we're exploding and bigger than you seeing it in.
[48:48.280 --> 48:50.280]  You are, you are, you are jokers.
[48:50.280 --> 48:52.280]  You are, you are frauds.
[48:52.280 --> 48:53.280]  We're right.
[48:53.280 --> 48:54.280]  You're wrong.
[48:54.280 --> 48:55.280]  We tell the truth.
[48:55.280 --> 48:56.280]  You lie.
[48:56.280 --> 48:57.280]  We're honorable.
[48:57.280 --> 48:58.280]  You're dishonorable.
[48:58.280 --> 48:59.280]  We love America.
[48:59.280 --> 49:00.280]  You hate America.
[49:00.280 --> 49:01.280]  Dirtbag.
[49:01.280 --> 49:02.280]  We have your WikiLeaks.
[49:02.280 --> 49:03.280]  We know you hate the country.
[49:03.280 --> 49:05.280]  You want to conquer us and break our will.
[49:05.280 --> 49:06.280]  Guess what?
[49:06.280 --> 49:07.280]  It didn't happen.
[49:07.280 --> 49:09.280]  And you think I hate it when you lie about me?
[49:09.280 --> 49:11.280]  I love it.
[49:11.280 --> 49:15.280]  People call me, I had a big national talk show host call me last night.
[49:15.280 --> 49:17.280]  I was like, how are you doing under all this attack?
[49:17.280 --> 49:18.280]  I'm doing great.
[49:18.280 --> 49:19.280]  Wow.
[49:19.280 --> 49:21.280]  Times never been better.
[49:21.280 --> 49:25.280]  Got a bunch of traitorous scum attacking us.
[49:25.280 --> 49:27.280]  So let's give you some of the background.
[49:27.280 --> 49:29.280]  Here is Pew Research.
[49:29.280 --> 49:30.280]  This is old news.
[49:30.280 --> 49:31.280]  We'll get to the new in a minute.
[49:31.280 --> 49:34.280]  Part of where Trump draws his analysis.
[49:34.280 --> 49:38.280]  Let's go ahead and play that short Fox business piece.
[49:38.280 --> 49:45.280]  Pew, 24 million people, one of every eight voter registrations in the U.S. are no longer
[49:45.280 --> 49:47.280]  valid or significantly inaccurate.
[49:47.280 --> 49:52.280]  More than 1.8 million dead people are listed as voters.
[49:52.280 --> 49:54.280]  So you could use that name.
[49:54.280 --> 49:55.280]  Go ahead and vote.
[49:55.280 --> 49:59.280]  Approximately 2.75 million people, two and three quarter million people are registered
[49:59.280 --> 50:01.280]  in more than one state.
[50:01.280 --> 50:06.280]  So that is outlines, I think, the possibility of voter fraud.
[50:06.280 --> 50:08.280]  Okay, so let's just stop right there.
[50:08.280 --> 50:10.280]  It's proved in these studies going back years.
[50:10.280 --> 50:12.280]  We're going to show you when we come back.
[50:12.280 --> 50:16.280]  But don't forget we have Project Veritas and all the other investigative journalists
[50:16.280 --> 50:20.280]  with the head of elections in New York saying every election, they bust illegals and poor
[50:20.280 --> 50:23.280]  people around to vote dozens of times a piece.
[50:23.280 --> 50:27.280]  Let's not forget we have all the video of the people actually running it for the wine
[50:27.280 --> 50:31.280]  house and Hillary admitting the giant fraud and saying F them.
[50:31.280 --> 50:35.280]  Even if we get caught, nothing will stop us.
[50:35.280 --> 50:37.280]  So we're just going to keep piling on.
[50:37.280 --> 50:40.280]  But when we come back, there's just too much evidence.
[50:40.280 --> 50:46.280]  The new info that absolutely proves what Trump's saying, which shows Trump's actually already
[50:46.280 --> 50:50.280]  read these studies and was just baiting them to say he was a liar knowing it would come
[50:50.280 --> 50:52.280]  out and totally expose them.
[50:52.280 --> 50:53.280]  This is incredible.
[50:53.280 --> 50:55.280]  It's all coming up straight ahead.

[54:27.280 --> 54:30.280]  We are back live, ladies and gentlemen.
[54:30.280 --> 54:32.280]  I'm your host, Alice Jones.
[54:32.280 --> 54:36.280]  All right, let's get into the new meat and potatoes.
[54:36.280 --> 54:40.280]  And again, we're putting together reports with the graphs, the numbers, the facts.
[54:40.280 --> 54:46.280]  We even employ part-time a statistician that works for one of the largest corporations in the world.
[54:46.280 --> 54:51.280]  He has to secretly go over our data for us because obviously, you know, you can't work with the enemy,
[54:51.280 --> 54:53.280]  the American people that actually work for a major corporation.
[54:53.280 --> 54:57.280]  That's the way the black balling works, but we work with multiple statisticians, actually.
[54:57.280 --> 55:00.280]  I'm going to ask Professor John a lot.
[55:00.280 --> 55:04.280]  In fact, today I'm going to call him and ask him to try to crunch the numbers on the voting.
[55:04.280 --> 55:06.280]  He's one of the top statisticians in the world.
[55:06.280 --> 55:11.280]  He's listed in the top 10 by the big international organizations that are out there.
[55:11.280 --> 55:15.280]  I'm going to ask him to do it as well because I want to be able to say we have the top statistician
[55:15.280 --> 55:17.280]  looking at this instead of just me.
[55:17.280 --> 55:24.280]  But we have statisticians in these big university studies and a corporate study showing the same numbers
[55:24.280 --> 55:28.280]  year after year just getting bigger, the same pattern.
[55:28.280 --> 55:35.280]  So while other outlets fact-check Trump info wars provides alternative facts, isn't that just special?
[55:35.280 --> 55:38.280]  Well, we actually bought the study.
[55:38.280 --> 55:40.280]  We didn't just read the synopsis.
[55:40.280 --> 55:43.280]  We went and paid the 20 bucks for the major university study.
[55:43.280 --> 55:51.280]  We have George Mason University and Old Dominion University combining their research and their studies.
[55:51.280 --> 55:55.280]  Right here if you guys are looking for it with the camera.
[55:55.280 --> 55:59.280]  Do non-citizens vote in U.S. elections?
[55:59.280 --> 56:07.280]  This is from January 2014, two years ago.
[56:07.280 --> 56:14.280]  And the findings are non-citizen votes likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome
[56:14.280 --> 56:22.280]  filibusters in order to pass health care reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress.
[56:22.280 --> 56:24.280]  And then you get to the actual study.
[56:24.280 --> 56:27.280]  They look at illegals voting and in general elections.
[56:27.280 --> 56:36.280]  But most importantly, illegals also again affecting the electoral college, which the Democrats brag is their secret weapon.
[56:36.280 --> 56:43.280]  The study examines participation rates by non-citizens using a nationally represented sample that includes non-citizen immigrants.
[56:43.280 --> 56:51.280]  We find that some non-citizens participate in the U.S. elections and this participation has been large enough to change meaningful election outcomes
[56:51.280 --> 56:57.280]  including federal college, electoral college votes and congressional elections.
[56:57.280 --> 57:02.280]  Non-citizen votes likely gave Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote and it goes on from there.
[57:02.280 --> 57:10.280]  Read it for yourself, George Mason University, Old Dominion, very respected political science.
[57:10.280 --> 57:18.280]  Since the audit, non-citizen population in the United States was roughly 19.4 million, the number of non-citizen voters including both
[57:18.280 --> 57:26.280]  uncertainty based on normality distribution sampling error, the various combinations of verified reporting could range from just 38,000
[57:26.280 --> 57:33.280]  at the minimum to nearly 2.8 million at the maximum and it goes on though only a limited sample of the country.
[57:33.280 --> 57:35.280]  So they did a full sample to be much higher.
[57:35.280 --> 57:38.280]  That's a limited sample as high as 2.8 million.
[57:38.280 --> 57:42.280]  And that study doesn't even deal with the Democrats.
[57:42.280 --> 57:43.280]  This is Politico.
[57:43.280 --> 57:45.280]  This is Politico.
[57:45.280 --> 57:50.280]  October 3rd, 2015, illegal immigrants could elect Hillary.
[57:50.280 --> 57:52.280]  Illegal immigrants could elect Hillary.
[57:52.280 --> 57:57.280]  Illegal immigrants could elect Hillary.
[57:57.280 --> 58:05.280]  Let me tell CNN, New York Times, illegal immigrants could elect Hillary.
[58:05.280 --> 58:10.280]  How non-citizens decrease Republican chances of winning the White House next year.
[58:10.280 --> 58:18.280]  And they talk about the demographic and giving them more electoral college votes in your state by the millions in California alone to win.
[58:18.280 --> 58:24.280]  It's estimated that they've added in just 10 years 4 million people to California that are illegals.
[58:24.280 --> 58:28.280]  Not to mention tens of millions nationwide, ladies and gentlemen, over 10 million nationwide.
[58:28.280 --> 58:29.280]  What's that right there?
[58:29.280 --> 58:38.280]  That's in the electoral college a total number for the state that's much higher proving Trump just on this, just on the electoral college.
[58:38.280 --> 58:39.280]  Do you understand?
[58:39.280 --> 58:44.280]  He defeated the biggest rigging ever with such a landslide they couldn't stop him.
[58:44.280 --> 58:45.280]  Trump's right.
[58:45.280 --> 58:47.280]  Trump's been proven correct.
[58:47.280 --> 58:51.280]  You lying pack of scum.
[58:51.280 --> 58:58.280]  I am very proud to announce the introduction of the highest quality info wars biome defense probiotic.
[58:58.280 --> 59:12.280]  We wanted to come out with the largest spectrum of high quality known probiotics that have been proven to improve overall digestion and health and detoxification in the body.
[59:12.280 --> 59:24.280]  Biome defense is an exclusive blend of 50 billion live and active cultures from over 23 different probiotic strains that are known to support digestion and intestinal function.
[59:24.280 --> 59:31.280]  Our researchers are confident that we have been able to develop what will be the leading probiotic on the market.
[59:31.280 --> 59:40.280]  Secure your biome defense in ultra strength or regular strength at infowarslife.com today and get started supporting your digestive system naturally.
[59:40.280 --> 59:44.280]  We've been testing this formula for years, but this is the limited first round of the public.
[59:44.280 --> 59:52.280]  So please take advantage of it today, support your own health and support the info war.
[59:52.280 --> 1:00:02.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:02.280 --> 1:00:17.280]  Before America can be great again, she must be free again.
[1:00:17.280 --> 1:00:21.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:29.280]  Now before I go on with my euphoric support of Trump, he has tacitly on the surface backed off his promise to prosecute Hillary.
[1:00:29.280 --> 1:00:33.280]  The problem is the president can't make that promise. It's not his position.
[1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:39.280]  He just should say he will not stand in the way of the law being carried out and sessions have said he will recuse himself.
[1:00:39.280 --> 1:00:46.280]  He didn't say I might if she's indicted. He says I will recuse myself basically when she's indicted.
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:47.280]  So that's some good news.
[1:00:47.280 --> 1:00:56.280]  But on the surface, that kind of hurts his perfect score of unprecedented delivery of everything he said he would do.
[1:00:56.280 --> 1:01:02.280]  And then there's a place where he's wrong and that's torture.
[1:01:02.280 --> 1:01:05.280]  And yes, I know they've been teaching torture for over 100 years.
[1:01:05.280 --> 1:01:09.280]  I know that the military has been torturing people for a long time.
[1:01:09.280 --> 1:01:11.280]  I know that's not any big secret.
[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:19.280]  Green Berets with hook, you know, a field radio kind of crank up to people's genitals and crank it to get the answers.
[1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:23.280]  And they say torture works. You get the answers real quick.
[1:01:23.280 --> 1:01:27.280]  The problem is the government that will do that pretty soon starts doing it for fake confessions.
[1:01:27.280 --> 1:01:29.280]  And pretty soon you turn into what you're fighting.
[1:01:29.280 --> 1:01:32.280]  So I think it's the only area where Trump's wrong. Here's the problem.
[1:01:32.280 --> 1:01:35.280]  Trump knows the military's doing it. He's not going to lie about it.
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:37.280]  See, that's the difference.
[1:01:37.280 --> 1:01:41.280]  And I've got to say it's kind of heaven and hell, isn't it?
[1:01:41.280 --> 1:01:44.280]  Because it's very good to hear him be honest about it.
[1:01:44.280 --> 1:01:48.280]  But it's not good to then know that he's doing it.
[1:01:48.280 --> 1:01:59.280]  But it's still like sickeningly refreshing. And I mean, it's sickening but refreshing that he's just honest about it.
[1:01:59.280 --> 1:02:02.280]  Donald Trump says torture absolutely works, but does it.
[1:02:02.280 --> 1:02:07.280]  And see, I don't like being in the position of seeing in breaking down the fact that it doesn't always work.
[1:02:07.280 --> 1:02:11.280]  Oh, and folks at the North Koreans do it.
[1:02:11.280 --> 1:02:15.280]  I mean, I don't know many people that were in the military and actual combats that didn't torture people.
[1:02:15.280 --> 1:02:18.280]  I mean, that's just, it goes on in mass and they torture right back.
[1:02:18.280 --> 1:02:29.280]  And I can't say if I found somebody who doused their kid in gasoline and then had the helicopter land to save him and then blew themselves up or tried to, you know, that that person or whoever helped him shouldn't probably get tortured.
[1:02:29.280 --> 1:02:34.280]  I would, I'm going to be honest, I would probably in the, you know, fit at the moment, kill him.
[1:02:34.280 --> 1:02:39.280]  But that's the kind of stories that I've had family tell me.
[1:02:39.280 --> 1:02:48.280]  Just about, you know, you fight adversary so slimy and so low, Trump says, well, they go low, we go low.
[1:02:48.280 --> 1:02:55.280]  But I've got to tell you, like the British Prime Minister coming here being very supportive of Trump and Brexit and the fighting against globalism, but she has to have the proviso.
[1:02:55.280 --> 1:02:58.280]  We don't torture.
[1:02:58.280 --> 1:03:04.280]  Even though British troops do torture people, maybe they didn't tell her.
[1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:10.280]  So see, Trump knows his institutionalized and he's been told by people he respects that sir, we need this.
[1:03:10.280 --> 1:03:15.280]  And so he's so.
[1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:19.280]  Honorable that he won't even lie about it.
[1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:22.280]  But then you can say that it's not a good thing.
[1:03:22.280 --> 1:03:23.280]  So it's a real paradox.
[1:03:23.280 --> 1:03:26.280]  It's, it's one of the biggest paradoxes I've ever seen in my life.
[1:03:26.280 --> 1:03:33.280]  That's what you get with Trump is because he really does what he says he'll do.
[1:03:33.280 --> 1:03:38.280]  And you know, quite frankly, if I think something's a distraction, I'm just not even going to go there.
[1:03:38.280 --> 1:03:39.280]  And Trump's not going to go there either.
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:40.280]  But this is the real deal.
[1:03:40.280 --> 1:03:44.280]  This is somebody really trying to save the country in its darkest hour.
[1:03:44.280 --> 1:03:47.280]  This is our darkest hour since Trenton, New Jersey.
[1:03:47.280 --> 1:03:50.280]  Make it or break it for the Republic.
[1:03:50.280 --> 1:04:00.280]  And I want to believe he knows what he's doing, but there's that one thing hangs out in the middle that is wrong.
[1:04:00.280 --> 1:04:05.280]  And I think it could end up being our downfall.
[1:04:05.280 --> 1:04:08.280]  If he's openly saying torture is okay.
[1:04:08.280 --> 1:04:14.280]  And then there's some type of horrible abuses of like children, like an Abu Ghraib that happened.
[1:04:14.280 --> 1:04:21.280]  And then that the people running things that have infiltrated will use that to frame Trump.
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:26.280]  And I think he's really walking into a trap.
[1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:31.280]  He's walking into a trap and I would say, Mr. President, disavow it.
[1:04:31.280 --> 1:04:37.280]  Say, look, I understand sometimes with al-Qaeda, people get rough, they take the gloves off, but we're not going to codify this into law.
[1:04:37.280 --> 1:04:46.280]  If you do not codify something like that into law, because it's something that shouldn't be done, except in extraordinary emergency situations,
[1:04:46.280 --> 1:04:54.280]  let's just be honest, where people are going to die and you're dealing with a scumbag that you know has just killed a bunch of people right in front of you.
[1:04:54.280 --> 1:04:56.280]  And if you're going to torture them, you've got to kill them after.
[1:04:56.280 --> 1:05:25.280]  I mean, I'm just going to be honest, that's what my gut tells me.
[1:05:27.280 --> 1:05:31.280]  Brazil's own drain the swamp has been called Yava Jato, or Car Wash.
[1:05:31.280 --> 1:05:37.280]  It has produced many arrests, including Cabral's top aide and former secretary in Rio, Wilson Carlos Carvalho,
[1:05:37.280 --> 1:05:42.280]  former governor of Rio, Anthony Garatinho, under suspicion of vote rigging,
[1:05:42.280 --> 1:05:48.280]  a former top executive with Batista Flavio Godinho, accused of money laundering and association with Cabral,
[1:05:48.280 --> 1:05:52.280]  and another top aide of Cabral's, Carlos Miranda, has also been jailed,
[1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:57.280]  showing the United States that it is possible to drain the swamp and nobody is above the law.
[1:05:57.280 --> 1:06:22.280]  This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com.
[1:06:27.280 --> 1:06:30.280]  It breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more.
[1:06:30.280 --> 1:06:33.280]  And it supports him and it supports infowars and our whole operation.
[1:06:33.280 --> 1:06:38.280]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area, if not to the very top of the charts.
[1:06:38.280 --> 1:06:41.280]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing.
[1:06:41.280 --> 1:06:43.280]  They're in full crisis mode.
[1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:44.280]  National's movements are exploding.
[1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:46.280]  Everybody needs to go pre-order.
[1:06:46.280 --> 1:06:48.280]  So you get it first at infowarsstore.com.
[1:06:48.280 --> 1:06:51.280]  The making of a president by Roger Stone.
[1:06:51.280 --> 1:06:52.280]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:06:52.280 --> 1:06:54.280]  I'm going on airplane to go to the inaugural event with Trump.
[1:06:54.280 --> 1:06:58.280]  Pray for us and please continue to support the operation and get his book now.
[1:06:58.280 --> 1:07:00.280]  You're the first to have a trip to you.
[1:07:00.280 --> 1:07:05.280]  You're investing in your health and supporting the info war when you visit infowarslife.com
[1:07:05.280 --> 1:07:11.280]  and purchase your supply of survival shield X2 nascent iodine and all the great products at infowarslife.com.
[1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:17.280]  As you know, we've talked to pharmacists, chemists, doctors, researchers, scientists and the answer is clear.
[1:07:17.280 --> 1:07:22.280]  Iodine is key, is paramount and there's still so much new information coming out
[1:07:22.280 --> 1:07:24.280]  that we simply can't even keep up with it.
[1:07:24.280 --> 1:07:31.280]  In our quest for the purest iodine, we drill down more than 7,000 feet to gather these purple blue crystals
[1:07:31.280 --> 1:07:33.280]  to extract the ultra pure iodine.
[1:07:33.280 --> 1:07:37.280]  On top of that, we also screen our iodine for radiation before bottling.
[1:07:37.280 --> 1:07:40.280]  It is the purest, cleanest, strongest out there.
[1:07:40.280 --> 1:07:44.280]  Quite frankly, I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nascent iodine
[1:07:44.280 --> 1:07:49.280]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[1:07:49.280 --> 1:07:53.280]  of an unable to come up with anything even close to what we have.
[1:07:53.280 --> 1:08:21.280]  It is exclusive to infowarslife.com and the infowarslife family of incredible products.
[1:08:21.280 --> 1:08:47.280]  Alright, as everyone knows, infowars gets attacked conservatively hundreds of times a day
[1:08:47.280 --> 1:08:50.280]  just in print media and on national television.
[1:08:50.280 --> 1:08:52.280]  Well, sometimes we get attacked thousands of times a day.
[1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:55.280]  In the last few days, it's been reaching those numbers.
[1:08:55.280 --> 1:08:59.280]  New York Times, CNN, ABC News, CBS, you name it.
[1:08:59.280 --> 1:09:01.280]  They go after their main enemies.
[1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:04.280]  They say, Alex Jones is a total line cook.
[1:09:04.280 --> 1:09:06.280]  There's no proof of election fraud ever.
[1:09:06.280 --> 1:09:08.280]  It's totally insane.
[1:09:08.280 --> 1:09:11.280]  Same folks told you that Obamacare was free.
[1:09:11.280 --> 1:09:14.280]  Then they say, and Trump's nuts, he gets his info from Alex Jones,
[1:09:14.280 --> 1:09:18.280]  which might be true maybe 2% of the time.
[1:09:18.280 --> 1:09:21.280]  Yes, Trump sometimes listens to the show, watches videos, reads articles.
[1:09:21.280 --> 1:09:25.280]  He reads everything in his words.
[1:09:25.280 --> 1:09:29.280]  So they then try to discredit Trump and they discredit us with a strawman.
[1:09:29.280 --> 1:09:31.280]  The reason that's important is it's a tactic.
[1:09:31.280 --> 1:09:34.280]  They're attacking what they're scared of.
[1:09:34.280 --> 1:09:36.280]  Now, he just joined us the last hour.
[1:09:36.280 --> 1:09:42.280]  I spent 30 minutes laying out major university studies,
[1:09:42.280 --> 1:09:48.280]  internal democratic party memos, and even Politico, Bloomberg, you name it.
[1:09:48.280 --> 1:09:54.280]  Admitting in their words, their secret weapon is illegals voting
[1:09:54.280 --> 1:10:00.280]  and changing the electoral college so that a state represents more votes as a block.
[1:10:00.280 --> 1:10:05.280]  And admitting that California alone via illegals in the last three election cycles
[1:10:05.280 --> 1:10:10.280]  has added more than 4 million people to its voting roles
[1:10:10.280 --> 1:10:15.280]  because even though they're not voting, they're counted as a block in the electoral college.
[1:10:15.280 --> 1:10:19.280]  It counts the entire population, not just voters.
[1:10:19.280 --> 1:10:22.280]  This is total proof that Trump is right.
[1:10:22.280 --> 1:10:27.280]  Then we found a bunch of other studies with millions of dead people voting
[1:10:27.280 --> 1:10:31.280]  and millions of illegals voting.
[1:10:31.280 --> 1:10:33.280]  It's mind blowing.
[1:10:33.280 --> 1:10:35.280]  We just laid it all out for everybody.
[1:10:35.280 --> 1:10:39.280]  We're going to take that excise piece from the second half of the first hour
[1:10:39.280 --> 1:10:42.280]  and post it as soon as we can to infowars.com.
[1:10:42.280 --> 1:10:45.280]  So if you're a radio loser, you can share it with your friends and family and see it yourself.
[1:10:45.280 --> 1:10:47.280]  Because this is an info war.
[1:10:47.280 --> 1:10:51.280]  And we're going to continue to hurt CNN and hurt the global crime syndicate
[1:10:51.280 --> 1:10:56.280]  every time Don Lemon comes out and calls Trump a liar and says there's just no proof.
[1:10:56.280 --> 1:10:57.280]  It's insane.
[1:10:57.280 --> 1:11:01.280]  And he has a bozo the clown looking New York Times guy up there
[1:11:01.280 --> 1:11:04.280]  looking like, you know, the cat ate the canary going.
[1:11:04.280 --> 1:11:08.280]  It's just hard to deal with it when a president has no proof and says these things.
[1:11:08.280 --> 1:11:11.280]  The problem is there's too much proof.
[1:11:11.280 --> 1:11:14.280]  But just like Obamacare said, it had death panels.
[1:11:14.280 --> 1:11:18.280]  It had committees that decided who got treatment, bioethics.
[1:11:18.280 --> 1:11:23.280]  Just like it had 18,000 IRS agents in it to raise taxes on people
[1:11:23.280 --> 1:11:27.280]  and have $5,000 penalties that started hitting two years ago
[1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:30.280]  and phased up 2017 at $5,000.
[1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:36.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, my crew didn't want a bunch of didn't want Obamacare
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:40.280]  and a bunch of the crew got hit with penalties and we started getting hit with them last year.
[1:11:40.280 --> 1:11:42.280]  Oh, but it doesn't exist.
[1:11:42.280 --> 1:11:47.280]  You just get tens of thousands of dollars of notices from the IRS.
[1:11:47.280 --> 1:11:51.280]  But you see Don Lemon's laughing at me because it doesn't exist.
[1:11:51.280 --> 1:11:52.280]  See, he said so.
[1:11:52.280 --> 1:11:54.280]  He's arrogant, Don.
[1:11:54.280 --> 1:11:56.280]  Don Lemon.
[1:11:56.280 --> 1:12:00.280]  I just think about how arrogant his head is, how arrogant his face is.
[1:12:00.280 --> 1:12:02.280]  I want to play that first again.
[1:12:02.280 --> 1:12:06.280]  I want to play the fact that they're claiming there's Trump's war on media and then
[1:12:06.280 --> 1:12:11.280]  there's a five minute CNN clip from last night attacking yours truly
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:15.280]  where they say that Trump gets his alternative facts from info wars again.
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:20.280]  And it's the biggest bunch of bullies ever heard except for one part.
[1:12:20.280 --> 1:12:25.280]  They go, Alex Jones claimed he had press credentials, but they said they haven't been issued to him.
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:28.280]  I said, we've been offered them and we're going to get them.
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:29.280]  And I've been talking to folks.
[1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:30.280]  It doesn't even matter.
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:33.280]  They have to give them to me if we have somebody that lives in D.C.
[1:12:33.280 --> 1:12:37.280]  It's a non issue, but they want to rub on the idea that I lied about that
[1:12:37.280 --> 1:12:41.280]  and that we're these losers who are on the outside and aren't press.
[1:12:41.280 --> 1:12:45.280]  It's just just crazy how they play these games by defining things.
[1:12:45.280 --> 1:12:50.280]  But then they go and admit in the piece, but actually Jones can get the credentials if he wants them.
[1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:56.280]  Yeah, I can have 50 people with their credentials.
[1:12:56.280 --> 1:12:59.280]  It just doesn't mean they'll be in the front line White House press corps,
[1:12:59.280 --> 1:13:04.280]  which we don't even particularly want to do except I don't want to let this count out of the bag yet,
[1:13:04.280 --> 1:13:07.280]  but I don't want to terrorize the mainstream media too much.
[1:13:07.280 --> 1:13:11.280]  But I tell you what, just as an experiment, since it freaks you out so much,
[1:13:11.280 --> 1:13:15.280]  we're in the process, they reached out to us top well known veteran journalists
[1:13:15.280 --> 1:13:19.280]  that want to work with them for wars that have worked with top publications and currently do
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:23.280]  coming to work for us who've already had White House press credentials.
[1:13:23.280 --> 1:13:28.280]  So, you know what, instead of having one, I think I'm going to do three.
[1:13:28.280 --> 1:13:32.280]  How's that sound? How's that sound? Just to rub it in.
[1:13:32.280 --> 1:13:38.280]  And then I'm going to play clips of you saying I'm lying forever. How's that sound?
[1:13:38.280 --> 1:13:43.280]  Kind of like I can play clips of saying that Trump's 15 points ahead in polls and your polls are fake,
[1:13:43.280 --> 1:13:47.280]  or that Trump's going to win, or that Trump's going to win Pennsylvania.
[1:13:47.280 --> 1:13:53.280]  And you made fun of that a lot, didn't you? Because you think it's all a big joke or that...
[1:13:53.280 --> 1:13:59.280]  You know what, I'm just going to stop right there. It's just hilarious to watch a bunch of posers,
[1:13:59.280 --> 1:14:05.280]  a bunch of pretenders, sit there and look at me that built my own giant media empire
[1:14:05.280 --> 1:14:09.280]  that reaches billions of people every quarter.
[1:14:09.280 --> 1:14:12.280]  And you sit there and look at us and say, we're pathetic.
[1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:18.280]  When Drougreport.com, new research study out today, is number one in the world
[1:14:18.280 --> 1:14:24.280]  and dwarfs the top 10 media companies combined.
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:28.280]  Ipful Wars, according to Quantcast.
[1:14:28.280 --> 1:14:31.280]  Dwarfs the New York Times. Dwarfs the Washington Post.
[1:14:31.280 --> 1:14:34.280]  But I don't dwarf the top 10 at the same time like Droug does.
[1:14:34.280 --> 1:14:37.280]  And guess what? I love the fact that Droug is so much bigger than us.
[1:14:37.280 --> 1:14:42.280]  It makes me feel so good to know that there are other people out there walking point
[1:14:42.280 --> 1:14:46.280]  in this dangerous situation.
[1:14:46.280 --> 1:14:50.280]  And again, they claim MSM is really number one, but they actually have to admit later that, well,
[1:14:50.280 --> 1:14:54.280]  Droug is number one because ESPN and MSM have a database of emails and fans.
[1:14:54.280 --> 1:14:57.280]  That's how they claim it's bigger. But when you get the total news coverage,
[1:14:57.280 --> 1:15:02.280]  Droug is bigger than Fox News, New York Times, BuzzFeed, all of them combined.
[1:15:02.280 --> 1:15:07.280]  And they do word stuff to us at Quantcast and all these other things.
[1:15:07.280 --> 1:15:11.280]  They just delist us. They just don't even show us. It's a blank until we bitch at them.
[1:15:11.280 --> 1:15:14.280]  Then they post it back up and a day later take it back down.
[1:15:14.280 --> 1:15:19.280]  Because I guess taking us out of the winner's circle makes us not be winners.
[1:15:19.280 --> 1:15:25.280]  I was talking to one fellow who I know pretty well, who was the host of a major survival show,
[1:15:25.280 --> 1:15:27.280]  and they make him sign a contract and it's all entertainment.
[1:15:27.280 --> 1:15:33.280]  And when he won, they said, well, it's not politically correct because you're a white guy from Texas.
[1:15:33.280 --> 1:15:38.280]  We're not going to give you the win. And he said, okay, just took the money.
[1:15:38.280 --> 1:15:43.280]  But that's how this whole thing works. It's really wild to just actually be
[1:15:43.280 --> 1:15:48.280]  in the Google Analytics and to see yourself bigger than all of them
[1:15:48.280 --> 1:15:51.280]  and then to have them sit there laughing at you and thumbing their nose at you
[1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:54.280]  and telling you you're a loser. And again, this isn't about info wars.
[1:15:54.280 --> 1:15:58.280]  It's about the fact that these people are all about rigging everything.
[1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:00.280]  And they wonder why they're a shadow of their former selves.
[1:16:00.280 --> 1:16:03.280]  It's because they're so discredited.
[1:16:03.280 --> 1:16:12.280]  No Don Lemon, no New York Times, no CNN, Trump's not lying.
[1:16:12.280 --> 1:16:16.280]  When he comes out and says three million illegals voted,
[1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:22.280]  they've got studies going back years showing that and we showed them last hour.
[1:16:22.280 --> 1:16:27.280]  But let's go ahead and go to Don Lemon.
[1:16:27.280 --> 1:16:31.280]  I think that in journalism, our role is not to be stenographers.
[1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:36.280]  Our role is to be watchdogs and we have to provide that kind of accountability.
[1:16:36.280 --> 1:16:42.280]  I think when a president or anybody else says something that is verifiably empirically false,
[1:16:42.280 --> 1:16:44.280]  then one has to call them out on it.
[1:16:44.280 --> 1:16:47.280]  Yeah, it's tough to call the president of the United States a liar
[1:16:47.280 --> 1:16:49.280]  because you want to respect the office.
[1:16:49.280 --> 1:16:54.280]  But I think it does a disservice to the American people and even to the president
[1:16:54.280 --> 1:17:00.280]  and even to journalists, not to call. Call it what it is and it is a lie.
[1:17:00.280 --> 1:17:09.280]  No, you are verifiably and empirically a fraud that works for a known organized crime syndicate
[1:17:09.280 --> 1:17:13.280]  known as CNN run by criminal elements of the Central Intelligence Agency.
[1:17:13.280 --> 1:17:18.280]  Gore Vidal, before he died, wrote about the fact that he'd be at CNN
[1:17:18.280 --> 1:17:23.280]  and they would have CIA section chiefs there running the organization
[1:17:23.280 --> 1:17:27.280]  and basically trying to censor him.
[1:17:27.280 --> 1:17:29.280]  This is disgusting.
[1:17:29.280 --> 1:17:33.280]  I mean, Anderson Cooper's been CIA for 20-something years.
[1:17:33.280 --> 1:17:35.280]  What are you doing in the media?
[1:17:35.280 --> 1:17:37.280]  People are like, oh, there's no CIA in the media.
[1:17:37.280 --> 1:17:42.280]  Really, Obama signed a piece of legislation, the NDAA for 2017, a month ago
[1:17:42.280 --> 1:17:49.280]  that said the CIA will be over the board of governors of the FCC through the State Department
[1:17:49.280 --> 1:17:56.280]  and will spend hundreds of millions of dollars countering disinformation in America.
[1:17:56.280 --> 1:18:01.280]  Three years ago, they changed the federal law so the CIA could engage in domestic propaganda.
[1:18:01.280 --> 1:18:06.280]  You want me to pull up foreign affairs, the Washington Post?
[1:18:06.280 --> 1:18:08.280]  Oh, but the CIA is not involved.
[1:18:08.280 --> 1:18:11.280]  They go, Alex Jones is discredited. He says Anderson Cooper was CIA.
[1:18:11.280 --> 1:18:13.280]  Well, he only worked for him previously.
[1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:17.280]  Oh, I see. He only worked for the CIA previously.
[1:18:17.280 --> 1:18:20.280]  Thank you for explaining to me how all that works.
[1:18:20.280 --> 1:18:23.280]  I really appreciate that.
[1:18:23.280 --> 1:18:26.280]  Oh, he's really discredited. Anderson Cooper only worked for him before.
[1:18:26.280 --> 1:18:28.280]  Oh, oh.
[1:18:28.280 --> 1:18:34.280]  And then with no journalistic background, he just comes in and reads off a teleprompter.
[1:18:34.280 --> 1:18:39.280]  Alex is discredited too. He said Trump would repeal Obamacare and now he started doing it.
[1:18:39.280 --> 1:18:45.280]  See, all we do is deliver. All we do is tell the truth or die trying.
[1:18:45.280 --> 1:18:50.280]  And whenever we make mistakes, we come and tell you and we make them routinely on little stuff.
[1:18:50.280 --> 1:18:55.280]  And most of the time I report something is smaller and it was actually bigger.
[1:18:55.280 --> 1:18:59.280]  Just like I was saying last week, 1.3 trillion out of the stock market.
[1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:02.280]  Well, I'm sorry. By the time I was saying that, it was 1.7.
[1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:10.280]  By this, by Monday, it was 2.1. It's now 2.2 trillion as of this morning.
[1:19:10.280 --> 1:19:16.280]  And Trump knows our only hope is to have a super bubble that beats this bubble to actually get industry back,
[1:19:16.280 --> 1:19:20.280]  stabilize things and then to reorganize because they were meaning to pop the bubble about now.
[1:19:20.280 --> 1:19:24.280]  Even if Hillary got in and they had a class war, he's trying to stabilize all that.
[1:19:24.280 --> 1:19:26.280]  I'm not a friend of bubbles and Trump's not either.
[1:19:26.280 --> 1:19:31.280]  But he understands that they've doubled down their betting on this because it's our only hope, folks.
[1:19:31.280 --> 1:19:36.280]  We've all got to hire. We've all got to expand if we want to try to beat these people.
[1:19:36.280 --> 1:19:38.280]  In fact, that's why I'm going to expand. I'm going to hire more.
[1:19:38.280 --> 1:19:45.280]  I'm going to double down everything I can because this is the prosperity that people need to absolutely discredit
[1:19:45.280 --> 1:19:47.280]  crony capitalism and collectivism.
[1:19:47.280 --> 1:19:49.280]  We're going to be right back after this quick break.
[1:19:49.280 --> 1:19:53.280]  And I'm going to get into so much more on the economy, you name it,
[1:19:53.280 --> 1:20:22.280]  and the latest CNN propaganda piece that is unbelievably deceptive. Stay with us.

[1:24:29.280 --> 1:24:38.280]  There's a warning sign on the road ahead. There's a lot of people saying we'd be better off in the dark.
[1:24:38.280 --> 1:24:45.280]  And God always delivers in the darkest hour. And Trump said, my gut told me he was for real.
[1:24:45.280 --> 1:24:52.280]  And he's just over-delivered seven days and it is incredible.
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:24:57.280]  Even the establishment admits that it is a lightning war against them.
[1:24:57.280 --> 1:25:01.280]  It is truly beautiful. Later, I'm going to be breaking that down.
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:11.280]  We also have David Knight, host of the fourth hour, Roger Stone popping in with new information in the third hour.
[1:25:11.280 --> 1:25:19.280]  And I do intend to open the phones up as well later in this hour into the third hour.
[1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:23.280]  I want to start tackling the CNN piece in the next segment because it's so deceptive.
[1:25:23.280 --> 1:25:27.280]  And again, it's bigger than just, oh, look, they're lying about illegal voting.
[1:25:27.280 --> 1:25:32.280]  They're trying to delegitimize Trump's election. They're trying to overthrow the U.S. via globalism,
[1:25:32.280 --> 1:25:38.280]  where you bring in outside groups, have them swear allegiance to your political party and your corporate socialism,
[1:25:38.280 --> 1:25:42.280]  and you conquer the nation. That's what the plan is from the UN.
[1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:49.280]  That's what Peter Sutherland, who founded the EU and runs the UN Migrant Council, says they're doing.
[1:25:49.280 --> 1:25:55.280]  That's where they miscalculated, was admitting their plans. And Trump knows all about this.
[1:25:55.280 --> 1:26:02.280]  Dr. Jerome Corsi has known him well for 40-plus years, worked with him in business and in banking.
[1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:08.280]  And, of course, he also worked for the State Department and a bunch of other things. And he just says, Alex, let me assure you,
[1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:13.280]  about a year and a half ago, I wasn't questioning Trump. I was talking to him off air and on air.
[1:26:13.280 --> 1:26:21.280]  He said, let me just give you a newsflash. Trump knew all about this when he was a young man before you were born.
[1:26:21.280 --> 1:26:26.280]  And I pressed him and others, and I did some research off what I was told and talked to some other people.
[1:26:26.280 --> 1:26:32.280]  And they said, listen, Trump has been waiting his entire life for this.
[1:26:32.280 --> 1:26:43.280]  Trump is basically beyond a John Berger. Trump knew about all this when he was a little kid.
[1:26:43.280 --> 1:26:53.280]  And then later in life, was heavily immersed in it in New York City and has been sitting there watching all these people the whole time getting ready.
[1:26:53.280 --> 1:26:58.280]  You don't just think the enemy has sleeper cells, do you?
[1:26:58.280 --> 1:27:06.280]  I love it. It's crazy. And here's the good part. The minute he turned sideways on us, we know he got compromised, but it's not going to happen.
[1:27:06.280 --> 1:27:11.280]  He's so pig-headed, it's beautiful. He's ready for him to kill him. He doesn't care. He doesn't care.
[1:27:11.280 --> 1:27:16.280]  He told the Secret Service, I don't care what you say, I'm getting out walking down Pennsylvania Avenue.
[1:27:16.280 --> 1:27:22.280]  You see him tugging him, trying to make him get back in. He doesn't care. He wins as they kill him.
[1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:26.280]  He wins as they don't. The only way he loses is if he doesn't deliver.
[1:27:26.280 --> 1:27:34.280]  And I said, I will believe in Trump if he delivers or dies trying. And you know what? He is going to do it or die trying.
[1:27:34.280 --> 1:27:40.280]  And you know what? I'm not going to get into the conversation that with Trump. I'm just going to stop right there because it becomes a diversion.
[1:27:40.280 --> 1:27:45.280]  But let me just tell you, you wouldn't have these discussions with people if you weren't 100% real.
[1:27:45.280 --> 1:27:52.280]  And I've made the joke like, hey, it's like Donald Trump White House is Alex Jones White House, but it's the other way around.
[1:27:52.280 --> 1:27:58.280]  He was around before me. He just had a different way of doing it. I'm not the only person that doesn't like the New World Order.
[1:27:58.280 --> 1:28:03.280]  I was 18 years old and didn't like it when I was in college and decided to fight it right away.
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:09.280]  So I did what I've done in 20-something years. Why, it's 25 years.
[1:28:09.280 --> 1:28:15.280]  With Trump, he has had the super long game, which is the definition of intelligence.
[1:28:15.280 --> 1:28:21.280]  Long patient planning that's executed is the essence of world building.
[1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:27.280]  And I'm telling you, I, from researching things, I need to write a big article about the real Donald Trump.
[1:28:27.280 --> 1:28:32.280]  Just so people know, because I'm sure of it now, he was hiding in plain view because I don't have any, I'm only enamored with power.
[1:28:32.280 --> 1:28:36.280]  Everybody knows that. I can't stand sick of fancy and globalist and pomp.
[1:28:36.280 --> 1:28:43.280]  Trump only did all the pomp and stuff so that they would think he was one of them as camouflage the entire time.
[1:28:43.280 --> 1:28:52.280]  This guy is Uber smart. He's that rare mix of genius and will, but also he's got the Joker in him.
[1:28:52.280 --> 1:29:00.280]  Trump is the big Joker. He's the big, big, big, big magic elf. Everybody's been waiting for folks.
[1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:09.280]  President Claus came to town, ladies and gentlemen. He's been making a list. He's nodding a nice and marking it twice.
[1:29:09.280 --> 1:29:17.280]  So this is the war and it's crazy. And I'm done talking about that when we come back.
[1:29:17.280 --> 1:29:20.280]  Let me tell you, it's an exciting time to be alive, though.
[1:29:20.280 --> 1:29:26.280]  And the enemy's pulling all the stops, too, but they are squirming, they are scared, and they don't know what to do.
[1:29:26.280 --> 1:29:33.280]  But the jolly old elf hit the scene and they are crapping their drawers.
[1:29:33.280 --> 1:29:37.280]  All right, we'll be back. I'm Alex Jones. This is the Info War.
[1:29:37.280 --> 1:29:41.280]  And we're going to come back and break down the CNN piece and more in his war on the media.
[1:29:41.280 --> 1:29:46.280]  No, it's his war on him in America. He's only fighting back. They can't stand that.
[1:29:46.280 --> 1:29:50.280]  When they attack us, we attack back. They go, I have free speech. Yeah, I have free speech to counter you.
[1:29:50.280 --> 1:29:57.280]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[1:30:21.280 --> 1:30:28.280]  It has produced many arrests, including Cabral's top aide and former secretary in Rio, Wilson Carlos Carvalho,
[1:30:28.280 --> 1:30:32.280]  former governor of Rio, Anthony Garatinho, under suspicion of vote rigging,
[1:30:32.280 --> 1:30:38.280]  a former top executive with Batista Flavio Godinho, accused of money laundering in association with Cabral,
[1:30:38.280 --> 1:30:46.280]  and another top aide of Cabral, who was also arrested in conjunction with activities involving the state-owned oil company Petrobas.
[1:30:46.280 --> 1:30:51.280]  Accused of money laundering in association with Cabral, and another top aide of Cabral's, Carlos Miranda,
[1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:57.280]  has also been jailed, showing the United States that it is possible to drain the swamp and nobody is above the law.
[1:30:57.280 --> 1:31:20.280]  This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[1:31:28.280 --> 1:31:33.280]  To the best job you can to purify your air. The elite are masters at poisoning our environment,
[1:31:33.280 --> 1:31:38.280]  while themselves doing things that mitigate or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[1:31:38.280 --> 1:31:44.280]  The general public doesn't. The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:31:44.280 --> 1:31:48.280]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:31:48.280 --> 1:31:55.280]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[1:31:55.280 --> 1:32:00.280]  That's about why this system is so revolutionary today at InfowarsStore.com.
[1:32:25.280 --> 1:32:31.280]  We've brought out a lot of amazing products like Survival Shield X2, SuperMail Vitality and so many others,
[1:32:31.280 --> 1:32:37.280]  with its unique delivery system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[1:32:37.280 --> 1:32:43.280]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products, and this part is most important.
[1:32:43.280 --> 1:32:50.280]  The ingredients in vitamin mineral fusion are either plant-derived or of the highest quality lab standard.
[1:32:50.280 --> 1:32:56.280]  That means it's clean, that means it's pure, and rest-secured, you're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowars.
[1:32:56.280 --> 1:33:23.280]  InfowarsLife.com and Vitamin Mineral Fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[1:33:23.280 --> 1:33:32.280]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:32.280 --> 1:33:37.280]  Yeah, the New World Order pyramid is in deep trouble.
[1:33:37.280 --> 1:33:42.280]  Once we expose it, the top-down control system is game over.
[1:33:42.280 --> 1:33:53.280]  Donald Trump is overthrowing the New World Order. Donald Trump, with your backing, is the wrecking ball that's being taken to the tyrannical planetary regime.
[1:33:53.280 --> 1:34:01.280]  Move over. That's right.
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:13.280]  I would open the phones up. The toll-free number to join us is 800-25-99231.
[1:34:13.280 --> 1:34:18.280]  While other outlets fact-checked Trump, Infowars provides alternative facts.
[1:34:18.280 --> 1:34:31.280]  And I was actually watching this yesterday and saw them attack me. The video clip is a shorter clip where we're not in there, but the point is that they're coming after us all over the place, again saying we're putting out alternative facts.
[1:34:31.280 --> 1:34:39.280]  That's a Conway quote. Not the best word to use, but we don't believe known liars. We go out and do our own research.
[1:34:39.280 --> 1:34:44.280]  That's the response to them calling us fake news, conspiracy theorists, all this. It's not working anymore.
[1:34:44.280 --> 1:34:56.280]  Truth, trust, and Trump. They're trying to erode the trust in Trump when they have no trust, and his lowest Rasmussen poll, as well as Gallup, was 41 and 43, respectively.
[1:34:56.280 --> 1:35:06.280]  Rasmussen and Gallup now have him sitting, ladies and gentlemen, at 59 points, and that's using a sample that skews towards Democrats.
[1:35:06.280 --> 1:35:11.280]  People go, how do you know that? I've studied polls. I've paid for polls to be commissioned.
[1:35:11.280 --> 1:35:19.280]  I've said I want a straight poll done by big companies. They go, we're not doing it the way you want, or we're not working with you.
[1:35:19.280 --> 1:35:28.280]  Republican and Democrats, they want a closed shop of information, a monopoly of info, and they're panicking because Trump is smashing all of that.
[1:35:28.280 --> 1:35:33.280]  Trump is destroying that.
[1:35:33.280 --> 1:35:45.280]  So let's go ahead and go to this first clip here that I've been mentioning, poll free number 800-25-99231. There's so many to get to, but this deals with Trump and the media. Here it is.
[1:35:45.280 --> 1:35:49.280]  They're very hostile. These are very hostile people. These are very angry people.
[1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:53.280]  But they're also colluded against you in the campaign. My question to you is...
[1:35:53.280 --> 1:35:57.280]  Well, they're very dishonest people. The media is very dishonest. I've been saying it, I say it openly.
[1:35:57.280 --> 1:35:59.280]  I said journalism is dead, so we agree.
[1:35:59.280 --> 1:36:03.280]  Never, never dead, but they're very dishonest people. In many cases.
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:11.280]  Look, you have some very honest ones, but I get stories that are so false and so dishonest.
[1:36:11.280 --> 1:36:13.280]  Martin Luther King's bust?
[1:36:13.280 --> 1:36:19.280]  Yeah, they said Martin Luther King's bust was taken out of the Oval Office by me.
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:20.280]  It's there.
[1:36:20.280 --> 1:36:26.280]  See, that's a very serious charge because they're not saying the bust is taken out. What they're saying is that I'm a racist. That's what they're saying.
[1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:28.280]  That's a very serious charge.
[1:36:28.280 --> 1:36:32.280]  Then it turned out the bust... It wasn't... In fact, I got very angry at my people.
[1:36:32.280 --> 1:36:35.280]  I said, who took that bust out because I wasn't there?
[1:36:35.280 --> 1:36:40.280]  And they said it was never moved. It was in the same exact spot. It was never moved.
[1:36:40.280 --> 1:36:44.280]  They said, how could they say it? A reporter said that it was taken out.
[1:36:44.280 --> 1:36:49.280]  But that's a very, very serious charge because that's a racist charge.
[1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:56.280]  Then when it was revealed that they were wrong, nobody even talks about it.
[1:36:56.280 --> 1:37:01.280]  That's right. And when they say that no one was there and show a shot of when the gates first opened for the inauguration,
[1:37:01.280 --> 1:37:04.280]  he comes out and says they're lying.
[1:37:04.280 --> 1:37:10.280]  That's a big deal to have North Korean-style media and they go, oh, stop bitching. No one was there for you. I was there. It was full.
[1:37:10.280 --> 1:37:17.280]  You go to the Gigapixel shot CNN has on their own page and it shows the whole thing jam-packed.
[1:37:17.280 --> 1:37:20.280]  And Don Lemon comes out and says, no, he's a liar. He had a small crowd.
[1:37:20.280 --> 1:37:28.280]  Don Lemon has no viewers. But he has this weird little arrogant con artist face
[1:37:28.280 --> 1:37:33.280]  so that the rest of the con artists at CNN go, oh, look, this con artist will con them.
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:36.280]  Let's just keep doubling and trippling down.
[1:37:36.280 --> 1:37:41.280]  So let's go to this next piece dealing with Trump.
[1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:47.280]  This is where they claim that while other outlets fact check Trump info wars provides alternative facts.
[1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:52.280]  Now, again, alternative facts like university study.
[1:37:52.280 --> 1:38:05.280]  Old Dominion University, George Mason University concluding that upwards of 2.8 million illegals voted and swung key elections in 2014.
[1:38:05.280 --> 1:38:15.280]  And then they've come out again in the Washington Times today and said they found just in a limited sample, 800,000 illegals voting.
[1:38:15.280 --> 1:38:21.280]  And then you've got their own internal memos and you've got Bloomberg and you've got AP and you've got what Politico.
[1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:24.280]  Here it is. I'll show you illegal immigrants could elect Hillary.
[1:38:24.280 --> 1:38:28.280]  How noncitizens decrease Republican chances of winning the White House next year.
[1:38:28.280 --> 1:38:32.280]  And how the electoral college is done off census.
[1:38:32.280 --> 1:38:36.280]  It's like it isn't just like it isn't Leviticus in the Old Testament.
[1:38:36.280 --> 1:38:44.280]  It's off the census. The number of the people and then you get that number of electoral votes in your state for how big your population is.
[1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:49.280]  For House members, even if those people don't vote.
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:57.280]  And then that is also counted up for the number of electoral votes you get representing voters.
[1:38:57.280 --> 1:39:05.280]  And so that's how it counts as millions of extra votes in California alone of how Hillary won.
[1:39:05.280 --> 1:39:09.280]  There's more than 3 million illegals admittedly in the population of California.
[1:39:09.280 --> 1:39:12.280]  It's more than 4 million just the last decade confirmed there.
[1:39:12.280 --> 1:39:20.280]  And so there's the votes right there in the California electoral college numbers that went for Hillary and not Trump.
[1:39:20.280 --> 1:39:23.280]  Because that's how they condense the individual votes.
[1:39:23.280 --> 1:39:30.280]  What he's saying is way low. It's 7, 8, 9, 10 million on the conservative side.
[1:39:30.280 --> 1:39:34.280]  Not 3 million Mr. President.
[1:39:34.280 --> 1:39:36.280]  It's bombshell.
[1:39:36.280 --> 1:39:42.280]  Because we're only looking at the admitted 20-something million dead people still in the rolls and 10-something million illegals on the rolls.
[1:39:42.280 --> 1:39:46.280]  And going, well, how do you prove it? You know what? The Democrats are trying to get them to vote.
[1:39:46.280 --> 1:39:49.280]  We know this is going on. I mean, I don't want to harp on this all day.
[1:39:49.280 --> 1:39:53.280]  But this is critical because he's got an investigation going into all this.
[1:39:53.280 --> 1:39:57.280]  And the Republican Party doesn't want this information out there because they want Trump to be defeated. They're globalists.
[1:39:57.280 --> 1:40:00.280]  And so they're hoping all this doesn't come out.
[1:40:00.280 --> 1:40:05.280]  Well, we're going to make sure it does. And our beautiful audience is going to make sure it all comes out.
[1:40:05.280 --> 1:40:08.280]  Because this is what's going on. And Trump's been proven right again.
[1:40:08.280 --> 1:40:11.280]  Let's play part of this CNN piece. Here it is.
[1:40:11.280 --> 1:40:15.280]  Welcome back to Reliable Sources. I'm Brian Stelter, live from Washington, DC.
[1:40:15.280 --> 1:40:19.280]  Hit pause. Back it up. Let's just put a screen. Reliable sources, everything.
[1:40:19.280 --> 1:40:23.280]  We're reliable like a white truck pulls up at the playground.
[1:40:23.280 --> 1:40:28.280]  He goes, we have free candy. We have puppies. We have comic books.
[1:40:28.280 --> 1:40:31.280]  That's the equivalent, you know, to kids of reliable sources.
[1:40:31.280 --> 1:40:35.280]  Oh, look, there's a puppy painted on the side of the truck.
[1:40:35.280 --> 1:40:39.280]  Oh, hi. Come on in the back of the truck. Come on, America.
[1:40:39.280 --> 1:40:42.280]  Come in here so we can strangle you and slave you.
[1:40:42.280 --> 1:40:44.280]  Control you. Look at this guy.
[1:40:44.280 --> 1:40:47.280]  Look at it. They've got a higher to be traders now.
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:51.280]  I mean, does that guy look like he's a chump or what?
[1:40:51.280 --> 1:40:56.280]  But then he acts like a big fat chump.
[1:40:56.280 --> 1:41:02.280]  Oh, thanks for joining us here on Reliable Creeper Van.
[1:41:02.280 --> 1:41:08.280]  It should be called here on Reliable Rape America Van, here on Reliable Creeps.
[1:41:08.280 --> 1:41:11.280]  We've already gang rapes you hard. We're not done.
[1:41:11.280 --> 1:41:14.280]  We take you, but put these handcuffs on and we'll go easy on you.
[1:41:14.280 --> 1:41:18.280]  Listen, put the handcuffs on. He's saying.
[1:41:18.280 --> 1:41:21.280]  So let's go back to put the handcuffs on and everything will be okay.
[1:41:21.280 --> 1:41:23.280]  That's the name of the show. Not reliable sources.
[1:41:23.280 --> 1:41:28.280]  I'm going to sit here and decide for the whole thing here. Let's start over.
[1:41:28.280 --> 1:41:31.280]  I just pumped the dog. Look, a guy. Here it is.
[1:41:31.280 --> 1:41:36.280]  Welcome back to Reliable Sources. I'm Brian Stelter live from Washington to DC today.
[1:41:36.280 --> 1:41:39.280]  Let's stop again. Back again. I'm Brian Stelter.
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:44.280]  I stilt the facts and I'm a con man. We're manipulating you and Alex Jones' opinion.
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:49.280]  I mean, look at this guy. I guarantee you this chump can't get women if he tried.
[1:41:49.280 --> 1:41:53.280]  He's got a million dollars on it. I mean, he's got a CNN job, a little nerd tie, all of it.
[1:41:53.280 --> 1:41:57.280]  This guy's a punk. This guy's an anti-American rat. This guy's an enemy.
[1:41:57.280 --> 1:41:59.280]  Let's go back to him.
[1:41:59.280 --> 1:42:04.280]  Welcome back to Reliable Sources. I'm Brian Stelter live from Washington to DC today.
[1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:07.280]  Oh, let's finish up the camera. We have a teleprompter.
[1:42:07.280 --> 1:42:12.280]  I'm live in DC. I'm in DC. That means I matter.
[1:42:12.280 --> 1:42:17.280]  I'm in DC. I'm in DC. I'm big. I'm mommy. Look at me on TV.
[1:42:17.280 --> 1:42:20.280]  I'm live for the big foreign Chinese government.
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:24.280]  Sorry. Let's back him up again. Start from the beginning. Sorry.
[1:42:24.280 --> 1:42:29.280]  Welcome back to Reliable Sources. I'm Brian Stelter live from Washington to DC today.
[1:42:29.280 --> 1:42:30.280]  All I have to do is...
[1:42:30.280 --> 1:42:36.280]  Come on. Back it up. Get it out. It's DC. District of Criminals. Get it out.
[1:42:36.280 --> 1:42:39.280]  He's the real man. Look at him. He's got his eyes kind of narrowed.
[1:42:39.280 --> 1:42:42.280]  He's kind of... I'm a CNN reporter.
[1:42:42.280 --> 1:42:50.280]  No one can stop him. Powerful, manly, and strong.
[1:42:50.280 --> 1:42:57.280]  He will teach you. Let's go back to Mr. Stilted on CNN. Here it is.
[1:42:57.280 --> 1:42:58.280]  Maybe you do too.
[1:42:58.280 --> 1:43:02.280]  Well, maybe. Oh, see, here's the psychology. I've got real issues with Trump.
[1:43:02.280 --> 1:43:07.280]  Maybe you do too. Maybe you're like me.
[1:43:07.280 --> 1:43:10.280]  Only folks you're getting is people that are near brain dead nursing homes, bro.
[1:43:10.280 --> 1:43:18.280]  I was in one a day. Ah, come to me. Oh, maybe you'll feel like me too.
[1:43:18.280 --> 1:43:22.280]  I mean, when you hear somebody going, oh, it's just all these tricks they use.
[1:43:22.280 --> 1:43:23.280]  Here, let's just go back to him.
[1:43:23.280 --> 1:43:26.280]  Deny reality on a daily basis.
[1:43:26.280 --> 1:43:30.280]  Back the whole thing up. I got to start from the beginning.
[1:43:30.280 --> 1:43:34.280]  Deny reality on a daily basis that Hillary was invincible, that could never be beaten,
[1:43:34.280 --> 1:43:39.280]  and was 50... CNN had polls where she was 50 points ahead of Trump.
[1:43:39.280 --> 1:43:42.280]  How the hell is that possible?
[1:43:42.280 --> 1:43:44.280]  Look at that little smiley punk face.
[1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:56.280]  All he's got is the little con man face. Like, keep it to it.
[1:43:56.280 --> 1:43:59.280]  That's what you see when you're chained up in the basement. The door opens. Here it comes.
[1:43:59.280 --> 1:44:00.280]  Let's continue.
[1:44:00.280 --> 1:44:06.280]  Welcome back to Reliable Sources. I'm Brian Stelter, live from Washington, D.C. today.
[1:44:06.280 --> 1:44:11.280]  All I have today are questions. Maybe you do too. Will President Trump...
[1:44:11.280 --> 1:44:14.280]  All I'm going to do is lie all day. I don't have questions. It isn't a question.
[1:44:14.280 --> 1:44:20.280]  He comes right out and says it's verifiably a lie that this is all scientific.
[1:44:20.280 --> 1:44:23.280]  He opens up an area of your brain that's of questions where you're open and looking.
[1:44:23.280 --> 1:44:26.280]  Then he tells you he's absolutely a fraud lying to you constantly.
[1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:31.280]  All of this is written by psych warfare chiefs, little chicken-necked psychiatrists behind the scenes,
[1:44:31.280 --> 1:44:34.280]  flapping their fingers, you know, hoping to screw America over,
[1:44:34.280 --> 1:44:38.280]  because they'll be manly someday if they can just dominate those big men they see at the grocery store
[1:44:38.280 --> 1:44:40.280]  and drive in those big trucks. They scare them.
[1:44:40.280 --> 1:44:44.280]  So, if I can just dominate the other men on the modern battlefield,
[1:44:44.280 --> 1:44:47.280]  here are my type of things they do. Here you go.
[1:44:47.280 --> 1:44:54.280]  They're so scared. Oh, God. I've got the Midwest men. I've got guns.
[1:44:54.280 --> 1:44:58.280]  Oh, God. Just all of it's about their manly. They dominate us.
[1:44:58.280 --> 1:45:00.280]  They're tough. They're cool. They're smart.
[1:45:00.280 --> 1:45:02.280]  Because the real men don't want to dominate anybody.
[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:04.280]  So, dominant can even handle all the victory.
[1:45:04.280 --> 1:45:06.280]  Meanwhile, being run over by parasites like you.
[1:45:06.280 --> 1:45:08.280]  Everything he says is to hurt you and your family.
[1:45:08.280 --> 1:45:10.280]  Here, back it up from the start again. I'm sorry.
[1:45:10.280 --> 1:45:12.280]  Welcome back to Reliable Sources.
[1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:16.280]  I'm Brian Stelter, live from Washington, DC today.
[1:45:16.280 --> 1:45:19.280]  All I have today are questions. Maybe you do too.
[1:45:19.280 --> 1:45:23.280]  Will President Trump deny reality on the other hand?
[1:45:23.280 --> 1:45:26.280]  Will he make up his own false facts and fake stats?
[1:45:26.280 --> 1:45:28.280]  If so, what will the consequences be?
[1:45:28.280 --> 1:45:32.280]  Oh, hey, pause. What will the consequences be for the president?
[1:45:32.280 --> 1:45:34.280]  They mean the American people that elected him.
[1:45:34.280 --> 1:45:38.280]  It's all about consequences. What do we do? How do we impeach him?
[1:45:38.280 --> 1:45:40.280]  How do we destroy him? Let's continue.
[1:45:40.280 --> 1:45:43.280]  Give up trying to fact check. Is that the goal?
[1:45:43.280 --> 1:45:46.280]  Oh, pause. Give up trying to fact check.
[1:45:46.280 --> 1:45:48.280]  That's because you've already given up. We already hate you.
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:50.280]  We already know you're a fraud.
[1:45:50.280 --> 1:45:53.280]  We're just putting a tombstone on the pile of manure. Go ahead.
[1:45:53.280 --> 1:45:55.280]  Down to wear us out.
[1:45:55.280 --> 1:45:59.280]  See, wear us out. They're trying to, how would I tell you?
[1:45:59.280 --> 1:46:01.280]  They're trying to break our will and wear us out.
[1:46:01.280 --> 1:46:06.280]  Do I look worn out, boy? You look worn out.
[1:46:06.280 --> 1:46:10.280]  I bet your family are a bunch of soft, cowardly, ugly-looking people.
[1:46:10.280 --> 1:46:12.280]  I don't mean that to be mean, but you know what?
[1:46:12.280 --> 1:46:16.280]  You want to wear us out? You look like a pile of dishonorable trash.
[1:46:16.280 --> 1:46:18.280]  People like you didn't found this country.
[1:46:18.280 --> 1:46:21.280]  You can't fight your way out of a what paper bag scumbag.
[1:46:21.280 --> 1:46:23.280]  It's why you went and found the most evil organization you could
[1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:27.280]  and groveled to it because weak people grovel at the altar of evil.
[1:46:27.280 --> 1:46:30.280]  Well, guess what? I don't. And I see you. Continue.
[1:46:30.280 --> 1:46:34.280]  Who at home trust? Who will you trust?
[1:46:34.280 --> 1:46:35.280]  Is this all accidental?
[1:46:35.280 --> 1:46:38.280]  Pause again. Who will you trust, this little creepy son of a bitch
[1:46:38.280 --> 1:46:41.280]  or your own gut and reality? Continue.
[1:46:41.280 --> 1:46:45.280]  Or is the Trump administration creating confusion and sowing division on purpose?
[1:46:45.280 --> 1:46:46.280]  Pause.
[1:46:46.280 --> 1:46:48.280]  Everything he says is what they're doing.
[1:46:48.280 --> 1:46:51.280]  Creating division, sowing distrust. That's in the WikiLeaks.
[1:46:51.280 --> 1:46:53.280]  How do we keep him desperate? How do we confuse him?
[1:46:53.280 --> 1:46:56.280]  The answer is cultural warfare. Yes, sir, yes, sir, yes, sir.
[1:46:56.280 --> 1:46:58.280]  That's the official WikiLeaks.
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:47:03.280]  So everything he's telling you, he now puts in a teleprompter that Trump's doing.
[1:47:03.280 --> 1:47:06.280]  Trump, we're unifying red blood as Americans coming together
[1:47:06.280 --> 1:47:09.280]  of every race, color, and creed for innovation in life.
[1:47:09.280 --> 1:47:12.280]  We'd all hire each other and work with each other and be loving and believing God.
[1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:14.280]  Meanwhile, Trump's trying to divide us.
[1:47:14.280 --> 1:47:16.280]  Here comes a million women screaming, he's an effing white male.
[1:47:16.280 --> 1:47:20.280]  All whites are bad, funded by this guy's bosses.
[1:47:20.280 --> 1:47:21.280]  Continue.
[1:47:21.280 --> 1:47:25.280]  The idea to force voters to choose between the reporters and the commander-in-chief
[1:47:25.280 --> 1:47:29.280]  to cast doubt on the media so much that you just give up and trust nothing.
[1:47:29.280 --> 1:47:30.280]  Pause again.
[1:47:30.280 --> 1:47:33.280]  Oh, yes, you just give up and trust nothing.
[1:47:33.280 --> 1:47:36.280]  Don't give up our few final viewers as the Gallup poll goes up for Trump.
[1:47:36.280 --> 1:47:40.280]  Don't give up. Come back to us because that's all there is is us.
[1:47:40.280 --> 1:47:43.280]  That's all there is is CNN and Joker Boy,
[1:47:43.280 --> 1:47:46.280]  reading off somebody else's teleprompter writing.
[1:47:46.280 --> 1:47:50.280]  Don't give up. Stay with us to believe in hope of unity.
[1:47:50.280 --> 1:47:52.280]  That's all we push is disunity, but it doesn't matter.
[1:47:52.280 --> 1:47:54.280]  Just don't give up. Continue, please.
[1:47:54.280 --> 1:47:56.280]  Is Trump gaslighting us?
[1:47:56.280 --> 1:47:58.280]  Oh, hit pause again.
[1:47:58.280 --> 1:48:02.280]  Oh my God, how many we have introduced the term in modern culture of gaslighting.
[1:48:02.280 --> 1:48:06.280]  It's when somebody punches you right in the nose and tells you they didn't do it.
[1:48:06.280 --> 1:48:08.280]  They tell you Obamacare is free when it's not.
[1:48:08.280 --> 1:48:10.280]  They tell you Hillary's gonna win.
[1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:12.280]  She's invincible when she was way behind.
[1:48:12.280 --> 1:48:15.280]  They tell you she's in the best shape of her life when she's dying.
[1:48:15.280 --> 1:48:17.280]  That's called gaslighting.
[1:48:17.280 --> 1:48:22.280]  It's called telling you that there aren't any IRS agents or penalties for Obamacare.
[1:48:22.280 --> 1:48:24.280]  Continue.
[1:48:24.280 --> 1:48:26.280]  Make you got your own eyes.
[1:48:26.280 --> 1:48:27.280]  Does he know what gaslighting means?
[1:48:27.280 --> 1:48:29.280]  Oh, hit pause. We don't have our own eyes.
[1:48:29.280 --> 1:48:32.280]  He's sitting here. He's sitting here saying what I was saying 20 years ago.
[1:48:32.280 --> 1:48:34.280]  You can see through them. You've got your own eyes.
[1:48:34.280 --> 1:48:36.280]  You know, they're a pack of liars.
[1:48:36.280 --> 1:48:38.280]  We're gonna stop them. They're gonna build a world government.
[1:48:38.280 --> 1:48:39.280]  They're gonna go after our families.
[1:48:39.280 --> 1:48:42.280]  Then they did everything I said. See, here's the difference, bro.
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:44.280]  We're right. You're wrong. What we say comes true.
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:46.280]  What you say doesn't. See how that works?
[1:48:46.280 --> 1:48:50.280]  I don't read off a teleprompter, little man.
[1:48:50.280 --> 1:48:52.280]  Keep going.
[1:48:52.280 --> 1:48:56.280]  Here's another question. Will Trump's staffers lie for him?
[1:48:56.280 --> 1:48:58.280]  Does Sean Spicer remember saying this?
[1:48:58.280 --> 1:49:00.280]  Hit pause.
[1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:02.280]  Here's another question.
[1:49:02.280 --> 1:49:05.280]  Will they lie for him implying he's this big liar and wants them?
[1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:10.280]  Like, here's another question. Is Trump raping his wife?
[1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:14.280]  Do you rape your wife often?
[1:49:14.280 --> 1:49:16.280]  Here's another question. Will they lie for him?
[1:49:16.280 --> 1:49:20.280]  There's no lying. He's bulldozing over your whole criminal and constitutional agenda.
[1:49:20.280 --> 1:49:23.280]  With drawing out a TPP, you name it. He's delivering.
[1:49:23.280 --> 1:49:26.280]  Your answer is, will they lie for him?
[1:49:26.280 --> 1:49:28.280]  Keep going.
[1:49:28.280 --> 1:49:30.280]  Oh, stop.
[1:49:30.280 --> 1:49:33.280]  That's them trying to get them to curry favor saying to Spicer and others.
[1:49:33.280 --> 1:49:36.280]  We'll make you big stars in MSM.
[1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:40.280]  Come to us. Come to the island of Arpies.
[1:49:40.280 --> 1:49:42.280]  Come to the siren song.
[1:49:42.280 --> 1:49:46.280]  Come to us on the river steaks. Get on the boat with Charon.
[1:49:46.280 --> 1:49:48.280]  Come to the loving land of dead media.
[1:49:48.280 --> 1:49:50.280]  Oh, never mind the skeleton faces.
[1:49:50.280 --> 1:49:54.280]  Just come, come, come, come, come as we fall and fail.
[1:49:54.280 --> 1:49:57.280]  We'll patch you on the head in a bubble in D.C.
[1:49:57.280 --> 1:49:59.280]  Make you feel like you're powerful.
[1:49:59.280 --> 1:50:04.280]  Trump's biggest problem is going to be infiltration and blackmail by globalist into his operation.
[1:50:04.280 --> 1:50:07.280]  That's going to be his main problem.
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:11.280]  And he will need a Praetorian Guard of people watching to stop that.
[1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:13.280]  Let's get the break on the cover of this.
[1:50:13.280 --> 1:50:16.280]  This is too important.
[1:50:16.280 --> 1:50:19.280]  Let's continue.
[1:50:19.280 --> 1:50:23.280]  The one thing that whether you're Republican, Democrat, independent, you have your integrity.
[1:50:23.280 --> 1:50:29.280]  I may tell a reporter I can't comment on something or, you know, I'm not going to say anything.
[1:50:29.280 --> 1:50:36.280]  Can we play Gibbs saying he was told to lie about the drone program that existed for five years and say it didn't exist?
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:40.280]  Because you're the ones that have this whole history of being discredited.
[1:50:40.280 --> 1:50:44.280]  Then they cut out a context of Spicer saying, I have my integrity.
[1:50:44.280 --> 1:50:46.280]  I may not comment on something.
[1:50:46.280 --> 1:50:48.280]  And then they're implying he's already lying.
[1:50:48.280 --> 1:50:50.280]  See, let's go.
[1:50:50.280 --> 1:50:52.280]  And I don't intend.
[1:50:52.280 --> 1:50:56.280]  I would argue that anybody who's an aspiring Republican,
[1:50:56.280 --> 1:51:00.280]  I don't intend, I would argue that anybody who's an aspiring...
[1:51:00.280 --> 1:51:03.280]  The post. See, they're trying to imply that Spicer's already lied.
[1:51:03.280 --> 1:51:06.280]  They've asked him about aspiring people and how they should be successful.
[1:51:06.280 --> 1:51:08.280]  He's telling them just about the code of ethics.
[1:51:08.280 --> 1:51:11.280]  They're implying this is a code of ethics because of Trump lying.
[1:51:11.280 --> 1:51:17.280]  So the first thing he does is, again, lie to you all because he has a head that looks like a donkey's wee-wee.
[1:51:17.280 --> 1:51:21.280]  Okay? And so that's his credibility. Here it is.
[1:51:21.280 --> 1:51:31.280]  The communicator adhere to that because if you lose the respect and trust of the press corps, you got nothing.
[1:51:31.280 --> 1:51:33.280]  You've got nothing, he says.
[1:51:33.280 --> 1:51:36.280]  So does Spicer have anything?
[1:51:36.280 --> 1:51:40.280]  Has he squandered all of the goodwill he's built up over the years?
[1:51:40.280 --> 1:51:44.280]  Or is there a chance to repair this relationship?
[1:51:44.280 --> 1:51:46.280]  Can he win back his credibility?
[1:51:46.280 --> 1:51:48.280]  All right, pause again.
[1:51:48.280 --> 1:51:52.280]  He's saying Trump doesn't have credibility, which he has total credibility with people that are thinkers.
[1:51:52.280 --> 1:51:55.280]  His support is expanding as he delivers his agenda.
[1:51:55.280 --> 1:52:01.280]  But this little nobody says, as if he's the authority up here as the big mommy dictating reality,
[1:52:01.280 --> 1:52:03.280]  will he win back his credibility?
[1:52:03.280 --> 1:52:06.280]  Will Trump, will Spicer, will you?
[1:52:06.280 --> 1:52:10.280]  You've been discredited when they're the ones that have been discredited.
[1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:13.280]  Again, everything he says is about himself.
[1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:17.280]  Everything he says is a fraud. Continue.
[1:52:17.280 --> 1:52:20.280]  This is all about credibility, after all.
[1:52:20.280 --> 1:52:22.280]  Take a look at what else Sean Spicer said.
[1:52:22.280 --> 1:52:25.280]  Again, this was a David Axelrod out at a university three weeks ago.
[1:52:25.280 --> 1:52:29.280]  Axelrod asked a very important question.
[1:52:29.280 --> 1:52:32.280]  Would you quit if you were asked to?
[1:52:32.280 --> 1:52:34.280]  It's not a question.
[1:52:34.280 --> 1:52:40.280]  I don't think any communicator with their salt can go out and tell a lie.
[1:52:40.280 --> 1:52:42.280]  You just, you can't do it.
[1:52:42.280 --> 1:52:47.280]  I think it's one thing for a surrogate to say something, or, and again, I'm not by any means advocating that.
[1:52:47.280 --> 1:52:51.280]  I think you have to, you can spin the way you want,
[1:52:51.280 --> 1:52:56.280]  but I think to go out and tell a lie is something that's just not acceptable.
[1:52:56.280 --> 1:52:58.280]  Now, let's stop.
[1:52:58.280 --> 1:53:00.280]  They say, can Trump, and everybody went back to credibility,
[1:53:00.280 --> 1:53:02.280]  Trump's a big liar, Trump's a deceiver.
[1:53:02.280 --> 1:53:04.280]  That's what Don Lemon, all of them are saying is the talking point.
[1:53:04.280 --> 1:53:07.280]  Then they asked Spicer, who's being real with them,
[1:53:07.280 --> 1:53:09.280]  hey, would you ever lie?
[1:53:09.280 --> 1:53:12.280]  And he says, no, I wouldn't.
[1:53:12.280 --> 1:53:16.280]  So it all implies that Trump is there lying.
[1:53:16.280 --> 1:53:19.280]  What are you doing going to all these events because you're a journalist
[1:53:19.280 --> 1:53:21.280]  and now you want to be cool in the journalism world?
[1:53:21.280 --> 1:53:25.280]  You're going to be cool, Spicer, by being as far away from them as you can be.
[1:53:25.280 --> 1:53:29.280]  It's uncool to be in all these clubs of really traitorous scumbag people.
[1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:36.280]  Info Wars is super successful and dominant because we are not of their system.
[1:53:36.280 --> 1:53:39.280]  Let's play Gibbs right now. Here it is.
[1:53:39.280 --> 1:53:42.280]  When I went through the process of becoming press secretary,
[1:53:42.280 --> 1:53:45.280]  one of the things, one of the first things they told me was,
[1:53:45.280 --> 1:53:47.280]  you're not even to acknowledge the drone program.
[1:53:47.280 --> 1:53:50.280]  You're not even to discuss that it exists.
[1:53:50.280 --> 1:53:55.280]  And so I would get a question like that and literally I couldn't tell you what Major asked
[1:53:55.280 --> 1:53:58.280]  because once I figured out it was about the drone program,
[1:53:58.280 --> 1:54:00.280]  I realized I'm not supposed to talk about it.
[1:54:00.280 --> 1:54:04.280]  But here's what's inherently crazy about that proposition.
[1:54:04.280 --> 1:54:11.280]  You're being asked a question based on reporting of a program that exists.
[1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:16.280]  So you're the official government spokesperson acting as if the entire program,
[1:54:16.280 --> 1:54:19.280]  pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:22.280]  I think in many ways, and I think what the president has seen,
[1:54:22.280 --> 1:54:25.280]  and I have not talked to him about this, I want to be careful, this is my opinion,
[1:54:25.280 --> 1:54:30.280]  but I think what the president has seen is our denial of the existence of the program
[1:54:30.280 --> 1:54:36.280]  when it's obviously happening undermines people's confidence overall
[1:54:36.280 --> 1:54:38.280]  and the decisions that their government makes.
[1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:39.280]  I think so.
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:40.280]  So here's the deal.
[1:54:40.280 --> 1:54:41.280]  You've got a whore media.
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:43.280]  That's not fair to whores.
[1:54:43.280 --> 1:54:48.280]  You've got a traitorous sellout media that will tell any lie and do anything
[1:54:48.280 --> 1:54:50.280]  that is totally destroyed in a general election,
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:54.280]  shooting everything they've got at Trump and the American people and failing,
[1:54:54.280 --> 1:54:59.280]  and then they have the Hutzpah, the bravada, whatever you want to call it,
[1:54:59.280 --> 1:55:06.280]  the arrogance, the hubris, the just crazy double down confidence game
[1:55:06.280 --> 1:55:12.280]  to then say Trump's done all this when Trump got elected being brazen and telling the truth
[1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:17.280]  and being naked in what he believes and being teleprompter free
[1:55:17.280 --> 1:55:19.280]  for almost all of his campaign.
[1:55:19.280 --> 1:55:20.280]  That's what they want.
[1:55:20.280 --> 1:55:24.280]  So you turn it all around after all your sellouts and all your lies
[1:55:24.280 --> 1:55:28.280]  and bring in the new press secretary weeks before he's in office.
[1:55:28.280 --> 1:55:32.280]  From three weeks ago and say the gotcha question,
[1:55:32.280 --> 1:55:35.280]  would you tell lies for Trump as if Trump's a liar?
[1:55:35.280 --> 1:55:36.280]  You know, I'm done with the piece.
[1:55:36.280 --> 1:55:37.280]  It just gets worse from here.
[1:55:37.280 --> 1:55:45.280]  I mean, these people are just absolutely despicable liars.
[1:55:45.280 --> 1:55:47.280]  And by the way, those aren't even strong enough words.
[1:55:47.280 --> 1:55:49.280]  These people are trash.
[1:55:49.280 --> 1:55:53.280]  I mean, these are empty, horrible people that would do anything,
[1:55:53.280 --> 1:55:54.280]  the powers that be told them.
[1:55:54.280 --> 1:55:55.280]  They're very dangerous people.
[1:55:55.280 --> 1:55:58.280]  These are your family's enemies.
[1:55:58.280 --> 1:55:59.280]  They want to make you poor.
[1:55:59.280 --> 1:56:01.280]  They see you as bitter clingers.
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:02.280]  They have it out for you.
[1:56:02.280 --> 1:56:03.280]  It's their ego.
[1:56:03.280 --> 1:56:04.280]  They're better than people.
[1:56:04.280 --> 1:56:08.280]  And they get off on Obamacare to impoverish you and call you dumb effers
[1:56:08.280 --> 1:56:10.280]  and thank God you're so stupid.
[1:56:10.280 --> 1:56:15.280]  Like a bunch of skexies laughing and that's all over jackasses.
[1:56:15.280 --> 1:56:20.280]  They'll still be evil fighting good, but humanity standing up.
[1:56:20.280 --> 1:56:21.280]  Feel it?
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:23.280]  You've been attacking a sleeping humanity.
[1:56:23.280 --> 1:56:26.280]  And boy, you were really proud of yourselves as a little apollies.
[1:56:26.280 --> 1:56:27.280]  Weren't you?
[1:56:27.280 --> 1:56:30.280]  But you're just at a bunch of little nobodies.
[1:56:30.280 --> 1:56:31.280]  So get ready.
[1:56:31.280 --> 1:56:37.280]  I hope you enjoy it because humanity and liberty is rising.
[1:56:37.280 --> 1:56:39.280]  A few points here.
[1:56:39.280 --> 1:56:40.280]  I got a hit.
[1:56:40.280 --> 1:56:41.280]  We are offering a deal.
[1:56:41.280 --> 1:56:43.280]  We haven't offered in six months.
[1:56:43.280 --> 1:56:44.280]  We don't do this a few times a year.
[1:56:44.280 --> 1:56:51.280]  Max 25% off all Alexa pure pro water filtration systems that cut all the garbage out to like
[1:56:51.280 --> 1:56:54.280]  999999 very best gravity fed systems out there.
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:56.280]  Simply amazing and their air filter.
[1:56:56.280 --> 1:56:57.280]  That's the real game changer.
[1:56:57.280 --> 1:56:59.280]  I had units that were $800 a piece in my house.
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:01.280]  This is as good or better.
[1:57:01.280 --> 1:57:02.280]  It's not good.
[1:57:02.280 --> 1:57:03.280]  The technology is getting.
[1:57:03.280 --> 1:57:04.280]  I bought those four years ago.
[1:57:04.280 --> 1:57:05.280]  I bought these starting last year.
[1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:07.280]  It's specs are amazing.
[1:57:07.280 --> 1:57:08.280]  Basically runs forever.
[1:57:08.280 --> 1:57:09.280]  Got to clean them out periodically.
[1:57:09.280 --> 1:57:11.280]  It is show incredible.
[1:57:11.280 --> 1:57:13.280]  We have the air filters of the water filters, 25% off.
[1:57:13.280 --> 1:57:17.280]  It's $149 for the air filter, $147 for the water filter.
[1:57:17.280 --> 1:57:19.280]  Similar air filters are $500.
[1:57:19.280 --> 1:57:21.280]  $100 now the price has gone down
[1:57:21.920 --> 1:57:28.640]  $800 similar water filters are still 250 300 ours is 147 blows away the comp attrition
[1:57:29.400 --> 1:57:30.800]  blows it away
[1:57:30.800 --> 1:57:34.920]  Again, I didn't have water filter sponsors for three four years because there weren't enough good ones
[1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:41.600]  We now have some really great sponsors, but I use personally in full war store.com in full wars life.com for the interstitials

[2:00:28.200 --> 2:00:31.840]  I know we loaded the phones up I started ranting something goes through your phone calls right now
[2:00:31.840 --> 2:00:33.840]  You get to talk to Roger stone coming up
[2:00:34.360 --> 2:00:36.640]  Mark and Chris and Roger and Vincent Tim and others
[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:41.880]  Mom's show at least 25 million dead and fraudulent registered voters in the 2016 election
[2:00:41.880 --> 2:00:48.320]  Because that's the reason that's big is that's the new election not Pew research on 2014 or
[2:00:49.240 --> 2:00:52.960]  2012 the general election that also ties into the new study
[2:00:53.720 --> 2:01:00.840]  With Hillary getting 800,000 illegals to vote for confirmed the same universities in a study in the last election before that and found
[2:01:01.480 --> 2:01:03.040]  2.8 million
[2:01:03.040 --> 2:01:08.560]  Voted so I mean Trump is just being proven absolutely correct. This is bombshell. It's a great job
[2:01:08.560 --> 2:01:13.800]  Kit Daniels getting that out. I mean, I just keep not finding fault with Trump except for torture and
[2:01:14.760 --> 2:01:18.200]  Then again, it's not his job to say we're gonna prosecute Hillary so he's stepping back
[2:01:18.200 --> 2:01:23.080]  I believe that will happen because it's the right thing to do and he is obsessed as they admit with delivering
[2:01:23.960 --> 2:01:30.880]  You heard it here first folks. Hillary is in deep doo doo. Let's go ahead and talk to callers here
[2:01:31.200 --> 2:01:35.320]  Let's talk to who's up first Chris in Ohio. You're on the year worldwide
[2:01:35.320 --> 2:01:41.440]  Hey Alex first, I want to say man, I want to thank you. I want to thank Roger Stone
[2:01:41.440 --> 2:01:47.080]  I want to thank Paul Watson for being on the tip of the spear and for the captain at the helm of this ship
[2:01:47.200 --> 2:01:53.840]  But we call freedom. There's nothing like what what's happening now and it's just an unbelievable time
[2:01:54.560 --> 2:02:00.640]  I am astounded and cannot believe what CNN is putting out there all their garbage their trash
[2:02:00.640 --> 2:02:08.240]  I mean, it's they've been doing it for so long that it feels so good to finally and by the way, they know they're traders
[2:02:08.240 --> 2:02:09.800]  It's in the WikiLeaks
[2:02:09.800 --> 2:02:14.600]  They know they want to make us desperate and poor and he's saying oh it Trump wants that what?
[2:02:16.520 --> 2:02:21.600]  Yeah, it makes absolutely no sense, you know and their audience are nothing but cookie-cutter zombies
[2:02:21.760 --> 2:02:25.160]  That that have been zombified into this Orwellian
[2:02:26.000 --> 2:02:29.400]  Technocratic style way of thinking to where these people they I mean
[2:02:29.400 --> 2:02:34.720]  It's like trying to shake them by their shoulders and scream wake up to these people and they can't seem to see it
[2:02:34.720 --> 2:02:40.840]  I mean, I saw you out there at the during the inauguration at the women's March and and these people
[2:02:41.480 --> 2:02:47.120]  That all they every time you made a point all they could do is say fuck you or all they could do is flip you off
[2:02:47.640 --> 2:02:51.680]  And it's so pathetic. No, I hear you. I gotta let you go because once we get the delay
[2:02:51.680 --> 2:02:53.200]  It's got a bill back up for our callers
[2:02:53.200 --> 2:02:59.680]  It's FCC stuff and we get penalized, but you know, you're a great caller and no, I mean I was there at the women's March and it was like
[2:02:59.680 --> 2:03:04.200]  Mainly white women. I'm not saying it to go easy on the minorities. I mean, it was me. It was white women
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:09.260]  In fact, I don't want to go easy. It was that was all it was screaming after you white male go to hell
[2:03:09.260 --> 2:03:11.260]  I hope you die and
[2:03:11.280 --> 2:03:15.200]  There's new video on info wars calm and I saw this myself if you're a minority a
[2:03:15.760 --> 2:03:21.640]  Black man or a Hispanic woman or something they frickin attack you and flip man. I mean, they don't know what to do
[2:03:21.640 --> 2:03:24.480]  You're like black or Hispanic or Asian. They start beating you up
[2:03:24.480 --> 2:03:30.360]  I keep seeing all these Hispanic and Asian women beat up bleeding a man if they saw one of them trying to get into a Trump
[2:03:31.040 --> 2:03:38.160]  Inauguration they had orders. There's a multiple checkpoints and they would just start attacking and hitting and it was just frothing because
[2:03:38.560 --> 2:03:41.660]  If minorities go in there and get hugged and accepted
[2:03:42.240 --> 2:03:44.920]  By a bunch of white people they're gonna go away. What's going on here?
[2:03:44.920 --> 2:03:48.720]  I thought they were all white supremacy inside there and they don't want those images on TV either
[2:03:48.720 --> 2:03:54.920]  We're gonna go to Roger in Texas and others when we come back and then of course Roger Stone's joining us
[2:03:55.280 --> 2:03:58.160]  But I will get to your calls early in the interview. I promise straight ahead
[2:03:59.040 --> 2:04:02.760]  But yeah, no, it's a crazy crazy crazy crazy crazy
[2:04:03.680 --> 2:04:09.240]  Time to be alive and they've been so racial in trying to say everybody's a racist that doesn't agree with their agenda
[2:04:09.240 --> 2:04:13.520]  That they become the very racist. They said they were fighting, but it was always like that
[2:04:13.960 --> 2:04:17.000]  It was Christians and blacks rebelling
[2:04:17.000 --> 2:04:21.080]  That ended slavery in this country and it was the Republicans and
[2:04:21.720 --> 2:04:27.040]  Might agree with everything Lincoln did. You know that turns sour as well. I say both sides were wrong with Civil War
[2:04:27.040 --> 2:04:29.360]  That's been declassified British intelligence manipulated it, but
[2:04:30.480 --> 2:04:35.240]  It was it was always Republicans and it was always Christians that did it and then they turn around and go
[2:04:35.240 --> 2:04:40.320]  Oh, the Republicans just passed Civil Rights Act in 58 and 60. What are we gonna do?
[2:04:40.320 --> 2:04:42.400]  Well, let's flip the claim we represent the minorities now
[2:04:42.400 --> 2:04:48.560]  And then the minorities bought it. So, you know, it's just it's just crazy
[2:04:49.480 --> 2:04:52.520]  And I'm not saying Republicans haven't played race politics, too. It's just that
[2:04:53.240 --> 2:04:58.040]  When you're when you're historically informed, it's very frustrating because stuff's upside down
[2:05:01.240 --> 2:05:05.240]  Headline Washington Times Trump argument bolstered Clinton received
[2:05:05.240 --> 2:05:13.680]  800,000 votes from non-citizens study finds in a study done by Jesse Richmond of Old Dominion University in Norfolk, Virginia
[2:05:13.680 --> 2:05:20.800]  He found that likely 6.4% of the estimated 20 million non-citizens of voting age living in the United States voted in the
[2:05:21.200 --> 2:05:24.440]  2016 presidential election the way he sees it this added
[2:05:25.640 --> 2:05:32.520]  843,000 votes for Clinton 81% of the non-citizen vote. So there it is again voter fraud proven to be happening another
[2:05:32.520 --> 2:05:39.460]  Independent study has found stacked that up with independent CBS investigation the Federalist John Gibbs investigation a
[2:05:39.920 --> 2:05:45.920]  Compilation of documented voter fraud it discover the networks.org and more to come. I'm sure remember just yesterday
[2:05:46.440 --> 2:05:52.440]  CNN USA Today and other mainstream media outlets claim Trump's claim of voter fraud was debunked
[2:05:54.240 --> 2:05:59.640]  Even fact-checked out org said it wasn't true. This is Owen shroyer for info wars calm

[2:08:30.640 --> 2:08:35.600]  Donald Trump didn't just change the presidency or the republic in seven days he changed the world
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:44.600]  I've got to say I'm so honored and I'm so blessed and I think my lucky star is that I've bet on Donald Trump more than two years ago
[2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:52.600]  And I'd met Roger Stone before but now he's a really good friend got to know him one of my favorite guests more and more going to be working with these broadcasts
[2:08:52.600 --> 2:08:57.600]  One with some other great journalists and folks who are going to be announcing in the near future
[2:08:57.600 --> 2:09:04.600]  This is an amazing time for every action. There's an equal and opposite reaction. That's Newtonian physics and we pretty much hit bottom
[2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:13.600]  Liberty is now exploding. A blitzkrieg of action. I agree with everything Trump's done except for torture and I had Ron Paul on
[2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:19.600]  He said no Trump's doing a great job on the economy trying to save it. The problem is central banks are now about to raise interest rates
[2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:24.600]  They're trying to head him off at the pass and stop the recovery and they admit they're doing that
[2:09:24.600 --> 2:09:32.600]  CNN and others are calling him a liar on three million illegals voting even though I have new studies that we've dug up
[2:09:32.600 --> 2:09:42.600]  Out of Old Dominion University in Virginia George Mason University from 2014 saying the election in the Senate was won by millions
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:48.600]  Upwards of three million illegals 2.8 million that they caught voting just in the states they looked at that is in a major study
[2:09:48.600 --> 2:09:56.600]  There's another study out by the same university just on this election finding that 800,000 voted for Hillary
[2:09:56.600 --> 2:10:03.600]  That's the Washington Times today but more importantly there's internal Democratic strategy memos that have come up last few years and even
[2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:14.600]  Politico illegal immigrants could elect Hillary. This is 2015 October 3rd Politico how non-citizens decreased Republican chances of winning the
[2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:24.600]  House next year. Now let's break that down. If California and Florida and New York and other states and have increased immigrant populations in them
[2:10:24.600 --> 2:10:34.600]  In the Electoral College and then that gets counted as higher Electoral College numbers and more House members but also a larger Electoral College
[2:10:34.600 --> 2:10:44.600]  Number that beats other states their vote even if they're not voting them being there via the census gets added in and the Democrats were betting on that
[2:10:44.600 --> 2:10:54.600]  And still they lost so Trump's number of 3 million is low. I already follow special report today more is coming out. It's up to you to get this out because they bet the farm
[2:10:54.600 --> 2:11:02.600]  Just like they did on fake polls on the fact that Trump didn't win the popular vote. He's right to say I did and to secure our election process
[2:11:02.600 --> 2:11:10.600]  I told you they'd federalize the election. They did it. I talked to people inside Homeland Security. I mean we have sources is even dangerous to talk about this
[2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:22.600]  I don't mean dangerous politically. I mean dangerous to my life. I've got sources where I'm like is it safe for me to be getting information from high level in U.S. intelligence agencies
[2:11:22.600 --> 2:11:30.600]  And they say oh everybody loves you Alex here. Here's the info. I'm not talking about Pachanic who has his sources as well. I mean
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:38.600]  Obviously I never tell about sources and people know they can trust me and they know I'm Americana but now in this whole new ballgame I can't believe the intel we get
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:45.600]  It's so accurate. Roger I know you want to get into fake news today and MSM and the type of distortions they're putting out and more
[2:11:45.600 --> 2:12:00.600]  But wow. Is Trump not delivering? This is dizzying the word that's being used. CNN said it's terrible. He's obsessed on doing what he said he'd do as his Gallup poll and Rasmussen polls go to 60%
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:12.600]  Absolutely Alex. Anybody who thought that Donald Trump was going to come to Washington and delete or download or sideline his agenda doesn't understand Donald Trump
[2:12:12.600 --> 2:12:24.600]  He is a very driven, focused and exceedingly stubborn person when he sets his mind to something and he understands the importance of sealing our borders
[2:12:24.600 --> 2:12:35.600]  He understands the importance of ending this flow of illegals into the country. He's not going to give an inch. He's actually going to do what he said he would do in the campaign
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:47.600]  How refreshing. How unusual. How American. So you know these minor flaps about his Twitter feed and how many people were at the inauguration versus Obama
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:59.600]  Meaningless really. He's delivering on the big picture items. So do you agree they're distracting us and I've taken the bait and so is he with the ridiculous lie of showing a photo from the monument when it first opened
[2:12:59.600 --> 2:13:06.600]  When we had the gigapixel showing was jam packed. I mean even though it's it's meant to be an outrageous lie to divert him and us
[2:13:06.600 --> 2:13:18.600]  Yeah, there's no question about that and CNN continues to lead the band in this regard. They continue to report things day and night that are simply not true fake news
[2:13:18.600 --> 2:13:26.600]  And then of course and we had this throughout the entire campaign. They turn around and accuse us of doing precisely what they are doing
[2:13:26.600 --> 2:13:39.600]  CNN is disgraceful. This is not a news organization. This is an ideological front. This is a propaganda machine. There's nothing wrong with that. That's how our American system works. They're allowed to spread propaganda
[2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:49.600]  Just don't claim to be a news organization and they're allowed to go bankrupt. So so so moving forward though I would give him a a plus simply incredible
[2:13:49.600 --> 2:13:58.600]  The CIA warmly welcomed him despite what we were told. I mean, this is devastating. What are the what are the top issues right now? Roger Stone
[2:13:58.600 --> 2:14:09.600]  Well, he's got a Supreme Court judge to pick. I think that's probably the most important thing on his mind at the moment with the strong support of Jeff sessions at his side
[2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:21.600]  He is moving ahead very aggressively on the immigration issue. He's very focused on infrastructure, which makes sense. Alex. He's a builder. That's what he does
[2:14:21.600 --> 2:14:30.600]  And he is searching for a way to finance the rebuilding of our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and our hospitals and our schools
[2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:40.600]  And it's very high on his agenda and he's not going to drop it because it's very important to him personally. This is a guy who can look at a bridge or can look at a building
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:49.600]  And say, wow, great architecture or wow, this thing's about to tip over. So infrastructure is never far from his mind or his agenda
[2:14:49.600 --> 2:15:02.600]  He's a doer. He's a man of enormous confidence and he is unsuayed by all these personal attacks. I just don't think he cares. He's there for four years at a minimum
[2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:07.600]  And he's going to fulfill as much of his agenda as he possibly can
[2:15:07.600 --> 2:15:19.600]  In a moment, I want to play a clip of the ABC quote first interview from the White House where the reporter tries to bring up the women's march funded by Soros and Islamic groups publicly. I couldn't believe that
[2:15:19.600 --> 2:15:27.600]  The Islamic part and he just ignores the women's march doesn't even tangle with them and take the bait to fight with women
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:41.600]  He says, oh, I love the pro life march coming up and now vice president Pence goes and speaks to it, which absolutely outrages them him following through the first vice president to speak at a pro life event
[2:15:41.600 --> 2:15:52.600]  Look, the president of the United States is pro life. Get used to it. The women's march and I have a slightly different take on this. I was there. I spoke to a number of the marchers
[2:15:52.600 --> 2:16:00.600]  I in fact had cocktails with them later in the evening. There are a lot of good sincere women there who are legitimately concerned about women's rights
[2:16:00.600 --> 2:16:11.600]  They're not haters. They're not attacking anybody. They have legitimate concerns. But unfortunately Alex, you put your finger on it. They were infected and infiltrated by agitators
[2:16:11.600 --> 2:16:25.600]  Most of them paid agitators carrying the nasty signs chanting the obscene chance and it gives everybody a bad name. It takes away the legitimacy of the people who are there for sincere reasons
[2:16:25.600 --> 2:16:37.600]  This didn't sway the president in any way. Believe me, he's very sensitive to women's health issues, largely because of his daughter Ivanka has made him sensitive to these issues
[2:16:37.600 --> 2:16:50.600]  So a flap about the women's march is neither here or there. Are we going to seal our borders? Are we going to renegotiate these trade deals? Are we going to make the country safer and more prosperous?
[2:16:50.600 --> 2:16:57.600]  I want to play this clip of ABC's mirror left speeches that the Trump brings up March for life. Here it is
[2:16:57.600 --> 2:17:08.600]  Let's do while we're standing outside. Could you hear the voices from the women's march here in Washington? We know there were more than a million people who turned out. And you are their president now too
[2:17:08.600 --> 2:17:09.600]  That's true
[2:17:09.600 --> 2:17:10.600]  Could you hear them from the White House?
[2:17:10.600 --> 2:17:19.600]  No, I couldn't hear them. But the crowds were large. But you're going to have a large crowd on Friday too, which is mostly pro-life people. You're going to have a lot of people coming on Friday
[2:17:19.600 --> 2:17:30.600]  And I will say this, and I didn't realize this, but I was told, you will have a very large crowd of people. I don't know, as large or larger. Some people said it's going to be larger, pro-life people
[2:17:30.600 --> 2:17:33.600]  And they say the press doesn't cover them
[2:17:33.600 --> 2:17:35.600]  I don't want to compare crowds sizes again
[2:17:35.600 --> 2:17:36.600]  No, you shouldn't
[2:17:36.600 --> 2:17:40.600]  But let me just say, what they do say is that the press doesn't cover them
[2:17:40.600 --> 2:17:41.600]  We saw
[2:17:41.600 --> 2:17:57.600]  So what's beautiful here is, he's bringing up the fact they always ignore pro-life or pro-gun marches. The president isn't going to do that. This is so beautiful how he's tying in and exciting his base and getting him to march more and getting him to be involved
[2:17:57.600 --> 2:18:00.600]  Republican presidents never do this
[2:18:00.600 --> 2:18:16.600]  Now, Donald Trump understands the value of the bully pulpit. He's using it every day. His nighttime tweeting is driving the mainstream media insane, therefore I would urge him, not that he needs any urging, to continue to speak his own mind
[2:18:16.600 --> 2:18:25.600]  Look, I've known Trump for 40 years. He is his own man. He's not taking stage directions from anyone else.
[2:18:25.600 --> 2:18:31.600]  He's getting good advice from the vice president and from senator sessions and a cross-section of people he's using
[2:18:31.600 --> 2:18:33.600]  And that's why the elite hate him. I want to ask this before you go to break
[2:18:33.600 --> 2:18:47.600]  Getting us out of TPP. He could have grabbed it like Obama did, held it, used it as a corporate tool of corporations to serve him. He didn't. He just withdrew, said it was negotiated secretly. The president can't do this and gave it back to Congress, killing it.
[2:18:47.600 --> 2:18:52.600]  I mean, he's devolving power back to the House, back to the Senate, back to the states
[2:18:52.600 --> 2:19:07.600]  That's because Donald Trump is entirely a man of his word. He told you what he's going to do and now he's doing it. It's a new thing for Washington. They've never seen this inside the Beltway before. They're in shock, to say the least
[2:19:07.600 --> 2:19:12.600]  I gotta say, Roger, he is over-delivering right now. I am pretty blown away
[2:19:12.600 --> 2:19:28.600]  Well, so far, so good. And over-delivering in the face of an overwhelming negative onslaught from some in the mainstream media. So kudos to him, but I don't expect this freight train to get sideline.
[2:19:28.600 --> 2:19:44.600]  I mean, the Trump train was kind of like Road Warrior running people over before, but at 10 miles an hour. Now, like a long drive up the football field, now it's like a bullet train that's just running everything over. This is almost too good to be true.
[2:19:44.600 --> 2:19:53.600]  I want to ask you about what you're worried about. Also, some of the media demonization, where we're going from here, the economy and more of the Roger Stone. His book, by the way, comes out in just a few days. We just got him in.

[2:22:27.600 --> 2:22:39.600]  Now I realize this is not dinner table conversation, but here goes anyway. One-world-way solved my irregularity. I've been plagued with constipation for years and I thought it would be that way for the rest of my life.
[2:22:39.600 --> 2:22:48.600]  Three weeks on one-world-way set me on a new path. That was five months ago and I haven't been irregular since. Will it work the same way for you? I don't know.
[2:22:48.600 --> 2:22:50.600]  It worked for me.
[2:23:18.600 --> 2:23:23.600]  Survival food is more important today than ever before, explains Frank Pates, a spokesman for the company.
[2:23:23.600 --> 2:23:29.600]  Natural disasters, terrorist attacks and other threats can make obtaining sufficient food impossible in an emergency.
[2:23:29.600 --> 2:23:44.600]  This 72-hour survival kit has 16 servings of delicious food, rated for 25 years of storage. It sells to the general public for $27 plus shipping and it's been rated four-and-a-half out of five stars by customers who paid full price.
[2:23:44.600 --> 2:23:54.600]  But listeners who act quickly can get it free, just cover $9.95 shipping. Go to freefood2.com right now. Supplies are limited and the program may end at any time.
[2:23:54.600 --> 2:24:17.600]  Go to freefood2.com now. That's freefood2.com.
[2:24:24.600 --> 2:24:38.600]  Get on board. It's the Trump train.
[2:24:38.600 --> 2:24:58.600]  Now we've got stones about 45 after I'm going to take a few of your calls to the next segment. This is a short segment. I don't want to be too optimistic, but optimism is what we need to get out of this global collapse.
[2:24:58.600 --> 2:25:09.600]  We now see the real axis of nationalism against the axis of globalism. The Communist Chinese openly in the news and at Davos saying, we're going to take over the media.
[2:25:09.600 --> 2:25:20.600]  We're going to take over Hollywood. We're going to bully the American people into submission. I sure hope next time you talk to the president, I know he's exposed this, or next time anybody talks to him, the listeners need to tweet him and talk to him.
[2:25:20.600 --> 2:25:29.600]  I hope he comes out and says, look, it's not the Russians doing this. The Chinese admittedly were involved in the election. Now they're in the newspapers saying they're going to take over Hollywood.
[2:25:29.600 --> 2:25:37.600]  They've got a new movie coming out with the Transformers director, where Trump's a dictator. I mean, Roger Stone, this is crazy.
[2:25:37.600 --> 2:25:55.600]  Well, they're manipulating those elements that they still control. Alex, you're absolutely right about the central banks. What they're really doing that's more egregious than anything is they're requiring the community banks to require a larger percentage of money down for builders.
[2:25:55.600 --> 2:26:12.600]  So people who want to build new housing and affordable housing is a giant problem in this country. They're being squeezed by the community banks at the direction of the central banks. They need to ease up and let them put down a more reasonable amount of money down.
[2:26:12.600 --> 2:26:20.600]  And Trump wants 0% basically with the general public that the banks have had for eight years, and they're saying no. In fact, we're going to raise rates basically on everybody.
[2:26:20.600 --> 2:26:28.600]  So they're trying to strangle the housing industry, which, as you know, is always the leading indicator of an economic revival.
[2:26:28.600 --> 2:26:41.600]  I can't tell you how many people in this industry have complained to me about this. And the president, fortunately, because he's a builder, because he's borrowed to build, he completely gets it. Stay tuned.
[2:26:41.600 --> 2:26:46.600]  Well, that's good news. So I guess if they come out and keep doing this, he's going to come out and expose what they're doing.
[2:26:46.600 --> 2:26:59.600]  But he understands the banks and lending and the construction industry like Donald Trump. He is first and foremost a builder. And he understands this is one of the keystones to moving this economy.
[2:26:59.600 --> 2:27:03.600]  And as he's already demonstrated, he's not afraid to take anybody on.
[2:27:03.600 --> 2:27:11.600]  That's right. George Washington was the founder. If Trump delivers, which I believe he will, he's going to be known as the builder.
[2:27:11.600 --> 2:27:17.600]  I like it. I think he would like it. Look, he has the potential to be one of our greatest presidents.
[2:27:17.600 --> 2:27:32.600]  The great danger is to be dissuaded by the sirens song of the Washington establishment who show up to kiss your ass, pretend they were for you while they're secretly moving to slow down or retard your agenda.
[2:27:32.600 --> 2:27:35.600]  These people exist. I saw a lot of them at the inaugural last week.
[2:27:35.600 --> 2:27:40.600]  Let's talk about that threat. Let's talk about the beautiful people of Potomac disease.
[2:27:40.600 --> 2:27:49.600]  Yeah, it's an inside the beltway phenomena. They like things just the way they are in the current Washington system.
[2:27:49.600 --> 2:27:53.600]  And I know I was a heavy duty lobbyist for a number of years. Money can buy.
[2:27:53.600 --> 2:27:57.600]  They said you were the biggest lobbyist for at least 15.
[2:27:57.600 --> 2:28:03.600]  Money in Washington up until Donald Trump came along, could buy anything.
[2:28:03.600 --> 2:28:10.600]  Donald Trump cannot be bought, doesn't need your money, doesn't want your money. And of course, he can't be bullied.
[2:28:10.600 --> 2:28:17.600]  This is why the inside the beltway K Street Wall Street Combine is so hysterical.
[2:28:17.600 --> 2:28:19.600]  Oh my God, a president we can't buy off.
[2:28:19.600 --> 2:28:22.600]  That's right. Their whole world is ending.
[2:28:22.600 --> 2:28:26.600]  I mean, we sent him there to blow up this tyranny. He's doing it.
[2:28:26.600 --> 2:28:28.600]  Well, and he's going to drain the swamp.
[2:28:28.600 --> 2:28:34.600]  Now, there are people who are going to try to talk him out of draining the swamp. We're going to try to explain why the swamp can't be drained.
[2:28:34.600 --> 2:28:40.600]  But they don't know Donald Trump. They don't know how focused and how driven he is.
[2:28:40.600 --> 2:28:45.600]  He wants to go down as a great president, but more importantly, he wants to make America great again.
[2:28:45.600 --> 2:28:50.600]  We're not lying to each other because we don't be too optimistic. His election is as big as 1776.
[2:28:50.600 --> 2:28:54.600]  If he delivers and even gets us out of this, he's going to be greater than George Washington.
[2:28:54.600 --> 2:28:58.600]  And I'm not just saying this. Historically, the world's bigger. It's crazier.
[2:28:58.600 --> 2:29:01.600]  If he can defeat all these evil forces with our help and support and our prayers.
[2:29:01.600 --> 2:29:04.600]  George, I mean, this, this is George Washington 2.0.
[2:29:04.600 --> 2:29:11.600]  But George Washington didn't have a hostile electronic media mummy dummies out there lying.
[2:29:11.600 --> 2:29:13.600]  No, an army of real men behind him.
[2:29:13.600 --> 2:29:15.600]  That's right. Real men.
[2:29:15.600 --> 2:29:23.600]  And Trump has, fortunately, the foot soldiers of the Trump Revolution, many of whom came to his candidacy through him forward.
[2:29:23.600 --> 2:29:28.600]  That's what I was about to say. It's we, the people that have to rally, defeat the globalists, get more involved than ever.
[2:29:28.600 --> 2:29:31.600]  If we go to sleep, Trump loses. If we energize the agenda, we win.
[2:29:31.600 --> 2:29:33.600]  Let's talk about that and some of the stuff we talked about this morning.
[2:29:33.600 --> 2:29:35.600]  Incredible lies are putting out against you particularly.
[2:29:35.600 --> 2:29:40.600]  They just illustrate how they deceive and twist and take some phone calls straight ahead with Roger Stone.
[2:29:40.600 --> 2:29:49.600]  I'm Alex Jones, and you are seeing the wrecking ball Donald Trump, like a huge mace, savage the head of Soros.
[2:29:49.600 --> 2:29:53.600]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[2:29:53.600 --> 2:30:19.600]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:19.600 --> 2:30:34.600]  We're on the march.
[2:30:34.600 --> 2:31:00.600]  We're on the march.
[2:31:00.600 --> 2:31:04.600]  Electrify your day with Secret 12. It's like lightning in a bottle.

[2:32:23.600 --> 2:32:27.600]  The bottom line, this is the book that got Roger Stone poisoned with polonium.
[2:32:27.600 --> 2:32:33.600]  It breaks down what really happened with the Russians and so much more, and it supports him and it supports Infowars in our whole operation.
[2:32:33.600 --> 2:32:38.600]  So it's essential that this book go to the top of the charts in the political area, if not to the very top of the charts.
[2:32:38.600 --> 2:32:41.600]  Joe Biden has come out and said world government is collapsing.
[2:32:41.600 --> 2:32:44.600]  They're in full crisis mode. National's movements are exploding.

[2:33:21.600 --> 2:33:24.600]  You know, I love this Alice Cooper song.
[2:33:24.600 --> 2:33:29.600]  Let's keep it rolling for a minute, because I used to be really nice on Air 27 years ago.
[2:33:29.600 --> 2:33:35.600]  I got no friends, because they read the papers.
[2:33:35.600 --> 2:33:45.600]  They can't be seen with me, and I'm feeling real shot down, and I'm feeling mean.
[2:33:45.600 --> 2:33:47.600]  No more.
[2:33:47.600 --> 2:33:52.600]  Hey, you want to be nasty media when you're nasty pals at garbage? I'm going to come after you.
[2:33:52.600 --> 2:33:56.600]  No more Mr. Nice Guy. I'm an overnight success. 25 years of making.
[2:33:56.600 --> 2:33:58.600]  I'm Alex Jones. This is the Infowar.
[2:33:58.600 --> 2:34:04.600]  And all I want to see is America succeed. I love flyover country. I love the East Coast to the West Coast.
[2:34:04.600 --> 2:34:07.600]  I love Michigan. I love Texas. I love Indiana. I love California.
[2:34:07.600 --> 2:34:10.600]  I love black people, Hispanics, whites, everybody else.
[2:34:10.600 --> 2:34:14.600]  I love the Easter Bunny. As long as he didn't try to rape me and my family.
[2:34:14.600 --> 2:34:17.600]  Yeah, I got no friends.
[2:34:17.600 --> 2:34:23.600]  In the establishment, and thank God they can't be seen with me.
[2:34:23.600 --> 2:34:26.600]  I don't want to be associated with them.
[2:34:26.600 --> 2:34:29.600]  I'm feeling mean.
[2:34:29.600 --> 2:34:34.600]  I'll take a few phone calls and a few other things with Roger. He's punching out and driving across town to a BBC interview.
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:38.600]  But it really is amazing. When I'm here with national TV, national radio, they come interview me.
[2:34:38.600 --> 2:34:41.600]  I do a few of them. They go, listen, we're really listeners. They got to do a hit piece.
[2:34:41.600 --> 2:34:45.600]  I'm sorry I got to do this, but it won't be too bad. But watch what you do, and they'll take it out of context.
[2:34:45.600 --> 2:34:50.600]  And they go, yeah, we're mercenaries. It's horrible. They almost pay us nothing now. It's all collapsing. You're absolutely right.
[2:34:50.600 --> 2:34:53.600]  Who are you? You got a job?
[2:34:53.600 --> 2:34:57.600]  So, I mean, they're running out of gas. We're exploding. They're imploding.
[2:34:57.600 --> 2:35:03.600]  And it's because we have goodwill for the average person, and folks know that we're reaching out and trying to empower humanity.
[2:35:03.600 --> 2:35:09.600]  Roger, I want to move quick to go to calls. As I promised, folks want to talk to you and talk about action against George Soros.
[2:35:09.600 --> 2:35:16.600]  Mark in Oregon has been holding before you got here during the break. I said, what do you want to cover next? You said, why isn't that a hole arrested?
[2:35:16.600 --> 2:35:19.600]  And you mentioned it. So someone, have you talked about that and then go to Mark?
[2:35:19.600 --> 2:35:29.600]  Yeah, look, I'm not an attorney, but I do know that paying people to advocate violence and assassination of an American president is against the law.
[2:35:29.600 --> 2:35:39.600]  George Soros is a was a Nazi collaborator. He's a criminal, have federal marshals go to wherever he is and pick him up.
[2:35:39.600 --> 2:35:44.600]  Have a friendly country extradite him, let him stand trial and pay the penalty.
[2:35:44.600 --> 2:35:47.600]  Yeah, let's send him to the Russians. They really like him.
[2:35:47.600 --> 2:35:51.600]  Yeah, look, if I think the Hungarians are going to get him first, this guy is a stone cold.
[2:35:51.600 --> 2:35:55.600]  Yeah, they had a million people marching hungry against him. The whole world gets, he's the guy.
[2:35:55.600 --> 2:36:05.600]  Right. So why hasn't he been arrested? I guarantee you that if there were some billionaire going around advocating the assassination of Barack Obama, he would have been detained.
[2:36:05.600 --> 2:36:20.600]  He would have been charged as he should have been. But for Soros to continue to this and to continue pouring money into the criminal David Brock, the money launderer, so he can continue to smear Trump is an outrage, just an outrage.
[2:36:20.600 --> 2:36:25.600]  Let's expand on that briefly. You were hit with polonium. They try to make jokes about it like who would want to do that?
[2:36:25.600 --> 2:36:32.600]  Well, they just blamed you for all the election. You're a Russian spy and you're behind WikiLeaks. So you're this evil mastermind that has to be arrested.
[2:36:32.600 --> 2:36:42.600]  Then you're poisoned. I guess you couldn't testify. Where are their hearings suddenly? You survived. Trump got in. Now they don't want, they have the hearings, do they, Roger?
[2:36:42.600 --> 2:37:00.600]  No, I think the hearings sounded me like they're off. So what's interesting to me, Alex, is in terms of trying to figure out who tried to kill me or who tried to poison me, it's a crime that'll never be solved simply because let's face it, there are way too many suspects.
[2:37:00.600 --> 2:37:12.600]  Well, I'm almost, I don't want to say jealous, but your Jan, John Hancock might be bigger than mine. The fact that they tried to kill you and not me. I mean, they've done some stuff to try to kill me before and attack me and try to kill my name.
[2:37:12.600 --> 2:37:17.600]  But you definitely have really get the grand prize and the fact that they tried to whack you, buddy.
[2:37:17.600 --> 2:37:29.600]  Well, next time I'll take a pass. Thanks. It's a horrific experience. Yeah, I'm aggravated by those in the mainstream media who say, oh, maybe this was a hoax by stone to sell.
[2:37:29.600 --> 2:37:40.600]  Your book almost didn't come out. You were in the hospital. You lost 10 pounds. You were delirious. A few times I called you and they're like, he can't even talk. I got on the phone once with you. You were like in La La Land. And this is not, this is not fake.
[2:37:40.600 --> 2:37:53.600]  I don't recommend it for weight loss. Let me put it to you that way. But the bad news for the establishment is I'm back. I'm strong. I'm on the mend. And I'm going to be writing and reporting on their four bills just as before.
[2:37:53.600 --> 2:38:11.600]  I'm happy to say Breitbart yesterday took an excerpt out of the making of the president 2016 got enormous readership. Big boost from info wars.com the book now available at the info wars website and I reiterate for anyone who buys the book at info wars.
[2:38:11.600 --> 2:38:23.600]  If they will email me just email me saying I bought the book at info wars. I'll believe you and I will send you a signed book plate that you can slap in the front of the book and now you've got an autograph book.
[2:38:23.600 --> 2:38:41.600]  Sure, if you want to send us a big stack of those two and we'll put those in there. But to be sure, I know we're not good about promotion. We're so busy. Send us the excerpts on Breitbart or we'll just copy it with a link to Breitbart and post that to info wars.com right now, the full excerpt with a link to buy the book at info wars store.com.
[2:38:41.600 --> 2:38:51.600]  I don't care if you get it Breitbart or anywhere else. By the way, we're all in this together and more of us makes us less of a target. I mean, my God, I want to explain to folks, Roger, you feel better.
[2:38:51.600 --> 2:39:02.600]  I'm there. You know, Bannon feels better. You're there. I'm there or or Joseph Farah or any of these, you know, or or Tucker has the daily caller. We feel good when Tucker gets promoted, not bad.
[2:39:02.600 --> 2:39:13.600]  We're not in competition with them. We're in competition with George Soros and the globalist. Now, maybe after we defeat them in the world's much better place, then you know, guys like to fight, we can then have some battle over who's dominant.
[2:39:13.600 --> 2:39:16.600]  But right now, the enemy is the globalist.
[2:39:16.600 --> 2:39:28.600]  I couldn't agree more. Look, I love Tucker Carlson's new show on Fox. I never miss it. I think he's terrific. He's a real patriot. He's a gutsy guy. And I'm proud to call him my friend.
[2:39:28.600 --> 2:39:36.600]  We're not in competition between any of these organs. So look, there are too few of us breaking through.
[2:39:36.600 --> 2:39:46.600]  This is the election where the tipping point was reached. ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and CNN. They lost their monopoly. We broke the back of their monopoly.
[2:39:46.600 --> 2:39:54.600]  And by the way, I've been watching their I've been watching their body language. They are on CNN MSNBC. They are genuinely panic. They're not acting panic.
[2:39:54.600 --> 2:40:02.600]  They look like they're waiting to get their pink slips. And the word is MSNBC and CNN are going to be sold off and basically just collapse.
[2:40:02.600 --> 2:40:15.600]  I don't see the AT&T Time Warner merger happening if Time Warner continues to own CNN. CNN is losing money, putting forward such talented geniuses as Don Lemon.
[2:40:15.600 --> 2:40:21.600]  No wonder they're losing money. It's a harangue. It's a constant negative harangue.
[2:40:21.600 --> 2:40:32.600]  They're very rarely anybody who's articulate to defend the administration or to defend President Trump. It's almost unwatchable. It's not even vaguely entertaining.
[2:40:32.600 --> 2:40:37.600]  But above all, it is not news. It is not in any way news.
[2:40:37.600 --> 2:40:44.600]  Meanwhile, Rudge broke all records last year and just broke those records there. Billions of visitors a month. This is insane.
[2:40:44.600 --> 2:40:58.600]  Well, and I see a promotion for a new special piece being anchored by Mike Smirkanish of on the President Trump and his results so far, his administration so far.
[2:40:58.600 --> 2:41:06.600]  Now Smirkanish is a very, very smart guy. I promoted him for a job in the Reagan administration where he served with distinction.
[2:41:06.600 --> 2:41:14.600]  So I'm going to be interested in seeing this piece and I'm only hopeful that it will be unbiased. It'll be honest.
[2:41:14.600 --> 2:41:20.600]  Well, here's the bottom line. Wars are fought with blood. They're also fought with money and we got great products. We got great books, great materials.
[2:41:20.600 --> 2:41:28.600]  If you don't buy the making of a President that is the blueprint of how we won, where we're going with the blueprint forward, stick the fork in it, we're done.
[2:41:28.600 --> 2:41:38.600]  I mean, it takes a lot of money to run this operation. Stone racing around the world, giving up a successful lobbying 15 years ago when he really had a moral crisis.
[2:41:38.600 --> 2:41:45.600]  And I say he was a bad guy. He's told me this personally. You know, and going out and fighting tyranny since then and exposing JFK assassination is a beautiful thing.
[2:41:45.600 --> 2:41:53.600]  1995 in hardcover, normally 2495. Buy it from M4store.com today. Recall toll free 8882533139.
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:42:00.600]  We'll take a call or two for you and you got to go and then finish up. But Stone in the 40 minutes we've been talking, any other tidbits you should add.
[2:42:00.600 --> 2:42:05.600]  No, I think you'd have to watch the Supreme Court nomination very, very carefully.
[2:42:05.600 --> 2:42:11.600]  I like how you know what's going on. I mean, I know I've heard from other sources as well. You're like, we have to watch very carefully.
[2:42:11.600 --> 2:42:18.600]  Yeah. You know, I think Donald Trump could have as many as four appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court.
[2:42:18.600 --> 2:42:26.600]  That means that he could be a transformative president as opposed to a transitional president. This is, this is really epic.
[2:42:26.600 --> 2:42:34.600]  And I think that his first appointment is going to give us some key to what the other appointments will be. This is the unique opportunity.
[2:42:34.600 --> 2:42:37.600]  This is what we fought over in the last election.
[2:42:37.600 --> 2:42:44.600]  Well, I mean, isn't it already decided that he said it's decided, you know, I mean, he's going to go with the list he said he was, even though we don't know.
[2:42:44.600 --> 2:42:49.600]  I mean, I heard through the grapevine from some other people that there's somebody who'd really be even better.
[2:42:49.600 --> 2:42:52.600]  But I don't know how he didn't get on the first list. I wish he did.
[2:42:52.600 --> 2:42:56.600]  Well, look, I respect and support whoever the president chooses.
[2:42:56.600 --> 2:42:57.600]  I agree.
[2:42:57.600 --> 2:43:03.600]  People are very solid. I do think he'll have greater latitude in his second and third, maybe fourth appointment.
[2:43:03.600 --> 2:43:07.600]  But he's going to remake the court. And when you remake the court, you remake the country.
[2:43:07.600 --> 2:43:15.600]  Sure, that's the way he's delivered on everything. We'll see what happens in the Supreme Court. But I mean, you can see he is obsessed with delivering because he wants to be a purist.
[2:43:15.600 --> 2:43:16.600]  I'm very excited.
[2:43:16.600 --> 2:43:19.600]  Let's take a call or two and then Roger's got a gun to drive across town for maybe seniority.
[2:43:19.600 --> 2:43:23.600]  Mark, I want to you first is you before Roger was on raise action against George Soros.
[2:43:23.600 --> 2:43:27.600]  Look, he's a horrible, evil person that obviously overthrows governments and does violent things.
[2:43:27.600 --> 2:43:30.600]  I don't want to pick a fight with him to act tough for the audience.
[2:43:30.600 --> 2:43:36.600]  But as a man, I have to say, you know, I mean, how much we have to put up with from this guy. Go ahead.
[2:43:36.600 --> 2:43:42.600]  Yes. Kudos, Roger and Alex to my heroes.
[2:43:42.600 --> 2:43:53.600]  Roger is truly great to hear you sounding at least as vital and strong as you've ever been a full recovery. Godspeed.
[2:43:53.600 --> 2:43:59.600]  I truly believe that the making of a president will be number one on all book list.
[2:43:59.600 --> 2:44:09.600]  It will be number one for a long, long time. The evil ones have read your book covertly and tried with polonium to block its ever seeing the light of day.
[2:44:09.600 --> 2:44:13.600]  Sure. And he almost didn't get it written. And exactly.
[2:44:13.600 --> 2:44:20.600]  I have about a one minute statement. I'd like to go ahead. I think it's extremely important.
[2:44:20.600 --> 2:44:30.600]  The top globalist will, if they're allowed to, assassinate Donald Trump and or begin a civil war in America and or start a world war.
[2:44:30.600 --> 2:44:33.600]  As of course, you both are fully aware.
[2:44:33.600 --> 2:44:45.600]  The necessary move to make now that the enemies of mankind are fully exposed is to utilize the police, the intelligence and the militaries of the world,
[2:44:45.600 --> 2:44:53.600]  which are pro-liberty and are ready and willing to engage in a gathering up operation,
[2:44:53.600 --> 2:45:01.600]  which will arrest the first, second and third levels of the Illuminati, the ones such as Soros and Rothschild,
[2:45:01.600 --> 2:45:10.600]  and the backup and operational command and control which operate beneath the top level of command.
[2:45:10.600 --> 2:45:20.600]  It's easily proven on the court of law that these miscreants have committed many and various crimes against humanity with no command and control.
[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:28.600]  In this evil organization, the only ones left will be those whose sole function has been to take and implement the orders given.
[2:45:28.600 --> 2:45:31.600]  Mark, Mark, that's a one minute statement or more. Let me just say this.
[2:45:31.600 --> 2:45:36.600]  As long as your process is done, but I agree with you. And so does Roger Soros has committed huge crimes.
[2:45:36.600 --> 2:45:41.600]  That was Hillary everybody. Look how Trump's only delivering. He can't say I'm going to prosecute her. That's not his place.
[2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:45.600]  The fact that he's recused himself by saying, oh, I hope that doesn't happen.
[2:45:45.600 --> 2:45:53.600]  I had a gut level believe he won't stand in the way of sessions who's already says he will recuse himself, not if, but when she's indicted.
[2:45:53.600 --> 2:45:55.600]  Thanks for the call, Mark. Roger Stone.
[2:45:55.600 --> 2:45:59.600]  Yeah, I think your caller is exactly right. I can tell you this, Alex.
[2:45:59.600 --> 2:46:09.600]  I struggled money between a nonprofit and a political action committee and the various other fronts, millions and millions of dollars as David Brock has done.
[2:46:09.600 --> 2:46:16.600]  I'd be in jail right now. Wasn't the lesson of Watergate that no person, no matter how elite was above the law.
[2:46:16.600 --> 2:46:20.600]  So the law should be applied to the entire Soros gang.
[2:46:20.600 --> 2:46:24.600]  No, we're not talking about detaining people because we disagree with their political views.
[2:46:24.600 --> 2:46:28.600]  We're talking about detaining and trying people because they have broken the law.
[2:46:28.600 --> 2:46:32.600]  I'm not a crook. I'm not a crook.
[2:46:32.600 --> 2:46:38.600]  One standard must be one standard. Let's go to another call. Let's go to another call.
[2:46:38.600 --> 2:46:43.600]  Let's do it. Let's talk to Roger in Texas. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[2:46:43.600 --> 2:46:47.600]  Alex, thank you. This is Roger. You're Indian American caller. Long time.
[2:46:47.600 --> 2:46:55.600]  I report on everything to do with radical Islam in Texas and I've been a follower of Roger Stone.
[2:46:55.600 --> 2:46:59.600]  Awesome. Let me just say this. I was at the Women's March trying to get out of town.
[2:46:59.600 --> 2:47:03.600]  I mean, it was there covering for like three hours. It was run by Islamics.
[2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:10.600]  They were handing out a jibs to women and then it was in the news it was run by Muslims and Islamists and this weird group connected to Hamas.
[2:47:10.600 --> 2:47:20.600]  So I'm asking, since when do the women groups, and I'll go back to you caller Roger Stone, sit there and openly be run by Islamists when that's the most oppressive group to women anywhere, Roger?
[2:47:20.600 --> 2:47:33.600]  Yeah, let's be very clear. Radical Islam does not allow women to appear in public without their veil, to choose their own husbands, to own property, to vote, to travel without the permission of their husbands.
[2:47:33.600 --> 2:47:41.600]  And if a woman is raped in an Islamic country, she will be stoned to death and the rapists will be held not responsible.
[2:47:41.600 --> 2:47:47.600]  Is that what our feminists want? Let's ask Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem. Do you like that? Do you like that system?
[2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:53.600]  Because that's what you're supporting. But it's crazy. It's like it's not real. It's like satire.
[2:47:53.600 --> 2:48:02.600]  Madeline Albright, let's queue it up if we can. Came out in this short clip. She tweeted it too. She said, I want to join Islam now.
[2:48:02.600 --> 2:48:08.600]  I'm joining Islam because we're being mean to Islam. No, we're not. I mean, it's crazy.
[2:48:08.600 --> 2:48:12.600]  Roger, in Texas, your question for Roger. Go ahead.
[2:48:12.600 --> 2:48:24.600]  So Alex, I was Alex and Roger. So yesterday, I was at a historic hearing by the Texas Homeland Security Forum called Defending Against Radical Islamic Tourism in Texas.
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:32.600]  And this should have been reported by the mainstream media, not just nationally, but locally as well, which Roger knows how corrupt they are.
[2:48:32.600 --> 2:48:34.600]  And you know as well, Alex.
[2:48:34.600 --> 2:48:44.600]  Go ahead and report on it. Go ahead. No, they did not. And this was hosted by Representative Biderman and Lieutenant Colonel Roy White.
[2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:50.600]  And they had experts and former Muslims and current Muslims. Sure. So what were they covering? The plan to take over?
[2:48:50.600 --> 2:49:04.600]  Yeah, so they sent questions to care and 400 Islamic organizations saying, OK, do you agree that the Constitution supersedes Sharia law? That's it. Nobody replies.
[2:49:04.600 --> 2:49:12.600]  No, that's right. All the major Islamic groups won't decry terror, won't decry overthrowing the Constitution, won't decry conquering America.
[2:49:12.600 --> 2:49:18.600]  So that's it. You're incompatible. No. And I don't care if you were a Muslim, if you did want to overthrow the damn country.
[2:49:18.600 --> 2:49:26.600]  Roger Stone, great point. Hey, don't matter, Roger. Shoot your own video, put it on YouTube. We'll pick it up. Don't count on the media to cover it. You are the media, Roger Stone.
[2:49:26.600 --> 2:49:39.600]  That's exactly right. We all remember back during the campaign when you had this father of an Iraq war veteran speaking at the Democratic Convention criticizing Trump for his disregard for the Constitution.
[2:49:39.600 --> 2:49:50.600]  Is this guy kidding? He believes in Sharia law. He had written himself that Sharia was superior to the Constitution. So who's bullshitting who?
[2:49:50.600 --> 2:50:03.600]  It's an outrage, but you won't find that covered or mentioned on CNN or CBS. It doesn't exist. They don't report it. You're exactly right. We've broken the monopoly. Go online.
[2:50:03.600 --> 2:50:12.600]  Take your own video. Cover your hearings. Folks, if you want to destroy CNN and NBC and ABC and all of them, go out and put it on YouTube.
[2:50:12.600 --> 2:50:20.600]  You'll get thousands of hundreds of thousands of millions of views. Start your own news organization. Do it. You want to be perfect? Just do it. Please destroy them. Please.
[2:50:20.600 --> 2:50:25.600]  I'm begging you. I want competition. Make me obsolete. Please. I just want to beat them. Please, please, please.

[2:54:15.600 --> 2:54:44.600]  I love this part of the show where we get to take calls from the real Americans to see what's on their minds. So let's go to the show.
[2:54:44.600 --> 2:54:48.600]  Let's go to Vince in Illinois. Vince, what's on your mind?
[2:54:48.600 --> 2:54:54.600]  Hello, Roger. I've been a long time listening to Alex Jones. I was there in the beginning when he first started.
[2:54:54.600 --> 2:54:56.600]  Did we lose Vince?
[2:54:56.600 --> 2:55:07.600]  I have real fears about if the deep state does assassinate or take out Donald Trump, how can this train keep on rolling? How can we make sure that...
[2:55:07.600 --> 2:55:14.600]  I'm not sure what we have here, folks, but...
[2:55:14.600 --> 2:55:16.600]  Vince in Illinois?
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:18.600]  Can you hear me, Roger?
[2:55:18.600 --> 2:55:39.600]  We've been talking until we straighten our technical problems out. As Alex said, the making of the President 2016, how Donald Trump orchestrated an American Revolution and took on the New World Order, will be mailed from Amazon, from Sky Horse by publisher, from Barnes & Noble on Saturday.
[2:55:39.600 --> 2:55:53.600]  This is a definitive look about how Donald Trump was able to take on the mass media and take advantage of the rise of alternative media, Infowars, Breitbart, Daily Caller, and others.
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:56:03.600]  And in this new media mix, how he challenged the American establishment across the board to win the greatest single upset in U.S. political history.
[2:56:03.600 --> 2:56:22.600]  I have said, and I say again, if you buy your book from Infowars.com on the Infowars store, I will send you a personally autographed book plate to put in the front of the book, and you will have a signed copy of what I believe will be a New York Times bestseller and a historical book.
[2:56:22.600 --> 2:56:29.600]  So I urge you to go to the Infowars.com store and order your copy today.
[2:56:29.600 --> 2:56:42.600]  I must also say that we are very pleased today, when I went outside to pick up the mail, my order of DNA force has arrived.
[2:56:42.600 --> 2:56:47.600]  Now, Infowars store was out of this for a small period of time.
[2:56:47.600 --> 2:56:59.600]  Fortunately, I had enough stock, so I didn't miss anything, but let us now go to Tim in Illinois, but folks, DNA force back in the store.
[2:56:59.600 --> 2:57:03.600]  Thank you, Roger, and I popped out with a family call, but I'm here as great heavy cut hosting. Tim, go ahead, you're on air.
[2:57:03.600 --> 2:57:13.600]  Good afternoon, gentlemen. I have a great idea that I was hoping you could forward to President Trump for me. That can be a death blow to both of these things that we're talking about today.
[2:57:13.600 --> 2:57:24.600]  You know, since 1985, it's only been illegal for two countries to do direct-to-consumer advertising with pharmaceutical drugs.
[2:57:24.600 --> 2:57:34.600]  Now, a week or so ago, John Rappaport said that approximately 70% of the budgets for these organizations is from big pharma.
[2:57:34.600 --> 2:57:44.600]  So, how about a tasty little executive order that makes it illegal again to advertise prescription drugs on television?
[2:57:44.600 --> 2:57:50.600]  That is incredible. That would kill MSM overnight. Wow. That is an absolute sort of damocles over their head.
[2:57:50.600 --> 2:57:53.600]  Thank you, Tim. Roger Stone, your comments in closing.
[2:57:53.600 --> 2:58:03.600]  Very clearly, Donald Trump is prepared to take on big pharma. They have been living a privileged and exclusive life under the previous administrations.
[2:58:03.600 --> 2:58:08.600]  So, Trump is very concerned about getting effective medicines to the people.
[2:58:08.600 --> 2:58:11.600]  Look at RFK Jr. Look at RFK Jr. in the vaccines.
[2:58:11.600 --> 2:58:15.600]  Yeah, epic. Absolutely epic. And Trump's not going to back down.
[2:58:15.600 --> 2:58:22.600]  He wants an investigation and a full report on vaccines and whether they are hurting people.
[2:58:22.600 --> 2:58:26.600]  All right, Roger. Thank you for all the time getting the car and rush over to that BBC interview.
[2:58:26.600 --> 2:58:31.600]  I know it's coming up soon. Again, thestoneculture.com or mfolwars.com. Thank you, Roger.
[2:58:31.600 --> 2:58:33.600]  On my way. Thanks. All right, folks. Thank you.
[2:58:33.600 --> 2:58:37.600]  A fourth hour coming up. I'm going to intro it with David Knight.
[2:58:37.600 --> 2:58:40.600]  So, stay with us at mfolwars.com forward slash show.
[2:58:40.600 --> 2:58:43.600]  If your station doesn't carry the fourth hour, stay with us. We'll be back.
[2:58:43.600 --> 2:59:02.600]  Visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:59:13.600 --> 2:59:16.600]  All right, guys. Thank you for joining us today.
[2:59:16.600 --> 2:59:21.600]  We'll be back with a full report on this mechanism right now with all the refugees spreading disease around.
[2:59:21.600 --> 2:59:25.600]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[2:59:25.600 --> 2:59:28.600]  Tell us about all the stuff. There's so many things that are in it.
[2:59:28.600 --> 2:59:32.600]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[2:59:32.600 --> 2:59:35.600]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[2:59:35.600 --> 2:59:38.600]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[2:59:38.600 --> 2:59:41.600]  It just came back in yesterday. Living Defense, mfolwarslife.com.
[2:59:41.600 --> 2:59:44.600]  And you support the broadcast, mfolwarslife.com.
[2:59:44.600 --> 2:59:46.600]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[2:59:46.600 --> 3:00:12.600]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[3:00:12.600 --> 3:00:19.600]  It's Alex Jones coming to you now from the front lines of the InfoWare.
[3:00:19.600 --> 3:00:20.600]  All right, David.
[3:00:20.600 --> 3:00:21.600]  The ninth session is fourth hour.
[3:00:21.600 --> 3:00:24.600]  I'm going to coast about 20-something minutes with him here today.
[3:00:24.600 --> 3:00:25.600]  I want to continue with the phone calls.
[3:00:25.600 --> 3:00:26.600]  I promise to get to everybody.
[3:00:26.600 --> 3:00:30.600]  Greg and Dan and Jason, Vincent, Ron.
[3:00:30.600 --> 3:00:35.600]  But David is cozy with me in the shower and I'll be gone in about 20 minutes.
[3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:40.600]  We were talking in the hallway if you want to repeat some of the statements you were making to me.
[3:00:40.600 --> 3:00:42.600]  David's not there yet.
[3:00:42.600 --> 3:00:43.600]  I wanted to bring him in.
[3:00:43.600 --> 3:00:47.600]  David was saying in the hallway, man, Trump has really knocked it out of the park.
[3:00:47.600 --> 3:00:49.600]  Yeah, I'm going to coast with him, sir, by nose.
[3:00:49.600 --> 3:00:51.600]  So really knocked it out of the park.
[3:00:51.600 --> 3:00:55.600]  Very, very exciting time for all of us to be alive.
[3:00:55.600 --> 3:00:58.600]  I mean, look, if something's negative, I'll tell you all day long, they said I'm the king of negative.
[3:00:58.600 --> 3:01:03.600]  Well, you got Bush and then Obama and the Clintons before him and Herbert Walker and all this criminality.
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:05.600]  It just got worse and worse and worse.
[3:01:05.600 --> 3:01:11.600]  And now you're seeing stuff that's known to help workers, known to help people, known to get the economy going,
[3:01:11.600 --> 3:01:17.600]  known to help people being given dangerous vaccines, securing our border, building infrastructure,
[3:01:17.600 --> 3:01:19.600]  pulling us out of foreign takeovers like TPP.
[3:01:19.600 --> 3:01:23.600]  I mean, it's just hard to find fault.
[3:01:23.600 --> 3:01:26.600]  It's very, very hard to find fault with Trump.
[3:01:26.600 --> 3:01:28.600]  It really is.
[3:01:28.600 --> 3:01:29.600]  Let's go to Dan in New Mexico.
[3:01:29.600 --> 3:01:32.600]  Dan, thanks for holding it on the air.
[3:01:32.600 --> 3:01:33.600]  Yeah.
[3:01:33.600 --> 3:01:37.600]  Sure, you want to screen your call or we're going to go on air?
[3:01:37.600 --> 3:01:39.600]  Hello?
[3:01:39.600 --> 3:01:42.600]  Yeah, Dan, you want to mean to screen your call or you want to be on air?
[3:01:42.600 --> 3:01:43.600]  I mean, it's cool either way.
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:44.600]  What would you like to do?
[3:01:44.600 --> 3:01:45.600]  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[3:01:45.600 --> 3:01:46.600]  I'm here.
[3:01:46.600 --> 3:01:47.600]  I'm here.
[3:01:47.600 --> 3:01:48.600]  I'm here.
[3:01:48.600 --> 3:01:49.600]  I wanted to bring up a couple of things.
[3:01:49.600 --> 3:01:52.600]  It's too bad I missed Roger.
[3:01:52.600 --> 3:01:56.600]  But tomorrow is the anniversary of the meeting that never happened.
[3:01:56.600 --> 3:02:00.600]  Levois Finneken, who got gunned down on his way to a meeting.
[3:02:00.600 --> 3:02:03.600]  The Bundy's are still in jail in Nevada.
[3:02:03.600 --> 3:02:07.600]  They can certainly use a pardon from President Trump.
[3:02:07.600 --> 3:02:13.600]  There's also a 77-year-old Navy veteran who is rotting in jail in Nevada.
[3:02:13.600 --> 3:02:19.600]  He's from Montana for building a stockpond on his property with full approval from
[3:02:19.600 --> 3:02:22.600]  the Army Corps of Engineers, full approval from the...
[3:02:22.600 --> 3:02:23.600]  No, no.
[3:02:23.600 --> 3:02:24.600]  Then he got arrested.
[3:02:24.600 --> 3:02:27.600]  So people are tired out west of being harassed and Trump's cutting down those agencies and
[3:02:27.600 --> 3:02:28.600]  going after those folks.
[3:02:28.600 --> 3:02:29.600]  That's a great point.
[3:02:29.600 --> 3:02:30.600]  I appreciate your call.
[3:02:30.600 --> 3:02:33.600]  Let me bring in David Knight with his take on that.
[3:02:33.600 --> 3:02:34.600]  I know that's near and dear to his heart.
[3:02:34.600 --> 3:02:37.600]  He covered the whole situation out in Oregon.
[3:02:37.600 --> 3:02:40.600]  The situation, of course, out in Nevada as well.
[3:02:40.600 --> 3:02:44.600]  All historic with Obama targeting him and shooting up the vehicle.
[3:02:44.600 --> 3:02:47.600]  And now the guy that shot up the vehicle, I think, has been indicted, correct?
[3:02:47.600 --> 3:02:49.600]  I'm not sure about that, Alex.
[3:02:49.600 --> 3:02:51.600]  I don't think they've indicted the guy that...
[3:02:51.600 --> 3:02:53.600]  I don't have a criminal investigation going unless I'm a herdhead.
[3:02:53.600 --> 3:02:54.600]  Well, they did.
[3:02:54.600 --> 3:02:58.600]  They found that initially they had lied about not shooting the car.
[3:02:58.600 --> 3:03:00.600]  They found the bullets that belonged to the police.
[3:03:00.600 --> 3:03:05.600]  But Alex, I hope that he also pardons the Hammons, the people that the Bundy's went to Oregon
[3:03:05.600 --> 3:03:09.600]  to try to help because they were victims of an out of control bureaucracy that tried to
[3:03:09.600 --> 3:03:13.600]  set them up as terrorists and say that they were arsonist for doing something that was
[3:03:13.600 --> 3:03:17.600]  far less than the EPA or the Bureau of Land Management or the Forestry Service did on
[3:03:17.600 --> 3:03:18.600]  a routine basis.
[3:03:18.600 --> 3:03:22.600]  That was setting a backfire to stop a fire that was going to wipe out their property.
[3:03:22.600 --> 3:03:25.600]  So that was one of the things that began the Oregon situation.
[3:03:25.600 --> 3:03:29.600]  And of course, Alex, as we saw at the very end of the Obama administration, it was the
[3:03:29.600 --> 3:03:34.600]  EPA that was running through massive amounts of legislation rules at...
[3:03:34.600 --> 3:03:38.600]  It's not legislation, it's rules that they come out with at the very last minute.
[3:03:38.600 --> 3:03:42.600]  And I'm very encouraged to see Donald Trump push back against the EPA.
[3:03:42.600 --> 3:03:46.600]  I've got a story here we're going to talk about the person who was on the transition team
[3:03:46.600 --> 3:03:49.600]  for the Environmental Protection Agency said he would like to see Donald Trump start with
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:52.600]  a 50% cut in personnel at the EPA.
[3:03:52.600 --> 3:03:55.600]  I would like to see that as well move on from there to 100% cut.
[3:03:55.600 --> 3:04:02.600]  But Alex, we've also seen rumors that Donald Trump is considering pardoning this individual
[3:04:02.600 --> 3:04:07.600]  who was sent to jail for taking a couple of pictures in the submarine that he had served
[3:04:07.600 --> 3:04:11.600]  and those pictures would be classified no higher than confidential.
[3:04:11.600 --> 3:04:17.600]  And of course, it was a really egregious example of the dual standard when Hillary Clinton gets off.
[3:04:17.600 --> 3:04:21.600]  Sure, so how does Hillary get away with things 10,000 times worse but this guy goes to jail?
[3:04:21.600 --> 3:04:22.600]  Absolutely.
[3:04:22.600 --> 3:04:24.600]  And there's also cases, I'm not defending everything, blackwaters.
[3:04:24.600 --> 3:04:28.600]  There have been cases where blackwater was being shot at under State Department contracts
[3:04:28.600 --> 3:04:33.600]  and shot back and people were sent to life in prison for that as well.
[3:04:33.600 --> 3:04:35.600]  I mean, you send them to war and you do this.
[3:04:35.600 --> 3:04:39.600]  Let's come back and get your view on what you told me in the hall of Trump
[3:04:39.600 --> 3:04:45.600]  and his whirlwinds first seven days straight ahead and more phone calls
[3:04:45.600 --> 3:04:48.600]  and then I'm going to punch you out of here at 20 after and let David Knight take over.
[3:04:48.600 --> 3:04:51.600]  I'm Alex Jones and this is The Info War.
[3:04:51.600 --> 3:04:54.600]  Spread that link, folks. They do not like it out there.
[3:04:54.600 --> 3:04:57.600]  And when you take action, nothing on earth can stop you.
[3:04:57.600 --> 3:05:19.600]  So again, I want to thank you all.
[3:05:28.600 --> 3:05:31.600]  So there it is again, voter fraud proven to be happening.
[3:05:31.600 --> 3:05:36.600]  Another independent study has found stacked that up with independent CBS investigation,
[3:05:36.600 --> 3:05:41.600]  the Federalist John Gibbs investigation, a compilation of documented voter fraud
[3:05:41.600 --> 3:05:44.600]  at discoverthenetworks.org and more to come, I'm sure.
[3:05:44.600 --> 3:05:49.600]  Remember, just yesterday, CNN, USA Today and other mainstream media outlets
[3:05:49.600 --> 3:05:54.600]  claimed Trump's claim of voter fraud was debunked.
[3:05:54.600 --> 3:06:00.600]  Even factcheck.org said it wasn't true. This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.
[3:06:25.600 --> 3:06:31.600]  Plus, you can take it with you to jumpstart cars, trucks, buses, 18-wheelers, heavy equipment, even airplanes.

[3:08:10.600 --> 3:08:12.600]  Put up with some big lies.
[3:08:12.600 --> 3:08:18.600]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[3:08:18.600 --> 3:08:28.600]  Riding on the highway, going to a show.
[3:08:31.600 --> 3:08:38.600]  Riding on the highway, going to a show.
[3:08:38.600 --> 3:08:41.600]  Stopping on the far away.
[3:08:41.600 --> 3:08:49.600]  Getting ready in rock and roll. Getting high.
[3:08:49.600 --> 3:08:51.600]  Getting beat up.
[3:08:51.600 --> 3:08:54.600]  Broken bones.
[3:08:54.600 --> 3:08:56.600]  Getting took.
[3:08:56.600 --> 3:09:05.600]  I'm here to tell you, it's harder than it looks, until you reach the tipping point.
[3:09:05.600 --> 3:09:10.600]  In the beginning, it's hard to find a patriot, but not later.
[3:09:10.600 --> 3:09:12.600]  There's nothing to be a patriot.
[3:09:12.600 --> 3:09:16.600]  We're far from that point yet, but we're a lot closer than when I started or Ron Paul started,
[3:09:16.600 --> 3:09:19.600]  or very Goldwater started, or right back to Thomas Jefferson,
[3:09:19.600 --> 3:09:22.600]  and right back to the Magna Carta, and Francis Bacon, and all the rest of it.
[3:09:22.600 --> 3:09:24.600]  Going back to David Knight and your phone calls in this segment,
[3:09:24.600 --> 3:09:26.600]  and he's got a lot to cover.
[3:09:26.600 --> 3:09:29.600]  One of our wonderful sponsors, I don't talk enough about,
[3:09:29.600 --> 3:09:32.600]  has been with us off and on for 15, 16 years, and Solutions from Science.

[3:09:43.600 --> 3:09:46.600]  But they give us some of the biggest sponsorship out there, I mean,
[3:09:46.600 --> 3:09:50.600]  where you can get one of their units at the regular price, and then the other one free.
[3:09:50.600 --> 3:09:54.600]  As long as they raise the price of one unit and sell the next, you know, for nothing.
[3:09:54.600 --> 3:09:57.600]  No, they really cut the prices.
[3:09:57.600 --> 3:10:01.600]  Solutions from Science has the next generation of PPX model available.
[3:10:01.600 --> 3:10:03.600]  This new model has 60% more power.

[3:11:04.600 --> 3:11:06.600]  That's how crazy this is.
[3:11:06.600 --> 3:11:10.600]  And we have water filtration systems from Alexa Pure and air filtration systems 25% off.
[3:11:10.600 --> 3:11:12.600]  We only do that a few times a year.
[3:11:12.600 --> 3:11:17.600]  It's been six months since we did that last 25% off on both at infowarstore.com.
[3:11:17.600 --> 3:11:19.600]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[3:11:19.600 --> 3:11:21.600]  David, I want to take a few calls and get out of here,
[3:11:21.600 --> 3:11:24.600]  but I promise to go to these collars just while I'm loitering.
[3:11:24.600 --> 3:11:26.600]  I appreciate you hosting the fourth hour.
[3:11:26.600 --> 3:11:30.600]  Could you repeat to me the conversation we had in the hall about two hours ago,
[3:11:30.600 --> 3:11:31.600]  because it was pretty good stuff.
[3:11:31.600 --> 3:11:36.600]  Well, you know, Alex, I told you, I really thought that Trump had had a magnificent weekend.
[3:11:36.600 --> 3:11:37.600]  Your word was out of the park.
[3:11:37.600 --> 3:11:38.600]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:11:38.600 --> 3:11:41.600]  And I wasn't with Trump at the beginning, because I'm very cynical.
[3:11:41.600 --> 3:11:45.600]  I don't believe people, I've seen so many politicians, especially Republicans,
[3:11:45.600 --> 3:11:48.600]  who will say one thing, they get elected, they do something completely different.
[3:11:48.600 --> 3:11:53.600]  When I realized, the first time I started paying attention to Trump was when I realized that 30 plus years ago,
[3:11:53.600 --> 3:11:59.600]  he had spent his own money to take out ads in the New York Times about these trade issues that he was passionate about.
[3:11:59.600 --> 3:12:01.600]  And I thought, well, maybe this guy's for real.
[3:12:01.600 --> 3:12:02.600]  I had seen him honestly.
[3:12:02.600 --> 3:12:03.600]  That's what made him so mad.
[3:12:03.600 --> 3:12:05.600]  He gave money and they would even do what they said they did.
[3:12:05.600 --> 3:12:10.600]  Yeah, I had seen him honestly give the very first debate question that came out there, that first debate.
[3:12:10.600 --> 3:12:15.600]  Brett Barrett said, you know, are you going to just fall in line behind the other people if you lose?
[3:12:15.600 --> 3:12:17.600]  And he goes, well, I might not.
[3:12:17.600 --> 3:12:18.600]  You know, he honestly answered that.
[3:12:18.600 --> 3:12:19.600]  I respected that as well.
[3:12:19.600 --> 3:12:26.600]  But you know, Alex, this last week has taken it to the next level because the way that CNN put it, Alex,
[3:12:26.600 --> 3:12:32.600]  they said that his determination to keep his campaign promises verges on obsession.
[3:12:32.600 --> 3:12:34.600]  And I thought that's pretty amazing for CNN to say that.
[3:12:34.600 --> 3:12:37.600]  It's almost like CNN is saying to Trump, yeah, it's okay.
[3:12:37.600 --> 3:12:40.600]  You don't need to do what you said you were going to do.
[3:12:40.600 --> 3:12:42.600]  It's okay to lie to the American people.
[3:12:42.600 --> 3:12:43.600]  We do it all the time.
[3:12:43.600 --> 3:12:46.600]  All the professional politicians, either people, all the time.
[3:12:46.600 --> 3:12:49.600]  This is how Donald Trump changed the presidency in seven days.
[3:12:49.600 --> 3:12:52.600]  And they say, you don't have to do it.
[3:12:52.600 --> 3:12:55.600]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't do it.
[3:12:55.600 --> 3:12:57.600]  Yeah, because they do it all the time.
[3:12:57.600 --> 3:12:58.600]  They lie to us all the time.
[3:12:58.600 --> 3:12:59.600]  Their politicians lie to us all the time.
[3:12:59.600 --> 3:13:01.600]  By the way, he's not verging on an obsession.
[3:13:01.600 --> 3:13:07.600]  Becoming president uphill, like a, you know, a salmon swimming upstream is an obsession.
[3:13:07.600 --> 3:13:08.600]  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[3:13:08.600 --> 3:13:10.600]  So he's done a lot in the first week.
[3:13:10.600 --> 3:13:15.600]  And it's interesting to see what the mainstream media says Politico's got their take on it.
[3:13:15.600 --> 3:13:16.600]  It was huge week one.
[3:13:16.600 --> 3:13:18.600]  And I thought it was kind of interesting.
[3:13:18.600 --> 3:13:22.600]  They looked at some of the many, many things, very long articles, some of the many things that he did.
[3:13:22.600 --> 3:13:26.600]  And I thought it was really funny what they thought was important and what they didn't think was important.
[3:13:26.600 --> 3:13:30.600]  It was very much from their political perspective, things like, oh, counting the crowd size.
[3:13:30.600 --> 3:13:32.600]  Oh, that's really going to be big.
[3:13:32.600 --> 3:13:38.600]  But of course, shutting down mandates for Obamacare, taking actions on the border.
[3:13:38.600 --> 3:13:39.600]  Not so much that.
[3:13:39.600 --> 3:13:42.600]  So it's kind of interesting to see how they react to it.
[3:13:42.600 --> 3:13:47.600]  But Alex, these had a great week and I got to say, I truly respect what he's done.
[3:13:47.600 --> 3:13:50.600]  I truly respect somebody who has kept their promises.
[3:13:50.600 --> 3:13:57.600]  I didn't see Ronald Reagan keep his promises to this degree in eight years while Donald Trump has done in eight days.
[3:13:57.600 --> 3:13:59.600]  And I really respect that.
[3:13:59.600 --> 3:14:00.600]  Well, I agree with you.
[3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:01.600]  I'm going to try to pull it up.
[3:14:01.600 --> 3:14:04.600]  It's such a long article I read it this morning and found that I can't find it in the article.
[3:14:04.600 --> 3:14:08.600]  It's a long transcript where they say it's bordering on obsession.
[3:14:08.600 --> 3:14:09.600]  It's dangerous.
[3:14:09.600 --> 3:14:10.600]  Yeah.
[3:14:10.600 --> 3:14:14.600]  They're just normalized lying, normalized us accepting fraud.
[3:14:14.600 --> 3:14:19.600]  But the determination to keep campaign promises is verging on obsession inside the Trump White House.
[3:14:19.600 --> 3:14:21.600]  Oh, my God, cut the debt.
[3:14:21.600 --> 3:14:26.600]  You get more jobs, bring jobs back, cut the middle class and poor people's taxes.
[3:14:26.600 --> 3:14:31.600]  Get rid of real estate, write-offs and incentives and subsidies.
[3:14:31.600 --> 3:14:35.600]  I mean, he just is, he's, that'll lower housing prices for poor people.
[3:14:35.600 --> 3:14:39.600]  Those close to president believe that despite the upward and washing the actions are being well received.
[3:14:39.600 --> 3:14:42.600]  Well, look at his Gallup polls and others that are even skewed.
[3:14:42.600 --> 3:14:45.600]  Still, he's surging like a rocket.
[3:14:45.600 --> 3:14:47.600]  CJ, who's a smart guy.
[3:14:47.600 --> 3:14:49.600]  And I agree with him in the control room.
[3:14:49.600 --> 3:14:50.600]  I think they're going to try to kill Trump.
[3:14:50.600 --> 3:14:52.600]  I really think they're used to power their arrogant.
[3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:53.600]  Everything else has failed.
[3:14:53.600 --> 3:14:55.600]  I think that's the main threat.
[3:14:55.600 --> 3:14:56.600]  I agree.
[3:14:56.600 --> 3:14:57.600]  I agree.
[3:14:57.600 --> 3:15:00.600]  I mean, you look at somebody that Donald Trump admired that was President Andrew Jackson.
[3:15:00.600 --> 3:15:02.600]  He came against the central bank.
[3:15:02.600 --> 3:15:03.600]  Trying to kill him six times.
[3:15:03.600 --> 3:15:04.600]  Trying to kill him.
[3:15:04.600 --> 3:15:05.600]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:15:05.600 --> 3:15:06.600]  Yeah.
[3:15:06.600 --> 3:15:07.600]  So, you know, absolutely they will.
[3:15:07.600 --> 3:15:09.600]  Look, there's so much money and power involved.
[3:15:09.600 --> 3:15:11.600]  Of course, they'll do that type of thing.
[3:15:11.600 --> 3:15:13.600]  They'll overthrow entire countries.
[3:15:13.600 --> 3:15:15.600]  They'll kill a half a million children in Iraq.
[3:15:15.600 --> 3:15:19.600]  And then when you ask Madeleine Albright about it, she'll say that was worth it.
[3:15:19.600 --> 3:15:21.600]  So, yeah, they'll do anything like that.
[3:15:21.600 --> 3:15:22.600]  So he better be very careful.
[3:15:22.600 --> 3:15:25.600]  He got secret service agent who says, hey, I wouldn't take a bullet for him.
[3:15:25.600 --> 3:15:26.600]  I'm not going to do anything to protect him.
[3:15:26.600 --> 3:15:29.600]  I mean, that person should not be in that position.
[3:15:29.600 --> 3:15:31.600]  And the media spends that like we say the secret service wants to kill him.
[3:15:31.600 --> 3:15:33.600]  They did that when I said that the other day.
[3:15:33.600 --> 3:15:34.600]  No, there are a lot of good people there.
[3:15:34.600 --> 3:15:35.600]  They leaked it.
[3:15:35.600 --> 3:15:36.600]  Hillary was so sick to us.
[3:15:36.600 --> 3:15:38.600]  The thing is, they know there's moles in there.
[3:15:38.600 --> 3:15:39.600]  Yeah.
[3:15:39.600 --> 3:15:40.600]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:15:40.600 --> 3:15:42.600]  And if you're not going to do your job, and if you're not going to take it seriously,
[3:15:42.600 --> 3:15:46.600]  and she's talking about, hey, you know, I really don't want to do my job,
[3:15:46.600 --> 3:15:48.600]  then you shouldn't be there.
[3:15:48.600 --> 3:15:50.600]  If you're not going to use that kind of diligence, yeah.
[3:15:50.600 --> 3:15:54.600]  Trump is a true, we can say now, he is a 1776 champion reborn.
[3:15:54.600 --> 3:15:56.600]  This is all our hopes and prayers.
[3:15:56.600 --> 3:15:57.600]  He's clearly for real.
[3:15:57.600 --> 3:15:58.600]  He's not perfect.
[3:15:58.600 --> 3:15:59.600]  He's so real.
[3:15:59.600 --> 3:16:00.600]  He admits some things that are bad.
[3:16:00.600 --> 3:16:01.600]  We don't like, but he's real.
[3:16:01.600 --> 3:16:02.600]  This is it.
[3:16:02.600 --> 3:16:03.600]  Yeah.
[3:16:03.600 --> 3:16:06.600]  There's some things that I wish that he would focus on civil liberties.
[3:16:06.600 --> 3:16:09.600]  You know that we've talked about torture, other things like that.
[3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:12.600]  And we disagree with them on some issues, but we have honest disagreements.
[3:16:12.600 --> 3:16:16.600]  We always have a chance with somebody who is honest to try to convince them.
[3:16:16.600 --> 3:16:22.600]  And as I said before, I think it's a good thing for him to see the dishonesty of the intelligence agencies coming at him.
[3:16:22.600 --> 3:16:25.600]  He gets to experience how rogue elements that are doing that to him.
[3:16:25.600 --> 3:16:26.600]  Yes.
[3:16:26.600 --> 3:16:28.600]  A few calls and I'm going to skip this break so David has more time.
[3:16:28.600 --> 3:16:29.600]  Let's talk to Greg in California.
[3:16:29.600 --> 3:16:30.600]  You're on the air.
[3:16:30.600 --> 3:16:31.600]  Go ahead.
[3:16:31.600 --> 3:16:33.600]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:16:33.600 --> 3:16:35.600]  David, you three quick comments.
[3:16:35.600 --> 3:16:43.600]  I'll make sure I make it quick because I may never speak to you again, but I'm out here in California and I worked with the resistance fighting corruption in the local union.
[3:16:43.600 --> 3:16:46.600]  You know, I fell out here to ran for business manager.
[3:16:46.600 --> 3:16:54.600]  And anyway, that's, I know there's quiet souls of every race, color and creed with red blood that are fighting for liberty everywhere.
[3:16:54.600 --> 3:17:03.600]  We, we tried to try to fight union corruption and we lost the election, even with the department of labor and held the police being caught educating them in the process.
[3:17:03.600 --> 3:17:04.600]  You'll win the war.
[3:17:04.600 --> 3:17:05.600]  Yes, sir.
[3:17:05.600 --> 3:17:06.600]  Yes, sir.
[3:17:06.600 --> 3:17:09.600]  So real quick, I think there's two topics that we need to discuss and focus on.
[3:17:09.600 --> 3:17:13.600]  Number one is the wall and the potential for bullet train.
[3:17:13.600 --> 3:17:15.600]  And the second is the deep state.
[3:17:15.600 --> 3:17:20.600]  So topic number one, and I would like both of you to comment on each of these if you could for me.
[3:17:20.600 --> 3:17:25.600]  You have inspired me to create a WordPress and a YouTube channel called Alt Feed.
[3:17:25.600 --> 3:17:26.600]  So thank you very much.
[3:17:26.600 --> 3:17:29.600]  I'm in the fight with you guys and I really appreciate all you do.
[3:17:29.600 --> 3:17:41.600]  So regarding the wall and Mexico pushing back, if the, if the top of it has two tracks, one for Mexico to use for transport and one for us to use for transport, that's a great deal.
[3:17:41.600 --> 3:17:54.600]  If we made the interior of the wall hollow and put a high speed cargo train inside, we could also potentially put in a port in the Gulf of Mexico and move cargo and goods and services from the Gulf of Mexico to the West.
[3:17:54.600 --> 3:17:55.600]  That's a great idea.
[3:17:55.600 --> 3:18:02.600]  Actually, you should pitch that at Trump to turn it into an actual industrial bill for legal and lawful commerce.
[3:18:02.600 --> 3:18:18.600]  And everybody knows they take control of ports and make it, make it commerce wide, then it would be like a jobs creator all along the rails, railway, you know, stops along it and legal citizens from both sides could get on the train and either go to New Mexico, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, or California.
[3:18:18.600 --> 3:18:19.600]  That's a great idea.
[3:18:19.600 --> 3:18:22.600]  It's an immigration entry where people are vetted properly.
[3:18:22.600 --> 3:18:23.600]  We're not trying to keep people out.
[3:18:23.600 --> 3:18:24.600]  We're trying to keep.
[3:18:24.600 --> 3:18:25.600]  It's a great point.
[3:18:25.600 --> 3:18:26.600]  Keep it up, brother.
[3:18:26.600 --> 3:18:27.600]  I got to jump.
[3:18:27.600 --> 3:18:31.600]  But since you, you know, raise all that, that's the type of stuff Trump's talking about.
[3:18:31.600 --> 3:18:32.600]  They go, oh, we don't have the money.
[3:18:32.600 --> 3:18:37.600]  It's believing in industry and building something that humans use that actually builds culture.
[3:18:37.600 --> 3:18:40.600]  The globalists admit they want to destroy normal human culture.
[3:18:40.600 --> 3:18:47.600]  They siphon trillions a year off to go to derivatives that are not even existent to destroy our wealth.
[3:18:47.600 --> 3:18:51.600]  They create fiat, which is fine as long as it empowers humanity.
[3:18:51.600 --> 3:19:00.600]  They create fiat, then they siphon it off into a black hole transmuting our real energy into fake digits and then destroying it.
[3:19:00.600 --> 3:19:06.600]  So they're involved in basically black magic, destroying our productivity to make us controllable.
[3:19:06.600 --> 3:19:10.600]  That's the essence of globalism is that it's the anti-free market.
[3:19:10.600 --> 3:19:11.600]  It's the anti-prosperity.
[3:19:11.600 --> 3:19:12.600]  David Knight.
[3:19:12.600 --> 3:19:13.600]  Yeah, Alex.
[3:19:13.600 --> 3:19:21.600]  In terms of, in terms of infrastructure projects, I would like to see the path where the federal government reduces its footprint instead of increasing it.
[3:19:21.600 --> 3:19:27.600]  That they don't pick who the winners and losers are going to be, that they let the American people in the States take that.
[3:19:27.600 --> 3:19:30.600]  Maybe they'll force a coalition aside to build the road.
[3:19:30.600 --> 3:19:31.600]  That's right, sure.
[3:19:31.600 --> 3:19:32.600]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:19:32.600 --> 3:19:36.600]  And keep it close to the people instead of having Washington centrally plan the economy.
[3:19:36.600 --> 3:19:38.600]  That's the thing that we have to watch out for two things.
[3:19:38.600 --> 3:19:41.600]  When we build infrastructure, we don't want a centrally planned economy.
[3:19:41.600 --> 3:19:43.600]  That's what Russia failed on.
[3:19:43.600 --> 3:19:52.600]  And we don't want to have a situation where you've got foreign corporations, large corporations who come in and wind up owning our infrastructure like we're seeing with toll road situations.
[3:19:52.600 --> 3:19:54.600]  And that's your big concern with Trump.
[3:19:54.600 --> 3:19:59.600]  I mean, he hasn't done this yet, but we've got to watch that Centra and others don't come in and control the monopoly process.
[3:19:59.600 --> 3:20:00.600]  But then you can go the other way.
[3:20:00.600 --> 3:20:09.600]  The Japanese centrally plan their 300-mile-an-hour speed trains, but there's no scams allowed, no frauds, so they do it inexpensively and actually put it in.
[3:20:09.600 --> 3:20:14.600]  So why can't we, even at a state level or federally do it, why is there so much corruption?
[3:20:14.600 --> 3:20:16.600]  Well, of course, and that's the whole issue.
[3:20:16.600 --> 3:20:24.600]  When you talk about campaign finance reform, Alex, the reason that we can't get there is because there's too much money and power in Washington.
[3:20:24.600 --> 3:20:27.600]  It's the concentration of power, the focus of it in that one area.
[3:20:27.600 --> 3:20:31.600]  When you get that much money and power, you can never control it with little artificial things like saying,
[3:20:31.600 --> 3:20:35.600]  we're going to control how campaign ads can be done.
[3:20:35.600 --> 3:20:36.600]  That's nonsense.
[3:20:36.600 --> 3:20:42.600]  They're going to find a way around it if you create this black hole of power, this kind of density that's going to pull all the people into that area.
[3:20:42.600 --> 3:20:47.600]  It's like a Trump getting rid of TPP and not controlling it himself, which he could have just said, I'm renegotiating.
[3:20:47.600 --> 3:20:50.600]  He said, it's dead, it's a fraud, killed it, handed power back to the people.
[3:20:50.600 --> 3:20:51.600]  Absolutely.
[3:20:51.600 --> 3:20:53.600]  And that's the key thing that he did this week.
[3:20:53.600 --> 3:20:58.600]  He absolutely destroyed the central part of the Global Span.
[3:20:58.600 --> 3:21:02.600]  We've talked about this, the trilateral plan that's the big new Brzezinski came up with.
[3:21:02.600 --> 3:21:07.600]  And they said that in the news in the Washington Post, we spent all this money on a trilateral plan to build this world order.
[3:21:07.600 --> 3:21:10.600]  Yeah, it's unelected, it enriches you, it's illegal, it's done.
[3:21:10.600 --> 3:21:14.600]  Yeah, and what he's done is he's unraveling just as Britain did with Brexit.
[3:21:14.600 --> 3:21:18.600]  He's unraveling the NAFTA and the North American Union, which was...
[3:21:18.600 --> 3:21:20.600]  So let's just sit back.
[3:21:20.600 --> 3:21:22.600]  Let's just really savor this.
[3:21:22.600 --> 3:21:26.600]  Their entire world government plan is falling before our eyes.
[3:21:26.600 --> 3:21:30.600]  We worked, we saw it, people educated, our listeners took action.
[3:21:30.600 --> 3:21:31.600]  That's why the enemy attacks us.
[3:21:31.600 --> 3:21:35.600]  We're at the heart of it, not getting credit, but our listeners deserve to know what they did.
[3:21:35.600 --> 3:21:36.600]  This is incredible.
[3:21:36.600 --> 3:21:38.600]  I mean, this came quicker than we thought.
[3:21:38.600 --> 3:21:40.600]  I knew the enemy was weak.
[3:21:40.600 --> 3:21:43.600]  Now, obviously we haven't won the war yet, but we're winning major battles.
[3:21:43.600 --> 3:21:45.600]  What are the pitfalls, David?
[3:21:45.600 --> 3:21:53.600]  Well, I think the pitfalls are that we don't have this come in through the back door because the globalists are going to continue to move in different directions.
[3:21:53.600 --> 3:21:56.600]  So we have to watch out, like I said before, about these infrastructure bills.
[3:21:56.600 --> 3:22:00.600]  Make sure they don't take control of the infrastructure in that way.
[3:22:00.600 --> 3:22:07.600]  But I think it's also important to understand, Alex, that this back and forth that we saw happened with Mexico this week.
[3:22:07.600 --> 3:22:11.600]  You saw two things happen yesterday that were polar opposites.
[3:22:11.600 --> 3:22:21.600]  You had the Mexican president bow up to Trump and nothing happened there except some bad threats going back and forth about taxes and tariffs.
[3:22:21.600 --> 3:22:26.600]  But on the other hand, you had the British Prime Minister come here and say, we're going to work with Donald Trump.
[3:22:26.600 --> 3:22:29.600]  And we're going to work on bilateral trade agreements.
[3:22:29.600 --> 3:22:31.600]  And that's what Trump is for.
[3:22:31.600 --> 3:22:35.600]  He's for trade agreements, as long as they're between two people at a time.
[3:22:35.600 --> 3:22:39.600]  He's multinational trade agreements that are really the pitfall, Alex.
[3:22:39.600 --> 3:22:43.600]  Exactly. You don't transfer your power to some big mothership out there.
[3:22:43.600 --> 3:22:48.600]  Each nation does a deal and they do a deal and each deal is actually done to make sure it's done right.
[3:22:48.600 --> 3:22:51.600]  Absolutely. That's a free market, true deal.
[3:22:51.600 --> 3:22:52.600]  I want to play a clip here.
[3:22:52.600 --> 3:22:54.600]  I'm going to take a few more calls and turn the baton over to David Fully here.
[3:22:54.600 --> 3:22:56.600]  Here's a clip of something.
[3:22:56.600 --> 3:23:01.600]  Black conservative dominates some of the leftist brainwashers out there marching,
[3:23:01.600 --> 3:23:05.600]  claiming everybody that's against Hillary's agenda is racist. Here it is.
[3:23:05.600 --> 3:23:08.600]  White power, that's a fucking problem.
[3:23:08.600 --> 3:23:12.600]  Oh my God, look at this racially inspired Clinton Donald Trump.
[3:23:12.600 --> 3:23:16.600]  No, no, no, I haven't been practicing. This is what I live. This is what I breathe.
[3:23:16.600 --> 3:23:19.600]  This is what I live. I'm being honest with you.
[3:23:19.600 --> 3:23:21.600]  I'm being honest with you.
[3:23:21.600 --> 3:23:25.600]  You allow Black Lives Matter on campus, but you don't allow white power on campus.
[3:23:25.600 --> 3:23:28.600]  Why not? It's the same shit.
[3:23:28.600 --> 3:23:31.600]  Both are hate group and neither are productive.
[3:23:31.600 --> 3:23:33.600]  So if you denounce one, denounce the other.
[3:23:33.600 --> 3:23:36.600]  Let's stop there. I'm sorry. I told you guys the plan. I didn't know it hadn't been bleeps.
[3:23:36.600 --> 3:23:39.600]  We got to bleep this for, I guess, for Sunday.
[3:23:39.600 --> 3:23:43.600]  This guy's on target. He's like, you let Black Matters on, but you don't let white power on.
[3:23:43.600 --> 3:23:48.600]  They're the same crap, which is happening exactly. It's like all complete crap.
[3:23:48.600 --> 3:23:54.600]  And so this guy's just seeing the reality and all these weird women have to actually click and go,
[3:23:54.600 --> 3:23:58.600]  yeah, that's true. Absolutely. I mean, you're saying one group matters.
[3:23:58.600 --> 3:24:01.600]  We're all humans. See, this guy's like Martin Luther King.
[3:24:01.600 --> 3:24:04.600]  He's repeating what Martin Luther King said, which I totally agree with.
[3:24:04.600 --> 3:24:07.600]  That's the opposite of what they're pushing, David.
[3:24:07.600 --> 3:24:10.600]  Absolutely. Alex, I don't know if that was from today's March for Life,
[3:24:10.600 --> 3:24:16.600]  but of course we're going to play some clips of Donald Trump talking to ABC as they interviewed him and saying,
[3:24:16.600 --> 3:24:21.600]  hey, you're probably not going to talk as much or certainly not in favorable terms about this weekend's demonstration
[3:24:21.600 --> 3:24:23.600]  like you did last weekend's demonstration.
[3:24:23.600 --> 3:24:26.600]  And we're also going to have a clip from Vice President Trump.
[3:24:26.600 --> 3:24:29.600]  He's the first vice president or president to speak at this rally.
[3:24:29.600 --> 3:24:31.600]  They've had it for 43 years.
[3:24:31.600 --> 3:24:34.600]  It totally freaks them out that a president would even give attention or a VP would go.
[3:24:34.600 --> 3:24:36.600]  I'm going to hand the baton to you, my friend.
[3:24:36.600 --> 3:24:40.600]  I just want to say here in closing that our sponsors make this whole broadcast possible.
[3:24:40.600 --> 3:24:46.600]  And again, Solutions from Science has amazing power charge generators, solar panel systems, you name it.

[3:25:17.600 --> 3:25:18.600]  David, I thank you so much.
[3:25:18.600 --> 3:25:19.600]  Go ahead and take over.
[3:25:19.600 --> 3:25:21.600]  Now the news coming up tonight, 7 o'clock Central.
[3:25:21.600 --> 3:25:22.600]  Thank you, Alex.
[3:25:22.600 --> 3:25:28.600]  And one of the things I want to talk about is the dishonest ways that we've seen the mainstream media report the news this last week.
[3:25:28.600 --> 3:25:33.600]  Now, earlier in the week, we saw Ari Fleischer saying that Press Secretary Sean Spicer,
[3:25:33.600 --> 3:25:36.600]  of course, Ari Fleischer was the Press Secretary for George W. Bush.
[3:25:36.600 --> 3:25:41.600]  He said, well, Spicer had an awful weekend or something like that.
[3:25:41.600 --> 3:25:48.600]  But then he picked up the ball and he hit a home run or put it through the ballpark or something to that effect.
[3:25:48.600 --> 3:25:50.600]  It was a baseball metaphor.
[3:25:50.600 --> 3:25:53.600]  What they left off was the second part of that.
[3:25:53.600 --> 3:26:00.600]  So they put it out as Ari Fleischer having a very harsh criticism of Sean Spicer by cutting the quote in half.
[3:26:00.600 --> 3:26:03.600]  Now, we got another situation where the same thing happened again today.
[3:26:03.600 --> 3:26:09.600]  They did this to Steve Bannon and he came out and he was had an interview with the New York Times and he said,
[3:26:09.600 --> 3:26:15.600]  the media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while.
[3:26:15.600 --> 3:26:18.600]  Now, how did they change that meaning?
[3:26:18.600 --> 3:26:23.600]  Well, they cut out the part where it said, just listen for a while to keep it in context.
[3:26:23.600 --> 3:26:25.600]  I said, the media should keep its mouth shut.
[3:26:25.600 --> 3:26:30.600]  So then the ACLU gets on its high horse and says, no, Bannon, the media should not keep its mouth shut.
[3:26:30.600 --> 3:26:34.600]  And if the Trump administration tries, we will see them in court.
[3:26:34.600 --> 3:26:39.600]  No ACLU, you need to listen to what he had to say.
[3:26:39.600 --> 3:26:40.600]  That's the whole point.
[3:26:40.600 --> 3:26:42.600]  Isn't it amazing the irony of this?
[3:26:42.600 --> 3:26:45.600]  Of course, it's not really irony, it's hypocrisy.
[3:26:45.600 --> 3:26:52.600]  The hypocrisy of these people coming out, cutting his quote in half, taking it out of context to completely change the meaning,
[3:26:52.600 --> 3:26:57.600]  just as they did about Ari Fleischer when he was saying, look, Sean Spicer had a rough beginning of the weekend,
[3:26:57.600 --> 3:27:00.600]  but by the end of the week, he had knocked us out of the park, okay?
[3:27:00.600 --> 3:27:05.600]  They did the same thing with Stephen Bannon, saying the media should keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while.
[3:27:05.600 --> 3:27:07.600]  And then they cut that off.
[3:27:07.600 --> 3:27:10.600]  And he says, I want you to quote this, Bannon went on to tell the New York Times.
[3:27:10.600 --> 3:27:14.600]  I want you to quote this, the media here is the opposition party.
[3:27:14.600 --> 3:27:16.600]  They don't understand this country.
[3:27:16.600 --> 3:27:20.600]  They still do not understand why Donald Trump is president of the United States.
[3:27:20.600 --> 3:27:25.600]  So then the Times says, well, I think Spicer's lost his credibility, don't you?
[3:27:25.600 --> 3:27:27.600]  Bannon said, are you kidding me?
[3:27:27.600 --> 3:27:29.600]  We think that's a badge of honor.
[3:27:29.600 --> 3:27:31.600]  Questioning his integrity, are you kidding me?
[3:27:31.600 --> 3:27:36.600]  The media has zero integrity, zero intelligence, no hard work.
[3:27:36.600 --> 3:27:46.600]  And they went on to prove him right by cutting his quote in half and then responding to something that came out to look like exactly the opposite of what he had to say.
[3:27:46.600 --> 3:27:50.600]  He goes on to say, you are the opposition party, not the Democratic Party.
[3:27:50.600 --> 3:27:52.600]  You're the opposition party.
[3:27:52.600 --> 3:27:56.600]  You're the press, the New York Times, the media is the opposition party.
[3:27:56.600 --> 3:27:57.600]  He's absolutely right.
[3:27:57.600 --> 3:28:04.600]  And by rightly listing them, sorry to jump in as the enemy, it's came over because they're already unpopular, already discredited, they're already hated.
[3:28:04.600 --> 3:28:06.600]  So if he just goes after him, it's came over.
[3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:07.600]  Absolutely.
[3:28:07.600 --> 3:28:08.600]  I was about to come on.
[3:28:08.600 --> 3:28:11.600]  I was already massaging my scalp like it was on the show.
[3:28:11.600 --> 3:28:12.600]  My hair is all messed up.
[3:28:12.600 --> 3:28:17.600]  But I had to pop in and say that because, again, I don't want to just call on the enemy just to say it.
[3:28:17.600 --> 3:28:21.600]  They're literally run by multinationals that have partially conquered the country.
[3:28:21.600 --> 3:28:22.600]  They are the enemy.
[3:28:22.600 --> 3:28:24.600]  I don't say that rhetorically as a flourish.
[3:28:24.600 --> 3:28:26.600]  They're the damn enemy.
[3:28:26.600 --> 3:28:27.600]  Absolutely.
[3:28:27.600 --> 3:28:28.600]  I'm out of here.
[3:28:28.600 --> 3:28:29.600]  Absolutely.
[3:28:29.600 --> 3:28:31.600]  A key part of the establishment is the press that has been selling this.
[3:28:31.600 --> 3:28:41.600]  And as we pointed out earlier, the amazing fact that CNN would say that the Trump White House is verging on obsession and their efforts to keep their promises.
[3:28:41.600 --> 3:28:42.600]  Of course they are.
[3:28:42.600 --> 3:28:44.600]  He wants to do the right thing.
[3:28:44.600 --> 3:28:49.600]  What they don't understand is that he really wanted to make these changes.
[3:28:49.600 --> 3:28:51.600]  He was really telling the truth.
[3:28:51.600 --> 3:28:52.600]  He was being candid.
[3:28:52.600 --> 3:28:53.600]  He was being honest.
[3:28:53.600 --> 3:28:57.600]  They're so used to lies that when somebody straight shoots them, they're like, where's the lie?
[3:28:57.600 --> 3:28:58.600]  It's okay to lie.
[3:28:58.600 --> 3:28:59.600]  Tell us how you're lying.
[3:28:59.600 --> 3:29:00.600]  They're like, this is called straight shooting.
[3:29:00.600 --> 3:29:01.600]  You ever heard of it?
[3:29:01.600 --> 3:29:02.600]  Yeah, absolutely.
[3:29:02.600 --> 3:29:03.600]  And that's the thing, Alex.
[3:29:03.600 --> 3:29:09.600]  As we go through all of this, the reason that the public, when Donald Trump says something
[3:29:09.600 --> 3:29:14.600]  and people react to it, they understand, number one, the press is spinning this to make it look worse than it is.
[3:29:14.600 --> 3:29:15.600]  Or cutting out of context.
[3:29:15.600 --> 3:29:16.600]  You never know.
[3:29:16.600 --> 3:29:17.600]  Exactly.
[3:29:17.600 --> 3:29:20.600]  Number two, they understand he's an honest guy.
[3:29:20.600 --> 3:29:22.600]  He's got authenticity.
[3:29:22.600 --> 3:29:23.600]  People value authenticity.
[3:29:23.600 --> 3:29:25.600]  They value integrity.
[3:29:25.600 --> 3:29:27.600]  And that's what we've seen in this last week.
[3:29:27.600 --> 3:29:30.600]  They want to keep their promises.
[3:29:30.600 --> 3:29:32.600]  He's doing everything he can to keep his promises.
[3:29:32.600 --> 3:29:34.600]  That is amazing, I think.
[3:29:34.600 --> 3:29:35.600]  We're going to take a quick break.
[3:29:35.600 --> 3:29:36.600]  We're going to be right back.
[3:29:36.600 --> 3:29:37.600]  Stay with us.
[3:29:37.600 --> 3:29:41.600]  We've got news about how Mexico is really declared war.
[3:29:41.600 --> 3:29:43.600]  This is what the president of Mexico did this week.
[3:29:43.600 --> 3:29:44.600]  He declared war in the United States.
[3:29:44.600 --> 3:29:45.600]  He will tell you how.
[3:29:45.600 --> 3:29:46.600]  Stay with us.
[3:29:46.600 --> 3:29:47.600]  You're right.
[3:29:47.600 --> 3:29:50.600]  They made a big mistake not taking Trump's deal.
[3:29:50.600 --> 3:29:51.600]  We're on the march.
[3:29:51.600 --> 3:29:54.600]  The empire's on the run.
[3:29:54.600 --> 3:29:57.600]  What gives away the sacrifice now?
[3:29:57.600 --> 3:29:58.600]  You're right.
[3:29:58.600 --> 3:30:12.640]  But the strikes are still="#
[3:30:12.640 --> 3:30:17.600]  taking. It turns out Batista, owner of the EBX group, was involved in bribes to the government
[3:30:17.600 --> 3:30:23.280]  via interactions with former governor of Rio de Janeiro, Sergio Cabral, who was also arrested
[3:30:23.280 --> 3:30:28.160]  in conjunctions with activities involving the state-owned oil company Petrovas. Brazil's
[3:30:28.160 --> 3:30:33.120]  own drain, the swamp, has been called Yava Jato, or Car Wash. It has produced many arrests,
[3:30:33.120 --> 3:30:38.800]  including Cabral's top aide and former secretary in Rio, Wilson Carlos Carvalho, former governor of
[3:30:38.800 --> 3:30:44.480]  Rio Anthony Garatinho, under suspicion of vote rigging, a former top executive with Batista
[3:30:44.480 --> 3:30:49.600]  Flavio Godinho, accused of money laundering and association with Cabral, and another top aide
[3:30:49.600 --> 3:30:54.880]  of Cabral's Carlos Miranda has also been jailed, showing the United States that it is possible
[3:30:54.880 --> 3:31:18.480]  to drain the swamp and nobody is above the law. This is Owen Schreuer for Infowars.com.

[3:33:26.560 --> 3:33:38.880]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight, your host on the last of this fourth
[3:33:38.880 --> 3:33:46.000]  hour of today's Friday Show. We're talking in the last segment about Stephen Bannon saying
[3:33:46.000 --> 3:33:49.840]  you are the opposition party. He said that to the press. He specifically said it to the New York
[3:33:49.840 --> 3:33:54.880]  Times and I want to give you an example of this going back to Tuesday. Now this is before the
[3:33:54.880 --> 3:34:01.040]  back and forth between the president of Mexico and Donald Trump, president of the US. This is
[3:34:01.040 --> 3:34:05.840]  before this happened. This is Tuesday and this is the headline from the New York Times, the same
[3:34:05.840 --> 3:34:10.160]  people that had the interview with Stephen Bannon where he said you are the opposition. Here's what
[3:34:10.160 --> 3:34:17.120]  the opposition said, the paid opposition said. Mexico's potential weapons if Trump declares war
[3:34:17.120 --> 3:34:23.920]  on NAFTA. So they're war gaming with Mexico on how they can keep us in NAFTA even though
[3:34:23.920 --> 3:34:29.360]  Trump doesn't want to send NAFTA. This is the New York Times. But I want you to listen to the quotes
[3:34:29.360 --> 3:34:34.320]  from the former Mexican officials that they talked to as well. So here's how the New York Times puts
[3:34:34.320 --> 3:34:39.360]  it. They say, how could Mexico inflict the most damage on the US? Mexican governments over the
[3:34:39.360 --> 3:34:43.520]  last quarter of a century have consistently pushed back against the nation's historical
[3:34:43.520 --> 3:34:48.240]  resentment toward the United States. So what they're saying is, yeah, Mexicans have typically
[3:34:48.240 --> 3:34:51.680]  always hated the United States except for the last quarter of a century. What changed in the
[3:34:51.680 --> 3:34:56.720]  last quarter of a century? NAFTA. NAFTA changed. So now they don't hate us so much because they're
[3:34:56.720 --> 3:35:01.920]  making out like bandits. They started out from a situation of rough trade parity as I've mentioned
[3:35:01.920 --> 3:35:09.680]  many times. And immediately when NAFTA passed, we had a $15 billion trade deficit with Mexico and
[3:35:09.680 --> 3:35:14.640]  it's grown continuously since then. It's never been less than $15 billion. In recent years,
[3:35:14.640 --> 3:35:21.920]  it's been between $60 and $75 billion. Now, the New York Times goes on to say, well, Mexico's main
[3:35:21.920 --> 3:35:28.080]  challenge as it confronts a hostile Trump administration is the enormous asymmetry of the
[3:35:28.080 --> 3:35:33.840]  bilateral relationship. Yeah, I would say that Donald Trump is holding all the cards because,
[3:35:33.840 --> 3:35:37.920]  as I just pointed out to you, we have a lot of trade that goes back and forth between the US and
[3:35:37.920 --> 3:35:46.640]  Mexico. But the trade to the US is 80% of their exports, not ours, 80% of theirs. And they're
[3:35:46.640 --> 3:35:53.600]  the ones with a $60 to $75 billion trade surplus every year, not the United States. So they have
[3:35:53.600 --> 3:35:58.240]  the most to lose. But then they say, well, what can we do? And so they say, well, Mexico
[3:35:58.240 --> 3:36:02.960]  still cooperate and the fight against drug trafficking. They're not doing it now, are they?
[3:36:02.960 --> 3:36:08.320]  No, they're not. Drug cartels are going back and forth. As a matter of fact, the drug cartels are
[3:36:08.320 --> 3:36:14.000]  deeply embedded in the corrupt Mexican government. Just look at the, what was that movie? It's
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:21.680]  Cartel Land, I think it was. We have the individuals in a small area there that's led by a doctor.
[3:36:21.680 --> 3:36:25.360]  And what they said was, we're tired of the corruption with the federales and the banditos,
[3:36:25.360 --> 3:36:28.880]  right, that are coming in here. So we're going to stand up on our own. We're going to protect our
[3:36:28.880 --> 3:36:33.200]  own area here. And what did they get into? They got into a fight with the government
[3:36:33.200 --> 3:36:37.120]  because they wanted to protect themselves against the drug cartels. It was like,
[3:36:38.240 --> 3:36:42.400]  it was like the Magnificent Seven. Remember the movie, Magnificent Seven? These people all got
[3:36:42.400 --> 3:36:46.560]  together, so we're going to protect ourselves. And the government is corrupt and we have these
[3:36:46.560 --> 3:36:49.760]  criminals that are coming in here. And so the government came in on the side of the criminals
[3:36:49.760 --> 3:36:54.080]  and eventually shut that down. So no, they say, well, Mexico still cooperate in the fight against
[3:36:54.080 --> 3:37:00.080]  drug trafficking. Give me a break. Will it stop foreign terrorists from using Mexico as a way
[3:37:00.080 --> 3:37:06.400]  station? Are they doing that now? Of course they aren't. We have reported for years here at Info
[3:37:06.400 --> 3:37:10.560]  Wars. Many people have reported this. We've talked about how it's an open porous border, but not only
[3:37:10.560 --> 3:37:16.800]  that, Mexico assists people to get across their country. If you come in, you're coming in from
[3:37:16.800 --> 3:37:21.200]  Cuba or you're coming in from Central South America, or you're coming in from some Islamic
[3:37:21.200 --> 3:37:25.680]  country, come on in. You can't stay here. You're not going to be allowed to stay in Mexico,
[3:37:25.680 --> 3:37:29.680]  but we'll help you get out of our country and get into America if you're determined to go.
[3:37:29.680 --> 3:37:35.360]  That's the situation now. So that's not a chip that Mexico can play with us, even though that's
[3:37:35.360 --> 3:37:42.800]  the way Jorge Castaneda, a former foreign secretary of Mexico, described it. And here's what the
[3:37:42.800 --> 3:37:49.840]  foreign secretary, the former foreign secretary of Mexico said. He said, let Mr. Trump pull the
[3:37:49.840 --> 3:37:55.360]  United States out of NAFTA. Instead of stopping Central American migrants at its southern border,
[3:37:55.360 --> 3:37:59.760]  Mexico should let them through on their way to the United States while they're doing that now.
[3:38:00.640 --> 3:38:07.920]  And let's see if his wall keeps the terrorist out because we won't. You understand that? This is
[3:38:07.920 --> 3:38:15.040]  Mexico saying in retaliation for shutting down this globalist plan that is a stepping stone to a
[3:38:15.040 --> 3:38:20.080]  North American Union. Understand that. You've already seen it in Europe. You saw that they came in,
[3:38:20.080 --> 3:38:25.040]  they created a trade zone, and they created an economic and trade consolidation. And then,
[3:38:25.040 --> 3:38:29.600]  as that started to have the problems that they created, they said, we need more sovereignty.
[3:38:29.600 --> 3:38:34.480]  We're going to pull more power into Brussels in order to control all of this. And at that point,
[3:38:34.480 --> 3:38:39.520]  the British said, we know where this is headed. We have absolutely no question as to where this
[3:38:39.520 --> 3:38:43.920]  is headed. This is headed toward a political consolidation. That is always a step. You create
[3:38:43.920 --> 3:38:50.240]  economic consolidation, then you create political consolidation because they can use the economic
[3:38:50.240 --> 3:38:54.480]  consolidation to create problems. And say, the only way you can address that is with political
[3:38:54.480 --> 3:39:00.400]  consolidation. So they shut that down. And of course, that's what they're now trying to do in
[3:39:00.400 --> 3:39:04.320]  America. That's NAFTA was the first part of that. So we're going to have economic consolidation,
[3:39:04.320 --> 3:39:09.360]  then they're going to create a North American Union, a political consolidation. And of course,
[3:39:09.360 --> 3:39:14.560]  you've had these globalist organizations, the Council on Foreign Relations, and others talking
[3:39:14.560 --> 3:39:19.760]  about how they could create a common border around the US, Canada, and Mexico, have it
[3:39:19.760 --> 3:39:25.280]  patrolled by homeland security that we pull those three. They made it very clear that they're looking
[3:39:25.280 --> 3:39:30.320]  for a political consolidation. So the way that the New York Times is putting this in there,
[3:39:30.320 --> 3:39:36.000]  along with these Mexican officials, is to say, we're going to assist the terrorists. We're not
[3:39:36.000 --> 3:39:41.280]  going to do anything to stop terrorists from coming into your country. Now, folks, that is war.
[3:39:41.840 --> 3:39:45.520]  And if that isn't clear enough, that was on Tuesday. Let me tell you then what the Mexican
[3:39:45.520 --> 3:39:50.320]  president did on Wednesday, because the way this is being spun in the press, they're saying,
[3:39:50.320 --> 3:39:55.840]  there goes Trump again, Trump in his Twitter, he picked a fight with a foreign president.
[3:39:55.840 --> 3:39:58.800]  And look at this, now they're not going to have a meeting. Isn't he a horrible guy?
[3:39:59.680 --> 3:40:04.640]  No, let's understand where this is coming from. The New York Times and the Mexican government are
[3:40:04.640 --> 3:40:10.960]  saying, what if he declares war on the US? Well, they basically start wargaming on how they can
[3:40:10.960 --> 3:40:16.320]  declare war on the United States by assisting terrorists and other people to come to drug cartels,
[3:40:16.320 --> 3:40:20.960]  to come into our country. But let me read you this speech, because we see this speech all
[3:40:20.960 --> 3:40:26.000]  the time. We don't see anything but little excerpts from it in subtitles. Here's the transcript of
[3:40:26.000 --> 3:40:32.080]  the speech. And I want to give you a couple of excerpts from here. This is what the Mexican
[3:40:32.080 --> 3:40:36.160]  president said before Donald Trump said, hey, if you're not going to build a wall, then don't
[3:40:36.160 --> 3:40:40.080]  even bother coming to the meeting. This is what he said. The Mexican president said,
[3:40:40.080 --> 3:40:47.200]  Mexico's 50 consulates in the United States will become true ramparts in defense of migrant rights.
[3:40:47.760 --> 3:40:51.920]  Do you understand that? He says, we've got 50 consulates in the United States, one in each
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:41:01.360]  state. And we're going to make those forts to defend our migrant rights. When you have a massive
[3:41:01.360 --> 3:41:06.080]  uncontrolled immigration into a country, and they openly say that they are not going to
[3:41:06.080 --> 3:41:09.680]  assimilate, but they are going to demand rights from you. What are they demanding?
[3:41:10.320 --> 3:41:14.480]  They're demanding a free education. They're demanding that they get to vote in our elections.
[3:41:14.480 --> 3:41:19.760]  And yet they continue to see themselves first and foremost as Mexican citizens.
[3:41:19.760 --> 3:41:24.880]  You remember after the election, you had the Mexican consulates putting out information
[3:41:24.880 --> 3:41:28.560]  doing exactly this. This isn't something that started on Wednesday. This started after the
[3:41:28.560 --> 3:41:32.720]  election of Donald Trump. They said, come to the Mexican consulates. We are going to tell you
[3:41:33.280 --> 3:41:39.360]  how you can thwart American law and stay in that country illegally. So they were war gaming with
[3:41:39.360 --> 3:41:45.040]  them. Then now he declares this. And I put this out on, it was a report we did last night,
[3:41:45.040 --> 3:41:48.800]  Leanne McAdoo and I, and I put this out on Twitter. A lot of people responded that.
[3:41:48.800 --> 3:41:52.480]  One of the persons said, and of course, if you want to follow the discussion on Twitter,
[3:41:52.480 --> 3:41:58.080]  is that Liberty Tarion is my Twitter handle. One of the persons said, well, let's get rid of the
[3:41:58.080 --> 3:42:03.120]  consulates. Let's shut them down. They're here saying that they're going to shut down our country.
[3:42:03.120 --> 3:42:07.360]  Let's shut them down. Let's send out these 50 consuls. And I said, yeah, I didn't have a problem.
[3:42:07.360 --> 3:42:12.880]  I didn't take very long for Obama to send out 35 Russians. Let's send out these 50 consuls there.
[3:42:12.880 --> 3:42:18.000]  Then he goes on to say this, wherever a Mexican migrant, this is a Mexican president,
[3:42:18.000 --> 3:42:23.200]  wherever a Mexican migrant is at risk and needs our help, we must be there. His or her country
[3:42:23.200 --> 3:42:28.160]  must be there. You understand? They're not coming to America to live. They're not coming to America
[3:42:28.160 --> 3:42:35.520]  to be Americans. They're coming here, says the Mexican president, as citizens of his country.
[3:42:36.080 --> 3:42:40.880]  He goes on to say, join me in working to support and stand by our fellow citizens.
[3:42:40.880 --> 3:42:47.040]  This is why I say, and we always have to be careful about the language. The liberals will always use
[3:42:47.040 --> 3:42:51.520]  the language to win the argument. They will change the terms. That's why you see them no
[3:42:51.520 --> 3:42:57.280]  longer talking about illegal aliens. We can't use that term. That's a legalistic, that's a term of law.
[3:42:58.160 --> 3:43:03.280]  Can't say that. Gotta say undocumented workers. No, these are foreign citizens
[3:43:04.240 --> 3:43:12.400]  here in defiance of our law demanding benefits, demanding rights that belong to American citizens.
[3:43:12.400 --> 3:43:18.400]  That's what we need to say. Foreign citizens here illegally in defiance of our law. That's what these
[3:43:18.400 --> 3:43:23.760]  people are. And that's what the Mexican president said. He said, they are our fellow citizens.
[3:43:23.760 --> 3:43:29.360]  Stand by me to support our fellow citizens at the Mexican consulates. We're going to defend
[3:43:29.360 --> 3:43:36.000]  their rights. We're going to make our consulates into ramparts and to forts to push back against
[3:43:36.000 --> 3:43:41.840]  American law. He said the Mexican government will offer them legal advice to guarantee the protection
[3:43:41.840 --> 3:43:50.160]  they require. And then he says, Mexico does not believe in walls. Well, they believe in ramparts.
[3:43:51.040 --> 3:43:56.080]  They believe in forts. They believe in taking over other countries. They believe in demanding
[3:43:56.080 --> 3:44:01.680]  rights that they're taking away from us. Say, when you come in and you vote in our elections,
[3:44:01.680 --> 3:44:07.600]  can you imagine if we went into Mexico and we said, we're going to use the American Consulate
[3:44:07.600 --> 3:44:12.880]  and Embassy to help people stay in Mexico illegally. We're going to demand that they pay for our
[3:44:12.880 --> 3:44:17.840]  education of our children. We're going to demand that we get to vote in Mexican elections. The
[3:44:17.840 --> 3:44:23.120]  probably would be an improvement because they've had a corrupt government as long as I've known
[3:44:23.120 --> 3:44:28.720]  about the Mexican government. But understand at the same time that we had Barack Obama give
[3:44:28.720 --> 3:44:34.160]  $75 million to the Mexican government to help them secure their southern border, their border with
[3:44:34.160 --> 3:44:41.440]  other countries other than the United States. Now, they have responded by shipping their problems
[3:44:41.440 --> 3:44:49.200]  into our country. And as I said before, if you look at the difference between the two ways that
[3:44:49.200 --> 3:44:54.240]  this is being played, you've got the Mexican government full on with globalism, with the
[3:44:54.240 --> 3:44:59.200]  North American Union, with NAFTA, along with the press, along with the New York Times, war gaming
[3:44:59.200 --> 3:45:03.600]  as to how they can take the American government down. Meanwhile, you have the British Prime
[3:45:03.600 --> 3:45:10.320]  Minister saying, let's stand together and halt the eclipse of the West. That's precisely what is
[3:45:10.320 --> 3:45:17.120]  happening. If we do not stand together, if we do not work together and do it in a bilateral way,
[3:45:17.120 --> 3:45:22.160]  again, Donald Trump has come out and said, we are going to shut down these multinational,
[3:45:23.200 --> 3:45:28.480]  multilateral trade agreements. He understands that somebody who puts together deals, first of all,
[3:45:28.480 --> 3:45:33.920]  from a just a pragmatic standpoint, you're not going to be able to negotiate something with 12
[3:45:33.920 --> 3:45:38.560]  parties simultaneously like you can between two individuals. You go in and you make a deal, you
[3:45:38.560 --> 3:45:43.440]  make it between two individuals if you really want to get something done. The more people you get in,
[3:45:43.440 --> 3:45:47.520]  the less satisfactory the deal, the less likely the deal is going to get through.
[3:45:47.520 --> 3:45:53.120]  That's not why they have these multinational multilateral agreements. These multilateral
[3:45:53.120 --> 3:46:00.880]  agreements exist so that they can empower some new entity so that they can take power away from
[3:46:00.880 --> 3:46:05.280]  the United States and from Britain. That's the whole point of this. And so that's why the two of
[3:46:05.280 --> 3:46:09.840]  them are saying, look, we want trade. We want trade between our countries. We want trade that
[3:46:09.840 --> 3:46:17.040]  favors us. We do not want to create an extra national, a globalist organization that is going
[3:46:17.040 --> 3:46:21.920]  to take away our decisions on how we run our country. That is the key thing. Now, as we talked
[3:46:21.920 --> 3:46:28.960]  about the massive changes that Donald Trump has made, and again when we look at even Politico and
[3:46:28.960 --> 3:46:33.760]  CNN, CNN starts out, forget the first 100 days because that's usually what they look at, the
[3:46:33.760 --> 3:46:39.120]  first 100 days of a new administration. We'll go back and use that as a benchmark.
[3:46:39.760 --> 3:46:45.680]  No, Donald Trump in just one week has done more than we typically see in the first 100 days.
[3:46:45.680 --> 3:46:52.320]  And of course, we saw Donald Trump as president-elect do more than Barack Obama did in eight years
[3:46:52.320 --> 3:46:58.800]  to help the economy. He should have gone back and listened to James Carvel when he told Bill
[3:46:58.800 --> 3:47:03.520]  Clinton as he was running for president. It's the economy, stupid. That's what we have to focus on
[3:47:03.520 --> 3:47:08.880]  is the economy. That's what Donald Trump focused on even before he became president as president-elect.
[3:47:08.880 --> 3:47:13.280]  He did more to help us. So here we are the first week. They say it's only been a week and Donald
[3:47:13.280 --> 3:47:19.200]  Trump is reinventing the presidency. He honored his campaign promises and dramatically reshaped
[3:47:19.200 --> 3:47:25.840]  Washington's role in national and global affairs. He's done a great deal. He's done the right things.
[3:47:25.840 --> 3:47:31.280]  He's been, as they put it, obsessive about keeping his promises. That's a good thing.
[3:47:31.920 --> 3:47:36.480]  But you have to understand that America is bleeding so badly from what the globalists have
[3:47:36.480 --> 3:47:41.440]  done. And I'm not just saying Barack Obama. Certainly he stepped this up. He accelerated it.
[3:47:41.440 --> 3:47:45.040]  But it goes back to the Bushes. It goes back to the Clintons. This is something that's been going
[3:47:45.040 --> 3:47:48.560]  on for quite some time. And we're not going to be able to turn this ship of state around
[3:47:49.200 --> 3:47:55.520]  in just a week. And to give you an example of how dire the situation is and why we need somebody
[3:47:55.520 --> 3:48:00.000]  like Donald Trump and why we really ought to thank God that we have somebody who is moving
[3:48:00.000 --> 3:48:05.360]  like this. Here's a story from WND pointing out that, yes, it's been a week and Donald Trump has
[3:48:05.360 --> 3:48:13.200]  got a lot of things done. But in the meantime, 1960 refugees came into the United States from
[3:48:13.200 --> 3:48:20.240]  Sharia-compliant countries, countries like Syria, Somalia, Burma, Iraq, Sudan, Afghanistan.
[3:48:20.960 --> 3:48:27.600]  We've had nearly 2,000 people come in during the week. Okay. And they're pointing out that every day
[3:48:27.600 --> 3:48:31.600]  that this is going on, it's another several hundred that are coming into this country.
[3:48:31.600 --> 3:48:35.520]  So Barack Obama's policies and that respect are continuing. And they said, well,
[3:48:35.520 --> 3:48:39.840]  we were hoping that this was going to be shut down on Thursday. Friday may be the day. Some sources
[3:48:39.840 --> 3:48:43.600]  say it could be put off until Saturday. For every day, the administration fails to act.
[3:48:43.600 --> 3:48:49.680]  Hundreds more refugees arrive from the third world. On Thursday alone, 541 United Nations
[3:48:49.680 --> 3:48:57.840]  selected refugees arrive in the United States. Ah, did you hear that? 541 United Nations selected.
[3:48:57.840 --> 3:49:04.640]  So the UN is deciding who's going to be coming into our country. The UN is vetting,
[3:49:04.640 --> 3:49:08.560]  if you want to use that word, the people who are going to come into our country.
[3:49:09.760 --> 3:49:15.360]  That is the problem. Donald Trump understands that. In the very first week, he's talked about
[3:49:15.360 --> 3:49:21.280]  how he's going to cut funding to the United Nations by 40%. I think that's a start.
[3:49:22.320 --> 3:49:27.440]  We need to just get out of the United Nations. And of course, we've had a bill introduced by
[3:49:27.440 --> 3:49:32.000]  a legislator. Can't remember. It's either in Alabama or Georgia to do just that.
[3:49:32.880 --> 3:49:36.400]  You need to look that up. You need to push that. You need to talk to Donald Trump,
[3:49:36.400 --> 3:49:42.960]  send him messages, tell him to get us out of the United Nations. Let's do an American exit
[3:49:42.960 --> 3:49:47.600]  out of the United Nations. And of course, when we look at what the United Nations is doing,
[3:49:48.240 --> 3:49:53.680]  there's an article from New American and they point out that there's actually a dictator
[3:49:53.680 --> 3:50:00.320]  alliance there right now that's been pushing for a United Nations tax agency. And they're openly
[3:50:00.320 --> 3:50:06.800]  talking about how they need a tax agency to support a new world order. Where have we heard
[3:50:06.800 --> 3:50:11.120]  that before? So it's just a conspiracy theory, right? They're talking about a new world order.
[3:50:11.120 --> 3:50:14.560]  Now, they're saying the world's largest alliance, the third world dictators and governments known
[3:50:14.560 --> 3:50:21.680]  as the group of 77, is 77 countries, plus China. But they say it's also actually composed of more
[3:50:21.680 --> 3:50:26.080]  than 130 regimes. I don't know why they call it the group of 77. Maybe that's where it began
[3:50:26.080 --> 3:50:31.600]  initially. But that's a large amount of the large percentage of the United Nations. There's about
[3:50:32.400 --> 3:50:37.440]  200 member states. So when you've got 130 some odd regimes, that's a majority there.
[3:50:37.440 --> 3:50:41.920]  What are they trying to do? They're trying to create a tax agency at the United Nations.
[3:50:42.480 --> 3:50:48.240]  And they're calling for a new world order. That's the new world order from the G77.
[3:50:48.240 --> 3:50:54.080]  This is what we're talking about, folks. This is where this is coming from. It's coming from
[3:50:54.080 --> 3:50:58.240]  the United Nations. They're the ones who are selecting the refugees to come into our country.
[3:50:58.240 --> 3:51:26.240]  That has to stop. We've got to get out of the UN. Stay with us for me right back.

[3:54:19.120 --> 3:54:23.360]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we're going to play the clip of Vice
[3:54:23.360 --> 3:54:30.400]  President Pence speaking at the March for Life. He is the first president or vice president to
[3:54:30.400 --> 3:54:36.000]  speak at the March for Life and it's been going on for 44 years. Think about that. Not Reagan,
[3:54:36.000 --> 3:54:43.200]  not the Bushes. Nobody has spoken at this as a president or vice president until now and not
[3:54:43.200 --> 3:54:48.400]  only is Vice President Pence speaking there but also Kellyanne Conway is speaking there today.
[3:54:48.400 --> 3:54:53.040]  So I think we have someone who is pushing this very hard. We also played earlier in the show
[3:54:53.600 --> 3:54:58.320]  the back and forth between ABC News and Donald Trump where he says you're probably not going to
[3:54:58.320 --> 3:55:05.920]  cover the March for Life like you did the women's march last weekend. So the Trump administration
[3:55:05.920 --> 3:55:09.440]  is on top of this. We're going to give you his comments, play a clip of that before we do real
[3:55:09.440 --> 3:55:15.120]  quickly. I want to remind you that we're about to sell out of DNA force again. We sold out of it
[3:55:15.120 --> 3:55:19.040]  once and it was out for a couple of months. We still have it at 10% discount so it's moving
[3:55:19.040 --> 3:55:23.680]  pretty quickly. It's going to be selling out very shortly. So move on that right now that's a very,
[3:55:24.480 --> 3:55:28.480]  that's a great savings. It's very difficult for us to produce that. It's very expensive to produce
[3:55:28.480 --> 3:55:35.440]  it and that's why it sells out and we have to re-up that again. Also we have a 25% discount
[3:55:35.440 --> 3:55:42.000]  on Alexa Pure Pro Water Filter Systems and Alexa Breeze Air Filter Systems at infowarsstore.com.
[3:55:42.560 --> 3:55:49.200]  It's 25% off water filters and air filters from Alexa Pure. So take a look at infowarsstore.com
[3:55:49.200 --> 3:55:56.880]  to find that and also go to infowarslife to see the DNA force special as well as many other
[3:55:56.880 --> 3:56:02.240]  specials that we have at infowarslife.com. Now real quickly before I play this clip from him,
[3:56:02.240 --> 3:56:08.960]  I want to say briefly what we're talking about before in terms of the way the left uses language.
[3:56:09.520 --> 3:56:15.360]  Sean Spicer, press secretary for Donald Trump, took exception to the fact that CNN called the
[3:56:15.360 --> 3:56:19.280]  people who are marching for life and for adoption referred to them as demonstrators.
[3:56:19.840 --> 3:56:24.480]  That's not the problem. They are demonstrators. Quite frankly, if you look at the definition
[3:56:24.480 --> 3:56:28.960]  of the word, a demonstrator, somebody who's doing a public demonstration, it's a political meeting,
[3:56:28.960 --> 3:56:33.840]  it's a march. You're trying to demonstrate something. You're trying to teach through exhibits.
[3:56:33.840 --> 3:56:39.040]  That's what a real demonstration is. The problem is that Sean Spicer is looking at this and saying,
[3:56:39.040 --> 3:56:42.400]  well, wait a minute, you're calling all these violent people last week, a week ago at the
[3:56:42.400 --> 3:56:46.160]  inauguration, you call them demonstrators. Clearly these things are not the same thing.
[3:56:46.720 --> 3:56:50.480]  And we pointed out many times we even had that little clip that Darren McBreen put together.
[3:56:50.480 --> 3:56:56.320]  This is a demonstration or a protest. This is a riot. Okay. We have to understand those people
[3:56:56.320 --> 3:57:03.120]  are rioters when they're noisy, violent, disorderly at a political, even if it is for political
[3:57:03.120 --> 3:57:08.160]  purposes, that is a riot. It is not a demonstration. So this truly is a demonstration. We need to
[3:57:08.160 --> 3:57:11.840]  make sure that we start calling them rioters. We don't need to worry about it being called a
[3:57:11.840 --> 3:57:16.720]  demonstration. But let's play a quick clip of what Vice President Pence said today at the
[3:57:16.720 --> 3:57:24.480]  March for Life. 44 years ago, our Supreme Court turned away from the first of these timeless ideals.
[3:57:24.480 --> 3:57:34.320]  But today, three generations, hence, because of all of you and the many thousands who stand
[3:57:34.320 --> 3:57:42.720]  with us in marches like this all across the nation, life is winning again in America.
[3:57:47.840 --> 3:57:52.080]  Absolutely. That's very important. And he went on to say that President Trump will work with
[3:57:52.080 --> 3:57:58.640]  Congress to end taxpayer funding of abortion and abortion providers. And we will devote those
[3:57:58.640 --> 3:58:05.680]  resources to healthcare services for women across America. Understand that when they put this out
[3:58:05.680 --> 3:58:10.160]  and they say, you know, Planned Parenthood is about health services for women and we need to stick
[3:58:10.160 --> 3:58:17.200]  back. No, when you murder a baby girl, that is not providing health services for women. And of
[3:58:17.200 --> 3:58:21.600]  course, I mentioned baby girls because a lot of these feminists wouldn't have a problem
[3:58:21.600 --> 3:58:25.600]  murdering a baby boy, but they might think twice about murdering a baby girl. That's not health
[3:58:25.600 --> 3:58:30.720]  services for women. We need to be able to distinguish between the language that they
[3:58:30.720 --> 3:58:52.240]  use yet again. Okay, join us tonight for the info wars nightly news.
