[01:02.200 --> 01:12.200]  Bill Maher the HBO talk show host just sickening sickening statement that he
[01:12.200 --> 01:19.280]  made that I guess he knew was public but was in an obscure place and maybe this
[01:19.280 --> 01:22.960]  is just par for the course though what he said maybe maybe he'll get awards maybe
[01:22.960 --> 01:28.400]  he'll get a peace prize like Obama has for his activities and I'll just tell
[01:28.400 --> 01:33.760]  you this it ties into this lawsuit jail guards flush baby down the toilet that's
[01:33.760 --> 01:39.960]  a WS MV television and the mother of three she had a miscarriage they flush
[01:39.960 --> 01:44.440]  the baby the large miscarriage the baby down the toilet and laughter that sounds
[01:44.440 --> 01:50.280]  like we've got candidates for TSA orders and hey why not rip catheters out of
[01:50.280 --> 01:54.280]  men and women and laugh at you why not take your screaming crying child behind
[01:54.280 --> 01:58.000]  closed doors and have a man with a big potbelly and a mustache start grabbing
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.000]  on them I mean you know there's nothing wrong with this picture I mean al-Qaeda
[02:01.000 --> 02:05.720]  may be hiding in the diaper so we're gonna be going over all of that drudge
[02:05.720 --> 02:11.600]  report calm last night link to this it's now down on the lower left hand side I
[02:11.600 --> 02:15.440]  say that because it's already scrolled off info wars calm I tell you Paul
[02:15.440 --> 02:18.720]  Watson is so prolific that he writes like five articles a day all of them
[02:18.720 --> 02:22.360]  important he's obsessed with news and info the guy works about 18 hours a day
[02:22.360 --> 02:28.000]  with his wife eon who also works with us and can't pull him away from the work
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.160]  but then he writes these articles at night at night our time which is like
[02:32.160 --> 02:36.720]  midnight his time and then at night they never get attention thank God the drudge
[02:36.720 --> 02:40.560]  report link to it because it's already scrolled off our main page I want to get
[02:40.560 --> 02:46.200]  this move back to the front page of info wars calm coming next TSA taser
[02:46.200 --> 02:51.560]  bracelets you we first reported on this a few years ago if they're back the
[02:51.560 --> 02:54.880]  homeland security was like well yeah everyone will wear a taser bracelet I
[02:54.880 --> 03:01.560]  mean why not it's to stop al-Qaeda that the government publicly runs so all of
[03:01.560 --> 03:06.360]  that is coming up today now we're gonna talk about the big debate coming up
[03:06.360 --> 03:13.680]  tonight between Ryan and Biden and this should be a zinger because Biden is
[03:13.680 --> 03:17.600]  gangsterish and man and better on his feet sometimes in Obama but he's
[03:17.600 --> 03:23.600]  doddering for my guess how many strokes and embolisms as he had so I mean
[03:23.600 --> 03:29.880]  nothing if people have had embolisms I'm just pointing out that it should
[03:29.880 --> 03:35.120]  definitely be entertaining but it is just that entertainment I mean Joe Biden
[03:35.120 --> 03:40.520]  is just a total piece of work but when you get down to it mr. Ryan talks about
[03:40.520 --> 03:43.880]  a lot of issues that I agree with the problem is he didn't necessarily vote
[03:43.880 --> 03:48.800]  that way in the Congress so we're gonna be looking at all those different angles
[03:48.800 --> 03:55.560]  also let's get dr. Corsi on I said no guest today and I decided to book Watson
[03:55.560 --> 03:59.280]  right before the show I wanted to just take calls and then now I forgot I was
[03:59.280 --> 04:03.160]  on man Cal this morning he brought it up I went looked it up and dr. Corsi just
[04:03.160 --> 04:05.800]  calling him at home I bet he can come on for at least 10 minutes and I know he's
[04:05.800 --> 04:11.000]  busy short notice about this Muslim ring Obama wears and I actually went and
[04:11.000 --> 04:15.000]  looked it up so did Michael Schneider of American Dream blog it's up at info
[04:15.000 --> 04:22.760]  wars.com Obama carries a bunch of charms some of them a cultic you name it
[04:22.760 --> 04:26.120]  show when I heard that on man Cal this morning when looked it up I was like
[04:26.120 --> 04:33.840]  wait a minute it's not just the Muslim there is no God but Allah or ring but
[04:33.840 --> 04:38.960]  it's all these other little charms and goodies so we're gonna be breaking that
[04:38.960 --> 04:45.000]  down and they're also talking about a new Iran terror alert in New York so
[04:45.000 --> 04:50.560]  they're trying to hype all that up and yeah US troops are mashing in and around
[04:50.560 --> 04:55.480]  Syria so that is now going into high gear and you know the Syrians I have one
[04:55.480 --> 05:00.800]  other airplanes brought down by F-16s made it land in Turkey the worst drought
[05:00.800 --> 05:04.840]  in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half
[05:04.840 --> 05:09.640]  year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only
[05:09.640 --> 05:13.880]  corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising
[05:13.880 --> 05:17.640]  prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of

[08:56.960 --> 09:02.000]  course a HBO television talk show and of course previous to that he had one on
[09:02.000 --> 09:06.400]  broadcast television politically incorrect pretty pretty shocking
[09:06.400 --> 09:09.160]  statement that we're going to be getting into just showing where these
[09:09.160 --> 09:13.160]  people are coming from and how does anybody call them liberal I would call
[09:13.160 --> 09:19.200]  them anti-human also this report is again up at info wars calm prison body
[09:19.200 --> 09:27.240]  calm and drugs report calm coming next TSA shock bracelets coming next TSA shock
[09:27.240 --> 09:37.680]  bracelets this is the type of stuff that we are covering here on the broadcast
[09:37.680 --> 09:44.360]  today we are also going to open the phones up but I need to get into this
[09:44.360 --> 09:49.840]  first and I know we're covering this it's in US news in European news but it's
[09:49.840 --> 09:57.160]  still kind of back of the paper that oh there's a crisis in Syria and oh we just
[09:57.160 --> 10:01.960]  want the people there to be free and safe and oh isn't Assad terrible he's
[10:01.960 --> 10:06.640]  being mean to the peaceful protesters we heard that nine months ago and the last
[10:06.640 --> 10:11.280]  three or four months they went well the free Syrian army are rebels but they're
[10:11.280 --> 10:14.760]  trying to bring freedom and you'll kick out the Assad regime and then it turns
[10:14.760 --> 10:18.840]  out yeah about half of them are actually al-Qaeda and they fly al-Qaeda flags and
[10:18.840 --> 10:22.440]  they're blowing up churches and stuff but yeah it's the same group they put
[10:22.440 --> 10:27.200]  into Libya to you know take down that country and engage in ethnic cleansing
[10:27.200 --> 10:32.460]  of blacks and others I mean it's just it's so over the top Orwellian that we're
[10:32.460 --> 10:37.520]  being told give up our rights because of al-Qaeda but meanwhile the elements the
[10:37.520 --> 10:41.080]  criminal elements that have seized control of NATO and our government are
[10:41.080 --> 10:48.280]  using them to start a sectarian see a Shiite Sunni civil war it is just
[10:48.280 --> 10:55.720]  absolutely disgusting what's going on and it's meant to cause a big giant crisis
[10:55.720 --> 11:00.560]  so that the big banks can divert our attention from their economic implosion
[11:00.560 --> 11:04.720]  that's designed to be a takeover and make hundreds of billions a year off more
[11:04.720 --> 11:10.880]  weapon cells and bring down Syria and just wreck it as a stepping stone to go
[11:10.880 --> 11:15.640]  into Iran and that's the policy that's going on and we can't even get the
[11:15.640 --> 11:20.080]  media to admit this is a war I mean they call it a police action they call it a
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.320]  humanitarian it's not a humanitarian to be now into day nine or is it day 10 I
[11:24.320 --> 11:30.960]  know it started like last Thursday of or don't know last Wednesday so how many
[11:30.960 --> 11:33.880]  days seven eight nine days I don't know how many days of the showing been going
[11:33.880 --> 11:38.960]  on it's at least eight days now that is so incredibly immoral in the name of oh
[11:38.960 --> 11:44.920]  a few mortars have gotten shot over into some villages and then the media says
[11:44.920 --> 11:48.560]  oh Syria says they did it in serious we never said that and there's no proof they
[11:48.560 --> 11:52.160]  ever said it that's the telltale sign what that's how Hitler started World
[11:52.160 --> 11:56.520]  War two in Poland he said Poland kept attacking German forces and it turned out
[11:56.520 --> 12:00.400]  it was stage the Germans were attacking their own bases and shooting news real
[12:00.400 --> 12:05.960]  footage of it called Operation Hemler and you know the Spanish didn't really
[12:05.960 --> 12:12.760]  attack us in 1898 to start the Spanish you know war that we had the Spanish
[12:12.760 --> 12:19.360]  American War but so many other countries have done similar things Spain has
[12:19.360 --> 12:25.080]  staged stuff to go after the Basque before this is just the main toolbox
[12:25.080 --> 12:31.440]  tool and militaries get into this because if you go back thousands of years ago
[12:31.440 --> 12:36.520]  even to Alexander the Great he would send in a small contingent of cavalry or
[12:36.520 --> 12:43.160]  infantry to draw out the larger enemy force say into a valley or into a low
[12:43.160 --> 12:46.240]  lying area so they could come down from high ground on them that's just a
[12:46.240 --> 12:53.400]  classic primitive military strategy or stratagem and you would get your
[12:53.400 --> 12:58.640]  smaller force of say 500 infantry or cavalry wiped out but that was bait to
[12:58.640 --> 13:04.400]  just bring in the larger force and then your army wins and you'd lose 10,000 less
[13:04.400 --> 13:09.840]  soldiers than you would have and the argument is in justifies the means we
[13:09.840 --> 13:16.240]  killed 500 of our troops to draw out the enemy show that 10,000 didn't die and
[13:16.240 --> 13:20.280]  then that's how you get false flags that's how these arguments work for the
[13:20.280 --> 13:26.320]  point of they put neocons on C-span you know shang a World Bank officials we
[13:26.320 --> 13:31.520]  played this again just earlier this week shang we need to stage something blow
[13:31.520 --> 13:35.880]  something up and blame it on our end or we need to start bombing them and then
[13:35.880 --> 13:39.280]  say it's an accident to get a war going and and that's what they're doing
[13:39.280 --> 13:45.080]  clearly with Syria and again it is incredibly immoral on top of it even
[13:45.080 --> 13:47.840]  if you're cold-blooded and think well you know we're an American Empire we're
[13:47.840 --> 13:52.120]  gonna control that region and get the oil and gas they get the oil and gas to
[13:52.120 --> 13:56.560]  create a monopoly to keep the prices high while having policies here that the
[13:56.560 --> 13:59.200]  oil companies actually have been caught running not environmentalists they're
[13:59.200 --> 14:04.520]  they're useful front people even AP's reported on this they sued 10 years ago
[14:04.520 --> 14:08.520]  to get the documents we've covered that at nauseam where they they want gas
[14:08.520 --> 14:12.840]  prices higher and they want to shut down refineries and not build new ones to
[14:12.840 --> 14:17.440]  have a bottleneck so see the good old boys sometimes will you know when I'm
[14:17.440 --> 14:20.400]  walking down the street they'll shake my hand they'll go but listen you know I'm
[14:20.400 --> 14:24.600]  an engineer I've been in Iraq off and on for five years and I'm making a couple
[14:24.600 --> 14:30.040]  hundred thousand a year we need that oil and I go really what do you do here
[14:30.040 --> 14:34.000]  building buildings because if you're American there's not many US oil companies
[14:34.000 --> 14:36.840]  there it's foreign oil companies that were given the oil rights wasn't it
[14:36.840 --> 14:41.640]  well yeah that's actually true so you're here telling me hey Alex we got the oil
[14:41.640 --> 14:45.840]  like hey we're pirates yeah it was all but I've been told this probably 20 times
[14:45.840 --> 14:49.520]  by good old boys on the streets who think come on man you know we're getting
[14:49.520 --> 14:54.400]  the oil I'm like yeah we're not getting the oil we're paying for the globalists
[14:54.400 --> 14:57.800]  to get the oil to then keep the prices high because when they get the oil and
[14:57.800 --> 15:02.600]  restrict its flow they get higher profits see people think more all more
[15:02.600 --> 15:08.080]  money no their diamonds are semi precious on the scale they're semi
[15:08.080 --> 15:12.000]  precious they lay all over the ground in Africa for heaven's sakes that's why
[15:12.000 --> 15:17.360]  there's one price for industrial one price for the bobble market things that
[15:17.360 --> 15:21.120]  are really rare things like rubies and things that's why the rich don't really
[15:21.120 --> 15:26.600]  wear diamonds anymore they're not into them it and De Beers the Oppenheimers
[15:26.600 --> 15:32.400]  they control the countries that have it to create a artificial scarcity so that's
[15:32.400 --> 15:37.480]  the point is we're paying for this paying to radicalize the Middle East and
[15:37.480 --> 15:41.080]  then when I don't want to attack these countries in a few years well they're
[15:41.080 --> 15:44.440]  already attacking Libya a year after they quote freed it saying oh my gosh
[15:44.440 --> 15:48.840]  Al Qaeda is there well yeah the Al Qaeda you put in so if they if they topple
[15:48.840 --> 15:54.000]  Assad and then they topple Iran who knows what we'll get out of it and then
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.080]  that'll be fine with the globalist they'll have new enemies to fight that
[15:57.080 --> 16:02.680]  are even worse and then the good old boys say well them Arabs always are just
[16:02.680 --> 16:06.480]  killing each other let them kill each other it's such an immoral statement
[16:06.480 --> 16:10.280]  because the globalist even if you like killing Arabs and even if this was a
[16:10.280 --> 16:14.640]  racial empire that was having some victory over people which it's not you
[16:14.640 --> 16:18.840]  need to understand that's all a pipe dream the globalist are using the Al
[16:18.840 --> 16:23.840]  Qaeda Wahhabist jihadi threat to re-engineer our once free society and
[16:23.840 --> 16:28.840]  overthrow private property rights the freedom of the press religion I mean
[16:28.840 --> 16:33.480]  they're dismantling everything and all of the FEMA and Homeland Security
[16:33.480 --> 16:39.480]  Trading Manuals that are public there isn't a word about Al Qaeda I remember
[16:39.480 --> 16:42.760]  ten years ago we were covering community events with the FBI would say come out
[16:42.760 --> 16:46.360]  and help after 9-11 you know get together to watch in our community and it
[16:46.360 --> 16:49.440]  was in the news you'd get there be two-day event we sent reporters to some
[16:49.440 --> 16:53.380]  of them the Ritters here locally with their local access show went and got it
[16:53.380 --> 16:58.600]  and you'd get there a two-day event at the get this video somewhere around the
[16:58.600 --> 17:02.560]  office we played it before they'll do a report on that it was in Austin it's the
[17:02.560 --> 17:05.280]  same manuals all over the country just different you know they put a Texas stamp
[17:05.280 --> 17:09.600]  on the manual here and then a you know a New York stamp in New York but it
[17:09.600 --> 17:14.960]  openly said you go you get doughnuts the first you know day orientation they
[17:14.960 --> 17:18.160]  show you Al Qaeda training tapes oh Al Qaeda is gonna get us and they go now
[17:18.160 --> 17:22.680]  let's segue into homegrown extremists and 90 plus percent of the course this
[17:22.680 --> 17:28.000]  is like 10 years ago is on homegrown groups and militias and evil gun owners
[17:28.000 --> 17:33.360]  and and and how the returning veterans are dangerous and that was 10 years ago
[17:33.360 --> 17:36.640]  by three and a half years ago it's the veterans are the number one threat and
[17:36.640 --> 17:40.760]  they're terrorists and George Washington's bad I mean it's ridiculous so
[17:40.760 --> 17:45.600]  while you're being told hey we're doing all this to fight Al Qaeda the globalist
[17:45.600 --> 17:49.360]  run Al Qaeda and look here's the news on the Turkey front I mean this could
[17:49.360 --> 17:54.080]  easily move into a larger regional war well it's already a regional war the
[17:54.080 --> 17:57.240]  sect death has said Secretary of Defense it could be a very dangerous regional
[17:57.240 --> 18:01.920]  war that could trigger a larger war Russian troops are now battling US and
[18:01.920 --> 18:07.040]  NATO and British and other troops but under NATO they're now battling and we
[18:07.040 --> 18:09.840]  known it's been going on for four months of the nine months but but now it's
[18:09.840 --> 18:16.960]  confirmed heavy reinforcements of Marines US Army CIA commandos Delta units
[18:16.960 --> 18:22.480]  Green Berets Army Rangers it's on with Russian Spitznets I mean it's on right
[18:22.480 --> 18:28.560]  now our country is at war with Russia right now now if you don't think that's a
[18:28.560 --> 18:33.440]  big deal okay and preemptively starting it with them that's Russia's only port
[18:33.440 --> 18:37.320]  in the Mediterranean they've been there forever Russia is in a non-aggressive
[18:37.320 --> 18:41.360]  posture the globalists are trying to overthrow their elections in their
[18:41.360 --> 18:49.040]  country getting the Russians back in a militarized capacity when meanwhile the
[18:49.040 --> 18:52.400]  banks are the people that have captured our country and they're trying to
[18:52.400 --> 18:56.120]  capture Russia see they want to destroy Russia they want to destroy America they
[18:56.120 --> 19:00.440]  want to destroy Syria oh and believe me that's why most Israeli experts say they
[19:00.440 --> 19:03.080]  don't want this to happen it's going to end up destroying Israel down the road
[19:03.080 --> 19:08.640]  and and make no mistake the EU and some of these factions they don't want Israel
[19:08.640 --> 19:13.600]  there there's not just the pro-Israel faction ladies and gentlemen I mean this
[19:13.600 --> 19:19.280]  is sophisticated this is biblical type stuff and you know I don't even address
[19:19.280 --> 19:23.840]  it from that perspective but I mean I'm always saying oh no you know price comes
[19:23.840 --> 19:27.880]  back I bet it's a thousand years from now a lot of stuff's got to happen it's
[19:27.880 --> 19:32.080]  really starting to creep me out I mean it's it's it's the genetic engineering
[19:32.080 --> 19:36.440]  all of it the kids wearing chips to go to school thumb printing to buy and sell
[19:36.440 --> 19:40.040]  cash being banned Louisiana for secondhand sales the farms being
[19:40.040 --> 19:43.640]  attacked the world government churches all over the US were moving their
[19:43.640 --> 19:50.360]  crosses I mean it's just insane and Turkey's now grounding passenger jets
[19:50.360 --> 19:54.600]  from Syria and beating up the passengers I mean this is in the news I mean they
[19:54.600 --> 19:58.720]  are really trying to get Syria to do something and the Russians are there I
[19:58.720 --> 20:03.320]  mean unbelievable the worst drought in 50 years continues and the first six
[20:03.320 --> 20:08.000]  months of 2012 marks the hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn

[20:12.360 --> 20:16.440]  and wheat are all impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is
[20:16.440 --> 20:19.720]  forcing farmers and ranchers out of business blowing up your food prices

[20:24.280 --> 20:28.440]  by getting your own supply of foods for me foods direct now as the price of raw
[20:28.440 --> 20:32.120]  ingredients increases eat foods will have to raise prices to now is the time

[24:49.140 --> 24:53.980]  Taser is a registered trademark and is also a product manufactured only by Taser

[24:58.860 --> 25:03.340]  Taser bracelet nor do we manufacture a device that resembles or could be used
[25:03.340 --> 25:08.460]  as a bracelet the device should be classified as a stun gun bracelet and
[25:08.460 --> 25:13.460]  not a Taser bracelet oh we're sorry you don't call it a Taser you call it a
[25:13.460 --> 25:20.260]  stun gun bracelet can you please immediately correct the headline and
[25:20.260 --> 25:24.260]  the story by the way guys grab the video with the Homeland Security promo about
[25:24.260 --> 25:28.180]  the shot bracelets can you please immediately correct the headline and
[25:28.180 --> 25:32.100]  the story by removing any reference to Taser brand products in the future
[25:32.100 --> 25:36.420]  please describe it generally by stating it as a stun gun no we've changed the
[25:36.420 --> 25:42.700]  headline to shock bracelet or electric shock bracelet if you would like to talk
[25:42.700 --> 25:46.460]  about this more please feel free to contact me Stacy Todd communications
[25:46.460 --> 25:51.100]  assistant Stacy thank you for your kind letter we know you're freaked out by
[25:51.100 --> 25:54.340]  this because it's linked to drudgereport.com but let me just publicly
[25:54.340 --> 25:57.900]  address this right now because it gets into a bunch of different issues then
[25:57.900 --> 26:02.780]  we'll go to break it back into the news and go to your calls I just changed Paul
[26:02.780 --> 26:08.100]  Watson's headline not because I think Paul Watson's wrong but because this time
[26:08.100 --> 26:12.940]  you were friendly when your lawyers two years ago sent us a threatening tort
[26:12.940 --> 26:18.460]  letter I didn't call my lawyer I got on the phone with your head lawyer not your
[26:18.460 --> 26:24.340]  assistant person at Taser International in Scottsdale in Arizona and I said
[26:24.340 --> 26:28.180]  because they sent us a letter saying don't use Taser period it's trademark
[26:28.180 --> 26:32.620]  it's not trademark in free speech news headlines and just like Google has
[26:32.620 --> 26:38.220]  become ubiquitous with search engines you have become ubiquitous with
[26:38.220 --> 26:44.900]  electroshock devices and tasers have been medically proven that they're
[26:44.900 --> 26:48.420]  causing heart attacks and you've upped the power and I'm all for people having
[26:48.420 --> 26:54.420]  tasers is self-defense I frankly I own one I don't think weapons are bad but I
[26:54.420 --> 27:00.180]  think that I think their misuse is so I don't think tasers the issue here but I
[27:00.180 --> 27:03.500]  told their lawyer that and I said but I don't like you trying to stomp on my
[27:03.500 --> 27:07.380]  first amendment I want you to apologize right now and say I shouldn't have got
[27:07.380 --> 27:11.160]  this letter the lawyer said you're absolutely right mr. Jones I said you
[27:11.160 --> 27:13.940]  need to stop sending these letters out to thousands of people which they
[27:13.940 --> 27:17.580]  admitted telling them don't use our name Taser when most people are ignorant
[27:17.580 --> 27:22.660]  think oh my god I can't say Taser in stories about tasers because oh my gosh
[27:22.660 --> 27:26.820]  I got a letter that's their copyright that's their trademark well I'll say it
[27:26.820 --> 27:32.420]  Taser Taser Taser Taser Taser Taser Taser I listen trademarks go back to
[27:32.420 --> 27:37.020]  England 500 years ago for those that don't know they had it before in Rome but
[27:37.020 --> 27:42.100]  the modern trademark system was with beer and alcohol wine whiskey scotch
[27:42.100 --> 27:45.580]  people knew hey that's a good little barrel of that that's a good bottle of
[27:45.580 --> 27:49.220]  that there was a mark on it and and shysters would go out and put a mark on
[27:49.220 --> 27:53.460]  their crud and so the courts ruled no you can't use that mark unless it's yours
[27:53.460 --> 27:59.100]  so I can't sell electronics and put the Sony logo or name on it I can't go open
[27:59.100 --> 28:03.540]  a hamburger place and put the golden arches up but as a radio talk show host
[28:03.540 --> 28:09.700]  and as a writer and a researcher we can use the word Taser and by the way they
[28:09.700 --> 28:13.340]  manufactured one of the bracelets that's been looked at by Homeland Security
[28:13.340 --> 28:17.740]  and if I want to call a shock bracelet a Taser bracelet I'll call it that now
[28:17.740 --> 28:25.980]  technically I think it's better to say coming next TSA electric shock bracelets
[28:25.980 --> 28:29.820]  that's that's that's even more for people that don't get it because people
[28:29.820 --> 28:34.100]  gotten dumbed down about the word Taser like the someone's been dazed is the
[28:34.100 --> 28:39.500]  semantical linguistic manipulation there no no no how about how about police
[28:39.500 --> 28:43.140]  killing people with high-powered cattle prods and why have they increased the
[28:43.140 --> 28:48.900]  power of electrocution devices that you should only use as the next step towards
[28:48.900 --> 28:55.140]  a firearm in a danger continuum somebody is swinging a club at you you're a cop
[28:55.140 --> 29:00.060]  you got a right to shoot them but maybe you want to be restrained as a peace officer
[29:00.060 --> 29:05.060]  and just Taser them before you kill them because you don't want you know to have
[29:05.060 --> 29:08.340]  that on your hands just cuz some guys drunk or whatever and swinging a club
[29:08.340 --> 29:12.660]  around but frankly club will kill you I'd probably just shoot somebody but the
[29:12.660 --> 29:17.940]  point is that is that okay use the Taser don't use it on a woman that argues
[29:17.940 --> 29:20.900]  with you on the side of the road don't use it on somebody who won't pee in a
[29:20.900 --> 29:24.340]  cup who's trapped down at the hospital in courts rule that can torture I'm sick
[29:24.340 --> 29:31.180]  of your legitimate product being used to torture people so don't fret well this
[29:31.180 --> 29:35.300]  isn't a threat so I nicely because I think it's even better headline changed
[29:35.300 --> 29:38.980]  it but not because of your letter but because I thought it even better
[29:38.980 --> 29:43.140]  headline the way I just put it and changed it okay so there you go and
[29:43.140 --> 29:47.220]  and it's a First Amendment issue a lot of people aren't using the word Taser
[29:47.220 --> 29:51.140]  because they're threatening them and that's wrong we're on the march the
[29:51.140 --> 29:58.380]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[32:09.900 --> 32:13.580]  fermented foods like sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on
[32:13.580 --> 32:17.460]  life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria but frankly I'm not
[32:17.460 --> 32:20.580]  sure what the food police are so afraid of these remarkable foods have been
[32:20.580 --> 32:23.500]  around since the beginning of history with archaeological evidence for
[32:23.500 --> 32:26.700]  fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every
[32:26.700 --> 32:31.340]  culture even today Japanese eat miso Africans eat fermented porges Koreans
[32:31.340 --> 32:35.420]  eat kamichi and in India fermented milk is a staple for healthy living but here's
[32:35.420 --> 32:38.900]  some good news South for Lion Americans can now discover the secrets to making
[32:38.900 --> 32:42.620]  these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes since
[32:42.620 --> 32:45.900]  it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself for
[32:45.900 --> 32:48.740]  more information check out fermentation factor dot com that's
[32:48.740 --> 32:52.660]  fermentation factor dot com it's easy to create your own powerful fermented
[32:52.660 --> 32:56.900]  foods and you can do it by going to www.fermentationfactor.com that's

[33:21.900 --> 33:50.340]  and just as our technologies are godlike compared to a deer or something that
[33:50.340 --> 33:58.940]  we're hunting or a grizzly bear or elk or a good zeal or a African lion a Indian
[33:58.940 --> 34:04.540]  tiger the globalist have godlike weapons and technologies that we paid for that
[34:04.540 --> 34:09.220]  our minds design that they're now using against us and they've done the
[34:09.220 --> 34:14.860]  population down to just an incredible level where people don't know what
[34:14.860 --> 34:19.460]  their rights are people have no idea what their basic liberties are they have
[34:19.460 --> 34:23.420]  no idea that we're already in by and large a global private corporate
[34:23.420 --> 34:28.980]  government that is mopping up less than 10 rogue nations right now and again I
[34:28.980 --> 34:32.180]  don't want to live in Syria under the Assad regime I mean compared to his dad
[34:32.180 --> 34:36.500]  he's a nice guy he's a good guy compared to Gaddafi Gaddafi's a good guy
[34:36.500 --> 34:40.980]  compared to Al Qaeda it's really a lesser of evils and they're trying to
[34:40.980 --> 34:44.380]  destroy states that are trying to become truly progressive and work with the
[34:44.380 --> 34:48.500]  West and places where women go to college and don't have to wear hoods over
[34:48.500 --> 34:52.180]  their heads and where they don't sexually mutilate people and those are all
[34:52.180 --> 34:54.820]  the countries the globalists are overthrowing which has always been the
[34:54.820 --> 34:58.820]  British policy to put the better ones basically and I'm not knocking all the
[34:58.820 --> 35:03.060]  better ones but the radical better ones in charge that's the jihadis out of
[35:03.060 --> 35:07.540]  Saudi Arabia they're the army Saudi Arabia is allied with the globalist and
[35:07.540 --> 35:12.860]  it's of course they used a group to take the blame for 9-11 so the globalist
[35:12.860 --> 35:16.540]  could enslave us here to then make the deal later this was written about
[35:16.540 --> 35:22.980]  decades ago to give the Middle East to Saudi Arabia I mean Saudi Arabia ladies
[35:22.980 --> 35:27.860]  and gentlemen is incredibly powerful I've read Wall Street Journal articles on
[35:27.860 --> 35:32.580]  air people have taken it out of context when I've pointed out that the rich
[35:32.580 --> 35:41.820]  Saudi families predominantly are now some of the biggest owners of TV radio
[35:41.820 --> 35:48.860]  news and film production I don't think you can say they control it but to a
[35:48.860 --> 35:52.860]  great extent they are no more and more owning it like news core in things I mean
[35:52.860 --> 35:56.340]  those are facts and people don't know that and that's not a demonization of
[35:56.340 --> 36:01.820]  Muslims and Arabs in general who I think have been demonized unfairly there is a
[36:01.820 --> 36:08.220]  larger global strategy to radicalize but I mean look at look at Iraq I mean
[36:08.220 --> 36:12.580]  Saddam was trained by the CIA in 1958 that's declassified he was sent over to
[36:12.580 --> 36:16.820]  try to overthrow the bathest progressive party I don't mean progressive in the
[36:16.820 --> 36:23.180]  you know the communist sense but it was more socialist and then they made him
[36:23.180 --> 36:27.580]  head of security and then he became dictator in 79 and the West funded him
[36:27.580 --> 36:33.820]  30 plus billion to attack Iran and again the globalists are trying to
[36:33.820 --> 36:38.780]  destabilize every nation-state that's why they're paying to ship our jobs
[36:38.780 --> 36:43.740]  overseas while working to collapse China at the same time because they're
[36:43.740 --> 36:48.220]  outside the countries the globalist or corporations playing nations off against
[36:48.220 --> 36:52.180]  each other to consolidate their corporate power which is not the
[36:52.180 --> 36:57.260]  corporation down the street from you that you know does after-school
[36:57.260 --> 37:02.500]  charities you know sports teams because all the left who isn't really the left
[37:02.500 --> 37:05.940]  as you'll see coming up the next hour they're a bunch of sickening eugenicist
[37:05.940 --> 37:14.620]  monsters posing as as as bleeding hearts and they think any corporation or any
[37:14.620 --> 37:20.540]  money's bad that isn't in their pocket they're just robbers they're they're
[37:20.540 --> 37:27.580]  pirates they're they're a gang who have giant mobs of moronic people who who've
[37:27.580 --> 37:31.660]  been dumbed down from birth and don't not offend for themselves that can you
[37:31.660 --> 37:36.500]  know do you know just demand their goodies whether it's Venezuela or
[37:36.500 --> 37:39.620]  whether it's the United States it's shameful we know what dependency does
[37:39.620 --> 37:42.540]  it's ugly
[37:43.740 --> 37:50.100]  adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters Victor Hugo French statements
[37:50.100 --> 37:56.860]  statesmen and philosophers one of my favorite quotes because it's true I mean
[37:56.860 --> 38:03.340]  old-timers my dad's dad knew how to fix a combine with pieces of rubber band and
[38:03.340 --> 38:07.660]  a tin can and would rebuild things because because you just couldn't get a
[38:07.660 --> 38:13.100]  part delivered in a month and he didn't have the money and he had to make it
[38:13.100 --> 38:17.860]  work and my dad you know just from tinkering as a child could like I have
[38:17.860 --> 38:22.140]  a robot r2d to break when I was 10 and he'd open it up with a soldering iron and
[38:22.140 --> 38:26.620]  find it and fix it an hour you know I mean my dad could pull over on the side
[38:26.620 --> 38:30.460]  of the road and change somebody's tire in three minutes like it was NASCAR or
[38:30.460 --> 38:33.900]  something I've had flat tires takes me like an hour out there to figure it out
[38:33.900 --> 38:38.100]  and get it up and everything and I know more than general public I hear people
[38:38.100 --> 38:40.580]  I was just talking to David night the other night and I've heard this so many
[38:40.580 --> 38:43.740]  times from callers and people on the street but he was doing an interview for
[38:43.740 --> 38:48.380]  TV up there was talking to a lady because he's been a media fellow at a
[38:48.380 --> 38:54.060]  Institute and you're out talking to people and you're like hey well you
[38:54.060 --> 38:58.860]  what's your favorite power system then since you want to shut down a cold they
[38:58.860 --> 39:03.180]  go why like electricity it's clean you're like well did you know 51 to 52%
[39:03.180 --> 39:08.340]  of your electricity comes from coal I mean I talked to people they literally
[39:08.340 --> 39:15.660]  don't know where food comes from they'll say you should ban hunting it's mean to
[39:15.660 --> 39:19.260]  kill an animal and I've been sitting there at a dinner table with someone
[39:19.260 --> 39:23.260]  while they're eating chicken or beef I'm going do you know the life cycle of
[39:23.260 --> 39:27.900]  that animal at least the beef was out on a pasture and only had maybe an hour of
[39:27.900 --> 39:32.100]  hearing other cows being hit in the head with big gas bolts and killed having
[39:32.100 --> 39:35.620]  their throat slit and blood out in a big robot like machine grabs them by the
[39:35.620 --> 39:39.500]  legs and brings them up in the ceiling out of a horror movie I've been in a
[39:39.500 --> 39:43.900]  slaughterhouse before and let me tell you it's pretty hellish the point is that
[39:43.900 --> 39:48.180]  hey you know that chicken lives in a cage with mites all over it fed drugs and
[39:48.180 --> 39:52.220]  and antibiotics to keep it alive in a horrible place you've got to wear a
[39:52.220 --> 39:55.660]  breathing mask when you're in there
[39:55.980 --> 39:59.660]  see I've grown up in and around farms and I've been with friends repeatedly and
[39:59.660 --> 40:03.140]  they've got hold on I got to pull over here and pick up a trailer low to this
[40:03.140 --> 40:07.100]  turkey crap and take it and dump it before you know we get on down the road
[40:07.100 --> 40:10.340]  and go hunting and you pull in like put this mask on you want to see something
[40:10.340 --> 40:14.500]  but I'm you're like whoa I mean I don't want animals actually treated like that
[40:14.500 --> 40:19.060]  I think we should have some basic rules and pay more so that but but instead
[40:19.060 --> 40:23.020]  they're not gonna do that they're using animal rights to shut down small farms
[40:23.020 --> 40:27.060]  and ranches that are incredibly humane so that big factory farms can run
[40:27.060 --> 40:31.460]  everything and believe me folks if you hadn't been on one you don't know it is
[40:31.460 --> 40:36.740]  like a concentration camp on steroids and my point is hey okay you can say the
[40:36.740 --> 40:43.340]  chickens are dumb animals and they are the issue is we're eating that you ever
[40:43.340 --> 40:47.460]  tasted a really farm raised real chicken with it boiled down the broth it
[40:47.460 --> 40:50.660]  tastes completely different than what you think chicken is there's just
[40:50.660 --> 40:59.140]  flavorless blubber I remember what 15 years ago BBC reported on it and they
[40:59.140 --> 41:05.900]  showed it it's a chicken with four legs instead of wings so it had more meat on
[41:05.900 --> 41:09.820]  it but they decided that it was too hard to keep them alive oh and they didn't
[41:09.820 --> 41:14.340]  have a head I forgot that part they have a funnel where you just stick a funnel
[41:14.340 --> 41:18.620]  in a hole and then the chicken just grows up as a big blob and you think it's
[41:18.620 --> 41:23.060]  safe to genetically engineer something like that and then eat that we're
[41:23.060 --> 41:26.660]  already eating clone beef clone chicken you name it see that's supposedly what
[41:26.660 --> 41:29.660]  the Liberals don't like but they're never off fighting that they're too busy
[41:29.660 --> 41:33.260]  saying oh I don't think Fukushima's a problem there's too many people or or
[41:33.260 --> 41:36.900]  oh I'm a scientist and we got a new article out today yeah okay the GMO is
[41:36.900 --> 41:42.580]  sterilizing you where there's too many people they're really just a bunch of
[41:42.580 --> 41:49.700]  weird failures that are so angry at the world that they just hate everybody and
[41:49.700 --> 41:55.260]  they think if they had power everything would be okay you know I have
[41:55.260 --> 42:00.980]  personally been around a lot of these people and folks aren't happy that
[42:00.980 --> 42:05.180]  haven't been successful on their own I mean when you've been successful on
[42:05.180 --> 42:09.700]  your own it is extremely satisfying it is empowering not from a power trip
[42:09.700 --> 42:14.460]  perspective but from your meant to build you're meant to work you're meant to
[42:14.460 --> 42:18.700]  create you're meant to design you're meant to do the right thing you're meant
[42:18.700 --> 42:26.300]  to stand up and it's those points of adversity in my life and the times I
[42:26.300 --> 42:32.140]  did work you know 24 hours straight that are the most valuable to me now because
[42:32.140 --> 42:37.900]  that's when I was using my mind and and and and being somebody not to be somebody
[42:37.900 --> 42:44.620]  so your neighbor thinks you're cool but because you are somebody and I run into
[42:44.620 --> 42:48.660]  these unhappy empty people who who are even successful financially but
[42:48.660 --> 42:53.020]  successful through the fraud of the system successful through lies lying to
[42:53.020 --> 42:56.740]  themselves and they're just totally unhappy running around from this to that
[42:56.740 --> 43:02.500]  trying to find fulfillment and you're not going to find it of course people
[43:02.500 --> 43:07.260]  are unfulfilled and know something's wrong and and and are preparing even if
[43:07.260 --> 43:10.740]  they don't intellectually know why they're preparing because instinctively
[43:10.740 --> 43:15.780]  you know something's wrong because your conscious mind may be diverted and
[43:15.780 --> 43:19.260]  distracted but even the average dumbbell out there knows well wait a minute
[43:19.260 --> 43:22.700]  they're using radical Muslims out of Saudi Arabia and al-Qaeda to attack
[43:22.700 --> 43:28.620]  Syrian Libya but I'm told I need to give my rights up because of al-Qaeda even if
[43:28.620 --> 43:32.900]  you don't consciously register that your your subconscious that's around a
[43:32.900 --> 43:35.940]  hundred times on average they've done studies more powerful in your conscious
[43:35.940 --> 43:39.620]  I mean that's the real that's the brain the full brain you just can't
[43:39.620 --> 43:45.620]  consciously comprehend all of this because it's so big those of us that
[43:45.620 --> 43:50.060]  have opened up our minds and and focused and studied and and and gotten into real
[43:50.060 --> 43:55.860]  intellectual exercises it becomes so deliciously electric that it begins to
[43:55.860 --> 43:59.580]  open up the mind but then you become
[43:59.580 --> 44:09.860]  what do they call it when somebody is you know has a IQ is intelligent but they
[44:09.860 --> 44:15.620]  get a little weird what's the word for that eccentric yes that's the word well
[44:15.620 --> 44:19.740]  we all should be eccentric humans are meant to be complex multi-layered
[44:19.740 --> 44:25.860]  multifaceted people not decadent slobs eating genetically modified chicken
[44:25.860 --> 44:33.980]  pump full of hormones and and antibiotics that are destroying the floor in
[44:33.980 --> 44:38.460]  your stomach and giving you gut disorders on top of the vaccines and I'm
[44:38.460 --> 44:42.740]  ranting here's the toll-free number on any of the stuff I've raised we have the
[44:42.740 --> 44:47.340]  video coming up coming next TSA taser bracelets the videos in our article at
[44:47.340 --> 44:52.580]  info wars.com and also drugs report.com still has it it was up last night
[44:52.580 --> 44:56.420]  scroll down to the bottom of the left hand side you want to find it there and
[44:56.420 --> 45:00.780]  the Washington Times of course reported on it after we reported it back in 08 but
[45:00.780 --> 45:04.780]  now they're looking at it again and it's along with the other torture where they
[45:04.780 --> 45:07.740]  tell people you didn't go through the scanner I'm now going to punch you in
[45:07.740 --> 45:12.580]  the testicles or when they attack a congressman's genitals I'm sorry to
[45:12.580 --> 45:15.620]  mention this or when they stick things in your drinks after you've gone through
[45:15.620 --> 45:20.300]  and bought it inside the secure area of the airport stealing cash and and
[45:20.300 --> 45:25.100]  pleading guilty to it saying well I had to punish them we all do it the freeze
[45:25.100 --> 45:29.340]  orders I mean it's all part of the torture so we're gonna get into some
[45:29.340 --> 45:38.620]  of that and if you think they won't do this think again I remember in 1998 it's
[45:38.620 --> 45:45.140]  in my 1999 film police state 2000s free online we can buy the DVD if you want to
[45:45.140 --> 45:51.140]  have a high quality a better better no res version and support us at info or
[45:51.140 --> 45:55.340]  store.com evil capitalism we don't come take your money for some believe you just

[46:00.140 --> 46:04.900]  get the word out but that's a side issue you know the Austin American states
[46:04.900 --> 46:07.380]  when announced yeah they're putting microphones up around Austin their gun
[46:07.380 --> 46:09.940]  shot detectors and I went and looked up the company they said no it's it's a
[46:09.940 --> 46:13.700]  shotgun microphone to listen to people at 200 yards away and hooked into the
[46:13.700 --> 46:16.940]  threat fusion centers that they already had before 9-11 I just didn't call them
[46:16.940 --> 46:20.820]  that they called them threat integration centers and then I learned they put them
[46:20.820 --> 46:23.940]  up nationwide and now they just admit oh we're actually listening to you but
[46:23.940 --> 46:26.660]  they've never quote solve one crime with them because they don't even want to
[46:26.660 --> 46:31.540]  admit it into court because it's really part of a globalist takeover it's for
[46:31.540 --> 46:35.220]  political people they're going to get later it's not for criminals that they
[46:35.220 --> 46:38.940]  want to encourage so they can have a culture of crime to fill the biggest
[46:38.940 --> 46:43.260]  prison population in the world it's a crop of criminals they breed and have the
[46:43.260 --> 46:46.820]  rap culture tell them it's cool and and they have you dress in a way that the
[46:46.820 --> 46:50.660]  police are trained is the enemy uniform of a gangbanger so the police then go
[46:50.660 --> 46:54.860]  out in a programmed role game it's a game it's all war gaming they don't
[46:54.860 --> 46:57.860]  even consciously know that to look at what the commanders do to go out and
[46:57.860 --> 47:01.060]  then grab the people and throw them in the University of crime I mean it's all
[47:01.060 --> 47:04.940]  been actuaried out it's all been programmed out by the globalist masterminds
[47:04.940 --> 47:08.580]  and they phase it in it looks like they're total geniuses they are wicked
[47:08.580 --> 47:13.260]  and they are smart but it's phased in in upgrades and that's why it's so
[47:13.260 --> 47:18.980]  sophisticated and so hard to beat but
[47:20.900 --> 47:24.420]  you know if you don't think they'll do that they have now put in tell the
[47:24.420 --> 47:27.300]  streets and there's several other companies remember we covered this two
[47:27.300 --> 47:35.620]  years ago became a big national story and they have cameras and microphones in
[47:35.620 --> 47:39.220]  them and then I've confirmed they're here in town and I'm so conditioned even
[47:39.220 --> 47:43.140]  though I've gone and seen them and know they're there I haven't gone out with a
[47:43.140 --> 47:46.420]  news crew yet to do report on it because see I've even been conditioned I've
[47:46.420 --> 47:50.620]  known about this so long and was laughed at oh yeah I've been on national TV and
[47:50.620 --> 47:54.060]  radio shows they go oh I mean this is like seven eight years ago before it was
[47:54.060 --> 47:57.060]  even in the news it been in the news a little bit calling it gunshot detectors
[47:57.060 --> 48:01.220]  oh you're the guy that thinks the street lights are watching us that would
[48:01.220 --> 48:05.100]  never happen in America now it's like oh yeah Homeland Security billion here
[48:05.100 --> 48:08.220]  billion there putting in tens of thousands of street lights that watch
[48:08.220 --> 48:12.980]  you listen to you track you oh and grab your wireless communications and steal
[48:12.980 --> 48:18.940]  those and run it in wirelessly or into a cable box back to the globalist for
[48:18.940 --> 48:23.740]  processing and they built they built a little in assay substation they're gonna
[48:23.740 --> 48:27.420]  freak out when they know I've discovered this doesn't even have a fence around it
[48:27.420 --> 48:31.860]  outside Austin and I heard rumors of this and then snooped around and it is
[48:31.860 --> 48:36.260]  some kind of clandestine operation and and and it's got all these hubs coming
[48:36.260 --> 48:39.780]  out of it and water storage and stuff and I'm like man they've got in assay
[48:39.780 --> 48:43.900]  stuff down in San Antonio one almost as big as the giant complex in Utah and
[48:43.900 --> 48:49.020]  when they say oh well big giant snooper buildings you know the size of Mall of
[48:49.020 --> 48:53.380]  America or bigger that's nothing to worry about and then oh you know two
[48:53.380 --> 48:56.460]  models from my house some type of spook base well that's that's living in a
[48:56.460 --> 49:02.340]  free country and those spook bases folks they're watching you and I they're not
[49:02.340 --> 49:06.300]  worried about Al Qaeda they run and I mean that's what I'm saying we've got
[49:06.300 --> 49:11.420]  malevolent bad guys in control and the reason they can't fully take over is
[49:11.420 --> 49:15.100]  because there's so many good people in the military in the police departments in
[49:15.100 --> 49:18.860]  the fire departments in the bureaucracies and general citizens and there's good
[49:18.860 --> 49:22.180]  talk show host and there's a lot of good media people that know this is wrong but
[49:22.180 --> 49:25.820]  we better get past left and right and Romney and Obama even though it's fun
[49:25.820 --> 49:30.380]  to watch those two guys spar and go man we really are in trouble because here's
[49:30.380 --> 49:33.180]  the deal they're not just setting up some high-tech tyranny because they're
[49:33.180 --> 49:36.540]  worried about GMO and genetic engineering you getting out of control
[49:36.540 --> 49:39.780]  they're not just setting up a world government as they publicly say at
[49:39.780 --> 49:43.260]  higher levels oh we're doing this because of super weapons and disruptive
[49:43.260 --> 49:47.900]  technologies we've got to have a tyranny to protect humanity I would still be
[49:47.900 --> 49:50.780]  against that because that's always the excuse and bad guys end up taking it
[49:50.780 --> 49:54.540]  over even if it started good but it's not it didn't start good it's eugenics
[49:54.540 --> 49:58.980]  it's cold-blooded and they want to call us down to nothing and they're setting
[49:58.980 --> 50:02.900]  the kill grid up and all of you that serve the system you're not gonna have
[50:02.900 --> 50:06.900]  to wait it's always oh our kids our kids you know we let's do the right thing for
[50:06.900 --> 50:13.740]  our kids how about for you because it's just gonna get crazier the end of
[50:13.740 --> 50:17.500]  civilization as we know it a long emergency as it's been called a
[50:17.500 --> 50:22.180]  continued scientific degeneration all the globalist poses saviors from every
[50:22.180 --> 50:26.060]  angle as we die of cancer as we dive neurological disorders as it all goes
[50:26.060 --> 50:29.980]  off the charts they'll poses the saviors as heroes sucking the money out of us
[50:29.980 --> 50:33.820]  as the as the tasers go up in power and more people die that'll just be
[50:33.820 --> 50:37.660]  accepted as torture becomes more accepted I mean we're just being
[50:37.660 --> 50:44.020]  brutalized right now and it's gonna get worse so everybody serving this I mean I
[50:44.020 --> 50:47.460]  don't know if you knew what I knew you would immediately join the side of
[50:47.460 --> 50:50.300]  liberty and freedom and me against the globalist I mean there's really no
[50:50.300 --> 50:54.860]  choice but but there is a choice you are given a choice so I mean you better
[50:54.860 --> 50:59.260]  make one you better make one right now you better make a decision what you
[50:59.260 --> 51:03.820]  serve right now Aaron full in here as the food police shut down food co-ops the

[54:29.540 --> 54:34.260]  slaves and they talk about how all their dictatorships of the past have been
[54:34.260 --> 54:38.620]  overthrown so they have scientifically tried to forge something that is
[54:38.620 --> 54:42.980]  unstoppable and that's what the robots are all about they'll follow orders when
[54:42.980 --> 54:46.860]  troops won't that's what the drugging of the food and the water is about I mean
[54:46.860 --> 54:50.420]  we are all part of a giant experiment they don't just experiment on the US
[54:50.420 --> 54:53.780]  troops with deadly vaccines and stuff they don't just you know they spray
[54:53.780 --> 54:57.940]  st. Louis with nerve gas and kill people and then decades later it comes out and
[54:57.940 --> 55:02.820]  nobody gets in trouble you know that just came out last week people talking
[55:02.820 --> 55:08.060]  about yeah the day they sprayed my daddy died I mean this is killing people and
[55:08.060 --> 55:12.740]  and notice they never get in trouble well who are they who authorizes this I
[55:12.740 --> 55:17.580]  covered it last night on the air in fact guys will you bring me the news stack
[55:17.580 --> 55:22.340]  from last night I left it in there on the broadcast studio because I people
[55:22.340 --> 55:26.860]  actually went and got us code title 50 chapter 32 subsection 1,528
[55:26.860 --> 55:33.580]  paragraph B where it says oh you can't test on people and then you get down
[55:33.580 --> 55:37.220]  there but if it's for law enforcement purposes or scientific or any form of
[55:37.220 --> 55:44.260]  government research we can kill you I mean the government says they can kill
[55:44.260 --> 55:49.940]  us I mean that's how they get scientists to you know put a little foster kid in
[55:49.940 --> 55:55.780]  a radiation tank and fry them and again people like man that's so morbid well
[55:55.780 --> 56:00.420]  you know what see I'm offended by Halloween signs of demons and goblins
[56:00.420 --> 56:04.420]  because my four-year-old doesn't like it and I I know enough about death and I've
[56:04.420 --> 56:07.740]  I've seen death and I don't like it I'm like you know what they'll be enough for
[56:07.740 --> 56:12.500]  that when I'm dead in the grave for a million years you understand it's not
[56:12.500 --> 56:15.820]  that I'm a wimp it's because I'm the opposite I don't like skulls and death
[56:15.820 --> 56:20.900]  because I've I've I really know what it is and let me tell you I've made a
[56:20.900 --> 56:25.940]  friend of it but it doesn't mean I'm rushing to get there but then people are
[56:25.940 --> 56:28.620]  always on us those that love death and destruction think it's cool they're
[56:28.620 --> 56:31.900]  like oh I don't want to hear about abortion I don't want to see photos of
[56:31.900 --> 56:35.500]  dead babies oh but you support it oh I don't want do you think we like it
[56:35.500 --> 56:40.500]  showing it to you it hurts us to we would we've got to get this out in the
[56:40.500 --> 56:47.340]  open of wherever gonna stop this because when we treat animals bad we end up
[56:47.340 --> 56:51.740]  treating humans bad and we treat humans bad we really treat humans bad to the
[56:51.740 --> 56:58.140]  point of now in them in jails a woman taken in for you know unpaid speeding
[56:58.140 --> 57:01.980]  tickets and you have a miscarriage they take your dead baby right in front of
[57:01.980 --> 57:04.980]  you throw it in the toilet and flush it and laugh at you and why do those guys
[57:04.980 --> 57:09.060]  always laugh because they have to they have to make it all a joke the
[57:09.060 --> 57:13.620]  dehumanization they're part of when you dehumanize somebody you dehumanize
[57:13.620 --> 57:18.580]  yourself I've been around people that have been in the ghetto I've gone many
[57:18.580 --> 57:23.300]  times as a child every Christmas we went and in other holidays down to South
[57:23.300 --> 57:26.780]  Dallas the one of the worst areas in the country and my mother would make you
[57:26.780 --> 57:30.340]  know hundreds of sandwiches and soup and we'd go and serve it to him at the
[57:30.340 --> 57:35.020]  Salvation Army and we'd stay there sometimes all day and you know what it
[57:35.020 --> 57:38.580]  didn't make me feel superior being around all those pathetic people but I've
[57:38.580 --> 57:41.460]  been around these yuppies and these social workers and some of them they
[57:41.460 --> 57:45.540]  like the fact that they're around dumb people they that makes them feel big you
[57:45.540 --> 57:49.020]  know what it doesn't make me feel big makes me feel low makes me feel bad makes
[57:49.020 --> 57:52.740]  me feel dirty it makes me feel sad for humanity because them sinking down means
[57:52.740 --> 57:55.900]  I'm sinking down too and it means my kids are gonna live in a world that's
[57:55.900 --> 58:01.900]  sinking instead of rising I want humanity rising not sinking it really
[58:01.900 --> 58:13.500]  comes down to that and let me tell you we're sinking and we're sinking fast and
[58:13.500 --> 58:17.980]  I tell you adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters my kids are
[58:17.980 --> 58:21.180]  great but they are spoiled and you know what they have not they've done some
[58:21.180 --> 58:24.700]  charity stuff but it didn't have to you know what this Christmas they're gonna
[58:24.700 --> 58:29.020]  go get to go spend a couple days in the ghetto I think I think that's the answer
[58:29.020 --> 58:36.060]  it really is the answer how much you go visit kids in the state hospital folks

[1:02:54.980 --> 1:02:58.540]  activity any purpose that is directly related to protection against toxic
[1:02:58.540 --> 1:03:01.820]  chemicals so they got to kill people to know what the chemicals do or biological
[1:03:01.820 --> 1:03:04.820]  weapons and agents or any law enforcement purpose including any
[1:03:04.820 --> 1:03:08.140]  purpose related to riot control including if you get into this lethal
[1:03:08.140 --> 1:03:15.500]  munitions so you might want to actually go check that out yourself that's how
[1:03:15.500 --> 1:03:20.100]  the system is doing stuff like this and I tell you every time I mention this
[1:03:20.100 --> 1:03:24.660]  fools comment or they send emails the office I'm showing going this is a
[1:03:24.660 --> 1:03:33.460]  prohibition on it well yeah it's lawyer speak US code title 50 chapter 1520
[1:03:33.460 --> 1:03:42.780]  starts out in chapter 32 biological warfare program section 1520 and it's
[1:03:42.780 --> 1:03:46.900]  got prohibitions and it says you can't do it for any reason unless we say so
[1:03:46.900 --> 1:03:51.700]  like the UN and its Charter of Rights Declaration of Human Rights there's 30
[1:03:51.700 --> 1:03:57.060]  points ratified and signed on by all the nations and up till 29 I mean it's got
[1:03:57.060 --> 1:04:00.940]  rights that the communists promise you know North Korea they promise free houses
[1:04:00.940 --> 1:04:05.820]  cars health care total rights liberties due process juries you just don't get
[1:04:05.820 --> 1:04:09.580]  them the Russians had that too the communist Chinese do to they just don't
[1:04:09.580 --> 1:04:14.940]  follow it but in 29 it says unless any of these rights get in the way of the UN
[1:04:14.940 --> 1:04:20.460]  agenda paraphrase it and then you have none so I mean it's fine print folks it's
[1:04:20.460 --> 1:04:30.700]  like yeah you get this car no money down and no payments for six months but then
[1:04:30.700 --> 1:04:33.900]  you read the fine print except for 5,000 down but that's not counted as down
[1:04:33.900 --> 1:04:36.940]  that's a security deposit and well there is a payment but it's not called a
[1:04:36.940 --> 1:04:41.300]  payment yeah I mean it's all just games and then they sit here and just have this

[1:08:52.540 --> 1:08:58.540]  the hosts of the nightly news at seven going over just a disgusting comments
[1:08:58.540 --> 1:09:02.780]  Bill Maher that we discovered that have gotten no attention I made these
[1:09:02.780 --> 1:09:06.940]  comments publicly but it just goes the whole culture of death eugenics
[1:09:06.940 --> 1:09:10.820]  anti-human and what what establishment liberals really are they are not
[1:09:10.820 --> 1:09:15.540]  liberals they are very very monstrous people and then that doesn't mean
[1:09:15.540 --> 1:09:19.460]  establishment Republicans are good either but I mean the Democratic
[1:09:19.460 --> 1:09:23.300]  leadership the books they write the statements they make they are they are
[1:09:23.300 --> 1:09:29.460]  co-blooded and they are not the liberals they claim they are so that is coming up
[1:09:29.460 --> 1:09:34.700]  also the big news turkey is hell bent on provoking war in the Middle East all
[1:09:34.700 --> 1:09:39.500]  Joseph Watson breaks that down Jerusalem post Russia says turkey risk lives of
[1:09:39.500 --> 1:09:46.940]  passengers forcing down a Syrian aircraft from Russia bound for Syria a
[1:09:46.940 --> 1:09:50.900]  passenger plane with families on board it's being reported by the financial
[1:09:50.900 --> 1:09:54.460]  times you name it they came on board when they f-16s forced it down and beat
[1:09:54.460 --> 1:09:59.260]  people up on the plane including a Syrian citizens this was the families
[1:09:59.260 --> 1:10:04.220]  this is meant as a provocation they've already got Al Qaeda pouring in and
[1:10:04.220 --> 1:10:07.980]  shooting a few mortars back at Turkey to then blame on them false flags I mean
[1:10:07.980 --> 1:10:13.340]  this is just horrible and our troops under NATO are now fighting Russians
[1:10:13.340 --> 1:10:17.460]  that's in the news confirmed in a proxy war in Syria that's been started by the
[1:10:17.460 --> 1:10:23.660]  West and is in the West is allied with Al Qaeda on this I mean unresident and
[1:10:23.660 --> 1:10:27.340]  because you know in the Cold War they used them against the Serbs they used
[1:10:27.340 --> 1:10:29.860]  them against the Russians they used them again after the Cold War in the late
[1:10:29.860 --> 1:10:34.740]  90s as a pretext to have a NATO bomb Belgrade other areas of Serbia very
[1:10:34.740 --> 1:10:38.380]  immoral as well I'm not taking sides when the Muslims in the Serbs but it was
[1:10:38.380 --> 1:10:42.740]  the Al Qaeda groups in Kosovo attacking Serbs and doing it to the Serbs
[1:10:42.740 --> 1:10:48.900]  responded and it was a religious war kind of like the Crusades versus the
[1:10:48.900 --> 1:10:52.860]  different jihads that have gone on understanding history but but I mean
[1:10:52.860 --> 1:10:56.940]  now this is unprecedented because it's it totally starting it with our troops
[1:10:56.940 --> 1:11:01.220]  side-by-side with Al Qaeda and then you could say Taliban all day in the 80s
[1:11:01.220 --> 1:11:07.500]  this is Al Qaeda and it's on the news so just amazing Russia intervenes over
[1:11:07.500 --> 1:11:12.300]  Syrian airliner Russia is demanding an explanation from Turkey over its
[1:11:12.300 --> 1:11:18.820]  detention on Wednesday of the Syrian civilian airplane in route from Moscow
[1:11:18.820 --> 1:11:22.980]  to Damascus with Russian citizens on board Turkey said it's F-16 fighter jets
[1:11:22.980 --> 1:11:27.140]  had made the aircraft break its journey from Moscow to Damascus and land at the
[1:11:27.140 --> 1:11:31.860]  Anacar Airport on suspicion that it was transporting weapons from Russia to Assad
[1:11:31.860 --> 1:11:37.100]  regime well I mean the West is pouring weapons in Reuters reported on Thursday
[1:11:37.100 --> 1:11:40.180]  as the aircraft and its passengers had been allowed to continue their flight
[1:11:40.180 --> 1:11:44.620]  on parts of the cargo had been seized folks this has happened where Russian
[1:11:44.620 --> 1:11:48.700]  ships in the Atlantic coming down to get in the med are being grabbed by
[1:11:48.700 --> 1:11:55.300]  British warships and they haven't last time I checked found any ammo or missiles
[1:11:55.300 --> 1:12:00.660]  or anything but I mean that's their ally I mean again Russia is defending Syria
[1:12:00.660 --> 1:12:05.980]  from Al Qaeda attack and there are Russians there Russian generals been
[1:12:05.980 --> 1:12:10.340]  confirmed killed in the fighting I mean this is big I'm gonna say this again our
[1:12:10.340 --> 1:12:14.820]  government with NATO is allied with Al Qaeda in a proxy war with Russia right
[1:12:14.820 --> 1:12:19.260]  now and the rhetoric out of China is prepared for nuclear war I mean we've
[1:12:19.260 --> 1:12:23.020]  never heard that other presidents and top generals and and admirals I mean this
[1:12:23.020 --> 1:12:27.020]  is crazy right as the world markets meltdown this is when they start World
[1:12:27.020 --> 1:12:33.620]  Wars I mean I don't have words to describe how much danger we're all in
[1:12:33.620 --> 1:12:37.700]  and the fact that you can say the U.S. has done bad things in history but few
[1:12:37.700 --> 1:12:42.620]  times if we absolutely not had the moral high ground at any level this is
[1:12:42.620 --> 1:12:50.220]  shameful I am ashamed right now and I'm quite frankly freaked out because if
[1:12:50.220 --> 1:12:53.620]  they think the public so done that our government can run Al Qaeda while
[1:12:53.620 --> 1:12:57.660]  simultaneously saying we've got to attack Iran Hillary said last week they
[1:12:57.660 --> 1:13:04.140]  they're Al Qaeda I mean I mean it is it is cuckoo for cocoa puffs you know Woody
[1:13:04.140 --> 1:13:14.020]  Woodpecker I mean it is it is outrageously bad what is what is going
[1:13:14.020 --> 1:13:23.180]  on and I just don't even know what to say anymore it is above my pay grade and
[1:13:23.180 --> 1:13:29.300]  I mean by that I'm a smart guy I study geopolitical systems and it's just so
[1:13:29.300 --> 1:13:34.540]  wild that well I know why they're doing it I'll go to your phone calls it is
[1:13:34.540 --> 1:13:39.660]  total global chaos in their words not mine to bring in world government
[1:13:39.660 --> 1:13:43.780]  Herman von Roompi they've all said it the financial crisis the military crisis
[1:13:43.780 --> 1:13:49.700]  the flu crisis the collapse of Mexico the SPP documents said what six seven
[1:13:49.700 --> 1:13:53.140]  years ago it's in the end game blueprint for global enslavement they said we're
[1:13:53.140 --> 1:13:56.380]  going to use flu crises the collapse of Mexico that hadn't even happened yet
[1:13:56.380 --> 1:13:59.940]  we're going to use all these crises to bring in our world government and they
[1:13:59.940 --> 1:14:03.540]  said we've got to do it by stealth and judicial watch had to sue to get those
[1:14:03.540 --> 1:14:08.740]  documents this is the heads of major corporations with the heads of the US
[1:14:08.740 --> 1:14:12.260]  Canadian and Mexican government all they're telling the governments what to
[1:14:12.260 --> 1:14:17.980]  do in government councils I mean that's it the feds of federalized our police by
[1:14:17.980 --> 1:14:23.420]  and large the feds are federalizing the cities every town we go to around Austin
[1:14:23.420 --> 1:14:28.140]  we've sent reporters out got more reports coming up tomorrow it's a Jenna 21 and
[1:14:28.140 --> 1:14:30.860]  they've got the mayors they've got everybody they're they're funded by the
[1:14:30.860 --> 1:14:34.820]  Rockefeller Foundation they've got the city planners they're all there just
[1:14:34.820 --> 1:14:41.340]  taking everything over I mean it it's it's it's amazing to watch this
[1:14:41.340 --> 1:14:46.420]  happening all right let's go to your calls let's talk to Jake and Mississippi
[1:14:46.420 --> 1:14:51.900]  Jake thank you for holding her on the air hey Alex hey buddy hey man look I I
[1:14:51.900 --> 1:14:58.180]  got some questions about GMOs if a cattle farmer is using chicken litter
[1:14:58.180 --> 1:15:03.860]  chicken fertilizer to fertilize the hay seed and then cuts the hay or you know
[1:15:03.860 --> 1:15:09.020]  fertilizers the grass with it is is the grass and hay then contaminated with
[1:15:09.020 --> 1:15:17.540]  GMOs I would say to somewhat of an extent but the world according to a lot of
[1:15:17.540 --> 1:15:20.780]  the scientists and papers I read has such an amazing buffer that even if
[1:15:20.780 --> 1:15:26.620]  chickens themselves are being fed a bunch of GMO and pesticides in it and
[1:15:26.620 --> 1:15:31.300]  antibiotics and growth hormone the liver is so amazing that's why they have big
[1:15:31.300 --> 1:15:35.260]  swollen disease levers that it will hold most of it you definitely don't want to
[1:15:35.260 --> 1:15:40.780]  eat in GMO chicken livers or beef liver for that matter anything because that's
[1:15:40.780 --> 1:15:44.140]  kind of like if you've got dirty oil you don't want to you know drink out of the
[1:15:44.140 --> 1:15:48.860]  oil filter it's gonna be really dirty so I mean that's kind of a layman's way of
[1:15:48.860 --> 1:15:54.580]  putting it but again a little bit of GMOs bad but people have been shown to be
[1:15:54.580 --> 1:15:57.780]  able to handle it they they're trying to come out with every major food crop to
[1:15:57.780 --> 1:16:03.100]  be GMO already over 90% of the corn soybeans canola is GMO in this country
[1:16:03.100 --> 1:16:06.620]  and it's so it's in the fillers and it's hard to get around now they're coming
[1:16:06.620 --> 1:16:12.060]  out with hundreds and hundreds of major staple plants from cabbages to rutabaga
[1:16:12.060 --> 1:16:20.660]  to tomatoes to potatoes to just everything GMO and they're chem trailing
[1:16:20.660 --> 1:16:23.340]  the aluminum dioxide that makes it to where now they're coming out with GMO
[1:16:23.340 --> 1:16:30.060]  plants that can grow in aluminum soil I mean they've got a plan it is it is well
[1:16:30.060 --> 1:16:36.620]  we're living in a science fiction movie so I don't know what else I can say okay
[1:16:36.620 --> 1:16:40.900]  one other thing Alex did you know that they're building some of these drones
[1:16:40.900 --> 1:16:46.300]  down in Moss Point Mississippi on the Gulf Coast at Northbrook Grumman yes I
[1:16:46.300 --> 1:16:49.740]  did know Northrop Rums one of the but SCIC and others are some of the
[1:16:49.740 --> 1:16:54.100]  biggest filmmakers of the drones yeah well I just I just wanted to shoot that
[1:16:54.100 --> 1:16:57.380]  to you man in case you didn't know about it there's a lot of people around my
[1:16:57.380 --> 1:17:01.020]  negative woods that have no idea and they're astonished when they learn that
[1:17:01.020 --> 1:17:05.300]  fact well the issue is they've got eight thousand dollar drones that you can mount
[1:17:05.300 --> 1:17:11.540]  weapons on that that you and I can buy and you can program it to go out on a
[1:17:11.540 --> 1:17:15.660]  mission up to five miles and come back and do everything you want or you can
[1:17:15.660 --> 1:17:19.060]  program it on a basic mission and it's somewhat autonomous for eight thousand
[1:17:19.060 --> 1:17:24.740]  dollars now can you imagine what the Pentagon's got everything you see is is
[1:17:24.740 --> 1:17:29.020]  is is third or fourth generation drone I'm told they're up to like 10th 12th
[1:17:29.020 --> 1:17:33.260]  generation space planes you name it I mean that's why they're so airing it
[1:17:33.260 --> 1:17:36.740]  they've got bio weapons that are a hundred percent kill rates I mean it's
[1:17:36.740 --> 1:17:40.580]  it's just crazy it's like Atlantis I mean I don't know if Atlantis was real or
[1:17:40.580 --> 1:17:43.580]  not but you know there's been a lot of civilizations destroyed by volcanic
[1:17:43.580 --> 1:17:48.140]  activity meteorites things like that we don't know our real history and you know
[1:17:48.140 --> 1:17:52.660]  the globalist they again they say they want a world government to try to stop
[1:17:52.660 --> 1:17:56.020]  this out of control development but it's the opposite they're freezing our
[1:17:56.020 --> 1:18:00.460]  development while going hog wild in a race with each other to get live
[1:18:00.460 --> 1:18:03.820]  extension and I see a lot of arrogant statements out of them in their own
[1:18:03.820 --> 1:18:07.740]  policy reports not just Ray Kurzweil and others and they're really just crazy
[1:18:07.740 --> 1:18:11.220]  people I mean you know that like they were able to take over because they are
[1:18:11.220 --> 1:18:16.340]  so wild and are so daring but the same time they're very dangerous to
[1:18:16.340 --> 1:18:23.220]  themselves I just look I mean you know you've seen what elites have done in
[1:18:23.220 --> 1:18:27.940]  our history they always go crazy anything else no sir thank you very much
[1:18:27.940 --> 1:18:30.260]  thank you we're gonna go to break her in a minute and a half but let's go to
[1:18:30.260 --> 1:18:36.260]  another caller here let's talk to Kyle in Iowa you're on the air from Iowa
[1:18:36.260 --> 1:18:41.180]  hello Alex been a little while I called in I got two ideas that I kind of
[1:18:41.180 --> 1:18:46.140]  codified I just want to press or I just want to say this first I'm in sales
[1:18:46.140 --> 1:18:50.700]  currently and one important thing in sales is to when you're gonna give a
[1:18:50.700 --> 1:18:54.100]  pitch on something you got to give a quick concise pitch and not talk too
[1:18:54.100 --> 1:18:58.900]  much with the elections coming up and with a lot of people that understand the
[1:18:58.900 --> 1:19:02.820]  Fed but maybe don't have a good way to explain it I've got some for that and
[1:19:02.820 --> 1:19:06.540]  I've got an idea for you for something you could maybe sell like bumper stickers
[1:19:06.540 --> 1:19:10.220]  and t-shirts I'll start with the other idea first okay give us the bumper
[1:19:10.220 --> 1:19:14.260]  stickers and I'll hold you over with the big idea okay okay so with the bumper
[1:19:14.260 --> 1:19:18.380]  stickers you know how you had the 911 was inside job and you have the t-shirts
[1:19:18.380 --> 1:19:24.020]  that said that why not say the economic collapse is an inside job and get that
[1:19:24.020 --> 1:19:28.980]  out there pure pure genius pure genius we need a headline saying that I should
[1:19:28.980 --> 1:19:32.500]  tweet that fact I'm gonna tweet that right now at real Alex Jones people
[1:19:32.500 --> 1:19:36.260]  please retweet it the economic collapse is an inside job stay there I want to
[1:19:36.260 --> 1:19:40.860]  hear your ideas we should have whole shows about how to market liberty I mean
[1:19:40.860 --> 1:19:44.540]  that I mean the system that's like marketing period is evil no marketing
[1:19:44.540 --> 1:19:48.820]  that is deceptive or to sell people tyranny is bad I mean I believe the
[1:19:48.820 --> 1:19:53.060]  best marketing is just telling the truth truth sells and it creates a good
[1:19:53.060 --> 1:19:56.540]  world I just want to live in a good world I just want freedom I want to be

[1:20:11.620 --> 1:20:15.460]  sauerkraut yogurt and kefir it seems there's a war on life-giving foods with

[1:20:25.020 --> 1:20:28.300]  beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture even today

[1:24:24.100 --> 1:24:53.540]  all right speaking of calling is Kyle give us your other big idea
[1:24:53.540 --> 1:24:58.260]  yeah the financial collapse is an inside job great idea what was your point
[1:24:58.260 --> 1:25:05.980]  about exposing the private fellow reserve okay this is I kind of water
[1:25:05.980 --> 1:25:11.980]  blow this down into just a quick concise idea so that way people can get it
[1:25:11.980 --> 1:25:16.220]  because I've probably been awake since around 2007 and it took me a while to
[1:25:16.220 --> 1:25:19.940]  totally wrap my head around it and now it's just it's just it's really simple
[1:25:19.940 --> 1:25:23.420]  actually and this is how I break it down to people and like a lot of people are
[1:25:23.420 --> 1:25:28.180]  like oh okay even people are awake kind of like get that like look on their face
[1:25:28.180 --> 1:25:31.500]  like oh why didn't I think of that before but okay so this is how I explain
[1:25:31.500 --> 1:25:39.260]  it to people the Federal Reserve system is like a mandatory mastercard on the
[1:25:39.260 --> 1:25:45.340]  entire economy with no grace period whatsoever and no benefits your income
[1:25:45.340 --> 1:25:50.460]  tax is the minimum monthly payments and the only way you get paid is by taking
[1:25:50.460 --> 1:25:55.420]  out a cash advance all right what do people do with their debt they cut up
[1:25:55.420 --> 1:26:01.740]  the credit card and the story so I'm a little fired up right now now I hear you
[1:26:01.740 --> 1:26:06.980]  though I absolutely hear what you're saying my friend so but I think for the
[1:26:06.980 --> 1:26:10.700]  people that are awake take that and run with it because we don't have a whole lot
[1:26:10.700 --> 1:26:17.660]  of time left just get it done people we have to identify who's been engineering
[1:26:17.660 --> 1:26:21.300]  these problems because it's not gonna get better when the people that engineered
[1:26:21.300 --> 1:26:25.660]  it are in control and the private Federal Reserve is the enemy is the group
[1:26:25.660 --> 1:26:30.140]  percing on top this country let's talk to Julio in Illinois Julio you're on the
[1:26:30.140 --> 1:26:35.900]  year welcome yes hi Alex first off I'm an evil person right now I'm drinking a
[1:26:35.900 --> 1:26:41.820]  superfood organic superfood mixed with organic bananas organic 2% milk
[1:26:41.820 --> 1:26:46.820]  organic blueberries and I'm a sick person because I actually care about my
[1:26:46.820 --> 1:26:52.660]  health so let me take a sip really quick Alex I taste the freedom hello
[1:26:52.660 --> 1:26:57.860]  absolutely bro sounds like you're pretty evil go ahead I am evil um you know
[1:26:57.860 --> 1:27:02.900]  and you get a caller a caller or two callers before me talk about GMOs and
[1:27:02.900 --> 1:27:08.020]  I'm hopeful within the next few weeks to head out to a Midwestern state to
[1:27:08.020 --> 1:27:14.540]  expose a openly admitted weather modification project going on and it's
[1:27:14.540 --> 1:27:19.540]  astonishing we really need to focus on who these people are that are conducting
[1:27:19.540 --> 1:27:24.940]  weather modification who the people are controlling the money in terms of GMOs
[1:27:24.940 --> 1:27:29.100]  drought resistant seeds I've done research where they admit it's a 12
[1:27:29.100 --> 1:27:35.460]  million dollar seed market so companies like Pioneer, Cargill, Monsanto and so
[1:27:35.460 --> 1:27:41.820]  forth in the Midwest are going to make a ton of money and they are openly now in
[1:27:41.820 --> 1:27:45.620]  mainstream media and business articles throughout the country are admitting to
[1:27:45.620 --> 1:27:50.500]  drought resistant seeds as the solution to the recent drought but I have
[1:27:50.500 --> 1:27:54.060]  information where they're causing the drought because of weather modification
[1:27:54.060 --> 1:28:00.100]  and it's astonishing to see this take place it's astonishing that you have
[1:28:00.100 --> 1:28:05.180]  admissions that GMOs cause tumors and causes cancers and causes different
[1:28:05.180 --> 1:28:10.220]  diseases while at the same time you have these companies donating millions of
[1:28:10.220 --> 1:28:15.500]  dollars, Nestle, Pepsi, Coke and so forth are donating millions of dollars to block
[1:28:15.500 --> 1:28:20.220]  the labeling of you know if a product's GMO or not and it's really
[1:28:20.220 --> 1:28:26.260]  disturbing that a state is openly admitting to suppressing rain, suppressing
[1:28:26.260 --> 1:28:31.500]  storms, suppressing nature. Oh last time I checked there are over a hundred
[1:28:31.500 --> 1:28:35.860]  weather modification companies in the U.S. and Canada and I was having been
[1:28:35.860 --> 1:28:38.780]  Livingston on five six years ago the father of weather weapons he was very
[1:28:38.780 --> 1:28:44.260]  old then but still very sharp captain I guess Colonel later and he was the guy
[1:28:44.260 --> 1:28:47.140]  flying into Typhoons at the end of World War II the first kind of flying to
[1:28:47.140 --> 1:28:51.540]  Typhoons and Hurricanes and he was the guy leading squadrons in to create
[1:28:51.540 --> 1:28:55.420]  floods again the Ho Chi Minh Trail after that he classified it after we talked to
[1:28:55.420 --> 1:28:58.660]  him he was on TV and stuff but later he wouldn't come back on the show because
[1:28:58.660 --> 1:29:03.260]  of I'm not gonna get into it phone calls and stuff they got but he was the head
[1:29:03.260 --> 1:29:06.980]  meteorologist at a big company that's doing weather modification and it's one
[1:29:06.980 --> 1:29:10.060]  thing if there's a total drought you know and you lease aircraft to go up and
[1:29:10.060 --> 1:29:14.100]  spray and make it rain on your area but the issue is there's government funded
[1:29:14.100 --> 1:29:17.420]  groups and contractors that are obviously doing things that we've had
[1:29:17.420 --> 1:29:22.260]  weathermen and women meteorologist on that is designed I've got clips of people
[1:29:22.260 --> 1:29:25.700]  on the news saying whatever they're doing is blocking the water and they send
[1:29:25.700 --> 1:29:31.140]  up aircraft to to knock out storms to knock out water and then there's even
[1:29:31.140 --> 1:29:35.420]  treaties on weather weapons I mean this is going on over in Dubai they're making
[1:29:35.420 --> 1:29:38.720]  the desert green with it the Chinese use it but then our media is like no it
[1:29:38.720 --> 1:29:42.060]  doesn't exist even when the White House scientists are in his first speech
[1:29:42.060 --> 1:29:46.740]  admitted that that it's going on so it's incredible all right we'll be right
[1:29:46.740 --> 1:29:50.540]  back folks stay with us straight ahead with a special report we're on the
[1:29:50.540 --> 1:30:00.900]  March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network the worst
[1:30:00.900 --> 1:30:04.740]  drought in 50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the
[1:30:04.740 --> 1:30:08.900]  hottest half year on record 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought
[1:30:08.900 --> 1:30:13.180]  conditions not only corn but soy alfalfa fruits vegetables and wheat are all
[1:30:13.180 --> 1:30:17.780]  impacted raising prices the cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers
[1:30:17.780 --> 1:30:21.540]  out of business blowing up your food prices the only strategy to counter this
[1:30:21.540 --> 1:30:25.660]  is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of
[1:30:25.660 --> 1:30:30.140]  foods from e-foods direct now as the price of raw ingredients increases e-foods
[1:30:30.140 --> 1:30:33.660]  will have to raise prices too now is the time to get your supply I recently

[1:33:44.540 --> 1:33:51.780]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com the article is up there right now you need
[1:33:51.780 --> 1:33:56.700]  to hit refresh because it just went up literally two minutes ago Bill Maher we
[1:33:56.700 --> 1:34:02.980]  need to promote death is the headline that's a quote the planet is too crowded
[1:34:02.980 --> 1:34:09.220]  let's kill the right people and this is Bill Maherm
[1:34:09.220 --> 1:34:14.620]  during a recent appearance on the StarTalk radio show real-time host Bill Maher expressed his
[1:34:14.620 --> 1:34:18.540]  desire to see more people killed via abortion suicides and death penalty
[1:34:18.540 --> 1:34:23.060]  because the planet is too crowded and we need to promote death this is a host of
[1:34:23.060 --> 1:34:28.180]  HBO television show as you know and who's always there lecturing us about
[1:34:28.180 --> 1:34:32.180]  how he's high and mighty we have a clip of that in a moment asked by the host
[1:34:32.180 --> 1:34:37.180]  Neil de Gracie Tyson what he thought about the death penalty and abortion Maher
[1:34:37.180 --> 1:34:41.100]  reaffirmed a support of both remarking the Pope is consistently pro-life I'm
[1:34:41.100 --> 1:34:44.500]  consistently pro-death expressing how he was pro-death penalty Bill Maher said
[1:34:44.500 --> 1:34:48.780]  my motto is let's kill the right people I'm pro-choice I'm for assisted
[1:34:48.780 --> 1:34:53.580]  suicide I'm for regular suicide I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving that's
[1:34:53.580 --> 1:34:56.980]  when I'm for well you have a freeway because of a large populations able to
[1:34:56.980 --> 1:35:01.060]  build that idiot said Maher adding it's too crowded the planet's too crowded and
[1:35:01.060 --> 1:35:06.340]  we need to promote death now you saw the big a bioethics publication come out
[1:35:06.340 --> 1:35:11.380]  six months ago and Paul Watson found it and made it a big national news story
[1:35:11.380 --> 1:35:15.500]  drudgereport.com others link to it thank God and it got out and at first the
[1:35:15.500 --> 1:35:19.460]  media said this must not be true and the commenters couldn't believe it they
[1:35:19.460 --> 1:35:23.300]  went and read it's like wow it is true it's not just Peter Singer at Princeton
[1:35:23.300 --> 1:35:28.380]  it's the main bioethics grips listen Dr. Pionka UT in the biology department
[1:35:28.380 --> 1:35:32.740]  five years ago six years ago it's an in-game my film he said well I can't
[1:35:32.740 --> 1:35:35.980]  wait for airborne a ball to be released it's gonna kill 90% me and my family
[1:35:35.980 --> 1:35:39.580]  ready to die you know it's a good thing FBI even went and visited him after I
[1:35:39.580 --> 1:35:42.700]  covered it he went to the Texas Academy of Sciences he's got an awards in Europe
[1:35:42.700 --> 1:35:46.380]  too and there was a three-minute standing ovation I had the reporters on
[1:35:46.380 --> 1:35:52.420]  with crying by Texas scientists the top scientist when he projected a huge wall
[1:35:52.420 --> 1:35:59.820]  of red skulls saying you know mass death is coming this is a death cult and it
[1:35:59.820 --> 1:36:05.140]  sounds crazy because they are crazy see I'm not crazy for covering them I found
[1:36:05.140 --> 1:36:08.900]  crazy covering them I get that I mean if I gave you Roman history of Caligula
[1:36:08.900 --> 1:36:13.780]  and Nero or am I I read Aztec rituals on air you that's a crazy show no Aztec
[1:36:13.780 --> 1:36:18.820]  rituals are crazy as we print me an encyclopedia list of Aztec rituals so
[1:36:18.820 --> 1:36:22.980]  they'll hear themselves you know sexual mutilation taking a big cord to your
[1:36:22.980 --> 1:36:28.100]  tongue with with with obsidian glass and slicing your tongue open chopping your
[1:36:28.100 --> 1:36:34.380]  children's hearts out eating them I mean that that that's crazy I'm not for that
[1:36:34.380 --> 1:36:39.860]  I'm against it and these guys are into death and this happens in a decadent
[1:36:39.860 --> 1:36:44.380]  cycle Camille Paglia has written about it many others have written about it it's
[1:36:44.380 --> 1:36:50.700]  happens throughout history we're entering a very very decadent phase right
[1:36:50.700 --> 1:36:57.820]  now and we're in trouble okay because every culture gets these crazies in
[1:36:57.820 --> 1:37:02.020]  charge and for someone that's that's that's nothing but materialistic and
[1:37:02.020 --> 1:37:05.140]  decadent they start hating everyone because they really hate themselves
[1:37:05.140 --> 1:37:10.100]  they're projecting it to simplify it and they want death and this article is
[1:37:10.100 --> 1:37:13.300]  very important to get out to people and I'm gonna have Watson who's just doing a
[1:37:13.300 --> 1:37:17.900]  great job add you add some context Paul I know you rushed this out where you know
[1:37:17.900 --> 1:37:21.740]  your article about hey let's kill the babies up to age three they're now
[1:37:21.740 --> 1:37:25.540]  saying let's kill the old people see first it's old die with dignity then
[1:37:25.540 --> 1:37:29.060]  it's we're going to kill you oh and oh yeah there is death panels you know you
[1:37:29.060 --> 1:37:32.820]  don't need that surgery you know you're old you don't need you know new retinas
[1:37:32.820 --> 1:37:37.700]  you don't need new lenses you don't need a new knee see when you lower quality
[1:37:37.700 --> 1:37:43.820]  and then say society has a set some civilization collapses when you demand
[1:37:43.820 --> 1:37:47.540]  quality demand somebody pick up your trash at McDonald's now there's more
[1:37:47.540 --> 1:37:51.540]  jobs now there's more quality now they've got to compete it's like a reef system
[1:37:51.540 --> 1:37:56.220]  where where the more industry the more business the more ideas the better
[1:37:56.220 --> 1:38:01.100]  there are jobs the globalist cells shutting things down and taking from
[1:38:01.100 --> 1:38:05.260]  somebody will give you a job raising taxes will give you a more welfare no
[1:38:05.260 --> 1:38:09.420]  it will reduce the tax base but they know this they want to make you poor this
[1:38:09.420 --> 1:38:15.340]  is a death culture and there's hundreds of examples of this I mean I could play
[1:38:15.340 --> 1:38:18.900]  Fox News clips saying too many kids is what's making the planet worse really
[1:38:18.900 --> 1:38:22.700]  the actuaries are about eight and a half billion people by 2025 and then it
[1:38:22.700 --> 1:38:27.020]  drops dramatically down about three billion if the trend follows the
[1:38:27.020 --> 1:38:32.620]  computer models by what is it 20 30 or so you can pull these numbers up they
[1:38:32.620 --> 1:38:40.540]  vary 21 30 excuse me not 20 30 21 30 so that's the type of stuff we've got
[1:38:40.540 --> 1:38:44.660]  going on here and I've gone over the actuaries I've played some of the
[1:38:44.660 --> 1:38:49.500]  educational actuaries here on air that shows the numbers that poll why don't you
[1:38:49.500 --> 1:38:53.100]  add that to your article that population study group you know that has all the
[1:38:53.100 --> 1:38:56.620]  little black-and-white graphics showing the actual numbers of where Europe's
[1:38:56.620 --> 1:39:03.140]  1.3 replacement rate some countries even 1.2 Japan's 1.2 1.3 depending on
[1:39:03.140 --> 1:39:07.580]  which year you look at the US is 1.5 but we have a huge immigrant influx so the
[1:39:07.580 --> 1:39:14.860]  population grows slowly it's now at 312 million so the world 7 billion 100
[1:39:14.860 --> 1:39:17.660]  million or so and it's gonna hit about eight and a half billion and then start
[1:39:17.660 --> 1:39:21.860]  going down you need to now keep it at that level at least or there won't be
[1:39:21.860 --> 1:39:26.580]  two people to take care of two people there won't be two people to pay taxes
[1:39:26.580 --> 1:39:29.940]  for the two people that are retired see so they get you in a nanny state they
[1:39:29.940 --> 1:39:32.940]  get you dependent then they start cutting the resources off and then you
[1:39:32.940 --> 1:39:35.940]  fight even more for big government thinking bigger government will give you
[1:39:35.940 --> 1:39:40.980]  the resources see that's the trap but you don't have to be a dumb animal you
[1:39:40.980 --> 1:39:44.620]  could take control of these manipulations and be conscious of it and
[1:39:44.620 --> 1:39:47.620]  then get into a war game level like the globalist are and then see their whole
[1:39:47.620 --> 1:39:52.700]  plan and let me tell you when you see it you know how crazy it is so this is a
[1:39:52.700 --> 1:39:56.740]  very important story let's play the clip and go to Paul Watson he's joining us on
[1:39:56.740 --> 1:40:01.420]  Skype here is Bill Marr on StarTalk radio show and this has gotten no
[1:40:01.420 --> 1:40:05.340]  attention Paul discovered this it's breaking now I think this is a big
[1:40:05.340 --> 1:40:09.340]  national story because it just shows these are not liberals like Margaret
[1:40:09.340 --> 1:40:12.220]  Sanger said in her letters she said to foundations to get money from Rockefeller
[1:40:12.220 --> 1:40:16.260]  she said we got to kill the blackweeds to do we got to pose as liberals we got to
[1:40:16.260 --> 1:40:22.060]  hire blacks we got to get abortion going and she's held as a liberal and even
[1:40:22.060 --> 1:40:26.820]  though Hitler worshipped the woman and she worshipped him on record again they
[1:40:26.820 --> 1:40:32.140]  call dr. Watson you know then they discovered DNA a big liberal I mean he
[1:40:32.140 --> 1:40:36.820]  gets double prizes and he says blacks aren't humans and that and neither are
[1:40:36.820 --> 1:40:40.940]  you by the way only he the super races you know these people are dangerous
[1:40:40.940 --> 1:40:44.940]  folks and they're not liberals that's their camouflage they're dangerous
[1:40:44.940 --> 1:40:49.140]  here's Bill Marr very sick you support the death penalty according to my note
[1:40:49.140 --> 1:40:53.460]  isn't it largely Republican I don't yeah my not of birth the idea but I mean I
[1:40:53.460 --> 1:40:57.420]  have a lot of ideas that you might consider conservative but I feel like
[1:40:57.420 --> 1:41:01.260]  on that I'm just consistent like the Pope is considered the Pope is
[1:41:01.260 --> 1:41:08.500]  consistently pro-life I'm consistently pro-death I'm death penalty although I do
[1:41:08.500 --> 1:41:14.420]  believe in more DNA testing I build my motto is let's kill the right people I'm
[1:41:14.420 --> 1:41:19.860]  pro-choice I'm for assisted suicide I'm for regular so I'm for whatever gets the
[1:41:19.860 --> 1:41:23.940]  freeway moving that's what I'm for all right way way too crowded so the planet
[1:41:23.940 --> 1:41:27.980]  is too crowded and we need to promote that when I look at the Venn diagram of
[1:41:27.980 --> 1:41:34.020]  people who are pro-death penalty and pro-choice I don't think they intersect
[1:41:34.020 --> 1:41:37.780]  you may be the lone person in the world at that intersection absolutely not I
[1:41:37.780 --> 1:41:42.380]  met plenty of people who have the same feelings pro-choice and yeah I mean
[1:41:42.380 --> 1:41:45.660]  well pro I mean you know I'm not randomly going around the street saying
[1:41:45.660 --> 1:41:49.060]  hey we're gonna kill you I mean we're talking about people who've earned it
[1:41:49.060 --> 1:41:54.180]  but as I say you know kill the right I kill the right people but I'm just not
[1:41:54.180 --> 1:41:58.220]  one of those people who thinks all life is precious you know I bet you a lot of
[1:41:58.220 --> 1:42:02.100]  people wouldn't say that but if you're pro-choice maybe that's really what
[1:42:02.100 --> 1:42:05.580]  you're thinking anyway I mean this is the big controversy that Rick Santorum
[1:42:05.580 --> 1:42:10.900]  brought up he does not like prenatal testing because he says that leads to
[1:42:10.900 --> 1:42:15.860]  abortion because people find out that they're gonna have a child who is not
[1:42:15.860 --> 1:42:19.700]  normal in some way and they have an abortion because they don't want to
[1:42:19.700 --> 1:42:23.660]  raise a child with severe challenges I don't think there's anything wrong with
[1:42:23.660 --> 1:42:27.700]  that I'm not bring someone in the world whose life is gonna be and it goes on
[1:42:27.700 --> 1:42:31.660]  on the videos up at info wars dot-com and prison water dot-com and Paul
[1:42:31.660 --> 1:42:36.100]  Watson's report his skype's having problems but he's about to join us here
[1:42:36.100 --> 1:42:40.180]  in a moment this is eugenics because then it's like well you might have a
[1:42:40.180 --> 1:42:43.860]  predisposition for cancer or a predisposition for aggression to
[1:42:43.860 --> 1:42:46.660]  authority that they call mental illness which they're now saying see once
[1:42:46.660 --> 1:42:49.380]  they pretty much sterilizes you've got to go in and then have the designer baby
[1:42:49.380 --> 1:42:52.500]  because they can now create the artificial leg but then they design and
[1:42:52.500 --> 1:42:57.540]  just like they add backdoor stuff into your cell phone to track you and just
[1:42:57.540 --> 1:43:00.940]  like DARPA created the internet the system admits they're going to now the
[1:43:00.940 --> 1:43:03.700]  designer humans they're going to decide and that's what they're saying they're
[1:43:03.700 --> 1:43:07.300]  saying if a child has any health problems or even doesn't if you just want to
[1:43:07.300 --> 1:43:12.940]  kill your kid up to age 3 kill them and that's in prestigious bioethics reports
[1:43:12.940 --> 1:43:16.660]  you saw that national news the London Telegraph picked it up Daily Mail picked
[1:43:16.660 --> 1:43:20.220]  it up Associated Press picked it up after we reported it and you know some of
[1:43:20.220 --> 1:43:24.620]  the US news was like well yeah I mean kill gets up to 3 because humans are
[1:43:24.620 --> 1:43:27.940]  trash I mean the TSA takes your daughter and grabs her I mean they rip the
[1:43:27.940 --> 1:43:31.740]  colostomy bag off an old lady they make an old lady you know take take bandages
[1:43:31.740 --> 1:43:35.380]  off from her surgery I mean it's about we're trash yeah somebody died of a
[1:43:35.380 --> 1:43:39.580]  taser the other day yeah you know big deal yeah okay the cancer rates up there's
[1:43:39.580 --> 1:43:43.820]  too many people and we have all these bioscientists genetic engineers who
[1:43:43.820 --> 1:43:47.900]  von record said well okay it's yeah GMO is sterilizing you what do you think we
[1:43:47.900 --> 1:43:51.580]  designed it for you think we just put one trait in there so it would grow
[1:43:51.580 --> 1:43:56.060]  quicker we put other stuff in there I mean they can make crops grow HIV if they
[1:43:56.060 --> 1:43:59.700]  want they can make crops grow chemicals it's called pharmacological crops and
[1:43:59.700 --> 1:44:04.780]  they're designing them and you're eating a chemical bio weapon and it's funny to
[1:44:04.780 --> 1:44:07.980]  them I mean it's the power trip and and I've been around these globalists they
[1:44:07.980 --> 1:44:12.180]  sit there arrogant and snake like real cold-blooded and they think you don't
[1:44:12.180 --> 1:44:16.820]  know they think you're an animal and and and your life means nothing let me
[1:44:16.820 --> 1:44:20.740]  tell you something I'm not an animal and you're an animal you're a dirty filthy
[1:44:20.740 --> 1:44:24.940]  animal Bill Maher you're not a human being the type of stuff you're pushing
[1:44:24.940 --> 1:44:28.580]  is what Hitler did and it's what the Soviets who were you Genesis did and
[1:44:28.580 --> 1:44:31.580]  it's what Mao did and it's what murders hundreds of millions of people and
[1:44:31.580 --> 1:44:37.460]  ruins civilizations hey I want to be out on the freeway I want less people well
[1:44:37.460 --> 1:44:42.340]  you know what how about then you kill yourself Bill Maher and I'm not saying
[1:44:42.340 --> 1:44:45.020]  Bill Maher should actually kill himself but if he's saying little babies need to
[1:44:45.020 --> 1:44:47.900]  die and he's saying he wants to kill people because there's people on the
[1:44:47.900 --> 1:44:53.780]  highway Bill Maher you kill yourself okay before you call for dead children
[1:44:53.780 --> 1:44:59.620]  before you call for all this crud you kill yourself Bill Maher Bill Maher you're
[1:44:59.620 --> 1:45:03.980]  a danger to humanity you're a threat to humanity you hear that everybody Bill
[1:45:03.980 --> 1:45:08.500]  Maher is a threat to humanity and what he's surfacing there is what his cults
[1:45:08.500 --> 1:45:12.220]  all about okay and they're all over the place shooting their mouths off I can
[1:45:12.220 --> 1:45:14.740]  tell you how many times I've been talking to an abortionist or one of their
[1:45:14.740 --> 1:45:18.340]  supporters and they'll look over and go we're gonna get rid of these blacks and
[1:45:18.340 --> 1:45:24.460]  there's nothing you're gonna do you know I've played those clips on air but the
[1:45:24.460 --> 1:45:27.420]  truth is they just pick a group they think people want to kill the truth is
[1:45:27.420 --> 1:45:33.380]  they just want to kill they just want to kill ladies and gentlemen that's what
[1:45:33.380 --> 1:45:35.940]  they're into they're into death well you know what I'm not into death I'm into
[1:45:35.940 --> 1:45:40.820]  life but but what's sick is they they put people on welfare to make them the
[1:45:40.820 --> 1:45:44.220]  blobs they say they are to get them dependent so they can then sell the
[1:45:44.220 --> 1:45:47.580]  idea of killing them it's sick the truth is they want to dominate everybody
[1:45:47.580 --> 1:45:51.820]  down everybody down so they can control the future destiny of humanity this is
[1:45:51.820 --> 1:45:56.580]  the ultimate act of selfishness tear down humanity instead of building it up
[1:45:56.580 --> 1:46:04.380]  disgusting Bill Maher disgusting disgusting and I think God's gonna judge
[1:46:04.380 --> 1:46:08.460]  Bill Maher for his insolence and his arrogance it's one thing to do evil but
[1:46:08.460 --> 1:46:12.020]  I found if you brag about it studied history I studied the way things work
[1:46:12.020 --> 1:46:15.540]  it's like saying not even God can sink the Titanic and it sinks on its maiden
[1:46:15.540 --> 1:46:21.540]  voyage Bill Maher I'm not cursing you because only God does that but I well
[1:46:21.540 --> 1:46:24.540]  you're cursed to hell there's no doubt about that you'd love evil you love
[1:46:24.540 --> 1:46:28.620]  hurting the little ones but let me tell you something pal you tell you something
[1:46:28.620 --> 1:46:34.100]  pal I wouldn't want to be you when you meet your maker and I know people that
[1:46:34.100 --> 1:46:36.700]  have had dinner with you privately and tell me about the stuff you say I know
[1:46:36.700 --> 1:46:42.540]  you hate God you hate God it's not that you don't believe in God you hate God
[1:46:42.540 --> 1:46:46.820]  because you've turned your heart to evil instead of turning your heart towards
[1:46:46.820 --> 1:46:54.300]  what's good let's go ahead and talk to Paul Watson Paul this report you found
[1:46:54.300 --> 1:46:57.340]  it a listener I guess sent you a tip there's no news on this this is a big
[1:46:57.340 --> 1:47:02.020]  deal to say we need to promote a culture of death Paul Watson well yeah it's
[1:47:02.020 --> 1:47:06.260]  interesting Alex that you mentioned before that this is a new cult because
[1:47:06.260 --> 1:47:11.220]  most people think the Manson family cult ended about 34 years ago they
[1:47:11.220 --> 1:47:15.820]  actually didn't because Charlie Manson who of course masterminded all those
[1:47:15.820 --> 1:47:20.340]  murders his followers carried them out he morphed into a kind of new age guru
[1:47:20.340 --> 1:47:26.060]  who proselytized about global warming and overpopulation and he attracted a
[1:47:26.060 --> 1:47:32.180]  whole new cult of followers based on that meme and so I guess Bill Maher is one
[1:47:32.180 --> 1:47:38.220]  of them because the context of this discussion on the the start hook radio
[1:47:38.220 --> 1:47:43.500]  show with as you said Neil deGrasse Tyson who is a humanist and astrophysicist
[1:47:43.500 --> 1:47:49.740]  was global warming it was overpopulation and then it ended up with Bill Maher
[1:47:49.740 --> 1:47:53.100]  basically admitting that he wants to promote death he wants to promote
[1:47:53.100 --> 1:47:57.220]  suicide abortion the death penalty simply because it's going to get rid of
[1:47:57.220 --> 1:48:01.100]  more people and make his life more convenient but as he as he mentioned
[1:48:01.100 --> 1:48:05.460]  before with the UN population figures the people who make this argument about
[1:48:05.460 --> 1:48:11.580]  overpopulation do it completely out of their own egotistic convenience
[1:48:11.580 --> 1:48:18.180]  because the actual figures show that by 2020 the population replacement rate of
[1:48:18.180 --> 1:48:24.540]  2.1 is going to level off and by the 2050 we're going to have a massive
[1:48:24.540 --> 1:48:30.340]  depopulation crisis which is why countries like Russia in a mad scramble
[1:48:30.340 --> 1:48:34.140]  trying to encourage their population to have children because it's going to be
[1:48:34.140 --> 1:48:38.540]  a demographic crisis coming up in the next couple of decades and even in
[1:48:38.540 --> 1:48:43.820]  places like Brazil Indonesia and India their fertility rates are rapidly
[1:48:43.820 --> 1:48:48.660]  declining we all know why and now people in those countries which obviously you
[1:48:48.660 --> 1:48:53.100]  would expect that overpopulation would be the concern now there's concern in
[1:48:53.100 --> 1:48:57.620]  even those countries that the drop in fertility is going to cause a depopulation
[1:48:57.620 --> 1:49:02.340]  crisis and that's the UN that's not me saying that as the UN population
[1:49:02.340 --> 1:49:06.740]  division's own figures saying it's what the White House science are called for
[1:49:06.740 --> 1:49:09.780]  in eco science they're adding stuff to food and water and we've got this
[1:49:09.780 --> 1:49:15.500]  countless bio scientists, genetic engineers and ethicists going yeah we
[1:49:15.500 --> 1:49:19.020]  need this yeah we're sterilizing you and the thing is it's happening to the
[1:49:19.020 --> 1:49:22.380]  yuppies too that think it's a great idea when the West is going to be
[1:49:22.380 --> 1:49:27.620]  completely gone I mean the West is dying. Exactly that's why everybody's saying
[1:49:27.620 --> 1:49:31.740]  you've got to have kids they're giving people benefits to have kids in Russia
[1:49:31.740 --> 1:49:36.620]  and then on the flip side you've got people like Bill Gates saying that he's
[1:49:36.620 --> 1:49:42.980]  gonna use vaccines to reduce population and then the crowd at Ted TV goes when
[1:49:42.980 --> 1:49:46.580]  he shows the graph of bringing humans down to zero because it's all so cold
[1:49:46.580 --> 1:49:50.620]  blooded hidden in plain view just like the guys on C-SPAN saying let's stage
[1:49:50.620 --> 1:49:54.900]  false flags I mean they just they operate like we're like we're zombies and
[1:49:54.900 --> 1:49:59.740]  don't hear them. Well they know that most people are sitting there watching
[1:49:59.740 --> 1:50:03.020]  sitcoms for six hours a night and they're not really paying attention so they
[1:50:03.020 --> 1:50:07.980]  think they can get away with it but yeah I mean Bill Gates obviously again
[1:50:07.980 --> 1:50:11.460]  saying yeah we're gonna have death panels and we're gonna restrict end of
[1:50:11.460 --> 1:50:16.340]  life care for the elderly because that money can be better spent so both in
[1:50:16.340 --> 1:50:20.660]  terms of vaccines and restricting end of life care he's saying let's just kill
[1:50:20.660 --> 1:50:25.060]  people and that's precisely the rhetoric being echoed by Bill Maher in this
[1:50:25.060 --> 1:50:30.340]  clip. Amazing absolutely amazing we're going to break here in a moment Paul
[1:50:30.340 --> 1:50:33.700]  other points you're gonna add when we come back in a final segment with you
[1:50:33.700 --> 1:50:38.900]  ahead of more calls. Well just to fight the whole population reduction scam is
[1:50:38.900 --> 1:50:42.780]  exactly that it's a complete myth people don't bought into it for their own
[1:50:42.780 --> 1:50:47.580]  selfish reasons and it's simply not true. Well yeah and at its heart it's the
[1:50:47.580 --> 1:50:52.980]  ultimate form of selfishness and trendy classism to just I mean I've sat there
[1:50:52.980 --> 1:50:56.820]  and watched environmentalists at national parks look at everyone and go
[1:50:56.820 --> 1:51:01.740]  people shouldn't even be allowed here it's just a power trip. The worst drought in
[1:51:01.740 --> 1:51:05.660]  50 years continues and the first six months of 2012 marks the hottest half
[1:51:05.660 --> 1:51:10.460]  year on record. 78% of the Midwest corn belt is in drought conditions not only
[1:51:10.460 --> 1:51:14.660]  corn but soy, alfalfa, fruits, vegetables and wheat are all impacted raising
[1:51:14.660 --> 1:51:18.460]  prices. The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of
[1:51:18.460 --> 1:51:22.500]  business blowing up your food prices. The only strategy to counter this is to
[1:51:22.500 --> 1:51:26.700]  freeze your food cost to today's prices by getting your own supply of foods or
[1:51:26.700 --> 1:51:30.900]  me foods direct now. As the price of raw ingredients increases, e-foods will have
[1:51:30.900 --> 1:51:34.740]  to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply. I recently increased my

[1:54:21.020 --> 1:54:26.500]  Yeah, no more Mr. Knife Guy with people like Bill Maher. I mean, these lovers of
[1:54:26.500 --> 1:54:31.420]  death who are promoting the police state, but collectivism and the way of
[1:54:31.420 --> 1:54:34.620]  helping people, they always want you to have healthcare government run because
[1:54:34.620 --> 1:54:37.620]  they care about you. You know what they want is the government run of your
[1:54:37.620 --> 1:54:40.940]  health care so they can euthanize your butt. They've gotten rid of the
[1:54:40.940 --> 1:54:45.980]  Hippocratic Oath. Government-run healthcare means eugenics healthcare. And
[1:54:45.980 --> 1:54:50.780]  everything you heard out of Maher's mouth is a Malthusian statement. You
[1:54:50.780 --> 1:54:55.300]  know, there's a reason we don't want to abort children that have Down syndrome
[1:54:55.300 --> 1:55:00.940]  because we know that's how it started in Nazi Germany. Then it's going to be a
[1:55:00.940 --> 1:55:09.140]  child who's got a deformed foot. And it's going to be, I mean, I can't tell you
[1:55:09.140 --> 1:55:12.580]  how many people with handicaps, how many people with problems end up being
[1:55:12.580 --> 1:55:17.380]  hyper-intelligent in other ways and delivering such amazing gifts to humanity.
[1:55:17.380 --> 1:55:21.260]  And what you do to the least of these, you've done to me. And if you don't
[1:55:21.260 --> 1:55:24.860]  believe the Bible, folks, look, when you have this barbarous attitude,
[1:55:24.860 --> 1:55:30.100]  civilization collapses. And I'm sick of all of the liberals showing their
[1:55:30.100 --> 1:55:33.260]  liberal when I've been around them. They're not liberals, folks. They are sick,
[1:55:33.260 --> 1:55:41.260]  twisted, hateful, demonic trash. Oh, they make me sick. They are, and the fact
[1:55:41.260 --> 1:55:44.820]  that they're so camouflaged and they're just, they're demons is what they are.
[1:55:44.820 --> 1:55:48.580]  They think they, there's no God, but when you really get into it, they're always
[1:55:48.580 --> 1:55:51.940]  into the occult, and they really are occultists. Well, they're Satanists is
[1:55:51.940 --> 1:55:55.980]  what they are. Bill Maher is a pig-like Satanist. Even if he doesn't consciously
[1:55:55.980 --> 1:56:01.660]  say that, Bill Maher is everything for me. I want everybody dead, so the highway's
[1:56:01.660 --> 1:56:07.380]  wide open for me, because I'm a pig. I'm ranting, Paul. Make your point. Well, you
[1:56:07.380 --> 1:56:10.580]  had, I know we've had the clips. I forget the name of the big population study
[1:56:10.580 --> 1:56:13.780]  grip that has the black and white YouTube videos with accurate numbers
[1:56:13.780 --> 1:56:17.820]  showing how society's gonna collapse. We don't at least have two children. Well,
[1:56:17.820 --> 1:56:21.260]  it's 2.2 for every two adults. She's a little extra for those that die in wrecks
[1:56:21.260 --> 1:56:24.500]  and things. But you add into the population collapse that's happening in
[1:56:24.500 --> 1:56:28.540]  the Western world. I mean, we're entering a road warrior scenario here. All of the
[1:56:28.540 --> 1:56:32.340]  demographers say. But meanwhile, we have demographers in articles saying world
[1:56:32.340 --> 1:56:36.060]  government cut off the food, sterilize the people. That was in the news yesterday.
[1:56:36.060 --> 1:56:41.860]  I mean, it's so crazy, Paul. Well, yeah, it was a UN blueprint from two years ago.
[1:56:41.860 --> 1:56:45.620]  They said, look, global warming is being discredited. We need to replace it with
[1:56:45.620 --> 1:56:50.740]  this overpopulation. So that's exactly what they've done. And it's neo eugenics,
[1:56:50.740 --> 1:56:55.620]  isn't it? Because you mentioned a minute ago about Nazis. Well, of course, the Nazis
[1:56:55.620 --> 1:57:00.460]  got it from the British and you can pick up this numerous different strands. But
[1:57:00.460 --> 1:57:04.420]  one I find interesting is here in Britain, they have all these magazine
[1:57:04.420 --> 1:57:09.900]  articles encouraging women in their 20s to get sterilized before their 30s. And
[1:57:09.900 --> 1:57:14.180]  it's so sexy. You've done articles. It's so cool to get sterilized. Don't just get
[1:57:14.180 --> 1:57:18.100]  your tubes tied. Go all the way, cut the ovaries out, really show us you're a
[1:57:18.100 --> 1:57:24.420]  feminist. Yeah, yeah, cut out the jewel of creation. Yeah, exactly. And it's all
[1:57:24.420 --> 1:57:29.620]  being run by Marie Stopes International. And who was Marie Stopes? Well, she was a
[1:57:29.620 --> 1:57:37.220]  feminist in the 1920s, 1930s, who wrote love letters to Adolf Hitler, advocating
[1:57:37.220 --> 1:57:43.300]  that the poor of character, drunkards and disease people be sterilized. And she
[1:57:43.300 --> 1:57:50.900]  actually attended the Nazi Congress on population in Berlin in 1935. So she's
[1:57:50.900 --> 1:57:55.580]  this big feminist icon hero in Britain, they put her on the stamps, their
[1:57:55.580 --> 1:58:01.540]  organization offers sterilization for women. And she in fact went on to leave
[1:58:01.540 --> 1:58:05.740]  most of her estate to the eugenics society, which later became the Galton
[1:58:05.740 --> 1:58:11.740]  Institute. And the Galton Institute today is involved in family planning
[1:58:11.740 --> 1:58:17.100]  facilities in the third world. So we all know what that means. So you can trace it
[1:58:17.100 --> 1:58:21.220]  right back to the Nazis. You can trace it back. And let's get one thing clear for
[1:58:21.220 --> 1:58:25.020]  even the racist or people out there. Even if you want to kill brown people and
[1:58:25.020 --> 1:58:28.660]  you think, you know, get rid of them or whatever, they're killing you moron. The
[1:58:28.660 --> 1:58:34.060]  globalist don't want you either. You're being hit by it all to idiots, idiots.
[1:58:34.060 --> 1:58:37.260]  There's all these people that think they're part of the power structure
[1:58:37.260 --> 1:58:40.060]  when you're not.

[1:58:50.060 --> 1:58:55.860]  Cold and flu season is upon us. Protect yourself with supernatural silver, a
[1:58:55.860 --> 1:59:00.980]  revolutionary new broad spectrum antibacterial. Recent advances in silver
[1:59:00.980 --> 1:59:05.100]  technology have resulted in a silver solution that can be used daily to
[1:59:05.100 --> 1:59:10.060]  prevent bacteria, viruses, mold and food poisoning, as well as help improve
[1:59:10.060 --> 1:59:15.300]  wound healing. Silver salt technology is safe enough to consume every day, while
[1:59:15.300 --> 1:59:19.780]  powerful enough to destroy the causes of many serious diseases like strep throat,
[1:59:19.780 --> 1:59:25.700]  staph, pneumonia, colds, flus and other harmful pathogens. This new technology is

[1:59:50.020 --> 2:00:00.020]  Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:00:05.020 --> 2:00:13.020]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[2:00:13.020 --> 2:00:23.020]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[2:00:43.020 --> 2:00:58.020]  In our own your own business. Wow, that's a loaded question. I would just rather have free money.
[2:00:58.020 --> 2:01:02.020]  And if it was from the government, that'd be okay. If you win a lottery, you win the
[2:01:02.020 --> 2:01:06.020]  lottery. You don't ask why, right? I wouldn't mind getting both, but I really
[2:01:06.020 --> 2:01:10.020]  would have rather have my own company. Who do you want for president? I want Obama.
[2:01:10.020 --> 2:01:14.020]  Cause Bush didn't know what he was doing. Can you name one way that he's helped you out?
[2:01:14.020 --> 2:01:20.020]  He gave me $200 when he turned to president. You got $200 from Obama?
[2:01:20.020 --> 2:01:26.020]  He gave everybody that had a disability $200 when he turned president.
[2:01:26.020 --> 2:01:30.020]  I remember that because I got $200. He said he helped you out. Can you name one
[2:01:30.020 --> 2:01:34.020]  way that he helped you out? Well, he helped us out, boss.
[2:01:34.020 --> 2:01:42.020]  Low incomes, better low incomes, Medicaid, Social Security, stuff like that.
[2:01:42.020 --> 2:01:46.020]  He's a good president. No matter who's president, they're going to take our money
[2:01:46.020 --> 2:01:49.020]  and they're going to distribute it out the way that they see fit.
[2:01:49.020 --> 2:01:54.020]  Are you for Obama or not? I don't like either of them. Well, you've got to make a choice.
[2:01:54.020 --> 2:02:01.020]  Would you vote for Obama because he's black? No. If someone didn't vote for him,
[2:02:01.020 --> 2:02:06.020]  do you think they would be a racist? No. Did you vote for him because he's black?
[2:02:06.020 --> 2:02:11.020]  No, I vote for him because what he stands for, man, he stands for helping people out.
[2:02:11.020 --> 2:02:15.020]  If someone were to not vote for Obama, do you think they would be racist?
[2:02:15.020 --> 2:02:18.020]  No, I just think they're looking for something else. That's all.
[2:02:18.020 --> 2:02:21.020]  Who you want for president? Gary Johnson.
[2:02:21.020 --> 2:02:26.020]  Okay. And are you tired of the lesser of two evils I take it?
[2:02:26.020 --> 2:02:29.020]  Well, the lesser of two evils is still evil.
[2:02:29.020 --> 2:02:34.020]  I think what we should do is stop voting for the lesser of two evils and vote for the good, you know?
[2:02:34.020 --> 2:02:37.020]  Obama's the guy. It's not the lesser of two evils for me.
[2:02:37.020 --> 2:02:41.020]  He is the president that I think should run the country again for the next four years.
[2:02:41.020 --> 2:02:45.020]  And I believe that Obama, he helped me out in many ways.
[2:02:45.020 --> 2:02:47.020]  Do you like Romney or do you like Obama?
[2:02:47.020 --> 2:02:55.020]  I don't like either personally, but I think my position is I'm tired of the lesser of two evils.
[2:02:55.020 --> 2:02:58.020]  Well, I'm tired of the greater of two evils. I don't want to vote for Romney.
[2:02:58.020 --> 2:03:02.020]  The United States of America sucks and I hate the snakes.
[2:03:02.020 --> 2:03:08.020]  Well, the reason why I think we should support President Obama because he did a lot of things, you know?
[2:03:08.020 --> 2:03:10.020]  Who was that he called? Sodomus? Who was that Sodomus?
[2:03:10.020 --> 2:03:11.020]  Bin Laden.
[2:03:11.020 --> 2:03:14.020]  Bin Laden, yeah. He did a really good job, man. I give him 100% on that.
[2:03:20.020 --> 2:03:22.020]  Caught a street fight on video.
[2:03:22.020 --> 2:03:25.020]  This is ex-serviceman from the nightly niche.
[2:03:25.020 --> 2:03:34.020]  I was taking care of business during the break. Right, it was a one-minute break for the hour after 15 years on this time clock.
[2:03:34.020 --> 2:03:40.020]  We're going to air more of these reports later in the hour. We got Dr. Corsi coming up.
[2:03:40.020 --> 2:03:49.020]  We love y'all and this is America and if we can get you people that don't live here to go back home, we'll have a better world.
[2:03:49.020 --> 2:03:51.020]  Thank you for going Greyhound.
[2:03:51.020 --> 2:03:59.020]  We got a bunch more of these clips. People thinking Obama gave him $200 and people did get $200.
[2:03:59.020 --> 2:04:03.020]  Bush did that where you got $300. What was it back in 2002?
[2:04:03.020 --> 2:04:06.020]  It said, a letter from Bush. He wants you to have $300.
[2:04:06.020 --> 2:04:09.020]  Oh, here's my check. Well, thank you.
[2:04:09.020 --> 2:04:11.020]  It's like Chavez type stuff.
[2:04:11.020 --> 2:04:20.020]  The government is now being reduced down to that with the last debate with Obama and Romney debating how many goodies they were going to give us.
[2:04:20.020 --> 2:04:27.020]  And then the media is like, it's pretty bad that Romney still says small businesses are good. We know they're the bad guys.
[2:04:27.020 --> 2:04:31.020]  We didn't build that. You know that.
[2:04:31.020 --> 2:04:35.020]  Dr. Corsi is coming up. He's zoomed in on Obama's ring.
[2:04:35.020 --> 2:04:39.020]  Obama, I have an article here that has a bunch of different little charmies and goods.
[2:04:39.020 --> 2:04:42.020]  We've covered this before, but Michael Schneider is breaking it down.
[2:04:42.020 --> 2:04:45.020]  American Dream, his blog, got it up at infowars.com.
[2:04:45.020 --> 2:04:52.020]  If you want to read that, and we're going to get into NYPD. Concern about Iran terror should put U.S. security on alert.
[2:04:52.020 --> 2:04:54.020]  That is all coming up.
[2:04:54.020 --> 2:05:20.020]  Straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones. The websites are infowars.com, prisonblana.tv.

[2:05:27.020 --> 2:05:33.020]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, E-Foods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply.
[2:05:33.020 --> 2:05:37.020]  I recently increased my supply from E-Foods Direct because we've all known this was coming.

[2:08:19.020 --> 2:08:32.020]  Welcome back to another hour of worldwide broadcast. I'm your host Alex Jones. The news websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, and we also channelcast video streams at PrisonPlanet.tv and InfowarsNews.com.
[2:08:32.020 --> 2:08:40.020]  Coming up at the bottom of the hour, I'll continue with your calls and also play a news clip where we went out and talk to people on the street about the Obama phone.
[2:08:40.020 --> 2:08:49.020]  And some of them said, yeah, I think the government should give people basically free everything. Housing, you name it. So North Korea, the nightmare that creates.
[2:08:49.020 --> 2:08:59.020]  Now, I reported on this four years ago that Obama carries these different occultic charms. And we've listed some of those little charms.
[2:08:59.020 --> 2:09:05.020]  In fact, I have a photo of them. You can just type in guys, Obama's charms, because he's shown them to the news before.
[2:09:05.020 --> 2:09:15.020]  But he also, again, wears a ring that has Islamic Arabic script on it. And, of course, he didn't give up his name and become very satirical.
[2:09:15.020 --> 2:09:26.020]  He didn't go to Muslim school. I'm not anti-Islam. But the fact is, if the president's lying about what his religion is, that should be at issue here.
[2:09:26.020 --> 2:09:37.020]  And, of course, on top of that, now he is putting jihadis into Libya, Syria, and other areas. But hey, Mitt Romney has come out and said, bring down Assad.
[2:09:37.020 --> 2:09:42.020]  So our government, NATO, is allied with Al Qaeda. That's a large contingent. Even the CFR admits it.
[2:09:42.020 --> 2:09:50.020]  Of what's happened, I want to talk to Dr. Corsi about that. He's worked at the State Department, worked in security, worked in a bunch of classified areas.
[2:09:50.020 --> 2:09:57.020]  He's the best-selling author of New York Times. He writes for WorldNet Daily. And he's got one of the biggest stories out there right now.
[2:09:57.020 --> 2:10:04.020]  Obama's ring, there is no God but Allah. And he's breaking this down as a student at Harvard Law School.
[2:10:04.020 --> 2:10:13.020]  Then, Bachelor of Barack Obama practice of wearing a gold band on his wedding ring finger puzzled his colleagues.
[2:10:13.020 --> 2:10:23.020]  And now there's a newly published photos of Obama. In the 1980s, shows the Ring Obama Award as wedding ring as an unmarried student in the same ring.
[2:10:23.020 --> 2:10:31.020]  Michelle Robinson put on his finger a couple of wedding ceremonies in 1992. And it is the ring of no God but Allah.
[2:10:31.020 --> 2:10:39.020]  There is no God but Allah. Dr. Corsi, thanks for coming on on Short Notice on this. Wow, what a discovery.
[2:10:39.020 --> 2:10:44.020]  I'm sorry to be with you. I guess I've been writing about the rings since July.
[2:10:44.020 --> 2:11:00.020]  It was when I first discovered that photographs of Obama going back to Occidental in 1981 showed him wearing this wedding ring, this gold band on the wedding ring finger of his left hand.
[2:11:00.020 --> 2:11:15.020]  And at the time, I mean, I just had no idea what it was about or what it meant. I found then a Harvard Law Review. There was a parody issue, a satire done in 1990 when Obama was the president of the law review.
[2:11:15.020 --> 2:11:31.020]  They did up this doers scotch ad, which was popular at the time. And in the ad featuring Obama, his latest accomplishments were listed as persistently deflecting questions about why he's wearing the ring.
[2:11:31.020 --> 2:11:48.020]  So I knew that Obama was wearing this ring since 1981 and not answering questions about what it was about. Then I realized it was wearing the wedding ring had always been considered to be this Indonesian ring.
[2:11:48.020 --> 2:11:53.020]  Now that Jody Cantor wrote a story in the New York Times in 2010, Huffington Post covered it.
[2:11:53.020 --> 2:12:03.020]  But again, when a man wears, it's been a big controversy, was he married before, was the older question, why is a man wearing a wedding ring on the wedding ring hand, the wedding ring finger?
[2:12:03.020 --> 2:12:07.020]  It was bazaar. And now we know what the ring was. That's what's breaking today.
[2:12:07.020 --> 2:12:16.020]  Precisely. And then I found, New Yorker just published some pictures of this ring from Occidental. Obama wearing the ring at Occidental College.
[2:12:16.020 --> 2:12:26.020]  And they were detailed enough. I could say that's the same ring that Obama wore for his wedding as the same ring he's wearing today in the White House.
[2:12:26.020 --> 2:12:37.020]  Clearly identifiable. Then I started looking at the face of the ring and Joel Gilbert, who has produced the movie, you know, the DVD Dreams for My Real Father.
[2:12:37.020 --> 2:12:47.020]  Joel is an Islamic expert. He speaks Arabic. He speaks Hebrew. And I showed it to Joel. Joel said, that ring says Allah.
[2:12:47.020 --> 2:12:57.020]  And he started it further. We showed it to Mark Gilbert, who's a very, very well-known Islamist and author of books on Islam.
[2:12:57.020 --> 2:13:06.020]  And Gilbert says that's the Shahada. In other words, it's the first part of a prayer that says there is no God but Allah.
[2:13:06.020 --> 2:13:12.020]  And by the way, when I saw this this morning, because I was on Mancow, broke last night at World Net Daily, I ran in and looked.
[2:13:12.020 --> 2:13:18.020]  And then I went and looked up Islamic rings and I looked up that prayer and there's, they're sold everywhere. That's it.
[2:13:18.020 --> 2:13:24.020]  I mean, he's wearing a Muslim ring. He is a Muslim. I mean, this is incredible.
[2:13:24.020 --> 2:13:38.020]  And it's the story. The ring is this is the Shahada prayer. In other words, the only prayer someone has to say in order to convert Islam is the prayer that's on this ring.
[2:13:38.020 --> 2:13:48.020]  It's the profession of faith. There's two parts to the expression of faith. One is there is no God but Allah. That's what's on the face of the ring.
[2:13:48.020 --> 2:13:58.020]  And his messenger is Muhammad. Yes. And the experts we're talking to today say they believe the second part of the phrase is probably written on the inside of the ring.
[2:13:58.020 --> 2:14:07.020]  Either that or it's implied that it's in the person's heart. But clearly on the face of the ring, it says there is no God but Allah.
[2:14:07.020 --> 2:14:15.020]  And this is a fund. This is the key prayer in Islam to profess faith as being a Muslim.
[2:14:15.020 --> 2:14:26.020]  Sure, there is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his messenger. That's it. And in fact, in the Azan, which is the call to prayer five times a day, you know, from the minaret.
[2:14:26.020 --> 2:14:33.020]  So in the Middle East, you'll hear the Azan. The Azan includes the Shahada. This is like saying by the blood of Jesus, we are saved.
[2:14:33.020 --> 2:14:41.020]  It's precisely, in other words, it's an expression of creed, it's an expression of faith. It's an expression that it's a maxim for the Nazis.
[2:14:41.020 --> 2:14:56.020]  It was Hal Hitler. The same type of recognized statement. And also, see, the other part of this, Alex, is that if you're an Arabic speaker, if you're Muslim, if you can read Arabic script and calligraphy,
[2:14:56.020 --> 2:15:02.020]  you look at this ring, you see it. You see it. Oh, that's the Shahada. That's the prayer. There is no God but Allah.
[2:15:02.020 --> 2:15:11.020]  If you're, you know, an infidel, if you're a Christian, if someone who doesn't know Arabic or Arabic calligraphy, it just looks like curvy lines.
[2:15:11.020 --> 2:15:24.020]  So you wouldn't see it and recognize it, which, you know, appears again to fit right with the principle of taqiyyah in Islam, which is a practice of fooling infidels,
[2:15:24.020 --> 2:15:37.020]  but kind of wink, wink, letting the, letting those who are Muslims know you're one of them. And a ring like this, worn by Obama at every occasion on the White House, doesn't take it off.
[2:15:37.020 --> 2:15:50.020]  Certainly in meetings with Muslims, international meetings with Muslims, giving a speech in Cairo, it would have been a signal to Muslims, hey, I'm one of you, I'm wearing a ring professing faith in Allah.
[2:15:50.020 --> 2:16:01.020]  Unbelievable. And again, I am just absolutely blown away by this. And you've got links to the Harvard Law Review. It's on record. Now there's more photos of him wearing it.
[2:16:01.020 --> 2:16:10.020]  But again, he has all these CIA connections, as you know. Is this not on an elaborate ruse? Because boy, if he's supposedly helping the Muslims, he's putting the radicals in.
[2:16:10.020 --> 2:16:19.020]  He's blowing up any civilized areas. He's working with Al Qaeda, trying to get a civil war going. I don't think that really helps the average Arab or Muslim very much.
[2:16:19.020 --> 2:16:32.020]  Well, you know, I've maintained, Alex, for some time now that Obama in the New World Order crowd, including George Soros, has damaged goods, including the CIA.
[2:16:32.020 --> 2:16:42.020]  I think there's a massive effort here to take Obama down. Because I think Obama served his purpose to these people. They'd rather have, you know, the Romney in there.
[2:16:42.020 --> 2:16:53.020]  Romney is much more of a slick New World Order type. Now, if Romney wins, and look, I'm working hard and I've worked hard now for four years to beat Obama.
[2:16:53.020 --> 2:17:04.020]  I think Obama, if Obama has four more years, we lose our fundamental freedoms in our free enterprise system. I'm sure they'll all still be opposing Romney if Romney is the president.
[2:17:04.020 --> 2:17:10.020]  Sure. You wrote all those books, Exposing SPP, NAFTA, The Globalist, all of it, which by the way, there's a new big chapter on that, as you know.
[2:17:10.020 --> 2:17:15.020]  They're moving forward with that again. It is incredible, but why would he prance around with this?
[2:17:15.020 --> 2:17:23.020]  So this is basically like a message, but it's the classic thing. People don't know gang signs. They don't know what it says on the wall.
[2:17:23.020 --> 2:17:30.020]  So it's basically running up his flag, I guess, to manipulate the Muslims to follow him. It's just beyond bizarre.
[2:17:30.020 --> 2:17:44.020]  Well, it's an insider. I'm one of you, in other words. And Takia, you could profess that, hey, I'm Christian and lie because, you know, in Christianity, lying is a sin.
[2:17:44.020 --> 2:17:52.020]  You're not supposed to lie, but in Islam, if you lie in the advancement of Islam, it's part of the practice that's considered acceptable.
[2:17:52.020 --> 2:18:02.020]  Well, I think they get that, though, from the Israelites sneaking into the city and there's the spies and they lie. I mean, I think they're pointing to the Bible on that. I mean, I'm not defending the whole thing.
[2:18:02.020 --> 2:18:17.020]  It is a communication to those who can read Arabic and know the calligraphy, who will recognize that the ring has the Shahada prayer in it. There is no God but Allah.
[2:18:17.020 --> 2:18:23.020]  So where do we go from here? What does this signify? And how does this tie into him openly injecting al-Qaeda into Syria?
[2:18:23.020 --> 2:18:32.020]  Well, where I think it goes, I think we now we're at a point where, you know, Obama has professed all this time to be a Christian. He's wearing this ring.
[2:18:32.020 --> 2:18:44.020]  Let's just start with the first point. It demands an answer. Let's just be fully reasonable here. Let's say, you know, for 30 years, you know, Mr. President, you've worn this ring and refused to explain it.
[2:18:44.020 --> 2:18:55.020]  We now believe we've got confirmation from experts. The ring says there's no God but Allah. Why are you wearing this ring? Why does it mean such a significance to you?
[2:18:55.020 --> 2:18:59.020]  I don't have any piece of jewelry I've had for 30 years.
[2:18:59.020 --> 2:19:05.020]  And reduce the ring to the public. And who gave it to us? And what's on the inside?
[2:19:05.020 --> 2:19:13.020]  I was it used as the wedding ring because it was represented as a wedding ring that this was a new ring. It's the same ring he's had since...
[2:19:13.020 --> 2:19:19.020]  I mean, you know, the word is for years. Have you seen any truth to the fact that that Michelle Obama is his beard?
[2:19:19.020 --> 2:19:31.020]  Well, I've been reporting on that because, again, the people of Trinity United are now talking and the story of Obama being homosexual and the marriage with Michelle being an arranged marriage.
[2:19:31.020 --> 2:19:42.020]  Part of the down low club of Reverend Wright. I now have from many multiple very credible sources within Trinity United and I've reported it openly in WND.
[2:19:42.020 --> 2:19:51.020]  Yeah, stay there. Tell us about his beard. And for those that don't know, that's a homosexual man, you know, Hollywood style deal where you have a wife.
[2:19:51.020 --> 2:19:56.020]  Even you have kids with him sometimes as your cover. And this has been going around for a decade about Obama.
[2:19:56.020 --> 2:20:01.020]  But Dr. Courts, he's a pretty credible guy and he's saying... And the reason this is important is they can blackmail him with the info.
[2:20:01.020 --> 2:20:16.020]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers. The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.

[2:23:00.020 --> 2:23:16.020]  Hi there. My name is Frank Bates. What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds could get me in a lot of trouble. I just created a free video presentation at 123coverup.com that exposes the electricity monopolies and government agencies for what they really are.
[2:23:16.020 --> 2:23:31.020]  Incompetent line crooks that are counting on your ignorance and fear to keep your power bills criminally high. Some have called this a conspiracy. Others have called it a cover-up, and you will be shocked to find out how deep the conspiracy goes.

[2:23:51.020 --> 2:24:02.020]  Watch my video now at 123coverup.com before they force me to shut it down. Again, that's 123coverup.com.
[2:24:21.020 --> 2:24:35.020]  In this article this morning, I went and I looked up these terms and these rings, and there's just hundreds of pages of them for sale. That's what Obama is wearing. And again, we've been against all these wars and attack on the Muslims.
[2:24:35.020 --> 2:24:54.020]  I've known it's a clash of civilizations to get them all stirred up to have this big war and the globalists use that as a way to take our liberties domestically. But it is a fact he's putting Wahhabis and Jihadis into Libya and Syria. His contender is doing it as well, calling for more.
[2:24:54.020 --> 2:25:05.020]  It's so immoral. I want to get into that briefly with Dr. Corsi, who's been in the Middle East, been stationed there, knows a lot about this, worked in intelligence briefly, but finishing up with the homosexual area.
[2:25:05.020 --> 2:25:20.020]  Look, for me, I'm not even going after him for that on a moral front. I'm not even going to debate that. The issue is that they can blackmail him with this information, just like Bill Clinton we know was blackmailed.
[2:25:20.020 --> 2:25:26.020]  What intel do you have? I mean, more and more you're saying you've got credible witnesses that this is what Obama's doing.
[2:25:26.020 --> 2:25:38.020]  Yeah, I've got people from Trinity United who were not willing to talk six months ago, who now are openly discussing Obama's homosexuality and his arranged marriage with Michelle.
[2:25:38.020 --> 2:25:58.020]  It's no longer a secret. And I think it's being widely discussed in the community, tied to the murder of Donald Young, who was the African American choir director at Trinity, who in 2007 was executed execution style bullets to the back of the head.
[2:25:58.020 --> 2:26:13.020]  And it was widely rumored at the time that Donald Young was Obama's lover, and this was an attempt to cover up Obama's homosexuality. That murder put a damper, until now, on people in Trinity being willing to talk.
[2:26:13.020 --> 2:26:17.020]  They're opening up at Trinity. The testimony is open about Obama.
[2:26:17.020 --> 2:26:21.020]  They better go public like Larry Sinclair. They're going to end up Arkansas-ed.
[2:26:21.020 --> 2:26:36.020]  Well, and also see Larry Sinclair. Now, that was another important break for Larry. Larry's defamation case. Remember the guy who did the lie detector test against Larry, a guy named Parisi sued Larry for defamation.
[2:26:36.020 --> 2:27:00.020]  Larry said that Axelrod paid Parisi three quarters of a million dollars to falsify the lie detector test and make it as Larry had lied. A federal district judge, federal district court judge, through the defamation case out, would not even let it be heard, said that Larry had not obviously lied and that Parisi had not made his case.
[2:27:00.020 --> 2:27:11.020]  So that was a big step in Larry Sinclair's credibility that he had twice had homosexual sex with Obama, involving a limousine and cocaine.
[2:27:11.020 --> 2:27:14.020]  Well, Obama does look an act like he's on drugs.
[2:27:14.020 --> 2:27:30.020]  Well, and again, I think these are issues. I agree with you, Alex, the issue here, especially with the homosexuality. I'm not making a lifestyle argument. I'm making a hypocrisy and national security argument.
[2:27:30.020 --> 2:27:46.020]  You've got Obama saying he's in support of same sex marriage. The administration is very much behind an LGBT agenda. If Obama's living a lifestyle that is not heterosexual marriage to Michelle, he's hiding this homosexuality.
[2:27:46.020 --> 2:28:01.020]  Well, I'll say this. When he is addressed gay and lesbian groups, he definitely gets more fruit boxy and I'm not being mean about that. He just kind of gets really excited and it's like he's in his element and my gaydar turns on. I mean, you know, I'm not trying to, again, I don't get into these issues.
[2:28:01.020 --> 2:28:05.020]  I don't judge people. I got bigger frist of fry. It's just that I think there's a lot of credibility to this.
[2:28:05.020 --> 2:28:23.020]  Well, and again, the stories are coming out of Trinity. It's reminding me, Alex, of when John Kennedy was president and the stories were beginning to circulate. And I'm believing that after Obama leaves office, whenever that point occurs, you're going to find a revision of the Obama
[2:28:23.020 --> 2:28:38.020]  administration instead of Jack Kennedy with mistresses all over the place and you're going to find homosexual affairs. And it's been widely being discussed, including Reggie Law. Well, I mean, look at how much of there is in Congress on both parties.
[2:28:38.020 --> 2:28:42.020]  I mean, what is the deal with Congress? Is it like a bathhouse or something?
[2:28:42.020 --> 2:28:58.020]  It's been a problem in Washington for a long time. But, you know, again, Alex, this is let's bring up one more point. I've written extensively about, you know, Ambassador Stevens, who again, there's excellent evidence evidence was gay.
[2:28:58.020 --> 2:29:12.020]  Now, again, the point is not to demean the lifestyle of being gay. The point is that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama are actively recruiting LGBT foreign affairs officers, and they're placing them in Muslim countries.
[2:29:12.020 --> 2:29:18.020]  Which are statistically highly promiscuous and highly able to infiltrate with sex operatives.
[2:29:18.020 --> 2:29:29.020]  Yes. And also, these countries have, you know, take offense to the decadent lifestyle. It's what they consider it. And yet we put a gay, I mean, I reported we have...
[2:29:29.020 --> 2:29:36.020]  Tell you what, do five more minutes with us on that. And then I want to ask you about using al-Qaeda in these countries. And we'll look at everybody's calls and special reports. Can you do five more minutes?
[2:29:36.020 --> 2:29:37.020]  Yes, I can.
[2:29:37.020 --> 2:29:50.020]  All right, Dr. Kors, he's with us. On short notice, we'll be right back to go over more of this. He's with worldanddaily.com. I'm Alex Jones of infowars.com. Stay with us.
[2:29:50.020 --> 2:30:00.020]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:00.020 --> 2:30:13.020]  Aaron Fullen here. As the food police shut down food co-ops, the Amish and small farmers, Americans are losing access, not just to raw milk and homemade cheeses, but to healthy, home-crafted sources for fermented foods like sauerkraut, yogurt, and kefir.
[2:30:13.020 --> 2:30:20.020]  It seems there's a war on life-giving foods with living enzymes and healthy bacteria. But frankly, I'm not sure what the food police are so afraid of.
[2:30:20.020 --> 2:30:28.020]  These remarkable foods have been around since the beginning of history, with archaeological evidence for fermented foods and beverages being found across the globe in almost every culture.
[2:30:28.020 --> 2:30:36.020]  Even today, Japanese eat miso, Africans eat fermented porges, Koreans eat kamichi, and in India, fermented milk is a staple for healthy living.
[2:30:36.020 --> 2:30:43.020]  But here's some good news. Self-reliant Americans can now discover the secrets to making these amazing fermented foods legally and privately in their own homes.
[2:30:43.020 --> 2:30:51.020]  Since it's still legal to make these foods as long as you can make them yourself, for more information, check out fermentationfactor.com. That's fermentationfactor.com.

[2:33:12.020 --> 2:33:26.020]  Al Qaeda and the fact that the West is openly using them to overtake these countries that haven't attacked anybody. Libya, Syria, what's the in-game in all this? What are the Obamanoids trying to do there and finish up with the ambassador statement?
[2:33:26.020 --> 2:33:33.020]  Can we have a minute? I'm just finishing an interview.
[2:33:33.020 --> 2:33:47.020]  The call just came in. He agreed to come on, but then he forgot he had other interviews, so we may not be able to get that question answered. Real fast, Doc, finish the question about what's the grand strategy inside the system openly using Al Qaeda?
[2:33:47.020 --> 2:34:14.020]  Well, again, I think it's a failed policy by Obama. It's one of the reasons I think that Obama is going to be taken down because he's destabilized the Middle East. Al Qaeda has risen. I think even Russia is opposed to this. The New World Order wants a relatively unstable Middle East, but they don't want it in chaos. They don't want Al Qaeda in control. Al Qaeda's dude is kind of okay.
[2:34:14.020 --> 2:34:25.020]  I've talked to some pretty high-level elites in government and corporations, and they really think he's a double-cross working for some Muslim caliphate, and I thought that was just propaganda, but more and more, you're saying that could really be what's going on?
[2:34:25.020 --> 2:34:34.020]  I think he's a double-cross. I think he's off the page, and I think the New World Order, including the CIA, is going to turn on Obama, and he's going to go down.
[2:34:34.020 --> 2:34:51.020]  All right, Dr. Corsi, thank you so much. Look forward to having you back up soon. There he goes. Okay. I said I'd go to your calls. People are on hold. I want to hear from you. I've got some other very important news to hit here. It's just all going insane, and I've got a special report, too.
[2:34:51.020 --> 2:35:02.020]  But let's go to Paul in Texas, listing on 1630 AM KKGM. I guess it's up in Dallas, Fort Worth area. Great affiliate up there. Paul, you're on the air. Welcome, sir.
[2:35:02.020 --> 2:35:28.020]  I got a quick question for you. I've been hearing you bringing up how flow-like water is bad for us. Now, my question is, given that toothpaste has flow-like, is this main component? Is this toothpaste bad for us, or the flow-like on toothpaste?
[2:35:28.020 --> 2:35:48.020]  Let me answer that question for you. Did you have any other questions? No. Okay, thank you for the call. Look, there's different types of fluoride. Okay, there are different acids of sodium fluoride that have their molecular structure manipulated to make them even more toxic and acidic.
[2:35:48.020 --> 2:36:04.020]  And that's the type of acid they put in the water. They take the base sodium fluoride mixed with hundreds of other toxic chemicals in high amounts, and they put that in the toothpaste.
[2:36:04.020 --> 2:36:17.020]  It's toxic waste that they have to store somewhere. They mine fertilizer out of the ground, the phosphate industry. And there's also aluminum byproduct is sodium fluoride. A nuclear weapons development and fuel-ride development has a lot of fluoride involved.
[2:36:17.020 --> 2:36:31.020]  So they had tons of this left at the end of the World War II Manhattan Project. They said, well, the Soviets put it in the water. This is on record to dump people down. The Nazis followed suit from them, learned that when they had a deal with Stalin before the war started and they broke their pact.
[2:36:31.020 --> 2:36:52.020]  The Nazis split up Poland. Side issue. The point is, is that they put a large amounts of highly psychoactive adjuvant-type fluoride into the water. And they put it also in the toothpaste at very high levels.
[2:36:52.020 --> 2:37:06.020]  Small amounts of regular calcium fluoride are good for you and do strengthen your teeth and bones, and you do need it. You need tiny amounts. I mean, that's why eating an apple. There's some arsenic in it. There's some lead. There's some mercury.
[2:37:06.020 --> 2:37:22.020]  But it's bound in with the things. And you would die if you didn't have microscopic amounts of arsenic lead, mercury, things like that. Even cyanide was one of the cancer treatments because there's cyanide bound up in the apple seeds, in the cherry seeds and things like that.
[2:37:22.020 --> 2:37:29.020]  It's kind of a natural chemotherapy. I'm not recommending you do that. You can just go look at those.
[2:37:29.020 --> 2:37:42.020]  Oh, what's the, he's written a book about it. He's really, we ought to get you ever griffin on about this. He takes the, what's a little green, the little, they're like oranges, but they're not. They have a name.
[2:37:42.020 --> 2:37:51.020]  No, no, not loquats. It's a, it's got a seed that they say is the best mix of it. The point, apricots, apricot seeds. There you go. Thank you.
[2:37:51.020 --> 2:38:20.020]  The point is, is that there's good trace amounts of things and then there's bad industrial styles of it. So they'll argue and say, hey, you need some fluoride. Well, yeah, what type of fluoride and how much of it, you know, is there when you get plant derived minerals at the finer, you know, health food stores, it will say on their trace amounts of, you know, lead arsenic, things like that, because, well, yeah, sure, your blood's got 10 to 20 times that.
[2:38:20.020 --> 2:38:30.020]  In it naturally, but, but just technically you can say it's in the air. Okay, so it's not like you get a little bit of arsenic and it kills you. You actually need it for cell production.
[2:38:30.020 --> 2:38:39.020]  A little trick, if you want to make somebody really, really sick, if you stick a horse hair in a cigarette, back when people used to smoke in a minute, it'll almost kill you.
[2:38:39.020 --> 2:38:52.020]  Because it releases cyanide when it burns, because that's already what's in our building blocks. So it's a complex issue, but my dad, I don't know, 15 years ago said, son, fluoride is good for your teeth.
[2:38:52.020 --> 2:39:00.020]  I agree. It's not good in the water in their studies, but you need it. Well, that was before he saw the literature and went, well, this is industrial, different type of fluoride.
[2:39:00.020 --> 2:39:10.020]  Just like the head dentist, you can look this up and forget his name, in Canada 20 years ago, promoted, hey, we need fluoridation here, until he realized, well, this is toxic waste fluoride, with a bunch of other stuff added to it.
[2:39:10.020 --> 2:39:20.020]  So there's some truth, yeah, you need some fluoride, but not that type and not in that amount. It's like they also spray sodium fluoride on the crops as pesticide.
[2:39:20.020 --> 2:39:31.020]  The EPA finally got forced to say, okay, let's not use that anymore, but they're phasing it out. It's in powdered eggs, powdered milk. It levels that are hundreds of parts.
[2:39:31.020 --> 2:39:45.020]  I've seen it in powdered eggs at 600 parts per million. The studies show 1.3 parts per million massively reduces IQ. That's 1.3 parts per million, and they've got 300, 400, 500, 600 in some of these foods.
[2:39:45.020 --> 2:39:55.020]  Unbelievable. White flour a lot of times has it in it, so it's compounding.
[2:39:55.020 --> 2:40:10.020]  I've talked to my dad about this. We've looked at the research. His argument is, if you could get sodium fluoride toothpaste removed, that would be a good thing, but some calcium fluoride in there would probably be good.
[2:40:10.020 --> 2:40:18.020]  Again, reality is so much more complex, so it gets dumbed down to a point that it's hard to even communicate all this information.
[2:40:18.020 --> 2:40:31.020]  But I remember 10 years ago going to the health food store and getting liquid vitamins and stuff when my son had been born because I'd read that was good to put some of that in his juice and stuff when he was like a year old and go into the people at the store going.
[2:40:31.020 --> 2:40:40.020]  He says it has trace amounts of lead, mercury, and arsenic, and they explain it, and they just have to put that under federal law because anything that's out of plants, you're juicing plants in a juicer.
[2:40:40.020 --> 2:40:52.020]  You're going to have trace amounts of that, so they have to tell you that. That's government, though, trying to make vitamins look bad and real minerals look bad, using and playing on people's ignorance to basically answer your question.
[2:40:52.020 --> 2:41:01.020]  I always get long-winded when the callers bring up a point like that, but I do not brush my teeth. I got a call last week saying, well, what do I do? All the toothpaste is fluoride.
[2:41:01.020 --> 2:41:08.020]  And I just happened to have been in the store the day before. It hadn't put it in my office yet. It was sitting out there on my little desk. I have a radio desk, too.
[2:41:08.020 --> 2:41:19.020]  And it was my natural deodorant. It was my natural toothpaste. It's great. I've been brushing my teeth for, it's got to be 20 years with non-fluoride toothpaste.
[2:41:19.020 --> 2:41:26.020]  And I just look at them. Oh, yeah, hugs. No filling, no caps.
[2:41:26.020 --> 2:41:32.020]  Actually, I was monthly going to take a picture of my toothpaste, so they were scary. And here it is. Here's what I use. This is what you use.
[2:41:32.020 --> 2:41:40.020]  Natural Tea Tree Oil Meme Toothpaste. That's a Rob Dude fluoride-free. And I've used this brand. I use a bunch of them. I always try different stuff.
[2:41:40.020 --> 2:41:51.020]  And I got a cracked tooth from a fight, and that was fixed. The kind of white tooth-colored filling is falling off, so it's cracked.
[2:41:51.020 --> 2:41:58.020]  Like, look, get my teeth cleaned three times a year. Got my wisdom teeth, too. Look at this. Here, zoom in.
[2:41:58.020 --> 2:42:05.020]  Yeah, wisdom teeth. I'm also streaming video of your radio listener. Yeah.
[2:42:05.020 --> 2:42:12.020]  All right, that's no fillings, no nothing. Well, let's be technically accurate.
[2:42:12.020 --> 2:42:21.020]  My wisdom teeth came in with developmental pits, holes naturally in the sides of them that my dad, every five years or so, refills with tooth-colored fillings.
[2:42:21.020 --> 2:42:26.020]  So let's be technical. I do have tooth fillings in my mouth, but I don't have fillings from decay.
[2:42:26.020 --> 2:42:31.020]  Okay, let's go ahead and talk to Neville in Canada. Thank you for holding Neville.
[2:42:31.020 --> 2:42:35.020]  Hi, long-time listener, first-time caller. Thank you, sir.
[2:42:35.020 --> 2:42:54.020]  Yeah, what you said about Bill Mars reminded me of, from the clip from the movie, the documentary movie called United States vs. John Lennon, where they say John Lennon worshipped life, but Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger worshipped death.
[2:42:54.020 --> 2:43:08.020]  Well, that's right. In fact, we have John Lennon saying that people live in compact cities, that 90-plus percent of the earth is uninhabited, and that we need more children to replace the parents or society would collapse.
[2:43:08.020 --> 2:43:20.020]  He was really smart. I mean, really smart. And he woke up with the Illuminati, his last songs that never get any play were about the Illuminati and devil worshipers and how they were running things, and he was going to expose them.
[2:43:20.020 --> 2:43:28.020]  And then we had the letters from Strom Thurmond saying, I want this guy taken out. You know, to Nixon, the Senate was like, get rid of him. People are listening to him.
[2:43:28.020 --> 2:43:36.020]  And we can play the clips of him on TV, saying the earth's not overpopulated and it's all a lie. We just need to get better technologies and all this.
[2:43:36.020 --> 2:43:42.020]  And so you're absolutely right. Yep, that's right. John Lennon worshipped life, Richard Nixon worshipped death. Well said.
[2:43:42.020 --> 2:43:54.020]  Also, one point about Florida is that the largest city in Canada has Florida added to the water. Try to tell people that. Luckily, I live, I do not live there. I live in Florida.
[2:43:54.020 --> 2:44:02.020]  We just got it pulled out in Calgary, right? Yes, I was all so happy about it. They took out the water in Calgary. I love that.
[2:44:02.020 --> 2:44:12.020]  Largest city, Toronto, the largest city in Canada has Florida in the water. But where I live, there's no Florida in the water. Happy about that. And interesting. Okay.
[2:44:12.020 --> 2:44:22.020]  And my other point, oh, quotes, two quotes, number one, quote, it says, do not give in to evil, but proceed ever more boldly against it.
[2:44:22.020 --> 2:44:33.020]  And the other quote is, God, God, give me the courage to not give up fighting for what I know is right, even if I feel that it is hopeless.
[2:44:33.020 --> 2:44:41.020]  I hear you. God bless you because it is the fight that it's all about. It's that heart decision. You know, I'll say this, I am at peace.
[2:44:41.020 --> 2:44:47.020]  And I love God. And I know that we're reaching exponentially millions of new people a week now.
[2:44:47.020 --> 2:44:53.020]  I mean, the show is just absolutely exploding. And it's an incredible responsibility to have this happening.
[2:44:53.020 --> 2:45:09.020]  But I'm also saddened when other talk show hosts, even on this network, other people outside who attack me and do things behind the scenes that I'm told about and confirm.
[2:45:09.020 --> 2:45:17.020]  And they do it out of pure jealousy and envy and make stuff up and do terrible things. And I'm not sad that they're hurting me because they're not hurting me.
[2:45:17.020 --> 2:45:29.020]  I'm sad for them. You know, I mean, it's because I used to be a harder person. And as I realize good and evil more and more, more and more of my worldly fields are gone now.
[2:45:29.020 --> 2:45:33.020]  Because in the past, I would just laugh about somebody being jealous.
[2:45:33.020 --> 2:45:43.020]  And now it hurts me that they're so bad that there's such failures. And it scares me for humanity of what's going to happen during the collapse.
[2:45:43.020 --> 2:45:51.020]  That people are so snake like and weak and envious and jealous and hate other people that are successful because they're successful.
[2:45:51.020 --> 2:46:00.020]  It's the nature of envy and in gratitude and weakness and the love of death and lies and fraud and scurrying around.
[2:46:00.020 --> 2:46:11.020]  I mean, just thinking about people that are like that is like, oh, I mean, I don't know, I've just really changed a lot.
[2:46:11.020 --> 2:46:19.020]  I'm more attuned to things around me now that I used to be and picking up on people and I get more freaked out by ugliness now.
[2:46:19.020 --> 2:46:24.020]  Not ugliness. I mean, ugliness of the soul.
[2:46:24.020 --> 2:46:30.020]  One day I was down at the big local natural spring, Fred Pool. I just swam about two miles.
[2:46:30.020 --> 2:46:36.020]  I got out and I saw this gross potbellied old man. But when he grows, he was potbellied. I thought, man, that guy looks like a goblin.
[2:46:36.020 --> 2:46:38.020]  He just looks like a demon. He looks evil.
[2:46:38.020 --> 2:46:43.020]  He had these super skinny arms that were so skinny. He looked like a cartoon character.
[2:46:43.020 --> 2:46:47.020]  Sometime out of a Hellraiser movie and he was slothfully moving and walking.
[2:46:47.020 --> 2:46:55.020]  And I thought, that's wrong. Don't go with your gut. Being old isn't ugly because it didn't be ugly. There's a beauty to some old people.
[2:46:55.020 --> 2:47:01.020]  And I thought, but he just looks so demonic. And he couldn't even tell I was looking at him because I had a ball cap on.
[2:47:01.020 --> 2:47:04.020]  And I was about a hundred yards away and as he walked, it was like spiritual.
[2:47:04.020 --> 2:47:10.020]  He turned. I'm sitting there on the grass getting dried off and he looks at me and smiles and digs a big bugger out of his nose.
[2:47:10.020 --> 2:47:21.020]  And this goes now and just this tongue like a God. And I was like, and now every once in a while I'll be swimming and that guy's in there and actually have like an adrenaline rush of, oh, you know, I mean, and I've kind of, it's just,
[2:47:21.020 --> 2:47:30.020]  the thing about becoming a better person and closer to God is you start really seeing evil and like the spirit made his body ugly.
[2:47:30.020 --> 2:47:33.020]  You know, it was like the guys that he knew and it was like the spirit. It was like spiritual.
[2:47:33.020 --> 2:47:43.020]  He looked over and ate a bugger in front of me and stuck it in his mouth and licked his lips like 10 feet away. And I was like, oh, I mean, but it wasn't the act of eating the bugger.
[2:47:43.020 --> 2:47:55.020]  It was like a demonic thing. And I was like, oh, oh, I mean, it was, it's not even frightening. It's like, it's evil. I just don't like it. It's like, ah, and so when I see people weak and envious and bad,
[2:47:55.020 --> 2:48:03.020]  and I get angry and stuff about wanting to fight the globalists and over rev like a race car, you know, I've got my own problems. I'm not on some high horse.
[2:48:03.020 --> 2:48:14.020]  In fact, my own problems freak me out now and make me get upset. And it's not because I'm self-flagellating myself, beating myself and I'm some goody two shoes and a delicate violet that can't handle things.
[2:48:14.020 --> 2:48:30.020]  I'm now analyzing myself and seeing what I'm like. And it's just freaking me out. It's freaking me out. I just, I mean, he didn't, he wasn't even looking at me when I was looking at him and I was drawn off.
[2:48:30.020 --> 2:48:45.020]  And I'm right as I look up. He just turned and just went and I was just like, oh, and they just ate it and then licked his lips and went and just went gobbling off. And I was just like, whoa, whoa.
[2:48:45.020 --> 2:48:56.020]  And he swims like a demon to he gets his arms out of the sides and never swings. I mean, I just cannot describe you. Are you guys getting what I'm talking about here?
[2:48:56.020 --> 2:49:08.020]  I mean, and I just, I mean, and now I literally shudder when he's in the area. Because I mean, I'm telling you, that guy's got a big demon living in him, man. I mean, that is, you know, and that's the point is that you start really getting discernment folks.
[2:49:08.020 --> 2:49:21.020]  And it's like, because you'll find people try to act dark and powerful and big. They're not really evil. The devil tricked them that their strength is coming from the devil. When their strength is coming from God, they're just misusing it.
[2:49:21.020 --> 2:49:36.020]  I mean, I'm just figuring all this out. So, man, I know why the enemy's coming against us at so many levels is because we're really having an effect and we're for life and we're not for death and we're for justice and we want to be good and we know there's something good.
[2:49:36.020 --> 2:49:44.020]  And we are a model to others that you can be strong. You can be bold. You can be good. And the system hates it.
[2:49:44.020 --> 2:49:54.020]  And again, I, for my individual self, I can be destroyed, set up, just, you know, ruined. It's my character assassinated with fraud. I'm not even worried about me individually.
[2:49:54.020 --> 2:50:00.020]  But then I worry if I stumble and let them set me up or something, then that'll hurt all the people that look up to me.
[2:50:00.020 --> 2:50:15.020]  And then that's what's so scary about all this is that I don't want to let people down. And I don't even know what I'm talking about now. I'll go to break and come back with more of your calls.
[2:50:15.020 --> 2:50:30.020]  Skeletor is called in. One is that Donald Rumsfeld. I try to make jokes about it. But I'm telling you, the thing about evil is it sells this idea that it's sexy and big and powerful. And it always encases itself in that because it's really weak.
[2:50:30.020 --> 2:50:46.020]  And it's just a stinking, booger-eating, death-loving, grasping weakness trying to be strong. And it's time for good to stand up and step on it.
[2:50:46.020 --> 2:51:01.020]  I mean, if you could see the spirit of good, it's like a giant, trillion-foot-tall, powerful juggernaut, and we let these little goblins just run rampant on us while they run around eating boogers in front of us.

[2:54:37.020 --> 2:54:57.020]  It's presentplanet.tv memberships, see the nightly news, and to see the radio show, $5.95 a month, it's really six memberships at the price of one, so a dollar a month per membership as you can share your username and passcode.

[2:55:44.020 --> 2:55:51.020]  There is a fight between good and evil. And if we will stand up against evil and recognize it, we can turn the tide.
[2:55:51.020 --> 2:55:55.020]  But if we just decide that, oh, there's nothing we can do, hell is going to be manifest.
[2:55:55.020 --> 2:55:59.020]  Nelson in Georgia, thanks for holding. Now you're listening via iTunes.
[2:55:59.020 --> 2:56:03.020]  And we've got Bill listening on WTAN 1340 AM in Florida.
[2:56:03.020 --> 2:56:07.020]  And we're going to go to Overdrive. Going to Overdrive and going to do that.
[2:56:07.020 --> 2:56:10.020]  Nelson in Georgia, go ahead. Thanks for holding.
[2:56:10.020 --> 2:56:22.020]  Hey, Alex, I talked last week and I'm a research scientist and I want your listeners to be aware of the technology they keep from us. Stan Meyer in the 80s invented the process where a vehicle on the planet could run off of water.
[2:56:22.020 --> 2:56:29.020]  Pond's Fleischman with cold fusion. They totally buried that. It's all from Nikola Tesla's work.
[2:56:29.020 --> 2:56:40.020]  And I was wondering if you were aware about the Fox News thing where the CEO of Overstock.com was on there. I said he was going to write in Ron Paul, which is pretty cool.
[2:56:40.020 --> 2:56:49.020]  And also that Russians are dumping 14 nuclear reactors out there in the Arctic Sea, which are just leaking, leaking poison into our ocean.
[2:56:49.020 --> 2:56:59.020]  I mean, if you want to talk about, well, under the communists, I know they did it in lakes and in the ocean, yet totally psycho crazy.
[2:56:59.020 --> 2:57:06.020]  Communists always do stuff like that. They always have the worst environment. Russia doesn't do too much of that now because they're more, oh, it's just horrible.
[2:57:06.020 --> 2:57:11.020]  These idiots that think big government is the answer have no historical lens.
[2:57:11.020 --> 2:57:20.020]  Yes, I did know that they've dumped dozens and dozens of reactors into the North Sea in places that, I mean, that ought to be illegal.
[2:57:20.020 --> 2:57:26.020]  But again, they say, we'll give us a global government. We'll fix it. Oh, the globalists are all into it. They're crazy.
[2:57:26.020 --> 2:57:36.020]  You know that we have the technology to change the molecular properties of those nuclear fuel rods so they won't be poisonous anymore, but they don't give it to us.
[2:57:36.020 --> 2:57:39.020]  They just let that stuff leach into our oceans.
[2:57:39.020 --> 2:57:45.020]  I'm just aware of that. People don't know that they've, for like 50 years, they're able to create even new elements.
[2:57:45.020 --> 2:57:53.020]  They've created a whole bunch of new elements. People have no idea. That's what I mean. It's all, it's so, reality is so wild and incredible.
[2:57:53.020 --> 2:57:57.020]  And reality, folks, is not reality TV.
[2:57:57.020 --> 2:58:05.020]  I mean, knowing this now, though, I mean, even like three years ago, it was cool to be on Jesse Ventura's TV show or have Discovery Channel, History Channel call up.
[2:58:05.020 --> 2:58:10.020]  I've refused a couple of Discovery and History Channel shows the last six months. BBC, I've refused.
[2:58:10.020 --> 2:58:17.020]  I think this Sunday night, secrets of the secret societies is going to air on the Discovery or History that I'm in, and I'm not even going to watch it.
[2:58:17.020 --> 2:58:23.020]  And now I just say no to them. They're like, you're saying no to national television? Yeah, I'm saying no.
[2:58:23.020 --> 2:58:28.020]  I don't know. I might say yes down the road, but probably not. I just don't care anymore. None of it means anything.
[2:58:28.020 --> 2:58:32.020]  All these pathetic, jealous people of us. You have no idea. I've transcended you.
[2:58:32.020 --> 2:58:39.020]  I'm absolutely outside of your petty jealousy and all your crud. Folks, we're going to have no future if we don't come together right now.
[2:59:02.020 --> 2:59:10.020]  The fruits, vegetables, and wheat are all impacted, raising prices. The cost to feed livestock is forcing farmers and ranchers out of business, blowing up your food prices.
[2:59:10.020 --> 2:59:18.020]  The only strategy to counter this is to freeze your food cost at today's prices by getting your own supply of foods from eFoods Direct now.
[2:59:18.020 --> 2:59:23.020]  As the price of raw ingredients increases, eFoods will have to raise prices too. Now is the time to get your supply.
[2:59:23.020 --> 2:59:30.020]  I recently increased my supply from eFoods Direct because we've all known this was coming. You know about their delicious, long-term, storable foods.
[2:59:30.020 --> 2:59:38.020]  The fact is you can eat at any time to save money today, and because it's stored for 25 years, you're locking in today's prices and avoiding the rising food cost.
[2:59:38.020 --> 2:59:48.020]  Don't wait. Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex. Call 800-409-5633 or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.

[2:59:51.020 --> 2:59:59.020]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[2:59:59.020 --> 3:00:25.020]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:25.020 --> 3:00:33.020]  That's right, Jim, and in a few calls here, more coming up as they try to start an open hot war with Sharia via Turkey.
[3:00:33.020 --> 3:00:41.020]  Bill in Florida, a WTAN 1340 AM listener, one of our, I don't know, we have like 10 affiliates in Florida now.
[3:00:41.020 --> 3:00:45.020]  One of our great affiliates down there. Bill, thanks for holding it on the air, sir.
[3:00:45.020 --> 3:00:51.020]  You're welcome, Al. It's the first time I've spoke to you. I want to tell you something about what Michael medved to the shot at you the other day.
[3:00:51.020 --> 3:00:56.020]  But before I get into that, I want to ask you, what do you know about technology stocks and companies?
[3:00:56.020 --> 3:01:01.020]  I don't know. I mean, I know I have general knowledge. I don't know how to fix a computer.
[3:01:01.020 --> 3:01:05.020]  I read the big white papers about the future of the Internet and where the globalists are going.
[3:01:05.020 --> 3:01:11.020]  So I understand the larger structures, but I don't really follow technology stocks a ton.
[3:01:11.020 --> 3:01:22.020]  I know that, I mean, generally, I don't want to comment on it because it's such a complex issue. But look, everybody's taking a shot at me now.
[3:01:22.020 --> 3:01:28.020]  I mean, because, you know, the systems tried to suppress us and now we're going supernova.
[3:01:28.020 --> 3:01:32.020]  I mean, the show is just exploding. And so the attacks are coming.
[3:01:32.020 --> 3:01:41.020]  But Medved has attacked me many times. I was at the RNC in 2000 and 2004 in New York.
[3:01:41.020 --> 3:01:48.020]  And I just politely walked over and said, Mr. Medved, Michael Medved, I'd like to interview you.
[3:01:48.020 --> 3:01:52.020]  And he went, Alex Jones, you're the guy that says they're going to blow things up.
[3:01:52.020 --> 3:01:55.020]  And he was like trying to get everybody scared to get secret service or something.
[3:01:55.020 --> 3:02:00.020]  And I understood what he was doing. And I retreated because he wanted to get my credentials, obviously, take any smile and laugh.
[3:02:00.020 --> 3:02:04.020]  I ran you out because they know how to use that fear to herd the cattle.
[3:02:04.020 --> 3:02:08.020]  But what did the little pathetic talk show host say about me?
[3:02:08.020 --> 3:02:12.020]  Well, before I get into that real quick, I came back to the technology thing.
[3:02:12.020 --> 3:02:16.020]  There was an analyst on there, two of them, as a matter of fact.
[3:02:16.020 --> 3:02:20.020]  They're talking about this Christian-based company that's based in China.
[3:02:20.020 --> 3:02:30.020]  And he claims, or they both say that this is going to be the next Apple of China, and it's called China Tech Faith Wireless.
[3:02:30.020 --> 3:02:37.020]  It currently trades on that. It's a symbol of CNPF, that's China, Nancy Tom Frank.
[3:02:37.020 --> 3:02:42.020]  And they were real hot in the stock. And the stock is, I think, only about a dollar a share.
[3:02:42.020 --> 3:02:46.020]  But they said they feel that this thing is going to be the next Apple, and this thing is going to skyrocket.
[3:02:46.020 --> 3:02:52.020]  And we hear that all the time, and I don't know enough to say, you know, if it's real or a pump and dump, I just don't know.
[3:02:52.020 --> 3:02:56.020]  See, if I focused on stocks, I'd be obsessed on it, and then I would know about it.
[3:02:56.020 --> 3:03:01.020]  But instead, I just realized it's a big casino in the sky. It's all about insider knowledge.
[3:03:01.020 --> 3:03:05.020]  And it's all about the insiders, basically, more and more robbing everybody.
[3:03:05.020 --> 3:03:11.020]  But I mean, China is, if China doesn't collapse, it will be the center of the world.
[3:03:11.020 --> 3:03:17.020]  It's kind of an all-or-nothing situation, from my perspective. But so what did Medved say?
[3:03:17.020 --> 3:03:22.020]  About a week and a half or two ago, he had a guy in there, a substantiating.
[3:03:22.020 --> 3:03:27.020]  Medved's all about fluoride. And he was saying, because I know he was taking a shot at you,
[3:03:27.020 --> 3:03:33.020]  don't be listening to these conspiracy shows where they tell you that fluoride is bad for you.
[3:03:33.020 --> 3:03:35.020]  No, no, he's attacking me by name many times. I don't even pay attention to him.
[3:03:35.020 --> 3:03:39.020]  People send me the clips. I'm not surprised he doesn't even use my name anymore.
[3:03:39.020 --> 3:03:44.020]  I mean, look, they're upset that it's coming out, that the American Medical Association has said,
[3:03:44.020 --> 3:03:48.020]  take it out of the water. I mean, that's now in the news.
[3:03:48.020 --> 3:03:51.020]  What he was hoping his audience didn't know that?
[3:03:51.020 --> 3:03:59.020]  Medved was all pro-fluor. He says, you keep, never mind drinking that bottle of water.
[3:03:59.020 --> 3:04:04.020]  He said, you drink it right of that cap of the fluorine, all because it's good for you.
[3:04:04.020 --> 3:04:07.020]  And that's how he did it. And he was like almost demonic the way he sounds.
[3:04:07.020 --> 3:04:12.020]  He was like, you take it, you scum. He felt you drink what I tell you.
[3:04:12.020 --> 3:04:16.020]  Well, listen, food is at the center of the family, everything. And the hearth.
[3:04:16.020 --> 3:04:19.020]  And they want to tell you what to eat. And they do. They tell parents,
[3:04:19.020 --> 3:04:23.020]  you don't bring your school lunch. You drink what we drink. You take what we take.
[3:04:23.020 --> 3:04:26.020]  And we're going to make you take vaccines. And they're like,
[3:04:26.020 --> 3:04:30.020]  because it's what you're going to take you cattle.
[3:04:30.020 --> 3:04:31.020]  So anyways.
[3:04:31.020 --> 3:04:34.020]  You ought to check out his, I think it's on Tuesday.
[3:04:34.020 --> 3:04:39.020]  He has his once a week show where it's conspiracy Tuesday or something.
[3:04:39.020 --> 3:04:43.020]  And he debunked, tried to debunk everything that you have, supposedly conspiracy.
[3:04:43.020 --> 3:04:47.020]  Yeah, well, I mean, I'm, we're rising. He's, I don't know.
[3:04:47.020 --> 3:04:49.020]  I mean, really, I'm on the map.
[3:04:49.020 --> 3:04:51.020]  So whatever. Great for him. Good for him.
[3:04:51.020 --> 3:04:55.020]  It actually hurts me that he's so evil. I mean, it's a pathetic creature.
[3:04:55.020 --> 3:04:58.020]  All right. We'll be back. Stay with us. Infowars.com.
[3:04:58.020 --> 3:05:04.020]  Back tonight, seven o'clock, present one of our TV.
