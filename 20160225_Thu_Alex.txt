[00:00.000 --> 00:12.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.240 --> 00:21.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:21.000 --> 00:27.080]  we knew that they would have a new attack ready for Trump when he dominated
[00:27.080 --> 00:33.240]  almost getting double the votes of the second-place winner Marco Rubio in Nevada
[00:33.240 --> 00:37.720]  and ahead of Super Tuesday next week Trump is set to have a tsunami win he's
[00:37.720 --> 00:43.040]  suddenly surging to a dead tie in major polls with Senator Ted Cruz in his home
[00:43.040 --> 00:47.960]  state Texas he is clearly gonna probably beat Rubio coming up in Florida the
[00:47.960 --> 00:52.640]  system is in panic as drudge report comes out with the headline that he is the
[00:52.640 --> 00:58.320]  nominee of the people Donald J. Trump and so we talked to Trump insider Roger
[00:58.320 --> 01:01.560]  Stone a few days ago he's gonna be in studio Friday he said the new attack
[01:01.560 --> 01:05.600]  will be that Donald Trump is mafia and Donald Trump is corrupt and Donald Trump's
[01:05.600 --> 01:10.480]  finances we've seen the IRS persecute Christians and gun owners and veterans we
[01:10.480 --> 01:14.560]  know they've done it openly MSNBC said it's good persecute people they deserve
[01:14.560 --> 01:19.640]  it they're the racist tea party and so you can't work in places like New York
[01:19.640 --> 01:24.240]  City and not run into some of that stuff with businesses they're digging into
[01:24.240 --> 01:27.520]  that a decade ago somebody that he did a little bit of destruction with got
[01:27.520 --> 01:31.280]  indicted this is the type of garbage they're gonna use and the reason I'm
[01:31.280 --> 01:36.440]  shooting a special report is we've got the articles we've got the clip where
[01:36.440 --> 01:42.960]  Mitt Romney was on Neil Cavuto at about what three o'clock central on this
[01:42.960 --> 01:46.640]  Wednesday and was going I don't know what the dirt is and I don't know what
[01:46.640 --> 01:51.200]  the financials aren't I'm not saying I've seen it or it even exists but I gotta
[01:51.200 --> 01:54.840]  tell you you know there's gonna be something big in the finances of Trump
[01:54.840 --> 01:59.480]  and boy we just don't want to go with him and have Hillary get in well they
[01:59.480 --> 02:03.520]  can make stuff up about Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio or anybody else but they won't
[02:03.520 --> 02:06.960]  give those people play ball Trump says he wants to audit the private Federal
[02:06.960 --> 02:09.360]  Reserve he doesn't want multinational corporations that are based here to be
[02:09.360 --> 02:13.600]  tax exempt that's not fair he said he wants to control our borders and have
[02:13.600 --> 02:16.960]  sovereignty he's against political correctness he wants to 28 pages on
[02:16.960 --> 02:22.520]  Saudi Arabia 9-11 to be released and the bushes nobody else is doing that this
[02:22.520 --> 02:26.680]  is so positive it's so populist he's riding that wave they've tried to
[02:26.680 --> 02:30.040]  cheat him at every level but it's failed because the people have seen through it
[02:30.040 --> 02:35.280]  and I think the establishment is going to have even bigger problems if they
[02:35.280 --> 02:39.000]  continue to try to go against the will of the people and the huge awakening
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.240]  that's happening now Trump may not be perfect and he might turn into a man on
[02:42.240 --> 02:46.160]  a white horse but we know the establishment we have now has been
[02:46.160 --> 02:49.280]  running things in the ground and wants to make us poor so they can micromanage
[02:49.280 --> 02:52.400]  us because they've already stolen the wealth these people are not capitalist
[02:52.400 --> 02:56.720]  these people are fascist using socialism to domesticate the population now
[02:56.720 --> 03:00.680]  let's go to this clip and understand they're scared of Donald Trump and this
[03:00.680 --> 03:07.960]  is the next big push the fact that he is is so aggressive in avoiding any
[03:07.960 --> 03:12.520]  discussion of taxes of his taxes and is not willing to put them out so far
[03:12.520 --> 03:16.800]  suggest that there's something in there he doesn't want us to see frankly I
[03:16.800 --> 03:21.640]  think we have good reason to believe that there's a bombshell in Donald Trump's
[03:21.640 --> 03:26.280]  taxes listening to governor Romney and the issue that he just brought up yeah
[03:26.280 --> 03:30.640]  what do you think of that I think that Donald Trump's gonna have some explaining
[03:30.640 --> 03:35.920]  to do I think that every question is gonna go back to that and and you've
[03:35.920 --> 03:41.120]  got Hillary Clinton on one side who's noticed how it's key scripted points
[03:41.120 --> 03:45.560]  that they're both saying in unison on Cavuto show with Cavuto sitting there
[03:45.560 --> 03:48.680]  nodding his head this is the establishment scripting everything
[03:48.680 --> 03:52.920]  Rupert Murdoch is on record as a Hillary supporter this is Hillary through
[03:52.920 --> 03:58.200]  Fox News trying to take out Donald Trump well well if you can't stand the
[03:58.200 --> 04:02.640]  heat y'all not getting the kitchens kind of the old saying about running for
[04:02.640 --> 04:06.600]  a presidency the United States they're gonna ask you about everything and if
[04:06.600 --> 04:10.080]  you don't have a legitimate answer I don't know or I'm not gonna tell you is
[04:10.080 --> 04:15.120]  not appropriate so we've got Mitt Romney we've got Rick Perry the guy that lied
[04:15.120 --> 04:18.440]  and said Gardasil shots with the law in Texas we've got all these establishment
[04:18.440 --> 04:20.920]  Republicans coming out and saying we don't know what's in there but it's gonna
[04:20.920 --> 04:24.840]  be bad it's gonna be big I can barely even know what's going on in my own
[04:24.840 --> 04:28.280]  daily life with my checkbook in my life because I'm running so much stuff and my
[04:28.280 --> 04:32.920]  life's probably 120th as complex running a major media operation as Donald Trump's
[04:32.920 --> 04:36.520]  so now we already know what the attack is from stone again they're gonna go in
[04:36.520 --> 04:41.080]  to maybe one maybe two people that he's worked with in huge construction deals
[04:41.080 --> 04:45.800]  out of hundreds he's done that ended up be bad people and claim that he's tied
[04:45.800 --> 04:51.120]  in with that we know Hillary and Obama financed ISIS to kill tens of thousands
[04:51.120 --> 04:57.720]  of Christians the full video is up on info wars dot com leaked the Republican

[08:55.640 --> 09:02.480]  got my heart racing and that never happens on air number one they had a
[09:02.480 --> 09:08.440]  high-level New York Times employee columnist come out and say we need to
[09:08.440 --> 09:15.440]  kill Donald Trump and then put a video out from a film of a populist
[09:15.440 --> 09:20.760]  politician basically being assassinated or trying to be assassinated by
[09:20.760 --> 09:27.160]  Christopher Walken and of course who he's trying to assassinate is the person
[09:27.160 --> 09:30.880]  running for president played by Martin Sheen it's bizarre I know both those
[09:30.880 --> 09:37.320]  guys but expanding on this it's the left's praise of it and their tweets
[09:37.320 --> 09:43.040]  saying yes let's kill Donald Trump now I wonder if he's found dead with a pillow
[09:43.040 --> 09:47.240]  over his face and there's no autopsy will you be a conspiracy theorist to call
[09:47.240 --> 09:50.760]  for law to be enforced and for there to be an investigation we're gonna go over
[09:50.760 --> 09:58.440]  this in great detail it's top-linked right now on drudgereport.com
[09:58.440 --> 10:03.240]  New York Times columnist jokes about assassination attempt ending Trump's
[10:03.240 --> 10:10.240]  campaign info wars.com Paul Joseph Watson and then at the bottom of the
[10:10.240 --> 10:14.440]  report is a very powerful video I shot yesterday with the info wars nightly
[10:14.440 --> 10:18.720]  news leaked New Republican plan to destroy Trump we played part of that
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.320]  report but not the finale at the start of the last segment some stations don't
[10:24.320 --> 10:28.880]  carry that first segment so that's up on info wars.com both of those in that
[10:28.880 --> 10:34.320]  article are extremely extremely extremely extremely important and I'm
[10:34.320 --> 10:39.880]  asking all of you info warriors to pass that story on to everyone you know we're
[10:39.880 --> 10:45.640]  gonna be going over in great detail separately I've been up since six o'clock
[10:45.640 --> 10:53.040]  this morning working on this and Paul Joseph Watson is working on a story
[10:53.040 --> 10:59.280]  right now so is Kit Daniels and quite frankly they already had stories ready
[10:59.280 --> 11:11.080]  to go and I said stop we don't follow the news we lead the news and on this
[11:11.080 --> 11:18.760]  piece of Scalia news I'm about to cover when I woke up this morning and saw a
[11:18.760 --> 11:35.840]  text message from Joe Beggs and one from Leanne McAdoo it blew me away it was in
[11:35.840 --> 11:39.640]  the Washington Post it was also in the Daily Mail and a bunch of other
[11:39.640 --> 11:45.880]  publications and when I read it I knew exactly what they were doing we had
[11:45.880 --> 11:48.680]  Clinton and Sider Larry Nichols on yesterday who did talk to one of the
[11:48.680 --> 11:55.840]  surviving conservative justices I think you can guess who we're talking about I
[11:55.840 --> 11:59.360]  don't know the point of not just admitting who it is the government
[11:59.360 --> 12:05.960]  already sent feds out to Nichols house to threatening but I won't say the name
[12:05.960 --> 12:10.720]  and he said there is a federal investigation about to start a special
[12:10.720 --> 12:15.320]  investigator special counsel and there's a private investigation Dick Cheney said
[12:15.320 --> 12:21.160]  quote no comment when he was asked by the media and then I get up at 6 o'clock
[12:21.160 --> 12:31.200]  this morning stumble into the bathroom put water on my face brush my teeth
[12:31.520 --> 12:36.040]  that's just my ritual then I go into the shower take a hot shower for five
[12:36.040 --> 12:40.720]  minutes take a second shower after I work out a long one it's just my ritual
[12:40.720 --> 12:46.320]  and I went in and sat down at the coffee table and turned on my iPad and it was
[12:46.320 --> 12:53.040]  mirroring texts from Leanne and Biggs at like one in the morning they weren't
[12:53.040 --> 12:59.880]  together but they were both texting me then and I saw the headline
[12:59.880 --> 13:06.080]  Justice Scalia spent his last hours with members of a secretive society of
[13:06.080 --> 13:13.480]  elite hunters man they're good at spending stuff
[13:15.120 --> 13:26.480]  man they're good and engaging in disinformation this point Dexter fellow
[13:26.480 --> 13:35.360]  was in black ops in the army not just in Vietnam but all over the world Nichols
[13:35.360 --> 13:43.440]  who was involved in Iran contra as a commando leading teams says he's
[13:43.440 --> 13:51.800]  basically been at this guy's ranch the one they would run out of out of one
[13:51.800 --> 13:58.280]  country into another down in Central America that was yesterday you add to
[13:58.280 --> 14:12.320]  that that they would spend this and say that it was a hunting secret society I
[14:12.320 --> 14:17.560]  am other than the people that are in these cults the leading outside expert on
[14:17.560 --> 14:24.200]  them but let me just give you a crash course before we go into this article
[14:24.200 --> 14:28.440]  then I'm getting into Trump then we're gonna have video reports the photos
[14:28.440 --> 14:37.560]  exclusive Intel inside that ranch at the bottom of the next hour there was a
[14:37.560 --> 14:42.360]  Renaissance starting in about 1500 in Europe that was unseating the Catholic
[14:42.360 --> 14:47.600]  Church's power and the nobility's power who were ran monopolies and wouldn't
[14:47.600 --> 14:52.800]  let anybody basically be a cobbler who made shoes or anything else seen as
[14:52.800 --> 14:57.320]  industrial unless you were given a certification licensed by the nobility
[14:57.320 --> 15:02.320]  and that caused the dark ages because they didn't want any competition the
[15:02.320 --> 15:08.880]  dark ages from about 14 all the way up till about 1500 more than a thousand
[15:08.880 --> 15:18.320]  years can also call it the Middle Ages a shorter period in there and if you
[15:18.320 --> 15:23.200]  understand this you understand the entire system of the battle in the West
[15:23.200 --> 15:29.520]  for the future the Roman Empire falls later the Byzantine Empire falls to the
[15:29.520 --> 15:38.920]  Muslims and Constantinople Rome almost falls in the 800s there are crusades
[15:38.920 --> 15:44.520]  out of France and England led by the Norse the Vikings who had conquered
[15:44.520 --> 15:55.280]  England and France the Norse who also sounded Russia crush the invaders in six
[15:55.280 --> 16:00.800]  different major invasions killing millions on both sides almost
[16:00.800 --> 16:08.160]  depopulating the Middle East and areas of Europe a death battle
[16:08.160 --> 16:17.600]  by the 1400s people are sick of the tyranny of the monopolies of the
[16:17.600 --> 16:23.720]  nobility in the church and they begin to use what's left of ancient masonry and
[16:23.720 --> 16:30.560]  ancient pre-christian secret societies that I would not call satanic
[16:30.560 --> 16:40.480]  definitely occultic and hidden to try to form a system to challenge the
[16:40.480 --> 16:45.360]  establishment and bring in a new enlightenment they team up with the
[16:45.360 --> 16:51.680]  Rosicrucians an ancient Christian sect predating Roman Catholicism and the
[16:51.680 --> 17:01.280]  Orthodox Church both but they were mystics those groups merge and from the
[17:01.280 --> 17:06.920]  middle of the 1400s to the 1760s they had overthrown the real power of the
[17:06.920 --> 17:12.960]  monarchies and started the Reformation and had driven a tyrannical form of
[17:12.960 --> 17:18.560]  Catholicism out of much of Europe incredible prosperity was booming
[17:18.560 --> 17:24.600]  monopolies were being broken power of the people under different acts like
[17:24.600 --> 17:32.280]  Magna Carta expanding through we're empowering the people
[17:32.440 --> 17:37.040]  comparatively none of it was perfect both sides had problems both sides began
[17:37.040 --> 17:42.480]  to infiltrate each other I'm gonna skip the network break this is so important
[17:42.480 --> 17:54.120]  Christians and masons that actually followed Christ by that point Christian
[17:54.120 --> 18:01.880]  masons launch their operations in the colonies and believe they were finally
[18:01.880 --> 18:08.160]  going to have a truly free country to empower humanity and the goal was to
[18:08.160 --> 18:13.600]  end slavery empower women ever had to be done in phases they launched the entire
[18:13.600 --> 18:18.680]  operation that was Francis Bacon's plan the new Atlantis they defeat the
[18:18.680 --> 18:23.800]  British Empire that no one ever stopped working with the French that had
[18:23.800 --> 18:28.800]  launched their own plan the problem was the German Illuminati led by Adam
[18:28.800 --> 18:35.360]  Visop a Jesuit had launched a counter-revolution secretly in the 1760s
[18:35.360 --> 18:40.680]  and when he saw the 1776 revolution launch he went operational with their
[18:40.680 --> 18:45.080]  counterfeit 1776 I know this from George Washington he wrote a bunch of
[18:45.080 --> 18:48.680]  letters on it but it's also in the histories so you got George Washington in
[18:48.680 --> 18:52.880]  the West battling the head of the Illuminati a Satanist in the in the
[18:52.880 --> 18:58.880]  East classic battle and they killed him they poisoned him they bled into death
[18:58.880 --> 19:01.720]  he was poisoned they came in they bled into death they killed George Washington
[19:01.720 --> 19:12.520]  getting ready to come back into politics and face them they killed him and so
[19:12.520 --> 19:17.280]  there's been a battle between the German and they're not German but it's German
[19:17.280 --> 19:27.760]  based Ravarian Illuminati and the Western New Atlantis Renaissance group
[19:27.760 --> 19:31.360]  which is the real Illuminati they never call themselves that they said we're the
[19:31.360 --> 19:36.840]  Enlightenment so the Illuminati said oh we're the light they launched their
[19:36.840 --> 19:41.480]  counterfeit populist operation they come in and they infiltrate you can read
[19:41.480 --> 19:45.160]  what wise up writings because one of his letter carriers got struck down with a
[19:45.160 --> 19:49.000]  big manual that copies of it to be given to other members in France he got
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.120]  struck by lightning this is this is an encyclopedia Britannica by the way
[19:52.120 --> 19:56.680]  this is not my opinion he got struck down and again I'm an expert on this
[19:56.680 --> 19:59.320]  discovery channel history channel interview me and I know what I'm talking
[19:59.320 --> 20:03.680]  about I know the stuff 33 degree mason's no okay and I learned it from
[20:03.680 --> 20:08.280]  research and historical information it's all hidden right there and so what
[20:08.280 --> 20:13.280]  happened is this group branded itself and wise up said we'll take over the
[20:13.280 --> 20:16.960]  hunting societies and lodges for men that like to hunt like the company a you
[20:16.960 --> 20:21.400]  know guys that are under can bear the deer hunters we will take take over the
[20:21.400 --> 20:24.880]  reading societies and the literature societies and the music societies and
[20:24.880 --> 20:28.280]  then we will take over the sexual secret societies there's a lot of folks
[20:28.280 --> 20:30.960]  wanting to be able to have sex with more than one person or maybe they were
[20:30.960 --> 20:34.960]  gay or whatever so there were sexual secret societies and he said we'll
[20:34.960 --> 20:38.840]  claim that we support all of these that we're the original progenitors of these
[20:38.840 --> 20:41.200]  and we'll claim that we're the rosicrucians and the Christians and
[20:41.200 --> 20:45.120]  the Merovingians and all of it and then our plan is total dominance and
[20:45.120 --> 20:50.120]  control to get rid of the church and to get rid of Christianity and get rid of
[20:50.120 --> 20:54.720]  the Muslims as well and set ourselves up as absolute Luciferians over the
[20:54.720 --> 21:05.600]  world so when you read about Justice Scalia dying and there's a pillow over
[21:05.600 --> 21:08.680]  his head and they they got private jets at the airport but he's not put on those
[21:08.680 --> 21:13.720]  that by the way he flew in on that's now confirmed and then they drive him to
[21:13.720 --> 21:16.680]  another town and the actual suspicious and they changed their stories
[21:16.680 --> 21:22.200]  obviously something was being covered up now I was saying 98% chance they
[21:22.200 --> 21:25.640]  killed him before because of all the suspiciousness in the behavior now it's
[21:25.640 --> 21:30.040]  a 90% chance somebody killed him maybe less because it could have been they
[21:30.040 --> 21:34.040]  were involved in a bunch of rituals who knows who was out there they don't want
[21:34.040 --> 21:37.520]  this to come out they wanted to clean it up that place looks like something out
[21:37.520 --> 21:41.640]  of the shining as our crew said not just they are the dead stuff which which
[21:41.640 --> 21:46.640]  isn't satanic it's about celebrating your ancestors I've looked at it in November
[21:46.640 --> 21:50.680]  30th it's not Halloween nothing to do with it some of the occultists have
[21:50.680 --> 21:52.920]  jumped on the bandwagon but there were sculptures there we're going to be
[21:52.920 --> 21:56.160]  showing later for TV viewers and radio listeners that aren't just you know
[21:56.160 --> 22:00.120]  Mexican mask or voodoo mask some of it is occultic but actual sculptures of
[22:00.120 --> 22:06.240]  Satanism and children being sacrificed so the bottom of the next hour we're
[22:06.240 --> 22:12.480]  going to get to that in detail but I want to be clear I'm not saying Scalia was
[22:12.480 --> 22:18.880]  part of a satanic order but they're now being forced in the Washington Post to
[22:18.880 --> 22:23.960]  go okay there was a secret society meeting it's a Christian Catholic
[22:23.960 --> 22:30.400]  Society of Hunters that was around for 300 plus years and the Nazis destroyed
[22:30.400 --> 22:33.760]  it because they wouldn't make Herman Göring the head of it who was a big
[22:33.760 --> 22:41.880]  huntsman and they dumb it all down and now we're just admitting it then they go
[22:41.880 --> 22:46.440]  to say it was reconstituted in the 1960s at Bohemian Grove north of San
[22:46.440 --> 22:49.280]  Francisco so then you have to have the whole history of that I'm the guy that
[22:49.280 --> 22:53.520]  snuck in successfully infiltrated got the only footage out everybody else has
[22:53.520 --> 23:00.600]  been arrested or imprisoned I was able to do it by the grace of God it itself is
[23:00.600 --> 23:07.320]  a German death cult Illuminati so is skull and bones 1832 and a president
[23:07.320 --> 23:12.600]  taffed a member of skull and bones on the east coast founded by the Bavarian
[23:12.600 --> 23:17.680]  Illuminati that's on record in 1832 in the US 50 something years after it was
[23:17.680 --> 23:24.720]  founded in Germany lodge 3 2 2 by the 1870s was already traveling here before
[23:24.720 --> 23:28.160]  he was president and a taking over the Bohemian Grove that was a writers club
[23:28.160 --> 23:33.000]  and a party club to bring prostitutes to basically female prostitutes that
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.680]  marked 20 and others attended they kicked them all out took it over by the
[23:36.680 --> 23:42.760]  1900s and presidents began traveling there and they and they brought up
[23:42.760 --> 23:47.360]  Bavarian Illuminati rituals there now we have this from helmet Schmidt former
[23:47.360 --> 23:50.840]  German Chancellor author of men and powers of political retrospective he
[23:50.840 --> 23:54.240]  writes about it because we have our own groves we do our own Illuminati rituals
[23:54.240 --> 23:58.200]  it's a public book he goes more gets done at Bohemian Grove the Trilateral
[23:58.200 --> 24:04.520]  Commission the CFR and our own Bavarian groves for where we do rituals he was
[24:04.520 --> 24:07.320]  just the most important grove in the world and in my film I have the book I
[24:07.320 --> 24:11.840]  open it I show screenshots and I show the text in my film dark secrets inside
[24:11.840 --> 24:16.000]  Bohemian Grove and part two of that is the order of death they're both free
[24:16.000 --> 24:20.800]  online at YouTube you can buy them in DVD and higher res and m4store.com but I
[24:20.800 --> 24:28.240]  digress and we'll have some b-roll from my films later in the next hour this
[24:28.240 --> 24:37.920]  will be a day long remember now Bohemian Grove is founded by the Illuminati
[24:37.920 --> 24:45.000]  so it's going bones then it founds other chapters under it at a southwest Texas on
[24:45.000 --> 24:49.320]  the border 30,000 acre ranch with a black ops commander connected to Iran
[24:49.320 --> 24:53.640]  Contra who gets presidential awards from Obama and Scalia dies there with two
[24:53.640 --> 24:57.520]  private wide-body jets one of them he flew in on with his best friend and he's
[24:57.520 --> 25:01.080]  not put on that and flown back to DC that takes three hours he's driven three
[25:01.080 --> 25:06.960]  and a half hours to El Paso we knew there was a cover-up
[25:09.400 --> 25:14.400]  and they may have covered up the circumstances because it was Valentine's
[25:14.400 --> 25:18.840]  Day and Mr. Scalia wasn't with his wife he was out in the middle of nowhere a
[25:18.840 --> 25:24.640]  hundred miles from any town now I don't know what went on but I know what goes
[25:24.640 --> 25:29.640]  on at Bohemian Grove that Scalia has attended and it's in my films and it's
[25:29.640 --> 25:40.600]  what Wayne Madsen hinted at and got into and that is all men massively gay
[25:40.600 --> 25:47.920]  overtones but a lot of the men are not bisexual or homosexual and then in town
[25:47.920 --> 25:52.320]  there are hotels and golf course where it's chopped full of hundreds of the top
[25:52.320 --> 25:57.280]  prostitutes female of the world that arrive and this has been in Time Magazine
[25:57.280 --> 26:04.080]  Newsweek you name it articles about it and when I stuck in there 16 years ago I
[26:04.080 --> 26:07.880]  was pretty good-looking and I now realize why I was able to get in Mike
[26:07.880 --> 26:11.240]  Hansen was a good-looking fellow as well you can see in the footage and we were
[26:11.240 --> 26:14.400]  getting whistled at by people we had to hide out you're basically under a
[26:14.400 --> 26:19.880]  building until dark because guys were coming up trying to grab our butts and
[26:19.880 --> 26:23.120]  I'm talking about billionaires folks there's only like a thousand fifteen
[26:23.120 --> 26:27.360]  hundred you know members tops they can each have one guest I'm not saying
[26:27.360 --> 26:30.680]  Clint Eastwood goes there and he's a bad guy not most people go in there are not
[26:30.680 --> 26:36.200]  bad they have amazing music food all of it over a hundred camps inside it's
[26:36.200 --> 26:39.760]  inside a gorge on the Russian River it's beautiful one of the prettiest places in
[26:39.760 --> 26:49.600]  the world looks like Riviera and it's like the black forest and that's the
[26:49.600 --> 26:54.880]  outer room to be invited to that and then you get into the deeper Illuminati if
[26:54.880 --> 27:00.440]  you get vetted and if they like you it is a way to get to know you socially and
[27:00.440 --> 27:06.680]  let your hair down and again it's in my films that break all of it down in great
[27:06.680 --> 27:15.120]  detail so Scalia spent his last hours with members of a secretive society of
[27:15.120 --> 27:20.960]  elite hunters that's how they spent it they claim it's a order of st. Hubertus
[27:20.960 --> 27:28.080]  founded more than 300 years ago in Germany and Austria and reportedly
[27:28.080 --> 27:32.640]  points Dexter is a member of it and he's at the table surrounded by all this
[27:32.640 --> 27:40.880]  occultic regalia Scalia is an officer of it and this is a dead society destroyed
[27:40.880 --> 27:47.120]  by the Nazis that's resurrected at the Rivarian spinoff in Northern California
[27:47.120 --> 27:53.200]  Bohemian Grove now I told you about the order of death a very important 800 page
[27:53.200 --> 28:00.840]  book that I've read twice written by Heinz like Hobart's the name funny it's
[28:00.840 --> 28:04.520]  Hubertus is the saint and I read it in other historical books but this is from
[28:04.520 --> 28:07.920]  declassified documents the Nazis were getting rid of the old Illuminati because
[28:07.920 --> 28:16.800]  they didn't want anything that stood in their way and so because he wouldn't the
[28:16.800 --> 28:21.640]  leader of it wouldn't basically put Hermann Göring head of the German
[28:21.640 --> 28:28.320]  Luftwaffe Hitler's left-hand man in charge of it they killed the leader of
[28:28.320 --> 28:35.160]  the order and that's in the Washington Post and in the Daily Mail because they
[28:35.160 --> 28:38.160]  wouldn't let them take it over and that's in order of the death said that
[28:38.160 --> 28:41.580]  they were taking out the the the different Illuminati spinoff groups the
[28:41.580 --> 28:46.680]  Masonic groups all of them that didn't fully turn over their entire secret
[28:46.680 --> 28:51.680]  organization to the Nazis so people like to make these jokes oh Joan says German
[28:51.680 --> 28:58.720]  death cults run it all Germans you know Illuminati no it started there but it's
[28:58.720 --> 29:03.200]  a worldwide system of control and that's what it is so who could make this up that
[29:03.200 --> 29:07.960]  we have five reporters down there showing all the occultic iconography who
[29:07.960 --> 29:11.520]  could make this up that I'm in the middle of Bohemian Grove and that Joe
[29:11.520 --> 29:14.960]  Biggs tweeted out and put on his Instagram we're gonna show it later gonna
[29:14.960 --> 29:20.720]  line all this stuff up just show it all to you saying this is like Bohemian Grove
[29:20.720 --> 29:25.600]  2.0 well it turns out it is the Texas Bohemian Grove and they've got other
[29:25.600 --> 29:29.760]  ones around the country as well these are real Illuminati chapters and
[29:29.760 --> 29:34.520]  strangely enough you know I wasn't invited into chapters like these that
[29:34.520 --> 29:37.880]  were low-level or a bunch of drug heads acting like Satanist when I was a
[29:37.880 --> 29:42.800]  teenager I was actually invited in to the the feeding groups in Dallas into a
[29:42.800 --> 29:47.360]  Bavarian Illuminati satanic organization so my whole life has been connected to
[29:47.360 --> 29:54.400]  this we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:54.400 --> 29:56.840]  network
[30:00.040 --> 30:05.880]  Marco Rubio Wall Street's boy toy he's gotten more money from the elite donors
[30:05.880 --> 30:10.200]  and Wall Street than number two Jeb or even number three Hilary after blowing
[30:10.200 --> 30:15.800]  150 million dollars on Jeb they still haven't learned anything Jebs dropping
[30:15.800 --> 30:20.400]  out didn't help Rubio in Nevada Rubio is the establishment's 20% solution
[30:20.400 --> 30:24.080]  Jeb had a sense of entitlement kind of like the donor class in the party elite
[30:24.080 --> 30:28.440]  that support Rubio they believe they can openly oppose the voters on their key
[30:28.440 --> 30:32.920]  issues and still win but Rubio is a little smarter he realizes that his
[30:32.920 --> 30:36.640]  support for illegal immigration with a gang of eight was a betrayal of the
[30:36.640 --> 30:40.080]  voters but he still thinks they're too stupid to see through the lies it's
[30:40.080 --> 30:43.960]  called Breitbart a conspiracy website and the president of the ice union a
[30:43.960 --> 30:48.840]  liar when they exposed Rubio's betrayal with a gang of eight the Rubio's campaign
[30:48.840 --> 30:53.520]  will provide a useful public service identifying the GOP political class who
[30:53.520 --> 31:00.800]  will say anything to get elected for info wars comm I'm David Knight thousands

[35:16.800 --> 35:20.840]  all right let's get back to this epic news I mean Washington Post you name it
[35:20.840 --> 35:25.400]  oh hey he was in a secret society it's a hunting society yeah founded in Germany
[35:25.400 --> 35:30.840]  300 something years ago founded in Austria and the Hungarian Empire yeah and
[35:30.840 --> 35:35.280]  sure there's a place called Bohemian Grove that resurrected it and after the
[35:35.280 --> 35:40.320]  Nazis destroyed it in the early 40s and yeah there's black op commanders that
[35:40.320 --> 35:45.200]  get special awards from Obama that are part of it and Scalia died and he didn't
[35:45.200 --> 35:49.360]  they didn't take him back on the private jet there was no security there and they
[35:49.360 --> 35:53.120]  just wanted to all be alone out there on the 30,000 acres with skulls and demon
[35:53.120 --> 35:58.640]  faces everywhere and we have the footage of a bizarre bizarre demons eating
[35:58.640 --> 36:02.640]  little children we haven't shown that footage yet for TV viewers radio
[36:02.640 --> 36:09.720]  listeners can go to info wars.com forward slash show in fact can we roll some of
[36:09.720 --> 36:14.320]  that footage that actually shows the yeah look at this a dead woman with a
[36:14.320 --> 36:19.400]  demon above her in a ritual and when they pan down there's little dead
[36:19.400 --> 36:27.080]  children there there on the altar yeah that's not the footage I saw this morning
[36:27.080 --> 36:30.720]  that's some shaky weird footage we've got some other good footage I saw back
[36:30.720 --> 36:34.720]  there but you know our problem is we've just got so much footage of all of this
[36:34.720 --> 36:42.680]  and then Joe Biggs Instagramed out SSG Biggs sitting at the very chair where
[36:42.680 --> 36:47.120]  Scalia sat for dinner that night with all the demon and devil mask behind him
[36:47.120 --> 36:52.880]  and then right behind that just is more you know endless rooms of a bizarre
[36:52.880 --> 37:01.120]  satanic memorabilia isn't that just interesting so Scalia Justice Scalia
[37:01.120 --> 37:07.840]  spent his last hours with members of the secretive society of elite hunters so
[37:07.840 --> 37:12.320]  it okay guys we got trouble the help knows it was a secret society the help
[37:12.320 --> 37:15.560]  knows something weird went on they got investigators there's a federal
[37:15.560 --> 37:19.320]  investigation being launched that we told you about first year yesterday this
[37:19.320 --> 37:22.200]  is them talking we got to go ahead and get ahead of this being a secret
[37:22.200 --> 37:27.080]  society of a varying Illuminati deal what do we do well our feeder groups our
[37:27.080 --> 37:35.640]  hunting clubs sex clubs and reading clubs and so the front for this is a
[37:35.640 --> 37:41.240]  hunting club and so we'll just go ahead and run with that and that's what they
[37:41.240 --> 37:46.760]  did because again the hunting clubs the hunting secret societies this is one of
[37:46.760 --> 37:50.080]  the most elite in the world are the feeders into the real Illuminati which
[37:50.080 --> 37:54.280]  is why Bohemian Grove the real Illuminati in the US skull and bones
[37:54.280 --> 37:58.880]  created it was created by the German death cult German death cult was the
[37:58.880 --> 38:02.760]  granddaddy that gave birth to skull and bones that was the daddy and the mommy
[38:02.760 --> 38:06.320]  that gave birth to Bohemian Grove and now Bohemian Grove has grown up it's over
[38:06.320 --> 38:11.880]  115 years old and it's a big boy now and it's given birth to this that's been
[38:11.880 --> 38:16.400]  around for decades and they've got these things in Texas they've got them in
[38:16.400 --> 38:20.440]  Tennessee they've got them in New York you've seen eyes wide shut folks and
[38:20.440 --> 38:23.360]  there's different flavors different variants they worship different
[38:23.360 --> 38:28.000]  goddesses and different gods but they all lead back to the same thing so it's a
[38:28.000 --> 38:35.960]  big deal to have Scalia die in the middle of a secret society meeting should
[38:35.960 --> 38:41.600]  there be an investigation now well reportedly from a good source there is
[38:41.600 --> 38:46.480]  an investigation federally but also privately starting so what other
[38:46.480 --> 38:57.200]  revelations are going to be coming out now continuing ladies and gentlemen we
[38:57.200 --> 39:04.720]  are digesting all of this info and we are going to be breaking it all down
[39:04.720 --> 39:11.280]  here today coming up at the middle of the next hour and we have a special
[39:11.280 --> 39:17.680]  report that I've shot on this subject as well 15 years ago that we're going to be
[39:17.680 --> 39:26.760]  re-airing here just a snippet from my film dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove
[39:26.760 --> 39:31.840]  now some will argue and spin this these are just Mexican mask yeah from San
[39:31.840 --> 39:35.880]  Aria and voodoo folks and they have found thousands of dead bodies over the
[39:35.880 --> 39:40.160]  border in that very area of Mexicans sacrificed that's even been in Texas
[39:40.160 --> 39:44.000]  monthly but it's not even really known they don't really make movies about it
[39:44.000 --> 39:50.760]  it is so dangerous and dark down there very romantic very mysterious and most
[39:50.760 --> 39:56.000]  these masks you notice our devil mask and demon mask there's so many other masks
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.880]  down there and you know you could decorate a place with all the great
[39:58.880 --> 40:03.520]  Spanish and Mexican culture stuff but instead oh let's just go with devil
[40:03.520 --> 40:08.520]  stuff everywhere and then the books as Kit Daniels points out are about the
[40:08.520 --> 40:16.320]  fall of civilization Rome the Nazis world government the Illuminati that's
[40:16.320 --> 40:22.160]  what this is all about so that's who really rules this planet and they robbed
[40:22.160 --> 40:26.760]  the Renaissance they took over the real Illuminati you know Christ light of the
[40:26.760 --> 40:33.080]  world who's the devil the angel of light the false light masquerading as God and
[40:33.080 --> 40:37.440]  just like Bohemian Grove they've got the sculptures of the devil murdering
[40:37.440 --> 40:44.520]  women and children and tearing them limb from limb and Justice Scalia dies in the
[40:44.520 --> 40:50.240]  middle of this and they have to admit it was a German Austrian Hungarian secret
[40:50.240 --> 40:59.040]  society and Joe Biggs says it's like Bohemian Grove 2.0 last week and it is
[40:59.040 --> 41:04.400]  created by Bohemian Grove the Washington Post Justice Scalia spent his last
[41:04.400 --> 41:11.880]  hours with members of the secretive society of elite hunters and now we
[41:11.880 --> 41:14.800]  know who the secretive friend is he traveled with and there's jets on the
[41:14.800 --> 41:23.760]  tarmac ready to get him out and they didn't they drove him out and made sure
[41:23.760 --> 41:28.120]  there was no autopsy daily mail Justice Scalia spent his final hours in the
[41:28.120 --> 41:35.560]  company of a secret society of hunters that has existed since the 1600s as a
[41:35.560 --> 41:40.600]  researcher and a top expert top expert on this I've infiltrated one of these
[41:40.600 --> 41:44.920]  events and I was attempted to be inducted into it as a teenager repeatedly
[41:44.920 --> 41:48.960]  I mean I'm talking 20 bedroom mansions and stuff okay I'm not talking about
[41:48.960 --> 41:52.880]  some some crackhead over here acting like they're a Satanist or somebody
[41:52.880 --> 41:55.520]  wearing a pentagram you know around their neck and a rock band wanting power
[41:55.520 --> 42:01.520]  they think the devil gave them power when God gave him that talent the devil's
[42:01.520 --> 42:08.240]  trick is he gives you confidence that you already had and let me tell you get
[42:08.240 --> 42:12.160]  into powerful circles of people most of them are into the occult and most of them
[42:12.160 --> 42:15.400]  think the devil gave them their success
[42:15.400 --> 42:27.280]  I'll tell you this I'd give it over a 90% chance about a 90% chance that Scalia
[42:27.280 --> 42:32.160]  met with foul play the 100% chance there's a cover-up but I've gone from a
[42:32.160 --> 42:36.840]  98% chance that was foul play to you got a little bit of heart problems you're
[42:36.840 --> 42:44.800]  overweight you take Viagra you down there by yourself on Valentine's Day and
[42:44.800 --> 42:48.000]  you die of a heart attack and then they don't know what to do and it's the
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.880]  middle of a big party and then let's just get his body over here to a county
[42:51.880 --> 42:57.160]  we control let's not put him back on a jet get to DC you know the different
[42:57.160 --> 43:00.160]  federal hospitals there are gonna do an autopsy because they've done it with
[43:00.160 --> 43:03.080]  Ron Brown and a bullet in his head they got good people in the government they
[43:03.080 --> 43:07.080]  said Pat Tillman was murdered the Army Colonel that did the autopsy they don't
[43:07.080 --> 43:10.600]  there are a lot of good people in our government I gotta say I used to bash the
[43:10.600 --> 43:15.040]  government all day but a professional level at the military brass level and
[43:15.040 --> 43:18.840]  they're more informed and care more than the general public that's why I don't
[43:18.840 --> 43:22.800]  want to be enemies with the feds because a lot of them are some of the best
[43:22.800 --> 43:27.280]  people there are and they don't want the feds getting them they send him 300 plus
[43:27.280 --> 43:32.080]  miles to have his blood drained and then bomb him and then ship him back it was
[43:32.080 --> 43:43.120]  all done secretively should he die like Errol Flynn in the saddle or was he
[43:43.120 --> 43:50.000]  murdered it's a 99% chance either died in the saddle or was murdered now that's
[43:50.000 --> 43:54.520]  the criminology prime projection and I'm not bragging folks but I've proven it
[43:54.520 --> 43:58.080]  I know what I'm talking about notice I'm right in the middle of it I'm the one
[43:58.080 --> 44:01.840]  God infiltrate Bohemian Grove did it again told the history channel they were
[44:01.840 --> 44:06.680]  being set up history channel got arrested I didn't
[44:08.000 --> 44:13.440]  I'm not bragging I know what I'm talking about we come out we say it looks
[44:13.440 --> 44:17.360]  like it's a cultic we're investigating it looks like Bohemian Grove boom it is a
[44:17.360 --> 44:26.000]  Bohemian Grove satellite there is a cover-up there must be an investigation
[44:26.000 --> 44:28.920]  the question is who does it so we're proving right again just like I told
[44:28.920 --> 44:33.720]  you Saturday watch I bet there's not an autopsy what an autopsy the law flouted
[44:33.720 --> 44:37.480]  the law ignored what else do I have to be right about before people start
[44:37.480 --> 44:46.720]  listening to what we're saying this is a Braverian Illuminati cult it is the
[44:46.720 --> 44:51.080]  dominant cult in our government and I've explained this and the Nazis get so mad
[44:51.080 --> 44:55.000]  at me out there that's why they attacked me more than Benjamin Netanyahu you go
[44:55.000 --> 44:59.240]  to all the major Nazi sites I am the number one hated by the Nazis and the
[44:59.240 --> 45:02.400]  number one hated by the Southern Prairie Law Center and one of the top hated by
[45:02.400 --> 45:06.880]  the ADL why does the left-wing Jewish group hate me why does the foundation run
[45:06.880 --> 45:11.320]  offshore run Southern Prairie Law Center hate me why do the white
[45:11.320 --> 45:15.320]  supremacists hate me so much because they're all run by the same people to
[45:15.320 --> 45:19.440]  create a racist dialectic let me tell you when you get up to the highest levels
[45:19.440 --> 45:23.480]  of Hollywood or corporate world they're not worshiping the Talmud even if they're
[45:23.480 --> 45:28.000]  Jewish and a lot of them are Jewish they're not worshiping you know Jesus if
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.760]  they're Catholic they're not if they're Muslims they're not following Muhammad
[45:33.760 --> 45:38.800]  whether it's the Saudi royalty or whether it's the liberal elites or the
[45:38.800 --> 45:44.720]  royal family of England they are worshiping Lucifer the Morning Star
[45:44.720 --> 45:58.960]  he's the god of this world and so the Supreme Court justice at the key time
[45:58.960 --> 46:06.960]  died and they say he's an officer in the group in an Illuminati meeting now
[46:06.960 --> 46:09.840]  let's be clear
[46:09.840 --> 46:15.200]  Scalia did a lot of good things he did some bad things and most people in a
[46:15.200 --> 46:22.760]  pyramidal or compartmentalized cult structure do not get into the ninth
[46:22.760 --> 46:27.080]  circle you may have heard of that from Dante but they have six seven eight or
[46:27.080 --> 46:31.080]  nine circles then they have circles within the final circle of compartmentalization
[46:31.080 --> 46:42.160]  these are the original intelligence networks and so most people are inducted
[46:42.160 --> 46:46.360]  it hey it's a hunting lodge in fact they talk about the most moral you induct
[46:46.360 --> 46:50.960]  them into a hunting lodge or you induct them into they had Christian
[46:50.960 --> 46:54.120]  organizations that were fronts that we're gonna help the poor and that way you
[46:54.120 --> 46:57.040]  control everybody get their money have them under your control you can watch
[46:57.040 --> 47:01.840]  them the Illuminati papers talk about this Adam vice-ops but we must get all
[47:01.840 --> 47:07.360]  the moral men we must get the best people and so there's a very good chance
[47:07.360 --> 47:11.560]  Scalia was out there as part of just the corporate minutes of this hunting
[47:11.560 --> 47:17.880]  ancient society that was refounded by Bohemian Grove and that someone was
[47:17.880 --> 47:22.680]  brought in and he was taken out that's that's that's the prime analysis and
[47:22.680 --> 47:26.240]  and where it's all pointed right now there's a secondary chance that there
[47:26.240 --> 47:29.760]  was other hanky-panky going on other weirdness going on with other people so
[47:29.760 --> 47:32.520]  they didn't want an investigation when he had a heart attack and then it was
[47:32.520 --> 47:35.120]  natural that's a very small probability and then there's another
[47:35.120 --> 47:40.440]  probability that you know he was exercising himself in the bed will just
[47:40.440 --> 47:43.120]  leave it at that and you know obviously at his age 79 taking something to
[47:43.120 --> 47:46.960]  stimulate that that they warn you at that age don't take C. Alliser or or
[47:46.960 --> 47:52.080]  Viagra's and like you have a heart attack and die in some cases and that's
[47:52.080 --> 47:55.840]  that's the investigation for the FBI and everybody else which which I know you
[47:55.840 --> 47:59.320]  guys already know about all this but that's what's going on and are you gonna
[47:59.320 --> 48:02.960]  let a Supreme Court justice die inside an Illuminati compound with a black cop
[48:02.960 --> 48:06.560]  commander running the whole thing that hangs out with Obama at a key point I
[48:06.560 --> 48:10.080]  mean with no autopsy and the pillow on the face and all the rest of it and all
[48:10.080 --> 48:15.440]  the story changing dozens of times now and again there is an investigation you
[48:15.440 --> 48:19.920]  heard it from Larry Nichols that's why this is all coming out because they
[48:19.920 --> 48:23.920]  want to put it out how they're going to put it out first to control it and spin
[48:23.920 --> 48:29.760]  it. We come back even better news and I'm gonna do the next half hour on this
[48:29.760 --> 48:33.240]  and then get back into the Illuminati because you need to know what really
[48:33.240 --> 48:38.760]  governs you and and and what is trying to get full control. New York Times
[48:38.760 --> 48:42.640]  columnist jokes about assassinating a New York Times columnist jokes about
[48:42.640 --> 48:46.120]  assassination attempt ending Trump's campaign he says good news guys I've
[48:46.120 --> 48:50.920]  figured out how the Trump campaign ends and this wouldn't have been done by Ross
[48:50.920 --> 48:57.320]  do that if he hadn't been authorized you can bet your bottom biscuits sort of
[48:57.320 --> 49:02.040]  break that down coming up if you want dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove it's

[54:20.720 --> 54:42.320]  I was literally just out there writing an article with Kit Daniels working with
[54:42.320 --> 54:48.520]  him on it and Kit's a smart guy Paul Watson's a smart guy so if they don't
[54:48.520 --> 54:52.400]  completely understand what I'm saying I just said a voice memo for them so they
[54:52.400 --> 54:59.520]  can transcribe it I'm gonna do that again and then get into Trump this is the
[54:59.520 --> 55:04.800]  short condensed readers digest version of the Illuminati which you can even
[55:04.800 --> 55:09.480]  find in encyclopedia Britannica there was a major Renaissance world movement
[55:09.480 --> 55:16.040]  taking place in Europe and the colonies after 200 plus years of the building
[55:16.040 --> 55:20.120]  Renaissance that was unseating the Catholic Church and its monopolies as
[55:20.120 --> 55:29.400]  well as royalty across Europe as well as England and Scotland a Jesuit by
[55:29.400 --> 55:35.400]  training professor Adam Weissop at Ingolstadt University then developed
[55:35.400 --> 55:43.160]  his own counter populist movement that was not meant to overthrow the monarchies
[55:43.160 --> 55:51.560]  or overthrow the church but to actually overthrow the Renaissance in the name of
[55:51.560 --> 55:56.920]  overthrowing the royalty in the church to then establish a total world
[55:56.920 --> 56:02.040]  dictatorship that was Luciferian in nature
[56:05.560 --> 56:09.920]  George Washington in his famous letters against the Illuminati points all of
[56:09.920 --> 56:13.880]  this out and says that the French Revolution is super bad news and is
[56:13.880 --> 56:21.160]  meant to create total tyranny and that needs to be resisted so simply put it
[56:21.160 --> 56:29.160]  is a false political populist movement designed to basically say all the right
[56:29.160 --> 56:35.080]  things come in and take over the Renaissance take over civilization in
[56:35.080 --> 56:42.920]  society and establish tyranny when the police raided the Illuminati after one
[56:42.920 --> 56:46.880]  of their letter carriers was struck by lightning and they found whole dossiers
[56:46.880 --> 56:51.280]  going to France under countries in Italy on how to run these operations the
[56:51.280 --> 56:55.960]  Illuminati was broken up in Germany for a time it moved in 1832 to Yale with the
[56:55.960 --> 57:00.800]  Russell Trust giving it millions of dollars to establish the organization at
[57:00.800 --> 57:06.280]  Yale and to try to take the United States over sculling bones was founded
[57:06.280 --> 57:11.640]  sculling bones took over a popular hunting lodge north of San Francisco that
[57:11.640 --> 57:18.240]  Mark Twain was a part of they kicked them out close to 1900 and Howard Taft and
[57:18.240 --> 57:23.360]  others that were members of sculling bones went to Bohemian Grove and set it
[57:23.360 --> 57:28.040]  up as a party palace to induct other powerful men and robber barons and
[57:28.040 --> 57:35.200]  royalty to get them to join their death cult it has since set up satellite
[57:35.200 --> 57:39.920]  organizations across the United States and they now admit in the Washington
[57:39.920 --> 57:45.280]  Post that it was a satellite organization set up in the 60s reviving a
[57:45.280 --> 57:51.040]  particular order a hunting order that was a front then as well with Scalia as an
[57:51.040 --> 57:57.080]  officer in it and established a Bohemian Grove satellite in Texas and as we've
[57:57.080 --> 58:00.440]  told you there are other satellites around the country so that's what this
[58:00.440 --> 58:04.520]  is that's what's happening and when we say secret society it means a private
[58:04.520 --> 58:09.200]  intelligence network they have their own courts their own trials their own
[58:09.200 --> 58:14.060]  systems they copy the Masons but they are not the Masons they have taken the
[58:14.060 --> 58:18.960]  Masons over in many areas because it's compartmentalized and the porch Masons
[58:18.960 --> 58:23.120]  or the profane Masons don't know they're being given a different teaching than
[58:23.120 --> 58:28.960]  one of the more ancient Solomon-based or Egyptian-based Masonic systems but the
[58:28.960 --> 58:33.640]  real system that modified this and created the Renaissance would be the
[58:33.640 --> 58:39.160]  ancient Christian order stay with us we'll be back

[01:00:23.480 --> 01:00:28.920]  New York Times columnist jokes about assassination attempt endings Trump's
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:40.480]  campaign. Good guys news good news guys I figured out how the Trump campaign ends
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:48.840]  and our story is linked up on drudgereport.com at the top tonight
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:53.880]  cruise rubio fight over scraps we're gonna have live coverage and I'll be
[01:00:53.880 --> 01:01:01.720]  part of it as well with expanded info wars nightly news and our crew does such
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:07.720]  an amazing job breaking all this down and we come back in the next segment I'm
[01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:13.240]  going to read the article about the call for Trump's death and why this is so
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:16.720]  important Paul's doing other reports on and others doing reports on all the
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:25.680]  tweets out there. Supporting Trump being killed that's putting the idea out
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:29.640]  there so somebody tries it and then the media likens Trump to someone that'll
[01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:35.440]  hold a baby up in front of the reported shooter. We're gonna play video of that
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:42.760]  as well but that story is up on info wars.com
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:48.880]  There's also another report 45% of Americans paying no federal income tax
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:56.720]  they've done it that way so that for the middle class who pays 45% and the elite
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.640]  who basically exempt themselves well the elite are exempt the general
[01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:04.240]  public's exempt and so they said I'm going I want more I want socialism yeah
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:07.600]  I'm not paying for it that's only gonna happen till the globalist consolidate
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:12.720]  everything and condition everyone to be slaves so in Mitt Romney said 47% of
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:16.000]  people 48% people don't matter because they're already paid off they don't care
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:22.040]  that's true it's very very immoral they've been bought off and they want more
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:26.640]  now they want free tuition now they want free healthcare and of course they'll
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.440]  never get it we're going into the collapse in the next few years it's
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:34.720]  already here in most parts of the world but we're gonna go to break come back
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:40.040]  and really really burrow into this I mean I got so upset over Scalia being in a
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.520]  secret society and turning out it's the Illuminati I mean that's what it is on
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:47.720]  record I mean I've got books itself are like $800 a piece of the internal
[01:02:47.720 --> 01:02:51.880]  annals of Bohemian Grove widows mail them to me when their husbands die it's
[01:02:51.880 --> 01:02:56.600]  only like a thousand five hundred members and it's all we trace ourselves the
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.640]  Bavarian Illuminati blah blah and you know German chancellors like Helmut
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:06.400]  Schmidt have written books this is not my opinion oh look at the next headline
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:14.240]  babies made without men see how we're entering this world we're gonna get to
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.640]  all of it coming up today but but briefly because I only plugged once last
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:23.920]  hour and even skipped a break it is so important that people support GCN live
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:27.680]  calm and the sponsors that GCN has it doesn't mean I vet them all or I support
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:30.960]  them all because I have to be on the air with with other sponsors other ads that
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:37.840]  I have it vetted I'm just saying that and vice versa Ted gets to be on air with
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.400]  my sponsors which are pretty much just our products so I can control everything
[01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:45.440]  and try to have a hundred percent good mojo and just absolutely feel so good
[01:03:45.440 --> 01:03:49.160]  when I sell you something whether it's a water filtration system or non GMO seeds
[01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:54.920]  or a Hillary for prison shirt or nutraceuticals I mean I really want
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.120]  you to have the very best products so you keep buying them but I never was like
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.760]  that early on I really want people to have the best products because that's
[01:04:01.760 --> 01:04:04.240]  how I want to be treated but it turns out that works really good because folks
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:09.120]  that really keep buying see globalist do evil things not because even helps them
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:13.600]  but because they're evil in nature but I digress you really should try survival

[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:13.360]  information war continues it's alex jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:20.360 --> 01:08:25.640]  think about this so important it illustrates everything the president
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.960]  says trump is ineligible he's disqualified because the president is God
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:35.720]  and tells you what you can and can't have here in this free country they tell
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.440]  you trump is racist because he wants a border that every other country has they
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:44.320]  say he's evil and horrible because he doesn't want to bring jihadis in with
[01:08:44.320 --> 01:08:48.080]  undocumented refugees who don't even have their passports looked at that's on
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:53.600]  record the communist Chinese government came out last night and said do not
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:56.880]  elect Donald Trump because he says he won't let us keep lowering our currency
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:01.600]  which is a tariff against the US we don't have tariffs on them they have them
[01:09:01.600 --> 01:09:07.240]  on us he just says you can't screw us hundreds of container ships a week come
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.200]  in on the west coast there have been periods they've been I did a powerful
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:13.760]  piece on this last night
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:19.720]  where not one container ship goes between the United States and Europe and
[01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:24.640]  Russia in the Atlantic there are government websites that show the
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.360]  container ships going back and forth there are long periods now when nothing
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:34.640]  goes back and forth it's dead because China lowers prices lower standards has
[01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:38.480]  no environmental controls our government's pile them on us and then all
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:46.960]  trade goes to them and then we're checkmated we are unable to take care of
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:59.480]  ourselves now let's think about it the communist Chinese hating the socialist
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:05.440]  Pope hates him the Democrats hating foreign TV stations Univision hating the
[01:10:05.440 --> 01:10:09.680]  Republican Party says we can't have him the insider Bushes say we can't have
[01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:17.240]  him the Clintons say we can't have him Fox hates him CNN hates him MSNBC hates him
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.160]  the whole world system hates him the Federal Reserve has come out and doesn't
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:29.000]  like him because whatever they know about Donald Trump it scares the living
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:34.640]  daylights out of them and some people see wheels within wheels and they're
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:39.960]  certainly there and they say Donald Trump could be the ultimate fake populist
[01:10:39.960 --> 01:10:43.960]  and they are running him and letting him say all this knowing it'll make him get
[01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:48.800]  elected they've never behaved like that before they've never brought out the
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:52.240]  Federal Reserve should be audited they've never brought out 9-11 truth the 28
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:59.680]  pages they've never said we should control our borders both big parties what
[01:10:59.680 --> 01:11:05.520]  he's doing is changing the political landscape and basically blowing a hole
[01:11:05.520 --> 01:11:11.080]  in the side of their ship of lies so water pours in so truth comes in they're
[01:11:11.080 --> 01:11:15.480]  already sinking and they've already taken hundreds of millions of dollars away
[01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:21.280]  from him with his companies and TV shows and hotels they're already hurting him
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:32.560]  financially he's committed to this fight and if he ends up being a Benedict
[01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:38.400]  Arnold he will be the most hated person in US history and will be anathema
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:41.880]  because it's one thing to be a sleazy politician then get in and screw people
[01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:45.640]  over it's another thing to claim you are the mantle of the champion of
[01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:50.680]  populism and he's doing this with conservatives veterans libertarians and
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:55.000]  true Christians we're not dumb liberals who don't care as long as our cult
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:04.040]  leaders in Trump knows full well that it's over for him if he doesn't deliver
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:06.960]  and he knows his whole lives on the line he said I don't care about money I
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:11.280]  don't care about the future he said I'll basically have to retire if I don't
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:24.400]  win this he is completely and totally on the line and I've said over and over
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:28.600]  again and they now political scientists coming out saying he's got a 97% chance of
[01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:33.600]  winning he was 200 to one odds that he'd lose now the odds are he's gonna win in
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:40.560]  the top British bookmakers Vegas is now saying a shoe in and I said over and over
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:46.680]  again I believe that they will try to kill him if they can wind up a crazy like
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:50.040]  they did Reagan and pray for Donald Trump and they had all the White House
[01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:54.280]  run media matters groups and others come out and CNN and everybody and say
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:59.280]  Jones is crazy he says that they'll try to kill Trump oh there's never been
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:02.080]  political assassination when somebody goes up against the system in world
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:13.560]  history really it's like saying there's never been blue blue sky so they're
[01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:21.960]  scared and they're really scared of 45% in the exit polls of it people
[01:13:21.960 --> 01:13:31.300]  identifying as Hispanic voted for Donald Trump notice he won by 45.9 and the
[01:13:31.300 --> 01:13:36.280]  exit polls were almost 46 as well because they're just Americans like
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:42.800]  everybody else that are fed up and sick of it that's another big hoax like Gallup
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:46.800]  they've had two different polls 70 plus percent of Hispanic Americans don't want
[01:13:46.800 --> 01:13:50.680]  open borders really I wonder why maybe they know Mexico's a living hell in
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:55.800]  many areas beautiful country great people never got out from under colonialism
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:14:02.280]  well you think they got out from under it was Santa Anna a dictator there were
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:05.480]  more than 20 rebellions in Mexico against Santa and he was overthrown he
[01:14:05.480 --> 01:14:11.320]  lost Guatemala they claim it's racist that Texas succeeded a third of the
[01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:14.240]  people in the revolution were Hispanic the guy that wrote the Constitution
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:20.160]  Navarro was it five of the 14 founding fathers were Hispanic they wanted their
[01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.560]  own land they wanted their own property they wanted to be able to have guns did
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:27.400]  racial politics come in later and push Hispanics out of areas steal land from
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:34.120]  absolutely that's how gangs work and it's wrong but the point is they're
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:38.080]  lying about Trump when they're saying he wants to hurt Hispanics that's a load
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:44.480]  of baloney let me tell you you get rid of China's tariffs we'll have jobs here
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:50.080]  again in this country we got foreign governments the Pope the president all
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:56.200]  in one week it was last Thursday the Pope came out so it was China yesterday so
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:01.920]  in one week we've had the president the Pope and the Communist Chinese president
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:05.720]  come out and threaten the American people about Donald Trump I'm gonna tell
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:09.640]  the Communist Chinese that perch on top of billion three hundred million hard
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:12.600]  working people that you've enslaved and they don't even get wealth out of all
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:17.840]  the stuff you've done all the millions of little girl babies you've killed you
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:20.960]  don't tell us what to do and you stop trying to censor our TV in our movies
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:25.360]  and our print and Michael Sabbage's book you crawl right back in your mouth say
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:31.600]  tongue you know what hole and get out of my face trash your bloodsucking maggots
[01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:36.600]  and that goes for the Pope and Obama and everybody else you don't tell us who we
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:45.640]  can vote for you don't threaten us that's why it's gonna backfire with quote
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:49.240]  minorities Hispanics and blacks and others because they know they're getting
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:52.240]  the shaft we're all getting the shaft we're all under attack it's time to get
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:57.960]  past race all this garbage and it's time to get down to nationalism nationalism
[01:15:57.960 --> 01:16:03.560]  isn't perfect but it's a lot better than globalism globalism in Star Trek
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:08.200]  Coomba everybody loving each other globalism is global elites above the
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:15.960]  law tax exempt with jumbo jets full of sex slaves and I'm not gonna be part of
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:21.120]  it and I'm not gonna sell out to it either so the system needs to quit their
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:25.240]  overtures on a routine basis don't talk to your psychologist and people they've
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:30.360]  got they've assessed me they know I'm not selling out ever so you can stop

[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:48.280]  could end Donald Trump's presidential campaign good news guys I figured out how
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:54.080]  the Trump campaign ends he said and tweeted last night a video that I'm
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:59.520]  gonna air in the next segment and then I'm gonna air my bohemian grove Scalia
[01:17:59.520 --> 01:18:03.880]  peace and the segment after that with a roundtable discussion the tweet links to
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:09.160]  a video clip from the 1983 movie the dead zone which features a character
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:14.360]  played by Christopher Walken attempting to gun down a political figure played by
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:18.280]  Martin Sheen in the plot Walken's character tries to kill the US
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.760]  senatorial candidate played by Sheen because he has visions of him becoming
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:25.440]  president in the future and starting nuclear war she's character holds up his
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:28.760]  baby as a shield during the assassination attempt destroying his
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:32.160]  credibility while joking about the assassination attempt on any public
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:36.560]  figure is crass is particularly relevant that Trump has become and faces a very
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:42.240]  real threat of being targeted as we previously highlighted according to his
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:46.800]  former advisor he's not his former advisor he's a current advisor he's

[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:16.800]  vest in October of last year for reports that he would most wanted drug lord
[01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:20.360]  El Chapo had put a hundred million dollar bounty on his head he also received
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:23.520]  secret service protection around that time following his controversial
[01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:26.760]  comments on Muslim integration back in December Twitter exploded with death

[01:24:13.480 --> 01:24:19.880]  a former prosecutor and of course TV hosts and radio hosts Lionel will be
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:23.160]  joining us for a couple segments at the middle of the next hour at the bottom of
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:27.600]  the hour because he has questions about Scalia's death as a former prosecutor
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:32.360]  and as a defense lawyer and in other capacities I guess in state and federal
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:39.120]  government so he'll be joining us coming up to get into that but it's a
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:44.580]  pretty big deal when you know that Bohemian Grove was founded by Skull and
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:48.640]  Bones that was founded by the Illuminati on record I mean that's mainline history
[01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:56.840]  books there's a discovery channel shows about it that I am a guest on and they
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:00.960]  went and did research said no Mr. Jones is accurate and really nobody even put
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.480]  this stuff together because it's in this history book it's in that history book
[01:25:03.480 --> 01:25:08.040]  but it all connects together very neatly I mean it's it's it's open and shut
[01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:15.160]  and that this was a rovarian Illuminati death cult meeting and so they have to
[01:25:15.160 --> 01:25:22.160]  spin it that oh he died of natural causes and we're not supposed to question
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:27.000]  anything could this get any weirder we're gonna have a round-tip discussion about
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:31.200]  that coming up we'll open the phones up in the third hour on the death threat
[01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:35.040]  against Trump all the other news but David Knight ran in during the break and
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:38.200]  made a really great point brought me this article Hillary out of the inquisitor
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:43.080]  Hillary Clinton obituary hoax prompt secret service investigation that was
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:48.640]  just five days ago a Bernie Sanders supporters submitted Hillary Clinton's
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:52.560]  obituary to the Las Vegas Review Journal on Friday the campaign season has
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:55.440]  seen a number of political stunts but this might be the first to get the
[01:25:55.440 --> 01:25:58.880]  secret service involved they went investigated will there be an
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:04.160]  investigation of a major New York Times writer saying the answer to Donald
[01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:09.720]  Trump is him dying him being assassinated and then tweeting a YouTube
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:15.440]  link to this film it's an excellent film by the way with a Martin Sheen and
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.720]  Christopher Walken this is the dead zone where a guy's having visions of
[01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:23.080]  World War three caused by this guy he gets elected he goes to kill him but he
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:26.440]  holds up a baby in front of him on their head for radio listeners and so he
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.680]  doesn't have to kill him because it makes the guy look like a total coward so
[01:26:29.680 --> 01:26:33.320]  they're also saying that Trump would hold a baby up in front of him yeah I bet
[01:26:33.320 --> 01:26:36.840]  this writer doesn't have one millionth the courage Trump has to do what he's
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:40.880]  doing I love how coward always say that those of us in the public eye that have
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:46.160]  controversial views and fight the elite that we're cowards no you are a punk
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:51.120]  coward that called for Trump to be killed now let's go ahead and go to this clip
[01:26:51.120 --> 01:27:05.480]  from the dead zone
[01:27:14.360 --> 01:27:18.600]  you know that's weird no Martin Sheen so well
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:22.840]  Martin Sheen back when I had to bash Bush was a huge fan
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:27.400]  I'm not name-dropping it's just weird but after I went after Obama I still had dinner
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:30.480]  with him a few times and everything and he kind of halfway forgave me for not
[01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:34.280]  liking Obama and said August you're right later on but he's a really good
[01:27:34.280 --> 01:27:38.960]  guy he means well people attacking but he's got a good heart
[01:27:38.960 --> 01:27:50.280]  of the tremendous part you're giving this campaign you made this campaign the most talked about the most exciting the most important campaign we've also had Christopher Walken on
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:55.360]  and I've come here personally to thank you for that he's a listener too but won't talk politics
[01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:58.920]  it's just weird this is the people that are listeners Christopher Walken you
[01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:03.120]  name it people didn't believe it till he showed up on the show once all right
[01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:16.640]  Walken's about trying to shoot him
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:20.480]  he won't shoot because he's holding the baby in front of him
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:32.760]  the secret service shooting with a two inch barrel gun in the hand and in the
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:40.200]  chest perfectly from 50 yards away pretty much impossible but there you go if
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:42.720]  you're a TV viewer you just saw that radio listeners on there edited it
[01:28:42.720 --> 01:28:49.000]  obviously but that's the kind of crud being put out and they are trying to
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:53.680]  encourage people to kill Trump they celebrate it when Scalia died and I
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:28:57.000]  just hope the Trump doesn't fall down have a magic heart attack or doesn't you
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.920]  know get found the pillow over his face and the media will be like hell dare
[01:28:59.920 --> 01:29:03.520]  Jones say there was no autopsy in a pillow over his face at a black op
[01:29:03.520 --> 01:29:07.680]  commander's house and they drove the body 300 plus miles secretly and then he had
[01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.120]  two private jets there but didn't fly him out but he flew in on it yeah it was a
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:15.400]  secret society connected the Illuminati big deal so he's had a secret compound
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:19.120]  with devil art and human sacrifice stuff everywhere you know with a known
[01:29:19.120 --> 01:29:24.640]  satanic organization and he's dead a key Supreme Court person I mean whoa whoa
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:31.080]  this crazy guy was asking questions I mean whoa man
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:35.520]  meanwhile the Chinese government says do not elect Trump or we will do bad
[01:29:35.520 --> 01:29:40.600]  things to you go to hell China but I guess we've been maneuvered to the point
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:45.960]  where we are little minions of the Communist murdering chai-kong pigs
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:51.560]  we're on the March got a special report coming up special report on the
[01:29:51.560 --> 01:29:56.840]  Illuminati and then roundtable discussion stay with us
[01:30:00.080 --> 01:30:05.920]  Marco Rubio Wall Street's boy toy he's gotten more money from the elite donors
[01:30:05.920 --> 01:30:09.920]  and Wall Street than number two Jeb or even number three Hillary after
[01:30:09.920 --> 01:30:15.400]  blowing 150 million dollars on Jeb they still haven't learned anything Jeb's
[01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:19.840]  dropping out didn't help Rubio in Nevada Rubio is the establishment's 20%
[01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:23.640]  solution Jeb had a sense of entitlement kind of like the donor class and the
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:27.360]  party elite that support Rubio they believe they can openly oppose the
[01:30:27.360 --> 01:30:31.880]  voters on their key issues and still win but Rubio is a little smarter he
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:35.680]  realizes that his support for illegal immigration with a gang of eight was a
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:39.120]  betrayal of the voters but he still thinks they're too stupid to see through
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:43.160]  the lives it's called Breitbart a conspiracy website and the president of
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:47.360]  the ice Union a liar when they exposed Rubio's betrayal with the gang of eight
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:52.120]  the Rubio's campaign will provide a useful public service identifying the
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:55.600]  GOP political class who will say anything to get elected

[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:11.920]  warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense 60 years
[01:32:11.920 --> 01:32:16.880]  ago when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs they
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:22.000]  had drums of their own air raid sirens but in the 21st century there are
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.960]  silent weapons for quiet war pathogens added to the food and water into the
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:31.360]  lining of plastics that destroy our vitality turn off our hormones and
[01:32:31.360 --> 01:32:36.320]  accelerate our journey towards death I personally counter this onslaught with

[01:33:14.720 --> 01:33:32.360]  listening to alex jones
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:37.480]  jennings bring this in the summer of rage all right we're gonna play a five
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:41.640]  minute special report that some clips from dark secrets inside bohemian grove
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:45.800]  in the order of death the two films I've made on bohemian grove the Illuminati
[01:33:45.800 --> 01:33:51.160]  satellite base from Bavaria Germany in their own animals infiltrated and got
[01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:55.200]  them obviously and now they admit the wash them post he had died during a
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:34:00.200]  secret ritual meeting of a bohemian grove founded spinoff that he's also a
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:05.200]  member of so now this goes from being suspicious to absolutely there must be a
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:09.640]  criminal investigation I mean this is ridiculous it'd be like if you saw some
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.600]  crazy guy grab a kid out of a backyard and throw him in a van and they go we're
[01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.840]  not gonna investigate where the kid went I mean it's now reached that
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:21.120]  redonkulous level we're gonna play this report and we're gonna go to David Knight
[01:34:21.120 --> 01:34:24.520]  who was down there with the team the occultic photos the videos we got
[01:34:24.520 --> 01:34:31.480]  dozens of devil masks children being ripped apart just craziness inside the
[01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:38.440]  ranch riskily you died then we're going to talk to Kit Daniels as well and Joe
[01:34:38.440 --> 01:34:40.800]  Biggs and I want to get your car involved because I know he wasn't part of the
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:45.240]  team that went down there he was working on a bunch of other stories but I want
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:48.160]  to get his take on this I know he's a Christian I want to get his view on who
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:51.080]  would have thought that now it's again bohemian grove that I'm an expert on
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:57.160]  that we're an expert on and then now we were experts on Scalia's death and then
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:35:00.680]  now it ties back into that I mean it's just all interconnected folks I didn't
[01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:04.280]  used to believe in all this stuff before I got involved on radio I was a mainline
[01:35:04.280 --> 01:35:08.680]  libertarian Ron Paul type guy and then it just got weirder and weirder because I
[01:35:08.680 --> 01:35:14.920]  became somebody that sources came to and it just from there the rabbit hole
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:18.480]  opened up so we're gonna get to that in a moment before I go any further though

[01:37:58.680 --> 01:38:03.240]  the Bohemian Grove itself that again is an admitted spinoff in their own
[01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:08.080]  writings of skull and bones and admitted spinoff of the Bavarian order of the
[01:38:08.080 --> 01:38:13.160]  Illuminati that was the false revolution meant to destroy the Renaissance led by
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:18.760]  Christians led by good Masonic orders and led by the Rosicrucians mainly Sir
[01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:22.400]  Francis Bacon and others and it was a Jesuit run you could say it wasn't
[01:38:22.400 --> 01:38:28.200]  Catholic but it was Jesuit false revolution to smash the true enlightenment
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:32.440]  and it's it failed for a long time but now it's getting full planetary control
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:37.120]  the Pope has uncloaked himself as a pure agent of Lucifer in my view and is now
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:44.480]  attacking the family life borders sovereignty nationalism manhood the
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:47.800]  communist Chinese who we know are pure agents of the devil are attacking
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:52.160]  Trump and yours truly and Michael Savage and everybody else this is the full
[01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:55.120]  attempt to bring down America you're witnessing right now the enemy's full
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:58.960]  force combining now to shatter the republic and who would have ever
[01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:03.320]  thought Donald Trump would rise up as the populist resist it now if he isn't
[01:39:03.320 --> 01:39:06.960]  that man that's really trying to resist it he'll be anathema well let's go to this
[01:39:06.960 --> 01:39:11.400]  report and come back and shift years into Scalia found dead at a satellite base
[01:39:11.400 --> 01:39:17.280]  of the Bohemian Grove Braverian Illuminati our story begins in northern
[01:39:17.280 --> 01:39:23.080]  California over a hundred years ago when locals began to spread rumors of
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:28.560]  bizarre occult rituals being conducted in the ancient redwood groves of Sonoma
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:34.360]  County as the decades passed it became clear these incredible stories had a
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:40.880]  basis in truth and their source was a 2,700 acre private club known as the
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:45.800]  Bohemian Grove then in a time period between the mid 1970s and the early
[01:39:45.800 --> 01:39:52.600]  1990s scores of reporters attempted to infiltrate the Grove all attempts were
[01:39:52.600 --> 01:39:57.840]  unsuccessful Grove security identified them threw them out for trespassing or
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:40:02.320]  in some cases had the local police arrest them to many it seemed the Grove
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:08.880]  secrets would never become public all of that changed on July 15th 2000 when we
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:14.080]  ripped aside the veil of secrecy and were successfully able to penetrate the
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:19.120]  Bohemian Grove on their high holy day and videotape the cremation of care
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:34.380]  ritual
[01:40:49.120 --> 01:41:17.280]  Now, yeah, this is all done with pageantry, but religion was always set up as pageantry.
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:21.280]  It was the first theater. Now they're about to do the Mach Human Sacrifice.
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:26.280]  And this is only a small part of the hour-long ritual that's in dark secrets inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:32.280]  And again, it was shot on a primitive digital camera in a bag in the midst.
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:38.280]  Secret service watching me, so it's not that good.
[01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:49.280]  Begone, don't care. Fire shall have its will indeed. Begone, don't care. And all the wind make battery with our ducks.
[01:41:49.280 --> 01:41:58.280]  Hail fellowship's eternal flame. Once again, Midsummer sets us free.
[01:41:58.280 --> 01:42:09.280]  Now again, that's a Faustian deal of getting rid of their conscience and putting an all on the effigy of a child they're burning, who they bring in on a hearse.
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:12.280]  Drawn by...
[01:42:12.280 --> 01:42:19.280]  Now there you see the funeral pyre burning with the effigy of a human, or it could be real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:24.280]  There's been a lot of strange going on in that area of Northern California.
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:29.280]  But this is what the establishment is into right here in America.
[01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:34.280]  Where did this dark thinking start? This black spirituality.
[01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:40.280]  The central thread goes back to ancient Egypt and Babylon with the mystery schools.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:52.280]  They knew that knowledge is power, and so secret societies were formed to guard the secrets of medicine, architecture, government, agriculture.
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:59.280]  Secret societies are nothing more than the first intelligence agencies.
[01:42:59.280 --> 01:43:10.280]  Knowledge had to be guarded, but over time elites abused their control of the knowledge and used it to dominate their populations.
[01:43:10.280 --> 01:43:16.280]  And the same sciences of control are being used today.
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:22.280]  That's why the elite today relishes secrecy. They know that it is the fount of their power.
[01:43:22.280 --> 01:43:34.280]  They seek to dumb down the population, not just to hoard their secret knowledge to make us even more mindless, more domesticated, like braying sheep to the slaughter.
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:47.280]  Their religion is the science of sophistry, the science of the con artists, the science of the despot, the dictator, the tyrant, the controller, the charlatan, the liar.
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:56.280]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy. They are parasites. They are anathema to free dynamic human societies.
[01:43:56.280 --> 01:44:13.280]  Know your enemy, stand up for love and life and family, and resist the new world order, and the Babylonian slave state our enemies are attempting to construct.
[01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:23.280]  And the last time I was there three years ago, four years ago with History Channel, they were shooting it in this local theater that had all this bizarre satanic stuff all over the walls, you name it.
[01:44:23.280 --> 01:44:27.280]  That guy, the main director, was wearing a hat that said CIA on it.
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:35.280]  And the bartender behind the bar, because they had catering and food for the crew, was a Brad Metzler show, big budget.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:41.280]  The guy behind the counter goes, I'm friends with the Bushes, and he goes, I think you're the government coming here and saying we're doing rituals there.
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:46.280]  And I said, I know most of you aren't doing bad. I know it's just a big party doing duck people into deeper groups.
[01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:53.280]  And he said, uh-huh, so you guys are going to sneak in there today, and I went, whoa, and I went and told them, I said, that guy's calling them to tell them we're going to be there, and they're, oh, that's ridiculous.
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:45:05.280]  When we get there and they get arrested and I get away, and I jump in the river and literally swim away, they're like fools ran back to the police, and they made them make the whole piece positive or wouldn't let them out of jail.
[01:45:05.280 --> 01:45:14.280]  I mean, that's the kind of stuff goes on here, and of course, Metzler's friends with Bush, so it's probably, we can put two of them together, and Metzler's been on the show before, but this group founded by the Sculling Bones,
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:30.280]  it's self-founded by the Illuminati. This is a German death cult. I'm not saying Germans run everything. I'm saying, I study the elite, and they're not doing in the Jewish mafia or the Italian mafia or these different Illuminati groups.
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:40.280]  And I've talked to high-level folks. They are German death cults. And I've talked to high-level, high-level people, and they go, no, you're right. At the highest level, it's a weird German death cult. It's Faustian.
[01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:55.280]  And then Scalia is part of this in one of the spinoff groups. They admit that in the Washington Post. Justice Scalia spent his last hours with members of the Secret of Society of Elite Hunters, but that was, quote, founded as an outreach by Bohemian Grove in 1960.
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:46:05.280]  They say in the article, because Hitler had exterminated the group because they wouldn't join him. And that's actually true.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:17.280]  Hermann Göring was going to be the head of it. They said, no, so they killed him. And that just shows the power of secret societies. And I remember reading books about the Nazis taking down all the secret societies because they wouldn't join them.
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:29.280]  So, again, we're not saying they're Nazis either. We're not saying Scalia was involved in Satanism. This is how they get people to join, either for sex or either for, quote, hidden knowledge or for to be in a hunting club.
[01:46:29.280 --> 01:46:37.280]  That's, and then the Illuminati papers written by Wysop that are public and that are admitted to be his, they talk about how they get the best men to join them.
[01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:45.280]  We're going to go to the next hour. Everybody had plenty of time on this. We'll also cover Trump and the death threats from the New York Times. But who wants to go first here?
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:56.280]  Well, Alex, you know, we were there. We were talking about the issue as why are they meeting in secret? Why do we not know any of the 36 people that were there except for Scalia and Poindexter at the time?
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:47:18.280]  Total red flag from the beginning. Exactly. When the Sheriff's report came out, we got another person's name. And so, Alan Foster, as the Washington Post did this report and they talked to Poindexter, he says, there's nothing I can add to your observation that among my many guests at Sabolo Creek Ranch over the years, some members of the International Order of St. Hubertus have been numbered.
[01:47:18.280 --> 01:47:35.280]  Weird way to talk. He all talked cryptic because he does a total, total. And then he says, I'm aware of no connection between that organization and Justice Scalia as if he doesn't belong to the organization. He's one of the leaders of the organization, as is the friend of Scalia who traveled there, Alan Foster.
[01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:48.280]  And then as you go through and look at the people. In a room surrounded by devil mask and children being ripped limb from limb, we're going to roll the video over to this right now. He dies mysteriously. There's no autopsy, pillow over the head, story changes over and over again, key justice.
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:48:03.280]  And we're not supposed to ask questions. Keep going. Let's just be more sensational. Right, right. Poindexter says, I'm not aware that there's any connection between Scalia and that group. And yet, Poindexter, Scalia's friend, the two guys who had planes that flew in there on the 12th, flew out on the 14th.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:12.280]  Poindexter earlier in statements. Remember, we've got him said, I had never knew him before. I didn't know him. Yeah. Now he's in a super secret group with him. Right, right. There's no officers in it.
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:23.280]  We know four people's names who were there besides Scalia. All four of them are or were former leaders of the organization. So, you know, and we don't know the rest of the people who are there.
[01:48:23.280 --> 01:48:34.280]  But that's amazing. We look at that footage of that artwork that we were talking the other day and we talked about how, as we would eat, there were all these masks, double mask, looking down.
[01:48:34.280 --> 01:48:45.280]  We're all remarking about how creepy that was. Joe took a selfie of the mask up behind him. And then he said it looks like Bohemian Grove 2.0. Yeah, yeah. He called it. Joe Big called it.
[01:48:45.280 --> 01:48:53.280]  And we said it's really kind of Bohemian sagebrush. It was kind of our joke about it, you know, kind of a cross between Bohemian Grove and the shining is the way the place felt.
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:49:08.280]  But as we were, as I was sitting there texting my wife while the other guys were basically on air, I look over my shoulder and I see this amazing sculpture that has got devils and ripping people apart with sacrifice.
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:17.280]  Ripping children apart. Yeah, exactly. And this is not the kind of day of the dead artwork that you see from Mexico. I see that all the time. That's where everybody's dressed up. They got skeletons.
[01:49:17.280 --> 01:49:27.280]  No, this was Santa Ria Voodoo. Yeah, they have the day of the dead. They have the stylized. This wasn't light Santa Ria, by the way. This is black magic stuff. I mean, I know it.
[01:49:27.280 --> 01:49:30.280]  Yeah, yeah. So yeah, it's coming up in that clip there that we've got rolling.
[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:39.280]  I started making a study of the occult. Like I said, I mean, it's bizarre because I lived in the richest county in Texas and there were always rich people. My dad was just a dentist. I was middle class.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:46.280]  And, you know, I was a good looking guy all the rest of it, and aggressive and wore heavy metal shirts and gotten fights. And I guess they thought I was one of their fellow travelers.
[01:49:46.280 --> 01:49:53.280]  And they just three times tried to recruit me into, I mean, high level satanic stuff. And of course, I never would be part of it. And then they really got upset with me.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:58.280]  But folks need to know this is going on like a movie. And we're showing it on screen right now for TV viewers.
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:04.280]  Yeah, it's pretty amazing. And like I said, that is not anything at all like the day of the dead artwork.
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:15.280]  Furthermore, the Washington Post went back 10 years to an article that they had about this one individual, Alan Foster, who was the close friend of Scalia, who traveled with him, they say.
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:23.280]  And he took 40 of his friends to Czech Republic. They had things like a masked costume ball.
[01:50:23.280 --> 01:50:32.280]  Yeah, that's Bohemia. The Czech Republic was at the old heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. That's why they call it Oh, Al of Bohemia. It's not really an owl.
[01:50:32.280 --> 01:50:41.280]  And then you everything's always hidden for initiatives. You don't learn what it is to get deeper into it. These are just basically outer pools where they vet you into the deeper areas.
[01:50:41.280 --> 01:50:49.280]  So when we come back, Leanne, I want to get your take on this and then Joe Biggs and also Kit are in the other war room and the situation room.

[01:53:54.280 --> 01:54:16.280]  We are back. I'm Alan Jones, your host. We have the full crew in here of reporters. Many of them went down to this bizarro 30,000-acre ranch with occultism, children being torn limb from limb by demons, just devil mask everywhere, just over-the-top stuff.
[01:54:16.280 --> 01:54:25.280]  Some of those aren't sanorrhea. Some of those are voodoo masks, by the way. So that's why Nico has family down there and said three weeks ago, I don't like going down there, you know, all the voodoo.
[01:54:25.280 --> 01:54:28.280]  And all the dead bodies that have been found right over the border of that ranch.
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:30.280]  They do autopsies on them, too.
[01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:32.280]  They do autopsies. There are sacrifice many of them.
[01:54:32.280 --> 01:54:35.280]  He has a hearse company, right?
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:43.280]  So you can't make this up. We're going to be going to Joe Biggs and Kit and Jakar right into the next hour talking about all this.
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:49.280]  I remember Joe Biggs saying, it's like the shining. This place is creepy. You said that. Everybody was freaked out, wanted to get out of there.
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:55.280]  Who knows what's going on in there? Because you pick up on those vibes, like in Auschwitz or wherever, or in the Roman Coliseum.
[01:54:55.280 --> 01:54:59.280]  Leanne, what do you think about this? I mean, you are excited about this like I am.
[01:54:59.280 --> 01:55:05.280]  I got so freaked out when I read your tweet to me or your text messages from late last night in Joe's.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:11.280]  I was like, what? It was Bohemian Grove? What? Because it just all, I was like, again, the devil worshipers?
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:13.280]  I mean, it's just so real.
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:19.280]  Well, I mean, for me, it was just kind of confirmation because this is, I had already been feeling this way. I know Wayne Madsen and I.
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:21.280]  You were saying, I bet it's Bohemian Grove.
[01:55:21.280 --> 01:55:30.280]  Yeah. Well, it just, you get that sense and the fact that it was covered up so quickly and the guy point extra comes out right away and says, you know, it was a tragic.
[01:55:30.280 --> 01:55:39.280]  It was a great loss. Having made that statement, if it was his time to go, he was surrounded by friends in fairly nice setting with a full tummy, too.
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:44.280]  It's all written like a book. It's all scripted. The whole thing was scripted.
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.280]  Wayne was laughing about that as well. It was good to have them numbered among us.
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:50.280]  Wayne Madsen was laughing about that.
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:53.280]  What grown man talks about another grown man's tummy?
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:55.280]  A high priest.
[01:55:55.280 --> 01:56:01.280]  It was creepy to me. Immediately creepy and then how he talked about the bed clothes were unwrinkled and, you know, it just.
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:05.280]  He was very comfortable with a pillow over his head and Luke O'Brock's he sleeps with the fishes.
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:11.280]  You could tell that his close friends that he was with were wanting to really conceal everything that happened.
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:18.280]  They didn't talk about the two jets waiting that could have flown him, you know, in 30 minutes to Dallas, 30 minutes to San Antonio.
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:23.280]  He just so happens to have a friend in El Paso that runs a more.
[01:56:23.280 --> 01:56:25.280]  It was all so perfectly prepared.
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:26.280]  Yes.
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:29.280]  And here's Scalia, a big hunter, gets into this group.
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:36.280]  Again, they have spinoffs. That's what alumni talks about in the Weissau papers. Spinoffs to get the best men to be in your order, but they don't know.
[01:56:36.280 --> 01:56:42.280]  Right. Well, and I actually used to date a guy. He was in the Air Force and he joined the Masons and that's what he was talking about.
[01:56:42.280 --> 01:56:46.280]  I was like, no, they're great, wonderful people and Christian and we do all these things.
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:49.280]  And I was like, yeah, but what degree are you and just keep watching.
[01:56:49.280 --> 01:56:53.280]  Well, I'm not defending the Masons, but I've done deep research and I've looked at it.
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:56.280]  A lot of my ancestors were very high level Masons and founded Texas.
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.280]  These were incredibly godly men, totally ready to sacrifice their lives for God.
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:09.280]  They use the whole ancient Masonic order as a vehicle for their organization, but it has been taken over by black magic practitioners to a great extent.
[01:57:09.280 --> 01:57:17.280]  So it's true that a lot of the Masonic halls are actually Satanist halls now, but that's that's like a federal, federal or crab will move into somebody else's shell.
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:23.280]  The original Masons under the Christian orders were pretty much really good people.
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:26.280]  But before that, it was black and white magic from Egypt.
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:29.280]  Right. Well, it's definitely as the higher up you go, there is power there.
[01:57:29.280 --> 01:57:33.280]  So, I mean, you could use it either way, which is, you know, kind of scary.
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:39.280]  This whole scenario reminds me of the Da Vinci Code and just how there's like these secret societies and they're trying to hold these secrets.
[01:57:39.280 --> 01:57:41.280]  But, you know, we're just an order.
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.280]  Yeah. What is the headline for Watson?
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:48.280]  Scalia died in real life Da Vinci Code, Satanic Temple?
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:57:50.280]  Because that's what that place is. I mean, I looked at it.
[01:57:50.280 --> 01:57:57.280]  He had no connection to anybody though. It just so happens that the other only four other people whose names we know were leaders of the organization.
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:59.280]  Yeah, this is from the Houston Chronicle.
[01:57:59.280 --> 01:58:06.280]  I mean, he went to a secret society event in 2011 where they're talking about Houstonians joined the order of St. Hubertus.
[01:58:06.280 --> 01:58:16.280]  And then it talks about how the Southwest Priory, which is Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, New Mexico is the largest member chapter according to its leader, John Poindexter.
[01:58:16.280 --> 01:58:18.280]  Well, here's what's sad. The general public doesn't know.
[01:58:18.280 --> 01:58:22.280]  Secret societies are nothing but ancient intelligence agencies.
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:27.280]  So these are the top, the tops of intelligence agencies are secret societies.
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:31.280]  And if you're not genetically related to previous groups, they don't even let you in.
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:34.280]  That's why people say, I'm part of these groups? No, no, no.
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:38.280]  They've tried to recruit me to these groups because I'm genetically part of them.
[01:58:38.280 --> 01:58:42.280]  We'll be back. Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen, and we're here to break this system wide open.
[01:58:42.280 --> 01:58:49.280]  Third hour straight ahead.

[03:16:35.280 --> 03:17:03.280]  We're going to have a live stream of the show.
[03:17:03.280 --> 03:17:09.280]  We're also going to have some big Donald Trump news as well coming up at infowars.com.
[03:17:09.280 --> 03:17:11.280]  Now back to info wars nightly news.
[03:17:11.280 --> 03:17:13.280]  That's right.
[03:17:13.280 --> 03:17:14.280]  That's from Alex Jones.
[03:17:14.280 --> 03:17:15.280]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:17:15.280 --> 03:17:19.280]  It is the fourth hour of Overdrive of the Alex Jones show.
[03:17:19.280 --> 03:17:25.280]  Alex is going to pop in actually here in a little bit and do some live coverage with Facebook mentions.
[03:17:25.280 --> 03:17:37.280]  And we're also going to cover a bunch of interesting news.
[03:17:37.280 --> 03:17:40.280]  We're going to talk a little bit about what's coming up in the debate tonight.
[03:17:40.280 --> 03:17:44.280]  There's live coverage on infowars.com as well at 7 p.m.
[03:17:44.280 --> 03:17:56.280]  There is the question now, are Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz going to completely try to eviscerate Trump and use everything in his background ever to attack him with the hopes of climbing up the ranks?
[03:17:56.280 --> 03:18:00.280]  Or do they have a solidified position as second?
[03:18:00.280 --> 03:18:09.280]  And are they going to try and fight for the second place in hopes that Donald Trump may someday crash and burn if he goes up against Hillary Clinton?
[03:18:09.280 --> 03:18:12.280]  We'll see what goes on with that and I'll give you some insights on that.
[03:18:12.280 --> 03:18:14.280]  We've got some other interesting news.
[03:18:14.280 --> 03:18:17.280]  European Parliament calls for Saudi arms embargo.
[03:18:17.280 --> 03:18:23.280]  And the robots that are coming for jobs that pay $20 an hour or less, the White House finds.
[03:18:23.280 --> 03:18:32.280]  And then another rebuttal to that, technology, according to The Guardian, has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data.
[03:18:32.280 --> 03:18:33.280]  So we're going to talk about that.
[03:18:33.280 --> 03:18:36.280]  We've also got a special report on the rise of the robots.
[03:18:36.280 --> 03:18:39.280]  So we talk a lot about robots and what's going to actually happen.
[03:18:39.280 --> 03:19:00.280]  And spying and the NSA is so bad that Italy is asking the US to explain their NSA spying report as Brazil is building a $250 million underwater cable to Europe to be supported by Google and Facebook in order to get rid of espionage attempts by the United States.
[03:19:00.280 --> 03:19:09.280]  So that's where we're at. Other countries are now spending $250 million to build underwater cables so that they can avoid United States espionage.
[03:19:09.280 --> 03:19:13.280]  Also got the declaration of no selfie zones and a lot more.
[03:19:13.280 --> 03:19:14.280]  So we're going to cover that.
[03:19:14.280 --> 03:19:16.280]  And Alex is coming up live again on the show.
[03:19:16.280 --> 03:19:19.280]  He's going to be on Facebook mentions on his official Facebook page.
[03:19:19.280 --> 03:19:20.280]  So check that out as well.
[03:19:20.280 --> 03:19:23.280]  We're going to talk about the debate and so much more.
[03:19:23.280 --> 03:19:30.280]  I'm going to ask if something very, very special that I'm going to talk about is going to happen to Marco Rubio tonight.
[03:19:30.280 --> 03:19:35.280]  If his robotic systems are going to have a meltdown.
[03:19:35.280 --> 03:19:37.280]  So we'll talk about that when we come back as well.
[03:19:37.280 --> 03:19:40.280]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones show.
[03:19:40.280 --> 03:19:41.280]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:19:41.280 --> 03:19:42.280]  We are live.
[03:19:42.280 --> 03:20:03.280]  In the next segment, I'm just a sweet old lady who needs help crossing the street.
[03:20:03.280 --> 03:20:09.280]  But the real reason I want to get to the other side is so I can steal your identity along the way.
[03:20:09.280 --> 03:20:16.280]  While you're holding onto my hand, the RFID reader in my purse is capturing all your personal information.
[03:20:16.280 --> 03:20:20.280]  Debit cards, credit cards, even your work ID badge isn't safe.
[03:20:20.280 --> 03:20:23.280]  Oh, you have an RFID chipped subway pass.
[03:20:23.280 --> 03:20:26.280]  Well now, so do I.
[03:20:26.280 --> 03:20:31.280]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID stronghold wallets, card slaves and purses.
[03:20:31.280 --> 03:20:37.280]  ID stronghold pioneered RFID blocking technology over 10 years ago to prevent electronic pickpocketing.
[03:20:37.280 --> 03:20:39.280]  While it is open, imitators don't do that.
[03:20:39.280 --> 03:20:44.280]  ID stronghold wallets even cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.
[03:20:44.280 --> 03:20:48.280]  Visit idstronghold.com and get the original RFID blocking wallet.
[03:20:48.280 --> 03:20:49.280]  I'm Wal Augustino.
[03:20:49.280 --> 03:20:50.280]  It's founder and CEO.
[03:20:50.280 --> 03:21:08.280]  Protect yourself from crimes you can't see with ID stronghold.
[03:21:20.280 --> 03:21:24.280]  Milk thistle, fulvic acid, orange peel, zeolites and others.
[03:21:24.280 --> 03:21:26.280]  Deep cleanse doesn't hold back.
[03:21:26.280 --> 03:21:35.280]  Instead of buying five, six or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades old scientific research to put together the Rolls Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[03:21:35.280 --> 03:21:42.280]  Look, there's a reason deep cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary SPI Jurex herbal processing technique.
[03:21:42.280 --> 03:21:48.280]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research and we still bring it to you at the best price out there.
[03:21:48.280 --> 03:21:53.280]  If you wish to find deep cleanse and experience the all-in-one cleansing, visit infowarslife.com.
[03:21:53.280 --> 03:22:19.280]  That's infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:30.280]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[03:22:30.280 --> 03:22:34.280]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St. Croix River.
[03:22:34.280 --> 03:22:35.280]  I loved my dad.
[03:22:35.280 --> 03:22:36.280]  But boy was he stubborn.
[03:22:36.280 --> 03:22:39.280]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[03:22:39.280 --> 03:22:40.280]  His excuse?
[03:22:40.280 --> 03:22:41.280]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[03:22:41.280 --> 03:22:43.280]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[03:22:43.280 --> 03:22:49.280]  At less than $107 per month, Libertyoncall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[03:22:49.280 --> 03:22:50.280]  Don't wait.
[03:22:50.280 --> 03:22:55.280]  Go to libertyoncall.org right now for not just your sake, but for the sake of your loved ones.
[03:22:55.280 --> 03:22:58.280]  Again, that's libertyoncall.org.
[03:22:58.280 --> 03:23:00.280]  Are you tired of the cold this winter?
[03:23:00.280 --> 03:23:03.280]  Are you prepared for the next blizzard or snowstorm?
[03:23:03.280 --> 03:23:05.280]  What will you do when the power and heat go off?
[03:23:05.280 --> 03:23:07.280]  That could be our future.
[03:23:07.280 --> 03:23:14.280]  Fortress clothing's bug out bag with our head to toe solution is your one step answer to survival in the cold.

[03:24:07.280 --> 03:24:08.280]  Welcome back.
[03:24:08.280 --> 03:24:10.280]  It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:10.280 --> 03:24:13.280]  Anthony Gucciardi will be with you for the rest of the hour.
[03:24:13.280 --> 03:24:17.280]  And next segment, Alex Jones is going to come in with a live Facebook mention.
[03:24:17.280 --> 03:24:21.280]  So we're going to talk about a number of different things, including the debate tonight.
[03:24:21.280 --> 03:24:30.280]  And if you've been following the news, the new narrative is that Rubio and Ted Cruz are going to try and attack Donald Trump.
[03:24:30.280 --> 03:24:34.280]  Politico says Cruz Rubio prepped for brutal debate night.
[03:24:34.280 --> 03:24:40.280]  In final show before Super Tuesday, the senators are poised to unleash a nasty assault and emerge the anti-Trump.
[03:24:40.280 --> 03:24:44.280]  For Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, this might be their last best chance.
[03:24:44.280 --> 03:24:51.280]  The final Republican debate Thursday night before the Super Tuesday contest has the potential to be an epic display of anger and rhetorical aggression,
[03:24:51.280 --> 03:24:55.280]  with Rubio and Cruz going after each one on everything from policy to character,
[03:24:55.280 --> 03:24:59.280]  as each struggles to emerge as the single alternative to Donald Trump.
[03:24:59.280 --> 03:25:05.280]  And what I would ask is if they're actually going to attack him, because then that would allow him to respond.
[03:25:05.280 --> 03:25:09.280]  And they theoretically would want to give him as least camera time as possible.
[03:25:09.280 --> 03:25:15.280]  But they could also go for the angle of bringing up everything in his past and trying to attack him to try and break him down.
[03:25:15.280 --> 03:25:18.280]  But that seems to have not worked very well for them in the past.
[03:25:18.280 --> 03:25:23.280]  Some thoughts on that will definitely be an interesting, probably the most, quote unquote, brutal debate.
[03:25:23.280 --> 03:25:33.280]  And one of the key topics I'm sure of the entire debate and really of the decade is going to be the so-called robot takeover, right?
[03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:38.280]  Which I think overall, there's a medium to all of this.
[03:25:38.280 --> 03:25:44.280]  A new report says, the robots are coming for jobs that pay $20 an hour or less White House fines.
[03:25:44.280 --> 03:25:46.280]  This is from MarketWatch.
[03:25:46.280 --> 03:25:49.280]  It's intuitive the automation will take low-wage jobs,
[03:25:49.280 --> 03:25:55.280]  and the White House in its annual economic report of the president has broken down just how much that is so.
[03:25:55.280 --> 03:26:03.280]  According to the report, there's an 83% chance that automation will take a job with an hourly wage below $20.
[03:26:03.280 --> 03:26:08.280]  A 31% chance automation will take a job with an hourly wage between $20 and $40.
[03:26:08.280 --> 03:26:12.280]  And a 4% chance automation will take a job with an hourly wage above $40.
[03:26:12.280 --> 03:26:20.280]  So, when we're playing in the background, the Boston Dynamics AI robot, which played before you before,
[03:26:20.280 --> 03:26:24.280]  I saw it the other night, actually, when it first came out on Reddit, and I watched it.
[03:26:24.280 --> 03:26:31.280]  And I'll tell you what's interesting about this footage as well as that previous Boston Dynamics footage, which is the AI robots that walk around.
[03:26:31.280 --> 03:26:33.280]  Now, before, it was kind of like a dog.
[03:26:33.280 --> 03:26:40.280]  If you remember, it was like a robotic dog, and it would walk around, and they would kick it, and you felt bad for it.
[03:26:40.280 --> 03:26:42.280]  That's the craziest part. You would feel bad for the dog.
[03:26:42.280 --> 03:26:46.280]  And in this case, it shows a robot picking up boxes and stuff.
[03:26:46.280 --> 03:26:53.280]  And then there's one point where the guy has this stick, and he pushes the robot down on the ground, and you feel bad.
[03:26:53.280 --> 03:27:01.280]  You're like, wow, your internal responses are telling you that it looks like a human, so therefore you have sympathy for it, which is pretty wild to think about.
[03:27:01.280 --> 03:27:08.280]  It's also showing how he's pushing the box away, and the robot's trying to pick it up, and he's keep pushing it away with a hockey stick,
[03:27:08.280 --> 03:27:10.280]  and you feel bad for the robot.
[03:27:10.280 --> 03:27:15.280]  It's because we're so programmed in our brain to see something that looks like a human and feel bad for it,
[03:27:15.280 --> 03:27:24.280]  and that has some very interesting implications that our brains may not even be able to keep up to the point once it gets to a real-life human-looking robot.
[03:27:24.280 --> 03:27:26.280]  It could be very interesting.
[03:27:26.280 --> 03:27:34.280]  Now, conversely, we talked about how robots are going to take $20 an hour less jobs, or 30% chance they're going to take up to $40 an hour,
[03:27:34.280 --> 03:27:39.280]  and some people think, well, gee, it's going to destroy the entire economy.
[03:27:39.280 --> 03:27:46.280]  It might be the case, but the Guardian says that technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed according to 140 years of data,
[03:27:46.280 --> 03:27:48.280]  and you have to think about this.
[03:27:48.280 --> 03:27:55.280]  So it says, a study by economists at the Consultancy Deloitte seek to shed new light on the relationship between jobs and the rise of technology
[03:27:55.280 --> 03:28:00.280]  by trawling through census data for England and Wales, going back to 1871.
[03:28:00.280 --> 03:28:08.280]  Their conclusion is unremittingly cheerful. Rather than destroying jobs, technology has been a, quote, great job-creating machine.
[03:28:08.280 --> 03:28:15.280]  They say there's a four-fold rise in bar staff since 1950s, where a surge in the number of hairdressers this century suggested to the authors
[03:28:15.280 --> 03:28:20.280]  that technology is increasing spending power, creating new demand and new jobs.
[03:28:20.280 --> 03:28:29.280]  Machines will take on a more repetitive and laborious task, but seem no closer to eliminating the need for human labor than any time in the last 150 years.
[03:28:29.280 --> 03:28:32.280]  And it goes on, this is an important study to consider.
[03:28:32.280 --> 03:28:39.280]  It says, technology has quite clearly cut job costs, but Stuart and his colleagues question whether they're really jobs we would want to hold on to.
[03:28:39.280 --> 03:28:45.280]  Technology directly substitutes human muscle power in doing so, raises productivity and shrinks employment.
[03:28:45.280 --> 03:28:55.280]  It goes on to talk about how in 1901 there were 32.5 million population, and 200,000 people were engaged in washing clothes.
[03:28:55.280 --> 03:29:01.280]  But by 2011, a population of 56.1 million, 35,000 people were washing clothes.
[03:29:01.280 --> 03:29:07.280]  So basically, it's arguing that, yeah, the technology is there, it is emerging, the robot so-called culture is emerging.
[03:29:07.280 --> 03:29:14.280]  And we're not really at the point of really supreme robots yet, but this culture is emerging and they may just take the jobs that we don't want.
[03:29:14.280 --> 03:29:19.280]  But then you have to ask the question, well, who's behind it, right? Who's engaging in all this? Who's deciding who takes what jobs?
[03:29:19.280 --> 03:29:29.280]  Who's creating this artificial intelligence? Elon Musk and, I guess it was what, 10, 20,000 other professors at major universities have signed off on a document warning about artificial intelligence.
[03:29:29.280 --> 03:29:35.280]  There's so many aspects to it, but I think it's one of the most important subjects and it's definitely going to be brought up in the debate tonight.
[03:29:35.280 --> 03:29:40.280]  We're right back. Alex is supposed to come in live on Facebook Mentions and be a part of the show.
[03:29:40.280 --> 03:29:50.280]  We'll talk more about the debate and more. I'm Anthony Goodsharty. Stay tuned.
[03:30:10.280 --> 03:30:17.280]  $150 million on Jeb, they still haven't learned anything. Jeb's dropping out didn't help Rubio in Nevada.
[03:30:17.280 --> 03:30:25.280]  Rubio is the establishment's 20% solution. Jeb had a sense of entitlement, kind of like the donor class and the party elite that support Rubio.
[03:30:25.280 --> 03:30:31.280]  They believe they can openly oppose the voters on their key issues and still win, but Rubio is a little smarter.
[03:30:31.280 --> 03:30:39.280]  He realizes that his support for illegal immigration with a gang of eight was a betrayal of the voters, but he still thinks they're too stupid to see through the lies.
[03:30:39.280 --> 03:30:47.280]  He's called Breitbart, a conspiracy website, and the president of the ICE Union a liar when they exposed Rubio's betrayal with a gang of eight.
[03:30:47.280 --> 03:30:55.280]  The Rubio's campaign will provide a useful public service, identifying the GOP political class who will say anything to get elected.
[03:30:55.280 --> 03:31:10.280]  For Infowars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:31:26.280 --> 03:31:35.280]  Shower filters. We're introducing the best yet. The brand new ProPure ProMax high performance shower filter.

[03:31:59.280 --> 03:32:11.280]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry. Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:32:11.280 --> 03:32:20.280]  Thousands of years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:32:20.280 --> 03:32:24.280]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:32:24.280 --> 03:32:34.280]  Pathogens added to the food and water, and to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality, turn off our hormones, and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:32:34.280 --> 03:32:48.280]  Unfortunately, counter this onslaught with Anthroplex. Anthroplex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:32:48.280 --> 03:33:08.280]  Discover why Anthroplex has turned so many heads today. It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands, and it starts at InfowarsLife.com with Anthroplex.
[03:33:08.280 --> 03:33:18.280]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones, coming to you now from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:33:18.280 --> 03:33:24.280]  It's a motley crew. It is the fourth hour. It is Anthony Gucciardi. I'm going to be with you for the rest of the hour.
[03:33:24.280 --> 03:33:31.280]  And Alex is about to join us in this segment. He's live right now on Facebook Mention's. And we're going to talk about the debate and so much more.
[03:33:31.280 --> 03:33:40.280]  You know, with all the crazy news, I mean, truly the same news, right, coming out today. It's like an onion story as I said earlier. I have but one question, right?
[03:33:40.280 --> 03:33:49.280]  Tonight at the debates, will Marco Rubio have a Millie Vanilly moment, and will his CD track skip when he goes to speak when his, in the back, right?
[03:33:49.280 --> 03:33:55.280]  He's kind of like an artificial intelligence robot, and he has a speaking moment. He says the same thing eight times in a row.
[03:33:55.280 --> 03:34:05.280]  I wonder if his CD track will skip. So he kind of says Obama is Obama is Obama is and he kind of self destruction blows up and is like robotic bolts and screws go everywhere.
[03:34:05.280 --> 03:34:13.280]  I wonder if that's going to happen. Now also, we're not going to be able to take your calls because there's not enough time and Alex is about to come in, but I will be answering questions on Twitter.
[03:34:13.280 --> 03:34:20.280]  So if you tweet me at AS Gucciardi, I will be answering your questions live on air. So we'll try and get to those.
[03:34:20.280 --> 03:34:27.280]  Now also, there's been so much news lately that we really haven't even touched on so many different things.
[03:34:27.280 --> 03:34:32.280]  And that includes what's going on in New York. And John Bowne has an interesting report. I haven't seen it yet.
[03:34:32.280 --> 03:34:38.280]  I want to play it for you first here. Actually, it's a premiere as far as I'm aware. It's called Chernobyl on the Hudson.
[03:34:38.280 --> 03:34:43.280]  And we haven't given this enough attention because of all the craziness going on every single day in the news, right?
[03:34:43.280 --> 03:34:55.280]  There's so much to cover. But we have not even given enough attention to the massive tumor on the side of the United States, which is the leaking power plants across the country.
[03:34:55.280 --> 03:34:59.280]  Let's check out Chernobyl on the Hudson by John Bowne.
[03:34:59.280 --> 03:35:13.280]  It has been nicknamed Chernobyl on the Hudson, lying just 34 miles north of New York City's Central Park. The Indian Point Energy Center has been leaking the radioactive material known as tritium into the groundwater.
[03:35:13.280 --> 03:35:23.280]  On February 6, 2016, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo finally alerted the public as to the potential catastrophe. Better late than never?
[03:35:23.280 --> 03:35:32.280]  In 1973, the plant was shut down after engineers discovered buckling in the steel liner of the concrete dome in which the nuclear reactor is housed.
[03:35:32.280 --> 03:35:50.280]  On October 17, 1980, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposed a $2,100,000 fine for an incident involving 100,000 gallons of Hudson River water that had leaked into the Indian Point 2 containment building from the fan cooling unit undetected by a safety device designed to detect hot water.
[03:35:50.280 --> 03:36:06.280]  Two pumps which should have removed the water were found to be inoperative. In 1984, the New York Times reported that 25% of the young fish known as the Atlantic Tom Cod and 89% of the older Atlantic Tom Cod inhabiting the Hudson suffered from liver cancer.
[03:36:06.280 --> 03:36:21.280]  These mutated Tom Cods had evolved after GE dumped PCBs into the Hudson River from 1947 to 1976. In 2005, energy workers while digging discovered a small leak in a spent fuel pool.
[03:36:21.280 --> 03:36:29.280]  Water containing tritium and strontium-90 was leaking through a crack in the pool building and then finding its way into the nearby Hudson River.
[03:36:29.280 --> 03:36:48.280]  In 2007, a transformer at Unit 3 caught fire and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission raised its level of inspections. In April of 2007, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission fined the owner of the Indian Point nuclear plant $130,000 for failing to meet a deadline for a new emergency siren plant.
[03:36:48.280 --> 03:37:06.280]  The 150 sirens at the plant were meant to alert residents within 10 miles to a plant emergency. In 2009, an International Journal of Health Services study revealed that residents living on the Hudson had a 67% higher thyroid cancer rate than the national average.
[03:37:06.280 --> 03:37:19.280]  In 2010, an explosion occurred in a main transformer for Indian Point 2, spilling oil into the Hudson River. Entergy later agreed to pay a $1.2 million penalty for the transformer explosion.
[03:37:19.280 --> 03:37:40.280]  In July of 2013, a former supervisor who worked at Indian Point nuclear power plant for 29 years was arrested for falsifying critical safety records and lying to federal regulators. In June of 2015, a Mylar balloon floated into a switch yard causing an electrical problem resulting in the shutdown of Reactor 3.
[03:37:40.280 --> 03:37:53.280]  In July of 2015, Reactor 3 was again shut down after a water pump failure. On December 5th, 2015, Indian Point 2 was shut down after several control rods lost power.
[03:37:53.280 --> 03:38:18.280]  Obviously, Indian Point could potentially be a repeat of the, at the very least, level 7 Fukushima Daiichi disaster if a nuclear meltdown occurs due to a hurricane or other natural event leading to equipment failures. However, a similar disaster would require the evacuation of 5.6 million people and render Manhattan a no-go zone for decades.
[03:38:18.280 --> 03:38:37.280]  In 2004, a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists estimated as many as 44,000 near-term deaths from acute radiation syndrome and as many as 518,000 long-term cancer deaths could occur in people within 50 miles of Indian Point in the event of a severe accident.
[03:38:37.280 --> 03:38:55.280]  Potential disaster models reveal the Indian Point plume could reach Chernobyl mass event levels 9 times the radiation released at Fukushima. Indian Point is just one of at least 5 damaged nuclear power plants in the United States. They are an obvious target for terrorists.
[03:38:55.280 --> 03:39:03.280]  Just one more glaring reason why we need our borders closed to President Obama's unconstitutional executive order on immigration.
[03:39:03.280 --> 03:39:10.280]  John Bound for Infowars.com.
[03:39:33.280 --> 03:40:00.280]  So what's interesting is I've talked to people, right? And I saw your film, Dark Secrets, inside of Bohemian Grove years ago. And everyone always would say, you know, that sounds insane.
[03:40:00.280 --> 03:40:09.280]  And if they actually sit down and watch the film, they'll realize what's insane is the actual ceremony itself, right? You don't even have to say anything. You don't have to say anything. You just say, watch this.
[03:40:09.280 --> 03:40:15.280]  And they take it so seriously. It is like a play, but they're taking it so seriously.
[03:40:15.280 --> 03:40:25.280]  And then you go in there and now actually talking to you, right? And hearing the rest of the full story about what was going on and what they think you were doing in there and who they thought you were and all the craziness is like mind-blowing.
[03:40:25.280 --> 03:40:34.280]  And if you watch the film, which you should, it's on YouTube. If you have people watch the film too, you don't have to say anything. It's the footage speaks for itself. Just watch the best of or something. They're like singing in these weird rituals.
[03:40:34.280 --> 03:40:44.280]  And by the way, let me just do an infomercial here because that's how we fund our operation. You can get Dark Secrets inside Bohemian Grove in the order of death, two films on the 7th of the Occult, the Illuminati that I made and infiltrate these groups.
[03:40:44.280 --> 03:40:55.280]  And this is World News when I did it on DVD at infowarstore.com. You can watch it for free on YouTube and Google. We put it up for everybody for free, but if you want to have it in your archives, have it on the shelf, this is one film everybody should have, infowarstore.com.
[03:40:55.280 --> 03:41:00.280]  But Leanne, I love the fact that you and Biggs both text me like one in the morning when this broke last night. It was all in the news today.
[03:41:00.280 --> 03:41:14.280]  Secret Society, another deal, connection disorder, Illuminati command base, another deal. I think that you are so excited about this because it really does illustrate how crazy all of this is.
[03:41:14.280 --> 03:41:25.280]  So I'm going to turn this over to you and Anthony for about the next five minutes on Facebook mentions and then tell us tonight about the coverage coming up, 7 o'clock central with yourself and David Knight and others.
[03:41:25.280 --> 03:41:33.280]  Info Wars Nightly News will cover live the Republican debate for Super Tuesday coming up. So Leanne McAdoo, give us your breakdown for about five minutes.
[03:41:33.280 --> 03:41:41.280]  And then Anthony is going to do a plug. We're going to go to breaks and come back and finish the show. It's 7 o'clock tonight. InfoWars.com forward slash show to watch our live coverage. Leanne?
[03:41:41.280 --> 03:41:46.280]  Well, I'm totally dominating you right now, Anthony. I wish I had a chair.
[03:41:46.280 --> 03:41:50.280]  Well, we're going to get you a chair right here on the table.
[03:41:50.280 --> 03:41:51.280]  Same prompt you.
[03:41:51.280 --> 03:41:52.280]  Yes.
[03:41:52.280 --> 03:41:53.280]  We're bringing you a chair, Leanne.
[03:41:53.280 --> 03:42:00.280]  Well, I personally, I was so excited about the story. That's why I had to thank you. That's why I had a text to you late last night.
[03:42:00.280 --> 03:42:06.280]  Just like, oh my gosh, I know it's late, but you got to read this before the show tomorrow because to me, it's really exciting.
[03:42:06.280 --> 03:42:11.280]  I mean, we report about this stuff so much that it kind of gets mundane and it's sort of like, oh, whatever.
[03:42:11.280 --> 03:42:26.280]  But then this is like fresh. This is fresh. And like one of the most important Supreme Court justices dies during one of these secret meetings.
[03:42:26.280 --> 03:42:34.280]  While our guys are down there being harassed by a poindexter who's like, you're the kind of people I hate having at the ranch.
[03:42:34.280 --> 03:42:41.280]  You know, I love the you sophisticated friends that I have invited, not like these folks over here.
[03:42:41.280 --> 03:42:47.280]  I mean, it just, it just has all the trappings of a really great movie. So I'm excited.
[03:42:47.280 --> 03:42:52.280]  Definitely sounds like a good movie. Who knows what happened? How absurd, though. Such weirdness.
[03:42:52.280 --> 03:42:57.280]  It's almost like you couldn't invent all the weirdness, right? It's almost like if you were writing, like you said, a movie script.
[03:42:57.280 --> 03:43:06.280]  It's like, oh, there was some weird secret thing going on and there's skull photos, like devil photos. It just, it sounds, it sounds made up.
[03:43:06.280 --> 03:43:11.280]  That's the issue with even talking about it too, though, because it sounds so far fetched. But then you look at the mainstream sources.
[03:43:11.280 --> 03:43:17.280]  Yeah. I mean, someone working on a movie script right now is just like, yes, thank you because this is golden.
[03:43:17.280 --> 03:43:19.280]  I mean, it's on a cinematic ranch.
[03:43:19.280 --> 03:43:20.280]  Yeah.
[03:43:20.280 --> 03:43:24.280]  Because the real world's crazier than you made up crap.
[03:43:24.280 --> 03:43:25.280]  Right.
[03:43:25.280 --> 03:43:30.280]  It's so wild. And that it's so wild. All the conspiracy theories that were out there.
[03:43:30.280 --> 03:43:34.280]  I mean, there were so many articles about, oh, look at the conspiracy theories surrounding Scalia's death.
[03:43:34.280 --> 03:43:41.280]  And then it turns out it was even more bizarre than any other conspiracy theories that were being thrown around.
[03:43:41.280 --> 03:43:48.280]  Well, I think everyone has gotten to the point. If you just look at five years ago, if you were to look at five years from now, or previously, look up to now,
[03:43:48.280 --> 03:43:57.280]  look at the debates tonight, for example, every story is like, yes, Cruz and Ruby are just going to viciously assault Trump and bring up everything in his past and just try to destroy him and make up things about him.
[03:43:57.280 --> 03:44:04.280]  It's crazy. And then this is like, there's a secret society with demon paintings everywhere and Scalia died. He might have been on Viagra.
[03:44:04.280 --> 03:44:08.280]  It's like, what is happening is totally lost control in so many different ways.
[03:44:08.280 --> 03:44:14.280]  And then the mainstream media tries to take the narrative and always spin it with a direction against whatever they're opposing.
[03:44:14.280 --> 03:44:18.280]  And it gets so absurd that people don't even buy any of it anymore.
[03:44:18.280 --> 03:44:24.280]  The system is committing suicide. The system is murdering its own credibility through their narcissistic arrogance.
[03:44:24.280 --> 03:44:27.280]  You should come speak on the microphone.
[03:44:27.280 --> 03:44:29.280]  Because you already have a rich population.
[03:44:29.280 --> 03:44:30.280]  Right.
[03:44:30.280 --> 03:44:37.280]  Well, I think what comes after it is that the faith in the mainstream media is already gone and that people don't believe it anymore, even if it's true.
[03:44:37.280 --> 03:44:40.280]  They don't believe it just because their logo is on there.
[03:44:40.280 --> 03:44:47.280]  Right. And that's what's so interesting is that you have these secret societies that for hundreds of years have been able to maintain their secrets,
[03:44:47.280 --> 03:44:50.280]  maintain the secrecy of who's involved and what they do.
[03:44:50.280 --> 03:44:56.280]  And the world is changing. It's not a secret anymore. You see the planes flying in.
[03:44:56.280 --> 03:45:00.280]  So it's just really interesting to see that secrets are no more.
[03:45:00.280 --> 03:45:03.280]  And you're changing the world by doing different stuff. So can the viewers.
[03:45:03.280 --> 03:45:09.280]  Just like we started a few years ago, four years ago or whatever, covering live debates and covering stuff and commentary on media.
[03:45:09.280 --> 03:45:13.280]  Now everybody's doing it. And it's just an example of thinking outside the box, folks.
[03:45:13.280 --> 03:45:18.280]  I'm going to turn it back over to you guys. I'll normally wear purple red pants, but I was giving these for Christmas.
[03:45:18.280 --> 03:45:19.280]  Today's the day.
[03:45:19.280 --> 03:45:20.280]  I'm sporting them.
[03:45:20.280 --> 03:45:22.280]  No, take the microphone.
[03:45:22.280 --> 03:45:25.280]  Today's the day. No, no, no, no. I'm getting down here. I want you guys to talk and hang on.
[03:45:25.280 --> 03:45:27.280]  It's fun to walk around over there.
[03:45:27.280 --> 03:45:31.280]  I actually have a meeting about awesome apps we're getting built for M4s.
[03:45:31.280 --> 03:45:32.280]  What?
[03:45:32.280 --> 03:45:35.280]  The Darth Vader Death Star app.
[03:45:35.280 --> 03:45:40.280]  I know so many people have requested your voice for their ringtone.
[03:45:40.280 --> 03:45:42.280]  So you might want to work on that.
[03:45:42.280 --> 03:45:45.280]  Anytime you get a new article out, little buzz alarm with your.
[03:45:45.280 --> 03:45:47.280]  You'll wake up real quick with him screaming.
[03:45:47.280 --> 03:45:52.280]  No, nobody can meet me sitting there actually on helium. Alex Jones helium was going.
[03:45:52.280 --> 03:45:55.280]  I actually did a joke the other day on a tape, but I never played it.
[03:45:55.280 --> 03:45:57.280]  Let me see if I can actually play that for folks.
[03:45:57.280 --> 03:45:59.280]  That's interesting.
[03:45:59.280 --> 03:46:02.280]  It's ridiculous. No, no. I mean, I was going to shoot this video on helium balloons.
[03:46:02.280 --> 03:46:03.280]  My daughter's birthday.
[03:46:03.280 --> 03:46:05.280]  Everyone was like, Oh, just as clear.
[03:46:05.280 --> 03:46:08.280]  That is just like Kennedy natural.
[03:46:08.280 --> 03:46:11.280]  Let me see if I can actually find it.
[03:46:11.280 --> 03:46:14.280]  Now it's proven he did obviously died just of natural causes.
[03:46:14.280 --> 03:46:16.280]  There was nothing funky about it. It was totally normal.
[03:46:16.280 --> 03:46:19.280]  That's what the guy says. Obviously he died.
[03:46:19.280 --> 03:46:25.280]  He said, obviously he died peacefully in his sleep because his bed clothing was unwrinkled.
[03:46:25.280 --> 03:46:28.280]  He had a full tummy.
[03:46:28.280 --> 03:46:33.280]  Well, that's, I don't think we want to do a whole joke piece. Yes.
[03:46:33.280 --> 03:46:34.280]  We want to do a whole joke.
[03:46:34.280 --> 03:46:37.280]  We read all his quotes and how it's all scripted.
[03:46:37.280 --> 03:46:38.280]  It's like a children's story.
[03:46:38.280 --> 03:46:42.280]  There were little beds outside the room and the pope dropped by.
[03:46:42.280 --> 03:46:45.280]  Yeah, I think that's excellent.
[03:46:45.280 --> 03:46:47.280]  Meanwhile, voice a point extra.
[03:46:47.280 --> 03:46:53.280]  Meanwhile, Brazil is spending $250 million on an underwater cable to Europe.
[03:46:53.280 --> 03:46:59.280]  It's supported by Google and Facebook to avoid espionage attempts by the United States.
[03:46:59.280 --> 03:47:01.280]  Okay, so think about that for a minute.
[03:47:01.280 --> 03:47:03.280]  They're spending $250 million.
[03:47:03.280 --> 03:47:05.280]  It says this is from international business times.
[03:47:05.280 --> 03:47:10.280]  Brazil is constructing a dedicated underwater cable to link the southern American countries
[03:47:10.280 --> 03:47:14.280]  internet directly with Europe and avoid any espionage attempts by the United States,
[03:47:14.280 --> 03:47:20.280]  not ISIS, right, not al-Qaeda, not China, the United States.
[03:47:20.280 --> 03:47:26.280]  The structure, which is estimated to cost up to $250 million will come into operation by late 2017
[03:47:26.280 --> 03:47:29.280]  and is likely to be supported by tech giants Google and Facebook.
[03:47:29.280 --> 03:47:36.280]  So the United States own top corporations, Google and Facebook, are supporting the move to block US espionage.
[03:47:36.280 --> 03:47:43.280]  Just like Apple, according to their PR, is stopping the United States government from cracking into all their phones
[03:47:43.280 --> 03:47:46.280]  because once they set the president and they can look at everybody's stuff.
[03:47:46.280 --> 03:47:50.280]  Brazil's communications minister Andre Figueredo, I don't know how exactly to say that,
[03:47:50.280 --> 03:47:54.280]  said the nearly a dozen multinational tech giants have shown interest in becoming part of the venture.
[03:47:54.280 --> 03:48:00.280]  So a bunch of different tech giants in the United States also want to be a part of it to get rid of the US spying.
[03:48:00.280 --> 03:48:04.280]  Right, well, they see how ubiquitous this pinopticon is going to be.
[03:48:04.280 --> 03:48:08.280]  And then they come out and say, well, we need this backdoor to stop the bad guys from spying.
[03:48:08.280 --> 03:48:12.280]  Meanwhile, in the same sentence, James Clapper comes out and says,
[03:48:12.280 --> 03:48:16.280]  we're going to be using the Internet of Things to spy on you, to recruit.
[03:48:16.280 --> 03:48:19.280]  I mean, so they're the bad guys, sometimes.
[03:48:19.280 --> 03:48:25.280]  Well, it just shows how out of control everything has gotten to the point where the news now says that other countries
[03:48:25.280 --> 03:48:30.280]  and our own tech giants are building underwater cables to get rid of the United States spying on them.
[03:48:30.280 --> 03:48:31.280]  Right.
[03:48:31.280 --> 03:48:33.280]  Back a few years ago, they would at least deny that was happening.
[03:48:33.280 --> 03:48:34.280]  Right.
[03:48:34.280 --> 03:48:35.280]  But now it's so open.
[03:48:35.280 --> 03:48:37.280]  It's not making us safer, that's for sure.
[03:48:37.280 --> 03:48:42.280]  We have stuff like this where it says from Alternet, Big Pharma identified 7,000 government officials they need to control
[03:48:42.280 --> 03:48:44.280]  to run their price gouging operation.
[03:48:44.280 --> 03:48:49.280]  This reminds me of Martin Chacrelli raising the price of the drug that AIDS patients were taking by, you know,
[03:48:49.280 --> 03:48:53.280]  X thousand percentage from like $40 to 12,000 or whatever it was.
[03:48:53.280 --> 03:48:58.280]  And it says, hoping to counter the demand for action, drug companies have launched their massive advertising campaign,
[03:48:58.280 --> 03:49:03.280]  not only running radio and print ads, but placing ads on Facebook, Twitter and other social media websites.
[03:49:03.280 --> 03:49:08.280]  Yeah, it's not likely that you've seen or heard any of them. That's because drug chieftains don't care what you and I think.
[03:49:08.280 --> 03:49:12.280]  Moreover, they know they couldn't possibly persuade us to let them keep jacking their prices.
[03:49:12.280 --> 03:49:14.280]  Yeah, from $14 to $700.
[03:49:14.280 --> 03:49:20.280]  So their public relations effort has made the odd and seemingly counterproductive move of sidestepping the actual public
[03:49:20.280 --> 03:49:23.280]  narrowly targeting a very tiny audience.
[03:49:23.280 --> 03:49:24.280]  Guess who it is?
[03:49:24.280 --> 03:49:27.280]  7,000 government officials that make all the decisions.
[03:49:27.280 --> 03:49:28.280]  Wow.
[03:49:28.280 --> 03:49:35.280]  Marketing ads, CPC ads and stuff on Google, Facebook, Twitter, whatever, not to hit the public to change their mind on the price gouging,
[03:49:35.280 --> 03:49:37.280]  but the government officials that vote on it.
[03:49:37.280 --> 03:49:47.280]  One CEO arrogantly put it, quote, we've identified 7,000 Americans who matter, thus dismissing the other 330 million of us as nobodies,
[03:49:47.280 --> 03:49:51.280]  quote, we're focusing on those in policy positions to fight structural issues.
[03:49:51.280 --> 03:49:59.280]  By structural issues, he means convincing Congress to take no action to reform the present pricing structure of the monopolistic drug makers
[03:49:59.280 --> 03:50:01.280]  whose guiding corporate ethic is bleed them for all they've got.
[03:50:01.280 --> 03:50:09.280]  So it's no longer an effort to convince the public that something matters or convince you and I that maybe they have justification in doing that.
[03:50:09.280 --> 03:50:13.280]  Now the drug companies don't even care about their PR, just like the United States government doesn't care about the PR.
[03:50:13.280 --> 03:50:15.280]  It's like the mainstream media doesn't care about the PR.
[03:50:15.280 --> 03:50:23.280]  They're sidestepping completely and going straight for the jugular, going to the 7,000 officials that quote, matter instead of the people.
[03:50:23.280 --> 03:50:26.280]  So it doesn't even, they're not even pretending that we have power anymore.
[03:50:26.280 --> 03:50:35.280]  They're just literally serving up a big fat turkey to the oligarchs that you could call it, or the decision makers that run everything,
[03:50:35.280 --> 03:50:42.280]  the establishment bobblehead people and saying please take our offering and we will advertise to you and we will help you and we'll take you out to dinner
[03:50:42.280 --> 03:50:45.280]  and the 330 million people besides you, they don't matter at all.
[03:50:45.280 --> 03:50:48.280]  We'll be right back. I'm Anthony Gutiarty. This is the 4th Hour Total Craziness.

[03:54:17.280 --> 03:54:28.280]  Welcome back to the 4th hour of the Alex Jones show live, Manth in the Good Shardy with Leanne McAdoo and Rob Doin here on Facebook mentions periscope every possible live streaming app in the entire planet.
[03:54:28.280 --> 03:54:39.280]  And we've been talking about all the insane news, the Scalia stuff that's come out which sounds like something out of a fairy tale novel, Gone Bad, a dark Disney fairy tale novel.
[03:54:39.280 --> 03:54:45.280]  The 7000 people that Big Pharma is targeting to keep their price gouging in order and not caring about you.
[03:54:45.280 --> 03:54:52.280]  Leanne, let's talk about this debate for a minute. It's very possible that Rubio and Cruz are going to try and go for Trump's jugular.
[03:54:52.280 --> 03:54:58.280]  And first thing comes to my mind is why would they do that? Because that will just give him more attention.
[03:54:58.280 --> 03:55:03.280]  But it is possible they still want to be in the race. They still think that he could be destroyed at some point.
[03:55:03.280 --> 03:55:08.280]  What's your take on this? What do you think is going to happen tonight? And you're going to be covering it with a bunch of inforber's reporters tonight, aren't you?
[03:55:08.280 --> 03:55:16.280]  Absolutely. We're going live at 7 until about 10 o'clock. And Rob Do just let me know that we're actually going to be trying out an instant playback tonight.
[03:55:16.280 --> 03:55:23.280]  So in case we miss anything, we'll be able to play back what they've just said, Jacarie Jackson will be manning that station.
[03:55:23.280 --> 03:55:31.280]  But yeah, I think that Rubio and Cruz are going to have to please their establishment handlers. They're all saying take down Trump.
[03:55:31.280 --> 03:55:39.280]  We must take him out. It's time. Take him out. The New York Times guy is tweeting a funny tweet about assassinating him.
[03:55:39.280 --> 03:55:47.280]  So, you know, they're all saying it's time to take him out. So if Rubio and Cruz don't go after Trump and they only go after each other, which is what they seem to be doing.
[03:55:47.280 --> 03:55:52.280]  But that doesn't seem like it would work. It doesn't seem like it usually works when they attack him and almost just gives him more fire and more bait.
[03:55:52.280 --> 03:55:56.280]  And it just makes him have more time. And when they mention him, he gets to speak longer.
[03:55:56.280 --> 03:56:04.280]  Yeah. Well, and see, even just this article you were talking about before the break with the big pharma and the 7000 important people, the rest of us don't matter.
[03:56:04.280 --> 03:56:11.280]  It's just how can the establishment not realize that we are all ready for their heads to roll?
[03:56:11.280 --> 03:56:18.280]  Like they're all sitting on top of their ivory tower going, oh, the rabble rousers seem to be gathering in large crowds.
[03:56:18.280 --> 03:56:28.280]  And so that's, of course, why they send out the divide and conquer groups, the George Soros, NGOs to divide everyone up because they see us all starting to collect collectively say, you know what,
[03:56:28.280 --> 03:56:35.280]  the system is broken and we don't want any of you. So it's, I mean, that's why there's a Trump versus Bernie Sanders right now.
[03:56:35.280 --> 03:56:44.280]  And you see this huge movement with people because people are tired of Bernie Sanders is really the quote unquote anti establishment candidate as well in the Democratic side.
[03:56:44.280 --> 03:56:52.280]  Well, as I've said a million times before, and I think people would probably want to hang me for saying it, he has a lot of good stances on certain things.
[03:56:52.280 --> 03:57:03.280]  He's against the NSA. He's mostly anti establishment. It's just when you get into other other areas that people aren't aware of that you start to realize, hey, 90 plus percent tax for people that make any amount of money at all is really not a good idea.
[03:57:03.280 --> 03:57:07.280]  Right. Right. So that's that's that's discountable. It's not going to work.
[03:57:07.280 --> 03:57:18.280]  But at the same time, Trump, there's a lot of, you know, anti establishment, but there's some things with him to the question. Right. So at the same time, what the common thread is, though, that they're both considered to be anti establishment.
[03:57:18.280 --> 03:57:26.280]  And someone like Marco Rubio is the example of the establishment. And I think that he is actually computer system with a floppy disk in the back of his head.
[03:57:26.280 --> 03:57:32.280]  And tonight, the floppy disk could pop out anytime. Like if someone were to just tap him on the back of the head like that, the floppy disk.
[03:57:32.280 --> 03:57:38.280]  Yeah, I was saying he could have a Millie Vanilly moment to remember that. Yeah.
[03:57:38.280 --> 03:57:46.280]  Well, it's just where the CD track skips. He could do that. He could be saying like, it's it's clear that Obama, well, it's clear that it could go over and over and over again.
[03:57:46.280 --> 03:57:58.280]  So we never know. We never know what could happen. Right. Well, they're all puppets. They're all, you know, except for Trump, you know, and even I would say, I would dare say Bernie Sanders, even though I don't know who's puppets.
[03:57:58.280 --> 03:58:08.280]  I don't know who's puppets, but I will say that it's it is annoying when people sound fake when they when they try to sound statesman Lee and they try to be presentable, but it just comes off as fake and artificial.
[03:58:08.280 --> 03:58:14.280]  It just comes off as super, super fake. Someone that speaks like a regular human being would be much more appealing to me.
[03:58:14.280 --> 03:58:23.280]  All right, so we are done to catch the live debate coverage tonight at seven o'clock with Leanne and the rest of the into info wars reporters.
[03:58:23.280 --> 03:58:30.280]  It'll be a lot of interesting breakdown and it's supposed to be very, very brutal. I'm Anthony Guciardi and thanks so much for watching the fourth hour.
