[00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.894]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.894 --> 00:00:11.476]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.476 --> 00:00:13.017]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.017 --> 00:00:17.222]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.222 --> 00:00:21.286]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.007 --> 00:00:33.612]  We knew that they would have a new attack ready for Trump when he dominated, almost getting double the votes of the second place winner, Marco Rubio, in Nevada.
[00:00:33.612 --> 00:00:37.614]  And ahead of Super Tuesday next week, Trump is set to have a tsunami win.
[00:00:37.614 --> 00:00:43.977]  He's suddenly surging to a dead tie in major polls with Senator Ted Cruz in his home state, Texas.
[00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:47.863]  He is clearly going to probably beat Rubio coming up in Florida.
[00:00:47.863 --> 00:00:55.849]  The system is in panic as Drudge Report comes out with the headline that he is the nominee of the people, Donald J. Trump.
[00:00:55.849 --> 00:00:59.151]  And so we talked to Trump insider Roger Stone a few days ago.
[00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:00.772]  He's going to be in studio Friday.
[00:01:00.772 --> 00:01:06.957]  He said the new attack will be that Donald Trump is mafia and Donald Trump is corrupt and Donald Trump's finances.
[00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:09.779]  We've seen the IRS persecute Christians and gun owners and veterans.
[00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:11.560]  We know they've done it openly.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.201]  MSNBC said it's good.
[00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:14.121]  Persecute people.
[00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:14.962]  They deserve it.
[00:01:14.962 --> 00:01:17.563]  They're the racist Tea Party.
[00:01:17.563 --> 00:01:23.567]  And so you can't work in places like New York City and not run into some of that stuff with businesses.
[00:01:23.567 --> 00:01:24.487]  They're digging into that.
[00:01:24.487 --> 00:01:28.430]  A decade ago, somebody that he did a little bit of destruction with got indicted.
[00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.631]  This is the type of garbage they're going to use.
[00:01:30.631 --> 00:01:37.255]  And the reason I'm shooting this special report is we've got the articles, we've got the clip, where Mitt Romney
[00:01:37.921 --> 00:01:44.443]  Was on Neil Cavuto at about, what, three o'clock central on this Wednesday.
[00:01:44.443 --> 00:01:46.123]  And was going, I don't know what the dirt is.
[00:01:46.123 --> 00:01:47.723]  I don't know what the financials are.
[00:01:47.723 --> 00:01:50.744]  I'm not saying I've seen it or it even exists.
[00:01:50.744 --> 00:01:55.685]  But I got to tell you, you know, there's going to be something big in the finances of Trump.
[00:01:55.685 --> 00:01:58.506]  And boy, we just don't want to go with him and have Hillary get in.
[00:01:59.252 --> 00:02:05.416]  Well, they could make stuff up about Ted Cruz or Marco Rubio or anybody else, but they won't if those people play ball.
[00:02:05.416 --> 00:02:07.437]  Trump says he wants to audit the private Federal Reserve.
[00:02:07.437 --> 00:02:10.139]  He doesn't want multinational corporations that are based here to be tax exempt.
[00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:11.220]  That's not fair.
[00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.302]  He said he wants to control our borders and have sovereignty.
[00:02:14.302 --> 00:02:15.903]  He's against political correctness.
[00:02:15.903 --> 00:02:20.126]  He wants the 28 pages on Saudi Arabia and 9-11 to be released and the Bushes.
[00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:22.431]  Nobody else is doing that.
[00:02:22.431 --> 00:02:23.713]  This is so positive.
[00:02:23.713 --> 00:02:24.835]  It's so populist.
[00:02:24.835 --> 00:02:26.298]  He's riding that wave.
[00:02:26.298 --> 00:02:30.025]  They've tried to cheat him at every level, but it's failed because the people have seen through it.
[00:02:30.865 --> 00:02:39.730]  And I think the establishment is going to have even bigger problems if they continue to try to go against the will of the people and the huge awakening that's happening.
[00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:51.355]  Now Trump may not be perfect and he might turn into a man on a white horse, but we know the establishment we have now has been running things into the ground and wants to make us poor so they can micromanage us because they've already stolen the wealth.
[00:02:51.355 --> 00:02:52.696]  These people are not capitalists.
[00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:56.678]  These people are fascists using socialism to domesticate the population.
[00:02:56.678 --> 00:02:57.739]  Now let's go to this clip.
[00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:03.860]  And understand, they're scared of Donald Trump, and this is the next big push.
[00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:16.483]  The fact that he is so aggressive in avoiding any discussion of taxes, of his taxes, and is not willing to put them out so far, suggests that there's something in there he doesn't want us to see.
[00:03:16.483 --> 00:03:22.084]  Frankly, I think we have good reason to believe that there's a bombshell in Donald Trump's taxes.
[00:03:23.357 --> 00:03:26.219]  Listening to Governor Romney and the issue that he just brought up.
[00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.220]  Yeah, what do you think of that?
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.162]  I think that Donald Trump's going to have some explaining to do.
[00:03:31.162 --> 00:03:35.124]  I think that every question is going to go back to that.
[00:03:35.124 --> 00:03:46.191]  And you've got Hillary Clinton on one side who's... Notice how it's key scripted points that they're both saying in unison on Cavuto's show with Cavuto sitting there nodding his head.
[00:03:46.551 --> 00:03:51.998]  This is the establishment scripting everything and Rupert Murdoch is on record as a Hillary supporter.
[00:03:51.998 --> 00:03:55.101]  This is Hillary through Fox News trying to take out Donald Trump.
[00:03:56.767 --> 00:03:59.829]  Well, if you can't stand the heat, you ought not to get in the kitchen.
[00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.413]  It's kind of the old saying about running for President of the United States.
[00:04:04.413 --> 00:04:06.414]  They're going to ask you about everything.
[00:04:06.414 --> 00:04:11.618]  And if you don't have a legitimate answer, I don't know or I'm not going to tell you is not appropriate.
[00:04:11.618 --> 00:04:17.442]  So we've got Mitt Romney, we've got Rick Perry, the guy that lied and said Gardasil shots were the law in Texas.
[00:04:17.442 --> 00:04:21.385]  We've got all these establishment Republicans coming out and saying, we don't know what's in there, but it's going to be bad.
[00:04:21.385 --> 00:04:21.886]  It's going to be big.
[00:04:22.817 --> 00:04:28.100]  I can barely even know what's going on in my own daily life with my checkbook and my life because I'm running so much stuff.
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.683]  And my life's probably one twentieth as complex running a major media operation as Donald Trump's.
[00:04:33.683 --> 00:04:35.604]  So now, we already know what the attack is from Stone.
[00:04:35.604 --> 00:04:46.210]  Again, they're going to go in to maybe one, maybe two people that he's worked with in huge construction deals, out of hundreds he's done, that ended up being bad people and claim that he's tied in with that.
[00:04:47.116 --> 00:04:52.761]  We know Hillary and Obama financed ISIS to kill tens of thousands of Christians in Libya and Syria!
[00:05:02.073 --> 00:05:02.954]  Hey, what's going on?
[00:05:02.954 --> 00:05:04.635]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[00:05:04.635 --> 00:05:06.397]  What are you guys doing this Thursday?
[00:05:06.397 --> 00:05:07.798]  Probably nothing.
[00:05:07.798 --> 00:05:15.404]  You're gonna get off work, sit down, go through your TV channels, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, definitely a no.
[00:05:15.404 --> 00:05:18.347]  Watching Dung Beetles on Discovery Channel, negative.

[00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:43.871]  Haha!
[00:05:43.871 --> 00:05:45.994]  So get some popcorn, sit down and enjoy!

[00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:02.277]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:06:02.277 --> 00:06:10.521]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[00:06:10.521 --> 00:06:15.923]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[00:08:06.487 --> 00:08:10.890]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:12.871]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:08:12.871 --> 00:08:18.514]  Coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[00:08:18.514 --> 00:08:21.216]  Are we seeing the earth?
[00:08:21.216 --> 00:08:23.057]  We've got it.
[00:08:23.057 --> 00:08:26.819]  Are we seeing the earth?
[00:08:26.819 --> 00:08:28.040]  We've got it.
[00:08:29.848 --> 00:08:37.111]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is a very important Thursday worldwide broadcast, the 25th day of February, 2016.
[00:08:37.111 --> 00:08:42.633]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:49.816]  We're gonna be here for the next four hours of a very important transmission lined up for you, obviously.
[00:08:49.816 --> 00:08:58.300]  We have two pieces of giant news that are so over the top, they've got my heart racing, and that never happens on air.
[00:09:01.195 --> 00:09:11.261]  Number one, they had a high-level New York Times employee columnist come out and say, we need to kill Donald Trump.
[00:09:11.261 --> 00:09:23.688]  And then put a video out from a film of a populist politician basically being assassinated or trying to be assassinated by Christopher Walken.
[00:09:23.688 --> 00:09:28.831]  And of course, who he's trying to assassinate is the person running for president played by Martin Sheen.
[00:09:29.858 --> 00:09:32.220]  It's bizarre, I know both those guys.
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:41.527]  But expanding on this, it's the left's praise of it and their tweets saying, yes, let's kill Donald Trump.
[00:09:41.527 --> 00:09:50.214]  Now I wonder if he's found dead with a pillow over his face and there's no autopsy, will you be a conspiracy theorist to call for law to be enforced and for there to be an investigation?
[00:09:50.214 --> 00:09:52.075]  We're going to go over this in great detail.
[00:09:52.075 --> 00:09:56.298]  It's top-linked right now on DrudgeReport.com.
[00:09:59.355 --> 00:10:04.357]  New York Times columnist jokes about assassination attempt ending Trump's campaign.
[00:10:04.357 --> 00:10:08.398]  Infowars.com, Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:10:08.398 --> 00:10:15.000]  And then at the bottom of the report is a very powerful video I shot yesterday for the Infowars Nightly News.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:15.720]  Leaked!
[00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:17.761]  New Republican plan to destroy Trump.
[00:10:17.761 --> 00:10:23.682]  We played part of that report, but not the finale, at the start of the last segment.
[00:10:23.682 --> 00:10:25.103]  Some stations don't carry that first segment.
[00:10:26.104 --> 00:10:27.885]  So that's up on Infowars.com.
[00:10:27.885 --> 00:10:39.531]  Both of those in that article are extremely, extremely, extremely, extremely important, and I'm asking all of you Infowarriors to pass that story on to everyone you know.
[00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:42.712]  We're gonna be going over it in great detail.
[00:10:42.712 --> 00:10:54.498]  Separately, I've been up since six o'clock this morning working on this, and Paul Joseph Watson is working on a story right now, so is Kit Daniels.
[00:10:57.512 --> 00:10:59.713]  And quite frankly, they already had stories ready to go.
[00:10:59.713 --> 00:11:05.075]  And I said, stop.
[00:11:05.075 --> 00:11:07.576]  We don't follow the news.
[00:11:07.576 --> 00:11:10.677]  We lead the news.
[00:11:10.677 --> 00:11:16.739]  And on this piece of Scalia news, I'm about to cover.
[00:11:16.739 --> 00:11:27.143]  When I woke up this morning and saw a text message from Joe Beggs and one from Leanne McAdoo, it blew me away.
[00:11:35.592 --> 00:11:38.113]  It was in the Washington Post.
[00:11:38.113 --> 00:11:40.955]  It was also in the Daily Mail and a bunch of other publications.
[00:11:40.955 --> 00:11:45.618]  And when I read it, I knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:11:45.618 --> 00:11:53.563]  We had Clinton insider Larry Nichols on yesterday who did talk to one of the surviving conservative justices.
[00:11:53.563 --> 00:11:55.084]  I think you can guess who we're talking about.
[00:11:55.084 --> 00:11:58.786]  I don't know the point of not just admitting who it is.
[00:11:58.786 --> 00:12:02.428]  The government already sent feds out to Nichols' house to threaten him.
[00:12:04.898 --> 00:12:07.019]  But I won't say the name.
[00:12:07.019 --> 00:12:14.662]  And he said there is a federal investigation about to start, a special investigator, special counsel, and there's a private investigation.
[00:12:14.662 --> 00:12:19.524]  Dick Cheney said, quote, no comment when he was asked by the media.
[00:12:19.524 --> 00:12:29.308]  And then I get up at six o'clock this morning, stumble into the bathroom, put water on my face, brush my teeth,
[00:12:32.366 --> 00:12:33.347]  That's just my ritual.
[00:12:33.347 --> 00:12:39.092]  Then I'd go into the shower, take a hot shower for five minutes, take a second shower after I work out, a long one.
[00:12:39.092 --> 00:12:41.274]  It's just my ritual.
[00:12:41.274 --> 00:12:52.763]  And I went in and sat down at the coffee table and turned on my iPad, and it was mirroring texts from Leanne and Biggs at like one in the morning.
[00:12:52.763 --> 00:12:57.748]  They weren't together, but they were both texting me then.
[00:12:57.748 --> 00:12:58.989]  And I saw the headline.
[00:13:00.649 --> 00:13:09.973]  Justice Scalia spent his last hours with members of a secretive society of elite hunters.
[00:13:09.973 --> 00:13:16.036]  Man, they're good at spending stuff.
[00:13:16.036 --> 00:13:23.979]  Man, they're good at engaging in disinformation.
[00:13:23.979 --> 00:13:28.161]  This Poindexter fellow was in black ops in the army.
[00:13:30.868 --> 00:13:34.990]  Not just in Vietnam, but all over the world.
[00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:54.058]  Nichols, who was involved in Iran-Contra as a commando, leading teams, says he's basically been at this guy's ranch, the one they would run out of, out of one country into another down in Central America.
[00:13:54.058 --> 00:13:57.760]  That was yesterday.
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:58.520]  You add to that,
[00:14:02.179 --> 00:14:12.426]  That they would spin this and say that it was a hunting secret society.
[00:14:12.426 --> 00:14:21.592]  I am, other than the people that are in these cults, the leading outside expert on them.
[00:14:21.592 --> 00:14:25.275]  But let me just give you a crash course before we go into this article, then I'm getting into Trump.
[00:14:26.462 --> 00:14:32.635]  Then we're going to have video reports, the photos, exclusive intel inside that ranch at the bottom of the next hour.
[00:14:37.062 --> 00:14:58.506]  There was a renaissance starting in about 1500 in Europe that was unseating the Catholic Church's power and the nobility's power who ran monopolies and wouldn't let anybody basically be a cobbler who made shoes or anything else seen as industrial unless you were given a certification license by the nobility.
[00:14:58.506 --> 00:15:02.266]  And that caused the Dark Ages because they didn't want any competition.
[00:15:02.266 --> 00:15:03.547]  The Dark Ages from about 410
[00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.901]  All the way up to about 1500.
[00:15:07.901 --> 00:15:13.622]  More than a thousand years.
[00:15:13.622 --> 00:15:18.043]  You can also call it the Middle Ages, a shorter period in there.
[00:15:18.043 --> 00:15:26.206]  And if you understand this, you understand the entire system of the battle in the West for the future.
[00:15:26.206 --> 00:15:31.427]  The Roman Empire falls, later the Byzantine Empire falls to the Muslims in Constantinople.
[00:15:33.598 --> 00:15:38.179]  Rome almost falls in the 800s.
[00:15:38.179 --> 00:15:46.702]  There are crusades out of France and England, led by the Norse, the Vikings, who had conquered England and France.
[00:15:46.702 --> 00:15:58.386]  The Norse, who also founded Russia, crush the invaders in six different major invasions, killing millions on both sides.
[00:16:00.495 --> 00:16:05.538]  Almost depopulating the Middle East and areas of Europe.
[00:16:05.538 --> 00:16:13.123]  A death battle.
[00:16:13.123 --> 00:16:19.707]  By the 1400s, people are sick of the tyranny of the monopolies of the nobility and the church.
[00:16:19.707 --> 00:16:29.674]  And they begin to use what's left of ancient masonry and ancient pre-Christian secret societies that I would not call satanic.
[00:16:31.198 --> 00:16:36.742]  Definitely occultic and hidden.
[00:16:36.742 --> 00:16:44.306]  To try to form a system to challenge the establishment and bring in a new enlightenment.
[00:16:44.306 --> 00:16:52.792]  They team up with the Rosicrucians, an ancient Christian sect, predating Roman Catholicism and the Orthodox Church both.
[00:16:57.079 --> 00:16:59.001]  But they were mystics.
[00:16:59.001 --> 00:17:16.435]  Those groups merge, and from the middle of the 1400s to the 1760s, they had overthrown the real power of the monarchies, and started the Reformation, and had driven a tyrannical form of Catholicism out of much of Europe.
[00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:19.117]  Incredible prosperity was booming.
[00:17:19.117 --> 00:17:21.519]  Monopolies were being broken.
[00:17:21.519 --> 00:17:26.603]  Power of the people, under different acts, like Magna Carta, expanding through,
[00:17:29.059 --> 00:17:32.820]  We're empowering the people.
[00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.820]  Comparatively, none of it was perfect.
[00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.380]  Both sides had problems.
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:38.981]  Both sides began to infiltrate each other.
[00:17:38.981 --> 00:17:46.642]  I'm going to skip this network break, this is so important.
[00:17:46.642 --> 00:17:54.524]  Christians and Masons that actually followed Christ by that point, Christian Masons,
[00:17:57.259 --> 00:18:07.506]  Launched their operations in the colonies and believed they were finally going to have a truly free country to empower humanity.
[00:18:07.506 --> 00:18:09.968]  And the goal was to end slavery, empower women.
[00:18:09.968 --> 00:18:12.650]  It had to be done in phases.
[00:18:12.650 --> 00:18:16.072]  They launched the entire operation that was Francis Bacon's plan.
[00:18:16.072 --> 00:18:17.513]  The New Atlantis.
[00:18:17.513 --> 00:18:20.315]  They defeat the British Empire that no one had ever stopped.
[00:18:22.096 --> 00:18:25.345]  Working with the French that had launched their own plan.
[00:18:25.345 --> 00:18:30.157]  The problem was the German Illuminati led by Adam Weishaupt, a Jesuit.
[00:18:31.690 --> 00:18:42.659]  Had launched a counter-revolution secretly in the 1760s, and when he saw the 1776 revolution launch, he went operational with their counterfeit 1776.
[00:18:42.659 --> 00:18:47.423]  I know this from George Washington, he wrote a bunch of letters on it, but it's also in the histories.
[00:18:47.423 --> 00:18:54.008]  So you got George Washington in the West battling the head of the Illuminati, a Satanist, in the East.
[00:18:54.008 --> 00:18:54.729]  Classic battle.
[00:18:56.536 --> 00:18:57.176]  And they killed him.
[00:18:57.176 --> 00:18:58.156]  They poisoned him.
[00:18:58.156 --> 00:18:59.237]  They bled him to death.
[00:18:59.237 --> 00:19:00.897]  He was poisoned, they came in, they bled him to death.
[00:19:00.897 --> 00:19:01.617]  They killed George Washington.
[00:19:01.617 --> 00:19:07.258]  He was getting ready to come back into politics and face them.
[00:19:07.258 --> 00:19:12.199]  They killed him.
[00:19:12.199 --> 00:19:22.541]  And so, there's been a battle between the German, and they're not German, but it's German-based, Bavarian Illuminati, and the Western
[00:19:24.508 --> 00:19:29.712]  New Atlantis Renaissance Group, which is the real Illuminati.
[00:19:29.712 --> 00:19:30.873]  They never called themselves that.
[00:19:30.873 --> 00:19:32.334]  They said, we're the enlightenment.
[00:19:32.334 --> 00:19:33.915]  So the Illuminati said, oh, we're the light.
[00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:39.316]  They launched their counterfeit populist operation.
[00:19:39.316 --> 00:19:41.177]  They come in and they infiltrate.
[00:19:41.177 --> 00:19:48.760]  You can read Weissop's writings because one of his letter carriers got struck down with a big manual that had copies of it to be given to other members in France.
[00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.260]  He got struck by lightning.
[00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:52.141]  This is an Encyclopedia Britannica, by the way.
[00:19:52.141 --> 00:19:53.542]  This is not my opinion.
[00:19:53.542 --> 00:19:54.422]  He got struck down.
[00:19:54.422 --> 00:19:56.723]  And again, I'm an expert on this.
[00:19:56.723 --> 00:19:58.524]  Discovery Channel, History Channel, interview me.
[00:19:58.524 --> 00:19:59.484]  I mean, I know what I'm talking about.
[00:20:01.206 --> 00:20:03.131]  I know the stuff 33rd Degree Masons know, okay?
[00:20:03.131 --> 00:20:05.477]  And I learned it from research and historical information.
[00:20:05.477 --> 00:20:07.864]  It's all hidden right there.
[00:20:07.864 --> 00:20:09.488]  And so what happened is this group...
[00:20:10.973 --> 00:20:20.000]  Branded itself, and Weishaupt said, we'll take over the hunting societies and lodges for men that like to hunt, like the company, you know, guys sitting around drinking beer, the deer hunters.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.746]  We will take over the reading societies and the literature societies and the music societies, and then we will take over the sexual secret societies.
[00:20:27.746 --> 00:20:33.291]  There's a lot of folks wanting to be able to have sex with more than one person, or maybe they were gay or whatever, so there were sexual secret societies.
[00:20:34.424 --> 00:20:58.792]  And he said, we'll claim that we support all of these, that we're the original progenitors of these, and we'll claim that we're the Rosicrucians, and the Christians, and the Merovingians, and all of it, and then our plan is total dominance and control to get rid of the church, and to get rid of Christianity, and get rid of the Muslims as well, and set ourselves up as absolute Luciferians over the world.
[00:20:58.792 --> 00:21:01.713]  So when you read about Justice Scalia,
[00:21:04.179 --> 00:21:09.122]  Dying, and there's a pillow over his head, and they got private jets at the airport, but he's not put on those.
[00:21:09.122 --> 00:21:11.503]  That, by the way, he flew in on.
[00:21:11.503 --> 00:21:12.924]  That's now confirmed.
[00:21:12.924 --> 00:21:17.426]  And then they drive him to another town, and they act all suspicious, and they change their stories.
[00:21:17.426 --> 00:21:20.327]  Obviously, something was being covered up.
[00:21:20.327 --> 00:21:25.390]  Now, I would say a 98% chance they killed him before, because of all the suspiciousness and the behavior.
[00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:27.691]  Now it's a 90% chance somebody killed him.
[00:21:27.691 --> 00:21:31.453]  Maybe less, because it could have been they were involved in a bunch of rituals.
[00:21:31.453 --> 00:21:32.534]  Who knows who was out there?
[00:21:33.618 --> 00:21:34.818]  They don't want this to come out.
[00:21:34.818 --> 00:21:36.259]  They wanted to clean it up.
[00:21:36.259 --> 00:21:39.160]  That place looks like something out of The Shining, as our crew said.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:42.340]  Not just Day of the Dead stuff, which isn't satanic.
[00:21:42.340 --> 00:21:43.801]  It's about celebrating your ancestors.
[00:21:43.801 --> 00:21:44.521]  I've looked at it.
[00:21:44.521 --> 00:21:47.122]  You know, November 30th.
[00:21:47.122 --> 00:21:48.122]  It's not Halloween.
[00:21:48.122 --> 00:21:49.962]  Nothing to do with it.
[00:21:49.962 --> 00:21:57.845]  Some of the occultists have jumped on the bandwagon, but there were sculptures that we're going to be showing later for TV viewers and radio listeners that aren't just, you know, Mexican masks or voodoo masks.
[00:21:57.845 --> 00:22:02.646]  Some of it is occultic, but actual sculptures of Satanism and children being sacrificed.
[00:22:03.846 --> 00:22:10.469]  So the bottom of the next hour, we're going to get to that in detail.
[00:22:10.469 --> 00:22:11.169]  But I want to be clear.
[00:22:11.169 --> 00:22:15.311]  I'm not saying Scalia was part of a satanic order.
[00:22:15.311 --> 00:22:17.552]  But they're now being forced in the Washington Post.
[00:22:18.766 --> 00:22:22.707]  To go, okay, there was a secret society meeting.
[00:22:22.707 --> 00:22:36.630]  It's a Christian-Catholic society of hunters that was around for 300-plus years, and the Nazis destroyed it because they wouldn't make Herman Goering the head of it, who was a big huntsman, and they dumbed it all down.
[00:22:40.103 --> 00:22:41.524]  Now we're just admitting it.
[00:22:41.524 --> 00:22:46.907]  Then they go to say it was reconstituted in the 1960s at Bohemian Grove, north of San Francisco.
[00:22:46.907 --> 00:22:48.688]  So then you have to have a whole history of that.
[00:22:48.688 --> 00:22:53.031]  I'm the guy that snuck in successfully, infiltrated, got the only footage out.
[00:22:53.031 --> 00:22:55.032]  Everybody else has been arrested or imprisoned.
[00:22:55.032 --> 00:22:59.475]  I was able to do it by the grace of God.
[00:22:59.475 --> 00:23:03.678]  It itself is a German death cult Illuminati.
[00:23:03.678 --> 00:23:04.618]  So is Skull and Bones 1832.
[00:23:06.573 --> 00:23:20.039]  And a president, Taft, a member of Skull and Bones on the East Coast, founded by the Bavarian Illuminati, that's on record, in 1832 in the US, 50-something years after it was founded in Germany, Lodge 322,
[00:23:21.798 --> 00:23:34.626]  By the 1870s, he was already traveling there before he was president, and taking over the Bohemian Grove that was a writer's club and a party club to bring prostitutes to, basically, female prostitutes that Mark Twain and others attended.
[00:23:34.626 --> 00:23:44.473]  They kicked them all out, took it over by the 1900s, and presidents began traveling there, and they brought up Bavarian Illuminati rituals there.
[00:23:45.612 --> 00:23:50.775]  Now we have this from Helmut Schmidt, former German Chancellor, author of Men and Powers, a Political Retrospective.
[00:23:50.775 --> 00:23:54.517]  He writes about it, he goes, we have our own groves, we do our own Illuminati rituals.
[00:23:54.517 --> 00:23:56.057]  This is a public book.
[00:23:56.057 --> 00:24:04.362]  He goes, more gets done at Bohemian Grove, the Trilateral Commission, the CFR, and our own Bavarian groves, where we do rituals.
[00:24:04.362 --> 00:24:06.163]  He goes, it's the most important grove in the world.
[00:24:06.163 --> 00:24:10.185]  And in my film, I have the book, I open it, I show screenshots, and I show the text.
[00:24:10.185 --> 00:24:14.327]  In my film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, and part two of that is The Order of Death.
[00:24:15.267 --> 00:24:17.048]  They're both free online at YouTube.
[00:24:17.048 --> 00:24:20.629]  You can buy them in DVD and higher res at InfowarsStore.com.
[00:24:20.629 --> 00:24:25.151]  But I digress.
[00:24:25.151 --> 00:24:28.132]  And we'll have some B-roll from my films later in the next hour.
[00:24:28.132 --> 00:24:30.873]  This will be a day long remembered.
[00:24:30.873 --> 00:24:38.036]  Now, Bohemian Grove is founded by the Illuminati.
[00:24:38.036 --> 00:24:39.237]  So is Skull and Bones.
[00:24:39.237 --> 00:24:42.058]  Then, it founds other chapters under it.
[00:24:43.567 --> 00:24:59.234]  At a southwest Texas, on the border, 30,000 acre ranch, with a black ops commander connected to Iran-Contra, who gets presidential awards from Obama, and Scalia dies there with two private wide-body jets, one of them he flew in on with his best friend, and he's not put on that and flown back to D.C.
[00:24:59.234 --> 00:25:03.996]  that takes three hours, he's driven three and a half hours to El Paso.
[00:25:03.996 --> 00:25:05.016]  We knew there was a cover-up.
[00:25:10.322 --> 00:25:17.487]  And that may have covered up the circumstances because it was Valentine's Day and Mr. Scalia wasn't with his wife.
[00:25:17.487 --> 00:25:21.770]  He was out in the middle of nowhere, a hundred miles from any town.
[00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:28.294]  Now, I don't know what went on, but I know what goes on at Bohemian Grove that Scalia has attended.
[00:25:28.294 --> 00:25:29.455]  And it's in my films.
[00:25:29.455 --> 00:25:32.317]  And it's what Wayne Madsen hinted at and got into.
[00:25:32.317 --> 00:25:37.741]  And that is all men massively
[00:25:40.405 --> 00:25:47.330]  Gay overtones, but a lot of the men are not bisexual or homosexual.
[00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:56.337]  And then in town there are hotels and a golf course where it's chock full of hundreds of the top prostitutes, female, of the world that arrive.
[00:25:56.337 --> 00:25:59.260]  And this has been in Time Magazine, Newsweek, you name it, articles about it.
[00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:06.003]  And when I snuck in there 16 years ago, I was pretty good-looking.
[00:26:06.003 --> 00:26:07.764]  And now I realize why I was able to get in.
[00:26:07.764 --> 00:26:09.865]  Mike Hanson was a good-looking fellow as well.
[00:26:09.865 --> 00:26:11.026]  You can see in the footage.
[00:26:11.026 --> 00:26:12.807]  And we were getting whistled at by people.
[00:26:12.807 --> 00:26:19.872]  We had to hide out basically under a building until dark because guys were coming up trying to grab our butts.
[00:26:19.872 --> 00:26:21.774]  And I'm talking about billionaires, folks.
[00:26:21.774 --> 00:26:24.976]  There's only like 1,500 members tops.
[00:26:24.976 --> 00:26:26.937]  They can each have one guest.
[00:26:26.937 --> 00:26:29.699]  I'm not saying Clint Eastwood goes there and he's a bad guy.
[00:26:29.699 --> 00:26:31.040]  Most people going there are not bad.
[00:26:32.995 --> 00:26:34.916]  They have amazing music, food, all of it.
[00:26:34.916 --> 00:26:36.096]  Over 100 camps inside.
[00:26:36.096 --> 00:26:38.417]  It's inside a gorge on the Russian River.
[00:26:38.417 --> 00:26:38.978]  It's beautiful.
[00:26:38.978 --> 00:26:40.639]  One of the prettiest places in the world.
[00:26:40.639 --> 00:26:43.560]  Looks like Bavaria.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.502]  And looks like the Black Forest.
[00:26:47.502 --> 00:26:51.884]  And that's the outer room to be invited to that.
[00:26:51.884 --> 00:26:58.747]  And then you get into the deeper Illuminati if you get vetted and if they like you.
[00:26:58.747 --> 00:27:01.088]  It is a way to get to know you socially and let your hair down.
[00:27:03.203 --> 00:27:10.129]  And again, it's in my films that break all of it down in great detail.
[00:27:10.129 --> 00:27:16.255]  So, Scalia spent his last hours with members of his secretive society of elite hunters.
[00:27:16.255 --> 00:27:17.136]  That's how they spent it.
[00:27:17.136 --> 00:27:19.438]  They claim it's an order of St.
[00:27:19.438 --> 00:27:25.223]  Hubertus, founded more than 300 years ago in Germany and Austria.
[00:27:27.367 --> 00:27:37.411]  And reportedly Poinsdexter is a member of it, and he's at the table, surrounded by all this occultic regalia.
[00:27:37.411 --> 00:27:48.636]  Scalia is an officer of it, and this is a dead society, destroyed by the Nazis, that's resurrected at the Bavarian spinoff in Northern California, Bohemian Grove.
[00:27:48.636 --> 00:27:54.438]  Now, I told you about the Order of Death, a very important 800-page book that I've read twice.
[00:27:57.073 --> 00:28:02.597]  Written by Heinz... I think Hobart's the name, funny it's Hubertus, it's the saint.
[00:28:02.597 --> 00:28:05.840]  And I read it in other historical books, but this is from declassified documents.
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:11.244]  The Nazis were getting rid of the old Illuminati because they didn't want anything that stood in their way.
[00:28:11.244 --> 00:28:22.993]  And so, because he wouldn't... the leader of it wouldn't basically put Hermann Goering, head of the German Luftwaffe, Hitler's
[00:28:24.744 --> 00:28:26.926]  Left-hand man in charge of it.
[00:28:26.926 --> 00:28:33.073]  They killed the leader of the order and that's in the Washington Post and in the Daily Mail.
[00:28:34.793 --> 00:28:49.102]  Because they wouldn't let them take it over, and that's in order of the death said, that they were taking out the different Illuminati spinoff groups, the Masonic groups, all of them, that didn't fully turn over their entire secret organization to the Nazis.
[00:28:49.102 --> 00:28:57.187]  So people like to make these jokes, oh Jones says German death cults run it all, Germans, you know, Illuminati, well no, it started there.
[00:28:57.947 --> 00:29:02.029]  But it's a worldwide system of control and that's what it is.
[00:29:02.029 --> 00:29:07.871]  So who could make this up that we have five reporters down there showing all the occultic iconography.
[00:29:07.871 --> 00:29:13.433]  Who could make this up that I'm in the middle of Bohemian Grove and that Joe Biggs tweeted out and put on his Instagram.
[00:29:13.433 --> 00:29:14.273]  We're going to show it later.
[00:29:14.273 --> 00:29:19.435]  We're going to line all this stuff up and just show it all to you.
[00:29:19.435 --> 00:29:21.576]  Saying this is like Bohemian Grove 2.0.
[00:29:21.576 --> 00:29:24.197]  Well, it turns out it is the Texas Bohemian Grove.
[00:29:25.202 --> 00:29:26.823]  And they've got other ones around the country as well.
[00:29:26.823 --> 00:29:30.424]  These are real Illuminati chapters.
[00:29:30.424 --> 00:29:37.547]  And strangely enough, you know, I wasn't invited into chapters like these that were low-level or a bunch of drug heads acting like Satanists.
[00:29:37.547 --> 00:29:45.511]  When I was a teenager, I was actually invited in to the feeding groups in Dallas into a Bavarian Illuminati satanic organization.
[00:29:45.511 --> 00:29:47.552]  So my whole life has been connected to this.
[00:29:48.342 --> 00:29:52.244]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[00:29:52.244 --> 00:30:00.807]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.807 --> 00:30:04.168]  Marco Rubio, Wall Street's boy toy.
[00:30:04.168 --> 00:30:09.750]  He's gotten more money from the elite donors in Wall Street than number two Jeb or even number three Hillary.
[00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:13.472]  After blowing 150 million dollars on Jeb, they still haven't learned anything.
[00:30:15.194 --> 00:30:17.595]  Jeb's dropping out didn't help Rubio in Nevada.
[00:30:17.595 --> 00:30:20.876]  Rubio is the establishment's 20% solution.
[00:30:20.876 --> 00:30:25.437]  Jeb had a sense of entitlement, kind of like the donor class and the party elite that support Rubio.
[00:30:25.437 --> 00:30:29.879]  They believe they can openly oppose the voters on their key issues and still win.
[00:30:29.879 --> 00:30:31.339]  But Rubio is a little smarter.
[00:30:31.759 --> 00:30:37.221]  He realizes that his support for illegal immigration with the Gang of Eight was a betrayal of the voters.
[00:30:37.221 --> 00:30:39.942]  But he still thinks they're too stupid to see through the lies.
[00:30:39.942 --> 00:30:47.845]  He's called Breitbart a conspiracy website and the president of the Ice Union a liar when they exposed Rubio's betrayal with the Gang of Eight.
[00:30:47.845 --> 00:30:55.567]  But Rubio's campaign will provide a useful public service, identifying the GOP political class who will say anything to get elected.
[00:30:55.567 --> 00:30:57.348]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[00:31:00.268 --> 00:31:04.031]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[00:31:04.031 --> 00:31:11.776]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[00:31:11.776 --> 00:31:20.382]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[00:31:20.382 --> 00:31:24.804]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[00:31:24.804 --> 00:31:30.108]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[00:31:30.228 --> 00:31:31.228]  We're good to go.
[00:31:58.593 --> 00:32:02.338]  Tell folks how you got introduced to super male and then when super female came out.
[00:32:02.338 --> 00:32:03.239]  Tell us what happened.
[00:32:03.239 --> 00:32:08.005]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[00:32:08.005 --> 00:32:09.347]  Talk about the effects.
[00:32:09.347 --> 00:32:10.849]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[00:32:10.849 --> 00:32:12.771]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[00:32:12.771 --> 00:32:13.893]  I feel like I look better.
[00:32:13.893 --> 00:32:14.594]  I feel better.
[00:32:14.594 --> 00:32:15.655]  I feel sexier.
[00:32:15.655 --> 00:32:16.376]  I love it.
[00:32:16.616 --> 00:32:19.601]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[00:32:19.601 --> 00:32:22.525]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[00:32:22.525 --> 00:32:23.606]  Check it out for yourself.
[00:32:23.606 --> 00:32:24.808]  Consult your physician.

[00:33:20.577 --> 00:33:24.940]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:29.123]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:33:29.123 --> 00:33:30.744]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:39.962 --> 00:33:42.244]  There was a move to enlighten humanity.
[00:33:42.244 --> 00:33:45.106]  There was a move to empower the individual.
[00:33:45.106 --> 00:33:48.189]  There was a major move for free will.
[00:33:48.189 --> 00:33:49.791]  Led by Christians.
[00:33:49.791 --> 00:33:57.117]  But not the Christians you see in these big establishment churches.
[00:33:57.117 --> 00:34:02.102]  Most of which are run by big, long-tailed devils.
[00:34:02.102 --> 00:34:03.383]  Who know full well what they're part of.
[00:34:04.588 --> 00:34:06.789]  Deceiving you, the profane.
[00:34:06.789 --> 00:34:08.309]  Suppressing you.
[00:34:08.309 --> 00:34:10.690]  Making you slaves.
[00:34:10.690 --> 00:34:12.671]  Well, I'm here to break the chains.
[00:34:12.671 --> 00:34:15.171]  You can break them as well.
[00:34:15.171 --> 00:34:18.672]  I'm here to see the rise of humanity.
[00:34:18.672 --> 00:34:21.573]  I'm here to see us truly empowered.
[00:34:21.573 --> 00:34:23.534]  And the false Illuminati will be broken.
[00:34:24.755 --> 00:34:29.336]  Broken on God's knee and will fall into a trillion pieces.
[00:34:29.336 --> 00:34:37.238]  The wreckage of a twisted system that invaded and suppressed civilization.
[00:34:37.238 --> 00:34:40.739]  Human potential will not be suppressed.
[00:34:40.739 --> 00:34:48.901]  To the stars and beyond, we are coming.
[00:34:48.901 --> 00:34:50.661]  Instead of going to these churches,
[00:34:52.566 --> 00:34:58.131]  You don't need to go into these churches, folks.
[00:34:58.131 --> 00:35:03.196]  Almost all of them are run by the system.
[00:35:03.196 --> 00:35:05.658]  They're men who want to be gods.
[00:35:05.658 --> 00:35:10.142]  High priests that want to have you fall before them.
[00:35:10.142 --> 00:35:12.804]  Instead of fall before God.
[00:35:12.804 --> 00:35:14.766]  And be lifted up by angels.
[00:35:17.529 --> 00:35:19.351]  All right, let's get back to this epic news.
[00:35:19.351 --> 00:35:21.132]  I mean, Washington Post, you name it.
[00:35:21.132 --> 00:35:22.754]  Oh, hey, he was in a secret society.
[00:35:22.754 --> 00:35:24.255]  It's a hunting society.
[00:35:24.255 --> 00:35:26.938]  Yeah, founded in Germany 300-something years ago.
[00:35:26.938 --> 00:35:29.560]  Founded in the Austrian-Hungarian Empire.
[00:35:29.560 --> 00:35:36.767]  Yeah, and sure, there's a place called Bohemian Grove that resurrected it after the Nazis destroyed it in the early 40s.
[00:35:38.473 --> 00:35:43.774]  And yeah, there's black op commanders that get special awards from Obama that are part of it.
[00:35:43.774 --> 00:35:44.774]  Scalia died.
[00:35:44.774 --> 00:35:46.855]  They didn't take him back on the private jet.
[00:35:46.855 --> 00:35:49.295]  There was no security there.
[00:35:49.295 --> 00:35:54.956]  They just wanted to all be alone out there on the 30,000 acres with skulls and demon faces everywhere.
[00:35:54.956 --> 00:35:59.957]  We have the footage of bizarre demons eating little children.
[00:35:59.957 --> 00:36:02.417]  We haven't shown that footage yet for TV viewers.
[00:36:02.417 --> 00:36:05.218]  Radio listeners can go to InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[00:36:08.185 --> 00:36:13.187]  In fact, can we roll some of that footage that actually shows the... Yeah, look at this.
[00:36:13.187 --> 00:36:22.611]  A dead woman with a demon above her in a ritual, and when they pan down, there's little dead children there on the altar.
[00:36:25.014 --> 00:36:27.116]  Yeah, that's not the footage I saw this morning.
[00:36:27.116 --> 00:36:29.097]  That's some shaky, weird footage.
[00:36:29.097 --> 00:36:31.018]  We've got some other good footage I saw back there.
[00:36:31.018 --> 00:36:35.461]  But, you know, our problem is we've just got so much footage of all of this.
[00:36:35.461 --> 00:36:47.770]  And then Joe Biggs Instagrammed out SSG Biggs sitting at the very chair where Scalia sat for dinner that night with all the demon and devil mask behind him.
[00:36:47.770 --> 00:36:54.615]  And then right behind that just is more, you know, endless rooms of bizarre satanic memorabilia.
[00:36:56.866 --> 00:36:59.389]  Isn't that just interesting?
[00:36:59.389 --> 00:37:07.738]  So Scalia, Justice Scalia, spent his last hours with members of the secretive society of elite hunters.
[00:37:07.738 --> 00:37:09.921]  So, okay guys, we got trouble.
[00:37:09.921 --> 00:37:12.043]  The help knows it was a secret society.
[00:37:12.043 --> 00:37:13.725]  The help knows something weird went on.
[00:37:13.725 --> 00:37:14.986]  They got investigators.
[00:37:14.986 --> 00:37:16.828]  There's a federal investigation being launched.
[00:37:17.642 --> 00:37:19.203]  That we told you about first here yesterday.
[00:37:19.203 --> 00:37:20.324]  This is them talking.
[00:37:20.324 --> 00:37:24.588]  We got to go ahead and get ahead of this being a secret society, a Bavarian Illuminati deal.
[00:37:24.588 --> 00:37:25.188]  What do we do?
[00:37:25.188 --> 00:37:33.134]  Well, our feeder groups are hunting clubs, sex clubs, and reading clubs.
[00:37:33.134 --> 00:37:37.738]  And so the front for this is a hunting club.
[00:37:37.738 --> 00:37:40.860]  And so we'll just go ahead and run with that.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:41.401]  And that's what they did.
[00:37:42.844 --> 00:37:57.893]  Because again, the hunting clubs, the hunting secret societies, this is one of the most elite in the world, are the feeders into the real Illuminati, which is why Bohemian Grove, the real Illuminati in the U.S., Skull and Bones created, it was created by the German death cult.
[00:37:57.893 --> 00:38:09.640]  German death cult was the granddaddy that gave birth to Skull and Bones, that was the daddy and the mommy that gave birth to Bohemian Grove, and now Bohemian Grove's grown up, it's over 115 years old, and it's a big boy now, and it's given birth to this!
[00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:14.051]  It's been around for decades.
[00:38:14.051 --> 00:38:18.553]  And they've got these things in Texas, they've got them in Tennessee, they've got them in New York.
[00:38:18.553 --> 00:38:20.374]  You've seen Eyes Wide Shut, folks.
[00:38:20.374 --> 00:38:22.455]  And there's different flavors, different variants.
[00:38:22.455 --> 00:38:26.537]  They worship different goddesses and different gods, but they all lead back to the same thing.
[00:38:26.537 --> 00:38:35.761]  So, it's a big deal to have Scalia die in the middle of a secret society meeting.
[00:38:35.761 --> 00:38:37.362]  Should there be an investigation now?
[00:38:39.721 --> 00:38:44.584]  Well, reportedly, from a good source, there is an investigation, federally, but also privately starting.
[00:38:44.584 --> 00:38:54.130]  So what other revelations are going to be coming out?
[00:38:54.130 --> 00:39:08.079]  Now, continuing, ladies and gentlemen, we are digesting all of this info, and we are going to be breaking it all down here today, coming up at the middle of the next hour.
[00:39:10.592 --> 00:39:19.496]  And we have a special report that I've shot on this subject as well, 15 years ago, that we're going to be re-airing here.
[00:39:19.496 --> 00:39:24.899]  Just a snippet from my film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[00:39:27.386 --> 00:39:31.127]  Now, some will argue and spin this, these are just Mexican masks.
[00:39:31.127 --> 00:39:33.708]  Yeah, from Santeria and Voodoo, folks.
[00:39:33.708 --> 00:39:38.990]  And they have found thousands of dead bodies over the border in that very area of Mexicans sacrificed.
[00:39:38.990 --> 00:39:42.371]  That's even been in Texas Monthly, but it's not even really known.
[00:39:42.371 --> 00:39:44.432]  They don't really make movies about it.
[00:39:44.432 --> 00:39:47.293]  It is so dangerous and dark down there.
[00:39:47.293 --> 00:39:48.894]  Very romantic, very mysterious.
[00:39:50.288 --> 00:39:53.791]  And most of these masks, you notice, are devil masks and demon masks.
[00:39:53.791 --> 00:39:57.014]  There's so many other masks down there.
[00:39:57.014 --> 00:40:05.621]  And, you know, you could decorate a place with all the great Spanish and Mexican culture stuff, but instead, oh, let's just go with devil stuff everywhere.
[00:40:05.621 --> 00:40:16.250]  And then the books, as Kit Daniels points out, are about the fall of civilization, Rome, the Nazis, world government, the Illuminati.
[00:40:16.250 --> 00:40:17.371]  That's what this is all about.
[00:40:19.133 --> 00:40:21.595]  So, that's who really rules this planet.
[00:40:21.595 --> 00:40:23.217]  And they robbed the Renaissance.
[00:40:23.217 --> 00:40:25.819]  They took over the real Illuminati.
[00:40:25.819 --> 00:40:27.320]  You know, Christ, light of the world.
[00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:28.161]  Who's the devil?
[00:40:28.161 --> 00:40:28.901]  The angel of light.
[00:40:28.901 --> 00:40:29.982]  The false light.
[00:40:29.982 --> 00:40:33.025]  Masquerading as God.
[00:40:33.025 --> 00:40:39.851]  And just like Bohemian Grove, they've got the sculptures of the devil murdering women and children and tearing them limb from limb.
[00:40:42.648 --> 00:40:52.797]  And Justice Scalia dies in the middle of this, and they have to admit it was a German-Austrian-Hungarian secret society.
[00:40:52.797 --> 00:40:57.681]  And Joe Biggs says it's like Bohemian Grove 2.0.
[00:40:57.681 --> 00:41:03.226]  Last week, and it is, created by Bohemian Grove, The Washington Post.
[00:41:03.226 --> 00:41:07.530]  Justice Scalia spent his last hours with members of the secretive society of elite hunters.
[00:41:11.584 --> 00:41:13.986]  And now we know who the secretive friend is he traveled with.
[00:41:13.986 --> 00:41:21.591]  And there's jets on the tarmac ready to get him out.
[00:41:21.591 --> 00:41:22.431]  And they didn't.
[00:41:22.431 --> 00:41:25.093]  They drove him out and made sure there was no autopsy.
[00:41:25.093 --> 00:41:26.033]  Daily Mail.
[00:41:26.033 --> 00:41:35.680]  Justice Scalia spent his final hours in the company of a secret society of hunters that has existed since the 1600s.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:38.442]  As a researcher and a top expert, top expert on this,
[00:41:39.565 --> 00:41:45.710]  I've infiltrated one of these events and I was attempted to be inducted into it as a teenager repeatedly.
[00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:48.292]  I mean, I'm talking 20 bedroom mansions and stuff, okay?
[00:41:48.292 --> 00:41:52.596]  I'm not talking about some crackhead over here acting like they're a Satanist.
[00:41:52.596 --> 00:41:56.158]  Or somebody wearing a pentagram, you know, around their neck in a rock band wanting power.
[00:41:56.158 --> 00:42:01.182]  They think the devil gave them power when God gave them that talent.
[00:42:01.182 --> 00:42:04.165]  The devil's trick is he gives you confidence that you already had.
[00:42:07.571 --> 00:42:19.774]  And let me tell you, you get into powerful circles of people, most of them are into the occult, and most of them think the devil gave them their success.
[00:42:19.774 --> 00:42:24.215]  I'll tell you this.
[00:42:24.215 --> 00:42:29.136]  I'd give it over a 90% chance, about a 90% chance that Scalia met with foul play.
[00:42:29.136 --> 00:42:30.536]  A 100% chance there's a cover-up.
[00:42:31.578 --> 00:42:49.032]  But I've gone from a 98% chance that was foul play to... You got a little bit of heart problems, you're overweight, you take Viagra... You're down there by yourself on Valentine's Day... And you die of a heart attack, and then they don't know what to do, and it's the middle of a big party...
[00:42:49.978 --> 00:42:53.220]  And then let's just get his body over here to a county we control.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:54.620]  Let's not put him back on a jet.
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:56.241]  Get to D.C.
[00:42:56.241 --> 00:43:01.884]  and of the different federal hospitals there are going to do an autopsy because they've done it with Ron Brown and a bullet in his head.
[00:43:01.884 --> 00:43:03.005]  They've got good people in the government.
[00:43:03.005 --> 00:43:04.745]  They said Pat Tillman was murdered.
[00:43:04.745 --> 00:43:06.826]  The army colonel that did the autopsy.
[00:43:06.826 --> 00:43:09.468]  There are a lot of good people in our government.
[00:43:09.468 --> 00:43:17.612]  I gotta say, I used to bash the government all day, but at professional level, at the military brass level, and they're more informed and care more than the general public.
[00:43:18.404 --> 00:43:21.485]  That's why I don't want to be enemies with the Feds.
[00:43:21.485 --> 00:43:24.125]  Because a lot of them are some of the best people there are.
[00:43:24.125 --> 00:43:26.206]  And they don't want the Feds getting them.
[00:43:26.206 --> 00:43:31.887]  They sent him 300 plus miles to have his blood drained, and to embalm him, and then ship him back.
[00:43:31.887 --> 00:43:34.327]  It was all done secretively.
[00:43:34.327 --> 00:43:37.088]  Should he die like Errol Flynn?
[00:43:37.088 --> 00:43:42.809]  In the saddle?
[00:43:42.809 --> 00:43:43.449]  Or was he murdered?
[00:43:45.413 --> 00:43:49.674]  It's a 99% chance he either died in the saddle or was murdered.
[00:43:49.674 --> 00:43:52.615]  Now that's a criminology prime projection.
[00:43:52.615 --> 00:43:54.756]  And I'm not bragging, folks, but I've proven it.
[00:43:54.756 --> 00:43:56.256]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:43:56.256 --> 00:43:57.657]  Notice I'm right in the middle of it.
[00:43:57.657 --> 00:43:59.838]  I'm the one guy to infiltrate Bohemian Grove.
[00:43:59.838 --> 00:44:00.618]  Did it again.
[00:44:00.618 --> 00:44:03.159]  Told History Channel they were being set up.
[00:44:03.159 --> 00:44:04.479]  History Channel got arrested.
[00:44:04.479 --> 00:44:08.940]  I didn't.
[00:44:08.940 --> 00:44:09.781]  I'm not bragging.
[00:44:09.781 --> 00:44:10.701]  I know what I'm talking about.
[00:44:12.432 --> 00:44:23.836]  We come out, we say it looks like it's a cultic, we're investigating, it looks like Bohemian Grove, boom, it is a Bohemian Grove satellite.
[00:44:23.836 --> 00:44:27.218]  There is a cover-up, there must be an investigation, the question is who does it?
[00:44:27.218 --> 00:44:28.458]  So we're proven right again.
[00:44:28.458 --> 00:44:30.919]  Just like I told you Saturday, watch, I bet there's not an autopsy.
[00:44:30.919 --> 00:44:32.700]  Wasn't an autopsy.
[00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:33.920]  The law flouted.
[00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.461]  The law ignored.
[00:44:35.461 --> 00:44:38.662]  What else do I have to be right about before people start listening to what we're saying?
[00:44:41.317 --> 00:44:46.401]  This is a Bavarian Illuminati cult.
[00:44:46.401 --> 00:44:49.864]  It is the dominant cult in our government, and I've explained this.
[00:44:49.864 --> 00:44:54.808]  And the Nazis get so mad at me out there, that's why they attack me more than Benjamin Netanyahu.
[00:44:54.808 --> 00:45:03.376]  You go to all the major Nazi sites, I am the number one hated by the Nazis, and the number one hated by the Southern Poverty Law Center, and one of the top hated by the ADL.
[00:45:03.376 --> 00:45:05.638]  Why does the left-wing Jewish group hate me?
[00:45:05.638 --> 00:45:09.321]  Why does the foundation-run, offshore-run Southern Poverty Law Center hate me?
[00:45:10.834 --> 00:45:12.656]  Why do the white supremacists hate me so much?
[00:45:12.656 --> 00:45:17.641]  Because they're all run by the same people to create a racist dialectic.
[00:45:17.641 --> 00:45:25.048]  Let me tell you, when you get up to the highest levels of Hollywood or corporate world, they're not worshipping the Talmud, even if they're Jewish, and a lot of them are Jewish.
[00:45:25.048 --> 00:45:29.152]  They're not worshipping, you know, Jesus if they're Catholic.
[00:45:29.152 --> 00:45:33.557]  They're not... If they're Muslims, they're not following Muhammad.
[00:45:34.667 --> 00:45:45.317]  Whether it's the Saudi royalty or whether it's the liberal elites or the royal family of England, they are worshipping Lucifer the Morning Star.
[00:45:45.317 --> 00:45:57.048]  He's the god of this world.
[00:45:57.048 --> 00:45:59.410]  And so the Supreme Court Justice at the key time died.
[00:46:01.561 --> 00:46:06.848]  And they say he's an officer in the group in an Illuminati meeting.
[00:46:06.848 --> 00:46:11.013]  Now, let's be clear.
[00:46:11.013 --> 00:46:19.363]  Scalia did a lot of good things, he did some bad things, and most people in a pyramidal or compartmentalized cult structure do not get into
[00:46:22.406 --> 00:46:24.187]  The Ninth Circle.
[00:46:24.187 --> 00:46:28.229]  You may have heard of that from Dante, but they have six, seven, eight, or nine circles.
[00:46:28.229 --> 00:46:31.611]  Then they have circles within the final circle of compartmentalization.
[00:46:31.611 --> 00:46:40.355]  These are the original intelligence networks.
[00:46:40.355 --> 00:46:42.196]  And so most people are inducted.
[00:46:42.196 --> 00:46:43.977]  Hey, it's a hunting lodge.
[00:46:43.977 --> 00:46:45.978]  In fact, they talk about the most moral.
[00:46:45.978 --> 00:46:48.539]  You induct them into a hunting lodge or you induct them into
[00:46:50.299 --> 00:46:57.885]  They had Christian organizations that were fronts, that were going to help the poor, and that way you control everybody, get their money, have them under your control, you can watch them.
[00:46:57.885 --> 00:47:04.631]  And the Illuminati papers talk about this, Adam Weishaupt, about we must get all the moral men, we must get the best people.
[00:47:04.631 --> 00:47:15.260]  And so, there's a very good chance Scalia was out there as part of just the corporate minutes of this hunting ancient society that was re-founded by Bohemian Grove.
[00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:20.234]  And that someone was brought in and he was taken out.
[00:47:20.234 --> 00:47:24.941]  That's the prime analysis and where it's all pointed right now.
[00:47:24.941 --> 00:47:31.469]  There's a secondary chance that there was other hanky-panky going on, other weirdness going on with other people, so they didn't want an investigation when he had a heart attack.
[00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:32.891]  And then it was natural.
[00:47:32.891 --> 00:47:34.612]  That's a very small probability.
[00:47:34.612 --> 00:47:40.137]  And then there's another probability that, uh, you know, he was, uh, exercising himself in the bed.
[00:47:40.137 --> 00:47:40.998]  We'll just leave it at that.
[00:47:40.998 --> 00:47:50.107]  And, you know, obviously at his age, 79, taking something to stimulate that, that they warn you at that age, don't take Cialis or, or, or Viagra to make you have a heart attack and die.
[00:47:50.107 --> 00:47:50.647]  In some cases.
[00:47:51.721 --> 00:47:58.144]  And that's the investigation for the FBI and everybody else, which I know you guys already know about all this, but that's what's going on.
[00:47:58.144 --> 00:48:06.468]  And are you going to let a Supreme Court justice die inside an Illuminati compound with a black op commander running the whole thing that hangs out with Obama at a key point?
[00:48:06.468 --> 00:48:11.811]  I mean, with no autopsy and the pillow on the face and all the rest of it and all the story changing dozens of times now.
[00:48:11.811 --> 00:48:15.352]  And again, there is an investigation.
[00:48:15.352 --> 00:48:16.113]  You heard it from Larry Nichols.
[00:48:18.257 --> 00:48:25.942]  That's why this is all coming out because they want to put it out how they're going to put it out first to control it and spin it.
[00:48:25.942 --> 00:48:38.249]  We come back even bigger news and I'm going to do the next half hour on this and then get back into the Illuminati because you need to know what really governs you and what is trying to get full control.
[00:48:38.249 --> 00:48:40.310]  New York Times columnist jokes about assassinating a
[00:48:41.411 --> 00:48:44.852]  New York Times columnist jokes about assassination attempt ending Trump's campaign.
[00:48:44.852 --> 00:48:49.053]  He says, good news guys, I've figured out how the Trump campaign ends.
[00:48:49.053 --> 00:48:55.914]  And this wouldn't have been done by Ross Duvett if he hadn't been authorized, you can bet your bottom biscuits.
[00:48:55.914 --> 00:48:59.735]  So we're going to break that down coming up.
[00:48:59.735 --> 00:49:03.676]  If you want Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, it's a two-film CD.
[00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:06.551]  and The Order of Death.
[00:49:06.551 --> 00:49:11.995]  Alex Jones has blown Bohemian Grove wide open, John Sargent, World of Wonder, Channel 4, UK.
[00:49:11.995 --> 00:49:12.975]  You can get the two films.
[00:49:12.975 --> 00:49:17.678]  The one I made 15 years ago, 16 years ago, right after I came out.
[00:49:17.678 --> 00:49:19.199]  I made it about a month so they wouldn't kill me.
[00:49:19.199 --> 00:49:22.141]  I mean, we had break-ins, death threats, robberies, you know.
[00:49:22.141 --> 00:49:23.822]  I mean, they came after us for this.
[00:49:23.822 --> 00:49:25.963]  They got real mad.
[00:49:25.963 --> 00:49:31.587]  And then, about five, six years later, I did an update, The Order of Death.
[00:49:31.587 --> 00:49:32.868]  It's an even more powerful film.
[00:49:35.273 --> 00:49:37.655]  Our entire society is ruled and controlled by deep occultists.
[00:49:37.655 --> 00:49:38.835]  Director Alex Jones.

[00:50:00.589 --> 00:50:00.989]  Whatever.
[00:50:02.557 --> 00:50:08.903]  It doesn't even look real when we're at 5.0, so it's good the trolls go and do their fraudulent reviews because it drives stuff down to 4.8 and stuff.
[00:50:08.903 --> 00:50:09.544]  It's more believable.
[00:50:11.010 --> 00:50:14.694]  Anyways, I'm not being arrogant, I'm just risking my life here, so I'm going up against these people.

[00:53:28.750 --> 00:53:34.894]  This man has received national attention for accurately predicting every major financial trend, including the market crash of 2008.
[00:53:34.894 --> 00:53:45.060]  His name is Harry Dent, and in his newly released book, he is making even bigger and bolder predictions that have the potential to devastate the world economy and your personal wealth.
[00:53:45.060 --> 00:53:53.906]  You can get a free copy of Harry Dent's bestseller, The Demographic Cliff, containing never-before-published information by simply visiting www.HarryDentResearch.com.
[00:53:53.906 --> 00:53:56.988]  Again, that's www.HarryDentResearch.com.
[00:54:37.244 --> 00:54:45.550]  I was literally just out there writing an article with Kit Daniels, working with him on it.
[00:54:45.550 --> 00:54:53.115]  And Kit's a smart guy, Paul Watson's a smart guy, so if they don't completely understand what I'm saying, I just did a voice memo for them so they can transcribe it.
[00:54:53.115 --> 00:54:59.180]  I'm going to do that again and then get into Trump.
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:06.165]  This is the short, condensed Reader's Digest version of the Illuminati, which you can even find in Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:55:07.691 --> 00:55:27.836]  There was a major renaissance world movement taking place in Europe and the colonies after 200 plus years of the building renaissance that was unseating the Catholic Church and its monopolies as well as royalty across Europe as well as England and Scotland.
[00:55:27.836 --> 00:55:35.278]  A Jesuit by training, Professor Adam Weishaupt at Ingolstadt University then developed
[00:55:36.434 --> 00:56:00.119]  His own counter-populist movement that was not meant to overthrow the monarchies or overthrow the church, but to actually overthrow the Renaissance in the name of overthrowing the royalty and the church, to then establish a total world dictatorship that was Luciferian in nature.
[00:56:06.038 --> 00:56:19.850]  George Washington, in his famous letters against the Illuminati, points all of this out and says that the French Revolution is super bad news and is meant to create total tyranny and that needs to be resisted.
[00:56:19.850 --> 00:56:32.561]  So, simply put, it is a false, political, populist movement designed to basically say all the right things, come in and take over the Renaissance,
[00:56:33.820 --> 00:56:40.544]  Take over civilization and society and establish tyranny.
[00:56:40.544 --> 00:56:53.431]  When the police raided the Illuminati after one of their letter carriers was struck by lightning and they found whole dossiers going to France and other countries and Italy on how to run these operations, the Illuminati was broken up in Germany for a time.
[00:56:53.431 --> 00:57:02.837]  It moved in 1832 to Yale with the Russell Trust, giving it millions of dollars to establish the organization at Yale and to try to take the United States over.
[00:57:04.693 --> 00:57:06.995]  Skull and Bones was founded.
[00:57:06.995 --> 00:57:12.760]  Skull and Bones took over a popular hunting lodge north of San Francisco that Mark Twain was a part of.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.622]  They kicked them out.
[00:57:14.622 --> 00:57:15.503]  Close to 1900.
[00:57:15.503 --> 00:57:31.697]  And Howard Taft and others that were members of Skull and Bones went to Bohemian Grove and set it up as a party palace to induct other powerful men and robber barons and royalty to get them to join their death cult.
[00:57:33.832 --> 00:57:51.768]  It has since set up satellite organizations across the United States and they now admit in the Washington Post that it was a satellite organization set up in the 60s reviving a particular order, a hunting order that was a front then as well, with Scalia as an officer in it.
[00:57:52.853 --> 00:57:56.736]  And established a Bohemian Grove satellite in Texas.
[00:57:56.736 --> 00:57:59.398]  And as we've told you, there are other satellites around the country.
[00:57:59.398 --> 00:58:01.280]  So, that's what this is.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:02.381]  That's what's happening.
[00:58:02.381 --> 00:58:05.544]  And when we say secret society, it means a private intelligence network.
[00:58:06.377 --> 00:58:10.198]  They have their own courts, their own trials, their own systems.
[00:58:10.198 --> 00:58:13.359]  They copy the masons, but they are not the masons.
[00:58:13.359 --> 00:58:28.723]  They have taken the masons over in many areas because it's compartmentalized, and the porch masons or the profane masons don't know they're being given a different teaching than one of the more ancient Solomon-based or Egyptian-based Masonic systems.
[00:58:28.723 --> 00:58:34.865]  But the real system that modified this and created the Renaissance would be the ancient Christian order.
[00:58:36.323 --> 00:58:40.465]  Stay with us, we'll be back.

[01:00:02.843 --> 01:00:06.123]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:06.123 --> 01:00:08.304]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:10.344]  Do you think I'd ever care?
[01:00:24.927 --> 01:00:32.909]  New York Times columnist jokes about assassination attempt ending Trump's campaign.
[01:00:32.909 --> 01:00:34.909]  Good guys news.
[01:00:34.909 --> 01:00:36.189]  Good news guys.
[01:00:36.189 --> 01:00:41.291]  I figured out how the Trump campaign ends.
[01:00:41.291 --> 01:00:47.492]  And our story is linked up on DrudgeReport.com at the top.
[01:00:48.513 --> 01:00:52.135]  Tonight, Cruz, Rubio, fight over scraps.
[01:00:52.135 --> 01:01:00.539]  We're going to have live coverage, and I'll be part of it as well, with expanded InfoWars Nightly News.
[01:01:00.539 --> 01:01:06.201]  And our crew does such an amazing job breaking all this down.
[01:01:06.201 --> 01:01:13.805]  And we come back in the next segment, I'm going to read the article about the call for Trump's death, and why this is so important.
[01:01:13.805 --> 01:01:17.547]  Paul's doing other reports on, and others are doing reports on, all the tweets out there
[01:01:19.415 --> 01:01:24.419]  Supporting Trump being killed?
[01:01:24.419 --> 01:01:27.922]  That's putting the idea out there so somebody tries it.
[01:01:27.922 --> 01:01:34.327]  And then the media likens Trump to someone that'll hold a baby up in front of the reported shooter.
[01:01:34.327 --> 01:01:38.350]  We're going to play video of that as well.
[01:01:38.350 --> 01:01:40.512]  But that story is up on InfoWars.com.
[01:01:45.589 --> 01:01:49.391]  There's also another report, 45% of Americans pay no federal income tax.
[01:01:49.391 --> 01:02:05.560]  They've done it that way so that for the middle class, who pays 45%, and the elite who basically exempt themselves, well the elite are exempt, the general public's exempt, and so they sit around going, I want more, I want socialism, yeah I'm not paying for it.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:09.603]  That's only going to happen until the globalists consolidate everything and condition everyone to be slaves.
[01:02:10.865 --> 01:02:16.227]  So when Mitt Romney said 47% of people, 48% of people don't matter because they're already paid off, they don't care.
[01:02:16.227 --> 01:02:17.408]  That's true.
[01:02:17.408 --> 01:02:19.248]  It's very, very immoral.
[01:02:19.248 --> 01:02:21.469]  They've been bought off.
[01:02:21.469 --> 01:02:22.170]  And they want more.
[01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:23.870]  Now they want free tuition.
[01:02:23.870 --> 01:02:24.831]  Now they want free healthcare.
[01:02:24.831 --> 01:02:28.072]  And of course they'll never get it.
[01:02:28.072 --> 01:02:30.393]  We're going into the collapse in the next few years.
[01:02:30.393 --> 01:02:33.514]  It's already here in most parts of the world.
[01:02:33.514 --> 01:02:34.815]  But we're gonna go to break, come back.
[01:02:35.888 --> 01:02:37.568]  And really, really burrow into this.
[01:02:37.568 --> 01:02:42.510]  I mean, I got so upset over Scalia being in a secret society and turning out it's the Illuminati.
[01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:44.530]  I mean, that's what it is, on record.
[01:02:44.530 --> 01:02:49.191]  I mean, I've got books that sell for like $800 apiece that are the internal annals of Bohemian Grove.
[01:02:49.191 --> 01:02:51.792]  Widows mail them to me when their husbands die.
[01:02:51.792 --> 01:02:54.953]  It's only like 1,500 members.
[01:02:54.953 --> 01:02:59.234]  And it's all, we trace ourselves, the Bavarian Illuminati, blah, blah, blah.
[01:02:59.234 --> 01:03:01.515]  German chancellors like Helmut Schmidt have written books.
[01:03:01.515 --> 01:03:02.815]  This is not my opinion.
[01:03:05.552 --> 01:03:06.633]  Oh, look at the next headline.
[01:03:06.633 --> 01:03:08.234]  Babies made without men.
[01:03:08.234 --> 01:03:10.976]  See how we're entering this world?
[01:03:10.976 --> 01:03:21.124]  We're going to get to all of it coming up today, but briefly because I only plugged once last hour and even skipped a break.
[01:03:21.124 --> 01:03:25.927]  It is so important that people support GCNlive.com and the sponsors that GCN has.
[01:03:25.927 --> 01:03:32.632]  It doesn't mean I vet them all or I support them all, because I have to be on the air with other sponsors and other ads that I haven't vetted.
[01:03:32.632 --> 01:03:33.293]  I'm just saying that.
[01:03:36.061 --> 01:03:46.829]  And vice versa, Ted, gets to be on air with my sponsors, which are pretty much just our products, so I can control everything and try to have 100% good mojo and just absolutely feel so good when I sell you something.
[01:03:46.829 --> 01:04:00.259]  Whether it's a water filtration system or non-GMO seeds or a Hillary for Prison shirt or nutraceuticals, I mean, I really want you to have the very best products so you keep buying them, but I never was like that early on.
[01:04:00.259 --> 01:04:05.243]  I really want people to have the best products because that's how I want to be treated, but it turns out that works really good because folks then really keep buying them.
[01:04:06.618 --> 01:04:11.559]  See, globalists do evil things, not because it even helps them, but because they're evil in nature.
[01:04:11.559 --> 01:04:12.460]  But I digress.
[01:04:12.460 --> 01:04:16.121]  You really should try Survival Shield X2 and see if you're iodine deficient.
[01:04:16.121 --> 01:04:18.081]  You'll find out in about three weeks to a month.
[01:04:18.081 --> 01:04:21.462]  You really should do the liver cleanse and the oxy powder gallbladder cleanse.
[01:04:21.462 --> 01:04:23.142]  It'll blow you away.
[01:04:23.142 --> 01:04:24.483]  Read the reviews.
[01:04:24.483 --> 01:04:25.123]  You really should.
[01:04:26.912 --> 01:04:30.014]  Get Super Female Vitality, Super Female Vitality, sold out.

[01:04:39.681 --> 01:04:46.605]  So one way to get around ever being, you know, sold out and not be able to get something for two, three months is to be signed up for AutoShip.
[01:04:46.605 --> 01:04:49.267]  And we got a high tech, super safe shopping cart.

[01:04:55.591 --> 01:04:56.432]  They want to kill Trump.
[01:05:01.994 --> 01:05:02.875]  Hey, what's going on?
[01:05:02.875 --> 01:05:04.556]  This is Joe Biggs with Infowars.com.
[01:05:04.556 --> 01:05:06.316]  What are you guys doing this Thursday?
[01:05:06.316 --> 01:05:07.717]  Probably nothing.
[01:05:07.717 --> 01:05:15.321]  You're gonna get off work, sit down, go through your TV channels, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, definitely a no.
[01:05:15.321 --> 01:05:18.262]  Watching Dung Beetles on Discovery Channel, negative.
[01:05:18.522 --> 01:05:27.328]  Get your laptop, hook it up to your TV, and go to InfoWars.com forward slash show and watch this Thursday's live GOP debate coverage.
[01:05:27.328 --> 01:05:31.731]  Watch as we smash through the lies and disinformation in real time.
[01:05:31.731 --> 01:05:38.496]  You'll see people like Leigh Ann McAdoo, Jakari Jackson, and David Knight break everything down for you.
[01:05:38.496 --> 01:05:40.958]  The GOP debate shouldn't be something that's boring.
[01:05:40.958 --> 01:05:43.300]  It should be fun for you and all your friends and family.
[01:05:43.300 --> 01:05:43.560]  Haha!
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:45.923]  Also get some popcorn, sit down and enjoy.
[01:05:45.923 --> 01:05:55.076]  Make sure you join us this Thursday, February 25th, 2016 at 7pm Central Standard Time as we break down everything that's happening with the GOP debate.
[01:05:58.592 --> 01:05:59.533]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:05:59.533 --> 01:06:00.094]  Good, brother.
[01:06:00.094 --> 01:06:02.056]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:06:02.056 --> 01:06:03.778]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:06:03.778 --> 01:06:07.842]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:06:07.842 --> 01:06:08.563]  Well, thank you, brother.
[01:06:08.563 --> 01:06:12.847]  It's because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:06:12.847 --> 01:06:20.696]  SuperMill Vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.

[01:06:24.258 --> 01:06:25.799]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:06:25.799 --> 01:06:28.721]  We've gotten off of the cheap energy drinks, energy shots.
[01:06:28.721 --> 01:06:30.482]  Saving a ton of money there.
[01:06:30.482 --> 01:06:36.285]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated.
[01:06:36.545 --> 01:06:38.326]  Or maximum potency.
[01:06:38.326 --> 01:06:48.528]  They want to stun and dumb down and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while, but then burn you out in my experience, whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going, goes right to the source.
[01:06:48.528 --> 01:06:50.329]  So, it's pretty exciting and I love it.

[01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:34.642]  Instead of buying five, six, or even seven different cleansing products, we use decades-old scientific research to put together the Rolls-Royce of all-in-one cleansing.
[01:07:34.642 --> 01:07:41.724]  Look, there's a reason Deep Cleanse is the only product on the market that uses our proprietary SpiteGerex herbal processing technique.
[01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:47.085]  We use only the highest quality organic herbs backed by serious research, and we still bring it to you at the best
[01:07:47.225 --> 01:07:51.988]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:07:51.988 --> 01:07:54.149]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:21.155 --> 01:08:21.835]  Think about this.
[01:08:21.835 --> 01:08:23.496]  It's so important.
[01:08:23.496 --> 01:08:25.077]  It illustrates everything.
[01:08:25.077 --> 01:08:27.858]  The president says Trump is ineligible.
[01:08:27.858 --> 01:08:35.462]  He's disqualified because the president is God and tells you what you can and can't have here in this free country.
[01:08:35.462 --> 01:08:40.385]  They tell you Trump is racist because he wants a border that every other country has.
[01:08:40.385 --> 01:08:47.448]  They say he's evil and horrible because he doesn't want to bring jihadis in with undocumented refugees who don't even have their passports looked at.
[01:08:47.448 --> 01:08:48.409]  That's on record.
[01:08:50.285 --> 01:09:00.070]  The Communist Chinese government came out last night and said, do not elect Donald Trump because he says he won't let us keep lowering our currency, which is a tariff against the U.S.
[01:09:00.070 --> 01:09:01.291]  We don't have tariffs on them.
[01:09:01.291 --> 01:09:02.691]  They have them on us.
[01:09:02.691 --> 01:09:05.673]  He just says you can't screw us.
[01:09:05.673 --> 01:09:08.414]  Hundreds of container ships a week come in on the West Coast.
[01:09:08.414 --> 01:09:09.335]  There have been periods.
[01:09:09.335 --> 01:09:11.836]  David Knight did a powerful piece on this last night.
[01:09:15.868 --> 01:09:23.071]  Where not one container ship goes between the United States and Europe and Russia in the Atlantic.
[01:09:23.071 --> 01:09:26.033]  There are government websites that show the container ships going back and forth.
[01:09:26.033 --> 01:09:29.534]  There are long periods now when nothing goes back and forth.
[01:09:29.534 --> 01:09:31.635]  It's dead.
[01:09:31.635 --> 01:09:36.397]  Because China lowers prices, lowers standards, has no environmental controls.
[01:09:36.397 --> 01:09:40.819]  Our governments pile them on us and then all trade goes to them.
[01:09:40.819 --> 01:09:41.720]  And then we're checkmated.
[01:09:45.458 --> 01:09:50.762]  We are unable to take care of ourselves.
[01:09:50.762 --> 01:09:56.826]  Now, let's think about it.
[01:09:56.826 --> 01:09:58.928]  The Communist Chinese hate him.
[01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:00.689]  The Socialist Pope hates him.
[01:10:00.689 --> 01:10:02.030]  The Democrats hate him.
[01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:05.373]  Foreign TV stations Univision hate him.
[01:10:05.373 --> 01:10:08.155]  The Republican Party says we can't have him.
[01:10:08.155 --> 01:10:09.816]  The insider Bushes say we can't have him.
[01:10:09.816 --> 01:10:11.037]  The Clintons say we can't have him.
[01:10:13.126 --> 01:10:14.167]  Fox hates him.
[01:10:14.167 --> 01:10:15.428]  CNN hates him.
[01:10:15.428 --> 01:10:17.931]  MSNBC hates him.
[01:10:17.931 --> 01:10:20.313]  The whole world system hates him.
[01:10:20.313 --> 01:10:26.158]  The Federal Reserve has come out and doesn't like him.
[01:10:26.158 --> 01:10:31.704]  Because whatever they know about Donald Trump, it scares the living daylights out of them.
[01:10:31.704 --> 01:10:37.089]  And some people see wheels within wheels, and they're certainly there, and they say Donald Trump
[01:10:38.353 --> 01:10:45.698]  Could be the ultimate fake populist and they are running him and letting him say all this knowing it'll make him get elected.
[01:10:45.698 --> 01:10:47.519]  They've never behaved like that before.
[01:10:47.519 --> 01:10:50.080]  They've never brought out that the Federal Reserve should be audited.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.082]  They've never brought out 9-11 truth 28 pages.
[01:10:53.082 --> 01:10:59.546]  They've never said we should control our borders, both big parties.
[01:10:59.546 --> 01:11:03.269]  What he's doing is changing the political landscape
[01:11:04.423 --> 01:11:08.807]  And basically blowing a hole in the side of their ship of lies.
[01:11:08.807 --> 01:11:10.129]  So water pours in.
[01:11:10.129 --> 01:11:10.949]  So truth comes in.
[01:11:10.949 --> 01:11:13.372]  They're already sinking.
[01:11:13.372 --> 01:11:20.238]  And they've already taken hundreds of millions of dollars away from him with his companies and TV shows and hotels.
[01:11:20.238 --> 01:11:24.563]  They're already hurting him financially.
[01:11:24.563 --> 01:11:26.865]  He's committed to this fight.
[01:11:31.072 --> 01:11:36.114]  And if he ends up being a Benedict Arnold, he will be the most hated person in U.S.
[01:11:36.114 --> 01:11:37.894]  history and will be anathema.
[01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:42.636]  Because it's one thing to be a sleazy politician, then get in and screw people over.
[01:11:42.636 --> 01:11:48.298]  It's another thing to claim you are the mantle of the champion of populism.
[01:11:48.298 --> 01:11:51.859]  And he's doing this with conservatives, veterans, libertarians, and true Christians.
[01:11:51.859 --> 01:11:57.561]  We're not dumb liberals who don't care as long as our cult leader's in.
[01:11:57.561 --> 01:11:58.762]  Trump knows full well
[01:12:02.196 --> 01:12:04.177]  That it's over for him if he doesn't deliver.
[01:12:04.177 --> 01:12:05.757]  And he knows his whole life is on the line.
[01:12:05.757 --> 01:12:07.097]  He said, I don't care about money.
[01:12:07.097 --> 01:12:08.918]  I don't care about the future.
[01:12:08.918 --> 01:12:15.179]  He said, I'll basically have to retire if I don't win this.
[01:12:15.179 --> 01:12:23.521]  He is completely and totally on the line.
[01:12:23.521 --> 01:12:27.923]  And I've said over and over again, and now a political scientist is coming out saying he's got a 97% chance of winning.
[01:12:30.080 --> 01:12:32.002]  He lost 200 to 1 odds that he'd lose.
[01:12:32.002 --> 01:12:39.869]  Now the odds are he's gonna win, and the top British bookmakers, Vegas is now saying, a shoo-in.
[01:12:39.869 --> 01:12:48.857]  And I said over and over again, I believe that they will try to kill him, if they can wind up a crazy, like they did Reagan, and pray for Donald Trump.
[01:12:48.857 --> 01:12:55.743]  And they had all the White House-run Media Matters groups and others come out, and CNN and everybody, and say, Jones is crazy!
[01:12:56.707 --> 01:12:58.688]  He says that they'll try to kill Trump.
[01:12:58.688 --> 01:13:03.131]  Oh, there's never been political assassination when somebody goes up against the system in world history.
[01:13:03.131 --> 01:13:03.371]  Really?
[01:13:03.371 --> 01:13:13.296]  It's like saying there's never been blue sky.
[01:13:13.296 --> 01:13:14.757]  So they're scared.
[01:13:14.757 --> 01:13:23.082]  And they're really scared of 45% in the exit polls of people identifying as Hispanic
[01:13:24.688 --> 01:13:26.711]  Voted for Donald Trump.
[01:13:26.711 --> 01:13:27.833]  Notice he won by 45.9.
[01:13:27.833 --> 01:13:34.903]  And the exit polls were almost 46 as well.
[01:13:34.903 --> 01:13:37.988]  Because they're just Americans like everybody else that are fed up and sick of it.
[01:13:41.374 --> 01:13:43.275]  That's another big hoax, like Gallup.
[01:13:43.275 --> 01:13:44.896]  They've had two different polls.
[01:13:44.896 --> 01:13:47.578]  70 plus percent of Hispanic Americans don't want open borders.
[01:13:47.578 --> 01:13:48.739]  Really, I wonder why.
[01:13:48.739 --> 01:13:52.041]  Maybe they know Mexico's a living hell in many areas.
[01:13:52.041 --> 01:13:56.744]  Beautiful country, great people, never got out from under colonialism.
[01:13:56.744 --> 01:14:02.047]  What you think they got out from under it was Santa Ana, a dictator?
[01:14:02.047 --> 01:14:05.449]  There were more than 20 rebellions in Mexico against Santa Ana until he was overthrown.
[01:14:05.449 --> 01:14:06.850]  He lost Guatemala.
[01:14:06.850 --> 01:14:09.572]  They claim it's racist that Texas seceded?
[01:14:10.774 --> 01:14:12.735]  A third of the people in the revolution were Hispanic.
[01:14:12.735 --> 01:14:14.756]  The guy that wrote the Constitution, Navarro.
[01:14:14.756 --> 01:14:16.797]  What was it?
[01:14:16.797 --> 01:14:19.618]  Five of the fourteen founding fathers were Hispanic?
[01:14:19.618 --> 01:14:20.719]  They wanted their own land.
[01:14:20.719 --> 01:14:21.820]  They wanted their own property.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.480]  They wanted to be able to have guns.
[01:14:23.480 --> 01:14:27.502]  Did racial politics come in later and push Hispanics out of areas and steal land from them?
[01:14:27.502 --> 01:14:28.203]  Absolutely.
[01:14:28.203 --> 01:14:29.263]  That's how gangs work.
[01:14:29.263 --> 01:14:32.405]  And it's wrong.
[01:14:32.405 --> 01:14:37.647]  But the point is, they're lying about Trump when they're saying he wants to hurt Hispanics.
[01:14:37.647 --> 01:14:38.608]  That's a load of baloney.
[01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:47.026]  Let me tell you, you get rid of China's tariffs, we'll have jobs here again in this country.
[01:14:47.026 --> 01:14:51.990]  We got foreign governments, the Pope, the President, all in one week!
[01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:57.516]  It was last Thursday the Pope came out, and it was China yesterday, so in one week we've had the President,
[01:14:59.574 --> 01:15:05.382]  The Pope and the Communist Chinese President come out and threaten the American people about Donald Trump.
[01:15:05.382 --> 01:15:11.449]  I'm going to tell the Communist Chinese that perch on top of a billion, 300 million hard-working people that you've enslaved.
[01:15:11.449 --> 01:15:13.272]  And they don't even get wealth out of all the stuff you've done.
[01:15:14.872 --> 01:15:17.755]  And all the millions of little girl babies you've killed.
[01:15:17.755 --> 01:15:18.976]  You don't tell us what to do.
[01:15:18.976 --> 01:15:23.781]  And you stop trying to censor our TV and our movies and our print and Michael Savage's book.
[01:15:23.781 --> 01:15:30.207]  You crawl right back in your Mao Zedong, you know-what-hole, and get out of my face, trash!
[01:15:30.207 --> 01:15:32.430]  You blood-sucking maggots!
[01:15:32.430 --> 01:15:35.513]  And that goes for the Pope and Obama and everybody else!
[01:15:35.513 --> 01:15:37.595]  You don't tell us who we can vote for!
[01:15:37.595 --> 01:15:38.536]  You don't threaten us!
[01:15:43.786 --> 01:15:48.428]  That's why it's gonna backfire with, quote, minorities, Hispanics and blacks and others.
[01:15:48.428 --> 01:15:51.730]  Because they know they're getting the shaft, we're all getting the shaft, we're all under attack.
[01:15:51.730 --> 01:15:57.373]  It's time to get past race, all this garbage, and it's time to get down to nationalism.
[01:15:57.373 --> 01:16:02.276]  Nationalism isn't perfect, but it's a lot better than globalism.
[01:16:02.276 --> 01:16:06.178]  Globalism isn't Star Trek, kumbaya, everybody loving each other.
[01:16:06.178 --> 01:16:11.941]  Globalism is global elites above the law, tax-exempt, with jumbo jets full of sex slaves.
[01:16:14.906 --> 01:16:16.147]  And I'm not going to be part of it.
[01:16:16.147 --> 01:16:19.549]  And I'm not going to sell out to it either.
[01:16:19.549 --> 01:16:23.211]  So the system needs to quit their overtures on a routine basis.
[01:16:23.211 --> 01:16:25.092]  Go talk to your psychologist and people.
[01:16:25.092 --> 01:16:26.573]  They've got, they've assessed me.
[01:16:26.573 --> 01:16:28.774]  They know I'm not selling out.
[01:16:28.774 --> 01:16:29.555]  Ever.
[01:16:29.555 --> 01:16:32.937]  So you can stop trying.
[01:16:32.937 --> 01:16:37.199]  Now, sell out to a bunch of child molesting trash?
[01:16:39.522 --> 01:16:43.184]  Just go ahead and just like Larry Nichols said yesterday, I'm tired of waiting.
[01:16:43.184 --> 01:16:46.266]  If that's your attitude, you think you're threatening me?
[01:16:46.266 --> 01:16:49.147]  Just get it going!
[01:16:49.147 --> 01:16:50.288]  That's not because I want to die.
[01:16:50.288 --> 01:16:50.828]  I want to live to be 150.
[01:16:50.828 --> 01:16:52.409]  I want to take care of my kids.
[01:16:52.409 --> 01:16:53.609]  I want to see my great grandkids.
[01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.050]  I want to have grandkids.
[01:16:55.050 --> 01:16:58.432]  But my grandkids won't exist if we don't beat this.
[01:16:58.432 --> 01:16:59.612]  Look at the headlines.
[01:16:59.612 --> 01:17:01.513]  Babies now to be made without men.
[01:17:01.513 --> 01:17:02.534]  Feminists, hail it!
[01:17:02.534 --> 01:17:06.316]  I've seen the lesbian groups going, we're going to have a baby without a man.
[01:17:08.353 --> 01:17:12.957]  You know how many disorders that kid's gonna have?
[01:17:12.957 --> 01:17:15.759]  Do you know how male genetics and female genetics merge?
[01:17:15.759 --> 01:17:19.463]  This is just craziness, folks.
[01:17:19.463 --> 01:17:21.044]  But here it is being hailed!
[01:17:21.044 --> 01:17:22.465]  Top Story, DrugsReport.com.
[01:17:22.465 --> 01:17:26.889]  It's also on Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com because it is an Infowars.com story.
[01:17:26.889 --> 01:17:31.493]  New York Times columnist jokes about assassination attempt ending Trump's campaign.
[01:17:31.493 --> 01:17:32.414]  Good news, guys!
[01:17:32.414 --> 01:17:34.916]  I figured out how the Trump campaign ends.
[01:17:38.052 --> 01:17:46.318]  New York Times columnist Ross Dovat caused outrage after he joked about how an assassination attempt could end Donald Trump's presidential campaign.
[01:17:46.318 --> 01:17:52.122]  Good news guys, I figured out how the Trump campaign ends, he said and tweeted last night.
[01:17:52.122 --> 01:18:03.169]  A video that I'm going to air in the next segment and then I'm going to air my Bohemian Grove Scalia piece in the segment after that with a roundtable discussion.
[01:18:03.169 --> 01:18:06.352]  The tweet links to a video clip from the 1983 movie The Dead Zone
[01:18:07.438 --> 01:18:10.494]  Which features a character played by Christopher Walken.
[01:18:11.644 --> 01:18:15.806]  Attempting to gun down a political figure played by Martin Sheen.
[01:18:15.806 --> 01:18:18.287]  In the plot, Walken's character tries to kill the U.S.
[01:18:18.287 --> 01:18:24.050]  senatorial candidate played by Sheen because he has visions of him becoming president in the future and starting a nuclear war.
[01:18:24.050 --> 01:18:29.773]  Sheen's character holds up his baby as a shield during the assassination attempt, destroying his credibility.
[01:18:29.773 --> 01:18:37.997]  While joking about an assassination attempt on any public figure is crass, it's particularly relevant that Trump has become and faces a very real threat of being targeted.
[01:18:40.603 --> 01:18:50.227]  As we previously highlighted, according to his former advisor, he's not his former advisor, he's a current advisor, he's formerly his campaign director.
[01:18:50.227 --> 01:18:51.607]  I'm going to change that.
[01:18:51.607 --> 01:18:54.729]  Not bitching, I just have to edit things on air.
[01:18:54.729 --> 01:19:04.813]  Trump now wears a bulletproof vest at all public appearances due to the sheer volume of death threats he receives on a regular basis.
[01:19:04.813 --> 01:19:07.394]  He's a confidant and friend.
[01:19:08.942 --> 01:19:19.569]  The Trump first began wearing the vest in October, but last year there were reports that he would most wanted drug lord, El Chapo, had put a $100 million bounty on his head.
[01:19:19.569 --> 01:19:22.571]  He also received Secret Service protection around that time.
[01:19:22.571 --> 01:19:29.956]  Following his controversial comments on Muslim integration back in December, Twitter exploded with death threats aimed at Trump, and then it goes on from there.
[01:19:29.956 --> 01:19:32.939]  Very important article, we need to get this out to everybody.
[01:19:32.939 --> 01:19:35.941]  I know Paul's working on a part two, but he's working on a piece
[01:19:36.861 --> 01:19:40.262]  On Scalia dead in the middle of an Illuminati compound.
[01:19:40.262 --> 01:19:43.223]  I mean, you know, the secret cult.
[01:19:43.223 --> 01:19:44.383]  What should the headline be?
[01:19:44.383 --> 01:19:47.644]  Scalia didn't die in a hunting secret society.
[01:19:47.644 --> 01:19:50.304]  He died in a Bavarian Illuminati.
[01:19:50.304 --> 01:19:52.985]  No, Scalia didn't die in a hunting secret society.
[01:19:52.985 --> 01:19:55.546]  He died in their Germanic death cult society.
[01:19:55.546 --> 01:19:56.726]  This is big!
[01:19:56.726 --> 01:19:57.246]  Stay with us.

[01:20:59.744 --> 01:21:03.027]  When it comes to seeing your favorite live event, being closer is better.
[01:21:03.027 --> 01:21:05.569]  Hi, I'm Adam Kanner, founder of ScoreBig.com.
[01:21:05.569 --> 01:21:11.874]  We set out to make going to live events better by creating a way for you to get closer to the action at a price you want to pay.
[01:21:11.874 --> 01:21:12.494]  How?
[01:21:12.494 --> 01:21:19.960]  At ScoreBig.com, we work directly with your favorite teams and performers to get their unsold seats at unpublished prices and pass the huge savings on to you.
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:21.922]  At ScoreBig.com, you can name a ticket price.
[01:21:22.022 --> 01:21:23.863]  Still haven't made it to an NBA or NHL game?
[01:21:23.863 --> 01:21:27.124]  The seasons are winding down, so don't miss your chance to save on tickets!
[01:21:49.033 --> 01:21:49.453]  I don't know.
[01:22:09.042 --> 01:22:17.472]  This enables your body to have virtually 100% utilization, whereas typical whey protein powders offer no more than 18% utilization of protein.
[01:22:17.472 --> 01:22:20.616]  One World Whey also delivers life-giving frequencies to your cells.
[01:22:20.616 --> 01:22:25.983]  The net result for so many people is improved energy, mood, and elimination of pain from inflammation.
[01:22:26.223 --> 01:22:30.665]  This technologically enhanced One World Way has been really amazing for me.
[01:22:30.665 --> 01:22:37.309]  I'm 36 years old, and for the past several years I've been struggling with lack of energy, drive, and stamina.
[01:22:37.309 --> 01:22:41.171]  And after just two weeks on this product, I'm feeling so much more energy.
[01:22:41.171 --> 01:22:47.454]  My yoga practice has deepened, and as a massage therapist, I'm able to see more clients than I've been able to in years.
[01:22:47.454 --> 01:22:50.375]  I've never felt results that quick with anything I've ever taken.
[01:22:51.696 --> 01:23:09.028]  I'm Nick Sobolewski, a SelectQuote agent with a true story of how SelectQuote goes to bat for you buying term life insurance.
[01:23:09.028 --> 01:23:12.631]  A while back, a man called me who had had prostate cancer.
[01:23:12.631 --> 01:23:16.314]  He asked if I could beat a very high quote another life insurance agent had given him.
[01:23:16.974 --> 01:23:18.795]  I said, let me see.
[01:23:18.795 --> 01:23:29.881]  Well, I took his pertinent information, then shopped the highly-rated, price-competitive companies we represent, and found one who pre-approved him for a premium way below what he had been quoted.
[01:23:29.881 --> 01:23:41.007]  When it comes to term life insurance, no other company touches select quotes, experience, and expertise in finding the right policy at the right price for almost anyone.
[01:23:41.946 --> 01:23:42.947]  How about you?
[01:23:42.947 --> 01:23:44.269]  For your free quote, call 1-800-654-1632.
[01:23:44.269 --> 01:23:44.589]  That's 1-800-654-1632.
[01:23:44.589 --> 01:23:44.709]  1-800-654-1632.
[01:23:44.709 --> 01:23:45.711]  Or go to selectquote.com.
[01:23:45.711 --> 01:23:46.091]  We shop.
[01:23:46.091 --> 01:23:46.351]  You save.
[01:24:13.672 --> 01:24:24.916]  A former prosecutor, and of course, TV host and radio host, Lionel, will be joining us for a couple of segments at the middle of the next hour, at the bottom of the hour.
[01:24:24.916 --> 01:24:33.219]  Because he has questions about Scalia's death as a former prosecutor and as a defense lawyer, and in other capacities, I guess in state and federal government.
[01:24:33.219 --> 01:24:38.841]  So he'll be joining us coming up to get into that.
[01:24:38.841 --> 01:24:39.942]  But it's a pretty big deal when
[01:24:42.150 --> 01:24:47.513]  You know that Bohemian Grove was founded by Skull and Bones, that was founded by the Illuminati, on record.
[01:24:47.513 --> 01:24:52.016]  I mean, that's mainline history books.
[01:24:52.016 --> 01:24:56.679]  There's Discovery Channel shows about it, that I am a guest on.
[01:24:56.679 --> 01:25:00.001]  And they went and did research and said, no, Mr. Jones is accurate.
[01:25:00.001 --> 01:25:05.744]  And really, nobody even put the stuff together, because it's in this history book, it's in that history book, but it all connects together.
[01:25:05.744 --> 01:25:06.465]  Very neatly.
[01:25:06.465 --> 01:25:08.106]  I mean, it's open and shut.
[01:25:09.059 --> 01:25:12.642]  And that this was a Bavarian Illuminati death cult meeting.
[01:25:12.642 --> 01:25:16.705]  And so they had to spin it that, oh, he died.
[01:25:19.727 --> 01:25:21.208]  Of natural causes.
[01:25:21.208 --> 01:25:22.869]  And we're not supposed to question anything.
[01:25:22.869 --> 01:25:25.251]  Could this get any weirder?
[01:25:25.251 --> 01:25:27.893]  We're going to have a roundtable discussion about that coming up.
[01:25:27.893 --> 01:25:33.317]  We'll open the phones up in the third hour on the death threat against Trump, all the other news.
[01:25:33.317 --> 01:25:35.839]  But David Knight ran in during the break and made a really great point.
[01:25:35.839 --> 01:25:38.300]  He brought me this article out of the Inquisitor.
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:42.864]  Hillary Clinton obituary hoax prompts Secret Service investigation.
[01:25:42.864 --> 01:25:44.185]  That was just five days ago.
[01:25:45.814 --> 01:25:51.457]  Bernie Sanders supporters submitted Hillary Clinton's obituary to the Las Vegas Review Journal on Friday.
[01:25:51.457 --> 01:25:56.641]  The campaign season has seen a number of political stunts, but this might be the first to get the Secret Service involved.
[01:25:56.641 --> 01:25:58.142]  They went and investigated.
[01:25:58.142 --> 01:26:12.130]  Will there be an investigation of a major New York Times writer saying the answer to Donald Trump is him dying, him being assassinated, and then tweeting a YouTube link to this film.
[01:26:12.130 --> 01:26:13.351]  It's an excellent film, by the way.
[01:26:14.363 --> 01:26:14.683]  We're good
[01:26:35.052 --> 01:26:37.753]  Millions the courage Trump has to do what he's doing.
[01:26:37.753 --> 01:26:43.836]  I love how cowards always say that those of us in the public eye that have controversial views and fight the elite that we're cowards.
[01:26:43.836 --> 01:26:50.039]  No, you are a punk coward that called for Trump to be killed.
[01:26:50.039 --> 01:26:51.900]  Now let's go ahead and go to this clip from the dead zone.
[01:26:51.900 --> 01:26:52.980]  It's 1983.
[01:27:15.151 --> 01:27:19.495]  You know, it's weird to know Martin Sheen so well.
[01:27:19.495 --> 01:27:23.739]  Martin Sheen, back when I used to bash Bush, was a huge fan.
[01:27:23.739 --> 01:27:25.921]  I'm not name-dropping, it's just weird.
[01:27:25.921 --> 01:27:32.547]  But after I went after Obama, I still had dinner with him a few times and everything, and he kind of halfway forgave me for not liking Obama and said, oh, I guess you're right later on.
[01:27:32.547 --> 01:27:34.548]  But he's a really good guy.
[01:27:34.548 --> 01:27:35.169]  He means well.
[01:27:35.169 --> 01:27:36.550]  People will attack him.
[01:27:36.550 --> 01:27:37.271]  But he's got a good heart.
[01:27:38.052 --> 01:27:41.235]  We've all had Christopher Walken on.
[01:27:41.235 --> 01:27:45.318]  He's a listener too, but won't talk politics.
[01:27:45.318 --> 01:27:46.780]  It's just weird.
[01:27:46.780 --> 01:27:48.942]  These are the people that are listeners.
[01:27:48.942 --> 01:27:51.244]  Christopher Walken, you name it.
[01:27:51.244 --> 01:27:53.546]  People didn't believe it until he showed up on the show once.
[01:27:53.546 --> 01:27:56.428]  Alright, Walken's about to try to shoot him.
[01:28:16.946 --> 01:28:28.431]  But he won't shoot because he's holding a baby in front of him.
[01:28:28.431 --> 01:28:37.155]  The Secret Service shoots him with a two-inch barrel gun in the hand and in the chest perfectly from 50 yards away.
[01:28:37.155 --> 01:28:37.956]  Pretty much impossible.
[01:28:38.971 --> 01:28:44.216]  But there you go, if you're a TV viewer, you just saw that Radio Lister's on there, edited it obviously.
[01:28:44.216 --> 01:28:48.320]  But that's the kind of crud being put out.
[01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:51.082]  And they are trying to encourage people to kill Trump.
[01:28:51.082 --> 01:28:52.464]  They celebrated when Scalia died.
[01:28:53.547 --> 01:28:58.412]  And I just hope that Trump doesn't fall down and have a magic heart attack or doesn't, you know, get found with a pillow over his face.
[01:28:58.412 --> 01:29:10.683]  And the media will be like, how dare Jones say there was no autopsy and a pillow over his face at a black op commander's house and they drove the body 300 plus miles secretly and they had two private jets there but didn't fly him out, but he flew in on it.
[01:29:10.683 --> 01:29:13.485]  Yeah, it was a secret society connected to the Illuminati, big deal.
[01:29:14.366 --> 01:29:22.881]  So he's at a secret compound with devil art and human sacrifice stuff everywhere, you know, with a known satanic organization, and he's dead, and a key Supreme Court person.
[01:29:22.881 --> 01:29:24.564]  I mean, whoa!
[01:29:24.564 --> 01:29:25.225]  Whoa!
[01:29:25.225 --> 01:29:27.049]  This crazy guy was asking questions.
[01:29:29.983 --> 01:29:31.565]  I mean, whoa, man.
[01:29:31.565 --> 01:29:37.010]  Meanwhile, the Chinese government says, do not elect Trump or we will do bad things to you.
[01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:38.331]  Go to hell, China!
[01:29:38.331 --> 01:29:48.060]  And I guess we've been maneuvered to the point where we are little minions of the communists murdering Qaikom pigs.
[01:29:48.060 --> 01:29:49.001]  We're on the march.
[01:29:49.001 --> 01:29:50.342]  We've got a special report coming up.
[01:29:50.342 --> 01:29:52.684]  A special report on the Illuminati.
[01:29:52.684 --> 01:29:54.466]  And then, roundtable discussion.
[01:29:54.466 --> 01:29:54.947]  Stay with us.
[01:30:00.819 --> 01:30:04.205]  Marco Rubio, Wall Street's boy toy.
[01:30:04.205 --> 01:30:09.774]  He's gotten more money from the elite donors in Wall Street than number two Jeb or even number three Hillary.
[01:30:09.774 --> 01:30:13.500]  After blowing 150 million dollars on Jeb, they still haven't learned anything.
[01:30:15.211 --> 01:30:17.614]  Jeb's dropping out didn't help Rubio in Nevada.
[01:30:17.614 --> 01:30:20.899]  Rubio is the establishment's 20% solution.
[01:30:20.899 --> 01:30:25.465]  Jeb had a sense of entitlement, kind of like the donor class and the party elite that support Rubio.
[01:30:25.465 --> 01:30:29.891]  They believe they can openly oppose the voters on their key issues and still win.
[01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:31.373]  But Rubio is a little smarter.
[01:30:31.773 --> 01:30:37.294]  He realizes that his support for illegal immigration with the Gang of Eight was a betrayal of the voters.
[01:30:37.294 --> 01:30:39.755]  But he still thinks they're too stupid to see through the lies.
[01:30:39.755 --> 01:30:47.857]  It's called Breitbart, a conspiracy website, and the president of the ICE union a liar when they exposed Rubio's betrayal with the Gang of Eight.
[01:30:47.857 --> 01:30:55.578]  But Rubio's campaign will provide a useful public service, identifying the GOP political class who will say anything to get elected.
[01:30:55.578 --> 01:30:57.379]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[01:30:58.719 --> 01:31:02.241]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[01:31:02.241 --> 01:31:10.486]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[01:31:10.486 --> 01:31:15.909]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[01:31:15.909 --> 01:31:18.430]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[01:31:59.787 --> 01:32:03.570]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[01:32:03.570 --> 01:32:11.295]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[01:32:11.295 --> 01:32:19.900]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[01:32:19.900 --> 01:32:24.343]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[01:32:24.343 --> 01:32:29.667]  Pathenogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[01:32:29.727 --> 01:32:30.748]  We're good to go.
[01:33:08.888 --> 01:33:14.564]  He aligns himself with the truth, and it's time for you to choose a side.
[01:33:14.564 --> 01:33:16.931]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[01:33:31.926 --> 01:33:36.227]  That's Shooter Jennings bringing us in with the Summer of Rage.
[01:33:36.227 --> 01:33:50.149]  All right, we're going to play a five-minute special report and some clips from Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and the Order of Death, the two films I've made on Bohemian Grove, the Illuminati satellite base from Bavaria, Germany, in their own annals.
[01:33:50.149 --> 01:33:52.650]  We infiltrated and got them, obviously.
[01:33:52.650 --> 01:34:00.651]  And now they admit in the Washington Post, Scalia died during a secret ritual meeting of a Bohemian Grove-founded spinoff that he's also a member of.
[01:34:01.678 --> 01:34:06.922]  So now this goes from being suspicious to absolutely there must be a criminal investigation.
[01:34:06.922 --> 01:34:08.663]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[01:34:08.663 --> 01:34:15.228]  It'd be like if you saw some crazy guy grab a kid out of a backyard and throw him in a van and they go, we're not going to investigate where the kid went.
[01:34:15.228 --> 01:34:18.550]  I mean, it's now reached that redonkulous level.
[01:34:18.550 --> 01:34:19.411]  We're going to play this report.
[01:34:20.196 --> 01:34:22.559]  We're going to go to David Knight who was down there with the team.
[01:34:22.559 --> 01:34:25.323]  The occultic photos, the videos we got.
[01:34:25.323 --> 01:34:29.108]  Dozens of devil masks, children being ripped apart.
[01:34:29.108 --> 01:34:31.010]  Just craziness.
[01:34:31.010 --> 01:34:32.892]  Inside the ranch where Scalia died.
[01:34:32.892 --> 01:34:33.113]  Then...
[01:34:34.431 --> 01:34:38.753]  We're going to talk to Kit Daniels, as well, and Joe Biggs.
[01:34:38.753 --> 01:34:42.114]  And I want to get Jakari involved, because I know he wasn't part of the team that went down there.
[01:34:42.114 --> 01:34:44.455]  He was working on a bunch of other stories.
[01:34:44.455 --> 01:34:45.936]  But I want to get his take on this.
[01:34:45.936 --> 01:34:46.716]  I know he's a Christian.
[01:34:46.716 --> 01:34:58.481]  I want to get his view on who would have thought that now it's, again, Bohemian Grove that I'm an expert on, that we're an expert on, and then now we're experts on Scalia's death, and then now it ties back into that.
[01:34:58.481 --> 01:35:00.322]  I mean, it's just all interconnected, folks.
[01:35:00.322 --> 01:35:03.323]  I didn't used to believe in all this stuff before I got involved on radio.
[01:35:03.643 --> 01:35:06.425]  I was a mainline Libertarian Ron Paul type guy.
[01:35:06.425 --> 01:35:12.329]  And then it just got weirder and weirder because I became somebody that sources came to.
[01:35:12.329 --> 01:35:16.352]  And it just, from there the rabbit hole opened up.
[01:35:16.352 --> 01:35:17.493]  So we're gonna get to that in a moment.
[01:35:17.493 --> 01:35:28.481]  Before I go any further though today, ladies and gentlemen, we have a massive, massive, massive, massive amount of amazing products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:35:28.481 --> 01:35:29.802]  Close to a thousand products now.
[01:35:31.363 --> 01:35:34.984]  Great ProGun, Molon Labe t-shirts, Hillary for Prison t-shirts, you name it.
[01:35:34.984 --> 01:35:40.146]  But at Infowarslife.com, a subsection, we have the very best nutraceuticals from the top.
[01:35:40.146 --> 01:35:41.267]  We use three big labs.
[01:35:41.267 --> 01:35:42.907]  Group has a great factory.
[01:35:42.907 --> 01:35:48.009]  And the two other big famous groups that produce stuff for Whole Foods, everybody.
[01:35:48.009 --> 01:35:52.871]  And we go to formulas even better and then cut out a bunch of the profit because I'm a free marketer.
[01:35:52.871 --> 01:35:57.133]  I want you to get the highest quality product that's affordable so that we dominate the market.
[01:35:57.133 --> 01:35:57.713]  And it's a win-win.
[01:35:58.513 --> 01:36:01.535]  We're able to fund the reporters, the operation, what we're doing.
[01:36:01.535 --> 01:36:02.975]  I want to be able to cover the RNC, the DNC.
[01:36:02.975 --> 01:36:04.596]  I want to be able to cover more.
[01:36:04.596 --> 01:36:08.018]  I want to hire a couple more reporters and writers and people, because we're stretched thin.
[01:36:08.018 --> 01:36:09.679]  We cover stuff late at night.
[01:36:09.679 --> 01:36:12.561]  Folks are doing 15-hour days here, okay?
[01:36:12.561 --> 01:36:15.122]  And all work and no play makes Alex Jones crazy.
[01:36:15.122 --> 01:36:16.423]  And the same thing with my crew.
[01:36:16.423 --> 01:36:19.084]  So we need to be able to beef up a little bit to really do our job.
[01:36:19.084 --> 01:36:20.265]  Thank you for your support.
[01:36:20.265 --> 01:36:22.266]  But get great products and fund the tip of the spear.
[01:36:22.266 --> 01:36:24.367]  This is a political and spiritual war.
[01:36:24.367 --> 01:36:25.068]  We need your prayers.
[01:36:25.948 --> 01:36:30.695]  Keep spreading the word about the broadcast, the free podcast, the stations you listen to us on.
[01:36:30.695 --> 01:36:38.187]  But go get Winter Sun Vitamin D3, at least for your children, because when you don't get sun for a month, you don't have Vitamin D3, and that's totally linked to why
[01:36:39.272 --> 01:36:42.133]  The winter and spring months and fall months are when people get so sick.
[01:36:42.133 --> 01:36:47.876]  Super high quality, liquid D3 under the tongue, 15% off, Winter Sun, Infowarslife.com.

[01:36:50.237 --> 01:36:51.517]  Great vitamin D product.
[01:36:51.517 --> 01:36:53.458]  I feel better when I take Winter Sun.
[01:36:53.458 --> 01:36:57.160]  This product will make you feel good while giving you the good kind of vitamin D3.
[01:36:58.260 --> 01:36:59.640]  Five-star review.

[01:37:40.660 --> 01:37:44.683]  And we also have Liver Shield out for two months now back in stock for the great liver cleanse.
[01:37:44.683 --> 01:37:49.726]  Go see the informational videos and more at InfoWarsLife.com or InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:37:51.658 --> 01:37:56.540]  Now, we're gonna go to break with this, not break, we're gonna go to this special report.
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:38:20.271]  That just gives you some of the history of the Bohemian Grove itself, that again is an admitted spinoff, in their own writings, of Skull and Bones, an admitted spinoff of the Bavarian Order of the Illuminati, that was the false revolution meant to destroy the Renaissance, led by Christians, led by good Masonic orders, and led by the Rosicrucians mainly, Sir Francis Bacon and others.
[01:38:20.271 --> 01:38:23.573]  And it was a Jesuit run, you could say it wasn't Catholic, but it was Jesuit,
[01:38:24.233 --> 01:38:28.697]  False revolution to smash the true Enlightenment.
[01:38:28.697 --> 01:38:32.940]  And it failed for a long time, but now it's getting full planetary control.
[01:38:32.940 --> 01:38:43.669]  The Pope has uncloaked himself as a pure agent of Lucifer, in my view, and is now attacking the family, life, borders, sovereignty, nationalism, manhood.
[01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:50.695]  The Communist Chinese, who we know are pure agents of the devil, are attacking Trump, and yours truly, and Michael Savage, and everybody else.
[01:38:51.495 --> 01:38:53.537]  This is the full attempt to bring down America.
[01:38:53.537 --> 01:38:58.602]  You're witnessing right now the enemy's full force combining now to shatter the Republic.
[01:38:58.602 --> 01:39:02.645]  And who would have ever thought Donald Trump would rise up as the populace to resist it?
[01:39:02.645 --> 01:39:06.088]  Now, if he isn't that man that's really trying to resist it, he'll be anathema.
[01:39:06.088 --> 01:39:08.771]  Well, let's go to this report and come back and shift gears.
[01:39:08.771 --> 01:39:14.336]  In Tuscalia, found dead at a satellite base of the Bohemian Grove Brevarian Illuminati.
[01:39:15.615 --> 01:39:29.607]  Our story begins in Northern California over a hundred years ago, when locals began to spread rumors of bizarre occult rituals being conducted in the ancient redwood groves of Sonoma County.
[01:39:29.607 --> 01:39:35.572]  As the decades passed, it became clear these incredible stories had a basis in truth.
[01:39:36.132 --> 01:39:42.221]  And their source was a 2,700 acre private club known as the Bohemian Grove.
[01:39:42.221 --> 01:39:50.674]  Then in a time period between the mid-1970s and the early 1990s, scores of reporters attempted to infiltrate the Grove.
[01:39:51.497 --> 01:39:53.998]  All attempts were unsuccessful.
[01:39:53.998 --> 01:40:01.161]  Grove security identified them, threw them out for trespassing, or in some cases, had the local police arrest them.
[01:40:01.161 --> 01:40:04.923]  To many, it seemed, the Grove's secrets would never become public.
[01:40:04.923 --> 01:40:19.649]  All of that changed on July 15, 2000, when we ripped aside the veil of secrecy and were successfully able to penetrate the Bohemian Grove on their High Holy Day and videotape the cremation of care ritual.
[01:40:24.394 --> 01:40:24.934]  We're good to go.
[01:41:05.723 --> 01:41:17.191]  Now again, this is all done with pageantry, but religion was always set up as pageantry.
[01:41:17.191 --> 01:41:19.112]  That was the first theater.
[01:41:19.112 --> 01:41:22.054]  Now they're about to do the mock human sacrifice.
[01:41:22.054 --> 01:41:26.737]  And this is only a small part of the hour-long ritual that's in Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove.
[01:41:26.737 --> 01:41:30.439]  And again, it was shot on a primitive digital camera in a bag.
[01:41:30.439 --> 01:41:30.880]  And then it's...
[01:41:32.557 --> 01:41:38.819]  Secret Service watching me, so it's not that good.
[01:41:38.819 --> 01:41:41.620]  Be gone, don't care.
[01:41:41.620 --> 01:41:44.101]  Fire shall have its will of thee.
[01:41:44.101 --> 01:41:46.262]  Be gone, don't care.
[01:41:46.262 --> 01:41:50.143]  And all the wind, make merry with thy nuts.
[01:41:50.143 --> 01:41:53.585]  Hail fellowship's eternal flame.
[01:41:53.585 --> 01:41:57.626]  Once again, Midsummer sets us free.
[01:42:02.185 --> 01:42:11.728]  Now again, that's a Faustian deal of getting rid of their conscience and putting it all on the effigy of a child they're burning, who they bring in on a hearse.
[01:42:11.728 --> 01:42:17.451]  Drawn by... Now there you see the funeral pyre burning with the effigy of a human.
[01:42:17.451 --> 01:42:20.131]  Or it could be real, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:42:20.131 --> 01:42:24.813]  There's been a lot of strange going-ons in that area of Northern California.
[01:42:24.813 --> 01:42:29.415]  But this is what the establishment is into right here in America.
[01:42:29.935 --> 01:42:32.656]  Where did this dark thinking start?
[01:42:32.656 --> 01:42:35.177]  This black spirituality?
[01:42:35.177 --> 01:42:40.859]  The central thread goes back to ancient Egypt and Babylon with the mystery schools.
[01:42:40.859 --> 01:42:52.264]  They knew that knowledge is power and so secret societies were formed to guard the secrets of medicine, architecture, government, agriculture,
[01:42:53.184 --> 01:42:59.406]  Secret societies are nothing more than the first intelligence agencies.
[01:42:59.406 --> 01:43:01.686]  Knowledge had to be guarded.
[01:43:01.686 --> 01:43:10.969]  But over time, elites abused their control of the knowledge and used it to dominate their populations.
[01:43:10.969 --> 01:43:15.910]  And the same sciences of control are being used today.
[01:43:16.650 --> 01:43:19.874]  That's why the elite today relishes secrecy.
[01:43:19.874 --> 01:43:22.918]  They know that it is the fount of their power.
[01:43:22.918 --> 01:43:34.533]  They seek to dumb down the population, not just to hoard their secret knowledge to make us even more mindless, more domesticated, like braying sheep to the slaughter.
[01:43:35.214 --> 01:43:47.960]  Their religion is the science of sophistry, the science of the con artist, the science of the despot, the dictator, the tyrant, the controller, the charlatan, the liar.
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:50.661]  They come to kill, steal, and destroy.
[01:43:51.081 --> 01:43:52.663]  They are parasites.
[01:43:52.663 --> 01:43:57.308]  They are anathema to free, dynamic human societies.
[01:43:57.308 --> 01:43:59.070]  Know your enemy.
[01:43:59.070 --> 01:44:10.402]  Stand up for love and life and family and resist the New World Order and the Babylonian slave state our enemies are attempting to construct.
[01:44:13.806 --> 01:44:26.472]  And the last time I was there, three years ago, four years ago, with History Channel, they were shooting it in this local theater that had all this bizarre satanic stuff all over the walls, you name it, that a guy, the main director was wearing a hat that said CIA on it.
[01:44:28.488 --> 01:44:33.990]  And the bartender behind the bar, because they had catering and food for the crew, was a Brad Metzler show.
[01:44:33.990 --> 01:44:35.611]  Big budget.
[01:44:35.611 --> 01:44:37.372]  The guy behind the counter goes, I'm friends with the Bushes.
[01:44:37.372 --> 01:44:40.973]  And he goes, I think you're the government coming here and saying we're doing rituals there.
[01:44:40.973 --> 01:44:42.394]  And I said, I know most of you aren't doing bad.
[01:44:42.394 --> 01:44:45.055]  I know it's just a big party doing duck people into deeper groups.
[01:44:46.960 --> 01:44:49.224]  And he said, uh-huh, so you guys are going to sneak in there today.
[01:44:49.224 --> 01:44:50.065]  And I went, whoa.
[01:44:50.065 --> 01:44:52.569]  And I went and told him, I said, that guy's calling to tell him we're going to be there.
[01:44:52.569 --> 01:44:54.051]  And they're, oh, that's ridiculous.
[01:44:54.051 --> 01:44:56.294]  And we get there, and they get arrested, and I get away.
[01:44:56.294 --> 01:44:58.498]  Had to jump in the river and literally swim away.
[01:44:58.498 --> 01:45:01.021]  They like fools ran back to the police.
[01:45:02.421 --> 01:45:02.882]  I don't think so.
[01:45:25.762 --> 01:45:25.882]  Yeah.
[01:45:46.687 --> 01:46:04.180]  Justice Scalia spent his last hours with members of the Secretive Society of Elite Hunters, but that was, quote, founded as an outreach by Bohemian Grove in 1960, they say in the article, because Hitler had exterminated the group because they wouldn't join him.
[01:46:04.180 --> 01:46:05.741]  And that's actually true.
[01:46:05.741 --> 01:46:07.102]  Herman Goering was going to be the head of it.
[01:46:07.102 --> 01:46:08.563]  They said no, so they killed him.
[01:46:10.913 --> 01:46:12.754]  And that just shows the power of secret societies.
[01:46:12.754 --> 01:46:18.397]  And I remember reading books about the Nazis taking down all the secret societies because they wouldn't join them.
[01:46:18.397 --> 01:46:20.339]  So, again, we're not saying they're Nazis either.
[01:46:20.339 --> 01:46:23.000]  We're not saying Scalia was involved in Satanism.
[01:46:23.000 --> 01:46:29.024]  This is how they get people to join, either for sex, or either for, quote, hidden knowledge, or for to be in a hunting club.
[01:46:29.966 --> 01:46:37.698]  That's and then the Illuminati papers written by Weishaupt that are public that are admitted to be his, they talk about how they get the best men to join them.
[01:46:37.698 --> 01:46:44.308]  We're going to go to the next hour with everybody to have plenty of time on this because we'll also cover Trump and the death threats from the New York Times.
[01:46:44.308 --> 01:46:45.469]  But who wants to go first here?
[01:46:46.055 --> 01:46:50.580]  Well Alex, you know, when we were there we were talking about the issue as why are they meeting in secret?
[01:46:50.580 --> 01:46:53.703]  Why do we not know any of the 36 people that were there?
[01:46:53.703 --> 01:46:54.083]  Right.
[01:46:54.083 --> 01:46:56.726]  Except for Scalia and Poindexter at the time.
[01:46:56.726 --> 01:46:58.528]  When the sheriff... Total red flag from the beginning!
[01:46:58.528 --> 01:46:58.908]  Exactly.
[01:46:58.908 --> 01:47:02.732]  When the sheriff's report came out, we got another person's name.
[01:47:02.732 --> 01:47:04.954]  And so, Alan Foster.
[01:47:05.755 --> 01:47:16.624]  As the Washington Post did this report, and they talked to Poindexter, he says, there's nothing I can add to your observation that among my many guests at Cibola Creek Ranch over the years, some members of the International Order of St.
[01:47:16.624 --> 01:47:18.446]  Hubertus have been numbered.
[01:47:18.446 --> 01:47:19.727]  That's a weird way to talk.
[01:47:19.727 --> 01:47:22.169]  You know, he all talked cryptic, because this guy's a total total...
[01:47:22.569 --> 01:47:29.174]  And then he says, I'm aware of no connection between that organization and Justice Scalia, as if he doesn't belong to the organization.
[01:47:29.174 --> 01:47:35.920]  He's one of the leaders of the organization, as is the friend of Scalia who traveled there, Alan Foster.
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:40.563]  And then as you go through and look at the people... In a room surrounded by devil masks and children being ripped limb from limb.
[01:47:40.563 --> 01:47:42.805]  We're going to roll the video over to this right now.
[01:47:42.805 --> 01:47:43.946]  He dies mysteriously.
[01:47:43.946 --> 01:47:44.887]  There's no autopsy.
[01:47:44.887 --> 01:47:45.947]  Pillow over the head.
[01:47:45.947 --> 01:47:47.268]  Story changes over and over again.
[01:47:47.268 --> 01:47:48.269]  Key justice.
[01:47:48.269 --> 01:47:49.430]  And we're not supposed to ask questions.
[01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:50.211]  Keep going.
[01:47:50.211 --> 01:47:51.552]  Could this be more sensational?
[01:47:51.812 --> 01:47:52.333]  Right, right.
[01:47:52.333 --> 01:47:56.637]  Poindexter says, uh, I'm not aware that there's any connection between Scalia and that group.
[01:47:56.637 --> 01:48:03.304]  And yet, Poindexter, Scalia's friend, the two guys who had planes that flew in there on the 12th, flew out on the 14th.
[01:48:03.304 --> 01:48:07.429]  Poindexter, earlier in statements, remember, we've got him, said, I never knew him before.
[01:48:07.429 --> 01:48:08.290]  I didn't know him.
[01:48:08.290 --> 01:48:08.610]  Yeah.
[01:48:08.610 --> 01:48:10.452]  Now he's in a super secret group with him.
[01:48:10.452 --> 01:48:11.052]  Right, right.
[01:48:11.052 --> 01:48:12.294]  They're both officers in it.
[01:48:12.614 --> 01:48:16.195]  We know four people's names who were there besides Scalia.
[01:48:16.195 --> 01:48:20.776]  All four of them are, or were, former leaders of the organization.
[01:48:20.776 --> 01:48:23.397]  So, you know, and we don't know the rest of the people who were there.
[01:48:23.397 --> 01:48:24.037]  But that's amazing.
[01:48:24.037 --> 01:48:34.619]  We look at that footage of that artwork that we were talking the other day, and we talked about how, as we would eat, there were all these masks, double masks, looking down at us as we were eating.
[01:48:34.619 --> 01:48:36.980]  We were all remarking about how creepy that was.
[01:48:36.980 --> 01:48:39.701]  Joe took a selfie of the masks up behind him.
[01:48:39.701 --> 01:48:41.561]  And then... And he said it looks like
[01:48:41.601 --> 01:48:42.762]  Bohemian Grove 2.0.
[01:48:42.762 --> 01:48:43.322]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:48:43.322 --> 01:48:43.923]  He called it.
[01:48:43.923 --> 01:48:45.384]  Joe Bid called it.
[01:48:45.384 --> 01:48:48.026]  And we said it's really kind of Bohemian sagebrush.
[01:48:48.026 --> 01:48:53.851]  It was kind of our joke about it, you know, kind of a cross between Bohemian Grove and The Shining is the way the place felt.
[01:48:53.851 --> 01:49:08.502]  But as we were, as I was sitting there texting my wife while the other guys were basically on air, I look over my shoulder and I see this amazing sculpture that has got devils and ripping people apart with sacrifice.
[01:49:08.502 --> 01:49:09.303]  Ripping children apart.
[01:49:10.183 --> 01:49:14.326]  And this is not the kind of Day of the Dead artwork that you see from Mexico.
[01:49:14.326 --> 01:49:15.447]  I see that all the time.
[01:49:15.447 --> 01:49:17.189]  That's where everybody's dressed up, they got skeletons.
[01:49:17.189 --> 01:49:19.250]  No, this was Santeria voodoo heaven.
[01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:25.054]  Yeah, they have the Day of the Dead, they have the stylized... This wasn't light Santeria, by the way.
[01:49:25.054 --> 01:49:26.335]  This was black magic stuff.
[01:49:26.335 --> 01:49:26.896]  I mean, I know it.
[01:49:27.116 --> 01:49:28.076]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:28.076 --> 01:49:30.598]  So, yeah, it's coming up in that clip there that we've got rolling.
[01:49:30.598 --> 01:49:32.438]  I started making a study of the occult, like I said.
[01:49:32.438 --> 01:49:37.561]  I mean, it's bizarre, because I lived in the richest county in Texas, and there were all these rich people.
[01:49:37.561 --> 01:49:38.381]  My dad was just a dentist.
[01:49:38.381 --> 01:49:39.842]  I was middle class.
[01:49:39.842 --> 01:49:46.405]  And, you know, I was a good-looking guy, and all the rest of it, and aggressive, and wore heavy metal shirts, and got in fights, and I guess they thought I was one of their fellow travelers.
[01:49:46.405 --> 01:49:50.426]  And they just three times tried to recruit me into, I mean, high-level satanic stuff.
[01:49:50.426 --> 01:49:52.427]  And, of course, I never would be part of it.
[01:49:52.427 --> 01:49:53.628]  And then they really got upset with me.
[01:49:53.628 --> 01:49:55.709]  But folks need to know, this is going on like a movie.
[01:49:56.389 --> 01:49:58.812]  And we're showing it on screen right now for TV viewers.
[01:49:58.812 --> 01:50:04.637]  Yeah, it's pretty amazing, and like I said, that is not anything at all like the Day of the Dead artwork.
[01:50:04.637 --> 01:50:15.248]  Furthermore, the Washington Post went back ten years to an article that they had about this one individual, Alan Foster, who was a close friend of Scalia, who traveled with him, they say.
[01:50:15.908 --> 01:50:20.391]  And he took 40 of his friends to Czech Republic.
[01:50:20.391 --> 01:50:23.753]  They had things like a masked costume ball.
[01:50:23.753 --> 01:50:25.534]  That's Bohemia.
[01:50:25.534 --> 01:50:28.396]  The Czech Republic was at the old heart of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
[01:50:28.396 --> 01:50:30.937]  That's why they call it Owl of Bohemia.
[01:50:30.937 --> 01:50:31.978]  It's not really an owl.
[01:50:32.298 --> 01:50:34.279]  And then you, everything's always hidden for initiates.
[01:50:34.279 --> 01:50:37.220]  You don't learn what it is until you get deeper into it.
[01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:41.582]  These are just basically outer pools where they vet you into the deeper areas.
[01:50:41.582 --> 01:50:49.885]  So when we come back, Leanne, I want to get your take on this, and then Joe Biggs, and also Kit are in the other war room, and the situation room.
[01:50:49.885 --> 01:50:51.705]  Then we're also going to get Jakari if he can pop in.

[01:54:01.695 --> 01:54:02.876]  I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[01:54:02.876 --> 01:54:05.398]  We have the full crew in here of reporters.
[01:54:05.398 --> 01:54:16.146]  Many of them went down to this bizarro 30,000 acre ranch with occultism, children being torn limb from limb by demons, just devil mask everywhere, just over the top stuff.
[01:54:16.146 --> 01:54:17.728]  And some of those aren't aren't tanneria.
[01:54:17.728 --> 01:54:19.909]  Those are voodoo masks, by the way.
[01:54:19.909 --> 01:54:23.993]  So this is that's why Nico has family down there and said three weeks ago, I don't like going down there.
[01:54:23.993 --> 01:54:27.856]  You know, all the voodoo and all the dead bodies that have been found right over the border of that ranch.
[01:54:28.436 --> 01:54:31.037]  And they do autopsies on them too.
[01:54:31.037 --> 01:54:32.298]  They sacrifice many of them.
[01:54:32.298 --> 01:54:35.219]  He has a hearse company, right?
[01:54:35.219 --> 01:54:37.240]  So you can't make this up.
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:40.782]  We're going to be going to Joe Biggs and Kit and Jakar right into the next hour.
[01:54:41.980 --> 01:54:46.561]  Talking about all this, but I remember Joe Big saying, it's like The Shining, this place is creepy.
[01:54:46.561 --> 01:54:47.241]  You said that.
[01:54:47.241 --> 01:54:49.442]  Everybody was freaked out, wanted to get out of there.
[01:54:49.442 --> 01:54:50.922]  Who knows what's going on in there?
[01:54:50.922 --> 01:54:55.483]  Because you pick up on those vibes, like at Auschwitz or wherever, or in the Roman Coliseum.
[01:54:55.483 --> 01:54:56.804]  Leanne, what do you think about this?
[01:54:56.804 --> 01:54:59.364]  I mean, you are excited about this like I am.
[01:54:59.364 --> 01:55:05.326]  I got so freaked out when I read your tweet to me, or your text message from late last night and Joe's.
[01:55:05.326 --> 01:55:06.026]  I was like, what?
[01:55:06.026 --> 01:55:07.166]  It was Bohemian Grove?
[01:55:07.166 --> 01:55:07.386]  What?
[01:55:07.386 --> 01:55:09.807]  Because it just all, I was like, again?
[01:55:09.807 --> 01:55:10.907]  The devil worshippers?
[01:55:11.667 --> 01:55:13.548]  I mean, it's just so real.
[01:55:13.548 --> 01:55:17.970]  Well, I mean, for me it was just kind of confirmation because this is, I had already been feeling this way.
[01:55:17.970 --> 01:55:20.711]  I know Wayne Madsen and I. You were saying how bad it's a bohemian growth.
[01:55:20.711 --> 01:55:31.836]  Yeah, well it just, you get that sense and the fact that it was covered up so quickly and the guy poindexter comes out right away and says, you know, it was a tragic, it was a great loss.
[01:55:31.836 --> 01:55:39.080]  Having made that statement, if it was his time to go, he was surrounded by friends, in fairly nice setting, with a full tummy too.
[01:55:40.385 --> 01:55:41.726]  It's all written like a book.
[01:55:41.726 --> 01:55:43.026]  It's all been scripted.
[01:55:43.026 --> 01:55:44.187]  The whole thing was scripted.
[01:55:44.187 --> 01:55:50.269]  It was good to have them numbered among us.
[01:55:50.269 --> 01:55:55.071]  What grown man talks about another grown man's tummy?
[01:55:55.071 --> 01:55:56.311]  It was creepy to me.
[01:55:56.311 --> 01:55:57.172]  Immediately creepy.
[01:55:57.172 --> 01:56:00.173]  And then how he talked about the bedclothes were unwrinkled.
[01:56:00.993 --> 01:56:03.615]  You know, it just... He was very comfortable with a pillow over his head.
[01:56:03.615 --> 01:56:05.676]  It was just... And Luke O'Broxie sleeps with the fishies.
[01:56:05.676 --> 01:56:11.381]  You could tell that his close friends that he was with were wanting to really conceal everything that happened.
[01:56:11.381 --> 01:56:18.606]  They didn't talk about the two jets waiting that could have flown him, you know, in 30 minutes to Dallas, 30 minutes to San Antonio.
[01:56:18.606 --> 01:56:25.711]  He just so happens to have a friend in El Paso that runs a more... It was all so perfectly prepared!
[01:56:25.711 --> 01:56:26.692]  Yes.
[01:56:26.692 --> 01:56:28.974]  And here's Scalia, a big hunter, gets into this group
[01:56:29.864 --> 01:56:30.865]  You're going to have spinoffs.
[01:56:30.865 --> 01:56:33.287]  That's what the Illuminati talks about in the Vysot papers.
[01:56:33.287 --> 01:56:36.649]  Spinoffs to get the best men to be in your order, but they don't know.
[01:56:36.649 --> 01:56:36.889]  Right.
[01:56:36.889 --> 01:56:38.610]  Well, and I actually used to date a guy.
[01:56:38.610 --> 01:56:42.954]  He was in the Air Force, and he joined the Masons, and that's what he was talking about.
[01:56:42.954 --> 01:56:46.316]  I was like, no, they're great, wonderful people, and Christian, and we do all these things.
[01:56:46.316 --> 01:56:48.718]  And I was like, yeah, but what degree are you?
[01:56:48.718 --> 01:56:49.719]  And just keep watching.
[01:56:50.359 --> 01:56:53.862]  I'm not defending the Masons, but I've done deep research and I've looked at it.
[01:56:53.862 --> 01:56:56.945]  A lot of my ancestors were very high level Masons founded in Texas.
[01:56:56.945 --> 01:57:01.689]  These were incredibly godly men, totally ready to sacrifice their lives for God.
[01:57:01.689 --> 01:57:09.415]  They used the whole ancient Masonic order as a vehicle for their organization, but it has been taken over by black magic practitioners to a great extent.
[01:57:09.415 --> 01:57:13.459]  So it's true that a lot of the Masonic halls are actually Satanist halls now, but that's
[01:57:13.979 --> 01:57:17.961]  That's like a fiddler crab will move into somebody else's shell.
[01:57:17.961 --> 01:57:23.544]  The original Masons, under the Christian orders, were pretty much really good people.
[01:57:23.544 --> 01:57:26.766]  But before that, it was black and white magic from Egypt.
[01:57:26.766 --> 01:57:27.086]  Right.
[01:57:27.086 --> 01:57:29.827]  Well, it's definitely as the higher up you go, there is power there.
[01:57:29.827 --> 01:57:33.569]  So, I mean, you could use it either way, which is, you know, kind of scary.
[01:57:33.569 --> 01:57:40.272]  This whole scenario reminds me of the Da Vinci Code and just how there's like these secret societies and they're trying to hold these secrets.
[01:57:40.272 --> 01:57:41.033]  But, you know, we're just
[01:57:41.873 --> 01:57:43.756]  Yeah, what is the headline for Watson?
[01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:48.321]  Scalia died in real life Da Vinci Code Satanic Temple?
[01:57:48.321 --> 01:57:50.003]  Because that's what that place is.
[01:57:50.003 --> 01:57:51.144]  I mean, I looked at it.
[01:57:51.144 --> 01:57:52.646]  Yeah, he had no connection to anybody, though.
[01:57:52.646 --> 01:57:57.351]  It just so happens that the only four other people whose names we know were leaders of the organization.
[01:57:57.351 --> 01:58:00.074]  Yeah, and this is from the Houston Chronicle.
[01:58:00.074 --> 01:58:02.577]  I mean, he went to a secret society event.
[01:58:02.717 --> 01:58:06.460]  In 2011, where they're talking about Houstonians joined the Order of St.
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:16.546]  Hubertus, and then it talks about how the Southwest Priory, which is Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas, New Mexico, is the largest member chapter, according to its leader, Don Poindexter.
[01:58:33.038 --> 01:58:34.139]  People say I'm part of these groups?
[01:58:34.139 --> 01:58:34.860]  No, no, no.
[01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:38.626]  They've tried to recruit me to these groups because I'm genetically part of them.
[01:58:38.626 --> 01:58:39.147]  We'll be back.
[01:58:39.147 --> 01:58:40.449]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:58:40.449 --> 01:58:42.873]  And we're here to break this system wide open.

[01:58:48.663 --> 01:58:53.305]  Tell folks how you got introduced to Super Male, and then when Super Female came out, tell us what happened.
[01:58:53.305 --> 01:58:58.087]  After I saw such a huge positive change in my husband, I had to try it for myself.
[01:58:58.087 --> 01:58:59.408]  Talk about the effects.
[01:58:59.408 --> 01:59:00.909]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning.
[01:59:00.909 --> 01:59:02.850]  I have drive to go to the gym.
[01:59:02.850 --> 01:59:03.970]  I feel like I look better.
[01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:04.670]  I feel better.
[01:59:04.670 --> 01:59:06.071]  I feel sexier.
[01:59:06.071 --> 01:59:06.711]  I love it.
[01:59:06.711 --> 01:59:09.673]  Even if you don't believe in supplements, take the challenge.
[01:59:09.673 --> 01:59:12.374]  Get a bottle of Super Male, a bottle of Super Female.
[01:59:12.614 --> 01:59:13.674]  Check it out for yourself.
[01:59:13.674 --> 01:59:14.875]  Consult your physician.

[01:59:40.185 --> 01:59:41.286]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:59:41.286 --> 01:59:42.727]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:59:42.727 --> 01:59:44.228]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:22.156 --> 02:00:27.980]  Coming up tonight at InfoWars.com, we're going to have free feeds of our extended nightly news coverage.
[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:31.763]  Normally it's Subscriber, PrisonPlanet.tv, $5.95 a month.
[02:00:31.763 --> 02:00:32.804]  20 people can use each membership.
[02:00:32.804 --> 02:00:35.546]  That just pays for some of the equipment and the bandwidth.
[02:00:35.546 --> 02:00:41.090]  But on special events like debates, the caucuses, the RNC, the DNC, we have analysis of the debate itself.
[02:00:41.690 --> 02:00:42.891]  I mean, you were the first to say Bohemian Grove.
[02:00:42.891 --> 02:00:44.412]  Leanne said, this is like a Bohemian Grove.
[02:00:44.412 --> 02:00:45.592]  And I said, let's see first.
[02:01:07.566 --> 02:01:09.608]  Try to see, you know, what's in the bookshelves down there.
[02:01:09.608 --> 02:01:10.369]  Try to ask questions.
[02:01:10.369 --> 02:01:11.530]  They wouldn't talk to you.
[02:01:11.530 --> 02:01:13.893]  And now they admit Bohemian Grove founded this.
[02:01:13.893 --> 02:01:18.498]  Well, Bohemian Grove was given birth to by Skull and Bones, whose daddy was the Illuminati on record.
[02:01:18.498 --> 02:01:19.599]  This is a big deal, Joe Biggs.
[02:01:19.599 --> 02:01:20.300]  What's your take on it?
[02:01:20.697 --> 02:01:24.201]  I mean, naturally, you can sense evil when you come into a place like that.
[02:01:24.201 --> 02:01:29.988]  I mean, from the get-go, walking into the gate, we go to the front area, the front entrance area.
[02:01:29.988 --> 02:01:32.311]  The lady comes out and goes, yeah, you don't get any keys.
[02:01:32.311 --> 02:01:35.215]  And I'm sitting there thinking, I don't get keys for my room?
[02:01:35.215 --> 02:01:37.417]  She goes, no, no, no, we are the only ones that have keys for that.
[02:01:38.098 --> 02:01:41.741]  So, then she takes us on a tour and tells us... That sounds like you're at Count Dracula's castle.
[02:01:41.741 --> 02:01:44.483]  You know, it's raining, you're on horses, you're out, please come in.
[02:01:44.483 --> 02:01:45.323]  Yes, come in.
[02:01:45.323 --> 02:01:45.944]  Is this my room?
[02:01:45.944 --> 02:01:48.646]  There's no, there's no, you know, the locks on the outside?
[02:01:48.646 --> 02:01:51.108]  Don't worry, it's not a jail cell.
[02:01:51.108 --> 02:01:52.309]  You know, sorry, go ahead.
[02:01:52.309 --> 02:02:04.358]  So then, then she goes on to tell us a little history about the building that when the property was bought, they dug up a whole bunch of human skeletons and behind where Scalia's room was, there's actually a big cemetery with stacked rocks.
[02:02:04.818 --> 02:02:07.989]  And you see it's like almost an above ground type of...
[02:02:09.517 --> 02:02:11.258]  Burial type, how the rocks are stacked over.
[02:02:11.258 --> 02:02:12.038]  That's old-fashioned.
[02:02:12.038 --> 02:02:13.039]  Yeah, old-fashioned like that.
[02:02:13.039 --> 02:02:15.240]  And they should have some B-roll of that, too, as well.
[02:02:15.240 --> 02:02:16.520]  Drone footage and all of that.
[02:02:16.520 --> 02:02:17.661]  Shallow graves.
[02:02:17.661 --> 02:02:19.562]  Yeah, it's really interesting.
[02:02:19.562 --> 02:02:29.626]  And then you get out there, and you start walking through the hallways, and you're, you know, you see these beds on the outside in the open with glass, you know, the glass you can see through out into the pool.
[02:02:29.626 --> 02:02:37.450]  Like, they have this stuff set up so you can be out there, you can be seen, it's exciting, whatever's going on, and you have this really weird feeling.
[02:02:37.890 --> 02:02:40.992]  You know, and that's when I started going, oh my God, I mean, I don't want to be here.
[02:02:40.992 --> 02:02:42.433]  This feels like The Shining.
[02:02:42.433 --> 02:02:45.574]  This has this both creamy and grove feel to it.
[02:02:45.574 --> 02:02:47.055]  You know, they call us in for dinner.
[02:02:47.055 --> 02:02:48.216]  You have dinner at the same time.
[02:02:48.216 --> 02:02:51.197]  It's a family style gathering for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[02:02:51.197 --> 02:02:53.078]  And we got there for the dinner.
[02:02:53.078 --> 02:03:01.443]  And I'm sitting down and I'm getting ready to take a picture saying, you know, this is the last spot where Scalia, you know, sat before, you know, his untimely death.
[02:03:01.443 --> 02:03:03.524]  Surrounded by devil masks.
[02:03:03.604 --> 02:03:18.113]  Exactly, so I'm sitting here looking at my camera and I notice the mask behind me I didn't notice before and I turn around and I see these devil horns and these masks everywhere and I'm like, oh my god, this is the kind of stuff that he was seeing right before, you know, the last things he saw before he went to bed and never woke up again.
[02:03:18.113 --> 02:03:19.614]  You know, now we find out.
[02:03:19.614 --> 02:03:24.017]  Let's roll some of those devil skulls if we can, because that's important.
[02:03:24.017 --> 02:03:28.460]  Oh, and here we have the children and the mommy being torn apart by demons.
[02:03:28.840 --> 02:03:31.221]  Well, yeah, we saw this late at night, actually, I believe.
[02:03:31.221 --> 02:03:32.782]  That's when David showed me.
[02:03:32.782 --> 02:03:34.483]  He goes, hey man, you gotta come over and check this out.
[02:03:34.483 --> 02:03:36.184]  This is, like, really interesting.
[02:03:36.184 --> 02:03:38.385]  He's got a flashlight or whatever and shines it on there.
[02:03:38.385 --> 02:03:40.006]  And I went, oh my God!
[02:03:40.006 --> 02:03:45.769]  You know, there's this, like, devil figure with a woman with a missing eye and, like, children being torn apart.
[02:03:45.769 --> 02:03:48.150]  And I'm like, this is creeping me out.
[02:03:48.150 --> 02:03:51.812]  By the way, they keep having Skull and Bones meetings and others.
[02:03:52.870 --> 02:04:02.277]  Like Bilderberg and this particular Marriott in Chantilly, Virginia, that also has like diseased, dying children in portraits on the walls.
[02:04:02.277 --> 02:04:04.558]  I mean, who are these people?
[02:04:04.558 --> 02:04:06.199]  I don't know, but there's definitely something going on.
[02:04:06.199 --> 02:04:13.685]  I mean, the fact that this was created during Bohemian Grove back there in California, and this is virtually a spinoff of that.
[02:04:13.685 --> 02:04:19.048]  You know, back in 2010, they had, what was it, 53 guests that were part of this secretive society at
[02:04:20.089 --> 02:04:20.749]  No, no, no.
[02:04:20.749 --> 02:04:23.611]  There's just hundreds of devil-masking babies being torn apart.
[02:04:23.611 --> 02:04:24.071]  Come on, pigs.
[02:04:24.071 --> 02:04:25.131]  Don't be a conspiracy theorist.
[02:04:47.541 --> 02:04:49.245]  I mean, he had an autopsy.
[02:04:49.245 --> 02:04:50.468]  I mean, they weren't secretive.
[02:04:50.468 --> 02:04:51.911]  I mean, well, they were.
[02:04:51.911 --> 02:04:54.697]  Well, he's not an important person, actually.
[02:04:54.697 --> 02:04:56.140]  One of the most.
[02:04:56.140 --> 02:04:56.641]  We'll be back.
[02:04:56.641 --> 02:04:57.082]  Stay with us.

[02:07:01.635 --> 02:07:03.237]  Rob Dew joins us.
[02:07:03.237 --> 02:07:06.341]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[02:07:06.341 --> 02:07:07.462]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[02:07:07.462 --> 02:07:08.403]  I've been working all day.
[02:07:08.403 --> 02:07:10.886]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:07:10.886 --> 02:07:12.308]  I get in here at 830.
[02:07:12.308 --> 02:07:14.210]  I was kind of run down.
[02:07:14.210 --> 02:07:15.932]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[02:07:16.132 --> 02:07:18.013]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:07:18.013 --> 02:07:19.834]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[02:07:19.834 --> 02:07:20.895]  I popped two of them.
[02:07:20.895 --> 02:07:23.176]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[02:07:23.176 --> 02:07:24.977]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:07:24.977 --> 02:07:26.638]  It's got four and a half stars.

[02:07:37.864 --> 02:07:41.887]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[02:07:41.887 --> 02:07:48.051]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.

[02:08:12.793 --> 02:08:17.216]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:17.216 --> 02:08:19.538]  Now you ought to hear the discussions behind the scenes because
[02:08:21.311 --> 02:08:32.321]  The author of Transformation America and a bunch of other people claim that they have larger ranches in Northern California and in Southern Texas where they hunt people and that Dick Cheney's involved.
[02:08:32.321 --> 02:08:40.908]  Now, I'm not saying that's happening here, but skulls everywhere, demons, people dying, thousands found across the border, sacrifice in that very area.
[02:08:40.908 --> 02:08:42.009]  We need to do a whole report on this.
[02:08:42.009 --> 02:08:43.910]  I remember when I was a kid reading Texas Monthly about
[02:08:44.671 --> 02:08:44.771]  Yes.
[02:08:44.771 --> 02:08:44.851]  Yes.
[02:09:00.112 --> 02:09:07.296]  Uh, he's down there, and then they have werewolves tearing babies apart and women apart, uh, with devils, devil masks everywhere.
[02:09:07.296 --> 02:09:09.458]  And Leanne, you were saying this creeped you out.
[02:09:09.458 --> 02:09:21.224]  Say what you said, and then I popped in with the Cheney thing and the hunting people, and then what Madsen said, Dave and I, then we're going back, uh, to, uh, to get a comment, uh, from Biggs, then to Jakari, then to Kit Daniels.
[02:09:21.224 --> 02:09:21.525]  Go ahead.
[02:09:22.264 --> 02:09:39.724]  Well I was just saying that what this really instantly prompted to my brain, I had just watched a werewolf movie and it was like this ancient order of ancient werewolves and they meet up once a year for their hunting party and they hunt people and they're like released out and this is like their
[02:09:40.325 --> 02:09:44.527]  You know, it's a high order of the werewolves, so that's what it made me think of.
[02:09:44.527 --> 02:09:50.009]  So, basically, if you... And then they got sculptures of werewolves tearing men, women, and children apart.
[02:09:50.009 --> 02:10:00.553]  And again, all that stuff of Dracula and werewolves, these allegories from Old Bavaria and the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the Czech Republic, right into Transylvania, where the elites did this.
[02:10:00.553 --> 02:10:02.094]  They bathed in people's blood.
[02:10:02.094 --> 02:10:05.115]  That's what Vlad the Impaler and his daughters... Exactly.
[02:10:05.715 --> 02:10:06.816]  Wayne Madsen kept looking at this.
[02:10:06.816 --> 02:10:08.857]  He goes, this is Cheney country.
[02:10:08.857 --> 02:10:12.418]  He goes, I know we can find a connection here to Dick Cheney, who was friends with Scalia.
[02:10:12.418 --> 02:10:14.139]  He goes, I know that he's there.
[02:10:14.139 --> 02:10:27.046]  But you know, when Biggs was talking about checking in, and it's kind of strange they don't give you a key to your room, but then also remember, Joe, they give us a release form saying, sign this, acknowledge that you are hours away from any medical care.
[02:10:27.046 --> 02:10:29.607]  You're coming here to engage in hunting and so forth and so on.
[02:10:29.867 --> 02:10:34.450]  We're gonna put green robes on and dance around fires right outside of a cemetery.
[02:10:34.450 --> 02:10:36.051]  That's not creepy or weird at all.
[02:10:36.051 --> 02:10:39.233]  Yeah, we haven't shown the footage yet of the shallow graves and the fires.
[02:10:39.233 --> 02:10:41.174]  Tell folks about the dancing around the fires, Biggs.
[02:10:41.174 --> 02:10:43.916]  No, no, no, I'm saying, I mean, I'm saying that's probably something they do.
[02:10:43.916 --> 02:10:45.858]  I mean, they say these guys wear green robes.
[02:10:45.858 --> 02:10:50.481]  I mean, you saw what happened in Bohemian Grove, because you were there, dancing around the fires and all that.
[02:10:50.481 --> 02:10:54.503]  They have fire pits out there at the Cibola Creek Ranch in the middle of nowhere.
[02:10:54.503 --> 02:10:56.665]  You're an hour in almost any direction from anything.
[02:10:57.185 --> 02:11:01.228]  You know, uh, like I said... Now wait, it's not like there's hundreds of devil masks, though.
[02:11:01.228 --> 02:11:02.870]  Yeah, I mean, it's not like... Well, of course there is.
[02:11:02.870 --> 02:11:12.197]  It's not like they have a ladder sitting on the, uh, on the side of that, uh, the kitchen in there, and they come over there and step up, and everyone chooses their mask and puts it on and dances around like a little fairy around that thing.
[02:11:12.197 --> 02:11:13.338]  I wanna go down there, man.
[02:11:13.338 --> 02:11:15.019]  This looks like something out of a horror movie.
[02:11:15.019 --> 02:11:15.440]  I wanna go.
[02:11:15.740 --> 02:11:20.003]  Well, it was also really weird that they had what for them was full-size beds.
[02:11:20.003 --> 02:11:21.084]  It was also strange.
[02:11:21.084 --> 02:11:24.587]  I've never stayed in a hotel before where all the beds are really tiny twin beds.
[02:11:24.587 --> 02:11:27.729]  I mean, this is a high-end hotel in terms of price, okay?
[02:11:27.729 --> 02:11:29.290]  And I'm fairly well-traveled.
[02:11:29.290 --> 02:11:32.573]  I've never seen anything like this where you don't get a key to your room.
[02:11:32.573 --> 02:11:33.513]  We weren't going there to hunt.
[02:11:33.513 --> 02:11:35.955]  We had to sign a release saying that everything was okay.
[02:11:35.955 --> 02:11:43.321]  And then we get to where the rooms are, and out in the hallway, there's all these beds with sheets and everything in the hallway.
[02:11:43.321 --> 02:11:44.962]  And it's like, this is really weird, you know?
[02:11:46.543 --> 02:11:51.326]  I know a lot about the occult and grips, but pop in, Beggs, pop in.
[02:11:51.326 --> 02:11:53.107]  This is a free-for-all.
[02:11:53.107 --> 02:11:54.728]  Jakar, everybody, turn everybody's mic on.
[02:11:54.728 --> 02:11:58.331]  What do you think's going on with the weird beds in the hallways?
[02:11:58.331 --> 02:12:02.534]  I mean, it seems like it's one of those things where they want to have things out on display.
[02:12:02.534 --> 02:12:10.299]  You know, a lot of these secret societies, they use these as ways to get dirt on people as well, too, and kind of hold things over them as well.
[02:12:10.299 --> 02:12:14.022]  I mean, this could be an area where they sit around, they have the couches, they sit there and watch
[02:12:14.702 --> 02:12:31.168]  Whatever weirdness is going on, and one of the first videos that we made while we were there, Secrets Inside the Cibola Creek Ranch that Josh Owens and I did, I said that he either died of natural causes, he was assassinated, or he was involved in something that they did not want to come out to the light that could possibly
[02:12:32.328 --> 02:12:37.250]  We know it's an Illuminati cult.
[02:12:37.250 --> 02:12:40.032]  This isn't a real Illuminati, as real as it gets, cult, folks.
[02:12:40.032 --> 02:12:43.033]  This isn't TV, this isn't movies, this is real world.
[02:12:43.033 --> 02:12:43.773]  Great point.
[02:12:43.773 --> 02:12:45.474]  Let's get Kit Daniels' take.
[02:12:45.474 --> 02:12:45.674]  Kit?
[02:12:45.674 --> 02:12:55.219]  Well, it's interesting to note that the Illuminati was founded in 1776 as a counter-reaction to the populist movement sweeping both the Thirteen Colonies and Europe at the time.
[02:12:55.999 --> 02:12:59.761]  And Scalia himself was kind of the figurehead of a populist movement today.
[02:12:59.761 --> 02:13:14.150]  He was part of the Federalist Society and he's going around college campuses, law schools around the country to encourage libertarian and conservative leaning law students to stick to a originalist interpretation of the Constitution.
[02:13:14.986 --> 02:13:21.070]  So, you know, the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, you know, they all stem from the American Revolution.
[02:13:21.070 --> 02:13:31.656]  So I think it's very interesting how the founding of the Illuminati really serves as a bookend to Scalia's death in this current time.
[02:13:31.656 --> 02:13:42.062]  And also I want to mention something that kind of Joe talked about to add on to his point was the Cibola Creek Ranch was started in, it was based off a private fort that was built in 1857.
[02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:55.289]  It was a like a big time rancher who's had this kind of this private empire that between Fort Davis and the border and that region was pretty much no man's land.
[02:13:55.289 --> 02:13:57.831]  It wasn't really I mean, it was part of the United States.
[02:13:57.831 --> 02:14:01.354]  This is part of the state of Texas, but it's kind of anarchy in a way.
[02:14:02.034 --> 02:14:07.597]  So you kind of have this, this whole area has always been this region of Texas and the U.S.
[02:14:07.597 --> 02:14:11.539]  It's kind of this no man's land where laws don't really apply.
[02:14:11.539 --> 02:14:15.462]  And I mean, in this case, what we saw with the sheriff and the county judge, the law really didn't apply.
[02:14:15.462 --> 02:14:18.844]  Well, it makes sense, though, too, now that the the manager there on the ground, George
[02:14:19.924 --> 02:14:21.945]  Uh, I was the first one on scene for dinner.
[02:14:21.945 --> 02:14:27.766]  You know, I like to eat, you know, so I'm sitting there and it's their cocktail time at 630 and George is on the phone.
[02:14:27.766 --> 02:14:32.787]  He's face timing with his wife and he's being very loud on purpose and his wife asked, Hey, how are you doing?
[02:14:32.787 --> 02:14:34.967]  He goes, uh, not really a good day.
[02:14:34.967 --> 02:14:41.229]  He's like, we got these, uh, extreme right wingers in here, uh, digging around trying to spread a conspiracy theories.
[02:14:41.849 --> 02:14:42.710]  Yeah, okay, buddy.
[02:14:42.710 --> 02:14:43.331]  Well, you were.
[02:14:43.331 --> 02:14:45.673]  You were nervous because we were going to find something.
[02:14:45.673 --> 02:14:50.438]  Someone was going to find something about your little green robe dancing around fires with satanic masks.
[02:14:50.438 --> 02:14:51.620]  Well, I need to go down there.
[02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:52.320]  Let me say this.
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:54.182]  The individuals even running it may not be involved.
[02:14:54.182 --> 02:14:54.983]  We have to be clear.
[02:14:54.983 --> 02:14:56.985]  Scalia probably wasn't involved.
[02:14:56.985 --> 02:14:57.966]  But this is how cults work.
[02:14:58.647 --> 02:15:03.789]  You get 30-something people together at a private place in the middle of nowhere, that's the reason you're in a cult.
[02:15:03.789 --> 02:15:10.052]  You can all be witnesses for each other, script it, and the way he talked to the press, it was all scripted on purpose.
[02:15:10.052 --> 02:15:13.153]  As an investigator, we know what we're seeing when something's clearly scripted too much.
[02:15:13.153 --> 02:15:19.496]  If this was over-the-top scripted, like a bad school play, so that was the big red flag for us.
[02:15:20.336 --> 02:15:27.582]  And then it's perfect, in a secret cult, to get somebody in that thinks they're part of a Catholic order, you know, of hunting.
[02:15:27.582 --> 02:15:28.783]  And then, boom, he's gone.
[02:15:28.783 --> 02:15:32.345]  But really, it's the Bohemian Grove taking that order over.
[02:15:32.345 --> 02:15:35.868]  That's what the Bohemian Grove does, is the kingdom of the cults.
[02:15:35.868 --> 02:15:36.929]  It's a book on this.
[02:15:36.929 --> 02:15:38.110]  That's how they control stuff.
[02:15:38.110 --> 02:15:40.872]  I want to go to Jakari Jackson, because I drug him in here.
[02:15:40.872 --> 02:15:42.153]  I want to get his take on this.
[02:15:42.153 --> 02:15:42.573]  Jakari?
[02:15:43.354 --> 02:15:44.715]  You've been watching the reportage.
[02:15:44.715 --> 02:15:45.915]  You've been covering it.
[02:15:45.915 --> 02:15:48.856]  You've been seeing us send five reporters down there to the border.
[02:15:48.856 --> 02:15:51.517]  What is your overall take as an investigative journalist on this?
[02:15:51.517 --> 02:15:55.518]  I mean, if you had questions before, does this make you have more?
[02:15:55.518 --> 02:15:56.319]  What's going on here?
[02:15:56.319 --> 02:15:57.279]  I mean, this is getting weird.
[02:15:58.095 --> 02:16:03.556]  Oh, I've yet to be convinced that anybody killed Justice Scalia.
[02:16:03.556 --> 02:16:09.238]  I look at a 79-year-old man who died with a pillow over his head.
[02:16:09.238 --> 02:16:15.900]  I mean, I guess that's a notable thing to say, but it's not indicative of any foul play on anybody's part.
[02:16:15.900 --> 02:16:24.302]  As far as the secret societies are concerned, I don't keep up with secret societies or, you know, all that kind of deal, so I can't really touch too much on that topic.
[02:16:25.950 --> 02:16:29.496]  Well, I wanted to get your view just overall on the story changing so much.
[02:16:29.496 --> 02:16:31.379]  No autopsy.
[02:16:31.379 --> 02:16:32.261]  I mean, all of this.
[02:16:32.261 --> 02:16:38.251]  I mean, why would there be some type of investigation of any type with a Supreme Court justice dying?
[02:16:39.264 --> 02:16:51.026]  Well, I believe it was Skidded pointing out that they did violate their own policy by not conducting a autopsy on the man, but personally, if somebody in my family died at age 79, I wouldn't demand an autopsy.
[02:16:51.026 --> 02:16:57.247]  Well, the FBI said the reason that they're not doing an investigation is based off the testimony they got from the U.S.
[02:16:57.247 --> 02:16:57.907]  Marshals.
[02:16:57.907 --> 02:16:58.248]  The U.S.
[02:16:58.248 --> 02:17:06.029]  Marshal that showed up had no training whatsoever in conducting that type of... Yeah, this is not your average 79-year-old person is the problem.
[02:17:06.249 --> 02:17:10.254]  Yeah, they're also saying that it was a sheriff who showed up and gave them information.
[02:17:10.254 --> 02:17:16.501]  But you know, it's interesting, I think, Alex, as we point out, we only know four other people besides Scalia who were there at the time.
[02:17:16.501 --> 02:17:18.623]  We know there were 36 people total.
[02:17:18.623 --> 02:17:20.145]  They were very secret about the names.
[02:17:21.186 --> 02:17:23.207]  Those were leaders or former leaders.
[02:17:23.207 --> 02:17:27.209]  Poindexter, who owns the hotel, is a leader of the organization.
[02:17:27.209 --> 02:17:32.512]  He told reporters in the Washington Post that he met Scalia at a, quote, sports group gathering in Washington.
[02:17:32.512 --> 02:17:34.974]  That's what they will do, is pull people in for influence.
[02:17:34.974 --> 02:17:38.556]  And many people have brought up the question, is there influence peddling going on here?
[02:17:38.556 --> 02:17:43.339]  There were people that were involved there that, you know, he could hear their cases.
[02:17:43.339 --> 02:17:45.060]  Maybe they had come up before.
[02:17:45.060 --> 02:17:46.701]  Sure, all of this should be investigated.
[02:17:47.461 --> 02:17:48.461]  The security detail wasn't there.
[02:17:48.461 --> 02:17:50.982]  There were private jets that he came in on waiting.
[02:17:50.982 --> 02:17:52.243]  Why was he flown out on those?
[02:17:52.243 --> 02:17:55.384]  This is just... The security detail follows him to Houston.
[02:17:55.384 --> 02:17:59.786]  They were with him when he was getting his hair cut in Dallas three weeks earlier and then... Hold on a second.
[02:17:59.786 --> 02:18:00.947]  Kit, Kit, go ahead.
[02:18:00.947 --> 02:18:04.388]  No, I was saying, this is Biggs, I was saying there's a reason that the security team, the U.S.
[02:18:04.388 --> 02:18:10.370]  Marshals, didn't go because they didn't want Scalia, Poindexter, didn't want these people to see what's really going on.
[02:18:10.370 --> 02:18:10.711]  Exactly.
[02:18:10.711 --> 02:18:12.451]  They want them to think that this is just a hunting trip.
[02:18:12.451 --> 02:18:13.712]  There's a major cover-up or something.
[02:18:14.232 --> 02:18:16.954]  Well, they go everywhere with him except to this particular place.
[02:18:16.954 --> 02:18:19.016]  They were in Dallas, they were with him in Houston.
[02:18:19.016 --> 02:18:20.757]  That right there screens everything right there.
[02:18:20.757 --> 02:18:34.167]  Well, what I thought was really interesting, you pointed out someone sent you a cartoon on Twitter that I guess a local magazine there in Marfa or something had put this cartoon and it was like, it said, oh, looks like those reporters are poking around again looking for clues.
[02:18:34.167 --> 02:18:36.909]  Seems like they should ask someone that was at the party.
[02:18:36.909 --> 02:18:37.910]  They would probably know.
[02:18:38.610 --> 02:18:46.555]  Like, it was this cryptic cartoon basically telling these guys, hey, get in touch with someone who was there because we probably know what was going on.
[02:18:46.555 --> 02:18:47.896]  Well, here's the big enchilada.
[02:18:47.896 --> 02:18:50.677]  We're going to come back and do one more segment, then I've got another guest joining us.
[02:18:50.677 --> 02:18:53.999]  She was a former prosecutor who thinks there's a lot of stuff going on here.
[02:18:53.999 --> 02:18:56.721]  Obviously, standard operating procedure was ignored.
[02:18:56.721 --> 02:18:59.042]  But I want to talk a little bit of Trump with all of you on the other side.
[02:19:00.623 --> 02:19:03.224]  So I want to get everybody's brief take on that straight ahead.
[02:19:03.224 --> 02:19:06.525]  But here's the big enchilada that everybody has to look at and understand.
[02:19:06.525 --> 02:19:14.167]  They wouldn't be bringing this out in the Washington Post all of a sudden when this had already died down if they didn't know there was a criminal investigation coming and a private investigation.
[02:19:14.167 --> 02:19:19.169]  That's what Larry Nichols told us and he talked to a Supreme Court Justice last week and again yesterday.
[02:19:19.169 --> 02:19:20.610]  And they had feds outside his house.
[02:19:20.610 --> 02:19:22.510]  So this is real.
[02:19:22.510 --> 02:19:24.531]  This is a big, big deal.
[02:19:24.531 --> 02:19:27.192]  And again, why are they coming out with this now?
[02:19:28.903 --> 02:19:43.529]  Well, I kind of, you know, I don't want to put any accusations out there, but I kind of get the vibe of what's going on in the UK with that sort of Elm Street horror story with the high-ups and bringing in the kids from the homes kind of vibe I get.
[02:19:43.789 --> 02:19:46.072]  Yeah, the elite are just into some really bad stuff.
[02:19:46.072 --> 02:19:47.734]  Undoubtedly, something big's going on here.
[02:19:47.734 --> 02:19:49.596]  Are they covering up some rituals?
[02:19:49.596 --> 02:19:52.098]  Are they covering up women being there?
[02:19:52.098 --> 02:19:53.040]  What are they covering up?
[02:19:53.040 --> 02:19:53.820]  Or was he killed?
[02:19:53.820 --> 02:19:55.522]  I mean, something's being covered up.
[02:19:55.522 --> 02:19:56.944]  But forget the hundreds of devil masks.
[02:19:56.944 --> 02:19:57.525]  They're no big deal.
[02:19:57.525 --> 02:19:58.105]  We'll be back.
[02:19:58.105 --> 02:19:58.746]  Totally normal.
[02:19:58.746 --> 02:20:00.307]  Are you looking to sell body armor?

[02:20:58.308 --> 02:21:00.390]  Brain Force, it's completely different.
[02:21:00.390 --> 02:21:01.610]  Try a bottle of it.
[02:21:01.610 --> 02:21:03.211]  Rob Dew joins us.
[02:21:03.211 --> 02:21:06.334]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[02:21:06.334 --> 02:21:07.414]  Tell us what Brain Force did.
[02:21:07.414 --> 02:21:08.355]  I'd been working all day.
[02:21:08.355 --> 02:21:10.857]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[02:21:10.857 --> 02:21:12.258]  I get in here at 830.
[02:21:12.258 --> 02:21:14.179]  I was kind of run down.
[02:21:14.179 --> 02:21:16.120]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:18.001]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[02:21:18.001 --> 02:21:19.843]  I got my bottle of Brain Force right there.
[02:21:19.843 --> 02:21:20.883]  I popped two of them.
[02:21:20.883 --> 02:21:23.165]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing!
[02:21:23.165 --> 02:21:25.066]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[02:21:25.066 --> 02:21:26.627]  It's got four and a half stars.
[02:21:26.627 --> 02:21:27.608]  People really love it.
[02:21:27.928 --> 02:21:37.854]  Read about it, find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise, because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[02:21:37.854 --> 02:21:41.877]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[02:21:41.877 --> 02:21:48.021]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[02:21:48.021 --> 02:21:53.924]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:21:58.393 --> 02:22:09.276]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?

[02:22:15.618 --> 02:22:21.060]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:22:21.240 --> 02:22:31.264]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.

[02:22:41.109 --> 02:22:43.170]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:22:43.170 --> 02:22:46.271]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:22:46.291 --> 02:22:48.772]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.

[02:23:27.526 --> 02:23:30.588]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[02:23:30.588 --> 02:23:33.229]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[02:23:33.229 --> 02:23:33.970]  Croix River.
[02:23:33.970 --> 02:23:36.191]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[02:23:36.191 --> 02:23:39.153]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[02:23:39.153 --> 02:23:40.034]  His excuse?
[02:23:40.034 --> 02:23:41.374]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[02:23:41.374 --> 02:23:42.975]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[02:23:42.975 --> 02:23:48.739]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.
[02:23:48.739 --> 02:23:49.779]  Don't wait.

[02:24:32.952 --> 02:24:34.032]  All right, final segment.
[02:24:34.032 --> 02:24:36.133]  I got four reporters here.
[02:24:36.133 --> 02:24:36.853]  I've got comments.
[02:24:36.853 --> 02:24:38.033]  That's about a minute apiece.
[02:24:38.033 --> 02:24:39.574]  I wanted to ask you guys about Trump.
[02:24:39.574 --> 02:24:42.655]  The New York Times writer saying somebody ought to kill him.
[02:24:42.655 --> 02:24:43.275]  Unprecedented.
[02:24:43.275 --> 02:24:45.275]  That article's on Infowars.com.
[02:24:45.275 --> 02:24:53.738]  So quick comment, Leanne, on that and then other points on this Bohemian Grove facility with the little beds outside the door and no locks on the doors.
[02:24:53.738 --> 02:24:57.519]  And, you know, Madsen had comments on what he thought was going on there.
[02:24:57.519 --> 02:25:01.700]  I'm not going to repeat this on air, but I think folks can put two and two together.
[02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:01.980]  Leanne?
[02:25:02.677 --> 02:25:07.440]  Well I think it's, I mean tonight's probably going to be a good debate.
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:11.543]  They get kind of mundane after a while but I think it's going to be really good with Trump.
[02:25:11.543 --> 02:25:14.606]  Infowars.com forward slash show for the free feed starts 7 o'clock.
[02:25:14.606 --> 02:25:23.232]  These other guys are just fighting for scraps at this point and now the New York Times, someone from the New York Times is making a death threat and getting away with it.
[02:25:23.652 --> 02:25:24.713]  They're desperate.
[02:25:24.713 --> 02:25:31.117]  Marco Rubio, new poll came out, shows him losing 16 points to Trump in his home state as a seated senator.
[02:25:31.117 --> 02:25:32.658]  Same thing with Cruz.
[02:25:32.658 --> 02:25:34.879]  He's now lost his lead as just one point over Trump.
[02:25:34.879 --> 02:25:36.500]  So their backs are against the wall, Alex.
[02:25:36.500 --> 02:25:38.021]  This is a do-or-die situation.
[02:25:38.021 --> 02:25:40.763]  And you're talking about assassination threats and all this kind of stuff.
[02:25:40.763 --> 02:25:43.465]  It's going to be assassination of the character time tonight.
[02:25:43.465 --> 02:25:44.986]  They don't have anywhere else to go.
[02:25:44.986 --> 02:25:46.187]  This is it.
[02:25:46.187 --> 02:25:47.207]  This is the ballgame tonight.
[02:25:47.207 --> 02:25:49.869]  They're going to be coming, throwing pretty much everything they've got.
[02:25:50.049 --> 02:25:53.172]  Right, and Clinton hasn't even addressed her opponent.
[02:25:53.172 --> 02:25:56.874]  She's aiming all, everything's going to Trump now.
[02:25:56.874 --> 02:25:57.995]  She knows that's the one.
[02:25:57.995 --> 02:26:02.219]  Alright, let's get a final comment from Kit Daniels and then Joe Biggs.
[02:26:02.219 --> 02:26:10.465]  Yeah, I mean if a reporter back in 2008 made a death threat or assassination joke about Obama, the New York Times would be calling for his resignation.
[02:26:10.465 --> 02:26:14.509]  They'd probably put in a front page op-ed calling this reporter out.
[02:26:15.347 --> 02:26:20.829]  So, I mean, it's just typical political assassination and, you know, just plain politics.
[02:26:20.829 --> 02:26:28.291]  Yeah, no one was allowed to talk about Hitler and Obama back in 2008-2012, but now so many articles are like Trump, Nazis, Hitler.
[02:26:28.291 --> 02:26:29.511]  It's just so bizarre.
[02:26:29.511 --> 02:26:32.652]  Yeah, well, it's also very racist because he is German.
[02:26:34.175 --> 02:26:38.837]  Yeah, the far left can refer to an assassination joke to a presidential candidate.
[02:26:38.837 --> 02:26:43.998]  Meanwhile, if I say something about Hillary Clinton, Secret Service will be busting down my door and throwing me in jail.
[02:26:43.998 --> 02:26:51.141]  Meanwhile, you know, she leaves a whole bunch of soldiers behind, private military contractors lets some people die in Benghazi.
[02:26:51.141 --> 02:26:53.361]  She lies about everything, but that's okay.
[02:26:53.361 --> 02:27:00.504]  We should vote for her because she's a woman and other women have the same genitalia as her, so that's why you should vote for her.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:05.238]  All I know is, now knowing about this ranch, this place is a freak show.
[02:27:05.959 --> 02:27:08.000]  Yeah, Alex, I wanted to point something out.
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:14.683]  Like, over by the beds in the hallway, which is already weird in itself, they have all these bookshelves.
[02:27:14.683 --> 02:27:17.545]  And all the books, you know, this is a ranch, you know, Southwest Ranch.
[02:27:17.545 --> 02:27:20.046]  You'd think it would be about Texas and ranching and this and that.
[02:27:20.046 --> 02:27:21.066]  Some of them were.
[02:27:21.066 --> 02:27:28.009]  But a lot of the books were like on, for example, Byzantium by John Julius Norwich, which actually I have a copy of that myself at my house.
[02:27:28.009 --> 02:27:33.032]  Solomon the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire, the Republic of Venice, Medieval Sicily.
[02:27:34.153 --> 02:27:43.102]  I mean, these are all kind of the whole statecraft, Machiavellian, kind of geopolitical, fall of empires, rise of empires style of books.
[02:27:43.102 --> 02:27:53.292]  And what's really interesting, a lot of these books are based in Eastern Europe, which was kind of the same sphere of influence as not only the Hungarian-Austrian Empire and the Holy Roman Empire,
[02:27:54.013 --> 02:27:56.554]  But also kind of where Transylvania was at.
[02:27:56.554 --> 02:27:59.515]  And that's where Prince Charles lives half the year now in Transylvania.
[02:27:59.515 --> 02:28:01.436]  He's directly related to Vlad the Impaler.
[02:28:01.436 --> 02:28:02.817]  They're not even a German royal family.
[02:28:02.817 --> 02:28:03.997]  They're a Transylvanian royal family.
[02:28:03.997 --> 02:28:06.559]  And that's that whole Bohemian angle.
[02:28:06.559 --> 02:28:06.999]  Exactly.
[02:28:06.999 --> 02:28:08.819]  That's where this cult comes from.
[02:28:08.819 --> 02:28:11.201]  The head of the order is an archduke from Austria.
[02:28:11.201 --> 02:28:14.362]  He's a prince of Hungary, Tuscany, and Bohemia.
[02:28:14.622 --> 02:28:25.547]  You know, and he's the one who came here six years ago as part of that hunting trip that they had at the time then, at the ranch, and now I believe... Just Archdukes and hundreds of devil masks, no big deal.
[02:28:25.547 --> 02:28:28.229]  Just a very pure bloodline, it's just perfectly fine.
[02:28:29.391 --> 02:28:30.292]  It was crazy.
[02:28:30.292 --> 02:28:32.273]  We were laughing about that tummy comment.
[02:28:32.273 --> 02:28:34.714]  Wayne Madsen was really going off on the tummy comment.
[02:28:34.714 --> 02:28:37.196]  It's like, he had a nice night, good tummy.
[02:28:37.196 --> 02:28:40.457]  I didn't know him, I'm just in the secret society with him.
[02:28:40.457 --> 02:28:45.220]  George's manager is in the same room where we are and he gives him a cold stare and gets up and leaves.
[02:28:45.220 --> 02:28:47.201]  What kind of a grown man talks about tummies?
[02:28:47.201 --> 02:28:48.622]  I've got a full tummy.
[02:28:48.622 --> 02:28:49.862]  So let me ask everybody.
[02:28:49.862 --> 02:28:51.523]  Paul Watson's doing an article on this.
[02:28:51.523 --> 02:28:52.164]  What's the headline?
[02:28:53.024 --> 02:28:55.126]  Scalia didn't die in a hunting cult.
[02:28:55.126 --> 02:28:56.307]  It was an Illuminati cult.
[02:28:56.307 --> 02:28:58.169]  I mean, I mean, how do you express something this crazy?
[02:28:58.169 --> 02:29:02.432]  I was thinking myself some of them along the lines of Scalia death linked to Bohemian Grove Illuminati.
[02:29:02.432 --> 02:29:04.114]  Yeah, that's it.
[02:29:04.114 --> 02:29:06.796]  I mean, I mean, Scalia death linked to a real Illuminati.
[02:29:06.796 --> 02:29:08.858]  And then you explain this is the Illuminati.
[02:29:08.858 --> 02:29:10.239]  People keep looking for it, folks.
[02:29:10.239 --> 02:29:10.940]  It's real.
[02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:11.941]  The bloodline is there.
[02:29:11.941 --> 02:29:13.942]  That's why it's so exciting to me.
[02:29:13.942 --> 02:29:14.763]  Finally after 10 days.
[02:29:14.763 --> 02:29:15.124]  It is.
[02:29:15.124 --> 02:29:15.624]  It's incredible.
[02:29:15.624 --> 02:29:17.225]  I'm glad you think this is a big deal.
[02:29:17.225 --> 02:29:18.346]  People are like, oh, big deal.
[02:29:18.346 --> 02:29:19.067]  Royalty and
[02:29:19.307 --> 02:29:28.792]  I mean, I was up till 2 in the morning watching your Bohemian Grove documentary last night, trying to get myself back into the whole swing of things, thinking about this stuff.
[02:29:28.792 --> 02:29:36.117]  I mean, when you get that deep feeling inside your body, and then all of a sudden it comes out that you were right, you know, that's the most eerie thing.
[02:29:36.117 --> 02:29:39.218]  I haven't even watched the new X-Files yet, because it reminds me of too much work.
[02:29:39.218 --> 02:29:39.979]  When I get home after...
[02:29:40.499 --> 02:29:42.740]  You're living the X-Files, brother.
[02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:44.321]  That's why it's based on us.
[02:29:44.321 --> 02:29:45.162]  We'll be back.
[02:29:45.162 --> 02:29:45.802]  Stay with us.
[02:29:45.802 --> 02:29:46.703]  We've got another guest coming up.
[02:29:46.703 --> 02:29:47.303]  Great job, crew.
[02:30:00.649 --> 02:30:04.013]  Marco Rubio, Wall Street's boy toy.
[02:30:04.013 --> 02:30:09.600]  He's gotten more money from the elite donors in Wall Street than number two Jeb or even number three Hillary.
[02:30:09.600 --> 02:30:13.324]  After blowing 150 million dollars on Jeb, they still haven't learned anything.
[02:30:15.049 --> 02:30:17.432]  Jeb's dropping out didn't help Rubio in Nevada.
[02:30:17.432 --> 02:30:20.737]  Rubio is the establishment's 20% solution.
[02:30:20.737 --> 02:30:25.303]  Jeb had a sense of entitlement, kind of like the donor class and the party elite that support Rubio.
[02:30:25.303 --> 02:30:29.729]  They believe they can openly oppose the voters on their key issues and still win.
[02:30:29.729 --> 02:30:31.171]  But Rubio is a little smarter.
[02:30:31.591 --> 02:30:37.115]  He realizes that his support for illegal immigration with the Gang of Eight was a betrayal of the voters.
[02:30:37.115 --> 02:30:39.797]  But he still thinks they're too stupid to see through the lies.
[02:30:39.797 --> 02:30:47.704]  He's called Breitbart a conspiracy website and the president of the Ice Union a liar when they exposed Rubio's betrayal with the Gang of Eight.
[02:30:47.704 --> 02:30:55.409]  But Rubio's campaign will provide a useful public service, identifying the GOP political class who will say anything to get elected.
[02:30:55.409 --> 02:30:57.211]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[02:30:58.652 --> 02:31:04.418]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits, built-up toxins, and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.
[02:31:04.418 --> 02:31:18.853]  We worked with the top developers in the field of detox to take tried and true herbs and other compounds known to safely cleanse the liver and fused it with the latest research and technological development on concentrating these ingredients to give you the maximum effect.
[02:31:19.113 --> 02:31:27.115]  Liver Shield is the only liver support product on the market that uses a patented Spigyrex blend of powerful organic herbs that support detoxification.
[02:31:27.115 --> 02:31:32.596]  And when you visit InfoWarsLife.com, see the instructional video on how to do a six-day liver detox.
[02:31:32.596 --> 02:31:36.237]  This isn't a game, and let me tell you, the results are dramatic.
[02:31:36.237 --> 02:31:40.378]  Liver Shield is totally organic and made of the safest, high-quality herbs.
[02:31:40.378 --> 02:31:44.259]  But that said, you need to consult your physician before you do the full detox.
[02:31:44.599 --> 02:31:47.682]  Hey everyone, Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side.
[02:31:47.682 --> 02:31:51.766]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[02:31:51.766 --> 02:31:53.428]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[02:32:07.461 --> 02:32:17.730]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[02:32:17.730 --> 02:32:23.716]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[02:32:24.176 --> 02:32:39.053]  If you're dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino
[02:32:39.053 --> 02:32:39.534]  I think so.
[02:33:11.770 --> 02:33:18.083]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:21.053 --> 02:33:23.874]  I tell you, I hardly ever call coast-to-coast and ask to go on.
[02:33:23.874 --> 02:33:28.715]  I love the show, I listen to the show, but I'm gonna call George Norrie or Dan Heiser today and say, hey, I'd like to come on.
[02:33:28.715 --> 02:33:35.778]  I know you have your show already booked tonight, but in the first hour or tomorrow about Bohemian Grove and this death out there, because this is right up their alley.
[02:33:35.778 --> 02:33:38.959]  I mean, this is, this is like a movie.
[02:33:38.959 --> 02:33:44.901]  You can get our film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and The Order of Death, two films, on one DVD at infowarestore.com.
[02:33:46.081 --> 02:33:48.745]  You want to really delve into this and understand what happened.
[02:33:48.745 --> 02:33:51.628]  I mean, this is the stuff that movies are made of.
[02:33:51.628 --> 02:33:55.433]  And we have a former prosecutor and defense lawyer as well.
[02:33:55.433 --> 02:33:58.797]  In another incarnation, syndicated radio host, TV host, Lionel.
[02:33:58.797 --> 02:34:01.241]  LionelMedia.com joining us for this segment.
[02:34:01.241 --> 02:34:02.642]  The next, we're going to him in a moment.
[02:34:03.583 --> 02:34:11.770]  And then we've got coming up, Anthony Gucciardi is hosting the fourth hour today and I may even hold over into some of that with him and get to the news I haven't gotten to.
[02:34:11.770 --> 02:34:19.156]  We've got New York Times death-threatening Trump, that's a top story up there as well, trying to get their forces out there to do that.
[02:34:19.156 --> 02:34:20.217]  But before I go any further,
[02:34:21.494 --> 02:34:27.323]  It is your purchases of books and videos and t-shirts and materiel that allows us to make more films.
[02:34:27.323 --> 02:34:33.211]  And notice how we're on top of the Scalia death, and we're on top of Bohemian Grove, and we're on top of the Fekir death-threatening Trump, and we're...
[02:34:34.398 --> 02:34:35.659]  We're leading the news.
[02:34:35.659 --> 02:34:37.080]  We're dominating the cycle.
[02:34:37.080 --> 02:34:38.321]  We're getting the threats.
[02:34:38.321 --> 02:34:39.362]  We're on the target.
[02:34:39.362 --> 02:34:40.363]  We're over the target.
[02:34:40.363 --> 02:34:50.711]  We are where you need to promote to your neighbors, your friends, your colleagues, your family, your church, your synagogue, your mosque, whatever, your bowling club, whatever it is.
[02:34:50.711 --> 02:34:52.012]  Infowars is over the target.
[02:34:52.012 --> 02:34:53.994]  We're as close to the truth as you're going to get.
[02:34:53.994 --> 02:34:55.955]  We don't have all the answers.
[02:34:55.955 --> 02:34:58.918]  And you see through rose-colored darkly, or scanner darkly, as the Bible says.
[02:35:00.302 --> 02:35:12.669]  But I'm looking for the truth, baby, and I've dug deep into it, and we know the pulse of these people, and we know their modus operandi, and let me tell you, the Pub Secretary just got found dead in a hammer pregnant in the offices.
[02:35:12.669 --> 02:35:18.712]  There's so many people getting killed around that Vatican, makes your head spin, and all the little kids in Boys Town and Penn State and...
[02:35:19.432 --> 02:35:20.032]  All of it?
[02:35:20.032 --> 02:35:23.653]  I mean, it's just a sick, filthy crew, folks.
[02:35:23.653 --> 02:35:25.334]  A sick, filthy crew.
[02:35:25.334 --> 02:35:28.054]  I mean, I look at little kids, I want to protect them and be good to them.
[02:35:28.054 --> 02:35:30.575]  I have zero sexual attraction.
[02:35:30.575 --> 02:35:33.076]  But that's because I'm not a devil worshipper.
[02:35:33.076 --> 02:35:36.957]  I mean, I like the most mature, feminine, super-powered woman I can get.
[02:35:37.717 --> 02:35:39.098]  I want Wonder Woman, man.
[02:35:39.098 --> 02:35:43.062]  I want the full, you know, challenging, you know, Buck and Bronco.
[02:35:43.062 --> 02:35:44.743]  And I don't mean sexually, you know what I mean?
[02:35:44.743 --> 02:35:47.686]  It's these weird little creepy little kids.
[02:35:47.686 --> 02:35:50.328]  I want to club their heads in, pedophiles, you know?
[02:35:50.328 --> 02:35:51.469]  I'm going to be honest with you.
[02:35:51.469 --> 02:35:53.932]  It's not that I want to kill people, but let me tell you, I got the strength to do it.
[02:35:55.162 --> 02:35:58.587]  Because my body's natural and healthy and wants to protect children.
[02:35:58.587 --> 02:36:00.350]  I want to expunge the earth of trash.
[02:36:00.350 --> 02:36:02.553]  And it's time to stop putting up with it.
[02:36:02.553 --> 02:36:08.942]  Now, briefly, if you want to fund this InfoWars News Kamikaze operation,
[02:36:10.011 --> 02:36:12.732]  You get high-quality nutraceuticals at Infowarslife.com.

[02:36:27.959 --> 02:36:30.080]  We've got the Liver Cleanse and Liver Shield.
[02:36:31.020 --> 02:36:33.062]  Back in with the Oxy Powder, proprietary.
[02:36:33.062 --> 02:36:34.983]  Amazing gallbladder and liver cleanse.
[02:36:34.983 --> 02:36:36.565]  Check out the informational videos on that.
[02:36:36.565 --> 02:36:40.408]  Winter Sun, great for in the winter and the spring and the fall.
[02:36:40.408 --> 02:36:42.329]  So much of the sickness is because you don't have the vitamin D3.
[02:36:42.329 --> 02:36:47.293]  It's the best under the tongue, sublingual, you're going to find out there, and so much more.
[02:36:47.293 --> 02:36:48.334]  So Liver Shield is back.
[02:36:48.934 --> 02:36:50.135]  We've got so much more.
[02:36:50.135 --> 02:36:55.960]  InfoWarsLife.com, InfoWarsStore.com, and a lot of other specials as well.
[02:36:55.960 --> 02:37:00.103]  10% off on all the water filtration systems with promo code WATER.
[02:37:00.103 --> 02:37:01.705]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:37:01.705 --> 02:37:04.106]  The new joint formula just came in two days ago.
[02:37:04.106 --> 02:37:05.728]  That was over a year in the development.
[02:37:05.728 --> 02:37:09.711]  Look at all the sourced organic, known compounds, nine of them.
[02:37:09.711 --> 02:37:15.155]  It'd cost you $40, $50, $60, $70 for another brand that has these concentrations that are organic.
[02:37:16.287 --> 02:37:18.068]  Nine different known compounds.
[02:37:18.068 --> 02:37:19.709]  It's not where you take one or take the other.
[02:37:19.709 --> 02:37:22.191]  It's nine of them that are known.
[02:37:22.191 --> 02:37:27.354]  Infowarslife.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:37:27.354 --> 02:37:30.856]  And you know when you fund us, you are funding dedicated.
[02:37:30.856 --> 02:37:35.620]  I mean, I woke up at six this morning and saw about the Scalia's death and the secret society.
[02:37:36.801 --> 02:37:40.863]  And was bouncing off the walls, calling everybody, working on it.
[02:37:40.863 --> 02:37:43.864]  I got here and I was like a race car blowing its engine to get on air.
[02:37:43.864 --> 02:37:46.285]  I mean, I just, I just could not believe it.
[02:37:46.285 --> 02:37:47.906]  It just never ends.
[02:37:47.906 --> 02:37:48.626]  Yeah.
[02:37:48.626 --> 02:37:50.147]  And just drives me up the wall.
[02:37:50.147 --> 02:37:55.609]  And David Knight's staying with us because he wanted to get to a point, I'll get to it with Lionel, because Lionel's been a criminal investigator and a prosecutor.
[02:37:56.349 --> 02:38:09.532]  About the sheriff's report not matching up, them changing the story, pointing Dexter at a black op commander, saying that he didn't know Scalia, now they're the top of the secret order, that's a spinoff of the Illuminati, in the encyclopedia.
[02:38:09.532 --> 02:38:14.573]  I mean, eyes wide shut, baby, here we are.
[02:38:14.573 --> 02:38:16.654]  This is it.
[02:38:16.654 --> 02:38:17.794]  And you just cannot
[02:38:19.457 --> 02:38:20.357]  Make this stuff up.
[02:38:20.357 --> 02:38:22.058]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:38:22.058 --> 02:38:28.580]  So Lionel joins us and I appreciate him joining us and putting his prosecutor hat on to go over this.
[02:38:28.580 --> 02:38:31.621]  Lionel, you've heard us set the table here.
[02:38:31.621 --> 02:38:34.382]  I hope he died of natural causes and maybe they were covering up.
[02:38:34.382 --> 02:38:37.283]  There were a few gals out at the place and they didn't want anybody to know about it.
[02:38:37.523 --> 02:38:40.145]  Not that he was with some gals on Valentine's Day, not with his wife.
[02:38:40.145 --> 02:38:41.166]  We're not saying that.
[02:38:41.166 --> 02:38:49.012]  All we're saying is, from somebody that studies criminology, I'm not professional like you, this looks like an Agatha Christie novel that stinks to high heaven.
[02:38:49.012 --> 02:38:50.513]  What do you say, Lionel?
[02:38:50.513 --> 02:38:56.577]  Well, I don't know right now, but first, I've got to tell you that I reacted this morning the way you did.
[02:38:56.577 --> 02:38:59.940]  When I'm reading about this thing which is
[02:39:01.024 --> 02:39:05.667]  Textbook Illuminati, as people call it.
[02:39:05.667 --> 02:39:18.156]  I don't know what people need to hear if they think this is the Sertoma Club, or the Lions Club, or some wacky group of folks, the Hunting Templar.
[02:39:18.156 --> 02:39:26.943]  I don't know if anybody even has the intellectual heft or the right pay grade to dig this.
[02:39:26.943 --> 02:39:29.524]  But Alex and David, since the beginning,
[02:39:30.425 --> 02:39:40.468]  If I walked in there, if somebody called me, and I'm just a regular prosecutor on duty, get a duty call, and I say, okay, what do we have here, as they say on TV?
[02:39:40.468 --> 02:39:42.128]  Oh, it's Antonin Scalia.
[02:39:42.128 --> 02:39:43.588]  Wait a minute.
[02:39:43.588 --> 02:39:46.129]  A conservative firebrake.
[02:39:46.129 --> 02:39:52.991]  Arguably the most significant, hated, loathed, and revered justice in the last quarter century at least.
[02:39:54.261 --> 02:39:55.421]  He's found dead.
[02:39:55.421 --> 02:39:58.723]  And let me make this one point extremely clear.
[02:39:58.723 --> 02:40:00.243]  What's the major motive?
[02:40:00.243 --> 02:40:03.844]  He had a pillow on his head!
[02:40:03.844 --> 02:40:12.807]  Now, I don't want to play Columbo or Quincy here, but I just want everybody to understand that he had a pillow on his head!
[02:40:12.807 --> 02:40:14.508]  Now, starting with that.
[02:40:15.310 --> 02:40:20.559]  Later on it changed Alex to, well it was near his head, next to his head, on his face, on his head.
[02:40:20.559 --> 02:40:22.542]  What this is, is, is me.
[02:40:22.542 --> 02:40:24.746]  He had a pillow on his head!
[02:40:24.746 --> 02:40:26.348]  Now, the next thing.
[02:40:27.387 --> 02:40:29.009]  Nobody would have moved.
[02:40:29.009 --> 02:40:30.810]  Everybody would have been locked down.
[02:40:30.810 --> 02:40:32.052]  Did anybody not show up?
[02:40:32.052 --> 02:40:33.613]  It's like Paulie in The Godfather.
[02:40:33.613 --> 02:40:35.295]  Did anybody not show up?
[02:40:35.295 --> 02:40:36.576]  Did anybody show up?
[02:40:36.576 --> 02:40:37.997]  Any new members of this?
[02:40:37.997 --> 02:40:39.198]  Who fed him?
[02:40:39.198 --> 02:40:41.681]  Any room service?
[02:40:41.681 --> 02:40:45.364]  Everybody's got to be questioned because the security detail wasn't there.
[02:40:45.364 --> 02:40:47.826]  And speaking of The Godfather,
[02:40:48.871 --> 02:40:51.752]  This is the old Bucetta, you know, with the pillowcase.
[02:40:51.752 --> 02:40:52.412]  You look for it.
[02:40:52.412 --> 02:40:53.472]  Now forget the autopsy.
[02:40:53.472 --> 02:40:56.173]  We keep saying autopsy, autopsy, autopsy.
[02:40:56.173 --> 02:40:57.193]  That's OK.
[02:40:57.193 --> 02:41:06.476]  But if the family, as is their criterion, if you will, as they want to do and could do, if you don't want to do an autopsy, then a couple of things need to be done.
[02:41:06.476 --> 02:41:10.497]  Number one, you need to draw blood from the heart immediately.
[02:41:11.497 --> 02:41:14.762]  He's dead, but we're not talking the Y incision.
[02:41:14.762 --> 02:41:18.587]  Draw blood from the heart, run a catheter into the bladder, and get urine.
[02:41:18.587 --> 02:41:20.630]  Do just a preliminary tox screen.
[02:41:20.630 --> 02:41:21.832]  Save that.
[02:41:21.832 --> 02:41:28.060]  Once the evidence is gone, once the body is cremated or embalmed, all evidence is done.
[02:41:28.661 --> 02:41:31.182]  Then you look under the eyes for petechial hemorrhaging.
[02:41:31.182 --> 02:41:42.744]  You have somebody who is barely conversant in forensic pathology just to see whether there are signs of suffocation, ligature, just to do a cursory review.
[02:41:42.744 --> 02:41:44.185]  No basics done.
[02:41:44.185 --> 02:41:45.825]  Stories all change.
[02:41:45.825 --> 02:41:47.465]  They rush to get rid of the body.
[02:41:47.465 --> 02:41:49.166]  They've got a private jet there waiting.
[02:41:49.166 --> 02:41:51.366]  Don't fly to Dallas 35 minutes away.
[02:41:51.366 --> 02:41:52.887]  San Antonio 25 minutes away.
[02:41:52.887 --> 02:41:54.407]  Houston an hour away.
[02:41:54.407 --> 02:41:56.228]  They don't do any of this.
[02:41:56.228 --> 02:41:57.868]  They just magically say,
[02:41:59.258 --> 02:42:03.981]  Hours after he's even announced dead, no autopsy, the family doesn't want it.
[02:42:03.981 --> 02:42:06.023]  As if the family just said, no autopsy by the way!
[02:42:06.023 --> 02:42:06.923]  No autopsy by the way!
[02:42:06.923 --> 02:42:09.365]  I mean, this whole thing is redonkulous.
[02:42:09.365 --> 02:42:19.172]  And what's amazing also is that how people believe that, first of all, this is replete with errors and errata.
[02:42:19.172 --> 02:42:19.673]  Number one.
[02:42:20.513 --> 02:42:26.776]  Look very carefully as to what the people say, what the actual reports are as they change.
[02:42:26.776 --> 02:42:29.337]  Nobody is getting their stories straight.
[02:42:29.337 --> 02:42:30.878]  And by the way... Let me ask you this, Lionel.
[02:42:30.878 --> 02:42:32.318]  I got to interrupt you because I know you're a prosecutor.
[02:42:32.318 --> 02:42:39.402]  You're going over the basics and all these top forensics people in New York and top detectives in DC are saying this is ridiculous.
[02:42:39.402 --> 02:42:40.842]  This stinks.
[02:42:40.842 --> 02:42:42.743]  I've never seen anything this ridiculous.
[02:42:42.743 --> 02:42:44.224]  And you've got all the stories changing.
[02:42:44.224 --> 02:42:46.065]  David right here went in front of the judges.
[02:42:46.065 --> 02:42:47.465]  They hid in their chambers.
[02:42:47.465 --> 02:42:48.085]  Yeah.
[02:42:48.085 --> 02:42:48.886]  But what about
[02:42:50.171 --> 02:43:07.253]  What about the fact that the timing of this, all the things he was involved in, all the things that he was doing, and the media criticizing everyone for daring to even ask, hey, we should have an autopsy, the way the media was unified behind that, and then Obama making a joke about it, Lionel?
[02:43:08.926 --> 02:43:11.427]  It's critical to everything, Alex.
[02:43:11.427 --> 02:43:15.789]  In addition to this, and let me just say, as you've said, I wasn't there.
[02:43:15.789 --> 02:43:17.930]  I'm not suspecting he was killed.
[02:43:17.930 --> 02:43:20.151]  I'm not anything.
[02:43:20.151 --> 02:43:24.413]  But the reason why you rule this out is to rule it out.
[02:43:24.413 --> 02:43:30.236]  Especially when, and let me be clear about this, there was a pillow on his head!
[02:43:30.236 --> 02:43:33.738]  If Obama was found dead in a remote hunting lodge, there'd be an autopsy and investigation.
[02:43:34.278 --> 02:43:54.839]  If Bernie Sanders, if Hillary Clinton, if somebody, if somebody that, and I hate to do this, because I hate to inject politics, but it works like this Alex, because he was this conservative firebrand, because so many people hated him, and to show you how much they hated him, read the social media response, the post-mortem, these horrible
[02:43:55.820 --> 02:43:57.161]  They were so happy he was killed.
[02:43:57.161 --> 02:43:59.343]  They said, now kill the other judges.
[02:43:59.343 --> 02:44:02.326]  Now kill, they said, Mr. Thomas.
[02:44:02.326 --> 02:44:07.011]  People ask me all the time, they'll say, Alex, who would want to, you know, this man harm?
[02:44:07.011 --> 02:44:09.013]  I'm saying, look at the reaction.
[02:44:09.013 --> 02:44:16.080]  But what I'm saying is that, you know, Alex, there was a show recently making a murder about Stephen Avery, and there is not a
[02:44:16.741 --> 02:44:23.945]  There's that term again, a conspiracy theory that people will not entertain because they like you.
[02:44:23.945 --> 02:44:24.185]  O.J.
[02:44:24.185 --> 02:44:31.628]  Simpson's on the FX Channel, and people are coming up with theories about the Sun and Al Cowlings because they like O.J.
[02:44:31.628 --> 02:44:33.269]  or because they find this interesting.
[02:44:33.269 --> 02:44:44.195]  However, these same people, when you come to a real-life, actual firebrand, they're instant pathologists, instant cardiologists, as they well, at 79 years old,
[02:44:45.336 --> 02:44:49.401]  They said the cause of death was this, but no one even saw, no one knew it was a heart attack.
[02:44:49.401 --> 02:44:50.783]  Then they changed it, it goes on and on.
[02:44:50.783 --> 02:44:59.675]  David Knight has some questions for you, Lionel, because you're a former prosecutor in a major city down in Florida and saw a lot of death and a lot of things going on.
[02:44:59.675 --> 02:45:01.057]  Go over this police report.
[02:45:01.277 --> 02:45:07.983]  Well, to underscore what you were just saying, Lionel, you know, he was 79, but we've got Bernie Sanders who's 75.
[02:45:07.983 --> 02:45:11.926]  If he were to die like this, would people say, well, we should have an investigation?
[02:45:11.926 --> 02:45:15.469]  But when you're talking about the fact that he's got a pillow over his head, then they change this.
[02:45:15.469 --> 02:45:18.552]  We just got out this report from the sheriff after 10 days.
[02:45:18.552 --> 02:45:19.813]  It's filled with inaccuracies.
[02:45:19.813 --> 02:45:22.575]  It's filled with contradictions of what the judge told us.
[02:45:22.575 --> 02:45:24.717]  We asked, what was the process here?
[02:45:24.717 --> 02:45:26.899]  And the first judge who was called, Bishop,
[02:45:28.040 --> 02:45:30.683]  Well, they called me, I couldn't go.
[02:45:30.683 --> 02:45:35.870]  So then I called the other judge, Bibi, and he couldn't go.
[02:45:35.870 --> 02:45:37.372]  So then we got Guevara.
[02:45:37.372 --> 02:45:43.259]  Now, in the report, the sheriff is saying, well, I called Bishop and then I called Guevara.
[02:45:43.339 --> 02:45:45.461]  So there's all these kinds of inaccuracies.
[02:45:45.461 --> 02:45:48.845]  And then the interesting thing too, one more and I'll get you to comment on this.
[02:45:48.845 --> 02:45:52.329]  They say there was a breathing apparatus present on the table next to the lamp.
[02:45:52.329 --> 02:45:54.451]  Now that would indicate perhaps sleep apnea.
[02:45:54.451 --> 02:45:58.676]  And yet he didn't have that on, but he was in the bed and they stressed this over and over again.
[02:45:58.676 --> 02:45:59.537]  He was in the bed.
[02:46:00.037 --> 02:46:05.104]  Covers were perfectly folded, his pajamas were not wrinkled, and that's the only thing they seem to be interested in.
[02:46:05.104 --> 02:46:06.245]  I don't want him to answer those.
[02:46:06.245 --> 02:46:07.527]  I don't want him to answer those.
[02:46:07.527 --> 02:46:08.989]  It's the clear scripting.
[02:46:08.989 --> 02:46:10.731]  Leanne just did this, you just did this.
[02:46:10.731 --> 02:46:13.135]  That's why I made the joke when I go to the bathroom.
[02:46:13.135 --> 02:46:14.496]  I said, I'm going to go pee-pee now.
[02:46:14.496 --> 02:46:15.878]  They don't talk like that in the real world.
[02:46:16.639 --> 02:46:37.979]  And then Leanne didn't quite get the joke and you did, but I was saying, yeah, no, it's the joke of, and he had a full tummy, the way it's all, he was a great man, a good evening he had, with us, the friends, I did not know him, but the full tummy was, he was amongst the number of our secret society, this guy talks like Count Dracula, I mean, it's so scripted, when I read the next morning,
[02:46:38.760 --> 02:46:40.881]  His account, it was so scripted.
[02:46:40.881 --> 02:46:43.062]  I mean, as an investigator, I'm a journalist.
[02:46:43.062 --> 02:46:44.302]  I've done a lot of investigating.
[02:46:44.302 --> 02:46:45.903]  I'm not a prosecutor like this guy.
[02:46:45.903 --> 02:46:52.045]  But all the cops have come out and said, this is as phony and synthetic as wax fruit.
[02:46:52.045 --> 02:46:54.666]  You can look at it and tell it's fake.
[02:46:54.666 --> 02:47:00.848]  But, you know, Alex, even if it wasn't, let's just assume this is what happened.
[02:47:00.848 --> 02:47:07.431]  And what we're seeing is, God forbid, just rife Texas incompetence.
[02:47:08.331 --> 02:47:19.636]  When you have anyone who dies, and by the way, let me just say this before I forget, and David brings up my point, we have people who on the Supreme Court, for the most part, tend to be older.
[02:47:19.636 --> 02:47:22.097]  Ruth Bader Ginsburg, what, 82 years old?
[02:47:22.097 --> 02:47:24.758]  The popes, the papacy, they tend to be older.
[02:47:24.758 --> 02:47:29.300]  Are we saying that we're going to give a pass to any Supreme Court justice, any pope?
[02:47:29.300 --> 02:47:32.421]  Sets a precedent that no one who's old gets an autopsy.
[02:47:32.421 --> 02:47:33.682]  Pre-game to kill everybody.
[02:47:33.682 --> 02:47:35.222]  Maybe gunshot wounds the leaders.
[02:47:35.222 --> 02:47:36.323]  We'll do autopsies.
[02:47:36.883 --> 02:47:39.585]  They all tend to be diabetic or they have coronary artery disease.
[02:47:39.585 --> 02:47:43.987]  But see, when you look at this Alex, just like for example, an arson.
[02:47:43.987 --> 02:47:50.511]  You can look at the arson and say, well that's one thing, but I want to go beyond the test for flammables.
[02:47:50.511 --> 02:47:51.972]  Tell me about this person.
[02:47:51.972 --> 02:47:53.373]  Well, he had insurance problems.
[02:47:53.533 --> 02:47:54.254]  Well, he had money problems.
[02:47:54.254 --> 02:47:55.194]  Yeah, look for motives.
[02:47:55.194 --> 02:47:55.555]  He's got a policy.
[02:47:55.555 --> 02:47:57.736]  Well, there's obviously motives to get rid of Scalia.
[02:47:57.736 --> 02:47:58.837]  And who has the motive?
[02:47:58.837 --> 02:47:59.878]  Then who has the means?
[02:47:59.878 --> 02:48:01.219]  And then who could have acted?
[02:48:01.219 --> 02:48:02.040]  Oh my gosh!
[02:48:02.040 --> 02:48:02.640]  All three!
[02:48:02.640 --> 02:48:03.721]  The perfect place!
[02:48:03.721 --> 02:48:20.235]  Black op commander, secret society, 30,000 acre ranch, in the middle of a satanic kingdom of voodoo, with the key guy at the key time, buddies with Obama, and then a total cover-up of all the facts, everything changing, and the blood dumped down the drain, and then the private jet's not used to get him out.
[02:48:20.235 --> 02:48:22.917]  The story's changing on and on and on and on.
[02:48:23.177 --> 02:48:25.739]  You'd have to be nuts to not say there's a cover-up.
[02:48:25.739 --> 02:48:28.561]  Was it sex and drugs?
[02:48:28.561 --> 02:48:30.083]  Was it Viagra?
[02:48:30.083 --> 02:48:30.843]  Who knows?
[02:48:30.843 --> 02:48:34.566]  I mean, all I know is they were covering this up day one.
[02:48:34.566 --> 02:48:38.709]  I'm telling you also, another thing people realize, you always have to ask this question.
[02:48:38.709 --> 02:48:42.092]  And I'm going to say again, I have no basis for this other than the Viagra.
[02:48:42.092 --> 02:48:42.492]  Me neither.
[02:48:42.492 --> 02:48:46.415]  I'm not saying that the hundreds of satanic devil masks on the wall did anything.
[02:48:46.415 --> 02:48:46.836]  They're loving.
[02:48:48.308 --> 02:48:49.309]  Everything's fine.
[02:48:49.309 --> 02:48:51.432]  Or the werewolves tearing small children apart.
[02:48:51.432 --> 02:48:52.714]  Werewolves eating children is no big deal.
[02:48:52.714 --> 02:48:54.816]  Let me remind you of this, Alex.
[02:48:54.816 --> 02:48:57.440]  He had a pillow on his head!
[02:48:57.440 --> 02:48:58.321]  Can we put the werewolves?
[02:48:58.321 --> 02:48:59.603]  What if he had a werewolf on his head?
[02:49:01.870 --> 02:49:08.236]  It would, it could look like Abbott and Costello, like a scene from, you know, there we go, with Peter Lorre.
[02:49:08.236 --> 02:49:10.137]  There's just shots of devils with dead kids.
[02:49:10.137 --> 02:49:11.719]  I mean, what's wrong with that?
[02:49:11.719 --> 02:49:23.269]  Now, the thing that I wonder also is people say, why would these family people, these family folks, and by the way, my heart goes out because this was a, this was a father and a grandfather and they loved him.
[02:49:23.269 --> 02:49:27.112]  And he was, he was a tremendous jurist, irrespective of what you think.
[02:49:27.873 --> 02:49:33.219]  The question I have is, you know, sometimes in history, family people are really quiet.
[02:49:33.219 --> 02:49:35.562]  You ever heard that Kennedy's ever talked about JFK?
[02:49:35.562 --> 02:49:36.603]  Well, let's expand on that.
[02:49:36.603 --> 02:49:38.346]  They've got letters now saying he was killed.
[02:49:38.346 --> 02:49:46.515]  I've talked to major rock stars and other famous people who had family killed, and the FBI came to them and said, you're going to say it's a lone gunman or we're going to kill you.
[02:49:47.316 --> 02:49:49.136]  And then I'm like, can I tell that story?
[02:49:49.136 --> 02:49:50.257]  No, you can't.
[02:49:50.257 --> 02:49:52.117]  Why are you telling me?
[02:49:52.117 --> 02:49:53.878]  Just so you know, they've already killed us.
[02:49:53.878 --> 02:49:54.918]  We're not going to speak out.
[02:49:54.918 --> 02:49:56.938]  But you can say vaguely this happened.
[02:49:56.938 --> 02:49:57.719]  So that's what they do.
[02:49:57.719 --> 02:50:01.299]  And I'm not saying the whole FBI, but they have special units.
[02:50:01.299 --> 02:50:06.761]  And they tell you, hey, if you talk about what happened with somebody that got shot, you're going to end up dead.
[02:50:06.761 --> 02:50:07.601]  Is that clear?
[02:50:07.601 --> 02:50:08.981]  Shut your mouth.
[02:50:08.981 --> 02:50:09.601]  So I'm sorry.
[02:50:09.601 --> 02:50:10.422]  Go ahead, Lionel.
[02:50:10.422 --> 02:50:14.223]  What I'm saying is sometimes family members, you know, we don't know what happens.
[02:50:18.598 --> 02:50:20.459]  This is not my story!
[02:50:20.459 --> 02:50:25.201]  So, when I pose questions, people turn to me all the time and say, well, who would want to kill him?
[02:50:25.201 --> 02:50:26.161]  Why would they do this?
[02:50:26.161 --> 02:50:28.062]  I said, it's not my story!
[02:50:28.062 --> 02:50:29.182]  It's your story!
[02:50:29.182 --> 02:50:30.103]  You tell me!
[02:50:30.103 --> 02:50:31.643]  I ask the questions!
[02:50:31.643 --> 02:50:32.804]  I'm trying to get to the bottom!
[02:50:32.804 --> 02:50:38.026]  You know, Alex, we're the only people in this country who, when we're trying to ferret out the truth... That's right!
[02:50:38.026 --> 02:50:40.767]  The default SOP was shut down.
[02:50:40.767 --> 02:50:41.848]  We're pointing it out.
[02:50:41.848 --> 02:50:42.148]  We don't...
[02:50:42.608 --> 02:50:51.241]  We don't think anything happened in the middle of the command base with the black op commander that's with Obama with the devil skulls and the werewolves eating children and the secret Illuminati society.
[02:50:51.241 --> 02:50:51.882]  None of that matters.
[02:50:51.882 --> 02:50:54.986]  There's nothing, there's nothing, there's nothing spooky here.
[02:50:54.986 --> 02:50:56.428]  We just wanted an investigation.
[02:50:59.281 --> 02:51:10.184]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:51:10.184 --> 02:51:14.366]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:51:14.366 --> 02:51:16.506]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:16.506 --> 02:51:21.968]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:51:22.128 --> 02:51:32.151]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes, and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:51:32.151 --> 02:51:38.653]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:51:38.653 --> 02:51:41.974]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for a diabetic.
[02:51:41.974 --> 02:51:44.055]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:51:44.055 --> 02:51:47.036]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:51:47.196 --> 02:51:49.678]  Heart and body extract gets results.

[02:54:25.239 --> 02:54:29.120]  Black Op commander in covert operations around the world.
[02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:31.361]  Best buddies with Obama, getting big awards.
[02:54:31.361 --> 02:54:35.422]  Key justice, just voted to not allow trillions in carbon taxes.
[02:54:35.422 --> 02:54:39.704]  About to vote to defend the Second Amendment, stop open borders.
[02:54:39.704 --> 02:54:42.164]  A strict constructionist magically dies in the middle of nowhere.
[02:54:42.164 --> 02:54:43.685]  There's all these conflicting stories.
[02:54:43.685 --> 02:54:45.366]  Pillow on the head.
[02:54:45.366 --> 02:54:46.826]  Hundreds of devil masks everywhere.
[02:54:46.826 --> 02:54:49.487]  Werewolves, sculptures, tearing babies apart with devils.
[02:54:51.286 --> 02:54:53.448]  Huge satanic community right over the border there.
[02:54:53.448 --> 02:54:58.513]  Massive human sacrifices going on that doesn't get any media coverage but is well known in Texas.
[02:54:58.513 --> 02:54:59.994]  And there's no investigation of any type.
[02:55:00.842 --> 02:55:01.943]  And I apologize, we're bad.
[02:55:01.943 --> 02:55:08.228]  I also said the left will probably try to kill Trump, and now the New York Times writer's come out and called for that.
[02:55:08.228 --> 02:55:10.830]  But again, I'm discredited for being dead on target, David Knight.
[02:55:10.830 --> 02:55:14.513]  You had another point you were making, that they started all the conspiracy theories first.
[02:55:14.513 --> 02:55:15.574]  They gave no facts.
[02:55:15.574 --> 02:55:16.615]  What are we supposed to do?
[02:55:16.615 --> 02:55:22.680]  I mean, like Lionel said, this sets the precedent when famous people die, or old people die, that it's just gotta be their old.
[02:55:24.492 --> 02:55:27.875]  We were the ones asking, why didn't you do an investigation?
[02:55:27.875 --> 02:55:29.836]  Where's the information?
[02:55:29.836 --> 02:55:43.348]  They're the ones offering the theories and talking about, oh we didn't need to do an investigation because his pajamas weren't wrinkled and the sheets were folded nice and neat and he was placed even though he's got exercise bands on the other side of the room.
[02:55:43.348 --> 02:55:49.473]  Why does this guy talk like somebody who's writing a child's parable or children's books?
[02:55:49.473 --> 02:55:49.714]  Lionel?
[02:55:51.044 --> 02:56:06.040]  I have no idea, and I also find it amazing that this man, who was active, who was out hunting, who was gallivanting as the folks would say around the world, peregrinating, perambulating,
[02:56:06.600 --> 02:56:26.084]  Tooling about, this is the most active man, who was the longest term, ready to go back, known for his vivacity and his joie de vivre, and yet at the same time, when that particular meme doesn't fit, he's a decrepit, obese, diabetic... Well yeah, they suddenly changed the story.
[02:56:26.084 --> 02:56:28.524]  Exactly, he was dead already actually.
[02:56:28.524 --> 02:56:32.685]  And I gotta say, he's getting sicker every day since he's been dead.
[02:56:33.385 --> 02:56:34.926]  Yeah, that's what you see coming up.
[02:56:34.926 --> 02:56:42.808]  At first, the first day, he's got the guy who traveled with him to Hong Kong and Singapore on this judicial trip saying, oh, he was so vital, he was movement.
[02:56:42.808 --> 02:56:48.491]  And then within a couple of days, he's talking about how he goes to Bohemia with royalty for other special events.
[02:56:48.491 --> 02:56:54.593]  But I want to also, you know, Alex, just to just to go back again, if I don't know how much you've watched this, but if you watch
[02:56:55.333 --> 02:56:56.434]  Making a murderer.
[02:56:56.434 --> 02:57:07.443]  You should hear how people in Reddit columns are reading transcripts and coming up with the most insane theories as to who killed Teresa Halbach.
[02:57:07.443 --> 02:57:13.008]  And this conspiracy ideation fits because they kind of like the person.
[02:57:13.008 --> 02:57:13.488]  O.J.
[02:57:13.488 --> 02:57:14.309]  Simpson.
[02:57:14.309 --> 02:57:16.611]  They were having the daughter killed, Nicole.
[02:57:16.611 --> 02:57:23.076]  They'll make up stuff that's flagrant because they just feel like it when something's cut and dry that something's being covered up.
[02:57:24.398 --> 02:57:32.800]  Or when they don't like the subject because a lot of the professional left loathes Scalia and never read an opinion!
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:38.801]  This is a man, by the way, who ruled along with Justice Thomas, 8-1, to throw out Florida's death penalty.
[02:57:38.801 --> 02:57:44.763]  This is a man who voted basically for violent videos, for flag burning.
[02:57:44.763 --> 02:57:53.805]  This man that you swore was this, and I don't agree with a lot of what he did, but this homophobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, cretinous
[02:57:54.085 --> 02:57:55.906]  He was not what the left was saying he was.
[02:57:55.906 --> 02:57:58.888]  LionelMedia.com, follow you at Twitter, at LionelMedia.
[02:57:58.888 --> 02:58:01.589]  Thank you so much Lionel, great job buddy.
[02:58:01.589 --> 02:58:07.213]  Well there's another prosecutor from Miss Agassiz down in Miami, breaking all this down.
[02:58:07.213 --> 02:58:09.414]  This is just default being ignored David Knight.
[02:58:09.654 --> 02:58:15.698]  I know you're going to be on tonight from 7 right through the debate with analysis Leanne, Jakari, yourself, McBreen, Dew.
[02:58:15.698 --> 02:58:19.140]  I'm going to be Skyping in as well, doing Facebook mentions tonight.
[02:58:19.140 --> 02:58:20.621]  This debate is going to be big.
[02:58:20.621 --> 02:58:24.203]  But there is a fourth hour coming up with Anthony Gucciardi.
[02:58:24.203 --> 02:58:30.726]  But first, we've got a couple special reports we haven't aired that are so important that we're going to air in the second segment before Anthony comes on.
[02:58:30.726 --> 02:58:32.868]  But I've got to put some bookends on all this.
[02:58:32.868 --> 02:58:34.849]  In 70 seconds with my good friend and co-host,
[02:58:35.189 --> 02:58:36.972]  David Knight, I'm Alex Jones.
[02:58:36.972 --> 02:58:40.698]  Infowars.com has got stories they don't want you to read or spread.
[02:58:40.698 --> 02:58:45.326]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[02:58:48.857 --> 02:58:52.820]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[02:58:52.820 --> 02:58:59.125]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[02:58:59.125 --> 02:59:06.111]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[02:59:06.411 --> 02:59:15.543]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[02:59:15.543 --> 02:59:21.711]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[02:59:21.711 --> 02:59:24.395]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[02:59:24.955 --> 02:59:26.416]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:59:59.949 --> 03:00:05.373]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:05.373 --> 03:00:08.115]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:00:08.115 --> 03:00:14.700]  There's an incredibly important special report I filed that hasn't aired yet, and that is Stealth Gun Confiscation Begins.
[03:00:14.700 --> 03:00:21.665]  That's gonna air at the start of the next segment for eight minutes, and Anshini Gucciardi is in for the balance of the next 45 minutes or so.
[03:00:21.665 --> 03:00:22.666]  So that's coming up.
[03:00:22.666 --> 03:00:23.927]  It's so important.
[03:00:23.927 --> 03:00:28.350]  We're gonna post the video to InfoWars.com as well, PrisonPlanet.com, help get it out to everybody.
[03:00:28.630 --> 03:00:35.035]  But David, getting past the Scalia stuff, that's why all the historians say and philosophers, truth is stranger than fiction.
[03:00:35.035 --> 03:00:46.444]  Moving past that now, putting bookends on it, I want to talk about something about Trump with you in the waning minutes of our investiture on this transmission, our time here.
[03:00:46.444 --> 03:00:52.728]  What do you overall think, this will allude to the public now, that the story, I actually think it may be a sophisticated psyop.
[03:00:52.728 --> 03:00:55.871]  I'm not saying it is, I don't think it is, but I'm having to look at this as
[03:00:57.082 --> 03:01:04.464]  They may have done all this to make us think they killed him as some weird psy-op to freak us out because it's so ridiculous.
[03:01:04.464 --> 03:01:08.705]  I mean, it is the most, this is tailored to make police think there's a cover-up.
[03:01:08.705 --> 03:01:09.326]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:01:09.326 --> 03:01:14.227]  It's very interesting that the Washington Post would be the ones to actually say, here are the institutional links.
[03:01:14.227 --> 03:01:17.348]  And they don't say who contacted them to have this info.
[03:01:17.348 --> 03:01:17.788]  That's right.
[03:01:17.788 --> 03:01:19.749]  The whole thing is just over the top.
[03:01:19.749 --> 03:01:20.429]  I'm sorry.
[03:01:20.429 --> 03:01:24.470]  Well, here's the link between Scalia and between Donald Trump, I think.
[03:01:24.963 --> 03:01:30.870]  There had just been a Supreme Court decision about the EPA regulations on coal that Obama was trying to push through.
[03:01:30.870 --> 03:01:31.991]  For trillions of the globalists.
[03:01:31.991 --> 03:01:35.795]  And Scalia was part of the 5-4 majority that rejected that.
[03:01:35.795 --> 03:01:39.519]  Now, and would reject that when it's going to be heard in the lower court.
[03:01:39.519 --> 03:01:43.364]  That's trillions the carbon taxers will lose in the next 30 years because of that one vote.
[03:01:43.564 --> 03:01:44.925]  They put a stay on it.
[03:01:44.925 --> 03:01:45.605]  They didn't reject it.
[03:01:45.605 --> 03:01:48.647]  It's going to be heard in June, but they put a stay on these regulations.
[03:01:48.647 --> 03:01:59.994]  So now... Yeah, so now the case is going to be heard in June, and if the lower court, which is a liberal court, decides that they agree with that, those regulations will stand because the upper court will be divided.
[03:01:59.994 --> 03:02:01.175]  Carbon taxes.
[03:02:01.175 --> 03:02:01.615]  Oh my God.
[03:02:01.615 --> 03:02:02.396]  Exactly.
[03:02:02.396 --> 03:02:07.399]  And it had impact, Alex, on the climate treaty that Obama just pushed through at the end of the year.
[03:02:07.719 --> 03:02:09.860]  So there's a lot of issues with it.
[03:02:09.860 --> 03:02:10.641]  That is huge.
[03:02:10.641 --> 03:02:14.584]  That's the same trifecta that Trump is blocking, unlike Scalia was.
[03:02:14.584 --> 03:02:20.588]  One of the three major legs of the globalist strategy to consolidate things economically and politically.
[03:02:20.588 --> 03:02:24.490]  The open borders, the climate treaties, as well as the TPP.
[03:02:24.490 --> 03:02:27.472]  So trifecta, triad, whatever you want to call it.
[03:02:27.472 --> 03:02:33.416]  Trump and Scalia were standing in their way, and no wonder the New York Times is saying, who will take care of this man for me?
[03:02:33.416 --> 03:02:35.217]  That's the voice of the elites, the New York Times.
[03:02:35.217 --> 03:02:35.858]  That's key.
[03:02:35.858 --> 03:02:37.359]  Who will take care of this man for me?
[03:02:38.600 --> 03:02:39.421]  That's key.
[03:02:39.421 --> 03:02:40.703]  And so that's what you're going to see tonight.
[03:02:40.703 --> 03:02:42.384]  Tonight we have the debate.
[03:02:42.384 --> 03:02:45.088]  This is the last gasp of the establishment.
[03:02:45.088 --> 03:02:46.729]  They don't really have anybody.
[03:02:46.729 --> 03:02:47.791]  They're really pretty hopeless.
[03:02:47.791 --> 03:02:49.973]  They put $150 million on Jeb.
[03:02:49.973 --> 03:02:53.437]  They were supposed to scare everybody, have them step down because of the shock and awe.
[03:02:53.437 --> 03:02:56.200]  Look at how much money he's got, even at the very beginning.
[03:02:56.200 --> 03:02:57.262]  They blew through all that.
[03:02:57.782 --> 03:03:02.306]  Absolutely no effect because people are so angry at the GOP establishment now.
[03:03:02.306 --> 03:03:05.088]  They have been lied to time and again.
[03:03:05.088 --> 03:03:11.112]  You've got John Boehner, Mitch McConnell, now Paul Ryan, telling people what they want to hear and doing exactly the opposite.
[03:03:11.112 --> 03:03:20.500]  And you've got the Chinese government, the Pope, the Democrats, the Republicans, the Easter Bunny, the Keebler elves, the Santa Claus, all coming out against Trump.
[03:03:20.500 --> 03:03:24.803]  And it even got you now to start backing Trump, folks, in a vote for him in the Texas primary.
[03:03:24.923 --> 03:03:32.109]  When you look at what's left, you look at people like Marco Rubio, who betrayed everybody with a gang of eight, openly betraying him.
[03:03:32.109 --> 03:03:36.472]  Now he's losing 16 points to Trump in his own state, a sitting senator.
[03:03:36.472 --> 03:03:39.955]  You've got Ted Cruz, who has reversed himself on many key issues.
[03:03:39.955 --> 03:03:41.836]  Many of us look at him and go, well, is he a libertarian?
[03:03:41.836 --> 03:03:42.497]  Is he a Christian?
[03:03:42.497 --> 03:03:42.997]  Whatever.
[03:03:42.997 --> 03:03:44.699]  You see what happened at the Iowa caucus.
[03:03:44.699 --> 03:03:51.644]  You see the fact that he's taken an authoritarian bend, again, like Donald Trump, toward Ed Snowden, saying, you know what?
[03:03:51.644 --> 03:03:52.385]  Yeah, he's a traitor.
[03:03:52.705 --> 03:03:54.846]  He used to say he's a hero, so those issues are off the table.
[03:03:54.846 --> 03:03:57.467]  Trump's got more positives than negatives.
[03:03:57.467 --> 03:03:58.647]  Those issues are off the table.
[03:03:58.647 --> 03:04:02.289]  People say, I believe that he's going to do something about these trade issues.
[03:04:02.289 --> 03:04:07.351]  All right, we're going to come back with a key report on stealth gun confiscation has begun.
[03:04:07.351 --> 03:04:11.232]  Infowars.com, we're posting the video, but we're going to air it right now, coming up after this break.
[03:04:11.232 --> 03:04:18.895]  Then Anthony Giussiardi, from about 17 after to the rest of the hour, so about 43 minutes, he's going to be covering everything else that's broken since then.
[03:04:19.315 --> 03:04:23.582]  I'm giving his analysis and hopefully also he'll have time, if he does, to take some phone calls.
[03:04:23.582 --> 03:04:32.977]  And then tonight, 7 o'clock Central to 10 o'clock, it's going to be David Knight, Jakari Jackson, LeeAnn McAdoo, Darren McVrean, Alex Jones, all of us here.
[03:04:32.977 --> 03:04:33.639]  And don't forget!

[03:05:04.430 --> 03:05:06.192]  What are you guys doing this Thursday?
[03:05:06.192 --> 03:05:07.593]  Probably nothing.
[03:05:07.593 --> 03:05:15.179]  You're gonna get off work, sit down, go through your TV channels, Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, definitely a no.
[03:05:15.179 --> 03:05:18.122]  Watching Dung Beetles on Discovery Channel, negative.

[03:05:40.814 --> 03:05:43.135]  It should be fun for you and all your friends and family.
[03:05:43.135 --> 03:05:43.435]  Haha!
[03:05:43.655 --> 03:05:45.778]  So get some popcorn, sit down and enjoy.

[03:08:21.151 --> 03:08:26.653]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here with a special news alert for the InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:08:26.653 --> 03:08:33.414]  Now as you know tonight, we've already been covering the continued march towards disarmament of the people of the United States.
[03:08:33.414 --> 03:08:34.954]  It's already happened in most parts of the world.
[03:08:34.954 --> 03:08:36.415]  That's why I have this globe here.
[03:08:36.415 --> 03:08:37.575]  I'm going to go over this here in a moment.
[03:08:39.684 --> 03:08:50.655]  But the reason I felt like I needed to take this special presentation tonight is because even I have been conditioned to accept this tyranny incrementally.
[03:08:50.655 --> 03:08:54.659]  America would have never admitted 10 years ago it was being spied on by the NSA.
[03:08:54.659 --> 03:08:56.882]  Now everybody knows you're being spied on illegally.
[03:08:57.796 --> 03:09:00.797]  But we accept it because we were slowly eased into it.
[03:09:00.797 --> 03:09:02.398]  We have to get upset.
[03:09:02.398 --> 03:09:03.719]  We have to get motivated.
[03:09:03.719 --> 03:09:10.802]  We have to be defiant of tyranny and say, we're not turning in our firearms from our cold, dead hands!
[03:09:10.802 --> 03:09:16.545]  From my cold, dead hands!
[03:09:16.545 --> 03:09:21.227]  Quote the late, great Charlton Heston, who was a guest on this program.
[03:09:22.458 --> 03:09:23.738]  In his fight for the Second Amendment.
[03:09:23.738 --> 03:09:25.959]  We have to understand when that right falls, everything else falls.
[03:09:25.959 --> 03:09:28.020]  They're telling you your kids don't belong to you.
[03:09:28.020 --> 03:09:32.281]  They're telling you they're going to come with forced inoculations for you and your family.
[03:09:32.281 --> 03:09:36.242]  They're telling you that they're going to open the borders up outside of law.
[03:09:36.242 --> 03:09:41.283]  That Obama's going to appoint the new Supreme Court Justice outside of congressional confirmation.
[03:09:41.283 --> 03:09:43.104]  Unprecedented things are happening.
[03:09:43.104 --> 03:09:47.065]  This is the season of the tyrant's attempt to keep power.
[03:09:47.765 --> 03:09:51.269]  Because the truth is, humanity's waking up, so they're moving in to take the guns.
[03:09:51.269 --> 03:09:54.632]  Now, I'm going to get to this news here in a moment, but the United Nations...
[03:09:55.805 --> 03:10:02.291]  In 2000, in July 7th, put out their first draft of the Small Arm Disarmament Global Treaty.
[03:10:02.291 --> 03:10:03.692]  And I've covered it many times.
[03:10:03.692 --> 03:10:14.601]  And in the draft summation they said, because civilian ownership of firearms threatens the legitimate power monopoly of the state.
[03:10:14.601 --> 03:10:17.584]  How is a power monopoly of the state a good thing?
[03:10:17.584 --> 03:10:19.085]  There's a name for that.
[03:10:19.085 --> 03:10:20.266]  Oligarchy.
[03:10:20.266 --> 03:10:21.807]  Dictatorship.
[03:10:21.807 --> 03:10:22.248]  Tyranny.
[03:10:23.140 --> 03:10:24.502]  Despotism.
[03:10:24.502 --> 03:10:25.823]  North Korea.
[03:10:25.823 --> 03:10:28.346]  Nazi Germany.
[03:10:28.346 --> 03:10:33.192]  And you look at images of North Korea, that hell, and you notice that only the government has the guns.
[03:10:33.192 --> 03:10:35.796]  It boils down to that.
[03:10:35.796 --> 03:10:39.560]  It's like not even trusting airline pilots to have a gun in the cockpit, which they had before 9-11.
[03:10:39.560 --> 03:10:41.342]  I was taken away from them six months before.
[03:10:42.523 --> 03:10:47.584]  You trust them to fly this giant missile, this giant weapon, but you don't trust them to have a gun.
[03:10:47.584 --> 03:10:53.506]  We only trust special government agents, specially trained, against the Constitution and Bill of Rights to have guns.
[03:10:53.506 --> 03:10:55.507]  That's where this is moving.
[03:10:55.507 --> 03:10:59.568]  Now, behind me is a Daily Caller article.
[03:10:59.568 --> 03:11:01.749]  The gun grabbers are coming.
[03:11:01.749 --> 03:11:06.290]  Lexington, Massachusetts now faces semi-automatic gun confiscation.
[03:11:07.509 --> 03:11:18.237]  And we're going to roll some footage of a few years ago at a reenactment at Lexington, where we shot footage right on the very green where it happened, where the British Redcoats said, turn in your guns, you scum, or we're going to kill you.
[03:11:18.237 --> 03:11:22.781]  And then they aimed and fired first, and that was the shot heard around the world.
[03:11:22.781 --> 03:11:30.687]  In the very city, in the very colony, now a state, where in 1775 they came to confiscate the guns, the people refused.
[03:11:32.281 --> 03:11:34.144]  The town of Lexington.
[03:11:34.144 --> 03:11:40.014]  The people themselves are represented by 200 town meeting members.
[03:11:40.014 --> 03:11:41.958]  People don't vote directly there.
[03:11:41.958 --> 03:11:43.981]  It still goes back to the colonial times.
[03:11:44.887 --> 03:11:54.889]  And they claim to represent their constituents, and they say they have the votes, like Highland Park, Illinois, to ban all semi-automatic firearms.
[03:11:54.889 --> 03:11:58.169]  And they're looking to do it, and then they will come, and they will confiscate them.
[03:11:58.169 --> 03:12:05.251]  That's at Article 34 at their annual town meeting, beginning March 21st, about a month out.
[03:12:05.251 --> 03:12:06.611]  And they think they have the votes to do it.
[03:12:06.611 --> 03:12:12.732]  Now, let's move to something bigger than Lexington, or an area in Illinois, like we just mentioned.
[03:12:13.772 --> 03:12:20.857]  This is from Bloomberg a few years ago, and this is the model they tested in California now being launched by Obama through executive order nationwide.
[03:12:20.857 --> 03:12:25.641]  California seizes guns as owners lose right to keep arms.
[03:12:25.641 --> 03:12:29.384]  And they're claiming it's if your neighbor says they thought you were scary.
[03:12:29.384 --> 03:12:35.368]  Or a family member says he never threatened me or she never threatened me, but I'd like their guns taken.
[03:12:35.368 --> 03:12:39.271]  Or you were PTSD in the Army, no criminal record.
[03:12:39.271 --> 03:12:42.834]  They make the determination outside of law to come take your firearms.
[03:12:44.892 --> 03:12:53.800]  This is what they do, and it's similar to what they've done in areas like New York City, D.C., and Chicago.
[03:12:53.800 --> 03:12:58.504]  Chicago, by the way, has the highest crime rate in the world, and only goes up.
[03:12:58.504 --> 03:13:00.346]  In fact, it's double this year what it was last year.
[03:13:00.346 --> 03:13:02.107]  We can show you those articles.
[03:13:02.107 --> 03:13:08.293]  And so this stealth program is now launched nationwide this year, 2016, with health and human services, no law.
[03:13:08.293 --> 03:13:09.634]  They just said, here's our policy.
[03:13:11.058 --> 03:13:14.823]  You are, as doctors, are going to question people's children about firearms.
[03:13:14.823 --> 03:13:16.965]  You're going to question adults about it.
[03:13:16.965 --> 03:13:20.590]  And if someone has a heart problem, they shouldn't be able to own a gun.
[03:13:20.590 --> 03:13:22.652]  They give them a long list.
[03:13:22.652 --> 03:13:24.435]  If people have kids, they shouldn't be able to have a gun.
[03:13:25.549 --> 03:13:28.390]  And you are to report this to DHS.
[03:13:28.390 --> 03:13:38.293]  And then if a doctor says, all these Politico doctors, all these Commissar doctors, all these doctors trained in the socialist medical schools now, feel like for any reason, you shouldn't have a gun.
[03:13:38.293 --> 03:13:40.313]  No judge, no jury, no nothing.
[03:13:40.313 --> 03:13:42.494]  Your firearms are taken.
[03:13:42.494 --> 03:13:46.415]  The old Soviet Union used the medical system to oppress the people.
[03:13:46.415 --> 03:13:48.516]  So did Nazi Germany.
[03:13:48.516 --> 03:13:51.636]  So what I'm here to announce to you is, out of 170 plus nations around the world,
[03:13:54.582 --> 03:14:01.005]  There's only about 11 that have some type of private gun ownership.
[03:14:01.005 --> 03:14:08.929]  And it's places like Switzerland in Europe that has the lowest crime rate in the world.
[03:14:08.929 --> 03:14:11.331]  And there are limited rights in a few other countries.
[03:14:12.369 --> 03:14:23.600]  Now, of course, if you look at the Islamic invaders that have come into Europe, they go out in the street corners in major cities in Germany and other countries and shoot guns in the air, which are totally illegal.
[03:14:23.600 --> 03:14:27.524]  They have AK-47s to attack people on trains and to attack theaters.
[03:14:27.524 --> 03:14:28.325]  They're brought in.
[03:14:28.325 --> 03:14:29.066]  That's okay.
[03:14:29.066 --> 03:14:31.228]  And if you criticize them, Merkel has you arrested.
[03:14:34.309 --> 03:14:44.234]  They're not worried about real threats, but here in the United States and Canada were some of the few Western countries that still have the right to keep and bear arms.
[03:14:44.234 --> 03:14:49.557]  Of course, in other countries, people are disarmed because they never got out from under colonialism.
[03:14:49.557 --> 03:14:53.119]  It was the Magna Carta in England, starting in...
[03:14:56.955 --> 03:15:06.559]  1215, where the people fought back and got a basic beginning of a system of due process that became the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights.
[03:15:06.559 --> 03:15:10.000]  And they're not just shredding the Second Amendment.
[03:15:10.000 --> 03:15:18.463]  They're taking the First, they're coming after the Fifth, the Ninth, the Tenth, they're coming after the Fourth with all the spying.
[03:15:18.463 --> 03:15:19.964]  Because these protections
[03:15:21.107 --> 03:15:25.209]  That only pointed out God-given rights we already had, stand in the way of tyranny.
[03:15:25.209 --> 03:15:35.573]  And now we have a TPP, Trans-Pacific Partnership, between the Americas and the Pacific nations.
[03:15:35.573 --> 03:15:39.715]  That is a union, and was secretly ratified, but they admit is world government.
[03:15:39.715 --> 03:15:47.698]  And then we have a European Union, and a transatlantic agreement already signed, that is merging our laws and systems with Europe.
[03:15:49.363 --> 03:16:03.044]  The whole world is now merging into a three-part system, a trilateral system, and we have to get in line now with these treaties, like the Small Arms Treaty, and take the American people's guns.
[03:16:03.044 --> 03:16:04.846]  Gun confiscation has already begun.
[03:16:06.186 --> 03:16:08.188]  It's already happened in many cities.
[03:16:08.188 --> 03:16:10.489]  They don't want to sit there and deny it's happening.
[03:16:10.489 --> 03:16:15.073]  We're winning the fight for the hearts and minds when it comes to pro-life and the Second Amendment.
[03:16:15.073 --> 03:16:20.577]  But when it comes to on the ground, the tyrants are just seizing control and moving forward with tyranny.
[03:16:20.577 --> 03:16:22.358]  You are the Paul Revere's of your age.
[03:16:22.358 --> 03:16:25.781]  You are the Paul Revere's in your town and your city.
[03:16:25.781 --> 03:16:27.963]  You are the Paul Revere's in other nations around the world.
[03:16:27.963 --> 03:16:29.164]  It is up to you to realize
[03:16:30.191 --> 03:16:30.832]  We're good to go.
[03:16:52.005 --> 03:16:56.827]  I'm going to throw it back to InfoWars Nightly News and your host this evening.
[03:16:56.827 --> 03:17:02.868]  And then we are going to, of course, tomorrow night be covering the Republican debate ahead of Super Tuesday.
[03:17:02.868 --> 03:17:09.210]  We're also going to have some big Donald Trump news as well coming up at InfoWars.com.
[03:17:09.210 --> 03:17:10.931]  Now back to InfoWars Nightly News.
[03:17:12.759 --> 03:17:14.520]  That's right, that's from Alex Jones.
[03:17:14.520 --> 03:17:15.781]  I'm Anthony Guciardi.
[03:17:15.781 --> 03:17:19.263]  It is the fourth hour of overdrive of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:17:19.263 --> 03:17:26.086]  Alex is going to pop in, actually, here in a little bit and do some live coverage with Facebook Mentions.
[03:17:26.086 --> 03:17:28.768]  And we're also going to cover a bunch of interesting news.
[03:17:28.768 --> 03:17:33.210]  Today is one of those days where the news cycle, it almost feels like you're reading The Onion all day, right?
[03:17:33.210 --> 03:17:35.572]  It feels like it's so over-the-top crazy.
[03:17:36.252 --> 03:17:37.953]  That you can't even believe it?
[03:17:37.953 --> 03:17:40.895]  We're going to talk a little bit about what's coming up in the debate tonight.
[03:17:40.895 --> 03:17:44.717]  There's live coverage on Infowars.com as well at 7pm.
[03:17:44.717 --> 03:17:56.925]  There is the question now, are Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz going to completely try to eviscerate Trump and use everything in his background ever to attack him with the hopes of climbing up the ranks?
[03:17:56.925 --> 03:18:02.188]  Or do they have a solidified position as second and are they going to try and fight
[03:18:02.808 --> 03:18:09.711]  For the second place in hopes that Donald Trump may someday crash and burn if he goes up against Hillary Clinton.
[03:18:09.711 --> 03:18:11.972]  We'll see what goes on with that and I'll give you some insights on that.
[03:18:11.972 --> 03:18:13.653]  We've got some other interesting news.
[03:18:13.653 --> 03:18:17.234]  European Parliament calls for Saudi arms embargo.
[03:18:17.234 --> 03:18:23.336]  And the robots that are coming for jobs that pay $20 an hour or less, the White House finds.
[03:18:23.336 --> 03:18:25.397]  And then another rebuttal to that.
[03:18:25.397 --> 03:18:29.979]  Technology, according to the Guardian, has created more jobs than it has destroyed, says 140 years of data.
[03:18:31.920 --> 03:18:32.741]  So we're going to talk about that.
[03:18:32.741 --> 03:18:35.783]  We've also got a special report on the rise of the robot.
[03:18:35.783 --> 03:18:38.926]  So we'll talk a lot about robots and what's going to actually happen.
[03:18:38.926 --> 03:18:50.336]  And then spying and the NSA is so bad that Italy is asking the US to explain their NSA spying report as Brazil is building a $250 million underwater cable to Europe.
[03:18:53.979 --> 03:19:00.322]  To be supported by Google and Facebook in order to get rid of espionage attempts by the United States.
[03:19:00.322 --> 03:19:01.142]  So that's where we're at.
[03:19:01.142 --> 03:19:08.986]  Other countries are now spending $250 million to build underwater cables so that they can avoid United States espionage.
[03:19:09.466 --> 03:19:12.928]  Also got the declaration of no selfie zones and a lot more.
[03:19:12.928 --> 03:19:16.330]  So we're going to cover that and Alex is coming up live again on the show.
[03:19:16.330 --> 03:19:19.412]  He's going to be on Facebook Mentions on his official Facebook page.
[03:19:19.412 --> 03:19:20.433]  So check that out as well.
[03:19:20.433 --> 03:19:22.774]  We're going to talk about the debate and so much more.
[03:19:22.774 --> 03:19:23.575]  I also want to ask...
[03:19:24.591 --> 03:19:30.435]  If something very, very special that I'm going to talk about is going to happen to Marco Rubio tonight.
[03:19:30.435 --> 03:19:34.998]  If his robotic systems are going to have a meltdown.
[03:19:34.998 --> 03:19:37.059]  So we'll talk about that when we come back as well.
[03:19:37.059 --> 03:19:39.701]  This is the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:19:39.701 --> 03:19:41.062]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:19:41.062 --> 03:19:41.562]  We are live.
[03:19:41.562 --> 03:19:42.943]  We'll be right back in the next segment.
[03:19:52.739 --> 03:19:53.481]  We're good.
[03:20:00.149 --> 03:20:03.872]  I'm just a sweet old lady who needs help crossing the street.
[03:20:03.872 --> 03:20:09.316]  But the real reason I want to get to the other side is so I can steal your identity along the way.
[03:20:09.316 --> 03:20:16.041]  While you're holding onto my hand, the RFID reader in my purse is capturing all your personal information.
[03:20:16.041 --> 03:20:20.284]  Debit cards, credit cards, even your work ID badge isn't safe.
[03:20:20.284 --> 03:20:23.046]  Oh, you have an RFID chipped subway pass?
[03:20:23.046 --> 03:20:24.467]  Well now, so do I!

[03:20:36.611 --> 03:20:39.471]  Even when your wallet is open, imitators don't do that.
[03:20:39.471 --> 03:20:44.353]  ID Stronghold wallets even cost about the same as wallets in most stores, but give you extra protection.

[03:22:28.524 --> 03:22:31.586]  My dad was 59 when he collapsed from a heart attack late last year.
[03:22:31.586 --> 03:22:34.208]  Just this past August was when we spread his ashes on the St.
[03:22:34.208 --> 03:22:34.948]  Croix River.
[03:22:34.948 --> 03:22:37.190]  I loved my dad, but boy was he stubborn.
[03:22:37.190 --> 03:22:40.151]  He hadn't been to the doctor in over 25 years.
[03:22:40.151 --> 03:22:41.032]  His excuse?
[03:22:41.032 --> 03:22:42.373]  He simply couldn't afford it.
[03:22:42.373 --> 03:22:43.974]  He wasn't a rich man by any means.
[03:22:43.974 --> 03:22:49.738]  At less than $107 per month, LibertyOnCall.org would have been the perfect alternative for my father.

[03:23:03.313 --> 03:23:05.814]  What will you do when the power and heat go off?
[03:23:05.814 --> 03:23:07.434]  That could be our future.

[03:24:07.367 --> 03:24:08.028]  Welcome back.
[03:24:08.028 --> 03:24:09.990]  It's the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:09.990 --> 03:24:10.911]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:24:10.911 --> 03:24:13.213]  I'll be with you for the rest of the hour.
[03:24:13.213 --> 03:24:22.021]  And next segment, Alex Jones is going to come in with a live Facebook mentions and we're going to talk about a number of different things, including the debate tonight.
[03:24:22.021 --> 03:24:30.490]  And if you've been following the news, the new narrative is that Rubio and Ted Cruz are going to try and attack Donald Trump.
[03:24:30.990 --> 03:24:34.573]  Politico says Cruz, Rubio prep for brutal debate night.
[03:24:34.573 --> 03:24:41.177]  In final show before Super Tuesday, the Senators are poised to unleash a nasty assault and immerse the anti-Trump.
[03:24:41.177 --> 03:24:44.219]  For Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz, this might be their last best chance.
[03:24:44.219 --> 03:24:58.730]  The final Republican debate Thursday night before the Super Tuesday contest has the potential to be an epic display of anger and rhetorical aggression with Rubio and Cruz going after each one on everything from policy to character as each struggles to emerge as the single alternative to Donald Trump.
[03:24:59.588 --> 03:25:14.816]  Well, I would ask is if they're actually going to attack him, because then that would allow him to respond, and they theoretically would want to give him as least camera time as possible, but they could also go for the angle of bringing up everything in his past and trying to attack him to try and break him down.
[03:25:14.816 --> 03:25:18.819]  But that seems to have not worked very well for them in the past.
[03:25:18.819 --> 03:25:19.559]  Some thoughts on that?
[03:25:19.559 --> 03:25:23.201]  It'll definitely be an interesting, probably the most quote-unquote brutal debate.
[03:25:23.201 --> 03:25:26.303]  And one of the key topics, I'm sure, of the entire debate, and really
[03:25:27.023 --> 03:25:33.787]  of the decade is going to be the so-called robot takeover, right?
[03:25:33.787 --> 03:25:38.150]  Which I think, overall, there's a medium to all of this.
[03:25:38.150 --> 03:25:44.674]  A new report says, the robots are coming for jobs that pay $20 an hour or less, White House finds.
[03:25:44.674 --> 03:25:46.255]  This is from Market Watch.
[03:25:46.255 --> 03:25:54.101]  It's intuitive that automation will take low-wage jobs, but the White House, in its annual economic report of the President, has broken down just how much that is so.
[03:25:55.128 --> 03:26:06.612]  According to the report, there's an 83% chance that automation will take a job with an hourly wage below $20, a 31% chance automation will take a job with an hourly wage between $20 and $40, and a 4% chance automation will take a job with an hourly wage above $40.
[03:26:13.692 --> 03:26:19.840]  We're playing in the background the Boston Dynamics AI robot which played for you before.
[03:26:19.840 --> 03:26:31.176]  I saw it the other night actually when it first came out on Reddit and I watched it and I'll tell you what's interesting about this footage as well as that previous Boston Dynamics footage which is the AI robots that walk around.
[03:26:31.516 --> 03:26:33.798]  Now before, it was kind of like a dog.
[03:26:33.798 --> 03:26:38.842]  If you remember, it was like a robotic dog and it would walk around and they would kick it.
[03:26:38.842 --> 03:26:40.403]  And you felt bad for it.
[03:26:40.403 --> 03:26:41.264]  That's the craziest part.
[03:26:41.264 --> 03:26:42.765]  You would feel bad for the dog.
[03:26:42.765 --> 03:26:46.448]  And in this case, it shows a robot picking up boxes and stuff.
[03:26:46.448 --> 03:26:53.313]  And then there's one point where the guy has this like stick and he pushes the robot down on the ground and you feel bad.
[03:26:53.313 --> 03:26:56.556]  You're like, wow, your internal responses are telling you
[03:26:57.276 --> 03:27:02.017]  That it looks like a human, so therefore you have sympathy for it, which is pretty wild to think about.
[03:27:02.017 --> 03:27:10.039]  It's also showing how he's pushing the box away and the robot's trying to pick it up, and he's keep pushing it away with a hockey stick, and you feel bad for the robot.
[03:27:10.039 --> 03:27:24.243]  It's because we're so programmed in our brain to see something that looks like a human and feel bad for it, and that has some very interesting implications that our brains may not even be able to keep up to the point, once it gets to a real life looking, you know, human looking robot.
[03:27:25.103 --> 03:27:26.564]  Could be very interesting.
[03:27:26.564 --> 03:27:38.309]  Now, conversely, we talked about how robots are going to take $20 an hour less jobs, or 30% chance they're going to take up to $40 an hour, and some people think, well, gee, it's going to destroy the entire economy.
[03:27:39.554 --> 03:27:46.381]  Might be the case, but the Guardian says that technology has created more jobs than it has destroyed according to 140 years of data.
[03:27:46.381 --> 03:27:47.883]  And you have to think about this.
[03:27:47.883 --> 03:27:58.634]  So it says a study by economists at the consultancy Deloitte seek to shed new light on the relationship between jobs and the rise of technology by trawling through census data for England and Wales going back to 1871.
[03:28:00.984 --> 03:28:03.626]  Their conclusion is unremittingly cheerful.
[03:28:03.626 --> 03:28:08.610]  Rather than destroying jobs, technology has been a, quote, great job-creating machine.
[03:28:08.610 --> 03:28:20.320]  They say there's a four-fold rise in bar staff since the 1950s, where a surge in the number of hairdressers this century suggests to the authors that technology is increasing spending power, creating new demand and new jobs.
[03:28:21.201 --> 03:28:30.446]  Machines will take on a more repetitive and laborious task, but seem no closer to eliminating the need for human labor than any time in the last 150 years.
[03:28:30.446 --> 03:28:31.427]  And it goes on.
[03:28:31.427 --> 03:28:32.988]  This is an important study to consider.
[03:28:32.988 --> 03:28:40.192]  It says, technology has quite clearly cut job costs, but Stewart and his colleagues question whether they're really jobs we would want to hold on to.
[03:28:40.192 --> 03:28:45.675]  Technology directly substitutes human muscle power in doing so, raises productivity and shrinks employment.
[03:28:45.675 --> 03:28:48.336]  It goes on to talk about how in 1901 there were 32.5
[03:28:51.358 --> 03:28:51.819]  We're good.
[03:29:10.154 --> 03:29:10.815]  We're good.
[03:29:25.992 --> 03:29:30.014]  Major universities have signed off on a document warning about artificial intelligence.
[03:29:30.014 --> 03:29:35.677]  There's so many aspects to it, but I think it's one of the most important subjects and it's definitely going to be brought up in the debate tonight.
[03:29:35.677 --> 03:29:36.377]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:36.377 --> 03:29:40.419]  Alex is supposed to come in live on Facebook Mentions and be a part of the show.
[03:29:40.419 --> 03:29:41.780]  We'll talk more about the debate and more.
[03:29:41.780 --> 03:29:42.820]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:29:42.820 --> 03:29:48.083]  Stay tuned.
[03:29:48.083 --> 03:29:49.483]  We're on the march.
[03:29:49.483 --> 03:29:52.025]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:52.025 --> 03:29:54.686]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.632 --> 03:30:04.016]  Marco Rubio, Wall Street's boy toy.
[03:30:04.016 --> 03:30:10.084]  He's gotten more money from the elite donors in Wall Street than number two Jeb or even number three Hillary.
[03:30:10.084 --> 03:30:13.309]  After blowing 150 million dollars on Jeb, they still haven't learned anything.
[03:30:15.043 --> 03:30:17.425]  Jeb's dropping out didn't help Rubio in Nevada.
[03:30:17.425 --> 03:30:20.729]  Rubio is the establishment's 20% solution.
[03:30:20.729 --> 03:30:25.273]  Jeb had a sense of entitlement, kind of like the donor class and the party elite that support Rubio.
[03:30:25.273 --> 03:30:29.718]  They believe they can openly oppose the voters on their key issues and still win.
[03:30:29.718 --> 03:30:31.600]  But Rubio is a little smarter.
[03:30:31.600 --> 03:30:36.825]  He realizes that his support for illegal immigration with a gang of eight was a betrayal of the voters.
[03:30:37.085 --> 03:30:39.488]  But he still thinks they're too stupid to see through the lies.
[03:30:39.488 --> 03:30:47.676]  He's called Breitbart a conspiracy website and the president of the Ice Union a liar when they exposed Rubio's betrayal with the Gang of Eight.
[03:30:47.676 --> 03:30:55.404]  But Rubio's campaign will provide a useful public service, identifying the GOP political class who will say anything to get elected.
[03:30:55.404 --> 03:30:57.206]  For InfoWars.com, I'm David Knight.
[03:30:58.504 --> 03:31:02.025]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[03:31:02.025 --> 03:31:10.266]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[03:31:10.266 --> 03:31:15.668]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[03:31:15.668 --> 03:31:18.208]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[03:31:59.545 --> 03:32:03.308]  Thousands of years ago, there was a basic form of chivalry.
[03:32:03.308 --> 03:32:11.053]  Our ancestors would hear the drums of war, giving the warriors of the tribe a chance to organize and prepare a defense.
[03:32:11.053 --> 03:32:19.658]  Sixty years ago, when foreign air forces were approaching filled with bombs, they had drums of their own, air raid sirens.
[03:32:19.658 --> 03:32:24.101]  But in the 21st century, there are silent weapons for quiet war.
[03:32:24.101 --> 03:32:29.445]  Pathogens added to the food and water, to the lining of plastics that destroy our vitality.
[03:32:29.665 --> 03:32:33.906]  Turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[03:32:33.906 --> 03:32:37.327]  I personally counter this onslaught with AnthroPlex.
[03:32:37.327 --> 03:32:48.450]  AnthroPlex is designed with known, organic, concentrated herbs to create the basic foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.
[03:32:48.450 --> 03:32:51.371]  Discover why AnthroPlex is turning so many heads today.
[03:32:51.371 --> 03:32:57.333]  It's time for us to take our bodies back into our own hands and it starts at InfoWarsLife.com with AnthroPlex.
[03:33:08.926 --> 03:33:11.507]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:33:11.507 --> 03:33:18.151]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:33:18.151 --> 03:33:19.872]  The Motley Crue.
[03:33:19.872 --> 03:33:20.992]  It is the fourth hour.
[03:33:20.992 --> 03:33:22.193]  It is Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:33:22.193 --> 03:33:23.954]  I'm going to be with you for the rest of the hour.
[03:33:23.954 --> 03:33:26.635]  And Alex is about to join us in this segment.
[03:33:26.635 --> 03:33:28.756]  He's live right now on Facebook Mentions.
[03:33:28.756 --> 03:33:31.418]  And we're going to talk about the debate and so much more.
[03:33:31.418 --> 03:33:37.181]  You know, with all the crazy news, I mean, truly insane news, right, coming out today, it's like an Onion Story, as I said earlier.
[03:33:37.961 --> 03:33:40.322]  I have but one question.
[03:33:40.322 --> 03:33:48.584]  Tonight at the debates, will Marco Rubio have a Milli Vanilli moment, and will his CD track skip when he goes to speak?
[03:33:48.584 --> 03:33:53.945]  In the back, he's kind of like an artificial intelligence robot, and he has a speaking moment.
[03:33:53.945 --> 03:33:55.825]  He says the same thing eight times in a row.
[03:33:55.825 --> 03:34:05.748]  I wonder if his CD track will skip, so he kind of says, Obama is, Obama is, Obama is, and he kind of self-destruction blows up, and his robotic bolts and screws go everywhere.
[03:34:05.748 --> 03:34:06.648]  I wonder if that's going to happen.
[03:34:07.248 --> 03:34:13.837]  Now, also, we're not going to be able to take your calls because there's not enough time and Alex is about to come in, but I will be answering questions on Twitter.
[03:34:13.837 --> 03:34:19.324]  So if you tweet me at ASGucciardi, I will be answering your questions live on air.
[03:34:19.324 --> 03:34:20.805]  So we'll try and get to those.
[03:34:20.805 --> 03:34:22.708]  Now, also, there's been so much news lately.
[03:34:23.809 --> 03:34:30.572]  That we really haven't even touched on so many different things, and that includes what's going on in New York.
[03:34:30.572 --> 03:34:32.233]  And John Bowne has an interesting report.
[03:34:32.233 --> 03:34:35.035]  I haven't seen it yet, and I want to play it for you first here.
[03:34:35.035 --> 03:34:37.316]  Actually, it's unpremiered as far as I'm aware.
[03:34:37.316 --> 03:34:39.137]  It's called Chernobyl on the Hudson.
[03:34:39.137 --> 03:34:44.219]  And we haven't given this enough attention because of all the craziness going on every single day in the news, right?
[03:34:44.219 --> 03:34:45.100]  There's so much to cover.
[03:34:45.760 --> 03:34:55.428]  But we have not even given enough attention to the massive tumor on the side of the United States, which is the leaking power plants across the country.
[03:34:55.428 --> 03:34:58.631]  Let's check out Chernobyl on the Hudson by John Bell.
[03:34:59.548 --> 03:35:02.310]  It has been nicknamed Chernobyl on the Hudson.
[03:35:02.310 --> 03:35:13.098]  Lying just 34 miles north of New York City's Central Park, the Indian Point Energy Center has been leaking the radioactive material known as tritium into the groundwater.
[03:35:13.098 --> 03:35:21.284]  On February 6, 2016, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo finally alerted the public as to the potential catastrophe.
[03:35:21.684 --> 03:35:23.445]  Better late than never?
[03:35:23.445 --> 03:35:32.511]  In 1973, the plant was shut down after engineers discovered buckling in the steel liner of the concrete dome in which the nuclear reactor is housed.
[03:35:32.511 --> 03:35:50.503]  On October 17, 1980, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission proposed a $2,100,000 fine for an incident involving 100,000 gallons of Hudson River water that had leaked into the Indian Point 2 containment building from the fan cooling unit, undetected by a safety device designed to detect hot water.
[03:35:50.523 --> 03:35:51.044]  I think so.
[03:36:06.840 --> 03:36:14.369]  These mutated Tom Cods had evolved after GE dumped PCBs into the Hudson River from 1947 to 1976.
[03:36:14.369 --> 03:36:21.617]  In 2005, Entergy workers, while digging, discovered a small leak in a spent fuel pool.
[03:36:21.817 --> 03:36:29.965]  Water containing tritium and strontium-90 was leaking through a crack in the pool building and then finding its way into the nearby Hudson River.
[03:36:29.965 --> 03:36:37.293]  In 2007, a transformer at Unit 3 caught fire and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission raised its level of inspections.
[03:36:37.293 --> 03:36:43.279]  In April of 2007, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission fined the owner of the Indian Point Nuclear Plant
[03:36:43.839 --> 03:36:48.802]  $130,000 for failing to meet a deadline for a new emergency siren plant.
[03:36:48.802 --> 03:36:55.347]  The 150 sirens at the plant were meant to alert residents within 10 miles to a plant emergency.
[03:36:55.347 --> 03:37:06.734]  In 2009, an International Journal of Health Services study revealed that residents living on the Hudson had a 67% higher thyroid cancer rate than the national average.
[03:37:07.154 --> 03:37:13.860]  In 2010, an explosion occurred in a main transformer for Indian Point II, spilling oil into the Hudson River.
[03:37:13.860 --> 03:37:19.605]  Entergy later agreed to pay a $1.2 million penalty for the transformer explosion.
[03:37:19.605 --> 03:37:30.835]  In July of 2013, a former supervisor who worked at Indian Point Nuclear Power Plant for 29 years was arrested for falsifying critical safety records and lying to federal regulators.
[03:37:31.295 --> 03:37:40.660]  In June of 2015, a mylar balloon floated into a switch yard, causing an electrical problem resulting in the shutdown of Reactor 3.
[03:37:40.660 --> 03:37:46.283]  In July of 2015, Reactor 3 was again shut down after a water pump failure.
[03:37:46.283 --> 03:37:53.207]  On December 5, 2015, Indian Point 2 was shut down after several control rods lost power.
[03:37:53.767 --> 03:38:08.519]  Obviously, Indian Point could potentially be a repeat of the, at the very least, Level 7 Fukushima Daiichi disaster if a nuclear meltdown occurs due to a hurricane or other natural event leading to equipment failures.
[03:38:08.519 --> 03:38:18.047]  However, a similar disaster would require the evacuation of 5.6 million people and render Manhattan a no-go zone for decades.
[03:38:18.687 --> 03:38:37.800]  In 2004, a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists estimated as many as 44,000 near-term deaths from acute radiation syndrome and as many as 518,000 long-term cancer deaths could occur in people within 50 miles of Indian Point in the event of a severe accident.
[03:38:37.800 --> 03:38:46.686]  Potential disaster models reveal the Indian Point plume could reach Chernobyl mass event levels nine times the radiation released at Fukushima.
[03:38:47.226 --> 03:38:52.928]  Indian Point is just one of at least five damaged nuclear power plants in the United States.
[03:38:52.928 --> 03:38:55.689]  They are an obvious target for terrorists.
[03:38:55.689 --> 03:39:03.971]  Just one more glaring reason why we need our borders closed to President Obama's unconstitutional executive order on immigration.
[03:39:03.971 --> 03:39:05.852]  John Bowne for InfoWars.com
[03:39:11.459 --> 03:39:13.841]  Alright we're back and Alex is here in studio.
[03:39:13.841 --> 03:39:20.266]  He's live on Facebook Mentions and he's got a microphone as well and we've got a special piece of art actually that we wanted to show.
[03:39:20.266 --> 03:39:24.229]  This is live from the Bohemian Grove actually.
[03:39:24.229 --> 03:39:25.510]  We have this hung up in the office.
[03:39:25.510 --> 03:39:28.693]  We're covering Bohemian Grove which is a branch of the Illuminati.
[03:39:29.033 --> 03:39:30.574]  Well, they're just roasting marshmallows.
[03:39:30.574 --> 03:39:32.194]  It's completely normal.
[03:39:32.194 --> 03:39:32.614]  Natural.
[03:39:32.614 --> 03:39:34.555]  Let's talk about Bohemian Grove for a minute.
[03:39:34.555 --> 03:39:35.415]  Probably making masks of devils.
[03:39:35.415 --> 03:39:35.595]  It's fine.
[03:39:51.468 --> 03:39:53.651]  So what's interesting is I've talked to people, right?
[03:39:53.651 --> 03:39:57.355]  And I saw your film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove, years ago.
[03:39:57.355 --> 03:40:00.258]  And everyone always would say, you know, that sounds insane.
[03:40:00.258 --> 03:40:05.384]  If they actually sit down and watch the film, they'll realize what's insane is the actual ceremony itself.
[03:40:05.384 --> 03:40:05.604]  Right?
[03:40:05.604 --> 03:40:06.566]  You don't even have to say anything.
[03:40:06.566 --> 03:40:07.246]  You don't have to say anything.
[03:40:07.246 --> 03:40:09.429]  You just say, watch this.
[03:40:09.429 --> 03:40:10.931]  And they take it so seriously.
[03:40:12.279 --> 03:40:15.141]  It is like a play, but they're taking it so seriously.
[03:40:15.141 --> 03:40:23.849]  And then you go in there and now actually talking to you, right, and hearing the rest of the full story about what was going on and what they think you were doing in there and who they thought you were and all the craziness.
[03:40:23.849 --> 03:40:24.830]  It's like mind-blowing.
[03:40:24.830 --> 03:40:27.032]  But if you actually watch the film, which you should, it's on YouTube.
[03:40:27.552 --> 03:40:29.054]  If you have people watch the film too.
[03:40:29.054 --> 03:40:29.835]  You don't have to say anything.
[03:40:29.835 --> 03:40:31.156]  It's the footage speaks for itself.
[03:40:31.156 --> 03:40:32.578]  Just watch the best of or something.
[03:40:32.578 --> 03:40:34.520]  They're like singing in these weird rituals.
[03:40:34.520 --> 03:40:38.184]  And by the way, let me just do an infomercial here because that's how we fund our operation.
[03:40:38.184 --> 03:40:44.490]  You can get Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove and The Order of Death, two films, on the subject of the occult and the Illuminati that I made and infiltrate these groups.
[03:40:44.490 --> 03:40:45.652]  This was world news when I did it.
[03:40:46.212 --> 03:40:47.472]  On DVD at InfowarsStore.com.
[03:40:47.472 --> 03:40:49.693]  You can watch it for free on YouTube and Google.
[03:40:49.693 --> 03:40:54.815]  We put it up for everybody for free, but if you want to have it in your archives, have it on the shelf, this is one film everybody should have.
[03:40:54.815 --> 03:40:55.655]  InfowarsStore.com.
[03:40:55.655 --> 03:41:00.137]  But, Leanne, I love the fact that you and Biggs both texted me at like one in the morning when this broke last night.
[03:41:00.137 --> 03:41:00.957]  It was all over the news today.
[03:41:01.357 --> 03:41:03.759]  Secret Society, no big deal, you know.
[03:41:03.759 --> 03:41:06.362]  Connection Disorders, Illuminati, it's no big deal.
[03:41:06.362 --> 03:41:09.244]  Unitized Illuminati Command Base, no big deal.
[03:41:09.244 --> 03:41:13.668]  I think that you are so excited about this because it really does illustrate how crazy all of this is.
[03:41:13.668 --> 03:41:23.096]  So I'm going to turn this over to you and Anthony for about the next five minutes on Facebook Mentions and then tell us tonight about the coverage coming up 7 o'clock Central with yourself.
[03:41:23.897 --> 03:41:26.778]  Well, I'm totally dominating you right now, Anthony, standing up here.
[03:41:26.778 --> 03:41:27.358]  I wish I had a chair.
[03:41:27.358 --> 03:41:31.378]  Well, we're going to get you a chair if you can sit right here on the table.
[03:41:50.563 --> 03:41:51.364]  It's impromptu.
[03:41:51.364 --> 03:41:51.704]  Yes.
[03:41:51.704 --> 03:41:53.765]  We're bringing you a charity.
[03:41:53.765 --> 03:42:06.032]  Well, I, personally, I was so excited about this story, that's why I had to, thank you, that's why I had to text you late last night, just like, oh my gosh, I know it's late, but you've got to read this before the show tomorrow, because to me it's really exciting.
[03:42:06.032 --> 03:42:11.676]  I mean, we report about this stuff so much that it kind of gets mundane, and it's sort of like, oh, whatever.
[03:42:11.676 --> 03:42:13.057]  Secrets of Society, aww.
[03:42:15.558 --> 03:42:34.409]  But then this is like, fresh, this is fresh, and like one of the most important Supreme Court justices dies during one of these secret meetings while our guys are down there being harassed by Poindexter, who's like, ugh, you're the kind of people I hate having at the ranch.
[03:42:34.409 --> 03:42:40.292]  You know, I love you sophisticated friends that I've invited, not like these folks over here.
[03:42:40.292 --> 03:42:41.413]  I mean, it just...
[03:42:42.333 --> 03:42:46.714]  It just has all the trappings of a really great movie, so I'm excited.
[03:42:46.714 --> 03:42:48.135]  Definitely sounds like a good movie.
[03:42:48.135 --> 03:42:48.875]  Who knows what happened.
[03:42:48.875 --> 03:42:50.795]  How absurd, though.
[03:42:50.795 --> 03:42:52.276]  Such weirdness.
[03:42:52.276 --> 03:42:54.616]  It's almost like you couldn't invent all the weirdness, right?
[03:42:54.616 --> 03:43:03.539]  It's almost like if you were writing, like you said, a movie script, it's like, oh, there was some weird secret thing going on and there's skull photos, like devil photos.
[03:43:03.539 --> 03:43:06.380]  It just, it sounds, it sounds made up.
[03:43:06.380 --> 03:43:08.860]  That's the issue with even talking about it, too, though.
[03:43:08.860 --> 03:43:11.541]  Because it sounds so far-fetched, but then you look at the mainstream sources.
[03:43:11.940 --> 03:43:17.764]  Yeah, I mean, someone working on a movie script right now is just like, yes, thank you, because this is golden.
[03:43:17.764 --> 03:43:20.346]  I mean, it's on a cinematic range.
[03:43:20.346 --> 03:43:21.546]  Yeah.
[03:43:21.546 --> 03:43:24.308]  Because the real world's crazier than you made up crap.
[03:43:24.308 --> 03:43:25.049]  Right.
[03:43:25.049 --> 03:43:26.029]  The real world is crazier.
[03:43:26.029 --> 03:43:27.010]  It's so wild.
[03:43:27.010 --> 03:43:28.631]  And that it's so wild.
[03:43:28.631 --> 03:43:30.472]  All the conspiracy theories that were out there.
[03:43:30.472 --> 03:43:35.396]  I mean, there were so many articles about, oh, look at the conspiracy theories surrounding Scalia's death.
[03:43:35.396 --> 03:43:41.740]  And then it turns out it was even more bizarre than any other conspiracy theories that were being thrown around.
[03:43:42.020 --> 03:43:51.066]  Well, I think everyone has gotten to the point, if you just look at five years ago, if you were to look at five years from now, or previously, look up to now, look at the debates tonight, for example.
[03:43:51.066 --> 03:43:58.071]  Every story is like, yes, Cruz and Rubio are just going to viciously assault Trump and bring up everything in his past and try and destroy him and make up things about him.
[03:43:58.071 --> 03:43:58.951]  It's crazy.
[03:43:58.951 --> 03:44:03.294]  And then this is like, there's a secret society with demon paintings everywhere and Scalia died.
[03:44:03.294 --> 03:44:04.375]  He might have been on Viagra.
[03:44:04.975 --> 03:44:18.785]  It's like, what is happening is totally lost control in so many different ways, and then the mainstream media tries to take the narrative and always spin it with a direction against whatever they're opposing, and it gets so absurd that people don't even buy any of it anymore.
[03:44:18.785 --> 03:44:20.927]  The system is committing suicide.
[03:44:20.927 --> 03:44:25.370]  The system is murdering its own credibility through their narcissistic arrogance.
[03:44:25.370 --> 03:44:27.331]  You should come speak on the microphone.
[03:44:27.331 --> 03:44:29.453]  Because we already have a wrecked population.
[03:44:30.438 --> 03:44:37.385]  Well, I think what comes after it is that the faith in the mainstream media is already gone and that people don't believe it anymore, even if it's true.
[03:44:37.385 --> 03:44:40.328]  They don't believe it just because their logo is on there.
[03:44:40.328 --> 03:44:40.789]  Right.
[03:44:40.789 --> 03:44:50.318]  And that's what's so interesting is that you have these secret societies that for hundreds of years have been able to maintain their secrets, maintain the secrecy of who's involved and what they do.
[03:44:51.880 --> 03:44:53.321]  The world is changing.
[03:44:53.321 --> 03:44:54.881]  It's not a secret anymore.
[03:44:54.881 --> 03:45:00.524]  You see the planes flying in, so it's just really interesting to see that secrets are no more.
[03:45:00.524 --> 03:45:02.585]  And we're changing the world by doing different stuff.
[03:45:02.585 --> 03:45:03.905]  So can the viewers.
[03:45:03.905 --> 03:45:11.269]  Just like we started a few years ago, four years ago or whatever, covering live debates and covering stuff in commentary on media, now everybody's doing it.
[03:45:11.269 --> 03:45:13.350]  And it's just an example of thinking outside the box, folks.
[03:45:13.350 --> 03:45:14.950]  I'm going to turn it back over to you guys.
[03:45:14.950 --> 03:45:19.772]  I don't normally wear purple-red pants, but I was given these for Christmas, so I'm sporting them.
[03:45:21.172 --> 03:45:22.474]  No, take the microphone.
[03:45:22.474 --> 03:45:23.175]  Today's the day.
[03:45:23.175 --> 03:45:24.157]  No, no, no, no.
[03:45:24.157 --> 03:45:24.658]  I'm getting down here.
[03:45:24.658 --> 03:45:26.260]  I want you guys to talk and hang out.
[03:45:26.260 --> 03:45:27.462]  It's fun to walk around over there.
[03:45:27.462 --> 03:45:31.569]  I actually gotta go have a meeting about awesome apps we're getting built for InfoWars.
[03:45:31.569 --> 03:45:33.332]  What?
[03:45:33.332 --> 03:45:35.435]  The Darth Vader Death Star app.
[03:45:36.357 --> 03:45:42.201]  I know so many people have requested your voice for their ringtone, so you might want to work on that.
[03:45:42.201 --> 03:45:47.384]  Anytime you get a new article out, a little buzz alarm with your... You'll wake up real quick with him screaming.
[03:45:58.251 --> 03:45:59.251]  Sounds interesting.
[03:45:59.251 --> 03:45:59.951]  It's ridiculous.
[03:45:59.951 --> 03:46:00.272]  No, no.
[03:46:00.272 --> 03:46:02.712]  I mean, I was going to shoot this video on helium balloons, my daughter's birthday.
[03:46:02.712 --> 03:46:06.753]  I did one where I was like, oh, Justice Kalia died of natural causes just like Kennedy.
[03:46:06.753 --> 03:46:07.474]  Natural causes.
[03:46:07.474 --> 03:46:09.994]  Let me see if I can actually find it.
[03:46:09.994 --> 03:46:14.115]  Well, now it's proven he did obviously die just of natural causes.
[03:46:14.115 --> 03:46:15.456]  There was nothing funky about it.
[03:46:15.456 --> 03:46:16.356]  It was totally normal.
[03:46:17.814 --> 03:46:24.879]  Obviously he died, he said obviously he died peacefully in his sleep because his bed clothing was unwrinkled.
[03:46:24.879 --> 03:46:26.640]  And he had a full tummy!
[03:46:26.640 --> 03:46:30.062]  And it's full tummy.
[03:46:30.062 --> 03:46:33.364]  Well that's, I don't think... We ought to do a whole joke piece.
[03:46:33.364 --> 03:46:33.944]  Yes!
[03:46:33.944 --> 03:46:37.327]  We ought to do a whole joke piece where we read all his quotes and how it's all scripted.
[03:46:37.327 --> 03:46:39.068]  It's like a children's story.
[03:46:39.068 --> 03:46:42.430]  There were little beds outside the room and the Pope dropped by.
[03:46:47.936 --> 03:47:00.072]  Meanwhile, Brazil is spending $250 million on an underwater cable to Europe that's supported by Google and Facebook to avoid espionage attempts by the United States.
[03:47:00.072 --> 03:47:01.233]  So think about that for a minute.
[03:47:01.934 --> 03:47:03.915]  They're spending 250 million dollars.
[03:47:03.915 --> 03:47:15.403]  It says, this is from International Business Times, Brazil is constructing a dedicated underwater cable to link the southern American country's internet directly with Europe and avoid any espionage attempts by the United States.
[03:47:15.403 --> 03:47:17.165]  Not ISIS, right?
[03:47:17.165 --> 03:47:20.987]  Not Al-Qaeda, not China, the United States.
[03:47:20.987 --> 03:47:29.173]  The structure, which is estimated to cost up to 250 million dollars, will come into operation by late 2017 and is likely to be supported by tech giants Google and Facebook.
[03:47:30.814 --> 03:47:36.556]  The United States' own top corporations, Google and Facebook, are supporting the move to block U.S.
[03:47:36.556 --> 03:47:37.256]  espionage.
[03:47:37.256 --> 03:47:46.479]  Just like Apple, according to their PR, is stopping the United States government from cracking into all their phones, because once they set the precedent, they can look at everybody's stuff.
[03:47:46.479 --> 03:47:54.841]  Brazil's communications minister, Andrei Figueiredo, I don't know how exactly to say that, said that nearly a dozen multinational tech giants have shown interest in becoming part of the venture.
[03:47:54.841 --> 03:47:59.863]  So, a bunch of different tech giants in the United States also want to be a part of it to get rid of the U.S.
[03:47:59.863 --> 03:48:00.223]  spying.
[03:48:00.583 --> 03:48:04.547]  Right, well they see how ubiquitous this Panopticon is going to be.
[03:48:04.547 --> 03:48:09.072]  And then they come out and say, well we need this backdoor to stop the bad guys from spying.
[03:48:09.072 --> 03:48:16.220]  Meanwhile, in the same sentence, James Clapper comes out and says, we're going to be using the internet of things to spy on you, to recruit.
[03:48:16.220 --> 03:48:18.702]  I mean, so they're the bad guys.
[03:48:18.702 --> 03:48:19.023]  Sometimes.
[03:48:19.912 --> 03:48:30.847]  Well, it just shows how out of control everything has gotten, to the point where the news now says that other countries and our own tech giants are building underwater cables to get rid of the United States spying on them.
[03:48:30.847 --> 03:48:31.148]  Right.
[03:48:31.148 --> 03:48:33.791]  Back a few years ago, they would at least deny that was happening.
[03:48:33.791 --> 03:48:34.112]  Right.
[03:48:34.112 --> 03:48:35.274]  Now it's so open.
[03:48:35.274 --> 03:48:36.836]  It's not making us safer, that's for sure.
[03:48:37.116 --> 03:48:38.197]  Then you have stuff like this.
[03:48:38.197 --> 03:48:39.319]  This is from Alternet.
[03:48:39.319 --> 03:48:44.625]  Big Pharma identified 7,000 government officials they need to control to run their price gouging operation.
[03:48:44.625 --> 03:48:51.834]  This reminds me of Martin Shkreli raising the price of the drug that AIDS patients were taking by X thousand percentage from like $40 to $12,000 or whatever it was.
[03:48:53.536 --> 03:49:03.680]  And it says, hoping to counter the demand for action, drug companies have launched their massive advertising campaign, not only running radio and print ads, but placing ads on Facebook, Twitter and other social media websites.
[03:49:03.680 --> 03:49:06.021]  Yet it's not likely that you've seen or heard any of them.
[03:49:06.021 --> 03:49:08.922]  That's because drug chieftains don't care what you and I think.
[03:49:08.922 --> 03:49:12.444]  Moreover, they know they couldn't possibly persuade us to let them keep jacking their prices.
[03:49:12.444 --> 03:49:14.965]  Yeah, from $14 to $700.
[03:49:14.965 --> 03:49:20.947]  So their public relations effort has made the odd and seemingly counterproductive move of sidestepping the actual public, narrowing
[03:49:21.187 --> 03:49:23.108]  Narrowly targeting a very tiny audience.
[03:49:23.108 --> 03:49:25.169]  Guess who it is?
[03:49:25.169 --> 03:49:27.151]  7,000 government officials that make all the decisions.
[03:49:27.151 --> 03:49:27.391]  Wow.
[03:49:27.391 --> 03:49:37.177]  So they're spending marketing ads, CPC ads and stuff on Google, Facebook, Twitter, whatever, not to hit the public, to change their mind on the price gouging, but the government officials that vote on it.
[03:49:37.797 --> 03:49:47.260]  One CEO arrogantly put it, quote, we've identified 7,000 Americans who matter, thus dismissing the other 330 million of us as nobodies.
[03:49:47.260 --> 03:49:52.161]  Quote, we're focusing on those in policy positions to fight structural issues.
[03:49:52.161 --> 03:50:01.844]  By structural issues, he means convincing Congress to take no action to reform the present pricing structure of the monopolistic drug makers whose guiding corporate ethic is freedom for all they've got.
[03:50:01.844 --> 03:50:02.024]  Wow.
[03:50:03.064 --> 03:50:09.427]  It's no longer an effort to convince the public that something matters or convince you and I that maybe, you know, they have justification in doing that.
[03:50:09.427 --> 03:50:11.988]  Now the drug companies don't even care about their PR.
[03:50:11.988 --> 03:50:13.969]  Just like the United States government doesn't care about the PR.
[03:50:13.969 --> 03:50:15.910]  Just like the mainstream media doesn't care about the PR.
[03:50:15.910 --> 03:50:18.931]  They're sidestepping completely and going straight for the jugular.
[03:50:18.931 --> 03:50:23.193]  Going to the 7,000 officials that, quote, matter instead of the people.
[03:50:23.453 --> 03:50:26.614]  So it doesn't even, they're not even pretending that we have power anymore.
[03:50:26.614 --> 03:50:45.681]  They're just literally serving up a big fat turkey to the oligarchs, that you could call it, or the decision makers that run everything, the establishment bobblehead people, and saying, please take our offering and we will advertise to you and we will help you and we'll take you out to dinner and the 330 million people besides you, they don't matter at all.
[03:50:45.681 --> 03:50:46.301]  We'll be right back.
[03:50:46.301 --> 03:50:47.141]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi.
[03:50:47.141 --> 03:50:48.782]  This is the fourth hour of Total Craziness.

[03:52:00.794 --> 03:52:02.034]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:52:02.034 --> 03:52:03.615]  Rob Dew joins us.
[03:52:03.615 --> 03:52:06.656]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:52:06.656 --> 03:52:07.796]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:52:07.796 --> 03:52:08.756]  I've been working all day.
[03:52:08.756 --> 03:52:11.257]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:52:11.257 --> 03:52:12.677]  I get in here at 830.
[03:52:12.677 --> 03:52:14.578]  I was kind of run down.
[03:52:14.578 --> 03:52:16.538]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[03:52:16.538 --> 03:52:18.399]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:52:18.399 --> 03:52:20.239]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there.
[03:52:20.239 --> 03:52:21.300]  I popped two of them.
[03:52:21.300 --> 03:52:22.900]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like,
[03:52:23.080 --> 03:52:25.363]  I think everything just kind of clears up.
[03:52:25.363 --> 03:52:27.025]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:52:27.025 --> 03:52:28.347]  People really love it.

[03:52:38.220 --> 03:52:42.282]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:52:42.282 --> 03:52:48.425]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:52:48.425 --> 03:52:54.348]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[03:54:18.664 --> 03:54:21.487]  Welcome back to the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show live.
[03:54:21.487 --> 03:54:28.934]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi with Leanne McAdoo and Rob Doohan here on Facebook Mentions, Periscope, every possible live streaming app in the entire planet.
[03:54:28.934 --> 03:54:36.801]  And we've been talking about all the insane news, the Scalia stuff that's come out, which sounds like something out of a fairy tale novel gone bad.
[03:54:36.801 --> 03:54:39.063]  A dark Disney fairy tale novel.
[03:54:39.764 --> 03:54:45.325]  The 7,000 people that Big Pharma's targeting to keep their price gouging in order and not caring about you.
[03:54:45.325 --> 03:54:47.606]  Leanne, let's talk about this debate for a minute.
[03:54:47.606 --> 03:54:51.787]  It's very possible that Rubio and Cruz are going to try and go for Trump's jugular.
[03:54:51.787 --> 03:54:56.908]  And first thing comes to my mind is why would they do that?
[03:54:56.908 --> 03:54:58.948]  Because that will just give him more attention.
[03:54:58.948 --> 03:55:01.068]  But it is possible they still want to be in the race.
[03:55:01.068 --> 03:55:03.509]  They still think that he could be destroyed at some point.
[03:55:03.509 --> 03:55:04.209]  What's your take on this?
[03:55:04.209 --> 03:55:05.349]  What do you think is going to happen tonight?
[03:55:05.349 --> 03:55:08.210]  And you're going to be covering it with a bunch of InfoWars reporters tonight, aren't you?
[03:55:08.770 --> 03:55:09.471]  Absolutely.
[03:55:09.471 --> 03:55:11.832]  We're going live at 7 until about 10 o'clock.
[03:55:11.832 --> 03:55:17.036]  And Rob, do just let me know that we're actually going to be trying out an instant playback tonight.
[03:55:17.036 --> 03:55:21.659]  So in case we miss anything, we'll be able to play back what they've just said.
[03:55:21.659 --> 03:55:24.221]  Jacari Jackson will be manning that station.
[03:55:24.221 --> 03:55:30.044]  But yeah, I think that Rubio and Cruz are going to have to please their establishment handlers.
[03:55:30.044 --> 03:55:31.746]  They're all saying, take down Trump.
[03:55:31.746 --> 03:55:33.066]  We must take him out.
[03:55:33.066 --> 03:55:33.627]  It's time.
[03:55:33.627 --> 03:55:34.087]  Take him out.
[03:55:34.087 --> 03:55:38.210]  The New York Times guy is tweeting a funny tweet about
[03:55:38.770 --> 03:55:39.932]  Assassinating him.
[03:55:39.932 --> 03:55:42.014]  So, you know, they're all saying it's time to take him out.
[03:55:42.014 --> 03:55:47.439]  So if Rubio and Cruz don't go after Trump and they only go after each other, which is what they seem to be doing.
[03:55:47.439 --> 03:55:48.861]  But that doesn't seem like it would work.
[03:55:48.861 --> 03:55:50.943]  It doesn't seem like it usually works when they attack him.
[03:55:50.943 --> 03:55:52.945]  It almost just gives him more fire and more bait.
[03:55:52.945 --> 03:55:54.467]  And it just makes him have more time.
[03:55:54.467 --> 03:55:56.569]  And when they mention him, he gets to speak longer.
[03:55:57.089 --> 03:56:04.631]  Well, and see, even just this article you were talking about before the break with the big pharma and the 7,000 important people, the rest of us don't matter.
[03:56:04.631 --> 03:56:11.374]  It's just, how can the establishment not realize that we are all ready for their heads to roll?
[03:56:11.374 --> 03:56:15.475]  Like, they're all sitting on top of their ivory tower going, ooh, the rebel rousers seem to be...
[03:56:16.315 --> 03:56:16.776]  I think so.
[03:56:39.393 --> 03:56:44.955]  Bernie Sanders is really the quote-unquote anti-establishment candidate as well on the Democratic side.
[03:56:44.955 --> 03:56:52.157]  As I've said a million times before, and I think people would probably want to hang me for saying it, he has a lot of good stances on certain things.
[03:56:52.157 --> 03:56:53.057]  He's against the NSA.
[03:56:53.057 --> 03:56:55.118]  He's mostly anti-establishment.
[03:56:55.118 --> 03:57:03.580]  It's just when you get into other areas that people aren't aware of that you start to realize, hey, 90-plus percent tax for people that make any amount of money at all is really not a good idea.
[03:57:03.580 --> 03:57:04.341]  Right.
[03:57:04.341 --> 03:57:05.801]  So that's discountable.
[03:57:06.221 --> 03:57:07.082]  It's not going to work.
[03:57:07.082 --> 03:57:12.589]  But, at the same time, Trump, there's a lot of, you know, anti-establishment, but there's some things with him too that you could question.
[03:57:12.589 --> 03:57:12.809]  Right.
[03:57:12.809 --> 03:57:25.644]  So at the same time, what the common thread is though, that they're both considered to be anti-establishment, and someone like Marco Rubio is the example of the establishment, and I think that he is actually a computer system with a floppy disk in the back of his head.
[03:57:26.505 --> 03:57:28.966]  And tonight, the floppy disk could pop out any time.
[03:57:28.966 --> 03:57:33.407]  Like, if someone were to just tap him on the back of the head like that, the floppy disk could pop out.
[03:57:33.407 --> 03:57:34.807]  Repeat, repeat.
[03:57:34.807 --> 03:57:37.408]  I was saying he could have a Milli Vanilli moment, too.
[03:57:37.408 --> 03:57:38.248]  Remember that?
[03:57:38.248 --> 03:57:38.548]  Yeah.
[03:57:38.548 --> 03:57:38.808]  Right?
[03:57:38.808 --> 03:57:41.129]  Well, it's just where the CD track skips, he could do that.
[03:57:41.129 --> 03:57:46.730]  He could be saying, like, it's clear that Obama... It's clear that Obama... It's clear that Obama... It could go over and over and over again.
[03:57:46.730 --> 03:57:47.751]  So we never know.
[03:57:47.751 --> 03:57:48.831]  We never know what could happen, right?
[03:57:48.831 --> 03:57:50.192]  Right, well they're all puppets.
[03:57:50.192 --> 03:57:53.434]  They're all, you know, except for Trump, you know?
[03:57:53.434 --> 03:58:02.901]  And even I would say, I would dare say Bernie Sanders, even though I don't... I don't know who's puppets, but I will say that it is annoying when people sound fake.
[03:58:02.901 --> 03:58:08.886]  When they try to sound statesmanly, and they try to be presentable, but it just comes off as fake and artificial.
[03:58:08.886 --> 03:58:10.747]  It just comes off as super, super fake.
[03:58:10.747 --> 03:58:14.350]  Someone that speaks like a regular human being would be much more appealing to me.
[03:58:15.367 --> 03:58:17.530]  Alright, so we are done.
[03:58:17.530 --> 03:58:23.698]  Catch the live debate coverage tonight at 7 o'clock with Leanne and the rest of the InfoWars reporters.
[03:58:23.698 --> 03:58:27.884]  It'll be a lot of interesting breakdown and it's supposed to be very, very brutal.
[03:58:27.884 --> 03:58:30.287]  I'm Anthony Gucciardi and thanks so much for watching the 4th Hour.
