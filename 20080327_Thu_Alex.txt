[01:43.240 --> 01:50.080]  set up international institutions to criminally lobby and buy up control of
[01:50.080 --> 01:56.320]  our governments to then turn the government into a conduit or a straw to
[01:56.320 --> 02:02.680]  suck the economic life force and cultural life force out of every
[02:02.680 --> 02:13.360]  sovereign nation on the surface of terror terror firma this planet so we are

[03:31.320 --> 03:37.200]  the regular clocks and that this is being adopted worldwide and so I want to
[03:37.200 --> 03:40.520]  spend a few minutes explaining why this is a bad idea people say well it's just

[08:52.360 --> 08:57.360]  media eight years ago saying bohemian grove didn't exist the New York Times
[08:57.360 --> 09:01.280]  said it doesn't exist in either this Bilderberg even though New York Times
[09:01.280 --> 09:07.720]  editor-in-chief goes to both routinely editors throughout the decades ago they
[09:07.720 --> 09:12.720]  said it doesn't exist and we're literally insane just like CNN doesn't
[09:12.720 --> 09:17.320]  this insult your intelligence that CNN and Fox we've played the clips here got
[09:17.320 --> 09:21.600]  up and said Ron Paul was nutty that was a CNN quote that he believed in
[09:21.600 --> 09:25.600]  something called the trans texas corridor and they all had like five
[09:25.600 --> 09:32.440]  people on the panel all laughed in unison Fox said the same thing it
[09:32.440 --> 09:39.840]  doesn't exist 8,000 miles of existing roads publicly being taken over and
[09:39.840 --> 09:44.720]  having toll roads put on them new roads almost every major new road having toll
[09:44.720 --> 09:48.280]  roads slapped on it and the documents have come out from the budget that it's
[09:48.280 --> 09:52.520]  all been paid for by our gas money gas receipts are way up they don't care
[09:52.520 --> 09:59.280]  it's all about raping the people then it turns out that centra has put in no
[09:59.280 --> 10:04.880]  money other than lobbying money and has promised a billion dollars in
[10:04.880 --> 10:10.520]  something that is hundreds of billions of dollars in taxpayer built roads it's
[10:10.520 --> 10:14.080]  simple you buy a few politicians they hand the roads over there's billboards
[10:14.080 --> 10:18.720]  TV ads you go see movies in Texas most movie theaters in the last few years
[10:18.720 --> 10:24.240]  most of you seen it run run cartoon ads for the text tag and the trans texas
[10:24.240 --> 10:30.600]  corridor there's I don't know how many there are I've seen them on like 15
[10:30.600 --> 10:35.400]  different more than that just all over Austin all over Austin are giant
[10:35.400 --> 10:41.040]  trans texas corridor signs with a guy with a cowboy hat leaning out of his
[10:41.040 --> 10:45.800]  truck saying it's texting to be to be taxed I mean it's disgusting put a
[10:45.800 --> 10:50.640]  cowboy on and people buy it around here doesn't exist doesn't matter if you try
[10:50.640 --> 10:54.680]  to turn six corridor on you'll be on the city texas website federal websites
[10:54.680 --> 11:01.760]  they just say it doesn't exist well when I snuck into Bohemian Grove eight years
[11:01.760 --> 11:08.760]  ago with Mike Hansen by the way people got mad at me for saying I didn't go
[11:08.760 --> 11:14.800]  into every 2,700 acres and I didn't I didn't go into every camp and I didn't
[11:14.800 --> 11:21.600]  show everything that was in there I was inside the Grove for five hours an hour
[11:21.600 --> 11:27.360]  of that in the dark for the 30 minutes or so that I was walking through the
[11:27.360 --> 11:35.280]  forest pathway in the little gorge amongst the Sequoia redwoods I had
[11:35.280 --> 11:40.240]  Secret Service sheriff's deputies questioned me they almost you know they
[11:40.240 --> 11:44.000]  were suspicious but we were somewhat calm and then we went and basically head
[11:44.000 --> 11:49.480]  out in the woods till it got dark and filming ritual so some criticism that
[11:49.480 --> 11:53.320]  you know somebody releases a photo of a pentagram at some camp or a photo of
[11:53.320 --> 12:04.760]  some statue and then Alex didn't show it it's 2,700 acres I was probably walked
[12:04.760 --> 12:12.320]  through the middle of in my what I could see was about 200 acres and that's not
[12:12.320 --> 12:16.040]  even I mean that's what I could see at the edge of my vision I was in the
[12:16.040 --> 12:22.200]  gorge there's other areas of the camp it doesn't matter there's no point in
[12:22.200 --> 12:28.240]  answering criticism it doesn't matter why didn't you go up and talk to George
[12:28.240 --> 12:33.280]  Bush take a camera in his face well he'd already had me arrested once I wasn't
[12:33.280 --> 12:36.840]  gonna walk up and tell him please take your black hood off please take the
[12:36.840 --> 12:45.880]  skull paint off and please give me an interview sir but we're a nation of
[12:45.880 --> 12:50.640]  winers it is true I wine but I wine about them destroying the dollar and
[12:50.640 --> 12:54.760]  putting cancer viruses in the vaccines and sodium fluoride in the water but I
[12:54.760 --> 12:58.680]  do not want about those of us that are fighting back even though I don't agree
[12:58.680 --> 13:01.640]  with the way a lot of people do it at least they've got guts and guts is
[13:01.640 --> 13:07.640]  enough but I'm already digressing the point is this didn't exist you know I
[13:07.640 --> 13:12.080]  forgot go pull the Alex Jones David Gergen clip I don't think I've ever
[13:12.080 --> 13:17.240]  even played that on the radio Google that down trying to get a good version
[13:17.240 --> 13:20.200]  there's some that have been copied so many times on the web that the audio is
[13:20.200 --> 13:23.800]  even hammered but just type in Alex Jones David Gergen into YouTube brother
[13:23.800 --> 13:27.600]  and find that clip I'm gonna play that with it I should have thought of that
[13:27.600 --> 13:39.960]  John but this isn't the 2004 RNC where I'm walking along on one of the side
[13:39.960 --> 13:44.280]  streets behind Madison Square Garden and here comes David Gergen out of a car
[13:44.280 --> 13:52.920]  and I seem so we run over and interview him and then he blows up and starts
[13:52.920 --> 13:57.120]  basically poking me and getting in my face and he lost it and I said tell me
[13:57.120 --> 14:07.040]  about the rituals and he said that's none of your bleeping business and so this
[14:07.040 --> 14:12.800]  is Governor Ridge just coming out and saying yeah it's a it wouldn't have
[14:12.800 --> 14:16.280]  looked right it wouldn't be good if I went to that I I have been invited but
[14:16.280 --> 14:20.080]  I it wouldn't look good if they had a Homeland Security went to that you know
[14:20.080 --> 14:23.880]  I fly with the sparrows not the Eagles you know I'm not an elitist he's saying
[14:23.880 --> 14:31.560]  and why wouldn't it look good for him to be there it wouldn't look good for him
[14:31.560 --> 14:38.640]  to be there because the entire thing is homoerotic and that's been admitted in
[14:38.640 --> 14:45.640]  major publications that they ship in the $2,000 an hour mail prostitutes the
[14:45.640 --> 14:53.520]  thing was founded on being homoerotic in the 1870s and that is the overhanging
[14:53.520 --> 15:01.680]  this is a bare minimum homosexual guilt but then the taste run as they do and
[15:01.680 --> 15:07.000]  almost every imperial culture in the pedophilia the forbidden and that's just
[15:07.000 --> 15:10.800]  a fact I mean how many Homeland Security deputy directors and chiefs have been
[15:10.800 --> 15:15.960]  caught I mean just Google it huh it's in the hundreds I mean it's it's gay
[15:15.960 --> 15:21.760]  bathroom sex with the senator is is he is nothing and don't send me emails
[15:21.760 --> 15:27.320]  saying I'm being bigoted in bashing come on 200 300 sexual partners a month
[15:27.320 --> 15:37.560]  that is bad Ron Paul got criticized for an 89 writing an article where he said
[15:37.560 --> 15:42.640]  the gays in San Francisco want AIDS and as a physician you know I've seen the
[15:42.640 --> 15:47.560]  reports on this they said oh well four years ago article called bug chasers
[15:47.560 --> 15:54.040]  from the cover of Rolling Stone was how they all want to catch AIDS in San
[15:54.040 --> 16:01.920]  Francisco they call it gift givers and gift receivers and it was a big article
[16:01.920 --> 16:06.600]  last week about California schools want to teach sixth graders a book with
[16:06.600 --> 16:15.320]  things I can't even read eating feces giving each other AIDS I mean things I
[16:15.320 --> 16:22.440]  can't even if I read the passages here they are it is just off the charts and
[16:22.440 --> 16:27.280]  I'm not allowed to say you know I don't think children should be taught about
[16:27.280 --> 16:31.120]  sex period you know the dare program increase drug use you show them drugs
[16:31.120 --> 16:34.920]  show them how to use it drug use goes up just like they started this federal
[16:34.920 --> 16:40.720]  suicide anti-suicide courses death education in 1992 ever since then
[16:40.720 --> 16:45.000]  suicides exploded you think 12 year olds ever thought about suicide or how to put
[16:45.000 --> 16:53.520]  a tourniquet around their neck or how to hang it onto a closet pole and little
[16:53.520 --> 16:59.880]  girls go and do that they know exactly what they're doing I mean BF skinner
[16:59.880 --> 17:04.520]  locked his son up to die in a chamber made him live in a little chamber for
[17:04.520 --> 17:08.920]  years and killed him and then he's hailed as good I mean murdering your
[17:08.920 --> 17:13.440]  children these people get so sick they've done everything they're nihilistic
[17:13.440 --> 17:17.520]  see when you're self-serving and that's all you care about you turn out being
[17:17.520 --> 17:24.480]  totally unhappy but you are fulfilled when you try to help others and have
[17:24.480 --> 17:29.560]  courage and fight evil because you're designed to do it life just gets more
[17:29.560 --> 17:33.400]  and more fulfilling more and more better more and more wonderful I mean it's like
[17:33.400 --> 17:39.000]  blessings every second everything is sheer beauty except when you look at the
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  new world order and you even see the the ugliness even more clearly I mean it's
[17:43.000 --> 17:52.520]  just exhilarating it's like a Valhalla love flows people say well you sound
[17:52.520 --> 18:03.760]  angry and vicious that is the guardian of love that is the guardian spirit and
[18:03.760 --> 18:11.920]  it hates that which wants to hurt innocence and you all have that in
[18:11.920 --> 18:15.760]  grain programming in you and you have not activated it you could be so happy
[18:15.760 --> 18:21.160]  when you got rid of your fear and committed committed to fighting evil
[18:21.160 --> 18:26.760]  you will be fulfilled but if you're not you're gonna end up with human feces on
[18:26.760 --> 18:30.720]  a plate eating it thinking that you've got some new delicacy and that you're
[18:30.720 --> 18:35.520]  denigrating yourself and then it somehow is some new thing I mean it's
[18:35.520 --> 18:42.080]  either it's either that it's either it's either eating feces or Valhalla well
[18:42.080 --> 18:46.120]  which one do you want I mean do you want God and life and the spirit that
[18:46.120 --> 18:51.120]  energizes the universe that makes the flowers grow that makes the trees come
[18:51.120 --> 18:55.320]  up out of the ground that makes the fish swarm in the sea and a rainbow of a
[18:55.320 --> 19:07.120]  billion colors the rolling thunder the lightning horses in the morning mist
[19:07.120 --> 19:12.400]  galloping through the meadow or do you want Iraq and dead bodies and dead

[24:20.840 --> 24:26.240]  segment. By the way, Paul Watson did a story last week. It was also in World
[24:26.240 --> 24:31.440]  End Daily about the textbooks for sixth and seventh graders in California. And as
[24:31.440 --> 24:39.680]  hardcore as what I said was earlier, it's nothing. You understand? They want to
[24:39.680 --> 24:44.440]  destroy that innocence. And you know why? Because when somebody is young and
[24:44.440 --> 24:50.600]  delicate and innocent, they can literally interface with life so much
[24:50.600 --> 24:57.120]  stronger. And the enemy wants to come in and block that, blunt that. They want to
[24:57.120 --> 25:03.160]  take that innocence, that time for the soul to grow before our children like
[25:03.160 --> 25:07.680]  ships are launched into the great ocean. That is adulthood and life. To face the
[25:07.680 --> 25:15.560]  tribulations, to face the challenges. All right, let's go ahead. Let's go ahead and
[25:15.560 --> 25:19.920]  play. Governor Ridge being asked about the Satanic, homoerotic, Bohemian grove
[25:19.920 --> 25:23.600]  and saying he's not part of it, from Gary Franchi, the Long Lantern Society.
[25:23.600 --> 25:27.480]  Yes, sir. I'm doing fine. How are you doing? Very good. I have a question for you. Sure.
[25:27.480 --> 25:32.280]  Who am I talking to? My name's Gary Franchi. I'm with RestoreTheRepublic.com and
[25:32.280 --> 25:38.360]  LongLantern.org. As former director of the Homeland Security Department, do you
[25:38.360 --> 25:42.480]  think that the Amaro, the proposed currency for North America, will provide
[25:42.480 --> 25:48.360]  the United States with a stronger country? Or do you think it will hurt us
[25:48.360 --> 25:52.880]  because we're moving into a different currency structure? I don't quite understand what you mean.
[25:52.880 --> 25:59.120]  The Amaro, the proposed currency for North America with Mexico,
[25:59.120 --> 26:04.120]  the United States, the North American Union. You know, I think if you have a common
[26:04.120 --> 26:07.880]  currency, you normally have to have a common banking infrastructure. You have a
[26:07.880 --> 26:11.400]  common banking infrastructure. You have to have a common, the equivalent of a
[26:11.400 --> 26:15.760]  common Federal Reserve. And I don't think, you know, I just, you know, I think, I
[26:15.760 --> 26:20.240]  think the economies can be integrated, but I just don't see any future for a
[26:20.240 --> 26:26.960]  common currency in the immediate future. I just, there are still, I'm quite sure
[26:26.960 --> 26:31.800]  there'll be resistance in all three countries to do work. Look, it took the Europeans
[26:31.800 --> 26:36.760]  50 years to get that far, and I suspect we're 50 or 100 years from even talking
[26:36.760 --> 26:41.960]  seriously about it. Would you support a new investigation for 9-11 as the family
[26:41.960 --> 26:47.560]  members have suggested and requested? I haven't heard the basis of their, the
[26:47.560 --> 26:51.840]  concern that a lot of 9-11 members had. Well, the controlled demolition of the
[26:51.840 --> 26:55.520]  World Trade Center? I just don't buy that. I mean, I'm just sorry. I'm just, I just,
[26:55.520 --> 27:00.160]  that's a conspiracy theory that has absolutely no reasonable basis, in fact.
[27:00.160 --> 27:04.120]  I mean, is this the crowd that thinks the government, that thinks there were some...
[27:04.120 --> 27:07.720]  I don't think there's a lot of questions that need to be answered. I don't think the 9-11
[27:07.720 --> 27:13.160]  Commission report... Well, I don't, I, you know, I, I think, well, listen, I don't, I hope you
[27:13.160 --> 27:19.040]  read the 9-11 Commission. They were pretty dogged on thorough, and it's, it's almost
[27:19.040 --> 27:22.240]  like out of the twilight zone. It's just too, no, I don't think they ought to open it.
[27:22.240 --> 27:27.000]  What about the real ID? You think that's gonna bring us safer, country? Yeah, real
[27:27.000 --> 27:30.040]  idea. People have asked me that question. Now, all these are my opinions, not
[27:30.040 --> 27:34.920]  John McCain's. Oh, I understand. All right? Sure. My opinion, not John McCain's. Number one, as a
[27:34.920 --> 27:37.880]  governor, the real idea is a bad idea, because you gave me a mandate and you're
[27:37.880 --> 27:41.800]  not willing to fund it. I don't like that at all as a governor. Number two, at some
[27:41.800 --> 27:45.400]  point in time, I think in order to fight crime, in order to fight terrorism, in order
[27:45.400 --> 27:49.920]  to fight government fraud, in order to fight identity theft, some form of
[27:49.920 --> 27:53.920]  standard form of national identification would be very helpful. It's not just to
[27:53.920 --> 27:58.280]  defeat terrorism and combat crime, but there's a gazillion dollar industry
[27:58.280 --> 28:02.240]  called identity theft. It would probably save a lot of people a lot of money and
[28:02.240 --> 28:05.640]  the theft of their identities if you had something like that. But I, we still
[28:05.640 --> 28:08.100]  haven't gotten around the issues of privacy and who would have that
[28:08.100 --> 28:11.920]  information, and at the end of the day, I still think we got a lot of work to do.
[28:11.920 --> 28:15.840]  There's a lot of states that are putting up opposition to it, and do you think
[28:15.840 --> 28:18.960]  that the federal government will be successful in implementing it, or do you
[28:18.960 --> 28:24.640]  think that the states will be successful in defeating it? Well, I, again, first of
[28:24.640 --> 28:30.920]  all, the legislation that created the Department of Homeland Security said
[28:30.920 --> 28:36.720]  that the first secretary and successive secretaries know national ID. So
[28:36.720 --> 28:41.800]  Congress said, all right, no national ID, let's just try to standardize a driver's
[28:41.800 --> 28:46.800]  license. Not a bad idea. I think people a little bit, we look more comfortable with
[28:46.800 --> 28:51.720]  a state standardized driver's license than a national ID. But having said that,
[28:51.720 --> 28:56.240]  let's say there's billions of dollars associated with retrofitting all your
[28:56.240 --> 29:00.000]  driver's license. No, I think, I think that the states would be more inclined to
[29:00.000 --> 29:03.220]  do it if the federal government's want to pay for it. Nobody, no governor likes
[29:03.220 --> 29:07.920]  unfunded mandates. I've heard that an RFID partnership would be included in that.
[29:07.920 --> 29:14.920]  An RFID has been known to be able to track America. Oh yeah, listen, I think. Do you want to put an RFID tag in this order? No, no, no, no, no, listen.
[29:14.920 --> 29:21.640]  Well, I know a little bit about RFIDs. And if even a colder day in New Hampshire,
[29:21.640 --> 29:26.040]  then they put an RFID chip in my ID, let me tell you. Hey, stay there. We're gonna
[29:26.040 --> 29:29.400]  come right back and finish up with the Bohemian Grove comment. And I've got
[29:29.400 --> 29:33.960]  obvious analysis of what he's saying and doing. See how slick he is? He sounds
[29:33.960 --> 29:38.400]  reasonable. But we'll tell you the trick when we get back.
[29:38.400 --> 29:52.200]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:52.800 --> 29:57.160]  Gasoline prices are out of control. Are you tired of giving your hard-earned
[29:57.160 --> 30:00.760]  dollars to the major oil companies? Did you know that the oil companies have
[30:00.760 --> 30:04.280]  developed special products to increase mileage in their own vehicles? Very few
[30:04.280 --> 30:09.200]  consumers even know such products exist. SFR has obtained this technology that is
[30:09.200 --> 30:12.600]  backed by testing that the major oil companies have run, yet they don't want
[30:12.600 --> 30:16.600]  you to know about them. This product is made right here in the United States and
[30:16.600 --> 30:21.160]  is not a typical gas treatment found at your local store. SFR lasts up to six
[30:21.160 --> 30:26.600]  months. SFR works so well that it even improves mileage on new cars. SFR
[30:26.600 --> 30:30.440]  recently ran this ad and the response from all over the United States was so
[30:30.440 --> 30:34.680]  strong that they are allowing my listeners to buy one at their regular price of
[30:34.680 --> 30:39.440]  $9.95 and get another one free of charge. If you are not completely delighted with
[30:39.440 --> 30:43.760]  the savings, SFR will refund the purchase price and shipping, share in the oil
[30:43.760 --> 30:51.440]  company's secret, and get SFR now. Call 888-USE-SFR-1. That's 888-USE-SFR-1
[30:51.440 --> 30:56.680]  today. U.S. Civil Flags.org is here to help Americans remember as well as our

[33:05.800 --> 33:09.720]  Got a mixed prize guest coming up scheduled in the third hour. Huge guest
[33:09.720 --> 33:13.640]  tomorrow. Gigantic guest next week.
[33:13.640 --> 33:18.040]  And just gets bigger and bigger into the month of April that we're
[33:18.040 --> 33:22.760]  moving towards rather quickly here. All right, I know we got loaded phone lines.
[33:22.760 --> 33:25.320]  We're gonna do your calls in a moment. Finishing up with the great questions
[33:25.320 --> 33:29.560]  that Yuri Franchi and others, I mean you don't just have we are
[33:29.560 --> 33:32.600]  changed or the info wars groups that are out there. You got Lone Lantern, you got
[33:32.600 --> 33:36.040]  all these other groups that are out doing the same thing in front of these
[33:36.040 --> 33:38.760]  politicians, bringing up real questions. They're polite when the
[33:38.760 --> 33:42.200]  politicians polite. When they're not, they're not.
[33:42.200 --> 33:45.960]  And this is the American people's right. And that's why the system is scared
[33:45.960 --> 33:49.000]  because we're coming out of our holes, we're going to their media events,
[33:49.000 --> 33:53.320]  and we're confronting them with real issues. Back to the former head of
[33:53.320 --> 33:57.720]  Homeland Security. If it'd be even a colder day in New
[33:57.720 --> 34:01.720]  Hampshire, then they'd put an RFID chip in my ID, let me tell you.
[34:01.720 --> 34:05.240]  Because, you know, as you put it, you track people.
[34:05.240 --> 34:09.000]  And we're, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. I think biometric
[34:09.000 --> 34:12.680]  identification, I mean literally millions of Americans,
[34:12.680 --> 34:15.960]  something like that would be helpful because you really get around identity
[34:15.960 --> 34:19.800]  fraud. But there's, there's still a lot of
[34:19.800 --> 34:24.200]  security loopholes in our ID. No, no, a thousand times no.
[34:24.200 --> 34:28.440]  The only thing with RFID, I don't want to, maybe I'll put on my dog's collar.
[34:28.440 --> 34:32.440]  An RFID on my dog's collar, but not on my, not on my driver's license.
[34:32.440 --> 34:35.800]  No way. So you're out here today supporting
[34:35.800 --> 34:38.520]  McCain? Have you been traveling with them? A little bit, my third
[34:38.520 --> 34:42.600]  trip to New Hampshire. Were you in Iowa? I'm not, no. My third trip here and
[34:42.600 --> 34:47.080]  John and I got elected in 1982 together. Oh, wow.
[34:47.080 --> 34:50.920]  And I've always admired his political and his physical courage,
[34:50.920 --> 34:55.000]  his candor. I like to straight talk and I think he's got the character
[34:55.000 --> 34:58.040]  demonstrated in military and in politics to be a great leader. How do you feel
[34:58.040 --> 35:00.840]  about the council on four relations and are you a member?
[35:00.840 --> 35:04.760]  No. Well, I've talked to them several times. I've read a lot of their reports,
[35:04.760 --> 35:08.520]  but they're like any other organization. They've got a point of view
[35:08.520 --> 35:11.880]  and as I make my final decisions, I like to hear multiple points of view and I'm
[35:11.880 --> 35:15.720]  not a member. And what about the Bilderberg group or the
[35:15.720 --> 35:19.160]  trilateral? Have you ever been invited or gone to a meeting? No.
[35:19.160 --> 35:21.960]  What about the Bohemian Grove? Have you ever gone out there?
[35:21.960 --> 35:24.440]  Nope. Do you know folks that have gone out there? I've known a lot of folks that
[35:24.440 --> 35:27.240]  have gone out there. I don't listen. Have you ever been invited? Those are idols I
[35:27.240 --> 35:30.520]  run with asperos. Those many eagles run with asperos?
[35:30.520 --> 35:34.200]  Yeah, listen, I know a lot of people gone out there, some of them are friends of mine.
[35:34.200 --> 35:37.960]  I was invited once when I was secretary of the Homeland Security. I thought
[35:37.960 --> 35:40.680]  last place in the world I want to be a secretary of Homeland Security is the
[35:40.680 --> 35:44.680]  Bohemian Grove. It looked bad, wasn't right, and so it didn't go. Real simple.
[35:44.680 --> 35:48.840]  Yeah, I've heard that they do a mock sacrifice in front of a big stone owl.
[35:48.840 --> 35:52.120]  They do a lot of weird stuff out there. Have you heard that?
[35:52.120 --> 35:56.600]  I'm not going down that path because I don't have a clue what they do. Never been there.
[35:56.600 --> 35:59.880]  I haven't been invited since I left politics and that's okay too.
[35:59.880 --> 36:04.120]  A lot of places. Okay, that's it. Really, really good job and that's the
[36:04.120 --> 36:07.800]  Lone Lantern Society and to infowars.com. You can see that
[36:07.800 --> 36:12.280]  nprisonplanet.com and Aaron did a good little report on it. You can send out
[36:12.280 --> 36:16.040]  to folks if you'd like an article. Probably easiest place to find at
[36:16.040 --> 36:19.000]  showsreport.com because that site gets only gets updated about once a day.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.400]  Sometimes twice a day. The others are getting updated like five times a day
[36:21.400 --> 36:25.640]  now so stuff moves down the page so fast since we put it up there yesterday
[36:25.640 --> 36:28.680]  afternoon. I want to play this gergen clip but
[36:28.680 --> 36:33.880]  without spending an hour analyzing Ridge. Now you know why he was a member of
[36:33.880 --> 36:37.880]  Congress. Now you know why he was a governor. Now you
[36:37.880 --> 36:40.520]  know why he was the first Homeland Security Director.
[36:40.520 --> 36:46.280]  The guy is slick but I happen to have watched Governor Ridge for two hours
[36:46.280 --> 36:50.120]  before his department even got funded in 2002
[36:50.120 --> 36:55.800]  on C-SPAN. He said you're going to have a tracker chip in your all your IDs to
[36:55.800 --> 36:58.920]  have jobs. You'll be tracked everywhere with it.
[36:58.920 --> 37:01.800]  You'll have to have this. We're gonna we're gonna get rid of posicom and
[37:01.800 --> 37:06.040]  taught us. He said that on Fox and CNN too.
[37:06.040 --> 37:09.080]  But then you notice when he talks to a crowd he's just like McCain.
[37:09.080 --> 37:12.520]  It's not straight talk. It's the opposite.
[37:12.520 --> 37:15.640]  I mean Hillary's in a lot of trouble right now for lying and saying
[37:15.640 --> 37:19.000]  she almost got shot down over Bosnia. Now the pilots come out and said
[37:19.000 --> 37:22.680]  nobody shot at him. Nothing happened. It's a total lie.
[37:22.680 --> 37:26.360]  Of course that's all they do is lie.
[37:27.080 --> 37:30.520]  Oh man and people say well it's okay then both parties lie.
[37:30.520 --> 37:34.200]  No that's what's so bad. Both parties are owned by the same people.
[37:34.200 --> 37:38.600]  We have a controlled simulated fight between the two sides. Everybody weighs
[37:38.600 --> 37:41.720]  in for one of the two fake sides and then the globalists control the whole
[37:41.720 --> 37:44.200]  paradigm.
[37:46.440 --> 37:51.400]  It's just incredible but Ridge
[37:51.400 --> 37:54.360]  for talking about you need to read the homeland. You know you need to read the
[37:54.360 --> 37:58.040]  report put out by the 9-11 commission
[37:58.040 --> 38:01.880]  and then you read it and it was appointed by Bush
[38:01.880 --> 38:05.240]  and then it turned out what we already told you was the case. Zellacal ran the
[38:05.240 --> 38:08.680]  whole thing and it was staged. They wanted to have Kissinger running it
[38:08.680 --> 38:12.360]  first and what do they recommend? Biometrics, RFID,
[38:12.360 --> 38:16.360]  total control, 51 recommendations that were word for word
[38:16.360 --> 38:20.920]  the 51 recommendations of the Council on Foreign Relations
[38:20.920 --> 38:25.320]  Committee, the Hart Rubin Commission from three years previous.
[38:25.320 --> 38:28.840]  Remember the same commission that got up and said two days up for 9-11?
[38:28.840 --> 38:32.520]  We need we need to use this disaster to bring in a new world order?
[38:32.520 --> 38:39.960]  Gary Hart. Gary Hart writes letters to Iran saying our government stages attacks.
[38:39.960 --> 38:42.840]  Don't think just because 80% of the people are against us attacking you in
[38:42.840 --> 38:46.840]  the U.S. that we won't stage events.
[38:46.840 --> 38:53.240]  He wrote a letter saying that to Ahmadinejid
[38:53.240 --> 38:56.680]  knowing that the general public doesn't read.
[38:56.680 --> 39:02.200]  It was in a few papers but it was they'll probably come out and say they
[39:02.200 --> 39:05.720]  did it and then if you say well how dare you they'll say I didn't
[39:05.720 --> 39:09.000]  say that. I mean they say the trans-Texas
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.880]  corridor doesn't exist. They say the Bohemian Grove doesn't exist. They say
[39:11.880 --> 39:14.120]  the trilateral commission doesn't exist.
[39:14.120 --> 39:17.000]  I keep saying about eight years ago. Eight years ago when they started admitting
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.880]  some of this existed some places but there was overlap.
[39:19.880 --> 39:24.360]  Radio and TV and some newspapers hadn't gotten the memo I guess
[39:24.360 --> 39:27.720]  and so they were by still I go on some shows today and they say
[39:27.720 --> 39:32.600]  you believe in the imaginary Bilderberg group and CFR.
[39:33.800 --> 39:36.840]  In fact try it with your family. Bring up the CFR at dinner
[39:36.840 --> 39:39.960]  and I would imagine I mean let's see you got 5-10 family members over for
[39:39.960 --> 39:43.400]  Sunday dinner or something say your brothers and sisters and their
[39:43.400 --> 39:46.840]  husbands and wives are over. Get your parents over
[39:46.840 --> 39:49.880]  and I guarantee you bring up the CFR at dinner.
[39:49.880 --> 39:54.200]  Somebody out of 10 people is going to say it doesn't exist.
[39:54.200 --> 39:59.880]  You know why I get frustrated because I'm tired of that response.
[39:59.880 --> 40:02.920]  I'm tired of it.
[40:06.520 --> 40:09.320]  And you notice Ridge didn't deny the human sacrifice,
[40:09.320 --> 40:13.320]  the simulated human sacrifice going on. He just said well that's why I don't
[40:13.320 --> 40:15.960]  go. You know I don't want to get into that. I
[40:15.960 --> 40:19.480]  don't know nothing about it. I hadn't been
[40:19.480 --> 40:24.840]  because they all know. Then Ridge talks about identity theft being stopped by
[40:24.840 --> 40:27.880]  well we're not going to have a national ID. We're going to have a
[40:27.880 --> 40:32.200]  standardized driver's license. We've had a standardized driver's license since
[40:32.200 --> 40:35.960]  the mid-1990s. It's been a global standardized
[40:35.960 --> 40:40.120]  and the globalists are smart. They set in 2000 after years of codifying and
[40:40.120 --> 40:44.520]  having different government groups and the engineers,
[40:44.520 --> 40:50.440]  the social architects meeting and it's all in the UN record.
[40:50.440 --> 40:53.640]  Hundreds of millions of dollars spent conferring and preparing it. They said
[40:53.640 --> 40:57.000]  look too many countries have already adopted systems
[40:57.000 --> 41:00.280]  but it's only a handful of companies that sold and made the systems. They said
[41:00.280 --> 41:04.120]  we'll just make sure the card has all five of these things.
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.760]  Barcodes, magnetic strips, digital photo for face scan matching,
[41:08.760 --> 41:12.280]  thumb print or index finger.
[41:12.600 --> 41:16.600]  A driver's license number
[41:17.320 --> 41:20.440]  and so they agreed and signed the treaty that the nations would have at least
[41:20.440 --> 41:25.560]  two of those. So it's already global in 2000 and
[41:25.560 --> 41:28.840]  Ridge is saying well I'm for a driver's license being standardized. You want to
[41:28.840 --> 41:34.600]  stop identity theft but I'm not for you know a national ID card.
[41:34.600 --> 41:39.640]  See it's meant to make a yuppie or some retiree who thinks this country isn't
[41:39.640 --> 41:43.640]  run by crooks to feel safe. Oh that's reasonable. See I was all
[41:43.640 --> 41:46.920]  amenable. See the really slick ones like Vicente Fox
[41:46.920 --> 41:50.840]  and Governor Ridge they don't run off or like John Edwards pulled
[41:50.840 --> 41:53.640]  their hand out of your hand when you try to shake it or yell at your freak
[41:53.640 --> 41:57.960]  out. They stop. Even it's Barack Obama he'll stop
[41:57.960 --> 42:00.120]  and smile and say listen I don't have time I gotta go in there give a speech.
[42:00.120 --> 42:05.560]  Okay thank you. McCain's slick. He walks up to 9-11 truthers and takes pictures
[42:05.560 --> 42:08.280]  with them laughing.
[42:12.200 --> 42:16.760]  You see they know they've got to engage you, neutralize you just like they put
[42:16.760 --> 42:21.160]  special forces behind enemy lines to recruit the locals. That's what they do.
[42:21.160 --> 42:26.120]  You know they teach them how to glad hand. This is a black up being run.
[42:26.120 --> 42:29.400]  I said I want to go to your calls but I could go on for hours about just that
[42:29.400 --> 42:32.040]  four minute clip.
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.560]  Number one
[42:36.120 --> 42:40.200]  you can go read the federal and industry studies on where real identity
[42:40.200 --> 42:44.680]  theft comes from. It comes the lion's share. Over 90
[42:44.680 --> 42:52.200]  percent comes from two places. Government and industry leaks.
[42:52.200 --> 42:56.600]  What Bank of America two years ago lost three million profiles social security
[42:56.600 --> 43:02.120]  numbers and names. Three million. Universities are
[43:02.120 --> 43:05.720]  constantly quote losing them that is somebody sells it.
[43:05.720 --> 43:09.640]  I mean every day I see that I mean literally every couple days
[43:09.640 --> 43:13.640]  I see articles were 10,000 names 100,000 names. The entire
[43:13.640 --> 43:19.720]  social security numbers of all of the alumni for the last 45 years it just it
[43:19.720 --> 43:24.680]  was released or was stolen. It comes from government
[43:24.680 --> 43:27.080]  institutions and they just did big British studies a whole bunch of
[43:27.080 --> 43:30.440]  government studies admitting that a national ID card there
[43:30.440 --> 43:35.080]  will increase identity theft just type national ID increases identity theft
[43:35.080 --> 43:38.280]  UK or US they've got studies here they know that
[43:38.280 --> 43:42.520]  then that makes the problem worse. Let me ask you a question you're gonna have
[43:42.520 --> 43:45.400]  lesser more identity theft back in the age when you were writing checks and
[43:45.400 --> 43:48.760]  mailing them or back in the age when you were paying cash for stuff or do you
[43:48.760 --> 43:52.680]  have more with the computers and with the databases and all of this
[43:52.680 --> 43:57.240]  that they insist on if we had more or less but see the media always has Fox
[43:57.240 --> 44:02.520]  5 tonight the internet they're stealing your credit cards
[44:02.520 --> 44:05.320]  and you can go pull up the studies there's a bunch of them showing similar
[44:05.320 --> 44:08.600]  numbers but you're talking four or five percent of credit card theft and things
[44:08.600 --> 44:12.760]  is the internet. You know where it really happens
[44:12.760 --> 44:17.320]  when you call a 1-800 number and a corrupt person
[44:17.320 --> 44:23.720]  operator it could be a charity it could be
[44:23.720 --> 44:28.280]  some big bookseller it could be anything
[44:28.280 --> 44:31.160]  it could be a catalog that you know sells clothing
[44:31.160 --> 44:35.240]  because i've read the studies and i've experienced it
[44:35.240 --> 44:38.360]  and you call up and you know what that person does
[44:38.360 --> 44:42.200]  they take home copies of those credit card numbers and then they fax them or
[44:42.200 --> 44:45.000]  mail them to their cousin in another city or another
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.680]  state or in Africa Nigeria is big to Israel
[44:48.680 --> 44:53.240]  they're big to Turkey to Saudi Arabia to Malaysia
[44:53.240 --> 44:57.720]  to Thailand and then they do it there where it's safe with your credit card
[44:57.720 --> 45:00.600]  number with your data and then they're able
[45:00.600 --> 45:04.120]  to get the money or get the purchases
[45:06.440 --> 45:11.000]  most of it is when you go in i'm not being mean but i've seen the studies
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.400]  and you go into that pakistan gas station or you go into that italian on
[45:15.400 --> 45:18.040]  gas stations because it's normally the foreigners that do it
[45:18.040 --> 45:20.760]  because those have been more corrupt countries more corrupt regimes they
[45:20.760 --> 45:23.640]  don't have the classical ethic of the west to have
[45:23.640 --> 45:26.200]  less corruption we're now even more corrupt than them but the point is
[45:26.200 --> 45:30.200]  this is a family business they they mail it out or they email it out
[45:30.200 --> 45:33.160]  and then it's in another country another jurisdiction it's just tailor made
[45:33.160 --> 45:38.840]  and they can't get busted so you go in you give them your credit card
[45:38.840 --> 45:43.320]  and they just take that data and that's where it's happening it's your credit
[45:43.320 --> 45:49.480]  cards it's the gas stations it's the employee at the store
[45:49.480 --> 45:52.680]  i mean i see reports all the time in industry publications about
[45:52.680 --> 45:57.080]  waiters will take your credit card number and you know sign on a bigger tip or
[45:57.080 --> 46:00.760]  sign on some drinks and then sign a tip out for themselves
[46:00.760 --> 46:03.800]  that's where most of it's happening and i'm not defending the internet it's
[46:03.800 --> 46:08.280]  going on there too but tiny so the very people
[46:08.280 --> 46:12.120]  pushing this the big banks the government are the very ones that are doing
[46:12.120 --> 46:15.160]  this with your data
[46:15.160 --> 46:19.240]  i mean every day we hear about 50 computers a thousand computers
[46:19.240 --> 46:24.520]  97 laptops i mean just type government laptop stolen government laptop with
[46:24.520 --> 46:27.800]  social security numbers lost i mean you see it every two days
[46:27.800 --> 46:31.160]  and i'm not looking for it
[46:33.880 --> 46:36.840]  or you hear about the government people at driver's license facilities in some
[46:36.840 --> 46:41.000]  cases giving thousands of illegals i d cards
[46:41.000 --> 46:44.920]  but they don't need that with a console matricula that anyone can buy for $24
[46:44.920 --> 46:48.360]  you can go into social security card right now
[46:48.360 --> 46:52.360]  and they're telling you oh we want federally standardized to keep you
[46:52.360 --> 46:56.200]  safe all right i've already digressed alex robert rick rico
[46:56.200 --> 47:00.920]  tom we're gonna get to all of you after the break i promise but right now
[47:00.920 --> 47:07.720]  there's a bunch of other points i wrote down here
[47:07.720 --> 47:13.240]  but um just all lies from ridge all twisting all spin all deception
[47:13.240 --> 47:16.920]  other than saying oh that wouldn't look good for me to go to bohemian grove
[47:16.920 --> 47:20.280]  yeah because the cat's out of the bag now buster
[47:20.280 --> 47:27.240]  isn't it let's go ahead and play uh a flashback to four years ago
[47:27.240 --> 47:31.800]  it's been that long this is from the film marshal law three hour
[47:31.800 --> 47:36.920]  summer saying it's my best film marshal law 911 rise of the police state here i
[47:36.920 --> 47:40.200]  am running into david gurgle on the streets of new york
[47:40.200 --> 47:44.600]  one last question i read a washington times article many years ago
[47:44.600 --> 47:47.720]  where you had a comment about the organization and then now it's been in
[47:47.720 --> 47:50.440]  the wall street journal it's been a lot of different newspapers and that's the
[47:50.440 --> 47:54.600]  bohemian grove and back in what was it nineteen
[47:54.600 --> 47:58.920]  96 when you joined as a clinton advisor they were the republicans were
[47:58.920 --> 48:02.520]  criticizing you oh what about bohemian grove and then you counter
[48:02.520 --> 48:05.160]  and then you countered them by saying hey i don't run around on the woods necked
[48:05.160 --> 48:08.280]  what did that mean i don't i don't know what
[48:08.280 --> 48:10.920]  i don't know what quotes you're referring to i'm not aware of any quote
[48:10.920 --> 48:17.080]  like that listen i am a happy member of the
[48:17.080 --> 48:19.800]  bohemian grove i like the the folks who come there
[48:19.800 --> 48:24.200]  and it's really inappropriate for me to talk about a
[48:24.200 --> 48:27.880]  the group beyond them thank you have you been there for the ceremony with the

[54:11.000 --> 54:13.560]  caught the bloody british in a town in new orleans
[54:13.560 --> 54:16.280]  we fired our guns and the british kept becoming
[54:16.280 --> 54:20.680]  there wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired once more and they
[54:20.680 --> 54:23.560]  began to run in on down to mississippi to the gluff of
[54:23.560 --> 54:26.920]  mexico
[54:26.920 --> 54:30.680]  we looked down a river and we see the british come and they must have been a
[54:30.680 --> 54:34.840]  hundred of feet on the drum they stepped so high and they made the bugles
[54:34.840 --> 54:38.040]  ring we stood beside our cotton veils didn't say a thing
[54:38.040 --> 54:40.760]  we fired our guns and the british kept becoming
[54:40.760 --> 54:45.160]  there wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired once more and they
[54:45.160 --> 54:48.040]  began to run in on down to mississippi to the gluff of
[54:48.040 --> 54:53.080]  mexico old hickory old hickory said we could
[54:53.080 --> 54:57.000]  take them by surprise if we didn't fire muskies till we looked them in the eye
[54:57.000 --> 55:01.160]  we held our fire till we see their faces well then we opened up our squirrel guns
[55:01.160 --> 55:05.640]  and merely gave them oh we fired alex in germany thanks for
[55:05.640 --> 55:08.520]  holding you're on the air welcome yes there was a while ago
[55:08.520 --> 55:14.280]  hi alec hello sir hello um we had quite a quite a fun time when we dubbed
[55:14.280 --> 55:18.200]  march along 9 11 in german because sometimes it's got a laugh at these
[55:18.200 --> 55:21.320]  people and you know that during an interview we were just howling with
[55:21.320 --> 55:24.680]  laughter and um i'm calling about two developments
[55:24.680 --> 55:28.680]  in europe both of which could have a significant impact on the united states
[55:28.680 --> 55:31.800]  but before that i wanted to mention how much i enjoyed your rant yesterday
[55:31.800 --> 55:35.640]  about the disinformance because we've actually listened to your advice
[55:35.640 --> 55:39.880]  over the years and we're thriving now and now people make up ludicrous
[55:39.880 --> 55:43.480]  um stories about us ludicrous accusations and they say
[55:43.480 --> 55:47.240]  you know don't don't post your college paper defending the second amendment
[55:47.240 --> 55:51.240]  don't talk about that right wing you know not run pause don't talk about
[55:51.240 --> 55:55.800]  fluoride and eugenics talk about ufo's and i'm just not doing that so
[55:55.800 --> 55:58.760]  no that's what and again most of them are led by
[55:58.760 --> 56:02.760]  disinfo agents the effect that's come out in the 60s and 70s that's the last
[56:02.760 --> 56:05.720]  thing we have declassified that they went out and
[56:05.720 --> 56:09.400]  tried to get groups to say kooky things then they've got like mentally ill
[56:09.400 --> 56:12.520]  weak-minded people who actually think they're fighting for good
[56:12.520 --> 56:15.800]  who try to make it anti-semitic anti-catholic uh
[56:15.800 --> 56:19.960]  you know ufo you know again they mix that in
[56:19.960 --> 56:23.800]  exactly and i what i did was i just took a part out of what's this great book
[56:23.800 --> 56:28.600]  out of chaos about this ufo hoax and i just converted into an article
[56:28.600 --> 56:31.720]  you know explaining how the rockefellows funded how hollywood
[56:31.720 --> 56:35.880]  is um is steering this whole thing so um
[56:35.880 --> 56:40.360]  we have um so many people asking me you know we we really want you know alex
[56:40.360 --> 56:44.040]  jones movies on dvd in german and i said well
[56:44.040 --> 56:48.200]  i just gotta ask you when we make this happen because we got the dubs we got
[56:48.200 --> 56:52.040]  it all basically lined up so not much left to do
[56:52.040 --> 56:55.880]  well here's the problem uh terror storm and in game
[56:55.880 --> 56:59.480]  we're put out through gary badley's company the one that put out out foxed
[56:59.480 --> 57:04.280]  and so i think you probably you know want to talk to me or him about that
[57:04.280 --> 57:06.840]  and normally i just say do whatever you want because i just want to get them out
[57:06.840 --> 57:09.960]  the problem is when you want to put stuff in stores you've got to like sign
[57:09.960 --> 57:13.240]  agreements with people that are going to put them in stores that's what i figured
[57:13.240 --> 57:16.920]  uh so what you need to do is you need to email erin at info wars dot com i think
[57:16.920 --> 57:19.480]  we've talked before i think i even know your website
[57:19.480 --> 57:23.640]  is it uh info creek that's right info creek dot tv
[57:23.640 --> 57:27.000]  yeah so i mean whatever if it's not some huge operation i don't care if it's out
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.800]  on dvd and other languages i don't care if it's out on the internet and other
[57:29.800 --> 57:33.880]  languages like i want it to be uh i just can't verbally tell you on air yeah go
[57:33.880 --> 57:36.600]  ahead and do whatever you want because then i've got other people that are in
[57:36.600 --> 57:40.040]  consideration that's why my other films i may not even
[57:40.040 --> 57:43.240]  put them in stores just so i have total control you know i mean i've done
[57:43.240 --> 57:47.080]  experiments i've tested things i've you know but i mean i mean there's
[57:47.080 --> 57:50.440]  everybody selling them on ebay everything else and i don't even go and block
[57:50.440 --> 57:54.040]  them even though i could shut them down even sites attacking me sell my stuff
[57:54.040 --> 57:57.960]  it's totally sick but i just let them because it's about getting the message
[57:57.960 --> 58:02.200]  out i would hope people would get the original high quality dvds from me
[58:02.200 --> 58:05.480]  we're hardly selling anything now because i never plug them uh but i'm just so
[58:05.480 --> 58:08.440]  busy yeah i mean we'd love to love to put out the german dvds
[58:08.440 --> 58:12.120]  sure pay you back of course and whatever i don't know whatever just just we'll

[1:00:27.240 --> 1:00:31.720]  give us the latest alex so um the story is a couple of weeks ago
[1:00:31.720 --> 1:00:36.200]  they named this guy claustrum Lincoln for tax evasion they had a warrant out for
[1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:39.800]  him so he was escorted by police you know to um
[1:00:39.800 --> 1:00:43.560]  to what place and and then everybody in alternative movement
[1:00:43.560 --> 1:00:46.600]  knew the name from the lists of the builder bird meetings
[1:00:46.600 --> 1:00:49.960]  from the last couple of years and we said man this guy is this guy is not
[1:00:49.960 --> 1:00:54.120]  just some kind of you know big wig he's really a powerful member of the
[1:00:54.120 --> 1:00:57.400]  builder bird group he was um the head of the
[1:00:57.400 --> 1:01:03.560]  german postal service he was um um i think head of the board of the german
[1:01:03.560 --> 1:01:07.240]  telecom and he was um on the board of directors of the
[1:01:07.240 --> 1:01:09.960]  alliance insurance company which by the way
[1:01:09.960 --> 1:01:13.320]  has not only a very very fascinating nazi past
[1:01:13.320 --> 1:01:16.760]  you know ensuring the death camps and and so on
[1:01:16.760 --> 1:01:21.160]  but the alliance insurance company also paid twice
[1:01:21.160 --> 1:01:24.760]  large sums of money to larry silvers that's right the government
[1:01:24.760 --> 1:01:31.080]  sponsor attack on 9 11 so interesting um interesting circle of people now
[1:01:31.080 --> 1:01:35.160]  and isn't it strange that spitzer was investigating that
[1:01:35.160 --> 1:01:39.080]  oh yeah and then he also goes down and it's just like i mean it was
[1:01:39.080 --> 1:01:42.920]  i mean they say it's a million euros i mean which is quite
[1:01:42.920 --> 1:01:46.520]  you know not a big sum for a guy like him but you know just with as with
[1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:49.640]  elliott spitzer they could have gotten him for bigger stuff i'm sure
[1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:54.920]  yeah that's 1.6 million us yeah well they always go they always burn
[1:01:54.920 --> 1:01:58.680]  their own people and you can believe you know you can be loading kids on a on a

[1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:05.560]  you know steds with them but yeah they always pick some small thing
[1:02:05.560 --> 1:02:09.320]  like a 1.6 million which sounds big to the peasantry
[1:02:09.320 --> 1:02:12.280]  um because they've always got a burner for something small
[1:02:12.280 --> 1:02:15.560]  that's compartmentalized that doesn't get into larger corruption that's why
[1:02:15.560 --> 1:02:19.240]  they went after clinton for sex with a intern
[1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:22.680]  uh instead of chinese generals in the white house

[1:08:16.520 --> 1:08:20.040]  erin actually pull up one of the articles he wrote about the people in
[1:08:20.040 --> 1:08:23.560]  bill berg involved now why are they so obsessed with texas
[1:08:23.560 --> 1:08:29.560]  ninth largest economy has uh... the most minerals of any state next to alaska
[1:08:29.560 --> 1:08:33.400]  it's number two behind alaska also in size geographically behind alaska our
[1:08:33.400 --> 1:08:36.680]  largest state and uh... all they gotta do is buy our
[1:08:36.680 --> 1:08:43.560]  legislature that's so corrupt that they steal votes on video camera
[1:08:43.560 --> 1:08:47.320]  by the way remember that uh... clip john we played a few months ago i don't
[1:08:47.320 --> 1:08:50.120]  remember the title of people don't believe me when i say that they just in front
[1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:53.160]  of news cameras just they'll go down the line when nobody's there just punching
[1:08:53.160 --> 1:08:56.440]  all the other people's votes of what like seven eight times
[1:08:56.440 --> 1:08:59.160]  they'll vote repeatedly over and over again the computers are all regular
[1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:02.120]  i mean is publicly evil publicly corrupt
[1:09:02.120 --> 1:09:05.640]  mhm but see they passed the laws where if they want to burn you they do
[1:09:05.640 --> 1:09:08.680]  erin briefly get into that place in the and the headline on the article he wrote
[1:09:08.680 --> 1:09:12.920]  what was six months ago uh... headline is al-qaeda bill de berg connection
[1:09:12.920 --> 1:09:16.360]  and uh... this txt buyout the largest buyout ever
[1:09:16.360 --> 1:09:19.800]  uh... which i think has now been scaled down but the point is
[1:09:19.800 --> 1:09:25.000]  this henry cravis rick perry deal led to these pakistani bankers from credit
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:30.920]  swiss and uh... and goldman sacks both bill de berg firms being indicted on
[1:09:30.920 --> 1:09:34.680]  dozens of charges and in the times of india reported
[1:09:34.680 --> 1:09:38.600]  that fb i investigators were looking into higher links which went all the way up
[1:09:38.600 --> 1:09:44.840]  to the prime minister of pakistan uh... shackat aziz who was former
[1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:48.920]  uh... chairman of city group for who's a city group for like thirty years
[1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:52.600]  that you know it's all western finance and there are a couple other high-level
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:57.240]  finance ministers of pakistan and they're in texas they love us bumpkins i mean
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:10:00.040]  they're just taking it all water districts power
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:02.520]  and they're all higher in their own private swat teams and if you don't
[1:10:02.520 --> 1:10:06.360]  like it they'll drop by not only was an insider investigation but it was also
[1:10:06.360 --> 1:10:10.520]  linked to al-qaeda money laundering quote unquote
[1:10:10.520 --> 1:10:15.000]  well where do you think they find their boys from yeah officially an open
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.720]  investigation but okay good job erin thanks
[1:10:17.720 --> 1:10:21.720]  appreciate you coming in uh... since i just talked about it
[1:10:21.720 --> 1:10:28.280]  it's about a six-minute clip what's the title of it so i'm giving people john
[1:10:28.280 --> 1:10:32.040]  since texas legislation and that's because they're trying to pass
[1:10:32.040 --> 1:10:36.040]  legislation we gotta show an id to vote
[1:10:36.040 --> 1:10:38.440]  well it's already that you've already got to come in and tell them the right
[1:10:38.440 --> 1:10:40.920]  address and the right precinct the right name
[1:10:40.920 --> 1:10:45.000]  i have trouble voting most of the time with these little gestapo officers
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:51.400]  the election fraud isn't with the voter fraud that is a very small problem
[1:10:51.400 --> 1:10:59.080]  badly coordinated negligible the problem is institutional fraud
[1:10:59.080 --> 1:11:03.720]  that's where it emanates from in fact with the new machines you can have as
[1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:06.440]  much voter fraud as you want it means nothing
[1:11:06.440 --> 1:11:09.480]  if you're like senator hagel who owns the electronic machine company that all
[1:11:09.480 --> 1:11:12.760]  the votes to cast on in in nebraska you win
[1:11:12.760 --> 1:11:15.960]  it doesn't matter what the poll show they just buy on the company and i win
[1:11:15.960 --> 1:11:19.240]  uh... if you don't like it i got swap teams they have automatic weapons shut
[1:11:19.240 --> 1:11:23.000]  up uh... let's go ahead and just play a few minutes of this
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:27.560]  relating to voter integrity some lawmakers are pushing for measures such
[1:11:27.560 --> 1:11:32.120]  as requiring voters to show a photo id before being allowed to cast a ballot
[1:11:32.120 --> 1:11:36.280]  another bill would criminalize anyone who delivers a ballot for someone unable
[1:11:36.280 --> 1:11:37.880]  to drive to the polls
[1:11:37.880 --> 1:11:41.000]  i was so much emphasis on one vote for one person
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:44.440]  you think lawmakers would make sure they follow the rules too
[1:11:44.440 --> 1:11:48.360]  and tonight cbs-42 investigates nancy wilson found out
[1:11:48.360 --> 1:11:54.200]  many don't think it's a record about clark plays read the bell
[1:11:54.200 --> 1:11:57.320]  this is state representative debbie riddle she authored the bill that would
[1:11:57.320 --> 1:12:01.400]  require voters to show a photo id clark bring the bell it's a record vote
[1:12:01.400 --> 1:12:06.120]  it's all about integrity record vote but the integrity of one person
[1:12:06.120 --> 1:12:08.600]  one vote doesn't apply at the legislature
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:12.840]  we found many lawmakers vote more than once
[1:12:12.840 --> 1:12:16.520]  take a look riddle votes turns around votes again for state rep
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:19.880]  kennel rewind and watch them in on the screen

[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:26.920]  elkins heads back to his desk but before he can vote joe crab turns around and
[1:12:26.920 --> 1:12:30.120]  beats him to it there is so much going on during the
[1:12:30.120 --> 1:12:34.040]  vote on the hpv vaccine mandate you really have to pay attention
[1:12:34.040 --> 1:12:38.040]  start with state rep hamilton at his desk leans over to vote a second time
[1:12:38.040 --> 1:12:41.640]  for his desk mate dan branch then reaches back to vote for charlie
[1:12:41.640 --> 1:12:44.840]  howard and cast a fourth vote for wane smith
[1:12:44.840 --> 1:12:49.240]  he's not the only one scrambling to vote rewind the video and take a look at
[1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:53.000]  the top of the screen state reps weston philips both lean over to vote for
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:57.400]  themselves and their desk mates philips votes a third time for christian

[1:13:51.320 --> 1:13:55.480]  and the rules of the house to vote for somebody else it doesn't matter

[1:14:41.320 --> 1:14:45.400]  three hundred dollars a piece in the legislature to go testify against the
[1:14:45.400 --> 1:14:48.600]  second amendment i said that's illegal and the guy didn't even care
[1:14:48.600 --> 1:14:53.480]  and the paper said i was bad for showing bribery
[1:14:55.960 --> 1:14:59.720]  i mean they just pay the cash out right in front of cameras
[1:14:59.720 --> 1:15:05.800]  cash triple voting laughing strutting around giggling

[1:15:14.040 --> 1:15:19.080]  disgusting meanwhile the general public thinks
[1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:24.520]  everything's fine has no idea what's even going on
[1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:32.280]  the truth is these guys are bored they want to put people in FEMA camps
[1:15:32.280 --> 1:15:36.200]  they want to take your businesses it's what they like to do
[1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:39.400]  you understand criminals
[1:15:39.400 --> 1:15:44.600]  if you study criminology the largest subgroup of criminals enjoy the
[1:15:44.600 --> 1:15:49.560]  excitement they like doing bad things you understand that
[1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:54.520]  and they've written laws where none of us can follow the law
[1:15:54.520 --> 1:16:02.600]  on your tax return one mistake one decibel in the wrong place
[1:16:02.600 --> 1:16:09.400]  is perjury is wire fraud is mail fraud

[1:16:34.200 --> 1:16:37.640]  i shouldn't be mean the point is they sent an innocent woman to jail because
[1:16:37.640 --> 1:16:41.400]  to the average idiot american a hundred million dollars is a lot of money
[1:16:41.400 --> 1:16:45.000]  and look people get mad i call everybody idiots i mean i've been an idiot

[1:18:49.560 --> 1:18:53.960]  it was an agreement but they bill it like oh we're doing it because they do it
[1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:59.160]  see how that works right um they also tried to do this back in 1986

[1:24:20.680 --> 1:24:23.720]  and by the way that listener who works for a pool company who did write up an
[1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:27.560]  article about the chlorine and how to kill fish
[1:24:27.560 --> 1:24:31.240]  what you put in your what you drink out of your tap has more chlorine on average
[1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:34.840]  than what's even in your pool we did post that on jonesreport.com
[1:24:34.840 --> 1:24:38.040]  i'm asking listeners who have expertise because i can tell when a listener calls
[1:24:38.040 --> 1:24:40.680]  in to say stuff that's accurate because i've researched it
[1:24:40.680 --> 1:24:44.120]  this listener robert your country needs you i don't have the money for the
[1:24:44.120 --> 1:24:47.720]  writers the people the infrastructure you want to write a simple article about
[1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:52.120]  you know the full story on the national id card the real id at your global id
[1:24:52.120 --> 1:24:55.400]  something like that we would post it on all the sites and just take the facts
[1:24:55.400 --> 1:24:59.800]  you're putting out and and and we would post that we and then
[1:24:59.800 --> 1:25:03.160]  hundreds of thousands would read it bare minimum we need
[1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:07.160]  intelligent people like you to help us and just send them to erin and info
[1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:11.560]  wars dot com send them to trade info wars dot com send them to paul
[1:25:11.560 --> 1:25:15.480]  send them to nemo we need your help listeners you've got the expertise i
[1:25:15.480 --> 1:25:17.640]  mean everything he's saying is the control grid
[1:25:17.640 --> 1:25:21.480]  and so you hear governor ridge lying about it sounding reasonable oh i'm just
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:24.840]  for a standardized driver's license not a real id
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:29.160]  not a not a national id card but you gotta have one to get on planes they
[1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:32.120]  say you gotta have one of the national parks to get on buses
[1:25:32.120 --> 1:25:35.160]  they admit it's a national id card in the bill
[1:25:35.160 --> 1:25:39.000]  i'll go ahead and finish up robert yeah the the real problem
[1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:42.280]  on the sides that being an international id card it's also that the
[1:25:42.280 --> 1:25:46.360]  biometrics are uh they don't really report the failure rates
[1:25:46.360 --> 1:25:49.480]  that um out of a hundred people 53 percent of it
[1:25:49.480 --> 1:25:53.560]  um was accurate and and so that means 45 47 percent of it
[1:25:53.560 --> 1:25:56.840]  is inaccurate but you got to be careful on that because
[1:25:56.840 --> 1:26:00.760]  six years ago they put face no seven years ago they put face scanning cameras
[1:26:00.760 --> 1:26:03.800]  in tampa and then they malfunctioned and they arrested and
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:06.680]  swat team thinking they had felonies innocent people eating
[1:26:06.680 --> 1:26:10.920]  you know a hot dog in downtown at a restaurant outside
[1:26:10.920 --> 1:26:14.120]  uh you know hundreds of cases and then they now have announced this year okay
[1:26:14.120 --> 1:26:17.320]  it's perfected it's a hundred percent so they make the debate
[1:26:17.320 --> 1:26:21.000]  about is it accurate instead of does this violate
[1:26:21.000 --> 1:26:25.000]  now your privacy but here's the bigger problem you go set up a bank account
[1:26:25.000 --> 1:26:27.880]  everybody's a secret police agent everybody's a tattle tale they're
[1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:30.680]  asking you questions they're they're real suspicious
[1:26:30.680 --> 1:26:35.240]  you're putting money in their dirty bank uh this is also so you can't run if
[1:26:35.240 --> 1:26:37.880]  you have a tyrannical government to any nation
[1:26:37.880 --> 1:26:40.920]  this is so you can't get away with any of your money
[1:26:40.920 --> 1:26:45.160]  uh the oecd and others have you know called for stopping quote
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:51.080]  tax shelters and tax avoidance countries and it's our nation pushing and
[1:26:51.080 --> 1:26:56.360]  leading the world towards this absolutely and and
[1:26:56.360 --> 1:27:00.040]  out here in california we've been um working within our legislator getting
[1:27:00.040 --> 1:27:03.240]  people to call their state assembly their state senators
[1:27:03.240 --> 1:27:07.160]  um we have a uh a assembly member uh passing
[1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:13.160]  trying to pass a j r 51 the nav is his name um where they either slow this down
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:17.000]  or stop it now i've heard a rumor and i don't know for a fact yet
[1:27:17.000 --> 1:27:21.480]  i haven't contacted all my sources that they're now having so many problems is
[1:27:21.480 --> 1:27:24.840]  with people calling up is that they're actually trying to roll this
[1:27:24.840 --> 1:27:30.840]  implementation implementation back 2009 2010 i heard about december
[1:27:30.840 --> 1:27:35.000]  2009 no it's been a public announcement by the government as a lie
[1:27:35.000 --> 1:27:38.840]  just like they say okay we're not going ahead with the trans texas corridor
[1:27:38.840 --> 1:27:41.560]  and then they put signs up everywhere and grab the roads
[1:27:41.560 --> 1:27:44.360]  where they say okay we're not putting toll roads on mopac and then they announce
[1:27:44.360 --> 1:27:47.400]  they are uh for austin i still know what i'm talking about
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:51.640]  that is a military psych warfare tactic it's already being implemented
[1:27:51.640 --> 1:27:55.800]  but then they tell you oh no now it's in 2010 that was announced by homeland
[1:27:55.800 --> 1:27:59.720]  security about four months ago okay and so that's
[1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:03.320]  that in a way that means we're having a fact but i mean that doesn't mean that
[1:28:03.320 --> 1:28:07.080]  we have to stop the battle we have to continue to push our local
[1:28:07.080 --> 1:28:11.640]  and state and federal people to actually but there's something deeper
[1:28:11.640 --> 1:28:14.760]  there's something deeper though if you really study it this is and you
[1:28:14.760 --> 1:28:18.520]  obviously the reason i'm finishing a sentence is folks is to show you
[1:28:18.520 --> 1:28:21.720]  because there are a lot of yuppies don't check out our facts but they do get
[1:28:21.720 --> 1:28:23.800]  impressed if we can finish each other's sentences
[1:28:23.800 --> 1:28:27.320]  because then they think oh it must be true so see i know you won't look into
[1:28:27.320 --> 1:28:29.560]  what i'm saying i wish you would and you'd find out it was true yuppies
[1:28:29.560 --> 1:28:32.200]  so i'll just finish his sentences and he'll finish mine because there's two
[1:28:32.200 --> 1:28:37.480]  people that know what's going on there's a deeper system to all of this and
[1:28:37.480 --> 1:28:42.200]  that is the feds are allowing this fight on purpose to create loopholes for the
[1:28:42.200 --> 1:28:45.800]  illegal aliens but then there will not be loopholes for citizens
[1:28:45.800 --> 1:28:49.800]  or first world travelers or emigres to and
[1:28:49.800 --> 1:28:56.600]  from the first world slave grid that will always be uploaded and updated
[1:28:56.600 --> 1:29:00.840]  first with the new uh...
[1:29:00.840 --> 1:29:06.920]  you know slave 1.5 1.6 1.7 the third world second world's behind that so
[1:29:06.920 --> 1:29:10.280]  really they're just taking our energy they're experts at jujitsu
[1:29:10.280 --> 1:29:14.600]  they also attack they also defend when we attack they repackage spin
[1:29:14.600 --> 1:29:18.120]  that's why they're in control and then they fire it back out and use our
[1:29:18.120 --> 1:29:21.160]  energy to only blast loopholes in the real id
[1:29:21.160 --> 1:29:24.680]  so the illegals aren't under it you understand that's why we got to kill
[1:29:24.680 --> 1:29:29.400]  real id totally because it's only for us i appreciate your call please do a

[1:31:57.560 --> 1:32:01.240]  acidic due to stress acidic diet and lack of exercise
[1:32:01.240 --> 1:32:04.680]  ph balance is the foundation of energy abundance and perfect health
[1:32:04.680 --> 1:32:08.600]  as well as prevention of disease people who alkalize the water they drink

[1:32:12.440 --> 1:32:16.520]  it was intended for human beings to drink alkaline water but due to modern way of
[1:32:16.520 --> 1:32:19.560]  life most people are overly acidic the fact is that
[1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:22.520]  disease simply cannot exist in an alkaline environment
[1:32:22.520 --> 1:32:26.120]  fat accumulates if a person consumes too much acid on a regular basis and

[1:33:41.400 --> 1:33:45.160]  realize how wicked governor ridge is denying it
[1:33:45.160 --> 1:33:49.000]  oh i'm against a national ID card but i like standardized driver's license
[1:33:49.000 --> 1:33:53.160]  and it's already international under trading
[1:33:53.160 --> 1:33:57.240]  let's go ahead and talk to rocko in kinetic at rocko you're on the air
[1:33:57.240 --> 1:34:01.560]  hey alex how you doing i wanted to thank you uh for all your hard work if i
[1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:04.200]  this country truly has a guardian angel you're it
[1:34:04.200 --> 1:34:08.600]  oh well we're in trouble then well we need somebody to look out for a
[1:34:08.600 --> 1:34:12.520]  huddled masses and i can't think of a better guide in you
[1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:17.400]  so you're number one in my book anyhow what i want to talk to you about is um
[1:34:17.400 --> 1:34:21.080]  you know this uh reverend uh you know rocko
[1:34:21.080 --> 1:34:25.240]  obama uh has been uh in the news lately and he talks
[1:34:25.240 --> 1:34:27.880]  about you know government creating aids he made this
[1:34:27.880 --> 1:34:31.000]  you know outlander government government created the age documented
[1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:35.400]  government ships in the drugs documented right but you know of course you know
[1:34:35.400 --> 1:34:39.880]  was received by the people of america in a manner which uh
[1:34:39.880 --> 1:34:43.560]  you know i think it was the messenger more than the message
[1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:46.760]  and well it's the media it's the media spin
[1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:50.600]  and then those truths of government shipping in drugs and age
[1:34:50.600 --> 1:34:54.280]  was wrapped in basically white men are the devil and that's
[1:34:54.280 --> 1:34:58.120]  i mean the guy is a racist and uh but frankly i get to the point where i
[1:34:58.120 --> 1:35:01.400]  can't even blame black folks who have that attitude
[1:35:01.400 --> 1:35:04.920]  that it's just not sophisticated enough just like the general public isn't to
[1:35:04.920 --> 1:35:08.520]  see the big picture and then whites buy into it and think they're part of the
[1:35:08.520 --> 1:35:12.200]  white establishment when they're not now i don't know the guy from a hole in a
[1:35:12.200 --> 1:35:16.040]  wall i've never met him but you know i kind of thought of you on this issue
[1:35:16.040 --> 1:35:19.880]  because when i did research whether there was any truth to it a guy came up
[1:35:19.880 --> 1:35:22.920]  by the name of boyd graves without him on clint
[1:35:22.920 --> 1:35:26.680]  and he claims to the patent five six nine seven seven
[1:35:26.680 --> 1:35:29.960]  and i don't know the first thing about you know looking up patents and whether
[1:35:29.960 --> 1:35:33.320]  or not there's any truth no no it's there and it did it was developed
[1:35:33.320 --> 1:35:37.560]  uh there's a navy patent that there was a congressional funding for it
[1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:42.280]  uh in the late 70s and we have u n documents and others about auto immune
[1:35:42.280 --> 1:35:46.280]  diseases and soft kill weapons there's there's no doubt it's engineered sir
[1:35:46.280 --> 1:35:49.800]  now there's patent even work i mean you know why is it that you know this guy
[1:35:49.800 --> 1:35:52.920]  would make a claim that there's a cure i don't know i'm not talking about him
[1:35:52.920 --> 1:35:58.120]  saying a cure patent i'm talking about the the the military patented aids
[1:35:58.120 --> 1:36:01.560]  they just didn't call it aids that's not the cure patent that he's talking about
[1:36:01.560 --> 1:36:04.600]  yeah you know i've had graves on there's a lot of experts saying the government
[1:36:04.600 --> 1:36:08.040]  created aids there's a lot of evidence to it and there's a lot of
[1:36:08.040 --> 1:36:11.160]  he doesn't say aids when you go find the military patents of the military
[1:36:11.160 --> 1:36:14.840]  develop it says auto immune weapon and then it describes it
[1:36:14.840 --> 1:36:18.360]  i mean the numbers are staggering on aids and if the government created aids i
[1:36:18.360 --> 1:36:22.440]  mean that makes the the the holocaust and what the chinese did
[1:36:22.440 --> 1:36:26.520]  with 25 30 million dead look like a walk in a park we're talking 800 million
[1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:29.480]  people here where you go with this i gotta move on in a minute rock up
[1:36:29.480 --> 1:36:32.520]  well you know where i'm going basically with this is that you know i'm
[1:36:32.520 --> 1:36:35.320]  surprised that we're not really addressing this issue a little more
[1:36:35.320 --> 1:36:38.280]  because i think that you know if the government did in fact create aids and
[1:36:38.280 --> 1:36:42.600]  we do have the stage front and center now with you know barack obama in a
[1:36:42.600 --> 1:36:46.040]  limelight being he's a leading candidate in a presidential election
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:50.440]  why not run with this and you know find out if there is in fact any legitimacy
[1:36:50.440 --> 1:36:53.240]  from this who people in the scientific community of people actually could look
[1:36:53.240 --> 1:36:56.440]  at these things and prove that this is you know for real
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:36:59.800]  now i hear you and i crave talking about i hear you and i appreciate your call
[1:36:59.800 --> 1:37:03.640]  i've had boy graves on i think he's a nice guy but it doesn't
[1:37:03.640 --> 1:37:06.440]  he doesn't he doesn't come off too well i'm just gonna leave it at that his
[1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:10.760]  info is good uh but it he comes off strange
[1:37:10.760 --> 1:37:14.680]  so everybody keeps talking about boy graves uh lin Horowitz has done amazing
[1:37:14.680 --> 1:37:19.400]  research on this with the source research
[1:37:19.400 --> 1:37:24.680]  dr lin Horowitz but let me just go back uh my dad you know had a lot of friends
[1:37:24.680 --> 1:37:27.960]  in the medical field because he's a physician in dallas growing up
[1:37:27.960 --> 1:37:31.720]  and i remember in the mid eighties talking about aids and my dad saying oh
[1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:35.960]  that's an engineered weapon uh it's race specific
[1:37:35.960 --> 1:37:39.880]  that's what he'd basically been told by medical doctors epidemiologists
[1:37:39.880 --> 1:37:45.400]  in dallas in the mid eighties i remember thinking oh more crazy stuff for my dad
[1:37:45.400 --> 1:37:48.520]  just like my dad said don't when i went when i was 16 and went to get my
[1:37:48.520 --> 1:37:51.800]  driver's license he said don't sign the organ donor card
[1:37:51.800 --> 1:37:57.320]  hospitals uh don't resuscitate you uh they withhold care if you're young and
[1:37:57.320 --> 1:38:00.920]  healthy because they make about 400 grand that was back then off your organs
[1:38:00.920 --> 1:38:04.440]  and i thought oh sure but i didn't i did what he said and later it came out on
[1:38:04.440 --> 1:38:06.440]  60 minutes they kill you for your organs
[1:38:06.440 --> 1:38:12.360]  they've been caught in a bunch of hospitals yeah absolutely the bioethics
[1:38:12.360 --> 1:38:17.480]  board has directives uh just and it's all done right above board
[1:38:17.480 --> 1:38:21.320]  uh so he said that then and if i try to get into
[1:38:21.320 --> 1:38:23.880]  this it would take to see this is the problem the scholar just brought up a
[1:38:23.880 --> 1:38:27.960]  huge issue and i love how we like spin the wheel and some incredibly important
[1:38:27.960 --> 1:38:31.800]  issue comes up each time we take a call
[1:38:31.800 --> 1:38:35.000]  i should do whole shows on that i've probably done 20 30 shows i don't know
[1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:40.040]  over the years on it but um here's what we know
[1:38:40.040 --> 1:38:43.320]  we know from us studies that if you take blacks
[1:38:43.320 --> 1:38:47.640]  comparatively the whites who have just as many sexual partners in some cases
[1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:50.440]  the same sexual partners they've done studies
[1:38:50.440 --> 1:38:54.920]  where let's say a black woman has hiv
[1:38:54.920 --> 1:38:58.280]  and there is a black partner having sex with her and a white partner having
[1:38:58.280 --> 1:39:02.600]  sex with her uh it is hundreds of times harder
[1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:08.040]  for a white person to contract AIDS there are countries in africa where 40
[1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:14.520]  plus percent of the population has hiv there have been bbc reports admitting
[1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:17.800]  that the that international groups have done studies going
[1:39:17.800 --> 1:39:21.400]  we looked at hundreds of young girls and boys who've never had sex they've
[1:39:21.400 --> 1:39:24.440]  medically examined they've never had blood transfusions
[1:39:24.440 --> 1:39:28.680]  their parents don't even have AIDS but they have hiv and they've had to admit
[1:39:28.680 --> 1:39:32.120]  it has to be the inoculations but they spun it and said
[1:39:32.120 --> 1:39:39.240]  they must be using the same needle over and over and over and over again
[1:39:39.240 --> 1:39:42.840]  no it's in the polio shots they've been caught
[1:39:42.840 --> 1:39:46.040]  uh it came out in government documents that as a test group
[1:39:46.040 --> 1:39:49.240]  in in new york they used the homosexual community
[1:39:49.240 --> 1:39:53.240]  because the males were having hundreds of sexual partners a month
[1:39:53.240 --> 1:39:59.240]  and this was the 70s they were delivering large volume of blood product
[1:39:59.240 --> 1:40:03.800]  into areas of the body not designed to come in contact with those fluids
[1:40:03.800 --> 1:40:08.600]  and i want to get into details here folks and it was a perfect vector
[1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:12.840]  so they were the vector uh to put it out and then now
[1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:16.440]  they've been trained to want to vector i'm not saying all of them but
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:20.360]  cover rolling stone it's admitted ron paul's not bad to talk about it
[1:40:20.360 --> 1:40:24.280]  uh you know you shouldn't want AIDS folks and you shouldn't want to spread it
[1:40:24.280 --> 1:40:26.920]  and you shouldn't want to give the gift by donating blood that's another trick
[1:40:26.920 --> 1:40:31.160]  that's come out this is a death cult and it's just a fact
[1:40:31.160 --> 1:40:36.840]  i don't want you to die i don't hate you uh just you're killing yourself
[1:40:36.840 --> 1:40:40.120]  and we have i mean this is in roda tyranny
[1:40:40.120 --> 1:40:47.000]  this is in in game but but see if this is in game one when i make in game two
[1:40:47.000 --> 1:40:50.360]  which i may call in game two or i may just call it
[1:40:50.360 --> 1:40:57.560]  a 2012 film about 2012 did you show you the real 2012 how it's being orchestrated
[1:40:57.560 --> 1:41:00.680]  and i'm not saying anything's gonna happen in 2012 i'm saying
[1:41:00.680 --> 1:41:06.360]  that they're that they're using that as a touchstone date
[1:41:06.360 --> 1:41:10.200]  but the globalist
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:14.600]  think tanks a hundred years ago 80 years ago 70 years ago 50 years ago 40
[1:41:14.600 --> 1:41:19.640]  years ago 20 years ago a year ago said they can't wait till obolos
[1:41:19.640 --> 1:41:23.160]  airborne it needs to be engineered to kill 90 percent of us and they wrote
[1:41:23.160 --> 1:41:28.200]  books saying we could have an autoimmune virus in the 30s
[1:41:28.680 --> 1:41:32.680]  see they just shelve all that research and this could wipe out the blacks i mean
[1:41:32.680 --> 1:41:39.800]  the publicly written make a whole film kim trails all of it's going to be in it
[1:41:42.600 --> 1:41:46.040]  by the way most people don't talk about what their film our ideas are
[1:41:46.040 --> 1:41:49.080]  i could get killed next week god forbid this isn't about me being the
[1:41:49.080 --> 1:41:52.120]  filmmaker i hope you rip me off and go make this film
[1:41:52.120 --> 1:41:55.480]  listeners out there so you didn't about that it's about
[1:41:55.480 --> 1:41:59.560]  warning people and stopping the murder
[1:41:59.560 --> 1:42:04.440]  in fact i ought to just tell you my whole film idea just lay it out and post it
[1:42:04.440 --> 1:42:07.000]  and hope you do it of course then they'd say it was
[1:42:07.000 --> 1:42:10.840]  their film back at me but it doesn't matter i wouldn't even care
[1:42:10.840 --> 1:42:13.720]  because i just raced to try to make these and i have to finish each one as i'm
[1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:16.680]  going i don't know i make a 9-11 truth film it's
[1:42:16.680 --> 1:42:19.880]  really dynamic it's cinema verite just a show i can do that with no
[1:42:19.880 --> 1:42:22.440]  voiceover and then i'm also making a jfk cinema
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:25.800]  verite and i'm trying to finish those by the end of the year so i can get on to
[1:42:25.800 --> 1:42:30.200]  this end of days documentary
[1:42:30.200 --> 1:42:33.720]  and usually a second film isn't as powerful as the first this is going to
[1:42:33.720 --> 1:42:38.360]  blow the first in game away but it's a foundation
[1:42:38.360 --> 1:42:43.320]  this is an education but to get into all the evidence of aids being
[1:42:43.320 --> 1:42:45.800]  engineered
[1:42:48.600 --> 1:42:51.800]  it's such an important subject i hate to even get into it without properly
[1:42:51.800 --> 1:42:56.520]  laying it out but it is i mean they'll go into
[1:42:56.520 --> 1:43:00.120]  areas of pakistan they'll go into areas of afghanistan
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:04.200]  they'll go into areas of africa latin america where no one has polio and i
[1:43:04.200 --> 1:43:08.040]  see this every week in the news every week i see it
[1:43:08.040 --> 1:43:11.480]  and they will come in and now they have to have the police who are paid the
[1:43:11.480 --> 1:43:15.400]  military will block off the town no one can leave and they will come in they
[1:43:15.400 --> 1:43:19.160]  forcibly inject them in india for in the government's getting the money so they
[1:43:19.160 --> 1:43:23.480]  do it they forcibly inject them in peru they forcibly inject them
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:27.480]  in central africa and the people now run
[1:43:27.480 --> 1:43:31.000]  for decades i mean that they run
[1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:35.400]  no one has polio they shoot them up everybody gets polio
[1:43:35.400 --> 1:43:38.840]  hundreds of children die the un ships in
[1:43:38.840 --> 1:43:45.160]  millions of leaders of a pre-packed uh baby formula all the children die that
[1:43:45.160 --> 1:43:49.320]  eat it i mean it's type it in
[1:43:49.320 --> 1:43:52.600]  type baby formula mass deaths africa i mean it's just
[1:43:52.600 --> 1:43:57.240]  it's just unbelievable bill gates has given
[1:43:57.240 --> 1:44:03.560]  what their foundation is like 80 billion now plus with warren buffett
[1:44:03.560 --> 1:44:07.320]  all for eugenics his dad runs Planned Parenthood but you hear on the news
[1:44:07.320 --> 1:44:11.320]  bill gates helping blacks he loves them
[1:44:11.320 --> 1:44:18.440]  oh man now here
[1:44:18.600 --> 1:44:22.840]  the soft kills had some blowback but but not a lot
[1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:25.720]  but it's well known in medical circles and with epidemiologists and
[1:44:25.720 --> 1:44:29.640]  virologists that if you're a white person you've got to have a
[1:44:29.640 --> 1:44:33.960]  compromised immune system normally from using dirty methamphetamine or other
[1:44:33.960 --> 1:44:37.640]  drugs that are filled with toxins because
[1:44:37.640 --> 1:44:41.160]  they can't get the raw materials to make methamphetamine and
[1:44:41.160 --> 1:44:44.840]  ecstasy and things anymore which are clean they have to take four or five
[1:44:44.840 --> 1:44:49.080]  other chemicals each to mix it up to get just one of the precursors and so you
[1:44:49.080 --> 1:44:52.760]  have hundreds of things mixed in generally by the end of it
[1:44:52.760 --> 1:44:56.920]  hundreds of different chemicals in each mixture and then you get heavy metals
[1:44:56.920 --> 1:45:03.160]  toxins poisons uh and so you know your teeth are loose
[1:45:03.160 --> 1:45:07.240]  and falling out you got black circles around your eyes you're totally crazy
[1:45:07.240 --> 1:45:11.800]  you're snorting the methamphetamine and then now you get
[1:45:11.800 --> 1:45:15.800]  over the month you know a gallon of blood product pumped into you
[1:45:15.800 --> 1:45:19.800]  and i'm just going to call it blood product that's what it is
[1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:25.240]  and your body can't fight it and it gets you but if you're black and you get
[1:45:25.240 --> 1:45:29.400]  one AIDS virus you're dead doornail
[1:45:30.040 --> 1:45:34.440]  and that's why there's confusion people go oh you can beat AIDS you can beat HIV
[1:45:34.440 --> 1:45:39.160]  you can yeah if you're white and you get back to being really healthy and
[1:45:39.160 --> 1:45:42.600]  like Tommy Morrison and all these other people and you get off the drugs and
[1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:45.880]  things a lot of times you can live 20 30 years or your magic johnson
[1:45:45.880 --> 1:45:49.320]  you're an elitist you agree to go be a spokesman for AIDS they're going to
[1:45:49.320 --> 1:45:55.720]  give you the cure he just says i no longer have it
[1:45:55.720 --> 1:46:01.960]  see they're led into the higher level of it and of course they have cures for it
[1:46:01.960 --> 1:46:07.320]  AIDS isn't even AIDS it from the evidence it's a cover
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:10.440]  see any black op is like this it has multiple projects
[1:46:10.440 --> 1:46:14.840]  are hidden under its umbrella a huge bio weapons testing program
[1:46:14.840 --> 1:46:17.800]  and see a lot of microbiologists found this out in the last eight years
[1:46:17.800 --> 1:46:21.240]  that's why they've killed over 300 of them
[1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:26.600]  you start publishing reports about this and you've actually got the
[1:46:26.600 --> 1:46:29.640]  credentials you're going to get run over by a van or
[1:46:29.640 --> 1:46:32.760]  thieves are going to break in your house and steal everything and of course
[1:46:32.760 --> 1:46:34.760]  they're going to torture you to death to find out who else knows
[1:46:34.760 --> 1:46:37.160]  it's always the same they're tortured to death in their house and they go we
[1:46:37.160 --> 1:46:39.960]  don't know why the guys that stole the stereo
[1:46:39.960 --> 1:46:43.560]  tortured the doctor to death the virologist was tied down and appeared
[1:46:43.560 --> 1:46:46.920]  tortured for more than 10 hours
[1:46:48.200 --> 1:46:53.720]  but the devil cult then urinated on him and cut a pentagram in his chest
[1:46:53.720 --> 1:46:56.520]  by the way the last time i talked about that i saw a message board saying i was
[1:46:56.520 --> 1:46:59.640]  lying that was in virginia that was in the news
[1:46:59.640 --> 1:47:03.000]  and that they had deaths all over the country from maggots
[1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:08.200]  entering the brain there's a particular type of fly not your standard
[1:47:08.200 --> 1:47:12.280]  just it's called a what what a screw fly i saw some guy on a youtube message
[1:47:12.280 --> 1:47:16.040]  board saying i was lying about that last night
[1:47:16.040 --> 1:47:19.320]  ten thousand dollars you call here right now i bet you i'll i'll take your
[1:47:19.320 --> 1:47:23.000]  money okay that was in the kansas city starring a bunch of other papers
[1:47:23.000 --> 1:47:29.560]  don't you say i'm a liar i'm sick of it you don't know what you're talking about

[1:48:28.200 --> 1:48:32.680]  did not time to call back uh two hours later i'm over at my
[1:48:32.680 --> 1:48:38.120]  girlfriend's house uh and for the first time in my life i saw black helicopter

[1:48:55.720 --> 1:48:58.760]  just like you heard the texas corrections officer talk about how all
[1:48:58.760 --> 1:49:03.240]  citizens have secretly been given a prisoner i d number
[1:49:03.240 --> 1:49:08.200]  i i wouldn't doubt it it's all part of a military op
[1:49:08.200 --> 1:49:11.640]  yeah they're uh solidifying their control
[1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:15.000]  uh the same people that have been uh patiently
[1:49:15.000 --> 1:49:18.360]  um dealing with what used to be our sovereignty since
[1:49:18.360 --> 1:49:22.120]  the uh sherman anti-trust act failed in the late 19th century
[1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:26.840]  we haven't been sovereign since then i mean it's it's been going on and uh i
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:31.560]  only learned since listening to you actually i did despite the fact that i
[1:49:31.560 --> 1:49:36.280]  have a university degree in history uh spent a couple years in law school uh
[1:49:36.280 --> 1:49:40.920]  i was completely brainwashed and there is nobody
[1:49:40.920 --> 1:49:44.760]  uh out there that's telling the truth like you are and a few other people
[1:49:44.760 --> 1:49:48.760]  and uh god bless you that you gotta you gotta
[1:49:48.760 --> 1:49:53.480]  stay alive long enough to get to get enough people out there to to keep
[1:49:53.480 --> 1:49:57.320]  keep uh keep the word going um it's just unbelievable
[1:49:57.320 --> 1:50:01.320]  uh when i hear you screaming sometimes i'm i'm i'm
[1:50:01.320 --> 1:50:05.000]  screaming in the uh the same way i was one of the first
[1:50:05.000 --> 1:50:08.680]  brainwashed members of the all volunteer army uh i don't know if you
[1:50:08.680 --> 1:50:12.520]  remember about uh three years ago or so uh
[1:50:12.520 --> 1:50:18.440]  1975 there we yeah uh i joined uh in um
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:21.320]  i really don't want to get into detail well that doesn't mean you're bad
[1:50:21.320 --> 1:50:24.120]  if you made it make make you remember the abc uh
[1:50:24.120 --> 1:50:27.400]  especially did on the old all volunteer army which people were
[1:50:27.400 --> 1:50:31.800]  then uh then apprehensive about rightly so because that you read the
[1:50:31.800 --> 1:50:35.720]  um uh notes of the constitutional convention the one thing that all the
[1:50:35.720 --> 1:50:39.800]  delegates all agreed on uh was no standing army so here we are ever
[1:50:39.800 --> 1:50:43.480]  since Lincoln with a standing army uh but now we got worse than that we have
[1:50:43.480 --> 1:50:46.840]  a mercenary army that's what it's publicly being turned into now
[1:50:46.840 --> 1:50:51.880]  there are 300 000 mercs in my wreck our beloved republic is on her
[1:50:51.880 --> 1:50:55.320]  knees the forces of globalism are destroying national sovereignty

[2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:40.520]  really want to thank you for your unselfish contributions man
[2:00:40.520 --> 2:00:47.000]  uh i saw um and uh 9-11 road to tyranny on a public access station
[2:00:47.000 --> 2:00:50.920]  uh probably about seven years ago and uh when i saw the movie i
[2:00:50.920 --> 2:00:54.440]  i you know at the end of watching the movie i just thought to myself wow
[2:00:54.440 --> 2:00:59.560]  everything i always thought was true is true and uh yeah you know it in your gut
[2:00:59.560 --> 2:01:03.000]  yeah so i've been listening to you ever since look your gut just like when
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:05.560]  you're walking down a street at night and you feel something
[2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:08.600]  turning around and somebody's looking at you yeah or just like when you're in the
[2:01:08.600 --> 2:01:12.520]  woods mental nowhere and you never see anybody on the land in 10 years and
[2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:15.720]  all of a sudden somebody's trespassing and you feel them a hundred yards away
[2:01:15.720 --> 2:01:19.960]  your gut knows the truth exactly hey listen alex i'm a little bit concerned
[2:01:19.960 --> 2:01:24.520]  man um you constantly uh are sitting here having to spend a lot of your time
[2:01:25.480 --> 2:01:29.160]  justifying what you say and all that and i'm just curious i mean uh
[2:01:29.160 --> 2:01:33.240]  when uh walter cronkite reported a story or uh
[2:01:33.240 --> 2:01:39.000]  uh dan rather i mean did they have to uh to go out and uh you know uh
[2:01:39.000 --> 2:01:43.800]  sit here and uh defend their story you know for the next 48 hours or the next
[2:01:43.800 --> 2:01:48.680]  week or so i mean i don't get it um well i do that because there are people
[2:01:48.680 --> 2:01:51.880]  pre-programmed with pre-programmed responses
[2:01:51.880 --> 2:01:56.840]  driving around in their cars and so i then want to back it up and give them
[2:01:56.840 --> 2:02:02.280]  examples and then almost counter how i know they're
[2:02:02.280 --> 2:02:06.600]  going to be pre-programmed understand let me ask you this i mean i mean our i
[2:02:06.600 --> 2:02:10.840]  mean i know i took a hot shower this morning so if anything i'm saying uh
[2:02:10.840 --> 2:02:13.480]  doesn't make sense um it's probably because i'm dumbed down from the
[2:02:13.480 --> 2:02:18.520]  fluoride but uh i don't want to ask you is i mean do people actually think that
[2:02:18.520 --> 2:02:23.080]  you would say something on your radio show that you couldn't back up
[2:02:23.080 --> 2:02:26.600]  i mean well i mean they're not in the real world and i appreciate your call
[2:02:26.600 --> 2:02:29.800]  and and i'm gonna love all your calls i'm gonna move quick here so i can get to
[2:02:29.800 --> 2:02:33.720]  everybody i'm just gonna be be brief about this
[2:02:33.720 --> 2:02:37.240]  when i say dying core was caught running child kidnapping rings it was in the
[2:02:37.240 --> 2:02:40.680]  chicago tribune bbc
[2:02:41.560 --> 2:02:45.640]  when i say any of this stuff if i tell you that they signed a treaty to make it a
[2:02:45.640 --> 2:02:49.480]  world id i mean i remember it was in the newspaper
[2:02:49.480 --> 2:02:54.360]  so yes uh we do tell the truth here but people have trouble believing it or
[2:02:54.360 --> 2:03:00.920]  they're upset by what i say so they go through mental gymnastics to deny it
[2:03:00.920 --> 2:03:05.720]  and so i just remind them at your peril continue to deny what i'm saying
[2:03:05.720 --> 2:03:11.080]  madden kentucky you're on the air hey alex uh i just wanted to thank you and
[2:03:11.080 --> 2:03:15.160]  erin for posting that video on bill clinton yesterday
[2:03:15.160 --> 2:03:20.280]  sure made my day another confrontation bill clinton confronted again
[2:03:20.280 --> 2:03:25.400]  yeah that was me that's maccasie i went in there and uh got in good
[2:03:25.400 --> 2:03:30.040]  well tell folks what happened well i got my press pass and ran up there there
[2:03:30.040 --> 2:03:33.400]  was a massive line there must have been two thousand people waiting to
[2:03:33.400 --> 2:03:36.040]  just i mean you wouldn't believe it it would you would have thought it was
[2:03:36.040 --> 2:03:39.960]  absolute royalty coming people there were women who fainted when he came on
[2:03:39.960 --> 2:03:43.720]  stage it was completely ridiculous and over the top
[2:03:43.720 --> 2:03:48.200]  and i'd patiently waited for my turn and uh got a chance but the funny thing is
[2:03:48.200 --> 2:03:51.800]  the interesting thing they would not let the press
[2:03:51.800 --> 2:03:56.280]  film anywhere outside of the press box which is 50 feet away from the stage
[2:03:56.280 --> 2:03:59.080]  and they came up and told me i had to clear me with secret service and all
[2:03:59.080 --> 2:04:03.000]  that stuff and they told me no you cannot film outside here
[2:04:03.000 --> 2:04:06.600]  so when he was given autographs i went to go ask him a question
[2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:11.080]  and they came up and warned me again no questions no questions and no you can't
[2:04:11.080 --> 2:04:14.840]  film here well that might shatter the illusion you see these are all when
[2:04:14.840 --> 2:04:18.760]  cheney has a town hall or bush does they make you sign a pledge not to

[2:07:27.800 --> 2:07:31.400]  putting off emergency food preparations to celebrate the holidays
[2:07:31.400 --> 2:07:35.400]  will be the most dangerous decision that some of us will ever make

[2:09:56.600 --> 2:10:00.120]  going to talk to you chris um i just wanted to talk about
[2:10:00.120 --> 2:10:03.800]  um just how crazy it is up here in canada like
[2:10:03.800 --> 2:10:10.520]  we don't even realize here how quickly and fast the rfid chip is going on
[2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:14.200]  here in canada like for example uh... new
[2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:17.960]  uh... british columbia manitoba and the province i live in
[2:10:17.960 --> 2:10:21.880]  ontario already the new licenses are going to have this new
[2:10:21.880 --> 2:10:26.840]  rfid chip and then it's crazy and we only have 10 provinces you guys have 50
[2:10:26.840 --> 2:10:31.080]  states how fast this is moving across canada where it's all the same system
[2:10:31.080 --> 2:10:34.200]  in all the western world it's just happening by accident
[2:10:34.200 --> 2:10:37.560]  there's no rfid or governor rich earlier
[2:10:37.560 --> 2:10:43.480]  yeah that's not real well yeah i mean just the little coverage that
[2:10:43.480 --> 2:10:47.080]  here in canada is unbelievable like i didn't even know about it until i saw
[2:10:47.080 --> 2:10:50.840]  the new licenses and i said ontario got new licenses i heard the
[2:10:50.840 --> 2:10:54.360]  little two-minute blip that was under the federal idea you're going to thumb
[2:10:54.360 --> 2:10:57.640]  print face scanned every day at work everyone's
[2:10:57.640 --> 2:11:01.960]  clocked in they're gonna have a new sales tax with the income tax and then that
[2:11:01.960 --> 2:11:06.920]  will be the reason to track all cash purchases making us a casual society
[2:11:06.920 --> 2:11:10.280]  and then it's total control then the real fun can start
[2:11:10.280 --> 2:11:14.520]  yeah i just want to say thanks and i wish that i could find someone here in
[2:11:14.520 --> 2:11:18.440]  canada that has you know your values and stuff like that
[2:11:18.440 --> 2:11:21.880]  that has you know well people are brought up in a wonderland i think it's
[2:11:21.880 --> 2:11:25.640]  shopping malls movie theaters everything's friendly they believe the tv
[2:11:25.640 --> 2:11:28.040]  propaganda they don't know right under the surface
[2:11:28.040 --> 2:11:33.160]  is just completely rotten and it's because most people are good and decent
[2:11:33.160 --> 2:11:36.200]  and happy that they they think the rest of the world is like them they don't
[2:11:36.200 --> 2:11:38.920]  understand history but they're beginning to understand
[2:11:38.920 --> 2:11:42.920]  and remember a lot of people we planted seeds with aren't awake now
[2:11:42.920 --> 2:11:48.440]  but when they get bruised when they get squeezed our numbers will swell
[2:11:48.440 --> 2:11:51.960]  oh the new world orders and a lot of trouble my friend thank you chris
[2:11:51.960 --> 2:11:56.120]  timon ohio you're on the air worldwide

[2:12:12.840 --> 2:12:16.040]  the little bonus checks do you think they're going to try to make people as a
[2:12:16.040 --> 2:12:19.480]  beginning to scan for those checks and possibly
[2:12:19.480 --> 2:12:22.200]  thumb scan as well i think that's going to be the beginning of it
[2:12:22.200 --> 2:12:27.640]  it's all pavlovian i don't know
[2:12:28.840 --> 2:12:31.640]  and before you were earlier talking about your rants

[2:12:52.680 --> 2:12:56.440]  nature they know how to manipulate they create the red tape and the
[2:12:56.440 --> 2:13:00.440]  blob the blob the blob it's the blob and that's how the government the low
[2:13:00.440 --> 2:13:04.680]  level works but up top is that little robotic demon brain
[2:13:04.680 --> 2:13:07.960]  running the whole thing and just like jackie gleason said

[2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:02.680]  anything else from canada oh god a couple of days ago they were talking
[2:15:02.680 --> 2:15:07.880]  about age they want to start bringing people with age into canada you know
[2:15:07.880 --> 2:15:12.360]  isn't that lovely and then just a few days later i think it was yesterday
[2:15:12.360 --> 2:15:16.120]  this i heard the article about the states they want to stop people
[2:15:16.120 --> 2:15:19.320]  from coming into the states with with age so i thought
[2:15:19.320 --> 2:15:22.280]  i wonder if they're going to start stopping canada well they also i meant
[2:15:22.280 --> 2:15:26.760]  to cover this on monday but i forgot to uh the big age trials of the latest
[2:15:26.760 --> 2:15:31.720]  AIDS vaccine heard a bunch of people and so oh they're not going to be able to
[2:15:31.720 --> 2:15:35.240]  try to force this and and and the the HPV
[2:15:35.240 --> 2:15:38.200]  human papillomavirus vaccine which they admit doesn't even protect you and can
[2:15:38.200 --> 2:15:41.720]  double your chances of the cancer i love all these drugs
[2:15:41.720 --> 2:15:45.160]  you know this drug will kill you but you'll be able to sleep or this drug
[2:15:45.160 --> 2:15:49.880]  will give you cancer but just buy it and people oh gosh give it to me
[2:15:49.880 --> 2:15:55.320]  but they want to then claim it's mandated to take their AIDS vaccination
[2:15:55.320 --> 2:15:58.760]  and it it's but but it it hurt the people so bad that took it they can't
[2:15:58.760 --> 2:16:03.240]  even cover that up it wouldn't it be fun it was
[2:16:03.240 --> 2:16:06.200]  awesome if they start stopping canadians at the border
[2:16:06.200 --> 2:16:09.320]  and saying hey we know we want to just a blood test to make certain you don't
[2:16:09.320 --> 2:16:12.760]  have age you know and then they could could get into our blood
[2:16:12.760 --> 2:16:15.560]  you know who knows with their dirty needles but
[2:16:15.560 --> 2:16:19.400]  well i mean dirty needles it's not that they put it in there and then you
[2:16:19.400 --> 2:16:23.560]  prove that you got it from the shot they say oh it was a dirty needle
[2:16:23.560 --> 2:16:28.360]  but uh well i mean there's hundreds of different diseases that have been
[2:16:28.360 --> 2:16:33.080]  caused by vaccines you know the hv-40 the live cancer virus that's given tens of
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:39.000]  millions in the west cancer no i mean don't believe me type hv-40
[2:16:39.000 --> 2:16:42.040]  cancer virus into google you'll have hundreds and hundreds of mainstream
[2:16:42.040 --> 2:16:45.400]  articles about it i've been doing that you know for follow-up and get some
[2:16:45.400 --> 2:16:48.760]  printouts of the art meant the things you mentioned and what you say is true
[2:16:48.760 --> 2:16:52.520]  you know you're you're on you're not spinning because i have everything
[2:16:52.520 --> 2:16:56.360]  validated that you well i was on the cdc just last weekend
[2:16:56.360 --> 2:17:02.600]  and i'm going from memory but i believe it says 160 million americans were
[2:17:02.600 --> 2:17:06.680]  exposed through the polio oral and shot to the live
[2:17:06.680 --> 2:17:09.560]  cancer virus and admits it killed a bunch of people
[2:17:09.560 --> 2:17:12.680]  you know i'm just going to google that right now see my memory is not 100% all
[2:17:12.680 --> 2:17:16.600]  the time and and like i said i said that 14 people die
[2:17:16.600 --> 2:17:20.600]  year of sharks it was really 12 when i looked it up so my
[2:17:20.600 --> 2:17:24.120]  memory it's usually close but it's it's not what it used to be let me
[2:17:24.120 --> 2:17:30.040]  let me go ahead and just hhv 40 let me see hv
[2:17:30.040 --> 2:17:39.160]  40 and you put in her in and uh cdc i was on the cdc
[2:17:39.160 --> 2:17:43.400]  they got a bunch of propaganda about it but then they admit it
[2:17:43.400 --> 2:17:48.200]  oh see i'm not finding it right now
[2:17:48.520 --> 2:17:52.840]  but anything else that's all you know that's i mean there's a lot of things
[2:17:52.840 --> 2:17:57.080]  happening here we've got the the go the mexican issue here in case
[2:17:57.080 --> 2:18:01.160]  something odd with there's a woman her name is martin and she's
[2:18:01.160 --> 2:18:04.680]  canadian and she ended up going over to mexico and
[2:18:04.680 --> 2:18:08.840]  got involved with somebody and next thing you know he did something wrong
[2:18:08.840 --> 2:18:11.720]  and they've arrested her she's been in jail for two years
[2:18:11.720 --> 2:18:15.080]  the government up here will do nothing and it's just fishy
[2:18:15.080 --> 2:18:19.240]  that you're talking about this north american union and why is canada
[2:18:19.240 --> 2:18:24.280]  and in mexico at odds like this they seem to be creating something that's not
[2:18:24.280 --> 2:18:27.800]  necessary her name is her last name is martin and i just can't remember her
[2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:31.560]  first name but that is i don't know it rings bells or something off there you

[2:24:59.080 --> 2:25:04.120]  i'm on a different cdc page and i can't read i don't have time to read all of it
[2:25:04.120 --> 2:25:08.440]  but it talks about people being given it and tested army camps you know they're
[2:25:08.440 --> 2:25:12.840]  accidentally testing it on you at army camps giving you cancer viruses
[2:25:12.840 --> 2:25:17.240]  so you know 100 000 troops at this space and then it says
[2:25:17.240 --> 2:25:21.000]  well i just found the part it says who received the sv 40 contaminated polio
[2:25:21.000 --> 2:25:24.120]  vaccines and it says 98 million people were given the
[2:25:24.120 --> 2:25:29.560]  shots and then i'm having trouble finding that 160
[2:25:29.560 --> 2:25:32.040]  million but but again they kind of parse it out the
[2:25:32.040 --> 2:25:37.160]  different years so but anyways it's 98 million whatever
[2:25:37.160 --> 2:25:41.880]  uh but they gave the entire population the shots and and and the also the oral
[2:25:41.880 --> 2:25:45.640]  vaccines and then my local pediatrician told me how he was volunteering
[2:25:45.640 --> 2:25:48.360]  three years ago you were supposed to do that every year to give you some
[2:25:48.360 --> 2:25:52.760]  volunteer time i had a city clinic giving kids their
[2:25:52.760 --> 2:25:55.960]  vaccines that hadn't gotten them for school you know when they say go to the
[2:25:55.960 --> 2:25:59.560]  sports stadium or you'll be arrested you're truing there's no law but
[2:25:59.560 --> 2:26:01.640]  they tell her by that and the doctor's gonna do it
[2:26:01.640 --> 2:26:06.040]  he said yeah they were giving them oral sv 40
[2:26:06.040 --> 2:26:10.760]  uh and he said he looked at it and it was old vaccine from the 60s
[2:26:10.760 --> 2:26:16.680]  and that that that that that's illegal in the us but he said do not quote my name
[2:26:16.680 --> 2:26:20.760]  he said i thought you were nuts when i heard you talking about that
[2:26:20.760 --> 2:26:24.360]  what do you think look it's all about hurting you
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:28.200]  and the doctors don't know they think they're helping but see he knew enough
[2:26:28.200 --> 2:26:31.720]  to go wait a minute he was like what is going on he
[2:26:31.720 --> 2:26:36.760]  read the bottles he read the containers it was ancient
[2:26:36.760 --> 2:26:40.360]  by the way under international law they still ship
[2:26:40.360 --> 2:26:45.960]  that original stuff out of the third world you can't make this stuff up
[2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:50.200]  you cannot make it up they want you to die they want to kill you these are
[2:26:50.200 --> 2:26:54.200]  sickos did you hear about the big head of the ut biology
[2:26:54.200 --> 2:26:57.880]  section on climatology but he's separately a lizard expert
[2:26:57.880 --> 2:27:02.840]  saying he wants to kill 90 of us i mean that and he gets 95 standing ovations
[2:27:02.840 --> 2:27:06.120]  thousands in a room and at the texas academy of sciences getting an award he
[2:27:06.120 --> 2:27:10.040]  goes all over the world and they everyone's i will love you
[2:27:10.040 --> 2:27:13.640]  that's the news that of all those scientists
[2:27:13.640 --> 2:27:19.000]  about five percent the papers reported didn't stand
[2:27:19.000 --> 2:27:23.000]  i mean they would just start hoping and yelling he'd show big screenshots of
[2:27:23.000 --> 2:27:26.920]  skulls on a wall and say that mass death will soon
[2:27:26.920 --> 2:27:29.400]  begin
[2:27:30.280 --> 2:27:33.960]  by the way he's on his own university website dressed up like a druid
[2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:38.520]  next to his with a with a wizard staff next to his
[2:27:38.520 --> 2:27:42.360]  bull buffalo named lucifer i mean these people are all the same
[2:27:42.360 --> 2:27:46.840]  they're completely out of their minds

[2:28:05.800 --> 2:28:09.320]  hi alex one of the true reasons that i have found
[2:28:09.320 --> 2:28:14.120]  being a somewhat of an old-timer is that when i hear something
[2:28:14.120 --> 2:28:16.760]  whether it's on the local news or whatever
[2:28:16.760 --> 2:28:19.480]  i i i can tell sometimes whether it's true or not
[2:28:19.480 --> 2:28:22.520]  you know what i became aware of that there was deception
[2:28:22.520 --> 2:28:25.560]  was what i would try to compare it with something i had heard maybe twenty or
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:29.480]  thirty years ago that i knew to be true like what happens during inflation
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:32.520]  you know i i heard remembered from nineteen eighty what happened there
[2:28:32.520 --> 2:28:36.680]  and then you can tell it's a lie but young people don't have that
[2:28:36.680 --> 2:28:41.160]  uh... advantage they don't they don't know what happened in the past
[2:28:41.160 --> 2:28:44.840]  and therefore they don't have anything to compare the lies to
[2:28:44.840 --> 2:28:49.000]  and uh... in one area that i i have noticed almost everybody has no
[2:28:49.000 --> 2:28:52.680]  knowledge of is the fact that a person isn't supposed to be
[2:28:52.680 --> 2:28:56.360]  sick and then take medicine and have diseases all the time that a person is
[2:28:56.360 --> 2:28:59.320]  supposed to be healthy and the main way you do that is by
[2:28:59.320 --> 2:29:04.040]  eating right and that but nobody knows what nobody knows how to do that nobody
[2:29:04.040 --> 2:29:07.720]  knows what good food really is because they're being lied to
[2:29:07.720 --> 2:29:11.240]  nineteen the nineteen seventies for instance they found out the trans
[2:29:11.240 --> 2:29:14.760]  um... scientists found out the trans fat were uh...
[2:29:14.760 --> 2:29:17.640]  uh... were not good for you they were very harmful for you you know you're a
[2:29:17.640 --> 2:29:21.080]  great caller and i hope you'll call back tomorrow the next day and i'll
[2:29:21.080 --> 2:29:23.960]  give you five minutes or so because i got a guest coming up
[2:29:23.960 --> 2:29:27.720]  because i really want to hear you talk about this issue
[2:29:27.720 --> 2:29:31.160]  but but as dumb as the new general or as ignorant as the new generation is
[2:29:31.160 --> 2:29:35.160]  imagine you know what the old timers knew that we didn't see change you see

[2:32:42.280 --> 2:32:49.080]  unregulated tv on your pc go to www.orderfreetv.com
[2:32:50.360 --> 2:32:53.720]  but i don't understand why can't howard stern make fun of george bush when rush
[2:32:53.720 --> 2:32:57.640]  limbaugh is allowed to say things like the iraqi prison scandals no worse
[2:32:57.640 --> 2:33:02.280]  than what happens in college frat house hazings all across america
[2:33:02.280 --> 2:33:05.080]  that just makes me think that rush limbaugh is still
[2:33:05.080 --> 2:33:10.440]  high rush limbaugh is doing a lot of drugs too
[2:33:10.440 --> 2:33:15.160]  he did a lot of drugs rush limbaugh did so many drugs
[2:33:15.160 --> 2:33:24.120]  courtney love would say you know what i can't i got to work tomorrow
[2:33:24.120 --> 2:33:27.480]  but rush limbaugh never had to face any of the courts of the courtney had to
[2:33:27.480 --> 2:33:30.360]  deal with he never had to worry about any of that he just got to go back to
[2:33:30.360 --> 2:33:34.600]  work i mean have drug laws changed a lot recently because it wasn't too long
[2:33:34.600 --> 2:33:37.880]  ago that they sent tommy chong behind bars for
[2:33:37.880 --> 2:33:42.120]  selling bongs on the internet like who didn't know
[2:33:42.120 --> 2:33:45.960]  tommy chong smoked weed
[2:33:46.760 --> 2:33:53.080]  it's on the sat people should not be put behind bars
[2:33:53.080 --> 2:33:57.800]  for smoking pot i mean pot smokers can't commit crime
[2:33:57.800 --> 2:34:02.760]  folks they can barely that's why we uh got uh margaret show on she's one of the
[2:34:02.760 --> 2:34:06.280]  top comedians of the country she starred in a bunch of movies the stars the
[2:34:06.280 --> 2:34:10.120]  major sitcoms for decades and she just gets bigger and
[2:34:10.120 --> 2:34:13.320]  bigger and she really tells it like it is on so many
[2:34:13.320 --> 2:34:16.360]  so many issues you know the new film america drug war coming out
[2:34:16.360 --> 2:34:20.040]  next month it just aired on uh show time we're gonna have it on dvd for you
[2:34:20.040 --> 2:34:22.680]  that i consulted on my buddy kevin both they went into jail in the interview
[2:34:22.680 --> 2:34:26.120]  tommy when he was in there in california and he talked about how he smoked pot
[2:34:26.120 --> 2:34:28.840]  with arnie but arnie isn't gonna get in trouble
[2:34:28.840 --> 2:34:32.120]  how just months before he got busted he was smoking pot with arnie
[2:34:32.120 --> 2:34:38.040]  it's all selectively enforced and and limbaugh could take a hundred he went
[2:34:38.040 --> 2:34:41.320]  deaf from it that'd kill like five horses by the way
[2:34:41.320 --> 2:34:44.200]  a hundred oxy cottons a day it's it's synthetic heroin
[2:34:44.200 --> 2:34:47.880]  but you're selling bongs to smoke weed that george washington smoked
[2:34:47.880 --> 2:34:51.480]  you're gonna go to jail for a couple years and so we are really on and that a
[2:34:51.480 --> 2:34:56.120]  whole bunch of issues uh is margaret show and her website is margaret show
[2:34:56.120 --> 2:34:58.280]  dot com we have a link to it up on info wars
[2:34:58.280 --> 2:35:02.920]  dot com margaret thanks for coming on with us thank you i didn't know that
[2:35:02.920 --> 2:35:06.520]  tommy smoked weed with arnell that sounds great
[2:35:06.520 --> 2:35:09.960]  yeah well we actually have the video that it's in the film
[2:35:09.960 --> 2:35:15.560]  it's now aired on just that that is just so insane that he had to go to prison
[2:35:15.560 --> 2:35:19.880]  for that you know i mean it's just ludicrous that there are so many laws
[2:35:19.880 --> 2:35:24.280]  against marijuana when marijuana is hardly a problem at all that the big
[2:35:24.280 --> 2:35:28.680]  problem that you know that the country is totally ignoring other problems i mean
[2:35:28.680 --> 2:35:32.760]  alcohol is far worse than any kind of like pot that anybody would smoke
[2:35:32.760 --> 2:35:36.520]  i think well they can find no deaths from pot and by the way i don't smoke it
[2:35:36.520 --> 2:35:41.240]  uh but they can find over a hundred thousand a year related to alcohol
[2:35:41.240 --> 2:35:45.000]  right and and um nicotine is a terrible drug as well
[2:35:45.000 --> 2:35:48.680]  and i think that those substances like alcohol and nicotine need to be
[2:35:48.680 --> 2:35:51.560]  regulated far more than anything like marijuana which
[2:35:51.560 --> 2:35:55.320]  i find really helps people so i don't understand
[2:35:55.320 --> 2:35:59.240]  well it does for hundreds of illnesses glaucoma cancer patients you name it
[2:35:59.240 --> 2:36:01.800]  i mean i'm just getting into the drug war first and we'll just get into what's
[2:36:01.800 --> 2:36:04.040]  important to you right now what you're really focused on and where your career
[2:36:04.040 --> 2:36:07.320]  is going some of the new stuff you've done some of your concert movies there's
[2:36:07.320 --> 2:36:10.760]  there's so much to talk about and the 20 minutes we've got you but
[2:36:10.760 --> 2:36:15.560]  the larger you know issue of limbaugh i mean he is such a hypocrite that he can
[2:36:15.560 --> 2:36:19.560]  you know be gobbling uh close to a thousand pills a week
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:23.720]  and committing felonies doing it with narcotics but that's okay
[2:36:23.720 --> 2:36:28.440]  and he still calls for the cocaine laws where you have a blacks caught with
[2:36:28.440 --> 2:36:33.480]  a crack they get 20 years in prison but a white lawyer gets probation
[2:36:33.480 --> 2:36:37.640]  right i mean it's obviously very racist and very hypocritical and
[2:36:37.640 --> 2:36:41.720]  and because he's a conservative he gets away with a lot more than anybody else
[2:36:41.720 --> 2:36:45.320]  does because of his politics i think more than just being a quote
[2:36:45.320 --> 2:36:49.800]  conservative he supports the military industrial prison complex
[2:36:49.800 --> 2:36:54.120]  right right it's a shame it's really a shame
[2:36:54.120 --> 2:36:58.840]  you know you've been from the from the first days of this administration when
[2:36:58.840 --> 2:37:02.280]  really people weren't criticizing lord bush when he had a 90%
[2:37:02.280 --> 2:37:05.640]  improvement you were criticizing him now everybody's criticizing we have the
[2:37:05.640 --> 2:37:10.360]  10 steps to fascism Naomi wolf uh even conservative pot answer saying bush is
[2:37:10.360 --> 2:37:14.360]  insane he's talking about being a dictator i give us your take on when
[2:37:14.360 --> 2:37:17.560]  you started really getting concerned about bush
[2:37:17.560 --> 2:37:22.040]  well i got concerned right after 9 11 where um you know the plane hit the
[2:37:22.040 --> 2:37:27.160]  world trade center and he was in that classroom with all those children
[2:37:27.160 --> 2:37:30.680]  and they told him what was going on and he did nothing
[2:37:30.680 --> 2:37:35.480]  for several minutes he did nothing as he waited as we waited and waited and
[2:37:35.480 --> 2:37:38.840]  waited for him to do something fifteen minutes the country was in danger and
[2:37:38.840 --> 2:37:41.880]  he did nothing we were attacked for the first time on american soil and we did
[2:37:41.880 --> 2:37:45.800]  he did nothing that's when i realized that there was
[2:37:45.800 --> 2:37:51.080]  something wrong very very wrong now a lot of the victims families and others
[2:37:51.080 --> 2:37:54.440]  and willy nelson and charlie sheen and the former german defense minister and
[2:37:54.440 --> 2:37:58.200]  the former italian president and thousands of architects and
[2:37:58.200 --> 2:38:01.400]  engineers have said that especially building seven not hit by a plane
[2:38:01.400 --> 2:38:04.840]  collapsing perfectly they have questions and now it turns out that bush
[2:38:04.840 --> 2:38:08.760]  appointed the commission and had zealocow his his deputy running it do you
[2:38:08.760 --> 2:38:11.480]  have any questions about the official story
[2:38:11.480 --> 2:38:15.640]  well i have a lot of questions about the pentagon i mean i don't understand
[2:38:15.640 --> 2:38:21.400]  why we have so much footage of the world trade center
[2:38:21.400 --> 2:38:25.160]  and the sort of the the the buildings falling between towers falling and why
[2:38:25.160 --> 2:38:28.360]  there is also this whole thing that happened at the pentagon
[2:38:28.360 --> 2:38:32.680]  which in a sense if you hit the pentagon it's far more of a security breach if
[2:38:32.680 --> 2:38:35.560]  you're talking about national security i mean
[2:38:35.560 --> 2:38:38.840]  that is in a sense a lot worse of course there's a lot of fatalities
[2:38:38.840 --> 2:38:42.840]  a lot more with the the the towers towers but the pentagon
[2:38:42.840 --> 2:38:46.360]  they we sort of glossed over that we don't see a lot of information about that
[2:38:46.360 --> 2:38:50.280]  and we don't even have a clear picture of the damage or what happened
[2:38:50.280 --> 2:38:53.240]  and to me that's troubling like why is that
[2:38:53.240 --> 2:38:58.280]  so under the rug why are we not seeing anything about that why is it all
[2:38:58.280 --> 2:39:00.840]  focused on the towers i mean i understand
[2:39:00.840 --> 2:39:04.680]  that the tragedy has sort of a you know the ground zero that that is sort of
[2:39:04.680 --> 2:39:08.520]  the ground zero of the tragedy but there was other parts to it too that day
[2:39:08.520 --> 2:39:11.320]  was a terrible day and there was other things that happened
[2:39:11.320 --> 2:39:14.920]  why are they not focusing on that and where are they hiding
[2:39:14.920 --> 2:39:19.160]  you know it is suspicious that there's that 16-foot hole before it collapses
[2:39:19.160 --> 2:39:23.320]  and and they seized all the video camera tapes i mean i wonder why they
[2:39:23.320 --> 2:39:26.200]  won't release any of those i mean they release one from a
[2:39:26.200 --> 2:39:30.360]  from a parking can that only takes a picture every second or so and it just
[2:39:30.360 --> 2:39:34.200]  shows it doesn't show a plane it's very weird
[2:39:34.200 --> 2:39:37.800]  right in the pentagon is it really where so much of our
[2:39:37.800 --> 2:39:41.000]  you know so much of our government is really housed there's so much things
[2:39:41.000 --> 2:39:44.600]  but so many like military security all of our top secret stuff happens there
[2:39:44.600 --> 2:39:48.520]  so of course it's going to be monitored from every angle every second and yet we
[2:39:48.520 --> 2:39:51.880]  have no footage of it it's very mysterious and
[2:39:51.880 --> 2:39:55.320]  so i don't i i always i've always been curious about that like what's up with
[2:39:55.320 --> 2:39:59.240]  the pentagon where where and what happened there and where's the damage
[2:39:59.240 --> 2:40:04.760]  and what what occurred and and why uh was it almost not as bad
[2:40:04.760 --> 2:40:07.960]  as what happened in the towers why is it not as
[2:40:07.960 --> 2:40:11.400]  um what happened it's just very strange to me
[2:40:11.400 --> 2:40:15.160]  yeah you would think of a plane could bring down not just the two buildings
[2:40:15.160 --> 2:40:18.040]  but one down the street that wasn't hit by anything
[2:40:18.040 --> 2:40:21.320]  uh just magically boy you think of a plane at the pentagon the whole thing
[2:40:21.320 --> 2:40:25.240]  would have just blown up right and just a little piece of it seemed to sort of
[2:40:25.240 --> 2:40:28.200]  like have fallen over like somebody drove a car into it or something but it
[2:40:28.200 --> 2:40:31.640]  was a it was a whole plane and then where's the plane it's so weird i don't
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:35.800]  know well what about very much about a conspiracy to me i think
[2:40:35.800 --> 2:40:39.000]  very much about a conspiracy well well what about uh
[2:40:39.000 --> 2:40:42.920]  the i mean you're very well informed politically i've seen that
[2:40:42.920 --> 2:40:46.280]  the peanut documents were dick cheney publicly wrote that we need a big
[2:40:46.280 --> 2:40:50.120]  catalyzing event to be able to launch all these wars and then and then bush
[2:40:50.120 --> 2:40:54.840]  massed 44 000 us troops in the country surrounding afghanistan and had two
[2:40:54.840 --> 2:40:58.760]  carriers there and they sent over 18 000 british troops and he signed the
[2:40:58.760 --> 2:41:03.160]  launch order the day before 9 11 to attack afghanistan but then he said
[2:41:03.160 --> 2:41:06.680]  he attacked afghanistan because they were supposedly behind the attacks
[2:41:06.680 --> 2:41:09.800]  boy i mean you i mean you just don't mass those troops overnight
[2:41:09.800 --> 2:41:14.200]  that was a four-month buildup margaret i know and they were ready for something
[2:41:14.200 --> 2:41:17.400]  they were ready to go so it was all some kind of a plan and
[2:41:17.400 --> 2:41:21.000]  really i mean our country is no stranger to conspiracy
[2:41:21.000 --> 2:41:24.280]  anything i mean this whole country was built on conspiracy there's all
[2:41:24.280 --> 2:41:29.640]  conspiracy in every major political event always something going on and so
[2:41:29.640 --> 2:41:32.680]  then when this one is uncovered it's going to be major and and people are
[2:41:32.680 --> 2:41:37.000]  going to be very angry i think people are already angry anyway because
[2:41:37.000 --> 2:41:41.000]  the country has fallen apart just because of the bush administration and it's
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:43.800]  really terrible you know why people are stuff
[2:41:43.800 --> 2:41:46.520]  yeah that's why people are so excited about coming in out and voting in the
[2:41:46.520 --> 2:41:49.800]  next election and getting so involved because they really they can't stand it
[2:41:49.800 --> 2:41:53.640]  anymore well i have to say that both political parties
[2:41:53.640 --> 2:41:58.360]  are very corrupt and bad but i am seeing a lot of attacks on barack obama by
[2:41:58.360 --> 2:42:03.720]  the establishment and that that uh... that is very suspicious
[2:42:03.720 --> 2:42:08.520]  it is very suspicious and a lot of the kinds of attacks the kinds of
[2:42:08.520 --> 2:42:12.600]  saying like when you know associating him with this reverend right or
[2:42:12.600 --> 2:42:16.840]  saying trying to make it seem like his point of view is the same as reverend
[2:42:16.840 --> 2:42:20.040]  right point of view and um... really when you look at
[2:42:20.040 --> 2:42:24.120]  um... john mccain spiritual advisor is a sort of minister who's
[2:42:24.120 --> 2:42:29.320]  his his his you know speeches are very very extreme as well like he's talking
[2:42:29.320 --> 2:42:32.760]  about how abortion is kind of a black genocide and all the stuff well he says
[2:42:32.760 --> 2:42:35.080]  he wants world war he says he wants right though
[2:42:35.080 --> 2:42:39.800]  he says he wants world war three right uh... but but you know and yet that's
[2:42:39.800 --> 2:42:43.320]  not being brought up by the mainstream media because
[2:42:43.320 --> 2:42:46.840]  that isn't at panel i think i suppose or i don't know that's being suppressed
[2:42:46.840 --> 2:42:50.760]  well at mccain's age about uh... in fact i looked the numbers up this morning
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:55.080]  more than seventy percent of the time you have a relapse within a decade or even
[2:42:55.080 --> 2:42:58.920]  sooner and die of lymphoma alone he's had him and that's the bad kind of your
[2:42:58.920 --> 2:43:02.840]  lymph nodes he's had all sorts of cancer and he's seventy one the oldest person
[2:43:02.840 --> 2:43:07.320]  ever run uh... and he's working and he starts singing songs about bomb bomb
[2:43:07.320 --> 2:43:11.480]  bomb bomb Iran and then meanwhile he says i ran as al-qaeda when there's she
[2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:15.400]  i the opposite group i know it's crazy
[2:43:15.400 --> 2:43:19.880]  it's so misinformed and yet you know people are looking at him like he's some
[2:43:19.880 --> 2:43:22.680]  kind of the answer but he's not he's just a continuation
[2:43:22.680 --> 2:43:26.440]  of the bush administration also he's another another leg of it and it's not
[2:43:26.440 --> 2:43:31.960]  it's just it's not right i another big tv actor danielson jada from rescue me
[2:43:31.960 --> 2:43:35.560]  has gone public saying he believes it's an inside job willy nelson on this show
[2:43:35.560 --> 2:43:39.720]  uh... danielson jada of course uh... charlie sheen but but
[2:43:39.720 --> 2:43:43.000]  uh... german defense ministers on this show number three in blairs government
[2:43:43.000 --> 2:43:46.760]  on this radio show i mean so many prominent people it's in the tens of
[2:43:46.760 --> 2:43:51.480]  thousands now uh... former cia section chief bill christiansen
[2:43:51.480 --> 2:43:55.400]  bob bear the movie syrian is about saying all the evidence as inside job
[2:43:55.400 --> 2:43:57.640]  bill dole the head of the biggest victims family
[2:43:57.640 --> 2:44:02.040]  has said he believes it's an inside job uh... i mean i agree with you that it's
[2:44:02.040 --> 2:44:05.240]  going to come out and i don't think they can stop this margaret
[2:44:05.240 --> 2:44:08.840]  i don't think so either and i think that the way that they're kind of trying to
[2:44:08.840 --> 2:44:11.880]  keep it from coming out is trying to keep somebody like mccain in office of
[2:44:11.880 --> 2:44:13.880]  trying to put somebody like mccain in office then
[2:44:13.880 --> 2:44:17.400]  and keep people like barack obama or hitler hillary clinton's out of it you
[2:44:17.400 --> 2:44:18.600]  know it's pretty
[2:44:18.600 --> 2:44:20.520]  pretty freaky
[2:44:20.520 --> 2:44:25.080]  well hillary's definitely in bed with the same people that pull bush's strings
[2:44:25.080 --> 2:44:29.800]  but i'll say that boat obama i'm seeing signs that he may not be that he may not
[2:44:29.800 --> 2:44:31.400]  be under their control
[2:44:31.400 --> 2:44:34.200]  i'll say that i mean i've really looked at it i mean all the dirty tricks are i
[2:44:34.200 --> 2:44:36.160]  mean i agree with his preacher
[2:44:36.160 --> 2:44:39.560]  that age was engineered i've got documents on that and i agree that
[2:44:39.560 --> 2:44:42.080]  the government's business in the cover of a squire and
[2:44:42.080 --> 2:44:46.160]  rolling stone they've been caught shipping drugs in i mean what is i mean
[2:44:46.160 --> 2:44:48.800]  he's just saying something we all know
[2:44:48.800 --> 2:44:52.160]  exactly but he's saying things that people are really afraid to hear which is
[2:44:52.160 --> 2:44:55.200]  why there's all this press around it and why it's being fun
[2:44:55.200 --> 2:44:58.080]  and somehow negative and really it's the truth and it's something that the
[2:44:58.080 --> 2:44:58.880]  establishment
[2:44:58.880 --> 2:45:01.680]  doesn't want you to know it's something that people in fox news don't want you
[2:45:01.680 --> 2:45:02.480]  to know
[2:45:02.480 --> 2:45:04.800]  or we don't want you to think it's true they would rather you think that he's
[2:45:04.800 --> 2:45:08.160]  some kind of crackpot when he's really not
[2:45:08.160 --> 2:45:12.240]  well brock obama certainly not a crackpot very charismatic very intelligent
[2:45:12.240 --> 2:45:14.160]  but he's got some really
[2:45:14.160 --> 2:45:16.800]  scary advisers like brzezinski huh
[2:45:16.800 --> 2:45:20.720]  but the big new brzezinski i think it's hard i think it's hard because he has
[2:45:20.720 --> 2:45:24.080]  he's i mean brock obama is great i'm actually campaign target
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:26.240]  for him and i don't know that he is
[2:45:26.240 --> 2:45:30.000]  yeah i just started doing that and i never have ever bought back the candidate
[2:45:30.000 --> 2:45:30.800]  before
[2:45:30.800 --> 2:45:34.960]  but i feel that he's really the only person out there
[2:45:34.960 --> 2:45:38.080]  that you can trust other than i actually really like that if you think it's too
[2:45:38.080 --> 2:45:39.280]  but he's not running
[2:45:39.280 --> 2:45:43.600]  yeah we've had him on you can't have that if you can't have somebody you know
[2:45:43.600 --> 2:45:46.560]  but we like brock obama what do you think iran paul because they tried the
[2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:49.600]  same demonization of him that was false
[2:45:49.600 --> 2:45:52.800]  i like ron paul too i just think that um
[2:45:52.800 --> 2:45:57.360]  for i'm looking about the way that you have to vote nowadays i think it's
[2:45:57.360 --> 2:45:59.040]  really who's going to get
[2:45:59.040 --> 2:46:00.000]  the person
[2:46:00.000 --> 2:46:05.040]  you hate out so you're not necessarily voting for who you want to vote for
[2:46:05.040 --> 2:46:08.560]  you're voting for who you who do you think who can who can beat who
[2:46:08.560 --> 2:46:11.440]  well i've always said i'm against rock obama can beat the mccain
[2:46:11.440 --> 2:46:15.280]  well well i've always i agree hillary will will might lose to him
[2:46:15.280 --> 2:46:19.600]  uh that that that i've never believed in lesser of two evils but in this case
[2:46:19.600 --> 2:46:22.800]  it's not even a lesser of two evils it's it's just
[2:46:22.800 --> 2:46:27.040]  it's it's incredible i mean
[2:46:27.040 --> 2:46:30.800]  hillary and mccain in my view are so bad
[2:46:30.800 --> 2:46:34.000]  i mean hillary really is a congenital liar she was just saying that she was
[2:46:34.000 --> 2:46:37.040]  they all they tried to shoot her plane down in bosnia and it turned out it's
[2:46:37.040 --> 2:46:39.440]  not i mean it's just i've really had enough of the
[2:46:39.440 --> 2:46:43.520]  clintons that's all i'm saying right well i just feel that we need to change
[2:46:43.520 --> 2:46:46.160]  completely i mean i think that there's just
[2:46:46.160 --> 2:46:49.440]  there's sort of like a kind of incestuousness of
[2:46:49.440 --> 2:46:53.200]  of of on capitol hill there's kind of an incestuousness in the white house
[2:46:53.200 --> 2:46:55.840]  there's sort of sort of like thing where it just keeps
[2:46:55.840 --> 2:47:01.760]  regenerating the same sort of thing and we need a complete change
[2:47:01.760 --> 2:47:06.080]  we're talking to margaret show on the top comedians film actors tv

[2:47:39.200 --> 2:47:42.240]  the things you're doing what's most important right now
[2:47:42.240 --> 2:47:45.680]  well i love doing stand-up comedy keeps me out there and keeps me connected with
[2:47:45.680 --> 2:47:49.040]  people and i i really enjoy it and it's a lot of fun
[2:47:49.040 --> 2:47:54.320]  so that's what my main passion is and uh... how much longer is that tour

[2:48:04.800 --> 2:48:09.120]  to city near you uh... at some point through this year
[2:48:09.120 --> 2:48:12.160]  other issues we haven't talked about in the eight nine minutes we've got left
[2:48:12.160 --> 2:48:15.920]  margaret uh... what what else is on your mind what else is concerning you
[2:48:15.920 --> 2:48:20.640]  right now because bush to me is has has has built up this huge police state
[2:48:20.640 --> 2:48:24.080]  system and then i don't see any evidence of it being dismantled
[2:48:24.080 --> 2:48:27.600]  regardless of who gets into office does that concern you and then what else
[2:48:27.600 --> 2:48:31.280]  concerns you well i'm concerned also about how
[2:48:31.280 --> 2:48:34.400]  we're going to get out of iraq because i think that this is really
[2:48:34.400 --> 2:48:37.360]  this is this war is so much based on a lie and
[2:48:37.360 --> 2:48:41.840]  and we've gotta stop sending children over there to fight this needless war i
[2:48:41.840 --> 2:48:45.440]  mean we've already destroyed our reputation around the world because of
[2:48:45.440 --> 2:48:48.080]  this war and it's really terrible and you know i'm
[2:48:48.080 --> 2:48:50.800]  out on the road all the time and i see these kids
[2:48:50.800 --> 2:48:54.000]  coming back from iraq or going to iraq and
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:56.640]  they are too young they are so young i mean if you
[2:48:56.640 --> 2:49:00.400]  i think if people really understood how young these soldiers are if they
[2:49:00.400 --> 2:49:02.560]  really looked at their faces and they could see
[2:49:02.560 --> 2:49:06.160]  that these kids are they're just children they're babies really
[2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:09.120]  they're babies and it you know makes me cry because
[2:49:09.120 --> 2:49:14.160]  it's like they're fighting a war that they shouldn't be fighting it's a it's
[2:49:14.160 --> 2:49:18.960]  a misuse of these their lives they're such
[2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:23.120]  they're they're such young kids i mean i don't believe in a war anyway but
[2:49:23.120 --> 2:49:26.080]  certainly not one that's based on a lie and certainly not one
[2:49:26.080 --> 2:49:29.840]  for this administration and it's really it's a shameful thing
[2:49:29.840 --> 2:49:33.040]  for 4 000 children to have died because of this
[2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:37.040]  it's a shameful shameful thing and i i don't know how this country can make it
[2:49:37.040 --> 2:49:40.560]  up to them well i know this it is true the barack obama is the only one that
[2:49:40.560 --> 2:49:42.320]  voted against the war and he has
[2:49:42.320 --> 2:49:47.440]  the i mean no one can can no one else can say that
[2:49:47.440 --> 2:49:50.880]  right and that's really important that's a really important thing to remember
[2:49:50.880 --> 2:49:53.360]  is that he was against it from the start i think
[2:49:53.360 --> 2:49:57.200]  you know it's also because the people who are going over there are people of
[2:49:57.200 --> 2:50:00.880]  color they are people without money they're they're
[2:50:00.880 --> 2:50:04.800]  lower classes they're they're they're people who are looking to
[2:50:04.800 --> 2:50:07.840]  the armed forces to help them fund their education
[2:50:07.840 --> 2:50:11.120]  and it's really it's really a shame it's really how
[2:50:11.120 --> 2:50:14.560]  this country really savages the poor and it really
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:18.000]  prostitutes the poor and it's terrible and so
[2:50:18.000 --> 2:50:21.040]  that's something that i need to see and i mean that that to me is a very
[2:50:21.040 --> 2:50:25.360]  emotional cause margaret show uh one of the top

[2:54:28.720 --> 2:54:32.000]  into 911 i mean how obvious is it not just the
[2:54:32.000 --> 2:54:36.240]  evidence of it being an inside job but then how they used it and how they took
[2:54:36.240 --> 2:54:39.840]  our freedoms and how they said you can't question us and if we're toxic
[2:54:39.840 --> 2:54:42.720]  waste dumping you can't report on it now because
[2:54:42.720 --> 2:54:46.320]  that'll help al-qaeda last week when it was they found drugs and all the major
[2:54:46.320 --> 2:54:50.720]  water supplies our local paper in austin said oh we're being told not to report
[2:54:50.720 --> 2:54:53.760]  on it what was in our water because it might help al-qaeda
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:54:58.240]  i mean it's just a catchall for corruption any comments on that
[2:54:58.240 --> 2:55:03.280]  oh it is a catchall it's just it's just insane and it's really upsetting you
[2:55:03.280 --> 2:55:06.160]  know and the way that it's affected travel and how
[2:55:06.160 --> 2:55:10.080]  you know they just look through your bags or they try to like make you put all
[2:55:10.080 --> 2:55:13.360]  your liquids in one place is like ridiculous because it's just
[2:55:13.360 --> 2:55:17.840]  they just want this this atmosphere of terror
[2:55:17.840 --> 2:55:21.600]  to just pervade everything so it'll make us easily control it's training
[2:55:21.600 --> 2:55:25.200]  taking the shoes off boat i'm sorry go ahead
[2:55:25.200 --> 2:55:29.120]  so they'll make you make you take your shoes off and and that's to train you
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:35.120]  they know that something that ridiculous is about habitualizing you to the fear
[2:55:35.120 --> 2:55:38.640]  just habitualizing you to the fear that's exactly what it is and trying
[2:55:38.640 --> 2:55:43.360]  to make sure that you'll do what they say under the disguise of terrorism
[2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:46.960]  where it's really i mean you know and it's funny because
[2:55:46.960 --> 2:55:50.560]  um i'm friends with a lot of arab americans a lot of
[2:55:50.560 --> 2:55:55.600]  i'm in the belly dance community and so the majority of the people that i know
[2:55:55.600 --> 2:55:59.760]  are arab americans and they said after 9 11 they could not believe
[2:55:59.760 --> 2:56:04.320]  that al-qaeda pulled it off because al-qaeda the whole idea of Arabs being
[2:56:04.320 --> 2:56:08.960]  organized is totally ludicrous yeah they could never have done it and so
[2:56:08.960 --> 2:56:12.800]  that to me is very funny because like if you look at the history of like
[2:56:12.800 --> 2:56:18.080]  fatwa that you know um like the the author is an author in egypt who had a
[2:56:18.080 --> 2:56:21.120]  fatwa against him for something like 40 years
[2:56:21.120 --> 2:56:25.360]  and he he went to the same cafe every day at the same time
[2:56:25.360 --> 2:56:28.960]  every single day for 40 years and they never killed him he lived to be
[2:56:28.960 --> 2:56:32.320]  in his 90s well take Egypt against the fatwa against the whole time
[2:56:32.320 --> 2:56:34.720]  i mean take it i mean take Egypt against Israel
[2:56:34.720 --> 2:56:38.160]  i don't mean to be mean to Arabs but they're not you know militarily
[2:56:38.160 --> 2:56:41.680]  there's the they're they're brave fighters they're just something's lacking
[2:56:41.680 --> 2:56:44.880]  an organizational skill and these guys from caves
[2:56:44.880 --> 2:56:50.560]  magically did this yes it's very i mean it's really uh
[2:56:50.560 --> 2:56:55.360]  that demonizing some some sort of entity that we don't really know about that
[2:56:55.360 --> 2:56:58.240]  we don't really know about it and then and then um
[2:56:58.240 --> 2:57:03.200]  so it's the government or margaret's idea i'm sorry you said the government's
[2:57:03.200 --> 2:57:07.040]  pushing this idea this idea of us trying to
[2:57:07.040 --> 2:57:10.800]  fear something that doesn't even really exist well what about planes with 50
[2:57:10.800 --> 2:57:15.120]  60 people on each one and guys pull box cutters out in americans don't fight
[2:57:15.120 --> 2:57:19.120]  back i don't believe that i don't believe that at all
[2:57:19.120 --> 2:57:22.880]  i don't believe that at all i don't think that people would be that afraid
[2:57:22.880 --> 2:57:27.040]  that not to actually like do something to overpower them to do something i
[2:57:27.040 --> 2:57:30.400]  don't think that's possible i guarantee and i'm a pretty big guy if i walked up
[2:57:30.400 --> 2:57:33.280]  to some group of men and pulled out a box cutter they'd beat the
[2:57:33.280 --> 2:57:37.200]  daylights out of me exactly i don't think that
[2:57:37.200 --> 2:57:42.320]  is that people face with the the idea that they may crash and behind a plane
[2:57:42.320 --> 2:57:46.720]  i don't think that they would do nothing well margaret show i appreciate
