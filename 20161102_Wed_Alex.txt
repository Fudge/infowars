[00:00.000 --> 00:23.880]  from the info wars dot com news center deep behind enemy lines in occupied texas broadcasting
[00:23.880 --> 00:29.880]  world wide you're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic
[00:29.880 --> 00:43.640]  technocracy tank over you're listening to alex jones in 1949 the central intelligence
[00:43.640 --> 00:48.720]  statement seen this was declassified 14 years ago put mouse a tongue in power he then killed
[00:48.720 --> 00:53.740]  80 plus million of his own people and the globalists from david rocker feller to present
[00:53.740 --> 00:58.880]  and present he have all written books admitting of their master plan to use chinese slave
[00:58.880 --> 01:05.440]  labor and chinese ingenuity to take over the planet they would use laws domestically
[01:05.440 --> 01:11.200]  in the west shut us down while moving all industry and all rare earth minerals and basically
[01:11.200 --> 01:18.520]  all deep water port operations to the chinese they would then double cross the west and
[01:18.520 --> 01:26.240]  do a counter strike on russia with nuclear weapons and that too has been declassified
[01:26.240 --> 01:33.300]  now they could always double cross the chinese but the elites have made their bed with china
[01:33.300 --> 01:39.400]  now i was going to walk in here today because i really meditated on it focused on it for
[01:39.400 --> 01:45.000]  hours this morning and i was going to announce that hillary clinton is a communist chinese
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.200]  spy and that the communist chinese are clearly the number one manipulators of our domestic
[01:51.200 --> 01:57.200]  operations allied with saudi arabia and others and the evidence is all there i've been told
[01:57.200 --> 02:01.340]  that by current and former high-level pentagon people have been told that by former and current
[02:01.340 --> 02:07.240]  spy chiefs but i don't need to listen to them i know i see the propaganda on tv and in movies
[02:07.240 --> 02:13.320]  and in print where there's almost no criticism of china and execution mills and mobile execution
[02:13.320 --> 02:18.640]  vans and people being forced to work 18 hours a day the most inhuman activities in the world
[02:18.640 --> 02:23.560]  and christians and buddhist being grabbed and their organs being sold beyond any horror
[02:23.560 --> 02:29.160]  movie you can imagine every science fiction movie i go see or every adventure movie i
[02:29.160 --> 02:35.120]  see the chinese are the innovators they run nasa we're all idiots the polar bearer loves
[02:35.120 --> 02:40.880]  us red flags are flying this is like what old men are telling hollywood to do it's so
[02:40.880 --> 02:46.840]  ham fisted it's so crazy i don't need to open the newspaper up to tell you china is
[02:46.840 --> 02:52.680]  taking over hollywood and if you think hollywood drooling and hating christians and gun owners
[02:52.680 --> 02:57.760]  and veterans was bad that's why they just merged perfectly with the inhuman communist
[02:57.760 --> 03:06.920]  chinese then i go to drudgereport.com after i already decided to do this today and guess
[03:06.920 --> 03:17.600]  what i see right there in the middle the hollywood reporter this is hollywood telling you this
[03:17.600 --> 03:23.440]  meet hollywood's new ruler china's richest man which is tied into the very families and
[03:23.440 --> 03:30.520]  groups that made the deal in 1949 with the communist and the cia and they're leveraging
[03:30.520 --> 03:38.920]  everything they've got to buy all six hollywood studios and the hollywood studios have been
[03:38.920 --> 03:44.280]  like hookers on a street corner shaking their asses sticking their legs out promising they
[03:44.280 --> 03:53.080]  give the best time i mean i have been watching hollywood in a total worship fest for communist
[03:53.080 --> 04:02.360]  china the most bloodthirsty murderous operation the globe has ever seen now i'm driving home
[04:02.360 --> 04:06.560]  last night and rob do calls me and he says have you seen the new pechenik video pechenik
[04:06.560 --> 04:11.040]  hasn't shown his face in 20 something years co-author of clancy's books he wasn't just
[04:11.040 --> 04:14.840]  in the state department i'll stop right there or the founders of delta force involved in
[04:14.840 --> 04:18.480]  overthrowing eight countries stuff he talks about here on air you know days later the
[04:18.480 --> 04:23.920]  fbi routinely shows up at his house this is not a game pechenik had called me last week
[04:23.920 --> 04:27.200]  said get ready you know we're launching a counter operation i don't know why no people
[04:27.200 --> 04:31.200]  are doing that okay great you'll come on as soon as you can go ahead and set up i think
[04:31.200 --> 04:37.840]  tomorrow he's coming on in 30 minutes and pechenik his bottom line said absolutely that's
[04:37.840 --> 04:42.480]  what's known is that it's not just influence of the chinese they're making a move with
[04:42.480 --> 04:47.040]  hillary on the us that's why the intelligence agencies are having to move on her not that
[04:47.040 --> 04:51.840]  they're even perfect but they know as as as general flinn has advised trump this is the
[04:51.840 --> 04:56.600]  end of america if you don't elect trump and if we don't stop hillary we're going into
[04:56.600 --> 05:02.440]  full resistance mode we have been taken over okay we have an article up on our website
[05:02.440 --> 05:07.760]  written by paul joseph watson details a former british ambassador saying hey john pedasta
[05:07.760 --> 05:13.000]  the email leak was done by a washington insider not russians well that's pretty obvious you
[05:13.000 --> 05:17.280]  should look to washington and not to mosco talking about british ambassador craig murray
[05:17.280 --> 05:22.120]  who says the source of the john pedasta email leak was a washington insider and not the russians
[05:22.120 --> 05:27.080]  as the clinton camp would like us all to believe he says quote the source of these emails and
[05:27.080 --> 05:31.280]  leaks has nothing to do with russia at all i discovered what the source was when i attended
[05:31.280 --> 05:36.400]  the sam madams whistleblower award in washington he then goes on to blast the narrative that
[05:36.400 --> 05:41.720]  wiki leaks is a conduit for russia by asserting that the claims are designed to divert attention
[05:41.720 --> 05:46.800]  from their content and material well said craig murray and it goes hand in hand with
[05:46.800 --> 05:50.840]  the narrative that the democrats are so desperate that i didn't even realize how absurd it sounds
[05:50.840 --> 05:56.120]  to blame the kgb for hijacking our democracy i'm margaret hell reporting for info wars

[08:31.960 --> 08:38.180]  well a few research reports shows that one in eight voter registrations are quote significantly
[08:38.180 --> 08:45.440]  inaccurate are no longer valid the corporate media in our country is no longer involved
[08:45.440 --> 08:55.200]  in journalism and their agenda is to elect crooked hillary clinton at any cost at any
[08:55.200 --> 09:02.680]  price no matter how many lives they destroy i i have presented the evidence to my viewers

[09:15.080 --> 09:21.360]  in twenty two primaries the votes have shifted in twenty of them the exit polling data in
[09:21.360 --> 09:41.760]  york state shifted twelve percent a shift in two percent is fraud live from the info wars.com
[09:41.760 --> 09:50.920]  studios there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even
[09:50.920 --> 09:57.760]  rig america's elections indiana state police rated the group the indiana voter registration
[09:57.760 --> 10:02.320]  project in an investigation of alleged voter registration fraud that has grown to fifty
[10:02.320 --> 10:09.840]  six counties crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones after the release
[10:09.840 --> 10:15.640]  of the latest project veritas videos in particular i want to draw your attention to robert kramer
[10:15.640 --> 10:20.840]  convicted felon who visited the white house according to reports three hundred and forty
[10:20.840 --> 10:26.120]  two times also met personally with the president some forty seven times the most recent occasion
[10:26.120 --> 10:40.200]  being in june of this year five days five days out ladies and gentlemen thank you so
[10:40.200 --> 10:45.200]  much for joining this hard to believe ladies and gentlemen that we are only five days out
[10:45.200 --> 10:51.360]  it is simply incredible wednesday november second two thousand and sixteen i'm your host
[10:51.360 --> 10:56.960]  alex jones we're going to be here for the next four hours we are going to break and
[10:56.960 --> 11:04.840]  document and confirm the most important news in modern history in the united states historical
[11:04.840 --> 11:12.480]  actions have already taken place and more are about to take place of the highest import
[11:12.480 --> 11:19.460]  of the highest importance obviously we have a new project veritas video it's up on info
[11:19.460 --> 11:25.200]  wars dot com it was got so much traffic it crashed their website and it's a top democrat
[11:25.200 --> 11:30.600]  saying that black people have something wrong with them and are stupid if they're supporting
[11:30.600 --> 11:36.720]  trump and then he uses the most perfect analogy using the german name for jews that helped
[11:36.720 --> 11:41.160]  round up other jews and kill them and says that black people that support trump are
[11:41.160 --> 11:46.720]  like that and it's just funny because this guy's jewish saying this and the liberals
[11:46.720 --> 11:53.560]  in this country follow that one of the top nazi collaborators of world war two incredibly
[11:53.560 --> 12:00.960]  prolific helping sniff out and round up jews george soros and then madeline albright her
[12:00.960 --> 12:10.000]  dad probably rivaled the exploits of the young george soros it's just when you know history
[12:10.000 --> 12:19.040]  it's so rich like when hillary accuses trump of russian ties with no evidence but they've
[12:19.040 --> 12:29.240]  opened up fbi investigations now closed one on trump opened one on manifold zero evidence
[12:29.240 --> 12:34.760]  former campaign head and it's exactly what hillary's up to and those emails have now
[12:34.760 --> 12:40.320]  come out with podesta hiding the money he was getting from russia and in hillary you
[12:40.320 --> 12:47.960]  know getting a huge amounts of money in her foundation for uranium and cobalt so you can
[12:47.960 --> 12:54.680]  build dirty bombs not just hydrogen bombs but jacket them with cobalt so that the half
[12:54.680 --> 13:03.080]  life is basically forever and it's extremely radioactive so a radiation bomb is what they
[13:03.080 --> 13:13.480]  are 40 megaton warhead jacketed and cobalt properly creates millions of times the radiation
[13:13.480 --> 13:18.240]  look it up millions millions of times and that's what our loving government and the
[13:18.240 --> 13:25.040]  russians have been developing for 40 years cobalt jacketed h bombs they're called doomsday
[13:25.040 --> 13:33.800]  bombs because they make the surface of the earth unlivable for basically ever this millions
[13:33.800 --> 13:40.240]  of years is forever for our species so there you have it that's the type of stuff we have
[13:40.240 --> 13:45.680]  here in front of us today but I'm going to get to our number one gigantic mega story
[13:45.680 --> 13:50.320]  that's bigger than anything we've ever covered and it's because it's hiding in plain view
[13:50.320 --> 13:55.280]  we've known this for a long time but now there's a mass awakening in our police and in our
[13:55.280 --> 14:01.720]  military and in the intelligence agencies and it ties into the front of a hollywood
[14:01.720 --> 14:09.720]  reporter today wanda chairman reveals ambitious plan to invest billions in all six hollywood
[14:09.720 --> 14:16.800]  studios that means take them over wang zhan lin china's quote richest man wants to take
[14:16.800 --> 14:24.480]  over the big six studios they already have to a great extent and that ties into what
[14:24.480 --> 14:29.840]  I was already going to cover today I have interviewed on and off air general spy chiefs
[14:29.840 --> 14:34.000]  former spy chiefs you name it and the consensus is and the evidence is overwhelming even in
[14:34.000 --> 14:43.480]  mainstream news that hillary ronald clinton is the number one communist chinese agent
[14:43.480 --> 14:48.440]  in the world and the wiki leaks all show that and she's in direct contact with the president
[14:48.440 --> 14:57.240]  of china doing his bidding to the point of she was representing him to other governments
[14:57.240 --> 15:02.120]  as well she's a globalist top-level operative like kissinger and i'm going to explain this
[15:02.120 --> 15:07.240]  very simply it's mainline history taught by the council on foreign relations not taught
[15:07.240 --> 15:12.520]  to the general public but taught to executives available if you want to know a deal was made
[15:12.520 --> 15:16.840]  in the seventies to move all of our industry to china give them all the deep water ports
[15:16.840 --> 15:21.440]  all the main infrastructure the panama canal the rare earth minerals leverage out global
[15:21.440 --> 15:28.600]  competition in the competition consolidate control through a rigged economy by putting
[15:28.600 --> 15:35.800]  regulations on the west but not on china dominate and then dictate the terms of economic surrender
[15:35.800 --> 15:41.800]  to the planet and that's why it's come out that her aid reportedly gave classified information
[15:41.800 --> 15:47.160]  to china it's all high trees and ladies and gentlemen that's why she wears nineteen sixties
[15:47.160 --> 15:55.480]  malice era outfits silk outfits from china it's a total message that i'm your bitch to china
[15:59.240 --> 16:00.680]  we have been blowing wide open
[16:03.160 --> 16:03.480]  now
[16:06.440 --> 16:09.800]  steve patinix obviously told me a lot of stuff off area hasn't told the public
[16:09.800 --> 16:14.600]  i'm i'm going to really push him today to just do it and i don't just get my information from
[16:14.600 --> 16:18.360]  steve patinix this came out in the eighties in the nineties it came out in the news the
[16:18.360 --> 16:24.200]  missile secrets the reentry devices you know the merb technology the multiple uh reentry device
[16:24.200 --> 16:29.800]  systems all of it the booster systems the whole thing that's cruise missiles nuclear reactors
[16:29.800 --> 16:42.520]  our government gave china everything after 1949 everything everything they're fighters they're
[16:42.520 --> 16:49.320]  helicopters it's all copies now we have been maneuvered into this treason and so of course
[16:49.320 --> 16:57.000]  trump comes out and says oh yeah wang john lin thinks he's going to get us by the short hairs
[17:00.360 --> 17:05.960]  trump is going to grab china's wang you better know that i don't mean that as a joke they know it
[17:06.520 --> 17:12.760]  he's an american he doesn't like cns get a raw deal he's coming and trump represents america
[17:12.760 --> 17:19.480]  returning he didn't perfect but he's america i'm america you're america no matter what color you

[17:24.040 --> 17:29.160]  on the media all day that are nothing compared to china and constant pissing on the republic
[17:29.160 --> 17:33.640]  to make us feel bad while nothing is said about china and mobile execution vans and robots
[17:33.640 --> 17:40.680]  replacing people and christians and everybody having their organs harvested good god and the left
[17:40.680 --> 17:45.400]  gets all the deals for the apple factories and the suicide nets and the and the worst labor

[18:13.000 --> 18:17.320]  and it's these guys worth hundreds of billions of dollars like wang zhun lin
[18:20.120 --> 18:24.360]  saying they're in a communist country with a bunch of slaves under them that's what communism is
[18:24.360 --> 18:28.280]  when obama says you can't have a car you can't have air conditioning and he's in a jumbo jet
[18:28.280 --> 18:36.920]  china is the global model for world government the last four chinese presidents say that
[18:36.920 --> 18:41.480]  constantly in the news china and its model of communism is the ultimate expression of capitalism
[18:41.480 --> 18:45.400]  in the global governance model and is being adopted on a planetary scale these are quotes
[18:48.600 --> 18:54.760]  americans must be taught that they cannot have their firearms americans must be brought on the line
[18:54.760 --> 19:01.080]  with the global community and china's model these are quotes let's skip the break most important
[19:01.080 --> 19:05.960]  information we ever covered now we know this but i mean there are articles out today where we're
[19:05.960 --> 19:11.960]  being dictated that you cannot act masculine or show your arms in college now if you have big
[19:11.960 --> 19:17.560]  muscles because it's hurtful to women they're they're emasculating the country folks saying men

[21:00.280 --> 21:07.960]  and what we've done to watch this country taken over and shut down now we keep saying where where's
[21:07.960 --> 21:11.320]  the military where's the police where's the fbi where all these agencies i'll tell you where they are
[21:11.320 --> 21:20.200]  they're waiting for you they've put out the wiki leaks by the way it was in 2009 the inspector
[21:20.200 --> 21:23.880]  general sent letters that have just now been released the last month paul was an article on
[21:23.880 --> 21:28.360]  this saying investigate the state department and and the way hillary's handling information
[21:29.000 --> 21:34.040]  they were telling you then it was happening the national archives as well then more came out
[21:34.040 --> 21:41.800]  in 2012 2013 investigations were begun the fbi whitewashed it all julien assange was given the
[21:41.800 --> 21:47.080]  intel by people inside the intelligence community i'm gonna stop right there so they start the
[21:47.080 --> 21:50.760]  narrative it's the russians the russians have hacked up before they admit it when they do it's
[21:50.760 --> 21:54.920]  stuff that affects them it's international they they are really good about not getting involved
[21:55.720 --> 22:00.760]  an actual statecraft and telling the us not to with them they only got into un because that treaty
[22:00.760 --> 22:05.960]  affected them for carbon taxes and other things like that they're constantly hacking the un they're
[22:05.960 --> 22:10.120]  constantly hacking us diplomats when they're doing international stuff internal stuff russia's
[22:10.120 --> 22:15.320]  been leaving alone it's china while it works for the globalist bombarding the united states
[22:15.320 --> 22:22.760]  because the globalist are letting china do it to penetrate things on purpose china reportedly
[22:22.760 --> 22:28.200]  has something like 200 times a day more cyber attacks going on to the us than russia does
[22:28.200 --> 22:34.200]  us russia basically isn't cyber attacking anything and they admit that there's organized crime over
[22:34.200 --> 22:37.240]  there that has credit card theft and stuff like that and russia certainly got its problems
[22:38.360 --> 22:44.520]  but the issue here is ladies and gentlemen china is hammering the hell probing everything
[22:44.520 --> 22:49.240]  super belligerent super arrogant has penetrated everything tells the president get off the back
[22:49.240 --> 22:55.400]  of the plane total big insult in asia to rub his face in the manure scream at the diplomats on the
[22:55.400 --> 23:00.920]  tarmac saying this is our country you go if you don't like it because they have no respect for us
[23:00.920 --> 23:06.040]  because they've penetrated us and they've bought us and they control us and ladies and gentlemen
[23:06.040 --> 23:10.600]  when you see fake liberal media these are the most pathetic sad people in the world you are seeing
[23:10.600 --> 23:15.160]  teleprompter readers who have been hired because they're empty nobodies who will say any lie or
[23:15.160 --> 23:19.720]  do anything no wonder the big newspapers are collapsing they've announced today revenue down
[23:19.720 --> 23:29.960]  95 percent in quarterly profit they're in freefall total freefall because people now know this isn't
[23:29.960 --> 23:37.480]  just liberal idiots these are enemy operatives do you understand these are the most disgraceful
[23:37.480 --> 23:46.440]  dishonored actual officers of a take they are literal collaborators in the cloth of the vici
[23:46.440 --> 23:52.840]  french the french stood down in world war two the maginal line and all that crap and dungkirk
[23:52.840 --> 23:57.640]  only the british funnel the british military didn't fully stand down but the french did
[23:57.640 --> 24:02.200]  because the general staff was already sold by hitler they took over france the next day hitler
[24:02.200 --> 24:07.880]  two weeks later was in paris the french were told by the media stand down and do what hitler said
[24:07.880 --> 24:19.640]  do you understand that that's the same deal it's a covert operation and they are all arrogant up
[24:19.640 --> 24:25.800]  there and so there's been a counter to we've told you about this for the last year and now we've had
[24:25.800 --> 24:32.520]  william benny come out we've had um the british former british top ambassador come out and said
[24:32.520 --> 24:37.000]  that he was at a meeting with the u.s government just a few weeks ago and we have the clip coming
[24:37.000 --> 24:41.720]  up and they said no and he was told who did it actually here's the deal they know who did it
[24:41.720 --> 24:45.960]  they don't want to go bust them because they can show its espionage against our country and that
[24:45.960 --> 24:49.640]  they were doing this as patriots and then they can't blame the russians they don't want to go grab
[24:50.680 --> 24:55.880]  the people and let me tell you what's very close to happening there's very close to a press conference
[24:57.880 --> 25:02.280]  being held with members of the fbi nsa cia defense intelligence you name it
[25:02.280 --> 25:06.920]  but people like general flinn there who was the head of defense intelligence two years ago when
[25:06.920 --> 25:10.760]  they kicked him out of there because he wouldn't work for al-qaeda you understand what you're hearing
[25:10.760 --> 25:16.760]  right now they're very close to a press conference and just coming out and saying this is who did it
[25:16.760 --> 25:20.760]  blah blah blah did it for america these people are traders they're communist chinese agents
[25:20.760 --> 25:26.280]  they're saudi agents here's even more boom you're going down and all of you that work for this are
[25:26.280 --> 25:32.520]  the scum of the earth and weak minded filth now let's go ahead and play dr steve pacenek never
[25:32.520 --> 25:39.400]  shown his face in 25 years breaking down ladies and gentlemen for the first time ever what's really
[25:39.400 --> 25:44.200]  happened with the soft coup and it is going and we haven't completely won because hillary's launched a
[25:44.200 --> 25:50.200]  coup they're effectively in control of the u.s right now america is battling for its life right
[25:50.200 --> 25:58.520]  now you understand that here it is on november 1 2016 hillary and bill clinton and their entourage
[25:58.520 --> 26:07.480]  of assistance affected a civilian coup in contrast to the usual concept of a coup where the military
[26:07.480 --> 26:12.920]  is involved and takes over the white house and communication centers very much like the scenarios
[26:12.920 --> 26:19.560]  you see in a movie this coup was done silently and very effectively through two methods corruption
[26:19.560 --> 26:27.400]  and co-optation the clinton's have been involved in co-opting our white house our judiciary our
[26:27.400 --> 26:33.960]  cia our federal bureau of investigation our attorney general loretta lynch and our director
[26:33.960 --> 26:39.400]  of the fbi james combing for some time now what they've done is to make sure that they were part
[26:39.400 --> 26:47.960]  and parcel of a group of people who were interrelated through political cronyism however in order to stop
[26:47.960 --> 26:54.760]  this coup we in the intelligence community and others involved have informally gotten together
[26:55.320 --> 26:59.960]  and with their permission i am beginning to announce that we've initiated a counter coup
[27:00.600 --> 27:08.920]  through julian assange and wiki leaks what has happened in effect when uh combi had to open up
[27:08.920 --> 27:17.000]  the case of hillary clinton and discussed the emails that were involved with the anthony weiner case
[27:17.000 --> 27:23.160]  it was not the case itself that was as important as the fact that this was the entree for many of
[27:23.160 --> 27:29.480]  us in the counter coup to say to the administration we have your number not only do we have your
[27:29.480 --> 27:35.320]  number we're going to stop you from making hillary the president of the united states and at the same
[27:35.320 --> 27:42.360]  time we will convict and indict the president of the united states loretta lynch and many others
[27:42.360 --> 27:47.400]  who were involved in the cover-up of the massive corruption that occurred under the clinton foundation
[27:48.040 --> 27:53.960]  now in both cases their coup was silent and our counter coup was silent and it was all
[27:55.240 --> 28:01.160]  transgressed or occurred on the internet and this is probably the first time in the history of any
[28:01.160 --> 28:07.400]  country where a coup was initiated on through the internet and a counter coup was initiated through
[28:07.400 --> 28:13.640]  the internet i am just a small part of something far bigger than myself it was the brave men and
[28:13.640 --> 28:22.040]  women who were in the fbi the cia the director of intelligence the uh military intelligence and
[28:22.040 --> 28:28.440]  men and women in 15 other intelligence organizations who were sick and tired of seeing this corruption
[28:28.440 --> 28:33.480]  in the white house and the justice department and an intelligence system and we decided that
[28:33.480 --> 28:39.320]  there was something we had to do in order to save the republic so we initiated a counter coup
[28:39.320 --> 28:47.000]  through julian the sage who's been very brave and and really quite formidable in his and his
[28:47.000 --> 28:54.600]  ability to come forth and provide all the necessary emails that we gave to him in order to undermine
[28:54.600 --> 29:01.800]  hillary and bill clinton again america we're going through a major major transition and quite frankly
[29:01.800 --> 29:08.520]  a second american revolution we do not have guns we do not have weapons we do not intend to kill
[29:08.520 --> 29:14.760]  anybody we do not intend to harm anybody but we the american public and those of us who serve
[29:14.760 --> 29:22.040]  as veterans and in an intelligence service like myself will stop the clinton's from assuming power
[29:22.040 --> 29:29.160]  that they don't deserve at the same time we will make certain that obama leaves without any trail
[29:29.160 --> 29:35.320]  of a uh i had pardon or any other active trees all right ladies and gentlemen that's dr steve

[30:00.680 --> 30:05.880]  attorney general eric holder who's now an attorney that works for the production of wall street
[30:05.880 --> 30:11.480]  clients at covington burling has written a nasty op-ed scolding fbi director james comey for his
[30:11.480 --> 30:16.760]  handling of the investigation into clinton's emails and the use of a private server he writes
[30:16.760 --> 30:22.120]  an op-ed in the washington post and says quote i fear he is unintentionally and negatively
[30:22.120 --> 30:27.560]  affected public trust in both the justice department and the fbi as he is allowed again without
[30:27.560 --> 30:33.240]  improper motive misinformation to be spread by partisans with less than pure intentions he goes
[30:33.240 --> 30:38.760]  on to accuse comey of violating long-standing policies and traditions when the fbi director
[30:38.760 --> 30:44.200]  wrote to members of congress on friday and informed them that the fbi was in fact reviewing a fresh
[30:44.200 --> 30:49.320]  batch of emails related to clinton i guess that long-standing policy is never to question hillary
[30:49.320 --> 30:55.000]  clinton will some of us feel that confidence was restored in the doj in the fbi mr holder as they

[36:37.480 --> 36:42.280]  chinese are at the heart of it the soddies are involved others are involved and we're having
[36:42.280 --> 36:48.040]  everything dictated to us like we were china 200 years ago that was a colony of the west and broken
[36:48.040 --> 36:55.080]  into 12 parts america is losing its sovereignty we are being bankrupted by design and the globalists
[36:55.080 --> 37:01.000]  admit this is their philosophy so they can dictate the terms of the united states basic surrender
[37:01.000 --> 37:06.120]  to this hegemonic system and the problem is the system that we're going into is so authoritarian
[37:06.840 --> 37:11.080]  i mean we don't hear any criticism of china for human rights abuses any of it now selling political
[37:11.080 --> 37:15.640]  business organs christians and buddhist organs that's just an example of what i'm talking about and how
[37:16.200 --> 37:21.240]  if the philippine says america's over you're done china runs everything now get out of our country
[37:21.240 --> 37:26.120]  he knows hillary's penetrated hillary and the wiki leaks has represented the chinese president just
[37:26.120 --> 37:31.560]  two years ago total treason you can just google it it comes up that that that she represents the
[37:31.560 --> 37:38.840]  chinese represents anybody she's like a street walking whore and it is it is so bold and insane
[37:38.840 --> 37:43.240]  that we've let this get to this point so dr steve pacenic at steve pacenic dot com
[37:43.240 --> 37:48.600]  put out a video yesterday breaking down the fact that hillary and her cohorts have done a coup on
[37:48.600 --> 37:55.400]  america look at the fbi i mean it's she's about the law and so that people in the military the
[37:55.400 --> 37:58.840]  different intelligence agencies that we know have been giving wiki leaks the red info the british
[37:58.840 --> 38:03.320]  ambassadors come out uh william bennie has said on air and off air i mean he's gone further than
[38:03.320 --> 38:08.440]  we did six months ago he says it is u.s intelligence doing this and they're ready for the government
[38:08.440 --> 38:13.640]  to try to come after them and others and ready to basically do press conferences
[38:15.640 --> 38:19.560]  saying oh okay you know here are the people that released it because this is treason
[38:19.560 --> 38:23.800]  go ahead and try to prosecute us they were hoping that the fbi was would do the right thing and and
[38:23.800 --> 38:29.160]  would keep hillary out but they're ready folks so hillary one way or another uh is in deep
[38:29.160 --> 38:34.440]  trouble and dr steve pacenic again one of the found founders of delta force head of psychological
[38:34.440 --> 38:40.600]  warfare in the state department um ran admittedly this is in the bbc you name it has run the
[38:40.600 --> 38:45.160]  overthrow of at least six governments he's the real deal in covert action he's a psychiatrist but
[38:45.160 --> 38:50.600]  also has a degree from mit most of you know who he is but he's never been seen in 25 years co-wrote
[38:50.600 --> 38:55.800]  books with tom clancy he's the character jack ryan's based on hadn't been seen in 25 years
[38:55.800 --> 38:59.160]  this is a guy that you know sends me photos when he's inside north korea you know when he's on
[38:59.160 --> 39:03.880]  vacation wink wink i mean he's the real deal everybody knows that and you've seen the things
[39:03.880 --> 39:09.080]  he's talked about over the years come true and so he's dialed in folks and we're dialed in as well
[39:09.080 --> 39:14.920]  we've checked the things he said with high-level folks and notice general flinn is advising uh
[39:15.560 --> 39:21.480]  trump he's one of the leaders of the resistance okay so all of this is happening this is history
[39:21.480 --> 39:25.800]  happening i'm gonna try to shut up now give him the floor till the end of the hour dr steve pacenic
[39:25.800 --> 39:32.200]  please roll through what we're facing the stages we're at right now five days out from the election
[39:32.200 --> 39:38.040]  with their takeover group versus the ghost of george washington i'd call it fighting for this country's
[39:38.040 --> 39:46.840]  life well as i've said before on your show in other places we had a civil coup that was initiated
[39:46.840 --> 39:53.960]  by hillary and her cohorts based on corruption and political cronyism we had a counter coup which
[39:53.960 --> 40:01.000]  was initiated several days ago by some of the people in 16 different organizations as you mentioned
[40:01.000 --> 40:08.280]  however there's been more and more information coming out and now we are concerned that two people
[40:08.280 --> 40:15.480]  are specifically targeted by our intelligence system one is umma abadi the issue of umma abadi
[40:15.480 --> 40:21.480]  and her connections to saudi arabia and the salafis and particularly with those salafis or
[40:21.480 --> 40:31.480]  a mom who funded al qaeda and subsequently uh presumably osama ben laden she is a very uh concerned
[40:31.480 --> 40:37.560]  target for us and the reason for that is the question is she was born here in the united states
[40:37.560 --> 40:43.800]  left after two years and came went back to saudi arabia the family's prominent wealthy they know
[40:43.800 --> 40:50.600]  are you guys know the story the real key issue is how did she come back in 1996 get to the top of the
[40:50.600 --> 40:58.120]  uh ladder political ladder and become an assistant to hillary clinton when in fact her connections
[40:58.120 --> 41:04.200]  including her mother her brother and others are very much tied in with the wahabi saudi arabia
[41:04.200 --> 41:10.120]  and the government the answer from my perspective and possibly from those who i work with is that
[41:10.120 --> 41:17.640]  she's very much of an agent uh of influence and both operative infiltrated on behalf of the saudi
[41:17.640 --> 41:21.960]  arabia now and that's why she had the 650 thousand emails reportedly under the name
[41:21.960 --> 41:29.080]  insurance on hillary gathering data that's part of it but what what alex what i really want to talk
[41:29.080 --> 41:39.480]  about is the fact uh she's been here for a long time and the question is who gave her the top
[41:39.480 --> 41:46.600]  secret clearance that she could have received after having been here only two years after 1996
[41:46.600 --> 41:53.720]  so the question goes back to who in fact in our three letter agency worked in saudi arabia
[41:54.280 --> 42:00.840]  there's only one agency it's either catholics in action or the cia john brennan who has been
[42:00.840 --> 42:07.720]  very close to the saudi arabians and also the israelis now why do i talk to about both these
[42:07.720 --> 42:16.680]  issues the ultimate distraction in this whole storyline with umma abedin and anthony weiner has
[42:16.680 --> 42:23.960]  been to me somewhat of a farce it's been a either contrived or combination of you know ongoing
[42:23.960 --> 42:31.160]  problems but a highly contrived scenario which distracts from the fact that umma abedin is very
[42:31.160 --> 42:38.600]  much of a saudi agent however she married a jew uh you know a pathetic jew but nevertheless
[42:38.600 --> 42:45.160]  that neutralized the notion that she was a total saudi influence at the same time there's a man
[42:45.160 --> 42:52.440]  by the name who we're targeting named peter kachik kadc ick that's news he works with a law firm in
[42:52.440 --> 42:59.240]  washington dc called dixie and shepiro i know dixie and shepiro i know this senior partner
[42:59.240 --> 43:04.680]  they already live in they're not very good lawyers qua lawyers but they're extremely
[43:04.680 --> 43:10.440]  good at lobbying 10 15 years ago they would charge me something like 600 dollars per hour
[43:11.080 --> 43:15.960]  so you know they're not the smartest lawyers but they could be the most corrupt lawyers in the
[43:15.960 --> 43:21.960]  business peter kachik was brought into the justice department as a result of being podesta's
[43:21.960 --> 43:28.760]  lawyer and peter kachik got podesta off of criminal charges podesta who's as stupid as
[43:28.760 --> 43:34.440]  the day is long made a comment saying this is my kind of lawyer he makes sure that i never go to
[43:34.440 --> 43:42.120]  prison so what we have is a jewish law firm dixie and shepiro with a jewish representative peter
[43:42.120 --> 43:49.480]  kachik who is in turn going to evaluate and investigate a corruption trial with umma abedin
[43:49.480 --> 43:55.960]  that's that's a complete farce and the farce continues because the corruption that's going
[43:55.960 --> 44:03.160]  on between hillary clinton and obama is so serious that when i said weeks ago that we had a civilian
[44:03.160 --> 44:10.440]  coup and that we in the intelligence community informally initiated a counter coup that's a major
[44:10.440 --> 44:14.760]  major statement now sure when you talk about history uh and i'm confirmed with a lot of
[44:14.760 --> 44:18.840]  horrible folks people are now ready to pretty much do anything to save the country because
[44:18.840 --> 44:25.160]  every other way an avenue to fix things has been uh uh basically shut down so now let's get
[44:25.160 --> 44:30.760]  to the historical point we are just for lay folks out there dr pacanik about what why this has been
[44:30.760 --> 44:35.640]  activated what you think is now going to unfold the next five days where we're going i mean explain
[44:35.640 --> 44:41.640]  to folks talk to us like we're not you know former spy chiefs what's what's been activated is really
[44:41.640 --> 44:48.760]  an american revolution through the words of adana trump uh he may or may not know the specifics but
[44:48.760 --> 44:54.440]  that's not as important as the fact that he brought out the temperance and the anger that the american
[44:54.440 --> 44:59.800]  public feels including what you said was sure he's being advised by people that i know full well
[44:59.800 --> 45:04.920]  are part of the counter operation so that's why i know michael flinn i i i have the highest respect
[45:04.920 --> 45:10.280]  i can't say anything more he was a director of intelligence and the defense intelligence agency
[45:10.280 --> 45:15.160]  so there are those in the defense intelligence agency with whom i have worked and still continue
[45:15.160 --> 45:21.080]  to work so we're at a key point what the intelligence community is saying is that there are several
[45:21.080 --> 45:26.760]  charges that want to be that want to be dealt with uh in regard to hillary clinton they want her to
[45:26.760 --> 45:35.480]  be indicted for bribery corruption uh obstruction of justice lying under oath and most importantly
[45:35.480 --> 45:42.360]  it's a rico charge that's again that's what we use against the gambino family and the crime families
[45:42.360 --> 45:47.560]  and the reason we want to initiate that and there will be a prosecutor to come forth to
[45:47.560 --> 45:52.760]  prosecute her whether she gets into the white house or not is because she has been involved in
[45:52.760 --> 45:59.320]  massive corruption with massive collusion now you you're getting other people involved as well so
[45:59.320 --> 46:04.600]  you're talking about obama you're talking about loretta lynch you're talking about a peter katschak
[46:04.600 --> 46:09.160]  you're talking about a whole line of people including the podesta brothers who have been
[46:09.160 --> 46:15.080]  involved in this collusion of corruption with russia where we go from here we have five to six days
[46:15.080 --> 46:21.480]  to go if she is elected there will be an initiative initiative to impeach her as the president of the
[46:21.480 --> 46:28.040]  united states our suspicion is that obama will not pardon her the reason for that is obama is too
[46:28.040 --> 46:33.560]  smart he too came in through the intelligence system as i said before particularly this via
[46:33.560 --> 46:39.480]  he worked for peter geithner he worked for the asian of society he is a front for many of these
[46:39.480 --> 46:46.680]  groups contrary to what he said his story is total nonsense he was not a initiator of civil
[46:46.680 --> 46:52.920]  action in the local level he was very much a product of the cia but you've got to remember
[46:52.920 --> 46:58.200]  two things saudi arabia's had a major influence in our government since the clinton's the bush
[46:58.200 --> 47:04.280]  seniors the bush juniors and now hillary they wanted to make sure that they had somebody very close
[47:04.280 --> 47:11.960]  to the to the hand of power and in this case they initiated or impenetrated umma abedin
[47:11.960 --> 47:18.200]  very early on in 96 and i've got to say as a counterintelligence agent they did a very good job
[47:18.200 --> 47:23.800]  because no one in the press not one person in the intelligence community other than the people i've
[47:23.800 --> 47:29.480]  dealt with have really spotted this secondly there's an issue of diversity that people are
[47:29.480 --> 47:34.920]  concerned about particularly obama well we have diversity because israel has also penetrated our
[47:34.920 --> 47:40.920]  intelligence as you've seen with uh michael turd off and the other people involved in 911
[47:40.920 --> 47:47.240]  so this is a continuation of the corruption and collusion that our government in washington dc
[47:47.240 --> 47:51.720]  has committed against the america sure so let's let's boil it down the dr pochetic
[47:51.720 --> 47:55.960]  i mean you put out powerful videos this you've gone public you haven't been seen on video in
[47:55.960 --> 48:01.000]  two decades now you got out of the council in fron relations 15 years ago and rebuked them for 911
[48:01.000 --> 48:05.080]  you've been exposing it all you've been dead on about the devolution back to the states the
[48:05.080 --> 48:10.600]  brexit catalonia predicted it here five years ago before it even you know happened so you're
[48:10.600 --> 48:14.280]  talking to folks inside the government you're talking to all your contacts different agencies
[48:14.280 --> 48:19.960]  you were with the state department were basically with them all uh and now clearly people understand
[48:19.960 --> 48:25.080]  we have to act and the intel i've gotten is we have to act because hillary knows time is not
[48:25.080 --> 48:29.720]  on her side they're going to move to sew up the country shut down internet freedom and try to
[48:29.720 --> 48:34.280]  basically shut us down so that's why we've got to go into high gear because they realize long
[48:34.280 --> 48:39.960]  term we have the momentum they want to shut down the peaceful process we've been using to counter
[48:39.960 --> 48:45.000]  them because they know we're winning they want to push it into a destabilization program activated
[48:45.000 --> 48:49.800]  with soros and others the black lives matter and so this is a critical juncture right now as you said
[48:49.800 --> 48:54.280]  history is happening right now a major moment in history probably one of the most important in our
[48:54.280 --> 49:00.360]  history what can the public do uh you know to make sure this criminal is brought to justice well they
[49:00.360 --> 49:07.000]  can accept they can uh support trump with the with the fact that he said this election is rigged in
[49:07.000 --> 49:14.360]  other words when the results come in they can defy the results and stand up and say we don't accept
[49:14.360 --> 49:19.960]  the results and the reason for that is again you've talked about and you had a very intelligent
[49:19.960 --> 49:25.320]  woman talk about the fact that the debauling machineries and dominion have really rigged the
[49:25.320 --> 49:31.960]  machineries in such a way that if hillary is viable as that lovely lady said she will win if
[49:31.960 --> 49:37.480]  that's the case then the american public have to stand up without violence and say we cannot accept
[49:37.480 --> 49:42.760]  this election result there will be no way that hillary can win legally that's right they're
[49:42.760 --> 49:46.680]  already fractionally shaving they're already flipping all over they're already sawing the
[49:46.680 --> 49:52.200]  narrative trumps losing even in rigged polls sampling 12 percent more abc and a bunch of others
[49:52.200 --> 49:57.880]  he is now six eight nine ten points ahead well there's no question that trump will be in the
[49:57.880 --> 50:03.080]  forefront there's no question that trump will not accept the results of the election i will also
[50:03.080 --> 50:09.000]  say neither will the intelligent community accept the results of the election the most honorable
[50:09.000 --> 50:15.160]  thing that hillary could do and i doubt she'll do it is to resign probably the only person i can
[50:15.160 --> 50:21.080]  appeal to within that family whom i do know and i think i i regard her quite high is
[50:21.080 --> 50:26.920]  chelsea i've known her since she was a teenager she has had the same concerns about the clinton
[50:26.920 --> 50:32.760]  foundation that we've had she's had major concerns about the corruption about the fact that the
[50:32.760 --> 50:39.320]  foundation was taken over by the potestas and band or wherever the man was working with bill clinton
[50:39.320 --> 50:46.200]  she's also the one who gave us the tip off on the fact that 10 000 Haitians were killed because
[50:46.200 --> 50:52.200]  of the clinton initiatives in Haiti and she's dismissed so i can appeal to her on the part
[50:52.200 --> 50:58.200]  of the united states to say to her tell your mother to stand down if she does not stand down
[50:58.200 --> 51:03.720]  this will continue as a revolution hopefully civil hopefully without violence well let me bring
[51:03.720 --> 51:07.560]  this up you're one of the foremost psychological warfare guys ever you got the camp david according
[51:07.560 --> 51:10.120]  to his passion i mean you're credited for running those the only successful court ever
[51:10.680 --> 51:15.240]  and then right through the modern times behind the scenes uh how would you what would you say
[51:15.240 --> 51:19.880]  about hillary i know you personally know she seems to have generated i mean what i can say about
[51:19.880 --> 51:24.680]  hillary it's you don't need a psychiatrist to basically say what i've said all along it's a
[51:24.680 --> 51:31.640]  woman who has come to the point of such self-destruction that she in turn will bring the whole country
[51:31.640 --> 51:38.920]  in into a self-destructive mode it's a woman who never really could achieve the the aspirations
[51:38.920 --> 51:44.600]  that she stated in other words she claims she went to Yale that's true but unfortunately she's not
[51:44.600 --> 51:50.200]  as bright as she thought she was she wasn't as accomplished as she maintained she is her judgment
[51:50.200 --> 51:55.480]  is terrible her ability to assess strategy and tactics is terrible by the way her wiki leaks all
[51:55.480 --> 52:01.160]  her colleagues say she's a disaster and a horrible person that's it okay well i'm going to quote and
[52:01.160 --> 52:06.360]  i don't mean to death but i'm going to quote general colon pal who said everything she touches
[52:06.360 --> 52:13.480]  she messes up and then he has the word hubris with pride so you have an arrogant ineffectual
[52:13.480 --> 52:18.680]  loser dysfunctional woman who wants to be the president of the united states has never really
[52:18.680 --> 52:24.680]  initiated anything on her own or accomplished any accomplishment of any significant she's a
[52:24.680 --> 52:31.240]  clear and present danger she's a total clean present danger however in that sense i do not want
[52:31.240 --> 52:37.320]  any attempts at assassination i do not want an overthrow of the government this is a natural
[52:37.320 --> 52:43.400]  evolution in the world in the world of the internet and the binary numbers what makes this so
[52:43.400 --> 52:51.080]  interesting is the fact that you matt drudge limbo shonhanity uh fox news brit human a whole
[52:51.080 --> 52:57.160]  bunch of others have really pushed the agenda that we've had and understood how to debride
[52:57.160 --> 53:03.240]  all of the nonsense that went on i want to give special thanks to lewdogs who on the major networks
[53:03.240 --> 53:09.080]  really kept pushing on and saying look you republicans are a failure you democrats are failure
[53:09.080 --> 53:12.760]  and we know the white house and hillary targeted him had him removed so so let's stop there on the
[53:12.760 --> 53:18.280]  time we have this is amazing dr butchening uh this moment in history let's look at who the players are
[53:18.280 --> 53:23.720]  are behind her what she might pull clearly the communist chinese are in a very belligerent mode
[53:23.720 --> 53:29.880]  they say they're buying all six hollywood studios they've got philippines running around hopping up
[53:29.880 --> 53:34.440]  and down insulting us obama has to get off the back of planes they think she's getting in they're
[53:34.440 --> 53:39.400]  really with the sawdies behind all this from my research why would our elites allow this this is
[53:39.400 --> 53:44.600]  this is literally insane even we have corrupt elites this is like letting us be completely
[53:44.600 --> 53:50.200]  decapitated when america's been the whole power of this modern empire let me explain something
[53:50.200 --> 53:55.720]  i know you you you think the chinese are involved in all of this first of all i've worked in hollywood
[53:55.720 --> 54:00.680]  i remember the producer's guild hollywood is finished for the most part they can buy whatever
[54:00.680 --> 54:05.240]  they want no i know you know that but you've personally told me that hillary is a chinese
[54:05.240 --> 54:09.400]  operative though no i i've never doubted that what i want to get to is a far more important
[54:09.400 --> 54:15.480]  point about china and china is listening right now and they know i know this if we want to bring
[54:15.480 --> 54:22.520]  down china it's very easy for us to do it half a billion chinese above the angsty and the yellow
[54:22.520 --> 54:29.320]  river have absolutely no water the chinese are poised against the indian army as well as the
[54:29.320 --> 54:33.640]  pashmere now i know we can bring them down but we don't have the elite to do it that's my problem
[54:33.640 --> 54:40.360]  i don't know that you always keep your your your gun loaded but you don't pull the trigger
[54:40.360 --> 54:45.480]  the chinese have been warned repeatedly that water without water they can i agree so why are
[54:45.480 --> 54:50.280]  they so belligerent right now they're not there they're doing what's best for their interests
[54:50.280 --> 54:55.080]  right now you know everybody claimed the russians were belligerent they weren't the chinese are
[54:55.080 --> 55:00.040]  really far more interested and i'm not apologizing for the chinese they're far more interested in
[55:00.040 --> 55:06.520]  building a merchant supply system along the lines that the dutch did around the 15 or 16 system
[55:06.520 --> 55:12.280]  they're not interested in a model yeah i get it you it's the it's the dutch indian model they are
[55:12.280 --> 55:19.080]  now building railroad train tracks in jibouti and africa and the indian ocean they're far more
[55:19.080 --> 55:22.840]  interested in picking up the resources sure so here's the bottom line i'm dropping around
[55:22.840 --> 55:28.520]  dr pacenic you know major counter coup how is that coup taking place obviously wikileaks more
[55:28.520 --> 55:32.120]  coming talk of press conferences if hillary doesn't do the right thing i mean what else
[55:33.240 --> 55:38.600]  the fact that you and i are talking the fact that hillary had to mention alex jones
[55:38.600 --> 55:44.520]  and the presumed nonsense that came out of our stations the fact that you have become a very serious
[55:45.240 --> 55:51.640]  threat to the establishment has already been a very major accomplishment of the counter coup
[55:51.640 --> 55:56.920]  and that's why our intelligence services works through this and they're not using you they're
[55:56.920 --> 56:01.640]  simply stating for the same reason that the secret service came through and said look
[56:01.640 --> 56:06.760]  ellery cannot function she has had his uh Parkinson's disease we mentioned that sure
[56:06.760 --> 56:11.320]  none of us are manipulating each other we just see the same thing happening well the point is
[56:11.320 --> 56:17.960]  what you want is a definitive end to this person that's not going to happen what's going to happen
[56:17.960 --> 56:24.200]  because the way we work in america is that gradually we will take away every political power
[56:24.200 --> 56:28.440]  that she has including umma abedin peter kagchik
[56:28.440 --> 56:34.120]  podesta and all those who will undermine and bring out our minions well exactly correct we're
[56:34.120 --> 56:40.120]  warning them now that we will go after them and they are highly vulnerable and everyone who's been
[56:40.120 --> 56:45.960]  a part of the clinton foundation to receive money we have their names we have their names we know the
[56:45.960 --> 56:50.840]  amount of money that they've received and it's very easy for us to pick it off for example this
[56:50.840 --> 56:56.920]  peter kagchik he better resign because we can go after him for pollution we can go after him for
[56:56.920 --> 57:02.680]  your regular activities as a lawyer we if we want we can go after dixie and shepiro for many other
[57:02.680 --> 57:08.040]  travesties they can come back and say whatever they want but i know barry live in and what i'm
[57:08.040 --> 57:13.480]  saying is this is a warning to them this is a warning to everyone man now you know i do not
[57:13.480 --> 57:20.760]  give a warning you know as well that what i've said comes around in time i cannot give you
[57:20.760 --> 57:27.720]  an endpoint but i will tell you come november 8th trump will declare the fact either he's one
[57:27.720 --> 57:33.480]  or it's a corrupt election once it's a corrupt election the american public can protest in the
[57:33.480 --> 57:39.880]  streets peacefully and refuse to accept the inauguration of hillary clinton we will not
[57:39.880 --> 57:46.360]  accept that so there are many months in between november 8th and january before the time she's
[57:46.360 --> 57:52.920]  inaugurated as a president hopefully she will resign or she becomes sick it's not relevant to us
[57:52.920 --> 57:59.080]  but if obama thinks he can pardon us that will not happen if biden thinks he can co-op that that
[57:59.080 --> 58:05.080]  will not happen what will happen again is either we will call for a reelection with another candidate
[58:05.080 --> 58:11.640]  they pick we will not accept him came he is part of the cia he's part of an unsensible collusion
[58:11.640 --> 58:17.960]  that's occurred we're also asking that john brennan resign because he's been a major source of problems
[58:17.960 --> 58:24.920]  for many many things since 9 11 and onward this is an issue that's come up among the 16 different

[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:42.280]  all these wiki leaks are coming out dr steve pochetic again talking about the soft coup
[01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.640]  that's happening you've got a lot of ambassadors other people concurring what you're saying the
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:52.360]  wiki leaks came from inside the united states not from russia other key points in the five
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:57.160]  minutes we have about the counter coup and the warning to hillary i am seeing a lot of democrats
[01:00:57.160 --> 01:01:03.320]  in the chicago tribune and others on tv exiting from her we're seeing obama cancel a lot of events
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:08.440]  with her and we are seeing some some some movement that looks like they're starting to understand
[01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:14.680]  they bet on the wrong horse i think probably the most important part right now that the president
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:20.680]  obama could do before he leaves office and you know i respect the fact that he served eight years
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:25.320]  and he's done some good there are other things i have a problem with is probably we convince
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:32.840]  hillary clinton to step down i think that would be the most historical and most grandiose plan
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:38.280]  that he's ever done i don't know i know he's not thinking about it but i i suggest to his
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:45.320]  advisers particularly valerie to rat who's an extremely sophisticated woman from chicago
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:52.120]  i knew i knew about her father who's a very great hematologist who worked in iran and worked for
[01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:58.840]  our country that she should talk to him and michelle obama and say look this is not good for our
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:04.200]  country this really we need a peaceful transition and perhaps one of the greatest things that
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.320]  obama could do as the president of the united states he did two things that were very important
[01:02:09.320 --> 01:02:14.920]  turned around the economy and he made us independently independent of oil from the middle east
[01:02:14.920 --> 01:02:21.720]  he doesn't need saudi arabia he really doesn't need to deal with israel as a little spoiled child
[01:02:21.720 --> 01:02:27.880]  the real issue now is that obama can sit down with hillary and tell her luck all bets are off
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:33.480]  whatever i owed you whatever happened i gave you the position of secretary state that i happened to
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:40.120]  know for a fact i won't i won't quote who told me but it was a decision that was made quite frankly
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:47.320]  when i was in the dinner table she was given that position because it was a uh a loss she lost the
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:53.400]  race and she was whining and complaining so they made her secretary state she did very poorly not
[01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:58.040]  just because she didn't know what she was doing but she initiated a lot of problems in libya forget
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:04.040]  the banghazi issue was worse than that and then all the issues that came into syria and iraq so
[01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:09.960]  what i suggest is that the president of the united states his entourage at president susan rice who
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:17.240]  did come forth actually under bill clinton and complained and and protested as i did that bill
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:25.080]  clinton should have prevented the genocide of a million who tune tootsies in the 90s she was
[01:03:25.080 --> 01:03:32.360]  discarded and i asked susan rice and valerita red and michelle obama it's really and i encouraged
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:38.440]  the president united states to allow him to talk to hillary and say look those days are over the
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:45.400]  time is over the american public is very upset whether exactly but we know she's gonna blackout
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:49.640]  arrogant creature with the media still bowler way in trying to steal it what happens i'm not sure
[01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:56.520]  of that and i will tell you why axelrod his advisor came out with very important insights
[01:03:56.520 --> 01:04:03.320]  regarding hillary and there has been bad blood between the clinton's and the obama oh i know obama
[01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:08.440]  hates her i mean she's well but the issue now is you're asking me what can be the most peaceful
[01:04:08.440 --> 01:04:13.720]  denuement to this situation and what i'm suggesting i'm not representing the intelligence community
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:19.560]  now is i'm suggesting that obama is the president of the united states either convince her to step
[01:04:19.560 --> 01:04:25.320]  down ask someone else to replace her not particularly tim cayne he's a political hack
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:32.440]  who works for terry mccullough but someone else and let the race continue or negate the race and
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:38.600]  allow trump to come into the position so we have a peaceful transition the most important thing for
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:43.480]  our community in both the intelligence finance and political all right doc we got to go to break and i
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:47.480]  got pharah coming up and come back and do three more minutes if you can and speaking for the
[01:04:47.480 --> 01:04:52.680]  intelligence community that you've been talking to informally what their message is to hillary and
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:57.160]  obama and the world we come back three more minutes thank you we'll be back and then joseph pharaoh
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:03.880]  stay with us we're read on election day perhaps the biggest election in american history is just
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:08.520]  days away we know that in past elections there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:13.160]  election fraud from dead people voting to people registering false identifications to government
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:17.560]  leaders providing fast-track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes this is happening right
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:22.120]  in front of us now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the republican nominee
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:26.600]  donald trump government chills are campaigning for clinton mainstream news attacking donald trump
[01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:31.320]  all day like rabbit hounds rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics that
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.160]  hillary clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting trump fake
[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:39.960]  celebrities endorsing clinton across all platforms so with all this what are we doing to keep this
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:44.120]  election from being stolen what can we do to prevent election fraud i propose that all
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:48.600]  donald trump supporters wear red on election day on november 8 when you head to the polls to vote
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.480]  donald trump be decked out in red this way just as we dominated in rally turnout we can prove and
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:58.760]  provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout wear red on election day and make america

[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.960]  counter to a wiki leaks when we have the british ambassadors saying he's met with the folks that
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:50.200]  did it they're ready to go public uh because they know that they did the right thing it's not the
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:55.480]  russians what is the other messages that the intelligence community the patriots and what
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:59.880]  percentage would you say the intelligence community is awake of 16 agencies what's their
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:05.000]  message then to hillary and the communist chinese and the saudi arabians that run her like a sock
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:12.280]  puppet the message is very simple i'm talking now on my behalf but you understand i i work informally
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:18.840]  with other people i don't work formally in any way my the message is very simple it's for her to
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:25.080]  stand down she cannot become president of the united states she's not physically mentally
[01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:31.080]  or psychologically or financially capable to maintain the presidency of the united states
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:37.800]  the 16 units will not work with her there will be a major major problem we still have a civilian
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:45.720]  counter coup that will work until she leaves the presidency it's not violent it's not forceful we're
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:51.320]  not going to arrest her that's not any of those issues she knows very well her medical history
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:58.600]  cannot allow her to either lobby for the presidency or maintain any uh capability
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:04.280]  that to stay in the presidency if she does not her targets will be uber avidine peter
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:09.480]  karakchuk a whole bunch of destas there will be all kinds of issues that will be brought up
[01:11:09.480 --> 01:11:15.800]  she will be brought up on charges of bribery interference with an investigation uh lying
[01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:22.840]  to the the public lying to the fbi and the riko charges they will be major those riko charges
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:28.600]  will in fact involve many many people within the clinton campaign and the clinton administration
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:34.120]  and all the all the wall firms including dixie and Shapiro cannot get her out of that hence
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:41.400]  and actually peter katsik may be part of that uh riko charge i can't speak any more on behalf
[01:11:41.400 --> 01:11:46.840]  of what the intelligence community will will not do but you have seen so far how effective they had
[01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:52.840]  been and how they were able to turn around james komi and it was the brave men and women within
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:58.680]  the fbi within this within the other agencies who stepped forward and said they will not accept this
[01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:04.600]  do you know which agency leaked the information to assigned because this is i don't want to i
[01:12:04.600 --> 01:12:10.440]  i don't want to identify it do i know yes do i want to identify it no and the reason for that has to
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:14.840]  do with my longstanding no i understand so so what about the word though if hillary really wants to
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:20.680]  push there's going to be a press conference of a bunch of different agencies well in terms of what
[01:12:20.680 --> 01:12:25.320]  their agency people just coming out saying i you know i released it i leaked it i did it okay well
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:32.200]  that's that's their prerogative but it's i don't want to i do not want to reveal who and no i totally
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:36.360]  understand i totally understand well let me say this will not happen but i do say this two months
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:41.720]  ago where he said this is licensed in concord our country's been overtaken this is important to 1776
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:49.240]  i know i've met michael flin general flin i ike's i admire him amazingly he's he's been very
[01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:53.640]  effective i actually went to one of his meetings where he brought in social scientists he understands
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:13:01.000]  the psychological perspective of of intelligence he's been brilliant in terms of targeting he's
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:06.280]  brilliant in terms of ability to state exactly what the intelligence community can and cannot do
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:12.600]  he's defied all of the other people in the policy areas and he's an unusual man he should be the
[01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:17.720]  directive national intelligence and you probably will become directive national intelligence
[01:13:17.720 --> 01:13:23.640]  but michael flin represents only a small part of a much broader group of people who i can tell you
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:28.440]  come from all backgrounds in the 16 different no i understand this is a historic moment as you said
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:33.640]  one of the biggest history this is the second american revolution i wrote about it in a maximum
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:39.480]  village of vigilance i wrote about a coup 20 years ago in maximum vigilance against the president
[01:13:39.480 --> 01:13:44.840]  of the united states it was not only a hard coup it was a soft coup and what we're talking about now
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:51.480]  but the american public has to understand this is really a change and a revolution in the internet
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:58.920]  age and alex jones and matt drudge and all the others lewdogs and fox has been a part of this
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.760]  coup because it's been it's occurring on the internet and in on the binary numbers in the
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:09.480]  and it's not violent steve pacinic dot com we're having you on for an hour friday thanks for all
[01:14:09.480 --> 01:14:14.200]  your time i think it's my pleasure and god bless your audience will you and thank you alex amazing
[01:14:14.200 --> 01:14:18.120]  okay wow uh and again speaking of the internet revolution joseph ferro though there goes steve
[01:14:18.120 --> 01:14:22.600]  pacinic uh amazing uh he wants i was just talking to ferro during the break of my producer was he
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:27.800]  wants to get into this very subject and talk about wiki leaks the election how big this is uh hard
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:33.640]  got to get on wnd.com world net daily uh with publishing and films and not just print and
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:38.840]  the western journalism system uh center i could tell you if it wasn't for joseph ferro uh you
[01:14:38.840 --> 01:14:43.640]  wouldn't have what we have today so we really owe you for that joseph what an epic time to be alive
[01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:49.160]  my friend what do you make of all this well he's talking about twos that was a pretty big two getting
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:54.440]  that previous guest there alex i think that kind he's kind of the man of the hour right now putting
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:15:00.680]  all this in perspective and i couldn't agree more uh with them that you know we're we're in the myth
[01:15:00.680 --> 01:15:09.720]  of a coup here in a counter coup the stakes could not be higher and this election uh literally i mean
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:16.840]  think about it alex uh hillary clinton if she doesn't win she's probably going to jail okay
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:23.000]  she's got more motivation she's got nothing to lose yeah exactly i mean you know trump loses you
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:29.880]  know he's still a billionaire he's still free but this is how and and of course even for the rest
[01:15:29.880 --> 01:15:35.960]  of us the stakes are even higher because we actually uh you know if we want to maintain any
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:42.120]  semblance of liberty in this country we better hope for the right outcome of this and this election
[01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:49.000]  and and that and that means a victory by trump uh and i you know i like what you had to say this
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:55.240]  is lexington and conquered uh you know let's hope no shots have to be fired i'm not advocating that
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:02.040]  i'm hopeful for a peaceful transition of power here you know the polls are looking better but
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:06.920]  you know hillary's like a wounded animal out there right now facing what she's going to face
[01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:14.040]  if she does not win i mean they're going to be pulling out all the stops i can't imagine she's
[01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:19.080]  going to just walk away uh what is front and center on your plate i could ask plenty of questions
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:23.880]  but joseph farrah the center of wnd.com one of the top news sites in the world i mean you know
[01:16:23.880 --> 01:16:28.200]  you're 100 something on the web we're 100 something on the web i mean we're exploding
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:31.720]  drivers exploding that's got to freak them out they're not going to let us just continue to operate
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:37.960]  they admit they're coming after us well exactly and you know i mean taking the internet of controls
[01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:44.760]  of of our of our countries uh our country and putting it into some kind of a global new world
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:50.840]  order may be the first step we haven't seen any impact of that yet but you know it's there
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:55.000]  do you remember being on like alan the limb 20 years ago talking about global government
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.360]  un gun control now they just admit it all it's like they've just validated everything we ever said
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:08.920]  absolutely and uh you know this this wikileaks thing alex is the treasure trove we now have
[01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:15.320]  so much visibility into the way they think the way they operate i mean you do imagine if we had
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:20.200]  this 20 years ago we made our job so much easier we have the blueprint of how these crooks operate
[01:17:20.200 --> 01:17:27.560]  absolutely uh and you know what we're one of one of the things that you know has appeared appeared
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:34.920]  to me so obvious now is that they the way they work with what i call the controlled uh opposition
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:40.200]  the republican establishment and so forth when you read between the lines of what hillary's saying
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:45.000]  and what the bloom and thawler's saying and people like that in these in you know and what they think
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.160]  are just a confidential correspondence i mean they have they have nothing but contempt for
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:57.720]  these people but at the same time they know they're facing they were facing no opposition from from
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:04.840]  the vainers and the mcconnells and those people and they use them uh so effectively for years
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:12.280]  and and the latest veritas talking bad about black people they're so hateful i mean who in emails
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:16.760]  and videos talks like this and then i thought i'm running my own operation in my own life and i'm
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:22.680]  pretty hard working 18 hours a day a lot of days yesterday like 16 the control freak of how they
[01:18:22.680 --> 01:18:27.560]  manipulate media newspapers and hillary's staff running you know dozens of i mean you've you've
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:31.240]  run major newspapers that's hard enough that'll give you a heart attack how the hell do they have
[01:18:31.240 --> 01:18:39.880]  such criminal energy joseph well maybe there's a spiritual angle to it you know yeah maybe they
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:47.400]  got a four a powerful force behind them i i don't know i mean i'm not i'm half joking only but you
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:53.800]  know what we've seen in terms of the criminality uh that we're seeing uh from the clinton machine at
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:19:01.880]  the end the all of them uh it it really is pure evil i mean i mean i totally agree with you
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:05.640]  because as a media guy and you're a bigger media guy than i am managing more things
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:10.200]  we know how hard this is how do they do it where it's like literally they're running
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:14.920]  the networks media they're ordering everything they're proofreading they're editing they're
[01:19:14.920 --> 01:19:20.120]  i'm actually envious of the energy i am blown away by the i don't know anyone this with this
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:26.120]  type of demonic energy well one they do have a couple of advantages obvious advantages
[01:19:26.120 --> 01:19:31.240]  when you know they're in the side government they have virtually unlimited resources there
[01:19:31.240 --> 01:19:36.520]  and of course they um you know that they need more money they go to Saudi Arabia
[01:19:36.520 --> 01:19:42.120]  and they do their bidding for them and uh you know ultimately i think that is what this uh
[01:19:42.120 --> 01:19:49.640]  this coup is all about uh and if you if you read these wiki leaks emails like i have it just confirms
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:56.760]  that you know a big part of what hillary was doing as secretary of state was allowing the
[01:19:56.760 --> 01:20:02.040]  Saudis to basically run the show i was about to say it shocks me it shocks me i knew they were
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:07.080]  powerful but it's like she represents the Saudis the Chinese you don't hear about Merkel you don't
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:12.200]  hear about uh Benjamin Netanyahu you don't hear about the canadian prime minister it's all Saudi
[01:20:12.200 --> 01:20:18.360]  and Chinese right and you know that's where the money is you know uh and that's where that's who
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:23.080]  who seeks our influence that we do you know we've done their bidding for so long but when you
[01:20:23.080 --> 01:20:29.880]  took analyze this arab spring and what happened arab spring what a joke uh i'm this chaos in the
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:37.880]  middle east that we see today it seems to be a direct result of Saudi Arabia calling the shot
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:44.600]  u.s military uh you know doing their bidding for them and uh and and there's and the chaos that
[01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:52.680]  we see the carnage that we see Syria libya they try to Egypt uh and you know this is what this
[01:20:52.680 --> 01:20:57.640]  is what you get when you when you listen to the Saudis and do their bidding and they and all you
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:02.840]  get for it if you're Hillary Clinton there's maybe a couple 100 million in your Clinton foundation
[01:21:02.840 --> 01:21:06.920]  at the end i was about to say looking at the thousands of emails where Saudi Arabia is calling
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:11.320]  the shots in the arab spring from north africa to the middle east that's finally what made the
[01:21:11.320 --> 01:21:16.520]  military break with them because congress wouldn't do it the people wouldn't do it and start leaking
[01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:21.400]  info about Benghazi and Syria and general flin who i keep bringing up because he was the guy to
[01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:25.560]  you know go out and say Hillary's running al-qaeda and ices and then you read the emails it's really
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:32.360]  true what type of evil person sides with radical Islam to go into countries and kill hundreds of
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:37.320]  thousands of Christians like Syria and then have obama say oh we're not we're going to let equal
[01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:42.520]  people out then we learn he's not letting christians out i mean that is why are they so anti-christian
[01:21:43.720 --> 01:21:48.920]  well because i guess the christians don't have the money listen i really think at the end of the
[01:21:48.920 --> 01:21:55.480]  day what the clinton's are about is getting their share you know getting their share it's what they
[01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:00.280]  you know we saw evidence of this in the 90s but when they built the clinton foundation they felt
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:07.720]  they had a way around it you know and she used the secretary of state's office to shake down foreign
[01:22:07.720 --> 01:22:13.320]  money left and right you're absolutely right that's it i mean the now we learn the state department
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.800]  you name it they steal the furniture and plates everywhere not just the white house that goes to
[01:22:17.800 --> 01:22:23.000]  their i meant to ask patenik is your psychiatrist what does that say about somebody that if they're
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:28.760]  at dinner at your house they'll try to steal something i mean steal a silver absolutely i mean
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:35.400]  by the way there was a small story recently when she left the state department she stole stuff
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:41.560]  furniture yeah i mean when she dated at the white house she did at the state department so you know
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:47.720]  this is almost like an addiction these people have in a sense of entitlement uh to everything that
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:52.520]  the taxpayers have you know put in front of them wow well i've been asking some of the questions
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:56.760]  here he brought up wikileaks i was questioning assange i said if he's bipartisan later i'll
[01:22:56.760 --> 01:23:00.440]  like him i want to see what he do because i wasn't fan of bush near with you but now they've really
[01:23:00.440 --> 01:23:05.880]  proven himself to be a hero and now i know from high level folks not just patenik that clearly
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:11.320]  this came from us intelligence so i've got to say we need to see him pardoned at the end of all this
[01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:19.480]  uh i hope so you know again back to this story thing i just think that um it's becoming more
[01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:27.880]  evident uh with every leak uh you know what your previous guest just said uh that you know the
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:35.000]  clitons would do anything for anybody you ask well you know why would uh how would they get to
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:41.160]  that position here's a better question for you how do you as a democratic presidential candidate
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:48.040]  then sell to the american people to this liberal constituency that is apparently still going to
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:56.040]  vote for uh hillary working with you know this corrupt regime this uh you know the people they
[01:23:56.040 --> 01:24:02.360]  kill gays women don't have any rights in this country and yet you know the media let them get
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:07.400]  away with exactly unbelievable let me ask you this then whether hillary steals it or not i think
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:11.640]  trump's gonna win the evidence shows that but i want your view on it josephairofworldentdaily.com
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:16.680]  wd.com what happens if she steals it and gets in but then all the wiki leaks are there and asan
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:21.080]  says more is going to come after she'll have to pardon herself i mean it's just not a total
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:27.240]  destruction by them their own hands a self-immolation of mainstream media and the so-called liberals
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:30.520]  because the liberals have always had their problems there's been a wide spectrum of them
[01:24:30.520 --> 01:24:35.640]  but they've totally turned their back even on what they claim they stand for that's right and you
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:41.080]  know hillary keeps talking about this this thing with the fbi being unprecedented and what is
[01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:50.120]  unprecedented is having a presidential candidate twice being subject of fbi investigation during
[01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:55.960]  her campaign that's what's unprecedented and and the reason it's unprecedented is it's unprecedented
[01:24:55.960 --> 01:25:03.960]  that we have a criminal just an out and out criminal running for president and i am optimistic
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:09.480]  about this election and you know how can you not be after seeing the turnaround in the polls over
[01:25:09.480 --> 01:25:16.200]  the last week or so i mean i was pretty morose there for a while looking at this uh also hoping
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:22.760]  that you know the polls were wrong fixed break whatever you want to say but you know i i believe
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:29.000]  there was you know some truth in it we look at it today it is completely turned around you know
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:36.520]  it's a very very close election according to all the polls i'm seeing a lot of you know what uh i
[01:25:36.520 --> 01:25:42.360]  remember back in 1980 i was still around you were just probably maybe you weren't even born yet
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:47.800]  i was around okay now my dad was taking me to reagan rallies in dallas i was like five years old
[01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:53.080]  you know if you remember what happened there was that the independence started breaking
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:57.480]  toward reagan uh in the last week it was only the last week reagan was 10 points behind the last
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:03.240]  week yeah and you know pat caddell himself who was carter's pollster said boy this race looks
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:07.960]  a whole lot like 19 well he said he said yeah three days ago hillary is collapsing right now
[01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:15.320]  so look i'm i'm hopeful trumps gonna win i'm even more hopeful that trumps gonna win big i think
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:21.640]  that would be very important because our country is in a very fragile state right now very divided
[01:26:21.640 --> 01:26:26.760]  and you know we've got to pull it together uh we've got to get back to you know the constitution
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:32.760]  and the principles of liberty that made this country great i think trump might be just the
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:39.880]  you know the perfect guy to stir that drink right now and uh so you know we got to hope and pray uh
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:47.960]  for the next five days that this thing uh becomes uh even more clear uh in terms of a victory for
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:53.000]  trump i agree there has to be a landslide because you got sorrows with 16 states voting machines
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:56.760]  bev harris who's totally bipartisan meets the liberal she goes oh they're trying to show it
[01:26:56.760 --> 01:27:01.400]  for hillary she said undoubtedly and then we found this this fraction shaving thing that they're
[01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:07.240]  doing i mean if if the democrats are crazy enough to steal this for hillary they're nuts because
[01:27:07.240 --> 01:27:14.120]  they're adding as i said 9 12 14 15 20 points more and over sampling for their methodology claiming
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:18.520]  there's more democrats or whatever they didn't do that before and still trumps winning by six
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:24.920]  points those polls wow that looks like a landslide yeah but you know it may be their last chance to
[01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:31.400]  steal it because if they do uh you know it may be our last chance to even have any kind of a
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:35.400]  semblance of a free election i agree with you they always say every election is the biggest ever
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.920]  but this is hands down undoubtedly the biggest ever of your life oh yeah we can look back at
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:46.520]  2012 and 2008 and you know we we had our scary conversations back in those days too but at the
[01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:52.040]  end of the day there is simply no comparison i've got a lot of personal experience with
[01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:58.360]  hillary clinton you know i i think i told you a alex once before maybe that you know i really
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:05.640]  didn't fear the eight years of barack obama in terms of you know personal safety personal
[01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:12.680]  victimization yeah he voted in my taxes every year but there was something much scarier i have
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:18.440]  to tell you for those of us who were you know in opposition i had men beat me up in a parking lot
[01:28:18.440 --> 01:28:22.360]  when i was not even that big 18 years ago saying show up about the clinton's i've been believing
[01:28:22.360 --> 01:28:29.480]  no the clinton's are vindictive yeah a lot of there's a lot of bodies you know buried uh we didn't
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:35.560]  see that in in the open i mean there were a lot of carnage in the middle east during obama's years
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:39.720]  but uh not so much in terms i'll say this i bashed bush nothing ever happened to me
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:44.040]  i mean i was a huge detractor because i was trying to be you know bipartisan about my attacks but
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:50.840]  i gotta say even liberals like jonathan turley uh who are lawyers say obama's you know far worse
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:56.040]  and they're saying hillary will be far worse than bush i mean it's just a nightmare it shows a fairy

[01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:45.480]  leadership is these people are historically dangerous historically evil and they must be stopped
[01:29:46.040 --> 01:29:51.880]  and we're now five days out i mean it's just the energy is epic we're on the march the empires on
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:30:02.920]  the run alex jones and the gcn radio network we have an article up on our website written by
[01:30:02.920 --> 01:30:08.360]  paul joseph watson details a former british ambassador saying hey john pedesta the email
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:13.480]  leak was done by a washington insider not russians well that's pretty obvious you should look to
[01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:18.120]  washington and not to mosco i'm talking about british ambassador craig murray who says the
[01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:22.360]  source of the john pedesta email leak was a washington insider and not the russians as the
[01:30:22.360 --> 01:30:27.560]  clinton camp would like us all to believe he says quote the source of these emails and leaks has
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:31.640]  nothing to do with russia at all i discovered what the source was when i attended the sam
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:37.240]  adam's whistleblower award in washington he then goes on to blast the narrative that wiki leaks
[01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:41.960]  is a conduit for russia by asserting that the claims are designed to divert attention from
[01:30:41.960 --> 01:30:47.400]  their content and material well said craig murray and it goes hand in hand with the narrative that
[01:30:47.400 --> 01:30:52.120]  the democrats are so desperate that i didn't even realize how absurd it sounds to blame the kgp
[01:30:52.120 --> 01:30:56.760]  for hijacking our democracy i'm margaret hell reporting for info wars dot com

[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:21.960]  international forces bent on global governance when i was a boy it was okay to be proud of the flag

[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:37.160]  revelation dawn of global government we're the solution americans ain't nothing more to it than
[01:32:37.160 --> 01:32:43.400]  that star in alex jones charlie daniels and special ops general jerry boykin theatrical

[01:32:49.960 --> 01:32:59.240]  revelation the movie dot info americans need to see this film revelation the movie dot info let's fix it
[01:33:01.480 --> 01:33:07.880]  the bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order it must
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:15.000]  be followed there's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:21.080]  for launching nuclear weapons to do so as president i will make it clear that the united
[01:33:21.080 --> 01:33:27.320]  states will treat cyber attacks just like any other attack we will be ready with serious
[01:33:27.320 --> 01:33:33.720]  political economic and military responses they're voting for peace on planet earth if they vote for
[01:33:33.720 --> 01:33:43.560]  trump but if they vote for hillary it's war we came we saw he died with her you'll end up in
[01:33:43.560 --> 01:33:49.080]  world war three i want the iranians to know that if i'm the president we will attack iran right now
[01:33:49.080 --> 01:33:55.960]  senator for us to control all of the airspace in syria would require us to go to war against syria
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:34:04.120]  and russia the u.s. military has just raised the threat level to def con too meanwhile hillary clinton
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:10.680]  is still threatening russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further hacking
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:15.160]  it's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions of course not because she's a
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:21.880]  really loud noise all right looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:31.800]  we'll try to get leanne back on in a few minutes when the president gives the order it must be
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:44.280]  followed
[01:34:44.280 --> 01:34:50.840]  merv misses into the atmosphere delivering second third and fourth strikes the trendies now have
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:56.520]  what they wanted they hated the world and give them to them they wanted to piss on it and they did
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:35:03.480]  it vote like the world depends on a november 8th you know i want to open the phones up now and play
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:12.360]  a few clips before our next guest joins us it's 800-25-99231 800-25-99231 i'd like to hear from
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:16.680]  military personnel i'd like to hear from police officers i'd like to hear from retired intelligence
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:20.760]  folks uh but if other people want to call in that's fine too but i'd like to get your view
[01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:25.800]  on the state of the world when you see donald trump up there saying we've been taken over by
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:30.360]  foreign banks and globalists and the chinese you've got the former head of defense intelligence
[01:35:30.360 --> 01:35:34.520]  living saying yes this has happened and you've got all these other former spy chiefs and people
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:39.400]  coming out saying we've been overtaken it's because things have gotten so bad they have to do it
[01:35:40.280 --> 01:35:45.160]  and trump as i told you two years ago months before he got drafted or two and a half years ago
[01:35:45.160 --> 01:35:52.040]  about six eight months before he went public he was approached so were other people and said would
[01:35:52.040 --> 01:35:58.440]  you do this and he made the decision not to do it and then more information came out about
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:05.560]  Benghazi and other things he said okay i'm gonna do it and they psychologically profiled him knowing
[01:36:05.560 --> 01:36:10.360]  he was a good guy but also the fact that he's unsuable doesn't care what you say about him
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:18.600]  and has a penchant for america has a soft spot he was recruited and that's why the whole world's
[01:36:18.600 --> 01:36:26.920]  attacking and only the biggest idiot wouldn't support trump i mean the whole world is attacking him
[01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:34.200]  and attacking us because china brags are taking over hollywood and i get pacenic going hollywood's
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:40.520]  finished so what when pacenics put out some big movies he's done movies with paris and ford
[01:36:41.800 --> 01:36:45.560]  and pacenic owns good-sized companies pacenics is a successful guy
[01:36:45.560 --> 01:36:49.880]  um he's going public now i'm showing his face
[01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:59.000]  because we have to spur other people to show their faces now we have to go all in at this
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:02.840]  point because here's the deal hillary doesn't just want to run stuff so she's in charge
[01:37:04.760 --> 01:37:08.760]  she'd go out of her way to represent child molesters and criminals and bank robbers
[01:37:09.320 --> 01:37:13.640]  and she loved them she liked them she likes filth she's a nasty person
[01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:23.400]  she doesn't like good strong honorable people and there's new new veritas stuff man i told people
[01:37:23.400 --> 01:37:26.760]  this all i could do is tell the truth sometimes my own detriment you know what i do it
[01:37:29.160 --> 01:37:31.560]  the only time i've ever heard racists talk is around democrats
[01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:36.520]  the weirdest thing about it is the black democrats talk crap about black people
[01:37:38.760 --> 01:37:40.040]  but it's an elitism
[01:37:40.040 --> 01:37:46.840]  whereas i see somebody not doing well i feel guilty and bad want to build them up
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:51.000]  and they know we're like that so they manipulate good people and say oh you
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:54.440]  ought to be guilty do what we say but i gotta realize no i'm actually not guilty i didn't do this
[01:37:54.440 --> 01:37:58.280]  stop trying to guilt me when you're the ones in your own memos that want to make people poor
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.400]  that's the difference trump doesn't want to make you poor
[01:38:03.480 --> 01:38:04.360]  is he a maniac
[01:38:04.360 --> 01:38:09.160]  who else are you gonna get to go up against these people i'm a maniac
[01:38:12.200 --> 01:38:19.880]  when i'm threatened i don't run i attack and it's not it's not some moral issue either it's
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:30.600]  just what i do because that's what i do and america needs to stop running america needs to
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:35.480]  open its eyes and understand what's happening and feel the level of historic energy that's
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:41.080]  taking place and say no to all this now a few clips i want to play uh just backing up that there is
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:46.680]  a soft coup going on and we do have william benning coming up the next few days don't we former
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:54.840]  technical director of the united states he's on friday the chenex on friday again and we have the
[01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:59.080]  british ambassador coming out and saying look i was at a major meeting in the united states and he
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:06.440]  listed now they came folks that did it came up and told me now that's a big secret it's not a secret
[01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:15.640]  that seven years ago the solicitor general of national security went to congress and then the
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:24.920]  national archives did too and said hillary's doing illegal stuff and nothing got done so of
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:31.960]  course this came from western intelligence and umma abedin the evidence is now mounting
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:36.440]  the things they know they have to parallel i'm not defending this is just the world we're in
[01:39:36.440 --> 01:39:42.040]  they have to parallel construct now the stuff that's already known okay but hillary
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:50.600]  isn't just a triple agent to the chinese she has totally adopted it and is following their
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:55.880]  edict and believes that's where she can even run and then she's on the payroll of the of the
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:01.720]  lohabist and has been penetrated literally and figuratively by umma abedin and
[01:40:05.640 --> 01:40:13.000]  it's just it's unbelievable and i look at the sniveling dumb weak soft liberals who don't know
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:19.160]  geopolitics they couldn't name all seven continents they don't know and they sit there and look at me
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:27.000]  and make jokes tin foil hat oh hadn't heard that 50 000 times oh kook oh wow wow conspiracy there is
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:33.960]  wow you're so intellectual you're so smart you've got two or three worthless college degrees
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:42.840]  all i do study this stuff i've had them try to buy me off 10 million dollars a year you would fall
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:48.680]  on your face before that dumbass and you sit here and look at me and tell me i'm not real
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:54.920]  when i've been through all this and i realize i'm nothing special i'm just a red blooded american
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:41:00.760]  you though are low see something i'm good it's that you are low you are pathetic and no wonder
[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:05.160]  you want to keep people down no wonder you want a system that's based on keeping stuff small and
[01:41:05.160 --> 01:41:09.320]  you don't want competition and you don't because you're afraid of it you don't like it
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:19.480]  i've got your modus operandi and i am i'm not a person that wants to be dominant or being charged
[01:41:19.480 --> 01:41:23.880]  but i'll tell you one thing you're not going to be in charge of me how about that i don't want
[01:41:23.880 --> 01:41:31.080]  status but i'll do anything to keep you from running my life you understand and i see how pathetic you
[01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:36.920]  are and how scared you are and how evil you are and you are you're the opposite of liberal you are
[01:41:36.920 --> 01:41:45.640]  the simpering trendy fake people who are the biggest losers abused by yourself i've got a 200
[01:41:45.640 --> 01:41:51.720]  square foot apartment that i pay what a thousand foot should be i'm so cool i got ripped off by
[01:41:51.720 --> 01:42:07.400]  some local scumbag landlord globalist i'm so cool you're delusional and it's because your parents
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:10.600]  broke up when you were a little kid on average i'm not saying it's bad a lot of people are great
[01:42:10.600 --> 01:42:15.640]  that i happen to but i'm just giving them oh and you you you brought up by tv you were brought up in
[01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:20.280]  fantasy land you were brought up by nicolodian and mtv and you're not a real person your brain's
[01:42:20.280 --> 01:42:25.000]  too a third smaller than it should be you weren't breastfed and i just got to realize you're a victim
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:30.600]  and i'll be so angry at you but it's just i see that little satanic look in your eye that that dull
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:36.520]  light and i just think man you really want to get run over don't you you really want to pick a fight
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:43.560]  the little pulleys against the humans you really want to go there because once the veneer peels back
[01:42:43.560 --> 01:42:52.120]  it's game time you think we're afraid of you we're afraid of ourselves you have no idea what's one
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:59.800]  inch away from you right now you keep pushing and pushing and pushing you're gonna open up something
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:08.200]  you don't want to get old enough i want to defeat the big powerful globalist
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:17.640]  i don't want to have to run over you people but i'd like to see you wake up and stop being
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:21.000]  a damn coward and i'm not talking to our audience i want to be clear about that
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:28.600]  when i see these lion hit pieces where they quote me they now quote us and i just tell
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:33.640]  audience they know this they quote us and say stuff we never even said now they don't just
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:40.440]  cobble stuff together they just whole cloth make up the most bat crazy crap you could imagine
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:48.760]  and then i see like where it'll be in one day like 20 30 newspapers the exact same article
[01:43:48.760 --> 01:43:53.480]  kind of scrambled with people's names and i google the writer's names a lot of times they
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:57.880]  don't even exist and i'm like oh my god they announced it five years ago that's a fake robot
[01:43:57.880 --> 01:44:02.680]  writing that where they one guy writes it puts it in and then it creates all these pen names
[01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:07.000]  who don't pay the writers they're even cutting the idiot writers out right now and telling them
[01:44:07.000 --> 01:44:10.040]  it's because there's a collapse in the news media but most of it's because they're just getting rid
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:15.000]  of you because they got robots they don't need you but the little guys that still have the jobs
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:18.920]  in media they don't care they're part of the establishment they're in fantasy land they don't
[01:44:18.920 --> 01:44:23.400]  even have self-preservation they don't even care they're just delusional one minute to the next
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:26.360]  as long as they tell themselves they're a winner they think they are when you're not
[01:44:26.360 --> 01:44:35.240]  and that's why nanny state tries to keep us in the dark it's why they try to keep us weak
[01:44:36.120 --> 01:44:39.880]  is because they don't want any rites of passage anybody to ever be put through real pressure
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:45.960]  because then you're designed to actually grow up and become strong
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:50.520]  they just want these fantasy filled cowards i'm gonna go to your phone calls briefly here

[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:00.520]  okay i want to go to your calls let me play a few of these clips because i mentioned
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:07.960]  uh that i would do that we're mentioning the fact that the the hack happened here in the
[01:46:07.960 --> 01:46:13.800]  united states and it wasn't a hack they used the big nsa spy grid against the very politicians
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:17.880]  that set it up and had it doing illegal things and william benny said this first like six months
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:23.720]  ago on the show here then he said it uh and now he's basically said no it is well the british
[01:46:23.720 --> 01:46:30.040]  ambassador there's a short clip said look i was at a meeting getting a award for free speech
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:35.880]  and a whistleblower award and it came out and i talked to folks that did it uh so let's go ahead
[01:46:35.880 --> 01:46:41.640]  and play that clip um and we got gaudy smacking down msnbc attempt to distract from clinton with russia
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:46.200]  question if you ask about said no connections let me give you a news flash about trump
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:53.000]  trump doesn't use email that's why whenever they played the veritas clips he said during the debate
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:57.400]  you know i saw the clips i've been told how he gets his news by multiple people in the staff
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:01.880]  they come in with clips of what they think is important and they print out articles from the
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:07.640]  internet and then he reads them in in paper files and the only thing he does internet is on his phone
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:13.480]  he does twitter but he usually doesn't like the phone he dictates to a secretary that walks beside
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:17.240]  him and i'm kind of i kind of like having a throwback like this but here's the old
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:23.080]  you look at photos of his office it's all just papers and files trump doesn't use the internet
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:28.600]  he doesn't talk to anybody other than in person he's it doesn't know anything about russia
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:33.880]  other than he talks to top generals is russia attacking us and they know sir no sir the threats
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:38.200]  china and then the muslims well why are we with them then well sir we've been sold out to him well
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:43.080]  that's it i'm not gonna it's real simple is is russia doing something to us no he said if russia
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:47.240]  was to overflow our planes or our ships again in scare we'll shoot him down i'm gonna tell put
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:52.680]  let me tell you the problem is he will iranian patrol boats come around our ships they're dead
[01:47:52.680 --> 01:47:56.680]  folks everybody's gonna be like whoa here's the difference you don't mess with us there's not gonna
[01:47:56.680 --> 01:48:03.720]  be a problem and russia gets that and they hear oh you you don't want to have a war with us you
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:07.400]  don't want to you're gonna leave us alone yeah i'm gonna go back to the deal we had in the 90s
[01:48:07.400 --> 01:48:10.760]  that you don't expand we don't expand on you russia's like wonderful please
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:17.560]  but that's the them pushing this is just the height of bs ladies and gentlemen
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:23.240]  every person he's got advising him is about china eating our lunch
[01:48:23.240 --> 01:48:30.360]  and trump is his business guy cannot stand that he can't wait can't wait to see you
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:34.920]  with your taxes cut and money flowing in and he's gonna be the hero he wants to be the hero
[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:39.640]  that's who we want so wild man that wants to be the hero and wants to be the guy with all the wealth
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:44.520]  and everybody's loving him not a little creep like hillary wants you poor under her control
[01:48:44.520 --> 01:48:46.760]  she's a devil folks that's what the devil wants
[01:48:46.760 --> 01:48:55.240]  so let's go ahead and i mentioned the british ambassador let's go ahead and play that club
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:49:01.320]  craig murray here it is do you think wiki leaks received their emails from the russian government
[01:49:01.320 --> 01:49:05.480]  to the accusations regarding that russian government involvement is accurate this is
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:11.240]  absolutely untrue the source of these leaks these emails has nothing to do with russia at all i
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:17.960]  discovered what the source was when i attended the sam adams whistleblower award in uh washington
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:22.680]  which i was cheering a couple of months ago and the source of these emails comes down within
[01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:27.960]  official circles in washington dc you should look to washington and not to mosco for the source of
[01:49:27.960 --> 01:49:32.360]  these emails absolutely he was there okay let's go to another one the hillary takeover let's go
[01:49:32.360 --> 01:49:38.360]  to bill benny former head of technical nsa saying the same thing here it is wow well i wish i would
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:41.960]  have asked the big question but i'd like you to get back into it and flesh it out for us today

[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:53.720]  guy that designed most of it uh that indeed they do have all of hillary's deleted 33 000 emails william
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:50:02.680]  benny you know it's it's not really that they've hacked into the server or the dnc server or
[01:50:02.680 --> 01:50:08.760]  hillary server it's they've got they've got over in the united states in the fairview program they

[01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:18.520]  us army patron of a person sitting up to qualify that daria incredible stuff putin's coming coming
[01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:23.960]  out with coming up in the next hour we have putin warning european countries have no future if they
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:29.320]  continue to accept migrants which is just a fact because they don't accept culture they're islamic
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:34.840]  you take folks from brazil or mexico they're western they they they at least you know are able
[01:54:34.840 --> 01:54:41.080]  to assimilate until the leftists get them but not the case with islamicist uh so we've got that
[01:54:41.080 --> 01:54:45.000]  and we got a bunch of other clips from putin just saying amazing things they're going to be big
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:50.200]  news stories once we put them out because nobody seems to translate this that's coming up uh we've
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:55.400]  got just a massive amount of news and info wars dot com by the way according to all the big web
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:55:01.320]  rating agencies that are out there info wars dot com is now in the top 200 sites on the web
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:07.400]  now to give you an idea that drudge is like 40 or something which is just huge uh we now uh are
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:12.920]  just absolutely gigantic according to uh the different agencies that are out there we're
[01:55:12.920 --> 01:55:18.280]  putting some of this uh on screen for folks i was looking at it earlier i could see the number
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:25.640]  what are we ranked at right there uh 202 in the us so that's continuing to drop though and i'm not
[01:55:25.640 --> 01:55:29.640]  even sure that we have everything set where they can scan our site properly because i know our
[01:55:29.640 --> 01:55:33.960]  traffic is much better than what they even say plus info wars quite frankly is a small part of what
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:40.360]  we do you count youtube and facebook everything else uh i'd say info wars is 20 of our traffic
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:46.200]  is what we actually get so info wars is super dominant there's nothing out there that even
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:50.760]  you know it rivals us in mainstream media they admit that only thing bigger is drudge report
[01:55:50.760 --> 01:55:56.280]  dot com which shows we're really the mainstream if we're what's dominant we've now reached that point
[01:55:57.080 --> 01:56:01.400]  so there you go not bragging just fact to let you know you're not alone you're not the minority
[01:56:01.400 --> 01:56:07.720]  you're not a cook the mainstream media is there to make you feel alone okay we got steve and john

[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:55.480]  to go through some legal channels if she does steal it and it's going to take some time well
[01:56:55.480 --> 01:57:01.000]  that's what dr pacenic said that's what farrah said she's a cornered rat she's gonna go to jail

[01:57:06.360 --> 01:57:12.440]  it's like spock when he had to prepare spock to hillary like a hero to her and you know fictitious
[01:57:12.440 --> 01:57:17.400]  hero but still a hero in the reactor in ratha con they say hey he's dead already we can't save him
[01:57:17.400 --> 01:57:22.360]  she's already politically done now the only question is can she blow the world up before she's done

[01:57:58.680 --> 01:58:02.680]  was a moment though when she was talking to an undecided voter and i think she's run into him
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:08.520]  before which i truly think he was undecided but when she mentioned why why does he get
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:12.280]  why don't they get money for the big speeches and he said well they're worth it but why aren't
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:18.520]  there anybody here when it's free and his the look on his face was just i think it's one of the

[02:00:59.240 --> 02:01:03.720]  extremely powerful that nobody else is covering in the next segment then the northeast intelligence
[02:01:03.720 --> 02:01:08.520]  network is going to join us mr hagman right now a great point from the earlier caller uh what he
[02:01:08.520 --> 02:01:12.360]  was bringing up they're going to contest this election that's now admitted story on info wars.com
[02:01:12.360 --> 02:01:16.360]  hillary says she's going to contest if she loses but trump isn't allowed to contest if he loses
[02:01:16.360 --> 02:01:24.360]  that's the double think la la land uh two-year-old land we're engaged in uh let's go ahead and talk
[02:01:24.360 --> 02:01:31.000]  to clay in indiana you're on the air hey alex how you doing good brother i was uh i was with
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:35.480]  you in cleveland when uh the communists attacked you um i've been following you guys 2008 grade
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:40.440]  i had two points i wanted to make number one um i had a conversation with some left-wing
[02:01:40.440 --> 02:01:45.640]  nut job the other day and he was trying to explain me that the project barrett talks videos um have
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:50.360]  been edited and distorted and the level of mind control these people are under to seriously say
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:55.480]  that they've been edited oh that's the talking point they say it's edited and then they say
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:02:00.280]  he's a criminal yeah basically trespassing in a federal building to show that the phones weren't
[02:02:00.280 --> 02:02:06.120]  broken when they said the guy's a hero it but but but again they admit that the videos aren't edited
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:10.680]  this is what they did well and the thing about it is that he's looking at me and i it literally
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:15.720]  sounds like it's don liman or wolf blitzer speaking to me not him i mean it's literally seeing in spewing
[02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:19.560]  out of his mouth he has no original thought this is the level of of the people though that we're
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:25.160]  dealing with on a daily basis and yeah they're called delusional they think if they buy into a lie
[02:02:25.160 --> 02:02:30.280]  there's somehow with the power structure when they're the chumps exactly exactly and my number
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:34.440]  two point i wanted to make was okay so so there's there's there's going to be two responses that
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:40.040]  are going to happen um hillary when uh there is no way somebody like me or you are going to sit back
[02:02:40.040 --> 02:02:43.880]  and let this happen i mean i'm not calling for violence but this is we're not going to let it
[02:02:43.880 --> 02:02:47.000]  happen the patriots who have woken up no no no we're not calling for violence they say they're
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:51.080]  coming after us so if they think wiki leagues everything we've done is powerful so far and
[02:02:51.080 --> 02:02:56.520]  airplanes in the sky with bill clinton's a rapist get ready folks we haven't even begun to flip the
[02:02:56.520 --> 02:03:02.200]  switches of escalation they escalate their threat to us we escalate right back oh really you want
[02:03:02.200 --> 02:03:07.400]  to escalate we got a lot more switches than you do they're going to find out that's the beauty of
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:12.200]  donald trump is that is that it's not it's not the man himself donald trump it's the movement
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:15.720]  behind it and i'm not even voting against hillary clinton it's the washington corruption in general
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:20.360]  she just represents a small look the russians are savvy they know they penetrated hillary
[02:03:20.360 --> 02:03:23.880]  they know she was selling us out they don't want to have to spend everything on military they don't
[02:03:23.880 --> 02:03:27.800]  want to have to have wars they want prosperity that's why they understand what's happening they
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:32.280]  were under oligarchs they're not perfect now we won't be after this but we're we're trying to get
[02:03:32.280 --> 02:03:37.560]  self-determination russia realizes that that's why putin has come out and said a vote for trump
[02:03:37.560 --> 02:03:42.600]  was a vote against the elite because it is the whole elite is against trump if we're against
[02:03:42.600 --> 02:03:48.520]  the elite that's been screwing us for 50 years why wouldn't we be for trump this is a real referendum
[02:03:48.520 --> 02:03:54.360]  on whether america wants to be free or not and my question for you is is it is it is it so if
[02:03:54.360 --> 02:03:59.080]  trump wins um i mean you've said it before the battle has just begun but i mean what do you think
[02:03:59.080 --> 02:04:02.360]  soros these elites are going to do the same thing with briggs that they're going to try to shut down
[02:04:02.360 --> 02:04:07.000]  the economy the media the traders are going to keep attacking we have to bombard their sponsors
[02:04:07.000 --> 02:04:12.760]  with boycotts totally turn them off and just ruin them because they want to ruin us so we'd be ready
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:17.320]  for austerity russia's been under austerity for six seven years but putin has a high approval rate
[02:04:17.320 --> 02:04:21.000]  because the russians understand they're being this has been done if we want freedom we have to get
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.240]  ready for austerity call their bluff let and it's going to hurt the bankers work so it's going to
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:30.360]  hurt us okay you want austerity but when they try to burn down our local city not that the cops are
[02:04:30.360 --> 02:04:36.120]  perfect we're going to have to back them because it's it's a globalist foreign attack this is war
[02:04:36.120 --> 02:04:42.680]  brother so get ready and and yeah i know i know you're ready so believe me everybody else is ready
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:50.760]  too so i mean look they've been warned the gloves are coming off right now okay and again they they
[02:04:50.760 --> 02:04:55.000]  made a big mistake they crowed about how they're going to piss on everybody and how they're going
[02:04:55.000 --> 02:05:03.640]  to arrest us all well good luck with that former attorney general eric holder who's now an attorney
[02:05:03.640 --> 02:05:08.360]  that works for the protection of wall street clients at covington burling has written a nasty
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:14.360]  op-ed scolding fbi director james comey for his handling of the investigation into clinton's emails
[02:05:14.360 --> 02:05:20.120]  and the use of a private server he writes an op-ed in the washington post and says quote i fear he
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:25.720]  is unintentionally and negatively affected public trust in both the justice department and the fbi
[02:05:25.720 --> 02:05:31.160]  as he is allowed again without improper motive misinformation to be spread by partisans with
[02:05:31.160 --> 02:05:36.840]  less than pure intentions he goes on to accuse comey of violating long-standing policies and
[02:05:36.840 --> 02:05:41.720]  traditions when the fbi director wrote to members of congress on friday and informed them that the
[02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:47.800]  fbi was in fact reviewing a fresh batch of emails related to clinton i guess that long-standing policy
[02:05:47.800 --> 02:05:52.760]  is never to question hillary clinton will some of us feel that confidence was restored in the doj
[02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:57.720]  and the fbi mr. holder as they appear to finally be doing their job i'm margaret hell reporting

[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:04.920]  now i've got a bunch of putin clips we're gonna play one of them we're gonna do live because
[02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:10.280]  daria speaks fluent russian uh and we've got several others she's already voiced over for us
[02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:15.400]  we're putin saying a vote for trump is a vote for nationalism against foreign globalists
[02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:19.800]  against elites well that's a fact every elite you name is against trump because america is
[02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:24.520]  trying to reestablish itself i mean what no matter what you think about trump he's wrong
[02:09:24.520 --> 02:09:29.320]  on a few issues compared to hillary it's he's an angel and then we have another clip here
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:34.600]  putin says controlled media creates false perception manipulate public opinion
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:39.240]  and we have gowdy smacks down desperate msnbc attempted to distract from clinton with russia
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:44.920]  question the fbi has studied this warrants they say no connections under massive pressure though
[02:09:44.920 --> 02:09:49.880]  they went after the former head of the trump campaign manifold today they sued roger stone
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:54.200]  who joins us in the next hour and ronald trump's saying they're trying to block voting in four
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:09:59.560]  states they're doing exit polls totally legal and lawful we had a democrat polls election official
[02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:06.200]  come out 200 feet we were even a cone set out and said you're that donald trump guy you know well
[02:10:06.200 --> 02:10:10.120]  get out of here i'm calling the police it's on video it's on info wars dot com oh and shroyer
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:15.320]  yesterday this is what we're dealing with in america because we know the fraud beth Harris
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:20.600]  is a democrat she said hillary stealing it they're shaving it with this new fractal system this new
[02:10:20.600 --> 02:10:26.520]  fraction shaving we have them and we're not going to just sit here when they try to steal it
[02:10:28.520 --> 02:10:33.000]  meanwhile communist china basically runs hillary along with saudi arabia the intelligence
[02:10:33.000 --> 02:10:38.120]  community has their emails they're the ones that leaked it that's all coming out and you look at the
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:43.960]  crazy hollywood and the media and all these liberals trying to play spy with this with their goddess
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:50.920]  this tottering dottering mentally ill person it's it's perfect archetypally how weak she is
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:56.360]  trying to cause some civil war in this country problem is a billion dollars later they can't
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:11:02.040]  get black folks to go out and kill the cops like they want so they're in panic mode right now
[02:11:02.040 --> 02:11:08.760]  and it was our guest mr hagman doug hagman of hagman report dot com who five years ago said
[02:11:08.760 --> 02:11:12.200]  the word is from the justice department they're going to start a race for us come on really
[02:11:12.200 --> 02:11:16.840]  now i'm respecting but it just it came true he'll be joining us talk about all of this and his
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:20.760]  connections in the fbi in just a few minutes we have a lot of other connections his are
[02:11:20.760 --> 02:11:24.920]  and more in the fbi than our connections into the military and places like that we'll just leave
[02:11:24.920 --> 02:11:32.120]  it that now continuing looking at all of this they forced americans to finally admit how much
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:36.760]  trouble we're in they forced the decision they thought we were coward just the opposite people
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:40.760]  know they don't have any hope now but to stand up in the information war they want to go physical
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:46.040]  that's their enchilada that's their problem but here it is putin warren's european countries have
[02:11:46.040 --> 02:11:50.520]  no future if they continue to accept migrants where they rape little boys little girls and are
[02:11:50.520 --> 02:11:55.960]  allowed to because it's quote their muslim culture so i'll play this clip first that that that daria
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:03.240]  is going to voice live on air into english and then i have the other other clips uh so daria
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:08.600]  you've got the floor you can set this up if you want then play it uh go ahead uh no we can just
[02:12:08.600 --> 02:12:15.640]  go ahead and play it self-explanatory here it is a migrant just raped a child in one of the european
[02:12:15.640 --> 02:12:21.640]  countries the court found him not guilty based on two things the migrant didn't speak the language
[02:12:21.640 --> 02:12:27.320]  of his host country and he did not understand that the boy and it was a boy didn't want this
[02:12:29.880 --> 02:12:35.240]  it doesn't fit into my head what on earth is going on there this is the result of a delusion
[02:12:35.240 --> 02:12:42.200]  of national values i can't even explain the rationale behind it what's the sense is that a
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:46.760]  guilt before the migrants what's going on it's not clear but a society that cannot defend its
[02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:56.280]  children today has no tomorrow it has no future so relying on their immigration policy experience
[02:12:56.280 --> 02:13:01.960]  is not the best thing we have a thousand year history for a multicultural society understanding
[02:13:01.960 --> 02:13:10.280]  of this for us is much deeper great job daria doing that live on air with us we got several others
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:15.160]  you did giving us even better translation than the google translation that was there now the next
[02:13:15.160 --> 02:13:23.480]  clip uh is putin trump represents americans who are tired of the elites russia 24 then will play
[02:13:23.480 --> 02:13:27.960]  putin controlled media creates false perception but here's putin trump represents americans who
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:35.720]  are tired of the elites when it comes to mr trump himself it seems he has chosen his own way of
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:43.560]  getting through to the hearts and minds of voters and what's the method sure he behaves a little
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:51.000]  extravagantly we all see that but i don't think that all of this is that meaningless in my view
[02:13:51.000 --> 02:13:58.360]  he represents the views of those americans of which there are a substantial number who are tired of
[02:13:58.360 --> 02:14:04.520]  the elites who have been in the halls of power for many decades he simply represents the interests
[02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:12.520]  of you know ordinary people and himself attempts to appear like this ordinary guy that criticizes
[02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:21.160]  those who have been at the helm of power for decades we read america's analytical materials
[02:14:21.880 --> 02:14:28.280]  he represents those people that don't like power being passed on through for example family networks
[02:14:28.280 --> 02:14:34.920]  many u.s experts write about this openly and this is the playing field that he works on but how
[02:14:34.920 --> 02:14:42.120]  effective it will be for him well the elections will show but i want to reiterate again as i always
[02:14:42.120 --> 02:14:47.960]  say we will work with any president that the american people choose and the one that will have
[02:14:47.960 --> 02:14:54.200]  a desire to work with us there you go and they've not been involved in these hacks we now know
[02:14:54.200 --> 02:14:58.360]  is us intelligence they were involved in the un hacks on carbon taxes that affects russia
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:04.360]  that's international and russia said we did that so they're like stay out of our business
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:10.360]  we'll stay out of yours now let's continue here let's go ahead and go to the next clip he says
[02:15:10.360 --> 02:15:16.840]  controlled media creates false perception here it is western mainstream media creates the perception
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:22.200]  that russia has a definite favorite when it comes to the u.s presidential candidates donald trump
[02:15:22.200 --> 02:15:27.160]  how much of a role does the person who becomes america's next president really play for russia
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:34.360]  and what kind of policy should this person advocate in order for our relations to normalize
[02:15:36.040 --> 02:15:44.440]  thank you so when it comes to the so-called favorites or non-favorites as it pertains to
[02:15:44.440 --> 02:15:49.880]  the u.s presidential elections you said that the one who creates this perception is the mainstream
[02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:57.400]  media correct well and that is exactly who created that perception and i can assure you it wasn't
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:10.920]  accidental mainstream media rarely does anything by accident this whole idea that has been implanted
[02:16:10.920 --> 02:16:21.240]  into people's heads as part of the u.s presidential race in my view has only one purpose it is done
[02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:27.000]  by those who are defending the interest of the democratic party represented by mrs clinton
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:37.240]  against the interests of the republican party in this case mr trump and how is it being done
[02:16:37.240 --> 02:16:43.400]  first off you create an enemy in this case it is russia and then they announced that trump
[02:16:43.400 --> 02:16:51.240]  is our favorite it is complete and utter nonsense this simply rubbish this is simply an internal
[02:16:51.240 --> 02:16:57.480]  political method for the purposes of manipulating public opinion as part of the u.s presidential
[02:16:57.480 --> 02:17:03.400]  race that's right and as i've said many times before and i want to repeat myself we don't know
[02:17:03.400 --> 02:17:09.800]  how either of the candidates will behave once they have won we don't know what trump will be like
[02:17:09.800 --> 02:17:17.720]  and we don't know what clinton will be like if she wins what they will deliver on and what they won't
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:27.720]  so for the most part for us it is irrelevant who wins but naturally we can't not welcome
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:34.680]  rhetoric that is being voiced publicly about the normalization of affairs between the u.s and russia
[02:17:35.880 --> 02:17:42.760]  and with this understanding in mind we do of course welcome such sentiment no matter who says it
[02:17:42.760 --> 02:17:49.400]  that's it really but i don't want a bad mouth russia but russia was put under globalist control
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:57.160]  in 1917 it was totally erect and i'm not defending the czars they were like angels compared to the
[02:17:57.160 --> 02:18:01.880]  communists the bolsheviks bunch of foreigners coming and taking over oppressing christians
[02:18:01.880 --> 02:18:07.240]  russia has the gdp of italy now italy's a prosperous nation on average and produces a lot but still
[02:18:07.240 --> 02:18:11.080]  i mean you know italy's the size of texas folks russia's three times the size of us
[02:18:12.680 --> 02:18:17.480]  180 million people are whatever is in russia i mean they can't produce what idly does because
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:21.720]  they've been so downtrodden and they're trying to rebuild the globalists are bullying them because
[02:18:21.720 --> 02:18:25.480]  they're seen as weak that's why even the pentagon doesn't want to mess with russia because it just
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:31.080]  doesn't make sense it's china running rampage everywhere russia's being targeted because it's
[02:18:31.080 --> 02:18:37.400]  seen as weak putin has kicked the oligarchs the very same bankers that run us out and is trying
[02:18:37.400 --> 02:18:43.320]  to resuscitate the country is funding pro-family operations christianity low taxes they have lower
[02:18:43.320 --> 02:18:50.120]  taxes than us and that really pissed us off the globalists because russia was theirs just like
[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:56.280]  america was theirs and i'm tired of it doesn't mean our politicians are perfect our government's
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:19:00.680]  perfect or our local government's perfect but it's our government we want to run our own country we
[02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:07.240]  want fair trade deals we don't want to be sold out and so russia completely gets that narrative
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:12.760]  because they've experienced it and that's where the kinship is happening but it's happening all
[02:19:12.760 --> 02:19:17.240]  the world like the uk of the kinship they've been under globalist control most are laws made by
[02:19:17.240 --> 02:19:23.160]  multinationals as long as we open the debate about tpp and globalism it's over because it's
[02:19:23.160 --> 02:19:28.680]  self-determination we're going to come back with hagman report dot com host dug had been great guy

[02:19:33.160 --> 02:19:37.800]  this going five days out from the election but i wanted to play those clips because i didn't get
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:42.520]  to gaudy and the republicans saying this russian thing i mean give me a break folks they say i'm
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:49.560]  a russian agent that is the most ridiculous horseman there russia isn't affecting my freedom
[02:19:50.440 --> 02:19:55.240]  the the democratic party the council and farm relations the chinese the sawties are
[02:19:55.240 --> 02:20:02.440]  and so i'm lined up to fight them that's how this works you know in the coming election no matter
[02:20:02.440 --> 02:20:07.640]  who gets in one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about on the debates or anywhere is the

[02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:18.120]  hagman report dot com this is the end it's really been on target over the years with what's
[02:24:18.120 --> 02:24:22.520]  happening so let me now go to him he's been sitting there for 15 minutes while i was babbling
[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:28.600]  just give us his intel on what's happening does he concur with the info we have that there is a
[02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:34.040]  counter clue against the globalist takeover the latest information doug hagman thank you for
[02:24:34.040 --> 02:24:40.360]  joining us sir take over thanks for thanks for having me yeah basically everything that you've
[02:24:40.360 --> 02:24:47.880]  come up with my source independent of yours has said right now the the mood at inside just as well
[02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:54.040]  inside the fbi not justice inside the fbi office right now that the Hoover building is is extremely
[02:24:54.040 --> 02:25:00.120]  tense you've got a the upper echelon of the fbi that's fighting against the rank and file members
[02:25:00.120 --> 02:25:05.320]  they're the rank and file are just absolutely upset over what's going on they had gone through
[02:25:05.320 --> 02:25:11.560]  with the new york or nypd task force according to my source on the sexting aspect of the the
[02:25:11.560 --> 02:25:17.640]  sexting investigation of of anthony wiener they had gone through the hard assets including
[02:25:19.320 --> 02:25:25.640]  how can i put this and this is important to understand they actually took not just a laptop
[02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:35.000]  but they also took files off of a desktop inside the wieners residence as well as physically took
[02:25:35.000 --> 02:25:41.560]  the router at the wiener residence and the reason i'm saying this is because there's much more to
[02:25:41.560 --> 02:25:48.120]  this than the media knows or is being told to the media or is being leaked out as we've seen
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:53.560]  they want to keep some things close to the vest but yes the information you're getting right now
[02:25:53.560 --> 02:25:59.400]  is being confirmed by my sources just to kind of summarize this there is okay we're five days out
[02:25:59.400 --> 02:26:04.360]  i mean as much as you can say exactly what what are they fighting they say it's big well yeah
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:09.160]  there's like three different parts to this three different moving parts to this you've got the
[02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:15.800]  classified top secret special access programs those files that were on anthony wiener's computer
[02:26:15.800 --> 02:26:22.360]  without fail that's been verified by my source and they said that's the least of the issues
[02:26:22.360 --> 02:26:28.360]  another aspect of this is the treason espionage part of this and i know how bad that sounds
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:35.160]  i'll expect but there's some indication that and this is why they took the router is that other
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:41.080]  downloads of the documents and i'm talking about the top secret special access program
[02:26:41.080 --> 02:26:48.440]  documents that were in the 656 000 emails on wiener's computer were offloaded to
[02:26:48.440 --> 02:26:56.280]  yet a third party well who's that third party it could very well be um whom is the relations if
[02:26:56.280 --> 02:27:03.000]  you will or could it could be her associates so you've got that aspect and then the third
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:08.200]  and perhaps the most disgusting aspect of this is the sexual angle that
[02:27:10.280 --> 02:27:14.760]  and i don't want to be graphic or gross here well this hasn't broke yet but i was told and we
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:19.480]  haven't talked before the show i was told it ties into lowlita express is that where you're about to
[02:27:19.480 --> 02:27:28.120]  go yes yes it involves uh hillary clinton huma obedin and uh bill clinton as well with jeffrey
[02:27:28.120 --> 02:27:37.240]  epstein epstein oh my god now this has well according to my my sources these files exist
[02:27:38.280 --> 02:27:43.880]  they did not touch my source did not touch or they has no idea what's in those files but the
[02:27:43.880 --> 02:27:50.520]  fact that they exist on this computer suggests some sort of overlap here uh and as much as i
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:56.760]  hate to even think about this uh because in here it based on my source hillary did in fact take part
[02:27:56.760 --> 02:28:02.760]  in some of the junkets too on the lowlita express independent of and with bill clinton blackmail
[02:28:02.760 --> 02:28:07.160]  it's also about huma well that's what i was told by machining they say it's a major foreign
[02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:10.840]  penetration of everything that's why despite the fact our government's corrupt she's got to be
[02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:17.400]  taken down this is total blackmail exactly and and right now they're fighting for their lives
[02:28:17.400 --> 02:28:21.800]  not just for relevance but but for their freedom at this point but but then i think the important
[02:28:21.800 --> 02:28:28.120]  thing that uh that we found that uh if i can say nothing nothing else is the fact that you've got a
[02:28:28.120 --> 02:28:36.120]  great group of individuals within nypd within the uh new york and dc offices of the fbi and within
[02:28:36.120 --> 02:28:41.080]  some of the intelligence agencies working together and i think we haven't talked in months have we
[02:28:41.800 --> 02:28:46.040]  i was told a week ago and i thought when they were listening i thought was weird i was told nypd
[02:28:46.040 --> 02:28:49.720]  was at the tip of the spear of this thing and you're now saying it on air while we talk i was
[02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:56.200]  told by hollible sources that nypd was like an mvp in this yeah absolutely many many of the higher
[02:28:56.200 --> 02:29:03.160]  ranking nypd uh investigators have been pushing for this and they've been getting some resistance
[02:29:03.160 --> 02:29:09.000]  at the with the fbi of course you know traditionally the relationship between the local and federal
[02:29:09.000 --> 02:29:14.360]  law enforcement officials not to it's it's never really a great relationship but in this case
[02:29:14.360 --> 02:29:17.640]  there is a group that bandied together and said look we're not going to allow this to just be
[02:29:17.640 --> 02:29:21.640]  pushed under the under the carpet and they're fighting justice that's what i heard it's so
[02:29:21.640 --> 02:29:28.520]  horrible that no one could ignore it no no they can't and this is why too and then people often
[02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:36.360]  people are looking at and speculating as to why um the fbi just uh posted four separate files on
[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:42.040]  vince foster um that's not just to give people information about what happened at fort marcy
[02:29:42.040 --> 02:29:47.320]  parker with vince foster this is to send a message to comey and the people that let's talk about it
[02:29:47.320 --> 02:29:52.360]  this is seismic this is historic wow we'll be back with mr hagman there's on the railing
[02:29:52.360 --> 02:30:00.040]  one alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:30:00.040 --> 02:30:04.520]  we're red on election day perhaps the biggest election in american history is just days away
[02:30:04.520 --> 02:30:08.840]  we know that in past elections there have been thousands of cases of voter fraud and election
[02:30:08.840 --> 02:30:13.480]  fraud from dead people voting to people registering false identifications to government leaders
[02:30:13.480 --> 02:30:17.640]  providing fast track amnesty to give illegal immigrants votes this is happening right in
[02:30:17.640 --> 02:30:22.040]  front of us now we are seeing the establishment send all its hitmen after the republican nominee
[02:30:22.040 --> 02:30:26.280]  donald trump government shills are campaigning for clinton mainstream news attacking donald
[02:30:26.280 --> 02:30:31.160]  trump all day like rabbit hounds rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake optics
[02:30:31.160 --> 02:30:35.160]  that hillary clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting trump fake
[02:30:35.160 --> 02:30:39.880]  celebrities endorsing clinton across all platforms so with all this what are we doing to keep this
[02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:44.040]  election from being stolen what can we do to prevent election fraud i propose that all
[02:30:44.040 --> 02:30:48.520]  donald trump supporters wear red on election day on november 8 when you head to the polls to vote
[02:30:48.520 --> 02:30:53.400]  donald trump be decked out in red this way just as we dominated in rally turnout we can prove and
[02:30:53.400 --> 02:30:58.120]  provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout wear red on election day and make
[02:30:58.120 --> 02:31:03.400]  america great again hey everyone pharmacist ben fuchs here host of the bright side and as many of

[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:25.320]  just now breaking but he's giving us even more intel stuff that i got from my sources he's now
[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:30.920]  saying on air we didn't talk before the show it's about lolita express pedophilia we know about weiner
[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:36.440]  all the weirdness he's involved in texting 15 year olds that's nothing people and it's a message to
[02:34:36.440 --> 02:34:44.200]  hillary stop it back off quit she's not quitting it'll hurt the country the government everything
[02:34:44.200 --> 02:34:49.240]  of this has to come out i was told weeks ago if they make her they're going to bring it out
[02:34:50.120 --> 02:34:54.440]  so the gloves are off and hillary still steaming straightforward so as much as you can tell us
[02:34:54.440 --> 02:35:01.240]  dr hagman get into what your law enforcement new nypd fbi told you some of this has already come
[02:35:01.240 --> 02:35:06.360]  out in the press where this is going because it's a very dangerous game that's being played and then
[02:35:06.360 --> 02:35:11.960]  patrinik he was a major heavyheader wasn't just the head of psychological warfare of the state
[02:35:11.960 --> 02:35:16.680]  department i'll just stop right there i mean it ran covert operations the army and the cia
[02:35:18.200 --> 02:35:22.680]  super heavy hitter i mean he says they're going after him now he's mentioning individuals are
[02:35:22.680 --> 02:35:28.120]  being targeted now so the war is starting and all the little trendies don't seem to know what
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:32.280]  they're involved in here uh slit in america's throat is a little bit harder than they thought it
[02:35:32.280 --> 02:35:37.240]  would be trumps way ahead in the polls but but but just getting back to weiner why this is being
[02:35:37.240 --> 02:35:42.600]  brought up what's happening with coming is it a double deal what's happening you know it's interesting
[02:35:42.600 --> 02:35:49.080]  because my source uh even before i realized what was going on with dr patinik had mentioned
[02:35:49.080 --> 02:35:53.000]  that uh there was going to be a high-level intelligence source uh a former intelligence
[02:35:53.000 --> 02:35:59.080]  source bringing this out i had no idea until i saw the videos with with dr patinik or saw your
[02:35:59.080 --> 02:36:03.560]  video actually by the way he said on air but also probably he had to get major authorization to do
[02:36:03.560 --> 02:36:08.600]  that right right well a couple of things that i think it's very important for people to understand
[02:36:08.600 --> 02:36:14.840]  too uh even before getting into the lolita express is the fact that you know the fbi agents in that
[02:36:14.840 --> 02:36:23.160]  were tasked with uh destroying the laptops the devices of sharyl mills uh heather samuelson
[02:36:23.160 --> 02:36:29.640]  and others back in july subsequent to the july 5th news conference by comey they did not
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:36.520]  contrary to the belief in reports did not destroy the that hardware or that saw or the data on the
[02:36:36.520 --> 02:36:42.920]  hardware it is it remains in this is the information i have now that hardware that was supposed
[02:36:42.920 --> 02:36:48.680]  to be destroyed that was ordered destroyed is right now in the hands of a group of fbi agents
[02:36:48.680 --> 02:36:55.160]  and is being held at the fbi and and it's it's ready to be disclosed well that's confirmed now
[02:36:55.160 --> 02:36:59.960]  that the majority of the fbi is now for the first time in their nine-year history in rebellion
[02:36:59.960 --> 02:37:03.720]  because they see the clear and present danger i mean what percentage would you say this is that
[02:37:03.720 --> 02:37:10.280]  accurate and you know who's who in this well well it's real simple the high brass of the fbi
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:15.480]  you're talking about the uh uh sake the special agents in charge you know at the different uh
[02:37:16.520 --> 02:37:23.160]  different uh the levels is yeah or anyone inside the bell way at a level higher than the department
[02:37:23.160 --> 02:37:28.840]  had they have pretty much sold out or at least that's the feeling in the rank and file comey's
[02:37:28.840 --> 02:37:35.080]  sitting with a stack of resignations on his desk he's just he he's beside himself there are people
[02:37:35.080 --> 02:37:39.400]  who have no you said that three months ago i know you're on coast to coast since then it came out
[02:37:39.400 --> 02:37:43.720]  there's a stack of resignations just proving your point yeah yeah and there are people who've known
[02:37:43.720 --> 02:37:51.240]  comey for years who refuse to talk to him today because of his july 5th um uh uh is his uh press
[02:37:51.240 --> 02:37:56.520]  why for portaly's thinking about leaving i'm sure i mean believe me i would not want to be
[02:37:57.080 --> 02:38:02.760]  i wouldn't want to be in that household but having said all of that um you know to i'm looking at
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:09.240]  comey too and i you know uh having the experience in is an operational and informational asset with
[02:38:09.240 --> 02:38:14.040]  the department of justice and the fbi myself i mean i understand the things go very slowly and
[02:38:14.040 --> 02:38:18.680]  there's a whole big bureaucracy there um but but i'll tell you this there are a bunch of great
[02:38:18.680 --> 02:38:23.560]  people in the rank and file the fbi the agents the field agents the people that are worth people
[02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:28.040]  exactly so these are the people who are getting together and saying and working with the in my
[02:38:28.040 --> 02:38:35.000]  pd and by the way ruddy juliani um is people better be looking at him really close and listening
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:41.080]  to what he's saying because he's behind well um he's responsible i would say for a lot of this
[02:38:41.080 --> 02:38:47.480]  information coming from the nypd segment of this group of patriots that we see forming and pushing
[02:38:47.480 --> 02:38:55.080]  back against the uh the sold out political hacks within the intelligence agencies so yeah i was
[02:38:55.080 --> 02:38:59.960]  talking to a top secret service agent former secret he said a few months ago he said watch
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:05.240]  what the nyp that nypd does i didn't know what he was talking about yeah and and that's that's a
[02:39:05.240 --> 02:39:11.800]  thing too um there of course there's political politicalization within the nypd as well however
[02:39:11.800 --> 02:39:15.800]  they're less likely because they're not a centralized they're less likely to be overtaken
[02:39:15.800 --> 02:39:22.360]  the task force that was uh um that was sent out against uh weiner uh who by the way just
[02:39:22.360 --> 02:39:27.000]  checked himself in i i didn't hear earlier your program i was traveling uh weiner just
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:33.720]  checked himself into a rehab sexual rehab clinic i saw that yeah uh that's on the advice of his
[02:39:33.720 --> 02:39:39.560]  council and that is to cover to get him out of the way exactly um but although you know they
[02:39:39.560 --> 02:39:46.600]  well people can get to him there just as easy if not easier than elsewhere but um my sources are
[02:39:46.600 --> 02:39:52.360]  saying that's being done for his own safety right now for his own safety and also as a legal maneuver
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:58.040]  you've got huma versus but i agree with some of my other sources said uma and weiner boy
[02:39:58.040 --> 02:40:04.440]  they better be watching on because hillary might put the touch on him well you saw that we
[02:40:04.440 --> 02:40:10.600]  would happen i mean in the in the drop of a dime you had hillary clinton suddenly just push huma
[02:40:10.600 --> 02:40:16.600]  away refer to huma as one of just one of her staffers and i mean that relationship changed
[02:40:16.600 --> 02:40:22.920]  on a dime she's gone from being her girlfriend to boom well exactly but the backstory there is
[02:40:22.920 --> 02:40:28.200]  weiner has a lot of the information and i do believe and this is basically on the sources
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:33.800]  my source uh in one in particular that i have that weiner is in fact uh that they're afraid of what
[02:40:33.800 --> 02:40:39.080]  he's gotten they're afraid of him being this loose cannon is it true that his file was called insurance
[02:40:39.880 --> 02:40:44.920]  you know i asked that question and i can't get a definitive answer on that i've seen that
[02:40:44.920 --> 02:40:50.360]  rumored about it about and i saw another one that said that you know triple x or sex or whatever
[02:40:50.360 --> 02:40:56.520]  uh the file or folder names i uh no one's saying anything which kind of leads me to believe that
[02:40:56.520 --> 02:41:02.120]  that's not a hundred percent true uh however the information behind it is and i think that's kind
[02:41:02.120 --> 02:41:08.680]  of a way to vet who's saying what to who um and it's a good i've seen it done in the past it's a
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:13.160]  good way to clear things up so we're going to identify where the leaks are so absolutely well
[02:41:14.760 --> 02:41:17.800]  other intel you've got 10 other points you want to make to the listeners
[02:41:18.440 --> 02:41:24.840]  and the viewers out there five days next five days next six days the most dangerous period
[02:41:24.840 --> 02:41:31.240]  in american history in recent memory that's number one number two we are being set up for a uh
[02:41:31.240 --> 02:41:38.600]  uh constitutional crisis regardless of who wins if hillary wins the uh investigations and potential
[02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:45.720]  indictment follow her if trump wins the other side the hillary side including podesta and everyone
[02:41:45.720 --> 02:41:52.120]  around her are going to question the legitimacy of the elections so we are facing a constitutional
[02:41:52.120 --> 02:41:57.640]  crisis regardless of who wins watch from the date of election until the date of inauguration
[02:41:57.640 --> 02:42:05.880]  another dangerous period and also potentially um giving a reason uh for obama to and this i
[02:42:05.880 --> 02:42:10.760]  never thought this is possible but delay the elections which yes this could happen in the
[02:42:10.760 --> 02:42:17.080]  case of a false flag war or if hillary would win and an indictment passed down he could uh
[02:42:17.080 --> 02:42:21.640]  he could say wait a minute we're going to delay the elections uh and that has a lot to do it is
[02:42:21.640 --> 02:42:28.280]  crazy it sounds uh it has a lot to do with um with the um you know with the intent i'll just
[02:42:28.280 --> 02:42:32.760]  leave it at this with the intent of the globalist uh we've talked about this before that they're
[02:42:32.760 --> 02:42:38.440]  still pushing for social societal chaos well it's because you were the first guy ringing the alarm
[02:42:38.440 --> 02:42:43.000]  bells more than five years ago about a project with soros race war now i believe you because
[02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:46.680]  you're a credible guy but now it's all happened it kind of fell on its face those everybody woke
[02:42:46.680 --> 02:42:50.760]  up to it but they have now like tripled the amount of money usually was like a hundred million a
[02:42:50.760 --> 02:42:54.600]  year they were spending now it's like 300 million a month and then they are quadrupling one of the
[02:42:54.600 --> 02:42:58.920]  number is they are just going crazy with hundreds of millions every few months being given ford
[02:42:58.920 --> 02:43:04.680]  foundation soros to saying cops are the problem kill the cops burn everything down i mean clue
[02:43:04.680 --> 02:43:11.000]  that's part of their larger plan yeah exactly and that's going to be their plan until it succeeds or
[02:43:11.000 --> 02:43:16.360]  until it's completely exposed i mean the uh objectives don't change the plans do the time
[02:43:16.360 --> 02:43:21.320]  change the timing does change so you know i stand by what i said five years ago four years ago
[02:43:21.320 --> 02:43:26.120]  and three years ago that the plans change the objectives don't and this is we're facing such
[02:43:26.120 --> 02:43:30.120]  a critical time in history right now sure they got a handful of cards they they change which ones
[02:43:30.120 --> 02:43:33.880]  are going to play but the same cards how is it going for team new world order it seems like
[02:43:33.880 --> 02:43:40.760]  they're getting their ass kicked well that's a great way to put it i think they are but i think
[02:43:40.760 --> 02:43:45.480]  that in the end they hold all the cards you know it's kind of like playing against the house the
[02:43:45.480 --> 02:43:50.520]  house always wins you know we we're playing against the dealer within the house you know
[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:57.560]  or playing the poker game you know there there's the the house take the house always wins in the
[02:43:57.560 --> 02:44:03.640]  end you've got war that's possible war with well look at what's going on with syria and look in
[02:44:03.640 --> 02:44:09.320]  the south china sea as well i do believe that there's an issue and very interesting too alex
[02:44:09.320 --> 02:44:17.240]  um the uh the blame game against russia is not just because of the emails but this is also to
[02:44:17.240 --> 02:44:23.640]  demonize russia in the with the american people because of syria which all comes down to not
[02:44:23.640 --> 02:44:31.000]  just the gun running and such but the pipeline between iran and guitar and this is where um
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:37.160]  huma abedin her saudi connections will come into play as well so this is like a three-dimensional
[02:44:37.160 --> 02:44:43.240]  chess game and people really have to understand not just any one uh any one small part of this
[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:47.240]  but the entirety of the picture the whole bunch of different agendas and a bunch of
[02:44:47.240 --> 02:44:52.280]  special interests and hillary who just loves money and steals furniture and everything where
[02:44:52.280 --> 02:44:56.520]  you she's just a crazy crook who'll do whatever she's told she's kind of the front person
[02:44:56.520 --> 02:45:00.200]  with this whole mental illness i want to take some phone calls from martin and andrew and
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:04.760]  matthew and john and steven others doug hagman of hagman report dot com's joining us i'm out of
[02:45:04.760 --> 02:45:09.560]  shows with info wars dot com but i've been asking the questions here you've had amazing information
[02:45:09.560 --> 02:45:15.240]  what else is on your radar screen what else do you want to tell people well i would say i would
[02:45:15.240 --> 02:45:21.000]  you know pray and prepare i guess first and foremost but uh again i would watch the the next
[02:45:21.000 --> 02:45:25.640]  couple of days or next several days until the election and then until the inauguration different
[02:45:25.640 --> 02:45:31.640]  uh potentialities there and even if hillary wins and watch that but uh specifically false
[02:45:31.640 --> 02:45:36.760]  flags with respect to domestic violence we saw some really horrible things executions with
[02:45:36.760 --> 02:45:42.120]  against police officers overnight watch for more of that watch for anything that would give the
[02:45:42.120 --> 02:45:47.240]  uh established uh oh you know what alex i forgot to mention this i wrote myself a note here i want
[02:45:47.240 --> 02:45:54.840]  to just go back to uh information i had earlier the files that were on um uh reportedly on um
[02:45:54.840 --> 02:46:02.840]  what uh winners uh laptop include names of some republicans within the gang of eight so it's oh
[02:46:02.840 --> 02:46:07.880]  this is a larger blackmail op bring this into an investigation because what i was told is hillary
[02:46:07.880 --> 02:46:12.760]  actually activated this to cover comies but but do a larger threat and i guess is that what you're
[02:46:12.760 --> 02:46:17.560]  saying well yeah i mean we've got republicans and democrats or progressives and conservatives
[02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:23.320]  alike involved in the sexual component to this as well as the clinton foundation which is front
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:29.320]  and center for the money money laundering of the sex so you've got i mean again this is so complex
[02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:34.280]  um however that's what machinic says it's a major intelligence operation to corrupt people
[02:46:34.280 --> 02:46:41.560]  oh yeah yeah but what the nyp god bless those those men and women with the nypd the task force
[02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:49.560]  headed by the nypd going after weiner's uh laptop and and the uh devices there what they saw they
[02:46:49.560 --> 02:46:57.560]  realized what they had and by the way they gave comey they gave uh uh the fbi uh two weeks to
[02:46:58.440 --> 02:47:02.280]  go through this and it was actually three that's what i was told that they don't it's a press
[02:47:02.280 --> 02:47:07.720]  conference exactly so is comey good or bad or in between or what's happening with him man i'll
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:13.320]  tell you what i i don't know you've got it depends on who i talked to at the bureau i look i don't
[02:47:13.320 --> 02:47:17.560]  know i mean some people say well he's a good guy give him a break he's he's under pressure but
[02:47:17.560 --> 02:47:24.680]  to me i think he um you really um now he's sold out i believe sure wouldn't he have not gone
[02:47:24.680 --> 02:47:33.080]  after hillary though if it wasn't green lighted by obama uh yes i mean i mean he look if if
[02:47:33.080 --> 02:47:38.520]  they wanted to take down hillary they could have with the information that they got back in april
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.440]  um or or you know through april to june they could have taken her down they could have taken
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:51.240]  obadin down they could have taken others down look um uh the sexual the sexting of of weiner just
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:59.080]  for as an example according to my nypd source this guy's been doing this since 2010 they knew about
[02:47:59.080 --> 02:48:05.720]  the hillary camp knew about weiner since 2010 not 11 but 2010 sure so i know you can't go too far
[02:48:05.720 --> 02:48:09.560]  but but but just help because she knows we'll be on here tomorrow we're five days out the world's
[02:48:09.560 --> 02:48:14.840]  crazy what did my pd tell you what what's on there because what i was told was and i've seen it
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:21.160]  hinted by intelligence people that it's it's lonely to express its kids well yes it's kids
[02:48:21.160 --> 02:48:28.120]  involves the soddies involve boy yeah involves the soddies involves uh people from the middle east
[02:48:28.120 --> 02:48:32.920]  very big money uh interest from the middle east but we know clinton's flying out with his top
[02:48:32.920 --> 02:48:39.480]  cheek there's a pedophile yeah yeah and involves hillary kuma and uh to a lesser extent weiner was
[02:48:39.480 --> 02:48:45.400]  just kind of a a prop if you will and that's probably a good uh you know an app description
[02:48:45.400 --> 02:48:51.160]  for him but uh uh yeah this this is are you saying weiner is that's is it kind of a pimp
[02:48:52.760 --> 02:48:59.480]  weiner is um my source told me that weiner does not have a whole lot of smarts all right um
[02:48:59.480 --> 02:49:04.280]  he might have some street smarts but he's got this uh insatiable sex drive he's kind of like bill
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:11.800]  that's who she shows he's a cutout that's her front right right yeah and yeah he gives her cover
[02:49:11.800 --> 02:49:17.560]  i mean i mean huma is uh is a muslim of course living with her mother and sister living with her
[02:49:17.560 --> 02:49:21.560]  right now in her in their new york apartment according to the information i have and and
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:27.800]  that's another thing too the um the sharing of information between huma from weiner's computer
[02:49:27.800 --> 02:49:34.200]  through huma to the mother uh soley abedin who runs the journal muslim minority affairs
[02:49:34.840 --> 02:49:39.320]  muslim sisterhood and such as well as the sister so there's the espionage component there there's
[02:49:39.320 --> 02:49:46.520]  the sexual component with weiner uh via getting children for bill epstein uh and even huma and
[02:49:46.520 --> 02:49:51.080]  hillary wow okay all the interview with you for like 14 years i've never heard anything this hard

[02:54:09.640 --> 02:54:16.040]  going to pop him trump is a nationalist he's not perfect none of us are but he isn't out to get people
[02:54:17.080 --> 02:54:21.480]  i just go back to that and that's why they're so scared of him i wanted to ask you just briefly
[02:54:21.480 --> 02:54:25.240]  i want to go to calls but doug hagman i want your your view you're a smart guy i respect your
[02:54:25.240 --> 02:54:28.520]  views i don't just say that i mean i that's why i have on people that have been proven you know
[02:54:28.520 --> 02:54:33.400]  they've got their info dialed in who is donald trump i mean why are they so scared of him
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:39.640]  i think they're scared of him because they can't they don't own him they don't have anything on
[02:54:39.640 --> 02:54:45.560]  him which is why you saw that release of that audio tape from uh uh what ten years ago they don't
[02:54:45.560 --> 02:54:50.600]  have anything i mean he's not been a part of the washington dc mechanism so they really don't
[02:54:50.600 --> 02:54:55.640]  yeah although he's been friends with uh even hillary clinton he's donated to her campaign
[02:54:55.640 --> 02:55:01.160]  i mean he's matter of events he's been nice right but but he's not been on the inside he's not been
[02:55:01.160 --> 02:55:07.400]  co-opted yet no his corruption is steaks and ice cream the guy didn't even smoke or drink i mean
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:12.120]  the people i talked to he's like so conservative it's crazy right and so that's why they're afraid
[02:55:12.120 --> 02:55:18.040]  i mean he's like a he's like someone you can't control he's like a wild card so and in fact
[02:55:18.040 --> 02:55:23.160]  it was my understanding from uh initial reports they did not think that he was even going to be
[02:55:23.160 --> 02:55:27.400]  close to being nominated oh they thought the way elix he'd be a great loser they must have submitted
[02:55:27.960 --> 02:55:33.800]  right so so they're uh they're afraid as to because right now we're seeing and as you pointed out
[02:55:33.800 --> 02:55:39.160]  and you're the great patriot as well uh with with your show and all of these revelations
[02:55:39.720 --> 02:55:43.400]  they are afraid of the people waking up saying wait a minute not no more this is enough we've
[02:55:43.400 --> 02:55:47.880]  retired of the culture of corruption retired of the clinton culture of corruption and bang where
[02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:52.200]  out of here and this is why they're afraid of trump because they're afraid trump will in fact
[02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:57.240]  uh clean house and because he's got nothing to lose he flips a few switches our economy explodes
[02:55:57.800 --> 02:56:02.200]  let's go ahead he'll call their bluff too great points let's talk to andrew wisconsin
[02:56:02.200 --> 02:56:08.520]  and john and michigan andrew thanks for holding your own the year hi alex i just wanted to know
[02:56:08.520 --> 02:56:12.520]  a couple things uh with the staggering amount of evidence that's been unveiled on your show in the
[02:56:12.520 --> 02:56:19.320]  last 27 hours now what is being done about uh the fraudulent voting machines and why isn't
[02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:24.120]  hillary under arrest it's very minute sir i mean they admit they're putting in these point shavers
[02:56:24.120 --> 02:56:28.120]  they've been caught they admit all the crimes wiki leaks is out there a thousand reasons
[02:56:28.120 --> 02:56:34.680]  you should be arrested i i i agree it's it's it's an epic moment um mr hagman no um and call me
[02:56:34.680 --> 02:56:40.520]  doc no optics i think for one i i think there are some people even on the good that the people
[02:56:40.520 --> 02:56:46.520]  are trying to expose everything understand that an arrest at this point could ignite and i mean
[02:56:46.520 --> 02:56:51.160]  ignite the country and none of the good people none of the people that are on our side so to
[02:56:51.160 --> 02:56:57.320]  speak want to see the country go up in flames so they want to do this in such a manner that justice
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:57:03.000]  is served but it's done um but if they want to push it we can't capitulate we're not we're not
[02:57:03.000 --> 02:57:07.400]  going to start in this but i mean right they're they're they're crazy i think they're gonna win
[02:57:07.400 --> 02:57:11.560]  this i mean i think the i i think the takeaway is from everybody i've talked to who are serious
[02:57:11.560 --> 02:57:19.000]  people no we're not giving up and we've just begun to fight absolutely yeah i mean look hillary
[02:57:19.000 --> 02:57:23.880]  is behind the first time ever real curve politics has six polls up she's behind in all of them all
[02:57:23.880 --> 02:57:28.840]  these polls over sample democrats and she's losing six eight ten points we put it on screen what do
[02:57:28.840 --> 02:57:34.840]  you think's going on andrew i believe it's being totally rigged and it's been being rigged from
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:40.440]  the start and as she found out bev did yesterday it's been going on for multiple years dating back
[02:57:40.440 --> 02:57:45.960]  many decades it's a globalist agenda and i'm sick of looking at it i want to do something about it
[02:57:45.960 --> 02:57:51.160]  i'll be damned if she's going to come and win the election fraudulently and take my gun then that's
[02:57:51.160 --> 02:57:56.440]  the thing even though it's not good for business they want to dominate why do the globalists want
[02:57:56.440 --> 02:58:02.280]  to extinguish america why are they so obsessed with it doug well it's it's not just america it's all
[02:58:02.280 --> 02:58:08.520]  national it's all countries i mean uh it goes back to the tower of babel i mean it's biblical
[02:58:08.520 --> 02:58:15.720]  in its its nature's its origins uh if you know that they just want everybody under one rule and
[02:58:15.720 --> 02:58:18.600]  that's of course their control freaks like you and i don't want to run our neighbors
[02:58:18.600 --> 02:58:23.720]  but plus the whole counter city they want to run it all which wiki league shows they're up till

[02:58:55.480 --> 02:59:01.240]  about on the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability of the power grid the potential for power grid
[02:59:01.240 --> 02:59:09.320]  chaos emp cyber warfare not to mention dangerous weather hurricanes ice storms all a very real
[02:59:09.320 --> 02:59:14.120]  threat to our grid my friend's chaos is already here and it's going to get a lot worse that's why
[02:59:14.120 --> 02:59:19.720]  i believe that all my listeners need to have a way to produce their own supply of backup electricity
[02:59:19.720 --> 02:59:25.480]  now i've got the perfect power solar generator system in my house the solutions from science system
[02:59:25.480 --> 02:59:31.160]  simply put this thing is amazing solutions from science only makes the best equipment go to
[02:59:31.160 --> 02:59:38.040]  power grid chaos dot com that's power grid chaos dot com to check it out now this is key right now
[02:59:38.040 --> 02:59:45.000]  gets 70 off their top of the line perfect power solar generator this is the one i use in my home
[02:59:45.000 --> 02:59:55.160]  go to power grid chaos dot com and get 70 off you're listening to the alex jones show
[03:00:03.160 --> 03:00:10.120]  we built our resistance just in time to the storm it's provenance my friends we're all part of
[03:00:10.120 --> 03:00:16.760]  it so does the alex general all right that's our guest for five more minutes on the jam where your
[03:00:16.760 --> 03:00:23.080]  calls in then uh roger stunts right it's a big break it is it's so clear cut because i'm always
[03:00:23.080 --> 03:00:27.160]  honest about who's bad and who's good i mean it's all i can do all i've got is telling the truth
[03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:31.800]  it's it's it's a kind of an ocd deal i mean even when stuff makes me look bad i tell the
[03:00:31.800 --> 03:00:36.440]  truth about it okay i did this i did that because once you give it the lies you lose who you are
[03:00:36.440 --> 03:00:41.400]  are hillary and who were she represents are pure evil trump is the real deal it's why they're so
[03:00:41.400 --> 03:00:46.840]  scared and and this is like newtonian physics for every action there's an opposite equal reaction
[03:00:46.840 --> 03:00:52.680]  trump and the populist movement and you are that reaction uh pigment report dot com doug hagman's
[03:00:52.680 --> 03:00:55.880]  our guest let's take a few more calls here john and michigan you're on the air go ahead
[03:00:57.240 --> 03:01:01.960]  mr jones i know you get a lot of new listeners every day and i would like to just alert them
[03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:07.880]  them in case they've got buyers or morris from putting in an absentee ballot that at least
[03:01:07.880 --> 03:01:13.880]  eight states allow voters to change or cancel their early absentee ballots including battlegrounds
[03:01:13.880 --> 03:01:21.880]  like michigan pennsylvania and wisconsin um a list of all states that i can find are minnesota
[03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:30.280]  wisconsin michigan pennsylvania new york connecticut louisiana and hawaii okay so what are you
[03:01:30.280 --> 03:01:33.880]  saying people should do if they were a democrat invited for hillary they should cancel and go
[03:01:33.880 --> 03:01:41.480]  over trump they it varies how it works per state in my state if i go to the poll and vote they
[03:01:41.480 --> 03:01:46.600]  will throw out my absentee ballot but every state probably has different rules i'd like your all
[03:01:46.600 --> 03:01:51.160]  say this the biggest problem is the vote shaving that's why we contested we expose that we do exit
[03:01:51.160 --> 03:01:54.840]  polls that's why they're trying to sue trump i appreciate your calls on great points so that
[03:01:54.840 --> 03:02:00.200]  we can't do that that that looks pretty guilty doesn't it doug oh yeah absolutely and a matter of fact
[03:02:00.200 --> 03:02:06.200]  i was talking with uh with somebody this past weekend uh 80 percent of the mail-in ballots
[03:02:06.200 --> 03:02:14.280]  in maricopa county apparently are already in um um which is significantly more and more than
[03:02:14.280 --> 03:02:20.040]  the no we've had a record early voting right but but the numbers are not adding up when i guess
[03:02:20.040 --> 03:02:23.960]  what i'm trying to say is in maricopa county the numbers aren't adding up there's too many ballots
[03:02:23.960 --> 03:02:30.040]  that are coming in more than what that went out oh yeah in philadelphia they're reporting 140 120
[03:02:30.040 --> 03:02:36.360]  percent in precincts of the registered voters have voted massive fraud exactly and according to my
[03:02:36.360 --> 03:02:42.440]  source by the way we are uh we're being told that they that the people inside that the well the good
[03:02:42.440 --> 03:02:48.040]  guys are indeed expecting although the trump to win the popular vote hillary to to win the electoral
[03:02:48.040 --> 03:02:55.080]  vote in some twisted fashion and uh and certainly win but but that's that that's what i've been told
[03:02:55.080 --> 03:03:00.680]  to prepare for but the good news is all the stuff with the lily the express everything's coming out
[03:03:00.680 --> 03:03:05.160]  so they're going to steal the election good luck we're going to absolutely politically blow you
[03:03:05.160 --> 03:03:10.680]  away yeah exactly i mean i mean don't i don't put words in your mouth from your sources is that what
[03:03:10.680 --> 03:03:16.680]  they're saying yeah yeah which is why the full court press is on now and thanks for for uh you
[03:03:16.680 --> 03:03:22.120]  know helping out with that yeah it's uh it's there's this expectation of theft of the election
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:26.360]  whether through the electoral vote or whether through some other means like ballot stuffing
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:31.560]  or whatever or changing the you know the the uh lecture the black box voting uh however this can
[03:03:31.560 --> 03:03:37.240]  be changed in by just exposing about what you're doing what we're doing exposing everything laying
[03:03:37.240 --> 03:03:42.920]  it all out not going along with it not buying it it'll blow up on their face yeah exactly exactly
[03:03:42.920 --> 03:03:47.080]  all right great points um i'll take other calls after you're gone i want to thank you for the time

[03:03:56.200 --> 03:04:01.480]  or blowing smoke but uh i've got to say i think i think that you know thank you for what you do
[03:04:01.480 --> 03:04:07.480]  i think everyone can see right now everything you've been talking about the last 20 plus years
[03:04:07.480 --> 03:04:12.600]  it's all coming to a head right now you're on the right right side of history and as a matter of fact
[03:04:12.600 --> 03:04:18.200]  you own in my view this section of history and from the bottom of my heart i want to thank you for
[03:04:18.200 --> 03:04:22.600]  what you do thank you for being a good patriot that you are thank you for exposing this for being

[03:04:32.760 --> 03:04:37.720]  Doug i mean this is history and if we don't make the right decision here i i think there's gonna be
[03:04:37.720 --> 03:04:42.840]  a world war that's what everybody can feel is the danger is why our spirits are on edge is because
[03:04:42.840 --> 03:04:48.120]  pass this line if we don't do the right thing here we're gonna we're gonna lose everything amen brother

[03:04:52.280 --> 03:04:57.160]  these are the times the trimon souls the energy level is unprecedented
[03:05:00.440 --> 03:05:06.120]  we have an article up on our website written by paul joseph watson details a former british ambassador
[03:05:06.120 --> 03:05:11.720]  saying hey john pedesta the email leak was done by a washington insider not russians well that's
[03:05:11.720 --> 03:05:16.440]  pretty obvious you should look to washington and not to moscow i'm talking about british ambassador
[03:05:16.440 --> 03:05:21.400]  craig murray who says the source of the john pedesta email leak was a washington insider and not the
[03:05:21.400 --> 03:05:26.680]  russians as the clinton camp would like us all to believe he says quote the source of these emails
[03:05:26.680 --> 03:05:31.000]  and leaks has nothing to do with russia at all i discovered what the source was when i attended
[03:05:31.000 --> 03:05:36.120]  the sam madams whistleblower award in washington he then goes on to blast the narrative that
[03:05:36.120 --> 03:05:41.400]  wiki leaks is a conduit for russia by asserting that the claims are designed to divert attention
[03:05:41.400 --> 03:05:47.000]  from their content and material well said craig murray and it goes hand in hand with the narrative
[03:05:47.000 --> 03:05:51.800]  that the democrats are so desperate that i didn't even realize how absurd it sounds to blame the kgb
[03:05:51.800 --> 03:06:00.920]  for hijacking our democracy i'm margaret hell reporting for info wars dot com there was a mighty

[03:08:00.440 --> 03:08:06.280]  mr trump i'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know but i am going to ask
[03:08:06.280 --> 03:08:13.640]  you to seriously think about making the issue of hillary's election fraud in the primaries
[03:08:13.640 --> 03:08:19.480]  one of the central issues to defeating her in november and i'm telling you november 8th we
[03:08:19.480 --> 03:08:23.880]  better be careful because that election is going to be rigged first of all is rigged and i'm afraid
[03:08:23.880 --> 03:08:28.200]  the election is going to be rigged i have to be honest and i hope the republicans are watching
[03:08:28.200 --> 03:08:33.160]  closely or it's going to be taken away from us america teaches everybody how to live in quote
[03:08:33.160 --> 03:08:39.080]  democracy but what you actually believe that they have democratic elections there if hillary
[03:08:39.080 --> 03:08:44.280]  steals the nomination and then she openly is engaged in chicanery and things don't add up with
[03:08:44.280 --> 03:08:52.680]  trump you have to say it must be thrown out hillary clinton has had every advantage every break
[03:08:52.680 --> 03:08:57.640]  given to her from the very beginning by this democratic party it is going to rig the political
[03:08:57.640 --> 03:09:03.080]  parties choose their nominee not the general public uh fancier just my bitter belief and why
[03:09:03.080 --> 03:09:08.360]  about holding the primaries that's a very good question it is clearly the case that when given
[03:09:08.360 --> 03:09:14.680]  truth serum debbie washington schultz exactly for first hillary clinton to be the nominee obviously
[03:09:14.680 --> 03:09:18.360]  and to the extent there are things that can be done institutionally and marginally to
[03:09:18.920 --> 03:09:22.600]  facilitate that outcome they are being done when did the press see it as their
[03:09:22.600 --> 03:09:27.480]  role to protect the prerogative of the powerful actually i think that's part of it and we're
[03:09:27.480 --> 03:09:32.600]  not going to recognize queen hillary if there's evidence of fraud and guess what there is she
[03:09:32.600 --> 03:09:38.680]  stole the nomination of course the elections will not be rigged what does that mean how would
[03:09:38.680 --> 03:09:43.880]  the party pick a new nominee today is the day they're really thinking about maybe getting him
[03:09:43.880 --> 03:09:49.320]  off the top of the ticket he now looks increasingly like the kamikaze candidate uh an implosion
[03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:53.960]  the likes of which i have never seen the biggest problem we have is we have a very dishonest
[03:09:53.960 --> 03:10:03.080]  media if mr trump is suggesting that there is a conspiracy theory that is uh being propagated
[03:10:04.680 --> 03:10:13.320]  across the country including in places like texas um that's ridiculous that doesn't make
[03:10:13.320 --> 03:10:19.240]  any sense and i don't think anybody would take that seriously texas the world stands up against
[03:10:19.240 --> 03:10:25.080]  the globalist roger stone he's been sued by the democratic party he's been sued by their activist
[03:10:25.080 --> 03:10:31.480]  group so is donald trump for having exit polls that is a part and parcel of the state department's
[03:10:31.480 --> 03:10:36.680]  own global program to ensure elections are accurate if it's five percent off they call the election
[03:10:36.680 --> 03:10:43.240]  a fraud hillary clinton was the secretary of state we sent oh and shroyer out to one of the biggest
[03:10:43.240 --> 03:10:48.120]  polling places he's 200 feet away they have you that cones out and the guy comes out and says you're
[03:10:48.120 --> 03:10:53.400]  with donald trump there's no such thing as fraud i'm calling the police get out of here that's coming
[03:10:53.400 --> 03:10:59.640]  up at the bottom of the hour and let me go to the election officials they say get out of here
[03:10:59.640 --> 03:11:07.000]  here i mean this is unprecedented and the polls now even when they're sampling 9 12 15 20 points
[03:11:07.000 --> 03:11:13.400]  for hillary trump is now six points ahead nationally that's rogerport.com roger stone joining us to
[03:11:13.400 --> 03:11:18.120]  talk about this and other things that are happening i've been talking roger to my intelligence sources
[03:11:18.120 --> 03:11:24.120]  and others and they say that it's lolita express stuff with weiner and a router shunting stuff
[03:11:24.120 --> 03:11:30.600]  the saudi arabians they say it's so open and shut that uh hillary should step down right now my
[03:11:30.600 --> 03:11:34.360]  problem is that might put the whole election into jeopardy this is a crazy time what do you want to
[03:11:34.360 --> 03:11:41.400]  cover first some former head of the trump campaign roger stone well it is clear alex that the clinton
[03:11:41.400 --> 03:11:51.800]  campaign responds to all of the recent revelations including the existence of 650 000 emails that
[03:11:51.800 --> 03:12:00.680]  uhlma have been seems to have forwarded to herself to create a database uh is to fall back on their
[03:12:00.680 --> 03:12:07.880]  canard that donald trump uh and his associates including yours truly are in been dead with the
[03:12:07.880 --> 03:12:16.360]  russians an nbc piece yesterday asserting again that paul mannifort my ex-partner former chairman
[03:12:16.360 --> 03:12:23.880]  of the trump campaign is under investigation for his ties to the russians as he told nbc completely
[03:12:23.880 --> 03:12:29.000]  falls they're not some ledger as you said six months ago was something scribbled in it i mean
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:33.080]  this is their privilege something on a bathroom stall believe the new york times had to admit
[03:12:33.080 --> 03:12:39.160]  fbi investigation no trump connections yeah i so i mean i i just don't think the american people
[03:12:39.160 --> 03:12:45.080]  are buying this if this was their october surprise if that if this is what they were hoping to
[03:12:45.080 --> 03:12:51.400]  would not trump out of the box in the final week um it i don't know what's buying it now everyone's
[03:12:51.400 --> 03:12:59.960]  laughing at it i think that is the case i mean my sources tell me that that the ramifications
[03:12:59.960 --> 03:13:08.600]  of umas emails are multiple not only is there i'm told the strong possibility and we're on top of
[03:13:08.600 --> 03:13:17.160]  this that they were selling access to some of the documents that were in this database that was created
[03:13:17.800 --> 03:13:24.920]  to foreign powers good god but but additionally i am told that there may be blackmail material
[03:13:24.920 --> 03:13:33.240]  there that was sent to hillary by uh by jeffrey eppstein as a sample of what would happen if
[03:13:33.240 --> 03:13:42.280]  he were fully prosecuted um there are however reports out there that that uh bill and hillary
[03:13:42.280 --> 03:13:48.040]  and huma and infity weiner were on eppstein's plane based on my research that is false
[03:13:48.760 --> 03:13:54.520]  that's based on the f a i mean bill was but not bill was on the bill was bill was but none of the
[03:13:54.520 --> 03:13:59.880]  others what is interesting is of course that whenever bill was there his right hand man dug
[03:13:59.880 --> 03:14:06.600]  band uh was within perhaps this is why band is not expendable sure he also dumped uh he also
[03:14:06.600 --> 03:14:11.000]  dumped a secret service detail so this is a big deal what do you make of steve pacanik
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:15.880]  obviously a major heavy hitter not just with the state department but in black ops you name it
[03:14:15.880 --> 03:14:20.840]  overthrowing countries he says he's never showed his face in 25 years they're making their move right
[03:14:20.840 --> 03:14:28.120]  now in a counter coup yeah i think i think that i think that there are elements uh inside the
[03:14:28.120 --> 03:14:33.400]  government who aren't going to stand for the clinton's shenanigans and it appears to me like
[03:14:33.400 --> 03:14:40.520]  obama is backing off the clinton's i mean it really appears to me like um they have figured out
[03:14:40.520 --> 03:14:48.040]  that she's going down it is amazing the extent to which this is not yet dawned on some in the in
[03:14:48.040 --> 03:14:54.040]  the mainstream i was wondering what do you make of their still childlike arrogance and false bravada
[03:14:54.040 --> 03:15:01.480]  listen she would not be campaigning in detroit if she were confident she would not be dumping
[03:15:01.480 --> 03:15:07.720]  more money into colorado if she were confident uh confident they admit things have tightened even
[03:15:07.720 --> 03:15:12.920]  nate silver with the new york times who i try to take a little bit of a grain of salt points out
[03:15:12.920 --> 03:15:19.800]  that for every point that trump gains nationally he's gaining in the swing state trump has a little
[03:15:19.800 --> 03:15:26.280]  flagger in his depth he is increasingly confident as he feels the momentum i can tell you having
[03:15:26.280 --> 03:15:31.880]  been through nine presidential campaigns it's not the numbers that are as important right now as the
[03:15:31.880 --> 03:15:37.960]  direction and the momentum is with trump in the final week this is where you'd prefer to be the
[03:15:37.960 --> 03:15:43.000]  worst place to be in american politics is trying to hold a lead trying to write out a lead because
[03:15:43.000 --> 03:15:47.720]  when you're sitting still you're losing votes well that's what carter's top holster's saying you know
[03:15:47.720 --> 03:15:52.360]  he collapsed last week he was on fox he's you know two days ago saying hillary is now collapsing
[03:15:52.360 --> 03:15:56.920]  you can see that you can see your own people exiting her major papers not endorsing her
[03:15:57.480 --> 03:16:00.680]  they better do the right thing and back off because i've been told by people that are
[03:16:00.680 --> 03:16:05.640]  heavy hitters that i mean this is not a game folks that this is not talking to some journalist or
[03:16:06.360 --> 03:16:10.040]  some other normal person they say they've got stuff they don't want to bring out because it's
[03:16:10.040 --> 03:16:13.960]  so damaging to the whole country but they're going to do the hydro nuclear you know thermal
[03:16:13.960 --> 03:16:20.040]  nuclear hydrogen bomb option if they try to sneak hillary in there's going to be press conferences
[03:16:20.040 --> 03:16:26.200]  stuff coming out that is just just total devastation so if hillary wants to keep pushing it i'm told
[03:16:26.200 --> 03:16:33.480]  they're loaded double lock book well but the other point that that is clear is that as they begin to
[03:16:33.480 --> 03:16:40.520]  look into the abyss stare into the abyss at defeat the chances of them trying to steal this to save
[03:16:40.520 --> 03:16:46.040]  themselves increase exponentially sure their only hope cornered rats is to steal it so looking
[03:16:46.040 --> 03:16:51.720]  into your crystal ball roger one of the top crystal balls out there what do you see we have to have
[03:16:51.720 --> 03:16:57.960]  a very effective election day operation to monitor for voter fraud which brings into the lawsuit let's
[03:16:57.960 --> 03:17:02.760]  talk about that yeah i know look i have been sued in federal court i don't trump and i have been sued
[03:17:02.760 --> 03:17:09.640]  along with the trump campaign in the republican national committee claiming that we are going
[03:17:09.640 --> 03:17:15.720]  to use exit polls somehow to intimidate voters which isn't even logical because in an exit poll
[03:17:15.720 --> 03:17:21.480]  you don't even address the voters until after they have we did it and had the democrats flipping out
[03:17:21.480 --> 03:17:26.600]  yesterday yeah because they don't want to be watched they absolutely don't want to be watched
[03:17:26.600 --> 03:17:31.880]  because this is where the shenanigans have to take place and they take place traditionally in
[03:17:31.880 --> 03:17:38.280]  those places where you have one party rule this idea that this is racially based is just not true
[03:17:38.280 --> 03:17:41.880]  no they're doing it in austin that's the only democratic county they are doing it wall to wall
[03:17:42.920 --> 03:17:52.440]  and political today peace by ben schreckinger lumps me with neo-nazis and and uh and white
[03:17:52.440 --> 03:17:57.560]  supremacists i really resent that i mean well let me just add this as you bring it up i said there
[03:17:57.560 --> 03:18:02.360]  isn't a jewish mafia running things they shouldn't say that trump's saying that we talked about tpp
[03:18:02.360 --> 03:18:07.400]  but that the immanuels are mafia they turned into headlines jews run the world i mean they
[03:18:07.400 --> 03:18:12.920]  did they're so deceptive yeah this is i actually had to complain to complain to an editor at
[03:18:12.920 --> 03:18:19.480]  political because this cost a line uh look i'm a trump partisan i'm a conservative i'm a libertarian
[03:18:19.480 --> 03:18:27.960]  oriented conservative uh but it's a lump me with repugnant you know folks like david duke is really
[03:18:27.960 --> 03:18:32.680]  beyond the pale just beyond the pale ontario that makes me man the same deal for whatever reason
[03:18:32.680 --> 03:18:36.040]  those are the people that attack me more than anybody and make stuff up about me
[03:18:36.040 --> 03:18:41.160]  and send people to my house i mean i'm not saying duke did it but other ones the damn white supremacists
[03:18:41.160 --> 03:18:48.200]  are the most crazy piranha like nuts and i don't get why it really i agree it's it's like how dare
[03:18:48.200 --> 03:18:54.440]  you lump me in with those people so anyway you slice it here you have you have built by a
[03:18:54.440 --> 03:19:00.920]  station association going both ways if you're not for thermonuclear war with russia you must be a russian
[03:19:00.920 --> 03:19:07.960]  agent and this is the new mccartyism if you are fort detente if you are for you know hard-headed
[03:19:07.960 --> 03:19:13.640]  negotiations in some coexistence with the russians then you must be working and here against hillary
[03:19:13.640 --> 03:19:20.200]  you're a kkk grandragon yeah so you know it it's like what is it guys i mean it's kind of like
[03:19:20.200 --> 03:19:25.960]  obama saying there is no voter fraud it doesn't exist but we're going to have a un come in and
[03:19:25.960 --> 03:19:31.560]  monitor for voter fraud the russians are hacking elections but the elections can't be hacked which
[03:19:31.560 --> 03:19:36.920]  is it they can't even get their storyline straight we're four and a half days out my friend i guess
[03:19:36.920 --> 03:19:41.960]  five days we count to the election day i mean clearly trump i know you want to be always pessimistic
[03:19:41.960 --> 03:19:46.120]  to be safe but even with these over samples he's six points ahead i mean they've got to be panicking
[03:19:46.120 --> 03:19:52.360]  right now i think that there is a real panic uh and if you look at their schedules if you look at
[03:19:52.360 --> 03:19:59.320]  the the clinton schedules of where they're going in the final days um but that is that is really
[03:19:59.320 --> 03:20:03.160]  telling let's talk about that because it dovetails with where they're suing you and trump
[03:20:03.160 --> 03:20:08.360]  these key battlegrounds let's talk about that appears to me like bill is going to colorado
[03:20:08.360 --> 03:20:14.680]  because um we shipped out an entire an enormous box of whistles today uh from a group of activists
[03:20:14.680 --> 03:20:20.280]  who want to greet the former president with their official bill clinton rape whistles oh yeah
[03:20:20.280 --> 03:20:23.640]  did you see hillary flip out yesterday with somebody the bill clinton's a rapist she would
[03:20:23.640 --> 03:20:30.200]  totally crush you yes we got to find that guy and give him an award uh yeah no look they they
[03:20:30.200 --> 03:20:37.240]  can dish it but they can't take it that the media matters for america bullies you know call me every
[03:20:37.240 --> 03:20:42.120]  name in the book but when you turn the tables on them they they wind like a bunch of children
[03:20:42.120 --> 03:20:47.320]  they crap their parents yep yep agreed is this not the most epic election ever
[03:20:47.320 --> 03:20:52.280]  yeah because i think we are about to grab our country back from the globalists
[03:20:53.000 --> 03:20:58.600]  this is a sea change every other election i've been involved in at the presidential level has
[03:20:58.600 --> 03:21:05.400]  been republicans versus democrats this election is the elite of the republican party and the
[03:21:05.400 --> 03:21:12.200]  democratic party versus uh don trump and the outsiders i mean there's a piece by the well
[03:21:12.200 --> 03:21:21.640]  known don if john weaver about why uh john k6 refusal to support the national tip because the ticket
[03:21:21.640 --> 03:21:29.320]  is somehow heroic john look up rockefeller nelson your man is doomed he's finished he is on the
[03:21:29.320 --> 03:21:33.800]  wrong side of history well let's talk about that love let's talk about that what happens if they do
[03:21:33.800 --> 03:21:39.000]  steal it uh what happens if we're you know next wednesday and hillary's won by three points and
[03:21:39.000 --> 03:21:43.560]  we've got election fraud evidence everywhere what do we do well i mean that's going to be up to one
[03:21:43.560 --> 03:21:48.120]  person donald j trump but if the evidence we know he's going to fight we know he's going to fight
[03:21:48.120 --> 03:21:52.840]  he's a fighter in it but that's why the exit poll we're doing through stuff this deal is so important
[03:21:52.840 --> 03:21:58.280]  you can't just claim this was stolen without solid admissible and they want to block you and
[03:21:58.280 --> 03:22:03.400]  claim a selection disruption yeah well we're going to publish the results of our exit poll if it shows
[03:22:03.400 --> 03:22:09.720]  no fraud that's what we will show everything will be sworn under oath this is a democratic exercise
[03:22:09.720 --> 03:22:16.200]  but we are using the exact same methodology that the networks are used also in post article saying
[03:22:16.200 --> 03:22:22.600]  we're not roger stone is it smart enough to do an exit poll the arrogance look i've been using
[03:22:22.600 --> 03:22:28.680]  sophisticated survey research for 30 years in a political career i actually know more about it than
[03:22:28.680 --> 03:22:32.840]  no i know there's this perpetual arrogance though where they act like we can't even wipe our own you
[03:22:32.840 --> 03:22:38.360]  know what's i mean well i didn't go to yale i didn't go to harvard and you know my father was a well
[03:22:38.360 --> 03:22:45.640]  digger so i couldn't possibly know anything i mean yeah it's it's elitism is what it is i mean i saw
[03:22:45.640 --> 03:22:53.560]  this piece yesterday by dana millbank of the washington post calling the idea that danie williams
[03:22:54.360 --> 03:23:00.200]  is bill clinton's son which i believe he is based on the research i did for my book clinton's war on
[03:23:00.200 --> 03:23:06.200]  women which you can get it in fours dot com uh you know calling it a conspiracy theory this
[03:23:06.200 --> 03:23:13.240]  little elitist turd uh is perhaps the single most repugnant member of the press corps i mean he's
[03:23:13.240 --> 03:23:19.320]  wrong about everything but he has an arrogance about him that is really annoying i know the
[03:23:19.320 --> 03:23:25.240]  bigger the loser the more they worship them and hold them up it's like a club of ugly ducklings
[03:23:25.240 --> 03:23:30.520]  or something uh roger stone other points we need to impart the folks now just four and a half five
[03:23:30.520 --> 03:23:38.360]  days out just uh we need the support to stop the steal we need more people we need uh obviously we
[03:23:38.360 --> 03:23:43.960]  need more money our training video is about to be released we do have a concern of course now
[03:23:44.600 --> 03:23:50.360]  about infiltrators all we need is one person who volunteers to work at the polls and goes through
[03:23:50.360 --> 03:23:55.880]  the training and then goes out there and acts like a jackass uh and they're we know we can be
[03:23:55.880 --> 03:24:00.360]  blamed so we're trying as best as we can to but folks have to know that's going to happen we've
[03:24:00.360 --> 03:24:04.040]  already had people dressed up in our hillar for prison shirts and scream stuff they should then
[03:24:04.040 --> 03:24:09.400]  we tracked it back so listeners are sophisticated they understand that roger well remember that we
[03:24:09.400 --> 03:24:15.000]  had we know now and i predicted it right here months and months ago not predicted but i called it
[03:24:15.000 --> 03:24:21.880]  that you said they were sending people dress as sanders to attack trump but even i sanders and
[03:24:21.880 --> 03:24:28.280]  trump yeah exactly and it turned out thanks to the wiki leaks that this all checks out and to the
[03:24:28.280 --> 03:24:32.840]  terrific work done by james o keith at veritas have you seen this latest where you got this
[03:24:32.840 --> 03:24:40.680]  democrat hiding black people yes it's extraordinary it is everything we suspected and worse what's
[03:24:40.680 --> 03:24:46.040]  amazing is the mainstream media black let me ask you this because i grew up as a republican but i
[03:24:46.040 --> 03:24:50.600]  mean i every and only racism i ever heard was around democrats and i thought it was some tests
[03:24:50.600 --> 03:24:55.480]  to see if i was racist and they went no we really hate mexicans and black people i don't understand
[03:24:55.480 --> 03:24:59.720]  like if you experience this where the racism is always by them but they're the ones that claim
[03:24:59.720 --> 03:25:05.000]  they're fighting it we're the ones in the party of linkedin they're the ones in the traditional
[03:25:05.000 --> 03:25:12.920]  party of the clan and anti-catholicism for that matter so uh this is this is you know as i think
[03:25:12.920 --> 03:25:19.480]  you pointed out yesterday everything they have done they turn around and accuse us of everything
[03:25:19.480 --> 03:25:27.240]  whether it is running errands for the clique around uh put in return for huge dollars or or or or
[03:25:27.240 --> 03:25:33.160]  engaging in instigating violence it is it's a mirror image everything that they have done they
[03:25:33.160 --> 03:25:39.960]  turn around and accuse us of the hutzpah is just extraordinary well it's clearly coming to a head
[03:25:39.960 --> 03:25:44.120]  and this is a very dangerous time the nuclear forces in russia in the u.s and china are all
[03:25:44.120 --> 03:25:48.520]  in alert roger thanks for joining us seven days a week we're back tomorrow you're a busy man stone

[03:30:05.080 --> 03:30:10.200]  wall street clients at covington furling has written a nasty op-ed scolding fbi director
[03:30:10.200 --> 03:30:15.480]  james comey for his handling of the investigation into clinton's emails and the use of a private
[03:30:15.480 --> 03:30:21.240]  server he writes an op-ed in the washington post and says quote i fear he is unintentionally and
[03:30:21.240 --> 03:30:26.440]  negatively affected public trust in both the justice department and the fbi as he is allowed
[03:30:26.440 --> 03:30:31.880]  again without improper motive misinformation to be spread by partisans with less than pure
[03:30:31.880 --> 03:30:38.120]  intentions he goes on to accuse comey of violating long-standing policies and traditions when the fbi
[03:30:38.120 --> 03:30:43.480]  director wrote to members of congress on friday and informed them that the fbi was in fact reviewing
[03:30:43.480 --> 03:30:48.680]  a fresh batch of emails related to clinton i guess that long-standing policy is never to question

[03:33:29.640 --> 03:33:34.760]  riding here with you for the last 30 minutes we are going to play that video that alex was
[03:33:34.760 --> 03:33:39.720]  alluding to of owens reyer talking to an election official very angry election official who was uh
[03:33:39.720 --> 03:33:46.200]  uh he was just extremely pissed off of why a young man like owens reyer dressed in a suit would be
[03:33:46.200 --> 03:33:50.760]  questioning our election results and how dare he do that and i'm going to go to a couple of your
[03:33:50.760 --> 03:33:55.240]  calls before we play that video and then also um we've been trying to get in contact with the
[03:33:55.240 --> 03:34:00.280]  texas governor trying to get him on record uh on it just a couple specific things that we're
[03:34:00.280 --> 03:34:05.480]  you know asking for to make sure our elections are transparent and that there can be a recount done
[03:34:05.480 --> 03:34:11.480]  and it can be done correctly using the ballot images uh as to what uh bev harris was talking
[03:34:11.480 --> 03:34:18.200]  about when you make a when you cast a poll you get a ballot image which is a picture of that
[03:34:18.760 --> 03:34:24.120]  particular ballot and it has a serial number on it and that is the problem with a lot of our
[03:34:24.120 --> 03:34:29.320]  elections we have these ballot images either aren't saved or they're not produced by the
[03:34:29.320 --> 03:34:34.200]  machines and our election officials are saying no reason to save them so i'm going to get into that
[03:34:34.200 --> 03:34:38.840]  a second guys don't let's we'll go to that in one second i'm just trying to explain what's going on
[03:34:38.840 --> 03:34:47.480]  here but we have instances like that where you have bona fide ways to go back and do a recount
[03:34:48.040 --> 03:34:52.920]  of an electronic voting machine and they're not allowing that to happen and it's happening
[03:34:52.920 --> 03:34:58.520]  all across the country it's not just um you know in texas or louisiana or arkansas it's
[03:34:58.520 --> 03:35:02.120]  happening all over the country where they use electronic voting machines there's no way to
[03:35:02.120 --> 03:35:06.760]  do a proper recount because they don't save these things and we had david night go and ask
[03:35:06.760 --> 03:35:11.560]  keith ingram who's the head of our elections in texas try to ask him hey why are you telling
[03:35:11.560 --> 03:35:15.160]  the uh precincts that they don't have to keep the ballot images just simple question
[03:35:15.160 --> 03:35:18.920]  he didn't even want to talk to us he did not even want to talk to us and you can find that
[03:35:18.920 --> 03:35:24.280]  interview on the alex jones channel rnfowars.com but let's go to matthew in new york he wants
[03:35:24.280 --> 03:35:28.040]  to talk about the polling system and the election 2016 go ahead matthew
[03:35:28.040 --> 03:35:37.080]  hey rob uh actually i just uh launched a new website here about a week ago it's a completely
[03:35:37.080 --> 03:35:42.040]  open source polling system and for the past week we've been calling homes around the country
[03:35:42.040 --> 03:35:48.840]  over 300 000 homes and publishing the results live to call for america dot com um and i'm really
[03:35:48.840 --> 03:35:55.000]  just calling the the let people know that we have now our own open source polling system
[03:35:55.000 --> 03:35:59.560]  and it's really up to us to decide whether or not the results that we're seeing from everybody
[03:35:59.560 --> 03:36:05.000]  else is accurate there's been a lot of talk about the over sampling has taken place uh we just took
[03:36:05.000 --> 03:36:11.000]  a directory of um over 108 million uh white page listings in united states and are calling every
[03:36:11.000 --> 03:36:17.080]  single state and is this a computer calling them or a person this is a computer calling them
[03:36:17.080 --> 03:36:22.120]  okay these are these are robo calls yeah um so you know but there's a lot more than just the
[03:36:22.120 --> 03:36:26.120]  excitement about being able to have our own polls you know be able to see that we're up
[03:36:26.120 --> 03:36:31.480]  approximately 40 points in florida for example but i've loaded up the website with a couple of
[03:36:31.480 --> 03:36:37.080]  campaigns such as americanism globalism anybody can take any message that we want to get out there
[03:36:37.080 --> 03:36:43.000]  and literally call millions of homes and leave leave messages on the answer machines and um
[03:36:43.560 --> 03:36:47.480]  you know i i think this is really a game-changing tool give us the website again give us your
[03:36:47.480 --> 03:36:52.760]  website again give us your website one more time call for america call for america and is
[03:36:52.760 --> 03:36:58.920]  the number four or is it f o r yeah it's f o r okay i'm telling you this thing is addicting
[03:36:58.920 --> 03:37:03.240]  this thing is addicting for the past week i've just been refreshing my web page because as the
[03:37:03.240 --> 03:37:07.960]  calls are made everything updates in real time and the reason why i'm really calling in today
[03:37:07.960 --> 03:37:14.120]  is because i've been taking messages that you guys create for example you've got the america
[03:37:14.120 --> 03:37:18.520]  criticism not globalism you've got the hillary for world war three and i've been calling homes
[03:37:18.520 --> 03:37:23.000]  and playing that message and leaving it and answering machines but really it's about the
[03:37:23.000 --> 03:37:27.720]  cleverness of the community anybody can create a campaign and immediately publish out on the
[03:37:27.720 --> 03:37:34.040]  website and start blasting calls there's a there's a lot a lot of people who really don't think that
[03:37:34.040 --> 03:37:39.560]  robo calling has any effect nowadays but these guys the reason why they've got these loopholes
[03:37:39.560 --> 03:37:43.720]  and they've allowed it to keep running for so long is because it works these are the people
[03:37:43.720 --> 03:37:48.840]  that are voting and we can get millions and millions and millions this is a new way of spamming
[03:37:48.840 --> 03:37:54.200]  that's entirely legal and i i really really just want people to know about it because i think it
[03:37:54.200 --> 03:37:58.680]  can make a huge huge difference at call4america.com and i really appreciate everything you guys are
[03:37:58.680 --> 03:38:02.440]  doing but this is the only community that we've got in order to get the word about this is the
[03:38:02.440 --> 03:38:07.080]  only community i built this website for and put over 40 on a second matthew go back to florida
[03:38:07.080 --> 03:38:11.320]  guys you said you said 40 points up in florida i just saw you guys were about to bring up florida
[03:38:11.320 --> 03:38:18.280]  bring that one up again so looks like 464 for trump 163 for hillary and played message no answer
[03:38:19.080 --> 03:38:23.400]  picked so when they pick up they don't always complete those surveys that correct they might
[03:38:23.400 --> 03:38:28.040]  pick up and then hang up correct okay they pick up and they hang up i mean if you're going back to
[03:38:28.040 --> 03:38:32.520]  the october 30th we've been sending out these press releases to all of the press including
[03:38:32.520 --> 03:38:38.840]  you guys um since since um since the 25th if you go back to the 30th in florida alone we've
[03:38:38.840 --> 03:38:46.600]  got a 418 people that were um participated 71% voted for trump 21% for hillary if you look at
[03:38:46.600 --> 03:38:54.280]  colorado on the same day 507 people participated out of the 20 000 that we call 55% for trump 38%
[03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:58.680]  for hillary but if you go to pennsylvania you go to virginia you go anywhere anywhere on the east
[03:38:58.680 --> 03:39:03.320]  coast and tell me it's not looking so good but this system with this system we can actually call
[03:39:03.320 --> 03:39:07.880]  every single home and i don't know what to tell the people though i don't know what to tell them i've
[03:39:07.880 --> 03:39:13.400]  had my heading pro rec programming for so long that i don't know what messages they need to hear
[03:39:13.400 --> 03:39:17.800]  and i need the info wars community which is the only community that i've ever supported in my
[03:39:17.800 --> 03:39:21.640]  entire life to figure out what the heck are we going to say these people to make them change
[03:39:21.640 --> 03:39:26.280]  their minds um well throughout your website there again i guess people can just get on
[03:39:26.280 --> 03:39:31.000]  and just grab things from themselves and start participating is that correct correct well they
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:35.000]  can go on there and create their own campaign this thing also connects people to their congressmen
[03:39:35.000 --> 03:39:38.920]  so if they want to call and stop a piece of legislation they can create a campaign that's
[03:39:38.920 --> 03:39:43.880]  going to call a million people and prompt them to press one to speak with their congressmen it
[03:39:43.880 --> 03:39:49.080]  asks them for their zip code and forwards the call to their congressman records it puts it on the
[03:39:49.080 --> 03:39:53.720]  website so it's more than just a polling system it's more than just a message broadcasting system
[03:39:53.720 --> 03:40:01.320]  it's really a soul for trolls for spammers and for us the info wars community for whoever's clever
[03:40:01.320 --> 03:40:05.800]  enough to make the right neuro and west six sentence that's going to get to the american people
[03:40:05.800 --> 03:40:11.880]  i call for america dot com all right matthew thanks for calling in uh and yeah go to call for america
[03:40:11.880 --> 03:40:16.120]  check it out check out the polls that was pretty interesting looks like florida and colorado both

[03:40:33.160 --> 03:40:38.520]  rapes are saying i actually did it uh last week in uh springfield ohio at the trump rally and uh
[03:40:38.520 --> 03:40:43.640]  he actually turned around and gave me a thumbs up stopped in the middle of his speech to do it and uh
[03:40:43.640 --> 03:40:48.120]  i had a lot of people at work that i uh showed the video to and a lot of people i asked you know
[03:40:48.120 --> 03:40:52.280]  why would you do something like that you know why would you do that and i explained it to him

[03:40:58.280 --> 03:41:03.080]  lot of people uh asking more questions like how long have you known about this and i was like

[03:41:17.640 --> 03:41:22.360]  were sharing around work and you know i'm like yeah you know it's uh it was actually on the uh
[03:41:22.360 --> 03:41:27.560]  on the one of the pages on the uh wall street journal uh website too you can see my uh my picture
[03:41:27.560 --> 03:41:31.800]  in the back i tell you that's how we're going to make a difference is waking up one person at a time
[03:41:32.440 --> 03:41:35.960]  you know people see mainstream media and they might be tv heads all their life and not know
[03:41:35.960 --> 03:41:39.800]  about anything else and they may go to their the the websites that their friends tell them about
[03:41:39.800 --> 03:41:44.600]  on facebook and a lot of people aren't really in uh to politics right now they they see some stuff
[03:41:44.600 --> 03:41:50.120]  uh but going out and showing them specifics showing them wow these are the these are it
[03:41:50.120 --> 03:41:55.560]  occurs that four women at a press conference that that have had you know sexual relations with
[03:41:55.560 --> 03:42:01.320]  bill clinton while he was married and our president and and one of them he even uh settled a sexual
[03:42:01.320 --> 03:42:06.920]  assault case with one of them claims he raped him uh one of them you know we had his girlfriend on
[03:42:06.920 --> 03:42:12.280]  who knew him for years and knew he was you know uh loose in his ways and is this the kind of people
[03:42:12.280 --> 03:42:17.240]  we want to put back in the white house one bill clinton and then his wife who covers for him
[03:42:17.240 --> 03:42:22.520]  constantly i mean you know yeah i hear people say you got to stand by your man but at some point
[03:42:22.520 --> 03:42:26.040]  if he's a criminal they don't run for office don't run for public office if you if you want to
[03:42:26.040 --> 03:42:31.800]  stand by your man go back to your hole like she lob and don't come back out thanks for calling
[03:42:31.800 --> 03:42:36.680]  michael and that's that's one way to do it you got to get you know people's faces and talk to him
[03:42:36.680 --> 03:42:41.400]  that's one way to change public opinion now let's go to this video from oan schreuer
[03:42:41.400 --> 03:42:45.720]  how he was uh just asking questions about the elections he was we were just doing our own
[03:42:45.720 --> 03:42:51.080]  informal poll to find out how people were early voting here in austin texas and this is what happened
[03:42:51.080 --> 03:42:56.920]  oh insurer for info wars dot com i am standing outside of an early voting place this is actually
[03:42:56.920 --> 03:43:01.800]  considered the mega early voting place they've got extra machines in there so you don't have to
[03:43:01.800 --> 03:43:07.080]  wait in line and actually this is the fourth early voting place i've been to and this is the
[03:43:07.080 --> 03:43:12.440]  the least amount of people that i've actually seen so i'm not sure if that's because early voting
[03:43:12.440 --> 03:43:16.520]  has been going on so long that everybody's already done it maybe it's halloween people are staying
[03:43:16.520 --> 03:43:21.080]  in or perhaps it's just a dead location but this is supposed to be the biggest one what we're
[03:43:21.080 --> 03:43:24.440]  going to do is we're going to do a little exit polling but mainly what we're going to try to
[03:43:24.440 --> 03:43:29.960]  figure out is if people are worried about election fraud or voter fraud if they're worried about the
[03:43:29.960 --> 03:43:37.320]  integrity of this election we have massive amounts copious amounts of evidence that can prove election
[03:43:37.320 --> 03:43:44.920]  fraud and voter fraud goes on and the most recent evidence is the bev harris fractional magic report
[03:43:44.920 --> 03:43:51.560]  that we've covered that came out today that is really groundbreaking and shows in real time
[03:43:51.560 --> 03:43:56.520]  how the election results can be manipulated so with all this proof with all this evidence
[03:43:56.520 --> 03:44:02.440]  let's go find out do the american people worry about the integrity of the upcoming election
[03:44:02.440 --> 03:44:05.960]  you just finished up your early voting in austin texas who'd you vote for today sir
[03:44:07.480 --> 03:44:13.560]  i'm a democratic straight democrat ticket so hillary clinton yes let me ask you a question sir do
[03:44:13.560 --> 03:44:21.160]  you trust the electronic voting machines uh well i have no what are what an alternative we have
[03:44:21.160 --> 03:44:25.880]  uh to accept that they're probably rigged like everything else in this country uh
[03:44:27.720 --> 03:44:31.400]  you couldn't pull it there i mean do you trust the integrity of these elections
[03:44:32.360 --> 03:44:37.400]  we have to if not then there's no reason for us to be here are you worried though that people
[03:44:37.400 --> 03:44:44.120]  might be trying to meddle with them possibly but i feel like there's a enough checks and balances that
[03:44:44.120 --> 03:44:49.640]  the right thing the right outcome will will happen independently owned um so that there's
[03:44:49.640 --> 03:44:56.760]  not biased by the government but um we need to look into like who it's owned by and if that independent
[03:44:58.760 --> 03:45:04.760]  is is there by bias within that independent organization so what if you saw programs who
[03:45:04.760 --> 03:45:09.160]  go and they run the same process that the electronic voting machines do and then they show
[03:45:09.160 --> 03:45:13.800]  how the results can be switched or fixed using decimals and fractions would you maybe lose trust
[03:45:13.800 --> 03:45:18.280]  then yeah for sure so that's what we've just discovered yeah that seems like it's a thing
[03:45:18.280 --> 03:45:21.480]  that's happening right now so don't you think it's important no matter what side you're on
[03:45:21.480 --> 03:45:25.640]  whether you like hillary or donald that we should all be looking at the electronic voting machines
[03:45:25.640 --> 03:45:29.960]  and if we have doubts in the integrity perhaps maybe going back to paper ballots absolutely i
[03:45:29.960 --> 03:45:33.320]  mean i wouldn't mind taking the time if that's what if that's what we have to do to get our
[03:45:33.320 --> 03:45:36.360]  results correct it's probably worth it don't you think absolutely and i think it should be fair
[03:45:36.360 --> 03:45:41.080]  for everybody no matter who you're voting for i'm the election deputy any yes how you do an
[03:45:41.080 --> 03:45:47.560]  oansroyer from info wars dot com max isher you're probably okay as long as you don't discuss candidates
[03:45:47.560 --> 03:45:52.120]  and particularly by name which that lady did um but if we're just doing exit polling though as
[03:45:52.120 --> 03:45:56.440]  long as i don't say anything electioneering as long as you're out in a way so they can't say the name
[03:45:56.440 --> 03:45:59.800]  either they're really not supposed to because somebody's standing here could think they were
[03:45:59.800 --> 03:46:03.560]  electioneering if i'm saying if we didn't even bring up any of the candidates and we were just
[03:46:03.560 --> 03:46:07.400]  asking us who did you vote for yeah yeah no names and we just said do you trust the electric voting
[03:46:07.400 --> 03:46:13.240]  machines and that was it i think that that would be okay though why would you think they didn't
[03:46:13.240 --> 03:46:16.920]  trust the machines well there's a lot of people that's what we're out here yeah there's all the
[03:46:16.920 --> 03:46:22.520]  reports going on they just ran tests so you're interested in all kinds of rumors and stuff
[03:46:22.520 --> 03:46:27.160]  why don't y'all call out to the election office and get permission and then come here if you want
[03:46:27.160 --> 03:46:43.240]  okay you want to talk to us you really don't want to talk to us at all people are concerned the
[03:46:43.240 --> 03:46:45.800]  election is going to be rigged i guess they're really going to be concerned when they see you
[03:46:45.800 --> 03:46:53.000]  turn your back on us yeah well can i talk to him will anybody here talk to us or do you want to
[03:46:53.000 --> 03:46:59.640]  rig this why are you cutting off all these audit trails why are you cutting down the paper audit
[03:46:59.640 --> 03:47:06.680]  trails well there you go that should tell you something people concerned about elections
[03:47:06.680 --> 03:47:11.240]  being rigged you've got the director of elections here the secretary of state office that won't talk
[03:47:11.240 --> 03:47:16.280]  to us takes one look at the press and turns on walks off we really prefer you not run down our
[03:47:16.280 --> 03:47:21.800]  system people don't really trust anything anymore i'm just asking question it's not my report oh i
[03:47:21.800 --> 03:47:27.320]  know but when you ask it in a certain way you actually influence the person well i hope i would
[03:47:27.320 --> 03:47:32.040]  influence them to do some research but they won't but you do realize that one of the candidates is
[03:47:32.040 --> 03:47:36.760]  the one who's calling into question whether these things work or not which makes it a political
[03:47:36.760 --> 03:47:41.160]  statement there's no no no that's not true have you talked with the people who made these things
[03:47:41.160 --> 03:47:45.720]  have you talked with the people out there who program them i was on ballot control one time
[03:47:46.280 --> 03:47:51.560]  they call us out there and they make sure that those machines are 100 accurate we worked
[03:47:51.560 --> 03:47:54.920]  well would you want to do an interview with us no for a heart or what company i prefer
[03:47:54.920 --> 03:48:00.040]  deep old or smart mattet heart heart's the one that does these uh their name used to be something
[03:48:00.040 --> 03:48:06.680]  different but it's heart now heart graphics and it's the one used in dallas in houston and uh
[03:48:06.680 --> 03:48:12.120]  el paso i think it is i'm just saying it's such a complicated thing to talk about it being fixed
[03:48:12.120 --> 03:48:17.800]  is ridiculous i'd have to disagree to keep playing around yeah you disagree i'd but i'm not doing
[03:48:17.800 --> 03:48:21.960]  anything illegal we're not trying to play around we went to the sun for the capital office i've worked
[03:48:21.960 --> 03:48:27.480]  on it for 20 years okay but to sit here and say it's absurd i mean that's absurd you're sorry you've
[03:48:27.480 --> 03:48:31.800]  got dead people voting and illegal people voting move beyond my marker all right we will call a
[03:48:31.800 --> 03:48:36.360]  constable okay we're not breaking any laws all right ladies and gentlemen so we just did some
[03:48:36.360 --> 03:48:40.280]  exit polling here and we had to deal with an election official actually we had to deal with
[03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:44.840]  him twice the first time he asked us to move um even though we weren't breaking the law originally
[03:48:44.840 --> 03:48:49.160]  he still had a smooth we obliged we wanted to continue doing our interviews then he came and
[03:48:49.160 --> 03:48:54.840]  harassed us again said we weren't outside of the hundred feet even though it was his marker that we
[03:48:54.840 --> 03:48:59.800]  were obeying he said we had to go even further and then when we tried to talk to him he didn't seem
[03:48:59.800 --> 03:49:03.640]  to like us very much he said we were non-existent info wars doesn't exist because he's never heard
[03:49:03.640 --> 03:49:08.120]  of it and apparently election rigging doesn't exist either because he's never heard of it
[03:49:08.120 --> 03:49:13.720]  he says that it's absurd for me to suggest that election rigging is going on i mean this is what's
[03:49:13.720 --> 03:49:19.240]  absurd is to sit here and deny that it's even possible we've got registered dead voters we've
[03:49:19.240 --> 03:49:25.160]  got we know that they're pushing amnesty unconstitutionally to get people to vote we know that there are
[03:49:25.800 --> 03:49:31.160]  hundreds of thousands of people that are registered to vote in multiple states and now most recently
[03:49:31.160 --> 03:49:36.360]  we have reports about how they actually rig the voting machines we've got them folks we've caught
[03:49:36.360 --> 03:49:40.600]  them i'm just out here asking people what they think i'm seeing if anybody's engaged if anybody's
[03:49:40.600 --> 03:49:45.320]  awake and what do we get we get election officials that come out here and try to intimidate us from
[03:49:45.320 --> 03:49:49.640]  asking these questions and you know what here's the thing about this guy honestly i i'm making this
[03:49:49.640 --> 03:49:55.240]  assumption my guess is by the way he was talking to us and trying to bash donald trump he probably
[03:49:55.240 --> 03:50:01.640]  likes hillary clinton but but but either way what this guy's deal is and you heard it oh i've been
[03:50:01.640 --> 03:50:06.360]  an election official for 20 years i've been doing this for decades i know what i'm doing so what
[03:50:06.360 --> 03:50:10.840]  what so it doesn't matter how long you've been doing it for whatever reason you've been doing
[03:50:10.840 --> 03:50:15.800]  this for so long and you've ignored this evidence okay we have it all now so it doesn't matter how
[03:50:15.800 --> 03:50:20.920]  long you've been an election official we have the evidence we don't trust the results and we're going
[03:50:20.920 --> 03:50:25.960]  to keep a close eye on this and it's not absurd at all but he has threatened to call the authorities
[03:50:25.960 --> 03:50:30.280]  call the constable says we're breaking the law even though we've done nothing of the sort folks
[03:50:30.280 --> 03:50:34.520]  i've done no electioneering here at all but he threatened to call the authorities he's been
[03:50:34.520 --> 03:50:39.080]  bothering us so i'm not surprised these are the kind of election years that uh election officials
[03:50:39.080 --> 03:50:44.600]  that we deal with in texas it's really sad we're just trying to maintain the integrity of the election
[03:50:44.600 --> 03:50:50.600]  and election officials want to demonize us and get us booted from outside early voting
[03:50:50.600 --> 03:50:55.000]  station okay that's pretty much the end of it right there uh i'm going to tell you when you
[03:50:55.000 --> 03:50:59.560]  come back from break what you can do in your state to hold your officials feet to the fire to make
[03:50:59.560 --> 03:51:05.160]  sure we don't get stolen is more than just a heart tonic most basic diseases are caused by

[03:54:08.120 --> 03:54:22.040]  All right in our last segment we covered the election fraud that's going on and how we had
[03:54:22.040 --> 03:54:27.320]  Bev Harris just earlier this week prove that it could easily be done at the central locations
[03:54:27.320 --> 03:54:32.520]  for these voting machines and at the state level at the national level can all be done with percentages
[03:54:32.520 --> 03:54:38.280]  by having using decimal points and fractions now we went yesterday to the governor's office
[03:54:38.280 --> 03:54:44.200]  to talk to Greg Abbott our governor here in Texas and ask him is he going to enforce basic
[03:54:44.200 --> 03:54:47.960]  election law and these are the two questions we want to ask him guys go ahead and pull this up on
[03:54:47.960 --> 03:54:54.680]  the overhead camera it has proven that programs exist on voting machines to change voting results
[03:54:54.680 --> 03:55:01.000]  will governor Abbott demand all election laws be followed and direct counties to print paper backup
[03:55:01.000 --> 03:55:06.200]  results results tapes and at the polling locations before the equipment leaves the
[03:55:06.200 --> 03:55:09.800]  building for early voting and on election day so that's two spots where we wanted before
[03:55:10.680 --> 03:55:16.120]  before the early voting results are counted and on election day and will government will governor Abbott
[03:55:16.120 --> 03:55:22.200]  demand counties produce legal ballot images for recounts for the elections this November a ballot
[03:55:22.200 --> 03:55:28.360]  image is what is a picture of the actual ballot that you take and so we were given a card by a
[03:55:28.360 --> 03:55:33.320]  Mac Walker his press assistant and called him several times today hasn't returned our calls yet
[03:55:33.320 --> 03:55:36.760]  let's go ahead and show his number maybe some other people can get him on the phone and ask
[03:55:36.760 --> 03:55:41.640]  these questions there's his direct number and there's his cell he's a government public servant
[03:55:41.640 --> 03:55:46.200]  he's supposed to answer your calls we called him way after lunchtime and before lunchtime
[03:55:46.200 --> 03:55:51.400]  and let's see if we can maybe get him to answer some of these questions will the state of Texas
[03:55:51.400 --> 03:55:56.200]  uphold election laws that are on the books these are laws that are on on the books they exist as
[03:55:56.200 --> 03:56:02.200]  election laws here in Texas will they uphold them will they allow the the head of elections here in
[03:56:02.200 --> 03:56:07.160]  Texas Keith Ingram who's gone around and told precincts and counties that they do not have to
[03:56:07.160 --> 03:56:11.480]  keep these ballot images that they they do not have to keep these backup records so then they
[03:56:11.480 --> 03:56:17.080]  could be stolen later on that's what's going to happen if we don't hold these people's feet to the
[03:56:17.080 --> 03:56:20.280]  fire and then they could put in whoever they want whenever they want that's what it's all about
[03:56:20.280 --> 03:56:24.840]  it's about keeping the establishment in charge i want to go to our last caller here i might have
[03:56:24.840 --> 03:56:28.600]  time for one more but this is steven in florida let's talk about what's next after the election go
[03:56:28.600 --> 03:56:34.680]  ahead steve make it quick yeah i just wanted to say there's no testament story about a guy named
[03:56:34.680 --> 03:56:43.000]  jihu and uh what he ended up doing anointed by god was he ended up bringing the demise of jezebel
[03:56:43.000 --> 03:56:48.600]  if you guys who research this i really believe that Hillary's favorite bible character is jezebel
[03:56:48.600 --> 03:56:55.320]  the most wicked woman in scripture and one of the most wicked in history i believe she's modeled
[03:56:55.320 --> 03:57:01.080]  herself after this woman she was the real power behind a have flown just like hillary's then with
[03:57:01.080 --> 03:57:08.280]  bill and she had an egotistical and you know aspiration to be in charge but the thing is
[03:57:08.280 --> 03:57:14.280]  god pronounced judgment on her because of what she did shedding innocent blood and i believe that
[03:57:14.280 --> 03:57:22.600]  way back when hillary had that case where she defended a uh rapist against this girl that
[03:57:22.600 --> 03:57:28.040]  uh you know that uh alex interviewed just a cat he's shouting she crossed the line way back then
[03:57:28.600 --> 03:57:34.200]  and in revelation it talks about this woman that fit on the beast of world government
[03:57:34.200 --> 03:57:40.760]  and god puts it in their hearts to destroy her because it's his judgment on her i think hillary
[03:57:40.760 --> 03:57:46.120]  i i agree with you uh steven and she's never gone back from that point she's always stayed
[03:57:46.120 --> 03:57:51.880]  close to home uh being an evil manipulative person that she's always been so alex you
[03:57:51.880 --> 03:57:55.480]  want to jump in here at the last word now i just want to interrupt people like always do
[03:57:55.480 --> 03:57:59.640]  i can't believe obama claims that hillary's for feminists when she's connected to bill clinton
[03:57:59.640 --> 03:58:04.120]  the pedophile and the lila express and the islamist is abusing women we're gonna do a facebook
