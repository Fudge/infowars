[00:00.000 --> 00:14.120]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones

[00:36.680 --> 00:43.560]  in the year 2016 on this Monday edition thank you so much for joining us on the 1st of February
[00:43.560 --> 00:49.480]  2016 we're going to be live here for the next four hours and we have our own mckel failen
[00:49.480 --> 00:57.160]  in studio investigative journalist who's big on the hacker beat breaking that nasa was indeed
[00:57.160 --> 01:04.280]  hacked drone hijacked by the white hat hackers and steered out to see to illustrate the giant
[01:04.280 --> 01:10.120]  gaping holes in government security and it's now been confirmed that nasa indeed was hacked
[01:10.120 --> 01:15.800]  our story is still on drudge report dot com an enduring link up there since yesterday hackers
[01:15.800 --> 01:23.160]  allegedly don't know now it's confirmed hijacked drone after massive data breach at nasa hackers
[01:23.160 --> 01:33.240]  released 631 aircraft and radar videos 2143 flight logs and data on 2414 employees as well as
[01:33.240 --> 01:39.240]  hijacking or remote controlling a drone which they can do with all your big new aircraft also have
[01:39.240 --> 01:45.720]  the hijacking capabilities in them as well that's what the remote control systems are based on is
[01:45.720 --> 01:50.360]  autopilot that's coming up for like 30 minutes in the third hour we're gonna have Richard Reeves
[01:50.360 --> 01:56.920]  at a trump rally that kicks off at about 130 central he'll be there talking to folks and also
[01:56.920 --> 02:01.400]  we'll be carrying some of trump's speech Richard Reeves will pop in before that he's also again
[02:01.400 --> 02:08.840]  in Iowa there for the caucuses that are starting as we speak so there is so much to go over on
[02:08.840 --> 02:15.880]  that front and then paul joseph watson from london will be hosting the fourth hour today
[02:16.520 --> 02:22.520]  and undoubtedly there are at least 10 new articles usually five of mass raping stabbing
[02:22.520 --> 02:31.160]  killings looting's uh poopings that's another fun thing the uh the radical jihadis do because they
[02:31.160 --> 02:36.040]  come from the worst third world areas the middle east and so they jump in the public pools in
[02:36.040 --> 02:40.840]  the winter and begin fondling and defecating and urinating there's more of that going on i mean i
[02:40.840 --> 02:44.920]  don't want to get off in the gross stuff but it's like all these foreigners coming in from all over
[02:44.920 --> 02:51.480]  the third world that have never had toilets and so just everywhere there's human feces now and urine
[02:52.360 --> 02:58.520]  and well it's a cultural exchange program i guess so don't dare teach them about our culture
[02:58.520 --> 03:05.400]  or just accept theirs because that's what you do in political correctness uh is you basically
[03:05.400 --> 03:11.320]  kill uh any type of advanced culture uh and go to the lowest common denominator because that's
[03:11.320 --> 03:19.960]  what the social engineers uh want to have to begin with is total control now when we come
[03:19.960 --> 03:26.600]  back from beret i don't know how to go over all this news i'm gonna try my best and there's a
[03:26.600 --> 03:33.640]  phenomenon i i i read news at night i i i read news in the morning i i scan television i scan the
[03:33.640 --> 03:39.080]  different videos coming in the different emails i look at hundreds of pieces of data and then i come
[03:39.080 --> 03:44.120]  in here an hour before sometimes 20 minutes before and just thumb through hundreds of articles most
[03:44.120 --> 03:48.600]  of which have already seen and then a lot of which i haven't and then my head just starts spinning
[03:48.600 --> 03:54.760]  before i get on air and whatever focus i had kind of blast out into the ether by the time i get on
[03:54.760 --> 03:58.520]  air and i guess that's kind of a good thing the show's a success and it wakes a lot of people
[03:58.520 --> 04:06.520]  up so i guess you can't argue with that but i wanted to get into the secret of the hall of
[04:06.520 --> 04:15.240]  the mountain king here today and i more and more just thematically want to as an allegory as an
[04:15.240 --> 04:20.520]  archetype bring people into the hall of the mountain king and all of the secrets within
[04:20.520 --> 04:26.440]  him because that is the main allegory of the enemy it's one of their favorite secret symbols is the
[04:26.440 --> 04:36.280]  man in the mountain with the knowledge of the ages it's a another metaphor for elysium or
[04:36.280 --> 04:44.520]  mount olympus or breaking away and it's not gold and silver diamonds or rubies or fast cars or
[04:44.520 --> 04:50.840]  fine horses or women that are wealth in this world true wealth comes from ideas and understanding
[04:50.840 --> 04:55.960]  how systems work and the public is akin to helen keller in their ignorance
[04:58.600 --> 05:02.280]  microsoft's being technology has already called iowa victory for hillary clinton it
[05:02.280 --> 05:06.280]  result that has not gone unnoticed among bernie sanders supporters given that an app created
[05:06.280 --> 05:10.840]  by microsoft will help tally the vote during tonight's caucus using data from polls prediction
[05:10.840 --> 05:15.560]  markets and anonymized and aggregated search engine queries to predict its results microsoft
[05:15.560 --> 05:20.280]  believes hillary will win three out of the first four democratic primaries taking iowa south carolina
[05:20.280 --> 05:25.560]  in nevada while sanders takes new hampshire and is noted by paul joseph watson microsoft also correctly
[05:25.560 --> 05:31.000]  predicted the outcome of the 2015 academy awards the no vote for scotch independence and the outcome
[05:31.000 --> 05:35.640]  for over 95 percent of the 2014 us midterm elections and that track record is raising
[05:35.640 --> 05:39.480]  concerns among bernie sanders supporters who have pointed out potential conflict of interest
[05:39.480 --> 05:43.240]  given that precinct officials are using the app created by microsoft to count votes and
[05:43.240 --> 05:47.720]  report caucus results last week sanders iowa campaign manager questioned the impartiality of
[05:47.720 --> 05:52.040]  the app others have also pointed out that hackers could penetrate the cloud network on which the
[05:52.040 --> 05:57.240]  microsoft app runs in order to skew the vote visit info wars dot com for more election news this is

[08:54.360 --> 08:58.840]  much for joining us ladies and gentlemen we're going to be here for the next four hours anthony
[08:58.840 --> 09:04.360]  you already host the fourth hour i think he's popping in with paul joseph watson uh from the
[09:04.360 --> 09:09.960]  united kingdom so a lot of key information coming up today i don't know where to start but
[09:09.960 --> 09:15.400]  there's stories like this one on info wars dot com hillary claims she is not in the pocket of anyone
[09:15.400 --> 09:22.840]  after receiving six million from george soros alone last month and we have the cbs news club where she
[09:22.840 --> 09:27.800]  says she's not beholden to anyone no she's just gotten more money from goldman sacks jp morgan
[09:27.800 --> 09:35.480]  and all these big globalist operations than all other candidates combined so she's an outsider
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.680]  and she's going to stand up for women because she really cares about you just like obama
[09:40.680 --> 09:46.360]  stood up for black people and doubled their unemployment basically absolutely turned us
[09:46.360 --> 09:50.920]  back on those communities that are some of the most government dependent out there for government
[09:50.920 --> 09:59.640]  jobs programs just basically ended those because that makes you all the more on your knees doesn't it
[09:59.640 --> 10:03.400]  so we'll be getting to that clip hillary claims she is not in the pocket of anyone
[10:04.200 --> 10:09.320]  after receiving six million from soros just last month yeah they have quoted investigative
[10:09.320 --> 10:14.520]  journalist at media matters that's openly funded by soros and run by the white house that mean they
[10:14.520 --> 10:19.480]  brag that they get talking points every week from the white house and meet with the white house
[10:19.480 --> 10:23.960]  uh the head of it was the former transition head of the white house for obama and then
[10:24.920 --> 10:28.760]  a few years ago they said we want to have investigative journalists talked to alec shones
[10:28.760 --> 10:33.160]  who want to be fair and balanced and i knew it was a big joke but i wanted to be able just to
[10:33.160 --> 10:38.360]  hear what the what the media matters folks would say so i get on the phone with them
[10:38.920 --> 10:43.720]  and it's the editor of media matters and i go hey listen you got three million this year from
[10:43.720 --> 10:49.960]  George soros alone and he's your number one funder and he's a nazi war criminal oh no he's not
[10:49.960 --> 11:00.520]  and we don't get any money from him so i pulled up federal donation information online just just
[11:00.520 --> 11:06.840]  searched it in the federal database which anybody can do online for george soros funding media
[11:06.840 --> 11:12.760]  matters and then it took me to wikipedia that had links to the actual federal register where it set
[11:12.760 --> 11:17.880]  it and i said well here's here's four or five million just the last year and here's six million
[11:17.880 --> 11:23.160]  before that and ten million to help set it up he goes ha ha you're funny you got another conspiracy
[11:23.160 --> 11:29.160]  theory for me and i went so i'm on the federal government's own website and you're saying george
[11:29.160 --> 11:34.280]  soros doesn't fund you he said that's right sort of giggling and i said this this interview is over
[11:36.760 --> 11:42.440]  that's how dumb they think you are but it's like the gas lighting techniques the cia talks about
[11:42.440 --> 11:45.720]  where you slap somebody across the face
[11:48.200 --> 11:51.960]  and you have somebody else with you generally and the person says how dare you slap me and the
[11:51.960 --> 11:57.720]  other person laughs and they go we didn't slap you and some people are so suggestible with mass
[11:57.720 --> 12:03.000]  Stockholm syndrome that they will actually then believe they're mentally ill and insane
[12:03.000 --> 12:08.360]  and they'll just sit there and go there's no world government oh didn't call for world government
[12:08.360 --> 12:15.320]  davos didn't call for world government there is no plan to get your guns obama care is free
[12:15.320 --> 12:20.200]  there are no death panels and then one week after obama care passes cover of news week
[12:20.200 --> 12:26.040]  the case for killing granny and you bet their death panels and they're good and we're gonna kill
[12:26.040 --> 12:31.480]  you deader than i have her and bill gates gets up in front of you know these teacher conventions and
[12:31.480 --> 12:39.960]  goes um if we don't give someone end of life care um that's 10 teachers we can hire as if you're
[12:39.960 --> 12:45.640]  going to get the bounty of killing this person it shows the teachers kind of rocking back and
[12:45.640 --> 12:52.680]  forth in their seats getting getting getting real excited because oh my knee and the and
[12:52.680 --> 12:57.240]  they're so decadent they're so slothful they're so weak they're so evil they're so parasitic
[12:57.240 --> 13:03.640]  they're so predatory at a base level they just fantasize about not treating people and people
[13:03.640 --> 13:11.080]  dying and them getting some of the loot as if you you spineless ugly stupid people would get
[13:11.080 --> 13:17.640]  anything from your devilish master they can't wait to tear you into little pieces you fools you
[13:17.640 --> 13:27.080]  dishonorable weak scum as if you can do something to the least of us and it won't be done to you
[13:27.080 --> 13:32.680]  better for you to tie a millstone around your neck and cast it to the deepest ocean let me translate
[13:32.680 --> 13:38.200]  that better for you to tie a giant boulder around your chicken neck with a rope around your neck
[13:38.200 --> 13:44.280]  and throw it into a 5 000 foot deep ocean in the marionnes trench because it's 14 000 feet or whatever
[13:44.280 --> 13:52.920]  it is all right before i go off into a rant excuse me let me just do this we've never gotten through
[13:52.920 --> 13:57.400]  more than 20 stories but i've got a couple hundreds here let's just try to read headlines these are
[13:57.400 --> 14:02.280]  not even the most important in order bdc scientists get gene editing go ahead
[14:04.280 --> 14:08.040]  will be illegal for scientists to implant modified embryos into women
[14:10.040 --> 14:13.640]  but they've already been growing and other animals for at least 30 years
[14:13.640 --> 14:19.480]  but now they're getting around to telling the slaves there's a big rollout right now about
[14:19.480 --> 14:28.600]  how much fun it is of course i began about three months ago a secret plan to actually legally and
[14:28.600 --> 14:35.160]  lawfully get inside these and actually show you i wonder why they're suddenly admitting it to everyone
[14:35.160 --> 14:41.240]  psychological inoculation for when it comes out people will just say wasn't that the last episode
[14:41.240 --> 14:55.640]  of x-files but they always with the x-men and the x-files the mutation has magical powers no it's
[14:55.640 --> 15:02.920]  grown up like a ham inside a cow and then it gets dissected it doesn't you know shoot fireballs
[15:02.920 --> 15:08.920]  across the room see just like the biometrics and cars and the tracker boxes and everything
[15:08.920 --> 15:13.720]  is meant to be fun and cool and it's suddenly there and oh we're gonna start taxing you with it but
[15:13.720 --> 15:19.640]  only the nicest Mercedes had it 10 years ago and then oh the the lowest level Mercedes and then
[15:19.640 --> 15:25.320]  the lowest level Toyota and you pay for it and it's so cool and so convenient so the subconscious
[15:25.320 --> 15:30.600]  message is let them genetically engineer you're gonna shoot fireballs you're gonna fly you're
[15:30.600 --> 15:45.160]  gonna be like spider-man no no you're going to be infertile and your children are gonna have
[15:45.160 --> 15:50.520]  low IQs and they're not gonna have children and the globalists are going to declare victory against
[15:50.520 --> 16:01.880]  you and your seed if you let them so that's one article excuse me I guess I didn't do what I said
[16:01.880 --> 16:07.720]  I do I just went to one article out of more than 200 a day one and they're all just as important
[16:10.680 --> 16:15.080]  people like why do you keep obsessing over embryos and animals oh I don't know I don't
[16:15.080 --> 16:19.400]  know the hundreds of horrible reasons it's so deadly the dehumanization what's coming next
[16:19.400 --> 16:24.840]  what are they doing we don't know the zoological crossover viruses and bacterial mutagens that
[16:24.840 --> 16:28.840]  are already causing mass plagues across the earth that they're quietly trying to downplay
[16:31.960 --> 16:36.920]  oh here's another little juicy for you I've had scientists on 20 years ago breaking this down
[16:36.920 --> 16:42.920]  Alzheimer's can be transmitted from one person to another new evidence suggests Alzheimer's is a cloud
[16:42.920 --> 16:52.120]  name a catch all for exploding neurological disorders but yes mutated mold and mutated
[16:52.120 --> 17:02.920]  different fungus and mutated bacteria and mutated nanotech crystalline structures are spreading
[17:02.920 --> 17:10.840]  in mammal brains everywhere and now there's neurological disorders up over tens of thousands
[17:10.840 --> 17:16.040]  of percentage and then they just sit there and tell you everything's okay bye bye bluebird
[17:17.400 --> 17:23.480]  yeah you gotta laugh at all this oh I thought it was aluminum in the pots I thought it was oh no
[17:23.480 --> 17:31.320]  they're finding that that there's crystal structures not just like the mad cow but it's in the same
[17:31.320 --> 17:38.760]  class that stay on the scalpels of course it's been known for decades the elite when they have
[17:38.760 --> 17:44.120]  brain surgery they go to elite high-level hospitals the public doesn't even have access to in most
[17:44.120 --> 17:53.320]  cases or a wing the public doesn't have access to and brand new surgical steel and titanium
[17:54.520 --> 17:58.760]  systems are used and when they're done they're sold into an aftermarket
[17:59.560 --> 18:07.720]  back out but they don't have scalpels or other devices with metal in their bodies that have
[18:07.720 --> 18:15.880]  ever cut on anybody else and it's because of these natural nanotech type formations in the
[18:15.880 --> 18:21.080]  world in the galaxy in the universe that they're trying to mimic with nanotech but are simply
[18:21.080 --> 18:32.360]  different forms of crystals just try oh that's two articles let me continue here
[18:32.360 --> 18:41.080]  oh look at this why is nobody nailing Obama for this huge bald-faced lie
[18:42.120 --> 18:45.960]  that he was just caught in I don't know because they've conditioned us to accept it
[18:45.960 --> 18:52.440]  we'll get into that oh EU leaders claim no link between cologne sex attacks and migrants
[18:52.440 --> 18:58.840]  even though the police admit it was all muslim migrant men it doesn't matter because the government
[18:58.840 --> 19:04.280]  said it didn't exist I walk right up punch you in the nose your nose is bleeding I go nobody punched
[19:04.280 --> 19:11.480]  you in the nose you're a conspiracy theorist imagine if you want to know the secrets of the
[19:11.480 --> 19:16.520]  universe they just tell you they don't exist there is nothing but TV and if you say I question
[19:16.520 --> 19:20.600]  known liars you're a conspiracy theorist what an ultimate brainwashing technique
[19:23.160 --> 19:27.480]  okay we're gonna get into Iowa when we come back and a lot of people say man why don't you be more
[19:27.480 --> 19:34.120]  positive you know I am positive about humanity if we admit how much trouble we're in and activate
[19:34.120 --> 19:39.000]  our survival instinct and stop being nihilistic and stop giving up as the spirit of the world is

[24:15.880 --> 24:21.080]  that's some really interesting and informative guests going to be joining us throughout the
[24:21.080 --> 24:27.480]  week via Skype via phone in person in studio we've got Richard Reeves obviously in Iowa until
[24:27.480 --> 24:33.000]  tomorrow he's going to be popping in and also by nearing some of our live coverage tonight
[24:33.640 --> 24:40.200]  after the news of what's unfolding on that front as well at info wars dot com and prison
[24:40.200 --> 24:46.040]  planet dot com i shot a little tongue-in-cheek piece last night right before i went live on the
[24:46.040 --> 24:52.840]  radio for the sunday show at four o'clock called trump wins iowa in landslide and that little
[24:52.840 --> 25:01.720]  video has got 141 thousand views just on facebook since last night but the reason i point that out
[25:01.720 --> 25:08.680]  is trump in almost every poll has gone from neck and neck or behind crews to three to five points
[25:08.680 --> 25:17.000]  ahead of him and trump has 10 15 20 point leads 30 point leads in places like new hampshire in
[25:17.000 --> 25:24.360]  places like michigan in places like new york he is the absolute total frontrunner and when i watch
[25:24.360 --> 25:28.440]  fox and cnn and all of it monitoring them because i've been watching more because the election
[25:28.440 --> 25:32.440]  obviously then i've been watching hours of it a day probably with it on the background
[25:32.440 --> 25:38.840]  and i turn it up when the uh when they come back from break and it's just the same mindless
[25:38.840 --> 25:43.880]  talking points over and over again hillary's in trouble oh my gosh watergate which is true
[25:45.000 --> 25:51.800]  and what will the democrats do but hillary is ahead of bernie and she's going to beat him
[25:51.800 --> 25:59.560]  and donald trump donald trump you know he's he's not really surging and and that's not what's true
[25:59.560 --> 26:06.040]  so so so they're really really trying to put the kibosh on trump and that tells you everything you
[26:06.040 --> 26:11.400]  know the establishment is deathly afraid of trump he is an unknown country an unknown quantity i'm
[26:11.400 --> 26:14.920]  not saying he's perfect i'm not saying i completely trust him because he is a loose cannon but
[26:15.480 --> 26:19.400]  we know what we've got as i've said a hundred times with hillary and jeb bush and and bernie
[26:19.400 --> 26:25.400]  sanders i mean imagine in america a guy goes out and has crowds of up to 50 000 people in every state
[26:25.400 --> 26:33.400]  for quote socialism when we know socialism floats like a lead balloon i mean it is a disaster
[26:34.360 --> 26:39.480]  everywhere it's tried but libya and that's because there was i've always said historically only a
[26:39.480 --> 26:48.200]  strong man philosopher dictator can can can take something like a national resource like oil
[26:48.200 --> 26:55.480]  sell it and then put it into actual education actual public works actual libraries aquifers
[26:56.120 --> 27:03.880]  and national industries and he really did that and i'm not lionizing muhmer qaddafi
[27:04.680 --> 27:12.280]  it's just a fact that that is the case it works nowhere because special interests come in they
[27:12.280 --> 27:16.840]  take control of the socialism they take control of the distribution and they begin shutting down
[27:16.840 --> 27:21.720]  all their competition giving government contracts to their friends that then kills competition
[27:23.000 --> 27:29.080]  scarcity starts up look at venezuela look at russia look at everywhere china you could say
[27:29.080 --> 27:34.840]  has worked but it's been communism on the top really fascism with a tiny group of generals
[27:34.840 --> 27:40.600]  and party members becoming billionaires with a huge mass of hardworking entrepreneurial people
[27:40.600 --> 27:48.520]  culturally free marketers culturally very materialistic very scientific that's doing
[27:48.520 --> 27:57.880]  the stereotypes for reasons hardworking smart entrepreneurial chinese and can grow plants in
[27:57.880 --> 28:03.160]  a desert you know we're really smart hardworking people but they're held as slaves for thousands
[28:03.160 --> 28:09.800]  of years by imperial elites and just like russia went from imperial elites to communism china went
[28:09.800 --> 28:17.880]  from imperial elites to communism america went from imperial elites to 1776 and free market and
[28:17.880 --> 28:22.680]  ended up having more than half the wealth in the world almost all the patents the trailblazers the
[28:22.680 --> 28:31.480]  toughest people in a fight the most inventions i mean the whole world from japan to france to russia
[28:31.480 --> 28:36.360]  to chile go back 200 years ago 100 years ago america was the best america was the best america
[28:36.360 --> 28:41.400]  was the best america was the best our sports our culture everything dominated because it just gave
[28:41.400 --> 28:50.680]  humans a little bit of freedom a little bit compared to other societies and there were articles in
[28:50.680 --> 28:57.080]  england and other places saying 200 years ago if the american system doesn't get taken over
[28:57.080 --> 29:04.520]  and if it keeps operating empires will fall to its mercantile modern free market system that's how
[29:04.520 --> 29:09.720]  they kind of saw it was mercantile even though it wasn't but you can read those articles and so
[29:09.720 --> 29:14.920]  british intelligence and others came over you can look this up by 1900 made it fashionable in the
[29:14.920 --> 29:21.080]  newspapers to speak with the british accent had the the east coast robber barons began to speak
[29:21.080 --> 29:25.960]  with english accents they called it an atlantic accent pushed from hall the third and got everyone
[29:25.960 --> 29:33.400]  into it sent in british intelligence into new york into dc set up pratt house in 1922 in new york
[29:33.400 --> 29:38.680]  and and took over we were taken over by the british empire at that point but be clear that
[29:38.680 --> 29:45.000]  doesn't mean the british people but the british empire system of the roth child that they hijacked
[29:45.000 --> 29:54.280]  in 1815 is in current control we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[29:54.280 --> 30:02.840]  network islamic state is threatening to launch an attack on london so terrible that it will turn
[30:02.840 --> 30:08.040]  children's hair white the extremist group published an article in its arabic language newspaper stating
[30:08.040 --> 30:12.920]  a doomstay attack would take place on british soil isis claimed the uk would receive the lion
[30:12.920 --> 30:17.080]  share of its european terrorist attacks threat is apparently a response to uk's decision to
[30:17.080 --> 30:21.320]  extend its aerial bombing campaign against the islamic state it also promises to carry out follow
[30:21.320 --> 30:26.440]  up attacks to the paris massacre in november which left 130 dead and more than 300 injured the islamic
[30:26.440 --> 30:31.000]  state finally referenced a verse of the korean which discusses judgment day stating the attack on
[30:31.000 --> 30:35.320]  britain will be so horrific it will turn children's hair to white the threat will no doubt feel
[30:35.320 --> 30:40.120]  concerns that jihadists are exploiting the refugee crisis to slip into e u undetected by using fake
[30:40.120 --> 30:43.960]  passports so they can launch terrorist attacks on british soil if there is a terrorist attack it's
[30:43.960 --> 30:48.040]  likely the uk government will exploit it to enact a police state just like france especially
[30:48.040 --> 30:52.520]  considering that nato has been arming and funding isis as a proxy army gets syria for quite some

[33:33.480 --> 33:35.960]  so i might as well put some action in my life
[33:39.960 --> 33:40.840]  breaking the law
[33:40.840 --> 33:47.480]  breaking the law breaking the law well a tyranny is the law breaking the law it is our duty before
[33:47.480 --> 33:53.160]  god to break it breaking the law but the elites controlling our country they write the laws that
[33:53.160 --> 33:58.840]  are unconstitutional many of them and then flagrantly break them all they want i've got a clip here
[33:59.640 --> 34:03.320]  with new york attorney when they're asking them about money laundering and corruptions from 60
[34:03.320 --> 34:09.080]  minutes the lawyer says the top lawyer says we run the country we can do whatever we want it's
[34:09.080 --> 34:13.640]  like jim kramer admitted i guess a decade or so ago in a big interview he said yeah
[34:13.640 --> 34:16.200]  i used to break the law all the time we used to fix and rig everything
[34:17.800 --> 34:22.920]  that was after the statute of limitations was up and he hadn't traded stocks or securities for a decade
[34:26.040 --> 34:30.760]  so that's what's happening here ladies and gentlemen the elites and their companies are exempt
[34:30.760 --> 34:36.360]  from obama care the elites are exempt from the major taxes in fact i have a clip i want to play
[34:36.360 --> 34:44.600]  here in a moment first where hillary talks about the warren buffett rule that the quote wealth
[34:44.600 --> 34:52.120]  should come from those that have it so let me see if there is a goose that symbolizes free market
[34:52.120 --> 34:58.680]  capitalism and innovation and competitiveness and ideas and it produces two golden eggs every morning
[34:58.680 --> 35:07.480]  does the saying that the wealth should come from who produces it is like saying take a hatchet
[35:07.480 --> 35:13.400]  and cut it open and then you get the one or two eggs that are in there that it hadn't laid yet
[35:13.960 --> 35:18.680]  and then you got a dead goose so instead of getting a thousand golden eggs or more
[35:20.920 --> 35:27.640]  you get a couple of golden eggs it's called a conquest looting economy versus a free market
[35:27.640 --> 35:32.280]  economy and there's always a mix of the two historically this is alex jones economics
[35:32.280 --> 35:38.040]  but this is this is what you study history is really going on cronies insider elite groups
[35:38.040 --> 35:43.560]  controlling things ruling by force always consolidating never having enough power
[35:43.560 --> 35:48.120]  their own strata of elites under them setting up their own little petty empires
[35:50.680 --> 35:53.080]  destroying productivity destroying confidence
[35:53.080 --> 36:00.040]  why should you build a business if somebody's just going to take it you go to third world countries
[36:00.680 --> 36:05.320]  that never got a shot at freedom whether it be in eastern europe or latin america you talk to
[36:05.320 --> 36:10.200]  people they're just as smart as we are smarter great artist intelligent but they don't want to
[36:10.200 --> 36:14.920]  produce anything if somebody's just going to take it from them or if they try to other people with a
[36:14.920 --> 36:24.360]  socialist mindset get mad at them and try to take what they've got so the response is don't produce
[36:24.360 --> 36:28.840]  and i guess in a way the bible's right the meek will then inherit the earth the earth the free
[36:28.840 --> 36:38.840]  marketers build but first the free marketers build the earth build the civilization and then the gang
[36:38.840 --> 36:46.200]  parasites come and they loot it and they pull it down and they burn to the ground then they
[36:46.200 --> 36:53.080]  point at the ruins their grandchildren do and say our ancestors built that when you didn't build it
[36:54.680 --> 37:01.880]  obama inverts reality and tells business owners whether whether they be a poet or an author or a
[37:01.880 --> 37:10.120]  hair cutting facility or or or a gas station you didn't build that as if humanity collectively
[37:10.120 --> 37:17.480]  didn't build it as if innovation didn't build it as if competition didn't build it he said the state
[37:17.480 --> 37:25.400]  built it and yes the state can sit there and steal massive amounts of our capital our labor our work
[37:25.400 --> 37:31.880]  as if it's a palette of paints and put the different colors out of our energy our creations our
[37:31.880 --> 37:38.200]  inventions and then paint on a palette and claim the painting is theirs but it's done in our blood
[37:38.200 --> 37:44.280]  and our guts and our tears and our sweat not the state and when you start hearing the state saying
[37:44.840 --> 37:52.280]  it is the fount of wisdom and the fount of civilization you know you're entering a communist hell pit
[37:52.280 --> 37:56.840]  and let me tell you something i see a lot of Bernie Sanders stickers around austin texas
[37:58.680 --> 38:01.320]  and i see these people and many of them have bumper stickers that say
[38:02.840 --> 38:07.720]  i like to pay taxes because i like civilization i forget who said the quote
[38:10.920 --> 38:17.320]  yes groups of people can get together and decide to vote to take a portion of their
[38:17.320 --> 38:24.360]  money collectively to build something for the public good a canal a river a lake an electrical
[38:24.360 --> 38:32.200]  system a museum a road but not oh notice the more socialist it gets we build the roads give
[38:32.200 --> 38:37.960]  them a special interest call that privatization we build racetracks and then give it to the
[38:37.960 --> 38:47.800]  private interest they build museums and then charge you to go into them they they build libraries and
[38:47.800 --> 38:55.080]  then charge you to go into them but that's the old vestigial end of trying to build a civilization
[38:55.080 --> 39:02.600]  the point is a rich free market with low taxes and low regulation on individuals produces a giant
[39:02.600 --> 39:09.240]  cream top off which you can take some money and build infrastructure but you don't jack up taxes
[39:09.240 --> 39:15.960]  to 80 percent and then have an infrastructure it collapses french infrastructure is collapsing
[39:16.920 --> 39:23.960]  the the the immigrant migrant darlings are running around engaged in thousands of robberies and
[39:23.960 --> 39:29.400]  carjackings and lootings on the highways a day that was in french news agency last week the country
[39:29.400 --> 39:35.560]  is in collapse it has the highest suicide rate in the world now above japan
[39:38.600 --> 39:44.760]  the french government two years ago imposed a 101 tax on millionaires
[39:46.200 --> 39:52.280]  you say how is that possible it's meant to destroy wealth and how could you do something like that
[39:52.280 --> 39:57.400]  what elite would do that to themselves because they exempt themselves it came out four years
[39:57.400 --> 40:04.760]  ago that the french socialists selectively do not pay federal taxes and all of them to a person
[40:04.760 --> 40:09.880]  have basically been caught with giant swiss bank accounts of stolen money on top of it and they
[40:09.880 --> 40:16.840]  know their hardcore criminals it's not like they're corrupt and getting away with it they have taken
[40:16.840 --> 40:28.360]  over they rule you try to unseat them like marie lapin they arrest you they are the oligarchs
[40:28.360 --> 40:34.840]  and they are loved by the funding socialist masses who want hey you want three months of
[40:34.840 --> 40:39.080]  vacation you got it hey you want a 35 hour work with you got it guess what nobody's going to fix
[40:39.080 --> 40:43.240]  your leaking ceiling guess what there's no job for you now oh guess what the highway is falling
[40:43.240 --> 40:55.160]  apart 101 tax and they don't care that almost every movie star from france is left they don't care
[40:55.160 --> 41:01.720]  that almost every soccer star has left they don't care of their main media people have left they
[41:01.720 --> 41:06.280]  don't care because they want to depress it they want to run it in the ground like the french
[41:06.280 --> 41:11.880]  revolution till everything collapses and they're the only ones with money they're the only ones left
[41:11.880 --> 41:17.320]  standing and buy it all up and then they're going to make it imperial again and militaristic and
[41:17.320 --> 41:24.760]  right wing and they'll put a napoleon in mark my words it's a cycle it's what dark side
[41:24.760 --> 41:30.920]  illuminati are into and you can sit there and watch them doing it you go they're idiots they're
[41:30.920 --> 41:37.400]  imploding their own country they're no they're not you engage in siege and cut everyone else off
[41:37.400 --> 41:44.200]  the masses beg you more to take more of their rights because they think you're actually giving them
[41:44.200 --> 41:51.240]  something they they join you even more in the lottery ticket culture that if we just get the
[41:51.240 --> 41:55.560]  right socialist in you know where's all the free health care oh obama didn't deliver it but bernie
[41:55.560 --> 42:03.560]  sanders and hillary they will oh sarkozy didn't deliver so halan's gonna deliver and when he
[42:03.560 --> 42:10.440]  doesn't deliver oh somebody else will deliver when if you could just keep 60 70 percent of your own
[42:10.440 --> 42:18.920]  money that would deliver you into running your own life your own house your own car your own vacation
[42:20.440 --> 42:25.880]  your own decisions but see oh no no you've got to be on the government control even if you have a job
[42:25.880 --> 42:30.840]  you've got to be dictated to because that that private job is a government contract
[42:30.840 --> 42:37.320]  so you need to watch your behavior or you're gonna lose that job lose that pension well guess what
[42:37.320 --> 42:42.920]  because you all got quiet and you all went along the military the police the bureaucrats all over
[42:42.920 --> 42:49.000]  the world got in line to the globalist now you're gonna lose everything because a world of sheep
[42:49.000 --> 43:04.680]  will be ruled by good old lobo the wolf you want to be sheep you want to be dishonorable slaves
[43:05.400 --> 43:13.240]  you want to be fools good enjoy yourselves believe that arch communist with his sickening
[43:13.240 --> 43:21.960]  rhetoric knowing he's praying on people burning standards knowing full well the ultra elite that
[43:21.960 --> 43:29.080]  he badmouths all day are financing the socialist revolution are running the whole takeover and
[43:29.080 --> 43:40.200]  why is that again because they are exempt from their own system they are exempt they are above the
[43:40.200 --> 43:49.960]  law they have diplomatic and political immunity they are the new royalty
[43:54.120 --> 43:56.600]  they have the letter of mark not you
[43:59.560 --> 44:06.440]  and if people won't figure that out and see it with computers and robots and upscaling technology
[44:06.440 --> 44:13.560]  we should all be working 10 20 hours a week on really fun interesting projects and going to the
[44:13.560 --> 44:20.040]  stars and just having incredible medical developments that are guided by moral compass and being
[44:20.040 --> 44:26.040]  preparing ourselves to go to the next level of human development which is just unbelievably
[44:26.040 --> 44:31.800]  amazing not gonna happen the elite have stated in thousands of white papers that we've covered
[44:31.800 --> 44:36.920]  hundreds of them here that they decided that you're unwashed you're going to be drugged
[44:37.560 --> 44:43.800]  chemicalized entertained into a stupor and you're going to be given cancer and you're going to be
[44:44.440 --> 44:50.840]  phased out pretty soon though it'll be neurological disorder will be the main cause of death
[44:50.840 --> 44:59.400]  that infectious disease and they they tell you they're killing you and see they tell me they're
[44:59.400 --> 45:03.400]  killing me in all these books and i see them actually setting it up and put in the tracker
[45:03.400 --> 45:08.600]  boxes of the cars and just like a normal mammal i go oh get ready folks rally do something look
[45:08.600 --> 45:15.720]  at them and people are like shut up man cowboys are coming off baby and and then i'm the weirdo
[45:15.720 --> 45:24.840]  because as a normal man i'm just trying to survive and have a future for humanity people
[45:24.840 --> 45:33.880]  look and they go you care about other people you actually care my problem is
[45:37.400 --> 45:41.640]  you try to help a lot of people they don't want your help you try to show people the
[45:41.640 --> 45:44.200]  secrets of how things operate that are how to complain to you they don't want it
[45:46.040 --> 45:49.480]  they like the way they see the world and they don't care what's really there
[45:49.480 --> 45:56.040]  you know this isn't my opinion the stuff we cover here is a fact
[45:58.600 --> 46:04.120]  and the difference is now people know that's true they know that really it's worse than i'm
[46:04.120 --> 46:10.360]  saying that i don't have the words i don't have the verbal semantical
[46:10.360 --> 46:23.160]  phasaurus to paint you a picture of the abject horror that we're going into and right behind
[46:23.160 --> 46:33.080]  a paper thin wall are the nastiest most despicable most dehumanizing most horrifying things you
[46:33.080 --> 46:43.640]  could ever imagine i was told by a genetic engineer
[46:46.760 --> 46:50.600]  about a project they were on in england once and i never told the story on air because it's so
[46:50.600 --> 46:58.920]  fantastical oh god they had tanks people with gills and they were little babies and they were
[46:58.920 --> 47:03.320]  in there just gulping clawing at the sides you see a turtle at the zoo and it wants out you feel for
[47:03.320 --> 47:11.560]  it they got humanoids crossed with fish and stuff i mean we're screwed people i mean do you
[47:11.560 --> 47:16.200]  understand that and i know i keep obsessing because it's in the news what they're doing now
[47:16.200 --> 47:21.240]  they don't show it to you they just go yeah gestating on farms or embryos of humans growing
[47:21.240 --> 47:27.080]  in animals no it's beyond that they take them out they keep them alive and notice they go the only
[47:27.080 --> 47:33.480]  law is you don't put it in a real human woman and don't worry these creatures don't have any rights
[47:33.480 --> 47:39.560]  because they're not human and they're not animal they're in that phantom zone they're in that
[47:41.960 --> 47:48.840]  fifth dimension of the twilight zone and they're just opening the gates of hell
[47:50.200 --> 47:55.880]  and i just can't sit here and go along with all the pumps and the stupid hollywood people and
[47:55.880 --> 48:00.520]  everyone preening and driving their two hundred thousand dollars cars and getting off on being on
[48:00.520 --> 48:05.000]  tv i don't even hardly watch when i'm on television i hate it i hate this whole culture i hate the
[48:05.000 --> 48:12.280]  whole thing it means nothing to me it's all fake salt a facade and behind it are mad scientists

[48:19.560 --> 48:26.040]  holes huge cyclotrons splicing every plant animal on the known face of the earth and
[48:26.600 --> 48:31.000]  it's the most satanic rituals you can imagine those are satanic rituals
[48:32.360 --> 48:38.120]  detonating hundreds of high-powered hydrogen bombs in the 1960s in the upper atmosphere to see if
[48:38.120 --> 48:43.080]  they could detonate the earth's atmosphere and blow holes in the van helen radiation belt is so
[48:43.080 --> 48:51.560]  satanic splicing little babies with fish you satanic putting prions and all this garbage in our food
[48:51.560 --> 48:57.160]  is satanic you think real satanists go and just sit there and have sex with some hot chick on a

[55:17.240 --> 55:24.600]  not to be discussed all right since i mentioned it here's the uh hillary piece where she says
[55:24.600 --> 55:29.880]  that she can't be bought well i guess because you're already paid for i guess that is true of
[55:29.880 --> 55:34.920]  course whores aren't bought aren't they rented actually and i don't say you're a whore because
[55:34.920 --> 55:41.400]  you're a woman i call the political class whores because every criticism of her turns into an
[55:41.400 --> 55:45.640]  attack on women no i once had a newspaper asked me why do you call hillary clinton a whore
[55:47.000 --> 55:53.720]  well if she had no political whore i don't know what is and so is john bainer and obama and all
[55:53.720 --> 56:00.120]  the rest of it she's worse than that i mean in fact i don't want to put down prostitutes
[56:00.120 --> 56:05.880]  i i don't mean sexual whore i mean a whore to the establishment meanwhile six million
[56:05.880 --> 56:11.000]  the last month info wars dot com steve watson article hillary claims she is not in the pocket
[56:11.000 --> 56:18.200]  of anyone after receiving six million from soros last month let's go to that clip well look anybody
[56:18.200 --> 56:23.240]  who knows me knows i'm not in the pocket of anyone and thinks they can influence me uh
[56:23.240 --> 56:28.760]  certainly doesn't know me uh but what i do think is interesting is be a laugh track laid out the
[56:28.760 --> 56:34.440]  most comprehensive toughest effective plan to make sure wall street never wrecks main street again
[56:36.600 --> 56:41.560]  that's what paul krugman and barney frank and others have said but the really interesting part
[56:41.560 --> 56:47.160]  of this is how the republicans have now been running about six million dollars of ads against me
[56:47.880 --> 56:54.200]  billionaire hedge fund guys carl rove and others who are desperate to try to confuse democrats
[56:54.200 --> 57:01.320]  about who has the best plan and that's enough carl rove uh so what carl rove does is sit on top
[57:01.320 --> 57:08.280]  all the republican grassroots money and funnel it off oh carl rove doesn't like you oh boy
[57:08.280 --> 57:12.440]  you know the operative for the bushes that you call your family i mean just give me a break
[57:12.440 --> 57:15.640]  you cannot get more established than hillary clinton and that's why people are running the
[57:15.640 --> 57:19.560]  standards and i get it that's actually a good sign even though he's socialist but they'd run to a
[57:19.560 --> 57:26.440]  socialist over him over her uh briefly funding our operation we have the very best pharmaceuticals

[01:05:00.200 --> 01:05:04.680]  called Iowa a victory for hillary clinton a result that has not gone unnoticed among bernie sander
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:09.240]  supporters given that an app created by microsoft will help tally the vote during tonight's caucus
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:13.640]  using data from polls prediction markets and anonymized and aggregated search engine queries
[01:05:13.640 --> 01:05:18.120]  to predict its results microsoft believes hillary will win three out of the first four democratic
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:23.160]  primaries taking iowa south carolina and nevada while sanders takes new hampshire and is noted by
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:29.160]  paul joseph watson microsoft also correctly predicted the outcome of the 2015 academy awards the no vote
[01:05:29.160 --> 01:05:34.520]  for sky's independence and the outcome for over 95 percent of the 2014 us midterm elections and that
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:38.520]  track record is raising concerns among bernie sander supporters who have pointed out potential
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:42.840]  conflict of interest given that precinct officials are using the app created by microsoft to count
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:47.640]  votes and report caucus results last week sanders iowa campaign manager questioned the impartiality
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:52.040]  of the app others have also pointed out that hackers could penetrate the cloud network on which the
[01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:57.160]  microsoft app runs in order to skew the vote visit info wars dot com for more election news this is

[01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:02.840]  rapes them physically and then hillary rapes them psychologically i hope the enemies of this
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:08.840]  broadcast when you lie about us when you censor us when you attack us when you delist us when you
[01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:15.000]  do that you're shining on to the other side these people are all the devil let's be very
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:22.600]  blunt about this raise hell and demand accountability it is the most corrupt degenerate criminal
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:32.520]  government in american history from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:37.240]  we're proud of now moving forward toward the barrier the police have been telling everybody
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:44.120]  they're going to shoot if we don't move back their defeat will be ultimately a crushing war
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:52.680]  it was last week that we had dr frances boil the author of the us and un biological weapons
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:12:01.320]  treaty on to break down that his genetic engineer sources were saying that clearly zika had been
[01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:08.200]  souped up weaponized to be able to suddenly be passed via saliva or other sexual transmissions
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:15.640]  of bodily fluids it's now in the daily mail and other newspapers in england outbreak caused by
[01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:22.440]  release of genetically modified mosquitoes in brazil question mark we're posting this article
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:28.520]  right now with our interview with boil last friday that is so important that big interview came out
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:32.360]  on friday that's one of the worst days obviously is a friday afternoon but that's okay we're going
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:37.560]  to push this out to folks now because bill and melinda gates are heavily involved in the past
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:42.520]  with admitting they want to breed mosquitoes and they are now breeding them and releasing them
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:47.400]  that quote force genetic information into your body they call it vaccines
[01:12:49.320 --> 01:12:54.840]  no live viruses and things that change brain chemistry or viruses that attack fertility
[01:12:54.840 --> 01:12:59.560]  you know you know that's a bio weapon not a vaccine but the public's like i like the new
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:06.520]  vaccines i want the h pv that's genetically engineered doesn't protect you the insert says
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:13.320]  killed a bunch of people in the trials 10 years ago is banned all over the world but not in america
[01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:20.760]  and not in mexico and not in guatemala they go and they shoot up all those little girls
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:27.480]  with a vaccine directly linked to autoimmune disorders brain disorders infertility
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:36.600]  and of course death see if it's effective it's got to be able to hit somebody and lower fertility
[01:13:36.600 --> 01:13:40.680]  and then jack them up later but they don't know what hit them but you see sometimes folks are more
[01:13:40.680 --> 01:13:47.000]  susceptible so they die that day or they get paralyzed and die in a week and they're trying to
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:52.040]  gauge it where it's not you know not too obvious but when they do vaccine test a few years ago you
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:57.400]  know in poland and another one in czechoslovakia in the czech republic you know they gave what one
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:14:04.360]  in one facility 40 homeless men the flu vaccine and it killed what was it 29 of them was weaponized
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:10.920]  ferret flu i'm just throwing out there's hundreds of these this comes out the mainstream news
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:15.080]  there was an article last week vaccine suspended after you know it was something like
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:20.040]  60 of the kids collapsed and go to the hospital after they were given the shot oh i'm sure nothing's
[01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:28.440]  going on here i'm sorry i'm digressing do we have richard now negative i know richard is
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:33.800]  going through a secret service right now to cover big events that are coming up he's also
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.360]  going to be covering the trump event for us and he's going to be on with detailed reporting tonight
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:46.760]  we are going to have extended coverage of iowa and of new hampshire and then we'll only cover some
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:52.280]  of the other big events and of course election night and the conventions before that but i will be
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:59.080]  Skyping in from the hacienda and i do that for a reason if i get in this chair i kind of take
[01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:04.680]  over and it's obnoxious i personally like the job david night jukari jackson and leon macadoo and
[01:15:04.680 --> 01:15:08.920]  others do and and eric brane they're going to be here with caucus results and stuff but also
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.920]  playing a lot of special reports on other subjects as more data comes in they're not just going to
[01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:17.320]  talk about hillary's emails for 14 hours a day like fox news is doing and that's all they do
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:24.600]  then they ask the question is she lying it makes my headache to think about all the lies just on
[01:15:24.600 --> 01:15:31.560]  the emails first there was no private server then there were no classified emails and then in the
[01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:34.680]  email she tells them how to chop the top off to say they're not classified
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:43.640]  and and it's just it just gives me a headache see i'm getting a headache right now they caught
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:51.240]  el chopo with a 50 caliber rifle that then attorney general john p holdren i'm sorry that's the
[01:15:51.240 --> 01:16:04.600]  why our science are eric holder sent down there as we prepare to talk to richard let me plow back
[01:16:04.600 --> 01:16:11.400]  into the news and what's really important in iowa i have looked at the hundreds of scientific polls
[01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:15.560]  and the hundreds and hundreds of unscientific as many as you have the last few weeks
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:22.200]  and overwhelmingly trump came from a two points behind on average about three to five points ahead
[01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:31.000]  of cruce and trump is set to win he's already won by breaking away and doing his own event
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:36.200]  instead of the debate a big defeat of the mainstream media a populist signal of the
[01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:40.680]  uprising that's happening through the political system regardless of who trump is he's now that
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:45.000]  figurehead and that's why they're attacking him is when they attack him they're attacking populism
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:53.720]  you and i now let's expand on that microsoft is famous oh we were just talking about them and
[01:16:54.680 --> 01:16:58.600]  genetically engineered mosquitoes that bill gates give speeches at ted talk and goes
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:03.240]  we've got to save the earth and to do that we've got to bring this number down it shows humans
[01:17:03.240 --> 01:17:08.600]  down to zero and everybody laughs because they're in the little end club about eugenics so there's
[01:17:08.600 --> 01:17:13.160]  this dr evil guy with super secret government clearances with hundreds of billions tied up
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:21.960]  in secret programs i mean it's amazing and now they've just offered a free gift that worked
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:29.400]  out for troy didn't it when the trojans and the trojan war that really happened
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:37.080]  it was a big beautiful 50-foot horse they tore down a bunch of the ships built it around the
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:45.720]  mountainside brought it around the beach rolled it up and they had the troops inside the belly of
[01:17:45.720 --> 01:17:51.480]  the horse and they rolled the horse in and they came out of the belly of the horse and you know
[01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:57.960]  the rest of the story they lowered the front gate and in came the hordes and but oh don't worry
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:08.200]  microsoft they're so good they have given a free goodie a special app oh and guess what
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:16.040]  the app predicted today that hillary won oh last wednesday sanders was a cook
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:23.160]  no he's a cold-blooded economy he was a he was he was a conspiracy theorist for coming out and saying
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:27.160]  they can just determine whatever they want beforehand we've had all this blackbuck voting
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:31.640]  problem with diabol the rest of us been proven there's been fraud many elections and so saying
[01:18:31.640 --> 01:18:35.160]  there's been proven fraud before and that microsoft has been connected with the software
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:41.480]  companies that have backdoors in it you know that's a fact it's like saying it's like saying that
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:48.680]  jack the ripper was connected to slicing women up in london no no they just say that's a conspiracy
[01:18:48.680 --> 01:18:55.880]  theory and now even the hill newspaper and others are saying oh microsoft is on the hot seat boy
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:19:00.920]  there is something going on here well microsoft is all about hiding everything in plain view
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:08.680]  so here's the headline this is up on info wars dot com where they have now
[01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:15.400]  projected that hillary is the winner according to their app that's monitoring everyone and their
[01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:19.080]  activities because while it's on your phone it's monitoring what you click on what you do
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:24.920]  oh my gosh isn't it nice microsoft just gave us this free thing that tracks everything and now
[01:19:24.920 --> 01:19:30.360]  it's already saying hillary won so you better just go ahead and give it to hillary because you
[01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:34.360]  want to feel like you're a winner and be on the winning team microsoft calls isle over hillary
[01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:42.360]  before it helps count the vote sanders supporters concerned over impartiality really really that's
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:48.360]  like saying should judges own stock in private prison companies in their jurisdiction and then
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:54.120]  send people to those very prisons and then you catch the judges actually getting money from

[01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:34.760]  Alex Jones back live we're about to go to Richard Reeves in Des Moines, Iowa ahead of the big caucuses
[01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:44.520]  that kick off today Sanders in many polls is overtaken Hillary he is trouncing her by 15 16 17
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:51.640]  points in different polls in places uh in other sectors of the country like New Hampshire but
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:58.920]  don't worry microsoft has given the free trojan horse system that the both parties are using
[01:24:58.920 --> 01:25:05.880]  republicans and democrats without asking anybody to tally who the winner is oh how convenient and
[01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:12.760]  there's an info wars dot com story microsoft calls iowa for hillary before it helps count the vote
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:15.880]  using the app and its other systems of forecasting
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.840]  now they're using their Bing technology and association whether you know how google admits
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:29.800]  they can predict the future microsoft can order something before you even order it and already
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:34.920]  have it packaged in shipping a day before because it has an algorithm that predicts the future
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:42.440]  oh we're not in kansas anymore but then also when they can start predicting the future they
[01:25:42.440 --> 01:25:48.280]  can manipulate the future or falsely call the future creating the perception that she's already
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:57.400]  won so people cast their ballot for her who are on the razor's edge this is tampering with the
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:26:04.600]  election nakedly in your face just like tpp global secret treaties we get it it's signing over all
[01:26:04.600 --> 01:26:11.560]  our rights after it's already been signed on to globally amazing Richard Reeves joins us from
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:16.280]  Des Moines iowa i believe because i know you're gonna be back with us later in the day at a
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:21.880]  trump event but you've also been some other events i richard a lot of new developments tell us what's
[01:26:21.880 --> 01:26:26.440]  uh happening what's coming up after the break and then we'll get back into the uh hacking uh
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:33.880]  situation alex richard Reeves reporting from cedar rabbits iowa and we are already set up to
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:39.160]  livestream a trump event here coming up he'll be speaking at 130 uh that's why we got delayed
[01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:46.200]  because the secret service service protocol here but alex you are so right bernie sanders his
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:52.520]  campaign should be filing lawsuits today iowa people the precinct chairs in iowa should be
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:58.600]  filing a suit today on the democratic party because microsoft announcing this prediction so called
[01:26:58.600 --> 01:27:04.200]  of who's gonna win the race in the democratic side that totally they should just disqualify
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:07.800]  themselves from doing whatever they're gonna do and some people say wait you predict trump's gonna
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:12.440]  win yeah i'm not running the software info wars isn't running the election you have the people
[01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:18.840]  running the election both sides telling us who's gonna win yes they have no business making any
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:22.840]  kind of prediction like that they should be totally neutral they should act neutral does
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:26.200]  microsoft not have business creatives neckly modified mosquitoes and releasing them and
[01:27:26.200 --> 01:27:30.120]  saying that he wants to reduce world population to zero or not being involved in all sorts of
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:34.120]  eugenics programs either right though richard but he does do it he is involved in weather weapons
[01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:38.920]  programs too absolutely well that's just like this uh virus is going around they suspect that
[01:27:38.920 --> 01:27:45.480]  that was from a gmo mosquito right so bill gates and his eugenics plan and sitting here in the
[01:27:45.480 --> 01:27:51.240]  middle of this you know inserting himself into this middle of iowa election is just heinous and
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:55.080]  of course you know who bill gates has been supporting he's been supporting hillary clinton
[01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:59.720]  he's one of the most claiming democrats there is but no one ever talks about his politics he's one
[01:27:59.720 --> 01:28:06.040]  of the biggest donors to anti-gun causes richard what a surprise what a surprise i mean so yes
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:10.200]  bill gates and microsoft made very well this could be the biggest black guy they ever get
[01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:16.040]  because i guarantee you what look bernie sanders the enthusiasm gap of his people if they see this
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:21.320]  happen they're get you know when a democratic caucus happens what's going to happen is those
[01:28:21.320 --> 01:28:26.360]  people show up let's say a hundred people show up physically at that caucus and let's say 45 or for
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:31.640]  hillary and 45 or for bernie and 10 or for martin o'Malley they each go to different parts of the
[01:28:31.640 --> 01:28:37.640]  room and if you don't have a 15 threshold then those 10 for martin o'malley have to go somewhere
[01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:42.360]  they either have to leave the building or they have to go into the bernie camp or the hillary camp
[01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:48.520]  to be counted now i figure that anybody that's behind martin o'malley that's a protest vote
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:55.000]  protesting the establishment protesting hillary that margin of error that martin o'malley faction
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:59.960]  whether it's three percent seven percent whatever it is that i think is what can put bernie sanders
[01:28:59.960 --> 01:29:06.040]  over the top over hillary and we do need that because uh he's a very unpopular uh communist
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:11.240]  is what he really is donald trump's right hillary's got a lot of political power still uh and so
[01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:17.400]  most experts think and i agree that bernie will be easier to beat uh than hillary oh absolutely i
[01:29:17.400 --> 01:29:22.120]  mean don trump being the nominee is just going to wipe the floor with bernie sanders and like i
[01:29:22.120 --> 01:29:27.640]  told you a lot of those bernie sanders folks they're actually awake about the big money the big
[01:29:27.640 --> 01:29:31.560]  banking the financial so yeah they just still don't get that the elite's not gonna give them a free
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:35.240]  lunch stay there richard i want to walk through the folks you've talked to what the sense is on the
[01:29:35.240 --> 01:29:40.920]  ground uh is trump gonna win it big will microsoft steal it from trump as well you know it's not just
[01:29:40.920 --> 01:29:52.760]  a democrat situation here stay with us from isla we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:30:01.560]  and the gcn radio network the islamic state is threatening to launch an attack on london so
[01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:06.200]  terrible that it will turn children's hair white the extremist group published an article in its
[01:30:06.200 --> 01:30:11.000]  arabic language newspaper stating a doomsday attack would take place on british soil isis
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:15.640]  claimed the uk would receive the lion's share of its european terrorist attacks threat is apparently
[01:30:15.640 --> 01:30:19.960]  in response to uk's decision to extend its aerial bombing campaign against the islamic state it also
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:24.520]  promises to carry out follow-up attacks through the paris massacre in november which left 130 dead
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:28.600]  and more than 300 injured the islamic state finally referenced a verse of the korean which
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:33.320]  discusses judgment day stating the attack on britain will be so horrific it will turn children's
[01:30:33.320 --> 01:30:36.920]  hair to white the threat will no doubt fuel concerns that jihadists are exploiting the
[01:30:36.920 --> 01:30:41.480]  refugee crisis to slip into e u undetected by using fake passports so they can launch terrorist
[01:30:41.480 --> 01:30:45.640]  attacks on british soil if there is a terrorist attack it's likely the uk government will exploit
[01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:49.240]  it to enact a police state just like france especially considering that nato has been
[01:30:49.240 --> 01:30:53.480]  arming and funding isis as a proxy army gets syria for quite some time you can read more

[01:37:06.440 --> 01:37:12.360]  to richard reeves richard you've got the floor now to go through what you've witnessed what
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:15.480]  has unfolded we're going to be back later carrying some of the live trump event
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:20.520]  in about an hour once it kicks off what else do you expect to come out what are you hearing on the
[01:37:20.520 --> 01:37:27.000]  ground there from iowa well alex you know i've been watching all the news programs like a hawk and
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.040]  we've talked to a ton of men on the street talked with campaign officials campaign staff talked to
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:38.840]  everybody and to finish up talking about this microsoft issue is the bernie sanders camp has
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:44.120]  super enthusiastic people that they're kind of like the ram paul people on the republican side as
[01:37:44.120 --> 01:37:50.440]  far as enthusiasm goes totally different mindset yes but enthusiasm levels kind of on the same par
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:57.080]  so guaranteed that these enthusiastic people for bernie sanders if they see foul by microsoft
[01:37:57.080 --> 01:38:00.120]  which they will they'll be able to deserve it because they're going to be at the front of
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:04.040]  their caucus they're going to be sitting there they're probably half of them are going to be
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:09.560]  officials of the caucus meeting of the caucus events so they're going to know exactly what
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:14.520]  the numbers are in their particular caucus so the state's going to have it all on the website at
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:19.480]  some point what the numbers were in each caucus what they broke down how many hillary caucus
[01:38:19.480 --> 01:38:26.440]  goers how many the problem is they say they're using this microsoft system to run it so that
[01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:32.440]  so it's the main feed now sanders and and trump and others have set up their own shadow systems
[01:38:32.440 --> 01:38:37.880]  to try to track this so that may keep microsoft honest but listen what is microsoft doing unvetted
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:43.640]  unapproved out of the blue and then saying they believe hillary's going to win right there as you
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:49.960]  said they have disqualified themselves on so many fronts this is a huge power grab by microsoft they
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:55.800]  are the new die bold absolutely they should recuse themselves immediately from what's going on
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:00.360]  and they should just go back to the you know the system that they had probably although
[01:39:00.360 --> 01:39:05.000]  that was problematic last time remember they didn't declare santorum the winner till like a week later
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:11.320]  at first they declared declared mit romney the winner in 2012 and that cost santorum valuable
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:17.080]  momentum of course it did so but that obviously that was a ploy as well so it's just typical
[01:39:17.080 --> 01:39:23.240]  new world order activity one ploy after the next and alex kind of shifting gears for a second you've
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:28.360]  got tons of fans and tons of listeners here in iowa and in case you're close to see your rabbits
[01:39:28.360 --> 01:39:32.040]  and you don't know about the donald trump event and you're listening to the live stream this
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:37.640]  donald trump is about to speak here in a little less than an hour at 130 here at the double tree
[01:39:37.640 --> 01:39:43.880]  hotel downtown cedar rapids iowa so come on down as you can see and mad if you want to pan there's
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:49.480]  probably already uh you know somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 people here and i'm guessing
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:53.720]  there's probably three or 400 people queued up waiting to go through the secret that's right
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:57.000]  they always turn back many more they can't get in the secret services going through everybody's
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:40:01.960]  stuff right now trump's right to talk what in about an hour and a half or how long he speaks at
[01:40:01.960 --> 01:40:07.640]  130 p.m central time so it's less than an hour that he'll be on this stage right here now we'll
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:12.120]  take part of that feed and earlier i was saying richard why aren't you closer to the front and
[01:40:12.120 --> 01:40:16.520]  then i realize you're in the press area already trump doesn't let the press get up at the front
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:21.160]  now because they keep saying nobody's there he's smart to make the cameras you know be back from
[01:40:21.160 --> 01:40:24.680]  there but uh you know they probably know that we're not going to be distorting that so maybe
[01:40:24.680 --> 01:40:27.720]  they'll let us up front but i don't i don't want to mess with it it's fine richard just wherever
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:32.760]  you need to be you're doing a great job well i think we're in a good place and uh you know we're
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:38.200]  talking about the microsoft let's follow up on that a little bit more because the g.o.p alex alex
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:44.760]  the g.o.p still has a delegate strategy and the reason i know that is because marco rubio's comments
[01:40:44.760 --> 01:40:49.960]  that he's you know in all of his talks he says i'm confident i'll have the delegates i'm confident
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:54.760]  i'll have the delegates you know it's like one of those prescan mind control hypnotic things you
[01:40:54.760 --> 01:40:59.800]  know i'm confident i have the delegates you know you will submit you will assimilate resistance
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:05.640]  is futile exactly so if he says it often enough and hard enough and vociferously enough and
[01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:11.160]  emotionally enough then he thinks it's going to come true but behind the scenes i guarantee alex
[01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:16.680]  there is a delegate strategy that the g.o.p still has the problem will be is if trump starts running
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:22.040]  the table starting here in iowa then i think that they can't fight a landslide notice they're not
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:27.720]  able to steal new hampshire from sanders because he has a 15 to 18 point lead in every poll notice
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:32.040]  where it's close though is where they come and turn the machines on because then they can confuse
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:36.120]  everybody and play hanky panky and i've interviewed bev harris probably 40 times all the other top
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:41.480]  experts who've proven election fraud and caught it over and over again we fought it here in austin
[01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:45.240]  had the state board admit we found fraud richard you and i they still threw it out and said we
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:49.240]  don't care we certify the election you know i mean we've had county commissioners fall down
[01:41:49.240 --> 01:41:53.560]  crying when they lose and their friend runs in and says i'll fix it honey and suddenly flips the
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:42:00.440]  votes and that was in the paper so just crazy how obvious these people get but that's true you're
[01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:05.000]  talking about landslide numbers it's like earlier you're reciting poll numbers where trump in some
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  cases is you know 40 50 percent when he wins iowa which i predict he will i think that'll give him
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:16.200]  a five or ten point jump in the rest of the state and i keep saying that he can't beat in the general
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:21.240]  election hillary he's already in most polls got double the poll numbers other republicans do with
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:27.240]  black voters uh with hispanic voters you name it but also a lot of blue collar working class
[01:42:27.240 --> 01:42:33.000]  democrats of every race color and creed they get socialism delivers crap overall they want the
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.400]  economy back they like somebody not running the country down talking about making better deals
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:42.600]  for our country which you look look look even a moron could fix the country the globalist have
[01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:49.240]  set it up to derail us and that's why bill berg is so scared because trump is the guy to destroy
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:54.840]  hillary clinton he's the strongest candidate across the board other than iran paul uh because a
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:43:00.280]  lot of democrats would go for him because he's anti-war uh the problem is uh that he's not really
[01:43:00.280 --> 01:43:04.840]  in the lead now he's not in the pack now he shoots around you know like speed racer and gets
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:08.520]  the head of the line all supporting but right now the only horse we got in this fight's donald
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:13.320]  trump and every bit of firepower they've got directed right at him only a moron you know would
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:19.080]  have to um not understand the fact that that trump is his anti-establishment whoever he may be
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:24.760]  that the establishment is scared of him for real if this isn't rhetoric this isn't some
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:28.760]  mackey of alien manipulation where they act like they don't like him but really they do
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:32.360]  because they'll do that on the surface but still give him money they are throwing everything they've
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:37.720]  got against him richard you watch television it's so obvious oh yes and alex you know you
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:42.200]  reminded me of a couple of key points that i've yet to relate to the info wars i just go over it
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:47.640]  the number one number one is the reason bernie sanders is in this ball game right now he can
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:53.080]  thank donald trump he can thank donald trump because in late december when hillary attacked
[01:43:53.080 --> 01:43:58.440]  donald trump about the sexist and misogynistic issue and trump just kind of launched a little
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:05.160]  shot across her bow about hillary's war on women and boom hillary shut up like that within one day
[01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:10.040]  it was like on new years and she's saying well i'll just let donald live in his alternate reality
[01:44:10.040 --> 01:44:15.480]  you know what that episode those two or three days right there at the end of 2015 going into new
[01:44:15.480 --> 01:44:20.520]  years day that's what put bernie sanders in this ball game it wasn't bernie sanders out there
[01:44:20.520 --> 01:44:26.200]  revving everybody up it was donald kicking hillary a little bit on this real war on women issue that
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:32.760]  she has and so thank you donald trump for taking hillary down to where bernie can beat her and
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:37.080]  you know people don't give him the credit for that but that's you know earlier we put up a video
[01:44:37.080 --> 01:44:42.600]  about trump exhibits power beyond presidential that's an example right there i mean the guide
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:47.320]  he talks about the iranian hostages he talks about he talks about it guess what yeah they're
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:51.080]  going to get released i could have called that before it happened sure let's expand on this i
[01:44:51.080 --> 01:44:55.160]  want to go over you say you run into a lot of info wars are on the ground what's the sense i mean
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:45:00.360]  how close is it between him and uh cruise from on the ground things that you're witnessing uh but
[01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:07.240]  first ran paul you know his dad was just on last week uh i thought he won the gop debate uh you know
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:11.960]  we like him you know we love ran paul but he's come out now and said trump's the worst choice again
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:17.960]  i guess to be a darling of the liberal media that's what's driven his numbers down we like
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:23.000]  hearing him about the drug war being a fraud these wars being a fraud the backing isis being bad
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:29.640]  we love hearing him talk about the nsa being out of control but but i mean rand i keep getting the
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:34.920]  message to him i've even told him on air uh a few weeks ago he was on i think it's a bad strategy
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:39.160]  to go after trump i mean hasn't he noticed that when cruise started attacking trump his numbers
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:45.880]  started sliding i know it's like ran paul had an opportunity to be number two in this race
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:51.480]  maybe even challenged don trump with the right approach and you know it's just a sad deal that
[01:45:51.480 --> 01:45:56.760]  ran paul has taken this tactic like you said of focusing more on don trump he's focused more on
[01:45:56.760 --> 01:46:03.400]  don trump than he's focused on obama more more than he's focused on hillary you know at ran paul
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:08.920]  in my opinion should have taken an alex jones tactic and hit the barb wire on so many issues on
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:15.160]  eugenics on gmo on vaccines he's had all these opp this last debate he should have been hitting
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:22.040]  the barb wire on 9 11 all these issues those were perfect opportunities that's right hit the barb wire
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:27.160]  on being screwed over with naftan gatt with open borders with deindustrialization with political
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:34.280]  correctness that's what ran needs to do is even almost red meat issues hit the barb wire he listened
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:38.600]  to the focus groups saying no if you don't let every illegal in your anti-hispanic well now
[01:46:38.600 --> 01:46:43.240]  it's more chinese we're not anti-chinese you can't just be open and have everything be free for the
[01:46:43.240 --> 01:46:48.280]  first wave that comes in we'll go bankrupt and and and so people look at it and go well the public
[01:46:48.280 --> 01:46:53.640]  once open borders 50 50 so i'll be forum partially we'll know you have to be a leader and explain why
[01:46:53.640 --> 01:46:59.000]  it's wrong to get people to follow you because it's the right thing to do that's where ran paul
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:03.480]  started to become a politician the people that loved him like myself was when he was saying the
[01:47:03.480 --> 01:47:09.400]  bold statements of we're backing isis it's wrong we're backing al qaeda they attacked him he exploded
[01:47:09.400 --> 01:47:15.080]  in the ratings became the frontrunner i mean this is not rocket science do the right thing
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:21.080]  be aggressive savage the system hit the barb wire attack the machine gun nest in the info war
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:24.520]  richard i want to play a clipper and then get your take on it here's donald trump saying he'll
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:29.800]  bring in new states into play uh new york normally goes democrat in the polls he's the son of new
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:35.240]  york they love him there that guy's gonna it's true i mean he's like no he won't and he'll bring in
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:40.280]  other swing states that's why he can destroy hillary clinton let's go to this clip i bring
[01:47:40.280 --> 01:47:44.520]  states into play that no republicans gonna think about for instance the concept of winning new york
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:50.360]  state is impossible for any of the people that i'm dealing with impossible it's not it's not even
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:54.280]  something they don't even campaign there i think we have a chance to win new york i mean they like
[01:47:54.280 --> 01:48:02.200]  me in new york they like me and by the way if we if we win new york you talk about a lot of you're
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:07.560]  talking about a lot of delegates right but if we win new york you're talking about a lot but we're
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:12.280]  going to win pennsylvania we're going to win virginia we're going to win michigan i'm always
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:17.080]  talking about the car business being stripped out of michigan and the poll numbers in michigan are
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:22.520]  incredible we're going to win ohio they did a poll i like john case it's very much but the problem
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:26.680]  is they did a poll in ohio and i'm beating him by a lot and he's the existing you know he's the
[01:48:26.680 --> 01:48:32.360]  serving governor we're going to win florida i'm at 48 percent against against 16 people that's right
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:37.320]  that's why the billard barbara scared i think a lot of states a lot of states that aren't even thought
[01:48:37.320 --> 01:48:41.720]  of you know if you listen right now because structurally the republicans have a disadvantage
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:45.640]  but you look at some of these states they don't even talk about those states that's right there's
[01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:51.400]  been a republican landslide that's good amount to basically six state levels uh at the local levels
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:57.960]  in congress i mean this is all prime they're talking about 80 plus percent of the of the
[01:48:57.960 --> 01:49:01.800]  counties in the country going republican this time i mean it's just it's just incredible
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:07.960]  stuff is happening right now and here's what i love i love how southern states are so pro
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:12.520]  trump when he is an incredible yankee and i mean that in an affectionate way because people
[01:49:12.520 --> 01:49:17.800]  always try to play the north and south off against each other trashy people who who are idiots don't
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:21.960]  like northerners in the south i i've never found anybody quite frankly that hates people from the
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:26.600]  north and and it's vice versa it's artificially made up by the media and the new york media making
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:30.520]  fun of the south and all the rest of it very hatefully with a lot of stereotypes and then
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:35.240]  crews tried to play that back against new york and it didn't work because the truth is america
[01:49:35.240 --> 01:49:40.600]  cares about each other no matter where we're from or what color we are it's time to understand
[01:49:40.600 --> 01:49:45.720]  we're being screwed over richard and i'm telling you trump will sweep to the presidency if he wins
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:53.240]  this nomination oh yes absolutely because he is the one g up guy that can win new york and that
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:58.280]  has come up here in the last three or four weeks that donald trump is in play in pennsylvania in
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:04.280]  new york and i'll tell you what no democrats gonna win the electoral college race in the general
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:08.360]  election when you've got a candidate that wins those states when they've you know when we've
[01:50:08.360 --> 01:50:12.600]  got all the red states that go behind richard you know we never get behind a candidate here
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:15.720]  when it's for you know president because it's such a circus and we don't want to make the
[01:50:15.720 --> 01:50:21.240]  president the only focus but uh i mean when did you switch and your gut to support let me make

[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:12.600]  30 years tracking an obscure threat to america today he says it's about to reach a sudden and
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:18.280]  disturbing conclusion if he's right your way of life is about to change very suddenly from where
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:23.400]  you shop to the doctors you visit to your retirement and the family you want to protect now he's made
[01:53:23.400 --> 01:53:29.080]  predictions like this before and he was right then too a few years ago he warned that housing prices
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:35.240]  would collapse they did before that he warned that dot com companies would crash they did those who
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:40.600]  listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing to do with the stock market this will
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:45.960]  affect us all a free video he's released online details everything you need to know at dollar
[01:53:45.960 --> 01:53:51.160]  downfall dot com now maybe you'll disagree with his conclusions but first you need to watch this
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:57.560]  video and see the facts for yourself just go to dollar downfall dot com that's dollar downfall dot com
[01:53:57.560 --> 01:54:11.160]  the establishment is really trying to take donald trump down and it's for real doesn't mean he won't
[01:54:11.160 --> 01:54:17.000]  betray us that may we put all our eggs in one basket but it's easy to sit back and be a commentator
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:23.400]  and never actually put your name on something i'm endorsing donald trump for president 2016
[01:54:23.400 --> 01:54:30.680]  all the way if rand paul goes on the lead i'll support him as well or ted cruise i got real
[01:54:30.680 --> 01:54:42.120]  questions about ted cruise um but at a gut level better than hillary a lot better um as for uh rand
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:48.440]  i know he's a great guy he just he's too nice of a guy i mean believe me the pauls are like
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:55.720]  goody two shoes to the max and it's just he they just won't get aggressive and i understand that
[01:54:55.720 --> 01:54:59.960]  that's fine we'll see who's right in the end trump has got him scared to death because he's a personality
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:05.880]  that wants to go up against him uh richard reeves uh we're going to go to break and come back a
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:09.720]  little joke piece about donald trump it's really funny in a minute and then and then obviously
[01:55:09.720 --> 01:55:13.720]  i've got other guests coming on uh on the nasa hack and more and then you're coming back with a live
[01:55:13.720 --> 01:55:18.280]  uh trump feed if he's actually giving a speech i'll go to it if he's just bringing his friends on
[01:55:18.280 --> 01:55:24.280]  stage i'm not going to cover that uh but obviously it's all about being a family i get it uh but uh
[01:55:24.280 --> 01:55:27.080]  other points you think are important to make here and what you're going to be reporting on
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:31.000]  well alex right before that last break we started talking about how the founding fathers
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:35.720]  were geniuses were geniuses and they set up our system of checks and balances right now
[01:55:36.280 --> 01:55:41.560]  the democrat establishment in the house and senate the republican establishment in the house
[01:55:41.560 --> 01:55:45.160]  and senate do not like trump so they're not going to cooperate with him right now
[01:55:48.280 --> 01:55:52.680]  that's right following up and making further reports on this but if trump has huge coattails
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:56.600]  well those coattails those coattails are going to be tea partiers are going to be patriots are
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:01.000]  going to be liberate liberty minded coattails so he's not going to be able to trample over them
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:06.840]  so you know he's going to have to work with that's right trump trump has said i'm not going to let
[01:56:06.840 --> 01:56:11.800]  you down to me personally uh and i mean he wouldn't invite me up to new york to have you know bring
[01:56:11.800 --> 01:56:16.520]  my son and meet him and stuff if i mean if he he doesn't act like an oral politician and i don't
[01:56:16.520 --> 01:56:20.440]  get the creepy feeling i mean because years ago i had clinton people call him go come work with
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:23.720]  the democrats you can come have dinner when the clinton's come to town and shell out this is like
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:29.080]  a 96 97 and then the bush people were like hey the governor actually had secret service come by the
[01:56:29.080 --> 01:56:32.600]  studio one time hey the governor why she was just watching tonight you guys ought to have dinner
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:37.400]  sometime i mean that really happened so paul and i never reached back when politicians did that
[01:56:37.400 --> 01:56:43.240]  because it was just creepy that's not the case with trump right alex he is kind of like king
[01:56:43.240 --> 01:56:48.200]  mightest that everything he touches turns to gold look at thursday last week all right he
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:53.800]  lifted fox's boat even though he went and did another event that still lifted fox's boat
[01:56:53.800 --> 01:57:01.240]  he lifted meghan kelly's boat absolutely richard i see reporters i i see two female
[01:57:01.240 --> 01:57:05.400]  reporters setting up behind you that's kind of what reporters do so make sure they don't
[01:57:05.400 --> 01:57:09.640]  hawk you know hog the trough and steal your shot of trump i mean it's not that we don't
[01:57:09.640 --> 01:57:13.800]  mind looking at the nice young ladies uh the reporters i mean maybe that's better to have
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:19.560]  them on screen but the point is is that they are kind of uh hogging in there so we've got it we've
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:26.120]  got it we've got it all set up internet will be live streaming good well i can't help but

[01:57:44.520 --> 01:57:48.760]  all right his skype's gone as more people enter the place he's got backup feeds but he does
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:55.000]  just he lifts other people as well like i said even making kelly all right you know he's kind
[01:57:55.000 --> 01:57:59.240]  of banger around a little bit verbally whatever but she's got her stock has gone up you know even

[02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:34.200]  i know we've got two links up on drudge and then that that third one makes a trifecta but
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:39.880]  where's the where's the other one you told me it was there on the uh on the part with microsoft
[02:02:39.880 --> 02:02:45.240]  where is that in the middle column or is the left column oh it's the very top okay okay so the other
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:51.720]  links down there again it's teleprompter free uh news here microsoft calls for hillary before
[02:02:51.720 --> 02:02:56.920]  count vote imagine how much that upsets the globalist that we're actually discussing this and
[02:02:56.920 --> 02:03:02.600]  actually looking at this and actually uh going over this this this must absolutely nauseate them
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:07.800]  okay i mentioned the comedy piece we're not making fun of trump but he makes fun of himself you know
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:12.040]  that he's orange and i make fun of myself and call myself pumpkin head we both have big heads
[02:03:12.040 --> 02:03:16.440]  uh so when i make fun of people in a friendly way it's just that it's friendly but i saw
[02:03:16.440 --> 02:03:22.440]  all this piece on one of the democrat party websites watched this british actor hilariously
[02:03:22.440 --> 02:03:29.560]  turned donald trump into a cottony tough guy uh and it's because his cadence is almost like
[02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:34.280]  a cottony cadence but a different inflection so from a linguist perspective it's it's it's
[02:03:34.280 --> 02:03:39.240]  very very interesting uh let's go ahead and go to this piece i think i'll win the hispanics
[02:03:39.240 --> 02:03:43.880]  i play thousands of hispanics they love me i love them and i think i'm gonna do great with women
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:47.720]  and one of the reasons i'm gonna do great with women is that that's not it i'm not like hillary
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:52.440]  clinton she's got no you don't kill it she's got yeah that's not it i sent it over sunday it's it's
[02:03:52.440 --> 02:03:56.440]  and that's not a copy there are two videos in the article this is the second video here it is let's
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:04:01.880]  go ahead and play it it's sort of interesting she said i watched her last night donald trump
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:06.760]  looks like she practices in front of a mirror for two hours donald trump said i think he's dangerous
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:13.560]  i'm dangerous she's the one that caused all this problem with her stupid policies you look at what
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:19.240]  she did with libya what she did with syria well that's an elitist pompous british accent that's not
[02:04:19.240 --> 02:04:24.840]  a cockney hey but it did matter that's fun too what i promise is i'm gonna find it and gonna play it
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:28.600]  out because i just say get me the trommel trump cockney accent and they got i guess there's another
[02:04:28.600 --> 02:04:35.080]  one but i'm gonna get it for you and we're gonna play it uh coming up because it's fine uh hearing
[02:04:35.080 --> 02:04:42.680]  on elitist fop a dandy accent is not fun of course i can speak as the brutus family actually
[02:04:42.680 --> 02:04:49.560]  does from pennsylvania the royalty these people have too much energy they're carbon footprint now
[02:04:49.560 --> 02:05:00.280]  summon the royal train and the royal jumbo jams microsoft's bing technology has already called
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:05.000]  iowa victory for hillary clinton it result has not gone unnoticed among bernie sanders supporters
[02:05:05.000 --> 02:05:09.720]  given that an app created by microsoft will help tally the vote during tonight's caucus using data
[02:05:09.720 --> 02:05:14.280]  from polls prediction markets and anonymized and aggregated search engine queries to predict its
[02:05:14.280 --> 02:05:18.920]  results microsoft believes hillary will win three out of the first four democratic primaries taking
[02:05:18.920 --> 02:05:23.640]  iowa south carolina and nevada while sanders takes new hampshire and is noted by paul joseph
[02:05:23.640 --> 02:05:29.000]  watson microsoft also correctly predicted the outcome of the 2015 academy awards the no vote
[02:05:29.000 --> 02:05:34.680]  for scotch independence and the outcome for over 95 of the 2014 us midterm elections and that track
[02:05:34.680 --> 02:05:38.840]  record is raising concerns among bernie sanders supporters who have pointed out potential conflict
[02:05:38.840 --> 02:05:42.680]  of interest given that precinct officials are using the app created by microsoft to count
[02:05:42.680 --> 02:05:47.480]  votes and report caucus results last week sanders iowa campaign manager questioned the impartiality

[02:08:55.160 --> 02:09:04.840]  justice and freedom are more than words they are perspectives i would remind you that extremism

[02:09:24.200 --> 02:09:29.160]  i forgot about this intro it's great i forgot who made it such a wonderful crew they're also
[02:09:29.160 --> 02:09:35.240]  creative not just intelligent informed i mean i can't decide who's better at graphics uh whether
[02:09:35.240 --> 02:09:41.080]  it would be like darin mcbreen or jacari jackson or rob jacob center because they're all good at
[02:09:41.080 --> 02:09:47.400]  different things and just really just do a wonderful job and a bunch of other folks do that around
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:51.400]  here as well buckley does it everybody i mean there's just such an amazing crew here in infall
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:56.600]  wars i wasn't planning to come in and say how great they are it's just that the laziness of other radio
[02:09:56.600 --> 02:10:02.280]  shows the laziness of other tv shows i tuned into fox or cnn and all they do is talk about the emails
[02:10:02.280 --> 02:10:09.400]  all day never pointing out all our other crimes but i guess at least they're talking about the
[02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:14.680]  fact that the email scandal is going on but man i'll be working out for like an hour in the
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:20.360]  morning with fox news on the background it's like uh if they just talk to you like you're five years old
[02:10:20.360 --> 02:10:25.320]  and donald trump's not viable only getting 45 percent of the vote against other republicans
[02:10:25.320 --> 02:10:30.280]  and states whenever there's been five six seven candidates nobody's got that normally they'd say
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:35.080]  oh that shows he's the leader if it was a bush or somebody but because it's not they go oh that shows
[02:10:35.080 --> 02:10:39.160]  that's what he'll get of the conservatives period they're going to vote for democrats instead of
[02:10:39.160 --> 02:10:44.440]  donald trump lying to their viewers and i'm telling you fox news is out to get donald trump
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:50.280]  is out to get donald trump and that's all i needed to know because fox news at the top
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:58.120]  run by rupert murdoch is a democratic party filth nest basically and that's how they control
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:03.000]  everybody oh i know roger ailes is probably conservative and you know helps set up limbo
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:07.240]  and all that but if you look at all the rest of fox's programming i mean it is just a
[02:11:07.240 --> 02:11:15.800]  a basket of anti-family anti-gun anti-liberty garbage and i'm not signaling on fox there's
[02:11:15.800 --> 02:11:20.200]  even more stuff on viacom you know at least fox isn't promoting pedophilia and you know
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:26.600]  sexualization of children uh like viacom is in my opinion but it is crazy okay uh richard reeves
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:33.560]  will be popping back in with a live feed as trump takes the stage uh if trump starts you know just
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:39.160]  just bringing people up on stage another to say and we're going to tune out of it obviously
[02:11:40.680 --> 02:11:45.160]  and that's a tactic to include the people i get it and the general public sees him bringing people
[02:11:45.160 --> 02:11:49.400]  up on stage and doing it i that's one of trump's gimmicks i don't like because if i bring somebody
[02:11:49.400 --> 02:11:52.920]  up on stage they got something to say it's not like just like the state of the union where obama
[02:11:52.920 --> 02:11:57.160]  knows the certain points of this guy and points that that guy ought to associate with each group
[02:11:57.160 --> 02:12:02.440]  like you got your attention now you got your attention now this group gets their attention
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:07.880]  how about just get out of my life government that's the kind of attention i want i want to
[02:12:07.880 --> 02:12:12.920]  be left alone i mean i i'd rather live out on a farm or a ranch far far away from a city
[02:12:13.640 --> 02:12:19.000]  and just only have to be around people i want to associate with uh but unfortunately there's
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:23.320]  something called globalist run government that is not getting out of my life and is not leaving me
[02:12:23.320 --> 02:12:29.080]  alone so we did find the particular cockney accent video uh that i was wanting to play
[02:12:29.080 --> 02:12:35.080]  of donald trump which is really hilarious uh where he talks about it is donald trump's words
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:41.560]  it's just they put a voice over over it uh so this is what trump did say about sanders in hillary
[02:12:41.560 --> 02:12:48.120]  and it is true so here it is look i was the best thing that ever happened to bernie salters because
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:52.760]  my attack on hillary all of a sudden she went out and salters got all acquainted for me
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:58.920]  you're the credit here this guy i mean you know this guy bernie salters give me a break that
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:13:04.120]  does he figure it all this but he got all the credit i love because i'm unbelievable i have to
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:10.280]  say that once i assume the prices isn't anything and i had to it up because she said full swing is
[02:13:10.280 --> 02:13:14.840]  about me so i had to ride but i haven't even focused you know on a fox poll and another poll
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:19.000]  that just came out that i'm beating hillary but i'm beating hillary i'm beating hillary i haven't
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:23.960]  even i'm beating hillary i'm beating
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:29.880]  oh we haven't even focused on in the ring we haven't even focused here's a guy he's uh well
[02:13:29.880 --> 02:13:34.760]  they say socialist but some people would say he's a communist okay communist okay but i shouldn't
[02:13:34.760 --> 02:13:38.280]  hit him too hard though because if i hit him hard he'll go down and end up being more of a
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:42.600]  man i love hillary maybe we want him to fight for a while so i'll say isn't he a wonderful guy
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:46.280]  wonderful i want to find out who did that voice on us it's interesting i was thinking
[02:13:46.280 --> 02:13:50.920]  i never thought for us when i hear hillary last week and bill but i did the right thing
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:54.600]  all of a sudden they did this and then they stood up and they did this
[02:13:54.600 --> 02:14:01.000]  bernie saunders is surging an amazing thing up over i did it i'm saying i did that i did the
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:06.200]  name now maybe i should hit or i could hit him i like drump let's just say i love drump could
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:12.360]  hit him and then i really love the accent i'm fascinated i watch this with my kids like three
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:17.960]  times as we go they love it too they all love trump my kids love trump before i like trump
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:21.720]  like they're the ones that made me six seven months ago start paying attention to him
[02:14:22.440 --> 02:14:25.960]  because you know i have so many other serious issues to deal with the election hadn't heated
[02:14:25.960 --> 02:14:31.640]  up yet i'm like the guy on celebrity apprentice the guy that owns the hotels and stuff okay uh
[02:14:31.640 --> 02:14:43.000]  the the democrat and then i began to research him and uh i'm gonna say this and i mean it
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:48.760]  if donald trump gets elected president and he starts screwing over the liberty movement
[02:14:48.760 --> 02:14:53.800]  we are going to get him impeached and it'll be easier than you think people are gonna hate him
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:59.640]  so much if he betrays us and that doesn't mean he doesn't have to be perfect he can play politics
[02:14:59.640 --> 02:15:03.640]  whatever to get some deals done but he better move us back in the direction of free market back
[02:15:03.640 --> 02:15:08.600]  in the direction of freedom you know he gives us five freedoms back or helps us get those freedoms
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:13.080]  back or fights for those and then you know does one bad thing i'm not going to go after
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:18.280]  but if he doesn't move that needle far back towards liberty or die trying politically i am going to
[02:15:18.280 --> 02:15:23.800]  go completely ape and i know a lot of other people are as well in fact that's a big question we
[02:15:23.800 --> 02:15:29.960]  ought to open the phones up what are you going to do a of hillary gets in and and she is going to
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:34.840]  move against the people how are you going to feel if you didn't back trump and that happened
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:40.280]  and ted cruz is really slick he's really smart he's got some problems though
[02:15:40.920 --> 02:15:45.400]  and the system would rather have him in there than trump what does that tell you and i'm not
[02:15:45.400 --> 02:15:51.160]  against ted cruz but i'm not taking phones right now uh paul watson's actually hosting i don't know
[02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:54.200]  why i said anthony i guess i was talking to anthony about coming on and covering some health news or
[02:15:54.200 --> 02:15:58.440]  something but paul watson's coming up in about 45 minutes from now he'll obviously be covering all
[02:15:58.440 --> 02:16:03.720]  of this you know steve watson his brother is real smart um and who's worked with us for 13 years paul
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:07.880]  for almost 15 uh he's got a political science degree you know been involved in a lot of stuff
[02:16:07.880 --> 02:16:14.680]  over in england he's a smart cookie and he likes ran paul and then paul more and more likes trumpas
[02:16:14.680 --> 02:16:21.800]  um as you can see because again this is how the world works from from my perspective trump has
[02:16:21.800 --> 02:16:30.040]  become the office or the figurehead for populism not just conservatism or libertarianism and is a
[02:16:30.040 --> 02:16:35.880]  symbol of the revolt now and so it doesn't matter what that horse does down the road really if he
[02:16:35.880 --> 02:16:41.080]  screws us over or goes sideways or you know something the work's already done destroying
[02:16:41.080 --> 02:16:47.000]  mainstream media super charging grassroots taking debates away from the government-run media teaching
[02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:52.840]  folks we can do our own events our own spectacles showing people that we're not dead in the game
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:59.880]  the globalists have always just acted like i am the powerful mighty Oz and i am unstoppable you are
[02:16:59.880 --> 02:17:09.000]  mere rat droppings i've been politically involved for 25 24 years on air for 21 next month
[02:17:09.000 --> 02:17:17.880]  a month and a half and all i know is 90 percent of the time you take the field you will win against
[02:17:17.880 --> 02:17:23.160]  corrupt people and bad people because folks are just looking for something else and when you get
[02:17:23.160 --> 02:17:27.720]  attacked you think you're getting hurt and then you're only becoming more powerful and people
[02:17:27.720 --> 02:17:30.520]  get attacked couple times like oh my gosh the newspaper attacked me people say people come
[02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:35.160]  over and go man i saw you were in the local paper and some local hosts were attacking you how you
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:40.360]  handling it bud friends and family over the years and i go i didn't read the local paper i didn't
[02:17:40.360 --> 02:17:45.080]  listen to local radio i was in a thousand other papers attacking me this week you think i care
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:51.880]  you know where they they they have talk show hosts it's all because they're jealous and pathetic and
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:57.240]  scared of the system and want to grovel to it so the all these local hosts just make stuff up about
[02:17:57.240 --> 02:18:01.720]  me and lie about me and they'll i one time i was in a restaurant some of these hosts walked over
[02:18:01.720 --> 02:18:07.400]  or i just swam like two miles i'd take him a day off and i was in a steakhouse at the at the bar
[02:18:08.040 --> 02:18:13.080]  a drink in her glass of red wine eating a tea bomb at like three o'clock in the afternoon about to go
[02:18:13.080 --> 02:18:17.480]  you know uh back to the office take a part of the day off and one of these hosts waddled over
[02:18:17.480 --> 02:18:23.000]  with his wife and began like going oh man it must be horrible to be so unlike to be so but
[02:18:23.000 --> 02:18:27.640]  and he was mind controlling like i would grovel like i was in third grade and because the cool
[02:18:27.640 --> 02:18:33.640]  kid come over and pee pee on myself and then like and like go cry and slip my wrist at night and i just
[02:18:33.640 --> 02:18:41.000]  sat there and just smiled at the guy it was hilarious i mean but i understand like on the
[02:18:41.000 --> 02:18:48.440]  general public i guess that stuff works you could have five billion people and i could be my clothes
[02:18:48.440 --> 02:18:54.920]  ripped off naked in the middle of a sports stadium with them throwing tomatoes at me and telling me
[02:18:54.920 --> 02:18:59.560]  i was the trash of the earth and if i hadn't done anything wrong i'd stand there naked proud of who
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:07.240]  i am but i realized that's leadership and the average person has had it bred out of them or
[02:19:07.240 --> 02:19:14.760]  something they're so scared they're so scared of everything and and i'm here to tell you folks
[02:19:14.760 --> 02:19:19.720]  sheep will be ruled sheep will be torn apart by wolves stop acting like sheep
[02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:27.960]  stop acting like sheep it's the old sheep dog analogy and every time i do it now people think
[02:19:27.960 --> 02:19:33.640]  i'm talking about american sniper no that's that's an old military saying and i guess it's from all
[02:19:33.640 --> 02:19:37.080]  over the south and all over everywhere because i grew up here and that my whole life from both
[02:19:37.080 --> 02:19:41.880]  grandfathers you name it we're not wolves we don't go out and abuse or hurt people we're not sheep
[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:48.040]  and when wolves mess with us we go for their neck and we're more powerful and quite frankly we're
[02:19:48.040 --> 02:19:53.080]  more evil than they are but we have our hearts pointed at god so our souls are good but when it
[02:19:53.080 --> 02:19:59.720]  comes to evil you servants of evil have no idea you don't even get the full picture survivalist

[02:24:19.640 --> 02:24:25.320]  hampshire other key battleground states new york florida he's doing a great job with our camera

[02:24:31.880 --> 02:24:37.640]  credentialed for the rnc i can't stand being with the dnc i mean i'm not saying i'm biased
[02:24:37.640 --> 02:24:42.200]  towards the republicans but i but i am i mean i can't be around a bunch of communists and socialists
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:47.880]  and scum i mean i've gone i've covered it they attack me they they call in police reports on me
[02:24:47.880 --> 02:24:53.160]  they harass me that's a new thing i haven't talked about yet on air is even in in austin
[02:24:54.520 --> 02:24:59.480]  where i've been since high school where my mother's from democrats now see me and they
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:04.840]  call fake police reports and the police department's aware of it they were the ones that told me
[02:25:04.840 --> 02:25:09.240]  about it and and if they're doing these dirty tricks here to me believe me they're doing it
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:19.080]  everywhere this scum is taking the gloves off that's all i'm saying and they it's a snitch
[02:25:19.080 --> 02:25:24.120]  society like the soviet union i'll say it again thank god the police are aware of it it's just
[02:25:25.000 --> 02:25:30.520]  these people really are trash i just cannot impart to you and and when i said a sheepdog
[02:25:30.520 --> 02:25:37.800]  is more evil than a wolf he has a wolf's nature but a heart to protect the sheep he loves the sheep
[02:25:37.800 --> 02:25:42.840]  he licks him he beds down with him he'll he'll die a sheepdog will take on three four wolves and
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:48.760]  will one sheepdog normally you know the proper breed can take out a wolf i mean they beat a wolf
[02:25:48.760 --> 02:25:52.680]  in a fight but sometimes there'll be a couple of wolves only one sheepdog and it'll it'll get killed
[02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:55.000]  you know fighting while it protects the sheep
[02:25:55.000 --> 02:26:01.640]  so it knows the tricks of the wolf it knows the wolf better than the wolf
[02:26:02.840 --> 02:26:06.760]  that's why i just look at these wolves and i see them and all the things they do
[02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:14.520]  and i know them but i'm not a wolf i'm a sheepdog and i see the public they don't have to be
[02:26:14.520 --> 02:26:19.560]  sheep either but the biggest problem we face is domestication we have been brought out of the
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:26.440]  environment brought out of the hardship adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters
[02:26:26.440 --> 02:26:32.040]  victory you know probably my favorite quote it's true and it's not that adversity is good
[02:26:32.600 --> 02:26:38.440]  but that old is an army or marine corps shirt pain is weakness leaving the body i mean that's
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:43.800]  really true and we spoil our kids we don't want to make them do chores we don't want to make them
[02:26:43.800 --> 02:26:47.240]  work hard on homework we we don't want to let them screw around and watch tv and then we end up getting
[02:26:47.240 --> 02:26:55.160]  spoiled rats that's the same thing culturally we've had it's so good that we now have gotten con to
[02:26:55.160 --> 02:27:03.240]  the point that somebody like bernie sanders can sit up there with classic class warfare
[02:27:04.440 --> 02:27:09.000]  and point out goldman sacks and jp morgan and walmart that have all worked closely with the
[02:27:09.000 --> 02:27:12.920]  democrat republican parties to have select crony operations
[02:27:12.920 --> 02:27:20.440]  with the federal reserve and with trade with china to set up artificial systems
[02:27:22.680 --> 02:27:27.240]  and then they point at free market and blame that when bernie sanders and all them know how
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:32.600]  the cow ate the cabbage and they know that's the globalist corporate robber baron takeover system
[02:27:32.600 --> 02:27:40.120]  of our golden goose and that weasel these weasels have the nerve to sit there with blood matted on
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:46.360]  them from all the chickens they've been killing in the henhouse pointing at us the guard dog saying
[02:27:46.360 --> 02:27:52.440]  we are who ate the chickens no the patriots didn't eat the chickens the free market didn't eat the
[02:27:52.440 --> 02:27:59.720]  chickens the free market built the chicken coop the free market built the farm the free market
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:04.280]  made it prosperous and the weasels and the wolves and all the rest of them came in here
[02:28:04.280 --> 02:28:12.040]  i mean if you can't look at hillary and know she's a wolf a stinking degenerate piece of trash
[02:28:12.840 --> 02:28:17.160]  an arch criminal on so many fronts then this country deserves to fall but here's the problem
[02:28:18.440 --> 02:28:24.360]  i have a sick thought where i go you know what forget folks they want to be slaves they want to be
[02:28:24.360 --> 02:28:29.560]  dumb half the public are a bunch of idiots like mit romney basically said properly just let them go
[02:28:29.560 --> 02:28:33.160]  let the country fall that'll teach them but there's so many good people in the country
[02:28:33.160 --> 02:28:38.520]  of every race, color, and creed who don't deserve it and that's why god said with sodomy and gamora
[02:28:38.520 --> 02:28:44.680]  if you can find 10 good families i'll spare the city couldn't do that you can find five good families
[02:28:44.680 --> 02:28:51.320]  you know two good families one good family couldn't do it but there are a lot of good families in
[02:28:51.320 --> 02:28:55.640]  this country we're going to go to bright come back with the trump event a bunch of other science
[02:28:55.640 --> 02:28:59.480]  technology economic news news blitz coming up i haven't gotten to stay with us take a lot of
[02:28:59.480 --> 02:29:04.280]  calls tomorrow by the way also a lot of big guests come up this week briefly we have a big
[02:29:04.280 --> 02:29:13.000]  special on one of our most popular products is 1995 normally it's 1695 uh the same bottle of
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:19.160]  the same dose of melatonin cost the same price on average at the store same quality we have l
[02:29:19.160 --> 02:29:23.320]  trip to fan melatonin valerian root and a whole bunch of other stuff so you're basically getting
[02:29:23.320 --> 02:29:28.680]  the equivalent of what is it 10 different ingredients 10 different bottles all in one big pill and
[02:29:28.680 --> 02:29:34.280]  this will knock you out good restful sleep not the camera you run off the road just naturally you
[02:29:34.280 --> 02:29:38.600]  want to go to sleep and i take two up sometimes usually i take one and you want nine ten hours
[02:29:38.600 --> 02:29:45.960]  that's what it gives me 15 off 24 hours only info wars life dot com we also have the sheepdog
[02:29:45.960 --> 02:29:53.720]  cups that are in with a sheepdog chasing a wolf the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio
[02:29:53.720 --> 02:30:02.120]  network the islamic state is threatening to launch an attack on london so terrible that
[02:30:02.120 --> 02:30:06.920]  it will turn children's hair white the extremist group published an article in its arabic language
[02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:11.960]  newspaper stating a doomsday attack would take place on british soil isis claimed the uk would
[02:30:11.960 --> 02:30:16.440]  receive the lion's share of its european terrorist attacks threat is apparently in response to uk's

[02:33:36.600 --> 02:33:45.560]  that we are looking at jp morgan slash's outlook for stocks citing feds diverging pressures but
[02:33:45.560 --> 02:33:49.480]  then you look at the other news the government says the economy is getting better it's wonderful
[02:33:49.480 --> 02:33:55.080]  but then of the imf the world bank the xm bank the international bank of settlements the debauch
[02:33:55.080 --> 02:34:00.840]  group the royal bank of scotland george soros they all say run for the hills i don't know when
[02:34:00.840 --> 02:34:07.080]  this is going to implode megabig but it's already imploding in a serious way
[02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:13.240]  and let's get one thing straight even though this is all artificial i'm not here cheerleading for
[02:34:13.240 --> 02:34:20.280]  some collapse so i consider and say i told you so i'm sitting here just wondering what's going
[02:34:20.280 --> 02:34:23.960]  to happen when this stuff goes belly up and the yuppies are out in the streets and don't know
[02:34:23.960 --> 02:34:28.920]  how to grow tomatoes just and i've studied the great depression in depth seven million people
[02:34:28.920 --> 02:34:35.800]  majoring university studies say died of malnutrition or associations of starvation over that decade
[02:34:35.800 --> 02:34:41.400]  and people most people knew how to skin a buck and run a trot line back then i don't care where i
[02:34:41.400 --> 02:34:46.840]  mean now i am a blithering idiot compared to the average person in 1929 when it comes to
[02:34:48.360 --> 02:34:55.320]  roofing my house unclogging a drain uh i mean i could skin a buck but i don't do the best job
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:35:00.040]  and chop it up absolutely perfectly in 30 minutes like my dad can do or his brother i mean it's like
[02:35:00.040 --> 02:35:10.040]  watching a machine um i can i've i've skinned a 400 pound wall hog and it's disgusting the
[02:35:10.040 --> 02:35:14.920]  ticks are all over and it stinks and the meat's pretty good you smoke it but you know i just
[02:35:14.920 --> 02:35:19.640]  haven't done it a hundred times like my dad he's like a machine doesn't mind it just does it you
[02:35:19.640 --> 02:35:25.880]  know me it's like i gotta do it can you but but i'm like a caveman compared to the average person so
[02:35:25.880 --> 02:35:30.280]  i'm a caveman and i'm a complete wimp compared to the outdoorsman that my ancestors were
[02:35:31.880 --> 02:35:37.480]  and then i just can't imagine what's gonna happen i mean it is going to be spectacular
[02:35:38.120 --> 02:35:41.400]  you look at grief you look at other areas where things have been collapsing i mean it's
[02:35:41.400 --> 02:35:46.040]  hellish and the media just kind of keeps the compartmentalized so i don't know i'm not trying
[02:35:46.040 --> 02:35:50.520]  to fear monger here i'm saying globalism is building something financial that will come down
[02:35:50.520 --> 02:35:58.600]  and it will come down a big way jp morgan slash's outlook for stocks citing feds diverging pressures
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:04.280]  is growth for us equities and serious jeopardy thanks to the fellow reserves interest rates
[02:36:04.280 --> 02:36:09.640]  question mark jp morgan chase says yes among wall street's largest banks the firm now has the most
[02:36:09.640 --> 02:36:15.880]  barest position for the s and p 500 index having previously ended 2015 with an s and p price target
[02:36:15.880 --> 02:36:21.320]  of 2200 morgan recently cut the number to 2000 citing poor earnings then it goes on from there
[02:36:21.320 --> 02:36:25.720]  uh there's layoffs just everywhere in austin this is the boom town usa the biggest boom
[02:36:25.720 --> 02:36:33.480]  town in america other than atlanta is right here atlanta georgia and guys don't have a
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:37.720]  heart attack if a skype doesn't work and we can't carry the trump just tell him shoot hd of it and
[02:36:37.720 --> 02:36:42.200]  put it out after because i know you get thousands of people in there and all the bandwidth gets sucked
[02:36:42.200 --> 02:36:47.800]  up not a bit i predicted it because as more people came in his quality got worse and worse it was
[02:36:47.800 --> 02:36:52.840]  like crystal clear and over 30 minutes it faded down to like you know just tell him shoot hd and
[02:36:52.840 --> 02:36:57.160]  relax my crew's so good they have like heart attacks if they something doesn't work it's not in
[02:36:57.160 --> 02:37:01.240]  their hands and the and the trump people let us jack in their audio feed and everything they're
[02:37:01.240 --> 02:37:05.240]  very nice but it's it's fine just shoot hd and then put the whole thing out richard just tell
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:11.160]  richard that just abort that it's not a big deal it's not a baby okay uh the fed is freaking out
[02:37:11.160 --> 02:37:14.680]  about financial markets and then it goes in the federal reserve saying they're really worried
[02:37:14.680 --> 02:37:20.520]  about stuff collapsing uh why 2016 keeps getting uglier for the u.s economy another article uh
[02:37:20.520 --> 02:37:27.720]  Puerto Rico proposes debt cut for creditors slammed by insurer so now they want to pay
[02:37:28.760 --> 02:37:33.720]  their creditors less money which if you look at all the interest they're paying it is unreasonable
[02:37:33.720 --> 02:37:38.920]  they should you know get that cut but a deal's a deal and you signed up to screw the people of
[02:37:38.920 --> 02:37:46.680]  Puerto Rico people say oh that's Puerto Rico 51st banana republic it's easy to shake your finger
[02:37:47.320 --> 02:37:51.320]  at areas that have been more impoverished than us that never got out of colonialism basically
[02:37:51.880 --> 02:37:59.960]  when we go belly up or you know what up memory gland up is going to be worse than that because
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:04.040]  it at least in Puerto Rico they've been poor for a long time and they do have gardens outside
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:08.760]  their houses and chickens and know how to go catch fish even if the game warden tells them they can
[02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:15.800]  that's another thing in the great depression even though my family was upper middle class
[02:38:16.520 --> 02:38:19.960]  almost all the deer and everything were killed even the possums that armadillos because
[02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:23.960]  everybody was eating them or they'd starve to death in east texas what's going to happen to the
[02:38:23.960 --> 02:38:27.000]  game wardens when everything collapses now and they're running around trying to keep folks from
[02:38:27.000 --> 02:38:30.600]  hunting to live well you know what's going to happen to them and i don't want game wards to get
[02:38:30.600 --> 02:38:35.960]  hurt but once people start starving and the feds want to run around all wild eyed it's easy to
[02:38:35.960 --> 02:38:42.360]  intimidate some you know 200 pounds 250 pound guy in his truck point a gun at him you point guns at
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:47.720]  people that hadn't had a meal in two or three days they want to kill you and they're not going to
[02:38:47.720 --> 02:38:52.920]  wait for you to shoot first once stuff unravels i mean i look at the feds and some of the local
[02:38:52.920 --> 02:38:57.080]  departments that think they're gi joe and they're actually getting off on the southern property
[02:38:57.080 --> 02:39:01.480]  law center and adl propaganda who say they want to have a shooting war with the patriots
[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:08.040]  that's like saying you want to jump into a pit of rattlesnakes
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:16.360]  yeah you got a machete you may kill 100 of them before they bite you 14 times and you die there's
[02:39:16.360 --> 02:39:25.240]  no point it's dumb but they train people you know it's like the popular culture under summer redstone
[02:39:25.240 --> 02:39:30.120]  and via common mtv for 25 years they they said we're going to pick the punk culture with the
[02:39:30.120 --> 02:39:33.640]  jeans hanging down in prison that means that you're a punk and a nobody and then you know you're
[02:39:33.640 --> 02:39:39.240]  used as a sex toy but so all the young people still let that fad never goes out black white
[02:39:39.240 --> 02:39:42.520]  Hispanic you know they have their pants hanging down and that when the cops see that that means
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:49.080]  you're a drug dealer and an ex-con so you're wearing a uniform that says slam me up against a wall
[02:39:49.080 --> 02:39:52.680]  get in my face shake me down because of reasonable suspicion
[02:39:57.160 --> 02:40:00.040]  you see how that works and i'm not saying you can't have your pants hanging down around your
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:07.080]  legs okay you can have whatever style you want i don't care i wear a sports jacket and wear a
[02:40:07.080 --> 02:40:12.520]  uh you know a stainless steel watch and and have short hair because it's easy to comb short hair
[02:40:12.520 --> 02:40:19.240]  and this is how you dress to get left alone dumbo you know drive a forward expedition
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:23.400]  wear a sports jacket with a white shirt with silver cuff links and get ready for body to get
[02:40:23.400 --> 02:40:29.080]  out of your way but but people don't listen i mean imagine these guys that drive a Ferrari
[02:40:29.080 --> 02:40:33.640]  want to be messed with or robbed or pulled over you know you want to be messed with go
[02:40:33.640 --> 02:40:38.200]  ahead and get messed with all day everything in nature is about colorations like this butterfly
[02:40:38.200 --> 02:40:42.520]  looks this way this snake head looks this way warning you letting you know telling you they
[02:40:42.520 --> 02:40:48.280]  train you to dress up in criminal outfits might as well wear a little mask on your head or maybe
[02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:52.440]  have stockings over your face and then wonder why you get messed with in the system
[02:40:55.800 --> 02:41:02.040]  conversely they're training the police that this is the world and you're gonna have a coming battle
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:07.400]  with the gun owners and veterans that's like the adl or seven poverty law center coming down to your
[02:41:07.400 --> 02:41:14.120]  police department with a wood chipper i might do this as a stunt actually and go down to the police
[02:41:14.120 --> 02:41:19.160]  department and like feed dummies and police uniforms into a wood chipper saying please don't
[02:41:19.160 --> 02:41:24.520]  let them start a civil war with the patriots because i'm going to throw a patriot in with a
[02:41:24.520 --> 02:41:27.800]  gadsden hat into the wood chipper and i'm going to throw a cop in and i'm going to sit there i'm
[02:41:27.800 --> 02:41:32.520]  going to say see we started civil war who wins the globalist because we get in the wood chipper
[02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:42.760]  we're dumb enough to climb into a wood chipper no no no no do not wear gang outfits okay to the
[02:41:42.760 --> 02:41:48.520]  young people don't use the stupid illegal drugs where an informant's probably telling you the
[02:41:48.520 --> 02:41:53.240]  drugs who's got a quota how many young people to put in jail that part of the system's evil
[02:41:53.240 --> 02:42:00.360]  it's corrupt we should change it but it isn't about the cops themselves because most of them aren't
[02:42:00.360 --> 02:42:05.720]  in the immoral job of actually being part of that they want to have a civil war in the country i
[02:42:05.720 --> 02:42:12.680]  don't want to but it just shows how the militias again 20-something years ago it's all been declassified
[02:42:12.680 --> 02:42:19.000]  has come out in federal court they would send in federal fbi leaders former special forces people
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:23.640]  and others that were experts at going into indigenous groups and leading them and they were
[02:42:23.640 --> 02:42:29.960]  and and the government would set up militias and lead them and then have them have racist ideas
[02:42:29.960 --> 02:42:35.320]  have them have anti-police ideas have them hide out be all paranoid not all the militias see the
[02:42:35.320 --> 02:42:39.080]  militias are so programmed they hear this they think i'm bashing them no no that was because feds
[02:42:39.080 --> 02:42:43.720]  were leading you and they told you when someone comes and says feds will try to infiltrate that's
[02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:50.360]  the fed no no no no no no no no no no when someone comes and explains to you that you're being
[02:42:50.360 --> 02:42:59.960]  shut up and what to look for that's the good guy a real militia is a gun club and an american history
[02:42:59.960 --> 02:43:05.880]  club where you wear sports jackets and you go and you promote shooting clubs that the ymca and the
[02:43:05.880 --> 02:43:11.160]  rotary club and the vfw and you go and speak at city council about liberty and freedom and lower
[02:43:11.160 --> 02:43:16.600]  taxes and lower property taxes and keeping school districts locally controlled and and then oh by
[02:43:16.600 --> 02:43:21.960]  the way we've got a citizen shooting group yeah we go out once a month out here to this big land
[02:43:21.960 --> 02:43:25.960]  owners place and we you know encourage young people lay on them on blankets and you know we
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:30.520]  got barbecue and all those other great sponsors and local radio stations and we have a political
[02:43:30.520 --> 02:43:36.120]  speaker and everybody gets out and shoots and you meet like-minded people it's a culture it's a
[02:43:36.120 --> 02:43:43.640]  movement that would have defeated the new world order but no they were worried about the militia
[02:43:43.640 --> 02:43:49.480]  movement resurging so they went and they created their own and they let it spectacularly into a
[02:43:49.480 --> 02:44:08.200]  rat hole into a hellhole so i don't sit up here on a high horse and say oh my gosh i've got all
[02:44:08.200 --> 02:44:12.040]  the answers but if you look at the way things really work again i've been watching a show
[02:44:12.040 --> 02:44:16.120]  from netflix called narcos and it's very historically accurate because i followed
[02:44:16.120 --> 02:44:23.000]  what happened with escobar and the rest of it it's accurate in the history not accurate in the
[02:44:23.640 --> 02:44:31.000]  dea or these good guys that raise orphaned babies and they oh they're so nice and the cia is there
[02:44:31.000 --> 02:44:37.800]  and the pentagon and when i say accurate i mean the basic stuff of what went on but not not on the
[02:44:37.800 --> 02:44:45.000]  ground if the presidents of columbia would have come out and said i'm not for the narco terrorist
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:53.720]  but by the west making drugs illegal in the 1930s they drove up the price of products that were
[02:44:53.720 --> 02:45:01.480]  bought here in columbia by the coca-cola company and dr pepper of weco texas since the 1870s 1880s
[02:45:03.240 --> 02:45:08.840]  and we are going to package the drugs as a state-run project with private contractors
[02:45:09.400 --> 02:45:13.720]  and then we're going to publicly sell it to the next country and then if the u.s buys it that's
[02:45:13.720 --> 02:45:20.520]  their issue we've always sold this this is what we do and we're going to make it not illegal because
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:28.520]  that cuts out all the drug gangs and pepe escobar and by the way they knew back then it had come
[02:45:28.520 --> 02:45:35.800]  out in the 60s the cia with opium it had come out the coca in the 70s they knew but they have it like
[02:45:35.800 --> 02:45:42.280]  the good politicians you know are against the drug lords so they work with america to try to stop it
[02:45:42.280 --> 02:45:45.400]  give me a break
[02:45:48.200 --> 02:45:54.520]  it makes me sick to see el chopo about to be extradited to the united states
[02:45:56.840 --> 02:46:05.480]  when el chopo from his earliest days was one of the only smart cartel leaders out there who
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:10.360]  long-term worked with the cia to take out the other cartels and consolidate it down to only a
[02:46:10.360 --> 02:46:14.920]  few cartels that western banks could work with because once they only had a few cartels they
[02:46:14.920 --> 02:46:20.200]  can control them and not have any of the money actually go to mexico or the people so it's
[02:46:20.200 --> 02:46:24.280]  the worst of things they're going to keep them illegal and they're going to make sure almost
[02:46:24.280 --> 02:46:27.960]  none of the money goes into mexico or anywhere else and they're going to make sure it didn't go to
[02:46:27.960 --> 02:46:32.680]  the american people goldman sacks and jp morgan have unlimited derivatives unlimited money they
[02:46:32.680 --> 02:46:37.800]  just want everything they don't want any resource to be there they've got the nerve like total devils
[02:46:37.800 --> 02:46:43.080]  to make it illegal keep it illegal since the 30s when alcohol prohibition they needed a new racket
[02:46:44.200 --> 02:46:48.840]  and then to make sure none of the money goes to anybody and then the drug money they get
[02:46:48.840 --> 02:46:55.800]  goes directly into a black hole to derivatives and is destroyed you understand the 2.2 quadrillion
[02:46:55.800 --> 02:47:01.160]  plus derivatives is to destroy all wealth and have it all fed at a debt that doesn't exist
[02:47:01.160 --> 02:47:08.440]  to kill american ingenuity they would already have space elevators and huge bases on mars
[02:47:08.440 --> 02:47:13.560]  by now but no no we're not going to have that we're going to have thousands of laboratories
[02:47:13.560 --> 02:47:18.760]  with human animal kamiro's everywhere with these people sitting there holding us back
[02:47:18.760 --> 02:47:21.960]  and then they sit there and they point their fingers just like in scarface when he's in the
[02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:28.280]  restaurant which he lived for like five years all over stoned uh i'm on a sun show friday all over
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:34.840]  stoned anyways the point is where puny montana the fictional character based on a composite of
[02:47:34.840 --> 02:47:39.160]  real people he actually lived in columbian miami for five years writing that script you know he
[02:47:39.160 --> 02:47:42.600]  didn't direct it he wrote he also wrote conan the barbarian but that's a separate issue
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:47.720]  and he points it was those are the banks they run all the drugs they control the whole thing
[02:47:47.720 --> 02:47:52.440]  we're just their frontman they've been doing it for thousands of years and that's the truth see
[02:47:52.440 --> 02:47:56.520]  and then he sits there and he's in this big fancy restaurant and he goes is this it the money you
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:48:02.440]  got a bag for a belly you look like a mummy your womb's so polluted you can't even give me a baby
[02:48:02.440 --> 02:48:07.640]  see he'd be happier in a shack in in in cuba not because a shack in cuba is good but because this
[02:48:07.640 --> 02:48:14.040]  rich artificial garbage based on fraud is so evil so he starts cussing and they're all looking sir
[02:48:14.040 --> 02:48:18.520]  sir sir he ends with a bunch of money that's all they wanted and then he goes oh you you people
[02:48:18.520 --> 02:48:25.320]  that run at all you want to point your finger and say look at the bad man well say good night to the
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:31.240]  bad man you know how sick i get when i turn on seeing inner fox and they're dripping over
[02:48:31.240 --> 02:48:37.400]  oh we got the biggest criminal in the world oh he's so rich el chopo oh he's so horrible oh he
[02:48:37.400 --> 02:48:47.320]  did all these things oh our government's so good getting him shon pin so bad shon pin literally can
[02:48:47.320 --> 02:48:56.680]  hardly tie his shoelaces sitting there pointing their finger at their own asset who they're dishonorably
[02:48:56.680 --> 02:49:04.280]  burning in front of everyone and the public's so stupid they stand for it it'd be like watching
[02:49:04.280 --> 02:49:13.160]  john goddy as the judge and the jury and the executioner over a new york mob case of a street
[02:49:13.160 --> 02:49:21.560]  level thug beating somebody up to collect a book he's dead and john goddy all proud i am gonna punish
[02:49:21.560 --> 02:49:28.440]  this horrible maximum criminal i am such an angel while he's known to be a criminal
[02:49:34.280 --> 02:49:37.480]  so that's how it works what those countries should have done
[02:49:37.480 --> 02:49:43.400]  was said the united states is run by banks that launder the drug money and run the whole thing
[02:49:43.400 --> 02:49:49.000]  they made it illegal to create the market and to cut us out of our legitimate market selling opium
[02:49:49.000 --> 02:49:53.560]  and cocaine to pharmacies in the united states where citizens could buy it legally and by the way
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:49:58.040]  abuse was much lower and so we're going to sell it to the next country and that's your problem
[02:49:58.040 --> 02:50:02.040]  you're the ones using it you handle it in your country but instead they let the propaganda
[02:50:02.040 --> 02:50:06.680]  all to let america watching us tv and movies that's what did it not the power not the military not
[02:50:06.680 --> 02:50:13.960]  the troops they always invite the vampire in no just wanting to be part of america and fly to new
[02:50:13.960 --> 02:50:20.440]  york and and be in the glitz and be in the glamour and be part of it oh yes we can fight the drug war
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:25.720]  and you wrecked your countries and 30 years later they're wrecked forever because you made a deal
[02:50:26.280 --> 02:50:32.680]  with the state apartment random 200 which states it wants to wreck your countries and states it
[02:50:32.680 --> 02:50:37.960]  wants to destabilize them and now the globalists have done this to everybody else and now they've
[02:50:37.960 --> 02:50:42.440]  got us their little piggy the united states of america and the little piggy canada and the little
[02:50:42.440 --> 02:50:46.440]  piggy germany the little piggy france and the little piggy uk and the little piggy greece and
[02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:50.360]  the little piggy spain and they got us with a big old knife for sharpening and they're putting

[02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:16.360]  you know i never liked pain before in my life but i could tolerate it and it's weird now that i've
[02:54:16.360 --> 02:54:21.960]  gotten older to see it five pain doesn't hurt as bad and sometimes it's kind of interesting
[02:54:23.560 --> 02:54:31.480]  let's go ahead and turn this up the only thing that's real the only thing that's real here's an
[02:54:31.480 --> 02:54:40.680]  example the body gets desensitized as you get older preparing you slowly for death the old familiar
[02:54:40.680 --> 02:54:43.880]  like when you were a kid and you get in the ocean all day and would burn under your arms and in
[02:54:43.880 --> 02:54:48.040]  between your legs you know now i can go swimming for like two hours in the ocean when i got a chance
[02:54:48.040 --> 02:54:53.480]  to but i remember scuba diving whatever the case is and now it's like the burning of the salt feels
[02:54:53.480 --> 02:55:02.440]  good but not a masochist but i i just see my taste changed i get older sweetest friend
[02:55:03.320 --> 02:55:15.800]  everyone i know everyone i know goes away in the you can have it all the empire of dirt
[02:55:15.800 --> 02:55:23.480]  you could have i will let you in you know donald trump is quite a paradox because he comes off
[02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:31.160]  as the perfect narcissist egomaniac i will let you down to challenge your system run by a bunch
[02:55:31.160 --> 02:55:37.800]  of psychos but is he a big enough egomaniac to want to build something great and just get out of
[02:55:37.800 --> 02:55:46.600]  way humanity's way the lord works in mysterious ways we'll see what happens
[02:55:51.160 --> 02:55:55.480]  look look at this scientific news and we've known this forever and i'm not bashing some people that
[02:55:55.480 --> 02:55:59.640]  are on antidepressants i get that they actually help some people just like a bottle of jack daniels
[02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:04.520]  every week you know helps some folks but there are negatives to it and they don't really tell you that
[02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:11.240]  and they don't tell you that every mass shooter we can think of was on serotonin reuptake inhibitors
[02:56:11.240 --> 02:56:16.840]  or antipsychotics because then they can chemically unbalance the brain so it is the suicide mass
[02:56:16.840 --> 02:56:21.800]  murder pills as i dub them on pierce morgan famously that are really causing the problem
[02:56:21.800 --> 02:56:27.560]  not the guns it's the crazy people so i'm not even blaming the suicide mass murder pills but if
[02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:32.120]  you know the shoe fits wear it i mean that's a lot more culpable than in inanimate guns
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:37.160]  it ain't lead poisoning causing the violence antidepressants can raise the risk of suicide
[02:56:37.160 --> 02:56:42.520]  biggest ever review finds that's a london telegraph article and it goes through a huge scientific group
[02:56:43.080 --> 02:56:48.200]  of studies that's something we should do a full report on very very soon this is very scary 42
[02:56:48.200 --> 02:56:52.520]  percent of democrats are in favor of socialism and identify themselves according to market watch as
[02:56:52.520 --> 02:57:00.120]  socialist i'm sorry see people look at the current paradigm how it's set out just think that's the
[02:57:00.120 --> 02:57:04.920]  way it works they don't think hey what's outside of that who you know okay socialism we all share
[02:57:04.920 --> 02:57:12.600]  everything who decides how that's redistributed why do so many rich people support communism and
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:19.560]  socialism why does socialism always end up leading to fascism or communism because wealth
[02:57:19.560 --> 02:57:25.800]  redistribution and that paradigm always rots it always accelerates it always gets more extreme
[02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:33.480]  not less and unless a robot was deciding with the surplus who to give it to here's the kind of
[02:57:33.480 --> 02:57:41.160]  socialism i'm for if you're gonna have a state like like the 50s state up there i guess that'd be
[02:57:41.160 --> 02:57:51.400]  hawaii alaska biggest state if you're gonna have giant state government owned lands then yeah give
[02:57:51.400 --> 02:57:55.640]  then yeah give every part of the citizenship a piece of that money and they're gonna buy goods and
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:58:01.880]  services and build the community that way okay i'm for that socialism if there are cases where it
[02:58:01.880 --> 02:58:06.200]  exists like that but they're few and far between but you notice you don't ever get direct socialism
[02:58:06.200 --> 02:58:11.320]  folks and by the way direct socialism ends up making you domesticated long term like feeding
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:15.320]  squirrels in your backyard or you ever seen those japanese monkeys people feed their so fat they can
[02:58:15.320 --> 02:58:22.120]  early walk you know i'm saying i'm less against that type of socialism than the others all right
[02:58:22.920 --> 02:58:27.000]  i'm gonna do five more minutes then paul joseph watson is coming up i want to get into un

[03:00:13.720 --> 03:00:19.000]  i'll tell you one thing every day i marvel at the revolution that is life the revolution
[03:00:19.000 --> 03:00:24.680]  that is consciousness in the universe some say that matter
[03:00:28.120 --> 03:00:36.040]  is god that that that god is a manifestation that creation is a manifestation of god
[03:00:37.480 --> 03:00:47.320]  and that all life is basically like part of the compound eye of a dragonfly that that god is
[03:00:47.320 --> 03:00:54.440]  experiencing consciousness in his own creation through every facet of life and its experience
[03:00:54.440 --> 03:00:58.760]  just like google wants to mark and control every piece of matter and track it in real time to
[03:00:58.760 --> 03:01:04.920]  control it god is matter god is all life god that's why we're in the image of god little g
[03:01:05.880 --> 03:01:11.000]  able to build and create because we're made in the image of the creator and and who can deny
[03:01:11.000 --> 03:01:16.760]  that that aspect of god is real and then every other aspect you can imagine because god is everything
[03:01:18.760 --> 03:01:25.000]  there's no argument against it i mean your very dna knows it's true and of course some human
[03:01:25.000 --> 03:01:31.000]  limited perception of god up on a fluffy cloud reaching down like michael angelo's sistine
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:36.520]  chapel where's that leader of da Vinci i think it's michael angelo and i've seen it that's all i know
[03:01:36.520 --> 03:01:45.160]  and you know wow to be in the sistine chapel it's amazing it's so 3d i like uh that's michael
[03:01:45.160 --> 03:01:52.200]  angelo i like choron there because that's who it's a copy of the demons like on the boats with
[03:01:52.200 --> 03:02:07.560]  the souls falling off of them stumbling into the mud swinging or driving them off into hell i tell
[03:02:07.560 --> 03:02:16.520]  you man it is a wild wild world i drive around in my car it was all these low clouds there in the
[03:02:16.520 --> 03:02:22.040]  sun behind them it just looked magic in the trees and the birds and on the life and just all
[03:02:22.040 --> 03:02:28.520]  of it is so amazing every second of it and i think about all these people that are so negative and
[03:02:28.520 --> 03:02:33.640]  it just are so unhappy because all they do is watch television all day all they do is live
[03:02:33.640 --> 03:02:40.840]  inside the system all day when the system is a limited hallucination of the establishment and
[03:02:40.840 --> 03:02:48.120]  what their worldview of things is superimposed over our view of the world which itself is a
[03:02:48.120 --> 03:02:55.000]  distortion and so all i'm saying is there's different angles like you're walking up a mountain
[03:02:55.000 --> 03:02:59.320]  path you see a gorge this way you see a waterfall that way as you get up higher you can see other
[03:02:59.320 --> 03:03:03.720]  mountains other hills you get to the top you think you see it all but you actually see less in ways
[03:03:04.840 --> 03:03:08.520]  and all i'm saying is there's different angles there's different perspectives there's different
[03:03:08.520 --> 03:03:19.080]  things happening and so understand the view you're given by the establishment is meant to limit
[03:03:19.080 --> 03:03:27.080]  your overall field of perception and the ultimate sin in my view is trying to hurt the innocence
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:31.880]  and dumb people down before they develop and to try to block the development of the species and
[03:03:31.880 --> 03:03:39.800]  all life on this planet itself and to try to overtake that and to create something blasphemously
[03:03:39.800 --> 03:03:45.560]  ugly and creates the wrong word because the system doesn't create anything they take the
[03:03:45.560 --> 03:03:51.560]  building blocks that were already there and then rearrange them in in horrid designs and then the
[03:03:51.560 --> 03:03:56.680]  establishment argues well that's what a baby does when it's to finger painting it's ugly
[03:03:56.680 --> 03:04:01.960]  but it's learning how to paint and one day it becomes a rembrant the dutch painter or a van
[03:04:01.960 --> 03:04:08.360]  go i guess another dutch painter or a manet a french painter but no a baby's painting is beautiful
[03:04:10.040 --> 03:04:13.720]  and it doesn't hurt anybody what you people create
[03:04:16.200 --> 03:04:20.680]  the quote time ban it says 500 feet high bright red and stinks horribly
[03:04:20.680 --> 03:04:27.720]  and has poisoned fruit dropping off of it that rocks on the ground and turns into little pygmy
[03:04:27.720 --> 03:04:34.680]  goblins running around chewing on life i mean just you know it's horrible it's terrible it's cancer
[03:04:35.800 --> 03:04:40.040]  so the globalists get it right they're saying we're cancer kill humanity you don't know no
[03:04:40.040 --> 03:04:45.480]  your cancer you're projecting your cancer kill yourself and i'm not saying kill yourself but
[03:04:45.480 --> 03:04:49.720]  when you want us to kill ourselves and put that message out for us to self-destruct give up lay
[03:04:49.720 --> 03:04:54.280]  down and die no i want to just say take your message back kill yourself here take that energy
[03:04:54.280 --> 03:05:00.280]  you send it out no no you kill yourselves microsoft's being technology has already called
[03:05:00.280 --> 03:05:04.920]  iowa victory for hillary clinton a result that has not gone unnoticed among bernie sanders supporters
[03:05:04.920 --> 03:05:09.640]  given that an app created by microsoft will help tally the vote during tonight's caucus using data
[03:05:09.640 --> 03:05:14.200]  from polls prediction markets and anonymize and aggregated search engine queries to predict its
[03:05:14.200 --> 03:05:18.840]  results microsoft believes hillary will win three out of the first four democratic primaries taking
[03:05:18.840 --> 03:05:23.560]  iowa south carolina and nevada while sanders takes new hampshire and is noted by paul joseph
[03:05:23.560 --> 03:05:29.160]  watson microsoft also correctly predicted the outcome of the 2015 academy awards the no vote for
[03:05:29.160 --> 03:05:34.600]  sky's independence and the outcome for over 95 of the 2014 us midterm elections and that track
[03:05:34.600 --> 03:05:38.760]  record is raising concerns among bernie sanders supporters who have pointed out potential conflict
[03:05:38.760 --> 03:05:42.600]  to interest given that precinct officials are using the app created by microsoft to count
[03:05:42.600 --> 03:05:47.400]  votes and report caucus results last week sanders iowa campaign manager questioned the impartiality
[03:05:47.400 --> 03:05:51.640]  of the app others have also pointed out that hackers could penetrate the cloud network on which
[03:05:51.640 --> 03:05:56.760]  the microsoft app runs in order to skew the vote visit info wars dot com for more election news

[03:07:56.520 --> 03:08:09.720]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[03:08:18.200 --> 03:08:21.400]  welcome back my friends is paul joseph watson from london
[03:08:21.400 --> 03:08:29.000]  we're on the behalf of the next 58 minutes so 50 52 minutes or so richard raves is in iowa
[03:08:29.720 --> 03:08:38.600]  on the caucuses full of australian in there now paul watson is uh hosting the fourth hour today
[03:08:38.600 --> 03:08:44.600]  from her britannic majesties england london and we appreciate him joining us obviously
[03:08:44.600 --> 03:08:47.800]  because there's a lot of this i didn't get to today because i think they're breaking my will
[03:08:47.800 --> 03:08:56.440]  more mass rapes more mass poopings in the pool with the raping uh more mass stabbing killing
[03:08:56.440 --> 03:09:01.480]  just constantly by the precious migrants uh french roads and it stands still because of it
[03:09:02.920 --> 03:09:07.080]  and now curt nemo has a story that i should have covered in more detail
[03:09:07.080 --> 03:09:11.080]  we're not just in europe but in the uk and also in the us they're moving to quote block
[03:09:11.080 --> 03:09:16.040]  hateful speech against the little precious seas so paul i'm sure you're getting into that the
[03:09:16.040 --> 03:09:21.720]  caucus isn't so much more uh but what do you think of microsoft with all its history of
[03:09:21.720 --> 03:09:26.600]  hanky panky running the republican and democratic sides of the iowa kickoff caucus
[03:09:27.640 --> 03:09:32.440]  and then already announcing hillary as the winner your story's been on drudgereport.com
[03:09:32.440 --> 03:09:37.880]  today uh so congratulations on your work on that we go from bernie sanders talking about it last
[03:09:37.880 --> 03:09:44.120]  week to microsoft calls iowa for hillary don't they get that that shows their bias and conflict of
[03:09:44.120 --> 03:09:52.520]  interest uh and impartiality even more well yeah and the concern obviously is that this this
[03:09:52.520 --> 03:09:57.960]  big technology that microsoft has been using to predict these results has been deadly accurate
[03:09:57.960 --> 03:10:03.320]  in the past they can't call it so well when it comes to sporting events but for things like the
[03:10:03.320 --> 03:10:09.880]  academy awards the no vote for scottish independence and according to the article the outcome of more
[03:10:09.880 --> 03:10:18.040]  than 95 percent of the us midterm elections back in 2014 they were almost deadly accurate so the
[03:10:18.040 --> 03:10:24.840]  fact that microsoft microsoft has created the app that will tally the votes i mean the the sanders
[03:10:24.840 --> 03:10:31.320]  spokesman rightly was paranoid and complaining about that last week so it is a concern given
[03:10:31.320 --> 03:10:36.520]  how close iowa is between hillary and bernie sanders i'll tell you what i like i'll tell you
[03:10:36.520 --> 03:10:43.960]  what i like human animal splice chimeras are now bbc top news every few days mit stuff that we talk
[03:10:43.960 --> 03:10:47.800]  about microsoft and election manipulation this isn't their first go around they were involved
[03:10:47.800 --> 03:10:52.680]  in machine software now that's mainstream news saying that the zika virus could be from the
[03:10:52.680 --> 03:10:58.200]  mosquitoes engineered that's now mainstream news paul almost everything we talk about a month
[03:10:58.200 --> 03:11:04.040]  or even a week out now becomes mainstream news that's that's a very exciting and i'm not trying
[03:11:04.040 --> 03:11:08.280]  to brag about info wars is happening for other alternative media as well but at what point do
[03:11:08.280 --> 03:11:15.640]  they become the dead dinosaur follower media and at what point do we become the dominant media the
[03:11:15.640 --> 03:11:20.360]  the liberty based media the open source media because we go with everything we research everything
[03:11:20.360 --> 03:11:24.520]  we're not just one little cult with people with teleprompters and you know the rest of it i mean
[03:11:24.520 --> 03:11:29.720]  what would you call this whole media battle then i'm going to punch out unless you take over well
[03:11:29.720 --> 03:11:35.400]  they've still got the control in terms of the narrative is unified so you have all the different
[03:11:35.400 --> 03:11:40.280]  networks pushing the same narrative but if you look on an individual level i mean for example
[03:11:40.840 --> 03:11:46.360]  i put out a video about the migrant crisis during that whole week where the cnn and everyone was
[03:11:46.360 --> 03:11:51.720]  freaking out hungarian camera woman trips up a migrant and it was like the shocking top story
[03:11:51.720 --> 03:11:57.960]  for a week meanwhile they're pelting rocks at hungarians robbing people you know raping people
[03:11:57.960 --> 03:12:05.080]  hijacking people's cars it wasn't outrageous yeah but i put out a video just on a backup channel
[03:12:05.080 --> 03:12:12.360]  and it got 2.2 million views showing that footage you know i put out a video about three weeks ago
[03:12:12.360 --> 03:12:19.080]  the rape of europe about the mass molestation in cologne it got 900 000 views most cnn shows aren't
[03:12:19.080 --> 03:12:24.600]  going to touch that so that's right and we've got reporters like yourself every day with all the
[03:12:24.600 --> 03:12:30.040]  videos we put out the average video say you know 50 60 000 views many of them million two million
[03:12:30.040 --> 03:12:36.520]  three million four million we're all just beavering away dominating them in the numbers we we can say
[03:12:36.520 --> 03:12:42.600]  in full wars is as big as cnn globally right now because their viewership is low but their internet
[03:12:42.600 --> 03:12:47.640]  is still huge drudge is surpassing them you know just seeing in itself he's bigger than new york
[03:12:47.640 --> 03:12:52.840]  times facebook combined drudge is much bigger than that we're smaller than drudge when it comes to
[03:12:52.840 --> 03:12:59.000]  internet traffic itself uh i mean that's got to really freak them out paul it does and that's why
[03:12:59.000 --> 03:13:04.840]  they're starting to censor comments and why is that a big deal well because studies have shown
[03:13:04.840 --> 03:13:12.360]  scientific studies that the comments below news articles sway the opinion of the reader now i called
[03:13:12.360 --> 03:13:16.680]  this about two years ago in a video i made about you said they're going to start censoring comments
[03:13:16.680 --> 03:13:21.560]  the truth is they're more red than the article that's what drives people so if they do cut
[03:13:21.560 --> 03:13:26.760]  out comments they're just killing themselves and that and sites that do do that do kill their
[03:13:26.760 --> 03:13:32.040]  traffic go ahead yeah they're killing themselves so you know it's their domain to have on their
[03:13:32.040 --> 03:13:37.320]  website what they like it's you know it's private property but once you impose that hypocritical
[03:13:37.320 --> 03:13:42.360]  form of censorship which is what it is because they're censoring one side of the debate then it's
[03:13:42.360 --> 03:13:47.400]  suicide for these websites and admittedly two years ago you know popular science was doing it
[03:13:47.400 --> 03:13:53.800]  because they said it made it harder for them to indoctrinate their readership to accept dogmas
[03:13:53.800 --> 03:13:59.800]  about man-made global warming now the guardians doing it i'm going to get into this later in their
[03:13:59.800 --> 03:14:07.480]  quote comment is free section i mean for months it's been a it's been a meme moderator has deleted
[03:14:07.480 --> 03:14:12.760]  your comment moderator has deleted your comment down for literally 20 comments in a row now they've
[03:14:12.760 --> 03:14:17.400]  announced they're just going to get rid of them all together basically on news articles about
[03:14:17.400 --> 03:14:22.200]  islam about immigration and these kind of subjects so they basically admitted defeat they're saying
[03:14:22.200 --> 03:14:26.680]  we're only going to preach to the choir only people who agree with us are going to read our
[03:14:26.680 --> 03:14:31.400]  articles to reinforce their beliefs so their audience is going to dwindle and people are
[03:14:31.400 --> 03:14:36.360]  going to flock over to us because we're the true commons of free speech and free open debate and
[03:14:36.360 --> 03:14:40.440]  by the way that's not us acting i agree paul i'm going to punch out here in a moment but
[03:14:40.440 --> 03:14:43.560]  i wanted to talk to you some because this is the one time we get to talk we're both so busy
[03:14:45.240 --> 03:14:50.120]  it's a fact that we reach billions of people every quarter on social media alone we have the
[03:14:50.120 --> 03:14:56.120]  metrics back there it's a fact we reach 28 million people a week with all of our audio video and news
[03:14:56.120 --> 03:15:00.840]  and and radio platforms and it's growing exponentially was 22 million you know just six
[03:15:00.840 --> 03:15:06.840]  months ago uh it's a fact that we're having this huge effect and have the pentagon and the white
[03:15:06.840 --> 03:15:13.480]  house countering us we're beating them but they're openly saying they're losing the info war and that
[03:15:14.040 --> 03:15:20.520]  they want to shut us and others down drudge has been told this as well uh so do you think they'll
[03:15:20.520 --> 03:15:26.040]  be successful because i really think they won't be paul if we resist and speak out and if the public
[03:15:26.040 --> 03:15:31.880]  realizes the fight is now because the genies out of the bottle people now understand the
[03:15:31.880 --> 03:15:36.120]  paradigm to a certain extent those who are thinking folks that i don't see the system being able to
[03:15:36.120 --> 03:15:41.240]  reverse this well you can just look at what happened what's happened at twitter over the past
[03:15:41.240 --> 03:15:48.280]  couple of weeks a number of top executives of twitter have stood down their stock is plummeting
[03:15:48.280 --> 03:15:54.760]  and it came right on the heels of them banning and unverifying people for example who spoke out
[03:15:54.760 --> 03:16:00.760]  against islam against radical feminism and all these kind of issues so that people are actually
[03:16:00.760 --> 03:16:06.520]  stepping down their stock price is plummeting they're losing they're losing audience share twitter
[03:16:06.520 --> 03:16:12.840]  can't attract new people but again the risk is as drudge said all our content gets segregated into
[03:16:12.840 --> 03:16:19.160]  these internet ghettos like facebook and then they say we're going to censor uh people who are
[03:16:19.160 --> 03:16:23.960]  violent and hateful towards my drudge is absolutely right we have to have our own platforms that we
[03:16:23.960 --> 03:16:29.560]  promote that has the base info like info wars dot com drudge report dot com prison planet dot com world
[03:16:29.560 --> 03:16:36.280]  and daily dot com daily caller dot com right bart dot com we have to have those but then we have to
[03:16:36.280 --> 03:16:41.880]  then infect in the globalist words all the other platforms and promote there but no they're going
[03:16:41.880 --> 03:16:46.520]  to try to shut us down but listeners need to know when they send a link or send a video or retweet
[03:16:46.520 --> 03:16:52.360]  a drudge tweet this is a war folks toe to toe with censors toe to toe with people trying to put
[03:16:52.360 --> 03:16:58.200]  communists in as president of the us i mean this is serious and then i saw the german government
[03:16:58.200 --> 03:17:05.720]  said it isn't muslims raping in cologne that was today the level of lying is so stratospheric
[03:17:06.280 --> 03:17:10.280]  i don't think governments realize how much they're discrediting themselves i mean on one hand
[03:17:10.280 --> 03:17:15.880]  they have computers that can predict the future now of mass movements but they don't know that if
[03:17:15.880 --> 03:17:22.120]  they brought in five million radical islamics that people get pissed off well that's why
[03:17:22.120 --> 03:17:26.760]  they're predicting mass civil unrest in germany and if they can import these huge crowds of
[03:17:26.760 --> 03:17:32.520]  people islamists who then pressure to pass hate speech laws then they can use those to change
[03:17:32.520 --> 03:17:37.400]  the internet you've already had feminists going in front of the un and saying people who say we
[03:17:37.400 --> 03:17:42.280]  suck or you're a liar they should have their internet access cut off so it's going to be
[03:17:42.280 --> 03:17:49.000]  introduced via those laws which then put pressure on isps directly to cut off internet access so
[03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:54.040]  that's where the free speech war is right now just as drugs warned last year here a few months ago
[03:17:54.040 --> 03:17:58.680]  in studio it's 2016 they're coming for the free speech globally zuckerberg's meeting with the
[03:17:58.680 --> 03:18:03.560]  chai com leader on how to censor the web here people go they go well don't be on facebook then
[03:18:03.560 --> 03:18:10.040]  they're coming for us next we're here at info wars but we're invading facebook with millions of
[03:18:10.040 --> 03:18:17.640]  readers a day and millions of videos being watched today millions show the idiots out there the trolls
[03:18:17.640 --> 03:18:22.040]  mainly that that want to act like we shouldn't be there they're the establishment they can't stand
[03:18:22.040 --> 03:18:27.400]  the fact that we are squatting at facebook and youtube they can't stand that we're using their
[03:18:27.400 --> 03:18:33.240]  platforms while there's still some free speech to get the word out paul yeah and you look and it
[03:18:33.240 --> 03:18:38.840]  always backfires when facebook censors somebody it's the strizand effect it always makes whatever
[03:18:38.840 --> 03:18:45.240]  they said bigger you can look at the bosh forston the guy who drew the um prophet mohammed cartoon
[03:18:45.240 --> 03:18:51.480]  back before the garland attack facebook suspended his account for posting a cartoon of mohammed
[03:18:51.480 --> 03:18:57.320]  it became a big news story now more people than ever have seen that cartoon so it always backfires
[03:18:57.320 --> 03:19:02.440]  on them and that's the positive and that's the key that's the key the key the key listen up folks
[03:19:03.400 --> 03:19:09.480]  being on the field is victory resistance is victory even when we lose we win like the alamo
[03:19:09.480 --> 03:19:16.600]  was a huge loss but a big win fighting is victory standing up to tyranny with the proper message
[03:19:16.600 --> 03:19:22.600]  is is the way we stop them we force them to censor us we force them we come back they censor us over
[03:19:22.600 --> 03:19:28.200]  and over again we just come back and back and back and back and back we never give up and we're
[03:19:28.200 --> 03:19:33.240]  winning against the enemy they're scared paul i'm gonna hand this over to you great job folks

[03:24:27.720 --> 03:24:34.040]  i'm trying not to appear obsessed with this but when every day you have major reports out of major
[03:24:34.040 --> 03:24:39.800]  european newspapers about this issue they have to be communicated they have to be translated into
[03:24:39.800 --> 03:24:45.800]  english language because the content continues to be shocking look at this headline on info wars
[03:24:45.800 --> 03:24:54.840]  dot com right now german government to spend 600 million euros housing migrants in berlin
[03:24:54.840 --> 03:25:02.440]  hotels the german government is set to spend 600 million euros housing migrants in upmarket
[03:25:02.440 --> 03:25:12.040]  berlin hotels at a cost of 18 000 euros per refugee while the city's 10 000 homeless population
[03:25:12.040 --> 03:25:17.320]  will remain on the streets that's right the government in berlin is actually
[03:25:17.880 --> 03:25:25.160]  in secret negotiating a contract with a major hotel chain to put up 10 000 migrants
[03:25:25.880 --> 03:25:34.040]  into three and four star hotels while berlin's 10 000 homeless population remains on the streets
[03:25:34.040 --> 03:25:39.000]  according to a frank furser aleman report the berlin senate is negotiating with the hotel
[03:25:39.000 --> 03:25:46.760]  chain over the long term leasing of 10 000 hotel places for refugees grand city hotels provide
[03:25:46.760 --> 03:25:54.840]  22 hotels which will include holiday inn and windham properties the 10 000 figure is noteworthy
[03:25:54.840 --> 03:26:03.400]  given that it equates to the homeless population of berlin now they've literally brought in 80 000
[03:26:03.400 --> 03:26:11.320]  and economic migrants most of whom aren't syrian refugees into berlin alone over the past year
[03:26:11.880 --> 03:26:19.000]  so they got 10 000 people on the streets homeless they bring in 80 000 economic migrants and now
[03:26:19.000 --> 03:26:26.040]  they're going to pay for 10 000 more to stay in three and four star hotels at taxpayer expense
[03:26:26.040 --> 03:26:33.640]  they could have solved berlin's homeless problem eight times over and this is how they spend the
[03:26:33.640 --> 03:26:41.720]  money the cost for each migrant will be 50 euros a night for the hotel that's 18 000 euros for each
[03:26:41.720 --> 03:26:48.040]  migrant per year just the hotel costs alone and will include a quote all inclusive program of
[03:26:48.040 --> 03:26:53.560]  care and integration quote since the senate is reportedly interested in a multi-year term of the
[03:26:53.560 --> 03:27:00.680]  lease it would amount to a volume of at least 600 million euros a source told the newspaper and
[03:27:00.680 --> 03:27:07.320]  again this newspaper went to the government to get a quote from somebody and they responded by saying
[03:27:07.320 --> 03:27:13.480]  you're not supposed to know about that that's not public because they were conducting this
[03:27:13.480 --> 03:27:20.360]  secret no bid contract to strip out any competitive aspect with this hotel chain
[03:27:20.360 --> 03:27:26.120]  the deal is attracted to the hotel chain because the government would guarantee an occupancy rate
[03:27:26.120 --> 03:27:33.880]  of 95 compared to the usual figure of 60 to 65 percent so these hotels they were going to be 30
[03:27:33.880 --> 03:27:41.320]  35 empty on average throughout the year now thanks to this government contract they're basically
[03:27:41.320 --> 03:27:48.040]  going to be full of migrants the same kind of migrants who were out on the streets on new
[03:27:48.040 --> 03:27:54.840]  years eve not all of them but many of them raping molesting stealing from the women of
[03:27:54.840 --> 03:28:00.360]  cologne of course the feminists in cologne responded to that by visiting the city's largest
[03:28:00.360 --> 03:28:08.280]  migrant center did they protest no they handed out roses and apologized for xenophobia so now
[03:28:08.280 --> 03:28:14.040]  that german government's paying 600 million euros in tax pay and money to house these refugees
[03:28:14.040 --> 03:28:22.120]  again 80 000 asylum seekers arrived in berlin alone last year part of the 1.1 million that
[03:28:22.120 --> 03:28:28.520]  has flooded into germany in 2015 alone in other words berlin could have completely solved its
[03:28:28.520 --> 03:28:34.040]  homeless problem eight times over yet will instead use tax pay money to fund accommodation for
[03:28:34.040 --> 03:28:39.960]  non-germans flooding in from the middle east and north africa which will no doubt please the
[03:28:39.960 --> 03:28:46.840]  german green party politician who got up in front of the parliament a few months ago and bragged
[03:28:46.840 --> 03:28:55.080]  about how wonderful it was that germans would be a minority in major german cities within 30 years
[03:28:55.080 --> 03:29:02.760]  she said that was quote a good thing and that will this program will accelerate that process
[03:29:02.760 --> 03:29:08.600]  critics alleged that the deal is wide open to corruption and abuse because it was conducted
[03:29:08.600 --> 03:29:13.880]  because it was conducted secretly via no bid contracts again we weren't supposed to find out
[03:29:13.880 --> 03:29:20.440]  about this but the german newspaper uncovered a source and the details were revealed authorities
[03:29:20.440 --> 03:29:26.440]  in berlin have already confiscated 50 gymnasiums just in berlin alone as well as office and bank
[03:29:26.440 --> 03:29:32.360]  buildings to house migrants arriving in the city and again top psychiatrists are saying that angela
[03:29:32.360 --> 03:29:38.840]  merkel is having a breakdown mass protests in germany against so we got a video of that in this
[03:29:38.840 --> 03:29:42.920]  article and again more craziness coming up wait until you see what's coming up in the video after
[03:29:42.920 --> 03:29:49.480]  the break this is the four power live info wars dot com we'll be right back we're on the march the
[03:29:49.480 --> 03:30:00.120]  empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network the islamic state is threatening to
[03:30:00.120 --> 03:30:04.760]  launch an attack on london so terrible that it will turn children's hair white the extremist
[03:30:04.760 --> 03:30:09.320]  group published an article in its arabic language newspaper stating a doomsday attack would take
[03:30:09.320 --> 03:30:14.280]  place on british soil isis claimed the uk would receive the lion's share of its european terrorist
[03:30:14.280 --> 03:30:18.200]  attacks threat is apparently a response to uk's decision to extend its aerial bombing campaign
[03:30:18.200 --> 03:30:22.200]  against the islamic state it also promises to carry out follow-up attacks through the paris
[03:30:22.200 --> 03:30:26.840]  massacre in november which left 130 dead and more than 300 injured the islamic state finally
[03:30:26.840 --> 03:30:31.160]  referenced a verse of the quran which discusses judgment day stating the attack on britain will
[03:30:31.160 --> 03:30:35.720]  be so horrific it will turn children's hair to white the threat will no doubt fuel concerns that
[03:30:35.720 --> 03:30:40.520]  jihadists are exploiting the refugee crisis to slip into e u undetected by using fake passports so
[03:30:40.520 --> 03:30:44.200]  they can launch terrorist attacks on british soil if there is a terrorist attack it's likely the
[03:30:44.200 --> 03:30:48.280]  uk government will exploit it to enact a police state just like france especially considering
[03:30:48.280 --> 03:30:52.760]  that nato has been arming and funding isis as a proxy army gives syria for quite some time you

[03:34:52.280 --> 03:34:59.480]  article the german government is basically going to spend 600 million euros of taxpayer money to
[03:34:59.480 --> 03:35:05.880]  house quote refugees many of whom are just economic migrants trying to get on european benefits
[03:35:06.440 --> 03:35:14.680]  in three and four star hotels in berlin they're talking about taking 10 000 migrants and putting
[03:35:14.680 --> 03:35:21.880]  them up in these hotels meanwhile berlin's 10 000 population of homeless people will remain on the
[03:35:21.880 --> 03:35:27.880]  street so again it goes back to that argument you know even if we had socialism we can't even have
[03:35:27.880 --> 03:35:33.800]  direct socialism they could have solved their own home homeless population eight times over given the
[03:35:33.800 --> 03:35:39.560]  amount of refugees they brought in over the last year 80 000 in berlin alone they're using
[03:35:39.560 --> 03:35:45.800]  gymnasiums they're using disused office space banks that have shut down and they simply run out
[03:35:45.800 --> 03:35:52.920]  of room so now the government of germany is doing a secret no bid deal with this hotel chain
[03:35:52.920 --> 03:35:57.880]  who are completely happy with it because they're going to have 95 occupancy for the foreseeable
[03:35:57.880 --> 03:36:04.920]  future to put up these 10 000 migrants initially just 10 000 maybe more to follow while berlin's
[03:36:04.920 --> 03:36:09.800]  homeless population remains on the streets again they would rather take care of these economic
[03:36:09.800 --> 03:36:15.160]  migrants than actual german citizens who are struggling which we've seen before with government
[03:36:15.160 --> 03:36:20.840]  housing in germany people being kicked out of government housing germans in order to make
[03:36:20.840 --> 03:36:28.120]  way for these migrants 1.1 million of which have arrived in germany over the past year now staying
[03:36:28.120 --> 03:36:34.760]  on that issue you will remember back in september we had this story german schools order girls
[03:36:34.760 --> 03:36:41.320]  not to wear short skirts to avoid offending muslim migrants schools in germany are ordering
[03:36:41.320 --> 03:36:46.200]  teenage girls not to wear mini skirts or shorts so as to prevent attacks from muslim migrants
[03:36:46.200 --> 03:36:53.320]  who may be offended by such attire so this was a pocking bavaria school again they had a gymnasium
[03:36:53.320 --> 03:36:59.320]  set aside for the migrants it was right next to the school the headmaster sent out a letter to
[03:36:59.320 --> 03:37:05.000]  the parents saying if you don't want your teenage daughter to be attacked by these migrants and
[03:37:05.000 --> 03:37:13.240]  sexually molested you better tell her to cover up maybe wear a burqa maybe that will do it doesn't
[03:37:13.240 --> 03:37:18.600]  help the muslim women in migrant camps they're still being raped and molested so we've had schools
[03:37:18.600 --> 03:37:24.120]  telling parents that they need their children to cover up for months and months and now we have this
[03:37:24.120 --> 03:37:30.280]  a town hall meeting in the german town of bad schlemmer and we've got the video we're going to
[03:37:30.280 --> 03:37:35.560]  play in a second where they've got a mayor of this town up in front of in front of a packed
[03:37:35.560 --> 03:37:41.560]  audience in this town hall and a grandfather is basically saying he's concerned about his
[03:37:41.560 --> 03:37:47.160]  teenage granddaughters being attacked being molested by these migrants who are in who are
[03:37:47.160 --> 03:37:52.760]  staying in the nearby school or staying in a building nearby the school the mayor responds
[03:37:52.760 --> 03:38:01.080]  by saying don't walk near the school he then says basically cover up don't let your teenage daughters
[03:38:01.720 --> 03:38:09.880]  wear skimpy attire so imagine the outrage if a prominent official had said you know just cover
[03:38:09.880 --> 03:38:15.320]  up it's not it's not it's the rapist it's not the rapist fault that this mass molestation is
[03:38:15.320 --> 03:38:20.920]  happening it's your fault for not wearing the right clothes for wearing miniskirts blaming the
[03:38:20.920 --> 03:38:27.080]  victim of course feminists would be completely outraged not feminists in cologne who are giving
[03:38:27.080 --> 03:38:33.000]  migrant who are giving migrants roses in the biggest refugee center in cologne which almost
[03:38:33.000 --> 03:38:39.560]  certainly contains some of the same rapists who sexually molested women in cologne so this video
[03:38:39.560 --> 03:38:44.040]  is in german but i'm gonna translate i'm gonna talk over it so let's go to this video now
[03:38:45.320 --> 03:38:50.520]  so the grandfather says i have a question regarding the school about physical education
[03:38:50.520 --> 03:38:55.800]  in the school gym my granddaughter she's under 10 and it also happened in a nearby town the girls
[03:38:55.800 --> 03:39:02.360]  have been harassed by the refugee children the asylum seekers again this is a town hall they
[03:39:02.360 --> 03:39:08.360]  get harassed from the windows of the shelter and things like that he's talking to the mayor
[03:39:08.360 --> 03:39:13.640]  how will this be in the summer when the school girls wear less clothing
[03:39:13.640 --> 03:39:21.720]  men says that's easy just don't provoke them don't walk in these areas now the audience
[03:39:21.720 --> 03:39:27.800]  starts to go into an uproar oh in your own country you can't even walk in your own city anymore
[03:39:29.000 --> 03:39:33.800]  so they're in uproar they're cat calling they're booing the mayor because he basically said
[03:39:33.800 --> 03:39:39.480]  these girls shouldn't be able to walk in their own city they shouldn't be able to go near the
[03:39:39.480 --> 03:39:45.960]  migrant camp because they might get molested by the migrants so he goes on who the hell elected
[03:39:45.960 --> 03:39:52.600]  you basically it turns into a massive shouting fest and the mayor towards the end of the video
[03:39:53.720 --> 03:39:59.960]  they call for him to step down he goes on to basically say it's technically not necessary
[03:39:59.960 --> 03:40:07.320]  for the girls to walk there there are alternative routes for going to the school so he's saying
[03:40:07.320 --> 03:40:13.400]  that these teenage girls should not be able to walk past this area that the parents should discourage
[03:40:13.400 --> 03:40:19.080]  them from doing so and that that's the only way to prevent these molestations from these migrants
[03:40:19.640 --> 03:40:24.040]  not that there's an issue with importing the migrants in the frigging first place
[03:40:24.600 --> 03:40:29.640]  not that there's an issue with having to train them not to molest women like they're doing in
[03:40:29.640 --> 03:40:34.600]  Denmark and other countries but no it's the german people's fault in fact in this video
[03:40:34.600 --> 03:40:41.480]  the mayor goes on to say oh german sexually molest women all the time too what's the big deal
[03:40:42.120 --> 03:40:48.600]  so he's actually blaming it just as feminists did in Cologne on the german people saying that
[03:40:48.600 --> 03:40:53.880]  they need to have their daughters cover up maybe we're a burka that they shouldn't go near the
[03:40:53.880 --> 03:41:00.600]  refugee center that's near their school again we've had top officials in Germany saying that the
[03:41:00.600 --> 03:41:06.840]  mass molestation of women in Cologne what's equally as bad as that is quote right wing
[03:41:06.840 --> 03:41:14.840]  conservatives leaving comments on internet message boards critical of migrants this is the reaction
[03:41:14.840 --> 03:41:22.840]  from prominent german politicians and mayors to these molestations of women to this rape epidemic
[03:41:22.840 --> 03:41:29.560]  that has swept Germany that is being covered up by the police admittedly in their own words
[03:41:29.560 --> 03:41:36.920]  so as not to legitimize critics of mass migration so now you've got peace people are basically an
[03:41:36.920 --> 03:41:42.360]  uproar i mean i talked about it earlier top german security experts have warned Merkel
[03:41:42.360 --> 03:41:48.360]  if this policy is not reversed it's going to cause mass civil unrest but the response of
[03:41:48.360 --> 03:41:53.960]  the german government has not been to significantly scale back this program it's not been to address
[03:41:53.960 --> 03:42:00.280]  the fact that they've now got a rape epidemic sweeping the country it's to ban people on facebook
[03:42:00.280 --> 03:42:06.840]  ban germans on facebook from making comments critical of migrants and we saw what tone that
[03:42:06.840 --> 03:42:13.000]  took in the Netherlands this this wasn't hate filled violent speech being made against the migrants
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:18.120]  it was somebody for example in a dutch town who said that he thought his government's refugee
[03:42:18.120 --> 03:42:25.240]  policy of allowing these refugees into the country was a quote bad plan those were his words a bad
[03:42:25.240 --> 03:42:33.560]  plan what happened he along with other people in that one town alone got a home visit from the police
[03:42:33.560 --> 03:42:41.000]  who warned him as to his future conduct on social media so they're not clamping down on the actual
[03:42:41.000 --> 03:42:47.800]  migrants molesting women molesting young girls they're clamping down on people who criticize it
[03:42:47.800 --> 03:42:53.480]  and people who criticize that policy in the first place now if you go watch this video and it'll be
[03:42:53.480 --> 03:42:59.960]  up on informers.com later again just total uproar in the crowd a packed house in this town hall
[03:42:59.960 --> 03:43:06.840]  meeting the mayor is blaming the german people for this problem and saying your school your
[03:43:06.840 --> 03:43:11.720]  daughter shouldn't go near the refugee center and that that is the solution to the problem
[03:43:12.360 --> 03:43:16.360]  just find a different route to get to school because if you go near that place
[03:43:16.360 --> 03:43:20.520]  they might molest you and oh and by the way it's your fault because you didn't tell them to cover
[03:43:20.520 --> 03:43:28.680]  up enough completely outrageous we continue to see examples of this day after day after day over
[03:43:28.680 --> 03:43:38.760]  in austria rt reports austria to deport 50 000 asylum seekers by 2019 will offer 500 euros to
[03:43:38.760 --> 03:43:44.280]  those leaving voluntarily so now the taxpayers are having to pay to house them all the taxpayers
[03:43:44.280 --> 03:43:50.840]  are going to have to pay to make them leave 500 euros a piece for tens of thousands of migrants
[03:43:50.840 --> 03:43:56.200]  that they've let in now realize that they're being overwhelmed and now they're trying to convince them
[03:43:56.200 --> 03:44:02.280]  to leave austria plans to deport 50 000 failed asylum seekers within the next four years after
[03:44:02.280 --> 03:44:08.520]  vienna mps last week approved a bill toughening our mission policies for migrants i think 50 000 is
[03:44:08.520 --> 03:44:13.880]  realistic in terms of a number to deport austrian foreign minister sebastian kurt stated and you
[03:44:13.880 --> 03:44:21.720]  can see his comments in this article last year austria had 90 000 asylum applications the number is
[03:44:21.720 --> 03:44:27.880]  too high for a small country measured in terms of population it's the second highest in europe
[03:44:27.880 --> 03:44:34.120]  after sweden so now they're finally beginning to realize that this is changing the makeup of the
[03:44:34.120 --> 03:44:43.160]  society just like in german villages of 100 200 people they get overwhelmed by an influx of
[03:44:43.160 --> 03:44:49.320]  a thousand migrants of course it changes the village these migrants have nothing to do they're
[03:44:49.320 --> 03:44:55.560]  hanging around on the streets they're intimidating women and people are up in arms about this while
[03:44:55.560 --> 03:45:03.000]  the german government desperately tries to find buildings gymnasiums disused office warehouses
[03:45:03.000 --> 03:45:08.760]  to try and hide to try and house all these migrants it's falling apart very quickly and it's only
[03:45:08.760 --> 03:45:14.760]  going to intensify as we move towards the summer because they've already lowered the drawbridge
[03:45:14.760 --> 03:45:19.160]  and even though critics including in fours dot com have been warning that this would happen
[03:45:19.720 --> 03:45:26.120]  for months and months and months it's only intensifying and yet the solution is oh let's just
[03:45:26.120 --> 03:45:32.600]  blame the german people and say stop making xenophobic comments cover up your daughters in
[03:45:32.600 --> 03:45:38.760]  burkas and that's going to solve the problem completely outrageous but it continues to worsen
[03:45:38.760 --> 03:45:46.120]  day by day which is why we continue to cover it switching gears though we touched upon it earlier
[03:45:46.120 --> 03:45:54.840]  when alex was on the air websites are now making moves to ban comments entirely to censor online
[03:45:54.840 --> 03:46:00.600]  comments in response to news articles now this is an issue that i covered a couple of years ago in
[03:46:00.600 --> 03:46:08.280]  a video and why is it important it's because scientific studies have shown that the online
[03:46:08.280 --> 03:46:17.000]  comments made in response to news articles sway the opinion of the reader that's why the likes of
[03:46:17.000 --> 03:46:22.520]  the guardian now and in fact popular science two years ago took steps to do this are outright
[03:46:22.520 --> 03:46:29.800]  banning comments on certain subjects got this article out of bright bar dot com the guardian
[03:46:29.800 --> 03:46:35.640]  shuts down reader comments as the left war on dissent continues the guardian has announced it
[03:46:35.640 --> 03:46:41.640]  will close comments underneath articles on race immigration and islam the reason according to
[03:46:41.640 --> 03:46:47.800]  the ultra progressive newspaper is that such topics attract a quote unacceptable level of toxic
[03:46:47.800 --> 03:46:53.800]  commentary the guardians new policy stipulates that comments will only be opened under articles
[03:46:53.800 --> 03:47:00.040]  covering those topics if moderators have the capacity to support the conversation now as i
[03:47:00.040 --> 03:47:07.400]  said before the guardian has become notorious for deleting comments which disagree with the
[03:47:07.400 --> 03:47:16.040]  progressive or regressive as it actually is dogma of the article itself it's become a mean
[03:47:16.040 --> 03:47:22.280]  you know comment deleted by moderator comment deleted by moderator comment deleted by moderator
[03:47:22.280 --> 03:47:29.880]  for 2030 comments in a row that became a meme on twitter a few weeks ago now they're just saying
[03:47:29.880 --> 03:47:35.320]  they're going to go ahead for certain topics like islam and immigration and not allow any
[03:47:35.320 --> 03:47:43.400]  comments whatsoever in the section of their website called common is free that's the hypocrisy of this
[03:47:43.400 --> 03:47:48.120]  you can make the argument that you know it's a it's basically private property they can allow
[03:47:48.120 --> 03:47:54.600]  what they want on their own website which is true but don't then claim comment is free and that it's
[03:47:54.600 --> 03:48:01.400]  a fair commons and that it's a balanced debate because it's not it's censorship and it's done
[03:48:01.400 --> 03:48:07.560]  because as i said it's proven that comments sway the opinion of the reader and if you go to some
[03:48:07.560 --> 03:48:15.240]  of these articles the content of the article is so often trashed and annihilated by people
[03:48:15.240 --> 03:48:21.560]  in the reader comments they don't like that they don't like other people seizing control of the
[03:48:21.560 --> 03:48:29.080]  narrative just as the bbc and cnn went nuts for a week over the hungarian camera woman tripping
[03:48:29.080 --> 03:48:35.160]  a migrant like that was some massive human rights abuse yet they don't show the migrants attacking
[03:48:35.160 --> 03:48:40.280]  people they don't show the rape epidemic before cologne they don't show any of this because
[03:48:40.280 --> 03:48:46.040]  they're trying to steer the narrative that this migrant crisis is all about poor syrian refugee
[03:48:46.040 --> 03:48:53.080]  families which overwhelmingly the fact show it's not so it's all about steering the narrative
[03:48:53.960 --> 03:48:58.840]  and now the guardian has come out and said they're just going to ban comments on these subjects
[03:48:58.840 --> 03:49:04.600]  all together we got this article from informers.com by Kurt Nimmo on the same subject corporate
[03:49:04.600 --> 03:49:10.680]  media closes down toxic comments on migration islam gender and race he points out in the past
[03:49:10.680 --> 03:49:15.640]  government and corporate control of media effectively stifled mass political movements
[03:49:15.640 --> 03:49:20.760]  but with the advent of the open internet this has changed the elite have reacted to this new
[03:49:20.760 --> 03:49:26.680]  found freedom by formulating regulations and proposing laws in september the globalist united
[03:49:26.680 --> 03:49:31.640]  nation broadband commission for digital development released a worldwide wake-up call and proposed
[03:49:31.640 --> 03:49:37.560]  social media quote proactively police every profile and post and that government agencies only
[03:49:37.560 --> 03:49:43.560]  licensed those who agreed to do so so again it goes back to what i was talking about you had these
[03:49:43.560 --> 03:49:52.040]  two feminists zoe quinn and anita sarkeesian get up in front of the un and say we need to stop this
[03:49:52.040 --> 03:49:59.960]  hate speech what they define as hate speech is people disagreeing with them on twitter those
[03:49:59.960 --> 03:50:06.600]  were the that was the example they use they said people who say you suck or you're a liar that's
[03:50:06.600 --> 03:50:13.240]  hate speech government should put pressure on internet service providers to ban those people
[03:50:13.240 --> 03:50:20.280]  from using the internet so this is way beyond soap and pipper this is a massive end run on free
[03:50:20.280 --> 03:50:24.520]  speech but as we talked about with alex it's going to blow up in their face because you have
[03:50:24.520 --> 03:50:29.240]  the strides and effect if you try to censor something it only gets bigger and bigger and
[03:50:29.240 --> 03:50:36.040]  and it's just going to send more traffic to websites that allow open and free debate on the
[03:50:36.040 --> 03:50:41.960]  current affairs of our time they're going to lose their traffic we're going to gain more traffic

[03:54:22.280 --> 03:54:28.040]  at involvewars.com before the break i was talking about these new efforts by leftist
[03:54:28.040 --> 03:54:33.880]  media websites to censor comments to remove the ability to comment on their news stories
[03:54:33.880 --> 03:54:39.800]  entirely because people are shifting the narrative there god forbid disagreeing with the author of
[03:54:39.800 --> 03:54:47.400]  the article and that ties into this article at the daily caller poll 91% of americans aren't
[03:54:47.400 --> 03:54:52.200]  worried about global warming as iowans prepare to vote presidential candidates a new polar
[03:54:52.200 --> 03:54:56.840]  surface showing once again the vast majority of americans don't rank global warming as the most
[03:54:56.840 --> 03:55:04.200]  serious issue facing the country the uguf poll of 18 000 people in 17 countries found only 9.2%
[03:55:04.200 --> 03:55:10.040]  of americans rank global warming as their biggest concern only saudi arabians were less concerned
[03:55:10.040 --> 03:55:17.000]  about global warming so again we had popular science two years ago killing comments on their
[03:55:17.000 --> 03:55:23.960]  website because they said that it was making making it harder for them to indoctrinate people
[03:55:23.960 --> 03:55:29.080]  about global warming which means of course people were in the comments disagreeing with
[03:55:29.080 --> 03:55:34.840]  the crap that was written in the article with you know outgaugh's predictions of an ice free
[03:55:34.840 --> 03:55:41.560]  Arctic by 2014 for example so we can't have people reading that so they basically just killed their
[03:55:41.560 --> 03:55:47.320]  comments now we've got a new poll 91% of americans aren't worried about global warming so again they're
[03:55:47.320 --> 03:55:54.520]  completely failing to control this narrative got another article here out of gateway pundit
[03:55:55.160 --> 03:56:01.560]  sunny cleric tortured and murdered after denouncing ices the lifeless body of yemen's
[03:56:01.560 --> 03:56:07.880]  top solar p cleric in the southern port city of aiden was found disfigured sunday hours after
[03:56:07.880 --> 03:56:15.400]  he was abducted following an anti extremism sermon security officials said so basically this top cleric
[03:56:15.400 --> 03:56:23.400]  was extremely brave he came out with a sermon denouncing extremist islam denouncing ices
[03:56:23.400 --> 03:56:32.520]  denouncing al qaeda the very next day he was kidnapped tortured and killed again this goes
[03:56:32.520 --> 03:56:38.840]  back to the point i've made in my videos extremist islam is upheld by so-called
[03:56:38.840 --> 03:56:44.280]  moderate muslims we've shown the footage of people at conferences where prominent islamic
[03:56:44.280 --> 03:56:51.240]  speakers get up and say why is the media framing the idea that stoning women to death for adultery
[03:56:51.240 --> 03:56:58.760]  is bad is bad you know throwing gaze off buildings is bad and that these are extremist islamic
[03:56:58.760 --> 03:57:04.600]  beliefs when they're not when moderate muslims have these beliefs and then if you look at the
[03:57:04.600 --> 03:57:11.480]  pure research polls into muslim attitudes and into sharia law you will see that vast numbers the
[03:57:11.480 --> 03:57:17.800]  majority in many middle eastern north african countries support sharia law support stoning
[03:57:17.800 --> 03:57:23.880]  women to death for allegedly committing adultery support throwing gaze off buildings support
[03:57:23.880 --> 03:57:31.640]  executing people who leave the faith of islam these are what we call moderate muslims so now this
[03:57:31.640 --> 03:57:39.000]  brave yemeny cleric comes out of the speech denouncing ices the very next day he's killed
[03:57:39.000 --> 03:57:46.760]  by moderate muslims election news out of brightbot.com pat caddell when we're in a pre-revolutionary
[03:57:46.760 --> 03:57:53.000]  moment citing new data just received today longtime pollster pat caddell called this year's primary
[03:57:53.000 --> 03:57:59.960]  a pre-revolutionary moment and i think we've passed into something bigger he added so again you've
[03:57:59.960 --> 03:58:05.480]  got the elite petrified about donald trump because he's a loose cannon whether you agree with his
[03:58:05.480 --> 03:58:12.920]  politics or not they don't control him he's funded his own campaign entirely the davos elite petrified
[03:58:12.920 --> 03:58:18.440]  top builder burgers are coming out and saying we got to stop donald trump and now pollster pat caddell
[03:58:18.440 --> 03:58:23.560]  is saying that this is a pre-revolutionary moment even if you disagree with bernie sanders he's on
[03:58:23.560 --> 03:58:29.160]  the other side of that again they don't control him they don't control trump the elite is petrified
[03:58:29.160 --> 03:58:33.960]  as to what's going to happen in 2016 that's going to wrap it up for the show breaking news info wars
