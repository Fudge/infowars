[00:00.000 --> 00:25.400]  This is Uncle Sam with Music and the Truth Until Dawn.
[00:25.400 --> 00:29.360]  Right now I got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[00:29.360 --> 00:33.360]  The chair is against the wall. John has a long mustache.
[00:33.360 --> 00:36.360]  This is the heart of 1776.
[00:36.360 --> 00:39.360]  It's 12 o'clock Americans, another day closer to victory.
[00:39.360 --> 01:07.360]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[01:07.360 --> 01:12.360]  Well, BlackRock and Larry in particular are a great example of private sector leadership.
[01:12.360 --> 01:19.360]  You know, anyone who says that climate shouldn't be a factor in how you evaluate the future of a company, you know, isn't...
[01:19.360 --> 01:31.360]  That's not capitalism because companies that have emissions, you know, they are going to be subject to border adjustment tariffs or taxes.
[01:31.360 --> 01:38.360]  You also have to think about companies, you know, if you're dealing with severe weather events, that's got to be factored in.
[01:38.360 --> 01:42.360]  Is the company ensuring that? Are they becoming more resilient?
[01:42.360 --> 01:50.360]  So the attacks are kind of illogical because climate does affect the economy, which does affect investments.
[01:50.360 --> 01:56.360]  The idea that we still need oil and natural gas is also, you know, fairly clear.
[01:56.360 --> 01:59.360]  We're not going to drain all the money away from those sectors.
[01:59.360 --> 02:03.360]  It's how people get to work today. It's how people avoid freezing to death in the winter.
[02:03.360 --> 02:10.360]  And, you know, people did get a little optimistic about how quickly the transition could be done.
[02:10.360 --> 02:18.360]  Now without the Russian natural gas being available in Europe, you know, it's a setback.
[02:18.360 --> 02:23.360]  You know, we need to find non-Russian hydrocarbon sources to substitute for those.
[02:23.360 --> 02:31.360]  So there's coal plants running and a variety of things because, you know, keeping, you know, people warm,
[02:31.360 --> 02:36.360]  keeping those economies in decent shape is a priority.
[02:36.360 --> 02:43.360]  Now on the other hand, it's good for the long run because people won't want to be dependent on Russian natural gas.
[02:43.360 --> 02:47.360]  So they'll move to these new approaches more rapidly.
[02:47.360 --> 02:49.360]  And you talk about companies protecting themselves.
[02:49.360 --> 02:56.360]  What do you think about the Fed's stress testing banks for climate?
[02:56.360 --> 03:01.360]  That's the SEGs. It's Wednesday, October 19th, 2022.
[03:01.360 --> 03:11.360]  And the most important issue ever to take place in the human history of our planet is hiding in plain view.
[03:11.360 --> 03:18.360]  And I'm very angry at myself because what I talk about, what the great danger is, I did yesterday.
[03:18.360 --> 03:24.360]  Because I already knew this and I was already very close to this and we've already talked about it at Nazism,
[03:24.360 --> 03:27.360]  but it's admitted now publicly.
[03:27.360 --> 03:32.360]  It was admitted in the documents and the reports and the rest of it, but here it is.
[03:32.360 --> 03:35.360]  And what am I talking about?
[03:35.360 --> 03:39.360]  End of the world type stuff, gain of function.
[03:39.360 --> 03:47.360]  Peter Dazik, Fauci, Bill Gates, they are like the 12 monkey cult in that great 1990s film of Bruce Willis
[03:47.360 --> 03:54.360]  where these elite cult biomedical scientists release a virus that kills everybody that comes in contact with it.
[03:54.360 --> 04:03.360]  They have developed not dozens, not hundreds, but thousands of different strains and different varieties of viruses
[04:03.360 --> 04:10.360]  that kill 99% of people that come in contact.
[04:10.360 --> 04:16.360]  And I've gone and pulled some of the older articles, but yesterday it broke and I mentioned it as a footnote
[04:16.360 --> 04:21.360]  and thank God it became a bigger story yesterday and everybody else is covering it and that's good news.
[04:21.360 --> 04:28.360]  But it just proves Fauci lied to Congress and all the rest of it that in Boston, at Boston University,
[04:28.360 --> 04:35.360]  they develop with human mice clones, they're mice that have human DNA, so it's exactly the same as humans,
[04:35.360 --> 04:40.360]  80% kill rate with a COVID.
[04:40.360 --> 04:44.360]  Now I told you that stuff way worse than they released, that was just the beta test.
[04:44.360 --> 04:49.360]  I'm going to tell you what's going on and I'm telling you, they could eminently release this and wipe everybody up.
[04:49.360 --> 04:54.360]  COVID was the beta test to see if we would stand down and stand our houses and die when they do it.
[04:54.360 --> 05:00.360]  They're preparing to kill everyone. Stay with us.
[05:00.360 --> 05:05.360]  It's our best seller. We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[05:05.360 --> 05:11.360]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them,
[05:11.360 --> 05:17.360]  it has become our number one overall best seller and it's been sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock.
[05:17.360 --> 05:24.360]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[05:24.360 --> 05:31.360]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[05:31.360 --> 05:37.360]  Essential means without these things you die and so much the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment.
[05:37.360 --> 05:41.360]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[05:41.360 --> 05:48.360]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there but this is amongst the very best and it's a low price and it funds the inforward.
[05:48.360 --> 05:56.360]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting vitamin mineral fusion finally back in stock at inforwardstore.com for a 50% off.
[05:56.360 --> 06:08.360]  Vitamin mineral fusion back in stock at inforwardstore.com.
[06:26.360 --> 06:34.360]  They created a COVID superweapon with a 80% kill rate and it's in a lab right now in Boston, Massachusetts.
[06:34.360 --> 06:40.360]  On top of it they admittedly want depopulation or part of the globalist proto-Nazi cult.
[06:40.360 --> 06:45.360]  12 monkeys is a movie, this is reality.
[06:45.360 --> 06:53.360]  Excuse me sir, would you mind letting me have a look at the contents of your bag please?
[06:53.360 --> 07:03.360]  Excuse me.
[07:03.360 --> 07:06.360]  Biological samples.
[07:06.360 --> 07:09.360]  I have the papers right here.
[07:09.360 --> 07:12.360]  I'm going to have to ask you to open this up sir.
[07:12.360 --> 07:15.360]  Open it?
[07:15.360 --> 07:18.360]  Yes of course.
[07:18.360 --> 07:23.360]  This should be better. Come on over here and look at the planks. Hurry up.
[07:23.360 --> 07:25.360]  Excuse me sir.
[07:25.360 --> 07:29.360]  See? Biological. Check the papers.
[07:29.360 --> 07:31.360]  It's all proper.
[07:31.360 --> 07:38.360]  Have a permit.
[07:38.360 --> 07:39.360]  It's empty.
[07:39.360 --> 07:44.360]  Well, yes to be sure. It looks empty.
[07:44.360 --> 07:47.360]  I assure you it's not.
[07:47.360 --> 07:49.360]  No ma'am, I don't have to understand you.
[07:49.360 --> 07:51.360]  This is very important.
[07:51.360 --> 07:53.360]  You cannot get out of here.
[07:53.360 --> 08:00.360]  There you see. Also invisible to the naked eye.
[08:00.360 --> 08:05.360]  It doesn't even have an odor.
[08:05.360 --> 08:07.360]  That's not necessary sir.
[08:07.360 --> 08:12.360]  There you go. Thank you for your cooperation. Have a good flight.
[08:12.360 --> 08:19.360]  Yeah.
[08:19.360 --> 08:21.360]  Where are you calling a mom?
[08:21.360 --> 08:23.360]  I am calling you.
[08:23.360 --> 08:27.360]  Get your hands up.
[08:27.360 --> 08:28.360]  Call it.
[08:28.360 --> 08:35.360]  Give me a moment.
[08:35.360 --> 08:50.360]  There he is. That man is carrying it.
[08:50.360 --> 08:53.360]  Stop him. Please stop him.
[08:53.360 --> 09:00.360]  Police officer.
[09:00.360 --> 09:07.360]  Police officer.
[09:07.360 --> 09:11.360]  Police officer.
[09:11.360 --> 09:25.360]  Watch it.
[09:25.360 --> 09:32.360]  Police officer.
[09:32.360 --> 09:36.360]  Silence infowars before they can stop the real biological attack that's coming.
[09:36.360 --> 09:38.360]  And they will kill you and your family.
[09:38.360 --> 09:40.360]  Most of you will be dead soon and we don't stop them.
[09:40.360 --> 09:42.360]  You're going to be in your houses and everything's locked down.
[09:42.360 --> 09:43.360]  The power is off and you're dying.
[09:43.360 --> 09:44.360]  Remembering I told you this.
[09:44.360 --> 09:45.360]  We don't stop them.
[09:45.360 --> 09:46.360]  But that's okay.
[09:46.360 --> 09:49.360]  At that point just get right with God and realize it was a satanic attack.
[09:49.360 --> 09:50.360]  What matters is your soul.
[09:50.360 --> 09:54.360]  You and your children will be vomiting up blood and bleeding out of every orifice in your body.
[09:54.360 --> 09:58.360]  But at least you'll be politically correct in trending.
[09:58.360 --> 10:05.360]  Maybe you can spend some of your money from all your anti-free speech lawsuits.
[10:05.360 --> 10:07.360]  All right.
[10:07.360 --> 10:11.360]  What I just said, I 100% know.
[10:11.360 --> 10:12.360]  I don't believe it.
[10:12.360 --> 10:14.360]  I know it.
[10:14.360 --> 10:16.360]  So let me explain something.
[10:16.360 --> 10:20.360]  I've talked about this until my jaw literally aches.
[10:20.360 --> 10:25.360]  And I've hammered it and I've shown you literally thousands of examples over the years.
[10:25.360 --> 10:27.360]  And I pulled up some examples today.
[10:27.360 --> 10:33.360]  But every major government, whether it's the British or the Australians or the Russians
[10:33.360 --> 10:39.360]  or the Chinese or the US or the South Africans or the list goes on and on.
[10:39.360 --> 10:46.360]  Along with major corporations have been creating for at least 30 years.
[10:46.360 --> 10:50.360]  Sometimes they had the ability to create synthetic DNA.
[10:50.360 --> 10:56.360]  Viruses that kill whatever amount they want.
[10:56.360 --> 11:01.360]  They could have it kill 1% like COVID or they could have it kill 90 plus percent.
[11:01.360 --> 11:05.360]  Some people are so immune, have such good health and such good vitamins and minerals.
[11:05.360 --> 11:08.360]  It happened with the rats too and the mice that it doesn't kill them.
[11:08.360 --> 11:12.360]  In fact, they don't even get infected.
[11:12.360 --> 11:16.360]  It's just like there's poisons, they spray on cockroaches and just a certain percentage are immune
[11:16.360 --> 11:19.360]  and then they have babies and they're totally immune within three generations.
[11:19.360 --> 11:21.360]  So we're tough.
[11:21.360 --> 11:23.360]  We're damn tough.
[11:23.360 --> 11:25.360]  In fact, they call us mammalian cockroaches.
[11:25.360 --> 11:30.360]  That's what the globalists call their own species if they are human.
[11:30.360 --> 11:31.360]  So we're tough.
[11:31.360 --> 11:32.360]  Our livers are tough.
[11:32.360 --> 11:33.360]  Our blood cells are tough.
[11:33.360 --> 11:34.360]  Our white blood cells are tough.
[11:34.360 --> 11:35.360]  We're tough as nails.
[11:35.360 --> 11:36.360]  We're tough.
[11:36.360 --> 11:40.360]  Especially when we know we're under attack and gear up to deal with it.
[11:40.360 --> 11:45.360]  But I've got all this huge news today but the news that broke yesterday
[11:45.360 --> 11:50.360]  and it's now all over and confirmed and they're hiding in plain view and saying what's the big deal
[11:50.360 --> 11:56.360]  is the usual suspects Fauci and Bill Gates funding it along with Peter Dazik
[11:56.360 --> 12:01.360]  at the Boston University Medical Science Center
[12:01.360 --> 12:07.360]  in the last five years created a COVID.
[12:07.360 --> 12:14.360]  Oh, isn't it funny, it's COVID that kills 80% of the humanized mice
[12:14.360 --> 12:17.360]  and these mice are animal, human, chimeras.
[12:17.360 --> 12:21.360]  They're part humans so it has the same effect on mice as it does on humans.
[12:21.360 --> 12:24.360]  It's about exactly the same.
[12:24.360 --> 12:29.360]  Gain of function Boston University creates COVID strain with 80% mortality rate
[12:29.360 --> 12:34.360]  and they're like, yeah, big deal.
[12:34.360 --> 12:42.360]  We've got a virus that kills 80% of the people that get it
[12:42.360 --> 12:46.360]  but it's for biomedical research and they get in front of Congress and say,
[12:46.360 --> 12:48.360]  no, no, no, we've never taken a virus and made it more deadly.
[12:48.360 --> 12:51.360]  The definition of gain of function.
[12:51.360 --> 12:56.360]  When there's been major scandals in the last 30 years all over the world,
[12:56.360 --> 12:59.360]  particularly the U.S., we're good scientists.
[12:59.360 --> 13:04.360]  Like in the case of 2015, should they are creating a gain of function
[13:04.360 --> 13:10.360]  SARS, chimeric virus at Chapel Hill
[13:10.360 --> 13:14.360]  that depending on the variant could kill 80% of people.
[13:14.360 --> 13:17.360]  That's what I told you because I've got all the angles here.
[13:17.360 --> 13:19.360]  They didn't release one of their really strong ones
[13:19.360 --> 13:25.360]  and it was a new virus, a chimeric, not a cold, not a flu, totally new.
[13:25.360 --> 13:27.360]  They released it, killed a bunch of people,
[13:27.360 --> 13:30.360]  blocked the therapies to protect you and then rolled out a vaccine.
[13:30.360 --> 13:34.360]  It's not a vaccine that creates the autoimmune destroying,
[13:34.360 --> 13:41.360]  blood clot creating, heart attack triggering, stroke inducing, spike protein.
[13:41.360 --> 13:45.360]  And so at the University of Texas Galveston
[13:45.360 --> 13:48.360]  and at Boston University Medical Center
[13:48.360 --> 13:53.360]  and at 46 other labs in the United States in Conus,
[13:53.360 --> 13:57.360]  continental United States, that they admit they have developed
[13:57.360 --> 14:03.360]  not just super COVID, but super mousepox that infects humans
[14:03.360 --> 14:11.360]  and wait for it, has a 99% kill rate in humanized mice.
[14:11.360 --> 14:14.360]  And apples to apples, it does the same thing to humans.
[14:14.360 --> 14:16.360]  Please explain that again.
[14:16.360 --> 14:20.360]  They got viruses that literally eat your skin off
[14:20.360 --> 14:28.360]  and kill 99% of people and they're all a bunch of leftist, transhumanist, anti-God scum.
[14:28.360 --> 14:31.360]  They're not just going to stop trying to sterilize your son
[14:31.360 --> 14:32.360]  or cut your daughter's breast off.
[14:32.360 --> 14:34.360]  They're not going to just stop shipping in fentanyl.
[14:34.360 --> 14:39.360]  They are a death cult that wants to kill you.
[14:39.360 --> 14:42.360]  Dr. Eric Bianca, the head of the biology department at UT,
[14:42.360 --> 14:43.360]  he's in my film in game.
[14:43.360 --> 14:44.360]  He was the head then.
[14:44.360 --> 14:46.360]  He came out, gave a speech and said,
[14:46.360 --> 14:51.360]  I can't wait until the airborne Ebola is released that kills 90% of humanity.
[14:51.360 --> 14:57.360]  He got a standing five, six minute ovation, the news reported.
[14:57.360 --> 15:02.360]  That's your scientist at UT in a ballroom with 2,000 people
[15:02.360 --> 15:06.360]  and the reporters were there.
[15:06.360 --> 15:07.360]  And he clarified.
[15:07.360 --> 15:09.360]  He said, yeah, I do think all of humanity should be basically wiped out.
[15:09.360 --> 15:12.360]  His students came out and said, he's a great man.
[15:12.360 --> 15:14.360]  We should kill all humans, not just 90%.
[15:14.360 --> 15:17.360]  And then I looked up the student that said that it's a former student.
[15:17.360 --> 15:24.360]  She was working in San Diego at a bio weapons lab.
[15:24.360 --> 15:28.360]  She says, Bianca's too liberal, meaning too lenient.
[15:28.360 --> 15:30.360]  We want to kill everybody.
[15:30.360 --> 15:33.360]  She said, can you not deny humanity's a parasite?
[15:33.360 --> 15:37.360]  So we're sitting here while these monsters have created things far more dangerous
[15:37.360 --> 15:42.360]  than nuclear reactors while they lecture us all day about, oh, Kanye said this
[15:42.360 --> 15:44.360]  or else you don't said that.
[15:44.360 --> 15:48.360]  While they have created this and we sit there and we let them do it.
[15:48.360 --> 15:49.360]  And here's what's scary.
[15:49.360 --> 15:51.360]  When we come back, I'm explaining the rest of the story.
[15:51.360 --> 15:54.360]  They are preparing to release it.
[15:54.360 --> 15:57.360]  So we either stop them or we die.
[15:57.360 --> 16:00.360]  We'll be right back.
[16:00.360 --> 16:06.360]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[16:06.360 --> 16:10.360]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars
[16:10.360 --> 16:15.360]  and they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people,
[16:15.360 --> 16:20.360]  not as of America, but the world for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[16:20.360 --> 16:26.360]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from info wars.com
[16:26.360 --> 16:30.360]  and to also financially support info wars.com at the most critical time on our fight

[20:26.360 --> 20:34.360]  I should add, we have Jack Nosovic, one of the smartest people I know, the greatest patriots living,
[20:34.360 --> 20:37.360]  joining us coming up next segment.
[20:37.360 --> 20:46.360]  And we have the filmmakers of The Real Anthony Fauci with Robert Kennedy Jr. coming up in the third hour today.
[20:46.360 --> 20:53.360]  Okay, so you've all seen, I would guess, it's been everywhere, the last seven hearings with Senator Paul,
[20:53.360 --> 20:58.360]  Dr. Paul saying, you did gain a function, you let a conference call gain a function,
[20:58.360 --> 21:01.360]  you let a conference promoting gain a function, you fund a gain a function,
[21:01.360 --> 21:06.360]  and Fauci lies and says, we've never done gain a function.
[21:06.360 --> 21:11.360]  And then we learn, and they don't deny it, they go, of course we made something that kills 80% of humans.
[21:11.360 --> 21:15.360]  What's the big deal?
[21:15.360 --> 21:19.360]  It's in case somebody else produces it, we'll have the cure.
[21:19.360 --> 21:25.360]  But they're the ones that cooked it up, released it, the earlier weaker version, as a beta test,
[21:25.360 --> 21:33.360]  and then gave us a poison shot that didn't protect us, and they're the ones that run depopulation foundations worldwide with the UN.
[21:33.360 --> 21:37.360]  Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate you, Bill Gates says he wants to kill you,
[21:37.360 --> 21:43.360]  Bill Gates says he wants to cut your power off, Bill Gates says he wants a new world order, Claw Schwab says it.
[21:43.360 --> 21:49.360]  And then they produce the weapons illegally to do it and laugh at us.
[21:49.360 --> 21:53.360]  And you know what, if we let them do this, I mean think of somebody that works at the FBI,
[21:53.360 --> 22:01.360]  or the Justice Department, or the media, or academia, or the intelligentsia and the clergy.
[22:01.360 --> 22:06.360]  Where are they?
[22:06.360 --> 22:14.360]  If I was a selfish person, I would be in a cabin with my family in the middle of nowhere, raising crops,
[22:14.360 --> 22:18.360]  staying away from folks around neighbors that knew what was going on.
[22:18.360 --> 22:23.360]  I would be out right now, or years ago, looking for those places.
[22:23.360 --> 22:29.360]  Because it's sure as the sun came up this morning, and it's sure as it'll set this evening,
[22:29.360 --> 22:36.360]  the new world order did their beta test and said, after we're done releasing the first virus, we'll then start cutting power off
[22:36.360 --> 22:40.360]  and having climate shutdowns, whether people like it or not, there won't be enough energy,
[22:40.360 --> 22:46.360]  and that will train them to stay put when the cyber attack comes and the powers turned off,
[22:46.360 --> 22:55.360]  and then another viral attack. They think you're so dumb, they've scripted it all publicly.
[22:55.360 --> 23:00.360]  Now, obviously, I put a big, fat target on my back exposing this, but you know what?
[23:00.360 --> 23:05.360]  I'm not going to be part of this, and so I'm going to tell everybody,
[23:05.360 --> 23:10.360]  and deep down your guts, you know this, even your sociopath.
[23:10.360 --> 23:15.360]  If you don't speak out against this, if you don't rally in protest, if you don't go to every city council
[23:15.360 --> 23:20.360]  and county commission and school board and use that pulpit to talk about this, if you don't call C-SPAN,
[23:20.360 --> 23:26.360]  if you don't rally at Congress, if you don't do whatever you've got to legally and lawfully to expose these mass murderers,
[23:26.360 --> 23:32.360]  they already drilled and set up emergency camps around the world for the next more powerful virus.
[23:32.360 --> 23:35.360]  They're not going to release one that kills 80% the next round.
[23:35.360 --> 23:41.360]  They release one that kills 1% as I said they do 20 years ago, then they beta test, they release another one that will kill 20%.
[23:41.360 --> 23:46.360]  Then people will really be scared and accept the permanent lockdown.
[23:46.360 --> 23:52.360]  Then once you're in the new permanent lockdown, once you accept that, once the combat robots are in the streets,
[23:52.360 --> 23:59.360]  once everything's controlled, once the carbon tracking is in place, once the medical ID is in place,
[23:59.360 --> 24:09.360]  within two years of that being in place, they will release multiple, because they know certain percentages are immune.
[24:09.360 --> 24:18.360]  They'll release a mouse pox that they've weaponized that kills 90% plus, they'll release a supercobra that kills 80%.
[24:18.360 --> 24:23.360]  I've said to the enemy a long time, I think they'll release three bio weapons at once that they obviously have to cure for,
[24:23.360 --> 24:25.360]  but you won't be given it.
[24:25.360 --> 24:32.360]  And they'll believe that with three bio attack setting and the media control of the beta test to have corporate media and big tech sensor,
[24:32.360 --> 24:35.360]  they'll be able to have you locked down and carry this out.
[24:35.360 --> 24:41.360]  So you've been told their plan, it's there, and I just want to ask people that get a paycheck at the media,
[24:41.360 --> 24:45.360]  or a paycheck at the Justice Department, or a paycheck wherever, where you go along with this,
[24:45.360 --> 24:50.360]  why not be like Senator Paul or DeSantis or his search in general?
[24:50.360 --> 24:52.360]  Why not be involved in self-preservation?
[24:52.360 --> 24:57.360]  The globalists say they want to kill you, they run depopulation agendas, they've been caught releasing bio weapons,
[24:57.360 --> 25:02.360]  they've been caught giving you poison shots, they've been caught lying to Congress saying they're not developing super weapons,
[25:02.360 --> 25:04.360]  and then here it is again.
[25:04.360 --> 25:06.360]  And here's my frustration.
[25:06.360 --> 25:11.360]  They've been hiding in plain view for a long time, so in case it came out, they'd say, oh, no big deal.
[25:11.360 --> 25:14.360]  Yeah, we produced a mouse pox, kills 90 plus percent.
[25:14.360 --> 25:19.360]  Yeah, we produced a cobra that kills 80 percent.
[25:19.360 --> 25:24.360]  What's the big deal?
[25:24.360 --> 25:30.360]  And China's the beta test for the martial law, so I'll announce it again in case you just tuned in.
[25:30.360 --> 25:35.360]  They've now come out getting ahead of whistleblowers that have gone public to Congress, we know behind the scenes,
[25:35.360 --> 25:42.360]  that's about to happen, come out, and said, okay, yeah, we did gain a function at Boston Medical School.
[25:42.360 --> 25:44.360]  Yeah, and it kills 80 percent of you.
[25:44.360 --> 25:47.360]  That's not 12 monkeys a movie.
[25:47.360 --> 25:52.360]  That's the real world, boys and girls.
[25:52.360 --> 25:58.360]  You think you're going to be protected because you're in the FBI, or you're a federal marshal, or you're a bureaucrat?
[25:58.360 --> 26:04.360]  The globalists are going to wipe you out along with all of us, and we're just going to shit here like we're in a cult,
[26:04.360 --> 26:08.360]  like we're in Stockholm syndrome, like we're at Jim Jones' Guiana facility,
[26:08.360 --> 26:10.360]  and we're going to drink the cyanide lace kool-aid.
[26:10.360 --> 26:14.360]  Really? Really?
[26:14.360 --> 26:17.360]  That's why they've attacked me more than anybody, because they know I'm on to them.
[26:17.360 --> 26:20.360]  I've got their number, and they want you to be inoculated psychologically,
[26:20.360 --> 26:23.360]  that when you hear something from Alex Jones, you don't listen.
[26:23.360 --> 26:26.360]  That's why they moved heaven and earth to demonize me,
[26:26.360 --> 26:29.360]  because they know what I already said is already out there, and they're going to do it.
[26:29.360 --> 26:32.360]  Even if they put me in prison or killed me, that won't work.
[26:32.360 --> 26:33.360]  It turns me into a martyr.
[26:33.360 --> 26:37.360]  They need to demonize me fully so you won't listen and stop them.
[26:37.360 --> 26:39.360]  12 monkeys, global emergency alert.
[26:39.360 --> 26:45.360]  Globalists secretly develop supercobra that kills 80 percent of those exposed at Boston Lamb.
[26:45.360 --> 26:48.360]  You might want to share that link.
[26:48.360 --> 26:49.360]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[26:49.360 --> 26:52.360]  It's in Reuters, it's in AP, but they're like, oh, it's not a big deal.
[26:52.360 --> 26:53.360]  Daily Mail got it right, though.
[26:53.360 --> 26:59.360]  Outrageous, Boston University creates COVID strain that has an 80 percent kill rate
[26:59.360 --> 27:03.360]  in mice human chimera clones.
[27:03.360 --> 27:04.360]  This is playing with fire.
[27:04.360 --> 27:06.360]  It could spark a lab-generated pandemic.
[27:06.360 --> 27:07.360]  Oh, think so?
[27:07.360 --> 27:13.360]  Experts slam Boston Lab where scientists have created a new deadly COVID strain with 80 percent kill rate.
[27:13.360 --> 27:14.360]  Bill Gates funded it.
[27:14.360 --> 27:16.360]  Peter Dazitz involved.
[27:16.360 --> 27:17.360]  Anthony Fauci.
[27:17.360 --> 27:20.360]  Always the same criminals.
[27:20.360 --> 27:24.360]  Boston University scientists were today condemned for playing with fire.
[27:24.360 --> 27:28.360]  After it emerged, they had created a lethal new COVID strain in the laboratory.
[27:28.360 --> 27:33.360]  Daily Mail revealed that the team had made the hybrid virus combined with Omicron.
[27:33.360 --> 27:34.360]  This is the newest version.
[27:34.360 --> 27:35.360]  They've been doing it for five years.
[27:35.360 --> 27:40.360]  And the original Wuhan strain that killed 80 percent of mice in the study.
[27:40.360 --> 27:43.360]  The revelation exposes a dangerous virus manipulation.
[27:43.360 --> 27:46.360]  Research continues to go on even in the U.S.
[27:46.360 --> 27:50.360]  Despite fears similar practices may have started the pandemic, may have.
[27:50.360 --> 27:51.360]  Now let's go back here.
[27:51.360 --> 27:55.360]  I remember 14 years ago making a big deal about it.
[27:55.360 --> 27:57.360]  And the headlines, I wasn't able to find it this morning.
[27:57.360 --> 27:59.360]  It was just 14 years ago, but you can look it up.
[27:59.360 --> 28:00.360]  We're going to find it.
[28:00.360 --> 28:02.360]  I said 10 minutes because I was busy.
[28:02.360 --> 28:03.360]  I spent an hour.
[28:03.360 --> 28:04.360]  I'll find it.
[28:04.360 --> 28:05.360]  The crew had no luck either.
[28:05.360 --> 28:11.360]  And the headlines in the Australian, I remember it was in the Australian when I covered it,
[28:11.360 --> 28:22.360]  it was in the Australian.au was university criticized for releasing genetic code of mouse
[28:22.360 --> 28:25.360]  pox that kills 90 plus percent.
[28:25.360 --> 28:30.360]  That was the headline.
[28:30.360 --> 28:33.360]  And they said, why would you develop this and then put the code out?
[28:33.360 --> 28:38.360]  Because now they can genetically, synthetically make things.
[28:38.360 --> 28:42.360]  And now they're giving you the ability when they release it.
[28:42.360 --> 28:44.360]  They just hit you with the beta test.
[28:44.360 --> 28:46.360]  They just hit you with a poison shot.
[28:46.360 --> 28:48.360]  And now they're gearing up for even more.
[28:48.360 --> 28:51.360]  Jack Pasoba is going to cover this in the waterfront with us.
[28:51.360 --> 28:53.360]  Straight ahead, infowars.com.
[28:53.360 --> 28:55.360]  Tomorrow's news today.

[29:00.360 --> 29:06.360]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy.
[29:06.360 --> 29:15.360]  And blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[29:15.360 --> 29:18.360]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[29:18.360 --> 29:19.360]  It's came over.
[29:19.360 --> 29:25.360]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[29:25.360 --> 29:29.360]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[29:29.360 --> 29:35.360]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infowars.com or newswars.com,

[31:11.360 --> 31:14.360]  The First Amendment is unique in the world. That's what they want to take away.
[31:14.360 --> 31:16.360]  Your ability to speak freely.
[31:16.360 --> 31:20.360]  I'm going to go for Mike Lindell next. Or they're going to go for Steve Bannon.
[31:20.360 --> 31:21.360]  Or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[31:21.360 --> 31:24.360]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years.
[31:24.360 --> 31:28.360]  And I knew they were planning all of this. And I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[31:28.360 --> 31:30.360]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[31:30.360 --> 31:33.360]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet,
[31:33.360 --> 31:37.360]  not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[31:37.360 --> 31:41.360]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful infowars has been
[31:41.360 --> 31:43.360]  because of your past support.
[31:43.360 --> 31:46.360]  Salute you and I thank you. And I ask you now. It's the critical juncture of the battle.
[31:46.360 --> 31:52.360]  Free double your efforts of visiting infowarsstore.com and getting amazing products to keep us on air.

[31:56.360 --> 31:59.360]  And I thank you all for your support.
[31:59.360 --> 32:02.360]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[32:02.360 --> 32:09.360]  When it comes to politics or culture, economics, we are always the cutting edge in the tip of the spear.
[32:09.360 --> 32:13.360]  And when we talk about the products in infowarsstore.com, they all blow you away.
[32:13.360 --> 32:17.360]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be repeat customers.
[32:17.360 --> 32:21.360]  And finally, one of our best selling products sold out for months back in stock. It's X3.
[32:21.360 --> 32:28.360]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy,
[32:28.360 --> 32:32.360]  your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[32:32.360 --> 32:41.360]  So X3, despite the fact it was running iodine, is still on sale at 50% off right now at infowarsstore.com.
[32:41.360 --> 32:44.360]  And it funds the info war, which is a 360 win.
[32:44.360 --> 32:48.360]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, it takes two weeks to kick it on average.
[32:48.360 --> 32:52.360]  You've got to go to infowarsstore.com and get X3 50% off.
[32:52.360 --> 33:03.360]  X3 50% off infowarsstore.com.
[33:22.360 --> 33:32.360]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[33:32.360 --> 33:42.360]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[33:42.360 --> 33:52.360]  Jack Pasobak's coming up to lay out the latest developments with the war in Ukraine, the economy, the midterms, 20 days out, and so much more.
[33:52.360 --> 34:00.360]  But our number one gigantic over-the-top story is the admission that Anthony Fauci and others lied to Congress about gain of function research.
[34:00.360 --> 34:03.360]  Now, secret projects, they ran with Bill Gates' funding.
[34:03.360 --> 34:14.360]  It's being reported by the Associated Press Reuters, you name it, outrage as Boston University creates COVID strain that kills 80% of humans in humanized mice, human clones.
[34:14.360 --> 34:19.360]  Absolutely insane, ladies and gentlemen. That is what's going on.
[34:19.360 --> 34:32.360]  And we were able to pull up information I talked about decades ago where they released the genetic sequencing on how to synthetically make a mousepox that kills 90% plus percent of humans.
[34:32.360 --> 34:34.360]  This is what's going on.
[34:34.360 --> 34:36.360]  And they deny they're making it in labs.
[34:36.360 --> 34:38.360]  It is more dangerous to nuclear weapons.
[34:38.360 --> 34:41.360]  It's got to be stopped right now.
[34:41.360 --> 34:43.360]  So we're going to be covering that in a moment.
[34:43.360 --> 34:47.360]  But remember, the people running this operation want global depopulation.
[34:47.360 --> 34:52.360]  That's why my book, The Great Reset in the War for the World, has been number one the last two months off and on.
[34:52.360 --> 34:54.360]  So the top 50 consecutively.
[34:54.360 --> 35:00.360]  The book is incredible, and now it's available at amazon.com on audiobook.
[35:00.360 --> 35:13.360]  And of course, you can buy signed copies of the book as a fundraiser at infowarstore.com or also buy the book there with the audio book now available on hundreds of different platforms to the chagrin of the establishment.
[35:13.360 --> 35:15.360]  Also, we've only got a few days left on this.
[35:15.360 --> 35:18.360]  We got to end the sale because a bunch of the products are about to sell out.
[35:18.360 --> 35:21.360]  Some of this stuff will continue on, but the big sale will end.
[35:21.360 --> 35:26.360]  Storewide 40% to 50% off with promo code 1776 and additional 10% off.
[35:26.360 --> 35:29.360]  That's 50% off on X3.
[35:29.360 --> 35:32.360]  That's 60% with the promo code.
[35:32.360 --> 35:34.360]  That's 60% off on vitamin mineral fusion.
[35:34.360 --> 35:37.360]  That's 60% off on DNA Force Plus.
[35:37.360 --> 35:43.360]  These are top of the line products that are on record to empower your cells, empower your immunity, and supercharge your body.
[35:43.360 --> 35:46.360]  Going into the fall and winter, it is a very smart thing to do.
[35:46.360 --> 35:58.360]  Plus, it supports the broadcast infowarstore.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine infowarstore.com or triple eight two five three three one three nine.
[35:58.360 --> 36:02.360]  So, I mentioned this earlier.
[36:02.360 --> 36:15.360]  And again, Chapel Hill, Obama, 2015, their own scientists go public and say they're weaponizing SARS to make it highly effective, transmit to humans and kill large numbers.
[36:15.360 --> 36:23.360]  Then we learned they were developing a Wuhan even called COVID-19 six months before it was released in their own codes and emails.
[36:23.360 --> 36:31.360]  They didn't use the name they were using for COVID-19 that is way way way weaker than the other strains that they've got.
[36:31.360 --> 36:43.360]  So there's all those clips of Fauci and the rest of them up there in Congress telling Senator Paul that oh no, we never did this when they have the documents, they have the records, and now it's mainstream news.
[36:43.360 --> 36:52.360]  They claim it's part of bio weapons research to treat people who've been hit by a bio weapon when these things are so incredibly specific.
[36:52.360 --> 37:01.360]  How would the Chinese or Russians or somebody create the exact virus out of billions of different combinations that supposedly they're making vaccines for?
[37:01.360 --> 37:15.360]  These are bio weapon programs disguised as bio defense, but regardless they are completely and absolutely illegal under US and international law.
[37:15.360 --> 37:16.360]  So I went over that.
[37:16.360 --> 37:21.360]  Here's some of the background news and information that I was mentioning earlier.
[37:21.360 --> 37:25.360]  Australians create deadly mouse virus.
[37:25.360 --> 37:29.360]  New York Times 2001, I said 15 years ago.
[37:29.360 --> 37:32.360]  It was 21 years ago that I remember covering this.
[37:32.360 --> 37:34.360]  Oh, it was accidental.
[37:34.360 --> 37:39.360]  They created a mouse pox that kills the vast majority of the mice.
[37:39.360 --> 37:53.360]  Biotech researchers build a more lethal mouse pox 2003, but the news was 15 years ago when the universities developed it in Australia and in New Jersey in the US.
[37:53.360 --> 38:00.360]  Released the ingredient list and how to synthetically build it.
[38:00.360 --> 38:02.360]  They released the genetic code of the world.
[38:02.360 --> 38:10.360]  Why would you release the genetic code to a bio weapon that kills over 80% of humans?
[38:10.360 --> 38:13.360]  Why would you release it for plausible deniability?
[38:13.360 --> 38:16.360]  Killer mouse pox virus raises bio terror fears.
[38:16.360 --> 38:20.360]  New York Post, London Guardian lab created killer virus by accident.
[38:20.360 --> 38:22.360]  It's an accident.
[38:22.360 --> 38:26.360]  But now they say at Boston University, it wasn't an accident.
[38:26.360 --> 38:29.360]  They get it on purpose.
[38:29.360 --> 38:37.360]  But to keep you safe, of course, while they told Congress they weren't doing it.
[38:37.360 --> 38:42.360]  Scientist research antidotes the super mouse pox virus that they created.
[38:42.360 --> 38:45.360]  It goes on and on from there.
[38:45.360 --> 38:53.360]  And now we have Jack Pasobak, who's former naval intelligence, one of the brain folks behind Trump's victory.
[38:53.360 --> 38:58.360]  And one of the most prolific people in the world now reaching millions and millions of people a day.
[38:58.360 --> 39:00.360]  I know I'm going to be on his Sunday show.
[39:00.360 --> 39:02.360]  Look forward to that.
[39:02.360 --> 39:03.360]  Wow.
[39:03.360 --> 39:05.360]  Jack, we're going to go to break here in a few minutes.
[39:05.360 --> 39:06.360]  And it's great to have you.
[39:06.360 --> 39:07.360]  Where do you want to start?
[39:07.360 --> 39:13.360]  Russia, the economy, this Boston University bombshell, the midterms.
[39:13.360 --> 39:15.360]  What do you want to hit first?
[39:15.360 --> 39:17.360]  Well, Steve, the main there, excuse me about that.
[39:17.360 --> 39:21.360]  I was going to say the main thing I want to talk about is Steve Bannon yourself.
[39:21.360 --> 39:26.360]  These show trials that we've seen the rise of show trial justice here in America.
[39:26.360 --> 39:34.360]  I mean, this is like barrier under the NKVD and his famous quote, show me the man and I will show you the crime.
[39:34.360 --> 39:36.360]  So we're seeing Steve Bannon.
[39:36.360 --> 39:38.360]  They are going to lock him up this Friday.
[39:38.360 --> 39:41.360]  Garland wants a six month sentence for him.
[39:41.360 --> 39:45.360]  They want to put him behind bars and we saw what happened to Jeffrey Epstein behind bars.
[39:45.360 --> 39:50.360]  They want him shut up for the midterms because they see what he's done.
[39:50.360 --> 39:52.360]  They see the power of the war room posse.
[39:52.360 --> 39:54.360]  They see the power of what you've done.
[39:54.360 --> 39:59.360]  That's why they've come after you and they've seen the power of other platforms out there like myself over at Human Events Daily,
[39:59.360 --> 40:02.360]  Charlie Kirk at Turning Point, Tucker, et cetera.
[40:02.360 --> 40:06.360]  They're putting all of us in the exact same boat.
[40:06.360 --> 40:07.360]  Why are they doing this?
[40:07.360 --> 40:12.360]  It's simple because they are cracking down and you said it yourself the other day.
[40:12.360 --> 40:15.360]  The propaganda would not be necessary if they were winning.
[40:15.360 --> 40:20.360]  What I would add to that, the crackdowns would not be necessary if they were winning.
[40:20.360 --> 40:25.360]  They're seeing more people than ever are now tuning into the truth
[40:25.360 --> 40:31.360]  and they are waking up to the fact that our countries have been taken over by this,
[40:31.360 --> 40:37.360]  these force of these elitist globalists, like the Davos, Klaus Schwab and his thugs,
[40:37.360 --> 40:39.360]  they came and tried to lock me up.
[40:39.360 --> 40:41.360]  They detained me at gunpoint.
[40:41.360 --> 40:45.360]  My entire crew frisked me in the front and in the back when we went over to expose them.
[40:45.360 --> 40:50.360]  We're filming this documentary series, the Great Global Reset, that we just put out the first two episodes of
[40:50.360 --> 40:54.360]  and he locks us up, they try to lock us up, they try to take our equipment,
[40:54.360 --> 40:58.360]  stubs the camera, show us the footage, try to take my guys out.
[40:58.360 --> 40:59.360]  Why is that?
[40:59.360 --> 41:00.360]  Why is that?
[41:00.360 --> 41:01.360]  I'll tell you exactly why that is.
[41:01.360 --> 41:02.360]  Not because of what we were doing.
[41:02.360 --> 41:06.360]  We were standing there filming a, you know, wearing a jacket and a pair of sunglasses
[41:06.360 --> 41:09.360]  and standing in front of a camera talking, you know, kind of like a reporter.
[41:09.360 --> 41:10.360]  It wasn't because of that.
[41:10.360 --> 41:14.360]  It's because they knew who we were and because of what we were saying
[41:14.360 --> 41:16.360]  and that we were putting a thorn in the side.
[41:16.360 --> 41:17.360]  And that's what it all is, Alex.
[41:17.360 --> 41:19.360]  That's why they're talking about censorship.
[41:19.360 --> 41:22.360]  That's why they're talking about, and you see in the new precedent, by the way,
[41:22.360 --> 41:24.360]  the new precedent that they're trying to set with you.
[41:24.360 --> 41:25.360]  They don't care about what you said.
[41:25.360 --> 41:28.360]  They only care about what they can get you on.
[41:28.360 --> 41:31.360]  So we're seeing the new precedent that's going to be applied to Kanye,
[41:31.360 --> 41:32.360]  that's going to be applied to Elon Musk.
[41:32.360 --> 41:35.360]  It's going to be applied to anyone who works in this space
[41:35.360 --> 41:39.360]  because the real point of all of this is stripping away the freedom of speech
[41:39.360 --> 41:42.360]  and the First Amendment that's enshrined in our Constitution.
[41:42.360 --> 41:46.360]  So they'll do the exact same thing, by the way, when it comes to their people.
[41:46.360 --> 41:47.360]  Just look at D.C. right now.
[41:47.360 --> 41:50.360]  Look at Washington, D.C. just this week.
[41:50.360 --> 41:54.360]  The exact same area, the D.C. jury pool, the D.C. area jury pool.
[41:54.360 --> 41:56.360]  Igor Danchenko, right?
[41:56.360 --> 42:00.360]  The guy who was the source of the fake, dirty dossier.
[42:00.360 --> 42:02.360]  Jake Tapper was out there putting it out on CNN.
[42:02.360 --> 42:05.360]  He lies to the FBI. He lies up and down.
[42:05.360 --> 42:06.360]  They let him walk.
[42:06.360 --> 42:10.360]  The very same week, they're going to frog march Steve Bannon in
[42:10.360 --> 42:14.360]  and they want to put him in chains and they want to put him behind bars.
[42:14.360 --> 42:16.360]  Why are they able to do this?
[42:16.360 --> 42:19.360]  Because the Republicans, by the way, by and large,
[42:19.360 --> 42:22.360]  have not set up a system to counteract any of it
[42:22.360 --> 42:25.360]  and because the left is moving farther and farther and farther
[42:25.360 --> 42:28.360]  because they know, by the way, that you don't believe the propaganda anymore.
[42:28.360 --> 42:29.360]  They already know.
[42:29.360 --> 42:31.360]  Okay, they already get that.
[42:31.360 --> 42:35.360]  So the only powers, Alex, that they have left is the power of fines,
[42:35.360 --> 42:40.360]  the power of levies and the cold, hard, brutal power of being able to go
[42:40.360 --> 42:44.360]  and raid a pro-life activist in front of his eight children,
[42:44.360 --> 42:48.360]  crying and screaming at seven in the morning in Bucks County, Pennsylvania.
[42:48.360 --> 42:50.360]  They'll go after you because all they have right there.
[42:50.360 --> 42:53.360]  Stay right there because I asked you what's the biggest issue and you're right.
[42:53.360 --> 42:54.360]  None of the other issues matter.
[42:54.360 --> 42:56.360]  We don't have the speech to counter.
[42:56.360 --> 42:58.360]  We'll come right back with Jack Mesovic.
[43:00.360 --> 43:04.360]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions
[43:04.360 --> 43:07.360]  be successful at silencing you.
[43:07.360 --> 43:10.360]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence Info Wars
[43:10.360 --> 43:14.360]  because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance
[43:14.360 --> 43:17.360]  alerting the people, not as of America, but the world,
[43:17.360 --> 43:21.360]  for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[43:21.360 --> 43:24.360]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever,
[43:24.360 --> 43:26.360]  to share links for InfoWars.com
[43:26.360 --> 43:29.360]  and to also financially support InfoWars.com

[43:38.360 --> 43:40.360]  They're coming for your First Amendment.
[43:40.360 --> 43:43.360]  They admit once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[43:43.360 --> 43:46.360]  I am in your hands and I'm asking for your support now
[43:46.360 --> 43:48.360]  who have my commitment to never give up or back down,
[43:48.360 --> 43:50.360]  but I could give out without your support.
[43:50.360 --> 43:52.360]  Thank you for all your past support.
[43:52.360 --> 43:54.360]  I'm encouraging you now to redouble your efforts

[44:00.360 --> 44:05.360]  By the will of God and by God working through you and your support,
[44:05.360 --> 44:10.360]  InfoWars continues to persevere against the attacks never before seen
[44:10.360 --> 44:12.360]  in the Western world against independent media.
[44:12.360 --> 44:14.360]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[44:14.360 --> 44:16.360]  And over the years, you have come to the table.
[44:16.360 --> 44:18.360]  You have stepped to the plate so many times
[44:18.360 --> 44:21.360]  and kept InfoWars and Free Speech on the air, and I thank you.
[44:21.360 --> 44:26.360]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them
[44:26.360 --> 44:27.360]  and I need your support.
[44:27.360 --> 44:30.360]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward,
[44:30.360 --> 44:33.360]  if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists,
[44:33.360 --> 44:36.360]  please visit saveinfowars.com.
[44:36.360 --> 44:40.360]  And saveinfowars.com takes you to a URL that gives him go
[44:40.360 --> 44:43.360]  for direct Alex Jones legal defense fund.
[44:43.360 --> 44:47.360]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making,
[44:47.360 --> 44:48.360]  is almost over.
[44:48.360 --> 44:50.360]  And right at the end, we're not giving up.
[44:50.360 --> 44:52.360]  We're not giving in, but we could give out.
[44:52.360 --> 44:56.360]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom
[44:56.360 --> 45:22.360]  and just in the future, go to saveinfowars.com today.
[45:27.360 --> 45:29.360]  We're having now the greatest victories
[45:29.360 --> 45:32.360]  in the fight against the new order we've ever had.
[45:32.360 --> 45:36.360]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[45:36.360 --> 45:42.360]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[45:42.360 --> 45:46.360]  and to continue in the efforts you've been tearing out and to intensify them.
[45:46.360 --> 45:47.360]  God bless you all.
[45:47.360 --> 45:48.360]  I salute you.
[45:48.360 --> 45:49.360]  I thank you.
[45:49.360 --> 45:52.360]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[45:52.360 --> 45:55.360]  because we are over the target and this dream is happening.
[45:55.360 --> 45:57.360]  The fight is my fight.
[45:57.360 --> 45:58.360]  It's your fight.
[45:58.360 --> 45:59.360]  It's our fight.
[45:59.360 --> 46:28.360]  God bless you all.
[46:29.360 --> 46:30.360]  God bless you all.
[47:00.360 --> 47:05.360]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[47:05.360 --> 47:07.360]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:19.360 --> 47:20.360]  Well, Jack Masov is prolific.
[47:20.360 --> 47:23.360]  He's got TPUSA, he does human events.
[47:23.360 --> 47:26.360]  He co-hosts with Steve Bannon, so much more, and of course dominates.
[47:26.360 --> 47:29.360]  Twitter at Jack Masovic.
[47:29.360 --> 47:33.360]  And out of all the corner copia throughout, he said,
[47:33.360 --> 47:37.360]  no one talk about censorship because if we don't have a voice with our popular true information,
[47:37.360 --> 47:38.360]  we will be crushed.
[47:38.360 --> 47:42.360]  And now the lawyer that he mentioned will play clip in a moment that works for the Democrats
[47:42.360 --> 47:45.360]  that's suing Kanye West for $200 plus million
[47:45.360 --> 47:49.360]  because Kanye quoted the coroner's report that he didn't die from a physical attack
[47:49.360 --> 47:52.360]  by the police and probably fentanyl and methamphetamine.
[47:52.360 --> 47:58.360]  Why is Kanye being singled out because he is not going along with the establishment agenda,
[47:58.360 --> 48:00.360]  whether you agree with all the statements or not.
[48:00.360 --> 48:01.360]  Yay.
[48:01.360 --> 48:05.360]  I don't agree with all of the yay statements, but he has a right to say them.
[48:05.360 --> 48:07.360]  Jack Masovic, TPUSA.com.
[48:07.360 --> 48:11.360]  I want to cover the waterfront here of the censorship of therapeutics,
[48:11.360 --> 48:14.360]  the censorship of the lockdowns, the censorship of the shots not working.
[48:14.360 --> 48:19.360]  And now Boston University with super weaponized gain of function COVID
[48:19.360 --> 48:23.360]  that kills 80% of those that come in contact with it.
[48:23.360 --> 48:24.360]  Just unbelievable.
[48:24.360 --> 48:25.360]  You got caught off.
[48:25.360 --> 48:27.360]  Please continue about where we are as a race.
[48:27.360 --> 48:29.360]  Well, I think that's exactly right.
[48:29.360 --> 48:33.360]  And these chimeric viruses that they're creating, these super viruses,
[48:33.360 --> 48:36.360]  they aren't even doing it in China anymore because the cat's out of the bag on that.
[48:36.360 --> 48:40.360]  Again, they know what they're doing.
[48:40.360 --> 48:43.360]  They know that you know what they're doing.
[48:43.360 --> 48:45.360]  They don't think you're stupid.
[48:45.360 --> 48:50.360]  They think that you won't be able to stop them, that you won't do anything about it,
[48:50.360 --> 48:53.360]  that you're just going to sit back and watch whatever comes up on Netflix,
[48:53.360 --> 48:56.360]  whatever the next streaming thing is, you're just going to swipe on Instagram,
[48:56.360 --> 48:59.360]  you're going to swipe on TikTok, they're going to suck you in.
[48:59.360 --> 49:05.360]  By the way, TikTok is actually a mind control device that was sent by the CCP
[49:05.360 --> 49:07.360]  directly affecting our children.
[49:07.360 --> 49:11.360]  It's an attack on them the same way fentanyl is attacked directly on our children.
[49:11.360 --> 49:15.360]  That's mind control, arguably in both sentences when you're talking about chemical dependency.
[49:15.360 --> 49:20.360]  But what they're doing, what they're seeing here, Alex, is a new situation
[49:20.360 --> 49:22.360]  where these viruses are coming out.
[49:22.360 --> 49:24.360]  They're doing this research.
[49:24.360 --> 49:26.360]  They claim in the name of safety.
[49:26.360 --> 49:28.360]  They claim in the name of help.
[49:28.360 --> 49:29.360]  Okay.
[49:29.360 --> 49:32.360]  Well, when this thing hits, when one of these things leaks out of the lab,
[49:32.360 --> 49:36.360]  one of these super viruses, where's the blueprint?
[49:36.360 --> 49:38.360]  Where's the on-the-shelf treatment for it?
[49:38.360 --> 49:40.360]  Where's the, oh, you just grab one of these, you'll be fine.
[49:40.360 --> 49:41.360]  Isn't that the whole point?
[49:41.360 --> 49:45.360]  That's why you were just playing the 12 Monkeys music there, as a matter of fact.
[49:45.360 --> 49:52.360]  And again, in 12 Monkeys, that's a virus that gets released at strategic points throughout the entire globe.
[49:52.360 --> 49:53.360]  Why do they have this?
[49:53.360 --> 49:54.360]  Why are they building things like this?
[49:54.360 --> 49:56.360]  They tell us it's for our safety.
[49:56.360 --> 50:00.360]  And yet it seems as though these chimeric viruses, which by the way, Alex,
[50:00.360 --> 50:06.360]  and for anybody else watching, there's been one person who's consistently talked about this for 30 years.
[50:06.360 --> 50:11.360]  And that's been Alex Jones talking about chimeric viruses, the synthesis between these.
[50:11.360 --> 50:14.360]  You covered the elite's merger.
[50:14.360 --> 50:16.360]  They call it elite capture at the beginning.
[50:16.360 --> 50:19.360]  I would call it an elite merger now with the CCP.
[50:19.360 --> 50:21.360]  You covered that, Alex, in real time.
[50:21.360 --> 50:24.360]  So I want to say to the people who want us to have a problem with saying,
[50:24.360 --> 50:26.360]  oh, well, how can you let Alex Jones on your show?
[50:26.360 --> 50:29.360]  And Alex, you and I have a big interview that's going to drop this Sunday.
[50:29.360 --> 50:32.360]  By the way, an hour-long interview, we're doing this thing.
[50:32.360 --> 50:34.360]  Alex and I pre-recorded the entire thing.
[50:34.360 --> 50:36.360]  We talk about God. We talk about faith.
[50:36.360 --> 50:39.360]  We talk about why we do what we do. We talk about advice for young men.
[50:39.360 --> 50:42.360]  We cover the waterfront, but we get into so many issues.
[50:42.360 --> 50:44.360]  This is going to be absolutely fantastic.
[50:44.360 --> 50:47.360]  It drops. The podcast drops at 10 a.m. on Human Events Daily.
[50:47.360 --> 50:50.360]  And then the video is going to go up on Real America's Voice at 6 p.m.
[50:50.360 --> 50:53.360]  We're going to broadcast it worldwide across all the streaming, all the platforms.
[50:53.360 --> 50:56.360]  Because people need to understand.
[50:56.360 --> 51:01.360]  They need to understand that you don't have to live in this world that they are creating for you.
[51:01.360 --> 51:07.360]  The end of the fourth turning, right? The end of the fourth turning.
[51:07.360 --> 51:10.360]  The end of the fourth turning, the 80-year cycle is always what?
[51:10.360 --> 51:13.360]  The creation of new institutions.
[51:13.360 --> 51:15.360]  The creation of new institutions.
[51:15.360 --> 51:17.360]  And Alex, you've got the new book out, The Great Reset,
[51:17.360 --> 51:21.360]  that explains they understand exactly what's going on.
[51:21.360 --> 51:24.360]  That's why they've tried to force the fourth turning.
[51:24.360 --> 51:28.360]  But the problem for them is, of course, there's people that don't want to go along with it.
[51:28.360 --> 51:31.360]  There's people like Putin, there's people like Xi Jinping, the Saudis,
[51:31.360 --> 51:34.360]  who are saying, you know what, we're going to call your bluff because we see what you've done.
[51:34.360 --> 51:37.360]  You've created this global empire, but we're going to break off from it.
[51:37.360 --> 51:40.360]  And then the Chinese are going to come in, they're going to take over it.
[51:40.360 --> 51:44.360]  So what people have to understand is that you can check out of all of this.
[51:44.360 --> 51:49.360]  You can check all of this by reliance on God, by working on yourself,
[51:49.360 --> 51:53.360]  by focusing on yourself, by focusing on what you yourself can control.
[51:53.360 --> 51:58.360]  And once you break free of the mind grip that they have you in,
[51:58.360 --> 52:01.360]  then you can attain true freedom.
[52:01.360 --> 52:03.360]  Jack, I really respect your analysis.
[52:03.360 --> 52:08.360]  And I just, I mean, I literally live on your Twitter and watch your show every day.
[52:08.360 --> 52:11.360]  I mean, literally, every day I watch what you're saying.
[52:11.360 --> 52:12.360]  And you were always smart.
[52:12.360 --> 52:14.360]  I've known you for about seven years.
[52:14.360 --> 52:18.360]  But you've really, I know you're a father, you got two children, you're married.
[52:18.360 --> 52:20.360]  There's something about having children that takes you next level
[52:20.360 --> 52:22.360]  because now you're really worried about them and it kicks you into high gear.
[52:22.360 --> 52:24.360]  So you were already, you know, in a really high gear.
[52:24.360 --> 52:26.360]  Now you've gone into overdrive here.
[52:26.360 --> 52:27.360]  Big picture.
[52:27.360 --> 52:31.360]  How do you think the globalists are doing versus the human populist awakening?
[52:31.360 --> 52:35.360]  How would you call this right now, say at halftime in this battle for the future
[52:35.360 --> 52:39.360]  between team renaissance, team enlightenment, team great awakening
[52:39.360 --> 52:43.360]  and team great reset, team build back better?
[52:43.360 --> 52:44.360]  Well, here's the thing, right?
[52:44.360 --> 52:47.360]  The globalists know that the jig is up.
[52:47.360 --> 52:49.360]  So they've gone full mask off.
[52:49.360 --> 52:52.360]  They'll clash Rob will go up there and say everything that he wants to say.
[52:52.360 --> 52:55.360]  He'll point out everything, you know, whatever words he has to say about Ukraine
[52:55.360 --> 52:57.360]  to get the $80 billion over there.
[52:57.360 --> 52:58.360]  You're going to eat bugs.
[52:58.360 --> 52:59.360]  You owe nothing.
[52:59.360 --> 53:00.360]  You love it.
[53:00.360 --> 53:01.360]  Yeah.
[53:01.360 --> 53:04.360]  Yeah, but they'll never talk about Taiwan because the island of Taiwan,
[53:04.360 --> 53:09.360]  that's been given as a dowry to the CCP.
[53:09.360 --> 53:13.360]  That's been given as a dowry to the CCP elites, the island of Taiwan, the free island.
[53:13.360 --> 53:14.360]  That's done.
[53:14.360 --> 53:15.360]  They don't care.
[53:15.360 --> 53:16.360]  They already gave them Hong Kong.
[53:16.360 --> 53:17.360]  They're going to give them Taiwan next.
[53:17.360 --> 53:18.360]  You know it's coming.
[53:18.360 --> 53:19.360]  That will be taken by the CCP.
[53:19.360 --> 53:22.360]  And I guarantee you, it's the West, Biden.
[53:22.360 --> 53:23.360]  They don't care.
[53:23.360 --> 53:24.360]  They're not going to fight back.
[53:24.360 --> 53:25.360]  Why?
[53:25.360 --> 53:26.360]  They're making money off of all this.
[53:26.360 --> 53:31.360]  So they're trying to get out as much as they can before the fourth turning ends,
[53:31.360 --> 53:34.360]  before the fourth turning hits on them.
[53:34.360 --> 53:35.360]  So are they winning?
[53:35.360 --> 53:36.360]  Are we winning?
[53:36.360 --> 53:38.360]  I don't think they're winning right now.
[53:38.360 --> 53:41.360]  I think they realize that it's a race.
[53:41.360 --> 53:44.360]  I would actually look at it this way as a race, right?
[53:44.360 --> 53:48.360]  Not necessarily an arms race, but a foot race to the finish line.
[53:48.360 --> 53:51.360]  Who is going to have more power at the end?
[53:51.360 --> 53:54.360]  The elites, the corrupt elites, or the people?
[53:54.360 --> 53:58.860]  If we, the people, can get our own, obviously the elected leaders, when you're looking at
[53:58.860 --> 54:02.360]  the elections, the institutional leaders, when you're talking about the institutions,
[54:02.360 --> 54:04.440]  you have to go back to basics.
[54:04.440 --> 54:09.360]  It took them 60 years to really put this in gear and they laid the plans out for this
[54:09.360 --> 54:10.800]  a hundred years.
[54:10.800 --> 54:15.400]  Go look at Huxley, and by the way, Huxley and his brother Julian Huxley, if you really
[54:15.400 --> 54:19.120]  want to understand where this all came from, go look at Crowley and all the rest of it.
[54:19.120 --> 54:22.840]  But what you need to know, what you need to know, is because there's a, when I see an
[54:22.840 --> 54:27.400]  awakening going on across Europe, when I see Italy, when I see Brazil, what's going on
[54:27.400 --> 54:29.960]  down there, and why they're trying to take out Bolsonaro so hard right now.
[54:29.960 --> 54:32.600]  He did very well in the debate this week, if everyone saw that.
[54:32.600 --> 54:35.920]  When I see what's going on in all of these other nations, you see people checking out
[54:35.920 --> 54:36.920]  of this program.
[54:36.920 --> 54:41.240]  People checking out of this agenda and saying, whoa, whoa, we didn't sign up for this.
[54:41.240 --> 54:42.520]  We don't want this.
[54:42.520 --> 54:46.720]  We don't want to be cybernetic beings with, you know, hooked up to injection feeds with
[54:46.720 --> 54:51.520]  our children getting the ever expanding vaccine schedule for them every single year.
[54:51.520 --> 54:55.400]  They're voting, by the way, tomorrow on introducing this thing and the vaccine schedule for federal
[54:55.400 --> 54:59.320]  programs for every single child that's in the program.
[54:59.320 --> 55:03.360]  There's a lot of people saying, you know what, it's been too hard too fast.
[55:03.360 --> 55:07.920]  Because Alex, it's the frog in the pot theory is what it comes down to.
[55:07.920 --> 55:11.320]  The frogs in the pot, if you turn up the water too fast, the frog jumps out.
[55:11.320 --> 55:13.920]  If you turn it on slowly, the frog never jumps.
[55:13.920 --> 55:15.200]  The frog becomes boiled, right?
[55:15.200 --> 55:16.200]  Everyone's heard that.
[55:16.200 --> 55:20.080]  But in reality, it works out a little bit differently because there's always, it's multiple frogs
[55:20.080 --> 55:23.720]  and there's always some frogs that are a little bit more sensitive to it.
[55:23.720 --> 55:27.000]  By the way, Media Matters is going to love that here I am on Info Wars talking about
[55:27.000 --> 55:28.720]  frogs with Alex Jones, right?
[55:28.720 --> 55:33.160]  And so, that one's for you guys.
[55:33.160 --> 55:37.320]  And so, there's always been some frogs, Alex, that were a little bit more sensitive to this
[55:37.320 --> 55:39.240]  and they could feel something changing.
[55:39.240 --> 55:41.480]  And they'd say, you know what, this water's getting hot.
[55:41.480 --> 55:42.480]  This water's getting hot.
[55:42.480 --> 55:43.480]  We should jump out.
[55:43.480 --> 55:44.480]  This water's getting hot.
[55:44.480 --> 55:45.480]  We should do something about it.
[55:45.480 --> 55:47.560]  And I think, Alex, that you've been one of those people.
[55:47.560 --> 55:49.600]  I think Steve Bannon's been one of those people.
[55:49.600 --> 55:53.280]  I think Donald Trump, obviously, is one of those people.
[55:53.280 --> 55:56.920]  And I think these awakenings that you're seeing, it's going to continue.
[55:56.920 --> 56:00.920]  Because everyone can see, everyone can see that the water's becoming too hot.
[56:00.920 --> 56:04.800]  They can feel the water's becoming too hot and they also made a key strategic mistake.
[56:04.800 --> 56:06.840]  And I'm going to explain what that is.
[56:06.840 --> 56:10.440]  The key strategic mistake they made was going after children.
[56:10.440 --> 56:12.640]  The sexualization of our children.
[56:12.640 --> 56:16.200]  The transing of our children that we can see going on.
[56:16.200 --> 56:17.480]  And they posted themselves on TikTok.
[56:17.480 --> 56:20.400]  Now, by the way, that's why they go after Libs at TikTok so much.
[56:20.400 --> 56:24.840]  They go after her like crazy because she's just posting what they say and brag about
[56:24.840 --> 56:27.880]  publicly that's going on.
[56:27.880 --> 56:33.960]  By going after children, you are affecting people on a very deep biological, spiritual,
[56:33.960 --> 56:38.960]  evolutionary designed soul level.
[56:38.960 --> 56:41.080]  A parent's connection with their children.
[56:41.080 --> 56:44.880]  You just mentioned it, you know, post-so before having kids to post-so after having kids.
[56:44.880 --> 56:49.480]  And it's really been watching my wife and seeing the connection that she has with our
[56:49.480 --> 56:53.920]  children, our two little boys, that I know, and as a father, you got to be there.
[56:53.920 --> 56:54.920]  You got to raise them.
[56:54.920 --> 56:55.920]  You have to teach them right.
[56:55.920 --> 56:59.240]  But there is a connection that children have with their mothers and that mothers have with
[56:59.240 --> 57:03.160]  their children from the womb, obviously, right, from that moment of conception.
[57:03.160 --> 57:08.440]  They already know that you cannot break, that nothing can break, that is more powerful than
[57:08.440 --> 57:12.440]  anything that the globalist can throw down, more powerful than any virus, more powerful
[57:12.440 --> 57:13.600]  than any vaccine.
[57:13.600 --> 57:18.720]  You will never be able to break the connection between a mother and her child because I believe
[57:18.720 --> 57:19.960]  that it is divine.
[57:19.960 --> 57:21.920]  I believe it's from divine providence.
[57:21.920 --> 57:27.300]  If you cannot sever that and if you go after it, you are making a strategic mistake that
[57:27.300 --> 57:28.800]  will be your downfall.
[57:28.800 --> 57:29.800]  I totally agree.
[57:29.800 --> 57:33.920]  I can't tell you how many former liberals over the whole trans, cut girls, breast off,
[57:33.920 --> 57:39.120]  cut boys, gendals off, has really woke people up and you're good at bringing people back
[57:39.120 --> 57:40.120]  to basics.
[57:40.120 --> 57:41.120]  We need to do this.
[57:41.120 --> 57:43.880]  Let's talk about what the fourth turning is for folks that don't know and then get into
[57:43.880 --> 57:44.880]  all of it.
[57:44.880 --> 57:51.880]  That's the Subic next hour, stay with us.
[57:51.880 --> 57:52.880]  It's our best seller.
[57:52.880 --> 57:56.920]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller, but as folks tried
[57:56.920 --> 58:01.520]  vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made
[58:01.520 --> 58:06.120]  them, it has become our number one overall best seller and it's been sold out for a while
[58:06.120 --> 58:07.960]  but it's finally back in stock.
[58:07.960 --> 58:13.440]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[58:13.440 --> 58:15.440]  function of the body.
[58:15.440 --> 58:19.240]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[58:19.240 --> 58:21.800]  need to live and be healthy.
[58:21.800 --> 58:26.200]  Essential means without these things you die and so much of the food is debased, there's
[58:26.200 --> 58:31.080]  so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with
[58:31.080 --> 58:32.080]  a product like this.
[58:32.080 --> 58:35.600]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there, but this is amongst the

[59:44.600 --> 59:57.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[59:57.600 --> 1:00:10.080]  I'm going to try to give him the floor, this is a short five minute segment, two more big
[1:00:10.080 --> 1:00:14.040]  segments coming up, but Jack for folks that don't understand, the globalists admit there
[1:00:14.040 --> 1:00:17.840]  are cycles, they know they're there, we all know they're there.
[1:00:17.840 --> 1:00:22.640]  The fourth turning's here and they want their institutions to take over from their old
[1:00:22.640 --> 1:00:27.200]  institutions collapsing, that's why right now's a critical time, you spend a few minutes
[1:00:27.200 --> 1:00:31.960]  explaining to people what Klaus Schwab is talking about when he writes a book called
[1:00:31.960 --> 1:00:33.720]  The Fourth Turning and why this is so important.
[1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:39.360]  Right, so Klaus Schwab, he plays this little game with it where he calls it the fourth
[1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:43.480]  industrial revolution, but Shraus Howe, they call it their generational theory, it's the
[1:00:43.480 --> 1:00:49.760]  fourth essentially the fourth turnings and that there are four generational turnings
[1:00:49.760 --> 1:00:52.960]  that come on within, it's pretty much 80 year cycles.
[1:00:52.960 --> 1:00:56.360]  So when you look at the 80 year cycles, you see the American Revolution, you see the
[1:00:56.360 --> 1:01:01.440]  Civil War, you see World War II and now you see the world that we're living through now,
[1:01:01.440 --> 1:01:04.400]  the 80th cycle after World War II.
[1:01:04.400 --> 1:01:06.640]  They know the great restructuring is on him.
[1:01:06.640 --> 1:01:11.400]  By the way, Putin actually kind of referenced this himself in a speech recently, he was
[1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:14.920]  talking about Ukraine, he was talking about all sorts of other things that are going on,
[1:01:14.920 --> 1:01:19.280]  by the way they're going total martial law in those four disputed territories right now
[1:01:19.280 --> 1:01:24.920]  in Ukraine, but Putin actually mentioned he said the period following World War II has
[1:01:24.920 --> 1:01:25.920]  now ended.
[1:01:25.920 --> 1:01:28.040]  He said the period following World War II, so what's he talking about?
[1:01:28.040 --> 1:01:32.280]  He's talking about that 80 year period, so people at the high levels, they understand
[1:01:32.280 --> 1:01:35.760]  what this is, they understand what we're getting into and Trump, Trump is somebody who can
[1:01:35.760 --> 1:01:40.160]  understand that energy, he can understand the energy and knows that when energy is building,
[1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:43.640]  when energy is dissipating, he understands entropy, he understands negentropy, so when
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:47.880]  energy is building or when energy is dissipating into a large system.
[1:01:47.880 --> 1:01:52.920]  This fourth turning, these systems, what comes on, you can actually see these cycles.
[1:01:52.920 --> 1:01:58.200]  Now there are memes about this, they talk about hard times and good times, essentially
[1:01:58.200 --> 1:02:05.440]  bad times create strong men, strong men create good times, good times create weak men, soft
[1:02:05.440 --> 1:02:11.880]  men, weak men create hard times again, until it's at that point, at that point in the fourth
[1:02:11.880 --> 1:02:18.760]  period, in that fourth turning, when it's time for the strong men to rise up again in
[1:02:18.760 --> 1:02:23.960]  their communities, in their cities, and I'm not talking about like Caligula or anything
[1:02:23.960 --> 1:02:29.160]  like that, what I'm talking about is the men, to actually rediscover who they are and what
[1:02:29.160 --> 1:02:34.840]  their role is in society, and why do you think you see such an attack on strong men and masculinity
[1:02:34.840 --> 1:02:39.240]  today in this country, okay, why do you see that attack, what do they attack?
[1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:43.640]  They attack police, they attack law enforcement, they attack first responders, and that goes
[1:02:43.640 --> 1:02:47.920]  right back, by the way, to this whole issue with George Floyd and the new Candace Owens
[1:02:47.920 --> 1:02:52.840]  documentary, where they point out, you know, this guy had enough fentanyl and methamphetamine
[1:02:52.840 --> 1:02:56.760]  cocktail in him to kill pretty much anybody, even a guy as big as he was, George Floyd
[1:02:56.760 --> 1:03:01.280]  was six foot four, okay, he did have hard problems, by the way, and the medical examiner
[1:03:01.280 --> 1:03:05.280]  admitted on the stand, well if we'd found him in his home with these levels in him,
[1:03:05.280 --> 1:03:12.240]  then yes, we would have given that and considered that a overdose, but what did we see?
[1:03:12.240 --> 1:03:17.360]  We saw the targeting of our police officers, one of the bed rocks of our society, one of
[1:03:17.360 --> 1:03:20.600]  the institutions, and by the way, don't get me wrong, you know, I'm the first person
[1:03:20.600 --> 1:03:24.080]  to come out here and talk about bad cops, and we have issues with cops, but I'm the
[1:03:24.080 --> 1:03:25.080]  point of view.
[1:03:25.080 --> 1:03:27.240]  Sure, but they're attacking those institutions to bully them and take them over.
[1:03:27.240 --> 1:03:30.960]  Right, they want to take over these institutions, and by the way, Al Sharpton mentioned this
[1:03:30.960 --> 1:03:35.080]  once, Al Sharpton mentioned the reason they do this, you can see the examiner's report
[1:03:35.080 --> 1:03:38.600]  is right up on hennepincounty.com, you can go look at it, I just pulled it there yesterday,
[1:03:38.600 --> 1:03:43.000]  I put some red circles on it so everyone could see, this has been on their website the entire
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:48.840]  time, no life-threatening injuries, but we did find what, fentanyl, nor fentanyl, methamphetamines.
[1:03:48.840 --> 1:03:51.560]  They want to nationalize the police force.
[1:03:51.560 --> 1:03:56.000]  This was Obama's plan, this was the original plan going all the way back to the start of
[1:03:56.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  Black Lives Matter in 2013 and 2014, okay, Ferguson with Zimmerman and everything that
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:07.840]  we saw, they've wanted to take out this police force because they don't want your municipality
[1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:11.680]  to have its own police force, and they really don't want sheriff's departments to be out
[1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:16.000]  there because the sheriff obviously is a constitutionally elected office, they don't want any of that
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:19.880]  going on, they want the federal government to achieve this so they have total control.
[1:04:19.880 --> 1:04:23.280]  So I want you to understand the predictive programming that you're looking at here, when
[1:04:23.280 --> 1:04:27.480]  you see these situations, when you look by the way, and they'll only ever show you one
[1:04:27.480 --> 1:04:33.240]  angle of Derek Chauvin's knee on the neck, they show you the angle from the stand, they
[1:04:33.240 --> 1:04:37.680]  show you the angle from the sidewalk, they never turn around and show you the other angle
[1:04:37.680 --> 1:04:42.560]  where he actually shifts his knee off of the neck and then puts it onto the back so it's
[1:04:42.560 --> 1:04:46.240]  not directly pressing the neck, they never show the other angle.
[1:04:46.240 --> 1:04:49.960]  Sure, I mean, whether Kanye's right or wrong and he's obviously right, they're suing him
[1:04:49.960 --> 1:04:54.760]  for it because of his political views, Jack Mesovic back in 60 seconds, I want to move
[1:04:54.760 --> 1:04:59.920]  into all the other big issues that are unfolding.
[1:04:59.920 --> 1:05:06.080]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[1:05:06.080 --> 1:05:11.760]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[1:05:11.760 --> 1:05:15.360]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[1:05:15.360 --> 1:05:19.800]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed, it's came over, and
[1:05:19.800 --> 1:05:24.960]  all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:30.120]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[1:05:30.120 --> 1:05:35.480]  That's why when you share articles and videos from man.video or infoworse.com or newsworse.com,
[1:05:35.480 --> 1:05:36.480]  it changes the world.
[1:05:36.480 --> 1:05:41.440]  And that's why when you go to infoworse.com and get amazing products that empower you
[1:05:41.440 --> 1:05:46.120]  and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the
[1:05:46.120 --> 1:05:48.680]  tip of the spear in the fight against the globalist.
[1:05:48.680 --> 1:05:54.880]  The fight starts at infoworse.com and the support of the fight starts at infoworse.com.
[1:05:54.880 --> 1:06:13.600]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:42.200]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:06:42.200 --> 1:06:43.720]  He said, what's front and center for you?
[1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:49.560]  You said the normalization of nuclear war, Neil's de Gries, Tyson, Sean Penn, not just
[1:06:49.560 --> 1:06:52.800]  him, government agencies, mainstream media.
[1:06:52.800 --> 1:06:56.320]  Oh, nuclear war is good for the environment, it'll lower the temperature.
[1:06:56.320 --> 1:06:58.800]  Oh, hydrogen bombs aren't radioactive.
[1:06:58.800 --> 1:07:00.120]  Yeah, they are.
[1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:03.520]  And plus they make nuclear reactors that are giant dirty bombs go off.
[1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:04.960]  What is behind that?
[1:07:04.960 --> 1:07:08.240]  Because you were enable intelligence, but that, you know, a lot of folks have been in intelligence
[1:07:08.240 --> 1:07:09.240]  groups.
[1:07:09.240 --> 1:07:11.520]  You're proven you're really smart to predict the future.
[1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:15.000]  What do you make of the Ukraine war, this normalization of nukes and how big an issue
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:18.480]  this is, the North Stream being blown up, the bridge being blown up.
[1:07:18.480 --> 1:07:20.320]  Where do you see all this going?
[1:07:20.320 --> 1:07:26.760]  Well, Alex, when I look at these articles just flying across the news desk every day,
[1:07:26.760 --> 1:07:30.280]  the same the way that when I'm doing my show prep, the same way that you do show prep,
[1:07:30.280 --> 1:07:33.680]  you're just seeing what's coming across, you know, the news and all of a sudden you're
[1:07:33.680 --> 1:07:38.280]  getting all of these articles, literally dozens, maybe hundreds at this point of articles
[1:07:38.280 --> 1:07:40.720]  every day talking about, here's what would happen.
[1:07:40.720 --> 1:07:44.520]  If a nuclear weapon hit New York City, here's what would happen if one hit Washington, D.
[1:07:44.520 --> 1:07:47.040]  C., where I live with my wife and children.
[1:07:47.040 --> 1:07:48.040]  Here's what happened.
[1:07:48.040 --> 1:07:49.040]  We don't live right downtown, by the way.
[1:07:49.040 --> 1:07:53.840]  I don't want to keep that close to the politicians.
[1:07:53.840 --> 1:07:57.520]  What we're seeing here is a very dangerous normalization.
[1:07:57.520 --> 1:08:01.240]  This idea that, well, it's just a couple of nuclear weapons because we all understood
[1:08:01.240 --> 1:08:02.600]  we've forgotten something.
[1:08:02.600 --> 1:08:05.280]  And I actually think that our elites have forgotten something over the years.
[1:08:05.280 --> 1:08:09.800]  It's like, you know, they go to skull and bones, they go into these institutions, they go into
[1:08:09.800 --> 1:08:14.200]  these secret societies, the mystery cult and everything like this.
[1:08:14.200 --> 1:08:21.560]  But the problem is, it's like they spent all their time focusing on just being corrupt.
[1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:23.200]  They don't actually run the system anymore.
[1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:26.080]  So they don't run the system, so that's why our infrastructure is falling apart, that's
[1:08:26.080 --> 1:08:29.840]  why our energy grid is falling apart, that's why buildings just fall down.
[1:08:29.840 --> 1:08:34.120]  The Kerch Bridge was attacked by a truck bomb in Crimea.
[1:08:34.120 --> 1:08:35.400]  That's how it was blown up.
[1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:39.040]  We know, obviously, that Nord Stream 2 was blown up and Nord Stream 1 is also blown up.
[1:08:39.040 --> 1:08:40.280]  We don't know who did it yet.
[1:08:40.280 --> 1:08:43.440]  I think it's kind of silly to think that the Russians would blow up their own pipeline
[1:08:43.440 --> 1:08:45.720]  in the time of war.
[1:08:45.720 --> 1:08:46.720]  I must have missed that, Captain.
[1:08:46.720 --> 1:08:49.280]  Yeah, they would blow up their own leverage over Europe.
[1:08:49.280 --> 1:08:53.640]  No, no, their leverage over Europe is sitting at the bottom of the Baltic Sea right now.
[1:08:53.640 --> 1:08:58.480]  But what I'm also seeing are these articles talking about, oh, it's tactical nukes, it's
[1:08:58.480 --> 1:09:00.160]  perfectly fine to see them.
[1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:01.160]  It might not be as bad.
[1:09:01.160 --> 1:09:02.960]  They've actually forgotten, Alex.
[1:09:02.960 --> 1:09:06.920]  They've actually forgotten the importance of the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[1:09:06.920 --> 1:09:10.440]  They've forgotten everything that we've learned through the nuclear era, and the fact that
[1:09:10.440 --> 1:09:12.760]  we didn't see nuclear weapons.
[1:09:12.760 --> 1:09:18.960]  Because there's an interesting dichotomy that comes up, because on one hand, nuclear weapons
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:21.360]  are the most powerful weapons known to man.
[1:09:21.360 --> 1:09:23.520]  You can obliterate cities with these things.
[1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:28.960]  But at the same time, they also ensure more peace because of mutually assured destruction,
[1:09:28.960 --> 1:09:33.880]  because the idea that we can take out Moscow, they can take out DC, but guess what?
[1:09:33.880 --> 1:09:37.720]  You've got our submarines out of Kings Bay, Georgia, and out of Bremerton, Washington every
[1:09:37.720 --> 1:09:38.720]  six days.
[1:09:38.720 --> 1:09:39.720]  Exactly.
[1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:42.360]  This has stopped major world wars, and there are a bunch of crazy chicken hawks, almost
[1:09:42.360 --> 1:09:46.200]  none of them have been in combat, who want to legitimize going ahead and using them when
[1:09:46.200 --> 1:09:50.000]  every scenario shows that it always escalates.
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  That's the issue.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:56.240]  It is the latter of escalation shows it almost always leads to a full-scale total commitment
[1:09:56.240 --> 1:09:57.240]  tactical nuclear war.
[1:09:57.240 --> 1:10:00.560]  Why don't you explain to folks to somebody trained by the U.S. government what that would
[1:10:00.560 --> 1:10:01.560]  look like?
[1:10:01.560 --> 1:10:07.360]  I mean, what it would look like is eventually you'd get to the point where imagine attaching
[1:10:07.360 --> 1:10:11.960]  this to one of these hypersonic glide vehicles, imagine that we can't shoot down, that they
[1:10:11.960 --> 1:10:13.120]  can't shoot down.
[1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:17.600]  Imagine attaching these to the space planes and the secret space program that we have.
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:22.560]  You would get to the point where we've got unstoppable nuclear missiles on both sides.
[1:10:22.560 --> 1:10:26.840]  What that does, it creates a situation where we've always referred to it by the acronym
[1:10:26.840 --> 1:10:29.800]  of MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction.
[1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:34.040]  It would lead us to the point that even if, by the way, if it's just rogue elements of
[1:10:34.040 --> 1:10:37.880]  the military, because that's all that's left, but if you've got one submarine that's got
[1:10:37.880 --> 1:10:41.640]  nuclear ballistic missiles on that thing, that cannot be stopped, right?
[1:10:41.640 --> 1:10:42.640]  And that's the key.
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:43.640]  Cannot be stopped.
[1:10:43.640 --> 1:10:45.880]  Whether we've got them, the North Koreans have got them, the Chinese have got them,
[1:10:45.880 --> 1:10:46.880]  all right?
[1:10:46.880 --> 1:10:51.960]  Israel's got, you know, obviously it's classified, but Israel does and has maintained a program
[1:10:51.960 --> 1:10:52.960]  over the years.
[1:10:52.960 --> 1:10:56.560]  Iran, more than likely, has a few at this point and they keep telling us, oh, they keep
[1:10:56.560 --> 1:10:57.560]  jerking our chains.
[1:10:57.560 --> 1:11:02.040]  I think it's very astute, most of the war games show that if the U.S. and Russia get
[1:11:02.040 --> 1:11:08.120]  the war even limited, suddenly Pakistan and India go to war, India and China, which most
[1:11:08.120 --> 1:11:13.680]  analysts think is actually the main threat, once you let Pandora out, it's over.
[1:11:13.680 --> 1:11:14.680]  It's completely over.
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:19.320]  And that's why, if you notice, very carefully, one of the things that Russia has to do with
[1:11:19.320 --> 1:11:25.320]  this new coalition that they're forming is a balancing act between India and China, because
[1:11:25.320 --> 1:11:30.160]  while Russia, obviously, is backstopped by both, maintains relations with both, what
[1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:35.760]  Russia has to do, though, is maintain the open relations, but at the same time, India
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:41.640]  and China hate each other and everybody knows that the only land army in all of the world
[1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:46.800]  that could stand up to the People's Liberation Army, the PRC, would be India.
[1:11:46.800 --> 1:11:52.080]  That's why the Chinese focus so much on maintaining total control over Southeast Asia, over Burma,
[1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:55.120]  focusing on Laos, et cetera, et cetera, but Vietnam, of course, hates China.
[1:11:55.120 --> 1:11:57.680]  So you've got these huge issues that are going on.
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:03.080]  And let's walk through that cashmere, the Indians just defeated the Chinese proxy army.
[1:12:03.080 --> 1:12:08.120]  So the real first battle of the World War III, is it just happening in Ukraine?
[1:12:08.120 --> 1:12:09.680]  It's really happening at cashmere.
[1:12:09.680 --> 1:12:10.680]  Right.
[1:12:10.680 --> 1:12:15.520]  The problem is, so here's the way, just to get out of the nitty gritty of it, the way
[1:12:15.520 --> 1:12:20.080]  it looks is this, do we want these to stay at the level of regional conflicts, or do
[1:12:20.080 --> 1:12:25.080]  we want these, think of the history book that's written 50 years from now, do we want this
[1:12:25.080 --> 1:12:33.240]  to be chapter one, the prologue of World War III, or do we want these to maintain their
[1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:38.880]  status as regional conflicts, India, China, Russia, Ukraine, maintain it as a regional
[1:12:38.880 --> 1:12:42.680]  conflict that's contained under containment theory, which used to be something that our
[1:12:42.680 --> 1:12:48.320]  elites would use, or do we want it to spill over into a full-on world conflict?
[1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:53.120]  And there's that great quote out there, if World War III is fought with nuclear weapons,
[1:12:53.120 --> 1:12:57.200]  then World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones, because that's all the survivors
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:12:58.200]  will have left.
[1:12:58.200 --> 1:12:59.200]  Exactly.
[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:04.120]  So why, again, our elites aren't peaceniks before, but they war-gamed it all and said
[1:13:04.120 --> 1:13:09.240]  it doesn't work any equation in life on Earth, so why have our own elites, they had a UN
[1:13:09.240 --> 1:13:12.920]  event just a year ago saying no nuclear war, our government agreed, Russia agreed, China
[1:13:12.920 --> 1:13:16.560]  agreed, suddenly now they're telling us it's good, since when did they throw all their
[1:13:16.560 --> 1:13:21.480]  own war-gaming supercomputer analysis in the trash pile?
[1:13:21.480 --> 1:13:26.080]  Well, I think this is, we're dealing with a new set of elites, one that we haven't really
[1:13:26.080 --> 1:13:31.960]  seen yet so far in American or Western history, because you see people who are so completely
[1:13:31.960 --> 1:13:36.440]  disconnected from their own countries, they view themselves as global citizens, you heard
[1:13:36.440 --> 1:13:40.800]  Barack Obama say that multiple times, that he viewed himself as a citizen of the planet,
[1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:44.840]  a citizen of the Earth, and what they really mean, Alex, is that for them, they don't care
[1:13:44.840 --> 1:13:48.040]  about what happens to the rest of us, the Hoi Ploi that's living in the cities, we're
[1:13:48.040 --> 1:13:53.880]  just insects to them, they want Elysium, they want their yachts, Jeff Bezos has his starships,
[1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:57.360]  they'll be perfectly fine in any of these scenarios, they've already got their bug-out
[1:13:57.360 --> 1:14:01.080]  shelters, they've already got their seed bunkers, they've already got all their places, their
[1:14:01.080 --> 1:14:02.080]  secret islands.
[1:14:02.080 --> 1:14:06.360]  That's right, they've already sold themselves on the idea that a nuclear war survival from
[1:14:06.360 --> 1:14:12.440]  them, when every equation shows total breakdown of society, nuclear reactors melting down everywhere,
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:13.440]  they're crazy.
[1:14:13.440 --> 1:14:17.520]  One of the questions that I've seen in one of these high-level discussions is actually
[1:14:17.520 --> 1:14:21.400]  they say, well, once we get to the point where it's all of us just living on the compound,
[1:14:21.400 --> 1:14:27.240]  living on the secret island, what do we do if the security forces decide to turn on us,
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:30.440]  because at some point they realize that we won't have any money left to be able to pay
[1:14:30.440 --> 1:14:33.640]  them, so how do we deal with the security forces?
[1:14:33.640 --> 1:14:38.000]  That's why, and they start asking these, well, can we inject things into their food?
[1:14:38.000 --> 1:14:43.060]  This is the level of pre-planning, they're already planning for a collapse, they already
[1:14:43.060 --> 1:14:47.320]  see a collapse coming, and they're planning ahead for it five years ahead, 10 years ahead,
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:48.480]  20 years ahead.
[1:14:48.480 --> 1:14:50.280]  They understand what's coming on.
[1:14:50.280 --> 1:14:52.640]  They don't care what happens to the rest of us, Alex.
[1:14:52.640 --> 1:14:57.400]  They only care about themselves, their own interests, and them being able to continue
[1:14:57.400 --> 1:14:58.400]  on.
[1:14:58.400 --> 1:15:02.160]  That's why, by the way, at the same time, they're so focused on transhumanism, and I
[1:15:02.160 --> 1:15:06.120]  love that they've got Joe Allen up in Pennsylvania covering John Fetterman as the world's first
[1:15:06.120 --> 1:15:11.320]  cyborg candidate, because by the way, they're talking about letting Fetterman use the computer
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:12.320]  during the debate.
[1:15:12.320 --> 1:15:16.440]  They're saying that, because my question with that thing is, is that thing just giving
[1:15:16.440 --> 1:15:20.560]  him the questions, or is it giving him pre-prompted answers as well?
[1:15:20.560 --> 1:15:24.400]  Is it giving him the answers to respond to, and at that point, you have to question yourself
[1:15:24.400 --> 1:15:26.680]  at what point does he end and the machine begin?
[1:15:26.680 --> 1:15:32.360]  The ultimate apotheosis that our current elites, our corrupt elites, are trying to achieve
[1:15:32.360 --> 1:15:39.000]  is full-on immortality through mind-machine merger, and John Fetterman, he's just a prototype
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:40.000]  of this.
[1:15:40.000 --> 1:15:46.040]  Deep stuff, Jack Masovic, final segment, you're absolutely right, they are trying to secure
[1:15:46.040 --> 1:15:48.800]  their future while destroying ours.
[1:15:48.800 --> 1:15:52.120]  Securing your future would be securing our collective future.
[1:15:52.120 --> 1:15:58.920]  Any aristocrat knows their power is through empowering the people of the Rebek.
[1:15:58.920 --> 1:16:04.280]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing
[1:16:04.280 --> 1:16:05.280]  you.
[1:16:05.280 --> 1:16:09.520]  And the globalist number one mission is to silence info wars, because they rightly see
[1:16:09.520 --> 1:16:14.600]  us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not as of America, but
[1:16:14.600 --> 1:16:18.800]  the world, for the threat of the globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[1:16:18.800 --> 1:16:24.800]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links from infowars.com

[1:17:59.360 --> 1:18:05.280]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be
[1:18:05.280 --> 1:18:10.640]  allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:14.480]  The First Amendment is unique in the world, that's what they want to take away, your ability
[1:18:14.480 --> 1:18:15.480]  to speak freely.
[1:18:15.480 --> 1:18:18.640]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon, or
[1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:20.160]  they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[1:18:20.160 --> 1:18:24.320]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years, and I knew they were planning
[1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:28.640]  all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere, but I couldn't have done it without
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:29.640]  your support.
[1:18:29.640 --> 1:18:32.760]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, not
[1:18:32.760 --> 1:18:37.240]  just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[1:18:37.240 --> 1:18:40.880]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been
[1:18:40.880 --> 1:18:42.560]  because of your past support.
[1:18:42.560 --> 1:18:46.360]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now, the critical juncture of the battle,
[1:18:46.360 --> 1:18:51.080]  three double your efforts of visiting infowars.com and getting amazing products that keep us on
[1:18:51.080 --> 1:18:52.080]  air.

[1:18:57.360 --> 1:18:59.200]  support.
[1:18:59.200 --> 1:19:04.360]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's
[1:19:04.360 --> 1:19:08.880]  on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to
[1:19:08.880 --> 1:19:11.520]  their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[1:19:11.520 --> 1:19:15.200]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[1:19:15.200 --> 1:19:19.920]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live and people
[1:19:19.920 --> 1:19:23.880]  don't listen and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[1:19:23.880 --> 1:19:25.960]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[1:19:25.960 --> 1:19:32.360]  I don't plan to eat Mr. Health, but if I wasn't taking products like X3 from infowars.com,
[1:19:32.360 --> 1:19:35.680]  I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[1:19:35.680 --> 1:19:40.840]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible, and despite the
[1:19:40.840 --> 1:19:47.160]  fact that selling out X3 is 50% off right now exclusively at infowars.com.
[1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:49.760]  There's a run on I&I happening right now because of the war.
[1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:50.760]  We're not selling it for that.
[1:19:50.760 --> 1:19:54.520]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.
[1:19:54.520 --> 1:20:00.320]  With X3 today, 50% off at infowars.com, all supplies last.
[1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:10.320]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:21.080]  Well, the Jack Kosovic has been laying out is absolutely the most critical information,
[1:20:21.080 --> 1:20:22.080]  period.
[1:20:22.080 --> 1:20:26.560]  In the globalists that have robbed and controlled society, consolidate power, they believe in
[1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:32.200]  a post-human world, have now set in motion something that makes them have to run to armored
[1:20:32.200 --> 1:20:39.960]  redoubts in the middle of very, very obscure, far away places.
[1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:41.120]  They've really destroyed themselves.
[1:20:41.120 --> 1:20:46.360]  They've been delusional in their greed, not building a powerful, successful world that
[1:20:46.360 --> 1:20:48.680]  creates security for all.
[1:20:48.680 --> 1:20:52.120]  They're different from past elites because anybody that knows rich people and knows their
[1:20:52.120 --> 1:20:56.880]  children, knows that their children are horrible, spoiled brats, and their kids are like psychotics.
[1:20:56.880 --> 1:21:00.760]  That's why any smart elites, what it was, British royalty, you name it, would send their young
[1:21:00.760 --> 1:21:08.440]  children to boarding schools where they got beat up and attacked and basically made to
[1:21:08.440 --> 1:21:11.920]  be tough or you'd have a worthless blob.
[1:21:11.920 --> 1:21:15.160]  Well, the last generation or so didn't do that with the elite families.
[1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:16.160]  I'm not saying that's a good thing.
[1:21:16.160 --> 1:21:20.080]  They didn't do their own kids, kind of a trauma-based mind control, but they've created totally
[1:21:20.080 --> 1:21:25.520]  disconnected individuals who run technocracies, who just want power and control and have all
[1:21:25.520 --> 1:21:31.800]  these sycophants beneath them that are yes men, and the New World Order global government
[1:21:31.800 --> 1:21:34.840]  transhumanist project is going to destroy the planet.
[1:21:34.840 --> 1:21:35.920]  It should be abandoned.
[1:21:35.920 --> 1:21:36.920]  It should be rejected.
[1:21:36.920 --> 1:21:42.360]  The gain of function, preparing all these deadly viruses, it should be rejected.
[1:21:42.360 --> 1:21:46.960]  We should collectively decide to not do it, but we're already pretty far down the path
[1:21:46.960 --> 1:21:47.960]  here.
[1:21:47.960 --> 1:21:48.960]  So we've got about eight minutes left.
[1:21:48.960 --> 1:21:53.800]  Jack Pasobic, knock it out of the park, tpusa.com, and of course, you do your great human event
[1:21:53.800 --> 1:21:54.800]  shows as well.
[1:21:54.800 --> 1:21:56.000]  It'll be premiering Sunday.
[1:21:56.000 --> 1:21:57.000]  I was on with you for an hour.
[1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:58.000]  It was great to be with you.
[1:21:58.000 --> 1:22:00.240]  In closing, I'm not going to interrupt for the next seven minutes.
[1:22:00.240 --> 1:22:02.440]  What do you want to finally impart to folks?
[1:22:02.440 --> 1:22:07.760]  Well, Alex, I would always want to impart to folks, and it's similar.
[1:22:07.760 --> 1:22:13.040]  You and I go deep on this on the Sunday special, and at human events, you'll be able to see
[1:22:13.040 --> 1:22:14.040]  it at humanevents.com.
[1:22:14.040 --> 1:22:18.280]  You'll be able to see it Sunday morning, human events daily, and then in the evening, it's
[1:22:18.280 --> 1:22:19.880]  going to air real America's voice.
[1:22:19.880 --> 1:22:24.880]  But Alex and I go deep on the question of God and the power of God in our world today.
[1:22:24.880 --> 1:22:26.960]  Because here's what the elites are trying to do.
[1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:28.320]  Here's what the great reset is all about.
[1:22:28.320 --> 1:22:29.760]  And these are current elites, by the way.
[1:22:29.760 --> 1:22:35.160]  And I'm not someone who's saying that I'm against this idea of all elites.
[1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:36.840]  I'm for a meritocracy.
[1:22:36.840 --> 1:22:41.120]  If you are the best, if you are the smartest, if you are the strongest, if you excel the
[1:22:41.120 --> 1:22:45.760]  most at your field, then yes, you should obviously be the one who's at the head of it.
[1:22:45.760 --> 1:22:47.240]  I'm for all of those things.
[1:22:47.240 --> 1:22:50.560]  I want Michelangelo to be the one who's doing the sculpting.
[1:22:50.560 --> 1:22:54.000]  I don't want someone to come up and say, oh, Michelangelo can't do it because his team
[1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.880]  doesn't have the right diversity quotient or something like that.
[1:22:56.880 --> 1:22:57.880]  That's ridiculous.
[1:22:57.880 --> 1:22:58.880]  That's what's killing us.
[1:22:58.880 --> 1:23:02.640]  By the way, to turn that into something more realistic, I want to live in a society where
[1:23:02.640 --> 1:23:07.520]  our pilots are, if I'm getting behind the seat of an airplane, my children are getting
[1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:11.840]  on an airplane, I want to know that my pilot is the best one that we could possibly find
[1:23:11.840 --> 1:23:16.360]  in the world, not just somebody who was able to pass through whatever woke filter they
[1:23:16.360 --> 1:23:18.640]  put on the entire process.
[1:23:18.640 --> 1:23:21.720]  This was the world that God designed for us.
[1:23:21.720 --> 1:23:28.720]  But what our corrupt elites are now doing is they're attempting to replace God with ourselves.
[1:23:28.720 --> 1:23:31.640]  They're trying to replace God with their own pagan cults.
[1:23:31.640 --> 1:23:35.480]  You see this, by the way, with these alphabet cults.
[1:23:35.480 --> 1:23:37.000]  You see it with the climate cults.
[1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:40.200]  You see it with so many other pagan forms of worship.
[1:23:40.200 --> 1:23:45.600]  Media Matters attacked me last week for calling the worship of Gaia a pagan cult, and it obviously
[1:23:45.600 --> 1:23:48.120]  is a pagan cult, Pachamama, et cetera.
[1:23:48.120 --> 1:23:54.000]  But also, the very next day, they went and started to desecrate one of the greatest paintings
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:56.760]  of all time by Vincent Van Gogh.
[1:23:56.760 --> 1:24:00.720]  They went and attacked this thing and said, our cult and our beliefs are more powerful
[1:24:00.720 --> 1:24:01.720]  than yours.
[1:24:01.720 --> 1:24:02.720]  And what is that?
[1:24:02.720 --> 1:24:04.360]  And here's something very interesting about that situation.
[1:24:04.360 --> 1:24:08.000]  We can laugh about them, and we can point out and make fun of them and say, oh, look
[1:24:08.000 --> 1:24:09.000]  at these crazy kids.
[1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:10.880]  But you know what they have?
[1:24:10.880 --> 1:24:14.280]  They have something that's very powerful, and we need to understand this.
[1:24:14.280 --> 1:24:16.160]  They have moral clarity.
[1:24:16.160 --> 1:24:19.520]  They have moral clarity behind their actions.
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:21.880]  They have moral clarity behind their words.
[1:24:21.880 --> 1:24:26.600]  They have moral clarity of tasks matched with purpose.
[1:24:26.600 --> 1:24:30.400]  Do we have that in Western societies today?
[1:24:30.400 --> 1:24:31.800]  Where is our moral clarity?
[1:24:31.800 --> 1:24:32.800]  Where is our moral center?
[1:24:32.800 --> 1:24:38.800]  Well, it used to come from the words of the Holy Bible, the Old Testament, the New Testament.
[1:24:38.800 --> 1:24:40.160]  I just took the family.
[1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:41.160]  We went on a trip.
[1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:42.160]  It was a turning point trip.
[1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:43.600]  It went all through the Holy Land.
[1:24:43.600 --> 1:24:45.800]  Alex, if you haven't done that, highly, highly recommend it.
[1:24:45.800 --> 1:24:46.800]  I want to do it.
[1:24:46.800 --> 1:24:47.800]  I followed your trip.
[1:24:47.800 --> 1:24:48.800]  It was amazing.
[1:24:48.800 --> 1:24:51.320]  Walk the steps of all of it, and we got into it.
[1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:54.720]  I even get into some of this stuff in the Bible that you're not supposed to look at,
[1:24:54.720 --> 1:24:55.720]  right?
[1:24:55.720 --> 1:24:59.280]  You know, some of the references to Enoch, the references to the Nephilim, the references
[1:24:59.280 --> 1:25:04.280]  to Mount Pashon, all that stuff, the giants, the fact that the book of Joshua was actually
[1:25:04.280 --> 1:25:09.000]  talking about the early Israelites fighting these remnants of the Nephilim, remnants of
[1:25:09.000 --> 1:25:10.000]  the giant clans.
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:13.000]  That's really going on in there, and so we're walking through these lands.
[1:25:13.000 --> 1:25:18.840]  But also understanding that when you go to the place where God touched down on our world
[1:25:18.840 --> 1:25:23.800]  and in our world, met with the Virgin Mary, when we went to the Rock of Golgotha and put
[1:25:23.800 --> 1:25:29.000]  your own hand on it, when you stand next to him, put your hand on the stone of unction
[1:25:29.000 --> 1:25:33.280]  that our Lord and His body lay immediately after the crucifixion before they laid him
[1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:39.640]  in the tomb, you are connected to a deep, powerful energy, and that energy is divine
[1:25:39.640 --> 1:25:40.640]  providence.
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:45.120]  And so that was what, and I believe that when our founders put this country together, they
[1:25:45.120 --> 1:25:46.320]  were relying upon that.
[1:25:46.320 --> 1:25:49.760]  You know, there's a reason that they don't talk about this very much.
[1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:54.760]  You know, our constitution isn't set up for necessarily be a moral judgment.
[1:25:54.760 --> 1:25:57.960]  There's no moral code in our constitution because they didn't need one, right?
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:00.160]  They didn't need one at the time of the founding.
[1:26:00.160 --> 1:26:03.360]  And there's also a reason, by the way, that the Bible doesn't talk about atheists because
[1:26:03.360 --> 1:26:05.800]  there were no atheists at the time of the Bible.
[1:26:05.800 --> 1:26:06.800]  Everyone believed in something.
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:10.400]  You believed in one pagan cult, or you believed in another pagan cult, or you were Jewish
[1:26:10.400 --> 1:26:11.940]  and you believed in the one true God.
[1:26:11.940 --> 1:26:17.120]  And so the situation that we find ourselves in again is that we see pagan cults everywhere.
[1:26:17.120 --> 1:26:18.520]  We see pagan worship everywhere.
[1:26:18.520 --> 1:26:20.080]  We've got Halloween coming up.
[1:26:20.080 --> 1:26:25.080]  We've seen the perversion of what's supposed to be the night of the vigil for all Saint
[1:26:25.080 --> 1:26:30.520]  State, the vigil of all Hallows, and they've perverted it into being a dark, occult practice,
[1:26:30.520 --> 1:26:31.520]  right?
[1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:32.720]  Don't practice that.
[1:26:32.720 --> 1:26:33.720]  Worship the saints.
[1:26:33.720 --> 1:26:35.640]  Worship, excuse me, don't worship the saints.
[1:26:35.640 --> 1:26:36.720]  Celebrate the saints.
[1:26:36.720 --> 1:26:37.720]  Worship God.
[1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:40.840]  We need to come back to a situation.
[1:26:40.840 --> 1:26:44.600]  We need to come back to a situation where we have that moral core and that moral clarity
[1:26:44.600 --> 1:26:50.640]  as a country because then we can then start imparting that into our institutions as we
[1:26:50.640 --> 1:26:51.640]  retake them.
[1:26:51.640 --> 1:26:59.560]  And as Markuza laid out for us, it must be a long remarch to retake our institutions
[1:26:59.560 --> 1:27:01.920]  one by one by one.
[1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:06.200]  And just like the words, the final sentence of the declaration, a firm, I was reading
[1:27:06.200 --> 1:27:10.440]  that this morning, believe it or not, a firm reliance in divine providence.
[1:27:10.440 --> 1:27:15.120]  If you do everything with a firm reliance on divine providence, you will be guided to
[1:27:15.120 --> 1:27:16.120]  truth.
[1:27:16.120 --> 1:27:19.440]  You will be guided to the promised land.
[1:27:19.440 --> 1:27:23.200]  But the people need to understand this, and Alex, you and I get into this in the special.
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:25.200]  That doesn't mean there will not be challenges.
[1:27:25.200 --> 1:27:26.880]  That does not mean your faith will not be tested.
[1:27:26.880 --> 1:27:29.720]  That does not mean that you will not be tested.
[1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:34.520]  But you must look to God and say, thank you, Lord.
[1:27:34.520 --> 1:27:37.600]  Thank you for this blessing of this challenge.
[1:27:37.600 --> 1:27:42.800]  Thank you for the blessing of this contest, this animating contest for freedom, for liberty,
[1:27:42.800 --> 1:27:47.400]  for our families and for our future that you have given us because you have given us this
[1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:48.400]  cross to bear.
[1:27:48.400 --> 1:27:49.400]  You.
[1:27:49.400 --> 1:27:52.200]  The question for us is, are we going to shoulder it?
[1:27:52.200 --> 1:27:54.960]  Are we going to shoulder it, or are we going to accept?
[1:27:54.960 --> 1:27:59.760]  Are we going to accept our lives, be transformed in what they're trying to accomplish for us
[1:27:59.760 --> 1:28:01.000]  and accept their agendas?
[1:28:01.000 --> 1:28:02.000]  I won't.
[1:28:02.000 --> 1:28:04.480]  I'll tell you right now, I'm not going to, I'm going to completely reject it.
[1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:05.480]  I'm unvaccinated.
[1:28:05.480 --> 1:28:06.480]  My family is unvaccinated.
[1:28:06.480 --> 1:28:07.480]  My children are unvaccinated.
[1:28:07.480 --> 1:28:08.480]  We've got natural immunity.
[1:28:08.480 --> 1:28:09.480]  We're perfectly fine.
[1:28:09.480 --> 1:28:13.000]  We are not going to live with their agenda, not now, not ever.
[1:28:13.000 --> 1:28:14.000]  Well, that's right.
[1:28:14.000 --> 1:28:17.520]  They say that we weren't a Christian nation, but the founder of George Washington prayed
[1:28:17.520 --> 1:28:23.360]  for hours and he wrote that he knew that God controlled battlefields, business, life, everything.
[1:28:23.360 --> 1:28:26.040]  And if you're not jacking into that, you're blind.
[1:28:26.040 --> 1:28:30.400]  We've turned off God and the devils come in like a flood in that vacuum.
[1:28:30.400 --> 1:28:31.400]  We got to get back to God.
[1:28:31.400 --> 1:28:32.640]  That's a personal relationship.
[1:28:32.640 --> 1:28:34.240]  Jack, it's so amazing having you on.
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:35.840]  Hope you'll join us again soon.
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:40.320]  TPUSA.com, humanevents.com, coming up this Sunday, we're going to drop the big interview.
[1:28:40.320 --> 1:28:41.320]  Thank you so much.
[1:28:41.320 --> 1:28:42.320]  You have a great week.
[1:28:42.320 --> 1:28:43.320]  Come up with your family.
[1:28:43.320 --> 1:28:44.320]  Alex, you as well.
[1:28:44.320 --> 1:28:45.880]  We're praying for you, Alex.
[1:28:45.880 --> 1:28:46.880]  Thank you, brother.
[1:28:46.880 --> 1:28:47.880]  All right.
[1:28:47.880 --> 1:28:48.880]  Jack Masoby.
[1:28:48.880 --> 1:28:49.880]  Amazing interview.

[1:28:54.000 --> 1:28:58.320]  tomorrow's news today.
[1:28:58.320 --> 1:29:04.480]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalist as their number one enemy.
[1:29:04.480 --> 1:29:10.160]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore that the enemies of humanity
[1:29:10.160 --> 1:29:13.760]  are obsessed with silencing us.
[1:29:13.760 --> 1:29:17.280]  They know of the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[1:29:17.280 --> 1:29:18.280]  It's game over.
[1:29:18.280 --> 1:29:23.280]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[1:29:23.280 --> 1:29:28.480]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[1:29:28.480 --> 1:29:33.840]  That's why when you share articles and videos from band.video or info wars.com or news wars.com,

[1:29:53.200 --> 1:29:58.800]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[1:29:58.800 --> 1:30:00.600]  It's our best seller.
[1:30:00.600 --> 1:30:05.280]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller, but his folks tried
[1:30:05.280 --> 1:30:09.880]  vitamin mineral fusion and experienced the way it made him feel and how healthy it made
[1:30:09.880 --> 1:30:10.880]  him.
[1:30:10.880 --> 1:30:14.640]  It has become our number one overall best seller and it's been sold out for a while, but it's
[1:30:14.640 --> 1:30:16.360]  finally back in stock.
[1:30:16.360 --> 1:30:21.800]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular
[1:30:21.800 --> 1:30:22.800]  function of the body.
[1:30:22.800 --> 1:30:27.600]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you
[1:30:27.600 --> 1:30:30.160]  need to live and be healthy.
[1:30:30.160 --> 1:30:34.160]  Essential means without these things, you die and so much of the food is debased.

[1:33:00.280 --> 1:33:26.280]  Meeting of Frontal Assault on the Lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:26.280 --> 1:33:42.320]  I'm not going to change my plan, if you can break the way and see what I say, you'll understand
[1:33:42.320 --> 1:33:53.120]  what brings life to me, I'm taking time, I'm talking about new things, I'm taking time,
[1:33:53.120 --> 1:34:01.800]  I want the American way, you better get out of the way, you say that, we reject you and
[1:34:01.800 --> 1:34:16.280]  your father the devil, free to mid and free folks, our ancestors put down the down payment
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:42.760]  and we're going to pay the rest of the bill, nobody rides for free, so much news to cover,
[1:34:42.760 --> 1:34:56.140]  so much what it is just about, we like to do it mostly because if you think understand
[1:34:56.140 --> 1:35:06.440]  that people would be proud of themselves, don't be proud of oneself, they've gotta
[1:35:06.440 --> 1:35:07.440]  know it.
[1:35:07.440 --> 1:35:12.560]  So, I want to go back to the news and the military news and the economic news and the
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:16.160]  news I haven't hit yet here in a moment.
[1:35:16.160 --> 1:35:23.100]  But here on this Wednesday, October 19 broadcast, we're going to talk about Kanye West or
[1:35:23.100 --> 1:35:28.100]  Ye.
[1:35:28.100 --> 1:35:32.880]  He comes out, he criticizes the system, those that are censoring him, they take his bank
[1:35:32.880 --> 1:35:38.400]  accounts away, they take his concerts away, and he gave a speech, I guess yesterday afternoon
[1:35:38.400 --> 1:35:43.120]  that I just saw this morning, the play at the moment, where he said, look, I'm called
[1:35:43.120 --> 1:35:45.200]  by God to do this, and he's a hundred percent real.
[1:35:45.200 --> 1:35:49.280]  People go, oh, well, he used to be part of the system and did Masonic, this and that,
[1:35:49.280 --> 1:35:50.280]  it doesn't matter.
[1:35:50.280 --> 1:35:55.360]  Most of Jesus' followers were sinners, or they were all sinners, but really bad sinners,
[1:35:55.360 --> 1:35:56.360]  they repented.
[1:35:56.360 --> 1:36:02.400]  This, this modern, parasitic view that, oh, this person didn't used to be as good as
[1:36:02.400 --> 1:36:04.640]  they are now, so we can't listen to him.
[1:36:04.640 --> 1:36:12.200]  You judge a tree by its fruits, and Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, I know it pisses your
[1:36:12.200 --> 1:36:18.920]  mom off so much when you call him Kanye West, that's a cool name, but Ye's great as well.
[1:36:18.920 --> 1:36:24.080]  He's another domino to fall, and I said this a week ago, I said, they've had this show
[1:36:24.080 --> 1:36:27.640]  trial, they've had this fake ruling on me, now the Democrat Party control lawyers are
[1:36:27.640 --> 1:36:34.280]  going to sue Dr. Carlson Kanye West, I didn't know who, and now the Democrat connected
[1:36:34.280 --> 1:36:49.800]  lawyer, big black lives matter guy, George Floyd's relation is mother of their child.
[1:36:49.800 --> 1:36:53.440]  Once two hundred plus million dollars, this Kanye ran out of a coroner's report, he had
[1:36:53.440 --> 1:36:57.040]  no physical industries, and it looked like it was probably fentanyl and methamphetamine
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:02.640]  killed him, but you're not allowed to say that because he's now a saint in anti-white
[1:37:02.640 --> 1:37:08.040]  division in this country, to break this country up.
[1:37:08.040 --> 1:37:19.520]  So here's a clip of the lawyer, Floyd's family lawyer, and he said he planned to, they've
[1:37:19.520 --> 1:37:25.440]  now filed it, a two hundred fifty million dollar lawsuit, and they bring up Alex Jones.
[1:37:25.440 --> 1:37:26.440]  Here it is.
[1:37:26.440 --> 1:37:28.720]  Let me ask you about this legal action.
[1:37:28.720 --> 1:37:35.520]  I wonder if this will mean that Kanye West comments about George Floyd will gain even
[1:37:35.520 --> 1:37:37.040]  more attention.
[1:37:37.040 --> 1:37:40.520]  Does that factor into the decision to move forward with this lawsuit?
[1:37:40.520 --> 1:37:47.240]  Well, we're going to move forward, and whether or not it receives more attention, we think
[1:37:47.240 --> 1:37:50.400]  it's a very important issue in this country.
[1:37:50.400 --> 1:37:55.400]  I mean, people are talking about free speech, but people also need to understand the limitations.
[1:37:55.400 --> 1:37:59.440]  If you're going to use other people's name for profit, if you're going to profit from
[1:37:59.440 --> 1:38:04.760]  other people's pain, if you're going to retraumatize people, then you have to pay for it, just
[1:38:04.760 --> 1:38:10.120]  like Alex Jones paid for it in the verdict against him for nearly a billion dollars.
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:16.600]  So, that's the unfair trade practices claim, where the judge found me guilty and then told
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:19.200]  the jury how guilty I was.
[1:38:19.200 --> 1:38:23.040]  They claim I questioned Sandy Hook because I made money off of it, what I questioned
[1:38:23.040 --> 1:38:24.040]  every big event.
[1:38:24.040 --> 1:38:26.120]  A lot of them are stayed, some are real.
[1:38:26.120 --> 1:38:30.360]  I questioned WMDs in Iraq, Jesse Small, I was right about those.
[1:38:30.360 --> 1:38:38.160]  But the point is, they're following that same new idea, and you know they're going to default.
[1:38:38.160 --> 1:38:40.480]  Kanye West, yay.
[1:38:40.480 --> 1:38:43.520]  You know, because they won't let them have a trial, I mean, he's a public figure.
[1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:45.600]  These people are public figures.
[1:38:45.600 --> 1:38:49.120]  The guy supposedly defamed is dead, a dead person can't supposedly sue you, but they
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:51.560]  don't care what the law says.
[1:38:51.560 --> 1:38:57.680]  But remember Kanye West donated two million for George Floyd's six-year-old daughter's
[1:38:57.680 --> 1:39:06.320]  college fund, and now the very people that he supported by about biting the hand that
[1:39:06.320 --> 1:39:10.280]  feeds you are suing him.
[1:39:10.280 --> 1:39:13.120]  And I guarantee you, when he's defaulted in front of a jury, the judge will say, you
[1:39:13.120 --> 1:39:18.120]  can't say you gave two million dollars, these people.
[1:39:18.120 --> 1:39:22.720]  See how it works?
[1:39:22.720 --> 1:39:25.960]  But hey, nobody's going to shut up, nobody's going to wait.
[1:39:25.960 --> 1:39:29.360]  This intimidation is meant, oh, they can get Kanye West, they can get Tucker Carlson, they
[1:39:29.360 --> 1:39:33.080]  can get Alex Jones, it's meant to scare off the Joe Rogan, it's meant to scare off the
[1:39:33.080 --> 1:39:35.400]  rest of the thinkers so the globalists can win.
[1:39:35.400 --> 1:39:36.760]  It's meant to scare Joe Rogan.
[1:39:36.760 --> 1:39:40.680]  This is all meant to scare Joe Rogan, and everybody like him.
[1:39:40.680 --> 1:39:42.480]  That's it, period.
[1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:46.440]  We're right on the cusp of victory.
[1:39:46.440 --> 1:39:54.880]  So here's Kanye coming out of an event, talking to a camera yesterday, here it is.
[1:39:54.880 --> 1:40:03.960]  Yay, Noriega, apologize for your George Floyd comments, how do you feel about that?
[1:40:03.960 --> 1:40:04.960]  I feel like-
[1:40:04.960 --> 1:40:05.960]  Oh, a hit pause and it started over.
[1:40:05.960 --> 1:40:10.400]  We're going to have to come back and play this, it's like four minutes long, but a show
[1:40:10.400 --> 1:40:12.920]  he's on apologizes for what he said.
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:15.040]  This is so pathetic.
[1:40:15.040 --> 1:40:20.240]  Go back to it.
[1:40:20.240 --> 1:40:27.680]  I feel like Black Lives Matter is like a warm water, it's a hot shower, and White Lives
[1:40:27.680 --> 1:40:29.600]  Matter is a closed shower.
[1:40:29.600 --> 1:40:36.120]  The funny thing about woke culture is like, woke culture is not really woke like that.
[1:40:36.120 --> 1:40:41.240]  A lot of times people, they would rather just exist inside of the paid of a lie than deal
[1:40:41.240 --> 1:40:44.080]  with the harsh realities of the truth for us to look further.
[1:40:44.080 --> 1:40:52.680]  I feel like JFK, how many documentaries there are on what happened there.
[1:40:52.680 --> 1:41:03.320]  As a people, we are a sophisticated people that have to look in and be willing to challenge
[1:41:03.320 --> 1:41:04.320]  things.
[1:41:04.320 --> 1:41:06.720]  That just take what the media has fed us.
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:12.480]  The interview we had was amazing and the exact people who sent people in the streets
[1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:18.920]  for Black Lives Matter were able to derail the interview and a lot of the ideas just
[1:41:18.920 --> 1:41:22.120]  based off the main comment.
[1:41:22.120 --> 1:41:28.480]  I'm sorry, I'm distracted by these people honking over here and stuff.
[1:41:28.480 --> 1:41:32.040]  When Nori, Nori is my brother, he's under a lot of pressure.
[1:41:32.040 --> 1:41:36.640]  If you look at the first thing it says, Nori does the interview with Rosenberg.
[1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:37.760]  What's the exact thing I was saying?
[1:41:37.760 --> 1:41:43.280]  I said the Jewish media controls so many things, it's not all the Jewish people, but there's
[1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:50.640]  specifically Jewish people in media that are in power that try to, they've bought the
[1:41:50.640 --> 1:41:54.520]  Black voice, but they haven't been able to buy my voice.
[1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:59.400]  So instead they Black bought me, they threatened people to not interview me, they threatened
[1:41:59.400 --> 1:42:03.280]  people to get away from me, they closed down my stadiums.
[1:42:03.280 --> 1:42:04.280]  Love you too, family.
[1:42:04.280 --> 1:42:05.280]  Love you too.
[1:42:05.280 --> 1:42:12.320]  You said thinking, right, appreciate you, yeah, they've done all this stuff for years
[1:42:12.320 --> 1:42:17.320]  messing with me, just like poking at me, like calling me out of my name, my name is Jay.
[1:42:17.320 --> 1:42:22.480]  Anytime they say Kanye West, I change my name, it's like Cassius Clay to Ali, you respect
[1:42:22.480 --> 1:42:27.520]  me as a man, as an American, that my name is Jay, that I have the right to choose what
[1:42:27.520 --> 1:42:28.520]  my name is.
[1:42:28.520 --> 1:42:31.280]  So when media does that, it's already disrespect.
[1:42:31.280 --> 1:42:36.480]  I love rappers, rappers are artists, but when media calls me a rapper specifically to not
[1:42:36.480 --> 1:42:40.920]  bring up the fact that I'm worth $11 billion, that I'm the richest Black man of all time,
[1:42:40.920 --> 1:42:44.360]  that I'm a billionaire, that I'm a tycoon, that I'm a visionary.
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:48.440]  And if I say that, if I say those three things, then they'll say I'm a narcissist, right?
[1:42:48.440 --> 1:42:53.600]  But they push you down so much that you got to fight just to say who you are.
[1:42:53.600 --> 1:42:54.600]  That's right.
[1:42:54.600 --> 1:42:55.600]  We're at backstage with us.
[1:42:55.600 --> 1:42:56.600]  What I got.

[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:29.080]  main base to defeat the New World Order.
[1:45:29.080 --> 1:45:34.840]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today is because the viewers and listeners
[1:45:34.840 --> 1:45:39.320]  of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[1:45:39.320 --> 1:45:42.920]  I don't take the credit, I give you the credit.

[1:45:55.600 --> 1:45:58.040]  Fund.
[1:45:58.040 --> 1:46:04.840]  I don't promote things unless they really work, but when it comes to politics or culture, economics,
[1:46:04.840 --> 1:46:07.440]  we are always the cutting edge of the tip of the spear.

[1:46:20.560 --> 1:46:27.360]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy,

[1:47:00.360 --> 1:47:06.360]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:47:06.360 --> 1:47:17.880]  I asked Bobby Dylan.
[1:47:17.880 --> 1:47:25.040]  I asked Bobby Dylan.
[1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:29.960]  I asked him a little bit, but he couldn't help me either.
[1:47:29.960 --> 1:47:30.960]  They called me the seeker.
[1:47:30.960 --> 1:47:31.960]  Didn't ask Alex Jones, did you?
[1:47:31.960 --> 1:47:32.960]  I've been searching long enough.
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:33.960]  You won't get what you're after.
[1:47:33.960 --> 1:47:40.960]  I won't get to get what I'm after till the day I die.
[1:47:40.960 --> 1:47:45.960]  It'll be born again, it'll get it all.
[1:47:45.960 --> 1:47:50.960]  People tend to hate me because I never smile.
[1:47:50.960 --> 1:47:55.960]  As I ran sat at home, they want to shake my hand.
[1:47:55.960 --> 1:48:00.960]  Focusing on nowhere, investigating miles.
[1:48:00.960 --> 1:48:07.960]  I'm a seeker, I'm a really desperate man.
[1:48:07.960 --> 1:48:20.960]  Listen to this part right here.
[1:48:20.960 --> 1:48:29.960]  Kanye West said something as he went to break that is so incredibly important.
[1:48:29.960 --> 1:48:34.960]  To get what I'm after till the day I die.
[1:48:34.960 --> 1:48:39.960]  What'd he say?
[1:48:39.960 --> 1:48:49.960]  He said, I got to fight just for people to know who I really am.
[1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:55.960]  Yeah, he's got tens of millions of dollars, top music guy in the world, arguably.
[1:48:55.960 --> 1:49:00.960]  And all he's trying to do is say who he is and the whole system comes out against him
[1:49:00.960 --> 1:49:02.960]  because if they can silence him, they can silence you.
[1:49:02.960 --> 1:49:04.960]  And that's what is bad about censorship.
[1:49:04.960 --> 1:49:07.960]  You think, oh, you're just cut off, you can't talk.
[1:49:07.960 --> 1:49:11.960]  No, that's just the beginning.
[1:49:11.960 --> 1:49:18.960]  Then they can say anything they want about you and you can't respond.
[1:49:18.960 --> 1:49:22.960]  He said, I have to fight to tell people who I really am.
[1:49:22.960 --> 1:49:25.960]  He doesn't want his identity stolen.
[1:49:25.960 --> 1:49:29.960]  So he sees Kanye West, like Prince did, as owned by Hollywood.
[1:49:29.960 --> 1:49:31.960]  So he says, I'm yay.
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:38.960]  And all he wants you to do, and I get it, he's recognized, he's an independent person,
[1:49:38.960 --> 1:49:46.960]  not owned by Hollywood, getting rid of his slave name and bringing out his real name.
[1:49:46.960 --> 1:49:48.960]  I don't care your black or white or what color you are.
[1:49:48.960 --> 1:49:55.960]  Under the new world order, the digital system and their program, you are a number, an expendable number.
[1:49:55.960 --> 1:50:01.960]  So this darling of Hollywood turns against him and they don't know what to do.
[1:50:01.960 --> 1:50:07.960]  Meanwhile, Boston University created a bio weapon that kills 80% of humans, totally illegal.
[1:50:07.960 --> 1:50:13.960]  And you don't see the ADL or Southern Primary Law Center, CNN or all these ambulance chasing lawyers
[1:50:13.960 --> 1:50:18.960]  that are suing yay and Alex Jones, you don't hear a damn word out of them.
[1:50:18.960 --> 1:50:22.960]  They don't actually care about their own kids, they're delusional, but we do.
[1:50:22.960 --> 1:50:24.960]  Here's, yay.
[1:50:24.960 --> 1:50:27.960]  I love rappers, rappers are artists.
[1:50:27.960 --> 1:50:32.960]  But when media calls me a rapper specifically to not bring up the fact that I'm worth $11 billion,
[1:50:32.960 --> 1:50:37.960]  that I'm the richest black man of all time, that I'm a billionaire, that I'm a tycoon, that I'm a visionary.
[1:50:37.960 --> 1:50:41.960]  And if I say that, if I say those three things, then they'll say I'm a narcissist.
[1:50:41.960 --> 1:50:47.960]  Right? But they push you down so much that you got to fight just to say who you are.
[1:50:47.960 --> 1:50:59.960]  You know, what I got from the documentary, from the, from the Candace Owens documentary was I felt like it was a setup.
[1:50:59.960 --> 1:51:06.960]  I felt that in the documentary, if you look at it, he told his roommates, they want a tall guy like me.
[1:51:06.960 --> 1:51:08.960]  They want a tall guy like me.
[1:51:08.960 --> 1:51:09.960]  Well, who is they?
[1:51:09.960 --> 1:51:16.960]  I'm opposed to that as a question, as opposed to, you know, giving you some kind of theory that I can't pinpoint.
[1:51:16.960 --> 1:51:25.960]  And this idea of these, these martyrs that we have, it's 14 kids that's dying in Chicago every single day.
[1:51:25.960 --> 1:51:35.960]  And they have this Jewish media, black media, trauma culture, trauma economy, the stuff that Charlemagne, the God works for,
[1:51:35.960 --> 1:51:40.960]  the stuff that Rosenberg works for, the stuff that academics, the guys, the academics.
[1:51:40.960 --> 1:51:43.960]  You got to understand all these people, the child listening to out here.
[1:51:43.960 --> 1:51:52.960]  I'm going to tell you, they're getting a checks cut, you know, and y'all, I need y'all to really respect what I'm doing,
[1:51:52.960 --> 1:51:58.960]  the stuff that I'm doing and I'm staying online and love the fact, look, I got, I got money.
[1:51:58.960 --> 1:52:00.960]  I got my songs.
[1:52:00.960 --> 1:52:03.960]  I could go off and just go to, you know, Hawaii and live a nice life.
[1:52:03.960 --> 1:52:09.960]  That means that God has called me to sacrifice all of that in order to bring the truth.
[1:52:09.960 --> 1:52:10.960]  That's what I'm saying.
[1:52:10.960 --> 1:52:11.960]  They don't cut my check.
[1:52:11.960 --> 1:52:15.960]  You listen to people that's getting, they check cut by Jewish media.
[1:52:15.960 --> 1:52:18.960]  George Soros, come and meet with me directly.
[1:52:18.960 --> 1:52:22.960]  I told you, you ain't going to send none of these people that you usually send.
[1:52:22.960 --> 1:52:24.960]  Charlemagne, we know all the names.
[1:52:24.960 --> 1:52:26.960]  Nori is a good guy.
[1:52:26.960 --> 1:52:28.960]  Like he said, he called me this morning.
[1:52:28.960 --> 1:52:31.960]  He said, maybe politics is a little bit too much for me.
[1:52:31.960 --> 1:52:33.960]  Everybody back up off of Nori.
[1:52:33.960 --> 1:52:37.960]  This is like, he was giving a platform, right?
[1:52:37.960 --> 1:52:40.960]  Which no one does.
[1:52:40.960 --> 1:52:42.960]  There's no free thought anymore.
[1:52:42.960 --> 1:52:49.960]  I give you one last bar before I, before I get on his flight.
[1:52:49.960 --> 1:52:55.960]  And for the, in order for us to evolve, we have to walk forward.
[1:52:55.960 --> 1:52:58.960]  The left leg moving forward is the idea.
[1:52:58.960 --> 1:53:02.960]  The right man, the right leg moving forward is the actualization.
[1:53:02.960 --> 1:53:05.960]  I like the word actualization better than the execution.
[1:53:05.960 --> 1:53:07.960]  We need the idea.
[1:53:07.960 --> 1:53:08.960]  We need to be realized.
[1:53:08.960 --> 1:53:09.960]  We need the idea.
[1:53:09.960 --> 1:53:11.960]  We need to be realized right now.
[1:53:11.960 --> 1:53:13.960]  The thought police have us crawling.
[1:53:13.960 --> 1:53:16.960]  We have stopped evolving.
[1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:22.960]  We have to fight for free thought to say how we feel and act upon that.
[1:53:22.960 --> 1:53:24.960]  In Jesus' name.
[1:53:24.960 --> 1:53:26.960]  Amen.
[1:53:26.960 --> 1:53:28.960]  All right.
[1:53:28.960 --> 1:53:31.960]  So what, what, what Kanye is saying is, is that the media is controlled.
[1:53:31.960 --> 1:53:34.960]  You can use whatever name you want, whatever area you want to go to.
[1:53:34.960 --> 1:53:37.960]  But they're saying he's the villain.
[1:53:37.960 --> 1:53:40.960]  Alex Jones is the villain.
[1:53:40.960 --> 1:53:44.960]  But not the people creating bio weapons that could kill all of us.
[1:53:44.960 --> 1:53:48.960]  Not the people having worldwide lockdowns and poison shots.
[1:53:48.960 --> 1:53:50.960]  And it really is a sick joke.
[1:53:50.960 --> 1:53:52.960]  So here's some of the articles.
[1:53:52.960 --> 1:53:55.960]  George Floyd's family files $250 million lawsuit.
[1:53:55.960 --> 1:53:56.960]  It's Kanye West.
[1:53:56.960 --> 1:53:58.960]  They said using the Alex Jones plan.
[1:53:58.960 --> 1:54:02.960]  Played the clip earlier.
[1:54:02.960 --> 1:54:04.960]  The matter George Floyd gave him $2 million.
[1:54:04.960 --> 1:54:07.960]  It doesn't matter Kanye West gave him $2 million.
[1:54:07.960 --> 1:54:09.960]  Adam is no good as his heart.
[1:54:09.960 --> 1:54:13.960]  Well, they want more now.
[1:54:13.960 --> 1:54:18.960]  But here is the corner report.
[1:54:18.960 --> 1:54:24.960]  No life threatening injuries, but had fentanyl and another fentanyl and methamphetamine
[1:54:24.960 --> 1:54:26.960]  and a bunch of other stuff in his body.
[1:54:26.960 --> 1:54:34.960]  And that's all Kanye West said was this medical report you see right here.
[1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:37.960]  All he did was quote, an admitted thing.
[1:54:37.960 --> 1:54:38.960]  He's not even wrong.
[1:54:38.960 --> 1:54:40.960]  He's right.
[1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:43.960]  But now they've done that to him.
[1:54:43.960 --> 1:54:45.960]  Let's play this rap song.
[1:54:45.960 --> 1:54:47.960]  Rapper defends Alex Jones and yay.
[1:54:47.960 --> 1:54:49.960]  An epic pro free speech track.
[1:54:49.960 --> 1:54:52.960]  Rapper Bryson Gray will go to break.
[1:54:52.960 --> 1:54:54.960]  A big guest coming up that made the movie.
[1:54:54.960 --> 1:54:57.960]  The real Anthony Fauci off the best selling book.
[1:54:57.960 --> 1:54:58.960]  That's all coming up.
[1:54:58.960 --> 1:55:00.960]  I've asked the crew to make a music video out of this.
[1:55:00.960 --> 1:55:01.960]  Adding images to it.
[1:55:01.960 --> 1:55:02.960]  That'll be out the next day.
[1:55:02.960 --> 1:55:04.960]  Let's go ahead and roll this.
[1:55:04.960 --> 1:55:33.960]  Let's go ahead and roll this.
[1:55:33.960 --> 1:55:35.960]  Let's go ahead and roll this.
[1:56:03.960 --> 1:56:05.960]  Let's go ahead and roll this.
[1:56:33.960 --> 1:56:35.960]  Let's go ahead and roll this.
[1:57:03.960 --> 1:57:18.960]  Let's go ahead and roll this.
[1:57:18.960 --> 1:57:20.960]  And look what they did to ya, they want everything,
[1:57:20.960 --> 1:57:23.960]  say P-Morgan, Van his the cow, but they do s-thing.
[1:57:23.960 --> 1:57:28.960]  All right, you can find Bryson Gray's viral new hip-hop song
[1:57:28.960 --> 1:57:31.960]  on InfoWars.com, Mega Rapper Defends,
[1:57:31.960 --> 1:57:34.960]  Alex Jones, Yay, and Epic Pro Free Speech Track.
[1:57:34.960 --> 1:57:37.960]  But yeah, they don't care about sex slavery or bio weapons.
[1:57:37.960 --> 1:57:39.960]  No, it's Kanye West and Alex Jones.
[1:57:39.960 --> 1:57:48.960]  It's Yay and Alex. They're the bad guys.
[1:57:48.960 --> 1:57:50.960]  It's our best seller.
[1:57:50.960 --> 1:57:52.960]  We first came out with it five years ago,
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:54.960]  and it was a moderate seller.
[1:57:54.960 --> 1:57:57.960]  But as folks tried vitamin mineral fusion and experienced
[1:57:57.960 --> 1:58:00.960]  the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them,
[1:58:00.960 --> 1:58:03.960]  it has become our number one overall best seller.
[1:58:03.960 --> 1:58:05.960]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[1:58:05.960 --> 1:58:09.960]  Vitamin mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system,
[1:58:09.960 --> 1:58:12.960]  but it helps every cellular function of the body.

[1:58:19.960 --> 1:58:21.960]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[1:58:21.960 --> 1:58:23.960]  And so much of the food is debased.
[1:58:23.960 --> 1:58:25.960]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[1:58:25.960 --> 1:58:29.960]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.

[1:59:42.960 --> 2:00:03.960]  All right, the makers of the incredible new film,
[2:00:03.960 --> 2:00:07.960]  the real Anthony Fauci that could bring down these murders
[2:00:07.960 --> 2:00:09.960]  are about to join us next segment.
[2:00:09.960 --> 2:00:11.960]  The trailer is six minutes long.
[2:00:11.960 --> 2:00:13.960]  Here's part of it, we'll post the full trailer
[2:00:13.960 --> 2:00:15.960]  at InfoWareStore.com here it is.
[2:00:15.960 --> 2:00:18.960]  Really attacking not only Dr. Anthony Fauci,
[2:00:18.960 --> 2:00:20.960]  you're attacking science.
[2:00:26.960 --> 2:00:30.960]  Science has an air of authority.
[2:00:30.960 --> 2:00:33.960]  So people who want to push back on authority
[2:00:33.960 --> 2:00:35.960]  push back on science.
[2:00:35.960 --> 2:00:40.960]  Science is about constant skepticism, constant questioning.
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:42.960]  And you didn't see any of that.
[2:00:42.960 --> 2:00:44.960]  It was a narrative.
[2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:48.960]  In a 20 month period, they obliterated all the Bill of Rights
[2:00:48.960 --> 2:00:50.960]  of the United States Constitution.
[2:00:50.960 --> 2:00:52.960]  There's no objection in the American press.
[2:00:59.960 --> 2:01:04.960]  Normalcy only returns when we largely vaccinated
[2:01:04.960 --> 2:01:07.960]  the entire global population.
[2:01:07.960 --> 2:01:09.960]  If the FDA says it's okay to take the vaccine,
[2:01:09.960 --> 2:01:10.960]  are you going to take it?
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:13.960]  I'm going to look at the data upon which the FDA makes that decision.
[2:01:16.960 --> 2:01:18.960]  They pay us hundreds of millions of dollars a year
[2:01:18.960 --> 2:01:22.960]  to hire and feed the reviewers to approve their product.
[2:01:22.960 --> 2:01:24.960]  The CDC continues to recommend that people
[2:01:24.960 --> 2:01:26.960]  who have been previously infected
[2:01:26.960 --> 2:01:28.960]  get their COVID-19 vaccine.
[2:01:28.960 --> 2:01:30.960]  CDC studies suggest getting the vaccine
[2:01:30.960 --> 2:01:33.960]  will offer you much stronger immunity to COVID
[2:01:33.960 --> 2:01:34.960]  than natural immunity.
[2:01:34.960 --> 2:01:36.960]  She's had the flu for 14 days.
[2:01:36.960 --> 2:01:37.960]  Should she get a flu shot?
[2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:39.960]  Well, no. If she got the flu for 14 days,
[2:01:39.960 --> 2:01:41.960]  she's as protected as anybody can be
[2:01:41.960 --> 2:01:44.960]  because the best vaccination is to get infected yourself.
[2:01:44.960 --> 2:01:46.960]  I've already had COVID.
[2:01:46.960 --> 2:01:47.960]  I'm protected.
[2:01:47.960 --> 2:01:49.960]  And now the study says maybe even more protected
[2:01:49.960 --> 2:01:50.960]  than the vaccine alone.
[2:01:50.960 --> 2:01:52.960]  Should they also get the vaccine?
[2:01:52.960 --> 2:01:55.960]  I don't have a really firm answer field on that.
[2:01:55.960 --> 2:01:57.960]  People who have already had the virus
[2:01:57.960 --> 2:01:59.960]  be recommended to get the vaccine as well.
[2:01:59.960 --> 2:02:01.960]  The answer is yes.
[2:02:01.960 --> 2:02:07.960]  Over 11,000 pages were released.
[2:02:07.960 --> 2:02:09.960]  The first bombshell in the document
[2:02:09.960 --> 2:02:13.960]  is that natural immunity works and Pfizer knows it.
[2:02:13.960 --> 2:02:16.960]  And there were no hospitalizations or deaths
[2:02:16.960 --> 2:02:19.960]  in the individuals who were vaccinated.
[2:02:19.960 --> 2:02:22.960]  But you now have three highly efficacious vaccines.
[2:02:22.960 --> 2:02:24.960]  There's no doubt about that.
[2:02:24.960 --> 2:02:26.960]  And there have been no hospitalizations
[2:02:26.960 --> 2:02:28.960]  or deaths in multiple countries.
[2:02:28.960 --> 2:02:31.960]  Another revelation from the documents
[2:02:31.960 --> 2:02:34.960]  was that adverse reactions were more frequent
[2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:35.960]  and more severe.
[2:02:35.960 --> 2:02:37.960]  It interestingly states some facts
[2:02:37.960 --> 2:02:39.960]  that have been labeled by the mainstream media
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:40.960]  as being misinformation.
[2:02:40.960 --> 2:02:43.960]  The consent form lists several possible side effects,
[2:02:43.960 --> 2:02:45.960]  including myocarditis.
[2:02:48.960 --> 2:02:51.960]  A new study describes how 23 service members
[2:02:51.960 --> 2:02:54.960]  later developed chest pain and sought medical attention.
[2:02:54.960 --> 2:02:59.960]  82,000 per year to 863,000 neurological issues
[2:02:59.960 --> 2:03:01.960]  which would affect our pilots.
[2:03:01.960 --> 2:03:04.960]  Over a thousand percent increase in one year.
[2:03:04.960 --> 2:03:06.960]  And it looks like in the first three months
[2:03:06.960 --> 2:03:09.960]  there was 42,000 adverse events reported
[2:03:09.960 --> 2:03:13.960]  and 1,223 deaths.
[2:03:13.960 --> 2:03:18.960]  A total of 10,262 COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections
[2:03:18.960 --> 2:03:21.960]  had been reported from 46 U.S. states.
[2:03:21.960 --> 2:03:24.960]  If you get vaccinated, you are protected.
[2:03:24.960 --> 2:03:28.960]  For every one person at the vaccine saves from COVID,
[2:03:28.960 --> 2:03:32.960]  it kills four people from fatal cardiac arrest.
[2:03:34.960 --> 2:03:38.960]  If I want the population to ultimately accept
[2:03:38.960 --> 2:03:39.960]  my digital reality,
[2:03:39.960 --> 2:03:42.960]  I have to make sure the cognitive dissonance
[2:03:42.960 --> 2:03:45.960]  is so complete that you stop trusting your own brain.
[2:03:45.960 --> 2:03:46.960]  And guess what they've done?
[2:03:46.960 --> 2:03:51.960]  Exactly that.
[2:03:54.960 --> 2:03:56.960]  The reason that only one drug has been made available,
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:03:57.960]  AZT,
[2:03:57.960 --> 2:04:00.960]  because it's the only drug that thus far has been shown
[2:04:00.960 --> 2:04:03.960]  in scientifically controlled trials to be safe and effective.
[2:04:10.960 --> 2:04:15.960]  A counter narrative that says the people who we think of
[2:04:15.960 --> 2:04:21.960]  as casualties of HIV were not actually dying from HIV.
[2:04:21.960 --> 2:04:24.960]  They were dying from unedits
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:26.960]  and that was supposedly treating HIV
[2:04:26.960 --> 2:04:28.960]  but was actually killing them.
[2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:32.960]  We can't take what's normally a decade-long process
[2:04:32.960 --> 2:04:34.960]  for developing a product
[2:04:34.960 --> 2:04:36.960]  and ensuring its safety and efficacy
[2:04:36.960 --> 2:04:39.960]  and compressing it into six to nine months
[2:04:39.960 --> 2:04:41.960]  and not cut some corners.
[2:04:41.960 --> 2:04:42.960]  That's just absurd.
[2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:45.960]  We did not fund gain-of-function research
[2:04:45.960 --> 2:04:48.960]  to be conducted in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[2:04:48.960 --> 2:04:50.960]  The preponderance of evidence now points
[2:04:50.960 --> 2:04:52.960]  towards this coming from the lab
[2:04:52.960 --> 2:04:54.960]  and what you've done is changed the definition
[2:04:54.960 --> 2:04:57.960]  on your website to try to cover your ass, basically.
[2:04:57.960 --> 2:05:00.960]  Don't let the globalist monsters
[2:05:00.960 --> 2:05:02.960]  and their mercenary minions be successful
[2:05:02.960 --> 2:05:04.960]  at silencing you.
[2:05:04.960 --> 2:05:06.960]  And the globalist's number one mission
[2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:07.960]  is to silence info wars
[2:05:07.960 --> 2:05:10.960]  because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons
[2:05:10.960 --> 2:05:12.960]  of resistance alerting the people,
[2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:14.960]  not as of America, but the world
[2:05:14.960 --> 2:05:16.960]  for the threat of the globalist
[2:05:16.960 --> 2:05:18.960]  and their censorship and tyranny.
[2:05:18.960 --> 2:05:20.960]  That's why it's so essential today,
[2:05:20.960 --> 2:05:22.960]  now more than ever, to share links
[2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:24.960]  to infowars.com
[2:05:24.960 --> 2:05:26.960]  and to also financially support infowars.com
[2:05:26.960 --> 2:05:28.960]  at the most critical time on our fight
[2:05:28.960 --> 2:05:31.960]  by using promo code 1776 at checkout
[2:05:31.960 --> 2:05:33.960]  to get additional 10% off.
[2:05:33.960 --> 2:05:35.960]  These people are coming for your birthright.
[2:05:35.960 --> 2:05:37.960]  They're coming for your First Amendment.
[2:05:37.960 --> 2:05:39.960]  They admit once they've silenced us,
[2:05:39.960 --> 2:05:41.960]  they're coming for you.
[2:05:41.960 --> 2:05:43.960]  I am in your hands and I'm asking of your support now
[2:05:43.960 --> 2:05:45.960]  who have my commitment to never give up
[2:05:45.960 --> 2:05:47.960]  or back down, but I could give out without your support.
[2:05:47.960 --> 2:05:49.960]  Thank you for all your past support
[2:05:49.960 --> 2:05:51.960]  and I'm encouraging you now to redouble your efforts
[2:05:51.960 --> 2:05:54.960]  at infowarstore.com with promo code 1776
[2:05:54.960 --> 2:05:56.960]  for an additional 10% off
[2:05:56.960 --> 2:06:10.960]  on the already big sales and huge discounts.
[2:06:26.960 --> 2:06:31.960]  It's almost always based in reality.
[2:06:31.960 --> 2:06:34.960]  Sometimes I make mistakes, but rarely.
[2:06:34.960 --> 2:06:36.960]  And I can tell you, the book,
[2:06:36.960 --> 2:06:39.960]  The Real Anthony Fauci by Robert Kennedy Jr.
[2:06:39.960 --> 2:06:44.960]  and the new film made from that book
[2:06:44.960 --> 2:06:48.960]  is potentially the most important work ever produced
[2:06:48.960 --> 2:06:52.960]  because we have the breaking news of Boston University
[2:06:52.960 --> 2:06:56.960]  with a weaponized cover that kills 80%
[2:06:56.960 --> 2:07:00.960]  of the mammals that come in contact with it.
[2:07:00.960 --> 2:07:02.960]  Total gain of function.
[2:07:02.960 --> 2:07:05.960]  We have all the news coming out
[2:07:05.960 --> 2:07:07.960]  that the vaccine isn't a vaccine that destroys your immunity,
[2:07:07.960 --> 2:07:10.960]  which we said years ago for the experts.
[2:07:10.960 --> 2:07:12.960]  And now the mass death is happening.
[2:07:12.960 --> 2:07:15.960]  Jeff Hayes and Tony Lyons and Sky Horse Publishing join us.
[2:07:15.960 --> 2:07:19.960]  JeffHayesfilms.com, The Real Anthony Fauci movie.com.
[2:07:19.960 --> 2:07:21.960]  The film drops today.
[2:07:21.960 --> 2:07:23.960]  Everybody should see it.
[2:07:23.960 --> 2:07:25.960]  I have not seen it yet.
[2:07:25.960 --> 2:07:26.960]  I'm going to watch it tonight.
[2:07:26.960 --> 2:07:28.960]  I've talked to a lot of folks that sent it to me last night
[2:07:28.960 --> 2:07:29.960]  who didn't, blew them away.
[2:07:29.960 --> 2:07:30.960]  We've seen advanced copies.
[2:07:30.960 --> 2:07:31.960]  I've seen the trailers.
[2:07:31.960 --> 2:07:32.960]  I know I've read the book.
[2:07:32.960 --> 2:07:33.960]  It's incredible.
[2:07:33.960 --> 2:07:35.960]  But they tried to censor this book
[2:07:35.960 --> 2:07:38.960]  unlike anything else except maybe the Great Reset
[2:07:38.960 --> 2:07:40.960]  and The War for the World, probably even more.
[2:07:40.960 --> 2:07:43.960]  But a film is how you really communicate information.
[2:07:43.960 --> 2:07:45.960]  So we'll go to Jeff Hayes,
[2:07:45.960 --> 2:07:48.960]  the incredible award-winning filmmaker and television producer
[2:07:48.960 --> 2:07:52.960]  about The Real Anthony Fauci movie.com
[2:07:52.960 --> 2:07:53.960]  and how people can...
[2:07:53.960 --> 2:07:55.960]  I know our listeners already know all this,
[2:07:55.960 --> 2:07:57.960]  but this is put together with documentation
[2:07:57.960 --> 2:08:00.960]  to warn others to stop the next lockdown,
[2:08:00.960 --> 2:08:02.960]  or the next release out of these labs.
[2:08:02.960 --> 2:08:04.960]  So this couldn't be a more important time for this to be coming out.
[2:08:04.960 --> 2:08:06.960]  We're not going to just go away and forget what they did
[2:08:06.960 --> 2:08:07.960]  and let them hit us again.
[2:08:07.960 --> 2:08:09.960]  Tony Lyons of Sky Horse Publishing.com,
[2:08:09.960 --> 2:08:11.960]  the founder of the most independent,
[2:08:11.960 --> 2:08:13.960]  largest, most successful independent publishing house
[2:08:13.960 --> 2:08:14.960]  in the United States.
[2:08:14.960 --> 2:08:16.960]  I salute you for all your great work.
[2:08:16.960 --> 2:08:19.960]  Again, I don't want to say this dwarfs my book.
[2:08:19.960 --> 2:08:21.960]  The Great Reset and The War for the World
[2:08:21.960 --> 2:08:23.960]  because they're complementary, but quite frankly, it does.
[2:08:23.960 --> 2:08:25.960]  Because this is the main crime
[2:08:25.960 --> 2:08:27.960]  where we have them caught dead to rights.
[2:08:27.960 --> 2:08:29.960]  So tell us about how you guys
[2:08:29.960 --> 2:08:30.960]  working with these great filmmakers
[2:08:30.960 --> 2:08:32.960]  and Robert Kennedy Jr.
[2:08:32.960 --> 2:08:34.960]  just hammered this movie out so quickly
[2:08:34.960 --> 2:08:36.960]  that according to people that have seen it,
[2:08:36.960 --> 2:08:37.960]  I haven't seen it on watching tonight,
[2:08:37.960 --> 2:08:39.960]  it's just unbelievably powerful.
[2:08:39.960 --> 2:08:42.960]  The trailers are amazing.
[2:08:42.960 --> 2:08:45.960]  So this project,
[2:08:45.960 --> 2:08:48.960]  when I read Bobby's book,
[2:08:48.960 --> 2:08:51.960]  I knew it had to be a film.
[2:08:51.960 --> 2:08:54.960]  This book, in spite of being the most suppressed
[2:08:54.960 --> 2:08:57.960]  book of my lifetime, sold a million copies
[2:08:57.960 --> 2:08:59.960]  and it's a daunting read.
[2:08:59.960 --> 2:09:02.960]  We're looking at, in my copy,
[2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:05.960]  a 600 page book.
[2:09:05.960 --> 2:09:08.960]  It was a daunting read,
[2:09:08.960 --> 2:09:12.960]  but the story was profound and compelling.
[2:09:12.960 --> 2:09:14.960]  I called Bobby and asked him
[2:09:14.960 --> 2:09:17.960]  to consider letting me make a documentary of it.
[2:09:17.960 --> 2:09:20.960]  I know they had other people calling them as well
[2:09:20.960 --> 2:09:23.960]  and fortunately for me, they agreed.
[2:09:23.960 --> 2:09:26.960]  Well, Jeff, you're a very complex filmmaker.
[2:09:26.960 --> 2:09:28.960]  I might go over all of your success,
[2:09:28.960 --> 2:09:30.960]  but it's got to be scary though,
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:32.960]  seeing the proof, the documentation while you made this.
[2:09:32.960 --> 2:09:35.960]  Tell us about the film and why it's so important.
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:38.960]  Yeah, a lot of people,
[2:09:38.960 --> 2:09:41.960]  I wasn't really familiar with Fauci's history.
[2:09:41.960 --> 2:09:44.960]  For me, he really appeared for the first time
[2:09:44.960 --> 2:09:46.960]  when he was standing next to Trump
[2:09:46.960 --> 2:09:49.960]  and here's this avuncular, grandfatherly,
[2:09:49.960 --> 2:09:51.960]  seemingly rational guy
[2:09:51.960 --> 2:09:54.960]  and I had a very positive view of him.
[2:09:54.960 --> 2:09:57.960]  Then the masks turned around, it seemed odd,
[2:09:57.960 --> 2:10:00.960]  but then when I read Bobby's book
[2:10:00.960 --> 2:10:03.960]  and saw his history,
[2:10:03.960 --> 2:10:06.960]  really 1984 was the watershed year
[2:10:06.960 --> 2:10:09.960]  when he took over the Infectious Disease Department
[2:10:09.960 --> 2:10:11.960]  at the NIH
[2:10:11.960 --> 2:10:13.960]  and took this little small,
[2:10:13.960 --> 2:10:15.960]  not really important department
[2:10:15.960 --> 2:10:18.960]  and wrestled control of the AIDS virus
[2:10:18.960 --> 2:10:21.960]  and then just did despicable things
[2:10:21.960 --> 2:10:24.960]  that cost hundreds of thousands of lives
[2:10:24.960 --> 2:10:28.960]  and watched him then take this same playbook
[2:10:28.960 --> 2:10:30.960]  right into COVID.
[2:10:30.960 --> 2:10:32.960]  I totally agree.
[2:10:32.960 --> 2:10:35.960]  So, Jeff Hayes, the filmmaker of the Real Anthony Fauci,
[2:10:35.960 --> 2:10:37.960]  if you had to describe Fauci
[2:10:37.960 --> 2:10:39.960]  in just a few words,
[2:10:39.960 --> 2:10:41.960]  Joseph Mengele 2.0,
[2:10:41.960 --> 2:10:43.960]  master criminal, I mean, when you really study him,
[2:10:43.960 --> 2:10:46.960]  it's hard to believe how much evil he's been involved in
[2:10:46.960 --> 2:10:48.960]  and what an incredible liar he is,
[2:10:48.960 --> 2:10:49.960]  like telling Congress,
[2:10:49.960 --> 2:10:51.960]  I'm not involved in gaining a function.
[2:10:51.960 --> 2:10:54.960]  He holds conferences called in support of gaining a function.
[2:10:54.960 --> 2:10:58.960]  I mean, this guy is as close to Satan as I can imagine.
[2:10:58.960 --> 2:11:00.960]  This actually has occurred before.
[2:11:00.960 --> 2:11:02.960]  There's a great example of it.
[2:11:02.960 --> 2:11:05.960]  A little bureaucrat named Harry Anzler in the 20s
[2:11:05.960 --> 2:11:08.960]  took over the Bureau of Narcotics.
[2:11:08.960 --> 2:11:10.960]  He ended up running it for 50 years.
[2:11:10.960 --> 2:11:13.960]  He created the war on drugs in the 20s
[2:11:13.960 --> 2:11:15.960]  by telling the press
[2:11:15.960 --> 2:11:18.960]  that drugs were causing black men to crave white women
[2:11:18.960 --> 2:11:21.960]  and they literally changed the caliber of bullets
[2:11:21.960 --> 2:11:24.960]  that police use based on Harry Anzler.
[2:11:24.960 --> 2:11:28.960]  And his story, you see it repeated in Fauci
[2:11:28.960 --> 2:11:31.960]  where you have a bureaucrat that takes over
[2:11:31.960 --> 2:11:33.960]  a not well-funded department
[2:11:33.960 --> 2:11:37.960]  and then suddenly gets a stunning amount of money
[2:11:37.960 --> 2:11:41.960]  and builds a power base that no one person should have.
[2:11:41.960 --> 2:11:43.960]  I want to get your take on the film
[2:11:43.960 --> 2:11:45.960]  and have people find it and get it and see it and share it.
[2:11:45.960 --> 2:11:49.960]  But undoubtedly, there's a green light for Big Pharma
[2:11:49.960 --> 2:11:51.960]  taking over our government.
[2:11:51.960 --> 2:11:54.960]  I saw you on Steve Bannon a few days ago
[2:11:54.960 --> 2:11:57.960]  and I thought you really knocked out of the park, Tony Lyons.
[2:11:57.960 --> 2:12:00.960]  Can you repeat what you said and elaborate on it?
[2:12:00.960 --> 2:12:03.960]  Yeah, so, you know, this is a book
[2:12:03.960 --> 2:12:05.960]  that was the best-selling book in America
[2:12:05.960 --> 2:12:08.960]  despite the most incredible corruption
[2:12:08.960 --> 2:12:12.960]  and censorship that's ever been waged against a book.
[2:12:12.960 --> 2:12:16.960]  So they tried to shut this book down in every conceivable way
[2:12:16.960 --> 2:12:19.960]  and they tried to do it because this book says
[2:12:19.960 --> 2:12:23.960]  that Dr. Fauci is working for Big Pharma
[2:12:23.960 --> 2:12:25.960]  at the expense of the American public
[2:12:25.960 --> 2:12:29.960]  and that hundreds of thousands of people have died unnecessarily.
[2:12:29.960 --> 2:12:32.960]  That Dr. Fauci has helped the greediest
[2:12:32.960 --> 2:12:34.960]  and most corrupt people in this country
[2:12:34.960 --> 2:12:36.960]  take over the government.
[2:12:36.960 --> 2:12:38.960]  And this is a movie that people need to watch
[2:12:38.960 --> 2:12:40.960]  and they need to make sure
[2:12:40.960 --> 2:12:43.960]  that these people cannot shut it down.
[2:12:43.960 --> 2:12:46.960]  So they did everything to shut the book down.
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:47.960]  They didn't shut it down.
[2:12:47.960 --> 2:12:48.960]  It sold a million copies,
[2:12:48.960 --> 2:12:50.960]  but I believe that it could have sold
[2:12:50.960 --> 2:12:52.960]  millions and millions of copies more
[2:12:52.960 --> 2:12:54.960]  if it wasn't shut down.
[2:12:54.960 --> 2:12:56.960]  And the movie is easier to watch,
[2:12:56.960 --> 2:13:00.960]  it's easier to understand, and it's so important.
[2:13:00.960 --> 2:13:03.960]  I don't think there's a single movie in this country
[2:13:03.960 --> 2:13:06.960]  that's more important for your viewers to watch.
[2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:08.960]  They should find it, they should share it,
[2:13:08.960 --> 2:13:10.960]  they should do whatever they can
[2:13:10.960 --> 2:13:12.960]  to encourage other people to watch it
[2:13:12.960 --> 2:13:14.960]  because this is the movie
[2:13:14.960 --> 2:13:17.960]  that shows how their country is being run.
[2:13:17.960 --> 2:13:19.960]  Tony, I totally agree with you.
[2:13:19.960 --> 2:13:21.960]  I want to get you and Jeff's take on this.
[2:13:21.960 --> 2:13:24.960]  What do you make of the beyond bombshell
[2:13:24.960 --> 2:13:28.960]  and nightmare news of super weaponized COVID
[2:13:28.960 --> 2:13:31.960]  made in just the last six months at Boston University?
[2:13:31.960 --> 2:13:32.960]  They're saying it's illegal,
[2:13:32.960 --> 2:13:33.960]  they're saying they're not doing it.
[2:13:33.960 --> 2:13:35.960]  They go, oh yeah, we have super COVID,
[2:13:35.960 --> 2:13:37.960]  kills 80% of people that come in contact with it.
[2:13:37.960 --> 2:13:39.960]  I mean, these are madmen.
[2:13:39.960 --> 2:13:42.960]  This is out of control.
[2:13:42.960 --> 2:13:45.960]  This is just insane that there would be
[2:13:45.960 --> 2:13:48.960]  gain of function research being done
[2:13:48.960 --> 2:13:51.960]  in this country now after what's just happened.
[2:13:51.960 --> 2:13:55.960]  There's no way to make gain of function research safe.
[2:13:55.960 --> 2:13:58.960]  So the idea that it's going on is even more reason
[2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:00.960]  that viewers have to watch this movie.
[2:14:00.960 --> 2:14:03.960]  They have to see what's been going on in this country
[2:14:03.960 --> 2:14:05.960]  and we all have to stop it
[2:14:05.960 --> 2:14:08.960]  and we have to make sure that their congressional hearings
[2:14:08.960 --> 2:14:12.960]  to hold Dr. Fauci and the people who he's worked closely with
[2:14:12.960 --> 2:14:15.960]  accountable for crimes against humanity.
[2:14:15.960 --> 2:14:18.960]  And there's no question that there have been crimes committed,
[2:14:18.960 --> 2:14:21.960]  that Dr. Fauci has lied repeatedly.
[2:14:21.960 --> 2:14:23.960]  And the film lays out the gain of function
[2:14:23.960 --> 2:14:25.960]  because I read the synopsis, I'm going to watch tonight.
[2:14:25.960 --> 2:14:27.960]  I'm going to come back to Jeff and you, Tony,
[2:14:27.960 --> 2:14:29.960]  but why are they so arrogant?
[2:14:29.960 --> 2:14:31.960]  I mean, once they get caught the last year doing it,
[2:14:31.960 --> 2:14:33.960]  then they launch a weaponization program
[2:14:33.960 --> 2:14:35.960]  with the most deadly virus ever known in a minute.
[2:14:35.960 --> 2:14:39.960]  I mean, what the hell is going on with these people?
[2:14:39.960 --> 2:14:44.960]  It's almost like they think they will never be held accountable.
[2:14:44.960 --> 2:14:47.960]  I literally have never seen anything like this
[2:14:47.960 --> 2:14:49.960]  when a couple of weeks ago,
[2:14:49.960 --> 2:14:53.960]  they gave EcoHealth Alliance another 3 million plus.
[2:14:53.960 --> 2:14:58.960]  This is like giving additional bullets to the person standing,
[2:14:58.960 --> 2:15:00.960]  holding the smoking gun.
[2:15:00.960 --> 2:15:03.960]  It is a really ballsy move.
[2:15:03.960 --> 2:15:05.960]  It's like delivering your five-year-old daughter
[2:15:05.960 --> 2:15:07.960]  to a convicted pedophile.
[2:15:07.960 --> 2:15:09.960]  Sure.
[2:15:09.960 --> 2:15:11.960]  I mean, what people have to realize too
[2:15:11.960 --> 2:15:14.960]  when they see what happens to this movie
[2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:17.960]  is that there are going to be people coming out calling it
[2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:20.960]  misinformation, calling it conspiracy theory,
[2:15:20.960 --> 2:15:23.960]  and what those words are is that they're just words
[2:15:23.960 --> 2:15:26.960]  to get around the fact that this is real science,
[2:15:26.960 --> 2:15:29.960]  that these are real stories and that this is the truth
[2:15:29.960 --> 2:15:32.960]  and that people have to investigate it for themselves
[2:15:32.960 --> 2:15:35.960]  because misinformation, as it's used today,
[2:15:35.960 --> 2:15:41.960]  just means any narrative that contradicts what Dr. Fauci says
[2:15:41.960 --> 2:15:43.960]  and what other government officials say.
[2:15:43.960 --> 2:15:45.960]  It doesn't mean that it's untrue.
[2:15:45.960 --> 2:15:48.960]  I agree. Stay there. Tony Lyons, CFA.
[2:15:48.960 --> 2:15:50.960]  So, look, I can answer my own question.
[2:15:50.960 --> 2:15:52.960]  They're in deep trouble. Everybody's waking up.
[2:15:52.960 --> 2:15:54.960]  They have criminal investigations in the EU.
[2:15:54.960 --> 2:15:56.960]  They're just doubling down.
[2:15:56.960 --> 2:16:00.960]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[2:16:00.960 --> 2:16:04.960]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question
[2:16:04.960 --> 2:16:07.960]  that event in any way that they deemed fit.
[2:16:07.960 --> 2:16:09.960]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[2:16:09.960 --> 2:16:12.960]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[2:16:12.960 --> 2:16:14.960]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next,
[2:16:14.960 --> 2:16:16.960]  or they're going to go for Steve Bannon,
[2:16:16.960 --> 2:16:17.960]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[2:16:17.960 --> 2:16:20.960]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but only 28 years,
[2:16:20.960 --> 2:16:22.960]  and I knew they were planning all of this,
[2:16:22.960 --> 2:16:24.960]  and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[2:16:24.960 --> 2:16:26.960]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[2:16:26.960 --> 2:16:28.960]  And now, because we've been so successful
[2:16:28.960 --> 2:16:30.960]  warning the population of the planet, not just America,
[2:16:30.960 --> 2:16:33.960]  we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[2:16:33.960 --> 2:16:36.960]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize
[2:16:36.960 --> 2:16:39.960]  how successful Info Wars has been because of your past support.
[2:16:39.960 --> 2:16:41.960]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now
[2:16:41.960 --> 2:16:43.960]  to critical juncture of the battle
[2:16:43.960 --> 2:16:46.960]  for your double your efforts of visiting infowarstore.com
[2:16:46.960 --> 2:16:49.960]  and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[2:16:49.960 --> 2:16:53.960]  1776, the promo code, the destination is infowarstore.com
[2:16:53.960 --> 2:16:56.960]  and I thank you all for your support.
[2:16:56.960 --> 2:17:00.960]  Think about a world without Info Wars.
[2:17:00.960 --> 2:17:03.960]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about
[2:17:03.960 --> 2:17:06.960]  all the incredible guests and callers and stories
[2:17:06.960 --> 2:17:10.960]  we've broken together, this family that is Info Wars.
[2:17:10.960 --> 2:17:13.960]  Think about how Info Wars is cited by Joe Rogan
[2:17:13.960 --> 2:17:17.960]  and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders
[2:17:17.960 --> 2:17:21.960]  like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus
[2:17:21.960 --> 2:17:26.960]  towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[2:17:26.960 --> 2:17:30.960]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:33.960]  is because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast
[2:17:33.960 --> 2:17:36.960]  have taken action and supported this show.
[2:17:36.960 --> 2:17:38.960]  I don't take the credit.
[2:17:38.960 --> 2:17:40.960]  I give you the credit.
[2:17:40.960 --> 2:17:43.960]  And now Info Wars is facing its darkest hours.
[2:17:43.960 --> 2:17:44.960]  It isn't going to give up.
[2:17:44.960 --> 2:17:46.960]  Without your support, we can be shut down.
[2:17:46.960 --> 2:17:49.960]  Please go to saveinfowars.com today.
[2:17:49.960 --> 2:17:55.960]  Saveinfowars.com today and donate for our legal defense fund.
[2:17:55.960 --> 2:17:58.960]  Look, it's not hype that Info Wars has changed the world.
[2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:01.960]  It's not hype that your support of Info Wars
[2:18:01.960 --> 2:18:03.960]  is the reason we were able to do this.
[2:18:03.960 --> 2:18:05.960]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[2:18:05.960 --> 2:18:09.960]  Now, you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[2:18:09.960 --> 2:18:11.960]  Well, high-quality iodine is the good halogen
[2:18:11.960 --> 2:18:13.960]  and does the opposite of fluoride.
[2:18:13.960 --> 2:18:14.960]  And when you've got it in your body,
[2:18:14.960 --> 2:18:15.960]  it doesn't just supercharge yourselves,
[2:18:15.960 --> 2:18:16.960]  it doesn't just give you more energy,
[2:18:16.960 --> 2:18:18.960]  it doesn't just boost your immune system,
[2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:21.960]  but it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride,
[2:18:21.960 --> 2:18:24.960]  chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[2:18:24.960 --> 2:18:26.960]  So, ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks,
[2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:28.960]  four X3 to kick in on average,
[2:18:28.960 --> 2:18:30.960]  take a few drops every day,
[2:18:30.960 --> 2:18:32.960]  and almost everyone has dramatic results.
[2:18:32.960 --> 2:18:34.960]  Plus, it funds the Info War.
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:38.960]  So what do you have to lose but taking action?

[2:18:58.960 --> 2:19:03.960]  It's the bad halogen to the same family as chlorine, bromide,
[2:19:03.960 --> 2:19:04.960]  you name it.
[2:19:04.960 --> 2:19:05.960]  What's the good halogen?
[2:19:05.960 --> 2:19:08.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine,

[2:20:18.960 --> 2:20:30.960]  I really don't have words to describe how insane it is
[2:20:30.960 --> 2:20:32.960]  in the first hour of this show today.
[2:20:32.960 --> 2:20:34.960]  I cover the New York Times, the Washington Post,
[2:20:34.960 --> 2:20:36.960]  you name it, going, oh, yeah, over the decades,
[2:20:36.960 --> 2:20:38.960]  they've created lots of viruses that will kill
[2:20:38.960 --> 2:20:42.960]  89% of us, but it's for all good.
[2:20:42.960 --> 2:20:44.960]  Then they go in front of Congress
[2:20:44.960 --> 2:20:46.960]  when the same people are interviewed bragging
[2:20:46.960 --> 2:20:49.960]  how they did it, like Fauci and others,
[2:20:49.960 --> 2:20:51.960]  and then say, none of it's going on.
[2:20:51.960 --> 2:20:56.960]  That's why we've got to expose the real Anthony Fauci.
[2:20:56.960 --> 2:20:58.960]  That exposes Bill Gates and Peter Dazik
[2:20:58.960 --> 2:21:01.960]  and the UN and the whole corporate biomedical
[2:21:01.960 --> 2:21:04.960]  tyranny we're facing.
[2:21:04.960 --> 2:21:07.960]  So I told you tonight, I told my wife,
[2:21:07.960 --> 2:21:10.960]  she wants to see it.
[2:21:10.960 --> 2:21:11.960]  The link was said to me two days ago
[2:21:11.960 --> 2:21:13.960]  and I've been so hammered, I haven't watched it.
[2:21:13.960 --> 2:21:15.960]  I've watched the trailers, I've read the book,
[2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:17.960]  it's the most important work out there
[2:21:17.960 --> 2:21:19.960]  on understanding this crime.
[2:21:19.960 --> 2:21:21.960]  I'll be watching it tonight, therealantonyfaucimovie.com.
[2:21:21.960 --> 2:21:23.960]  Everybody should go there.
[2:21:23.960 --> 2:21:25.960]  Everybody should watch it.
[2:21:25.960 --> 2:21:27.960]  Going back to Jeff Hayes, the great filmmaker
[2:21:27.960 --> 2:21:29.960]  that translated the book so quickly and so well
[2:21:29.960 --> 2:21:31.960]  into a film, wear the different platforms
[2:21:31.960 --> 2:21:33.960]  for folks to go see this movie,
[2:21:33.960 --> 2:21:35.960]  and they should have parties at their house
[2:21:35.960 --> 2:21:37.960]  or wakes, really.
[2:21:37.960 --> 2:21:39.960]  Events, churches should be showing this.
[2:21:39.960 --> 2:21:41.960]  I mean, they're producing stuff
[2:21:41.960 --> 2:21:43.960]  that's way worse than this
[2:21:43.960 --> 2:21:45.960]  that could get out at any time
[2:21:45.960 --> 2:21:47.960]  or they could release it.
[2:21:47.960 --> 2:21:49.960]  This is really, for me,
[2:21:49.960 --> 2:21:51.960]  the most important issue out there.
[2:21:51.960 --> 2:21:53.960]  They can see the film
[2:21:53.960 --> 2:21:55.960]  at therealantonyfaucimovie.com.
[2:21:55.960 --> 2:21:57.960]  Our site has already been blacklisted
[2:21:57.960 --> 2:21:59.960]  by eight different services.
[2:21:59.960 --> 2:22:01.960]  I was on a radio interview
[2:22:01.960 --> 2:22:03.960]  with CBN this morning
[2:22:03.960 --> 2:22:05.960]  and the host was saying,
[2:22:05.960 --> 2:22:07.960]  wow, I really wish I could see it,
[2:22:07.960 --> 2:22:09.960]  but the link doesn't work
[2:22:09.960 --> 2:22:11.960]  and he described me in one of their networks.
[2:22:11.960 --> 2:22:13.960]  They literally
[2:22:13.960 --> 2:22:15.960]  will not allow people to go to this site
[2:22:15.960 --> 2:22:17.960]  and that happened
[2:22:17.960 --> 2:22:19.960]  before the film came out
[2:22:19.960 --> 2:22:21.960]  and so they can't be reacting to the content.
[2:22:21.960 --> 2:22:23.960]  So we're going to have to play
[2:22:23.960 --> 2:22:25.960]  a little bit of cat and mouse to keep it out there
[2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:27.960]  but we know how to do this
[2:22:27.960 --> 2:22:29.960]  and it's that important.
[2:22:29.960 --> 2:22:31.960]  We're asking people to watch it.
[2:22:31.960 --> 2:22:33.960]  So tell me, one of the different platforms it's on,
[2:22:33.960 --> 2:22:35.960]  is it on Amazon?
[2:22:35.960 --> 2:22:37.960]  No, no, no. Amazon won't let us have it
[2:22:37.960 --> 2:22:39.960]  in any way.
[2:22:39.960 --> 2:22:41.960]  We have a DVD.
[2:22:41.960 --> 2:22:43.960]  We did five appeals
[2:22:43.960 --> 2:22:45.960]  on selling a thumb drive.
[2:22:45.960 --> 2:22:47.960]  So they let my book out,
[2:22:47.960 --> 2:22:49.960]  but wow, let's get the expert on this.
[2:22:49.960 --> 2:22:51.960]  Tony Lyons to comment.
[2:22:51.960 --> 2:22:53.960]  This is unprecedented Tony.
[2:22:53.960 --> 2:22:55.960]  Yeah, I've never seen anything like it.
[2:22:55.960 --> 2:22:57.960]  I mean, you know, if you have a better argument,
[2:22:57.960 --> 2:22:59.960]  you don't need censorship.
[2:22:59.960 --> 2:23:01.960]  You know, if you really believe
[2:23:01.960 --> 2:23:03.960]  that what you're saying is true,
[2:23:03.960 --> 2:23:05.960]  you don't have to shut down the opposing view.
[2:23:05.960 --> 2:23:07.960]  So, you know,
[2:23:07.960 --> 2:23:09.960]  she has the entire
[2:23:09.960 --> 2:23:11.960]  world believing him now
[2:23:11.960 --> 2:23:13.960]  and people watch this movie,
[2:23:13.960 --> 2:23:15.960]  they will no longer believe
[2:23:15.960 --> 2:23:17.960]  anything Dr. Fauci says.
[2:23:17.960 --> 2:23:19.960]  I guarantee you that
[2:23:19.960 --> 2:23:21.960]  this is that important a movie.
[2:23:21.960 --> 2:23:23.960]  People have to recognize...
[2:23:23.960 --> 2:23:25.960]  It's guaranteed Tony, two weeks ago,
[2:23:25.960 --> 2:23:27.960]  they had spokesperson of the UN said
[2:23:27.960 --> 2:23:29.960]  we run Google and all these other platforms
[2:23:29.960 --> 2:23:31.960]  to censor medical disinformation
[2:23:31.960 --> 2:23:33.960]  but everything we said is trying to be true.
[2:23:33.960 --> 2:23:35.960]  They're the liars.
[2:23:35.960 --> 2:23:37.960]  Sure, and you know,
[2:23:37.960 --> 2:23:39.960]  I mean, I've said it before
[2:23:39.960 --> 2:23:41.960]  but misinformation is just a way
[2:23:41.960 --> 2:23:43.960]  to shut down
[2:23:43.960 --> 2:23:45.960]  opposing views,
[2:23:45.960 --> 2:23:47.960]  counter narratives.
[2:23:47.960 --> 2:23:49.960]  So, what we need, if you disagree with this,
[2:23:49.960 --> 2:23:51.960]  you should come out and watch the movie,
[2:23:51.960 --> 2:23:53.960]  make a statement, explain to the world
[2:23:53.960 --> 2:23:55.960]  why things in the movie
[2:23:55.960 --> 2:23:57.960]  or in the book are incorrect
[2:23:57.960 --> 2:23:59.960]  and the fact that people can't do that
[2:23:59.960 --> 2:24:01.960]  is why they need censorship.
[2:24:01.960 --> 2:24:03.960]  But as we speak,
[2:24:03.960 --> 2:24:05.960]  the site is up at least a few minutes ago,
[2:24:05.960 --> 2:24:07.960]  Jeff Hayes,
[2:24:07.960 --> 2:24:09.960]  the real Anthony Fauci movie dot com.
[2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:11.960]  Everybody's got to see this movie.
[2:24:13.960 --> 2:24:15.960]  I started working on this
[2:24:15.960 --> 2:24:17.960]  film in January
[2:24:17.960 --> 2:24:19.960]  and you'll notice at the end, the credits,
[2:24:19.960 --> 2:24:21.960]  half of the people in the credits are redacted
[2:24:21.960 --> 2:24:23.960]  because they didn't
[2:24:23.960 --> 2:24:25.960]  want their name associated to the film.
[2:24:25.960 --> 2:24:27.960]  I jokingly call this
[2:24:27.960 --> 2:24:29.960]  my career ending film.
[2:24:29.960 --> 2:24:31.960]  I literally had to stop
[2:24:31.960 --> 2:24:33.960]  and think, you know, is it worth
[2:24:33.960 --> 2:24:35.960]  doing this
[2:24:35.960 --> 2:24:37.960]  to get this out because I've seen what's
[2:24:37.960 --> 2:24:39.960]  happened to Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[2:24:39.960 --> 2:24:41.960]  I've seen what's happened
[2:24:41.960 --> 2:24:43.960]  to his life, to his income
[2:24:43.960 --> 2:24:45.960]  and then
[2:24:45.960 --> 2:24:47.960]  eventually you come to the right decision
[2:24:47.960 --> 2:24:49.960]  that's like, wait a minute, this is worth it.
[2:24:49.960 --> 2:24:51.960]  If not me, who, and it's time to stand up.
[2:24:51.960 --> 2:24:53.960]  Well, that's where I am.
[2:24:53.960 --> 2:24:55.960]  All the giant Psalms against us, none of it's true.
[2:24:55.960 --> 2:24:57.960]  And you just learn, hey, I'm doing
[2:24:57.960 --> 2:24:59.960]  important work here, you got to do it.
[2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:01.960]  Wow, I haven't seen the film yet.
[2:25:01.960 --> 2:25:03.960]  I'm going to watch it tonight.
[2:25:03.960 --> 2:25:05.960]  Lay out what's in the film, Jeff.
[2:25:05.960 --> 2:25:07.960]  So we start out
[2:25:07.960 --> 2:25:09.960]  with what happened
[2:25:09.960 --> 2:25:11.960]  in 2019,
[2:25:11.960 --> 2:25:13.960]  2020. The film opens with
[2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:15.960]  Event 201 where they're doing
[2:25:15.960 --> 2:25:17.960]  a tabletop game
[2:25:17.960 --> 2:25:19.960]  of a coronavirus six weeks
[2:25:19.960 --> 2:25:21.960]  before the COVID-19
[2:25:21.960 --> 2:25:23.960]  was first announced
[2:25:23.960 --> 2:25:25.960]  and then you see that playbook follow
[2:25:25.960 --> 2:25:27.960]  out. Once we completely
[2:25:27.960 --> 2:25:29.960]  explore what happened in
[2:25:29.960 --> 2:25:31.960]  2020, then we go back
[2:25:31.960 --> 2:25:33.960]  to 1984
[2:25:33.960 --> 2:25:35.960]  and we show the AIDS crisis
[2:25:35.960 --> 2:25:37.960]  and how it was handled and the damage
[2:25:37.960 --> 2:25:39.960]  that was done
[2:25:39.960 --> 2:25:41.960]  and you start to get an idea
[2:25:41.960 --> 2:25:43.960]  of how he built this power
[2:25:43.960 --> 2:25:45.960]  base. This man has
[2:25:45.960 --> 2:25:47.960]  given away, has overseen
[2:25:47.960 --> 2:25:49.960]  the grants and funding
[2:25:49.960 --> 2:25:51.960]  of almost a trillion dollars
[2:25:51.960 --> 2:25:53.960]  in his career, 930
[2:25:53.960 --> 2:25:55.960]  billion dollars.
[2:25:55.960 --> 2:25:57.960]  So you can imagine the people
[2:25:57.960 --> 2:25:59.960]  that are beholden to him that are scared
[2:25:59.960 --> 2:26:01.960]  to speak out against him.
[2:26:01.960 --> 2:26:03.960]  Fortunately with him retiring,
[2:26:03.960 --> 2:26:05.960]  those type regimes, once he doesn't
[2:26:05.960 --> 2:26:07.960]  control the checkbook, I think
[2:26:07.960 --> 2:26:09.960]  those people will end up turning on him
[2:26:09.960 --> 2:26:11.960]  and it's going to be interesting to watch.
[2:26:11.960 --> 2:26:13.960]  Well, that was my next question.
[2:26:13.960 --> 2:26:15.960]  Congressional criminal hearings.
[2:26:15.960 --> 2:26:17.960]  We'll play this next segment, EU
[2:26:17.960 --> 2:26:19.960]  criminal hearings, criminal investigations.
[2:26:19.960 --> 2:26:21.960]  I mean, I don't put sugarcoating on things,
[2:26:21.960 --> 2:26:23.960]  but the silver lining is
[2:26:23.960 --> 2:26:25.960]  Tony, the world's waking up.
[2:26:25.960 --> 2:26:27.960]  The world is definitely
[2:26:27.960 --> 2:26:29.960]  waking up and people are flocking
[2:26:29.960 --> 2:26:31.960]  to other platforms because they
[2:26:31.960 --> 2:26:33.960]  know that the media is
[2:26:33.960 --> 2:26:35.960]  controlled, that big tech
[2:26:35.960 --> 2:26:37.960]  is controlled and that their
[2:26:37.960 --> 2:26:39.960]  government is captured
[2:26:39.960 --> 2:26:41.960]  by big pharmaceutical companies.
[2:26:41.960 --> 2:26:43.960]  So more and more people
[2:26:43.960 --> 2:26:45.960]  are standing up
[2:26:45.960 --> 2:26:47.960]  speaking out and not allowing
[2:26:47.960 --> 2:26:49.960]  this globalist,
[2:26:49.960 --> 2:26:51.960]  you know, sort of regime
[2:26:51.960 --> 2:26:53.960]  this globalist narrative
[2:26:53.960 --> 2:26:55.960]  to take over this
[2:26:55.960 --> 2:26:57.960]  country and this world.
[2:26:57.960 --> 2:26:59.960]  And we all need to fight, but we need
[2:26:59.960 --> 2:27:01.960]  to watch movies like this,
[2:27:01.960 --> 2:27:03.960]  watch shows like yours,
[2:27:03.960 --> 2:27:05.960]  and really begin to understand,
[2:27:05.960 --> 2:27:07.960]  to wake up to the way the things
[2:27:07.960 --> 2:27:09.960]  the world is really working now.
[2:27:09.960 --> 2:27:11.960]  Well, that's right. This is a total
[2:27:11.960 --> 2:27:13.960]  information war. Let me ask you this
[2:27:13.960 --> 2:27:15.960]  today, we're going to break and play some of the
[2:27:15.960 --> 2:27:17.960]  EU criminal investigations starting.
[2:27:17.960 --> 2:27:19.960]  If you're a big farmer, you already control the government,
[2:27:19.960 --> 2:27:21.960]  you just sell something that works or is a
[2:27:21.960 --> 2:27:23.960]  placebo, at least it doesn't hurt people.
[2:27:23.960 --> 2:27:25.960]  We know CDC documents in 2000 predicted
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:27.960]  it would do all this. Why would they bring
[2:27:27.960 --> 2:27:29.960]  out a drug that hates, that hurts
[2:27:29.960 --> 2:27:31.960]  people? This is bigger
[2:27:31.960 --> 2:27:33.960]  than profit. What do you think is happening here?
[2:27:33.960 --> 2:27:35.960]  Yeah, so that's just
[2:27:35.960 --> 2:27:37.960]  so scary to think about.
[2:27:37.960 --> 2:27:39.960]  It's really clear
[2:27:39.960 --> 2:27:41.960]  that this is about money and
[2:27:41.960 --> 2:27:43.960]  power and the details of
[2:27:43.960 --> 2:27:45.960]  why they're doing it and the specific
[2:27:45.960 --> 2:27:47.960]  way that they're doing it is just
[2:27:47.960 --> 2:27:49.960]  not my comprehension.
[2:27:49.960 --> 2:27:51.960]  But I think people just have to recognize
[2:27:51.960 --> 2:27:53.960]  that this is happening, that
[2:27:53.960 --> 2:27:55.960]  freedom of speech is being shut down
[2:27:55.960 --> 2:27:57.960]  in this country, that people's
[2:27:57.960 --> 2:27:59.960]  rights are being taken from them,
[2:27:59.960 --> 2:28:01.960]  that people are being forced
[2:28:01.960 --> 2:28:03.960]  to take a vaccine that hasn't
[2:28:03.960 --> 2:28:05.960]  been well tested and that is winding
[2:28:05.960 --> 2:28:07.960]  up, killing people,
[2:28:07.960 --> 2:28:09.960]  injuring people, landing them in the hospital,
[2:28:09.960 --> 2:28:11.960]  that we're not getting real
[2:28:11.960 --> 2:28:13.960]  science, real research, and that
[2:28:13.960 --> 2:28:15.960]  the people who are fighting tooth and nail
[2:28:15.960 --> 2:28:17.960]  to tell the truth to the American
[2:28:17.960 --> 2:28:19.960]  public, those are the heroes and those
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:21.960]  are the people where we're told
[2:28:21.960 --> 2:28:23.960]  time after time that it's
[2:28:23.960 --> 2:28:25.960]  misinformation, it's a conspiracy theory
[2:28:25.960 --> 2:28:27.960]  that it's a narrative
[2:28:27.960 --> 2:28:29.960]  that isn't true. But we've been proven
[2:28:29.960 --> 2:28:31.960]  totally correct. Stay there, both Jeff
[2:28:31.960 --> 2:28:33.960]  Hayes, the filmmaker, and Tony Lyons
[2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:35.960]  that got the book published, incredible.
[2:28:35.960 --> 2:28:37.960]  The real Anthony Fauci movie dot com. Folks,
[2:28:37.960 --> 2:28:39.960]  I know you already know all this or you think you do.
[2:28:39.960 --> 2:28:41.960]  You are the
[2:28:41.960 --> 2:28:43.960]  vector of the truth. You, the viewers
[2:28:43.960 --> 2:28:45.960]  have to go get the film and show it to your
[2:28:45.960 --> 2:28:47.960]  friends and family now. We will
[2:28:47.960 --> 2:28:49.960]  bring these people to justice or
[2:28:49.960 --> 2:28:51.960]  they got new bio weapons ready for us.
[2:28:51.960 --> 2:28:53.960]  I'm not going to take it lying down.
[2:28:53.960 --> 2:29:15.960]  Let's see the film. We'll be right back.
[2:29:23.960 --> 2:29:33.960]  We'll be right back.
[2:29:53.960 --> 2:29:55.960]  We've all heard of interventions
[2:29:55.960 --> 2:29:57.960]  with a family member
[2:29:57.960 --> 2:29:59.960]  or a friend or a co-worker
[2:29:59.960 --> 2:30:01.960]  that's on drugs or alcohol
[2:30:01.960 --> 2:30:03.960]  and is in a bad place and they need family
[2:30:03.960 --> 2:30:05.960]  and friends to come to their aid
[2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:07.960]  and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[2:30:07.960 --> 2:30:09.960]  Well, it's the same thing for America
[2:30:09.960 --> 2:30:11.960]  the rest of the world.
[2:30:11.960 --> 2:30:13.960]  When it comes to critical vitamins
[2:30:13.960 --> 2:30:15.960]  and minerals that your body must have to
[2:30:15.960 --> 2:30:17.960]  live and people don't listen
[2:30:17.960 --> 2:30:19.960]  and they don't supplement, it's
[2:30:19.960 --> 2:30:21.960]  literally an intervention. I lead
[2:30:21.960 --> 2:30:23.960]  an incredibly stressful life.
[2:30:23.960 --> 2:30:25.960]  I don't play with Mr. Health
[2:30:25.960 --> 2:30:27.960]  but if I wasn't taking
[2:30:27.960 --> 2:30:29.960]  products like X3 from
[2:30:29.960 --> 2:30:31.960]  infowars.com I could not continue

[2:30:37.960 --> 2:30:39.960]  incredible and despite the fact that

[2:30:49.960 --> 2:30:51.960]  it for what it does for your immune system

[2:30:57.960 --> 2:30:59.960]  Once a tragedy reaches a level
[2:30:59.960 --> 2:31:01.960]  of national significance,
[2:31:01.960 --> 2:31:03.960]  American citizens should be
[2:31:03.960 --> 2:31:05.960]  allowed to basically question
[2:31:05.960 --> 2:31:07.960]  that event in any way that
[2:31:07.960 --> 2:31:09.960]  they deem fit. The First Amendment
[2:31:09.960 --> 2:31:11.960]  is unique in the world. That's what they want to take
[2:31:11.960 --> 2:31:13.960]  away, your ability to speak freely.
[2:31:13.960 --> 2:31:15.960]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next
[2:31:15.960 --> 2:31:17.960]  or they're going to go for Steve Bannon or
[2:31:17.960 --> 2:31:19.960]  Carlson. I studied the globalist 30
[2:31:19.960 --> 2:31:21.960]  years ago but only 28 years
[2:31:21.960 --> 2:31:23.960]  and I knew they were planning all of this
[2:31:23.960 --> 2:31:25.960]  and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere
[2:31:25.960 --> 2:31:27.960]  but I couldn't have done it without your support
[2:31:27.960 --> 2:31:29.960]  and now because we've been so successful
[2:31:29.960 --> 2:31:31.960]  warning the population of the planet, not just America
[2:31:31.960 --> 2:31:33.960]  we're public enemy number one
[2:31:33.960 --> 2:31:35.960]  when it comes to the global agenda.
[2:31:35.960 --> 2:31:37.960]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize
[2:31:37.960 --> 2:31:39.960]  how successful infowars has been
[2:31:39.960 --> 2:31:41.960]  because of your past support. So I salute

[2:32:05.960 --> 2:32:07.960]  before seen in the western world
[2:32:07.960 --> 2:32:09.960]  against independent media. Thanks for keeping
[2:32:09.960 --> 2:32:11.960]  me in the fight and over the years you have
[2:32:11.960 --> 2:32:13.960]  come to the table, you have stepped to the plate

[2:32:17.960 --> 2:32:19.960]  But now I have my own
[2:32:19.960 --> 2:32:21.960]  legal bills that have reached the point
[2:32:21.960 --> 2:32:23.960]  that I can't pay them and I need your support.
[2:32:23.960 --> 2:32:25.960]  So if you want to keep this operation

[2:32:41.960 --> 2:32:43.960]  of their attacks, four years in the making
[2:32:43.960 --> 2:32:45.960]  is almost over and right at the end
[2:32:45.960 --> 2:32:47.960]  we're not giving up, we're not giving

[2:32:57.960 --> 2:32:59.960]  Leading a frontal assault
[2:32:59.960 --> 2:33:01.960]  on the lies of the New World Order
[2:33:01.960 --> 2:33:11.960]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:11.960 --> 2:33:13.960]  Live from the Infowars.com
[2:33:13.960 --> 2:33:33.960]  Studios it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:33.960 --> 2:33:55.960]  Well I told listeners
[2:33:55.960 --> 2:33:57.960]  that the whole Sandy Hook propaganda
[2:33:57.960 --> 2:33:59.960]  campaign against us
[2:33:59.960 --> 2:34:01.960]  was synthetic
[2:34:01.960 --> 2:34:03.960]  and we knew it was all coordinated. The judge
[2:34:03.960 --> 2:34:05.960]  said no you can't say that, you can't bring that up
[2:34:05.960 --> 2:34:07.960]  you've been found guilty by me. They've now
[2:34:07.960 --> 2:34:09.960]  put out press releases bragging. It was all
[2:34:09.960 --> 2:34:11.960]  coordinated by Bloomberg and other groups
[2:34:11.960 --> 2:34:13.960]  in the last four years to bring me down
[2:34:13.960 --> 2:34:15.960]  they think than to bring you down
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:17.960]  we're gonna be covering that after our guest leave
[2:34:17.960 --> 2:34:19.960]  that's one thing these super villains
[2:34:19.960 --> 2:34:21.960]  love to do is brag
[2:34:21.960 --> 2:34:23.960]  about what they've done.
[2:34:23.960 --> 2:34:25.960]  Literally take stuff I didn't even really say out of context
[2:34:25.960 --> 2:34:27.960]  twist it make it a huge issue
[2:34:27.960 --> 2:34:29.960]  and then rig the whole thing
[2:34:29.960 --> 2:34:31.960]  and they think that's their plan to shut us down
[2:34:31.960 --> 2:34:33.960]  they'll never shut us down.
[2:34:33.960 --> 2:34:35.960]  Humanity is awake now.
[2:34:35.960 --> 2:34:37.960]  Okay
[2:34:37.960 --> 2:34:39.960]  I want to play Melissa Fleming
[2:34:39.960 --> 2:34:41.960]  the head of the UN's information
[2:34:41.960 --> 2:34:43.960]  Bureau
[2:34:43.960 --> 2:34:45.960]  I want to play this clip
[2:34:45.960 --> 2:34:47.960]  of her just a few weeks ago saying
[2:34:47.960 --> 2:34:49.960]  Google and others
[2:34:49.960 --> 2:34:51.960]  take the orders from the United Nations
[2:34:51.960 --> 2:34:53.960]  on what can be heard
[2:34:53.960 --> 2:34:55.960]  and what can't be heard.
[2:34:55.960 --> 2:34:57.960]  You know we partnered with Google
[2:34:57.960 --> 2:34:59.960]  for example if you Google climate change
[2:34:59.960 --> 2:35:01.960]  you will
[2:35:01.960 --> 2:35:03.960]  at the top of your search
[2:35:03.960 --> 2:35:05.960]  you will get all kinds of UN resources
[2:35:05.960 --> 2:35:07.960]  we
[2:35:07.960 --> 2:35:09.960]  started this partnership when we were
[2:35:09.960 --> 2:35:11.960]  shocked to see that when we Googled
[2:35:11.960 --> 2:35:13.960]  climate change we were getting
[2:35:13.960 --> 2:35:15.960]  incredibly distorted
[2:35:15.960 --> 2:35:17.960]  information right at the top
[2:35:17.960 --> 2:35:19.960]  so we're becoming much more proactive
[2:35:19.960 --> 2:35:21.960]  you know we own the science
[2:35:21.960 --> 2:35:23.960]  and we think that the world
[2:35:23.960 --> 2:35:25.960]  you know should know it and
[2:35:25.960 --> 2:35:27.960]  the platforms themselves also do
[2:35:27.960 --> 2:35:29.960]  but
[2:35:29.960 --> 2:35:31.960]  it's a huge
[2:35:31.960 --> 2:35:33.960]  huge challenge
[2:35:33.960 --> 2:35:35.960]  that I think all sectors of society
[2:35:35.960 --> 2:35:37.960]  need to
[2:35:37.960 --> 2:35:39.960]  be very active in.
[2:35:39.960 --> 2:35:41.960]  They own the science even though
[2:35:41.960 --> 2:35:43.960]  everything they told you from blocking therapeutics
[2:35:43.960 --> 2:35:45.960]  to claiming that the vaccine was a
[2:35:45.960 --> 2:35:47.960]  vaccine or that it worked.
[2:35:47.960 --> 2:35:49.960]  Now here's a very important clip
[2:35:49.960 --> 2:35:51.960]  here's a member of the European Union Parliament
[2:35:51.960 --> 2:35:53.960]  Kristin Turras
[2:35:53.960 --> 2:35:55.960]  for the immediate resignation of the president
[2:35:55.960 --> 2:35:57.960]  Ursula
[2:35:57.960 --> 2:35:59.960]  Vanderland who it turns out
[2:35:59.960 --> 2:36:01.960]  signed secret deals with Pfizer and Moderna
[2:36:01.960 --> 2:36:03.960]  for the forced injections here at us.
[2:36:03.960 --> 2:36:05.960]  Ursula von der Leyen
[2:36:05.960 --> 2:36:07.960]  must immediately
[2:36:07.960 --> 2:36:09.960]  and unconditionally resign
[2:36:09.960 --> 2:36:11.960]  from her position as president
[2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:13.960]  of the European Commission
[2:36:13.960 --> 2:36:15.960]  due to the fact
[2:36:15.960 --> 2:36:17.960]  that her actions are currently
[2:36:17.960 --> 2:36:19.960]  criminally investigated
[2:36:19.960 --> 2:36:21.960]  by the European Public Prosecutors Office
[2:36:21.960 --> 2:36:23.960]  EPPO
[2:36:23.960 --> 2:36:25.960]  just announced few days ago
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:27.960]  that is investigating the way the contracts
[2:36:27.960 --> 2:36:29.960]  were signed between the European Commission
[2:36:29.960 --> 2:36:31.960]  and the producers
[2:36:31.960 --> 2:36:33.960]  of vaccines
[2:36:33.960 --> 2:36:35.960]  and this is what
[2:36:35.960 --> 2:36:37.960]  the Court of Auditors just stated in the report
[2:36:37.960 --> 2:36:39.960]  released few days ago and I quote
[2:36:39.960 --> 2:36:41.960]  the commission has signed
[2:36:41.960 --> 2:36:43.960]  up to November 2021
[2:36:43.960 --> 2:36:45.960]  71 billion
[2:36:45.960 --> 2:36:47.960]  euros worth of contracts
[2:36:47.960 --> 2:36:49.960]  on behalf of the member states
[2:36:49.960 --> 2:36:51.960]  to purchase up to 4.6 billion
[2:36:51.960 --> 2:36:53.960]  COVID-19
[2:36:53.960 --> 2:36:55.960]  vaccine doses
[2:36:55.960 --> 2:36:57.960]  that means that she purchased
[2:36:57.960 --> 2:36:59.960]  10 doses of vaccines
[2:36:59.960 --> 2:37:01.960]  for every EU citizen
[2:37:01.960 --> 2:37:03.960]  based on contracts that were never released to the public
[2:37:03.960 --> 2:37:05.960]  this is how the contracts
[2:37:05.960 --> 2:37:07.960]  that she signed with this pharmaceutical companies
[2:37:07.960 --> 2:37:09.960]  were released to the public
[2:37:09.960 --> 2:37:11.960]  how is this possible in the European Union
[2:37:11.960 --> 2:37:13.960]  that is called to be transparent
[2:37:13.960 --> 2:37:15.960]  with the ways using people's money
[2:37:15.960 --> 2:37:17.960]  so I'm asking again and calling again
[2:37:17.960 --> 2:37:19.960]  for immediate
[2:37:19.960 --> 2:37:21.960]  and unconditional resignation
[2:37:21.960 --> 2:37:23.960]  thank you
[2:37:23.960 --> 2:37:25.960]  this is an information war
[2:37:25.960 --> 2:37:27.960]  Jeff Hayes made the film based on
[2:37:27.960 --> 2:37:29.960]  the number one best-selling
[2:37:29.960 --> 2:37:31.960]  book
[2:37:31.960 --> 2:37:33.960]  The Real Anthony Fauci, the Real Anthony Fauci movie
[2:37:33.960 --> 2:37:35.960]  Jeff Hayes
[2:37:35.960 --> 2:37:37.960]  comments on the situation that Tony Lyons
[2:37:37.960 --> 2:37:39.960]  who's had the courage is one of the
[2:37:39.960 --> 2:37:41.960]  now the biggest independent publisher
[2:37:41.960 --> 2:37:43.960]  but one of the biggest publishers now
[2:37:43.960 --> 2:37:45.960]  promoting truth and freedom
[2:37:45.960 --> 2:37:47.960]  about what this signifies
[2:37:49.960 --> 2:37:51.960]  the amount of money at stake here
[2:37:51.960 --> 2:37:53.960]  is staggering
[2:37:53.960 --> 2:37:55.960]  where you have now big pharma
[2:37:55.960 --> 2:37:57.960]  is the biggest industry
[2:37:57.960 --> 2:37:59.960]  when I grew up it was always oil and gas
[2:37:59.960 --> 2:38:01.960]  was the biggest
[2:38:01.960 --> 2:38:03.960]  they have more lobbyists in Washington DC
[2:38:03.960 --> 2:38:05.960]  than there are congressmen
[2:38:05.960 --> 2:38:07.960]  senators, supreme court justices
[2:38:07.960 --> 2:38:09.960]  the power that they wield
[2:38:09.960 --> 2:38:11.960]  by the
[2:38:11.960 --> 2:38:13.960]  staggering amount of money
[2:38:13.960 --> 2:38:15.960]  that they're making
[2:38:15.960 --> 2:38:17.960]  and as we become less healthy
[2:38:17.960 --> 2:38:19.960]  we become better customers for them
[2:38:19.960 --> 2:38:21.960]  it is a very sick system
[2:38:21.960 --> 2:38:23.960]  built on by some very greedy people
[2:38:25.960 --> 2:38:27.960]  and here they are trying to suppress
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:29.960]  your film you know when Orson Welles
[2:38:29.960 --> 2:38:31.960]  had since the game suppressed he became a cost
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:33.960]  celeb but now the left
[2:38:33.960 --> 2:38:35.960]  loves censoring people Tony Lyons
[2:38:35.960 --> 2:38:37.960]  yeah if you really
[2:38:37.960 --> 2:38:39.960]  own the science
[2:38:39.960 --> 2:38:41.960]  why do you have to shut down the counter argument
[2:38:41.960 --> 2:38:43.960]  the real Anthony Fauci book
[2:38:43.960 --> 2:38:45.960]  and the real Anthony Fauci movie
[2:38:45.960 --> 2:38:47.960]  this has
[2:38:47.960 --> 2:38:49.960]  2,194
[2:38:49.960 --> 2:38:51.960]  citations it cites
[2:38:51.960 --> 2:38:53.960]  hundreds and hundreds of peer reviewed studies
[2:38:53.960 --> 2:38:55.960]  it was meticulously researched
[2:38:55.960 --> 2:38:57.960]  if they really own the science
[2:38:57.960 --> 2:38:59.960]  then they should fight about the science
[2:38:59.960 --> 2:39:01.960]  they should not try to
[2:39:01.960 --> 2:39:03.960]  shut down every counter
[2:39:03.960 --> 2:39:05.960]  argument that's a sign of weakness
[2:39:05.960 --> 2:39:07.960]  that's a sign that they're corrupt
[2:39:07.960 --> 2:39:09.960]  that they're greedy
[2:39:09.960 --> 2:39:11.960]  that it's not about public health
[2:39:11.960 --> 2:39:13.960]  it's not about science
[2:39:13.960 --> 2:39:15.960]  it's about money and power
[2:39:15.960 --> 2:39:17.960]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[2:39:17.960 --> 2:39:19.960]  was right about the Hudson River
[2:39:19.960 --> 2:39:21.960]  he was right about mercury and early childhood vaccines
[2:39:21.960 --> 2:39:23.960]  he was right about Monsanto
[2:39:23.960 --> 2:39:25.960]  and he's right about Dr. Fauci
[2:39:25.960 --> 2:39:27.960]  Dr. Fauci on the other hand
[2:39:27.960 --> 2:39:29.960]  has lied repeatedly
[2:39:29.960 --> 2:39:31.960]  and he's brought you
[2:39:31.960 --> 2:39:33.960]  and brought this country
[2:39:33.960 --> 2:39:35.960]  to a point where we no longer have our freedoms
[2:39:35.960 --> 2:39:37.960]  and we need to fight back
[2:39:37.960 --> 2:39:39.960]  and reclaim our freedoms
[2:39:39.960 --> 2:39:41.960]  after this insane period
[2:39:41.960 --> 2:39:43.960]  and that's a key point
[2:39:43.960 --> 2:39:45.960]  he's not wrong he's lying on purpose
[2:39:45.960 --> 2:39:47.960]  and it's a biomedical
[2:39:47.960 --> 2:39:49.960]  takeover
[2:39:49.960 --> 2:39:51.960]  that we're witnessing and I know we're not
[2:39:51.960 --> 2:39:53.960]  taking our horn here but I mean everything
[2:39:53.960 --> 2:39:55.960]  they said was a lie they admit the shot doesn't work
[2:39:55.960 --> 2:39:57.960]  makes you sick
[2:39:57.960 --> 2:39:59.960]  erases your immune system
[2:39:59.960 --> 2:40:01.960]  I don't think this Tony Lyons is going the way they thought it would go
[2:40:03.960 --> 2:40:05.960]  I think that
[2:40:05.960 --> 2:40:07.960]  they thought that
[2:40:07.960 --> 2:40:09.960]  using these incredible new methods
[2:40:09.960 --> 2:40:11.960]  of censoring
[2:40:11.960 --> 2:40:13.960]  any kind of a counter argument
[2:40:13.960 --> 2:40:15.960]  you know any kind of
[2:40:15.960 --> 2:40:17.960]  real dialogue in this country
[2:40:17.960 --> 2:40:19.960]  any kind of real marketplace of ideas
[2:40:19.960 --> 2:40:21.960]  that they were just going to have
[2:40:21.960 --> 2:40:23.960]  ultimate control over
[2:40:23.960 --> 2:40:25.960]  every narrative and what they're finding
[2:40:25.960 --> 2:40:27.960]  is that people are not
[2:40:27.960 --> 2:40:29.960]  that easy to fool
[2:40:29.960 --> 2:40:31.960]  that people are fighting back
[2:40:31.960 --> 2:40:33.960]  they're watching shows that tell
[2:40:33.960 --> 2:40:35.960]  the truth and that they're not
[2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:37.960]  willing to accept
[2:40:37.960 --> 2:40:39.960]  this narrative and this
[2:40:39.960 --> 2:40:41.960]  situation where we're
[2:40:41.960 --> 2:40:43.960]  losing all of our freedom and where
[2:40:43.960 --> 2:40:45.960]  the truth is just supposed to be
[2:40:45.960 --> 2:40:47.960]  whatever they tell us it is
[2:40:47.960 --> 2:40:49.960]  and I totally agree
[2:40:49.960 --> 2:40:51.960]  we'll just do one more segment but
[2:40:51.960 --> 2:40:53.960]  here's the demarcation line
[2:40:53.960 --> 2:40:55.960]  when we're asleep and we know that the social contract
[2:40:55.960 --> 2:40:57.960]  is broken we're easy to manipulate
[2:40:57.960 --> 2:40:59.960]  but as soon as it's broken
[2:40:59.960 --> 2:41:01.960]  we're not these compliant slaves we were before
[2:41:01.960 --> 2:41:03.960]  and now that compliance isn't there
[2:41:03.960 --> 2:41:05.960]  I think that's what you're saying
[2:41:05.960 --> 2:41:07.960]  no matter what they try or do now
[2:41:07.960 --> 2:41:09.960]  I mean I can feel it I can see it
[2:41:09.960 --> 2:41:11.960]  they're going to pay for what they've done
[2:41:11.960 --> 2:41:13.960]  Sure and I mean
[2:41:13.960 --> 2:41:15.960]  Jeff Hayes has done heroic
[2:41:15.960 --> 2:41:17.960]  work here to bring this story
[2:41:17.960 --> 2:41:19.960]  to the American public so that they
[2:41:19.960 --> 2:41:21.960]  can see that they've been lied to
[2:41:21.960 --> 2:41:23.960]  they've been doomed and that what they
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:25.960]  believe is misinformation
[2:41:25.960 --> 2:41:27.960]  or conspiracy theories is
[2:41:27.960 --> 2:41:29.960]  just a different point of view
[2:41:29.960 --> 2:41:31.960]  and it's a point of view that is not
[2:41:31.960 --> 2:41:33.960]  about taking your money
[2:41:33.960 --> 2:41:35.960]  and your power and your freedom
[2:41:35.960 --> 2:41:37.960]  it's about letting you
[2:41:37.960 --> 2:41:39.960]  live your life
[2:41:39.960 --> 2:41:41.960]  well it's also a point of view when he started out 8 months ago making it
[2:41:41.960 --> 2:41:43.960]  when it was proven we were right
[2:41:43.960 --> 2:41:45.960]  but now it's totally proven right
[2:41:45.960 --> 2:41:47.960]  Jeff how does that feel because everything
[2:41:47.960 --> 2:41:49.960]  in your film is evergreen now
[2:41:49.960 --> 2:41:51.960]  the wheel is spinning
[2:41:51.960 --> 2:41:53.960]  the pendulum is moving
[2:41:53.960 --> 2:41:55.960]  I mean this is the biggest issue right now
[2:41:55.960 --> 2:41:57.960]  I was much more afraid
[2:41:57.960 --> 2:41:59.960]  February March every
[2:41:59.960 --> 2:42:01.960]  day that goes by
[2:42:01.960 --> 2:42:03.960]  they have a reality problem
[2:42:03.960 --> 2:42:05.960]  people are seeing
[2:42:05.960 --> 2:42:07.960]  that the vaccine didn't work
[2:42:07.960 --> 2:42:09.960]  they're seeing the injuries
[2:42:09.960 --> 2:42:11.960]  they're seeing the myocarditis
[2:42:11.960 --> 2:42:13.960]  with their own eyes and you can only deny
[2:42:13.960 --> 2:42:15.960]  it so long until people
[2:42:15.960 --> 2:42:17.960]  see it with their own
[2:42:17.960 --> 2:42:19.960]  eyes and they're seeing it
[2:42:19.960 --> 2:42:21.960]  in parents that are not willing
[2:42:21.960 --> 2:42:23.960]  to get their children vaccinated
[2:42:23.960 --> 2:42:25.960]  and this is
[2:42:25.960 --> 2:42:27.960]  just increasing as people become
[2:42:27.960 --> 2:42:29.960]  more and more aware
[2:42:29.960 --> 2:42:31.960]  so I think our timing is actually
[2:42:31.960 --> 2:42:33.960]  very good it's now time
[2:42:33.960 --> 2:42:35.960]  where it's not just us sharing this information amongst ourselves
[2:42:35.960 --> 2:42:37.960]  now it's time to
[2:42:37.960 --> 2:42:39.960]  make a bigger tent and invite other
[2:42:39.960 --> 2:43:05.960]  people in
[2:43:05.960 --> 2:43:11.960]  the world to come and see it
[2:43:11.960 --> 2:43:13.960]  and it's been sold out for a while
[2:43:13.960 --> 2:43:15.960]  but it's finally back in stock
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:17.960]  vitamin mineral fusion does it just
[2:43:17.960 --> 2:43:19.960]  supercharge your immune system
[2:43:19.960 --> 2:43:21.960]  but it helps every cellular function
[2:43:21.960 --> 2:43:23.960]  of the body it has all the minerals
[2:43:23.960 --> 2:43:25.960]  all the key amino acids
[2:43:25.960 --> 2:43:27.960]  all of the essential vitamins that you need to
[2:43:27.960 --> 2:43:29.960]  live and be healthy
[2:43:29.960 --> 2:43:31.960]  essential means without these things you die
[2:43:31.960 --> 2:43:33.960]  and so much of the food is debased
[2:43:33.960 --> 2:43:35.960]  so many chemicals in the environment
[2:43:35.960 --> 2:43:37.960]  it is critical to bolster our body's
[2:43:37.960 --> 2:43:39.960]  defenses with a product like this
[2:43:39.960 --> 2:43:41.960]  now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there
[2:43:41.960 --> 2:43:43.960]  but this is amongst the very best
[2:43:43.960 --> 2:43:45.960]  and it's a low price and it funds the
[2:43:45.960 --> 2:43:47.960]  infill war so the only way you lose
[2:43:47.960 --> 2:43:49.960]  is not taking action today getting vitamin mineral fusion
[2:43:49.960 --> 2:43:51.960]  finally back in stock
[2:43:51.960 --> 2:43:53.960]  at infillwarstore.com for a 50% off
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:55.960]  vitamin mineral fusion back in stock
[2:43:55.960 --> 2:43:57.960]  infillwarstore.com
[2:43:57.960 --> 2:43:59.960]  I have been in a
[2:43:59.960 --> 2:44:01.960]  28 year marathon
[2:44:01.960 --> 2:44:03.960]  battle with the globalist
[2:44:03.960 --> 2:44:05.960]  I have come from nowhere
[2:44:05.960 --> 2:44:07.960]  to the very heights of politics
[2:44:07.960 --> 2:44:09.960]  not just in America but in the world
[2:44:09.960 --> 2:44:11.960]  we are engaging the globalist
[2:44:11.960 --> 2:44:13.960]  at point blank range
[2:44:13.960 --> 2:44:15.960]  in the information war
[2:44:15.960 --> 2:44:17.960]  but I don't deserve the credit
[2:44:17.960 --> 2:44:19.960]  yes I've persevered but the listeners
[2:44:19.960 --> 2:44:21.960]  and viewers who support infill wars
[2:44:21.960 --> 2:44:23.960]  for the real reason you've had the success
[2:44:23.960 --> 2:44:25.960]  we're having now
[2:44:25.960 --> 2:44:27.960]  the greatest victories in the fight against
[2:44:27.960 --> 2:44:29.960]  the new war you've ever had
[2:44:29.960 --> 2:44:31.960]  we are now entering
[2:44:31.960 --> 2:44:33.960]  the final mile of the marathon
[2:44:33.960 --> 2:44:35.960]  and that's why today
[2:44:35.960 --> 2:44:37.960]  it's more important than ever
[2:44:37.960 --> 2:44:39.960]  realize how important you've been in this fight
[2:44:39.960 --> 2:44:41.960]  and to continue in the efforts you've been
[2:44:41.960 --> 2:44:43.960]  carrying out and to intensify them
[2:44:43.960 --> 2:44:45.960]  God bless you all
[2:44:45.960 --> 2:44:47.960]  I salute you, I thank you
[2:44:47.960 --> 2:44:49.960]  and I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[2:44:49.960 --> 2:44:51.960]  because we are over the target
[2:44:51.960 --> 2:44:53.960]  and this grief is happening
[2:44:53.960 --> 2:44:55.960]  the fight is my fight, it's your fight
[2:44:55.960 --> 2:44:57.960]  it's our fight, God bless you all
[2:44:57.960 --> 2:44:59.960]  don't promote things unless they really work
[2:44:59.960 --> 2:45:01.960]  when it comes to politics
[2:45:01.960 --> 2:45:03.960]  or culture
[2:45:03.960 --> 2:45:05.960]  economics, we are always
[2:45:05.960 --> 2:45:07.960]  the cutting edge of the tip of the spear
[2:45:07.960 --> 2:45:09.960]  and when we talk about the products in infill wars 4.com
[2:45:09.960 --> 2:45:11.960]  they all blow you away
[2:45:11.960 --> 2:45:13.960]  if you'll just take them, if you'll just try them
[2:45:13.960 --> 2:45:15.960]  I know you'll be, we'll be customers
[2:45:15.960 --> 2:45:17.960]  and finally one of our best selling products
[2:45:17.960 --> 2:45:19.960]  sold out for months, it's back on stock, it's X3

[2:46:53.960 --> 2:46:55.960]  it's a critical fight
[2:46:55.960 --> 2:47:17.960]  at infowarstore.com right now
[2:47:25.960 --> 2:47:27.960]  this is a clear and present danger
[2:47:27.960 --> 2:47:29.960]  it's all of humanity
[2:47:29.960 --> 2:47:31.960]  and anyone listening should be aware of this
[2:47:31.960 --> 2:47:33.960]  and upset
[2:47:33.960 --> 2:47:35.960]  I have four children
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:37.960]  I plan on having grandchildren
[2:47:37.960 --> 2:47:39.960]  and this is an affront to all of
[2:47:39.960 --> 2:47:41.960]  human life on this planet
[2:47:41.960 --> 2:47:43.960]  it is disgusting
[2:47:43.960 --> 2:47:45.960]  so we're in an information war
[2:47:45.960 --> 2:47:47.960]  and yes, this broadcast is about promoting
[2:47:47.960 --> 2:47:49.960]  whatever is the truth
[2:47:49.960 --> 2:47:51.960]  whatever is most effective against tyranny
[2:47:51.960 --> 2:47:53.960]  and the film
[2:47:53.960 --> 2:47:55.960]  is critical
[2:47:55.960 --> 2:47:57.960]  I'll be watching it tonight with my wife
[2:47:57.960 --> 2:47:59.960]  and my children
[2:47:59.960 --> 2:48:01.960]  Jeffhaysfilms.com
[2:48:01.960 --> 2:48:03.960]  Jeffhays, looking at this
[2:48:03.960 --> 2:48:05.960]  and just a call to arms politically
[2:48:05.960 --> 2:48:07.960]  this is an information war
[2:48:07.960 --> 2:48:09.960]  we talk about that constantly
[2:48:09.960 --> 2:48:11.960]  the saying goes
[2:48:11.960 --> 2:48:13.960]  the propaganda wouldn't be necessary if the situation was hopeless
[2:48:13.960 --> 2:48:15.960]  they are so scared of the book
[2:48:15.960 --> 2:48:17.960]  thanks to Robert Kennedy Jr
[2:48:17.960 --> 2:48:19.960]  and Tony Lyons
[2:48:19.960 --> 2:48:21.960]  and they're so scared of your film
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:23.960]  they're usually reached 10, 20, 30
[2:48:23.960 --> 2:48:25.960]  times that we are so close
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:27.960]  to bringing them to justice
[2:48:27.960 --> 2:48:29.960]  I just played clips of criminal investigations
[2:48:29.960 --> 2:48:31.960]  in the EU, your final comments
[2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:35.960]  well, this film
[2:48:35.960 --> 2:48:37.960]  now we have something that
[2:48:37.960 --> 2:48:39.960]  people can share
[2:48:39.960 --> 2:48:41.960]  and share with family members
[2:48:41.960 --> 2:48:43.960]  who did not agree
[2:48:43.960 --> 2:48:45.960]  with them before
[2:48:45.960 --> 2:48:47.960]  Bobby in the book
[2:48:47.960 --> 2:48:49.960]  put together a bullet proof case
[2:48:49.960 --> 2:48:51.960]  he's a brilliant trial lawyer
[2:48:51.960 --> 2:48:53.960]  and the case is there
[2:48:53.960 --> 2:48:55.960]  and so now we have
[2:48:55.960 --> 2:48:57.960]  something in a digestible format
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:48:59.960]  that people can share with their
[2:48:59.960 --> 2:49:01.960]  friends, their relatives, the people they work with
[2:49:01.960 --> 2:49:03.960]  and more importantly
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:05.960]  with public health officials
[2:49:05.960 --> 2:49:07.960]  who've been misled
[2:49:07.960 --> 2:49:09.960]  that are still making bad decisions
[2:49:09.960 --> 2:49:11.960]  based on bad information
[2:49:11.960 --> 2:49:13.960]  it's free
[2:49:13.960 --> 2:49:15.960]  by the way, it's free for the next nine days
[2:49:15.960 --> 2:49:17.960]  so we really made this easy
[2:49:17.960 --> 2:49:19.960]  for people to see
[2:49:19.960 --> 2:49:21.960]  oh, that was probably important to say
[2:49:21.960 --> 2:49:23.960]  because I didn't talk to you guys before you came on
[2:49:23.960 --> 2:49:25.960]  I don't make money to make, it takes a lot of money to make a film
[2:49:25.960 --> 2:49:27.960]  and I've seen the clips, it's incredible
[2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:29.960]  we're going to put this up front
[2:49:29.960 --> 2:49:31.960]  we're live right now, but we archive this at Band-Aid video
[2:49:31.960 --> 2:49:33.960]  I'm going to put this up front
[2:49:33.960 --> 2:49:35.960]  the film is free
[2:49:35.960 --> 2:49:37.960]  wow, tell us about that
[2:49:37.960 --> 2:49:39.960]  so this is
[2:49:39.960 --> 2:49:41.960]  the strategy we decided to use
[2:49:41.960 --> 2:49:43.960]  a percentage of the people
[2:49:43.960 --> 2:49:45.960]  that watched the whole film for free
[2:49:45.960 --> 2:49:47.960]  we used to buy it
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:49.960]  and we just decided to trust the people
[2:49:49.960 --> 2:49:51.960]  and it's a paradox
[2:49:51.960 --> 2:49:53.960]  hopefully the more we give away
[2:49:53.960 --> 2:49:55.960]  the more money we make
[2:49:55.960 --> 2:49:57.960]  if people like it and want to put it in their library
[2:49:57.960 --> 2:49:59.960]  they can buy it
[2:49:59.960 --> 2:50:01.960]  but for 10 days they can watch it for free
[2:50:01.960 --> 2:50:03.960]  and share it for free
[2:50:03.960 --> 2:50:05.960]  okay, well again
[2:50:05.960 --> 2:50:07.960]  I didn't talk to Tony or you beforehand
[2:50:07.960 --> 2:50:09.960]  I saw you guys on Steve Bannon
[2:50:09.960 --> 2:50:11.960]  said I don't want to get you on a few days ago
[2:50:11.960 --> 2:50:13.960]  you came on, so like I said
[2:50:13.960 --> 2:50:15.960]  I'm surprised, I don't know how you're going to pay for a film
[2:50:15.960 --> 2:50:17.960]  this good
[2:50:17.960 --> 2:50:19.960]  but perfect, oh wow
[2:50:19.960 --> 2:50:21.960]  that's going to make it even bigger
[2:50:21.960 --> 2:50:23.960]  listeners, you better go get it
[2:50:23.960 --> 2:50:25.960]  you better have viewing parties, you better share it
[2:50:25.960 --> 2:50:27.960]  you better support it, start over again
[2:50:27.960 --> 2:50:29.960]  the movie is free
[2:50:29.960 --> 2:50:31.960]  incredible Jeff A's
[2:50:31.960 --> 2:50:33.960]  tell us how we find it
[2:50:33.960 --> 2:50:35.960]  TheRealAnthonyFouchyMovie.com
[2:50:37.960 --> 2:50:39.960]  TheRealAnthonyFouchyMovie.com
[2:50:39.960 --> 2:50:41.960]  and for how many days
[2:50:41.960 --> 2:50:43.960]  is it free?
[2:50:43.960 --> 2:50:45.960]  so nine more days
[2:50:45.960 --> 2:50:47.960]  and again
[2:50:47.960 --> 2:50:49.960]  we're having to move it around
[2:50:49.960 --> 2:50:51.960]  just to keep it up for free for nine days
[2:50:51.960 --> 2:50:53.960]  one of our editors sent us a clip
[2:50:53.960 --> 2:50:55.960]  for us to review a month ago
[2:50:55.960 --> 2:50:57.960]  of his work on a section of the film
[2:50:57.960 --> 2:50:59.960]  put it on his private YouTube page
[2:50:59.960 --> 2:51:01.960]  non-public facing
[2:51:01.960 --> 2:51:03.960]  password protected
[2:51:03.960 --> 2:51:05.960]  and YouTube took it off of his private page
[2:51:05.960 --> 2:51:07.960]  for violating their content policy
[2:51:07.960 --> 2:51:09.960]  so this is not easy
[2:51:09.960 --> 2:51:11.960]  I like the way you think
[2:51:11.960 --> 2:51:13.960]  and so you already had my support
[2:51:13.960 --> 2:51:15.960]  and quite frankly I said
[2:51:15.960 --> 2:51:17.960]  hey you guys ought to sponsor run ads
[2:51:17.960 --> 2:51:19.960]  but I want to promote your film regardless
[2:51:19.960 --> 2:51:21.960]  I didn't know you were giving away for free
[2:51:21.960 --> 2:51:23.960]  because I've seen the trailers
[2:51:23.960 --> 2:51:25.960]  they are like HBO quality
[2:51:25.960 --> 2:51:27.960]  I read his book
[2:51:27.960 --> 2:51:29.960]  six months ago
[2:51:29.960 --> 2:51:31.960]  gave me a headache because I knew most of it didn't know some of it
[2:51:31.960 --> 2:51:33.960]  and it was just so scary
[2:51:33.960 --> 2:51:35.960]  600 pages of truth
[2:51:35.960 --> 2:51:37.960]  but it's in a film that's so easy to watch
[2:51:37.960 --> 2:51:39.960]  this is literally the antidote to these vampires
[2:51:39.960 --> 2:51:41.960]  everyone
[2:51:41.960 --> 2:51:43.960]  must go to therealanthonyfalchimovie.com
[2:51:43.960 --> 2:51:45.960]  and then you get it for free
[2:51:45.960 --> 2:51:47.960]  that is incredible
[2:51:49.960 --> 2:51:51.960]  this I think is the only way
[2:51:51.960 --> 2:51:53.960]  to get a film like this out there
[2:51:55.960 --> 2:51:57.960]  we joked with Steve Bannon
[2:51:57.960 --> 2:51:59.960]  what film festival is this going to be at
[2:51:59.960 --> 2:52:01.960]  and obviously it's not going to be at any film festival
[2:52:01.960 --> 2:52:03.960]  Amazon
[2:52:03.960 --> 2:52:05.960]  won't let us carry it in any format
[2:52:05.960 --> 2:52:07.960]  even a thumb drive
[2:52:07.960 --> 2:52:09.960]  even in trying to do
[2:52:09.960 --> 2:52:11.960]  public screenings
[2:52:11.960 --> 2:52:13.960]  these are so difficult to do
[2:52:13.960 --> 2:52:15.960]  because they'll have protesters
[2:52:15.960 --> 2:52:17.960]  show up that sometimes outnumber the people
[2:52:17.960 --> 2:52:19.960]  that are trying to see this
[2:52:19.960 --> 2:52:21.960]  well that's because if this comes out they all go to prison
[2:52:21.960 --> 2:52:23.960]  and the nightmare stops of hitler 2.0
[2:52:23.960 --> 2:52:25.960]  wow
[2:52:25.960 --> 2:52:27.960]  well I'm so honored Jeff Hayes be associated with you
[2:52:27.960 --> 2:52:29.960]  your film is obviously incredibly powerful
[2:52:29.960 --> 2:52:31.960]  wow
[2:52:31.960 --> 2:52:33.960]  Tony Lyons
[2:52:33.960 --> 2:52:35.960]  you've been around for decades
[2:52:35.960 --> 2:52:37.960]  interviewed for 20 years
[2:52:37.960 --> 2:52:39.960]  you're the top independent publisher in the country
[2:52:39.960 --> 2:52:41.960]  you got to feel really proud at a bone level
[2:52:41.960 --> 2:52:43.960]  a gut level right now what you're involved in
[2:52:43.960 --> 2:52:45.960]  I mean I'm serious
[2:52:45.960 --> 2:52:47.960]  I don't care about basketball stars, football stars, movie stars
[2:52:47.960 --> 2:52:49.960]  but let me tell you when I see somebody
[2:52:49.960 --> 2:52:51.960]  like Jeff or like you
[2:52:51.960 --> 2:52:53.960]  or like
[2:52:53.960 --> 2:52:55.960]  RFK Junior
[2:52:55.960 --> 2:52:57.960]  you guys are kicking ass man
[2:52:57.960 --> 2:52:59.960]  thank you so much for what you're doing
[2:52:59.960 --> 2:53:01.960]  yeah I am so proud to be working
[2:53:01.960 --> 2:53:03.960]  with Jeff Hayes and Robert F. Kennedy Junior
[2:53:03.960 --> 2:53:05.960]  to get this story out
[2:53:05.960 --> 2:53:07.960]  I mean people have to
[2:53:07.960 --> 2:53:09.960]  recognize that freedom of speech
[2:53:09.960 --> 2:53:11.960]  is the most important freedom
[2:53:11.960 --> 2:53:13.960]  in this country you have to be able
[2:53:13.960 --> 2:53:15.960]  to question authority
[2:53:15.960 --> 2:53:17.960]  and the things that have gone on in this country
[2:53:17.960 --> 2:53:19.960]  over the last couple of years
[2:53:19.960 --> 2:53:21.960]  have been so incredibly
[2:53:21.960 --> 2:53:23.960]  wrong and they've
[2:53:23.960 --> 2:53:25.960]  impinged on every freedom
[2:53:25.960 --> 2:53:27.960]  we've had and we need to strike back
[2:53:27.960 --> 2:53:29.960]  people need to watch this
[2:53:29.960 --> 2:53:31.960]  movie have their eyes open
[2:53:31.960 --> 2:53:33.960]  waken up
[2:53:33.960 --> 2:53:35.960]  to what's happening and share it
[2:53:35.960 --> 2:53:37.960]  as much as they can the real Anthony Fauci
[2:53:37.960 --> 2:53:39.960]  movie available

[2:53:41.960 --> 2:53:43.960]  it's the most
[2:53:43.960 --> 2:53:45.960]  important movie you will see this year
[2:53:47.960 --> 2:53:49.960]  well I'm just impressed with
[2:53:49.960 --> 2:53:51.960]  what you guys have done and
[2:53:51.960 --> 2:53:53.960]  what a great patriot Robert
[2:53:53.960 --> 2:53:55.960]  F. Kennedy Junior is
[2:53:55.960 --> 2:53:57.960]  his uncle was great his father was amazing
[2:53:57.960 --> 2:53:59.960]  and killed by the deep state
[2:53:59.960 --> 2:54:01.960]  and now there is the sun continuing to fight on
[2:54:01.960 --> 2:54:03.960]  this is such important work
[2:54:03.960 --> 2:54:05.960]  wow well gentlemen I salute
[2:54:05.960 --> 2:54:07.960]  you and I thank you when is it available
[2:54:07.960 --> 2:54:09.960]  for sale because we're not
[2:54:09.960 --> 2:54:11.960]  communists here we realize it takes money to fight
[2:54:11.960 --> 2:54:13.960]  how do people support what you've done Jeff Hayes
[2:54:13.960 --> 2:54:15.960]  they can watch it for
[2:54:15.960 --> 2:54:17.960]  free and if they find it
[2:54:17.960 --> 2:54:19.960]  valuable they can buy it on the
[2:54:19.960 --> 2:54:21.960]  page but nobody has
[2:54:21.960 --> 2:54:23.960]  to pay to see it for the next 10 days
[2:54:23.960 --> 2:54:25.960]  but they're welcome to
[2:54:25.960 --> 2:54:27.960]  and literally we already have
[2:54:27.960 --> 2:54:29.960]  tens of thousands of people that have bought
[2:54:29.960 --> 2:54:31.960]  it so this is
[2:54:31.960 --> 2:54:33.960]  going to be fine I you know
[2:54:33.960 --> 2:54:35.960]  I was losing sleep as I was moving toward
[2:54:35.960 --> 2:54:37.960]  this this was a significant
[2:54:37.960 --> 2:54:39.960]  budget to make this film
[2:54:39.960 --> 2:54:41.960]  and I financed it internally
[2:54:41.960 --> 2:54:43.960]  through my own company
[2:54:43.960 --> 2:54:45.960]  and it's you know it was a gutsy
[2:54:45.960 --> 2:54:47.960]  move and already in the first
[2:54:47.960 --> 2:54:49.960]  day we're going to be fine
[2:54:49.960 --> 2:54:51.960]  it's exactly
[2:54:51.960 --> 2:54:53.960]  we commit God comes through to the people
[2:54:53.960 --> 2:54:55.960]  I got tears in my eyes
[2:54:55.960 --> 2:54:57.960]  Jeff Hayes thank you so much I love you

[2:55:19.960 --> 2:55:21.960]  and I didn't wage this war against
[2:55:21.960 --> 2:55:23.960]  them because I think we're going to lose

[3:00:13.960 --> 3:00:25.960]  So they say you know a man by his enemies
[3:00:25.960 --> 3:00:27.960]  and you know a man by his friends
[3:00:27.960 --> 3:00:29.960]  and we knew Bloomberg was involved
[3:00:29.960 --> 3:00:31.960]  we knew Soros was involved
[3:00:31.960 --> 3:00:33.960]  we know the establishment was involved
[3:00:33.960 --> 3:00:35.960]  Trump shut us down
[3:00:35.960 --> 3:00:37.960]  making up stuff about Sandy Hook
[3:00:37.960 --> 3:00:39.960]  lying about us making this huge issue
[3:00:39.960 --> 3:00:41.960]  on every single issue
[3:00:41.960 --> 3:00:43.960]  on this huge issue
[3:00:43.960 --> 3:00:45.960]  on every news channel every TV station
[3:00:45.960 --> 3:00:47.960]  for four years
[3:00:47.960 --> 3:00:49.960]  so they could try to drive the stake
[3:00:49.960 --> 3:00:51.960]  of the heart of the First Amendment
[3:00:51.960 --> 3:00:53.960]  but now prweek.com reports
[3:00:53.960 --> 3:00:55.960]  Berlin Rosen
[3:00:55.960 --> 3:00:57.960]  which is fun about Bloomberg
[3:00:57.960 --> 3:00:59.960]  com strategy
[3:00:59.960 --> 3:01:01.960]  behind Sandy Hook family's victory over Alex Jones
[3:01:01.960 --> 3:01:03.960]  they meant it was all a giant
[3:01:03.960 --> 3:01:05.960]  PR operation
[3:01:05.960 --> 3:01:07.960]  Berlin Rosen
[3:01:07.960 --> 3:01:09.960]  secures investment from equity firm
[3:01:09.960 --> 3:01:11.960]  O2 investment
[3:01:11.960 --> 3:01:13.960]  about Berlin Rosen
[3:01:13.960 --> 3:01:15.960]  how they ran the Alex Jones attack
[3:01:15.960 --> 3:01:17.960]  and the PR
[3:01:17.960 --> 3:01:19.960]  we already knew Bloomberg funded it
[3:01:19.960 --> 3:01:21.960]  we already knew that was happening
[3:01:21.960 --> 3:01:23.960]  but they made Sandy Hook a big deal
[3:01:23.960 --> 3:01:25.960]  they made it a huge fundraiser issue for themselves
[3:01:25.960 --> 3:01:27.960]  by attaching it to me from a few comments I made
[3:01:27.960 --> 3:01:29.960]  then they had the judge find me
[3:01:29.960 --> 3:01:31.960]  guilty and have the jury decide how guilty
[3:01:31.960 --> 3:01:33.960]  and they think now I just go oh
[3:01:33.960 --> 3:01:35.960]  I'm rolling over now
[3:01:35.960 --> 3:01:37.960]  you said I'm guilty
[3:01:37.960 --> 3:01:39.960]  I'm going away
[3:01:39.960 --> 3:01:41.960]  the opposite
[3:01:41.960 --> 3:01:43.960]  is now happening
[3:01:43.960 --> 3:01:45.960]  we are igniting the fires of liberty
[3:01:45.960 --> 3:01:47.960]  and we are going to the next level
[3:01:47.960 --> 3:01:49.960]  and we are not
[3:01:49.960 --> 3:01:51.960]  backing down
[3:01:51.960 --> 3:01:53.960]  one tenth of one percent in fact
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:01:55.960]  we're going to intensify
[3:01:55.960 --> 3:01:57.960]  everything we've been doing thanks to your support
[3:01:57.960 --> 3:01:59.960]  and your prayers and the number one thing I ask
[3:01:59.960 --> 3:02:01.960]  listeners and viewers to do and I mean this
[3:02:01.960 --> 3:02:03.960]  is prayer pray for info wars
[3:02:03.960 --> 3:02:05.960]  pray for discernment pray for providence
[3:02:05.960 --> 3:02:07.960]  and pray for our victory collectively
[3:02:07.960 --> 3:02:09.960]  together against this evil
[3:02:09.960 --> 3:02:11.960]  and realize we have a strategy
[3:02:11.960 --> 3:02:13.960]  to defeat the enemy
[3:02:13.960 --> 3:02:15.960]  the enemy is failing on every front
[3:02:15.960 --> 3:02:17.960]  and they may have their whole corporate media
[3:02:17.960 --> 3:02:19.960]  their dinosaur media but the public doesn't believe
[3:02:19.960 --> 3:02:21.960]  what they say
[3:02:21.960 --> 3:02:23.960]  yeah they can rig a court case
[3:02:23.960 --> 3:02:25.960]  whatever they want but at the end of the day
[3:02:25.960 --> 3:02:27.960]  as long as we keep persevering
[3:02:27.960 --> 3:02:29.960]  the new world order will
[3:02:29.960 --> 3:02:31.960]  fail
[3:02:31.960 --> 3:02:33.960]  and that's what this comes down to
[3:02:33.960 --> 3:02:35.960]  they want to make you hopeless
[3:02:35.960 --> 3:02:37.960]  they want to make you think you're defeated
[3:02:37.960 --> 3:02:39.960]  because you got a broken car or don't have money for bills
[3:02:39.960 --> 3:02:41.960]  you are made by God
[3:02:41.960 --> 3:02:43.960]  you're beautiful
[3:02:43.960 --> 3:02:45.960]  no matter whether your skin is black or brown or pink
[3:02:45.960 --> 3:02:47.960]  or white or speckled
[3:02:47.960 --> 3:02:49.960]  it doesn't matter
[3:02:49.960 --> 3:02:51.960]  God made you and the fact that you love God
[3:02:51.960 --> 3:02:53.960]  and the fact that you love justice
[3:02:53.960 --> 3:02:55.960]  is that eternal connection
[3:02:55.960 --> 3:02:57.960]  and is the real value of who you are
[3:02:57.960 --> 3:02:59.960]  you see the beauty of a sunset
[3:02:59.960 --> 3:03:01.960]  or a thunderstorm
[3:03:01.960 --> 3:03:03.960]  or your wife or your children
[3:03:03.960 --> 3:03:05.960]  and you care about people
[3:03:05.960 --> 3:03:07.960]  and you want to be a good person
[3:03:07.960 --> 3:03:09.960]  and you want to be constructive
[3:03:09.960 --> 3:03:11.960]  that's a beautiful thing
[3:03:11.960 --> 3:03:13.960]  and the left is anti-human
[3:03:13.960 --> 3:03:15.960]  wants to abort our babies
[3:03:15.960 --> 3:03:17.960]  wants to have drag queen story time
[3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:19.960]  wants to sexualize who we are
[3:03:19.960 --> 3:03:21.960]  wants to destroy our innocence
[3:03:21.960 --> 3:03:23.960]  and they have failed
[3:03:23.960 --> 3:03:25.960]  the world is in the process
[3:03:25.960 --> 3:03:27.960]  of being taken away from these monsters
[3:03:27.960 --> 3:03:29.960]  and their theater
[3:03:29.960 --> 3:03:31.960]  and so that's where we stand together
[3:03:31.960 --> 3:03:33.960]  in history not perfect
[3:03:33.960 --> 3:03:35.960]  but loving God
[3:03:35.960 --> 3:03:37.960]  and trying to build a better world
[3:03:37.960 --> 3:03:39.960]  and that separates us
[3:03:39.960 --> 3:03:41.960]  from these parasites
[3:03:41.960 --> 3:03:43.960]  that no human psychology
[3:03:43.960 --> 3:03:45.960]  but use it against the people
[3:03:45.960 --> 3:03:47.960]  we know the psychology they use
[3:03:47.960 --> 3:03:49.960]  and try to show people the trick that's being used
[3:03:49.960 --> 3:03:51.960]  to get them to stand up on their own
[3:03:51.960 --> 3:03:53.960]  and not be controllable
[3:03:53.960 --> 3:03:55.960]  and that my friends
[3:03:55.960 --> 3:03:57.960]  separates
[3:03:57.960 --> 3:03:59.960]  from either God or the devil
[3:03:59.960 --> 3:04:01.960]  and you're going to have to decide
[3:04:01.960 --> 3:04:03.960]  which side you're on
[3:04:03.960 --> 3:04:05.960]  Kate Dowley, great syndicated talk show host
[3:04:05.960 --> 3:04:07.960]  is about to take over, she's always amazing
[3:04:07.960 --> 3:04:09.960]  and then in 55 minutes
[3:04:09.960 --> 3:04:11.960]  the great Owen
[3:04:11.960 --> 3:04:13.960]  Cuck the destroyer
[3:04:13.960 --> 3:04:15.960]  will be taking over
[3:04:15.960 --> 3:04:17.960]  3-6pm and then I've been in long wars
[3:04:17.960 --> 3:04:19.960]  despite the fact there's 20 days
[3:04:19.960 --> 3:04:21.960]  to the midterms
[3:04:21.960 --> 3:04:23.960]  I need to go into dry dock
[3:04:23.960 --> 3:04:25.960]  I need to go ahead and settle down
[3:04:25.960 --> 3:04:27.960]  but I'll be back soon
[3:04:27.960 --> 3:04:29.960]  but I'm going to sign off now
[3:04:29.960 --> 3:04:31.960]  for a civil future
[3:04:31.960 --> 3:04:33.960]  and thank you all for keeping me
[3:04:33.960 --> 3:04:35.960]  in the attack, in the fight
[3:04:35.960 --> 3:04:37.960]  all of our success
[3:04:37.960 --> 3:04:39.960]  which is epic
[3:04:39.960 --> 3:04:41.960]  goes directly to you
[3:04:41.960 --> 3:04:43.960]  I know you don't want the credit
[3:04:43.960 --> 3:04:45.960]  but you need to know it's you
[3:04:45.960 --> 3:04:47.960]  that have supported liberty
[3:04:47.960 --> 3:04:49.960]  that allowed us to do this together
[3:04:49.960 --> 3:04:51.960]  so for that I salute you and thank you
[3:04:51.960 --> 3:04:53.960]  from the bottom of my heart
[3:04:53.960 --> 3:04:55.960]  and I'll see you next time
[3:05:23.960 --> 3:05:25.960]  the info war
[3:05:25.960 --> 3:05:27.960]  so many of you are on the fence
[3:05:27.960 --> 3:05:29.960]  you know our information is powerful

[3:06:01.960 --> 3:06:03.960]  I welcome back to the alex jones show
[3:06:03.960 --> 3:06:05.960]  so happy to be here and Kate Daly
[3:06:05.960 --> 3:06:07.960]  your guest host from KateDalyRadio.com
[3:06:07.960 --> 3:06:09.960]  you know the big headline today
[3:06:09.960 --> 3:06:11.960]  not the biggest one
[3:06:11.960 --> 3:06:13.960]  cockatoos are getting smarter
[3:06:13.960 --> 3:06:15.960]  should humans be worried?
[3:06:15.960 --> 3:06:17.960]  Wall Street Journal actually put that out
[3:06:17.960 --> 3:06:19.960]  I'm gonna have to say yes it wouldn't take much
[3:06:19.960 --> 3:06:21.960]  to be smarter than the average American
[3:06:21.960 --> 3:06:23.960]  a slug is smarter than the average American
[3:06:23.960 --> 3:06:25.960]  right now
[3:06:25.960 --> 3:06:27.960]  the midterms I just wanted to say real quick
[3:06:27.960 --> 3:06:29.960]  before I bring on my amazing guest Dr. Lee Merritt
[3:06:29.960 --> 3:06:31.960]  I just wanted to say
[3:06:31.960 --> 3:06:33.960]  they keep spinning the midterms
[3:06:33.960 --> 3:06:35.960]  as razor thin
[3:06:35.960 --> 3:06:37.960]  it's mathematically impossible in America
[3:06:37.960 --> 3:06:39.960]  the conservatives have still the majority
[3:06:39.960 --> 3:06:41.960]  in America so I don't believe it for a moment
[3:06:41.960 --> 3:06:43.960]  but they're trying to do that
[3:06:43.960 --> 3:06:45.960]  so they can gauge up the
[3:06:45.960 --> 3:06:47.960]  election fraud so that you'll believe it
[3:06:47.960 --> 3:06:49.960]  because you'll think it's razor thin
[3:06:49.960 --> 3:06:51.960]  just like McMuffin
[3:06:51.960 --> 3:06:53.960]  breakfast sandwich we call him
[3:06:53.960 --> 3:06:55.960]  and he's running against Mike Lee
[3:06:55.960 --> 3:06:57.960]  it's not a tight race
[3:06:57.960 --> 3:06:59.960]  Mike Lee will take it of course
[3:06:59.960 --> 3:07:01.960]  and McMuffin is a liar
[3:07:01.960 --> 3:07:03.960]  he's always been a liar
[3:07:03.960 --> 3:07:05.960]  always will be a liar doesn't even know what he stands for
[3:07:05.960 --> 3:07:07.960]  and he's supported by so many leftist groups
[3:07:07.960 --> 3:07:09.960]  that it's just
[3:07:09.960 --> 3:07:11.960]  it's pathetic and so he's a scumbag
[3:07:11.960 --> 3:07:13.960]  what can you say?
[3:07:13.960 --> 3:07:15.960]  so you know I would definitely not believe
[3:07:15.960 --> 3:07:17.960]  the midterms are razor thin
[3:07:17.960 --> 3:07:19.960]  and start calling the media on this
[3:07:19.960 --> 3:07:21.960]  because we know they're not
[3:07:21.960 --> 3:07:23.960]  look I've got the most amazing guest
[3:07:23.960 --> 3:07:25.960]  of course I love Dr. Lee Merritt
[3:07:25.960 --> 3:07:27.960]  I love to bring her on because
[3:07:27.960 --> 3:07:29.960]  let me just tell you she's a fountain of knowledge
[3:07:29.960 --> 3:07:31.960]  every time I bring her on I'm learning something new
[3:07:31.960 --> 3:07:33.960]  I know you guys must be learning something
[3:07:33.960 --> 3:07:35.960]  from her and usually a volume of things
[3:07:35.960 --> 3:07:37.960]  Dr. Merritt has been in private practice
[3:07:37.960 --> 3:07:39.960]  of orthopedic and spine surgery
[3:07:39.960 --> 3:07:41.960]  since 1995 and is the past president
[3:07:41.960 --> 3:07:43.960]  of the Association of American Physicians
[3:07:43.960 --> 3:07:45.960]  and Surgeons
[3:07:45.960 --> 3:07:47.960]  and as a lifelong advocate of free market
[3:07:47.960 --> 3:07:49.960]  patient centered medicine
[3:07:49.960 --> 3:07:51.960]  she actually had the opportunity
[3:07:51.960 --> 3:07:53.960]  a long time ago to go on the John Stossel
[3:07:53.960 --> 3:07:55.960]  show and fight Obamacare
[3:07:55.960 --> 3:07:57.960]  and I'm so glad she did that
[3:07:57.960 --> 3:07:59.960]  and of course her recent check out her recent youtube
[3:07:59.960 --> 3:08:01.960]  on doctors for disaster preparedness
[3:08:01.960 --> 3:08:03.960]  SARS-CoV-2 and the rise of medical
[3:08:03.960 --> 3:08:05.960]  technocracy it's fantastic
[3:08:05.960 --> 3:08:07.960]  and then also themedicalrebel.com
[3:08:07.960 --> 3:08:09.960]  themedicalrebel.com
[3:08:09.960 --> 3:08:11.960]  you can go there
[3:08:11.960 --> 3:08:13.960]  join her sub-stack
[3:08:13.960 --> 3:08:15.960]  she reveals so much on her sub-stack
[3:08:15.960 --> 3:08:17.960]  Dr. Merritt so glad
[3:08:17.960 --> 3:08:19.960]  to have you with us
[3:08:19.960 --> 3:08:21.960]  because I cannot wait to pick your brain today
[3:08:21.960 --> 3:08:23.960]  how are you?
[3:08:23.960 --> 3:08:25.960]  nice to see you Kate
[3:08:25.960 --> 3:08:27.960]  I have to warn your listeners
[3:08:27.960 --> 3:08:29.960]  I was demonetized from sub-stack
[3:08:29.960 --> 3:08:31.960]  I'm the only person I know who was
[3:08:31.960 --> 3:08:33.960]  so I've moved it on to my website
[3:08:33.960 --> 3:08:35.960]  themedicalrebel.com
[3:08:35.960 --> 3:08:37.960]  so you can find it there
[3:08:37.960 --> 3:08:39.960]  you just go up and when you click in
[3:08:39.960 --> 3:08:41.960]  you can find all the stuff
[3:08:41.960 --> 3:08:43.960]  they're doing this to everybody
[3:08:43.960 --> 3:08:45.960]  I mean the outrage
[3:08:45.960 --> 3:08:47.960]  we should be having
[3:08:47.960 --> 3:08:49.960]  all of this censorship is insane
[3:08:49.960 --> 3:08:51.960]  I just can't believe it
[3:08:51.960 --> 3:08:53.960]  I think we're deer in a headlight
[3:08:53.960 --> 3:08:55.960]  it feels that way still
[3:08:55.960 --> 3:08:57.960]  I think though
[3:08:57.960 --> 3:08:59.960]  that they're desperate
[3:08:59.960 --> 3:09:01.960]  because I think we're smarter than they thought
[3:09:01.960 --> 3:09:03.960]  we were
[3:09:03.960 --> 3:09:05.960]  I think actually
[3:09:05.960 --> 3:09:07.960]  human beings are actually going to take this back
[3:09:07.960 --> 3:09:09.960]  humanity first
[3:09:09.960 --> 3:09:11.960]  we're actually smarter than they gave us credit for
[3:09:11.960 --> 3:09:13.960]  and we're figuring a lot of stuff out
[3:09:13.960 --> 3:09:15.960]  and so that's why
[3:09:15.960 --> 3:09:17.960]  there's a lot of fear
[3:09:17.960 --> 3:09:19.960]  mongering
[3:09:19.960 --> 3:09:21.960]  this idea of nuclear weapons
[3:09:21.960 --> 3:09:23.960]  I shared you that
[3:09:23.960 --> 3:09:25.960]  why you're not going to be doing nuclear weapons
[3:09:25.960 --> 3:09:27.960]  essentially in a world
[3:09:27.960 --> 3:09:29.960]  when you have scalar weapons
[3:09:29.960 --> 3:09:31.960]  Putin's not going to
[3:09:31.960 --> 3:09:33.960]  I said to my car dealer
[3:09:33.960 --> 3:09:35.960]  a friend of mine
[3:09:35.960 --> 3:09:37.960]  if a nuclear weapon
[3:09:37.960 --> 3:09:39.960]  if Putin throws a nuclear weapon
[3:09:39.960 --> 3:09:41.960]  out there
[3:09:41.960 --> 3:09:43.960]  I'm going to eat my sports car
[3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:45.960]  piece by piece
[3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:47.960]  there's zero chance of that
[3:09:47.960 --> 3:09:49.960]  now we could do it
[3:09:49.960 --> 3:09:51.960]  unfortunately nato might throw a nuclear weapon
[3:09:51.960 --> 3:09:53.960]  out there to make him the guilty
[3:09:53.960 --> 3:09:55.960]  to try and blame it
[3:09:55.960 --> 3:09:57.960]  the only person that would throw out a nuke right now
[3:09:57.960 --> 3:09:59.960]  is somebody that wants to make a false flag
[3:09:59.960 --> 3:10:01.960]  against somebody else
[3:10:01.960 --> 3:10:03.960]  this is just a lot of fear
[3:10:03.960 --> 3:10:05.960]  the coronavirus
[3:10:05.960 --> 3:10:07.960]  far as covid 2 is now 80% fatal
[3:10:07.960 --> 3:10:09.960]  don't buy into this
[3:10:09.960 --> 3:10:11.960]  don't get a monkey pox
[3:10:11.960 --> 3:10:13.960]  they just can't
[3:10:13.960 --> 3:10:15.960]  they keep coming up with more stuff all the time
[3:10:15.960 --> 3:10:17.960]  they're bringing back the variants
[3:10:17.960 --> 3:10:19.960]  I used to tell people
[3:10:19.960 --> 3:10:21.960]  when moronic came into view
[3:10:21.960 --> 3:10:23.960]  I said go to the hospital and test for delta
[3:10:23.960 --> 3:10:25.960]  just to see their face drop
[3:10:25.960 --> 3:10:27.960]  they won't know what to do
[3:10:27.960 --> 3:10:29.960]  now they're bringing back these variants
[3:10:29.960 --> 3:10:31.960]  you must just be laughing
[3:10:31.960 --> 3:10:33.960]  this is absolutely ridiculous
[3:10:33.960 --> 3:10:35.960]  a variant that strikes the world for a month
[3:10:35.960 --> 3:10:37.960]  I mean
[3:10:37.960 --> 3:10:39.960]  I don't know
[3:10:39.960 --> 3:10:41.960]  we're less than a cockatoo
[3:10:41.960 --> 3:10:43.960]  for sure
[3:10:43.960 --> 3:10:45.960]  maybe a slug at this point
[3:10:45.960 --> 3:10:47.960]  but I don't think a lot of people are believing it
[3:10:47.960 --> 3:10:49.960]  the other thing is
[3:10:49.960 --> 3:10:51.960]  and this again
[3:10:51.960 --> 3:10:53.960]  people want to say this is all conspiracy theory
[3:10:53.960 --> 3:10:55.960]  which is why on my website I had that
[3:10:55.960 --> 3:10:57.960]  point about how you get your news
[3:10:57.960 --> 3:10:59.960]  sheep just sit back and listen to CNN
[3:10:59.960 --> 3:11:01.960]  or something
[3:11:01.960 --> 3:11:03.960]  wolves go search the news
[3:11:03.960 --> 3:11:05.960]  you are awesome at doing that sort of thing
[3:11:07.960 --> 3:11:09.960]  if you really look around at the world
[3:11:09.960 --> 3:11:11.960]  it is true there are islands off Antarctica
[3:11:11.960 --> 3:11:13.960]  that are named delta and omicron
[3:11:13.960 --> 3:11:15.960]  they're owned by the Rothschilds
[3:11:15.960 --> 3:11:17.960]  go look it up
[3:11:17.960 --> 3:11:19.960]  they love symbols
[3:11:19.960 --> 3:11:21.960]  my point is this is all symbolic
[3:11:21.960 --> 3:11:23.960]  and fear mongering
[3:11:23.960 --> 3:11:25.960]  and everything they do
[3:11:25.960 --> 3:11:27.960]  is to divide us
[3:11:27.960 --> 3:11:29.960]  keep us afraid
[3:11:29.960 --> 3:11:31.960]  and keep us separated
[3:11:31.960 --> 3:11:33.960]  if there's an answer here
[3:11:33.960 --> 3:11:35.960]  do not be separated from your fellow man
[3:11:35.960 --> 3:11:37.960]  and do not be afraid
[3:11:37.960 --> 3:11:39.960]  go forth and prosper
[3:11:39.960 --> 3:11:41.960]  and fight the good fight
[3:11:41.960 --> 3:11:43.960]  love this
[3:11:43.960 --> 3:11:45.960]  there's so much news
[3:11:45.960 --> 3:11:47.960]  I think people are getting a little strangled
[3:11:47.960 --> 3:11:49.960]  by all of the news coming out about
[3:11:49.960 --> 3:11:51.960]  vaccines and all of the dangers
[3:11:51.960 --> 3:11:53.960]  the deaths
[3:11:53.960 --> 3:11:55.960]  the sudden adult death syndrome
[3:11:55.960 --> 3:11:57.960]  I just wanted you to comment on this
[3:11:57.960 --> 3:11:59.960]  because one of the big headlines was
[3:11:59.960 --> 3:12:01.960]  the court ordered the CDC of course
[3:12:01.960 --> 3:12:03.960]  Dell did a great job on this
[3:12:03.960 --> 3:12:05.960]  to release the data indicating 18 million
[3:12:05.960 --> 3:12:07.960]  vaccine injuries in America
[3:12:07.960 --> 3:12:09.960]  and so they're finally having to release this
[3:12:09.960 --> 3:12:11.960]  by a court order because they refuse to
[3:12:11.960 --> 3:12:13.960]  that should tell people volumes
[3:12:13.960 --> 3:12:15.960]  but just the latest
[3:12:15.960 --> 3:12:17.960]  what is your perspective on the latest coming out
[3:12:17.960 --> 3:12:19.960]  okay well it's grim
[3:12:19.960 --> 3:12:21.960]  I mean the numbers are grim
[3:12:21.960 --> 3:12:23.960]  and what we've been seeing is grim
[3:12:23.960 --> 3:12:25.960]  dropping over
[3:12:25.960 --> 3:12:27.960]  and I'd like to
[3:12:27.960 --> 3:12:29.960]  maybe after the break I'll talk about the soccer numbers
[3:12:29.960 --> 3:12:31.960]  I have about soccer players and deaths
[3:12:31.960 --> 3:12:33.960]  because I did a little research on that
[3:12:33.960 --> 3:12:35.960]  but here's the point I'm going to say
[3:12:35.960 --> 3:12:37.960]  first of all
[3:12:37.960 --> 3:12:39.960]  if you're listening to this and you've been vaccinated
[3:12:39.960 --> 3:12:41.960]  they've been
[3:12:41.960 --> 3:12:43.960]  steering the conversation
[3:12:43.960 --> 3:12:45.960]  away from anything
[3:12:45.960 --> 3:12:47.960]  other than mRNA
[3:12:47.960 --> 3:12:49.960]  and they made it sound like
[3:12:49.960 --> 3:12:51.960]  we can't do anything about your vaccine
[3:12:51.960 --> 3:12:53.960]  injuries because it's all mRNA
[3:12:53.960 --> 3:12:55.960]  it got into your DNA and you're just
[3:12:55.960 --> 3:12:57.960]  you're just hosed and we don't know what to do
[3:12:57.960 --> 3:12:59.960]  that is not true again I think that is
[3:12:59.960 --> 3:13:01.960]  another of this fear tactics
[3:13:01.960 --> 3:13:03.960]  and I think that now
[3:13:03.960 --> 3:13:05.960]  through a combination of data from
[3:13:05.960 --> 3:13:07.960]  Celeste Solom and Karen Kingston
[3:13:07.960 --> 3:13:09.960]  what she just came out with
[3:13:09.960 --> 3:13:11.960]  and Brian Artis and so many people
[3:13:11.960 --> 3:13:13.960]  we are finding things that we can do
[3:13:13.960 --> 3:13:15.960]  something about and I think we can take care
[3:13:15.960 --> 3:13:17.960]  I think we can probably do a lot of
[3:13:17.960 --> 3:13:19.960]  because
[3:13:19.960 --> 3:13:21.960]  we're not finding mRNA in these vaccines
[3:13:21.960 --> 3:13:23.960]  after it's all said and done
[3:13:23.960 --> 3:13:25.960]  there are 18 labs out there that are studying
[3:13:25.960 --> 3:13:27.960]  these vaccines from Sinovac
[3:13:27.960 --> 3:13:29.960]  to the Sputnik to AstraZeneca
[3:13:29.960 --> 3:13:31.960]  Moderna and what they are not
[3:13:31.960 --> 3:13:33.960]  finding is mRNA
[3:13:33.960 --> 3:13:35.960]  now when I said that to Karen
[3:13:35.960 --> 3:13:37.960]  Kingston a month or so ago
[3:13:37.960 --> 3:13:39.960]  I remember she said something like
[3:13:39.960 --> 3:13:41.960]  well maybe it's because the
[3:13:41.960 --> 3:13:43.960]  mRNA goes away it just dissipates
[3:13:43.960 --> 3:13:45.960]  if it isn't kept in cold
[3:13:45.960 --> 3:13:47.960]  after 10 weeks coming out of the cold storage
[3:13:47.960 --> 3:13:49.960]  I'm kind of
[3:13:49.960 --> 3:13:51.960]  and I told her I'm just
[3:13:51.960 --> 3:13:53.960]  raising my hand and I said
[3:13:53.960 --> 3:13:55.960]  I'm not really buying that
[3:13:55.960 --> 3:13:57.960]  that's like how can we not do
[3:13:57.960 --> 3:13:59.960]  do not watch CSI
[3:13:59.960 --> 3:14:01.960]  what's all that genetic studies on the dead bodies
[3:14:01.960 --> 3:14:03.960]  so there are things in there
[3:14:03.960 --> 3:14:05.960]  it's hydrogel and that's what she's come up with
[3:14:05.960 --> 3:14:07.960]  brilliant stuff she's come up with
[3:14:07.960 --> 3:14:09.960]  so hydrogel reduce
[3:14:09.960 --> 3:14:11.960]  graphene oxide and
[3:14:11.960 --> 3:14:13.960]  some metal fragment stuff and I think
[3:14:13.960 --> 3:14:15.960]  we have a way out of this
[3:14:15.960 --> 3:14:17.960]  OEMF that's another real bad part
[3:14:17.960 --> 3:14:19.960]  of this whole thing so that's what
[3:14:19.960 --> 3:14:21.960]  we need to talk about is how we get ourselves
[3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:23.960]  out of this and then how do we
[3:14:23.960 --> 3:14:25.960]  take our world back and you know I've said
[3:14:25.960 --> 3:14:27.960]  for a long time one of the ways we take
[3:14:27.960 --> 3:14:29.960]  our world back is changing our language
[3:14:29.960 --> 3:14:31.960]  we have to realize we've been lied to
[3:14:31.960 --> 3:14:33.960]  about basic physiology
[3:14:33.960 --> 3:14:35.960]  and medicine probably since
[3:14:35.960 --> 3:14:37.960]  1905 if not earlier
[3:14:37.960 --> 3:14:39.960]  but certainly since then the idea
[3:14:39.960 --> 3:14:41.960]  that we transmit disease
[3:14:41.960 --> 3:14:43.960]  to each other through these little anima
[3:14:43.960 --> 3:14:45.960]  cells that float out and make each other sick
[3:14:45.960 --> 3:14:47.960]  is a great anti-human agenda
[3:14:47.960 --> 3:14:49.960]  without proof
[3:14:49.960 --> 3:14:51.960]  without proof we have to go back in medicine
[3:14:51.960 --> 3:14:53.960]  and in biology and look at how
[3:14:53.960 --> 3:14:55.960]  did we prove these things and if you don't
[3:14:55.960 --> 3:14:57.960]  know how something was proved then it isn't
[3:14:57.960 --> 3:14:59.960]  proved until you figure out how it was proved
[3:14:59.960 --> 3:15:01.960]  100% Dr.
[3:15:01.960 --> 3:15:03.960]  Lee Merritt I'm with you
[3:15:03.960 --> 3:15:05.960]  and when we come back I have so many
[3:15:05.960 --> 3:15:07.960]  things I want to talk about with you even
[3:15:07.960 --> 3:15:09.960]  about that as well because yes
[3:15:09.960 --> 3:15:11.960]  the Rockefellers in the absence of finding
[3:15:11.960 --> 3:15:13.960]  bacteria back in 1905 actually
[3:15:13.960 --> 3:15:15.960]  declared this new thing
[3:15:15.960 --> 3:15:17.960]  called a virus and it was going to be
[3:15:17.960 --> 3:15:19.960]  invisible and it was going to be contagious
[3:15:19.960 --> 3:15:21.960]  and they changed history from then
[3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:23.960]  on by claiming that and you
[3:15:23.960 --> 3:15:25.960]  go back to the lie and the lie is bold
[3:15:25.960 --> 3:15:27.960]  and fierce and it's right there and
[3:15:27.960 --> 3:15:29.960]  I'm sorry you can't escape the facts
[3:15:29.960 --> 3:15:31.960]  that the Rockefellers
[3:15:31.960 --> 3:15:33.960]  and a good old Simon Flexner
[3:15:33.960 --> 3:15:35.960]  lied about the whole thing
[3:15:35.960 --> 3:15:37.960]  because they couldn't find what they were looking for
[3:15:37.960 --> 3:15:39.960]  you don't go and invent something
[3:15:39.960 --> 3:15:41.960]  and there was a definite purpose to it
[3:15:41.960 --> 3:15:43.960]  we'll be right back with Dr. Lee Merritt

[3:16:29.960 --> 3:16:31.960]  by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40%
[3:16:31.960 --> 3:16:33.960]  of the legal fees and I can't
[3:16:33.960 --> 3:16:35.960]  fund those myself it's unsustainable

[3:18:03.960 --> 3:18:05.960]  so I salute you and I thank you
[3:18:05.960 --> 3:18:07.960]  now you know about fluoride the bad halogen
[3:18:07.960 --> 3:18:09.960]  on the periodic table
[3:18:09.960 --> 3:18:11.960]  well high quality iodine is the good halogen
[3:18:11.960 --> 3:18:13.960]  and does the opposite of fluoride
[3:18:13.960 --> 3:18:15.960]  and when you've got it in your body
[3:18:15.960 --> 3:18:17.960]  it doesn't just supercharge your cells
[3:18:17.960 --> 3:18:19.960]  it doesn't just give you more energy
[3:18:19.960 --> 3:18:21.960]  but it also adds halogens
[3:18:21.960 --> 3:18:23.960]  in the fluoride chlorine bromide bromine family
[3:18:23.960 --> 3:18:25.960]  so ladies and gentlemen

[3:18:59.960 --> 3:19:01.960]  or a co-worker that's on drugs or alcohol
[3:19:01.960 --> 3:19:03.960]  and is in a bad place
[3:19:03.960 --> 3:19:05.960]  and they need family and friends to come to their aid
[3:19:05.960 --> 3:19:07.960]  and talk to them and get them into rehab
[3:19:07.960 --> 3:19:09.960]  well it's the same thing
[3:19:09.960 --> 3:19:11.960]  for America and the rest of the world
[3:19:11.960 --> 3:19:13.960]  when it comes to critical vitamins and minerals
[3:19:13.960 --> 3:19:15.960]  that your body must have to live
[3:19:15.960 --> 3:19:17.960]  and people don't listen
[3:19:17.960 --> 3:19:19.960]  and they don't supplement
[3:19:19.960 --> 3:19:21.960]  it's literally an intervention
[3:19:21.960 --> 3:19:23.960]  I lead an incredibly stressful life
[3:19:23.960 --> 3:19:25.960]  I don't play with Mr. Health
[3:19:25.960 --> 3:19:27.960]  but if I wasn't taking products

[3:20:03.960 --> 3:20:05.960]  it's Alex Jones
[3:20:09.960 --> 3:20:11.960]  back there with you
[3:20:11.960 --> 3:20:13.960]  on the Alex Jones show
[3:20:13.960 --> 3:20:15.960]  my guest Dr. Lee Merritt
[3:20:15.960 --> 3:20:17.960]  I love her to pieces
[3:20:17.960 --> 3:20:19.960]  she's so fantastic
[3:20:19.960 --> 3:20:21.960]  and we have so many things to talk about
[3:20:21.960 --> 3:20:23.960]  I also wanted to mention this too
[3:20:23.960 --> 3:20:25.960]  I interviewed Dr. Brian Artis again
[3:20:25.960 --> 3:20:27.960]  and he talked about if you have lost
[3:20:27.960 --> 3:20:29.960]  your taste and smell
[3:20:29.960 --> 3:20:31.960]  to try nicotine gum for 3 days
[3:20:31.960 --> 3:20:33.960]  half a dose, 3 times a day
[3:20:33.960 --> 3:20:35.960]  like half of a piece of gum
[3:20:35.960 --> 3:20:37.960]  3 times a day for 3 days
[3:20:37.960 --> 3:20:39.960]  and you're going to get your taste and smell back
[3:20:39.960 --> 3:20:41.960]  I wanted to share that because I know a lot of people
[3:20:41.960 --> 3:20:43.960]  are struggling with some of these things
[3:20:43.960 --> 3:20:45.960]  and it has a lot to do with the nicotine receptors
[3:20:45.960 --> 3:20:47.960]  there's just a lot of things that we're faced with
[3:20:47.960 --> 3:20:49.960]  and sometimes the answer just like smokers
[3:20:49.960 --> 3:20:51.960]  smokers just
[3:20:51.960 --> 3:20:53.960]  you didn't see them getting, you know, pneumonia
[3:20:53.960 --> 3:20:55.960]  whatever was going on
[3:20:55.960 --> 3:20:57.960]  I don't think it's COVID, COVID's a label
[3:20:57.960 --> 3:20:59.960]  but you get the drift
[3:20:59.960 --> 3:21:01.960]  a lot of people still struggle with taste and smell
[3:21:01.960 --> 3:21:03.960]  I just thought that was really fascinating
[3:21:03.960 --> 3:21:05.960]  and kind of interesting so that you could do that
[3:21:05.960 --> 3:21:07.960]  come up with a lot of good stuff
[3:21:07.960 --> 3:21:09.960]  and I honestly think if you start getting sick
[3:21:09.960 --> 3:21:11.960]  it might not be a bad idea to just try it
[3:21:11.960 --> 3:21:13.960]  it's funny that
[3:21:13.960 --> 3:21:15.960]  unlike so many other things
[3:21:15.960 --> 3:21:17.960]  it seems, and I wonder now
[3:21:17.960 --> 3:21:19.960]  about flu, I don't know
[3:21:19.960 --> 3:21:21.960]  I didn't notice, I don't treat people with this usually
[3:21:21.960 --> 3:21:23.960]  but certainly in the
[3:21:23.960 --> 3:21:25.960]  COVID whatever we want to call this
[3:21:25.960 --> 3:21:27.960]  the outbreak, the first round of this
[3:21:27.960 --> 3:21:29.960]  people that were smokers were not
[3:21:29.960 --> 3:21:31.960]  very well represented
[3:21:31.960 --> 3:21:33.960]  in fact they didn't show up very often
[3:21:33.960 --> 3:21:35.960]  it was mostly non-smokers, he's right about that
[3:21:35.960 --> 3:21:37.960]  so
[3:21:37.960 --> 3:21:39.960]  they have the big thing about
[3:21:39.960 --> 3:21:41.960]  people always ask me
[3:21:41.960 --> 3:21:43.960]  what do you think about the venom issue
[3:21:43.960 --> 3:21:45.960]  and he and I are friends, we talked about this
[3:21:45.960 --> 3:21:47.960]  and we talked about it
[3:21:47.960 --> 3:21:49.960]  because he's the one that really got me on the parasite
[3:21:49.960 --> 3:21:51.960]  program
[3:21:51.960 --> 3:21:53.960]  I mean the whole thinking about parasites
[3:21:53.960 --> 3:21:55.960]  but he
[3:21:55.960 --> 3:21:57.960]  the whole thing about the venom is
[3:21:57.960 --> 3:21:59.960]  it's just not the way it happened
[3:21:59.960 --> 3:22:01.960]  I'm not saying they don't have venom somehow
[3:22:01.960 --> 3:22:03.960]  in here in the vaccines, that could be possible
[3:22:03.960 --> 3:22:05.960]  but what's against that
[3:22:05.960 --> 3:22:07.960]  is the clinical presentation
[3:22:07.960 --> 3:22:09.960]  it did not
[3:22:09.960 --> 3:22:11.960]  the fact that they measured it in the blood
[3:22:11.960 --> 3:22:13.960]  it could be
[3:22:13.960 --> 3:22:15.960]  your body producing something like that
[3:22:15.960 --> 3:22:17.960]  it could be but it's just not
[3:22:17.960 --> 3:22:19.960]  it doesn't fit because it's
[3:22:19.960 --> 3:22:21.960]  dose related and the people that should have died
[3:22:21.960 --> 3:22:23.960]  would have been the children, the smaller body
[3:22:23.960 --> 3:22:25.960]  weight, that isn't what happened
[3:22:25.960 --> 3:22:27.960]  it was the obese people that died
[3:22:27.960 --> 3:22:29.960]  not the little people that died
[3:22:29.960 --> 3:22:31.960]  when you get bitten by a snake
[3:22:31.960 --> 3:22:33.960]  body mass helps, I mean if you're a big guy
[3:22:33.960 --> 3:22:35.960]  you're less apt to die from a certain dose
[3:22:35.960 --> 3:22:37.960]  than a little person
[3:22:37.960 --> 3:22:39.960]  but what is true, and I think this is already
[3:22:39.960 --> 3:22:41.960]  we're seeing some of this
[3:22:41.960 --> 3:22:43.960]  we're already seeing bottled waters that
[3:22:43.960 --> 3:22:45.960]  have graphene oxide in it
[3:22:45.960 --> 3:22:47.960]  so my advice is
[3:22:47.960 --> 3:22:49.960]  do not drink bottled water
[3:22:49.960 --> 3:22:51.960]  just from a practical bio weapons point
[3:22:51.960 --> 3:22:53.960]  it's not impossible
[3:22:53.960 --> 3:22:55.960]  to dose a building
[3:22:55.960 --> 3:22:57.960]  you can certainly dose a building with a toxin
[3:22:57.960 --> 3:22:59.960]  they've shown that
[3:22:59.960 --> 3:23:01.960]  but dosing a city
[3:23:01.960 --> 3:23:03.960]  gets harder, it doesn't matter that there's
[3:23:03.960 --> 3:23:05.960]  underground connections and that it's all
[3:23:05.960 --> 3:23:07.960]  interconnected, it's just volume
[3:23:07.960 --> 3:23:09.960]  related, you can't just do this in a stealth
[3:23:09.960 --> 3:23:11.960]  manner in an easy way
[3:23:11.960 --> 3:23:13.960]  unless you're using a very
[3:23:13.960 --> 3:23:15.960]  very concentrated nerve
[3:23:15.960 --> 3:23:17.960]  toxin and
[3:23:17.960 --> 3:23:19.960]  then venom doesn't quite make that
[3:23:19.960 --> 3:23:21.960]  VX maybe or something like that but not this
[3:23:21.960 --> 3:23:23.960]  but what is possible
[3:23:23.960 --> 3:23:25.960]  and easy to do for these guys
[3:23:25.960 --> 3:23:27.960]  would be to dose your bottled water
[3:23:27.960 --> 3:23:29.960]  there's very little quality control
[3:23:29.960 --> 3:23:31.960]  in bottled water, it turns out
[3:23:31.960 --> 3:23:33.960]  you think there is and people think
[3:23:33.960 --> 3:23:35.960]  I always used to think bottled water was
[3:23:35.960 --> 3:23:37.960]  more preferable when I was traveling than tap water
[3:23:37.960 --> 3:23:39.960]  turns out that's not true
[3:23:39.960 --> 3:23:41.960]  now I just drink tap water when I'm traveling
[3:23:41.960 --> 3:23:43.960]  and I use my chlorine dioxide and I neutralize
[3:23:43.960 --> 3:23:45.960]  the fluoride but
[3:23:45.960 --> 3:23:47.960]  if you have good filters you're better off with your tap water
[3:23:49.960 --> 3:23:51.960]  absolutely
[3:23:51.960 --> 3:23:53.960]  and also on that gum it was
[3:23:53.960 --> 3:23:55.960]  10 minutes, half a piece
[3:23:55.960 --> 3:23:57.960]  and it's three times a day for three days
[3:23:57.960 --> 3:23:59.960]  that's what he talked about but I'm excited to talk
[3:23:59.960 --> 3:24:01.960]  to you about cancer, about parasites
[3:24:01.960 --> 3:24:03.960]  I mean you have so much information
[3:24:03.960 --> 3:24:05.960]  I don't even know where to start Dr. Merritt
[3:24:05.960 --> 3:24:07.960]  you have so much great information
[3:24:07.960 --> 3:24:09.960]  you're one of the great researchers, people
[3:24:09.960 --> 3:24:11.960]  you don't realize this
[3:24:11.960 --> 3:24:13.960]  Dr. Merritt does her homework and then does extra
[3:24:13.960 --> 3:24:15.960]  homework for everybody else
[3:24:15.960 --> 3:24:17.960]  so I love the fact that you're hitting hard
[3:24:17.960 --> 3:24:19.960]  on our history with virus
[3:24:19.960 --> 3:24:21.960]  we need to re-examine that
[3:24:21.960 --> 3:24:23.960]  our history with cancer, we need to re-examine
[3:24:23.960 --> 3:24:25.960]  that, oh my gosh, I mean could anything be more
[3:24:25.960 --> 3:24:27.960]  pathetic that King fraud a lot is trying to do
[3:24:27.960 --> 3:24:29.960]  right now is the cancer moonshot
[3:24:29.960 --> 3:24:31.960]  so tell me some of your thoughts
[3:24:31.960 --> 3:24:33.960]  on cancer
[3:24:33.960 --> 3:24:35.960]  and virus
[3:24:35.960 --> 3:24:37.960]  well yeah
[3:24:37.960 --> 3:24:39.960]  and honestly Kate
[3:24:39.960 --> 3:24:41.960]  I appreciate you kind of got me started
[3:24:41.960 --> 3:24:43.960]  on the old archives of
[3:24:43.960 --> 3:24:45.960]  newspapers which really
[3:24:45.960 --> 3:24:47.960]  illuminates what's been going on
[3:24:47.960 --> 3:24:49.960]  not just about 1918 but it turns out also
[3:24:49.960 --> 3:24:51.960]  Woodstock
[3:24:51.960 --> 3:24:53.960]  did anybody remember, I was in college then
[3:24:53.960 --> 3:24:55.960]  does anybody remember that there was a flu pandemic
[3:24:55.960 --> 3:24:57.960]  during Woodstock?
[3:24:57.960 --> 3:24:59.960]  No, we just remember that all these people were grouped
[3:24:59.960 --> 3:25:01.960]  together at Woodstock and they
[3:25:01.960 --> 3:25:03.960]  didn't get sick, nobody remembered it
[3:25:03.960 --> 3:25:05.960]  when you ask people that went to Woodstock
[3:25:05.960 --> 3:25:07.960]  weren't you worried about the flu they say
[3:25:07.960 --> 3:25:09.960]  no, not really, what flu
[3:25:09.960 --> 3:25:11.960]  they were all young people
[3:25:11.960 --> 3:25:13.960]  so there's been a
[3:25:13.960 --> 3:25:15.960]  a very interesting Psyop
[3:25:15.960 --> 3:25:17.960]  going on about these viruses for a long time
[3:25:17.960 --> 3:25:19.960]  but the issue of parasites is really
[3:25:19.960 --> 3:25:21.960]  I'll tell you how
[3:25:21.960 --> 3:25:23.960]  I got first
[3:25:23.960 --> 3:25:25.960]  you know, God works in funny ways
[3:25:25.960 --> 3:25:27.960]  and he gives you little dips of information
[3:25:27.960 --> 3:25:29.960]  and all different things in your life and sometimes
[3:25:29.960 --> 3:25:31.960]  they just come together and that's parasites for me
[3:25:31.960 --> 3:25:33.960]  so a year
[3:25:33.960 --> 3:25:35.960]  or so ago
[3:25:35.960 --> 3:25:37.960]  one of my friends who's a pastor
[3:25:37.960 --> 3:25:39.960]  a minister had throat cancer
[3:25:39.960 --> 3:25:41.960]  and he, his wife found
[3:25:41.960 --> 3:25:43.960]  fenbendazol.org
[3:25:43.960 --> 3:25:45.960]  it's an underlying group that treats cancer
[3:25:45.960 --> 3:25:47.960]  using fenbendazol
[3:25:47.960 --> 3:25:49.960]  otherwise known as Panicure C
[3:25:49.960 --> 3:25:51.960]  is a dewormer
[3:25:51.960 --> 3:25:53.960]  they use for cattle and dogs
[3:25:53.960 --> 3:25:55.960]  if you take your dog down until you get dewormed
[3:25:55.960 --> 3:25:57.960]  with Panicure C
[3:25:57.960 --> 3:25:59.960]  we used to deworm farm families
[3:25:59.960 --> 3:26:01.960]  and they stopped kind of doing that
[3:26:01.960 --> 3:26:03.960]  but here's the problem
[3:26:03.960 --> 3:26:05.960]  the problem is we all have parasites
[3:26:05.960 --> 3:26:07.960]  the bottom line here is we all have parasites
[3:26:07.960 --> 3:26:09.960]  now why does it treat cancer
[3:26:09.960 --> 3:26:11.960]  what is cancer?
[3:26:11.960 --> 3:26:13.960]  my friend was under the impression that fenbendazol was one of these drugs
[3:26:13.960 --> 3:26:15.960]  that also treated cancer and treated parasites
[3:26:15.960 --> 3:26:17.960]  so it was good that he got it
[3:26:17.960 --> 3:26:19.960]  and he did very well, better than his cohorts
[3:26:19.960 --> 3:26:21.960]  in the treatment program
[3:26:21.960 --> 3:26:23.960]  so why, but what's the issue?
[3:26:23.960 --> 3:26:25.960]  the issue is when we see somebody
[3:26:25.960 --> 3:26:27.960]  that pops up and we say they have metastases
[3:26:27.960 --> 3:26:29.960]  we see these things on the MRI
[3:26:29.960 --> 3:26:31.960]  and there are all these different
[3:26:31.960 --> 3:26:33.960]  globule things on MRI
[3:26:33.960 --> 3:26:35.960]  but DayMR doesn't tell you what it is
[3:26:35.960 --> 3:26:37.960]  the MRI shows
[3:26:37.960 --> 3:26:39.960]  spots based on the physical properties
[3:26:39.960 --> 3:26:41.960]  of what you're looking at
[3:26:41.960 --> 3:26:43.960]  so if it's gotten more water, if the water is moving
[3:26:43.960 --> 3:26:45.960]  different things like that cause it to be bright or dark
[3:26:45.960 --> 3:26:47.960]  well when we look at MRIs
[3:26:47.960 --> 3:26:49.960]  and we see all these spots
[3:26:49.960 --> 3:26:51.960]  we just say oh, they've got metastases
[3:26:51.960 --> 3:26:53.960]  and then we start looking for a primary cancer somewhere
[3:26:53.960 --> 3:26:55.960]  same thing with MS
[3:26:55.960 --> 3:26:57.960]  MS, we always thought
[3:26:57.960 --> 3:26:59.960]  MS is this neurologic diagnosis
[3:26:59.960 --> 3:27:01.960]  we don't completely know what causes it
[3:27:01.960 --> 3:27:03.960]  but we can diagnose it on MRI
[3:27:03.960 --> 3:27:05.960]  because we see these bright spots in your brain and your spinal cord
[3:27:05.960 --> 3:27:07.960]  well it turns out
[3:27:07.960 --> 3:27:09.960]  a pathologist down in Florida
[3:27:09.960 --> 3:27:11.960]  did a study of
[3:27:11.960 --> 3:27:13.960]  autopsies of
[3:27:13.960 --> 3:27:15.960]  MS deaths
[3:27:15.960 --> 3:27:17.960]  and 100% of them had
[3:27:17.960 --> 3:27:19.960]  parasites in the brain and spinal cord
[3:27:19.960 --> 3:27:21.960]  so what we're seeing and calling plaques
[3:27:21.960 --> 3:27:23.960]  turn out to be parasite damage
[3:27:23.960 --> 3:27:25.960]  same thing I think
[3:27:25.960 --> 3:27:27.960]  is going on with the parasites
[3:27:27.960 --> 3:27:29.960]  and one of the things
[3:27:29.960 --> 3:27:31.960]  I've noticed in this is that
[3:27:31.960 --> 3:27:33.960]  when I was in the military, young guys
[3:27:33.960 --> 3:27:35.960]  the 20 year olds that were your classic military
[3:27:35.960 --> 3:27:37.960]  personnel
[3:27:37.960 --> 3:27:39.960]  when they showed up and they had a cancer
[3:27:39.960 --> 3:27:41.960]  it was just a single cancer
[3:27:41.960 --> 3:27:43.960]  maybe a testicular cancer, that's an age related thing
[3:27:43.960 --> 3:27:45.960]  that they have
[3:27:45.960 --> 3:27:47.960]  okay, now if they take
[3:27:47.960 --> 3:27:49.960]  this vaccine, they show up
[3:27:49.960 --> 3:27:51.960]  with cancer all over their body
[3:27:51.960 --> 3:27:53.960]  now what is that, why would this be going on
[3:27:53.960 --> 3:27:55.960]  well it's because these guys are
[3:27:55.960 --> 3:27:57.960]  exposed to parasites probably more than the average
[3:27:57.960 --> 3:27:59.960]  because they're all over the world doing this
[3:27:59.960 --> 3:28:01.960]  and then we don't
[3:28:01.960 --> 3:28:03.960]  know completely what's in the vaccine because they still haven't told us
[3:28:03.960 --> 3:28:05.960]  for these thousands of pages of
[3:28:05.960 --> 3:28:07.960]  redacted junk they send us
[3:28:07.960 --> 3:28:09.960]  but what we do know is some of the effects
[3:28:09.960 --> 3:28:11.960]  and one of the effects is
[3:28:11.960 --> 3:28:13.960]  it drops out your tall like receptors
[3:28:13.960 --> 3:28:15.960]  it's part of your immune system
[3:28:15.960 --> 3:28:17.960]  that is like the Roman centuries
[3:28:17.960 --> 3:28:19.960]  doing vigilance on your parasites
[3:28:19.960 --> 3:28:21.960]  so we're now, when you take the vaccine
[3:28:21.960 --> 3:28:23.960]  you drop off the centuries
[3:28:23.960 --> 3:28:25.960]  that alerts your immune system that there are parasites
[3:28:25.960 --> 3:28:27.960]  that need to be walled off out there
[3:28:27.960 --> 3:28:29.960]  that's what I think is going on
[3:28:29.960 --> 3:28:31.960]  much more to say but that's how I got into
[3:28:31.960 --> 3:28:33.960]  thinking about parasites
[3:28:33.960 --> 3:28:35.960]  and how to get a protocol together to
[3:28:35.960 --> 3:28:37.960]  not let people die from this
[3:28:37.960 --> 3:28:39.960]  absolutely, you know women are being told
[3:28:39.960 --> 3:28:41.960]  don't go in for a breast exam
[3:28:41.960 --> 3:28:43.960]  if you take the shot for six months because
[3:28:43.960 --> 3:28:45.960]  they will find cancer
[3:28:45.960 --> 3:28:47.960]  and they're in total denial and say it's not
[3:28:47.960 --> 3:28:49.960]  really cancer but it'll just looks
[3:28:49.960 --> 3:28:51.960]  like cancer, oh good grief, we'll be right
[3:28:51.960 --> 3:28:53.960]  back with Dr. Lee Merritt on the Alex Jones show
[3:28:53.960 --> 3:28:55.960]  so stay with us, you're not going to want to
[3:28:55.960 --> 3:28:57.960]  once a tragedy reaches
[3:28:57.960 --> 3:28:59.960]  a level of national significance
[3:28:59.960 --> 3:29:01.960]  American citizens
[3:29:01.960 --> 3:29:03.960]  should be allowed to basically
[3:29:03.960 --> 3:29:05.960]  question that event
[3:29:05.960 --> 3:29:07.960]  in any way that they deem fit
[3:29:07.960 --> 3:29:09.960]  the first amendment is unique in the world
[3:29:09.960 --> 3:29:11.960]  that's what they want to take away
[3:29:11.960 --> 3:29:13.960]  your ability to speak freely
[3:29:13.960 --> 3:29:15.960]  so they're going to go for Mike Lindell next
[3:29:15.960 --> 3:29:17.960]  or they're going to go for Steve Bannon
[3:29:17.960 --> 3:29:19.960]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson
[3:29:19.960 --> 3:29:21.960]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago but on there 28 years
[3:29:21.960 --> 3:29:23.960]  and I knew they were planning all of this
[3:29:23.960 --> 3:29:25.960]  and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere
[3:29:25.960 --> 3:29:27.960]  but I couldn't have done it without your support
[3:29:27.960 --> 3:29:29.960]  and now because we've been so successful
[3:29:29.960 --> 3:29:31.960]  warning the population of the planet

[3:29:33.960 --> 3:29:35.960]  that's why it's more important

[3:33:10.960 --> 3:33:13.960]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show my guest
[3:33:13.960 --> 3:33:15.960]  Dr. Lee Merritt happy to be with you today
[3:33:15.960 --> 3:33:17.960]  make sure you go get those supplements
[3:33:17.960 --> 3:33:19.960]  in bulk make sure you have them
[3:33:19.960 --> 3:33:21.960]  they'll keep on the shelf I promise
[3:33:21.960 --> 3:33:23.960]  but get your supplements in order
[3:33:23.960 --> 3:33:25.960]  I'm serious I always get your house in order
[3:33:25.960 --> 3:33:27.960]  get your supplements in order because
[3:33:27.960 --> 3:33:29.960]  the way that our medical cartel is going
[3:33:29.960 --> 3:33:31.960]  I think that we'll have a lot of supplements
[3:33:31.960 --> 3:33:33.960]  slip away from the market
[3:33:33.960 --> 3:33:35.960]  and get them while you can because we really need to
[3:33:35.960 --> 3:33:37.960]  make sure we have quite a bit handy
[3:33:37.960 --> 3:33:39.960]  our immune system is getting attacked
[3:33:39.960 --> 3:33:41.960]  and for the last 100 years
[3:33:41.960 --> 3:33:43.960]  they've been doing a huge huge number
[3:33:43.960 --> 3:33:45.960]  on our immune system and we haven't realized it
[3:33:45.960 --> 3:33:47.960]  I think
[3:33:47.960 --> 3:33:49.960]  we flock to go get a vaccine so stupidly
[3:33:49.960 --> 3:33:51.960]  because we think that's going to save us
[3:33:51.960 --> 3:33:53.960]  when really and truly I think it's
[3:33:53.960 --> 3:33:55.960]  what's been doing the damage to us all along
[3:33:55.960 --> 3:33:57.960]  especially if you go do some homework
[3:33:57.960 --> 3:33:59.960]  the AMA so just so corrupt
[3:33:59.960 --> 3:34:01.960]  I was just listening to a speaker say
[3:34:01.960 --> 3:34:03.960]  you know the medical cartel is 10 times more corrupt
[3:34:03.960 --> 3:34:05.960]  than even government
[3:34:05.960 --> 3:34:07.960]  I mean can you get more corrupt than Washington
[3:34:07.960 --> 3:34:09.960]  DC
[3:34:09.960 --> 3:34:11.960]  Dr. Merritt I mean there are many things
[3:34:11.960 --> 3:34:13.960]  I mean mind blowing on the MS by the way
[3:34:13.960 --> 3:34:15.960]  wow
[3:34:15.960 --> 3:34:17.960]  there are many things like that though in our past
[3:34:17.960 --> 3:34:19.960]  that they chalked up to virus that they chalked up
[3:34:19.960 --> 3:34:21.960]  to this infectious illness
[3:34:21.960 --> 3:34:23.960]  and everybody knows if you just take a step back
[3:34:23.960 --> 3:34:25.960]  when your family members are sick
[3:34:25.960 --> 3:34:27.960]  you didn't automatically get sick did you
[3:34:27.960 --> 3:34:29.960]  so no one ever
[3:34:29.960 --> 3:34:31.960]  we don't even look at the evidence
[3:34:31.960 --> 3:34:33.960]  right in front of our faces that
[3:34:33.960 --> 3:34:35.960]  these things really could not
[3:34:35.960 --> 3:34:37.960]  be infectious it's just it's your
[3:34:37.960 --> 3:34:39.960]  it's the immune system kind of
[3:34:39.960 --> 3:34:41.960]  manifesting itself in the same symptoms
[3:34:41.960 --> 3:34:43.960]  over and over again saying
[3:34:43.960 --> 3:34:45.960]  you're not doing well with your immune system
[3:34:45.960 --> 3:34:47.960]  but what are your thoughts I mean there's so many things
[3:34:47.960 --> 3:34:49.960]  like MS
[3:34:49.960 --> 3:34:51.960]  right so when we talk about
[3:34:51.960 --> 3:34:53.960]  viruses well so MS is a
[3:34:53.960 --> 3:34:55.960]  perfect example and I think cancer is also
[3:34:55.960 --> 3:34:57.960]  an example of in medicine
[3:34:57.960 --> 3:34:59.960]  we have this acronym WNL
[3:34:59.960 --> 3:35:01.960]  and it's supposed to mean within normal
[3:35:01.960 --> 3:35:03.960]  limits but in point of fact it often
[3:35:03.960 --> 3:35:05.960]  means we never looked so the reason
[3:35:05.960 --> 3:35:07.960]  we didn't figure that out in MS is nobody
[3:35:07.960 --> 3:35:09.960]  bothered to autopsy these people
[3:35:09.960 --> 3:35:11.960]  and look at it critically they all are
[3:35:11.960 --> 3:35:13.960]  looking at things with this paradigm
[3:35:13.960 --> 3:35:15.960]  that this disease is one of those
[3:35:15.960 --> 3:35:17.960]  things we don't know about so look over here
[3:35:17.960 --> 3:35:19.960]  we'll just do it this way this is
[3:35:19.960 --> 3:35:21.960]  a virus so we look over in this box
[3:35:21.960 --> 3:35:23.960]  we're not looking at it with an open
[3:35:23.960 --> 3:35:25.960]  scientific mind now as you
[3:35:25.960 --> 3:35:27.960]  and I've talked about and you've helped research too
[3:35:27.960 --> 3:35:29.960]  is in 1918 they actually
[3:35:29.960 --> 3:35:31.960]  looked at they did autopsies
[3:35:31.960 --> 3:35:33.960]  of the victims and they
[3:35:33.960 --> 3:35:35.960]  actually tried to prove transmission
[3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:37.960]  they couldn't prove transmission and they
[3:35:37.960 --> 3:35:39.960]  couldn't prove what was causing the problem
[3:35:39.960 --> 3:35:41.960]  those autopsies were then
[3:35:41.960 --> 3:35:43.960]  looked at by a Chinese group in
[3:35:43.960 --> 3:35:45.960]  2018 I think
[3:35:45.960 --> 3:35:47.960]  and they were and they looked at
[3:35:47.960 --> 3:35:49.960]  the old pathologic blocks of
[3:35:49.960 --> 3:35:51.960]  the influenza deaths and
[3:35:51.960 --> 3:35:53.960]  they concluded using modern
[3:35:53.960 --> 3:35:55.960]  quote genetic and
[3:35:55.960 --> 3:35:57.960]  virologic techniques
[3:35:57.960 --> 3:35:59.960]  that they still didn't know what cost
[3:35:59.960 --> 3:36:01.960]  the pandemic of 1918
[3:36:01.960 --> 3:36:03.960]  and so what happened here
[3:36:03.960 --> 3:36:05.960]  we when the
[3:36:05.960 --> 3:36:07.960]  COVID when this thing broke out
[3:36:07.960 --> 3:36:09.960]  and by the way don't you think it's kind of
[3:36:09.960 --> 3:36:11.960]  interesting that they I remember them
[3:36:11.960 --> 3:36:13.960]  sitting around kind of showing how
[3:36:13.960 --> 3:36:15.960]  they were debating what to call this and it was
[3:36:15.960 --> 3:36:17.960]  they came up with COVID-19 what
[3:36:17.960 --> 3:36:19.960]  when Richard Rothschild in
[3:36:19.960 --> 3:36:21.960]  2015 patented a
[3:36:21.960 --> 3:36:23.960]  test for COVID-19
[3:36:23.960 --> 3:36:25.960]  and it was shipped out in
[3:36:25.960 --> 3:36:27.960]  2018 I mean you know and I looked
[3:36:27.960 --> 3:36:29.960]  into that that's not rumor that's
[3:36:29.960 --> 3:36:31.960]  being multiple patent
[3:36:31.960 --> 3:36:33.960]  libraries so
[3:36:33.960 --> 3:36:35.960]  in any case so this is all a scam
[3:36:35.960 --> 3:36:37.960]  but whatever it is these
[3:36:37.960 --> 3:36:39.960]  guys they
[3:36:39.960 --> 3:36:41.960]  the transmission
[3:36:41.960 --> 3:36:43.960]  they look the Chinese looked
[3:36:43.960 --> 3:36:45.960]  at again at the blocks and they said we still
[3:36:45.960 --> 3:36:47.960]  can't figure it out and our people
[3:36:47.960 --> 3:36:49.960]  when they when they finally got tired
[3:36:49.960 --> 3:36:51.960]  of being told don't do autopsies we were
[3:36:51.960 --> 3:36:53.960]  told don't do autopsies and there was
[3:36:53.960 --> 3:36:55.960]  no systematic for all the
[3:36:55.960 --> 3:36:57.960]  billions that we give to the CDC
[3:36:57.960 --> 3:36:59.960]  and the FDA and NIH all great
[3:36:59.960 --> 3:37:01.960]  researchers all great universities they
[3:37:01.960 --> 3:37:03.960]  didn't systematically do a
[3:37:03.960 --> 3:37:05.960]  pathologic clinical
[3:37:05.960 --> 3:37:07.960]  review of
[3:37:07.960 --> 3:37:09.960]  all the cases they diagnosed as COVID
[3:37:09.960 --> 3:37:11.960]  nobody wanted to know
[3:37:11.960 --> 3:37:13.960]  no they didn't want to know we never
[3:37:13.960 --> 3:37:15.960]  looked we just don't want to know they didn't want us to
[3:37:15.960 --> 3:37:17.960]  know but but now
[3:37:17.960 --> 3:37:19.960]  about mid-June of 2021
[3:37:19.960 --> 3:37:21.960]  a paper was published by pathologists that they
[3:37:21.960 --> 3:37:23.960]  looked at all these it was I think
[3:37:23.960 --> 3:37:25.960]  26 papers and
[3:37:25.960 --> 3:37:27.960]  360 patients roughly something like
[3:37:27.960 --> 3:37:29.960]  that and they looked at
[3:37:29.960 --> 3:37:31.960]  what they and they
[3:37:31.960 --> 3:37:33.960]  screened there's a meta-analysis of autopsy
[3:37:33.960 --> 3:37:35.960]  and
[3:37:35.960 --> 3:37:37.960]  in COVID positive patients and
[3:37:37.960 --> 3:37:39.960]  guess what they said also this is a year
[3:37:39.960 --> 3:37:41.960]  and a half after the outbreak started
[3:37:41.960 --> 3:37:43.960]  and they said we still don't know
[3:37:43.960 --> 3:37:45.960]  in the vast majority of these cases
[3:37:45.960 --> 3:37:47.960]  what killed them what
[3:37:47.960 --> 3:37:49.960]  what this disease is they would just so know
[3:37:49.960 --> 3:37:51.960]  they don't have an etiology so
[3:37:51.960 --> 3:37:53.960]  when we talk about a lot of stuff
[3:37:53.960 --> 3:37:55.960]  we're talking about it at a
[3:37:55.960 --> 3:37:57.960]  basic unknown level
[3:37:57.960 --> 3:37:59.960]  we don't know what we should know by now
[3:37:59.960 --> 3:38:01.960]  so something when you can't
[3:38:01.960 --> 3:38:03.960]  figure it out with all these smart people
[3:38:03.960 --> 3:38:05.960]  there's something wrong around the world and I'm saying
[3:38:05.960 --> 3:38:07.960]  what it is it's like the magician
[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:09.960]  that wiggles his right hand and the answers
[3:38:09.960 --> 3:38:11.960]  in front of you but we're not paying attention to it
[3:38:11.960 --> 3:38:13.960]  we need to look at what's in front of you
[3:38:13.960 --> 3:38:15.960]  and this whole thing with parasites I gotta say
[3:38:15.960 --> 3:38:17.960]  first of all
[3:38:17.960 --> 3:38:19.960]  it fits
[3:38:19.960 --> 3:38:21.960]  what we're seeing if you really look at it
[3:38:21.960 --> 3:38:23.960]  besides the military people
[3:38:23.960 --> 3:38:25.960]  I talked about look at all the people that you know
[3:38:25.960 --> 3:38:27.960]  that had cancer that was in remission
[3:38:27.960 --> 3:38:29.960]  and then suddenly they took
[3:38:29.960 --> 3:38:31.960]  the vaccine so-called vaccine and their cancer
[3:38:31.960 --> 3:38:33.960]  just blew out all over the place
[3:38:33.960 --> 3:38:35.960]  you know
[3:38:35.960 --> 3:38:37.960]  it's about your immune system
[3:38:37.960 --> 3:38:39.960]  and using what they've done is
[3:38:39.960 --> 3:38:41.960]  the part of this is
[3:38:41.960 --> 3:38:43.960]  they've actually
[3:38:43.960 --> 3:38:45.960]  dumbed down our immune system
[3:38:45.960 --> 3:38:47.960]  to make us vulnerable to our own
[3:38:47.960 --> 3:38:49.960]  parasites but it gets even worse
[3:38:49.960 --> 3:38:51.960]  now when you look at what Karen Kingston
[3:38:51.960 --> 3:38:53.960]  just came up with she found
[3:38:53.960 --> 3:38:55.960]  old stuff from Ralph Berrick
[3:38:55.960 --> 3:38:57.960]  that Ralph Berrick admitted
[3:38:57.960 --> 3:38:59.960]  well you know yes we did isolate this spike
[3:38:59.960 --> 3:39:01.960]  protein genetically and we tried to manipulate
[3:39:01.960 --> 3:39:03.960]  and do this stuff but it just didn't work very well
[3:39:03.960 --> 3:39:05.960]  you know
[3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:07.960]  so that's one fact the other fact is
[3:39:07.960 --> 3:39:09.960]  the RNA idea this idea
[3:39:09.960 --> 3:39:11.960]  that we have RNA that this is all about RNA
[3:39:11.960 --> 3:39:13.960]  whether it's in the virus
[3:39:13.960 --> 3:39:15.960]  or in the vaccine
[3:39:15.960 --> 3:39:17.960]  you know
[3:39:17.960 --> 3:39:19.960]  there's nothing wrong with that I realized
[3:39:19.960 --> 3:39:21.960]  when I said
[3:39:21.960 --> 3:39:23.960]  the RNA
[3:39:23.960 --> 3:39:25.960]  therapies that we actually did get to market
[3:39:25.960 --> 3:39:27.960]  then there was only a couple but
[3:39:27.960 --> 3:39:29.960]  the one that was the most promising was one about
[3:39:29.960 --> 3:39:31.960]  eyes
[3:39:31.960 --> 3:39:33.960]  and it cost a million dollars a dose
[3:39:33.960 --> 3:39:35.960]  in 2018 are you telling me that in two years time frame
[3:39:35.960 --> 3:39:37.960]  we now can have an mRNA
[3:39:37.960 --> 3:39:39.960]  vaccine for 30 billion people and then
[3:39:39.960 --> 3:39:41.960]  we created it the time course
[3:39:41.960 --> 3:39:43.960]  to make 30 billion or not 30 billion
[3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:45.960]  but however many doses they put out
[3:39:45.960 --> 3:39:47.960]  a lot of billions of doses
[3:39:47.960 --> 3:39:49.960]  because they've vaccinated people sometimes
[3:39:49.960 --> 3:39:51.960]  four and five times all over the world
[3:39:51.960 --> 3:39:53.960]  they say 70% of us are all vaccinated
[3:39:53.960 --> 3:39:55.960]  you couldn't have produced that in the short
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:39:57.960]  of time just to not forget
[3:39:57.960 --> 3:39:59.960]  the research and development how could you produce
[3:39:59.960 --> 3:40:01.960]  that many vials there's something wrong
[3:40:01.960 --> 3:40:03.960]  with that too and something wrong with the money so
[3:40:03.960 --> 3:40:05.960]  if you get away from the idea this
[3:40:05.960 --> 3:40:07.960]  is mRNA mediated
[3:40:07.960 --> 3:40:09.960]  look at what Karen Kingston just came up with
[3:40:09.960 --> 3:40:11.960]  she said you know there's hydrogel
[3:40:11.960 --> 3:40:13.960]  the three things that the 18 labs found
[3:40:13.960 --> 3:40:15.960]  in these vaccines of all sorts
[3:40:15.960 --> 3:40:17.960]  hydrogel, graphene oxide
[3:40:17.960 --> 3:40:19.960]  and metals
[3:40:19.960 --> 3:40:21.960]  hydrogel is not just
[3:40:21.960 --> 3:40:23.960]  a thing that
[3:40:23.960 --> 3:40:25.960]  you know it's a polymer that's cross-length
[3:40:25.960 --> 3:40:27.960]  that absorbs water that's at its simplest level
[3:40:27.960 --> 3:40:29.960]  we use hydrogel in labs
[3:40:29.960 --> 3:40:31.960]  we use hydrogel to make contact
[3:40:31.960 --> 3:40:33.960]  and lenses there's lots of stuff
[3:40:33.960 --> 3:40:35.960]  but now we have genetically
[3:40:35.960 --> 3:40:37.960]  engineered hydrogel that
[3:40:37.960 --> 3:40:39.960]  they're literally saying is a new life form
[3:40:39.960 --> 3:40:41.960]  it can multiply it can
[3:40:41.960 --> 3:40:43.960]  expand
[3:40:43.960 --> 3:40:45.960]  and it can react to outside forces
[3:40:45.960 --> 3:40:47.960]  including wavelengths so you've got
[3:40:47.960 --> 3:40:49.960]  they call it smart hydrogel
[3:40:49.960 --> 3:40:51.960]  and now you've got smart genetic engineered hydrogel
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:53.960]  and that is what
[3:40:53.960 --> 3:40:55.960]  apparently she has found data
[3:40:55.960 --> 3:40:57.960]  that has made the spike protein
[3:40:57.960 --> 3:40:59.960]  the thing you're showing on that picture now that they've got you
[3:40:59.960 --> 3:41:01.960]  everybody's scared about ooh that spike protein
[3:41:01.960 --> 3:41:03.960]  most of this in fact all of this
[3:41:03.960 --> 3:41:05.960]  is CGI the picture that
[3:41:05.960 --> 3:41:07.960]  we classically see of the blue
[3:41:07.960 --> 3:41:09.960]  it looks like a blue ball with all these
[3:41:09.960 --> 3:41:11.960]  spiky things coming out of it it looks really
[3:41:11.960 --> 3:41:13.960]  scary it sounds scary that's
[3:41:13.960 --> 3:41:15.960]  CGI it's nothing it's a picture it's no
[3:41:15.960 --> 3:41:17.960]  more real than my dryer balls that look very
[3:41:17.960 --> 3:41:19.960]  similar you know
[3:41:19.960 --> 3:41:21.960]  so but what these are
[3:41:21.960 --> 3:41:23.960]  is this hydrogel like you're seeing
[3:41:23.960 --> 3:41:25.960]  right there it can conform
[3:41:25.960 --> 3:41:27.960]  to 5G so in one
[3:41:27.960 --> 3:41:29.960]  confirmation it can hook into your H2
[3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:31.960]  pathway in another confirmation
[3:41:31.960 --> 3:41:33.960]  it doesn't so they can dose us with this hydrogel
[3:41:33.960 --> 3:41:35.960]  it can get into
[3:41:35.960 --> 3:41:37.960]  us it acts like a synthetic
[3:41:37.960 --> 3:41:39.960]  parasite and then they can
[3:41:39.960 --> 3:41:41.960]  turn on the 5G and create disease outbreaks
[3:41:41.960 --> 3:41:43.960]  wherever they want I think that's what's
[3:41:43.960 --> 3:41:45.960]  happening now
[3:41:45.960 --> 3:41:47.960]  when it comes to parasite why the other thing
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:49.960]  is I'll have to say remember George Carlin
[3:41:49.960 --> 3:41:51.960]  the seven words you couldn't say on TV well now
[3:41:51.960 --> 3:41:53.960]  you can say all of those words on TV
[3:41:53.960 --> 3:41:55.960]  here are the six words you can't say on TV
[3:41:55.960 --> 3:41:57.960]  right now you can't say
[3:41:57.960 --> 3:41:59.960]  nitrous oxide chloroquine hydroxychloroquine
[3:41:59.960 --> 3:42:01.960]  ivermectin fembendazole and chlorine
[3:42:01.960 --> 3:42:03.960]  dioxide
[3:42:03.960 --> 3:42:05.960]  those are the six antiparasitic drugs
[3:42:05.960 --> 3:42:07.960]  and they all seem to work some better
[3:42:07.960 --> 3:42:09.960]  than others so honestly
[3:42:09.960 --> 3:42:11.960]  that's why we all need
[3:42:11.960 --> 3:42:13.960]  to start treating ourselves
[3:42:13.960 --> 3:42:15.960]  I've got a new video coming out that'll be up
[3:42:15.960 --> 3:42:17.960]  tonight I hope all about
[3:42:17.960 --> 3:42:19.960]  so if anybody has questions because I get 10 or 15
[3:42:19.960 --> 3:42:21.960]  calls a day to go over
[3:42:21.960 --> 3:42:23.960]  the parasite protocol no I can't do it for everybody
[3:42:23.960 --> 3:42:25.960]  it's gonna be on this video
[3:42:25.960 --> 3:42:27.960]  love that go to
[3:42:27.960 --> 3:42:29.960]  themedicalrebel.com

[3:42:31.960 --> 3:42:33.960]  things for your health and the newest

[3:42:37.960 --> 3:42:39.960]  the newest latest and we'll come back
[3:42:39.960 --> 3:42:41.960]  we have more trust me on this
[3:42:41.960 --> 3:42:43.960]  there's so much more to discuss
[3:42:43.960 --> 3:42:45.960]  make sure you're getting supplements
[3:42:45.960 --> 3:42:47.960]  I think there's such a war on supplements
[3:42:47.960 --> 3:42:49.960]  and they would love to get rid of supplements
[3:42:49.960 --> 3:42:51.960]  I think that's obviously it's been
[3:42:51.960 --> 3:42:53.960]  their attack for a while it's still coming
[3:42:53.960 --> 3:42:55.960]  be right back
[3:42:55.960 --> 3:42:57.960]  don't let the globalist
[3:42:57.960 --> 3:42:59.960]  monsters and their mercenary
[3:42:59.960 --> 3:43:01.960]  minions be successful at silencing
[3:43:01.960 --> 3:43:03.960]  you and the globalist
[3:43:03.960 --> 3:43:05.960]  number one mission is to silence info wars
[3:43:05.960 --> 3:43:07.960]  because they rightly see us
[3:43:07.960 --> 3:43:09.960]  as one of the main beacons of resistance
[3:43:09.960 --> 3:43:11.960]  alerting the people not as of America
[3:43:11.960 --> 3:43:13.960]  but the world to the threat
[3:43:13.960 --> 3:43:15.960]  of the globalist and their censorship
[3:43:15.960 --> 3:43:17.960]  and tyranny that's why it's so

[3:44:07.960 --> 3:44:09.960]  we've broken together
[3:44:09.960 --> 3:44:11.960]  this family that is info wars
[3:44:11.960 --> 3:44:13.960]  think about how info wars
[3:44:13.960 --> 3:44:15.960]  is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson
[3:44:15.960 --> 3:44:17.960]  and Ball Sonaro and other foreign
[3:44:17.960 --> 3:44:19.960]  leaders like Nigel Farage
[3:44:19.960 --> 3:44:21.960]  as being the main
[3:44:21.960 --> 3:44:23.960]  impetus towards
[3:44:23.960 --> 3:44:25.960]  firing up their main base
[3:44:25.960 --> 3:44:27.960]  to defeat the new world order
[3:44:27.960 --> 3:44:29.960]  the only reason
[3:44:29.960 --> 3:44:31.960]  humanity is still in the fight today
[3:44:31.960 --> 3:44:33.960]  is because the viewers

[3:46:03.960 --> 3:46:05.960]  we were able to do this so I salute you and I thank you
[3:46:05.960 --> 3:46:07.960]  now you know about fluoride
[3:46:07.960 --> 3:46:09.960]  the bad halogen on the periodic table
[3:46:09.960 --> 3:46:11.960]  well high quality iodine
[3:46:11.960 --> 3:46:13.960]  is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride
[3:46:13.960 --> 3:46:15.960]  and when you've got it in your body
[3:46:15.960 --> 3:46:17.960]  it doesn't just supercharge your cells

[3:46:19.960 --> 3:46:21.960]  but it also blocks the bad halogens
[3:46:21.960 --> 3:46:23.960]  in the fluoride chlorine
[3:46:23.960 --> 3:46:25.960]  bromide bromine family

[3:47:11.960 --> 3:47:13.960]  back to you on the alex jones show final segment
[3:47:13.960 --> 3:47:15.960]  with dr. ween merritt
[3:47:15.960 --> 3:47:17.960]  your guest host my website
[3:47:17.960 --> 3:47:19.960]  kaitdallyradio.com
[3:47:19.960 --> 3:47:21.960]  and of course dr. lee merritt's website
[3:47:21.960 --> 3:47:23.960]  themedicalrebel.com
[3:47:23.960 --> 3:47:25.960]  you really need to look at her website too
[3:47:25.960 --> 3:47:27.960]  because let me just tell you there's great info
[3:47:27.960 --> 3:47:29.960]  on there and you know I've
[3:47:29.960 --> 3:47:31.960]  referred to america as fiza america
[3:47:31.960 --> 3:47:33.960]  because we have turned
[3:47:33.960 --> 3:47:35.960]  into a pharma nation and pharma
[3:47:35.960 --> 3:47:37.960]  is who backs all the politicians
[3:47:37.960 --> 3:47:39.960]  and buys them off and we have
[3:47:39.960 --> 3:47:41.960]  so many problems because of pharma
[3:47:41.960 --> 3:47:43.960]  I know that people credit pharma
[3:47:43.960 --> 3:47:45.960]  then there are instances where pharma
[3:47:45.960 --> 3:47:47.960]  is credited but I actually think
[3:47:47.960 --> 3:47:49.960]  had we gone with more natural processes
[3:47:49.960 --> 3:47:51.960]  as it was totally ousted by pharma
[3:47:51.960 --> 3:47:53.960]  back in the early 1900s we would have been so much
[3:47:53.960 --> 3:47:55.960]  better off because we would have had all the side
[3:47:55.960 --> 3:47:57.960]  effects and additional drugs you have to take
[3:47:57.960 --> 3:47:59.960]  with pharma but you know people
[3:47:59.960 --> 3:48:01.960]  die every winter and
[3:48:01.960 --> 3:48:03.960]  talk talk to me about
[3:48:03.960 --> 3:48:05.960]  what are they dying from because a lot of people
[3:48:05.960 --> 3:48:07.960]  go yeah well I got I got the flu
[3:48:07.960 --> 3:48:09.960]  from you know so and so and so
[3:48:09.960 --> 3:48:11.960]  talk to me about winter
[3:48:11.960 --> 3:48:13.960]  because we're just about to launch in time
[3:48:13.960 --> 3:48:15.960]  yeah because flu means influenza
[3:48:15.960 --> 3:48:17.960]  I mean flu influenza
[3:48:17.960 --> 3:48:19.960]  means influence it doesn't mean
[3:48:19.960 --> 3:48:21.960]  a disease it doesn't think it doesn't even
[3:48:21.960 --> 3:48:23.960]  and and we have hundreds of years
[3:48:23.960 --> 3:48:25.960]  of data that show that
[3:48:25.960 --> 3:48:27.960]  this disease would spontaneously
[3:48:27.960 --> 3:48:29.960]  erupt around the world
[3:48:29.960 --> 3:48:31.960]  simultaneously in the age
[3:48:31.960 --> 3:48:33.960]  of wooden ships and iron men you couldn't
[3:48:33.960 --> 3:48:35.960]  sail that fast around the world and ships
[3:48:35.960 --> 3:48:37.960]  would be out alone on the
[3:48:37.960 --> 3:48:39.960]  on the in the middle of the ocean
[3:48:39.960 --> 3:48:41.960]  like in the Napoleonic Wars in the middle
[3:48:41.960 --> 3:48:43.960]  of the ocean and they would get an influenza
[3:48:43.960 --> 3:48:45.960]  outbreak now that in the
[3:48:45.960 --> 3:48:47.960]  no contact with land but the landowners having
[3:48:47.960 --> 3:48:49.960]  it too can't explain that
[3:48:49.960 --> 3:48:51.960]  on a on an airborne little
[3:48:51.960 --> 3:48:53.960]  thing that comes out of our mouths okay so what's
[3:48:53.960 --> 3:48:55.960]  going on well some some really smart
[3:48:55.960 --> 3:48:57.960]  astronomers figured out it
[3:48:57.960 --> 3:48:59.960]  correlated perfectly with sunspot
[3:48:59.960 --> 3:49:01.960]  cycles because and sun activity flares
[3:49:01.960 --> 3:49:03.960]  and cycles ionization
[3:49:03.960 --> 3:49:05.960]  we're electrical beings when you ionize
[3:49:05.960 --> 3:49:07.960]  the atmosphere problems
[3:49:07.960 --> 3:49:09.960]  problems happen and this is the problem
[3:49:09.960 --> 3:49:11.960]  of 5g now this has been the problem
[3:49:11.960 --> 3:49:13.960]  from the time of the 1918
[3:49:13.960 --> 3:49:15.960]  pandemic and the telegram
[3:49:15.960 --> 3:49:17.960]  lines and you know people had
[3:49:17.960 --> 3:49:19.960]  telegraphers disease from living around
[3:49:19.960 --> 3:49:21.960]  or working underneath the telegram lines
[3:49:21.960 --> 3:49:23.960]  and the way that the telegram
[3:49:23.960 --> 3:49:25.960]  company actually solved it is interesting
[3:49:25.960 --> 3:49:27.960]  they put a long twist
[3:49:27.960 --> 3:49:29.960]  in the wire so it gave off a different
[3:49:29.960 --> 3:49:31.960]  electromagnetic signal and didn't make them
[3:49:31.960 --> 3:49:33.960]  sick and that's why now we have
[3:49:33.960 --> 3:49:35.960]  an opportunity to do something similar but
[3:49:35.960 --> 3:49:37.960]  so what happens in the winter
[3:49:37.960 --> 3:49:39.960]  with flu when we call it the flu season
[3:49:39.960 --> 3:49:41.960]  and I call it winter death season now
[3:49:41.960 --> 3:49:43.960]  because we can't say it's due to influenza
[3:49:43.960 --> 3:49:45.960]  generally
[3:49:45.960 --> 3:49:47.960]  it's the most infirm people
[3:49:47.960 --> 3:49:49.960]  you don't notice the winter death season
[3:49:49.960 --> 3:49:51.960]  taking your usual unlike this vaccine
[3:49:51.960 --> 3:49:53.960]  nightmare we don't usually see sudden death
[3:49:53.960 --> 3:49:55.960]  of young healthy people
[3:49:55.960 --> 3:49:57.960]  okay we see the elderly being taken out
[3:49:57.960 --> 3:49:59.960]  the the immune compromise
[3:49:59.960 --> 3:50:01.960]  the infirm now
[3:50:01.960 --> 3:50:03.960]  here's what's how and actually
[3:50:03.960 --> 3:50:05.960]  credit Larry Pilewski clued me into this
[3:50:05.960 --> 3:50:07.960]  and then I read some work by a doctor
[3:50:07.960 --> 3:50:09.960]  and a PhD in
[3:50:09.960 --> 3:50:11.960]  University of Washington on
[3:50:11.960 --> 3:50:13.960]  the you can look it up yourself
[3:50:13.960 --> 3:50:15.960]  it's called the exclusionary zone of water
[3:50:15.960 --> 3:50:17.960]  okay so we all have
[3:50:17.960 --> 3:50:19.960]  toxins in the body and how
[3:50:19.960 --> 3:50:21.960]  do we get rid of them there are only certain ways we can
[3:50:21.960 --> 3:50:23.960]  get rid of them but it ultimately it's in
[3:50:23.960 --> 3:50:25.960]  ourselves and we have to excrete them out of ourselves
[3:50:25.960 --> 3:50:27.960]  and out of us either you
[3:50:27.960 --> 3:50:29.960]  you poop it out you you
[3:50:29.960 --> 3:50:31.960]  you vomit it out you
[3:50:31.960 --> 3:50:33.960]  sweat it out and
[3:50:33.960 --> 3:50:35.960]  and it comes out of
[3:50:35.960 --> 3:50:37.960]  but it comes out of yourselves now we've always been taught
[3:50:37.960 --> 3:50:39.960]  that our energy comes only from
[3:50:39.960 --> 3:50:41.960]  food that we're not plants we don't get
[3:50:41.960 --> 3:50:43.960]  energy from the sun but that's not true
[3:50:43.960 --> 3:50:45.960]  every cell in our body is like a battery
[3:50:45.960 --> 3:50:47.960]  it's got a dipole
[3:50:47.960 --> 3:50:49.960]  it's it's it's got a more
[3:50:49.960 --> 3:50:51.960]  positive end a more negative end it's
[3:50:51.960 --> 3:50:53.960]  it's charged okay and
[3:50:53.960 --> 3:50:55.960]  to charge your battery we actually get
[3:50:55.960 --> 3:50:57.960]  benefit from the infrared and near-infrared
[3:50:57.960 --> 3:50:59.960]  rays of the sun that's what
[3:50:59.960 --> 3:51:01.960]  those wavelengths do for us
[3:51:01.960 --> 3:51:03.960]  so in the summer we don't see a death
[3:51:03.960 --> 3:51:05.960]  cycle because people are outside
[3:51:05.960 --> 3:51:07.960]  more they get more sunlight
[3:51:07.960 --> 3:51:09.960]  they have they stock up their batteries they
[3:51:09.960 --> 3:51:11.960]  can get rid of toxins and now they can
[3:51:11.960 --> 3:51:13.960]  work long hours and no problem
[3:51:13.960 --> 3:51:15.960]  but what happens in the winter well
[3:51:15.960 --> 3:51:17.960]  now we don't have as much sun we're
[3:51:17.960 --> 3:51:19.960]  wearing a lot of clothes in the cold
[3:51:19.960 --> 3:51:21.960]  climate areas and we tend
[3:51:21.960 --> 3:51:23.960]  to have
[3:51:23.960 --> 3:51:25.960]  a you know we
[3:51:25.960 --> 3:51:27.960]  we go to bed later we
[3:51:27.960 --> 3:51:29.960]  still stay up late because we have electric lights
[3:51:29.960 --> 3:51:31.960]  right so we're not acting like our great
[3:51:31.960 --> 3:51:33.960]  my great grandparents they didn't have
[3:51:33.960 --> 3:51:35.960]  electricity so they would have gone to bed when the sun goes down
[3:51:35.960 --> 3:51:37.960]  but we don't we stay up late
[3:51:37.960 --> 3:51:39.960]  we get ready for Christmas the kids are coming
[3:51:39.960 --> 3:51:41.960]  home we clean the house we do all these things
[3:51:41.960 --> 3:51:43.960]  but we don't have the energy input
[3:51:43.960 --> 3:51:45.960]  from the sun to really really keep
[3:51:45.960 --> 3:51:47.960]  ourselves our batteries charged you know we always
[3:51:47.960 --> 3:51:49.960]  said you know he's so and so he did that to
[3:51:49.960 --> 3:51:51.960]  keep being charged up his batteries meaning he got some
[3:51:51.960 --> 3:51:53.960]  sleep or some rest and he got some food
[3:51:53.960 --> 3:51:55.960]  they that really is true you know we
[3:51:55.960 --> 3:51:57.960]  have batteries in us so
[3:51:57.960 --> 3:51:59.960]  when you don't charge them up with the sun
[3:51:59.960 --> 3:52:01.960]  then you don't
[3:52:01.960 --> 3:52:03.960]  have that dipole and you can't get rid of
[3:52:03.960 --> 3:52:05.960]  toxins and so the toxins get built up
[3:52:05.960 --> 3:52:07.960]  and the most vulnerable die
[3:52:07.960 --> 3:52:09.960]  from toxicity it's essentially toxicity
[3:52:09.960 --> 3:52:11.960]  you don't need a virus to
[3:52:11.960 --> 3:52:13.960]  explain this whole thing and there's
[3:52:13.960 --> 3:52:15.960]  guy in Washington actually shows how it
[3:52:15.960 --> 3:52:17.960]  works how the how you put a negative charge
[3:52:17.960 --> 3:52:19.960]  how you use the dipole in
[3:52:19.960 --> 3:52:21.960]  yourselves to wall off a toxin now here's the other thing
[3:52:21.960 --> 3:52:23.960]  as you were saying everything
[3:52:23.960 --> 3:52:25.960]  they do they've done since 1905
[3:52:25.960 --> 3:52:27.960]  has been to damage us
[3:52:27.960 --> 3:52:29.960]  what is one of the things that they've done
[3:52:29.960 --> 3:52:31.960]  they've made it so that every time
[3:52:31.960 --> 3:52:33.960]  you have a fever or your kid has a fever
[3:52:33.960 --> 3:52:35.960]  oh we got to get that fever down
[3:52:35.960 --> 3:52:37.960]  no let's suppose
[3:52:37.960 --> 3:52:39.960]  think of your your cells water is not
[3:52:39.960 --> 3:52:41.960]  in a water form it's like gelatin it's
[3:52:41.960 --> 3:52:43.960]  a gel water it's the fourth state
[3:52:43.960 --> 3:52:45.960]  of water they call it and so
[3:52:45.960 --> 3:52:47.960]  think about if I put
[3:52:47.960 --> 3:52:49.960]  some you could experiment yourself
[3:52:49.960 --> 3:52:51.960]  if you had pepper and you put ground
[3:52:51.960 --> 3:52:53.960]  pepper and you mixed it in the gelatin
[3:52:53.960 --> 3:52:55.960]  when it froze and now you want to get those pieces out
[3:52:55.960 --> 3:52:57.960]  how would you do it well you'd melt the gelatin
[3:52:57.960 --> 3:52:59.960]  right you make it softer then the pepper
[3:52:59.960 --> 3:53:01.960]  will rise up or sink or something
[3:53:01.960 --> 3:53:03.960]  it'll come out of the out of the gelatin
[3:53:03.960 --> 3:53:05.960]  your cells when you get sick
[3:53:05.960 --> 3:53:07.960]  you have a temperature
[3:53:07.960 --> 3:53:09.960]  animals will move up a gradient to get
[3:53:09.960 --> 3:53:11.960]  warmer because when they get sick they have to get rid
[3:53:11.960 --> 3:53:13.960]  of this toxin their cells get warmer
[3:53:13.960 --> 3:53:15.960]  the gelatin gets softer they can
[3:53:15.960 --> 3:53:17.960]  expel the toxins what if our medical
[3:53:17.960 --> 3:53:19.960]  people continuing to tell us
[3:53:19.960 --> 3:53:21.960]  oh take this
[3:53:21.960 --> 3:53:23.960]  ibuprofen take this for the
[3:53:23.960 --> 3:53:25.960]  flu take this for temperature bring down
[3:53:25.960 --> 3:53:27.960]  the temperature no the
[3:53:27.960 --> 3:53:29.960]  only thing and don't ever take a chemical
[3:53:29.960 --> 3:53:31.960]  to bring down the temperature that's a double
[3:53:31.960 --> 3:53:33.960]  whammy to kill you what you do
[3:53:33.960 --> 3:53:35.960]  is if you have a temperature you live with
[3:53:35.960 --> 3:53:37.960]  it and if it gets too uncomfortable
[3:53:37.960 --> 3:53:39.960]  if it gets up over a hundred and four
[3:53:39.960 --> 3:53:41.960]  or something then then okay
[3:53:41.960 --> 3:53:43.960]  sponge yourself down
[3:53:43.960 --> 3:53:45.960]  or you know sponge your child down
[3:53:45.960 --> 3:53:47.960]  in a bathtub like grandma used to do
[3:53:47.960 --> 3:53:49.960]  like my mother used to do
[3:53:49.960 --> 3:53:51.960]  they never gave me ibuprofen
[3:53:51.960 --> 3:53:53.960]  for a fever that's not the right thing to do
[3:53:53.960 --> 3:53:55.960]  but our medical people continue to
[3:53:55.960 --> 3:53:57.960]  do it
[3:53:57.960 --> 3:53:59.960]  that's what kills us the winter
[3:53:59.960 --> 3:54:01.960]  don't need viruses it's toxins
[3:54:01.960 --> 3:54:03.960]  I love this
[3:54:03.960 --> 3:54:05.960]  I love it when you just explained it like this
[3:54:05.960 --> 3:54:07.960]  because these are the things we've been missing
[3:54:07.960 --> 3:54:09.960]  we have not been educated on any of this
[3:54:09.960 --> 3:54:11.960]  I think the whole vaccine program
[3:54:11.960 --> 3:54:13.960]  really and truly was to hurt our immune system
[3:54:13.960 --> 3:54:15.960]  we didn't need it we have good sanitation
[3:54:15.960 --> 3:54:17.960]  we don't need it when you have good sanitation
[3:54:17.960 --> 3:54:19.960]  at a time and they sold it
[3:54:19.960 --> 3:54:21.960]  to us at a time of great sanitation here in America
[3:54:21.960 --> 3:54:23.960]  so there's just so many things
[3:54:23.960 --> 3:54:25.960]  like this and I think
[3:54:25.960 --> 3:54:27.960]  that's such great advice we run
[3:54:27.960 --> 3:54:29.960]  to go get anything chemical
[3:54:29.960 --> 3:54:31.960]  or pharma in our bodies when truly
[3:54:31.960 --> 3:54:33.960]  what we should be looking at is past
[3:54:33.960 --> 3:54:35.960]  remedies really there's
[3:54:35.960 --> 3:54:37.960]  brilliant knowledge in these things
[3:54:37.960 --> 3:54:39.960]  any doctor could have done what I did
[3:54:39.960 --> 3:54:41.960]  like this is not my specialty I'm an orthopedic surgeon
[3:54:41.960 --> 3:54:43.960]  okay but I started
[3:54:43.960 --> 3:54:45.960]  looking into the vaccine I
[3:54:45.960 --> 3:54:47.960]  unfortunately I vaccinated my children I wouldn't do it
[3:54:47.960 --> 3:54:49.960]  again but I vaccinated them because
[3:54:49.960 --> 3:54:51.960]  I was a classically trained physician right
[3:54:51.960 --> 3:54:53.960]  but I can remember
[3:54:53.960 --> 3:54:55.960]  I should have remembered this because I remembered it later
[3:54:55.960 --> 3:54:57.960]  my professor of medicine
[3:54:57.960 --> 3:54:59.960]  pediatrics in medical school said
[3:54:59.960 --> 3:55:01.960]  vaccines didn't care childhood diseases
[3:55:01.960 --> 3:55:03.960]  plumbers did and his point was
[3:55:03.960 --> 3:55:05.960]  just what you said it was sanitation
[3:55:05.960 --> 3:55:07.960]  and nutrition that increased
[3:55:07.960 --> 3:55:09.960]  that decreased death from
[3:55:09.960 --> 3:55:11.960]  childhood diseases now one thing everybody
[3:55:11.960 --> 3:55:13.960]  asked me about is well how do I get
[3:55:13.960 --> 3:55:15.960]  how do your kids get chicken pox now
[3:55:15.960 --> 3:55:17.960]  well I mean there's a couple of possibilities
[3:55:17.960 --> 3:55:19.960]  but what I think it is what I think
[3:55:19.960 --> 3:55:21.960]  it's going to turn out to be is the
[3:55:21.960 --> 3:55:23.960]  electromagnetic transmission
[3:55:23.960 --> 3:55:25.960]  of disease you see that is the scariest
[3:55:25.960 --> 3:55:27.960]  thing is that we now know through
[3:55:27.960 --> 3:55:29.960]  Luke Montagnier and Jacques Benveniste
[3:55:29.960 --> 3:55:31.960]  that water has memory and that
[3:55:31.960 --> 3:55:33.960]  you can capture the electromagnetic
[3:55:33.960 --> 3:55:35.960]  signal and
[3:55:35.960 --> 3:55:37.960]  and of biomolecules
[3:55:37.960 --> 3:55:39.960]  and transmit them
[3:55:39.960 --> 3:55:41.960]  Dr. Kosnachev a Russian in the 20s
[3:55:41.960 --> 3:55:43.960]  and 30s showed you can
[3:55:43.960 --> 3:55:45.960]  transmit disease
[3:55:45.960 --> 3:55:47.960]  by
[3:55:47.960 --> 3:55:49.960]  ultraviolet and near ultraviolet
[3:55:49.960 --> 3:55:51.960]  photons from one dying
[3:55:51.960 --> 3:55:53.960]  cells that have been poisoned
[3:55:53.960 --> 3:55:55.960]  to unpoisoned cells that will then
[3:55:55.960 --> 3:55:57.960]  start to die the same way
[3:55:57.960 --> 3:55:59.960]  he figured out he showed this in thousands
[3:55:59.960 --> 3:56:01.960]  of experiments
[3:56:01.960 --> 3:56:03.960]  and so if
[3:56:03.960 --> 3:56:05.960]  it's possible these psychopaths
[3:56:05.960 --> 3:56:07.960]  could capture the death photons
[3:56:07.960 --> 3:56:09.960]  some disease and broadcast it
[3:56:09.960 --> 3:56:11.960]  with 5G on all of us
[3:56:11.960 --> 3:56:13.960]  that's how chicken pox could possibly
[3:56:13.960 --> 3:56:15.960]  happen you know my body
[3:56:15.960 --> 3:56:17.960]  and I'm a three and a half year old I
[3:56:17.960 --> 3:56:19.960]  it's time to detox I start detoxing
[3:56:19.960 --> 3:56:21.960]  I get these little scabby things and little
[3:56:21.960 --> 3:56:23.960]  things on my rash and then
[3:56:23.960 --> 3:56:25.960]  but those my
[3:56:25.960 --> 3:56:27.960]  cells are giving off an electromagnetic
[3:56:27.960 --> 3:56:29.960]  photon
[3:56:29.960 --> 3:56:31.960]  consistent with chicken pox
[3:56:31.960 --> 3:56:33.960]  that my four year old friend
[3:56:33.960 --> 3:56:35.960]  in the room takes up and then
[3:56:35.960 --> 3:56:37.960]  gets his body says oh time to detox
[3:56:37.960 --> 3:56:39.960]  okay I'll do it too
[3:56:39.960 --> 3:56:41.960]  that sounds
[3:56:41.960 --> 3:56:43.960]  right so if bodies
[3:56:43.960 --> 3:56:45.960]  talk to each other that's why women's
[3:56:45.960 --> 3:56:47.960]  cycles sync up when they live together bodies
[3:56:47.960 --> 3:56:49.960]  talk to each other and what you're saying is we
[3:56:49.960 --> 3:56:51.960]  have so much proof of it
[3:56:51.960 --> 3:56:53.960]  right nobody knows that but they don't
[3:56:53.960 --> 3:56:55.960]  explain it and how do ourselves
[3:56:55.960 --> 3:56:57.960]  talk to each other
[3:56:57.960 --> 3:56:59.960]  right exactly and Tesla
[3:56:59.960 --> 3:57:01.960]  was right he said you want to understand the
[3:57:01.960 --> 3:57:03.960]  universe
[3:57:03.960 --> 3:57:05.960]  this medium that you're talking about
[3:57:05.960 --> 3:57:07.960]  is really what kind of rules the earth
[3:57:07.960 --> 3:57:09.960]  and he figured it out and of course they
[3:57:09.960 --> 3:57:11.960]  took him out
[3:57:11.960 --> 3:57:13.960]  and dismissed all of his findings
[3:57:13.960 --> 3:57:15.960]  or stole them who knows but
[3:57:15.960 --> 3:57:17.960]  now Dr. Lee Merritt
[3:57:17.960 --> 3:57:19.960]  I was going to say Tesla also said
[3:57:19.960 --> 3:57:21.960]  though everything in biologic
[3:57:21.960 --> 3:57:23.960]  life is between six and eight hertz
[3:57:23.960 --> 3:57:25.960]  and if we understand how it all works
[3:57:25.960 --> 3:57:27.960]  then we can use wavelength
[3:57:27.960 --> 3:57:29.960]  to control the mind
