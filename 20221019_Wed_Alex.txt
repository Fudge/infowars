[00:00:16.384 --> 00:00:17.524]  InfoWars.
[00:00:17.524 --> 00:00:18.705]  Tomorrow's news.
[00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:19.085]  Today.
[00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:25.264]  This is Uncle Sam with music and the truth until dawn.
[00:00:25.264 --> 00:00:29.328]  Right now, I've got a few words for some of our brothers and sisters in the occupied zone.
[00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.550]  The chair is against the wall.
[00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.252]  John has a long mustache.
[00:00:33.252 --> 00:00:36.635]  This is the heart of 1776!
[00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:37.936]  It's 12 o'clock, Americans.
[00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:39.298]  Another day closer to victory.
[00:00:39.298 --> 00:00:43.622]  And for all of you out there on or behind the lines, this is your song.
[00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:53.913]  Good job.
[00:01:07.355 --> 00:01:12.698]  Well, BlackRock and Larry in particular are a great example of private sector leadership.
[00:01:12.698 --> 00:01:28.726]  You know, anyone who says that climate shouldn't be a factor in how you evaluate the future of a company, you know, that's not capitalism because companies that have emissions, you know, they are going to be subject to border adjustment tariffs or
[00:01:29.907 --> 00:01:31.307]  Taxes.
[00:01:31.307 --> 00:01:32.888]  You also have to think about companies.
[00:01:32.888 --> 00:01:38.689]  You know, if you're dealing with severe weather events, that's got to be factored in.
[00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.330]  Is the company ensuring that?
[00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.810]  Are they becoming more resilient?
[00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.752]  So the attacks are kind of illogical because climate does affect the economy, which does affect
[00:01:49.412 --> 00:01:50.633]  Investments.
[00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:56.376]  The idea that we still need oil and natural gas is also fairly clear.
[00:01:56.376 --> 00:01:59.038]  We're not going to drain all the money away from those sectors.
[00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:00.699]  That's how people get to work today.
[00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:04.741]  It's how people avoid freezing to death in the winter.
[00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:10.905]  And people did get a little optimistic about how quickly the transition could be done.
[00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:17.228]  Now, without the Russian natural gas being available in Europe, it's a setback.
[00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:23.313]  You know, we need to find non-Russian hydrocarbon sources to substitute for those.
[00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:36.403]  So there's coal plants running and a variety of things because, you know, keeping, you know, people warm, keeping those economies in decent shape is a priority.
[00:02:36.403 --> 00:02:43.948]  Now, on the other hand, it's good for the long run because people won't want to be dependent on Russian natural gas.
[00:02:43.948 --> 00:02:47.291]  So they'll move to these new approaches more rapidly.
[00:02:47.788 --> 00:02:49.670]  And you talk about companies protecting themselves.
[00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.575]  What do you think about the Fed stress testing banks for climate?
[00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:58.117]  That's the SCGs.
[00:02:58.117 --> 00:03:02.000]  It's Wednesday, October 19th, 2022.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:11.988]  And the most important issue ever to take place in the human history of our planet is hiding in plain view.
[00:03:11.988 --> 00:03:13.809]  And I'm very angry at myself.
[00:03:14.881 --> 00:03:19.766]  Because what I talk about, what the great danger is, I did yesterday.
[00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:27.394]  Because I already knew this, and I was already very close to this, and we've already talked about it ad nauseum, but it's admitted now, publicly.
[00:03:27.394 --> 00:03:33.800]  It was admitted in the documents and the reports and the rest of it, but here it is.
[00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.301]  And what am I talking about?
[00:03:36.127 --> 00:03:38.289]  End-of-the-world type stuff.
[00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:39.550]  Gain-of-function.
[00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:42.032]  Peter Daszak, Fauci, Bill Gates.
[00:03:42.032 --> 00:03:55.322]  They are like the 12-monkey cult in that great 1990s film of Bruce Willis, where these elite cult biomedical scientists release a virus that kills everybody that comes in contact with it.
[00:03:55.322 --> 00:04:04.850]  They have developed not dozens, not hundreds, but thousands of different strains and different varieties of viruses that kill
[00:04:08.022 --> 00:04:11.005]  99% of people that come in contact.
[00:04:11.005 --> 00:04:17.391]  And I've gone and pulled some of the older articles, but yesterday it broke, and I mentioned it as a footnote.
[00:04:17.391 --> 00:04:21.675]  And thank God it became a bigger story yesterday and everybody else is covering it, and that's good news.
[00:04:21.675 --> 00:04:28.161]  But it just proves Fauci lied to Congress and all the rest of it, that in Boston, at Boston University,
[00:04:29.192 --> 00:04:41.581]  They developed with human mice clones, they're mice that have human DNA, so it's exactly the same as humans, 80% kill rate with a COVID.
[00:04:41.581 --> 00:04:45.204]  I told you they had stuff way worse than what they released, that was just the beta test.
[00:04:45.204 --> 00:04:50.748]  I'm gonna tell you what's going on, I'm telling you, they could imminently release this and wipe everybody out.
[00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:54.891]  COVID was the beta test to see if we would stand down and stay in our houses and die when they do it.
[00:04:54.891 --> 00:04:56.272]  They're preparing to kill everyone.
[00:04:56.272 --> 00:04:56.853]  Stay with us.
[00:05:00.799 --> 00:05:02.641]  It's our best seller.
[00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:06.406]  We first came out with it five years ago, and it was a moderate seller.
[00:05:06.406 --> 00:05:15.498]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall best seller.
[00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:17.540]  And it's been sold out for a while, but it's finally back in stock.
[00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:24.726]  Vitamin-mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[00:05:24.726 --> 00:05:31.852]  It has all the minerals, all the key amino acids, all of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[00:05:31.852 --> 00:05:34.474]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[00:05:34.474 --> 00:05:42.300]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:49.467]  Now there are other great Vitamin Mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWar.
[00:05:49.467 --> 00:05:57.236]  So the only way you lose is not taking action today, getting Vitamin Mineral Fusion finally back in stock at InfoWarStore.com for 50% off.
[00:05:57.236 --> 00:05:59.919]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, back in stock, InfoWarStore.com.
[00:06:04.605 --> 00:06:07.008]  Ladies and gentlemen, mark your calendars.
[00:06:07.008 --> 00:06:09.391]  Wednesday, October 19th, 2022.
[00:06:09.391 --> 00:06:17.141]  Remember in 2015, Obama was running a legal gain of function.
[00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:21.006]  Do you want to have a look at this?
[00:06:49.554 --> 00:06:50.794]  Excuse me, sir.
[00:06:50.794 --> 00:06:53.455]  Would you mind letting me have a look at the contents of your bag, please?
[00:06:53.455 --> 00:07:03.138]  Me?
[00:07:03.138 --> 00:07:05.999]  Biological samples.
[00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:08.260]  I have the papers right here.
[00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.841]  Well, I'm gonna have to ask you to open this up, sir.
[00:07:12.841 --> 00:07:15.442]  Open it?
[00:07:15.442 --> 00:07:16.002]  Yes, of course.
[00:07:17.526 --> 00:07:19.548]  What could be better?
[00:07:19.548 --> 00:07:21.510]  Come on, look over here.
[00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:22.711]  Look at the planes.
[00:07:22.711 --> 00:07:23.351]  Hurry up!
[00:07:23.351 --> 00:07:26.174]  You have to get in the lounge.
[00:07:26.174 --> 00:07:27.255]  See?
[00:07:27.255 --> 00:07:27.935]  Biological.
[00:07:27.935 --> 00:07:29.917]  Check the papers.
[00:07:29.917 --> 00:07:31.618]  It's all proper.
[00:07:31.618 --> 00:07:38.645]  Permit.
[00:07:38.645 --> 00:07:39.726]  It's empty.
[00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:41.327]  Well, yes, to be sure.
[00:07:41.327 --> 00:07:42.148]  It looks empty.
[00:07:44.932 --> 00:07:53.317]  I assure you it's not.
[00:07:53.317 --> 00:07:54.958]  There you see?
[00:07:54.958 --> 00:08:00.121]  Also invisible to the naked eye.
[00:08:00.121 --> 00:08:05.044]  It doesn't even have an odor.
[00:08:05.044 --> 00:08:07.206]  That's not necessary, sir.
[00:08:07.206 --> 00:08:08.226]  There you go.
[00:08:08.226 --> 00:08:09.867]  Thank you for your cooperation.
[00:08:09.867 --> 00:08:10.488]  Have a good flight.
[00:08:20.976 --> 00:08:23.760]  I am calling you a f****** moron!
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.541]  Hold it!
[00:08:24.541 --> 00:08:25.582]  Wait a moment.
[00:08:53.478 --> 00:08:56.483]  Please stop them!
[00:08:56.483 --> 00:08:57.164]  Police off.
[00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:35.998]  Silence InfoWars before they can stop the real biological attack that's coming.
[00:09:35.998 --> 00:09:37.719]  And they will kill you and your family.
[00:09:37.719 --> 00:09:40.301]  Most of you will be dead soon if we don't stop them.
[00:09:40.301 --> 00:09:44.804]  You're gonna be in your houses, everything's locked down, the power's off, and you're dying remembering I told you this.
[00:09:44.804 --> 00:09:45.484]  We don't stop them.
[00:09:45.484 --> 00:09:46.605]  But that's okay.
[00:09:46.605 --> 00:09:49.627]  At that point, just get right with God and realize it was a satanic attack.
[00:09:49.627 --> 00:09:51.008]  What matters is your soul.
[00:09:51.008 --> 00:09:55.211]  You and your children will be vomiting up blood and bleeding out of every orifice in your body.
[00:09:55.211 --> 00:09:58.533]  But at least you'll be politically correct and trending.
[00:09:58.533 --> 00:09:59.874]  Maybe you can spin some of your
[00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:05.881]  Money from all your anti-free speech lawsuits.
[00:10:05.881 --> 00:10:07.262]  All right.
[00:10:07.262 --> 00:10:11.064]  What I've just said I 100% know.
[00:10:11.064 --> 00:10:12.465]  I don't believe it.
[00:10:12.465 --> 00:10:14.486]  I know it.
[00:10:14.486 --> 00:10:16.047]  So let me explain something.
[00:10:16.047 --> 00:10:20.729]  I've talked about this until my jaw literally aches.
[00:10:20.729 --> 00:10:25.092]  And I've hammered it and I've shown you literally thousands of examples over the years.
[00:10:25.092 --> 00:10:26.453]  And I pulled up some examples today.
[00:10:27.202 --> 00:10:51.041]  But every major government, whether it's the British, or the Australians, or the Russians, or the Chinese, or the US, or the South Africans, or the list goes on and on, along with major corporations, have been creating for at least 30 years, since they had the ability to create synthetic DNA.
[00:10:51.041 --> 00:10:51.762]  Viruses
[00:10:53.476 --> 00:10:56.237]  That kill whatever amount they want.
[00:10:56.237 --> 00:11:01.039]  They can have it kill 1% like COVID, or they can have it kill 90 plus percent.
[00:11:01.039 --> 00:11:08.902]  Some people are so immune, have such good health, and such good vitamins and minerals, that it happened with the rats too, and the mice, that it doesn't kill them.
[00:11:08.902 --> 00:11:12.364]  In fact, they don't even get infected.
[00:11:12.364 --> 00:11:19.227]  Just like there's poisons they spray on cockroaches, and just a certain percentage are immune, and then they have babies, and they're totally immune within three generations.
[00:11:19.227 --> 00:11:21.168]  So we're tough.
[00:11:21.168 --> 00:11:21.748]  We're damn tough.
[00:11:23.131 --> 00:11:25.413]  In fact, they call us the mammalian cockroach.
[00:11:25.413 --> 00:11:30.618]  That's what the globalists call their own species, if they are human.
[00:11:30.618 --> 00:11:31.398]  So we're tough.
[00:11:31.398 --> 00:11:34.541]  Our livers are tough, our blood cells are tough, our white blood cells are tough.
[00:11:34.541 --> 00:11:35.642]  We're tough as snails.
[00:11:35.642 --> 00:11:36.603]  Tough.
[00:11:36.603 --> 00:11:40.286]  Especially when we know we're under attack and gear up to deal with it.
[00:11:40.286 --> 00:11:49.515]  But I've got all this huge news today, but the news that broke yesterday, and it's now all over and confirmed, and they're hiding it in plain view and saying, what's the big deal?
[00:11:50.839 --> 00:12:07.684]  As the usual suspects, Fauci and Bill Gates funding it along with Peter Daszak at the Boston University Medical Science Center in the last five years created a COVID.
[00:12:07.684 --> 00:12:08.364]  Oh, isn't it funny?
[00:12:08.364 --> 00:12:08.864]  It's COVID.
[00:12:11.906 --> 00:12:14.628]  That kills 80% of the humanized mice.
[00:12:14.628 --> 00:12:17.791]  And these mice are animal-human chimeras.
[00:12:17.791 --> 00:12:21.314]  They're part human, so it has the same effect on mice as it does on humans.
[00:12:21.314 --> 00:12:24.776]  It's about exactly the same.
[00:12:24.776 --> 00:12:29.460]  Gain of function, Boston University creates COVID strain with 80% mortality rate.
[00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:34.244]  And they're like, yeah, big deal!
[00:12:34.244 --> 00:12:39.248]  We've got a virus that kills 80% of the people that get it.
[00:12:42.895 --> 00:12:45.036]  But it's for biomedical research.
[00:12:45.036 --> 00:12:48.557]  And they get in front of Congress and say, no, no, no, we've never taken a virus and made it more deadly.
[00:12:48.557 --> 00:12:51.338]  The definition of gain of function.
[00:12:51.338 --> 00:13:09.185]  When there's been major scandals in the last 30 years, all over the world, particularly the U.S., where good scientists, like in the case of 2015, said they are creating a gain of function SARS chimeric virus at Chapel Hill,
[00:13:10.836 --> 00:13:15.139]  That depending on the variant could kill 80% of people.
[00:13:15.139 --> 00:13:17.700]  That's what I told you, because I've got all the angles here.
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:25.825]  They didn't release one of their really strong ones, and it was a new virus, a Chimera, not a cold, not a flu, totally new.
[00:13:25.825 --> 00:13:37.772]  They released it, killed a bunch of people, blocked the therapeutics to protect you, and then rolled out a vaccine, it's not a vaccine, that creates the autoimmune destroying, blood clot creating, heart attack triggering, stroke inducing,
[00:13:40.293 --> 00:13:42.634]  Spike protein.
[00:13:42.634 --> 00:14:06.586]  And so, at the University of Texas, Galveston, and at Boston University Medical Center, and at 46 other labs in the United States, in CONUS, continental United States, that they admit they have developed not just super COVID, but super mousepox that infects humans, and wait for it, has a 99% kill rate,
[00:14:09.494 --> 00:14:12.375]  Inhumanized mice.
[00:14:12.375 --> 00:14:15.276]  And apples to apples, it does the same thing to humans.
[00:14:15.276 --> 00:14:17.437]  Let me explain that again.
[00:14:17.437 --> 00:14:29.081]  They got viruses that literally eat your skin off and kill 99% of people, and they're all a bunch of leftist, transhumanist, anti... God scum.
[00:14:29.081 --> 00:14:32.383]  They're not just gonna stop trying to sterilize your son or cut your daughter's breast off.
[00:14:32.383 --> 00:14:34.643]  They're not gonna just stop shipping in fentanyl.
[00:14:34.643 --> 00:14:37.545]  They are a death cult that wants to kill you.
[00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:42.332]  Dr. Eric Bianca, the head of the biology department at UT.
[00:14:42.332 --> 00:14:44.134]  He's in my film, Endgame.
[00:14:44.134 --> 00:14:45.094]  He was the head then.
[00:14:45.094 --> 00:14:48.698]  He came out, gave a speech, and said, I can't wait until the airborne Ebola is released.
[00:14:48.698 --> 00:14:52.021]  It kills 90% of humanity.
[00:14:52.021 --> 00:14:58.006]  He got a standing five, six minute ovation, the news reported.
[00:14:58.006 --> 00:15:03.912]  That's your scientist, at UT, in a ballroom with 2,000 people, and the reporters were there.
[00:15:06.618 --> 00:15:07.278]  And he clarified.
[00:15:07.278 --> 00:15:09.940]  He said, yeah, I do think all of humanity should be basically wiped out.
[00:15:09.940 --> 00:15:12.781]  His students came out and said, he's a great man.
[00:15:12.781 --> 00:15:14.942]  We should kill all humans, not just 90%.
[00:15:14.942 --> 00:15:16.503]  And then I looked up the student that said that.
[00:15:16.503 --> 00:15:24.787]  It said, former student, she was working in San Diego at a bioweapons lab.
[00:15:24.787 --> 00:15:28.409]  She says, Pianka's too liberal, meaning too lenient.
[00:15:28.409 --> 00:15:29.930]  We want to kill everybody.
[00:15:30.782 --> 00:15:33.984]  She said, can you not deny humanity's a parasite?
[00:15:33.984 --> 00:15:44.111]  So we're sitting here while these monsters have created things far more dangerous than nuclear reactors, while they lecture us all day about, oh, Kanye said this, or Alex Jones said that.
[00:15:44.111 --> 00:15:48.093]  While they have created this, and we sit there, and we let them do it.
[00:15:48.093 --> 00:15:49.434]  And here's what's scary.
[00:15:49.434 --> 00:15:51.796]  When we come back, I'm gonna explain the rest of the story.
[00:15:51.796 --> 00:15:54.798]  They are preparing to release it.
[00:15:54.798 --> 00:15:57.219]  So, we either stop them, or we die.
[00:15:57.219 --> 00:15:57.960]  We'll be right back.
[00:16:00.305 --> 00:16:05.875]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[00:16:07.048 --> 00:16:20.855]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world, to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.

[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.043]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:20:06.043 --> 00:20:07.304]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:32.401 --> 00:20:37.429]  The Greatest Patriots Living joining us coming up next segment.
[00:20:37.429 --> 00:20:43.098]  We have the filmmakers of The Real Anthony Fauci with Robert Kennedy Jr.
[00:20:43.098 --> 00:20:45.442]  coming up in the third hour today.
[00:20:46.767 --> 00:21:06.802]  Okay, so you've all seen, I would guess, it's been everywhere, the last seven hearings with Senator Paul, Dr. Paul, saying you did gain a function, you let a conference call gain a function, you let a conference promoting gain a function, you funded gain a function, and Fauci lies and says we've never done gain a function.
[00:21:06.802 --> 00:21:12.487]  And then we learn, and they don't deny it, they go, of course we made something that kills 80% of humans, what's the big deal?
[00:21:16.095 --> 00:21:19.377]  It's in case somebody else produces it, we'll have the cure.
[00:21:19.377 --> 00:21:28.162]  But they're the ones that cooked it up, released it, the earlier, weaker version, as a beta test, and then gave us a poison shot that didn't protect us.
[00:21:28.162 --> 00:21:34.146]  And they're the ones that run depopulation foundations worldwide with the UN.
[00:21:34.146 --> 00:21:35.987]  Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate you.
[00:21:35.987 --> 00:21:37.448]  Bill Gates says he wants to kill you.
[00:21:37.448 --> 00:21:39.169]  Bill Gates says he wants to cut your power off.
[00:21:39.169 --> 00:21:41.410]  Bill Gates says he wants a new world order.
[00:21:41.410 --> 00:21:42.291]  Klaus Schwab says it.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:49.926]  And then, they produce the weapons illegally to do it, and laugh at us, and you know what?
[00:21:49.926 --> 00:22:01.656]  If we let them do this, I mean, think of somebody that works for the FBI, or the Justice Department, or the media, or academia, or the intelligentsia, and the clergy.
[00:22:01.656 --> 00:22:06.681]  Where are they?
[00:22:06.681 --> 00:22:08.022]  If I was a selfish person,
[00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:18.858]  I would be in a cabin with my family in the middle of nowhere, raising crops, staying away from folks, around neighbors that knew what was going on.
[00:22:18.858 --> 00:22:23.462]  I would be out right now, or years ago, looking for those places.
[00:22:23.462 --> 00:22:28.207]  Because as sure as the sun came up this morning, and as sure as it'll set this evening,
[00:22:29.383 --> 00:22:38.249]  The New World Order did their beta test and said, after we're done releasing the first virus, we'll then start cutting power off and having climate shutdowns.
[00:22:38.249 --> 00:22:48.576]  Whether people like it or not, there won't be enough energy and that will train them to stay put when the cyber attack comes and the power's turned off and then another viral attack.
[00:22:48.576 --> 00:22:53.079]  They think you're so dumb, they scripted it all publicly.
[00:22:55.376 --> 00:23:00.398]  Now obviously I put a big fat target on my back exposing this, but you know what?
[00:23:00.398 --> 00:23:03.219]  I'm not going to be part of this.
[00:23:03.219 --> 00:23:05.480]  And so I'm going to tell everybody.
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.221]  And deep down in your guts you know this, even if you're a sociopath.
[00:23:10.939 --> 00:23:31.907]  If you don't speak out against this, if you don't rally and protest, if you don't go to every city council and county commission and school board and use that pulpit to talk about this, if you don't call C-SPAN, if you don't rally at Congress, if you don't do whatever you've got to legally and lawfully to expose these mass murderers, they already drilled and set up emergency camps around the world for the next more powerful virus.
[00:23:32.807 --> 00:23:35.349]  They're not going to release one that kills 80% the next round.
[00:23:35.349 --> 00:23:41.113]  They release one that kills 1% as I said they do 20 years ago, then they beta test, they release another one that'll kill 20%.
[00:23:41.113 --> 00:23:46.516]  Then people will really be scared and accept the permanent lockdown.
[00:23:46.516 --> 00:23:58.465]  Then once you're in the new permanent lockdown, once you accept that, once the combat robots are in the streets, once everything's controlled, once the carbon tracking's in place, once the medical ID's in place,
[00:23:59.847 --> 00:24:09.175]  Within two years of that being in place, they will release multiple, because they know certain percentages are immune.
[00:24:09.175 --> 00:24:12.758]  They'll release a mousepox that they've weaponized that kills 90 plus percent.
[00:24:12.758 --> 00:24:19.083]  They'll release a super COVID that kills 80 percent.
[00:24:19.083 --> 00:24:20.124]  I've studied the enemy a long time.
[00:24:20.124 --> 00:24:25.429]  I think they'll release three bio weapons at once that they obviously have the cure for, but you won't be given it.
[00:24:25.429 --> 00:24:27.891]  And they'll believe that with three bio attack setting,
[00:24:28.897 --> 00:24:32.867]  And the media control of the beta test have corporate media and big tech sensor.
[00:24:32.867 --> 00:24:35.253]  They'll be able to have you locked down and carry this out.
[00:24:35.253 --> 00:24:36.596]  So you've been told their plan.
[00:24:38.032 --> 00:24:50.537]  It's there, and I just want to ask people that get a paycheck at the media, or a paycheck at the Justice Department, or a paycheck wherever, where you go along with this, why not be like Senator Paul, or DeSantis, or his Surgeon General?
[00:24:50.537 --> 00:24:52.938]  Why not be involved in self-preservation?
[00:24:52.938 --> 00:25:05.023]  The globalists say they want to kill you, they run depopulation agendas, they've been caught releasing bioweapons, they've been caught giving you poison shots, they've been caught lying to Congress, saying they're not developing superweapons, and then here it is again!
[00:25:05.023 --> 00:25:05.923]  And here's my frustration.
[00:25:06.991 --> 00:25:12.015]  They've been hiding in plain view for a long time, so in case it came out, they'd say, oh, no big deal.
[00:25:12.015 --> 00:25:15.018]  Yeah, we produced a mousepox kills 90 plus percent.
[00:25:15.018 --> 00:25:20.663]  Yeah, we produced a COVID that kills 80 percent.
[00:25:20.663 --> 00:25:25.146]  What's the big deal?
[00:25:25.146 --> 00:25:30.751]  And China's the beta test for the martial law, so I'll announce it again in case you just tuned in.
[00:25:30.751 --> 00:25:31.532]  They've now come out.
[00:25:32.389 --> 00:25:42.954]  Getting ahead of whistleblowers that have gone public to Congress, we know behind the scenes, that's about to happen, come out, and said, okay, yeah, we did gain a function at Boston Medical School.
[00:25:42.954 --> 00:25:45.016]  Yeah, and it kills 80% of you.
[00:25:45.016 --> 00:25:47.417]  That's not 12 Monkeys, a movie.
[00:25:47.417 --> 00:25:52.619]  That's the real world, boys and girls.
[00:25:52.619 --> 00:25:57.342]  You think you're going to be protected because you're in the FBI, or you're a federal marshal, or you're a bureaucrat?
[00:25:59.275 --> 00:26:04.416]  The globalists are going to wipe you out along with all of us and we're just going to sit here like we're in a cult?
[00:26:04.416 --> 00:26:05.677]  Like we're in Stockholm Syndrome?
[00:26:05.677 --> 00:26:10.078]  Like we're at Jim Jones' Guiana facility and we're going to drink the cyanide-laced Kool-Aid?
[00:26:10.078 --> 00:26:11.118]  Really?
[00:26:11.118 --> 00:26:14.219]  Really?
[00:26:14.219 --> 00:26:17.300]  That's why they've attacked me more than anybody because they know I'm on to them.
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.021]  I've got their number and they want you to be inoculated psychologically that when you hear something from Alex Jones, you don't listen.
[00:26:23.848 --> 00:26:26.551]  That's why they moved heaven and earth to demonize me.
[00:26:26.551 --> 00:26:30.114]  Because they know what I already said is already out there, and they're going to do it.
[00:26:30.114 --> 00:26:32.196]  So even if they put me in prison or killed me, that won't work.
[00:26:32.196 --> 00:26:33.257]  It turns me into a martyr.
[00:26:33.257 --> 00:26:38.442]  They need to demonize me fully so you won't listen and stop them.
[00:26:38.442 --> 00:26:39.944]  12 Monkeys Global Emergency Alert.
[00:26:39.944 --> 00:26:45.929]  Global has secretly developed super-COVID that kills 80% of those exposed at Boston Lamb.
[00:26:45.929 --> 00:26:47.311]  You might want to share that link.
[00:26:48.874 --> 00:26:49.755]  Here's the Daily Mail.
[00:26:49.755 --> 00:26:50.355]  It's in Reuters.
[00:26:50.355 --> 00:26:50.975]  It's in AP.
[00:26:50.975 --> 00:26:52.556]  They're like, oh, it's not a big deal.
[00:26:52.556 --> 00:26:54.017]  Daily Mail got it right, though.
[00:26:54.017 --> 00:27:04.004]  Outrage as Boston University creates COVID strain that has an 80% kill rate in mice-human chimera clones.
[00:27:04.004 --> 00:27:05.145]  This is playing with fire.
[00:27:05.145 --> 00:27:07.146]  It could spark a lab-generated pandemic.
[00:27:07.146 --> 00:27:08.147]  Oh, think so?
[00:27:08.147 --> 00:27:12.110]  Experts slam Boston Lab where scientists have created a new deadly COVID strain with 80% kill rate.
[00:27:14.198 --> 00:27:20.864]  Bill Gates funded it, Peter Daszak's involved, Anthony Fauci, always the same criminals.
[00:27:20.864 --> 00:27:28.110]  Boston University scientists were today condemned for playing with fire after it emerged they had created a lethal new COVID strain in a laboratory.
[00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:40.000]  Daily Mail revealed that the team had made the hybrid virus combined with Omicron, this is the newest version, they've been doing it for five years, and the original Wuhan strain that killed 80% of mice in a study.
[00:27:40.882 --> 00:27:46.265]  The revelation exposes how dangerous virus manipulation research continues to go on even in the U.S.
[00:27:46.265 --> 00:27:49.087]  despite fears similar practices may have started the pandemic.
[00:27:49.087 --> 00:27:50.408]  May have.
[00:27:50.408 --> 00:27:51.869]  Now let's go back here.
[00:27:51.869 --> 00:28:00.914]  I remember 14 years ago, making a big deal about it, and the headlines, I was able to find it this morning, this was 14 years ago, but you can look it up, we're going to find it.
[00:28:00.914 --> 00:28:02.776]  I said 10 minutes because I was busy.
[00:28:02.776 --> 00:28:03.716]  I spent an hour, I'll find it.
[00:28:03.716 --> 00:28:05.857]  The crew had no luck either.
[00:28:05.857 --> 00:28:09.840]  And the headlines in the Australian, I remember it was in the Australian when I covered it,
[00:28:10.945 --> 00:28:24.772]  Australian.au was university criticized for releasing genetic code of mousepox that kills 90 plus percent.
[00:28:24.772 --> 00:28:29.334]  That was the headline.
[00:28:29.334 --> 00:28:32.976]  And they said, why would you develop this and then put the code out?
[00:28:32.976 --> 00:28:37.538]  Because now they can genetically synthetically make things.
[00:28:37.538 --> 00:28:40.440]  For plausible deniability when they release it.
[00:28:42.079 --> 00:28:43.579]  They just hit you with the beta test.
[00:28:43.579 --> 00:28:45.320]  They just hit you with the poison shot.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:48.020]  And now they're gearing up for even more.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:51.201]  Jack Posoba is going to cover this and the waterfront with us.
[00:28:51.201 --> 00:28:53.321]  Straight ahead, InfoWars.com.
[00:28:53.321 --> 00:28:55.221]  Tomorrow's news today.
[00:28:55.221 --> 00:29:00.142]  Take the live feeds and share it now.
[00:29:00.142 --> 00:29:06.203]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[00:29:06.203 --> 00:29:09.284]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore
[00:29:10.418 --> 00:29:15.321]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[00:29:15.321 --> 00:29:18.844]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[00:29:18.844 --> 00:29:19.704]  It's game over.
[00:29:19.704 --> 00:29:25.408]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[00:29:25.408 --> 00:29:30.012]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[00:29:30.012 --> 00:29:36.156]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[00:29:36.636 --> 00:29:48.600]  And that's why when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.

[00:29:54.722 --> 00:29:56.523]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[00:30:00.006 --> 00:30:03.487]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[00:30:03.487 --> 00:30:06.607]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[00:30:06.607 --> 00:30:08.228]  Now, I knew that.
[00:30:08.228 --> 00:30:12.888]  And for 28 years, I've been on air exposing these people, and together we've had a great effect.
[00:30:12.888 --> 00:30:14.929]  But listen, they're coming after us right now.
[00:30:14.929 --> 00:30:19.770]  They're trying to shut us down, but they can't beat the power of we the people, of you and I together.
[00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:26.751]  So please visit InfoWarsTore.com and get incredible, game-changing products, while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:30:27.051 --> 00:30:27.511]  We're good to go.

[00:30:50.726 --> 00:30:52.708]  This is by far the biggest sell of the year.
[00:30:52.708 --> 00:30:53.589]  Keeps us on air.
[00:30:53.589 --> 00:30:54.690]  Plus, they're great products.
[00:30:54.690 --> 00:30:57.532]  Check them out at InfoWareStore.com with promo code 1776.
[00:30:59.878 --> 00:31:11.182]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[00:31:11.182 --> 00:31:13.082]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[00:31:13.082 --> 00:31:14.543]  That's what they want to take away.
[00:31:14.543 --> 00:31:16.063]  Your ability to speak freely.
[00:31:16.063 --> 00:31:17.784]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[00:31:17.784 --> 00:31:19.044]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[00:31:19.044 --> 00:31:20.425]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[00:31:20.865 --> 00:31:25.709]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[00:31:25.709 --> 00:31:28.091]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[00:31:28.091 --> 00:31:30.113]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[00:31:30.113 --> 00:31:37.059]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[00:31:37.699 --> 00:31:43.083]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[00:31:43.083 --> 00:31:52.030]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[00:31:52.030 --> 00:31:59.716]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[00:31:59.716 --> 00:32:02.578]  I don't promote things unless they really work.
[00:32:02.578 --> 00:32:04.480]  When it comes to politics or culture,
[00:32:05.703 --> 00:32:06.323]  Economics.
[00:32:06.323 --> 00:32:09.444]  We are always the cutting edge, the tip of the spear.
[00:32:09.444 --> 00:32:13.385]  And when we talk about the products at InfoRestore.com, they all blow you away.
[00:32:13.385 --> 00:32:17.847]  If you'll just take them, if you'll just try them, I know you'll be with big customers.
[00:32:17.847 --> 00:32:22.048]  And finally, one of our best-selling products, sold out for months, it's back in stock, it's X3.
[00:32:22.048 --> 00:32:32.711]  It's all three types of the very best atomic iodine out there that supercharges your energy, your stamina, your libido, and number one, your immune system.
[00:32:32.711 --> 00:32:35.092]  So X3, despite the fact that it's run on iodine,
[00:32:35.692 --> 00:32:44.982]  It's still on sale at 50% off right now at InfoWarStore.com, and it funds the Info War, which is a 360 win.
[00:32:44.982 --> 00:32:51.529]  If you've not experienced the power of iodine, it takes two weeks to kick it on average, you've got to go to InfoWarStore.com and get X3 50% off.
[00:32:51.529 --> 00:32:52.249]  X3 50% off, InfoWarStore.com.
[00:33:00.911 --> 00:33:05.527]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[00:33:05.527 --> 00:33:06.832]  It's Alex Jones!
[00:33:27.402 --> 00:33:32.905]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:32.905 --> 00:33:37.607]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:42.404 --> 00:33:52.106]  Jack Posobiec's coming up to lay out the latest developments with the war in Ukraine, the economy, the midterms 20 days out, and so much more.
[00:33:52.106 --> 00:34:00.668]  But our number one gigantic over-the-top story is the admission that Anthony Fauci and others lied to Congress about gain-of-function research.
[00:34:00.668 --> 00:34:03.169]  Now secret projects they ran with Bill Gates funding
[00:34:03.729 --> 00:34:06.330]  It's being reported by the Associated Press, Reuters, you name it.
[00:34:06.330 --> 00:34:15.375]  Outrage as Boston University creates COVID strain that kills 80% of humans in humanized mice human clones.
[00:34:15.375 --> 00:34:18.256]  Absolutely insane, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:34:18.256 --> 00:34:19.357]  That is what's going on.
[00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:23.439]  And we were able to pull up information I talked about decades ago.
[00:34:24.753 --> 00:34:33.079]  Where they released the genetic sequencing on how to synthetically make a mousepox that kills 90 plus percent of humans.
[00:34:33.079 --> 00:34:34.820]  This is what's going on.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.981]  And they deny they're making it in labs.
[00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:38.662]  It is more dangerous than nuclear weapons.
[00:34:38.662 --> 00:34:41.564]  It's got to be stopped right now.
[00:34:41.564 --> 00:34:43.566]  So we're going to be covering that in a moment.
[00:34:43.566 --> 00:34:48.449]  But remember, the people running this operation want global depopulation.
[00:34:48.449 --> 00:34:54.193]  That's why my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World, has been number one the last two months off and on to the top 50 consecutively.
[00:34:55.157 --> 00:35:13.789]  The book is incredible, and now it's available at Amazon.com on audiobook, and of course, you can buy signed copies of the book as a fundraiser at InfoWarsTore.com, or also buy the book there with the audiobook now available on hundreds of different platforms to the chagrin of the establishment.
[00:35:13.789 --> 00:35:15.710]  Also, we've only got a few days left on this.
[00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:18.051]  We've got to end the sale because a bunch of the products are about to sell out.
[00:35:18.051 --> 00:35:20.413]  Some of the stuff will continue on, but the big sale will end.
[00:35:21.497 --> 00:35:26.879]  Storewide 40-50% off with promo code 1776, an additional 10% off.
[00:35:26.879 --> 00:35:29.319]  That's 50% off on X3.
[00:35:29.319 --> 00:35:32.040]  That's 60% with the promo code.
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:34.381]  That's 60% off on Vitamin Mineral Fusion.
[00:35:34.381 --> 00:35:36.962]  That's 60% off on DNA Force Plus.
[00:35:36.962 --> 00:35:42.904]  These are top-of-the-line products that are on record to empower your cells, empower your immunity, and supercharge your body.
[00:35:42.904 --> 00:35:43.824]  Going into the fall and winter,
[00:35:44.364 --> 00:35:48.089]  It is a very smart thing to do, plus it supports the broadcast.
[00:35:48.089 --> 00:35:48.670]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:49.951]  Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:35:49.951 --> 00:35:51.553]  So, I mentioned this earlier and again.
[00:36:04.528 --> 00:36:15.417]  Chapel Hill, Obama, 2015, their own scientists go public and say they're weaponizing SARS to make it highly infective, transmit to humans, and kill large numbers.
[00:36:15.417 --> 00:36:23.103]  Then we learned they were developing in Wuhan, even called it COVID-19, six months before it was released, in their own codes and emails.
[00:36:23.103 --> 00:36:30.589]  So they even used the name they were using for COVID-19 that is way, way, way weaker than the other strains that they've got.
[00:36:31.533 --> 00:36:43.084]  So there's all those clips of Fauci and the rest of them up there in Congress telling Senator Paul that, oh no, we never did this, when they have the documents, they have the records, and now it's mainstream news.
[00:36:43.084 --> 00:36:53.033]  They claim it's part of bioweapons research to treat people who've been hit by a bioweapon, when these things are so incredibly specific.
[00:36:53.033 --> 00:36:56.056]  How would the Chinese or Russians or somebody create the exact
[00:36:56.716 --> 00:37:01.858]  virus out of billions of different combinations that supposedly they're making vaccines for.
[00:37:01.858 --> 00:37:14.244]  These are bioweapon programs disguised as biodefense, but regardless, they are completely and absolutely illegal under U.S.
[00:37:14.244 --> 00:37:15.325]  and international law.
[00:37:15.325 --> 00:37:16.645]  So I went over that.
[00:37:16.645 --> 00:37:21.268]  Here's some of the background news and information that I was mentioning earlier.
[00:37:22.265 --> 00:37:25.788]  Australians create deadly mouse virus.
[00:37:25.788 --> 00:37:28.169]  New York Times, 2001.
[00:37:28.169 --> 00:37:29.270]  I said 15 years ago.
[00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:32.532]  It was 21 years ago that I remember covering this.
[00:37:32.532 --> 00:37:34.494]  Oh, it was accidental.
[00:37:34.494 --> 00:37:39.898]  They created a mouse pox that kills the vast majority of the mice.
[00:37:39.898 --> 00:37:44.741]  Bioterror researchers build a more lethal mouse pox.
[00:37:44.741 --> 00:37:45.041]  2003.
[00:37:45.041 --> 00:37:51.426]  But the news was 15 years ago when the universities developed it in Australia and in New Jersey in the US.
[00:37:54.198 --> 00:37:55.079]  We're good to go.
[00:38:11.092 --> 00:38:11.772]  Why would you release it?
[00:38:11.772 --> 00:38:13.693]  For plausible deniability.
[00:38:13.693 --> 00:38:16.975]  Killer mousepox virus raises bioterror fears.
[00:38:16.975 --> 00:38:17.855]  New York Post.
[00:38:17.855 --> 00:38:18.735]  Leningradian.
[00:38:18.735 --> 00:38:21.036]  Lab created killer virus by accident.
[00:38:21.036 --> 00:38:22.917]  It's an accident!
[00:38:22.917 --> 00:38:27.179]  But now they say at Boston University it wasn't an accident.
[00:38:27.179 --> 00:38:30.440]  They did it on purpose.
[00:38:30.440 --> 00:38:33.662]  But to keep you safe, of course.
[00:38:33.662 --> 00:38:36.503]  While they told Congress they weren't doing it.
[00:38:37.839 --> 00:38:43.424]  Scientist research antidotes to super mouth pox virus that they created.
[00:38:43.424 --> 00:38:45.626]  It goes on and on from there.
[00:38:45.626 --> 00:38:46.287]  And now we have...
[00:38:47.003 --> 00:38:59.046]  Jack Posobiec, who's former Naval Intelligence, one of the brain folks behind Trump's victory, and one of the most prolific people in the world now, reaching millions and millions of people a day.
[00:38:59.046 --> 00:39:03.166]  I know I'm going to be on his Sunday show, look forward to that.
[00:39:03.166 --> 00:39:07.347]  Wow, Jack, we're going to go to break here in a few minutes, and it's great to have you.
[00:39:07.347 --> 00:39:08.268]  Where do you want to start?
[00:39:08.268 --> 00:39:14.749]  Russia, the economy, this Boston University bombshell, the midterms, what do you want to hit first?
[00:39:15.765 --> 00:39:27.015]  Well, Steve, the main thing I want to talk about is Steve Bannon, yourself, these show trials that we've seen, the rise of show trial justice here in America.
[00:39:27.015 --> 00:39:34.621]  I mean, this is like Beria under the NKVD and his famous quote, show me the man and I will show you the crime.
[00:39:34.621 --> 00:39:35.742]  So we're seeing Steve Bannon.
[00:39:36.471 --> 00:39:38.973]  They are going to lock him up this Friday.
[00:39:38.973 --> 00:39:42.036]  Garland wants a six-month sentence for him.
[00:39:42.036 --> 00:39:43.757]  They want to put him behind bars.
[00:39:43.757 --> 00:39:46.479]  And we saw what happened to Jeffrey Epstein behind bars.
[00:39:46.479 --> 00:39:50.603]  They want him shut up for the midterms because they see what he's done.
[00:39:50.603 --> 00:39:52.845]  They see the power of the War Room Posse.
[00:39:52.845 --> 00:39:54.626]  They see the power of what you've done.
[00:39:54.626 --> 00:39:56.047]  That's why they've come after you.
[00:39:56.047 --> 00:40:02.273]  And they've seen the power of other platforms out there like myself over at Human Events Daily, Charlie Kirk at Turning Point, Tucker, etc.
[00:40:02.973 --> 00:40:06.974]  They're putting all of us in the exact same boat.
[00:40:06.974 --> 00:40:08.074]  Why are they doing this?
[00:40:08.074 --> 00:40:09.035]  It's simple.
[00:40:09.035 --> 00:40:10.895]  Because they are cracking down.
[00:40:10.895 --> 00:40:13.035]  And you said it yourself the other day.
[00:40:13.035 --> 00:40:16.076]  The propaganda would not be necessary if they were winning.
[00:40:16.076 --> 00:40:20.897]  What I would add to that, the crackdowns would not be necessary if they were winning.
[00:40:20.897 --> 00:40:30.900]  They're seeing more people than ever are now tuning into the truth and they are waking up to the fact that our countries have been taken over by this
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:32.681]  We're good.
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:58.703]  They tried to take our equipment, stop the camera, show us the footage, tried to take my guys out.
[00:40:58.703 --> 00:40:59.724]  Why is that?
[00:40:59.724 --> 00:41:00.104]  Why is that?
[00:41:00.104 --> 00:41:01.345]  I'll tell you exactly why that is.
[00:41:01.345 --> 00:41:02.586]  Not because of what we were doing.
[00:41:02.586 --> 00:41:09.191]  We were standing there filming, you know, I was wearing a jacket and a pair of sunglasses and standing in front of the camera talking, you know, kind of like a reporter.
[00:41:10.123 --> 00:41:10.363]  It wasn't
[00:41:31.291 --> 00:41:31.851]  I don't know.
[00:41:56.958 --> 00:42:00.382]  The guy who was the source of the fake, dirty dossier.
[00:42:00.382 --> 00:42:03.104]  Jake Tapper was out there putting it out on CNN.
[00:42:03.104 --> 00:42:04.206]  He lies to the FBI.
[00:42:04.206 --> 00:42:05.507]  He lies up and down.
[00:42:05.507 --> 00:42:07.028]  They let him walk.
[00:42:07.028 --> 00:42:13.835]  The very same week, they're going to frog march Steve Bannon in, and they want to put him in chains, and they want to put him behind bars.
[00:42:15.146 --> 00:42:16.607]  Why are they able to do this?
[00:42:16.607 --> 00:42:22.931]  Because the Republicans, by the way, by and large, have not set up a system to counteract any of it.
[00:42:22.931 --> 00:42:28.575]  And because the left is moving farther and farther and farther because they know, by the way, that you don't believe the propaganda anymore.
[00:42:28.575 --> 00:42:30.276]  They already know.
[00:42:30.276 --> 00:42:31.557]  They already get that.
[00:42:31.557 --> 00:42:41.404]  So the only powers, Alex, that they have left is the power of fines, the power of levies, and the cold, hard, brutal power of being able to go and raid a pro-life
[00:42:41.884 --> 00:42:45.446]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[00:43:07.150 --> 00:43:20.959]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[00:43:20.959 --> 00:43:35.008]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout so you get an additional 10% off.

[00:44:12.879 --> 00:44:14.521]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[00:44:14.521 --> 00:44:21.748]  And over the years you have come to the table, you have stepped to the plate so many times and kept InfoWars and free speech on the air and I thank you.
[00:44:22.188 --> 00:44:26.772]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[00:44:26.772 --> 00:44:27.913]  And I need your support.
[00:44:27.913 --> 00:44:35.560]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com

[00:44:44.383 --> 00:44:48.925]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making, is almost over.
[00:44:48.925 --> 00:44:53.146]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[00:44:53.146 --> 00:45:00.549]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom and justice in the future, go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[00:45:02.402 --> 00:45:07.306]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[00:45:07.306 --> 00:45:13.712]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[00:45:13.712 --> 00:45:18.836]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[00:45:18.836 --> 00:45:20.537]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[00:45:20.537 --> 00:45:26.963]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we've had this success.
[00:45:27.683 --> 00:45:33.106]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[00:45:33.106 --> 00:45:37.428]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[00:45:37.428 --> 00:45:46.652]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[00:45:46.652 --> 00:45:48.012]  God bless you all.
[00:45:48.012 --> 00:45:49.053]  I salute you.
[00:45:49.053 --> 00:45:49.913]  I thank you.
[00:45:49.913 --> 00:45:55.876]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[00:45:56.156 --> 00:45:57.497]  The fight is my fight.
[00:45:57.497 --> 00:45:58.117]  It's your fight.
[00:45:58.117 --> 00:45:58.877]  It's our fight.
[00:45:58.877 --> 00:46:00.938]  God bless you all.
[00:46:00.938 --> 00:46:04.439]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[00:46:04.439 --> 00:46:07.561]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[00:46:07.561 --> 00:46:09.181]  Now, I knew that.
[00:46:09.181 --> 00:46:12.003]  And for 28 years, I've been on air exposing these people.
[00:46:12.003 --> 00:46:13.443]  And together, we've had a great effect.
[00:46:13.443 --> 00:46:14.764]  But listen.
[00:46:14.764 --> 00:46:15.924]  They're coming after us right now.
[00:46:15.924 --> 00:46:17.065]  They're trying to shut us down.
[00:46:17.065 --> 00:46:19.466]  But they can't beat the power of we the people.
[00:46:19.466 --> 00:46:20.186]  Of you and I together.

[00:47:01.471 --> 00:47:07.376]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:47:19.594 --> 00:47:21.035]  Well, Jack Posobiec's prolific.
[00:47:21.035 --> 00:47:22.476]  He's got TPUSA.
[00:47:22.476 --> 00:47:23.937]  He does human events.
[00:47:23.937 --> 00:47:25.198]  He co-hosts with Steve Bannon.
[00:47:25.198 --> 00:47:25.739]  So much more.
[00:47:25.739 --> 00:47:27.680]  And, of course, dominates Twitter.
[00:47:30.626 --> 00:47:39.130]  And out of all the cornucopia I threw out, he said, no one will talk about censorship because if we don't have a voice with our popular true information, we will be crushed.
[00:47:39.130 --> 00:47:53.216]  And now the lawyer that he mentioned, we'll play a clip in a moment, that works for the Democrats, that's suing Kanye West for 200 plus million dollars because Kanye quoted the coroner's report that he didn't die from a physical attack by the police and probably fentanyl and methamphetamine.
[00:47:53.216 --> 00:47:54.637]  Why is Kanye being singled out?
[00:47:54.637 --> 00:47:59.999]  Because he is not going along with the establishment agenda, whether you agree with all the statements or not.
[00:48:01.459 --> 00:48:05.401]  I don't agree with all of Ye's statements, but he has a right to say them.
[00:48:05.401 --> 00:48:08.042]  Jack Posobiec, TPUSA.com.
[00:48:08.042 --> 00:48:23.487]  I want to cover the waterfront here of the censorship of therapeutics, the censorship of the lockdowns, the censorship of the shots not working, and now Boston University with super weaponized gain-of-function COVID that kills 80% of those that come in contact with it.
[00:48:23.487 --> 00:48:24.567]  Just unbelievable.
[00:48:24.567 --> 00:48:25.307]  You got caught off.
[00:48:25.307 --> 00:48:27.328]  Please continue about where we are as a race.
[00:48:28.712 --> 00:48:29.874]  Well, I think that's exactly right.
[00:48:29.874 --> 00:48:37.804]  And these chimeric viruses that they're creating, these super viruses, they aren't even doing it in China anymore because the cat's out of the bag on that.
[00:48:37.804 --> 00:48:41.329]  Again, they know what they're doing.
[00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:43.913]  They know that you know what they're doing.
[00:48:44.617 --> 00:48:46.357]  They don't think you're stupid.
[00:48:46.357 --> 00:48:49.158]  They think that you won't be able to stop them.
[00:48:49.158 --> 00:48:50.839]  That you won't do anything about it.
[00:48:50.839 --> 00:48:55.620]  That you're just going to sit back and watch whatever comes up on Netflix, whatever the next streaming thing is.
[00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:57.240]  You're just going to swipe on Instagram.
[00:48:57.240 --> 00:48:58.641]  You're going to swipe on TikTok.
[00:48:58.641 --> 00:49:00.021]  They're going to suck you in.
[00:49:00.021 --> 00:49:07.663]  By the way, TikTok is actually a mind control device that was sent by the CCP directly affecting our children.
[00:49:07.663 --> 00:49:11.344]  It's an attack on them the same way fentanyl is attacked directly on our children.
[00:49:11.804 --> 00:49:16.088]  That's mind control, arguably in both sentences when you're talking about chemical dependency.
[00:49:16.088 --> 00:49:23.113]  But what they're doing, what they're seeing here Alex, is a new situation where these viruses are coming out.
[00:49:23.113 --> 00:49:28.658]  They're doing this, they're doing this research, they claim in the name of safety, they claim in the name of help.
[00:49:28.658 --> 00:49:35.864]  Okay, well when this thing hits, when one of these things leaks out of the lab, one of these super viruses, where's the, where's the blueprint?
[00:49:36.454 --> 00:49:38.476]  Where's the on-the-shelf treatment for it?
[00:49:38.476 --> 00:49:40.798]  Where's the, oh, you just grab one of these, you'll be fine.
[00:49:40.798 --> 00:49:41.579]  Isn't that the whole point?
[00:49:41.579 --> 00:49:45.502]  That's why you were just playing the 12 Monkeys music there, as a matter of fact.
[00:49:45.502 --> 00:49:52.768]  And, you know, again, in 12 Monkeys, that's a virus that gets released at strategic points throughout the entire globe.
[00:49:52.768 --> 00:49:53.689]  Why do they have this?
[00:49:53.689 --> 00:49:54.990]  Why are they building things like this?
[00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:56.652]  They tell us it's for our safety.
[00:49:56.652 --> 00:50:01.596]  And yet it seems as though these chimeric viruses, which, by the way, Alex, and for anybody
[00:50:02.517 --> 00:50:11.707]  There's been one person who's consistently talked about this for 30 years, and that's been Alex Jones, talking about chimeric viruses, the synthesis between these.
[00:50:11.707 --> 00:50:14.690]  You covered the elites merger.
[00:50:14.690 --> 00:50:16.532]  They call it elite capture at the beginning.
[00:50:16.532 --> 00:50:19.155]  I would call it an elite merger now with the CCP.
[00:50:19.155 --> 00:50:20.977]  You covered that, Alex, in real time.
[00:50:21.437 --> 00:50:26.620]  So I want to say to the people who want us to have a problem with saying, oh, well, how can you let Alex Jones on your show?
[00:50:26.620 --> 00:50:29.482]  And Alex, you and I have a big interview that's going to drop this Sunday.
[00:50:29.482 --> 00:50:31.283]  By the way, an hour long interview.
[00:50:31.283 --> 00:50:32.484]  We're doing this thing.
[00:50:32.484 --> 00:50:34.125]  Alex and I pre-recorded the entire thing.
[00:50:34.125 --> 00:50:35.306]  We talk about God.
[00:50:35.306 --> 00:50:36.167]  We talk about faith.
[00:50:36.167 --> 00:50:37.668]  We talk about why we do what we do.
[00:50:37.668 --> 00:50:39.449]  We talk about advice for young men.
[00:50:39.449 --> 00:50:42.150]  We go, we cover the waterfront, but we get into so many issues.
[00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:44.252]  This is going to be absolutely fantastic.
[00:50:44.252 --> 00:50:46.093]  It drops, the podcast drops at 10 a.m.
[00:50:46.093 --> 00:50:47.154]  on Human Events Daily.
[00:50:47.154 --> 00:50:49.095]  And then the video is going to go up on Real America's Voice.
[00:50:49.455 --> 00:50:56.024]  At 6 p.m., we're going to broadcast it worldwide across all the streaming, all the platforms, because people need to understand.
[00:50:56.024 --> 00:51:01.152]  They need to understand that you don't have to live in this world that they are creating for you.
[00:51:01.152 --> 00:51:03.575]  Look, the end of the fourth turning, right?
[00:51:03.575 --> 00:51:04.917]  The end of... I wrote Strauss' Half Theory.
[00:51:05.501 --> 00:51:06.221]  The four turnings.
[00:51:06.221 --> 00:51:07.402]  We're in a fourth turning.
[00:51:07.402 --> 00:51:10.724]  The end of the fourth turning, the 80-year cycle, is always what?
[00:51:10.724 --> 00:51:13.405]  The creation of new institutions.
[00:51:13.405 --> 00:51:14.886]  The creation of new institutions.
[00:51:14.886 --> 00:51:18.848]  And Alex, you've got the new book out, The Great Reset, that explains.
[00:51:18.848 --> 00:51:21.989]  They understand exactly what's going on.
[00:51:21.989 --> 00:51:24.771]  That's why they've tried to force the fourth turning.
[00:51:25.191 --> 00:51:28.152]  But the problem for them is, of course, there's people that don't want to go along with it.
[00:51:28.152 --> 00:51:34.355]  There's people like Putin, there's people like Xi Jinping, the Saudis, who are saying, you know, we're going to call your bluff because we see what you've done.
[00:51:34.355 --> 00:51:37.717]  You've created this global empire, but we're going to break off from it.
[00:51:37.717 --> 00:51:38.897]  And then the Chinese are going to come in.
[00:51:38.897 --> 00:51:40.158]  They're going to take over it.
[00:51:40.783 --> 00:51:44.745]  So, what people have to understand is that you can check out of all of this.
[00:51:44.745 --> 00:51:53.990]  You can check all of this by reliance on God, by working on yourself, by focusing on yourself, by focusing on what you yourself can control.
[00:51:53.990 --> 00:52:00.153]  And once you break free of the mind grip that they have you in, then you can attain true freedom.
[00:52:01.567 --> 00:52:07.591]  Jack, I really respect your analysis and I just, I mean, I literally live on your Twitter and watch your show every day.
[00:52:07.591 --> 00:52:12.034]  I mean, literally every day I watch what you're saying and you were always smart.
[00:52:12.034 --> 00:52:17.899]  I've known you for about seven years, but you've really, I know you're a father, you've got two children, you're married.
[00:52:17.899 --> 00:52:23.162]  There's something about having children that takes you to the next level because now you're really worried about them and it kicks you into high gear.
[00:52:23.162 --> 00:52:26.465]  So you were already in a really high gear and now you've gone into overdrive here.
[00:52:27.205 --> 00:52:31.691]  Big picture, how do you think the globalists are doing versus the human populist awakening?
[00:52:31.691 --> 00:52:42.986]  How would you call this right now, say at halftime, in this battle for the future between Team Renaissance, Team Enlightenment, Team Great Awakening, and Team Great Reset, Team Build Back Better?
[00:52:44.301 --> 00:52:45.462]  Well, here's the thing, right?
[00:52:45.462 --> 00:52:48.383]  The globalists know that the jig is up.
[00:52:48.383 --> 00:52:50.344]  So they've gone full mask off.
[00:52:50.344 --> 00:52:52.706]  Klaus Schwab will go up there and say everything that he wants to say.
[00:52:52.706 --> 00:52:57.328]  He'll point out everything, you know, whatever words he has to say about Ukraine to get the $80 billion over there.
[00:52:57.328 --> 00:53:02.431]  You're going to eat mugs, you'll owe nothing, you'll love it, I mean, yeah.
[00:53:02.431 --> 00:53:07.134]  Yeah, but they'll never talk about Taiwan because the island of Taiwan, that's been given.
[00:53:07.134 --> 00:53:09.435]  That's been given as a dowry to the CCP.
[00:53:10.140 --> 00:53:12.281]  That's been given as a dowry to the CCP elites.
[00:53:12.281 --> 00:53:14.762]  The island of Taiwan, the free island, that's done.
[00:53:14.762 --> 00:53:15.162]  They don't care.
[00:53:15.162 --> 00:53:16.122]  They already gave them Hong Kong.
[00:53:16.122 --> 00:53:17.423]  They're going to give them Taiwan next.
[00:53:17.423 --> 00:53:18.643]  You know it's coming.
[00:53:18.643 --> 00:53:22.764]  That will be taken by the CCP and I guarantee you, the West, Biden, they don't care.
[00:53:22.764 --> 00:53:23.845]  They're not going to fight back.
[00:53:23.845 --> 00:53:23.985]  Why?
[00:53:23.985 --> 00:53:25.826]  They're making money off of all this.
[00:53:25.826 --> 00:53:34.128]  So they're trying to get out as much as they can before the fourth turning ends, before the fourth turning hits on them.
[00:53:34.128 --> 00:53:35.429]  So are they winning?
[00:53:35.429 --> 00:53:37.090]  Are we winning?
[00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:38.270]  I don't think they're winning right now.
[00:53:39.096 --> 00:53:42.077]  I think they realize that it's a race.
[00:53:42.077 --> 00:53:44.038]  I would actually look at it this way, as a race, right?
[00:53:44.038 --> 00:53:48.599]  Not necessarily an arms race, but a foot race to the finish line.
[00:53:48.599 --> 00:53:51.380]  Who is going to have more power at the end?
[00:53:51.380 --> 00:53:53.881]  The elites, the corrupt elites, or the people?
[00:53:54.341 --> 00:54:04.407]  If we the people can get our own, obviously the elected leaders when you're looking at the elections, the institutional leaders when you're talking about the institutions, you have to go back to basics.
[00:54:04.407 --> 00:54:10.751]  It took them 60 years to really put this in gear and they laid the plans out for this a hundred years.
[00:54:10.751 --> 00:54:17.035]  Go look at Huxley, and by the way Huxley and his brother Julian Huxley, if you really want to understand where this all came from.
[00:54:17.035 --> 00:54:18.216]  Go look at Crowley and all the rest of it.
[00:54:19.008 --> 00:54:39.057]  But what you need to know, what you need to know, is because there's a, when I see an awakening going on across Europe, when I see Italy, when I see Brazil, what's going on down there and why they're trying to take out Bolsonaro so hard right now, he did very well in the debate this week if everyone saw that, when I see what's going on in all of these other nations, you see people checking out of these programs, you see people checking out of this agenda and saying, whoa, whoa!
[00:54:39.597 --> 00:54:41.158]  We didn't sign up for this.
[00:54:41.158 --> 00:54:42.438]  We don't want this.
[00:54:42.438 --> 00:54:51.441]  We don't want to be cybernetic beings with, you know, hooked up to injection feeds with our children getting the ever-expanding vaccine schedule for them every single year.
[00:54:51.441 --> 00:54:59.764]  They're voting, by the way, tomorrow on introducing this thing in the vaccine schedule for federal programs for every single child that's in the program.
[00:54:59.764 --> 00:55:03.145]  There's a lot of people saying, you know what, it's been too hard, too fast.
[00:55:03.145 --> 00:55:06.706]  Because Alex, there were, oh, it's the frog in the pot theory is what it comes down to.
[00:55:07.870 --> 00:55:09.152]  The frog's in the pot.
[00:55:09.152 --> 00:55:11.875]  If you turn up the water too fast, the frog jumps out.
[00:55:11.875 --> 00:55:13.897]  If you turn it on slowly, the frog never jumps.
[00:55:13.897 --> 00:55:14.978]  The frog becomes boiled, right?
[00:55:14.978 --> 00:55:15.579]  Everyone's heard that.
[00:55:16.388 --> 00:55:23.652]  But in reality it works out a little bit differently because there's always, it's multiple frogs, and there's always some frogs that are a little bit more sensitive to it.
[00:55:23.652 --> 00:55:28.635]  By the way, Media Matters is going to love that here I am on InfoWars talking about frogs with Alex Jones, right?
[00:55:28.635 --> 00:55:33.098]  And so, that one's for you guys.
[00:55:33.098 --> 00:55:40.742]  And so, there's always been some frogs, Alex, that were a little bit more sensitive to this, and they could feel something changing, and they'd say, you know what, this water's getting hot.
[00:55:41.403 --> 00:55:43.365]  This water's getting hot, we should jump out.
[00:55:43.365 --> 00:55:45.326]  This water's getting hot, we should do something about it.
[00:55:45.326 --> 00:55:47.628]  And I think, Alex, that you've been one of those people.
[00:55:47.628 --> 00:55:49.770]  I think Steve Bannon's been one of those people.
[00:55:49.770 --> 00:55:53.213]  I think Donald Trump, obviously, is one of those people.
[00:55:53.213 --> 00:55:56.715]  And I think these awakenings that you're seeing, it's going to continue.
[00:55:56.715 --> 00:56:00.939]  Because everyone can see, everyone can see, that the water's becoming too hot.
[00:56:00.939 --> 00:56:02.480]  They can feel the water's becoming too hot.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.322]  And they also made a key strategic mistake.
[00:56:05.322 --> 00:56:06.783]  And I'm going to explain what that is.
[00:56:06.783 --> 00:56:09.726]  The key strategic mistake they made was going after children.
[00:56:10.385 --> 00:56:16.086]  The sexualization of our children, the transing of our children that we can see going on.
[00:56:16.086 --> 00:56:17.866]  And they post themselves on TikTok.
[00:56:17.866 --> 00:56:20.347]  By the way, that's why they go after Libs of TikTok so much.
[00:56:20.347 --> 00:56:27.828]  They go after her like crazy because she's just posting what they say and brag about publicly that's going on.
[00:56:27.828 --> 00:56:37.750]  By going after children, you are affecting people on a very deep biological, spiritual, evolutionary designed soul level.
[00:56:39.022 --> 00:56:41.023]  A parent's connection with their children.
[00:56:41.023 --> 00:57:03.068]  You just mentioned it, you know, Pozo before having kids to Pozo after having kids, and it's really been watching my wife and seeing the connection that she has with our children, our two little boys, that I know, and as a father, you got to be there, you got to raise them, you have to teach them right, but there is a connection that children have with their mothers and that mothers have with their children from the womb, obviously, right, from that moment of conception.
[00:57:03.068 --> 00:57:03.628]  They already know.
[00:57:04.528 --> 00:57:05.628]  That you cannot break.
[00:57:05.628 --> 00:57:06.669]  That nothing can break.
[00:57:06.669 --> 00:57:10.610]  That is more powerful than anything that the globalists can throw down.
[00:57:10.610 --> 00:57:11.930]  More powerful than any virus.
[00:57:11.930 --> 00:57:13.510]  More powerful than any vaccine.
[00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:17.891]  You will never be able to break the connection between a mother and her child.
[00:57:17.891 --> 00:57:20.032]  Because I believe that it is divine.
[00:57:20.032 --> 00:57:21.832]  I believe it's from divine providence.
[00:57:21.832 --> 00:57:27.194]  And if you cannot sever that, and if you go after it, you are making a strategic mistake.
[00:57:27.194 --> 00:57:28.634]  That will be your downfall.
[00:57:29.247 --> 00:57:29.987]  I totally agree.
[00:57:29.987 --> 00:57:37.110]  I can't tell you how many former liberals over the whole trans, cut girls' breasts off, cut boys' genitals off, has really woke people up.
[00:57:37.110 --> 00:57:39.991]  And you're good at bringing people back to basics.
[00:57:39.991 --> 00:57:40.572]  We need to do this.
[00:57:40.572 --> 00:57:45.874]  Let's talk about what the fourth turning is for folks that don't know and they get into all of it with Jax Posobiec.
[00:57:45.874 --> 00:57:50.376]  Next hour, stay with us.
[00:57:50.376 --> 00:57:51.096]  It's our bestseller.
[00:57:52.213 --> 00:57:55.975]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[00:57:55.975 --> 00:58:05.041]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall bestseller.
[00:58:05.041 --> 00:58:07.103]  And it's been sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock.
[00:58:07.643 --> 00:58:14.287]  Vitamin-mineral fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.

[00:58:21.412 --> 00:58:24.034]  Essential means, without these things, you die.
[00:58:24.034 --> 00:58:31.879]  And so much of the food is debased, there's so many chemicals in the environment, it is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[00:58:32.119 --> 00:58:39.022]  Now there are other great Vitamin Mineral products out there, but this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the MFull World.

[00:58:50.388 --> 00:58:52.769]  Fluoride is the enemy.
[00:58:52.769 --> 00:58:54.350]  It's the bad halogen.
[00:58:54.350 --> 00:58:58.212]  To the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[00:58:58.212 --> 00:58:59.873]  What's the good halogen?
[00:58:59.873 --> 00:59:02.694]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[00:59:46.575 --> 00:59:57.060]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:04.187 --> 01:00:07.288]  All right, Jack Lassovich with us another 30 minutes.
[01:00:07.288 --> 01:00:08.388]  I'm going to try to give him the floor.
[01:00:08.388 --> 01:00:09.689]  This is a short five-minute segment.
[01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.489]  Two more big segments coming up.
[01:00:11.489 --> 01:00:15.091]  But Jack, for folks that don't understand, the globalists admit there are cycles.
[01:00:15.091 --> 01:00:15.711]  They know they're there.
[01:00:15.711 --> 01:00:17.872]  We all know they're there.
[01:00:17.872 --> 01:00:23.734]  The fourth turning's here, and they want their institutions to take over from their old institutions collapsing.
[01:00:23.734 --> 01:00:26.274]  That's why right now is such a critical time.
[01:00:26.274 --> 01:00:33.457]  Can you spend a few minutes explaining to people what Klaus Schwab is talking about when he writes a book called The Fourth Turning and why this is so important?
[01:00:34.508 --> 01:00:40.913]  Right, so Klaus Schwab, he plays this little game with it where he calls it the 4th Industrial Revolution.
[01:00:40.913 --> 01:00:47.358]  But Strauss-Howe, they call it their generational theory, it's the 4th, essentially the 4 turnings.
[01:00:47.358 --> 01:00:52.522]  And that there are 4 generational turnings that come on within, it's pretty much 80 year cycles.
[01:00:52.902 --> 01:01:04.349]  So when you look at the 80-year cycles, you see the American Revolution, you see the Civil War, you see World War II, and now you see the world that we're living through now, the 80th cycle after World War II.
[01:01:04.349 --> 01:01:06.591]  They know the great restructuring is on hand.
[01:01:06.591 --> 01:01:11.294]  By the way, Putin actually kind of referenced this himself in a speech recently.
[01:01:11.294 --> 01:01:12.855]  He was talking about Ukraine, he was talking about
[01:01:13.658 --> 01:01:14.920]  All sorts of other things that are going on.
[01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:20.269]  By the way, they're going total martial law in those four disputed territories right now in Ukraine.
[01:01:20.269 --> 01:01:25.358]  But Putin actually mentioned, he said, the period following World War II has now ended.
[01:01:25.942 --> 01:01:27.262]  He said the period following World War II.
[01:01:27.262 --> 01:01:28.003]  So what's he talking about?
[01:01:28.003 --> 01:01:30.203]  He's talking about that 80-year period.
[01:01:30.203 --> 01:01:33.924]  So people at the high levels, they understand what this is, they understand what we're getting into.
[01:01:33.924 --> 01:01:36.905]  And Trump, Trump is somebody who can understand that energy.
[01:01:36.905 --> 01:01:47.749]  He can understand the energy and knows that when energy is building, when energy is dissipating, he understands entropy, he understands neg-entropy, so when energy is building or when energy is dissipating into a large system.
[01:01:47.749 --> 01:01:52.930]  This fourth turning, these systems, what comes on, you can actually see these cycles.
[01:01:52.930 --> 01:01:54.571]  Now there are memes about this.
[01:01:54.571 --> 01:01:55.091]  They talk about
[01:01:55.831 --> 01:01:57.892]  You know, hard times and good times.
[01:01:57.892 --> 01:02:01.795]  Essentially, bad times create strong men.
[01:02:01.795 --> 01:02:03.556]  Strong men create good times.
[01:02:03.556 --> 01:02:06.358]  Good times create weak men, soft men.
[01:02:06.358 --> 01:02:09.020]  Weak men create hard times again.
[01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:19.527]  And so it's at that point, at that point in the fourth period, in that fourth turning, when it's time for the strong men to rise up again in their communities,
[01:02:20.299 --> 01:02:20.499]  Right?
[01:02:20.499 --> 01:02:21.139]  In their cities.
[01:02:21.139 --> 01:02:24.581]  And I'm not talking about, you know, like Caligula or anything like that.
[01:02:24.581 --> 01:02:27.142]  What I'm talking about is the men.
[01:02:27.142 --> 01:02:30.344]  To actually rediscover who they are and what their role is in society.
[01:02:30.344 --> 01:02:36.246]  And why do you think you see such an attack on strong men and masculinity today in this country?
[01:02:36.246 --> 01:02:38.067]  Okay, why do you see that attack?
[01:02:38.067 --> 01:02:39.188]  And the attack, what do they attack?
[01:02:39.188 --> 01:02:40.328]  They attack police.
[01:02:40.328 --> 01:02:41.729]  They attack law enforcement.
[01:02:41.729 --> 01:02:43.189]  They attack first responders.
[01:02:43.189 --> 01:02:43.330]  Right?
[01:02:43.330 --> 01:02:48.532]  And that goes right back, by the way, to this whole issue with George Floyd and the new Candace Owens documentary.
[01:02:49.266 --> 01:02:56.391]  Well, they point out, you know, this guy had enough fentanyl and methamphetamine cocktail in him to kill pretty much anybody, even a guy as big as he was.
[01:02:56.391 --> 01:02:58.172]  George Floyd was six foot four, okay?
[01:02:58.172 --> 01:03:08.419]  He did have heart problems, by the way, and the medical examiner admitted on the stand, well, if we'd found him in his home with these levels in him, then yes, we would have given that and considered that a
[01:03:09.861 --> 01:03:10.742]  Overdose.
[01:03:10.742 --> 01:03:12.183]  But what did we see?
[01:03:12.183 --> 01:03:17.167]  We saw the targeting of our police officers, one of the bedrocks of our society.
[01:03:17.167 --> 01:03:23.692]  One of the institutions, and by the way, don't get me wrong, you know, I'm the first person to come out here and talk about bad cops and we have issues with cops.
[01:03:23.692 --> 01:03:26.674]  Sure, but they're attacking those institutions to bully them and take them over.
[01:03:27.617 --> 01:03:27.817]  Right.
[01:03:27.817 --> 01:03:29.418]  They want to take over these institutions.
[01:03:29.418 --> 01:03:31.479]  And by the way, Al Sharpton mentioned this once.
[01:03:31.479 --> 01:03:34.040]  Al Sharpton mentioned the reason they do this.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.060]  You can see the examiner's report.
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:36.481]  It's right up on HennepinCounty.com.
[01:03:36.481 --> 01:03:37.221]  You can go look at it.
[01:03:37.221 --> 01:03:38.342]  I just pulled it there yesterday.
[01:03:38.342 --> 01:03:40.383]  I put some red circles on it so everyone could see.
[01:03:41.334 --> 01:03:43.216]  This has been on their website the entire time.
[01:03:43.216 --> 01:03:45.978]  No life-threatening injuries, but we did find what?
[01:03:45.978 --> 01:03:48.760]  Fentanyl, norefentanyl, methamphetamines.
[01:03:48.760 --> 01:03:51.462]  They want to nationalize the police force.
[01:03:51.462 --> 01:03:52.823]  This was Obama's plan.
[01:03:52.823 --> 01:03:59.408]  This was the original plan going all the way back to the start of Black Lives Matter in 2013 and 2014, okay?
[01:03:59.408 --> 01:04:02.311]  Ferguson with Zimmerman and everything that we saw.
[01:04:03.817 --> 01:04:15.161]  They've wanted to take out this police force because they don't want your municipality to have its own police force and they really don't want sheriff's departments to be out there because the sheriff obviously is a constitutionally elected office.
[01:04:15.161 --> 01:04:16.601]  They don't want any of that going on.
[01:04:16.601 --> 01:04:19.802]  They want the federal government to achieve this so they have total control.
[01:04:19.802 --> 01:04:24.363]  So I want you to understand the predictive programming that you're looking at here when you see these situations.
[01:04:24.363 --> 01:04:30.605]  When you look, by the way, and they'll only ever show you one angle of Derek Chauvin's knee on the neck.
[01:04:30.605 --> 01:04:31.986]  They show you the angle from
[01:04:32.506 --> 01:04:33.427]  I am extremely honored.
[01:05:02.756 --> 01:05:04.260]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[01:05:10.435 --> 01:05:15.356]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[01:05:15.356 --> 01:05:18.877]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[01:05:18.877 --> 01:05:19.737]  It's game over.
[01:05:19.737 --> 01:05:25.438]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[01:05:25.438 --> 01:05:30.019]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[01:05:30.019 --> 01:05:36.181]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[01:05:36.661 --> 01:05:48.628]  And that's why when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[01:05:48.628 --> 01:05:54.751]  The fight starts at InfoWars.com and the support of the fight starts at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:56.572]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[01:06:01.121 --> 01:06:07.388]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:24.224]  Well, the great Jack Posobiec joins us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:24.224 --> 01:06:25.365]  TPUSA.com.
[01:06:25.365 --> 01:06:26.466]  You can find him everywhere.
[01:06:26.466 --> 01:06:29.268]  These have Jack Posobiec introduced to them.
[01:06:29.268 --> 01:06:34.713]  I get really excited to see the amazing work he's done in the last seven, eight years that I've known him.
[01:06:34.713 --> 01:06:35.394]  Jack Posobiec.
[01:06:36.838 --> 01:06:39.561]  Obviously there's a battle, not just for America, but the world.
[01:06:39.561 --> 01:06:40.903]  A fourth turning happening right now.
[01:06:40.903 --> 01:06:42.124]  We were talking in the break.
[01:06:42.124 --> 01:06:43.526]  I said, what's front and center for you?
[01:06:43.526 --> 01:06:47.010]  And you said, the normalization of nuclear war.
[01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:53.137]  Niels deGrasse Tyson, Sean Penn, not just him, government agencies, mainstream media.
[01:06:53.137 --> 01:06:54.759]  Oh, nuclear war is good for the environment.
[01:06:54.759 --> 01:06:55.680]  It'll lower the temperature.
[01:06:57.142 --> 01:06:58.803]  Hydrogen bombs aren't radioactive.
[01:06:58.803 --> 01:07:00.044]  Yeah, they are.
[01:07:00.044 --> 01:07:03.367]  And plus, they make nuclear reactors that are giant dirty bombs go off.
[01:07:03.367 --> 01:07:04.688]  What is behind that?
[01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:08.532]  Because you were in Naval Intelligence, but that, you know, a lot of folks have been in intelligence groups.
[01:07:08.532 --> 01:07:11.414]  You're proven you're really smart, can predict the future.
[01:07:11.414 --> 01:07:15.397]  What do you make of the Ukraine war, this normalization of nukes, and how big an issue this is?
[01:07:15.397 --> 01:07:18.380]  The Nord Stream being blown up, the bridge being blown up.
[01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:19.401]  Where do you see all this going?
[01:07:21.104 --> 01:07:32.952]  Well, Alex, when I look at these articles just flying across the news desk every day, the same way that when I'm doing my show prep, the same way that you do show prep, you're just seeing what's coming across the news.
[01:07:32.952 --> 01:07:42.758]  And all of a sudden, you're getting all of these articles, literally dozens, maybe hundreds at this point of articles every day talking about, here's what would happen if a nuclear weapon hit New York City.
[01:07:42.758 --> 01:07:46.941]  Here's what would happen if one hit Washington, D.C., where I live with my wife and children.
[01:07:46.941 --> 01:07:47.562]  Here's what happened.
[01:07:47.562 --> 01:07:48.702]  We all live right downtown, by the way.
[01:07:48.702 --> 01:07:51.084]  I don't want to keep them that close to the politicians.
[01:07:53.745 --> 01:07:57.447]  What we're seeing here is a very dangerous normalization.
[01:07:57.447 --> 01:08:02.509]  This idea that, well, it's just a couple of nuclear weapons, because we all understand, we've forgotten something.
[01:08:02.509 --> 01:08:05.210]  And I actually think that our elites have forgotten something over the years.
[01:08:05.210 --> 01:08:11.753]  It's like, you know, they go to skull and bones, they go into these institutions, they go into these secret societies, right?
[01:08:11.753 --> 01:08:14.114]  The mystery, you know, mystery cults and everything like this.
[01:08:14.114 --> 01:08:18.196]  But the problem is, it's like they, they've got, spent all their time
[01:08:18.948 --> 01:08:21.510]  They spend all their time focusing on just being corrupt.
[01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:23.531]  They don't actually run the system anymore.
[01:08:23.531 --> 01:08:24.532]  So they don't run the system.
[01:08:24.532 --> 01:08:25.972]  So that's why our infrastructure is falling apart.
[01:08:25.972 --> 01:08:27.633]  That's why our energy grid is falling apart.
[01:08:27.633 --> 01:08:28.914]  That's why buildings just fall down.
[01:08:28.914 --> 01:08:33.937]  You know, we don't, you know, the Kerch Bridge was attacked by a truck bomb in Crimea.
[01:08:33.937 --> 01:08:35.358]  That's how it was blown up.
[01:08:35.358 --> 01:08:37.720]  We know, obviously, that Nord Stream 2 was blown up.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:39.040]  Nord Stream 1 is also blown up.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.361]  We don't know who did it yet.
[01:08:40.361 --> 01:08:44.244]  I think it's kind of silly to think that the Russians would blow up their own pipeline in a time of war.
[01:08:45.444 --> 01:08:46.985]  I must have missed that chapter.
[01:08:46.985 --> 01:08:49.747]  Yeah, they wouldn't blow up their own leverage over Europe.
[01:08:49.747 --> 01:08:53.489]  No, no, their leverage over Europe is sitting at the bottom of the Baltic Sea right now.
[01:08:53.489 --> 01:09:00.974]  But what I'm also seeing are these articles talking about, oh, it's, you know, tactical nukes, it's perfectly fine to see them, it might not be as bad.
[01:09:00.974 --> 01:09:02.855]  They've actually forgotten, Alex.
[01:09:02.855 --> 01:09:06.898]  They've actually forgotten the importance of the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[01:09:06.898 --> 01:09:12.581]  They've forgotten everything that we've learned through the nuclear era, and the fact that we didn't see nuclear weapons.
[01:09:12.581 --> 01:09:13.782]  Because there's an interesting
[01:09:14.665 --> 01:09:15.066]  I don't
[01:09:30.642 --> 01:09:31.082]  We're good to go.
[01:09:48.373 --> 01:09:50.655]  I mean, what it would look like is eventually you'd get to the point where
[01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:09.761]  Imagine attaching this to one of these hypersonic glide vehicles.
[01:10:09.761 --> 01:10:12.845]  Imagine that we can't shoot down that they can't shoot down.
[01:10:12.845 --> 01:10:17.551]  Imagine attaching these to the space planes in the secret space program that we have.
[01:10:17.551 --> 01:10:22.018]  You would get to the point where we've got unstoppable nuclear missiles on both sides.
[01:10:22.458 --> 01:10:29.782]  What that does, it creates a situation where, you know, we've always referred to it by the acronym of MAD, Mutually Assured Destruction.
[01:10:29.782 --> 01:10:41.567]  It would lead us to the point that, even if, by the way, if it's just rogue elements of the military, because that's all that's left, but if you've got one submarine that's got nuclear ballistic missiles on that thing, that cannot be stopped, right?
[01:10:41.567 --> 01:10:43.448]  And that's the key, cannot be stopped.
[01:10:43.448 --> 01:10:49.331]  Whether we've got them, the North Koreans have got them, the Chinese have got them, all right, Israel's got, you know, it's, you know, obviously it's, you know, it's classified, but
[01:10:50.231 --> 01:10:52.953]  Israel does and has maintained a program over the years.
[01:10:52.953 --> 01:10:57.175]  Iran, more than likely, has a few at this point and they keep telling us, they keep jerking our chains.
[01:10:57.175 --> 01:10:58.556]  And what you're saying is very astute.
[01:10:58.556 --> 01:11:01.578]  Most of the war games show that if the U.S.
[01:11:01.578 --> 01:11:06.341]  and Russia get into war, even limited, suddenly Pakistan and India go to war.
[01:11:06.341 --> 01:11:10.143]  India and China, which most analysts think is actually the main threat.
[01:11:10.143 --> 01:11:12.004]  Once you let Pandora out, it's over.
[01:11:13.593 --> 01:11:42.517]  It's completely over and that's why if you notice very carefully one of the things that Russia has to do with this new coalition that they're forming is a balancing act between India and China because while as Russia obviously is backstopped by both, maintains relations with both, what Russia has to do though is maintain these open relations but at the same time India and China hate each other and everybody knows that the only land army in all of the world that could stand up
[01:11:42.817 --> 01:11:46.640]  To the People's Liberation Army, the PRC, would be India.
[01:11:46.640 --> 01:11:53.366]  That's why the Chinese focus so much on maintaining total control over Southeast Asia, over Burma, focusing on Laos, etc, etc.
[01:11:53.366 --> 01:11:55.048]  But Vietnam, of course, hates China.
[01:11:55.048 --> 01:11:57.850]  So you've got these huge issues that are going on.
[01:11:57.850 --> 01:12:00.412]  And let's walk through that in Kashmir.
[01:12:00.412 --> 01:12:09.140]  The Indians just defeated a Chinese proxy army, so the real first battle of World War III isn't just happening in Ukraine, it's really happening in Kashmir.
[01:12:10.365 --> 01:12:16.635]  Right, the problem is, so here's the way it looks, just to get out of the nitty gritty of it, the way it looks is this.
[01:12:16.635 --> 01:12:23.526]  Do we want these to stay at the level of regional conflicts or do we want these, think of a history book that's written 50 years from now.
[01:12:24.218 --> 01:12:48.320]  Do we want this to be Chapter 1, the prologue of World War 3, or do we want these to maintain their status as regional conflicts, India-China, Russia-Ukraine, maintain it as a regional conflict that's contained under containment theory, which used to be something that our elites would use, or do we want it to spill over into a full-on world conflict?
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:49.521]  And there's that great quote out there,
[01:12:50.282 --> 01:12:57.747]  If World War 3 is fought with nuclear weapons, then World War 4 will be fought with sticks and stones, because that's all the survivors will have left.
[01:13:20.482 --> 01:13:36.235]  Well, I think we're dealing with a new set of elites, one that we haven't really seen yet so far in American or Western history, because you see people who are so completely disconnected from their own countries, they view themselves as global citizens.
[01:13:36.235 --> 01:13:42.019]  You heard Barack Obama say that multiple times, that he viewed himself as a citizen of the planet, a citizen of the earth.
[01:13:42.019 --> 01:13:47.984]  And what they really mean, Alex, is that for them, they don't care about what happens to the rest of us, the hoi polloi that's living in the cities.
[01:13:47.984 --> 01:13:49.105]  We're just insects to them.
[01:13:50.126 --> 01:13:51.226]  They want Elysium.
[01:13:51.226 --> 01:13:52.067]  They want their yachts.
[01:13:52.067 --> 01:13:53.768]  Jeff Bezos has his starships.
[01:13:53.768 --> 01:13:55.970]  They'll be perfectly fine in any of these scenarios.
[01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:57.851]  They've already got their bug-out shelters.
[01:13:57.851 --> 01:13:59.593]  They've already got their seed bunkers.
[01:13:59.593 --> 01:14:01.674]  They've already got all their places, their secret islands.
[01:14:01.674 --> 01:14:02.034]  That's right!
[01:14:02.034 --> 01:14:12.342]  They've already sold themselves on the idea that a nuclear war is survivable from them, when every equation shows total breakdown of society, nuclear reactors melting down everywhere.
[01:14:12.342 --> 01:14:13.143]  They're crazy!
[01:14:13.143 --> 01:14:16.225]  One of the questions that I've seen in one of these high-level discussions
[01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:17.165]  Yeah, I think so.
[01:14:41.636 --> 01:14:42.698]  For a collapse.
[01:14:42.698 --> 01:14:44.561]  They already see a collapse coming.
[01:14:44.561 --> 01:14:45.823]  And they're planning ahead for it.
[01:14:45.823 --> 01:14:47.044]  5 years ahead, 10 years ahead, 20 years ahead.
[01:14:48.428 --> 01:14:50.209]  They understand what's coming on.
[01:14:50.209 --> 01:14:52.570]  They don't care what happens to the rest of us, Alex.
[01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:57.832]  They only care about themselves, their own interests, and them being able to continue on.
[01:14:57.832 --> 01:15:08.076]  That's why, by the way, at the same time, they're so focused on transhumanism, and I love that they've got Joe Allen up in Pennsylvania covering John Fetterman as the world's first cyborg candidate.
[01:15:08.076 --> 01:15:12.038]  Because, by the way, you know they're talking about letting Fetterman use the computer during the debate.
[01:15:12.038 --> 01:15:14.339]  You know they're saying that, because my question with that thing is,
[01:15:15.540 --> 01:15:20.364]  Is that thing just giving him the questions, or is it giving him pre-prompted answers as well?
[01:15:20.364 --> 01:15:26.510]  So is it giving him the answers to respond to, and at that point you have to question yourself, at what point does he end and the machine begin?
[01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:37.280]  So the ultimate apotheosis that our current elites, our corrupt elites, are trying to achieve is full-on immortality through mind-machine merger.
[01:15:37.280 --> 01:15:39.282]  And John Fetterman, he's just a prototype of this.
[01:15:40.393 --> 01:15:41.114]  Deep stuff.
[01:15:41.114 --> 01:15:42.395]  Jack Masovic, final segment.
[01:15:42.395 --> 01:15:43.996]  You're absolutely right.
[01:15:43.996 --> 01:15:48.420]  They are trying to secure their future while destroying ours.
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:52.063]  Securing their future would be securing our collective future.
[01:15:52.063 --> 01:15:58.749]  Any aristocrat knows their power is through empowering the people of the Red Act.
[01:15:58.749 --> 01:16:04.353]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[01:16:05.512 --> 01:16:18.661]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:33.371]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout so you get an additional 10% off.

[01:16:38.019 --> 01:16:41.462]  They admit, once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[01:16:41.462 --> 01:16:44.244]  I'm in your hands, and I'm asking for your support now.
[01:16:44.244 --> 01:16:48.547]  You have my commitment to never give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.

[01:17:29.597 --> 01:17:29.917]  I think so.
[01:17:59.276 --> 01:18:10.601]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[01:18:10.601 --> 01:18:12.482]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[01:18:12.482 --> 01:18:13.942]  That's what they want to take away.
[01:18:13.942 --> 01:18:15.483]  Your ability to speak freely.
[01:18:15.483 --> 01:18:17.164]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[01:18:17.164 --> 01:18:18.444]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[01:18:18.444 --> 01:18:19.845]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[01:18:20.265 --> 01:18:25.110]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[01:18:25.110 --> 01:18:27.492]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[01:18:27.492 --> 01:18:29.534]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[01:18:29.534 --> 01:18:36.481]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet about East America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalists' agenda.
[01:18:37.102 --> 01:18:42.486]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[01:18:42.486 --> 01:18:51.433]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsTore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[01:18:51.433 --> 01:18:57.718]  1776 is the promo code, the destination is InfoWarsTore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[01:18:59.138 --> 01:19:11.891]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[01:19:11.891 --> 01:19:14.333]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[01:19:15.094 --> 01:19:24.005]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live, and people don't listen, and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[01:19:24.005 --> 01:19:25.987]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[01:19:25.987 --> 01:19:27.509]  I don't plan to miss your health.
[01:19:27.509 --> 01:19:35.138]  But if I wasn't taking products like X3 from mFootwearShort.com, I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[01:19:35.638 --> 01:19:40.259]  The energy, the stamina, the libido, the immune system boost is incredible.

[01:19:47.001 --> 01:19:49.662]  There's a run on iodine happening right now because of the war.
[01:19:49.662 --> 01:19:50.923]  We're not selling it for that.
[01:19:50.923 --> 01:19:54.364]  We're selling it for what it does for your immune system and your focus and clarity.

[01:20:04.831 --> 01:20:10.455]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:10.455 --> 01:20:20.142]  Well, what Jack Posobiec has been laying out is absolutely the most critical information.
[01:20:20.142 --> 01:20:23.184]  Period.
[01:20:23.184 --> 01:20:27.507]  In the globalists that have robbed and controlled society, consolidate power, they live in a post-human world.
[01:20:29.130 --> 01:20:39.874]  Have now set in motion something that makes them have to run to armored redoubts in the middle of very, very obscure, faraway places.
[01:20:39.874 --> 01:20:41.054]  They've really destroyed themselves.
[01:20:41.054 --> 01:20:47.557]  They've been delusional in their greed, not building a powerful, successful world that creates security for all.
[01:20:48.615 --> 01:20:56.778]  They're different from past elites, because anybody that knows rich people and knows their children, knows that their children are horrible spoiled brats and their kids are like psychotics.
[01:20:56.778 --> 01:21:11.304]  That's why any smart elites, whether it was British royalty, you name it, would send their young children to boarding schools where they got beat up and attacked and basically made to be tough, or you'd have a worthless blob.
[01:21:12.247 --> 01:21:17.389]  Well, the last generation or so didn't do that with the elite families, and I'm not saying that's a good thing, they do their own kids.
[01:21:17.389 --> 01:21:34.115]  Kind of a trauma-based mind control, but they've created totally disconnected individuals who run technocracies, who just want power and control and have all these sycophants beneath them that are yes-men, and the new world order, global government, transhumanist project is going to destroy the planet.
[01:21:34.807 --> 01:21:35.887]  It should be abandoned.
[01:21:35.887 --> 01:21:36.948]  It should be rejected.
[01:21:36.948 --> 01:21:42.309]  The gain of function, preparing all these deadly viruses, it should be rejected.
[01:21:42.309 --> 01:21:47.110]  We should collectively decide to not do it, but we're already pretty far down the path here.
[01:21:47.110 --> 01:21:48.651]  So, we've got about eight minutes left.
[01:21:48.651 --> 01:21:50.591]  Jack Posobiec, knocking it out of the park.
[01:21:50.591 --> 01:21:52.292]  tpusa.com.
[01:21:52.292 --> 01:21:54.572]  And of course, you do your great human event shows as well.
[01:21:54.572 --> 01:21:55.992]  It'll be premiering Sunday.
[01:21:55.992 --> 01:21:56.793]  I was on with you for an hour.
[01:21:56.793 --> 01:21:57.873]  It was great to be with you.
[01:21:57.873 --> 01:22:00.134]  In closing, I'm not going to interrupt for the next seven minutes.
[01:22:00.134 --> 01:22:01.474]  What do you want to finally impart to folks?
[01:22:03.066 --> 01:22:12.234]  Well, Alex, I would always want to impart to folks, and it's similar, you know, you and I go deep on this on the Sunday special at Human Events.
[01:22:12.234 --> 01:22:14.235]  You'll be able to see it at humanevents.com.
[01:22:14.235 --> 01:22:21.942]  You'll be able to see it Sunday morning, Human Events Daily, and then in the evening it's going to air, Real America's Voice, but Alex and I go deep on the question of God.
[01:22:22.651 --> 01:22:22.871]  I think?
[01:22:42.421 --> 01:22:45.783]  Then yes, you should obviously be the one who's at the head of it.
[01:22:45.783 --> 01:22:47.303]  I'm for all of those things.
[01:22:47.303 --> 01:22:50.545]  I want Michelangelo to be the one who's doing the sculpting.
[01:22:50.545 --> 01:22:56.647]  I don't want someone to come up and say, oh, Michelangelo can't do it because his team doesn't have the right diversity quotient or something like that.
[01:22:56.647 --> 01:22:57.488]  That's ridiculous.
[01:22:57.488 --> 01:22:58.528]  That's what's killing us.
[01:22:58.528 --> 01:23:00.349]  By the way, to turn that into something more realistic...
[01:23:00.829 --> 01:23:17.525]  I want to live in a society where our pilots are, you know, if I'm getting behind the seat of an airplane, my children are getting on an airplane, I want to know that my pilot is the best one that we could possibly find in the world, not just somebody who was able to pass through whatever woke filter they put on the entire process.
[01:23:18.507 --> 01:23:21.989]  This was the world that God designed for us.
[01:23:21.989 --> 01:23:28.654]  But what our corrupt elites are now doing is they are attempting to replace God with ourselves.
[01:23:28.654 --> 01:23:31.596]  They were trying to replace God with their own pagan cults.
[01:23:31.596 --> 01:23:35.419]  You see this, by the way, with these alphabet cults.
[01:23:35.419 --> 01:23:36.940]  You see it with the climate cults.
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:39.801]  You see it with so many other pagan forms of worship.
[01:23:39.801 --> 01:23:46.466]  You know, Media Matters attacked me last week for calling the worship of Gaia a pagan cult, when it obviously is a pagan cult.
[01:23:46.466 --> 01:23:47.447]  Give up Pachamama, etc.
[01:23:48.027 --> 01:24:01.131]  But also, the very next day, they went and started to desecrate one of the greatest paintings of all time by Vincent van Gogh, and they went and attacked this thing and said, our cult and our beliefs are more powerful than yours.
[01:24:01.131 --> 01:24:02.192]  And what is that?
[01:24:02.192 --> 01:24:04.312]  And here's something very interesting about that situation.
[01:24:04.312 --> 01:24:08.854]  We can laugh about them, and we can point out and make fun of them and say, oh, look at these crazy kids.
[01:24:08.854 --> 01:24:10.815]  But you know what they have?
[01:24:10.815 --> 01:24:13.155]  They have something that's very powerful.
[01:24:13.155 --> 01:24:14.196]  And we need to understand this.
[01:24:14.196 --> 01:24:15.176]  They have moral clarity.
[01:24:16.098 --> 01:24:19.419]  They have moral clarity behind their actions.
[01:24:19.419 --> 01:24:21.799]  They have moral clarity behind their words.
[01:24:21.799 --> 01:24:27.060]  They have moral clarity of tasks matched with purpose.
[01:24:27.060 --> 01:24:30.241]  Do we have that in Western societies today?
[01:24:30.241 --> 01:24:31.681]  Where is our moral clarity?
[01:24:31.681 --> 01:24:33.261]  Where is our moral center?
[01:24:33.261 --> 01:24:36.942]  Well, it used to come from the words of the Holy Bible.
[01:24:36.942 --> 01:24:39.062]  The Old Testament, the New Testament.
[01:24:39.062 --> 01:24:40.843]  I just took the family, we went on a trip.
[01:24:40.843 --> 01:24:41.743]  It was a turning point trip.
[01:24:42.518 --> 01:24:42.838]  We're good
[01:25:12.919 --> 01:25:28.378]  But also understanding that when you go to the place where God touched down on our world and in our world, met with the Virgin Mary, when we went to the Rock of Golgotha and put your own hand on it, when you stand next and put your hand on the Stone of Unction,
[01:25:29.031 --> 01:25:29.531]  We're good to go.
[01:25:47.913 --> 01:25:49.714]  That they don't talk about this very much.
[01:25:49.714 --> 01:25:54.978]  You know, our Constitution isn't set up to necessarily be a moral judgment.
[01:25:54.978 --> 01:25:57.940]  There's no moral code in our Constitution because they didn't need one.
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:25:59.902]  They didn't need one at the time of the founding.
[01:25:59.902 --> 01:26:05.586]  And there's also a reason, by the way, that the Bible doesn't talk about atheists, because there were no atheists at the time of the Bible.
[01:26:05.586 --> 01:26:06.547]  Everyone believed in something.
[01:26:06.547 --> 01:26:11.490]  You believed in one pagan cult, or you believed in another pagan cult, or you were Jewish and you believed in the one true God.
[01:26:12.811 --> 01:26:31.316]  The situation that we find ourselves in, again, is that we see pagan cults everywhere, we see pagan worship everywhere, we've got Halloween coming up, we've seen the perversion of what's supposed to be the night of the eve, the vigil for all saints day, the vigil of all hallows, and they've perverted it into be a dark, occult practice, right?
[01:26:31.316 --> 01:26:32.437]  Don't practice that.
[01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:33.237]  Worship the saints.
[01:26:33.237 --> 01:26:35.238]  Worship, or no, excuse me, don't worship the saints.
[01:26:35.238 --> 01:26:36.418]  Celebrate the saints.
[01:26:36.418 --> 01:26:37.558]  Worship God.
[01:26:37.558 --> 01:26:39.959]  We need to come back to a situation
[01:26:40.771 --> 01:26:51.845]  We need to come back to a situation where we have that moral core and that moral clarity as a country, because then we can then start imparting that into our institutions as we retake them.
[01:26:51.845 --> 01:26:56.711]  And as Marcuse laid out for us, it must be a long re-march.
[01:26:57.392 --> 01:26:57.572]  I think?
[01:27:18.470 --> 01:27:19.392]  The promised land.
[01:27:19.392 --> 01:27:25.142]  But I do need to understand, the people need to understand this, and Alex, you and I get into this in the special, that that doesn't mean there will not be challenges.
[01:27:25.142 --> 01:27:26.865]  That does not mean your faith will not be tested.
[01:27:26.865 --> 01:27:29.650]  That does not mean that you will not be tested.
[01:27:29.650 --> 01:27:31.413]  But you must look to God.
[01:27:32.432 --> 01:27:34.355]  And say, thank you, Lord.
[01:27:34.355 --> 01:27:37.478]  Thank you for this blessing of this challenge.
[01:27:37.478 --> 01:27:46.450]  Thank you for the blessing of this contest, this animating contest for freedom, for liberty, for our families, and for our future that you have given us.
[01:27:46.450 --> 01:27:48.312]  Because you have given us this cross to bear.
[01:27:48.312 --> 01:27:49.153]  You.
[01:27:49.153 --> 01:27:51.476]  And the question for us is, are we going to shoulder it?
[01:27:52.139 --> 01:28:01.143]  Are we going to shoulder it or are we going to accept, are we going to accept our lives be transformed and what they're trying to accomplish for us and accept their agendas?
[01:28:01.143 --> 01:28:01.763]  I won't.
[01:28:01.763 --> 01:28:02.503]  I'll tell you right now.
[01:28:02.503 --> 01:28:04.544]  I'm not going to, I'm going to completely reject it.
[01:28:04.544 --> 01:28:05.324]  I'm unvaccinated.
[01:28:05.324 --> 01:28:06.505]  My family's unvaccinated.
[01:28:06.505 --> 01:28:07.525]  My children are unvaccinated.
[01:28:07.525 --> 01:28:08.306]  We've got natural immunity.
[01:28:08.306 --> 01:28:09.326]  We're perfectly fine.
[01:28:09.326 --> 01:28:11.907]  We are not going to live with their agenda.
[01:28:11.907 --> 01:28:13.288]  Not now, not ever.
[01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:13.788]  Well, that's right.
[01:28:13.788 --> 01:28:16.569]  They say that we weren't a Christian nation, but the founders, George Washington,
[01:28:17.338 --> 01:28:19.259]  Thank you so much and have a great week.
[01:28:19.259 --> 01:28:20.380]  Come up with your family.
[01:28:43.786 --> 01:28:44.406]  Alex, you as well.
[01:28:44.406 --> 01:28:45.726]  We're praying for you, Alex.
[01:28:45.726 --> 01:28:46.867]  Thank you, brother.
[01:28:46.867 --> 01:28:48.207]  All right, Jack Posobiec.
[01:28:48.207 --> 01:28:49.467]  Amazing interview.
[01:28:49.467 --> 01:28:52.788]  I'm going to come back with the latest breaking news and more straight ahead.
[01:28:52.788 --> 01:28:54.068]  Infowars.com.
[01:28:54.068 --> 01:28:58.549]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:28:58.549 --> 01:29:04.610]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[01:29:04.610 --> 01:29:07.711]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore
[01:29:08.797 --> 01:29:13.720]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[01:29:13.720 --> 01:29:17.262]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[01:29:17.262 --> 01:29:18.102]  It's game over.
[01:29:18.102 --> 01:29:23.806]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[01:29:23.806 --> 01:29:28.408]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.

[01:31:42.335 --> 01:31:44.376]  It takes about two weeks to kick in.
[01:31:44.376 --> 01:31:46.337]  An aspirin kicks in in 30 minutes.
[01:31:46.337 --> 01:31:47.937]  Tylenol kicks in in 30 minutes.
[01:31:47.937 --> 01:31:50.639]  This kicks in in about two weeks on average.
[01:31:50.639 --> 01:31:52.439]  You need to experience it.

[01:32:05.012 --> 01:32:08.894]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[01:32:08.894 --> 01:32:18.237]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[01:32:18.237 --> 01:32:23.899]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[01:32:23.899 --> 01:32:27.500]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[01:32:28.340 --> 01:32:31.443]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[01:32:31.443 --> 01:32:37.728]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[01:32:37.728 --> 01:32:39.029]  It's unsustainable.
[01:32:39.029 --> 01:32:40.251]  So please, visit.

[01:33:00.156 --> 01:33:06.059]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:10.335 --> 01:33:13.148]  I'm sick and tired of living in my own world
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:54.441]  I want the American way.
[01:33:54.441 --> 01:34:00.766]  You better get out of the way, you Satan.
[01:34:00.766 --> 01:34:11.895]  We reject you and your father, the devil.
[01:34:11.895 --> 01:34:14.737]  Freedom isn't free, folks.
[01:34:14.737 --> 01:34:16.198]  Our ancestors put down the down payment.
[01:34:16.198 --> 01:34:18.420]  Now we're gonna pay the rest of the bill.
[01:34:25.029 --> 01:34:40.041]  Nobody rides for free.
[01:34:40.041 --> 01:34:46.166]  So much news to cover.
[01:34:46.166 --> 01:34:51.290]  But the first thing Jack Lesovic said 45 minutes ago when he first joined us was
[01:34:53.700 --> 01:34:59.824]  We need to stop the censorship because if they can censor us and get us to silence ourselves, because that's the trick.
[01:34:59.824 --> 01:35:00.585]  You think you're censored.
[01:35:00.585 --> 01:35:01.205]  You're not.
[01:35:01.205 --> 01:35:02.306]  Don't let them silence you.
[01:35:02.306 --> 01:35:02.846]  You're smart.
[01:35:02.846 --> 01:35:05.468]  You've got ways to get around it.
[01:35:05.468 --> 01:35:08.630]  If they can silence us, they win.
[01:35:08.630 --> 01:35:16.115]  So I want to go back to the news and the military news and the economic news and the news I haven't hit yet here in a moment.
[01:35:16.115 --> 01:35:22.980]  But here on this Wednesday, October 19th broadcast, we have to talk about Kanye West or yay.
[01:35:28.103 --> 01:35:32.326]  He comes out, he criticizes the system, those that are censoring him.
[01:35:32.326 --> 01:35:35.549]  They take his bank accounts away, they take his concerts away.
[01:35:35.549 --> 01:35:39.913]  And he gave a speech, I guess yesterday afternoon, that I just saw this morning.
[01:35:39.913 --> 01:35:42.294]  Play it in a moment.
[01:35:42.294 --> 01:35:44.136]  Where he said, look, I'm called by God to do this.
[01:35:44.136 --> 01:35:44.616]  And he's 100% real.
[01:35:44.616 --> 01:35:49.080]  People go, oh, well, he used to be part of the system and did masonic, this and that.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:50.901]  It doesn't matter.
[01:35:50.901 --> 01:35:53.584]  Most of Jesus' followers were sinners.
[01:35:53.584 --> 01:35:55.325]  They were all sinners, but really bad sinners.
[01:35:55.325 --> 01:35:56.326]  They repented.
[01:35:56.326 --> 01:35:57.246]  This modern
[01:35:58.522 --> 01:35:58.903]  I don't know.
[01:35:58.903 --> 01:35:59.443]  I don't know.
[01:36:18.786 --> 01:36:20.767]  He's another domino to fall.
[01:36:20.767 --> 01:36:32.334]  And I said this a week ago, I said, they've had this show trial, they've had this fake ruling on me, now the Democrat party control lawyers are going to sue Tucker Carlson, Kanye West, I didn't know who.
[01:36:32.334 --> 01:36:48.244]  And now the Democrat connected lawyer, big Black Lives Matter guy, George Floyd's relation, I guess mother of their child,
[01:36:49.670 --> 01:36:53.232]  Wants 200 plus million dollars because Kanye ran out of a coroner's report.
[01:36:53.232 --> 01:36:57.635]  He had no physical injuries and it looked like it was probably fentanyl and methamphetamine killed him.
[01:36:57.635 --> 01:37:08.022]  We're not allowed to say that because he's now a saint in anti-white division in this country to break this country up.
[01:37:08.022 --> 01:37:14.726]  So here's a clip of the lawyer.
[01:37:16.772 --> 01:37:25.375]  Floyd's family lawyer, and he said he planned to, they've now filed it, a $250 million lawsuit, and they bring up Alex Jones.
[01:37:25.375 --> 01:37:26.275]  Here it is.
[01:37:26.275 --> 01:37:28.816]  Let me ask you about this legal action.
[01:37:28.816 --> 01:37:36.278]  I wonder if this will mean that Kanye West's comments about George Floyd will gain even more attention.
[01:37:36.278 --> 01:37:39.839]  Does that factor into the decision to move forward with this lawsuit?
[01:37:41.479 --> 01:37:43.660]  Well, we're going to move forward.
[01:37:43.660 --> 01:37:50.443]  And whether or not it receives more attention, we think it's a very important issue in this country.
[01:37:50.443 --> 01:37:55.345]  I mean, people are talking about free speech, but people also need to understand the limitations.
[01:37:55.345 --> 01:38:09.071]  If you're going to use other people's name for profit, if you're going to profit from other people's pain, if you're going to re-traumatize people, then you have to pay for it just like Alex Jones paid for it in the verdict against him for nearly a billion dollars.
[01:38:11.286 --> 01:38:19.152]  So that's the unfair trade practices claim, where the judge found me guilty and then told the jury how guilty I was.
[01:38:19.152 --> 01:38:22.515]  They claim I questioned Sandy Hook because I made money off of it.
[01:38:22.515 --> 01:38:23.595]  Why'd I question every big event?
[01:38:23.595 --> 01:38:26.718]  A lot of them are staged, some are real.
[01:38:26.718 --> 01:38:30.281]  I questioned WMDs in Iraq, Jussie Smollett, I was right about those.
[01:38:30.281 --> 01:38:37.906]  But the point is, they're following that same new idea, and you know they're going to default.
[01:38:37.906 --> 01:38:39.307]  Kanye West, yay.
[01:38:40.407 --> 01:38:41.648]  You know, because they won't let him have a trial.
[01:38:41.648 --> 01:38:43.408]  I mean, he's a public figure.
[01:38:43.408 --> 01:38:45.549]  These people are public figures.
[01:38:45.549 --> 01:38:47.290]  The guy he supposedly defamed is dead.
[01:38:47.290 --> 01:38:48.871]  A dead person can't supposedly sue you.
[01:38:48.871 --> 01:38:52.492]  But they don't care what the law says.
[01:38:52.492 --> 01:39:00.956]  Remember Kanye West donated $2 million for George Floyd's six-year-old daughter's college fund.
[01:39:00.956 --> 01:39:08.639]  And now the very people that he supported, talking about biting the hand that feeds you, are suing him.
[01:39:10.253 --> 01:39:21.535]  And I guarantee you, when he's defaulted in front of a jury, the judge will say, you can't say you gave two million dollars to these people.
[01:39:21.535 --> 01:39:23.275]  See how it works?
[01:39:23.275 --> 01:39:24.955]  But hey, nobody's gonna shut up.
[01:39:24.955 --> 01:39:25.876]  Nobody's going away.
[01:39:25.876 --> 01:39:30.256]  This intimidation's meant, oh, they can get Kanye West, they can get Tucker Carlson, they can get Alex Jones.
[01:39:30.256 --> 01:39:31.597]  It's meant to scare off the Joe Rogans.
[01:39:31.597 --> 01:39:35.337]  It's meant to scare off the rest of the thinkers so the globalists can win.
[01:39:35.337 --> 01:39:36.657]  It's meant to scare Joe Rogan.
[01:39:36.657 --> 01:39:38.318]  This is all meant to scare Joe Rogan.
[01:39:38.318 --> 01:39:39.478]  And everybody like him.
[01:39:41.817 --> 01:39:42.357]  That's it.
[01:39:42.357 --> 01:39:42.777]  Period.
[01:39:42.777 --> 01:39:46.359]  We're right on the cusp of victory.
[01:39:46.359 --> 01:39:53.701]  So here's Kanye, coming out of an event, talking to a camera, yesterday.
[01:39:53.701 --> 01:39:55.482]  Here it is.
[01:39:55.482 --> 01:39:58.803]  Yeah, Noriega, I apologize for your George Floyd comments.
[01:39:58.803 --> 01:40:04.004]  How do you feel about them?
[01:40:04.004 --> 01:40:06.125]  I feel like... Hit pause and start it over.
[01:40:06.125 --> 01:40:07.446]  We're gonna have to come back and play this.
[01:40:07.446 --> 01:40:08.366]  It's like four minutes long, but...
[01:40:10.118 --> 01:40:12.841]  A show he's on apologizes for what he said.
[01:40:12.841 --> 01:40:15.003]  This is so pathetic.
[01:40:15.003 --> 01:40:20.287]  Go back to it.
[01:40:20.287 --> 01:40:29.595]  I feel like Black Lives Matter is like a warm water, it's a hot shower, and White Lives Matter is a closed shower.
[01:40:29.595 --> 01:40:32.698]  The funny thing about woke culture is like
[01:40:33.618 --> 01:40:35.879]  Woke culture is not really woke like that.
[01:40:35.879 --> 01:40:43.081]  A lot of times people, they would rather just exist inside of the pain of a lie than deal with the harsh realities of the truth.
[01:40:43.081 --> 01:40:52.243]  For us to look further, look at like JFK, how many documentaries there are on what happened there.
[01:40:52.243 --> 01:40:58.245]  Like as a people, we are a sophisticated people that
[01:40:59.656 --> 01:41:03.837]  I'm sorry I'm distracted by these people honking over here and stuff.
[01:41:28.382 --> 01:41:29.182]  We're good to go.
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:54.466]  Jewish people in media that are in power that tried to have, they bought the black voice, but they haven't been able to buy my voice.
[01:41:54.466 --> 01:41:56.227]  So instead they blackballed me.
[01:41:56.227 --> 01:41:59.030]  They threatened people to not interview me.
[01:41:59.030 --> 01:42:01.011]  They threatened people to get away from me.
[01:42:01.011 --> 01:42:03.193]  They closed down my stadiums.
[01:42:03.193 --> 01:42:04.314]  Love you too family.
[01:42:04.314 --> 01:42:04.694]  Love you too.
[01:42:06.278 --> 01:42:07.838]  You said thinking, right?
[01:42:07.838 --> 01:42:09.019]  Appreciate you.
[01:42:09.019 --> 01:42:16.120]  Yeah, they've done all this stuff for years, messing with me, just like poking at me, like calling me out my name.
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:17.260]  My name is Jay.
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:20.221]  Anytime they say Kanye West, I change my name.
[01:42:20.221 --> 01:42:21.941]  It's like Cassius Clay to Ali.
[01:42:21.941 --> 01:42:28.462]  You respect me as a man, as an American, that my name is Jay, that I have the right to choose what my name is.
[01:42:28.462 --> 01:42:30.543]  So when media does that, it's already disrespect.
[01:42:31.383 --> 01:42:32.384]  I love rappers.
[01:42:32.384 --> 01:42:33.725]  Rappers are artists.
[01:42:33.725 --> 01:42:44.314]  But when media calls me a rapper, it's specifically to not bring up the fact that I'm worth 11 billion dollars, that I'm the richest black man of all time, that I'm a billionaire, that I'm a tycoon, that I'm a visionary.
[01:42:44.314 --> 01:42:47.957]  And if I say that, if I say those three things, then they'll say I'm a narcissist.
[01:42:47.957 --> 01:42:48.358]  Right?
[01:42:48.358 --> 01:42:53.702]  But they push you down so much that you got to fight just to say who you are.
[01:42:53.702 --> 01:42:54.163]  That's right.
[01:42:54.163 --> 01:42:55.384]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:55.384 --> 01:42:55.724]  Stay with us.

[01:45:03.240 --> 01:45:12.822]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[01:45:12.822 --> 01:45:29.024]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[01:45:29.024 --> 01:45:31.925]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[01:45:32.845 --> 01:45:39.429]  Because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[01:45:39.429 --> 01:45:41.130]  I don't take the credit.

[01:47:04.846 --> 01:47:10.047]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:47:10.047 --> 01:47:12.248]  I asked Bobby Dylan.
[01:47:12.248 --> 01:47:14.369]  I didn't ask Alex Jones, did you?
[01:47:30.436 --> 01:47:34.379]  You won't get what you're after.
[01:47:34.379 --> 01:47:41.164]  I won't get to get what I'm after, till the day I die.
[01:47:41.164 --> 01:47:43.265]  You'll be born again.
[01:47:43.265 --> 01:47:46.467]  You'll get it all.
[01:47:46.467 --> 01:47:51.271]  People tend to hate me, cause I never smile.
[01:47:51.271 --> 01:47:54.573]  As I ransack their homes, they wanna shake my hand.
[01:47:57.288 --> 01:48:04.952]  Listen to this part right here.
[01:48:04.952 --> 01:48:22.002]  Kanye West said something.
[01:48:22.002 --> 01:48:25.724]  As he went to break.
[01:48:27.674 --> 01:48:32.115]  That is so incredibly important.
[01:48:32.115 --> 01:48:35.516]  Till the day I die.
[01:48:35.516 --> 01:48:42.718]  What'd he say?
[01:48:42.718 --> 01:48:48.840]  He said, I gotta fight just for people to know who I really am.
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:52.801]  Yeah, he's got tens of billions of dollars.
[01:48:52.801 --> 01:48:55.022]  Top music guy in the world, arguably.
[01:48:56.212 --> 01:49:03.417]  And all he's trying to do is say who he is, and the whole system comes out against him, because if they can silence him, they can silence you.
[01:49:03.417 --> 01:49:05.258]  And that's what is bad about censorship.
[01:49:05.258 --> 01:49:07.619]  You think, oh, you're just cut off, you can't talk.
[01:49:07.619 --> 01:49:09.220]  No.
[01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:12.062]  That's just the beginning.
[01:49:12.062 --> 01:49:19.246]  Then they can say anything they want about you, and you can't respond.
[01:49:19.246 --> 01:49:20.127]  He said, I have to fight.
[01:49:22.034 --> 01:49:23.295]  Tell people who I really am.
[01:49:23.295 --> 01:49:26.178]  He doesn't want his identity stolen.
[01:49:26.178 --> 01:49:32.765]  So as he's Kanye West, like Prince did, as owned by Hollywood, he says, I'm Ye.
[01:49:32.765 --> 01:49:46.378]  And all he wants you to do, and I get it, is recognize he's an independent person, not owned by Hollywood, getting rid of his slave name and bringing out his real name.
[01:49:47.591 --> 01:49:56.594]  I don't care if you're black or white or what color you are, under the new world order of the digital system and their program, you are a number, an expendable number.
[01:49:56.594 --> 01:50:00.436]  So this darling of Hollywood turns against him, and they don't know what to do.
[01:50:02.682 --> 01:50:07.283]  Meanwhile, Boston University created a bioweapon that kills 80% of humans.
[01:50:07.283 --> 01:50:08.964]  Totally illegal.
[01:50:08.964 --> 01:50:16.606]  And you don't see the ADL or Southern Poverty Law Center or CNN or all these ambulance-chasing lawyers that are suing Ye and Alex Jones.
[01:50:16.606 --> 01:50:18.147]  You don't hear a damn word out of them.
[01:50:18.147 --> 01:50:20.748]  Because they don't actually care about their own kids.
[01:50:20.748 --> 01:50:21.548]  They're delusional.
[01:50:21.548 --> 01:50:23.669]  But we do.
[01:50:23.669 --> 01:50:24.549]  Here's Ye.
[01:50:25.808 --> 01:50:26.789]  I love rappers.
[01:50:26.789 --> 01:50:28.149]  Rappers are artists.
[01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:38.715]  But when media calls me a rapper, specifically to not bring up the fact that I'm worth $11 billion, that I'm the richest black man of all time, that I'm a billionaire, that I'm a tycoon, that I'm a visionary.
[01:50:38.715 --> 01:50:42.376]  And if I say that, if I say those three things, then they'll say I'm a narcissist.
[01:50:42.376 --> 01:50:42.777]  Right?
[01:50:42.777 --> 01:50:48.359]  But they push you down so much that you got to fight just to say who you are.
[01:50:48.359 --> 01:50:48.640]  You know,
[01:50:50.180 --> 01:51:00.928]  What I got from the documentary, from the Candace Owens documentary, was I felt like it was a setup.
[01:51:00.928 --> 01:51:07.692]  I felt that in the documentary, if you look at it, he told his roommates, they want a tall guy like me.
[01:51:07.692 --> 01:51:09.133]  They want a tall guy like me.
[01:51:09.133 --> 01:51:10.314]  Well, who is they?
[01:51:10.314 --> 01:51:16.639]  I'm opposed to that as a question, as opposed to, you know, giving you some kind of theory that I can't pinpoint.
[01:51:19.688 --> 01:51:26.331]  And this idea, these martyrs that we have, it's 14 kids that's dying in Chicago every single day.
[01:51:26.331 --> 01:51:47.499]  And they have this Jewish media, black media, trauma culture, trauma economy, the stuff that Charlemagne Tha God works for, the stuff that Rosenberg works for, the stuff that academics, the guys, the academics, you gotta understand, all these people that y'all listening to out here, I'm gonna tell y'all, they're getting their checks cut.
[01:51:49.292 --> 01:51:53.456]  You know, and y'all, I need y'all to really respect what I'm doing.
[01:51:53.456 --> 01:51:59.561]  The stuff that I'm doing, I'm saying online and love the fact, look, I got, I got money.
[01:51:59.561 --> 01:52:01.462]  I got my songs.
[01:52:01.462 --> 01:52:04.705]  I could go off and just go to, you know, Hawaii and live a nice life.
[01:52:04.705 --> 01:52:09.589]  That means that God has called me to sacrifice all of that in order to bring the truth.
[01:52:10.330 --> 01:52:11.050]  That's what I'm saying.
[01:52:11.050 --> 01:52:12.391]  They don't cut my check.
[01:52:12.391 --> 01:52:16.753]  You listen to people that's getting their check cut by Jewish media.
[01:52:16.753 --> 01:52:19.734]  George Soros, come and meet with me directly.
[01:52:19.734 --> 01:52:23.416]  I told you, you ain't gonna send none of these people that you usually send.
[01:52:23.416 --> 01:52:26.017]  Charlamagne, we know all the names.
[01:52:26.017 --> 01:52:28.138]  Nori is a good guy.
[01:52:28.138 --> 01:52:29.318]  Like he said, he called me this morning.
[01:52:29.318 --> 01:52:32.200]  He said, maybe politics is a little bit too much for me.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:34.461]  Everybody back up off of Nori.
[01:52:34.461 --> 01:52:38.462]  This is like he was giving a platform, right?
[01:52:38.462 --> 01:52:39.443]  Which no one does.
[01:52:41.817 --> 01:52:43.878]  There's no free thought anymore.
[01:52:43.878 --> 01:52:52.220]  I give you one last bar before I get on this flight.
[01:52:52.220 --> 01:52:56.802]  In order for us to evolve, we have to walk forward.
[01:52:56.802 --> 01:52:58.883]  The left leg moving forward is the idea.
[01:52:58.883 --> 01:53:02.804]  The right leg moving forward is the actualization.
[01:53:02.804 --> 01:53:05.425]  I like the word actualization better than execution.
[01:53:06.670 --> 01:53:09.131]  We need the idea, we need to be realized.
[01:53:09.131 --> 01:53:11.912]  We need the idea, we need to be realized.
[01:53:11.912 --> 01:53:14.453]  Right now the thought police have us crawling.
[01:53:14.453 --> 01:53:17.474]  We have stopped evolving.
[01:53:17.474 --> 01:53:20.535]  We have to fight for free thought.
[01:53:20.535 --> 01:53:23.996]  To say how we feel and act upon that.
[01:53:23.996 --> 01:53:27.517]  In Jesus name, amen.
[01:53:27.517 --> 01:53:32.459]  Alright, so what Kanye is saying is, is that the media is controlled.
[01:53:32.459 --> 01:53:35.240]  You can use whatever name you want, whatever area you want to go to, but
[01:53:36.786 --> 01:53:44.954]  They're saying he's the villain, Alex Jones is the villain, but not the people creating bioweapons that could kill all of us.
[01:53:44.954 --> 01:53:50.139]  Not the people having worldwide lockdowns and poison shots.
[01:53:50.139 --> 01:53:51.220]  It really is a sick joke.
[01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:52.722]  So here's some of the articles.
[01:53:52.722 --> 01:53:59.068]  George Floyd's family files $250 million lawsuit against Kanye West, they said, using the Alex Jones plan.
[01:53:59.068 --> 01:53:59.729]  Played the clip earlier.
[01:54:02.892 --> 01:54:04.812]  It doesn't matter, George Floyd gave him $2 million.
[01:54:04.812 --> 01:54:07.393]  It doesn't matter, Kanye West gave him $2 million.
[01:54:07.393 --> 01:54:14.414]  Out of his own goodness of his heart, well, they want more now.
[01:54:14.414 --> 01:54:18.635]  But here is the coroner report.
[01:54:18.635 --> 01:54:27.636]  No life-threatening injuries, but had fentanyl, and another fentanyl, and methamphetamine, and a bunch of other stuff in his body.
[01:54:27.636 --> 01:54:30.917]  And that's all Kanye West said was this medical report.
[01:54:32.028 --> 01:54:38.170]  You see right here, all he did was quote, an admitted thing.
[01:54:38.170 --> 01:54:41.111]  He's not even wrong, he's right.
[01:54:41.111 --> 01:54:44.612]  But now, they've done that to him.
[01:54:44.612 --> 01:54:45.933]  Let's play this rap song.
[01:54:45.933 --> 01:54:50.234]  Rapper defends Alex Jones in Yay, an epic pro-free speech track.
[01:54:50.234 --> 01:54:51.995]  Rapper Bryson Gray.
[01:54:51.995 --> 01:54:53.175]  We'll go to break, come back.
[01:54:53.175 --> 01:54:57.657]  Got a big guest coming up that made the movie, The Real Anthony Fauci, off the best-selling book.
[01:54:58.530 --> 01:54:59.150]  That's all coming up.
[01:54:59.150 --> 01:55:02.271]  I've asked the crew to make a music video out of this, adding images to it.
[01:55:02.271 --> 01:55:03.692]  That'll be out the next day.
[01:55:03.692 --> 01:55:04.492]  Let's go ahead and roll this.
[01:55:17.626 --> 01:55:19.928]  Look what they did to Alex Jones.
[01:55:19.928 --> 01:55:22.731]  They trying to rob him of every single thing he owns.
[01:55:22.731 --> 01:55:26.134]  How you get sued for a billy for saying something wrong?
[01:55:26.134 --> 01:55:29.037]  They won't stop till everybody be in Wi-Fi drones.
[01:55:29.037 --> 01:55:30.819]  And look what they did to Ye.
[01:55:30.819 --> 01:55:31.960]  They want everything.
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:32.801]  JP Morgan, baby.
[01:55:33.161 --> 01:55:33.521]  I think?
[01:55:33.521 --> 01:55:33.861]  I think?
[01:56:00.026 --> 01:56:06.070]  Now they ratin' him and Mike Lindell without evidence Is this still America and what it represents?
[01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:18.339]  And that's why I'm out here flexin' while I'm slayin' demons We livin' in the end of times, you should sure seize it Politicians betray this country, they committin' treason It's all for power, so they laughin' while the country bleedin'
[01:56:19.645 --> 01:56:21.507]  Look what they did to Alex Jones.
[01:56:21.507 --> 01:56:24.629]  They trying to rob him of every single thing he owns.
[01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:28.072]  How you get sued for a billy for saying something wrong?
[01:56:28.072 --> 01:56:31.234]  They won't stop till everybody be in watch for drones.
[01:56:31.234 --> 01:56:32.755]  And look what they did to Ye.
[01:56:32.755 --> 01:56:33.896]  They want everything.
[01:56:33.896 --> 01:56:34.757]  JP Morgan banned.
[01:56:34.957 --> 01:56:35.417]  I'm good.
[01:56:52.475 --> 01:56:52.695]  Yeah!
[01:57:22.915 --> 01:57:32.439]  You can find Bryce and Gray's viral new hip-hop song on InfoWars.com.
[01:57:32.439 --> 01:57:34.840]  Mega Rapper defends Alex Jones.
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.220]  Yay!
[01:57:35.220 --> 01:57:37.601]  An epic pro free speech track.
[01:57:37.601 --> 01:57:40.462]  But yeah, they don't care about sex slavery or bio weapons.
[01:57:40.462 --> 01:57:42.723]  No, it's Kanye West and Alex Jones.
[01:57:42.723 --> 01:57:43.804]  It's yay and Alex.
[01:57:43.804 --> 01:57:49.026]  They're the bad guys.

[01:57:50.868 --> 01:57:54.611]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.

[01:58:20.071 --> 01:58:22.674]  Essential means without these things you die.
[01:58:22.674 --> 01:58:24.737]  And so much of the food is debased.
[01:58:24.737 --> 01:58:26.639]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.

[01:59:50.277 --> 01:59:56.161]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:10.387]  All right, the makers of the incredible new film, the real Anthony Fauci, that can bring down these murderers, are about to join us next segment.
[02:00:10.387 --> 02:00:11.928]  The trailer is six minutes long.
[02:00:11.928 --> 02:00:12.448]  Here's part of it.
[02:00:12.448 --> 02:00:14.730]  We'll post the full trailer at InfoWars.com.
[02:00:14.730 --> 02:00:15.251]  Here it is.
[02:00:15.251 --> 02:00:27.601]  You're really attacking not only Dr. Anthony Fauci, you're attacking science.
[02:00:27.601 --> 02:00:29.902]  Science has an air of authority.
[02:00:30.908 --> 02:00:36.612]  So people who want to push back on authority, push back on science.
[02:00:36.612 --> 02:00:41.215]  Science is about constant skepticism, constant questioning.
[02:00:41.215 --> 02:00:43.116]  And you didn't see any of that.
[02:00:43.116 --> 02:00:44.737]  You saw a narrative.
[02:00:44.737 --> 02:00:50.601]  In a 20-month period, they obliterated all the Bill of Rights, the United States Constitution.
[02:00:50.601 --> 02:00:52.502]  There's no objection in the American press.
[02:01:00.359 --> 02:01:07.850]  Normalcy only returns when we've largely vaccinated the entire global population.
[02:01:07.850 --> 02:01:10.715]  If the FDA says it's okay to take the vaccine, are you going to take it?
[02:01:10.715 --> 02:01:14.019]  I'm going to look at the data upon which the FDA makes that decision.
[02:01:17.017 --> 02:01:23.179]  They pay us hundreds of millions of dollars a year to hire and keep the reviewers to approve their product.
[02:01:23.179 --> 02:01:29.361]  The CDC continues to recommend that people who have been previously infected get their COVID-19 vaccine.
[02:01:29.361 --> 02:01:35.604]  CDC studies suggest getting the vaccine will offer you much stronger immunity to COVID than natural immunity.
[02:01:35.604 --> 02:01:37.044]  She's had the flu for 14 days.
[02:01:37.044 --> 02:01:38.204]  Should she get a flu shot?
[02:01:38.204 --> 02:01:38.645]  Well, no.
[02:01:38.645 --> 02:01:45.047]  If she got the flu for 14 days, she's as protected as anybody can be because the best vaccination is to get infected yourself.
[02:01:45.746 --> 02:01:51.772]  I've already had COVID, I'm protected, and now the study says maybe even more protected than the vaccine alone.
[02:01:51.772 --> 02:01:53.594]  Should they also get the vaccine?
[02:01:53.594 --> 02:01:56.437]  I don't have a really firm answer for you on that.
[02:01:56.437 --> 02:02:00.702]  People who have already had the virus, they recommended to get the vaccine as well.
[02:02:00.702 --> 02:02:01.663]  The answer is yes.
[02:02:05.752 --> 02:02:08.214]  Over 11,000 pages were released.
[02:02:08.214 --> 02:02:14.500]  The first bombshell in the document is that natural immunity works and Pfizer knows it.
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:20.105]  And there were no hospitalizations or deaths in the individuals who were vaccinated.
[02:02:20.105 --> 02:02:23.889]  But you now have three highly efficacious vaccines.
[02:02:23.889 --> 02:02:25.370]  There's no doubt about that.
[02:02:25.370 --> 02:02:29.054]  And there have been no hospitalizations or deaths in multiple countries.
[02:02:30.999 --> 02:02:37.166]  Another revelation from the documents was that adverse reactions were more frequent and more severe.
[02:02:37.166 --> 02:02:42.332]  It interestingly states some facts that have been labeled by the mainstream media as being misinformation.
[02:02:42.332 --> 02:02:46.497]  The consent form lists several possible side effects including myocarditis.
[02:02:50.069 --> 02:02:57.352]  A new study describes how 23 service members later developed chest pain and sought medical attention.
[02:02:57.352 --> 02:03:02.834]  82,000 per year to 863,000 neurological issues which would affect our pilots.
[02:03:02.834 --> 02:03:06.415]  Over a thousand percent increase in one year.
[02:03:06.415 --> 02:03:11.497]  And it looks like in the first three months there was 42,000 adverse events reported and 1,223 deaths.
[02:03:14.978 --> 02:03:22.505]  A total of 10,262 COVID-19 vaccine breakthrough infections had been reported from 46 U.S.
[02:03:22.505 --> 02:03:23.345]  states.
[02:03:23.345 --> 02:03:25.708]  If you get vaccinated, you are protected.
[02:03:25.708 --> 02:03:33.855]  For every one person that the vaccine saves from COVID, it kills four people from fatal cardiac arrest.
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:46.467]  If I want the population to ultimately accept my digital reality, I have to make sure the cognitive dissonance is so complete that you stop trusting your own brain.
[02:03:46.467 --> 02:03:47.528]  And guess what they've done?
[02:03:47.528 --> 02:03:54.053]  Exactly that!
[02:03:54.053 --> 02:04:04.320]  The reason that only one drug has been made available, AZT, because it's the only drug that thus far has been shown in scientifically controlled trials to be safe and effective.
[02:04:11.988 --> 02:04:22.875]  It's a counter-narrative that says the people who we think of as casualties of HIV were not actually dying from HIV.
[02:04:22.875 --> 02:04:28.799]  They were dying from a medicine that was supposedly treating HIV, but was actually killing them.
[02:04:30.845 --> 02:04:41.674]  You can't take what's normally a decade-long process for developing a product and ensuring its safety and efficacy and compressing it into six to nine months and not cut some corners.
[02:04:41.674 --> 02:04:43.035]  That's just absurd.
[02:04:43.035 --> 02:04:49.361]  We did not fund gain-of-function research to be conducted in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
[02:04:49.361 --> 02:04:57.608]  The preponderance of evidence now points towards this coming from the lab and what you've done is change the definition on your website to try to cover your ass, basically.
[02:04:58.715 --> 02:05:04.306]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[02:05:05.464 --> 02:05:18.609]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[02:05:18.609 --> 02:05:33.315]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout so you get an additional 10% off.

[02:05:37.964 --> 02:05:41.404]  They admit, once they've silenced us, they're coming for you.
[02:05:41.404 --> 02:05:44.185]  I am in your hands, and I'm asking for your support now.
[02:05:44.185 --> 02:05:48.506]  You have my commitment to never give up or back down, but I could give out without your support.
[02:05:48.506 --> 02:05:58.848]  Thank you for all your past support, and I'm encouraging you now to redouble your efforts at InfoWarsTore.com with promo code 1776 for an additional 10% off on the already big sales and huge discounts.
[02:06:04.040 --> 02:06:23.773]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:23.773 --> 02:06:26.114]  Everybody knows that I've stood in for a long time.
[02:06:26.114 --> 02:06:31.238]  No matter how wild a subject I cover, it's almost always based in reality.
[02:06:32.836 --> 02:06:34.337]  Sometimes I make mistakes, but rarely.
[02:06:34.337 --> 02:07:00.238]  And I can tell you, the book, The Real Anthony Fauci by Robert Kennedy Jr., and the new film made from that book is potentially the most important work ever produced because we have the breaking news of Boston University with a weaponized cobra that kills 80% of the mammals that come in contact with it.
[02:07:01.363 --> 02:07:03.504]  Total gain of function.
[02:07:03.504 --> 02:07:11.389]  We have all the news coming out that the vaccine isn't a vaccine, destroys your immunity, which we said years ago, according to the experts.
[02:07:11.389 --> 02:07:12.910]  And now the mass death that's happening.
[02:07:12.910 --> 02:07:16.192]  Jeff Hayes and Tony Lyons of Skyhorse Publishing join us.
[02:07:16.192 --> 02:07:17.652]  JeffHayesFilms.com.
[02:07:17.652 --> 02:07:19.934]  TheRealAnthonyFauciMovie.com.
[02:07:19.934 --> 02:07:22.435]  The film drops today.
[02:07:22.435 --> 02:07:23.736]  Everybody should see it.
[02:07:25.109 --> 02:07:25.890]  I have not seen it yet.
[02:07:25.890 --> 02:07:26.810]  I'm going to watch it tonight.
[02:07:26.810 --> 02:07:29.152]  I've talked to a lot of folks that sent it to me last night who did.
[02:07:29.152 --> 02:07:29.953]  It blew them away.
[02:07:29.953 --> 02:07:31.274]  We've seen advanced copies.
[02:07:31.274 --> 02:07:32.695]  I've seen the trailers.
[02:07:32.695 --> 02:07:33.375]  I've read the book.
[02:07:33.375 --> 02:07:34.496]  It's incredible.
[02:07:34.496 --> 02:07:40.020]  But they tried to censor this book unlike anything else except maybe The Great Reset and The War for the World.
[02:07:40.020 --> 02:07:40.681]  Probably even more.
[02:07:41.889 --> 02:07:42.029]  Let's
[02:07:59.662 --> 02:08:02.785]  The next lockdown, or the next release out of these labs.
[02:08:02.785 --> 02:08:04.826]  So this could be a more important time for this to be coming out.
[02:08:04.826 --> 02:08:08.349]  We're not going to just go away and forget what they did and let them hit us again.
[02:08:08.349 --> 02:08:15.255]  Tony Lyons of SkyhorsePublishing.com, the founder of the most independent, largest, most successful independent publishing house in the United States.
[02:08:15.255 --> 02:08:17.437]  I salute you for all your great work.
[02:08:17.437 --> 02:08:19.679]  Again, I don't want to say this dwarfs my book.
[02:08:20.219 --> 02:08:20.579]  I don't think so.
[02:08:43.610 --> 02:08:51.592]  So this project, when I read Bobby's book, I knew it had to be a film.
[02:08:51.592 --> 02:08:58.054]  This book, in spite of being the most suppressed book of my lifetime, sold a million copies.
[02:08:58.054 --> 02:09:00.175]  And it's a daunting read.
[02:09:00.175 --> 02:09:06.037]  We're looking at, in my copy, a 600-page book.
[02:09:06.037 --> 02:09:08.317]  It was a daunting read.
[02:09:08.317 --> 02:09:10.978]  But the story was profound.
[02:09:14.833 --> 02:09:23.576]  Well, I mean, Jeff, you're a very accomplished filmmaker.
[02:09:23.576 --> 02:09:33.658]  I might go over all of your success, but it's got to be scary, though, seeing the proof, the documentation, while you made this.
[02:09:33.658 --> 02:09:35.479]  Tell us about the film and why it's so important.
[02:09:36.761 --> 02:09:42.786]  Yeah, a lot of people, you know, I wasn't really familiar with Fauci's history.
[02:09:42.786 --> 02:09:47.250]  For me, he really appeared for the first time when he was standing next to Trump.
[02:09:47.250 --> 02:09:52.475]  And here's this avuncular, grandfatherly, seemingly rational guy.
[02:09:52.475 --> 02:09:54.877]  And I had a very positive view of him.
[02:09:54.877 --> 02:09:58.820]  Then the masks, you know, turn around when it seemed odd.
[02:09:58.820 --> 02:10:02.664]  But then when I read Bobby's book and saw his history,
[02:10:04.505 --> 02:10:30.496]  You know, really 1984 was the watershed year when he took over the infectious disease department at the NIH and took this little small, you know, not really important department and wrestled control of the AIDS virus and then just did despicable things that cost hundreds of thousands of lives and watched him then take this same playbook right into COVID.
[02:10:31.047 --> 02:10:31.868]  I totally agree.
[02:10:31.868 --> 02:10:43.278]  So, Jeff Hayes, the filmmaker of the real Anthony Fauci, if you had to describe Fauci in just a few words, Joseph Mengele 2.0, master criminal.
[02:10:43.278 --> 02:10:49.683]  I mean, when you really study him, it's hard to believe how much evil he's been involved in and what an incredible liar he is.
[02:10:49.683 --> 02:10:55.068]  Like telling Congress I'm not involved in gain of function, he holds conferences called in support of gain of function.
[02:10:55.068 --> 02:10:58.051]  I mean, this guy is as close to Satan as I could imagine.
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:01.601]  This actually has occurred before.
[02:11:01.601 --> 02:11:03.382]  There's a great example of it.
[02:11:03.382 --> 02:11:09.225]  A little bureaucrat named Harry Anslinger in the 20s took over the Bureau of Narcotics.
[02:11:09.225 --> 02:11:11.686]  He ended up running it for 50 years.
[02:11:11.686 --> 02:11:19.890]  He created the war on drugs in the 20s by telling the press that drugs were causing black men to crave white women.
[02:11:19.890 --> 02:11:25.292]  And they literally changed the caliber of bullets that police used based on Harry Anslinger.
[02:11:25.292 --> 02:11:26.273]  And his story
[02:11:27.213 --> 02:11:42.321]  You see it repeated in Fauci where you have a bureaucrat that takes over a not well-funded department and then suddenly gets a stunning amount of money and builds a power base that no one person should have.
[02:11:42.321 --> 02:11:51.886]  I want to get your take on the film and how people find it and get it and see it and share it, but undoubtedly there's a green light for Big Pharma taking over our government.
[02:11:51.886 --> 02:11:53.746]  I saw you on Steve Bannon a few days ago.
[02:11:56.121 --> 02:11:58.526]  And I thought you really knocked it out of the park, Tony Lyons.
[02:11:58.526 --> 02:12:00.190]  Can you repeat what you said and elaborate on it?
[02:12:01.607 --> 02:12:13.635]  Yeah, so, you know, this is a book that was the best-selling book in America despite the most incredible corruption and censorship that's ever been waged against a book.
[02:12:13.635 --> 02:12:29.866]  So they tried to shut this book down in every conceivable way, and they tried to do it because this book says that Dr. Fauci is working for big pharma at the expense of the American public, and that hundreds of thousands of people have died unnecessarily.
[02:12:30.246 --> 02:12:37.167]  That Dr. Fauci has helped the greediest and most corrupt people in this country take over the government.
[02:12:37.167 --> 02:12:39.688]  And this is a movie that people need to watch.
[02:12:39.688 --> 02:12:44.249]  And they need to make sure that these people cannot shut it down.
[02:12:44.249 --> 02:12:47.049]  So they did everything to shut the book down.
[02:12:47.049 --> 02:12:48.190]  They didn't shut it down.
[02:12:48.190 --> 02:12:54.891]  It sold a million copies, but I believe that it could have sold millions and millions of copies more if it wasn't shut down.
[02:12:55.231 --> 02:13:01.172]  And the movie is easier to watch, it's easier to understand, and it's so important.
[02:13:01.172 --> 02:13:07.274]  I don't think there's a single movie in this country that's more important for your viewers to watch.
[02:13:07.274 --> 02:13:17.556]  They should find it, they should share it, they should do whatever they can to encourage other people to watch it, because this is the movie that shows how their country is being run.
[02:13:18.530 --> 02:13:19.911]  And Tony, I totally agree with you.
[02:13:19.911 --> 02:13:22.673]  I want to get you and Jeff's take on this.
[02:13:22.673 --> 02:13:32.100]  What do you make of the beyond bombshell nightmare news of super weaponized COVID made in just the last six months at Boston University?
[02:13:32.100 --> 02:13:33.181]  They're saying it's illegal.
[02:13:33.181 --> 02:13:34.182]  They're saying they're not doing it.
[02:13:34.182 --> 02:13:38.605]  They go, oh yeah, we have super COVID, kills 80% of people that come in contact with it.
[02:13:38.605 --> 02:13:39.806]  I mean, these are madmen.
[02:13:39.806 --> 02:13:41.608]  This is like, this is out of control.
[02:13:43.925 --> 02:13:51.789]  This is just insane that there would be gain-of-function research being done in this country now after what's just happened.
[02:13:51.789 --> 02:13:55.411]  There's no way to make gain-of-function research safe.
[02:13:55.411 --> 02:14:01.055]  So the idea that it's going on is even more reason that viewers have to watch this movie.
[02:14:01.055 --> 02:14:05.717]  They have to see what's been going on in this country, and we all have to stop it.
[02:14:05.717 --> 02:14:12.161]  And we have to make sure that their congressional hearings to hold Dr. Fauci and the people who he's worked closely with
[02:14:12.581 --> 02:14:15.342]  Accountable for crimes against humanity.
[02:14:15.342 --> 02:14:19.004]  And there's no question that there have been crimes committed.
[02:14:19.004 --> 02:14:21.805]  That Dr. Fauci has lied repeatedly.
[02:14:21.805 --> 02:14:26.047]  And the film lays out the gain of functionality, because I read the synopsis and I'm going to watch it tonight.
[02:14:26.047 --> 02:14:29.269]  I'm going to come back to Jeff and you, Tony, but why are they so arrogant?
[02:14:29.269 --> 02:14:36.012]  I mean, once they get caught in the last year doing it, then they launch a weaponization program with the most deadly virus ever known and admit it?
[02:14:36.012 --> 02:14:38.293]  I mean, this is, what the hell's going on with these people?
[02:14:40.916 --> 02:14:45.559]  It's almost like they think they will never be held accountable.
[02:14:45.559 --> 02:14:48.520]  I literally have never seen anything like this.
[02:14:48.520 --> 02:14:55.024]  When a couple of weeks ago they gave EcoHealth Alliance another three million plus.
[02:14:55.024 --> 02:15:00.787]  This is like giving additional bullets to the person standing holding the smoking gun.
[02:15:00.787 --> 02:15:04.930]  It is a really ballsy move.
[02:15:04.930 --> 02:15:08.812]  It's like delivering your five-year-old daughter to a convicted pedophile.
[02:15:08.812 --> 02:15:09.032]  Sure.
[02:15:09.938 --> 02:15:30.198]  I mean, what people have to realize, too, when they see what happens to this movie is that there are going to be people coming out calling it misinformation, calling it conspiracy theory, and what those words are is that they're just words to get around the fact that this is real science, that these are real stories, and that this is the truth.
[02:15:30.698 --> 02:15:33.600]  And that people have to investigate it for themselves.
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:44.426]  Because misinformation, as it's used today, just means any narrative that contradicts what Dr. Fauci says, and what other government officials say.
[02:15:44.426 --> 02:15:47.648]  It doesn't mean that it's untrue.
[02:15:47.648 --> 02:15:49.349]  Stay there, Tony Lyons, Jeff Hays.
[02:15:49.349 --> 02:15:51.090]  Look, I can answer my own question.
[02:15:51.090 --> 02:15:51.930]  They're in deep trouble.
[02:15:51.930 --> 02:15:52.570]  Everybody's waking up.
[02:15:52.570 --> 02:15:54.491]  They have criminal investigations in the EU.
[02:15:54.491 --> 02:15:55.272]  They're just doubling down.
[02:15:57.213 --> 02:16:08.463]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[02:16:08.463 --> 02:16:10.365]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:16:10.365 --> 02:16:11.806]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:16:11.806 --> 02:16:13.348]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:16:13.348 --> 02:16:15.029]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[02:16:15.029 --> 02:16:16.310]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[02:16:16.310 --> 02:16:17.712]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[02:16:18.132 --> 02:16:22.976]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:16:22.976 --> 02:16:25.358]  And I warned the public, as a modern Paul Revere.
[02:16:25.358 --> 02:16:27.380]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:16:27.380 --> 02:16:34.326]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[02:16:34.966 --> 02:16:40.349]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[02:16:40.349 --> 02:16:49.293]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[02:16:49.293 --> 02:16:51.654]  1776 is the promo code.
[02:16:51.654 --> 02:16:57.097]  The destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[02:16:57.097 --> 02:17:00.379]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[02:17:01.960 --> 02:17:11.542]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[02:17:11.542 --> 02:17:27.764]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[02:17:27.764 --> 02:17:30.665]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[02:17:31.562 --> 02:17:38.148]  Because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[02:17:38.148 --> 02:17:39.850]  I don't take the credit.
[02:17:39.850 --> 02:17:41.571]  I give you the credit.
[02:17:41.571 --> 02:17:44.193]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.

[02:19:58.689 --> 02:20:03.292]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:20:03.292 --> 02:20:26.007]  It's Alex Jones!
[02:20:26.007 --> 02:20:27.948]  I really don't have words to describe
[02:20:29.881 --> 02:20:43.013]  How insane it is that in the first hour of this show today, I cover the New York Times, the Washington Post, you name it, going, oh yeah, over the decades they've created lots of viruses that'll kill 89% of us, but it's for our own good.
[02:20:43.013 --> 02:20:52.441]  Then they go in front of Congress, when the same people are interviewed bragging how they did it, like Fauci and others, and then say none of it's going on.
[02:20:52.441 --> 02:20:55.965]  That's why we've got to expose the real Anthony Fauci.
[02:20:57.270 --> 02:21:03.806]  That exposes Bill Gates and Peter Daszak and the UN and the whole corporate biomedical tyranny we're facing.
[02:21:06.824 --> 02:21:07.744]  I told you tonight.
[02:21:07.744 --> 02:21:08.644]  I told my wife.
[02:21:08.644 --> 02:21:10.905]  She wants to see it.
[02:21:10.905 --> 02:21:13.266]  The link was sent to me two days ago and I've been so hammered.
[02:21:13.266 --> 02:21:13.906]  I haven't watched it.
[02:21:13.906 --> 02:21:15.286]  I've watched the trailers.
[02:21:15.286 --> 02:21:16.426]  I've read the book.
[02:21:16.426 --> 02:21:19.387]  It's the most important work out there on understanding this crime.
[02:21:19.387 --> 02:21:20.327]  I'll be watching it tonight.
[02:21:20.327 --> 02:21:22.688]  The Real Anthony Fauci Movie dot com.
[02:21:22.688 --> 02:21:24.088]  Everybody should go there.
[02:21:24.088 --> 02:21:25.008]  Everybody should watch it.
[02:21:25.008 --> 02:21:31.270]  Going back to Jeff Hays, the great filmmaker that translated the book so quickly and so well into a film.
[02:21:31.270 --> 02:21:34.210]  Where are the different platforms for folks to go see this movie?
[02:21:34.210 --> 02:21:35.511]  They should have parties at their house.
[02:21:36.767 --> 02:21:38.328]  We're good to go.
[02:21:53.475 --> 02:21:57.556]  They can see the film at TheRealAnthonyFauciMovie.com.
[02:21:57.556 --> 02:22:01.397]  Our site has already been blacklisted by eight different services.
[02:22:01.397 --> 02:22:09.619]  I was on a radio interview with CBN this morning, and the host was saying, wow, I really wish I could see it, but the link doesn't work.
[02:22:09.619 --> 02:22:16.741]  And he described to me, one of their networks literally will not allow people to go to this site.
[02:22:16.741 --> 02:22:19.162]  And that happened before the film came out.
[02:22:20.063 --> 02:22:29.914]  And so they can't be reacting to the content, so we're going to have to play a little bit of cat and mouse to keep it out there, but we know how to do this, and it's that important.
[02:22:29.914 --> 02:22:32.537]  We're asking... So tell me, what are the different platforms it's on?
[02:22:32.537 --> 02:22:33.418]  Is it on Amazon?
[02:22:35.532 --> 02:22:36.232]  No, no, no, no.
[02:22:36.232 --> 02:22:39.113]  Amazon won't let us have it in any way.
[02:22:39.113 --> 02:22:41.134]  They won't let us sell a DVD.
[02:22:41.134 --> 02:22:44.135]  We did five appeals on selling a thumb drive.
[02:22:44.135 --> 02:22:46.936]  Okay, so they let my book out, but wow!
[02:22:46.936 --> 02:22:50.197]  Let's get the expert on this, Tony Lyons, to comment.
[02:22:50.197 --> 02:22:51.258]  This is unprecedented, Tony.
[02:22:53.294 --> 02:22:54.936]  Yeah, I've never seen anything like it.
[02:22:54.936 --> 02:22:59.640]  I mean, you know, if you have a better argument, you don't need censorship.
[02:22:59.640 --> 02:23:06.666]  You know, if you really believe that what you're saying is true, you don't have to shut down the opposing view.
[02:23:06.666 --> 02:23:12.531]  So, you know, Dr. Fauci has the entire world believing him now.
[02:23:12.531 --> 02:23:18.497]  And people watch this movie, they will no longer believe anything Dr. Fauci says.
[02:23:18.497 --> 02:23:19.498]  I guarantee you that.
[02:23:20.038 --> 02:23:21.879]  This is that important a movie.
[02:23:21.879 --> 02:23:24.160]  People have to recognize... It's guaranteed, Tony.
[02:23:24.160 --> 02:23:31.964]  Two weeks ago, the head spokesperson of the UN said, we run Google and all these other platforms to censor medical disinformation.
[02:23:31.964 --> 02:23:34.205]  But everything we said is turned out to be true.
[02:23:34.205 --> 02:23:34.825]  They're the liars.
[02:23:36.954 --> 02:23:37.475]  Sure.
[02:23:37.475 --> 02:23:47.564]  And, you know, everybody, I mean, I've said it before, but misinformation is just a way to shut down opposing views, counter narratives.
[02:23:47.564 --> 02:23:58.473]  So what we need, if you disagree with this, you should come out and watch the movie, make a statement, explain to the world why things in the movie or in the book are incorrect.
[02:23:58.473 --> 02:24:02.357]  And the fact that people can't do that is why they need censorship.
[02:24:03.527 --> 02:24:07.771]  But as we speak, the site is up, at least a few minutes ago.
[02:24:07.771 --> 02:24:10.414]  Jeff Hays, The Real Anthony Fauci Movie dot com.
[02:24:10.414 --> 02:24:11.716]  Everybody's got to see this movie.
[02:24:13.652 --> 02:24:27.281]  Yeah, I started working on this film in January, and you'll notice at the end, the credits, half of the people in the credits are redacted because they didn't want their name associated to the film.
[02:24:27.281 --> 02:24:30.803]  I jokingly call this my career ending film.
[02:24:30.803 --> 02:24:37.028]  I literally had to stop and think, you know, is it worth doing this to get this out?
[02:24:37.028 --> 02:24:39.749]  Because I've seen what's happened to Bobby Kennedy Jr.
[02:24:39.749 --> 02:24:43.412]  I've seen what's happened to his life, to his income.
[02:24:44.232 --> 02:24:50.517]  And then, eventually, you come to the right decision that's like, wait a minute, this is worth it.
[02:24:50.517 --> 02:24:51.577]  If not me, who?
[02:24:51.577 --> 02:24:53.339]  And it's time to stand up.
[02:24:53.339 --> 02:24:54.699]  Well, that's where I am.
[02:24:54.699 --> 02:24:57.161]  All the giant signs against us, none of it's true.
[02:24:57.161 --> 02:24:59.302]  And you just learn, hey, I'm doing important work here.
[02:24:59.302 --> 02:25:00.964]  You got to do it.
[02:25:00.964 --> 02:25:01.624]  Wow.
[02:25:01.624 --> 02:25:02.625]  I haven't seen the film yet.
[02:25:02.625 --> 02:25:04.346]  I'm going to watch it tonight.
[02:25:04.346 --> 02:25:05.747]  Lay out what's in the film, Jeff.
[02:25:07.256 --> 02:25:13.038]  So we start out with what happened in 2019-2020.
[02:25:13.038 --> 02:25:24.223]  The film opens with Event 201, where they're doing a tabletop game of a coronavirus six weeks before the COVID-19 was first announced.
[02:25:24.223 --> 02:25:26.284]  And then you see that playbook follow out.
[02:25:27.049 --> 02:25:44.396]  Once we completely explore what happened in 2020, then we go back to 1984 and we show the AIDS crisis and how it was handled and the damage that was done, and you start to get an idea of how he built this power base.
[02:25:44.816 --> 02:25:55.900]  This man has given away, has overseen the grants and funding of almost a trillion dollars in his career, 930 billion dollars.
[02:25:55.900 --> 02:26:01.482]  So you can imagine the people that are beholden to him, that are scared to speak out against him.
[02:26:01.482 --> 02:26:11.765]  Fortunately, with him retiring, those type regimes, once he doesn't control the checkbook, I think those people will end up turning on him and it's going to be interesting to watch.
[02:26:12.466 --> 02:26:14.528]  Well, that was my next question.
[02:26:14.528 --> 02:26:16.150]  Congressional criminal hearings.
[02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:17.352]  We'll play this next segment.
[02:26:17.352 --> 02:26:18.493]  EU criminal hearings.
[02:26:18.493 --> 02:26:20.075]  Criminal investigations.
[02:26:20.075 --> 02:26:25.462]  I mean, I don't put sugarcoating on things, but the silver lining is, Tony, the world's waking up.
[02:26:27.290 --> 02:26:42.101]  The world is definitely waking up and people are flocking to other platforms because they know that the media is controlled, that big tech is controlled, and that their government is captured by big pharmaceutical companies.
[02:26:42.101 --> 02:26:50.087]  So, more and more people are standing up, speaking out, and not allowing this globalist
[02:26:50.627 --> 02:26:57.832]  You know, sort of regime, this globalist narrative to take over this country and this world.
[02:26:57.832 --> 02:27:10.901]  And we all need to fight, but we need to watch movies like this, watch shows like yours, and really begin to understand, to wake up to the way the things, the world is really working now.
[02:27:10.901 --> 02:27:11.441]  Well, that's right.
[02:27:11.441 --> 02:27:13.082]  This is a total information war.
[02:27:13.082 --> 02:27:13.623]  Let me ask you this.
[02:27:13.623 --> 02:27:16.925]  We'll go to break, come back and play some of the EU criminal investigation starting.
[02:27:17.774 --> 02:27:23.341]  If you're a big pharma and you already control the government, why not just sell something that works or is a placebo, at least doesn't hurt people?
[02:27:23.341 --> 02:27:26.665]  We know CDC documents in 2000 predicted it would do all this.
[02:27:26.665 --> 02:27:31.331]  Why would they bring out a drug that hurts people?
[02:27:31.331 --> 02:27:32.332]  This is bigger than profit.
[02:27:32.332 --> 02:27:33.193]  What do you think is happening here?
[02:27:34.938 --> 02:27:38.342]  Yeah, so that's just so scary to think about.
[02:27:38.342 --> 02:27:42.867]  It's really clear that this is about money and power.
[02:27:42.867 --> 02:27:49.754]  And the details of why they're doing it in the specific way that they're doing it is just beyond my comprehension.
[02:27:49.754 --> 02:27:52.798]  But I think people just have to recognize that this is happening.
[02:27:53.158 --> 02:28:20.556]  That freedom of speech is being shut down in this country, that people's rights are being taken from them, that people are being forced to take a vaccine that hasn't been well tested and that is winding up, killing people, injuring people, landing them in the hospital, that we're not getting real science, real research, and that the people who are fighting tooth and nail to tell the truth to the American public, those are the heroes and those are the people
[02:28:21.116 --> 02:28:29.080]  Where we're told time after time that it's misinformation, it's a conspiracy theory, that it's a narrative that isn't true.
[02:28:29.080 --> 02:28:30.761]  But we've been proven totally correct.
[02:28:30.761 --> 02:28:31.441]  Stay there.
[02:28:31.441 --> 02:28:35.143]  Both Jeff Hayes, the filmmaker, and Tony Lyons that got the book published.
[02:28:35.143 --> 02:28:35.944]  Incredible.
[02:28:35.944 --> 02:28:37.725]  TheRealAnthonyFauciMovie.com.
[02:28:37.725 --> 02:28:41.086]  Folks, I know you already know all this or you think you do.
[02:28:41.086 --> 02:28:43.227]  You are the vector of the truth.
[02:28:43.227 --> 02:28:47.049]  You, the viewers, have to go get the film and show it to your friends and family now.
[02:28:47.049 --> 02:28:49.291]  We will bring these people to justice or
[02:28:50.470 --> 02:28:52.152]  They got new bioweapons ready for us.
[02:28:52.152 --> 02:28:53.734]  I'm not going to take it lying down.
[02:28:53.734 --> 02:28:54.314]  Go see the film.
[02:28:54.314 --> 02:28:58.018]  We'll be right back.
[02:28:58.018 --> 02:29:04.084]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[02:29:04.084 --> 02:29:07.208]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[02:29:08.285 --> 02:29:13.207]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[02:29:13.207 --> 02:29:16.729]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[02:29:16.729 --> 02:29:17.569]  It's game over.
[02:29:17.569 --> 02:29:23.272]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[02:29:23.272 --> 02:29:27.874]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[02:29:27.874 --> 02:29:34.037]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.
[02:29:34.517 --> 02:29:46.487]  And that's why when you go to InfoWarsStore.com and get amazing products that empower you and your body and your immune system and that of your family, you're also empowering the tip of the spear in the fight against the globalists.
[02:29:46.487 --> 02:29:52.472]  The fight starts at InfoWars.com and the support of the fight starts at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:29:52.472 --> 02:29:54.274]  God bless and thank you all for your support.
[02:29:57.773 --> 02:30:09.559]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[02:30:10.529 --> 02:30:13.730]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[02:30:13.730 --> 02:30:22.634]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live, and people don't listen, and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[02:30:22.634 --> 02:30:24.614]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[02:30:24.614 --> 02:30:26.135]  I don't plan to miss your health.
[02:30:26.135 --> 02:30:33.758]  But if I wasn't taking products like X3 from InfoWarshaw.com, I could not continue to do what I'm doing today.
[02:30:34.278 --> 02:30:36.319]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[02:31:01.648 --> 02:31:09.076]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[02:31:09.076 --> 02:31:10.978]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[02:31:10.978 --> 02:31:12.440]  That's what they want to take away.
[02:31:12.440 --> 02:31:13.941]  Your ability to speak freely.
[02:31:13.941 --> 02:31:15.683]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[02:31:15.683 --> 02:31:16.924]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[02:31:16.924 --> 02:31:18.326]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[02:31:18.746 --> 02:31:23.592]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[02:31:23.592 --> 02:31:25.995]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[02:31:25.995 --> 02:31:27.997]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[02:31:27.997 --> 02:31:34.965]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet about East America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[02:31:35.586 --> 02:31:40.968]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.
[02:31:40.968 --> 02:31:49.910]  So I salute you and I thank you and I ask you now, at the critical juncture of the battle, to redouble your efforts by visiting InfoWarsStore.com and getting amazing products that keep us on air.
[02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:52.271]  1776 is the promo code.
[02:31:52.271 --> 02:31:57.733]  The destination is InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you all for your support.
[02:31:57.733 --> 02:31:58.693]  By the will of God,
[02:31:59.949 --> 02:32:09.420]  And by God working through you and your support, InfoWars continues to persevere against attacks never before seen in the Western world against independent media.
[02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:11.042]  Thanks for keeping me in the fight.
[02:32:11.042 --> 02:32:18.270]  And over the years, you have come to the table, you have stepped to the plate so many times and kept InfoWars and free speech on the air, and I thank you.
[02:32:18.710 --> 02:32:23.174]  But now, I have my own legal bills that have reached the point that I can't pay them.
[02:32:23.174 --> 02:32:24.435]  And I need your support.
[02:32:24.435 --> 02:32:32.062]  So if you want to keep this operation moving forward, if you want to back me in this fight against the globalists, please visit SaveInfoWars.com
[02:32:33.883 --> 02:32:40.906]  And SaveInfoWars.com takes you to a URL at GiveSendGo for direct Alex Jones Legal Defense Fund.
[02:32:40.906 --> 02:32:45.448]  This whole phase of their attacks, four years in the making, is almost over.
[02:32:45.448 --> 02:32:49.670]  And right at the end, we're not giving up, we're not giving in, but we could give out.
[02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:57.074]  So please, if you support what we're doing and want to fight for liberty and freedom and justice in the future, go to SaveInfoWars.com today.
[02:32:58.402 --> 02:33:11.893]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:11.893 --> 02:33:17.598]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:34.949 --> 02:33:45.932]  Well, I told listeners that the whole Sandy Hook propaganda campaign against us was synthetic.
[02:34:02.242 --> 02:34:02.682]  And we knew it.
[02:34:02.682 --> 02:34:03.583]  It was all coordinated.
[02:34:03.583 --> 02:34:04.903]  The judge said, no, you can't say that.
[02:34:04.903 --> 02:34:06.104]  You can't bring that up.
[02:34:06.104 --> 02:34:07.585]  You've been found guilty by me.
[02:34:07.585 --> 02:34:15.649]  They've now put out press releases bragging it was all coordinated by Bloomberg and other groups in the last four years to bring me down, they think, than to bring you down.
[02:34:15.649 --> 02:34:18.990]  We're going to be covering that after our guests leave.
[02:34:18.990 --> 02:34:23.993]  That's one thing these supervillains love to do is brag about what they've done.
[02:34:23.993 --> 02:34:28.115]  Literally take stuff I didn't even really say out of context, twist it, make it a huge issue.
[02:34:28.775 --> 02:34:30.036]  And then rig the whole thing.
[02:34:30.036 --> 02:34:32.016]  And I think that's their plan to shut us down.
[02:34:32.016 --> 02:34:33.837]  They'll never shut us down.
[02:34:33.837 --> 02:34:36.819]  Humanity is awake now.
[02:34:36.819 --> 02:34:38.459]  Okay.
[02:34:38.459 --> 02:34:43.922]  I want to play Melissa Fleming, the head of the UN's Information Bureau.
[02:34:43.922 --> 02:34:55.147]  I want to play this clip of her just a few weeks ago saying, Google and others take the orders from the United Nations on what can be heard and what can't be heard.
[02:34:57.045 --> 02:34:59.068]  You know, we partnered with Google, for example.
[02:34:59.068 --> 02:35:06.598]  If you Google climate change, you will, at the top of your search, you will get all kinds of UN resources.
[02:35:07.614 --> 02:35:17.962]  We started this partnership when we were shocked to see that when we Googled climate change, we were getting incredibly distorted information right at the top.
[02:35:17.962 --> 02:35:21.284]  So we're becoming much more proactive.
[02:35:21.284 --> 02:35:28.850]  We own the science and we think that the world should know it and the platforms themselves also do.
[02:35:28.850 --> 02:35:34.314]  But again, it's a huge, huge challenge that I think
[02:35:35.154 --> 02:35:40.018]  All sectors of society need to be very active in.
[02:35:40.018 --> 02:35:47.684]  They own the science, even though everything they told you, from blocking therapeutics to claiming that the vaccine was a vaccine or that it worked.
[02:35:47.684 --> 02:35:48.985]  Now, here's a very important clip.
[02:35:48.985 --> 02:36:03.756]  Here's a member of the European Union Parliament, Kristin Turas, calls for the immediate resignation of the president, Ursula van der Laan, who it turns out signed secret deals with Pfizer and Moderna for the forced injections.
[02:36:03.756 --> 02:36:04.117]  Here it is.
[02:36:05.484 --> 02:36:23.314]  Ursula von der Leyen must immediately and unconditionally resign from her position as President of the European Commission due to the fact that her actions are currently criminally investigated by the European Public Prosecutor's Office.
[02:36:23.314 --> 02:36:34.501]  EPPO just announced a few days ago that it's investigating the way the contracts were signed between the European Commission and the producers of vaccines and this is what
[02:36:35.785 --> 02:36:56.290]  The Court of Auditors just stated in a report released a few days ago, and I quote, The Commission has signed, up to November 2021, 71 billion euros worth of contracts on behalf of the Member States to purchase up to 4.6 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses.
[02:36:56.290 --> 02:37:04.112]  That means that she purchased 10 doses of vaccines for every EU citizen based on contracts that were never released to the public.
[02:37:04.884 --> 02:37:09.946]  This is how the contracts that she signed with these pharmaceutical companies were released to the public.
[02:37:09.946 --> 02:37:16.388]  How is this possible in a European Union that is called to be transparent with the ways using people's money?
[02:37:16.388 --> 02:37:22.130]  So I'm asking again and calling again for immediate and unconditional resignation.
[02:37:22.130 --> 02:37:24.331]  Thank you.
[02:37:24.331 --> 02:37:25.911]  This is an information war.
[02:37:25.911 --> 02:37:30.573]  Jeff Hayes made the film based on the number one best-selling book
[02:37:31.803 --> 02:37:47.664]  The Real Anthony Fauci, TheRealAnthonyFauciMovie.com, Jeff Hays, comments on the situation, and Tony Lyons, who's had the courage as one of the, now, the biggest independent publisher, but one of the biggest publishers now, promoting truth and freedom, about what this signifies.
[02:37:49.837 --> 02:37:53.739]  The amount of money at stake here is staggering.
[02:37:53.739 --> 02:37:58.101]  Where you have now Big Pharma is the biggest industry.
[02:37:58.101 --> 02:38:01.523]  When I grew up, it was always oil and gas was the biggest.
[02:38:01.523 --> 02:38:04.525]  They have more lobbyists in Washington, D.C.
[02:38:04.525 --> 02:38:06.446]  than there are congressmen, senators.
[02:38:07.006 --> 02:38:09.268]  Supreme Court justices.
[02:38:09.268 --> 02:38:16.193]  The power that they wield by the staggering amount of money that they're making.
[02:38:16.193 --> 02:38:20.415]  And as we become less healthy, we become better customers for them.
[02:38:20.415 --> 02:38:26.240]  It is a very sick system built by some very greedy people.
[02:38:26.240 --> 02:38:28.621]  And here they are trying to suppress your film.
[02:38:28.621 --> 02:38:32.544]  You know, when Orson Welles had Citizen Kane suppressed, he became a cost celeb.
[02:38:32.544 --> 02:38:35.226]  But now the left loves censoring people, Tony Lyons.
[02:38:36.843 --> 02:38:42.145]  Yeah, if you really own the science, why do you have to shut down the counter-argument?
[02:38:42.145 --> 02:38:49.448]  The real Anthony Fauci book and the real Anthony Fauci movie, this has 2,194 citations.
[02:38:49.448 --> 02:38:54.330]  It cites hundreds and hundreds of peer-reviewed studies.
[02:38:54.330 --> 02:38:56.091]  It was meticulously researched.
[02:38:56.631 --> 02:39:00.613]  If they really own the science, then they should fight about the science.
[02:39:00.613 --> 02:39:05.014]  They should not try to shut down every counter-argument.
[02:39:05.014 --> 02:39:06.655]  That's a sign of weakness.
[02:39:06.655 --> 02:39:11.897]  That's a sign that they're corrupt, that they're greedy, that it's not about public health.
[02:39:11.897 --> 02:39:13.417]  It's not about science.
[02:39:13.417 --> 02:39:15.198]  It's about money and power.
[02:39:15.738 --> 02:39:17.339]  Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:39:17.339 --> 02:39:26.605]  was right about the Hudson River, he was right about mercury and early childhood vaccines, he was right about Monsanto, and he's right about Dr. Fauci.
[02:39:26.605 --> 02:39:42.194]  Dr. Fauci, on the other hand, has lied repeatedly, and he's brought you and brought this country to a point where we no longer have our freedoms, and we need to fight back and reclaim our freedoms after this insane period.
[02:39:42.194 --> 02:39:43.015]  And that's a key point.
[02:39:43.735 --> 02:39:51.165]  He's not wrong, he's lying on purpose, and it's a biomedical takeover that we're witnessing.
[02:39:51.165 --> 02:39:55.050]  And we're not tooting our horn here, but I mean, everything they said was a lie.
[02:39:55.050 --> 02:39:58.574]  They admit the shot doesn't work, makes you sick, erases your immune system.
[02:39:58.574 --> 02:40:01.739]  I don't think this Tony Lyons is going the way they thought it would go.
[02:40:03.644 --> 02:40:25.342]  No, I think that they thought that using these incredible new methods of censoring any kind of a counter-argument, you know, any kind of real dialogue in this country, any kind of real marketplace of ideas, that they were just going to have ultimate control over every narrative.
[02:40:25.342 --> 02:40:29.205]  And what they're finding is that people are not that easy to fool.
[02:40:29.545 --> 02:40:48.793]  That people are fighting back, they're watching shows that tell the truth, and that they're not willing to accept this narrative and this situation where we're losing all of our freedom and where the truth is just supposed to be whatever they tell us it is.
[02:40:48.793 --> 02:40:49.633]  And I totally agree.
[02:40:49.633 --> 02:40:50.494]  Let's do one more segment.
[02:40:51.620 --> 02:40:54.444]  Here's the demarcation line.
[02:40:54.444 --> 02:40:58.769]  When we're asleep and we don't think the social contract's broken, we're easy to manipulate.
[02:40:58.769 --> 02:41:04.235]  But as soon as it's broken, we're not these compliant slaves we were before, and now that compliance isn't there.
[02:41:04.235 --> 02:41:06.037]  I think that's what you're saying.
[02:41:06.037 --> 02:41:11.524]  No matter what they try or do now, I can feel it, I can see it, they're going to pay for what they've done.
[02:41:12.751 --> 02:41:29.895]  Sure, and I mean, Jeff Hayes has done heroic work here to bring this story to the American public so that they can see that they've been lied to, they've been duped, and that what they believe is misinformation or conspiracy theories is just a different point of view.
[02:41:29.895 --> 02:41:35.796]  And it's a point of view that is not about taking your money and your power and your freedom.
[02:41:35.796 --> 02:41:38.876]  It's about letting you live your life in a healthy way.
[02:41:38.876 --> 02:41:41.337]  Well, it's also a point of view, when he started out eight months ago making it,
[02:41:42.037 --> 02:41:45.038]  When it was proven we were right, but now it's totally proven right.
[02:41:45.038 --> 02:41:46.299]  Jeff, how does that feel?
[02:41:46.299 --> 02:41:48.440]  Because everything in your film is evergreen now.
[02:41:48.440 --> 02:41:52.721]  I mean, the wheel is spinning, the pendulum is moving.
[02:41:52.721 --> 02:41:54.382]  I mean, this is the biggest issue right now.
[02:41:55.769 --> 02:41:59.732]  I was much more afraid in January, February, March.
[02:41:59.732 --> 02:42:04.736]  Every day that goes by, they have a reality problem.
[02:42:04.736 --> 02:42:08.199]  People are seeing that the vaccine didn't work.
[02:42:08.199 --> 02:42:10.000]  They're seeing the injuries.
[02:42:10.000 --> 02:42:12.962]  They're seeing the myocarditis with their own eyes.
[02:42:12.962 --> 02:42:18.507]  And you can only deny it so long until people see it with their own eyes.
[02:42:18.507 --> 02:42:23.631]  And they're seeing it in parents that are not willing to get their children vaccinated.
[02:42:24.271 --> 02:42:25.191]  I totally agree.
[02:42:25.191 --> 02:42:26.072]  The timing is God.
[02:42:43.373 --> 02:42:48.719]  We're gonna come back, find a little segment, talk about what the viewers can do and not just be passive slaves, passive victims.
[02:42:48.719 --> 02:42:58.069]  How do all the millions listening take action and drive this film to number one in the world and bring Fauci to justice?
[02:42:58.069 --> 02:42:58.810]  It's our bestseller.
[02:42:59.909 --> 02:43:03.672]  We first came out with it five years ago and it was a moderate seller.
[02:43:03.672 --> 02:43:12.738]  But as folks tried Vitamin Mineral Fusion and experienced the way it made them feel and how healthy it made them, it has become our number one overall bestseller.
[02:43:12.738 --> 02:43:15.360]  And it's been sold out for a while but it's finally back in stock.
[02:43:15.360 --> 02:43:22.004]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion doesn't just supercharge your immune system, but it helps every cellular function of the body.
[02:43:22.004 --> 02:43:23.005]  It has all the minerals.
[02:43:23.545 --> 02:43:24.946]  All the key amino acids.
[02:43:24.946 --> 02:43:29.107]  All of the essential vitamins that you need to live and be healthy.
[02:43:29.107 --> 02:43:31.708]  Essential means without these things you die.
[02:43:31.708 --> 02:43:33.769]  And so much of the food is debased.
[02:43:33.769 --> 02:43:35.690]  There's so many chemicals in the environment.
[02:43:35.690 --> 02:43:39.811]  It is critical to bolster our body's defenses with a product like this.
[02:43:39.811 --> 02:43:42.032]  Now there are other great vitamin mineral products out there.
[02:43:42.532 --> 02:43:46.716]  But this is amongst the very best, and it's a low price, and it funds the InfoWare.

[02:43:53.783 --> 02:43:57.166]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion, back in stock, InfoWareStore.com.
[02:43:59.227 --> 02:44:04.108]  I have been in a 28-year marathon battle with the globalists.
[02:44:04.108 --> 02:44:10.509]  I have come from nowhere, to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[02:44:10.509 --> 02:44:15.650]  We are engaging the globalists at point-blank range in the information war.
[02:44:15.650 --> 02:44:17.351]  But I don't deserve the credit.
[02:44:17.351 --> 02:44:23.712]  Yes, I've persevered, but the listeners and viewers who support InfoWars are the real reason we have this success.
[02:44:24.492 --> 02:44:29.933]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the New World Order we've ever had.
[02:44:29.933 --> 02:44:34.274]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[02:44:34.274 --> 02:44:43.476]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[02:44:43.476 --> 02:44:44.816]  God bless you all.
[02:44:44.816 --> 02:44:45.877]  I salute you.
[02:44:45.877 --> 02:44:46.977]  I thank you.
[02:44:46.977 --> 02:44:52.318]  And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now because we are over the target and history is happening.
[02:44:53.018 --> 02:44:54.319]  The fight is my fight.
[02:44:54.319 --> 02:44:54.939]  It's your fight.
[02:44:54.939 --> 02:44:55.700]  It's our fight.
[02:44:55.700 --> 02:44:56.500]  God bless you all.
[02:45:11.613 --> 02:45:11.733]  You're
[02:45:27.927 --> 02:45:30.789]  Your libido, and number one, your immune system.

[02:47:14.992 --> 02:47:28.596]  It makes me physically sick to read mainstream news that Fauci and Daszak have level 4 bioweapon labs in Boston with weapons that kill 80% of humans.
[02:47:28.596 --> 02:47:34.117]  This is a clear and present danger against all of humanity, and anyone listening should be aware of this and upset.
[02:47:34.117 --> 02:47:39.399]  I have four children, I plan on having grandchildren, and this is an affront to all of
[02:47:40.447 --> 02:47:44.248]  Human life on this planet, it is disgusting.
[02:47:44.248 --> 02:47:46.769]  So we're in an information war.
[02:47:46.769 --> 02:47:51.710]  And yes, this broadcast is about promoting whatever is the truth, whatever is most effective against tyranny.
[02:47:51.710 --> 02:47:55.311]  And the film, the RealAnthonyFauciMovie.com is critical.
[02:47:55.311 --> 02:47:59.512]  I'll be watching it tonight with my wife and my children.
[02:47:59.512 --> 02:48:00.753]  JeffHaysFilms.com.
[02:48:00.753 --> 02:48:06.935]  Jeff Hays, looking at this, and just a call to arms politically, this is an information war.
[02:48:06.935 --> 02:48:08.235]  We talk about that constantly.
[02:48:09.848 --> 02:48:13.989]  The saying goes, the propaganda wouldn't be necessary if the situation was hopeless.
[02:48:13.989 --> 02:48:17.490]  They are so scared of the book, thanks to Robert Kennedy Jr.
[02:48:17.490 --> 02:48:24.112]  and Tony Lyons, and they're so scared of your film that has the potential to reach 10, 20, 30 times that.
[02:48:24.112 --> 02:48:27.313]  We are so close to bringing them to justice.
[02:48:27.313 --> 02:48:30.754]  I just played clips of criminal investigations in the EU.
[02:48:30.754 --> 02:48:31.554]  Your final comments.
[02:48:34.395 --> 02:48:44.750]  Well, this film, now we have something that people can share and share with family members who did not agree with them before.
[02:48:46.346 --> 02:48:50.350]  Bobby, in the book, put together a bulletproof case.
[02:48:50.350 --> 02:48:52.852]  He's a brilliant trial lawyer.
[02:48:52.852 --> 02:48:54.433]  And the case is there.
[02:48:54.433 --> 02:49:12.650]  And so now we have something in a digestible format that people can share with their friends, their relatives, the people they work with, and more importantly, with public health officials who've been misled, that are still making bad decisions based on bad information.
[02:49:13.840 --> 02:49:15.301]  It's free, by the way.
[02:49:15.301 --> 02:49:20.084]  It's free for the next nine days, so we really made this easy for people to see.
[02:49:20.084 --> 02:49:27.850]  Oh, that was probably important to say, because I didn't talk to you guys before you came on, because I don't make money, it takes a lot of money to make a film, and I've seen the clips, it's incredible.
[02:49:27.850 --> 02:49:31.813]  We're going to put this up front, we're live right now, but we archived this at Mandop Video.
[02:49:31.813 --> 02:49:33.454]  I'm going to put this up front.
[02:49:33.454 --> 02:49:35.555]  The film is free!
[02:49:35.555 --> 02:49:37.196]  Wow!
[02:49:37.196 --> 02:49:37.917]  Tell us about that.
[02:49:39.324 --> 02:49:42.585]  So this is the strategy we decided to use.
[02:49:42.585 --> 02:49:47.107]  A percentage of the people that watch the whole film for free will choose to buy it.
[02:49:47.107 --> 02:49:49.348]  And we just decided to trust the people.
[02:49:49.348 --> 02:49:51.549]  And it's a paradox.
[02:49:51.549 --> 02:49:55.870]  Hopefully, the more we give away, the more money we make.
[02:49:55.870 --> 02:49:59.092]  If people like it and want to put it in their library, they can buy it.
[02:49:59.092 --> 02:50:02.473]  But for 10 days, they can watch it for free and share it for free.
[02:50:04.267 --> 02:50:06.989]  Okay, well again, I didn't talk to Tony or you beforehand.
[02:50:06.989 --> 02:50:08.911]  I saw you guys on Steve Bannon.
[02:50:08.911 --> 02:50:10.472]  Said I wanted to get you on a few days ago.
[02:50:10.472 --> 02:50:11.653]  You came on.
[02:50:11.653 --> 02:50:13.354]  So like I said, we're not coordinating this.
[02:50:13.354 --> 02:50:14.575]  I wish, I mean, I'm surprised.
[02:50:14.575 --> 02:50:16.676]  I don't know how you're going to pay for a film this good.
[02:50:16.676 --> 02:50:18.898]  But perfect.
[02:50:18.898 --> 02:50:21.039]  Oh wow, that's going to make it even bigger.
[02:50:21.039 --> 02:50:22.741]  Listeners, you better go get it.
[02:50:22.741 --> 02:50:24.002]  You better have viewing parties.
[02:50:24.002 --> 02:50:25.243]  You better share it.
[02:50:25.243 --> 02:50:26.503]  You better support it.
[02:50:26.503 --> 02:50:27.824]  Start over again.
[02:50:27.824 --> 02:50:30.346]  The movie is free.
[02:50:30.346 --> 02:50:31.567]  Incredible, Jeff Hays.
[02:50:31.567 --> 02:50:32.408]  Tell us how we find it.
[02:50:33.709 --> 02:50:42.485]  TheRealAnthonyFauciMovie.com TheRealAnthonyFauciMovie.com and for how many days is it free?
[02:50:43.649 --> 02:50:51.477]  So nine more days, and you know, again, we're having to move it around just to keep it up for free for nine days.
[02:50:51.477 --> 02:51:08.093]  One of our editors sent us a clip for us to review a month ago of his work on a section of the film, put it on his private YouTube page, non-public facing, password protected, and YouTube took it off of his private page for violating their content policy.
[02:51:08.832 --> 02:51:10.353]  So this is not easy.
[02:51:10.353 --> 02:51:11.754]  Well, I like the way you think.
[02:51:11.754 --> 02:51:14.875]  And so you already had my support.
[02:51:14.875 --> 02:51:19.398]  And quite frankly, I said, hey, you guys ought to sponsor run ads, but I want to promote your film regardless.
[02:51:19.398 --> 02:51:21.219]  I didn't know they were giving away for free.
[02:51:21.219 --> 02:51:22.440]  Oh, my God.
[02:51:22.440 --> 02:51:23.700]  Because I've seen the trailers.
[02:51:23.700 --> 02:51:25.802]  They are like HBO quality.
[02:51:25.802 --> 02:51:29.544]  I read his book six months ago.
[02:51:29.544 --> 02:51:31.945]  Gave me a headache because I knew most of it, didn't know some of it.
[02:51:31.945 --> 02:51:33.586]  And it was just so scary.
[02:51:33.586 --> 02:51:34.687]  Six hundred pages of truth.
[02:51:36.081 --> 02:51:38.404]  But it's in a film that's so easy to watch.
[02:51:38.404 --> 02:51:40.988]  This is literally the antidote to these vampires.
[02:51:40.988 --> 02:51:46.076]  Everyone must go to therealanthonyfaucimovie.com and they can get it for free.
[02:51:46.076 --> 02:51:46.757]  That is incredible.
[02:51:50.248 --> 02:51:56.495]  Yeah, this I think is the only way to get a film like this out there.
[02:51:56.495 --> 02:52:00.919]  We joked with Steve Bannon, what film festival is this going to be at?
[02:52:00.919 --> 02:52:03.682]  And obviously it's not going to be at any film festival.
[02:52:03.682 --> 02:52:08.648]  Amazon, like I said, won't let us carry it in any format, even a thumb drive.
[02:52:10.409 --> 02:52:19.256]  Even in trying to do public screenings, these are so difficult to do because they'll have protesters show up that sometimes outnumber the people that are trying.
[02:52:19.256 --> 02:52:24.641]  Well, that's because if this comes out, they all go to prison and the nightmare stops of Hitler 2.0.
[02:52:24.641 --> 02:52:25.281]  Wow.
[02:52:25.281 --> 02:52:28.064]  Well, I'm so honored, Jeff Hays, to be associated with you.
[02:52:28.064 --> 02:52:31.467]  Your film is obviously incredibly powerful.
[02:52:31.467 --> 02:52:31.767]  Wow.
[02:52:33.688 --> 02:52:37.569]  Tony Lyons, you've been around for decades, interviewed you for 20 years.
[02:52:37.569 --> 02:52:39.329]  You're the top independent publisher in the country.
[02:52:39.329 --> 02:52:44.231]  You've got to feel really proud at a bone level, a gut level right now, what you're involved in.
[02:52:44.231 --> 02:52:45.171]  I mean, I'm serious.
[02:52:45.171 --> 02:52:56.854]  I don't care about basketball stars, football stars, movie stars, but let me tell you, when I see somebody like Jeff or like you or like JFK, RFK Jr., it just, you guys are kicking ass, man.
[02:52:56.854 --> 02:52:58.534]  Thank you so much for what you're doing.
[02:52:59.935 --> 02:53:04.400]  Yeah, I am so proud to be working with Jeff Hayes and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:53:04.400 --> 02:53:06.222]  to get this story out.
[02:53:06.222 --> 02:53:12.608]  I mean, people have to recognize that freedom of speech is the most important freedom in this country.
[02:53:12.608 --> 02:53:15.792]  You have to be able to question authority.
[02:53:15.792 --> 02:53:22.439]  And the things that have gone on in this country over the last couple of years have been so incredibly wrong.
[02:53:23.079 --> 02:53:28.742]  And they've impinged on every freedom we've had, and we need to strike back.
[02:53:28.742 --> 02:53:37.467]  People need to watch this movie, have their eyes open, waken up to what's happening, and share it as much as they can.
[02:53:37.467 --> 02:53:43.070]  The real Anthony Fauci movie, available at therealanthonyfaucimovie.com.
[02:53:43.070 --> 02:53:48.313]  It's the most important movie you will see this year.
[02:53:48.313 --> 02:53:51.595]  Well, I'm just impressed with what you guys have done, and
[02:53:52.594 --> 02:53:56.296]  What a great patriot Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
[02:53:56.296 --> 02:53:56.496]  is.
[02:53:56.496 --> 02:54:02.819]  His uncle was great, his father was amazing, and killed by the Deep State, and now there's the son continuing to fight on.
[02:54:02.819 --> 02:54:04.159]  This is such important work.
[02:54:04.159 --> 02:54:05.120]  Wow.
[02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:07.341]  Well, gentlemen, I salute you and I thank you.
[02:54:07.341 --> 02:54:08.741]  When is it available for sale?
[02:54:08.741 --> 02:54:10.482]  Because we're not communists here.
[02:54:10.482 --> 02:54:12.103]  We realize it takes money to fight.
[02:54:12.103 --> 02:54:13.944]  How do people support what you've done, Jeff Hays?
[02:54:15.051 --> 02:54:20.874]  They can watch it for free, and if they find it valuable, they can buy it on the page.
[02:54:20.874 --> 02:54:24.655]  But nobody has to pay to see it for the next 10 days.
[02:54:24.655 --> 02:54:30.778]  But they're welcome to, and literally we already have tens of thousands of people that have bought it.
[02:54:30.778 --> 02:54:33.919]  So this is going to be fine.
[02:54:33.919 --> 02:54:36.941]  I was losing sleep as I was moving toward this.
[02:54:36.941 --> 02:54:39.942]  This was a significant budget to make this film.
[02:54:40.582 --> 02:54:51.571]  And I financed it internally through my own company, and it was a gutsy move, and already in the first day, we're going to be fine.
[02:54:51.571 --> 02:54:52.051]  Exactly.
[02:54:52.051 --> 02:54:54.493]  We commit, God comes through to the people.
[02:54:54.493 --> 02:54:55.634]  I got tears in my eyes.
[02:54:55.634 --> 02:54:56.795]  Jeff Hays, thank you so much.
[02:54:56.795 --> 02:54:57.875]  I love you for what you've done.
[02:54:57.875 --> 02:55:00.818]  And also Tony Lyons, thank you Tony for all you've done.
[02:55:00.818 --> 02:55:02.899]  You do nothing but deliver victories.
[02:55:02.899 --> 02:55:05.341]  Thank you so much.
[02:55:05.341 --> 02:55:07.543]  Thank you for having us on.
[02:55:07.543 --> 02:55:08.063]  All right, folks.
[02:55:13.971 --> 02:55:19.776]  We have paid a lot for this, to be able to do this to these people right now.
[02:55:19.776 --> 02:55:23.699]  And I didn't wage this war against these people because I think we're gonna lose.
[02:55:23.699 --> 02:55:26.822]  I know you're kick-ass people.
[02:55:26.822 --> 02:55:32.066]  No matter what color your frickin' skin is, I want you to know I believe in your soul, and I believe in you.
[02:55:32.066 --> 02:55:34.208]  And I didn't do anything last hour, but I gotta say it right now.
[02:55:35.401 --> 02:55:45.524]  We're a platform that the enemy knows, on average, is the most devastating weapon against them there is, and that all glory goes to God, and the thanks goes to you, the listeners and the crew.
[02:55:45.524 --> 02:55:49.686]  I'm just a willing vessel to do this, but I need your support, and I need your financial support.
[02:55:49.686 --> 02:55:53.287]  So please, go to InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:56:06.792 --> 02:56:10.793]  DNA Force Plus is incredible.
[02:56:10.793 --> 02:56:13.815]  They're all there and that's how we stay on air.
[02:56:13.815 --> 02:56:19.697]  And I watch these monsters battle around the clock to silence us.
[02:56:19.697 --> 02:56:23.119]  And it's only you, the viewers and the listeners,
[02:56:24.929 --> 02:56:29.710]  The key bus, a position to be able to resist these people.
[02:56:29.710 --> 02:56:32.731]  And so that's why I'm so thankful and so humbled by you.
[02:56:32.731 --> 02:56:40.754]  And from the bottom of my heart and from the bottom of my family's heart, we are so close to victory and they're going to release this new mousepox.
[02:56:41.698 --> 02:56:51.687]  They're going to release, I mean, if these people are committing crimes that are so insane out in the open, and they think everybody's going to bow, everybody's a coward, everybody's stupid, everybody's weak.
[02:56:51.687 --> 02:56:53.129]  And I don't think that.
[02:56:53.129 --> 02:56:54.950]  I don't think you're weak.
[02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:55.871]  I don't think you're dumb.
[02:56:55.871 --> 02:56:57.553]  I don't think you want to roll over and die.
[02:56:57.553 --> 02:57:01.677]  I think, and I know, you've been asleep.
[02:57:01.677 --> 02:57:02.297]  Well, guess what?
[02:57:02.297 --> 02:57:04.159]  The sleeper must awaken.
[02:57:04.159 --> 02:57:04.880]  And that's my job.
[02:57:09.352 --> 02:57:12.773]  I just thank you from the bottom of my heart for your support and all you've done.
[02:57:12.773 --> 02:57:23.158]  And I want to encourage you again to take the action to financially support while getting great products at the same time and form that relationship with us right now and make that decision at infowarestore.com.

[02:57:38.874 --> 02:57:41.315]  And the enemy's so mad, you're putting up a fight.
[02:57:41.315 --> 02:57:43.296]  But we are putting up a fight together.
[02:57:43.296 --> 02:57:47.777]  And the fight lives here.
[02:57:47.777 --> 02:57:52.299]  I am extremely honored to be seen by the globalists as their number one enemy.
[02:57:53.847 --> 02:57:56.964]  I am blessed to know that our information is so hardcore.
[02:57:58.046 --> 02:58:02.970]  The enemies of humanity are obsessed with silencing us.
[02:58:02.970 --> 02:58:06.492]  They know the truth about their globalist operations is exposed.
[02:58:06.492 --> 02:58:07.353]  It's game over.
[02:58:07.353 --> 02:58:13.057]  And all over the planet, humanity is awakening and peacefully fighting back.
[02:58:13.057 --> 02:58:17.640]  And our main tool is free speech and the truth we promote using free speech.
[02:58:17.640 --> 02:58:23.805]  That's why when you share articles and videos from Man.Video or Infowars.com or Newswars.com, it changes the world.

[02:58:47.634 --> 02:58:51.138]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[02:58:51.138 --> 02:58:54.262]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[02:58:54.262 --> 02:58:55.022]  Now, I knew that.
[02:58:55.865 --> 02:59:00.107]  And for 28 years, I've been on air exposing these people, and together we've had a great effect.
[02:59:00.107 --> 02:59:02.608]  But listen, they're coming after us right now.

[02:59:49.099 --> 03:00:03.284]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:03.284 --> 03:00:04.685]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:24.196 --> 03:00:26.538]  So, they say you know a man by his enemies.
[03:00:26.538 --> 03:00:30.822]  And you know a man by his friends.
[03:00:30.822 --> 03:00:32.643]  And we knew Bloomberg was involved.
[03:00:32.643 --> 03:00:34.745]  We knew Soros was involved.
[03:00:34.745 --> 03:00:37.267]  We know the establishment was involved.
[03:00:37.267 --> 03:00:39.068]  Trying to shut us down.
[03:00:39.068 --> 03:00:40.610]  Making up stuff about Sandy Hook.
[03:00:40.610 --> 03:00:41.671]  Lying about us.
[03:00:41.671 --> 03:00:47.455]  Making up this huge issue on every news channel, every TV station for four years.
[03:00:47.455 --> 03:00:50.318]  So they could try to drive the stake of the heart of the First Amendment.
[03:00:51.960 --> 03:01:02.103]  But now PRWeek.com reports Berlin Rosen, which is fun about Bloomberg, comms strategy behind Sandy Hook Family's victory over Alex Jones.
[03:01:02.103 --> 03:01:06.604]  They admit it was all a giant PR operation.
[03:01:06.604 --> 03:01:16.367]  Berlin Rosen secures investment from equity firm O2 Investment about Berlin Rosen and how they ran the Alex Jones attack and the PR.
[03:01:17.930 --> 03:01:19.471]  We already knew Bloomberg funded it.
[03:01:19.471 --> 03:01:20.651]  We already knew that was happening.
[03:01:20.651 --> 03:01:23.172]  But they made San Diego a big deal.
[03:01:23.172 --> 03:01:28.294]  They made it a huge fundraiser issue for themselves by attaching it to me for a few comments I made.
[03:01:28.294 --> 03:01:32.616]  Then they had the judge find me guilty and have the jury decide how guilty.
[03:01:32.616 --> 03:01:36.637]  And they think now I just go, oh, I'm rolling over now.
[03:01:36.637 --> 03:01:38.078]  You said I'm guilty.
[03:01:38.078 --> 03:01:38.998]  I'm going away.
[03:01:40.731 --> 03:01:43.754]  The opposite is now happening.
[03:01:43.754 --> 03:01:48.919]  We are igniting the fires of liberty, and we are going to the next level.
[03:01:48.919 --> 03:01:52.783]  And we are not backing down one-tenth of one percent.
[03:01:54.548 --> 03:01:58.870]  We're going to intensify everything we've been doing thanks to your support and your prayers.
[03:01:58.870 --> 03:02:02.972]  And the number one thing I ask listeners and viewers to do, and I mean this, is prayer.
[03:02:02.972 --> 03:02:03.912]  Pray for InfoWars.
[03:02:03.912 --> 03:02:05.153]  Pray for discernment.
[03:02:05.153 --> 03:02:06.833]  Pray for Providence.
[03:02:06.833 --> 03:02:11.175]  And pray for our victory collectively together against this evil.
[03:02:11.175 --> 03:02:13.796]  And realize we have a strategy to defeat the enemy.
[03:02:13.796 --> 03:02:15.057]  The enemy is failing on every front.
[03:02:15.819 --> 03:02:21.462]  And they may have their whole corporate media and their dinosaur media, but the public doesn't believe what they say.
[03:02:21.462 --> 03:02:23.103]  Yeah, they can rig a court case.
[03:02:23.103 --> 03:02:24.784]  Yeah, they can rig whatever they want.
[03:02:24.784 --> 03:02:32.449]  But at the end of the day, as long as we keep persevering, the New World Order will fail.
[03:02:32.449 --> 03:02:33.950]  And that's what this comes down to.
[03:02:33.950 --> 03:02:35.391]  They want to make you hopeless.
[03:02:35.391 --> 03:02:40.134]  They want to make you think you're defeated because you've got a broken car or don't have money for bills.
[03:02:40.134 --> 03:02:41.374]  You were made by God.
[03:02:41.374 --> 03:02:42.055]  You're beautiful.
[03:02:42.927 --> 03:02:48.291]  No matter whether your skin's black or brown or pink or white or speckled, it doesn't matter.
[03:02:48.291 --> 03:02:57.477]  God made you and the fact that you love God and the fact that you love justice is that eternal connection and is the real value of who you are.
[03:02:57.477 --> 03:03:00.119]  You see the beauty of a sunset or a thunderstorm.
[03:03:01.070 --> 03:03:04.114]  Or of your husband or your wife or your children.
[03:03:04.114 --> 03:03:06.957]  And you care about people and you want to be a good person.
[03:03:06.957 --> 03:03:08.219]  And you want to be constructive.
[03:03:08.219 --> 03:03:09.881]  That's a beautiful thing.
[03:03:09.881 --> 03:03:11.663]  And the left is anti-human.
[03:03:11.663 --> 03:03:12.764]  Wants to abort our babies.
[03:03:12.764 --> 03:03:14.346]  Wants to have drag queen story time.
[03:03:14.346 --> 03:03:15.608]  Wants to sexualize who we are.
[03:03:15.608 --> 03:03:17.690]  Wants to destroy our innocence.
[03:03:17.690 --> 03:03:19.032]  And they have failed.
[03:03:20.879 --> 03:03:29.867]  The world is in the process of being taken away from these monsters and their theater and their propaganda and their disinformation.
[03:03:29.867 --> 03:03:39.054]  And so that's where we stand together in history, not perfect, but loving God and trying to build a better world.
[03:03:39.054 --> 03:03:44.179]  And that separates us from these parasites that know human psychology, but use it against the people.
[03:03:44.938 --> 03:03:53.582]  We know the psychology they use and try to show people the trick that's being used to get them to stand up on their own and not be controllable.
[03:03:53.582 --> 03:04:00.945]  And that, my friends, separates all of us from either God or the devil.
[03:04:00.945 --> 03:04:03.506]  And you're going to have to decide which side you're on.
[03:04:03.506 --> 03:04:06.667]  Kate Dowling, great syndicated talk show host, is about to take over.
[03:04:06.667 --> 03:04:07.527]  She's always amazing.
[03:04:07.527 --> 03:04:09.168]  And then in 55 minutes, the great Owen
[03:04:12.765 --> 03:04:14.606]  Cut the Destroyer.
[03:04:14.606 --> 03:04:17.166]  We'll be taking over 3 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:17.166 --> 03:04:21.688]  And then I've been in long wars despite the fact there's 20 days to the midterms.
[03:04:21.688 --> 03:04:23.288]  I need to go into dry dock.
[03:04:23.288 --> 03:04:25.049]  I need to go ahead and settle down.
[03:04:25.049 --> 03:04:27.449]  Take a few days off, but I'll be back soon.
[03:04:27.449 --> 03:04:29.290]  But I'm gonna sign off now.
[03:04:29.290 --> 03:04:30.970]  To the foreseeable future.
[03:04:30.970 --> 03:04:35.511]  And I thank you all for keeping me in the attack, in the fight.
[03:04:35.511 --> 03:04:40.673]  All of our success, which is epic, goes directly to you.
[03:04:42.478 --> 03:04:48.584]  I know you don't want the credit, but you need to know it's you that have supported Liberty that allowed us to do this together.
[03:04:48.584 --> 03:04:51.768]  So for that, I salute you and thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[03:04:51.768 --> 03:04:53.169]  God bless and good luck.
[03:05:00.286 --> 03:05:10.914]  X3, it stands for tri-ionine, are all three types of ionine that the body needs to be healthy and survive and thrive.
[03:05:10.914 --> 03:05:15.298]  It boosts your libido, your energy, your stamina, your immune system.
[03:05:15.298 --> 03:05:18.700]  X3 is the ultimate ionine product on the market.
[03:05:18.700 --> 03:05:24.565]  It's back in stock at InfoWarshaw.com for 50% off and it funds the InfoWar.
[03:05:25.570 --> 03:05:27.651]  So many of you are on the fence.
[03:05:27.651 --> 03:05:29.052]  You know our information is powerful.
[03:05:29.052 --> 03:05:30.333]  You know it's changed the world.

[03:05:41.399 --> 03:05:43.420]  It takes about two weeks to kick in.
[03:05:43.420 --> 03:05:45.401]  An Aspirin kicks in in 30 minutes.
[03:05:45.401 --> 03:05:46.982]  Tylenol kicks in in 30 minutes.
[03:05:46.982 --> 03:05:49.703]  This kicks in in about two weeks on average.
[03:05:49.703 --> 03:05:51.484]  You need to experience it.
[03:05:51.484 --> 03:05:51.985]  Don't wait.
[03:05:52.785 --> 03:05:53.906]  You'll be impressed.
[03:05:53.906 --> 03:05:55.486]  Infowarstore.com.
[03:05:55.486 --> 03:06:02.089]  X3.
[03:06:02.089 --> 03:06:04.130]  Hi, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:06:04.130 --> 03:06:08.552]  So happy to be here on Kate Daly, your guest host from katedalyradio.com.
[03:06:08.552 --> 03:06:10.933]  You know, big headline today.
[03:06:10.933 --> 03:06:12.214]  Not the biggest one.
[03:06:12.214 --> 03:06:13.875]  Cockatoos are getting smarter.
[03:06:13.875 --> 03:06:15.295]  Should humans be worried?
[03:06:15.295 --> 03:06:16.916]  Wall Street Journal actually put that out.
[03:06:17.376 --> 03:06:22.359]  I'm going to have to say yes, it wouldn't take much to be smarter than the average American.
[03:06:22.359 --> 03:06:25.320]  A slug is smarter than the average American right now.
[03:06:25.320 --> 03:06:35.386]  The midterms, I just wanted to say real quick before I bring on my amazing guest, Dr. Lee Merritt, I just wanted to say they keep spinning the midterms as razor thin.
[03:06:35.386 --> 03:06:37.747]  It's mathematically impossible in America.
[03:06:38.325 --> 03:06:42.647]  The conservatives have still the majority in America, so I don't believe it for a moment.
[03:06:42.647 --> 03:06:47.069]  But they're trying to do that so they can gauge up the election fraud.
[03:06:47.069 --> 03:06:50.130]  So that you'll believe it, because you'll think it's razor thin!
[03:06:50.130 --> 03:06:55.092]  Just like McMuffin, Breakfast Sandwich, we call him, and he's running against Mike Lee.
[03:06:55.092 --> 03:06:56.693]  It's not a tight race.
[03:06:56.693 --> 03:07:00.935]  Mike Lee will take it, of course, and McMuffin is a liar.
[03:07:00.935 --> 03:07:07.698]  He's always been a liar, always will be a liar, doesn't even know what he stands for, and he's supported by so many leftist groups that it's just
[03:07:08.311 --> 03:07:09.212]  It's pathetic.
[03:07:09.212 --> 03:07:10.854]  And so he's a scumbag.
[03:07:10.854 --> 03:07:11.775]  What can you say?
[03:07:11.775 --> 03:07:20.224]  So, you know, I would definitely not believe that the midterms are razor thin and start calling the media on this because we know they're not.
[03:07:21.070 --> 03:07:23.732]  Look, I've got the most amazing guest, of course.
[03:07:23.732 --> 03:07:25.113]  I love Dr. Lee Merritt.
[03:07:25.113 --> 03:07:28.495]  I love to bring her on because, let me just tell you, she's a fountain of knowledge.
[03:07:28.495 --> 03:07:30.696]  Every time I bring her on, I'm learning something new.
[03:07:30.696 --> 03:07:35.900]  I know you guys must be learning something from her and usually a volume of things.
[03:07:35.900 --> 03:07:47.848]  Dr. Merritt has been in private practice of orthopedic and spine surgery since 1995 and is the past president of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons and is a lifelong advocate of free market
[03:07:48.768 --> 03:07:50.490]  Patient-Centered Medicine.
[03:07:50.490 --> 03:07:57.254]  She actually had the opportunity a long time ago to go on the John Stossel Show and fight Obamacare and I'm so glad she did that.
[03:07:57.254 --> 03:08:05.399]  And of course her recent, check out her recent YouTube on Doctors for Disaster Preparedness, SARS-CoV-2 and the Rise of Medical Technocracy.
[03:08:05.399 --> 03:08:06.520]  It's fantastic.
[03:08:06.520 --> 03:08:09.122]  And then also TheMedicalRebel.com.
[03:08:09.122 --> 03:08:11.123]  TheMedicalRebel.com.
[03:08:11.123 --> 03:08:13.304]  You can go there and join her sub stack.
[03:08:13.304 --> 03:08:15.346]  She reveals so much on her sub stack.
[03:08:16.186 --> 03:08:21.727]  Dr. Merritt, so glad to have you with us because I cannot wait to pick your brain today.
[03:08:21.727 --> 03:08:22.947]  How are you?
[03:08:22.947 --> 03:08:23.588]  Oh, great.
[03:08:23.588 --> 03:08:24.688]  Nice to see you, Kate.
[03:08:24.688 --> 03:08:25.748]  This is great.
[03:08:25.748 --> 03:08:30.529]  I have to warn your listeners, I was demonetized from Substack.
[03:08:30.529 --> 03:08:37.150]  I'm the only person I know who was, so I've moved it onto my website, themedicalrebel.com, so you can find it there.
[03:08:37.150 --> 03:08:41.131]  Yeah, you just go up and you can, when you click in, you can find all the stuff
[03:08:42.671 --> 03:08:44.512]  They're doing this to everybody.
[03:08:44.512 --> 03:08:50.076]  I mean, the outrage we should be having at all of this censorship is insane.
[03:08:50.076 --> 03:08:52.038]  I just can't believe it.
[03:08:52.038 --> 03:08:53.779]  I think we're deer in a headlight, right?
[03:08:53.779 --> 03:08:57.242]  It feels that way still.
[03:08:57.242 --> 03:08:59.864]  I think that they're desperate.
[03:08:59.864 --> 03:09:02.906]  Because I think we're smarter than they thought we were.
[03:09:04.526 --> 03:09:07.968]  I think actually human beings are actually going to take this back.
[03:09:07.968 --> 03:09:08.769]  Humanity first.
[03:09:08.769 --> 03:09:18.736]  I think we are actually smarter than they gave us credit for and we're figuring a lot of stuff out and you know and so that's why there's a lot of fear mongering.
[03:09:18.736 --> 03:09:23.799]  I mean this idea of nuclear weapons I shared you that sub stack I did that talked about
[03:09:24.299 --> 03:09:29.360]  Why are you not going to be doing nuclear weapons, essentially, in a world where you have scalar weapons?
[03:09:29.360 --> 03:09:44.564]  You know, Putin's not going to... I said to my car dealer, who's a friend of mine, I said, you know, if Putin throws a nuclear weapon out there, I'm going to eat my sports car, piece by piece.
[03:09:44.564 --> 03:09:46.245]  I bet you there's zero chance of that.
[03:09:47.645 --> 03:09:48.545]  We could do it.
[03:09:48.545 --> 03:09:53.847]  Unfortunately, NATO might throw a nuclear weapon out there to make him the guilty to try and blame it.
[03:09:53.847 --> 03:10:00.949]  The only person that would throw out a nuke right now is somebody that wants to make a false flag against somebody else, wants to blame somebody else.
[03:10:00.949 --> 03:10:03.910]  This is just a lot of fear nonsense.
[03:10:03.910 --> 03:10:09.272]  You know, the coronavirus or the SARS-CoV-2 that's now 80% fatal.
[03:10:09.272 --> 03:10:10.292]  Don't buy into this.
[03:10:10.292 --> 03:10:12.593]  Don't get a monkey pox.
[03:10:12.593 --> 03:10:13.413]  You know, they just can't.
[03:10:13.413 --> 03:10:15.514]  They keep coming up with more stuff all the time.
[03:10:16.247 --> 03:10:18.109]  Oh, they're bringing back the variants.
[03:10:18.109 --> 03:10:25.537]  I mean, I used to tell people when Moronic came into view, I said, go to the hospital and test for Delta just to see their face drop.
[03:10:25.537 --> 03:10:26.958]  They won't know what to do.
[03:10:26.958 --> 03:10:29.320]  And now they're bringing back these variants.
[03:10:29.320 --> 03:10:31.462]  And I think you must just be laughing.
[03:10:31.462 --> 03:10:33.384]  I mean, this is absolutely ridiculous.
[03:10:33.384 --> 03:10:35.547]  A variant that strikes the world for a month.
[03:10:35.547 --> 03:10:35.847]  I mean, what?
[03:10:37.555 --> 03:10:38.316]  I don't know.
[03:10:38.316 --> 03:10:42.600]  We're less than a cockatoo, for sure.
[03:10:42.600 --> 03:10:44.783]  Maybe a slug at this point.
[03:10:44.783 --> 03:10:48.186]  I don't think a lot of people are believing it.
[03:10:48.186 --> 03:10:56.435]  The other thing is, and this again, people want to say this is all conspiracy theory, which is why on my website I had that point about how you get your news.
[03:10:56.895 --> 03:11:00.859]  You know, sheep just sit back and listen to CNN or something.
[03:11:00.859 --> 03:11:03.082]  Wolves go search the news, okay?
[03:11:03.082 --> 03:11:08.548]  And I know you are awesome at doing that sort of thing.
[03:11:08.548 --> 03:11:14.053]  If you really look around at the world, it is true there are islands off Antarctica that are named Delta and Omicron.
[03:11:14.053 --> 03:11:15.355]  They're owned by the Rothschilds.
[03:11:16.502 --> 03:11:18.564]  Go look it up!
[03:11:18.564 --> 03:11:20.385]  They love symbols.
[03:11:20.385 --> 03:11:31.453]  My point is that this is all symbolic and fear-mongering and everything they do is to divide us and to keep us afraid and keep us separated.
[03:11:31.453 --> 03:11:37.258]  If there's an answer here, it's do not be separated from your fellow man and do not be afraid.
[03:11:37.258 --> 03:11:40.420]  Go forth and prosper and fight the good fight.
[03:11:41.661 --> 03:11:42.382]  Love this.
[03:11:42.382 --> 03:11:43.584]  Love this.
[03:11:43.584 --> 03:11:45.085]  So there's so much news.
[03:11:45.085 --> 03:11:55.799]  I think people are getting a little strangled by all of the news coming out about vaccines and all of the dangers, the deaths, the sudden adult death syndrome and all of this.
[03:11:55.799 --> 03:12:00.645]  And I just wanted you to comment on this because one of the big headlines was the court ordered the CDC, of course,
[03:12:01.365 --> 03:12:06.666]  Dell did a great job on this, to release the data indicating 18 million vaccine injuries in America.
[03:12:06.666 --> 03:12:10.908]  And so they're finally having to release this by a court order because they refused to.
[03:12:10.908 --> 03:12:12.508]  That should tell people volumes.
[03:12:12.508 --> 03:12:16.649]  But just the latest, what is your perspective on the latest coming out?
[03:12:16.649 --> 03:12:19.270]  Okay, well it's grim.
[03:12:19.270 --> 03:12:22.070]  I mean the numbers are grim and what we've been seeing is grim.
[03:12:22.070 --> 03:12:24.731]  All the sudden deaths and the people dropping over.
[03:12:25.661 --> 03:12:34.265]  And I'd like to, maybe after the break, I'll talk about the soccer numbers I have about soccer players and deaths, because I did a little research on that.
[03:12:34.265 --> 03:12:36.746]  But here's the point I'm going to say first of all.
[03:12:37.509 --> 03:12:53.876]  If you're listening to this and you've been vaccinated, they've been steering the conversation away from anything other than mRNA and they've made it sound like you can't do it, we can't do anything about your vaccine injuries because it's all mRNA.
[03:12:53.876 --> 03:12:57.878]  It got into your DNA and you're just you're just hosed and we don't know what to do.
[03:12:57.878 --> 03:12:58.958]  That is not true.
[03:12:58.958 --> 03:13:00.439]  Again, I think that is another
[03:13:01.320 --> 03:13:19.001]  Of this fear tactics and I think that now through a combination of data from Celeste Solem and Karen Kingston what she just came out with and and Brian artists and so many people we are finding things that we can do something about and I think we can take care I think we can probably do a lot of because
[03:13:19.699 --> 03:13:22.260]  We're not finding mRNA in these vaccines.
[03:13:22.260 --> 03:13:33.947]  After it's all said and done, there are 18 labs out there that are studying these vaccines from Sinovac to the Sputnik to AstraZeneca, Moderna, and what they are not finding is mRNA.
[03:13:33.947 --> 03:13:43.071]  Now, when I said that to Karen Kingston a month or so ago, I remember she said something like, well, maybe it's because the mRNA goes away.
[03:13:43.071 --> 03:13:48.054]  It just dissipates if it isn't kept in cold for, you know, after 10 weeks coming out of the cold storage.
[03:13:49.111 --> 03:13:53.013]  I'm kind of, and I told her, I just, you know, I'm kind of raising my hand.
[03:13:53.013 --> 03:13:55.335]  I said, you know, I'm not really buying that.
[03:13:55.335 --> 03:13:58.437]  That's like, how can we not do, do not watch CSI?
[03:13:58.437 --> 03:14:01.499]  I mean, what's all that genetic studies on the dead bodies?
[03:14:01.499 --> 03:14:03.460]  So, there are things in there.
[03:14:03.460 --> 03:14:07.182]  It's hydrogel, and that's what she's come up with, brilliant stuff she's come up with.
[03:14:07.182 --> 03:14:12.705]  So, hydrogel, reduced graphene oxide, and some metal fragment stuff.
[03:14:12.705 --> 03:14:15.067]  And I think we have a way out of this.
[03:14:15.547 --> 03:14:16.849]  It's also EMF.
[03:14:16.849 --> 03:14:18.971]  That's another real bad part of this whole thing.
[03:14:18.971 --> 03:14:24.617]  So, that's what we need to talk about is how we get ourselves out of this and then how we take our world back.
[03:14:24.617 --> 03:14:29.962]  You know, I've said for a long time, one of the ways we take our world back is changing our language.
[03:14:29.962 --> 03:14:35.728]  We have to realize we've been lied to about basic physiology and medicine probably since 1905.
[03:14:37.316 --> 03:14:39.497]  If not earlier, but certainly since then.
[03:14:39.497 --> 03:14:49.842]  The idea that we transmit disease to each other through these little animal cules that float out and make each other sick is a great anti-human agenda without proof.
[03:14:49.842 --> 03:14:50.603]  Without proof.
[03:14:50.603 --> 03:14:59.607]  We have to go back in medicine and in biology and look at how did we prove these things and if you don't know how something was proved then it isn't proved until you figure out how it was proved.
[03:15:00.829 --> 03:15:03.051]  One hundred percent, Dr. Lee Merritt.
[03:15:03.051 --> 03:15:03.632]  I'm with you.
[03:15:03.632 --> 03:15:16.983]  And when we come back, I have so many things I want to talk about with you, even about that as well, because, yes, the Rockefellers, in the absence of finding a bacteria back in 1905, actually declared this new thing called a virus.
[03:15:16.983 --> 03:15:19.725]  And it was going to be invisible and it was going to be contagious.
[03:15:19.725 --> 03:15:23.508]  And they changed history from then on by claiming that.
[03:15:23.508 --> 03:15:27.231]  And you go back to the lie and the lie is bold and fierce and it's right there.
[03:15:27.231 --> 03:15:29.573]  And I'm sorry, you can't escape the facts.
[03:15:29.913 --> 03:15:37.878]  That the Rockefellers and good old Simon Flexner lied about the whole thing because they couldn't find what they were looking for.
[03:15:37.878 --> 03:15:39.819]  You don't go and invent something.
[03:15:39.819 --> 03:15:41.159]  But there was a definite purpose to it.
[03:15:41.159 --> 03:15:43.501]  We'll be right back with Dr. Leigh Merritt.
[03:15:43.501 --> 03:15:45.402]  Go to TheMedicalRebel.com.

[03:15:50.605 --> 03:15:52.546]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:15:56.345 --> 03:15:57.906]  Look around you.
[03:15:57.906 --> 03:16:02.909]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[03:16:02.909 --> 03:16:06.811]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[03:16:06.811 --> 03:16:16.156]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I can steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[03:16:16.156 --> 03:16:21.819]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[03:16:21.819 --> 03:16:25.421]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[03:16:26.261 --> 03:16:29.366]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[03:16:29.366 --> 03:16:35.655]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[03:16:35.655 --> 03:16:36.937]  It's unsustainable.
[03:16:36.937 --> 03:16:38.179]  So please, visit.
[03:16:39.247 --> 03:16:41.228]  SaveInfoWars.com.

[03:16:49.332 --> 03:16:52.333]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[03:16:52.333 --> 03:16:53.654]  Thank you for your support.
[03:16:53.654 --> 03:16:54.754]  Wouldn't be here without you.

[03:18:09.236 --> 03:18:13.159]  Well, high-quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[03:18:13.159 --> 03:18:24.228]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells, it doesn't just give you more energy, it doesn't just boost your immune system, but it also blocks the bad halogens in the fluoride, chlorine, bromide, bromine family.
[03:18:24.688 --> 03:18:33.136]  So ladies and gentlemen, it takes about two weeks for X3 to kick in on average, taking a few drops every day, and almost everyone has dramatic results.

[03:18:56.029 --> 03:19:07.938]  We've all heard of interventions with a family member or a friend or a co-worker that's on drugs or alcohol and is in a bad place and they need family and friends to come to their aid and talk to them and get them into rehab.
[03:19:08.786 --> 03:19:11.987]  Well, it's the same thing for America and the rest of the world.
[03:19:11.987 --> 03:19:20.909]  When it comes to critical vitamins and minerals that your body must have to live, and people don't listen, and they don't supplement, it's literally an intervention.
[03:19:20.909 --> 03:19:22.890]  I lead an incredibly stressful life.
[03:19:22.890 --> 03:19:24.410]  I don't plan to miss your health.

[03:20:02.405 --> 03:20:03.689]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:20:11.343 --> 03:20:12.984]  Back there with you on the Alex Jones Show.
[03:20:12.984 --> 03:20:15.205]  I'm Kate Dally from katedallyradio.com.
[03:20:15.205 --> 03:20:17.307]  My guest, Dr. Leigh Merritt.
[03:20:17.307 --> 03:20:19.028]  I love her to pieces.
[03:20:19.028 --> 03:20:21.849]  She's so fantastic and we have so many things to talk about.
[03:20:21.849 --> 03:20:24.010]  I also wanted to mention this too.
[03:20:24.010 --> 03:20:36.998]  I interviewed Dr. Brian Artis again and he talked about if you have lost your taste and smell to try nicotine gum for three days, half a dose three times a day, like half of a piece of gum three times a day for three days.
[03:20:37.538 --> 03:20:39.539]  And you're going to get your taste and smell back.
[03:20:39.539 --> 03:20:43.341]  And I wanted to share that because I know a lot of people are struggling with some of these things.
[03:20:43.341 --> 03:20:45.782]  And it has a lot to do with the nicotine receptors.
[03:20:45.782 --> 03:20:47.703]  There's just a lot of things that we're faced with.
[03:20:47.703 --> 03:20:55.487]  And sometimes the answer, just like smokers, smokers just you didn't see them getting pneumonia or whatever was going on.
[03:20:55.487 --> 03:20:56.367]  I don't think it's COVID.
[03:20:56.367 --> 03:20:59.809]  COVID's a label, but you get the drift.
[03:20:59.809 --> 03:21:01.850]  A lot of people still struggle with taste and smell.
[03:21:01.850 --> 03:21:04.871]  And I just thought that was really fascinating and kind of interesting.
[03:21:04.871 --> 03:21:05.832]  So that you could do that.
[03:21:06.323 --> 03:21:12.824]  He's come up with a lot of good stuff, and I honestly think if you start getting sick, it might not be a bad idea to just try it.
[03:21:12.824 --> 03:21:19.165]  It's funny that, you know, unlike so many other things, it seems, and I wonder now about flu.
[03:21:19.165 --> 03:21:19.665]  I don't know.
[03:21:19.665 --> 03:21:20.245]  I didn't notice.
[03:21:20.245 --> 03:21:31.767]  I don't treat people with this usually, but certainly in the COVID, whatever we want to call this, the outbreak, the first round of this, people that were smokers were not very well represented.
[03:21:31.767 --> 03:21:33.287]  In fact, they didn't show up very often.
[03:21:33.287 --> 03:21:34.968]  It was mostly non-smokers.
[03:21:34.968 --> 03:21:35.728]  He's right about that.
[03:21:36.568 --> 03:21:44.233]  Yeah, he came up, that's, you know, they have the big thing about the, you know, he always gets, people always ask me, what do you think about the venom issue?
[03:21:44.233 --> 03:21:59.343]  And he and I are friends, we talk about this, and we've talked about it, and because he's the one that really got me on the parasite program, I mean the whole thinking about parasites, but he, the whole thing about the venom is, it's just not the way it happened.
[03:21:59.343 --> 03:22:03.886]  I'm not saying they don't have venom somehow in here in the vaccines, that could be possible,
[03:22:04.526 --> 03:22:07.790]  But what's against that is the clinical presentation.
[03:22:07.790 --> 03:22:16.698]  It did not, it did not, the fact that they measured it in the blood, it could be, it could be your body's producing something like that.
[03:22:16.698 --> 03:22:23.886]  It could be, but it's just not, it doesn't fit because it's dose related and the people that should have died would have been the children, the smaller body
[03:22:24.566 --> 03:22:26.227]  Wait, that isn't what happened.
[03:22:26.227 --> 03:22:29.989]  It was the obese people that died, not the little people that died.
[03:22:29.989 --> 03:22:33.130]  When you get bitten by a snake, body mass helps.
[03:22:33.130 --> 03:22:38.073]  I mean, if you're a big guy, you're less apt to die from a certain dose than the little person.
[03:22:38.073 --> 03:22:46.257]  But what is true, and I think this is already, we're seeing some of this, we're already seeing bottled waters that have graphene oxide in it.
[03:22:46.972 --> 03:22:50.334]  So my advice is do not drink bottled water.
[03:22:50.334 --> 03:22:57.117]  Just from a practical bioweapons point, it's not impossible to dose a building.
[03:22:57.117 --> 03:22:59.178]  You can certainly dose a building with a toxin.
[03:22:59.178 --> 03:23:00.298]  They've shown that.
[03:23:00.298 --> 03:23:02.679]  But dosing a city gets harder.
[03:23:02.679 --> 03:23:07.162]  It doesn't matter that there's underground connections and that it's all interconnected.
[03:23:07.162 --> 03:23:08.522]  It's just volume related.
[03:23:08.522 --> 03:23:12.384]  You can't just do this in a stealth manner in an easy way.
[03:23:12.384 --> 03:23:16.506]  Unless you're using a very, very concentrated nerve toxin.
[03:23:17.166 --> 03:23:22.430]  And then Venom doesn't quite make that, you know, VX maybe or something like that, but not this.
[03:23:22.430 --> 03:23:28.715]  So, but what is possible and easy to do for these guys would be to dose your bottled water.
[03:23:28.715 --> 03:23:32.238]  There's very little quality control in bottled water, it turns out.
[03:23:32.238 --> 03:23:38.362]  You think there is and people think, I always used to think bottled water was, you know, more preferable when I was traveling than tap water.
[03:23:38.362 --> 03:23:39.743]  Turns out that's not true.
[03:23:39.743 --> 03:23:44.787]  You know, now I just drink tap water when I'm traveling and I use my chlorine dioxide and I neutralize the fluoride.
[03:23:44.787 --> 03:23:45.548]  But, you know,
[03:23:46.208 --> 03:23:49.689]  If you have good filters, you're better off with your tap water.
[03:23:49.689 --> 03:23:51.029]  Yeah, absolutely.
[03:23:51.029 --> 03:23:57.410]  Well, and also on that gum, it was 10 minutes, half a piece, 10 minutes, three times a day for three days.
[03:23:57.410 --> 03:23:58.231]  That's what he talked about.
[03:23:58.231 --> 03:24:02.171]  But I'm excited to talk to you about cancer, about parasites.
[03:24:02.171 --> 03:24:03.372]  I mean, you have so much information.
[03:24:03.372 --> 03:24:05.252]  I don't even know where to start, Dr. Merritt.
[03:24:05.252 --> 03:24:06.832]  You have so much great information.
[03:24:06.832 --> 03:24:08.313]  You're one of the great researchers.
[03:24:08.313 --> 03:24:09.873]  People, you don't realize this.
[03:24:10.653 --> 03:24:14.214]  Dr. Merritt does her homework and then does extra homework for everybody else.
[03:24:14.214 --> 03:24:19.696]  So, I love the fact that you're hitting hard on, you know, our history with virus.
[03:24:19.696 --> 03:24:21.017]  We need to re-examine that.
[03:24:21.017 --> 03:24:23.238]  Our history with cancer, we need to re-examine that.
[03:24:23.238 --> 03:24:24.678]  The moonshot, oh my gosh.
[03:24:24.678 --> 03:24:30.560]  I mean, could anything be more pathetic that King Fraudalot's trying to do right now is the cancer moonshot.
[03:24:30.560 --> 03:24:35.062]  So, tell me some of your thoughts on cancer and virus.
[03:24:36.693 --> 03:24:51.871]  Well, yeah, and honestly, Kate, I appreciate you kind of got me started on the old archives of newspapers, which really illuminates what's been going on, not just about 1918, but it turns out also Woodstock.
[03:24:51.871 --> 03:24:53.313]  Did anybody remember?
[03:24:53.313 --> 03:24:54.054]  I was in college then.
[03:24:54.054 --> 03:24:56.797]  Does anybody remember that there was a flu pandemic during Woodstock?
[03:24:57.846 --> 03:25:02.967]  No, we just remember that all these people were grouped together at Woodstock and they didn't get sick.
[03:25:02.967 --> 03:25:03.987]  Nobody remembered it.
[03:25:03.987 --> 03:25:06.748]  When you ask people that went to Woodstock, weren't you worried about the flu?
[03:25:06.748 --> 03:25:09.108]  They say, no, not really.
[03:25:09.108 --> 03:25:09.648]  What flu?
[03:25:09.648 --> 03:25:12.729]  You know, it's like they were all young people.
[03:25:12.729 --> 03:25:18.470]  So there's been a very interesting psyop going on about these viruses for a long time.
[03:25:18.470 --> 03:25:22.831]  But the issue of parasites is really, I'll tell you how I got first
[03:25:24.378 --> 03:25:32.304]  You know, God works in funny ways and he gives you little dips of information and all different things in your life and sometimes they just come together and that's parasites for me.
[03:25:32.304 --> 03:25:43.094]  So, a year or so ago, one of my friends who's a pastor, a minister, had throat cancer and his wife found fenbendazole.org.
[03:25:43.094 --> 03:25:47.158]  It's an underlying group that treats cancer using fenbendazole.
[03:25:47.158 --> 03:25:49.520]  Now, fenbendazole, otherwise known as Panacur-C,
[03:25:50.140 --> 03:25:51.681]  Yes, absolutely.
[03:26:09.179 --> 03:26:09.660]  Why?
[03:26:09.660 --> 03:26:10.460]  What is cancer?
[03:26:10.460 --> 03:26:21.651]  See, my friend was under the impression that Penbendazole was one of these drugs that also treated cancer and treated parasites, so it was good that he got it, and he did very well, better than his cohorts in the treatment program.
[03:26:21.651 --> 03:26:24.634]  So, what's the issue?
[03:26:24.634 --> 03:26:28.358]  The issue is when we see somebody that pops up and we say they have metastases,
[03:26:28.778 --> 03:26:36.083]  We see these things on the MRI, and there are all these different blobule things on MRI, but the MRI doesn't tell you what it is.
[03:26:36.083 --> 03:26:41.326]  The MRI shows spots based on the physical properties of what you're looking at.
[03:26:41.326 --> 03:26:46.870]  So if it's got more water, if the water is moving, different things like that cause it to be bright or dark.
[03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:51.653]  Well, when we look at MRIs and we see all these spots, we just say, oh, they've got metastases.
[03:26:51.653 --> 03:26:54.895]  And then we start looking for a primary cancer somewhere, right?
[03:26:54.895 --> 03:26:55.595]  Same thing with MS.
[03:26:56.989 --> 03:27:00.572]  MS, we started, we always thought MS is this neurologic diagnosis.
[03:27:00.572 --> 03:27:07.017]  We don't completely know what causes it, but we can diagnose it on MRI because we see these bright spots in your brain and your spinal cord.
[03:27:07.017 --> 03:27:19.427]  Well, it turns out a pathologist down in Florida did a study of autopsies of MS deaths and 100% of them had parasites in the brain and spinal cord.
[03:27:19.427 --> 03:27:24.191]  So what we're seeing and calling plaques turn out to be parasite damage.
[03:27:25.169 --> 03:27:27.911]  Same thing, I think, is going on with the parasites.
[03:27:27.911 --> 03:27:42.983]  And one of the things I've noticed in this is that when I was in the military, young guys, the 20-year-olds that were your classic military personnel, if they showed up and they had a cancer, it was just a single cancer, you know, maybe a testicular cancer.
[03:27:42.983 --> 03:27:46.165]  That's an age-related thing that they have.
[03:27:46.165 --> 03:27:47.026]  Okay.
[03:27:47.026 --> 03:27:51.529]  Now, if they take this vaccine, they show up with cancer all over their body.
[03:27:51.529 --> 03:27:52.450]  Now, what is that?
[03:27:52.450 --> 03:27:53.631]  Why would this be going on?
[03:27:54.231 --> 03:28:00.053]  Well, it's because these guys are exposed to parasites, probably more than the average, because they're all over the world doing this.
[03:28:00.053 --> 03:28:08.455]  And then, we don't know completely what's in the vaccine, because they still haven't told us for these thousands of pages of redacted junk they send us.
[03:28:08.455 --> 03:28:09.996]  But what we do know is some of the effects.
[03:28:09.996 --> 03:28:14.337]  And one of the effects is, it drops out your toll-like receptors.
[03:28:14.337 --> 03:28:19.899]  It's part of your immune system that is like the Roman sentries doing vigilance on your parasites.
[03:28:19.899 --> 03:28:20.539]  So we're now
[03:28:21.099 --> 03:28:29.306]  When you take the vaccine, you drop off the sentries that alert your immune system that there are parasites that need to be walled off out there.
[03:28:29.306 --> 03:28:30.527]  That's what I think is going on.
[03:28:30.527 --> 03:28:37.212]  Much more to say, but that's how I got into thinking about parasites and how to get a protocol together to not let people die from this.
[03:28:38.550 --> 03:28:39.191]  Absolutely.
[03:28:39.191 --> 03:28:46.335]  You know, women are being told, don't go in for a breast exam if you take the shot for six months because they will find cancer.
[03:28:46.335 --> 03:28:50.958]  And they're in total denial and say, it's not really cancer, but it just looks like cancer.
[03:28:50.958 --> 03:28:51.579]  Oh, good grief.
[03:28:51.579 --> 03:28:55.521]  We'll be right back with Dr. Leigh Merritt on the Alex Jones Show, so stay with us.
[03:28:55.521 --> 03:28:56.422]  You're not going to want to miss it.
[03:28:57.191 --> 03:29:08.177]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance, American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[03:29:08.177 --> 03:29:10.078]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[03:29:10.078 --> 03:29:11.519]  That's what they want to take away.
[03:29:11.519 --> 03:29:13.040]  Your ability to speak freely.
[03:29:13.040 --> 03:29:14.740]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next?
[03:29:14.740 --> 03:29:16.021]  Or are they going to go for Steve Bannon?
[03:29:16.021 --> 03:29:17.422]  Or are they going to go for Tucker Carlson?
[03:29:17.842 --> 03:29:22.686]  I studied the globalists 30 years ago, but on air 28 years, and I knew they were planning all of this.
[03:29:22.686 --> 03:29:25.088]  And I warned the public, as the modern Paul Revere.
[03:29:25.088 --> 03:29:27.110]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[03:29:27.110 --> 03:29:34.056]  And now, because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet, honest America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to globalist agenda.
[03:29:34.676 --> 03:29:40.082]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful InfoWars has been because of your past support.

[03:29:59.380 --> 03:30:00.983]  It's the bad halogen.
[03:30:00.983 --> 03:30:04.828]  To the same family as chlorine, bromide, you name it.
[03:30:04.828 --> 03:30:06.511]  What's the good halogen?
[03:30:06.511 --> 03:30:09.214]  Ladies and gentlemen, it is iodine.

[03:32:03.484 --> 03:32:17.269]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[03:32:17.269 --> 03:32:31.335]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout to get an additional 10% off.

[03:33:02.765 --> 03:33:04.050]  It's Alex Jones!
[03:33:11.493 --> 03:33:13.033]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:13.033 --> 03:33:14.874]  My guest, Dr. Leigh Merritt.
[03:33:14.874 --> 03:33:16.175]  Happy to be with you today.
[03:33:16.175 --> 03:33:18.835]  Make sure you go get those supplements in bulk.
[03:33:18.835 --> 03:33:19.756]  Make sure you have them.
[03:33:19.756 --> 03:33:21.436]  They'll keep on the shelf, I promise.
[03:33:21.436 --> 03:33:23.357]  But get your supplements in order.
[03:33:23.357 --> 03:33:24.037]  I'm serious.
[03:33:24.037 --> 03:33:25.478]  I'd always say get your house in order.
[03:33:25.478 --> 03:33:32.980]  Get your supplements in order because the way that our medical cartel is going, I think that we'll have a lot of supplements slip away from the market.
[03:33:33.420 --> 03:33:38.489]  And get them while you can because we really need to make sure we have quite a bit handy.
[03:33:38.489 --> 03:33:46.143]  Our immune system is getting attacked and for the last 100 years they've been doing a huge, huge number on our immune system and we haven't realized it.
[03:33:46.741 --> 03:33:47.922]  I think.
[03:33:47.922 --> 03:33:58.510]  We flock to go get a vaccine so stupidly because we think that's going to save us when really and truly I think it's what's been doing the damage to us all along, especially if you go do some homework.
[03:33:58.510 --> 03:34:00.672]  The AMA is just so corrupt.
[03:34:00.672 --> 03:34:05.795]  I was just listening to a speaker say, you know, the medical cartel is 10 times more corrupt than even government.
[03:34:05.795 --> 03:34:08.738]  I mean, can you get more corrupt than Washington, D.C.? ?
[03:34:09.738 --> 03:34:14.619]  So, Dr. Merritt, I mean, there are many things, I mean, mind-blowing on the MS, by the way.
[03:34:14.619 --> 03:34:15.539]  Wow.
[03:34:15.539 --> 03:34:22.381]  There are many things like that, though, in our past that they chalked up to virus, that they chalked up to this infectious illness.
[03:34:22.381 --> 03:34:28.702]  And everybody knows, if you just take a step back, when your family members are sick, you didn't automatically get sick, did you?
[03:34:28.702 --> 03:34:34.023]  So, no one ever, we don't even look at the evidence right in front of our faces that
[03:34:34.623 --> 03:34:37.184]  These things really could not be infectious.
[03:34:37.184 --> 03:34:45.867]  It's just, it's your, it's the immune system kind of manifesting itself in the same symptoms over and over again saying, you know, you're not doing well with your immune system.
[03:34:45.867 --> 03:34:46.907]  But what are your thoughts?
[03:34:46.907 --> 03:34:48.688]  I mean, there's so many things like MS.
[03:34:49.801 --> 03:35:05.417]  Right, so when we talk about viruses, well so MS is a perfect example and I think cancer is also an example of in medicine we have this acronym WNL and it's supposed to mean within normal limits but in point of fact it often means we never looked.
[03:35:05.417 --> 03:35:10.903]  So the reason we didn't figure that out in the MS is nobody bothered to autopsy these people and look at it critically.
[03:35:11.443 --> 03:35:19.768]  They all are looking at things with this paradigm that this disease is one of those things we don't know about, so look over here, we'll just do it this way.
[03:35:19.768 --> 03:35:22.489]  This is a virus, so we look over in this box.
[03:35:22.489 --> 03:35:25.011]  We're not looking at it with an open scientific mind.
[03:35:25.011 --> 03:35:35.977]  Now, as you and I have talked about, and you've helped research too, is in 1918, they actually looked at, they did autopsies of the victims, and they actually tried to prove transmission.
[03:35:35.977 --> 03:35:39.959]  They couldn't prove transmission, and they couldn't prove what was causing the problem.
[03:35:40.619 --> 03:36:01.988]  Those autopsies were then looked at by a Chinese group in 2018, I think, and they looked at the old pathologic blocks of the influenza deaths, and they concluded using modern, quote, genetic and virologic techniques, that they still didn't know what caused the pandemic of 1918.
[03:36:01.988 --> 03:36:03.769]  And so what happened here?
[03:36:03.769 --> 03:36:07.010]  When the COVID, when this thing broke out,
[03:36:08.193 --> 03:36:25.346]  And by the way, don't you think it's kind of interesting that they, I remember them sitting around kind of showing how they were debating what to call this, and it was, they came up with COVID-19, when Richard Rothschild in 2015 patented a test for COVID-19, and it was shipped out in 2018.
[03:36:25.346 --> 03:36:33.112]  I mean, you know, and I looked into that, that's not rumor, that's actually in multiple patent libraries.
[03:36:33.112 --> 03:36:34.593]  So, in any case,
[03:36:35.228 --> 03:36:42.354]  So this is all a scam, but whatever it is, these guys, the transmission, they look...
[03:36:43.223 --> 03:36:47.184]  The Chinese looked again at the blocks and they said, we still can't figure it out.
[03:36:47.184 --> 03:36:53.565]  And our people, when they finally got tired of being told, don't do autopsies, we were told don't do autopsies.
[03:36:53.565 --> 03:36:55.325]  And there was no systematic.
[03:36:55.325 --> 03:37:09.988]  For all the billions that we give to the CDC and the FDA and NIH, all our great researchers, all our great universities, they didn't systematically do a pathologic clinical review of all the cases they diagnosed as COVID.
[03:37:11.211 --> 03:37:12.571]  Nobody wanted to know.
[03:37:12.571 --> 03:37:13.612]  They didn't want to know.
[03:37:13.612 --> 03:37:14.272]  We never looked.
[03:37:14.272 --> 03:37:15.312]  We just don't want to know.
[03:37:15.312 --> 03:37:16.552]  They didn't want us to know.
[03:37:16.552 --> 03:37:23.194]  But now, about mid-June of 2021, a paper was published by pathologists that they looked at all these.
[03:37:23.194 --> 03:37:29.156]  It was, I think, 26 papers and 360 patients roughly, something like that.
[03:37:29.156 --> 03:37:32.436]  And they looked at what they and they screened.
[03:37:32.436 --> 03:37:34.597]  There's a meta-analysis of autopsy
[03:37:36.020 --> 03:37:37.983]  And in COVID positive patients.
[03:37:37.983 --> 03:37:39.345]  And guess what they said also?
[03:37:39.345 --> 03:37:42.128]  This is a year and a half after the outbreak started.
[03:37:42.128 --> 03:37:48.156]  And they said, we still don't know in the vast majority of these cases what killed them.
[03:37:48.156 --> 03:37:49.238]  What this disease is.
[03:37:49.238 --> 03:37:50.039]  We just don't know.
[03:37:50.669 --> 03:37:51.750]  They don't have an ideology.
[03:37:51.750 --> 03:37:57.755]  So when we talk about a lot of stuff, we're talking about it at a basic unknown level.
[03:37:57.755 --> 03:38:00.657]  I mean, we don't know what we should know by now.
[03:38:00.657 --> 03:38:05.200]  So something, when you can't figure it out with all these smart people, there's something wrong around the world.
[03:38:05.200 --> 03:38:12.246]  And I'm saying what it is, it's like the magician that wiggles his right hand and the answer's in front of you, but we're not paying attention to it.
[03:38:12.246 --> 03:38:13.767]  We need to look at what's in front of you.
[03:38:13.767 --> 03:38:17.690]  And this whole thing with parasites, I got to say, first of all,
[03:38:19.403 --> 03:38:20.844]  It fits what we're seeing.
[03:38:20.844 --> 03:38:34.115]  If you really look at it, besides the military people I talked about, look at all the people that you know that had cancer that was in remission, and then suddenly they took the vaccine, so-called vaccine, and their cancer just blew out all over the place.
[03:38:37.183 --> 03:38:49.626]  It's about your immune system and using, what they've done is, part of this is, they've actually dumbed down our immune system to make us vulnerable to our own parasites.
[03:38:49.626 --> 03:38:50.807]  But it gets even worse.
[03:38:50.807 --> 03:39:03.890]  Now, when you look at what Karen Kingston just came up with, she found old stuff from Ralph Baric that Ralph Baric admitted, well, you know, yes, we did isolate this spike protein genetically and we tried to manipulate it and do this stuff, but it just didn't work very well.
[03:39:05.427 --> 03:39:06.867]  You know, so that's one fact.
[03:39:06.867 --> 03:39:16.869]  The other fact is the RNA idea, this idea that we have RNA, that this is all about RNA, whether it's in the virus or in the vaccine.
[03:39:16.869 --> 03:39:29.532]  You know, there's something wrong with that, I realized when I said the RNA therapies that we actually did get to market, but then there was only a couple, but the one that was the most promising was one about eyes.
[03:39:30.678 --> 03:39:33.781]  And it cost a million dollars a dose in 2018.
[03:39:33.781 --> 03:39:46.655]  Are you telling me that in two years time frame we now can have an mRNA vaccine for 30 billion people and then we created it the time course to make 30 billion or not 30 billion but however many doses they put out.
[03:39:46.655 --> 03:39:50.699]  A lot of billions of doses because they vaccinated people sometimes four and five times.
[03:39:51.525 --> 03:39:54.467]  All over the world, they say 70% of us are all vaccinated.
[03:39:54.467 --> 03:39:56.828]  You couldn't have produced that in the short of time.
[03:39:56.828 --> 03:39:58.930]  Just get the research and development.
[03:39:58.930 --> 03:40:01.351]  How could you produce that many vials?
[03:40:01.351 --> 03:40:03.732]  There's something wrong with that, too, and something wrong with the money.
[03:40:03.732 --> 03:40:10.256]  So if you get away from the idea this is mRNA mediated, look at what Karen Kingston just came up with.
[03:40:10.256 --> 03:40:12.198]  She said, you know, there's hydrogel.
[03:40:12.198 --> 03:40:19.342]  The three things that the 18 labs found in these vaccines of all sorts, hydrogel, graphene oxide and metals.
[03:40:20.077 --> 03:40:26.840]  Hydrogel is not just a thing that, you know, it's a polymer that's cross-linked and absorbs water.
[03:40:26.840 --> 03:40:28.381]  That's at its simplest level.
[03:40:28.381 --> 03:40:30.422]  We use hydrogel in labs.
[03:40:30.422 --> 03:40:32.363]  We use hydrogel to make contact.
[03:40:32.363 --> 03:40:34.444]  And lenses, there's lots of stuff.
[03:40:34.444 --> 03:40:40.687]  But now we have genetically engineered hydrogel that they're literally saying is a new life form.
[03:40:40.687 --> 03:40:41.687]  It can multiply.
[03:40:41.687 --> 03:40:42.768]  It can expand.
[03:40:43.528 --> 03:40:46.971]  And it can react to outside forces, including wavelengths.
[03:40:46.971 --> 03:40:53.236]  So you've got, they call it smart hydrogel, and now you've got smart genetic engineered hydrogel.
[03:40:53.236 --> 03:40:57.859]  And that is what apparently she has found data that has made the spike protein.
[03:40:57.859 --> 03:41:02.643]  The thing you're showing on that picture now that they've got you, everybody's scared about, ooh, that spike protein.
[03:41:02.643 --> 03:41:04.565]  Most of this, in fact, all of this is CGI.
[03:41:05.365 --> 03:41:11.175]  The picture that we classically see of the blue, it looks like a blue ball with all these spiky things coming out of it.
[03:41:11.175 --> 03:41:12.337]  It looks really scary.
[03:41:12.337 --> 03:41:13.659]  It sounds scary.
[03:41:13.659 --> 03:41:14.541]  That's CGI.
[03:41:14.541 --> 03:41:15.042]  It's nothing.
[03:41:15.042 --> 03:41:15.643]  It's a picture.
[03:41:15.643 --> 03:41:19.029]  It's no more real than my dryer balls that look very similar, you know?
[03:41:19.785 --> 03:41:27.310]  So, but what these are is this hydrogel, like you're seeing right there, it can conform to 5G.
[03:41:27.310 --> 03:41:31.012]  So in one conformation, it can hook into your ACE2 pathway.
[03:41:31.012 --> 03:41:32.673]  In another conformation, it doesn't.
[03:41:32.673 --> 03:41:43.400]  So they can dose us with this hydrogel, it can get into us, it acts like a synthetic parasite, and then they can turn on the 5G and create disease outbreaks wherever they want.
[03:41:43.400 --> 03:41:44.561]  I think that's what's happening.
[03:41:45.149 --> 03:41:51.734]  Now, when it comes to parasite, the other thing is, I'll have to say, remember George Carlin, the seven words you couldn't say on TV?
[03:41:51.734 --> 03:41:54.056]  Well, now you can say all of those words on TV.
[03:41:54.056 --> 03:41:56.958]  Here are the six words you can't say on TV right now.
[03:41:56.958 --> 03:42:03.722]  You can't say Nidazoxonide, Chloroquine, Hydroxychloroquine, Ivermectin, Phenbendazole, and Chlorine Dioxide.
[03:42:03.722 --> 03:42:08.446]  Those are the six anti-parasitic drugs, and they all seem to work, some better than others.
[03:42:09.281 --> 03:42:14.065]  So, honestly, that's why we all need to start treating ourselves.
[03:42:14.065 --> 03:42:22.811]  I've got a new video coming out that'll be up tonight, I hope, all about, so if anybody has questions, because I get 10 or 15 calls a day, to go over the parasite protocol.
[03:42:22.811 --> 03:42:23.992]  No, I can't do it for everybody.
[03:42:23.992 --> 03:42:24.912]  It's going to be on this video.
[03:42:26.690 --> 03:42:27.590]  I love that.
[03:42:27.590 --> 03:42:33.652]  Go to TheMedicalRebel.com because you'll see so many beneficial things for your health.
[03:42:33.652 --> 03:42:39.894]  And the newest and latest, and this is why I had Dr. Merritt on today, is because I wanted to talk about the newest, the latest, and we'll come back.
[03:42:39.894 --> 03:42:41.674]  We have more, trust me on this.
[03:42:41.674 --> 03:42:43.775]  There's so much more to discuss.
[03:42:43.775 --> 03:42:45.415]  Make sure you're getting supplements.
[03:42:45.415 --> 03:42:50.257]  I think there's such a war on supplements and they would love to get rid of supplements.
[03:42:50.257 --> 03:42:52.618]  I think that's obviously, it's been their attack for a while.
[03:42:52.618 --> 03:42:53.598]  It's still coming.
[03:42:53.598 --> 03:42:54.038]  Be right back.
[03:42:56.892 --> 03:43:02.477]  Don't let the globalist monsters and their mercenary minions be successful at silencing you.
[03:43:03.652 --> 03:43:17.438]  And the Globalist's number one mission is to silence InfoWars because they rightly see us as one of the main beacons of resistance alerting the people, not just of America, but the world to the threat of the Globalist and their censorship and tyranny.
[03:43:17.438 --> 03:43:31.505]  That's why it's so essential today, now more than ever, to share links for InfoWars.com and to also financially support InfoWars.com at the most critical time on our fight by using promo code 1776 at checkout so you get an additional 10% off.
[03:43:33.134 --> 03:43:33.995]  Think about a world without InfoWars.
[03:44:02.557 --> 03:44:12.139]  Just take a moment and sit back and think about all the incredible guests and callers and stories we've broken together, this family that is InfoWars.
[03:44:12.139 --> 03:44:28.342]  Think about how InfoWars is cited by Joe Rogan and Tucker Carlson and Bolsonaro and other foreign leaders like Nigel Farage as being the main impetus towards firing up their main base to defeat the New World Order.
[03:44:28.342 --> 03:44:31.263]  The only reason humanity is still in the fight today
[03:44:32.159 --> 03:44:38.741]  Because the viewers and listeners of this broadcast have taken action and supported this show.
[03:44:38.741 --> 03:44:40.441]  I don't take the credit.
[03:44:40.441 --> 03:44:42.142]  I give you the credit.
[03:44:42.142 --> 03:44:44.762]  And now InfoWars is facing its darkest hours.
[03:44:44.762 --> 03:44:46.363]  It isn't going to give up.
[03:44:46.363 --> 03:44:48.203]  Without your support we could be shut down.

[03:45:57.387 --> 03:45:59.668]  Look, it's not hype that InfoWars has changed the world.
[03:46:00.598 --> 03:46:05.122]  It's not hype that your support of InfoWars is the reason we were able to do this.
[03:46:05.122 --> 03:46:06.824]  So I salute you and I thank you.
[03:46:06.824 --> 03:46:10.727]  Now you know about fluoride, the bad halogen on the periodic table.
[03:46:10.727 --> 03:46:14.631]  Well, high quality iodine is the good halogen and does the opposite of fluoride.
[03:46:14.631 --> 03:46:17.373]  And when you've got it in your body, it doesn't just supercharge your cells.
[03:46:17.373 --> 03:46:18.334]  It does just give you more energy.

[03:46:58.012 --> 03:47:03.918]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:47:12.071 --> 03:47:15.312]  We're on the Alex Jones Show final segment with Dr. Leigh Merritt.
[03:47:15.312 --> 03:47:16.733]  I'm Kate Dally, your guest host.
[03:47:16.733 --> 03:47:23.315]  My website, katedallyradio.com and of course, Dr. Leigh Merritt's website, themedicalrebel.com.
[03:47:23.315 --> 03:47:29.917]  You really need to look at her website, too, because let me just tell you, there's great info on there.
[03:47:29.917 --> 03:47:38.980]  I've referred to America as Pfizer America because we have turned into a pharma nation and pharma is who backs all the politicians and buys them off.
[03:47:39.580 --> 03:47:42.061]  We have so many problems because of pharma.
[03:47:42.061 --> 03:47:58.170]  I know that people credit pharma and there are instances where pharma is credited, but I actually think had we gone with more natural processes as it was totally ousted by pharma back in the early 1900s, we would have been so much better off because we would have had all the side effects and additional drugs you have to take with pharma.
[03:47:58.710 --> 03:48:01.672]  But, you know, people die every winter.
[03:48:01.672 --> 03:48:05.034]  And talk to me about what are they dying from?
[03:48:05.034 --> 03:48:09.297]  Because a lot of people go, yeah, well, I got the flu from, you know, so-and-so.
[03:48:09.297 --> 03:48:11.839]  And so, talk to me about winter.
[03:48:11.839 --> 03:48:13.480]  Because we're just about to launch into it.
[03:48:14.318 --> 03:48:17.219]  Yeah, because flu means influenza.
[03:48:17.219 --> 03:48:18.900]  Influenza means influence.
[03:48:18.900 --> 03:48:22.341]  It doesn't mean a disease.
[03:48:22.341 --> 03:48:33.285]  We have hundreds of years of data that show that this disease would spontaneously erupt around the world simultaneously in the age of wooden ships and iron men.
[03:48:33.285 --> 03:48:37.447]  You couldn't sail that fast around the world and ships would be out alone on the
[03:48:39.148 --> 03:48:45.234]  In the middle of the ocean, like in the Napoleonic Wars, in the middle of the ocean, and they would get an influenza outbreak.
[03:48:45.234 --> 03:48:48.998]  And they had no contact with land, but the land was having it too.
[03:48:48.998 --> 03:48:53.762]  Can't explain that on an airborne little thing that comes out of our mouths, okay?
[03:48:53.762 --> 03:48:54.483]  So what's going on?
[03:48:54.483 --> 03:49:03.131]  Well, some really smart astronomers figured out it correlated perfectly with sunspot cycles and sun activity, flares and cycles.
[03:49:03.966 --> 03:49:04.766]  Ionization.
[03:49:04.766 --> 03:49:05.867]  We are electrical beings.
[03:49:05.867 --> 03:49:09.289]  When you ionize the atmosphere, problems happen.
[03:49:09.289 --> 03:49:11.250]  And this is the problem of 5G now.
[03:49:11.250 --> 03:49:16.592]  This has been the problem from the time of the 1918 pandemic and the telegram lines.
[03:49:16.592 --> 03:49:22.735]  And you know, people had telegrapher's disease from living around or working underneath the telegram lines.
[03:49:22.735 --> 03:49:26.557]  And the way that the telegram company actually solved it is interesting.
[03:49:26.557 --> 03:49:32.240]  They put a long twist in the wire so it gave off a different electromagnetic signal and didn't make them sick.
[03:49:32.240 --> 03:49:32.740]  And that's why
[03:49:33.400 --> 03:49:36.402]  Now we have an opportunity to do something similar.
[03:49:36.402 --> 03:49:38.423]  So what happens in the winter with flu?
[03:49:38.423 --> 03:49:45.327]  When we call it the flu season, and I call it the winter death season now because we can't say it's due to influenza.
[03:49:45.327 --> 03:49:48.069]  Generally, it's the most infirm people.
[03:49:48.069 --> 03:49:51.031]  You don't notice the winter death season taking your usual.
[03:49:51.031 --> 03:49:56.574]  Unlike this vaccine nightmare, we don't usually see sudden death of young healthy people.
[03:49:56.574 --> 03:50:00.977]  We see the elderly being taken out, the immune compromised, the infirm.
[03:50:01.677 --> 03:50:16.062]  Now, here's what's, and actually I credit, Larry Pilevsky clued me into this and then I read some work by a doctor, a PhD in the University of Washington on the, you can look it up yourself, it's called the exclusionary zone of water.
[03:50:16.062 --> 03:50:19.043]  Okay, so we all have toxins in the body.
[03:50:19.691 --> 03:50:20.853]  And how do we get rid of them?
[03:50:20.853 --> 03:50:27.421]  There are only certain ways we can get rid of them, but ultimately it's in our cells and we have to excrete them out of our cells and out of us.
[03:50:27.421 --> 03:50:32.747]  Either you poop it out, you vomit it out, you sweat it out, and
[03:50:35.006 --> 03:50:36.906]  And it comes out of you, but it comes out of your cells.
[03:50:36.906 --> 03:50:40.507]  Now, we've always been taught that our energy comes only from food.
[03:50:40.507 --> 03:50:44.128]  That we're not plants, we don't get energy from the sun, but that's not true.
[03:50:44.128 --> 03:50:46.649]  Every cell in our body is like a battery.
[03:50:46.649 --> 03:50:47.909]  It's got a dipole.
[03:50:47.909 --> 03:50:51.670]  It's got a more positive end and a more negative end.
[03:50:51.670 --> 03:50:53.751]  It's charged, okay?
[03:50:53.751 --> 03:50:59.132]  And to charge your battery, we actually get benefit from the infrared and near-infrared rays of the sun.
[03:50:59.132 --> 03:51:01.973]  That's what those wavelengths do for us.
[03:51:01.973 --> 03:51:03.293]  So in the summer, we don't
[03:51:03.353 --> 03:51:04.273]  Yeah, I think so.
[03:51:26.126 --> 03:51:27.868]  We go to bed later.
[03:51:27.868 --> 03:51:30.712]  We still stay up late because we have electric lights, right?
[03:51:30.712 --> 03:51:33.195]  So we're not acting like my great-grandparents.
[03:51:33.195 --> 03:51:36.599]  They didn't have electricity, so they would have gone to bed when the sun goes down.
[03:51:36.599 --> 03:51:37.280]  But we don't.
[03:51:37.280 --> 03:51:38.121]  We stay up late.
[03:51:38.121 --> 03:51:39.283]  We get ready for Christmas.
[03:51:39.283 --> 03:51:40.124]  The kids are coming home.
[03:51:40.124 --> 03:51:40.805]  We clean the house.
[03:51:40.805 --> 03:51:41.606]  We do all these things.
[03:51:42.367 --> 03:51:47.373]  But we don't have the energy input from the sun to really, really keep ourselves, our batteries charged.
[03:51:47.373 --> 03:51:54.201]  You know, we always said, you know, so and so, he did that to keep getting charged up his batteries, meaning he got some sleep or some rest and he got some food.
[03:51:54.201 --> 03:51:55.262]  That really is true.
[03:51:55.262 --> 03:51:57.365]  You know, we have batteries in us.
[03:51:57.365 --> 03:51:59.748]  So when you don't charge them up with the sun,
[03:52:00.652 --> 03:52:04.554]  Then you don't have that dipole and you can't get rid of toxins.
[03:52:04.554 --> 03:52:09.175]  And so the toxins get built up and the most vulnerable die from toxicity.
[03:52:09.175 --> 03:52:10.836]  It's essentially toxicity.
[03:52:10.836 --> 03:52:13.777]  You don't need a virus to explain this whole thing.
[03:52:13.777 --> 03:52:22.020]  And this guy in Washington actually shows how it works, how you put a negative charge, how you use the dipole in your cells to wall off a toxin.
[03:52:22.020 --> 03:52:28.302]  Now here's the other thing, as you were saying, everything they do, they've done since 1905, has been to damage us.
[03:52:28.302 --> 03:52:29.863]  What is one of the things that they've done?
[03:52:30.600 --> 03:52:36.182]  They've made it so that every time you have a fever or your kid has a fever, oh, we've got to get that fever down.
[03:52:36.182 --> 03:52:37.382]  No.
[03:52:37.382 --> 03:52:39.403]  Let's suppose, think of your cells.
[03:52:39.403 --> 03:52:40.964]  Water is not in a water form.
[03:52:40.964 --> 03:52:41.924]  It's like gelatin.
[03:52:41.924 --> 03:52:43.224]  It's a gel water.
[03:52:43.224 --> 03:52:44.985]  It's the fourth state of water, they call it.
[03:52:45.797 --> 03:52:56.769]  And so, think about if I put some, you could experiment yourself, if you had pepper and you put ground pepper and you mixed it into the gelatin when it froze and now you want to get those pieces out, how would you do it?
[03:52:56.769 --> 03:52:58.331]  Well, you'd melt the gelatin, right?
[03:52:58.331 --> 03:53:04.178]  You'd make it softer, then the pepper will rise up or sink or something and it'll come out of the gelatin.
[03:53:04.178 --> 03:53:07.081]  Your cells, when you get sick, you have a temperature
[03:53:07.936 --> 03:53:13.082]  Animals will move up a gradient to get warmer, because when they get sick, they have to get rid of this toxin.
[03:53:13.082 --> 03:53:17.467]  Their cells get warmer, the gelatin gets softer, they can expel the toxins.
[03:53:17.467 --> 03:53:26.637]  What if our medical people continue to tell us, oh take this, you know, ibuprofen, take this for the flu, take this for temperature, bring down the temperature.
[03:53:27.257 --> 03:53:27.938]  No.
[03:53:27.938 --> 03:53:33.562]  The only thing, and don't ever take a chemical to bring down the temperature, that's a double whammy to kill you.
[03:53:33.562 --> 03:53:36.524]  What you do is, if you have a temperature, you live with it.
[03:53:36.524 --> 03:53:49.634]  And if it gets too uncomfortable, if it gets up over 104 or something, then okay, sponge yourself down, or sponge your child down in a bathtub, like grandma used to do, like my mother used to do.
[03:53:49.634 --> 03:53:52.716]  They never gave me ibuprofen for a fever.
[03:53:52.716 --> 03:53:56.339]  That's not the right thing to do, but our medical people continue to do it.
[03:53:57.836 --> 03:53:59.577]  That's what kills us in the winter.
[03:53:59.577 --> 03:54:00.498]  Don't need viruses.
[03:54:00.498 --> 03:54:03.020]  It's toxins.
[03:54:03.020 --> 03:54:03.741]  Oh, I love this.
[03:54:03.741 --> 03:54:07.444]  I love it when you just explain it like this because these are the things we've been missing.
[03:54:07.444 --> 03:54:10.446]  We have not been educated on any of this.
[03:54:10.446 --> 03:54:14.349]  I think the whole vaccine program really and truly was to hurt our immune system.
[03:54:14.349 --> 03:54:14.970]  We didn't need it.
[03:54:14.970 --> 03:54:15.910]  We have good sanitation.
[03:54:15.910 --> 03:54:17.532]  You don't need it when you have good sanitation.
[03:54:18.252 --> 03:54:18.832]  I think so.
[03:54:38.223 --> 03:54:40.046]  Any doctor could have done what I did.
[03:54:40.046 --> 03:54:41.607]  Like, this is not my specialty.
[03:54:41.607 --> 03:54:43.430]  I'm an orthopedic surgeon, okay?
[03:54:43.430 --> 03:54:45.933]  But I started looking into the vaccine.
[03:54:45.933 --> 03:54:47.535]  Unfortunately, I vaccinated my children.
[03:54:47.535 --> 03:54:52.081]  I wouldn't do it again, but I vaccinated them because I was a classically trained physician, right?
[03:54:52.791 --> 03:55:03.135]  But I can remember, I should have remembered this because I remembered it later, my professor of medicine, pediatrics in medical school said vaccines didn't cure childhood diseases, plumbers did.
[03:55:03.135 --> 03:55:11.158]  And his point was just what you said, it was sanitation and nutrition that decreased death from childhood diseases.
[03:55:11.158 --> 03:55:15.360]  Now one thing everybody asks me about is, well how do your kids get chicken pox then?
[03:55:16.115 --> 03:55:24.722]  Well, I mean, there's a couple of possibilities, but what I think it is, what I think it's going to turn out to be, is the electromagnetic transmission of disease.
[03:55:24.722 --> 03:55:34.950]  You see, that is the scariest thing, is that we now know, through Luc Montagnier and Jacques Bienveniste, that water has memory and that you can capture the electromagnetic signal
[03:55:35.690 --> 03:55:39.872]  And of biomolecules and transmit them.
[03:55:39.872 --> 03:55:57.882]  Dr. Kozlochev, a Russian in the 20s and 30s, showed you can transmit disease by ultraviolet and near ultraviolet photons from dying cells that have been poisoned to unpoisoned cells that will then start to die the same way.
[03:55:57.882 --> 03:56:00.864]  He figured out, he showed this in thousands of experiments.
[03:56:01.793 --> 03:56:12.341]  And so if it's possible, these psychopaths could capture the death photons of some disease and broadcast it with 5G on all of us.
[03:56:12.341 --> 03:56:14.963]  That's how chickenpox could possibly happen.
[03:56:14.963 --> 03:56:18.866]  You know, my body, and I'm a three and a half year old, it's time to detox.
[03:56:18.866 --> 03:56:19.746]  I start detoxing.
[03:56:19.746 --> 03:56:22.969]  I get these little scabby things and little things on my rash.
[03:56:22.969 --> 03:56:28.733]  And then, but those, my cells are giving off an electromagnetic photon
[03:56:30.138 --> 03:56:38.082]  You know, consistent with chickenpox that my four-year-old friend in the room takes up and then he gets his body says, oh time to detox.
[03:56:38.082 --> 03:56:39.282]  Okay, I'll do it too.
[03:56:39.282 --> 03:56:40.683]  You know, and then they do it.
[03:56:40.683 --> 03:56:41.383]  That sounds funny.
[03:56:41.383 --> 03:56:42.724]  We talk to each other, right?
[03:56:42.724 --> 03:56:47.526]  So if bodies talk to each other, that's why women's cycles sync up when they live together.
[03:56:47.526 --> 03:56:51.388]  Bodies talk to each other and what you're saying is we have so much proof of it.
[03:56:51.388 --> 03:56:53.248]  So I love that.
[03:56:53.248 --> 03:56:54.309]  But they don't explain it.
[03:56:54.309 --> 03:56:54.829]  Yeah.
[03:56:54.829 --> 03:56:56.450]  And how do our cells talk to each other?
[03:56:57.796 --> 03:56:58.897]  Right, exactly.
[03:56:58.897 --> 03:57:00.479]  And Tesla was right.
[03:57:00.479 --> 03:57:08.327]  He said, if you want to understand the universe, this medium that you're talking about is really what kind of rules the earth.
[03:57:08.327 --> 03:57:15.816]  And he figured it out, and of course they took him out and dismissed all of his findings, or stole them, who knows.
[03:57:15.816 --> 03:57:16.817]  But Dr. Lee Merritt.
[03:57:18.761 --> 03:57:24.363]  I was going to say, Tesla also said, everything in biologic life is between 6 and 8 hertz.
[03:57:24.363 --> 03:57:29.965]  And if we understand how it all works, then we can use wavelength to control the mind.
[03:57:29.965 --> 03:57:31.065]  That's what he said too.
[03:57:31.065 --> 03:57:32.725]  So there's an evil side of this.
[03:57:32.725 --> 03:57:34.786]  Go to your website for more of this.
[03:57:34.786 --> 03:57:37.167]  Go to themedicalrebel.com.
[03:57:37.167 --> 03:57:39.608]  I'm Kate Dally from katedallyradio.com.
[03:57:39.608 --> 03:57:41.388]  So glad to be with all of you today.
[03:57:41.388 --> 03:57:44.089]  And thanks for tuning into the Alex Jones Show.
[03:57:46.727 --> 03:57:50.208]  Everybody says they want people to stand up and fight tyranny.
[03:57:50.208 --> 03:57:53.329]  But when you fight tyranny, the new world order comes after you.
[03:57:53.329 --> 03:57:54.949]  Now, I knew that.
[03:57:54.949 --> 03:57:57.770]  And for 28 years, I've been on air exposing these people.
[03:57:57.770 --> 03:57:59.191]  And together, we've had a great effect.
[03:57:59.191 --> 03:58:01.671]  But listen, they're coming after us right now.
[03:58:01.671 --> 03:58:02.832]  They're trying to shut us down.
[03:58:02.832 --> 03:58:06.493]  But they can't beat the power of we the people, of you and I together.
[03:58:06.493 --> 03:58:13.475]  So please visit Infowarshore.com and get incredible, game-changing products, while at the same time, keeping us on air.
[03:58:13.735 --> 03:58:14.356]  We're good to go.

[03:58:46.687 --> 03:58:48.267]  Look around you.
[03:58:48.267 --> 03:58:53.289]  Everything I predicted from the Globalist's own documents, from their own admissions, is now happening.
[03:58:53.289 --> 03:58:57.170]  Infowars credibility, my credibility has never been higher.
[03:58:57.170 --> 03:59:06.513]  And it's because of your backing of this operation that I could steadfastly, despite the censorship and the boycotts and the attacks and the lawsuits, stay on air.
[03:59:06.513 --> 03:59:12.175]  But now we're reaching the most critical juncture in the fight together.
[03:59:12.175 --> 03:59:15.776]  So I want to ask all of you today to help keep me on the air.
[03:59:16.616 --> 03:59:19.741]  In my decades on air, I've never asked for personal donations.
[03:59:19.741 --> 03:59:26.030]  But I'm being forced by the bankruptcy court to pay for 40% of the legal fees, and I can't fund those myself.
[03:59:26.030 --> 03:59:27.312]  It's unsustainable.
[03:59:27.312 --> 03:59:28.534]  So please, visit.

[03:59:39.708 --> 03:59:42.710]  I'll never give up, I'll never give in, but I could give out.
[03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:44.011]  Thank you for your support.
[03:59:44.011 --> 03:59:45.111]  Wouldn't be here without you.
