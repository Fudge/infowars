[02:23.040 --> 02:26.080]  ago that they had passed it out of the committee because essentially when they
[02:26.080 --> 02:32.960]  marked it up and when the democratic controlled committee they had a majority
[02:32.960 --> 02:37.680]  of five extra a super majority that it was going to go to the full senate and
[02:37.680 --> 02:46.400]  that is now now in the pike to happen though they're playing possum they're
[02:46.400 --> 02:50.800]  saying oh this we won't vote on this till next year
[02:50.800 --> 02:55.360]  which means they're going to vote on it this year and they're also saying today

[02:59.840 --> 03:04.400]  year and then today they're announcing no it's
[03:04.400 --> 03:08.560]  going to be voted on this year so they're constantly
[03:08.560 --> 03:12.080]  engaging in the military tactic of playing possum and telling you stand

[09:16.480 --> 09:20.000]  that in the final phase a bunch of mindless
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.360]  religionist and i've heard austin news the last
[09:23.360 --> 09:26.960]  few months reporting and everyone questioning why
[09:26.960 --> 09:30.400]  even small suv's are being keyed and having their tires
[09:30.400 --> 09:34.480]  slashed well out in los angeles they know what's
[09:34.480 --> 09:38.160]  happening and it's been confirmed for at least five years that environmentalist
[09:38.160 --> 09:42.160]  they're really just cult members are slashing suv's tires
[09:42.160 --> 09:50.080]  and keying them and every day that people park down anywhere at zilker park
[09:50.080 --> 09:54.080]  by barton springs or to ride the zilker zephyr
[09:54.080 --> 09:57.520]  children's train or to jog on the hike and bike trail
[09:57.520 --> 10:02.080]  every time i have parked there with my wife and children
[10:02.080 --> 10:08.000]  windows are knocked out of suv's every time i walk through the parking lot
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.200]  windows are knocked out so they're knocking windows out they're slashing
[10:11.200 --> 10:14.480]  tires they're keying the vehicles and the media
[10:14.480 --> 10:17.920]  will not report in most areas of the country what's going on well
[10:17.920 --> 10:22.320]  in fact i heard local k lbj 590 yesterday marveling at all the vandalism
[10:22.320 --> 10:25.600]  wondering who's doing it uh it's the environmentalist
[10:25.600 --> 10:30.640]  if your car gets the window knocked out or keyed or the tire slasher all three
[10:30.640 --> 10:34.800]  and it's an suv and they don't steal anything you've been hit by the cultist
[10:34.800 --> 10:40.160]  and they're out there laughing right now they've had in one night over a hundred
[10:40.160 --> 10:44.960]  cars hit in places like circle c neighborhood
[10:44.960 --> 10:49.120]  and everyone's wondering why it's happening it's the cult members
[10:49.120 --> 10:53.120]  the government's got lots of cults they've got the environmental cultist
[10:53.120 --> 10:57.520]  they've got the vaccine cultist running around trying to force everybody to
[10:57.520 --> 11:01.200]  take shots they've got their military cultists that worship whatever the
[11:01.200 --> 11:04.880]  military is doing even if it's torture and secret arrest and violating the
[11:04.880 --> 11:08.800]  bill of rights and constitution you just got a bunch of cults in this country
[11:08.800 --> 11:12.960]  got your sports cults your video game cults people that don't care about
[11:12.960 --> 11:17.200]  anything but their little cult and so if you get your tires slashed and uh
[11:17.200 --> 11:21.440]  your windows bashed out on your suv or your gas guzzler
[11:21.440 --> 11:26.080]  understand that this is the environmental cult doing
[11:26.080 --> 11:28.880]  an okay side issue i just thought i would again
[11:28.880 --> 11:33.280]  announce to everyone the mystery is not a mystery
[11:33.280 --> 11:39.440]  in fact if you go to the zilker park or any other big park in austin there is
[11:39.440 --> 11:44.240]  just glass all over the ground when you park your car
[11:44.240 --> 11:49.360]  and that is not robberies most of it is not robberies i don't have any
[11:49.360 --> 11:52.320]  statistics i just know that i've talked to the people and i've
[11:52.320 --> 11:55.520]  seen the pattern across the country they're bad in denver they're bad in
[11:55.520 --> 12:00.560]  los angeles they're bad in new york they're bad everywhere
[12:00.560 --> 12:03.840]  and they bash your windows out they slash your tires
[12:03.840 --> 12:08.240]  because you got two or three four children you need a van
[12:08.240 --> 12:12.880]  you need an suv and they're going to be running the government soon so look
[12:12.880 --> 12:16.000]  out and they're the people these college students and high school
[12:16.000 --> 12:19.200]  students bashing your windows out slitting your tires burning down your
[12:19.200 --> 12:22.400]  ski resort burning down your house oh the every
[12:22.400 --> 12:25.280]  week or two i hear about them burning down somebody's house
[12:25.280 --> 12:29.760]  houses that are being constructed they still get charged with
[12:30.960 --> 12:34.800]  very serious charges and they should because arson could kill people
[12:34.800 --> 12:38.720]  and their arson has killed people that's the real terrorist in this in this
[12:38.720 --> 12:41.680]  country are these environmentalists they're not real environmentalists
[12:41.680 --> 12:46.960]  they're cultists but i thought i would just fill you in
[12:46.960 --> 12:51.440]  all right now i'm starting to rant about it it just makes me so angry
[12:51.440 --> 12:54.400]  but the local media i guarantee you they know what's really going on but they
[12:54.400 --> 12:57.040]  wouldn't dare talk bad about the little environmentalist
[12:57.040 --> 13:01.360]  because all the big banks and all the big establishment types are busy stealing
[13:01.360 --> 13:05.440]  people's farms and ranches outside austin and all over the country
[13:05.440 --> 13:08.160]  in the name of environmentalism and then five years later when everybody
[13:08.160 --> 13:10.960]  forgets that they stole the land and they're making it a park
[13:10.960 --> 13:15.280]  they turn it into a hotel or a golf course or a housing development
[13:15.280 --> 13:20.320]  run by the very groups that have stolen the property
[13:20.320 --> 13:24.720]  global treaty could throw file sharing
[13:24.720 --> 13:30.560]  off internet after three strikes leaked details of the anti counterfeiting

[13:39.120 --> 13:42.480]  internet if they are reportedly accessing of shared copyright material
[13:42.480 --> 13:45.840]  you're guilty first there's no trial you're just shot off the web
[13:45.840 --> 13:51.920]  says media and digital rights watchdogs so we'll be going over that
[13:51.920 --> 13:55.200]  as well today
[13:56.640 --> 14:01.680]  gold prices surge as india buys imf reserves

[14:24.400 --> 14:28.720]  climate bill so we can go to the full senate

[14:42.080 --> 14:46.480]  to have us military forces that's who they're using
[14:46.480 --> 14:52.160]  and private mercenaries now confirmed declassified
[14:52.160 --> 14:56.320]  go out and just kill whoever they want in any nation pakistan italy
[14:56.320 --> 15:00.720]  germany russia the united states no judge no jury no trial
[15:00.720 --> 15:04.880]  they just kill you because hell we're america john wanes from here
[15:04.880 --> 15:08.000]  our government can't do any wrong unless it's waco or

[15:54.640 --> 15:57.440]  precedence remember cheney wanted to put troops on the
[15:57.440 --> 16:01.280]  streets for regular crimes that got declassified three months ago
[16:01.280 --> 16:05.120]  and they bragged because they wanted to use military against the states

[24:26.560 --> 24:30.240]  researcher and author daniel estalon whose info is always proven to be accurate
[24:30.240 --> 24:33.440]  best known for his expose on the ultra secret of billderberg group
[24:33.440 --> 24:37.840]  says inside sources have informed him that the core focus of the g20 meeting
[24:37.840 --> 24:41.600]  and that's a billderberg group member or attendee that he knows
[24:41.600 --> 24:46.240]  not a member an attendee a banker in europe has told him that this weekend
[24:46.240 --> 24:50.480]  will be discussing ditching the dollar and implementing a global centralized
[24:50.480 --> 24:54.640]  monetary system well their last three meetings openly
[24:54.640 --> 24:58.240]  discussed how to leave the dollar they're not discussing now
[24:58.240 --> 25:02.320]  should they abandon the dollar it's being to discuss how to abandon it
[25:02.320 --> 25:06.640]  the decision has been made a press release the tailing estalon statement
[25:06.640 --> 25:10.160]  says that g20 finance ministers and central bank governors meeting in
[25:10.160 --> 25:14.880]  st andrew scotland will debate actions to sink the us dollar thereby
[25:14.880 --> 25:19.840]  crashing the present world financial system and building it in their new
[25:19.840 --> 25:23.600]  order the instability and chaos resulting out of such a breakdown would
[25:23.600 --> 25:28.080]  act as a pretext to launch a consolidation of new economic world
[25:28.080 --> 25:32.560]  order estalon says the success or failure of the
[25:32.560 --> 25:36.800]  callous plan hinges on the ability of the us and uk representatives
[25:36.800 --> 25:39.680]  to convince the russian and chinese and their national governments
[25:39.680 --> 25:42.960]  to go along with their scheme and that's the key here
[25:42.960 --> 25:46.800]  it is goldman sacks and jp morgan chase that had up this
[25:46.800 --> 25:51.920]  this this internal crew this coterie
[25:53.440 --> 25:57.600]  the squad and they are the ones that have been
[25:57.600 --> 26:01.360]  incrementally destroying it but they don't want it to be based on chinese
[26:01.360 --> 26:04.720]  or indian money or middle eastern money they want it based on a new
[26:04.720 --> 26:09.200]  sdr strategy between the international central banks themselves
[26:09.200 --> 26:13.360]  abandoning country-backed currencies they'll still be back with taxpayer
[26:13.360 --> 26:17.760]  money but it will transfer fully from the nation states
[26:17.760 --> 26:21.680]  to the private consortium estalon first reported on this agenda
[26:21.680 --> 26:24.960]  at this year's bill deberg conference held in greece back in may according to
[26:24.960 --> 26:28.480]  the author the elite group has termed the move
[26:28.480 --> 26:32.720]  demand destruction the bill deberg group meeting is an annual confab of
[26:32.720 --> 26:36.160]  around 150 the world's most influential power brokers in government
[26:36.160 --> 26:40.640]  industry banking media academia in the military industrial complex
[26:40.640 --> 26:44.320]  insiders at the meeting told estalon that bill deberg was divided on whether to
[26:44.320 --> 26:48.960]  put into motion either a prolonged see the decision's been made just
[26:48.960 --> 26:53.600]  it's how to skin the cat either a prolonged agonizing depression that
[26:53.600 --> 26:56.160]  dooms the world the decades of stagnation
[26:56.160 --> 26:59.360]  decline in poverty or an intense but shorter depression
[26:59.360 --> 27:03.040]  that paves the way for a new sustainable economic world order with less
[27:03.040 --> 27:06.160]  sovereignty but more efficiency see that's their spin
[27:06.160 --> 27:09.360]  on it and by the way that was even in a bill deberg
[27:09.360 --> 27:12.880]  group press release they said similar things they now even put out a small
[27:12.880 --> 27:15.440]  release according to the researcher some bill deberg
[27:15.440 --> 27:18.560]  insiders fear that the fallout from the chaos of a major
[27:18.560 --> 27:23.440]  crash could ultimately result in a loss of control over the world
[27:23.440 --> 27:26.800]  and that's what they're debating is how to carry this out they but he believes
[27:26.800 --> 27:31.040]  this weekend's g20 meeting being held on the side of the 1998 bill deberg
[27:31.040 --> 27:35.680]  conference will be used to finalize this deliberation
[27:37.840 --> 27:41.040]  the motivation for collapsing the u.s. dollar would be to
[27:41.040 --> 27:45.040]  initiate a chain reaction shift away from the nation state structure of the
[27:45.040 --> 27:48.800]  global economy towards the creation of a world company
[27:48.800 --> 27:52.480]  a private global system this has been a long time agenda
[27:52.480 --> 27:55.440]  of the corporate political kingpins that make up the bill deberg
[27:55.440 --> 27:59.120]  organization elites who would profit from replacing the authority of national
[27:59.120 --> 28:02.800]  sovereignty with a ruling corporation like order
[28:02.800 --> 28:05.520]  headed by international bankers and financiers
[28:05.520 --> 28:09.280]  and then to the global carbon tax they get to decide what industry can operate
[28:09.280 --> 28:13.120]  they can give themselves sweetheart deals and sell the public carbon credits
[28:13.120 --> 28:17.920]  to be able to travel work fly in airplanes own dogs eat meat
[28:17.920 --> 28:22.320]  everything is to be taxed television sets are to be taxed or outright bans
[28:22.320 --> 28:25.840]  forts and acres introduce that bill for a 40 inch and above
[28:25.840 --> 28:29.200]  asylum was also informed by bill deberg sources back in may
[28:29.200 --> 28:33.200]  so was tuckered that a false notion of recovery would be
[28:33.200 --> 28:36.800]  proffered in order to draw back investment into the system before
[28:36.800 --> 28:40.320]  finally pulling the plug leaving the world in financial hardship
[28:40.320 --> 28:44.480]  too destructive to recover from without radical
[28:44.480 --> 28:49.280]  action taken by the globalists see they engineered last year's crisis
[28:49.280 --> 28:53.440]  in september and october saying give the banks unlimited money over 50 trillion
[28:53.440 --> 28:58.640]  now globally over 23.7 trillion in the u.s in the last year
[28:58.640 --> 29:02.880]  give them unlimited funds and unlimited power
[29:02.880 --> 29:08.640]  or there'd be a total world depression then they hoarded all the money to
[29:08.640 --> 29:12.480]  themselves as we said they would shut off the economy even further

[39:21.920 --> 39:26.320]  went up got into the cockpit pointed their guns at the captain's
[39:26.320 --> 39:34.880]  and his co-pilot put on american airlines uniforms and came back into the
[39:34.880 --> 39:38.720]  rest of the plane and started giving orders if if if everybody on the plane
[39:38.720 --> 39:41.200]  started following their orders and believing
[39:41.200 --> 39:46.160]  that not only were they just hijackers know that they are the real captains
[39:46.160 --> 39:49.840]  now because they're wearing the uniform
[39:49.840 --> 39:54.480]  and then the tied up real captain and his co-pilot get out of the bonds they're
[39:54.480 --> 39:58.080]  in get to firearms in the safes they have which a
[39:58.080 --> 40:01.600]  lot of airplanes now have thanks to people fighting for that

[41:43.360 --> 41:50.560]  it's the exact same crew of criminals there was a
[41:50.560 --> 41:53.360]  Reuters article of all publications yesterday
[41:53.360 --> 41:57.280]  admitting that every key regulator every key person in the government

[42:21.040 --> 42:25.040]  co-intel pro going against me 24-7 trying to discredit me
[42:25.040 --> 42:28.960]  in disinformation and in fighting campaigns because ladies and gentlemen
[42:28.960 --> 42:32.800]  i'll get up here and have ron paul on and ask him should we have
[42:32.800 --> 42:36.800]  grand juries indict the bankers and he will say yes and i sit here beating the
[42:36.800 --> 42:40.720]  drum to go after the real government
[42:40.720 --> 42:44.000]  they don't want you talking about goldman sacks and the private fellow reserve

[42:51.360 --> 42:55.600]  having all these factionalized groups fighting with each other over who runs
[42:55.600 --> 43:01.200]  the new world order system regardless of who runs the new world order system
[43:01.200 --> 43:04.560]  there's germans there's jews there's protestants there's catholics all the
[43:04.560 --> 43:08.880]  big power groups are working for the new world order now
[43:08.880 --> 43:12.560]  instead of fighting with each other which the globalist and it's been released
[43:12.560 --> 43:15.840]  in the media run most the white supremacist groups and other organizations
[43:15.840 --> 43:19.920]  instead of them trying to poison and taint the movement against the banks
[43:19.920 --> 43:23.840]  by making it a racial and religious issue how about we just agree whether
[43:23.840 --> 43:27.760]  you're a hindu a jew a christian a catholic
[43:27.760 --> 43:31.280]  that we're against an unelected private world government
[43:31.280 --> 43:37.680]  taxing the air we breathe and all human activities how about we just come
[43:37.680 --> 43:40.160]  together and agree that we want national sovereignty
[43:40.160 --> 43:46.000]  and abela writes in a constitution see we have to be for something not just
[43:46.000 --> 43:49.120]  against something they want us fighting with each
[43:49.120 --> 43:52.320]  other that's in the co-intel pro documents it's in the declassified
[43:52.320 --> 43:57.200]  1994 army manual on how to get groups fighting with each other

[46:20.000 --> 46:23.280]  vaccines they're spraying you with chemtrails and now admitting it
[46:23.280 --> 46:26.720]  don't you understand these people can't be bargained with
[46:26.720 --> 46:31.520]  they can't be reasoned with they are pure evil they compete with each other to
[46:31.520 --> 46:36.640]  see who's more ruthless they give each other awards they admire darkness
[46:36.640 --> 46:42.240]  they admire the power the black flame as they call it the black sun
[46:42.240 --> 46:49.600]  the black sunshine well they really get mad having those secrets let out on there
[46:53.440 --> 46:58.640]  you know what what what what ties together what binds
[46:58.640 --> 47:02.240]  the globalist whether they're german or jewish or catholic or protestant or
[47:02.240 --> 47:06.720]  hindu or japanese or chinese or mexican
[47:06.720 --> 47:10.960]  what binds them together is that they are hyper competitive
[47:10.960 --> 47:15.200]  sadistic psychopaths and twisted individuals who
[47:15.200 --> 47:19.920]  revel in pain and death and destruction and they bind themselves together
[47:19.920 --> 47:24.400]  in guilds to carry out criminal operations and they've had hundreds of
[47:24.400 --> 47:28.640]  years to amass wealth and to hone their universities of corruption and
[47:28.640 --> 47:33.360]  evil their systems are colleges of corruption
[47:33.360 --> 47:37.760]  they study our psychological systems they manipulate you
[47:37.760 --> 47:41.040]  they manipulate us all
[47:43.280 --> 47:47.760]  you are not fulfilled and you are not happy and you are not truly alive
[47:47.760 --> 47:51.280]  because you have not struck out against evil
[47:51.280 --> 47:57.280]  you have not stood up you have not become a true man a true woman you will
[47:57.280 --> 48:01.680]  not be fulfilled until you are prepared to lay your life down for others
[48:01.680 --> 48:05.280]  and not on a fake cause the new old order's greatest power is they have good
[48:05.280 --> 48:10.320]  people working for them who they manipulate and give a false
[48:10.320 --> 48:13.680]  script to psychologically and culturally and then you have all these
[48:13.680 --> 48:17.280]  good people working for evil believing the candy coating of what they're
[48:17.280 --> 48:21.360]  doing not understanding the deeper secrets
[48:21.360 --> 48:27.200]  but you scratch the surface of any new world order system you will find
[48:27.200 --> 48:31.040]  the black gulfs of hell
[48:31.040 --> 48:36.720]  because the light and goodness and love and innocence is like a burning flame
[48:36.720 --> 48:41.280]  to these people they are the title opposite of goodness
[48:41.280 --> 48:45.280]  don't you understand they're a singularity of hell
[48:45.280 --> 48:48.320]  a vortices
[48:50.880 --> 48:59.520]  evil implodes to prime pure evil it has a gravitational weight
[48:59.520 --> 49:04.960]  it immediately accelerates to pure evil the minute you give into it
[49:04.960 --> 49:11.920]  it overtakes you consumes you you are bathed in evil from sun up to sun down
[49:11.920 --> 49:16.400]  evil is real tim in australia you're on the air go ahead

[49:25.120 --> 49:29.520]  with the swine flu vaccine in my local gp um
[49:29.520 --> 49:33.440]  i went in for another problem i was basically having some abdominal pains
[49:33.440 --> 49:38.880]  and he referred me um to get an ultrasound in some blood tests
[49:38.880 --> 49:43.280]  and he said that i'll get the the way he worded he said i'll
[49:43.280 --> 49:46.800]  and i'll give you your swine flu vaccine at the same time
[49:46.800 --> 49:50.640]  it's a free vaccine that the government is pushing at the

[49:54.000 --> 49:59.120]  calmly yeah and anyway i said oh that's fine you know i i don't want the vaccine
[49:59.120 --> 50:03.040]  and i'd rather not have it and he started questioning me why
[50:03.040 --> 50:06.560]  why don't you want to sit well the main two reasons is that it's
[50:06.560 --> 50:10.560]  experimental and there's mercury in there so especially why i'm having other
[50:10.560 --> 50:15.360]  problems with my body i don't want to be taking that vaccine
[50:15.360 --> 50:19.360]  and he's sort of like oh tim you know you need to stop looking at these things on
[50:19.360 --> 50:23.120]  the internet it's safe i've taken it myself etc etc
[50:23.120 --> 50:29.520]  so that's why i'd rather not anyway i the nurse that did the blood test he

[54:18.000 --> 54:21.600]  all right tim in australia finishing up so you're telling them
[54:21.600 --> 54:26.000]  you're there getting your stomach check they're ultrasounding your kidneys
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.960]  you've gotten the part where the nurse was uh doing that examination go ahead
[54:30.960 --> 54:35.360]  the the nurse was actually doing the the blood test and she took my blood test
[54:35.360 --> 54:39.920]  and then she went and put like another syringe into the little a little vial
[54:39.920 --> 54:42.640]  and i said you know i'm only getting a blood test i'm not getting any
[54:42.640 --> 54:45.840]  injections and she said well your doctors ordered the
[54:45.840 --> 54:49.040]  the swine flu vaccine i mean this was after i'd already told him
[54:49.040 --> 54:52.400]  that i didn't want it i said well no there must be a mistake i'm not getting
[54:52.400 --> 54:55.520]  that so she's gone and she's typed something in the computer
[54:55.520 --> 54:59.840]  and basically i went on my way um i mean we have a obviously a government ran
[54:59.840 --> 55:02.560]  healthcare system in australia so it was about
[55:02.560 --> 55:06.400]  another week until i could actually get the ultrasound done so i mean too bad
[55:06.400 --> 55:09.040]  if there was anything majorly wrong with me but
[55:09.040 --> 55:14.160]  uh i made the appointment and i got into a to an x-ray and ultra sound center
[55:14.160 --> 55:19.040]  to get that done and why i was working what i went to the receptionist and
[55:19.040 --> 55:23.680]  while i was waiting to get my ultrasound another lady came in and she was in her
[55:23.680 --> 55:26.080]  fifties and she's like holding tissues and
[55:26.080 --> 55:30.320]  coughing and sputtering everywhere and i was close enough to the reception
[55:30.320 --> 55:33.600]  desk to hear her walk up there and she basically said you know i've got
[55:33.600 --> 55:37.520]  swine flu i'm here to get a a chest x-ray and and she's
[55:37.520 --> 55:41.120]  the lady actually said you know i'm worried about being with all the people
[55:41.120 --> 55:45.760]  what should i do anyway it felt like the twilight zone because the reception
[55:45.760 --> 55:48.800]  has told her to just go and sit down with everyone else in the waiting room
[55:48.800 --> 55:53.200]  she's coughing into these tissues and i'm like okay well i think well the big
[55:53.200 --> 55:58.480]  issue here the big issue here tim is that in the united states in england in
[55:58.480 --> 56:00.640]  canada in australia we're getting reports
[56:00.640 --> 56:04.160]  that are now confirmed we got these two months ago with the seasonal flu
[56:04.160 --> 56:09.360]  now with the h1n1 nasal and injectable they are forcibly injecting people
[56:09.360 --> 56:12.960]  especially elementary students and then lying about it later
[56:12.960 --> 56:17.280]  and saying they didn't but then all the cases we know about are where the
[56:17.280 --> 56:21.440]  children get sick or collapse from the shot then they have to admit okay we
[56:21.440 --> 56:25.520]  gave them a shot so there's a giant international program
[56:25.520 --> 56:32.000]  to secretly force this on people and that is just amazing
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.040]  yeah and i just couldn't understand because the government's running these
[56:35.040 --> 56:39.120]  ads on tv saying there's a health emergency and go and get your free
[56:39.120 --> 56:42.720]  vaccine and everything and then this lady who has swine flu and they're just
[56:42.720 --> 56:46.720]  asking you to sit in the in the waiting room with everyone else so i debated
[56:46.720 --> 56:49.600]  walking out and then they called me for my
[56:49.600 --> 56:53.440]  my ultrasound and i went in had that done and when i finished the
[56:53.440 --> 56:56.400]  the person who did the ultrasound said she was going to
[56:56.400 --> 56:59.920]  burn a disc with the the images on there and to go back and wait
[56:59.920 --> 57:03.920]  anyway i went back to the waiting room and this lady was still there coughing
[57:03.920 --> 57:08.160]  so i wasn't going to stay around i i told the receptionist there i said
[57:08.160 --> 57:11.760]  look can you please send the disc to my doctor i need to go
[57:11.760 --> 57:15.920]  and i left and then i made an appointment to go back and get the results with my
[57:15.920 --> 57:20.640]  doctor and anyway he questioned why i refused
[57:20.640 --> 57:24.080]  the the vaccine from the nurse that he'd ordered and i
[57:24.080 --> 57:27.360]  you know i went back into my reasoning and explained that
[57:27.360 --> 57:32.960]  and the disc hadn't came arrived with the the ultrasound so i explained what
[57:32.960 --> 57:36.480]  happened and that there was this lady who was there for a chest x-ray who had
[57:36.480 --> 57:39.840]  swine flu so i didn't feel safe around the virus and i
[57:39.840 --> 57:43.600]  and i left and then you know he said oh well if you had the vaccine you wouldn't
[57:43.600 --> 57:48.880]  have needed to worry would you and then to top everything off he told me he
[57:48.880 --> 57:52.000]  wanted to refer me for a psych evaluation
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.960]  because he believed that i was suffering from some sort of
[57:54.960 --> 57:59.840]  some sort of anxiety order yeah that's the new tyranny they did that over 100
[57:59.840 --> 58:03.040]  years ago in russia and of course 65 years ago in germany
[58:03.040 --> 58:06.160]  if you disagreed with anything the government was doing especially the
[58:06.160 --> 58:08.640]  medical system you were mentally ill it doesn't
[58:08.640 --> 58:12.800]  matter of more than half the doctors in the u.s in canada
[58:12.800 --> 58:17.920]  in germany don't want to take it themselves and the government gets a
[58:17.920 --> 58:21.360]  special clean vaccine in their words for themselves
[58:21.360 --> 58:26.960]  you are insane because you don't want to be forcibly injected
[58:26.960 --> 58:30.720]  amazing interesting story par for the course tim from the land down under

[58:53.360 --> 58:57.360]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[58:57.360 --> 59:01.120]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[59:01.120 --> 59:04.720]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[59:04.720 --> 59:08.960]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[59:08.960 --> 59:12.160]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[59:12.160 --> 59:14.800]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[59:14.800 --> 59:18.720]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[59:18.720 --> 59:22.240]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[59:22.240 --> 59:25.360]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[59:25.360 --> 59:28.400]  onages number five a solar power generator provides

[1:01:03.840 --> 1:01:08.320]  yes the secret copyright treaty now leaked
[1:01:08.320 --> 1:01:12.160]  you can take this for what it's worth but from internal sources
[1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:15.600]  from one person that was a former employee
[1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:20.080]  at fort detrick bio weapons laboratory in maryland
[1:01:20.080 --> 1:01:24.480]  that would then went to the cdc as well as someone who
[1:01:24.480 --> 1:01:28.480]  was very high ranking military that from what i understand got direct
[1:01:28.480 --> 1:01:32.240]  info from northern command this was back in april they both
[1:01:32.240 --> 1:01:36.480]  said that um when when the original swine flew
[1:01:36.480 --> 1:01:39.920]  um in it was talked about by the mainstream media
[1:01:39.920 --> 1:01:43.200]  that they said that that was uh they were coming and they were you know that
[1:01:43.200 --> 1:01:47.200]  was that this was the end game right there that this was a bio
[1:01:47.200 --> 1:01:52.640]  bioengineered weapon um dr a true odd who you've heard of
[1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:56.160]  uh he has a a paper that he wrote where he
[1:01:56.160 --> 1:01:59.760]  one of the interesting things he cites is that this that virus was
[1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:06.080]  engineered using the promise software um that which is the same stuff that
[1:02:06.080 --> 1:02:10.720]  michael rucano shuteau who was a former cia scientist
[1:02:10.720 --> 1:02:16.000]  uh built a back door for in the 80s well promise software is to track
[1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:20.000]  financial operations and stocks and bond trading
[1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.360]  i mean what do you mean it was used to write the virus
[1:02:23.360 --> 1:02:27.040]  it's uh it's well it was originally it was
[1:02:27.040 --> 1:02:30.640]  okay later when it was originally developed it didn't have those capabilities
[1:02:30.640 --> 1:02:34.720]  that i'm talking about but later uh artificial intelligence capabilities
[1:02:34.720 --> 1:02:38.480]  were added to it by ge aerospace and have since been
[1:02:38.480 --> 1:02:43.840]  greatly expanded by uh a place called the system architectures laboratory at
[1:02:43.840 --> 1:02:47.680]  george mason university with under alexander levis this is
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:02:52.000]  this is uh cited directly from the guy who was the
[1:02:52.000 --> 1:02:56.400]  uh the chief scientist for p-tech doctor who's st ibrahim who
[1:02:56.400 --> 1:03:02.240]  in dearer sing uh mentions in her in her testimony regarding this and basically
[1:03:02.240 --> 1:03:06.080]  the software is used to analyze you know it's run on supercomputers and they
[1:03:06.080 --> 1:03:09.120]  use it to analyze the genetic sequencing using something called
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:12.800]  reverse genetics well i know that's what uh i bm and the
[1:03:12.800 --> 1:03:15.360]  human genome are doing at the eugenics headquarters
[1:03:15.360 --> 1:03:21.280]  cold springs harbour and they this can be backed up by research if you if you
[1:03:21.280 --> 1:03:25.360]  just you can independently verify this we'll do this write us an article
[1:03:25.360 --> 1:03:28.080]  because i think i recognize your voice you've written some good
[1:03:28.080 --> 1:03:31.840]  uh info at the prison planet forum why don't you write it all up
[1:03:31.840 --> 1:03:35.600]  send it to writers and info wars dot com i appreciate
[1:03:35.600 --> 1:03:40.960]  i appreciate your call i know that a few months ago there was that israeli spy
[1:03:40.960 --> 1:03:43.360]  who they said was threatening the winehouse and they
[1:03:43.360 --> 1:03:48.320]  were were gassing his car and no one knew how for hours he could take the
[1:03:48.320 --> 1:03:52.000]  tear gas and then they grabbed him and it did turn out that he reportedly
[1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:55.840]  called into radio shows and had warned everybody that there
[1:03:55.840 --> 1:03:59.520]  was going to be a bio weapon release and the flu vaccine and i've tried to
[1:03:59.520 --> 1:04:03.440]  look over that and it's not completely substantiated but
[1:04:03.440 --> 1:04:06.240]  very interesting and we are trying to look into it there's just so much
[1:04:06.240 --> 1:04:10.000]  happening but thank you so much for reminding me
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:13.760]  of that report we put links to it kurt never wrote a story two days ago
[1:04:13.760 --> 1:04:17.040]  with a hyperlink at the bottom to some of the sites that are reporting that and
[1:04:17.040 --> 1:04:20.400]  kurt said you know we can't prove this but this is what people are saying
[1:04:20.400 --> 1:04:26.720]  and ask other researchers to look into that for themselves but there's no
[1:04:26.720 --> 1:04:30.480]  doubt the globalists are moving on every front there is no doubt
[1:04:30.480 --> 1:04:34.080]  that we are in a very very serious time right now we're going to go to break and
[1:04:34.080 --> 1:04:37.200]  come back with congressman ron paul we're going to start

[1:08:28.240 --> 1:08:32.400]  2009 and for the next 20 minutes or so congressman
[1:08:32.400 --> 1:08:36.240]  ron paul joins us from capitol hill and there is a
[1:08:36.240 --> 1:08:42.720]  lot to talk about today first off out of the gates you obviously got
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:48.080]  290 plus sponsors to begin the audit of the private secretive federal reserve
[1:08:48.080 --> 1:08:51.520]  you've talked this week about some maneuvers by some of the committee
[1:08:51.520 --> 1:08:55.520]  chairman to gut the bill can you give us an update on
[1:08:55.520 --> 1:08:58.640]  where your legislation is going congressman
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:03.520]  well actually right now we have 309 and that's 130 some democrats
[1:09:03.520 --> 1:09:06.800]  as well as all the republicans and at one time
[1:09:06.800 --> 1:09:10.720]  a male wad had indicated to me that he would get a provision put in the bill
[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:16.240]  by barney frank which would be a very very limited version of an audit which
[1:09:16.240 --> 1:09:18.960]  would be a distraction if nothing else
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:22.640]  even though the little bit we was doing it was okay it was just so
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:26.080]  so small it was canceling out most of what i wanted to do
[1:09:26.080 --> 1:09:30.400]  but his provision didn't get put into the bill we are now in the middle of doing
[1:09:30.400 --> 1:09:32.800]  the bill i thought there was even a chance today
[1:09:32.800 --> 1:09:36.720]  that i would get to offer my amendment which is 1207 to the bill
[1:09:36.720 --> 1:09:40.160]  but it was just announced a few minutes ago that barney frank said that
[1:09:40.160 --> 1:09:45.360]  well the controversial type of amendments won't be
[1:09:45.360 --> 1:09:49.280]  done until after the labor day or the veterans day break which is next week
[1:09:49.280 --> 1:09:52.960]  so it won't be this week and it won't be next week but the following week
[1:09:52.960 --> 1:09:56.560]  i suspect they're just lining up their ducks and they'll probably be
[1:09:56.560 --> 1:09:59.520]  lots of attempts to water things down but i don't know
[1:09:59.520 --> 1:10:03.360]  but we'll have to wait and see so we're in the middle of it we're coming close
[1:10:03.360 --> 1:10:07.680]  to at least a a initial climax of the bill on
[1:10:07.680 --> 1:10:12.640]  what the banking committee will do and uh it has to survive there and has to
[1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:16.800]  come out there pretty whole or things won't look so good for us
[1:10:16.800 --> 1:10:21.040]  but i'm cautiously optimistic about it but the momentum's clearly shifted
[1:10:21.040 --> 1:10:24.800]  20-something years ago you might get two or three co-sponsors now you have
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:30.480]  over 300 a giant house majority so so the momentum is shifting against the
[1:10:30.480 --> 1:10:34.240]  secret of organization yeah and if we can get a clean vote
[1:10:34.240 --> 1:10:38.880]  um i can't imagine very many wanting to be on record to vote against this it
[1:10:38.880 --> 1:10:42.400]  just it's just is going to give them a lot of grief
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:52.560]  especially congressman
[1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:59.840]  okay phone system glitch we will get congressman ron paul
[1:10:59.840 --> 1:11:03.600]  back on with us in just a moment
[1:11:06.480 --> 1:11:11.040]  tell you we got gremlins in our phone system or the congressman does
[1:11:11.040 --> 1:11:14.880]  i got a whole host of important questions that i want to
[1:11:14.880 --> 1:11:21.920]  ask the congressman here today and we're going to be going over those
[1:11:21.920 --> 1:11:28.800]  here in just a moment with him like the death of the dollar
[1:11:28.800 --> 1:11:32.720]  the flu situation afghanistan the big republican wins in new jersey
[1:11:32.720 --> 1:11:45.680]  and virginia and a lot more
[1:11:45.680 --> 1:11:50.000]  all right and of course we will post this
[1:11:50.000 --> 1:11:58.400]  archived up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[1:11:58.400 --> 1:12:03.600]  okay congressman got you back quickly thank you
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:09.600]  congressman that is a phone system situation happening
[1:12:09.600 --> 1:12:16.160]  obviously on therein so we will try to get congressman ron paul
[1:12:16.160 --> 1:12:20.560]  back on right now
[1:12:22.000 --> 1:12:26.480]  in the meantime we do have uh joe rogan joining us
[1:12:26.480 --> 1:12:30.000]  later in studio today and laurence j
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.720]  kotlakov he of course is a boston university
[1:12:34.720 --> 1:12:38.240]  professor of economics
[1:12:39.360 --> 1:12:45.360]  to discuss the mclatchy newspaper article that he was quoted in
[1:12:45.360 --> 1:12:52.240]  that we have been discussing how goldman sacks secretly bet
[1:12:52.240 --> 1:12:57.360]  on the u.s housing crash okay maybe threes the charm congressman do we have
[1:12:57.360 --> 1:13:00.400]  you i'm back i don't know what happened
[1:13:00.400 --> 1:13:05.280]  gremlins in the house switchboard um okay we were finishing up with the fed
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:09.040]  on monetary policy congressman you've long talked about
[1:13:09.040 --> 1:13:13.120]  the central banks using the dollar to prop up the empire
[1:13:13.120 --> 1:13:16.480]  now the g20 is discussing abandoning the dollar
[1:13:16.480 --> 1:13:19.840]  uh what is happening from your research
[1:13:19.840 --> 1:13:23.040]  perspective with the dollar right now and what will happen
[1:13:23.040 --> 1:13:27.200]  if the dollar is fully abandoned why don't think anybody knows right now if
[1:13:27.200 --> 1:13:31.600]  they just let it go and the dollar's rejected then it'll be uh
[1:13:31.600 --> 1:13:35.120]  people will have to resort to sound money and they'd have to resort to commodity
[1:13:35.120 --> 1:13:40.720]  of money but as you say the g20 or the imf and the world
[1:13:40.720 --> 1:13:45.600]  leaders so to speak are going to try to replace it i think the market has
[1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:49.120]  has replaced the dollar reserve standard they've gotten rid of that i don't
[1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:52.640]  think they can rebuild on that so they are uh
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:56.000]  rushing around trying to figure out what they what they'll replace it with
[1:13:56.000 --> 1:13:59.360]  i think what they'll try to do is come up with a basket of currencies
[1:13:59.360 --> 1:14:03.280]  they even might be tempted to put a little bit of gold in there but it's not
[1:14:03.280 --> 1:14:06.720]  going to suffice if they don't have even a little bit of gold
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:10.480]  even if they come up with another worldwide fiat standard
[1:14:10.480 --> 1:14:14.000]  i don't think it's going to convey trust i think i think they're behind
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:16.800]  they're between the rock and hard place and it's not going to be easy for them
[1:14:16.800 --> 1:14:20.240]  to push something on us but one thing for sure i think
[1:14:20.240 --> 1:14:24.080]  there's going to be a lot of chaos and i think there's going to be a a lot more
[1:14:24.080 --> 1:14:27.920]  economic problems and more poverty and more you know
[1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:34.880]  depression in the world just because of this absolutely so just to be clear
[1:14:34.880 --> 1:14:39.360]  you agree with the big economic headlines we've seen the last month
[1:14:39.360 --> 1:14:42.800]  that the dollar as the world reserve currency has been abandoned
[1:14:42.800 --> 1:14:47.040]  china india the european union the arabs are now buying
[1:14:47.040 --> 1:14:51.040]  more foreign currencies than they are the dollar they still hold
[1:14:51.040 --> 1:14:55.520]  an overall majority of dollars at around 62 to 63 percent
[1:14:55.520 --> 1:14:58.560]  but they are now abandoning the dollar as reserve currency
[1:14:58.560 --> 1:15:03.040]  hey do you agree with that b what will this do to our economy
[1:15:03.040 --> 1:15:06.320]  what's going to hurt the economy i wouldn't say it's abandoned but it's
[1:15:06.320 --> 1:15:10.480]  it's less important all the time i mean the fact that they can still have 60
[1:15:10.480 --> 1:15:13.680]  percent reserves means it's still still there
[1:15:13.680 --> 1:15:17.200]  but the market i look at the market signals and i think the thing that
[1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:19.920]  happened this week was very very significant
[1:15:19.920 --> 1:15:23.680]  that is when the imf announces that they're going to dump 200
[1:15:23.680 --> 1:15:27.760]  tons of gold on the market well you know early a person was thinking
[1:15:27.760 --> 1:15:31.200]  they were hoping well that gold out there that's going to drive down the price
[1:15:31.200 --> 1:15:33.760]  of gold and make all the fiat currencies look better
[1:15:33.760 --> 1:15:38.240]  but what happened a bank from asia india buys the whole
[1:15:38.240 --> 1:15:42.640]  lot which sent a signal i think to the world markets
[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:46.320]  that in essence gold has been re monetized they
[1:15:46.320 --> 1:15:50.960]  it never gets demonetized but it has less importance as money when all the
[1:15:50.960 --> 1:15:55.520]  country's rejected but i think this is a major major signal
[1:15:55.520 --> 1:15:59.280]  that the dollar is getting closer it's on its last legs and gold is getting more
[1:15:59.280 --> 1:16:02.320]  important and as the chinese buy less and less
[1:16:02.320 --> 1:16:05.520]  they they have already started buying gold and
[1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:09.440]  they don't want to buy too much too fast and you know shoot the price up
[1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:12.960]  you know too quickly i think that's coming i think the gold price is destined
[1:16:12.960 --> 1:16:16.240]  to go a lot higher than the dollar is going to go a lot lower
[1:16:16.240 --> 1:16:21.680]  and they cannot be thrown gold they can disrupt and play these games for a
[1:16:21.680 --> 1:16:25.440]  long long time but in many ways this is very very good
[1:16:25.440 --> 1:16:29.280]  because it tells us that the government no longer can get away with just
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:33.280]  printing money to finance their schemes as their schemes that are so damaging
[1:16:33.280 --> 1:16:36.880]  to us whether it's the welfare or the warfare it all
[1:16:36.880 --> 1:16:40.160]  hurts the people because they have to pay the bill so
[1:16:40.160 --> 1:16:43.280]  some of these things are good signals although it means that we have to be
[1:16:43.280 --> 1:16:46.400]  concerned about the chaos that might erupt
[1:16:46.400 --> 1:16:52.160]  absolutely congressman the private central banks as you know are
[1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:56.400]  financing the Copenhagen treaty i have the treaty here
[1:16:56.400 --> 1:17:01.520]  in front of me all 200 pages of the framework convention on climate change
[1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:04.880]  it states as ban chi moon wrote last week of the
[1:17:04.880 --> 1:17:09.120]  new york times that this is global governance
[1:17:09.120 --> 1:17:13.680]  and that select groups of private interest
[1:17:13.680 --> 1:17:18.240]  are going to be able to decide who can have a factory who can have a business
[1:17:18.240 --> 1:17:20.880]  they can decide who's going to get the carbon credits
[1:17:20.880 --> 1:17:25.520]  this scheme was designed by ken lay as congress has reported
[1:17:25.520 --> 1:17:31.200]  the senate committee has now approved the climate bill as
[1:17:31.200 --> 1:17:35.600]  Reuters reports if our economy under globalization and after
[1:17:35.600 --> 1:17:39.600]  and gat is already sputtering what's going to happen if we allow the very
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:43.360]  same central banks to create this new derivative system
[1:17:43.360 --> 1:17:47.200]  well if it works it's a work for a short while and companies like goldman sacks
[1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:50.160]  and a few others will rip us off and they'll
[1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:54.880]  you know get even more wealth but it cannot help the economy it has to hurt
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:58.320]  the economy and it can't possibly help the environment because they're totally
[1:17:58.320 --> 1:18:01.520]  off track on that it's a it might turn out to be one of the
[1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:05.680]  biggest hoaxes of all history this whole global warming
[1:18:05.680 --> 1:18:09.760]  terrorism that they've been using so but we'll have to just wait and see but it
[1:18:09.760 --> 1:18:12.960]  cannot be helpful it's going to hurt everybody
[1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:16.560]  what's the inside baseball word in congress uh
[1:18:16.560 --> 1:18:20.000]  diane feinstein and barbara boxers say they're going to be able to pass it this
[1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:23.680]  year next year but more and more evidence on the ground
[1:18:23.680 --> 1:18:28.240]  shows that we're going to be able to beat the house and senate version of the
[1:18:28.240 --> 1:18:31.440]  climate bill that is meant to tie in to the Copenhagen
[1:18:31.440 --> 1:18:34.640]  un takeover i think there is a chance and i think
[1:18:34.640 --> 1:18:38.480]  these elections uh might send a signal i think
[1:18:38.480 --> 1:18:43.920]  the continual uh presence of the tea party movement and the people speaking
[1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:49.120]  out might wake them up finally you know uh and say hey maybe we are doing too
[1:18:49.120 --> 1:18:53.360]  much too fast and they might back off right now they're not absolutely
[1:18:53.360 --> 1:18:56.240]  positive they have the votes on this medical bill
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:18:59.280]  will know shortly whether the house will see if they have the votes they think
[1:18:59.280 --> 1:19:01.360]  the house can do it faster than the senate
[1:19:01.360 --> 1:19:04.240]  they're going to try to do that on saturday of this week
[1:19:04.240 --> 1:19:08.000]  uh but uh they're they have two problems uh
[1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:12.240]  it's not automatic and thank goodness for radio talk shows and the internet
[1:19:12.240 --> 1:19:15.280]  for us to get this information out that's what's rallying the troops certainly
[1:19:15.280 --> 1:19:18.800]  is in the main street media speaking of the internet we're talking to congress
[1:19:18.800 --> 1:19:23.120]  from ron paul uh we now have the cyber security act
[1:19:23.120 --> 1:19:26.720]  three days ago finally the national security
[1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:33.280]  uh blocked copyright treaty has now leaked and it says open
[1:19:33.280 --> 1:19:38.480]  taxing open regulation of the web i can be handed over to the un
[1:19:38.480 --> 1:19:43.600]  total control guilty until proven innocent copyright rules shutting down
[1:19:43.600 --> 1:19:48.240]  websites isps uh and really un control over the internet
[1:19:48.240 --> 1:19:52.800]  where do you stand on that congressman well it's very frightening and i think
[1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:57.280]  that if they're successful this just hope that internet is too big and too
[1:19:57.280 --> 1:20:01.040]  complex for them ever to have controls but they're making the attempt
[1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:04.880]  they would love to put us out of business but uh
[1:20:04.880 --> 1:20:09.760]  i am uh hopeful that that we don't ever allow it to go that far but they are
[1:20:09.760 --> 1:20:13.040]  doing everything in the world uh to control the internet
[1:20:13.040 --> 1:20:17.440]  and uh that to me would be a real tragedy a lot of people say it could
[1:20:17.440 --> 1:20:20.480]  never happen it's too big they never try it
[1:20:20.480 --> 1:20:25.040]  they are stating on record the white house the nsa
[1:20:25.040 --> 1:20:28.080]  repeatedly in the last month the white house has said we may have to shut the
[1:20:28.080 --> 1:20:32.000]  internet off to save it and during the flu pandemic or other emergency
[1:20:32.000 --> 1:20:36.240]  only let you go to government sites that's that's quite a trial balloon
[1:20:36.240 --> 1:20:40.480]  by the white house yeah and all those authorities are packed in
[1:20:40.480 --> 1:20:43.680]  you know emergency legislation they don't really have to come to the
[1:20:43.680 --> 1:20:46.800]  congress to do that they do that on occasion just to get it
[1:20:46.800 --> 1:20:50.640]  rubber stamp but there's been so much emergency legislation passed and
[1:20:50.640 --> 1:20:54.400]  besides if it isn't passed you know what uh how much license they take with
[1:20:54.400 --> 1:20:58.640]  executive orders and uh the the various procedures that they
[1:20:58.640 --> 1:21:04.160]  they use so i know if they claim this is uh for national security reasons
[1:21:04.160 --> 1:21:08.960]  they just go ahead and do it so uh it's a very dangerous time that we in which we
[1:21:08.960 --> 1:21:13.280]  live you're a medical doctor and you've also uh
[1:21:13.280 --> 1:21:17.600]  worked with the von mis institute and and received awards from them for your
[1:21:17.600 --> 1:21:21.440]  economic understanding and of course this flu situation is economic for the
[1:21:21.440 --> 1:21:24.320]  vaccine makers government gets to have a power grab
[1:21:24.320 --> 1:21:28.480]  but you've pointed out that obama won't give the flu shot to his daughters
[1:21:28.480 --> 1:21:32.000]  now even time magazine is reporting the german government military
[1:21:32.000 --> 1:21:35.120]  won't take the shot with the squalene or the mercury
[1:21:35.120 --> 1:21:40.080]  or the ender lukin 2 or any of this so government's taking one vaccine the
[1:21:40.080 --> 1:21:43.840]  people's getting another uh your take on that congressman
[1:21:43.840 --> 1:21:48.160]  well that always happens that way and i did see a report after i made that
[1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:50.640]  announcement because he had said it in public
[1:21:50.640 --> 1:21:53.520]  about obama's daughter's not getting the shot
[1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:57.280]  but uh since that time we are told now they have gotten it but you'd wonder
[1:21:57.280 --> 1:22:01.040]  whether which one they got and and whether or not it had the mercury
[1:22:01.040 --> 1:22:05.840]  and or whatnot but you know we've done it to our own military personnel
[1:22:05.840 --> 1:22:09.680]  you know and and the persian golf war they got a lot of inoculations and
[1:22:09.680 --> 1:22:13.520]  people came back with her persian golf war syndrome and was a combination of
[1:22:13.520 --> 1:22:19.680]  of chemicals and inoculations so it's uh to me though it's a mixed bag
[1:22:19.680 --> 1:22:23.440]  because a lot of people don't want it and they're fighting it and they know
[1:22:23.440 --> 1:22:25.760]  and they're being forced to take it and other people
[1:22:25.760 --> 1:22:29.520]  get panicked into it and they'll line up for hours and hours and hours waiting
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:33.360]  it waiting for as if as if this was a really really
[1:22:33.360 --> 1:22:37.360]  serious crisis it's a serious disease and people do die but
[1:22:37.360 --> 1:22:41.840]  even these few uh the numbers of people that have died from it
[1:22:41.840 --> 1:22:45.600]  they're significant but they're very small compared to regular flu
[1:22:45.600 --> 1:22:50.480]  and uh and many times the individuals i think over two-thirds of the children
[1:22:50.480 --> 1:22:53.920]  that died so far had other serious medical problems so
[1:22:53.920 --> 1:22:58.400]  but it but the the drumbeat for the fear to build up is
[1:22:58.400 --> 1:23:01.680]  to me it's all done they have done for that reason for the people to
[1:23:01.680 --> 1:23:05.840]  become more obedient and more dependent on the government
[1:23:05.840 --> 1:23:08.960]  so they're trying to set the precedent for this medical tyranny to
[1:23:08.960 --> 1:23:12.480]  force their will on us i think it's just another attempt
[1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:16.800]  i'm sure there are a bunch of people who believe well no this is very serious
[1:23:16.800 --> 1:23:20.720]  the medical people have told us this and and this is what we have to do
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:24.480]  but let's say if let's say it was a reasonable thing
[1:23:24.480 --> 1:23:29.200]  you know to give people shots i think that the real message here is
[1:23:29.200 --> 1:23:33.760]  why should the government be in charge of it you know if they're in charge
[1:23:33.760 --> 1:23:36.720]  there's a shortage the people who don't want it are being forced to take it the
[1:23:36.720 --> 1:23:40.960]  people who want it you can't get it it's costing a lot a lot of money the
[1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:44.240]  the other vaccine the regular flu shots are not available
[1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:48.880]  and it's on and on and right now i saw a chart uh just a couple days ago that
[1:23:48.880 --> 1:23:53.920]  shows that uh this uh individual believe that um swine
[1:23:53.920 --> 1:23:57.360]  flu is going to peak you know within another week or two
[1:23:57.360 --> 1:24:01.200]  and if it peaks and starts to drop off naturally that's about the time we're
[1:24:01.200 --> 1:24:04.720]  going to have all these flu shots coming in and don't have the flu shot that
[1:24:04.720 --> 1:24:07.360]  maybe is much more important the point being
[1:24:07.360 --> 1:24:11.360]  sure why should they be in charge and why should we turn over our health care
[1:24:11.360 --> 1:24:14.560]  to these clowns who are trying to distribute uh
[1:24:14.560 --> 1:24:19.040]  you know a vaccine so either way uh it's bad congressman boy that we shouldn't
[1:24:19.040 --> 1:24:22.320]  be doing it on top of that all over the country schools are
[1:24:22.320 --> 1:24:25.840]  injecting children even when their parents say don't do it and the
[1:24:25.840 --> 1:24:27.840]  schools are saying oops it's an accident
[1:24:27.840 --> 1:24:32.080]  clearly that's premeditated but shifting gears
[1:24:32.080 --> 1:24:37.360]  now we saw republican wins in new jersey and virginia
[1:24:37.360 --> 1:24:41.920]  the president's approval rating when he was first elected up in the 80s now
[1:24:41.920 --> 1:24:45.120]  down the low 40s but republicans still by
[1:24:45.120 --> 1:24:47.760]  and large have low approval ratings unless they're like yourself
[1:24:47.760 --> 1:24:52.400]  who's actually a constitutionalist we know that in 2010
[1:24:52.400 --> 1:24:55.600]  there's going to be a huge backlash republicans will take back
[1:24:55.600 --> 1:24:59.520]  a lot of seats but if they don't deliver on smaller government and and
[1:24:59.520 --> 1:25:03.920]  fiscal uh sound constitutional policies uh
[1:25:03.920 --> 1:25:07.600]  then we're going to have a real crisis on our hands and if we wait to get
[1:25:07.600 --> 1:25:10.960]  politically active until 2011 into 2012
[1:25:10.960 --> 1:25:15.360]  so much of this globalization would have already been expanded and submitted
[1:25:15.360 --> 1:25:18.240]  i know that this is still off in the future but
[1:25:18.240 --> 1:25:22.640]  la times new york times everybody's talking i get calls every day
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:26.240]  saying when is ron paul going to announce for 2012
[1:25:26.240 --> 1:25:29.840]  because if you announce early you can build the coalition
[1:25:29.840 --> 1:25:33.520]  you can get an even more elevated position in the media
[1:25:33.520 --> 1:25:38.160]  you can speak for the people that don't want war that don't want big government
[1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:41.520]  that don't want banker bailouts if you wait to announce
[1:25:41.520 --> 1:25:44.960]  until 2011 after your congressional win
[1:25:44.960 --> 1:25:49.760]  coming up but i guess i'm i'm being presumptive i mean you're not even
[1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:53.120]  saying you're going to announce it 2011
[1:25:53.120 --> 1:25:58.240]  no i'm i'm still thinking a lot about that right now it just doesn't seem like
[1:25:58.240 --> 1:26:02.080]  the best thing to do uh even long term or even
[1:26:02.080 --> 1:26:05.440]  on a short term basis so i'm not i'm i've just
[1:26:05.440 --> 1:26:08.880]  i'm decided about the whole thing you know so i'm not about to
[1:26:08.880 --> 1:26:12.400]  say that i'm planning uh to do one thing or another
[1:26:12.400 --> 1:26:15.680]  congressman still think i i think you make some good points but i think time
[1:26:15.680 --> 1:26:19.680]  is still it's still a little bit early to start talking about it
[1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:25.600]  but so much is happening and if you step up even
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:29.360]  further and and no one's saying that you haven't done more than anybody else
[1:26:29.360 --> 1:26:33.600]  and start building the coalition now uh
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:37.360]  i'd really unless there's massive election fraud i see no way that you
[1:26:37.360 --> 1:26:41.040]  could lose the republican uh primary i mean
[1:26:41.040 --> 1:26:46.160]  how can we allow a rhino uh someone who's not really a constitutionalist like
[1:26:46.160 --> 1:26:49.920]  another mccain another mint romney to lead
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:54.320]  conservatives and libertarians down another rat hole i mean you are the man
[1:26:54.320 --> 1:26:57.920]  for the job and i don't pretend to understand your political strategy i
[1:26:57.920 --> 1:27:01.920]  know you're much more intelligent and wise than i am and have more experience
[1:27:01.920 --> 1:27:06.720]  it just makes perfect sense for at least some time the next six to eight months
[1:27:06.720 --> 1:27:10.640]  to announce but you're saying you're not even sure at this time i mean even if
[1:27:10.640 --> 1:27:14.320]  you didn't win you would have huge fundraising you'd be able to buy ads
[1:27:14.320 --> 1:27:18.080]  you'd be all over the media you'll be the only candidate that will inject
[1:27:18.080 --> 1:27:20.800]  real issues i mean you're the only man for the job i mean
[1:27:20.800 --> 1:27:26.400]  fate and and responsibility and destiny says that you are the man for the job
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:30.400]  well you have to realize you're not the average uh
[1:27:30.400 --> 1:27:34.320]  republican primary voter you're a little bit you're a little bit more
[1:27:34.320 --> 1:27:37.120]  optimistic about what we might be able to do
[1:27:37.120 --> 1:27:41.200]  but we still have a lot of contend with when you get involved in partisan
[1:27:41.200 --> 1:27:44.240]  politics and you you follow that stuff that was going on over
[1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:47.920]  in nevada how they really handle us i think we'll do better
[1:27:47.920 --> 1:27:52.000]  if we ever did it again but uh you know they they just
[1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:55.200]  closed down the shop if they think you're going to win so you have a lot of
[1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:58.800]  obstacles to overcome but the most important thing this is what you've
[1:27:58.800 --> 1:28:02.640]  emphasized as well politics are very important but also
[1:28:02.640 --> 1:28:07.680]  is getting these issues out and talking about the philosophy and why we need it
[1:28:07.680 --> 1:28:11.440]  and get the people energized and that should be ongoing of course that's why
[1:28:11.440 --> 1:28:14.560]  we keep campaign for liberty moving in that direction because
[1:28:14.560 --> 1:28:18.640]  people have to understand things like the Federal Reserve just think a couple
[1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:23.200]  years ago not too many people even talked about the Federal Reserve and now
[1:28:23.200 --> 1:28:26.800]  they can do national polling on the Federal Reserve to get opinion so
[1:28:26.800 --> 1:28:30.000]  in that sense i think we're making progress exactly we've gone
[1:28:30.000 --> 1:28:34.400]  from almost no one knowing it's a private cartel to over 75 percent wanting
[1:28:34.400 --> 1:28:38.560]  an audit or for it to be abolished it's only a win-win for you to run
[1:28:38.560 --> 1:28:41.680]  because it will elevate you it will have you in the debates
[1:28:41.680 --> 1:28:44.960]  and i don't see any way you won't run unless
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:48.800]  you've got medical problems and you're in great shape you look like you're 60
[1:28:48.800 --> 1:28:53.040]  congressman and i'm just begging you for millions of other people
[1:28:53.040 --> 1:28:57.040]  to kick off the campaign sooner rather than later i want to commend you
[1:28:57.040 --> 1:29:00.880]  for for you know helping to get your son to run for the senate people need to get
[1:29:00.880 --> 1:29:05.120]  behind him right now and as you said the biggest movement now on the
[1:29:05.120 --> 1:29:08.720]  universities isn't the burnout fake left or the burnout fake
[1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:13.680]  right it is the libertarian free market non-collectivist
[1:29:13.680 --> 1:29:18.320]  movement that you have helped to grow and energize and you are the omnibudsman
[1:29:18.320 --> 1:29:21.440]  of liberty the leading light for freedom worldwide
[1:29:21.440 --> 1:29:25.760]  as even the check president has said and i just want to salute you and thank you
[1:29:25.760 --> 1:29:29.200]  in closing we got 30 seconds are they going to be able to ram through the
[1:29:29.200 --> 1:29:32.560]  government takeover of health care oh they're going to get it through the
[1:29:32.560 --> 1:29:35.680]  house but whether the whole thing gets through i think it'll get part of it but
[1:29:35.680 --> 1:29:39.680]  not the whole thing so uh we'll wait and see
[1:29:39.680 --> 1:29:43.840]  and we we've adapted in this country to incrementalism we never socialize all
[1:29:43.840 --> 1:29:47.040]  at once we just take it by pieces and think that we've
[1:29:47.040 --> 1:29:49.840]  really resisted something so unfortunately it's going to get worse
[1:29:49.840 --> 1:29:55.120]  rather than better thank you so much congressman god bless you

[1:33:22.560 --> 1:33:28.720]  you just got a chance to hear congressman ron paul on with us though the
[1:33:28.720 --> 1:33:32.560]  capital switchboard cut him off twice
[1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:36.320]  i've heard him on other radio shows when that happens
[1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:39.680]  he must have somebody in that office
[1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:43.200]  a train gorilla or something somewhere in the in the capital building that's
[1:33:43.200 --> 1:33:46.320]  running the switchboard
[1:33:46.320 --> 1:33:50.880]  i could get more conspiratorial and say that they were knocking him off
[1:33:50.880 --> 1:33:54.560]  air with us but that's probably not the case
[1:33:58.240 --> 1:34:01.280]  let's go ahead and take some phone calls right now we got this economist
[1:34:01.280 --> 1:34:03.760]  coming up i got a bunch of other news i want to hit as well
[1:34:03.760 --> 1:34:11.280]  plus there's a video clip of robert kennedy jr on television talking about
[1:34:13.840 --> 1:34:17.840]  what vaccines are doing to people and you've got all these hollywood stars
[1:34:17.840 --> 1:34:22.400]  coming out you've got even people like bill marr coming out against vaccines
[1:34:22.400 --> 1:34:27.440]  you've got the the founder of smashing pumpkins coming out against vaccines
[1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:31.120]  you've got all these politicians coming out against vaccines it shows how the
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:34.880]  media and the vaccine cult keeps telling us we're cokes
[1:34:34.880 --> 1:34:38.960]  telling us we're liars saying there's no mercury saying it can't brain damage you
[1:34:38.960 --> 1:34:42.720]  we're mentally ill and that's only discrediting them
[1:34:42.720 --> 1:34:48.160]  and the momentum has clearly not just shifted against the vaccine pushers
[1:34:48.160 --> 1:34:51.680]  but has fully shifted against them it's a route now
[1:34:51.680 --> 1:34:55.440]  and that's why that you have this attempted hype with a non-pandemic flu
[1:34:55.440 --> 1:34:57.920]  strain a flu strain that's very weak compared to the
[1:34:57.920 --> 1:35:01.520]  regular seasonal flu that's why you have this incredible hype is an attempt
[1:35:01.520 --> 1:35:04.240]  of them to say you don't want shots you want to break the
[1:35:04.240 --> 1:35:07.840]  the precedent and the mind control that you've got to take the Gardasil shot and
[1:35:07.840 --> 1:35:11.040]  all these other vaccines and hepatitis shot
[1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:14.320]  oh yeah we're going to scare you we're going to hype it we're going to stage
[1:35:14.320 --> 1:35:17.680]  artificial scarcity of the vaccine and say we don't have enough of it
[1:35:17.680 --> 1:35:20.480]  and stage events where we tell people come down and get the free shot and then
[1:35:20.480 --> 1:35:23.280]  we don't have any of it to show people panicking
[1:35:23.280 --> 1:35:26.320]  we're going to throw everything we've got at you to try to manipulate you and
[1:35:26.320 --> 1:35:28.960]  it's not working
[1:35:28.960 --> 1:35:32.160]  again the global the globalists are in trouble on every front
[1:35:32.160 --> 1:35:37.360]  75 plus percent of americans and gallup polls wanted to abolish or audited
[1:35:37.360 --> 1:35:40.960]  over 90 percent of americans want to get rid of naftan cat
[1:35:40.960 --> 1:35:44.320]  obama had to lie and say he was going to get rid of it to get elected now he
[1:35:44.320 --> 1:35:49.680]  says i never said that we have that in fall the republic
[1:35:49.680 --> 1:35:52.000]  a lot of good things are happening we're going to go to your phone calls but
[1:35:52.000 --> 1:35:53.600]  let's go ahead and play this robert
[1:35:53.600 --> 1:35:58.080]  kennedy clip right now here it is
[1:36:03.280 --> 1:36:07.760]  to generate what happened was the vaccine schedule was increased we went
[1:36:07.760 --> 1:36:11.600]  up from receiving about 10 vaccines in our generation
[1:36:11.600 --> 1:36:16.640]  to these kids receive 24 vaccines and they all had this thimerosal in this
[1:36:16.640 --> 1:36:20.080]  mercury and nobody bothered to do an
[1:36:20.080 --> 1:36:23.920]  analysis of what the cumulative impact of all that mercury was doing to kids
[1:36:23.920 --> 1:36:28.320]  as it turns out we are injecting our children with 400 times the amount of
[1:36:28.320 --> 1:36:32.000]  mercury that fda or epa considered safe a
[1:36:32.000 --> 1:36:38.000]  child on his first day that he's born um is injected with a hepatitis b shot
[1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:42.320]  under epa guidelines he would be have to have to be 275 pounds
[1:36:42.320 --> 1:36:46.720]  to safely absorb that shot and yet we're just constantly pumping our kids with
[1:36:46.720 --> 1:36:50.720]  these vaccines and what happened what happened was that
[1:36:50.720 --> 1:36:57.680]  um in 1988 one in every 2,500 american children had autism
[1:36:57.680 --> 1:37:03.280]  today one in every 166 children have autism and plus one in six children
[1:37:03.280 --> 1:37:06.960]  have other kinds of learning disorders other kinds of neurological
[1:37:06.960 --> 1:37:10.400]  disorders speech delay language disorders add
[1:37:10.400 --> 1:37:14.240]  hyperactivity that all seem to be connected that are all connected
[1:37:14.240 --> 1:37:18.080]  the science shows are all connected to autism you know bobby what we've always
[1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:21.600]  done you and i could could debate a thousand different issues whether it's
[1:37:21.600 --> 1:37:24.320]  terry schiva or the environment i think would agree
[1:37:24.320 --> 1:37:28.000]  on the environment um but in this case you've got the federal government
[1:37:28.000 --> 1:37:30.640]  coming in saying well there's no really there's no good science
[1:37:30.640 --> 1:37:33.680]  of course in politics science always gets diluted
[1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:38.640]  why hasn't the federal government stepped up and it worked more because
[1:37:38.640 --> 1:37:42.480]  listen bobby i can't prove it tonight you can't prove it but
[1:37:42.480 --> 1:37:46.080]  intuitively you look at the spike you look at what happened with the
[1:37:46.080 --> 1:37:50.080]  marisol there is no doubt in my mind maybe it's two years from now maybe
[1:37:50.080 --> 1:37:52.480]  it's five years from now maybe it's 10 years from now
[1:37:52.480 --> 1:37:56.640]  we're going to find out that the marisol causes in my opinion
[1:37:56.640 --> 1:38:00.640]  autism you know what the science is out there today for anybody who bothers to
[1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:04.000]  read it and i i have read it actually on my website this week
[1:38:04.000 --> 1:38:08.080]  robertfkennedyjr.com i'm publishing an article that goes
[1:38:08.080 --> 1:38:11.760]  through all of the science but the science is clear and what
[1:38:11.760 --> 1:38:14.240]  happens is i read the science at first and there's
[1:38:14.240 --> 1:38:16.960]  literally hundreds and hundreds of studies that connect
[1:38:16.960 --> 1:38:21.600]  time aerosol to you know to these disastrous neurological disorders
[1:38:21.600 --> 1:38:25.920]  then i went i talked to the scientists then i went and i talked to the federal
[1:38:25.920 --> 1:38:29.600]  bureaucrats who are defending time aerosol and i said what are you
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:33.600]  relying on and i looked at the science they're relying on and i can tell you
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:36.320]  joe it is so weak and you and i have seen you know
[1:38:36.320 --> 1:38:39.120]  legal practice with junk science and we know
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:42.480]  you know what these phony scientists are who create a big tobacco
[1:38:42.480 --> 1:38:46.240]  right it happens in this oil and this is happening in global warming and now
[1:38:46.240 --> 1:38:49.360]  it's happening in a way that's impacting our kids
[1:38:49.360 --> 1:38:53.840]  lies this is classic tobacco science it is junk science and i was looking at
[1:38:53.840 --> 1:38:58.000]  these reports and saying this is the best this is what you're relying on
[1:38:58.000 --> 1:39:01.680]  they know it's fraudulent and now we have the transcripts explain it to me
[1:39:01.680 --> 1:39:04.880]  bobby okay i mean explain it to me if that's the case
[1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:08.160]  i mean you you and i both know about politics obviously
[1:39:08.160 --> 1:39:12.720]  politicians like to get reelected why are they sitting back and live if if our
[1:39:12.720 --> 1:39:15.520]  children are being poisoned if the science is there
[1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:19.360]  why are they sitting back and letting our children uh be poisoned
[1:39:19.360 --> 1:39:25.440]  because the the the the same regulatory bureaucrats that green lighted
[1:39:25.440 --> 1:39:29.600]  on flint aerosol originally are now trying to cover their tracks to see why
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:32.400]  they're operation right and they're working with the pharmaceutical
[1:39:32.400 --> 1:39:35.040]  industry and we now have the transcripts of this
[1:39:35.040 --> 1:39:39.360]  secret meeting that they did in simpson with georgia and two in the year 2000
[1:39:39.360 --> 1:39:42.480]  and then it's the most horrifying thing that you can read joe
[1:39:42.480 --> 1:39:45.280]  there's scientists there from the government who are saying who are
[1:39:45.280 --> 1:39:49.200]  reading the reports and saying we get this is undeniable
[1:39:49.200 --> 1:39:53.040]  absolutely what is robert kennedy jr talking about
[1:39:53.040 --> 1:39:58.000]  in 2000 and it's happened several other times congressman
[1:39:58.000 --> 1:40:02.560]  use congressional power to force cdc to release secret documents to them
[1:40:02.560 --> 1:40:07.600]  and then several congressmen who have brain damaged children and grandchildren
[1:40:07.600 --> 1:40:11.360]  released it even though they weren't supposed to this was classified and it
[1:40:11.360 --> 1:40:14.560]  was the heads of the cdc and the scientists saying
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:18.960]  i wouldn't give it to my grandchildren or my kids we've brain damaged millions
[1:40:18.960 --> 1:40:23.360]  and they say well we got to continue it we can't
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:28.880]  admit that we know this does this or we'll all go to prison
[1:40:28.880 --> 1:40:35.600]  now they then when that all came out in 2002 the documents were from 2000
[1:40:35.600 --> 1:40:41.120]  but it took two years for it to come out it was even on abc nightly news
[1:40:42.480 --> 1:40:47.280]  since then they've lied and said the mercury was taken out
[1:40:47.280 --> 1:40:51.760]  ladies and gentlemen under federal regulations vaccine makers
[1:40:51.760 --> 1:40:55.840]  are supposed to they don't always do this make a small
[1:40:55.840 --> 1:41:01.120]  amount of non-mercury vaccines
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:04.960]  so that's all that happens yes are there vaccines without mercury
[1:41:04.960 --> 1:41:09.680]  can the news hold up an insert of a vaccine that might be one percent of
[1:41:09.680 --> 1:41:12.480]  that type of vaccine that's out there it's even less than that the studies
[1:41:12.480 --> 1:41:16.480]  i've seen can you if you're andrea merkle of germany or
[1:41:16.480 --> 1:41:20.160]  gordon brown of england or barack obama and his
[1:41:20.160 --> 1:41:24.480]  daughters of usa can you get one that doesn't have mercury yes
[1:41:24.480 --> 1:41:28.000]  can you go to an office and order it if you know what to ask for
[1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:31.360]  they can order it you can come back a week later and be shot up with it
[1:41:31.360 --> 1:41:35.040]  it's still got the cancer viruses it's still got the rna
[1:41:35.040 --> 1:41:38.320]  it's still got the aluminum
[1:41:39.280 --> 1:41:43.280]  it's still all these foreign because it's not just the viruses they're
[1:41:43.280 --> 1:41:46.320]  breeding up on caterpillar eggs and baby retinas
[1:41:46.320 --> 1:41:51.520]  and dog kidneys or monkey kidneys that's the main things they use
[1:41:51.520 --> 1:41:54.640]  even most of the vaccine you hear about that's grown on eggs the original
[1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:58.400]  virus for the original sample the seed stock
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:04.000]  is grown in tissue and then it's brought over and put in eggs but
[1:42:04.000 --> 1:42:08.240]  it's growing the same thing you know i mean if i grow
[1:42:08.240 --> 1:42:12.000]  squash plants in a greenhouse and then take those plant seeds out of the
[1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:14.240]  greenhouse and go plant them out in the field
[1:42:14.240 --> 1:42:19.440]  or up against a fence row next year it's the same squash
[1:42:19.440 --> 1:42:22.960]  you understand that it's the same watermelons
[1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:27.200]  it's the same blueberries it's it's the same thing it's just their children
[1:42:27.200 --> 1:42:30.800]  but the exact same genetics
[1:42:31.040 --> 1:42:35.760]  and they know this they know this they know this
[1:42:35.760 --> 1:42:38.080]  and
[1:42:38.400 --> 1:42:43.520]  everyone is waking up now literally the vast majority over 70 percent in u.s
[1:42:43.520 --> 1:42:47.040]  polls think it's bad and don't want it
[1:42:47.040 --> 1:42:52.000]  but the media goes out and interviews 20 30 40 50 people till they find the one
[1:42:52.000 --> 1:42:57.440]  person that will say they like it and they put them on the news
[1:42:57.440 --> 1:43:02.560]  that's who they put on the news
[1:43:02.560 --> 1:43:05.680]  that's who they push
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:10.720]  and let me give you the news flash four years ago the associated press told the
[1:43:10.720 --> 1:43:14.320]  truth and reported and the article said we don't
[1:43:14.320 --> 1:43:21.520]  know why that all the major vaccine makers for hepatitis for flu for mmr
[1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:27.120]  increased mercury they didn't just put it back in
[1:43:27.120 --> 1:43:31.680]  they increased it not one fold not double
[1:43:31.680 --> 1:43:38.240]  not triple not quadruple five times what the mercury was before
[1:43:38.240 --> 1:43:43.040]  so before it was 400 times the safe level of mercury
[1:43:43.040 --> 1:43:48.240]  in a average one year round of shots for a five-year-old
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:51.680]  400 times for their body weight it's not quite as bad with an
[1:43:51.680 --> 1:43:55.920]  adult just like a big guy can drink more beer and not get drunk
[1:43:55.920 --> 1:43:59.200]  but for a child imagine a newborn baby giving three shots at birth
[1:43:59.200 --> 1:44:04.080]  then six months later five more shots then when they're 18 months more shots
[1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:08.160]  so i see these fake studies by the media and they're always deceptive five
[1:44:08.160 --> 1:44:11.120]  minutes you can prove they're alive going study shows
[1:44:11.120 --> 1:44:16.160]  kids are still getting autism even though mercury's out of the shots
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:19.920]  but then you go read the study the study was done with regular vaccines
[1:44:19.920 --> 1:44:23.200]  i mean ladies and gentlemen they lie and they lie
[1:44:23.200 --> 1:44:28.160]  and they lie and they lie and they lie and they lie
[1:44:28.160 --> 1:44:33.040]  but the good news here is on the federal reserve or on vaccines or on the war
[1:44:33.040 --> 1:44:37.200]  or on warrantless wiretapping or the police state in every poll
[1:44:37.200 --> 1:44:42.400]  the majority way over 70 percent are against all this
[1:44:42.400 --> 1:44:46.080]  we're the people this is our country
[1:44:46.720 --> 1:44:50.240]  you can't make us do all this so the good news is
[1:44:50.240 --> 1:44:54.080]  the momentum is shifting so the establishment is firing everything
[1:44:54.080 --> 1:44:56.720]  they've got at us in an attempt to make us
[1:44:56.720 --> 1:45:02.080]  capitulate and it's not going to work the police aren't bad
[1:45:02.080 --> 1:45:05.920]  most the fbi people aren't bad most of them are investigating bank robberies
[1:45:05.920 --> 1:45:08.960]  and kidnappings it's that higher up groups that are bad
[1:45:08.960 --> 1:45:11.760]  most people in banking aren't bad they're just giving you a home loan
[1:45:11.760 --> 1:45:16.800]  it's the big bankers up at the top most people in congress aren't bad they're
[1:45:16.800 --> 1:45:20.640]  just corrupt and whores and competitive so they sell out to be in
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:22.960]  power we have to get the message out about how
[1:45:22.960 --> 1:45:26.720]  bad this is if we continue along this line now listen
[1:45:26.720 --> 1:45:29.280]  i'm going to come back in the next segment the segment after that and get
[1:45:29.280 --> 1:45:32.960]  through this bank of callers have your questions and comments ready
[1:45:32.960 --> 1:45:36.720]  woody malcom raul eric derrick and hawaii and others
[1:45:36.720 --> 1:45:40.400]  but i wanted to bring ted anderson up and tomorrow i'm going to fish the clip
[1:45:40.400 --> 1:45:44.240]  out and play it
[1:45:44.240 --> 1:45:48.160]  ron paul said they tried to kill gold it didn't work and that's what mainstream
[1:45:48.160 --> 1:45:52.560]  news is reporting they put hundreds of billions of dollars i think i have the
[1:45:52.560 --> 1:45:56.400]  reuters article in my stack ted can fill a sin on it
[1:45:56.400 --> 1:45:59.440]  hundreds of billions of dollars what was it a 200 billion dollar buy
[1:45:59.440 --> 1:46:03.200]  they dumped this gold on the market leveraged its trillions
[1:46:03.200 --> 1:46:07.040]  thinking it would drive it down from above a thousand instead it shot up to
[1:46:07.040 --> 1:46:11.680]  1099 you heard it from ron paul who's an economist not
[1:46:11.680 --> 1:46:15.040]  just a medical doctor saying they're going to lose the war on gold
[1:46:15.040 --> 1:46:18.960]  he believes it's only going to go up i don't know
[1:46:18.960 --> 1:46:23.280]  but all the smart money is on it going up and at least as the dollar plunges
[1:46:23.280 --> 1:46:27.600]  and g20 meets to do it fully they can't kill gold because it's real
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:30.480]  they may be able to drive it down for a while doesn't look like that but it
[1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:33.760]  will always beach ball back up like pushing a beach ball to the bottom of
[1:46:33.760 --> 1:46:37.840]  the pool ted take us out to break
[1:46:37.840 --> 1:46:41.040]  with what ron paul was saying earlier about gold
[1:46:41.040 --> 1:46:44.640]  and then today's gold offer ted anderson of minus resources
[1:46:44.640 --> 1:46:48.400]  well alex they've been playing those tricks i mean going all the way back to
[1:46:48.400 --> 1:46:52.400]  the middle 1980s and we went to our market peak
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:57.600]  in 1980 where gold hit eight hundred dollars an ounce silver hit fifty dollars
[1:46:57.600 --> 1:47:01.440]  an ounce and then it started backing off down into 1982
[1:47:01.440 --> 1:47:05.200]  the central banks of the world unitedly
[1:47:05.200 --> 1:47:09.920]  had tried to suppress the market price of gold and keep it below four hundred
[1:47:09.920 --> 1:47:14.080]  dollars an ounce for the longest time anybody that wants to have information
[1:47:14.080 --> 1:47:16.480]  on that can find it it's not like it's hidden
[1:47:16.480 --> 1:47:25.200]  you can go right over to gata or gata dot org that's gata dot org
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:28.480]  now the latest thing is i mean they do postings up there
[1:47:28.480 --> 1:47:32.960]  for just you know just recently as well and honestly i mean that's what i mean
[1:47:32.960 --> 1:47:36.880]  when i say with that when the gold prices drop down
[1:47:36.880 --> 1:47:41.920]  and i'm able to buy in in those dips usually most of the time that is
[1:47:41.920 --> 1:47:45.680]  occurring here in the new york market and the reason why it's happening is
[1:47:45.680 --> 1:47:49.360]  because the federal reserve system has such a
[1:47:49.360 --> 1:47:52.480]  heavy interest in seeing the united states dollar
[1:47:52.480 --> 1:47:58.480]  stay strong and gold stays suppressed see it's it's the game of the fiat
[1:47:58.480 --> 1:48:03.360]  currency makers is to try to keep you out of anything that it stands in the way
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:07.760]  of of their profit-making machine and i and i have to say
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:12.800]  that it is one insidious profit-making machine because they have
[1:48:12.800 --> 1:48:16.080]  legal tender laws pointing at them that allows them
[1:48:16.080 --> 1:48:20.560]  to create the currency of the nation and they lend it to us and we have to
[1:48:20.560 --> 1:48:25.760]  serve us interest on that debt now you have to realize what that means i mean
[1:48:25.760 --> 1:48:29.920]  what has our country been doing here for the last at least 30 years
[1:48:29.920 --> 1:48:35.280]  is deficit spending so what it where does deficit spending
[1:48:35.280 --> 1:48:39.680]  who doesn't help and who doesn't hurt well the united states people
[1:48:39.680 --> 1:48:43.520]  have to go into debt to get the currency and you can see that the united
[1:48:43.520 --> 1:48:46.880]  states government has done nothing but deficit spending
[1:48:46.880 --> 1:48:51.760]  and put the taxpayers on on the hook for even more and more and more of their
[1:48:51.760 --> 1:48:56.080]  hard-earned wages and that money eventually filters right back up to
[1:48:56.080 --> 1:49:01.120]  this elite banking system and they have control of the world
[1:49:01.120 --> 1:49:04.880]  i mean when bill clinton was in office he would be telling you that this is
[1:49:04.880 --> 1:49:07.760]  going to happen in the economy and that and so on and so forth it was one of
[1:49:07.760 --> 1:49:12.160]  the few surpluses that we ever ran but back then the united
[1:49:12.160 --> 1:49:16.240]  states people were going so far into debt that the government didn't have to
[1:49:16.240 --> 1:49:20.640]  you know there just has never been a time since 1913
[1:49:20.640 --> 1:49:24.240]  that the united states of america has been able to enjoy
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:27.920]  prosperity without having the equivalent
[1:49:27.920 --> 1:49:32.080]  increase in the debt and it's so it just puts people on the hook
[1:49:32.080 --> 1:49:36.640]  you know to to to such an extreme it's ridiculous and we have the very
[1:49:36.640 --> 1:49:40.480]  parasites that have engineered this not getting in trouble
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:45.920]  but getting even more power now they're getting the bailout money alex
[1:49:45.920 --> 1:49:49.520]  were having to even go further into this to give them the bailout money
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:53.120]  which isn't bailout money they're using that to not loan
[1:49:53.120 --> 1:49:56.000]  and buy up real assets and they're bragging about it it's come out in
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:50:00.000]  the clatching newspapers the goldman sac secretly bet
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:02.880]  on the u.s housing crash to bring down their competitors
[1:50:02.880 --> 1:50:07.440]  i mean this is a criminal group ted tell folks do you still have gold that you
[1:50:07.440 --> 1:50:11.600]  bought in the 920 market as it's up in
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:14.720]  i mean that you know let me let me say it this way alex
[1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:18.400]  excuse me ted hold on just a second i was getting the numbers wrong
[1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:21.840]  there because i end up talking so fast you get that number right
[1:50:21.840 --> 1:50:26.000]  you still have gold at the 1020 level of when you bought into the market
[1:50:26.000 --> 1:50:30.560]  with it now up at 1090 yeah that's exactly what is that's that's that's the
[1:50:30.560 --> 1:50:35.280]  way to say it truthfully i have frank's currently right now at 238
[1:50:35.280 --> 1:50:40.160]  i've british sovereigns at 293 i have walking liberty halves right now at
[1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:44.160]  eight dollars and 69 cents and i'm also carrying the Lakota nation
[1:50:44.160 --> 1:50:48.160]  rounds at 22 dollars and 30 cents stay there ted
[1:50:48.160 --> 1:50:51.600]  because i was just thinking back to two weeks ago when it was at nine something
[1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:56.240]  again 1020 is now a super low that ted bought it
[1:50:56.240 --> 1:51:01.120]  and it's up at 1090 i mean just get my mind wrapped around that
[1:51:01.120 --> 1:51:04.640]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[1:51:04.640 --> 1:51:08.000]  non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:11.760]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable
[1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:14.640]  than silver or gold it's true seeds have outperformed even
[1:51:14.640 --> 1:51:17.840]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[1:51:17.840 --> 1:51:20.720]  again so our friends at solutions from science
[1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:23.840]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:27.360]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce

[1:54:14.800 --> 1:54:18.240]  you heard ron paul earlier say that he believes gold's only going to continue
[1:54:18.240 --> 1:54:22.480]  to explode upward the imf sells billions and billions in gold
[1:54:22.480 --> 1:54:24.960]  trying to drive it down like they've done the last few years
[1:54:24.960 --> 1:54:29.680]  it explodes and i believe ron paul's right they are failing
[1:54:29.680 --> 1:54:33.360]  well they admit they're failing to drive it down
[1:54:33.360 --> 1:54:37.040]  uh ted again tell people the offer you've got so you've almost run out of
[1:54:37.040 --> 1:54:41.600]  gold you bought at the 1020 level that sounds high but it's actually low
[1:54:41.600 --> 1:54:47.120]  and it's up at 1090 right now pushed up to 199 1099
[1:54:47.120 --> 1:54:50.080]  yesterday fire out the number for folks that want to call
[1:54:50.080 --> 1:54:54.080]  and talk to the brokers and order some silver and gold coins at great prices
[1:54:54.080 --> 1:55:04.000]  yeah the number is 1-800-686-2237 again it's 1-800-686-2237 and ron paul's
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:07.520]  exactly right they create these little opportunities for me to buy
[1:55:07.520 --> 1:55:10.880]  gold law they sell their gold they try to suppress it they're
[1:55:10.880 --> 1:55:14.960]  trying to keep people away from gold but they are losing in that battle
[1:55:14.960 --> 1:55:18.240]  and the reason is because the world wants to get away from the dollar so
[1:55:18.240 --> 1:55:21.680]  every time they start selling the rest of the world starts buying
[1:55:21.680 --> 1:55:25.360]  because they want to get rid of their dollars and grab up the gold this is
[1:55:25.360 --> 1:55:28.640]  always worked in the past for them it's not working now
[1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:31.920]  folks the globalists are obsessed with gold and silver

[1:56:45.440 --> 1:56:49.440]  his mouth as he's reading his bill is the word classified
[1:56:49.440 --> 1:56:52.800]  and it's homeland security funding appropriations bill
[1:56:52.800 --> 1:56:57.520]  and it's designed in the event of some type of attack all right let me stop you
[1:56:57.520 --> 1:57:00.800]  let me stop you there are real executive orders
[1:57:00.800 --> 1:57:05.360]  presidential decision directive 51 john warner defense authorization act but
[1:57:05.360 --> 1:57:10.400]  what the onion did is they right after that broke last year
[1:57:10.400 --> 1:57:13.840]  and real congressman went to the floor and said
[1:57:13.840 --> 1:57:18.800]  basically what the onion video says the onion newspaper puts out fake news
[1:57:18.800 --> 1:57:22.720]  they almost copied it word for word and put the onion on it
[1:57:22.720 --> 1:57:27.360]  to discredit it so that's not real but in the obama deception
[1:57:27.360 --> 1:57:31.040]  we have the real clips of them talking about that
[1:57:31.040 --> 1:57:35.360]  so i get these calls every week now and people put
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:39.040]  flu executive order on it again to fool people
[1:57:39.040 --> 1:57:42.400]  look at the lower right hand corner there's an onion there
[1:57:42.400 --> 1:57:47.520]  do you know about the onion newspaper yes so and you're not bad woody they
[1:57:47.520 --> 1:57:51.120]  just fooled you this is the type of diabolical crap
[1:57:51.120 --> 1:57:54.400]  they do and i appreciate your call
[1:57:54.960 --> 1:57:59.920]  here we have john warner defense authorization act pdd 51 for martial law
[1:57:59.920 --> 1:58:05.440]  the president to become a dictator all these real congressman senator inhofe
[1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:11.760]  all these real people congressman domenici coming out about it
[1:58:11.760 --> 1:58:17.760]  talking about real things and then all anyone talks about is the
[1:58:17.760 --> 1:58:22.720]  onion with its fake and that's what co until pro does i'm not
[1:58:22.720 --> 1:58:25.760]  seeing the onions go until pro but they might as well get a paycheck from the
[1:58:25.760 --> 1:58:28.800]  government because now anytime you talk about
[1:58:28.800 --> 1:58:32.320]  martial law legislation that's public no one will look at it
[1:58:32.320 --> 1:58:36.080]  they'll pull the onion out throw it right in your face
[1:58:36.080 --> 1:58:39.600]  that's how black ops works

[2:00:31.680 --> 2:00:37.120]  or really setting up fema camps or any other issue as they put out fake stories
[2:00:37.120 --> 2:00:40.960]  to then discredit all the real ones that's what glenbeck does
[2:00:40.960 --> 2:00:45.280]  i'm not attacking glenbeck it's just a fact he does it
[2:00:45.280 --> 2:00:48.800]  that's how he discredited fema camps even though they're all admitted
[2:00:48.800 --> 2:00:52.560]  let's go to malcom in texas malcom you're on the air
[2:00:52.560 --> 2:00:57.840]  hi alex how you doing good i saw your film followed the republic loved it
[2:00:57.840 --> 2:01:02.000]  sent copy south to friends and relatives two people were shocked by it got no
[2:01:02.000 --> 2:01:05.760]  other responses but overall it was a great great film
[2:01:05.760 --> 2:01:10.960]  loved it well thank you sure have a question for you i was hoping to ask
[2:01:10.960 --> 2:01:13.600]  ron paul this because it's sort of concerned him
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:20.640]  um in 1966 alan greenspan wrote an article when he was with an rand secret
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:26.080]  society and it was republished and it was republished in a
[2:01:26.080 --> 2:01:29.600]  compendium book she put out where he talked about gold
[2:01:29.600 --> 2:01:33.200]  put down the federal reserve and that's why they came and then hired green span
[2:01:33.200 --> 2:01:38.720]  away right well the story that i've heard this in the 1980s i was in
[2:01:38.720 --> 2:01:42.480]  many years ago um studied economics and stuff
[2:01:42.480 --> 2:01:46.960]  uh i've heard stories i'm not sure it's true hoping you could verify this
[2:01:46.960 --> 2:01:49.760]  and i was actually hoping ron paul could verify this
[2:01:49.760 --> 2:01:53.760]  uh ron paul got an actual copy of the original treatise that greenspan wrote
[2:01:53.760 --> 2:01:57.680]  and got him to autograph it and when he asked him if he believed in it
[2:01:57.680 --> 2:02:00.800]  after he autographed the greenspan looked at him in the eye and said
[2:02:00.800 --> 2:02:04.640]  absolutely i would not change a single word in it
[2:02:04.640 --> 2:02:09.200]  and my question was i mean i've heard this in the 1980s and i'm not sure if it's
[2:02:09.200 --> 2:02:11.520]  true and you're gonna probably disagree with me
[2:02:11.520 --> 2:02:15.520]  but is it possible that with alan greenspan being appointed by ronald
[2:02:15.520 --> 2:02:18.720]  reagan who was pro gold standard in the original
[2:02:18.720 --> 2:02:22.240]  when he was uh before he got shot by hinkley and stuff
[2:02:22.240 --> 2:02:27.440]  is it possible that alan greenspan his whole mess that he created the
[2:02:27.440 --> 2:02:31.440]  incredible inflation he generated the removal of glass the equal all of that
[2:02:31.440 --> 2:02:35.280]  is it possible that he was trying to force us to go back
[2:02:35.280 --> 2:02:38.960]  to the gold standard kicking and screaming like he said he was going to
[2:02:38.960 --> 2:02:43.200]  do when he was with an rand's little group
[2:02:43.200 --> 2:02:47.840]  well the problem is the bankers wouldn't have put him in
[2:02:47.840 --> 2:02:53.600]  uh if he was some secret operative of somebody else i mean we know
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:57.360]  that greenspan was just the chairman of the fed that's really a front
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:00.480]  organization the real powers the chairman of the new york
[2:03:00.480 --> 2:03:04.640]  fed and and and really it's just speculation i judge a tree by its fruits
[2:03:04.640 --> 2:03:08.160]  in the 70s green spamming over to the dark side
[2:03:08.160 --> 2:03:13.440]  uh and so we know he's bad but certainly big central banks have been
[2:03:13.440 --> 2:03:17.440]  hoarding gold and they are talking about having a final global currency
[2:03:17.440 --> 2:03:21.280]  as ron paul said last hour that is partially gold backed
[2:03:21.280 --> 2:03:24.400]  because they're going to be holding all the gold that's why i differ a bit with
[2:03:24.400 --> 2:03:26.720]  ron paul about trying to go back to gold and he's
[2:03:26.720 --> 2:03:31.120]  even said you can't do it automatically because it's all held
[2:03:31.120 --> 2:03:35.120]  predominantly some individuals have small amounts but it's held predominantly
[2:03:35.120 --> 2:03:38.080]  by the elites that's why we protect ourselves by
[2:03:38.080 --> 2:03:42.160]  getting gold and silver uh but uh it is true i mean i don't
[2:03:42.160 --> 2:03:45.360]  need to ask greenspan of a minute he wrote it
[2:03:45.360 --> 2:03:49.040]  he he he he criticized the fellow reserve he called for a gold standard
[2:03:49.040 --> 2:03:51.360]  he criticized fractional reserve banking i've
[2:03:51.360 --> 2:03:57.200]  i've read the essay so that's basically it
[2:03:57.200 --> 2:04:01.200]  but i've always heard that anran secret group wanted their missions
[2:04:01.200 --> 2:04:04.800]  and he was a big worshiper of anran at the time
[2:04:04.800 --> 2:04:09.600]  one of the big missions was to get rid of the federal reserve
[2:04:09.600 --> 2:04:13.120]  bring back gold as our current as our money
[2:04:13.120 --> 2:04:17.680]  and to bring back true economic freedom by any means necessary
[2:04:17.680 --> 2:04:21.920]  and yeah i i've heard the argument that alan greenspan went to the dark side
[2:04:21.920 --> 2:04:25.920]  and so forth but what if it there was some secret agenda
[2:04:25.920 --> 2:04:28.720]  all along and he just this was like a big act
[2:04:28.720 --> 2:04:33.280]  yeah what if what if uh what if santa claus is real
[2:04:33.280 --> 2:04:35.600]  i mean i think there's i think there's a lot better chance than what you're
[2:04:35.600 --> 2:04:38.720]  saying is true than if santa claus and the elves are real
[2:04:38.720 --> 2:04:43.360]  it's just i don't do a lot of speculating i sit here
[2:04:43.360 --> 2:04:46.240]  and i cover the facts we need to get rid of the fellow reserve
[2:04:46.240 --> 2:04:50.800]  get the congress back under control of monetary policy
[2:04:50.800 --> 2:04:54.240]  and i don't believe we should go back to a pure gold standard because that could
[2:04:54.240 --> 2:04:57.920]  be manipulated we need monetary control and education of the public
[2:04:57.920 --> 2:05:00.560]  and to get rid of fractional reserve banking thank you
[2:05:00.560 --> 2:05:03.920]  have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power
[2:05:03.920 --> 2:05:07.520]  if so this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear
[2:05:07.520 --> 2:05:11.120]  solar powered generators are now available from solutions from science in
[2:05:11.120 --> 2:05:13.760]  toms in illinois these emergency backup systems
[2:05:13.760 --> 2:05:16.640]  provide lifesaving electrical power when you need it most
[2:05:16.640 --> 2:05:19.840]  unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly
[2:05:19.840 --> 2:05:23.840]  emits no fumes and produces electricity for free it's like having an electric
[2:05:23.840 --> 2:05:27.440]  power plant running quietly in your own home run some pumps
[2:05:27.440 --> 2:05:31.200]  shortwave radios computers and even keep food from spoiling
[2:05:31.200 --> 2:05:34.640]  whether it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts or blackouts
[2:05:34.640 --> 2:05:37.760]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[2:05:37.760 --> 2:05:41.920]  when the power goes out you'll be ready with a solar powered generator from

[2:08:10.560 --> 2:08:15.360]  we have laurence j kotlakov professor of economics boston university
[2:08:15.360 --> 2:08:18.960]  research associate the national bureau of economic research president
[2:08:18.960 --> 2:08:25.360]  economic security planning ink joining us today we're honored to have him and
[2:08:25.360 --> 2:08:30.000]  tomorrow and throughout next week we're having the different economists on to
[2:08:30.000 --> 2:08:33.360]  get their different perspectives and views from this article
[2:08:33.360 --> 2:08:38.080]  because this is the best article i've read putting it all in context from the
[2:08:38.080 --> 2:08:42.400]  scores of economists and uh federal regulators former federal
[2:08:42.400 --> 2:08:45.840]  regulators we've had on like professor black
[2:08:45.840 --> 2:08:49.440]  and many others here on the syndicated radio broadcast
[2:08:49.440 --> 2:08:53.280]  but the article is mclatchy a newspaper syndicated
[2:08:53.280 --> 2:08:57.120]  by greg gordon how goldman secretly bet on the u.s
[2:08:57.120 --> 2:09:01.280]  housing crash and the findings of the reporter who's
[2:09:01.280 --> 2:09:04.800]  an award-winning reporter formerly of the new york times
[2:09:04.800 --> 2:09:09.680]  is and he got a lot of secret perspectives and memorandums from
[2:09:09.680 --> 2:09:13.680]  goldman sacks that are quoted here this is some explosive stuff
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:18.160]  that they secretly bet against housing stocks knowing they were going to go
[2:09:18.160 --> 2:09:21.360]  under and that they wanted to do this in part for huge profits
[2:09:21.360 --> 2:09:25.600]  but to also destroy bear sterns in competition they had their key people
[2:09:25.600 --> 2:09:28.480]  and revolving doors in federal regulatory positions
[2:09:28.480 --> 2:09:34.320]  from treasury to the federal reserve everywhere uh so an inside job and the
[2:09:34.320 --> 2:09:37.920]  article is just so important i've been talking about it since
[2:09:37.920 --> 2:09:41.360]  nine days ago ten days ago when it came out not this sunday but last sunday
[2:09:41.360 --> 2:09:46.240]  and quoted in here a professor kotlakov says
[2:09:46.240 --> 2:09:48.960]  the securities and exchange commission should be very interested in any
[2:09:48.960 --> 2:09:54.160]  financial company that secretly decides a financial product as a loser and then
[2:09:54.160 --> 2:09:57.760]  goes out and actively markets the product are very similarly product
[2:09:57.760 --> 2:10:00.800]  unsuspecting customers without disclosing its true opinion
[2:10:00.800 --> 2:10:04.000]  said laurence kotlakov a boston university economics professor who's
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:07.120]  proposed a massive overhaul the nation's banks this is fraud and should be
[2:10:07.120 --> 2:10:12.240]  prosecuted he now he's saying in here if this writer's research is correct
[2:10:12.240 --> 2:10:15.680]  uh and from and from all the other people we've had on in the internal
[2:10:15.680 --> 2:10:20.880]  documents it looks like it is uh so it's great to have you on with us professor
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:26.880]  yeah you know i i i uh the the statement this is fraud and should be
[2:10:26.880 --> 2:10:31.120]  prosecuted with uh i think i said if this turns out to be the case it's
[2:10:31.120 --> 2:10:34.800]  it is fraud i didn't say this is fraud i i wasn't referring to what they
[2:10:34.800 --> 2:10:38.080]  actually we don't i don't know for sure that golden actually violated any
[2:10:38.080 --> 2:10:43.600]  securities laws and uh i don't know that they didn't so uh that's all i
[2:10:43.600 --> 2:10:47.440]  know you're saying if what greg gordon's saying at mclatchy
[2:10:47.440 --> 2:10:51.520]  and this guy's got a great record if what you're saying is true and i don't
[2:10:51.520 --> 2:10:53.760]  think mclatchy would let him run with this if there wasn't a lot of
[2:10:53.760 --> 2:10:56.560]  where there's smoke there's fire but regardless you're saying if this is
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:11:01.440]  true it's fraud if what he alleges what he alleges uh
[2:11:01.440 --> 2:11:05.840]  sounds like fraudulent behavior i think uh or at least uh
[2:11:05.840 --> 2:11:09.120]  you know some form of financial malfeasance but
[2:11:09.120 --> 2:11:15.200]  you just don't uh sell things to people that you don't uh
[2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:18.240]  what where you're putting where you're saying they're x and they're actually
[2:11:18.240 --> 2:11:21.040]  y that's you know that's one of the major problems
[2:11:21.040 --> 2:11:24.480]  associated with this entire financial debacle which is we've had people
[2:11:24.480 --> 2:11:29.120]  selling snake oil and uh claiming that it was uh
[2:11:29.120 --> 2:11:33.440]  you know great for your health you know claiming was penicillin when it's
[2:11:33.440 --> 2:11:37.760]  actually a snake oil making people sick financially speaking so
[2:11:37.760 --> 2:11:42.400]  we need to have a brand new financial system that's what i call for in my
[2:11:42.400 --> 2:11:45.600]  i've got a book that it's coming out in march with
[2:11:45.600 --> 2:11:49.840]  wiley called jimmy steward is dead and it's a
[2:11:49.840 --> 2:11:53.040]  it talks about how to fix the financial system from bottom up
[2:11:53.040 --> 2:11:59.360]  very simply which is to make all the financial companies corporations
[2:11:59.360 --> 2:12:03.280]  operate as paths through mutual fund companies just like fidelity
[2:12:03.280 --> 2:12:08.560]  investments or ti craft many large financial
[2:12:08.560 --> 2:12:13.200]  mutual fund companies and those companies are the only part of the financial
[2:12:13.200 --> 2:12:17.760]  system that's still standing because they weren't barring money
[2:12:17.760 --> 2:12:21.600]  to engage in risky gambles and leave the taxpayer
[2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:25.440]  to pay the bill so what they were doing is just
[2:12:25.440 --> 2:12:29.840]  intermediating they were taking in money into the mutual funds and then buying
[2:12:29.840 --> 2:12:34.000]  the kinds of assets that those investors in the mutual funds wanted to
[2:12:34.000 --> 2:12:38.240]  hold so that's the way we need to run our financial system
[2:12:38.240 --> 2:12:41.920]  on the basis of mutual funds and by the way i'm not
[2:12:41.920 --> 2:12:45.360]  employed by any mutual fund company or anything like that
[2:12:45.360 --> 2:12:48.320]  so this is just my own view and many other economists are coming around to
[2:12:48.320 --> 2:12:51.120]  this view and some top government officials in different
[2:12:51.120 --> 2:12:56.320]  countries are coming around to this view so it's the way to really run our
[2:12:56.320 --> 2:13:00.320]  modern financial system without going back to 1930
[2:13:00.320 --> 2:13:03.680]  where we can't return to that the reason the book says
[2:13:03.680 --> 2:13:07.120]  title is jimmy steward is dead is that you can't go back
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:11.200]  to that kind of environment and you're not going to have
[2:13:11.200 --> 2:13:18.320]  trustworthy bankers we've seen that for sure so you need to have a new system
[2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:22.480]  that makes sure that we can't be taken that the public can't be taken well
[2:13:22.480 --> 2:13:25.920]  well larry they can take your proposal or other similar proposals
[2:13:25.920 --> 2:13:30.720]  the problem is goldman sacks and other top you know investment groups and
[2:13:30.720 --> 2:13:35.040]  brokerage firms and investment banks have their people at every level in
[2:13:35.040 --> 2:13:37.520]  almost every regulatory position and government
[2:13:37.520 --> 2:13:43.680]  and quasi government position and so they can selectively enforce any rules
[2:13:43.680 --> 2:13:46.880]  they want in fact we're hearing about this new bank of the world that'll have
[2:13:46.880 --> 2:13:53.200]  regulatory power and it'll knock heads to stop you know these types of abuses
[2:13:53.200 --> 2:13:55.600]  but the people that are going to be knocking the heads are a bunch of
[2:13:55.600 --> 2:13:59.440]  goldman sacks goons well let's not call them goons
[2:13:59.440 --> 2:14:03.200]  because we don't know you know they're uh
[2:14:03.200 --> 2:14:08.080]  they're people just like we are they're they're uh and we
[2:14:08.080 --> 2:14:12.000]  let's not cast dispersions to these people we we don't know
[2:14:12.000 --> 2:14:18.720]  and there's all kinds of uh uh and wall street is a term that refers to
[2:14:18.720 --> 2:14:23.040]  not just that part of new york city but all all part all parts of the
[2:14:23.040 --> 2:14:26.560]  financial system worldwide you've had people in
[2:14:26.560 --> 2:14:30.560]  singapore ring down a bearing bearing brat bank which was about a
[2:14:30.560 --> 2:14:33.760]  400 year old bank uh there was a french road
[2:14:33.760 --> 2:14:38.080]  road trader brought down society general almost destroyed the third largest
[2:14:38.080 --> 2:14:44.560]  bank in france so this is a global problem and you know it's
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:48.160]  true that the financial community isn't going to like what i have to say
[2:14:48.160 --> 2:14:50.800]  when they hear about it on the other hand they're not going to like what
[2:14:50.800 --> 2:14:56.800]  they're going to get hit with uh by the the regulators which is 90
[2:14:56.800 --> 2:15:00.720]  percent cuts in salary in some cases and the fed is now
[2:15:00.720 --> 2:15:05.120]  you know sending a plan to uh oversee compensation in different firms
[2:15:05.120 --> 2:15:08.720]  probably including golden sacks so well i want to go over that but but from
[2:15:08.720 --> 2:15:12.560]  your research professor who are the bad guys i mean bill clinton got rid of
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:15.600]  last eagle the congress went along with it
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:20.800]  uh well the there's a there's a variety of problems here there's
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:25.840]  basically uh uh a fundamental moral hazard problem
[2:15:25.840 --> 2:15:31.360]  here where uh where financial uh companies are
[2:15:31.360 --> 2:15:36.400]  are playing poker with the taxpayers chips that's the fundamental problem
[2:15:36.400 --> 2:15:40.240]  here which is that uh they're going to the casino with our money
[2:15:40.240 --> 2:15:44.080]  and not uh they're not so there's that problem there's the
[2:15:44.080 --> 2:15:48.480]  too big to fail problem there's the the um the fact that
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:51.760]  the companies are being run by the management not by the shareholders
[2:15:51.760 --> 2:15:54.240]  because the shareholders are dispersed so there's a corporate governance
[2:15:54.240 --> 2:15:58.960]  problem there's a fraud problem which is that uh
[2:15:58.960 --> 2:16:02.160]  people left right and center were issuing mortgages
[2:16:02.160 --> 2:16:06.560]  and uh lying about the uh income and not verifying that
[2:16:06.560 --> 2:16:12.080]  the collateral values so and what liar mortgages should not exist
[2:16:12.080 --> 2:16:15.440]  uh and they're going to continue and there was a rating the rating companies
[2:16:15.440 --> 2:16:20.320]  were in effect being effectively bribed by uh the people that they were
[2:16:20.320 --> 2:16:25.040]  that were paying for the ratings you had the insurance so systemic fraud across
[2:16:25.040 --> 2:16:28.400]  the board the insurance i mean let me just read you a system is basically
[2:16:28.400 --> 2:16:31.920]  corrupt and uh i think that's a fair statement
[2:16:31.920 --> 2:16:36.480]  and we have to come up with a system that that's foolproof that has firewalls
[2:16:36.480 --> 2:16:42.160]  that doesn't permit uh the potential for systemic collapse like we've seen
[2:16:42.160 --> 2:16:47.920]  well how are a bunch of goldman sacks former executives and heads i mean
[2:16:47.920 --> 2:16:51.600]  reuters had an article today pointing out almost everybody
[2:16:51.600 --> 2:16:54.640]  who isn't former goldman sacks in power positions
[2:16:54.640 --> 2:16:57.760]  over regulatory systems i mean it's hard to name
[2:16:57.760 --> 2:17:01.680]  a a number one person a number one man or woman
[2:17:01.680 --> 2:17:06.000]  in a power position who isn't goldman sacks or a former director
[2:17:06.000 --> 2:17:09.600]  i mean you go over the list it just goes on and on and i want to read to you
[2:17:09.600 --> 2:17:14.320]  professor out of this article it says mclatchy inquiry found
[2:17:14.320 --> 2:17:19.840]  that goldman sacks bought and converted into high yield bonds tens of thousands
[2:17:19.840 --> 2:17:24.160]  of mortgages from some pride lenders that became the subjects of fbi
[2:17:24.160 --> 2:17:27.120]  investigations and the whether they misled borrowers
[2:17:27.120 --> 2:17:30.960]  or exaggerated applicants incomes and justifying making hefty
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:35.280]  fines it says the piece together goldman's role in the subprime meltdown
[2:17:35.280 --> 2:17:40.000]  mclatchy reviewed hundreds of documents sec filings copies of secret
[2:17:40.000 --> 2:17:43.520]  investment circulars lawsuits and interviewed numerous people familiar
[2:17:43.520 --> 2:17:47.360]  with the firm's activities that they used offshore tax havens to shuffle the
[2:17:47.360 --> 2:17:50.400]  mortgage backed securities the institutions worldwide including
[2:17:50.400 --> 2:17:53.840]  european and asian banks often in secret deals run through the cayman islands
[2:17:53.840 --> 2:17:58.080]  and british territory of caribbean that companies used to bypass us
[2:17:58.080 --> 2:18:02.560]  disclosure okay okay i get the point but you got to realize that those statements
[2:18:02.560 --> 2:18:06.000]  you know uh craig's making statements that are
[2:18:06.000 --> 2:18:10.320]  general statements uh they may be quite true they may not be
[2:18:10.320 --> 2:18:14.080]  fully true who knows but those statements can be made of
[2:18:14.080 --> 2:18:17.040]  virtually every major company that's gotten into trouble
[2:18:17.040 --> 2:18:20.800]  they all had offshore operations they were all
[2:18:20.800 --> 2:18:26.960]  engaged in one level or another in uh in uh in marketing securities uh
[2:18:26.960 --> 2:18:34.640]  who's uh underlying uh uh you know truths were not as uh
[2:18:34.640 --> 2:18:38.640]  disclosed they weren't disclosing to fully they may not have known
[2:18:38.640 --> 2:18:42.080]  themselves uh whether the statements on these mortgage
[2:18:42.080 --> 2:18:46.160]  applications were were true or not we we know that the whole
[2:18:46.160 --> 2:18:49.680]  system did not work i think we have to stop
[2:18:49.680 --> 2:18:53.520]  handing out shelling out money to these big companies i mean what what can we do
[2:18:53.520 --> 2:18:57.520]  to now we know what's happened what can we do at the margin to fix things

[2:24:06.480 --> 2:24:11.680]  until about 40 after professor laurence j kotlakov is our guest
[2:24:11.680 --> 2:24:15.200]  professor of economics boss in university got a book coming out with a
[2:24:15.200 --> 2:24:17.680]  great title jimmy steward is dead
[2:24:17.680 --> 2:24:23.920]  boy is he jimmy steward was a neat guy
[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:28.320]  going back to uh going back to our guest okay so sir your
[2:24:28.320 --> 2:24:31.600]  yours tell us what you think should have happened last year
[2:24:31.600 --> 2:24:36.000]  instead of the looting and giving more power to the very banks and
[2:24:36.000 --> 2:24:42.240]  and regulators that swindled us right uh we need to set up a system that's
[2:24:42.240 --> 2:24:49.040]  simple transparent and safe for public use and this current
[2:24:49.040 --> 2:24:52.720]  system is not and we are spending our way into
[2:24:52.720 --> 2:24:56.400]  what could be a huge problem hyperinflation potentially i mean
[2:24:56.400 --> 2:24:59.680]  the potential is really quite substantial for
[2:24:59.680 --> 2:25:04.960]  things to get at at a control the the way to get to safety is you set up a
[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:11.440]  federal a single federal regulatory body not 115 or 20 which is what we are
[2:25:11.440 --> 2:25:15.120]  we now have about 115 the president's been calling for about another
[2:25:15.120 --> 2:25:19.200]  five or so uh you know none of these guys could shoot
[2:25:19.200 --> 2:25:25.120]  straight to see the problem and uh what we just need is to have a system
[2:25:25.120 --> 2:25:30.000]  to set up that can't fail like the current system has so you set up a
[2:25:30.000 --> 2:25:37.440]  federal regulator to disclose verify rate and provide all this
[2:25:37.440 --> 2:25:41.200]  information about the securities and then you transform all the financial
[2:25:41.200 --> 2:25:45.520]  corporations into pass through mutual fund companies so that no bank can
[2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:47.840]  actually under this proposal which is called limited
[2:25:47.840 --> 2:25:51.040]  purpose banking can actually borrow money
[2:25:51.040 --> 2:25:54.080]  to invest in risky securities what they can do
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:25:58.080]  is they can set up mutual funds for us to invest in
[2:25:58.080 --> 2:26:01.520]  will buy shares the mutual funds and then the mutual funds will invest in
[2:26:01.520 --> 2:26:05.680]  things like mortgages or commercial paper from companies
[2:26:05.680 --> 2:26:09.360]  or stocks uh foreign stocks as well as domestic stocks
[2:26:09.360 --> 2:26:12.960]  we have to realize that a third of our financial system already is
[2:26:12.960 --> 2:26:16.880]  really the mutual fund industry they hold about 12 trillion dollars in asset
[2:26:16.880 --> 2:26:21.360]  so the glass is plenty full with respect to mutual fund
[2:26:21.360 --> 2:26:25.360]  companies being able to intermediate between
[2:26:25.360 --> 2:26:28.960]  lenders and borrowers and between savers and investors
[2:26:28.960 --> 2:26:35.680]  so the idea is not just to turn banks into mutual funds
[2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:40.080]  past your mutual fund companies that are never in a net exposed position where
[2:26:40.080 --> 2:26:44.080]  they're never you know if you're not borrowing to invest in risky assets you
[2:26:44.080 --> 2:26:48.400]  can never go under because of a decline in the value
[2:26:48.400 --> 2:26:51.760]  of your assets you're just not exposed
[2:26:51.760 --> 2:26:55.520]  so we're talking about zero net exposure of the banking system but we're also
[2:26:55.520 --> 2:26:59.200]  talking about the insurance industry being treated identically as banks
[2:26:59.200 --> 2:27:03.120]  because insurance companies as we've seen are engaged in
[2:27:03.120 --> 2:27:09.920]  the same kind of security transactions that are banks
[2:27:09.920 --> 2:27:13.120]  you can't really tell the difference between
[2:27:13.120 --> 2:27:16.720]  a financial instrument and an insurance policy they're very
[2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:20.400]  you know very similar to essentially identical
[2:27:20.400 --> 2:27:24.320]  financial instruments so what we need to do is make the insurance companies run
[2:27:24.320 --> 2:27:27.280]  as past your mutual fund companies as well
[2:27:27.280 --> 2:27:33.360]  and they would sell mutual funds that would allow us to buy
[2:27:33.360 --> 2:27:37.120]  life insurance policies through the mutual funds and even
[2:27:37.120 --> 2:27:41.360]  even buy cds security through mutual funds
[2:27:41.360 --> 2:27:45.440]  here's a professor let me ask you this then what is the plan
[2:27:45.440 --> 2:27:49.280]  or what looks like the dominant re-regulation that's being set up
[2:27:49.280 --> 2:27:53.040]  now because from what i've read in the newspapers
[2:27:53.040 --> 2:27:56.320]  i'm not trying to pick on the precious goldman sacks here but it
[2:27:56.320 --> 2:28:00.960]  i mean even reuters has pointed out they are the most represented in government
[2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:05.680]  and in the regulatory system with henry polson getting up and admitting that
[2:28:05.680 --> 2:28:09.040]  that you know that he that he that it's not a conflict of interest because the
[2:28:09.040 --> 2:28:13.520]  treasury department gave him a waiver to be involved with goldman sacks
[2:28:13.520 --> 2:28:18.000]  while he was giving billions to goldman sacks directly and through aig
[2:28:18.000 --> 2:28:22.960]  yeah no this is like a revolving door and and this is not
[2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:26.800]  this is not arms length this is not this is a conflict of interest and it's
[2:28:26.800 --> 2:28:30.080]  it's also a complaint you know they would call it a confluence of interest
[2:28:30.080 --> 2:28:34.320]  you know they're trying this is um this is a
[2:28:34.320 --> 2:28:37.440]  fundamentally corrupt i don't think paulson himself is fundamentally
[2:28:37.440 --> 2:28:41.120]  corrupt i think he's basically ever was a very good public
[2:28:41.120 --> 2:28:44.400]  servant he tried his best i think he did the wrong thing
[2:28:44.400 --> 2:28:48.560]  in the end uh or he did some steps but not the right
[2:28:48.560 --> 2:28:52.240]  other steps uh he has like 300 million dollars he doesn't
[2:28:52.240 --> 2:28:55.840]  necessarily have to worry about whether goldman sacks is going to like him at
[2:28:55.840 --> 2:28:59.680]  the margin so i think we've got to be careful about
[2:28:59.680 --> 2:29:03.200]  you know describing uh motives to individuals who are
[2:29:03.200 --> 2:29:06.880]  in a position of trying to save a country they thought was going down the
[2:29:06.880 --> 2:29:10.640]  tubes but we need the real thing is how do we get a system
[2:29:10.640 --> 2:29:15.680]  set up so uh so that wall street can influence uh
[2:29:15.680 --> 2:29:19.520]  pennsylvania avenue and uh there's no you know whether
[2:29:19.520 --> 2:29:22.880]  whether or not the guys from pennsylvania avenue go back to wall street to work
[2:29:22.880 --> 2:29:26.240]  uh they're not actually going to be changing the financial system in somebody's
[2:29:26.240 --> 2:29:28.560]  favor
[2:29:29.920 --> 2:29:35.440]  let's talk more about where the regulation is going versus what you're
[2:29:35.440 --> 2:29:38.560]  saying is a good idea and how do we get rid of these
[2:29:38.560 --> 2:29:41.760]  derivatives or is there a place in your plan
[2:29:41.760 --> 2:29:45.040]  or derivatives and will anybody ever get in trouble

[2:33:09.760 --> 2:33:13.120]  we're going to your phone calls on a wide range of issues in about
[2:33:13.120 --> 2:33:17.840]  seven minutes next hour in studio joe rogan
[2:33:17.840 --> 2:33:21.840]  host of ultimate fighting
[2:33:21.840 --> 2:33:28.080]  comedy central you name it giving us his view on the world today
[2:33:28.080 --> 2:33:31.440]  professor of economics bossing university laurence j
[2:33:31.440 --> 2:33:35.920]  kotlakov is our guest okay we got about seven minutes left sir
[2:33:35.920 --> 2:33:38.560]  um
[2:33:38.560 --> 2:33:42.800]  about whether the current solution being proposed by
[2:33:42.800 --> 2:33:46.480]  administration is the right way to go no i think it's just
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:49.680]  uh spending a lot of money and maintaining the current
[2:33:49.680 --> 2:33:52.960]  structure i think it's putting us at grave risk
[2:33:52.960 --> 2:33:57.920]  we could have uh really literally run on the bank tomorrow and uh
[2:33:57.920 --> 2:34:02.720]  have to print trillions of dollars uh to cover all the liabilities
[2:34:02.720 --> 2:34:06.400]  and then there would be high inflation that would
[2:34:06.400 --> 2:34:10.160]  most likely break out and then people who didn't run
[2:34:10.160 --> 2:34:13.360]  would find that they got their money back but that was worth nothing in terms
[2:34:13.360 --> 2:34:17.440]  of what they could buy with it so there's a
[2:34:17.440 --> 2:34:20.960]  there's this uh myth out there that we actually have
[2:34:20.960 --> 2:34:24.640]  purchasing power deposit insurance we just have money deposit insurance and
[2:34:24.640 --> 2:34:30.880]  it's not really going to protect us uh from uh the hyperinflation that might
[2:34:30.880 --> 2:34:36.720]  result from a run on the bank so so uh we're in very great risk we have to get
[2:34:36.720 --> 2:34:40.800]  to a safe financial structure we can't go back to 1930
[2:34:40.800 --> 2:34:45.040]  we need to have uh these new uh products derivatives
[2:34:45.040 --> 2:34:48.720]  they're not the problem the problem is that uh it's not that
[2:34:48.720 --> 2:34:52.000]  coming up with a new form of pain relief is is a problem
[2:34:52.000 --> 2:34:56.240]  uh a new pill like a Tylenol uh when that was developed that wasn't the
[2:34:56.240 --> 2:35:00.560]  problem the problem with uh is that when you have
[2:35:00.560 --> 2:35:04.720]  somebody putting cyanide in a Tylenol bottle
[2:35:04.720 --> 2:35:08.080]  and marketing it as Tylenol that's when you have a problem
[2:35:08.080 --> 2:35:12.320]  and that happened in the 70s uh uh exactly that happened
[2:35:12.320 --> 2:35:15.200]  and johnson johnson spent like a hundred million dollars
[2:35:15.200 --> 2:35:19.360]  taking all the Tylenol and repackaging it in safety if he'll
[2:35:19.360 --> 2:35:24.880]  containers we need to have uh a bulletproof system where the government
[2:35:24.880 --> 2:35:28.320]  says if you're going to buy this security you can check exactly what it is
[2:35:28.320 --> 2:35:31.520]  so you know what you're buying we need to make sure that the banks are just
[2:35:31.520 --> 2:35:37.280]  playing middlemen and they're not uh trying to play a poker with our chips
[2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:41.120]  and we need to uh just transform the entire financial
[2:35:41.120 --> 2:35:44.400]  uh corporate system including the insurance companies into past your
[2:35:44.400 --> 2:35:48.480]  mutual fund companies and run all the business through mutual funds
[2:35:48.480 --> 2:35:52.160]  and so for an example uh if you think about
[2:35:52.160 --> 2:35:57.520]  uh cds uh derivative security that's really just an insurance policy against
[2:35:57.520 --> 2:36:03.520]  uh a particular bond going uh broke uh going uh defaulting
[2:36:03.520 --> 2:36:07.120]  so you can have an insurance company set up a mutual fund where people
[2:36:07.120 --> 2:36:10.640]  invest money and they in effect take a position when
[2:36:10.640 --> 2:36:14.080]  they put their money down on whether or not ibm would
[2:36:14.080 --> 2:36:17.280]  default on its debt over the course of the year the money is all put
[2:36:17.280 --> 2:36:20.880]  into a uh a pot at the beginning of the year
[2:36:20.880 --> 2:36:24.480]  it's invested in treasury bills uh one of your treasury bills
[2:36:24.480 --> 2:36:28.800]  and then a year later you see whether or not ibm default on its debt
[2:36:28.800 --> 2:36:32.960]  if it did the ones who bet that way get the get the pot left to see
[2:36:32.960 --> 2:36:38.320]  the one if it doesn't the ones who bet the other way get the pot left to see
[2:36:38.320 --> 2:36:44.080]  so this kind of uh betting on uh whether a company defaults or
[2:36:44.080 --> 2:36:46.720]  whether the mortality rate of the economy exceeds
[2:36:46.720 --> 2:36:53.120]  some number or whether uh uh you have uh the
[2:36:53.120 --> 2:36:56.640]  gross domestic product grow by five percent or two percent
[2:36:56.640 --> 2:37:01.840]  all these kinds of uh uh bets the people should be allowed to make
[2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:05.280]  with each other for good economic reasons can arise
[2:37:05.280 --> 2:37:10.000]  safely in this system that i'm talking about limited purpose banking
[2:37:10.000 --> 2:37:12.640]  and if you look over if you think about it that kind of a
[2:37:12.640 --> 2:37:16.960]  of an insurance arrangement is really a paramutual betting arrangement which
[2:37:16.960 --> 2:37:19.520]  we see at the racetrack every day of the year
[2:37:19.520 --> 2:37:24.960]  so but but that's not a completely rigged system so the big central banks
[2:37:24.960 --> 2:37:28.560]  and the mega brokerage firms aren't going to want it as you said that's not
[2:37:28.560 --> 2:37:32.400]  the plan they're going with you brought up the dollar the g20 is openly
[2:37:32.400 --> 2:37:34.720]  discussing how to move away from the dollar the
[2:37:34.720 --> 2:37:38.640]  dollars dropping uh the price they just tried to
[2:37:38.640 --> 2:37:42.320]  we need to adopt what i'm proposing everybody needs to um
[2:37:42.320 --> 2:37:45.600]  to look at this idea which is limited purpose banking um
[2:37:45.600 --> 2:37:50.000]  the book will be out in march but in the short run there are columns i've written
[2:37:50.000 --> 2:37:55.840]  in the new republic bloomberg for the ft all on my website people can read um
[2:37:55.840 --> 2:37:59.360]  these pieces that have been written in the dallas morning news
[2:37:59.360 --> 2:38:03.280]  boston globe so this idea about how to fix the financial
[2:38:03.280 --> 2:38:06.800]  system is very simple and other economists are coming independently
[2:38:06.800 --> 2:38:10.960]  coming up with the same idea so it is a real solution
[2:38:10.960 --> 2:38:15.840]  it's the only comprehensive solution that uh anyone's really advanced in the
[2:38:15.840 --> 2:38:21.120]  public forum here and uh i think once uh the public
[2:38:21.120 --> 2:38:24.560]  gets behind it you know it may conflict with wall street's
[2:38:24.560 --> 2:38:27.680]  interest but um in the short run but i think over time they'll be in better
[2:38:27.680 --> 2:38:32.080]  shape if they go along with us because the alternative
[2:38:32.080 --> 2:38:36.080]  may be that they're going to be babysat in ways they don't like
[2:38:36.080 --> 2:38:40.800]  and uh but uh but paying people hundreds of millions of dollars for running
[2:38:40.800 --> 2:38:43.920]  companies into the ground that wouldn't happen under what i'm proposing
[2:38:43.920 --> 2:38:47.120]  people would uh the bankers would run the mutual funds
[2:38:47.120 --> 2:38:50.160]  and if they did poorly they get paid you know they wouldn't be able to charge
[2:38:50.160 --> 2:38:53.600]  very high fees if they did well they'd be able over time to charge higher
[2:38:53.600 --> 2:38:58.000]  so an actual free market but that's not a rig casino so they don't want that
[2:38:58.000 --> 2:39:00.960]  so it doesn't look like we're going to get that but after another crash maybe
[2:39:00.960 --> 2:39:05.840]  we'll get something like your solution on the current course in closing
[2:39:05.840 --> 2:39:09.280]  and give us your website and then in the current course
[2:39:09.280 --> 2:39:14.480]  where do you see us going where do you see us going on the current course
[2:39:14.480 --> 2:39:18.960]  on the current course of course i see this is very um very dicey
[2:39:18.960 --> 2:39:22.960]  what we're doing here we have uh the government has issued about
[2:39:22.960 --> 2:39:27.600]  24 trillion dollars worth of commitments to
[2:39:27.600 --> 2:39:32.720]  pay off things in certain uh under certain circumstances
[2:39:32.720 --> 2:39:37.680]  so uh you know and i could just we don't have time for me to list them all but
[2:39:37.680 --> 2:39:40.720]  that that number actually comes from the government itself
[2:39:40.720 --> 2:39:48.480]  so if uh if there's a a major event that uh people get panicked again
[2:39:48.480 --> 2:39:52.000]  we could see runs on the the banks runs on the insurance companies you know
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:55.120]  there's cash to render values to the tune of about three trillion dollars
[2:39:55.120 --> 2:39:57.920]  out there that people can run and try and get them
[2:39:57.920 --> 2:40:01.840]  uh cash in their insurance policies because i think the insurance company
[2:40:01.840 --> 2:40:08.800]  is going to go under you can have um this is what uh exactly what uh
[2:40:08.800 --> 2:40:12.240]  the Treasury and the Fed were so concerned about uh
[2:40:12.240 --> 2:40:16.000]  Paulson and Bernanke when they were really pulling out their hairs or
[2:40:16.000 --> 2:40:18.640]  remaining hairs about what what could happen
[2:40:18.640 --> 2:40:22.560]  we have to get our system out of that position
[2:40:22.560 --> 2:40:26.960]  where we can have systemic colossal financial failure
[2:40:26.960 --> 2:40:30.080]  we're still there we're in worse shape actually than we were a year ago in
[2:40:30.080 --> 2:40:33.520]  terms of that risk we've got to move away from that and limited
[2:40:33.520 --> 2:40:37.280]  purpose banking is the way to do it all right professor larry kotlakov thank

[2:41:14.080 --> 2:41:17.040]  set up the system are running it currently they're not going with his
[2:41:17.040 --> 2:41:21.120]  alternate plan or ron paul's alternate plan because it limits their power

[2:48:19.040 --> 2:48:22.720]  they say as well as what they omit telling the people
[2:48:22.720 --> 2:48:26.320]  uh i have a brief statement of fact that occurred here inside of california the
[2:48:26.320 --> 2:48:29.440]  other day a pregnant woman with pneumonia went
[2:48:29.440 --> 2:48:33.920]  to the hospital to give birth to her child during the delivery this woman died
[2:48:33.920 --> 2:48:38.320]  doing due to complications from the pneumonia but the hospital announced
[2:48:38.320 --> 2:48:43.120]  that she died from the swine flu the husband the father of the child which
[2:48:43.120 --> 2:48:48.000]  did survive um tried again again to correct their false announcements
[2:48:48.000 --> 2:48:51.280]  saying that she had died from complications due to the pneumonia that's
[2:48:51.280 --> 2:48:54.000]  because they've been paid to fair monger and hype
[2:48:54.000 --> 2:48:57.040]  and all over the country i don't know if your story is true i believe it but i
[2:48:57.040 --> 2:49:00.640]  can't confirm it right they've been caught saying people die from swine
[2:49:00.640 --> 2:49:04.400]  flu and then a week later there's a tiny blurb in the paper
[2:49:04.400 --> 2:49:07.760]  saying they actually died from something else
[2:49:07.760 --> 2:49:11.920]  they have not they've ignored what this fella has been saying it appears they've
[2:49:11.920 --> 2:49:15.360]  got them lying to falsify these statistics about well how did you learn
[2:49:15.360 --> 2:49:19.520]  about this actually i have a business uh my

[2:50:16.800 --> 2:50:20.720]  and they would show up and they'd say you're the only person saying this
[2:50:20.720 --> 2:50:24.560]  and then more parents would walk in and say you injected my kid
[2:50:24.560 --> 2:50:28.480]  and then it came out in the news everywhere they're doing it
[2:50:28.480 --> 2:50:32.560]  so a they're doing it illegally and secretly b they lie about it when they
[2:50:32.560 --> 2:50:36.320]  get caught and c they've now been caught lying about it

[3:01:38.080 --> 3:01:41.520]  asked the lady on the the bank of america i said what what is the federal law
[3:01:41.520 --> 3:01:46.400]  she said the patriot act so i guess the patriot act compliance gets rid of the
[3:01:46.400 --> 3:01:49.600]  fourth amendment surveils everything it's horrible
[3:01:49.600 --> 3:01:52.880]  it is all i i i just want to say man i'm a big fan i really look up to you

[3:02:02.800 --> 3:02:08.400]  let's go ahead and talk to uh david in texas david you're on the air
[3:02:08.400 --> 3:02:12.960]  hey alex uh i've talked to you before look i work in finance and uh i'll tell
[3:02:12.960 --> 3:02:17.760]  you the people in our industry know very very little about economics and
[3:02:17.760 --> 3:02:21.680]  sometimes even investments and you know i happen to know a lot of these guys that
[3:02:21.680 --> 3:02:25.600]  are chief investment officers up at the major firms
[3:02:25.600 --> 3:02:29.920]  that people know you know tim coe blackrock leg mason i can go on and on
[3:02:29.920 --> 3:02:34.880]  but they give a lot of speeches and conferences and the stuff they put out
[3:02:34.880 --> 3:02:38.640]  to the media but you know if you have a relationship with these guys
[3:02:38.640 --> 3:02:43.120]  and if they know that you know what they know
[3:02:43.120 --> 3:02:47.680]  but if you get what i mean if they know that you understand
[3:02:47.680 --> 3:02:52.720]  the same level of understanding they have they're a little more open i found
[3:02:52.720 --> 3:02:57.040]  because since i talked to you i don't know a month ago i try to be a lot more
[3:02:57.040 --> 3:03:00.560]  pointing it with my question into these guys now that they understand i know a
[3:03:00.560 --> 3:03:04.000]  little bit more and they're all in agreement
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:08.640]  that some majors the themes that get talked about on your show are coming
[3:03:08.640 --> 3:03:13.360]  down economically anyway they all are in agreement that either
[3:03:13.360 --> 3:03:16.960]  slow and over time or potentially quicker that
[3:03:16.960 --> 3:03:20.800]  the dollar will fall against all other currencies no question
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:24.560]  they know that's gonna happen yeah that decision has been openly announced
[3:03:24.560 --> 3:03:29.920]  yeah yeah so they you know and it's not that they
[3:03:29.920 --> 3:03:33.200]  it's just not their mainstream view that they give out but
[3:03:33.200 --> 3:03:36.080]  again if they know that you understand the stuff they know
[3:03:36.080 --> 3:03:40.240]  then they're a little more open if you're friendly with them so anyway
[3:03:40.240 --> 3:03:43.520]  point number one number two inflation will go up
[3:03:43.520 --> 3:03:46.640]  or at least the prices of stuff will go up inflation is already happening
[3:03:46.640 --> 3:03:51.200]  because that's monetary base expansion which clearly has been happening
[3:03:51.200 --> 3:03:57.520]  stocks will go up probably over time but it's going to be negated by the
[3:03:57.520 --> 3:04:01.200]  inflation and i bring it back to the
[3:04:01.200 --> 3:04:05.120]  simple point of you know back in 2000 when when the dow was around 10 000 and
[3:04:05.120 --> 3:04:08.960]  gold was 250 you know look at where it is now that
[3:04:08.960 --> 3:04:12.320]  that ratio was it cost 40 ounces of gold to buy the dow
[3:04:12.320 --> 3:04:17.040]  then and now with gold over a thousand now it costs like
[3:04:17.040 --> 3:04:20.320]  nine ounces of gold and probably depending on who you listen to that
[3:04:20.320 --> 3:04:24.560]  relationship will will slowly go down five to one
[3:04:24.560 --> 3:04:29.040]  and maybe the two to one so does that mean that the dow is at 20 000
[3:04:29.040 --> 3:04:32.480]  and gold is at 10 000 you know that that relationship
[3:04:32.480 --> 3:04:35.520]  is probably going to exist stock market can still go up but
[3:04:35.520 --> 3:04:38.880]  again it's a purchasing power that makes sense
[3:04:38.880 --> 3:04:43.760]  or the purchasing power of the matters but the other part the last part is that
[3:04:43.760 --> 3:04:46.400]  you know most of these guys and firms and people in business you know they're
[3:04:46.400 --> 3:04:49.920]  selling to their book meaning that they're selling
[3:04:49.920 --> 3:04:53.440]  they're trying to sell you on what they sell or what they recommend
[3:04:53.440 --> 3:04:56.880]  so you got to listen you got to you know
[3:04:56.880 --> 3:05:00.080]  understand who i hear you and i appreciate your call we'll be right back
[3:05:00.080 --> 3:05:03.120]  folks stay with us hey folks this is alex jones and i want to tell you about

[3:08:06.720 --> 3:08:12.400]  and what are we doing instead at Copenhagen
[3:08:12.400 --> 3:08:19.280]  this december weeks away a treaty will be signed your president will sign it
[3:08:19.280 --> 3:08:21.600]  most of the third world countries will sign it because they think they're going
[3:08:21.600 --> 3:08:24.800]  to get money out of it most of the left-wing regimes around the world
[3:08:24.800 --> 3:08:30.080]  like the european union will rubber stamp it virtually nobody won't sign it
[3:08:30.080 --> 3:08:34.080]  i have read that treaty and what it says
[3:08:34.080 --> 3:08:39.040]  is this that a world government is going to be created
[3:08:39.040 --> 3:08:43.520]  the word government actually appears as the first of three purposes of the new
[3:08:43.520 --> 3:08:48.480]  entity the second purpose is the transfer of wealth
[3:08:48.480 --> 3:08:53.360]  from the countries of the west to third world countries
[3:08:53.360 --> 3:08:57.600]  in satisfaction of what is called coily a climate
[3:08:57.600 --> 3:09:01.920]  debt because we've been burning co2 and they haven't and we've been screwing up
[3:09:01.920 --> 3:09:05.040]  the climate we haven't been screwing up the climate but that's the line
[3:09:05.040 --> 3:09:09.360]  and the third purpose of this new entity this government
[3:09:09.360 --> 3:09:13.360]  is enforcement how many of you think that the word
[3:09:13.360 --> 3:09:18.640]  election or democracy or vote or ballot occurs anywhere in the 200 pages of
[3:09:18.640 --> 3:09:21.360]  that treaty quite right it doesn't appear
[3:09:21.360 --> 3:09:27.440]  once so at last the communists who piled out
[3:09:27.440 --> 3:09:32.480]  of the berlin wall and into the environmental movement and took over
[3:09:32.480 --> 3:09:36.480]  greenpeace so that my friends who founded it left within a year
[3:09:36.480 --> 3:09:41.760]  because they'd captured it now the apotheosis is at hand
[3:09:41.760 --> 3:09:46.800]  they are about to impose a communist world government on the world
[3:09:46.800 --> 3:09:50.240]  you have a president who has very strong sympathies with that point of view he's
[3:09:50.240 --> 3:09:53.040]  going to sign he'll sign anything he's a no-well peace lawyer of course he'll
[3:09:53.040 --> 3:09:56.560]  sign it and the trouble is this
[3:09:56.560 --> 3:09:59.680]  if that treaty is signed your constitution says that it takes
[3:09:59.680 --> 3:10:04.240]  precedence over your constitution and you can't resile from that treaty
[3:10:04.240 --> 3:10:07.360]  unless you get the agreement of all the other states parties and because you'll
[3:10:07.360 --> 3:10:12.400]  be the biggest paying country they're not going to let you out
[3:10:12.400 --> 3:10:18.560]  so thank you america you were the beacon of freedom to the world
[3:10:18.560 --> 3:10:22.800]  it is a privilege merely to stand on this soil of freedom
[3:10:22.800 --> 3:10:27.440]  while it is still free but in the next few weeks
[3:10:27.440 --> 3:10:32.160]  unless you stop it your president will sign
[3:10:32.160 --> 3:10:36.080]  your freedom your democracy and your prosperity
[3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:41.440]  away forever and neither you nor any subsequent government you may elect
[3:10:41.440 --> 3:10:45.680]  will have any power whatsoever to take it back again
[3:10:45.680 --> 3:10:49.760]  that is how serious it is i've read the treaty i've seen this stuff about
[3:10:49.760 --> 3:10:54.000]  government and climate debt and enforcement they are going to do this to

[3:11:16.720 --> 3:11:20.880]  president from signing that dreadful treaty that
[3:11:20.880 --> 3:11:23.840]  purposeless treaty for there is no problem with the climate and even if there

[3:15:49.040 --> 3:15:53.040]  news documents new york times bancai moon head of the u n says get ready for
[3:15:53.040 --> 3:15:56.560]  global government god how could that be good i mean joe how
[3:15:56.560 --> 3:16:01.040]  much of the stuff we talked about 12 years ago is now coming true
[3:16:01.040 --> 3:16:04.880]  well a lot you know it's really interesting when you first you and i
[3:16:04.880 --> 3:16:08.960]  first talked we talked on september 11 2001 we talked on that day and you were
[3:16:08.960 --> 3:16:11.840]  telling me we were friends before that we talked on air
[3:16:11.840 --> 3:16:15.040]  yeah yeah we were friends for a couple years by then and we talked on the air
[3:16:15.040 --> 3:16:20.240]  the day of the uh the september 11 attacks alex was going crazy he was on
[3:16:20.240 --> 3:16:23.440]  the phone joe there this was a plot by the american
[3:16:23.440 --> 3:16:27.440]  government they did this they allowed this to happen they planned it in
[3:16:27.440 --> 3:16:31.680]  advance they detonated those buildings i have experts
[3:16:31.680 --> 3:16:36.560]  you went crazy way before anybody dude no nobody is more of a 9-11 like
[3:16:36.560 --> 3:16:41.920]  pioneer than you well thank you joe what do you think a 9-11 now eight years on
[3:16:41.920 --> 3:16:45.760]  tower seven disturbs me the most i look at i look at towers one and two and i
[3:16:45.760 --> 3:16:48.720]  go well those guys they got hit by planes you know and look at the fire and
[3:16:48.720 --> 3:16:51.840]  everything maybe maybe it broke maybe everyone's being crazy
[3:16:51.840 --> 3:16:56.240]  but that tower seven just went whoosh just like a controlled demolition
[3:16:56.240 --> 3:16:58.560]  and everybody's like yeah but it had holes in the building and you see the
[3:16:58.560 --> 3:17:02.400]  hole in the building yes i see the hole in the building but wouldn't it fall
[3:17:02.400 --> 3:17:06.320]  towards that hole why is it falling like that and if that was my building i
[3:17:06.320 --> 3:17:11.040]  would sue the i almost swear but the cia was in that building
[3:17:11.040 --> 3:17:14.080]  yeah and we have the firemen and police saying whatever we've been told we're
[3:17:14.080 --> 3:17:16.560]  blowing it up get back yeah and what other
[3:17:16.560 --> 3:17:20.160]  organizations there's a bunch of other fbi defense intelligence there was a
[3:17:20.160 --> 3:17:23.840]  lot of documents in that buildings in that building rather so
[3:17:23.840 --> 3:17:27.120]  that that building bothers me a lot i don't like security's in exchange
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:32.000]  commission it fell just looks so fake it was incredible i mean it looks exactly
[3:17:32.000 --> 3:17:34.720]  like a troll they were on the news saying we're going to bring it down for
[3:17:34.720 --> 3:17:37.920]  everyone's safety we're going to blow it up we have the video clips
[3:17:37.920 --> 3:17:42.000]  of bbc cnn cbs and then after they said we didn't say we're going to
[3:17:42.000 --> 3:17:45.120]  blow it up we didn't say we blow it up i've seen those i've seen we can play
[3:17:45.120 --> 3:17:48.560]  in fact i would give him a truth rising i would love i see i've seen the larry
[3:17:48.560 --> 3:17:52.160]  silverstein guys say pull it but that could have been he just
[3:17:52.160 --> 3:17:58.400]  hey guys google google um google um building seven police
[3:17:58.400 --> 3:18:02.080]  say get back gonna pull it you know the first two buildings fell
[3:18:02.080 --> 3:18:05.520]  totally different the first two buildings fell from where they got
[3:18:05.520 --> 3:18:09.360]  jacked like you could see like you know right it but there were blast swabs
[3:18:09.360 --> 3:18:13.120]  there too boom boom i don't know what that is i'm not an expert i have no
[3:18:13.120 --> 3:18:16.720]  information about that i mean just to take just devil's advocate that could
[3:18:16.720 --> 3:18:20.960]  be just the pressure of the building collapsing forcing all this air out and
[3:18:20.960 --> 3:18:24.720]  forcing all these windows to explode that's just as possible
[3:18:24.720 --> 3:18:28.080]  that doesn't make sense to me with tower seven the way tower seven fell it
[3:18:28.080 --> 3:18:32.640]  just kinked in the middle and fell down freefall speed
[3:18:32.640 --> 3:18:35.520]  almost i mean everybody like they'll they'll nitpick at you oh it was one
[3:18:35.520 --> 3:18:39.120]  tenth of a second slower than freefall no no no nistus had to go back now
[3:18:39.120 --> 3:18:42.720]  and admitted okay there was freefall in the first uh 10 floors
[3:18:42.720 --> 3:18:46.560]  well even if it was just close to freefall that's crazy there was no
[3:18:46.560 --> 3:18:50.640]  resistance it just gave up why wouldn't it like wiggle and collapse
[3:18:50.640 --> 3:18:55.040]  towards where jack got jacked it does it just seems like a controlled demolition
[3:18:55.040 --> 3:18:59.200]  that that bothers me or maybe the building was taking dmt i don't think
[3:18:59.200 --> 3:19:03.680]  it would have done that if it was
[3:19:03.680 --> 3:19:07.440]  it's good to have you here so so i know the shows always sell out are they
[3:19:07.440 --> 3:19:10.240]  sold out yet i don't know i don't know because i've gone a lot of your shows

[3:24:26.000 --> 3:24:29.920]  just in the last few seconds another building building number seven one of
[3:24:29.920 --> 3:24:33.360]  the buildings uh in support of the world trade center
[3:24:33.360 --> 3:24:37.040]  towers has collapsed
[3:24:39.520 --> 3:24:43.360]  okay guys back that up to the first again and there's literally scores of
[3:24:43.360 --> 3:24:46.720]  these clips this is police saying get back to bringing it down it's coming
[3:24:46.720 --> 3:24:50.560]  down and i heard that on cbs radio that day but then
[3:24:50.560 --> 3:24:54.880]  we have the news clips where bbc reports it's fallen before it fell
[3:24:54.880 --> 3:24:58.560]  yeah i read about that okay let's go ahead and roll the clip again from the
[3:24:58.560 --> 3:25:01.440]  start for everybody where the police are saying get back and then i've
[3:25:01.440 --> 3:25:05.520]  interviewed craig bartner and other police officers who were there and they
[3:25:05.520 --> 3:25:08.480]  said they walked up to femur and said what are you doing and they said
[3:25:08.480 --> 3:25:13.520]  count down ten nine eight seven six run for your lives it was a countdown on
[3:25:13.520 --> 3:25:16.560]  the radio to blow up seven let's go ahead and play it
[3:25:16.560 --> 3:25:24.400]  here it is
[3:25:24.400 --> 3:25:28.400]  if you're on that building it'll be coming down
[3:25:28.400 --> 3:25:30.400]  don't think it's about to blow up
[3:25:30.400 --> 3:25:32.400]  hold it back
[3:25:32.400 --> 3:25:34.400]  all right guys
[3:25:34.400 --> 3:25:36.400]  we are looking back
[3:25:36.400 --> 3:25:39.920]  so yeah so there's three different police saying keep your eye on it the whole
[3:25:39.920 --> 3:25:43.280]  thing's about to come down it's about to blow up get back and then we went and
[3:25:43.280 --> 3:25:46.880]  found police officers that were there we also have a
[3:25:46.880 --> 3:25:51.120]  democracy now show where they were live when it happened okay but isn't it
[3:25:51.120 --> 3:25:55.120]  possible is it or is it possible rather that um those cops were saying that the
[3:25:55.120 --> 3:25:57.760]  building's going to fall because it was about to collapse because it was just
[3:25:57.760 --> 3:26:00.640]  on fire no steel building and never collapsed from fire until three that
[3:26:00.640 --> 3:26:03.280]  day that's true no no no and then we have silver
[3:26:03.280 --> 3:26:06.480]  seen saying we made the decision to pull it gave the order and watch to come down
[3:26:06.480 --> 3:26:10.560]  so you believe that the reason why they brought this down was whatever
[3:26:10.560 --> 3:26:13.600]  documents they had in there were very incriminating and they had gotten away
[3:26:13.600 --> 3:26:16.880]  with a lot of different you know a lot of corruption and that's why they brought
[3:26:16.880 --> 3:26:19.680]  that down because it just makes everything else disappear well they picked a
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:22.880]  site where they could destroy a building and then cover up their evidence
[3:26:22.880 --> 3:26:26.800]  during another attack they were using as a pretext to launch wars
[3:26:26.800 --> 3:26:31.760]  so you firmly believe that the attacks on the twin towers were premeditated by
[3:26:31.760 --> 3:26:34.400]  the united states government in order to bring us into war
[3:26:34.400 --> 3:26:37.920]  i believed it eight years ago on 9 11 that night you came on
[3:26:37.920 --> 3:26:41.280]  yeah you did it's it's fascinating really when you think about it because
[3:26:41.280 --> 3:26:45.040]  you know everyone this is the main problem with conspiracy theories the
[3:26:45.040 --> 3:26:48.640]  number one problem is that when you you bring them up you look foolish
[3:26:48.640 --> 3:26:51.440]  so people don't even want to they don't even want to bring up the possibility
[3:26:51.440 --> 3:26:54.480]  that they exist but when you look into u.s history you look
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:26:57.760]  into the gulf of tonkin you look into the north woods
[3:26:57.760 --> 3:27:02.080]  document where they were planning fake terror attacks on american civilians
[3:27:02.080 --> 3:27:05.040]  in order to get us into a war with cuba from 1962
[3:27:05.040 --> 3:27:08.880]  when you look into that stuff and you realize that everything evolves
[3:27:08.880 --> 3:27:12.160]  you know science evolves culture evolves and you know
[3:27:12.160 --> 3:27:15.840]  corruption evolves too the the corruption that is that deep
[3:27:15.840 --> 3:27:18.880]  that could run the government the corruption that can kill kennedy
[3:27:18.880 --> 3:27:22.640]  the corruption that can fake wars or fake attacks rather than to bring us
[3:27:22.640 --> 3:27:25.600]  into war like they did with the gulf of tonkin and brought us into vietnam
[3:27:25.600 --> 3:27:28.960]  that doesn't go away it gets bigger and stronger as long as
[3:27:28.960 --> 3:27:32.800]  it isn't exposed as long as some massive arrests didn't take place
[3:27:32.800 --> 3:27:36.240]  and hundreds and thousands of people were brought to justice and paraded on
[3:27:36.240 --> 3:27:38.560]  on television no i mean the biggest corruption ever
[3:27:38.560 --> 3:27:42.880]  was watergate what was that he was spying on some other people that's it i mean
[3:27:42.880 --> 3:27:46.000]  that's that's now we just expect the government to spy on us
[3:27:46.000 --> 3:27:49.200]  but if you compare that to what we know has taken place
[3:27:49.200 --> 3:27:52.960]  just the gulf of tonkin just that the the fake attack that brought us into
[3:27:52.960 --> 3:27:55.600]  vietnam war just the idea that the north woods
[3:27:55.600 --> 3:27:59.760]  document was actually signed by the joint chiefs of staff they sat down
[3:27:59.760 --> 3:28:04.000]  and they said yes we agree this idea of fake terror attacks on american
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:07.680]  civilians is a good idea people are gonna die for
[3:28:07.680 --> 3:28:12.080]  lies for for for theater that they're gonna create they're gonna create these
[3:28:12.080 --> 3:28:15.920]  you know the fake Cuban attacks i mean that's that's scary scary stuff
[3:28:15.920 --> 3:28:19.680]  and if no one was brought to justice and they weren't it's not like that stopped
[3:28:19.680 --> 3:28:22.800]  and everybody just got a conscience and met in the parking lot and all held
[3:28:22.800 --> 3:28:26.160]  hands and sang kumbaya and decided well we're not going to be douchebags
[3:28:26.160 --> 3:28:28.480]  anymore we're going to be nice the way we run the world
[3:28:28.480 --> 3:28:32.880]  there's no way if that's not what happened and you know people don't want to
[3:28:32.880 --> 3:28:35.440]  look at the possibility that our government is involved in some
[3:28:35.440 --> 3:28:40.000]  really scary really shady stuff that involves the death of our own citizens
[3:28:40.000 --> 3:28:43.600]  for profit people don't want to look at that but it is possible
[3:28:43.600 --> 3:28:48.000]  absolutely and and 30 years ago even a decade ago they called it a conspiracy
[3:28:48.000 --> 3:28:51.280]  theory to say the gulf of Tonkin in 1964
[3:28:51.280 --> 3:28:55.120]  was a conspiracy theory now it's been declassified the lbj tapes have been
[3:28:55.120 --> 3:28:58.240]  released they did stage the whole thing and 58
[3:28:58.240 --> 3:29:02.000]  thousand americans died over a million vietnamese so history channelists say it
[3:29:02.000 --> 3:29:05.280]  said that the united states had advanced warning about pearl harbor and that they
[3:29:05.280 --> 3:29:08.480]  allowed it to happen to bring us into world war two that was on the history
[3:29:08.480 --> 3:29:12.400]  channel not that it means anything

[3:33:30.160 --> 3:33:34.880]  smoke until we got here but watch um the uh the traffic was uh the
[3:33:34.880 --> 3:33:38.560]  navigation system was terrible it's wacky it was some piece of crap that came

[3:34:02.800 --> 3:34:06.560]  so we were talking about before the break about the government is uh worried
[3:34:06.560 --> 3:34:10.800]  about conservatives and gun owners and you know and i think they should be i
[3:34:10.800 --> 3:34:12.800]  think if the government really is corrupt those are the ones you have to
[3:34:12.800 --> 3:34:15.280]  worry about you don't have to worry about the hippies with the subarus with
[3:34:15.280 --> 3:34:18.400]  the bumper stickers on those aren't the dangerous ones the nitty around the
[3:34:18.400 --> 3:34:21.360]  dangerous ones are the dudes who know the constitution the dudes are living out
[3:34:21.360 --> 3:34:24.800]  in the desert with dried fruit in their basement and you know and they got water
[3:34:24.800 --> 3:34:27.680]  you know the giant cistern in the backyard that can last them for three
[3:34:27.680 --> 3:34:29.600]  years those are the guys you have to worry about those are the guys they're
[3:34:29.600 --> 3:34:32.160]  going to organize those are you're saying the criminals have to worry about
[3:34:32.160 --> 3:34:36.240]  yeah the criminals yeah but but that's my point is that all these years we knew
[3:34:36.240 --> 3:34:39.120]  the way they set it up at homeland security was for the american people
[3:34:39.120 --> 3:34:42.960]  then we got all these secret documents well the and it has nothing to do with
[3:34:42.960 --> 3:34:46.000]  foreigners it is for the american people you've got to be worried about people
[3:34:46.000 --> 3:34:50.160]  organizing not because there's something evil about organizing but
[3:34:50.160 --> 3:34:54.000]  because people are such lemmings that's the real problem with like waco texas
[3:34:54.000 --> 3:34:56.880]  and stuff like that when you see some dudes stocking up guns you gotta go
[3:34:56.880 --> 3:35:00.160]  god damn it what is that idiot doing you know you got to worry about that if
[3:35:00.160 --> 3:35:02.640]  you're the government or if you're regular civilians because
[3:35:02.640 --> 3:35:06.240]  guess what man it's like what's going on in afghanistan they have warlords
[3:35:06.240 --> 3:35:10.000]  and these warlords run regions of the country and that's one of the reasons
[3:35:10.000 --> 3:35:13.200]  why it's so difficult to break through over there that could happen in america
[3:35:13.200 --> 3:35:17.360]  we could have cults where these cults are armed and they have to control
[3:35:17.360 --> 3:35:20.560]  big big big pieces of the population that's very possible
[3:35:20.560 --> 3:35:22.800]  all right hearing about how do you get easily pull that off
[3:35:22.800 --> 3:35:27.120]  hearing about five minutes i've got a call in our she fears anti-scientology

[3:35:42.000 --> 3:35:47.920]  hex yeah i'm not bill hex i mean no you're
[3:35:47.920 --> 3:35:51.440]  definitely not but but because i've worked with with somebody that
[3:35:51.440 --> 3:35:54.960]  worked with him yeah and he had kind of a southern
[3:35:54.960 --> 3:35:57.840]  accent it must be me you know a really huge compliment
[3:35:57.840 --> 3:36:00.960]  kevin booth always says that you're funnier than bill hex you know
[3:36:00.960 --> 3:36:04.320]  well i don't think i'm funnier than bill hex well bill hex said a lot of
[3:36:04.320 --> 3:36:06.640]  brilliant stuff but you might be funnier than him
[3:36:06.640 --> 3:36:10.160]  you're funny in a different way i think you're definitely funnier than him
[3:36:10.160 --> 3:36:14.000]  well aria is honestly aria though he is one of my best friends and a great
[3:36:14.000 --> 3:36:16.960]  comic of his own he's not a fan of the bill hex
[3:36:16.960 --> 3:36:19.920]  he doesn't he does not believe this is a r right there
[3:36:19.920 --> 3:36:24.000]  aria does not believe that the uh the bill hex was very funny
[3:36:24.000 --> 3:36:28.320]  no we got some really bad news here nbc news seven dead 12 injured in
[3:36:28.320 --> 3:36:32.480]  fordhood shooting no word from military bases whether the victims are
[3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:36.000]  military or civilians at least seven people are dead and 12 wounded
[3:36:36.000 --> 3:36:39.040]  that's the last place that nut drove into the loopies and shot everybody but
[3:36:39.040 --> 3:36:42.080]  nobody was allowed to be arms he could do it so that's probably some soldier
[3:36:42.080 --> 3:36:44.320]  went crazy is it try to get susanna hopper
[3:36:44.320 --> 3:36:48.160]  susanna hop on tomorrow anti-american person went in there yeah it was her
[3:36:48.160 --> 3:36:51.360]  dad mom got killed there now she's a state rep let's get her on about this
[3:36:51.360 --> 3:36:54.640]  the official would not give his name or additional details it was unknown
[3:36:54.640 --> 3:36:58.400]  whether victims or soldiers or civilians you know it probably ended up being a
[3:36:58.400 --> 3:37:01.680]  soldier that's gone isn't it kind of fascinating i mean it's
[3:37:01.680 --> 3:37:04.560]  let's say it's not a soldier what if it was an attack
[3:37:04.560 --> 3:37:08.560]  isn't it kind of fascinating that it's a huge deal if someone gets attacked on
[3:37:08.560 --> 3:37:11.760]  this patch of dirt but like how many different
[3:37:11.760 --> 3:37:16.480]  days go by where 10 soldiers die in afghanistan and doesn't even make
[3:37:16.480 --> 3:37:20.000]  mainstream news it's just like it's because it is rare to happen here
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:23.280]  and because a lot of people are cowardly it scares why is that why
[3:37:23.280 --> 3:37:28.160]  yeah that's it but why is it you know why is it more news if americans die here
[3:37:28.160 --> 3:37:30.800]  i mean is it really more news i mean we make such a
[3:37:30.800 --> 3:37:34.480]  so light of the people that die in afghanistan and iraq i mean it's really
[3:37:34.480 --> 3:37:39.360]  crazy you know like one kid is missing and it's front page news for days
[3:37:39.360 --> 3:37:42.880]  weeks but but soldiers can get shot up and killed
[3:37:42.880 --> 3:37:46.000]  three four at a time and it's just a tiny little story
[3:37:46.000 --> 3:37:49.440]  and then we move on i mean that's a very they don't even allow the coffins to
[3:37:49.440 --> 3:37:51.680]  be seen yeah like well they didn't for a while but
[3:37:51.680 --> 3:37:55.440]  didn't obama rescind that didn't he change that he allows select groups of
[3:37:55.440 --> 3:37:59.200]  coffins to be seen i mean the whole thing is so scary that they
[3:37:59.200 --> 3:38:02.640]  they're blocking information they censor information if they're censoring
[3:38:02.640 --> 3:38:05.760]  photographs they're censoring information they don't want you to see the
[3:38:05.760 --> 3:38:08.240]  numbers they don't want you to be affected by the numbers
[3:38:08.240 --> 3:38:12.240]  that's scary stuff for i agree and and and i always say my heart goes out to
[3:38:12.240 --> 3:38:14.960]  those that have died you know the media is going to be saying about this
[3:38:14.960 --> 3:38:18.560]  incident but our heart does go out it's just shocking how we just go with it
[3:38:18.560 --> 3:38:21.600]  that's what's shocking to me that was the most shocking thing about 911
[3:38:21.600 --> 3:38:25.600]  was that like within a couple days all these people were driving by with
[3:38:25.600 --> 3:38:29.840]  american flags all over the cars and for a while i was like well maybe this is
[3:38:29.840 --> 3:38:32.560]  good you know because i was like you know okay look people are gonna feel good
[3:38:32.560 --> 3:38:35.520]  about america we're gonna rally together on this you know we've been attacked
[3:38:35.520 --> 3:38:39.120]  but then part of me was like wow this is scary how quick it happened
[3:38:39.120 --> 3:38:42.080]  i mean these are same dopes that had lakers flags on their cars just a few
[3:38:42.080 --> 3:38:44.960]  months ago when the lakers were winning and now you know that now it's like a
[3:38:44.960 --> 3:38:50.960]  it's like a a inch deep mile wide fad yeah yeah it's not a real commitment
[3:38:50.960 --> 3:38:54.960]  it's fine because the flags are gone now who has american flags hanging from
[3:38:54.960 --> 3:38:58.400]  their car a few lone nuts a few crazy dudes
[3:38:58.400 --> 3:39:01.760]  the very few but it's you know you don't like it back then you would go into a
[3:39:01.760 --> 3:39:05.840]  parking lot you pull into a walmart parking lot and you would see 30 40 50
[3:39:05.840 --> 3:39:09.120]  cars with american flags on them and nobody touched those you see cars with
[3:39:09.120 --> 3:39:13.360]  giant full-size flags yeah yeah he did around here and guys are driving around
[3:39:13.360 --> 3:39:17.280]  with alcada hunting license going i'm gonna get me some alcada
[3:39:17.280 --> 3:39:22.080]  yeah i saw a guy who had one of those in the t-shirt on it said osama your mama

[3:40:23.120 --> 3:40:26.480]  really like there's a lot of paranoid nuts out there man
[3:40:26.480 --> 3:40:30.320]  well there's a lot of people think i've put chips in their brains you haven't
[3:40:30.320 --> 3:40:33.520]  you haven't well the issue is i get to i mean i cover real issues
[3:40:33.520 --> 3:40:37.040]  and then there is all the crazies out there we think they're possessed by the
[3:40:37.040 --> 3:40:40.960]  Palladians or right whatever you think about like that david ike character
[3:40:40.960 --> 3:40:44.320]  because that's the reptilian dude you know i think he has 99 percent of his
[3:40:44.320 --> 3:40:47.280]  information is very important he's a great speaker and he goes reptilian on
[3:40:47.280 --> 3:40:50.080]  your ass what's all that about does that guy work for the government is he a
[3:40:50.080 --> 3:40:53.840]  disinformation agent i don't think i don't i don't think so he really believes
[3:40:53.840 --> 3:40:57.520]  that people can transform studying the satanic rituals of the elites and what
[3:40:57.520 --> 3:41:00.640]  they believe they are there's a lot of nuts who believe they're vampires they're
[3:41:00.640 --> 3:41:03.280]  not really vampires right and so there are a lot of these
[3:41:03.280 --> 3:41:08.240]  elitists do believe that uh it's some weird stuff
[3:41:08.240 --> 3:41:11.760]  so is he on to something with the reptiles i know
[3:41:11.760 --> 3:41:15.200]  joe i only cover what i can prove and document but we are on a planet hurtling
[3:41:15.200 --> 3:41:18.800]  through space yes i mean really when you think about what we do have on this
[3:41:18.800 --> 3:41:22.160]  planet it wouldn't be that bizarre if people became lizards
[3:41:22.160 --> 3:41:25.600]  you know i mean that's that's a lot less crazy than black holes or tornadoes are
[3:41:25.600 --> 3:41:28.080]  we gonna do this dallas thing or i'm not gonna do it tornadoes are pretty
[3:41:28.080 --> 3:41:31.760]  crazy okay okay fine no i don't care i just
[3:41:31.760 --> 3:41:34.960]  want to get out of the way um okay let's get serious here for a moment
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:38.480]  did you see the new york times last week where they just admitted that mohammed
[3:41:38.480 --> 3:41:42.800]  carzai's brothers the head opium dealer opium productions up over 12 times
[3:41:42.800 --> 3:41:48.000]  since we liberated it and that our cia is basically protecting the opium i heard
[3:41:48.000 --> 3:41:51.360]  bbc three months ago admit that but to have the government just going yeah
[3:41:51.360 --> 3:41:54.960]  we grow the opium we're gonna put you in prison if we catch you with it
[3:41:54.960 --> 3:41:57.920]  i did see that i found it incredibly fascinating
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:42:01.440]  how little it was talked about like you know like again let's bring up water
[3:42:01.440 --> 3:42:04.160]  gate watergate was someone spying on someone
[3:42:04.160 --> 3:42:09.120]  this is the united states government is paying the brother of the president of
[3:42:09.120 --> 3:42:14.320]  afghanistan the cia is involved they grow 93 percent
[3:42:14.320 --> 3:42:18.400]  of the world's heroin the cia has a long history of being accused of selling
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:22.720]  drugs that all that together is like wow they've been caught they've been caught
[3:42:22.720 --> 3:42:26.400]  they've been caught with a plane that crashed recently in mexico had four
[3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:31.360]  tons of cocaine of pure cocaine cia aircraft been to guantanamo bay on at
[3:42:31.360 --> 3:42:35.280]  least one separate occasion i think two occasions right yeah well it was flying
[3:42:35.280 --> 3:42:39.760]  people all over the world to torture sites yeah it was a cia plane and it had
[3:42:39.760 --> 3:42:44.560]  four tons of cocaine and you hear not your cocaine coming from the source
[3:42:44.560 --> 3:42:48.000]  that's way crazier than watergate you know what i'm saying i mean we put it all
[3:42:48.000 --> 3:42:52.080]  into perspective that is incredible well that's why they went after
[3:42:52.080 --> 3:42:55.280]  nixon for a small thing that didn't touch other releases why they went after
[3:42:55.280 --> 3:42:58.640]  clinton for a woman in the white house because that's a little
[3:42:58.640 --> 3:43:02.400]  corruption they can burn them for that doesn't affect all the other amazing
[3:43:02.400 --> 3:43:06.160]  how that works it's so what's your i mean how can we not decriminalize drugs
[3:43:06.160 --> 3:43:08.880]  when europe's done it and it's made drug abuse go way down
[3:43:08.880 --> 3:43:12.480]  we know prohibition of alcohol trick a tripled alcoholism
[3:43:12.480 --> 3:43:16.000]  no we know the drugs are kept illegal because the big cia banks
[3:43:16.000 --> 3:43:19.760]  are laundering the money well it's that too and it's also that the the
[3:43:19.760 --> 3:43:22.320]  politicians i mean it that's that's like the big
[3:43:22.320 --> 3:43:25.680]  idea you know the giant version of it the smaller version of it is that
[3:43:25.680 --> 3:43:29.280]  politicians get into office because they support these gigantic
[3:43:29.280 --> 3:43:32.800]  businesses that give them millions of dollars to fund their campaigns
[3:43:32.800 --> 3:43:35.600]  you know people that don't think that they're going to be in bed with these
[3:43:35.600 --> 3:43:37.840]  companies and that they're going to make decisions based on
[3:43:37.840 --> 3:43:41.760]  these companies you're crazy these guys are not going to give politicians
[3:43:41.760 --> 3:43:44.640]  millions and millions of dollars towards their campaigns if there's not
[3:43:44.640 --> 3:43:47.920]  it's something in it for them and the something in it for them is they make
[3:43:47.920 --> 3:43:51.440]  things illegal that can interfere with their business and natural things are
[3:43:51.440 --> 3:43:54.560]  the biggest the biggest one because you can't put a patent on marijuana
[3:43:54.560 --> 3:43:58.080]  so the idea is that if you made marijuana legal it would literally
[3:43:58.080 --> 3:44:01.440]  bankrupt the pharmaceutical industry because over a hundred different things
[3:44:01.440 --> 3:44:04.800]  that we have pills for you could just have pot for and people could grow it in
[3:44:04.800 --> 3:44:08.240]  their backyard that's the short answer that's the much more
[3:44:08.240 --> 3:44:12.240]  likely scenario absolutely and the half half a trillion dollars
[3:44:12.240 --> 3:44:16.160]  of opium money out of afghanistan every year is laundered
[3:44:16.160 --> 3:44:21.200]  and and and leveraged up to five trillion and so of course they can't
[3:44:21.200 --> 3:44:24.320]  decriminalize it because they are laundering the money
[3:44:24.320 --> 3:44:28.480]  and the only drug dealers they bust are the people who are cowboys
[3:44:28.480 --> 3:44:32.240]  and operate outside of the system i just wonder how the police feel
[3:44:32.240 --> 3:44:36.080]  busting teenagers with drugs cops are just doing their job you know that's
[3:44:36.080 --> 3:44:38.880]  the problem with cops is you have douchebags just like you have douchebags
[3:44:38.880 --> 3:44:41.360]  that work at kentucky fried chicken you know there's just going to be a certain
[3:44:41.360 --> 3:44:43.200]  percentage of the population are going to be idiots
[3:44:43.200 --> 3:44:46.960]  like there's a guy recently who arrested a 15 year old girl for taking
[3:44:46.960 --> 3:44:51.040]  photographs of her vajayjay and sending them to all the boys in class
[3:44:51.040 --> 3:44:54.480]  they arrested this young girl for child pornography
[3:44:54.480 --> 3:44:58.800]  they brought her to jail and because of public outrage they had to drop the case
[3:44:58.800 --> 3:45:02.640]  and they they charged her with one count of possession of criminal no no they do
[3:45:02.640 --> 3:45:05.840]  that all the time uh 16 year old girls show their breasts
[3:45:05.840 --> 3:45:08.720]  yeah and send it to their friends and they might need to get old trouble from
[3:45:08.720 --> 3:45:11.440]  their parents but certainly not arrested as a child
[3:45:11.440 --> 3:45:14.800]  pornography well it's those those cops those cops are dummies you know it's
[3:45:14.800 --> 3:45:17.200]  like you know you're gonna have that in all walks of life you're gonna be
[3:45:17.200 --> 3:45:20.000]  certain i agree but they're dummies with authority
[3:45:20.000 --> 3:45:23.680]  yeah with the corrupt system that protects them yes absolutely does
[3:45:23.680 --> 3:45:26.960]  protect them yeah they protect each other as well you know
[3:45:26.960 --> 3:45:30.720]  so yeah it's a terrible situation but i mean but i don't know i don't know what
[3:45:30.720 --> 3:45:34.240]  what the solution is well here's an article out of mclatchy newspapers
[3:45:34.240 --> 3:45:38.720]  they got the internal goldman sacks documents uh that goldman sacks who
[3:45:38.720 --> 3:45:41.360]  headed up the private fellow reserve the treasury department they had their
[3:45:41.360 --> 3:45:44.000]  people in all the government positions knowingly
[3:45:44.000 --> 3:45:47.040]  bet against the housing market while telling people to invest in it to
[3:45:47.040 --> 3:45:51.680]  implode the market so is dallas ready
[3:45:51.760 --> 3:45:55.680]  oh okay good you know that have you ever read matt hybe's articles about it
[3:45:55.680 --> 3:45:58.800]  yeah matt tatie writes articles making fun of me for 9 11 truth
[3:45:58.800 --> 3:46:02.240]  then he comes along and waters everything down on the rolling stone
[3:46:02.240 --> 3:46:05.840]  about the private fed and and everybody worships him but i'm glad he's coming
[3:46:05.840 --> 3:46:07.920]  around a little bit well i think that what he's saying
[3:46:07.920 --> 3:46:11.280]  about the financial institutions is pretty powerful because what he does is
[3:46:11.280 --> 3:46:14.160]  he breaks it down in a way that the average person can understand it like
[3:46:14.160 --> 3:46:17.200]  me i have no background in finance whatsoever
[3:46:17.200 --> 3:46:20.400]  barely paid attention in high school to mathematics i just
[3:46:20.400 --> 3:46:23.680]  my attitude was that if there's a calculator and there's batteries i don't
[3:46:23.680 --> 3:46:26.240]  need that i there's other things to think about i'm like i don't want to wait and
[3:46:26.240 --> 3:46:29.680]  you've done well in business job no i haven't i've just done well in comedy
[3:46:29.680 --> 3:46:31.760]  and other people have done well in business for me
[3:46:31.760 --> 3:46:35.440]  but you know that guy breaks the whole situation down in a way that someone
[3:46:35.440 --> 3:46:38.880]  like me who doesn't have a background in economics can understand it and it's
[3:46:38.880 --> 3:46:43.200]  it's incredibly corrupt incredibly deep but that's what i mean you i mean you
[3:46:43.200 --> 3:46:46.560]  talked about corruption evolves it always gets worse
[3:46:46.560 --> 3:46:49.520]  it's everywhere i mean that's really that the evidence that we see in the
[3:46:49.520 --> 3:46:52.480]  financial market the evidence that we see right now with
[3:46:52.480 --> 3:46:56.240]  you know the the economy falling apart all of this corruption
[3:46:56.240 --> 3:46:59.440]  is just a symptom of a much greater evil it's not like
[3:46:59.440 --> 3:47:03.760]  this is corrupt but then you get to world banking and government and oh
[3:47:03.760 --> 3:47:07.280]  that's not corrupt that part's okay no the whole system is in bed
[3:47:07.280 --> 3:47:10.720]  together yeah how did this idea ever get started that
[3:47:10.720 --> 3:47:15.040]  you can charge the balloon dad with the balloon kid for conspiracy
[3:47:15.040 --> 3:47:17.920]  as they're talking about doing last time i saw on the news
[3:47:17.920 --> 3:47:22.240]  a conspiracy can exist there to hype a reality tv show
[3:47:22.240 --> 3:47:26.240]  but big banks and elites that are in power they never conspire together well
[3:47:26.240 --> 3:47:29.760]  where's the story about the four tons of cocaine where is that why is that not
[3:47:29.760 --> 3:47:33.680]  in the news why are they not talking it was in roiders but nowhere in u.s media
[3:47:33.680 --> 3:47:37.840]  and they dropped it like that see uh nothing zero listen i see reports there
[3:47:37.840 --> 3:47:41.920]  was an ap report of an 18 wheeler in south texas with more than four tons of
[3:47:41.920 --> 3:47:45.680]  pure cocaine the state police busted it the fb i showed up took it and said
[3:47:45.680 --> 3:47:48.880]  we're not telling you who's it is
[3:47:48.880 --> 3:47:53.040]  i believe it you know that the whole uh what was his name gary webb the guy who
[3:47:53.040 --> 3:47:56.400]  was involved the meaner and they killed him they killed that guy that guy was
[3:47:56.400 --> 3:48:01.280]  flying cocaine back and forth from other countries to america for years
[3:48:01.280 --> 3:48:04.480]  well he reported on the guy they killed yeah bunch of guys they didn't he was
[3:48:04.480 --> 3:48:07.280]  about to nark they had him he was on his way to the courthouse
[3:48:07.280 --> 3:48:11.280]  he had george bush's phone number in his pocket when he was assassinated
[3:48:11.280 --> 3:48:15.520]  hi yeah that was one of the pilots and then web reported on that so they killed
[3:48:15.520 --> 3:48:19.120]  him yeah barry seals right that was a barry seal
[3:48:19.120 --> 3:48:23.200]  barry seals and then yeah and then web as well no i mean they kill people that
[3:48:23.200 --> 3:48:26.320]  talk about this guy ever what do you think about him he's the guy that i don't
[3:48:26.320 --> 3:48:29.680]  agree with his politics but his info on cia cocaine is good
[3:48:29.680 --> 3:48:33.600]  yeah i mean it's all rock solid that guy busted people he busted people was
[3:48:33.600 --> 3:48:38.240]  told to let it go because the cia was selling drugs i mean that's the big
[3:48:38.240 --> 3:48:42.240]  accusation was that the cia was well he had a cia girlfriend
[3:48:42.240 --> 3:48:46.800]  who was sitting there guiding the aircraft in to new orleans
[3:48:46.800 --> 3:48:51.520]  as they were yeah yeah that's the story told just all sorts of wild stuff
[3:48:51.520 --> 3:48:55.280]  that's it's all crazy it's amazing how little attention gets paid to this
[3:48:55.280 --> 3:48:58.240]  and how much attention gets paid to balloon boy and all these other stupid
[3:48:58.240 --> 3:49:01.680]  distractions i mean gay marriage you think that anybody in government
[3:49:01.680 --> 3:49:05.120]  really cares about gay marriage i mean is that really an issue it's a giant
[3:49:05.120 --> 3:49:08.160]  distraction well they do have those political football
[3:49:08.160 --> 3:49:10.560]  issues that are never going to be resolved the beach balls they just
[3:49:10.560 --> 3:49:13.520]  toss them out into the crowd for a big distraction you know like the economy
[3:49:13.520 --> 3:49:17.120]  is imploding why are we at war why are we at war oh gay marriage poof
[3:49:17.120 --> 3:49:21.120]  i know bird flu bird flu whatever it is any swine flu
[3:49:21.120 --> 3:49:25.680]  yeah it's a it's a it's amazing how obvious it is and that is also one of
[3:49:25.680 --> 3:49:28.800]  the reasons why drugs are illegal one of the reasons why drugs are illegal
[3:49:28.800 --> 3:49:32.400]  isn't just the economic factor of it it's the social implications
[3:49:32.400 --> 3:49:35.920]  of giving people things that change your consciousness giving people something
[3:49:35.920 --> 3:49:39.600]  that resets your consciousness and allows because the government once a
[3:49:39.600 --> 3:49:43.040]  corner on that to use tv and culture to do the programming
[3:49:43.040 --> 3:49:46.160]  they don't want you programming yourself and those don't buy and they want
[3:49:46.160 --> 3:49:49.200]  their riddling and their pros act that they know is deadly that well they
[3:49:49.200 --> 3:49:52.960]  also know they don't bring you unique ideas those those things make you
[3:49:52.960 --> 3:49:56.240]  sedate and they make you accept your situation and they make you calm
[3:49:56.240 --> 3:50:00.080]  what the drugs that the government is more afraid of are the drugs that aren't
[3:50:00.080 --> 3:50:03.440]  it's not like money drugs like there's a lot of money to be made they're scared
[3:50:03.440 --> 3:50:05.840]  of hallucinogens how much yeah how much money is there to be made in
[3:50:05.840 --> 3:50:09.120]  mushrooms i mean is there anybody got a mushroom no because i can grow
[3:50:09.120 --> 3:50:11.920]  everywhere yeah but how come why i mean how come they have
[3:50:11.920 --> 3:50:15.680]  cocaine empires and you ever watch like cocaine cowboys and there's no mushroom
[3:50:15.680 --> 3:50:18.000]  empires there's no that's because cocaine is
[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:22.160]  geographically limited to one area it's a perfect monopoly drug so out of the
[3:50:22.160 --> 3:50:25.760]  thousands of drugs it's cocaine and heroin the cia controls
[3:50:25.760 --> 3:50:29.040]  that is all over our streets yeah yeah that really probably is why it's so
[3:50:29.040 --> 3:50:32.720]  expensive because if you look at it i mean the making it illegal is what
[3:50:32.720 --> 3:50:37.120]  makes it valuable even though mushrooms are illegal
[3:50:37.120 --> 3:50:41.040]  i mean that's not the those they don't sell for much you know nobody's making a
[3:50:41.040 --> 3:50:43.600]  lot of money off of mushrooms that's kind of crazy when you think about it
[3:50:43.600 --> 3:50:46.080]  because mushrooms are way more fun than most drugs
[3:50:46.080 --> 3:50:50.480]  why aren't they hugely popular well listen it's okay for the government to
[3:50:50.480 --> 3:50:53.360]  shoot kids up with mercury give them riddling and prozac that eats holes in
[3:50:53.360 --> 3:50:57.680]  their brains and gives them heart palpitations but don't talk about that
[3:50:57.680 --> 3:51:01.760]  devil mushroom on the show here joe rogan's our guest stay with us

[3:55:25.840 --> 3:55:29.760]  guys about a swine flu shot because we've got a line around the block here in
[3:55:29.760 --> 3:55:34.480]  dallas to get them so i go get in line the cfr audio just got released a few
[3:55:34.480 --> 3:55:37.520]  days ago where the cfr council in farm relations is internally
[3:55:37.520 --> 3:55:41.040]  talking a month ago about people don't want it how do we do it
[3:55:41.040 --> 3:55:44.720]  will release limited amounts and then hype it up that it's only at certain
[3:55:44.720 --> 3:55:48.560]  places so the few idiots that want it all run down there to get it and it
[3:55:48.560 --> 3:55:51.440]  creates artificial scarcity like toy companies have been caught
[3:55:51.440 --> 3:55:55.360]  staging those christmas toy riots with local news media that's in on it and then
[3:55:55.360 --> 3:55:58.800]  they can make a billion bucks off the you know turbo dollar whatever it is
[3:55:58.800 --> 3:56:02.640]  everybody wants it and then everybody goes yeah so so false artificial
[3:56:02.640 --> 3:56:05.440]  scarcity was being created plus it's all over the news
[3:56:05.440 --> 3:56:09.120]  that they're forcing school children to take it all over the country when they
[3:56:09.120 --> 3:56:13.440]  get caught they say oops it was an accident so the truth is
[3:56:13.440 --> 3:56:16.960]  more than 60 percent of u.s doctors german doctors british doctors are
[3:56:16.960 --> 3:56:20.880]  refusing to take it nurses in new york sued so they wouldn't have to take it
[3:56:20.880 --> 3:56:26.000]  this stuff is dangerous there's all sorts of autoimmune problems the insert
[3:56:26.000 --> 3:56:29.280]  admits it has mercury it can cause gillian beret disorder can cause
[3:56:29.280 --> 3:56:31.840]  autoimmune disorders it can cause sterilization
[3:56:31.840 --> 3:56:37.120]  joe rogan a host of the ultimate fighting championship ufc what's your take
[3:56:37.120 --> 3:56:41.600]  on the vaccines well there's certainly a lot of money involved in vaccines and
[3:56:41.600 --> 3:56:44.480]  you have to look at that and anybody who doesn't look at that is a fool there
[3:56:44.480 --> 3:56:47.760]  is a lot of money to be made vaccinating all these people we're
[3:56:47.760 --> 3:56:52.080]  talking about billions of dollars nationwide and my friend steve is a
[3:56:52.080 --> 3:56:55.760]  doctor and my friend you know whenever i there's any issue in the news i call
[3:56:55.760 --> 3:56:57.920]  him up i've known him for like 20 years and i said what is the deal with the
[3:56:57.920 --> 3:57:01.760]  swine flu and he said here's the deal there was an issue going on in mexico
[3:57:01.760 --> 3:57:05.920]  the media jumped on the media said look there's a new flu in mexico
[3:57:05.920 --> 3:57:09.600]  it's very dangerous and only a few people had died from it in comparison to
[3:57:09.600 --> 3:57:14.400]  regular flu it was very minuscule in fact like the the the deaths the fatalities
[3:57:14.400 --> 3:57:18.320]  so he said what happens is the government sees that the media is following
[3:57:18.320 --> 3:57:21.440]  this stuff and they said well we have to cover our ass now so the government
[3:57:21.440 --> 3:57:25.600]  starts covering their ass and and preparing people for the swine flu
[3:57:25.600 --> 3:57:28.720]  and then the media says well look look what the government's doing and then it
[3:57:28.720 --> 3:57:32.640]  gets even crazier and then of course the companies that make these inoculations
[3:57:32.640 --> 3:57:36.720]  they come in like crazy gang joe you're right that that is part of what happened
[3:57:36.720 --> 3:57:39.840]  but the companies were already making the same h1n1
[3:57:39.840 --> 3:57:43.920]  a year ago before this happened and i covered in january on air but there was
[3:57:43.920 --> 3:57:47.600]  going to be a stage flu run because they were training for martial law drills
[3:57:47.600 --> 3:57:50.720]  all over the country the good news is the public hasn't bought it
[3:57:50.720 --> 3:57:53.920]  so they're having to pull back though obama did declare his emergency
[3:57:53.920 --> 3:57:58.880]  we document what's really going on info the republic at info wars dot com but i
[3:57:58.880 --> 3:58:03.200]  want to thank am 1360 for having us on richard good to be with you
[3:58:03.200 --> 3:58:08.800]  thanks alex b joe thanks man there goes joe rogan i was on for three seconds
[3:58:08.800 --> 3:58:13.440]  he said four words we beat him down no no no he wanted to interview me
[3:58:13.440 --> 3:58:16.080]  during the breaks but you during the breaks adam
[3:58:16.080 --> 3:58:19.840]  during the breaks i i i do a lot of radio interviews just like you do
[3:58:19.840 --> 3:58:23.520]  i mean i i bet you do interviews every week don't you yeah pretty much yeah
[3:58:23.520 --> 3:58:28.000]  so are you you think that this is all uh a scheme i know it is used to
[3:58:28.000 --> 3:58:31.520]  joe i have the documents back in one minute commercial free 20 minutes in
[3:58:31.520 --> 3:58:34.560]  overdrive totally only at prison planet dot tv
[3:58:34.560 --> 3:58:37.120]  and info wars dot com back live tomorrow for full
[3:58:37.120 --> 3:58:40.800]  transmission 11 a into 3 p.m central stay with us in overdrive
[3:58:40.800 --> 3:58:51.120]  with joe rogan you are listening to gcn visit gcn live dot com today
[3:58:51.120 --> 3:58:54.480]  have you ever wanted to generate your own supply of electrical power
[3:58:54.480 --> 3:58:58.080]  if so this is going to be the most important message you will ever hear
[3:58:58.080 --> 3:59:02.000]  solar power generators are now available from solutions from science in toms
[3:59:02.000 --> 3:59:04.720]  in illinois these emergency backup systems provide
[3:59:04.720 --> 3:59:07.200]  lifesaving electrical power when you need it most
[3:59:07.200 --> 3:59:11.440]  unlike gas generators a solar generator runs quietly emits no fumes and
[3:59:11.440 --> 3:59:14.880]  produces electricity for free it's like having an electric power plant
[3:59:14.880 --> 3:59:18.000]  running quietly in your own home run some pumps
[3:59:18.000 --> 3:59:21.760]  shortwave radios computers and even keep food from spoiling
[3:59:21.760 --> 3:59:25.200]  whether it's hurricanes ice storms brownouts or blackouts
[3:59:25.200 --> 3:59:28.320]  you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[3:59:28.320 --> 3:59:32.480]  when the power goes out you'll be ready with a solar power generator from
[3:59:32.480 --> 3:59:37.200]  solutions from science go to my solar backup dot com and get off
[3:59:37.200 --> 3:59:40.960]  the grid today that's my solar backup dot com
[3:59:40.960 --> 3:59:52.000]  or call 877-327-0365 877-327-0365 don't wait call today
[3:59:52.000 --> 3:59:57.600]  coast to coast direct from austin you're listening to the alex jones
[3:59:57.600 --> 4:00:03.520]  broadcasting network network
[4:00:27.600 --> 4:00:37.520]  so
[4:00:37.520 --> 4:00:41.680]  i am enjoying having joe rogan in studio we've got joy being here
[4:00:41.680 --> 4:00:45.520]  and we've got arie and we've got brian hey what are you
[4:00:45.520 --> 4:00:49.280]  does that check out joe rogan dot net i check out brian's website
[4:00:49.280 --> 4:00:53.280]  i check out arie's material and i don't see i see some photos and some video
[4:00:53.280 --> 4:00:56.160]  posted but this guy's shooting video at four o'clock in the morning when we're
[4:00:56.160 --> 4:00:59.600]  in los vegas i mean where is it what is all this video going into
[4:00:59.600 --> 4:01:03.680]  it's the new world order brian is the actual new world order chief
[4:01:03.680 --> 4:01:07.120]  he's the head guy it's like uh what was that movie with kaiser soze
[4:01:07.120 --> 4:01:09.920]  you know when you think that this loser is just a loser but it turns out he's
[4:01:09.920 --> 4:01:13.360]  kaiser soze that's brian's kaiser soze now i understand
[4:01:13.360 --> 4:01:16.960]  he's like a master of viral internet media he is the master
[4:01:16.960 --> 4:01:20.560]  he's the number one guy he's also the master hummingbirds he knows hummingbirds
[4:01:20.560 --> 4:01:23.840]  inside and out and i like hummingbirds he's a professional video editor he just
[4:01:23.840 --> 4:01:27.360]  makes brilliant little videos no i know but i'd like to see
[4:01:27.360 --> 4:01:30.800]  a big extended joe rogan behind the scenes
[4:01:30.800 --> 4:01:35.200]  yeah joe rogan mayhem most of the interesting stuff we do something with
[4:01:35.200 --> 4:01:38.640]  but a lot of it is hey let's go eat you know
[4:01:38.640 --> 4:01:41.840]  a lot of it is oh who farted you know i mean a lot of it is not that interesting
[4:01:41.840 --> 4:01:45.600]  all right joe we got 20 minutes left i am going to try to just sit back which is
[4:01:45.600 --> 4:01:49.440]  hard to do shut up come on let's let's work and i want joe rogan's view on the
[4:01:49.440 --> 4:01:52.880]  world technology advancing at an accelerated rate
[4:01:52.880 --> 4:01:57.200]  humans can't you know evolve psychologically to deal with it
[4:01:57.200 --> 4:02:00.960]  it's absolutely true okay well well you get where i'm going then talk about
[4:02:00.960 --> 4:02:04.480]  that that's a fascinating thing i mean if you look at you know
[4:02:04.480 --> 4:02:08.720]  physically how we have developed and evolved we haven't evolved that much
[4:02:08.720 --> 4:02:12.720]  over the last you know a thousand few thousand years but technology has just
[4:02:12.720 --> 4:02:16.160]  gone through the roof it's gotten to a crazy place where we have this
[4:02:16.160 --> 4:02:19.600]  unbelievable control over our environment the ability to construct
[4:02:19.600 --> 4:02:22.720]  giant buildings and send photos through the air i mean
[4:02:22.720 --> 4:02:27.360]  it's it's a it's a very very heady thing you know and i think it would take like
[4:02:27.360 --> 4:02:31.280]  an incredibly enlightened society just to deal with what we're capable of
[4:02:31.280 --> 4:02:34.720]  right now never mind what's coming in the future as this
[4:02:34.720 --> 4:02:39.440]  you know exponentially increasing technology you know the the the the the
[4:02:39.440 --> 4:02:42.080]  advancement the you know the innovation it's just
[4:02:42.080 --> 4:02:45.200]  it's all coming at like this incredibly rapid pace
[4:02:45.200 --> 4:02:50.000]  and you know physically we're like the same emotionally we're still tribal monkeys
[4:02:50.000 --> 4:02:53.280]  you know but we have this incredible power now and that's why a lot of
[4:02:53.280 --> 4:02:57.120]  scientists believe we won't get to it to a type one society
[4:02:57.120 --> 4:03:00.400]  meaning a society that survives and gets off planet that we're probably going to
[4:03:00.400 --> 4:03:03.600]  destroy ourselves well it's either that or telepathy
[4:03:03.600 --> 4:03:07.040]  those are the two possibilities either people that they're you know the idea
[4:03:07.040 --> 4:03:10.320]  of telepathy is ridiculous to people you know the idea it's like
[4:03:10.320 --> 4:03:14.080]  ghosts or bigfoot or anything nonsense anything that we don't have hard proof
[4:03:14.080 --> 4:03:17.760]  of you know you're bringing up but the studies show it's real the studies do
[4:03:17.760 --> 4:03:21.120]  show any it could certainly be real if you can smell
[4:03:21.120 --> 4:03:24.560]  things the idea that you can take something you can detect
[4:03:24.560 --> 4:03:28.320]  something with your nose that isn't you can't see it but you know when somebody's
[4:03:28.320 --> 4:03:31.920]  looking through your window at night sometimes i mean i can't tell you how
[4:03:31.920 --> 4:03:35.680]  many times i have known somebody's looking at me
[4:03:35.680 --> 4:03:39.280]  when i'm walking around on my family ran say that that is the number one way
[4:03:39.280 --> 4:03:42.640]  that they can show that there is some sort of a connection between human beings
[4:03:42.640 --> 4:03:45.680]  telepathically is the ability to recognize when someone's staring at you
[4:03:45.680 --> 4:03:49.520]  they've done scientific studies on that and they've proven be honest look 100
[4:03:49.520 --> 4:03:53.040]  percent of the time when i'm in a restaurant and i feel somebody staring
[4:03:53.040 --> 4:03:55.360]  at me especially if it's with bad intent there's some
[4:03:55.360 --> 4:03:58.080]  redneck doesn't like me or something i'll feel it and i'll turn around and
[4:03:58.080 --> 4:04:01.040]  they'll be going and we'll go yeah that's a weird thing isn't it it's a weird
[4:04:01.040 --> 4:04:05.040]  thing that we can detect that you know and i think that is just look at one
[4:04:05.040 --> 4:04:08.320]  point in time we couldn't communicate but if you believe in evolution you have
[4:04:08.320 --> 4:04:11.440]  to believe that at one point time we were monkeys that just grunted and made
[4:04:11.440 --> 4:04:14.240]  noises and swung from trees and then something happened
[4:04:14.240 --> 4:04:16.880]  where we went from that to where we are now
[4:04:16.880 --> 4:04:20.960]  where we figured out not just one but dozens and dozens of systems of
[4:04:20.960 --> 4:04:23.920]  communication all over the world where we write little symbols that mean
[4:04:23.920 --> 4:04:26.800]  certain things and we can say noises with our
[4:04:26.800 --> 4:04:30.000]  mouth and we understand what we're trying to say because of that i mean that
[4:04:30.000 --> 4:04:33.360]  that alone that that incredible ability to communicate i mean that's
[4:04:33.360 --> 4:04:37.600]  that's a gigantic but birds know two days before an earthquake
[4:04:37.600 --> 4:04:42.560]  or before a tornado and and dolphins i mean i don't even think it's so much as
[4:04:42.560 --> 4:04:47.200]  a primitive thing but something we always had and are developing
[4:04:47.200 --> 4:04:50.480]  because our five senses are in such a limited spectrum
[4:04:50.480 --> 4:04:54.080]  of what the mathematics show that there is dimensionally yeah i always say that
[4:04:54.080 --> 4:04:57.360]  i wish we've talked about this on a show before i call it the fart principle
[4:04:57.360 --> 4:05:01.200]  like the idea that if someone farted and you didn't have a nose and you didn't
[4:05:01.200 --> 4:05:04.000]  hear it you'd have no idea you'd be sitting in this horrible
[4:05:04.000 --> 4:05:07.760]  smell right you'd have no idea but how do we not know
[4:05:07.760 --> 4:05:10.560]  that there aren't an infinite number of senses
[4:05:10.560 --> 4:05:15.040]  that we just don't we're not we don't have we're not capable of detecting
[4:05:15.040 --> 4:05:19.600]  all these other things that are around us all the time our imagination limits us
[4:05:19.600 --> 4:05:24.560]  to thinking that what we what we know is all that there is you know that smell
[4:05:24.560 --> 4:05:27.840]  and touch and feel and then what we see in front of us is all that there is but
[4:05:27.840 --> 4:05:30.800]  it's very possible that our entire existence is just
[4:05:30.800 --> 4:05:36.400]  one tiny spot on the radio dial and that there's an infinite number of radio
[4:05:36.400 --> 4:05:39.200]  stations there's an infinite number of of realities
[4:05:39.200 --> 4:05:42.080]  around us all the time we just we just can't tune into it
[4:05:42.080 --> 4:05:46.640]  that we're just oblivious to to what we can't detect we're a very thin slice
[4:05:46.640 --> 4:05:49.360]  yeah but what it what what technology may be
[4:05:49.360 --> 4:05:53.040]  is a breaking of those barriers what what we might be able to do with like
[4:05:53.040 --> 4:05:58.160]  the large hadron collider and all this crazy manipulation of matter what we
[4:05:58.160 --> 4:06:01.360]  might be able to figure out a way to break into other dimensions
[4:06:01.360 --> 4:06:06.400]  and the mathematics shows that stuff a hundred years ago developed the a-bomb
[4:06:06.400 --> 4:06:10.560]  equations on a chalkboard this is a exponential
[4:06:10.560 --> 4:06:14.640]  multi-level not one jump but several jumps past that and they believe
[4:06:14.640 --> 4:06:17.440]  scientists that work there are sabotaging it because they've had
[4:06:17.440 --> 4:06:20.560]  blow-ups and disasters and they can't get the thing started
[4:06:20.560 --> 4:06:23.920]  it's not just that it's so giant they're not just going to be slamming heavy
[4:06:23.920 --> 4:06:27.280]  particles in the blocks of lead they're going to be accelerating uranium
[4:06:27.280 --> 4:06:31.760]  plutonium and other very explosive unstable isotopes
[4:06:31.760 --> 4:06:36.640]  into each other at light speed and and the scientists say well it could create
[4:06:36.640 --> 4:06:40.640]  a black hole it could create a strangely it could create a quantum particle
[4:06:40.640 --> 4:06:43.920]  that sinks to the center of the earth and begins replicating
[4:06:43.920 --> 4:06:48.560]  and then boom the whole planet's gone we can't help it we have this incredible
[4:06:48.560 --> 4:06:51.680]  desire to change things and i think it's much like
[4:06:51.680 --> 4:06:55.200]  a caterpillar does not recognize that it's going to become a butterfly they're
[4:06:55.200 --> 4:06:58.080]  not at least we don't think they are they're not aware of it they just do
[4:06:58.080 --> 4:07:00.800]  what they have to do they make their cocoon and then they go they change i
[4:07:00.800 --> 4:07:04.720]  agree with you all of this technology is a metamorphosis and the elite believe
[4:07:04.720 --> 4:07:07.520]  that and we covered that in my film in-game blueprint for global
[4:07:07.520 --> 4:07:10.560]  enslavement and they openly i mean all the top all the top
[4:07:10.560 --> 4:07:14.080]  scientists future is government you and people they say they want to exterminate
[4:07:14.080 --> 4:07:18.240]  90 of us and allow that 10 to fuse with the man-machine
[4:07:18.240 --> 4:07:22.560]  interface and then take off to the stars now whether that's real or not
[4:07:22.560 --> 4:07:26.240]  that's what the elite believe and they already have live extension technologies
[4:07:26.240 --> 4:07:29.440]  they don't want the public to have access to that it sounds ridiculous but
[4:07:29.440 --> 4:07:33.440]  from where we are it's not as big of a leap as where we're living or what
[4:07:33.440 --> 4:07:36.880]  we're the the era we're living in right now in comparison to
[4:07:36.880 --> 4:07:40.560]  people that we know existed like the indians or cavemen computers would be
[4:07:40.560 --> 4:07:43.600]  magic to them yeah man i mean just the ability to
[4:07:43.600 --> 4:07:46.560]  download something off the internet on your iphone i mean that is
[4:07:46.560 --> 4:07:50.720]  one of the craziest things that's ever existed the google search
[4:07:50.720 --> 4:07:54.800]  the ability to take your phone google something find out information on a
[4:07:54.800 --> 4:07:57.760]  topic instantaneously they didn't even have that on
[4:07:57.760 --> 4:08:01.680]  star track i mean that is such a gigantic monumental leap
[4:08:01.680 --> 4:08:05.440]  of access to information and when mcjellan
[4:08:05.440 --> 4:08:10.880]  600 years ago or 400 years ago circumnavigated the entire world
[4:08:10.880 --> 4:08:14.080]  they didn't even know what was out there right yeah they just took chances he
[4:08:14.080 --> 4:08:17.120]  didn't make it back almost everyone died when the ship
[4:08:17.120 --> 4:08:21.920]  came back to portugal it was rotting and falling apart only a few guys were alive
[4:08:21.920 --> 4:08:25.280]  nuts but imagine they had no idea he said i think it's round
[4:08:25.280 --> 4:08:28.640]  and i'm going around it yeah they were have those rats on board with them
[4:08:28.640 --> 4:08:31.760]  they're all getting scurvy because nobody had vitamin c made that those
[4:08:31.760 --> 4:08:36.160]  those early traveler dudes were nuts well the really nutty idea is the idea of
[4:08:36.160 --> 4:08:39.840]  guys like graham hancock guys who believe that those early traveler dudes
[4:08:39.840 --> 4:08:43.120]  were just this generation's version of that and that there's been
[4:08:43.120 --> 4:08:46.400]  many many thousands of years of civilization that we don't even know
[4:08:46.400 --> 4:08:49.760]  about because there was a lot of evidence does show that it gets built up
[4:08:49.760 --> 4:08:53.440]  and then destroyed i mean look we know that there's hundreds of thousands of
[4:08:53.440 --> 4:08:56.880]  near-earth objects between mars and jupiter that could just crush this
[4:08:56.880 --> 4:08:59.360]  earth you know we know it's happening look at shatterton's
[4:08:59.360 --> 4:09:03.120]  shoemaker levy comments yeah yeah i mean look at all yeah look at that and also
[4:09:03.120 --> 4:09:06.720]  look at what we know has happened on this planet that comes from this planet
[4:09:06.720 --> 4:09:10.400]  like like yellowstone like they've just figured out like within the last decade
[4:09:10.400 --> 4:09:14.240]  that yellowstone is this gigantic caldera volcano that's 600
[4:09:14.240 --> 4:09:18.160]  kilometers across and every time it but it's like a continent killer
[4:09:18.160 --> 4:09:21.920]  it blows every six to 800 000 years and it kills everything on the continent
[4:09:21.920 --> 4:09:25.760]  and it happened 600 000 years ago like and the scientist i've had top
[4:09:25.760 --> 4:09:29.760]  volcanologist on the government admits that's true and the public has a built
[4:09:29.760 --> 4:09:32.960]  in denial switch right where i get emails saying you're a liar
[4:09:32.960 --> 4:09:36.560]  yellowstone is not a caldera well it's like a gigantic game of musical
[4:09:36.560 --> 4:09:41.440]  chairs it's like we hope that we are not going to be here when the music stops
[4:09:41.440 --> 4:09:44.960]  you know that's what we hope that the while our life is here and while our
[4:09:44.960 --> 4:09:47.600]  family's life is here and our grandchildren everything's going to be
[4:09:47.600 --> 4:09:51.360]  okay i think that life on earth is very much
[4:09:51.360 --> 4:09:55.040]  like an anthill in the field you know the ants in that anthill
[4:09:55.040 --> 4:09:58.480]  they have known nothing other than that anthill they've only been alive for
[4:09:58.480 --> 4:10:01.120]  a couple weeks as long as they've been alive that anthill's been there
[4:10:01.120 --> 4:10:05.280]  and that anthill sustains them all and they think this is just how it always is
[4:10:05.280 --> 4:10:08.880]  and then some little kid walks by sees that anthill and stomps on it one day
[4:10:08.880 --> 4:10:11.440]  just out of the blue and everything changes forever
[4:10:11.440 --> 4:10:14.480]  and the ant dance never saw it coming they never knew it was going to happen
[4:10:14.480 --> 4:10:16.320]  they would never would have if they had consciousness
[4:10:16.320 --> 4:10:19.680]  they never would have imagined it well there's so many things that can happen
[4:10:19.680 --> 4:10:23.520]  to stomp our anthill there's meteors there's earthquakes there's caldera
[4:10:23.520 --> 4:10:26.720]  volcanoes the the gigantic super volcano that is
[4:10:26.720 --> 4:10:30.400]  yellowstone park did you know germany has a super caldera
[4:10:30.400 --> 4:10:34.160]  did it they're all over the planet i'm sure i mean it makes sense i mean if you
[4:10:34.160 --> 4:10:38.000]  look at mountains i mean where did those mountains come from they came from
[4:10:38.000 --> 4:10:41.680]  activity you know they raise up and just takes a long ass time
[4:10:41.680 --> 4:10:45.360]  and we're only here on this planet for a blip and by the way until
[4:10:45.360 --> 4:10:52.000]  the nineties um when saturn got hit by that comet that broke in all those
[4:10:52.000 --> 4:10:55.600]  pieces scientists argued and said no only every
[4:10:55.600 --> 4:10:59.360]  billion years we get hit by a big object now because of the satellites and
[4:10:59.360 --> 4:11:03.360]  everything they know we get hit every couple hundred years
[4:11:03.360 --> 4:11:08.960]  by gigantic objects and instead the government's
[4:11:08.960 --> 4:11:12.720]  worried about spying on the citizens and controlling us instead of dealing with
[4:11:12.720 --> 4:11:16.000]  all these objects i know what they can do man i don't know what they can do i
[4:11:16.000 --> 4:11:20.880]  think the the the idea of monitoring the entire 360 degrees of
[4:11:20.880 --> 4:11:24.400]  earth sky is virtually impossible if they turn the satellites around and start
[4:11:24.400 --> 4:11:27.040]  to try and they could you think so yeah i've seen the
[4:11:27.040 --> 4:11:30.240]  studies on it well then what do you do when one's coming you got some five
[4:11:30.240 --> 4:11:34.000]  mile wide hunk of metal that's heading towards the earth what do you do you put
[4:11:34.000 --> 4:11:36.320]  weapon systems in space but then you don't want to
[4:11:36.320 --> 4:11:39.200]  that there are treaties against that because whoever has weapon systems can
[4:11:39.200 --> 4:11:43.040]  turn them back to us oh it's also don't worry joe the
[4:11:43.040 --> 4:11:46.400]  weapon systems are there oh i'm sure they are i mean you know i've read all
[4:11:46.400 --> 4:11:49.200]  that stuff about the star wars scientists how many different scientists
[4:11:49.200 --> 4:11:53.760]  turned out missing or dead some strange you know bob bowman's in the hospital
[4:11:53.760 --> 4:11:57.440]  right now he's actually in fall the republic he was the head of star wars
[4:11:57.440 --> 4:11:59.680]  and he won't talk about it when i talked to him in private but he said i'll
[4:11:59.680 --> 4:12:03.120]  tell you what's declassified because nsa spokesman and space command
[4:12:03.120 --> 4:12:06.640]  spokesman have have let some of it out when he was there in the late 70s they
[4:12:06.640 --> 4:12:08.800]  announced in the 80s it was around the 70s
[4:12:08.800 --> 4:12:16.160]  they had an entire fleet of unmanned aircraft up there
[4:12:16.160 --> 4:12:20.160]  black manned space planes but they don't use nuclear weapons they use meteor
[4:12:20.160 --> 4:12:24.640]  guns and they drop solid du sabos into orbit that
[4:12:24.640 --> 4:12:28.640]  accelerate to 30 000 miles an hour and they can kill people five miles
[4:12:28.640 --> 4:12:31.600]  under the ground and it's a global decapitation weapon where they can
[4:12:31.600 --> 4:12:34.960]  wipe out the whole leadership of the world in a matter of minutes
[4:12:34.960 --> 4:12:39.280]  wow and that's all real stuff that's ultra ultra top secret the stuff that's
[4:12:39.280 --> 4:12:42.240]  leaked young meteor guns that sounds like an
[4:12:42.240 --> 4:12:46.240]  episode of scooby-doo well no no no i mean it
[4:12:46.240 --> 4:12:49.520]  it doesn't exist it has a rocket booster on the back
[4:12:49.520 --> 4:12:54.640]  of say a hundred pound sabo uh sabo
[4:12:54.640 --> 4:12:58.400]  that's say where you take a 223 round and shoot it out of a 50 caliber round so
[4:12:58.400 --> 4:13:01.600]  it has even more acceleration power
[4:13:01.600 --> 4:13:05.920]  and it's a sabo because it's got a rocket booster on it so it would speed up to
[4:13:05.920 --> 4:13:11.120]  18 20 000 miles an hour instead 30 35 40 000 miles an hour the space planes are
[4:13:11.120 --> 4:13:14.000]  already going that is like the speed of meteors right
[4:13:14.000 --> 4:13:16.960]  45 000 miles and that's why it's called a meteor gun because
[4:13:16.960 --> 4:13:20.080]  wow because when these birds are about to attack
[4:13:20.080 --> 4:13:24.720]  they accelerate coming in at an angle on the atmosphere to accelerate so there's
[4:13:24.720 --> 4:13:27.600]  already a greater acceleration than the meteor would normally have then they
[4:13:27.600 --> 4:13:31.600]  fire with a high-powered rocket booster a solid du round
[4:13:31.600 --> 4:13:35.120]  which with its kinetic energy when it hits has the power of a medium yield
[4:13:35.120 --> 4:13:40.080]  nuclear weapon god damn i believe it you know i mean
[4:13:40.080 --> 4:13:43.040]  i believe that it's possible i believe if they're if they're willing to
[4:13:43.040 --> 4:13:45.840]  blow up Hiroshima and Nagasaki the way they did
[4:13:45.840 --> 4:13:48.800]  why wouldn't they come up with something like that you know believe me the nsa
[4:13:48.800 --> 4:13:51.920]  will be watching this later joe what do you want to you want to say hi to him i
[4:13:51.920 --> 4:13:55.440]  want to say i'm a a true patriot i pay my taxes
[4:13:55.440 --> 4:14:00.080]  leave me alone please what are you gonna say you know i mean
[4:14:00.080 --> 4:14:04.320]  these the the real problem is that we have we're moving in a certain direction
[4:14:04.320 --> 4:14:07.360]  we've been moving in this direction for a long time in this in this
[4:14:07.360 --> 4:14:10.640]  society and in virtually every society that's ever existed
[4:14:10.640 --> 4:14:14.000]  every society that has incredible power eventually winds up
[4:14:14.000 --> 4:14:17.680]  going into corruption and falling apart every empire collapses
[4:14:17.680 --> 4:14:23.040]  and it all it's because of corruption exactly but this scientific dictatorship
[4:14:23.040 --> 4:14:26.560]  admits in their public documents that they've studied all of that
[4:14:26.560 --> 4:14:29.840]  and they've built a scientific dictatorship so people can't get out of it
[4:14:29.840 --> 4:14:33.120]  joe i have hundreds always you know we we joke about documents but i have
[4:14:33.120 --> 4:14:36.960]  hundreds of documents textbooks government books and reports
[4:14:36.960 --> 4:14:41.600]  un documents pentagon documents this was written by the white house science
[4:14:41.600 --> 4:14:45.520]  are john p holdren and it was written by one of bush's advisors
[4:14:45.520 --> 4:14:49.600]  bush senior paul are early this calls for putting sterilants in the water to
[4:14:49.600 --> 4:14:53.360]  sterilize people the vaccines poisoning us world
[4:14:53.360 --> 4:14:56.880]  population reductions of 80 percent it is real
[4:14:56.880 --> 4:15:00.800]  and a lot of people can rationalize and say yeah there are too many people
[4:15:00.800 --> 4:15:03.920]  instead of understanding weight i'm under attack too
[4:15:03.920 --> 4:15:08.000]  they are attacking us and this guy recently declassified chemtrails
[4:15:08.000 --> 4:15:11.600]  and it made almost no news and said yeah we've been spraying with barium salts
[4:15:11.600 --> 4:15:14.400]  and aluminum dioxide what do you say to that what is what is the chemtrails
[4:15:14.400 --> 4:15:16.400]  what's the purpose of the chemtrails is it
[4:15:16.400 --> 4:15:22.560]  is it weather control yes yes he says geo engineering or terraforming to save
[4:15:22.560 --> 4:15:26.400]  us from global warming there's certainly a difference in the way the clouds look
[4:15:26.400 --> 4:15:29.760]  you know if you look at some clouds that are way up high they
[4:15:29.760 --> 4:15:33.840]  or rather you know some trails from jets it's like they dissipate they they're
[4:15:33.840 --> 4:15:37.200]  in the air like they always have been and then as the plane is moving you can
[4:15:37.200 --> 4:15:40.640]  actually see them dissipate but then you have these other ones that like they
[4:15:40.640 --> 4:15:43.600]  linger and they spread out and they literally become clouds
[4:15:43.600 --> 4:15:47.200]  and la those they're everywhere you know i don't know what that is i did
[4:15:47.200 --> 4:15:50.560]  honestly i have not looked into it well the incredible thing is scientists that
[4:15:50.560 --> 4:15:53.520]  were outside the government did test it did look at it they said it's barium
[4:15:53.520 --> 4:15:56.560]  salts how did they test it they went up in the air and scooped it up they used
[4:15:56.560 --> 4:16:00.400]  aircraft and also got ground samples and they said this is barium salts
[4:16:00.400 --> 4:16:05.120]  aluminum dioxide weather modification nuclei they declassified some of it five
[4:16:05.120 --> 4:16:08.080]  years ago i got ben livens and the father or weather weapons on
[4:16:08.080 --> 4:16:13.760]  then uh eight months ago poldron the white house science argues a press conference
[4:16:13.760 --> 4:16:17.920]  says we've been studying it and it's aluminum dioxide barium salts
[4:16:17.920 --> 4:16:23.120]  we're doing it to save you and it turns out a guy got a Nobel prize in 92 for
[4:16:23.120 --> 4:16:25.840]  developing it but the point is there's a giant
[4:16:25.840 --> 4:16:30.000]  weather modification program going on they finally admit it and it's no big
[4:16:30.000 --> 4:16:34.000]  deal that's pretty crazy
[4:16:34.000 --> 4:16:37.520]  joe in the last five minutes or so we have in the special transmission i want
[4:16:37.520 --> 4:16:40.240]  to thank you for coming in i know you're a guy that loves freedom
[4:16:40.240 --> 4:16:44.480]  and and is against them who hates freedom the globalist hate freedom
[4:16:44.480 --> 4:16:47.600]  no one's sitting around going mad i hate freedom and maybe prisoners that get
[4:16:47.600 --> 4:16:50.960]  institutionalized well the establishment the establishment doesn't
[4:16:50.960 --> 4:16:55.200]  like freedom they want to condition people brainwash them control them
[4:16:55.200 --> 4:16:57.600]  let's spend some time here on some lighter notes
[4:16:57.600 --> 4:17:01.280]  okay uh is brach lesnar ever going to fight fedor well brach lesnar right now
[4:17:01.280 --> 4:17:04.800]  as mononucleosis brach lesnar has not been able to train and they've
[4:17:04.800 --> 4:17:08.400]  postponed his fight he was supposed to be fighting shane carwin
[4:17:08.400 --> 4:17:12.000]  and uh that was in november and they had a postpone to january now there's
[4:17:12.000 --> 4:17:14.960]  talk that they may have to postpone it even further if he can't train
[4:17:14.960 --> 4:17:17.920]  because he's been really sick he hasn't been able to train and then
[4:17:17.920 --> 4:17:22.160]  lesnar or shane carwin rather had a h1n one he lost like 20 pounds due to the
[4:17:22.160 --> 4:17:25.120]  flu so uh it's you know rocks in a bad
[4:17:25.120 --> 4:17:27.280]  situation right now there's a bunch of guys that have mono
[4:17:27.280 --> 4:17:31.920]  i've heard it um my friend uh is a uh one of the members of uh jeremy
[4:17:31.920 --> 4:17:34.800]  horn's uh jeremy horn's a pretty famous mma
[4:17:34.800 --> 4:17:38.640]  fighter and uh at least two guys from his gym came down with mono
[4:17:38.640 --> 4:17:43.520]  so why spreading uh you know i think mono is uh it's an infectious disease
[4:17:43.520 --> 4:17:46.720]  right it's yeah you can transmit it from person to person and these guys you
[4:17:46.720 --> 4:17:50.080]  know when you're training you're doing jujitsu and wrestling with each other
[4:17:50.080 --> 4:17:53.520]  that's a lot of sweating on each other and those you get each other's bugs you
[4:17:53.520 --> 4:17:57.120]  know that's why you never want to do jujitsu where the guy's got a cold
[4:17:57.120 --> 4:17:59.840]  because you're going to get his cold you sweat on each other you know i mean
[4:17:59.840 --> 4:18:04.640]  it's kind of gross and think about it i hear you're a pretty good jujitsu guy
[4:18:04.640 --> 4:18:08.400]  i'm pretty good i'm decent you know for guys who aren't good i'm
[4:18:08.400 --> 4:18:12.800]  good didn't you wasn't there some talk about you
[4:18:12.800 --> 4:18:16.880]  and uh fighting some movie star yeah it was wesley snipes yeah
[4:18:16.880 --> 4:18:20.160]  yeah it was his idea but it uh he changed his mind
[4:18:20.160 --> 4:18:23.840]  but i was training for it i just thought he doesn't know jujitsu
[4:18:23.840 --> 4:18:26.480]  if you don't know jujitsu and someone grabs a whole of you it's like what are
[4:18:26.480 --> 4:18:30.880]  you gonna do you're gonna just add lib your way out of this i'm gonna choke you
[4:18:30.880 --> 4:18:34.800]  you don't know what you're doing jujitsu is like a long process it takes a long
[4:18:34.800 --> 4:18:37.920]  time to learn and someone who really doesn't understand it
[4:18:37.920 --> 4:18:41.040]  he has no knowledge of it at all if you watch the early UFC's you see how that
[4:18:41.040 --> 4:18:43.200]  goes you know hoist gracey gets on top of you and
[4:18:43.200 --> 4:18:47.520]  chokes you out that's what happens it's a it's a very complex martial art if you
[4:18:47.520 --> 4:18:49.840]  don't understand it or at least have some defense
[4:18:49.840 --> 4:18:53.840]  you're in a lot of trouble so it's it's more like chess versus
[4:18:53.840 --> 4:18:57.120]  it's technique it's technique and an understanding of the positions and most
[4:18:57.120 --> 4:19:01.200]  people just don't know what to do and your natural instincts will betray you
[4:19:01.200 --> 4:19:04.880]  every time if you don't know jujitsu and someone does and you roll with them
[4:19:04.880 --> 4:19:08.000]  every single time your your natural instincts give you up you don't realize
[4:19:08.000 --> 4:19:10.960]  that you're making mistakes you don't know what you're defending against you
[4:19:10.960 --> 4:19:13.520]  don't know what's coming so you don't know how to put yourself
[4:19:13.520 --> 4:19:16.640]  in the right position so you give up a position and if you give up a position
[4:19:16.640 --> 4:19:19.600]  with a guy who knows jujitsu he's gonna tap you out it's just
[4:19:19.600 --> 4:19:24.000]  just how it goes it's a helpless feeling one of the when i first learned jujitsu
[4:19:24.000 --> 4:19:28.080]  uh starting out as like a white belt i remember just just getting dominated by
[4:19:28.080 --> 4:19:32.080]  guys where they would just crush you they would just grab you get on top of you
[4:19:32.080 --> 4:19:35.440]  and choke you and there's nothing you can do about it and it's a horribly
[4:19:35.440 --> 4:19:38.880]  helpless feeling you know arie is uh getting pretty good now arie's a
[4:19:38.880 --> 4:19:41.920]  blue belt and are you blue belt yeah no but he's
[4:19:41.920 --> 4:19:44.560]  tapped some people you've tapped some people right he's been doing it for a
[4:19:44.560 --> 4:19:49.200]  couple years but when arie started out not only was arie like not doing any
[4:19:49.200 --> 4:19:51.680]  sports he wasn't doing anything he was smoking cigarettes
[4:19:51.680 --> 4:19:56.800]  and he was just you played basketball every now and then how often
[4:19:56.800 --> 4:20:00.800]  once or twice a week folks basketball okay so he played a little basketball
[4:20:00.800 --> 4:20:04.640]  but you know i mean he went from no martial arts experience whatsoever to
[4:20:04.640 --> 4:20:09.120]  you know actually tapping guys out young in there i'm proud of him so it's
[4:20:09.120 --> 4:20:12.080]  really good for people for self-defense yes it's great for self-defense and
[4:20:12.080 --> 4:20:14.560]  it's also great for exercise because it's really fun
[4:20:14.560 --> 4:20:17.840]  it's interesting you know what's that if you're looking at rape
[4:20:17.840 --> 4:20:24.000]  yeah if you're looking to get good at rape it's the best boy or girl whatever
[4:20:24.000 --> 4:20:28.880]  you're trying to do um it's it's it's uh it's a fascinating sport
[4:20:28.880 --> 4:20:32.240]  it's a fascinating martial art because it's a whole series of movements and
[4:20:32.240 --> 4:20:35.680]  it's a never-ending like me and a buddy of mine were we're just
[4:20:35.680 --> 4:20:38.400]  drilling a new move the other day and we're talking about it he's a brown
[4:20:38.400 --> 4:20:41.120]  belt i'm a brown belt too and he's like it never ends there's
[4:20:41.120 --> 4:20:44.160]  there's always a new move there's a new sweep and there's a new sweep that we
[4:20:44.160 --> 4:20:47.280]  were learning the other day it's just this revolutionary new sweep
[4:20:47.280 --> 4:20:50.240]  and everybody's like man how did i not see this before but it's always been
[4:20:50.240 --> 4:20:53.920]  there it's just the movements of people when you have
[4:20:53.920 --> 4:20:57.600]  unlimited mobility with your body you can move especially if you're really
[4:20:57.600 --> 4:21:02.000]  flexible you move your body in a certain way and then you got two arms to attack
[4:21:02.000 --> 4:21:05.920]  two legs to attack and the neck and there's so many different possibilities
[4:21:05.920 --> 4:21:09.440]  so many different ways to attack someone it's really like a kinetic game of
[4:21:09.440 --> 4:21:13.760]  chess it really is wow that is and a lot of people
[4:21:13.760 --> 4:21:17.120]  a lot of people aren't looking for a fight so they never train in any type of
[4:21:17.120 --> 4:21:20.960]  martial art but it's stupid but but everybody should get their their
[4:21:20.960 --> 4:21:23.520]  girls their boys everybody should be trained to
[4:21:23.520 --> 4:21:27.360]  defend yourself yes it's very it's always important to be the one who
[4:21:27.360 --> 4:21:29.440]  makes the decision whether or not you get hurt
[4:21:29.440 --> 4:21:32.240]  you know if some guy can just throttle you and you don't know how to defend
[4:21:32.240 --> 4:21:35.760]  yourself you're in a terrible situation you don't know how to defend yourself
[4:21:35.760 --> 4:21:40.240]  you know you you you could run into some nut and some nut decides to beat you up
[4:21:40.240 --> 4:21:42.640]  i mean i've seen it happen before where guys just get
[4:21:42.640 --> 4:21:46.080]  they're crying and they're begging to the guys kicking them when they're down
[4:21:46.080 --> 4:21:49.360]  have you ever seen a situation like that oh yeah horrible to watch to watch a
[4:21:49.360 --> 4:21:52.400]  guy have his his manhood taken away by someone just because he doesn't know
[4:21:52.400 --> 4:21:55.680]  how to defend himself you know and it's most of the time you're never
[4:21:55.680 --> 4:21:58.400]  going to run into that situation most of the time if you hang out in good
[4:21:58.400 --> 4:22:02.160]  circles you're going to live your life and not have to worry about but you might
[4:22:02.160 --> 4:22:05.760]  you know you might i don't know man this is ag i grew up in dallas i don't know
[4:22:05.760 --> 4:22:08.400]  if it's still like that up there but there are a lot of really bad people
[4:22:08.400 --> 4:22:10.960]  that like to get in fights there's a lot of people all over the country that are
[4:22:10.960 --> 4:22:13.440]  angry man there's people that have terrible jobs
[4:22:13.440 --> 4:22:16.560]  terrible relationships and terrible upbrings and they want to kick your
[4:22:16.560 --> 4:22:19.040]  ass they don't care they want to kick your ass you know and you got to be
[4:22:19.040 --> 4:22:22.320]  aware of those no i was like a nice little kid i was like 10 11 12 and
[4:22:22.320 --> 4:22:25.920]  kids like kids were like five six years older would beat me up
[4:22:25.920 --> 4:22:28.720]  yeah and and that ended up making me a little bit stronger but it would have
[4:22:28.720 --> 4:22:31.520]  been great if somebody would have put me in something like jiu-jitsu way back
[4:22:31.520 --> 4:22:34.160]  then yeah because i wouldn't have learned how to just have knocked down drag
[4:22:34.160 --> 4:22:36.800]  out some people you could still enjoy it now you know it's a great
[4:22:36.800 --> 4:22:39.360]  how old are you now 35 35 look you still got
[4:22:39.360 --> 4:22:42.320]  time man you could you can train you could learn you can get good at it and
[4:22:42.320 --> 4:22:45.680]  so it's a fun thing to do for exercise because you know getting to the gym
[4:22:45.680 --> 4:22:48.800]  just get on the elliptical machine and lift and weights it can get pretty
[4:22:48.800 --> 4:22:52.640]  tedious no it doesn't but jiu-jitsu is like always fun to do you know you're

[4:24:32.960 --> 4:24:36.080]  to hit iran in two years unless you do what they're told by the globalists
[4:24:36.080 --> 4:24:39.440]  they're not building nukes the russians have built it it's it's it's it's it's
[4:24:39.440 --> 4:24:43.200]  non-weapon the u.s gave pakistan nukes to menace
[4:24:43.200 --> 4:24:49.120]  india and pakistan really and and china uh so it's all a global geopolitical
[4:24:49.120 --> 4:24:52.560]  chess game that it's the school of sabignin brzezinski he's kind of the
[4:24:52.560 --> 4:24:57.680]  eddy bravo of geopolitics and uh what is going on with north korea
[4:24:57.680 --> 4:25:00.640]  it's like a chess game with like 50 levels and they're all just
[4:25:00.640 --> 4:25:04.320]  north korea was given the nukes by rumsfeld it's as the head of abb
[4:25:04.320 --> 4:25:07.920]  in 1996 so they could destabilize that and have a reason to attack them and
[4:25:07.920 --> 4:25:11.440]  of course the dictators are always like yes give me but it's like in the old
[4:25:11.440 --> 4:25:15.040]  western of bill hicks line right where the guy throws that movie
[4:25:15.040 --> 4:25:18.480]  the the the movie that he talked about it's in a bunch of movies where is that
[4:25:18.480 --> 4:25:22.000]  it i don't know but i've seen it like in other movies uh you see it in that one
[4:25:22.000 --> 4:25:25.600]  clean eastwood which is based on true story jack palance right does the the
[4:25:25.600 --> 4:25:29.200]  pick up the gun kid yeah where they throw the gun down to get him to pick it up
[4:25:29.200 --> 4:25:31.600]  yeah but there's also that clean eastwood movie where he goes to the mining
[4:25:31.600 --> 4:25:35.680]  town and they kill the guy's dad and then they throw the gun down in front of
[4:25:35.680 --> 4:25:37.760]  the kid and see it up i mean that's actually
[4:25:37.760 --> 4:25:40.640]  happening in some real western stories is what you see in so many movies
[4:25:40.640 --> 4:25:42.640]  but that's it they're just giving him a gun
[4:25:42.640 --> 4:25:49.040]  right crazy tell me about cap city comedy club it's a fun place
[4:25:49.040 --> 4:25:54.320]  i filmed my very first dvd there back in 1999 the one that you uh you uh and me
[4:25:54.320 --> 4:25:57.920]  wore the george bush mask and danced around the capital remember that people
[4:25:57.920 --> 4:26:02.080]  are so silly though they think that's footage of a secret satanic ritual
[4:26:02.080 --> 4:26:06.480]  we had feather bow is on i had a feather bow we're out there at the capital
[4:26:06.480 --> 4:26:09.600]  we're running around acting like we're the devil and bush and then they think
[4:26:09.600 --> 4:26:13.600]  we're serious hey finishing up how crazy is it that there's all these websites
[4:26:13.600 --> 4:26:16.960]  that really believe on bill hicks that's an amazing they're doing voice analysis
[4:26:16.960 --> 4:26:19.680]  and everything else uh well you know that just goes to show you people will
[4:26:19.680 --> 4:26:22.960]  believe almost anything you know it's there's a lot of dopes out there
[4:26:22.960 --> 4:26:25.600]  that's why you know they don't want people organ like we were talking about
[4:26:25.600 --> 4:26:28.560]  wakeover earlier the reason why they don't want that is not just that they
[4:26:28.560 --> 4:26:31.040]  don't want people to be able to protect themselves from the government
[4:26:31.040 --> 4:26:34.480]  there's probably a little bit of that but there's also they don't want warlords
[4:26:34.480 --> 4:26:37.520]  they don't want people to do like what's going on in afghanistan to be able to
[4:26:37.520 --> 4:26:41.120]  start their own cults and arm everybody and control these groups of people
[4:26:41.120 --> 4:26:45.280]  because it's not hard to control people we have a a defect in our operating
[4:26:45.280 --> 4:26:49.120]  system and you can exploit that defect with confidence
[4:26:49.120 --> 4:26:54.800]  and with with you know a clear you know a clear doctrine of what's supposed to
[4:26:54.800 --> 4:26:57.360]  go down and what's supposed to happen you could say that you're getting this
[4:26:57.360 --> 4:27:01.440]  information from aliens or higher power or what joseph smith said you know you
[4:27:01.440 --> 4:27:04.960]  got it from golden tablets that had the lost work at jesus on it it's not hard
[4:27:04.960 --> 4:27:08.560]  to do and you could you could start your own group well that's because we're
[4:27:08.560 --> 4:27:12.640]  very similar to dogs that's why dogs live with us yes they follow the alpha
[4:27:12.640 --> 4:27:15.920]  yeah exactly and they follow confidence and leadership
[4:27:15.920 --> 4:27:19.040]  and but but again the biggest cult is the globalist and they happen to be a
[4:27:19.040 --> 4:27:23.600]  eugenics death cult so what i'm saying is i'd rather have a few jim jones's
[4:27:23.600 --> 4:27:27.360]  or people around know about that then the then the then that well also he was
[4:27:27.360 --> 4:27:30.560]  tied into cia but the point is this got to be a middle ground
[4:27:30.560 --> 4:27:33.360]  there's got to be you know let people have their guns to defend themselves
[4:27:33.360 --> 4:27:36.960]  that's what's so good about ron paul he is not a cult leader yes he is a doctor
[4:27:36.960 --> 4:27:40.400]  he's a mainline guy and we need to follow him instead of the cult of
[4:27:40.400 --> 4:27:43.840]  republicans and democrats i agree a hundred percent and when he talks about
[4:27:43.840 --> 4:27:47.200]  these vaccinations he says it's absolutely ridiculous and he talks
[4:27:47.200 --> 4:27:50.960]  about how the regular flu is so much more deadly and killed so many more
[4:27:50.960 --> 4:27:53.440]  people per year you know than this swine flu and
[4:27:53.440 --> 4:27:56.400]  everybody's jumping all over this and this they're making a big deal out of
[4:27:56.400 --> 4:27:58.880]  it well then and again it's common sense that this is
[4:27:58.880 --> 4:28:02.480]  killing about one-fifth in the flu season with the regular flu does which
[4:28:02.480 --> 4:28:05.360]  money do they make from they've made seven billion
[4:28:05.360 --> 4:28:08.560]  a week ago the boston globe reported that the last week and a half
[4:28:08.560 --> 4:28:11.600]  five drug makers had made seven billion extra in a week and a half
[4:28:11.600 --> 4:28:16.000]  god damn all from vaccinations seven billion extra
[4:28:16.000 --> 4:28:22.000]  that is incredible that's incredible and does this get reported in mainstream
[4:28:22.000 --> 4:28:24.320]  news is anybody look at it as a possible angle
[4:28:24.320 --> 4:28:28.160]  a lot of people are pointing out it is starting to come out in in mass media
