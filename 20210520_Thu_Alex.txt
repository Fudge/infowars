[00:00.000 --> 00:17.840]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop
[00:17.840 --> 00:35.560]  tyranny will so does he live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones and
[00:35.560 --> 00:38.880]  we'll be hearing from Alice today but Owen Troyer sitting in Alex on a working
[00:38.880 --> 00:48.200]  vacation but first the latest bombshell explosive report from Greg Reese up
[00:48.200 --> 00:55.680]  until recently the CIA's long close relationship with the late Jim Jones has
[00:55.680 --> 01:00.880]  always been a mystery from the very beginning of his ministry Dan
[01:00.880 --> 01:06.520]  Mitrione was always close in the shadows Mitrione was an expert in
[01:06.520 --> 01:12.280]  torture encounter insurgency techniques for the CIA who taught many of the same
[01:12.280 --> 01:20.480]  methods used by Jim Jones in 1978 one year after the CIA's MK ultra was exposed
[01:20.480 --> 01:26.360]  to the public nearly a thousand people died in Jonestown the chief medical
[01:26.360 --> 01:32.640]  examiner reported that nearly 90 percent were homicides and yet the American
[01:32.640 --> 01:38.760]  media called it a mass suicide Jonestown became known as the place where
[01:38.760 --> 01:46.280]  hundreds of people drank the Kool-Aid Jonestown seems to be a CIA beta test
[01:46.280 --> 01:53.400]  for the COVID vaccine agenda being rolled out today Jim Jones applied many
[01:53.400 --> 02:00.040]  known mind control techniques separating people from their families creating a
[02:00.040 --> 02:06.080]  lingo to distort the truth demonized the questioning of authority but what
[02:06.080 --> 02:10.400]  really stood out was his constant warnings that the government was going
[02:10.400 --> 02:15.360]  to try and kill them all he said that he would not let them he had his
[02:15.360 --> 02:21.320]  followers practice suicide drills and called it revolutionary suicide willing
[02:21.320 --> 02:30.040]  to die tonight for revolutionary suicide thank you the main ideology of Jonestown
[02:30.040 --> 02:37.200]  was that America is a racist nation and capitalism is evil and they sought to
[02:37.200 --> 02:44.440]  create a utopia of equality and fairness we know all about this ideology in
[02:44.440 --> 02:51.640]  2021 the slow destruction of the family unit can be traced back a century to
[02:51.640 --> 02:59.360]  planned parenthood to the 1964 war on poverty to gay marriage all the way to
[02:59.360 --> 03:05.320]  our current trend of transsexual child abuse this has created generations of
[03:05.320 --> 03:12.440]  lost souls ripe to be exploited by the charlatans and sociopaths who wield the
[03:12.440 --> 03:18.320]  power of pop culture and mainstream media the Colts is given their own lingo
[03:18.320 --> 03:26.120]  to distort the truth they are woke and to be woke requires absolute conformity
[03:26.120 --> 03:32.280]  if you question the authority you are silenced you are labeled a racist without
[03:32.280 --> 03:37.920]  any evidence or a science denier without any scientific explanation
[03:37.920 --> 03:44.520]  whatsoever and above all you are taught that human civilization is killing the
[03:44.520 --> 03:50.480]  planet you are taught that the only way to save the earth is to depopulate you
[03:50.480 --> 03:57.800]  are taught that humanity is a virus human beings are disease a cancer of this
[03:57.800 --> 04:05.560]  planet and so when Bill Gates the front man pushing this narrative for the past
[04:05.560 --> 04:11.120]  decade steps out and offers the final solution and then the final solution
[04:11.120 --> 04:17.640]  which is a year to two years off is the vaccine it's no surprise to see the cult
[04:17.640 --> 04:23.680]  lining up to get their shot the crimes against humanity we are witnessing are

[06:20.080 --> 06:46.720]  your host Owen Troyer ladies and gentlemen it is Thursday May 20th
[06:46.720 --> 06:51.840]  2021 this is a live Alex Jones transmission we'll be hearing from Alex
[06:51.840 --> 07:01.880]  before the end of the broadcast and yet again info wars in triplicate is proven
[07:01.880 --> 07:18.200]  to be next year's news today it is now being admitted by the Biden CDC
[07:18.200 --> 07:32.080]  director that it is possible that COVID-19 originated out of a lab in Wuhan China
[07:32.080 --> 07:45.160]  now where oh where oh where oh where oh where did you first hear that okay we all
[07:45.160 --> 07:49.600]  know where we first heard that right here on the Alex Jones show over a year
[07:49.600 --> 07:56.560]  ago with dr. Francis Boyle and of course as usual they like to attack us and
[07:56.560 --> 08:02.920]  ridicule us and call us conspiracy theorists and everything else but you
[08:02.920 --> 08:09.760]  already knew that didn't you how is it that you in this audience are smarter
[08:09.760 --> 08:22.480]  and more akin to information than Joe Biden CDC director Rochelle Wolinski who
[08:22.480 --> 08:33.080]  now admits that it is possible COVID-19 leaked out of a Wuhan lab but the story
[08:33.080 --> 08:37.560]  doesn't stop there ladies and gentlemen know the story doesn't stop there at
[08:37.560 --> 08:45.280]  all house Intel Republicans not only want further investigation into the Wuhan
[08:45.280 --> 08:52.360]  lab further investigation into Fauci's involvement in the Wuhan lab they want
[08:52.360 --> 08:56.840]  to know what involvement the Chinese military had with that Wuhan lab which
[08:56.840 --> 09:02.760]  of course we know they have been quick to erase off their website in the last
[09:02.760 --> 09:11.000]  month the Chinese military members involved in that Wuhan lab and now even
[09:11.000 --> 09:17.480]  the liberal think-take projection machine wing of the Democrat Party
[09:17.480 --> 09:25.040]  politifact admits that COVID-19 from a Wuhan lab is not a conspiracy theory
[09:25.040 --> 09:36.960]  whoa my how the mighty have fallen with their false narrative about COVID-19
[09:36.960 --> 09:46.160]  from a wet lab and a bat when all evidence now points to a Wuhan lab but
[09:46.160 --> 09:52.880]  there's more ripples now that we see there was a Chinese military involvement
[09:52.880 --> 09:58.120]  now that you see Chinese professors going on television saying yep COVID-19
[09:58.120 --> 10:02.600]  was a bio weapon released by China and it's gonna be used to help us conquer
[10:02.600 --> 10:11.200]  the world and defeat the United States of America oh and so a new story at
[10:11.200 --> 10:16.560]  Gateway Pundit new revelations from inside China indicate actual location of
[10:16.560 --> 10:22.560]  its military origin of COVID-19 so was there a different release remember
[10:22.560 --> 10:26.440]  there were the world military games at the time as well hell they could have
[10:26.440 --> 10:34.600]  just released an event 201 just really made it a perfect circle and then of
[10:34.600 --> 10:44.360]  course the alley-oop to the eugenics of the experimental gene modification jab
[10:44.360 --> 10:49.440]  known as the COVID vaccine you have more negative side effects of that and the
[10:49.440 --> 10:56.680]  incredible thing is and we took calls on this all yesterday but whether it's
[10:56.680 --> 11:01.680]  people in the military or people working at companies that are forcing them to
[11:01.680 --> 11:06.440]  take the vaccine they're seeing all the negative side effects it's making the
[11:06.440 --> 11:11.280]  local news these reports are penetrating through mainstream news it's making
[11:11.280 --> 11:18.600]  local papers it's all over the internet and so members of the military are
[11:18.600 --> 11:22.800]  rejecting it people that whose employers are forcing them to take it are
[11:22.800 --> 11:28.320]  rejecting it and then how are you gonna force people to do this for a virus that
[11:28.320 --> 11:35.160]  they're no longer afraid of and for a vaccine that has all these negative side
[11:35.160 --> 11:41.040]  effects that are actually being I mean I wouldn't say well-covered but they are
[11:41.040 --> 11:47.120]  being covered it's getting into local news it's getting into people's living
[11:47.120 --> 11:56.360]  rooms and so that is such a key element that is such a key factor in all of this
[11:56.360 --> 12:03.000]  like there's this huffing and puffing about why is it news that Demi Lovato is
[12:03.000 --> 12:07.080]  non-binary why does anybody care well it's not news nobody cares it's all
[12:07.080 --> 12:12.400]  about getting it into your living room it's not about it being news it's about
[12:12.400 --> 12:15.760]  it being propaganda getting it into your living room getting it into your
[12:15.760 --> 12:21.720]  consciousness introducing it to your children as part of a propaganda campaign
[12:21.720 --> 12:26.880]  to maybe hey push your kid into being gay or push your kid into being trans or
[12:26.880 --> 12:31.040]  push your kid into wanting to have their genitals chopped off or non-binary or
[12:31.040 --> 12:34.920]  explore their sexuality or their gender something completely irrelevant it's a
[12:34.920 --> 12:39.680]  mental it's a mental case it's a mental disorder pushing your kids into mental
[12:39.680 --> 12:55.000]  disorder but that is such that element of it's why they censor info wars it's why
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.800]  they only want their controlled opposition on the cable news channels
[13:00.800 --> 13:04.160]  that's why they only want their controlled opposition on the late-night talk
[13:04.160 --> 13:09.880]  shows they want to be control in control of what goes into your house what goes
[13:09.880 --> 13:16.120]  into your consciousness so they don't want the energy they don't want the
[13:16.120 --> 13:21.040]  freedoms they don't want the the attitude they don't want the resistance
[13:21.040 --> 13:25.480]  they don't want info wars getting into your consciousness getting into your
[13:25.480 --> 13:34.640]  living room they want Demi Lovato's non-binary you know gay lesbian Homo gender
[13:34.640 --> 13:40.200]  queer whatever that's what they want in your living room not hey freedom is
[13:40.200 --> 13:47.800]  good the free market works or COVID-19 came out of a lab or the vaccines are
[13:47.800 --> 13:58.240]  killing people they want Demi Lovato's a non-binary queer gender fairy but they
[13:58.240 --> 14:06.440]  can't how does Bob Marley say it is that you can trick some of the people some of
[14:06.440 --> 14:10.400]  the time you can't trick all the people all the time so there's still good
[14:10.400 --> 14:16.320]  people out there in local media that think it's concerning that the COVID
[14:16.320 --> 14:20.240]  vaccine is killing people think it's concerning all these weird side effects
[14:20.240 --> 14:23.240]  they're seeing around them and then they go out and they reach out to one of
[14:23.240 --> 14:26.800]  them they do a local news story on it and then other people see it and then
[14:26.800 --> 14:30.120]  they think huh maybe I don't want this COVID jab people in the military see it
[14:30.120 --> 14:34.520]  they go this is dangerous I don't think I want this oh and that upsets Bill Gates
[14:34.520 --> 14:45.040]  that upsets Anthony Fauci that upsets the Democrats that upsets the cult so
[14:45.040 --> 14:51.040]  that's one news story today and you know this this I don't even know how to
[14:51.040 --> 14:57.960]  properly cover this it's so ridiculous it's just another level of the Democrat
[14:57.960 --> 15:02.560]  Party going full tyranny full authoritarianism full totalitarianism and
[15:02.560 --> 15:09.080]  they now completely run the FBI the FBI is just a wing of the Democrat Party the
[15:09.080 --> 15:13.120]  CIA is just a wing of the Democrat Party and that's because the Democrat Party
[15:13.120 --> 15:21.080]  at large has fully sold America out to globalism fully sold America out and and
[15:21.080 --> 15:24.960]  and are now riding along for and cheering on the destruction of the United
[15:24.960 --> 15:29.160]  States of America that so that's where the Democrat Party's at now so yeah so
[15:29.160 --> 15:33.000]  it's not even at the FBI is a wing of the Democrat Party or the CIA is a wing of
[15:33.000 --> 15:36.240]  the Democrat Party really it's the Democrat Party has become a wing of the
[15:36.240 --> 15:40.280]  New World Order the Democrat Party has become the wing of the Communist World
[15:40.280 --> 15:45.480]  Takeover the Democrat Party is now part of the world criminal cabal deep state
[15:45.480 --> 15:50.600]  shadow government which the FBI the CIA and everything else was already a part
[15:50.600 --> 15:54.120]  of so it's not that it's not that they're part of the Democrat Party it's
[15:54.120 --> 15:58.560]  Democrat Party is now part of the New World Order Takeover America
[15:59.080 --> 16:04.040]  one of the most popular memes on the internet the last decade has been Alex
[16:04.040 --> 16:09.560]  Jones was right but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like
[16:09.560 --> 16:13.360]  Twitter and Facebook making the globalists pull their hair out in
[16:13.360 --> 16:16.680]  anger but let me tell you we are tomorrow's news today and thanks for
[16:16.680 --> 16:20.440]  your support we're still on air at info wars.com and band on video radio
[16:20.440 --> 16:23.720]  stations and TV stations across the country and our film in game censored and
[16:23.720 --> 16:27.560]  taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years ago it's now
[16:27.560 --> 16:32.000]  available again we have reprinted it high quality DVD in HD it has a zero
[16:32.000 --> 16:35.400]  country code any one in the world is authorized to make copies of it and I'm
[16:35.400 --> 16:38.360]  asking you to get the original make copies give it to everyone you know
[16:38.360 --> 16:42.600]  Errol Glasses TV give it to your pastors your police chiefs your state reps your
[16:42.600 --> 16:45.600]  prime ministers whatever you do warn the world this film uses their own
[16:45.600 --> 16:50.120]  documents and statements 14 years ago to expose them it's more important than
[16:50.120 --> 16:55.120]  ever available at infowarstore.com that's infowarstore.com in game blueprint for
[16:55.120 --> 16:57.640]  global enslavement
[16:58.240 --> 17:02.760]  one of the most common questions I get on air but also off air when I'm just
[17:02.760 --> 17:08.520]  out and about is Alex what do I say to my family about the vaccines how do I
[17:08.520 --> 17:13.440]  warn them well the problem is there's so many problems with it so many facts it's
[17:13.440 --> 17:16.480]  the history of contaminated vaccines the fact that they have liability
[17:16.480 --> 17:20.400]  protection in the US and Europe the fact that they've been caught adding
[17:20.400 --> 17:24.120]  sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines and the whole
[17:24.120 --> 17:28.680]  history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks poor whites
[17:28.680 --> 17:33.360]  Native Americans the list goes on and on but what about the fact that Fauci
[17:33.360 --> 17:39.360]  testified to Congress and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021 that
[17:39.360 --> 17:45.040]  around half of the NIH CDC staff medical doctors or all of the scientists have
[17:45.040 --> 17:48.480]  refused to take the vaccine until they can say yeah I think what half of the
[17:48.480 --> 17:52.200]  doctors are scared to take it that's the same thing in the private practices
[17:52.200 --> 17:54.920]  out there somewhere numbers that that's not something I'm gonna be taking that's
[17:54.920 --> 18:05.920]  very very simple there's your answer you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[18:25.920 --> 18:35.280]  so if you are a listener to info wars you knew this over a year ago what I
[18:35.280 --> 18:42.080]  guess Biden CDC is just figuring out now so either they're just a year and a
[18:42.080 --> 18:49.240]  half behind us intellectually or they were lying and covering it up and not
[18:49.240 --> 18:55.240]  being honest about the situation either way it's not good but we have the clip
[18:55.240 --> 19:02.240]  let me go through these headlines so we're gonna play Rochelle Walensky here
[19:02.240 --> 19:06.440]  in a second Biden CDC director says lab origin of COVID-19 a possibility oh a
[19:06.440 --> 19:14.720]  possibility now yeah oh possibility she says what's next oh it's a certainty I
[19:14.720 --> 19:17.680]  mean how long till it's a guaranteed certainty of course we don't we can't
[19:17.680 --> 19:20.400]  get a fair investigation and they've had enough time to cover all their tracks
[19:20.400 --> 19:26.520]  now so even if you had a fair investigation at this point it'd be
[19:26.520 --> 19:29.960]  like you know the Maricopa County vote audit where they just erased the data
[19:29.960 --> 19:35.640]  you know something like that but before we go to that clip here's some of the
[19:35.640 --> 19:41.200]  other headlines around this house until Republicans under the leadership of Dr.
[19:41.200 --> 19:46.120]  Anthony Fauci the United States likely engaged in dangerous research in China
[19:46.120 --> 19:51.240]  COVID-19 escaped Wuhan lab but I think it's actually worse than that quite
[19:51.240 --> 19:59.000]  frankly now you have to decide what you're gonna take a face value and what
[19:59.000 --> 20:04.880]  what could potentially be intentional propaganda is China covering up the
[20:04.880 --> 20:08.640]  military involvement in the Wuhan lab is Chinese professors coming out saying
[20:08.640 --> 20:11.320]  this is a bio weapon to conquer the world and defeat the United States of
[20:11.320 --> 20:16.640]  America are they being honest about this is this all kind of just muddying the
[20:16.640 --> 20:25.480]  water even more I don't know that that's a serious debate but that's what's
[20:25.480 --> 20:28.960]  happening in China that they're covering up the military involvement in that
[20:28.960 --> 20:33.160]  Wuhan lab and then professors coming out saying this was a bio weapon to conquer
[20:33.160 --> 20:36.800]  the world and defeat the United States of America and we know they were working
[20:36.800 --> 20:40.960]  on this exact virus out of that Wuhan lab and we know it was the gain of
[20:40.960 --> 20:46.040]  function research given to them by Fauci and Obama that they expanded on that
[20:46.040 --> 20:50.400]  ultimately led to the COVID-19 release Rand Paul knows it members of the House
[20:50.400 --> 20:55.560]  Intel Committee know it maybe everybody knows it they're just not being honest
[20:55.560 --> 20:59.280]  about it yet they're just not telling you about it yet because they like Dr.
[20:59.280 --> 21:03.400]  Fauci and they like their false narrative about COVID-19 and they like it
[21:03.400 --> 21:10.320]  being used to conquer the world and defeat America but no I think it's
[21:10.320 --> 21:16.600]  worse if it if it were I mean I don't know what would you consider a worst
[21:16.600 --> 21:24.840]  case scenario but I mean you could have a scenario where this was indeed
[21:24.840 --> 21:32.040]  intentionally released by the Chinese military a bio weapon and that bio weapon
[21:32.040 --> 21:41.720]  essentially was given to them by Obama and Fauci pretty big story there is it
[21:41.720 --> 21:47.760]  not bigger than Obama with the gun running in Operation Fast and Furious
[21:47.760 --> 21:54.200]  bigger than the cover-up of the the terrorist attack in Benghazi that killed
[21:54.200 --> 21:56.800]  Americans that Hillary Clinton and others stood down on because they wanted
[21:56.800 --> 22:02.520]  them dead bigger than the illegal spying done by Barack Obama and the line to
[22:02.520 --> 22:06.720]  the FISA court and all of that against Donald Trump and others bigger than all
[22:06.720 --> 22:13.800]  of that combined bigger than the cash to Iran that they then used now they
[22:13.800 --> 22:22.360]  admit sending drones into Israel giving weapons to Hamas you also had a ship of
[22:22.360 --> 22:30.080]  weapons get caught out of Iran heading down to Yemen the Democratic Party
[22:30.080 --> 22:36.240]  funding Iran funding the exterminate the Jews movement but this is bigger than
[22:36.240 --> 22:42.840]  all of that is it not Barack Obama and Anthony Fauci provide China with the
[22:42.840 --> 22:50.760]  resources provide China with the research provide China with the bio weapon
[22:50.760 --> 23:00.400]  that they then released to the world hmm and see you have the sycophant media and
[23:00.400 --> 23:05.560]  you know I'm wondering if there's another level to these liberals on TV's
[23:05.560 --> 23:13.440]  mentality and psychosis that they're in such an arrested development phase and
[23:13.440 --> 23:17.560]  it's beyond pride it's one thing it you know swallow your pride admit you were
[23:17.560 --> 23:23.800]  wrong it for them it's like beyond pride they made Barack Obama into an idol
[23:23.800 --> 23:29.440]  into a demagogue I mean they worshiped the guy and and they're kind of seeing
[23:29.440 --> 23:33.520]  the same stuff with Biden you can search like Biden triumphs or you know
[23:33.520 --> 23:37.120]  Biden majesty and you literally find all American media praising it like it's
[23:37.120 --> 23:42.680]  North Korea or something so they've created this new sycophantic obsession
[23:42.680 --> 23:47.960]  with their political leaders and so they can't be honest about who they are
[23:47.960 --> 23:50.600]  they can't be honest about their corruption they can't be honest about
[23:50.600 --> 23:54.560]  how evil they are because that reflects on them that like that makes them look
[23:54.560 --> 23:57.440]  stupid that makes them look like dupes or that makes them look like they're a
[23:57.440 --> 24:01.080]  part of it and they have too much pride or they don't want that to come out
[24:01.080 --> 24:06.800]  either so they'll cover up for Obama and you know notice how Obama this guy is
[24:06.800 --> 24:13.640]  such a narcissistic he is so obsessed with himself he probably looks at
[24:13.640 --> 24:19.800]  himself in the mirror more than the average teenage girl and he just had to
[24:19.800 --> 24:23.320]  get his name back in the headline so he's out commenting on aliens and UFOs
[24:23.320 --> 24:27.800]  now no it has nothing to do with whatever operation is being run with the
[24:27.800 --> 24:32.160]  declassification of the UFOs no bomb has nothing to do with it no it's not part
[24:32.160 --> 24:37.320]  of some campaign he's just a selfish narcissistic jerk who wanted his name
[24:37.320 --> 24:42.480]  back in the headlines and for that and not forgiving the bio-weapon to China
[24:42.480 --> 24:44.960]  that they then released on the world potentially
[24:44.960 --> 24:50.360]  political facts quietly admits COVID-19 19 lab escaped not a debunked
[24:50.360 --> 24:54.680]  conspiracy theory oh wow and then the latest from the Gateway Punnett we know
[24:54.680 --> 24:59.040]  COVID-19 was created in a lab but new revelations from inside China indicate
[24:59.040 --> 25:03.600]  actual location of its military origin released as a military weapon here is
[25:03.600 --> 25:11.080]  the Biden CDC director Rachelle Wolinski admitting what Info Wars reported over a
[25:11.080 --> 25:19.840]  year ago is the real case the real story about COVID what in your opinion was the
[25:19.840 --> 25:27.360]  origin of the virus this has been studied by the WHO my mask in your
[25:27.360 --> 25:33.320]  pocket pause it I don't believe I started back at her response immediately she
[25:33.320 --> 25:38.080]  touts the World Health Organization funded by Bill Gates funded by China and
[25:38.080 --> 25:47.240]  and has a direct reason to cover up the true origins of the COVID-19 virus I
[25:47.240 --> 25:50.040]  mean just just unbelievable so just shows you how controlled she is how
[25:50.040 --> 25:54.840]  totally bought into the system she is all right all right go back the origin of
[25:54.840 --> 26:03.440]  the virus this has been studied by the WHO my mask in your opinion I don't
[26:03.440 --> 26:08.040]  believe I've seen enough data individual data for me to be able to comment on that
[26:08.040 --> 26:13.400]  what are the possibilities certainly the possibilities that most coronavirus is
[26:13.400 --> 26:18.600]  that we know of are of origin from that have infected the population SARS-CoV-1
[26:18.600 --> 26:25.400]  MERS generally come from an animal origin and other any other possibilities
[26:25.400 --> 26:32.360]  certainly a lab-based origin as one possibility okay oh they know it they
[26:32.360 --> 26:39.560]  all know it I'll tell you what though some people I mean even that right there
[26:39.560 --> 26:44.800]  that's that's her kind of even hedging her bet like oh so everybody here knows
[26:44.800 --> 26:49.520]  it came out of a lab huh oh well I don't want to be a part of the cover-up so
[26:49.520 --> 26:53.960]  yeah maybe it came out of lab that's folks I'm telling you this this whole
[26:53.960 --> 26:57.760]  thing is falling apart but that just makes it more dangerous all of the

[32:06.320 --> 32:11.720]  Alex Jones show today but folks remember support info wars financially to keep us
[32:11.720 --> 32:21.400]  on air it is a necessity alright so I just had Gregory's coming here hey have
[32:21.400 --> 32:25.720]  you seen this video and I had it on my list and so I'm going to play it right
[32:25.720 --> 32:31.480]  now a little girl who appears to love and understand America better than the
[32:31.480 --> 32:36.280]  average liberal that has a phd from Harvard these days this girl is only I
[32:36.280 --> 32:39.800]  think five years old and then I was just talking to some of the crew in the
[32:39.800 --> 32:46.680]  break about how there's this you know they're gonna meet music festivals and
[32:46.680 --> 32:49.480]  all these things are gonna make you take a vaccine before you can go into them
[32:49.480 --> 32:53.680]  now and it looks like that's what the route the music entertainment industry
[32:53.680 --> 32:57.200]  is taking it looks like the sports entertainment industry may be not going
[32:57.200 --> 33:01.760]  that direction with full crowds now no masks no vaccine passports but it looks
[33:01.760 --> 33:05.680]  like that's where the music industry is going and I was explaining how there's
[33:05.680 --> 33:12.320]  this event in Austin three night event it's an outdoor music event and it's
[33:12.320 --> 33:20.480]  masks required and vaccine proof of vaccine required too and so he says you
[33:20.480 --> 33:24.320]  know the important thing to do here is to get this message to the youth and
[33:24.320 --> 33:29.200]  and that's really what hit me because this music festival thing is gonna be a
[33:29.200 --> 33:33.640]  bunch of young people it's gonna be probably a bunch of you know teenagers
[33:33.640 --> 33:39.480]  college kids and so they're being indoctrinated into this and then when it
[33:39.480 --> 33:42.280]  happens to their children and their grandchildren they're not gonna stand up
[33:42.280 --> 33:48.480]  and fight it because it's the world that they knew and there wasn't enough rise
[33:48.480 --> 33:52.840]  and resistance against it at this time so they just accept it and just move on
[33:52.840 --> 33:58.640]  and the next generation of Americans becomes more enslaved so it really is
[33:58.640 --> 34:04.520]  about somehow stopping this brainwashing and indoctrination of the youth to
[34:04.520 --> 34:12.120]  believe everything's racist I've got this new video from PBS I mean I had look
[34:12.120 --> 34:15.720]  I have nothing against men that want to dress like women I have nothing against
[34:15.720 --> 34:19.440]  people that want to change their sex or do whatever they do in their private
[34:19.440 --> 34:24.280]  time it doesn't matter to me I don't care I'm not affected by it but the
[34:24.280 --> 34:33.840]  children are and so this is a PBS video of Little Miss Hot Mess teaching kids
[34:33.840 --> 34:43.080]  about drag queens and and transsexualism and this is from PBS PBS your tax
[34:43.080 --> 34:51.960]  dollars for children aged three to eight to learn from Little Miss Hot Mess how
[34:51.960 --> 34:58.160]  to be a drag queen how to be transsexual how to be transgender and see they
[34:58.160 --> 35:04.160]  look they lump it in with all their other youth videos that they're fine enough
[35:04.160 --> 35:08.200]  teaching kids how to read and write and math and stuff hey fine PBS good for you
[35:08.200 --> 35:12.840]  you know what that's alright but oh you just had to put Little Miss Hot Mess in
[35:12.840 --> 35:17.600]  there didn't you dressed like a drag queen teaching your kids about tranny
[35:17.600 --> 35:23.520]  time teaching their teaching your kids how to shake their butt for it for a for
[35:23.520 --> 35:33.240]  a drag queen with a skull and crossbones tattooed on her arm in the book for kids
[35:33.240 --> 35:37.920]  three to eight so it's like hey we're PBS we have a new online learning course
[35:37.920 --> 35:41.680]  teach your kids how to read and write and math and oh by the way the first thing
[35:41.680 --> 35:44.880]  you see when you watch this video is Little Miss Hot Mess teaching your kids
[35:44.880 --> 35:52.200]  how to shake their butts for tranny time there it is and you've got the little
[35:52.200 --> 35:55.560]  death with the hearts on it because you know they love death it's all about
[35:55.560 --> 36:01.880]  killing your kid I guess they're dead inside again I don't care if men want
[36:01.880 --> 36:05.540]  to dress up like women and play with one another's whatever's some of my
[36:05.540 --> 36:10.040]  business what you do but why are you bringing the kids into it well that's
[36:10.040 --> 36:14.000]  why because they want to indoctrinate the kids so then they get used to it
[36:14.000 --> 36:17.480]  just like these young kids get used to being forced to wear a mask forced to
[36:17.480 --> 36:20.960]  take a vaccine forced to show their vaccine passport and then they don't
[36:20.960 --> 36:23.880]  fight against it when their kids are subjected to it and then it's worse for
[36:23.880 --> 36:27.120]  their grandkids and they don't fight against it because you just get slowly
[36:27.120 --> 36:35.400]  boiled like the frog in in in the pot death with a thousand cuts but here's a
[36:35.400 --> 36:38.920]  young girl that gives you hope here's a young girl that gets it here's a young
[36:38.920 --> 36:44.360]  girl who understands American values better than the average liberal
[36:44.360 --> 36:49.520]  Democrat with three PhDs and a television show a young girl explains
[36:49.520 --> 36:53.080]  freedom and liberty to her school administration along with her classmates
[36:53.080 --> 36:57.760]  I'm not sure where this is but but here is this young girl that is so
[36:57.760 --> 37:04.040]  inspirational and I don't think barely anybody likes masks in school their
[37:04.040 --> 37:10.400]  children are suffocating you don't know what it feels like and it's not a sense
[37:10.400 --> 37:16.400]  seriously like why would you do that why in the world would you do that and
[37:16.400 --> 37:23.200]  to God it created us so we can be free people and we're not being free here all
[37:23.200 --> 37:30.920]  that public schools okay so I would take a mask off if I were you and and I'm not
[37:30.920 --> 37:37.760]  wearing a mask right now and I never will as much as I can and in George
[37:37.760 --> 37:43.560]  Washington made America so we could be free citizens of the United States of
[37:43.560 --> 37:50.040]  America and the Statue of Liberty is for liberty and freedom and we're not free so
[37:50.040 --> 37:54.600]  maybe you just don't believe in George Washington all God all like the boss
[37:54.600 --> 38:01.200]  of you or someone is controlling you Wow so just a small snippet looks like I
[38:01.200 --> 38:04.520]  get caught up there at the end so there's probably even more of that
[38:04.520 --> 38:09.240]  amazing video and that's just like the other young boy we saw to stand up and
[38:09.240 --> 38:16.080]  give a similar speech in front of his school board incredible she should host
[38:16.080 --> 38:21.480]  a TV show she's better than Rachel Russia Moscow Rachel Russia Rach mad cow
[38:21.480 --> 38:26.400]  who's losing her mind by the way and this woman is not saying now let's look
[38:26.400 --> 38:31.200]  at the other side of the spectrum in clip 14 so yeah young kids don't like
[38:31.200 --> 38:34.600]  wearing the masks they like breathing free air and I guess they have more of an
[38:34.600 --> 38:40.280]  instinct to be free than many adults these days and so a bus driver decided
[38:40.280 --> 38:44.440]  to intervene because some kids weren't wearing a mask I'm not sure if there's
[38:44.440 --> 38:50.080]  audio here guys rule clip 3 for me the moment a call out a bus driver slapped
[38:50.080 --> 38:54.640]  a 10-year-old girl allegedly over a face mask we want to warn you that you
[38:54.640 --> 38:58.680]  might find some of this video disturbing this oh yeah early April a liberal
[38:58.680 --> 39:03.360]  abusing a child on County and is for to protect the identity of the students but
[39:03.360 --> 39:08.440]  video from KK TV shows the bus driver talking to the girl after she says she
[39:08.440 --> 39:12.880]  moved her mask below her nose because she wasn't feeling well that driver whose
[39:12.880 --> 39:19.440]  name is Bertram walkies then flaps the child he's not facing charges including
[39:19.440 --> 39:25.120]  harassment assault causing injury and child abuse yeah show me you're a
[39:25.120 --> 39:29.640]  liberal without telling me show me you hate Trump without telling me show me
[39:29.640 --> 39:34.560]  you voted by to without telling me slapping a young child for not wearing a
[39:34.560 --> 39:42.800]  face mask on the bus I think we know where that person falls politically so
[39:42.800 --> 39:45.440]  there you go there's the two differences between the left and the right a
[39:45.440 --> 39:49.040]  young girl on the right well spoken inspirational gives a speech in front of
[39:49.040 --> 39:52.440]  parents and teachers and students get surrounding applause liberal bus driver
[39:52.440 --> 39:57.880]  smacks a girl in the face 10 years old for not wearing a mask I'm not gonna say
[39:57.880 --> 40:01.320]  this five times on the road to the obnoxious I'm saying it because it's
[40:01.320 --> 40:06.720]  the key to victory over these criminals last week the arch globalist Fauci
[40:06.720 --> 40:13.000]  admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers medical doctors
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.560]  scientists nurses you name it have taken the so-called COVID-19 franken shot
[40:17.560 --> 40:23.800]  I'm gonna say the second time around half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH
[40:23.800 --> 40:30.520]  refused to take the franken shots they don't trust it you shouldn't trust it
[40:30.520 --> 40:33.920]  the vaccines have been banned in most countries around the world this is an
[40:33.920 --> 40:38.880]  attack on the American people the people of the world this is an absolute red
[40:38.880 --> 40:43.680]  flag smoking gun again let me say it two more times around half the
[40:43.680 --> 40:47.880]  individuals that work at the NIH and CDC the medical staff refused to take the
[40:47.880 --> 40:53.880]  vaccines that's right the doctors nurses do not trust a so-called vaccine and you
[40:53.880 --> 40:57.520]  should either everyone you know about the truth when listeners call to the show
[40:57.520 --> 41:01.880]  and thank me for all I've done I always stop them and I say thank you for what

[42:57.080 --> 43:01.920]  14 months ago I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world
[43:01.920 --> 43:06.680]  collapses the third world dies we have such a complex civilization with so many
[43:06.680 --> 43:11.160]  billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world it causes a
[43:11.160 --> 43:15.280]  chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first
[43:15.280 --> 43:19.200]  world well now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States
[43:19.200 --> 43:23.120]  that's because the companies and the systems of the drivers that can barely
[43:23.120 --> 43:27.120]  get the job done before delivering gas have been shut down plus the keystone
[43:27.120 --> 43:30.920]  pipelines been shut down a lot of other pipelines the left is now blowing up
[43:30.920 --> 43:35.760]  dams across the US we're being shut down our coal power plants are off as well
[43:35.760 --> 43:40.320]  ladies and gentlemen prepare to be a total slave the third world is imploding
[43:40.320 --> 43:43.560]  as well the borders have been removed until you wake up and this is a globalist
[43:43.560 --> 43:47.760]  chai-com takeover great reset you have no hope they're announcing that there will
[43:47.760 --> 43:52.880]  be less than two-thirds the gas needed this summer so they told you that you're
[43:52.880 --> 43:58.040]  under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family
[43:58.040 --> 44:04.680]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[44:18.440 --> 44:23.440]  Henry Kissinger clow swab the whole globalist system that they've inherited
[44:23.440 --> 44:26.840]  from the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds think they're God but they're not
[44:26.840 --> 44:30.560]  God they didn't create this planet they create the sun they create the universe
[44:30.560 --> 44:35.360]  they create the trillions and trillions of galaxies that we know exist they
[44:35.360 --> 44:40.240]  can't even comprehend God or how to be just good people all they are selfish
[44:40.240 --> 44:45.040]  demons that seek to take control of your life seek to harness humanity and
[44:45.040 --> 44:48.760]  convince us that they are superior to us and that we have to serve them and
[44:48.760 --> 44:53.240]  their ideas they want control of our bodies with their nanotech with their
[44:53.240 --> 44:56.800]  genetic engineering they want us to accept the fact that they can put in our
[44:56.800 --> 45:00.440]  bodies what they want when they want and then lie to us about the fact they
[45:00.440 --> 45:05.720]  call it a vaccine when it is gene therapy this is all about their quest for
[45:05.720 --> 45:10.960]  eternal life they are testing on the general public trying to find compounds
[45:10.960 --> 45:15.520]  from toxic experiments they give them what they call the Lazarus gene and
[45:15.520 --> 45:20.840]  other systems are searching for it all started in the 1950s when they discovered
[45:20.840 --> 45:27.200]  immortal cell lines cells that never die and replicate forever we call it of
[45:27.200 --> 45:33.760]  course the more vicious types of cancer but through death and through mass
[45:33.760 --> 45:37.880]  experimentation against the general population they believe they will find
[45:37.880 --> 45:42.080]  the keys to immortality so as you see the beauty of the universe that God gave
[45:42.080 --> 45:47.600]  us realize the globalists are not God the globalists are simply parasites who
[45:47.600 --> 45:51.440]  are selfishly trying to take control of your life in a hope of artificially
[45:51.440 --> 45:56.560]  building immortality for themselves when immortality has been given to us by God
[45:56.560 --> 46:01.040]  through our consciousness if we choose to be with God and not serve ourselves and
[46:01.040 --> 46:05.880]  be selfish entities and that's the truth and that's what info war stands for is
[46:05.880 --> 46:10.040]  getting you to think for yourself and to get outside the box and realize that God
[46:10.040 --> 46:14.560]  created the universe for us to have communion with God not for us to pretend
[46:14.560 --> 46:19.120]  that we are God those that try to do that we have a name for them they're called
[46:19.120 --> 46:23.520]  saints they believe that Lucifer could be his own God just as they could be the
[46:23.520 --> 46:28.960]  real God just as in the story of Adam and Eve in the Bible Satan says to Eve you
[46:28.960 --> 46:33.400]  could be a God she goes Adam says you can be a God just eat up this creed of the
[46:33.400 --> 46:37.920]  knowledge of good and evil the knowledge of evil we were perfect and
[46:37.920 --> 46:41.360]  innocent we had only the knowledge of good knowledge of evil is how to
[46:41.360 --> 46:45.400]  manipulate how to twist how to set up corrupt criminal systems how to play
[46:45.400 --> 46:51.080]  God as it was in the days of Noah so will it be in the days of the son of man
[46:51.080 --> 46:55.960]  and we're entering those days now I'm Alex Jones this is info wars tomorrow
[46:55.960 --> 46:58.640]  news today
[47:02.840 --> 47:08.600]  and we're back here in the info wars world headquarters
[47:08.600 --> 47:15.400]  I'll enjoy your taking the Alex Jones show all the way today and then who do we
[47:15.400 --> 47:22.000]  have coming up guys in the fourth hour and then Matt Bracken always great as
[47:22.000 --> 47:25.080]  well it'll be my pleasure to be with you until that time and then we're gonna have
[47:25.080 --> 47:31.000]  a very exciting war room guest host today so I'll be announcing that coming
[47:31.000 --> 47:36.840]  up shortly as well but you know I gotta say I'm just looking at all this news
[47:36.840 --> 47:41.520]  in front of me deciding where to go and there's a couple stories that really
[47:41.520 --> 47:46.920]  just show how I mean
[47:47.920 --> 47:56.800]  there's a way that we used to deal with people like this and we just don't deal
[47:56.800 --> 48:01.360]  with them at all now they just dominate us what am I talking about I'm talking
[48:01.360 --> 48:07.960]  about lying politicians corrupt leaders just liars in general people to get caught
[48:07.960 --> 48:13.000]  screwing people over left and right people that run their own corrupt
[48:13.000 --> 48:17.000]  operations and then get caught well nowadays these people just get into
[48:17.000 --> 48:20.640]  government get on television media and then control our lives because we don't
[48:20.640 --> 48:23.440]  deal with them anymore we just we just let them run rock or let them run wild
[48:23.440 --> 48:34.960]  and so you just had the house approve a bill one point nine billion dollars to
[48:34.960 --> 48:40.400]  bolster capital security why well of course you know why January 6th same old
[48:40.400 --> 48:53.360]  one and the FBI is releasing videos and asking for help in their arrests from
[48:53.360 --> 48:57.640]  January 6th so they're still releasing videos from inside outside the capital
[48:57.640 --> 49:01.040]  of people saying help us identify these people they're admitting they've already
[49:01.040 --> 49:06.280]  arrested over 400 people they put them in jail funny that they're on they're
[49:06.280 --> 49:08.920]  already putting us in gulags they're already arresting their political
[49:08.920 --> 49:11.400]  opposition they're already censoring their political opposition they're
[49:11.400 --> 49:16.000]  already physically attacking their political opposition we just don't
[49:16.000 --> 49:20.440]  fight back I mean I don't know how else to say it I don't know how else to
[49:20.440 --> 49:24.440]  portray this situation other than just the complete accuracy here the complete
[49:24.440 --> 49:33.360]  truth what's the irony what's the hypocrisy well isn't it obvious there's
[49:33.360 --> 49:39.480]  no FBI mass release of videos or call for help in arresting any of the
[49:39.480 --> 49:44.520]  individuals involved in the riots of 2020 the Democrat riots that caused over
[49:44.520 --> 49:48.920]  two billion dollars in property damage they don't they have no interest in
[49:48.920 --> 49:51.560]  that they're not arresting people for that they're not asking for help
[49:51.560 --> 49:55.760]  identifying people in that a lot of murders lots of attacks on police
[49:55.760 --> 50:02.800]  thousands were hospitalized a lot died FBI not interested but hey you had
[50:02.800 --> 50:06.640]  about you had about four or five hours that got out of control at the Capitol
[50:06.640 --> 50:12.960]  which which it was it was isolated where some of the out of control behavior was
[50:12.960 --> 50:17.200]  and that's like the worst thing that's ever happened now there's two angles to
[50:17.200 --> 50:22.520]  this it is it our politicians that selfish that they only care about
[50:22.520 --> 50:26.320]  January 6th because it happened where they work where they live and so it
[50:26.320 --> 50:29.960]  actually affected them so they care about it whereas when it happens in your
[50:29.960 --> 50:33.400]  backyard when it happens in your neighborhood when it happens in your
[50:33.400 --> 50:37.760]  city when it happens to your business they just don't care so is it selfishness
[50:37.760 --> 50:45.880]  or is it that they are now just openly setting the precedent that if you're a
[50:45.880 --> 50:52.520]  liberal leftist any level of demonstration is okay rioting murdering
[50:52.520 --> 50:58.800]  looting arson all the violent crime in the world is okay as long as you're a
[50:58.800 --> 51:03.960]  liberal leftist Democrat voter it's okay FBI is okay with it politicians are
[51:03.960 --> 51:11.280]  okay with it media is okay with it but if you're a Trump supporting American
[51:11.280 --> 51:16.000]  Patriot that's sick of our elections being rigged and you go into DC that's
[51:16.000 --> 51:22.200]  not allowed that's a crime that's a bad thing many of the businesses destroyed
[51:22.200 --> 51:25.880]  from the Democrat riots of 2020 will never be back in business many of the
[51:25.880 --> 51:31.000]  people who were injured or killed their lives will never be the same the events
[51:31.000 --> 51:35.440]  of January 6th had zero long-term effects for most people except people
[51:35.440 --> 51:40.520]  that were murdered there by police that would be Ashley Babbitt but you notice
[51:40.520 --> 51:48.000]  we don't get to know about who killed her either so it's the total revelation
[51:48.000 --> 51:53.520]  it's the emperor has no clothes it's the double standard it's the hypocrisy it's
[51:53.520 --> 51:59.760]  all of it it's all right there it's wide open universally objectively evaluated
[51:59.760 --> 52:05.640]  and observed you cannot deny it there's a two-tier justice system there's a two
[52:05.640 --> 52:10.080]  tier approach for justice there's a two-tier approach to covering it and
[52:10.080 --> 52:18.720]  and there's there's some free speech is allowed others is not other free speech
[52:18.720 --> 52:31.840]  bat and we know it's on political lines but it's almost even more diabolical when
[52:31.840 --> 52:38.240]  the same Democrats who run around chanting defund the police signing
[52:38.240 --> 52:41.760]  legislation to defund the police proposing legislation to defund police
[52:41.760 --> 52:48.920]  rallying people to defund police and then give themselves two billion dollars for
[52:48.920 --> 53:06.160]  security it's so evil it's so disgusting it's it's honestly it's like it's not
[53:06.160 --> 53:14.160]  that I'm speechless it's just that it's so obvious it's so out of control it's
[53:14.160 --> 53:18.520]  so ridiculous if we're gonna allow this to happen you know I shouldn't have to
[53:18.520 --> 53:22.040]  come out here and break this down in fact I don't that's the point it's all
[53:22.040 --> 53:28.800]  wide open the emperor has no clothes the emperor is walking down Main Street on a
[53:28.800 --> 53:34.280]  busy weekend with thousands of people walking around with no clothes on I don't
[53:34.280 --> 53:37.320]  have to point there and say look he's naked I don't have to point out and say
[53:37.320 --> 53:41.480]  look the emperor's naked look it's the emperor's wee wee and behind I don't have
[53:41.480 --> 53:48.440]  to do that it's obvious it's out there it's it's anybody can see it so why is
[53:48.440 --> 53:59.000]  it here we are yet again and now and now you have the house backs the January 6
[53:59.000 --> 54:02.360]  Commission they want to do a investigation into that not into the
[54:02.360 --> 54:07.400]  keystone pipeline or excuse me not into the colonial pipeline hack not into the
[54:07.400 --> 54:12.360]  billions of damage caused in the year 2020 not into the illegal spying of the
[54:12.360 --> 54:17.120]  Obama administration in the fake PP gate dossier and the fake Manafort black
[54:17.120 --> 54:24.960]  book no no no no investigations into any of that and we have the list I'll cover
[54:24.960 --> 54:30.680]  this list when we come back 35 Republicans vote with Democrats to hold
[54:30.680 --> 54:36.080]  9-11 style Commission into January 6th and you know if they get this folks what
[54:36.080 --> 54:40.680]  they're gonna do so I'll explain it all coming up and I'll give you that list of
[54:40.680 --> 54:46.920]  the anti-American Communist Republicans who voted against the truth I'm up here
[54:46.920 --> 54:51.440]  working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021 and I just want to say
[54:51.440 --> 54:55.480]  something I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has
[54:55.480 --> 54:58.960]  come together over the years it is truly an answer to prayer and I am so blessed
[54:58.960 --> 55:02.200]  and thankful for all of you the listeners of the show I want you to know
[55:02.200 --> 55:06.080]  that I love you and I appreciate you whether you are old whether you are
[55:06.080 --> 55:09.600]  Hispanic white black it doesn't matter you got red blood and if you love
[55:09.600 --> 55:13.720]  freedom and justice and if you love our innocent children we are brothers and

[56:52.240 --> 56:55.640]  Alex Jones show
[56:55.640 --> 57:14.600]  you know I'm not sure what's more dangerous the fact that the government
[57:14.600 --> 57:20.160]  wants to have a medical tyranny situation where they can force you to
[57:20.160 --> 57:23.720]  inject anything into your body consume anything and the precedent that that
[57:23.720 --> 57:31.320]  sets or the fact that the Democrat Party and and most of our politicians and
[57:31.320 --> 57:37.120]  media are now completely okay with the two tiered to standard justice system
[57:37.120 --> 57:41.360]  where one side of the political aisle in this country gets free speech gets to be
[57:41.360 --> 57:44.840]  violent gets to do whatever you want whereas the other side if they step on
[57:44.840 --> 57:49.360]  a crack or break a stick you know in a park get a full investigation from the
[57:49.360 --> 57:53.880]  FBI or perhaps it's the confluence of both of those things that has me so
[57:53.880 --> 58:00.400]  shocked appalled and afraid of where this country is going but first take a
[58:00.400 --> 58:04.040]  look at the brainwashed stuges that we have in Washington DC these are all
[58:04.040 --> 58:07.360]  all leftist liberals the dumbest people that walk among us they drive on our
[58:07.360 --> 58:11.440]  roads scary to think that isn't it these people drive on roads next to you my
[58:11.440 --> 58:16.600]  god that's a hazard right there these people are a walking hazard for a
[58:16.600 --> 58:20.920]  functioning society the average day modern progressive liberal so here they
[58:20.920 --> 58:25.320]  are in DC explaining why they won't take off their masks why because we're not
[58:25.320 --> 58:30.840]  protected 100% from COVID so even if you have your vaccine it's you can still get
[58:30.840 --> 58:36.040]  it oh so it doesn't work got it hey I'm Lisa with a collar today we are in
[58:36.040 --> 58:40.800]  Washington DC where a lot of people are still wearing their mask outside despite
[58:40.800 --> 58:44.400]  the new CDC guidelines we're gonna ask them why why are you still wearing a
[58:44.400 --> 58:48.200]  mask and are you vaccinated yeah so thank you for that question I am
[58:48.200 --> 58:52.880]  vaccinated and I am a bit skeptical of their decision because I feel like the
[58:52.880 --> 58:57.400]  coronavirus doesn't go away after the CDC says it's okay I mean I thought it was
[58:57.400 --> 59:01.960]  a little premature this CDC guidelines a little concerning to see that a lot of
[59:01.960 --> 59:05.360]  people outside are not wearing it I don't want to get other people like to
[59:05.360 --> 59:08.200]  think that it's okay not to wear a mask if they aren't vaccinated I don't want
[59:08.200 --> 59:11.680]  it to make it look normal that you cannot wear your mask I feel like people
[59:11.680 --> 59:17.680]  still should wear their mask hi are you why are you still wearing a mask just
[59:17.680 --> 59:22.560]  pre-conscious extra cautious for my safety and health I mean when I walk
[59:22.560 --> 59:26.680]  around sometimes in close proximity to people that aren't masks and give the
[59:26.680 --> 59:31.680]  vaccine yet yes I had two shots already fully vaccinated and if we are
[59:31.680 --> 59:37.560]  vaccinated I don't think the top like it's all happening so fast time will tell
[59:37.560 --> 59:42.160]  just how protected we are with the vaccinations because who knows with the
[59:42.160 --> 59:46.840]  new strains that are coming out and until we know that the city is safe I
[59:46.840 --> 59:50.880]  think if you're outside it's gonna be okay but like till we know we should
[59:50.880 --> 59:55.120]  remain vigilant in the meantime and we don't know who has it or the jokers out
[59:55.120 --> 1:00:02.320]  there I just I'm hot I think there should be some kind some way where you
[1:00:02.320 --> 1:00:08.280]  can see if others have been vaccinated or not then if you can easily spot that
[1:00:08.280 --> 1:00:12.880]  he wants the vaccine cards in his pants you can remove your mask well we're
[1:00:12.880 --> 1:00:17.000]  doing it because it's a professional look it's we're at work right now and we
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:21.400]  deal in the public space so we do try and encourage the message for people to
[1:00:21.400 --> 1:00:24.640]  feel still comfortable because I don't I haven't been vaccinated so that's why I
[1:00:24.640 --> 1:00:28.240]  have to remember I haven't gotten my second dose yet so I know I'm like not
[1:00:28.240 --> 1:00:33.680]  fully vaccinated outdoors I think it's a little more safe as my mask is falling
[1:00:33.680 --> 1:00:37.680]  down I'm not gonna lie when I'm not working I do tend to keep my mask down
[1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:41.920]  in public but we are also encouraging people that if they go into our
[1:00:41.920 --> 1:00:46.280]  businesses we still want our business owners and all of the patrons for those
[1:00:46.280 --> 1:00:51.040]  businesses to feel comfortable indoors is what concerns me like movie theaters
[1:00:51.040 --> 1:00:55.760]  and the idea of being able to go to concerts or things like that but I feel
[1:00:55.760 --> 1:01:00.680]  like at this point if you're fully vaccinated and outside and being
[1:01:00.680 --> 1:01:05.080]  responsible with your business I think it's okay to not wear a mask oh I just
[1:01:05.080 --> 1:01:09.720]  walked out of the store so I just always forget to take it off but I think it's
[1:01:09.720 --> 1:01:15.400]  pretty safe to not wear it when you're in like a not crowded area when I go in
[1:01:15.400 --> 1:01:22.000]  the store so I just leave it on I don't want no mask folks I mean there's so
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:25.960]  many things I could sit here and point out I mean like what's the most obvious
[1:01:25.960 --> 1:01:37.800]  thing the mask doesn't stop COVID the mask doesn't stop COVID so we're living
[1:01:37.800 --> 1:01:41.920]  in the land of complete liberal idiots liberalism is a mental disorder and they
[1:01:41.920 --> 1:01:45.400]  want to make it a thing where these people can vote us into tyranny these
[1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:49.200]  people can vote us into the craziest stupidest crap you've ever heard of like
[1:01:49.200 --> 1:01:53.080]  chopping your your child's genitals off because they were addressed one day I
[1:01:53.080 --> 1:01:57.680]  mean seriously this is out of control listen up Patriots I'm running a sale
[1:01:57.680 --> 1:02:01.440]  that's the biggest I've ever run on three products that are already selling out

[1:02:46.440 --> 1:02:50.960]  through Sunday and the deal is over best deal ever take advantage of it at
[1:02:50.960 --> 1:02:55.880]  infowarstore.com and fund the Info War
[1:02:55.880 --> 1:03:11.920]  live from the info wars.com studios you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:03:11.920 --> 1:03:22.240]  and now your host Owen Shroyer alright as I told you I'm gonna tell you the
[1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:29.240]  list of Republicans who voted for the 9-11 South Commission investigation into
[1:03:29.240 --> 1:03:33.520]  January 6th which of course means anybody who is there they'll come after
[1:03:33.520 --> 1:03:37.040]  and they'll arrest and they'll destroy their lives that that's what they're
[1:03:37.040 --> 1:03:42.480]  really saying and they want to make it an equivalent that oh whoever
[1:03:42.480 --> 1:03:46.800]  orchestrated 9-11 and driving planes in the Twin Towers killing thousands of
[1:03:46.800 --> 1:03:50.720]  people you're on the equivalent of your grandma that's that's on the equivalent
[1:03:50.720 --> 1:03:53.720]  imagine that that's what they're arguing here that's what the liberal
[1:03:53.720 --> 1:03:58.720]  media is arguing the Democrats are arguing that your grandma who walked
[1:03:58.720 --> 1:04:03.120]  into DC on January 6th with an American flag or a Trump flag is just as
[1:04:03.120 --> 1:04:08.720]  guilty as somebody who flew a plane into the Twin Towers on 9-11 or the person
[1:04:08.720 --> 1:04:13.560]  that funded and orchestrated that event that's what they're now trying to say
[1:04:13.560 --> 1:04:22.680]  that's what they're trying to perpetuate here you know I've realized
[1:04:22.680 --> 1:04:30.840]  something I think and I really don't know how info wars adjusts to this this
[1:04:30.840 --> 1:04:40.160]  understanding now but I don't know if it's info wars role needs to change or
[1:04:40.160 --> 1:04:46.440]  something because here's the deal with what the Democrats are doing and the
[1:04:46.440 --> 1:04:53.120]  media is doing and and all this pushback against human freedom and just
[1:04:53.120 --> 1:05:00.920]  everything they stand for now it's so bad it's so obvious I mean we still need
[1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:05.720]  to be here to report the news that nobody else is gonna tell you but I mean the
[1:05:05.720 --> 1:05:09.160]  liberal media is so out of control in their lives the Democrat Party is so
[1:05:09.160 --> 1:05:14.320]  out of control in their lives and their tyranny I mean
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:22.280]  they're asking for a fight and it's not a fight that that we want and that's why
[1:05:22.280 --> 1:05:25.360]  we haven't had it yet and that's why they just continue to oppress us and lie
[1:05:25.360 --> 1:05:36.000]  to us and and goose up us into tyranny and so it's just it's just stunning to
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:42.680]  me that this is happening I don't even know I mean how our politicians can be
[1:05:42.680 --> 1:05:48.320]  so committed to disproven lies to disproven theories to disproven
[1:05:48.320 --> 1:05:51.440]  narratives and they just don't back off they just stick with every single one of
[1:05:51.440 --> 1:05:57.720]  them no shame I mean it's just unbelievable and it doesn't even matter
[1:05:57.720 --> 1:06:01.920]  that you have half the Democrat Party fractured right now saying we need to be
[1:06:01.920 --> 1:06:08.800]  pro Hamas pro Palestine by the way you know there's probably you know the
[1:06:08.800 --> 1:06:12.600]  Palestinians are really getting getting used and abused worse than anyone here
[1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:15.960]  by Hamas because they're just like this political football getting tossed back
[1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:19.360]  and forth and then they just throw rocks at Israel now they got bombs going over
[1:06:19.360 --> 1:06:26.120]  their head and the weapons manufacturers make money and the politicians who get
[1:06:26.120 --> 1:06:30.080]  money from them make more camp get more campaign contributions and the people
[1:06:30.080 --> 1:06:33.720]  that have stock options in the weapons manufacturers make money so they all
[1:06:33.720 --> 1:06:41.200]  love it they love the constant war I mean it's just it's just out of control but
[1:06:41.200 --> 1:06:46.800]  let me just try to focus and read you this list here so here are the 35
[1:06:46.800 --> 1:06:53.520]  Republicans who think that Americans with American flags in the Capitol on
[1:06:53.520 --> 1:06:59.160]  DC are equal to terrorists on September 11th here are the 35 Republicans that
[1:06:59.160 --> 1:07:03.440]  think you and American that know the election was stolen from Trump are as
[1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:09.000]  bad as a terrorist on 9-11 bacon Republican Nebraska Bench or I guess
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:14.520]  they're all these are all Republicans bacon in Nebraska Benson organ vice in
[1:07:14.520 --> 1:07:20.520]  Oklahoma Liz Cheney Wyoming who's surprised by that Curtis Utah Davis in
[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:28.720]  Illinois Fitzpatrick Pennsylvania Fortinbury Nebraska Garbarino New York
[1:07:28.720 --> 1:07:38.280]  Jimenez Florida Gonzales Texas Gonzales Ohio guest Mississippi Herrera Butler
[1:07:38.280 --> 1:07:45.720]  Washington Hill Arkansas Hollingsworth Indiana Jacobs New York Johnson South
[1:07:45.720 --> 1:07:53.640]  Dakota Joyce Ohio Catco New York who co-sponsored the bill Kensinger Illinois
[1:07:53.640 --> 1:08:01.680]  McKinley West Virginia Meyer Michigan Miller Meeks Iowa Moore Utah Newhouse
[1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:08.440]  Washington Reed New York Rice South Carolina Salazar Florida Simpson Idaho
[1:08:08.440 --> 1:08:16.240]  Smith New Jersey Taylor Texas Upton Michigan Validale California Womack
[1:08:16.240 --> 1:08:23.000]  Arkansas so there are your Republicans that think Americans in Washington DC
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:29.400]  is equivalent to terrorists blowing up twin towers and murdering thousands of
[1:08:29.400 --> 1:08:38.480]  people and there are I believe 13 of these who also voted to impeach Trump
[1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:44.760]  Liz Cheney Wyoming Gonzales Ohio Herrera Butler Washington Catco New York
[1:08:44.760 --> 1:08:50.000]  Kensinger Illinois Meyer Michigan Newhouse Washington Rice South Carolina
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:09:00.160]  Upton Michigan Validale California they all voted also for impeachment now I
[1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:05.440]  have a hard time I you see a lot of people excited about this thinking we're
[1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:08.600]  gonna primary all of these people look at these strong Republican districts where
[1:09:08.600 --> 1:09:11.480]  we can put in real American first Republicans hey you know what that's
[1:09:11.480 --> 1:09:17.960]  great this is a political you know the political approach to this the
[1:09:17.960 --> 1:09:24.320]  Democratic approach to this you know one man one vote use logic and reasoning
[1:09:24.320 --> 1:09:29.760]  and the power of information to sway votes but we don't live in a fair world
[1:09:29.760 --> 1:09:37.320]  we don't have equal free speech and we don't even have fair elections so I
[1:09:37.320 --> 1:09:42.320]  can't hop on that train of hope I can't hop on that train of this can be a good
[1:09:42.320 --> 1:09:58.320]  thing it's not that I am a pessimist I'm just a realist and again how can we even
[1:09:58.320 --> 1:10:05.040]  be at this point how can we even be at such a point of darkness where any
[1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:12.800]  neutral fair observer would tell you that all of the writing and and and the
[1:10:12.800 --> 1:10:19.000]  violence from the summer of 2020 is a million times worse than what happened
[1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:23.040]  on January 6th but you get no investigation into that the FBI makes
[1:10:23.040 --> 1:10:27.040]  no comments or investigations on that the CIA has nothing to say about that the
[1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:32.840]  media says it's all peaceful and then you have about five hours of a pocket of
[1:10:32.840 --> 1:10:37.760]  out-of-control demonstrators in Washington DC after our election got
[1:10:37.760 --> 1:10:42.320]  stolen and that's the worst event since 9-11 and you have a full-on investigation
[1:10:42.320 --> 1:10:46.120]  hundreds of people arrested and thrown in jail they're only beginning and they
[1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:50.800]  want to full-on launch this investigation or call it a 9-11 style
[1:10:50.800 --> 1:10:54.240]  commission so that they can label these people terrorists and lock them up
[1:10:54.240 --> 1:10:58.400]  forever and then permanently chill anyone's free speech that's pro-america
[1:10:58.400 --> 1:11:02.320]  so you'll be too afraid to go to DC you'll be too afraid to say you like
[1:11:02.320 --> 1:11:05.840]  Trump you'll be too afraid to say you voted for Trump you'll be too afraid to
[1:11:05.840 --> 1:11:09.000]  say that you think the elections are rigged that's what they want to do they
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:13.840]  want to make this such a criminal stronghold here in the United States of
[1:11:13.840 --> 1:11:18.640]  America that they can't have any political opposition to the New World Order
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:23.200]  globalist takeover to communism that's what they want and they have to use
[1:11:23.200 --> 1:11:28.760]  January 6th as their example to put every American in fear they don't want you
[1:11:28.760 --> 1:11:32.640]  to have free speech and they don't want you to talk about all the corruption
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:38.480]  that's happening in government and if they get away with this we'll see if it
[1:11:38.480 --> 1:11:42.520]  passes in the Senate Mitch McConnell has said that he'll he'll try to stop this
[1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:49.200]  from passing but I don't trust Mitch McConnell at all he could flip overnight
[1:11:49.200 --> 1:11:59.040]  so on one hand they're trying to introduce medical tyranny with forced
[1:11:59.040 --> 1:12:02.560]  vaccinations and then on the other hand they're trying to introduce political
[1:12:02.560 --> 1:12:08.040]  tyranny by labeling their opposition as criminals and terrorists so that nobody
[1:12:08.040 --> 1:12:11.240]  ever opposes them again
[1:12:11.240 --> 1:12:22.440]  very frightening stuff and so I don't pause for effect I don't pause because I
[1:12:22.440 --> 1:12:25.880]  don't have enough to say I got stacks of news here I got video clips I could
[1:12:25.880 --> 1:12:31.520]  talk all frickin day I'm pausing because this is so overwhelming and this is so
[1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:39.960]  dangerous it's just stunning it's paralyzing it's paralyzing to look into
[1:12:39.960 --> 1:12:45.120]  this it's paralyzing to see what's incoming it's paralyzing to understand
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:50.600]  the history and know where this goes so we take it seriously here at info wars
[1:12:50.600 --> 1:12:55.880]  I suggest the rest of the media wake up and does as well you know it's crazy to
[1:12:55.880 --> 1:12:59.440]  get to this point it's very bittersweet everything we've talked about this
[1:12:59.440 --> 1:13:02.840]  happened just like we said it would and now we have a lot of credibility but I
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:05.840]  don't care about that I care about beating the new world order and it's
[1:13:05.840 --> 1:13:09.480]  because we have so much credibility they can't allow us to stay on air much
[1:13:09.480 --> 1:13:13.160]  longer and I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us for a
[1:13:13.160 --> 1:13:16.520]  lot of reasons I can't tell you what's going on but let's just say this we're
[1:13:16.520 --> 1:13:20.920]  gonna see this through the end we're gonna stay on air as long as we can so
[1:13:20.920 --> 1:13:24.360]  please pray for us and please buy the products and then for store.com
[1:13:24.360 --> 1:13:28.320]  they're great products plus they fund the operation so you know unlike other
[1:13:28.320 --> 1:13:31.520]  products you can buy they're still great do they fund freedom no a lot of them
[1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:36.280]  don't these are great products that fund freedom and fund justice when the whole
[1:13:36.280 --> 1:13:40.000]  world's waking up and looking for truth that's why the globalists are censoring
[1:13:40.000 --> 1:13:43.880]  they can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us from the air so
[1:13:43.880 --> 1:13:46.360]  while you're at it don't just financially support us and spread the word
[1:13:46.360 --> 1:13:50.400]  download everything we've done you can find and save it because who knows how
[1:13:50.400 --> 1:13:53.680]  long we're gonna be on the air and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we
[1:13:53.680 --> 1:13:58.200]  ever said one of the most common questions I get on air but also off air
[1:13:58.200 --> 1:14:03.320]  when I'm just out and about is Alex what do I say to my family about the
[1:14:03.320 --> 1:14:08.280]  vaccines how do I warn them well the problem is there's so many problems with
[1:14:08.280 --> 1:14:11.840]  it so many facts it's the history of contaminated vaccines the fact that they
[1:14:11.840 --> 1:14:15.920]  have liability protection in the US and Europe the fact that they've been caught
[1:14:15.920 --> 1:14:20.000]  adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines and the whole
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:24.560]  history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks poor whites
[1:14:24.560 --> 1:14:29.280]  Native Americans the list goes on and on but what about the fact that Fauci
[1:14:29.280 --> 1:14:35.240]  testified to Congress and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021 that
[1:14:35.240 --> 1:14:40.960]  around half of the NIH CDC staff medical doctors or all just scientists have
[1:14:40.960 --> 1:14:44.320]  refused to take the vaccine and don't take it safe yeah I think what half of
[1:14:44.320 --> 1:14:47.720]  the doctors are scared to take it that's the same thing in the private
[1:14:47.720 --> 1:14:50.240]  practices out there somewhere numbers that that's not something I'm gonna be
[1:14:50.240 --> 1:14:59.160]  taken that's very very simple there's your answer you're listening to the Alex
[1:14:59.160 --> 1:15:22.680]  Jones show we're back here on the Alex Jones show

[1:18:29.400 --> 1:18:34.120]  story was just handed to me with the headline Pentagon reportedly running
[1:18:34.120 --> 1:18:41.240]  secret army of sixty thousand around the world and here's here's really the juicy
[1:18:41.240 --> 1:18:48.840]  of this story the Pentagon is running sixty thousand strong secret army made
[1:18:48.840 --> 1:18:53.600]  up of soldiers civilians and contractors who travel the world under false
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:58.520]  identities embedded in consultancies and name brand companies without the
[1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:02.240]  knowledge of the American people or most Congress according to a report so what
[1:19:02.240 --> 1:19:06.680]  are these commies are these leftist commies that the Pentagon is sitting
[1:19:06.680 --> 1:19:15.400]  around or is this really a pro-america cause somehow I doubt it somehow I doubt
[1:19:15.400 --> 1:19:22.440]  it the force is ten times the size of the covert elements of the CIA comes with
[1:19:22.440 --> 1:19:29.360]  the cost of more than ninety million dollars and engages about a hundred and
[1:19:29.360 --> 1:19:34.040]  thirty private companies and operations in locales like the Middle East and
[1:19:34.040 --> 1:19:41.800]  Africa according to the report Congress however has never heard of this never
[1:19:41.800 --> 1:19:50.440]  had a hearing on it never approved it just the government stealing more of
[1:19:50.440 --> 1:19:57.920]  our money and then using it for their own agenda that is not America first isn't
[1:19:57.920 --> 1:20:05.720]  that nice isn't that just something like what they're doing to Donald Trump
[1:20:05.720 --> 1:20:09.880]  right now or what they're doing to Roger Stone right now who will be joining us
[1:20:09.880 --> 1:20:15.040]  shortly president Trump responds to news he's being criminally investigated by
[1:20:15.040 --> 1:20:22.280]  New York Attorney General if these prosecutors focused on real issues crime
[1:20:22.280 --> 1:20:26.560]  would be obliterated and New York would be great and free again that's a direct
[1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:37.280]  quote from Trump's response but yeah they are going after Trump again and I
[1:20:37.280 --> 1:20:42.960]  believe they've even been told yeah yeah it's a criminal investigation it's not a
[1:20:42.960 --> 1:20:53.000]  civil investigation so they're so they're ramping it up man you know I don't
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:59.640]  know who makes these ads but Dan Scavino yesterday released like another one
[1:20:59.640 --> 1:21:03.280]  of these Trump ads like these powerful Trump ads and I was watching I was
[1:21:03.280 --> 1:21:07.080]  thinking about it because I haven't really been I mean I don't really get too
[1:21:07.080 --> 1:21:13.200]  excited about Donald Trump these days hey good for him he's playing golf he was a
[1:21:13.200 --> 1:21:17.880]  great president I voted for him I wish he was president not Biden obviously he
[1:21:17.880 --> 1:21:22.200]  won the election but it's hard for me to really get excited about this stuff but
[1:21:22.200 --> 1:21:31.320]  but I was watching the video and it kind of just hit me he's planning something
[1:21:31.320 --> 1:21:37.920]  probably to run again I guess is the plan there because I don't know why they
[1:21:37.920 --> 1:21:44.600]  would but no not Biden hacking it up for a photo shoot on the golf course but
[1:21:44.600 --> 1:21:48.440]  Trump's actually golfing I don't know if he's good at golf but better than Biden
[1:21:48.440 --> 1:21:56.200]  I bet you so I think Trump is probably planning on running for president again
[1:21:56.200 --> 1:22:01.280]  otherwise why would they be putting out these ads all the time here's the rub
[1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:10.520]  to me though I have a hard time really getting that excited about another
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:16.040]  Trump run because not because he didn't do a great job or because I don't think
[1:22:16.040 --> 1:22:20.560]  he'd be the best man for the job it's just I get all kinds of stuff from Trump's
[1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:24.160]  people and it's all about the vaccines and it's all about Operation Warfee I
[1:22:24.160 --> 1:22:31.320]  want nothing to do with that and the Republican Party is just a complete mess
[1:22:31.320 --> 1:22:36.200]  quite frankly other than a few individuals within it and I'm sick of
[1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:39.880]  getting these you know I'm sure you get them to emails from the Republican Party
[1:22:39.880 --> 1:22:44.600]  like at now help us stop this bill help us stop this tyranny help us do this
[1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:48.840]  help us do this and they never do any of it they don't do any of it but they
[1:22:48.840 --> 1:22:54.680]  take your money all the Republican Party does is raise money they've done
[1:22:54.680 --> 1:23:00.320]  nothing for us they vote on bills that go against us they vote on bills to
[1:23:00.320 --> 1:23:06.600]  investigate us all the Republican Party does is collect money and you have an
[1:23:06.600 --> 1:23:10.640]  element of the Republican Party that wants to get rid of Trump or Pelosi
[1:23:10.640 --> 1:23:15.440]  says Republicans need to get it in control their party again meaning take
[1:23:15.440 --> 1:23:19.200]  back control from we the people that voted for Trump take back control from
[1:23:19.200 --> 1:23:26.120]  the organic grassroots movement that that was behind Trump go back to the one
[1:23:26.120 --> 1:23:30.200]  party fake two-party system of the politicians screwing us all over and
[1:23:30.200 --> 1:23:36.560]  get these American-loving people like Trump out of any involvement but Trump
[1:23:36.560 --> 1:23:39.640]  obviously is is planning on running or planning on doing something otherwise
[1:23:39.640 --> 1:23:46.840]  why would they be releasing these ads but man I mean things are so bad now I
[1:23:46.840 --> 1:23:52.080]  just I just can't see really getting any hope behind Donald Trump at this point
[1:23:52.080 --> 1:23:55.840]  for a year of running four years Gerald and South Carolina go ahead you're on
[1:23:55.840 --> 1:23:59.400]  the air trying to move quicker hey Alex welcome would like to say first off
[1:23:59.400 --> 1:24:03.720]  thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity wanted to
[1:24:03.720 --> 1:24:07.160]  warn people I've been trying to get a hold of you for a year okay I'm a double
[1:24:07.160 --> 1:24:13.440]  amputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that'll never go away living
[1:24:13.440 --> 1:24:18.240]  defense saved my life they had me on antibiotics for two years that almost
[1:24:18.240 --> 1:24:23.160]  killed me living defense brought me back I wanted to just quote from the Bible
[1:24:23.160 --> 1:24:29.080]  Jesus the same as to where we are right now this is Matthew 24 verse 9 then they
[1:24:29.080 --> 1:24:35.240]  shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated
[1:24:35.240 --> 1:24:40.520]  of all nations for my name's sake and then shall many be offended and shall
[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:44.520]  betray one another and shall hate one another that's right where we're at
[1:24:44.520 --> 1:24:48.400]  brother and that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter
[1:24:48.400 --> 1:24:52.280]  what they say and that's why the enemy hates it because God created this
[1:24:52.280 --> 1:25:01.280]  country your voice counts when you share information be it over the internet
[1:25:01.280 --> 1:25:05.960]  or in person it changes the world the globalists know their agenda is unpopular

[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:15.400]  bring in the great reset and it's just all coming out now just wide open it's
[1:28:15.400 --> 1:28:21.360]  everything we said all the conclusion re-reached it's like yeah you live in a
[1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:26.080]  corrupt world they would censor the people warning you about it do you get
[1:28:26.080 --> 1:28:34.520]  that and this audience of course gets it it's just it's just frustrating when
[1:28:34.520 --> 1:28:38.080]  you when you see the evil you know the game plan and you think okay here it is
[1:28:38.080 --> 1:28:41.560]  people want to know this and then stop it and it just keeps trucking right along
[1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:49.240]  man kind of like Biden and all of his gas so when he's not faking playing golf
[1:28:49.240 --> 1:28:54.360]  or then or then trying to play golf and hacking it around he's insulting our
[1:28:54.360 --> 1:29:00.400]  Coast Guard so this is a new clip of course there's already already old clips
[1:29:00.400 --> 1:29:06.400]  out there of Biden insulting members of the military calling them dumb
[1:29:06.400 --> 1:29:10.440]  bastards so we know about his lack of respect for Americans in the military
[1:29:10.440 --> 1:29:13.640]  here's the latest there I'm telling you I don't know how much longer they can let
[1:29:13.640 --> 1:29:17.520]  this guy speak at all but I guess for the rest of his administration perhaps
[1:29:17.520 --> 1:29:23.400]  here's Biden speaking to Coast Guard graduates calling them dull I can only
[1:29:23.400 --> 1:29:29.080]  assume that you will enjoy educating your family about how the Coast Guard is
[1:29:29.080 --> 1:29:37.120]  quote the hard nucleus around the Navy forms in times war you are why you're
[1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:44.680]  really dull class come on man is the son getting to you I would think you'd
[1:29:44.680 --> 1:29:48.360]  have an opportunity when I say that about the Navy to clap but be here
[1:29:48.360 --> 1:29:54.920]  together think about the condescension there guys guys play the b-roll again
[1:29:54.920 --> 1:29:58.480]  and pause it after he says that because you can see the condescending look in
[1:29:58.480 --> 1:30:03.640]  his eyes you can see the sneering look yeah like he really looks down on them
[1:30:03.640 --> 1:30:09.160]  he really looks down on them he really thinks they're a bunch of sad sacks a
[1:30:09.160 --> 1:30:13.280]  bunch of piles of crap that's what Joe Biden thinks about our military but but
[1:30:13.280 --> 1:30:16.440]  but I got news for you Joe it's not because the Coast Guard you were
[1:30:16.440 --> 1:30:23.360]  addressing is dull it's not because it's not their problem Joe it's you they
[1:30:23.360 --> 1:30:30.560]  don't like you you have no energy you suck you're a comedian that's not funny
[1:30:30.560 --> 1:30:39.040]  you're a leader that can't lead you're a sprinter without legs so yeah nobody's
[1:30:39.040 --> 1:30:44.600]  cheering there's no energy in the audience because of you you're not
[1:30:44.600 --> 1:30:53.480]  popular in fact you're unpopular but there you go add it to the list of
[1:30:53.480 --> 1:31:06.080]  Bidens insults to our military I just hate that these bastards lead us man
[1:31:08.080 --> 1:31:14.840]  now go figure you know what let me get into this other political news and I'll
[1:31:14.840 --> 1:31:18.200]  cover the vaccine news in the next segment before Roger Stone joins us it's
[1:31:18.200 --> 1:31:23.920]  just diabolical it's diabolical what they're doing to get people to take this
[1:31:23.920 --> 1:31:30.040]  vaccine one of the most underrated members of the Republican Party perhaps
[1:31:30.040 --> 1:31:34.280]  because he switched from Democrat and and he's a true America first or is
[1:31:34.280 --> 1:31:39.160]  Vernon Jones out of Georgia he's calling for a forensic audit of the
[1:31:39.160 --> 1:31:47.640]  presidential election in 2020 he's running for governor of Georgia and so
[1:31:47.640 --> 1:31:53.560]  this is just great we need to be lifting Vernon Jones up and obviously he's
[1:31:53.560 --> 1:31:56.960]  he's not going to be looking for any job in DC he's running for governor of
[1:31:56.960 --> 1:32:03.200]  Georgia to replace the corrupt lackadaisical pathetic camp but but
[1:32:03.200 --> 1:32:07.920]  Vernon Jones underrated I think star up and coming for for an American first
[1:32:07.920 --> 1:32:15.160]  political movement but so calling for a audit into the Georgia election you
[1:32:15.160 --> 1:32:19.760]  also have some other developing news here headline from the Gateway pundit
[1:32:19.760 --> 1:32:23.920]  Democrats and their accomplices are worried about the presidential election
[1:32:23.920 --> 1:32:28.040]  in Arizona but the Senate is on the line as well this is a great point overall
[1:32:28.040 --> 1:32:35.640]  not just for Arizona to make they didn't just steal the presidency they didn't
[1:32:35.640 --> 1:32:39.080]  just steal the White House the Democrats that is they didn't just steal it for
[1:32:39.080 --> 1:32:44.000]  Biden they stole it for two Democrats in the Georgia Senate election as well they
[1:32:44.000 --> 1:32:49.040]  stole it for a Democrat in the Arizona Senate election so they stole probably
[1:32:49.040 --> 1:32:53.520]  about four or five Senate seats as well and and and then who knows how many
[1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:57.920]  house seats that they stole but that's why this is so critical because we're
[1:32:57.920 --> 1:33:02.240]  all focused on the presidential election obviously but understanding that it's
[1:33:02.240 --> 1:33:06.800]  it's it's widespread election theft that happens they don't just steal the White
[1:33:06.800 --> 1:33:10.760]  House they steal house seats they steal Senate seats they got caught red-handed
[1:33:10.760 --> 1:33:17.280]  in Georgia stealing two Senate seats unbelievable sitting here having
[1:33:17.280 --> 1:33:24.200]  flashbacks from January in my mind where of course first we watched in
[1:33:24.200 --> 1:33:29.120]  November on election night we watched Trump leading all day in these states
[1:33:29.120 --> 1:33:33.320]  Trump winning the vote all day long in Pennsylvania in Michigan in Wisconsin in
[1:33:33.320 --> 1:33:39.360]  Georgia and then right at midnight magically millions of votes immediately
[1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:42.560]  pour in for Biden and then they declare him the winner and they stop counting
[1:33:42.560 --> 1:33:46.720]  well it just reminds me of January watching the runoff special elections in
[1:33:46.720 --> 1:33:50.240]  Georgia for the two Senate seats and the exact same thing happened the
[1:33:50.240 --> 1:33:54.720]  Republicans winning all night all day and then right at midnight right before
[1:33:54.720 --> 1:33:58.520]  they stopped counting magically the Democrats get right ahead just enough
[1:33:58.520 --> 1:34:07.120]  votes to win incredible the most obvious election cheat you've ever seen in your
[1:34:07.120 --> 1:34:15.760]  life I mean seriously like this country is a joke man this country's a joke these
[1:34:15.760 --> 1:34:22.800]  people are a joke but you know ultimately what it is ultimately you know
[1:34:22.800 --> 1:34:26.440]  what I mean this is this is real existential stuff but really ultimately
[1:34:26.440 --> 1:34:31.840]  what it is is that nobody wants to die and you say what what are you talking
[1:34:31.840 --> 1:34:36.360]  about well folks we know that if we really wanted to overturn this stuff we'd
[1:34:36.360 --> 1:34:39.640]  have to have a physical hot war
[1:34:40.320 --> 1:34:46.800]  anybody who sought this out has probably at some point reached that that
[1:34:46.800 --> 1:34:50.040]  conclusion doesn't even matter what side of the political spectrum you're on the
[1:34:50.040 --> 1:34:52.680]  left has already figured that out that's why they're burning cities to the
[1:34:52.680 --> 1:34:55.720]  ground that's why they're burning churches to the ground that's why they're
[1:34:55.720 --> 1:34:59.040]  attacking police officers because the left has figured that out too they're
[1:34:59.040 --> 1:35:03.240]  just actually actually implementing the violence and it's being promoted by the
[1:35:03.240 --> 1:35:06.200]  media promoted by the politicians so the people on the streets feel like
[1:35:06.200 --> 1:35:12.720]  they're in the right to do it but but historically speaking this type of
[1:35:12.720 --> 1:35:16.840]  evil this type of corruption has never been absolved peacefully never has
[1:35:16.840 --> 1:35:24.320]  happened so and that's thing and it's weird too because we have all these great
[1:35:24.320 --> 1:35:28.480]  members of the military and all these great veterans that signed up to go
[1:35:28.480 --> 1:35:32.720]  overseas and fight but because the military industrial complex aims them
[1:35:32.720 --> 1:35:37.560]  in certain directions we don't even use our own military to protect our own
[1:35:37.560 --> 1:35:44.000]  country anymore and so you have more evidence of voter fraud and election
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:48.920]  theft in Pennsylvania election officials in Pennsylvania blame coding error with
[1:35:48.920 --> 1:35:52.800]  Dominion voting machines for flaws with Republican votes in primary this week so
[1:35:52.800 --> 1:35:56.360]  so they just openly steal our elections they openly bring in medical tyranny
[1:35:56.360 --> 1:36:01.400]  they openly sabotage and collapse our economy they openly say that you the
[1:36:01.400 --> 1:36:06.120]  American Patriot are now a terrorist on the level with a 9-11 plane hijacker and
[1:36:06.120 --> 1:36:09.920]  we just sit here and take it because we've had it so good and we still got
[1:36:09.920 --> 1:36:14.800]  plenty of food and we can still start our cars some of us and we can still you
[1:36:14.800 --> 1:36:17.960]  know afford energy but this these are dwindlings but so that's that's what it
[1:36:17.960 --> 1:36:22.800]  is the reason why we haven't really overthrown this is because historically
[1:36:22.800 --> 1:36:26.760]  speaking it has to be done physically nobody wants to go to that level most
[1:36:26.760 --> 1:36:30.600]  people won't even be intellectually honest about any of this most people
[1:36:30.600 --> 1:36:36.040]  won't even be intellectually honest about any of this to to themselves or to
[1:36:36.040 --> 1:36:43.640]  their friends or to their audience but but that's why that's why this is such
[1:36:43.640 --> 1:36:48.200]  a paradox here everybody knows how corrupt Washington DC is everybody
[1:36:48.200 --> 1:36:51.920]  knows how criminal and bad it is but we got it so good here so we're not ready
[1:36:51.920 --> 1:36:55.560]  to lose everything yet I'm not gonna say this five times in a row to the
[1:36:55.560 --> 1:37:00.200]  national I'm saying it because it's the key to victory over these criminals last
[1:37:00.200 --> 1:37:06.880]  week the arch globalist Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top
[1:37:06.880 --> 1:37:11.560]  brass and workers medical doctors scientists nurses you name it have
[1:37:11.560 --> 1:37:16.480]  taken the so-called COVID-19 Franken shot I'm gonna say the second time around
[1:37:16.480 --> 1:37:24.360]  half of the doctors at the CDC and NIH refused to take the Franken shots they
[1:37:24.360 --> 1:37:28.440]  don't trust it you shouldn't trust it the vaccines have been banned in most
[1:37:28.440 --> 1:37:32.280]  countries around the world this is an attack on the American people the people
[1:37:32.280 --> 1:37:37.800]  the world this is an absolute red flag smoking gun again let me say it two more
[1:37:37.800 --> 1:37:43.240]  times around half the individuals that work at the NIH and CDC the medical
[1:37:43.240 --> 1:37:47.600]  staff refused to take the vaccines that's right the doctors nurses scientists do
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:50.960]  not trust a so-called vaccine and you shouldn't either they're used to
[1:37:50.960 --> 1:37:56.200]  want everyone you know about the proof your brain your heart your bones your
[1:37:56.200 --> 1:38:02.400]  liver your eyes everything has a better shot it's surviving in this crazy

[1:41:50.360 --> 1:41:55.640]  surge in vaccination shots after offering five million dollar vaccine
[1:41:55.640 --> 1:42:03.320]  lottery the vax a million lottery oh wow they have record signups and record
[1:42:03.320 --> 1:42:08.960]  vaccinations when you bribe people with a month with a money prize oh my gosh
[1:42:08.960 --> 1:42:12.800]  who saw that coming no that's exactly what they wanted that's exactly what
[1:42:12.800 --> 1:42:18.520]  they did and you look at the Ohio governor Mike DeWine a Republican in name
[1:42:18.520 --> 1:42:25.000]  only I would I would guess a a compromised politician I mean you take
[1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:28.720]  one look at the guy folks there's no way this guy wins anything legitimately and
[1:42:28.720 --> 1:42:33.760]  nobody in Ohio likes him and he's been all about the COVID tyranny but but he's
[1:42:33.760 --> 1:42:37.800]  there as the governor and so he did the vax a million lottery and now they are
[1:42:37.800 --> 1:42:42.640]  poisoning the people of Ohio making the people of Ohio guinea pigs hey guinea
[1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:49.000]  pigs of Ohio I know this vaccine is deadly but we need you to be a part of

[1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:06.360]  he belongs in prison for this disgusting why well because of all the side
[1:43:06.360 --> 1:43:11.880]  effects of course and the death from the vaccines Canadian man loses over six
[1:43:11.880 --> 1:43:18.920]  feet of intestine after blood clot caused by COVID vaccine
[1:43:18.920 --> 1:43:26.120]  mm-hmm and of course this individual was a little skeptical of the vaccines
[1:43:26.120 --> 1:43:30.760]  going in he knew about the blood clots but he was told it's so rare don't even
[1:43:30.760 --> 1:43:39.440]  worry about it so rare until it happens to you and there you go
[1:43:39.440 --> 1:43:48.160]  mm-hmm but hey if you were in Ohio you could have been entered into the lottery
[1:43:48.160 --> 1:43:53.800]  six feet of your intestines a small price to pay to almost win the lottery you
[1:43:53.800 --> 1:44:03.640]  would you wouldn't win anyway so I'm gonna add this to my book of vaccine
[1:44:03.640 --> 1:44:10.560]  side effects I'm another folder bursting at the seams just add it to the
[1:44:10.560 --> 1:44:15.680]  list these people are sick promoting these vaccines and telling you it's safe
[1:44:15.680 --> 1:44:21.640]  and effective when it's not it's neither safe nor effective ladies and gentlemen
[1:44:21.640 --> 1:44:29.120]  and people know this and that's why you had British soldiers refusing the
[1:44:29.120 --> 1:44:35.920]  COVID-19 vaccine British soldiers who refuse COVID jab will be educated oh
[1:44:35.920 --> 1:44:42.720]  and could face disciplinary action ah the reeducation camps are coming the
[1:44:42.720 --> 1:44:48.600]  gulags are coming you don't want to subscribe to medical tyranny you'll be
[1:44:48.600 --> 1:45:00.000]  sent to the reeducation camp just like in China so much for the free world so
[1:45:00.000 --> 1:45:04.960]  much for my body my choice so much for informed medical consent it's all out
[1:45:04.960 --> 1:45:12.920]  the door when tyranny comes and it's here but but you know us Americans don't
[1:45:12.920 --> 1:45:17.840]  really like tyranny so they have to find a way to lure us into tyranny with free
[1:45:17.840 --> 1:45:25.640]  donuts and free beers and free fries and lotteries be a part of this eugenics
[1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:31.760]  experiment America's like no no they're like but we have a Krispy Kreme donut
[1:45:31.760 --> 1:45:38.360]  for you mmm a Krispy Kreme donut huh we've got a vaccine lottery you could
[1:45:38.360 --> 1:45:43.560]  win a million dollars really I could do a lot with a million dollars okay I'll be
[1:45:43.560 --> 1:45:51.360]  part of you eugenics program I'll give it a go and then they do it and then they
[1:45:51.360 --> 1:46:03.280]  have massive side effects and then the media covers it up what a sick planet we
[1:46:03.280 --> 1:46:11.840]  live on man what a sick satanic planet we are experiencing right now let's just
[1:46:11.840 --> 1:46:17.200]  move on here Rob Schneider you've got to like Rob Schneider not just for his
[1:46:17.200 --> 1:46:24.160]  funny movies but but the realist the his realism and politics I mean I'm pretty
[1:46:24.160 --> 1:46:27.480]  sure he's a liberal but but he just he has common sense approaches to the
[1:46:27.480 --> 1:46:32.840]  modern-day political issues so so you can you you resonate with him but he puts
[1:46:32.840 --> 1:46:36.160]  the picture of all the NIH funded gain-of-function scientists and he says
[1:46:36.160 --> 1:46:40.600]  of course government just happens to admit aliens exist so we can all forget
[1:46:40.600 --> 1:46:46.040]  about these guys yeah the guys that sold or gave the bio-weapon to China that
[1:46:46.040 --> 1:46:49.600]  then was used against us yeah those guys yeah committing treason against us yeah
[1:46:49.600 --> 1:46:53.760]  those guys yeah it should be arrested yeah investigated yeah but you won't
[1:46:53.760 --> 1:46:56.920]  you'll be investigated if you waved an American flag on DC on the 6th because
[1:46:56.920 --> 1:47:00.240]  you're the real criminal not the ones that made a bio-weapon and gave it to
[1:47:00.240 --> 1:47:08.600]  China no no no I'm sorry man I guess it's gallows here I mean it's just so
[1:47:08.600 --> 1:47:16.800]  ridiculous but you know this whole alien thing you got to say it's it's it's an
[1:47:16.800 --> 1:47:24.480]  odd thing that you have or UFOs more more accurately stated you have government
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:30.200]  admitting UFOs showing the tapes military admitting they're stalking our
[1:47:30.200 --> 1:47:36.560]  bases and it's like not even news how is I mean seriously how is that even
[1:47:36.560 --> 1:47:42.440]  possible and I mean we're not making a big deal of it I don't I'm not I'm not
[1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:45.880]  even saying I necessarily trust all this stuff we get lied to from our
[1:47:45.880 --> 1:47:49.880]  government all the time we know about the project blue bleep blue beam fake
[1:47:49.880 --> 1:47:54.240]  alien invasion so are they trying to build that up is there something else
[1:47:54.240 --> 1:48:00.760]  going on but isn't it odd I mean seriously that that is something US
[1:48:00.760 --> 1:48:06.640]  government admits UFOs releases the videos and it barely has a blip on the
[1:48:06.640 --> 1:48:11.560]  radar flying objects doing things that no human knows of technology that we
[1:48:11.560 --> 1:48:22.480]  that we have and they're always stalking our military bases barely even news
[1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:30.520]  barely even a blip on the radar that's odd now again I've seen this whole thing
[1:48:30.520 --> 1:48:40.240]  of it they're using it as a distraction or oh just you know whatever but either
[1:48:40.240 --> 1:48:45.320]  way it's still all out there and it's barely being talked about and and
[1:48:45.320 --> 1:48:50.840]  remember that Dan Radcliffe a year ago or even more went on mornings with Maria
[1:48:50.840 --> 1:48:56.800]  Maria Bartiromo and said that he wanted to classify this stuff with Trump in
[1:48:56.800 --> 1:49:02.760]  office he went on Fox News and said we have proof and videos and know of UFOs
[1:49:02.760 --> 1:49:07.480]  stalking our military bases we have all that we have everything and he wanted to
[1:49:07.480 --> 1:49:13.600]  declassify them then with Trump and he was rejected by the Pentagon mmm but now
[1:49:13.600 --> 1:49:16.600]  they want to release it now they want to show you all the videos now that Biden
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:23.400]  is in but yet still it's not a big news story so it's a very weird it's a very
[1:49:23.400 --> 1:49:29.040]  weird thing there New York State Troopers raid Democrat mayors home in
[1:49:29.040 --> 1:49:33.760]  Rochester New York police announced it's a criminal investigation into Rochester
[1:49:33.760 --> 1:49:39.000]  Mayor lovely Warren you won't hear a mention of this anywhere on the news but
[1:49:39.000 --> 1:49:44.800]  if it was Republican it'd be the leading story you know maybe there's a reason
[1:49:44.800 --> 1:49:48.560]  why the White House is so ineffective and fractured because Kamala Harris and
[1:49:48.560 --> 1:49:52.120]  Joe Biden have to pretend like they like one another when we both know that they
[1:49:52.120 --> 1:49:57.080]  probably don't this story was on the Gateway pundit today just a little
[1:49:57.080 --> 1:50:02.440]  blast from the past Jill Biden to Kamala Harris after 2019 presidential debate
[1:50:02.440 --> 1:50:09.600]  go f yourself because remember because remember Democrats during that
[1:50:09.600 --> 1:50:16.120]  presidential debate were echoing the claims of Tara Reid remember that the
[1:50:16.120 --> 1:50:19.520]  me too movement Tara Reid accusing Joe Biden of sexual harassment remember all
[1:50:19.520 --> 1:50:23.800]  that the Democrats brought that up during the presidential debate Jill Biden
[1:50:23.800 --> 1:50:29.600]  didn't like that Kamala Harris brought up the racist past of Joe Biden he didn't
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:33.000]  want his kids to grow up in a racial jungle you know going to school with
[1:50:33.000 --> 1:50:36.080]  black kids Joe Biden didn't want his kids in schools with black kids because he's
[1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:48.680]  a racist Joe Biden eulogizing KKK grand dragon Cyclops is what's the guy's name
[1:50:48.680 --> 1:50:58.680]  bird Robert bird and of course Joe Biden was in office and voted for
[1:50:58.680 --> 1:51:03.760]  segregation bills that Kamala Harris claimed kept her off of the bus from
[1:51:03.760 --> 1:51:07.120]  going to school now that all came out to be a lie to everything Kamala Harris
[1:51:07.120 --> 1:51:12.160]  says is a lie but the Democrats during the presidential debates had concluded
[1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:18.960]  that Joe Biden was a womanizer and a racist now they voted him into office and
[1:51:18.960 --> 1:51:22.520]  I guess Kamala Harris was just told hey look get along with Joe play the role
[1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:26.800]  pretend you like him you know he's slipping you know he's we'll just slip
[1:51:26.800 --> 1:51:32.320]  him out of there and we'll put you in this country is so corrupt man we we
[1:51:32.320 --> 1:51:37.120]  need prayers we need a miracle we need God's intervention we need Jesus Christ
[1:51:37.120 --> 1:51:43.600]  as we are going down a slippery slope of tyranny and it's very scary globalist
[1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:48.960]  puppet Joe Biden wasted no time blaming Russia with no evidence for the
[1:51:48.960 --> 1:51:53.600]  shutdown of the East Coast gasoline pipeline that goes from Houston right up
[1:51:53.600 --> 1:51:57.080]  through New York City and supplies more than half of the gasoline to the East
[1:51:57.080 --> 1:52:01.800]  Coast but who is it that actually shut down the main pipeline from Canada to
[1:52:01.800 --> 1:52:06.480]  the Midwest to Houston to refine the oil that's then turned into gas and said
[1:52:06.480 --> 1:52:11.160]  the East Coast that's right Joe Biden shut down the keystone pipeline right
[1:52:11.160 --> 1:52:16.400]  after it was completed Joe Biden did that to America he has the history he has
[1:52:16.400 --> 1:52:20.800]  the background he's one that promised to quote get us off of fossil fuels he's the
[1:52:20.800 --> 1:52:25.560]  one that's tried to extend the lockdowns of the country remember ladies and
[1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:29.520]  gentlemen but the new world order once a post industrial world and they want the
[1:52:29.520 --> 1:52:33.720]  United States Europe and Australia crippled so communist China can be
[1:52:33.720 --> 1:52:37.720]  dominant it's not Russia that's the enemy it's communist China and their
[1:52:37.720 --> 1:52:41.920]  millions like Joe Biden in control the White House that's the facts that's the
[1:52:41.920 --> 1:52:46.640]  information when listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done I

[1:53:20.320 --> 1:53:24.280]  more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're

[1:54:00.200 --> 1:54:06.200]  they are all but openly admitting that the vaccines are neither safe or
[1:54:06.200 --> 1:54:11.000]  effective but they still want you to take them because that's what Tierney
[1:54:11.000 --> 1:54:15.760]  looks like that's what medical Tierney feels like and so here's Nancy Pelosi
[1:54:15.760 --> 1:54:21.600]  admitting that the vaccines don't work complaining that people aren't wearing
[1:54:21.600 --> 1:54:25.640]  masks or are pushing back against her mask mandate in the halls of Congress
[1:54:25.640 --> 1:54:42.600]  here's the drunken fool admitting that vaccines don't work
[1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:58.440]  because they are selfishly a danger to other people including staff people
[1:54:58.440 --> 1:55:04.920]  here so while we all hopeful and I joined the president being hopeful that we
[1:55:04.920 --> 1:55:11.960]  can reach a place where it is safe for people to be what is the honor system
[1:55:11.960 --> 1:55:17.400]  the honor system as to whether somebody's been vaccinated she doesn't
[1:55:17.400 --> 1:55:24.040]  trust them breathing in the face of their fellow humans so let me let's just
[1:55:24.040 --> 1:55:27.720]  see because she's a demon I can't take her anymore I'll just insult her the
[1:55:27.720 --> 1:55:36.200]  whole time that's a demon though but but let me just try to look at that I'm
[1:55:36.200 --> 1:55:41.280]  sorry I just you see that woman and you just know evil you just see evil you
[1:55:41.280 --> 1:55:48.160]  just just makes it it makes your body just the man you know that's just a
[1:55:48.160 --> 1:55:52.080]  response I'm sorry I just can't help it folks I mean my body literally cringes
[1:55:52.080 --> 1:55:57.760]  and tingles when I see that evil but so there she is saying that oh I'm keeping
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:01.160]  the mask mandate for Congress because we don't know if everyone's been
[1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:06.680]  vaccinated but again you're admitting the vaccine doesn't work if you've been
[1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:11.720]  vaccinated what are you scared of if you've been vaccinated you shouldn't be
[1:56:11.720 --> 1:56:18.360]  at risk right of course that's wrong the vaccine isn't effective neither is it
[1:56:18.360 --> 1:56:23.600]  safe so Republicans don't want to take it and by the way Republicans like Ron
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:27.000]  Johnson are actually really smart on this issue and he's he's going on TV and
[1:56:27.000 --> 1:56:34.120]  explain he's like look I'm not anti-vax but I've had COVID and the science shows
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:38.920]  the studies show that if you have COVID if you've had COVID and get the vaccine
[1:56:38.920 --> 1:56:44.120]  that it's even more dangerous for you so he's not gonna get the vaccine and he
[1:56:44.120 --> 1:56:46.840]  shouldn't be forced to get the vaccine and he shouldn't be forced to wear a
[1:56:46.840 --> 1:56:53.920]  mask except Nancy Pelosi likes tyranny except Nancy Pelosi's a demon but again
[1:56:53.920 --> 1:56:58.400]  she's vaccinated all if all the Democrats are vaccinated then what are
[1:56:58.400 --> 1:57:04.080]  they so afraid of they're admitting the vaccine doesn't work they're telling you
[1:57:04.080 --> 1:57:09.960]  it doesn't work seriously I mean this is unbelievable that info wars or that I
[1:57:09.960 --> 1:57:14.640]  have to explain this to you because other people won't it's just it's just
[1:57:14.640 --> 1:57:18.480]  unbelievable man now let me let me get to this other news before Roger Stone
[1:57:18.480 --> 1:57:22.760]  joins us we also know that the Democrats and liberals are extremely racist and
[1:57:22.760 --> 1:57:27.040]  they want to teach you to be racist too in Virginia little league coaches
[1:57:27.040 --> 1:57:31.560]  forced to cancel practice and attend critical race-themed workshop instead
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:35.680]  now so to make the coaches racist make the kids racist kind of like this coach
[1:57:35.680 --> 1:57:41.120]  at a private university in Detroit players and parents complain about
[1:57:41.120 --> 1:57:46.680]  Detroit Mercy Girls basketball coach university keeps the coach all 14
[1:57:46.680 --> 1:57:52.080]  players quit so you have a radical leftist basketball coach who wants them
[1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:56.300]  to knee for the anthem and wants to have black lives matter ceremonies and the
[1:57:56.300 --> 1:58:00.240]  team just wants to play basketball by the way they were 1 and 13 under this
[1:58:00.240 --> 1:58:05.440]  coach 1 and 13 so the kids are like we're not winning games we don't like the
[1:58:05.440 --> 1:58:11.440]  coach she's more she's more focused on her politics than basketball and they
[1:58:11.440 --> 1:58:15.200]  and the parents all complain there's an investigation wants the players all
[1:58:15.200 --> 1:58:18.280]  complain the university says oh we can't fire her she's a black woman that
[1:58:18.280 --> 1:58:21.520]  wears a black lives matter shirt we'd be called racist so they keep the coach
[1:58:21.520 --> 1:58:28.200]  and the entire team quits that's incredible and now you have Laurie
[1:58:28.200 --> 1:58:34.680]  Lightfoot Laurie Laurie Lightfoot Laurie Smallhead Laurie Laurie Laurie

[2:00:31.280 --> 2:00:36.400]  all his businesses all for political purposes everybody knows Trump hasn't
[2:00:36.400 --> 2:00:39.400]  done anything illegal but the Democrats still want to destroy him and they want
[2:00:39.400 --> 2:00:43.200]  to destroy Roger too so he's familiar with that of course us here at Info Wars
[2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:47.400]  are too but Roger I want to start by coming on and and and commending you
[2:00:47.400 --> 2:00:53.680]  and and flashing back a couple years I believe it was probably two or three
[2:00:53.680 --> 2:00:58.080]  years ago even Roger when you were still co-hosting the war room with me where
[2:00:58.080 --> 2:01:03.800]  we were talking about the NFL and its racist treatment of its former players
[2:01:03.800 --> 2:01:08.280]  dealing with the concussions dealing with a lot of problems after playing in
[2:01:08.280 --> 2:01:11.840]  the NFL head trauma and all the things they went through and the NFL just
[2:01:11.840 --> 2:01:16.040]  basically giving them the bird not paying out the treatment not paying out
[2:01:16.040 --> 2:01:20.000]  what they promised they would pay out and most of these athletes were black
[2:01:20.000 --> 2:01:24.520]  and now it comes out that the NFL is saying black people are dumber so they
[2:01:24.520 --> 2:01:28.760]  don't get financial compensation this is incredible so Roger what we broke on
[2:01:28.760 --> 2:01:34.400]  the war room here on Info Wars years ago is now mainstream news no that's
[2:01:34.400 --> 2:01:39.280]  exactly right oh and first of all I'm happy to jump in here and help pinch
[2:01:39.280 --> 2:01:44.160]  it with you for the great Alex Jones but you're absolutely right people need
[2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:49.800]  to understand that there is an NFL scandal it's not kneeling it's the fact
[2:01:49.800 --> 2:01:55.880]  that the NFL making record profits reached an agreement a legal settlement
[2:01:55.880 --> 2:02:02.320]  with some of its veteran players a class of players which is 88% African
[2:02:02.320 --> 2:02:08.280]  American to pay them up to 360 million dollars for their legal expenses
[2:02:08.280 --> 2:02:13.080]  apartment for their medical expenses we're talking about hall of famers like
[2:02:13.080 --> 2:02:17.680]  Cornell Webster we're talking about people who really made this game great
[2:02:17.680 --> 2:02:22.840]  and what's happened of course is that those administering the settlement those
[2:02:22.840 --> 2:02:30.800]  lawyers they've made millions literally millions yet black families who
[2:02:30.800 --> 2:02:35.800]  connected to these players are literally being starved out because you see
[2:02:35.800 --> 2:02:41.640]  under the settlement if a veteran NFL player passes away his family is
[2:02:41.640 --> 2:02:48.400]  entitled to nothing so they stall you're supposed to apply to the program oh
[2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:54.280]  we spit back your application you forgot a comma on the second paragraph of the
[2:02:54.280 --> 2:03:00.160]  third question you know Roger Goodell should be ashamed of himself these these
[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:07.080]  men made this sport what it is today and they are being denied medical treatment
[2:03:07.080 --> 2:03:12.840]  they're being denied compensation I know of one particular instance where a very
[2:03:12.840 --> 2:03:18.500]  famous Hall of Famer is delivering pizzas to try to make ends meet for his
[2:03:18.500 --> 2:03:24.880]  family Roger Goodell should be ashamed of himself yeah and it's really for so
[2:03:24.880 --> 2:03:29.520]  many different reasons and it's sad too that you don't have the current athletes
[2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:33.840]  really speaking out or talking about this again mostly black American football
[2:03:33.840 --> 2:03:37.280]  players that are in this league they could be subject to this in the future
[2:03:37.280 --> 2:03:42.080]  my guess is Roger Goodell puts a tight clamp on their ability to speak out on
[2:03:42.080 --> 2:03:46.760]  these issues but how amazing is it that it may have even been worse than we were
[2:03:46.760 --> 2:03:52.520]  talking about at the time that the NFL's excuse now for not paying out these
[2:03:52.520 --> 2:03:56.960]  medical bills is because they're saying oh well these athletes have a low
[2:03:56.960 --> 2:04:01.320]  cognitive ability black athletes they're saying have a low cognitive ability so
[2:04:01.320 --> 2:04:05.560]  we don't have to pay them out I mean how I mean is that racist where's their
[2:04:05.560 --> 2:04:10.600]  scientific evidence for that I mean where do they get that no and to compound
[2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:16.520]  that is the fact that in many cases the doctors representing the NFL actually
[2:04:16.520 --> 2:04:21.160]  tried to claim that those players who are making the claims are faking it
[2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:24.960]  they're not really ill they're not really brain damaged they're not they
[2:04:24.960 --> 2:04:30.040]  have no damage from their play this is one of the greatest outrages going on
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:36.720]  and I have beseeched President Trump and Donald Trump Jr. to tweet about this when
[2:04:36.720 --> 2:04:41.360]  they were on Twitter to talk about it because this is the real NFL scandal
[2:04:41.360 --> 2:04:46.680]  forget kneeling this is the real scandal and if you go to that daily
[2:04:46.680 --> 2:04:53.720]  caller I wrote two very extensive pieces on this subject and then I was
[2:04:53.720 --> 2:04:59.680]  accused of being a stooge for the lawyers representing those African American
[2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:05.160]  players who are not being taken care of as per a settlement that they all signed
[2:05:05.160 --> 2:05:11.840]  on to and agreed to let's be very clear I've taken not a dime not a penny I
[2:05:11.840 --> 2:05:17.160]  advocate on this issue because I care about it I advocate for it because I
[2:05:17.160 --> 2:05:21.640]  happened through my wife's church group to meet a wife of one of these injured
[2:05:21.640 --> 2:05:27.400]  players otherwise I wouldn't even know about this so you know I salute you oh
[2:05:27.400 --> 2:05:33.040]  and for bringing this back up we need to remind people of the of the outrageous
[2:05:33.040 --> 2:05:38.120]  conduct of the NFL the outrageous conduct of the federal judge in the
[2:05:38.120 --> 2:05:43.400]  settlement case who frankly I believe is senile who I think is suffering from
[2:05:43.400 --> 2:05:49.440]  Alzheimer's and the outrageous amount I think as much as 60 million paid to the
[2:05:49.440 --> 2:05:55.200]  lawyers who administer this whose job it is to reject every claim on some
[2:05:55.200 --> 2:06:00.160]  technicality it is an outrage well and think about it too because we're not I
[2:06:00.160 --> 2:06:02.880]  mean we're not the people that like to just come on here and beat the drum of
[2:06:02.880 --> 2:06:06.480]  calling something racist in fact we don't do that at all but when you see
[2:06:06.480 --> 2:06:12.200]  actual racism you call it out what does it tell you that the liberal media and
[2:06:12.200 --> 2:06:16.360]  the left that sees racism around every corner if they see something painted on
[2:06:16.360 --> 2:06:20.240]  the sidewalk that they think looks funny they call it racist but they won't talk
[2:06:20.240 --> 2:06:23.880]  about this I mean doesn't that just show you that there's to me that means
[2:06:23.880 --> 2:06:26.760]  there's been some sort of agreement with the media in the NFL and Roger Goodell
[2:06:26.760 --> 2:06:32.100]  like hey look have your players take any do the Black Lives Matter stuff and we
[2:06:32.100 --> 2:06:36.480]  won't call you out on this this racist policy of paying out former athletes
[2:06:36.480 --> 2:06:43.480]  medical bills well not only that but where is the ESPN where where are where
[2:06:43.480 --> 2:06:48.080]  are all the sports programming on the three national networks why is there no
[2:06:48.080 --> 2:06:51.840]  discussion of this I think if you're looking for ESPN you may want to check
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:58.520]  LeBron James Jock Roger I'd rather not go there if you don't mind you may not
[2:06:58.520 --> 2:07:04.120]  find ESPN but but the real problem here is that there's a media blackout let me
[2:07:04.120 --> 2:07:09.440]  let me reach out let me call out to those in Black Lives Matter where are you
[2:07:09.440 --> 2:07:15.480]  because the Black Lives of veteran NFL players matter just as much as any other
[2:07:15.480 --> 2:07:20.840]  Black life or any other life period but the Black Lives Matter movement has been
[2:07:20.840 --> 2:07:26.560]  silent on this issue absolutely silent I'm gonna write another column about this
[2:07:26.560 --> 2:07:32.320]  for Info Wars because it just makes my blood boil they keep calling us racist
[2:07:32.320 --> 2:07:38.680]  no they are the racists and the NFL policy on this is racist you know at the
[2:07:38.680 --> 2:07:44.880]  time that I was arrested in the phony Muller witch hunt and subjected to a
[2:07:44.880 --> 2:07:49.960]  Soviet style show trial I was preparing to do a giant demonstration outside
[2:07:49.960 --> 2:07:54.280]  Roger Goodell's apartment in New York and I think I would have had many many
[2:07:54.280 --> 2:07:59.640]  many African-Americans involved in that peaceful demonstration people need to
[2:07:59.640 --> 2:08:05.080]  know that this is happening people need to demand that the NFL live up to its
[2:08:05.080 --> 2:08:11.920]  legal responsibility they signed a 360 million dollar settlement and they have
[2:08:11.920 --> 2:08:17.760]  paid out less than 10% of those making claims it's a stalling action if they
[2:08:17.760 --> 2:08:21.840]  stall long enough these black players will pass away and their families will
[2:08:21.840 --> 2:08:26.200]  get nothing and now they denigrate them they say though they can't be brain
[2:08:26.200 --> 2:08:30.560]  damaged because they weren't smart to begin with that's racist that's
[2:08:30.560 --> 2:08:36.240]  outrageous and it really just shows how how messed up the leadership at the NFL
[2:08:36.240 --> 2:08:40.760]  is too because I mean I'm quite frankly of the opinion that they should have come
[2:08:40.760 --> 2:08:45.440]  out and just said look you're playing football it's a dangerous sport we're
[2:08:45.440 --> 2:08:48.160]  sorry you know now we know about this but there's nothing we can do about it
[2:08:48.160 --> 2:08:51.760]  now but they wanted to have their cake cake and eat it too so they wanted to
[2:08:51.760 --> 2:08:56.320]  hide the dangers of playing NFL football make these payouts they made the
[2:08:56.320 --> 2:09:00.200]  agreement they're not making the payouts and they're not being honest about how
[2:09:00.200 --> 2:09:03.560]  dangerous it is I mean so it's like it's just on all levels they're covering it
[2:09:03.560 --> 2:09:08.600]  up and the worst part is they they are active they have the active collusion of
[2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:12.480]  a federal judge the judges responsibilities to make sure that the
[2:09:12.480 --> 2:09:17.000]  settlement that she approved is actually enacted upon that it is carried out
[2:09:17.000 --> 2:09:22.280]  yet all she's really done is front for the lawyers whose job is to make sure
[2:09:22.280 --> 2:09:27.360]  the NFL pays no one I'm really glad you brought this up it really deserves to be
[2:09:27.360 --> 2:09:32.400]  aired I want to come back and talk about it more on the war room maybe some time
[2:09:32.400 --> 2:09:38.360]  next week but oh and you're a good man for bringing this up because this is the
[2:09:38.360 --> 2:09:43.320]  kind of systematic racism that we do need to deal with and maybe we can apply
[2:09:43.320 --> 2:09:48.920]  some pressure to the mainstream leftist media that they might pick the story up
[2:09:48.920 --> 2:09:56.000]  to I'm a very humble person but I'm also a bold person and so as bad as things are
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:09:59.040]  with the globalist attacking humanity of all the terrible things that are
[2:09:59.040 --> 2:10:03.440]  unfolding I want you to know a lot of positive things are happening as well
[2:10:03.440 --> 2:10:07.720]  I'm a public figure so I get to see things the Republic doesn't get to see
[2:10:07.720 --> 2:10:12.480]  it let me tell you whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even
[2:10:12.480 --> 2:10:18.120]  folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry people are really really
[2:10:18.120 --> 2:10:22.240]  away from the establishment they don't want to go along with the globalist but
[2:10:22.240 --> 2:10:26.160]  they're scared they're looking for leadership well that's where m4 comes
[2:10:26.160 --> 2:10:31.600]  in you fund us you support m4.com you get rate policy at the same time we will
[2:10:31.600 --> 2:10:35.960]  then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular but the globalist will
[2:10:35.960 --> 2:10:40.200]  target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the
[2:10:40.200 --> 2:10:46.240]  heat that's our job so please keep us on air so we can hit the bar wire so we
[2:10:46.240 --> 2:10:48.400]  can be the shock groups and the information war
[2:10:48.400 --> 2:10:54.440]  fund us at m4store.com one of the most common questions I get on air but also
[2:10:54.440 --> 2:10:59.760]  off air when I'm just out and about is Alex what do I say to my family about
[2:10:59.760 --> 2:11:04.840]  the vaccines how do I warn them well the problem is there's so many problems
[2:11:04.840 --> 2:11:08.520]  with it so many facts the history of contaminated vaccines the fact that they
[2:11:08.520 --> 2:11:12.640]  have liability protection in the US and Europe the fact that they've been caught
[2:11:12.640 --> 2:11:16.720]  adding sterilants and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines and the whole
[2:11:16.720 --> 2:11:21.280]  history of secret experimentation on at-risk groups of poor blacks poor whites
[2:11:21.280 --> 2:11:25.960]  Native Americans the list goes on and on but what about the fact that Fauci
[2:11:25.960 --> 2:11:31.960]  testified to Congress and so did the head of the CDC in late May of 2021 that
[2:11:31.960 --> 2:11:37.640]  around half of the NIH CDC staff medical doctors or all just scientists have
[2:11:37.640 --> 2:11:41.080]  refused to take the vaccine until they can say yeah I think what half of the
[2:11:41.080 --> 2:11:44.800]  doctors are scared to take it that's the same thing in the private practices
[2:11:44.800 --> 2:11:47.520]  out there somewhere numbers that that's not something I'm gonna be taking that's
[2:11:47.520 --> 2:11:51.520]  very very simple there's your answer
[2:11:51.520 --> 2:12:00.520]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:12:00.520 --> 2:12:22.680]  we've got Roger Stone ladies and gentlemen he's with me here for another
[2:12:22.680 --> 2:12:31.560]  segment and you know you saw what the criminal deep state did to Roger you
[2:12:31.560 --> 2:12:35.880]  see what they're doing to Trump this is what they do to real freedom fighters
[2:12:35.880 --> 2:12:41.200]  folks this is what tyrants do to freedom fighters and so I don't know Roger if
[2:12:41.200 --> 2:12:45.760]  you've seen the latest but obviously the Democrats are still continuing to go
[2:12:45.760 --> 2:12:50.600]  after Trump specifically in New York and they're now saying it's a criminal
[2:12:50.600 --> 2:12:55.760]  investigation into Trump and the Trump Organization of course this is all just
[2:12:55.760 --> 2:12:59.640]  what I think they're doing Roger is they're creating a situation so that
[2:12:59.640 --> 2:13:03.800]  Trump can never run again and I think they want to do a similar thing with
[2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:09.160]  this January 6 Commission and they want to make it so certain Republicans can
[2:13:09.160 --> 2:13:13.240]  never run again either and so this whole thing is about chilling free speech
[2:13:13.240 --> 2:13:18.200]  chilling any opposition to their political regime what is your take on
[2:13:18.200 --> 2:13:22.760]  their latest developments in their lust for power and their silencing of the
[2:13:22.760 --> 2:13:28.520]  political opposition that is the Democrat Party well Owen as the Bible tells us
[2:13:28.520 --> 2:13:34.600]  you reap what you sow this is an outrage first of all the district attorney for
[2:13:34.600 --> 2:13:39.920]  Manhattan is an elected partisan Democrat Cyrus Vance junior you may
[2:13:39.920 --> 2:13:44.520]  remember his father Cyrus Vance senior he was Secretary of State under Jimmy
[2:13:44.520 --> 2:13:50.080]  Carter he's the guy who botched the Iranian hostage crisis so this runs in
[2:13:50.080 --> 2:13:57.240]  the family the Attorney General Latisha James I don't recall her last name at
[2:13:57.240 --> 2:14:02.840]  the moment Latisha James yes Latisha James who ran for Attorney General of
[2:14:02.840 --> 2:14:07.640]  New York on a one-plank platform elect me and I will send Donald Trump to jail
[2:14:07.640 --> 2:14:14.040]  these are corrupt Democrats in the most corrupt state in the United States and
[2:14:14.040 --> 2:14:19.440]  I find it outrageous that they actually were allowed to legally get access to
[2:14:19.440 --> 2:14:23.560]  30 years worth of Donald Trump's business and banking records so they
[2:14:23.560 --> 2:14:28.000]  could search for a crime in other words they had no probable cause they had no
[2:14:28.000 --> 2:14:33.280]  evidence of any crime they're going out to try to fabricate one so they can
[2:14:33.280 --> 2:14:37.440]  embarrass the president of the United States this is the woman who should be
[2:14:37.440 --> 2:14:42.640]  removed from public office not Donald not Donald Trump what they really fear I
[2:14:42.640 --> 2:14:46.400]  think is very clear as you know yesterday it was announced that the
[2:14:46.400 --> 2:14:50.320]  president is going to hit the road to start doing the MAGA rallies again two
[2:14:50.320 --> 2:14:55.200]  scheduled for June one scheduled for early July this is the last thing Joe
[2:14:55.200 --> 2:14:59.440]  Biden wants because the single most effective critic of the current record
[2:14:59.440 --> 2:15:04.360]  of the Biden administration is Donald Trump so they want to cripple him and
[2:15:04.360 --> 2:15:08.800]  they want to make sure that he can't possibly run in 2024 because God knows
[2:15:08.800 --> 2:15:13.480]  if we have an honest election he might win in fact I think he'd probably win
[2:15:13.480 --> 2:15:18.840]  just like I think he won the last election so this is politically motivated
[2:15:18.840 --> 2:15:25.040]  it is entirely partisan we need to begin investigating those people I know of
[2:15:25.040 --> 2:15:29.880]  corruption by Cyprus Vance I know of extensive corruption by it but you're
[2:15:29.880 --> 2:15:35.000]  never going to have him prosecuted in the New York system so I think you put
[2:15:35.000 --> 2:15:38.840]  your finger on it this is to try to stigmatize Trump and make him less
[2:15:38.840 --> 2:15:43.280]  effective when he hits the road in June and starts kidney punching Joe Biden
[2:15:43.280 --> 2:15:51.200]  over take your pit the price of gasoline the the the price of all food goods the
[2:15:51.200 --> 2:15:55.840]  fact that around the globe whether it's in the Middle East or whether it's the
[2:15:55.840 --> 2:16:01.040]  Russians masked on the border of Ukraine preparing to take Crimea or whether it is
[2:16:01.040 --> 2:16:05.400]  the Chinese threatening our vessels in that part of the world as well as Taiwan
[2:16:05.400 --> 2:16:11.760]  they sense weakness in Joe Biden they know that he's not all there they know
[2:16:11.760 --> 2:16:15.120]  that he'll do nothing and therefore they're prepared to provoke us around
[2:16:15.120 --> 2:16:19.120]  the globe none of these things would have happened if Donald Trump were
[2:16:19.120 --> 2:16:23.600]  president because they know he was strong and he would broke no crap from our
[2:16:23.600 --> 2:16:29.000]  enemies abroad this is an attempt to kneecap him politically it is a
[2:16:29.000 --> 2:16:33.280]  complicated issue because he doesn't live in New York he doesn't have any
[2:16:33.280 --> 2:16:39.320]  businesses in New York but clearly based on today's media they're also targeting
[2:16:39.320 --> 2:16:45.240]  Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump this is just another
[2:16:45.240 --> 2:16:51.640]  witch hunt let's call it witch hunt for point oh meanwhile Hunter Biden a man
[2:16:51.640 --> 2:16:56.160]  who has very clearly taken millions of dollars in Ukraine
[2:16:56.160 --> 2:17:01.200]  millions of dollars in China millions of dollars in the United States just
[2:17:01.200 --> 2:17:06.920]  moved into a 4.5 million dollar house in the Hollywood Hills that Roger do you
[2:17:06.920 --> 2:17:12.000]  know any bedrooms that that new Hunter Biden house is I don't do you I think
[2:17:12.000 --> 2:17:16.680]  it's six bedrooms or so does Biden get like a half a bedroom or a bathroom I
[2:17:16.680 --> 2:17:20.280]  mean 10% for the big guy so I'm just trying to figure out what what part of
[2:17:20.280 --> 2:17:25.360]  that house Biden gets gee I thought maybe you were headed for to LA for a
[2:17:25.360 --> 2:17:29.680]  couple days you're just looking for a place to bunk you know well actually
[2:17:29.680 --> 2:17:35.080]  at Roger in Portland the Antifa whorehouse is open for business but but
[2:17:35.080 --> 2:17:41.320]  again there's overwhelming evidence that Hunter Biden had sex with underage
[2:17:41.320 --> 2:17:46.360]  girls there is no evidence or proof that Matt Gates did anything of the kind
[2:17:46.360 --> 2:17:52.200]  yet Matt Gates is being crucified and Hunter Biden is living the life of a
[2:17:52.200 --> 2:17:57.920]  pasha he's living like a king and once again the the two-tiered justice system
[2:17:57.920 --> 2:18:04.120]  that is that is completely dominant under Joe Biden and frankly was dominant
[2:18:04.120 --> 2:18:08.880]  under Donald Trump too because Barack Obama ran Donald Trump's Justice
[2:18:08.880 --> 2:18:13.880]  Department yeah incredible and had all of his stay behind network there as well
[2:18:13.880 --> 2:18:19.920]  and again if you had just a fraction of the investigation done into Joe Biden or
[2:18:19.920 --> 2:18:22.840]  Hunter Biden that's been done into Donald Trump when you would find so much
[2:18:22.840 --> 2:18:27.240]  crime and and quite frankly Roger it would it would it would it would it would
[2:18:27.240 --> 2:18:33.040]  be a like a domino effect the crimes that the Biden committed would just
[2:18:33.040 --> 2:18:35.920]  extend to the Clintons and then extend to the Obama's and I mean we could
[2:18:35.920 --> 2:18:39.800]  actually clean it up but I guess nobody has any interest in doing that they just
[2:18:39.800 --> 2:18:44.520]  want to go after orange man bad like they've been told but you're you're
[2:18:44.520 --> 2:18:48.640]  absolutely right look as I think many people know the Biden Justice Department
[2:18:48.640 --> 2:18:53.800]  has filed a civil suit against me seeking to collect what they say are two
[2:18:53.800 --> 2:18:59.240]  and a half million dollars in past due taxes penalties and interest now I had
[2:18:59.240 --> 2:19:03.640]  to stop making payments I made three years of ever escalating payments to pay
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:09.240]  my debt down I only stopped when they destroyed me financially at that moment
[2:19:09.240 --> 2:19:14.920]  legally they have the full authority to seize any asset I own now they're
[2:19:14.920 --> 2:19:19.160]  suing me you know what happens if they win the lawsuit they get the right to
[2:19:19.160 --> 2:19:24.240]  seize any asset I may have this is all public relations that this is all
[2:19:24.240 --> 2:19:28.560]  harassment you know I have another raid on your house I think Roger they got so
[2:19:28.560 --> 2:19:33.000]  much out of that it made their jollies tingle a little bit you know so they
[2:19:33.000 --> 2:19:37.360]  just love the optics of seeing that but I have to go back to the ramparts and
[2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:42.960]  fight again people want to help me can go to stonedefensefund.com I wanted to
[2:19:42.960 --> 2:19:47.880]  close this down I thought I was finished but no now I have to defend against a
[2:19:47.880 --> 2:19:53.680]  civil suit by the Biden Justice Department that is strictly harassment my
[2:19:53.680 --> 2:19:59.240]  lawyer my tax attorney ready to testify I never under reported a dime I never
[2:19:59.240 --> 2:20:04.080]  failed to report a dime but that they they want to keep me broke they want to
[2:20:04.080 --> 2:20:08.960]  destroy me but I will never fold and I will never stop fighting and I know in
[2:20:08.960 --> 2:20:13.640]  my heart God will protect me God will fight right alongside me God will
[2:20:13.640 --> 2:20:18.200]  deliver me from these demons yeah tyranny never stops but God doesn't
[2:20:18.200 --> 2:20:22.640]  either Roger final final comment though don't you think the optics of a Trump
[2:20:22.640 --> 2:20:28.760]  rally with 50,000 60,000 100,000 people will really send shockwaves into the
[2:20:28.760 --> 2:20:33.160]  Biden administration that couldn't get a hundred people for a Biden rally it yet
[2:20:33.160 --> 2:20:38.800]  proves that the questions about the irregularities and the anomalies in the
[2:20:38.800 --> 2:20:43.080]  last election are entirely legitimate and it proves that the people are with
[2:20:43.080 --> 2:20:47.920]  Trump let's be very candid Joe Biden could not collect 200 people at a rally
[2:20:47.920 --> 2:20:52.320]  in the district of Columbia I'm not gonna sit here and waste your time or my
[2:20:52.320 --> 2:20:58.160]  time and rattle off the successes and for worse is that if you're paying
[2:20:58.160 --> 2:21:04.840]  attention you know we've done together but I'll tell you this the technocrats
[2:21:04.840 --> 2:21:09.280]  are really up in their game and they are trying to destroy all independent
[2:21:09.280 --> 2:21:14.560]  forms of media they're trying to shudder and silence human resistance so now is
[2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:18.240]  the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven
[2:21:18.240 --> 2:21:21.120]  accurate everything you warned your friends and family about surround to be
[2:21:21.120 --> 2:21:25.880]  true so it's now that your credibility is way up the power structures of the
[2:21:25.880 --> 2:21:32.520]  silence those of us that they can look up to all of us to not let them silence
[2:21:32.520 --> 2:21:38.360]  any of us we have the power but the sun is setting on humanity and setting on
[2:21:38.360 --> 2:21:43.240]  free speech we have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that

[2:25:25.800 --> 2:25:32.480]  about serious news and so Alex joins us now on vacation Alex you are on the Alex
[2:25:32.480 --> 2:25:38.720]  Jones show welcome. Well I'm on a work occasion and I've been talking to a lot
[2:25:38.720 --> 2:25:42.480]  of folks that are involved the Liberty Movement here in Florida which I have to
[2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:48.080]  tell you DeSantis has been way ahead of Governor Abbott when it comes to fighting
[2:25:48.080 --> 2:25:53.320]  the globalists and fighting the whole COVID power grab but finally Governor
[2:25:53.320 --> 2:25:57.800]  Abbott did something that actually engaged in leadership and he won up
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:02.920]  Governor DeSantis and said thousand dollar fines for private businesses and
[2:26:02.920 --> 2:26:08.480]  of course for schools and other facilities that try to make people wear
[2:26:08.480 --> 2:26:13.400]  masks and discriminate against them if they're not wearing masks and that goes
[2:26:13.400 --> 2:26:19.360]  into effect coming up in just a few days on the 22nd of this month just a
[2:26:19.360 --> 2:26:24.400]  couple days and then the public schools have until June 2nd and when I guess all
[2:26:24.400 --> 2:26:28.880]  of their people are out then they have until the summer school starts to stop
[2:26:28.880 --> 2:26:33.560]  their activity that's because Texas has had the last two weeks zero COVID deaths
[2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:38.240]  now a lot of people are asking wow great job well it's because it's all a fraud
[2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:41.520]  know the virus is real I'll talk about it next segment but it's way ever blown
[2:26:41.520 --> 2:26:51.000]  the PCR test recommendation from the CDC was at 40 cycles and at 40 cycles you
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:59.160]  get 94% false positives and some studies higher even our times about that in
[2:26:59.160 --> 2:27:05.880]  Texas and other areas as soon as the CDC said go down to 29 cycles they did now
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:13.920]  when did they go to 29 cycles they went to 29 cycles 29 cycles literally on the
[2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:20.720]  21st of January 2021 that is the day after Biden was able to steal his way
[2:27:20.720 --> 2:27:25.080]  into the White House so they wanted to make it look like oh my god he's there
[2:27:25.080 --> 2:27:29.680]  now this crisis they use to get rid of Trump and bring all this tyranny can be
[2:27:29.680 --> 2:27:32.960]  taken off of us for a while before it's brought back in on us and I'm gonna
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:36.160]  predict when the next lockdowns are coming next segment of course they're
[2:27:36.160 --> 2:27:39.000]  gonna stay in place in the UK they're gonna stay in place in Canada or a
[2:27:39.000 --> 2:27:43.840]  stay in place in Australia because the public puts up with it and they're
[2:27:43.840 --> 2:27:46.880]  bringing in their global ID and they need countries that submit to this to
[2:27:46.880 --> 2:27:51.240]  work out the kinks and be able to test the global ID the global social credit
[2:27:51.240 --> 2:27:54.440]  score the global medical score that Klaus Schwab Bill Gates and others have
[2:27:54.440 --> 2:27:59.560]  talked about but we can defeat it we can stop it we have to understand this this
[2:27:59.560 --> 2:28:03.840]  no man is an island and and this country is very small this world is very
[2:28:03.840 --> 2:28:08.800]  small the world is smaller all the time and what's happening in Spain what's
[2:28:08.800 --> 2:28:11.560]  happening in Australia what's happening in New Zealand what's happening in the
[2:28:11.560 --> 2:28:15.680]  UK what's happening in Canada even if we don't have empathy for those folks
[2:28:15.680 --> 2:28:19.960]  which I do it's going to affect us because the same predators that are
[2:28:19.960 --> 2:28:24.520]  doing this to them are coming to do it to us so that is coming up next segment
[2:28:24.520 --> 2:28:32.920]  with huge it's always huge but but but COVID-19 takeover information and
[2:28:32.920 --> 2:28:37.760]  nothing is bigger except God nothing is bigger in their political operations than
[2:28:37.760 --> 2:28:40.840]  COVID-19 it is the roll out of the medical terrain is the roll out of the
[2:28:40.840 --> 2:28:46.040]  medical hysteria it is the cornerstone of their entire global cashless society
[2:28:46.040 --> 2:28:51.320]  AI system in their own words and must be opposed Schwab says there's gonna be
[2:28:51.320 --> 2:28:57.480]  problems with face scanning and global IDs to buy and sell and so Schwab says
[2:28:57.480 --> 2:29:01.760]  the answer will be first bracelets you wear he said this five years ago now we
[2:29:01.760 --> 2:29:06.200]  have the bracelets in California and in places like Israel and now they're
[2:29:06.200 --> 2:29:09.440]  trying to roll them out in New York but next it will be implantable chips so
[2:29:09.440 --> 2:29:12.720]  quote people don't steal the bracelets you say well that'll never happen they'll
[2:29:12.720 --> 2:29:17.680]  get probably 20% of the public especially in blue cities if they said get
[2:29:17.680 --> 2:29:21.520]  back to normal get a microchip under your skin they get it I predict five
[2:29:21.520 --> 2:29:25.400]  percent conservatively under Stockholm syndrome currently will take a brain
[2:29:25.400 --> 2:29:29.120]  chip and of course Schwab says that's coming after that so it's always more
[2:29:29.120 --> 2:29:32.240]  more more to get into your body to take over your life that's coming up next
[2:29:32.240 --> 2:29:36.480]  segment but here's the really big news ladies and gentlemen I know Owen and
[2:29:36.480 --> 2:29:40.520]  Rogers gonna have already been covering this I'm glad they were but here it is
[2:29:40.520 --> 2:29:43.960]  ladies and gentlemen you see this in my hands from the Daily Mail and it's all
[2:29:43.960 --> 2:29:47.680]  confirmed it's it's been on Hunter's laptop the whole time the Daily Mail is
[2:29:47.680 --> 2:29:51.480]  willing to go through the tens of thousands of emails we talked to
[2:29:51.480 --> 2:29:56.200]  journalists that got into them there was so much child porn and him having sex
[2:29:56.200 --> 2:30:00.240]  with his niece and the rest of it Hunter Biden that I told my crew I said we're
[2:30:00.240 --> 2:30:03.600]  not off here but I'm pretty sure Louis Free was the one in charge of the Penn
[2:30:03.600 --> 2:30:08.760]  State child trafficking operation investigation to guys guys look that up
[2:30:08.760 --> 2:30:13.360]  while I was just talking I'm pretty sure no no he wasn't charged of it my god in
[2:30:13.360 --> 2:30:17.440]  fact that's on my note right here Penn State see that right there that's on my
[2:30:17.440 --> 2:30:25.240]  note Penn State so yes that's where I was going next absolutely so understand
[2:30:25.240 --> 2:30:30.040]  that I said at the time I said we are not gonna look at this laptop because I
[2:30:30.040 --> 2:30:33.720]  talked to journalists that I know in respect and they said it's child porn
[2:30:33.720 --> 2:30:37.800]  it's it's it's it's Asian girls like they're 10 years old being tortured by
[2:30:37.800 --> 2:30:43.000]  Hunter Biden it's him having sex with his niece and I said they were to try to
[2:30:43.000 --> 2:30:47.160]  set us up with child porn before with unopened emails I said I told the crew I
[2:30:47.160 --> 2:30:51.720]  said you are not as an employers employee to open the Hunter Biden emails and we
[2:30:51.720 --> 2:30:54.720]  are not to have them on our servers because they will set us up and send us
[2:30:54.720 --> 2:30:57.880]  to prison I said it's up to somebody else that has the courage to do it well the
[2:30:57.880 --> 2:31:03.120]  Daily Mail did it okay the Daily Mail did it and it's Louis Free who ran the
[2:31:03.120 --> 2:31:07.680]  cover-up of Penn State where Sandusky had all these cottages that rich people
[2:31:07.680 --> 2:31:12.800]  came to to have sex with children as young as five years of age and so he was
[2:31:12.800 --> 2:31:18.160]  just the he was just a procurer and so here it is former FBI director Louis
[2:31:18.160 --> 2:31:21.720]  Free gave a hundred thousand dollars to a private trust for Joe Biden's
[2:31:21.720 --> 2:31:27.040]  grandchildren but remember the big guy always gets half he gets half of a
[2:31:27.040 --> 2:31:33.000]  company he's on he gets 10% upfront even before taxes everything else so that
[2:31:33.000 --> 2:31:36.040]  means to him former and then that's why his tax returns been released there's
[2:31:36.040 --> 2:31:40.960]  not that much money there but he has like eight giant houses and all the rest
[2:31:40.960 --> 2:31:46.840]  of it is because it's all owned by his brothers by his wife and by his son and
[2:31:46.840 --> 2:31:52.080]  grandchildren and nieces and reportedly they're so satanic and there's such
[2:31:52.080 --> 2:31:56.360]  pervs that they basically all have sex with each other that's why Biden's wife
[2:31:56.360 --> 2:32:00.560]  dresses like a street walking 20 year old hooker you know in fish nets and
[2:32:00.560 --> 2:32:05.040]  miniskirts because I mean it is it is it is something else so former FBI
[2:32:05.040 --> 2:32:11.240]  director Louis Free gave 100,000 to a private trust for Joe Biden's grandchildren
[2:32:11.240 --> 2:32:17.240]  and it's all his emails are in here this is all confirmed and this is this is
[2:32:17.240 --> 2:32:21.520]  what they've got going on here and this is what's unfolding and this is just
[2:32:21.520 --> 2:32:25.160]  what we know of of his laptop that he now admits is his so Google Facebook
[2:32:25.160 --> 2:32:28.680]  Twitter everyone's signing on to defending this and covering this up and
[2:32:28.680 --> 2:32:34.960]  censoring his laptop during the election they were election meddling and
[2:32:34.960 --> 2:32:39.440]  they were backing a Chinese Communist front group there's even audio recorded
[2:32:39.440 --> 2:32:42.840]  of him saying he works for Chinese intelligence and so there you have it
[2:32:42.840 --> 2:32:47.480]  out the open ladies and gentlemen I suggest everyone goes and read this
[2:32:47.480 --> 2:32:51.760]  this is free working with a bunch of people now in prison world leaders now
[2:32:51.760 --> 2:32:57.880]  in prison looting pension funds of old people that's that's the FBI's new
[2:32:57.880 --> 2:33:04.240]  specialty multi-billion dollar ransacking of Malaysian wealth fund 71 year old
[2:33:04.240 --> 2:33:07.280]  who serves up the director under Bill Clinton and George Bush ran a consultancy
[2:33:07.280 --> 2:33:10.560]  firm with highly controversial clients including now jailed Malaysian prime
[2:33:10.560 --> 2:33:17.920]  minister who stole billions it just goes on it's a long report and you can see you
[2:33:17.920 --> 2:33:23.640]  can see the stuff that's on the laptop it's photos of his dad now the puppet
[2:33:23.640 --> 2:33:28.800]  president it's all of that and it's it's the emails they chose to get into this
[2:33:28.800 --> 2:33:35.160]  not the Asian ten-year-old girls being beaten and not the trophy photos of the
[2:33:35.160 --> 2:33:41.280]  naked hunter Biden with his niece in the bedroom after with sweat dripping all
[2:33:41.280 --> 2:33:44.880]  over them but this is a very very important you can almost argue
[2:33:44.880 --> 2:33:48.840]  pedophilia is very important but it's almost a distraction from the espionage
[2:33:48.840 --> 2:33:56.240]  and working for foreign government so the FBI is like a broker like you might
[2:33:56.240 --> 2:34:01.080]  get a broker to sell you a boat or you might get a broker to sell you real
[2:34:01.080 --> 2:34:09.400]  estate but the FBI at the top now is a broker for world government and for
[2:34:09.400 --> 2:34:13.560]  selling out what's left of our children and the country and and that's just a
[2:34:13.560 --> 2:34:18.400]  fact that that's a reality and that's why they just passed it in the house they
[2:34:18.400 --> 2:34:23.800]  may have the votes of the Senate to start the new insurrection commission not
[2:34:23.800 --> 2:34:28.120]  real hearings where they demonize yours truly and and and President Trump and
[2:34:28.120 --> 2:34:33.520]  others and then never give you a chance to respond to them another kangaroo
[2:34:33.520 --> 2:34:37.120]  operation by the way I want a real congressional investigation I'd like to
[2:34:37.120 --> 2:34:41.120]  be called to Congress it's gonna come out that Antifa was there it's gonna come
[2:34:41.120 --> 2:34:45.200]  out that globalist posing as a cue group told people to go into the Capitol it's
[2:34:45.200 --> 2:34:50.760]  gonna come out that that when the media says that I was orchestrating this I'm
[2:34:50.760 --> 2:34:54.800]  not gonna say this five times in a row to be obnoxious I'm saying it because
[2:34:54.800 --> 2:34:59.640]  it's the key to victory over these criminals last week the arch globalist
[2:34:59.640 --> 2:35:06.160]  Fauci admitted that roughly half of the CDC's top brass and workers medical
[2:35:06.160 --> 2:35:10.640]  doctors scientists nurses you name it have taken the so-called COVID-19
[2:35:10.640 --> 2:35:16.680]  frankenshot I'm gonna say the second time around half of the doctors at the CDC
[2:35:16.680 --> 2:35:23.200]  and NIH refused to take the frankenshots they don't trust it you
[2:35:23.200 --> 2:35:26.480]  shouldn't trust it the vaccines have been banned in most countries around the
[2:35:26.480 --> 2:35:31.320]  world this is an attack on the American people the people the world this is an
[2:35:31.320 --> 2:35:37.280]  absolute red flag smoking gun again let me say it two more times around half the
[2:35:37.280 --> 2:35:41.440]  individuals that work at the NIH and CDC the medical staff refused to take the
[2:35:41.440 --> 2:35:46.880]  vaccines that's right the doctors nurses do not trust a so-called vaccine and you
[2:35:46.880 --> 2:35:51.240]  shouldn't either everyone you know about the truth all of the experts agree

[2:39:20.320 --> 2:39:24.960]  dollars incredible developments here alex well it really is oh and again
[2:39:24.960 --> 2:39:29.840]  these are the people that are now launching a fake commission that are
[2:39:29.840 --> 2:39:34.000]  telling us that the greatest attack on us soils is pearl harbor that killed
[2:39:34.000 --> 2:39:38.080]  three thousand people was four hundred five hundred people going in the

[2:39:46.360 --> 2:39:51.520]  the most deadly event we need a commission on the former fbi director
[2:39:51.520 --> 2:39:57.640]  sending a hundred thousand dollars to joe biden and saying in the emails i want
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:40:01.240]  to do business with you through the white house with foreign companies i want
[2:40:01.240 --> 2:40:08.360]  to do illegal lobbying and give you a hundred thousand dollar bribe to your trust

[2:41:06.280 --> 2:41:08.480]  where men have sex with boys
[2:41:08.480 --> 2:41:11.040]  it would get uh... it was not seen that was looking for girls but it was seen

[2:43:06.640 --> 2:43:07.320]  don't
[2:43:07.320 --> 2:43:10.160]  take this seriously as an operation
[2:43:10.160 --> 2:43:11.000]  we're done
[2:43:11.000 --> 2:43:13.400]  that means the employers operation will shut down
[2:43:13.400 --> 2:43:16.640]  if this isn't taken seriously by myself
[2:43:16.640 --> 2:43:18.040]  and by the listeners
[2:43:18.040 --> 2:43:19.440]  and by the crew
[2:43:19.440 --> 2:43:22.720]  and by everyone okay
[2:43:22.720 --> 2:43:26.120]  i got word yesterday morning that ban this dot tv
[2:43:26.120 --> 2:43:27.640]  is banned on facebook
[2:43:27.640 --> 2:43:29.160]  and twitter and other platforms
[2:43:29.160 --> 2:43:30.920]  you cannot share or promote
[2:43:30.920 --> 2:43:32.800]  ban this dot tv
[2:43:32.800 --> 2:43:34.040]  pretty important issue
[2:43:34.040 --> 2:43:35.480]  we're in information war
[2:43:35.480 --> 2:43:36.960]  people are hungry for truth
[2:43:36.960 --> 2:43:40.000]  now we created banned on video a few years ago it's gotten very popular
[2:43:40.000 --> 2:43:43.720]  we can only share that via word of mouth review your email or text message
[2:43:43.720 --> 2:43:44.640]  for now
[2:43:44.640 --> 2:43:48.480]  you can't share it on any of the big tech platforms you can try
[2:43:48.480 --> 2:43:51.480]  so we create new urls that mirror the same site
[2:43:51.480 --> 2:43:52.600]  and the same links
[2:43:52.600 --> 2:43:55.360]  we've had a lot of those twenty twenty election center
[2:43:55.360 --> 2:43:58.160]  and we've had banned this dot tv and after a few months each time
[2:43:58.160 --> 2:43:59.200]  they ban
[2:43:59.200 --> 2:44:03.240]  the new url once it propagates once it gets big
[2:44:03.240 --> 2:44:04.880]  so there's a new one and
[2:44:04.880 --> 2:44:06.760]  maybe tomorrow i'm not sure
[2:44:06.760 --> 2:44:10.480]  we're gonna have it for you but it's in the lower third today
[2:44:10.480 --> 2:44:14.040]  okay it's in the lower third today
[2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:16.920]  and we need to promote this everywhere
[2:44:16.920 --> 2:44:18.320]  and we need to get this out okay
[2:44:18.320 --> 2:44:21.680]  it's free world news dot tv
[2:44:21.680 --> 2:44:24.120]  free world news dot tv
[2:44:24.120 --> 2:44:26.280]  free world news dot tv
[2:44:26.280 --> 2:44:28.120]  free world news dot tv
[2:44:28.120 --> 2:44:29.840]  free world news dot tv
[2:44:29.840 --> 2:44:31.520]  free world news dot tv
[2:44:31.520 --> 2:44:32.840]  free world news dot tv
[2:44:32.840 --> 2:44:34.360]  free world news dot tv
[2:44:34.360 --> 2:44:35.780]  free world news dot tv
[2:44:35.780 --> 2:44:36.880]  and i know that's annoying
[2:44:36.880 --> 2:44:38.840]  but see we're under censorship, we're under attack
[2:44:38.840 --> 2:44:41.360]  we've to get out of the comic, get out of the trance
[2:44:41.360 --> 2:44:43.760]  and we've got to realize that's a total war
[2:44:43.760 --> 2:44:45.560]  because
[2:44:45.560 --> 2:44:52.080]  I showed you yesterday the Hazardous Materials page from the Connecticut website where they
[2:44:52.080 --> 2:44:58.560]  admitted that the Moderna shop has SM120 and then it gave the damn ingredients.
[2:44:58.560 --> 2:45:01.920]  And people immediately in the comments on Band-Aught Video said, oh, this can't be that
[2:45:01.920 --> 2:45:02.920]  SM102.
[2:45:02.920 --> 2:45:05.240]  It's so deadly when it is.
[2:45:05.240 --> 2:45:09.720]  And now people got the EU Moderna site even showing it with the full breakdown because
[2:45:09.720 --> 2:45:17.720]  there was one line on the Connecticut site that wasn't on another fact sheet.
[2:45:17.720 --> 2:45:22.120]  It's the real one SM102 that it says will kill people and cause infertility.
[2:45:22.120 --> 2:45:24.080]  See, that's a big deal.
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:29.800]  And the only way that dog hunts is when people share the videos from Band-Aught Video and
[2:45:29.800 --> 2:45:34.520]  then emergency report to save lives because we're under bio and chemical and globalist
[2:45:34.520 --> 2:45:38.600]  attack and we're under radiological attack and we're under electromagnetic attack and
[2:45:38.600 --> 2:45:40.520]  the 5G and the globalist all admit this.
[2:45:40.520 --> 2:45:45.080]  So there has to be a sense of urgency.
[2:45:45.080 --> 2:45:52.880]  There has to be a sense of urgency with myself and with everybody else or it's game over.
[2:45:52.880 --> 2:45:53.880]  Okay?
[2:45:53.880 --> 2:45:58.000]  You know, I'm trying and that's why I came to Florida to get national political movements
[2:45:58.000 --> 2:46:03.320]  going to organize those hundred and plus generals that wrote the letter saying America's under
[2:46:03.320 --> 2:46:04.320]  globalist attack.
[2:46:04.320 --> 2:46:08.000]  America's under Marxist attack as they had a spaceport said and got fired because we're
[2:46:08.000 --> 2:46:09.640]  under Marxist attack.
[2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:13.720]  In America, general can't say we're under Marxist attack when we are under Marxist attack
[2:46:13.720 --> 2:46:17.400]  and Black Lives Matter is Marxist and Antifa is Marxist but if you call it the elephant
[2:46:17.400 --> 2:46:21.840]  in the room, you're taken down because censorship and an enemy takeover is King Daddy.
[2:46:21.840 --> 2:46:22.960]  So I'm not really on vacation.
[2:46:22.960 --> 2:46:24.800]  I'm here trying to get this done.
[2:46:24.800 --> 2:46:29.400]  But if we can't get this information out of the world and if the Lister's don't realize
[2:46:29.400 --> 2:46:32.920]  that they're the entire fight, that they're everything, then this dog doesn't hunt and
[2:46:32.920 --> 2:46:34.920]  the new order wins.
[2:46:34.920 --> 2:46:36.720]  So we need to show you next hour.
[2:46:36.720 --> 2:46:45.040]  We're going to get it because it's on ban.video, which now the URL is freeworldnews.tv.
[2:46:45.040 --> 2:46:46.040]  And it's on there.
[2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:50.080]  We have the footage of the airplanes in McAllen being loaded.
[2:46:50.080 --> 2:46:52.040]  We have the footage of the kids going in front.
[2:46:52.040 --> 2:46:53.040]  We have it all.
[2:46:53.040 --> 2:46:54.040]  And I'm not mad at the Listers.
[2:46:54.040 --> 2:46:55.040]  I'm not mad at the callers.
[2:46:55.040 --> 2:46:56.040]  I'm not mad at the crew.
[2:46:56.040 --> 2:47:00.120]  I'm just fired up because see, here's the thing, I'm conscious and I'm awake and I
[2:47:00.120 --> 2:47:01.120]  know there's a takeover.
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:04.880]  And I know if we get people upset, realizing it's happening and if people have that fire
[2:47:04.880 --> 2:47:08.080]  in their belly and they tell others it's came over, why do you think they're taking the
[2:47:08.080 --> 2:47:09.080]  mask off?
[2:47:09.080 --> 2:47:11.600]  Why do you think they're admitting that COVID-19 was whatever blown?
[2:47:11.600 --> 2:47:19.800]  Because people are pissed and because the truth is all coming out, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:47:19.800 --> 2:47:23.680]  The world is awakening and that is the exciting thing.
[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:25.080]  That is the powerful thing.
[2:47:25.080 --> 2:47:26.240]  That is the huge thing.
[2:47:26.240 --> 2:47:28.000]  That is the massive thing.
[2:47:28.000 --> 2:47:31.720]  And so we have to keep, because they're going to take the pressure off now until we dissipate
[2:47:31.720 --> 2:47:34.320]  our movement and they're going to put it right back on.
[2:47:34.320 --> 2:47:35.320]  That's tactic.
[2:47:35.320 --> 2:47:40.200]  And so, I don't understand, this is a worldwide fight for all of us, no matter where we live,
[2:47:40.200 --> 2:47:41.200]  no matter where we are.
[2:47:41.200 --> 2:47:42.200]  So I want to thank the Listers.
[2:47:42.200 --> 2:47:43.200]  I want to thank the crew.
[2:47:43.200 --> 2:47:48.160]  And I want to just ask everybody, promote FreeWorldNews.tv, because it was the last
[2:47:48.160 --> 2:47:53.880]  straw for them when we exposed, the video that finally got it banned was this SDM 102.
[2:47:53.880 --> 2:48:00.760]  We're also having a debate on the Israel-Palestine crisis, Tuesday evening starting at 6, a real
[2:48:00.760 --> 2:48:03.160]  debate starts at about 6.30 central.
[2:48:03.160 --> 2:48:06.880]  I'm the only person moderating it, because I'm going to do an old-fashioned moderation,
[2:48:06.880 --> 2:48:11.560]  where I'm only going to control the time, and I may ask maybe three questions the whole
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:12.560]  time.
[2:48:12.560 --> 2:48:14.800]  It's going to be an hour and a half debate, and it's going to be a real debate, like
[2:48:14.800 --> 2:48:19.360]  Lincoln Douglas, and then Owen Schreuer and Harrison Smith will come in after we're done
[2:48:19.360 --> 2:48:22.360]  and give their take on the debate and take your phone calls.
[2:48:22.360 --> 2:48:24.840]  So that's coming up Tuesday evening as well.
[2:48:24.840 --> 2:48:25.960]  We built this platform.
[2:48:25.960 --> 2:48:26.960]  You built this platform.
[2:48:26.960 --> 2:48:28.840]  The only reason we're here is because you're the listeners.
[2:48:28.840 --> 2:48:32.480]  I salute you and thank you, but your word of mouth isn't just king, it's victory.
[2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:33.760]  If you don't do it, it's over.
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:36.840]  You've been doing it, so we're having victory, but we've got to keep pushing and keep fighting
[2:48:36.840 --> 2:48:39.200]  until Bill Gates and Fauci and the new order are in prison.
[2:48:39.200 --> 2:48:41.920]  All right, I've got the big COVID news when we come back.
[2:48:41.920 --> 2:48:46.440]  Matt Bracken will come up, but I've got to go as long as I need you to get all this out.
[2:48:46.440 --> 2:48:50.600]  And then Owen Schreuer is coming up with his guest host he's got today, 3 to 6 p.m. Central
[2:48:50.600 --> 2:48:57.840]  M4Wars.com, and now, 3worldnews.tv, 3worldnews.tv, 3worldnews.tv, share it.
[2:48:57.840 --> 2:49:03.200]  I'm up here working on a Thursday night in mid-April 2021, and I just want to say something.
[2:49:03.200 --> 2:49:07.520]  I am so blessed and honored to work with this incredible crew that has come together over
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:11.840]  the years and has truly been answered a prayer, and I am so blessed and thankful for all of
[2:49:11.840 --> 2:49:12.840]  you, the listeners of this show.
[2:49:12.840 --> 2:49:17.360]  I want you to know that I love you and I appreciate you, whether you are old, whether you are
[2:49:17.360 --> 2:49:21.200]  spanning white, black, it doesn't matter if you've got red blood, and if you love freedom
[2:49:21.200 --> 2:49:26.440]  and justice, and if you love our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together
[2:49:26.440 --> 2:49:31.360]  and it has just been an incredible experience to work with you over the years, and as crazy
[2:49:31.360 --> 2:49:34.160]  your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:37.680]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:42.920]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us,
[2:49:42.920 --> 2:49:45.120]  but again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[2:49:45.120 --> 2:49:48.680]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[2:49:48.680 --> 2:49:53.880]  done, and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you, and
[2:49:53.880 --> 2:49:59.120]  hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support Him for the worst, God bless.
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:07.600]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at
[2:50:07.600 --> 2:50:10.880]  surviving in this crazy environment when you have high-quality fish oil and we've got the
[2:50:10.880 --> 2:50:11.880]  best out there.
[2:50:11.880 --> 2:50:17.320]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available and what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:50:17.320 --> 2:50:20.520]  Everybody already knows what high-quality fish oil does, and it costs us even more to put
[2:50:20.520 --> 2:50:23.360]  it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[2:50:23.360 --> 2:50:25.000]  This is also clean at fish oil.
[2:50:25.000 --> 2:50:28.320]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[2:50:28.320 --> 2:50:29.760]  Grill oil is set to sell out.
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:31.400]  It's amazing as well.
[2:50:31.400 --> 2:50:37.360]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.
[2:50:37.360 --> 2:50:42.080]  Ultimate fish oil, now back in stock at InfoWareStore.com, and when I forget to take it, I really
[2:50:42.080 --> 2:50:43.080]  feel it.
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:46.000]  When I take a couple of them before I go to sleep at night, it makes my dreams even more
[2:50:46.000 --> 2:50:47.000]  amazing.
[2:50:47.000 --> 2:50:48.160]  Blizzard thought I was joking.
[2:50:48.160 --> 2:50:50.200]  You've tried it out and most of you have been blown away.

[2:51:02.120 --> 2:51:13.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:51:13.040 --> 2:51:24.720]  All right, I haven't been on air in a few days, you can tell I'm wound up, and I'm upset
[2:51:24.720 --> 2:51:28.920]  and I'm angry because we should be upset, we should be angry, and I see so many people
[2:51:28.920 --> 2:51:34.840]  saying, oh, we got our freedoms back, oh, Governor, Abbot of the Right thing, oh, that's
[2:51:34.840 --> 2:51:38.600]  all because of what you did and what I did and all the prayer.
[2:51:38.600 --> 2:51:41.640]  But the enemy is only going to back off a little bit, they're going to come back again
[2:51:41.640 --> 2:51:44.080]  and most of the world is still locked down.
[2:51:44.080 --> 2:51:47.880]  In Latin America and Africa, they're still locked down under damned dictatorships doing
[2:51:47.880 --> 2:51:48.880]  this.
[2:51:48.880 --> 2:51:53.000]  That's why it was important for America to lead us the hell out of this nightmare.
[2:51:53.000 --> 2:51:57.360]  You got communist, Chinese academics and generals admitting they launched COVID-19 on us.
[2:51:57.360 --> 2:52:01.720]  Oh, and Shroyer, this is one hell of a time to be alive, and man, you see something like
[2:52:01.720 --> 2:52:08.280]  Louis Free, the FBI director that covered up the whole Sandusky situation in Penn State
[2:52:08.280 --> 2:52:13.520]  to see him saying, I gave you $100,000, this is the start, I want to be in business with
[2:52:13.520 --> 2:52:17.600]  you, I want to pay you for everything you do with world leaders.
[2:52:17.600 --> 2:52:23.920]  So literally paying illegally for policy, quid pro quo, everything they said Trump was doing,
[2:52:23.920 --> 2:52:24.920]  Trump never did it.
[2:52:24.920 --> 2:52:26.120]  I mean, this is just incredible.
[2:52:26.120 --> 2:52:30.160]  And now this is going to come out and I bet you bottom dollar, nothing happens to free
[2:52:30.160 --> 2:52:31.640]  because they're all involved in this.
[2:52:31.640 --> 2:52:33.920]  These are sycophantic dirty lawyers.
[2:52:33.920 --> 2:52:39.040]  Well, the amazing thing is the more you cover this stuff, the more the swamp creatures and
[2:52:39.040 --> 2:52:42.640]  the same names and the same faces continue to rear the ruggly heads.
[2:52:42.640 --> 2:52:45.800]  And the reason why when you were covering this earlier and I was listening to you and
[2:52:45.800 --> 2:52:49.440]  you said Louis Free, it was just like the sparks in my brain started flying because
[2:52:49.440 --> 2:52:54.720]  I remember when 10 years ago, I don't remember the time, but working in sports media covering
[2:52:54.720 --> 2:52:57.600]  Louis Free, knowing he was corrupt then.
[2:52:57.600 --> 2:52:59.600]  And it's just like this guy just doesn't go away.
[2:52:59.600 --> 2:53:05.120]  And it's always around this pedophile behavior, first at the Penn State, now with the Bidens
[2:53:05.120 --> 2:53:07.760]  and we know what Hunter is doing with the laptop.
[2:53:07.760 --> 2:53:09.320]  So I mean, it's really just incredible.
[2:53:09.320 --> 2:53:11.720]  And Alex, think about this.
[2:53:11.720 --> 2:53:16.400]  They're now putting out some more information about the raid of Rudy Giuliani's apartment
[2:53:16.400 --> 2:53:20.480]  in New York City saying, oh, look at all these different electronic devices they seized.
[2:53:20.480 --> 2:53:22.760]  They left the Hunter Biden laptop.
[2:53:22.760 --> 2:53:28.080]  I mean, I'm almost wondering if Giuliani knew it was coming, put the laptop out there thinking
[2:53:28.080 --> 2:53:32.080]  they would take it, and then like somehow they knew it was Hunter Biden's laptop and
[2:53:32.080 --> 2:53:35.160]  they took every other thing except that hard drive.
[2:53:35.160 --> 2:53:41.080]  Well, he told him, he said, this is Hunter Biden's hard drive and under the law, they
[2:53:41.080 --> 2:53:42.400]  were supposed to take it.
[2:53:42.400 --> 2:53:44.240]  They were ordered by the court.
[2:53:44.240 --> 2:53:47.520]  So they're in contempt of court and they were obstructing justice.
[2:53:47.520 --> 2:53:48.520]  This is the Hunter Biden laptop.
[2:53:48.520 --> 2:53:50.600]  They're like, whoa, whoa, whoa, we don't want that.
[2:53:50.600 --> 2:53:54.640]  And that's the security they've got in knowing that they're able to commit these crimes.
[2:53:54.640 --> 2:53:59.120]  The FBI has always had problems with power corrupts, absolute power corrupts, absolutely.
[2:53:59.120 --> 2:54:04.240]  And there's decent FBI agents that respond to bank robberies and kidnap kids and stuff.
[2:54:04.240 --> 2:54:10.480]  But at the top politically, the top 10% of the FBI is the worst people in this country.
[2:54:10.480 --> 2:54:15.200]  They have presided over the selling out of this nation, over the giant pedophile rings.
[2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:20.840]  They've just presided over the abject bankruptcy and they've really protected the most corrupt
[2:54:20.840 --> 2:54:25.400]  ruling class in dividing and conquering this nation.
[2:54:25.400 --> 2:54:28.960]  And then once you get corruption in, new corruption comes in that's even worse.
[2:54:28.960 --> 2:54:31.520]  And then more corruption comes in even worse than that.
[2:54:31.520 --> 2:54:35.200]  And then they're all blackmailing each other until the very worst takeover.
[2:54:35.200 --> 2:54:39.200]  And then pretty soon you're worshiping the saint of death and killing your own children.
[2:54:39.200 --> 2:54:41.480]  I mean, that's where all this goes.
[2:54:41.480 --> 2:54:42.480]  It leads to hell.
[2:54:42.480 --> 2:54:44.760]  And notice we're getting closer and closer to hell right now.
[2:54:44.760 --> 2:54:48.960]  Well, and I wonder too, Alex, because I know one of your frustrations and believe me, I
[2:54:48.960 --> 2:54:52.320]  understand is that, you know, with all the information that's been presented, everything
[2:54:52.320 --> 2:54:56.600]  we know, we shouldn't be continuing to fight this battle yet, yet every day it seems to
[2:54:56.600 --> 2:54:57.920]  get harder.
[2:54:57.920 --> 2:55:01.760]  And so it's like, what, what, what more do people have to see?
[2:55:01.760 --> 2:55:04.160]  How bad does it have to get?
[2:55:04.160 --> 2:55:08.880]  I mean, when they're talking about vaccines, killing people, and then they say safe and
[2:55:08.880 --> 2:55:12.480]  effective, but then they still make you wear a mask or they'll make you fine if you don't
[2:55:12.480 --> 2:55:13.480]  have a mask in Congress.
[2:55:13.480 --> 2:55:15.720]  So they're admitting that they're not effective.
[2:55:15.720 --> 2:55:17.840]  They're covering up the deadly side effects.
[2:55:17.840 --> 2:55:22.040]  I mean, this is a worldwide experiment with this, with this jab.
[2:55:22.040 --> 2:55:25.400]  And it's just like, oh, you know, whatever, it's just, you know, we just put up with this.
[2:55:25.400 --> 2:55:26.760]  We just put up with medical tyranny.
[2:55:26.760 --> 2:55:27.760]  It may kill us.
[2:55:27.760 --> 2:55:28.760]  It may kill us.
[2:55:28.760 --> 2:55:29.760]  And that's right.
[2:55:29.760 --> 2:55:32.760]  And, and, and under this, under this evil and history talks about this, the Bible talks
[2:55:32.760 --> 2:55:34.800]  about this.
[2:55:34.800 --> 2:55:38.800]  Once you get corruption in place, it's a, it's a college of evil.
[2:55:38.800 --> 2:55:41.520]  One guy's a pedophile, one person likes to torture people.
[2:55:41.520 --> 2:55:43.880]  Other person just wants to be super rich and rob people.
[2:55:43.880 --> 2:55:48.080]  Other person doesn't care, just dumps toxic waste in the ocean and, and, and soon they're
[2:55:48.080 --> 2:55:49.080]  all protected.
[2:55:49.080 --> 2:55:50.800]  They get to commit whatever crime they want.
[2:55:50.800 --> 2:55:55.560]  So Louis Fried just wants millions of dollars, but he protects pedophiles and, and uses them
[2:55:55.560 --> 2:56:01.000]  to be, to be bag men because they're compromised, but still he becomes a pedophile via extension
[2:56:01.000 --> 2:56:02.000]  by supporting him.
[2:56:02.000 --> 2:56:05.360]  We'll be right back with the biggest COVID-19 news yet with Owen Schroeder.
[2:56:05.360 --> 2:56:06.360]  Stay with us.
[2:56:06.360 --> 2:56:15.040]  The globalists have launched a massive counter offensive against populist forces worldwide.
[2:56:15.040 --> 2:56:16.040]  They are censoring.
[2:56:16.040 --> 2:56:17.040]  They are attacking.
[2:56:17.040 --> 2:56:19.560]  They are arresting patriots all over the world.
[2:56:19.560 --> 2:56:24.160]  Churches in Europe, Australia, the UK and Canada, and even California and New York are
[2:56:24.160 --> 2:56:28.280]  being swat teamed and closed because they're non-essential.
[2:56:28.280 --> 2:56:33.360]  The tyranny is incredible, but in areas like Texas and South Dakota and Florida where we
[2:56:33.360 --> 2:56:37.920]  have a history of more liberty, all the lockdowns are over, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:56:37.920 --> 2:56:38.920]  This is martial law.
[2:56:38.920 --> 2:56:42.400]  This has all been a massive martial law drill.
[2:56:42.400 --> 2:56:46.360]  And now it's more important than ever to spread the word about info wars and to support info
[2:56:46.360 --> 2:56:47.360]  wars.
[2:56:47.360 --> 2:56:50.640]  We have three of our best selling products selling out, but despite that, they're all
[2:56:50.640 --> 2:56:52.320]  massively discounted.
[2:56:52.320 --> 2:56:54.920]  Turbo force, it's 40% off.
[2:56:54.920 --> 2:56:59.720]  We've got ultimate fish oil, 50% off and winter sun for your immune system.
[2:56:59.720 --> 2:57:00.960]  It's 50% off as well.
[2:57:00.960 --> 2:57:07.960]  Still ever, take advantage of it at InfoWarsStore.com and fund the Info War.
[2:57:07.960 --> 2:57:22.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[2:57:22.680 --> 2:57:24.440]  You want to stop tyranny?
[2:57:24.440 --> 2:57:26.080]  Well, so does he.
[2:57:26.080 --> 2:57:36.560]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:57:36.560 --> 2:57:43.600]  We have had, we have witnessed 120-plus former top U.S. generals, so public can say America's
[2:57:43.600 --> 2:57:48.240]  being taken over by a globalist group using Marxism, which is exactly what it is, what
[2:57:48.240 --> 2:57:49.240]  we've said.
[2:57:49.240 --> 2:57:56.120]  8 megabanks, billionaires above the law, tax exempt, totally greedy, offshore, Steve Jobs'
[2:57:56.120 --> 2:57:58.560]  wives involved in it, it's incredible.
[2:57:58.560 --> 2:58:01.080]  They don't care about Chinese death camps, they love it.
[2:58:01.080 --> 2:58:05.960]  They don't care about sweatshops, they don't care about sex slavery, they like Africa starving
[2:58:05.960 --> 2:58:07.560]  to death in Latin America.
[2:58:07.560 --> 2:58:12.560]  But they soak it all in sicky, sweet political correctness and have all their corporate spokespersons
[2:58:12.560 --> 2:58:14.640]  be black people now.
[2:58:14.640 --> 2:58:18.800]  The globalists are using black people as their camouflage for their world government takeover
[2:58:18.800 --> 2:58:25.160]  and their particular targeting of black people with poisoned, tainted vaccines, with sterilants,
[2:58:25.160 --> 2:58:32.120]  with HIV, with deadly chemicals, and of course, it gets worse, ladies and gentlemen, actual
[2:58:32.120 --> 2:58:36.000]  live polio as reported by Reuters.
[2:58:36.000 --> 2:58:39.880]  And what is their response when Reuters comes out and admits that's going on?
[2:58:39.880 --> 2:58:44.720]  Well, Twitter takes down, even little clips Joe Rogan put out of me talking about it because
[2:58:44.720 --> 2:58:47.040]  it's so true and they can't handle the truth.
[2:58:47.040 --> 2:58:52.680]  So here's the safety data sheet on what's in the Moderna vaccine because the Pfizer
[2:58:52.680 --> 2:58:58.360]  also has a lipid in it that's associated with antifreeze, but this is even worse.
[2:58:58.360 --> 2:59:01.680]  And this is SM 102.
[2:59:01.680 --> 2:59:07.120]  And again, you can go read SM 102 and what it is.
[2:59:07.120 --> 2:59:10.080]  And people see this and they just can't believe it.
[2:59:10.080 --> 2:59:11.080]  They just can't believe it.
[2:59:11.080 --> 2:59:18.200]  And if you go to band.video, you can see, not the featured video now, it's moved down,
[2:59:18.200 --> 2:59:23.240]  that key headline there that's got to get out to people that the state of Connecticut
[2:59:23.240 --> 2:59:31.320]  warned, there it is, bombshell, horrifying bombshell, Connecticut warns Moderna vaccine
[2:59:31.320 --> 2:59:33.840]  contains deadly poison.
[2:59:33.840 --> 2:59:37.440]  That is so huge that needs to get out.
[2:59:37.440 --> 2:59:41.320]  This is a life and death situation, but that's yesterday's news.
[2:59:41.320 --> 2:59:43.840]  See, that's why I get so angry, why get so upset.
[2:59:43.840 --> 2:59:45.920]  I know all this is happening.
[2:59:45.920 --> 2:59:52.760]  I know that I'm talking to so many people in Florida, both who are military, but also
[2:59:52.760 --> 2:59:57.280]  just the general public that I'm running into who have friends and family that have already
[2:59:57.280 --> 3:00:01.400]  died or the lady at their church is fighting for her life, who's totally healthy after
[3:00:01.400 --> 3:00:05.280]  she took the Moderna shot or their neighbor died and taken the Pfizer shot.
[3:00:05.280 --> 3:00:09.960]  I mean, I'm seeing it, not just all the adverse reaction reports, not just all the famous
[3:00:09.960 --> 3:00:13.920]  people dying after they take the shot and then big tech and media bullying us and saying
[3:00:13.920 --> 3:00:16.120]  we're crazy, it doesn't exist.
[3:00:16.120 --> 3:00:23.880]  So they push, push, push, push, push, then opposition forms and then they back off for
[3:00:23.880 --> 3:00:29.120]  a while again to kill opposition and I know you know that, but I'm not really here even
[3:00:29.120 --> 3:00:31.400]  trying to have an interesting radio show or TV show.
[3:00:31.400 --> 3:00:35.580]  I'm here as an emergency broadcast to just hammer the key points and here's a huge key
[3:00:35.580 --> 3:00:37.080]  point that just developed.
[3:00:37.080 --> 3:00:44.200]  You see this, two hours that came out yesterday, got another one right here, came out three
[3:00:44.200 --> 3:00:46.520]  or four days ago.
[3:00:46.520 --> 3:00:52.120]  Texas reports zero coronavirus deaths for the first time since the pandemic began.
[3:00:52.120 --> 3:00:58.440]  No deaths for the first time in more than a year as the state's ramped up vaccine rollout
[3:00:58.440 --> 3:01:03.160]  has slash new infections, hospitalizations and fatalities from the virus.
[3:01:03.160 --> 3:01:06.200]  Oh really, the vaccine did it says Forbes.
[3:01:06.200 --> 3:01:14.040]  Funny, because we were called the Andrew Falls a month ago by Joe Biden, the public president
[3:01:14.040 --> 3:01:20.480]  when he opened everything back up completely and said we don't need the mask, then of course
[3:01:20.480 --> 3:01:24.880]  people just continued with the mask as they liked the idea of virtue signaling and being
[3:01:24.880 --> 3:01:29.280]  in like a movie like you know pretending they're a superhero.
[3:01:29.280 --> 3:01:33.360]  But what really happened is right after Joe Biden finally got into office, stole his way
[3:01:33.360 --> 3:01:43.120]  in after January 20th, he had the CDC lower the PCR test from 40 cycles to 29 and when
[3:01:43.120 --> 3:01:45.920]  you do that you get almost no positive cycles.
[3:01:45.920 --> 3:01:50.120]  When you do it at 40 you get 94% false positives, that's all confirmed.
[3:01:50.120 --> 3:01:52.960]  So that's how they did it and that's how the scam works.
[3:01:52.960 --> 3:01:58.280]  People report zero coronavirus deaths for the first time since the pandemic began.
[3:01:58.280 --> 3:02:04.080]  Governor Abbott issues executive order prohibiting government entities from mandating mask, thousand
[3:02:04.080 --> 3:02:08.120]  dollar fines, except he exempts nursing homes.
[3:02:08.120 --> 3:02:11.720]  Oh you still can't let family in to see their nursing home people so they can quietly kill
[3:02:11.720 --> 3:02:12.720]  them in there.
[3:02:12.720 --> 3:02:15.320]  That's some of these companies lobbied for folks.
[3:02:15.320 --> 3:02:18.560]  Some of the public schools still say they don't want parents ever coming into schools
[3:02:18.560 --> 3:02:22.480]  again and even private schools, oh sorry parents can't come in the building now.
[3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:25.400]  This is a recipe for total control.
[3:02:25.400 --> 3:02:28.200]  The teacher unions wrote this.
[3:02:28.200 --> 3:02:31.080]  Exempt from the executive order are state supported living centers, government owned
[3:02:31.080 --> 3:02:35.920]  and operated hospitals, Texas Department of Criminal Justice Facilities, Texas Juvenile
[3:02:35.920 --> 3:02:40.040]  Department of Facilities and County Municipal Jails, so basically prisoners.
[3:02:40.040 --> 3:02:43.320]  You're a prisoner in a nursing home, you're a prisoner in jail, you're a prisoner in a
[3:02:43.320 --> 3:02:49.040]  public school or a juvenile system, they're going to keep this going because this is all
[3:02:49.040 --> 3:02:50.040]  prisoner training.
[3:02:50.040 --> 3:02:53.720]  They're like oh the prisoners will still, what do you think lockdown is, that's a prison
[3:02:53.720 --> 3:02:54.720]  term.
[3:02:54.720 --> 3:03:00.640]  It's all martial law so here's that executive order and you've got other states that are
[3:03:00.640 --> 3:03:05.640]  halfway following suit but remember as soon as there's flu deaths or as soon as there's
[3:03:05.640 --> 3:03:09.000]  regular pneumonia deaths they're going to say well actually the flu is killing more
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:15.400]  than COVID did and they're now proposing in the EU, also in the UK and CNN is proposing
[3:03:15.400 --> 3:03:22.440]  oh let's actually have PCR tests for the flu and pneumonia and let's, there's one death,
[3:03:22.440 --> 3:03:26.600]  let's close Australia, let's close New Zealand, let's close Canada, Canada's still locked
[3:03:26.600 --> 3:03:31.800]  down, it's all made up, it's hysteria, oh there's one death so all your businesses are
[3:03:31.800 --> 3:03:37.200]  non-essential but big box tours are and they all double and triple their profits.
[3:03:37.200 --> 3:03:40.960]  This was all premeditated from start to finish.
[3:03:40.960 --> 3:03:44.840]  California to effectively end mass mandate when state fully reopens next month, governor
[3:03:44.840 --> 3:03:53.880]  Newsom says, oh governor Newsom facing recall, see the governor of Michigan facing recall,
[3:03:53.880 --> 3:03:57.480]  all of these people see but you can't really recall in the UK the corruption is so great
[3:03:57.480 --> 3:04:01.960]  or the EU, the EU is unelected by the way, do you know that, they have an elected bureaucracy
[3:04:01.960 --> 3:04:09.280]  that is called the EU parliament but the real bureaucracy above it is permanent, that's
[3:04:09.280 --> 3:04:10.280]  called the tyranny.
[3:04:10.280 --> 3:04:16.960]  West Virginia governor, justice lifts mass mandate for fully vaccinated residents, announces
[3:04:16.960 --> 3:04:22.600]  end to $300 unemployment supplement, what's so dangerous about that, it's introducing
[3:04:22.600 --> 3:04:27.240]  the vaccine passport idea that oh if you're fully vaccinated you don't need a mask but
[3:04:27.240 --> 3:04:31.680]  if you're not vaccinated you're dirty and need to wear a mask, that's putting you in
[3:04:31.680 --> 3:04:36.840]  a physical gulag suffocating you, making you cover your face like you're dirty and evil
[3:04:36.840 --> 3:04:41.360]  if you haven't taken this illegal franken shot filled with poisons that these psychos
[3:04:41.360 --> 3:04:47.680]  want you to take, then we've got this story at info wars dot com from our team and I looked
[3:04:47.680 --> 3:04:53.880]  over the articles even worse than they say, child suicide attempts up 200% in Canada under
[3:04:53.880 --> 3:04:59.600]  lockdowns that are ongoing, suicides themselves are way up in adults and children but attempts
[3:04:59.600 --> 3:05:05.200]  200% and over in the UK it's the same numbers, they've got them all right here, this is abuse
[3:05:05.200 --> 3:05:09.240]  and self harms way up, just like a parent or an elephant or a monkey will self harm
[3:05:09.240 --> 3:05:14.120]  when it's locked in a cage and not given things to do, this is so damn evil but it gets you
[3:05:14.120 --> 3:05:18.640]  watching big tech, gets you watching more Netflix, promise you watch dog you take COVID
[3:05:18.640 --> 3:05:23.640]  passport, small print says it will be used domestically, that's right of course it was
[3:05:23.640 --> 3:05:27.840]  always going to be used domestically, that's why in places like New York and other areas
[3:05:27.840 --> 3:05:31.440]  where they're trying to roll this out, you got to have law suits, you got to say no,
[3:05:31.440 --> 3:05:35.560]  oh we're open again, let's just comply, no, that's getting you deeper in the trap to bring
[3:05:35.560 --> 3:05:41.160]  the trap back even stronger next time, that is a fact, and it's over to Governor Tim
[3:05:41.160 --> 3:05:47.440]  Waltz to lift States mask mandate, see Texas leading the way now because the governor's
[3:05:47.440 --> 3:05:51.880]  not just saying if you're vaccinated you can take your mask off, no he's saying period
[3:05:51.880 --> 3:05:56.520]  stop it, so now the political pressure has really gotten him because an election is coming
[3:05:56.520 --> 3:06:05.080]  up and that's what elections are so important, now it gets worse at this point, if they're
[3:06:05.080 --> 3:06:08.000]  going to take over the country and take over the world how do they intend to do it, well
[3:06:08.000 --> 3:06:11.480]  they intend to do it through censorship, so let me put this URL and I'm going to come
[3:06:11.480 --> 3:06:14.360]  back next segment and finish up with Ellen at the hand of a thon to Matt Bracken who
[3:06:14.360 --> 3:06:21.560]  I really appreciate having me charge in here and that is the URL that we can put on screen
[3:06:21.560 --> 3:06:31.840]  that is the new URL because you can't promote ban this.tv, ban this.tv has been banned
[3:06:31.840 --> 3:06:38.920]  on Twitter and on Facebook so we've created a new system that gets around that for now,
[3:06:38.920 --> 3:06:45.880]  they'll end up banning this as well, free world news.tv and I'm not going to be obnoxious
[3:06:45.880 --> 3:06:50.480]  about this but just because you're awake that's great, you got to get others awake so you
[3:06:50.480 --> 3:06:55.000]  can share the live feed of the show from ban.video, you can share the live feed of any of the
[3:06:55.000 --> 3:07:00.200]  broadcasts or any videos you want to share or articles from freeworldnews.tv and let
[3:07:00.200 --> 3:07:05.200]  them ban that URL, I'm sure they will, they'll be in the news, they ban freeworldnews.tv
[3:07:05.200 --> 3:07:06.360]  and next week's debate.
[3:07:06.360 --> 3:07:11.680]  The bio pros are the new non-gmo pollution solution using eco-friendly products to treat
[3:07:11.680 --> 3:07:16.000]  everyday problems while supporting our environment, for the first time the bio pros are bringing

[3:08:03.320 --> 3:08:09.080]  for anaerobic septic tanks, thebiopros.com, one of the most common questions I get on
[3:08:09.080 --> 3:08:14.880]  there but also off here when I'm just out and about is, Alex, what do I say to my family
[3:08:14.880 --> 3:08:20.360]  about the vaccines, how do I warn them, well the problem is there's so many problems with
[3:08:20.360 --> 3:08:24.440]  it, so many facts, it's the history of contaminated vaccines, the fact that they have liability
[3:08:24.440 --> 3:08:29.160]  protection in the U.S. and Europe, the fact that they've been caught adding sterilants
[3:08:29.160 --> 3:08:34.360]  and cancer viruses and other things to vaccines, and the whole history of secret experimentation
[3:08:34.360 --> 3:08:39.120]  on at-risk groups of poor blacks, poor whites, Native Americans, the list goes on and on,
[3:08:39.120 --> 3:08:44.880]  but what about the fact that Fauci testified to Congress, and so did the head of the CDC
[3:08:44.880 --> 3:08:52.360]  in late May of 2021, that around half of the NIH CDC staff, medical doctors, neurologist,
[3:08:52.360 --> 3:08:56.240]  scientists have refused to take the vaccine until they can say, yeah, I think what half
[3:08:56.240 --> 3:09:00.280]  of the doctors are scared to take it, that's the same thing in the private practices out
[3:09:00.280 --> 3:09:04.600]  there, similar numbers, that that's not something I'm going to be taking, that's very, very simple,
[3:09:04.600 --> 3:09:09.160]  there's your answer.
[3:09:09.160 --> 3:09:15.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[3:09:15.360 --> 3:09:24.880]  All right, folks, this is the final segment I'm going to be hosting, Owen Schreuer is
[3:09:24.880 --> 3:09:30.240]  coming up with a big show for you in about 45 minutes, Matt Racken of EnemiesFarmToDomestic.com
[3:09:30.240 --> 3:09:35.360]  is about to take over, I always learn a lot listening and watching him, but if I seemed
[3:09:35.360 --> 3:09:39.440]  mad earlier, at the end of the last hour, it's not the crew, it's not you the listeners,
[3:09:39.440 --> 3:09:47.120]  I'm physically angry that they're putting known toxic chemicals that cause sterilization
[3:09:47.120 --> 3:09:52.400]  and death in the vaccine and admitting it, and then we try to cover the big tech blocks
[3:09:52.400 --> 3:09:57.720]  us, we're being raped, they should all go to prison, and if you look at big pharmaceutical
[3:09:57.720 --> 3:10:01.160]  companies have been caught hurting people on purpose over and over again because they're
[3:10:01.160 --> 3:10:07.040]  sickos, they're mad scientists, why would they inject black people with syphilis and
[3:10:07.040 --> 3:10:08.120]  poor white people?
[3:10:08.120 --> 3:10:09.480]  Why would they do all this?
[3:10:09.480 --> 3:10:13.080]  Because it's who they are, they want to play God, they want to kill a lot of people and
[3:10:13.080 --> 3:10:15.880]  they get off on it.
[3:10:15.880 --> 3:10:20.160]  And just like a pedophile will go try to be a school teacher, because that's where they
[3:10:20.160 --> 3:10:25.000]  can get a hold of school kids, well, mass murderers want to become Bill Gates, so they control
[3:10:25.000 --> 3:10:28.640]  the world medical system to do this, they believe to save the earth because they hate
[3:10:28.640 --> 3:10:32.240]  seeing all the development stuff, well I hate seeing over development, and there is some
[3:10:32.240 --> 3:10:35.880]  overpopulation, but you can't just go around and start murdering everybody because you
[3:10:35.880 --> 3:10:40.400]  want more room, you got to develop systems that build civilization, not destroy it.
[3:10:40.400 --> 3:10:44.240]  And again, Gates doesn't do all this because he actually cares about people, he doesn't
[3:10:44.240 --> 3:10:46.800]  because he's a sick freak.
[3:10:46.800 --> 3:10:51.520]  So again, let's put that lower third up there, because I just learned yesterday that this
[3:10:51.520 --> 3:10:57.640]  happened, I got really, really mad, we knew it was coming, we created Band.Video a few
[3:10:57.640 --> 3:11:02.600]  years ago, it exploded, then URL got banned on YouTube, banned on Twitter, banned all
[3:11:02.600 --> 3:11:07.240]  over, so you can't share it, well then we had a bunch of other URLs they banned, and
[3:11:07.240 --> 3:11:11.600]  then for like four months they didn't ban one, which is a long time, ban this.TV.
[3:11:11.600 --> 3:11:15.160]  After they stole the election and got Biden, they thought well, you know, but as soon as
[3:11:15.160 --> 3:11:20.080]  that site went viral, as soon as we were exposing all this stuff, they banned it yesterday morning,
[3:11:20.080 --> 3:11:24.480]  no one can share, ban this.TV, so now we're just going to abandon that, but it's a great
[3:11:24.480 --> 3:11:30.360]  system where it indexes all the same videos, all the same articles from Band.Video, it's
[3:11:30.360 --> 3:11:34.800]  just a different URL and different sub URLs, so whatever video it is, whatever live feed
[3:11:34.800 --> 3:11:40.440]  it is, you share FreeWorldNews.TV, and the reason I'm hyping this for our AM and FM stations,
[3:11:40.440 --> 3:11:45.200]  for our TV stations, promote their local URLs great as well, send the local URL of local
[3:11:45.200 --> 3:11:49.400]  stations because they're not being censored, and say hey, listen to this great radio lineup,
[3:11:49.400 --> 3:11:55.120]  we've got a lot of great people on this local station, send them to your friends and family
[3:11:55.120 --> 3:11:59.640]  that are outside of the listening area, use every system we've got as another lighthouse
[3:11:59.640 --> 3:12:05.040]  in the dark guiding in the ships of liberty, that's all this is about, so see the big debate
[3:12:05.040 --> 3:12:09.880]  on who's in the right, I think both sides have got some issues, with Israel and the whole
[3:12:09.880 --> 3:12:14.480]  Palestinian mess the globalists are using, Robert Barnes and Nick Pointes will debate
[3:12:14.480 --> 3:12:19.280]  this Tuesday, starting at about 6.30, I'll kick it off at 6, play some clips, talk about
[3:12:19.280 --> 3:12:22.000]  what's happened in the latest news, and then they're going to have an hour and a half free
[3:12:22.000 --> 3:12:27.640]  for all, you'll see a real debate, old fashioned debate, I'll just control the times, so don't
[3:12:27.640 --> 3:12:31.680]  worry it won't be normal loudmouth Alex that takes over, and then after that we'll have
[3:12:31.680 --> 3:12:37.120]  a commentary with Owen and Harrison Smith and whoever else wants to come in and give
[3:12:37.120 --> 3:12:45.160]  great commentary, so that is all coming up, but again, yes it's super good news that Texas
[3:12:45.160 --> 3:12:48.800]  is finally leading the way, Abbott that I've been so mad at, is always letting the Sanis
[3:12:48.800 --> 3:12:54.200]  lead the way, now comes out and says, don't wear mask, don't make them wear mask, or we're
[3:12:54.200 --> 3:12:58.080]  going to find you a thousand dollars, that's more like it, that's more constitutional to
[3:12:58.080 --> 3:13:00.960]  sit there and discriminate against people and say, don't show your dirty face, this
[3:13:00.960 --> 3:13:07.200]  is Sharia law, this is out of control, and we need that to be the model not just here
[3:13:07.200 --> 3:13:12.200]  but all over the world, because they're going to perfect the systems of lockdown and perfect
[3:13:12.200 --> 3:13:16.280]  the systems of control in other countries, and thank God, again I'm not bragging it's
[3:13:16.280 --> 3:13:20.960]  why we're so important, why you're so important as listeners, to get out people's comfort
[3:13:20.960 --> 3:13:24.840]  zone, we went down to the border in the last few months and showed the kids being loaded
[3:13:24.840 --> 3:13:29.200]  on planes, private planes, we went and showed them being put through the airports, through
[3:13:29.200 --> 3:13:34.000]  TSA, without being checked, so both through regular airports and at private airfields,
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:39.400]  now there's footage we shot of three buses pulling up and them doing it, now that's finally
[3:13:39.400 --> 3:13:44.000]  in Tennessee legislature is talking about it, Congress is talking about it, people are
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:51.120]  understanding what this is, so their last desperate system is the fear of bio attacks
[3:13:51.120 --> 3:13:57.120]  that they launch, and it's creating racial division, like Governor Lightfoot who says
[3:13:57.120 --> 3:14:00.600]  she's allowed to get a haircut but you can't, no matter what color you are, says no whites
[3:14:00.600 --> 3:14:04.720]  allowed, Jim Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot only takes interviews from black and brown
[3:14:04.720 --> 3:14:09.320]  reporters saying whites are inherently bad, she's told to do that by the big foundations
[3:14:09.320 --> 3:14:13.920]  for total control, oh and you've been doing a great job while you've been sitting in for
[3:14:13.920 --> 3:14:17.080]  me this week, I've been watching and listening, while I've been getting a lot of work done
[3:14:17.080 --> 3:14:20.560]  here in Florida which is the new epicenter of the resistance, I like to see Texas going
[3:14:20.560 --> 3:14:23.760]  back in that direction, because I want to see them both competing with each other for
[3:14:23.760 --> 3:14:29.240]  see which states can be the freest, and you know most pro-gun, most pro-family, but I like
[3:14:29.240 --> 3:14:32.720]  to see Abbott turn to pull his head out of his rear end, any closing comments you've
[3:14:32.720 --> 3:14:37.840]  got before you take back over in 45 minutes, I'm going to hand them a ton to Matt Bracken,
[3:14:37.840 --> 3:14:44.160]  well it's just hard to keep up with all the developments that are anti-human, anti-American,
[3:14:44.160 --> 3:14:48.520]  and I do think though people are awakening, but it gets worse, so it's just a matter of
[3:14:48.520 --> 3:14:53.040]  is the awakening going to reach a threshold to turn this thing around, or is the tyranny
[3:14:53.040 --> 3:14:56.960]  going to reach a threshold where we can't turn this thing around without some serious
[3:14:56.960 --> 3:14:57.960]  drastic physical violence.
[3:14:57.960 --> 3:15:01.720]  And what you just said is so central, and I know I'm interrupting, I've been ranting
[3:15:01.720 --> 3:15:06.520]  here, they know the jigs up, they know we've already woken up, they know the world's turning
[3:15:06.520 --> 3:15:09.240]  against them, they admit that in their own documents, so they're rushing to the finish
[3:15:09.240 --> 3:15:13.720]  line to just bring in martial law worldwide under the COVID tyranny and under racial
[3:15:13.720 --> 3:15:18.120]  division before we end up putting them all in prison, sorry go ahead.
[3:15:18.120 --> 3:15:22.480]  And I think it's beyond just, hey look here's Bill Gates or Ted Turner talking about how
[3:15:22.480 --> 3:15:26.560]  they want to get the human population down to zero, here's the Georgia guide stones that
[3:15:26.560 --> 3:15:32.400]  say maintain human population at 500 million, that means kill 99% of humans on planet earth,
[3:15:32.400 --> 3:15:37.360]  and then their philosophy that humanity is a virus, we're a parasite, we're a cancer,
[3:15:37.360 --> 3:15:41.000]  so we're just self aware now, so we need to kill ourselves, they won't off themselves,
[3:15:41.000 --> 3:15:42.680]  they just want everybody else to do it.
[3:15:42.680 --> 3:15:48.600]  But you know Alex, I think that at a certain level, we almost need to, not that we're in
[3:15:48.600 --> 3:15:53.680]  support of the New World Order philosophy, but it's like, it needs to be brought to
[3:15:53.680 --> 3:15:59.760]  the public, this philosophy that, hey look, you know, you should have every resource to
[3:15:59.760 --> 3:16:05.680]  understand and know that this vaccine, this COVID jab is experimental and potentially deadly,
[3:16:05.680 --> 3:16:12.200]  and if you walk in and you take it and you die, then you deserve it, that's their mentality,
[3:16:12.200 --> 3:16:13.200]  that's their experience.
[3:16:13.200 --> 3:16:16.360]  I totally agree, in fact, I've thought about taking only real quotes from the globalist
[3:16:16.360 --> 3:16:20.200]  and doing a whole show where I promote them to show people how sick it is, and to go downtown
[3:16:20.200 --> 3:16:24.400]  and tell the left, I want you to take more of these, because you're a leftist and I
[3:16:24.400 --> 3:16:29.240]  think you're a bad person, you shouldn't breed, I totally agree, using reverse psychology
[3:16:29.240 --> 3:16:33.240]  on them, skipping right to the end game and really presenting it all out in the open,
[3:16:33.240 --> 3:16:34.400]  which they've almost done.
[3:16:34.400 --> 3:16:38.040]  They always present it in a good like their New World Order, when we criticize it, they
[3:16:38.040 --> 3:16:39.280]  say it doesn't exist.
[3:16:39.280 --> 3:16:44.280]  We should just become super cheerleaders of it, not even satirical, but really show the
[3:16:44.280 --> 3:16:48.240]  full agenda and promote it, and under reverse psychology, folks will wake up.
[3:16:48.240 --> 3:16:53.400]  I'll be watching you today at 3 p.m. on with the War Room, great job my friend, all right.
[3:16:53.400 --> 3:16:58.400]  Matt Bracken takes over, Matt, I love it when you host every Thursday, sometimes on Wednesdays,
[3:16:58.400 --> 3:17:01.200]  and thanks for letting me still some time here today, Matt Bracken tells what you got
[3:17:01.200 --> 3:17:02.200]  coming up.
[3:17:02.200 --> 3:17:08.560]  Alex, it's all your time, believe me, I've been listening.
[3:17:08.560 --> 3:17:14.280]  I'm going to be talking mostly about the Civil War breaking out within the military.
[3:17:14.280 --> 3:17:21.360]  This book by Matthew Lohmeyer is a good starting point for that, but what you were talking
[3:17:21.360 --> 3:17:27.120]  about before with prison training, I'm going to talk about this a little bit.
[3:17:27.120 --> 3:17:32.320]  The psychologists have a term for it, learn helplessness.
[3:17:32.320 --> 3:17:36.760]  They did experiments with rats, where the rats just get randomly shocked whether they
[3:17:36.760 --> 3:17:41.320]  do a task or don't, until they just quit, and that's what we're getting.
[3:17:41.320 --> 3:17:45.320]  We're getting the rat shock treatment to where we just quit.
[3:17:45.320 --> 3:17:50.120]  Wear a mask, don't wear a mask, vaccines will kill you, vaccines will save you.
[3:17:50.120 --> 3:17:53.800]  They're just trying to beat us down like the lab rats.
[3:17:53.800 --> 3:18:00.700]  That's what's going on, and that's what I'll be talking about, and that in the Civil
[3:18:00.700 --> 3:18:06.000]  War than the military, coming up after the break.
[3:18:06.000 --> 3:18:11.400]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me, and it makes me feel pathetic,
[3:18:11.400 --> 3:18:16.640]  because I sit there and I beg you for support, constantly, for prayer, for financial support,
[3:18:16.640 --> 3:18:21.560]  and for word of mouth, and we're all in this together, and you know, it gets old having
[3:18:21.560 --> 3:18:25.240]  to come to you and say, hey, I got great products, please buy them, or we won't be here on air.
[3:18:25.240 --> 3:18:28.680]  But it's true, we're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty
[3:18:28.680 --> 3:18:33.320]  at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors, and they've harassed and
[3:18:33.320 --> 3:18:37.240]  almost shut down everybody else, they crippled all the other groups, and we're still here,
[3:18:37.240 --> 3:18:41.800]  and as this whole new world order comes out and be open, our credibility's going up.
[3:18:41.800 --> 3:18:45.400]  That's why we've got to be taken off air, that's why America has got to be taken down.
[3:18:45.400 --> 3:18:49.800]  You can't have all these other nations enslaved, and America's still quasi-free.
[3:18:49.800 --> 3:18:53.720]  You can't have info wars has been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's
[3:18:53.720 --> 3:18:58.360]  about to unfold, because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready, so thank you all,
[3:18:58.360 --> 3:19:02.480]  and get an infowarstore.com, get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements and so much
[3:19:02.480 --> 3:19:07.000]  more, they're wonderful products, and they support the info, we're thanking you.
[3:19:07.000 --> 3:19:10.360]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left.
[3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:14.680]  It can be very stressful dealing with facts you refuse to accept.
[3:19:14.680 --> 3:19:19.400]  If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental condition, buy them
[3:19:19.400 --> 3:19:23.880]  a bottle of ultimate fish oil from infowarstore.com.
[3:19:23.880 --> 3:19:28.680]  Studies have suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower
[3:19:28.680 --> 3:19:34.440]  blood pressure, decrease triglyceride levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque, and provide
[3:19:34.440 --> 3:19:40.440]  a soothing reduction in inflammatory responses in joints and the digestive system.
[3:19:40.440 --> 3:19:47.060]  Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA fish oil can stimulate immune function
[3:19:47.060 --> 3:19:51.640]  by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[3:19:51.640 --> 3:19:57.560]  It worked for my family, and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual
[3:19:57.560 --> 3:20:00.240]  facts that pertain to reality.
[3:20:00.240 --> 3:20:09.240]  Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member, or yourself at infowarstore.com.
[3:20:09.240 --> 3:20:11.240]  Your voice counts.
[3:20:11.240 --> 3:20:16.240]  When you share information, be it over the internet or in person, it changes the world.
[3:20:16.240 --> 3:20:18.840]  The globalists know their agenda is unpopular.
[3:20:18.840 --> 3:20:20.360]  They know you're angry.
[3:20:20.360 --> 3:20:24.680]  And now to get around big tech, it's more important than ever that we use every tool
[3:20:24.680 --> 3:20:25.680]  we've got.

[3:21:07.320 --> 3:21:12.600]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting
[3:21:12.600 --> 3:21:18.560]  patients, hundreds of hospitals in the U.S., injected healthy men, women, and children
[3:21:18.560 --> 3:21:24.840]  with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing
[3:21:24.840 --> 3:21:26.680]  many of the test subjects.
[3:21:26.680 --> 3:21:31.240]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made.
[3:21:31.240 --> 3:21:35.040]  Fourteen years ago, we tracked and documented the Bilderberg Group's activities, and they're
[3:21:35.040 --> 3:21:38.360]  planned for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[3:21:38.360 --> 3:21:39.920]  The film now is more important than ever.
[3:21:39.920 --> 3:21:42.800]  When it shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[3:21:42.800 --> 3:21:48.760]  We have it back in print, available now at infowarstore.com, selling them as low as $3.95
[3:21:48.760 --> 3:21:49.760]  apiece.
[3:21:49.760 --> 3:21:52.720]  We have I'm in bulk, and there's a zero country code, so anywhere on the planet, you can make
[3:21:52.720 --> 3:21:53.720]  copies.
[3:21:53.720 --> 3:21:54.720]  In fact, I want you to make copies.
[3:21:54.720 --> 3:22:00.680]  You are the Paul Revere's, 1776 Worldwide, 1776 Worldwide, in-game blueprint for global
[3:22:00.680 --> 3:22:27.800]  enslavement, available now at infowarstore.com.
[3:22:27.800 --> 3:22:48.200]  For the rest of the hour, I'm going to mostly be speaking about a civil war that's breaking
[3:22:48.200 --> 3:22:49.800]  out within the military.
[3:22:49.800 --> 3:22:58.240]  At this point, this war is just political and rhetorical, but it could very easily break
[3:22:58.240 --> 3:23:06.320]  into something kinetic at some point, because the lines are being clearly divided right
[3:23:06.320 --> 3:23:16.520]  now between the Marxists and their allied cowards who are summertime patriots who all
[3:23:16.520 --> 3:23:23.120]  took an oath to defend the Constitution, but right now they're hiding under their desks,
[3:23:23.120 --> 3:23:31.080]  running for cover, found in the locker room or the bathroom when the call to action is
[3:23:31.080 --> 3:23:41.200]  being sounded, versus the Marxists, the Communists, who are currently in charge of our military.
[3:23:41.200 --> 3:23:47.600]  And I don't say that lightly, everybody that ever joined the military takes an oath.
[3:23:47.600 --> 3:23:52.560]  They don't swear to defend the Fatherland, they don't swear to defend the President,
[3:23:52.560 --> 3:23:58.400]  the White House, they don't swear even to defend the borders of the country, they swear
[3:23:58.400 --> 3:24:07.080]  to defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign, and domestic.
[3:24:07.080 --> 3:24:12.400]  That was put in right at the beginning at the time of the writing of the Constitution,
[3:24:12.400 --> 3:24:18.480]  because our forefathers understood that threats weren't just going to come from overseas,
[3:24:18.480 --> 3:24:20.440]  from foreign enemies.
[3:24:20.440 --> 3:24:30.840]  They knew that this experiment, this concept of a country founded on God-given rights delineated
[3:24:30.840 --> 3:24:39.760]  for us in the Constitution, which is just this little tiny book, okay, compared to any
[3:24:39.760 --> 3:24:46.320]  of these omnibus spending bills that are where they're going to spend trillions of dollars
[3:24:46.320 --> 3:24:53.000]  we don't have, that they're going to print digitally and theoretically borrow from one
[3:24:53.000 --> 3:24:58.960]  pocket to put in the other pocket, kind of an idiot's shell game.
[3:24:58.960 --> 3:25:02.840]  This is what we swore to defend, the Constitution.
[3:25:02.840 --> 3:25:11.120]  When you have the bosses of the military who are sold out globalist communists, they're
[3:25:11.120 --> 3:25:18.920]  now saying, if you talk about defending the Constitution, you'll be demoted, you'll be
[3:25:18.920 --> 3:25:22.280]  relieved for cause from your job.
[3:25:22.280 --> 3:25:30.000]  This is the situation that Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Lohmeyer finds himself in.
[3:25:30.000 --> 3:25:38.040]  A few months ago, the Secretary of Defense, Lloyd Austin, he put out a call to see something,
[3:25:38.040 --> 3:25:39.040]  say something.
[3:25:39.040 --> 3:25:43.600]  Let's root out the extremism within the military.
[3:25:43.600 --> 3:25:52.640]  What he noticed were these mandatory classes teaching Marxism under the guise of Black
[3:25:52.640 --> 3:25:59.280]  Lives Matter and their diversity, inclusion, and equity program.
[3:25:59.280 --> 3:26:01.480]  They're teaching Marxism.
[3:26:01.480 --> 3:26:10.080]  Part of the classes teach our troops that the Constitution is an outdated racist document
[3:26:10.080 --> 3:26:17.280]  made by slave owners to preserve slavery and to preserve white oppression over blacks
[3:26:17.280 --> 3:26:18.880]  and minorities.
[3:26:18.880 --> 3:26:24.000]  That's what troops in the military are being taught today.
[3:26:24.000 --> 3:26:31.320]  The same troops that all raised their hand and swore a solemn oath to defend the Constitution,
[3:26:31.320 --> 3:26:36.640]  the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[3:26:36.640 --> 3:26:46.000]  Now these domestic enemies, these traitors, have by stealth snuck into the very top positions.
[3:26:46.000 --> 3:26:49.120]  They're now making policy.
[3:26:49.120 --> 3:26:56.640]  They're relieving for cause patriots like Lieutenant Colonel Matthew Lohmeyer, and they're promoting
[3:26:56.640 --> 3:26:59.600]  other stealth Marxists.
[3:26:59.600 --> 3:27:03.880]  One of them is this guy, Lloyd Austin.
[3:27:03.880 --> 3:27:11.840]  He was a general, but his primary position was putting a happy black face on the invasion
[3:27:11.840 --> 3:27:12.840]  of Iraq.
[3:27:12.840 --> 3:27:15.640]  He's a stooge and a yes man.
[3:27:15.640 --> 3:27:20.200]  After he retired from the military, what did Lloyd Austin do?
[3:27:20.200 --> 3:27:27.000]  He went to work for Raytheon and Newcore and big health conglomerates where he could be
[3:27:27.000 --> 3:27:33.000]  paid millions to put his signature on these globalist schemes.
[3:27:33.000 --> 3:27:37.480]  So who do they call in to be the head of the Department of Defense?
[3:27:37.480 --> 3:27:38.980]  Lloyd Austin.
[3:27:38.980 --> 3:27:41.160]  What's his first action?
[3:27:41.160 --> 3:27:45.080]  Declaring that white racists are the big problem in the military.
[3:27:45.080 --> 3:27:48.680]  They're going to root out the white extremists.
[3:27:48.680 --> 3:27:51.360]  That's what's going on right now.
[3:27:51.360 --> 3:27:57.920]  Critical race theory, which is a foreign enemy import from Europe, that was the Frankfurt
[3:27:57.920 --> 3:28:05.480]  School in Germany, they brought it to America and adapted it as critical race theory because
[3:28:05.480 --> 3:28:09.880]  class warfare wasn't effective in the United States.
[3:28:09.880 --> 3:28:11.760]  We had too big of a middle class.
[3:28:11.760 --> 3:28:13.800]  Most Americans were too happy.
[3:28:13.800 --> 3:28:20.760]  So the critical school, the critical theory, went against the racial divide in the country
[3:28:20.760 --> 3:28:22.680]  as our weak point.
[3:28:22.680 --> 3:28:24.640]  It's a communist tactic.
[3:28:24.640 --> 3:28:26.760]  I don't call it critical race theory.
[3:28:26.760 --> 3:28:29.640]  I call it communist race tactic.
[3:28:29.640 --> 3:28:34.840]  Now you see the pyramid that's up on the screen right now.
[3:28:34.840 --> 3:28:38.920]  We're wondering always how does this happen?
[3:28:38.920 --> 3:28:45.640]  How are we being ruled when most Americans don't agree with this communist race tactic
[3:28:45.640 --> 3:28:53.880]  when we don't want stealth Marxists running our politics and now even running our military?
[3:28:53.880 --> 3:28:54.880]  How does it happen?
[3:28:54.880 --> 3:29:02.920]  Well, at the very top, I think in my own opinion, there are pure evil satanic forces.
[3:29:02.920 --> 3:29:09.640]  There is a small percentage of psychopaths, sociopaths that are very intelligent, very
[3:29:09.640 --> 3:29:17.800]  successful, and they have an enormous amount of power, and they are using the next tier
[3:29:17.800 --> 3:29:21.960]  down which are the dedicated communist revolutionaries.
[3:29:21.960 --> 3:29:27.720]  They empower these communist revolutionaries and make sure that they're promoted.
[3:29:27.720 --> 3:29:33.160]  This is how people like John Brennan wind up as the head of the CIA.
[3:29:33.160 --> 3:29:39.040]  This is how somebody like Barack Obama becomes the president of the United States.
[3:29:39.040 --> 3:29:43.080]  The next tier down, you have just cultural Marxists.
[3:29:43.080 --> 3:29:48.800]  They might not understand Marx and Engels and the communist manifesto, but they're all
[3:29:48.800 --> 3:29:57.840]  in on transgenderism, on teaching children about gay rights and kindergarten.
[3:29:57.840 --> 3:30:04.040]  Just everything that will divide this country, they basically hate Western civilization and
[3:30:04.040 --> 3:30:11.200]  anything that upends the society that's been built in this country for centuries and in
[3:30:11.200 --> 3:30:16.920]  Western civilization for a couple thousand years, they want to smash it.
[3:30:16.920 --> 3:30:20.640]  The next tier down are the useful idiots.
[3:30:20.640 --> 3:30:28.880]  These are just the folks on the sofa ingesting the Netflix, just total entertainment all
[3:30:28.880 --> 3:30:30.240]  the time.
[3:30:30.240 --> 3:30:35.920]  They see what's mostly on television, they go along with it, but we're at the bottom.
[3:30:35.920 --> 3:30:38.840]  We're the normal people trapped at the bottom.
[3:30:38.840 --> 3:30:41.360]  We have the numbers.
[3:30:41.360 --> 3:30:46.880]  How is it that a smaller group of people is managing to hold us down?
[3:30:46.880 --> 3:30:52.640]  It's because they've beaten us down to thinking that there's nothing we can do, that it's
[3:30:52.640 --> 3:30:54.840]  a fate accompli.
[3:30:54.840 --> 3:31:03.280]  This is where I'd like to talk just a little bit before the break about this learned helplessness.
[3:31:03.280 --> 3:31:08.080]  Psychologists figured this out doing experiments with rats, starting in the 50s, rats and
[3:31:08.080 --> 3:31:09.080]  other animals.
[3:31:09.080 --> 3:31:15.040]  If you put them in the cage, you had them do tasks, they got rewards, they got food pellets,
[3:31:15.040 --> 3:31:16.560]  sometimes they get shocked.
[3:31:16.560 --> 3:31:22.480]  They found out if the shocks were randomized, eventually the rats would just become apathetic.
[3:31:22.480 --> 3:31:27.840]  They wouldn't keep trying to figure out an impossible way to jump from safe space to
[3:31:27.840 --> 3:31:29.120]  safe space.
[3:31:29.120 --> 3:31:32.400]  They just figured, what the hell, I'm going to get shocked.
[3:31:32.400 --> 3:31:36.560]  I might as well just lay here and just wait for the next shock.
[3:31:36.560 --> 3:31:41.160]  We are the lab rats in this giant social experiment.
[3:31:41.160 --> 3:31:47.920]  They're counting on our apathy, they're counting on us quitting and just laying in our corner
[3:31:47.920 --> 3:31:54.120]  and accepting that the Satanic forces and the Communist revolutionaries will be able
[3:31:54.120 --> 3:31:58.680]  to leverage their power and hold us down and control us forever.
[3:31:58.680 --> 3:32:05.160]  On the other side of the break, I'm going to talk about how we can flip this script
[3:32:05.160 --> 3:32:06.160]  and turn it around.
[3:32:06.160 --> 3:32:11.440]  Let's show them what a real alpha male looks like with one of our most powerful products

[3:34:05.200 --> 3:34:07.360]  Listen up, Patriots.
[3:34:07.360 --> 3:34:11.640]  I'm running a sale that's the biggest I've ever run on three products that are already
[3:34:11.640 --> 3:34:12.640]  selling out.
[3:34:12.640 --> 3:34:17.080]  Well, then why am I selling it then at 50% off or 60% off depending on which sale you
[3:34:17.080 --> 3:34:20.680]  go with because I know a lot of you are on the fence, you haven't tried it and I know
[3:34:20.680 --> 3:34:22.320]  you're going to get hooked once you do.
[3:34:22.320 --> 3:34:29.160]  So for one week only, we're running 50% off on ultimate fish oil, 50% off on winter sun
[3:34:29.160 --> 3:34:33.640]  with D3 and cave free immune system, and oh my gosh, people love this so much but sold
[3:34:33.640 --> 3:34:39.440]  out for months back in limited supply, turbo force, 10 hour clean energy is 40% off.
[3:34:39.440 --> 3:34:45.360]  But you can get them all three together in the optimum trifecta pack for 60% off.
[3:34:45.360 --> 3:34:47.840]  We've never offered that on these products.
[3:34:47.840 --> 3:34:49.040]  It's basically a lost leader.
[3:34:49.040 --> 3:34:50.040]  I want you to get them.
[3:34:50.040 --> 3:34:51.040]  I want you to try them.
[3:34:51.040 --> 3:34:52.040]  I want you to love them.
[3:34:52.040 --> 3:34:53.040]  I want you to believe me.
[3:34:53.040 --> 3:34:54.040]  You're going to be a blown away.
[3:34:54.040 --> 3:34:55.040]  Go to infowarstore.com.
[3:34:55.040 --> 3:34:59.920]  We're running this Monday through Sunday and the deal is over.
[3:34:59.920 --> 3:35:00.920]  Best deal ever.
[3:35:00.920 --> 3:35:06.760]  Take advantage of it at infowarstore.com and fund the info war.
[3:35:06.760 --> 3:35:12.120]  Bio remediation is a process used to treat contaminating water, soil and subsurface material
[3:35:12.120 --> 3:35:16.560]  by accelerating naturally occurring environmental conditions to stimulate growth of microorganisms
[3:35:16.560 --> 3:35:18.520]  and degrade targeted pollutants.
[3:35:18.520 --> 3:35:23.600]  For the first time, the bio pros are bringing to the public market a suite of bio remediation
[3:35:23.600 --> 3:35:25.640]  products to the everyday consumer.
[3:35:25.640 --> 3:35:30.320]  Their first product they are launching is called bioseptic pro, a product specifically
[3:35:30.320 --> 3:35:33.320]  designed to establish a healthy septic system.
[3:35:33.320 --> 3:35:37.680]  Bio septic pro contains live microorganisms, not traditional enzymes like its competitors.
[3:35:37.680 --> 3:35:39.600]  This stuff lives in your septic system.
[3:35:39.600 --> 3:35:44.680]  It's really like probiotics for your septic tank and is at least 100 times more effective
[3:35:44.680 --> 3:35:49.440]  than similar microbial products due to its revolutionary patented delivery system.
[3:35:49.440 --> 3:35:53.920]  Bio septic pro contains no chemical ingredients and no genetically modified organisms.
[3:35:53.920 --> 3:35:57.920]  Visit thebiopros.com today and protect your septic system.
[3:35:57.920 --> 3:35:59.920]  That's thebiopros.com.
[3:35:59.920 --> 3:36:09.800]  This is for anaerobic septic tanks and the job it does is unparalleled, thebiopros.com.
[3:36:09.800 --> 3:36:28.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:36:28.440 --> 3:36:34.040]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:36:34.040 --> 3:36:36.720]  It's Matt Bracken.
[3:36:36.720 --> 3:36:45.640]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:36:45.640 --> 3:36:52.840]  This experiment and learn helplessness, it has profound implications and people really
[3:36:52.840 --> 3:36:55.120]  need to understand it.
[3:36:55.120 --> 3:37:01.160]  It's related to Stockholm syndrome and an entire society can be beaten into submission
[3:37:01.160 --> 3:37:06.760]  and suffer a form of Stockholm syndrome where you're just glad to finally get permission
[3:37:06.760 --> 3:37:08.320]  to take off your mask.
[3:37:08.320 --> 3:37:09.520]  Thank you, master.
[3:37:09.520 --> 3:37:10.520]  Thank you.
[3:37:10.520 --> 3:37:15.200]  You'll kiss the hand of your slave master.
[3:37:15.200 --> 3:37:20.000]  In the plains Indian wars, we learned a lot about this.
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:26.280]  We didn't really understand the terminology at the time, but the Comanches and the Apaches,
[3:37:26.280 --> 3:37:27.280]  this was common.
[3:37:27.280 --> 3:37:33.000]  It was done to hundreds of children in Texas and the Southwest in particular.
[3:37:33.000 --> 3:37:41.320]  When a farmstead was raided or settlers and wagons were attacked, if they captured children
[3:37:41.320 --> 3:37:46.880]  between the ages of 7 and 13, they wouldn't kill them.
[3:37:46.880 --> 3:37:47.880]  They would keep them.
[3:37:47.880 --> 3:37:53.520]  No matter how brutally they were treated, beaten, tortured, they would eventually become
[3:37:53.520 --> 3:37:58.760]  Stockholm syndrome to that tribe that had captured them.
[3:37:58.760 --> 3:38:04.920]  Even children that had seen their parents murdered or killed in raids, these children
[3:38:04.920 --> 3:38:10.560]  eventually would become just like the Comanches that had captured them.
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:15.160]  This was a big mystery to the American settlers in the Southwest.
[3:38:15.160 --> 3:38:16.880]  How could this happen?
[3:38:16.880 --> 3:38:21.000]  When these children were discovered and they were brought back to their families, they
[3:38:21.000 --> 3:38:24.480]  would repeatedly try to escape back to the Indians.
[3:38:24.480 --> 3:38:29.400]  These were children who had been kidnapped and often saw their own parents and siblings
[3:38:29.400 --> 3:38:31.640]  murdered.
[3:38:31.640 --> 3:38:38.600]  This is a syndrome which can be exploited by evil people, by the top level of the globalists,
[3:38:38.600 --> 3:38:41.080]  those satanic forces.
[3:38:41.080 --> 3:38:48.800]  They know if they just beat us down long enough, like the prisoner in some gulag, will eventually
[3:38:48.800 --> 3:38:55.840]  be grateful when the guard throws in a double ration of bread scraps, will actually have
[3:38:55.840 --> 3:38:59.360]  a good feeling in our heart for the guard.
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:04.600]  This is what happens when they start relaxing the mask mandate.
[3:39:04.600 --> 3:39:11.640]  It is part of prison training and we have to resist it.
[3:39:11.640 --> 3:39:17.880]  In that pyramid meme that I showed, we have the numbers at the bottom.
[3:39:17.880 --> 3:39:23.320]  The useful idiots and the cultural Marxists, they are just a buffer between us and the
[3:39:23.320 --> 3:39:29.880]  real enemies who are the communist traders and the pure evil satanists at the top.
[3:39:29.880 --> 3:39:35.240]  The useful idiots and the sheeple and the cultural Marxists, they are just filler, they
[3:39:35.240 --> 3:39:36.680]  are like cannon fodders.
[3:39:36.680 --> 3:39:41.000]  They are just a buffer to keep us from getting at our main enemies.
[3:39:41.000 --> 3:39:47.480]  But we have seen recently how by taking power, taking action at the local level, you can
[3:39:47.480 --> 3:39:50.520]  actually have very strong results.
[3:39:50.520 --> 3:39:56.040]  We have seen these school board meetings where parents have gone in force and just started
[3:39:56.040 --> 3:40:04.280]  demanding an end to the masking, demanding an end to the CRT, communist, race tactic.
[3:40:04.280 --> 3:40:05.840]  Just demanding it.
[3:40:05.840 --> 3:40:08.360]  We can't do much at the federal level.
[3:40:08.360 --> 3:40:10.120]  That is out of our reach.
[3:40:10.120 --> 3:40:14.320]  But we can start pushing up from the bottom of that pyramid.
[3:40:14.320 --> 3:40:22.440]  According to local political events, in numbers, the left has always understood this, a small
[3:40:22.440 --> 3:40:29.440]  number of loud cultural Marxists and useful idiots can make the school boards and other
[3:40:29.440 --> 3:40:33.560]  local politicians think, this is the big crowd.
[3:40:33.560 --> 3:40:34.560]  No, it's not.
[3:40:34.560 --> 3:40:36.360]  We are the big crowd.
[3:40:36.360 --> 3:40:39.440]  But we are too content to sit at home.
[3:40:39.440 --> 3:40:46.240]  We need to get out and force our will because these useful idiots and cultural Marxists,
[3:40:46.240 --> 3:40:48.080]  they are not strong.
[3:40:48.080 --> 3:40:54.960]  You just plow right through them and aim your arrows at the actual communists.
[3:40:54.960 --> 3:40:57.800]  Now, they don't call themselves communists.
[3:40:57.800 --> 3:41:04.440]  They call themselves progressives, democratic socialists, they are communists.
[3:41:04.440 --> 3:41:11.160]  They only don't put a hammer and sickle on their web page and their lapel for the moment
[3:41:11.160 --> 3:41:14.440]  because it still has some negative implications.
[3:41:14.440 --> 3:41:16.720]  But you know them by their fruits.
[3:41:16.720 --> 3:41:23.800]  They are the same people that constantly praise every communist regime and forgive every communist
[3:41:23.800 --> 3:41:26.040]  atrocity and mass murder.
[3:41:26.040 --> 3:41:35.760]  They are communists, just because a wolf is wearing a sheep's clothing disguise, it's
[3:41:35.760 --> 3:41:37.440]  still a wolf.
[3:41:37.440 --> 3:41:42.200]  You don't wait for them to declare that they're a communist and put on a hat with the hammer
[3:41:42.200 --> 3:41:45.120]  and sickle, otherwise you're just a sucker.
[3:41:45.120 --> 3:41:49.920]  You're like a sheep that's believing that the wolf in sheep's clothing is actually
[3:41:49.920 --> 3:41:55.040]  a sheep because it sneaks up to you and says, don't worry, I'm just a sheep.
[3:41:55.040 --> 3:41:57.760]  You have to see them for what they are.
[3:41:57.760 --> 3:41:58.920]  We have the numbers.
[3:41:58.920 --> 3:42:00.520]  We can push back.
[3:42:00.520 --> 3:42:08.280]  Now there's a few areas where there are just clear lines of delineation and these are very
[3:42:08.280 --> 3:42:09.280]  helpful.
[3:42:09.280 --> 3:42:13.640]  If you remember these, you'll be able to share them with your family and friends because these
[3:42:13.640 --> 3:42:15.840]  are extremely effective.
[3:42:15.840 --> 3:42:22.200]  Now, for everybody that's been in the military, every single one of us remembers that we took
[3:42:22.200 --> 3:42:30.360]  an oath, we swore to defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic.
[3:42:30.360 --> 3:42:33.680]  Start with this lesson and let it spread.
[3:42:33.680 --> 3:42:41.480]  Has this been superseded by we now take an oath to Marxism, to stealth communism?
[3:42:41.480 --> 3:42:48.240]  If the military is being trained in stealth Marxism, that they're being trained that the
[3:42:48.240 --> 3:42:58.120]  Constitution needs to be torn up and thrown out, that it's an old racist document of oppressors,
[3:42:58.120 --> 3:43:03.160]  this is a direct conflict with the oath that every member of the military takes.
[3:43:03.160 --> 3:43:07.840]  So at any chance that you get, put these people on the spot.
[3:43:07.840 --> 3:43:16.200]  If you could ask Lloyd Austin today, Mr. Austin, General Austin, has that oath been superseded?
[3:43:16.200 --> 3:43:22.680]  You're teaching the troops to get rid of the Constitution that they swore an oath to defend.
[3:43:22.680 --> 3:43:25.960]  Which is it, General Austin?
[3:43:25.960 --> 3:43:29.480]  Is it still the Constitution that we swear to defend?
[3:43:29.480 --> 3:43:34.360]  Or is it cultural Marxism, critical race theory?
[3:43:34.360 --> 3:43:35.360]  Which is it?
[3:43:35.360 --> 3:43:38.560]  It can't be both.
[3:43:38.560 --> 3:43:42.600]  Another area that's really easy for people to understand.
[3:43:42.600 --> 3:43:48.680]  In the Constitution, Article 4, Section 4 says that the United States shall guarantee
[3:43:48.680 --> 3:43:56.360]  to every state a Republican form of government, that just means not Republican Party, just
[3:43:56.360 --> 3:44:04.840]  a Republican form of government, and shall protect each of them against invasion.
[3:44:04.840 --> 3:44:11.080]  If the United States, the federal government is expediting an invasion, if they're bringing
[3:44:11.080 --> 3:44:18.520]  buses to the border to take MS-13 straight into every city, bringing fentanyl in their
[3:44:18.520 --> 3:44:23.960]  backpacks, they are not defending the states against invasion.
[3:44:23.960 --> 3:44:27.600]  You can say, Mr. Bracken, those are just children.
[3:44:27.600 --> 3:44:34.240]  Every 13-year-old boy, as far as I'm concerned, is 17 or 18 because we've seen the data.
[3:44:34.240 --> 3:44:36.000]  They have no papers.
[3:44:36.000 --> 3:44:38.840]  Every 18-year-old is probably 25.
[3:44:38.840 --> 3:44:45.720]  These are fighting age men being brought in by the thousands and let off in every American
[3:44:45.720 --> 3:44:52.960]  city to reinforce the cartel gangs that are already in our cities.
[3:44:52.960 --> 3:44:57.560]  And the lesson of this to all the gangs, anybody that would be fighting the gangs, is there's
[3:44:57.560 --> 3:44:59.280]  no point in fighting.
[3:44:59.280 --> 3:45:05.400]  Your own government is bringing in as many of these gangsters as they can.
[3:45:05.400 --> 3:45:12.280]  So quit fighting it because your own federal government has sold you out.
[3:45:12.280 --> 3:45:21.640]  And this is something that it just pisses me off to no end that this is happening.
[3:45:21.640 --> 3:45:28.040]  So get in the face of people at your local school boards, fight back, and at any chance
[3:45:28.040 --> 3:45:36.120]  you can, any chance you get, ask, is our oath to defend the Constitution still valid?
[3:45:36.120 --> 3:45:39.200]  Or are we just a communist country now?
[3:45:39.200 --> 3:45:40.640]  Put them on the spot.
[3:45:40.640 --> 3:45:41.880]  Don't be shy about this.
[3:45:41.880 --> 3:45:45.240]  We took an oath to defend the Constitution.
[3:45:45.240 --> 3:45:52.000]  Does the federal government have a responsibility to protect the states from invasion or not?
[3:45:52.000 --> 3:45:57.720]  As far as I'm concerned, they're in abrogation of a contract.
[3:45:57.720 --> 3:46:02.600]  If they don't have to obey that law, if they're bringing gangsters into our cities, why should
[3:46:02.600 --> 3:46:04.000]  we pay taxes?
[3:46:04.000 --> 3:46:06.880]  Why should we obey any gun law?
[3:46:06.880 --> 3:46:10.640]  Why should we give a damn about their vaccines?
[3:46:10.640 --> 3:46:14.360]  And for God's sakes, don't take the vaccine.
[3:46:14.360 --> 3:46:17.880]  It's an experimental gene therapy.
[3:46:17.880 --> 3:46:25.640]  And this is another good point to tell people, look, if your employer says you have to take
[3:46:25.640 --> 3:46:33.720]  this vaccine, print out some boilerplate legal document saying, I will accept all responsibilities
[3:46:33.720 --> 3:46:38.360]  for any side effects for any period of time in the future.
[3:46:38.360 --> 3:46:44.120]  See if your employer will sign that before they force you to take the vaccine.
[3:46:44.120 --> 3:46:46.000]  Don't take the vaccine.
[3:46:46.000 --> 3:46:48.760]  Don't be a lab rat in their experiment.
[3:46:48.760 --> 3:46:52.720]  We'll continue this next week.
[3:46:52.720 --> 3:46:56.880]  God willing.
