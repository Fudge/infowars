[00:00.000 --> 00:12.040]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.040 --> 00:39.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:39.160 --> 00:47.400]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this live 26 day of
[00:47.400 --> 00:54.000]  August's transmission we are going to be here for the next three hours
[00:54.000 --> 00:59.560]  broadcasting worldwide there has obviously been a dramatic horrifying
[00:59.560 --> 01:09.560]  murder caught in Virginia on a live TV feed of a reporter and a cameraman by a
[01:09.560 --> 01:17.920]  disgruntled employee or former employee who had been involved in racism lawsuits
[01:17.920 --> 01:23.360]  at another TV station in Florida we have the research up on info wars.com he is
[01:23.360 --> 01:28.240]  now reportedly just committed suicide the last 10 minutes he goes by the name
[01:28.240 --> 01:35.960]  Bryce Williams but his real name is Vester Flanagan and he reportedly the
[01:35.960 --> 01:41.520]  police say turn the gun on himself after a dramatic chase this is just like the
[01:41.520 --> 01:45.480]  Charleston shooting that killed nine people who are a racist whacked out
[01:45.480 --> 01:49.640]  white person who thought a race war was beginning was trying to start a race
[01:49.640 --> 01:55.240]  war helter skelter style went in and killed those people this gentleman says
[01:55.240 --> 01:59.800]  that there was racism at this TV station because he hadn't been promoted he has
[01:59.800 --> 02:06.320]  been tweeting that out and he wanted to be an anchor on TV I mean the guy looks
[02:06.320 --> 02:10.160]  completely whacked out he doesn't look like he could be a janitor at a TV
[02:10.160 --> 02:15.480]  station much less a anchor at a TV station and I'm just telling you that as a
[02:15.480 --> 02:20.320]  TV radio guy he looks completely out of his mind in his Twitter photos and stuff
[02:20.320 --> 02:26.600]  from weeks ago and he shot these people on live television and we have footage
[02:26.600 --> 02:31.520]  that Fox seeing in others aren't showing I'm gonna play it here because this is a
[02:31.520 --> 02:36.520]  culture loves violence well it's nothing compared to shoot them up games and he
[02:36.520 --> 02:40.280]  shot this footage I guess wanting to be famous with his cell phone I guess an
[02:40.280 --> 02:45.760]  iPhone or droid in first-person point of view with the gun out in front of him
[02:45.760 --> 02:49.440]  just like the video game doom developed by the Pentagon to get people to
[02:49.440 --> 02:54.400]  dehumanize folks and shoot them I'm not demonizing video games I'm just saying
[02:54.400 --> 02:58.960]  that's what this culture is and so many times these people are obsessed with
[02:58.960 --> 03:03.480]  shoot them up video games turns out the guy from the Charleston situation was
[03:03.480 --> 03:07.360]  almost all the mass shooters they're almost always on psychotropics or
[03:07.360 --> 03:11.440]  amnesics which we predicted with the Charleston situation turned out he was
[03:11.440 --> 03:17.520]  if this guy wasn't seeing a psychologist or psychiatrist I'll eat my hat it's all
[03:17.520 --> 03:24.200]  it takes to get rid of the inhibition and send people over the edge in a big
[03:24.200 --> 03:31.160]  big way so we are going to be breaking all of this down but right now let's go
[03:31.160 --> 03:35.880]  to the footage that he was uploading live to Twitter they've taken down the
[03:35.880 --> 03:40.320]  Twitter account we've saved all of his tweets one of his last tweets was
[03:40.320 --> 03:50.040]  Allison made racist comments and EEOC filed a report so he filed a report with
[03:50.040 --> 03:57.320]  the EEOC that will try to find a business for turn of the lights on I
[03:57.320 --> 04:03.200]  mean it's an unbelievable organization of my view unconstitutional but don't
[04:03.200 --> 04:13.280]  worry he filed it with them and he was exposing her her her racism and now how
[04:13.280 --> 04:19.080]  is the controlled left on CNN MSNBC that's been pushing organizations and
[04:19.080 --> 04:22.640]  groups saying kill the cops kill the white people all these tweets we reported
[04:22.640 --> 04:26.040]  on thousands of folks saying time start killing crackers and don't worry
[04:26.040 --> 04:28.520]  crackers are getting shot they're getting beat up they're getting killed they're
[04:28.520 --> 04:31.920]  getting robbed they're getting beat up in church it's okay because they're white
[04:31.920 --> 04:37.920]  so will this be defended that he says she was racist no judge no jury she gets
[04:37.920 --> 04:41.400]  executed so does the so does the cameraman because they're trying to blame
[04:41.400 --> 04:44.680]  the Second Amendment right now this is the next big push but they've got a
[04:44.680 --> 04:51.280]  problem a big problem because this guy is basically a creation and was
[04:51.280 --> 04:56.040]  guaranteed pushed over the edge by the mainstream media inciting all of this I
[04:56.040 --> 05:02.200]  mean they're guilty the United States has called in airstrikes to stop the
[05:02.200 --> 05:07.040]  Taliban from taking control of opium fields in Afghanistan over the weekend
[05:07.040 --> 05:11.320]  the airstrikes were called in after the Taliban seized weapons and vehicles from
[05:11.320 --> 05:15.920]  Afghan soldiers hellman province is said to be one of the world's largest
[05:15.920 --> 05:20.400]  opium producing regions larger than the whole of Burma which is the second
[05:20.400 --> 05:25.480]  largest producer of opium production of opium reached an all-time high under the
[05:25.480 --> 05:31.280]  military control of the US and NATO according to a report issued in 2013
[05:31.280 --> 05:36.280]  by the Afghanistan opium survey of the United Nations cultivation of poppy
[05:36.280 --> 05:43.000]  increased 36% in 2013 total opium production amounted to 5,500 tons of
[05:43.000 --> 05:49.280]  nearly half since 2012 and prior to the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan
[05:49.280 --> 05:53.920]  the Taliban had successfully blocked production of opium you can find more

[08:16.720 --> 08:22.040]  you live to the central Texas command center in the heart of the resistance
[08:22.040 --> 08:33.240]  it's Alex Jones well this morning when the news came out just a few hours ago
[08:33.240 --> 08:38.040]  that there'd been a tragic shooting on live television the first thing I
[08:38.040 --> 08:43.880]  thought was disgruntled employee on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor or similar
[08:43.880 --> 08:50.240]  drug only reason is is that most the time it's a disgruntled employee and
[08:50.240 --> 08:54.920]  almost all the time whether it's disgruntled or not they're on some
[08:54.920 --> 09:00.720]  type of psychotropic drug where the inserts say it can make you do this
[09:00.720 --> 09:04.200]  you'll have a thought when you're a normal person and think that's a crazy
[09:04.200 --> 09:06.920]  thought you'll have it when you're on these drugs and think that's an
[09:06.920 --> 09:13.120]  imperative to go out and do it but another wrinkle was added I knew that the
[09:13.120 --> 09:17.520]  system the controlled media would come out and apply guilt to all gun owners
[09:17.520 --> 09:23.560]  almost 200 million people now it's over 170 million more people are buying guns
[09:23.560 --> 09:28.080]  all the time it's causing crime rates to go down across the nation except for
[09:28.080 --> 09:32.160]  areas where guns have been restricted and the crime rates are exploding there
[09:32.160 --> 09:35.880]  we've got a report Rob do is putting together with all the official Justice
[09:35.880 --> 09:41.800]  Department graphs the latest numbers to show that and prove that as the economy
[09:41.800 --> 09:47.480]  degenerates though crime is going to naturally go up that's why having gun
[09:47.480 --> 09:53.240]  guns and security and lock in your doors and having neighborhood watch and basic
[09:53.240 --> 09:59.720]  things like that are going to be more important than ever in this climate and
[09:59.720 --> 10:05.440]  then he started tweeting live until he killed himself about 15 minutes ago as of
[10:05.440 --> 10:11.720]  airtime 1110 central he killed himself about five to 11 central time five to
[10:11.720 --> 10:19.200]  noon eastern time after the police had chased him and cornered him he went by
[10:19.200 --> 10:24.240]  Bryce Williams Paul Watson's done the research found that years ago more than
[10:24.240 --> 10:30.480]  a decade ago he sued a TV station he worked for in Florida and then now we're
[10:30.480 --> 10:35.000]  digging up more intel that this is just the same MO every TV station he went to
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.840]  EEOC filings everyone's racist everyone's optic getting I've been looking at
[10:40.840 --> 10:46.720]  photos and videos of him whacked out of his mind not hired to be a reporter not
[10:46.720 --> 10:54.360]  hard to be anchor but wanting to be an anchor wanting to be a reporter gets on
[10:54.360 --> 10:58.320]  psychotropic drugs you know that's coming out just you can guarantee it just
[10:58.320 --> 11:02.840]  like I said with the Charleston shooting that hasn't been established yet but I
[11:02.840 --> 11:07.120]  bet money within two days bet money and I've never seen it not be because that
[11:07.120 --> 11:11.080]  that's the added people don't do this normally white black or all the same as
[11:11.080 --> 11:15.040]  what you do when you're on these things and then you got MSNBC singing in and
[11:15.040 --> 11:19.480]  the thousands of tweets Paul's reported on per article where it's kill whites
[11:19.480 --> 11:22.360]  let's start killing let's beat them up let's shoot them let's go in their
[11:22.360 --> 11:26.240]  neighborhoods let's burn down their houses let's kill cops MSNBC having
[11:26.240 --> 11:31.480]  guests on that say deck the halls with dead cops follow a lot a lot a lot these
[11:31.480 --> 11:37.160]  are Soros funded groups led by Nancy Pelosi's top staffer Hillary Clinton's
[11:37.160 --> 11:42.040]  involved does that mean there aren't some out of control cops and some problems
[11:42.040 --> 11:46.920]  absolutely but the answer is don't go out just randomly shoot cops the answer
[11:46.920 --> 11:50.720]  isn't just go out and randomly some ladies at a Catholic church going to
[11:50.720 --> 11:55.160]  pray for mom you know who's dying and so hey a white lady went in that church
[11:55.160 --> 11:59.320]  nobody's in there it's open let's go beat her up and rob her because she's white
[11:59.320 --> 12:04.460]  because it's okay because she's white it's like the Klan let's go lynch this
[12:04.460 --> 12:07.960]  black person and rob them because they're black they deserve it it's the
[12:07.960 --> 12:13.960]  same gang mentality so you had Charleston which was fully blamed on the
[12:13.960 --> 12:18.520]  Second Amendment and then the guilt was applied to white people in general and
[12:18.520 --> 12:21.240]  you had all these black organizations and groups saying it's time to start
[12:21.240 --> 12:25.960]  killing whites and then I said if this starts getting triggered you're gonna
[12:25.960 --> 12:33.240]  have other unstable mentally ill black people go out and kill white people and
[12:33.240 --> 12:37.600]  then other mentally unstable white people are gonna go out and start killing
[12:37.600 --> 12:41.400]  black people and then if it really starts kicking off you're gonna get a
[12:41.400 --> 12:45.520]  full bore shooting war in this country and there's gonna be dead people all
[12:45.520 --> 12:49.320]  over the place chief amongst them the police and that will be the
[12:49.320 --> 12:53.600]  destabilization the feds use to come in and fully federalize which is what
[12:53.600 --> 12:59.720]  Obama told his cousin Odinga the Muslim leader when he lost the presidency of
[12:59.720 --> 13:04.720]  Kenya he said have people go out and riot and start burning stuff and Odinga
[13:04.720 --> 13:10.160]  did it for two months and they gave him the Prime Minister ship created a new
[13:10.160 --> 13:14.720]  level of government basically co-president and did the Muslims the
[13:14.720 --> 13:18.220]  radical Islamists have stopped then no they started attacking malls police
[13:18.220 --> 13:21.680]  stations all of it I mean these people know what they're doing and I'm not
[13:21.680 --> 13:25.760]  saying it's a Muslim takeover here I'm saying when George Soros spends over a
[13:25.760 --> 13:29.840]  hundred million dollars thirty three million in Ferguson alone to stir up and
[13:29.840 --> 13:36.200]  to try to get a race war going and MSNBC and CNN and others promote it like
[13:36.200 --> 13:43.720]  it's normal and good they plan on doing this they hope Charleston when Dylan
[13:43.720 --> 13:50.680]  roof the drug doubt of his mind on amnesics from his psychiatrist amnesics
[13:50.680 --> 13:54.880]  folks that's what sirhan sirhan was on I'm not saying this is stage but it
[13:54.880 --> 13:57.720]  staged in that you're just giving people if you like if you went and gave a
[13:57.720 --> 14:03.000]  bunch of high school kids in the prom punch PCP you you're not going to order
[14:03.000 --> 14:07.120]  some of them to drive off cliffs or cut their arms off or murder people but you
[14:07.120 --> 14:11.800]  basically get it knowing statistically you give 500 people at a prom PCP
[14:11.800 --> 14:17.280]  there's going to be probably 20 30 deaths that night it's the same thing you
[14:17.280 --> 14:23.400]  put 20% of the US public on psychotropics and other hardcore drugs you're
[14:23.400 --> 14:26.440]  going to have side effects in a percentage of them and it's not going to
[14:26.440 --> 14:33.640]  be pretty they're suicide mass murder pills that's what you blame as I told
[14:33.640 --> 14:37.680]  Piers Morgan two three years ago they were having three segments they came
[14:37.680 --> 14:43.320]  and said sponsors sponsors and I know that meant don't attack the fact that
[14:43.320 --> 14:48.800]  they've actually had prozac type drug ads on that very broadcast and I said
[14:48.800 --> 14:55.600]  Piers you got prozac type ads on here stop blaming the second amendment for
[14:55.600 --> 15:00.920]  what's going on here almost every mass shooter is on them and they're all
[15:00.920 --> 15:05.160]  whacked out of their brains you look at Adam Lanza any of these puppets the
[15:05.160 --> 15:09.280]  Batman shooter James Holmes you look at these people white black I don't care
[15:09.280 --> 15:16.480]  they're whacked out of their minds you look at the new shooter let's let's put
[15:16.480 --> 15:21.280]  this up on screen this article Virginia shooter who killed two journalists in
[15:21.280 --> 15:27.600]  live broadcast commit suicide report you look at the photos of him the same
[15:27.600 --> 15:35.000]  million-yard stare that stare I only see that in people who are whacked out of
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.240]  their brains on drugs I see methods that look like that too who haven't slept
[15:40.240 --> 15:49.040]  properly in six months and that's what is to blame here with a cocktail of
[15:49.040 --> 15:53.680]  media brainwashing and by the way I told the story hundreds of times I'll say
[15:53.680 --> 15:58.520]  it again you can look it up in criminology until they put fences up 20
[15:58.520 --> 16:04.240]  foot fences and walled in the Empire State's building the the World Trade
[16:04.240 --> 16:11.000]  Centers before they were destroyed in 91 2001 excuse me every time someone
[16:11.000 --> 16:15.400]  jumped off and committed suicide they'd have five six seven eight nine ten people
[16:15.400 --> 16:20.860]  show up in an hour of the news reporting it to jump off so they'd station
[16:20.860 --> 16:26.960]  police there to stop them the New York police are stationing police outside
[16:26.960 --> 16:33.160]  newsrooms across New York City right now because their criminology shows they'll
[16:33.160 --> 16:37.000]  probably have somebody try to go kill more reporters and that's the thing about
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.640]  giving so much attention to mass shootings is the media knows that
[16:40.640 --> 16:45.120]  mentally ill people who would just commit suicide or would do suicide by cop
[16:45.120 --> 16:50.800]  they'll think no I'll go kill somebody I don't like or I'll go shoot up a bunch
[16:50.800 --> 16:55.040]  of kids and then you don't even have to have somebody in a government MK ultra
[16:55.040 --> 17:00.240]  laboratory and have a mind control to go do it like sir hand sir hand you
[17:00.240 --> 17:05.120]  simply put it out there with enough of a drug doubt suggestible mesmerized
[17:05.120 --> 17:11.080]  hypnotized population and they're going to go out and they're going to commit
[17:11.080 --> 17:15.600]  these acts guaranteed they've got metrics they've got an analysis and as the
[17:15.600 --> 17:21.720]  economy implodes as society gets crazy as things degenerate you can bet all the
[17:21.720 --> 17:29.600]  tea in China that the world is going to get crazy and you know we've had the
[17:29.600 --> 17:36.560]  great statistics that since 92 because of gun ownership increasing and police
[17:36.560 --> 17:41.480]  forces expanding in size they basically tripled it's both those but the even the
[17:41.480 --> 17:46.680]  police groups have met it's the guns more than the police going out crime rates
[17:46.680 --> 17:55.480]  have dropped 52% some estimates are over 60% using guns now because of the
[17:55.480 --> 18:00.080]  economy imploding and the whole gang culture getting pushed across the board
[18:00.080 --> 18:04.000]  I think you're going to see crime massively increase I don't know if it'll
[18:04.000 --> 18:09.080]  be as bad as the 80s but this is the time to have guns to protect your family
[18:09.080 --> 18:12.600]  this is the time to start legally and lawfully check your local laws to carry
[18:12.600 --> 18:17.800]  guns this is the time not to go out and hate the police but to try to get
[18:17.800 --> 18:21.880]  control your local departments get good people elected good sheriff's in good
[18:21.880 --> 18:25.560]  police chiefs in for the community to work together try to stabilize this
[18:25.560 --> 18:29.960]  nation because the globalists want to destabilize it they want to get us at
[18:29.960 --> 18:33.440]  each other's throats that is not the answer the answer is to come together
[18:33.440 --> 18:38.840]  around the Bill of Rights Constitution due process private property and it's
[18:38.840 --> 18:42.480]  time for police who are getting evil orders I know in many departments to
[18:42.480 --> 18:47.040]  just quietly do the right thing and help this country and not get into the
[18:47.040 --> 18:51.400]  globalist culture of being thugs or being paramilitary and to be true peace
[18:51.400 --> 18:55.080]  officers and to be honorable honorable men and women and I know most of you want
[18:55.080 --> 18:58.440]  to do that so that's why I'm counting on you to do that because this is a
[18:58.440 --> 19:02.200]  premeditated takedown of America and the rest of the world we're about to go
[19:02.200 --> 19:07.400]  into and this guy shooting these white people because he was whacked out and
[19:07.400 --> 19:12.920]  racist doesn't need to cause any retaliation by white people just like
[19:12.920 --> 19:18.520]  when whacked out of his mind Dylan Roof went and shot these poor nine people who
[19:18.520 --> 19:24.840]  had done nothing to him cold-bloodedly the that community came together and the
[19:24.840 --> 19:28.480]  people that wanted to race war on both sides didn't get what they wanted so we
[19:28.480 --> 19:31.760]  should really say a prayer for these two dead people this reporter and this
[19:31.760 --> 19:37.520]  cameraman and just realize that you cannot blame the Second Amendment for
[19:37.520 --> 19:42.160]  this what psychos do is is their fault they're they're going to try to use this
[19:42.160 --> 19:46.000]  on the Second Amendment they're already doing it Obama's writing a bunch of
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.200]  executive action that's so dr. Coney and I am probably believing how bold it is so
[19:50.200 --> 19:55.560]  things are only intensifying and we can't let this distract us from all the

[24:40.080 --> 24:46.520]  Charleston church shooting motivated by racism media hype race warb or whether
[24:46.520 --> 24:56.760]  it's the Virginia TV shooting this is the mainstream media influencing big
[24:56.760 --> 25:04.720]  farmaheads then I said that days before it came out on the Virginia situation I
[25:04.720 --> 25:09.200]  said that days before it came out on the Charleston situation and I'm saying
[25:09.200 --> 25:16.320]  that that I believe it will come out with this Virginia situation but here's
[25:16.320 --> 25:21.720]  what we know if you just joined us this is now the number one big story in the
[25:21.720 --> 25:30.480]  world I've had BBC call me emails from Al Jazeera I mean my phone is ringing off
[25:30.480 --> 25:36.360]  the hook with mainstream media wanting to talk to me this morning I came out of
[25:36.360 --> 25:43.200]  the gym and the BBC was on the phone they're like well what do you say as a
[25:43.200 --> 25:47.640]  promoter of the Second Amendment now that this has happened and I said it's
[25:47.640 --> 25:50.320]  probably disgruntled mentally ill person that's why you need guns protect
[25:50.320 --> 25:53.480]  yourself but you can't ever protect yourself completely and bad things just
[25:53.480 --> 25:58.200]  happen but overall crime is down with guns because good people have guns but
[25:58.200 --> 26:02.440]  if the media hypes this up they'll be a bunch of copycats
[26:03.120 --> 26:08.000]  oh really that's really what you think yeah that's why as soon as I got in the
[26:08.000 --> 26:12.480]  car it was on the news the New York police station cops out front the TV
[26:12.480 --> 26:17.280]  news stations because other mentally ill people who are highly suggestible there's
[26:17.280 --> 26:22.920]  a good chance they're gonna go attack the TV stations don't you think I've
[26:22.920 --> 26:26.360]  thought about this somebody that does live broadcast that has reporters out
[26:26.360 --> 26:30.560]  in the field that goes out without bodyguards and give speeches like I did
[26:30.560 --> 26:35.760]  last weekend there's no security there you just got up you do it you make the
[26:35.760 --> 26:40.320]  decision just like I get my kids every morning when I take them to school or
[26:40.320 --> 26:45.240]  the nanny takes them to school and put them in the car that's the number one
[26:45.240 --> 26:49.920]  cause of death till they're about 60 years of age it's playing Frogger my
[26:49.920 --> 26:53.520]  kids are the frog and we're out there driving around with big 18 wheelers
[26:53.520 --> 26:58.040]  70 miles an hour right beside us there could be a blowout a jackknife we're
[26:58.040 --> 27:04.720]  all dead but I accept it I go past the fear I'm aware it's part of life I try
[27:04.720 --> 27:13.160]  to drive safe and it's much more dangerous to drive a car than it is to
[27:13.160 --> 27:16.840]  swim in a lake or anything and wait on the line one of the rarest ways to get
[27:16.840 --> 27:23.080]  killed if it's not by your own hand is somebody shooting you with a gun and you
[27:23.080 --> 27:26.840]  hear about the national numbers of 15,000 people got you know killed with
[27:26.840 --> 27:31.560]  guns last year in the United States yeah and 13 plus thousand of them were gang
[27:31.560 --> 27:35.000]  bangers and criminals and people breaking in houses and people shooting at the
[27:35.000 --> 27:41.120]  police only a couple thousand were innocent
[27:41.120 --> 27:48.760]  then you look at those numbers most of them committed suicide aren't you for
[27:48.760 --> 27:52.840]  right to die out there in the left no you're not so how are they gonna spin
[27:52.840 --> 27:56.240]  this they're gonna show the dramatic footage that we're about to roll right
[27:56.240 --> 28:02.960]  now of him in first person point of view with the gun this Vester Flanagan
[28:02.960 --> 28:11.880]  will start rolling that video with the gun out front as he goes and shoots the
[28:11.880 --> 28:18.560]  reporter and he's got the gun for like a minute or more walking around her
[28:18.560 --> 28:25.480]  menacing and she's so focused doing the interview about tourism that they have
[28:25.480 --> 28:30.640]  no idea then there's the cameraman no I guess he hadn't fallen EOC thing on him
[28:30.640 --> 28:37.440]  but I guess he deserves it all right guns her down she's dead and then turns
[28:37.440 --> 28:43.960]  the gun and shoots the cameraman and they are going to sit there and hammer
[28:43.960 --> 28:48.240]  that and push that and promote that and if you go to the front page of infowars
[28:48.240 --> 28:55.000]  calm guns don't kill people psychos kill people that's an Alex Jones quote that's
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.960]  a variant of the famous quote no one knows you first set it people don't kill
[28:59.960 --> 29:05.560]  people if you're the view of the Brady Center it's guns that come out of their
[29:05.560 --> 29:10.560]  cases at night and go out and kill people on their own no the truth is guns
[29:10.560 --> 29:14.840]  don't kill people people kill people well there's the Alex Jones version guns
[29:14.840 --> 29:19.960]  don't kill people psychos kill people and if you look at the image of his face
[29:19.960 --> 29:25.320]  from the TV cameraman's camera on the live feed as he drops the camera after
[29:25.320 --> 29:30.880]  being shot in the back there is the gunman who they said was dead now they're
[29:30.880 --> 29:35.880]  saying he's got a pulse and is in critical condition after trying to take
[29:35.880 --> 29:41.040]  his own life so the narrative is changing we're gonna go over all the news on
[29:41.040 --> 29:45.520]  this front open the phones up for you to respond straight ahead but what are the
[29:45.520 --> 29:50.520]  odds he was on mind-altering pharmacological drugs the empires on
[29:50.520 --> 29:56.680]  the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:58.000 --> 30:02.120]  we now know why stem express was so desperate to censor the undercover
[30:02.120 --> 30:06.520]  Planned Parenthood video featuring its CEO the law prohibits organ and tissue
[30:06.520 --> 30:09.960]  donors from selling for profit yet solicitation materials from stem
[30:09.960 --> 30:13.600]  express repeatedly tout how financially profitable and rewarding and
[30:13.600 --> 30:17.200]  beneficial it can be to the fiscal growth for abortion clinics and when asked
[30:17.200 --> 30:21.160]  what they can do to help clinics that aren't profiting the CEO is astonished
[30:21.160 --> 30:24.960]  and says she doesn't know any who aren't profiting you want to say this is about
[30:24.960 --> 30:28.520]  women's health she talks about the contamination of samples with staff due
[30:28.520 --> 30:33.000]  to unsanitary clinic conditions being a repeated problem and the stem express
[30:33.000 --> 30:37.720]  CEO talks about the stigma of delivering butchered baby parts to labs how they
[30:37.720 --> 30:40.760]  freak out how they have meltdowns when they get a whole head how they'll
[30:40.760 --> 30:44.560]  request hands and feet to be removed from limbs so they don't have to confront
[30:44.560 --> 30:49.040]  what it is but then she comments but we know what it is for that reason she says
[30:49.040 --> 30:55.960]  many are turning to adult stem cells or bone marrow and she concludes this is

[36:07.240 --> 36:12.560]  whole bunch of bodyguards and guns just like diane feinstein just like Michael
[36:12.560 --> 36:16.280]  Moore has got bodyguards and then she sits there and says heartbroken and
[36:16.280 --> 36:22.320]  angry oh you're so heartbroken I came to libya I saw Gaddafi died the country
[36:22.320 --> 36:29.920]  fell apart tens of thousands more died it's a failed country we use the IRS to
[36:29.920 --> 36:34.800]  persecute tens of thousands we ship guns into Mexico that killed thousands to
[36:34.800 --> 36:41.800]  blame the second amendment and here's the problem I've taken my filters off it's
[36:41.800 --> 36:45.480]  a family show I'm gonna stop talking like that on air I apologize it's just
[36:45.480 --> 36:49.680]  I've gotten so real that I can't look at her anymore without saying when I think
[36:49.680 --> 36:57.600]  of her she is a Joker faced arrogant lying criminal that wants it in our
[36:57.600 --> 37:02.880]  face and I'm sick of her and I'm sick of Barack Obama Barack Obama's got a new
[37:02.880 --> 37:07.640]  quote out in a speech on info wars.com I'll read the actual quote in a moment
[37:07.640 --> 37:11.200]  basically says it's time to just ignore people that don't agree with us we're
[37:11.200 --> 37:16.920]  gonna do what we want regardless yeah we know that you are destroying this
[37:16.920 --> 37:21.880]  country you're destroying America's name you're bankrupting us on purpose to be
[37:21.880 --> 37:27.040]  your slaves and then you're trying to start a race war there's the headline
[37:27.040 --> 37:34.680]  Obama we can't pay attention to folks whose ideologies run counter to where
[37:34.680 --> 37:44.200]  we need to go and that graphic is so powerful I was saying whoever in the
[37:44.200 --> 37:47.560]  office made that graphic it's a gold star I see it's not ours but I mean that
[37:47.560 --> 37:52.440]  really captures in that photo of him how evil just just how out of I mean we're
[37:52.440 --> 37:57.120]  going into real tyranny folks we're in the grasp of really bad people that want
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.280]  to dominate us they're the equivalent again of serial killers that want to
[38:01.280 --> 38:04.640]  grab a five-year-old out of a playground and torture them for a month in a
[38:04.640 --> 38:08.040]  subterranean dungeon because they love to terrorize them and have them beg for
[38:08.040 --> 38:12.360]  mommy you hear a child beg for mommy and sob and disdain for five seconds you
[38:12.360 --> 38:19.320]  want to tear your guts out to them it's like apple pie and mama's milk baby you
[38:19.320 --> 38:25.520]  understand oh these people are evil they're evil evil if you just got your
[38:25.520 --> 38:31.840]  mind around them they are the filth of the planet oh Hillary's broken hearted
[38:31.840 --> 38:38.640]  and angry we must act to stop gun violence and we cannot wait any longer
[38:38.640 --> 38:43.320]  praying for the victim's families in Virginia Paul Watson tweeted back at the
[38:43.320 --> 38:47.680]  witch and said absolutely shameful they used to wait at least a few hours before
[38:47.680 --> 38:53.160]  politicizing tragedy now it's instantaneous absolutely and now it comes
[38:53.160 --> 38:58.480]  out that he is basically a black lives matter obsessed all the white people are
[38:58.480 --> 39:03.960]  out to get me constantly filing EEOC complaints I mean he was tweeting he
[39:03.960 --> 39:08.720]  was yeah she was racist you she had made a racist comment I reported to the EEOC
[39:08.720 --> 39:13.640]  I bet the EEOC you'll try to do a hundred thousand dollar fine on the dead
[39:13.640 --> 39:18.520]  people I wonder if they'll find them and maybe maybe maybe maybe burn their
[39:18.520 --> 39:23.760]  dead bodies at the stake in front of the White House you know or I mean who
[39:23.760 --> 39:29.200]  knows because that's the whole religion that's pushed here and the chip on the
[39:29.200 --> 39:34.320]  shoulder attitude that is basically you know going around and then it's creates
[39:34.320 --> 39:39.400]  the ship on the shoulder by people like Dylan roof who also buys in from the
[39:39.400 --> 39:44.200]  other angle of the whole race war that's getting pushed let's go ahead and
[39:44.200 --> 39:48.760]  play one more time that first-person video from the start of your info wars
[39:48.760 --> 39:53.440]  visitor you got info wars.com forward slash show and find the free video and
[39:53.440 --> 39:57.880]  audio feeds radio listeners of course out there listening can go online info
[39:57.880 --> 40:01.920]  wars.com if they have time and see the free feed or we have the video posted
[40:01.920 --> 40:05.960]  they've been pulling it down though some of the media is showing it and we've
[40:05.960 --> 40:10.000]  got his tweets which they admit was his Twitter he reportedly shot himself live
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.800]  on air in his down critical condition may be dead they're going back and forth
[40:14.800 --> 40:21.000]  but certainly dramatic and Taylor made except for the fact in his tweets he
[40:21.000 --> 40:30.760]  says EEOC report filed oh my goodness Allison made racist comments oh well
[40:30.760 --> 40:36.680]  she's dead now you shot a woman in the back and of course in fairness to him
[40:36.680 --> 40:41.480]  he was trying to get the cameraman you can clearly look out on the video the
[40:41.480 --> 40:46.920]  camera person maybe politically correct excuse me boy and girls a bad term too
[40:46.920 --> 40:50.760]  long to use that purple penguins I went to a school today to drop my purple
[40:50.760 --> 40:55.360]  penguins off we're not the culture anything in this country excuse me the
[40:55.360 --> 41:03.120]  cameraman got shot in the back and he's trying to get her to turn around and
[41:03.120 --> 41:07.880]  look at him before he shoots her and he's right there about two feet away with
[41:07.880 --> 41:18.520]  the guy named right at her and of course you know the news business is
[41:18.520 --> 41:21.480]  competitive people are rude they're mean it's a long way to the top you want to
[41:21.480 --> 41:27.040]  rock and roll and a lot of folks just can't handle it so now the new modern
[41:27.040 --> 41:33.720]  age and then shoot the cameraman in the back because you follow the EEOC
[41:33.720 --> 41:39.640]  report you know I guess if Clarence Thomas talks about a pubic hair on his
[41:39.640 --> 41:43.960]  coke he deserves to not have his job either maybe Anita Hill was supposed to
[41:43.960 --> 41:48.120]  go shoot him I mean I don't know in this freaked out land you know hey there's a
[41:48.120 --> 41:52.280]  pubic hair on my coke oh my gosh let's have a national investigation he must
[41:52.280 --> 41:57.000]  be sexually harassing me that's what was so crazy about that was that was the
[41:57.000 --> 42:03.120]  extent of harassment was the pubic hair on the coke can you imagine this is our
[42:03.120 --> 42:07.280]  country where Hillary can ship guns into Mexico persecute people give guns to
[42:07.280 --> 42:12.680]  foreign dictators take money illegally order of Benghazi stand down be caught
[42:12.680 --> 42:21.800]  lying about it and we're busy indicting the Texas Attorney General because he
[42:21.800 --> 42:25.600]  was an investment advisor in a dinner party told two people about a good
[42:25.600 --> 42:31.080]  investment but didn't disclose that he was a member of the organization not
[42:31.080 --> 42:35.960]  ethical but my gosh they got so many laws now you can't even follow and I
[42:35.960 --> 42:40.120]  mean maybe he's bad maybe he's evil all I know is I have mountainous corruption
[42:40.120 --> 42:46.000]  hanging out in my face in your face in our collective face and nothing's being
[42:46.000 --> 42:52.600]  done about it so to recap there was a shooting at WDBJ television in
[42:52.600 --> 43:03.200]  Virginia Vester Flanagan was at the affiliate Twitter account suspended at
[43:03.200 --> 43:10.120]  her first-person video of shooting posted we have played that we have the graphic
[43:10.120 --> 43:16.400]  full video up on info wars calm the cops now say suspect in the murder shot
[43:16.400 --> 43:20.680]  himself is in critical condition first they thought he was dead but he does
[43:20.680 --> 43:26.840]  supposedly have a light pulse and he's a guy that worked his way into TV from the
[43:26.840 --> 43:31.600]  bottom ended up being able to be a reporter ended up being able to TV
[43:31.600 --> 43:35.680]  stations across the country but continually had to leave those stations
[43:35.680 --> 43:42.760]  after he filed EOC reports and lawsuits and you know you look at him ten years
[43:42.760 --> 43:46.520]  ago he looked like a pretty normal guy and look like reporter material you look
[43:46.520 --> 43:51.320]  at him now I mean he looked completely locked out of his mind and I am
[43:51.320 --> 43:58.560]  predicting that he was on drugs just like I took one look at Dylan Roof and I
[43:58.560 --> 44:05.000]  said I bet he's on amnesics there's probably 30 different classes of
[44:05.000 --> 44:09.280]  psychoactive psychotropic slash anti-psychotic drugs probably more than
[44:09.280 --> 44:13.880]  that how did I just magically say I bet he was on an amnesic because I saw how
[44:13.880 --> 44:18.200]  Sirhan Sirhan looked in photos and film I've seen how most these people look and
[44:18.200 --> 44:24.720]  when they're on an amnesic you really better look out and that always points
[44:24.720 --> 44:28.400]  towards it being staged as well because people won't remember and you can tell
[44:28.400 --> 44:35.000]  him oh you did the crime McVeigh was given amnesics in prison that's why he
[44:35.000 --> 44:38.680]  tell people next to his jail on medicine I'm former special forces secret
[44:38.680 --> 44:42.440]  operations which we got all the documents on we know he was set up I was
[44:42.440 --> 44:46.280]  infiltrating right wing groups I didn't want to be part of the bombing he told
[44:46.280 --> 44:49.520]  Larry Nichols that we've had Larry Nichols the guy from the cell next to
[44:49.520 --> 44:57.680]  him on from Death Row and it's the same story and then it came out that Roof
[44:57.680 --> 45:05.320]  was on a very strong amnesic so I don't know what the truth is in that case but
[45:05.320 --> 45:14.160]  regardless it's mind control because as a culture you put 20% of 330 million
[45:14.160 --> 45:18.080]  people on drugs that the drug insert says can make you go out and have
[45:18.080 --> 45:21.680]  psychotic breaks and then you're obsessed with video game shoot them ups
[45:21.680 --> 45:25.560]  which most the real shooters are not blaming video games I'm saying you put a
[45:25.560 --> 45:32.120]  mentally ill person on drugs on mind-control drugs with shoot them up
[45:32.120 --> 45:38.720]  games this is how you get a whack job par excellence they all have the same
[45:38.720 --> 45:46.040]  look in their eyes and the drugs flip a switch in the brain that does it very
[45:46.040 --> 45:49.680]  simple and they may take the drugs for five years and not have a problem they
[45:49.680 --> 45:53.640]  take too much take too little mix something with it and it's cuckoo land
[45:53.640 --> 46:01.960]  it's crazy town I've done methamphetamine twice in high school you're in a
[46:01.960 --> 46:05.200]  party good-looking girl says oh try it you'll love it we go drive to the beach
[46:05.200 --> 46:12.080]  you know you can stay up all night it's gonna be great and a day later I'm at
[46:12.080 --> 46:17.200]  the beach doing bad things nothing really horrible but you know not being a
[46:17.200 --> 46:20.280]  very nice person some of the few things I've done in my life that weren't very
[46:20.280 --> 46:25.920]  and I'll tell you I put cigarettes out on my hands it we're all sitting there on
[46:25.920 --> 46:30.000]  methamphetamine putting cigarettes out I have burns from those and now when I
[46:30.000 --> 46:35.000]  was like 15 years old I would never do that that's what hardcore drugs do
[46:35.000 --> 46:41.040]  ladies and gentlemen get it twice twice there's people that have done it
[46:41.040 --> 46:44.720]  thousands of times they look like space aliens I don't care if you're black or
[46:44.720 --> 46:48.160]  white or Hispanic walking on the street I go that's a meth head that's a meth
[46:48.160 --> 46:56.240]  that's a meth zombie and it is the pharmacological system that's causing
[46:56.240 --> 47:02.080]  this it's the main cause society generation family unraveling guns
[47:02.080 --> 47:07.040]  everywhere that obviously adds to it but you can't take my guns because it's a
[47:07.040 --> 47:16.800]  bunch of whacked out drugged out people running around it comes down to that
[47:16.800 --> 47:21.480]  that's what hardcore drugs do and I only share these stories to try to help
[47:21.480 --> 47:28.640]  people I want to open the phones up on the Charleston situation that ties in to
[47:28.640 --> 47:34.040]  the Virginia situation they're trying to push a race for this is clearly part of
[47:34.040 --> 47:39.640]  that with highly suggestible people Obama is coming in with massive executive
[47:39.640 --> 47:44.320]  pushes outside of law where they're just announcing for more than a hundred
[47:44.320 --> 47:50.360]  reasons they're gonna look at all the social security recipients and if you're
[47:50.360 --> 47:54.640]  paralyzed from the chest down or you do automatic money transfer you're gonna be
[47:54.640 --> 47:58.480]  declared incompetent outside of law used to have to have a big court hearing and
[47:58.480 --> 48:04.440]  a trial for that but they're just gonna declare you incompetent and there's no
[48:04.440 --> 48:08.240]  judge no jury they just come and take your guns or you can't buy guns and it's
[48:08.240 --> 48:11.720]  happening to veterans all over the country now what they've done to veterans
[48:11.720 --> 48:18.880]  is gonna be moved on to the older folks in America 65 and up and then it's
[48:18.880 --> 48:22.160]  gonna move on everybody else this is how turn he works it targets certain
[48:22.160 --> 48:25.640]  groups and slices and he's he's he's promising a whole bunch of other
[48:25.640 --> 48:31.160]  initiatives and you can believe it's coming you can believe it's here you
[48:31.160 --> 48:38.560]  can believe this is the big push and I predict there's gonna be white people go
[48:38.560 --> 48:42.800]  out and kill black folks is gonna be black folks killing white people there's
[48:42.800 --> 48:45.800]  gonna be more knockout games there's gonna be more cops getting shot I mean
[48:45.800 --> 48:49.040]  every couple days you hear about a cop getting shot sitting in their patrol
[48:49.040 --> 48:55.120]  car and in almost every case it's in a black inner city area and the person
[48:55.120 --> 48:58.880]  does it because of the black lives matter or two dumb white kids come into
[48:58.880 --> 49:02.440]  Detroit to buy a crack and the guy takes them to a field and tortures them to
[49:02.440 --> 49:06.840]  death after he ties them up and says in court because they're white and black
[49:06.840 --> 49:11.480]  lives matter as if it's gonna help black people to go out and kill two stupid
[49:11.480 --> 49:16.800]  crackhead white kids as if those stupid crack heads were doing anything to you
[49:16.800 --> 49:22.200]  but trying to put money in your stupid pocket but that's how whacked out this

[54:21.200 --> 54:33.840]  the video is getting pulled down but we'll have copies of it go up so they're
[54:33.840 --> 54:40.320]  not able to keep the public from seeing it where he in first person shoots a
[54:40.320 --> 54:44.840]  woman and you don't see any blood it's really not even that graphic but it
[54:44.840 --> 54:49.920]  shows how cold-blooded it is and I wonder if the media is gonna point out
[54:49.920 --> 54:53.880]  that he said he did it because they were racist and this is basically a black
[54:53.880 --> 54:58.680]  lives matter spillover I mean this is what the media is pushing this is what
[54:58.680 --> 55:03.680]  gets promoted on Twitter whites are being dehumanized as these monsters that
[55:03.680 --> 55:08.720]  deserve to die and then DrudgeReport.com links to Infowars.com where
[55:08.720 --> 55:15.080]  you can see the video for yourself and again we're showing this not to be
[55:15.080 --> 55:22.200]  macabre we're showing it because in the 60s we saw footage of kids being napalmed
[55:22.200 --> 55:32.680]  in Vietnam so we have a right to see this but yes warning it is graphic
[55:32.680 --> 55:39.360]  video and we should probably also point out and we do point out in the article
[55:39.360 --> 55:50.200]  that this is being pushed out of the news that he did this saying that she was
[55:50.200 --> 55:55.720]  racist and basically deserved it because they want to make it all about the
[55:55.720 --> 56:00.600]  Second Amendment and blame all gun owners black white Hispanic Asian old
[56:00.600 --> 56:06.000]  young Native American immigrant whatever they want to blame gun owners as if we
[56:06.000 --> 56:10.360]  collectively it'd be like if somebody ran over their neighbor's foot with a
[56:10.360 --> 56:14.800]  riding lawn mower and they went on TV and went you people that have riding
[56:14.800 --> 56:20.080]  lawn mowers you are all to blame how do you feel somebody killed somebody with
[56:20.080 --> 56:24.440]  a riding lawn mower hundreds of people a year get killed with psychos run over
[56:24.440 --> 56:33.400]  them with cars do we blame there was a Toyota truck a Toyota tundra and he
[56:33.400 --> 56:38.240]  ran over his wife with it how do you truck owners feel huh you want to
[56:38.240 --> 56:45.000]  apologize want to pay some reparations no I am individually responsible for what
[56:45.000 --> 56:51.240]  I do and the hallmark of a totalitarian society in every case is that you're
[56:51.240 --> 56:57.520]  collectively blamed for what individuals do in Russia in Nazi Germany you would
[56:57.520 --> 57:06.440]  be blamed in every case for what your neighbor did so that you could then be
[57:06.440 --> 57:10.840]  pressured to put cultural pressure on people to go along with the party oh if
[57:10.840 --> 57:14.880]  your neighbor got caught doing something anti-hitler and you didn't know
[57:14.880 --> 57:18.280]  about it you didn't report it you're now under suspicion you might get picked up
[57:18.280 --> 57:23.640]  you might get arrested we're gonna go to break and we're gonna come back and
[57:23.640 --> 57:31.920]  talk to Ben and Buckley and Cavick Robert Rob and many others that are

[57:46.320 --> 57:50.640]  I'm not sure what's gonna be happening with that we do have a guest popping in
[57:50.640 --> 57:54.920]  studio as well but regardless I'm going to be taking a lot of your phone call so

[57:59.720 --> 58:06.000]  busy focused in on this a lot of other things are happening as well and of course
[58:06.000 --> 58:11.640]  we also need to remember that the economy is in a designed contrived
[58:11.640 --> 58:18.640]  engineered meltdown and that pretty much everything else being promoted and push
[58:18.640 --> 58:22.960]  is a distraction from the fact that TPP and these other global government
[58:22.960 --> 58:29.280]  systems are being expanded right in front of us but there's no doubt the next big
[58:29.280 --> 58:35.360]  launch to come after our guns from executive action outside of law is now

[1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:19.160]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:19.160 --> 1:00:34.080]  Alex Jones how long until the news comes out that the Virginia shooter was on
[1:00:34.080 --> 1:00:40.680]  psychotropic type drugs I think it'll come out in the next two days or they
[1:00:40.680 --> 1:00:44.720]  might be successful in suppressant sometimes it comes out in the year he's
[1:00:44.720 --> 1:00:49.800]  in critical condition they said he was dead at about 1055 the police had him
[1:00:49.800 --> 1:00:54.360]  surrounded reportedly shot himself in the head Bryce Williams was the name of
[1:00:54.360 --> 1:00:59.960]  the reporters who reportedly did this after losing his job
[1:00:59.960 --> 1:01:07.800]  Vester Flanagan was his real name worked at WDB J and I've already shown the
[1:01:07.800 --> 1:01:13.000]  footage I'm not gonna show it again of him in first person like a video game
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:18.680]  going around shooting people shooting the cameraman shooting the woman waiting
[1:01:18.680 --> 1:01:22.920]  till the camera pans back to the reporter so it be on tape trying to get
[1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:26.840]  her to turn around so she would see him and he just has that typical whacked out
[1:01:26.840 --> 1:01:33.080]  look in his eye of these type of shooters and the truth is you can't stop
[1:01:33.080 --> 1:01:39.720]  people like this you will have a small percentage of people that go out and kill
[1:01:39.720 --> 1:01:44.220]  people every week or so in Japan and China we hear about you know 15 killed
[1:01:44.220 --> 1:01:49.400]  five killed seven killed by man with with a homemade knife or man with machete
[1:01:49.400 --> 1:01:56.040]  or man with sword I mean that's what happens a whacked out person has got
[1:01:56.040 --> 1:02:00.400]  the will to kill people with a samurai sword you can go into a room of 1520
[1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:08.320]  people and kill them in fact a lot of cases swords per whack can be more deadly
[1:02:08.320 --> 1:02:12.240]  than a gun because a gun sometimes the bullet goes in a weird direction that
[1:02:12.240 --> 1:02:16.040]  with a sword chop an arm right off a lot of folks will die from that it's a
[1:02:16.040 --> 1:02:19.680]  clean cut it's one thing if your car gets you know your arm gets mangled in a
[1:02:19.680 --> 1:02:24.120]  car or something and then you're bleeding but it's able to clot up but a
[1:02:24.120 --> 1:02:29.400]  clean cut or get stabbed the stomach by a big old sword or a big old butcher
[1:02:29.400 --> 1:02:36.160]  knife you're dead just as often or more so from the numbers I've seen them with
[1:02:36.160 --> 1:02:42.440]  a firearm now if I shoot you with my 500 Smith and Wesson it might be a little
[1:02:42.440 --> 1:02:47.760]  bit different okay this is a short little no man's land segment I'm gonna
[1:02:47.760 --> 1:02:51.600]  come back at the beginning of the next segment and go right to you pronounce
[1:02:51.600 --> 1:02:59.400]  that Kavik in Canada Buckley Robert Kyvick Kyvick Buckley Robert Rob bin
[1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:04.720]  and others that are patiently holding and I want to ask the listeners am I
[1:03:04.720 --> 1:03:09.120]  wrong saying that we shouldn't land the Second Amendment I mean obviously we
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:15.600]  shouldn't crime with guns is way down but the mainstream media is
[1:03:15.600 --> 1:03:20.560]  predictably doing that well then how do we force the discussion of the fact that
[1:03:20.560 --> 1:03:29.800]  White House controlled media from media matters to CNBC to MSNBC to CNN not so
[1:03:29.800 --> 1:03:34.960]  much CNBC but they do some of it are pushing racial division narratives
[1:03:34.960 --> 1:03:39.280]  and acting like all the stress and all the problems in America isn't the
[1:03:39.280 --> 1:03:44.120]  economy isn't the GMO isn't all the screen time isn't 20% of the public on
[1:03:44.120 --> 1:03:51.080]  hardcore big pharma drugs mass murder suicide pills no you're not getting
[1:03:51.080 --> 1:03:55.200]  ahead because racist white people are conspiring against you because you're
[1:03:55.200 --> 1:04:02.160]  black and then white people that aren't doing too good generally they hear
[1:04:02.160 --> 1:04:06.000]  this and think it's ridiculous they've been treated racially bad they've been
[1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:10.360]  beaten up in high school that's the classic MO they decide to get a gun and
[1:04:10.360 --> 1:04:15.120]  go shoot a bunch of black people and it's just so stupid it's like we're two
[1:04:15.120 --> 1:04:21.600]  bulls in the arena and you've got the matador with a red cape or two red
[1:04:21.600 --> 1:04:26.440]  capes manipulating us both to run into each other but instead of being one
[1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:30.960]  bull the matador has got a sword behind it that he pulls the cape out of the way
[1:04:30.960 --> 1:04:39.000]  and the bull goes on to the sword instead he's got two capes like this when
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:44.280]  he pulls them back the bulls ram straight into each other head on killing
[1:04:44.280 --> 1:04:49.320]  themselves because make no mistake this whole black lives matter race war
[1:04:49.320 --> 1:04:58.040]  George Searle situation is a matador with a cape driving us on to the sword
[1:04:58.040 --> 1:05:01.880]  we now know why stem express was so desperate to censor the undercover
[1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:06.280]  Planned Parenthood video featuring its CEO the law prohibits organ and tissue
[1:05:06.280 --> 1:05:09.720]  donors from selling for profit yet solicitation materials from stem
[1:05:09.720 --> 1:05:13.360]  express repeatedly tout how financially profitable and rewarding and
[1:05:13.360 --> 1:05:17.000]  beneficially can be to the fiscal growth for abortion clinics and when asked
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:20.920]  what they can do to help clinics that aren't profiting the CEO is astonished
[1:05:20.920 --> 1:05:24.720]  and says she doesn't know any who aren't profiting you want to say this is about
[1:05:24.720 --> 1:05:28.280]  women's health she talks about the contamination of samples with staff due
[1:05:28.280 --> 1:05:32.760]  to unsanitary clinic conditions being a repeated problem and the stem express
[1:05:32.760 --> 1:05:37.520]  CEO talks about the stigma of delivering butchered baby parts to labs how they
[1:05:37.520 --> 1:05:40.520]  freak out how they have meltdowns when they get a whole head how they'll
[1:05:40.520 --> 1:05:44.320]  request hands and feet to be removed from limbs so they don't have to confront
[1:05:44.320 --> 1:05:48.800]  what it is but then she comments but we know what it is for that reason she says
[1:05:48.800 --> 1:05:55.720]  many are turning to adult stem cells or bone marrow and she concludes this is

[1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:17.800]  people saying well if she was racist you know she deserved to die that type of
[1:09:17.800 --> 1:09:23.080]  stuff's on Twitter you can see the graphic video at info wars.com the
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:28.480]  easiest place to find it is drudge report.com the shooter himself shot
[1:09:28.480 --> 1:09:33.840]  video pretty good camera guy he'd done that first in media as he holds the gun
[1:09:33.840 --> 1:09:38.080]  out in front of him and video tapes and then he shoots her and then shoots the
[1:09:38.080 --> 1:09:45.280]  cameraman identified Vester L Flanagan post video of shooting warning very
[1:09:45.280 --> 1:09:51.200]  graphic Allison made racist comments he went on to say update shooter himself
[1:09:51.200 --> 1:09:55.960]  in critical condition NYPD beefing up security at all media outlets after
[1:09:55.960 --> 1:10:05.360]  news shootings. Meanwhile San Francisco has the same problem that government
[1:10:05.360 --> 1:10:12.160]  buildings have how to solve the city's public pooping problem they're not sure
[1:10:12.160 --> 1:10:17.040]  why the more liberal a city it is the more public pooping there is and I'm
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:21.200]  not trying to be funny here this is part of the mass mental illness of why is
[1:10:21.200 --> 1:10:25.400]  there more homeless people more degradation more ugliness more
[1:10:25.400 --> 1:10:30.560]  sickening this and it's just all part of people that are spoiled brats want to
[1:10:30.560 --> 1:10:35.000]  get weirder and weirder and just society starts to collapse and I'm telling you
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:39.040]  San Francisco is a beautiful city but since I was there as a young child and
[1:10:39.040 --> 1:10:44.080]  as a young man it is a pit compared to what it used to be like it is really
[1:10:44.080 --> 1:10:49.360]  gross and it is really going downhill in California is really rotting and then
[1:10:49.360 --> 1:10:54.600]  you got a nice areas like Santa Cruz or places like Newport Beach down on the
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:59.360]  south beautiful beautiful nice people but then you get around the liberal
[1:10:59.360 --> 1:11:05.240]  degradation and it's like an open sore on a dog with maggots dripping out and
[1:11:05.240 --> 1:11:10.120]  I'm not trying to be gross here but I mean these people are a curse and we
[1:11:10.120 --> 1:11:15.720]  just start realizing it they jack up taxes they fund the most degenerate
[1:11:15.720 --> 1:11:21.120]  people they fund degradation because they love it they are aberrant they are a
[1:11:21.120 --> 1:11:25.040]  problem they are hypocrites Hillary Clinton has all these guns all these
[1:11:25.040 --> 1:11:29.080]  bodyguards she's out in the news saying restrict the Second Amendment all this
[1:11:29.080 --> 1:11:35.760]  other garbage it makes my blood boil we told you this was common six seven
[1:11:35.760 --> 1:11:39.720]  years ago they said we were conspiracy theorist North Dakota first state to
[1:11:39.720 --> 1:11:43.760]  legalize armed drones for the police
[1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:52.080]  man indicted for firing a shotgun and a drone hovering near his home
[1:11:52.080 --> 1:11:59.760]  that's some of the news you go to info wars.com Clinton exploits Virginia
[1:11:59.760 --> 1:12:04.480]  shooting to call for gun legislation Kurt Nemo graphic shocking complete
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:09.440]  video shot from Virginia gunman's point of view hey guys do has the graphics
[1:12:09.440 --> 1:12:13.560]  from the Justice Department I know you have them as a package as well can we
[1:12:13.560 --> 1:12:19.000]  find and play the numbers from 92 to 2012 they haven't done new numbers since
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:26.280]  with the 51% drop that's what Fox says it's a 51% drop professor lot on the top
[1:12:26.280 --> 1:12:32.320]  statisticians in the world says it's 61 whatever I'll take 51 and not argue 51
[1:12:32.320 --> 1:12:35.640]  percent drop in crime we need to just keep hammering that and show how they're
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:41.120]  creating the perception that there's all this increased crime with guns the truth
[1:12:41.120 --> 1:12:45.400]  is good people are stopping the bad people we're scaring them after you pass
[1:12:45.400 --> 1:12:50.280]  concealed carry in a state look at the numbers massive drop between 25 and 50
[1:12:50.280 --> 1:12:55.760]  plus percent within a couple years in Texas in Florida other states after
[1:12:55.760 --> 1:13:00.280]  concealed carry went in it works like a charm because a criminal is gonna car
[1:13:00.280 --> 1:13:04.480]  jack in doesn't care if there's laws against guns law-abiding citizens won't
[1:13:04.480 --> 1:13:07.720]  carry a gun most the time unless they've already been mugged or attacked then
[1:13:07.720 --> 1:13:12.720]  they'll break the law statistics show to protect themselves so after you legalize
[1:13:12.720 --> 1:13:17.940]  it the car jacking stop very quick because people get blown away I love the
[1:13:17.940 --> 1:13:21.960]  fact that women jog with fanny packs in parks where they get robbed and then
[1:13:21.960 --> 1:13:27.920]  after a few women shoot a few thugs it stops and my daughters are getting good
[1:13:27.920 --> 1:13:34.680]  with guns that's what it's all about your wife that's true feminism but they
[1:13:34.680 --> 1:13:37.440]  don't want that now I mentioned this before the break that I'm gonna go to
[1:13:37.440 --> 1:13:41.800]  your phone calls and that's it if you see George Soros in the White House
[1:13:41.800 --> 1:13:46.200]  funding black lives matter trying to act like black people are being targeted
[1:13:46.200 --> 1:13:49.720]  and that's the number one issue in the country don't get mad at the corrupt
[1:13:49.720 --> 1:13:52.520]  central government don't get mad at the Federal Reserve don't get mad at Obama
[1:13:52.520 --> 1:13:57.040]  and the doubling of black unemployment the problem is police and there are some
[1:13:57.040 --> 1:14:00.240]  problems that's part of the government but they focus only on the bottom and
[1:14:00.240 --> 1:14:04.760]  then act like rioting and shooting and attacking and burning is going to fix
[1:14:04.760 --> 1:14:10.040]  something and then imply whites are inherently racist whites are inherently
[1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:16.840]  bad they're a problem so knockout games shootings all of this intensifies then a
[1:14:16.840 --> 1:14:21.840]  crazy white person feels like he's under attack he buys into it the Dylan rough
[1:14:21.840 --> 1:14:27.240]  character at the Charleston shooting goes in and shoots people now you've got
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:31.600]  this guy who's filing EEOC things left and right and leaving TV stations in
[1:14:31.600 --> 1:14:37.080]  Florida and other parts of the country he lands in Virginia become successful
[1:14:37.080 --> 1:14:43.840]  has some type of problems leaves the TV station now there are the statistics
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:49.320]  massive drop as guns increase crime drops and then suddenly whether she said
[1:14:49.320 --> 1:14:55.000]  something racist or not did she deserve to get shot in the back if I claim a
[1:14:55.000 --> 1:15:00.120]  black person said something racist to me do I get to shoot him in the back no
[1:15:00.120 --> 1:15:08.040]  it's inherently very similar to what roof did and will they be able to hype
[1:15:08.040 --> 1:15:16.080]  further escalations out of this and I use the analogy earlier the globalist will
[1:15:16.080 --> 1:15:23.200]  put a political football issue out there that's the red cape the bull sees it
[1:15:23.200 --> 1:15:28.320]  tries to attack it and the matador might spend 20 30 minutes depending on how
[1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:32.920]  good he is risking his life to barely turn out of the way as the sharpened
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:40.960]  horns with the multi-thousand pound creature runs right by many matadors
[1:15:40.960 --> 1:15:44.680]  have been killed obviously every year 11 people died in the running of the
[1:15:44.680 --> 1:15:49.520]  bulls this year in Spain alone and I like the fact they can't ban it because
[1:15:49.520 --> 1:15:52.760]  it's pure political correctness it's an ancient cultural sport thousands of
[1:15:52.760 --> 1:15:55.760]  years old really going back to the Coliseum in Rome and I'm not endorsing
[1:15:55.760 --> 1:15:58.800]  all things that happen in Rome but you know this is somebody put in their life
[1:15:58.800 --> 1:16:02.560]  on the line we're showing some footage one of Spain's most famous matadors
[1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:06.680]  right now and then they start throwing little barbed hooks into the bull's back
[1:16:06.680 --> 1:16:11.760]  to infuriate them even more and then finally they put a sword behind the red
[1:16:11.760 --> 1:16:16.520]  cape and when the bull charges in the matador drives the sword all the way
[1:16:16.520 --> 1:16:21.400]  into the bull's heart which is incredibly skillful incredibly hard to stab
[1:16:21.400 --> 1:16:27.480]  through a foot of meat and bone and ribs with perfect targeting a true work of
[1:16:27.480 --> 1:16:33.360]  art to get it into the heart then it's the meats given to poor people this is
[1:16:33.360 --> 1:16:38.240]  just ancient human hunting this ancients would would would drive spears into the
[1:16:38.240 --> 1:16:43.520]  chest of bulls that's how far back this goes tens of thousands of years into
[1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:47.560]  human history and the matador turns his back on the bull enticing him to come
[1:16:47.560 --> 1:16:52.560]  in now the globalists do this all the time try to bait people into things and
[1:16:52.560 --> 1:16:56.080]  that's what black lives matter is but it's more than that it's like a matador
[1:16:56.080 --> 1:17:01.120]  with two red capes getting two bulls to run into each other killing themselves
[1:17:01.120 --> 1:17:08.360]  this is all this is is divide and conquer manipulation and the black races the
[1:17:08.360 --> 1:17:12.160]  white races from their perspectives they see real stuff that's going on real
[1:17:12.160 --> 1:17:17.840]  problems but it's a false paradigm in that it's been manipulated and
[1:17:17.840 --> 1:17:22.480]  statistically even if you got real beefs with white people or real beefs with
[1:17:22.480 --> 1:17:27.080]  black people or real beefs with hispanics or vice versa overall the
[1:17:27.080 --> 1:17:30.560]  globalist or geoengineering they're putting poison in the water they're
[1:17:30.560 --> 1:17:34.760]  force-feeding as GMO they won't let us label stuff they're opening up the
[1:17:34.760 --> 1:17:38.720]  borders they're launching all these wars they're funding al-qaeda they're
[1:17:38.720 --> 1:17:42.760]  funding fast and furious they're cold-blooded they're evil and they're
[1:17:42.760 --> 1:17:47.440]  pushing all this because it helps them have us at each other's throats and I
[1:17:47.440 --> 1:17:52.960]  know that's elementary but that's why I've reached out to the races black groups
[1:17:52.960 --> 1:17:57.080]  that have been told to go to Hades it's why I've reached out people like David
[1:17:57.080 --> 1:18:00.320]  Duke and tried to actually have a real discussion with him and not just getting
[1:18:00.320 --> 1:18:04.160]  to fight with him but try to explain to him the larger paradigm and because I
[1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:07.760]  didn't agree with him his acolytes now hate my guts well don't worry I won't
[1:18:07.760 --> 1:18:12.640]  talk to him again I won't reach out to try to you know just do the right thing
[1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:16.880]  and be shoveled us here okay fine the point is if people want their ignorance
[1:18:16.880 --> 1:18:20.800]  they're going to have it but if you want to stop most of mass shootings get

[1:23:59.560 --> 1:24:03.240]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents
[1:24:03.240 --> 1:24:14.520]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[1:24:14.520 --> 1:24:21.320]  obviously i'm wound up this season of craziness has really got me on edge
[1:24:21.320 --> 1:24:24.680]  there's a battle going on in the control media right now to blame the second
[1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:27.400]  amendment and collectively blame all of us
[1:24:27.400 --> 1:24:31.320]  i've had a whole bunch of different tv networks newspapers you name it or
[1:24:31.320 --> 1:24:34.760]  calling emailing saying we want comment from alex jones what
[1:24:34.760 --> 1:24:40.200]  does he say now it'd be like if i raised cattle
[1:24:40.200 --> 1:24:44.360]  cattle kill hundreds of people a year speaking of bulls in the u.s alone
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:49.000]  and somebody had a bull get out of their pin and kill a five-year-old kid
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:53.800]  that happened in texas just last year you got cows too
[1:24:53.800 --> 1:24:57.640]  how you feeling after that cow did that it's like well that happens that's
[1:24:57.640 --> 1:25:01.080]  part of life i'm sad but it's not my fault
[1:25:01.080 --> 1:25:04.120]  it's not my bull
[1:25:04.520 --> 1:25:07.080]  i mean it's the same thing that they sit there with a straight face and
[1:25:07.080 --> 1:25:11.880]  collectively blame gun owners it's just crazy it's time to get back in
[1:25:11.880 --> 1:25:15.800]  their faces then meanwhile this is obviously some mentally
[1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:21.640]  unstable black job who said that she was racist so she deserved it
[1:25:21.640 --> 1:25:25.640]  so clearly you got a lot stronger link there than blaming gun owners
[1:25:25.640 --> 1:25:29.640]  to say the media pushing racial division as a distraction
[1:25:29.640 --> 1:25:36.360]  there to blame so i'm going to say msnbc cn and others pushing race war
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:42.040]  are to blame for the virginia tv shooting i want to tweak that out right
[1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:46.440]  now msnbc
[1:25:46.440 --> 1:25:49.320]  and cnn
[1:25:50.040 --> 1:25:54.520]  contributed to this shooting by pushing race war
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:58.760]  not the second amendment i don't know how you put that all into a tweet the
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:04.120]  problem is condensing it cna msnbc
[1:26:04.920 --> 1:26:07.960]  and dinosaur media
[1:26:07.960 --> 1:26:13.000]  are responsible for pushing race war
[1:26:13.160 --> 1:26:17.240]  and causing this latest shooting not the second amendment
[1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:21.160]  i want to tweet that at real alex jones because that's what this comes down to
[1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:24.680]  okay i'm ranting uh who's up first here john who's been
[1:26:24.680 --> 1:26:27.320]  holding the longest
[1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:32.520]  kivick in canada you're up first thank you for calling in today
[1:26:32.840 --> 1:26:36.440]  hi alex can you hear me sure can go ahead
[1:26:36.440 --> 1:26:39.880]  well greetings once again from canada alex thanks for taking my call again
[1:26:39.880 --> 1:26:43.720]  and thanks to you and your whole crew for all your good works thank you uh
[1:26:43.720 --> 1:26:47.080]  and and i i'm glad you enjoyed toronto island
[1:26:47.080 --> 1:26:50.040]  it is a beautiful place isn't it i'm going to bring my kids back up they're
[1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:55.160]  very beautiful i really like toronto yeah it's a great town it really is
[1:26:55.160 --> 1:26:59.320]  uh now talking about this shooting as a canadian i can assure you that handgun
[1:26:59.320 --> 1:27:03.160]  restrictions will not stop crazy or stupid people from shooting other
[1:27:03.160 --> 1:27:07.480]  people it's almost impossible in canada to get a ccw
[1:27:07.480 --> 1:27:10.920]  and yet there's still handgun shootings every single week up here
[1:27:10.920 --> 1:27:16.200]  wait a minute are you saying that spoons don't make people fat
[1:27:16.200 --> 1:27:22.040]  uh you know and alcohol doesn't make people crash into trees
[1:27:22.040 --> 1:27:27.880]  apparently i mean it's so obvious that roseo donnell's not to blame for being
[1:27:27.880 --> 1:27:31.720]  fat it is the fact that spoons in her cupboard
[1:27:31.720 --> 1:27:35.400]  made her eat all that food same thing with michael more
[1:27:35.400 --> 1:27:39.160]  absolutely and you know i think this became such a big story
[1:27:39.160 --> 1:27:43.080]  so quickly because it's the first time since bud Dwyer and christine chubbitt
[1:27:43.080 --> 1:27:48.360]  killed themselves on live tv and we now have the internet to stoke the flames
[1:27:48.360 --> 1:27:51.000]  oh yeah this is going to be the biggest news story for a few weeks and it's
[1:27:51.000 --> 1:27:55.720]  going to distract that's why i'm sending joe biggs and david night
[1:27:55.720 --> 1:27:59.960]  right now on an airplane the problem is it takes two hours once they get to an
[1:27:59.960 --> 1:28:03.720]  airport to get out there so they won't be out there till like 10 o'clock tonight
[1:28:03.720 --> 1:28:06.840]  but the rest of mainstream media won't get there until this afternoon
[1:28:06.840 --> 1:28:10.200]  so we're going to be there covering the media spectacle
[1:28:10.200 --> 1:28:17.240]  and their propaganda and also getting questions in on real issues like was he
[1:28:17.240 --> 1:28:21.640]  on psychotropic drugs i mean because the cops will want to tell us
[1:28:21.640 --> 1:28:24.360]  we're going to be there talking to the police that's what joe biggs is being
[1:28:24.360 --> 1:28:28.120]  sent to do along with david night and and to really do real journalism
[1:28:28.120 --> 1:28:31.800]  cover what the media is doing cover what the democratic operatives are doing
[1:28:31.800 --> 1:28:35.160]  and then talk to the police and others and get the scoop
[1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:39.080]  was this guy on psychotropic drugs you know do bears go to the bathroom in the
[1:28:39.080 --> 1:28:42.840]  woods uh do tweety birds sing i mean every
[1:28:42.840 --> 1:28:46.120]  time i i predict they're on it they always are
[1:28:46.120 --> 1:28:50.920]  what do you think the chances are this guy wasn't on some drugs
[1:28:50.920 --> 1:28:54.440]  oh no all you got to do is look at his pictures and read his tweets and whatnot
[1:28:54.440 --> 1:28:57.000]  this guy was unhinged he was completely unhinged
[1:28:57.000 --> 1:29:00.120]  you know as this was going on there was a bunch of me and another a whole bunch
[1:29:00.120 --> 1:29:04.200]  of info warriors in an info wars irc chat room
[1:29:04.200 --> 1:29:07.160]  which by the way i think you should get rid of the comment sections on the
[1:29:07.160 --> 1:29:11.960]  articles and put a live chat or link or a login to planted info wars so we can
[1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:15.960]  have real-time conversations because the the comments sections have just
[1:29:15.960 --> 1:29:18.760]  become chaos since the david duke interview it's just
[1:29:18.760 --> 1:29:22.680]  complete nonsense well that's actually good though that just brings us more
[1:29:22.680 --> 1:29:27.320]  traffic and and i like that controversy um
[1:29:27.320 --> 1:29:30.200]  i mean if people think me giving somebody two hours on air to put out their
[1:29:30.200 --> 1:29:34.040]  ideas of censorship good i mean i want to have that type of mental
[1:29:34.040 --> 1:29:36.280]  illness attack me they don't understand how the internet
[1:29:36.280 --> 1:29:40.840]  works or how metrics work uh it's really helping the site so i'm
[1:29:40.840 --> 1:29:43.880]  actually quite thankful for it i hope it intensifies actually the
[1:29:43.880 --> 1:29:47.880]  traffic's really helping us with our click rates with our sponsors
[1:29:47.880 --> 1:29:58.680]  we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:29:58.680 --> 1:30:02.040]  we now know why stem express was so desperate to censor the undercover
[1:30:02.040 --> 1:30:06.360]  planned parenthood video featuring its ceo the law prohibits organ and tissue
[1:30:06.360 --> 1:30:09.800]  donors from selling for profit yet solicitation materials from stem
[1:30:09.800 --> 1:30:13.400]  express repeatedly tout how financially profitable and rewarding and
[1:30:13.400 --> 1:30:16.840]  beneficial it can be to the fiscal growth for abortion clinics and when
[1:30:16.840 --> 1:30:19.560]  asked what they can do to help clinics that aren't profiting
[1:30:19.560 --> 1:30:23.880]  the ceo is astonished and says she doesn't know any who aren't profiting
[1:30:23.880 --> 1:30:26.920]  you want to say this is about women's health she talks about the contamination
[1:30:26.920 --> 1:30:30.520]  of samples with staff due to unsanitary clinic conditions
[1:30:30.520 --> 1:30:35.000]  being a repeated problem and the stem express ceo talks about the stigma of
[1:30:35.000 --> 1:30:38.920]  delivering butchered baby parts to labs how they freak out how they have melt
[1:30:38.920 --> 1:30:41.240]  downs when they get a whole head how they'll request
[1:30:41.240 --> 1:30:44.760]  hands and feet to be removed from limbs so they don't have to confront what it
[1:30:44.760 --> 1:30:47.720]  is but then she comments but we know what it is
[1:30:47.720 --> 1:30:52.200]  for that reason she says many are turning to adult stem cells or bone marrow
[1:30:52.200 --> 1:30:56.680]  and she concludes either in the cause or not yeah this is david night reporting

[1:33:02.520 --> 1:33:06.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[1:33:06.520 --> 1:33:13.400]  you want answers well so does he it's alex jones on the juicy and radio
[1:33:13.400 --> 1:33:15.960]  network
[1:33:25.240 --> 1:33:32.120]  rob in main ben in missouri robert missouri buckley in
[1:33:32.120 --> 1:33:34.920]  missouri missouri missouri missouri we're gonna be going to all of you
[1:33:34.920 --> 1:33:41.000]  800-259-9231 here in just a moment but i gotta mention this news
[1:33:41.000 --> 1:33:45.320]  you can probably find i don't want to exaggerate
[1:33:45.320 --> 1:33:50.360]  5000 news articles sort like 3000 in one week one time
[1:33:50.360 --> 1:33:54.920]  because ap got republished everywhere saying that there was no plan to use
[1:33:54.920 --> 1:33:58.760]  drones to surveil you no plan to weaponize drones
[1:33:58.760 --> 1:34:01.720]  even as it was being announced by law enforcement federally
[1:34:01.720 --> 1:34:05.880]  state and local in the last five six years
[1:34:05.880 --> 1:34:09.640]  they would have articles going alex jones at info wars dot com are liars
[1:34:09.640 --> 1:34:12.920]  there is no plan to surveil you no plan to surveil farmers
[1:34:12.920 --> 1:34:16.840]  and what they're planting or what they do with drones no plan to weaponize them
[1:34:16.840 --> 1:34:19.960]  matt drudge then ran the lying article of info wars
[1:34:19.960 --> 1:34:24.120]  and put out the horrible disinformation and that's because they didn't want to
[1:34:24.120 --> 1:34:27.480]  debate about it before they rolled it out
[1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:32.440]  they've since had houston crash drones they've tested arm drones
[1:34:32.440 --> 1:34:37.160]  and then look it makes perfect sense if you got some suspect held up or whatever
[1:34:37.160 --> 1:34:41.080]  and not send cops in to get killed to send in a drone
[1:34:41.080 --> 1:34:44.840]  the problem is then they'll get rid of humans all together have nothing but
[1:34:44.840 --> 1:34:48.360]  drones and then that doesn't have human decision making
[1:34:48.360 --> 1:34:53.000]  in it and the globalists that have a technocracy they can program and control
[1:34:53.000 --> 1:34:56.520]  and that's why they're going there when i flew to canada they gave us on the
[1:34:56.520 --> 1:35:01.240]  airplane uh the national post on on canada air
[1:35:01.240 --> 1:35:04.520]  and that's the big national paper of canada obviously and in the cover story
[1:35:04.520 --> 1:35:07.640]  was i meant to bring it back but i left it on the plane
[1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:10.680]  maybe you guys can pull it up that the headline was
[1:35:10.680 --> 1:35:16.920]  as roads go driverless insurance companies may be thing of the past
[1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:19.560]  and the article is like yeah it's going to save you money and there's going to
[1:35:19.560 --> 1:35:23.400]  be because of the insurance they're still going to be insurance
[1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:26.840]  they're just going to phase you out of your car having it be
[1:35:26.840 --> 1:35:30.200]  higher because you're quote not as good a driver as the driverless car
[1:35:30.200 --> 1:35:34.360]  they've said this a decade ago and then there'll be a lower tax
[1:35:34.360 --> 1:35:37.880]  and fees and all the rest of it it's the insurance companies owned by the big
[1:35:37.880 --> 1:35:41.480]  banks that are running this so again try to pull that up
[1:35:41.480 --> 1:35:46.040]  nationalpost.com just say national post in the search box
[1:35:46.040 --> 1:35:51.240]  and then type in driverless vehicles will lower insurance rates
[1:35:51.240 --> 1:35:56.280]  and that should pull it up or i can try it but the reason i get into that is
[1:35:56.280 --> 1:36:00.120]  here's this new article first state legalizes
[1:36:00.120 --> 1:36:04.920]  taser drones for cops thanks to a lobbyist
[1:36:04.920 --> 1:36:09.960]  north dakota the daily beast so it's crowd control folks
[1:36:09.960 --> 1:36:13.160]  here's one out of the wall street journal this will illustrate everything
[1:36:13.160 --> 1:36:16.920]  before a robot takes your job you'll be working side by side
[1:36:16.920 --> 1:36:22.760]  so cops before a robot or a drone takes your job you'll be working side by side
[1:36:22.760 --> 1:36:26.360]  fighter pilots before a drone takes your job you'll be working
[1:36:26.360 --> 1:36:29.880]  side by side and again people can say well that's just the natural
[1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:33.720]  move of technology and technology usually empowers not enslave's
[1:36:33.720 --> 1:36:37.640]  i agree with that except now under the technocracy
[1:36:37.640 --> 1:36:45.400]  this is being done specifically do you guys find the national post story
[1:36:45.400 --> 1:36:48.520]  i get an obsession with this i've got to find it you guys are awesome usually
[1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:50.920]  find stuff so quick let me see if i can do it
[1:36:50.920 --> 1:36:55.320]  are you searching wherever you're searching news
[1:36:55.320 --> 1:36:59.320]  all right i would try to search news let me try to give you the exact headline
[1:36:59.320 --> 1:37:02.600]  sometimes it's different the paper than online and sometimes the stories that
[1:37:02.600 --> 1:37:07.720]  are in the paper aren't online as roads
[1:37:07.720 --> 1:37:12.120]  go driverless it's just a foregone conclusion
[1:37:12.120 --> 1:37:20.440]  insurance companies may be obsolete national post
[1:37:21.080 --> 1:37:26.600]  or just do driverless cars and national post click news
[1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:29.800]  doesn't matter i'm just putting it out for everybody else so they can find it
[1:37:29.800 --> 1:37:33.160]  as well so that's where this is going this is being done
[1:37:33.160 --> 1:37:38.840]  to displace humanity this is being done as a decision as a planned
[1:37:38.840 --> 1:37:42.440]  architecture like you build a big building
[1:37:42.440 --> 1:37:45.480]  it's being built in that we're obsolete that's a crime
[1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:49.320]  this gives incredible centralized control that's why it's a problem of
[1:37:49.320 --> 1:37:52.680]  course there's arguments for all of it
[1:37:52.680 --> 1:37:55.880]  but you notice they're trying to get lost past restrict citizens from having
[1:37:55.880 --> 1:37:59.880]  drones or again only the system has it so there's that as well
[1:37:59.880 --> 1:38:04.360]  let's go to rob in main rob you're on the air
[1:38:04.360 --> 1:38:09.000]  hi alex i want to make a couple of points here
[1:38:09.000 --> 1:38:14.840]  this guy uh the shooter and the the mind control drugs that have been used
[1:38:14.840 --> 1:38:20.440]  but uh first i'd like to say uh thank god for larry nickles and the clinton
[1:38:20.440 --> 1:38:26.200]  chronicles uh as a public access tv producer i have read that
[1:38:26.200 --> 1:38:31.240]  film three or four times over the years done this for 12 years
[1:38:31.240 --> 1:38:34.680]  and uh i'd like to say mr misses america
[1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:38.680]  you gotta see that film the clinton chronicles
[1:38:38.680 --> 1:38:42.280]  so i loved your rant on hillary this morning
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:47.320]  or earlier that was great i can't stand seeing those people and then the
[1:38:47.320 --> 1:38:52.920]  bushes coming back to these two dynasties it just makes me sick
[1:38:52.920 --> 1:38:57.560]  but the shooter definitely looks like a manchurian candidate
[1:38:57.560 --> 1:39:00.920]  all the hallmarks of it you know the way they worked in that the race
[1:39:00.920 --> 1:39:04.680]  angle as well as the you know the random shooting and
[1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:07.960]  yes he'll be on a psychotropic drug or something
[1:39:07.960 --> 1:39:12.520]  but um there is one point that i kind of been bothering me the suboxone there
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:15.800]  was a picture earlier on one of the articles that you were showing
[1:39:15.800 --> 1:39:20.120]  uh it's a suboxone and that i don't believe that is really in that class
[1:39:20.120 --> 1:39:24.120]  of drugs uh i i had to use that myself for a couple
[1:39:24.120 --> 1:39:28.440]  of years to get off of pills that i got hooked when i went to the dentist on
[1:39:28.440 --> 1:39:33.400]  vika then and stuff and uh they used that to wean people off of
[1:39:33.400 --> 1:39:38.840]  opiates and um so it it's it's like an opiate but they tell you you can't get
[1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:43.080]  high on of course but it has an amnesic effect for a lot of people
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:47.160]  uh i i really couldn't say that may be true but i don't believe
[1:39:47.160 --> 1:39:51.400]  i'm pretty sure it's not in the same class as uh these other things like up
[1:39:51.400 --> 1:39:55.320]  the serotonin reuptake inhibitors it's not uh
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:39:59.640]  so yeah it's more like an opiate itself it's kind of like that
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:06.280]  replaced the old uh methadone so yeah uh that was my point on that
[1:40:06.280 --> 1:40:10.120]  suboxone i think there's a little confusion about that but
[1:40:10.120 --> 1:40:14.840]  yeah this guy looks like a manchurian candidate all the way because uh
[1:40:14.840 --> 1:40:19.000]  i think 95 percent of these guys are well we know that the
[1:40:19.000 --> 1:40:22.600]  shooter in colorado was we have all the proof it's stunning they did it just
[1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:26.120]  like serhan serhan he told the jailers that he told people to
[1:40:26.120 --> 1:40:29.480]  sell next and i'm drugged i'm part of a secret government program i don't know
[1:40:29.480 --> 1:40:33.320]  what happened help me and then the feds grabbed him
[1:40:33.320 --> 1:40:37.240]  um and then he was in a secret government program it came out
[1:40:37.240 --> 1:40:39.880]  he was given almost a hundred thousand dollars a year but the feds his dad was
[1:40:39.880 --> 1:40:43.160]  in a super secret program he was under a top
[1:40:43.160 --> 1:40:46.280]  air force psychiatrist they knew what was going to happen
[1:40:46.280 --> 1:40:49.480]  he was totally shut up i don't think he was even the shooter thank you for the
[1:40:49.480 --> 1:40:52.840]  call great points by the way let me add one more chapter to this and i'm going
[1:40:52.840 --> 1:40:57.240]  back to your calls before a robot takes your job
[1:40:57.240 --> 1:41:01.240]  you will be working side by side with one wall street journal and it goes to
[1:41:01.240 --> 1:41:05.320]  the studies from foster research
[1:41:06.600 --> 1:41:11.240]  breaking all of this down in an oxford paper and a bunch of other major
[1:41:11.240 --> 1:41:17.560]  studies well here's landcaster online uber to work with u of a on
[1:41:17.560 --> 1:41:21.000]  mapping self-driving cars uber to work
[1:41:21.000 --> 1:41:26.040]  with them to basically phase out their own drivers
[1:41:26.040 --> 1:41:31.320]  see it when uber first came out a few years ago
[1:41:31.320 --> 1:41:33.960]  i didn't think it through because i didn't know that
[1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:37.160]  rama manuals brother ezequiel a manual has a hundred million dollar
[1:41:37.160 --> 1:41:40.440]  investment and it's already made two billion
[1:41:40.440 --> 1:41:46.600]  that hadn't happened yet i didn't know that they were exempt from all the laws
[1:41:46.600 --> 1:41:51.800]  but what they do all over the world in mainly liberal or socialist cities
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:54.360]  with mayors as they come in and give them massive money
[1:41:54.360 --> 1:41:59.080]  they give money to local political group they keep all the regulations on the
[1:41:59.080 --> 1:42:02.200]  taxi drivers for multi hundred thousand dollar a year
[1:42:02.200 --> 1:42:06.440]  medallions to be able to operate all the regulations all the controls
[1:42:06.440 --> 1:42:10.680]  can only drive 10 hours a day have to pay these huge fees when you go to the
[1:42:10.680 --> 1:42:16.280]  airport but then uber is allowed to bypass
[1:42:16.280 --> 1:42:21.640]  all of that so see it's not privatization it's not competition
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:24.760]  even though i can't stand a lot of the cab drivers now corrupt they are in the
[1:42:24.760 --> 1:42:28.280]  mafia connections there but that's a smaller older mafia
[1:42:28.280 --> 1:42:34.200]  generally they are set there to not be able to
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:38.760]  make profits to still pay all the taxes and then insider groups
[1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:44.200]  that own uber they are allowed to do things that the other
[1:42:44.200 --> 1:42:48.600]  companies like uber aren't allowed to either they're the designated winner
[1:42:48.600 --> 1:42:51.800]  they're the ones that get left alone everywhere but
[1:42:51.800 --> 1:42:58.040]  paris france san francisco you name it they come in they're above the law they
[1:42:58.040 --> 1:43:01.480]  don't have to pay the taxes have to pay the regulations
[1:43:01.480 --> 1:43:06.200]  but then the cab drivers do and then you hear from the owner of the ceo the
[1:43:06.200 --> 1:43:10.120]  founder of uber that oh we're going to have all the cars be uber
[1:43:10.120 --> 1:43:13.560]  we want a monopoly and we're going to dominate google
[1:43:13.560 --> 1:43:17.960]  and we're going to have driverless cars and then you understand what it's about
[1:43:17.960 --> 1:43:20.920]  you find out governments are involved with them
[1:43:20.920 --> 1:43:28.520]  as the knighted bespoke touched above the law group
[1:43:28.520 --> 1:43:35.320]  that is then going to be given the driverless car franchise
[1:43:35.320 --> 1:43:39.000]  and there'll be a few other subsidiaries owned by the very same people
[1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.200]  then there's the war over your future driverless car service
[1:43:42.200 --> 1:43:46.680]  has begun ubers acquisition of 100 microsoft mapping
[1:43:46.680 --> 1:43:51.240]  engineers puts google in the crosshairs you see
[1:43:51.240 --> 1:43:55.800]  they want to be the new google they've said that but it won't be a person
[1:43:55.800 --> 1:44:00.600]  opening the car door for you and they're allowed to make super massive
[1:44:00.600 --> 1:44:05.880]  profits because they are exempt from all the other
[1:44:05.880 --> 1:44:10.520]  rules that they themselves their controllers have put in place
[1:44:10.520 --> 1:44:14.120]  and then no matter what you do they stay above the law because billions are
[1:44:14.120 --> 1:44:19.080]  rolling in to the insiders and then the uber drivers themselves
[1:44:19.080 --> 1:44:22.680]  go out buy a new car do this they can be dismissed they'll say oh
[1:44:22.680 --> 1:44:26.760]  we found out three years ago you had a speeding ticket
[1:44:26.760 --> 1:44:33.400]  you didn't tell us about that we're with revoking for a year or for two years
[1:44:33.400 --> 1:44:36.920]  oh and they don't have to pay taxes they don't have to pay insurance
[1:44:36.920 --> 1:44:41.640]  all their workers are contractors at uber
[1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:46.520]  and so again the taxis have to be part of a union they have to have all the
[1:44:46.520 --> 1:44:50.120]  this bonding they have to pay for everything they have to be on the hook
[1:44:50.120 --> 1:44:53.800]  they get written the tickets but then when it comes to uber
[1:44:53.800 --> 1:44:56.760]  again like walmart it's screwing everybody over
[1:44:56.760 --> 1:45:01.560]  so uber may be a great alternative to taxis it does bring some competition to
[1:45:01.560 --> 1:45:04.520]  taxis but it's not level playing field and it's
[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:08.360]  very unfair and uber itself is a very draconian
[1:45:08.360 --> 1:45:12.280]  anti-free market monopolistic fascistic company
[1:45:12.280 --> 1:45:15.880]  in my humble view let's go to the phone calls
[1:45:15.880 --> 1:45:21.160]  ben in missouri you're on the air hey alex um i agree with you completely
[1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:24.280]  about uber though uh increment incrementally you know
[1:45:24.280 --> 1:45:27.080]  they'll designate more and more roads to be
[1:45:27.080 --> 1:45:31.720]  you know uh driverless cars only and then they'll give those areas the tax
[1:45:31.720 --> 1:45:35.080]  raise breaks and they'll build up those areas until
[1:45:35.080 --> 1:45:39.560]  anybody who doesn't want to be on a driverless uh car system won't even be
[1:45:39.560 --> 1:45:42.600]  able to live and work and it's all a part of the uh
[1:45:42.600 --> 1:45:45.480]  they admit that's their plan they admit that's their plan that's what's so
[1:45:45.480 --> 1:45:48.280]  frustrating people think i keep predicting stuff
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:51.400]  you know a decade or two before i'm not they have an admitted
[1:45:51.400 --> 1:45:54.440]  rollout plan i mean i remember 10 years ago
[1:45:54.440 --> 1:45:58.440]  or more reading that they would just raise insurance on driver cars human
[1:45:58.440 --> 1:46:02.440]  cars until we go bankrupt just like coal power plants
[1:46:02.440 --> 1:46:05.640]  the and they're just going to do it and then uber and a few other companies
[1:46:05.640 --> 1:46:09.640]  like google are going to have the monopoly or the oligopoly on it
[1:46:09.640 --> 1:46:13.080]  it's highway robbery and then it brings total control
[1:46:13.080 --> 1:46:17.320]  centralization everything's automated and run by the central computers
[1:46:17.320 --> 1:46:20.680]  controlled by the technocracy that's why the globalist
[1:46:20.680 --> 1:46:24.680]  at club of rome in the 60s and zebina brzezinski in the 70s
[1:46:24.680 --> 1:46:28.680]  in the technotronic era say we're going to build a world government
[1:46:28.680 --> 1:46:31.960]  run by a technocracy controlled by computers
[1:46:31.960 --> 1:46:34.680]  then they sell the idea through zeitgeist and the rest of it
[1:46:34.680 --> 1:46:40.520]  the new york times endorses that oh we're doing all this because it empowers
[1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:44.440]  humanity no it doesn't and computers they're
[1:46:44.440 --> 1:46:48.360]  they're not racist computers just do the right thing no they don't
[1:46:48.360 --> 1:46:51.640]  they do as they're programmed but see in the new
[1:46:51.640 --> 1:46:55.400]  political correctness saying the computers will make all the decisions
[1:46:55.400 --> 1:46:59.240]  show that there's no racism involved you understand and now they're saying
[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:05.160]  it's racist against computers if you warn of the bad uses of technology
[1:47:05.160 --> 1:47:08.440]  how do you like that so there's going to be laws when they start claiming
[1:47:08.440 --> 1:47:13.560]  computers are sent to it that you can't criticize them how's that sound
[1:47:13.560 --> 1:47:16.520]  well i certainly wouldn't want to be racist against the computer and i
[1:47:16.520 --> 1:47:20.040]  certainly wouldn't think that uh you know any of the loving
[1:47:20.040 --> 1:47:23.480]  insurance companies would you know want to make anybody go broke they've been
[1:47:23.480 --> 1:47:28.280]  so good for the country so far um as far as the shooting goes
[1:47:28.280 --> 1:47:31.320]  uh i mean there's not much that i can really say that
[1:47:31.320 --> 1:47:35.800]  it hasn't already been covered here ad nauseam i mean
[1:47:35.800 --> 1:47:38.760]  it fits the narrative it pushes the racial division
[1:47:38.760 --> 1:47:42.440]  and they know now that uh the charleston has settled down
[1:47:42.440 --> 1:47:45.480]  but you know maybe we can get all these people to turn in their guns if the
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:48.040]  shoes on the other foot maybe we'll have this
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:53.000]  guy shoot a white person and now you'll know you'll see the black on white
[1:47:53.000 --> 1:47:56.760]  violence and maybe that'll get the white people to turn in their guns
[1:47:56.760 --> 1:48:00.680]  uh and you know obviously like i said pushing the racial division
[1:48:00.680 --> 1:48:04.760]  it completely fits the narrative and in my opinion something really stinks
[1:48:04.760 --> 1:48:10.040]  about this entire situation i don't i can't even really
[1:48:10.040 --> 1:48:14.360]  think of a mass shooting quote unquote or a high-profile shooting like this
[1:48:14.360 --> 1:48:18.200]  that didn't seem like there was something more going on
[1:48:18.200 --> 1:48:21.400]  well there's been some of them that we caught red-handed being staged
[1:48:21.400 --> 1:48:27.320]  sir hand sir hand uh with rfk uh the situation a few years ago at the aurora
[1:48:27.320 --> 1:48:30.920]  shooting i mean those were staged we caught them
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:34.920]  we know exactly what they did it's unbelievable uh and then you look at
[1:48:34.920 --> 1:48:38.520]  sandy hook it just isn't real i don't know
[1:48:38.520 --> 1:48:43.000]  what specifically happened but the official story is a fairytale
[1:48:43.000 --> 1:48:47.080]  i mean jack of the beanstalk isn't real santa claus isn't real
[1:48:47.080 --> 1:48:52.520]  and that is a giant theater operation complete with blue screens
[1:48:52.520 --> 1:48:56.360]  and now even rob do's uncle who's of navy seal
[1:48:56.360 --> 1:49:02.920]  um retired fbi works for a big company we have a reporter up there and it's
[1:49:02.920 --> 1:49:07.400]  like that's rob do's uncle and he's like yeah
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:10.040]  done that up something's going on ever seen anything like this
[1:49:10.040 --> 1:49:13.160]  there's no paperwork they're covering something up i can't talk gotta get out
[1:49:13.160 --> 1:49:16.680]  of here so i mean that's how twilight zone this
[1:49:16.680 --> 1:49:21.160]  has gotten that there's like navy seal fbi agents
[1:49:21.160 --> 1:49:27.080]  looking into this and then former top school safety heads
[1:49:27.080 --> 1:49:30.360]  are investigating it and saying this isn't real
[1:49:30.360 --> 1:49:35.560]  this isn't real this isn't real i appreciate your call
[1:49:35.560 --> 1:49:39.080]  and look it shows how bold they are plant parenthood said we don't sell the
[1:49:39.080 --> 1:49:41.880]  body parts and make money now they've been caught making money on the new

[1:54:21.720 --> 1:54:25.160]  devil in disguise
[1:54:25.160 --> 1:54:28.920]  i didn't mean to go off into a rant about driving those cars it just shows
[1:54:28.920 --> 1:54:32.280]  how those of us that love innovation love competition see
[1:54:32.280 --> 1:54:35.400]  something like uber and i didn't research uber
[1:54:35.400 --> 1:54:40.760]  the last few years i just said hey it comes quicker they're nicer i love it
[1:54:40.760 --> 1:54:43.720]  and then i found out oh my gosh it's above the law
[1:54:43.720 --> 1:54:46.840]  gets to do whatever it wants and it's anti
[1:54:46.840 --> 1:54:49.480]  driver
[1:54:50.280 --> 1:54:54.840]  and they won't let the taxi companies out of the control they're under
[1:54:54.840 --> 1:54:58.360]  that's how the new world order operates they're always exempt from
[1:54:58.360 --> 1:55:01.960]  everything they're above the law they get to do whatever
[1:55:01.960 --> 1:55:04.680]  they want and then the globalists get the profits
[1:55:04.680 --> 1:55:08.120]  and it's all about basically making humans obsolete
[1:55:08.120 --> 1:55:11.880]  how about we make globalist obsolete
[1:55:11.880 --> 1:55:16.360]  i've got huge financial news i need to get to politics news all the things
[1:55:16.360 --> 1:55:19.480]  we're getting distracted from right now but this shooting is important because
[1:55:19.480 --> 1:55:22.840]  it's about survival if we don't expose the fact
[1:55:22.840 --> 1:55:27.080]  that this was racially motivated and all part of the race war hype coming out
[1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:31.080]  of the white house we will be collectively blamed
[1:55:31.080 --> 1:55:36.520]  for this that's why i get so angry is i am sick of being blamed for what
[1:55:36.520 --> 1:55:39.240]  somebody else does if some white guy goes
[1:55:39.240 --> 1:55:42.840]  and kills nine black people i didn't do it
[1:55:42.840 --> 1:55:45.960]  and if some black guy goes and shoots two white people
[1:55:45.960 --> 1:55:50.360]  black people didn't do that either but the folks that are
[1:55:50.360 --> 1:55:54.040]  hyping it up collectively that when a black person kills a white person
[1:55:54.040 --> 1:56:00.120]  or a black person kills a white person vice versa that it's the group's fault
[1:56:00.120 --> 1:56:04.360]  well yeah i mean if you're part of isis and isis goes around killing people
[1:56:04.360 --> 1:56:07.640]  you share responsibility but if i'm part of a
[1:56:07.640 --> 1:56:11.800]  racial ethnic group and someone in my quote group does something
[1:56:11.800 --> 1:56:15.000]  they're their own person and i know our audience gets that
[1:56:15.000 --> 1:56:18.760]  but we have to explain this to all the leftist followers
[1:56:18.760 --> 1:56:23.640]  who really mean well but have bought into the guilt as children
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:27.880]  that they've done something wrong and separately the minorities then get a
[1:56:27.880 --> 1:56:33.320]  chip on their shoulder some of them and their whole world is through those
[1:56:33.320 --> 1:56:36.840]  goggles through that distortion that everybody's out to get them
[1:56:36.840 --> 1:56:39.560]  i mean if you go work somewhere and you act like people are out to get you
[1:56:39.560 --> 1:56:42.280]  you're gonna have a big problem if you just are optimistic have a good
[1:56:42.280 --> 1:56:46.360]  attitude nine times out of ten even if you're working with a bunch of jerks
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:51.800]  you'll end up being successful and that's what it comes down to
[1:56:51.800 --> 1:56:54.600]  i mean i've run into plenty of racists in my life against white people i just
[1:56:54.600 --> 1:56:57.080]  laugh about it
[1:56:57.640 --> 1:57:01.080]  and i know a lot of quote minorities that are very successful everybody wants
[1:57:01.080 --> 1:57:03.880]  to hang around with them and stuff because they're just cool people
[1:57:03.880 --> 1:57:07.320]  they're not obsessed like the media wants them to be with a chip on their
[1:57:07.320 --> 1:57:10.280]  shoulder now we're going to start the next hour
[1:57:10.280 --> 1:57:12.920]  and i'm going to go directly to robert who's been holding everybody else

[2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:36.840]  the media decides what to make the big story though the footage is dramatic
[2:00:36.840 --> 2:00:40.040]  they're now demonizing the second amendment what do you expect to happen
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:42.680]  what's your take
[2:00:42.760 --> 2:00:46.360]  let me let me cover a couple subjects with you alex it's hard to get through
[2:00:46.360 --> 2:00:49.560]  with you and so just give me a couple minutes i'm going to cover a few things
[2:00:49.560 --> 2:00:53.640]  first that shooting i watched the footage want it looked like something
[2:00:53.640 --> 2:00:59.240]  between a nine millimeter and a 40 or 45 the 110 pound woman probably
[2:00:59.240 --> 2:01:03.000]  he pops her three times and she could still run off i'm questioning
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:06.840]  the validity of the footage number one number two
[2:01:06.840 --> 2:01:10.360]  charleston if you would if everybody would go to incendiary
[2:01:10.360 --> 2:01:14.280]  archive dot com i didn't show four days after charleston with
[2:01:14.280 --> 2:01:17.480]  kyle hunt from renegade broadcasting renegade
[2:01:17.480 --> 2:01:21.000]  tribune dot com and we deconstructed charleston
[2:01:21.000 --> 2:01:25.320]  every way from sunday hillary clinton would happen to be in town that day
[2:01:25.320 --> 2:01:29.800]  giving a campaign speech at the trident technical college
[2:01:29.800 --> 2:01:33.640]  there was a photographer with her named david goldman
[2:01:33.640 --> 2:01:37.560]  took all the photos of her at the trident college guess where he was
[2:01:37.560 --> 2:01:41.160]  that night he got all those nice prayer circle pictures
[2:01:41.160 --> 2:01:45.640]  david goldman got all that footage of federal law enforcement training
[2:01:45.640 --> 2:01:49.720]  centers active shooter drills in charleston from the
[2:01:49.720 --> 2:01:53.800]  15th to the 19th the hit went down on the 17th
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:58.280]  mayor riley of charleston which sits on the 33rd parallel by the way
[2:01:58.280 --> 2:02:03.080]  mayor riley sits on the mayor's against gun violence with
[2:02:03.080 --> 2:02:08.520]  mayor tom menino of boston the boston hopes bombing and guess who else michael
[2:02:08.520 --> 2:02:13.320]  bloomberg that guy's been in the mayor's ship of charleston since the 70s
[2:02:13.320 --> 2:02:17.800]  i got four pages worth of notes that deconstruct that as another gladio style
[2:02:17.800 --> 2:02:24.280]  false flag operation um the body of uh senator pink me laying in that casket
[2:02:24.280 --> 2:02:28.760]  was a joke it looked like a wax figure out of madame to sod
[2:02:28.760 --> 2:02:32.440]  and so charleston i think was a false flag and i
[2:02:32.440 --> 2:02:35.640]  you know there's so much research out there on the internet
[2:02:35.640 --> 2:02:41.080]  on charleston being a hoax now or i'm not saying anybody wasn't killed
[2:02:41.080 --> 2:02:44.920]  but you know they'll kill kill 3000 people in the world trade center
[2:02:44.920 --> 2:02:47.880]  they'll kill nine people in a church it's not a big deal to these people they're
[2:02:47.880 --> 2:02:52.120]  a bunch of stateless now clearly though if they're staged it why would they
[2:02:52.120 --> 2:02:55.960]  mix the racial thing in unless they're trying to trigger whites to go out and
[2:02:55.960 --> 2:02:59.960]  start killing blacks well no they were trying to stir up
[2:02:59.960 --> 2:03:03.560]  blacks because look at the war on the confederacy the confederate symbol
[2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:07.480]  no no no i know i know the shooting and i know the shooting in charleston was if
[2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:11.320]  it was staged i mean i know he wanted to start a race war he supposedly said
[2:03:11.320 --> 2:03:15.640]  i'm talking about why would they have a anti gun event like this
[2:03:15.640 --> 2:03:19.720]  and then make it basically have a narrative that makes black lives matter
[2:03:19.720 --> 2:03:23.560]  look bad here's the thing alex that kid was
[2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:27.560]  wearing a thousand dollar um ballistic vest i did a show with
[2:03:27.560 --> 2:03:31.080]  dr jim fesser where we deconstructed charleston it
[2:03:31.080 --> 2:03:35.720]  it looks very very bad and there's a ton of research on youtube and the internet
[2:03:35.720 --> 2:03:41.480]  about charleston now let me move on to 9 11 real quick i've been hearing you
[2:03:41.480 --> 2:03:45.160]  say lately the saudis quarterback 9 11 well i've
[2:03:45.160 --> 2:03:49.960]  got a stack of books that say the israelis um quarterback 9 11 there's 50
[2:03:49.960 --> 2:03:53.160]  times more evidence that the israelis who are
[2:03:53.160 --> 2:03:57.080]  joined at the hip by the with the saudis by the way wane madson's book
[2:03:57.080 --> 2:03:59.880]  really kind of covers that the sword and the star
[2:03:59.880 --> 2:04:03.800]  but i've got books upon books about the israelis the same people that hit us on
[2:04:03.800 --> 2:04:07.320]  the levana fair the uss liberty the sick jonathan
[2:04:07.320 --> 2:04:12.680]  pollard on us they did 9 11 uh victor thorn christopher bolin
[2:04:12.680 --> 2:04:16.760]  um edward henry's books they i mean if you read those books any of those books
[2:04:16.760 --> 2:04:21.080]  from any of those authors you're going to know that the israelis hit us on 9 11
[2:04:21.080 --> 2:04:26.840]  and then uh isis greater israel is the plan for isis they're creating a fake
[2:04:26.840 --> 2:04:31.800]  sui caliphate um to sit on top of the greater israel and i would suggest
[2:04:31.800 --> 2:04:37.560]  people look at moshe dayan and you know um what's his name um
[2:04:37.560 --> 2:04:41.400]  anyway all right very interesting robert very interesting i got to go
[2:04:41.400 --> 2:04:45.080]  here i appreciate your call we have exposed israel
[2:04:45.080 --> 2:04:48.360]  being involved with turkey and nato and others with isis
[2:04:48.360 --> 2:04:51.880]  uh but saudi arabia is involved as well so
[2:04:51.880 --> 2:04:56.440]  the whole crowd that hates israel always says that only israel's running stuff
[2:04:56.440 --> 2:05:00.520]  and it never anybody else that's my problem comedian bill burr recently
[2:05:00.520 --> 2:05:04.120]  shattered the left right paradigm of conan o bryan's audience
[2:05:04.120 --> 2:05:07.560]  and left them sitting in a stunned silence well i mean i don't think it
[2:05:07.560 --> 2:05:09.560]  matters who's president i'm one of those people
[2:05:09.560 --> 2:05:13.480]  sounds like it does it doesn't doesn't it doesn't matter at all
[2:05:13.480 --> 2:05:17.000]  hillary clinton goes to those bill de berg meetings
[2:05:17.000 --> 2:05:20.040]  it's like the illuminati stuff right she probably hooked up with some guy wearing
[2:05:20.040 --> 2:05:24.520]  like a goat's head and then she goes out on tv and she's talking to people who
[2:05:24.520 --> 2:05:28.920]  drive snow plows like she can relate to him burr also praised trump for his
[2:05:28.920 --> 2:05:32.280]  political incorrectness and regardless of what you think about
[2:05:32.280 --> 2:05:35.960]  trump as a presidential contender i think you very much should pay attention
[2:05:35.960 --> 2:05:40.520]  to what he said about how he's gained the system in the past before this before
[2:05:40.520 --> 2:05:44.360]  two months ago i was a businessman i give to everybody when they call i give
[2:05:44.360 --> 2:05:48.200]  and you know what when i need something from them two years later three years
[2:05:48.200 --> 2:05:52.520]  later i call them they are there for me and that's a broken

[2:08:35.560 --> 2:08:48.120]  it's fine but
[2:09:05.880 --> 2:09:12.280]  the globalists are preparing for war with the patriots of america
[2:09:12.280 --> 2:09:16.120]  the hard-working veterans of every race color and creed
[2:09:16.120 --> 2:09:19.560]  the patriots the people that want to keep taxes low people that want government
[2:09:19.560 --> 2:09:22.840]  to not be corrupt people that don't want foreign corporations a special
[2:09:22.840 --> 2:09:28.200]  interest running our nation armored vehicles paramilitaries fema camps
[2:09:28.200 --> 2:09:33.160]  reeducation centers they even use those terms and official army manuals
[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:38.120]  just type in army manual admits reeducation camps in u.s.
[2:09:38.120 --> 2:09:45.080]  it's declassified the babies being sold is public the cancer viruses and the
[2:09:45.080 --> 2:09:48.680]  vaccine is public they had met a hundred plus million
[2:09:48.680 --> 2:09:52.840]  people got cancer from the polio vaccine just type that in you'll read
[2:09:52.840 --> 2:09:56.760]  cdc documents from the 80s
[2:09:56.840 --> 2:10:00.920]  hundred million people got cancer
[2:10:00.920 --> 2:10:04.680]  it didn't a game
[2:10:05.320 --> 2:10:10.920]  it didn't a joke these people mean business
[2:10:11.160 --> 2:10:14.200]  and you ask why do they then hate the military of the militaries and power
[2:10:14.200 --> 2:10:17.800]  this new world order because the age of man's over
[2:10:17.800 --> 2:10:21.160]  the new technocracies here we're being phased out
[2:10:21.160 --> 2:10:25.800]  the elite don't need us anymore in their view well guess what we need us
[2:10:25.800 --> 2:10:29.560]  and we don't want to die fighting with each other over what color we are
[2:10:29.560 --> 2:10:31.800]  we want to unify and build a better world
[2:10:31.800 --> 2:10:36.360]  doesn't mean we're perfect but we got goodwill for humanity
[2:10:36.360 --> 2:10:41.880]  and another sour mentally ill probably narcissistic
[2:10:41.880 --> 2:10:46.920]  big baby just like the roof guy
[2:10:47.720 --> 2:10:51.560]  has gone in on video and shot two white people
[2:10:51.560 --> 2:10:56.920]  dramatically and yes of course it could be staged the global stage all sorts of
[2:10:56.920 --> 2:11:01.880]  stuff i don't know all i know is they're coming
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:05.240]  after the guns blaming us all collectively for the second
[2:11:05.240 --> 2:11:11.000]  amendment and it's a load of baloney and we need to explain and push back
[2:11:11.000 --> 2:11:14.360]  that gun crime is down despite the fact other crime is going up
[2:11:14.360 --> 2:11:19.640]  because guns are scaring violent criminals
[2:11:20.360 --> 2:11:24.280]  and all hell's starting to break loose as the economy melts down we need our
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:27.640]  guns now more than ever and the globalists know full well
[2:11:27.640 --> 2:11:30.600]  if they actually try to implement all these executive actions that are
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:34.600]  clearly unconstitutional nakedly tyrannical by obama
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:37.800]  it's going to start an event and that's why they're pushing us
[2:11:37.800 --> 2:11:43.560]  and baiting us and that's why i've said and been called a traitor
[2:11:43.560 --> 2:11:46.840]  by some of the infiltrated militia groups that
[2:11:46.840 --> 2:11:51.160]  i believe if gun confiscation starts
[2:11:51.160 --> 2:11:55.640]  at first at least we need to not get in
[2:11:55.640 --> 2:11:59.080]  firefights with the idiots that come to take the guns
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:03.240]  because they want to start a civil war
[2:12:03.240 --> 2:12:07.800]  if we can control ourselves and not yet in a civil war when they come to take
[2:12:07.800 --> 2:12:10.760]  the guns which they're already doing to veterans and others
[2:12:10.760 --> 2:12:14.280]  it'll be such a political backlash that things will change state governments
[2:12:14.280 --> 2:12:17.640]  will line up and say no then the feds will have to invade
[2:12:17.640 --> 2:12:23.960]  and then we'll have governmental legitimacy and leaders like 1776 in
[2:12:23.960 --> 2:12:27.000]  front of us if they really want to have a civil war
[2:12:27.000 --> 2:12:30.920]  to win it and then to reconstitute the republic the plans to bring down the
[2:12:30.920 --> 2:12:33.480]  country i'm going to say this before you shoot
[2:12:33.480 --> 2:12:37.160]  your mouth off about killing cops and military that come to take the guns
[2:12:37.160 --> 2:12:41.080]  you ought to be thinking about ways to hit them with information now
[2:12:41.080 --> 2:12:45.240]  so they have a debate first and won't take part in it
[2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:47.640]  and believe me they're already having that debate
[2:12:47.640 --> 2:12:51.800]  but it's easy to sit around and talk about civil war all day and
[2:12:51.800 --> 2:12:55.160]  we're going to shoot anybody that does this or that and the folks that talk
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:12:57.400]  about that all day they're going to be hiding
[2:12:57.400 --> 2:13:00.840]  or they're working for the other side when this thing kicks off
[2:13:00.840 --> 2:13:04.760]  i'll say this i'm not going any reeducation camp neither is my family
[2:13:04.760 --> 2:13:07.560]  and that's all i got to say folks i'm not going to sit here and shoot my mouth
[2:13:07.560 --> 2:13:12.200]  off to prepare for peace and to secure peace you
[2:13:12.200 --> 2:13:15.240]  must prepare for war
[2:13:16.680 --> 2:13:20.600]  and everything we do is an info war that's my role
[2:13:20.600 --> 2:13:24.280]  and yes people have listened and folks have spoken out
[2:13:24.280 --> 2:13:27.800]  and the public is armed to the teeth
[2:13:28.840 --> 2:13:32.920]  and i just want to say this again if they start persecuting us
[2:13:32.920 --> 2:13:37.560]  and physically trying to drag folks off just remember who's really responsible
[2:13:37.560 --> 2:13:40.680]  it's the big bank hedge the big foundation hedge
[2:13:40.680 --> 2:13:45.640]  they're the enemy they run it all they're the ones that did it
[2:13:45.640 --> 2:13:48.920]  you will not hurt them
[2:13:50.280 --> 2:13:53.960]  killing their minions they want to destroy the u.s military and police
[2:13:53.960 --> 2:13:57.720]  in the first wave normally in a war you'd want to grade their forces
[2:13:57.720 --> 2:14:04.120]  and you may have to just to survive and to make them go into an armored type
[2:14:04.120 --> 2:14:07.720]  situation where they hunker down
[2:14:07.720 --> 2:14:11.640]  but what will really make the new world order stop
[2:14:11.640 --> 2:14:15.160]  is if their own people at the top get in trouble i don't mean obama don't turn
[2:14:15.160 --> 2:14:19.720]  him into some type of martyr but if they launch all this stuff
[2:14:19.720 --> 2:14:23.880]  the people running the show the actual bureaucrats the actual
[2:14:23.880 --> 2:14:27.480]  corporate heads they're the enemy and what scares me more than anything what
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:30.280]  concerns me more than anything so we don't really call it even fear what
[2:14:30.280 --> 2:14:34.280]  makes me brace is the actual head people are
[2:14:34.280 --> 2:14:38.360]  resigning and leaving the last three four years and moving out and hiding out
[2:14:38.360 --> 2:14:42.520]  and changing their names because they know that they know we're coming for
[2:14:42.520 --> 2:14:45.560]  them if they actually pull all this and it's not
[2:14:45.560 --> 2:14:48.760]  something because i want to come for people or i want any of this to happen
[2:14:48.760 --> 2:14:54.920]  but you hurt us you put our people in camps you kill us
[2:14:54.920 --> 2:14:58.920]  i'll quote iron maiden you fire musket but i'm gonna run you through
[2:14:58.920 --> 2:15:02.840]  and i don't need guns to get that done and i'm not talking about me
[2:15:02.840 --> 2:15:07.000]  individually this spirit is going to tear you into pieces once you start to
[2:15:07.000 --> 2:15:09.560]  fight with it
[2:15:11.000 --> 2:15:14.120]  and they know that actually they want to kill freedom so bad
[2:15:14.120 --> 2:15:17.960]  they're willing to actually go up against the most vicious armed people
[2:15:17.960 --> 2:15:21.160]  the world's ever seen

[2:16:02.120 --> 2:16:07.800]  they are sworn enemies of the people i mean the folks running this
[2:16:07.800 --> 2:16:11.880]  want to kill us and you were right earlier when you
[2:16:11.880 --> 2:16:15.240]  said the weaponized media could get away with it
[2:16:15.240 --> 2:16:20.680]  they would never report that this shooter was on pharmaceutical lobotomy drugs
[2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:25.880]  that's right now i was born february 10th today before you were plus 20
[2:16:25.880 --> 2:16:30.120]  so i've got 20 years and a day on you i know that uh you choose your own
[2:16:30.120 --> 2:16:32.520]  bumper music i've heard you say that before
[2:16:32.520 --> 2:16:36.280]  but i'd like to quote uh if you have time the lyrics of a song written and
[2:16:36.280 --> 2:16:39.640]  published by um the late great francis
[2:16:39.640 --> 2:16:45.960]  vince zappa in 1973 oh i love frank zappa boy was he at his time go ahead
[2:16:45.960 --> 2:16:50.360]  he was he was um the the song uh published on
[2:16:50.360 --> 2:16:53.800]  it was on the overnight sensation album 1973
[2:16:53.800 --> 2:16:57.640]  the title of the song is i am the slime here's how it goes
[2:16:57.640 --> 2:17:02.360]  i am gross and perverted i'm dust and deranged i have existed for years but
[2:17:02.360 --> 2:17:05.560]  very little has changed i'm the tool of the government
[2:17:05.560 --> 2:17:08.840]  and industry too for i am destined to rule
[2:17:08.840 --> 2:17:13.320]  and regulate you i may be vile and pernicious but you can't look away
[2:17:13.320 --> 2:17:16.520]  i make you think i'm delicious with the stuff that i say
[2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:21.480]  i'm the best you can get have you guessed me yet i'm the slime losing out
[2:17:21.480 --> 2:17:25.160]  from your tv set you will obey me while i lead you
[2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:28.680]  eat the garbage that i feed you until the day that we don't need you
[2:17:28.680 --> 2:17:32.920]  don't go for help no one will heed you your mind is totally controlled
[2:17:32.920 --> 2:17:36.840]  it has been stuffed into my mold and you will do as you were told
[2:17:36.840 --> 2:17:41.560]  until the right to you are sold that's right folks don't touch that die
[2:17:41.560 --> 2:17:47.000]  well i am the slime from video who's doing a long one
[2:17:47.000 --> 2:17:50.120]  i you know what i love that song and and my problem is
[2:17:50.120 --> 2:17:53.320]  the i do choose like 98 percent of the bumper music
[2:17:53.320 --> 2:17:56.680]  and then so many times i write down songs i want to play i've had frank zappa's
[2:17:56.680 --> 2:17:59.880]  wife line uh i think i had dweasel on too yeah
[2:17:59.880 --> 2:18:04.760]  their listeners his son and i wanted to play that then there's never got around
[2:18:04.760 --> 2:18:07.720]  to it so i what's the name of that song again
[2:18:07.720 --> 2:18:11.880]  uh i am the slime on the overnight sensation album 1973
[2:18:11.880 --> 2:18:15.160]  we're gonna get the i am the slime try to play that at the bottom of the hour
[2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:17.960]  for you if we're able to do it with that particular
[2:18:17.960 --> 2:18:21.800]  lyrics piece yeah his dad was a chemical engineer he was super smart in his own
[2:18:21.800 --> 2:18:25.080]  right way ahead of his time transcending the
[2:18:25.080 --> 2:18:29.080]  left right paradigm and uh you know died of cancer very very young
[2:18:29.080 --> 2:18:36.040]  they say the good guy young bob marley died of cancer young
[2:18:36.040 --> 2:18:38.680]  and it's just a real bummer you gotta wonder i mean we know they killed john
[2:18:38.680 --> 2:18:44.120]  lennon i mean i know for a fact but the stuff i was told
[2:18:44.120 --> 2:18:47.080]  and then this is i am the slime we're gonna come back to the lyrics later
[2:18:47.080 --> 2:18:51.560]  the things i've been told about uh john lennon what happened to him i'm
[2:18:51.560 --> 2:18:55.560]  not allowed to tell anybody and that's part of being a journalist is you get
[2:18:55.560 --> 2:18:59.480]  told really dangerous really scary stuff
[2:18:59.480 --> 2:19:03.960]  and then you're not allowed to talk about it and i you know i don't blame
[2:19:03.960 --> 2:19:07.160]  people that know all this for not speaking out though because
[2:19:07.160 --> 2:19:11.720]  you know when the government sits in your living room
[2:19:11.720 --> 2:19:14.360]  and tells you if you talk about it they're gonna kill you and they've already
[2:19:14.360 --> 2:19:18.920]  killed people close to you you have a tendency to listen to them
[2:19:18.920 --> 2:19:22.520]  you wonder why so many wives and people like gary webb that was shot twice in
[2:19:22.520 --> 2:19:24.920]  the head he was killed he told people they're after me they're following me
[2:19:24.920 --> 2:19:28.200]  he had his book coming out i was talking to him he was vindicated
[2:19:28.200 --> 2:19:30.520]  and they said you're not gonna vindicate jack crap we're gonna come to your
[2:19:30.520 --> 2:19:32.760]  house and have you write out a deal that you know a
[2:19:32.760 --> 2:19:35.800]  suicide note we're gonna kill your family
[2:19:35.800 --> 2:19:38.040]  then they go to your wife and threaten her you know that's the thing that
[2:19:38.040 --> 2:19:42.040]  happened with uh michael hastings you know his wife
[2:19:42.040 --> 2:19:45.400]  biggs was at the funeral if you said oh go after him they killed him it's
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:48.600]  horrible a little bit later she went on pierce morgan and said
[2:19:48.600 --> 2:19:53.560]  you know no it was all big accident so they car bombed me and my family
[2:19:53.560 --> 2:19:57.320]  starts saying i it was an accident no it's not

[2:25:16.760 --> 2:25:23.400]  and i love how most of what we've said's come true unfortunately
[2:25:24.200 --> 2:25:26.920]  we've been able to hold back some stuff you know like i'm
[2:25:26.920 --> 2:25:30.760]  they're gonna register all your guns and then try to ban semi-autos and their
[2:25:30.760 --> 2:25:34.360]  bills fail by like two or three votes and people go
[2:25:34.360 --> 2:25:38.040]  who wants my guns the prediction didn't come true
[2:25:38.040 --> 2:25:42.680]  or you know this bubble could go any minute
[2:25:42.680 --> 2:25:46.120]  and then it doesn't go and then it's a year later it starts to go
[2:25:46.120 --> 2:25:49.720]  i mean the cbo is in the news today congressional budget office
[2:25:49.720 --> 2:25:53.560]  saying that it's unsustainable debt

[2:26:00.760 --> 2:26:04.520]  the time bomb is going to go off but it's crazy
[2:26:04.520 --> 2:26:08.440]  there's hundreds of times the global debt with derivatives that we actually
[2:26:08.440 --> 2:26:11.000]  have money
[2:26:11.000 --> 2:26:17.320]  people say oh really you know fear mongering so i want to go to him

[2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:31.480]  stop it and then we're here trying to put the fire out there going i thought
[2:26:31.480 --> 2:26:34.680]  she said it would burn the house down only part of the house is burned
[2:26:34.680 --> 2:26:38.360]  we've got fire hoses trying to put out we're like we know we know
[2:26:38.360 --> 2:26:43.080]  we're saying if we don't stop all this i mean i told you they'd weaponize drones
[2:26:43.080 --> 2:26:46.120]  it's in the news today
[2:26:46.440 --> 2:26:51.000]  i told you they try to pass laws banning gmo labeling it's it's it's look i know
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:53.800]  their agenda
[2:26:54.040 --> 2:26:58.120]  i know what their plan is i'm not perfect i'm trying to stop it
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:01.640]  i'm trying to get you involved to take action so i can't wait till we talk to
[2:27:01.640 --> 2:27:04.520]  that caller i want to go to Doug and others here in a moment
[2:27:04.520 --> 2:27:07.720]  briefly i've not been talking enough lately
[2:27:07.720 --> 2:27:12.440]  about survival shield nascent iodine x2 there's no other iodine like it
[2:27:12.440 --> 2:27:15.720]  it's absolutely pure it comes from a deep earth sourced
[2:27:15.720 --> 2:27:18.760]  not stuff that has to be processed out of seaweed
[2:27:18.760 --> 2:27:22.600]  it is in pure form and it just goes through grabbing bad halogens in your
[2:27:22.600 --> 2:27:25.960]  body and dragon amount it blocks it in some of the glands like the
[2:27:25.960 --> 2:27:30.120]  thyroid so the bad halogens like fluoride and chlorine
[2:27:30.120 --> 2:27:33.720]  that is just filling our environment can't get into it
[2:27:33.720 --> 2:27:37.880]  and massive energy increases massive libido increases
[2:27:37.880 --> 2:27:41.320]  my skin is so much healthier it really is amazing
[2:27:41.320 --> 2:27:44.520]  but it can have some serious effects if your thyroid's already in trouble and
[2:27:44.520 --> 2:27:47.800]  stuff if you talk to a physician before you do this or before you take larger
[2:27:47.800 --> 2:27:51.080]  dosages of it if you don't have iodine you'll die
[2:27:51.080 --> 2:27:55.240]  and most of it's contaminated or not pure and can't be absorbed
[2:27:55.240 --> 2:27:58.600]  nascent supposedly can be absorbed but most nascent we found is not really
[2:27:58.600 --> 2:28:02.840]  nascent this is what i call true nascent iodine
[2:28:02.840 --> 2:28:10.360]  infowarslife.com or info wars store.com
[2:28:10.440 --> 2:28:14.280]  and it really is essential that you try it bottom line you're helping the
[2:28:14.280 --> 2:28:17.240]  broadcast you're finding the operation but
[2:28:17.240 --> 2:28:21.160]  you can read the rave reviews it has a 4.9 review
[2:28:21.160 --> 2:28:25.800]  the overall products have a 4.8 thousands of them
[2:28:25.800 --> 2:28:32.440]  look the first review is 4.8 840 reviews of the nascent iodine alone
[2:28:32.440 --> 2:28:36.600]  thousands and thousands on the site itself by a major third party
[2:28:36.600 --> 2:28:40.040]  site power reviews one of the most respected out there
[2:28:40.040 --> 2:28:44.440]  texas stevo in austin texas i bought five of the old survival shields and
[2:28:44.440 --> 2:28:49.320]  info wars first sold and i have to say the first bottles were good
[2:28:49.320 --> 2:28:53.000]  but over time the color and taste faded

[2:30:06.200 --> 2:30:09.960]  over the weekend the airstrikes were called in after the taliban seized

[2:33:44.840 --> 2:33:46.840]  oh
[2:33:54.520 --> 2:34:01.000]  and october 2015 could be looked back on in years to come as the most tumultuous
[2:34:01.000 --> 2:34:05.480]  in generations the chinese economic meltdown is in full swing and its impact
[2:34:05.480 --> 2:34:10.200]  on the rest of the world is painful the economies of developing countries
[2:34:10.200 --> 2:34:15.960]  were the first to take the hit and now stock markets in 23 different countries
[2:34:15.960 --> 2:34:20.520]  around the world are crashing now it's our turn and it's going to be
[2:34:20.520 --> 2:34:24.520]  painful the dow jones just lost 6 in a week
[2:34:24.520 --> 2:34:30.600]  tumbling more than 1000 points the worst since 2008
[2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:34.600]  expect a short-term rally in response but the long-term picture
[2:34:34.600 --> 2:34:39.160]  is potentially devastating in fact some indications show that the dow has to
[2:34:39.160 --> 2:34:42.840]  drop to as low as 5000 before it reaches the bottom
[2:34:42.840 --> 2:34:46.840]  and even as investors resort to panic selling some sectors of the
[2:34:46.840 --> 2:34:51.240]  establishment financial media are still peddling this delusion
[2:34:51.240 --> 2:34:55.800]  that we're in a bull market analysts are still bullish on apple despite shares
[2:34:55.800 --> 2:34:59.000]  plummeting 20 percent from their all-time high
[2:34:59.000 --> 2:35:03.480]  cnbc is encouraging people to pour more money into the stock market
[2:35:03.480 --> 2:35:07.240]  claiming that the collapse is merely a dull year
[2:35:07.240 --> 2:35:12.120]  others are calling it a correction when this kind of blind faith begins to take
[2:35:12.120 --> 2:35:16.200]  hold you know that the bottom is about to drop out
[2:35:16.200 --> 2:35:20.360]  this is exactly what we saw back in 2006
[2:35:20.360 --> 2:35:24.440]  remember this there's no tax increase coming in the next couple of years
[2:35:24.440 --> 2:35:28.760]  monetary policy is spectacular we have freer trade than ever before
[2:35:28.760 --> 2:35:32.120]  and not only that but there are no incomes policies things here
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:35.560]  i think peter is just totally off base and i don't think it's going to be
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:38.760]  i mean i just don't know where he's getting his stuff the one of us is one
[2:35:38.760 --> 2:35:42.520]  of us is off base but it's definitely not me i mean it's not wealth that's
[2:35:42.520 --> 2:35:45.480]  increased in the last few years we haven't increased our productive
[2:35:45.480 --> 2:35:49.560]  capacity all that's increased is the paper values of our stocks in real
[2:35:49.560 --> 2:35:52.040]  estate but that's not real wealth no more than
[2:35:52.040 --> 2:35:56.120]  the nasdaq was wealth when you see the stock market come down and the real
[2:35:56.120 --> 2:35:59.800]  state bubble burst all that phony wealth is going to evaporate and all that's
[2:35:59.800 --> 2:36:03.240]  going to be left is all the debt that we accumulated to foreigners peter i'm
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:06.600]  going to take a bet with you on this one i'll bet you a penny on this one that
[2:36:06.600 --> 2:36:10.120]  if you'll sign a letter saying that if you're wrong you'll you'll sign a letter
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:13.560]  that you were wrong to me in this but you're just way off base there is
[2:36:13.560 --> 2:36:16.760]  nothing out there that tells us we're gonna have a nice slowdown but it's not
[2:36:16.760 --> 2:36:20.360]  going to be all right let me ask you this a lot more than a penny and just as
[2:36:20.360 --> 2:36:23.480]  they laughed at peter schiff back in 2006
[2:36:23.480 --> 2:36:27.000]  those warning of a coming collapse have been mocked
[2:36:27.000 --> 2:36:31.560]  into silence despite the fact that they're already being proven right
[2:36:31.560 --> 2:36:34.600]  oil prices which signal true economic health
[2:36:34.600 --> 2:36:39.000]  just suffered the longest streak of losses since 1986
[2:36:39.000 --> 2:36:44.680]  gold is soaring again as investors flee to safety the crisis is truly global
[2:36:44.680 --> 2:36:48.360]  the chinese meltdown has wrecked emerging economies
[2:36:48.360 --> 2:36:52.040]  with reduced demand causing currencies to plunge
[2:36:52.040 --> 2:36:56.680]  setting the stage for what the ap predicts could be a crippling fall
[2:36:56.680 --> 2:36:59.480]  but as peter schiff explains the chinese meltdown
[2:36:59.480 --> 2:37:03.560]  maybe to blame for the latest downturn but they're not telling you the whole
[2:37:03.560 --> 2:37:07.160]  story which is that this stock market bubble was not
[2:37:07.160 --> 2:37:11.480]  based on a real economic recovery it was based on the hot air
[2:37:11.480 --> 2:37:16.120]  of quantitative easing and artificially low interest rates
[2:37:16.120 --> 2:37:20.280]  once qe3 was tapered stocks went sideways
[2:37:20.280 --> 2:37:23.320]  and as soon as an interest rate rise was on the horizon
[2:37:23.320 --> 2:37:26.840]  they tanked because none of those gains were
[2:37:26.840 --> 2:37:31.000]  real it wasn't because the economy improved because we became more productive
[2:37:31.000 --> 2:37:34.680]  because of a genuine increase in corporate earnings it was all
[2:37:34.680 --> 2:37:38.840]  about fed engineering it was quantitative easing
[2:37:38.840 --> 2:37:42.520]  and zero percent interest rates those were the two props
[2:37:42.520 --> 2:37:45.640]  that the fed used to artificially prop up the market
[2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:51.160]  they've already removed one qe that's why the market has gained no ground
[2:37:51.160 --> 2:37:55.640]  since the fed ended qe and all of the post qe3 gains
[2:37:55.640 --> 2:37:59.160]  have been eradicated the market has gone sideways
[2:37:59.160 --> 2:38:04.120]  since the fed took away the first prop but the markets have still been teetering
[2:38:04.120 --> 2:38:07.080]  on the second prop which is zero interest rates
[2:38:07.080 --> 2:38:10.120]  but now everybody thinks the fed is going to remove that prop well then
[2:38:10.120 --> 2:38:13.080]  there's nothing beneath the market but a bunch of air
[2:38:13.080 --> 2:38:17.000]  right and the market is going to tank we're seeing a global currency war
[2:38:17.000 --> 2:38:21.080]  emerge as developing countries desperately try to make their exports
[2:38:21.080 --> 2:38:25.960]  more attractive by devaluing their currencies september and october
[2:38:25.960 --> 2:38:29.800]  are really shaping what's going to be hidden or not
[2:38:29.800 --> 2:38:37.800]  i am crossing the verdict i'm obsessed and deranged i have existed for years
[2:38:37.800 --> 2:38:44.120]  but every rule has changed i'm the tool of the government
[2:38:44.120 --> 2:38:49.560]  and in the street before i understand the rule
[2:38:49.560 --> 2:38:55.080]  and regulate you i need you to file and punish us
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:39:00.360]  but you can't walk away i think you think i'm delicious
[2:39:00.360 --> 2:39:05.880]  with the stuff that's frank zappa bringing us in with the slime
[2:39:05.880 --> 2:39:09.000]  guys did great job grabbing it quickly off the internet but did not cause kind
[2:39:09.000 --> 2:39:13.240]  of the glitch coming in so we aired part of a paul watson report here this is
[2:39:13.240 --> 2:39:19.000]  live three hours of radio slash tv uh to counter the
[2:39:19.000 --> 2:39:21.720]  establishment media and we didn't have any train wrecks today
[2:39:21.720 --> 2:39:25.640]  our crew does a great job compared to folks getting shot obviously
[2:39:25.640 --> 2:39:29.000]  in virginia very tragic i'm very sad for their two deaths
[2:39:29.000 --> 2:39:33.320]  uh the video first person point of view shooting
[2:39:33.320 --> 2:39:37.240]  by a deranged apparently racist black guy
[2:39:37.240 --> 2:39:40.840]  very similar to the shooting situation
[2:39:40.840 --> 2:39:46.360]  uh that happened in charleston except that was even more cold-blooded because
[2:39:46.360 --> 2:39:49.800]  the young man in question didn't know eight of the
[2:39:49.800 --> 2:39:55.880]  nine people he shot but it's this whole race war where the problems in our
[2:39:55.880 --> 2:39:59.400]  life are people of other colors not the economic
[2:39:59.400 --> 2:40:02.760]  policies not what's actually happening in the world
[2:40:02.760 --> 2:40:06.680]  julia toryanski uh is a very interesting documentary film maker
[2:40:06.680 --> 2:40:11.080]  radio tv host brave the world dot com we've been covering her stuff for years
[2:40:11.080 --> 2:40:14.600]  you know as paul watson's interviewer uh quite a bit she's been here in austin
[2:40:14.600 --> 2:40:18.440]  last week and so i thought well why not have her in studio talk about
[2:40:18.440 --> 2:40:23.480]  feminism and some of the topics that are taking place but now we have this
[2:40:23.480 --> 2:40:26.680]  big mass shooting that's happened i promise to go to your calls but now
[2:40:26.680 --> 2:40:29.320]  there are about five minutes behind i'm gonna have to do a little bit of
[2:40:29.320 --> 2:40:32.440]  overdrive uh to be able to finish those so we'll
[2:40:32.440 --> 2:40:36.280]  we'll do that as well for doug and others that have been patiently holding
[2:40:36.280 --> 2:40:40.280]  again i'm alex shown's your host there is a big push to demonize the second
[2:40:40.280 --> 2:40:44.280]  amendment there is a big push obviously to demonize people being able to
[2:40:44.280 --> 2:40:47.720]  defend themselves julia what do you want to tackle first
[2:40:47.720 --> 2:40:50.760]  i mean there's a lot of issues a lot of news you cover a lot of
[2:40:50.760 --> 2:40:54.760]  different angles you try to get uh off of the
[2:40:54.760 --> 2:40:58.520]  uh paradigm and you know get off the left right
[2:40:58.520 --> 2:41:03.800]  reservation where do you see the world going well i just came from san francisco
[2:41:03.800 --> 2:41:07.720]  to austin which has been a really incredible culture shock in
[2:41:07.720 --> 2:41:11.560]  kind of a positive direction and as you mentioned san francisco has this
[2:41:11.560 --> 2:41:15.480]  incredible homelessness problem and it's just an example of how
[2:41:15.480 --> 2:41:19.640]  governments compound and augment problems that they claim to
[2:41:19.640 --> 2:41:24.280]  to have been fixing so what happens in san francisco specifically is
[2:41:24.280 --> 2:41:28.040]  they ship places like new york give homeless people
[2:41:28.040 --> 2:41:32.520]  one way ticket to a bus and ship them to a warmer place like san francisco and
[2:41:32.520 --> 2:41:35.640]  they all go there because san francisco spends a hundred
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:41.720]  sixty seven million dollars a year on their homeless but
[2:41:41.720 --> 2:41:44.920]  then they take away basic services like public toilets
[2:41:44.920 --> 2:41:49.160]  because of the fear of drug use and confined private spaces
[2:41:49.160 --> 2:41:53.800]  so they ship all the homeless there they make the illusion of providing services
[2:41:53.800 --> 2:41:56.680]  and taking care of them and then they take away public toilets
[2:41:56.680 --> 2:42:02.200]  and then you get what you get drudge has the image it's an epidemic of people
[2:42:02.200 --> 2:42:06.040]  defecating on the streets it is i've been there
[2:42:06.040 --> 2:42:08.520]  i've seen it
[2:42:09.240 --> 2:42:12.360]  i mean the last few times i went to san francisco it's really creepy now it
[2:42:12.360 --> 2:42:15.640]  looks like a zombie apocalypse with just bombed out of their brain or
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:18.680]  mentally ill homeless people wandering around everywhere
[2:42:18.680 --> 2:42:22.200]  basically crapping on themselves and i guess this is the liberal heaven
[2:42:22.200 --> 2:42:25.560]  yeah and the entirety of california i mean i i can't speak for
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:29.480]  each individual but they're all hypocrites you look at
[2:42:29.480 --> 2:42:33.560]  they're all uh claiming to be anti-racist but they
[2:42:33.560 --> 2:42:37.080]  they totally back plant parenthood which is a
[2:42:37.080 --> 2:42:40.920]  anti-black eugenics uh eugenics program
[2:42:40.920 --> 2:42:45.240]  originally uh you can look that up margess uh margaret sanger and
[2:42:45.240 --> 2:42:48.600]  out there it's not even conspiracy theory they
[2:42:48.600 --> 2:42:54.360]  claim to be tolerant but if you disagree with them they just get infuriated
[2:42:54.360 --> 2:42:57.800]  start yelling you they claim to be feminist yet they don't
[2:42:57.800 --> 2:43:01.160]  support gun rights and gun rights and gun ownership
[2:43:01.160 --> 2:43:05.400]  is actually congruent with feminism and i think gun ownership is actually
[2:43:05.400 --> 2:43:08.840]  contingent of true equality not sameness
[2:43:08.840 --> 2:43:12.600]  absolutely why does government and rich people on elites get to have guns
[2:43:12.600 --> 2:43:15.960]  and bodyguards but then we don't individually get to have them that's
[2:43:15.960 --> 2:43:18.760]  just outrageous and how dare hillary with all these
[2:43:18.760 --> 2:43:22.280]  armed guards say that you or i can't have guns now tell folks a little bit
[2:43:22.280 --> 2:43:26.360]  about yourself as we google your name we can see you there posing with guns
[2:43:26.360 --> 2:43:29.720]  and then and that's always exciting to see folks doing that
[2:43:29.720 --> 2:43:33.480]  i mean it's just so no-brainer if you want to empower women
[2:43:33.480 --> 2:43:36.520]  who on average aren't as physically strong as men
[2:43:36.520 --> 2:43:41.560]  and historically get preyed on by bad men why the first thing you do
[2:43:41.560 --> 2:43:46.440]  is try to get women in mma and get women armed but no no the left doesn't want
[2:43:46.440 --> 2:43:49.560]  that they want the state to be the woman's pimp
[2:43:49.560 --> 2:43:53.960]  yeah alex they run all these anti-rape campaigns and vilify men and think
[2:43:53.960 --> 2:43:57.720]  there's a you know one out of every three men or is a rapist
[2:43:57.720 --> 2:44:02.120]  and then they take your guns away as a woman i'm like 120 pounds
[2:44:02.120 --> 2:44:05.800]  if i'm at home alone especially with my little kids
[2:44:05.800 --> 2:44:09.720]  or my family you know people who are dependent on me for protection
[2:44:09.720 --> 2:44:15.720]  and someone breaks into my home i am almost i'm very likely to be less
[2:44:15.720 --> 2:44:21.080]  physically able to protect myself than a man than a
[2:44:21.080 --> 2:44:26.680]  grown man most men can physically take me i need a gun to equalize me i need it
[2:44:26.680 --> 2:44:30.920]  because if i don't even if he has a gun at least one in even playing field
[2:44:30.920 --> 2:44:34.760]  guns are an incredible liberator right and people don't understand that and
[2:44:34.760 --> 2:44:38.200]  to me the whole gun debate is over you can print a gun you can
[2:44:38.200 --> 2:44:41.400]  even before you could print a gun you can just make a gun at home
[2:44:41.400 --> 2:44:46.440]  this is why places like dc have the highest gun crime because they get guns
[2:44:46.440 --> 2:44:49.240]  illegally anyway let me ask you this why do you think
[2:44:49.240 --> 2:44:52.600]  because the statistics show this that the gun culture not just here but
[2:44:52.600 --> 2:44:57.400]  worldwide is so popular and people don't believe the propaganda anymore
[2:44:57.400 --> 2:45:01.240]  and even the left i know are out quietly buying guns the last six seven years
[2:45:01.240 --> 2:45:06.840]  why do you think that's happening i think even the progressives when they
[2:45:06.840 --> 2:45:11.000]  go out there and experience life and experience the real world
[2:45:11.000 --> 2:45:14.600]  they will have the state step on them in some way or another
[2:45:14.600 --> 2:45:20.600]  and maybe even deep down inside on a dinosaur level their dinosaur brain
[2:45:20.600 --> 2:45:24.760]  tells them to protect themselves because at some point unless you're a total
[2:45:24.760 --> 2:45:28.280]  vegetable you'll realize that nobody's going to protect you
[2:45:28.280 --> 2:45:32.760]  you have to protect yourself and i don't care how they sell it or how they wrap
[2:45:32.760 --> 2:45:37.000]  it up the at the end of the day even the best most
[2:45:37.000 --> 2:45:40.840]  well-run most funded government will not protect you
[2:45:40.840 --> 2:45:44.120]  fast enough yeah where was the government where were the cops to protect
[2:45:44.120 --> 2:45:47.160]  these news reporters and the message is it's not their job
[2:45:47.160 --> 2:45:51.000]  they can't do it it's impossible yeah there's been cases of
[2:45:51.000 --> 2:45:55.240]  fires burning and people screaming and the cops standing around
[2:45:55.240 --> 2:45:59.400]  waiting for orders not knowing what to do and while meanwhile you're funding
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:03.160]  them with your tax dollars for protection and your family burns alive
[2:46:03.160 --> 2:46:06.680]  or is getting murdered in your house and that's because the cops are told you
[2:46:06.680 --> 2:46:09.640]  only do when you stuff when you're ordered or you'll be fired
[2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:13.480]  in the past the cops would just go in but now it's so compartmentalized they
[2:46:13.480 --> 2:46:16.440]  wait and follow their orders like when there's a mass shooting the cops would
[2:46:16.440 --> 2:46:19.880]  sit around for hours oh my god in some cases depending on
[2:46:19.880 --> 2:46:23.720]  the jurisdiction because it's their orders so where where where's all this
[2:46:23.720 --> 2:46:26.280]  money going to where's all our tax dollars going to
[2:46:26.280 --> 2:46:30.360]  you know the state i think what's happened now is the state is obsessed
[2:46:30.360 --> 2:46:34.680]  with preventing events from occurring they it's all about control so they
[2:46:34.680 --> 2:46:37.560]  want to create the illusion of preventative measures
[2:46:37.560 --> 2:46:40.920]  which is impossible because people will go crazy
[2:46:40.920 --> 2:46:43.960]  there are bad people in the world and they will do bad things
[2:46:43.960 --> 2:46:47.960]  well you cannot prevent that well sure there's discussions about banning
[2:46:47.960 --> 2:46:51.160]  tubing in texas they've actually discussed it because so many hundreds of
[2:46:51.160 --> 2:46:53.800]  ankles get broken well big deal i know going over
[2:46:53.800 --> 2:46:57.080]  waterfalls in an inner tube i could break my ankle i know my kids could get
[2:46:57.080 --> 2:47:01.080]  hurt that's part of life on this planet i mean you don't get stronger unless you
[2:47:01.080 --> 2:47:03.560]  go through stuff like that i don't send them over white
[2:47:03.560 --> 2:47:07.800]  rapids but i mean you know the i'll go to the beach
[2:47:07.800 --> 2:47:11.480]  and people say there could be jellyfish out there don't let your kids go in
[2:47:11.480 --> 2:47:14.600]  and there'll be like hundreds of kids playing and i go well i know it's not
[2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:18.280]  perfectly safe but it's this weird culture like i was going down to the
[2:47:18.280 --> 2:47:22.440]  hiking bike trail of my kids about a month ago and it had been
[2:47:22.440 --> 2:47:24.920]  flooding like a week before it's totally safe now
[2:47:24.920 --> 2:47:28.120]  wasn't even going fast got down there there were people swimming or anything
[2:47:28.120 --> 2:47:31.160]  some rainstorms were blowing over i'd looked on my phone knew they were
[2:47:31.160 --> 2:47:34.760]  blowing over we're going to be gone it was raining and this guy on a mountain
[2:47:34.760 --> 2:47:38.840]  bike goes hey you going down there with those kids it's flooding it's not safe
[2:47:38.840 --> 2:47:42.120]  storms are coming and i didn't even say anything i didn't
[2:47:42.120 --> 2:47:45.480]  say hey i looked on my phone beforehand it's safe
[2:47:45.480 --> 2:47:48.200]  hey it's about to get sunny which it did five minutes later
[2:47:48.200 --> 2:47:52.680]  i mean the radar tells the truth i just ignored the guy i didn't even say hey
[2:47:52.680 --> 2:47:56.520]  mind your business but i mean it's a nanny state it's sick though what do
[2:47:56.520 --> 2:48:01.320]  you make of that well you know we live in a world of
[2:48:01.320 --> 2:48:07.240]  systematic surveillance aerial strikes ground drills
[2:48:07.240 --> 2:48:10.840]  every everything is watched everything is attempted to be controlled
[2:48:10.840 --> 2:48:17.480]  and the worst the resulting thing that happens is society becomes very
[2:48:17.480 --> 2:48:21.560]  flaccid and jellyfish like so now instead of stagnant
[2:48:21.560 --> 2:48:25.080]  yeah they and soft too because now instead of people
[2:48:25.080 --> 2:48:28.760]  confronting their issues with others they call the police
[2:48:28.760 --> 2:48:32.920]  or they call a service or they you know they go my hamburgers not hot i'm calling
[2:48:32.920 --> 2:48:36.600]  the police yeah and there's this there's this apotheosis of the state and we
[2:48:36.600 --> 2:48:39.880]  think they're god but if the state is god then
[2:48:39.880 --> 2:48:44.120]  it's a sacrificial god and we're the people who are being sacrificed to it
[2:48:44.120 --> 2:48:48.920]  because if you call a higher authority which is the state is now higher power
[2:48:48.920 --> 2:48:52.280]  to most people then you are not an individual anymore you're
[2:48:52.280 --> 2:48:55.880]  relying on somebody else it's like if you're 40 year old man and you still
[2:48:55.880 --> 2:49:00.200]  call your mommy for to make you lunch it i mean it's just that on an
[2:49:00.200 --> 2:49:03.960]  example now they're saying children dreamers are up to age 30
[2:49:03.960 --> 2:49:07.480]  and they're saying that's the new beat you become a man or a woman at 30
[2:49:07.480 --> 2:49:12.440]  and that stemmed from making a child child work illegal right what was the
[2:49:12.440 --> 2:49:17.160]  point of making children under certain age illegal to work
[2:49:17.160 --> 2:49:20.600]  it was to keep them children until they were like 25
[2:49:20.600 --> 2:49:24.520]  i was about to say there were certainly abuses covered in in the jungle and
[2:49:24.520 --> 2:49:27.960]  other publications that the Rockefellers were doing but now they want to ban
[2:49:27.960 --> 2:49:31.640]  your kids taking the trash out or getting eggs out of a chicken coop
[2:49:31.640 --> 2:49:35.080]  and they admit that is so they're a bunch of babbling idiots and aren't
[2:49:35.080 --> 2:49:37.640]  confident when in truth what you did in the old days is you
[2:49:37.640 --> 2:49:40.840]  apprenticed your sons mainly but daughters as well
[2:49:40.840 --> 2:49:44.920]  in to really rough situations you empower them that way my dad
[2:49:44.920 --> 2:49:48.520]  apprenticed in basically everything by the time he was like 16
[2:49:48.520 --> 2:49:51.560]  i mean i was sent to do apprentice stuff i didn't know how important that was and
[2:49:51.560 --> 2:49:55.080]  there's no men left now like it's like women like me we're all the men
[2:49:55.080 --> 2:49:58.280]  men can't they can't build anything they can't fix anything
[2:49:58.280 --> 2:50:02.280]  they have to call somebody for anything that needs to be done
[2:50:02.280 --> 2:50:05.720]  and my father comes from that same generation he grew up in the soviet
[2:50:05.720 --> 2:50:09.400]  union you can't call anybody gotta do everything by yourself
[2:50:09.400 --> 2:50:13.400]  and in a system like that you have to use black markets and now it's like
[2:50:13.400 --> 2:50:17.480]  oh the toilet breaks i have to pay someone because i don't have a license to do
[2:50:17.480 --> 2:50:21.800]  this so it's the and it's a deterioration of everybody
[2:50:21.800 --> 2:50:25.480]  and i mean i'm gonna skip this break as we're low on time and i came in a few
[2:50:25.480 --> 2:50:28.440]  minutes late i apologize for that should have told you guys that absolutely
[2:50:28.440 --> 2:50:31.480]  let's take some calls and we'll do some overdrive into the next hour
[2:50:31.480 --> 2:50:33.880]  i'll be great we have more time to flesh all this out
[2:50:33.880 --> 2:50:37.640]  we have our guests joining us here from toronto canada so i was up in toronto
[2:50:37.640 --> 2:50:41.080]  and i came to austin to give a speech and then you were down here
[2:50:41.080 --> 2:50:44.600]  and i remember first seeing you reporting with paul watson about three years
[2:50:44.600 --> 2:50:47.480]  ago in kopenhagen and bilderberg and i've seen some of you guys
[2:50:47.480 --> 2:50:50.840]  joint work so it's good to have you here joining us thank you let's go ahead and
[2:50:50.840 --> 2:50:55.000]  talk to dug uh in minnesota thank you for holding dug you're a real trooper go
[2:50:55.000 --> 2:50:58.040]  ahead hey how are you guys doing today good
[2:50:58.040 --> 2:51:01.880]  brother say you know it's a terrible thing
[2:51:01.880 --> 2:51:06.360]  what happened you know at that news station but it's what's even a
[2:51:06.360 --> 2:51:11.240]  worse thing is all the cemeteries that we filled with our soldiers and our
[2:51:11.240 --> 2:51:17.640]  police to fought for the freedoms and the rights of people in this country
[2:51:17.640 --> 2:51:21.240]  and it appears there's a lot of people are forgetting about that they're
[2:51:21.240 --> 2:51:26.200]  forgetting how we got to this point and they're so willing to just give it up
[2:51:26.200 --> 2:51:31.480]  and throw it away you know and i'm i'm partaking the guns away but not from
[2:51:31.480 --> 2:51:35.640]  the people i'm partaking it away from al-qaeda isis
[2:51:35.640 --> 2:51:42.120]  just so just so whatever they want to call it today and they're funding the
[2:51:42.120 --> 2:51:45.800]  people that they're letting in the country now we're supposed to
[2:51:45.800 --> 2:51:49.880]  give our guns up while they're giving guns to people and having them come in
[2:51:49.880 --> 2:51:54.920]  the country you know i i looked at it as
[2:51:54.920 --> 2:51:58.600]  that's the military that obama was talking about
[2:51:58.600 --> 2:52:01.960]  sure he talks about a domestic security force just as big
[2:52:01.960 --> 2:52:06.360]  just as strong as our military and that is his akern youth brigades
[2:52:06.360 --> 2:52:12.520]  classic you know musolini style garbage by the way now they're reporting that
[2:52:12.520 --> 2:52:18.120]  vester had vester flanagan had a manifesto so we're going to go into
[2:52:18.120 --> 2:52:21.880]  overdrive the next hour continue your calls and break some of that down but
[2:52:21.880 --> 2:52:25.400]  this thing is looking more and more bizarre and this guy
[2:52:25.400 --> 2:52:30.200]  looks like one of the fruitiest nutballs i mean all these mass shooters
[2:52:30.200 --> 2:52:32.280]  that have weird questionable government connections
[2:52:32.280 --> 2:52:36.760]  look like they come from mars but this guy looks like a muppet or something
[2:52:36.760 --> 2:52:39.960]  i mean does anyone in their mind he used to be handsome
[2:52:39.960 --> 2:52:43.000]  and a pretty good reporter we found some of his old reports
[2:52:43.000 --> 2:52:46.680]  now he looks like he's been on something i think this guy was in
[2:52:46.680 --> 2:52:50.840]  somebody's clutches i'm not sure of that he just looks like
[2:52:50.840 --> 2:52:53.880]  he's been in a mental ward for five years on thorazine
[2:52:53.880 --> 2:52:58.360]  something is wrong with this guy i bet money he was on some type of psychotropic
[2:52:58.360 --> 2:53:01.560]  what do you guess i'm like i'll take another direction
[2:53:01.560 --> 2:53:04.920]  so let's say he's not drugged let's say he's not crazy i've never seen him
[2:53:04.920 --> 2:53:08.840]  though they are drugged but let's say they're not let's um
[2:53:08.840 --> 2:53:13.560]  this could be a direct result of how american people especially the left
[2:53:13.560 --> 2:53:18.200]  progressives they have chosen to internalize racism
[2:53:18.200 --> 2:53:21.720]  instead of actually putting things out on the table and being
[2:53:21.720 --> 2:53:25.080]  straightforward about it and this goes back to what malcolm x would say
[2:53:25.080 --> 2:53:29.400]  and if you look at one of the speeches he did he talked about how
[2:53:29.400 --> 2:53:32.760]  there's this consensus that the south is racist
[2:53:32.760 --> 2:53:38.040]  and the north is anti-racist guess which people moved out of their
[2:53:38.040 --> 2:53:41.400]  neighborhoods when the blacks came into their neighborhoods
[2:53:41.400 --> 2:53:45.160]  the democrat the democrat northerners moved out of their neighborhoods
[2:53:45.160 --> 2:53:48.680]  immediately as soon as black populations came in the southerners
[2:53:48.680 --> 2:53:52.600]  lived alongside with their black neighbors and vetted their frustrations
[2:53:52.600 --> 2:53:57.400]  and found a way to co-live and get along so when you well yeah that's the
[2:53:57.400 --> 2:53:59.720]  cultures are pretty much the same in the south
[2:53:59.720 --> 2:54:03.240]  yeah but it shows that the way to deal with
[2:54:03.240 --> 2:54:09.000]  racist mentality is to have it out in the open not internalize it and
[2:54:09.000 --> 2:54:12.680]  censor people because like today we have nothing on the book
[2:54:12.680 --> 2:54:16.600]  burners we have nothing on the third right we have nothing on us on the
[2:54:16.600 --> 2:54:21.160]  socialist censorship oh the left now is hardcore censor yeah it's the
[2:54:21.160 --> 2:54:25.320]  in america today we have nothing in the book burners we are just as bad
[2:54:25.320 --> 2:54:29.320]  maybe to a different extreme and the canadiens are even worse
[2:54:29.320 --> 2:54:32.600]  oh the canadiens you can't even have a legitimate conversation with the
[2:54:32.600 --> 2:54:35.320]  canadian person they're scared to voice any opinion
[2:54:35.320 --> 2:54:39.240]  to such an extent we don't have any we said they'd ban old glory next now
[2:54:39.240 --> 2:54:43.240]  schools are banning all flags see then soon all
[2:54:43.240 --> 2:54:46.680]  images are evil yeah i know a man who lost his entire
[2:54:46.680 --> 2:54:52.200]  career and has been totally discredited and slandered because he used the term
[2:54:52.200 --> 2:54:57.240]  house negro uh describing a situation where it actually happened and we had
[2:54:57.240 --> 2:55:02.040]  synthia mckinney the first black female congresswoman from georgia
[2:55:02.040 --> 2:55:05.160]  support this man and she's a black woman she said yes
[2:55:05.160 --> 2:55:08.840]  what he said was true and that the canadian government
[2:55:08.840 --> 2:55:14.120]  and specific schools censored him and sued him and used two million dollars
[2:55:14.120 --> 2:55:19.080]  of student money to get this guy out well that's what it is is they want to
[2:55:19.080 --> 2:55:22.200]  be able to arrest people or ruin them for their speech
[2:55:22.200 --> 2:55:25.800]  this is very very dangerous totalitarianism again a lot of stations
[2:55:25.800 --> 2:55:28.760]  leave us when we start the next hour info wars dot com
[2:55:28.760 --> 2:55:33.720]  forward slash show to find the free feeds this is going to be pushed because it
[2:55:33.720 --> 2:55:36.840]  is dramatic i mean it deserves me a big story because the footage is so
[2:55:36.840 --> 2:55:40.520]  horrific we played some of it earlier uh i don't
[2:55:40.520 --> 2:55:44.440]  want to continue to play it anymore the wall there you go is on info wars dot
[2:55:44.440 --> 2:55:47.960]  com and prison planet dot com but understand
[2:55:47.960 --> 2:55:51.400]  just because we see this makes it personable and makes it personal and
[2:55:51.400 --> 2:55:55.160]  makes it hurt imagine all the innocent people
[2:55:55.160 --> 2:55:58.600]  being killed by al-qaeda and other globalist forces being funded by our
[2:55:58.600 --> 2:56:02.440]  government or what's happening in ukraine started by our government again
[2:56:02.440 --> 2:56:05.720]  you say what you want about the russians but our government started it you look
[2:56:05.720 --> 2:56:09.880]  at all this this is a very very very dangerous
[2:56:09.880 --> 2:56:12.920]  time and this whole thing is becoming a
[2:56:12.920 --> 2:56:15.960]  distraction from the huge crimes that are taking place
[2:56:15.960 --> 2:56:19.640]  and alex we should also acknowledge the black and black crime that has been
[2:56:19.640 --> 2:56:23.560]  engineered by the government between 75 and 90 percent of all
[2:56:23.560 --> 2:56:27.480]  crime against blacks is by other blacks and they've been engineered to turn in
[2:56:27.480 --> 2:56:30.520]  each other and to have these gangs and the wars and
[2:56:30.520 --> 2:56:34.840]  even the hip hop hip hop culture has become um
[2:56:34.840 --> 2:56:38.520]  has been engineered to turn on itself and you can listen to artists like
[2:56:38.520 --> 2:56:41.240]  Kendrick Lamar who's like one of the only people who
[2:56:41.240 --> 2:56:45.320]  acknowledges this issue like why are we why are we can't criticize anybody
[2:56:45.320 --> 2:56:49.240]  until we stop killing ourselves and this is again a direct result of
[2:56:49.240 --> 2:56:52.360]  state intervention in their neighborhoods and the way people
[2:56:52.360 --> 2:56:59.400]  have been programmed to hate each other absolutely let's go to another caller
[2:56:59.400 --> 2:57:03.480]  here thanks for holding matt matt in washington you're on the air thanks for
[2:57:03.480 --> 2:57:08.600]  holding hello alex yes or go ahead well i just
[2:57:08.600 --> 2:57:12.600]  wanted to comment on bill and hillary for a second is that okay sir i'm not

[2:57:15.240 --> 2:57:18.840]  about whatever you want okay so when hillary and obama
[2:57:18.840 --> 2:57:22.280]  disappeared on their little meeting and they ditched the press
[2:57:22.280 --> 2:57:25.240]  do you think that hillary was given a deal to like back out and she'd be
[2:57:25.240 --> 2:57:29.160]  promised the election in 2016 i don't know what happened inside that
[2:57:29.160 --> 2:57:32.200]  bill neberg meeting i just know they were there it was a huge story we knew
[2:57:32.200 --> 2:57:35.400]  they were there the secret service was there they aimed guns at us
[2:57:35.400 --> 2:57:40.600]  and no dinosaur media would come out the the epoch times the fall on gong
[2:57:40.600 --> 2:57:45.160]  publication came out and covered it uh drudge linked to it
[2:57:45.160 --> 2:57:50.840]  that was it no coverage of the huge event of them disappearing for a day
[2:57:50.840 --> 2:57:55.160]  in a secret meeting and the media was so controlled when we called them
[2:57:55.160 --> 2:57:59.000]  they knew they were there but they knew not to cover it
[2:57:59.000 --> 2:58:03.240]  so that's amazing but how the worm has turned i saw a mainstream news article
[2:58:03.240 --> 2:58:07.320]  i meant to cover it last week i forget where it was but
[2:58:07.320 --> 2:58:12.440]  it was i think it was newsweek yeah it was newsweek the daily beast
[2:58:12.440 --> 2:58:18.120]  saying that a leader had gone to their own bill deberg type meeting
[2:58:18.120 --> 2:58:21.640]  and so now that term is out in the open now it's safe for them to report on it
[2:58:21.640 --> 2:58:25.320]  stay there mad i'm back in 70 seconds i'm gonna have you finish up the neil

[3:00:22.280 --> 3:00:27.800]  uh young women old women young men old men middle age whatever they tell you
[3:00:27.800 --> 3:00:31.320]  you're supposed to be a kid now till you're 30 if you're a man
[3:00:31.320 --> 3:00:34.760]  you're a woman you got to be a successful business woman by 15
[3:00:34.760 --> 3:00:37.240]  they want to arrest the development of men
[3:00:37.240 --> 3:00:41.080]  into that culture not to empower women but to get ready to bring down
[3:00:41.080 --> 3:00:44.840]  the entire society and this is all admitted by the globalists
[3:00:44.840 --> 3:00:48.360]  we're going to do 30 minutes of overdrive in the next few weeks we're
[3:00:48.360 --> 3:00:53.080]  going to start doing the whole fourth hour live every day
[3:00:53.080 --> 3:00:57.240]  and reactivating all the affiliates they're already coming back on board
[3:00:57.240 --> 3:01:00.520]  that's why at least once a week i'm doing the whole fourth hour live
[3:01:00.520 --> 3:01:05.160]  i'll be in here most days for the fourth hour but i'll always have a round table
[3:01:05.160 --> 3:01:09.080]  of guest and my other reporters for us so we're bringing
[3:01:09.080 --> 3:01:13.720]  the fourth hour back uh let's go back to matt
[3:01:13.720 --> 3:01:18.520]  in washington you got to make one point what was your other point matt
[3:01:18.520 --> 3:01:22.200]  well uh mike fits Simmons up here in spokane just worships Ozzie Knezovich i
[3:01:22.200 --> 3:01:24.840]  call this show and he basically said oh it's
[3:01:24.840 --> 3:01:27.640]  much to do about nothing it's a big deal and
[3:01:27.640 --> 3:01:33.240]  you know i told him uh i told him it is a big deal he basically hung up on me
[3:01:33.240 --> 3:01:36.200]  but they just worship that guy another point i wanted to make was that if
[3:01:36.200 --> 3:01:39.400]  trump keeps going let's say he's elected president
[3:01:39.400 --> 3:01:43.080]  how is he going to get everything done the government is not a corporation he
[3:01:43.080 --> 3:01:46.200]  can't just go in there and start start signing executive orders
[3:01:46.200 --> 3:01:49.080]  and if he does are people going to accept it because it's trump and it's the
[3:01:49.080 --> 3:01:53.960]  right thing to do uh thirdly music i love your
[3:01:53.960 --> 3:01:57.960]  diversity in music and i wanted you i was just kind of curious on how you came
[3:01:57.960 --> 3:02:01.160]  to like so many different styles of music because i'm the same way but i'm a
[3:02:01.160 --> 3:02:04.440]  musician so i just listened to whatever i hear and it
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:07.720]  doesn't matter whether i'm listening to indian music or middle eastern music or
[3:02:07.720 --> 3:02:14.040]  african music or mexican music or south american music or uh classical rock and
[3:02:14.040 --> 3:02:18.280]  roll uh hard rock uh old-fashioned country
[3:02:18.280 --> 3:02:25.160]  only thing i don't like is modern country and modern hip hop pop crap
[3:02:25.160 --> 3:02:28.360]  i mean a lot of it's got a catchy tune or whatever but it's just
[3:02:28.360 --> 3:02:31.880]  it's just it's just modern stuff it's not because i'm old
[3:02:31.880 --> 3:02:35.320]  i hear a lot of new stuff the young people are doing it's not establishment
[3:02:35.320 --> 3:02:39.000]  and i really love it but the stuff put out purposely
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:43.560]  by the music industry just does not really ever float my boat i appreciate
[3:02:43.560 --> 3:02:46.920]  your call uh your take on music as a weapon
[3:02:46.920 --> 3:02:51.880]  uh well there's just i think a lot of these artists start out
[3:02:51.880 --> 3:02:55.720]  with pure with pure intentions and real spirit and real talent
[3:02:55.720 --> 3:03:00.120]  and then they make it and they see also first of all they have the influences
[3:03:00.120 --> 3:03:04.200]  by the companies after they make it second of all they have the influence by
[3:03:04.200 --> 3:03:08.680]  the herd of the millions of viewers online and the people that listen to them
[3:03:08.680 --> 3:03:13.720]  who have been so intellectually destroyed that all they want to hear is
[3:03:13.720 --> 3:03:19.880]  over sexualized songs with uh undertones of aggressive an aggressive
[3:03:19.880 --> 3:03:23.240]  undertone so i think it's very adolescent it's for
[3:03:23.240 --> 3:03:27.080]  it's for little boys that actually haven't and i've watched plenty of
[3:03:27.080 --> 3:03:31.560]  interviews with artists who have said that they said well i put out
[3:03:31.560 --> 3:03:35.880]  a music video with uh with a naughty word in the title
[3:03:35.880 --> 3:03:40.120]  and i get 15 million views and i put out a piece of music that
[3:03:40.120 --> 3:03:46.120]  has depth to it and i get 500 000 so right now you know um
[3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:50.840]  life is imitating art art is in driving life right now and we need to reverse
[3:03:50.840 --> 3:03:54.680]  that i think art and music is a very powerful tool and we need
[3:03:54.680 --> 3:03:58.840]  sure good art and music to kind of remodel the way that we're thinking
[3:03:58.840 --> 3:04:02.280]  that's a great point because they had a really good front line like a decade ago
[3:04:02.280 --> 3:04:06.280]  about the feedback loop and they studied it with experts and it wasn't that
[3:04:06.280 --> 3:04:10.360]  mtv was following what people wanted they were force feeding it
[3:04:10.360 --> 3:04:14.520]  yeah control the agenda and that's kind of my tagline i i have a whole video
[3:04:14.520 --> 3:04:18.520]  dedicated to saying let's escape the feedback loop let's just break away
[3:04:18.520 --> 3:04:22.040]  and that goes back to the caller's comments about trump we're not going to
[3:04:22.040 --> 3:04:25.000]  have a better world with trump as president he's still president he's still
[3:04:25.000 --> 3:04:29.080]  controlled by the same powers doesn't matter but man is he slick i watch this
[3:04:29.080 --> 3:04:32.040]  two minute i do like watching him i watch his response to the
[3:04:32.040 --> 3:04:36.120]  univision reporter and just the way he handled that reporter and kept making
[3:04:36.120 --> 3:04:40.120]  him look stupid i mean trump is something else he does open eyes because
[3:04:40.120 --> 3:04:43.720]  he's been in there he's bribed the politicians he's seen the favor
[3:04:43.720 --> 3:04:47.240]  well see he could get in trouble for that so he owns it he's really smart we'll

[3:07:37.800 --> 3:07:49.400]  800-686-2237 800-686-2237 that's 800-686-2237
[3:07:49.400 --> 3:07:53.000]  the genesis communications radio network proudly presents
[3:07:53.000 --> 3:08:12.840]  the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[3:08:12.840 --> 3:08:18.840]  julia toronski is our guest brave the world dot com is her website and she is i
[3:08:18.840 --> 3:08:23.160]  guess would you call yourself an anarchist a libertarian
[3:08:23.160 --> 3:08:27.640]  yes and when people ask me what i do i generally say something like my only
[3:08:27.640 --> 3:08:32.440]  goal is to disenfranchise people from their assumed power structures so
[3:08:32.440 --> 3:08:37.000]  you're an individualist anarchist what is that that means i don't believe in
[3:08:37.000 --> 3:08:41.560]  any centralized authority that works by force
[3:08:41.560 --> 3:08:45.320]  ruling us that doesn't mean you can't have organization
[3:08:45.320 --> 3:08:51.160]  or some sort of cooperation that just means that if that exists you can leave
[3:08:51.160 --> 3:08:55.160]  and you can opt out and nobody will hunt you down make you pay your taxes or
[3:08:55.160 --> 3:08:59.000]  you know absolutely jail and there's a conspiracy by the big foundations to
[3:08:59.000 --> 3:09:04.280]  have communists go out and just scum devil worshipers you name it
[3:09:04.280 --> 3:09:08.120]  literally and wear black and then they say they're anarchists but then they
[3:09:08.120 --> 3:09:12.040]  have communist tattoos and they just say they're anarchists
[3:09:12.040 --> 3:09:15.480]  because they don't want to be honest about their communism that's the opposite
[3:09:15.480 --> 3:09:20.360]  of anarchy yeah tight sue was an anarchist leotolstra was an anarchist
[3:09:20.360 --> 3:09:26.040]  and some belgarie was an anarchist these you know 1800 philosophers there's a
[3:09:26.040 --> 3:09:29.560]  whole rich body of work and they got taken over by
[3:09:29.560 --> 3:09:33.800]  the communist yeah it's all got compounded and
[3:09:33.800 --> 3:09:37.560]  actually there's strands and strands of thought just like any philosophy so
[3:09:37.560 --> 3:09:41.720]  it's a neat it's like anything today it's a word that triggers
[3:09:41.720 --> 3:09:47.960]  but all that anarchy means is the absence of government and
[3:09:47.960 --> 3:09:51.400]  the what so they have hammer and sickle flags saying we're anarchists that
[3:09:51.400 --> 3:09:55.400]  shows how dumb these kids are it's insane we they're reconstructing
[3:09:55.400 --> 3:09:59.800]  language right that's what they do and when you capture language in society
[3:09:59.800 --> 3:10:03.640]  you capture the people and they really are political
[3:10:03.640 --> 3:10:09.000]  correctness is a war on language mm-hmm it really is i had an idea i ran by
[3:10:09.000 --> 3:10:13.160]  you know everyone's saying oh keep the uh keep the mexican so put the border
[3:10:13.160 --> 3:10:17.480]  put the put the fences up what about putting a giant fence around
[3:10:17.480 --> 3:10:22.280]  california and filming them like self cannibalizing uh
[3:10:22.280 --> 3:10:26.120]  they're with their pc thoughts and their pc culture
[3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:29.640]  and they get a giant running man meets a reality
[3:10:29.640 --> 3:10:33.320]  tv show and wall the californians and kill each other
[3:10:33.320 --> 3:10:36.760]  wall them in we don't want them in you we're here they're all moving to austin
[3:10:36.760 --> 3:10:40.200]  because of the regulations happening california and then they want to put
[3:10:40.200 --> 3:10:43.720]  the same regulations here and they poison they want public pooping all of the
[3:10:43.720 --> 3:10:47.800]  stuff keep keep the californians and i think that
[3:10:47.800 --> 3:10:50.680]  would solve more problems than keeping the mexicans i think it should be the new
[3:10:50.680 --> 3:10:54.760]  california flag is a homeless guy crapping i think so i'm sorry like i
[3:10:54.760 --> 3:10:57.880]  have seen like i've seen this i was there for only a month and i
[3:10:57.880 --> 3:11:02.200]  witnessed that it's terrible and it's again the directors of the government's
[3:11:02.200 --> 3:11:06.120]  intervention why why being hateful i'm discriminatory i'm white so i can't
[3:11:06.120 --> 3:11:09.160]  help as part of the culture i am white privileged you know like
[3:11:09.160 --> 3:11:13.320]  how my family died in communist russia but i have privilege
[3:11:13.320 --> 3:11:17.080]  well you're responsible for slavery of course you know that was one thing about
[3:11:17.080 --> 3:11:20.600]  Ferguson and st louis a bunch of eastern european immigrants
[3:11:20.600 --> 3:11:23.640]  got killed because they're poor they're moving into poorer areas
[3:11:23.640 --> 3:11:27.240]  and racist black groups beat them to death with a hammer shoot them
[3:11:27.240 --> 3:11:30.760]  and they'll say well they're white as if eastern europeans had anything to do with
[3:11:30.760 --> 3:11:34.440]  africa transatlantic slavery it's just so stupid
[3:11:34.440 --> 3:11:39.720]  it's totally insane it's totally insane um and again it goes back to no one you
[3:11:39.720 --> 3:11:43.320]  know it's it's another contradiction of the progressive mind
[3:11:43.320 --> 3:11:48.040]  because of if you're white you're responsible for your people's history
[3:11:48.040 --> 3:11:51.640]  but you're not responsible for yourself as an individual so you can't
[3:11:51.640 --> 3:11:56.040]  have a gun i mean it doesn't make any for airline pilots that could crash the
[3:11:56.040 --> 3:11:59.080]  whole plane and and kill tens of thousands right
[3:11:59.080 --> 3:12:02.760]  they can't have a gun in the cockpit or or cars i mean
[3:12:02.760 --> 3:12:10.120]  cars are like this libertarian utopian success of human intellect
[3:12:10.120 --> 3:12:14.120]  intellect and individualism people generally drive cars safely
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:18.840]  you're you're wielding a machine of tons of force that could kill anybody if you
[3:12:18.840 --> 3:12:23.240]  choose to but we let people get a license over the weekend and drive a car
[3:12:23.240 --> 3:12:27.480]  i mean that's insane we should ban the cars you can kill a whole family and
[3:12:27.480 --> 3:12:30.760]  that's where they're going that's where they're going with turning it all into
[3:12:30.760 --> 3:12:33.960]  a prison and people ask well how is the insurance company
[3:12:33.960 --> 3:12:37.000]  is going to make money when it's driverless cars the long phase out
[3:12:37.000 --> 3:12:40.280]  they're going to double and triple charge people that don't drive driverless
[3:12:40.280 --> 3:12:43.560]  cars they're going to phase in the driverless cars with Mercedes
[3:12:43.560 --> 3:12:46.600]  Audi and others that have them where they automatically start slowing down
[3:12:46.600 --> 3:12:49.960]  you think you're going to hit somebody and sure that's probably good in and of
[3:12:49.960 --> 3:12:54.520]  itself except it's ai it's taking control just like
[3:12:54.520 --> 3:12:58.440]  calculators in 30 years from texas instruments have
[3:12:58.440 --> 3:13:01.320]  made us going from being good with arithmetic on our heads
[3:13:01.320 --> 3:13:05.640]  to not even knowing how to do it yeah or spell checkers this stuff has a
[3:13:05.640 --> 3:13:10.520]  has a side effect of dumbing us down we should make the conscious decision
[3:13:10.520 --> 3:13:15.240]  to not go in this direction and develop technological applications
[3:13:15.240 --> 3:13:20.040]  and use vet empowers humanity there should at least be a debate about it
[3:13:20.040 --> 3:13:22.600]  and there's a lot of things that do do that and again
[3:13:22.600 --> 3:13:26.920]  being an individualist anarchist goes back to taking responsibility so
[3:13:26.920 --> 3:13:31.960]  as a woman i own a gun because that is a purple penguin
[3:13:31.960 --> 3:13:36.040]  the word woman might hurt somebody's feelings oh yeah uh soon natural birth
[3:13:36.040 --> 3:13:40.360]  will be illegal because transgender people can't give natural birth and by the
[3:13:40.360 --> 3:13:42.760]  way don't joke they're actually talking about that now now
[3:13:42.760 --> 3:13:47.240]  say i'm a purple i'm not joking say i'm a purple purple penguin who owns a gun
[3:13:47.240 --> 3:13:51.160]  and i think old women should own guns oh i'm sorry all purple penguins should
[3:13:51.160 --> 3:13:53.960]  own guns and i think there's a clip that you
[3:13:53.960 --> 3:13:57.960]  guys can show and i really summarize why quite well
[3:13:57.960 --> 3:14:01.720]  let's go to this purple penguin clip this is a purple penguin with a gun
[3:14:01.720 --> 3:14:04.920]  women's rights and gun rights are congruent
[3:14:04.920 --> 3:14:08.520]  most females are physiologically smaller than most males
[3:14:08.520 --> 3:14:12.440]  this puts women at a great disadvantage in a life-threatening situation
[3:14:12.440 --> 3:14:17.720]  against a man a gun is an equalizer without it the quality between sexes
[3:14:17.720 --> 3:14:22.040]  is a joke but wait a minute to even say that women on average aren't as strong
[3:14:22.040 --> 3:14:26.200]  as men is sexist and is part of the hierarchy of male
[3:14:26.200 --> 3:14:29.320]  oppression that you're defending and helping i've never heard
[3:14:29.320 --> 3:14:33.000]  such thought crime it's crazy are you saying i can't have a baby
[3:14:33.000 --> 3:14:36.440]  because you're claiming i'm not as equal to you
[3:14:36.440 --> 3:14:41.320]  in a reproductive way that's sexist as well i'm a purple penguin i can lay eggs
[3:14:41.320 --> 3:14:45.080]  i think i think the olympics shouldn't be broken up into sexes anymore we
[3:14:45.080 --> 3:14:49.320]  should all have the olympics as one gender and if women can't keep up and
[3:14:49.320 --> 3:14:53.000]  compete with the men um then that's sexist and they should
[3:14:53.000 --> 3:14:55.560]  be executed well actually you should give the men
[3:14:55.560 --> 3:14:59.320]  hormones to turn them into women oh yeah well we're already doing that all
[3:14:59.320 --> 3:15:02.360]  that all the estrogen from the birth control pill you're drinking that every
[3:15:02.360 --> 3:15:06.600]  day no big deal so it's not worth the social engineering though let's just
[3:15:06.600 --> 3:15:11.320]  worship rachel maddo oh god is she even a woman
[3:15:11.320 --> 3:15:15.640]  i'm gonna be honest i'm actually gay and i'm i'm dating a man named rachel
[3:15:15.640 --> 3:15:20.440]  maddo this is never gonna end this
[3:15:20.440 --> 3:15:23.640]  oh my god they're gonna take that out of context and loop it
[3:15:23.640 --> 3:15:28.040]  no seriously i have a picture it's true
[3:15:28.040 --> 3:15:33.400]  well i'm dating rachel maddo she's a man and if they attack that on there give
[3:15:33.400 --> 3:15:37.720]  me a break it's humor well she's a public figure she

[3:16:46.600 --> 3:16:49.720]  you're continually saying that anything never happens and before you say i
[3:16:49.720 --> 3:16:54.520]  want to stop it that's just the easy way out
[3:16:54.520 --> 3:16:59.320]  are you a joke caller trying to make me look good or are you serious
[3:16:59.320 --> 3:17:05.400]  i'm serious well we never said let me talk you made some statements just

[3:17:09.320 --> 3:17:14.280]  you said that i was saying jade helm was going to be a takeover
[3:17:14.280 --> 3:17:17.480]  or you imply that i never said that that's a construct of
[3:17:17.480 --> 3:17:23.320]  my boyfriend mr maddow you expand upon that with a bunch of other statements
[3:17:23.320 --> 3:17:27.000]  about where's the FEMA camps since i first started exposing emergency
[3:17:27.000 --> 3:17:30.200]  centers in the mid 90s when we were
[3:17:30.200 --> 3:17:34.360]  confirmed it through classified sources about the reeducation camps
[3:17:34.360 --> 3:17:38.520]  under the different programs like the civilian inmate labor camp program that
[3:17:38.520 --> 3:17:43.960]  was declassified in 99 now they have released the army
[3:17:43.960 --> 3:17:48.680]  manuals for the emergency centers establishment system
[3:17:48.680 --> 3:17:52.280]  where it admits the plans under emergency to round up political
[3:17:52.280 --> 3:17:55.000]  dissidents and put us basically in forced labor camps
[3:17:55.000 --> 3:17:58.680]  you can read that at army dot mill we wrote articles about it linked
[3:17:58.680 --> 3:18:02.120]  we're trying to fight them getting the guns they've taken the guns everywhere
[3:18:02.120 --> 3:18:06.520]  else in the world but a handful of nations they admit they want our guns
[3:18:06.520 --> 3:18:10.680]  they're talking about taking the guns away from social security recipients now
[3:18:10.680 --> 3:18:14.840]  that's mainstream news the borders are wide open outside of law they're
[3:18:14.840 --> 3:18:18.600]  shutting off power plants outside of law they're signing us on the trillions
[3:18:18.600 --> 3:18:22.360]  and derivatives outside of law they're delivering armored vehicles the local
[3:18:22.360 --> 3:18:25.080]  department saying it's for the veterans and gun owners
[3:18:25.080 --> 3:18:29.240]  and i mean look we're we've still made it the enemy
[3:18:29.240 --> 3:18:32.760]  95 percent they're kind of still winning in a few places
[3:18:32.760 --> 3:18:35.960]  but we're in a death battle and they've done mass
[3:18:35.960 --> 3:18:39.960]  confiscation illegal confiscation of guns in canada as well
[3:18:39.960 --> 3:18:44.600]  absolutely but this guy calls in and says nothing's happening
[3:18:44.600 --> 3:18:50.360]  and laughs with in a satisfied way like i've been proven wrong i mean it's like
[3:18:50.360 --> 3:18:53.160]  declaring that mark twain was dead when he wasn't
[3:18:53.160 --> 3:18:56.680]  i mean you're a joke bill i mean are you for real
[3:18:56.680 --> 3:19:01.720]  are you for real who can deny we're descending into tyranny
[3:19:01.720 --> 3:19:05.400]  i think that's tyranny yeah alex is everywhere is tyranny look behind you
[3:19:05.400 --> 3:19:08.840]  is tyranny again FEMA camps have you where

[3:19:23.000 --> 3:19:26.040]  read mainstream news articles that came out a month after
[3:19:26.040 --> 3:19:32.520]  confirming our report we broke the secret documents from the fbi state police
[3:19:32.520 --> 3:19:37.960]  federal marshals uh seven years ago about the plan to put
[3:19:37.960 --> 3:19:41.720]  uh in and demonize and go after patriots and people still say that's
[3:19:41.720 --> 3:19:45.240]  fake i mean the truth is we're not lying here
[3:19:45.240 --> 3:19:48.440]  you're hoping people don't go look up these army manuals

[3:19:52.680 --> 3:19:55.160]  manual let me just give you one of the field manuals

[3:20:15.560 --> 3:20:21.800]  february 2010 leaked in 2012 the army first denied it then confirmed it two
[3:20:21.800 --> 3:20:25.320]  weeks later and said that we shouldn't have it that was
[3:20:25.320 --> 3:20:29.800]  covered by major newspapers are you saying that isn't real
[3:20:29.800 --> 3:20:33.400]  every time you have something like that i research it you take a small bit of
[3:20:33.400 --> 3:20:36.920]  truth it's a small bit of information entering into a huge thing and usually
[3:20:36.920 --> 3:20:40.680]  end up being wrong okay that is total bull just like
[3:20:40.680 --> 3:20:42.920]  plan parenthood said none of the videos were real
[3:20:42.920 --> 3:20:46.120]  then they were edited then they weren't selling the body parts oh the
[3:20:46.120 --> 3:20:49.880]  the plan parents didn't sell the baby parts
[3:20:49.880 --> 3:20:53.720]  if you're talking about running for research thing if they do
[3:20:53.720 --> 3:20:57.240]  well let's do this why would they sell body parts
[3:20:57.240 --> 3:21:03.080]  because they make money uh no they don't sell body parts they research
[3:21:03.080 --> 3:21:05.400]  research solution sure and they pay for storage and
[3:21:05.400 --> 3:21:09.720]  transportation sure bill are you a social worker
[3:21:09.720 --> 3:21:12.520]  that's that's irrelevant alex ask my question why would they sell body part
[3:21:12.520 --> 3:21:16.760]  i'm gonna ask you one more time are you a social worker that's irrelevant my
[3:21:16.760 --> 3:21:21.400]  my my so relevant alex okay what is your profession no i i just hear this
[3:21:21.400 --> 3:21:25.320]  you're in your own little power paradigm where you're ruling over everything
[3:21:25.320 --> 3:21:29.560]  and you think you control reality and you think you can run a spin golly on me
[3:21:29.560 --> 3:21:32.920]  and and gas like me and you can't do it you can't do it to our audience
[3:21:32.920 --> 3:21:38.360]  listen i'm gonna ask you again are you you you work for a state government
[3:21:38.360 --> 3:21:41.320]  that's irrelevant alex why it's not irrelevant you know what i like let's
[3:21:41.320 --> 3:21:45.800]  just see if i'm right with my little hunch here tell me right now mr big
[3:21:45.800 --> 3:21:49.160]  brain are you okay or have you ever been a social
[3:21:49.160 --> 3:21:54.680]  worker no so you're not a government worker
[3:21:54.680 --> 3:21:58.840]  no i'm interested what is your profession
[3:21:58.840 --> 3:22:03.960]  why that why is that relevant because i just wonder how stupid you can be
[3:22:03.960 --> 3:22:06.920]  oh that could be every time you say every time you've read something alex on the
[3:22:06.920 --> 3:22:09.640]  air i have gone and researched it and usually it seems that being one small
[3:22:09.640 --> 3:22:14.840]  that's a lie to target new listeners people listening on wbcr
[3:22:14.840 --> 3:22:18.760]  to then think we're not telling the truth no we put up the full manual
[3:22:18.760 --> 3:22:22.040]  that talks about processing people with their social security numbers
[3:22:22.040 --> 3:22:25.720]  and families and i've got footage myself shot
[3:22:25.720 --> 3:22:29.480]  and countless other videos of people screaming i'm an american don't put me in
[3:22:29.480 --> 3:22:33.960]  the camp don't take my guns in videos and the police saying the mrap
[3:22:33.960 --> 3:22:38.360]  tanks are for the american people now is that not true either
[3:22:38.360 --> 3:22:42.360]  are your friends training for size what they do yeah if they're training to take
[3:22:42.360 --> 3:22:47.160]  on veterans and gun owners and and they say the armored vehicles are for us
[3:22:47.160 --> 3:22:53.320]  what does that mean jackass jackass i'll see the conversation's gone a nice
[3:22:53.320 --> 3:22:57.800]  no no you are a stubborn jackass in the bible it talks about people acting like
[3:22:57.800 --> 3:23:00.840]  an ass i think you're giving this guy you are acting like a
[3:23:00.840 --> 3:23:05.240]  ass all right i appreciate your plan i'll quote us toshina komodo who invented
[3:23:05.240 --> 3:23:09.560]  big coin and he said if you don't get it i don't have time for you
[3:23:09.560 --> 3:23:13.800]  that's it well i mean i think that guy was for real
[3:23:13.800 --> 3:23:17.320]  oh of course i mean there's loads of people who feel that way and it's um
[3:23:17.320 --> 3:23:23.240]  it's a defense mechanism and i mean people don't have to uh you know people
[3:23:23.240 --> 3:23:27.240]  no they used to tell me that there was no such thing as the nsa 20 years ago
[3:23:27.240 --> 3:23:30.200]  no such thing as echelon i'd have major whistleblowers on
[3:23:30.200 --> 3:23:33.800]  and people would say that wasn't the former producer of nightline
[3:23:33.800 --> 3:23:37.640]  that wasn't the former nsa officer and you don't have to believe
[3:23:37.640 --> 3:23:41.080]  everything but now it's all out in the open proven right again proven right
[3:23:41.080 --> 3:23:43.800]  again you don't have to believe everything that
[3:23:43.800 --> 3:23:48.280]  anybody says but there must be if you don't understand that there's
[3:23:48.280 --> 3:23:52.040]  something deeply wrong with most things that we are told
[3:23:52.040 --> 3:23:54.920]  then you are living in a fog of your own illusion
[3:23:54.920 --> 3:23:57.880]  okay sure well i mean i don't need to call him names i mean i'm intellectual
[3:23:57.880 --> 3:24:01.480]  enough to come up with terms for it but when somebody acts like a baby and
[3:24:01.480 --> 3:24:05.640]  just puts out this info he is a jackass i still think he's a social worker just
[3:24:05.640 --> 3:24:09.480]  from the way he was speaking oh i'm that's why he didn't answer the question
[3:24:09.480 --> 3:24:12.520]  because you don't want to say yes he'd rather say those are yeah i think he was
[3:24:12.520 --> 3:24:17.320]  lying i think he's a social worker i've just learned the self-satisfied and
[3:24:17.320 --> 3:24:20.120]  they're not all like that some of them are nice but i've run into that i've just
[3:24:20.120 --> 3:24:22.840]  learned the little self-satisfied thing like they're in control they talk
[3:24:22.840 --> 3:24:25.240]  real soft to you like you're a joke it's all kind of
[3:24:25.240 --> 3:24:29.720]  sentient you know whatever buddy you don't control reality and i'll say boy or
[3:24:29.720 --> 3:24:34.280]  girl father or mother husband wife i'll never say purple penguin
[3:24:34.280 --> 3:24:37.800]  yeah well there's there's something deeply wrong and you want to control
[3:24:37.800 --> 3:24:41.080]  everything like cult leaders there's there's a man because they're
[3:24:41.080 --> 3:24:45.400]  building a giant crap hole you people produce
[3:24:45.400 --> 3:24:48.680]  you know what and we're sick of you we don't want to be led by you
[3:24:48.680 --> 3:24:52.120]  we don't like you we don't like your labels go
[3:24:52.120 --> 3:24:57.880]  to hell sorry go ahead when when america's throwing people like ross
[3:24:57.880 --> 3:25:01.880]  olberg in jail for starting a website while and and giving him a
[3:25:01.880 --> 3:25:05.400]  harsher sentence than people who have killed multiple people or raped
[3:25:05.400 --> 3:25:08.520]  multiple people we know that there's an agenda of oppression and
[3:25:08.520 --> 3:25:12.200]  control in america and the government is scared of independent
[3:25:12.200 --> 3:25:14.520]  thoughts look at how canada extradites people that say the
[3:25:14.520 --> 3:25:18.280]  holocaust didn't happen now i may not agree with what they're saying
[3:25:18.280 --> 3:25:21.880]  but the point is these people get put in solitary confinement for decades in
[3:25:21.880 --> 3:25:26.680]  germany aren't zundal and people because someone said
[3:25:26.680 --> 3:25:30.920]  something political that candidate didn't agree with that's a tyranny
[3:25:30.920 --> 3:25:35.080]  yeah and the the interesting thing is israel themselves
[3:25:35.080 --> 3:25:39.080]  denied the holocaust for the first few years after it occurred because they
[3:25:39.080 --> 3:25:43.000]  were embarrassed so there was a whole portion
[3:25:43.000 --> 3:25:46.360]  of jews who just denied that it ever happened
[3:25:46.360 --> 3:25:50.920]  and nobody was prosecuted for that i mean this is we still have to adhere to
[3:25:50.920 --> 3:25:54.120]  even once they set the precedent that they can arrest you for saying the
[3:25:54.120 --> 3:25:57.960]  holocaust didn't happen or saying five million nine and nine thousand died
[3:25:57.960 --> 3:26:01.320]  then they can start arresting you for everything yeah bible verses dead free
[3:26:01.320 --> 3:26:04.360]  speech is purple penguin you don't say that yeah it's terrible it's dead in
[3:26:04.360 --> 3:26:08.200]  canada it's happening you guys still have the constitution
[3:26:08.200 --> 3:26:12.200]  and the bill rights protecting you in some cases but it's it's being
[3:26:12.200 --> 3:26:16.120]  uh degregated to a huge extent hey you want to host the next segment i i've
[3:26:16.120 --> 3:26:20.440]  got to go to a business meeting but you you're leaving back to toronto tomorrow
[3:26:20.440 --> 3:26:24.600]  you can come in in the next segment and actually take these phone calls
[3:26:24.600 --> 3:26:28.200]  yeah and and then cover news it's an 18 minute segment
[3:26:28.200 --> 3:26:31.720]  but right now let's go to neil in ohio neil you're on the air
[3:26:31.720 --> 3:26:36.760]  or i'm sorry that's a male name purple penguin in ohio you're on the air
[3:26:36.760 --> 3:26:41.480]  hey how you doing alex that's an honor hey uh you mentioned earlier that uh
[3:26:41.480 --> 3:26:45.560]  for us to get the information out before anything kicks off and i just wanted
[3:26:45.560 --> 3:26:49.160]  to remind your listeners that when these shooting events
[3:26:49.160 --> 3:26:52.600]  happened that uh we need to be taking notes uh to catch
[3:26:52.600 --> 3:26:56.360]  changing stories like in aurora and sandy hook
[3:26:56.360 --> 3:27:01.640]  uh and also today i was been watching the news of this shooting by the
[3:27:01.640 --> 3:27:04.600]  splannigan character and they're making a big deal about how he had a social
[3:27:04.600 --> 3:27:08.040]  media account i just was wondering your thoughts on
[3:27:08.040 --> 3:27:11.720]  obviously this is going to impact the gun control push but you think it could
[3:27:11.720 --> 3:27:15.720]  open the door for some sort of social media background checks i mean obama
[3:27:15.720 --> 3:27:18.920]  did just say ignore ideologies that run
[3:27:18.920 --> 3:27:22.920]  counter to where we need to go sure they're going to use this for cyber
[3:27:22.920 --> 3:27:26.840]  security as well but really it's a black lives matter
[3:27:26.840 --> 3:27:30.680]  looks like a mentally ill person similar to the guy that shot up the black
[3:27:30.680 --> 3:27:33.800]  people uh there in charleston so i think it's the
[3:27:33.800 --> 3:27:37.080]  same thing and it's just all part of the media making our
[3:27:37.080 --> 3:27:41.240]  problems about somebody's skin color as a diversion
[3:27:41.240 --> 3:27:44.920]  from the big megabank screwing us over neil thank you so much for the call
[3:27:44.920 --> 3:27:49.160]  jenice in illinois thanks for holding you're on the air hi thanks for taking
[3:27:49.160 --> 3:27:52.920]  my call um i wanted to agree with you strongly
[3:27:52.920 --> 3:27:56.600]  about these um uh antidepressants psychotropic
[3:27:56.600 --> 3:28:00.600]  drugs i was prescribed them in the late 90s to control chronic
[3:28:00.600 --> 3:28:04.840]  pain um i didn't have depression uh history of it
[3:28:04.840 --> 3:28:09.960]  they push it on people that have car wrecks now and i wound up overdosing on
[3:28:09.960 --> 3:28:12.280]  those pills so then they put me in a different one
[3:28:12.280 --> 3:28:16.840]  same thing i won't touch those with a 10-foot pull
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:22.760]  what was the experience like it was horrible um i finally was able to you
[3:28:22.760 --> 3:28:26.760]  know uh i fired my doctor basically and i i saw another
[3:28:26.760 --> 3:28:30.840]  doctor and he said you know you're it's the pills
[3:28:30.840 --> 3:28:34.360]  just don't take the pills i said you know what so i went against medical
[3:28:34.360 --> 3:28:39.480]  advice um i still have chronic pain i'm able to deal with it
[3:28:39.480 --> 3:28:42.600]  some days i have to lay down whatnot i'd rather have the pain the
[3:28:42.600 --> 3:28:46.360]  pain and have my brain and be able to think clearly
[3:28:46.360 --> 3:28:49.480]  well god bless you ma'am for that testimony we got a jump
[3:28:49.480 --> 3:28:52.920]  um joe biggs and this even came out in the news they would order combat trips
[3:28:52.920 --> 3:28:56.680]  to just take painkillers to get them addicted and then they would fly in
[3:28:56.680 --> 3:29:00.520]  masses of it and then afterwards they would try to use that to take their
[3:29:00.520 --> 3:29:02.760]  rights away and things once they got out of the military
[3:29:02.760 --> 3:29:06.040]  i mean this is all part of setting people up controlling people
[3:29:06.040 --> 3:29:09.560]  it's social engineering people should just be aware of it

[3:34:26.360 --> 3:34:30.040]  so we're gonna do a caller maybe let's take
[3:34:30.040 --> 3:34:35.400]  brent from texas uh hi brent you're on the alex jones show
[3:34:35.400 --> 3:34:39.560]  hi thank you for taking my call i was actually hoping to get in with
[3:34:39.560 --> 3:34:44.680]  uh or after the joke caller or the somewhat serious caller they called
[3:34:44.680 --> 3:34:50.280]  earlier regarding stating no things had happened that alex had predicted now
[3:34:50.280 --> 3:34:55.080]  you know he says there's no fema champs but it wasn't you know but two or three
[3:34:55.080 --> 3:34:58.680]  weeks ago we were reading articles about how there was secret
[3:34:58.680 --> 3:35:03.080]  detention facilities in detroit where people were being held without trial
[3:35:03.080 --> 3:35:06.440]  for indefinite periods of time now you can call it a fema
[3:35:06.440 --> 3:35:10.920]  camp call it tomato or tomato it doesn't really matter now
[3:35:10.920 --> 3:35:15.960]  regarding the fm3-39 document if you read in that document
[3:35:15.960 --> 3:35:20.760]  it states that people will be processed by their social security numbers
[3:35:20.760 --> 3:35:26.120]  and uh that the prisoners via or i guess the citizens is what we would call them
[3:35:26.120 --> 3:35:30.280]  are not going to be eligible to become any kind of trustee or
[3:35:30.280 --> 3:35:33.960]  have any job inside the prison so basically
[3:35:33.960 --> 3:35:37.640]  if you're a citizen you'll have no kind of stay so
[3:35:37.640 --> 3:35:41.720]  in these detention camps and if i may i'd like to say one more thing the
[3:35:41.720 --> 3:35:45.400]  original reason why i called in yeah go ahead of course
[3:35:45.400 --> 3:35:50.520]  all right thank you um uh around april the 20th i had called into the alex
[3:35:50.520 --> 3:35:53.960]  jones show and i had ran across information that
[3:35:53.960 --> 3:35:57.320]  said uh jade helms stood for the joint assistant for
[3:35:57.320 --> 3:36:01.960]  deployment and execution homeland eradication of local militia
[3:36:01.960 --> 3:36:05.160]  now when i called in and said that you know david night
[3:36:05.160 --> 3:36:09.320]  uh was the person taking calls at the time he actually
[3:36:09.320 --> 3:36:13.480]  chastised me a bit stating you know that we need hard evidence
[3:36:13.480 --> 3:36:17.320]  with claims such as these which is totally understandable
[3:36:17.320 --> 3:36:21.320]  but since that time i've heard callers call in stating
[3:36:21.320 --> 3:36:24.440]  that alex jones had said this himself now that is
[3:36:24.440 --> 3:36:28.440]  totally not true and the only thing that i have heard alex jones mentioned on
[3:36:28.440 --> 3:36:32.200]  this i believe it was around april 23rd or 24th
[3:36:32.200 --> 3:36:36.120]  he stated there was a man that used to have a radio station
[3:36:36.120 --> 3:36:39.400]  or a radio program in austin named sergeant
[3:36:39.400 --> 3:36:43.720]  sam or something along those lines that he had got that information from
[3:36:43.720 --> 3:36:47.000]  but at no point in time that alex say this was
[3:36:47.000 --> 3:36:51.080]  uh his information that he had got or that it was set in stone
[3:36:51.080 --> 3:36:54.200]  so this is just once again people trying to
[3:36:54.200 --> 3:36:57.800]  play words out of each other to fit their agenda instead of looking at the
[3:36:57.800 --> 3:37:01.560]  actual picture and seeing the truth and things right and
[3:37:01.560 --> 3:37:07.400]  we have this kind of mentality where we run a narrative in our own minds and
[3:37:07.400 --> 3:37:10.600]  it's like a stage play you you have a character that you've
[3:37:10.600 --> 3:37:14.200]  been programmed to play and you do it because your
[3:37:14.200 --> 3:37:17.800]  overlords are watching and they reward you when you when you play your role
[3:37:17.800 --> 3:37:23.240]  properly and what is this hypocrisy about uh you know i understand the full
[3:37:23.240 --> 3:37:26.520]  legitimate proof but the government is all about
[3:37:26.520 --> 3:37:30.360]  preventative action and they don't have full legitimate proof of a lot of things
[3:37:30.360 --> 3:37:34.360]  that they claim to be protecting us against yet they get to uh do the
[3:37:34.360 --> 3:37:38.680]  preemptive and the preventative uh systematic action against us to
[3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:42.120]  protect us yet we're not allowed to do the same i
[3:37:42.120 --> 3:37:46.440]  mean what we can't own guns because you know
[3:37:46.440 --> 3:37:49.480]  everyone's okay and everything you know we're paranoid and everything's all
[3:37:49.480 --> 3:37:52.760]  right and everything's safe well what if it isn't why can't we have the option
[3:37:52.760 --> 3:37:56.600]  of this preventative self-defense and i come from
[3:37:56.600 --> 3:38:01.560]  i come from the former soviet union and we invented fema cams we had
[3:38:01.560 --> 3:38:07.960]  the largest gulag system ever and we still have it and it's actually
[3:38:07.960 --> 3:38:12.280]  i'll tie this into the floor a fluoride debate i don't need any proof about
[3:38:12.280 --> 3:38:16.280]  whether fluoride is good or bad for you the only fact i need to know is that
[3:38:16.280 --> 3:38:19.720]  the first time fluoridation was used in water was
[3:38:19.720 --> 3:38:22.920]  for the water sources of the prisoners in the
[3:38:22.920 --> 3:38:29.800]  huge gulag system in syberia and that was to pacify the people so no riots
[3:38:29.800 --> 3:38:33.720]  would erupt uh let's take another caller what about
[3:38:33.720 --> 3:38:37.640]  um paul from new mexico paul you're on the air
[3:38:37.640 --> 3:38:41.720]  on the alex jones show and uh you're speaking to julie transky of brave the
[3:38:41.720 --> 3:38:47.080]  world dot com yeah um i wanted to like uh
[3:38:47.080 --> 3:38:50.680]  pose a question to all the people out there who are listening
[3:38:50.680 --> 3:38:54.840]  i'd say who's the blame for this for the shooting
[3:38:54.840 --> 3:39:04.120]  choice a the guns b the second amendment c the individual d ssri drugs
[3:39:04.120 --> 3:39:08.440]  e our culture that they put the agenda that there are culture pushes
[3:39:08.440 --> 3:39:15.480]  or choice uh f both c and d it's the individual
[3:39:15.480 --> 3:39:20.440]  and the ssri drugs right because because the individual is not an island
[3:39:20.440 --> 3:39:24.920]  the individual is influenced and sculpted by factors so of course it has to
[3:39:24.920 --> 3:39:27.720]  be more than one
[3:39:28.360 --> 3:39:31.960]  yeah and you know it's just like how they they culturally and uh
[3:39:31.960 --> 3:39:37.640]  they uh collectively and selectively um the the gatekeepers decide what's
[3:39:37.640 --> 3:39:41.080]  going to be reported on what's not going to be reported on to push their
[3:39:41.080 --> 3:39:45.720]  agenda to destroy the bill of rights in our constitution
[3:39:45.720 --> 3:39:53.320]  as a humanity is manipulated um into a global order and as a
[3:39:53.320 --> 3:39:57.080]  institution as we're bought off by the institutions as the global spy off the
[3:39:57.080 --> 3:40:03.640]  institutions our sheriffs our our mayors our politicians it's like are we
[3:40:03.640 --> 3:40:08.200]  going to selectively blame uh alex for driving his dodge
[3:40:08.200 --> 3:40:11.480]  hellcat through an intersection and killing the family are we going to
[3:40:11.480 --> 3:40:14.840]  now ban all the dodge hellcats that are out there
[3:40:14.840 --> 3:40:18.440]  um that's why i don't trust trump because
[3:40:18.440 --> 3:40:22.840]  yeah he pays for all his favors you know he pays buys off corporations and
[3:40:22.840 --> 3:40:30.120]  whatnot versus like uh um what uh brand paul you know he
[3:40:30.120 --> 3:40:34.360]  asked for contributions from he asked for favors he asked for contributions
[3:40:34.360 --> 3:40:38.920]  from his boss right well it's interesting when a crook admits
[3:40:38.920 --> 3:40:42.280]  he's a crook because the system allows him to be right
[3:40:42.280 --> 3:40:46.920]  very very good points thank you eric um let's go to
[3:40:46.920 --> 3:40:50.920]  dav dav you're on the alex stone show
[3:40:50.920 --> 3:40:54.760]  hi julia i think you're gonna be a good a good gas toast keep it up
[3:40:54.760 --> 3:40:59.560]  thank you i'd like to move here you know um i never i'm sorry to interrupt your
[3:40:59.560 --> 3:41:03.080]  call but i just really want to point out my love for austin because
[3:41:03.080 --> 3:41:06.840]  as soon as i got here i go to gas station and a 16 year old boy
[3:41:06.840 --> 3:41:10.600]  opens the door for me and i walk through and i say thank you very much and he
[3:41:10.600 --> 3:41:15.480]  says yes ma'am i'm living in san francisco for a month
[3:41:15.480 --> 3:41:19.720]  nothing even came close to like to that so i just i love it here but go on what
[3:41:19.720 --> 3:41:23.400]  would you like to say okay well a couple things one is i think
[3:41:23.400 --> 3:41:25.960]  they should put a fence around washington dc
[3:41:25.960 --> 3:41:29.880]  actually parts of northern california are really nice and old-fashioned
[3:41:29.880 --> 3:41:34.440]  and i've lived here a long time i mean i'm basically uh california redneck so
[3:41:34.440 --> 3:41:40.840]  we're all like like that uh and my comment was uh specific to
[3:41:40.840 --> 3:41:44.600]  the film that you did a long time ago on feminism which was my first
[3:41:44.600 --> 3:41:49.720]  real exposure thank you for watching and i took that film and i posted links to it
[3:41:49.720 --> 3:41:53.560]  in cindy shehans uh cindy shehan for president's site
[3:41:53.560 --> 3:41:56.920]  because i like cindy shehan i liked a lot of what she said in particular
[3:41:56.920 --> 3:42:02.360]  anti-war stance and boy did i get clobbered for that i got booted out of her
[3:42:02.360 --> 3:42:06.200]  you know i mean it was it was the end well you're a man you're not allowed to
[3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:11.800]  have a voice on off feminism anyway no great loss but uh i have a question
[3:42:11.800 --> 3:42:14.760]  for you and then i'll take the answer off air if you don't mind
[3:42:14.760 --> 3:42:18.600]  uh canada could you talk about canada a little bit more you seem to have quite
[3:42:18.600 --> 3:42:22.280]  a bit of experience it's been really nice talking to you
[3:42:22.280 --> 3:42:28.040]  okay uh canada all right well i guess it can start with some of our
[3:42:28.040 --> 3:42:31.640]  gun laws i mean canada has a really bad one where
[3:42:31.640 --> 3:42:37.000]  if you have your gun license and it expires then you're treated as a criminal
[3:42:37.000 --> 3:42:39.720]  so although i took the course and i legally
[3:42:39.720 --> 3:42:43.720]  own a gun and i know i have all my right papers
[3:42:43.720 --> 3:42:47.960]  if i forget or i'm hospitalized or something
[3:42:47.960 --> 3:42:53.080]  um and i don't file to my overlords and get that piece of paper renewed
[3:42:53.080 --> 3:42:57.800]  then i am a criminal and i can go to jail for having an expired gun license
[3:42:57.800 --> 3:43:03.080]  so that's that's one thing that's quite sad about the state of affairs there
[3:43:03.080 --> 3:43:07.400]  canada has very rich gun ownership very rich hunting community
[3:43:07.400 --> 3:43:12.520]  and aside from the major cities you drive out a little bit and
[3:43:12.520 --> 3:43:16.760]  the people are actually very american in mentality if i can say that
[3:43:16.760 --> 3:43:21.160]  because canadians in cities tend to have this bigotry against americans
[3:43:21.160 --> 3:43:26.360]  you know they i've i've used the term america to encompass the whole
[3:43:26.360 --> 3:43:30.840]  continent and they say things like oh don't don't put us in the same category
[3:43:30.840 --> 3:43:34.200]  as the united states like we're better i mean well
[3:43:34.200 --> 3:43:41.160]  canada is america's hat like we kind of um like harper panders to america
[3:43:41.160 --> 3:43:46.680]  and our government officials take the blueprint of america and
[3:43:46.680 --> 3:43:49.720]  do a lot of things in canada with it and apart from our
[3:43:49.720 --> 3:43:53.640]  socialist health care it's not that different i mean of course the people
[3:43:53.640 --> 3:43:56.920]  are different but it's not that different um
[3:43:56.920 --> 3:43:59.640]  i don't know the health care thing people bring up
[3:43:59.640 --> 3:44:04.680]  oh we have really wonderful health care canada has amazing health care if your
[3:44:04.680 --> 3:44:08.360]  bone is sticking out and you're visibly bleeding and in pain
[3:44:08.360 --> 3:44:11.560]  if something's wrong with you chronically internally something's
[3:44:11.560 --> 3:44:15.800]  undiagnosed you need a specialist there's a very high chance that you will die
[3:44:15.800 --> 3:44:20.760]  and we have one of the highest rates of deaths in waiting rooms
[3:44:20.760 --> 3:44:27.160]  what else can i say about canada um beautiful country passive people
[3:44:27.160 --> 3:44:30.920]  very you know again in the major cities like in most places very
[3:44:30.920 --> 3:44:36.200]  liberal and progressive and because we have such a high standard of living
[3:44:36.200 --> 3:44:40.520]  people don't really pay attention to the realities that
[3:44:40.520 --> 3:44:45.560]  others face although there are so many cases in canada
[3:44:45.560 --> 3:44:50.280]  that go overlooked in terms of rights and freedom of
[3:44:50.280 --> 3:44:54.520]  speech i have something on my website about our
[3:44:54.520 --> 3:44:59.080]  anti-defamation law and that's pretty terrible basically if you say anything
[3:44:59.080 --> 3:45:04.120]  about anybody in canada they can sue you dry for
[3:45:04.120 --> 3:45:07.720]  anti-defamation and the funniest thing about that
[3:45:07.720 --> 3:45:11.880]  law you don't even have to prove that the person was
[3:45:11.880 --> 3:45:19.160]  the person's reputation or career or persona was hurt or damaged in any way
[3:45:19.160 --> 3:45:22.360]  when you file an anti-defamation lawsuit it is
[3:45:22.360 --> 3:45:27.640]  presupposed that defamation occurred so that's the unique thing about canada as
[3:45:27.640 --> 3:45:32.440]  well and i guess i'll end on the most tragic one of our
[3:45:32.440 --> 3:45:36.360]  it's not even a law it's a lack of law canada
[3:45:36.360 --> 3:45:41.640]  is one of the three countries that has abortion to the moment of birth
[3:45:41.640 --> 3:45:45.240]  so we're in the same category as north korea
[3:45:45.240 --> 3:45:49.480]  china and canada you can abort a baby
[3:45:49.480 --> 3:45:54.200]  as long like up to the moment of birth so it's not a human being until it fully
[3:45:54.200 --> 3:45:57.720]  exits the birth canal and i know they even use that
[3:45:57.720 --> 3:46:02.520]  kind of they use that as an out for in plant parenthood for legal
[3:46:02.520 --> 3:46:05.880]  late term abortion like post-abortion so if the head is out
[3:46:05.880 --> 3:46:09.880]  they can kill the child because the head because the rest of the body is still in
[3:46:09.880 --> 3:46:12.920]  the mother so that's quite a sad thing about my
[3:46:12.920 --> 3:46:18.120]  country um let's take another caller um
[3:46:18.120 --> 3:46:24.120]  steve from virginia you're on the air on the alex joneshow with juet ransky of
[3:46:24.120 --> 3:46:28.040]  brave the world it's ram it's nice to meet you
[3:46:28.040 --> 3:46:31.880]  julia um i live in lindon virginia apparently the
[3:46:31.880 --> 3:46:35.560]  shooter uh who killed those people in norfolk uh
[3:46:35.560 --> 3:46:41.240]  shot himself over near my neighborhood now a couple strange things
[3:46:41.240 --> 3:46:47.240]  that have been going on um first of all they've had the highway locked down
[3:46:47.240 --> 3:46:53.400]  route 66 eastbound the i live next off the route 55 here
[3:46:53.400 --> 3:46:59.720]  and there have been trucks semi trucks and a lot more traffic on 55 because they
[3:46:59.720 --> 3:47:04.920]  i guess they maybe cut out 66 between the mark of exit that's exit 18
[3:47:04.920 --> 3:47:09.640]  and exit 13 the linden exit for the crime scene investigation dealing with
[3:47:09.640 --> 3:47:14.040]  this issue but the strangest thing that me and my
[3:47:14.040 --> 3:47:18.840]  my neighbors and i noticed was that over an hour and a half
[3:47:18.840 --> 3:47:22.680]  after the announcement that the gunman had shot himself
[3:47:22.680 --> 3:47:25.960]  there were several helicopters in the area here
[3:47:25.960 --> 3:47:31.480]  and a couple of them were really close to they were flying at three top level
[3:47:31.480 --> 3:47:36.120]  it seemed to be that they were looking for someone or something
[3:47:36.120 --> 3:47:42.680]  and yet an hour and a half before that i mean they were flying low
[3:47:42.680 --> 3:47:46.200]  and all over the place they were looking for something after
[3:47:46.200 --> 3:47:50.200]  the press announced that he had shot himself over an hour and a half now we
[3:47:50.200 --> 3:47:54.440]  had up to 10 helicopters here today they're all gone now
[3:47:54.440 --> 3:47:59.400]  but i don't think that this situation i don't think what they're telling us is
[3:47:59.400 --> 3:48:02.840]  all of the story i'm not going to say for sure that
[3:48:02.840 --> 3:48:06.440]  i don't know if there was an accomplice or something
[3:48:06.440 --> 3:48:14.440]  but something is not right you should write all that up and try to submit it
[3:48:14.440 --> 3:48:17.880]  well i i'm sorry i pulled you out i pulled the sound out for a second you
[3:48:17.880 --> 3:48:21.320]  should write all that up and try to submit it to maybe any kind of media
[3:48:21.320 --> 3:48:25.800]  outlet that would take you get it out there
[3:48:25.800 --> 3:48:30.360]  well i mean i i think a great place is calling in to info wars yeah for sure
[3:48:30.360 --> 3:48:34.200]  i've never i've never called in before i'm a tradesman
[3:48:34.200 --> 3:48:38.120]  you know i got my own business whatever i got a job i'm a tradesman
[3:48:38.120 --> 3:48:42.920]  i would happen to be off today when this happened but i think it would be i think
[3:48:42.920 --> 3:48:47.640]  it'd be a great idea to just send in your observation to all of the kind of
[3:48:47.640 --> 3:48:51.560]  more like more of the mainstream dinosaur media too because
[3:48:51.560 --> 3:48:55.240]  we do have a specific audience and it would be like i always
[3:48:55.240 --> 3:48:59.240]  comment even about my own channel like how do you escape the petri dish of
[3:48:59.240 --> 3:49:03.160]  libertarianism and anarchism and people who are into
[3:49:03.160 --> 3:49:07.480]  freedom in general so that people like you who observe things you know first
[3:49:07.480 --> 3:49:10.040]  hand and actually getting out you know journalists
[3:49:10.040 --> 3:49:13.160]  you know they have an agenda but then of the day they need something to report
[3:49:13.160 --> 3:49:15.560]  they always want to get some new information so i would
[3:49:15.560 --> 3:49:18.760]  highly recommend just send you know trying to get through to them a little
[3:49:18.760 --> 3:49:22.120]  bit let me just say this in in reference to
[3:49:22.120 --> 3:49:26.360]  that i did we had a situation out here i live next to the train tracks and they'd
[3:49:26.360 --> 3:49:31.080]  been blocking us in for years now for hours on end
[3:49:31.080 --> 3:49:37.240]  hundreds of times and finally um we got seven on your side that's wjla that's
[3:49:37.240 --> 3:49:40.760]  the local news service and i they sent out a reporter
[3:49:40.760 --> 3:49:45.000]  steven cheetah to do the uh report here he used to work for fairfax channel
[3:49:45.000 --> 3:49:48.840]  eight news but here's what happened i called him today about it and they said
[3:49:48.840 --> 3:49:53.560]  thanks we're not interested so i did make an effort just calling them today and
[3:49:53.560 --> 3:49:57.880]  reference reference the train track situation yeah that's the problem with
[3:49:57.880 --> 3:50:00.920]  those guys right they they can be very selective with their
[3:50:00.920 --> 3:50:06.120]  information but thank you so much for sharing on the air

[3:53:59.960 --> 3:54:03.800]  hi there welcome back to the alex jones show my name is julie taransky
[3:54:03.800 --> 3:54:07.880]  and i am from brave the world dot com filling in
[3:54:07.880 --> 3:54:12.440]  for alex the previous caller just asked me about what i think
[3:54:12.440 --> 3:54:16.520]  the block increased debate and for bitcoin so there's
[3:54:16.520 --> 3:54:22.280]  xt which is being pushed by her and gavin and gresen who is self-coin
[3:54:22.280 --> 3:54:26.600]  himself as chief uh chief engineer of bitcoin
[3:54:26.600 --> 3:54:30.360]  and they've been pushing this for over a year like this is a new news to me this
[3:54:30.360 --> 3:54:33.640]  has been a problem in the community for a while it's just new news because it's
[3:54:33.640 --> 3:54:37.160]  become very mainstream and basically they've discredited
[3:54:37.160 --> 3:54:40.920]  themselves and they um you know her and everything
[3:54:40.920 --> 3:54:45.640]  herne has pushed throughout the years has been very
[3:54:45.640 --> 3:54:48.840]  pushing for centrality or resulting and everything is pushed
[3:54:48.840 --> 3:54:53.240]  will result in centralization uh over you know people
[3:54:53.240 --> 3:54:59.080]  one person overseeing everything um he called he wanted like a more democratic
[3:54:59.080 --> 3:55:03.000]  mining strategy which would make miners be able to vote
[3:55:03.000 --> 3:55:07.400]  uh penalties on to each other he wants red lists so a lot of people actually
[3:55:07.400 --> 3:55:12.440]  suspect that herne is working for uh mi6 or some sort of
[3:55:12.440 --> 3:55:17.880]  government agency and is there like as a state shield to disrupt the technology
[3:55:17.880 --> 3:55:21.960]  which otherwise is doing quite well um gavin is
[3:55:21.960 --> 3:55:25.400]  you know just become the cult of personality in bitcoin and
[3:55:25.400 --> 3:55:29.080]  you know when you have a benevolent leader they're benevolent until they're
[3:55:29.080 --> 3:55:32.440]  not and nobody really accepted him as their
[3:55:32.440 --> 3:55:36.120]  leader anyways that was all publicly publicly constructed
[3:55:36.120 --> 3:55:41.480]  through the numerous interviews he's done so xd is a terrible idea and i would
[3:55:41.480 --> 3:55:45.400]  take all the other core developers much more seriously who are organizing an
[3:55:45.400 --> 3:55:49.480]  event in montrealk this coming september to have an open
[3:55:49.480 --> 3:55:53.800]  dialogue about the changes and how we can maybe implement them
[3:55:53.800 --> 3:55:56.840]  incrementally and what is the best way of going about it
[3:55:56.840 --> 3:56:02.680]  so that's my opinion on that and actually had um a boy from uh
[3:56:02.680 --> 3:56:06.120]  blog stream which is a company that employs these core devs be on the
[3:56:06.120 --> 3:56:08.440]  crypto show the other day so if you want to look up that
[3:56:08.440 --> 3:56:13.800]  episode on the cryptoshow.com he really lays down uh that the technical
[3:56:13.800 --> 3:56:18.200]  aspect and the political aspect very well his name is johnny dilly
[3:56:18.200 --> 3:56:22.680]  um i can't go to the next caller we don't have that much time left i'm so sorry
[3:56:22.680 --> 3:56:26.120]  jason uh but please call it back next time
[3:56:26.120 --> 3:56:30.040]  so i want to maybe wrap up with since it's quite topical
[3:56:30.040 --> 3:56:34.520]  now with plant parenthood leaks uh the abortion debate
[3:56:34.520 --> 3:56:40.120]  and i mentioned that in canada we have a abortion up to the moment of birth
[3:56:40.120 --> 3:56:45.240]  and i have a great video that i put forth that doesn't take
[3:56:45.240 --> 3:56:49.240]  any kind of approach from an agenda perspective and
[3:56:49.240 --> 3:56:53.000]  if you guys want to just play the start of it
[3:56:53.000 --> 3:56:57.160]  most of us have a very strong opinion about abortion
[3:56:57.160 --> 3:57:04.040]  this video is going to show you just how baseless that opinion is
[3:57:04.040 --> 3:57:08.280]  it's easy to pick a side and never reconsider it we don't really like to
[3:57:08.280 --> 3:57:13.400]  think about heavy things for too long but this is a disgrace to logic
[3:57:13.400 --> 3:57:17.560]  and in the case of abortion it's unforgivable now i won't be arguing
[3:57:17.560 --> 3:57:20.920]  whether abortion is okay based on religion feminism
[3:57:20.920 --> 3:57:24.920]  or what your president says abortion is a purely
[3:57:24.920 --> 3:57:31.720]  ethical issue so i'm gonna just elaborate on that
[3:57:31.720 --> 3:57:35.480]  the the whole debate has been hijacked uh
[3:57:35.480 --> 3:57:39.800]  with the political distinction between pro-life
[3:57:39.800 --> 3:57:43.400]  and pro-choice and now the liberals are taking this new term
[3:57:43.400 --> 3:57:47.320]  saying anti-choice which is uh radicalizing the issue even further
[3:57:47.320 --> 3:57:52.920]  anti-choice whereas the pro-lifers are not anti-choice because
[3:57:52.920 --> 3:57:57.080]  pro-choice is anti-choice where is the all the women that are
[3:57:57.080 --> 3:58:01.080]  aborted every year where is their choice they didn't have a
[3:58:01.080 --> 3:58:04.200]  choice in life they're killed before they're allowed to make that choice
[3:58:04.200 --> 3:58:07.960]  because they're still human beings by every definition or
[3:58:07.960 --> 3:58:11.880]  non-definition that we have it's all arbitrary so check out that video you
[3:58:11.880 --> 3:58:15.160]  can find all my work on bravetheworld.com
