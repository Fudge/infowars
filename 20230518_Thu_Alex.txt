[00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.640]  Stand up against the poison of white supremacy as I did my inaugural address to a single out
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.280]  as the most dangerous terrorist threat to our homeland is white supremacy.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.560]  Congress, I'll give you five damn good reasons why the 46th president of the United States,
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:22.880]  Joe Biden, should be impeached, and I'll make it easy. I won't even bring up the
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:29.040]  fraudulent elections. Number one, treason. Chinese nationals affiliated with the Bidens
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.000]  created limited liability companies in the United States, and then in a short period of time,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.280]  transferred their interest to a Chinese company that sent money to the Bidens.
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.480]  Number two, mental fitness. According to the 25th amendment,
[00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.120]  Joe Biden does not have the mental fitness to be president, and even he knows it.
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.640]  You know, you don't have to stand every time I hear hail of the chief lender, where the hell is he?
[00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.880]  Took me a long while. You think I'm joking? I'm not.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.680]  Turn around and where's the president? Number three, economic sabotage. Joe Biden has
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.880]  single-handedly driven the nation to the brink of a collapse after shutting down our resources,
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.560]  depleting our oil reserves, and bleeding our military dry, all in the name of a foreign
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.600]  globalist agenda. Number four, all the kids under the age of 15, come on up here.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.800]  Heinous felonies. There may be compromising evidence that Joe Biden is a hardcore pedophile
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.200]  behind closed doors while overseeing a global sex trafficking operation. And five,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.280]  national security breach. Aside from allowing the Chinese to gather key information on our
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:46.080]  military installations via spy balloons. The idea that it was a dereliction of duty is,
[00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:53.360]  I think is a bizarre notion. Biden told the crowd at a private fundraiser in New York,
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.000]  we have not faced the prospect of Armageddon since Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.520]  Don't think there is any such thing as the ability to easily use a tactical nuclear weapon
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.640]  and not end up with Armageddon. Since Joe Biden took office,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.640]  five million illegal border crossers encountered, two million illegal aliens
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.600]  released into the country, another two million, over 370,000 unaccompanied alien children
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.640]  have been encountered on the border. And the Biden administration has lost track of 85,000
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:27.120]  kids, 85,000 of that number, and nearly 200 on the terrorist watch list have been encountered
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:34.080]  on our border. Here's the kicker. It's all been done intentionally. Day one, January 20th, 2021,
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.320]  Joe Biden said no more wall, no more remain in Mexico. You get to the border, you get released
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.840]  into the country. Of course, Joe Biden is merely the current visage of a cabal caught with their
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.800]  pants down by the Durham investigation, a treasonous bureaucratic media monstrosity
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.440]  that knowingly lied to the American people, yet faces no repercussions.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.240]  Do you have direct evidence of collusion with Russia?
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.560]  Well, I think there is direct evidence. While there is abundant evidence of collusion,
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.280]  but as I've said along, there's plenty of evidence of collusion.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.120]  Donald Trump engaged in perverted acts with prostitutes.
[00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.720]  In reality, A, a bunch of the dossier has proven to be true.
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.160]  B, the FBI and the CIA have reportedly validated parts of it as true.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.680]  Investigators have corroborated part of the dossier.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.480]  The dossier has been corroborated by the intelligence community.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.480]  US investigators have corroborated some of the allegations in that dossier.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.040]  We do know that parts of it have been corroborated.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.960]  Some of it, we did corroborate in the ICA. And of course,
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.600]  it appears that more of it has been corroborated.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.280]  Many of the things represented in the Steele reports were in fact true.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.200]  So Andrew, in the Durham report, it says the FBI never had evidence of collusion.
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.680]  That's not a legal term we should note. Between the Trump campaign and Russia in 2016,
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.320]  should never have launched a full investigation. What's your response?
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.400]  Yeah, I vehemently disagree with Mr. Durham's characterizations of what we did in the report.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.120]  The time for weaponizing the Department of Justice needs to come to an end.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.120]  And because you refuse to prosecute real criminals that are violating all the crimes here in
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.760]  Washington, D.C., and you want to talk about D.C. residents, they are victims of your abuse of power.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.680]  And because of that, I am introducing articles of impeachment on you, Mr. Graves.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.720]  Immediately, the thoughts of impeachment bring up the nightmare of a Kamala Harris presidency.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.600]  My mother used to, she would give us a hard time sometimes and she would say to us,
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.080]  I don't know what's wrong with you young people. You think you just fell out of a coconut tree?
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.640]  You exist in the context.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.400]  But isn't that the very reason she is there? Impeach Joe Biden now or suffer the consequences
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.280]  before irreversible damage is done. John Bowne reporting.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:06.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.560]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds. If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.920]  zone website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability in the world
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:25.600]  is iodine deficiency. The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:31.840]  pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine,
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.960]  and so much more. Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007 worldwide
[00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:44.160]  have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine. Most iodine is bound
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.600]  to other elements. You don't absorb it. We have X3, all three types of good iodine together that
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.200]  supercharges your body. X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com for being sold out for over
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:00.720]  six months for 25% off. X3 back in stock. Take action now. Infowarsstore.com.
[00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:08.560]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:15.120]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:31.040]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas, transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.360]  In the last 14 hours or so,
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.240]  before I went to bed last night, before I got up at 6 a.m. this morning,
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:54.960]  something really happened to me. I crossed into a new mental space
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:06.400]  that I've never really experienced before, and I'm having trouble describing it, but it is a
[00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.880]  brainwave or mindset
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.840]  that I would describe as a mixture of
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:34.160]  sadness and of responsibility and of determination
[00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.120]  and of urgency, but also extremely calm.
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:53.280]  And committed. Now, everything I'm going to cover here today, we all basically already know is true
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:59.360]  and going on. What is wild about it is that it's all being admitted out in the open,
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:06.080]  and if we do not address this and if we do not change this now,
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.720]  we have already basically gone over the edge of a cliff, but we have a parachute we can pull
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.240]  before we hit the bottom, but we've jumped off the 5,000-foot cliff,
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:23.200]  and we've already fallen about 1,000 feet, and very soon, if we don't pull the chute,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.120]  collectively, we are all going to be destroyed. That's guaranteed.
[00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:36.320]  And then I think about the evil people that are doing this at the top down to their men's bottom,
[00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:42.240]  and I just see so clearly, historically, how this has happened before, and I can see really the
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:51.280]  algorithm of evil that they're using for control. Now, each one of these stories,
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:54.960]  and there's six or seven that all tie together, maybe eight,
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:06.800]  all complement each other in understanding what's unfolding, and each one is devastating,
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:14.160]  devastating in what it means and the ramifications.
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.120]  And each one of these stories, we could talk for the next four hours about just one of them.
[00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:29.200]  So let me just calmly read you some of the headlines and then get into the stories,
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.160]  but it's not just the stories, it's that they're telling you this now.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:42.960]  Here's one of them, CNBC, a secretive annual meeting attended by the world's elite has AI
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:50.160]  top of the agenda. They go on to say the Bilderberg Group is meeting in Portugal,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.920]  and that world leaders will secretly be there along with the heads of big tech and banks,
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:03.440]  and that they're going to save us with a world government plan to protect us from the AI.
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.920]  They're launching against us. Now, I'm going to obviously cover that report.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:15.920]  We have the participant list. Now, just a few years ago, we talked about this.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:22.880]  The ADL would say you were a Nazi. What does this have to do with Nazis
[00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:28.400]  to expose people that act about as close to the Nazis as I've ever seen?
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.720]  And then that ties into this bombshell report that's on Infowars.com
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:45.040]  from the National Archives, and the ADL is proud of this and wants you to know that for 60 years,
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.960]  they've been secret police in America that have infiltrated groups, and I believe what they
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:56.560]  describe as criminal. They got criminally indicted for breaking into police stations,
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.640]  robbing files in San Francisco and other areas. But when I tell you the ADL is at the heart of
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.960]  quarterbacking this stuff on the ground, and I describe how they work with the Justice Department
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:14.960]  and the CIA, they have released this and are proud to let you know because now they've gone from beta
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.560]  to full operational. From the school boards on up,
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:24.560]  there are calamities about to hit us economically, culturally, militarily.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:34.160]  That are already hitting, that the system plans to really go the final step of assassinating
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:39.200]  any populist, anyone that stands against what's happening,
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.240]  and or putting us in slave labor camps, which the left's calling for.
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.440]  Yeah, there it is. Oh, drudge, Bilderberg elites, meet in Lisbon, the future of AI,
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.560]  list participants. I thought that didn't exist. I thought the ADL said,
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:58.640]  the Southern Poverty Law Center and the New York Times, I remember just like six years ago,
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:03.760]  said I was insane and racist and that the globalism doesn't exist and neither does the
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:12.080]  Bilderberg group. But let's talk about what's really going on here because by having the ADL
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:16.080]  come out and attack anybody that doesn't want to be a slave and calling everybody anti-Semitic,
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:23.840]  that actually paints the target in the media and in the culture that it is Jews that run it.
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:30.640]  And then there's persecution of Jews and the ADL gets more money. But at the end of the day,
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.560]  there are a lot of powerful Jews that are in the New World Order. But in the final equation,
[00:12:34.560 --> 00:12:41.840]  it's not about what religious or racial group people are. It is about human animal cloning.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:47.120]  It is about euthanasia. It is about forced abortion. It is about sterilizing children.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:54.800]  It is a biomedical mad scientist depopulation tyranny at the top that makes Hitler look like
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:59.120]  a lightweight. But imagine if the Nazis had been more sophisticated
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:03.120]  and attacked for the food and water and culture, which they had plans
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:09.760]  once they took over to do covertly. Imagine if they'd have hired a leftist Jewish organization
[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:16.560]  to be their front group. The Nazis would have won. Now, the Nazis aren't secretly
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:24.400]  with Red Skull running the New World Order. The Nazis were a bad son or a branch of the
[00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:30.000]  eugenics globalist system that was set up and allowed to operate to then bring in the UN
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.480]  and the New World Order we're under today. So I'm not being an apologist
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:42.480]  for any of these extremist groups, whether it be the ADL or the KKK.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:48.400]  The difference is the KKK doesn't secretly control much of the police and the Justice
[00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.120]  Department and the rest of it. But there's groups above that as well.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:58.480]  We're going to talk about it today. But why would they come out and get
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:06.560]  National Archives documents and then put them out publicly and say, we've been infiltrating
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:11.760]  right wing groups and posing as racist to discredit them since the 60s?
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:15.200]  Well, we already know that. What do you think Patriot Front is?
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:23.600]  But here they are saying we infiltrate groups and then we try to say racist
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.440]  things at press conferences and things to make mainline conservatives look bad.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:31.360]  It's a false flag. Well, I told you about some of the employees here
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:35.600]  before they left to go write exposes about us and be left at STARS.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:38.480]  I'm not going to name their names. I'm going to put the articles up.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:44.480]  They went around the office before they quit trying to get us to say racist things. Of course,
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.840]  we didn't. But that's ADL. And I said, I said it's we know it's we know they were in fact,
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.880]  it came out they were working with the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:59.120]  They've written articles about it. So the level of nastiness here, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:06.240]  is next level. But that's nothing. That's that's only the front of this.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:10.320]  OK, let's talk about what the new order really is when we come back. OK.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.120]  In 130 plus U.S. hospitals, there's now whistleblowers,
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:20.560]  documents and recordings coming out. But we already knew this. But now it's confirmed.
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:31.680]  They had special floors set up in most cases with people that weren't even doctors or nurses,
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.400]  but were technicians. So they said your family can't come see you and had quotas.
[00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:39.200]  And we know the fifty one thousand dollar bonus for killing somebody.
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:45.840]  But now the insiders are coming out. Think of the organized evil of that. That's the point.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.760]  Can you organize people to kill people in front of everybody and get away with it?
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:54.880]  I mean, people, the ADL, is this really what you want to be part of?
[00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.280]  I mean, come on, man. Really, you're that bad.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:04.240]  Please give me one minute of your time. Please write this down and please go look this up.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.360]  It will change your life. The U.N. admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:15.040]  that upwards of two billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:21.360]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine. Most iodine in the
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:28.080]  environment is bound to other elements. So your body can't absorb it. Only pure iodine
[00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:34.160]  can really be absorbed right into the cells. And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.920]  that actually has this type of full effect. Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:44.640]  months. It's very hard to produce, and it's finally back in stock. In fact, I was just
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.600]  taking some before I shot this ad. This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful. You and your family
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:56.560]  need it. It's 25 percent off, back in stock. X3. Try iodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:59.600]  Take action now. But regardless, research is info.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:04.160]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:08.240]  Carlson and take him off the air. People said, no way. He's the most powerful that ever happened.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.000]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money. They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.520]  believed they could control him. But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:21.120]  the air. It's the same thing with Infowars. But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:27.120]  George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan. We are only beholden to our viewers and our
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:32.400]  listeners. And when you support us, we're unstoppable. I'm not underwritten by Rupert
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:39.200]  Murdoch or by George Soros. I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people. So I want to
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:42.000]  thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:47.200]  Please don't take Infowars for granted. We're barely hanging on. We need your word of mouth,
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.640]  your prayer and your financial support while getting great products at the same time at

[00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:02.000]  keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants. Iodine is naturally acquired through
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.920]  the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food supply. Modern farming techniques
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:13.600]  have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which has caused an iodine deficiency
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:18.240]  in about half the population. And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:24.000]  We need to practice more regenerative farming. There are plenty of proven technologies in
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.640]  permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine. And we need to
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:37.920]  ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day derived from ancient sea salts found
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:45.440]  thousands of feet below the earth's surface. Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:54.000]  the best. Pure nascent iodine stabilized in an activated triiodine form for a healthy thyroid
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:19:00.160]  and a healthy metabolism. Get yours now at Infowarsstore.com. I want to thank all of you
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.840]  over the years who have supported Infowars financially with word of mouth and prayer.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.240]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that we're not
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:14.240]  caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you. Humanity has a real fighting
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:18.800]  chance. I just want to thank you all for buying products at Infowarsstore.com like books and
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:23.040]  films and supplements and water filtration, air filtration, so much more. But for those of you

[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:08.720]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order. It's Alex Jones.
[00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:24.630]  God is real, and only reaching your hands out to the heavens and asking God to come
[00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:31.630]  into your cells, into your electrochemical systems, can purge you and block you from
[00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:35.190]  the enemy's frequency.
[00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:42.710]  Reach your hands out like a tree's branches to the sun, to the stars, to the firmament,
[00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:50.510]  the proof of God's incredible intention, and pray, pray for an awakening.
[00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:57.670]  Yes, it's begun, but this is only the start of something that will lead humanity out of
[00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:04.670]  the darkness, to the stars, and beyond.
[00:21:04.670 --> 00:21:18.390]  All right, we have attorney Tom Renz, who's the real deal. About half the whistleblowers
[00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:27.430]  that have blown wide open the game of function and the criminal projects went through Renz
[00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:33.350]  and he is a man of action. He now has the witnesses, he has the recordings, he has the
[00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:40.550]  documents of what we can see happening. Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, I'm getting chills
[00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:52.670]  right now, this is so horrible. The UK, Canada, the US took men, women, and children, and
[00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:58.470]  the computers would tell them who to hit, and they would take them to special floors
[00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:06.270]  at 130 plus hospitals in the US alone, kill floors is what they're called, and they would
[00:22:06.270 --> 00:22:11.390]  then put them on ventilators even when they didn't need it, in almost every case, and
[00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:15.670]  put them on enough drugs to kill them.
[00:22:15.670 --> 00:22:19.710]  We even have, right before they released COVID, the massive stockpiling in these different
[00:22:19.710 --> 00:22:25.470]  countries and news articles about it, of the drugs to do the killing.
[00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:32.950]  Now, when I say the Southern Poverty Law Center and the ADL and the leftists and antifa are
[00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:37.910]  just the front of these groups, saying the number one threat is white supremacy, not
[00:22:37.910 --> 00:22:42.790]  big pharma and the mad scientists of the new world order, they are just the front groups
[00:22:42.790 --> 00:22:44.550]  for this.
[00:22:44.550 --> 00:22:52.270]  And the ideology at the top of this is a eugenics-based, transhumanist, mad scientist cult wanting
[00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:59.190]  to accelerate the population so the rulers of the planet can enjoy the fruits of the
[00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:02.790]  earth without us being, quote, on their land.
[00:23:02.790 --> 00:23:04.230]  So this is beyond.
[00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:10.470]  a Hitlerian system.
[00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:13.470]  This would make Hitler blush.
[00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:20.470]  We'll be covering that with Tom Renz and the bombshell whistleblower,
[00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:23.470]  audio documents and more next hour.
[00:23:23.470 --> 00:23:30.470]  Then we have another special guest joining us in the third hour.
[00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:34.470]  And then Drew Hernandez is in the fourth hour,
[00:23:34.470 --> 00:23:37.470]  Stu Peters in the third hour.
[00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:42.470]  But when we talk about this, I want it to sink in to everybody.
[00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:45.470]  They're not just chemically and surgically castrating
[00:23:45.470 --> 00:23:47.470]  and sterilizing our boys and girls.
[00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.470]  They're not just shipping in fentanyl,
[00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:51.470]  the number one cause of death below the age of 45.
[00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:54.470]  They're not just dissolving the borders and massive human trafficking.
[00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:57.470]  They're not just raping children on Epstein's Island.
[00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:01.470]  They're not just starting World War III with Russia.
[00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:05.470]  They have set the precedent through a global system
[00:24:05.470 --> 00:24:08.470]  with global QR codes and global world ID
[00:24:08.470 --> 00:24:11.470]  to bring in a new world currency to control all of our actions and movements.
[00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:16.470]  And they have already corrupted thousands of hospitals around the world
[00:24:16.470 --> 00:24:24.470]  to be part of a protocol and operation to bring in fake nurses and doctors.
[00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:30.470]  That's why they closed the hospitals, wouldn't let staff in to the other areas.
[00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:34.470]  They use the more high-tech modern hospitals where it's all badge controlled.
[00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:41.470]  They already set it up before COVID was released in 2019, a year before.
[00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.470]  They already drilled.
[00:24:43.470 --> 00:24:47.470]  And then they set the precedent as a beta test
[00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:56.470]  to conservatively kill around 500,000 people with this method worldwide,
[00:24:56.470 --> 00:25:00.470]  around half of those in the United States.
[00:25:00.470 --> 00:25:02.470]  We have all the documents, all the proof.
[00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:04.470]  We'll be covering it in the second hour.
[00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:06.470]  But just let that sink in.
[00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:11.470]  We have a government following a UN globalist, Bill Gates,
[00:25:11.470 --> 00:25:14.470]  Peter Daszak, Anthony Fauci operation.
[00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:23.470]  The original test was HIV and the drugs that actually killed the people like AZT.
[00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:28.470]  And they did the same thing with remdesivir this time that makes your organs turn off.
[00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:30.470]  They put you on a ventilator.
[00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.470]  When you first go to the doctor sick, they say, come back if you get sicker.
[00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:33.470]  They know you're going to get sicker.
[00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.470]  Then they put you on a ventilator.
[00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:40.470]  Then they give you a bunch of different serious drugs
[00:25:40.470 --> 00:25:44.470]  that are used in anesthesia and you die.
[00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:51.470]  They kill you with a above hospice level dose.
[00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:54.470]  And they did it to homeless people.
[00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:55.470]  They did it to old people.
[00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:57.470]  They did it to young people.
[00:25:57.470 --> 00:26:00.470]  They did it as a plan to see if they get away with it.
[00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:02.470]  And could they lock us in our houses?
[00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:06.470]  And would the police attack us and take us to jail if we left our houses?
[00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:10.470]  Could they then push a poison shot on us that all the studies show
[00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:13.470]  and what top scientists warned beforehand would happen?
[00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:15.470]  Massive cancer increase.
[00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:26.470]  New scientist reports cancer mystery as cases rise among younger people around the world.
[00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:28.470]  And we have the list of countries.
[00:26:28.470 --> 00:26:32.470]  It's all the countries that took the Moderna and Pfizer shots.
[00:26:32.470 --> 00:26:36.470]  The biggest two-year increase in history, massive.
[00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:39.470]  They said it's absolutely devastating.
[00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:47.470]  Cancer in young people is up multi-thousand percentage points.
[00:26:49.470 --> 00:26:52.470]  Starting to get the picture here?
[00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:55.470]  I mean, we talk about how they're killing us and they talk about how they want to depopulate us.
[00:26:55.470 --> 00:26:59.470]  They're doing it while there's this background noise of,
[00:26:59.470 --> 00:27:03.470]  oh, the white people are racist and, oh, the ADL, there's white supremacists everywhere.
[00:27:03.470 --> 00:27:10.470]  Meanwhile, we have a global big pharma system that has injected millions of people
[00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:16.470]  with a self-replicating spike protein that is cancerous and that is anti-fertility
[00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.470]  and that attacks your organs and your eyes and your heart and your brain.
[00:27:20.470 --> 00:27:23.470]  And the death is all around us.
[00:27:24.470 --> 00:27:28.470]  And life expectancy is plunging.
[00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:34.470]  And they created all these new mutated viruses by giving the so-called vaccine
[00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:40.470]  during the viral spread, which you never do because they know it causes mutations
[00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:43.470]  and survival of the fittest.
[00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:49.470]  And we are literally living in a holocaust.
[00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:55.470]  We are in the second great holocaust that makes what Hitler did
[00:27:56.470 --> 00:28:02.470]  look like an unorganized field trip of five-year-olds
[00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:06.470]  running around with a bunch of spasmodic grab-assing.
[00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:11.470]  And Hitler was the most organized murder operation the planet had ever seen to that point.
[00:28:11.470 --> 00:28:15.470]  Well, the new world order said, hold my beer.
[00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:21.470]  And so I want to say to La Raza and Mecha and the KKK and the ADL
[00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:25.470]  and all these different race-based groups, we're all going to be destroyed by this.
[00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:30.470]  And if you think anybody is going to be immune from the hell that's coming down
[00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:33.470]  and what the cutting off of the worldwide energy systems mean
[00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:38.470]  and the collapse of the third world, it's over, folks.
[00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:40.470]  We're already deep inside the killing.
[00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:45.470]  And the only way this turns around is if not just the good people stand up,
[00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:49.470]  but even people that have been serving evil, have that come-to-Jesus moment
[00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:52.470]  and just admit you are the bad guys.
[00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:57.470]  And you're going to kill us all, you fools.
[00:29:19.470 --> 00:29:22.470]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability
[00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:26.470]  is lack of real, pure iodine in the body
[00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:32.470]  as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:37.470]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007
[00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:42.470]  worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:44.470]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:48.470]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together
[00:29:48.470 --> 00:29:50.470]  that supercharges your body.
[00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:53.470]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:29:53.470 --> 00:29:56.470]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.

[00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.470]  This is Adam King, host of the Adam King Show,
[00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:05.470]  joined by the one and only Greg Reiss of the Reiss Report.
[00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:08.470]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:30:08.470 --> 00:30:11.470]  Click this QR code right above Greg Reiss.
[00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:17.470]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage, super male vitality, or what Greg has.
[00:30:17.470 --> 00:30:18.470]  What do you got there?
[00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:20.470]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice,
[00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:25.470]  get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter and get clean, healthy water
[00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.470]  whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:29.470]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:33.470]  the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:39.470]  Absolutely, and we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:42.470]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR,
[00:30:42.470 --> 00:30:44.470]  the real NPR of the base, right?

[00:31:04.470 --> 00:31:08.470]  and it's Turbo Force Plus. We made it even stronger.
[00:31:08.470 --> 00:31:12.470]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere.
[00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:19.470]  Turbo Force is back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:25.470]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.470]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:31.470]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things
[00:31:31.470 --> 00:31:35.470]  and amino acids that turbocharge everything
[00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:39.470]  and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you name it.
[00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:41.470]  It is the super fuel.
[00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:44.470]  RainForce Plus is great. RainForce Alt is great.
[00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:46.470]  They're two different nootropics. They go good with this.
[00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:48.470]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:50.470]  This is the boss.
[00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:55.470]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.470]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:05.470]  In the early 1900s, certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic
[00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:07.470]  fluoride gases into the atmosphere.
[00:32:07.470 --> 00:32:10.470]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:15.470]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers
[00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:18.470]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid,
[00:32:18.470 --> 00:32:21.470]  still highly toxic but containable.
[00:32:21.470 --> 00:32:24.470]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison
[00:32:24.470 --> 00:32:27.470]  and there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[00:32:27.470 --> 00:32:32.470]  Lucky for them, one of their major stockholders was also the Secretary of the Treasury,
[00:32:32.470 --> 00:32:35.470]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:40.470]  And by 1950, the U.S. government began buying this toxic, untreated,
[00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:44.470]  industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:49.470]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:53.470]  With the Alexa Pure Pro, you can have clean drinking water
[00:32:53.470 --> 00:32:55.470]  and a remedy to this madness.
[00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:59.470]  Available now at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:33:00.470 --> 00:33:05.470]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[00:33:05.470 --> 00:33:07.470]  it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.470]  We will destroy ourselves soon.
[00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.470]  And we cannot control evil.
[00:33:25.470 --> 00:33:27.470]  We're following the same pattern.
[00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:29.470]  It's taking place over and over again.
[00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:34.470]  This time we've got weapons that will destroy the entire face of the Earth.
[00:33:36.470 --> 00:33:38.470]  There's not much time to repent.
[00:33:39.470 --> 00:33:42.470]  There's not much time to face evil and admit it's real,
[00:33:42.470 --> 00:33:44.470]  and then do something about it.
[00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:59.470]  We will destroy ourselves soon.
[00:34:27.470 --> 00:34:29.470]  Oh, my God.
[00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:31.470]  I'm back.
[00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:34.470]  I'm home.
[00:34:35.470 --> 00:34:37.470]  All the time it was.
[00:34:39.470 --> 00:34:42.470]  We finally, really did it.
[00:34:43.470 --> 00:34:45.470]  You maniacs!
[00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:48.470]  You blew it up!
[00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:51.470]  Oh, damn you!
[00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:56.470]  God damn you all to hell!
[00:34:58.470 --> 00:35:01.470]  The Rod Serling classic, Planet of the Apes.
[00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:03.470]  He wasn't on a foreign planet.
[00:35:03.470 --> 00:35:06.470]  He was back on Earth thousands of years later after a nuclear war
[00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:09.470]  and only figured it out when he found the melted Statue of Liberty.
[00:35:18.470 --> 00:35:23.470]  Oh, the Bilderberg Group's real, says CBS News.
[00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:25.470]  Real, says CBS News.
[00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:29.470]  And they're going to save us from world government.
[00:35:31.470 --> 00:35:34.470]  They'll protect us from the AI they've rolled out against us.
[00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:38.470]  And don't criticize it.
[00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:43.470]  Or the ADL will break in your house or business and plant stuff on you,
[00:35:43.470 --> 00:35:45.470]  and then the FBI will raid you.
[00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:51.470]  The ADL will infiltrate employees into your business.
[00:35:53.470 --> 00:35:55.470]  Southern Poverty Law Center will do it.
[00:35:57.470 --> 00:36:00.470]  Does anybody feel safe rolling over to these people?
[00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:05.470]  No, every cell in my body, my instincts, my soul says,
[00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:09.470]  we have got to admit we have a global corporate takeover, a bad scientist,
[00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:12.470]  and we have to peacefully dismantle it.
[00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:17.470]  But we cannot play their games because these eugenicists, super Nazis,
[00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.470]  have hired leftist groups like the ADL to be their front.
[00:36:22.470 --> 00:36:25.470]  We have to transcend that and not become Kanye West,
[00:36:26.470 --> 00:36:31.470]  who I'm not attacking, but obviously has been sucked into the paradigm.
[00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:35.470]  Or who knows, because of his tax issues, he might be working for them.
[00:36:35.470 --> 00:36:38.470]  They might be threatening to put him in jail if he doesn't go around
[00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:41.470]  and try to set people up like he did that day,
[00:36:41.470 --> 00:36:43.470]  sitting around here in the chair next to me.
[00:36:43.470 --> 00:36:45.470]  But I saw that coming a mile away.
[00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:49.470]  My wife's got good sixth sense.
[00:36:49.470 --> 00:36:51.470]  She said, don't do the interview. It's a setup.
[00:36:52.470 --> 00:36:54.470]  And I said, I know it's a setup, sweetheart,
[00:36:55.470 --> 00:36:57.470]  but I'm not going to fall into their trap.
[00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:03.470]  I love everybody.
[00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:08.470]  I love the Muslims. I love the Jews. I love the Christians.
[00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:13.470]  I love the animists. I love the agnostics and the atheists.
[00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:17.470]  I really don't want to see us all destroyed together.
[00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:21.470]  I really don't want to see this planetary collapse and hell world.
[00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:27.470]  But no matter what they say or do or how they persecute us,
[00:37:28.470 --> 00:37:30.470]  we have to tell the truth and never stop.
[00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:37.470]  And I can try to reach out to those that serve evil, and I do,
[00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:40.470]  because that's the right thing.
[00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:45.470]  But it really does come down to those of us of every race, color, and creed
[00:37:46.470 --> 00:37:49.470]  who know this is wrong and know this is dangerous.
[00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:53.470]  And those of us that are smart enough to see through it have to somehow reach out
[00:37:54.470 --> 00:37:59.470]  to the general public and inform them of the grave danger we're all in.
[00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:03.470]  It's called a corruption.
[00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:09.470]  You don't just pay somebody off once because you want that one thing
[00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:12.470]  for them to do with a bribe.
[00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:17.470]  By them taking the bribe, they are now entering the world of corruption,
[00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:22.470]  and they are becoming slaves of those they took the bribe from.
[00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:28.470]  And when they, through protocols and the bioethics boards,
[00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:33.470]  set up a system to sterilize millions of children,
[00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:38.470]  set up a system to euthanize hundreds of thousands and now millions of people,
[00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:45.470]  that level of institutional organized crime is so evil
[00:38:46.470 --> 00:38:53.470]  that institutions will then cover it up and defend it,
[00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:57.470]  even though they weren't part of the crime itself,
[00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.470]  but by covering it up because it would bring down the system,
[00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:04.470]  it now makes the system more corrupt and evil.
[00:39:05.470 --> 00:39:08.470]  Remember there was a National Post article 10 years ago or so,
[00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:13.470]  and it was written by the editorial board, that's the biggest paper in Canada,
[00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:16.470]  and they said, look, our top professors have looked at 9-11,
[00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:21.470]  and clearly it was an inside job, Building 7 was blown up,
[00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:24.470]  and we're not saying there aren't Muslim extremists,
[00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:28.470]  but they went on to say that clearly they were aided and this was allowed to happen,
[00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:30.470]  and there was other projects piggybacked on.
[00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:34.470]  They said, this will bring down the entire liberal system,
[00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:40.470]  that's the whole world system, bigger than Republican or Democrat,
[00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:43.470]  if we let this come out, and again, they think we're animals,
[00:39:44.470 --> 00:39:49.470]  so they're writing in the editorial pages of the editorial board of the paper,
[00:39:50.470 --> 00:39:53.470]  that yeah, we know it's an inside job, but we have to suppress it,
[00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:58.470]  because 9-11 treatment got so powerful the first 10 years after,
[00:39:59.470 --> 00:40:03.470]  that it was unseeing the whole system, and see, it's the same methodology.
[00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:08.470]  When you get people that I personally know,
[00:40:11.470 --> 00:40:14.470]  whose mother or father or brother or sister,
[00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:18.470]  would go in with a bad cough and trouble breathing,
[00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:22.470]  and they wouldn't give them drugs, they'd say, just go home, take some aspirin,
[00:40:23.470 --> 00:40:25.470]  and when they couldn't breathe, they'd come back and put them on a ventilator,
[00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:27.470]  and there was the same thing in every western country,
[00:40:28.470 --> 00:40:32.470]  on average, the equivalent of $53,000 to put somebody on a ventilator,
[00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:34.470]  another $12,000 if they died.
[00:40:35.470 --> 00:40:39.470]  So the hospital systems were getting more than $60,000.
[00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:44.470]  No matter where you are, it was the same in the UK, same in Australia, same here.
[00:40:45.470 --> 00:40:48.470]  Same program, same deal, oh, you can't see your loved one,
[00:40:49.470 --> 00:40:51.470]  well, they weren't letting the nurses and doctors that normally work there,
[00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:54.470]  they were telling them, oh, we're not doing regular care right now
[00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:57.470]  at these key hospitals, remember? Oh, the hospital's closed.
[00:40:58.470 --> 00:41:00.470]  You'd go there, no cars are there, but they'd show you,
[00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:04.470]  oh, it's so busy, there's people on hazmat crews, don't come to the hospital,
[00:41:05.470 --> 00:41:06.470]  we can't do that elective surgery.
[00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:09.470]  We can't even see people that had heart attacks.
[00:41:10.470 --> 00:41:11.470]  Remember, they had messages, you know, COVID's so bad,
[00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:15.470]  the hospitals are so overwhelmed, orders went out all over the world,
[00:41:16.470 --> 00:41:18.470]  do not resuscitate someone with a heart attack to an ambulance,
[00:41:19.470 --> 00:41:22.470]  because we don't have the staff, because they sent them home
[00:41:23.470 --> 00:41:27.470]  at most of the major big hospitals for the first six months, remember this?
[00:41:28.470 --> 00:41:30.470]  And said, and you can't see your loved ones either,
[00:41:31.470 --> 00:41:34.470]  because they were murdering people and setting that precedent
[00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:38.470]  to turn hospitals into pure, straight up death camps.
[00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:41.470]  We'll document it all next hour.
[00:41:42.470 --> 00:41:45.470]  Now, I'm going to ask everybody there, I don't care if you're an idiot KKK member
[00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:50.470]  or an evil, villainous ADL commando, come on,
[00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:53.470]  they did the same thing somewhere else, too.
[00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:59.470]  Israel had the highest rate of murdering people after the UK.
[00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:07.470]  Oh, the Jews run it all, according to the yeas of the world,
[00:42:08.470 --> 00:42:11.470]  but then why was Israel the most clamped down on,
[00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:14.470]  other than maybe Singapore?
[00:42:15.470 --> 00:42:18.470]  And yet, y'all who said six months ago, I can play the club.
[00:42:19.470 --> 00:42:21.470]  Yet, y'all who said, hey, Israel's a terrible country,
[00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:23.470]  yet, y'all who said, hey, Israel's a testing bed now,
[00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:26.470]  we're going to test all the drugs on our people, we all have a medical ID,
[00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:28.470]  we're going to find out what works, what hurts people, what helps them.
[00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:31.470]  He was so brazen in a Jordan Peterson interview.
[00:42:36.470 --> 00:42:38.470]  And it's just like, why?
[00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:40.470]  It's about power.
[00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:44.470]  And it's not just, go be a pedophile to get the club.
[00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.470]  These hospitals, people that did this, are now in the murder club.
[00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:49.470]  They now join the gang.
[00:42:49.470 --> 00:42:50.470]  They now killed a bunch of people.
[00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:52.470]  And got paid to do it.
[00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:54.470]  This is an operation.
[00:42:55.470 --> 00:42:56.470]  We'll be right back.
[00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:23.470]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements,
[00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:25.470]  so your body can't absorb it.
[00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:29.470]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[00:43:30.470 --> 00:43:33.470]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there
[00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:36.470]  that actually has this type of full effect.
[00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:39.470]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:41.470]  It's very hard to produce.
[00:43:42.470 --> 00:43:43.470]  And it's finally back in stock.

[00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:08.470]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed
[00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:10.470]  during their major takeover
[00:44:11.470 --> 00:44:12.470]  is because of you.
[00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:14.470]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.

[00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:57.470]  Thank you so much for your support.
[00:44:58.470 --> 00:44:59.470]  Please take action.
[00:45:12.470 --> 00:45:13.470]  The fish oil is it.
[00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:15.470]  The fish oil is better than it,
[00:45:16.470 --> 00:45:17.470]  and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[00:45:18.470 --> 00:45:19.470]  Fish oil is liquid energy,
[00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:21.470]  brain, body, heart,
[00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:23.470]  the cleanest, the best out there.
[00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:25.470]  Krill oil is the best,
[00:45:26.470 --> 00:45:27.470]  and it'll give you the damn burps,
[00:45:28.470 --> 00:45:29.470]  and I'm just sorry.
[00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:31.470]  You want something like this,
[00:45:32.470 --> 00:45:33.470]  you don't get stuff for free.
[00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:35.470]  The krill is hallucinogenic.
[00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:37.470]  It's so good in my view.
[00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:39.470]  I'm not making a medical statement here,
[00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:41.470]  but let me tell you something.
[00:45:42.470 --> 00:45:43.470]  It's basically out of what fish oil is.
[00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:48.470]  So we don't make a big profit off of it,
[00:45:49.470 --> 00:45:50.470]  but you notice I just obsess
[00:45:51.470 --> 00:45:52.470]  because whatever the best is we've got,
[00:45:53.470 --> 00:45:54.470]  I just can't lie to you.
[00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:56.470]  I just can't do it.
[00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:58.470]  Infowarsstore.com
[00:45:59.470 --> 00:46:00.470]  Turbo Force is back,
[00:46:01.470 --> 00:46:02.470]  sold out eight months,
[00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:04.470]  and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:06.470]  We made it even stronger.
[00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:08.470]  The strongest long-term energy
[00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:10.470]  you're going to find anywhere.
[00:46:10.470 --> 00:46:11.470]  Turbo Force is back in stock
[00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:13.470]  at Infowarsstore.com
[00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:16.470]  or 888-253-3139.
[00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:20.470]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs
[00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:22.470]  that time-release over 10 hours.
[00:46:23.470 --> 00:46:24.470]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[00:46:25.470 --> 00:46:26.470]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals
[00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:28.470]  and a bunch of other key things
[00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:30.470]  and amino acids
[00:46:31.470 --> 00:46:32.470]  that turbocharge everything
[00:46:33.470 --> 00:46:34.470]  and are good for your heart, your brain,
[00:46:35.470 --> 00:46:36.470]  your liver, you name it.
[00:46:37.470 --> 00:46:39.470]  It is the super fuel
[00:46:40.470 --> 00:46:41.470]  Rainforce Plus is great.
[00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:43.470]  Rainforce Ultra is great.
[00:46:44.470 --> 00:46:45.470]  They're two different nootropics.
[00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:47.470]  They go good with this,
[00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:49.470]  but this is the King Kong.
[00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:51.470]  This is the boss.
[00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:53.470]  Turbo Force, back in stock,
[00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:55.470]  discounted, Infowarsstore.com.
[00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:57.470]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:47:08.070 --> 00:47:27.070]  From England to Morocco, from Israel to the United States, from Canada to New Zealand,
[00:47:27.070 --> 00:47:33.350]  through the biomedical complex, and under U.N. direction, itself given directives by
[00:47:33.350 --> 00:47:42.350]  Bill Gates' Combine, the Carnegie Endowment, the CIA, they openly cleared the hospitals,
[00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:46.350]  kicked out the regular staff at key facilities, and murdered people in each nation.
[00:47:46.350 --> 00:47:52.590]  It's all coming up next hour with the documents.
[00:47:52.590 --> 00:47:56.550]  Now I'm going to ask the FBI, I'm going to ask school teachers, I'm going to ask auto
[00:47:56.550 --> 00:48:01.990]  mechanics, I'm going to ask pastors, I'm going to ask the Southern Poverty Law Center,
[00:48:01.990 --> 00:48:07.030]  the ADL, the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, black people, white people, old people,
[00:48:07.030 --> 00:48:09.750]  gay people, straight people.
[00:48:09.750 --> 00:48:13.230]  You understand this is all real, okay?
[00:48:13.230 --> 00:48:16.430]  People ask why I don't have any fear.
[00:48:16.430 --> 00:48:19.830]  Because we are in an ocean of evil, and we're all going to be destroyed if we don't stop
[00:48:19.830 --> 00:48:24.170]  this.
[00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:25.590]  This is all on record.
[00:48:25.590 --> 00:48:27.310]  Earlier they told you the Bilderberg Group didn't exist.
[00:48:27.310 --> 00:48:31.070]  Now the Bilderberg Group's real, all over the news, they're going to save you.
[00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:35.830]  Let's put up the live show headline, please.
[00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:41.470]  Genocide emergency, 138 U.S. hospitals establish secret kill floors to murder COVID patients.
[00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:42.990]  Whistleblowers and documents now dropping.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:49.859]  And then look around you, everything else is happening.
[00:48:49.859 --> 00:48:54.060]  They take little girls' forearms and their muscles out of their thighs and build fake
[00:48:54.060 --> 00:48:57.779]  penises that almost always rot off and fall off in a few months.
[00:48:57.779 --> 00:49:01.660]  It looks like something out of Hellraiser.
[00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:05.100]  And I didn't know this, the crew showed me, I never got to it last week, the new Hellraiser
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:11.680]  is a transgender pinhead who actually transgenders people and rips the muscles out of their legs
[00:49:11.680 --> 00:49:14.520]  and arms and gives them fake penises.
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:21.160]  So they're telling you this is Hellraiser and they're doing it at the hospitals.
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:26.720]  How much of this are we going to take, ladies and gentlemen?
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:29.439]  And then when we criticize this, we're Nazis?
[00:49:30.690 --> 00:49:33.690]  Because we're anti-war? We're Nazis?
[00:49:35.690 --> 00:49:40.690]  At secretive annual meeting attended by world's elite, AI tops the agenda.
[00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:44.690]  Meeting secretly in Portugal, the annual meeting of the Bilderberg Group,
[00:49:44.690 --> 00:49:51.690]  is going to save us from the AI by all the world leaders, including the head of Pfizer and others,
[00:49:51.690 --> 00:49:57.690]  meeting with the World Economic Forum at the Bilderberg Group to carry this out.
[00:49:57.690 --> 00:50:01.690]  CBS News, CNBC, they're all reporting it.
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:12.540]  Now, I could spend five hours on this, and I'll probably shoot a special report for tomorrow
[00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:15.419]  just on these documents.
[00:50:15.419 --> 00:50:25.680]  But here's Elon Musk being attacked for saying George Soros hates humanity and wants to tear
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.680]  down civilization.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.859]  Well, that's what the New World Order is doing.
[00:50:29.859 --> 00:50:35.740]  So the ADL comes out and says he's helping Nazis.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:39.240]  So he comes out and says we shouldn't have an agenda and implode society like George
[00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:43.779]  Soros has for lawlessness, crime, stealing pension funds.
[00:50:43.779 --> 00:50:51.939]  And then the ADL goes, Jews, Jews, Jews, to make it about that, to hide behind that instead
[00:50:51.939 --> 00:50:57.859]  of having a discussion about what George Soros and others stand for.
[00:50:57.859 --> 00:51:00.140]  So this article is from Information Liberation.
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:01.140]  It's excellent.
[00:51:01.140 --> 00:51:02.140]  It's on Infowars.com.
[00:51:02.140 --> 00:51:06.200]  I'm going to have a link to it out of the live show feed so everybody can share it.
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.200]  But you need to go read it.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.200]  You need to go get it.
[00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:09.939]  You need to see the documents for yourself.
[00:51:09.939 --> 00:51:14.700]  Why the ADL and some of their scholars and others are very proud and want you to know
[00:51:14.700 --> 00:51:20.859]  since the 60s, they infiltrated populist, quote, right-wing groups and posed as racist
[00:51:20.859 --> 00:51:27.419]  at public events to discredit the groups, like the Patriot Front.
[00:51:27.419 --> 00:51:30.459]  And they broke into police stations and did so much more.
[00:51:30.459 --> 00:51:33.939]  And they want you to know that they're an intelligence agency working with the CIA and
[00:51:33.939 --> 00:51:34.939]  FBI.
[00:51:34.939 --> 00:51:41.020]  It's all in the article to stop Nazis from taking over and killing Jews.
[00:51:41.020 --> 00:51:46.500]  Oh, so you've got to take all our rights and spy on us and infiltrate us and say we're
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:52.859]  racist and lie about us so the tyrants don't take over.
[00:51:52.859 --> 00:51:56.140]  No, you're creating an atmosphere that'll destroy everybody.
[00:51:57.370 --> 00:52:02.370]  I'm not an apologist for Jews or anybody else, but they're individuals.
[00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:04.370]  Do you think the average Jew knows what's going on? No.
[00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:09.370]  They believe the hype that they're being persecuted, just like black people think whitey's out to get them.
[00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:11.370]  The globalists are out to get everybody.
[00:52:11.370 --> 00:52:16.370]  You need to go read this article and read these documents, but this is from them.
[00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:17.370]  And you go, why does that happen?
[00:52:17.370 --> 00:52:23.370]  Well, they said, well, now we're going to save you on the big stage with the FBI and CIA publicly,
[00:52:23.370 --> 00:52:25.370]  with TV ads saying, watch your neighbors.
[00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:27.370]  You can't trust white people.
[00:52:27.370 --> 00:52:29.370]  That's what Hitler did to the Jews.
[00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:38.370]  He ran newsreels and news articles and speeches that they were a secret evil group and that had to be exterminated.
[00:52:38.370 --> 00:52:41.370]  And now the ADL is saying they've got to come after all of us.
[00:52:41.370 --> 00:52:45.370]  And Sachiko Barron, what, two, three years ago at their annual meeting said,
[00:52:45.370 --> 00:52:51.370]  arrest Zuckerberg if he doesn't censor everybody and arrest Alex Jones.
[00:52:51.370 --> 00:52:54.370]  Wow, that's so friendly and nice of you.
[00:52:54.370 --> 00:52:56.370]  He wasn't being the cute little comedian there.
[00:52:56.370 --> 00:53:01.370]  He looked super evil because what he was saying was evil because he is an evil man.
[00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:05.370]  He is an intelligence operative on record.
[00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:10.370]  ADL ran an extensive multidimensional counterintelligence operation to destroy the John Birch Society.
[00:53:10.370 --> 00:53:15.370]  The John Birch Society was 100 percent dead on.
[00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:20.370]  They were shocked, their founder, by China being handed over to the communists.
[00:53:20.370 --> 00:53:27.370]  They investigated and found out that our government was funding authoritarianism worldwide.
[00:53:27.370 --> 00:53:32.370]  And they exposed the writings of the CFR and Bilderberg Group and other organizations
[00:53:32.370 --> 00:53:37.370]  to bring in world government to control both parties and other parties and other nations.
[00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:39.370]  And they were effectively educating people.
[00:53:39.370 --> 00:53:43.370]  And they said, get out of the Vietnam War in the mid-60s.
[00:53:44.370 --> 00:53:51.370]  So they got infiltrated, and here's the ADL, how they infiltrated them, how they demonized them,
[00:53:51.370 --> 00:53:54.370]  how they lied about them, how they committed crimes against them,
[00:53:54.370 --> 00:53:58.370]  and how they've done it ever since to everybody else and how good they are.
[00:53:58.370 --> 00:54:04.370]  Yeah, giving Arnold Schwarzenegger awards when he says he loves Hitler.
[00:54:04.370 --> 00:54:09.370]  Giving George Soros awards when he says the best time of his life was working for Hitler.
[00:54:09.370 --> 00:54:11.370]  You guys are evil.
[00:54:11.370 --> 00:54:12.370]  Evil.
[00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:14.370]  And I know you know you're evil.
[00:54:14.370 --> 00:54:15.370]  You like it.
[00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:16.370]  You think you're on the winning team.
[00:54:21.370 --> 00:54:26.370]  If you study history and if you look how things are going, you're going to kill us all.
[00:54:27.370 --> 00:54:32.370]  I have no desire to be at war with you guys, but let me just explain something to you.
[00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:37.370]  We have run the tables on you.
[00:54:38.370 --> 00:54:40.370]  Do I need to give you examples?
[00:54:41.370 --> 00:54:46.370]  Videos of Bill Gates get tens of millions of views and have hundreds of thousands of comments
[00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:54.370]  that you have to read for hours before you find one comment that's pro Bill Gates.
[00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:59.370]  It's the same thing for Soros.
[00:54:59.370 --> 00:55:01.370]  It's the same thing for all of you guys.
[00:55:05.370 --> 00:55:08.370]  You've lost, but you're going to keep escalating,
[00:55:08.370 --> 00:55:10.370]  and you're an attempt to keep control,
[00:55:10.370 --> 00:55:17.370]  and anybody can tell you that when a movable object comes into contact with an unstoppable force,
[00:55:17.370 --> 00:55:19.370]  there's a hydrogen explosion.
[00:55:19.850 --> 00:55:24.850]  There's a nuclear bomb.
[00:55:26.620 --> 00:55:31.779]  This is going to destroy everything.
[00:55:31.779 --> 00:55:33.700]  This is insane.
[00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:38.259]  And the government is openly organized to physically go to war with the American people
[00:55:38.259 --> 00:55:43.100]  and provide the false flags as a pretext.
[00:55:43.100 --> 00:55:50.140]  And then our civilization will descend into something that makes civil war sound like
[00:55:50.140 --> 00:55:53.140]  a walk in the park.
[00:55:53.140 --> 00:55:54.299]  I'll cover more of this.
[00:55:54.299 --> 00:55:56.299]  There's so much I haven't gotten to.
[00:55:56.299 --> 00:56:00.580]  Tom Renz is joining us with all the documents, the whistleblower information, the recordings,
[00:56:00.580 --> 00:56:01.580]  all of it.
[00:56:01.580 --> 00:56:03.220]  And I don't even need all this.
[00:56:03.220 --> 00:56:04.220]  You see it.
[00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:08.220]  You know what they did with the ventilators and the drugs and all of it, but it's so organized
[00:56:08.220 --> 00:56:09.700]  and it's so evil.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:15.359]  You know, why couldn't you see your family when they had COVID on a ventilator?
[00:56:15.359 --> 00:56:17.420]  Why would they send the rest of the staff home?
[00:56:17.420 --> 00:56:19.220]  Why was it the same policy worldwide?
[00:56:19.220 --> 00:56:21.940]  Because we're in the new world order now.
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:23.060]  I'm going to go to break.
[00:56:23.060 --> 00:56:26.339]  If you want to support the broadcast while at the same time getting great products, please

[00:57:17.020 --> 00:57:20.620]  the articles, share the videos, and keep uploading clips because you're really getting
[00:57:20.620 --> 00:57:21.620]  the word out.
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:23.140]  On the tail, you're the dog.
[00:57:23.140 --> 00:57:24.900]  Without you, the dog don't hunt.
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:31.180]  All right, folks, if we don't stop what they're doing, we're accomplices.
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.220]  I'll be really honest with you.
[00:57:33.220 --> 00:57:38.060]  I feel guilty that I haven't fought harder, but I promise you this, I've only begun to
[00:57:38.060 --> 00:57:39.060]  fight.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:41.140]  We'll be right back, my friends.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:46.540]  Hour number two, Tom Renz and the death camps that are now established inside hospitals.
[00:57:47.020 --> 00:57:54.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[00:57:54.620 --> 00:57:56.299]  in plain view.
[00:57:56.299 --> 00:57:59.060]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:03.339]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number
[00:58:03.339 --> 00:58:08.580]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:15.859]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:22.140]  the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[00:58:22.140 --> 00:58:27.819]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have
[00:58:27.819 --> 00:58:32.220]  cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:34.460]  Most iodine is bound to other elements, you don't absorb it.
[00:58:34.460 --> 00:58:39.980]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:42.259]  X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:42.259 --> 00:58:46.180]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[00:58:46.180 --> 00:58:50.420]  X3 back in stock, take action now, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:58:50.420 --> 00:58:55.900]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[00:58:55.900 --> 00:58:56.900]  supply.
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:59:01.819]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[00:59:01.819 --> 00:59:06.020]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[00:59:06.020 --> 00:59:08.859]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[00:59:08.859 --> 00:59:12.180]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[00:59:12.180 --> 00:59:17.420]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:23.339]  keep the soil rich with iodine, and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount
[00:59:23.339 --> 00:59:25.420]  of iodine every day.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:32.020]  Derived from ancient sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface, our InfoWars
[00:59:32.020 --> 00:59:36.900]  Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[00:59:36.940 --> 00:59:43.060]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated tri-iodine form.

[00:59:52.899 --> 00:59:57.299]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:04.100]  Tom Renz is coming up next segment with the biggest news ever.
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:10.500]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWar and say, I don't know what's going
[01:00:10.500 --> 01:00:15.380]  to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe you've got one!
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:22.819]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:34.100 --> 01:00:55.140]  As illustrated in RFK Jr.'s book, The Real Anthony Fauci, AIDS and AZT was Fauci's first
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:59.299]  official go at state-sponsored depopulation.
[01:00:59.299 --> 01:01:05.540]  Cecilia Farber writes that Peter Staley is the most iconic AIDS activist in the world,
[01:01:05.540 --> 01:01:09.299]  and that he was the guy who made AZT happen.
[01:01:09.299 --> 01:01:13.220]  The well-hyped media story goes something like this.
[01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:19.940]  Young gay activist Peter Staley came out as a homosexual in 1985 and inspired his older
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:26.140]  brother Jess Staley to join him in the fight against AIDS, which for them meant demanding
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:31.420]  more drugs, faster drugs, and cheaper drugs from Big Pharma.
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:38.380]  While posing as the voice of the downtrodden LGBTQ consumer, with the almighty support
[01:01:38.380 --> 01:01:44.220]  of the mainstream media behind them, the two brothers demanded that Big Pharma put speed
[01:01:44.220 --> 01:01:46.620]  ahead of safety and efficacy.
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:53.740]  This campaign directly resulted in the rapid FDA approval of AZT in 1989.
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:02:00.859]  Big profits were made, shortcuts were taken, and AZT killed thousands.
[01:02:01.899 --> 01:02:09.899]  Jess Staley worked for JPMorgan Chase and became a pioneer of woke LGBTQ banking.
[01:02:09.899 --> 01:02:18.140]  And after 30 years at JPMorgan and nine years as CEO of Barclays Bank in the UK, he resigned
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:24.540]  last year after an investigation into his ties with Jeffrey Epstein was launched as
[01:02:24.540 --> 01:02:27.500]  part of a US Virgin Islands lawsuit.
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:35.500]  According to the lawsuit, JPMorgan knowingly, negligently, and unlawfully provided and pulled
[01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:41.899]  the levers through which recruiters and victims were paid and was indispensable to the operation
[01:02:41.899 --> 01:02:45.020]  and concealment of the Epstein trafficking enterprise.
[01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:51.819]  Human trafficking was the principal business of the accounts Epstein maintained at JPMorgan.
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:58.220]  Jess Staley exchanged several hundreds of emails with Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:02:58.220 --> 01:03:01.740]  Some of them coded like the infamous Pizzagate emails.
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:06.060]  Staley to Epstein, say hi to Snow White for me.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:09.180]  Epstein to Staley, what character would you like next?
[01:03:09.899 --> 01:03:11.819]  Staley, beauty and the beast.
[01:03:12.779 --> 01:03:18.540]  Jess Staley is accused of forcibly and violently raping one of the victims and is said to have
[01:03:18.540 --> 01:03:23.259]  told her that Jeffrey Epstein authorized him to do whatever he wanted to her.
[01:03:24.299 --> 01:03:29.980]  Jess Staley was set to take over for Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who some believe will be
[01:03:29.980 --> 01:03:36.140]  charged with criminal conspiracy for his service to Jeffrey Epstein's child sex trafficking
[01:03:36.140 --> 01:03:36.859]  operations.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:43.259]  A New York federal judge threatened JPMorgan Chase with contempt of court if it does not
[01:03:43.259 --> 01:03:46.700]  speed up in producing evidence related to Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:53.180]  Jamie Dimon is scheduled to be questioned under oath later this month on his relationship
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:54.299]  with Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:03:54.940 --> 01:04:02.380]  Throwing gas on the fire, 19 Republican states just accused JPMorgan of closing bank accounts
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.940]  on political or religious grounds.
[01:04:04.940 --> 01:04:11.899]  In a letter to CEO Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Bank is accused of canceling major organizations
[01:04:11.899 --> 01:04:17.180]  checking accounts and then screening them with questions focused on religion and politics
[01:04:17.180 --> 01:04:18.540]  before reinstating them.
[01:04:19.259 --> 01:04:24.220]  The Federal Reserve Bank is not federal and it holds no reserves.
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:31.819]  It is a private bank owned by its member banks and overall owned by the same big banks deemed
[01:04:31.819 --> 01:04:35.100]  too big to fail like JPMorgan Chase.
[01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:41.580]  So when the CBDCs come to supposedly save the day, remember that these banks are run
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:44.299]  by child rapists and human traffickers.
[01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:47.420]  Reporting for InfoWars, this is Greg Reese.
[01:04:49.899 --> 01:04:53.180]  Too big to fail banks now connected to Jeffrey Epstein.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:54.380]  Child sex trafficking.
[01:04:54.380 --> 01:04:56.859]  We'll be right back with special guests.
[01:04:57.580 --> 01:04:59.899]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:02.620]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:05:02.620 --> 01:05:04.460]  It will change your life.
[01:05:05.020 --> 01:05:09.580]  The U.N. admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits that upwards of two billion people
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:13.819]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:05:13.819 --> 01:05:19.180]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:24.540]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:28.859]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:05:28.859 --> 01:05:35.020]  And InfoWarsStore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.060]  full effect.
[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:39.259]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[01:05:39.259 --> 01:05:42.620]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:45.180]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:47.580]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:05:47.580 --> 01:05:49.020]  You and your family need it.
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:51.259]  It's 25 percent off back in stock.
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:56.700]  X3, try iodine exclusively at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.740]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[01:06:21.259 --> 01:06:47.500]  All across the western world, hospitals are paid the equivalent of $53,000 to secretly
[01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:51.340]  lock people up, put them on ventilators, and then give them a cocktail of drugs to
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:55.500]  kill them while the families were left outside.
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:06:58.540]  Many of the hospitals where they did this were cleared out of the regular medical staff.
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:03.020]  And then many individuals posing as doctors and nurses carried out the killings.
[01:07:03.740 --> 01:07:06.940]  Well, I've been interviewing him for over two years and I thought he was credible
[01:07:06.940 --> 01:07:08.940]  at the start, but I know he's completely credible now.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:14.220]  So many of the top whistleblowers from the DOD, the vice president of the EcoHealth Alliance,
[01:07:14.220 --> 01:07:17.340]  all of them went through Tom Renz, attorney.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:22.299]  He's a lead lawyer in several major cases brought to Ohio, New Mexico, Maine, and nationally
[01:07:22.299 --> 01:07:28.380]  against the CDC, DHHS, and Fauci regarding force vaccine mandates, big Texas ship, these
[01:07:28.380 --> 01:07:36.779]  COVID-19 lockdowns, mask mandates, business closures, false PCR test data, fraudulent
[01:07:36.779 --> 01:07:37.819]  death numbers, and more.
[01:07:39.020 --> 01:07:42.380]  And he works with a lot of doctors and scientists around the world.
[01:07:42.380 --> 01:07:45.259]  Renz, R-E-N-Z-law.com.
[01:07:45.819 --> 01:07:55.180]  Now, in the enemy's army, in the enemy's armor, this is a lot bigger than the hundreds
[01:07:55.180 --> 01:07:58.859]  of thousands of people they killed here and hundreds of thousands more around the Western
[01:07:58.859 --> 01:07:59.180]  world.
[01:07:59.980 --> 01:08:05.259]  It's about setting the precedent to be able to carry out larger scale operations like
[01:08:05.259 --> 01:08:05.899]  this in the future.
[01:08:05.899 --> 01:08:06.940]  This is eugenics.
[01:08:06.940 --> 01:08:08.220]  This is euthanasia.
[01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:09.180]  This is depopulation.
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.819]  You see Canada saying, we're going to make people commit suicide now.
[01:08:12.299 --> 01:08:15.660]  We're going to kill mentally ill people who are wards of the state, and the ward says,
[01:08:15.660 --> 01:08:16.540]  I'm going to kill you.
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:18.860]  We're going to kill children who are just depressed.
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:20.139]  We're going to sterilize your children.
[01:08:20.139 --> 01:08:20.780]  It's happening here.
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:24.380]  This is the weaponization of the medical system against us.
[01:08:24.380 --> 01:08:30.380]  And key hospitals, 139, I said 138 from memory, around the country, from the whistleblower
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:33.260]  information and the audio and the documents, carried this out.
[01:08:33.260 --> 01:08:35.660]  More modern hospitals, highly controlled.
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:38.460]  Remember, they would also do the PR stunts that were documented all over the country
[01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:39.180]  and all over the world.
[01:08:39.180 --> 01:08:40.700]  But they'd say, oh, look, it's overwhelming.
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:41.580]  Lines, hazmat.
[01:08:41.580 --> 01:08:42.540]  Don't come to the hospital.
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:44.460]  Can't do your regular surgery.
[01:08:44.460 --> 01:08:45.260]  You got a heart attack.
[01:08:45.260 --> 01:08:45.900]  Don't come here.
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:52.059]  But they'd sent most of the staff home and brought in key people to carry out this beta
[01:08:52.059 --> 01:08:54.220]  test for what they had done.
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:55.820]  Now, the great Dr.
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:59.580]  Jane Ruby, who we need to get back on the show, had Tom Renz on a few days ago.
[01:08:59.580 --> 01:09:05.900]  It's gone viral, breaking whistleblower, pharmacist, tape confirms hospital murders are
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:10.380]  intentional, using morphine overdoses to hasten deaths in COVID patients.
[01:09:10.380 --> 01:09:11.100]  But it gets worse.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:13.180]  Remember what happened in the UK.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:15.980]  They got a stockpile.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.500]  Of a drug that's used.
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:23.500]  To put people under an anesthesia.
[01:09:24.460 --> 01:09:28.860]  And they would kill them with that, knowing that if you give somebody even a small amount
[01:09:28.860 --> 01:09:29.900]  of this, they can't breathe.
[01:09:30.540 --> 01:09:31.820]  Number of prescriptions for the drug.
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:36.059]  Modasa plan doubled during height of the pandemic.
[01:09:36.059 --> 01:09:37.500]  And right before the pandemic started.
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:41.340]  The UK government ordered the biggest stockpile ever of it.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.620]  And it goes on from there.
[01:09:44.620 --> 01:09:50.620]  FDA reports shortage of sedation drug used for putting COVID-19 patients on ventilators,
[01:09:50.620 --> 01:09:51.900]  which also means you can't.
[01:09:52.860 --> 01:09:55.580]  Breathe, even though you're on a ventilator, it shuts the lungs down.
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:59.180]  They gave me rendezvous that shuts down the kidneys and other parts of the body.
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:04.300]  Modasa plan was used to end the lives of thousands.
[01:10:05.019 --> 01:10:07.900]  Who were told have died of COVID-19.
[01:10:07.900 --> 01:10:10.860]  And the NHS document proves staff were ordered to do it.
[01:10:11.050 --> 01:10:19.570]  Now, if they get away with this crime, they can get away with anything.
[01:10:19.570 --> 01:10:23.850]  And Tom Renz joins us, will also air part of the tape, he'll give us updates on where
[01:10:23.850 --> 01:10:24.850]  this is going.
[01:10:24.850 --> 01:10:29.450]  But Tom, I know this is hard work, and but I just see your tirelessness, I see you everywhere,
[01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:31.950]  we salute the work you're doing.
[01:10:31.950 --> 01:10:35.970]  And I'm just so proud to know you, obviously, we need to expose this because as I predicted
[01:10:35.970 --> 01:10:39.730]  a few months ago, when they ended the pandemic, I said the UN would later say we ended it
[01:10:39.730 --> 01:10:41.090]  because a new one's coming.
[01:10:41.090 --> 01:10:42.350]  They now announced that last week.
[01:10:42.350 --> 01:10:44.330]  So they're getting ready to hit us again.
[01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:46.370]  We've got to take this down.
[01:10:46.370 --> 01:10:50.690]  We've got to intellectually, culturally convict them, the core public opinion, so no one goes
[01:10:50.690 --> 01:10:51.690]  along with them.
[01:10:51.690 --> 01:10:55.450]  And we see Chelsea Clinton saying there's less trust in the big pharma.
[01:10:55.450 --> 01:11:00.650]  Now there was three years ago, exactly Obama came out and pines for old days when people
[01:11:00.650 --> 01:11:04.370]  believed the media, and they could control the common set of facts.
[01:11:04.570 --> 01:11:07.170]  The truth is, they killed a lot of us.
[01:11:07.170 --> 01:11:10.930]  But they really lost in their COVID attack, in that they wanted to keep the lockdowns
[01:11:10.930 --> 01:11:14.010]  going longer, wanted to set the precedent for the world medical ID.
[01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:16.130]  That has failed by and large.
[01:11:16.130 --> 01:11:18.970]  The new UN treaty to take sovereignty is in deep trouble.
[01:11:18.970 --> 01:11:20.650]  So we're in a fight for our lives.
[01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:21.650]  Tom Renz, we salute you.
[01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:22.650]  Thanks for being here.
[01:11:22.650 --> 01:11:23.650]  It's mutual.
[01:11:23.650 --> 01:11:27.810]  Alex, it's been an honor to get to know you over the last couple years and to stand with
[01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:29.170]  you pushing truth.
[01:11:29.170 --> 01:11:32.530]  You know, the thing about this is, is I was shocked.
[01:11:33.370 --> 01:11:37.090]  You know this, Alex, when I started fighting this, you know, I'm just some nobody from
[01:11:37.090 --> 01:11:38.090]  a little town.
[01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:43.130]  And so when I hear things, you know, I would hear Alex Jones, you know, that guy, he's
[01:11:43.130 --> 01:11:46.690]  on TV, you know, he's talking about how they suppress his information.
[01:11:46.690 --> 01:11:49.050]  I used to hear that and think, boy, I don't know about that.
[01:11:49.050 --> 01:11:50.410]  That seems ridiculous.
[01:11:50.410 --> 01:11:55.810]  Now, fast forward three years, three years of me getting my chops busted every day for
[01:11:55.810 --> 01:11:56.810]  telling truth.
[01:11:56.810 --> 01:11:59.490]  I mean, you know, I'm putting out paperwork that I got recordings.
[01:11:59.490 --> 01:12:01.330]  I've got cited government documents.
[01:12:01.330 --> 01:12:02.570]  I got all this stuff.
[01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:05.210]  And what they tell me is that it's fake news.
[01:12:05.210 --> 01:12:06.930]  Are you kidding me?
[01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:07.930]  It's absurd.
[01:12:07.930 --> 01:12:12.250]  So I got to tell you, Alex, I'm honored to stand with you and to get just a little bit
[01:12:12.250 --> 01:12:14.890]  of understanding of what you've been through for so many years.
[01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:16.930]  So I appreciate all that you do as well.
[01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:20.330]  Well, we're not as bad off as the folks they murdered on these ventilators and what they're
[01:12:20.330 --> 01:12:21.330]  planning to do next.
[01:12:21.330 --> 01:12:23.450]  So there's a lot going on with COVID.
[01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:27.090]  I want to get updates on all the other lawsuits and things in a moment, but let's drill into
[01:12:27.090 --> 01:12:28.090]  the ventilators.
[01:12:28.090 --> 01:12:29.450]  I mean, we know family couldn't visit.
[01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:31.050]  They kicked the rest of the staff out.
[01:12:31.050 --> 01:12:33.730]  Same policy worldwide, bounties to put people on ventilators.
[01:12:33.730 --> 01:12:34.730]  We know the drugs were killing them.
[01:12:34.730 --> 01:12:37.570]  They knew it said don't give it to someone on a ventilator, so they stockpiled it ahead
[01:12:37.570 --> 01:12:38.570]  of time.
[01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:40.850]  I mean, all that proves it was a conspiracy.
[01:12:40.850 --> 01:12:42.850]  We can convict any of them with just that evidence.
[01:12:42.850 --> 01:12:45.850]  But now you've got the big pharmacist groups, everybody.
[01:12:45.850 --> 01:12:49.290]  They know what's on the indications and they know what they've been told.
[01:12:49.290 --> 01:12:50.850]  Lay this out for us.
[01:12:50.850 --> 01:12:51.850]  Yeah.
[01:12:51.850 --> 01:12:54.330]  So let me start with this from the law, right?
[01:12:54.330 --> 01:12:58.210]  And I want people to understand how this was done and so that you don't think that this
[01:12:58.210 --> 01:12:59.890]  is an accident or a one off.
[01:12:59.890 --> 01:13:03.330]  I want you to understand the way the law worked on this.
[01:13:03.330 --> 01:13:06.530]  We legislated hospital murder factories, OK?
[01:13:06.530 --> 01:13:08.010]  So this came from our government.
[01:13:08.010 --> 01:13:13.050]  I don't think that the buffoons that voted for the laws actually knew what they were
[01:13:13.050 --> 01:13:14.050]  doing.
[01:13:14.050 --> 01:13:15.690]  I mean, we heard we got Nancy Pelosi.
[01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:16.690]  You got to pass.
[01:13:16.690 --> 01:13:17.690]  No, exactly.
[01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:18.930]  You get global policy pushed by the U.N.
[01:13:18.930 --> 01:13:20.570]  The government's just signed on to it.
[01:13:20.570 --> 01:13:22.090]  It's the people writing the policy.
[01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:23.090]  Sorry.
[01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:24.090]  Go ahead.
[01:13:24.090 --> 01:13:25.090]  Yeah.
[01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:26.090]  No, you're dead on, Alex.
[01:13:26.090 --> 01:13:29.570]  So the people that were pushing this, they were behind the scenes.
[01:13:29.570 --> 01:13:33.670]  The people that voted on it were just too dumb and lazy to read the bills.
[01:13:33.670 --> 01:13:36.290]  So here's what happens.
[01:13:36.290 --> 01:13:42.370]  We got and I'm going to I'm going to use the word law generally to include policy, regulation,
[01:13:42.370 --> 01:13:45.050]  guidance, all these sorts of things.
[01:13:45.050 --> 01:13:50.450]  We've got the law that shifted and National Center for Vital Statistics, the CDC, HHS,
[01:13:50.450 --> 01:13:55.610]  all these people, they say, listen, if you're coughing, if you've got any symptoms of COVID,
[01:13:56.130 --> 01:13:57.130]  we want you to call it COVID.
[01:13:57.130 --> 01:13:58.610]  If you've got it doesn't matter what it is.
[01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:03.010]  If it's COVID, if it could possibly be COVID, we want you to diagnose COVID.
[01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:06.130]  And if you diagnose it as COVID, that's fine.
[01:14:06.130 --> 01:14:08.290]  And you'll get a bonus if you don't die.
[01:14:08.290 --> 01:14:13.130]  And I'm sorry to interrupt, but just to back you up, remember, zero flu in all these countries
[01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:16.210]  for those years because they were calling flu that and killing them.
[01:14:16.210 --> 01:14:17.210]  Sorry.
[01:14:17.210 --> 01:14:18.210]  Go ahead.
[01:14:18.210 --> 01:14:19.210]  Yeah.
[01:14:19.210 --> 01:14:20.210]  Yeah.
[01:14:20.210 --> 01:14:21.210]  Well, you got it.
[01:14:21.210 --> 01:14:22.210]  You got an incentive, right?
[01:14:22.210 --> 01:14:23.210]  You got extra money to call it COVID.
[01:14:23.210 --> 01:14:26.130]  But you were going to get a call from the government saying, why are you not listing
[01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:27.130]  these people as COVID?
[01:14:27.130 --> 01:14:32.330]  They say, well, what are the symptoms and the symptoms for COVID and the flu were identical,
[01:14:32.330 --> 01:14:33.330]  by the way.
[01:14:33.330 --> 01:14:34.330]  They were indistinguishable.
[01:14:34.330 --> 01:14:38.690]  I've put the side by side up before they're indistinguishable.
[01:14:38.690 --> 01:14:44.530]  So you've got everything being diagnosed as COVID and you get a bonus if you diagnose it
[01:14:44.530 --> 01:14:49.650]  as COVID because we pass a law that says if you've got COVID, not only can you call it
[01:14:49.650 --> 01:14:54.050]  COVID regardless of what it is, but you get extra money for calling it COVID.
[01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:58.250]  Then we pass more laws and the laws, what they do is they make it so that once you
[01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:04.090]  have COVID, if you give someone the appropriate treatments, you get a whole bunch more money.
[01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:07.770]  Well, the appropriate treatments start out with things like remdesivir, which causes
[01:15:07.770 --> 01:15:12.290]  system failure and kidney failure and organ failure and all sorts of problems.
[01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:14.970]  Not in every person, but in enough of them.
[01:15:14.970 --> 01:15:18.650]  You throw in things like you mentioned, malazepam.
[01:15:18.650 --> 01:15:21.770]  Well, it suppresses your breathing.
[01:15:21.770 --> 01:15:23.330]  Your oxygen levels fall.
[01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:27.830]  So anybody that lost a loved one in the hospital, you can be assured of one thing.
[01:15:27.830 --> 01:15:32.510]  They were probably getting a sedative of some type and that sedative was suppressing
[01:15:32.510 --> 01:15:36.970]  their breathing, which means their oxygen levels and saturation inherently go down,
[01:15:36.970 --> 01:15:41.730]  which means then the hospital tells you that you need to go on a ventilator.
[01:15:41.730 --> 01:15:46.050]  Well they got a big bonus for using their remdesivir and these approved treatments and then they
[01:15:46.050 --> 01:15:48.690]  get another bonus once they get you on the ventilator.
[01:15:48.690 --> 01:15:52.050]  Well the approved treatments push you towards a ventilator.
[01:15:52.050 --> 01:15:53.810]  So then you're on a ventilator.
[01:15:53.810 --> 01:15:55.490]  Hospital gets another bonus.
[01:15:55.490 --> 01:16:00.730]  Then to top the whole thing off, once you die and they call you a COVID death, the hospital
[01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:02.350]  gets another bonus.
[01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:06.930]  So instead of incentivizing hospitals treating patients and getting them healthy, we incentivize
[01:16:06.930 --> 01:16:09.530]  hospitals murdering patients.
[01:16:09.530 --> 01:16:16.290]  On top of that, Alex, is if all that wasn't enough, we also passed laws that said if you're
[01:16:16.290 --> 01:16:24.410]  treating COVID, you can't get sued unless you can prove that you acted willfully against
[01:16:24.410 --> 01:16:26.230]  the patient's interests.
[01:16:26.230 --> 01:16:31.850]  What that means to a lawyer is this, I have to prove that that hospital meant to kill
[01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:36.770]  you to file a lawsuit on your COVID treatment.
[01:16:36.770 --> 01:16:41.050]  So you as a lawyer that are an expert on this, you see them premeditatedly setting
[01:16:41.050 --> 01:16:44.050]  it up to make it harder for them to get in trouble.
[01:16:44.050 --> 01:16:45.050]  Absolutely.
[01:16:45.050 --> 01:16:48.850]  Well, you got to understand, not only do you have to prove that.
[01:16:48.850 --> 01:16:54.650]  So in any instance, anytime you have to prove someone acts willfully, that is very difficult
[01:16:54.650 --> 01:16:55.650]  in court.
[01:16:55.650 --> 01:17:00.690]  Now when you combine that with the fact that they've incentivized everybody using the exact
[01:17:00.690 --> 01:17:05.210]  same treatment protocols, what that means is, is that not only do you have to prove
[01:17:05.210 --> 01:17:10.170]  that they acted in bad faith, but you have to prove that everybody acted in bad faith.
[01:17:10.170 --> 01:17:14.210]  Because at the end of the day, what they're going to do when I say, listen, these guys
[01:17:14.210 --> 01:17:15.210]  acted in bad faith.
[01:17:15.210 --> 01:17:16.210]  They knew they were killing people.
[01:17:16.210 --> 01:17:18.850]  They're going to say, no, this is what everybody did.
[01:17:18.850 --> 01:17:19.850]  You can't prove that.
[01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:20.850]  We just did what everybody did.
[01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:21.850]  Yeah, we're not bad.
[01:17:21.850 --> 01:17:24.090]  We're just following the global policy.
[01:17:24.090 --> 01:17:28.010]  Their defense is if everybody jumps off the bridge, I had to too.
[01:17:28.010 --> 01:17:32.750]  And so there ends up from a legal perspective, they essentially create immunity on a level
[01:17:32.750 --> 01:17:37.070]  that is almost impossible to pierce, almost.
[01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:44.190]  Now when we start looking at and analyzing this from the position of willfulness, well,
[01:17:44.190 --> 01:17:49.310]  we're getting to a point now, we're getting to a point now where I think we're just about
[01:17:49.310 --> 01:17:51.710]  able to show that.
[01:17:51.710 --> 01:17:56.510]  Because as statistics, as facts, as evidence is coming out, you know, it looks more and
[01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:57.510]  more like this is willful.
[01:17:57.510 --> 01:17:58.990]  These guys knew what they were doing.
[01:17:58.990 --> 01:17:59.990]  Sure.
[01:17:59.990 --> 01:18:00.990]  Well, of course it's willful.
[01:18:00.990 --> 01:18:01.990]  It's premeditated.
[01:18:02.230 --> 01:18:05.870]  We're not going to stand on that under international law, common law, common sense, just because
[01:18:05.870 --> 01:18:12.510]  they've been given immunity in some regulation, again, willful conspiracy, everything's overridden
[01:18:12.510 --> 01:18:13.510]  by that.
[01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:14.510]  Absolutely.
[01:18:14.510 --> 01:18:24.790]  Well, as an added bonus, in certain instances, RICO will take precedent over government immunity.
[01:18:24.790 --> 01:18:29.390]  So these crooks in the federal government that were pushing this, if we get to the right
[01:18:29.390 --> 01:18:32.950]  point, we've got the right evidence, we're going to actually be able to go after them
[01:18:32.950 --> 01:18:37.510]  as part of a RICO claim, because this was a corrupt enterprise, in my opinion.
[01:18:37.510 --> 01:18:40.390]  I don't think there's any question about it.
[01:18:40.390 --> 01:18:41.390]  We're getting closer.
[01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:44.710]  But you know, for the people who are impatient about this, and I understand why, because
[01:18:44.710 --> 01:18:48.630]  I normally, I got the phone calls, Alex, I can't tell you.
[01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:55.270]  I got every day for months on end, phone call after phone call of people telling me, listen,
[01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:59.310]  my loved one, my sister, my brother, my aunt, my mother, they're dying in the hospital.
[01:18:59.310 --> 01:19:03.910]  They tell us she's got three days to live, but they won't let us try ivermectin.
[01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:06.990]  They tell us there's nothing else they can do, and they aren't going to do anything,
[01:19:06.990 --> 01:19:07.990]  but they won't let us try hydroxychloroquine.
[01:19:07.990 --> 01:19:13.830]  I would open the phones up, and people were just begging, with loved ones dying, who were
[01:19:13.830 --> 01:19:14.830]  totally healthy.
[01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:17.590]  I remember we had the whistleblower nurse out of New York, where they would just grab
[01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:19.790]  homeless people and throw them in.
[01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:22.590]  They weren't even sick, they just murder them.
[01:19:22.590 --> 01:19:25.310]  Yeah, yeah, no question about it.
[01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:29.630]  You know, and there's a great image of how empty this was.
[01:19:29.630 --> 01:19:35.190]  The only time you actually saw sick patients was when they set it up for a photo op.
[01:19:35.190 --> 01:19:40.310]  You know, this was unbelievable what was occurring, and you know, meanwhile, you see these idiots
[01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:44.070]  that were in the medical profession doing this stuff at the time, and the thing is, is most
[01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:48.390]  of the idiots that you're showing right now actually thought they were doing good.
[01:19:48.390 --> 01:19:50.750]  See, they didn't bother to do their homework.
[01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:52.870]  What they did was they read the CDC guidance.
[01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:53.870]  They just sat there.
[01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:54.870]  Most of them got sent home.
[01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:57.430]  The others just put people on ventilators and took the money.
[01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:58.430]  Yeah.
[01:19:58.430 --> 01:20:00.790]  They're dancing while people are dying.
[01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:01.790]  Yep.
[01:20:01.790 --> 01:20:02.790]  They read the guidance.
[01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:04.270]  They listened to the administrators.
[01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:06.670]  Whatever the hospital says, that's, well, that must be true.
[01:20:06.670 --> 01:20:08.190]  And the media said they were all heroes.
[01:20:08.190 --> 01:20:09.190]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:09.190 --> 01:20:10.190]  Yeah.
[01:20:10.190 --> 01:20:11.190]  All right.
[01:20:11.190 --> 01:20:13.310]  We just, we just joined some stations that just joined us.
[01:20:13.310 --> 01:20:18.390]  Continue, Tom Renz, breaking that down for people, how this conspiracy worked, and what
[01:20:18.390 --> 01:20:21.190]  this new whistleblower information is, you have.
[01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:22.510]  Yeah.
[01:20:22.510 --> 01:20:26.870]  So, you know, we've been working on gathering the data because we have to show willfulness.
[01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:32.070]  Well, so I get a call from, from a wonderful lady and she doesn't really want to be public.
[01:20:32.070 --> 01:20:37.190]  I mean, her name's public because she's filed a lawsuit and it's public record, but she's
[01:20:37.190 --> 01:20:41.830]  asked me to speak for her publicly because she, she, first of all, she wants to make sure
[01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:44.750]  she's not saying anything that's going to damage her lawsuit.
[01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:52.470]  And second of all, she wants to make sure that she's not looking for fame or fortune.
[01:20:52.470 --> 01:20:54.870]  She just, she's a mom of five.
[01:20:54.870 --> 01:21:00.870]  She's got a PhD in pharmacy, Stanford educated, one of the, one of the most qualified pharmacists
[01:21:00.870 --> 01:21:01.870]  I've ever ran across.
[01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:07.510]  I mean, the woman is a brilliant pharmacist and her name is Adreni.
[01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:14.190]  And she is, she comes forward and she says, listen, I, you know, I'm a pharmacist.
[01:21:14.190 --> 01:21:17.750]  I'd worked in clinical trials with big pharmas and said another, I wanted to get back into
[01:21:17.750 --> 01:21:20.470]  patient care, went back into that.
[01:21:20.470 --> 01:21:25.070]  And while I was at the hospital working during COVID, you know, I was looking at the drugs
[01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:29.870]  they were using and I felt that their protocols created an opportunity to hasten death.
[01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:36.150]  Now, hasten death is a, it's a term that's used, but don't overthink it.
[01:21:36.150 --> 01:21:39.630]  If I shoot you in the head, I'm hastening your death, right?
[01:21:39.630 --> 01:21:42.510]  It's a polite way of saying killing someone.
[01:21:42.510 --> 01:21:47.030]  It doesn't matter how you hasten death, hastening death is still killing someone, right?
[01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:51.910]  So she says, you know, they wanted me to sign off on these protocols that I thought were
[01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:55.950]  going to hasten death or that had the potential to cause death as said another.
[01:21:55.950 --> 01:21:58.230]  I said, well, okay.
[01:21:58.230 --> 01:22:02.310]  She said, well, I applied for a religious exemption because I didn't think that was
[01:22:02.310 --> 01:22:06.550]  right and they ended up firing her and retaliating against her.
[01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:10.910]  So I want you to understand what I just said, Alex, in plain terms.
[01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:18.190]  You got a PhD, super high end, quality educated pharmacist, as credentialed as anybody on
[01:22:18.190 --> 01:22:26.550]  the planet in a hospital, says to the hospital, your policies could result in patients dying.
[01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:29.830]  Can I have an exemption from supporting these policies?
[01:22:29.830 --> 01:22:34.350]  And instead of the hospital saying, oh my God, they could, we need to change these policies
[01:22:34.350 --> 01:22:36.350]  or at least reevaluate them.
[01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:40.790]  Instead, the hospital fires her and retaliates.
[01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:42.590]  And won't give her a religious exemption.
[01:22:42.590 --> 01:22:47.630]  She was asking for a religious exemption from being complicit to murder.
[01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:50.470]  In my mind, that's how I view this.
[01:22:50.470 --> 01:22:56.630]  And I mean, what can I say about instead of the hospital saying, oh my gosh, we need to
[01:22:56.630 --> 01:22:57.630]  look at this.
[01:22:57.630 --> 01:22:58.630]  We need to evaluate.
[01:22:58.630 --> 01:22:59.630]  Is this right?
[01:22:59.630 --> 01:23:00.670]  Did this pharmacist find something?
[01:23:00.670 --> 01:23:01.990]  Did we not know?
[01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:07.750]  Instead, they triple down and they fire the pharmacist.
[01:23:07.750 --> 01:23:10.710]  Think of how absurd that is.
[01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:18.310]  So we've got a pharmacist, well, as an added bonus to all this, because I hear a lot of
[01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:21.670]  people tell me a lot of things, right?
[01:23:21.670 --> 01:23:26.470]  And I always have to, I mean, you know at this point, Alex, I quintuple verify everything
[01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:28.030]  times 10.
[01:23:28.030 --> 01:23:33.870]  Well, it turns out that Adreni not only said it, but she just so happened to record and
[01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:36.670]  document everything she did.
[01:23:36.670 --> 01:23:38.110]  So she had recordings.
[01:23:38.110 --> 01:23:39.230]  She has paperwork.
[01:23:39.230 --> 01:23:41.590]  She has all sorts of things.
[01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:47.870]  Now, amongst those recordings, there was a clip which I just released.
[01:23:47.870 --> 01:23:55.790]  And that clip is between her, remember the doctor or pharmacy, and a nurse who works
[01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:57.670]  in the hospital.
[01:23:57.670 --> 01:24:03.790]  And if you're going to play it, this would be the time because it's, it's shocking.
[01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:06.150]  Well, we'll set it up for us.
[01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:08.310]  Tell us what we're about to hear.
[01:24:08.390 --> 01:24:13.230]  What you're about to hear is Adreni, the pharmacist, talking to a nurse.
[01:24:13.230 --> 01:24:19.790]  And what they're talking about is, prior to this, Adreni had talked about how she'd been
[01:24:19.790 --> 01:24:25.030]  transferred and they transferred her position for speaking out against what they were doing
[01:24:25.030 --> 01:24:26.430]  as part of the process.
[01:24:26.430 --> 01:24:29.950]  They transferred her and they did everything they could to shut her up.
[01:24:29.950 --> 01:24:33.510]  And so she says, you know, they transfer you and it's politics.
[01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:37.750]  This nurse says, starts talking about her floor.
[01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:38.750]  Her floor.
[01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:40.350]  And she says, what are we, hospice care?
[01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:45.190]  And she says, you know, this doctor, he's, he's, he's killing patients.
[01:24:45.190 --> 01:24:47.710]  He's telling us to kill the patients.
[01:24:47.710 --> 01:24:51.470]  And she goes on to talk specifically, there you go.
[01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:54.110]  So we're killing the patient in the floor.
[01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:58.830]  Because what he's asking us to do, the other floors don't want to do it.
[01:24:58.830 --> 01:25:00.710]  The other floors don't want to do it.
[01:25:00.710 --> 01:25:01.710]  You're right.
[01:25:01.710 --> 01:25:05.750]  The other floors do not want to murder patients, shocking.
[01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:09.150]  And then they talk about the use of morphine that, you know, based on this conversation,
[01:25:09.150 --> 01:25:14.470]  it looks like the unnecessary and unwarranted use of morphine, which is what we saw.
[01:25:14.470 --> 01:25:19.110]  A lot of what happened, you know, remdesivir was absolutely poison in my mind.
[01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:22.710]  I think it's absolutely a horrible, horrible drug that should never have been anywhere
[01:25:22.710 --> 01:25:24.350]  near a human being.
[01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:27.990]  But one of the things that not many people are talking about, and this is your, your
[01:25:27.990 --> 01:25:33.270]  pro tip for any of the other attorneys that want to get into this, remdesivir is a tough
[01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:35.850]  one to fight in the courts.
[01:25:35.850 --> 01:25:42.470]  But if you look, you'll find the misuse of other drugs was very frequent.
[01:25:42.470 --> 01:25:48.350]  Not every case, but known drugs, morphine, uh, malazepam.
[01:25:48.350 --> 01:25:52.390]  All these, there was a big scandal in the UK that they admitted that they basically killed
[01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:53.390]  people with it.
[01:25:53.390 --> 01:25:55.310]  So, so let's go ahead and play this clip.
[01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:56.310]  Here it is.
[01:25:57.110 --> 01:26:00.830]  I said, okay, are we hospice floor?
[01:26:00.830 --> 01:26:01.830]  What's the deal?
[01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:08.630]  She said that Dr. Staple said this floor is going to be his patients.
[01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:11.630]  So I was like, hmm.
[01:26:11.630 --> 01:26:13.630]  So you're going to have to always do the...
[01:26:13.630 --> 01:26:20.630]  So we are, we're killing the patients, this floor, because what he's asking us, well,
[01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:22.630]  other floors don't want to do it.
[01:26:22.630 --> 01:26:23.630]  Yeah.
[01:26:23.630 --> 01:26:25.630]  I couldn't sleep that night.
[01:26:25.950 --> 01:26:29.950]  I just, and then when that nurse practitioner, when you got that mission to do the morphine
[01:26:29.950 --> 01:26:31.950]  and you're like, she doesn't need it.
[01:26:31.950 --> 01:26:34.950]  And I was just like, this is what I'm talking about.
[01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:35.950]  It's not right.
[01:26:35.950 --> 01:26:36.950]  She doesn't need it.
[01:26:36.950 --> 01:26:37.950]  They're okay.
[01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:38.950]  They're okay.
[01:26:38.950 --> 01:26:39.950]  If they're comfortable, they're comfortable.
[01:26:39.950 --> 01:26:40.950]  We can tell when they're in pain.
[01:26:40.950 --> 01:26:42.950]  We can tell when they're agitated.
[01:26:42.950 --> 01:26:44.950]  We can tell when they're whatever.
[01:26:44.950 --> 01:26:50.950]  That doesn't make that you keep giving them medications to knock them out.
[01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:52.950]  Because that's probably, that's what you're doing.
[01:26:53.270 --> 01:26:56.270]  I remember that day you were like, you got the other nurses to come in and I'm just like,
[01:26:56.270 --> 01:26:59.270]  I know, that's what they're doing.
[01:26:59.270 --> 01:27:03.270]  And the big thing I get told by all these top doctors is, especially with COVID, you
[01:27:03.270 --> 01:27:04.270]  got to get up and move around.
[01:27:04.270 --> 01:27:08.270]  But these drugs are known to put fluid in the lungs, make you give up, make you die.
[01:27:08.270 --> 01:27:09.270]  And so they prevent it.
[01:27:09.270 --> 01:27:13.270]  But notice, other floors of the hospital wouldn't do it.
[01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:16.270]  The special floors would, Tom.
[01:27:16.270 --> 01:27:17.270]  Yep.
[01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:18.270]  Yep.
[01:27:18.270 --> 01:27:22.270]  And I mean, that clip is monumental.
[01:27:22.590 --> 01:27:26.590]  I mean, this whole floor, how many people died on this floor?
[01:27:26.590 --> 01:27:27.590]  And what I'm hoping is...
[01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:31.590]  And that's a nurse practitioner, basically a doctor, agreeing with the PhD pharmacist,
[01:27:31.590 --> 01:27:34.590]  this is murder.
[01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:36.590]  I'm not sure if the speaker is a nurse practitioner.
[01:27:36.590 --> 01:27:38.590]  Well, they're talking about a nurse practitioner.
[01:27:38.590 --> 01:27:40.590]  They talk about another nurse practitioner.
[01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:43.590]  I believe the speaker on there is a nurse.
[01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:45.590]  But yeah, they're talking about murder.
[01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:47.590]  They're talking about murder.
[01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:52.910]  And when the pharmacist said, I think this is a possibility, instead of them listening,
[01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:54.910]  they retaliate.
[01:27:54.910 --> 01:27:56.910]  They retaliate.
[01:27:56.910 --> 01:28:01.910]  I mean, Alex, this is evidence of willfulness, right?
[01:28:01.910 --> 01:28:04.910]  Which means there is no immunity.
[01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:06.910]  There's no immunity for willful actions.
[01:28:06.910 --> 01:28:09.910]  And it looks like that's what's happening here.
[01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:16.910]  And what I would suggest is, and what I'm calling for, is I'm calling for the AG of Alabama
[01:28:17.230 --> 01:28:21.230]  along with the local law enforcement to start an investigation.
[01:28:21.230 --> 01:28:23.230]  There needs to be a criminal investigation.
[01:28:23.230 --> 01:28:26.230]  Was there murder committed in this hospital?
[01:28:26.230 --> 01:28:32.230]  And understand, hastening death, it doesn't matter when that happens.
[01:28:32.230 --> 01:28:34.230]  If you hasten death...
[01:28:34.230 --> 01:28:35.230]  It's murder.
[01:28:35.230 --> 01:28:37.230]  How do you distinguish between that and murder?
[01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:39.230]  To me, there's no difference.
[01:28:39.230 --> 01:28:43.230]  So we've got the lawsuit with my client, who's been trying to bring this forward,
[01:28:43.230 --> 01:28:46.230]  who tried to bring this to the hospital's attention.
[01:28:46.550 --> 01:28:48.550]  Stay there and time runs, because here's the key.
[01:28:48.550 --> 01:28:51.550]  Not just for the victims for justice, but they're going to do it again.
[01:28:51.550 --> 01:28:53.550]  We've got to expose them before they do it again.
[01:28:53.550 --> 01:28:55.550]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:28:58.300 --> 01:29:01.300]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:04.300]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:06.300]  It will change your life.
[01:29:06.300 --> 01:29:09.300]  The UN admits and the Lansing Medical Journal admits
[01:29:09.300 --> 01:29:12.300]  that upwards of 2 billion people have mental disabilities
[01:29:12.300 --> 01:29:14.300]  and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:29:14.300 --> 01:29:17.300]  The term they use is intellectual disability
[01:29:17.300 --> 01:29:19.300]  because of lack of iodine.
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:23.300]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:25.300]  so your body can't absorb it.
[01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:30.300]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:33.300]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:37.300]  that actually has this type of full effect.
[01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:40.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[01:29:40.300 --> 01:29:43.300]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[01:29:43.300 --> 01:29:46.300]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:29:46.300 --> 01:29:48.300]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.
[01:29:48.300 --> 01:29:50.300]  You and your family need it.
[01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:52.300]  It's 25% off, back in stock.
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:56.300]  X3, try iodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:29:56.300 --> 01:29:59.300]  Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[01:29:59.300 --> 01:30:02.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution,
[01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:05.300]  is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[01:30:05.300 --> 01:30:08.300]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:11.300]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website
[01:30:11.300 --> 01:30:15.300]  where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:18.300]  in the world is iodine deficiency.
[01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:22.300]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability
[01:30:22.300 --> 01:30:26.300]  is lack of real, pure iodine in the body
[01:30:26.300 --> 01:30:29.300]  as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide,
[01:30:29.300 --> 01:30:31.300]  chlorine, and so much more.
[01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:35.300]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study
[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:38.300]  in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:41.300]  because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[01:30:41.300 --> 01:30:44.300]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[01:30:44.300 --> 01:30:46.300]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine,
[01:30:46.300 --> 01:30:49.300]  together, it supercharges your body.
[01:30:49.300 --> 01:30:52.300]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:55.300]  It's been sold out for over 6 months for 25% off.
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:59.300]  X3, back in stock. Take action now. Infowarsstore.com.
[01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:03.300]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:05.300]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:31:05.300 --> 01:31:09.300]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:31:09.300 --> 01:31:11.300]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars,
[01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:14.300]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:17.300]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:20.300]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:22.300]  and the hard work they engage in every day,
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:26.300]  5, 6, 7 days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:31:26.300 --> 01:31:28.300]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew,
[01:31:28.300 --> 01:31:30.300]  I thank you for your past support.
[01:31:30.300 --> 01:31:34.300]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air
[01:31:34.300 --> 01:31:36.300]  if you do not support us.
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.300]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us,
[01:31:38.300 --> 01:31:40.300]  and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:43.300]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com
[01:31:43.300 --> 01:31:46.300]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[01:31:46.300 --> 01:31:48.300]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[01:31:48.300 --> 01:31:52.300]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:56.300]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com,
[01:31:56.300 --> 01:31:57.300]  our funding problems will be over.
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:59.300]  Please take action now.
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:02.300]  They decided to not perp walking, not put him in handcuffs,
[01:32:02.300 --> 01:32:05.300]  not do a mug shot because they knew that that would help Trump.
[01:32:05.300 --> 01:32:07.300]  Didn't they know this would backfire?
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:09.300]  We were waiting for the mug shot.
[01:32:09.300 --> 01:32:11.300]  We learned today they wouldn't have it, so we've made our own.
[01:32:11.300 --> 01:32:14.300]  And it says, Political Prisoner.
[01:32:14.300 --> 01:32:16.300]  With an image of President Trump.
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:18.300]  The shirt is being printed now in Texas.
[01:32:18.300 --> 01:32:21.300]  It will be shipping out to you in one week.
[01:32:21.300 --> 01:32:22.300]  Political Prisoner.
[01:32:22.300 --> 01:32:26.300]  With Trump on the front there in a mug shot.
[01:32:26.300 --> 01:32:27.300]  Jail background.
[01:32:27.300 --> 01:32:28.300]  It's a fundraiser shirt.
[01:32:28.300 --> 01:32:32.300]  It says Infowars.com on the back of the shirt.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:34.300]  We also have Alex Jones for President.
[01:32:34.300 --> 01:32:35.300]  No, I'm not running for President.
[01:32:35.300 --> 01:32:37.300]  It's a really nice navy blue, high quality shirt.
[01:32:37.300 --> 01:32:38.300]  Red, white, and blue.
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:39.300]  Alex Jones for President.
[01:32:40.300 --> 01:32:42.300]  It's a fun conversational piece.
[01:32:42.300 --> 01:32:43.300]  And a limited edition shirt.
[01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:45.300]  Great way to fund the operation.
[01:32:45.300 --> 01:32:53.300]  So get your Alex Jones for President and Trump mug shot shirts at Infowars.com
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:57.300]  or by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[01:32:59.300 --> 01:33:04.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[01:33:04.300 --> 01:33:06.300]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:25.790]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:25.790 --> 01:33:39.390]  Well, a true freedom fighter, heads above the rest, is Tom Renz, knocking it out of
[01:33:39.390 --> 01:33:43.670]  the park with just incredible dedication and hard work and research.
[01:33:43.670 --> 01:33:50.870]  I want to give a few examples of premeditation here that anybody can see, that are hiding
[01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:52.550]  in plain view.
[01:33:52.550 --> 01:33:56.510]  But this issue of liability is really key.
[01:33:56.510 --> 01:34:02.830]  We know it came out in Brazil because the documents leaked, that they wanted Bolsonaro,
[01:34:02.830 --> 01:34:06.550]  Pfizer and Moderna, and people say, well, Bolsonaro ran the country.
[01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:07.550]  He didn't.
[01:34:07.550 --> 01:34:09.730]  He didn't run the bureaucracies or the Congress.
[01:34:09.730 --> 01:34:18.070]  So they were trying to sign deals to sign over the national parks and the national treasury
[01:34:18.070 --> 01:34:20.350]  for liability for an unproven shot.
[01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:23.470]  But they bought off the other politicians, demanding it be done, and saying, you're going
[01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:25.470]  to murder us, Bolsonaro, if you don't.
[01:34:25.470 --> 01:34:27.870]  Well, he said, I'm not doing it.
[01:34:27.870 --> 01:34:32.670]  So now the UN is looking at war crime charges against him, and they've raided his house
[01:34:32.670 --> 01:34:39.950]  in Brazil, saying someone might have had a fake COVID card.
[01:34:39.950 --> 01:34:42.910]  So they're using this for control.
[01:34:42.910 --> 01:34:49.310]  But we know there's secret agreements with the UK, with Germany, with France, with Israel,
[01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:54.230]  with the US, with Canada, with Big Pharma, for liability protection.
[01:34:54.230 --> 01:34:56.430]  It's the same thing they did to the hospitals.
[01:34:56.430 --> 01:34:57.430]  All of it premeditated.
[01:34:57.430 --> 01:35:04.110]  And remember, we saw the pharmacists and everybody opening up the big white pieces of paper.
[01:35:04.110 --> 01:35:10.070]  Any other drug you buy, by law, that's not over the counter, has that fact sheet in it
[01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:11.110]  and everything about it on it.
[01:35:11.330 --> 01:35:17.050]  But when you open this up, it just said what the drug was and where it came from, and it
[01:35:17.050 --> 01:35:21.130]  was all white, because there was nothing there.
[01:35:21.130 --> 01:35:25.210]  Because you can't attack something if you don't even know what the ingredients are.
[01:35:25.210 --> 01:35:29.050]  Now think about that premeditation, and then think about this.
[01:35:29.050 --> 01:35:31.850]  We can put Reuters on screen in a moment.
[01:35:31.850 --> 01:35:38.250]  The first show or open it up for TV viewers, nothing there, totally blank.
[01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:45.090]  Or what happened a couple years ago, the quote, illegal aliens, the migrants, they didn't
[01:35:45.090 --> 01:35:46.490]  have to take the shot.
[01:35:46.490 --> 01:35:54.050]  And Reuters reported that the UN said, well, we don't have liability protection.
[01:35:54.050 --> 01:35:58.490]  We didn't sign on to Pfizer and Moderna's secret agreement.
[01:35:58.490 --> 01:36:00.650]  So we can't give you an experimental shot.
[01:36:00.650 --> 01:36:02.050]  See how that works?
[01:36:02.050 --> 01:36:03.730]  They've covered all their bases.
[01:36:03.730 --> 01:36:07.850]  But in covering the bases, they show the organized crime.
[01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:10.010]  They show the racketeering.
[01:36:10.010 --> 01:36:12.890]  Refugees lack COVID shots because drug makers throw lawsuits.
[01:36:12.890 --> 01:36:17.530]  Documents show, oh, but you got liability protection everywhere you did it in the countries,
[01:36:17.530 --> 01:36:21.010]  which were the Western wealthy countries you're trying to get rid of.
[01:36:21.010 --> 01:36:24.610]  Tom Rims, let's finish up here, because I want to get into other COVID issues with you
[01:36:24.610 --> 01:36:31.250]  on this huge ventilator story and this huge, these death floors and what they were doing.
[01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:34.809]  Because I agree with you, this is a real chink in the dragon's armor that could bring them
[01:36:34.809 --> 01:36:38.490]  down, especially as more witnesses come forward and say that, yeah, we didn't even follow
[01:36:38.490 --> 01:36:39.490]  the law.
[01:36:39.490 --> 01:36:40.490]  We didn't follow policy.
[01:36:40.490 --> 01:36:42.650]  It was handed down to us to do this.
[01:36:42.650 --> 01:36:44.570]  Yeah, no, we didn't.
[01:36:44.570 --> 01:36:48.650]  And I hope I hope before we're done, Alex, because this just triggered a thought in my
[01:36:48.650 --> 01:36:51.130]  mind when you showed that blank sheet.
[01:36:51.130 --> 01:36:56.050]  I would love to break some information about the mRNA that's in these vaccines before we
[01:36:56.050 --> 01:36:57.050]  get off of here.
[01:36:57.050 --> 01:37:03.370]  But these killing floors, I mean, it appears to me that this was not an uncommon thing.
[01:37:03.370 --> 01:37:07.650]  OK, so I can't prove I don't I don't personally.
[01:37:07.650 --> 01:37:10.930]  And I saw that you had some stuff on this, Alex, and I'm going to be really eager to
[01:37:10.930 --> 01:37:12.809]  look at it as soon as we get off air.
[01:37:12.809 --> 01:37:13.809]  I can't.
[01:37:13.809 --> 01:37:17.050]  I don't have the evidence to show that there was a killing floor in every hospital in
[01:37:17.050 --> 01:37:19.170]  the country, but it sure looks like it.
[01:37:19.170 --> 01:37:20.170]  No, no, no.
[01:37:20.170 --> 01:37:24.090]  I was saying I was saying at the special hospitals, we know they shut down multiple floors, kicked
[01:37:24.090 --> 01:37:25.090]  out the regular doctors.
[01:37:25.090 --> 01:37:26.090]  There were different variants.
[01:37:26.090 --> 01:37:29.769]  So when I say killing floor, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:37:29.769 --> 01:37:33.490]  And I'm interested to see because that might tie into our investigation because we're looking
[01:37:33.490 --> 01:37:36.050]  how widespread was this, right?
[01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:41.970]  It looks to us based on information that we have that this was not an uncommon thing.
[01:37:41.970 --> 01:37:44.970]  And you know, this was in an Ascension Hospital.
[01:37:44.970 --> 01:37:47.130]  Ascension is a huge network.
[01:37:47.130 --> 01:37:49.530]  Was it just this hospital or was it in their network?
[01:37:49.530 --> 01:37:52.650]  You know, did they have that same protocol everywhere?
[01:37:52.650 --> 01:37:56.010]  We're working through a lot of stuff on this to try and see how widespread this is.
[01:37:56.010 --> 01:37:59.650]  And we know from Australia to the U.K. to here, they put them on these drugs.
[01:37:59.650 --> 01:38:00.650]  They kicked everybody out.
[01:38:00.650 --> 01:38:02.450]  They had special floors where they did it.
[01:38:02.450 --> 01:38:07.370]  I've got a family member that works the V.A. in Omaha or it's my wife's family member.
[01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:08.570]  And it was the same thing there.
[01:38:08.570 --> 01:38:12.130]  They said they kicked everybody out of the hospital, had special floors, regular staff
[01:38:12.130 --> 01:38:13.130]  couldn't go there.
[01:38:13.130 --> 01:38:14.130]  This was done all over the place.
[01:38:14.130 --> 01:38:15.130]  Oh, yeah.
[01:38:15.130 --> 01:38:17.930]  Well, let me let me do this for you.
[01:38:17.930 --> 01:38:18.930]  So right.
[01:38:18.930 --> 01:38:23.690]  I'm an attorney and I always do the do this for your audience and everybody else.
[01:38:23.690 --> 01:38:28.010]  I was distinguished between what I can prove with court type evidence and what I believe.
[01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:32.650]  I'm going to tell you outright, based on on a ton of evidence that I have that I don't
[01:38:32.650 --> 01:38:38.850]  think quite raises it gets to the level of proof, but certainly strongly suggest to me
[01:38:38.850 --> 01:38:44.290]  this was I mean, anyone with common sense would say this is a very it was planned.
[01:38:44.290 --> 01:38:45.930]  It was happening all over.
[01:38:45.930 --> 01:38:46.930]  They were doing this everywhere.
[01:38:46.930 --> 01:38:49.670]  I mean, you got the exact same thing happened.
[01:38:49.670 --> 01:38:54.269]  You know, you know, Alex, when I was getting these thousands and thousands of calls and
[01:38:54.269 --> 01:38:59.150]  literally one of the hardest periods of my life to have person after person call me and
[01:38:59.150 --> 01:39:01.190]  die and die and die and die.
[01:39:01.190 --> 01:39:03.670]  And I couldn't save them all.
[01:39:03.670 --> 01:39:08.269]  When this was happening, you know, it got to the point where where someone had called
[01:39:08.269 --> 01:39:09.269]  me up on the phone.
[01:39:09.269 --> 01:39:10.269]  OK.
[01:39:10.269 --> 01:39:11.269]  How long have they been in the hospital?
[01:39:11.269 --> 01:39:12.269]  OK.
[01:39:12.269 --> 01:39:13.269]  Eight days.
[01:39:13.269 --> 01:39:14.550]  What are their kidney numbers?
[01:39:14.550 --> 01:39:15.550]  What is it?
[01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:16.550]  What is the respiration?
[01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:17.550]  Are they on the vent?
[01:39:17.550 --> 01:39:18.550]  How long have they been on that?
[01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:22.430]  And I could ask a series of questions and I could tell you and predict with 90 plus
[01:39:22.430 --> 01:39:27.030]  percent reliability, despite the fact that I'm not a doctor, how many days they had before
[01:39:27.030 --> 01:39:28.269]  they were dead.
[01:39:28.269 --> 01:39:34.590]  And that's all over the country, because the same murder protocol, the same factory death
[01:39:34.590 --> 01:39:37.390]  project was done everywhere in the country.
[01:39:37.390 --> 01:39:39.890]  These people, they followed the law.
[01:39:39.890 --> 01:39:41.690]  They followed the incentives.
[01:39:41.690 --> 01:39:42.830]  They followed the money.
[01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:44.350]  They followed the plan.
[01:39:44.350 --> 01:39:45.710]  And the plan was to kill people.
[01:39:45.710 --> 01:39:51.350]  We incentivized and still to this day, the laws have not been changed, by the way.
[01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:56.710]  We have laws on the book that incentivize not the recovery from covid, but the killing
[01:39:56.710 --> 01:39:58.110]  with covid.
[01:39:58.110 --> 01:40:02.490]  If you have covid and you die, the hospital gets more money.
[01:40:02.490 --> 01:40:06.309]  And instead of saying if you get if you get covid and the hospital cures you, you get
[01:40:06.309 --> 01:40:07.309]  more money.
[01:40:07.309 --> 01:40:09.990]  They needed to drive up death numbers to push vaccines.
[01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:12.670]  In my opinion, that's what I think this was all about.
[01:40:12.670 --> 01:40:16.390]  I think it's you know, anyone with common sense can see this.
[01:40:16.390 --> 01:40:19.630]  And I'm just working on getting it where I've got enough evidence to make it work in a court
[01:40:19.630 --> 01:40:20.630]  of law.
[01:40:20.630 --> 01:40:23.350]  Well, I notice the globalist always said on multiple fronts, they need a bunch of death
[01:40:23.350 --> 01:40:24.470]  numbers not really happening.
[01:40:24.470 --> 01:40:28.070]  So kill people and set the precedent to be able to kill people.
[01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:30.230]  Yep, absolutely.
[01:40:30.230 --> 01:40:34.190]  You know, I mean, to me, they did.
[01:40:34.190 --> 01:40:39.070]  There were so many things that occurred here, so many different aspects of this.
[01:40:39.070 --> 01:40:44.230]  And you know, you look at the military, you look at the military.
[01:40:44.230 --> 01:40:48.350]  When they when they started pushing vaccines and this and another, what they did was the
[01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:51.830]  best and the brightest in the military quit.
[01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:52.830]  They're gone.
[01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:53.830]  Right.
[01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:58.269]  So they're left with whatever was willing to just go along to get along in the same
[01:40:58.269 --> 01:40:59.269]  way.
[01:40:59.269 --> 01:41:01.750]  I think we saw the same thing with doctors and hospitals, right?
[01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:02.750]  It was a test.
[01:41:02.750 --> 01:41:03.750]  It was a purge.
[01:41:03.750 --> 01:41:04.750]  Bingo.
[01:41:04.750 --> 01:41:05.750]  Yeah.
[01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:08.070]  The good doctors and the good nurses left.
[01:41:08.070 --> 01:41:11.510]  And that ties into the Operation Nightingale stuff, right?
[01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:14.710]  Because you have all these doctors and nurses quitting.
[01:41:14.710 --> 01:41:17.910]  Either they didn't want to get the vaccine or they didn't want to murder patients.
[01:41:17.910 --> 01:41:21.070]  So the good ones all quit, creates a huge shortage.
[01:41:21.070 --> 01:41:22.269]  So how do you fill that?
[01:41:22.269 --> 01:41:26.010]  Well, you fill that with crappy doctors and nurses who are willing to do whatever they
[01:41:26.010 --> 01:41:32.110]  need to to sell to sell out or, you know, to just following orders, just following orders.
[01:41:32.110 --> 01:41:36.750]  We got to purge the free thinkers and get those that will just follow orders at any
[01:41:36.830 --> 01:41:38.309]  and all costs.
[01:41:38.309 --> 01:41:43.190]  And that's exactly what was happening in health care and in everything.
[01:41:43.190 --> 01:41:46.670]  I mean, around the board, we don't want anybody who's going to critically think or think
[01:41:46.670 --> 01:41:48.269]  for themselves.
[01:41:48.269 --> 01:41:50.190]  And they're gearing up again to do it.
[01:41:50.190 --> 01:41:51.750]  So we're going to break in a moment.
[01:41:51.750 --> 01:41:52.750]  We've got a minute.
[01:41:52.750 --> 01:41:56.150]  Tell me what else is on your COVID radar.
[01:41:56.150 --> 01:42:00.750]  Biggest thing I would love to talk to next is something called Mod RNA.
[01:42:00.750 --> 01:42:05.230]  I don't know if you've heard of that, but I need to talk about that because it ties in
[01:42:05.230 --> 01:42:06.230]  with the food supply.
[01:42:06.710 --> 01:42:09.350]  You know, I've been doing a bunch of work on the food supply.
[01:42:09.350 --> 01:42:13.750]  And you got to understand, I found this, I'm just finding this and I really would love
[01:42:13.750 --> 01:42:19.550]  to break it and make it go viral right here, because this is how they're spreading disinformation
[01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:23.430]  about the fact they say, well, we can't make mRNA work in the food supply.
[01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:24.430]  It's a lie.
[01:42:24.430 --> 01:42:25.870]  And I think I figured out they're doing it.
[01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:30.390]  And you're also going to get into what was in the vaccines when they kept it all secret.
[01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:31.630]  So you're learning more about that.
[01:42:31.630 --> 01:42:33.030]  Tom Rins, you're amazing.
[01:42:33.030 --> 01:42:34.030]  Stay right there.
[01:42:34.030 --> 01:42:35.030]  And what's the best website?
[01:42:35.830 --> 01:42:37.830]  TomRins.com.
[01:42:37.830 --> 01:42:40.830]  We're putting everything on TomRins.com, pushing it right there.
[01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:42.030]  That's where our sponsors are.
[01:42:42.030 --> 01:42:43.030]  That's where everything is.
[01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:46.030]  And Rins is R-E-N-Z.
[01:42:46.030 --> 01:42:47.030]  Tom Rins.
[01:42:47.030 --> 01:42:48.030]  We'll be right back.
[01:42:48.030 --> 01:42:51.030]  I'm Alex Jones, Infowars.com, Newswars.com.
[01:42:51.030 --> 01:42:52.030]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:42:59.030 --> 01:43:03.430]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:04.830]  Carlson and take him off the air.
[01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:07.430]  People said, no way, he's the most powerful thing that ever happened.
[01:43:07.430 --> 01:43:09.430]  They've got quadrillions of stolen money.
[01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:12.430]  They only had Tucker Carlson on the air because they believed they could control him.
[01:43:12.430 --> 01:43:15.430]  But as soon as they figured out they couldn't, he was taken off the air.
[01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:17.430]  It's the same thing with Infowars.
[01:43:17.430 --> 01:43:23.430]  But Infowars is not owned by Fox or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe
[01:43:23.430 --> 01:43:24.430]  Rogan.
[01:43:24.430 --> 01:43:27.430]  We are only beholden to our viewers and our listeners.
[01:43:27.430 --> 01:43:29.430]  And when you support us, we're unstoppable.
[01:43:29.430 --> 01:43:34.430]  I'm not underwritten by Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros.
[01:43:34.430 --> 01:43:37.430]  I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[01:43:37.430 --> 01:43:41.430]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners to understand,
[01:43:41.430 --> 01:43:43.430]  please don't take Infowars for granted.
[01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:45.430]  We're barely hanging on.
[01:43:45.430 --> 01:43:49.430]  We need your word of mouth, your prayer, your financial support while getting great products
[01:43:49.430 --> 01:43:51.430]  at the same time at Infowars.com.
[01:43:51.430 --> 01:43:52.430]  So don't procrastinate.
[01:43:52.430 --> 01:43:53.430]  Go to Infowars.com.
[01:43:53.430 --> 01:43:57.430]  Get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[01:43:59.430 --> 01:44:00.430]  Infowars.
[01:44:00.430 --> 01:44:02.430]  Tomorrow's news today.
[01:44:02.430 --> 01:44:04.430]  This is their big move.
[01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:08.430]  So, yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[01:44:08.430 --> 01:44:10.430]  He doesn't care.
[01:44:10.430 --> 01:44:11.430]  That's not his job.
[01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:13.430]  He's not the president of the United States.
[01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:16.430]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:21.430]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[01:44:21.430 --> 01:44:23.430]  They must be opposed.
[01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:24.430]  And that's who he works with.
[01:44:24.430 --> 01:44:26.430]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:29.430]  No, no, no.
[01:44:29.430 --> 01:44:30.430]  Exactly.
[01:44:30.430 --> 01:44:33.430]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:36.430]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:39.430]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[01:44:39.430 --> 01:44:41.430]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[01:44:41.430 --> 01:44:45.430]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:47.430]  We say no to you getting us into World War Three.
[01:44:47.430 --> 01:44:48.430]  You're right.
[01:44:48.430 --> 01:44:51.430]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:53.430]  And we say no.
[01:44:53.430 --> 01:44:55.430]  And we say no to your war.
[01:44:57.430 --> 01:45:12.430]  You need to get coordinated with not only your food but also your health supplements
[01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:15.430]  because it's going to be a matter of life and death.
[01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:17.430]  So support Infowars store.
[01:45:17.430 --> 01:45:22.430]  Listen, you need to put it as a priority because you don't know, I don't know.
[01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:25.430]  Alex and I are telling you how late it is before midnight strikes.
[01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:30.430]  And again, magnesium is critical for your muscles and everything.
[01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:31.430]  Krill oil.
[01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:39.430]  What I'm watching right before my eyes is a composite overview of nutritional supplements that will keep you alive.
[01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:41.430]  And I would urge everyone.
[01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:42.430]  Maybe you don't take vitamins.
[01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:44.430]  Maybe you don't take nutritional supplements.
[01:45:44.430 --> 01:45:45.430]  But the day will come.
[01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:48.430]  Vitamin C and zinc, absolutely imperative for the cold.
[01:45:48.430 --> 01:45:50.430]  DNA force, absolutely imperative.
[01:45:50.430 --> 01:45:52.430]  Mineral fusion, absolutely.
[01:45:52.430 --> 01:45:55.430]  As you're drinking filtered water, a lot of it will become demineralized.
[01:45:55.430 --> 01:45:58.430]  You have to have these products.
[01:45:58.430 --> 01:46:02.430]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:46:02.430 --> 01:46:06.430]  is a historic book that documents the globalists in their own words planned for our future.
[01:46:06.430 --> 01:46:08.430]  That is a hellish future.
[01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:11.430]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:46:11.430 --> 01:46:17.430]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or Infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:17.430 --> 01:46:23.430]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:25.430]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[01:46:25.430 --> 01:46:31.430]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:35.430]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:46:35.430 --> 01:46:38.430]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[01:46:38.430 --> 01:46:41.430]  You'll also know that you helped keep Infowars on the air.
[01:46:41.430 --> 01:46:45.430]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:50.430]  I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarsstore.com and get a signed copy
[01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:55.430]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:58.430]  This is an Infowar. I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[01:47:00.430 --> 01:47:06.430]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:08.080 --> 01:47:23.360]  This is do or die stuff, ladies and gentlemen, the whole New World Order operation organized
[01:47:23.360 --> 01:47:31.760]  this, tested it, created it, released it, and then the vaccine was the answer.
[01:47:31.760 --> 01:47:36.559]  So they released the virus to push us into the poison shot, and I want Tom Rims as the
[01:47:36.559 --> 01:47:40.440]  tip of the spear to get into what's really in the shots, they try to keep it secret.
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:42.200]  Is there mRNA being put in the cattle and pigs?
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:45.160]  They admit there is, but they say, don't worry about it.
[01:47:45.160 --> 01:47:49.480]  He's really been the guy that first discovered this eight, nine months ago, and now it's
[01:47:49.480 --> 01:47:50.480]  a huge story.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:52.640]  And first they denied it, now they're admitting it.
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:53.640]  This is just crazy.
[01:47:53.640 --> 01:47:57.160]  So Tom, roll through this right now for us.
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:47:58.559]  All right.
[01:47:58.559 --> 01:48:00.600]  So understand something.
[01:48:00.600 --> 01:48:07.200]  So what we found is, you know, this mRNA issue with animals and transmissible vaccines, and
[01:48:07.200 --> 01:48:10.280]  it's fairly complex, right?
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:15.800]  There's plant-based transmissible vaccines, there's animal-based transmissible vaccines,
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:21.080]  and then there are vaccines that are mRNA based, but not necessarily transmissible, or we don't
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:22.600]  know if they're transmissible.
[01:48:22.600 --> 01:48:27.080]  So what that means is we need to distinguish here a little bit, right?
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:36.640]  So first of all, if an mRNA vaccine is something that is, oh, I don't know, not necessarily,
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:41.120]  we don't know if it's transmissible, but it's given to an animal or whatever, well, what
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:43.400]  happens when you eat that animal, right?
[01:48:43.400 --> 01:48:47.480]  mRNA vaccines do have the potential to genetically modify the creature.
[01:48:47.480 --> 01:48:52.000]  So now you're no longer eating a pig or a cow, you're eating a genetically modified pig
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  or a cow.
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.320]  What's that do in your body when you eat it, when you digest it?
[01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:58.360]  And the answer is, I don't know.
[01:48:58.360 --> 01:49:03.120]  I've done a lot of work, I've tried to find research, I've tried to find follow-up studies,
[01:49:03.120 --> 01:49:08.680]  there's my sub-stack, you know, and we don't know.
[01:49:08.680 --> 01:49:12.960]  Now with this sub-stack, we talk about eating your vaccines, your vegetables.
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:18.680]  This goes to the other issue, which is the transmissible vaccines, right?
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:21.000]  The transmissible vaccines.
[01:49:21.000 --> 01:49:26.600]  Now this appears to be something that can be done in both plants and animals.
[01:49:26.600 --> 01:49:30.800]  And the first study I was able to find goes back to 2005, they created a transmissible
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:35.200]  hepatitis B vaccine in potatoes, right?
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:40.800]  And if you look, I've got a wonderful article published on NIH where they talk about the
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:46.960]  various plants that they use, and they say actually one of the most, the best plants
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:52.360]  that they could use on this for mRNA vaccines is lettuce.
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:56.000]  But there's a lot of these plants that they can use, alfalfa is listed in that particular
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:50:02.200]  article, which is interesting because it's a feed plant for our animals.
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:06.960]  But we see that they have transmissible vaccines, then we see Medicago.
[01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:11.660]  Medicago is a company, they're creating plant-based COVID vaccines.
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:16.480]  They had a greenhouse in San Diego, I think that's since been shut down.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:23.440]  But I do believe Medicago's plant-based vaccines are actually licensed in Canada.
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:27.240]  I'd have to double check, but I'm pretty sure they're licensed in Canada.
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:31.760]  And it's, you eat the plant, you get the vaccine, you're vaccinated, right?
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:33.160]  That's the purpose.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:37.400]  There's tons of studies, tons of evidence, tons of information on this, where what they're
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:41.880]  doing is they're talking about and showing, hey, if you eat your vegetables, you can get
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:43.440]  your vaccine.
[01:50:43.480 --> 01:50:48.519]  And to the Bill Gates crowd, to the globalists, this is a win.
[01:50:48.519 --> 01:50:55.360]  Because if the globalists can get you to get this stuff more easily, well, they figure
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:58.160]  more people can be vaccinated.
[01:50:58.160 --> 01:51:03.040]  The problem is, is the way the laws apply for food, you may or may not be getting informed
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:04.040]  consent.
[01:51:04.040 --> 01:51:06.660]  Then we look at animal vaccines.
[01:51:06.660 --> 01:51:08.840]  And this is where it gets particularly interesting.
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:13.880]  And actually, for both plant and animal-based vaccines, one of the things that I get in
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:17.840]  response from a lot of the crooked scientists out there, and I'm talking about the crooked
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:22.840]  ones, is, oh, mRNA is a very fragile particle.
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:23.840]  Very, very fragile.
[01:51:23.840 --> 01:51:24.840]  It can break down.
[01:51:24.840 --> 01:51:25.840]  It can fall apart.
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:27.360]  It'll never survive digestion.
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.840]  So an ingestible vaccine is just not a thing.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:31.840]  Okay.
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:35.280]  Alex, this is what's, I want to break this here.
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:38.400]  I want to break this, and I want people to hear me.
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:44.400]  mRNA is a naturally occurring particle, and it is fairly fragile.
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:52.040]  What they've done is they've produced something called mod RNA, M-O-D, as in modified RNA.
[01:51:52.040 --> 01:51:53.440]  It's a synthetic RNA.
[01:51:53.440 --> 01:51:54.820]  It's not real.
[01:51:54.820 --> 01:51:55.820]  It's not natural.
[01:51:55.820 --> 01:52:00.600]  What it is, is it's something that's created in a lab, and they created it specifically
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:05.000]  to get around the fact that RNA is such a fragile particle.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:10.680]  They needed to strengthen RNA, these RNA platforms, so that they could get them into your system
[01:52:10.680 --> 01:52:14.760]  in various ways without it being impossible to transport this at another.
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:19.280]  mRNA as an idea has been around for a long time, but they couldn't get it to work because
[01:52:19.280 --> 01:52:21.180]  it was such a fragile particle.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:25.080]  So there were breakthroughs going back a number of years, and I'm looking right now on my
[01:52:25.080 --> 01:52:26.080]  other screen.
[01:52:26.080 --> 01:52:33.040]  I've got an article in 2015 talking about the use of mod RNA.
[01:52:33.080 --> 01:52:36.640]  They've been working on this for a number of years, and by the way, 2015 is when we
[01:52:36.640 --> 01:52:43.000]  have whistleblower data suggesting that they created SARS-CoV-2 in the Wuhan lab, and it
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:49.400]  appears that they tried to create the cure at the same time as the disease, but that's
[01:52:49.400 --> 01:52:50.400]  another thing.
[01:52:50.400 --> 01:52:57.160]  So when we look at mod RNA, the rules for mRNA don't apply to mod RNA.
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:00.440]  The rules are different because what it is, is it's a synthetic particle.
[01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:02.880]  It's designed to be more robust.
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:05.320]  So that explains why we're seeing some of these other studies.
[01:53:05.320 --> 01:53:12.360]  So for example, we've got a study out of China where the Chinese scientists are claiming
[01:53:12.360 --> 01:53:21.880]  that they were able to take this mRNA, which mRNA and mod RNA frequently seem to be used
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:27.680]  interchangeably when these psychopaths are talking about it, but there is a difference.
[01:53:27.680 --> 01:53:29.960]  mRNA is a naturally occurring particle.
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:31.960]  Mod RNA is not.
[01:53:31.960 --> 01:53:39.480]  The mod RNA vaccines given then to these cows, well, in this study, these cows then
[01:53:39.480 --> 01:53:47.080]  after being given the mod RNA, their milk transmitted the vaccines, right?
[01:53:47.080 --> 01:53:51.160]  They transmitted, they showed that it was transmissible through the cow's milk once it
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:52.360]  got that.
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:57.440]  Now this presents a real issue because there's no country of origin labeling.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:07.200]  If you can modify an animal or a plant to include a vaccine and those vaccines can then
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:14.240]  be used to vaccinate whoever ingests the plant, the animal, the whatever, and it can be done
[01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:17.320]  so and there's no country of origin labeling.
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:19.720]  So it's the perfect way to just interrupt.
[01:54:19.720 --> 01:54:24.440]  This is riveting, but bottom line, Bill Gates has said for 20 years, the key will be vaccines
[01:54:24.440 --> 01:54:27.040]  in food and vegetables, meat and vegetables.
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:28.480]  They're doing it now.
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:30.000]  It does pass over to us.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:32.880]  Even Pfizer admitted that their vaccine can shed.
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:34.360]  So that's what they're doing.
[01:54:34.360 --> 01:54:38.160]  And they're just one way or another, they're, I mean, this is so criminal.
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:39.160]  So am I wrong?
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:44.200]  There's major liability in the fact that all this unapproved stuff is just being put in
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:47.680]  plants and animals and they're just bum rushing us.
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:50.400]  I would argue that there should be, and there probably will be.
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:54.160]  They're trying to use some legal loopholes on food versus medicine.
[01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:58.800]  But I'll tell you, Alex, one of the things that I really want to make sure that you hear
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:02.920]  me on is this MoD RNA.
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:06.960]  They call it mRNA, but if you look at the Pfizer ingredients or the Moderna ingredients,
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:10.640]  you'll see that it doesn't say mRNA, it says MoD RNA.
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:12.519]  I've got some labels showing that.
[01:55:12.519 --> 01:55:17.800]  That MoD RNA, that synthetic particle that they create in a lab, see, what they're saying
[01:55:17.800 --> 01:55:18.800]  is-
[01:55:18.800 --> 01:55:19.800]  It's nanotech.
[01:55:19.800 --> 01:55:20.800]  It's nanotech.
[01:55:20.800 --> 01:55:22.559]  I got to go to break here in a minute or two.
[01:55:22.559 --> 01:55:24.600]  Can you do five more minutes?
[01:55:24.600 --> 01:55:25.600]  Sure.
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:30.760]  And then we have another special guest joining us coming up after that, Stu Peters.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:33.200]  So stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:34.200]  Tom Renz.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:36.640]  Renz is doing so much great work.
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:37.640]  We'll be right back to you.
[01:55:37.640 --> 01:55:43.160]  I need to pause here because I get so focused on these guests and so focused on the intel.
[01:55:43.160 --> 01:55:45.760]  If I don't promote the products we sell, we shut down.
[01:55:45.760 --> 01:55:48.600]  We're barely in the black, but that's not the reason you want these products.
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:50.280]  Yeah, it keeps us on air.
[01:55:50.280 --> 01:55:51.280]  Yes, tip of the spear.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:52.920]  We're saving so many lives.
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:56.400]  We're fighting their next big rollout, next big pandemic, but these are really great
[01:55:56.400 --> 01:55:57.400]  products you need.
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:56:03.400]  The Ultimate Bone Broth, the 10-Hour Clean Energy Turbo Force, X3, our full-spectrum
[01:56:03.400 --> 01:56:06.240]  CBD oil, the books, the films, the t-shirts.
[01:56:06.240 --> 01:56:15.639]  This is the Infowar, and things are so serious, I just need a larger percentage of the viewers
[01:56:15.639 --> 01:56:20.440]  to reach out and to become customers at InfowarStore.com.
[01:56:20.440 --> 01:56:23.040]  We have the highest quality water filters.
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:27.720]  There's like four or five companies that have the same ratings, but they sell for two
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:29.200]  to three times more.
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:33.000]  We have stainless steel gravity-fed water filters that are the lowest price anybody's
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.520]  got for this quality.
[01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:39.280]  This is the highest rated filters at, on average, half the price.
[01:56:39.280 --> 01:56:40.960]  Everybody needs this in their home.
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:43.800]  Everybody should be filtering their water, whether it's well water, you name it.
[01:56:43.800 --> 01:56:45.000]  Most of it is full of crap.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:48.000]  This cuts everything out to non-technical levels.
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:53.200]  InfowarStore.com, the fluoride, the bromine, the atrazine.
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:59.880]  You need to be doing this for you and your family, InfowarStore.com or 888-253-3139.

[01:57:03.280 --> 01:57:04.280]  ready to ship.
[01:57:04.280 --> 01:57:06.960]  Everybody needs to get prepared, and this funds our operation.
[01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:12.400]  I want to thank you all for your support, and I want to ask those who do want to experience
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:15.880]  these great products to get them, to go action.

[01:57:17.639 --> 01:57:19.800]  You saw, we finally have a budget to send Owen to the border.
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:23.600]  Tens of millions of views, exposed it, huge, you know, we're fighting back.
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:28.080]  I'd be at Bilderberg right now covering it, but don't have the funds to go to Europe.
[01:57:28.080 --> 01:57:31.680]  We will do everything we did in the past and be more effective, but it's up to you.
[01:57:31.680 --> 01:57:33.800]  Our future is in your hands.
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:35.040]  This is not just Alex Jones and the show.
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:38.320]  It's all these other amazing researchers, guests, people like Tom Renz.
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:41.440]  So go now and back us in this fight.
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:42.440]  You are the Paul Reveres.
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:43.440]  Whatever you do, spread the word about the broadcast.
[01:57:46.640 --> 01:57:51.800]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[01:57:51.800 --> 01:57:53.880]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:55.920]  It will change your life.
[01:57:55.920 --> 01:58:00.600]  The UN admits and the Lancet Medical Journal admits that upwards of 2 billion people have
[01:58:00.600 --> 01:58:04.640]  mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[01:58:04.640 --> 01:58:10.160]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[01:58:10.160 --> 01:58:15.920]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[01:58:15.920 --> 01:58:20.160]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:26.280]  And Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:27.280]  effect.
[01:58:27.280 --> 01:58:30.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months.
[01:58:30.280 --> 01:58:33.280]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:36.280]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[01:58:36.280 --> 01:58:38.440]  This ladies and gentlemen is powerful.
[01:58:38.440 --> 01:58:39.760]  You and your family need it.
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:41.960]  It's 25% off back in stock.
[01:58:41.960 --> 01:58:42.960]  X3.

[01:58:49.000 --> 01:58:52.840]  This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show, joined by the one and only Greg Reiss of The
[01:58:52.840 --> 01:58:53.840]  Reiss Report.
[01:58:53.840 --> 01:58:57.520]  We wanted to hop on and send everybody to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:58:57.520 --> 01:59:00.120]  Click this QR code right above Greg Reiss.
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:05.880]  Buy yourself a Faraday cage, super male vitality, or what Greg has.
[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:07.320]  Greg, what do you got there?
[01:59:07.320 --> 01:59:11.640]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice, get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:16.360]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it, wherever you want it.
[01:59:16.360 --> 01:59:21.760]  Even if the water pressure goes out, the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:23.400]  Absolutely.
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:28.440]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[01:59:28.440 --> 01:59:33.120]  I was telling Greg earlier, we're like the real NPR, the real NPR of the base, right?
[01:59:33.120 --> 01:59:36.200]  So click that QR code right there on your screen right now.
[01:59:36.200 --> 01:59:37.200]  Take out your phone.

[01:59:38.200 --> 01:59:40.360]  It'll take you directly to Infowarsstore.com.
[01:59:40.360 --> 01:59:41.360]  Buy something.
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:42.360]  Support the Infowar.
[01:59:42.360 --> 01:59:45.800]  Keep Alex Jones, Orrin Schroer, Harrison Smith, Greg Reiss, Adam King, and the rest of us
[01:59:45.800 --> 01:59:46.800]  on air.
[01:59:46.800 --> 01:59:47.800]  Do it today.
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:48.800]  Do it now.
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:49.800]  Support the Infowar.
[01:59:49.800 --> 01:59:58.200]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:59:58.200 --> 02:00:08.840]  All right, final segment with attorney Tom Renz.
[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:15.400]  Stu Peters joining us with massive news information, next segment.
[02:00:15.400 --> 02:00:23.160]  But getting into this mod, MRNA, that's this other name for nanotech, self-replicating,
[02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:27.560]  and it's just insane that the establishment is even doing this, even though they want
[02:00:27.560 --> 02:00:28.560]  to kill us.
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:29.560]  It's so dangerous.
[02:00:29.560 --> 02:00:30.560]  So finish up.
[02:00:30.560 --> 02:00:31.560]  Tell us about that.
[02:00:31.560 --> 02:00:32.560]  Okay.
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:37.560]  So I've got two studies published on NIH, and I know nobody likes it when you read,
[02:00:37.560 --> 02:00:40.680]  but I don't think there's anything more powerful than their words.
[02:00:40.680 --> 02:00:46.000]  This is a study from 2015, and they're talking about mod RNA.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:50.400]  They talk about challenges that have to be addressed in developing mod RNA, and this
[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:52.400]  is in 2015.
[02:00:52.400 --> 02:00:57.840]  They talk about chemical modifications, at the time were relatively primitive, and they
[02:00:57.840 --> 02:01:04.560]  need to be improved to allow negligible signals from innate immunity from being elicited,
[02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:05.560]  right?
[02:01:05.560 --> 02:01:08.800]  So they need to trick your immune system, right?
[02:01:08.800 --> 02:01:13.380]  At the same time, modifications need to be made to make them more biologically compatible
[02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:17.400]  to allow higher translation efficiency, translation.
[02:01:17.400 --> 02:01:20.360]  Why are these translating into your body?
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:21.560]  What do you mean you're translating?
[02:01:21.720 --> 02:01:23.240]  I thought these don't modify anything.
[02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:26.200]  I thought they just create messenger proteins.
[02:01:26.200 --> 02:01:29.520]  I just thought that they weren't supposed to modify our DNA.
[02:01:29.520 --> 02:01:34.760]  They go on to talk about other issues, you know, getting less toxic characters, and the
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:41.280]  fact that these, at the time, weren't targeted for specific tissues, things like that.
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:47.880]  Now I want to jump forward to 2021 and another NIH-published study.
[02:01:47.880 --> 02:01:52.400]  Now again, differentiate between mod RNA and mRNA.
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:54.360]  They're not using mRNA.
[02:01:54.360 --> 02:01:58.240]  They're using mod RNA, and this is critical.
[02:01:58.240 --> 02:02:07.320]  Now this abstract of this starts with, quote, reprogramming non-cardiomyocytes into cardiomyocyte
[02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:12.800]  like cells is a promising strategy for cardiac regeneration in conditions such as ischemic
[02:02:12.800 --> 02:02:14.560]  heart disease.
[02:02:14.560 --> 02:02:22.600]  We here, we used modified mRNA gene delivery platform to deliver a cocktail termed, dot,
[02:02:22.600 --> 02:02:29.760]  dot, dot, of four cardiac, quote, reprogramming genes.
[02:02:29.760 --> 02:02:33.920]  Alex, they aren't using mRNA.
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:37.920]  They're using mod RNA, and they are reprogramming our genes.
[02:02:37.920 --> 02:02:39.680]  It says so right here.
[02:02:39.680 --> 02:02:49.000]  It goes on later to talk about, and it says, quote, mod RNA is currently being used around
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:54.080]  the globe for vaccination against COVID-19.
[02:02:54.080 --> 02:02:59.640]  They know they are creating genetic changes in humanity, and they are doing so intentionally,
[02:02:59.640 --> 02:03:01.400]  and they're not telling you.
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:02.920]  That's how I read this.
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:03.920]  Incredible.
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:06.560]  You've got to come back on, and I've seen the documents.
[02:03:06.560 --> 02:03:09.000]  I'm familiar with this, but you're really hammering it.
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:10.520]  Send us all those studies.
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:11.520]  We'll get more.
[02:03:11.520 --> 02:03:16.600]  Come back on next week, and host an hour, host two hours with us, and let's go through
[02:03:16.600 --> 02:03:23.040]  all the documents, but yes, they admit the COVID shots are modifying DNA, and they've
[02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:26.480]  tried gene therapy before, and it kills a good percent of the people that take it.
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:29.600]  That's why they can never roll it out, so now they're just trying to roll it out anyways,
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:33.400]  just cover up the death, so they find the life essential for themselves, and we're used
[02:03:33.400 --> 02:03:35.080]  as guinea pigs.
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:36.340]  Absolutely.
[02:03:36.340 --> 02:03:42.340]  This is nothing more than the greatest human experiment in history, and the most egregious
[02:03:42.340 --> 02:03:44.940]  crime against humanity in history.
[02:03:44.940 --> 02:03:49.680]  This is every bit the equivalent to Nuremberg, and what we dealt with there.
[02:03:49.680 --> 02:03:52.220]  We have got to hold these people accountable.
[02:03:52.220 --> 02:03:53.880]  There need to be trials.
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:55.000]  They need to be public.
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:58.380]  There needs to be 100% disclosure and transparency.
[02:03:58.380 --> 02:04:05.100]  These people are intentionally modifying humanity in some genetic way that I don't fully understand,
[02:04:05.140 --> 02:04:11.340]  and I'll admit that, but these studies suggest to me very strongly that they are aware of
[02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:12.340]  the gene-altering technology.
[02:04:12.340 --> 02:04:13.340]  Well, of course they are.
[02:04:13.340 --> 02:04:17.460]  That's why Schwarzenegger and all of them said they're going to live forever, and President
[02:04:17.460 --> 02:04:22.860]  Trump's son-in-law, Jerry Kusher, because they believe out of this, they're going to
[02:04:22.860 --> 02:04:26.900]  find a way to live forever, but they're using us as the test.
[02:04:26.900 --> 02:04:28.260]  Tom Renz, thank you so much.
[02:04:28.260 --> 02:04:29.260]  God bless you.
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:30.260]  We'll talk to you very, very soon.
[02:04:30.260 --> 02:04:32.900]  In fact, before you go, if you can tell them when you want to come on next week, we'll
[02:04:32.900 --> 02:04:34.900]  set it up right now, sir.
[02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:35.900]  Sounds good.
[02:04:35.900 --> 02:04:36.900]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:36.900 --> 02:04:37.900]  All right.
[02:04:37.900 --> 02:04:38.900]  Thank you, sir.
[02:04:38.900 --> 02:04:40.340]  Well, you talk about a flamethrower of truth.
[02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:42.180]  We were just talking to him in another one.
[02:04:42.180 --> 02:04:44.820]  What a star-studded event here at Liberty.
[02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:51.260]  Stu Peters, of the real Stu Peters, is coming up straight ahead in the next hour.
[02:04:51.260 --> 02:04:59.380]  We are going to knock it out of the park in the fight against the NWO.
[02:04:59.380 --> 02:05:04.100]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you, hidden
[02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:05.780]  in plain view.
[02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:08.500]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:12.780]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website, where they admit the number
[02:05:12.780 --> 02:05:18.020]  one cause of cognitive disability in the world is iodine deficiency.
[02:05:18.020 --> 02:05:25.300]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability is lack of real, pure iodine in
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:31.620]  the body, as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and so much more.
[02:05:31.620 --> 02:05:37.300]  Upwards of two billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal study in 2007 worldwide have
[02:05:37.300 --> 02:05:41.700]  cognitive disabilities because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:43.940]  Most iodine is bound to other elements you don't absorb it.
[02:05:43.940 --> 02:05:49.620]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine together that supercharges your body.
[02:05:49.620 --> 02:05:51.780]  X3 is now back in stock at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:55.620]  It's been sold out for over six months for 25% off.
[02:05:55.620 --> 02:05:56.980]  X3, back in stock.
[02:05:56.980 --> 02:05:57.980]  Take action now.
[02:05:57.980 --> 02:05:58.980]  Infowarsstore.com.
[02:06:02.620 --> 02:06:08.620]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:06:08.620 --> 02:06:15.620]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:06:32.620 --> 02:06:38.620]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live in hour number three of the Alex Jones
[02:06:38.620 --> 02:06:44.340]  show on this Thursday, May 18th, 2023 broadcast.
[02:06:44.340 --> 02:06:49.020]  And we are joined by the great Stu Peters right now, StuPeters.com, syndicated talk
[02:06:49.020 --> 02:06:53.740]  show host, and absolutely kicking butt out there, exposing the globalist.
[02:06:53.740 --> 02:06:59.820]  I want to get into some of the reports he's done about the latest videos of the globalist
[02:07:00.020 --> 02:07:03.420]  high priest of all Noah Harari and AI controlling elections.
[02:07:03.420 --> 02:07:05.140]  We'll get to that next segment.
[02:07:05.140 --> 02:07:12.540]  But first, the top of the drugs report, why CNBC, CBS News, Bilderberg elites meet in Lisbon
[02:07:12.540 --> 02:07:17.820]  to save us from AI that they're deploying in a big article on Infowars.com.
[02:07:17.820 --> 02:07:25.100]  ADL ran an extensive multidimensional counterintelligence operation against conservative and nationalist
[02:07:25.100 --> 02:07:30.420]  and populist groups since the 1960s, working with law enforcement and the CIA and posing
[02:07:30.420 --> 02:07:39.060]  as fake racists to demonize groups like the Patriot Front we are seeing right now.
[02:07:39.060 --> 02:07:40.460]  So just an incredible time to be alive.
[02:07:40.460 --> 02:07:44.100]  We have Obama calls for Australian-style gun confiscation.
[02:07:44.100 --> 02:07:51.460]  But the first clip I want to play, Stu's take on here, is this piece of information.
[02:07:51.460 --> 02:07:58.580]  Obama pines for old days when media narrative was accepted by all as a common set of facts.
[02:07:58.580 --> 02:08:00.380]  He admits they're losing.
[02:08:00.380 --> 02:08:04.660]  He admits the public is not buying their garbage anymore.
[02:08:04.660 --> 02:08:05.160]  Here it is.
[02:08:05.360 --> 02:08:15.120]  I'm an optimistic man, but I find myself falling into this space where I have concern about
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:18.679]  the country that they will inherit once I'm gone.
[02:08:18.679 --> 02:08:22.639]  Post-presidency, what about this country keeps you up at night?
[02:08:22.639 --> 02:08:35.240]  The thing that I'm most worried about is the degree to which we now have a divided conversation
[02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:42.040]  in part because we have a divided media, so I'm much older than you, Nate.
[02:08:42.040 --> 02:08:43.639]  You don't look it, though.
[02:08:43.639 --> 02:08:47.000]  That's what I was fishing for.
[02:08:47.000 --> 02:08:52.839]  But when I was coming up, you had three TV stations, and people were getting a similar
[02:08:52.839 --> 02:08:57.200]  sense of what is true and what isn't, what was real and what was not.
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:09:01.920]  Today, what I'm most concerned about is the fact that because of the splintering of the
[02:09:01.920 --> 02:09:05.160]  media, we almost occupy different realities.
[02:09:05.160 --> 02:09:10.040]  If something happens, in the past, everybody could say, all right, we may disagree on how
[02:09:10.040 --> 02:09:13.719]  to solve it, but at least we all agree that, yeah, that's an issue.
[02:09:13.719 --> 02:09:17.599]  Now people will say, well, that didn't happen, or I don't believe that.
[02:09:17.599 --> 02:09:23.920]  And one of, I think, the goals of the Obama Foundation and one of the goals of my post-presidency
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:27.920]  is how do we return to that common conversation?
[02:09:27.920 --> 02:09:30.040]  How can we have a common set of facts?
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:36.240]  We may disagree on gun violence in terms of what the best prescriptions are, but we
[02:09:36.240 --> 02:09:44.400]  can't deny the data that says the United States has levels of gun violence that are 5, 10,
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:47.719]  15 times more than other countries.
[02:09:47.719 --> 02:09:48.719]  Yep.
[02:09:48.719 --> 02:09:51.400]  Guns, those other countries don't have guns.
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:57.080]  They have 5, 10, 15 times the baseball bat and the butcher knife.
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:01.440]  But no, we can't agree on your set of facts that two men can have a baby.
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:04.040]  We can't agree on your set of facts that Jeffrey Epstein's a great guy.
[02:10:04.040 --> 02:10:07.960]  We can't agree on your set of facts that open borders is good.
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:11.040]  Joining us now is Stu Peters of stupeters.com.
[02:10:11.040 --> 02:10:12.880]  Stu, great to have you.
[02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:14.200]  And you've been popular for years.
[02:10:14.200 --> 02:10:18.360]  Congratulations on how much you've exploded and how much the enemy's coming after you.
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:19.360]  Wow.
[02:10:19.360 --> 02:10:23.599]  I mean, just responding to the Bilderberg Group out in the open, we've got Elon Musk
[02:10:23.599 --> 02:10:26.639]  coming out against the ADL saying they're not the ADL.
[02:10:27.200 --> 02:10:29.360]  They're just the Defamation League.
[02:10:29.360 --> 02:10:31.799]  Things are not going well for the new world order right now, in my view.
[02:10:31.799 --> 02:10:33.320]  They're not going well for us either.
[02:10:33.320 --> 02:10:34.639]  But you heard Obama.
[02:10:34.639 --> 02:10:38.839]  He said people aren't believing our bullshit anymore.
[02:10:38.839 --> 02:10:44.120]  And so what he said about agreeing with, you know, having a common set of facts, like what
[02:10:44.120 --> 02:10:45.120]  does that even mean?
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:46.120]  What does that suggest to you?
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:51.240]  What that suggests, what that tells me is that for decades, for years, we haven't had
[02:10:51.240 --> 02:10:52.240]  an honest media.
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:54.320]  You've been calling this out for decades.
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:58.280]  I don't know how many times I've said on Twitter over the last three weeks, Alex Jones was
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:59.280]  right.
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:00.280]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:11:00.280 --> 02:11:01.559]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:11:01.559 --> 02:11:05.799]  But more and more people, especially since like current times with the dismissal of Tucker
[02:11:05.799 --> 02:11:06.799]  Carlson.
[02:11:06.799 --> 02:11:10.599]  I'm going to be talking tonight on my show with Victor Davis Hanson, who was a regular
[02:11:10.599 --> 02:11:11.599]  on Tucker Carlson.
[02:11:11.599 --> 02:11:15.240]  I mean, when you have all of these different rumors going around about what was the reason,
[02:11:15.240 --> 02:11:17.160]  what was the reason for the parting?
[02:11:17.160 --> 02:11:21.440]  He was there on a Friday, said we'll see you Monday, didn't come back on a Monday.
[02:11:21.559 --> 02:11:26.480]  And you have every single dissenting voice in America that has been just completely attacked,
[02:11:26.480 --> 02:11:35.519]  but it has has risen so, so that the trajectory of the rise of alternative media is like something
[02:11:35.519 --> 02:11:37.639]  that I never thought that I would ever see ever.
[02:11:37.639 --> 02:11:40.839]  And I'm so thankful that it's happening.
[02:11:40.839 --> 02:11:42.280]  You're probably seeing it with Infowars.
[02:11:42.280 --> 02:11:43.839]  I know that we're seeing it at the Stu Peter show.
[02:11:43.839 --> 02:11:47.759]  And I think that wherever Tucker Carlson goes, his audience will dwarf the audience that
[02:11:47.759 --> 02:11:49.679]  you see on the Fox News channel.
[02:11:49.679 --> 02:11:53.200]  And during any time slot, I think that Fox is actually finished.
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:57.960]  But when you have an ADL that can literally take anybody off the air, who I believe was
[02:11:57.960 --> 02:12:02.839]  ultimately probably behind the removal of Tucker and others from being on the air.
[02:12:02.839 --> 02:12:08.519]  When you have an ADL that's that powerful, that has its hooks into the levers of power
[02:12:08.519 --> 02:12:14.040]  that is not a government, but a corporate crime syndicate with Obama sitting at the center
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:20.880]  at the helm really with Valerie Jarrett and Susan Rice that ran his administration
[02:12:20.880 --> 02:12:26.840]  still in the alleged Biden White House where we have an illegitimate president, an FBI
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:27.840]  orchestrated.
[02:12:27.840 --> 02:12:33.519]  Now we have 300 pages from John Durham showing that this was a complete orchestration set
[02:12:33.519 --> 02:12:40.960]  up by the FBI to set up a sitting US president for Russia collusion to make a US president
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:45.559]  look like he was colluding with an adversary of the United States.
[02:12:45.559 --> 02:12:51.000]  And we still have these same people controlling the levers of power.
[02:12:51.000 --> 02:12:54.360]  And then you have a Congress that is doing absolutely nothing about it.
[02:12:54.360 --> 02:13:01.360]  So right now, what should happen immediately after 300 pages of stone cold proof, inarguable,
[02:13:01.360 --> 02:13:07.160]  you know, evidentiary substance from John Durham, 300 pages that show that the FBI is
[02:13:07.160 --> 02:13:11.240]  a criminal organization, a terrorist network and should be treated accordingly.
[02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:17.360]  We don't have one member of Congress saying they all need to be arrested today, just disband
[02:13:17.360 --> 02:13:19.799]  them, abolish them, declassify all of their documents.
[02:13:19.799 --> 02:13:23.960]  Did you see Lindsey Graham saying when the FBI wrongfully put people in jail or call
[02:13:23.960 --> 02:13:26.599]  them Russians, they should call and say they're sorry.
[02:13:26.599 --> 02:13:31.320]  And again, I don't want to go to war with the FBI for no reason, but it is totally captured.
[02:13:31.320 --> 02:13:33.280]  The Justice Department is totally captured.
[02:13:33.280 --> 02:13:37.059]  But the good news is America's waking up that there is a coup.
[02:13:37.059 --> 02:13:38.940]  We have an occupational government.
[02:13:38.940 --> 02:13:41.820]  Literally, we're an occupied nation by the globalists.
[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:42.820]  Yeah.
[02:13:42.820 --> 02:13:45.660]  And I mean, I don't want to go to war with the FBI either.
[02:13:45.660 --> 02:13:48.740]  I just want to completely defund them and completely abolish them and arrest most of
[02:13:48.740 --> 02:13:49.740]  its agents.
[02:13:49.740 --> 02:13:52.780]  I mean, these people are a criminal enterprise.
[02:13:52.780 --> 02:13:57.580]  And when you have a terrorist network, they need to be designated and classified and deemed
[02:13:57.580 --> 02:13:58.860]  to be a terrorist network.
[02:13:58.860 --> 02:14:01.780]  And then they need to be treated accordingly, which means that you need to arrest them.
[02:14:01.780 --> 02:14:05.139]  And thank God that Obama didn't, you know, make good on his promise to close Gitmo because
[02:14:05.139 --> 02:14:06.700]  we've got plenty of room to house these people.
[02:14:06.700 --> 02:14:08.219]  I mean, these are high crimes.
[02:14:08.219 --> 02:14:11.379]  This is open declaration of war against Americans.
[02:14:11.379 --> 02:14:12.379]  And it's being perpetuated.
[02:14:12.379 --> 02:14:16.019]  I totally agree with you that we should put the leadership of the FBI in Gitmo.
[02:14:16.019 --> 02:14:17.900]  But and I'm not an apologist, this guy.
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:23.099]  We have over 10,000 whistleblowers in the last year from the FBI, from the Justice Department,
[02:14:23.099 --> 02:14:24.099]  from ICE.
[02:14:24.099 --> 02:14:28.259]  So there are a bunch of people there that we should see unending hearings.
[02:14:28.259 --> 02:14:31.299]  We should see the entire leadership impeached and arrested.
[02:14:31.299 --> 02:14:32.299]  I agree with you.
[02:14:32.460 --> 02:14:37.460]  I mean, because they really are an international crime syndicate that's hijacked the country.
[02:14:37.460 --> 02:14:38.460]  I mean, that's a fact.
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:39.460]  That's not hyperbole.
[02:14:39.460 --> 02:14:40.460]  Yeah.
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:42.179]  And so start over.
[02:14:42.179 --> 02:14:47.500]  You know, essentially, they cannot be referred to as an elite police force anymore that does,
[02:14:47.500 --> 02:14:49.559]  you know, anything to uphold the rule of law here.
[02:14:49.559 --> 02:14:51.700]  They actually do the opposite.
[02:14:51.700 --> 02:14:52.860]  They subvert the rule of law.
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:56.420]  Do you think they've realized how much they're discredited, destroyed, or they live in their
[02:14:56.420 --> 02:15:00.219]  own little Obama bubble where they still think they have power?
[02:15:00.219 --> 02:15:02.540]  You want to I mean, the answer to that is I don't think they care.
[02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:05.860]  I think that the hubris and the arrogance is just right out in the wide open.
[02:15:05.860 --> 02:15:10.660]  These people are running a coup that is taking over the entire West and they are destroying
[02:15:10.660 --> 02:15:11.660]  civilization.
[02:15:11.660 --> 02:15:15.139]  Tom Renz talking about altering the DNA of people.
[02:15:15.139 --> 02:15:18.500]  This is open declaration of war against freedom and liberty.
[02:15:18.500 --> 02:15:20.860]  And they are coming for all of the superpowers in the West.
[02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:22.379]  They're coming for Christianity.
[02:15:22.379 --> 02:15:23.820]  They're coming for the white replacement.
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:24.820]  This is all real.
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:27.259]  None of this has been conspiracy theory and they're carrying it out right now.
[02:15:27.259 --> 02:15:28.259]  Yeah.
[02:15:28.259 --> 02:15:32.099]  The ADL says it's white replacement and the ADL says arrest you if you cover it.
[02:15:32.099 --> 02:15:34.860]  The ADL still says the Bilderberg group doesn't exist.
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:37.620]  While it's on the news, Bilderberg group to save you from AI.
[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:42.740]  I mean, it's I noticed some of the left attack me yesterday saying, look, Jones claims Bill
[02:15:42.740 --> 02:15:47.420]  Gates is doing weather modification and they show the CBS headline where Bill Gates to
[02:15:47.420 --> 02:15:48.740]  block the sun.
[02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:50.019]  All I did was cover it.
[02:15:50.019 --> 02:15:51.700]  They say I'm crazy.
[02:15:51.700 --> 02:15:53.099]  It's not real.
[02:15:53.099 --> 02:15:55.700]  While he's on CBS promoting it.
[02:15:55.700 --> 02:15:58.299]  What level of gaslighting is that, Stu?
[02:15:58.299 --> 02:15:59.299]  Yeah.
[02:15:59.299 --> 02:16:00.299]  The gaslighting never stops.
[02:16:00.299 --> 02:16:03.660]  I mean, these are the same people that told you that they had safe and effective shots
[02:16:03.660 --> 02:16:09.259]  and that you were going to essentially be a murderer if you were not vaccinated and if
[02:16:09.259 --> 02:16:13.780]  you didn't stay inside of your own home, that you were not allowed to go and see, you know,
[02:16:13.780 --> 02:16:14.900]  your friends and your family.
[02:16:14.900 --> 02:16:18.099]  I mean, your grandma and grandpa, your aunt and your uncle, your mom and dad that are
[02:16:18.099 --> 02:16:19.259]  dying in the hospital.
[02:16:19.259 --> 02:16:22.219]  By the way, they walked in under their own horsepower.
[02:16:22.219 --> 02:16:26.340]  But yet this doctor is only allowed to use the protocols that are coming down from the
[02:16:26.340 --> 02:16:30.820]  NIH through epic machines, which, by the way, are controlled by AI.
[02:16:30.820 --> 02:16:32.220]  So now we have AI doctors.
[02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:35.100]  I mean, yeah, they're humans that are actually carrying out.
[02:16:35.100 --> 02:16:36.340]  That's a key point.
[02:16:36.340 --> 02:16:40.260]  Starting three years ago, this was the first we know of directed AI murder.
[02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:45.420]  Forget autonomous drones, AI at these key hospitals ran the murder.
[02:16:45.420 --> 02:16:46.420]  That's right.
[02:16:46.420 --> 02:16:50.940]  And so essentially you have these zombies with stethoscopes and white lab coats that
[02:16:50.940 --> 02:16:54.699]  are, yeah, they're human beings, but they're being told what to do by AI.
[02:16:54.699 --> 02:16:55.940]  And that is prescribed this.
[02:16:55.940 --> 02:16:59.380]  So you've got people that walked in under their own horsepower that are suddenly being
[02:16:59.380 --> 02:17:00.380]  placed on ventilators.
[02:17:00.380 --> 02:17:01.380]  Wait, what?
[02:17:01.380 --> 02:17:02.860]  I mean, that's life support.
[02:17:02.860 --> 02:17:04.340]  That's what you do for somebody who's dying.
[02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:08.580]  I mean, that's a tragic car accident, something that there's just no way that this person
[02:17:08.580 --> 02:17:09.580]  can make it back.
[02:17:09.580 --> 02:17:12.779]  You put them on life support and then allow families to come and say goodbye to them.
[02:17:12.779 --> 02:17:15.660]  But we separated them from their families.
[02:17:15.660 --> 02:17:16.820]  Why did we do that?
[02:17:16.820 --> 02:17:18.940]  Why did we give them toxic remdesivir?
[02:17:18.940 --> 02:17:24.380]  Why was that the only treatment that was acceptable from the NIH to give people even after this
[02:17:24.380 --> 02:17:25.380]  thing was kicked out?
[02:17:25.380 --> 02:17:29.860]  But what you said about the AI program directing the key hospitals that kill people, that's
[02:17:29.860 --> 02:17:30.860]  true.
[02:17:30.860 --> 02:17:33.539]  We think of a Terminator coming to kill us like the old Schwarzenegger movie, or we think
[02:17:33.539 --> 02:17:37.460]  of the Daleks in Doctor Who exterminate, exterminate.
[02:17:37.460 --> 02:17:41.940]  No, it kills you by turning off your resources, by directing bad medical care.
[02:17:41.940 --> 02:17:42.940]  That's how it does it.
[02:17:42.940 --> 02:17:44.619]  It doesn't go around saying it's going to kill you.
[02:17:44.619 --> 02:17:46.740]  It just kills you quietly.
[02:17:47.420 --> 02:17:50.740]  How much of Q drops were AI?
[02:17:50.740 --> 02:17:55.820]  How much of what we see from responses on Twitter or comments on Telegram or anywhere
[02:17:55.820 --> 02:17:59.660]  on social media, how much of that is AI and who's controlling it?
[02:17:59.660 --> 02:18:04.199]  Bill Gates has 49% ownership in the leading company developing artificial intelligence
[02:18:04.199 --> 02:18:06.140]  that will lead the future.
[02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:12.020]  And you teased out Yuval Noah Harari, this guy talking about controlling a whole lot
[02:18:12.020 --> 02:18:14.500]  more than just comments on Twitter.
[02:18:14.500 --> 02:18:15.500]  Who cares?
[02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:22.220]  We literally had people sitting around waiting for a savior to come based on drops that we
[02:18:22.220 --> 02:18:26.539]  attributed to some white hats that were, you know, in the Pentagon.
[02:18:26.539 --> 02:18:29.020]  Let me give you the floor on this because I love everything you're bringing up and I'm
[02:18:29.020 --> 02:18:30.340]  bad at interrupting.
[02:18:30.340 --> 02:18:31.340]  Start over.
[02:18:31.340 --> 02:18:36.779]  You did a great commentary on your show that I saw and tweets about Q and where it's going
[02:18:36.779 --> 02:18:39.420]  and what Yuval Noah Harari said.
[02:18:39.420 --> 02:18:43.020]  So go ahead and get into Q, get into all that, and when you're ready, tell them to play the
[02:18:43.020 --> 02:18:44.020]  clip.
[02:18:44.020 --> 02:18:45.020]  We'll play the clip.
[02:18:45.539 --> 02:18:49.460]  Yeah, the whole point of Q was your savior will save you and that your savior was a man.
[02:18:49.460 --> 02:18:53.260]  They had all of us worshiping a man.
[02:18:53.260 --> 02:18:57.020]  And through 2020, when people were isolated and locked down, human beings worldwide are
[02:18:57.020 --> 02:19:01.980]  being abused, victimized, shut away from their families, locked inside four walls, deprived
[02:19:01.980 --> 02:19:03.660]  of communities.
[02:19:03.660 --> 02:19:09.119]  Think about the satanic forces that work behind event 201 and the fake virus that no one has
[02:19:09.119 --> 02:19:11.600]  ever actually seen or isolated.
[02:19:11.600 --> 02:19:15.720]  So then they have to introduce a problem and then a reaction and then a solution.
[02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:19.039]  And that's what Q did, which was a government run operation.
[02:19:19.039 --> 02:19:25.199]  So the problem becomes the fake virus, the EcoHealth Alliance, Dr. Lieberman and his
[02:19:25.199 --> 02:19:28.220]  Lieber bots, Andrew Huff, the CIA.
[02:19:28.220 --> 02:19:30.880]  And so then you have step two, which is the reaction.
[02:19:30.880 --> 02:19:34.000]  Well, the reaction gets overlooked.
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:37.360]  This is this is where a lot of people don't really pay attention to.
[02:19:37.360 --> 02:19:39.480]  It's like the final solution that they have for you.
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:40.480]  But it's key.
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:42.480]  They have to create a demand.
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:43.980]  And that's exactly what the problem does.
[02:19:43.980 --> 02:19:48.940]  So when you think about the reaction and problem reaction solution, think about the demand
[02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:49.940]  that is created.
[02:19:49.940 --> 02:19:52.560]  This all goes back to Q. This all goes back to the virus.
[02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:54.760]  This all goes back to the Trump administration.
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:57.279]  And then ask yourself, is this really real?
[02:19:57.279 --> 02:20:03.119]  Is there really a demand for this thing that no one has ever heard of until this week?
[02:20:03.119 --> 02:20:04.760]  Do we really need it?
[02:20:04.760 --> 02:20:06.720]  But we're so easily manipulated.
[02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:08.880]  They tell us that we need a hole in our heads.
[02:20:08.880 --> 02:20:13.360]  They tell us to be pacified, to do absolutely nothing, that a man is riding in on a white
[02:20:13.360 --> 02:20:14.880]  horse to save this country.
[02:20:14.880 --> 02:20:16.800]  No, do not rise up.
[02:20:16.800 --> 02:20:19.199]  This oppressive government will take care of itself.
[02:20:19.199 --> 02:20:21.080]  The Constitution means nothing.
[02:20:21.080 --> 02:20:24.320]  Your inherent God-given inalienable rights, they'll be restored.
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:26.760]  Just wait, because there's all kinds of white hats.
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:28.400]  You know, these people have been executed.
[02:20:28.400 --> 02:20:29.720]  They've gone to Gitmo.
[02:20:29.720 --> 02:20:32.980]  There's secret operations being run all over the place.
[02:20:32.980 --> 02:20:34.640]  Trust the plan.
[02:20:34.640 --> 02:20:36.080]  Don't be the plan.
[02:20:36.080 --> 02:20:37.080]  Trust the plan.
[02:20:37.080 --> 02:20:42.320]  This is how they chilled patriotism and then set up January 6th in order to put people
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:45.880]  in jail and make the fear, put the fear of God into people.
[02:20:45.880 --> 02:20:49.920]  Don't you ever think about rising up against this tyrannical government that is ushering
[02:20:49.920 --> 02:20:56.080]  in full authoritarian rule, complete absence of the rule of law, which is the only recipe,
[02:20:56.080 --> 02:20:57.640]  you know, ingredient that is required.
[02:20:57.640 --> 02:21:02.600]  And don't forget that Q said that Biden would be removed on January 20th at the inauguration.
[02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:05.380]  And then that fear was used to put troops in the Capitol.
[02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:09.100]  So it's both used to manipulate the public and manipulate the military.
[02:21:09.100 --> 02:21:10.300]  We actually clamor for it.
[02:21:10.300 --> 02:21:11.300]  We beg for it.
[02:21:11.300 --> 02:21:15.140]  We demand a hole in our heads when they suggest that we might need one.
[02:21:15.140 --> 02:21:16.140]  Help me.
[02:21:16.140 --> 02:21:17.140]  Help me.
[02:21:17.140 --> 02:21:18.140]  Help me.
[02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:20.900]  You know, Brian Williams and Katie Couric tell me I need to onboard this bioweapon.
[02:21:20.900 --> 02:21:22.100]  I need to go inject myself.
[02:21:22.100 --> 02:21:24.900]  So I demand that you give it to me right now.
[02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:29.480]  I mean, they turned us into a bunch of Karens overnight.
[02:21:29.480 --> 02:21:30.820]  And then they have the solution.
[02:21:30.820 --> 02:21:31.820]  And what is the solution?
[02:21:32.140 --> 02:21:37.779]  Well, in the sense of the fake virus that nobody's ever isolated, it's the bioweapon.
[02:21:37.779 --> 02:21:41.660]  All of our other CIA friends that were hanging out in China just went ahead and rolled out
[02:21:41.660 --> 02:21:42.660]  the bioweapon.
[02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:44.220]  But guess what they did in China?
[02:21:44.220 --> 02:21:45.580]  They banned it.
[02:21:45.580 --> 02:21:50.220]  They banned Pfizer and Moderna's products that we here are still pushing on the Fox News
[02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:55.220]  channel as safe and effective vaccines, while Pfizer funds 85 percent of the media.
[02:21:55.220 --> 02:21:58.340]  These people are criminals and should be arrested immediately.
[02:21:58.340 --> 02:22:04.660]  But all of this comes back to a programming of Americans, a programming of world citizens
[02:22:04.660 --> 02:22:10.460]  that says that you need to do a certain thing or else you will die, or else your children
[02:22:10.460 --> 02:22:15.340]  will die, or else you will go to jail, or else you will be held without trial, or else
[02:22:15.340 --> 02:22:19.380]  without due process, you'll be put into a gulag and held like for two years.
[02:22:19.380 --> 02:22:20.380]  No, I totally agree.
[02:22:20.380 --> 02:22:22.020]  So let me let me raise this.
[02:22:22.020 --> 02:22:26.020]  They had the Ministry of Truth, the disinformation office that got shut down.
[02:22:26.020 --> 02:22:31.180]  Now it's back, run by the CIA under another name, countering foreign disinformation.
[02:22:31.180 --> 02:22:35.140]  Just another permutation of what Obama launched before he left office.
[02:22:35.140 --> 02:22:38.580]  They're saying they're going to run national TV ads saying don't trust white people.
[02:22:38.580 --> 02:22:39.580]  There's terrorists everywhere.
[02:22:39.580 --> 02:22:41.260]  I mean, this is their big move.
[02:22:41.260 --> 02:22:44.300]  I think clearly they're planning some really big stuff.
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:50.260]  Yeah, you see, and that's because they know that not everyone is going to want to go along
[02:22:50.260 --> 02:22:54.100]  with the artificial demands that they create.
[02:22:54.180 --> 02:22:57.300]  So when they have the problem, and then they have the reaction, and then they introduce
[02:22:57.300 --> 02:23:01.779]  the solution, and then they tell you just to sit back and relax and trust a plan, and
[02:23:01.779 --> 02:23:05.460]  the only source of trusted information should be your government and state-run television,
[02:23:05.460 --> 02:23:08.740]  and this guy's been kicked off, and he's a conspiracy theorist, and then you find out
[02:23:08.740 --> 02:23:12.220]  through people like Zach Voorhees, who worked over at Google, about all of the things that
[02:23:12.220 --> 02:23:16.900]  Google was doing and bringing in AI to make sure that they could reprogram the entire
[02:23:16.900 --> 02:23:22.100]  Internet so that your Google results and your news results were completely skewed, but were
[02:23:22.100 --> 02:23:27.300]  in alliance with the corporate values of Google, which I guarantee you are not in alliance
[02:23:27.300 --> 02:23:31.580]  and in league with the corporate values of you or the values of any American.
[02:23:31.580 --> 02:23:34.820]  The things that we're talking about at our dinner table, we're not able to even find
[02:23:34.820 --> 02:23:35.820]  on the Internet anymore.
[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:40.500]  Now, let me ask you this, if this was a football game, what quarter are we in?
[02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:41.500]  Are we losing?
[02:23:41.500 --> 02:23:42.500]  Are we winning?
[02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:43.500]  Or is it tied?
[02:23:43.500 --> 02:23:44.500]  Yeah, I know.
[02:23:44.500 --> 02:23:45.500]  And you've asked me that before.
[02:23:45.500 --> 02:23:49.699]  And I would tell you that, biblically speaking, we are in the fourth quarter.
[02:23:49.699 --> 02:23:51.779]  I mean, we are in the end times.
[02:23:51.779 --> 02:23:53.539]  There's nothing that we can do to stop what is coming.
[02:23:53.539 --> 02:23:55.779]  Jesus Christ is coming back.
[02:23:55.779 --> 02:23:59.520]  And we are seeing the deception that we were promised that we were going to see.
[02:23:59.520 --> 02:24:01.300]  We are seeing the trials and tribulations.
[02:24:01.300 --> 02:24:04.020]  I don't think that we have seen a fraction of the death that we're about to see.
[02:24:04.020 --> 02:24:09.220]  I think that things are going to get a lot tougher because, remember, we have to, everybody
[02:24:09.220 --> 02:24:10.900]  has to wake up.
[02:24:10.900 --> 02:24:16.020]  And if there is only a fraction or a small portion or which is now rapidly growing of
[02:24:16.020 --> 02:24:19.460]  people who are awake to what's happening around them.
[02:24:19.460 --> 02:24:23.900]  And those people have to still wake up, which is the majority of people, then it's going
[02:24:23.900 --> 02:24:24.900]  to take calamities.
[02:24:24.900 --> 02:24:28.300]  It's going to take major, major death, major destruction.
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:30.260]  And, you know, God said that it was coming.
[02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:35.100]  And so, I mean, obviously, he is the only source of truth that you can rely on 100 percent.
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:38.619]  I don't think there's any denial that we have, we are entering the end times.
[02:24:38.619 --> 02:24:42.779]  I mean, even if you don't believe in God, they took that and made it a battle plan.
[02:24:42.779 --> 02:24:47.260]  We are literally entering into one world government, one world currency, taking over
[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:50.140]  our bodies, destroying our families, mass death.
[02:24:50.140 --> 02:24:53.420]  I mean, there's no doubt that hell has been released.
[02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:54.420]  Yeah.
[02:24:54.420 --> 02:25:01.500]  And so but if you think about this now, they know that they can't force everyone to comply.
[02:25:01.500 --> 02:25:06.699]  These people in this hijacked government, which I think the whole damn thing is fake.
[02:25:06.699 --> 02:25:07.940]  I don't trust any of them.
[02:25:07.940 --> 02:25:09.460]  I don't believe in any of them.
[02:25:09.460 --> 02:25:11.619]  None of them are doing the bidding of the people.
[02:25:11.619 --> 02:25:15.020]  None of them represent the Constitutional Republic or a two party system.
[02:25:15.020 --> 02:25:16.020]  I think it's all fake.
[02:25:16.020 --> 02:25:17.699]  It's 100 percent fake.
[02:25:17.699 --> 02:25:19.619]  But they know that they can't get people to comply.
[02:25:19.619 --> 02:25:21.420]  So they have this whole set of people who won't comply.
[02:25:21.420 --> 02:25:25.380]  So the question that they have to answer for themselves, you know, the Committee of 300,
[02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:29.619]  the World Chamber of Commerce, the World Economic Forum, the World Health Organization, the
[02:25:29.619 --> 02:25:31.860]  global oligarchs, whatever we want to call them.
[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:34.500]  The question that we have to answer is this.
[02:25:34.500 --> 02:25:41.939]  How do we neutralize these noncompliant, mule headed, sovereign citizens?
[02:25:41.939 --> 02:25:44.380]  What will they bring to us?
[02:25:44.380 --> 02:25:46.660]  How do we silence them?
[02:25:46.660 --> 02:25:49.539]  How do we demobilize them?
[02:25:49.539 --> 02:25:51.300]  How do we stop them?
[02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:55.779]  Well, we know that part of the answer to that question is they try to use the rhetoric to
[02:25:55.779 --> 02:25:56.779]  marginalize us.
[02:25:56.779 --> 02:26:01.300]  So for the last eight years now, we've all been called racists and bigots and homophobes
[02:26:01.300 --> 02:26:06.460]  and transphobes and dangerous extremists and purveyors of mis and disinformation.
[02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:08.400]  But the backlash to that has been strong.
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:09.699]  So that's really promising to me.
[02:26:09.699 --> 02:26:13.300]  So if you ask if we're winning or losing, I think that in the fourth quarter, we're actually
[02:26:13.420 --> 02:26:16.340]  winning because the backlash to this is so strong.
[02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:20.580]  I mean, we're seeing dozens of states now that are getting on board with banning puberty
[02:26:20.580 --> 02:26:26.460]  blockers so that the dissent to the trans agenda is really is really rising as well.
[02:26:26.460 --> 02:26:30.100]  So calling someone a racist now is a joke or a transphobe is a joke.
[02:26:30.100 --> 02:26:31.020]  It has been for some time.
[02:26:31.020 --> 02:26:34.580]  I was about to say the answer is not caring what they call us and just move forward.
[02:26:34.580 --> 02:26:36.060]  And whatever they say, we do the opposite.
[02:26:37.420 --> 02:26:40.340]  Yeah, you'd be completely ungovernable, 100 percent.
[02:26:40.340 --> 02:26:45.060]  So there's this whole chunk of society who's basically immune to being called names, right,
[02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:46.420]  as you suggest.
[02:26:46.420 --> 02:26:51.060]  And now it's the same folks who most of them refuse to onboard this bioweapon or inject
[02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:56.580]  themselves or accept the edicts of, you know, an illegitimate pedophile in the White House.
[02:26:56.580 --> 02:27:00.779]  As my good friend said when she was campaigning, Candace Taylor for governor in Georgia, I
[02:27:00.779 --> 02:27:02.460]  thought that was brilliantly stated.
[02:27:02.460 --> 02:27:04.580]  So now they need to pacify those people.
[02:27:04.580 --> 02:27:07.840]  And the last thing that they want to do or the last thing that they want to see is these
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:09.779]  people get organized.
[02:27:09.779 --> 02:27:16.619]  And then once they're organized to get active, that would be completely destructive to the
[02:27:16.619 --> 02:27:21.820]  entire deep state cabal that is running roughshod on our country right now is if the majority
[02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:25.619]  of the people who were awake actually got organized and then got active.
[02:27:25.619 --> 02:27:31.240]  So they have to develop this whole playbook, which basically is disaggregation initiatives.
[02:27:31.240 --> 02:27:33.779]  They need to keep us divided amongst ourselves.
[02:27:33.779 --> 02:27:38.300]  They need the veterans and the military to look at the sovereign citizens with suspicion.
[02:27:38.300 --> 02:27:43.020]  They need law enforcement to see the true oath keepers as if they're domestic terrorists.
[02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:48.380]  They need to keep the Second Amendment activists on their heels with constant push for gun grabbing.
[02:27:48.380 --> 02:27:53.199]  They need to have the conservative and the populace and the Christians divided over whether
[02:27:53.199 --> 02:27:57.160]  so-called Christian nationalism is a good thing or a bad thing.
[02:27:57.160 --> 02:28:02.320]  They need to have, you know, America first Republicans divided with, you know, establishment
[02:28:02.320 --> 02:28:07.480]  fossils in the GOP and then, you know, rising firebrands like Marjorie Taylor Greene going
[02:28:07.480 --> 02:28:12.699]  to war with, you know, people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez when basically they're running
[02:28:12.699 --> 02:28:15.060]  the same role just on different sides of the aisle.
[02:28:15.060 --> 02:28:17.240]  I mean, the whole thing is a movie.
[02:28:17.240 --> 02:28:18.380]  It's all pro wrestling.
[02:28:18.380 --> 02:28:20.740]  It's all 100 percent freaking fake.
[02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:24.500]  And they need the school kids and their parents to stay reliant on schools.
[02:28:24.500 --> 02:28:32.439]  So they have homosexual kid grabbing, you know, trans promoting Fox News pundits telling people
[02:28:32.439 --> 02:28:36.180]  to save our school boards and go fight with your school boards.
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:38.279]  This is OK to be in your classroom.
[02:28:38.279 --> 02:28:39.279]  It's all divide and conquer.
[02:28:39.279 --> 02:28:41.720]  Stu Peters is on fire.
[02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:44.199]  At Real Stu Peters on Twitter and StuPeters.com.
[02:28:44.199 --> 02:28:47.039]  Alex Jones got a lot to cover on the other side.
[02:28:47.039 --> 02:28:48.039]  Stay with us.
[02:28:48.039 --> 02:28:58.640]  He's also a filmmaker.
[02:28:58.640 --> 02:29:01.220]  Please give me one minute of your time.
[02:29:01.220 --> 02:29:03.300]  Please write this down and please go look this up.
[02:29:03.300 --> 02:29:05.340]  It will change your life.
[02:29:05.340 --> 02:29:09.800]  The U.N. admits and the Lancet Medical Journal admits that upwards of two billion people
[02:29:09.800 --> 02:29:14.060]  have mental disabilities and declining cognitive abilities.
[02:29:14.060 --> 02:29:19.580]  The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine.
[02:29:19.580 --> 02:29:25.320]  Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it.
[02:29:25.320 --> 02:29:29.619]  Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells.
[02:29:29.619 --> 02:29:35.900]  And InfoWarsTore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full
[02:29:35.900 --> 02:29:36.900]  effect.
[02:29:36.900 --> 02:29:39.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has been sold out for six months.
[02:29:39.740 --> 02:29:42.660]  It's very hard to produce and it's finally back in stock.
[02:29:42.660 --> 02:29:45.720]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[02:29:45.720 --> 02:29:47.900]  This ladies and gentlemen is powerful.
[02:29:47.900 --> 02:29:49.220]  You and your family need it.
[02:29:49.220 --> 02:29:51.420]  It's 25 percent off back in stock.
[02:29:51.420 --> 02:29:55.740]  X3 tri iodine exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:29:55.740 --> 02:29:56.740]  Take action now.
[02:29:56.740 --> 02:29:58.260]  But regardless, research is info.
[02:29:58.300 --> 02:30:04.100]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth.
[02:30:04.100 --> 02:30:06.820]  And they've got our children drinking that.
[02:30:06.820 --> 02:30:12.539]  This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your family.
[02:30:12.539 --> 02:30:17.539]  We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patriot Supply Ready Hour group.
[02:30:17.539 --> 02:30:20.820]  It's been around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six.
[02:30:20.820 --> 02:30:25.180]  They went out, hired engineers, reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there
[02:30:25.180 --> 02:30:30.380]  that sells for twice the price, and they made it as good in all the studies.
[02:30:30.380 --> 02:30:34.060]  It reduces things to non-detectable levels, thousands of chemicals, but you can go pay
[02:30:34.060 --> 02:30:35.060]  two or three times.
[02:30:35.060 --> 02:30:37.939]  There's four or five other filters out there that are just as good.
[02:30:37.939 --> 02:30:42.180]  We sell the very best, highest grade water filtration system for half the price of the
[02:30:42.180 --> 02:30:47.820]  leading competitor, and the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you should
[02:30:47.820 --> 02:30:48.820]  filter your water.
[02:30:48.820 --> 02:30:50.340]  You should also filter your shower water.
[02:30:50.340 --> 02:30:53.380]  That's another way you absorb this crap, but I'm done talking about that.
[02:30:53.380 --> 02:30:57.500]  The point is you get the filters at InfoWarsTore.com, they're discounted right now, finally back
[02:30:57.500 --> 02:30:58.500]  in stock.
[02:30:58.500 --> 02:31:03.340]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months, and it's Turbo Force Plus.
[02:31:03.340 --> 02:31:05.500]  We made it even stronger.
[02:31:05.500 --> 02:31:11.060]  The strongest long-term energy you're going to find anywhere, Turbo Force is back in stock
[02:31:11.060 --> 02:31:16.140]  at InfoWarsTore.com or 888-253-3139.
[02:31:16.140 --> 02:31:22.660]  It's not just wide spectrum natural herbs that time release over 10 hours, should be
[02:31:22.660 --> 02:31:24.260]  called 10-hour energy.
[02:31:24.260 --> 02:31:29.699]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things and amino acids
[02:31:29.699 --> 02:31:34.580]  that turbo charge everything and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver, you
[02:31:34.580 --> 02:31:35.580]  name it.
[02:31:35.580 --> 02:31:39.300]  It is the super fuel.
[02:31:39.300 --> 02:31:42.660]  RainForce Plus is great, RainForce Ultra is great, they're two different nootropics, they
[02:31:42.660 --> 02:31:46.619]  go good with this, but this is the king Kong.
[02:31:46.619 --> 02:31:48.020]  This is the boss.
[02:31:48.020 --> 02:31:52.020]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, InfoWarsTore.com.
[02:31:52.020 --> 02:31:55.380]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:25.779]  Back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[02:32:25.779 --> 02:32:31.300]  I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the InfoWars
[02:32:31.300 --> 02:32:32.300]  team.
[02:32:32.300 --> 02:32:37.619]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to get these types of clips, because Alex's
[02:32:37.619 --> 02:32:42.900]  whole mentality was, go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[02:32:42.900 --> 02:32:47.300]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity, I'm just addicted to telling the truth and
[02:32:47.300 --> 02:32:51.900]  helping the American people, and I really do credit Alex for really instilling that
[02:32:51.900 --> 02:32:53.980]  within me early on in my career.
[02:33:06.900 --> 02:33:22.420]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the
[02:33:22.420 --> 02:33:23.420]  front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:33:23.420 --> 02:33:24.420]  You know, I really like Stu Peters.
[02:33:24.420 --> 02:33:36.660]  He's been coming on the show for years, and I think he does a great job.
[02:33:36.660 --> 02:33:39.060]  I love the work he does.
[02:33:39.060 --> 02:33:42.580]  And I get what he's saying about, at this point, he sees it all staged.
[02:33:42.580 --> 02:33:46.420]  Well, that's a healthy way to see it, because most of it is staged.
[02:33:46.420 --> 02:33:48.140]  But people say Stu Peters is an operative.
[02:33:48.140 --> 02:33:49.460]  I don't think he is.
[02:33:49.460 --> 02:33:50.460]  They say I'm an operative.
[02:33:50.460 --> 02:33:52.900]  I'm an operative of freedom.
[02:33:52.900 --> 02:33:54.020]  There are good people.
[02:33:54.020 --> 02:33:59.260]  There may be good people that are unwittingly tied into agendas, but I really see us waking
[02:33:59.260 --> 02:34:00.260]  up.
[02:34:00.260 --> 02:34:01.260]  Now, I don't trust Elon Musk.
[02:34:01.260 --> 02:34:02.260]  Let me ask you this question.
[02:34:02.260 --> 02:34:03.260]  I'm disagreeing with you.
[02:34:03.260 --> 02:34:07.940]  I'm just saying it's a very subtle thing.
[02:34:07.940 --> 02:34:09.020]  I don't trust him.
[02:34:09.020 --> 02:34:13.380]  He's involved in the lower satellites and the self-driving cars, the electric cars and
[02:34:13.380 --> 02:34:18.100]  brain chips and all of it, but I can't disagree with the devastating things he's saying against
[02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:23.020]  the New World Order and coming out against George Soros, but then he puts a WEF task
[02:34:23.020 --> 02:34:25.060]  force person in over the company.
[02:34:25.060 --> 02:34:28.060]  But if you look at the weight of it, overall, he's starting to do more good than bad.
[02:34:28.060 --> 02:34:32.380]  Now, does he see liberty winning, and he's hedging his bets, or is it a deeper psyop?
[02:34:32.500 --> 02:34:35.699]  I mean, I think that's the way to look at this.
[02:34:35.699 --> 02:34:39.619]  If it's all staged, I mean, well, that means we're staged, but I mean, I don't think that's...
[02:34:39.619 --> 02:34:43.900]  I think that's probably an overstatement, but I think you say in the main, it's staged.
[02:34:43.900 --> 02:34:44.980]  I would agree with that.
[02:34:44.980 --> 02:34:47.900]  But what do you think of Elon Musk?
[02:34:47.900 --> 02:34:54.119]  I mean, it's really hard to trust a person who wants to implant chips into everyone's
[02:34:54.119 --> 02:34:59.220]  brains and then control their actions and their thoughts and, you know, to control their
[02:34:59.220 --> 02:35:06.580]  dreams and to predict their futures and, you know, to essentially recreate the creation
[02:35:06.580 --> 02:35:12.340]  of God, you know, and us created in God's image and in the likeness of God.
[02:35:12.340 --> 02:35:19.060]  No, I don't trust Elon, and, you know, I don't really know why he's saying the things that
[02:35:19.060 --> 02:35:20.060]  he's saying.
[02:35:20.060 --> 02:35:23.460]  I don't live in his head, and I don't really know what drives him.
[02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:28.740]  But what I do know is that we have to judge people based upon their fruit.
[02:35:28.740 --> 02:35:29.740]  What have they done?
[02:35:29.740 --> 02:35:34.580]  When you hear people call me an operative, okay, well, where's your Died Suddenly film
[02:35:34.580 --> 02:35:38.779]  that's been seen 100 million times, that saved millions of lives, that, you know, is responsible
[02:35:38.779 --> 02:35:41.859]  for ending a military mandate for these bioweapon shots, you know?
[02:35:41.859 --> 02:35:46.060]  Well, yeah, if they have any discernment, they know that Stu Peters is not an operative.
[02:35:46.060 --> 02:35:47.060]  Exactly.
[02:35:47.060 --> 02:35:51.580]  You look at the fruits, you're the opposite of an operative of the enemy.
[02:35:51.580 --> 02:35:55.039]  So but what I'm saying is, how do you respond?
[02:35:55.039 --> 02:35:59.400]  Because we can sit there and say, when you say it's all staged, I think the prime directives
[02:35:59.400 --> 02:36:04.760]  are unified fraud, but I think all of us get manipulated to a certain extent.
[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:10.720]  Maybe you're manipulated 2%, I'm manipulated 3%, other people are manipulated 80%.
[02:36:10.720 --> 02:36:14.600]  The more awake we are, the less we're manipulated, but part of being human is we're fallible.
[02:36:14.600 --> 02:36:19.000]  So maybe an MTG's manipulated 20%, but she means well, you know what I mean?
[02:36:19.000 --> 02:36:22.240]  When you say it's all staged, how do you quantify that?
[02:36:23.240 --> 02:36:29.240]  Well, I guess when I say it's all staged, what I mean is the whole process of our government,
[02:36:29.240 --> 02:36:32.119]  the whole representative two-party system.
[02:36:32.119 --> 02:36:33.119]  What happened there?
[02:36:33.119 --> 02:36:34.119]  Did I go away?
[02:36:34.119 --> 02:36:35.119]  It's all right.
[02:36:35.119 --> 02:36:36.119]  I'll get you back.
[02:36:36.119 --> 02:36:37.119]  Keep going.
[02:36:37.119 --> 02:36:38.119]  Yeah.
[02:36:38.119 --> 02:36:40.320]  So I mean, the whole representative two-party system, the whole constitutional republic,
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:44.160]  the idea of voting itself is completely fake.
[02:36:44.160 --> 02:36:49.500]  You know, the whole premise of elections, the whole premise of Republicans are going to war
[02:36:49.500 --> 02:36:52.060]  with this guy and Democrats are, you know, really pushing back.
[02:36:52.060 --> 02:36:53.060]  No, I totally agree.
[02:36:53.060 --> 02:36:54.980]  The Republicans are soft playing it.
[02:36:54.980 --> 02:36:56.340]  They're not really winning.
[02:36:56.340 --> 02:36:57.340]  They're rolling over.
[02:36:57.340 --> 02:36:58.340]  They're pretending.
[02:36:58.340 --> 02:37:01.820]  So what you're saying is the social contract is broken and the main talking points are
[02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:02.820]  100% staged.
[02:37:02.820 --> 02:37:03.820]  I agree.
[02:37:03.820 --> 02:37:05.619]  The political process, it's all theater.
[02:37:05.619 --> 02:37:12.500]  I mean, you know, you have to actually lend some credence and some value to what you see
[02:37:12.500 --> 02:37:14.380]  right before your eyes.
[02:37:14.380 --> 02:37:19.460]  You can't be gaslit into believing that what your eyes are seeing are not really real.
[02:37:20.420 --> 02:37:24.140]  So when I'm looking at Twitter and I just posted this a few minutes ago, when I see
[02:37:24.140 --> 02:37:30.580]  that there are, you know, earlobe differences in this guy or that guy, or when I watch an
[02:37:30.580 --> 02:37:35.260]  NFL football player die suddenly on a football field and he needs to be resuscitated, but
[02:37:35.260 --> 02:37:36.779]  then they're telling me that he did not die.
[02:37:36.779 --> 02:37:39.539]  Well, but if he didn't die, then why does he need life-saving CPR?
[02:37:39.539 --> 02:37:44.060]  Or the shooter in Tennessee was wearing two different pairs of shoes.
[02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:45.060]  You have to.
[02:37:45.060 --> 02:37:46.060]  I mean, yes.
[02:37:46.060 --> 02:37:47.300]  And so don't gaslight me.
[02:37:47.300 --> 02:37:48.779]  No, no, I agree.
[02:37:48.779 --> 02:37:51.020]  We shouldn't believe anything upfront.
[02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:54.340]  We should always approach everything as if it's fraud.
[02:37:54.340 --> 02:37:56.340]  I agree with that statement.
[02:37:56.340 --> 02:38:01.340]  And I think that the actions that they are trying to take, it's not easy to overthrow
[02:38:01.340 --> 02:38:02.340]  a superpower.
[02:38:02.340 --> 02:38:10.460]  It's not easy to take over a country where there are 450 million documented firearms and,
[02:38:10.460 --> 02:38:14.500]  you know, that these people, you know, ostensibly should not at least be giving up their guns.
[02:38:14.500 --> 02:38:19.060]  But I don't even know anymore because the American public has become so soft and pussified
[02:38:19.060 --> 02:38:24.340]  and manipulatable that they will just go along with anything that these elite oligarchs tell
[02:38:24.340 --> 02:38:25.580]  them to do.
[02:38:25.580 --> 02:38:26.580]  And so I don't know.
[02:38:26.580 --> 02:38:27.940]  Maybe they will all give up their guns.
[02:38:27.940 --> 02:38:32.980]  And if we give up, if we give up even an inch on Amendment 2, if we allow these, you know,
[02:38:32.980 --> 02:38:36.619]  now we see the Supreme Court is upholding an assault weapons ban.
[02:38:36.619 --> 02:38:37.619]  I mean, assault weapon.
[02:38:37.619 --> 02:38:38.619]  What the hell is that?
[02:38:38.619 --> 02:38:42.020]  That's a fictitious class of firearms that doesn't even exist.
[02:38:42.020 --> 02:38:45.699]  We don't have assault weapons in the hands of Americans.
[02:38:45.699 --> 02:38:49.900]  I mean, and by the way, I don't want to waste your time playing the Obama clip, but he did
[02:38:49.900 --> 02:38:52.420]  call for Australian style gun confiscation.
[02:38:52.420 --> 02:38:58.220]  That's quite a quite a road marker to pass.
[02:38:58.220 --> 02:38:59.220]  Yeah.
[02:38:59.220 --> 02:39:05.900]  And so they in order to do that, in order to to achieve that amazing feat of overthrowing
[02:39:05.900 --> 02:39:09.260]  this country, which I mean, I believe that they are well on their way of doing that.
[02:39:09.260 --> 02:39:13.580]  I don't think that there's any argument to that, but they but they need to.
[02:39:13.580 --> 02:39:16.420]  As you mentioned before the break, it's about divide and conquer.
[02:39:16.420 --> 02:39:19.420]  They need to keep us divided over our tactics.
[02:39:19.420 --> 02:39:24.340]  And in other words, how are we going to take back our nation?
[02:39:24.340 --> 02:39:27.100]  So they want us at each other's throats, right?
[02:39:27.100 --> 02:39:32.619]  They want us feuding over this strategic decision or that strategic decision.
[02:39:32.619 --> 02:39:36.940]  Or, you know, is this guy controlled opposition or is he really leading the charge?
[02:39:36.940 --> 02:39:37.940]  Is he really a good guy?
[02:39:37.940 --> 02:39:43.300]  And most of all, if they can keep the list of potentially active sovereign citizens as
[02:39:43.300 --> 02:39:49.539]  small as they can possibly keep it so much better for Pfizer and Albert Bourla, so much
[02:39:49.539 --> 02:39:54.859]  better for Microsoft and Bill Gates, so much better for Moderna and Boeing, so much better
[02:39:54.859 --> 02:40:00.100]  for, you know, the banksters and the criminal central banking cabal and, you know, the finance
[02:40:00.100 --> 02:40:01.100]  good.
[02:40:01.100 --> 02:40:02.100]  I totally agree.
[02:40:02.100 --> 02:40:05.539]  So what do you I mean, I know what their end game is, but everybody has a perspective.
[02:40:05.539 --> 02:40:09.420]  When they had their druthers and we all just rolled over, what is the new and older end
[02:40:09.420 --> 02:40:10.420]  game?
[02:40:10.420 --> 02:40:20.380]  Just it's a complete world subservient class that can be, you know, isolated to their 15
[02:40:20.380 --> 02:40:24.500]  minute cities and live in their pods and eat their bugs and be controllable.
[02:40:24.500 --> 02:40:30.660]  And anybody who pretends that they're, you know, unhappy or speaks out against against
[02:40:30.660 --> 02:40:34.539]  that can be, you know, kill switched because they've been implanted and they can just
[02:40:34.539 --> 02:40:35.619]  look like the matrix.
[02:40:35.619 --> 02:40:36.619]  Just be unplugged.
[02:40:36.619 --> 02:40:37.619]  That's it.
[02:40:37.619 --> 02:40:40.699]  The real end game is the central bank digital currency, the global social credit score,
[02:40:40.699 --> 02:40:41.820]  the universal basic income.
[02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:42.820]  They get that.
[02:40:42.820 --> 02:40:44.300]  It's all over.
[02:40:44.300 --> 02:40:50.539]  And going back to Q, in order to keep the group small of really active dissenting people,
[02:40:50.539 --> 02:40:54.180]  they keep the plan trusters sitting on their hands.
[02:40:54.180 --> 02:40:56.580]  Wait for the next Durham report.
[02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:59.660]  Wait and don't you love how the Q thing has crawled back up out of the ashes?
[02:40:59.660 --> 02:41:02.100]  I mean, it is so pathetic.
[02:41:02.100 --> 02:41:03.100]  It's pathetic.
[02:41:03.100 --> 02:41:06.060]  The fact that people go along with this is just absolutely mind numbing.
[02:41:06.060 --> 02:41:08.680]  It's depressing to watch your story.
[02:41:08.680 --> 02:41:13.140]  About four years ago, Trump had called me in the morning and I talked to him and warned
[02:41:13.140 --> 02:41:14.740]  him about stuff.
[02:41:14.740 --> 02:41:19.060]  And then at afternoon, I went down to the Texas Capitol for a rally.
[02:41:19.060 --> 02:41:21.260]  And I forgot what the rally was.
[02:41:21.260 --> 02:41:24.460]  And a bunch of people were in Q shirts that came over and they said, we used to like you,
[02:41:24.460 --> 02:41:30.500]  but now we know Q doesn't like you and we know Trump's Q and we're with Q. And I said,
[02:41:30.500 --> 02:41:31.500]  do you understand?
[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:32.500]  I'm a known person.
[02:41:32.900 --> 02:41:36.420]  I just talked to the president this morning and they all laughed at me like I'm a real
[02:41:36.420 --> 02:41:37.940]  person decades on air.
[02:41:37.940 --> 02:41:42.140]  I talked to the president that morning and they laughed at me and said, Q says you're
[02:41:42.140 --> 02:41:43.140]  bad.
[02:41:43.140 --> 02:41:44.980]  I mean, you talk about mind control.
[02:41:44.980 --> 02:41:47.060]  This was insane.
[02:41:47.060 --> 02:41:55.460]  This is a non real thing that nobody can identify telling these people to, to, to trust this
[02:41:55.460 --> 02:41:59.699]  plan and to believe in a man being their savior.
[02:41:59.699 --> 02:42:00.699]  And think about that.
[02:42:00.699 --> 02:42:02.860]  You are in the flesh and blood.
[02:42:02.860 --> 02:42:05.140]  Very well known person on the air.
[02:42:05.140 --> 02:42:08.580]  Like you said, for decades, everybody knows that they can, they can touch you.
[02:42:08.580 --> 02:42:09.779]  They can hug you.
[02:42:09.779 --> 02:42:14.699]  They can physically threaten you in the case of Marco Rubio.
[02:42:14.699 --> 02:42:19.420]  But you know, I mean, there's these people laughing at you and likely not believing you
[02:42:19.420 --> 02:42:22.500]  that you talked, you know, to the president that morning.
[02:42:22.500 --> 02:42:29.180]  And so now here we are waiting on what we're waiting on another Durham 2.0, the DOJ to finally
[02:42:29.300 --> 02:42:35.220]  indict Hunter Biden and Joe and Joe's brother for their China and Ukraine and Burisma scams
[02:42:35.220 --> 02:42:36.220]  or pedophilia.
[02:42:36.220 --> 02:42:41.380]  I mean, remember, we were always just on the precipice, always just on the brink of being
[02:42:41.380 --> 02:42:42.380]  saved.
[02:42:42.380 --> 02:42:48.860]  Thousands of them out, they're going to drop or the army of Trump's white hats in the Pentagon.
[02:42:48.860 --> 02:42:51.020]  They're embedded there and we're just waiting for them.
[02:42:51.020 --> 02:42:55.660]  And now with the very real possibility that Trump could well return to the White House,
[02:42:55.660 --> 02:43:01.500]  how many of these plan trusters will continue to be abused by the claims that they were
[02:43:01.500 --> 02:43:03.060]  ever going to see remedy?
[02:43:03.060 --> 02:43:04.060]  And let's expand on that.
[02:43:04.060 --> 02:43:05.500]  You raised a point that I'd never thought of.
[02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:07.980]  It's an original thought.
[02:43:07.980 --> 02:43:12.820]  Just like the liberals trust their leftist plan are being destroyed.
[02:43:12.820 --> 02:43:18.380]  The right wing, I mean, about a third of them literally sat on their thumbs or their thumbs
[02:43:18.380 --> 02:43:21.820]  up their rear ends, believing everything was handled because they couldn't handle the stress
[02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:23.820]  of we're getting our fricking asses kicked.
[02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:28.100]  If I was in a fight, somebody's pounding me in the face and I go, oh, an angel is going
[02:43:28.100 --> 02:43:29.100]  to save me.
[02:43:29.100 --> 02:43:30.100]  I'm going to die.
[02:43:30.100 --> 02:43:32.460]  But if I know God gave me this body to fight back, I'm going to win.
[02:43:32.460 --> 02:43:33.460]  And exactly.
[02:43:33.460 --> 02:43:35.460]  It's the perfect way to neutralize people.
[02:43:35.460 --> 02:43:36.460]  And I was warning.
[02:43:36.460 --> 02:43:37.460]  They're going to steal the election.
[02:43:37.460 --> 02:43:38.460]  They're going to take over.
[02:43:38.460 --> 02:43:39.460]  Everybody's got to get involved.
[02:43:39.460 --> 02:43:40.460]  Shut up, Jones.
[02:43:40.460 --> 02:43:46.500]  You're not Q. And it was like you're sitting there like watching the mind control.
[02:43:46.500 --> 02:43:48.300]  It's so sad.
[02:43:48.300 --> 02:43:52.140]  Yeah, just just chill.
[02:43:52.140 --> 02:43:54.420]  Everything is going to be taken care of.
[02:43:54.420 --> 02:43:57.860]  This is the only way that you take a nation.
[02:43:57.860 --> 02:43:59.260]  You introduce a virus, right?
[02:43:59.260 --> 02:44:00.340]  You lock everybody down.
[02:44:00.340 --> 02:44:01.340]  You force them to shots.
[02:44:01.340 --> 02:44:02.860]  You scare the hell out of everybody.
[02:44:02.860 --> 02:44:03.860]  You isolate them.
[02:44:03.860 --> 02:44:04.860]  You take them away from their families.
[02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:06.119]  You kill their families.
[02:44:06.119 --> 02:44:07.800]  You introduce economic chaos.
[02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:13.500]  You have, you know, this this fake candidate like locked in his basement and wearing masks
[02:44:13.500 --> 02:44:18.220]  and 13 people are at his things and your kids are being taken out of school and you're losing
[02:44:18.220 --> 02:44:19.220]  your job.
[02:44:19.300 --> 02:44:23.900]  It's confusing, you know, to get this shot and, you know, people are just it's just constant
[02:44:23.900 --> 02:44:24.900]  chaos.
[02:44:24.900 --> 02:44:25.900]  So let me raise that next.
[02:44:25.900 --> 02:44:26.900]  What do you really think of Trump?
[02:44:26.900 --> 02:44:29.260]  I think Trump is flawed.
[02:44:29.260 --> 02:44:30.260]  I think he's pigheaded.
[02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:31.260]  But that's why they hate him.
[02:44:31.260 --> 02:44:32.260]  They control him.
[02:44:32.260 --> 02:44:35.779]  But overall, they did all that to take out Trump.
[02:44:35.779 --> 02:44:38.980]  They pulled that thing on the shelf off.
[02:44:38.980 --> 02:44:40.260]  So that's my view of Trump.
[02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:42.619]  I think Trump is a failed vessel.
[02:44:42.619 --> 02:44:43.619]  But we all are.
[02:44:43.619 --> 02:44:44.619]  But I overall think Trump is good.
[02:44:44.619 --> 02:44:45.619]  What?
[02:44:45.619 --> 02:44:46.619]  Be honest.
[02:44:46.619 --> 02:44:47.619]  What do you think of Trump?
[02:44:47.619 --> 02:44:48.619]  I respect your opinion.
[02:44:48.619 --> 02:44:53.619]  I honestly can't support anybody that's continuing to advocate for and push for people poisoning
[02:44:53.619 --> 02:44:55.580]  themselves with weapons of biowarfare.
[02:44:55.580 --> 02:44:56.580]  I agree.
[02:44:56.580 --> 02:44:57.580]  I agree.
[02:44:57.580 --> 02:44:58.580]  So what do we what do we do?
[02:44:58.580 --> 02:44:59.580]  RFK?
[02:44:59.580 --> 02:45:04.340]  No, I mean, I disagree with RFK on so many levels just because of the fact that he's
[02:45:04.340 --> 02:45:08.500]  I mean, he's a liberal, he's a he's a staunch liberal and has liberal policies.
[02:45:08.500 --> 02:45:09.500]  I mean, I agree.
[02:45:09.500 --> 02:45:11.180]  So I don't believe in lesser of two evils.
[02:45:11.180 --> 02:45:12.180]  What do we do?
[02:45:12.180 --> 02:45:16.020]  I don't know, I'll run for president.
[02:45:16.020 --> 02:45:17.220]  All right.
[02:45:17.220 --> 02:45:18.220]  I'll support that.
[02:45:18.220 --> 02:45:23.100]  So I've been asking a lot of the questions at the time we have, we have 15 minutes left.
[02:45:23.100 --> 02:45:25.619]  Let me ask you this.
[02:45:25.619 --> 02:45:27.420]  What what's front and center on your radar?
[02:45:27.420 --> 02:45:32.420]  Because I got a thousand questions, but what else are you really focused on right now?
[02:45:32.420 --> 02:45:34.939]  I'm most concerned about AI right now.
[02:45:34.939 --> 02:45:41.020]  I mean, and being poisoned and people's mind control just escalating and people being
[02:45:41.020 --> 02:45:43.460]  I mean, they're addicted to these things.
[02:45:43.699 --> 02:45:48.220]  But wait a minute, you didn't see Drudge Report and MSNBC?
[02:45:48.220 --> 02:45:50.860]  The Bilderberg Group is going to save us from AIs.
[02:45:50.860 --> 02:45:53.600]  Yeah, I know.
[02:45:53.600 --> 02:45:59.500]  The actual manufacturers, the actual inventors, the actual programmers of AIs are so concerned
[02:45:59.500 --> 02:46:04.100]  about what AIs are going to do that they're saying now that it could be decades before
[02:46:04.100 --> 02:46:06.740]  we see anything good come out of AIs.
[02:46:06.740 --> 02:46:10.140]  But that what we're going to see now is that these people, these things I look at, I'm
[02:46:10.140 --> 02:46:11.539]  even calling them people.
[02:46:11.619 --> 02:46:16.100]  These AIs are going to be so human like that they're going to be undetectable.
[02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:20.140]  And if you can't if you can't detect them, then how can you combat them?
[02:46:20.140 --> 02:46:21.300]  How can you control them?
[02:46:21.300 --> 02:46:23.619]  Oh, I was two weeks ago.
[02:46:23.619 --> 02:46:26.980]  I'm in an accounting meeting and it says Tucker Carlson's phone number.
[02:46:26.980 --> 02:46:27.980]  So they spoofed the number.
[02:46:27.980 --> 02:46:29.699]  And I said, let me step out.
[02:46:29.699 --> 02:46:31.699]  And I just talked to Tucker a day before.
[02:46:31.699 --> 02:46:32.699]  So I think it's Tucker.
[02:46:32.699 --> 02:46:36.500]  And it's like, hey, I want to have sex with you, all this stuff.
[02:46:36.500 --> 02:46:37.500]  And I said, this isn't Tucker.
[02:46:37.500 --> 02:46:38.500]  It's AI.
[02:46:39.500 --> 02:46:44.939]  I mean, but just imagine someone can call up sounding like your mother and say, son,
[02:46:44.939 --> 02:46:46.699]  I forgot my bank account number.
[02:46:46.699 --> 02:46:48.460]  And then you give them the bank account number.
[02:46:48.460 --> 02:46:51.740]  I mean, this is dangerous.
[02:46:51.740 --> 02:46:52.740]  Even more so.
[02:46:52.740 --> 02:46:56.740]  I mean, at the top of the show, we talked about this Yuval Noel Harari.
[02:46:56.740 --> 02:46:57.740]  Oh, yeah.
[02:46:57.740 --> 02:46:58.740]  This guy.
[02:46:58.740 --> 02:46:59.740]  We've got the clip.
[02:46:59.740 --> 02:47:00.740]  Introduce it.
[02:47:00.740 --> 02:47:01.740]  Introduce it.
[02:47:01.740 --> 02:47:02.740]  OK.
[02:47:02.740 --> 02:47:03.740]  Look at this guy.
[02:47:03.740 --> 02:47:05.740]  He's saying, we will control your elections.
[02:47:05.980 --> 02:47:08.660]  There will be no need for you voters anymore.
[02:47:08.660 --> 02:47:09.980]  You have become so useless.
[02:47:09.980 --> 02:47:10.980]  You can't even vote.
[02:47:10.980 --> 02:47:11.980]  Here it is.
[02:47:11.980 --> 02:47:12.980]  Look at this guy.
[02:47:12.980 --> 02:47:20.939]  Imagine the impact of the new AI tools that can mass produce political manifestos, fake
[02:47:20.939 --> 02:47:26.779]  news stories, and even holy scriptures for new cults.
[02:47:26.779 --> 02:47:34.980]  In recent years, the politically influential QAnon cult has formed around anonymous online
[02:47:35.220 --> 02:47:38.220]  texts known as Q-drops.
[02:47:38.220 --> 02:47:44.220]  Now, followers of this cult, which are millions now in the US and the rest of the world, collected,
[02:47:44.220 --> 02:47:51.220]  revered, and interpreted these Q-drops as some kind of new scriptures, as a sacred text.
[02:47:51.220 --> 02:47:58.220]  Now, to the best of our knowledge, all previous Q-drops were composed by human beings.
[02:47:58.220 --> 02:48:04.220]  And bots only helped to disseminate these texts online.
[02:48:04.460 --> 02:48:13.460]  But in future, we might see the first cults and religions in history whose revered texts
[02:48:13.460 --> 02:48:17.460]  were written by a non-human intelligence.
[02:48:17.460 --> 02:48:23.460]  And of course, religions throughout history claimed that their holy books were written
[02:48:23.460 --> 02:48:25.460]  by a non-human intelligence.
[02:48:25.460 --> 02:48:27.460]  This was never true before.
[02:48:27.460 --> 02:48:30.460]  This could become true very, very quickly.
[02:48:30.460 --> 02:48:31.460]  Oh, it wasn't true before.
[02:48:31.460 --> 02:48:33.460]  So let's expand on that.
[02:48:33.699 --> 02:48:35.699]  I've got a key point I want you to give.
[02:48:35.699 --> 02:48:37.699]  Well, first, give me your take on this, and I've got my point.
[02:48:37.699 --> 02:48:39.699]  Well, I mean, he said it all.
[02:48:39.699 --> 02:48:42.699]  He said, we're going to rewrite scriptures.
[02:48:42.699 --> 02:48:48.699]  We're going to have AI that makes basically people into not only superhumans, but can
[02:48:48.699 --> 02:48:50.699]  actually turn them into gods.
[02:48:50.699 --> 02:48:52.699]  And this is what they envisioned.
[02:48:52.699 --> 02:48:57.699]  This is the eternal life that they think that they can create for themselves, aside from
[02:48:57.699 --> 02:49:01.699]  drinking the blood of young children that they abuse.
[02:49:01.939 --> 02:49:07.939]  This is really seriously an issue when you have a criminal openly telling you that they
[02:49:07.939 --> 02:49:14.939]  are going to hijack the rest of your life and remove the human existence completely
[02:49:14.939 --> 02:49:20.939]  in an extinction-level event that will be replaced by AI bots and robots.
[02:49:20.939 --> 02:49:23.939]  That is really shocking to listen to.
[02:49:24.939 --> 02:49:27.939]  You know, well, that guy is just crazy.
[02:49:28.180 --> 02:49:32.180]  Everything that this guy says, he fully intends on carrying out.
[02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:36.180]  Everything that these people say, the criminals are telling you what they have to do.
[02:49:36.180 --> 02:49:38.180]  It's part of their satanic religion.
[02:49:38.180 --> 02:49:41.180]  It's part of their devil horn worshiping that they have to tell you what their plan is.
[02:49:41.180 --> 02:49:46.180]  They have to telegraph and project and tell you what they're about to do to abuse and
[02:49:46.180 --> 02:49:50.180]  to kill you and to take your kids and to snatch them up and to bring them out.
[02:49:50.180 --> 02:49:53.180]  And why do you think they metaphysically stupider seem to do that?
[02:49:53.420 --> 02:49:58.420]  Well, I mean, that's what they're told that they have to do in order to honor their
[02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:01.420]  covenant with the devil, the real enemy, Satan.
[02:50:01.420 --> 02:50:03.420]  This is the evil that we're seeing.
[02:50:03.420 --> 02:50:06.420]  Exactly. God demands we have free will, so they have to be honest about it.
[02:50:06.420 --> 02:50:07.420]  So here's what I know.
[02:50:07.420 --> 02:50:10.420]  I'm on an AI computer, but I can see Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
[02:50:10.420 --> 02:50:11.420]  I can look at it.
[02:50:11.420 --> 02:50:16.420]  I remember at the Peek-A-Cube two years ago, two and a half years ago for the election.
[02:50:16.420 --> 02:50:20.420]  Everything that was real, everything that was serious, hey, we're in trouble.
[02:50:20.420 --> 02:50:21.420]  They're going to steal the election.
[02:50:21.660 --> 02:50:25.660]  Everything that would mobilize people was blocked to nothing.
[02:50:25.660 --> 02:50:28.660]  But all the Q idiots thought, oh, my God, we're great.
[02:50:28.660 --> 02:50:32.660]  Google and Facebook and Twitter were all boosting QTardism.
[02:50:32.660 --> 02:50:39.660]  Well, that's all my brain needed to know that it was a system because the establishment was boosting it.
[02:50:39.660 --> 02:50:41.660]  Brilliant deduction. Absolutely.
[02:50:41.660 --> 02:50:48.660]  And, you know, you have people from Google just telling you the whole plan for AI with
[02:50:48.900 --> 02:50:54.900]  Google has been executed already and is only growing more and more rapidly.
[02:50:54.900 --> 02:50:59.900]  It will be used at speeds that are just absolutely incomprehensible.
[02:50:59.900 --> 02:51:04.900]  You can't even comprehend the speed with which this AI is going to move.
[02:51:04.900 --> 02:51:11.900]  And anything that they deem to be when they program these AIs to be anti-American
[02:51:11.900 --> 02:51:16.900]  or anti-freedom or anti-individual liberty or anti-Christianity or anti-white
[02:51:17.140 --> 02:51:20.140]  or anti-Republican or anti-Trump or any...
[02:51:20.140 --> 02:51:23.140]  Even if you go out and have a rally and have a thousand people there,
[02:51:23.140 --> 02:51:26.140]  it will instantly block everything you're saying online.
[02:51:27.140 --> 02:51:28.140]  Everything that you're saying online.
[02:51:28.140 --> 02:51:29.140]  A hundred percent.
[02:51:29.140 --> 02:51:33.140]  They will remove any kind of organic support for anything.
[02:51:33.140 --> 02:51:38.140]  I was accused that the film Died Suddenly had inauthentic support on Twitter.
[02:51:38.140 --> 02:51:43.140]  The people at the BBC who I completely chewed up and spit out because they weren't ready for me.
[02:51:43.140 --> 02:51:44.140]  That's another key thing.
[02:51:44.380 --> 02:51:47.380]  They're worried about human disinfo and, oh, you're using bots,
[02:51:47.380 --> 02:51:49.380]  which you're not, when this whole thing is bot.
[02:51:49.380 --> 02:51:50.380]  Exactly.
[02:51:50.380 --> 02:51:54.380]  So they're suppressing human resistance while boosting AI takeover.
[02:51:55.380 --> 02:51:58.380]  And these are people who don't even believe in their own cause.
[02:51:58.380 --> 02:52:01.380]  These are people who don't even fight their own fight.
[02:52:01.380 --> 02:52:06.380]  Because, you know, you ask these people who have been pushers of the death jab
[02:52:06.380 --> 02:52:10.380]  for the last two years and relentlessly calling us purveyors of misinformation.
[02:52:10.380 --> 02:52:12.380]  They've labeled the disinformation dozen,
[02:52:12.619 --> 02:52:15.619]  which are credible doctors who are out here speaking out against all of this.
[02:52:15.619 --> 02:52:19.619]  And these people, you ask them themselves, well, are you vaccinated?
[02:52:19.619 --> 02:52:21.619]  And he goes, well, do you want an answer?
[02:52:21.619 --> 02:52:22.619]  This is on the BBC.
[02:52:22.619 --> 02:52:23.619]  Do you want an answer to that?
[02:52:23.619 --> 02:52:24.619]  Well, I'm not here to talk to myself.
[02:52:24.619 --> 02:52:25.619]  Yeah, I want an answer to that.
[02:52:25.619 --> 02:52:27.619]  Well, I don't feel comfortable answering that.
[02:52:27.619 --> 02:52:28.619]  Well, hold the hell on.
[02:52:28.619 --> 02:52:30.619]  Remember when the head of Moderna said he wasn't vaccinated.
[02:52:31.619 --> 02:52:33.619]  And this guy wouldn't even answer me.
[02:52:33.619 --> 02:52:38.619]  But wait, for the last year and a half, my bodily autonomy has been the world's business.
[02:52:38.619 --> 02:52:39.619]  It's been your business.
[02:52:39.619 --> 02:52:41.619]  You demanded to know if I was vaccinated.
[02:52:41.860 --> 02:52:43.860]  You demanded that I wore a mask.
[02:52:43.860 --> 02:52:45.860]  You demanded that I stayed an arbitrary six feet away from you.
[02:52:45.860 --> 02:52:49.860]  And now you are unwilling to tell me if you're vaccinated or not.
[02:52:49.860 --> 02:52:51.860]  By the way, you did what so many others don't.
[02:52:51.860 --> 02:52:52.860]  We've done it some.
[02:52:52.860 --> 02:52:55.860]  When you're talking to mainstream media, video it yourself so you can show what really happened.
[02:52:55.860 --> 02:52:56.860]  That was beautiful.
[02:52:56.860 --> 02:52:58.860]  So let me ask you this question, too, Peters.
[02:52:58.860 --> 02:53:00.860]  You just hit it.
[02:53:00.860 --> 02:53:02.860]  The people promoting it don't even believe in it.
[02:53:02.860 --> 02:53:04.860]  They don't even take the shot they're pushing on us.
[02:53:04.860 --> 02:53:08.860]  How do the people pushing this, not the top Satanist Luciferians at the top
[02:53:09.100 --> 02:53:12.100]  who are worshipping their God, have been promised immortality if they do this.
[02:53:12.100 --> 02:53:16.100]  They believe genetically with this technology and this new evolution they've been promised.
[02:53:16.100 --> 02:53:19.100]  They don't believe in God and the afterlife, but they believe in this thing
[02:53:19.100 --> 02:53:24.100]  and immortality that Schwarzenegger talks about they're about to have and Harari talks about.
[02:53:25.100 --> 02:53:27.100]  But what do you say to the minions in the system?
[02:53:27.100 --> 02:53:30.100]  When they can see this is destructive, they can see it's anti-human.
[02:53:30.100 --> 02:53:36.100]  Where's their pro-human home team attitude?
[02:53:36.340 --> 02:53:39.340]  Why do people at the minion level still serve this?
[02:53:39.340 --> 02:53:42.340]  Do they pretend to themselves that they're part of the power structure?
[02:53:42.340 --> 02:53:43.340]  They're going to win?
[02:53:43.340 --> 02:53:47.340]  Why do you think so many people that know it's all a lie still go along with it?
[02:53:47.340 --> 02:53:48.340]  Because they're followers?
[02:53:48.340 --> 02:53:49.340]  What is it?
[02:53:49.340 --> 02:53:53.340]  I mean, I think that they have bought into the idea that if you don't support this
[02:53:53.340 --> 02:53:56.340]  and if you don't go along with this, then you will be absolutely crushed.
[02:53:56.340 --> 02:54:00.340]  They feel like they're insiders to the plan so they know that all of the kinks
[02:54:00.340 --> 02:54:03.340]  have been worked out for complete world domination.
[02:54:03.340 --> 02:54:08.340]  They know what the future holds for dissenters and whistleblowers and truth tellers
[02:54:08.340 --> 02:54:11.340]  and that they will be eradicated and they will be gone.
[02:54:11.340 --> 02:54:13.340]  But don't they get they'll be eradicated too?
[02:54:13.340 --> 02:54:16.340]  I mean, you think this thing just wants to kill us?
[02:54:16.340 --> 02:54:18.340]  I mean, don't they have that common sense?
[02:54:18.340 --> 02:54:22.340]  No, I think that whether you're talking about the launch of the bioweapon
[02:54:22.340 --> 02:54:27.340]  or you're talking about a social credit score or electronic banking and digital currency
[02:54:27.340 --> 02:54:31.340]  that completely forbids you from accessing your smart refrigerator or getting food
[02:54:31.340 --> 02:54:34.340]  and all of these things, I believe that these people really feel like
[02:54:34.340 --> 02:54:37.340]  they are on the inside as a protected class.
[02:54:37.340 --> 02:54:41.340]  And I believe that these people are not morally upright.
[02:54:41.340 --> 02:54:45.340]  And I believe that these people have another thing coming because
[02:54:45.340 --> 02:54:49.340]  I'm optimistic, I'm optimistic, 100% optimistic
[02:54:49.340 --> 02:54:52.340]  because we are commanded to pick up the sword and fight.
[02:54:52.340 --> 02:54:56.340]  And at the end of the only truthful book ever written on the face of the planet,
[02:54:56.340 --> 02:54:59.340]  God wins and his people win.
[02:54:59.340 --> 02:55:01.340]  And so I know what's coming for these people.
[02:55:01.340 --> 02:55:07.340]  But these people right now also have an obligation to humanity.
[02:55:07.340 --> 02:55:13.340]  And I am telling you right now, mark my words, there will be a Nuremberg 2.
[02:55:13.340 --> 02:55:15.340]  I heard Renz talking about it.
[02:55:15.340 --> 02:55:19.340]  This is something that we're talking about mass extreme accountability.
[02:55:19.340 --> 02:55:23.340]  The line is really long for these people because there are a lot of people
[02:55:23.340 --> 02:55:27.340]  who have openly and intentionally profited from murder for money schemes
[02:55:27.340 --> 02:55:31.340]  and killing for cash and are targeting children for death and extinction
[02:55:31.340 --> 02:55:34.340]  and complete mutilation.
[02:55:34.340 --> 02:55:38.340]  These people should be held accountable in the most extreme way possible.
[02:55:38.340 --> 02:55:41.340]  And when they're found guilty, the death penalty absolutely needs to be
[02:55:41.340 --> 02:55:43.340]  on the table for these people.
[02:55:43.340 --> 02:55:44.340]  Stu Peters, let me ask you this.
[02:55:44.340 --> 02:55:46.340]  I guess I've been interviewing you three years or so.
[02:55:46.340 --> 02:55:47.340]  And you were great when I first interviewed you.
[02:55:47.340 --> 02:55:50.340]  But you get more and more on fire, which I love and it's beautiful.
[02:55:50.340 --> 02:55:52.340]  What's been your transformation?
[02:55:52.340 --> 02:55:57.340]  Why have you gotten more and more hardcore and just really seem born again hard?
[02:55:57.340 --> 02:56:02.340]  I just think that I'm seeing such a sense of urgency because I have three kids.
[02:56:02.340 --> 02:56:06.340]  I'm a single dad of an 11 and an 8 and a 4-year-old.
[02:56:06.340 --> 02:56:07.340]  I've got a little daughter.
[02:56:07.340 --> 02:56:09.340]  I see what's out here.
[02:56:09.340 --> 02:56:13.340]  As you do the show every day, as you very well know, you get approached by people
[02:56:13.340 --> 02:56:16.340]  who are in the worst place that they've ever been in their lives.
[02:56:16.340 --> 02:56:19.340]  They're telling some of the most horrific, heartbreaking stories
[02:56:19.340 --> 02:56:20.340]  that you've ever seen.
[02:56:20.340 --> 02:56:21.340]  They're emailing.
[02:56:21.340 --> 02:56:26.340]  I mean, for every four stories that we cover a day, I'm getting 400 or 4,000 emails
[02:56:26.340 --> 02:56:30.340]  from real people out there, giving real people a voice, elevating the voice of the people.
[02:56:30.340 --> 02:56:32.340]  It just pisses me off.
[02:56:32.340 --> 02:56:37.340]  And I'm filled with this righteous anger as I see people just lulled to sleep
[02:56:37.340 --> 02:56:40.340]  with their television sets and their smartphones.
[02:56:40.340 --> 02:56:44.340]  So your survival instinct as a warrior has kicked in.
[02:56:44.340 --> 02:56:49.340]  I see myself as a leading post-apocalyptic warlord right now.
[02:56:49.340 --> 02:56:54.340]  I think it's a divine calling that is unfortunate because it's painful
[02:56:54.340 --> 02:56:56.340]  and it leads you through some of the most—
[02:56:56.340 --> 02:56:59.340]  Well, definitely, the globalists fear men mobilizing together,
[02:56:59.340 --> 02:57:01.340]  and it's going to happen, and we will smash them.
[02:57:01.340 --> 02:57:03.340]  We will beat them.
[02:57:03.340 --> 02:57:05.340]  100%, I agree with that.
[02:57:05.340 --> 02:57:08.340]  I would not be here fighting if I didn't think that we were going to win.
[02:57:08.340 --> 02:57:09.340]  I agree with you.
[02:57:09.340 --> 02:57:10.340]  All right, Stu Peters, impressive.
[02:57:10.340 --> 02:57:11.340]  We love you.
[02:57:11.340 --> 02:57:12.340]  Please join me again soon.
[02:57:12.340 --> 02:57:13.340]  I'd love to come on your show.
[02:57:13.340 --> 02:57:14.340]  We love you.
[02:57:14.340 --> 02:57:15.340]  How do people find everything?
[02:57:15.340 --> 02:57:16.340]  Stu Peters.
[02:57:16.340 --> 02:57:17.340]  StuPeters.com all day.
[02:57:17.340 --> 02:57:18.340]  StuPeters.com.
[02:57:18.340 --> 02:57:20.340]  We have another film coming out, just like Died Suddenly.
[02:57:20.340 --> 02:57:22.340]  This one is called Final Days.
[02:57:22.340 --> 02:57:24.340]  And don't worry, there is a Died Suddenly 2 coming out.
[02:57:24.340 --> 02:57:26.340]  We have to save these people's lives.
[02:57:26.340 --> 02:57:27.340]  We have to push back against this.
[02:57:27.340 --> 02:57:28.340]  Alex, thank you so much for having me.
[02:57:28.340 --> 02:57:29.340]  I appreciate it.
[02:57:29.340 --> 02:57:31.340]  Well done, Lord Vader.
[02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:34.340]  All right, we'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:57:34.340 --> 02:57:36.340]  Hour number four, I've got a few final comments,
[02:57:36.340 --> 02:57:39.340]  and then our guest host, the amazing Drew Hernandez takes over.
[02:57:39.340 --> 02:57:40.340]  Woo!
[02:57:40.340 --> 02:57:42.340]  Stu Peters is in fuego.
[02:57:42.340 --> 02:57:44.340]  Stay with us.
[02:57:45.340 --> 02:57:49.340]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution,
[02:57:49.340 --> 02:57:52.340]  is laying right there in front of you, hidden in plain view.
[02:57:52.340 --> 02:57:55.340]  Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds.
[02:57:55.340 --> 02:57:59.340]  If you go to Wikipedia, it has links to the UN's own website
[02:57:59.340 --> 02:58:02.340]  where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability
[02:58:02.340 --> 02:58:05.340]  in the world is iodine deficiency.
[02:58:05.340 --> 02:58:09.340]  The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability
[02:58:09.340 --> 02:58:13.340]  is lack of real, pure iodine in the body.
[02:58:13.340 --> 02:58:17.340]  As they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine, bromide, chlorine,
[02:58:17.340 --> 02:58:19.340]  and so much more.
[02:58:19.340 --> 02:58:24.340]  Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet medical journal study in 2007
[02:58:24.340 --> 02:58:26.340]  worldwide have cognitive disabilities
[02:58:26.340 --> 02:58:29.340]  because they don't have high-quality iodine.
[02:58:29.340 --> 02:58:31.340]  Most iodine is bound to other elements.
[02:58:31.340 --> 02:58:32.340]  You don't absorb it.
[02:58:32.340 --> 02:58:34.340]  We have X3, all three types of the good iodine,
[02:58:34.340 --> 02:58:37.340]  together that supercharges your body.

[02:59:05.340 --> 02:59:07.340]  If you really want to treat yourself to something nice,
[02:59:07.340 --> 02:59:09.340]  get yourself an Alexa Pure water filter
[02:59:09.340 --> 02:59:13.340]  and get clean, healthy water whenever you want it,
[02:59:13.340 --> 02:59:14.340]  wherever you want it.
[02:59:14.340 --> 02:59:16.340]  Even if the water pressure goes out,
[02:59:16.340 --> 02:59:20.340]  the gravity-fed water filter has got you covered.
[02:59:20.340 --> 02:59:21.340]  Absolutely.
[02:59:21.340 --> 02:59:26.340]  And we couldn't do any of this without listener support.
[02:59:26.340 --> 02:59:27.340]  I was telling Greg earlier,
[02:59:27.340 --> 02:59:29.340]  we're like the real NPR,
[02:59:29.340 --> 02:59:31.340]  the real NPR of the base, right?

[02:59:40.340 --> 02:59:41.340]  Keep Alex Jones,
[02:59:41.340 --> 02:59:42.340]  Lauren Schroer,
[02:59:42.340 --> 02:59:43.340]  Harrison Smith,
[02:59:43.340 --> 02:59:44.340]  Greg Reis,
[02:59:44.340 --> 02:59:45.340]  Adam King,
[02:59:45.340 --> 02:59:46.340]  and the rest of us on air.
[02:59:46.340 --> 02:59:47.340]  Do it today.
[02:59:47.340 --> 02:59:48.340]  Do it now.
[02:59:48.340 --> 02:59:49.340]  Support the InfoWars.
[02:59:49.340 --> 02:59:54.340]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[02:59:54.340 --> 02:59:56.340]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:02.340 --> 03:00:05.340]  Well, this is an amazing broadcast today.
[03:00:05.340 --> 03:00:07.340]  Yesterday was killer.
[03:00:07.340 --> 03:00:09.340]  We had Stu Peters on.
[03:00:09.340 --> 03:00:11.340]  We had Tom Renz.
[03:00:11.340 --> 03:00:16.340]  And we got our big finisher coming up.
[03:00:16.340 --> 03:00:20.340]  Drew Hernandez had Owen coming in for the war room.
[03:00:20.340 --> 03:00:22.340]  I'm just very honored to know all these people.
[03:00:22.340 --> 03:00:24.340]  I mean, to get to know who stands for liberty,
[03:00:24.340 --> 03:00:26.340]  who has a soul.
[03:00:26.340 --> 03:00:27.340]  I look at our resistance.
[03:00:27.340 --> 03:00:28.340]  They're just beautiful people.
[03:00:28.340 --> 03:00:29.340]  They're eloquent.
[03:00:29.340 --> 03:00:30.340]  They're smart.
[03:00:30.340 --> 03:00:31.340]  They're amazing.
[03:00:31.340 --> 03:00:32.340]  They're full of fire.
[03:00:32.340 --> 03:00:33.340]  You look at the enemy's minions,
[03:00:33.340 --> 03:00:34.340]  they're like zombies stumbling around
[03:00:34.340 --> 03:00:35.340]  with snot coming out of their nose.
[03:00:35.340 --> 03:00:39.340]  I remember one time I was about 10 years old,
[03:00:39.340 --> 03:00:42.340]  and for some reason I was painting on the back porch.
[03:00:42.340 --> 03:00:46.340]  And I said to my dad,
[03:00:46.340 --> 03:00:47.340]  I said,
[03:00:47.340 --> 03:00:48.340]  Dad, paint the devil.
[03:00:48.340 --> 03:00:51.340]  And he painted,
[03:00:51.340 --> 03:00:52.340]  I wish I had the painting,
[03:00:52.340 --> 03:00:53.340]  like in 30 seconds,
[03:00:53.340 --> 03:00:57.340]  this horrible golem-like creature with snot coming out of its nose
[03:00:57.340 --> 03:00:58.340]  and this pathetic thing.
[03:00:58.340 --> 03:00:59.340]  And he said,
[03:00:59.340 --> 03:01:00.340]  That's the devil.
[03:01:00.340 --> 03:01:03.340]  And it was so powerful when he said that.
[03:01:04.340 --> 03:01:05.340]  In Revelation,
[03:01:05.340 --> 03:01:12.340]  after the archangel Michael bounds him with a chain,
[03:01:12.340 --> 03:01:15.340]  they put him in a cage for 1,000 years for people to look at Satan.
[03:01:15.340 --> 03:01:16.340]  And people will say,
[03:01:16.340 --> 03:01:18.340]  This is what did this?
[03:01:18.340 --> 03:01:20.340]  This thing?
[03:01:20.340 --> 03:01:22.340]  We were controlled by this?
[03:01:22.340 --> 03:01:25.340]  It's ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:29.340]  It's absolutely ridiculous.
[03:01:30.340 --> 03:01:33.340]  Jerry Hernandez is about to take over.
[03:01:33.340 --> 03:01:37.340]  I want to talk to listeners about something really important here in a moment.
[03:01:37.340 --> 03:01:43.340]  Man, it's all being revealed.
[03:01:43.340 --> 03:01:45.340]  The Bible says everything hidden will be revealed.
[03:01:45.340 --> 03:01:48.340]  And it's being revealed right now.
[03:01:48.340 --> 03:01:52.340]  I want to talk to listeners here about victory.
[03:01:52.340 --> 03:01:53.340]  You know,
[03:01:53.340 --> 03:01:57.340]  when I ask you for support to spread the word and to paint the devil,
[03:01:57.340 --> 03:02:00.340]  when I ask you for support to spread the word and to pray for us,
[03:02:00.340 --> 03:02:02.340]  that's because I know prayer is real.
[03:02:02.340 --> 03:02:05.340]  I know you sharing the articles and videos is real.
[03:02:05.340 --> 03:02:08.340]  And I know when you financially support us,
[03:02:08.340 --> 03:02:11.340]  it's real because that's what funds us.
[03:02:11.340 --> 03:02:14.340]  But I don't want to get it lost in translation that,
[03:02:14.340 --> 03:02:17.340]  Oh, buy these products, keep us on air.
[03:02:17.340 --> 03:02:18.340]  It's symbiotic.
[03:02:18.340 --> 03:02:19.340]  It's about a relationship.
[03:02:19.340 --> 03:02:22.340]  The products we have are the very best we can get,
[03:02:22.340 --> 03:02:23.340]  super high quality,
[03:02:23.340 --> 03:02:26.340]  lowest prices you're going to find that are game changing.
[03:02:26.340 --> 03:02:29.340]  It's that simple.
[03:02:29.340 --> 03:02:30.340]  I mean,
[03:02:30.340 --> 03:02:32.340]  when I sit up here and I tell you,
[03:02:32.340 --> 03:02:34.340]  you really need to get X3,
[03:02:34.340 --> 03:02:35.340]  the tri iodine,
[03:02:35.340 --> 03:02:36.340]  2 billion people,
[03:02:36.340 --> 03:02:37.340]  the UN estimates,
[03:02:37.340 --> 03:02:45.340]  Atlantic Journal confirms have cognitive disabilities because of iodine
[03:02:45.340 --> 03:02:46.340]  deficiency.
[03:02:46.340 --> 03:02:51.340]  When I tell you most iodine is bound to other elements and it's not
[03:02:51.340 --> 03:02:52.340]  absorbable.
[03:02:52.340 --> 03:02:53.340]  Justice.
[03:02:53.340 --> 03:02:55.340]  One thing is so game changing.
[03:02:55.340 --> 03:02:59.340]  If you just get it and take it for a month and see what it does to your
[03:02:59.340 --> 03:03:01.340]  skin and your body and everything,
[03:03:01.340 --> 03:03:03.340]  then everyone would have it.
[03:03:03.340 --> 03:03:06.340]  And we'd have incredible funding and could beat the new world order.
[03:03:06.340 --> 03:03:08.340]  But people have to try it.
[03:03:08.340 --> 03:03:10.340]  They have to actually go do it.
[03:03:10.340 --> 03:03:12.340]  You die without iodine.
[03:03:12.340 --> 03:03:14.340]  It's essential.
[03:03:14.340 --> 03:03:19.340]  You dial that oxygen in four minutes without water in about four or five
[03:03:19.340 --> 03:03:20.340]  days,
[03:03:20.340 --> 03:03:22.340]  not food about a month.
[03:03:22.340 --> 03:03:30.340]  But iodine is as essential as oxygen that we suck into our lungs that God
[03:03:30.340 --> 03:03:32.340]  gave us.
[03:03:32.340 --> 03:03:35.340]  Everyone should go to info or store.com right now.
[03:03:35.340 --> 03:03:41.340]  And you should get X3 and just take a bottle of it and see what happens in a
[03:03:41.340 --> 03:03:42.340]  month.
[03:03:42.340 --> 03:03:44.340]  Most people get results in two weeks.
[03:03:44.340 --> 03:03:47.340]  And I was just talking to a medical doctor a few days ago when I went and
[03:03:47.340 --> 03:03:48.340]  got a checkup.
[03:03:48.340 --> 03:03:50.340]  They said, oh, I see you talking about iodine.
[03:03:50.340 --> 03:03:51.340]  And what you say is true.
[03:03:51.340 --> 03:03:52.340]  Yeah.
[03:03:52.340 --> 03:03:54.340]  About two weeks in you kind of feel sick for a few days.
[03:03:54.340 --> 03:03:55.340]  And then it's like it happens.
[03:03:55.340 --> 03:03:59.340]  That's your brain recalibrating everything else.
[03:03:59.340 --> 03:04:05.340]  Most people that are deficient about two weeks in feel sick for about two
[03:04:05.340 --> 03:04:06.340]  days.
[03:04:06.340 --> 03:04:07.340]  And then it just gets incredible.
[03:04:07.340 --> 03:04:08.340]  Some people it takes a month.
[03:04:08.340 --> 03:04:10.340]  But that's like 10% of people on average.
[03:04:10.340 --> 03:04:12.340]  So it's a minority.
[03:04:12.340 --> 03:04:15.340]  I remember Dr. Group telling me 10 years ago when he sold me on this,
[03:04:15.340 --> 03:04:17.340]  he goes, you got a few sunspots on your face.
[03:04:17.340 --> 03:04:19.340]  And he said, not freckles, sunspots.
[03:04:19.340 --> 03:04:21.340]  He said, just take this for about a month, see what happens.
[03:04:21.340 --> 03:04:24.340]  My skin, libido, amazing.
[03:04:24.340 --> 03:04:27.340]  Get X3 at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:04:27.340 --> 03:04:29.340]  Fund the operation.
[03:04:29.340 --> 03:04:33.340]  But please take it and see that what I'm telling you is true.
[03:04:33.340 --> 03:04:35.340]  And then tell other people about it.
[03:04:35.340 --> 03:04:38.340]  Not just on this broadcast, but other places.
[03:04:38.340 --> 03:04:40.340]  Because wherever you get your iodine, get it.
[03:04:40.340 --> 03:04:42.340]  But if you only get X3, that's fine.
[03:04:42.340 --> 03:04:46.340]  Some Himalayan salt actually has deep earth crystal iodine and it's not as
[03:04:46.340 --> 03:04:48.340]  good, but it's close.
[03:04:48.340 --> 03:04:49.340]  Wherever you get it, get it.
[03:04:49.340 --> 03:04:51.340]  But X3 supports the broadcast.
[03:04:51.340 --> 03:04:53.340]  Go now to InfoWarsTour.com and get X3.
[03:04:53.340 --> 03:04:56.340]  We'll be right back with the great Drew Hernandez.
[03:04:56.340 --> 03:04:59.340]  In the early 1900s,
[03:04:59.340 --> 03:05:04.340]  certain companies were off-gassing highly toxic fluoride gases into the
[03:05:04.340 --> 03:05:05.340]  atmosphere.
[03:05:05.340 --> 03:05:07.340]  The surrounding communities began to get sick.
[03:05:07.340 --> 03:05:12.340]  Laws were enacted to compel these corporations to install scrubbers,
[03:05:12.340 --> 03:05:15.340]  to convert these gases into fluorosilicic acid.
[03:05:15.340 --> 03:05:18.340]  Still highly toxic, but containable.
[03:05:18.340 --> 03:05:21.340]  Now these companies had a stockpile of this poison.
[03:05:21.340 --> 03:05:24.340]  And there was no affordable way to dispose of it.
[03:05:24.340 --> 03:05:25.340]  Lucky for them,
[03:05:25.340 --> 03:05:29.340]  one of their major stockholders was also the secretary of the treasury,
[03:05:29.340 --> 03:05:32.340]  who was responsible for the public health service at the time.
[03:05:32.340 --> 03:05:34.340]  And by 1950,
[03:05:34.340 --> 03:05:37.340]  the U.S. government began buying this toxic,
[03:05:37.340 --> 03:05:41.340]  untreated industrial waste product and dumping it into our drinking water.
[03:05:41.340 --> 03:05:46.340]  Reputable studies show that it's causing various cancers and other disease.
[03:05:46.340 --> 03:05:48.340]  With the Alexa Pure Pro,
[03:05:48.340 --> 03:05:52.340]  you can have clean drinking water and a remedy to this madness.
[03:05:52.340 --> 03:05:56.340]  Available now at InfoWarsTour.com.
[03:05:56.340 --> 03:06:10.340]  Well, we're now into our number four on this live May 18th Thursday transmission.
[03:06:10.340 --> 03:06:11.340]  Drew Hernandez,
[03:06:11.340 --> 03:06:13.340]  a great political activist,
[03:06:13.340 --> 03:06:14.340]  reporter and pastor,
[03:06:14.340 --> 03:06:17.340]  is about to take over in 54 minutes.
[03:06:17.340 --> 03:06:18.340]  Owen Schroer,
[03:06:18.340 --> 03:06:19.340]  The War Room,
[03:06:19.340 --> 03:06:20.340]  3 to 6 p.m.
[03:06:20.340 --> 03:06:24.340]  But both Drew and Owen have been at the border in the last couple weeks.
[03:06:25.340 --> 03:06:27.340]  I've got a lot to report to you.
[03:06:27.340 --> 03:06:31.340]  I just wanted to add again how blessed I am to be involved with all of you.
[03:06:31.340 --> 03:06:35.340]  It has been an absolute blessing to find out who the real people are.
[03:06:35.340 --> 03:06:38.340]  And that really is the empowerment of this journey,
[03:06:38.340 --> 03:06:39.340]  despite the persecution,
[03:06:39.340 --> 03:06:44.340]  is you get to meet the real people that are touched by God.
[03:06:44.340 --> 03:06:47.340]  And I feel so sorry for people that,
[03:06:47.340 --> 03:06:48.340]  for whatever reason,
[03:06:48.340 --> 03:06:51.340]  never got a chance to know God.
[03:06:52.340 --> 03:06:56.340]  And the journey of knowing God and the journey of fighting for what's right
[03:06:56.340 --> 03:06:58.340]  doesn't mean we have all the answers.
[03:06:58.340 --> 03:06:59.340]  We're not cult leaders.
[03:06:59.340 --> 03:07:00.340]  We're not perfect.
[03:07:00.340 --> 03:07:01.340]  But we know God's real.
[03:07:01.340 --> 03:07:03.340]  We know the devil's real.
[03:07:03.340 --> 03:07:04.340]  And that's what this is all about.
[03:07:04.340 --> 03:07:06.340]  And you've got Obama saying,
[03:07:06.340 --> 03:07:07.340]  and all the other leftists,
[03:07:07.340 --> 03:07:08.340]  oh, no one listens to us.
[03:07:08.340 --> 03:07:09.340]  What are we going to do?
[03:07:09.340 --> 03:07:11.340]  They don't believe our facts.
[03:07:11.340 --> 03:07:14.340]  Humanity doesn't know what's happening yet on average,
[03:07:14.340 --> 03:07:16.340]  but they know they're being lied to.
[03:07:16.340 --> 03:07:18.340]  So they're breaking away from the enemy.
[03:07:19.340 --> 03:07:21.340]  That large portion, a large minority,
[03:07:21.340 --> 03:07:23.340]  almost a majority in some areas,
[03:07:23.340 --> 03:07:26.340]  are breaking away right now.
[03:07:26.340 --> 03:07:29.340]  And the enemy wants control of the soul,
[03:07:29.340 --> 03:07:31.340]  and they are just outraged.
[03:07:31.340 --> 03:07:32.340]  They want our children.
[03:07:32.340 --> 03:07:34.340]  But I notice as they come with the children,
[03:07:34.340 --> 03:07:36.340]  with the transgenderism and the rest of it,
[03:07:36.340 --> 03:07:39.340]  that's finally the breaking point where the enemy will go too far.
[03:07:39.340 --> 03:07:41.340]  The enemy can't stop.
[03:07:41.340 --> 03:07:43.340]  It's like a missile on target.
[03:07:43.340 --> 03:07:44.340]  It's going to do what it's going to do.
[03:07:44.340 --> 03:07:46.340]  That's what devil worshippers and Satanists do.
[03:07:46.340 --> 03:07:48.340]  They're going to carry out this operation.
[03:07:48.340 --> 03:07:50.340]  They're not going to stop.
[03:07:50.340 --> 03:07:53.340]  And so you can be guaranteed
[03:07:53.340 --> 03:07:56.340]  that you'll be destroyed if you serve this.
[03:07:56.340 --> 03:07:58.340]  People ask me, how do you have courage?
[03:07:58.340 --> 03:08:01.340]  I don't have courage, folks.
[03:08:01.340 --> 03:08:03.340]  I don't have courage.
[03:08:03.340 --> 03:08:06.340]  I know we're all destroyed if this wins.
[03:08:06.340 --> 03:08:07.340]  Again, if your house is on fire
[03:08:07.340 --> 03:08:09.340]  and you pick your kids up and run out of the house,
[03:08:09.340 --> 03:08:10.340]  you're not a hero.
[03:08:10.340 --> 03:08:12.340]  You've got a burning house.
[03:08:12.340 --> 03:08:15.340]  If you're in a sinking ship and you get in a lifeboat,
[03:08:15.340 --> 03:08:18.340]  you're not a hero.
[03:08:18.340 --> 03:08:21.340]  It's not heroic to break with the liars.
[03:08:21.340 --> 03:08:24.340]  It's called common sense.
[03:08:24.340 --> 03:08:27.340]  And that's what I keep trying to explain.
[03:08:27.340 --> 03:08:30.340]  The default, when things are going bad
[03:08:30.340 --> 03:08:31.340]  and you're being lied to,
[03:08:31.340 --> 03:08:34.340]  is to stop believing the liars
[03:08:34.340 --> 03:08:36.340]  and realize that this is a spiritual battle
[03:08:36.340 --> 03:08:37.340]  and the devil's real,
[03:08:37.340 --> 03:08:41.340]  but God is real as well and is infinitely more powerful.
[03:08:41.340 --> 03:08:43.340]  But you have free will.
[03:08:43.340 --> 03:08:47.340]  And so our evil manifests that and allows that to operate.
[03:08:47.340 --> 03:08:49.340]  All right, Drew Hernandez takes over the balance of the hour.
[03:08:49.340 --> 03:08:51.340]  Really appreciate his work.
[03:08:51.340 --> 03:08:53.340]  Drew Hernandez.
[03:08:53.340 --> 03:08:56.340]  Alex Jones, thank you for allowing me to host this great show
[03:08:56.340 --> 03:08:59.340]  that has always been on the tip of the spear of truth,
[03:08:59.340 --> 03:09:02.340]  the tip of the spear on reality.
[03:09:02.340 --> 03:09:03.340]  You know, it's tomorrow's news today.
[03:09:03.340 --> 03:09:05.340]  We're always ahead of what's really taking place,
[03:09:05.340 --> 03:09:08.340]  people understanding what's going along in society
[03:09:08.340 --> 03:09:11.340]  with the pedophiles and the groomers
[03:09:11.340 --> 03:09:13.340]  and the New World Order advancing on all fronts
[03:09:13.340 --> 03:09:15.340]  with the collapse of American sovereignty,
[03:09:15.340 --> 03:09:16.340]  with everyone watching.
[03:09:16.340 --> 03:09:18.340]  I mean, even the churches being infiltrated,
[03:09:18.340 --> 03:09:20.340]  you know, with wolves in sheep's clothing,
[03:09:20.340 --> 03:09:22.340]  as Jesus said what happened,
[03:09:22.340 --> 03:09:23.340]  individuals that claim to be good
[03:09:23.340 --> 03:09:25.340]  when obviously they are evil
[03:09:25.340 --> 03:09:27.340]  and they are on the wrong side of everything.
[03:09:27.340 --> 03:09:29.340]  You know, right now, more than ever,
[03:09:29.340 --> 03:09:30.340]  I want to encourage the viewers,
[03:09:30.340 --> 03:09:32.340]  all the info warriors worldwide,
[03:09:32.340 --> 03:09:33.340]  based thought criminals,
[03:09:33.340 --> 03:09:34.340]  everyone that watches,
[03:09:34.340 --> 03:09:36.340]  anyone that's actually telling some truth
[03:09:36.340 --> 03:09:37.340]  that's getting canceled,
[03:09:37.340 --> 03:09:38.340]  that's getting censored,
[03:09:38.340 --> 03:09:39.340]  that's losing everything
[03:09:40.340 --> 03:09:42.340]  they possibly could have ever had.
[03:09:42.340 --> 03:09:44.340]  You know, this is where it hits you
[03:09:44.340 --> 03:09:45.340]  right in between the eyes.
[03:09:45.340 --> 03:09:48.340]  You know, this is why Jesus made it very clear.
[03:09:48.340 --> 03:09:50.340]  Earthly treasures are meaningless.
[03:09:50.340 --> 03:09:51.340]  They mean nothing.
[03:09:51.340 --> 03:09:52.340]  They will rot away.
[03:09:52.340 --> 03:09:54.340]  They will not last forever.
[03:09:54.340 --> 03:09:57.340]  The heavenly treasure will last forever.
[03:09:57.340 --> 03:09:59.340]  That is the end game.
[03:09:59.340 --> 03:10:02.340]  The ultimate heavenly treasure is Christ.
[03:10:02.340 --> 03:10:05.340]  He is the goal, eternal life with him.
[03:10:05.340 --> 03:10:07.340]  Listen, I don't want to go to heaven if he ain't there.
[03:10:08.340 --> 03:10:10.340]  I want to go wherever Jesus Christ is.
[03:10:10.340 --> 03:10:12.340]  If Jesus Christ ain't in heaven,
[03:10:12.340 --> 03:10:14.340]  I don't want to go there.
[03:10:14.340 --> 03:10:17.340]  Even heaven itself, yes, is a prize.
[03:10:17.340 --> 03:10:19.340]  I want to go where he's going.
[03:10:19.340 --> 03:10:20.340]  Absolutely.
[03:10:20.340 --> 03:10:22.340]  Alex Jones understands this as well.
[03:10:22.340 --> 03:10:23.340]  And you know this, Alex.
[03:10:23.340 --> 03:10:26.340]  You've been watching this for the past few years,
[03:10:26.340 --> 03:10:29.340]  this spiritual journey where people find themselves
[03:10:29.340 --> 03:10:31.340]  really understanding what matters the most
[03:10:31.340 --> 03:10:33.340]  when you lose everything around you,
[03:10:33.340 --> 03:10:35.340]  people you thought you trust,
[03:10:35.340 --> 03:10:36.340]  things that we thought were valuable,
[03:10:36.340 --> 03:10:39.340]  things that we thought were actually kind of working for us
[03:10:39.340 --> 03:10:41.340]  when everything collapses,
[03:10:41.340 --> 03:10:43.340]  when these powers think that they're winning,
[03:10:43.340 --> 03:10:45.340]  think that they're advancing.
[03:10:45.340 --> 03:10:48.340]  But in reality, Alex, you're walking with God.
[03:10:48.340 --> 03:10:50.340]  You're walking with Christ.
[03:10:50.340 --> 03:10:52.340]  And in the end, the only thing that matters
[03:10:52.340 --> 03:10:54.340]  is that you're in obedience to him.
[03:10:54.340 --> 03:10:57.340]  Alex Jones, with the largest audience
[03:10:57.340 --> 03:10:59.340]  that he could ever accumulate,
[03:10:59.340 --> 03:11:01.340]  the only eye, the only ear,
[03:11:01.340 --> 03:11:04.340]  the only attention span that truly matters
[03:11:04.340 --> 03:11:06.340]  is Christ himself.
[03:11:06.340 --> 03:11:09.340]  In obedience to him, we are winning.
[03:11:09.340 --> 03:11:12.340]  Listen, I don't expect God to be on my side.
[03:11:12.340 --> 03:11:14.340]  God is not on my side.
[03:11:14.340 --> 03:11:16.340]  I'm on his.
[03:11:16.340 --> 03:11:18.340]  I want to be on his side,
[03:11:18.340 --> 03:11:20.340]  because I am useless.
[03:11:20.340 --> 03:11:22.340]  We are useless human beings.
[03:11:22.340 --> 03:11:25.340]  We cannot win this fight in any way, shape, or form.
[03:11:25.340 --> 03:11:27.340]  I want to be on his side.
[03:11:27.340 --> 03:11:29.340]  And if God be for us, who could be against us?
[03:11:29.340 --> 03:11:32.340]  The only way to truly be on his side
[03:11:32.340 --> 03:11:34.340]  is if you are in complete submission
[03:11:34.340 --> 03:11:37.340]  and obedience to him entirely.
[03:11:37.340 --> 03:11:40.340]  And sometimes, God will allow everything
[03:11:40.340 --> 03:11:42.340]  to fall apart in order for you
[03:11:42.340 --> 03:11:46.340]  to be totally, 100% dependent,
[03:11:46.340 --> 03:11:48.340]  exhausting all fuel,
[03:11:48.340 --> 03:11:50.340]  all human ability,
[03:11:50.340 --> 03:11:52.340]  all human fuel,
[03:11:52.340 --> 03:11:54.340]  to bring you to the very end,
[03:11:54.340 --> 03:11:56.340]  to open your eyes to realize,
[03:11:56.340 --> 03:11:58.340]  all right, now it's go time.
[03:11:58.340 --> 03:12:00.340]  God is with you along the entire way.
[03:12:00.340 --> 03:12:01.340]  Drew, I want to agree with you,
[03:12:01.340 --> 03:12:02.340]  and I don't want to take over the show,
[03:12:02.340 --> 03:12:04.340]  but I was watching, listening.
[03:12:04.340 --> 03:12:06.340]  I've literally seen God take me right
[03:12:06.340 --> 03:12:08.340]  to the brink of destruction and say,
[03:12:08.340 --> 03:12:10.340]  tomorrow I'm going to fix it just to show me,
[03:12:10.340 --> 03:12:11.340]  and God does it.
[03:12:11.340 --> 03:12:13.340]  Like, I already know God's real,
[03:12:13.340 --> 03:12:15.340]  but it's like God just keeps doing it
[03:12:15.340 --> 03:12:17.340]  over and over again.
[03:12:17.340 --> 03:12:19.340]  And I think InfoWars is a testament to that, Alex.
[03:12:19.340 --> 03:12:21.340]  I mean, I watch it every day.
[03:12:21.340 --> 03:12:23.340]  The viewers watch it every day,
[03:12:23.340 --> 03:12:26.340]  watching InfoWars running less on fumes,
[03:12:26.340 --> 03:12:28.340]  below fumes,
[03:12:28.340 --> 03:12:30.340]  everybody making it across the finish line,
[03:12:30.340 --> 03:12:31.340]  going, going, going,
[03:12:31.340 --> 03:12:33.340]  with all these massive corporations.
[03:12:33.340 --> 03:12:36.340]  Like, the viewers really understand
[03:12:36.340 --> 03:12:39.340]  what we are up against on a daily basis.
[03:12:39.340 --> 03:12:42.340]  We are up against corporations,
[03:12:42.340 --> 03:12:44.340]  evil individuals,
[03:12:44.340 --> 03:12:46.340]  so-called organizations that hide themselves
[03:12:46.340 --> 03:12:48.340]  behind the banner of humanitarian,
[03:12:48.340 --> 03:12:51.340]  world health, you name it, AI, right?
[03:12:51.340 --> 03:12:54.340]  We are up against a lot, okay?
[03:12:54.340 --> 03:12:56.340]  And these demon powers that are all
[03:12:56.340 --> 03:12:59.340]  influencing and empowering that have been around
[03:12:59.340 --> 03:13:01.340]  for thousands of years, okay?
[03:13:01.340 --> 03:13:03.340]  This is what we are truly up against.
[03:13:03.340 --> 03:13:06.340]  The Spirit of God is what is needed.
[03:13:06.340 --> 03:13:08.340]  It is essential to move forward.
[03:13:08.340 --> 03:13:09.340]  Alex understands this.
[03:13:09.340 --> 03:13:11.340]  I know the viewers understand this.
[03:13:11.340 --> 03:13:13.340]  But before we go forward with anything,
[03:13:13.340 --> 03:13:15.340]  we really do need to be in obedience to Christ
[03:13:15.340 --> 03:13:16.340]  because I can feel it, Alex.
[03:13:16.340 --> 03:13:17.340]  Can you feel it?
[03:13:17.340 --> 03:13:19.340]  Can you feel like we're like on the verge
[03:13:19.340 --> 03:13:20.340]  with this next election?
[03:13:20.340 --> 03:13:22.340]  I know we say this all the time, you know,
[03:13:22.340 --> 03:13:23.340]  on our shows every single cycle,
[03:13:23.340 --> 03:13:25.340]  but this one, there's just something there.
[03:13:25.340 --> 03:13:26.340]  There's something here.
[03:13:26.340 --> 03:13:30.340]  Well, I can feel the spirit of evil really moving,
[03:13:30.340 --> 03:13:32.340]  but I feel God coming in big.
[03:13:32.340 --> 03:13:34.340]  Actually, I'm not scared of the devil.
[03:13:34.340 --> 03:13:35.340]  I'm scared of God.
[03:13:35.340 --> 03:13:38.340]  I can feel God's like moving in right now.
[03:13:38.340 --> 03:13:40.340]  It's like big.
[03:13:40.340 --> 03:13:42.340]  And everyone can sense that.
[03:13:42.340 --> 03:13:44.340]  You know, I think everyone on either side,
[03:13:44.340 --> 03:13:46.340]  whatever side they find them on,
[03:13:46.340 --> 03:13:48.340]  I think people that are in obedience to Satan,
[03:13:48.340 --> 03:13:51.340]  that are, you know, they are pro-murdering children.
[03:13:51.340 --> 03:13:54.340]  They are pro-mutilating the genitals of children.
[03:13:54.340 --> 03:13:57.340]  They know that their time is getting closer
[03:13:57.340 --> 03:13:59.340]  and closer and closer to what they believe
[03:13:59.340 --> 03:14:01.340]  is going to be the ultimate culmination
[03:14:01.340 --> 03:14:02.340]  of the New World Order.
[03:14:02.340 --> 03:14:05.340]  These people know that we're moving forward
[03:14:05.340 --> 03:14:08.340]  closer and closer and closer to that final showdown,
[03:14:08.340 --> 03:14:11.340]  just like we know, just like the Christians
[03:14:11.340 --> 03:14:13.340]  understand fully, fundamentally,
[03:14:13.340 --> 03:14:16.340]  that we are moving forward into the timeline
[03:14:16.340 --> 03:14:18.340]  that God has created for all of humanity
[03:14:18.340 --> 03:14:20.340]  for his specific purposes.
[03:14:20.340 --> 03:14:22.340]  Everyone can see the direction we're going,
[03:14:22.340 --> 03:14:24.340]  and that's why it's interesting,
[03:14:24.340 --> 03:14:26.340]  and I encourage a lot of atheists out there
[03:14:26.340 --> 03:14:29.340]  that are really skeptical on the existence of God.
[03:14:29.340 --> 03:14:31.340]  I mean, look around you, man.
[03:14:31.340 --> 03:14:32.340]  This stuff is not political.
[03:14:32.340 --> 03:14:34.340]  You cannot sit here and say this is some kind of
[03:14:34.340 --> 03:14:37.340]  Democrat-Republican beef going on, man.
[03:14:37.340 --> 03:14:40.340]  Like, this is really just straight Satan.
[03:14:40.340 --> 03:14:42.340]  This is being directed by outside forces.
[03:14:42.340 --> 03:14:44.340]  Absolutely.
[03:14:44.340 --> 03:14:46.340]  And you've talked about this for years, Alex,
[03:14:46.340 --> 03:14:48.340]  and I think, you know, what's happening with Infowars,
[03:14:48.340 --> 03:14:50.340]  I think, will be a testament.
[03:14:50.340 --> 03:14:52.340]  I think Infowars has always been something,
[03:14:52.340 --> 03:14:57.340]  this anomaly, this shooting star
[03:14:57.340 --> 03:15:01.340]  that God has always used to just really trailblaze,
[03:15:01.340 --> 03:15:03.340]  to show the world what it's really looked like.
[03:15:03.340 --> 03:15:05.340]  And, you know, Alex, maybe you never intended it
[03:15:05.340 --> 03:15:07.340]  to be that way, but I see it that way.
[03:15:07.340 --> 03:15:09.340]  I know the Christians see it that way.
[03:15:09.340 --> 03:15:12.340]  How does this independent machine
[03:15:12.340 --> 03:15:15.340]  make it this far against all of these powers?
[03:15:15.340 --> 03:15:17.340]  Is it because Alex Jones is strong?
[03:15:17.340 --> 03:15:19.340]  Is it because the network is strong?
[03:15:19.340 --> 03:15:21.340]  Is it because the Internet, we're in the future?
[03:15:21.340 --> 03:15:22.340]  No, no, no, no.
[03:15:22.340 --> 03:15:24.340]  God has been behind this the entire time, Alex,
[03:15:24.340 --> 03:15:26.340]  and God will continue to be with it
[03:15:26.340 --> 03:15:28.340]  just as long as we're in obedience to him.
[03:15:28.340 --> 03:15:30.340]  We don't got to worry about anything.
[03:15:30.340 --> 03:15:32.340]  And I'm not saying just put our heads in the sand.
[03:15:32.340 --> 03:15:33.340]  Don't get it twisted.
[03:15:33.340 --> 03:15:35.340]  That's not the kind of Christian I am.
[03:15:35.340 --> 03:15:37.340]  We will continue to move forward and fight
[03:15:37.340 --> 03:15:39.340]  with God's power, but at the same time,
[03:15:39.340 --> 03:15:41.340]  we know that God has us.
[03:15:41.340 --> 03:15:42.340]  Alex, I know you understand that.
[03:15:42.340 --> 03:15:43.340]  You're right.
[03:15:43.340 --> 03:15:44.340]  I'm going to stop interrupting.
[03:15:44.340 --> 03:15:45.340]  You take over, my friend.
[03:15:45.340 --> 03:15:46.340]  Love you.
[03:15:46.340 --> 03:15:47.340]  But it's all good versus evil.
[03:15:47.340 --> 03:15:48.340]  It's 100% real, folks.
[03:15:49.340 --> 03:15:50.340]  The devil believes in you.
[03:15:50.340 --> 03:15:52.340]  You better believe the devil's real, folks.
[03:15:57.340 --> 03:16:00.340]  Most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[03:16:05.340 --> 03:16:06.340]  I want you all to know something.
[03:16:06.340 --> 03:16:08.340]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:16:08.340 --> 03:16:12.340]  Alex is right about far more than he's wrong.
[03:16:12.340 --> 03:16:15.340]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[03:16:15.340 --> 03:16:17.340]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it,
[03:16:17.340 --> 03:16:19.340]  flip it up, or rub it down.
[03:16:19.340 --> 03:16:21.340]  Alex Jones was right.
[03:16:21.340 --> 03:16:23.340]  Think about how frustrated we are
[03:16:23.340 --> 03:16:25.340]  if you've been awake for a year or two.
[03:16:25.340 --> 03:16:27.340]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys
[03:16:27.340 --> 03:16:29.340]  who've been awake for, like, decades.
[03:16:29.340 --> 03:16:31.340]  Alex Jones called this years ago.
[03:16:31.340 --> 03:16:32.340]  Years ago.
[03:16:32.340 --> 03:16:34.340]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[03:16:34.340 --> 03:16:36.340]  Not for a second.
[03:16:36.340 --> 03:16:39.340]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[03:16:39.340 --> 03:16:41.340]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[03:16:41.340 --> 03:16:44.340]  The government fears Alex Jones.
[03:16:44.340 --> 03:16:46.340]  That's why the globalists hate me.
[03:16:46.340 --> 03:16:49.340]  It's because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[03:16:56.340 --> 03:16:58.340]  Turbo Force is back.
[03:16:58.340 --> 03:17:00.340]  Sold out for eight months.
[03:17:00.340 --> 03:17:01.340]  And it's Turbo Force Plus.
[03:17:01.340 --> 03:17:03.340]  We made it even stronger.
[03:17:03.340 --> 03:17:06.340]  The strongest long-term energy
[03:17:06.340 --> 03:17:07.340]  you're going to find anywhere.
[03:17:07.340 --> 03:17:09.340]  Turbo Force is back in stock
[03:17:09.340 --> 03:17:11.340]  at Infowarsstore.com
[03:17:11.340 --> 03:17:14.340]  or 888-253-3139.
[03:17:14.340 --> 03:17:18.340]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs
[03:17:18.340 --> 03:17:20.340]  that time-release over 10 hours.
[03:17:20.340 --> 03:17:22.340]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[03:17:22.340 --> 03:17:24.340]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals
[03:17:24.340 --> 03:17:26.340]  and a bunch of other key things
[03:17:26.340 --> 03:17:30.340]  and amino acids that turbocharge everything
[03:17:30.340 --> 03:17:32.340]  and are good for your heart, your brain, your liver,
[03:17:32.340 --> 03:17:34.340]  you name it.
[03:17:34.340 --> 03:17:37.340]  It is the super fuel.
[03:17:37.340 --> 03:17:39.340]  Brain Force Plus is great.
[03:17:39.340 --> 03:17:40.340]  Brain Force Ultra is great.
[03:17:40.340 --> 03:17:41.340]  They're two different nootropics.
[03:17:41.340 --> 03:17:42.340]  They go good with this.
[03:17:42.340 --> 03:17:45.340]  But this is the King Kong.
[03:17:45.340 --> 03:17:46.340]  This is the boss.
[03:17:46.340 --> 03:17:47.340]  Turbo Force.
[03:17:47.340 --> 03:17:48.340]  Back in stock.
[03:17:48.340 --> 03:17:49.340]  Discounted.
[03:17:49.340 --> 03:17:51.340]  Infowarsstore.com.
[03:17:51.340 --> 03:17:52.340]  More power.
[03:17:52.340 --> 03:17:53.340]  More strength.
[03:17:53.340 --> 03:17:54.340]  More energy.
[03:17:57.340 --> 03:17:58.340]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[03:17:58.340 --> 03:17:59.340]  this book,
[03:17:59.340 --> 03:18:00.340]  The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[03:18:00.340 --> 03:18:02.340]  is a historic book that documents the globalists
[03:18:02.340 --> 03:18:03.340]  in their own words
[03:18:03.340 --> 03:18:05.340]  plan for our future.
[03:18:05.340 --> 03:18:06.340]  That is a hellish future.
[03:18:06.340 --> 03:18:08.340]  Now you'll be always,
[03:18:08.340 --> 03:18:09.340]  while they still allow books,
[03:18:09.340 --> 03:18:10.340]  I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:18:10.340 --> 03:18:11.340]  be able to get an unsigned copy
[03:18:11.340 --> 03:18:13.340]  of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[03:18:13.340 --> 03:18:16.340]  at bookstores, Amazon, or infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:16.340 --> 03:18:17.340]  But you will never be able
[03:18:17.340 --> 03:18:19.340]  to get another signed copy of the book
[03:18:19.340 --> 03:18:21.340]  after the signed copies we got run out.
[03:18:21.340 --> 03:18:24.340]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:18:24.340 --> 03:18:26.340]  So get your copy of The Great Reset
[03:18:26.340 --> 03:18:27.340]  and the War for the World,
[03:18:27.340 --> 03:18:28.340]  a signed copy,
[03:18:28.340 --> 03:18:29.340]  at infowarsstore.com.
[03:18:29.340 --> 03:18:31.340]  And there is a markup there
[03:18:31.340 --> 03:18:32.340]  because this is a fundraiser
[03:18:32.340 --> 03:18:33.340]  to keep us on the air.
[03:18:33.340 --> 03:18:35.340]  So you won't just have this historic memento
[03:18:35.340 --> 03:18:36.340]  and this powerful book,
[03:18:36.340 --> 03:18:37.340]  you'll also know
[03:18:37.340 --> 03:18:39.340]  that you help keep infowars on the air.
[03:18:39.340 --> 03:18:40.340]  I want to thank those of you
[03:18:40.340 --> 03:18:42.340]  that have gotten signed copies of the book
[03:18:42.340 --> 03:18:43.340]  or unsigned copies.
[03:18:43.340 --> 03:18:45.340]  But I want to encourage all of you
[03:18:45.340 --> 03:18:46.340]  who haven't yet
[03:18:46.340 --> 03:18:47.340]  to go to infowarsstore.com
[03:18:47.340 --> 03:18:48.340]  and get a signed copy
[03:18:48.340 --> 03:18:50.340]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies
[03:18:50.340 --> 03:18:51.340]  and donate them to the library
[03:18:51.340 --> 03:18:53.340]  or give them to the local school.
[03:18:53.340 --> 03:18:54.340]  This is an infowar.
[03:18:54.340 --> 03:18:55.340]  I'm counting on you
[03:18:55.340 --> 03:18:56.340]  and thank you for your support.
[03:18:56.340 --> 03:18:58.340]  Iodine is naturally acquired
[03:18:58.340 --> 03:18:59.340]  through the soil,
[03:18:59.340 --> 03:19:01.340]  which is at the foundation
[03:19:01.340 --> 03:19:03.340]  of our entire food supply.
[03:19:03.340 --> 03:19:05.340]  Modern farming techniques
[03:19:05.340 --> 03:19:06.340]  have stripped the soil
[03:19:06.340 --> 03:19:08.340]  of this essential trace element,
[03:19:08.340 --> 03:19:10.340]  which has caused an iodine deficiency
[03:19:10.340 --> 03:19:12.340]  in about half the population.
[03:19:12.340 --> 03:19:13.340]  And there are two things
[03:19:13.340 --> 03:19:15.340]  we need to do about it.
[03:19:15.340 --> 03:19:16.340]  We need to practice
[03:19:16.340 --> 03:19:18.340]  more regenerative farming.
[03:19:18.340 --> 03:19:19.340]  There are plenty
[03:19:19.340 --> 03:19:21.340]  of proven technologies
[03:19:21.340 --> 03:19:23.340]  in permaculture and biodynamics
[03:19:23.340 --> 03:19:25.340]  that will naturally keep the soil
[03:19:25.340 --> 03:19:27.340]  rich with iodine.
[03:19:27.340 --> 03:19:28.340]  And we need to ensure
[03:19:28.340 --> 03:19:30.340]  that we get the sufficient amount
[03:19:30.340 --> 03:19:32.340]  of iodine every day
[03:19:32.340 --> 03:19:34.340]  derived from ancient sea salts
[03:19:34.340 --> 03:19:36.340]  found thousands of feet
[03:19:36.340 --> 03:19:37.340]  below the Earth's surface.
[03:19:37.340 --> 03:19:41.340]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3
[03:19:41.340 --> 03:19:43.340]  is hands down the best.
[03:19:43.340 --> 03:19:45.340]  Pure nascent iodine
[03:19:45.340 --> 03:19:47.340]  stabilized in an activated
[03:19:47.340 --> 03:19:49.340]  triiodine form.
[03:19:49.340 --> 03:19:51.340]  For a healthy thyroid
[03:19:51.340 --> 03:19:52.340]  and a healthy metabolism,

[03:19:56.340 --> 03:19:58.340]  Leading a frontal assault
[03:19:58.340 --> 03:20:01.340]  on the lies of the New World Order,
[03:20:01.340 --> 03:20:03.340]  it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:03.340 --> 03:20:05.340]  www.infowars.com
[03:20:05.400 --> 03:20:18.279]  Alrighty, ladies and gentlemen, Info Warriors worldwide, not only in the United States
[03:20:18.279 --> 03:20:23.240]  of America, across the globe tuning in today, all the based thought criminals out there
[03:20:23.240 --> 03:20:29.199]  want to thank you guys for tuning in the fourth hour of the Most Banned Show on the face of
[03:20:29.199 --> 03:20:35.720]  planet Earth. Right now here in the 21st century, the year 2023, the Alex Jones Show. My name
[03:20:35.720 --> 03:20:40.240]  is Drew Hernandez. I am your guest host for the remainder of the Alex Jones Show. We are
[03:20:40.240 --> 03:20:44.320]  going to get lit. We're not going to hold anything back. We're not going to get all
[03:20:44.320 --> 03:20:48.960]  cucked out and be afraid to hurt people's feelings. That's not the energy we need right
[03:20:48.960 --> 03:20:53.680]  now. You know, all the cuckservatives and the lip wristed right wingers that are like,
[03:20:53.680 --> 03:21:00.000]  let's just, let's just find common ground with the pedophiles and find common ground
[03:21:00.000 --> 03:21:05.520]  with the communists. Let's find common ground with the, you know, the individuals that just
[03:21:05.520 --> 03:21:09.920]  want to mutilate the genitals of children. Like, yeah, you know, let's just find common
[03:21:09.920 --> 03:21:14.960]  ground with those people. So we could just sit there and shake their hands and, you know,
[03:21:14.960 --> 03:21:19.119]  make it look like we're friends while they continue to mutilate the genitals of children.
[03:21:19.119 --> 03:21:26.400]  No, no, no, hell no. Why do you say that, Drew? The reason why I say that is because
[03:21:26.400 --> 03:21:33.920]  like Alex and I just got done talking about in the last segment, this is good, righteous
[03:21:34.880 --> 03:21:41.920]  versus evil, immorality, degeneracy, and total wickedness. There is no middle ground.
[03:21:42.560 --> 03:21:46.320]  We want to talk about Christ. Christ made it very clear. You're neither hot or cold.
[03:21:47.199 --> 03:21:53.279]  You're lukewarm. I will spew you out of my mouth. Christ said, you are either with me or you are
[03:21:53.279 --> 03:22:02.720]  against me. Why is that so black and white? Why is that so a 50 50? Because Jesus Christ is the
[03:22:02.720 --> 03:22:11.840]  standard of ultimate truth, the way the truth and the life. He is the pillar of all that is true.
[03:22:11.840 --> 03:22:17.760]  And that is reality. Everything that he is, everything that he says, everything that he
[03:22:17.760 --> 03:22:25.199]  has created, engineered in the universe, the multidimension world that we cannot see,
[03:22:25.199 --> 03:22:30.400]  only the dimension we can see up to three dimensions, everything that Christ has
[03:22:30.400 --> 03:22:36.160]  instituted, every all the principles that Christ has unleashed and revealed to humanity,
[03:22:36.160 --> 03:22:41.440]  all that he says goes. It's very simple for humanity to understand.
[03:22:43.039 --> 03:22:48.800]  And I think this is a perfect. And when I say perfect, I want people to understand.
[03:22:49.760 --> 03:22:54.240]  We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against spiritual hosts of wickedness, powers,
[03:22:54.240 --> 03:23:01.840]  evil powers, OK, that are that are mobilizing and weaponizing the deep state, the New World Order,
[03:23:02.560 --> 03:23:07.119]  the World Economic Forum, the Klaus Schwab's of the world, the Bill Gates of the world,
[03:23:07.119 --> 03:23:13.119]  the Adam Schiff's of the world, the weaponized FBI, CIA, you name it.
[03:23:14.000 --> 03:23:19.920]  All of this that you're seeing, this is all an agenda. People might sit here and say,
[03:23:19.920 --> 03:23:25.199]  how could this be coordinated across the entire board? Is humanity really that advanced? Well,
[03:23:25.199 --> 03:23:30.880]  yes, it would not be that hard. But at the same time, these demons and these spiritual hosts of
[03:23:30.880 --> 03:23:35.760]  wickedness are extremely advanced and they coordinate everything because they never sleep.
[03:23:35.760 --> 03:23:42.160]  They never rest. They never take a break. They're always watching, always working,
[03:23:42.160 --> 03:23:47.359]  always moving forward, always working against your children, manipulating their minds,
[03:23:47.359 --> 03:23:52.880]  manipulating the masses, pumping propaganda, pumping lies, pumping wickedness,
[03:23:52.880 --> 03:23:58.400]  pumping perversion. They never stop, never sleep, never rest.
[03:23:59.680 --> 03:24:05.119]  So what are you doing, Drew? I ask myself that every single day when I sit here and say we
[03:24:05.119 --> 03:24:13.359]  need Jesus for that specific reason alone. OK, you want to go to war. You cannot go to war without
[03:24:13.359 --> 03:24:18.640]  Jesus Christ or the spirit of God. I'll give you a perfect example of how the deep state functions,
[03:24:19.199 --> 03:24:22.080]  how they weaponize the DHS, how they weaponize the FBI.
[03:24:23.440 --> 03:24:27.119]  This is ABC News. All right, I'm going to show you guys this, because here we are, what,
[03:24:27.119 --> 03:24:32.240]  maybe like two weeks out from Groomer Month. Yes, I said Groomer Month. All right. All the
[03:24:32.240 --> 03:24:39.359]  pedophilia is coming out, being protected by that damn flag on the verge of Groomer
[03:24:39.359 --> 03:24:47.840]  Month. And you're starting to see this. It's increasing. ABC News threats against the LGBTQIA
[03:24:47.840 --> 03:24:54.160]  plus community intensifying, says the Department of Homeland Security, the DHS.
[03:24:55.680 --> 03:25:02.160]  Anti-LGBTQIA plus legislation has been introduced in recent months. Threats of violence against
[03:25:02.160 --> 03:25:08.160]  LGBTQIA plus community are on the rise and intensifying, according to a new briefing
[03:25:08.800 --> 03:25:12.560]  by the Department of Homeland Security. Pay attention to this and pay attention to the
[03:25:12.560 --> 03:25:20.000]  warning in the report. The DHS documented, the DHS document distributed to government and law
[03:25:20.000 --> 03:25:27.440]  enforcement agencies on May 11th. Okay. It's been distributed to government and law enforcement
[03:25:27.440 --> 03:25:35.039]  agencies, said that domestic violence and domestic violence extremists and people who
[03:25:35.039 --> 03:25:41.440]  commit hate crimes have increased threats of violence against the LGBTQIA plus community
[03:25:41.440 --> 03:25:46.960]  within the last year. With all of the grooming increasing in the past year, year and a half,
[03:25:46.960 --> 03:25:53.279]  right? All the pedophilia being pushed. It's gone into overdrive, accelerated. And here comes the
[03:25:53.279 --> 03:26:01.279]  DHS alerting all law enforcement. Hey, hate crimes are coming our way. Gotta protect the pedophiles.
[03:26:01.279 --> 03:26:04.480]  You see how they do this? It doesn't stop there. Listen to what the report said.
[03:26:05.199 --> 03:26:11.279]  These issues include actions linked to drag-themed events. These are quotes from the report.
[03:26:11.279 --> 03:26:18.560]  These issues and possible attacks on the LGBTQIA, whatever the hell, alphabet, mafia,
[03:26:18.560 --> 03:26:26.400]  skittle people community. These issues, the DHS says, include actions, threats linked to drag-themed
[03:26:26.400 --> 03:26:37.680]  events, gender affirming care, and LGBTQIA plus curricula in school. That's a quote from the DHS.
[03:26:38.240 --> 03:26:43.520]  You want to know what that includes? That includes drag-themed events,
[03:26:44.640 --> 03:26:53.119]  drag queen pedo time, drag queen pedo shows where children are sitting there being introduced to
[03:26:53.119 --> 03:26:59.039]  male genitalia swinging like a helicopter while these woke moms are sitting there with their
[03:26:59.039 --> 03:27:04.000]  babies bouncing on their laps like it's totally amazing and good for their children.
[03:27:04.960 --> 03:27:09.359]  That's exactly what the DHS is saying. Oh, drag-themed events, you mean like drag queen
[03:27:09.359 --> 03:27:16.080]  pedo time where some sex offender that's masquerading like an obnoxious depiction of
[03:27:16.080 --> 03:27:21.279]  a woman, mentally ill, perverted, is sitting there reading perverted pornographic books
[03:27:21.279 --> 03:27:26.800]  about little boys getting an erection at the age of three, four, five years old to little kids
[03:27:26.800 --> 03:27:30.960]  bouncing on their laps while they get an erection at the same time? Yeah, yeah,
[03:27:31.920 --> 03:27:37.039]  you can't speak out against that. The DHS doesn't like what I'm saying because what I'm saying now
[03:27:37.039 --> 03:27:43.119]  is considered a violent extremist threat because I take issue with groomers and pedophiles that
[03:27:43.119 --> 03:27:50.080]  are going after children and they do it hiding behind that damn flag. It's accelerating,
[03:27:50.080 --> 03:27:56.400]  ladies and gentlemen. It's accelerating and getting worse. The protected class system is a sham
[03:27:56.400 --> 03:28:01.760]  and it's only going to get worse. And then they say violent extremists are coming
[03:28:02.320 --> 03:28:08.720]  because they're opposing gender-affirming care. And what do they call gender-affirming care class?
[03:28:08.720 --> 03:28:15.920]  Mutilating genitals of little kids, making micropenises, chopping a little boy's penis off,
[03:28:15.920 --> 03:28:22.800]  taking skin from the thigh and making a fake neopenis that falls off in the next six months
[03:28:22.800 --> 03:28:30.160]  to a year. Total mutilization. You can't speak out against that now because now you're an
[03:28:30.160 --> 03:28:37.119]  extremist if you take issue with little kids getting their genitals mutilated. The DHS is
[03:28:37.119 --> 03:28:42.480]  going to come after you. And of course, this is being distributed to law enforcement agencies,
[03:28:42.480 --> 03:28:48.960]  which which I'll give you a guess who those are. I don't know. Maybe the FBI, maybe the CIA. I mean,
[03:28:48.960 --> 03:28:52.960]  how far does this really go where now you're getting a knock on your door if you speak out
[03:28:52.960 --> 03:29:00.720]  against perverts and pedophiles? Ridiculous. Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists
[03:29:00.720 --> 03:29:04.480]  were going to move against Tucker Carlson and take him off the air. People said no way he's the most
[03:29:04.480 --> 03:29:08.960]  pop would ever happen. They've got quadrillions of stolen money. They only had Tucker Carlson on
[03:29:08.960 --> 03:29:12.320]  the air because they believe they can control him. But as soon as they figured out they couldn't,
[03:29:12.320 --> 03:29:17.920]  he was taken off the air. It's the same thing with Infowars. But Infowars is not owned by Fox
[03:29:17.920 --> 03:29:24.000]  or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan. We are only beholden to our
[03:29:24.000 --> 03:29:29.520]  viewers and our listeners. And when you support us, we're unstoppable. I'm not underwritten by
[03:29:29.520 --> 03:29:36.240]  Rupert Murdoch or by George Soros. I'm underwritten by you, which is we the people.
[03:29:36.240 --> 03:29:39.439]  So I want to thank you for your support and encourage viewers and listeners understand.
[03:29:39.439 --> 03:29:44.640]  Please don't take Infowars for granted. We're barely hanging on. We need your word of mouth,
[03:29:44.720 --> 03:29:48.000]  your prayer, your financial support while getting great products at the same time
[03:29:48.000 --> 03:29:51.840]  at Infowarsstore.com. So don't procrastinate. Go to Infowarsstore.com,
[03:29:51.840 --> 03:29:56.000]  get amazing products that keep us on the air and never submit to these tyrants.
[03:29:57.760 --> 03:30:02.640]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had. I don't think anybody can deny it.
[03:30:03.279 --> 03:30:08.320]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. When we talk about the crew
[03:30:08.320 --> 03:30:13.760]  at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have
[03:30:13.760 --> 03:30:18.720]  been the MVPs in this fight. And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard
[03:30:18.720 --> 03:30:24.080]  work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[03:30:24.960 --> 03:30:27.920]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[03:30:28.560 --> 03:30:33.199]  I want to encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not
[03:30:33.199 --> 03:30:37.360]  support us. I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing
[03:30:37.360 --> 03:30:42.560]  it. But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com, and you never buy great
[03:30:42.560 --> 03:30:46.960]  products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keep us on air. I know that less
[03:30:46.960 --> 03:30:52.400]  than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com. If just 1% more of you took
[03:30:52.400 --> 03:30:56.640]  action and went to Infowarsstore.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[03:30:56.640 --> 03:31:03.920]  Hydrofluorosilicic acid is the third most deadly acid on earth, and they've got our children
[03:31:03.920 --> 03:31:10.320]  drinking that. This is a psychotic death cult, period, case closed, out to get you and your
[03:31:10.320 --> 03:31:16.080]  family. We sell the Alexa Pure Breeze made by the My Patron Supply Ready Hour group. It's been
[03:31:16.080 --> 03:31:20.320]  around about 15 years, became the biggest company in the last six. They went out, hired engineers,
[03:31:20.320 --> 03:31:25.039]  reverse engineered the fancy best water filter system out there that sells for twice the price,
[03:31:25.039 --> 03:31:30.720]  and they made it as good in all the studies. It reduces things to non-detectable levels,
[03:31:30.720 --> 03:31:34.480]  thousands of chemicals. But you can go pay two or three times. There's four or five other filters
[03:31:34.480 --> 03:31:40.000]  out there that are just as good. We sell the very best highest grade water filtration system for half
[03:31:40.000 --> 03:31:46.000]  the price to leading competitor, and the media says we're bad and a cult for telling you you
[03:31:46.000 --> 03:31:49.520]  should filter your water. You should also filter your shower water. That's another way you absorb
[03:31:49.520 --> 03:31:54.320]  this crap, but I'm done talking about that. The point is you get the filters at Infowarsstore.com.
[03:31:54.320 --> 03:31:58.560]  They're discounted right now. Finally back in stock. Please give me one minute of your time.
[03:31:59.119 --> 03:32:04.560]  Please write this down, and please go look this up. It will change your life. The UN admits,
[03:32:04.560 --> 03:32:08.800]  and the Lansing Medical Journal admits, that upwards of two billion people have mental
[03:32:08.800 --> 03:32:15.119]  disabilities and declining cognitive abilities. The term they use is intellectual disability
[03:32:15.119 --> 03:32:21.119]  because of lack of iodine. Most iodine in the environment is bound to other elements,
[03:32:21.119 --> 03:32:27.520]  so your body can't absorb it. Only pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells,
[03:32:27.520 --> 03:32:34.640]  and Infowarsstore.com has the only iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect.
[03:32:34.640 --> 03:32:39.039]  Ladies and gentlemen, X3's been sold out for six months. It's very hard to produce,
[03:32:39.039 --> 03:32:43.600]  and it's finally back in stock. In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad.
[03:32:43.600 --> 03:32:49.360]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful. You and your family need it. It's 25% off back in stock.
[03:32:49.360 --> 03:32:56.240]  X3 triiodine exclusively at Infowarsstore.com. Take action now, but regardless, research is info.
[03:32:57.520 --> 03:33:06.080]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:06.300 --> 03:33:24.140]  By the way, this DHS report that's being distributed to law enforcement agencies saying that attacks
[03:33:24.140 --> 03:33:32.460]  and extremists are targeting more frequently the LGBTQ plus alphabet mafia, skittle people.
[03:33:33.099 --> 03:33:38.939]  And by the way, the report does not only say that drag themed events are being targeted,
[03:33:40.300 --> 03:33:45.740]  gender affirming care believers are being targeted, but it also says
[03:33:47.660 --> 03:33:55.740]  LGBTQI plus curricula in schools. What does that mean? So if a mom or a dad takes issue,
[03:33:55.740 --> 03:34:01.900]  according to the DHS, the mom or a dad takes issue with some teacher coming out
[03:34:03.179 --> 03:34:08.060]  and not telling you that they're having a conversation exclusively and privately
[03:34:08.699 --> 03:34:15.980]  about your son. Hey, little boy. Have you ever thought about being a homosexual? Yeah.
[03:34:17.420 --> 03:34:20.699]  What do you think about that? Have you ever thought that you're gay, little boy?
[03:34:20.699 --> 03:34:26.699]  Huh? You attracted to other boys? Hey, little Timmy, you see a little Johnny over there?
[03:34:26.699 --> 03:34:30.939]  Are you attracted to him? What does that mean, teacher? Well, I mean,
[03:34:31.420 --> 03:34:37.660]  take a look at him. Are you attracted to his body? Do you, I don't know, maybe you want to
[03:34:37.660 --> 03:34:43.179]  touch his penis? I mean, that means you're gay. Do you have a sexual attraction? Oh,
[03:34:43.179 --> 03:34:49.340]  hey, little girl. Hey, little Cindy. Hey, you have thoughts? You see Wendy over there?
[03:34:49.900 --> 03:34:59.740]  Are you attracted to her? Do you like her chest? So if they come out and they talk like that in
[03:34:59.740 --> 03:35:03.900]  schools and then they'll just hide and they'll hide and say, well, well, no, no, no. You're
[03:35:03.900 --> 03:35:11.340]  saying that I can't say gay. You're saying that I can't say gay. Oh, no, no, no. You're saying I,
[03:35:11.340 --> 03:35:19.980]  I, I can't talk about homosexuality to, to my children, my children in my classroom, mom and
[03:35:19.980 --> 03:35:27.099]  dad. I can't have a conversation about your kindergarten or sexual attractions. You're a
[03:35:27.099 --> 03:35:33.019]  bigot. I can't talk to little Timothy if he's a homosexual or not, or little Cindy,
[03:35:33.019 --> 03:35:39.099]  if she's into scissoring, like I am, I'm not allowed to do that. You are a bigot.
[03:35:39.099 --> 03:35:45.980]  You are an extremist. You are anti LGBTQ curricula. That's how they hide. That's the
[03:35:45.980 --> 03:35:52.859]  sign up. That's how they get you. And they say, oh, well, you're just against the LGBTQ teachings
[03:35:52.859 --> 03:35:58.619]  in school. Like, oh yeah. But if I, if I say the word Jesus in front of a first grader,
[03:35:58.619 --> 03:36:03.820]  all of the entire world is going to burn down. If we quote the 10 commandments and tell little
[03:36:03.820 --> 03:36:09.179]  kids that they shouldn't kill people, that's oppressive. We're so scared. Oh my God.
[03:36:09.179 --> 03:36:14.300]  Put a stop to that separation of church and state, but don't separate the pedophiles and
[03:36:14.300 --> 03:36:20.220]  the groomers from little kids. No, we need pedophiles. We need groomers with little kids,
[03:36:20.220 --> 03:36:28.619]  not Jesus or righteousness. What a joke. What a joke, dude. Absolute cuckery,
[03:36:28.619 --> 03:36:35.340]  evil wickedness, ridiculous. I cannot believe that there are people on planet earth that sit
[03:36:35.340 --> 03:36:40.699]  here and say, oh, oh, oh my God, it's the worst thing in the universe for little kids to hear
[03:36:40.699 --> 03:36:45.580]  about the greatest human being that ever walked the face of planet earth. That is totally perfect,
[03:36:45.580 --> 03:36:48.140]  righteous, and can teach you how to be a good person.
[03:36:49.179 --> 03:36:53.019]  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. But the deep state in the new world order says
[03:36:53.019 --> 03:36:58.220]  we can push our gay stuff. We can push our queer stuff. We can teach little kids,
[03:36:58.220 --> 03:37:06.939]  you know, about sodomy. Yes. Sodomy and how to spread STDs and AIDS and HIV. Oh yeah.
[03:37:06.939 --> 03:37:13.259]  We could talk about that. Our LGBTQ curricula. Cause you cannot talk about LGBTQ without
[03:37:13.259 --> 03:37:19.179]  talking about gay sex. Oh yeah. Little girl, we're going to teach you how to scissor Cindy
[03:37:19.179 --> 03:37:25.420]  over there. That's what we're going to teach you. Cause that's LGBTQ. Yeah. Teaching.
[03:37:26.300 --> 03:37:31.820]  I'm sick of it. I'm sick of it. All the cucks out there that just do not understand this,
[03:37:33.019 --> 03:37:37.420]  that do not understand how these people are pushing their pedophilia while trying to tell
[03:37:37.420 --> 03:37:42.140]  you that pushing something that's righteous is like oppressive and evil and wrong.
[03:37:42.140 --> 03:37:48.779]  You are a part of the problem. You are a part of the problem. You are a part of the problem
[03:37:48.779 --> 03:37:56.619]  with your separation of church and state garbage. We need God. We need God in everything,
[03:37:56.619 --> 03:38:02.460]  everything. We need him, his principles, especially if we're going to protect children.
[03:38:02.700 --> 03:38:13.900]  The parents are the ones losing their rights. The parents have the rights. And this woke
[03:38:13.900 --> 03:38:19.100]  pedophile mob are attempting to separate you from your children. Why do you think, I think
[03:38:19.100 --> 03:38:25.500]  we have the clip, if the crew has the clip, why do you think pedo-Biden is making statements
[03:38:25.500 --> 03:38:31.380]  that children belong to everybody? Kamala Harris saying, oh, the children belong to
[03:38:31.380 --> 03:38:36.100]  the community. White House press secretary comes out and says, oh, well, you know, these
[03:38:36.100 --> 03:38:41.420]  are our children. There are children when talking about trans kids. Trans kids are not
[03:38:41.420 --> 03:38:47.860]  real because trans people do not exist. It's a figment of their imagination, gender dysphoria.
[03:38:47.860 --> 03:38:53.140]  It's not real. They're all just homosexuals and lesbians. Take a look at this clip. This
[03:38:53.140 --> 03:38:58.740]  is why they're saying stuff like this. There's no such thing as someone else's child. No
[03:38:58.740 --> 03:39:05.100]  such thing as someone else's child. Our nation's children are all our children. These are kids.
[03:39:05.100 --> 03:39:10.820]  These are our kids. They belong to all of us. When we talk about the children of the community,
[03:39:10.820 --> 03:39:16.700]  they are the children of the community.
[03:39:16.700 --> 03:39:24.780]  They are our kids, our kids, mom, your baby, your son, your daughter belongs to pedo Joe.
[03:39:24.780 --> 03:39:31.460]  All right. All right. Your little kid belongs to Kamala Harris. All right. Cackling Kamala
[03:39:31.460 --> 03:39:37.860]  Harris that I slept her way to the top. Right. Oh, yeah. But that's the new world order.
[03:39:37.860 --> 03:39:42.460]  That's how lawlessness will abound. That's why there's an attack on the nuclear family.
[03:39:42.460 --> 03:39:46.500]  That's a thought of Western civilization. No, that's a thought that was hatched from
[03:39:46.500 --> 03:39:50.420]  God himself for humanity to function and procreate.
[03:39:50.420 --> 03:39:55.620]  Isn't it interesting how it's always like the homosexuals and like I said, trans are
[03:39:55.620 --> 03:39:59.340]  not real. It's all just homosexuals. They're all coming out and saying your children belong
[03:39:59.340 --> 03:40:05.380]  to us. And then the puppets that regurgitate that, like the Joe Biden's and the Kamala
[03:40:05.380 --> 03:40:07.860]  Harris is White House press secretary.
[03:40:07.860 --> 03:40:16.020]  All the homosexuals are always coming out saying that your children belong to us. Why? Why?
[03:40:16.060 --> 03:40:22.740]  Because they cannot have a future. Here's the biological reality of homosexuality. OK,
[03:40:22.740 --> 03:40:31.540]  let's just let's just be honest here. They have no biological procreating. Reality or
[03:40:31.540 --> 03:40:41.380]  chance or abilities for the future. At all. At all. So so why has this community. Hyper
[03:40:41.380 --> 03:40:49.620]  sexualized have openly come out now and are all in unison, always saying that your children
[03:40:49.620 --> 03:40:55.220]  belong to them, violating the rights of the parents, violating the rights of everyone
[03:40:55.220 --> 03:41:02.060]  that opposes it? Why? Because it's the only way they could have children. That or if they
[03:41:02.060 --> 03:41:06.500]  just steal the wombs of women, which they they hate women, which isn't a which is which
[03:41:06.500 --> 03:41:10.540]  is insane to me, because that's just bypassing God's design.
[03:41:10.540 --> 03:41:17.300]  If you're just bypassing God's design by hijacking the womb of a woman. To keep your homosexual
[03:41:17.300 --> 03:41:23.980]  so-called gay marriage afloat, that is an abomination as well. God does not honor that.
[03:41:23.980 --> 03:41:27.920]  If we are going to be in obedience to God, we have to tell the truth. What I'm telling
[03:41:27.920 --> 03:41:34.460]  you are not my thoughts. These are his thoughts. He created the world. He created the universe.
[03:41:34.460 --> 03:41:40.340]  He created all of this. He knows better than me. This is where humanity has to humble themselves
[03:41:40.340 --> 03:41:45.660]  and be in obedience and submit to what he has said. Why are we in this position where
[03:41:45.660 --> 03:41:51.060]  all these people are coming out and claiming that your kids belong to them? It's very simple.
[03:41:51.060 --> 03:41:57.980]  It's the only way. It's the only way to have some kind of stable looking little, you know,
[03:41:57.980 --> 03:42:04.220]  home life with a family and have children. They have to take your kids. They have to
[03:42:04.220 --> 03:42:10.460]  take your children. There's no other way. There's no other way around it. There's no
[03:42:10.460 --> 03:42:17.580]  other way of getting around this. All right. Like I said, good, evil. You choose a side.
[03:42:17.580 --> 03:42:23.460]  You choose a side. What God says is good. Anything in opposition towards what God says
[03:42:23.460 --> 03:42:30.540]  that is evil because that is what Satan represents and loves opposition towards God and not what
[03:42:30.540 --> 03:42:38.580]  God believes. This is what God has established. All right. This is what God has established.
[03:42:38.580 --> 03:42:44.780]  God doesn't have an opinion, ladies and gentlemen. God is fact. God is love. God is truth. God
[03:42:44.780 --> 03:42:51.180]  is reality. And we must submit to that. If not, then you're just living in your own fantasy.
[03:42:51.180 --> 03:42:55.660]  Well, go hang out with all the so-called trans homosexuals and pedophiles. Look what
[03:42:55.660 --> 03:43:00.580]  they're doing. Please give me one minute of your time. Please write this down and please
[03:43:00.580 --> 03:43:05.780]  go look this up. It will change your life. The U.N. admits in the Lansing Medical Journal
[03:43:05.780 --> 03:43:11.620]  admits that upwards of two billion people have mental disabilities and declining cognitive
[03:43:11.620 --> 03:43:17.740]  abilities. The term they use is intellectual disability because of lack of iodine. Most
[03:43:17.740 --> 03:43:23.660]  iodine in the environment is bound to other elements so your body can't absorb it. Only
[03:43:23.660 --> 03:43:30.060]  pure iodine can really be absorbed right into the cells. And InfoWarsTore.com has the only
[03:43:30.060 --> 03:43:36.140]  iodine out there that actually has this type of full effect. Ladies and gentlemen, X3 has
[03:43:36.140 --> 03:43:40.940]  been sold out for six months. It's very hard to produce. And it's finally back in stock.
[03:43:40.940 --> 03:43:46.100]  In fact, I was just taking some before I shot this ad. This, ladies and gentlemen, is powerful.

[03:44:09.100 --> 03:44:14.340]  you. Humanity has a real fighting chance. I just want to thank you all for buying products

[03:44:56.500 --> 03:45:01.260]  Ladies and gentlemen, the truth, the solution is laying right there in front of you hidden
[03:45:01.260 --> 03:45:06.860]  in plain view. Please listen to me in the next 60 seconds. If you go to Wikipedia, it
[03:45:06.860 --> 03:45:12.500]  has links to the UN's own website where they admit the number one cause of cognitive disability
[03:45:12.500 --> 03:45:19.220]  in the world is iodine deficiency. The number one preventable cause of intellectual disability
[03:45:19.220 --> 03:45:26.100]  is lack of real pure iodine in the body as they bomb us with the bad halogens, bromine,
[03:45:26.100 --> 03:45:31.820]  bromide, chlorine and so much more. Upwards of 2 billion people in a Lancet Medical Journal
[03:45:31.820 --> 03:45:38.860]  study in 2007 worldwide have cognitive disabilities because they don't have high quality iodine.
[03:45:38.860 --> 03:45:42.860]  Most iodine is bound to other elements. You don't absorb it. We have X3, all three types
[03:45:42.860 --> 03:45:48.940]  of the good iodine together that supercharges your body. X3 is now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[03:45:48.940 --> 03:45:55.580]  It's being sold out for over six months for 25% off. X3 back in stock. Take action now.

[03:45:56.580 --> 03:46:01.060]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World is a historic book
[03:46:01.060 --> 03:46:05.460]  that documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future. That is a hellish
[03:46:05.460 --> 03:46:09.100]  future. Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting
[03:46:09.100 --> 03:46:13.140]  to ban them, be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at
[03:46:13.140 --> 03:46:17.540]  bookstores, Amazon or InfoWarsTore.com. But you will never be able to get another signed
[03:46:17.540 --> 03:46:22.340]  copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out. And there's about a thousand
[03:46:22.340 --> 03:46:26.900]  left of them right now. So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World
[03:46:27.860 --> 03:46:32.260]  at InfoWarsTore.com. And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep
[03:46:32.260 --> 03:46:36.340]  us on the air. So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book. You'll
[03:46:36.340 --> 03:46:40.020]  also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air. I want to thank those of you that have
[03:46:40.020 --> 03:46:44.660]  gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies. But I want to encourage all of you
[03:46:44.660 --> 03:46:49.300]  who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsTore.com and get a signed copy and buy a couple of
[03:46:49.300 --> 03:46:53.540]  unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the local school. This is
[03:46:53.540 --> 03:46:56.020]  an InfoWar. I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:46:56.900 --> 03:47:05.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.

[03:47:45.820 --> 03:47:54.720]  Guys, this stuff is not stopping anytime soon, all right, it's not stopping anytime soon,
[03:47:54.720 --> 03:47:57.860]  and people always say, you know, the cucks, right, it's always the cucks, the cucks are
[03:47:57.860 --> 03:48:03.940]  like, Drew, you need to be nice, you need to be nice, your yelling is so mean, oh my

[03:48:19.740 --> 03:48:29.980]  up, shut up, shut up, shut up, enough, enough with that, people are so sick of that mentality,
[03:48:29.980 --> 03:48:35.420]  I can feel it, I can feel it, I'm not the only one, even though you might feel like
[03:48:35.420 --> 03:48:39.260]  you're alone, that's why they censor everybody off of the face of planet Earth, you want
[03:48:39.260 --> 03:48:45.820]  to know why, because they want you to feel like you are alone, like you don't belong,
[03:48:45.820 --> 03:48:51.740]  they want you to feel like you are the minority, that your beliefs are outdated and extreme,
[03:48:51.740 --> 03:48:57.420]  that's why they nuke anyone on the face of the internet that's starting to populate,
[03:48:57.420 --> 03:49:02.900]  that starts to see the same things and that believes and starts to say all the same things
[03:49:02.900 --> 03:49:07.740]  because they want to put an end to that, that's what the new world order fears, that's what
[03:49:07.740 --> 03:49:12.660]  the globalists fear, why do you think they fear info wars, why do you think they fear
[03:49:12.660 --> 03:49:19.700]  banned out video, why do you think they fear Alex Jones, why, why, why, why, why, because
[03:49:19.700 --> 03:49:26.660]  we wake people up, we wake people up, you wake people up, sharing information, speaking
[03:49:26.660 --> 03:49:31.620]  truth to power, why do they want to censor us, why do the attacks never stop, why do
[03:49:31.620 --> 03:49:41.460]  these people never sleep, relentlessly trying to put a stop to us, because we are gathering,
[03:49:41.460 --> 03:49:47.940]  we are populating, we are growing while they try to push with their propaganda that we're
[03:49:47.940 --> 03:49:54.500]  not, that's what they fear, they fear the populace, they fear you and me, they fear
[03:49:54.500 --> 03:50:00.940]  us, they are the ones that are truly afraid, that's why everything is a damn phobia to
[03:50:00.940 --> 03:50:06.780]  these people, why do you think they're always calling you phobia this, phobic that, where
[03:50:06.780 --> 03:50:11.540]  we at now, fat phobia, I don't know where we are right now, when I was a kid all I ever
[03:50:11.540 --> 03:50:18.500]  heard was Islamophobia, Islamophobia, stupid puppet Obama on the TV telling Americans we
[03:50:18.500 --> 03:50:23.380]  should be nice to the terrorists now, do you guys remember that, I totally remember that
[03:50:23.380 --> 03:50:28.620]  when I was a kid, I remember the day sitting there watching Obama telling America we need
[03:50:28.620 --> 03:50:34.260]  to stop using the term radical Islamic terrorism, you guys remember that, gosh I remember even
[03:50:34.260 --> 03:50:38.580]  being a kid seeing that stuff and thinking to myself, who the hell is this guy, what
[03:50:38.820 --> 03:50:43.540]  are you talking about, these people hate us, are you talking about Obama, are you talking
[03:50:43.540 --> 03:50:50.340]  about the people that chant death to America, death to me, death to my existence, death
[03:50:50.340 --> 03:50:58.260]  to my family, death to my lineage, my future and I'm supposed to sit here and just be like

[03:51:42.940 --> 03:51:48.700]  the World Health Organization sex education about early childhood masturbation ladies
[03:51:48.700 --> 03:51:55.340]  and gentlemen and gender identities, this is all LGBTQ nonsense for under children the
[03:51:55.460 --> 03:52:03.660]  age of four, this is real, World Health Organization ladies and gentlemen, globalist regime, the
[03:52:03.660 --> 03:52:08.660]  World Health Organization is being urged to withdraw a disturbing guidance to schools
[03:52:08.660 --> 03:52:15.500]  about sexuality education for young children, the program encourages kids under the age
[03:52:15.500 --> 03:52:25.820]  of four years old to quote ask questions about sexuality and explore gender identities
[03:52:25.820 --> 03:52:32.840]  to two and three year olds, hell yeah, the globalist and the pedophiles say, the official
[03:52:32.840 --> 03:52:39.580]  guidance also supports providing information to kids under the age of four about quote
[03:52:39.620 --> 03:52:48.220]  enjoyment and pleasure when touching one's own body, each early childhood and teaching
[03:52:48.220 --> 03:52:54.100]  excuse me, early childhood masturbation, those are quotes ladies and gentlemen, World Health

[03:53:05.660 --> 03:53:12.100]  about how to touch themselves and please themselves and early childhood masturbation
[03:53:12.100 --> 03:53:20.580]  all in the name of LGBTQ, oh yes, let's explore your gender, let's explore your sexuality
[03:53:20.580 --> 03:53:25.780]  because yes, that's gonna make you a better person and that's gonna make us feel better,
[03:53:25.780 --> 03:53:29.300]  you wanna know, listen, listen, let me take you into the psychology and in the mind of
[03:53:29.300 --> 03:53:34.460]  one of these groomer pedophiles, you wanna know why they think they're on the right side?
[03:53:34.460 --> 03:53:39.580]  Because they're so totally depraved and void of morality, void, they're gone, these people
[03:53:39.580 --> 03:53:45.620]  are gone, okay, they have no gauge but in their heads, they've been convinced that they're
[03:53:45.620 --> 03:53:50.520]  on the right side, that they're on the good side, they're so depraved and perverted in
[03:53:50.520 --> 03:53:55.820]  their minds that they actually think yes, teaching four year olds and three year olds
[03:53:55.820 --> 03:54:03.460]  and two year olds that masturbation is a good thing for society, we're helping children,
[03:54:03.460 --> 03:54:08.380]  I'm not saying that they're excused from their wickedness, don't get it twisted, pedophiles
[03:54:08.380 --> 03:54:16.340]  legally and lawfully deserve the death penalty immediately, child molesters, child predators,
[03:54:16.340 --> 03:54:24.600]  death penalty legally, lawfully, immediately, immediately, immediately, immediately, why?
[03:54:24.600 --> 03:54:30.100]  Because it communicates to a society that that crap ain't gonna fly here, it ain't gonna
[03:54:30.100 --> 03:54:36.940]  fly here, man, but no, society is so cucked out, the World Health Organization, mom, alright,
[03:54:36.940 --> 03:54:45.060]  the same who that is pushing forced inoculations, unelected, making recommendations, bureaucrats
[03:54:45.060 --> 03:54:50.260]  to the federal government, the governments of the world that you must be jabbed multiple
[03:54:50.260 --> 03:54:57.820]  times or you can't access the economy or have a job, yeah, that same globalist who is targeting
[03:54:57.820 --> 03:55:07.300]  your children under the age of four to teach them how to masturbate and please themselves,
[03:55:07.300 --> 03:55:13.860]  I mean, you really gotta think to yourself, what kind of sick freak would sit in a classroom,
[03:55:13.860 --> 03:55:21.380]  I don't know, of maybe five, 20, three, four, five year olds, kindergarten, preschool, sit
[03:55:21.380 --> 03:55:29.260]  in a classroom, and by the way, these teachings are being distributed, sit in a classroom,
[03:55:29.260 --> 03:55:37.740]  look at a group of children and think to themselves, today's lesson, ladies and gentlemen, today's
[03:55:37.740 --> 03:55:44.300]  lesson, little kids, we're gonna teach you how to touch yourselves, I mean, it's like
[03:55:44.300 --> 03:55:48.260]  you and I are adults, right, like you and I are adults and we sit here and like, whoa,
[03:55:48.260 --> 03:55:51.620]  teaching kids how to please themselves, masturbate, little kids don't know what the hell that
[03:55:51.620 --> 03:55:59.500]  means, how do little kids learn, especially at the age of two, three, and four class,
[03:55:59.500 --> 03:56:05.980]  how do little kids learn, especially if they're not speaking English or their native language
[03:56:05.980 --> 03:56:10.140]  as great as they can, that's why they're in preschool, that's why they're in kindergarten,
[03:56:10.140 --> 03:56:15.460]  they're learning their ABCs, they're learning basics in order to be able to raise their
[03:56:15.460 --> 03:56:22.540]  IQs and learn and advance further down the line, how do you really teach a preschooler
[03:56:22.540 --> 03:56:28.900]  or a kindergartner how to please themselves and how to masturbate?
[03:56:28.900 --> 03:56:35.620]  I'm asking the WHO this, I'm asking the World Health Organization this, you don't take textbooks,
[03:56:35.620 --> 03:56:41.180]  you don't take a curriculum and just put it on the wall, yes, these perverts are showing
[03:56:41.180 --> 03:56:48.620]  children pornography, which is horrible and evil, but children are visual, especially
[03:56:48.620 --> 03:56:53.860]  at that age, they're visual learners, they're not going to be taught directly these gigantic
[03:56:53.860 --> 03:57:01.060]  words straight out of a book, and these groomers know this, the World Health Organization,
[03:57:01.060 --> 03:57:07.500]  these pedophiles and globalist groomers, they know what I'm saying, they know that the only
[03:57:07.500 --> 03:57:14.180]  way to teach a three, two, four-year-old how to masturbate and please themselves is
[03:57:14.180 --> 03:57:24.180]  if you physically show them, mom, physically show them, dad, these people are Satan, okay?
[03:57:24.180 --> 03:57:32.020]  These people are evil, these people need to be taken care of legally and lawfully, death
[03:57:32.020 --> 03:57:38.340]  penalty for groomers and pedophiles legally and lawfully immediately.

[03:58:49.780 --> 03:58:57.220]  I want to say brain force is great, I want to say turbo force is amazing, it is, but
[03:58:57.220 --> 03:59:03.220]  if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it, the fish oil's better than
[03:59:03.220 --> 03:59:05.260]  it, and that's an example of what I'm talking about.
[03:59:05.260 --> 03:59:10.940]  Fish oil is liquid energy, brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there.
[03:59:10.940 --> 03:59:14.740]  Krill oil is the best, and it'll give you the damn burps, and I'm just sorry, you want
[03:59:14.740 --> 03:59:16.460]  something like this, you don't get stuff for free.
[03:59:16.460 --> 03:59:20.740]  The krill is hallucinogenic, it's so good, in my view, I'm not making a medical statement
[03:59:20.740 --> 03:59:24.140]  here, but let me tell you something, and I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go
[03:59:24.140 --> 03:59:28.060]  to bed, I'm seeing Santa Claus that night.
[03:59:28.060 --> 03:59:35.540]  So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[03:59:35.540 --> 03:59:38.980]  So we don't make a big profit off of it, but you notice I just obsess, because whatever
[03:59:38.980 --> 03:59:42.780]  the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you, I just can't do it!
