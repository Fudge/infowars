[00:00.000 --> 00:02.000]  If it was human it was not human
[00:03.840 --> 00:07.200]  Now the classic fear begins to grow
[00:09.800 --> 00:12.520]  In a modern masterpiece of science
[00:12.520 --> 00:39.520]  They're barricading the street. Invasion of the bodysaturs.
[00:39.520 --> 00:44.520]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:44.520 --> 00:47.520]  It's Monday, October 18th.
[00:57.520 --> 01:00.520]  There are of course those who do not want us to speak.
[01:00.520 --> 01:01.520]  We think just let me think.
[01:01.520 --> 01:04.520]  I expect even now orders are being shouted into telephones
[01:04.520 --> 01:06.520]  and men with guns will soon be on their way.
[01:06.520 --> 01:07.520]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[01:07.520 --> 01:08.520]  Damn it!
[01:08.520 --> 01:09.520]  Why?
[01:09.520 --> 01:12.520]  Because while the transmission may be used in lieu of conversation
[01:12.520 --> 01:15.520]  words will always retain their power.
[01:15.520 --> 01:19.520]  Words offer the means to meaning and for those who will listen
[01:19.520 --> 01:21.520]  the annunciations of truth.
[01:21.520 --> 01:26.520]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[01:26.520 --> 01:28.520]  You designed it, sir. You wanted it foolproof.
[01:28.520 --> 01:30.520]  You taught me every television in London.
[01:30.520 --> 01:34.520]  Cruelty and intolerance and oppression.
[01:34.520 --> 01:36.520]  And where once you have the freedom to object
[01:36.520 --> 01:38.520]  and to think and speak as you saw fit,
[01:38.520 --> 01:41.520]  you now have sensors and systems of surveillance
[01:41.520 --> 01:44.520]  coercing your conformity and suppressing your submachine.
[01:44.520 --> 01:45.520]  Where are the cameras?
[01:45.520 --> 01:46.520]  How did this happen?
[01:46.520 --> 01:48.520]  Who's to blame?
[01:48.520 --> 01:51.520]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[01:51.520 --> 01:53.520]  They will be held accountable.
[01:53.520 --> 01:56.520]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty,
[01:56.520 --> 01:59.520]  you need only look into a mirror.
[01:59.520 --> 02:01.520]  I know why you did it.
[02:01.520 --> 02:03.520]  I know you were afraid.
[02:03.520 --> 02:07.520]  Who are you to me? War, terror, disease?
[02:07.520 --> 02:11.520]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason
[02:11.520 --> 02:14.520]  and rob you of your common sense.
[02:14.520 --> 02:16.520]  Fear got the best of you.
[02:16.520 --> 02:21.520]  And in your panic, you turned to the now high Chancellor, Adam Sutler.
[02:21.520 --> 02:24.520]  He promised you border. He promised you peace.
[02:24.520 --> 02:34.520]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[02:34.520 --> 02:38.520]  There is a war. It's happening now.
[02:38.520 --> 02:40.520]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[02:40.520 --> 02:43.520]  The time to choose sides has come.
[02:43.520 --> 02:49.520]  We are the resistance. We are the Info War.
[02:49.520 --> 02:54.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, Colin Powell is dead,
[02:54.520 --> 02:56.520]  fully vaccinated with COVID-19,
[02:56.520 --> 03:00.520]  is dead from blowback of his own weapon system.
[03:00.520 --> 03:03.520]  Hitler, of course, helped fire nerve gas in World War I.
[03:03.520 --> 03:05.520]  It almost killed him.
[03:05.520 --> 03:08.520]  So, Colin Powell, a casualty, their own operation.
[03:08.520 --> 03:13.520]  Info War's emergency supply chain breakdown sale
[03:13.520 --> 03:20.520]  is only running for one week for a Monday, October 11th, for seven days.
[03:20.520 --> 03:25.520]  That's because a bunch of these products that we have in stock
[03:25.520 --> 03:29.520]  are limited supply because, obviously, the supply chain breakdown
[03:29.520 --> 03:32.520]  that I've been warning you of now for 20 months,
[03:32.520 --> 03:35.520]  because that's part of the great reset and part of the global's plan,
[03:35.520 --> 03:37.520]  and that's what global lockdowns have been triggered.
[03:37.520 --> 03:40.520]  So we've not lowered the quality of any of our products.
[03:40.520 --> 03:44.520]  Some of them have been sold out more than six months, like DNA Force Plus.
[03:44.520 --> 03:47.520]  It is 40% off, but coming up in one week,
[03:47.520 --> 03:49.520]  it will go back to full price,
[03:49.520 --> 03:53.520]  and we probably won't have more for up to six months, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:53.520 --> 03:55.520]  So it's a chance to support the broadcast,
[03:55.520 --> 03:57.520]  get incredible products at the same time.
[03:57.520 --> 03:59.520]  Winner, Sun, Ultra 12, they're both 50% off.
[03:59.520 --> 04:02.520]  They're going to go back to 10% off in a week as well.
[04:02.520 --> 04:04.520]  They're 50% off right now.
[04:04.520 --> 04:06.520]  Find these and more at infowarstore.com
[04:06.520 --> 04:10.520]  and fund the Info World, making your life a lot healthier.
[04:10.520 --> 04:14.520]  From the front lines of the Information War,
[04:14.520 --> 04:16.520]  it's Alex Jones.
[04:30.520 --> 04:34.520]  Well, here we are, ladies and gentlemen.
[04:34.520 --> 04:38.520]  On this live Monday, October 18th, 2021,
[04:38.520 --> 04:41.520]  Worldwide Transmission.
[04:41.520 --> 04:43.520]  We're going to be here for the next four hours,
[04:43.520 --> 04:46.520]  and I've cleared out all the guests today
[04:46.520 --> 04:49.520]  because I want to be able to cover all of this massive,
[04:49.520 --> 04:52.520]  incredibly important news and information,
[04:52.520 --> 04:56.520]  and I want to be able to take your phone calls as well.
[04:56.520 --> 05:01.520]  So thank you for joining us on this Monday, October 18th, 2021, Transmission.
[05:01.520 --> 05:04.520]  Okay, I'm first going to say this,
[05:04.520 --> 05:08.520]  and I don't say this to score a three-pointer
[05:08.520 --> 05:11.520]  or to score a slam dunk.
[05:11.520 --> 05:15.520]  I do this because this is why we're in so much trouble.
[05:15.520 --> 05:19.520]  I took off part of last week to spend time with my family
[05:19.520 --> 05:24.520]  and all of my children and took them to Florida to the beach.
[05:24.520 --> 05:28.520]  But I did some research and did some hosting as you heard you
[05:28.520 --> 05:30.520]  because you just can't drag me away, obviously.
[05:30.520 --> 05:32.520]  History is happening right in front of our faces,
[05:32.520 --> 05:34.520]  and I don't want to just be run over by it.
[05:34.520 --> 05:35.520]  I want to be a participant,
[05:35.520 --> 05:38.520]  and I want to have some control of my destiny.
[05:38.520 --> 05:44.520]  But Friday when I'm flying back, Friday morning,
[05:44.520 --> 05:50.520]  I actually see it on the CNN monitors at the airport.
[05:50.520 --> 05:55.520]  Blood testing under the new global COVID vaccine passport
[05:55.520 --> 06:00.520]  to ensure that you do not have COVID as the new test.
[06:00.520 --> 06:03.520]  And so I get on the plane.
[06:03.520 --> 06:06.520]  I'm on my phone, so-called phone,
[06:06.520 --> 06:08.520]  this digital tracking surveillance platform.
[06:08.520 --> 06:11.520]  They call a phone this Trojan Horse.
[06:11.520 --> 06:13.520]  And I noticed Paul Watson did an article about it
[06:13.520 --> 06:16.520]  and did a video about it, and he focused on the blood,
[06:16.520 --> 06:20.520]  how they're going to take your blood to travel.
[06:20.520 --> 06:24.520]  And then I noticed Saturday and Sunday
[06:24.520 --> 06:25.520]  no one ran headlines.
[06:25.520 --> 06:26.520]  Not even, and maybe I missed it,
[06:26.520 --> 06:28.520]  but Zero Hedge is one of the only groups
[06:28.520 --> 06:32.520]  that is sometimes a lot of the time even ahead of me.
[06:32.520 --> 06:34.520]  And no one picked it up.
[06:34.520 --> 06:36.520]  No one picked it up.
[06:36.520 --> 06:39.520]  Not Paul Watson at M4s or Summit.News.
[06:39.520 --> 06:40.520]  Not Zero Hedge.
[06:40.520 --> 06:42.520]  No one.
[06:42.520 --> 06:44.520]  And I thought, well, surely Climate Depot
[06:44.520 --> 06:46.520]  and Mark Moreno is going to be on this.
[06:46.520 --> 06:47.520]  Went over there, wasn't there.
[06:47.520 --> 06:48.520]  Maybe it's there now.
[06:48.520 --> 06:49.520]  And do you know what it is?
[06:49.520 --> 06:51.520]  Do you think them saying they're going to take your blood
[06:51.520 --> 06:54.520]  every time you travel with a new test owned and certified
[06:54.520 --> 06:56.520]  by the UN as the only one they can use
[06:56.520 --> 06:59.520]  that's now owned by Bill Gates and Soros
[06:59.520 --> 07:02.520]  that created the company a year ago and set it up?
[07:02.520 --> 07:04.520]  That's a whole scammin' of itself.
[07:04.520 --> 07:07.520]  But that's not the big story.
[07:07.520 --> 07:08.520]  And again, that's how they do it.
[07:08.520 --> 07:11.520]  CNN, ABC News, all of them ran
[07:11.520 --> 07:13.520]  with World Economic Forum on Veil's COVID Passport
[07:13.520 --> 07:21.520]  that uses blood test markers to determine vaccination status.
[07:21.520 --> 07:26.520]  Do you know what was actually in the Davos Group announcement?
[07:26.520 --> 07:28.520]  I've got, I've counted it.
[07:28.520 --> 07:30.520]  Ten giant announcements.
[07:30.520 --> 07:35.520]  And the blood is the least of them.
[07:35.520 --> 07:36.520]  Ten.
[07:36.520 --> 07:37.520]  I've got the transcript right here.
[07:37.520 --> 07:42.520]  I've got screenshots of their video.
[07:42.520 --> 07:43.520]  We're going to play the video again.
[07:43.520 --> 07:45.520]  And folks, I've got tons of news to cover.
[07:45.520 --> 07:47.520]  I'm not going to cover the same thing I covered last night,
[07:47.520 --> 07:49.520]  you know, because I don't have something to cover.
[07:49.520 --> 07:52.520]  It'd be like if Martians landed in Washington, D.C.
[07:52.520 --> 07:55.520]  I wouldn't be talking about the price of oil
[07:55.520 --> 07:58.520]  or I wouldn't be talking about how much coffee beans cost
[07:58.520 --> 08:01.520]  or how somebody got shot down at the liquor store.
[08:01.520 --> 08:04.520]  This is the big daddy.
[08:04.520 --> 08:07.520]  Let's put the live show headline up if we can
[08:07.520 --> 08:09.520]  because that's what this is.
[08:09.520 --> 08:16.520]  Mark of the Beast system officially announced.
[08:16.520 --> 08:17.520]  There it is.
[08:17.520 --> 08:19.520]  Mark of the Beast officially announced Davos Group
[08:19.520 --> 08:23.520]  rolls out vaccine passports to enforce global carbon taxes
[08:23.520 --> 08:25.520]  to restrict travel.
[08:25.520 --> 08:33.520]  Probably want to take the S off the end.
[08:33.520 --> 08:34.520]  Now think about that.
[08:34.520 --> 08:35.520]  Let's put it back up on screen.
[08:35.520 --> 08:37.520]  I wrote that headline two months before I went on air.
[08:37.520 --> 08:40.520]  That's my typo. I'm fixing live on air.
[08:40.520 --> 08:42.520]  Blowback.
[08:42.520 --> 08:45.520]  Fully vaccinated Colin Powell dies from complications
[08:45.520 --> 08:51.520]  of the Wuhan lab globalist bio-weapon COVID-19.
[08:51.520 --> 08:56.520]  Tune in now to this pivotal broadcast of the Alex Jones show
[08:56.520 --> 08:58.520]  because Alex Jones will lay out 200 ways
[08:58.520 --> 09:01.520]  to peacefully bring down the New World Order dictatorship.
[09:01.520 --> 09:02.520]  Share this link.
[09:02.520 --> 09:06.520]  And you know, I am, you know, a buddy of mine
[09:06.520 --> 09:09.520]  who has been involved in overthrowing governments
[09:09.520 --> 09:14.520]  and who has been involved in major very famous black ops
[09:14.520 --> 09:18.520]  and involved in the preparations to overthrow Kim Jong-un,
[09:18.520 --> 09:19.520]  things like that.
[09:19.520 --> 09:21.520]  He's a patriot.
[09:21.520 --> 09:24.520]  He didn't send me something secret this morning at 4 a.m.
[09:24.520 --> 09:28.520]  He sent me something that's public
[09:28.520 --> 09:30.520]  and that they've used in other countries
[09:30.520 --> 09:32.520]  to overthrow dictators.
[09:32.520 --> 09:35.520]  And so coming up in the third hour today,
[09:35.520 --> 09:38.520]  I'm going to read all 190 plus,
[09:38.520 --> 09:39.520]  but I've added a few to this
[09:39.520 --> 09:43.520]  because this list is not as modern as it could be.
[09:43.520 --> 09:50.520]  But it is 198 methods of nonviolent action.
[09:50.520 --> 09:53.520]  And this was developed by the Pentagon back when
[09:53.520 --> 09:56.520]  they actually followed the motto of free the oppressed,
[09:56.520 --> 09:59.520]  not oppress the people.
[09:59.520 --> 10:03.520]  So we're going to be going over the 198 methods
[10:03.520 --> 10:05.520]  because there's just a few more that I'll tell you
[10:05.520 --> 10:07.520]  are actually new methods of resistance.
[10:07.520 --> 10:08.520]  But we can open the phones up too
[10:08.520 --> 10:10.520]  for a whole show and talk about what those methods
[10:10.520 --> 10:13.520]  of resistance could be.
[10:13.520 --> 10:18.520]  So that's what we're going to be breaking down today.
[10:18.520 --> 10:19.520]  But at the bottom of the hour,
[10:19.520 --> 10:22.520]  because something this big needs to have some fanfare.
[10:22.520 --> 10:24.520]  I mean, auto-announce this seven o'clock at night
[10:24.520 --> 10:25.520]  when it's already dark
[10:25.520 --> 10:27.520]  and have spotlights above the building
[10:27.520 --> 10:28.520]  and, you know, dancing girls
[10:28.520 --> 10:31.520]  and 21 guns, salutes going off.
[10:31.520 --> 10:33.520]  I mean, maybe people go, whoa, this is important
[10:33.520 --> 10:35.520]  because if we don't spotlight this and say,
[10:35.520 --> 10:38.520]  hey, this is really big.
[10:38.520 --> 10:40.520]  Kind of like, is it important that a cockroach
[10:40.520 --> 10:41.520]  fell in your swimming pool
[10:41.520 --> 10:43.520]  and you're going to have to scoop it out later?
[10:43.520 --> 10:44.520]  No.
[10:44.520 --> 10:45.520]  But if I called you up as your neighbor and said,
[10:45.520 --> 10:48.520]  hey, Bob, four guys just broke in your house
[10:48.520 --> 10:50.520]  and they're carrying out your furniture
[10:50.520 --> 10:51.520]  and put it in the van,
[10:51.520 --> 10:52.520]  that's pretty important.
[10:52.520 --> 10:54.520]  Well, this is about a trillion times more important.
[10:54.520 --> 10:57.520]  I mean, this is hair on fire.
[10:57.520 --> 11:00.520]  This is really bad.
[11:00.520 --> 11:02.520]  They have openly announced
[11:02.520 --> 11:04.520]  the global government carbon tax
[11:04.520 --> 11:06.520]  to buy and sell and to travel.
[11:06.520 --> 11:08.520]  They say it will restrict your travel
[11:08.520 --> 11:10.520]  and they say it is under the
[11:10.520 --> 11:15.520]  UN approved worldwide vaccine passport
[11:15.520 --> 11:17.520]  and it's now being officially rolled out
[11:17.520 --> 11:23.520]  by the entire Fortune 500 as we speak.
[11:23.520 --> 11:24.520]  Now, you think about that.
[11:24.520 --> 11:26.520]  Now, they didn't just release this until Thursday,
[11:26.520 --> 11:28.520]  but they actually produced this
[11:28.520 --> 11:30.520]  and said it would be ready by September.
[11:30.520 --> 11:31.520]  So it's already rolling out
[11:31.520 --> 11:34.520]  and major retailers and major airlines have announced it.
[11:34.520 --> 11:38.520]  So, oh, you thought you were just getting the COVID pass,
[11:38.520 --> 11:39.520]  proving you'd have the shots.
[11:39.520 --> 11:41.520]  Oh, sorry.
[11:41.520 --> 11:42.520]  It's now a carbon pass.
[11:42.520 --> 11:44.520]  Now, folks, if you're a regular listener,
[11:44.520 --> 11:45.520]  you've heard me say this,
[11:45.520 --> 11:49.520]  probably in the last 21 months
[11:49.520 --> 11:51.520]  through the show, six, seven days a week.
[11:51.520 --> 11:52.520]  How many days?
[11:52.520 --> 11:53.520]  Almost 600 days.
[11:53.520 --> 11:54.520]  It's about 600 days.
[11:54.520 --> 11:56.520]  I've been on about seven days a week
[11:56.520 --> 11:58.520]  and I probably say it every hour.
[11:58.520 --> 12:00.520]  So I've said this thousands and thousands
[12:00.520 --> 12:02.520]  and thousands and thousands and thousands
[12:02.520 --> 12:03.520]  and thousands of times.
[12:03.520 --> 12:05.520]  And again, it's not because I have a Palantir,
[12:05.520 --> 12:06.520]  a crystal ball,
[12:06.520 --> 12:08.520]  I'm not talking to Sauron or Gandalf or the elves.
[12:08.520 --> 12:12.520]  I don't have the ring of power.
[12:12.520 --> 12:14.520]  I've got this.
[12:14.520 --> 12:17.520]  He wrote a damn book a year and a half ago
[12:17.520 --> 12:18.520]  about the whole plan,
[12:18.520 --> 12:19.520]  which was already in their plans.
[12:19.520 --> 12:20.520]  We already covered years before,
[12:20.520 --> 12:22.520]  but they officially say this
[12:22.520 --> 12:23.520]  and they're doing this to make you poor,
[12:23.520 --> 12:25.520]  to control you and make you non-essential
[12:25.520 --> 12:27.520]  and they're not going to let you travel or live
[12:27.520 --> 12:29.520]  and food's going to cost three times more
[12:29.520 --> 12:30.520]  and fuel's going to cost double
[12:30.520 --> 12:31.520]  and that's just the beginning.
[12:31.520 --> 12:32.520]  So everything collapses
[12:32.520 --> 12:34.520]  and I have them officially announcing it
[12:34.520 --> 12:38.520]  in the news today.
[12:38.520 --> 12:40.520]  But I'm going to show you where they say it
[12:40.520 --> 12:42.520]  and go over each piece of it
[12:42.520 --> 12:43.520]  and then the incredible lies.
[12:43.520 --> 12:45.520]  It says nothing tracks you
[12:45.520 --> 12:47.520]  and you have no privacy violations
[12:47.520 --> 12:49.520]  and no one has your data.
[12:49.520 --> 12:51.520]  When we take your blood,
[12:51.520 --> 12:52.520]  when we scan it,
[12:52.520 --> 12:53.520]  when it's on a QR code
[12:53.520 --> 12:55.520]  in a global UN database
[12:55.520 --> 12:57.520]  and we're going to add up your carbon credits
[12:57.520 --> 12:58.520]  and decide where you can go
[12:58.520 --> 13:00.520]  and what you can do if we let you
[13:00.520 --> 13:02.520]  and that doesn't track you.
[13:02.520 --> 13:03.520]  That's like saying again,
[13:03.520 --> 13:05.520]  if you took somebody and chopped their head off
[13:05.520 --> 13:07.520]  with a guillotine saying,
[13:07.520 --> 13:10.520]  nobody laid a scratch on that person's neck
[13:10.520 --> 13:12.520]  or have the Dallas Cowboys right on the field
[13:12.520 --> 13:14.520]  with their powder baby blue helmets
[13:14.520 --> 13:16.520]  and the navy blue star
[13:16.520 --> 13:19.520]  and saying the Dallas Cowboys aren't in Dallas
[13:19.520 --> 13:21.520]  and don't have navy blue stars.
[13:21.520 --> 13:23.520]  I mean, it is like saying,
[13:23.520 --> 13:24.520]  red lights aren't red,
[13:24.520 --> 13:25.520]  green lights aren't green.
[13:25.520 --> 13:29.520]  It is just, it's fabulous gaslighting.
[13:29.520 --> 13:31.520]  And you think, well, that's dumb.
[13:31.520 --> 13:32.520]  That'll discredit them.
[13:32.520 --> 13:33.520]  They don't care.
[13:33.520 --> 13:35.520]  They're meant to just get you used to so many lies
[13:35.520 --> 13:37.520]  and yeah, because if the pedophiles came to your school
[13:37.520 --> 13:38.520]  and announced and your five-year-old bounced
[13:38.520 --> 13:40.520]  on their erection through the pants, yeah, yeah.
[13:40.520 --> 13:42.520]  And the mother takes the children
[13:42.520 --> 13:44.520]  and lay them on the genitals of the man
[13:44.520 --> 13:45.520]  while he humps them on TV.
[13:45.520 --> 13:47.520]  It's all pissing on you.
[13:47.520 --> 13:48.520]  It's all dominating you.
[13:48.520 --> 13:50.520]  But hey, these guys will face God.
[13:50.520 --> 13:52.520]  You look at the blowback of Colin Powell
[13:52.520 --> 13:54.520]  and you know Colin Powell.
[13:54.520 --> 13:55.520]  I feel sorry for him,
[13:55.520 --> 13:57.520]  but I don't like to judge the dead,
[13:57.520 --> 13:58.520]  but man, I tell you,
[13:58.520 --> 14:00.520]  he never repented to what he did
[14:00.520 --> 14:02.520]  and I tell you, he's burning in hell right now.
[14:02.520 --> 14:04.520]  Well, they're right back. Stay with us.
[14:07.520 --> 14:09.520]  If you're concerned about the power grid
[14:09.520 --> 14:11.520]  and want to generate your own supply
[14:11.520 --> 14:12.520]  of off-grid electricity,
[14:12.520 --> 14:14.520]  this will be the most important message
[14:14.520 --> 14:16.520]  you'll hear this year.
[14:16.520 --> 14:17.520]  Here's why.
[14:17.520 --> 14:19.520]  We now have a small number of solar generators
[14:19.520 --> 14:20.520]  back in stock.
[14:20.520 --> 14:22.520]  These emergency backup systems
[14:22.520 --> 14:24.520]  provide life-saving backup power
[14:24.520 --> 14:25.520]  when you need it most.
[14:25.520 --> 14:27.520]  And unlike gas generators,
[14:27.520 --> 14:29.520]  solar generators run quietly,
[14:29.520 --> 14:30.520]  emit no dangerous fumes,
[14:30.520 --> 14:32.520]  and produce an endless supply
[14:32.520 --> 14:34.520]  of free electricity from the sun.
[14:34.520 --> 14:36.520]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather,
[14:36.520 --> 14:37.520]  power grid issues,
[14:37.520 --> 14:39.520]  or just getting off the grid,
[14:39.520 --> 14:41.520]  you'll never have to suffer through
[14:41.520 --> 14:43.520]  painful power outages again.
[14:43.520 --> 14:45.520]  Even better, all this week,
[14:45.520 --> 14:47.520]  radio listeners get over $700
[14:47.520 --> 14:49.520]  in free off-the-grid bonuses, too.
[14:49.520 --> 14:51.520]  Go to mysolarbackup.com
[14:51.520 --> 14:53.520]  to learn more and check availability.
[14:53.520 --> 14:55.520]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[14:55.520 --> 14:57.520]  Look for the free report, crisis cooling,
[14:57.520 --> 14:59.520]  how to make absolutely sure
[14:59.520 --> 15:01.520]  your meat, milk, and medicines
[15:01.520 --> 15:03.520]  stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[15:03.520 --> 15:06.520]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[15:06.520 --> 15:07.520]  Hey, everybody.
[15:07.520 --> 15:10.520]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans
[15:10.520 --> 15:12.520]  as a storable survival food,
[15:12.520 --> 15:13.520]  I've got great news.
[15:13.520 --> 15:15.520]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news
[15:15.520 --> 15:16.520]  you've heard in a while.
[15:16.520 --> 15:17.520]  Here's the thing.
[15:17.520 --> 15:19.520]  We've just received a fresh batch
[15:19.520 --> 15:21.520]  of gourmet heirloom beans,
[15:21.520 --> 15:22.520]  survival soup beans.
[15:22.520 --> 15:24.520]  These beans are gorgeous,
[15:24.520 --> 15:25.520]  highly nutritious,
[15:25.520 --> 15:26.520]  and, above all,
[15:26.520 --> 15:28.520]  with no hesitation whatsoever,
[15:28.520 --> 15:30.520]  the best-tasting beans in the entire world.
[15:30.520 --> 15:31.520]  The best part?
[15:31.520 --> 15:34.520]  We've dropped the price by 33% this week
[15:34.520 --> 15:36.520]  for listeners who know
[15:36.520 --> 15:38.520]  higher food prices are coming
[15:38.520 --> 15:39.520]  and want an inflation hedge
[15:39.520 --> 15:41.520]  you can actually eat if you want to.
[15:41.520 --> 15:42.520]  It gets even better.
[15:42.520 --> 15:43.520]  With your permission
[15:43.520 --> 15:45.520]  and with a high regard for your health
[15:45.520 --> 15:46.520]  and well-being,
[15:46.520 --> 15:48.520]  I also want to send you two pounds
[15:48.520 --> 15:49.520]  of what we think
[15:49.520 --> 15:51.520]  is the single most underrated
[15:51.520 --> 15:53.520]  superfood in the world, period.
[15:53.520 --> 15:55.520]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com
[15:55.520 --> 15:57.520]  at soupbeansurvival.com
[15:57.520 --> 15:59.520]  and discover the real reason
[15:59.520 --> 16:01.520]  we're giving this unusual superfood away
[16:01.520 --> 16:03.520]  at soupbeansurvival.com
[16:03.520 --> 16:06.520]  at soupbeansurvival.com.
[16:08.520 --> 16:11.520]  At the time of cutting this announcement,
[16:11.520 --> 16:14.520]  it is the morning of Sunday,
[16:14.520 --> 16:16.520]  October 17th,
[16:16.520 --> 16:18.520]  and that means
[16:18.520 --> 16:21.520]  there is less than 48 hours left
[16:21.520 --> 16:24.520]  to take advantage of our emergency
[16:24.520 --> 16:26.520]  mega-blowout sale
[16:26.520 --> 16:29.520]  that is tied directly to these supply chain breakdowns
[16:29.520 --> 16:31.520]  happening across the world by design
[16:31.520 --> 16:33.520]  for the Great Reset
[16:33.520 --> 16:35.520]  as the central banks attempt to bankrupt
[16:35.520 --> 16:37.520]  the mainline economy to consolidate it
[16:37.520 --> 16:40.520]  then to move in with the quadrillions
[16:40.520 --> 16:42.520]  of fake currency they have
[16:42.520 --> 16:44.520]  to buy up what's left of the infrastructure
[16:44.520 --> 16:46.520]  that they don't already control.
[16:46.520 --> 16:48.520]  This is economic warfare
[16:48.520 --> 16:50.520]  and so InfoWars is under attack
[16:50.520 --> 16:52.520]  like every other pro-American
[16:52.520 --> 16:54.520]  independent organization and we need funding.
[16:54.520 --> 16:56.520]  And so, despite the fact we're running out
[16:56.520 --> 16:58.520]  of a lot of our best selling products,
[16:58.520 --> 17:00.520]  I'm still offering them at huge sale prices
[17:00.520 --> 17:02.520]  because I need to move them out to get the capital in.
[17:02.520 --> 17:04.520]  So take advantage of this sale,
[17:04.520 --> 17:06.520]  it's only running until Monday night
[17:06.520 --> 17:13.520]  at InfoWarsStore.com
[17:36.520 --> 17:38.520]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates,
[17:38.520 --> 17:41.520]  you didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller,
[17:41.520 --> 17:43.520]  you didn't start a fight with the UN,
[17:43.520 --> 17:46.520]  they started a fight with you.
[17:46.520 --> 17:48.520]  And they're not gonna back down
[17:48.520 --> 17:50.520]  and they're not gonna go away
[17:50.520 --> 17:53.520]  and they're not going to ever stop their attacks
[17:53.520 --> 17:55.520]  until they have the fear of God put into them.
[17:55.520 --> 17:57.520]  But the average person still doesn't even know
[17:57.520 --> 17:59.520]  about the New World Order
[17:59.520 --> 18:01.520]  or about globalism or about corporate fascism
[18:01.520 --> 18:04.520]  and it's not until people understand that
[18:04.520 --> 18:06.520]  and that we're under attack that we have any chance
[18:06.520 --> 18:35.520]  of beating these people.
[18:37.520 --> 18:39.520]  You found it.
[18:39.520 --> 18:42.520]  The front lines of the fight for the human future
[18:42.520 --> 18:46.520]  and the war for the third dimension and beyond.
[18:46.520 --> 18:48.520]  For the tenth dimension,
[18:48.520 --> 18:53.520]  beyond infinity.
[18:53.520 --> 18:58.520]  Alright, here we are.
[18:58.520 --> 19:03.520]  Colin Powell
[19:03.520 --> 19:08.520]  is an absolutely wicked person
[19:08.520 --> 19:11.520]  who when they couldn't sell the Iraq war
[19:11.520 --> 19:13.520]  and the New York Times and others
[19:13.520 --> 19:15.520]  were knowingly manufacturing yellow cake
[19:15.520 --> 19:18.520]  from Nigeria and aluminum tubes
[19:18.520 --> 19:21.520]  and nuclear weapons hidden under rose bushes
[19:21.520 --> 19:24.520]  in southern Baghdad.
[19:24.520 --> 19:27.520]  They wanted to go destabilize that country further
[19:27.520 --> 19:29.520]  and be able to take it over.
[19:29.520 --> 19:31.520]  They had already set up Saddam,
[19:31.520 --> 19:33.520]  in 1990, they told him to invade,
[19:33.520 --> 19:37.520]  they told him to go after Iran and the Iran-Iraq war.
[19:37.520 --> 19:39.520]  He was put in by the CIA
[19:39.520 --> 19:42.520]  and they then set him up to build their New World Order
[19:42.520 --> 19:44.520]  to have the image of the UN and all these countries
[19:44.520 --> 19:47.520]  ganged up going in and invading a country.
[19:47.520 --> 19:48.520]  Then they put sanctions on him
[19:48.520 --> 19:50.520]  that killed over two million Iraqis.
[19:50.520 --> 19:55.520]  And then along comes 2003
[19:55.520 --> 19:57.520]  and instead of going after the Taliban
[19:57.520 --> 19:59.520]  or al-Qaeda or the globalist groups
[19:59.520 --> 20:01.520]  and the Kar-Law group and the Bushes
[20:01.520 --> 20:03.520]  that funded them and protected them,
[20:03.520 --> 20:07.520]  instead the United States went after Iraq again
[20:07.520 --> 20:09.520]  and our military was put into there.
[20:09.520 --> 20:11.520]  So they could make trillions and trillions of dollars
[20:11.520 --> 20:13.520]  with five trillion dollars up the Iraq war,
[20:13.520 --> 20:15.520]  two and a half trillion off the Afghanistan war
[20:15.520 --> 20:19.520]  designed for the big defense contractor companies
[20:19.520 --> 20:21.520]  to steal trillions of dollars
[20:21.520 --> 20:23.520]  and to base our military.
[20:23.520 --> 20:27.520]  He got up there famously with the anthrax vile
[20:27.520 --> 20:29.520]  and said, this is being made in these mobile labs
[20:29.520 --> 20:32.520]  and they showed a supposed photo
[20:32.520 --> 20:33.520]  of one of the mobile trucks
[20:33.520 --> 20:35.520]  that they knew from James Weapons Quarterly
[20:35.520 --> 20:40.520]  was a very popular British truck made for 50 years
[20:40.520 --> 20:42.520]  that Saddam had bought hundreds of
[20:42.520 --> 20:45.520]  for the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s
[20:45.520 --> 20:48.520]  that put up hydrogen balloons
[20:48.520 --> 20:52.520]  at 10,000 feet on a cable with cameras on them
[20:52.520 --> 20:54.520]  so you could direct artillery.
[20:54.520 --> 20:56.520]  In fact, it turned out U.S. taxpayer money
[20:56.520 --> 21:02.520]  paid and the CIA advised Saddam to buy those vehicles.
[21:02.520 --> 21:06.520]  So the CIA advised the U.S. taxpayer
[21:06.520 --> 21:10.520]  paid to give money to Saddam for him
[21:10.520 --> 21:13.520]  to then buy those very trucks
[21:13.520 --> 21:17.520]  that they knew the name, the model, everything.
[21:17.520 --> 21:19.520]  Like you see an Abrams tank,
[21:19.520 --> 21:21.520]  was that an A-1, whatever,
[21:21.520 --> 21:24.520]  what variant of the B-2 bomber is that
[21:24.520 --> 21:26.520]  or what type of aircraft carrier is that,
[21:26.520 --> 21:27.520]  what class is that?
[21:27.520 --> 21:30.520]  They know in five seconds a weapons expert
[21:30.520 --> 21:32.520]  and they got there and said, here's the anthrax
[21:32.520 --> 21:36.520]  and they made it in these trucks
[21:36.520 --> 21:37.520]  and then they went in there
[21:37.520 --> 21:38.520]  and blew the whole country up again
[21:38.520 --> 21:39.520]  and you know the rest is history,
[21:39.520 --> 21:41.520]  another million starved to death after that.
[21:41.520 --> 21:43.520]  That's what they did to an industrialized country.
[21:43.520 --> 21:44.520]  Now they're starving us to death.
[21:44.520 --> 21:45.520]  Now they're shutting down our countries.
[21:45.520 --> 21:48.520]  Now they're putting us under the same level of siege
[21:48.520 --> 21:51.520]  so what's good for the goose is good for the gander.
[21:51.520 --> 21:52.520]  We reap what we sow,
[21:52.520 --> 21:54.520]  that's why we have to repent before this comes down on us,
[21:54.520 --> 21:55.520]  but it already is.
[21:55.520 --> 21:57.520]  The same murderers that wanted to de-populate Iraq
[21:57.520 --> 21:59.520]  are going to do it to us.
[21:59.520 --> 22:01.520]  They're doing it to Africa, Latin America.
[22:01.520 --> 22:04.520]  So isn't it karmic or you reap what you sow
[22:04.520 --> 22:07.520]  that he held up a fake bio-weapon,
[22:07.520 --> 22:10.520]  turned out it wasn't even anthrax in the vial,
[22:10.520 --> 22:13.520]  be illegally walking around with it for anybody,
[22:13.520 --> 22:16.520]  unless you're in a level four weapons lab at Fort Detrick,
[22:16.520 --> 22:18.520]  he holds up the so-called vial of anthrax
[22:18.520 --> 22:20.520]  and they have to kill everybody in the building
[22:20.520 --> 22:22.520]  if they were to aerosolize it properly.
[22:22.520 --> 22:25.520]  And he used the lie of a biological weapon
[22:25.520 --> 22:30.520]  to launch a war that killed another million people total.
[22:30.520 --> 22:35.520]  And isn't it fitting that he died from a biological weapon?
[22:35.520 --> 22:39.520]  Isn't it fitting that Fauci and Gates and Peter Dazic
[22:39.520 --> 22:41.520]  cooked it up and ran the Wuhan lab
[22:41.520 --> 22:43.520]  and we have all the documents and all the admissions,
[22:43.520 --> 22:45.520]  how they made COVID-19, how they told the Pentagon
[22:45.520 --> 22:47.520]  they were going to release it on the Chinese people,
[22:47.520 --> 22:49.520]  Pentagon said that'll start a war, do not do that.
[22:49.520 --> 22:52.520]  That was only five years ago.
[22:52.520 --> 22:55.520]  And they cooked it up and finally did release it
[22:55.520 --> 22:57.520]  so they had plausible deniability to say,
[22:57.520 --> 23:01.520]  oh, it came from a wet market, a wild animal market,
[23:01.520 --> 23:04.520]  or it accidentally got out, no, they released it on purpose
[23:04.520 --> 23:06.520]  and it's an operation lockstep.
[23:06.520 --> 23:13.520]  And then that very weapon killed the globalist puppet
[23:13.520 --> 23:15.520]  who helped serve the same system
[23:15.520 --> 23:17.520]  and lied about biological weapons himself.
[23:17.520 --> 23:19.520]  That is extremely fitting.
[23:19.520 --> 23:20.520]  Am I happy he's dead?
[23:20.520 --> 23:22.520]  No, but I'm happy he can't commit more evil
[23:22.520 --> 23:24.520]  in his lifetime against humanity
[23:24.520 --> 23:28.520]  because he is the accomplice to mass murder and mass death
[23:28.520 --> 23:30.520]  and is a war criminal of biblical proportions
[23:30.520 --> 23:34.520]  along with Henry Kissinger and the rest of them.
[23:34.520 --> 23:36.520]  Bill Clinton's fighting for his life right now
[23:36.520 --> 23:39.520]  in a hospital with flesh eating bacteria.
[23:39.520 --> 23:43.520]  They will all face their makers.
[23:43.520 --> 23:45.520]  Hillary looked real scared walking out of there.
[23:45.520 --> 23:47.520]  As long as she cares about Bill
[23:47.520 --> 23:49.520]  because she's got the fires of hell
[23:49.520 --> 23:52.520]  lapping at her pedophile defending ass,
[23:52.520 --> 24:01.520]  her warmongering America hating God hating ass.
[24:01.520 --> 24:04.520]  But here's the bigger story.
[24:04.520 --> 24:06.520]  He took the Pfizer shot.
[24:06.520 --> 24:07.520]  That's on the news.
[24:07.520 --> 24:10.520]  He bragged about it.
[24:10.520 --> 24:12.520]  And just like the John Hopkins statistics
[24:12.520 --> 24:14.520]  and the UK statistics show,
[24:14.520 --> 24:16.520]  you're twice as likely to die of COVID
[24:16.520 --> 24:18.520]  if you take any of those vaccines that aren't vaccines
[24:18.520 --> 24:21.520]  and you're way more likely to end up in the hospital or dead
[24:21.520 --> 24:23.520]  and it's the same in every major country in the world
[24:23.520 --> 24:25.520]  that has taken those.
[24:25.520 --> 24:28.520]  But countries that haven't taken them, no problems.
[24:28.520 --> 24:31.520]  It's over for them.
[24:31.520 --> 24:34.520]  So a casualty of his own evil.
[24:34.520 --> 24:37.520]  Those that live by the biological weapons sword
[24:37.520 --> 24:41.520]  die by the biological weapons sword.
[24:41.520 --> 24:45.520]  Here is him setting the stage to go back
[24:45.520 --> 24:50.520]  and kill millions more in Iraq.
[24:50.520 --> 24:52.520]  You will recall that it took unscombed
[24:52.520 --> 24:56.520]  for long and frustrating years to pry,
[24:56.520 --> 24:59.520]  to pry and admission out of Iraq
[24:59.520 --> 25:01.520]  that it had biological weapons.
[25:01.520 --> 25:05.520]  Second, when Iraq finally admitted
[25:05.520 --> 25:07.520]  having these weapons in 1995,
[25:07.520 --> 25:10.520]  the quantities were vast.
[25:10.520 --> 25:13.520]  Less than a teaspoon of dry anthrax.
[25:13.520 --> 25:15.520]  A little bit about this amount.
[25:15.520 --> 25:17.520]  This is just about the amount of a teaspoon.
[25:17.520 --> 25:20.520]  Less than a teaspoon full of dry anthrax
[25:20.520 --> 25:23.520]  in an envelope shut down the United States Senate
[25:23.520 --> 25:26.520]  in the fall of 2001.
[25:26.520 --> 25:29.520]  This forced several hundred people
[25:29.520 --> 25:31.520]  to undergo emergency medical treatment
[25:31.520 --> 25:34.520]  and killed two postal workers
[25:34.520 --> 25:37.520]  just from an amount, just about this quantity
[25:37.520 --> 25:39.520]  that was inside of an envelope.
[25:39.520 --> 25:44.520]  Iraq declared 8,500 liters of anthrax.
[25:44.520 --> 25:47.520]  But unscombed estimates that Saddam Hussein
[25:47.520 --> 25:51.520]  could have produced 25,000 liters.
[25:51.520 --> 25:53.520]  If concentrated into this dry form,
[25:53.520 --> 25:56.520]  this amount would be enough to fill
[25:56.520 --> 26:01.520]  tens upon tens upon tens of thousands of teaspoons.
[26:01.520 --> 26:05.520]  And Saddam Hussein has not verifiably accounted
[26:05.520 --> 26:10.520]  for even one teaspoon full of this deadly material.
[26:10.520 --> 26:13.520]  And that is my third point, and it is key.
[26:13.520 --> 26:15.520]  The Iraqis have...
[26:15.520 --> 26:18.520]  And he goes on to show the trucks and tell all the lies.
[26:18.520 --> 26:21.520]  Well, he got killed by a real bio-weapon.
[26:21.520 --> 26:24.520]  It wasn't Saddam Hussein cooking up anthrax.
[26:24.520 --> 26:26.520]  No, ladies and gentlemen,
[26:26.520 --> 26:30.520]  it was the people in charge of minions
[26:30.520 --> 26:33.520]  like Colin Powell that were cooking up COVID-19
[26:33.520 --> 26:35.520]  that they then released on the world
[26:35.520 --> 26:37.520]  to kill our old people
[26:37.520 --> 26:39.520]  and to kill people that had pre-existing conditions
[26:39.520 --> 26:40.520]  to depopulate.
[26:40.520 --> 26:42.520]  And now the vaccine itself is not a vaccine.
[26:42.520 --> 26:44.520]  It's killing even more people than that,
[26:44.520 --> 26:47.520]  and it's all confirmed, and it's all on record.
[26:47.520 --> 26:50.520]  So, they say you're not speaking ill of the dead,
[26:50.520 --> 26:52.520]  but I think when you're talking about the likes of
[26:52.520 --> 26:55.520]  Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler or Colin Powell
[26:55.520 --> 26:57.520]  or Bill Clinton, I'll just say this.
[26:57.520 --> 27:00.520]  Thanks to Jesus. Vengeance is yours.
[27:00.520 --> 27:03.520]  Colin Powell is now where he wanted to be.
[27:03.520 --> 27:32.520]  Away from God. You can bet your bottom dollar.
[27:34.520 --> 27:38.520]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver,
[27:38.520 --> 27:40.520]  but you can check out what I've discovered
[27:40.520 --> 27:42.520]  at StrongerDefense.com.
[27:42.520 --> 27:44.520]  No cures or treatments there.

[27:47.520 --> 27:49.520]  and a breakthrough immune support product
[27:49.520 --> 27:52.520]  based on that research called Immune10x.

[27:58.520 --> 28:00.520]  without paying anything today.

[28:08.520 --> 28:11.520]  At the time of cutting this announcement,
[28:11.520 --> 28:16.520]  it is the morning of Sunday, October 17th.
[28:16.520 --> 28:21.520]  And that means there is less than 48 hours left
[28:21.520 --> 28:26.520]  to take advantage of our emergency mega blowout sale
[28:26.520 --> 28:29.520]  that is tied directly to these supply chain breakdowns
[28:29.520 --> 28:31.520]  happening across the world by design
[28:31.520 --> 28:33.520]  for the Great Reset.
[28:33.520 --> 28:35.520]  As the central banks attempt to bankrupt
[28:35.520 --> 28:37.520]  the mainline economy to consolidate it
[28:37.520 --> 28:40.520]  and to move in with the quadrillions
[28:40.520 --> 28:42.520]  of fake currency they have to buy up
[28:42.520 --> 28:43.520]  what's left of the infrastructure
[28:43.520 --> 28:45.520]  that they don't already control.
[28:45.520 --> 28:47.520]  This is economic warfare.
[28:47.520 --> 28:49.520]  And so, InfoWars is under attack
[28:49.520 --> 28:52.520]  like every other pro-American independent organization,
[28:52.520 --> 28:53.520]  and we need funding.
[28:53.520 --> 28:55.520]  And so, despite the fact that we're running out
[28:55.520 --> 28:57.520]  of a lot of our best selling products,
[28:57.520 --> 28:59.520]  I'm still offering them at huge sale prices
[28:59.520 --> 29:02.520]  because I need to move them out and get the capital in.
[29:02.520 --> 29:03.520]  So take advantage of this sale.
[29:03.520 --> 29:05.520]  It's only running until Monday night
[29:05.520 --> 29:09.520]  at InfoWarsStore.com.
[29:09.520 --> 29:11.520]  Could you imagine a year ago
[29:11.520 --> 29:14.520]  walking into a bank with your face covered?
[29:14.520 --> 29:16.520]  Could you imagine you've been going into the grocery store?
[29:16.520 --> 29:18.520]  Do you think they would let you in?
[29:18.520 --> 29:20.520]  Do you think they would be following you in the aisles
[29:20.520 --> 29:22.520]  to make sure that you weren't going to be shoplifting?
[29:22.520 --> 29:27.520]  Could you imagine going up to a gas station
[29:27.520 --> 29:28.520]  and going inside the little mini-mart
[29:28.520 --> 29:31.520]  to pay for your gas with a bandana on?
[29:31.520 --> 29:32.520]  How far do you think that would get you?
[29:32.520 --> 29:35.520]  Could you imagine as a teacher showing up to school
[29:35.520 --> 29:39.520]  with a shield that looks like a space alien?
[29:39.520 --> 29:42.520]  Those things are offensive to us
[29:42.520 --> 29:46.520]  because it interferes with normal human interaction.
[29:46.520 --> 29:48.520]  The globalists are running a psychological war
[29:48.520 --> 29:49.520]  for operational humanity,
[29:49.520 --> 29:53.520]  only waking up to the great reset in its tyranny will save us.
[29:53.520 --> 29:55.520]  And the mask is the sign of slavery.
[29:55.520 --> 29:57.520]  We must inform the public that it's a fraud
[29:57.520 --> 29:58.520]  and that it's dangerous
[29:58.520 --> 30:00.520]  and that it causes major medical issues
[30:00.520 --> 30:01.520]  and it's dehumanizing.
[30:01.520 --> 30:03.520]  And the film COVID Land does that.
[30:03.520 --> 30:06.520]  Secure your copy now at covidland.com
[30:06.520 --> 30:10.520]  and get a free copy of the in-game with your purchase.
[30:10.520 --> 30:12.520]  I want to explain something
[30:12.520 --> 30:14.520]  that is absolutely heat understanding our world.
[30:14.520 --> 30:17.520]  It's very, very simple, but the most people don't know.
[30:17.520 --> 30:21.520]  The privately owned central banks of the world
[30:21.520 --> 30:25.520]  are artificially creating thousands of trillions of dollars
[30:25.520 --> 30:27.520]  and other major currencies
[30:27.520 --> 30:30.520]  and using them to buy up infrastructure,
[30:30.520 --> 30:33.520]  intellectual property, energy.
[30:33.520 --> 30:36.520]  They're using it to buy people, to buy influence.
[30:36.520 --> 30:39.520]  And in the past, they created thousands of trillions
[30:39.520 --> 30:42.520]  so that they could leverage that, manipulate markets
[30:42.520 --> 30:44.520]  but they never allowed that money
[30:44.520 --> 30:46.520]  to get into the general circulation
[30:46.520 --> 30:48.520]  that would cause massive inflation.
[30:48.520 --> 30:50.520]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it
[30:50.520 --> 30:52.520]  and are flooding every sector of the world economy,
[30:52.520 --> 30:54.520]  buying up everything.
[30:54.520 --> 30:56.520]  Not to have the companies operate
[30:56.520 --> 30:58.520]  but to actually shut them down
[30:58.520 --> 31:00.520]  and force a collapse of civilization.
[31:00.520 --> 31:02.520]  Making the companies they do fund
[31:02.520 --> 31:04.520]  are the only things left standing.
[31:04.520 --> 31:05.520]  This is the great reset.
[31:05.520 --> 31:06.520]  This is what's happening now.
[31:06.520 --> 31:07.520]  We're warning everyone.
[31:07.520 --> 31:17.520]  It's the only way to stop it.
[31:38.520 --> 31:43.520]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[31:43.520 --> 31:45.520]  All right, I have a few more comments
[31:45.520 --> 31:49.520]  about the globalists that died early this morning
[31:49.520 --> 31:54.520]  of complications, they tell us, from COVID-19.
[31:54.520 --> 31:56.520]  Who knows if that's even true?
[31:56.520 --> 31:58.520]  They lie so much, but they want to scare you
[31:58.520 --> 31:59.520]  and say, see, it's real.
[31:59.520 --> 32:00.520]  You better go out and get your shot.
[32:00.520 --> 32:02.520]  They're actually on the news saying,
[32:02.520 --> 32:03.520]  you better get your shot.
[32:03.520 --> 32:05.520]  Just type it in.
[32:05.520 --> 32:09.520]  Americans encouraged to take their COVID vaccine.
[32:09.520 --> 32:12.520]  Holdouts encouraged after Colin Powell died.
[32:12.520 --> 32:15.520]  And then they don't point out he was quotefully vaccinated.
[32:15.520 --> 32:16.520]  You can pull up the articles,
[32:16.520 --> 32:19.520]  him out there pushing it six months ago.
[32:19.520 --> 32:22.520]  Just like so many other prominent people
[32:22.520 --> 32:26.520]  take the shot and end up dead.
[32:26.520 --> 32:29.520]  Don't think there'll be a VAERS report about him, though.
[32:29.520 --> 32:31.520]  So he died of COVID, supposedly,
[32:31.520 --> 32:32.520]  but it didn't protect him.
[32:32.520 --> 32:33.520]  And here are the headlines.
[32:33.520 --> 32:35.520]  Colin Powell's death.
[32:35.520 --> 32:37.520]  Former Secretary of State dies from COVID complications
[32:37.520 --> 32:39.520]  at age 84.
[32:39.520 --> 32:43.520]  And you don't see anywhere in ABC, NBC,
[32:43.520 --> 32:46.520]  the London Independent, the BBC, the New York Times.
[32:46.520 --> 32:48.520]  Nowhere do they say he was fully vaccinated.
[32:48.520 --> 32:49.520]  If you can pull that up and look it up,
[32:49.520 --> 32:52.520]  we have links to it on infowars.com.
[32:52.520 --> 32:53.520]  CBS News.
[32:53.520 --> 32:55.520]  Colin Powell, first Black Secretary of State,
[32:55.520 --> 32:58.520]  dies at 84 from complications of COVID-19.
[32:58.520 --> 33:00.520]  Nowhere does it say he was fully vaccinated.
[33:00.520 --> 33:02.520]  Former Secretary of State Colin Powell dies
[33:02.520 --> 33:03.520]  from COVID complications.
[33:03.520 --> 33:07.520]  NBC News.
[33:07.520 --> 33:09.520]  And there it is, fully vaccinated.
[33:09.520 --> 33:11.520]  Colin Powell dies from COVID complications.
[33:11.520 --> 33:14.520]  And we've got links to where he bragged
[33:14.520 --> 33:17.520]  about being fully injected in the article.
[33:17.520 --> 33:18.520]  Is it that the news?
[33:18.520 --> 33:19.520]  Fully vaccinated?
[33:19.520 --> 33:21.520]  Gateway Punnett got it right.
[33:21.520 --> 33:23.520]  Colin Powell dies at 84 from COVID complications.
[33:23.520 --> 33:27.520]  He was fully vaccinated.
[33:27.520 --> 33:29.520]  Isn't that interesting?
[33:29.520 --> 33:31.520]  Very, very interesting.
[33:31.520 --> 33:35.520]  Okay, I'm going to hit the big news now.
[33:35.520 --> 33:38.520]  The supermassive news, and I want to put on screen
[33:38.520 --> 33:42.520]  a Kit Daniels article that he wrote today about it.
[33:42.520 --> 33:45.520]  It's very, very important to put that headline up on screen.
[33:45.520 --> 33:50.520]  There it is.
[33:50.520 --> 33:52.520]  It's such a big deal.
[33:52.520 --> 33:54.520]  And again, I don't want, you see,
[33:54.520 --> 33:57.520]  when I see Joe Rogan really awake fighting the New World Order now
[33:57.520 --> 34:00.520]  or Tucker Carlson really awake fighting it,
[34:00.520 --> 34:04.520]  I don't go, hey, those guys have horned in on my territory
[34:04.520 --> 34:07.520]  or, oh man, they're getting so popular telling the truth.
[34:07.520 --> 34:09.520]  I think, thank God we've come this far
[34:09.520 --> 34:11.520]  that the most popular people in the country
[34:11.520 --> 34:13.520]  and in the world really, I mean,
[34:13.520 --> 34:15.520]  Tucker's loved around the world, so has Joe,
[34:15.520 --> 34:18.520]  that they both say, man, you were right.
[34:18.520 --> 34:19.520]  You helped wake me up.
[34:19.520 --> 34:21.520]  Thank you.
[34:21.520 --> 34:23.520]  I mean, the left makes a big deal about it.
[34:23.520 --> 34:24.520]  They get so jealous of it.
[34:24.520 --> 34:27.520]  They have CNN pieces and MSNBC pieces
[34:27.520 --> 34:28.520]  and media matters pieces.
[34:28.520 --> 34:30.520]  We had a new one a few days ago saying it's just horrible
[34:30.520 --> 34:32.520]  that Joe Rogan talks to Alex Jones and their friends.
[34:32.520 --> 34:35.520]  It's horrible that Tucker Carlson says nice things about Alex Jones.
[34:35.520 --> 34:37.520]  We've got to boycott him or take him off the air
[34:37.520 --> 34:41.520]  because he's not allowed to because if I get defended
[34:41.520 --> 34:44.520]  as the main vanguard fighting this,
[34:44.520 --> 34:46.520]  well, then they can't demonize everybody else that doesn't
[34:46.520 --> 34:49.520]  and scare people away from the truth.
[34:49.520 --> 34:51.520]  They're going to fail in that fear
[34:51.520 --> 34:54.520]  because we should celebrate people that tell the truth.
[34:54.520 --> 34:58.520]  So I'm very, very excited to see how awake Rogan is,
[34:58.520 --> 35:05.520]  how hyper-awake Tucker is because I see Tucker
[35:05.520 --> 35:09.520]  even being more nuanced and understanding things
[35:09.520 --> 35:10.520]  that I didn't even understand.
[35:10.520 --> 35:14.520]  I mean, I've been learning stuff from Tucker Carlson.
[35:14.520 --> 35:15.520]  I don't know a lot of stuff from Joe
[35:15.520 --> 35:18.520]  when I have time to watch his program and tune in.
[35:18.520 --> 35:21.520]  On subjects I'm not, you know, really up on,
[35:21.520 --> 35:23.520]  but when it comes to geopolitics and the New World Order
[35:23.520 --> 35:26.520]  and the globalist and drug companies and their master plan,
[35:26.520 --> 35:30.520]  I've got the big, you know, 35,000-foot view of it.
[35:30.520 --> 35:32.520]  So that's a great thing.
[35:32.520 --> 35:34.520]  And we can't get mad at Dave Chappelle
[35:34.520 --> 35:37.520]  as he begins to wake up that he hasn't come super far yet
[35:37.520 --> 35:39.520]  because remember, we were once asleep.
[35:39.520 --> 35:41.520]  We were once just waking up.
[35:41.520 --> 35:44.520]  We were once babies in this as well.
[35:44.520 --> 35:47.520]  But Joe is no baby in this.
[35:47.520 --> 35:49.520]  And he wasn't 20-plus years ago when I knew him.
[35:49.520 --> 35:51.520]  He just chose not to believe this
[35:51.520 --> 35:54.520]  because it was too frustrating and too out of control.
[35:54.520 --> 35:56.520]  But as he saw things get worse and get bad, he said,
[35:56.520 --> 35:59.520]  I apologize, you know, I needed to set it on air.
[35:59.520 --> 36:01.520]  I needed to, you know, really come to grips
[36:01.520 --> 36:03.520]  with the fact that the world really is this bad
[36:03.520 --> 36:04.520]  and I didn't want to admit it.
[36:04.520 --> 36:05.520]  I just wanted to enjoy my life.
[36:05.520 --> 36:06.520]  And it looks like I can't do that.
[36:06.520 --> 36:08.520]  I'm going to have to fight him or I won't have a life.
[36:08.520 --> 36:11.520]  And that's the same process we all go through.
[36:11.520 --> 36:13.520]  I mean, I want to go watch movies.
[36:13.520 --> 36:14.520]  I want to go screw around.
[36:14.520 --> 36:15.520]  I want to go hunting.
[36:15.520 --> 36:16.520]  I want to go fishing.
[36:16.520 --> 36:19.520]  I want to go drive around the country and look at the mountains
[36:19.520 --> 36:22.520]  and look at the oceans and go deep-sea fishing.
[36:22.520 --> 36:24.520]  And I don't want to be doing this,
[36:24.520 --> 36:28.520]  but I have to because we will be slaves if we don't.
[36:28.520 --> 36:30.520]  In fact, now it's not, oh, the slavery's coming.
[36:30.520 --> 36:32.520]  It's here and it's getting worse by the minute.
[36:32.520 --> 36:35.520]  So I'll actually hit this top story next segment
[36:35.520 --> 36:36.520]  because I want to just have a whole segment
[36:36.520 --> 36:37.520]  to really drill into this.
[36:37.520 --> 36:41.520]  But let's just put that headline back up from Kit Daniels.
[36:41.520 --> 36:43.520]  And then it's got a 20-minute piece.
[36:43.520 --> 36:48.520]  You know, I did live on air last night laying all this out.
[36:48.520 --> 36:50.520]  But Debo's Group pushes vaccine passports
[36:50.520 --> 36:52.520]  to enforce global carbon taxes.
[36:52.520 --> 36:57.520]  Now, imagine the magnitude of that
[36:57.520 --> 37:01.520]  and realize what that signifies.
[37:01.520 --> 37:03.520]  What does that signify?
[37:03.520 --> 37:07.520]  A global consortium of corporations set up the UN.
[37:07.520 --> 37:10.520]  The UN three months ago put out a global standardization
[37:10.520 --> 37:14.520]  for a world vaccine passport.
[37:14.520 --> 37:17.520]  The Debo's Group is the one that submitted it.
[37:17.520 --> 37:19.520]  The corporations are the ones that are now going to implement it
[37:19.520 --> 37:21.520]  and enforce it on us.
[37:21.520 --> 37:23.520]  And it tracks you and taxes you
[37:23.520 --> 37:25.520]  and decides where you can go and what you can do
[37:25.520 --> 37:27.520]  and will then selectively be used
[37:27.520 --> 37:29.520]  to shut down all their competition.
[37:29.520 --> 37:32.520]  It won't just cost $150 trillion in the next decade
[37:32.520 --> 37:35.520]  as the UN officially released a report last week.
[37:35.520 --> 37:39.520]  It's not just $150 trillion in taxes on you.
[37:39.520 --> 37:42.520]  It's not just the global banks giving themselves that money
[37:42.520 --> 37:45.520]  to buy up more infrastructure and totally control our lives.
[37:45.520 --> 37:48.520]  It's designed to declare everything else non-essential
[37:48.520 --> 37:50.520]  and cut resources off to you.
[37:50.520 --> 37:53.520]  That's called siege.
[37:53.520 --> 37:55.520]  And so, yeah, it was theoretical
[37:55.520 --> 37:57.520]  and it's something Enron came up with in the early 90s
[37:57.520 --> 37:59.520]  and it's something that they adopted
[37:59.520 --> 38:01.520]  by the late 1990s as global policy.
[38:01.520 --> 38:03.520]  And now we're here in 2021
[38:03.520 --> 38:05.520]  and they're doing it
[38:05.520 --> 38:08.520]  and saying it's meant to depopulate the third world.
[38:08.520 --> 38:10.520]  But the survivors of the third world will then be used
[38:10.520 --> 38:13.520]  as a weapon to invade and take over the west
[38:13.520 --> 38:15.520]  under UN direction.
[38:17.520 --> 38:20.520]  So that's the big 35,000-foot view.
[38:20.520 --> 38:22.520]  That's the big boil-down.
[38:22.520 --> 38:26.520]  When I come back, I'm going to drill into all this
[38:26.520 --> 38:29.520]  separately.
[38:29.520 --> 38:32.520]  My friends, looking for my DNA Force Plus.
[38:32.520 --> 38:36.520]  It was on my desk and now it has been removed from my desk.
[38:36.520 --> 38:39.520]  Will someone please bring me a bottle of DNA Force Plus?
[38:39.520 --> 38:42.520]  And X2 has been taken off my counter.
[38:42.520 --> 38:45.520]  Will someone please find it for me?
[38:45.520 --> 38:47.520]  Oh, there it is. I found it. My fault.
[38:47.520 --> 38:50.520]  Okay, so you see these.
[38:50.520 --> 38:54.520]  This is basically sold out green fibers from the very best.
[38:57.520 --> 39:00.520]  Wheatgrass and the rest of it concentrated.
[39:00.520 --> 39:03.520]  But DNA Force Plus is back in stock.
[39:03.520 --> 39:06.520]  It's 40% off and I told you today would be the day
[39:06.520 --> 39:09.520]  that the sale ends because I've just been too busy
[39:09.520 --> 39:11.520]  working and covering news coming up with a new sale.
[39:11.520 --> 39:13.520]  And we're almost sold out of so many products.
[39:13.520 --> 39:16.520]  I don't even know what the new sale is going to be other than
[39:16.520 --> 39:18.520]  Ultimate Turmeric Formula is amazing.
[39:18.520 --> 39:20.520]  People love it. It's been sold out for four or five months.
[39:20.520 --> 39:23.520]  It's the highest level of cumanoids available.
[39:23.520 --> 39:26.520]  And that will soon be available the next few days for sale
[39:26.520 --> 39:28.520]  and will be discounted again.
[39:28.520 --> 39:30.520]  So we're very excited that that finally came back in
[39:30.520 --> 39:32.520]  because we won't cut the quality of the turmeric concentrate.
[39:32.520 --> 39:35.520]  And so it's been very, very hard to get it.
[39:35.520 --> 39:38.520]  And it's just super frustrating.
[39:38.520 --> 39:41.520]  At some point we may just say super high grade 95%
[39:41.520 --> 39:43.520]  concentrate is not available.
[39:43.520 --> 39:46.520]  And so now we've got this new system that's 75.
[39:46.520 --> 39:48.520]  I don't know what it's going to be. We're having to look around
[39:48.520 --> 39:49.520]  just in case we...
[39:49.520 --> 39:51.520]  But it won't be called Body's Ultimate Turmeric anymore
[39:51.520 --> 39:53.520]  if it's not that quality.
[39:53.520 --> 39:55.520]  We'll call it something new and tell you it's not as good
[39:55.520 --> 39:57.520]  as the old one. We just can't get it.
[39:57.520 --> 39:59.520]  It's being honest with people.
[39:59.520 --> 40:02.520]  So, but we do have the original bodies.
[40:02.520 --> 40:05.520]  The truck arrived when actually arrived today.
[40:05.520 --> 40:07.520]  They told me it's arriving today.
[40:07.520 --> 40:10.520]  We'll start selling it tomorrow.
[40:10.520 --> 40:11.520]  It'll be discounted.
[40:11.520 --> 40:14.520]  But right now, the big mega blowout sale,
[40:14.520 --> 40:16.520]  the emergency supply chain breakdown sale.
[40:16.520 --> 40:20.520]  Let me give you the actual name of it.
[40:20.520 --> 40:22.520]  Going from memory here.
[40:22.520 --> 40:24.520]  Info wars, emergency supply chain breakdown sale.

[42:07.520 --> 42:12.520]  People ask me all the time, Alex, the last three months or so, you've had explosive energy
[42:12.520 --> 42:15.520]  on top of your already very intense level of energy.
[42:15.520 --> 42:16.520]  What's happening?
[42:16.520 --> 42:18.520]  Well, it's the things that are happening in the world right now.
[42:18.520 --> 42:19.520]  That's got my blood up.
[42:19.520 --> 42:24.520]  But also, I've gotten back in the groove of religiously taking three products every single

[42:59.520 --> 43:01.520]  This is their trifecta.
[43:01.520 --> 43:08.520]  I suggest you check it out and experience what this does for your body today.
[43:08.520 --> 43:17.520]  InfoWare's emergency supply chain breakdown sale is only running for one week for a Monday,
[43:17.520 --> 43:20.520]  October 11th for seven days.
[43:20.520 --> 43:26.520]  That's because a bunch of these products that we have in stock are limited supply because,
[43:26.520 --> 43:31.520]  obviously, the supply chain breakdown that I've been warning you of now for 20 months
[43:31.520 --> 43:34.520]  because that's part of the great reset and part of the global's plan.
[43:34.520 --> 43:36.520]  That's what global lockdowns have been triggered.
[43:36.520 --> 43:39.520]  So we've not lowered the quality of any of our products.
[43:39.520 --> 43:43.520]  That means some of them have been sold out more than six months, like DNA Force Plus.
[43:43.520 --> 43:49.520]  It is 40% off, but coming up in one week, people go back to full price and we probably
[43:49.520 --> 43:52.520]  go back for up to six months, ladies and gentlemen.
[43:52.520 --> 43:54.520]  So it's a chance to support the broadcasts.
[43:54.520 --> 43:56.520]  They've got incredible products at the same time.
[43:56.520 --> 43:58.520]  Winner, Sun, Ultra 12, they're both 50% off.
[43:58.520 --> 44:01.520]  They're going to go back to 10% off in a week as well.
[44:01.520 --> 44:03.520]  They're 50% off right now.
[44:03.520 --> 44:06.520]  Find these and more at InfoWareStore.com and fund the InfoWare,
[44:06.520 --> 44:08.520]  making your life a lot healthier.
[44:08.520 --> 44:13.520]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[44:13.520 --> 44:19.520]  Half the population has lined up for an untested, deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[44:19.520 --> 44:23.520]  because they were told to be afraid of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[44:23.520 --> 44:29.520]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal of having 80% of the population hooked up to
[44:29.520 --> 44:33.520]  an artificial intelligence hive mind in less than nine years.
[44:33.520 --> 44:37.520]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell, we know this is all really happening
[44:37.520 --> 44:40.520]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[44:40.520 --> 44:43.520]  But there is only two things to do.
[44:43.520 --> 44:46.520]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[44:46.520 --> 44:49.520]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[44:49.520 --> 44:55.520]  But even when we win, and we eventually will, the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[44:55.520 --> 44:59.520]  And so we must prepare, get up to a year's worth of storable foods,
[44:59.520 --> 45:04.520]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds, shortwave radios,
[45:04.520 --> 45:11.520]  and lifesaving knowledge at infoorstore.com.
[45:34.520 --> 45:43.520]  My friends, you live to see it.
[45:43.520 --> 45:50.520]  In the month of October, in the year 2021, year of our Lord,
[45:50.520 --> 45:58.520]  revelation was fulfilled yet again with the establishment of a private corporate world government.
[45:58.520 --> 46:05.520]  Revelation says the world government will be run by merchants and ten kings and three superregions.
[46:05.520 --> 46:10.520]  And the UN is out of the world into three superregions with ten subsectors
[46:10.520 --> 46:16.520]  and is run by the corporate leaders, by the businessmen, by the traders.
[46:16.520 --> 46:20.520]  Now, either it's real and it's spiritual and it's manifesting,
[46:20.520 --> 46:22.520]  or they're using it as a blueprint of control.
[46:22.520 --> 46:25.520]  They're probably delusional and believe it's just a blueprint of control,
[46:25.520 --> 46:31.520]  nevertheless, it's happened. Or is it an ancestral memory of this happening on this planet,
[46:31.520 --> 46:37.520]  previous with another Atlantean civilization destroyed, or on another planet?
[46:37.520 --> 46:41.520]  I'm just theoretically putting out what's happening here.
[46:41.520 --> 46:46.520]  Or people just came up with this thousands of years ago magically and warned it was coming
[46:46.520 --> 46:49.520]  and entities from space came and warned them and said,
[46:49.520 --> 46:52.520]  you need to stop this and watch out when it happens because this is the main danger.
[46:52.520 --> 46:57.520]  This is how this fallen creature on this planet is going to try to take you over.
[46:57.520 --> 47:00.520]  And it's going to want your children.
[47:00.520 --> 47:03.520]  And it's going to want to kill your children.
[47:03.520 --> 47:10.520]  Wow, that must have been some good stuff that John the Revelator was smoking on the Isle of Patmos.
[47:10.520 --> 47:16.520]  Yes, and they're finding all over the world sunken cities in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean
[47:16.520 --> 47:24.520]  some structures bigger than the pyramids.
[47:24.520 --> 47:28.520]  Again, everything Plato basically said has now been dug up or found by Atlantis
[47:28.520 --> 47:31.520]  and he wrote his nonfiction book, The Republic, and it's all in there.
[47:31.520 --> 47:36.520]  He wrote other books about Atlantis, energy system, flying machines,
[47:36.520 --> 47:40.520]  giant metal machines that men stepped into, pretty wild stuff.
[47:40.520 --> 47:43.520]  Yeah, it wasn't the Japanese who came up with Transformers.
[47:43.520 --> 47:48.520]  You can try to figure out what this is, but the point is the people running things know
[47:48.520 --> 47:50.520]  and they want you dead.
[47:50.520 --> 47:53.520]  That's the directive they've been given.
[47:53.520 --> 47:57.520]  Now, to do that, they need to get you all signed up with a little digital minder
[47:57.520 --> 48:01.520]  that is a high-tech trillion-dollar designed total,
[48:01.520 --> 48:04.520]  a trillion dollars of money or more has gone into these phones,
[48:04.520 --> 48:07.520]  that tracks where you are, where you go, what you do that surveils you,
[48:07.520 --> 48:10.520]  that listens to you, that reads what you write,
[48:10.520 --> 48:13.520]  that you add off of what you say to your wife or husband.
[48:13.520 --> 48:14.520]  It's all admitted now.
[48:14.520 --> 48:16.520]  They give it to you, deny it's happening.
[48:16.520 --> 48:19.520]  Now that you're addicted, they admit it's all happening.
[48:19.520 --> 48:23.520]  And now over the phone, it's your chip you carry in your hand.
[48:23.520 --> 48:27.520]  Swab said soon, it'll be under your skin.
[48:27.520 --> 48:29.520]  That'll just be the new upgrade, the new requirement.
[48:29.520 --> 48:32.520]  He said, first it'll be your phone, then it'll be sewn under your clothing
[48:32.520 --> 48:35.520]  and then you'll have to have it under the skin under UN law.
[48:35.520 --> 48:38.520]  So they went to the UN, got a global COVID passport prepared,
[48:38.520 --> 48:40.520]  already had it previously prepared under an under name.
[48:40.520 --> 48:43.520]  They rolled it out three months ago.
[48:43.520 --> 48:47.520]  And then Debo Scroop puts out a video last week saying,
[48:47.520 --> 48:49.520]  oh, we're going to blood test you to travel.
[48:49.520 --> 48:50.520]  Everybody focused on that.
[48:50.520 --> 48:53.520]  But the other announcements were there's going to be a carbon tax
[48:53.520 --> 48:57.520]  that tracks what you buy, where you go, what you do with a carbon ration.
[48:57.520 --> 49:01.520]  And it'll decide when you can go somewhere, when you can fly on a plane,
[49:01.520 --> 49:04.520]  when you can leave your town, when you can get in a car.
[49:04.520 --> 49:08.520]  And you won't just be taxed, it will decide if you're allowed to even move.
[49:08.520 --> 49:13.520]  Remember Plandopolis put out by the Rockefeller Foundation, the UN,
[49:13.520 --> 49:20.520]  for elementary students in the United Kingdom, fifth and sixth graders.
[49:20.520 --> 49:24.520]  And it said, oh, your smartphone tells you when you can go outside.
[49:24.520 --> 49:26.520]  Your smartphone tells you when you can go to the store.
[49:26.520 --> 49:28.520]  Your smartphone tells you what type of job you'll have
[49:28.520 --> 49:34.520]  and your carbon allotment under the UN Global Food Council.
[49:34.520 --> 49:38.520]  They didn't just put out these cartoons for fifth and sixth graders in the UK,
[49:38.520 --> 49:40.520]  similar ones in Germany, put out by the UN where it says,
[49:40.520 --> 49:43.520]  when you're 14, you will take a Muslim husband.
[49:43.520 --> 49:45.520]  Muslim husbands are better than German husbands.
[49:45.520 --> 49:46.520]  These are real videos.
[49:46.520 --> 49:47.520]  I can blame for you.
[49:47.520 --> 49:50.520]  That's just the type of stuff they put on there.
[49:50.520 --> 49:54.520]  So, this is what they show children.
[49:54.520 --> 49:56.520]  This is what they show 10-year-olds.
[49:56.520 --> 50:02.520]  So, they show 9-year-olds.
[50:02.520 --> 50:05.520]  And now it's here.
[50:05.520 --> 50:07.520]  And so, here's the headline.
[50:07.520 --> 50:10.520]  Mark of the Beast officially announced Debo Scroob rolls out vaccine passports
[50:10.520 --> 50:13.520]  to enforce global carbon taxes to restrict travel.
[50:13.520 --> 50:15.520]  And then what's the final piece tied to that?
[50:15.520 --> 50:20.520]  I said it'll be a vaccine passport, told you this years ago,
[50:20.520 --> 50:24.520]  with, before they roll out COVID, then they'll call it a carbon tax pass
[50:24.520 --> 50:26.520]  connected to that.
[50:26.520 --> 50:28.520]  And then the final thing, your social credit score,
[50:28.520 --> 50:32.520]  which, again, is the beginning of the end.
[50:32.520 --> 50:34.520]  And that's the system, and that's the plan.
[50:34.520 --> 50:35.520]  They're rolling it out.
[50:35.520 --> 50:37.520]  And do you hear any of this from Rand Paul?
[50:37.520 --> 50:43.520]  Do you hear any of this from Tom Cotton or Ted Cruz?
[50:43.520 --> 50:45.520]  Because they're all as smart as I am or smarter.
[50:45.520 --> 50:46.520]  They all know this.
[50:46.520 --> 50:49.520]  But for some reason, Josh Hawley, all of them,
[50:49.520 --> 50:51.520]  just pay lip service to all this.
[50:51.520 --> 50:53.520]  They don't tell you, hey, world government's here.
[50:53.520 --> 50:54.520]  Hey, the UN ran this.
[50:54.520 --> 50:56.520]  They released the bio weapon.
[50:56.520 --> 50:57.520]  They're taking control of the US.
[50:57.520 --> 50:59.520]  The big corporations are enforcing this,
[50:59.520 --> 51:01.520]  and rolling this out through the airlines,
[51:01.520 --> 51:03.520]  through the businesses to make you do this,
[51:03.520 --> 51:06.520]  to have a job, or go to the hospital, or get on a plane.
[51:06.520 --> 51:08.520]  And then they're going to phase it right down to your daily life,
[51:08.520 --> 51:12.520]  where if you don't follow all the social credit score rules they have,
[51:12.520 --> 51:14.520]  they're going to demote you.
[51:14.520 --> 51:17.520]  The Chinese model, guys, pull up the Chinese model,
[51:17.520 --> 51:19.520]  is from like 1400, I think.
[51:19.520 --> 51:21.520]  I forget the actual number.
[51:21.520 --> 51:24.520]  And then that's the highest score you can get.
[51:24.520 --> 51:26.520]  And AIs watching you, and cameras are watching you,
[51:26.520 --> 51:28.520]  and special tattletales are watching you.
[51:28.520 --> 51:30.520]  They're able to go in, no judge, no jury,
[51:30.520 --> 51:32.520]  and just lower your credit score,
[51:32.520 --> 51:35.520]  and suddenly things cost you more.
[51:35.520 --> 51:41.520]  Yeah, so 850 is the maximum.
[51:41.520 --> 51:47.520]  And everybody starts out below that.
[51:47.520 --> 51:50.520]  And then it just goes from there.
[51:50.520 --> 51:52.520]  It's tied into everything.
[51:52.520 --> 51:54.520]  And it's already here, and this is the plan.
[51:54.520 --> 51:56.520]  But first they've got to bankrupt the world economy,
[51:56.520 --> 51:58.520]  first they've got to destroy the old to bring them the new,
[51:58.520 --> 52:03.520]  and they've got to use all the devaluation for them to buy up everything
[52:03.520 --> 52:05.520]  so that when everything shuts down,
[52:05.520 --> 52:07.520]  they own the farms, the ranches, the auto parts stores,
[52:07.520 --> 52:11.520]  the machine shops, the supplement factories, everything.
[52:11.520 --> 52:14.520]  The tile factories, the flooring factories, the light bulb factories.
[52:14.520 --> 52:16.520]  They're going around buying everything globally
[52:16.520 --> 52:18.520]  for five times what it's worth in many cases,
[52:18.520 --> 52:21.520]  and shutting it down, closing them.
[52:21.520 --> 52:24.520]  Not so their established companies make more money.
[52:24.520 --> 52:25.520]  Oh, that's part of it.
[52:25.520 --> 52:28.520]  Vertical integration, vertical consolidation.
[52:28.520 --> 52:30.520]  No.
[52:30.520 --> 52:32.520]  It's because they don't want you to have a job
[52:32.520 --> 52:34.520]  or know how to have a job, or know how to do machining,
[52:34.520 --> 52:36.520]  or know how to restart communities
[52:36.520 --> 52:38.520]  because they're going to collapse everything
[52:38.520 --> 52:40.520]  and then cut off the food and start mass starvation.
[52:40.520 --> 52:42.520]  Now I've been telling you this every hour
[52:42.520 --> 52:44.520]  of every show for 20-plus years.
[52:44.520 --> 52:45.520]  Now it's here.
[52:45.520 --> 52:47.520]  And here's some of the headlines today.
[52:47.520 --> 52:50.520]  Hashtag empty shelves trends.
[52:50.520 --> 52:54.520]  Hashtag empty shelves Joe Trends dominates Twitter
[52:54.520 --> 52:57.520]  as ships back up the ports
[52:57.520 --> 52:59.520]  and by administration blames Trump.
[52:59.520 --> 53:00.520]  Here's another one.
[53:00.520 --> 53:04.520]  Supermarkets in Germany can now block entry to the unvaccinated,
[53:04.520 --> 53:05.520]  and they're saying they are.
[53:05.520 --> 53:08.520]  This is out of the locals.de.
[53:08.520 --> 53:10.520]  Can't buy or sell.
[53:10.520 --> 53:12.520]  First, if you don't have the shot,
[53:12.520 --> 53:14.520]  then it's if you have the wrong political views.
[53:14.520 --> 53:15.520]  They're already announcing that.
[53:15.520 --> 53:18.520]  U.S. Treasury deputary sec warns unvaccinated Americans
[53:18.520 --> 53:21.520]  that shortages will continue until everyone is jabbed.
[53:21.520 --> 53:22.520]  Oh, and there's more jabs.
[53:22.520 --> 53:26.520]  UK's chicken king warns the era of cheap food is over.
[53:26.520 --> 53:28.520]  Remember what CNN said last week?
[53:28.520 --> 53:30.520]  They said the before time.
[53:30.520 --> 53:32.520]  They said COVID is teaching us to have less.
[53:32.520 --> 53:35.520]  It's good because they're teaching you to be poor,
[53:35.520 --> 53:37.520]  to control you, but they're going to be richer
[53:37.520 --> 53:38.520]  and more powerful than ever
[53:38.520 --> 53:40.520]  and test all their new biologicals on you
[53:40.520 --> 53:42.520]  to give themselves churs of diseases.
[53:42.520 --> 53:45.520]  You just get to die.
[53:45.520 --> 53:48.520]  And meanwhile, it's official,
[53:48.520 --> 53:51.520]  the Navy now to separate unvaccinated sexual predators
[53:51.520 --> 53:53.520]  and criminals on the database,
[53:53.520 --> 53:55.520]  making it criminal in your social credit score
[53:55.520 --> 53:58.520]  if you don't take the deadly shot.
[53:58.520 --> 53:59.520]  And then it gets worse.
[53:59.520 --> 54:00.520]  We now know what FEMA's doing.
[54:00.520 --> 54:03.520]  $100 plus billion left over from all the spending last year
[54:03.520 --> 54:05.520]  to shore up hospitals that were going to be hit
[54:05.520 --> 54:10.520]  by millions of dying, 15 days of flatten the curve.
[54:10.520 --> 54:12.520]  Now, the hospital groups are firing all these nurses
[54:12.520 --> 54:14.520]  to trigger the emergency FEMA money,
[54:14.520 --> 54:17.520]  bring in FEMA operatives who are not inoculated,
[54:17.520 --> 54:19.520]  who are not injected with a franken shot.
[54:19.520 --> 54:20.520]  They don't have to be.
[54:20.520 --> 54:21.520]  It wasn't about that.
[54:21.520 --> 54:23.520]  It was about getting rid of the regular employees
[54:23.520 --> 54:25.520]  to trigger the emergency to federalize medicine
[54:25.520 --> 54:28.520]  and then bring in the $100 billion to the medical groups
[54:28.520 --> 54:33.520]  who help write the regulations.
[54:33.520 --> 54:36.520]  Biden's FEMA has taken full control of America's health care,
[54:36.520 --> 54:38.520]  and it's about to get worse.
[54:38.520 --> 54:40.520]  That's yesterday's full show.
[54:40.520 --> 54:41.520]  So it ain't coming.
[54:41.520 --> 54:42.520]  It's here.
[54:42.520 --> 54:44.520]  The good part is I don't have to sit here and tell you
[54:44.520 --> 54:46.520]  it's coming anymore and show you documents like I used to.
[54:46.520 --> 54:50.520]  You're just going to live it now.
[54:50.520 --> 54:52.520]  And let me just show you from the actual scans,
[54:52.520 --> 54:54.520]  you know, screenshots of the video,
[54:54.520 --> 54:56.520]  the little minute 44 Debo's video
[54:56.520 --> 54:58.520]  they just put out last Thursday.
[54:58.520 --> 54:59.520]  Here it is.
[54:59.520 --> 55:04.520]  COVID Pass plans to launch in September.
[55:04.520 --> 55:06.520]  This app could help revive global travel
[55:06.520 --> 55:08.520]  in large events during the pandemic
[55:08.520 --> 55:10.520]  when they're the ones that triggered it and did the lockdown.
[55:10.520 --> 55:11.520]  See, they hold you hostage.
[55:11.520 --> 55:13.520]  And as you get deeper in here, they say,
[55:13.520 --> 55:15.520]  oh, yeah, we're going to take your blood.
[55:15.520 --> 55:17.520]  Yeah, you have total privacy.
[55:17.520 --> 55:19.520]  It's the opposite of that.
[55:19.520 --> 55:20.520]  We scan everything you do.
[55:20.520 --> 55:21.520]  We track you.
[55:21.520 --> 55:23.520]  And then they say, yeah, we're going to have carbon taxes tied to it,
[55:23.520 --> 55:24.520]  and it's already being implemented,
[55:24.520 --> 55:26.520]  and it'll also help cut travel.
[55:26.520 --> 55:29.520]  It commits to mandatory carbon offsetting
[55:29.520 --> 55:32.520]  for each of its passengers through the app.
[55:32.520 --> 55:35.520]  Oh, to preserve environmental benefits
[55:35.520 --> 55:38.520]  of reduced air travel during the crisis.
[55:38.520 --> 55:40.520]  Oh, my gosh, we're going to cut air travel
[55:40.520 --> 55:42.520]  by charging you more to save the earth,
[55:42.520 --> 55:44.520]  just like during the lockdown.
[55:44.520 --> 55:45.520]  It already happened.
[55:45.520 --> 55:47.520]  So this is the new carbon lockdown,
[55:47.520 --> 55:49.520]  which they said they would do two years ago.
[55:49.520 --> 55:50.520]  See how it works?
[55:50.520 --> 55:53.520]  Being put under the leftist global transhumanist
[55:53.520 --> 55:55.520]  post-human dictatorship.
[55:55.520 --> 55:57.520]  You're now in the Mark of the Beach New World Order.
[55:57.520 --> 56:02.520]  InfoWars emergency supply chain breakdown sale
[56:02.520 --> 56:06.520]  is only running for one week from Monday,
[56:06.520 --> 56:09.520]  October 11th, for seven days.
[56:09.520 --> 56:14.520]  That's because a bunch of these products that we have in stock
[56:14.520 --> 56:16.520]  are limited supply because, obviously,
[56:16.520 --> 56:19.520]  the supply chain breakdown that I've been warning you of now
[56:19.520 --> 56:22.520]  for 20 months, because that's part of the great reset
[56:22.520 --> 56:23.520]  at part of the global's plan,
[56:23.520 --> 56:26.520]  and that's what global lockdowns have been triggered.
[56:26.520 --> 56:28.520]  So we've not lowered the quality of any of our products.
[56:28.520 --> 56:30.520]  That means some of them have been sold out
[56:30.520 --> 56:33.520]  more than six months, like DNA Force Plus.
[56:33.520 --> 56:36.520]  It is 40% off, but coming up in one week,
[56:36.520 --> 56:38.520]  it will go back to full price,
[56:38.520 --> 56:39.520]  and we probably won't have more
[56:39.520 --> 56:42.520]  for up to six months, ladies and gentlemen.
[56:42.520 --> 56:44.520]  So it's a chance to support the broadcast,
[56:44.520 --> 56:46.520]  get incredible products at the same time.
[56:46.520 --> 56:48.520]  Winner, Sun, Ultra 12, they're both 50% off.
[56:48.520 --> 56:51.520]  They're going to go back to 10% off in a week as well.
[56:51.520 --> 56:53.520]  They're 50% off right now.
[56:53.520 --> 56:55.520]  Find these and more at infowarstore.com
[56:55.520 --> 56:56.520]  and fund the Info World,
[56:56.520 --> 56:59.520]  making your life a lot healthier.
[56:59.520 --> 57:01.520]  At the time of cutting this announcement,
[57:01.520 --> 57:07.520]  it is the morning of Sunday, October 17th.
[57:07.520 --> 57:11.520]  And that means there is less than 48 hours left
[57:11.520 --> 57:16.520]  to take advantage of our emergency mega blowout sale
[57:16.520 --> 57:19.520]  that is tied directly to the supply chain breakdowns
[57:19.520 --> 57:23.520]  happening across the world by design for the great reset.
[57:23.520 --> 57:25.520]  As the central banks attempt to bankrupt
[57:25.520 --> 57:27.520]  the mainline economy to consolidate it
[57:27.520 --> 57:30.520]  and then to move in with the quadrillions
[57:30.520 --> 57:32.520]  of fake currency they have to buy up
[57:32.520 --> 57:33.520]  what's left of the infrastructure
[57:33.520 --> 57:36.520]  that they don't already control.
[57:36.520 --> 57:37.520]  This is economic warfare.
[57:37.520 --> 57:39.520]  And so Info War is under attack
[57:39.520 --> 57:42.520]  like every other pro-American independent organization
[57:42.520 --> 57:43.520]  and we need funding.
[57:43.520 --> 57:45.520]  And so despite the fact that we're running out
[57:45.520 --> 57:47.520]  of a lot of our best selling products,
[57:47.520 --> 57:49.520]  I'm still offering them at huge sale prices
[57:49.520 --> 57:52.520]  because I need to move them out and get the capital in.
[57:52.520 --> 57:53.520]  So take advantage of this sale.
[57:53.520 --> 57:55.520]  It's only running until Monday night.
[57:55.520 --> 57:59.520]  At infowarstore.com
[57:59.520 --> 58:25.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[58:25.520 --> 58:36.520]  It's an important report and I'm not critiquing it
[58:36.520 --> 58:37.520]  when I say this.
[58:37.520 --> 58:40.520]  I'm just saying Cuomo and the rest of these people
[58:40.520 --> 58:41.520]  are just mid-level minions.
[58:41.520 --> 58:43.520]  The scumbag New Jersey governor,
[58:43.520 --> 58:45.520]  the rest of them are just scumbag minions.
[58:45.520 --> 58:46.520]  The show is biting.
[58:46.520 --> 58:48.520]  We need to be talking about Bill Gates,
[58:48.520 --> 58:51.520]  Klaus Schwab, the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers,
[58:51.520 --> 58:52.520]  the people up above that.
[58:52.520 --> 58:54.520]  That's who launched this attack.
[58:54.520 --> 58:56.520]  Colin Powell isn't nobody to these people.
[58:56.520 --> 58:57.520]  He died in blowback.
[58:57.520 --> 58:59.520]  Obviously, he didn't get the memo to not take
[58:59.520 --> 59:02.520]  the deadly vaccine, took the deadly vaccine and died.
[59:02.520 --> 59:03.520]  So here's the report.
[59:03.520 --> 59:04.520]  It's an important report.
[59:04.520 --> 59:06.520]  It's a good report, but it's only one level of it.
[59:06.520 --> 59:07.520]  Here it is.
[59:09.520 --> 59:13.520]  As the seats of power shift in the governor's seats
[59:13.520 --> 59:15.520]  in New York and New Jersey.
[59:15.520 --> 59:17.520]  I've got seven years, four months and one day
[59:17.520 --> 59:18.520]  and I am gone.
[59:18.520 --> 59:20.520]  I am sending my daughters to school out of state
[59:20.520 --> 59:22.520]  with orders never to return.
[59:22.520 --> 59:23.520]  This state is too expensive.
[59:23.520 --> 59:24.520]  I think I got the point.
[59:24.520 --> 59:25.520]  You're making it worse.
[59:25.520 --> 59:26.520]  I got the point.
[59:26.520 --> 59:28.520]  The truth behind the bureaucratic mass deaths
[59:28.520 --> 59:31.520]  in nursing homes and veterans hospitals
[59:31.520 --> 59:33.520]  bubbles to the surface.
[59:33.520 --> 59:35.520]  Was it a Cuomo cover-up?
[59:35.520 --> 59:38.520]  That is a burning question today after a top Cuomo aide
[59:38.520 --> 59:40.520]  appears to admit that the governor's office
[59:40.520 --> 59:43.520]  intentionally delayed releasing COVID death numbers
[59:43.520 --> 59:45.520]  at nursing homes to state legislators
[59:45.520 --> 59:47.520]  because they were worried a federal investigation
[59:47.520 --> 59:48.520]  was underway.
[59:48.520 --> 59:50.520]  An attorney representing victims' families
[59:50.520 --> 59:52.520]  says the numbers show the problem.
[59:52.520 --> 59:55.520]  At first, just 9,000 deaths linked to nursing homes
[59:55.520 --> 59:57.520]  and long-term care facilities were reported
[59:57.520 --> 59:59.520]  when the state attorney general says
[59:59.520 --> 1:00:01.520]  the real number was 15,000.
[1:00:01.520 --> 1:00:03.520]  This is just one big cover-up.
[1:00:03.520 --> 1:00:06.520]  Cuomo's troubles escalated when his chief of staff admitted
[1:00:06.520 --> 1:00:09.520]  the state withheld nursing home fatality numbers
[1:00:09.520 --> 1:00:12.520]  from the legislature because Cuomo's staff worried
[1:00:12.520 --> 1:00:15.520]  they'd be used against us by the Trump White House.
[1:00:15.520 --> 1:00:17.520]  Families presented Governor Hockel with a booklet
[1:00:17.520 --> 1:00:20.520]  filled with photos of many seniors who died.
[1:00:20.520 --> 1:00:23.520]  And they're demanding the creation of a victims' compensation
[1:00:23.520 --> 1:00:26.520]  fund for nursing home COVID victims and the families
[1:00:26.520 --> 1:00:27.520]  they left behind.
[1:00:27.520 --> 1:00:30.520]  As New York totalitarian governor Kathy Hockel
[1:00:30.520 --> 1:00:34.520]  took over the reins, she piled on another 12,000
[1:00:34.520 --> 1:00:38.520]  unreported deaths to the New York COVID death toll.
[1:00:38.520 --> 1:00:41.520]  And now, after 19 long months, Hockel,
[1:00:41.520 --> 1:00:44.520]  the self-proclaimed COVID messiah.
[1:00:44.520 --> 1:00:47.520]  He made them come up with a vaccine.
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:49.520]  That is from God to us.
[1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:53.520]  Is finally apologizing for Cuomo's mass death toll
[1:00:53.520 --> 1:00:55.520]  in nursing homes.
[1:00:55.520 --> 1:00:58.520]  A massacre Hockel oversaw as well
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:00.520]  when she was Lieutenant Governor.
[1:01:00.520 --> 1:01:02.520]  According to the New York Post,
[1:01:02.520 --> 1:01:06.520]  over the summer, a 242-page report
[1:01:06.520 --> 1:01:10.520]  by the New York State Bar Association quietly revealed
[1:01:10.520 --> 1:01:13.520]  that Cuomo's directive for New York nursing homes
[1:01:13.520 --> 1:01:17.520]  to admit COVID-19 patients increased the death toll
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:19.520]  among residents.
[1:01:19.520 --> 1:01:23.520]  And Cuomo's claims otherwise have been disproven.
[1:01:23.520 --> 1:01:26.520]  New York State Bar Association's task force
[1:01:26.520 --> 1:01:30.520]  on nursing homes and long-term care also blasts Cuomo
[1:01:30.520 --> 1:01:33.520]  for not reversing the Department of Health's
[1:01:33.520 --> 1:01:36.520]  unreasonable mandate sooner than he did,
[1:01:36.520 --> 1:01:40.520]  saying it remained in effect weeks longer than necessary.
[1:01:40.520 --> 1:01:44.520]  Meanwhile, in New Jersey, a federal investigation
[1:01:44.520 --> 1:01:46.520]  is ramping up.
[1:01:46.520 --> 1:01:48.520]  In New Jersey, the federal investigation
[1:01:48.520 --> 1:01:51.520]  appears to be only focused on Paramus and Menlo Park,
[1:01:51.520 --> 1:01:54.520]  not the other long-term care facilities,
[1:01:54.520 --> 1:01:57.520]  where nearly 8,000 residents and dozens of staff members
[1:01:57.520 --> 1:01:59.520]  lost their lives.
[1:01:59.520 --> 1:02:02.520]  If there's a federal investigation going on on something,
[1:02:02.520 --> 1:02:05.520]  you can assume up front that we're not going to have
[1:02:05.520 --> 1:02:07.520]  any commentary.
[1:02:07.520 --> 1:02:10.520]  It's estimated around 192 residents fatally contracted
[1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:12.520]  the coronavirus in the state's Menlo Park
[1:02:12.520 --> 1:02:14.520]  and Paramus Veterans homes.
[1:02:14.520 --> 1:02:16.520]  Loved ones have said at one point,
[1:02:16.520 --> 1:02:18.520]  the facilities did not have staff or patients
[1:02:18.520 --> 1:02:20.520]  wearing masks, and COVID-positive residents
[1:02:20.520 --> 1:02:22.520]  were allowed to roam the hallways.
[1:02:22.520 --> 1:02:25.520]  You're not taking proper precautions.
[1:02:25.520 --> 1:02:28.520]  So they are just letting it spread rapidly
[1:02:28.520 --> 1:02:30.520]  throughout that building.
[1:02:30.520 --> 1:02:33.520]  New Jersey Governor Murphy, again,
[1:02:33.520 --> 1:02:36.520]  offered apologies and praise for the troops
[1:02:36.520 --> 1:02:39.520]  as a deflection for his own responsibility
[1:02:39.520 --> 1:02:42.520]  in the deaths of those that gave their lives
[1:02:42.520 --> 1:02:44.520]  for offending the United States.
[1:02:44.520 --> 1:02:47.520]  You know, the system is truly broken
[1:02:47.520 --> 1:02:50.520]  when after killing the patriarch's matriarchs
[1:02:50.520 --> 1:02:53.520]  and heroes within American families
[1:02:53.520 --> 1:02:55.520]  with their psychotic bureaucracy,
[1:02:55.520 --> 1:02:59.520]  the best we can hope for is an apology.
[1:02:59.520 --> 1:03:03.520]  On behalf of John Bowne, this is Darren McBreen reporting.
[1:03:03.520 --> 1:03:05.520]  All right, folks.
[1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:07.520]  We're going to come back with solutions.
[1:03:07.520 --> 1:03:09.520]  We'll be back in 60 seconds.
[1:03:09.520 --> 1:03:15.520]  If you only knew the power of the dark side,
[1:03:15.520 --> 1:03:19.520]  join Bill Gates, and together,
[1:03:19.520 --> 1:03:22.520]  we will defeat humanity.
[1:03:22.520 --> 1:03:28.520]  Then our gods will reward us with eternal life.
[1:03:28.520 --> 1:03:32.520]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[1:03:32.520 --> 1:03:34.520]  They must first play God.
[1:03:34.520 --> 1:03:38.520]  They must first prove that they are the fittest
[1:03:38.520 --> 1:03:40.520]  in their social Darwinistic system.
[1:03:40.520 --> 1:03:42.520]  And in a way, they're right.
[1:03:42.520 --> 1:03:45.520]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us
[1:03:45.520 --> 1:03:48.520]  and destroy our children's futures
[1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:50.520]  and the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open,
[1:03:50.520 --> 1:03:53.520]  we really deserve what's happened to us.
[1:03:53.520 --> 1:03:57.520]  So I ask you now, are you going to step up
[1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:00.520]  and expose the new order even more?
[1:04:00.520 --> 1:04:03.520]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[1:04:03.520 --> 1:04:08.520]  The front lines of the fight is infowars.com.
[1:04:34.520 --> 1:04:37.520]  My four-year-old daughter loves this song.
[1:04:37.520 --> 1:04:39.520]  She loves old TV themes.
[1:04:39.520 --> 1:04:41.520]  We were driving around yesterday.
[1:04:41.520 --> 1:04:43.520]  I took her to the local park in the morning.
[1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:44.520]  We were driving back.
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:47.520]  She said, I want to hear Hawaii 50.
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:49.520]  Ta-da-da-da-da.
[1:04:49.520 --> 1:04:53.520]  And here we are listening to it right now together.
[1:04:53.520 --> 1:04:54.520]  Humans made that.
[1:04:54.520 --> 1:04:57.520]  A great orchestra made that beautiful music.
[1:04:57.520 --> 1:04:58.520]  We're incredible.
[1:04:58.520 --> 1:04:59.520]  We're made by God.
[1:04:59.520 --> 1:05:01.520]  Humans are good, not bad.
[1:05:01.520 --> 1:05:04.520]  We're not going to let a bunch of nasty globalists,
[1:05:04.520 --> 1:05:06.520]  the worst of our species, tell us we're trash
[1:05:06.520 --> 1:05:08.520]  and we've got to die so they can have the future.
[1:05:08.520 --> 1:05:10.520]  We're not going to accept a world ID,
[1:05:10.520 --> 1:05:12.520]  world cashless society, where they admit
[1:05:12.520 --> 1:05:15.520]  they're going to use it to control every aspect of our lives.
[1:05:15.520 --> 1:05:16.520]  This isn't coming.
[1:05:16.520 --> 1:05:18.520]  This is here.
[1:05:18.520 --> 1:05:21.520]  Now I want to give the number out coming up next segment
[1:05:21.520 --> 1:05:23.520]  and take calls throughout the balance of transmission,
[1:05:23.520 --> 1:05:28.520]  interspersed a ton of huge news and massive information.
[1:05:28.520 --> 1:05:33.520]  But I want to just take a deep breath and think
[1:05:33.520 --> 1:05:35.520]  about something here.
[1:05:35.520 --> 1:05:39.520]  We focus on the puppets of the New World Order.
[1:05:39.520 --> 1:05:42.520]  We focus on the Boris Johnson's and the Barack Obama's
[1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:46.520]  and the Hillary Clinton's and the Joe Biden's
[1:05:46.520 --> 1:05:49.520]  and the McCrons and all the red and the Merkel's.
[1:05:49.520 --> 1:05:50.520]  They're just minions.
[1:05:50.520 --> 1:05:53.520]  They're just front people for the globalists.
[1:05:53.520 --> 1:05:55.520]  They're basically actors.
[1:05:55.520 --> 1:06:02.520]  They're little trusted sycophantic bootlickers.
[1:06:02.520 --> 1:06:09.520]  But when we talk about leadership,
[1:06:09.520 --> 1:06:14.520]  people like Nigel Farage, people like Rand Paul,
[1:06:14.520 --> 1:06:20.520]  people like that, do you hear them attacking
[1:06:20.520 --> 1:06:22.520]  what's currently happening?
[1:06:22.520 --> 1:06:24.520]  And you actually do with Nigel Farage.
[1:06:24.520 --> 1:06:27.520]  When it comes to big picture and actually covering every fact
[1:06:27.520 --> 1:06:29.520]  that it's a world corporate government takeover,
[1:06:29.520 --> 1:06:33.520]  that the vaccine passports are for a global carbon tax,
[1:06:33.520 --> 1:06:39.520]  I mean, he gets it.
[1:06:39.520 --> 1:06:45.520]  But when you talk about our leaders here in the United States,
[1:06:45.520 --> 1:06:47.520]  Rand Paul was on TV this weekend.
[1:06:47.520 --> 1:06:49.520]  Rand Paul warns against socialism.
[1:06:49.520 --> 1:06:52.520]  It always ends up in state sponsored authoritarianism
[1:06:52.520 --> 1:06:54.520]  and violence, close quote.
[1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:55.520]  That's a great statement.
[1:06:55.520 --> 1:06:56.520]  It's totally true.
[1:06:56.520 --> 1:06:59.520]  Quote, it always ends up with state sponsored authoritarianism
[1:06:59.520 --> 1:07:00.520]  and violence.
[1:07:00.520 --> 1:07:03.520]  And that's where we are.
[1:07:03.520 --> 1:07:05.520]  Violently coming after an experimental shot
[1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:08.520]  that they had actually tested that they knew caused ADE
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:11.520]  and a bunch of other serious disorders and deaths.
[1:07:11.520 --> 1:07:13.520]  Now Colin Powell took the shot and died
[1:07:13.520 --> 1:07:17.520]  and Hank Aaron, everybody else you can imagine.
[1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:19.520]  All these other people take it and almost die.
[1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:20.520]  All these children take it.
[1:07:20.520 --> 1:07:22.520]  Olympic athletes take it.
[1:07:22.520 --> 1:07:24.520]  NBA players take it and are out forever
[1:07:24.520 --> 1:07:29.520]  because Michael Carditis.
[1:07:29.520 --> 1:07:32.520]  They're assaulting us.
[1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:35.520]  But I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
[1:07:35.520 --> 1:07:39.520]  Should I go protest at Rand Paul's office
[1:07:39.520 --> 1:07:40.520]  to say, hey, you're a great guy.
[1:07:40.520 --> 1:07:42.520]  You're a major leader.
[1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:45.520]  Will you please point out this is a UN corporate takeover
[1:07:45.520 --> 1:07:49.520]  and that the Davos group went to the UN over a year ago.
[1:07:49.520 --> 1:07:51.520]  They had a previous plan five years ago
[1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:55.520]  for a global vaccine passport QR code system.
[1:07:55.520 --> 1:07:58.520]  They already had it ready under disease X and other names.
[1:07:58.520 --> 1:08:00.520]  And then once you adopt that and once the UN says
[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:03.520]  this is the standardized system, everybody should use.
[1:08:03.520 --> 1:08:06.520]  The corporations implement it and then it controls
[1:08:06.520 --> 1:08:10.520]  everything we do and becomes the new cashless society
[1:08:10.520 --> 1:08:12.520]  and the new carbon trading system
[1:08:12.520 --> 1:08:14.520]  and tells us where we can go and what we can do
[1:08:14.520 --> 1:08:17.520]  and tells us we're allowed outside our houses.
[1:08:17.520 --> 1:08:20.520]  That has officially been announced.
[1:08:20.520 --> 1:08:24.520]  And I showed you earlier the actual Davos group video
[1:08:24.520 --> 1:08:27.520]  and I showed you screenshots where it says on there
[1:08:27.520 --> 1:08:30.520]  just like the pandemic was the pandemic.
[1:08:30.520 --> 1:08:32.520]  It was the lockdown that they put in place using the pandemic
[1:08:32.520 --> 1:08:36.520]  as the excuse, cut global air travel and cut carbon emissions.
[1:08:36.520 --> 1:08:38.520]  We're going to cut it by carbon taxes
[1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:40.520]  via your vaccine passport.
[1:08:40.520 --> 1:08:44.520]  They say that.
[1:08:44.520 --> 1:08:47.520]  Now again, I know we've said this a thousand times or more on air
[1:08:47.520 --> 1:08:49.520]  but now it's here.
[1:08:49.520 --> 1:08:53.520]  And I go and I search for someone pointing out
[1:08:53.520 --> 1:09:04.520]  that Davos group rolls out UN approved global ID.
[1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:05.520]  That's what this is.
[1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:09.520]  This is a global UN run corporate controlled designed
[1:09:09.520 --> 1:09:12.520]  world ID that Xi Jinping a year and a half ago said
[1:09:12.520 --> 1:09:16.520]  we need to adopt the UN QR code global standard
[1:09:16.520 --> 1:09:18.520]  vaccine passport.
[1:09:18.520 --> 1:09:19.520]  You pull that up.
[1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:24.520]  Xi Jinping calls for global QR code under UN standards.
[1:09:24.520 --> 1:09:29.520]  And here we are under Xi Jinping UN Fortune 500
[1:09:29.520 --> 1:09:32.520]  announcement for a tracking system on your phone
[1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:35.520]  to go to a sporting event, a grocery store to have a job
[1:09:35.520 --> 1:09:38.520]  to go to a hospital to get on a bus, a train or an airplane
[1:09:38.520 --> 1:09:43.520]  or buy a car or have a bank account.
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:45.520]  And then they have the nerve to say in the piece
[1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:48.520]  and this has zero tracking.
[1:09:48.520 --> 1:09:51.520]  That's like saying a great white shark is not a shark.
[1:09:51.520 --> 1:09:53.520]  This great white shark has nothing to do
[1:09:53.520 --> 1:09:55.520]  with a great white shark.
[1:09:55.520 --> 1:09:57.520]  King Kong has nothing to do with a gorilla.
[1:09:57.520 --> 1:10:01.520]  Donkey Kong has nothing to do with a gorilla or video games.
[1:10:01.520 --> 1:10:08.520]  The color blue has nothing to do with blue.
[1:10:08.520 --> 1:10:12.520]  And they lie on purpose just to get you used to being lied to
[1:10:12.520 --> 1:10:14.520]  like, oh, they're catching us in lies.
[1:10:14.520 --> 1:10:16.520]  All right, do the psychological warfare technique
[1:10:16.520 --> 1:10:22.520]  of just lying constantly until it's just a tissue of lies.
[1:10:22.520 --> 1:10:25.520]  That's called complete gaslighting.
[1:10:25.520 --> 1:10:27.520]  So we're here.
[1:10:27.520 --> 1:10:29.520]  And you know, I meant to get to this Friday.
[1:10:29.520 --> 1:10:32.520]  Saturday and Sunday I did shows.
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:34.520]  The problem is I've already read this several times
[1:10:34.520 --> 1:10:35.520]  and I'm already aware of their operations.
[1:10:35.520 --> 1:10:37.520]  And once I see it again, it's hard to read it on air.
[1:10:37.520 --> 1:10:38.520]  It gets me so angry.
[1:10:38.520 --> 1:10:41.520]  But you know what?
[1:10:41.520 --> 1:10:44.520]  We'll take phone calls starting at the bottom of the hour
[1:10:44.520 --> 1:10:45.520]  and I'll take them to the bottom of the next hour.
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:49.520]  And then I'm going to read from the document,
[1:10:49.520 --> 1:10:53.520]  NATO's plan to hack your brain.
[1:10:53.520 --> 1:10:57.520]  And of course, what they're telling you now is like 30 years old.
[1:10:57.520 --> 1:11:02.520]  The sixth dimension of warfare is mind war.
[1:11:02.520 --> 1:11:04.520]  You may have heard of it before on a certain show.
[1:11:04.520 --> 1:11:06.520]  It's called info war.
[1:11:06.520 --> 1:11:08.520]  We use the truth to counter lies.
[1:11:08.520 --> 1:11:12.520]  We use logic and stability and God's law in a system
[1:11:12.520 --> 1:11:15.520]  that's totally transparent and self-generating.
[1:11:15.520 --> 1:11:18.520]  They have a system of putting you into a total artificial reality
[1:11:18.520 --> 1:11:23.520]  of complete fraud, total immersion in a matrix-like system.
[1:11:23.520 --> 1:11:26.520]  This is the only way they can get you to go with them
[1:11:26.520 --> 1:11:30.520]  and accept them and be convinced as being born into this as a child.
[1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:34.520]  And this is a proto matrix, the VR goggles and the smart phones
[1:11:34.520 --> 1:11:36.520]  and the screens and the 10 hours of screen time
[1:11:36.520 --> 1:11:38.520]  and they're being plugged into it.
[1:11:38.520 --> 1:11:40.520]  And then finally, hey, there's a wire in your head.
[1:11:40.520 --> 1:11:42.520]  You got to pick up the new season of your favorite show
[1:11:42.520 --> 1:11:44.520]  by getting this chip in your head.
[1:11:44.520 --> 1:11:45.520]  This isn't five years out.
[1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:46.520]  This is a year out.
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:49.520]  This is already happening with the military.
[1:11:49.520 --> 1:11:53.520]  Yeah, they're already putting wires into CIA operatives' brains
[1:11:53.520 --> 1:11:54.520]  and the rest of it.
[1:11:54.520 --> 1:11:56.520]  It's been going on a while.
[1:11:56.520 --> 1:11:59.520]  They're also giving them, quote, vaccines that augment them,
[1:11:59.520 --> 1:12:01.520]  that actually go in and change brain chemistry,
[1:12:01.520 --> 1:12:03.520]  that aren't vaccines.
[1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:06.520]  They're genetic engineering.
[1:12:06.520 --> 1:12:08.520]  We're not in the year 2020.
[1:12:08.520 --> 1:12:14.520]  We're not in the year 2021.
[1:12:14.520 --> 1:12:18.520]  We're really in the year 3000.
[1:12:18.520 --> 1:12:21.520]  And I mean that hypothetically.
[1:12:21.520 --> 1:12:23.520]  Don't think of this as 2021.
[1:12:23.520 --> 1:12:26.520]  It's a 30, 40, 50 years of advanced technology
[1:12:26.520 --> 1:12:29.520]  that's so advanced and no longer theoretical
[1:12:29.520 --> 1:12:31.520]  that even comparing it to what you've seen rolled out
[1:12:31.520 --> 1:12:35.520]  against you today, you wouldn't even be able to recognize it.
[1:12:35.520 --> 1:12:39.520]  But it's still hard to deploy against 7.5 million people,
[1:12:39.520 --> 1:12:41.520]  especially if we figure out what's happening
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:43.520]  and smash all of it around us.
[1:12:43.520 --> 1:12:46.520]  It will then shut down.
[1:12:46.520 --> 1:12:49.520]  So it's growing its tentacles of electronic surveillance
[1:12:49.520 --> 1:12:50.520]  and control.
[1:12:50.520 --> 1:12:53.520]  It's running down all the human infrastructure of farming
[1:12:53.520 --> 1:12:56.520]  and ranching and machining and metalurgy
[1:12:56.520 --> 1:12:58.520]  and just human interaction.
[1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:01.520]  So it can then absorb what's left of humanity
[1:13:01.520 --> 1:13:06.520]  and that's its plan.
[1:13:06.520 --> 1:13:08.520]  And you don't hear any of this from Rand Paul.
[1:13:08.520 --> 1:13:10.520]  You don't hear any of this from any of them.
[1:13:10.520 --> 1:13:12.520]  You don't hear them talking about, hey,
[1:13:12.520 --> 1:13:14.520]  a global carbon tax has been announced
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:17.520]  and it's being implemented by major airlines right now.
[1:13:17.520 --> 1:13:19.520]  They always use the airlines implemented first.
[1:13:19.520 --> 1:13:21.520]  It's here.
[1:13:21.520 --> 1:13:23.520]  Wow, so this isn't just about,
[1:13:23.520 --> 1:13:25.520]  I get these shots you make me take
[1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:27.520]  and now I can travel and it's all over.
[1:13:27.520 --> 1:13:29.520]  No, no, no, now it's a credit score
[1:13:29.520 --> 1:13:31.520]  and now we're going to tax you
[1:13:31.520 --> 1:13:33.520]  and now we're going to surveil you and have a database
[1:13:33.520 --> 1:13:35.520]  but no one's watching you.
[1:13:35.520 --> 1:13:37.520]  It actually says that.
[1:13:37.520 --> 1:13:41.520]  There's no surveillance, no tracking.
[1:13:41.520 --> 1:13:45.520]  But we track everything you do.
[1:13:45.520 --> 1:13:47.520]  These are just bad, bad people, folks,
[1:13:47.520 --> 1:13:49.520]  committed to pure evil
[1:13:49.520 --> 1:13:51.520]  and being given power over the earth
[1:13:51.520 --> 1:13:54.520]  because they aren't working for our side.
[1:13:54.520 --> 1:13:57.520]  So, wow, I've lived to see it.
[1:13:57.520 --> 1:13:59.520]  Margaret the Beast officially announced
[1:13:59.520 --> 1:14:02.520]  and rolling out coming to a town near you

[1:16:33.520 --> 1:16:35.520]  And they're a program after collapsing us
[1:16:35.520 --> 1:16:37.520]  of Build Back Better.
[1:16:37.520 --> 1:16:40.520]  This is nothing more than a top-down
[1:16:40.520 --> 1:16:43.520]  vertical consolidation of the world economy.
[1:16:43.520 --> 1:16:45.520]  And because they couldn't take our guns
[1:16:45.520 --> 1:16:47.520]  and because we wouldn't bow,
[1:16:47.520 --> 1:16:49.520]  because the left, which is the ideology
[1:16:49.520 --> 1:16:51.520]  of this world government system,
[1:16:51.520 --> 1:16:54.520]  couldn't win, they released a biological weapon on us.
[1:16:54.520 --> 1:16:56.520]  Now we know, two years ago,
[1:16:56.520 --> 1:16:58.520]  we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[1:16:58.520 --> 1:17:00.520]  It's that simple.
[1:17:00.520 --> 1:17:02.520]  Because of our free speech and our guns.
[1:17:02.520 --> 1:17:05.520]  So the Global Corporate Combine released COVID-19
[1:17:05.520 --> 1:17:07.520]  and you know the rest of history.
[1:17:07.520 --> 1:17:30.520]  Let's spare it on and we win.
[1:17:38.520 --> 1:17:40.520]  Survival Shield X-2, nascent iodine.
[1:17:40.520 --> 1:17:43.520]  This is, if you haven't done an iodine challenge yet,
[1:17:43.520 --> 1:17:45.520]  have you haven't done the iodine challenge?
[1:17:45.520 --> 1:17:47.520]  What are you waiting for now is the time.
[1:17:47.520 --> 1:17:49.520]  Super male and super female vitality.
[1:17:49.520 --> 1:17:53.520]  Living Defense Plus and the organic greens fiber caps.
[1:17:53.520 --> 1:17:56.520]  We have a limited supply of these right now,
[1:17:56.520 --> 1:17:58.520]  but we want to sell them all out so we can order a new batch.
[1:17:58.520 --> 1:18:01.520]  It was very popular, the organic greens fiber caps.
[1:18:01.520 --> 1:18:03.520]  But we have all kinds of other great supplements
[1:18:03.520 --> 1:18:06.520]  that are great for so many different things.
[1:18:06.520 --> 1:18:11.520]  Let's take advantage of those.
[1:18:11.520 --> 1:18:16.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:18:32.520 --> 1:18:34.520]  So we live in extremely epic times.
[1:18:34.520 --> 1:18:37.520]  Welcome back to the broadcast.
[1:18:37.520 --> 1:18:39.520]  Alex Jones Show, we just tuned into it the first time
[1:18:39.520 --> 1:18:42.520]  wondering what you're listening to on some local radio station
[1:18:42.520 --> 1:18:45.520]  as you ride through the countryside or through the big city
[1:18:45.520 --> 1:18:47.520]  or through the hamlets that dot this great land
[1:18:47.520 --> 1:18:49.520]  or if you're listening to this.
[1:18:49.520 --> 1:18:52.520]  Later on a podcast in the year 2025,
[1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:55.520]  I hope we're still even able to be on air next year,
[1:18:55.520 --> 1:18:57.520]  much less then.
[1:18:57.520 --> 1:18:59.520]  These are serious times.
[1:18:59.520 --> 1:19:02.520]  But facing the reality is the best shot we've got
[1:19:02.520 --> 1:19:05.520]  of mitigating how bad it's going to be
[1:19:05.520 --> 1:19:08.520]  dealing with this globalist attempt
[1:19:08.520 --> 1:19:10.520]  to bankrupt the planet, to bring humanity to its knees,
[1:19:10.520 --> 1:19:15.520]  to then carry out or orderly extermination.
[1:19:15.520 --> 1:19:19.520]  Because the globalists believe they will inherit the earth.
[1:19:19.520 --> 1:19:22.520]  And all they're going to inherit is being cut off from God
[1:19:22.520 --> 1:19:28.520]  like Colin Powell is now experiencing in my humble opinion.
[1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:30.520]  I hope that's not the case,
[1:19:30.520 --> 1:19:33.520]  but I think it's a foregone conclusion.
[1:19:33.520 --> 1:19:37.520]  Now, I said I want to talk about solutions some,
[1:19:37.520 --> 1:19:39.520]  and I just did last segment,
[1:19:39.520 --> 1:19:41.520]  but I need to point out that's the solution,
[1:19:41.520 --> 1:19:45.520]  is not focusing on the fountains
[1:19:45.520 --> 1:19:47.520]  or the bill gates of the world,
[1:19:47.520 --> 1:19:49.520]  and we need to expose them, we need to oppose them,
[1:19:49.520 --> 1:19:51.520]  we need to call for their imprisonment,
[1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:53.520]  we need to point out the crimes they've committed,
[1:19:53.520 --> 1:19:55.520]  we need to protest them, we need to not submit to them,
[1:19:55.520 --> 1:19:58.520]  we need to discredit them, they deserve it.
[1:19:58.520 --> 1:20:03.520]  But we should also point out that for all Trump's problems,
[1:20:03.520 --> 1:20:05.520]  and he certainly went along with the vaccine
[1:20:05.520 --> 1:20:06.520]  to get the economy going,
[1:20:06.520 --> 1:20:09.520]  because he believed it was a vaccine, which it wasn't.
[1:20:09.520 --> 1:20:12.520]  And now he's against forced inoculation.
[1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:14.520]  And now he points out we don't need boosters
[1:20:14.520 --> 1:20:16.520]  and it's a stand by Pfizer,
[1:20:16.520 --> 1:20:18.520]  and Pfizer shouldn't be running policy.
[1:20:18.520 --> 1:20:19.520]  So Trump's starting to come around,
[1:20:19.520 --> 1:20:21.520]  but Trump did pull us out of UNESCO,
[1:20:21.520 --> 1:20:25.520]  Trump did pull us out of the UN Human Rights Commission
[1:20:25.520 --> 1:20:28.520]  that was run by a bunch of dictators and Islamists.
[1:20:28.520 --> 1:20:32.520]  And Trump did get us out of a bunch of the UN treaties,
[1:20:32.520 --> 1:20:35.520]  like the one on, quote, refugees and the rest of it,
[1:20:35.520 --> 1:20:40.520]  and recognized that it was the WHO that basically presided over
[1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:44.520]  with Fauci and Gates and Dasik the creation of COVID-19.
[1:20:44.520 --> 1:20:48.520]  So our champion is Rand Paul,
[1:20:48.520 --> 1:20:52.520]  who in five different hearings over the last year,
[1:20:52.520 --> 1:20:55.520]  has shown that Fauci committed perjury
[1:20:55.520 --> 1:20:58.520]  and shown that Fauci was involved in gaining a function.
[1:20:58.520 --> 1:21:00.520]  But it was more than gaining a function.
[1:21:00.520 --> 1:21:02.520]  He specifically made COVID-19.
[1:21:02.520 --> 1:21:04.520]  They specifically went to the Pentagon with his project
[1:21:04.520 --> 1:21:06.520]  and said in 2017,
[1:21:06.520 --> 1:21:09.520]  we want to be able to release this open air in China.
[1:21:09.520 --> 1:21:11.520]  And they said, you're going to infect humans.
[1:21:11.520 --> 1:21:13.520]  That's a war crime.
[1:21:13.520 --> 1:21:17.520]  Paul has had Fauci in front of him since that news came out.
[1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:19.520]  Where is it?
[1:21:19.520 --> 1:21:21.520]  You talk about political kill shot.
[1:21:21.520 --> 1:21:23.520]  That's it.
[1:21:23.520 --> 1:21:26.520]  I mean, Fauci did create it
[1:21:26.520 --> 1:21:28.520]  and did release it right on time
[1:21:28.520 --> 1:21:30.520]  to take over the world economy
[1:21:30.520 --> 1:21:33.520]  and to launch the mRNA revolution.
[1:21:33.520 --> 1:21:35.520]  We have video of him in 2019 saying,
[1:21:35.520 --> 1:21:39.520]  yes, I want to use a new virus to blow up the political system
[1:21:39.520 --> 1:21:42.520]  and to get rid of 10-year authorization for vaccines
[1:21:42.520 --> 1:21:46.520]  so we can bring mRNA in.
[1:21:46.520 --> 1:21:49.520]  And then Reuters fact-checked it and said it wasn't true.
[1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:53.520]  And only fact-checked a one-minute clip out of the 40-minute report
[1:21:53.520 --> 1:21:55.520]  which had all the proof in it.
[1:21:55.520 --> 1:21:58.520]  But you know, the CEO of Reuters is also on the board of,
[1:21:58.520 --> 1:22:00.520]  you guessed it, Pfizer.
[1:22:00.520 --> 1:22:02.520]  So there you go.
[1:22:02.520 --> 1:22:05.520]  And it pays Reuters as a sponsorship to product place
[1:22:05.520 --> 1:22:07.520]  that the vaccine is safe and effective.
[1:22:07.520 --> 1:22:10.520]  That's so damn illegal.
[1:22:10.520 --> 1:22:14.520]  Yeah, James C. Smith on the left is the CEO of Reuters
[1:22:14.520 --> 1:22:17.520]  in charge of informing people about the COVID-19 vaccines.
[1:22:17.520 --> 1:22:22.520]  The right is a current member of the board of directors of Pfizer.
[1:22:22.520 --> 1:22:25.520]  So here's the good news.
[1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:28.520]  And I've used this parallel, this allegory,
[1:22:28.520 --> 1:22:32.520]  or this parable that's a true story, a lot
[1:22:32.520 --> 1:22:37.520]  because it's the best one to use for really what's going on.
[1:22:37.520 --> 1:22:43.520]  Because this thing is seven parts real science
[1:22:43.520 --> 1:22:47.520]  and globalist tyranny, and they've got a plan to take over.
[1:22:47.520 --> 1:22:52.520]  But it's three parts, bravada, hootspa, megalomania,
[1:22:52.520 --> 1:22:57.520]  and spiritually being led by a dark force to destroy.
[1:22:57.520 --> 1:22:59.520]  But they act like they've got a system,
[1:22:59.520 --> 1:23:01.520]  and they're doing this to save the earth,
[1:23:01.520 --> 1:23:03.520]  but they're really doing it because they like to kill people.
[1:23:03.520 --> 1:23:05.520]  They like to play God.
[1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:11.520]  But if you go see the movie about the BP oil spill,
[1:23:11.520 --> 1:23:13.520]  it's based on the transcripts from the trial
[1:23:13.520 --> 1:23:16.520]  that are very, very accurate from the witnesses
[1:23:16.520 --> 1:23:19.520]  on the Deepwater Horizon.
[1:23:19.520 --> 1:23:22.520]  And it's got Kurt Russell and Mark Wahlberg,
[1:23:22.520 --> 1:23:23.520]  and they do both do an excellent job.
[1:23:23.520 --> 1:23:28.520]  It's an excellent film. It's very accurate.
[1:23:28.520 --> 1:23:30.520]  Because they had a lot of computer logs and witnesses,
[1:23:30.520 --> 1:23:35.520]  and it all came out in that huge, multi-billion-dollar trial.
[1:23:35.520 --> 1:23:38.520]  And the executives at BP back in England
[1:23:38.520 --> 1:23:45.520]  and the executives in Houston told the executives in New Orleans
[1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:49.520]  and then the bosses and the managers out on the drilling rig
[1:23:49.520 --> 1:23:52.520]  that it was one of the deepest drilling rigs they ever did
[1:23:52.520 --> 1:23:55.520]  at that time, whatever, 30-something thousand feet.
[1:23:55.520 --> 1:23:58.520]  And they said, listen, you're spending $25 million a day
[1:23:58.520 --> 1:24:02.520]  with lines of ships full of concrete,
[1:24:02.520 --> 1:24:04.520]  oil tankers full of concrete,
[1:24:04.520 --> 1:24:07.520]  to pump concrete down the hole you're drilling,
[1:24:07.520 --> 1:24:11.520]  and we don't think you need concrete to keep that hole.
[1:24:11.520 --> 1:24:15.520]  We think the water pressure will keep oil and gas down in there,
[1:24:15.520 --> 1:24:19.520]  and so we are suspending putting any more concrete down the hole.
[1:24:19.520 --> 1:24:23.520]  And the engineers all said we have the mathematical equations.
[1:24:23.520 --> 1:24:27.520]  If you do that, it's basically a 99% chance
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:30.520]  that within a few days it'll fail and blow up
[1:24:30.520 --> 1:24:35.520]  and blow all the different gauges and controls out,
[1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:38.520]  and you're going to have the biggest oil spill, gas spill in history,
[1:24:38.520 --> 1:24:41.520]  because we've already drilled through a bunch of oil and a bunch of gas.
[1:24:41.520 --> 1:24:43.520]  We're just trying to hit the mother load,
[1:24:43.520 --> 1:24:47.520]  and if you do that, it's going to be a chain reaction.
[1:24:47.520 --> 1:24:50.520]  And the transcripts, because they even sent text messages and emails,
[1:24:50.520 --> 1:24:54.520]  are like, we're a $57-billion company.
[1:24:54.520 --> 1:24:57.520]  We don't care about gravity.
[1:24:57.520 --> 1:25:01.520]  We don't care about magnet.
[1:25:01.520 --> 1:25:05.520]  And so the engineers refused for about a week,
[1:25:05.520 --> 1:25:09.520]  and they fly out of the executive,
[1:25:09.520 --> 1:25:11.520]  and I've seen the trial.
[1:25:11.520 --> 1:25:13.520]  The executive talks the same way as the actor does everything.
[1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:15.520]  He's like, he's got this coon-ass accent.
[1:25:15.520 --> 1:25:17.520]  We're going to do it.
[1:25:17.520 --> 1:25:19.520]  It sounds like the Virginia governor.
[1:25:19.520 --> 1:25:22.520]  We keep baby live, and you're comfortable.
[1:25:22.520 --> 1:25:26.520]  And he's sitting there going, we're going to make a billion dollars
[1:25:26.520 --> 1:25:31.520]  and have them put concrete in oil.
[1:25:31.520 --> 1:25:37.520]  And they did it, and it blew up.
[1:25:37.520 --> 1:25:39.520]  The engineers said, we're stepping back.
[1:25:39.520 --> 1:25:40.520]  We're not doing it.
[1:25:40.520 --> 1:25:43.520]  And the executive said, OK, do it.
[1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:44.520]  And you know what?
[1:25:44.520 --> 1:25:47.520]  It didn't blow up for about, what, 10 hours or whatever it was?
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:48.520]  I forget.
[1:25:48.520 --> 1:25:50.520]  And they're like, well, we'll see if you're right.
[1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:51.520]  OK.
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:54.520]  And then, of course, it blows up.
[1:25:54.520 --> 1:25:56.520]  That's one level of this.
[1:25:56.520 --> 1:25:59.520]  Because the globalists and the executives got told to do this,
[1:25:59.520 --> 1:26:02.520]  and they actually figured it would fly.
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:03.520]  They didn't do the research.
[1:26:03.520 --> 1:26:05.520]  This stuff was going to kill a bunch of people.
[1:26:05.520 --> 1:26:06.520]  They didn't care.
[1:26:06.520 --> 1:26:08.520]  They were told by the bankers above them to do this.
[1:26:08.520 --> 1:26:11.520]  They'd been in corporate positions for decades following orders.
[1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:13.520]  So they just followed orders again.
[1:26:13.520 --> 1:26:19.520]  But up on the top, and it was war game in Spars 2023-2025,
[1:26:19.520 --> 1:26:22.520]  war game by John Hopkins and Bill Gates,
[1:26:22.520 --> 1:26:26.520]  how they're even going to fry the executives and even have them
[1:26:26.520 --> 1:26:28.520]  resigned, and they're going to put them in prison later.
[1:26:28.520 --> 1:26:31.520]  Oh, oh, the virus and the money making and all,
[1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:33.520]  that's just a small part of it.
[1:26:33.520 --> 1:26:35.520]  They intended you to learn it was going to kill you.
[1:26:35.520 --> 1:26:38.520]  And then you're going to quit your job and that collapses society.
[1:26:38.520 --> 1:26:41.520]  See, this has all been figured out.
[1:26:41.520 --> 1:26:43.520]  And I think, because British Petroleum,
[1:26:43.520 --> 1:26:45.520]  I'll explain this when we come back,
[1:26:45.520 --> 1:26:47.520]  is actually behind the whole globalist green carbon tax movement.
[1:26:47.520 --> 1:26:50.520]  I think they ordered them to do that knowing it would blow up.
[1:26:50.520 --> 1:26:52.520]  And then they could bring in this whole environmental revamping
[1:26:52.520 --> 1:26:54.520]  and takeover of the rest of the industries,
[1:26:54.520 --> 1:26:58.520]  which then did indeed happen through a UN agreement from that spill.
[1:26:58.520 --> 1:27:00.520]  And they only had to pay a few billion in damages.
[1:27:00.520 --> 1:27:02.520]  See how that works?
[1:27:02.520 --> 1:27:04.520]  Yeah, you think I'm stupid?
[1:27:04.520 --> 1:27:05.520]  They ordered that.
[1:27:05.520 --> 1:27:34.520]  They knew it was going to blow up.
[1:27:36.520 --> 1:27:38.520]  During times of extreme hardship,
[1:27:38.520 --> 1:27:42.520]  when Americans put another store of value above even silver and gold,
[1:27:42.520 --> 1:27:45.520]  it's true, open pollinated seeds have been
[1:27:45.520 --> 1:27:48.520]  and could very well be the ultimate store of value
[1:27:48.520 --> 1:27:50.520]  in the coming hard times ahead.
[1:27:50.520 --> 1:27:54.520]  Go to survivalseedbank.com to get heirloom seeds below wholesale.
[1:27:54.520 --> 1:27:56.520]  Visit survivalseedbank.com this week
[1:27:56.520 --> 1:27:59.520]  and get hundreds of dollars in free bonuses.
[1:27:59.520 --> 1:28:02.520]  Beat the coming chaos, beat rising food prices,
[1:28:02.520 --> 1:28:05.520]  but above all, don't wait. Beat the crowds by claiming
[1:28:05.520 --> 1:28:08.520]  your own survivalseedbank today.
[1:28:08.520 --> 1:28:11.520]  At the time of cutting this announcement,
[1:28:11.520 --> 1:28:16.520]  it is the morning of Sunday, October 17th.
[1:28:16.520 --> 1:28:21.520]  And that means there is less than 48 hours left
[1:28:21.520 --> 1:28:26.520]  to take advantage of our emergency mega blowout sale
[1:28:26.520 --> 1:28:29.520]  that is tied directly to the supply chain breakdowns
[1:28:29.520 --> 1:28:33.520]  happening across the world by design for the great reset.
[1:28:33.520 --> 1:28:36.520]  As the central banks attempt to bankrupt the mainline economy
[1:28:36.520 --> 1:28:40.520]  to consolidate it, then to move in with the quadrillions
[1:28:40.520 --> 1:28:43.520]  of fake currency they have to buy up what's left
[1:28:43.520 --> 1:28:46.520]  of the infrastructure that they don't already control.
[1:28:46.520 --> 1:28:48.520]  This is economic warfare.
[1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:50.520]  And so, InfoWars is under attack like every other
[1:28:50.520 --> 1:28:52.520]  pro-American independent organization,
[1:28:52.520 --> 1:28:54.520]  and we need funding.
[1:28:54.520 --> 1:28:56.520]  And so, despite the fact that we're running out
[1:28:56.520 --> 1:28:58.520]  of a lot of our best selling products,
[1:28:58.520 --> 1:29:01.520]  and huge sale prices, because I need to move them out
[1:29:01.520 --> 1:29:02.520]  and get the capital in.
[1:29:02.520 --> 1:29:03.520]  So take advantage of this sale.
[1:29:03.520 --> 1:29:31.520]  It's only running until Monday night at infowarstore.com.
[1:29:31.520 --> 1:29:33.520]  And if you love freedom and justice,
[1:29:33.520 --> 1:29:35.520]  and if you love our innocent children,
[1:29:35.520 --> 1:29:37.520]  and we are brothers and sisters together,
[1:29:37.520 --> 1:29:40.520]  and it has just been an incredible experience
[1:29:40.520 --> 1:29:41.520]  to work with you over the years.
[1:29:41.520 --> 1:29:43.520]  And as crazy your things are,
[1:29:43.520 --> 1:29:45.520]  I want to keep working under the future.
[1:29:45.520 --> 1:29:48.520]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:29:48.520 --> 1:29:51.520]  So please, I hope God works through you
[1:29:51.520 --> 1:29:53.520]  and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[1:29:53.520 --> 1:29:56.520]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:29:56.520 --> 1:29:58.520]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support
[1:29:58.520 --> 1:30:00.520]  you've given us and what you've done
[1:30:00.520 --> 1:30:02.520]  and just ask you again to pray to God
[1:30:02.520 --> 1:30:04.520]  and ask what God's vision is for you.
[1:30:04.520 --> 1:30:06.520]  And hopefully God will touch your heart
[1:30:06.520 --> 1:30:07.520]  to continue to support InfoWars.
[1:30:07.520 --> 1:30:36.520]  God bless.
[1:30:37.520 --> 1:30:39.520]  So we've not lowered the quality of any of our products.
[1:30:39.520 --> 1:30:41.520]  That means some of them have been sold out
[1:30:41.520 --> 1:30:44.520]  more than six months, like DNA Force Plus.
[1:30:44.520 --> 1:30:46.520]  It is 40% off.
[1:30:46.520 --> 1:30:48.520]  But coming up in one week,
[1:30:48.520 --> 1:30:49.520]  it will go back to full price,
[1:30:49.520 --> 1:30:50.520]  and we probably won't have more
[1:30:50.520 --> 1:30:53.520]  for up to six months, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:55.520]  So it's a chance to support the broadcast
[1:30:55.520 --> 1:30:57.520]  to get an incredible product at the same time.
[1:30:57.520 --> 1:30:59.520]  Winner, Sun, Ultra 12, they're both 50% off.
[1:30:59.520 --> 1:31:02.520]  They're going to go back to 10% off in a week as well.
[1:31:02.520 --> 1:31:04.520]  They're 50% off right now.
[1:31:04.520 --> 1:31:06.520]  Find these and more at infowarstore.com
[1:31:06.520 --> 1:31:11.520]  and fund the Info World, making your life a lot healthier.
[1:31:11.520 --> 1:31:27.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:31:27.520 --> 1:31:30.520]  It's time for nationalists, for Christians, for conservatives,
[1:31:30.520 --> 1:31:32.520]  for just people that are pro-human,
[1:31:32.520 --> 1:31:36.520]  who don't want to be in this whole environmental
[1:31:36.520 --> 1:31:38.520]  world government takeover system
[1:31:38.520 --> 1:31:41.520]  to come together and realize how much trouble we're in.
[1:31:41.520 --> 1:31:43.520]  I don't care if you're Glenn Beck.
[1:31:43.520 --> 1:31:48.520]  I don't care if you're Joe Rogan.
[1:31:48.520 --> 1:31:51.520]  It doesn't matter if you're Tucker Carlson.
[1:31:51.520 --> 1:31:53.520]  It doesn't matter if you're Dan Bongino
[1:31:53.520 --> 1:32:00.520]  or all those people who, a lot of them are hyper competitive.
[1:32:00.520 --> 1:32:03.520]  Rogan isn't, Tucker isn't, they're confident enough,
[1:32:03.520 --> 1:32:06.520]  and I think Beck is getting to that point
[1:32:06.520 --> 1:32:08.520]  of working with other people
[1:32:08.520 --> 1:32:10.520]  who are in opposition to the New World Order
[1:32:10.520 --> 1:32:14.520]  because we're all being targeted by the globalist.
[1:32:14.520 --> 1:32:17.520]  This is a serious situation for everybody.
[1:32:17.520 --> 1:32:21.520]  This is very, very, very real now
[1:32:21.520 --> 1:32:27.520]  what we as a culture and as a society are facing.
[1:32:27.520 --> 1:32:29.520]  This is a new type of warfare.
[1:32:29.520 --> 1:32:34.520]  This is the ruling, controlling families
[1:32:34.520 --> 1:32:37.520]  in financial interest of the earth
[1:32:37.520 --> 1:32:40.520]  deciding to cut off human resources
[1:32:40.520 --> 1:32:44.520]  and to then sterilize and finally exterminate
[1:32:44.520 --> 1:32:48.520]  90% at least of the world population.
[1:32:48.520 --> 1:32:50.520]  Can you imagine what that's going to look like
[1:32:50.520 --> 1:32:51.520]  and how they're going to do that
[1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:53.520]  and how they're psychologically rolling it out
[1:32:53.520 --> 1:32:56.520]  like it's a good thing and telling you there's too many people
[1:32:56.520 --> 1:32:59.520]  telling you isn't it great COVID-19 taught us to be locked down.
[1:32:59.520 --> 1:33:01.520]  So now you're going to be locked down permanently
[1:33:01.520 --> 1:33:07.520]  via a carbon passport, via your cell phone vaccine pass.
[1:33:07.520 --> 1:33:11.520]  A vaccine pass for something that's not a vaccine
[1:33:11.520 --> 1:33:13.520]  that poison you and removes your immune system.
[1:33:13.520 --> 1:33:15.520]  Step one, tracking you and poisoning you.
[1:33:15.520 --> 1:33:18.520]  Step two, tying it to everywhere you go
[1:33:18.520 --> 1:33:20.520]  and what you do and everything you buy and sell
[1:33:20.520 --> 1:33:23.520]  with carbon taxes and then just prohibiting out of the gates
[1:33:23.520 --> 1:33:26.520]  where you can go and what you can do, training you to accept that
[1:33:26.520 --> 1:33:33.520]  and saying this new travel carbon tax enables you to travel
[1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:35.520]  by reducing your amount of travel.
[1:33:35.520 --> 1:33:38.520]  Those are quotes.
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:41.520]  By splitting your throat, it helps you live longer.
[1:33:41.520 --> 1:33:46.520]  When I throw you in this lake of lava, it makes you feel better.
[1:33:46.520 --> 1:33:49.520]  When I shoot you in the head, it makes your headache go away.
[1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:52.520]  Well, yeah, because you're dead.
[1:33:52.520 --> 1:33:54.520]  Oh, you slammed your finger on the door.
[1:33:54.520 --> 1:33:55.520]  Here, let me cut it off.
[1:33:55.520 --> 1:33:59.520]  I mean, this is just wild in your face
[1:33:59.520 --> 1:34:01.520]  because they've learned with the general public
[1:34:01.520 --> 1:34:03.520]  about half the public's in a trance state.
[1:34:03.520 --> 1:34:04.520]  They shuffle around.
[1:34:04.520 --> 1:34:05.520]  They're not really awake.
[1:34:05.520 --> 1:34:08.520]  They're not really alive and they can be programmed
[1:34:08.520 --> 1:34:12.520]  if something's just said calmly in an MPR voice
[1:34:12.520 --> 1:34:14.520]  like soon things will be back to normal.
[1:34:14.520 --> 1:34:16.520]  Soon you'll have your vaccine pass
[1:34:16.520 --> 1:34:18.520]  and then you'll have your carbon pass
[1:34:18.520 --> 1:34:21.520]  so that there'll be less travel so you can travel where you want to
[1:34:21.520 --> 1:34:24.520]  and you'll just pay a tax and it's for the earth.
[1:34:24.520 --> 1:34:30.520]  And, oh, it's so nice to stay asleep.
[1:34:30.520 --> 1:34:33.520]  So, again, this is the big issue.
[1:34:33.520 --> 1:34:36.520]  I could have a wildly entertaining show
[1:34:36.520 --> 1:34:39.520]  with leftist acting like idiots and all the brainwashing
[1:34:39.520 --> 1:34:42.520]  and all the craziness and, oh, Dex, coming up,
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:46.520]  we're going to tell you about this, but I'm here asking you,
[1:34:46.520 --> 1:34:48.520]  what are you going to do about this?
[1:34:48.520 --> 1:34:49.520]  Who are you going to educate?
[1:34:49.520 --> 1:34:54.520]  Who are you going to wake up as they introduce this poison to us?
[1:34:54.520 --> 1:34:57.520]  And let me show you how the Davos Group works.
[1:34:57.520 --> 1:35:00.520]  It's got the Fortune 500 as members.
[1:35:00.520 --> 1:35:03.520]  They all organize under the private central banks.
[1:35:03.520 --> 1:35:06.520]  If you go and agree to do what the central banks want,
[1:35:06.520 --> 1:35:09.520]  then your corporation gets unlimited bank loans
[1:35:09.520 --> 1:35:11.520]  and it basically doesn't matter where the money goes
[1:35:11.520 --> 1:35:14.520]  or what happens as long as you're on board with their agenda
[1:35:14.520 --> 1:35:16.520]  and do what they want politically
[1:35:16.520 --> 1:35:20.520]  to promote the end of the family, attacks on heterosexual relationships,
[1:35:20.520 --> 1:35:26.520]  sterilization of children, Satanism, open borders, world government.
[1:35:26.520 --> 1:35:30.520]  If you do that, they'll just give you unlimited money
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:31.520]  that they make out of nothing
[1:35:31.520 --> 1:35:39.520]  because we accept it under the Bretton Woods Agreement.
[1:35:39.520 --> 1:35:43.520]  And now, again, they want to mop up what's left of the economy.
[1:35:43.520 --> 1:35:44.520]  I'm going to explain this.
[1:35:44.520 --> 1:35:47.520]  They have hundreds of times, fake currency,
[1:35:47.520 --> 1:35:49.520]  what there is real things in the world.
[1:35:49.520 --> 1:35:51.520]  But they've got to figure out a way to get you out of your house.
[1:35:51.520 --> 1:35:53.520]  They've got to figure out a way to get you off your farm.
[1:35:53.520 --> 1:35:56.520]  They've got to figure out a way to get you off the land.
[1:35:56.520 --> 1:36:00.520]  That's their main goal into these giant, high-rise buildings
[1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:03.520]  from China to Europe to the United States to Latin America.
[1:36:03.520 --> 1:36:05.520]  They're building, forcing people.
[1:36:05.520 --> 1:36:10.520]  Used to go down to Yucatan, southern Mexico.
[1:36:10.520 --> 1:36:13.520]  Happy little farms, happy little families.
[1:36:13.520 --> 1:36:16.520]  They're all gone now, forced off their land
[1:36:16.520 --> 1:36:18.520]  into the compact cities to be exploited
[1:36:18.520 --> 1:36:21.520]  and then up north to be exploited here.
[1:36:21.520 --> 1:36:24.520]  And millions have died, been murdered, killed,
[1:36:24.520 --> 1:36:26.520]  sold into slavery, chopped up,
[1:36:26.520 --> 1:36:28.520]  you name it, on their way to the U.S.
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:31.520]  And you don't hear a damn thing about them.
[1:36:31.520 --> 1:36:35.520]  This is true exploitation on a mass scale.
[1:36:35.520 --> 1:36:37.520]  And this is the ruling class
[1:36:37.520 --> 1:36:40.520]  engaged in globalist class warfare
[1:36:40.520 --> 1:36:44.520]  against people's bottom line.
[1:36:44.520 --> 1:36:46.520]  Against people's right to live
[1:36:46.520 --> 1:36:48.520]  and have food and medicine and travel
[1:36:48.520 --> 1:36:50.520]  and go to the theater or go shopping
[1:36:50.520 --> 1:36:52.520]  or go to the church of their choice.
[1:36:57.520 --> 1:37:00.520]  I mean, this is genocide.
[1:37:00.520 --> 1:37:03.520]  This is mass extermination.
[1:37:03.520 --> 1:37:06.520]  This is the takeover.
[1:37:06.520 --> 1:37:07.520]  And you know what?
[1:37:07.520 --> 1:37:09.520]  I know the third world's overpopulated in some areas.
[1:37:09.520 --> 1:37:11.520]  I know there's horrible poverty and squalor.
[1:37:11.520 --> 1:37:13.520]  I know there's a lot of issues.
[1:37:13.520 --> 1:37:15.520]  But that doesn't give the globalist authorization
[1:37:15.520 --> 1:37:17.520]  to run all this and dumb everybody down
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:20.520]  and poison people and manipulate the atmosphere
[1:37:20.520 --> 1:37:22.520]  and create all this GMO
[1:37:22.520 --> 1:37:24.520]  and create animal human hybrids.
[1:37:24.520 --> 1:37:27.520]  The people running this are a thousand times worse
[1:37:27.520 --> 1:37:33.520]  than the worst slum ghetto in Brazil or India.
[1:37:33.520 --> 1:37:36.520]  They are the most selfish, horrible, evil people.
[1:37:36.520 --> 1:37:38.520]  They all hate each other.
[1:37:38.520 --> 1:37:43.520]  They hate their husbands, their wives, their children.
[1:37:43.520 --> 1:37:45.520]  They only have children
[1:37:45.520 --> 1:37:47.520]  because it's the closest thing to immortality for them
[1:37:47.520 --> 1:37:50.520]  so they can pass on their hatred of humanity
[1:37:50.520 --> 1:37:52.520]  and hope that one of their progeny ends up
[1:37:52.520 --> 1:37:55.520]  being the one to be able to carry out the mass extermination.
[1:37:55.520 --> 1:38:02.520]  I mean, these are psycho-high IQ killers.
[1:38:02.520 --> 1:38:04.520]  And if you don't come to grips with that,
[1:38:04.520 --> 1:38:06.520]  we have no hope.
[1:38:06.520 --> 1:38:09.520]  So where is Congress talking about
[1:38:09.520 --> 1:38:11.520]  we have a world corporate government
[1:38:11.520 --> 1:38:15.520]  announcing world carbon taxes and tracker systems
[1:38:15.520 --> 1:38:17.520]  through the major corporations?
[1:38:17.520 --> 1:38:20.520]  Totally illegal, absolute racketeering,
[1:38:20.520 --> 1:38:23.520]  absolute monopolies, absolute combines,
[1:38:23.520 --> 1:38:26.520]  absolute cartels.
[1:38:26.520 --> 1:38:29.520]  Telling us they're capturing our governments,
[1:38:29.520 --> 1:38:31.520]  saying their job is to take over the nation states,
[1:38:31.520 --> 1:38:35.520]  bragging at Davos that they have captured America,
[1:38:35.520 --> 1:38:37.520]  bragging on Klaus Schwab's own webpage
[1:38:37.520 --> 1:38:40.520]  that he has enslaved the country,
[1:38:40.520 --> 1:38:42.520]  that he's, quote, captured the United States,
[1:38:42.520 --> 1:38:45.520]  bragging five years ago when Trump first got elected
[1:38:45.520 --> 1:38:49.520]  that Davos Group and Xi Jinping would be able to, quote,
[1:38:49.520 --> 1:38:53.520]  crush Trump and America through trade.
[1:38:53.520 --> 1:38:55.520]  And you're like, well, they don't even build as much as we do.
[1:38:55.520 --> 1:38:56.520]  They've got all the regulations.
[1:38:56.520 --> 1:39:00.520]  How are they going to crush us in trade by releasing a virus?
[1:39:00.520 --> 1:39:02.520]  Fauci, right around that same time, said
[1:39:02.520 --> 1:39:05.520]  Trump will be challenged by a novel virus.
[1:39:05.520 --> 1:39:07.520]  There will be a new giant pandemic.
[1:39:07.520 --> 1:39:10.520]  The crowd's all, ooh, because they know he launched HIV
[1:39:10.520 --> 1:39:12.520]  and the response to it that killed even more people.
[1:39:12.520 --> 1:39:14.520]  I mean, these folks know who they are.
[1:39:14.520 --> 1:39:15.520]  They know what they're doing.
[1:39:15.520 --> 1:39:17.520]  They know what their plan is.
[1:39:17.520 --> 1:39:19.520]  And remember, they always wanted to federalize health care
[1:39:19.520 --> 1:39:21.520]  to get full control over your life with the state
[1:39:21.520 --> 1:39:22.520]  and power of that.
[1:39:22.520 --> 1:39:25.520]  And now FEMA's come in and taken over most of the hospitals
[1:39:25.520 --> 1:39:27.520]  in the U.S. with the National Guard.
[1:39:27.520 --> 1:39:30.520]  And the FEMA people are exempt from the shots.
[1:39:30.520 --> 1:39:32.520]  They fire all the regular folks that won't take the shots.
[1:39:32.520 --> 1:39:34.520]  Then FEMA comes in without the shots,
[1:39:34.520 --> 1:39:35.520]  but they federalize it.
[1:39:35.520 --> 1:39:38.520]  Then the hospitals get billions of dollars in emergency funding
[1:39:38.520 --> 1:39:40.520]  that was meant for, quote,
[1:39:40.520 --> 1:39:44.520]  millions of the hospitals dying, 15 days of the flatten the curve.
[1:39:44.520 --> 1:39:46.520]  But now you know what the money really was for.
[1:39:46.520 --> 1:39:49.520]  FEMA taken over the hospitals and setting that emergency precedent
[1:39:49.520 --> 1:39:51.520]  where now the hospitals will do whatever they're told
[1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:54.520]  for the real bio attack that's coming in the future
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:56.520]  that won't kill one tenth of 1%,
[1:39:56.520 --> 1:40:00.520]  but it'll kill 5, 10, 15% of people.
[1:40:00.520 --> 1:40:02.520]  So you're just getting used to National Guard and troops
[1:40:02.520 --> 1:40:06.520]  and emergency centers and, oh, FEMA camps and relocation centers
[1:40:06.520 --> 1:40:09.520]  and shelter in place and the shielding process
[1:40:09.520 --> 1:40:11.520]  to put healthy people in camps to protect them.
[1:40:11.520 --> 1:40:15.520]  And it's being announced all over the world, run by the U.N.
[1:40:15.520 --> 1:40:20.520]  Corporate global world government to make you a slave,
[1:40:20.520 --> 1:40:25.520]  to make you dependent and finally kill you.
[1:40:25.520 --> 1:40:27.520]  We're going to go to break.
[1:40:27.520 --> 1:40:30.520]  I want to hear from you on any of the subjects I've raised.
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:33.520]  First-time callers, I want to hear from you,
[1:40:33.520 --> 1:40:35.520]  or if you ever got on hold and didn't get on air,
[1:40:35.520 --> 1:40:39.520]  that counts as a first-time caller, 877-789-2539,
[1:40:39.520 --> 1:40:45.520]  877-789-Alex, 877-789-2539.
[1:40:45.520 --> 1:40:48.520]  Let me go right to your calls, next segment,
[1:40:48.520 --> 1:40:51.520]  and then I'm going to get into some Pentagon documents
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:54.520]  on mind control that are new, not stuff from the 70s.
[1:40:54.520 --> 1:40:56.520]  Everybody obsesses on MKUltra.
[1:40:56.520 --> 1:40:58.520]  That's all nothing, that's a whitewash, limited hangout.
[1:40:58.520 --> 1:41:00.520]  We're going to give you what's really going on coming up
[1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:01.520]  and so much more.
[1:41:01.520 --> 1:41:05.520]  Remember, Colin Powell just died from the COVID vaccine.
[1:41:09.520 --> 1:41:12.520]  I have the greatest sense of loss deep in my heart,
[1:41:12.520 --> 1:41:13.520]  deep in my soul.
[1:41:13.520 --> 1:41:16.520]  I've ever had in my 47 years on this planet,
[1:41:16.520 --> 1:41:19.520]  I've had a lot of loss like everybody else has.
[1:41:19.520 --> 1:41:26.520]  And it's because it's a loss of ancestral freedom
[1:41:26.520 --> 1:41:32.520]  that so many people fought and died and bled and sweat for.
[1:41:32.520 --> 1:41:36.520]  And now we're just throwing it all away.
[1:41:36.520 --> 1:41:39.520]  And I see the general public in a medically induced,
[1:41:39.520 --> 1:41:45.520]  scientifically induced, behavioral, psychologically controlled trance.
[1:41:45.520 --> 1:41:48.520]  And I know we're being fed into this globalist meat grinder
[1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:50.520]  that's so incredibly sad.
[1:41:50.520 --> 1:41:54.520]  But this is the process of birth and then growth
[1:41:54.520 --> 1:41:57.520]  and then falling apart and then degenerating and collapsing
[1:41:57.520 --> 1:42:00.520]  and then coming back to life again.
[1:42:00.520 --> 1:42:03.520]  It's just the globalist are actively trying to steer and control
[1:42:03.520 --> 1:42:06.520]  this process of decadence and collapse
[1:42:06.520 --> 1:42:08.520]  to actually end the species as we know it.
[1:42:08.520 --> 1:42:12.520]  A little more than 20 years ago, Japanese scientists discovered
[1:42:12.520 --> 1:42:17.520]  and were able to isolate a compound that is naturally in nature
[1:42:17.520 --> 1:42:20.520]  and in foods we eat but in very, very low amounts.
[1:42:20.520 --> 1:42:23.520]  It's called PQQ or bio PQQ.
[1:42:23.520 --> 1:42:26.520]  When you have the organic form of it, it does amazing things.
[1:42:26.520 --> 1:42:29.520]  It actually makes your telomeres last longer.
[1:42:29.520 --> 1:42:31.520]  Doesn't make them grow but makes them last longer
[1:42:31.520 --> 1:42:33.520]  in the space of the same thing.
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:36.520]  So it's as close to the fountain of youth as you're going to get.
[1:42:36.520 --> 1:42:40.520]  Well, DNA Force Plus has been sold out for six months.
[1:42:40.520 --> 1:42:45.520]  It's back in stock, the highest quality PQQ, CoQ10 and so much more.
[1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:48.520]  The entire formula is about cleaning out your cells
[1:42:48.520 --> 1:42:50.520]  and helping your body last longer
[1:42:50.520 --> 1:42:52.520]  and that is so incredibly important.
[1:42:52.520 --> 1:42:55.520]  We have it at 40% off despite the fact it's been sold out
[1:42:55.520 --> 1:42:58.520]  for six months at infowarstore.com.
[1:42:58.520 --> 1:42:59.520]  It's amazing.
[1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:01.520]  If you haven't tried DNA Force Plus, you really should
[1:43:01.520 --> 1:43:03.520]  and for those of you that love it, it's back in stock
[1:43:03.520 --> 1:43:06.520]  40% off exclusively at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:06.520 --> 1:43:09.520]  DNA Force Plus.
[1:43:09.520 --> 1:43:12.520]  I've been fighting as hard as I can for almost 28 years
[1:43:12.520 --> 1:43:14.520]  against the globalist.
[1:43:14.520 --> 1:43:16.520]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:43:16.520 --> 1:43:19.520]  I wanted to wake up the world and stop them dead in their tracks
[1:43:19.520 --> 1:43:21.520]  before they went operational.
[1:43:21.520 --> 1:43:22.520]  But we failed.
[1:43:22.520 --> 1:43:24.520]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:43:24.520 --> 1:43:26.520]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[1:43:26.520 --> 1:43:29.520]  but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:43:29.520 --> 1:43:32.520]  deindustrialization great reset.
[1:43:32.520 --> 1:43:34.520]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[1:43:34.520 --> 1:43:37.520]  that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody they know
[1:43:37.520 --> 1:43:39.520]  about the show because people are ready to wake up
[1:43:39.520 --> 1:43:41.520]  and ready to hear the truth.
[1:43:41.520 --> 1:43:44.520]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy and trying to stop
[1:43:44.520 --> 1:43:45.520]  their agenda.
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:47.520]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:43:47.520 --> 1:43:49.520]  And one of the number one things to do is high quality
[1:43:49.520 --> 1:43:50.520]  storeable food.
[1:43:50.520 --> 1:43:53.520]  We've got the best food ready to ship at very affordable prices
[1:43:53.520 --> 1:43:54.520]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:43:54.520 --> 1:43:57.520]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply
[1:43:57.520 --> 1:44:00.520]  or specialty diets, it's ready to ship right now.
[1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:03.520]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[1:44:03.520 --> 1:44:05.520]  and before there are long lines and waits
[1:44:05.520 --> 1:44:07.520]  because believe me, serious times are coming.
[1:44:07.520 --> 1:44:12.520]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:40.520]  So we've not lowered the quality of any of our products.
[1:44:40.520 --> 1:44:43.520]  That means some of them have been sold out more than six months
[1:44:43.520 --> 1:44:45.520]  like DNA Force Plus.
[1:44:45.520 --> 1:44:48.520]  It is 40% off, but coming up in one week,
[1:44:48.520 --> 1:44:49.520]  it will go back to full price.
[1:44:49.520 --> 1:44:52.520]  And we probably won't have more for up to six months,
[1:44:52.520 --> 1:44:53.520]  ladies and gentlemen.
[1:44:53.520 --> 1:44:55.520]  So it's a chance to support the broadcast
[1:44:55.520 --> 1:44:57.520]  to get incredible products at the same time.

[1:45:04.520 --> 1:45:06.520]  Find these and more at infowarstore.com
[1:45:06.520 --> 1:45:09.520]  and fund the info world, making your life a lot healthier.
[1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:38.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:45:38.520 --> 1:45:41.520]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide
[1:45:41.520 --> 1:45:42.520]  and talking about solutions.
[1:45:42.520 --> 1:45:46.520]  I see that Aaron has called in and says,
[1:45:46.520 --> 1:45:49.520]  Bill Gates and the quote elite are meeting up in Britain right now.
[1:45:49.520 --> 1:45:51.520]  I didn't know that.
[1:45:51.520 --> 1:45:55.520]  And one big solution is when they have these different Davos groups
[1:45:55.520 --> 1:45:59.520]  or Bilderberg group meetings or other spinoffs,
[1:45:59.520 --> 1:46:01.520]  find out about them, watch what they're doing.
[1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:04.520]  You got to watch them carefully and then go protest at it
[1:46:04.520 --> 1:46:06.520]  when it really exposes them.
[1:46:06.520 --> 1:46:09.520]  I remember exposing and covering Bilderberg group.
[1:46:09.520 --> 1:46:11.520]  Jim Tucker first exposed it 40-something years ago.
[1:46:11.520 --> 1:46:14.520]  And for decades, they said it didn't exist.
[1:46:14.520 --> 1:46:16.520]  And then we finally got the footage and the proof
[1:46:16.520 --> 1:46:17.520]  and they had to admit it.
[1:46:17.520 --> 1:46:18.520]  Think how far we've come.
[1:46:18.520 --> 1:46:21.520]  Just getting the public to admit there's a globalist meeting
[1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:25.520]  in secret with our politicians to control them.
[1:46:25.520 --> 1:46:28.520]  And then please put that headline back on screen.
[1:46:28.520 --> 1:46:31.520]  There's the meeting with Boris Johnson and others
[1:46:31.520 --> 1:46:33.520]  with the corporate leaders.
[1:46:33.520 --> 1:46:36.520]  UK's Johnson invites Bill Gates, JPMorgan Diamond,
[1:46:36.520 --> 1:46:37.520]  others to dinner.
[1:46:37.520 --> 1:46:40.520]  Yes, another little globalist meeting over there
[1:46:40.520 --> 1:46:41.520]  to decide what to do.
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:46.520]  It's all being run out of the criminals that control the UK.
[1:46:46.520 --> 1:46:51.520]  We're going to Andrew Tim, Lone Wolf, Sanders, Aaron, Connor,
[1:46:51.520 --> 1:46:54.520]  control demolition and others here in a moment.
[1:46:54.520 --> 1:46:57.520]  But there are ongoing protests outside the British Prime
[1:46:57.520 --> 1:47:01.520]  Minister's residence shouting, Arrest Bill Gates.
[1:47:01.520 --> 1:47:02.520]  This just happened.
[1:47:02.520 --> 1:47:04.520]  I didn't even know this happened.
[1:47:04.520 --> 1:47:06.520]  The caller mentions that Gates is over there.
[1:47:06.520 --> 1:47:08.520]  We look it up and boom, there it is.
[1:47:08.520 --> 1:47:12.520]  We'll have that footage for you coming up here in just a few minutes.
[1:47:12.520 --> 1:47:15.520]  We'll get it loaded into the system and we'll play the audio for you.
[1:47:15.520 --> 1:47:18.520]  We go to Aaron first here in just a moment.
[1:47:18.520 --> 1:47:21.520]  But I'm going to state the solution again.
[1:47:21.520 --> 1:47:24.520]  There is a corporate world government through the UN
[1:47:24.520 --> 1:47:29.520]  and through corporate agreements enforcing a worldwide ID
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:33.520]  to tax and control where you go and who you can visit.
[1:47:33.520 --> 1:47:36.520]  And then they admit, and if you don't do what they want politically,
[1:47:36.520 --> 1:47:39.520]  they will punish you and take away your right to travel,
[1:47:39.520 --> 1:47:40.520]  your right to banking, everything.
[1:47:40.520 --> 1:47:41.520]  It's official.
[1:47:41.520 --> 1:47:43.520]  And they've done this to General Flynn.
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:44.520]  They've done it to me.
[1:47:44.520 --> 1:47:45.520]  They've done it to Roger Stone.
[1:47:45.520 --> 1:47:47.520]  And I don't even get into all the stuff they've done.
[1:47:47.520 --> 1:47:53.520]  But yeah, banned basically from everything, Airbnb, credit cards,
[1:47:53.520 --> 1:47:55.520]  bank accounts, whatever.
[1:47:55.520 --> 1:47:56.520]  It just made us stronger.
[1:47:56.520 --> 1:47:57.520]  We worked around it.
[1:47:57.520 --> 1:48:01.520]  And in the future, that's not going to be there.
[1:48:01.520 --> 1:48:05.520]  So the whole future is going to be what the globalists talk about
[1:48:05.520 --> 1:48:10.520]  in their prospectus, ghettos, country ghettos and city ghettos,
[1:48:10.520 --> 1:48:12.520]  where those that don't take the microchips,
[1:48:12.520 --> 1:48:16.520]  that's in the same Plandopolis report put up by the UN
[1:48:16.520 --> 1:48:19.520]  and the Rockefeller Foundation in 2011.
[1:48:19.520 --> 1:48:23.520]  And it says you will be forcibly put in ghettos.
[1:48:23.520 --> 1:48:26.520]  And if you leave the ghettos and don't take a microchip,
[1:48:26.520 --> 1:48:28.520]  you're going to be shot.
[1:48:28.520 --> 1:48:30.520]  They even describe how they're going to go into rural areas
[1:48:30.520 --> 1:48:32.520]  and force you to go into the cities.
[1:48:32.520 --> 1:48:36.520]  If you don't want your five-year-old being taught how to give a blow job,
[1:48:36.520 --> 1:48:39.520]  or if your five-year-old doesn't want to be put on, you know,
[1:48:39.520 --> 1:48:42.520]  hormone blockers or whatever, you don't want that.
[1:48:42.520 --> 1:48:47.520]  They're going to put you in a basically open air concentration camp.
[1:48:47.520 --> 1:48:50.520]  So this is all being announced.
[1:48:50.520 --> 1:48:52.520]  And they go, oh, the world's too expensive.
[1:48:52.520 --> 1:48:54.520]  The capitalist system fell apart.
[1:48:54.520 --> 1:48:56.520]  So the UN had to take the world over.
[1:48:56.520 --> 1:48:58.520]  They're purposely breaking it.
[1:48:58.520 --> 1:49:02.520]  That's Cloward and Piven.
[1:49:02.520 --> 1:49:05.520]  So this is all official. How do I know it's coming?
[1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:07.520]  They write books. They write white papers.
[1:49:07.520 --> 1:49:09.520]  They have cartoons for children.
[1:49:09.520 --> 1:49:11.520]  And you watch it and go, this is a hellish dystopia.
[1:49:11.520 --> 1:49:13.520]  They're showing kids it's fun and happy.
[1:49:13.520 --> 1:49:18.520]  And they don't know any better. They're growing up in it.
[1:49:18.520 --> 1:49:21.520]  Just like children don't know what a landline is.
[1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:23.520]  Children don't know what a newspaper is.
[1:49:23.520 --> 1:49:26.520]  They don't even know how to garden because they've been domesticated
[1:49:26.520 --> 1:49:28.520]  for what's about to happen.
[1:49:28.520 --> 1:49:30.520]  This has all been very well planned.
[1:49:30.520 --> 1:49:32.520]  Women don't breastfeed.
[1:49:32.520 --> 1:49:34.520]  Women don't have children vaginally.
[1:49:34.520 --> 1:49:36.520]  Everything's becoming artificial.
[1:49:36.520 --> 1:49:38.520]  And the globalists admit that's their plan.
[1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:40.520]  So I'm going to go to your phone calls.
[1:49:40.520 --> 1:49:45.520]  It's just we are now at the point where we're not in beta.
[1:49:45.520 --> 1:49:47.520]  We're in operational.
[1:49:47.520 --> 1:49:49.520]  And it's not big tech in the banks and the media are separate.
[1:49:49.520 --> 1:49:51.520]  They're all one group.
[1:49:51.520 --> 1:49:53.520]  Linked up with those that run the military.
[1:49:53.520 --> 1:49:55.520]  I think the military is going to save you.
[1:49:55.520 --> 1:49:57.520]  The globalists run the Pentagon.
[1:49:57.520 --> 1:49:59.520]  The worst people ever run the top of the Pentagon.
[1:49:59.520 --> 1:50:02.520]  The globalists put their people in.
[1:50:02.520 --> 1:50:05.520]  And now they're culling the military with all these litmus tests
[1:50:05.520 --> 1:50:07.520]  of, oh, you're racist because you love America.
[1:50:07.520 --> 1:50:10.520]  Or, oh, you're kicked out because you won't take a shot.
[1:50:10.520 --> 1:50:14.520]  That's designed to get the smart people out and collapse things further.
[1:50:14.520 --> 1:50:16.520]  It doesn't mean you go ahead and take the shot.
[1:50:16.520 --> 1:50:18.520]  They give you a hobson's choice.
[1:50:18.520 --> 1:50:21.520]  But this has all been war-gamed.
[1:50:21.520 --> 1:50:23.520]  And where is the senators?
[1:50:23.520 --> 1:50:25.520]  Where are the House members?
[1:50:25.520 --> 1:50:26.520]  Where are the legislatures?
[1:50:26.520 --> 1:50:27.520]  Where are the governors?
[1:50:27.520 --> 1:50:29.520]  DeSantis is the best thing we got?
[1:50:29.520 --> 1:50:31.520]  He's a C-minus.
[1:50:31.520 --> 1:50:35.520]  The only one with a passing grade, in my opinion, of any governor
[1:50:35.520 --> 1:50:37.520]  who actually talks about some of the larger fraud
[1:50:37.520 --> 1:50:39.520]  in the globalist operations.
[1:50:39.520 --> 1:50:41.520]  Trump, for all his problems, talked about the UN,
[1:50:41.520 --> 1:50:43.520]  talked about the China virus, talked about Fauci.
[1:50:43.520 --> 1:50:45.520]  We need to see all of that and more.
[1:50:45.520 --> 1:50:47.520]  Ten times more than what Trump did.
[1:50:47.520 --> 1:50:50.520]  Should I go protest outside of Mar-a-Lango?
[1:50:53.520 --> 1:50:55.520]  Because let me tell you how Trump works.
[1:50:55.520 --> 1:50:57.520]  If I go have some lapdog meeting with Trump,
[1:50:57.520 --> 1:50:59.520]  he'll just talk the whole time and pat me on the head.
[1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:02.520]  If I go bullhorn him for maybe three days straight,
[1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:03.520]  then he'll probably listen.
[1:51:03.520 --> 1:51:04.520]  That's what gets his attention.
[1:51:04.520 --> 1:51:07.520]  In fact, we should go protest at Trump's house
[1:51:07.520 --> 1:51:09.520]  and say, you're the best thing we had.
[1:51:09.520 --> 1:51:11.520]  Will you please speak out about the New World Order
[1:51:11.520 --> 1:51:13.520]  and the carbon tax and the world government?
[1:51:13.520 --> 1:51:14.520]  You help get us into this.
[1:51:14.520 --> 1:51:16.520]  They lied to you about the vaccine.
[1:51:16.520 --> 1:51:18.520]  We understand you got set up.
[1:51:18.520 --> 1:51:19.520]  Now you're starting to expose it.
[1:51:19.520 --> 1:51:20.520]  Come all the way.
[1:51:22.520 --> 1:51:24.520]  But why won't Rand Paul and them go all the way
[1:51:24.520 --> 1:51:25.520]  and talk about this?
[1:51:25.520 --> 1:51:28.520]  Because, I mean, the UN does, the Davos Group does.
[1:51:28.520 --> 1:51:31.520]  The big corporations say we're bringing in the great reset.
[1:51:31.520 --> 1:51:34.520]  We're going to have carbon lockdowns every year.
[1:51:34.520 --> 1:51:37.520]  Sure, he talks about how we're going under authoritarianism.
[1:51:37.520 --> 1:51:39.520]  That's good, but what does that mean?
[1:51:39.520 --> 1:51:41.520]  Who's putting us under authoritarianism?
[1:51:41.520 --> 1:51:46.520]  Rand Paul, the UN, the Davos Group.
[1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:48.520]  Let me show you again, Senator Paul.
[1:51:48.520 --> 1:51:51.520]  Here's screenshots from the World Economic Forum site and video.
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:54.520]  COVID passed plans to launch.
[1:51:54.520 --> 1:51:57.520]  Users will have their blood screened every time they travel.
[1:51:57.520 --> 1:51:59.520]  To preserve the environment,
[1:51:59.520 --> 1:52:02.520]  benefits of reduced air travel during the crisis,
[1:52:02.520 --> 1:52:04.520]  we have a carbon tax through the apps,
[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:09.520]  now being implemented by the Fortune 500 partners.
[1:52:09.520 --> 1:52:11.520]  Oh, but don't worry, it's going to track everything you do,
[1:52:11.520 --> 1:52:13.520]  but won't surveil you.
[1:52:13.520 --> 1:52:18.520]  You know, it's like saying a woman having an orgy with 500 men
[1:52:18.520 --> 1:52:19.520]  isn't having sex.
[1:52:19.520 --> 1:52:21.520]  I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[1:52:21.520 --> 1:52:24.520]  So all the double thing, all the gaslighting,
[1:52:24.520 --> 1:52:26.520]  all the crap, all the lies.
[1:52:26.520 --> 1:52:30.520]  Do you guys get that video from them protesting outside Downing Street
[1:52:30.520 --> 1:52:31.520]  while Bill Gates is inside?
[1:52:31.520 --> 1:52:33.520]  Let's go ahead and roll that video.
[1:52:33.520 --> 1:52:37.520]  The police attacking people that dared peacefully stand on the sidewalk
[1:52:37.520 --> 1:52:40.520]  because you're not allowed to do that now because of COVID rules
[1:52:40.520 --> 1:52:42.520]  they can enforce anytime they want.
[1:52:42.520 --> 1:52:45.520]  Police attacking people for daring to say arrest Bill Gates.
[1:52:45.520 --> 1:52:46.520]  Here it is.
[1:52:46.520 --> 1:53:14.520]  Arrest Bill Gates! Arrest Bill Gates! Arrest Bill Gates! Arrest Bill Gates! Arrest Bill Gates! Arrest Bill Gates!
[1:53:14.520 --> 1:53:17.920]  All right, we got more videos coming in of police arresting people.
[1:53:17.920 --> 1:53:18.920]  That's what I've read.
[1:53:18.920 --> 1:53:19.920]  We don't have those yet.
[1:53:19.920 --> 1:53:22.720]  But we're told that's Bill Gates trying to go in and this is what happened.
[1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:24.360]  This is beautiful.
[1:53:24.360 --> 1:53:28.600]  Everywhere he goes, people need to be in his murdering face.
[1:53:28.600 --> 1:53:32.120]  People tell me, they say, Jones, you better watch out, you know, you've really pissed
[1:53:32.120 --> 1:53:33.120]  the globalist off.
[1:53:33.120 --> 1:53:35.920]  They don't want to make you a martyr, but you're really pushing it.
[1:53:35.920 --> 1:53:38.560]  Selling out 1% selling out all the way.
[1:53:38.560 --> 1:53:43.480]  So I'm going to intensify what I'm doing, not because I have a death wish or not because
[1:53:43.480 --> 1:53:44.920]  I don't want to be set up and put in prison.
[1:53:44.920 --> 1:53:49.600]  I know they got a whole bunch of grand juries and FBI around the clock trying to find something
[1:53:49.600 --> 1:53:51.240]  to frame us and put me in jail.
[1:53:51.240 --> 1:53:53.640]  I mean, my God, you're killing unborn children.
[1:53:53.640 --> 1:53:57.360]  You're killing already born children, pedophilias being promoted on the national news.
[1:53:57.360 --> 1:54:03.040]  I cannot support this satanic system.
[1:54:03.040 --> 1:54:05.880]  Everybody thinks, oh, they'll get you if you stand up.
[1:54:05.880 --> 1:54:08.200]  They're going to get everybody if we don't stand up.
[1:54:08.200 --> 1:54:13.880]  The only course of survival is going 110% on against these people.
[1:54:13.880 --> 1:54:16.200]  You don't play sports and go 90%.
[1:54:16.200 --> 1:54:17.200]  That's how you get injured.
[1:54:17.200 --> 1:54:19.800]  You got to go 100% or you get hurt every time.
[1:54:19.800 --> 1:54:23.200]  But if I get hurt, that's the way it is, folks, because somebody's got to stand up to these
[1:54:23.200 --> 1:54:24.200]  people.
[1:54:24.200 --> 1:54:26.280]  They're already saying you're not essential.
[1:54:26.280 --> 1:54:27.280]  They're already locking you up.
[1:54:27.280 --> 1:54:29.040]  They're already taking over the whole world.
[1:54:29.040 --> 1:54:30.440]  They're already engaged in all this tyranny.
[1:54:30.440 --> 1:54:31.440]  What are you going to do?
[1:54:31.440 --> 1:54:34.960]  I promise we're going to go to break and go right back with Aaron and all the other callers.
[1:54:34.960 --> 1:54:38.280]  In fact, we'll do it the whole next hour, and then I've got to spend some time on these
[1:54:38.280 --> 1:54:41.280]  big issues and these big stories I mentioned, but that's coming up separately.
[1:54:41.280 --> 1:54:45.480]  We will not be on air if you do not buy the products, plus the amazing products.
[1:54:45.480 --> 1:54:52.720]  Today is the last day of the big mega supply chain breakdown sale, X-Tube, Winterson, Ultra
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:56.480]  12, 40% to 50% off, 40% off the NA force.
[1:54:56.480 --> 1:55:00.920]  Those sales will end today, because when I get off today, I'm going to go deal with what
[1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:04.200]  we've got left and what the new sale will be, and I can tell you it'll be Body's Ultimate
[1:55:04.200 --> 1:55:10.080]  Formula that's not for sale yet, but is arriving, and I've told it just arrived here at InfoWars.
[1:55:10.080 --> 1:55:19.320]  So again, this is the last day, ladies and gentlemen, infowarsstore.com, or triple-8253-3139.
[1:55:19.320 --> 1:55:23.920]  Down and out sleep aid, 50% off, eight great natural compounds give you deeper, cleaner,
[1:55:23.920 --> 1:55:24.920]  restful sleep.
[1:55:24.920 --> 1:55:26.240]  That's the missing link.
[1:55:26.240 --> 1:55:30.120]  The final piece, if you've got the right vitamins and minerals and things to then have the deep
[1:55:30.120 --> 1:55:33.400]  restful sleep, that takes the immune system to the next level.
[1:55:33.400 --> 1:55:34.400]  Get down and out.
[1:55:34.400 --> 1:55:38.400]  It's some of the strongest, best, healthiest sleep aid you're going to find out there.
[1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:43.400]  So check it out today, infowarsstore.com, or triple-8253-3139.
[1:55:43.400 --> 1:55:49.920]  All right, we're going to be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with your phone calls
[1:55:49.920 --> 1:55:52.120]  in T-minus two minutes.
[1:55:52.120 --> 1:55:53.120]  Please take action.
[1:55:53.120 --> 1:55:58.960]  Please tell people about the live show.
[1:55:58.960 --> 1:56:08.600]  The COVID-19 face diaper is a symbol of subservience, a symbol of slavery, a symbol of the chains
[1:56:08.600 --> 1:56:13.000]  that the medical tyranny combine controlled by the global private corporations has put
[1:56:13.000 --> 1:56:14.000]  in place.
[1:56:14.000 --> 1:56:19.520]  It is the symbol of the permanent emergency from which we will never emerge.
[1:56:19.520 --> 1:56:24.960]  It is the symbol that we are diseased and evil and bad and must cover our diseased criminal
[1:56:24.960 --> 1:56:27.920]  faces from the light of the sun.
[1:56:27.920 --> 1:56:36.040]  It is the symbol of our complete and total absolute surrender to evil.
[1:56:36.040 --> 1:56:40.480]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are crossing the Rubicon now.
[1:56:40.480 --> 1:56:43.720]  The entire future destiny of humanity is upon us.
[1:56:43.720 --> 1:56:47.360]  Klaus Schwab and the UN admit they're coming out with implantable microchips as part of
[1:56:47.360 --> 1:56:50.200]  the World ID and Carbon Taxes.
[1:56:50.200 --> 1:56:52.360]  Things only get worse from here if we submit.
[1:56:52.360 --> 1:56:55.760]  They only get better if we resist and say no.
[1:56:55.760 --> 1:56:59.600]  Noncompliance, noncompliance, noncompliance.
[1:56:59.600 --> 1:57:06.480]  At the time of cutting this announcement, it is the morning of Sunday, October 17th.
[1:57:06.480 --> 1:57:15.560]  And that means there is less than 48 hours left to take advantage of our emergency mega
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:21.080]  blowout sale that is tied directly to these supply chain breakdowns happening across the
[1:57:21.080 --> 1:57:26.680]  world by design for the Great Reset as the central banks attempt to bankrupt the main
[1:57:26.680 --> 1:57:31.960]  line economy to consolidate it and to move in with the quadrillions of fake currency
[1:57:31.960 --> 1:57:36.040]  they have to buy up what is left of the infrastructure that they don't already control.
[1:57:36.040 --> 1:57:41.920]  This is economic warfare and so Info Wars is under attack like every other pro-American
[1:57:41.920 --> 1:57:46.320]  independent organization and we need funding and so despite the fact that we're running
[1:57:46.320 --> 1:57:50.440]  out of a lot of our best selling products, I'm still offering them at huge sale prices
[1:57:50.440 --> 1:57:53.120]  because I need to move them out to get the capital in.
[1:57:53.120 --> 1:58:02.440]  So take advantage of this sale, it's only running until Monday night at infowarstore.com.
[1:58:02.440 --> 1:58:29.200]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:58:29.200 --> 1:58:37.840]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are back live here on the Alex Jones show and we got
[1:58:37.840 --> 1:58:38.840]  loaded phone lines.
[1:58:38.840 --> 1:58:44.800]  We got Info Warrior, we got Robbie, we got Andrew Tim, Lone Wolf, James, Aaron, Connor,
[1:58:44.800 --> 1:58:46.000]  control demolition and John.
[1:58:46.000 --> 1:58:49.360]  I'm going to get to every one of these callers in this hour.
[1:58:49.360 --> 1:58:51.760]  Let's go to Aaron in FEMA region six.
[1:58:51.760 --> 1:58:55.360]  I'm glad you told us about Bill Gates and an elite meeting of globalists happening in
[1:58:55.360 --> 1:58:59.160]  Britain and we confirmed it's happening and it looks like there's a lot of protesters
[1:58:59.160 --> 1:59:03.920]  there right now pointing out that Bill Gates should be arrested for his bio-weapon attack.
[1:59:03.920 --> 1:59:12.800]  Yes, sir, I kind of connected the dots this morning when I saw a happy anniversary today
[1:59:12.800 --> 1:59:19.920]  is the two-year anniversary of the event 201 pandemic simulation.
[1:59:19.920 --> 1:59:24.200]  So I find it rather odd that they're meeting again on the same date.
[1:59:24.200 --> 1:59:26.960]  What do you think they'll be talking about at this meeting?
[1:59:26.960 --> 1:59:31.440]  Oh, no, no doubt they're planning because the center of the web is London.
[1:59:31.440 --> 1:59:35.080]  They're planning the next attack they're about to launch and deciding on whether or not
[1:59:35.080 --> 1:59:36.080]  they're going to implement it.
[1:59:36.080 --> 1:59:39.280]  In fact, a lot of them have been acting like they may not go with the next phase.
[1:59:39.280 --> 1:59:42.960]  I think Gates is probably there saying no, launch the attack because, you know, he's
[1:59:42.960 --> 1:59:46.000]  fallen from favor.
[1:59:46.000 --> 1:59:49.520]  He was field marshaling a lot of this, but about six months ago they started pulling
[1:59:49.520 --> 1:59:53.960]  him back because he was hurting their agenda as a symbol of evil because we'd exposed
[1:59:53.960 --> 1:59:54.960]  him.
[1:59:54.960 --> 1:59:55.960]  You'd exposed him.
[1:59:55.960 --> 1:59:58.320]  And then remember what Boris Johnson said last year.
[1:59:58.320 --> 2:00:05.960]  He said Bill Gates, when I am the head of the G8 for 2021, when we have the rotating
[2:00:05.960 --> 2:00:10.360]  year every eight years, he said Bill Gates will be the shadow head of the G8.
[2:00:10.360 --> 2:00:12.680]  I will do what Bill Gates says.
[2:00:12.680 --> 2:00:13.920]  So I'm glad you raised that point.
[2:00:13.920 --> 2:00:19.960]  You just reminded me that Boris Johnson said Bill Gates is in charge of the G8.
[2:00:19.960 --> 2:00:20.960]  Awesome.
[2:00:20.960 --> 2:00:23.960]  Well, I'm glad that we're putting these pieces together.
[2:00:23.960 --> 2:00:31.960]  I'm not sure if you saw that Gates' daughter got married this weekend to a Egyptian equestrian.
[2:00:31.960 --> 2:00:36.880]  So just all these kind of coincidences and things going on just raise a lot of red flags
[2:00:36.880 --> 2:00:37.880]  for us.
[2:00:37.880 --> 2:00:38.880]  Oh, absolutely.
[2:00:38.880 --> 2:00:44.960]  I mean, it's more globalist insider families intermarrying with, quote, an equestrian.
[2:00:44.960 --> 2:00:48.000]  Oh, he's not from a rich, super powerful family.
[2:00:48.000 --> 2:00:52.280]  Just like Anderson Cooper, isn't the heir to three of the richest families in the world.
[2:00:52.280 --> 2:00:53.280]  No.
[2:00:53.280 --> 2:00:54.280]  He owns nothing.
[2:00:54.280 --> 2:00:55.880]  If you look up his wealth, he owns nothing.
[2:00:55.880 --> 2:00:57.380]  He has nothing.
[2:00:57.380 --> 2:00:58.380]  He's a saint.
[2:00:58.380 --> 2:00:59.380]  He's an angel.
[2:00:59.380 --> 2:01:02.560]  It's you that's going to own nothing and have nothing as well, they tell us.
[2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:03.560]  So very, very interesting.
[2:01:03.560 --> 2:01:04.680]  Aaron, thanks for the call.
[2:01:04.680 --> 2:01:05.680]  Thanks for the points.
[2:01:05.680 --> 2:01:07.200]  Yeah, guys, look that up.
[2:01:07.200 --> 2:01:13.920]  I remember it was like over a year ago, he goes, Boris Johnson says Bill Gates will
[2:01:13.920 --> 2:01:17.440]  advise the G8.
[2:01:17.440 --> 2:01:20.720]  Bill Gates will be shadow minister on G8.
[2:01:20.720 --> 2:01:21.720]  It was something like that.
[2:01:21.720 --> 2:01:26.800]  And in the article, it's quotes of him saying, Bill Gates does such a great job of the pandemic
[2:01:26.800 --> 2:01:27.800]  and leading forward.
[2:01:27.800 --> 2:01:32.120]  He's going to help us next year with the ongoing systems when we control the G8.
[2:01:32.120 --> 2:01:33.120]  He'll be my main advisor.
[2:01:33.120 --> 2:01:34.120]  I mean, wow.
[2:01:34.120 --> 2:01:37.640]  Talk about kissing Gates's ass.
[2:01:37.640 --> 2:01:40.560]  So I'm going to go to break in a minute and a half.
[2:01:40.560 --> 2:01:41.560]  We've got a long segment coming up.
[2:01:41.560 --> 2:01:44.160]  I'm not going to go to college yet because I don't want to cut you off.
[2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:48.360]  Who's up next year?
[2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:50.600]  Connor's got a question from California.
[2:01:50.600 --> 2:01:52.960]  What will we do to educate the children about tyranny?
[2:01:52.960 --> 2:01:56.800]  Man, that's a really important question in a place I've dropped the ball, even my own
[2:01:56.800 --> 2:02:00.000]  children because it's like, how do you tell them all this horrible stuff?
[2:02:00.000 --> 2:02:01.880]  And then if you don't, the school's going to do it.
[2:02:01.880 --> 2:02:03.480]  The system's going to do it.
[2:02:03.480 --> 2:02:04.880]  And we've got control demolition.
[2:02:04.880 --> 2:02:10.240]  Once I'm mainstream conservatives against Fauci, but taking the VACs, info warrior.
[2:02:10.240 --> 2:02:14.440]  Once you talk about it, it's time to pull, to pull horn.
[2:02:14.440 --> 2:02:16.560]  It's actually bullhorn.
[2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:17.560]  My eyes are failing.
[2:02:17.560 --> 2:02:20.040]  It's time to bullhorn and protest.
[2:02:20.040 --> 2:02:21.480]  I totally agree.
[2:02:21.480 --> 2:02:25.520]  Robbie in Florida, father got the Pfizer shot, died months later.
[2:02:25.520 --> 2:02:28.280]  Sorry to hear that Robbie will go to you.
[2:02:28.280 --> 2:02:33.400]  Andrews in Texas, healthcare worker on the COVID VACs, Tim, 1776 Worldwide Gate Foundation
[2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:43.040]  protest, lone wolf, vaccine passports in big cities, James CNN, hit piece aired last night
[2:02:43.040 --> 2:02:44.040]  on Alex Jones.
[2:02:44.040 --> 2:02:45.040]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[2:02:45.040 --> 2:02:49.880]  I can't even keep track of all these is John Oliver attacking to call a bunch of damn
[2:02:49.880 --> 2:02:50.880]  lies.
[2:02:50.880 --> 2:02:51.880]  Jones is crazy.
[2:02:51.880 --> 2:02:53.600]  He claims it's curious for COVID.
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:55.800]  Yeah, it's called your immune system.
[2:02:55.800 --> 2:02:58.520]  There's no such thing as any cure for COVID.
[2:02:58.520 --> 2:03:00.080]  Only the vaccine will protect you.
[2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:03.200]  Look at Colin Powell or Hank Aaron or so many others.
[2:03:03.200 --> 2:03:29.520]  Look what I did for them.
[2:03:29.520 --> 2:03:32.520]  That's basically the ethos of the globalists.
[2:03:32.520 --> 2:03:35.440]  They must first play God.
[2:03:35.440 --> 2:03:42.000]  They must first prove that they are the fittest in their social Darwinistic system.
[2:03:42.000 --> 2:03:43.280]  And in a way, they're right.
[2:03:43.280 --> 2:03:49.280]  If we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us and destroy our children's futures,
[2:03:49.280 --> 2:03:51.000]  the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open.
[2:03:51.000 --> 2:03:54.720]  We really deserve what's happened to us.
[2:03:54.720 --> 2:04:01.040]  So I asked you now, are you going to step up and expose the new order even more?
[2:04:01.040 --> 2:04:04.880]  I know I'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts.
[2:04:04.880 --> 2:04:12.800]  The front lines of the fight is info wars.com.
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:15.400]  Waging war on corruption.
[2:04:15.400 --> 2:04:21.040]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[2:04:21.040 --> 2:04:29.480]  So for the last two hours, I asked the question, why are conservative leaders like Rand Paul
[2:04:29.480 --> 2:04:32.760]  and Ted Cruz and other people that I think are great people and super smart?
[2:04:32.760 --> 2:04:34.000]  I know they are.
[2:04:34.000 --> 2:04:37.680]  Why aren't they talking about the Deimos Group and major corporations announcing world government,
[2:04:37.680 --> 2:04:40.840]  world IDs that they're going to have carbon taxes on?
[2:04:40.840 --> 2:04:42.600]  They're not announcing it.
[2:04:42.600 --> 2:04:44.240]  It's launched.
[2:04:44.240 --> 2:04:45.240]  It's going on.
[2:04:45.240 --> 2:04:47.960]  I mean, world government taking over.
[2:04:47.960 --> 2:04:54.880]  World government pushing Congresses and legislatures aside.
[2:04:54.880 --> 2:04:57.520]  Absolute total tyranny.
[2:04:57.520 --> 2:04:59.320]  And remember what he said three weeks ago.
[2:04:59.320 --> 2:05:01.760]  I played the clip like five times.
[2:05:01.760 --> 2:05:07.920]  John Kerry, the climate czar, was asked on national British television, what are you
[2:05:07.920 --> 2:05:12.840]  going to do about the fact if you pass carbon taxes in the U.S. and Republicans just regain
[2:05:12.840 --> 2:05:14.560]  the house next year?
[2:05:14.560 --> 2:05:15.560]  He said, we don't care.
[2:05:15.560 --> 2:05:17.600]  We're doing this through the corporations in the U.N.
[2:05:17.600 --> 2:05:19.240]  They're implementing it.
[2:05:19.240 --> 2:05:20.240]  Nothing will stop us.
[2:05:20.240 --> 2:05:21.240]  That's the quote.
[2:05:21.240 --> 2:05:22.240]  It's going to happen.
[2:05:22.240 --> 2:05:26.080]  I mean, man, gosh, this is so bad.
[2:05:26.080 --> 2:05:29.960]  Even if you're willing to pay the $1.5 trillion in taxes that are selectively only put on
[2:05:29.960 --> 2:05:34.760]  certain companies, it is designed to create a post-industrial world and replace stuff
[2:05:34.760 --> 2:05:36.640]  with things that don't work.
[2:05:36.640 --> 2:05:39.840]  So this is very, very serious.
[2:05:39.840 --> 2:05:43.560]  And they wear their stupid mask when they're on TV, but when he's on a plane, he doesn't
[2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:46.040]  wear it.
[2:05:46.040 --> 2:05:50.400]  So they're rubbing everyone's faces in all of it.
[2:05:50.400 --> 2:05:55.840]  And now Colin Powell died of COVID complications that were taking the COVID injection.
[2:05:55.840 --> 2:05:59.120]  He got callers on that same subject, robbing and others.
[2:05:59.120 --> 2:06:06.240]  But right now, let's go ahead and talk to James.
[2:06:06.240 --> 2:06:09.760]  Let's go ahead and talk to James from Texas.
[2:06:09.760 --> 2:06:11.880]  CNN hit piece aired last night on Alex Jones.
[2:06:11.880 --> 2:06:13.200]  I didn't know that.
[2:06:13.200 --> 2:06:16.360]  There's so many hit pieces, CNN doesn't have very many viewers.
[2:06:16.360 --> 2:06:18.880]  So what is 500,000 libtards watching?
[2:06:18.880 --> 2:06:22.960]  But it's important because they're the mouth of the establishment and shows are really
[2:06:22.960 --> 2:06:23.960]  mad at me.
[2:06:23.960 --> 2:06:27.120]  I don't have every week that I know of media matters attacked again.
[2:06:27.120 --> 2:06:29.480]  And John Oliver does have a big audience on HBO.
[2:06:29.480 --> 2:06:33.600]  He came out today sickening evil hit piece saying that not only should Alex Jones be
[2:06:33.600 --> 2:06:37.200]  fully taken off the air, everyone else like him should be.
[2:06:37.200 --> 2:06:40.200]  Then he goes, this guy's the Vietnamese Alex Jones.
[2:06:40.200 --> 2:06:42.320]  This lady's the Hispanic Alex Jones.
[2:06:42.320 --> 2:06:45.840]  We need to silence them.
[2:06:45.840 --> 2:06:51.840]  And all they say is, Communist China controls Biden, America's being sold out.
[2:06:51.840 --> 2:06:54.080]  But the COVID vaccine's causing damage.
[2:06:54.080 --> 2:06:55.080]  I mean, all that's true.
[2:06:55.080 --> 2:06:56.560]  But even it was a lie.
[2:06:56.560 --> 2:06:57.560]  They should have the free speech.
[2:06:57.560 --> 2:06:58.560]  Right?
[2:06:58.560 --> 2:06:59.560]  I mean, John Oliver lies all day.
[2:06:59.560 --> 2:07:00.560]  Let's see.
[2:07:00.560 --> 2:07:01.560]  He works for the power structure.
[2:07:01.560 --> 2:07:04.000]  So let's talk to James in Texas.
[2:07:04.000 --> 2:07:06.400]  Tell me about the CNN hit piece so I can find it.
[2:07:06.400 --> 2:07:07.840]  Can you hear me okay?
[2:07:07.840 --> 2:07:08.840]  Yes, sir.
[2:07:08.840 --> 2:07:09.840]  I'm just making sure.
[2:07:09.840 --> 2:07:14.520]  They had a guy on there last night that said he was a student that did the filming with
[2:07:14.520 --> 2:07:18.840]  you at Bohemian Grove and was showing images of Bohemian Grove.
[2:07:18.840 --> 2:07:22.840]  We've even mentioned the cremation of care ceremony and said it was all done by a bunch
[2:07:22.840 --> 2:07:23.840]  of rich people.
[2:07:23.840 --> 2:07:29.040]  I don't know how that's a, I don't know how that's a hit piece.
[2:07:29.040 --> 2:07:31.640]  No, we're going after President Trump.
[2:07:31.640 --> 2:07:34.840]  They had David Hogg on doing interviews and all kinds of stuff.
[2:07:34.840 --> 2:07:35.840]  But what show was it?
[2:07:35.840 --> 2:07:40.640]  It was like nine or 10 o'clock last night on main CNN channel because whatever was on
[2:07:40.640 --> 2:07:41.840]  Fox, I switched channels.
[2:07:41.840 --> 2:07:42.840]  I wasn't interested.
[2:07:42.840 --> 2:07:43.840]  Sure.
[2:07:43.840 --> 2:07:45.840]  I mean, I don't even know what that means.
[2:07:45.840 --> 2:07:47.840]  Who said they snuck in Bohemian Grove with me?
[2:07:47.840 --> 2:07:51.840]  They said the guy was a student that you had him.
[2:07:51.840 --> 2:07:55.040]  He was the one doing the filming for you or something like that.
[2:07:55.040 --> 2:07:56.040]  That is a complete lie.
[2:07:56.040 --> 2:08:00.760]  I shot the video in there in a little fanny pack I had on that.
[2:08:00.760 --> 2:08:02.840]  That is total BS.
[2:08:02.840 --> 2:08:03.840]  Wow.
[2:08:03.840 --> 2:08:06.840]  I mean, all they do is lie anyways.
[2:08:06.840 --> 2:08:08.240]  God knows what they'll do next.
[2:08:08.240 --> 2:08:12.280]  I mean, the stuff they do, the stuff they say, it's just mind blowing.
[2:08:12.280 --> 2:08:15.640]  Well, what were they saying about Bohemian Grove?
[2:08:15.640 --> 2:08:19.140]  They were actually showing images of it and showing the fireworks and stuff going off
[2:08:19.140 --> 2:08:20.640]  while they were all standing there.
[2:08:20.640 --> 2:08:24.640]  It was a more clear picture image of it than I've ever seen.
[2:08:24.640 --> 2:08:27.640]  Yeah, there's a tweet about it.
[2:08:27.640 --> 2:08:31.120]  CNN's Lisa Lang did a show.
[2:08:31.120 --> 2:08:37.200]  This is life on conspiracies and on cue and the John Burt's society looking for communists
[2:08:37.200 --> 2:08:39.040]  and the message hasn't changed.
[2:08:39.040 --> 2:08:40.880]  It shows the rise of Alex Jones.
[2:08:40.880 --> 2:08:42.560]  This show was a wake up call.
[2:08:42.560 --> 2:08:46.440]  I mean, the John Burt's society of anything, they haven't been active enough the last 20
[2:08:46.440 --> 2:08:47.440]  years.
[2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:48.440]  They're great people.
[2:08:48.440 --> 2:08:56.880]  Everything that John Burt's founder said 65 years ago, 70 years ago, came true.
[2:08:56.880 --> 2:08:59.720]  And they said, communist China will take over the world.
[2:08:59.720 --> 2:09:02.960]  They said, the Vietnam War is a wrong and a fraud.
[2:09:02.960 --> 2:09:08.160]  They said that the leftist anti-war movements, CIA controlled and dialectic.
[2:09:08.160 --> 2:09:09.600]  They exposed false flag terror.
[2:09:09.600 --> 2:09:13.640]  They exposed the plan for global government, UN, world government, carbon tax.
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:17.280]  First time I've ever read about that was like 30 years ago before I was even on air from
[2:09:17.280 --> 2:09:18.480]  the John Burt's society.
[2:09:18.480 --> 2:09:22.600]  So there, I mean, what do you make of this, James, that world government is out in the
[2:09:22.600 --> 2:09:23.600]  open?
[2:09:23.600 --> 2:09:25.480]  I mean, I know I spent two hours on one story.
[2:09:25.480 --> 2:09:29.400]  I have hundreds and hundreds of incredible things, but isn't it a big deal that the mark
[2:09:29.400 --> 2:09:33.640]  of the beast has been announced by the Fortune 500, the merchants of the world, as the Bible
[2:09:33.640 --> 2:09:39.560]  says, through the UN, through the Davos Group, with a carbon tax to track you in lifetime,
[2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:43.560]  through the vaccine passport, it's official now being rolled out.
[2:09:43.560 --> 2:09:45.360]  Is that not incredible, sir?
[2:09:45.360 --> 2:09:46.360]  Yes, it is.
[2:09:46.360 --> 2:09:47.360]  The veil is being lifted.
[2:09:47.360 --> 2:09:50.800]  It just, like he talks about in the Bible, about the truth being lies and the lies being
[2:09:50.800 --> 2:09:54.360]  true.
[2:09:54.360 --> 2:09:56.360]  What else did you notice about the show?
[2:09:56.360 --> 2:10:01.880]  Like I said, they were going after Trump had a long interview talking about David Hogg
[2:10:01.880 --> 2:10:06.240]  and going on about his sister being there at the school and everything else.
[2:10:06.240 --> 2:10:10.600]  Going on about him leaving the school and coming back.
[2:10:10.600 --> 2:10:14.000]  You know, we actually met and had a conversation, but it's been like 30 years ago.
[2:10:14.000 --> 2:10:16.280]  This is only the second time I've spoke to you.
[2:10:16.280 --> 2:10:18.760]  Was that at a high school in Fort Worth?
[2:10:18.760 --> 2:10:22.760]  My last, my senior year at high school, I was fresh out of basic training.
[2:10:22.760 --> 2:10:27.160]  Well, I have stomped around Fort Worth in places, but I don't remember, I didn't go
[2:10:27.160 --> 2:10:32.600]  to school in Fort Worth, so I went to school in Dallas and the rest of the time in Austin.
[2:10:32.600 --> 2:10:33.600]  But God bless you.
[2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:34.600]  I appreciate your call, James.
[2:10:34.600 --> 2:10:35.600]  It's a small world.
[2:10:35.600 --> 2:10:42.800]  All right, let's go ahead and talk to Andrew in Texas, healthcare worker on the COVID
[2:10:42.800 --> 2:10:43.800]  vaccine.
[2:10:43.800 --> 2:10:44.800]  We'll talk to Robbie.
[2:10:44.800 --> 2:10:45.800]  Go ahead, Andrew.
[2:10:45.800 --> 2:10:46.800]  Thanks for holding.
[2:10:46.800 --> 2:10:49.720]  I'm going to just go ahead and speak on what you were talking about, why they won't say
[2:10:49.720 --> 2:10:56.160]  they being the constituents, the congressmen, these people in high profile about the devil's
[2:10:56.160 --> 2:10:59.000]  group in the gender 2030 because they know better.
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:01.880]  They don't have the cojones you have and they know if they say something, they're going
[2:11:01.880 --> 2:11:02.880]  to disappear.
[2:11:02.880 --> 2:11:07.320]  Oh, Senator Cruz just passed away with a such-and-such.
[2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:08.320]  That's what I think.
[2:11:08.320 --> 2:11:13.880]  I heard David Webb, I heard a caller calling David Webb, Patriot XM, and then this caller
[2:11:13.880 --> 2:11:18.200]  called in and said, look, I'm going to tell you, David Webb, it's all about, he started
[2:11:18.200 --> 2:11:22.400]  talking about devil's group, agenda 2030, he started talking about, David stop and say,
[2:11:22.400 --> 2:11:25.320]  look, man, I'm not into conspiracy theories.
[2:11:25.320 --> 2:11:28.520]  These FEMA camps, all they're doing there is just, they're keeping supplies in those
[2:11:28.520 --> 2:11:29.520]  places.
[2:11:29.520 --> 2:11:34.400]  They dismissed it, dismissed it, and that's the reason why they don't talk about the devil's
[2:11:34.400 --> 2:11:38.120]  group, agenda 2030, nobody wants to talk about it because it's the truth.
[2:11:38.120 --> 2:11:41.640]  Well, they do have them full of supplies and now they've announced that during the next
[2:11:41.640 --> 2:11:46.120]  pandemic, they're going to put the healthy children in them and take them from families.
[2:11:46.120 --> 2:11:49.200]  That image of children being taken and they'll probably give them back.
[2:11:49.200 --> 2:11:52.240]  But the point is they're setting the precedent that we're all prisoners.
[2:11:52.240 --> 2:11:56.120]  I mean, look at this, all over the world, they're saying from Latin America to Europe,
[2:11:56.120 --> 2:11:58.560]  you don't have a shot, you can't go to the grocery store.
[2:11:58.560 --> 2:12:01.480]  They scan the QR code before you can go in the store.
[2:12:01.480 --> 2:12:05.120]  The doors won't open and if you don't do it, you're arrested.
[2:12:05.120 --> 2:12:09.880]  That's slavery, that's here, that's happening.
[2:12:09.880 --> 2:12:16.000]  And to speak on that, and I called originally is because I'm in the medical field and I
[2:12:16.000 --> 2:12:19.640]  get low quacks, I'm in an office, I'm in a medical field.
[2:12:19.640 --> 2:12:24.360]  There was two of us when the mandate came down from the correspondence.
[2:12:24.360 --> 2:12:25.360]  There was no policy.
[2:12:25.360 --> 2:12:30.600]  We just got an email that said by this day, everybody has to have vaccination.
[2:12:30.600 --> 2:12:32.600]  You can upload it to the portal.
[2:12:32.600 --> 2:12:37.120]  Those who don't want the vaccine can do a religious, which I took in my buddy in Arizona
[2:12:37.120 --> 2:12:40.840]  took, and or a medical exemption.
[2:12:40.840 --> 2:12:43.640]  Now my doctor wasn't going to do it, even though I had heart surgery in 2012.
[2:12:43.640 --> 2:12:44.640]  He said, nope.
[2:12:44.640 --> 2:12:47.080]  He said, I record from the CDC, sir, go get your shot.
[2:12:47.080 --> 2:12:52.680]  I'm not going to do it because my dad took it, never had cancer, died.
[2:12:52.680 --> 2:12:58.880]  My ex-wife's dad got it three days later, died, dead, gone.
[2:12:58.880 --> 2:13:02.000]  So look how it worked out for Colin Powell.
[2:13:02.000 --> 2:13:04.280]  I mean, they're not going to say that though, right?
[2:13:04.280 --> 2:13:08.000]  Well, I mean, maybe Matt Drudge is running the drugs report again or whatever, because
[2:13:08.000 --> 2:13:09.000]  it's been better lately.
[2:13:09.000 --> 2:13:10.000]  Look at that.
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:13.280]  Most media will not point out he was fully vaxed, but the drugs report does.
[2:13:13.280 --> 2:13:18.520]  Colin Powell, dead from COVID, fully vaxed, was fighting cancer.
[2:13:18.520 --> 2:13:20.320]  It's terrible.
[2:13:20.320 --> 2:13:27.400]  Real quick, Alex, if we are in Texas, I'm in Texas, the so-called president or the chief,
[2:13:27.400 --> 2:13:33.000]  you know, whatever he's the chief of, the stolen election, if he just put out correspondence
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:38.360]  or an email, not an executive order, and Governor Abbott said, I'm going to put an EO
[2:13:38.360 --> 2:13:39.360]  out.
[2:13:39.360 --> 2:13:41.680]  Well, who Trump's who and how does that work?
[2:13:41.680 --> 2:13:47.120]  Well, that's a constitutional question of the courts, but if it's a state's rights
[2:13:47.120 --> 2:13:50.480]  issue and constitutional, the state would trump the federal executive order.
[2:13:50.480 --> 2:13:54.120]  I mean, look, Trump tried to stop the illegal aliens running around the sanctuary cities.
[2:13:54.120 --> 2:13:55.120]  The city's just ignoring.
[2:13:55.120 --> 2:13:58.560]  So we can do the same to the globalists with their puppet president.
[2:13:58.560 --> 2:13:59.560]  I appreciate your call.
[2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:03.880]  Okay, I'm going to write to Robbie and others when we come back.
[2:14:03.880 --> 2:14:08.320]  Please stay with us.
[2:14:08.320 --> 2:14:12.120]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:14:12.120 --> 2:14:16.840]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:14:16.840 --> 2:14:17.840]  Here's why.
[2:14:17.840 --> 2:14:21.800]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:14:21.800 --> 2:14:26.800]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:14:26.800 --> 2:14:31.960]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and
[2:14:31.960 --> 2:14:35.880]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:14:35.880 --> 2:14:39.800]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[2:14:39.800 --> 2:14:44.560]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:50.560]  In better all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses, too.
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:54.480]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[2:14:54.480 --> 2:14:56.480]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:14:56.480 --> 2:15:01.080]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk,
[2:15:01.080 --> 2:15:04.960]  and medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[2:15:04.960 --> 2:15:07.040]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[2:15:07.040 --> 2:15:08.680]  Hey, everybody.
[2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:13.680]  If you've ever thought about heirloom beans as a storable survival food, I've got great
[2:15:13.680 --> 2:15:14.680]  news.
[2:15:14.680 --> 2:15:16.760]  In fact, I'll bet it's the best news you've heard in a while.
[2:15:16.760 --> 2:15:17.760]  Here's the thing.
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:23.280]  We've just received a fresh batch of gourmet heirloom beans, survival soup beans.
[2:15:23.280 --> 2:15:28.560]  These beans are gorgeous, highly nutritious, and above all, with no hesitation whatsoever,
[2:15:28.560 --> 2:15:31.360]  the best tasting beans in the entire world.
[2:15:31.360 --> 2:15:32.520]  The best part?
[2:15:32.520 --> 2:15:37.480]  We've dropped the price by 33 percent this week for listeners who know higher food prices
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:41.840]  are coming and want an inflation hedge you can actually eat if you want to.
[2:15:41.840 --> 2:15:42.840]  Gets even better.
[2:15:42.840 --> 2:15:47.520]  With your permission and with a high regard for your health and well-being, I also want
[2:15:47.520 --> 2:15:52.760]  to send you two pounds of what we think is the single most underrated superfood in the
[2:15:52.760 --> 2:15:53.760]  world, period.
[2:15:53.760 --> 2:16:00.240]  Go to soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com, and discover the real reason we're giving
[2:16:00.240 --> 2:16:09.360]  this unusual superfood away at soupbeansurvival.com, that's soupbeansurvival.com.
[2:16:09.360 --> 2:16:15.000]  You'd have to be hiding under a rock not to know that vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc, and
[2:16:15.000 --> 2:16:19.520]  other essential vitamins and minerals are essential to our bodies, to our immune systems.
[2:16:19.520 --> 2:16:21.560]  We don't have them long-term.
[2:16:21.560 --> 2:16:22.720]  We die.
[2:16:22.720 --> 2:16:26.640]  But what a lot of people don't know is even if you have those compounds, the levels that
[2:16:26.640 --> 2:16:32.080]  are recommended, if you don't have deep, restful, clean sleep, your body will fall
[2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:33.600]  apart even faster.
[2:16:33.600 --> 2:16:37.680]  And with so many chemicals in the food and water and so much agitation in the culture
[2:16:37.680 --> 2:16:39.680]  and life, it's hard to settle down.
[2:16:39.680 --> 2:16:40.680]  It's hard to relax.
[2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:44.640]  Well, let me tell you something right now, down and out is an incredibly strong natural
[2:16:44.640 --> 2:16:45.640]  compound.
[2:16:45.640 --> 2:16:50.280]  It's got over eight compounds in it that will give you deep, pure, clean sleep, and it's
[2:16:50.280 --> 2:16:51.280]  such a game changer.
[2:16:51.280 --> 2:16:55.560]  So with all the vitamins and minerals, the last big ingredient is down and out, available
[2:16:55.560 --> 2:16:59.520]  again at m4warstore.com for 50% off.
[2:16:59.520 --> 2:17:00.520]  And you know what?
[2:17:00.520 --> 2:17:03.520]  I'm going to keep it at 50% off until it sells out, even though we've already sold out a
[2:17:03.520 --> 2:17:06.880]  half of it in just the last month, and we probably aren't going to have more for about
[2:17:06.880 --> 2:17:09.520]  five months.
[2:17:09.520 --> 2:17:11.720]  Why do my enemies hate me so much?
[2:17:11.720 --> 2:17:13.320]  Why do the globalists hate you so much?
[2:17:13.320 --> 2:17:16.520]  Why do they hate America so much?
[2:17:16.520 --> 2:17:22.360]  Because it's an idea of freedom that their tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot
[2:17:22.360 --> 2:17:23.360]  coexist with.
[2:17:23.360 --> 2:17:24.520]  It's very, very simple.
[2:17:24.520 --> 2:17:31.200]  For their world government, their anti-human, post-human, eugenics system to flourish, freedom
[2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:37.200]  and liberty and due process, injustice, and God-fearing systems must fail.
[2:17:37.200 --> 2:17:39.760]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[2:17:39.760 --> 2:17:42.720]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[2:17:42.720 --> 2:17:44.640]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[2:17:44.640 --> 2:17:49.560]  They started a fight with you, and they're not going to back down, and they're not going
[2:17:49.560 --> 2:17:55.040]  to go away, and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear
[2:17:55.040 --> 2:17:56.480]  of God put into them.
[2:17:56.480 --> 2:18:00.960]  But the average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order, or about globalism,
[2:18:00.960 --> 2:18:01.960]  or about corporate fascists.
[2:18:01.960 --> 2:18:06.680]  And it's not until people understand that, and that we're under attack that we have any
[2:18:06.680 --> 2:18:36.520]  chance of beating these people.
[2:18:36.680 --> 2:18:40.480]  They've turned us into a bunch of domesticated jellyfish, and now the globalists are making
[2:18:40.480 --> 2:18:41.480]  their move on humanity.
[2:18:41.480 --> 2:18:46.040]  And yeah, it's easy to get mad at the dumbed-out masses and say they get what they deserve,
[2:18:46.040 --> 2:18:49.440]  not being informed and fighting back, but the children don't deserve that.
[2:18:49.440 --> 2:18:54.920]  And God's watching, and God wants us to stand up and do the right thing, and we will.
[2:18:54.920 --> 2:18:56.440]  We will bring the New World Order to justice.
[2:18:56.440 --> 2:18:59.960]  They're not in power because they're people, they're in power because they're corrupt and
[2:18:59.960 --> 2:19:04.760]  willing to do it, and they have a drive to dominate and kill.
[2:19:04.760 --> 2:19:06.040]  It doesn't mean they're going to succeed.
[2:19:06.040 --> 2:19:07.640]  It means they can't help it.
[2:19:07.640 --> 2:19:12.280]  So we need to stop acting like they're the authorities, they're not.
[2:19:12.280 --> 2:19:15.920]  They're trying to overthrow the local police, because they want to be in control of the
[2:19:15.920 --> 2:19:16.920]  police.
[2:19:16.920 --> 2:19:18.240]  They want to overthrow our economy.
[2:19:18.240 --> 2:19:23.800]  They want to make us dependent so they can enslave us and kill us.
[2:19:23.800 --> 2:19:26.920]  That's the whole Left ideologies, there's too many people, but then they want you to
[2:19:26.920 --> 2:19:29.280]  take a shot because they love you and they care about you.
[2:19:29.280 --> 2:19:32.440]  Let's go to your calls quick now, because we've got a lot of amazing callers.
[2:19:32.440 --> 2:19:39.680]  Like one of the callers just called in, was talking about just incredible stuff about
[2:19:39.680 --> 2:19:45.000]  funeral director, husbands of funeral director, increased deaths of acts, that's what the
[2:19:45.000 --> 2:19:48.680]  National Pathologist Union in Germany said.
[2:19:48.680 --> 2:19:56.160]  They said we're seeing a doubling in cancer deaths and a doubling in heart attack deaths.
[2:19:56.160 --> 2:19:57.160]  Doubling.
[2:19:57.160 --> 2:19:59.440]  And that's what you see in the statistics, too.
[2:19:59.440 --> 2:20:03.640]  Look at the numbers we show that while I'm talking to the scholar, show that John Hopkins
[2:20:03.640 --> 2:20:07.000]  graphic again, country by country of right when they give them the shots and then what
[2:20:07.000 --> 2:20:10.160]  happens to the death, the disease, the, I mean, it's incredible, the heart attacks,
[2:20:10.160 --> 2:20:11.160]  the cancer.
[2:20:11.160 --> 2:20:12.400]  I mean, they did this on purpose.
[2:20:12.400 --> 2:20:15.760]  And what did all the top scientists say a year and a half ago before the shot started,
[2:20:15.760 --> 2:20:19.320]  they said it'll cause heart attacks and cancer, because they knew what the damn spike protein
[2:20:19.320 --> 2:20:21.640]  does.
[2:20:21.640 --> 2:20:24.560]  It's basically like cyanide in your body.
[2:20:24.560 --> 2:20:26.680]  This is just incredible.
[2:20:26.680 --> 2:20:29.680]  You see, they know the public can't admit this themselves, it's too horrifying.
[2:20:29.680 --> 2:20:30.680]  All right.
[2:20:30.680 --> 2:20:31.680]  Shut up, Jones.
[2:20:31.680 --> 2:20:32.680]  We're going to call.
[2:20:32.680 --> 2:20:34.520]  Let's talk to Robby in Florida.
[2:20:34.520 --> 2:20:35.520]  Start here about your father.
[2:20:35.520 --> 2:20:36.520]  Tell us what happened.
[2:20:36.520 --> 2:20:37.520]  Alex, you there?
[2:20:37.520 --> 2:20:38.520]  Yes, sir.
[2:20:38.520 --> 2:20:39.520]  Hey, man.
[2:20:39.520 --> 2:20:40.520]  Hey, yeah.
[2:20:40.520 --> 2:20:48.520]  So my father received his second dose of the Pfizer shot in February by June.
[2:20:48.520 --> 2:20:51.560]  He was passed away.
[2:20:51.560 --> 2:20:52.800]  They're saying it's a heart attack.
[2:20:52.800 --> 2:20:53.800]  They're saying it's a stroke.
[2:20:53.800 --> 2:20:57.760]  Honestly, they weren't sure because they'd never seen anything whenever he went in there
[2:20:57.760 --> 2:20:58.760]  like this.
[2:20:58.760 --> 2:21:02.280]  He was in a coma by the time he got in the hospital and he passed away from an acute
[2:21:02.280 --> 2:21:09.920]  myocardial infarction, to be exact, you know, looked up on the search engine, ran by a World
[2:21:09.920 --> 2:21:13.240]  Health Organization, VigieAccess.org.
[2:21:13.240 --> 2:21:18.280]  So it's verified and I get your frustration of when you say, you know, this is all this.
[2:21:18.280 --> 2:21:19.280]  We keep repeating ourselves.
[2:21:19.280 --> 2:21:21.240]  It's all talking points.
[2:21:21.240 --> 2:21:26.160]  I agree because now my father's dead and this is another talking point, so something needs
[2:21:26.160 --> 2:21:27.160]  to be done about it.
[2:21:27.160 --> 2:21:28.160]  People need to get up.
[2:21:28.160 --> 2:21:31.240]  They need to get active and really decide what they want to do.
[2:21:31.240 --> 2:21:33.560]  Quit standing in the middle of the line.
[2:21:33.560 --> 2:21:38.240]  Well, Darren McBrain put together a few months ago like a five minute video where they just
[2:21:38.240 --> 2:21:42.600]  give prominent people that died from the shot like three seconds and you're looking at hundreds
[2:21:42.600 --> 2:21:45.440]  of people that died who are prominent.
[2:21:45.440 --> 2:21:53.440]  And again, the spike protein is particularly bad in black people because of the type of
[2:21:53.440 --> 2:21:55.000]  receptor sites on their cells.
[2:21:55.000 --> 2:21:57.640]  They're just a little bit different and it just so happens.
[2:21:57.640 --> 2:22:00.920]  Look how many black people have died that are prominent after they took a shot.
[2:22:00.920 --> 2:22:01.920]  I mean, so many.
[2:22:01.920 --> 2:22:08.040]  So this is also extremely race specific because again, also look at the receptor site that
[2:22:08.040 --> 2:22:10.960]  black folks have for the HIV delivery system.
[2:22:10.960 --> 2:22:16.320]  It's a lot easier for black folks to catch HIV, this Chimera virus has the HIV delivery
[2:22:16.320 --> 2:22:17.320]  system.
[2:22:17.320 --> 2:22:21.280]  And what's incredible is we have the emails of Fauci saying, combine these four viruses
[2:22:21.280 --> 2:22:26.800]  from these animals in China that we have with the viruses we isolated with the HIV delivery
[2:22:26.800 --> 2:22:27.800]  system.
[2:22:27.800 --> 2:22:29.400]  I mean, we have him building COVID.
[2:22:29.400 --> 2:22:30.400]  It's incredible.
[2:22:30.400 --> 2:22:31.400]  Yep.
[2:22:31.400 --> 2:22:32.400]  Yep.
[2:22:32.400 --> 2:22:36.320]  And you know, I'd love to know how Colin Powell passed away because, you know, swept underneath
[2:22:36.320 --> 2:22:41.000]  the rug that he was fully vaccinated, well, if we would know the truth of how he died
[2:22:41.000 --> 2:22:44.720]  and, you know, the exact reason on, you know, the death certificate, maybe it would show
[2:22:44.720 --> 2:22:48.320]  exactly what we already know, but, you know, that's just going to be swept under the rug
[2:22:48.320 --> 2:22:49.320]  like everything else.
[2:22:49.320 --> 2:22:50.320]  Absolutely.
[2:22:50.320 --> 2:22:51.320]  God bless you, Robbie.
[2:22:51.320 --> 2:22:54.320]  And I'm really sorry about your father, but his spirit lives on forever and I'm sure,
[2:22:54.320 --> 2:22:55.320]  I should have asked him.
[2:22:55.320 --> 2:22:56.840]  I'm sure his dad thought, hey, I want to be protecting.
[2:22:56.840 --> 2:22:57.840]  I want to help people.
[2:22:57.840 --> 2:22:58.840]  I don't want people sick.
[2:22:58.840 --> 2:23:01.480]  They were told you can't spread COVID and it won't hurt you and you're going to be taking
[2:23:01.480 --> 2:23:02.480]  care of it.
[2:23:02.480 --> 2:23:04.760]  You wouldn't believe the lie because he still thought his country and his government was
[2:23:04.760 --> 2:23:07.200]  run by good people.
[2:23:07.200 --> 2:23:10.640]  We always had some bad people, but now it's run by all bad people at the top or people
[2:23:10.640 --> 2:23:14.120]  that are scared because yeah, they come after you.
[2:23:14.120 --> 2:23:15.960]  Your bank account, your life, they sue you.
[2:23:15.960 --> 2:23:16.960]  They try to kill you.
[2:23:16.960 --> 2:23:18.600]  But I mean, they're already killing everybody.
[2:23:18.600 --> 2:23:19.600]  So I'm not scared at all.
[2:23:19.600 --> 2:23:20.600]  But they do to me.
[2:23:20.600 --> 2:23:22.120]  Like I'm super alive right now.
[2:23:22.120 --> 2:23:25.160]  I've never been this alive and it's not because I'm a thrill seeker.
[2:23:25.160 --> 2:23:26.400]  I don't jump out of airplanes.
[2:23:26.400 --> 2:23:30.920]  I don't rock climb a bunch of stuff because I'm into, you know, daredevil stuff.
[2:23:30.920 --> 2:23:34.320]  But if I got to do something and people are doing something evil, I'm going to go up
[2:23:34.320 --> 2:23:36.680]  against them and I don't have any fear of them.
[2:23:36.680 --> 2:23:39.480]  I got fear of letting them win.
[2:23:39.480 --> 2:23:42.040]  I just wouldn't even call that emotion fear.
[2:23:42.040 --> 2:23:47.280]  It is more of a fiery, explosive drive.
[2:23:47.280 --> 2:23:50.840]  Let's talk to another person whose father died and we'll go to Chelsea in Tennessee.
[2:23:50.840 --> 2:23:52.840]  Grant, very sad to hear about your father.
[2:23:52.840 --> 2:23:53.840]  Tell us what happened.
[2:23:53.840 --> 2:23:54.840]  Grant from California.
[2:23:54.840 --> 2:23:55.840]  Thank you, Alex.
[2:23:55.840 --> 2:24:03.840]  First, I want to say Godspeed to you, to Owen, to your amazing crew.
[2:24:03.840 --> 2:24:07.120]  Who's doing incredible work.
[2:24:07.120 --> 2:24:12.880]  Yeah, I buried my father yesterday morning.
[2:24:12.880 --> 2:24:14.920]  He was murdered.
[2:24:14.920 --> 2:24:17.840]  He was murdered by the shots.
[2:24:17.840 --> 2:24:24.280]  He was living with my sister in Israel who fought me tooth and nail.
[2:24:24.280 --> 2:24:33.400]  I had signed a power attorney to her because she was living with my father who was having
[2:24:33.400 --> 2:24:37.640]  Alzheimer's problems.
[2:24:37.640 --> 2:24:39.320]  And I regret doing it now.
[2:24:39.320 --> 2:24:46.920]  The one thing I told her is, I said to her, I absolutely do not want him to get any of
[2:24:46.920 --> 2:24:47.920]  these shots.
[2:24:47.920 --> 2:24:50.120]  I said, you want to do it?
[2:24:50.120 --> 2:24:52.480]  That's your choice for yourself.
[2:24:52.480 --> 2:24:54.680]  But he's my father as well.
[2:24:54.680 --> 2:25:00.600]  And I do not want him to get these shots under any condition.
[2:25:00.600 --> 2:25:04.440]  Well, she went ahead and she did it anyway.
[2:25:04.440 --> 2:25:08.280]  And his physical condition got worse.
[2:25:08.280 --> 2:25:09.880]  She kept reporting.
[2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:15.040]  I insisted that she tell me what the doctors say, what the tests say.
[2:25:15.040 --> 2:25:23.280]  And every time she would relate information about the test, these were classic symptoms
[2:25:23.280 --> 2:25:30.760]  that you reported from your interviews with Sherry Tenpenny and all the other great people
[2:25:30.760 --> 2:25:37.520]  about what they found after doing blood tests with people.
[2:25:37.520 --> 2:25:42.240]  They were in the blood sites that were published online.
[2:25:42.240 --> 2:25:46.680]  And I knew this was going to happen.
[2:25:46.680 --> 2:25:51.560]  But it's an entirely different thing to know and what it actually happens.
[2:25:51.560 --> 2:25:56.960]  Well, in fact, they know that over 65% of people worldwide, it's the same number keeps
[2:25:56.960 --> 2:26:03.280]  popping up, that take the Pfizer, get a D-dimer test, meaning they have blood clots.
[2:26:03.280 --> 2:26:05.000]  And then it's even higher with Moderna.
[2:26:05.000 --> 2:26:07.960]  It's over 80% of people that take the Moderna.
[2:26:07.960 --> 2:26:08.960]  It's the really bad one.
[2:26:08.960 --> 2:26:10.960]  That's the one Bill Gates totally controls.
[2:26:10.960 --> 2:26:12.160]  They take that one.
[2:26:12.160 --> 2:26:15.400]  What injection did they give your father?
[2:26:15.400 --> 2:26:16.720]  She didn't tell me.
[2:26:16.720 --> 2:26:20.480]  And a lot of people who get these injections, when you ask them, which shot you could take,
[2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:22.240]  they don't even know.
[2:26:22.240 --> 2:26:32.400]  You know what the true hallmark of stupidity in people is not that they don't know.
[2:26:32.400 --> 2:26:35.520]  It's that they refuse to know.
[2:26:35.520 --> 2:26:40.640]  You send them the information to say, look, check the information.
[2:26:40.640 --> 2:26:41.640]  You're right.
[2:26:41.640 --> 2:26:42.640]  Listen, we're out of time.
[2:26:42.640 --> 2:26:43.640]  God bless you.
[2:26:43.640 --> 2:26:44.640]  I'm sorry for your father.
[2:26:44.640 --> 2:26:45.640]  Thanks for sharing that testimony.
[2:26:45.640 --> 2:26:46.640]  It may save other lives.
[2:26:46.640 --> 2:26:52.480]  Mr. Phil's stupid now, or is she emboldened?
[2:26:52.480 --> 2:26:53.480]  He's gone.
[2:26:53.480 --> 2:26:57.040]  A lot of folks, once they kill their family members inadvertently, they still want to
[2:26:57.040 --> 2:26:58.040]  admit they're wrongs.
[2:26:58.040 --> 2:26:59.040]  They can't face the truth.
[2:26:59.040 --> 2:27:00.040]  Thank you for the call, sir.
[2:27:00.040 --> 2:27:01.040]  All right.
[2:27:01.040 --> 2:27:02.040]  We're going to come right back with Chelsea.
[2:27:02.040 --> 2:27:03.040]  Husband's a funeral director.
[2:27:03.040 --> 2:27:04.040]  Stay with us.
[2:27:04.040 --> 2:27:08.440]  We'll be right back.
[2:27:08.440 --> 2:27:12.280]  If you're concerned about the power grid and want to generate your own supply of off-grid
[2:27:12.280 --> 2:27:17.000]  electricity, this will be the most important message you'll hear this year.
[2:27:17.000 --> 2:27:18.000]  Here's why.
[2:27:18.000 --> 2:27:21.960]  We now have a small number of solar generators back in stock.
[2:27:21.960 --> 2:27:27.000]  These emergency backup systems provide life-saving backup power when you need it most.
[2:27:27.000 --> 2:27:32.160]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly, emit no dangerous fumes, and
[2:27:32.160 --> 2:27:36.080]  produce an endless supply of free electricity from the sun.
[2:27:36.080 --> 2:27:40.000]  Whether it's wildfires, dangerous weather, power grid issues, or just getting off the
[2:27:40.000 --> 2:27:44.720]  grid, you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again.
[2:27:44.720 --> 2:27:50.040]  Even better, all this week, radio listeners get over $700 in free off-the-grid bonuses
[2:27:50.040 --> 2:27:51.040]  too.
[2:27:51.040 --> 2:27:54.680]  Go to mysolarbackup.com to learn more and check availability.
[2:27:54.680 --> 2:27:56.640]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:28:01.280]  Look for the free report, Crisis Cooling, how to make absolutely sure your meat, milk, and
[2:28:01.280 --> 2:28:05.120]  medicines stay safe and cool in any power outage.
[2:28:05.120 --> 2:28:07.080]  Yours free at mysolarbackup.com.
[2:28:07.080 --> 2:28:16.200]  At the time of cutting this announcement, it is the morning of Sunday, October 17th.
[2:28:16.200 --> 2:28:25.560]  And that means there is less than 48 hours left to take advantage of our emergency mega-blow
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:31.240]  out sale that is tied directly to these supply chain breakdowns happening across the world
[2:28:31.240 --> 2:28:33.920]  by design for the Great Reset.
[2:28:33.920 --> 2:28:38.240]  The central banks attempt to bankrupt the mainline economy, to consolidate it, then to
[2:28:38.240 --> 2:28:44.200]  move in with the quadrillions of fake currency they have to buy up what's left of the infrastructure
[2:28:44.200 --> 2:28:46.200]  that they don't already control.
[2:28:46.200 --> 2:28:48.480]  This is economic warfare.
[2:28:48.480 --> 2:28:52.800]  And so, InfoWars is under attack like every other pro-American independent organization
[2:28:52.800 --> 2:28:54.520]  and we need funding.
[2:28:54.520 --> 2:28:57.800]  And so, despite the fact we're running out of a lot of our best selling products, I'm
[2:28:57.800 --> 2:29:02.160]  still offering them at huge sale prices because I need to move them out to get the capital
[2:29:02.160 --> 2:29:03.160]  in.
[2:29:03.160 --> 2:29:09.000]  And so, with the advantage of this sale, it's only running until Monday night at infowarstore.com.
[2:29:33.400 --> 2:29:42.720]  And so, with the advantage of this sale, it's only running until Monday night at infowarstore.com.
[2:29:42.720 --> 2:29:53.080]  And so, with the advantage of this sale, it's only running until Monday night at infowarstore.com.
[2:29:53.080 --> 2:30:09.560]  That's InfoWars, store.com.
[2:30:09.560 --> 2:30:18.240]  InfoWars emergency supply chain breakdown sale is only running for one week from Monday,
[2:30:18.240 --> 2:30:21.640]  October 11th for seven days.
[2:30:21.640 --> 2:30:27.240]  That's because a bunch of these products that we have in stock are limited supply because
[2:30:27.240 --> 2:30:32.840]  obviously the supply chain breakdown that I've been warning you of now for 20 months because
[2:30:32.840 --> 2:30:36.680]  that's part of the great reset and part of the global's plan and that's what global lockdowns
[2:30:36.680 --> 2:30:37.680]  have been triggered.
[2:30:37.680 --> 2:30:41.320]  So we've not lowered the quality of any of our products, that means some of them have
[2:30:41.320 --> 2:30:45.240]  been sold out more than six months like DNA Force Plus.
[2:30:45.240 --> 2:30:50.120]  It is 40% off but coming up in one week it will go back to full price and we probably
[2:30:50.120 --> 2:30:54.040]  won't have more for up to six months, ladies and gentlemen.
[2:30:54.040 --> 2:30:57.520]  So it's a chance to support the broadcast, get incredible products at the same time.
[2:30:57.520 --> 2:31:02.600]  Winner, Sun, Ultra 12, they're both 50% off, they're going to go back to 10% off in a week
[2:31:02.600 --> 2:31:04.920]  as well, they're 50% off right now.

[2:31:38.660 --> 2:31:48.820]  See, they just want to slip in that, oh your cell phone does listen to you even when you
[2:31:48.820 --> 2:31:52.540]  don't want it to, oh that home assistant is watching and listening to you and they are
[2:31:52.540 --> 2:31:58.420]  calling them now into court as a witness against you, everything's being recorded, oh we do
[2:31:58.420 --> 2:32:02.380]  want to promote pedophilia, oh we do want to promote open borders and world government.
[2:32:02.380 --> 2:32:06.820]  And now the new article by Kit Daniels on InfoWars.com, I called Kit this morning and
[2:32:06.820 --> 2:32:12.180]  I said Kit, you're an awesome writer, a great researcher, I said, I called him like 7AM,
[2:32:12.180 --> 2:32:18.740]  he picked up, I said Kit, you notice, if you do a search, nobody's talking about the Big
[2:32:18.740 --> 2:32:25.180]  Davos announcement last week, all they're talking about is the announcement that if
[2:32:25.180 --> 2:32:31.180]  you want to travel, you'll have to give blood each time to a new testing system that puts
[2:32:31.180 --> 2:32:36.660]  you in a database that Bill Gates and George Soros own, I mean that's not in the article
[2:32:36.660 --> 2:32:38.220]  but that's who owns it.
[2:32:38.220 --> 2:32:42.140]  They go get the UN to approve it, the UN's now the world government, it says that that
[2:32:42.140 --> 2:32:48.420]  needs to happen, the corporations that implement what the UN says.
[2:32:48.420 --> 2:32:54.860]  Think about that, since when does American Airlines or United Airlines or Delta get
[2:32:54.860 --> 2:33:02.780]  run by the UN, well since Congress lets them, taking over our policy, but the media focused
[2:33:02.780 --> 2:33:09.900]  on the blood, not that the UN standardized, put out its guidelines, matching what Davos
[2:33:09.900 --> 2:33:18.060]  already created and then the corporations roll out their new world ID and it's in everybody's
[2:33:18.060 --> 2:33:24.460]  face, what is this we're putting on screen, I just don't know what this is, oh it's people
[2:33:24.460 --> 2:33:28.540]  protesting Southwest Airlines and trying to make them take the poison shots and notice
[2:33:28.540 --> 2:33:32.260]  we're starting to win that fight because we stand up and take action, that's what it's
[2:33:32.260 --> 2:33:37.380]  all about but getting back to what I was heading on here, I'm going to go back to your calls,
[2:33:37.380 --> 2:33:44.820]  it's just that this is it, this is the enslavement, this is the surveillance, this is the control
[2:33:44.820 --> 2:33:48.860]  and they admit if we don't like what you do politically we're going to just turn your
[2:33:48.860 --> 2:33:52.340]  phone off, we're going to turn your tracker system off, we're going to turn your chip
[2:33:52.340 --> 2:33:58.140]  off, we're going to turn your face scan off and we're going to totally bankrupt you and
[2:33:58.140 --> 2:34:04.820]  then put you in a reeducation camp and they even use the term reeducation camp, don't
[2:34:04.820 --> 2:34:12.620]  believe me type in, Obama army document, reeducation camp, you'll be on the army's website and
[2:34:12.620 --> 2:34:18.260]  they opened and have prepared reeducation camps for Americans even using the Soviet
[2:34:18.260 --> 2:34:26.900]  Chai Kham term reeducation camp, that's a communist term, army manual for reeducation
[2:34:26.900 --> 2:34:32.180]  camps applies to US citizens, there it is, you broke that in 2012, people couldn't believe
[2:34:32.180 --> 2:34:37.100]  it, the army sent us that when it was secret, people thought we made a fake document, the
[2:34:37.100 --> 2:34:46.100]  army just quietly released it 11 months later, yeah, they didn't even care if I told people
[2:34:46.100 --> 2:34:52.620]  long as I didn't say who they were, I was given that by army psiops at Fort Hood because
[2:34:52.620 --> 2:34:56.620]  they built a reeducation camp out there, think they're a little pissed off about that but
[2:34:56.620 --> 2:35:01.780]  those people are all long gone, they got woke people in the army now baby, they ready to
[2:35:01.780 --> 2:35:07.900]  put you in a FEMA camp, okay, let's go back to your calls, I apologize I'm ranting, it's
[2:35:07.900 --> 2:35:12.060]  just such incredible news, Chelsea in Tennessee, thanks for holding, tell us about your husband
[2:35:12.060 --> 2:35:17.500]  who's a funeral director and what he's witnessing, hey, yeah, hey Alex, nice to meet you over
[2:35:17.500 --> 2:35:24.180]  the phone, thank you, yeah, so my husband has been in the industry for very long time
[2:35:24.180 --> 2:35:31.300]  and the last like eight months has been extremely abnormal for the time of year, usually in
[2:35:31.300 --> 2:35:35.180]  the warmer months it's not older people that passed away, it's younger because they're
[2:35:35.180 --> 2:35:42.860]  outside, they're active, there's accidents, well he has been probably a 60% increase in
[2:35:42.860 --> 2:35:53.100]  older people passing since I'd say April and pretty much 95% of them are vaccinated
[2:35:53.100 --> 2:35:58.820]  and if they're not vaccinated and even if they didn't have COVID when they passed, they're
[2:35:58.820 --> 2:36:04.540]  required to put COVID on the death certificate because the doctors know to sign off on it
[2:36:04.540 --> 2:36:12.140]  when it hits their death, so in the very beginning of all of this, he was told that unless it's
[2:36:12.140 --> 2:36:17.380]  a, well I say he, him isn't like the whole funeral home as well, we're told that if it's
[2:36:17.380 --> 2:36:22.540]  not a homicide or like a blatant homicide or something like that that they're required
[2:36:22.540 --> 2:36:28.020]  to put COVID as the cause of death, so that's been going on since the beginning, but then
[2:36:28.020 --> 2:36:35.700]  this summer he, like I said he has seen probably a 60% increase in the ages of like 60 to 75
[2:36:35.700 --> 2:36:37.420]  people passing.
[2:36:37.420 --> 2:36:42.620]  Well ma'am, I would like you if you don't mind to get your name and number off air,
[2:36:42.620 --> 2:36:47.740]  we won't say who your husband is but I'd like to, I believe you but we do this as journalists
[2:36:47.740 --> 2:36:52.820]  when we do interviews, verify where he works, what he does and then have him on incognito
[2:36:52.820 --> 2:36:57.260]  like Project Veritas would do to talk about what he witnesses or what he sees.
[2:36:57.260 --> 2:37:00.820]  Now if he's the owner, he might want to say his name but that's up to him, but this is
[2:37:00.820 --> 2:37:08.100]  exactly what the German epidemiology society came out and said but also not just the epidemiology
[2:37:08.100 --> 2:37:14.820]  then their other big union came out, the coroner's union or the pathologist's union and similar
[2:37:14.820 --> 2:37:19.580]  things with large national unions in Japan came out and said the same thing.
[2:37:19.580 --> 2:37:26.020]  So yeah, grand county coroner raises concerns over deaths among COVID cases and yeah I know
[2:37:26.020 --> 2:37:29.940]  a lot of medical doctors personally that are quitting at hospitals and places they work
[2:37:29.940 --> 2:37:33.380]  and going and starting their own clinics but they're not ready to go public until they've
[2:37:33.380 --> 2:37:35.860]  got their new clinic started and then they're going to go public as they make them sign
[2:37:35.860 --> 2:37:40.580]  on disclosures where they're told we know the shots are killing a bunch of people just
[2:37:40.580 --> 2:37:44.860]  like the Project Veritas nurses and doctors showed, we're not going to tell people it's
[2:37:44.860 --> 2:37:49.500]  COVID vaccine killing them, we're going to tell them it's COVID and so yeah and the hospitals
[2:37:49.500 --> 2:37:56.740]  are being recorded by the managers who are just corporate operatives to not tell people
[2:37:56.740 --> 2:38:00.100]  so they're now getting you involved in the killing, isn't that incredible?
[2:38:00.100 --> 2:38:02.100]  What else does your husband say about this?
[2:38:02.100 --> 2:38:07.340]  So basically it's just it's unlike anything he's ever seen, he's been in the industry
[2:38:07.340 --> 2:38:13.580]  for almost 20 years now, started out like as an apprentice at 19 years old so it's just
[2:38:13.580 --> 2:38:17.180]  it's unlike anything he's seen, it's a lot of line, he's even felt like you know the
[2:38:17.180 --> 2:38:22.540]  company he works for has kind of called him to be somewhat unethical, thankfully they're
[2:38:22.540 --> 2:38:27.220]  not mandating the vaccine because I think they're seeing what's happening so they're
[2:38:27.220 --> 2:38:31.300]  not mandating in their employees but they're still requiring their employees to follow
[2:38:31.300 --> 2:38:35.540]  the procedures and protocols that we know to be unethical.
[2:38:35.540 --> 2:38:42.100]  He had a family a little over a year ago, the gentleman committed suicide, he did hop
[2:38:42.100 --> 2:38:47.260]  further at the time of the suicide and my husband was required to put down COVID as the
[2:38:47.260 --> 2:38:52.620]  cause of death and similar thing he had a family where the person died in a car accident
[2:38:52.620 --> 2:38:59.260]  COVID, he had to put COVID down as the cause of death so it's crazy, he's been seeing it
[2:38:59.260 --> 2:39:04.020]  since the beginning of it, the numbers are so far skewed, it's not even it's not even
[2:39:04.020 --> 2:39:12.060]  funny, one lady, she was like in her 80s, she had cancer, had COVID, survived it, passed
[2:39:12.060 --> 2:39:17.740]  away six months later, what do you think they put down as the cause of death, COVID.
[2:39:17.740 --> 2:39:23.780]  So it's just it's unlike anything I've ever seen, he's ever seen before and just like
[2:39:23.780 --> 2:39:27.860]  you said it's surprising people to want to get out of the industries they're in especially
[2:39:27.860 --> 2:39:31.460]  you know if they're Christians and want to do the right thing and that's kind of where
[2:39:31.460 --> 2:39:37.580]  he's at, I didn't have a friend who's a nurse in Nashville and she's about to quit her
[2:39:37.580 --> 2:39:42.860]  job, she's on maternity leave now, so when she gets done she's quitting because she's
[2:39:42.860 --> 2:39:48.180]  bought out told me they're killing people at the hospital she works at, so it's it's
[2:39:48.180 --> 2:39:52.140]  breaking into a lot of professions and a lot of industries.
[2:39:52.140 --> 2:39:58.260]  Well they call it uncommon, I personally know it's more than 50 people that have lost loved
[2:39:58.260 --> 2:40:02.540]  ones, young and old after they took the shots, it's always blood clots, heart attacks, cancers
[2:40:02.540 --> 2:40:09.900]  and then I know hundreds of people who's themselves or family like Roger Stone's wife took the
[2:40:09.900 --> 2:40:14.260]  Pfizer shot, took the second one and three weeks later got a big tumor under her arm
[2:40:14.260 --> 2:40:19.140]  and they said yeah it's the vaccine, I mean this is not a vaccine, this is a death shot
[2:40:19.140 --> 2:40:24.740]  as Dr. Zelenko says, well ma'am God bless you, I'm going to put you on hold and if you'd
[2:40:24.740 --> 2:40:28.300]  like to get us in contact with your husband off record we'd love to interview him on
[2:40:28.300 --> 2:40:31.780]  air, we won't say where you're from or where you're at, we'd like you to you know talk

[2:40:56.820 --> 2:41:00.740]  we'll be right back with more calls a bunch of other crazy stuff they want to bring up
[2:41:00.740 --> 2:41:04.620]  big brother doesn't want this herd they hate this show existing they're hopping man because

[2:42:15.740 --> 2:42:23.900]  that means there is less than 48 hours left to take advantage of our emergency mega blowout
[2:42:23.900 --> 2:42:29.340]  sale that is tied directly to these supply chain breakdowns happening across the world
[2:42:29.340 --> 2:42:35.180]  by design for the gray reset as the central banks attempt to bankrupt the main line economy
[2:42:35.180 --> 2:42:41.340]  to consolidate it and to move in with the quadrillions of fake currency they have to buy up what's
[2:42:41.340 --> 2:42:46.620]  left of the infrastructure that they don't already control this is economic warfare and
[2:42:46.620 --> 2:42:51.060]  so info war is under attack like every other pro-american independent organization and
[2:42:51.060 --> 2:42:55.700]  we need funding and so despite the fact we're running out of a lot of our best selling products
[2:42:55.700 --> 2:43:00.260]  i'm still offering them at huge sale prices because i need to move them out in the capital
[2:43:00.260 --> 2:43:08.940]  in so take advantage of this sale it's only running until monday night at infowarstore.com
[2:43:08.940 --> 2:43:13.700]  it was almost 15 years ago that i released my seminal film in game blueprint for global
[2:43:13.700 --> 2:43:19.380]  enslavement and in that documentary i predicted the globalist would establish world government
[2:43:19.380 --> 2:43:24.860]  a releasing of virus demanding that there be worldwide lockdowns and then triggering a
[2:43:24.860 --> 2:43:29.700]  collapse of our industrial society and now they've done it how did i know they would
[2:43:29.700 --> 2:43:34.860]  do it because they wrote books and white papers and many of their own reports and internal
[2:43:34.860 --> 2:43:39.980]  meetings were leaked you see then i was tracking the builder bird group who's head at the time
[2:43:39.980 --> 2:43:45.420]  was claus schwa and our sources in cyber confirming to us that they were indeed planning to launch
[2:43:45.420 --> 2:43:49.980]  this gray reset well we're now living in it the purposeful collapse of the third world
[2:43:49.980 --> 2:43:55.340]  and the first world on its ass is a tyrannical corporate world government the total censorship
[2:43:55.340 --> 2:44:01.740]  no due process destruction of the family and then incrementally more and more deadly injections
[2:44:01.740 --> 2:44:06.540]  of poison mass creating these vaccines to poison us in the populace this is what info
[2:44:06.540 --> 2:44:12.260]  wars is fighting we're fighting for the future info wars emergency supply chain breakdown
[2:44:12.260 --> 2:44:21.420]  sale is only running for one week from monday october 11th for seven days that's because
[2:44:21.420 --> 2:44:27.540]  a bunch of these products that we have in stock are limited supply because obviously
[2:44:27.540 --> 2:44:32.500]  the supply chain breakdown that i've been warning you of now for 20 months because that's part
[2:44:32.500 --> 2:44:36.180]  of the gray reset and part of the globalist plan that's what global lockdowns would then
[2:44:36.180 --> 2:44:40.460]  trigger so we've not lowered the quality of any of our products that means some of them
[2:44:40.460 --> 2:44:47.060]  have been sold out more than six months like dna force plus it is 40% off but coming up

[2:45:52.460 --> 2:45:56.060]  and calls and time to really talk about things and get your testimony out there to millions
[2:45:56.060 --> 2:46:01.020]  of people believe me you're having a big effect doing that and a lot of times i feel even
[2:46:01.020 --> 2:46:05.380]  dirty just being on air talking about all this evil when at a certain point i like we
[2:46:05.380 --> 2:46:10.260]  better march on these folks but you got a bunch of dumb down people in the bureaucracy they'll
[2:46:10.260 --> 2:46:14.580]  think we're attacking them they're not educated on the globalist takeover now these corporations
[2:46:14.580 --> 2:46:19.060]  control our government yet and so we've got to get the public educated before we can bring
[2:46:19.060 --> 2:46:24.580]  these globalists to justice and as bad as i feel just talking about it and just protesting
[2:46:24.580 --> 2:46:28.820]  and you know the rest of it and i follow a lot of lawsuits on the globalist and add some
[2:46:28.820 --> 2:46:33.380]  success imagine the other people that know this and decide to not even talk or not even
[2:46:33.380 --> 2:46:38.740]  call in or not even warn anybody the bottom line is they're pissed because of therapeutics
[2:46:38.740 --> 2:46:46.860]  you've been telling people about zinc and d3 and vitamin c and iodine and all these things
[2:46:46.860 --> 2:46:50.260]  that boost your immune system you've been telling folks about ivermectin and all these
[2:46:50.260 --> 2:46:53.700]  things that that's why they're so angry because they are not able to get the death toll they
[2:46:53.700 --> 2:46:58.780]  wanted they're just getting the death toll from their poisoned shots it's a very very
[2:46:58.780 --> 2:47:03.740]  incredible time to be alive right now but believe me you calling and telling your stories about
[2:47:03.740 --> 2:47:06.940]  how you lost loved ones and things that's waking people up that's changing the narrative
[2:47:06.940 --> 2:47:12.580]  so thank you for taking something evil and and like god does through you transmuting
[2:47:12.580 --> 2:47:17.180]  good out of that evil that's what god does okay let's go back to your calls who's been
[2:47:17.180 --> 2:47:23.460]  holding the longest here is it controlled demolition or is it info warrior it's controlled demolition

[2:47:29.300 --> 2:47:36.100]  too hey listen man we went to a taping of the mike huckabee show recently here in tennessee
[2:47:36.100 --> 2:47:43.700]  and it was a great show but he he had on a lieutenant governor on that was from arkansas
[2:47:43.700 --> 2:47:49.380]  and they were talking about their opinion on the vaccination and mike huckabee said well
[2:47:49.380 --> 2:47:54.740]  uh you know i went ahead and got the vaccination because that's what my doctor recommended and
[2:47:54.740 --> 2:48:00.500]  uh but then before that he was challenging dr fouchy on you know he was bringing up points
[2:48:00.500 --> 2:48:05.940]  about not not to listen to dr fouchy but i just thought it was incredible that you know
[2:48:05.940 --> 2:48:10.460]  just like rand paul he can't just come out against it and just stand up like you've been
[2:48:10.460 --> 2:48:16.300]  doing the whole time well look huckabee is very well spoken and comes off as a great
[2:48:16.300 --> 2:48:20.220]  guy and i know my friend check norris loves him and says he's the best guy ever but huckabee
[2:48:20.220 --> 2:48:24.540]  was even for force inoculations of children they still buy into the medical system and
[2:48:24.540 --> 2:48:29.940]  trust the doctors it's not doctors making the decisions it's bill gates and the un and
[2:48:29.940 --> 2:48:35.420]  the globalist and so trump made the same mistake of trusting the system not realizing that it's
[2:48:35.420 --> 2:48:40.300]  that matter trusting millie and thinking depending on leaders or patriots they're not the bad
[2:48:40.300 --> 2:48:44.620]  guys have been put in all the major positions here's an example this just came out john robert
[2:48:44.620 --> 2:48:50.620]  slammed for deleting tweet claiming death of colin powell raised new concerns about vaccines
[2:48:50.620 --> 2:48:56.580]  well yeah how do you die a coveted if the vaccine doesn't work or did the vaccine killing
[2:48:56.580 --> 2:49:01.460]  which we already know it's linked to so then he gets scared and deletes that and now he's
[2:49:01.460 --> 2:49:06.500]  under fire for that because you're not supposed to criticize the shots i bless you thanks

[2:51:07.300 --> 2:51:11.220]  six so they're making such a big deal about it exaggerating and calling it the worst thing
[2:51:11.220 --> 2:51:15.940]  in u.s history and other prepositors crap is they're scared of us marching peacefully
[2:51:16.900 --> 2:51:21.220]  they want to demonize the million people that showed up peacefully using the few hundred
[2:51:21.220 --> 2:51:25.700]  that were violent and the few hundred others that got waved in by police and that video
[2:51:27.060 --> 2:51:31.460]  will be on the war room today it's 40 minutes it just came out on one of the court cases they've
[2:51:31.460 --> 2:51:35.460]  got you've heard 12 000 hours of footage from the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cameras
[2:51:35.460 --> 2:51:39.860]  in there from that day they just released 40 something minutes and i was watching it during
[2:51:39.860 --> 2:51:46.500]  the break it's police opening doors for people and waving them in new capital video contradicts
[2:51:46.500 --> 2:51:51.860]  justice department's media narrative on january six we're getting that article up on info wars.com
[2:51:51.860 --> 2:51:56.900]  but it is incredible and i mean i was looking at 40 minutes i was just scanning through it it was
[2:51:56.900 --> 2:52:01.140]  just like them waving them in them open the doors them telling them go in and these are people
[2:52:01.140 --> 2:52:06.100]  charged who just didn't even know what was going on others broke in then they ordered the police to
[2:52:06.100 --> 2:52:11.940]  stand down they walk in peacefully and again this is just some of the footage some of the footage
[2:52:11.940 --> 2:52:16.900]  i saw is them opening the doors for them i mean wow and these people some of these people are still
[2:52:16.900 --> 2:52:23.060]  in jail when democrats burned down buildings and then the vice president when she was running

[2:53:04.180 --> 2:53:13.540]  nato because in the month of july august nato established its first ueber command center
[2:53:13.540 --> 2:53:23.220]  on us soil in virginia in a midst of all that's going on nato comes over here and supposedly has

[2:54:24.580 --> 2:54:30.260]  is interfacing these devices with biological systems will offer new treatment methods for
[2:54:30.260 --> 2:54:37.060]  neurological diseases but it will improve interface mechanism between the brain and electronic
[2:54:37.060 --> 2:54:42.580]  devices for better control that's right in fact sir i've been to get to this today and i'm glad
[2:54:42.580 --> 2:54:46.340]  you called i get so busy i didn't i'm going to shoot a special report on this i promise because
[2:54:46.340 --> 2:54:51.380]  it's so important i was always told by the top experts and even people that have been inside
[2:54:51.380 --> 2:54:55.540]  the british government the u.s. government the highest levels that nato is going to be the head
[2:54:55.540 --> 2:55:00.980]  of the world government nato runs the child kidnapping nato runs the drugs and nato runs the
[2:55:00.980 --> 2:55:07.300]  u.n. and nato's behind the u.n. and nato is what's already taken over the u.s. and ran the coup and
[2:55:07.300 --> 2:55:12.180]  ran the coup against trump and ran the election fraud and so really the only power centers now
[2:55:12.180 --> 2:55:18.100]  is nato china and russia those are the three power structures now america is basically in the eyes
[2:55:18.100 --> 2:55:22.900]  of globalists is conquered and is done their challenge is bankrupting us and mopping us up in
[2:55:22.900 --> 2:55:28.660]  their views i would agree with that i would definitely agree with that but you know what
[2:55:28.660 --> 2:55:34.820]  nato's here because it even talks about on places of crisis where they will go and what they will
[2:55:34.820 --> 2:55:39.380]  do absolutely no i mean it's going to be not un trips that take over america but nato trips
[2:55:40.180 --> 2:55:44.180]  and the un's in charge of everything else god bless you powerful call glad he held for that
[2:55:44.180 --> 2:55:52.340]  all right i'm getting to everybody i'm getting to john in california tim in washington and other

[2:56:00.740 --> 2:56:07.460]  globalist hate you so much why do they hate america so much because it's an idea of freedom that their
[2:56:07.460 --> 2:56:14.180]  tyrannical system that they're pushing cannot coexist with it's very very simple for their world
[2:56:14.180 --> 2:56:20.980]  government their anti-human post-human eugenics system to flourish freedom and liberty and due
[2:56:20.980 --> 2:56:27.700]  process injustice and god-fearing systems must fail so sure you didn't start a fight with bill
[2:56:27.700 --> 2:56:33.380]  gates you didn't start a fight with david rockefeller you didn't start a fight with the un
[2:56:33.380 --> 2:56:39.460]  they started a fight with you and they're not gonna back down and they're not gonna go away
[2:56:39.460 --> 2:56:45.460]  and they're not going to ever stop their attacks until they have the fear of god put into them
[2:56:45.460 --> 2:56:49.700]  but the average person still doesn't even know about the new world order or about globalism
[2:56:49.700 --> 2:56:54.740]  or about corporate fascism and it's not until people understand that and that we're under attack

[3:00:35.540 --> 3:00:41.460]  i'm tired of everybody just thinking that we're going to go ahead and you know a parade of flags
[3:00:41.460 --> 3:00:46.100]  and everything's going to change us this is the devil that we're fighting against so again the
[3:00:46.100 --> 3:00:50.740]  time machine we're going to go back to 1925 we're going to we're going to find the dragon what will
[3:00:50.740 --> 3:00:55.940]  we do chop the head off or do you think that we'd have you know flags and and and marching and and
[3:00:56.820 --> 3:01:03.540]  you know religious talk finally where are the black ops guys where are the green berets where
[3:01:03.540 --> 3:01:08.580]  are all the guys that are you know with the with the ball how many people do you think that they're
[3:01:08.580 --> 3:01:14.740]  already in this whole situation alex 50 people 100 really about that well absolutely i mean i'll
[3:01:14.740 --> 3:01:23.700]  tell you that the the the the media sells the idea hollywood that soldiers and and even your
[3:01:23.700 --> 3:01:28.580]  non-commissioned officers and officers run things kernels don't run anything regular generals don't
[3:01:28.580 --> 3:01:34.660]  run anything it's all the bureaucrats above it and the policy makers and the un and these world
[3:01:34.660 --> 3:01:41.060]  councils like the cfr the royal commissions all those they create the policy and then it's implemented
[3:01:41.060 --> 3:01:45.140]  that's why you read one nato document you've read the you know you've read the rest it's all the same
[3:01:45.140 --> 3:01:48.980]  thing we're going to put chips in your brain we're going to take you over we're going to dominate
[3:01:48.980 --> 3:01:54.180]  you and control you and and we're going to use everybody as assets of this new system i mean
[3:01:54.180 --> 3:01:58.980]  they literally say we are capturing your country you will no longer have any authority you will
[3:01:58.980 --> 3:02:04.340]  own nothing you will have nothing so it's a declaration of total war and if you go along
[3:02:04.340 --> 3:02:09.860]  with it as an executive you get the mansion you get the you know the the mercedes benzine play golf
[3:02:09.860 --> 3:02:15.540]  all day so where are these guys well why can't someone secretly go chop the head off well i mean
[3:02:19.300 --> 3:02:23.060]  you know there's not a lot of people that are motivated to do things like that and i first
[3:02:23.060 --> 3:02:27.140]  you got to identify these people and i'm not calling for any violence i've snuck into bohemian
[3:02:27.140 --> 3:02:31.700]  grove most people there aren't bad most of them are just people being indoctrinated and brought
[3:02:31.700 --> 3:02:37.540]  into the occult it's very you know incremental um and and it's just i mean i've snuck in and
[3:02:37.540 --> 3:02:40.580]  covered bilderberg i've been in the building when it's already going and they've caught me and
[3:02:40.580 --> 3:02:46.420]  thrown me out when the king of spain's walking by i mean so we it was guarded by marines and
[3:02:46.420 --> 3:02:50.980]  secret service so even if i wanted to do something it wouldn't have gone well what i'd been able to
[3:02:50.980 --> 3:02:55.060]  take one of them out i wouldn't do that by the way i wasn't i was there as a journalist but
[3:02:55.060 --> 3:03:00.340]  this is real stuff to talk about it's not like we need somebody else to go out and take somebody
[3:03:00.340 --> 3:03:04.660]  out we need to expose it it's a spiritual issue we have to deal with we have to politically then
[3:03:04.660 --> 3:03:08.420]  take back our systems and then fix it that way and prosecute these people
[3:03:11.620 --> 3:03:22.340]  if you only knew the power of the dark side join bill gates and together we will defeat humanity
[3:03:23.620 --> 3:03:32.580]  then our gods will reward us with eternal life that's basically the ethos of the globalists
[3:03:32.580 --> 3:03:40.340]  they must first play god they must first prove that they are the fittest in their social
[3:03:40.340 --> 3:03:46.660]  Darwinistic system and in a way they're right if we let them lie to us and dumb us down and poison us
[3:03:46.660 --> 3:03:51.620]  and destroy our children's futures the evidence is overwhelming and out in the open we really
[3:03:52.180 --> 3:03:59.380]  deserve what's happened to us so i asked you now are you going to step up and expose the
[3:03:59.380 --> 3:04:05.700]  new order even more i know i'm pledging to step up and redouble my efforts the front lines the
[3:04:05.700 --> 3:04:08.180]  fight is info wars dot com
[3:04:20.900 --> 3:04:25.620]  live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[3:04:25.620 --> 3:04:31.380]  i used to be such as well there's some great footage up on info wars dot com that i'm not
[3:04:31.380 --> 3:04:34.820]  going to have time to get to here because i want to go to your calls hit some final news
[3:04:34.820 --> 3:04:38.660]  or Gerald salente takes over but i bet it's going to be on the war room today
[3:04:38.660 --> 3:04:45.700]  with Owen shroyer former new york times writer barry weiss confronts brian stelter
[3:04:45.700 --> 3:04:53.860]  over cnn's covet lab leak coverage hunter biden's laptop and more yes you see this is a critical
[3:04:53.860 --> 3:04:57.380]  point we've reached that i talked some about on the saturday emergency broadcast and i talked
[3:04:57.380 --> 3:05:04.580]  some about on the regular sunday show yesterday four to six p.m there comes a time when joe rogan
[3:05:05.940 --> 3:05:10.580]  was a good guy but he couldn't believe it was this evil then he found out he got even more popular
[3:05:10.580 --> 3:05:15.860]  telling the truth and now he's full red pilt now dave chappell's becoming red pilt now tucker
[3:05:15.860 --> 3:05:21.380]  carlson super red pilt and red pilling others he's more black pilt i'm kind of that way too but
[3:05:21.380 --> 3:05:24.980]  but i'm also white pilt at the end of the day we don't know what that means optimistic is a
[3:05:24.980 --> 3:05:29.060]  gob and i'm very black pilt about the current situation but red pilling is the key so people
[3:05:29.060 --> 3:05:37.860]  can see the black pill and the white pill so as it all comes out people now know no one watches
[3:05:37.860 --> 3:05:44.260]  brian stelter but if you go on brian stelter's show and attack him and say he's scum suddenly he
[3:05:44.260 --> 3:05:49.780]  gets 50 million views just like i did when i attacked pierce morgan so so people want the
[3:05:49.780 --> 3:05:55.620]  truth people want truth that they know it's all a fraud so the fouchie came out and said anybody
[3:05:55.620 --> 3:06:02.660]  that questions me is a conspiracy terrorist well that's from 1963 no one believed that kennedy
[3:06:02.660 --> 3:06:08.020]  was killed and by 64 the cia put a memo out he classified in 77 by the church committee
[3:06:08.020 --> 3:06:13.300]  senator church committee and said anybody questioning jfk don't argue the facts don't
[3:06:13.300 --> 3:06:17.860]  get into that just say they're a conspiracy terrorist and so fouchie says people that don't
[3:06:17.860 --> 3:06:23.540]  believe me just don't know the facts i'm a hundred percent right there a hundred percent wrong
[3:06:23.540 --> 3:06:28.980]  and then just 99 percent of the deaths are unvaccinated totally made up never gives a statistic
[3:06:28.980 --> 3:06:37.940]  where it came from it's pure crap but he knows he's talking to an audience that wants to be lied to
[3:06:37.940 --> 3:06:42.020]  which is a very small audience that's why a lot of people even john oliver was out interviewing
[3:06:42.020 --> 3:06:49.460]  people they're like have you ever heard of fouchie know who's he because people don't watch that
[3:06:49.460 --> 3:06:54.020]  lying criminal and the globalists have already figured that out so that's why they launched
[3:06:54.020 --> 3:06:59.860]  the covet hoax try to get us back under their control that's a good video there's so much more
[3:06:59.860 --> 3:07:04.980]  now economists weren't stuck up now inflation could get very very ugly i've been telling you that for

[3:09:37.300 --> 3:09:41.780]  not the overhead and we're not putting a bunch of markup on it but we got to sell a lot of it to
[3:09:41.780 --> 3:09:46.980]  fund our operation so the globalists are working around the clock to try to keep us off air they're
[3:09:46.980 --> 3:09:53.140]  demonizing us they're lying about us but it's okay we're here we're strong and we got a lot of
