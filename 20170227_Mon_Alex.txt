[00:00.000 --> 00:26.680]  Here we are kicking off another week Monday the 27th day of February 2017 I'm your host
[00:26.680 --> 00:31.720]  Alex Jones here teleprompter free coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas broadcasting
[00:31.720 --> 00:38.400]  worldwide you know Starbucks came out a month ago and said they're gonna hire ten thousand
[00:38.400 --> 00:45.640]  refugees and in major consumer indexes they have absolutely plunged their brand has gone
[00:45.640 --> 00:52.520]  into the toilet and isn't that emblematic of how everything the globalists are pushing
[00:52.520 --> 00:59.880]  his tanking with public sentiment in the public mind the public is rejecting them lock stock
[00:59.880 --> 01:08.600]  and barrel meanwhile the enemies of this republic are in high gear trying to kill the Trump
[01:08.600 --> 01:12.640]  recovery that we're only 40 something days into with everything they've got I've got
[01:12.640 --> 01:18.560]  a stack of news where the financial publications are running down this country and running down
[01:18.560 --> 01:24.440]  the UK for trying to pull out of the EU there is an all out financial war going on communist
[01:24.440 --> 01:32.720]  China has weighed in Hollywood of course last night praised Tehran and the moolas praised
[01:32.720 --> 01:38.840]  Hollywood and said how great they were and that they admire the anti-American sentiment
[01:38.840 --> 01:45.280]  when no one in Hollywood who supports the whole anti-family agenda could even live
[01:45.280 --> 01:51.600]  in Iran but they don't care because Iran has some anti-American sentiment mostly young
[01:51.600 --> 01:57.640]  people in major surveys and Iran actually hate the moolas but nevertheless nevertheless
[01:57.640 --> 02:04.400]  the Iranian dictator condemns Donald Trump's Muslim ban in powerful Oscars acceptance
[02:04.400 --> 02:14.360]  speech Iranian director I had a Freudian slip dictator Iranian director Ozgar Har Farhadi
[02:14.360 --> 02:21.360]  condemns Donald Trump's Muslim ban in powerful Oscar acceptance speech funny Iran has a ban
[02:21.360 --> 02:29.640]  on Christians and Jews coming into the country and trying to live there but that's okay because
[02:29.640 --> 02:35.200]  this is all a one sided street we're not banning Muslims we're banning people from seven failed
[02:35.200 --> 02:42.400]  states like Sudan and Somalia and Libya that don't even have working public airports and
[02:42.400 --> 02:47.840]  where women are sold into slavery and their genitals cut off but it doesn't matter because
[02:47.840 --> 02:51.400]  they could bad mouth I mean it would take all day to air all the different so called
[02:51.400 --> 02:56.240]  stars most up in foreigners it seemed up there running down this country and running down
[02:56.240 --> 03:02.800]  President Trump and oh and Jimmy Kimmel saying the world hates America because of Trump no
[03:02.800 --> 03:07.480]  many areas the world hate the United States because the globalists have used us to expand
[03:07.480 --> 03:12.520]  their system while they ran us down now the globalists are fully conquering the US they're
[03:12.520 --> 03:17.480]  using some of the hatred they helped generate as a way to further bring down this country
[03:17.480 --> 03:25.160]  the truth is the world respects Trump from the folks in the UK to France to Russia to
[03:25.160 --> 03:30.080]  Japan to many areas of Africa and Latin America they understand the exploitation America is
[03:30.080 --> 03:36.480]  going under because they've been under it and peoples and nations are all together against
[03:36.480 --> 03:43.760]  the globalist threat we all share that common enemy I was watching Fox News this morning
[03:43.760 --> 03:46.960]  while I was exercising and they were going to Ellis Island talking about all the things
[03:46.960 --> 03:54.920]  you had to do to get through to the United States yeah not have TB not have the plague
[03:54.920 --> 04:01.880]  and not be a burden on the society you couldn't be handicapped because we they didn't have
[04:01.880 --> 04:07.440]  a big social welfare system we couldn't have the world dump people on us or it would make
[04:07.440 --> 04:12.280]  our country go down we brought hard-working peasants out of the country that's who this
[04:12.280 --> 04:20.840]  nation wanted that's what America is based on so they can become wealthy and successful
[04:20.840 --> 04:25.400]  and actually get out of their caste systems that they were in every other country from
[04:25.400 --> 04:33.720]  Japan to Italy but now the great-grandkids of those kids those people that came here
[04:33.720 --> 04:38.040]  are brainwashed running around bitching and complaining you know saying give me free government
[04:38.040 --> 04:42.240]  this give me free government that and open the borders up on and on and on having no
[04:42.240 --> 04:47.880]  connection to reality but living in La La Land speaking of La La Land they announced
[04:47.880 --> 04:54.280]  that La La Land had won and of course it was a really moonlight just showing how they can't
[04:54.280 --> 05:01.200]  get their act together a bunch of dysfunctional scum the United States foreign policy and
[05:01.200 --> 05:05.520]  engagement with Syria has been a disaster and it may start and end with John McCain
[05:05.520 --> 05:09.840]  four years McCain has been a buffer between the Middle East and the United States McCain
[05:09.840 --> 05:14.760]  took a rare trip to Syria in 2013 he met with so-called moderate rebels Obama was bankrolling
[05:14.760 --> 05:18.720]  in army it turned out that these moderate rebels were the ones destabilizing the region
[05:18.720 --> 05:22.760]  and could even be tied to ISIS but of course this would fit the foreign policy of the Obama
[05:22.760 --> 05:27.120]  administration and the Clinton State Department which wanted Bashar Assad removed from power
[05:27.120 --> 05:31.880]  last week McCain took another rare and secret trip to Syria a spokesperson for McCain said
[05:31.880 --> 05:36.680]  he was there to visit with US ground forces to discuss plans to defeat ISIL ISIL not
[05:36.680 --> 05:42.600]  ISIS they were sure to clarify now how coincidental upon McCain's return to the US news stories
[05:42.600 --> 05:46.920]  everywhere are talking about more US ground forces being sent to Syria John McCain is
[05:46.920 --> 05:51.120]  a detriment to our nation the Middle East and peace on this planet he needs to be removed
[05:51.120 --> 05:55.320]  from any unelected duties and it is upon the people in the great state of Arizona to rid
[06:21.120 --> 06:25.400]  of all of those people living in the wilds having to actually build civilization that
[06:25.400 --> 06:30.120]  are our superior ancestors and we need to do everything we can to recapture them everyone
[06:30.120 --> 06:34.360]  knew that you used all the parts of the animal you use the meat for sustenance the fat for
[06:34.360 --> 06:39.920]  cooking but you use the bones for strength from the outside structure full of minerals
[06:39.920 --> 06:44.480]  and key cofactors to the marrow that produces the blood for the body this is the engine
[06:44.480 --> 06:49.360]  of the life essence I'm a long way from the caveman my ancestors were I'm sure as hell
[06:49.360 --> 06:53.560]  trying to get back to that essence that made us what we were and this is a big part of
[06:53.560 --> 06:57.240]  it I know you're going to want to check out caveman ultimate paleo formula for yourself
[06:57.240 --> 07:02.200]  in force life.com today you're investing in your health and supporting the info war when
[07:02.200 --> 07:06.560]  you visit info wars life.com and purchase your supply of survival shield x2 nasa and
[07:06.560 --> 07:11.240]  iodine and all the great products info wars life.com as you know we've talked to pharmacists
[07:11.240 --> 07:17.840]  chemists doctors researchers scientists and the answer is clear iodine is key is paramount
[07:17.840 --> 07:22.280]  and there's still so much new information coming out that we simply can't even keep
[07:22.280 --> 07:28.200]  up with it in our quest for the purest iodine we drill down more than 7000 feet to gather
[07:28.200 --> 07:33.360]  these purple blue crystals to extract the ultra pure iodine on top of that we also screen
[07:33.360 --> 07:38.560]  our iodine for radiation before bottling it is the purest cleanest strongest out there
[07:38.560 --> 07:42.800]  quite frankly I'm flattered that with the launch of survival shield nasa and iodine
[07:42.800 --> 07:47.320]  that major brands and major companies have been knocking down our doors to get our formula
[07:47.320 --> 07:52.000]  and that they have been unable to come up with anything even close to what we have it is
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.520]  exclusive to info wars life.com and the info wars life family of incredible products
[07:58.520 --> 08:18.080]  from the front lines of the information war it's Alex Jones

[08:41.200 --> 08:49.520]  than 225 countries that now hate us and I think that is an amazing thing I'm not the
[08:49.520 --> 08:54.360]  man to unite this country but it can be done we you know if every person watching the show
[08:54.360 --> 08:57.560]  I don't want to get too serious but there are millions and millions of people watching
[08:57.560 --> 09:02.680]  right now and if every one of you took a minute to reach out to one person you disagree with
[09:02.680 --> 09:08.320]  someone you like and have a positive considerate conversation as liberals or conservatives as
[09:08.320 --> 09:14.400]  Americans if we would all do that we can make America great again we really could it starts
[09:14.400 --> 09:15.400]  with us.

[09:30.880 --> 09:35.120]  film and I'm glad homeland security let you in tonight I really am.
[09:35.120 --> 09:40.960]  Meryl Streep has phoned it in for more than 50 films over the course of her lackluster
[09:40.960 --> 09:51.480]  career this is Meryl's 20th Oscar nomination even more made even more amazing considering
[09:51.480 --> 09:56.440]  the fact that she wasn't even in a movie this year we just wrote her name down out of habit
[09:56.440 --> 10:00.680]  Meryl stand up if you would everybody please join me in giving Meryl Streep a totally undeserved
[10:00.680 --> 10:18.880]  round of applause will you the highly overrated Meryl Streep everyone we're gonna have fun

[10:27.240 --> 10:31.760]  is exciting I think it's important that we all know we've all seen it all but it's important
[10:31.760 --> 10:36.600]  that we take a second to appreciate what is happening here we're at the Oscars the Academy
[10:36.600 --> 10:42.080]  Awards you're nominated you've got to come your families are nominated your friends some
[10:42.080 --> 10:46.400]  of you will get to come up here on this stage night and give a speech that the president
[10:46.400 --> 10:52.160]  of the United States will tweet about in in all caps during his 5 a.m. bowel movement
[10:52.160 --> 11:00.040]  tomorrow see it's so easy to reach out and heal we get I want to say maybe this is not
[11:00.040 --> 11:04.560]  a popular thing to say but I want to say thank you to President Trump I mean remember last
[11:04.560 --> 11:13.560]  year when it seemed like the Oscars were racist Lollaland that's what you call progress we
[11:13.560 --> 11:27.840]  lost by the way there's a mistake you guys won best picture there you go they were too
[11:27.840 --> 11:32.600]  busy running around lying about Donald Trump and the nationalist movement that's desperately
[11:32.600 --> 11:38.040]  trying to devolve power from the corrupt Hollywood on the west coast and the corrupt mega banks
[11:38.040 --> 11:43.240]  that have hijacked the country on the east coast they were too busy demonizing a true
[11:43.240 --> 11:50.560]  American champion with incredible charisma and courage to try to restore this republic
[11:50.560 --> 11:57.320]  and be a beacon to other nations to pull out of the corporate global system and all these
[11:57.320 --> 12:02.920]  cowards get up there with their neurotic lifestyles and all their corruption and all their butlers
[12:02.920 --> 12:11.760]  and all their face creams and facelifts and all the rest of it and their train wreck lifestyle
[12:11.760 --> 12:16.320]  and lecture us that we should all bow down to them because Hollywood celebrities know
[12:16.320 --> 12:24.080]  everything and it doesn't mean I don't like a Kurt Russell it doesn't mean I don't like
[12:24.080 --> 12:29.080]  you know some of the great actors out there like Clint Eastwood and they all seem to be
[12:29.080 --> 12:34.080]  patriots don't they you like them in their roles your whole life and then it turns out
[12:34.080 --> 12:44.000]  they're listeners turns out they're dialed into the truth before you were even born
[12:44.000 --> 12:50.440]  but all the rest of them are just the most conceited twisted deceptive hypocritical
[12:50.440 --> 12:59.040]  people on the planet Meryl Streep has famously come out remember but was back in 2003 and
[12:59.040 --> 13:06.720]  lobbied and campaigned for Roman Polanski to have his child rape pedophilia conviction
[13:06.720 --> 13:13.320]  overturned after he grabbed a 13 year old girl this is admitted drugged her and raped
[13:13.320 --> 13:21.000]  her anally and she got up and gave a standing ovation when he was nominated for a film in
[13:21.000 --> 13:30.520]  2003 and helped run the movement promoting the movement that's how elegant she is promoting
[13:30.520 --> 13:39.000]  the move to get him clemency that's disconnected folks and that's who we're talking about here
[13:39.000 --> 13:47.920]  they think you're there like dirt under their shoes it's like Elon Musk and Ray Kurzweil
[13:47.920 --> 13:52.320]  all of them say you will merge with machines or be obsolete you will merge the machines
[13:52.320 --> 13:58.280]  or be stepped on like a bug they believe they know the future they believe they know how
[13:58.280 --> 14:03.120]  we're going to live they believe they have full control over us but the truth is whether
[14:03.120 --> 14:07.640]  it's Hollywood or whether it's Starbucks or whether it's other globalist publications
[14:07.640 --> 14:15.320]  or operations they're all globally not just domestically going into the toilet in fact
[14:15.320 --> 14:19.560]  it's admitted now in the trade publications was the trade publications today variety
[14:19.560 --> 14:24.960]  and others that Hollywood hopes Trump let's China buy them up because they're completely
[14:24.960 --> 14:31.840]  bankrupt it's already over they're bankrupt and even when Matt Damon makes movies for
[14:31.840 --> 14:40.560]  the China market like the Great Wall it loses 80 million dollars JK Rowling has giant palaces
[14:40.560 --> 14:47.840]  all over the world from Tasmania to London but she wants you to take violent military
[14:47.840 --> 14:55.760]  age men Somali and Sudanese refugees in your poor neighborhood but she won't take them
[14:55.760 --> 15:06.720]  in hers again disgusting pig like hypocrites jokes totally anathema I watch large sections
[15:06.720 --> 15:12.080]  of the Oscars this morning and I noticed that they tried to get kids up on the stage and
[15:12.080 --> 15:17.600]  bring you know locals in and try to make it about the viewers because they know their
[15:17.600 --> 15:24.680]  ratings are in the tank they know people are sick of celebrities sick of empty garbage
[15:24.680 --> 15:30.840]  you go out and you do advertising with a celebrity it doesn't sell nowadays it's in the trade
[15:30.840 --> 15:35.440]  publications but we've tested it ourselves you go out and you advertise with a regular
[15:35.440 --> 15:43.000]  real person that's genuine you have incredible success the people are running from the establishment
[15:43.000 --> 15:50.160]  running from liberalism it is the most old hat orthodox oppressive religion in the world
[15:50.160 --> 15:55.360]  it's a religion of being guilty a religion of being obsessed with how you talk and what
[15:55.360 --> 16:01.040]  you do a religion of groveling to a cult that tells you how to live and how to dress and
[16:01.040 --> 16:09.200]  where to go and how to speak no we reject you and Donald Trump knows that how beautiful
[16:09.200 --> 16:15.960]  that he canceled the correspondence dinner oh yes it's canceled it's about the White
[16:15.960 --> 16:21.520]  House it's about the president I love the media keeps acting like oh he's not going
[16:21.520 --> 16:27.720]  will that hurt it it's all about the White House correspondence dinner and turn into
[16:27.720 --> 16:31.400]  this whole thing about the media that's openly calling almost every publication that will
[16:31.400 --> 16:37.040]  be there calls for his death his overthrow calls him a racist lies about him why should
[16:37.040 --> 16:45.200]  he go to an event when he breathes life into it why should he go to a vampire's feast when
[16:45.200 --> 16:55.000]  he's the only red blooded human walking they need him like fish need water like birds need
[16:55.000 --> 17:05.320]  the sky like plants need the sign and like vampires need blood house intelligence committee
[17:05.320 --> 17:08.840]  chairs just come out said no evidence yet of Trump campaign contacts with Russia because
[17:08.840 --> 17:12.840]  there never have been I told you they keep running and if you read the fine print the
[17:12.840 --> 17:17.520]  New York Times they always say no evidence that they actually were doing anything in
[17:17.520 --> 17:22.240]  the campaign just a few people in the campaign talk to Russians that's what you do once they
[17:22.240 --> 17:29.520]  were in the transition that's all coming up but isn't it interesting secret ballots duplicative
[17:29.520 --> 17:35.480]  envelopes armed guards and a star-studded finale so how did the fine-tuned Oscar machine go
[17:35.480 --> 17:42.200]  so wrong well armed guards duplicate ballots everything being checked everything being
[17:42.200 --> 17:46.760]  totally controlled obsessing over a vote that doesn't even matter but you want people to
[17:46.760 --> 17:54.000]  be able to vote with no ID there's a name for hypocrisy in the dictionary and the encyclopedia
[17:54.000 --> 18:06.880]  and it's called Hollywood liberal scum that isn't liberal everything about them's a lie

[20:42.240 --> 20:45.000]  tomorrow night that we're going to be covering live I'm going to be here I'm going to cover
[20:45.000 --> 20:48.640]  it live I'm going to come down here tomorrow night we're going to cover an hour before
[20:48.640 --> 20:54.080]  and we'll cover the speech after leaked audio reveals anti-Trump forces manufacturing hostile
[20:54.080 --> 20:57.480]  town halls yeah the media is telling them go there and do it political fact says Trump
[20:57.480 --> 21:04.520]  is right but proceeds to rate his remarks mostly false.
[21:04.520 --> 21:09.040]  Trump blasted him for peddling fake Russian news narrative that was over the weekend via
[21:09.040 --> 21:13.760]  Twitter now the intelligence committee comes out and says okay he's right there's no evidence
[21:13.760 --> 21:17.360]  we've seen it that's why they wouldn't give it to the house two months ago three months
[21:17.360 --> 21:20.760]  ago when they were first saying this they wouldn't give it to the house because there
[21:20.760 --> 21:25.080]  was no proof I know the people they're blaming they are literally pulling their hair out angry
[21:25.080 --> 21:32.920]  no contact to Russians zero all they've got Flynn talking to the Russian ambassador like
[21:32.920 --> 21:40.120]  he's supposed to do when he's the interim national security advisor already appointed
[21:40.120 --> 21:46.400]  by Trump didn't need to be confirmed by Congress but oh my gosh did you hear the president's
[21:46.400 --> 21:50.320]  national security advisor talk to the Russian ambassador what do you think ambassadors and
[21:50.320 --> 21:56.320]  national security advisors do the president could go meet for a week with Putin in Moscow
[21:56.320 --> 22:01.320]  if he wanted to we elected him he's the president that's what they do can you believe it is
[22:01.320 --> 22:11.920]  talking to the Russians get a Russian agent we've got so much to cover today so much to
[22:11.920 --> 22:20.640]  go over but first off let me bring this out there is a absolute undeclared war but also
[22:20.640 --> 22:26.040]  declared war going on against free speech all over the country and all over the United
[22:26.040 --> 22:31.720]  States but also all over the world there is a massive sustained attack going on and if
[22:31.720 --> 22:36.760]  you're simply aware of it and if you simply speak out against it and take action against
[22:36.760 --> 22:49.160]  it it will fall like a house of rotting cards now that's it if you're not conscious of that
[22:49.160 --> 22:53.480]  and keep yourself in a spectator mode where you're in the fight like you're watching a
[22:53.480 --> 22:57.880]  football game but you're still a spectator and you don't spread the article spread the
[22:57.880 --> 23:03.400]  videos promote the local radio stations if you don't buy products from info wars or other
[23:03.400 --> 23:07.480]  people fight in the new world order if you don't start your own blog or your own YouTube
[23:07.480 --> 23:11.720]  or your own radio show whatever it is if you don't call c-span if you don't take those
[23:11.720 --> 23:16.960]  first steps and I'm not complaining it's going to be hard to win this I'm just simply saying
[23:16.960 --> 23:21.000]  it's a choice and it's up to you you've already done amazing things and the activists out
[23:21.000 --> 23:25.120]  there have done the work of hundreds of people many of them individually or thousands of
[23:25.120 --> 23:30.400]  people but we need all of you to keep your mind in the fight your eye on the prize and
[23:30.400 --> 23:35.440]  have that eye of the tiger and never give up never give in never back down because just
[23:35.440 --> 23:41.360]  because we got trump in means the war as myself and Michael Savage and others said has just
[23:41.360 --> 23:48.440]  begun the fight has only just started and they say that themselves they are coming for us
[23:48.440 --> 23:51.960]  the globalists are spending more money than ever they're getting nastier than ever they
[23:51.960 --> 23:57.480]  are doing unbelievable things and we have to absolutely boycott everything they do just
[23:57.480 --> 24:01.440]  like trumps not going to the correspondence dinner it's all about him why should he just
[24:01.440 --> 24:05.800]  like he said oh we're going to have some press briefings where you don't always get in we're
[24:05.800 --> 24:12.240]  going to make room for other media sometimes exactly what I said have it be random or sometimes
[24:12.240 --> 24:18.320]  these groups get in sometimes those groups get in so we had congressman you know Joe
[24:18.320 --> 24:22.720]  Wilson come out and say you lie that's exactly what trumps doing from the main stage when
[24:22.720 --> 24:31.880]  they lie he says you lie last week he said a lot of mainstream media puts out fake news
[24:31.880 --> 24:36.520]  and fake news is the enemy of the American people they said he said the news is the enemy
[24:36.520 --> 24:42.120]  like he's a dictator and he came out he said no I said fake news see how they deceive see
[24:42.120 --> 24:48.880]  how they lie but the point is you always want to bully pulpit we finally have one in Donald
[24:48.880 --> 24:55.080]  J. Trump you always wanted to take action against the globalist we have it but you and I and
[24:55.080 --> 25:00.720]  all of us have to get even more involved and more active in this animating contest it's

[29:59.840 --> 30:03.760]  the united states foreign policy and engagement with syria has been a disaster and it may
[30:03.760 --> 30:08.160]  start and end with john mccain four years mccain has been a buffer between the middle
[30:08.160 --> 30:13.040]  east and the united states mccain took a rare trip to syria in 2013 he met with so called
[30:13.040 --> 30:17.040]  moderate rebels obama was bankrolling an army it turned out that these moderate rebels were
[30:17.040 --> 30:21.200]  the ones destabilizing the region and could even be tied to isis but of course this would
[30:21.200 --> 30:25.360]  fit the foreign policy of the obama administration and the clinton state department which wanted
[30:25.360 --> 30:30.400]  bachar Assad removed from power last week mccain took another rare and secret trip to syria
[30:30.400 --> 30:34.600]  a spokesperson for mccain said he was there to visit with us ground forces to discuss
[30:34.600 --> 30:40.360]  plans to defeat isle isle not isis they were sure to clarify now how coincidental upon
[30:40.360 --> 30:44.840]  mccain's return to the u.s. news stories everywhere are talking about more u.s. ground
[30:44.840 --> 30:48.920]  forces being sent to syria john mccain is a detriment to our nation the middle east

[35:58.760 --> 36:03.120]  all come out against Trump mainstream media has promoted it they say do witchcraft against
[36:03.120 --> 36:07.600]  him call for his death that's been promoted major newspapers that shows you who these
[36:07.600 --> 36:14.160]  people really are I told you you scratch an atheist you get a Satanist and I do not mean
[36:14.160 --> 36:19.960]  your average run-of-the-mill atheist on the ground I totally get atheists that have seen

[36:23.600 --> 36:28.600]  to do with that you know religious turned into a cult of control I'm not talking about
[36:28.600 --> 36:34.320]  state-run religion I'm talking about the spiritual realm the dimensions mathematics have proven
[36:34.320 --> 36:39.640]  it all these different top mathematicians end up becoming religious or spiritual I should
[36:39.640 --> 36:45.160]  say because there's something else going on we're on a planet in deep space folks and
[36:45.160 --> 36:51.480]  if you get into history and you get into what the top people are into they're into the occult
[36:51.480 --> 36:55.560]  and there is a light side there's a dark side to this and you're at your great peril if
[36:55.560 --> 37:06.840]  you ignore it it's a fact now I've got so much to get to here one story is up on info wars
[37:06.840 --> 37:10.640]  dot com and just went up as I said it did the other big one is going up it's gonna be red
[37:10.640 --> 37:17.200]  linked very very soon dealing with the fact that Obama rated Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae
[37:17.200 --> 37:23.600]  the big government back loan system to fund Obamacare that is absolutely illegal completely
[37:23.600 --> 37:27.920]  out of control and there's an image I want to put up on screen for TV viewers it's up
[37:27.920 --> 37:38.080]  on info wars dot com as today's editorial cartoon and it says it all it's a doctor looking
[37:38.080 --> 37:45.040]  at an x-ray in a medical office and Uncle Sam is sitting on the table on the exam table
[37:45.040 --> 37:50.400]  with a giant octopus called Obamacare as a face sucker wrapped around him suffocating
[37:50.400 --> 37:57.640]  him with one tentacle around the GOP actually it should be that the giant thing on the face
[37:57.640 --> 38:03.760]  of Uncle Sam is the GOP and Democratic Party that are the octopus who created Obamacare
[38:03.760 --> 38:07.080]  is a giant ripoff for insurance companies and big banks to double and triple prices
[38:07.080 --> 38:12.640]  and make you buy their product and and the octopus should be saying to Trump who's trying
[38:12.640 --> 38:16.720]  to pull it off of Uncle Sam the American people that know you're never gonna stop me this
[38:16.720 --> 38:22.560]  is my dinner I own this country I own their souls get out of my way but still removing
[38:22.560 --> 38:27.960]  it may take a little longer than we thought yeah because they're saying everyone must
[38:27.960 --> 38:31.840]  be covered people are always covered under charity care and churches and local systems
[38:31.840 --> 38:37.560]  why do you think almost all major hospitals are owned by big churches by the Seventh
[38:37.560 --> 38:40.600]  Day Adventist by the Catholics and others because they're supposed to give out most
[38:40.600 --> 38:46.080]  health care for free and doctors are supposed to give out 30% when my dad went to medical
[38:46.080 --> 38:53.280]  school 30% of it was supposed to be free people say oh Ron Paul so great he used to work two
[38:53.280 --> 39:04.360]  days a week at a charity hospital for $2 a night to pay for his gas in his food $2 a
[39:04.360 --> 39:09.280]  night delivering up to three babies a night while Ron Paul was such a saint and you know
[39:09.280 --> 39:13.400]  what he was one of the last type of daughters that still did that but he only got out of
[39:13.400 --> 39:21.400]  being a doctor 20 years ago 23 years ago Ron Paul knew you went to charity hospitals and
[39:21.400 --> 39:30.400]  you did stuff for free but see charity hospitals aren't charity hospitals they're big old giant
[39:30.400 --> 39:35.680]  corrupt institutions on average now but see I'm cursed with having medical people in my
[39:35.680 --> 39:41.800]  family who also were in major medical management in some cases of hundreds of facilities hundreds
[39:41.800 --> 39:47.480]  when my dad retired three years ago he was managing over a hundred facilities my dad
[39:47.480 --> 39:53.080]  gets called in to you'll testify in the legislature on laws you name it terms he developed are
[39:53.080 --> 39:59.120]  actually used in Texas law now and I'm not bragging I'm just explaining I know what
[39:59.120 --> 40:08.160]  I'm talking about when I tell you Obama cares a giant screw job but that's okay MSNBC just
[40:08.160 --> 40:13.000]  said it's free and Alex Jones is deeply racist and that's why folks don't like it is the article
[40:13.000 --> 40:17.600]  up on info wars.com yet I know it's supposed to be ready a while ago let's hit refresh

[40:49.960 --> 40:54.120]  own your family but the beautiful thing is whether it's Jimmy Kimmel or any of these
[40:54.120 --> 40:59.880]  people their ratings are down most people don't like them almost everyone is sick of them
[40:59.880 --> 41:03.360]  there are comics that are 14 years old again on YouTube that have more views every day
[41:03.360 --> 41:08.120]  than Jimmy Kimmel and all these other people combined have they're a joke and no amount
[41:08.120 --> 41:13.120]  of internet censorship no amount of tyranny will ever put you back in control of the American
[41:13.120 --> 41:20.640]  people again you know I notice you mainly watches Jimmy Kimmel and Colbert and its old people
[41:20.640 --> 41:26.600]  and nothing against old people but it's old people that think it's hip and cool that's
[41:26.600 --> 41:31.100]  all you've got that's all Fox News has got it's all any of you have no one under the
[41:31.100 --> 41:36.320]  age of 45 that I know believes anything that comes out of your mouth unless they're adult
[41:36.320 --> 41:43.960]  social justice warriors that have been brainwashed by the educational system and have giant stinking
[41:43.960 --> 41:51.320]  chips on their shoulders that's it that's the only people that's all so just realize
[41:51.320 --> 41:55.840]  they're always someone how they're cool and everybody else is dumb but them it's because
[41:55.840 --> 42:01.080]  the globalist and their minions are so uncool and so establishment and then all they've
[42:01.080 --> 42:06.320]  got is the very dumbest constituents unless they're constituents because they're part
[42:06.320 --> 42:11.080]  of the gravy train feeding on the dumb mass of people and they want to grow a bigger mass
[42:11.080 --> 42:15.560]  of dumb people that they siphon off of that they use as a political weapon against the
[42:15.560 --> 42:20.200]  dwindling middle class and these parasites just like all the failed wannabes that went
[42:20.200 --> 42:24.560]  to California to make it big California is now imploding so all those failures are now
[42:24.560 --> 42:33.880]  running to Toronto and running to Austin Texas and ruining everything there like locusts
[42:33.880 --> 42:39.880]  flying into a field and stripping everything off the plants in minutes they are the plague
[42:39.880 --> 42:45.560]  and they come to dominate they come to control they come to bully they're a bunch of gangsters
[42:45.560 --> 42:51.920]  what they are is wimp gangs guilt gangs that are there to guilt you into submission and
[42:51.920 --> 43:02.040]  worshiping them so let's go to this report by john bound here it is anti-trump celebrities
[43:02.040 --> 43:09.160]  joined forces at the united voices rally staged by hollywood's united talent agency in lieu
[43:09.160 --> 43:39.120]  of its usual pre oscar party while other celebrities resorted to calling on the demon
[43:39.120 --> 43:44.560]  that run their lives to alter america's destiny which is across the country we're gathering
[43:44.560 --> 44:00.640]  at the stroke of midnight to put a hex on president trumps you see this the 2017 oscars
[44:00.640 --> 44:06.880]  were of course an opportunity for all of hollywood to bash their commander in chief but I want
[44:06.880 --> 44:10.880]  to say thank you to president trump I mean remember last year when it seemed like the
[44:10.880 --> 44:17.200]  oscars were racist everybody please join me in giving me a totally undeserved round
[44:17.200 --> 44:30.320]  of applause according to these globalist pawns the silent majority of americans who voted
[44:30.320 --> 44:35.480]  donald trump into the executive office are wrong while an industry that can't get enough
[44:35.480 --> 44:41.260]  of its own celebrity assumes like congress and the mainstream media that americans are
[44:41.260 --> 44:46.960]  foolish enough to support their limousine leftist opinions all this from a tiny city
[44:46.960 --> 44:53.760]  in liberal hell california that is fast becoming an outpost for chinese propaganda jamie white
[44:53.760 --> 45:00.400]  writes hollywood is set to begin work on little america a dystopian adventure movies set in
[45:00.400 --> 45:06.680]  a future where a trump like us president has bankrupted america and china has called in
[45:06.680 --> 45:12.800]  its debts china views film as a component of social control states a report from the
[45:12.800 --> 45:19.080]  us china economic and security review commission noting that when it comes to chinese policies
[45:19.080 --> 45:25.680]  for regulating movies these chinese communist party concerns are positioned above all other
[45:25.680 --> 45:30.520]  interests the country is divided right now i've been getting a lot of advice people have
[45:30.520 --> 45:33.280]  been telling me it's time to bring everyone together you need to say something to unite
[45:33.280 --> 45:39.800]  us and let's just get somebody straight off the top i'm not i can't do that that's not
[45:39.800 --> 45:50.640]  there's only one brave heart in this room and he's not going to unite us either okay
[45:50.640 --> 45:56.760]  no you look great i think the scientology is working i really do hollywood is slitting
[45:56.760 --> 46:01.880]  its own throat assuming by the authority of its own arrogance that americans actually
[46:01.880 --> 46:07.440]  care what it thinks you're not god there are 14 year old youtubers that have more viewers
[46:07.440 --> 46:14.440]  every day than all of cnn combined we certainly have more viewers and listeners here every
[46:14.440 --> 46:22.040]  week on average and cnn does they are a complete hoax and so trump says you want to have cnn
[46:22.040 --> 46:26.440]  you want to have the washington post newsweek time magazine all calling for civil insurrection
[46:26.440 --> 46:32.080]  overthrow murder of the president you want to boycott and financially block anybody on
[46:32.080 --> 46:36.680]  youtube or google or facebook trying to promote the president's ideas and bringing our jobs
[46:36.680 --> 46:43.600]  back well the president's going to start blocking you bullies we're only calling for his death
[46:43.600 --> 46:48.840]  we're only calling him a nazi we're only lying about him when he says fake news is the enemy
[46:48.840 --> 46:53.160]  of the american people they come out and say that you're here president trump says all
[46:53.160 --> 46:58.400]  media and questioning him as the enemy that's how a dictator talks trump gives a speech and
[46:58.400 --> 47:03.160]  goes i didn't do that i said fake news is the enemy and that's my free speech you're
[47:03.160 --> 47:09.040]  calling for me to be killed the real celebrities are the inventors of this republic the founding
[47:09.040 --> 47:16.520]  fathers of the united states of america john bound for info wars dot com all right we're
[47:16.520 --> 47:21.040]  going to tweak this out at real alex jones during the next break needs to be spread
[47:21.040 --> 47:25.200]  far and wide you want to get rid of obama care you got to keep the heat on it because
[47:25.200 --> 47:31.920]  the media and the republican party on fox news are already involved in frontal assaults
[47:31.920 --> 47:36.880]  via the democrats but backhanded assaults via the republicans saying oh what's trump going
[47:36.880 --> 47:41.160]  to do if we don't have obama care it'll really hurt people there's some good parts of it
[47:41.160 --> 47:46.720]  oh look he's not getting rid of it right away as he goes full steam ahead trying to repeal
[47:46.720 --> 47:51.760]  it and he's already delivered on more good things than ronald reagan did in eight years
[47:51.760 --> 47:57.680]  in 40 something days it's unbelievable if you think about everything's done and again
[47:57.680 --> 48:01.560]  they're trying to stall the trump recovery they're trying to create a global recession
[48:01.560 --> 48:07.400]  they're trying to create a retail crisis they're trying to stall small businesses right now
[48:07.400 --> 48:11.320]  and trump is desperately trying to get the federal reserve and removing the federal
[48:11.320 --> 48:17.360]  reserve folks but this week and putting in his own people to get loans to small businesses
[48:17.360 --> 48:21.680]  as fast as he can so if he's unable to do this as ron paul said on the air here a month
[48:21.680 --> 48:27.720]  ago it was too little too late even though he said quote trumps doing a great job cutting
[48:27.720 --> 48:31.540]  regulations and trying to cut taxes and everything else he's announced but i think it's too little
[48:31.540 --> 48:38.040]  too late so remember that everybody that hates trump just keep working against him as hard
[48:38.040 --> 48:42.240]  as you can the hollywood elitist when you're homeless aren't going to bring into their
[48:42.240 --> 48:49.560]  homes now here's the big exclusive upon info wars dot com obama illegally robbed fanny

[49:07.040 --> 49:14.200]  final nail in the coffin for the affordable care act commonly known as obozo ripoff care
[49:14.200 --> 49:20.760]  or mega bank care mega bank looting care federal court litigation provides evidence
[49:20.760 --> 49:24.480]  that obama administration legally diverted taxpayer funds that had not been appropriated
[49:24.480 --> 49:28.680]  by congress in an unconstitutional scheme to keep obama care from imploding you got
[49:28.680 --> 49:33.960]  to give those foreign banks to put you in office all that money in 2016 a u.s. district
[49:33.960 --> 49:38.680]  judge caught the obama administration health and human services department acting unconstitutionally
[49:38.680 --> 49:43.280]  and therefore put an end to the illegal diversion of taxpayer funds but the obamas didn't stop
[49:43.280 --> 49:50.040]  there this is exclusive folks this was pointed out to us by the white house this came from
[49:50.040 --> 49:55.800]  the white house well the mainstream level fit with that the obama administration instead

[55:59.760 --> 56:05.360]  for housing loans in the 90s that created a bubble then when it imploded they made it
[56:05.360 --> 56:10.520]  way hard for smaller brokerage firms and other groups to actually you know go out and and
[56:10.520 --> 56:15.360]  do the deals for houses they created all these new fees and fines and frank dot that made
[56:15.360 --> 56:22.720]  it so they could then behind the scenes loot the hell out of the money upwards of 10 percent

[1:01:12.600 --> 1:01:17.480]  to see the trump agenda it's very simple it was all in the speeches he went around to
[1:01:17.480 --> 1:01:21.480]  these rallies but those speeches had tremendous amount of content in them right i happen to
[1:01:21.480 --> 1:01:25.480]  believe and i think many others do he's probably the greatest public speaker in those large
[1:01:25.480 --> 1:01:30.760]  arenas since william jennings bryan this was galvanized remember we didn't have any money
[1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:33.880]  hillary clinton these guys had over two billion dollars we had a couple of hundred million
[1:01:33.880 --> 1:01:39.440]  dollars it was those rallies and those speeches all he's doing right now is he's laid out
[1:01:39.440 --> 1:01:44.600]  an agenda with those speeches with the promises he made and our job every day is just to execute
[1:01:44.600 --> 1:01:50.360]  on that is to simply get a path to how those get executed we got to mobilize we got to
[1:01:50.360 --> 1:01:56.280]  march forward as if it's the most important time in the history of our movement because
[1:01:56.280 --> 1:02:05.200]  it is men and women of this moment there is no time like the present so make your voices
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:11.160]  heard in town halls with your family and your friends on the internet and social media and

[1:03:03.560 --> 1:03:08.600]  their own agenda they have a professional obligation as members of the press to report
[1:03:08.600 --> 1:03:17.920]  honestly but as you saw throughout the entire campaign and even now the fake news doesn't
[1:03:17.920 --> 1:03:24.280]  tell the truth and our victory was a win for everyone who believes it's time to stand up

[1:05:09.560 --> 1:05:13.440]  be shadowed by the democrat trolls who are planning on bringing guests such as muslim
[1:05:13.440 --> 1:05:18.200]  americans and dreamers in a sad attempt to tug at the heartstrings of america's electorate
[1:05:18.200 --> 1:05:22.760]  and in an attempt to cast trump as the bad guy so instead of concern for their constituents
[1:05:22.760 --> 1:05:26.640]  in the states and counties that they represent their outcasting nets in a search effort to
[1:05:26.640 --> 1:05:31.200]  find political pawns they can use against trump in the psychological battle of optics
[1:05:31.200 --> 1:05:36.440]  this is also an opportunity for trump to again sound the sirens of nationalism against globalism

[1:09:11.240 --> 1:09:39.760]  Trump to bring him down very exciting time to be alive to say the least
[1:09:39.760 --> 1:09:46.920]  you see the establishment completely coming after Trump because he's for real the book
[1:09:46.920 --> 1:09:51.240]  how Trump won by Joel V. Pollock thank you so much for joining us where do you want to
[1:09:51.240 --> 1:09:57.600]  start my friend well it's good to be with you wow tell us about you why you wrote the
[1:09:57.600 --> 1:10:03.280]  book what's in the book and you know currently where you see the presidency going well let
[1:10:03.280 --> 1:10:07.840]  me let you and your viewers in on a little secret I wrote the book because I expected
[1:10:07.840 --> 1:10:13.360]  him to lose I thought Trump would win the nomination but like many others in the media
[1:10:13.360 --> 1:10:17.480]  including in the conservative media I didn't think he was going to win the election and
[1:10:17.480 --> 1:10:21.920]  one of the things that bothered me most was that after the election there was going to
[1:10:21.920 --> 1:10:27.040]  be this civil war among conservatives and in the Republican Party and that this was
[1:10:27.040 --> 1:10:32.760]  going to damage the effect to move forward with defending the Constitution holding government
[1:10:32.760 --> 1:10:37.720]  accountable and so forth so I was trying to make head or tail of this election and tell
[1:10:37.720 --> 1:10:43.400]  the story of how this election came about in the crazy way that it did and to try to
[1:10:43.400 --> 1:10:47.360]  unify all these different strands together and maybe come up with some basis through
[1:10:47.360 --> 1:10:51.680]  which the future opposition which I assumed would be Republicans could come together
[1:10:51.680 --> 1:10:54.960]  rather than tearing each other apart sure you know what's funny and that's why I wanted
[1:10:54.960 --> 1:10:58.680]  to interview you because I knew that I heard the other folks at right bar that that's where
[1:10:58.680 --> 1:11:05.400]  your book was going I told folks Trump's gonna win according to internal polls and we know
[1:11:05.400 --> 1:11:09.400]  that they're skewing these other CNN polls and others but when he wins it'll just be
[1:11:09.400 --> 1:11:14.360]  a battle we won because the bureaucracy the Republican establishment the Democrats the
[1:11:14.360 --> 1:11:19.160]  globalist all the foreign money is going to pile in against him so the fights just beginning
[1:11:19.160 --> 1:11:24.160]  Trump getting in was just a beachhead and so your book is perfect now to talk about
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:29.160]  the battle still going on in the Republican Party and how we've got to basically have
[1:11:29.160 --> 1:11:35.280]  a Trump victory throughout that system first to be able to get this agenda through right
[1:11:35.280 --> 1:11:39.840]  well my co-author Larry Schweikart he was convinced Trump would win from the beginning
[1:11:39.840 --> 1:11:44.160]  and so you talk about those internal polls he was one of the people feeding some of those
[1:11:44.160 --> 1:11:48.560]  polls he had a group of volunteer pollsters that he pulled together they call themselves
[1:11:48.560 --> 1:11:52.680]  the renegade deplorables and they were feeding information to the Trump campaign that the
[1:11:52.680 --> 1:11:57.280]  professional pollsters didn't have so as you read the book you find out a lot of interesting
[1:11:57.280 --> 1:12:02.760]  facts about how Larry knew that this election was going to go the way it did but I was on
[1:12:02.760 --> 1:12:08.320]  the outside covering the campaign with an outsider's view I was at the traveling press
[1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:12.880]  corps looking at it although I was the only conservative member of that press corps the
[1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:17.240]  only person from a conservative publication I still was traveling with them seeing what
[1:12:17.240 --> 1:12:21.840]  they saw and so I came to it with some degree of skepticism about whether or not he could
[1:12:21.840 --> 1:12:26.240]  actually win but then as you read the book you see how I got more and more clues from
[1:12:26.240 --> 1:12:30.480]  the people in the audience is that these rallies from talking to the voters themselves about
[1:12:30.480 --> 1:12:34.560]  why they were convinced he was going to win here we knew that there was a phantom group
[1:12:34.560 --> 1:12:38.520]  out there who was intimidated to say they supported Trump that's what I saw on the streets
[1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:43.640]  of Texas but also California you name it when I traveled but also we saw if you have access
[1:12:43.640 --> 1:12:50.480]  to Bloomberg data which is huge or Thompson Reuters or the Google bots and other systems
[1:12:50.480 --> 1:12:54.720]  that's why the media was so panic saying Trump can't win he's a loser he's an idiot was because
[1:12:54.720 --> 1:12:59.760]  they knew internally as well that he was really 5 10 15 points depending on the poll ahead
[1:12:59.760 --> 1:13:05.080]  when he came out of the RNC in Cleveland in July he was 15 points ahead in real polls the
[1:13:05.080 --> 1:13:10.120]  big story is is Republican and Democratic pollsters were all against Trump they wouldn't do an
[1:13:10.120 --> 1:13:14.000]  honest poll and that came out in the WikiLeaks as well that they were quote over sampling
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:18.840]  Democrats not just seven points like they claim demographic show but 15 20 points hell
[1:13:18.840 --> 1:13:25.800]  they had CNN phone polls that had her winning by 76% my friend they still got polls out
[1:13:25.800 --> 1:13:30.800]  so we hear he's at 55 and Gallup only 10 points up from the election and they say that's
[1:13:30.800 --> 1:13:36.880]  good news from my research it's way way above that and that's why they're so panicked right
[1:13:36.880 --> 1:13:41.880]  well one of the other interesting thing was that the media made it so negative to be a
[1:13:41.880 --> 1:13:45.880]  Trump supporter that people wouldn't admit to pollsters that they were voting for Trump
[1:13:45.880 --> 1:13:50.040]  and there was one poll that asked people an additional question not just who you voting
[1:13:50.040 --> 1:13:54.840]  for but who your neighbors voting for and that gave people cover to say oh my neighbors
[1:13:54.840 --> 1:13:59.080]  are voting for Trump so they could express their own preference for Trump without admitting
[1:13:59.080 --> 1:14:04.640]  it themselves and those polls were more accurate because that was a more safe way for these
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:07.560]  people to express their preference and that's why your book so important that's why we're
[1:14:07.560 --> 1:14:11.600]  selling it we saw Roger Stone's excellent book the making the president real inside
[1:14:11.600 --> 1:14:16.760]  view on the guerrilla wars on the ground for this populist victory but yours gets into
[1:14:16.760 --> 1:14:21.320]  covering in the campaign but also the inside strategist and other groups out there looking
[1:14:21.320 --> 1:14:24.880]  at real polls again when you're doing a poll we're not like Democrats that would run out
[1:14:24.880 --> 1:14:29.360]  and do a fake poll to say Hillary was 30 40 points ahead we were wanting to know and the
[1:14:29.360 --> 1:14:34.200]  groups I was talking to where Trump really was and so that's why I kept hammering and
[1:14:34.200 --> 1:14:39.040]  the media made fun of this in thousands of publications Jones is crazy he says Trump
[1:14:39.040 --> 1:14:44.520]  has internal polls Conway's crazy but it's the truth and the truth is from our research
[1:14:44.520 --> 1:14:48.880]  Hillary stole five states Hillary tried to steal another six that were breaking into
[1:14:48.880 --> 1:14:52.560]  the computers and that's why she was so pissed that's why they had the news week printed
[1:14:52.560 --> 1:14:55.480]  that she was Madam President it's why they had the book printed where Hillary was going
[1:14:55.480 --> 1:15:00.000]  to lead the book and her daughter the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation worldwide it's
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:04.120]  why they had the TV shows were the Madam Presidents in charge and there's a right wing
[1:15:04.120 --> 1:15:09.640]  rebellion against her that has to be arrested they were all scripted all programmed already
[1:15:09.640 --> 1:15:14.520]  for this and it blew up in their face well you know one of the most interesting polling
[1:15:14.520 --> 1:15:19.040]  failures wasn't even in the general election it was in the primary in Michigan where Hillary
[1:15:19.040 --> 1:15:24.960]  was up 30% over Bernie Sanders in the primary and then on election day he came back and
[1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:29.360]  beat her I mean that's an amazing it was one of the biggest upsets in the history of polling
[1:15:29.360 --> 1:15:32.960]  but you see they weren't finding the voters that wanted to come out and vote against Hillary
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:38.400]  they had old pools where they knew they'd get what they wanted right and Trump I think
[1:15:38.400 --> 1:15:42.600]  accessed a lot of those voters you know Bernie Sanders voters people who cared about the
[1:15:42.600 --> 1:15:47.360]  issues Trump was talking about trade and immigration and so forth but didn't want to be known as
[1:15:47.360 --> 1:15:51.440]  Republicans or Trump voters necessarily I think one of the reasons the exit polls on
[1:15:51.440 --> 1:15:56.440]  election day were so wrong is that a lot of those Bernie Sanders voters walked out of
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:15:59.640]  the polling places didn't want to talk to anybody they didn't want to talk to the pollsters
[1:15:59.640 --> 1:16:04.400]  it was their vote their private affair they didn't want to tell anybody about it and you
[1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:08.240]  know Frank Luntz on the day of the election tweeted out based on the election polls Hillary
[1:16:08.240 --> 1:16:11.440]  Clinton is going to be the next president of the United States and then after it turned
[1:16:11.440 --> 1:16:15.320]  out of course quite the opposite he said this is the biggest disaster in the history of exit
[1:16:15.320 --> 1:16:18.840]  polling but there were a lot of people who just did not want to share their preferences
[1:16:18.840 --> 1:16:23.160]  with professional pollsters absolutely well look at Hollywood the Oscars ratings are
[1:16:23.160 --> 1:16:28.280]  way down they couldn't even get who best pitcher was right they spent most of the show bashing
[1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:32.840]  Trump saying about talking about how he goes to the bathroom at 5 a.m. and you know how
[1:16:32.840 --> 1:16:40.840]  he's a racist you could not be more out of touch than the professional pollsters msm Hollywood
[1:16:40.840 --> 1:16:46.920]  this whole group of mummies who just aren't connected to reality now they're kind of freaking
[1:16:46.920 --> 1:16:52.960]  out going into panic mode where do you see all this going well it's very interesting
[1:16:52.960 --> 1:16:57.640]  because there's a lot of panic right now in the media for two reasons one they tried to
[1:16:57.640 --> 1:17:03.720]  stop Trump from winning and they couldn't do it so he undermined their power and the
[1:17:03.720 --> 1:17:08.320]  other thing is they're trying to get the American people to turn against him but Trump's voters
[1:17:08.320 --> 1:17:14.240]  aren't leaving him behind because he's doing so far most of what he promised to do so he's
[1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:19.200]  undermining the media's credibility and he's still going all the way when they block him
[1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:23.680]  yeah the media acts like he went back on a promise when he just keeps fighting that's
[1:17:23.680 --> 1:17:29.600]  right and he's laying out an agenda in addition to taking these executive actions and executive
[1:17:29.600 --> 1:17:35.400]  orders but he's laying out an agenda to achieve what he told people he would achieve now obviously
[1:17:35.400 --> 1:17:39.600]  he promised some very big things some of which are going to be very hard to deliver but as
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:43.200]  long as he doesn't turn his back on his own voters and I don't think his own voters feel
[1:17:43.200 --> 1:17:47.400]  that he has he's going to remain in that strong position and the media really should know
[1:17:47.400 --> 1:17:51.800]  that this works because basically that's what Obama did I mean Obama kept his coalition
[1:17:51.800 --> 1:17:55.200]  together so that even when he was letting down the rest of the country even when the
[1:17:55.200 --> 1:17:59.320]  independence deserted him the Obama voters were still in his camp and that's how he came
[1:17:59.320 --> 1:18:03.360]  back in one in 2012 so we've been in this movie before but the media thinks it only
[1:18:03.360 --> 1:18:09.120]  goes one way that's right and Obama of course is keeping his coalition he's moved in close
[1:18:09.120 --> 1:18:13.560]  to the White House in a bunker he's saying he's going to help foment with Soros this
[1:18:13.560 --> 1:18:18.440]  whole downfall of Trump that only makes it more clear to everybody who's a populist of
[1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:22.600]  every race color and creed that Trump's the real deal in fact for me because I'm somebody
[1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:27.240]  that's a big skeptic big anti-establishment but I study what Trump actually does the
[1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:34.600]  research the on targetness it's almost unbelievable how good he is from my populist hardcore libertarian
[1:18:34.600 --> 1:18:39.040]  perspective I mean he's just so good it's it's it's unbelievable he really approaches
[1:18:39.040 --> 1:18:43.920]  things from what's right what's just what's common sense I mean I'm sorry I have to fawn
[1:18:43.920 --> 1:18:48.400]  after Trump well here's the other thing about it you know he brings his skills as it
[1:18:48.400 --> 1:18:52.520]  is a businessman to the Oval Office but when people talk about that they tend to focus
[1:18:52.520 --> 1:18:56.760]  on the management skills that you bring from the business world the other thing he brings
[1:18:56.760 --> 1:19:01.640]  is a feeling for the consumer and politicians don't have a sense for the consumer they never
[1:19:01.640 --> 1:19:07.240]  offer us what we want if you're in business as a salesman or as a service person then
[1:19:07.240 --> 1:19:11.240]  you better be dialed into what people are saying you're done exactly Pelosi's up there
[1:19:11.240 --> 1:19:15.800]  saying she has anything wrong and thinks Bush is still in office and you know Waters thinks
[1:19:15.800 --> 1:19:19.960]  that the Russians have invaded Korea now you talk about disconnected in La La Land
[1:19:19.960 --> 1:19:25.240]  right so he had a feeling for the consumer and he knew better what was going on in the
[1:19:25.240 --> 1:19:30.000]  minds and hearts of the people in that audience than the professionals did and the consultants
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:33.400]  did all right well let's talk about where it's going we have the author Joel B. Pollack

[1:24:11.480 --> 1:24:17.800]  revolution we saw the book at m4store.com and here's the bottom line you may already know about all
[1:24:17.800 --> 1:24:23.320]  this stuff most people don't and if you can even get a so-called liberal to read something like
[1:24:23.320 --> 1:24:27.800]  this and to see the manipulations the deception all the things that were in wiki leaks they
[1:24:27.800 --> 1:24:31.240]  can really wake up to how they're being conned there's a lot of liberals actually believe
[1:24:31.240 --> 1:24:38.840]  trump is this evil horrible racist who's out to get them and once they buy into that mindset
[1:24:39.880 --> 1:24:43.960]  it's hard to get them out of it now coming up the next segment for the next hour and a half
[1:24:43.960 --> 1:24:49.480]  i'm going to take your phone calls cover clips cover what happened at the oscars and more so i'll

[1:25:02.280 --> 1:25:06.680]  the book i've only read part of it i look forward to reading the whole thing but i'd gotten the inside
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:10.600]  scoop of what it was on i was actually aware of some of the things in it that i'd kept close to the
[1:25:10.600 --> 1:25:16.520]  vest so i'm glad we can talk about some of the things that are now in the book but again congratulations
[1:25:16.520 --> 1:25:20.040]  just don't ask five minutes so what do you want to talk about instead of me asking questions
[1:25:21.720 --> 1:25:26.120]  well let's talk about as you said the road ahead from here and and where trump's going to go you
[1:25:26.120 --> 1:25:31.720]  know this week he's got his first address to a joint session of congress not technically a state of
[1:25:31.720 --> 1:25:37.880]  the union address but pretty close to it and i think that the democrats are busy trying to figure
[1:25:37.880 --> 1:25:44.200]  out how to troll this address they were inviting all kinds of people yesterday we saw they're inviting
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:49.640]  illegal aliens to the address to sit there in the gallery and they don't really know what to do i mean
[1:25:49.640 --> 1:25:53.640]  one of the more interesting things that he did during this election was he didn't just go for
[1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:58.760]  the swing voters he reached right into the heart of the democratic coalition and got those democratic
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:05.160]  base voters to join his side and the democrats are in a flat out panic about it so we know more
[1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:09.320]  or less what trump's going to say in congress because he's been saying it all along he we know
[1:26:09.320 --> 1:26:12.920]  what his agenda is he's pretty transparent about it but the really interesting thing is to see how
[1:26:12.920 --> 1:26:17.480]  the opposition reacts and what kind of resistance as they call it they're going to be putting up
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:22.920]  and i love how the whole establishment the republican leadership they're all against him
[1:26:22.920 --> 1:26:28.600]  but then the democrats now call themselves the resistance because myself steve bannon trump
[1:26:28.600 --> 1:26:33.880]  we're all saying and branding it as as drudge has done properly the resistance to the globalist
[1:26:33.880 --> 1:26:38.680]  the resistance to this whole world government corporate system it's now out in the open and
[1:26:38.680 --> 1:26:43.640]  so now they're calling themselves the resistance to our president that's just our beachhead to
[1:26:43.640 --> 1:26:48.120]  try to take our country back yeah i think there should be a rule for the democrats resistance
[1:26:48.120 --> 1:26:54.840]  they should have to say it with a french accent you know because it is this really crazy notion
[1:26:54.840 --> 1:26:58.920]  that we don't live in a democracy i mean they're not calling it the opposition you know the tea
[1:26:58.920 --> 1:27:04.600]  party was a loyal opposition tea party was about people getting active doing something to change
[1:27:04.600 --> 1:27:09.400]  our government petitioning for the redress of grievances you know the old constitutional bit
[1:27:09.400 --> 1:27:14.440]  and the democrats lost one election and they're acting like we're occupied by a foreign power
[1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:19.480]  and you know they don't seem to be up to the ordinary task of just having a debate getting
[1:27:19.480 --> 1:27:24.440]  people together changing but that's because fundamentally they are servants of globalism
[1:27:24.440 --> 1:27:29.160]  that is a foreign takeover like briggs at the e you england never voted to join the e you
[1:27:29.160 --> 1:27:33.800]  how did make 90 percent of their laws they are the ones that are the occupiers that's why they're
[1:27:33.800 --> 1:27:40.520]  projecting on to us what they are well what's interesting is that democrats place more faith
[1:27:40.520 --> 1:27:44.760]  in certain global institutions than they do in our own institutions and that was a big part of
[1:27:44.760 --> 1:27:50.360]  the backlash against obama remember that when he approved the iran deal he went to the un security
[1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:54.840]  council before he went to congress and not only is that unconstitutional because the senate is
[1:27:54.840 --> 1:28:00.680]  supposed to ratify any treaties but it also tied the hands of congress because once he went to the
[1:28:00.680 --> 1:28:06.280]  un security council even if congress rejected the deal it was a done deal sure and you know that's
[1:28:06.280 --> 1:28:11.080]  just unbelievable he remember whenever on several deals he would say that he was going to do stuff
[1:28:11.080 --> 1:28:16.360]  in europe with russia and and and then also in syria and also in libya and he would tell congress
[1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:22.200]  well i don't need your authorization i have nato's authorization right well how about the
[1:28:22.200 --> 1:28:26.280]  people of the check republic i mean he went there after he got elected gave a big speech about how
[1:28:26.280 --> 1:28:31.320]  he stood with them and their fight against tyranny and so forth and then he just pulled the rug out
[1:28:31.320 --> 1:28:35.960]  from under them on missile defense same thing with the polish government he called the polish
[1:28:35.960 --> 1:28:39.640]  leader in the middle of the night to tell him he had abandoned the treaty we had with them
[1:28:39.640 --> 1:28:43.960]  on missile defense i mean he did this kind of stuff to america's allies all the time
[1:28:43.960 --> 1:28:48.520]  and placed faith in in some of these global institutions and faith in in enemies frankly
[1:28:48.520 --> 1:28:54.520]  not just the iranian regime but others and and that's what people really felt angry about and
[1:28:54.520 --> 1:28:59.720]  you didn't have to care that much about foreign affairs to be pretty upset at the way that obama
[1:28:59.720 --> 1:29:04.920]  was violating the constitution in the service of some of his other goals sure and and and look
[1:29:04.920 --> 1:29:09.480]  it's just like the iranian director bad-mouthing america for not having open borders last night
[1:29:09.480 --> 1:29:14.680]  when they don't have open borders in iran and and they're all cheering you know some guy promoting
[1:29:14.680 --> 1:29:20.840]  iran at the oscars when none of those hollywood folks would be allowed to be free uh in in iran
[1:29:20.840 --> 1:29:25.880]  it it's truly just a bunch of american hating garbage we loyally want to make america better
[1:29:25.880 --> 1:29:30.040]  and criticize our government when it's wrong we don't hate the country or want to pull it down
[1:29:30.040 --> 1:29:35.400]  get the book at infowarstore.com how trump won the inside story of a revolution by joel b pollock

[1:29:59.720 --> 1:30:03.800]  a measuring stick for decorum in congress is approaching as president trump is set to
[1:30:03.800 --> 1:30:08.040]  deliver his first address to congress in an event classified by its dignity and demeanor
[1:30:08.040 --> 1:30:12.200]  the presidential address will certainly be shadowed by the democrat trolls who are planning on
[1:30:12.200 --> 1:30:17.000]  bringing guests such as muslim americans and dreamers in a sad attempt to tug at the heartstrings
[1:30:17.000 --> 1:30:22.040]  of america's electorate and in an attempt to cast trump as the bad guy so instead of concern for
[1:30:22.040 --> 1:30:26.120]  their constituents in the states and counties that they represent they're out casting nets in a
[1:30:26.120 --> 1:30:30.600]  search effort to find political pawns they can use against trump in the psychological battle of
[1:30:30.600 --> 1:30:35.800]  optics this is also an opportunity for trump to again sound the sirens of nationalism against
[1:30:35.800 --> 1:30:40.680]  globalism and america first policies that will bring jobs back to america info wars will have

[1:33:01.560 --> 1:33:10.120]  montgomery i had my guitar on my back when a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac
[1:33:11.160 --> 1:33:19.560]  he was dressed like 1950 half drunk and hollow eyed he said it's a long walk to nashfield would
[1:33:19.560 --> 1:33:27.720]  you like to ride waging war on corruption it's alex jones coming to you live from the front
[1:33:27.720 --> 1:33:36.120]  lines of the info war in the front seat it turned on the radio and them sad old songs coming out
[1:33:36.120 --> 1:33:42.840]  of them speakers were solid contra gold then i noticed the stranger was ghost white pear when
[1:33:42.840 --> 1:33:50.360]  he asked me for a light and i knew there was something strange about this ride it is so
[1:33:51.480 --> 1:34:01.320]  fitting i think the word they use is apropos that they spend the entire three plus hour long
[1:34:01.320 --> 1:34:16.360]  super boring elitists hollywood event that is the oscars and at the end of it they couldn't
[1:34:16.360 --> 1:34:24.680]  even get who the actual winner was right and perfectly the name of the film that they get
[1:34:24.680 --> 1:34:32.920]  wrong or the name of the film that they give the award to is called la la land just last week i was
[1:34:32.920 --> 1:34:40.680]  saying they are the delusionals and they live in la la land that nancy polosi and the hollywood
[1:34:40.680 --> 1:34:46.920]  crew and all of them live in la la land they live in allison wonderland we've used all those
[1:34:46.920 --> 1:34:56.520]  terms and then literally living in la la land they give la la land the award what is the
[1:34:56.520 --> 1:35:00.360]  definition of apropos i tell you i got the crew on their toes out there they're so fast
[1:35:00.360 --> 1:35:03.400]  we ought to go to the definition of apropos before i play this clip and then give the toll
[1:35:03.400 --> 1:35:07.800]  free number out i want to talk to first time callers i did yesterday a lot of great callers
[1:35:07.800 --> 1:35:11.560]  i want to talk about what do you think trump does to continue on to fight the globalist
[1:35:11.560 --> 1:35:17.320]  is he not delivering i want to talk to folks that uh if you disagree with trump think somehow he's
[1:35:17.320 --> 1:35:23.560]  sold out we're not censoring your calls i want to talk to hillary supporters i mean are you
[1:35:23.560 --> 1:35:29.400]  still hillary supporters after all the things we know apropos with reference to concerning
[1:35:29.400 --> 1:35:36.120]  she remarked apropos of the initiative it's not going to stop the abuse used to state a speaker's
[1:35:36.120 --> 1:35:42.200]  belief that someone's comments or acts are unrelated to any previous discussion or situation very
[1:35:42.200 --> 1:35:47.400]  appropriate to a particular situation that's i don't think that's apropos that's a different word
[1:35:49.320 --> 1:35:53.320]  i've because again i go out my memory with words every once in a while i'm wrong about their
[1:35:53.320 --> 1:36:01.800]  definition but apropos means like someone deserved it or like somebody hurt somebody so they had
[1:36:01.800 --> 1:36:07.320]  instant karma very appropriate to particular situation so i guess that is the right definition
[1:36:08.440 --> 1:36:11.000]  it's like instant karma basically is what it is
[1:36:13.480 --> 1:36:20.280]  instant karma everybody knows that term you let your dog crap in your neighbor's yard
[1:36:23.080 --> 1:36:30.200]  and then your toilet overflows an hour later that's apropos so i was correct with the definition
[1:36:30.200 --> 1:36:39.880]  thank you guys the toll free number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-2599-231
[1:36:41.880 --> 1:36:45.880]  i've looked at what trump's doing and he couldn't be doing a better job trying to execute what he's
[1:36:45.880 --> 1:36:51.320]  doing undermining the fake media exposing him as liars as enemies of the country explain to
[1:36:51.320 --> 1:36:56.440]  the american people how we've been captured by globalism and how we've been sold off to the
[1:36:56.440 --> 1:37:01.640]  highest bidder by corrupt elites and how we have elites in LA and new york that are waging war
[1:37:01.640 --> 1:37:07.320]  against the american people and then he's not just using that rhetoric he's actually going after them
[1:37:08.280 --> 1:37:12.120]  and he's actually creating record small business creation in just 40-something days
[1:37:12.120 --> 1:37:16.120]  and two trillion in the stock market and trying to get big banks to loan to small businesses
[1:37:16.120 --> 1:37:21.480]  he's doing everything you do to transfer power back to the states back to main street and back to
[1:37:21.480 --> 1:37:31.240]  the people toll free number to join us 800-2599-231 but i have actually been out to hollywood i was
[1:37:31.240 --> 1:37:36.920]  never that obsessed with it like most people but you know when i was 20 years old i think it was
[1:37:36.920 --> 1:37:42.040]  done if a girlfriend you know was reading people magazine that's not the real world that's there
[1:37:42.040 --> 1:37:48.680]  from madison avenue to make you feel small and to sell you a bunch of products that you don't need or
[1:37:48.680 --> 1:37:55.320]  don't want that's there to make you think these are really cool people so you'll culturally follow
[1:37:55.320 --> 1:38:00.120]  their ideas that are the opposite of what is needed to have a successful life
[1:38:02.440 --> 1:38:09.080]  but you look at them now a bunch of disheveled mentally ill twisted unhappy nobodies in most
[1:38:09.080 --> 1:38:16.280]  cases most of them are running from hollywood if they've got a soul the whole franchise system
[1:38:16.280 --> 1:38:22.120]  is falling apart it's being bought up by the authoritarian kingpins of communist china
[1:38:23.320 --> 1:38:28.840]  but they still arrogantly sit there and lecture everybody and say america's hated now because
[1:38:28.840 --> 1:38:33.640]  of donald trump america is hated many places in the world because the globalists have used our blood
[1:38:33.640 --> 1:38:38.520]  our treasure our name on the crimes they've committed and in many cases we've been used to
[1:38:38.520 --> 1:38:44.280]  execute those crimes and that's wrong and trump's trying to reverse that but of course you blame him
[1:38:44.280 --> 1:38:50.120]  for what you've done now to some people in the world think they can just come here and have
[1:38:50.120 --> 1:38:54.040]  everything paid for and little you know have their babies for free and all the rest of it and so
[1:38:54.040 --> 1:38:59.800]  they're mad at trump yeah that's true and those people are delusional so they can join the rest
[1:38:59.800 --> 1:39:06.520]  of you in a la la land with the delusionals we're the deplorables to those that live in the land of
[1:39:06.520 --> 1:39:15.400]  delusion secret ballots duplicate envelopes armguards and a star studded finale so how did the fine

[1:39:53.720 --> 1:39:57.560]  and why would trump attend the academy awards why would he attend the winehouse
[1:39:57.560 --> 1:40:01.720]  correspondence dinner when he's the guy that would bring ratings to it and it's all about him
[1:40:06.200 --> 1:40:10.600]  epic oscar mistake fade on away warren baby announced wrong person

[1:45:42.280 --> 1:45:49.480]  that's right intelligence sources confirm unnamed that's what we say intelligence sources confirm
[1:45:50.760 --> 1:45:55.880]  you know oscar screw up intelligence sources confirm and then under it real big russia did it
[1:45:56.520 --> 1:46:03.480]  absolutely russia did it that is pure genius mike go ahead yeah i frequently shop over at
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:07.320]  sportsman's warehouse and uh you know a bunch of other guns stores and i'm starting to see
[1:46:07.320 --> 1:46:12.200]  these little twits out there trying to buy handguns and rifles and it's honestly good to see some
[1:46:12.200 --> 1:46:17.480]  manhood rise in album because the purple socks and other things aren't just indicating the most
[1:46:17.480 --> 1:46:21.800]  manly hood album but uh well let's bring up what your little let's bring up what you're talking
[1:46:21.800 --> 1:46:25.720]  about for listeners that don't know mainstream news reports the last two months since trump got
[1:46:25.720 --> 1:46:31.080]  elected or three months that record guns sales with with quote liberals and they say you can't
[1:46:31.080 --> 1:46:35.640]  trust the government you know they may come after us we've got to defend ourselves now it's twisted
[1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:41.160]  but at least they get the second amendment and 1776 an understanding that yes we the people have
[1:46:41.160 --> 1:46:46.360]  a right as a counterbalance even if it's twisted even if it's misguided even if they're going after
[1:46:46.360 --> 1:46:51.960]  the very thing uh you know that they claim they've discovered it shows they finally understand
[1:46:51.960 --> 1:46:58.120]  it's about self defense it's about individual rights it's about the individual not about some
[1:46:58.120 --> 1:47:03.560]  great collective state you worship they worship the state before now that their enemy is in control
[1:47:03.560 --> 1:47:08.040]  of the state at some level they are having the come to jesus moment where they are now getting
[1:47:08.040 --> 1:47:14.120]  guns as a check and balance against an out-of-control state the circle is now complete yes it's a
[1:47:14.120 --> 1:47:20.680]  beautiful thing go ahead yeah it's uh it's it's becoming the new trendy thing amongst liberals
[1:47:20.680 --> 1:47:25.160]  quietly and the media doesn't really want to report on it and it's quite it's quite funny this
[1:47:25.160 --> 1:47:29.320]  should be interesting in time because i don't know what the media is going to do when trumps
[1:47:29.320 --> 1:47:34.520]  actually like by all these people because i just feel like the tides going to turn here real soon
[1:47:34.520 --> 1:47:39.960]  and that these people are going to be facing the monster that they created and um it's going to be
[1:47:39.960 --> 1:47:44.760]  big trouble for them here real soon when it becomes trendy to like trump to like guns to like freedom
[1:47:44.760 --> 1:47:51.880]  to you know just like security and just the far as prosperous country great points great caller god
[1:47:51.880 --> 1:47:56.200]  bless you thank you mike i love callers they bring up points i wouldn't have gotten to let's put that
[1:47:56.200 --> 1:48:00.440]  back on screen for radio listeners i want to read it to people tv viewers obviously see the crew
[1:48:00.440 --> 1:48:05.720]  pull up articles as we speak why us liberals are now buying guns to bbc we print me that place thank
[1:48:05.720 --> 1:48:09.000]  you i never really addressed this properly i've talked about it some we should do a whole report
[1:48:09.880 --> 1:48:12.440]  about how they're finally getting it they're finally understanding
[1:48:14.520 --> 1:48:19.560]  now there she is i think shooting a what a ruger 22 if i'm looking at that but whatever that's a good
[1:48:19.560 --> 1:48:23.720]  that's a good little beginner guns a fun little planking gun the point is is that
[1:48:23.720 --> 1:48:28.840]  that they finally understand why there's a second amendment even though they're misguided
[1:48:30.920 --> 1:48:36.760]  and the media actually has been reporting on the fact that this is going on so welcome to the club
[1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:43.080]  folks welcome you finally are starting to get so whacked out that the circle has gone all the way
[1:48:43.080 --> 1:48:48.040]  around you're actually coming back towards reality now you're going to go out and shoot guns meet
[1:48:48.040 --> 1:48:52.840]  like-minded people you're going to be around conservatives patriots libertarians just pro human
[1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:57.240]  folks pro human empowerment movement and i guarantee you the next step is you're going
[1:48:57.240 --> 1:49:04.040]  to convert to reality just like i've taken out countless libtards and i call them libtards
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:08.520]  because they are liberal they're uninformed they're very retarded historically and culturally
[1:49:08.520 --> 1:49:13.720]  and within minutes of shooting bullseye they're saying why couldn't i do this i'm not a bad person
[1:49:13.720 --> 1:49:20.760]  it's true only criminals have guns if i don't this is incredible it's instant it's victorious
[1:49:20.760 --> 1:49:26.840]  it's always the same if you can get them out then they learn proper safety proper stowage and then
[1:49:26.840 --> 1:49:32.840]  they begin to believe that they could be free as well and then they understand yeah pierce morgan
[1:49:32.840 --> 1:49:37.160]  has a bodyguard and an armed defense at his house but he doesn't want me to have a gun
[1:49:38.120 --> 1:49:40.760]  michael moore does too that's not right that doesn't make sense
[1:49:42.680 --> 1:49:44.440]  eric in indiana you're on the air go ahead
[1:49:44.440 --> 1:49:52.760]  like the first time caller a long time listener um just wanted to touch base with you on a subject
[1:49:52.760 --> 1:49:58.760]  here a lot of people were uh i haven't really heard much on is uh we heard spicer the other
[1:49:58.760 --> 1:50:04.920]  day talking about enforcing the laws on recreational marijuana now with jeff sessions in
[1:50:05.480 --> 1:50:11.880]  everybody knows he's a big uh drug war advocate you know fighting fighting against the devil's
[1:50:11.880 --> 1:50:17.640]  lettuce and all that and um what if what if we could get trump to uh maybe reschedule it
[1:50:18.760 --> 1:50:26.120]  that way he can appease the evangel the evangelist you know that he is fighting you know the law
[1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:34.120]  or uh ruling the law but uh then you know he could uh appease the leftist who and uh you know
[1:50:34.120 --> 1:50:39.640]  the trendies and everybody that are all pro marijuana and get them on board with states right
[1:50:39.640 --> 1:50:42.520]  now i hear you let me make a point on this you're making a great point eric thank you
[1:50:44.920 --> 1:50:50.120]  trump was wrong in my view about torture he now talked to sessions he now talked to um
[1:50:51.240 --> 1:50:56.520]  mattis and agrees that the policy shouldn't be torture okay he's been a little bit wrong
[1:50:56.520 --> 1:51:00.600]  on surveillance now as he learns more about it how it was used against him illegally he's starting
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:05.960]  to shift towards a better position but he's americana he means well he goes off his own
[1:51:05.960 --> 1:51:10.840]  common sense and that's why he doesn't flop flop when he learns he's been too extreme or wrong
[1:51:10.840 --> 1:51:16.600]  he moves towards common sense now on the subject of alcohol he had a brother that drunk himself
[1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:23.960]  to death that's admitted and so trump is really anti-alcohol now he's got kids that have a wine
[1:51:23.960 --> 1:51:28.040]  company i don't think a few glasses of wine is bad for him it's been proven to be good for you
[1:51:28.040 --> 1:51:32.200]  so he's you know he's he's moderate on it but extreme in his own personal views but he believes
[1:51:32.200 --> 1:51:37.320]  you have a right he's seen what marijuana does to some people that are under motivated in terms of
[1:51:37.320 --> 1:51:40.600]  into people in their mom's basements it's very destructive for some people has a lot of great
[1:51:40.600 --> 1:51:45.480]  medical uses helps a lot of people that are high strong studies show it's much better than prozac
[1:51:45.480 --> 1:51:51.240]  and you know other stuff but it can be destructive you know if you're an alpha male you know athlete
[1:51:51.240 --> 1:51:56.200]  like joe rogan who's super high strong so marijuana you know is good for you uh but if you're somebody
[1:51:56.200 --> 1:51:59.960]  that's already not motivated you're gonna end up being a zombie i mean it's it's true i'm for
[1:51:59.960 --> 1:52:05.480]  decriminalization so our prisons aren't filled with nonviolent people i do believe it should be a
[1:52:05.480 --> 1:52:10.280]  states issue obama said it would be but double crossed that and increased marijuana enforcement
[1:52:10.280 --> 1:52:15.720]  federally i agree that marijuana should be decriminalized and should be available for
[1:52:15.720 --> 1:52:21.640]  recreational use in adults because it's a free country it's a free world and if you can go
[1:52:21.640 --> 1:52:25.560]  drink a bottle of jack daniels it's not good for you we should have to pay for it when you're you
[1:52:25.560 --> 1:52:30.360]  know your liver fails but that's your right to do that and if you want to blast your brain and
[1:52:30.360 --> 1:52:36.840]  turn yourself into a zombie with a super high-powered marijuana they got that's your right i want our
[1:52:36.840 --> 1:52:43.560]  police going after rapist and arsonist and criminals and white collar fraudsters and people that
[1:52:43.560 --> 1:52:48.680]  write you know hot checks over and over again and people that run scams and illegal aliens that have
[1:52:48.680 --> 1:52:54.760]  committed crimes i don't want them running around looking you know for marijuana in your car now
[1:52:54.760 --> 1:53:01.960]  that said i know that a lot of drug use take prescription stuff is a disease it is an addiction
[1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:05.640]  you can have hillbilly heroin a doctor puts you on that's the same thing as heroin that
[1:53:05.640 --> 1:53:12.520]  shipped in from afghanistan the two are the same and i think if you catch people with it
[1:53:12.520 --> 1:53:15.640]  illegally it should be taken away but i think there should be big penalties because they're
[1:53:15.640 --> 1:53:20.440]  addicted now if you're selling it to kids that's different i think there should be serious felony
[1:53:20.440 --> 1:53:25.160]  laws about drugs and kids because that's contributing to the delinquency of minors so the drug laws are
[1:53:25.160 --> 1:53:29.720]  really pretty common sense if you if you want to have them that way but they're not you sell drugs
[1:53:29.720 --> 1:53:34.280]  legally legal to kids it's a very very stiff penalty because you're contributing to the
[1:53:34.280 --> 1:53:39.720]  delinquency of minor and you're getting into inside a family and it should be back to the states
[1:53:40.680 --> 1:53:45.640]  but i agree to be a big victory for trump if he moderated sessions some sessions is great on so
[1:53:45.640 --> 1:53:49.800]  many points but he's one of those older guys from alabama that thinks catch him with a marijuana
[1:53:49.800 --> 1:53:57.160]  cigarette throw him under the jail come on come on get me moderate about it half the population
[1:53:57.160 --> 1:54:02.200]  smokes marijuana in this country we've chosen we like it that's what's going on i personally
[1:54:02.200 --> 1:54:07.080]  don't like marijuana very rarely smoke it because russia knew that sometimes it feels great and i
[1:54:07.080 --> 1:54:12.440]  can think on it other times i'm the only time i'm fearful and i don't ever have fear or anxiety
[1:54:12.440 --> 1:54:16.840]  really i smoke marijuana i start worrying about my kids everybody around me i start
[1:54:16.840 --> 1:54:25.000]  being being paranoid i don't like it other times i smoke and i want to go to sleep that's why
[1:54:25.000 --> 1:54:29.400]  i get talked into it every few years it's just you know it's like one time it's okay other times
[1:54:29.400 --> 1:54:35.960]  it's horrible but it doesn't matter some people it helps so that's what i stand on marijuana
[1:54:37.720 --> 1:54:42.120]  other drugs need to be decriminalized because making them illegal makes them black market
[1:54:42.120 --> 1:54:47.240]  and they're full of poison they're full of garbage they're full of additives it's super dangerous
[1:54:47.240 --> 1:54:51.320]  and young people shouldn't think it's cool by the way if you decriminalize every european study
[1:54:51.320 --> 1:54:55.400]  shows drug use goes down because there's not a black market in it and it's not seen as cool
[1:54:55.400 --> 1:54:59.880]  underground anymore and that and then the young people can't be involved then it because there's
[1:54:59.880 --> 1:55:06.280]  no money and the gangs can't either so i've done my research that's where i stand and i think
[1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:10.520]  that's really what trump should do about it i totally agree with you it'd be a big victory
[1:55:10.520 --> 1:55:14.680]  for trump to do that something obama wouldn't do and i think you should leave it to the states and
[1:55:14.680 --> 1:55:18.920]  say as long as you're not giving drugs to kids it and as long as you're not selling it you're
[1:55:18.920 --> 1:55:25.400]  distributing as long as it's for your own use uh then uh it should not be a uh serious crime
[1:55:28.840 --> 1:55:31.800]  and then make it where you can get it legally and if they catch you with it illegally then it's
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:37.080]  like a ticket that's decriminalization i do not think it should be wild wild west is you know
[1:55:37.080 --> 1:55:43.640]  marijuana everywhere believe me i mean i was in a while back two years ago i was in denver
[1:55:43.640 --> 1:55:47.720]  they just legalized it i said let me go to one of these things and i went to dispensary and i went
[1:55:47.720 --> 1:55:54.360]  in there and i bought some marijuana and i smoked it and i mean i laid down at five o'clock and woke
[1:55:54.360 --> 1:55:58.760]  up at midnight i mean it was just like good god this is like drinking a half bottle of whiskey
[1:55:58.760 --> 1:56:08.440]  so it's high powered hot power and i really did go like cops take drugs you know and test
[1:56:08.440 --> 1:56:12.280]  so they know what it feels like so they can recognize it i literally have taken marijuana
[1:56:12.840 --> 1:56:17.480]  to to know what it's like and compared to stuff i smoked a few times in high school it's
[1:56:19.560 --> 1:56:23.960]  15 20 times stronger okay i've digressed see caller brings up a great point i do a 10 minute

[2:01:38.520 --> 2:01:43.240]  were for hillary they're in the trump campaign how are you feeling now after trump really delivered
[2:01:43.240 --> 2:01:47.800]  because they would always say oh he's a rich guy he won't really try to get jobs back he won't
[2:01:47.800 --> 2:01:53.800]  really try to get small business loans he won't really do his promises he's already gotten a lot
[2:01:53.800 --> 2:01:59.480]  of what he said he would do through and he's battling the rest of it steadfastly and calling out the
[2:01:59.480 --> 2:02:05.560]  enemy media calling out the fake stream media as the enemy could you ever ask for that i mean you
[2:02:05.560 --> 2:02:11.640]  cannot say that trump is the establishment he is the antithesis of that but maybe you want to call
[2:02:11.640 --> 2:02:17.960]  in and tell me why i'm wrong i know a lot of so-called libertarians and other people that just
[2:02:18.600 --> 2:02:22.760]  they get intimidated by all the anti-trump stuff they want to be on the fence and kind of bash
[2:02:22.760 --> 2:02:28.360]  trump and also support trump or sit there and do all this and almost every time their criticism of
[2:02:28.360 --> 2:02:36.920]  trump isn't real it isn't real oh look he's got three golden sacks people in there yeah who all got
[2:02:36.920 --> 2:02:45.480]  a background to fight in the new world order but he has had some of his appointees openly
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:49.880]  criticize him and turn against him but shows how he's completely surrounded but he's got the truth
[2:02:49.880 --> 2:02:54.040]  on his side and if we the people get behind him nothing on earth can stop us with god's blessing
[2:02:54.760 --> 2:03:00.280]  well keen in our zone you're on the air thanks for holding yeah thanks alex i appreciate your
[2:03:00.280 --> 2:03:05.320]  time today and i'd like to thank you for your dedication and your sacrifice that you've given
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:09.800]  to this nation through your show i've been following you since you pulled the covers on gohemia and
[2:03:09.800 --> 2:03:14.520]  grove and uh kind of been addicted to it ever since at first i have to tell you i was a little
[2:03:14.520 --> 2:03:19.960]  skeptical but everything that you've said uh since way back then has come to pass so that's
[2:03:19.960 --> 2:03:26.360]  how i know that's the litmus test that you're definitely for real and this is an exciting
[2:03:26.360 --> 2:03:31.320]  time to be alive you've covered so many topics uh that it's hard to stay focused so i've written
[2:03:31.320 --> 2:03:36.920]  down some notes uh a brief history i started with the 82nd airborne division and uh gotten some
[2:03:36.920 --> 2:03:42.920]  trouble uh later on in life and i subsequently became a minister of the gospel uh so one of the
[2:03:42.920 --> 2:03:49.000]  questions that you had asked earlier in the show was what can trump do uh to continue his agenda
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:53.640]  and to make it with this head above water with everybody against him i think what's important
[2:03:53.640 --> 2:04:00.200]  for the listeners to understand is that everybody isn't against him there is a huge majority of the
[2:04:00.200 --> 2:04:03.800]  populist that you know i'm not i'm not going to cut you off start over when we come back in the next
[2:04:03.800 --> 2:04:09.720]  segment because i tend to harp on the fact that at the top the corrupt elites and the power structure
[2:04:09.720 --> 2:04:13.720]  is against him but when you get in the military the intelligence agencies the general public
[2:04:13.720 --> 2:04:18.200]  most people support him and they're trying to make us think he's isolated but i do want to point out
[2:04:18.200 --> 2:04:25.400]  he is surrounded at his level by a bunch of scum and and it is very lion-like it only makes me admire
[2:04:25.400 --> 2:04:30.040]  trump more uh because few people are ever been in a position like this i mean i'm in the position of
[2:04:30.040 --> 2:04:35.880]  being surrounded but you know when you at at at this level but trump said even another level
[2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:40.520]  surrounded and only makes you want to defend him so i'll come back to you a keen to to flesh all
[2:04:40.520 --> 2:04:47.160]  this out to talk about this on the other side uh and then uh smith and uh rob and james and matthew
[2:04:47.160 --> 2:04:53.400]  and many others i'm alex jones info wars dot com president planet dot com are the urls they hate
[2:04:53.400 --> 2:04:56.760]  and they're trying to block and ban so you know what to do we'll be back
[2:04:56.760 --> 2:05:03.880]  the united states foreign policy and engagement with syria has been a disaster and it may start
[2:05:03.880 --> 2:05:08.760]  and end with john mccain four years mccain has been a buffer between the middle east and the united
[2:05:08.760 --> 2:05:14.040]  states mccain took a rare trip to syria in 2013 he met with so-called moderate rebels obama was
[2:05:14.040 --> 2:05:17.960]  bankrolling in army it turned out that these moderate rebels were the ones destabilizing the
[2:05:17.960 --> 2:05:22.600]  region and could even be tied to isis but of course this would fit the foreign policy of the obama
[2:05:22.600 --> 2:05:27.080]  administration and the clinton state department which wanted bashar Assad removed from power last
[2:05:27.080 --> 2:05:32.120]  week mccain took another rare and secret trip to syria a spokesperson for mccain said he was there
[2:05:32.120 --> 2:05:37.480]  to visit with us ground forces to discuss plans to defeat isle isle not isis they were sure to
[2:05:37.480 --> 2:05:43.560]  clarify now how coincidental upon mccain's return to the us news stories everywhere are talking about
[2:05:43.560 --> 2:05:48.600]  more us ground forces being sent to syria john mccain is a detriment to our nation the middle east
[2:05:48.600 --> 2:05:53.480]  and peace on this planet he needs to be removed from any unelected duties and it is upon the people

[2:10:53.960 --> 2:10:59.640]  notion that hillary has somehow been an advocate for women no bill rapes them physically and then
[2:10:59.640 --> 2:11:05.480]  hillary rapes them psychologically i hope the enemies of this broadcast when you lie about us

[2:11:19.320 --> 2:11:24.600]  accountability it is the most corrupt degenerate criminal government in american history
[2:11:27.960 --> 2:11:33.160]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[2:11:33.160 --> 2:11:37.880]  we're proud of now moving forward toward the barrier the police have been telling everybody
[2:11:37.880 --> 2:11:44.840]  they're going to shoot if we don't move back their defeat will be ultimately a crushing one
[2:11:47.480 --> 2:11:50.120]  and that promo is a year old
[2:11:53.560 --> 2:11:59.080]  a year old nine months later president trump won the presidency
[2:11:59.080 --> 2:12:05.480]  you heard lord montan at the end and i believe the defeat in the end will be a crushing defeat
[2:12:06.520 --> 2:12:10.360]  we have history on our side we're the real classical
[2:12:12.760 --> 2:12:16.600]  liberals now roger stone has some breaking news he's going to pop in for five minutes
[2:12:16.600 --> 2:12:21.640]  he's at an airport go ahead and call him on his phone guys i'm going to go back to wakene
[2:12:21.640 --> 2:12:26.200]  formally in the army in the airborne he was getting into the fact he's now a pastor
[2:12:26.200 --> 2:12:29.640]  he was making the point that alex you keep saying trump surrounded which is true
[2:12:29.640 --> 2:12:33.320]  at the higher echelons the democratic and republican party the top globalist
[2:12:34.040 --> 2:12:39.000]  but with the people especially the military the intelligence agencies and people lower level
[2:12:39.000 --> 2:12:43.240]  incorporations but in management positions they're almost all for trump and that's why
[2:12:43.240 --> 2:12:47.720]  you see the stock market exploding it's why you see so much happening we have the intel everywhere
[2:12:47.720 --> 2:12:52.120]  folks it's incredible this is like fight club so wakene go ahead and make your points thank you
[2:12:52.120 --> 2:12:58.120]  for holding no problem thank you alex so as i was watching the evolution of this revolution
[2:12:58.120 --> 2:13:04.920]  it became quite clear uh that the insurmountable obstacles that trump was facing uh dictated
[2:13:04.920 --> 2:13:11.720]  the very essence of this struggle this nation is facing what what is happening is on a spiritual
[2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:17.560]  level yes we are engaged in physical battles here on has it not ever been more cut and dry
[2:13:17.560 --> 2:13:22.920]  with open marches and devil worshipers saying satan killed trump and trump invoking god and
[2:13:22.920 --> 2:13:27.880]  bringing god back in and then now all this providence golden touch that trump has everything
[2:13:27.880 --> 2:13:34.040]  they touch blows up that is exactly my point and you had asked earlier what can trump do
[2:13:34.040 --> 2:13:39.640]  to continue uh his agenda and that is the very essence of this whole movement and the invoking
[2:13:39.640 --> 2:13:45.000]  of the birds right and bringing god back into this if if trump can get up to the bully pulpit
[2:13:45.000 --> 2:13:49.880]  and call the people back to repentance and yes i'm going to catch flak for this but remember
[2:13:49.880 --> 2:13:55.160]  i'm a minister now but i wasn't 10 years ago i was something else and if it wasn't for the saving
[2:13:55.160 --> 2:13:59.800]  grace of jesus christ that was allowed me to be able to be the man that i am today i wouldn't be
[2:13:59.800 --> 2:14:05.400]  here talking to you so if trump can just get that focus to get up there and have the courage
[2:14:05.400 --> 2:14:11.400]  to call people this nation back to repentance god will flood this area with the the prosperity
[2:14:11.400 --> 2:14:17.640]  that we had never even you could possibly exist and that is my point absolutely and look trump
[2:14:17.640 --> 2:14:22.520]  has been a christian for a long time but he can feel the spirit now rising he god is really moving
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:27.080]  the holy spirit in trump and i've had me almost know the conversation i've had with trump we've
[2:14:27.080 --> 2:14:32.600]  talked about the spirit feeling god how he wants to help christianity not be persecuted that's what
[2:14:32.600 --> 2:14:37.160]  is really near and dear to trump's heart and you know it's just like god works mysterious ways the
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:42.120]  most unlikely of places donald trump he's doing and i notice hillary desperately this week is
[2:14:42.120 --> 2:14:47.240]  sort of saying god bless and trying to invoke god again because they wanted to get rid of all that
[2:14:47.240 --> 2:14:51.320]  now that they're panicking she wants to keep democrats that are on the fence from going to
[2:14:51.320 --> 2:14:57.720]  this movement because they understand how powerful this is she's that's going to blow up in her face
[2:14:57.720 --> 2:15:02.680]  she can't invoke the name of the living god that's that well she didn't say jesus christ she just said
[2:15:02.680 --> 2:15:07.800]  god bless you and and it looked very very strange so so they know what's happening they're panicked
[2:15:07.800 --> 2:15:14.280]  right now they better be panicked thank you alex i appreciate you allow me to come on here and talk
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:18.760]  to you uh you're you're great just keep up the good work we'll be praying for you as well and
[2:15:18.760 --> 2:15:23.160]  we we raise you up in church as well as the president and i encourage all the ministers
[2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:27.960]  out there listening i know there are some to just get in the trenches every morning in prayer and
[2:15:27.960 --> 2:15:33.480]  put their hand on the screen and pray over these the fantastic news articles you put out that's how
[2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:38.840]  we do and wage battle here in the spirit realm well it's funny you say that the lucifer is the
[2:15:38.840 --> 2:15:42.600]  prince of the power of the air and they make fun of preachers putting their hands on the television
[2:15:42.600 --> 2:15:48.200]  or whatever but truly it's an electromagnetic system and the point is is just visualizing
[2:15:48.200 --> 2:15:53.640]  the fact that we're all together and we're moving forward and we're strong and we love god and and
[2:15:53.640 --> 2:15:58.440]  we are going to see those that aren't completely turned over to evil the scales come off their eyes
[2:15:59.480 --> 2:16:05.560]  like you know paul on the road to demascus back when he was soul and just hoping that they get
[2:16:05.560 --> 2:16:09.640]  knocked from their horse and you know get back to really understanding the truth of what's happening
[2:16:09.640 --> 2:16:15.400]  because as i'm putting words in your mouth i'd imagine you were pretty messed up maybe ptsd
[2:16:15.400 --> 2:16:19.960]  pretty scared pretty upset maybe turning towards the dark side after a lot of combat or something
[2:16:19.960 --> 2:16:24.840]  and that god and christ spirit and the holy spirit was able to turn you around and make you a new man
[2:16:24.840 --> 2:16:28.920]  and you know putting god in charge you know literally coming into your spirit coming into your
[2:16:28.920 --> 2:16:32.520]  soul you know redirecting all of that and cleansing you of that is that what happened
[2:16:33.560 --> 2:16:37.640]  well that's very interesting you should ask that i wrote a book and if you don't mind i'll
[2:16:37.640 --> 2:16:43.320]  i'll promote it real quick it's called remember the prisoners he came to set the captives free
[2:16:43.320 --> 2:16:48.440]  it's uh my true story of how i came to christ and god the deliverance i was involved in drugs
[2:16:48.440 --> 2:16:54.920]  and alcohol and crime and everything in between and and it was it was god jesus came in personally
[2:16:54.920 --> 2:16:59.400]  and met me in that prison cell and woke me up and gave me the revelation you've heard the word
[2:16:59.400 --> 2:17:05.640]  epiphany well epiphany actually is translated a divine revelation and that's when the spirit of
[2:17:05.640 --> 2:17:11.240]  god actually contacts the spirit of man who we were created in and makes right and the ultimate
[2:17:11.240 --> 2:17:15.560]  sin is turning is turning down that spirit when it actually comes to you god bless you my friend
[2:17:15.560 --> 2:17:19.720]  we never talked before i just couldn't see what he was saying and and it's the truth you're not
[2:17:19.720 --> 2:17:23.080]  going to find out these big churches now we're going to skip this break so we have time roger
[2:17:23.080 --> 2:17:27.080]  stone sent me a text and i was already aware of it i'd mentioned it earlier we should have made
[2:17:27.080 --> 2:17:31.880]  a bigger deal of it it just broke in the last hour no evidence of trump campaign contacts
[2:17:31.880 --> 2:17:35.880]  with russia the house intelligence committee probe into possible improper context between
[2:17:35.880 --> 2:17:40.440]  donald trump presidential campaign and russia has not found any evidence yet according to the republican
[2:17:40.440 --> 2:17:44.600]  committee shared i remember we were told two months before the campaign we were told on the
[2:17:44.600 --> 2:17:49.720]  day of the of the inauguration that they had the evidence and it was being given to congress and
[2:17:49.720 --> 2:17:53.880]  then congress keeps saying they won't give it to us well they finally gave it to them it's the same
[2:17:53.880 --> 2:18:01.480]  ci report we saw a four-year-old rt shows saying bad things about hillary when they call it hacking
[2:18:01.480 --> 2:18:05.320]  they mean russians didn't like hillary well a bunch of people didn't either but all the other media
[2:18:05.320 --> 2:18:09.960]  all the foreign governments piled on against trump it was a hundred to one msm against trump that's
[2:18:09.960 --> 2:18:15.960]  admitted a hundred to zero goldman sacks donations to hillary not the trump but we hear he's golden
[2:18:15.960 --> 2:18:21.160]  sacks and they kept saying roger stone's the kingpin he's with wikileaks he works for putin
[2:18:22.040 --> 2:18:26.920]  and they were gonna have congressional hearings in a month stone gets hit with polonium took killing
[2:18:26.920 --> 2:18:32.760]  he didn't get the full dose uh the cdc believes but it's polonium the fbi comes out to his house
[2:18:32.760 --> 2:18:39.080]  secret service all the nine yards you know to talk to about it he wants to testify to congress
[2:18:39.080 --> 2:18:42.520]  and see they wanted him dead so they can then have the hearings and blame it on stone but he
[2:18:42.520 --> 2:18:47.800]  didn't get the full dose this is incredible so just as stone said for month after month after
[2:18:47.800 --> 2:18:53.400]  month i never met never talked no emails total bull man afford total bull they had to wait till
[2:18:53.400 --> 2:18:59.880]  the national security advisor on december 15 general flinn talked to the russians about setting
[2:18:59.880 --> 2:19:04.200]  up phone calls with the president in official business and then he got run out because the
[2:19:04.200 --> 2:19:07.960]  russians said we want to talk about sanctions he said well you got to the president about that
[2:19:07.960 --> 2:19:11.800]  and they said well technically you said you'd talk about sanctions well of course i mentioned
[2:19:11.800 --> 2:19:17.880]  them but that wasn't talking about sanctions so he's gone now this is unbelievable so they're
[2:19:17.880 --> 2:19:22.040]  saying we haven't gotten the proof we've gotten all their documents there's not even phone calls
[2:19:22.040 --> 2:19:26.520]  there's nothing here but as we've written there's hillary getting money directly from putin not
[2:19:26.520 --> 2:19:29.480]  saying putin's even bad folks that's what right you're supposed to try to infiltrate other
[2:19:29.480 --> 2:19:34.040]  governments and influence them the point is it's hillary they're the ones it's coming out everywhere
[2:19:34.040 --> 2:19:39.080]  that's why they said he was the russian asset because if anybody is she's a chinese communist
[2:19:39.080 --> 2:19:43.640]  asset the guy that exposed all that's in hiding right now so this is all unraveling we're gonna
[2:19:43.640 --> 2:19:47.880]  get congressman kurt welden former head of the intelligence community on to break more of this
[2:19:47.880 --> 2:19:52.440]  he was on last week so roger steno you're jumping on a plane in like 10 minutes we're gonna go back
[2:19:52.440 --> 2:19:58.120]  to calls after that callers but this is this is big exactly what you said there is no proof
[2:19:58.120 --> 2:20:02.440]  you want to be before congress i think trump should call for the hearings himself and demand
[2:20:02.440 --> 2:20:07.880]  they have them to show what frauds they are they should also declassify all the documents in this
[2:20:07.880 --> 2:20:15.000]  matter uh well alex i'm at the airport here in miami i am on my way uh to uh washington to
[2:20:15.000 --> 2:20:21.320]  meet with my lawyers we were anticipating some action against the government because uh as you
[2:20:21.320 --> 2:20:31.000]  know uh according to the guardian the fysa secret fysa court uh ordered a warrant into uh to uh
[2:20:31.000 --> 2:20:38.360]  approve the surveillance of my tax phone my cell phone my tax my email all of my communications
[2:20:38.360 --> 2:20:45.720]  reportedly over a year ago uh which is now and as you know in the fysa court no no probable cause
[2:20:45.720 --> 2:20:50.360]  or evidence is required it's a political charge so they've heard us talk about what they really
[2:20:50.360 --> 2:20:55.720]  wanted president trump and strategy claiming you are russian agent allowed them the presidency
[2:20:55.720 --> 2:21:03.160]  obama to illegally spy on one of the unofficial uh advisors of his rival this is incredible
[2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:08.200]  criminal activity yeah i know it's way to reverse watergate in many ways because you
[2:21:08.200 --> 2:21:14.760]  could privy to all memos and campaign strategy items that i wrote of my own opinion all of my
[2:21:14.760 --> 2:21:19.160]  private communications plus all my personal information i mean who doesn't talk to their
[2:21:19.160 --> 2:21:25.880]  wife on email or well remember you got hacked you got hacked repeatedly so so it is outrage it's a
[2:21:25.880 --> 2:21:31.960]  suspension of the of our constitution as you know the fysa court rubber stands 99 percent of the
[2:21:31.960 --> 2:21:39.080]  government's request this was a fishing expedition and even the chairman said today that all the
[2:21:39.080 --> 2:21:45.480]  information regarding stone of cases back to media stories media stories that report something
[2:21:45.480 --> 2:21:51.320]  is happening but we can't find any evidence to this let's be clear they report on reports of reports
[2:21:51.320 --> 2:21:55.720]  and then and ring around the rosie never say where the evidence came from and then put out a
[2:21:55.720 --> 2:22:01.880]  30-something page report that has youtube videos on it saying look rt did a negative piece on hillary
[2:22:01.880 --> 2:22:08.280]  that's their proof that we're all russian agents yeah no so this is that this is a giant blow of
[2:22:08.280 --> 2:22:12.920]  course anyone who reads my book to making the president 2016 already knows this narrative
[2:22:12.920 --> 2:22:19.720]  understands because i i debunked the entire russian fraud right there in the book extensively uh
[2:22:19.720 --> 2:22:25.960]  as an ocean that you and i are in the service of food and this is an absurdity it's it's the new
[2:22:25.960 --> 2:22:30.680]  mccarty is well let me do this let me do this i want to make this particularly clear to everybody
[2:22:30.680 --> 2:22:34.920]  i know privately you told me you are planning lawsuits you have to do this for the for the
[2:22:34.920 --> 2:22:40.280]  country for yourself for trump for everybody to get back on the offense we know this is all a lie
[2:22:40.280 --> 2:22:45.640]  it's coming out it's a lie uh they need to have these hearings so you can go into congress and get
[2:22:45.640 --> 2:22:50.840]  your good name back they need to all correct what they've done or tell us who you're going to be forced
[2:22:50.840 --> 2:22:56.760]  to sue well here's the problem alex generally speaking a great man once told me don't sue people
[2:22:56.760 --> 2:23:02.440]  who buy a gang by the barrel on the other hand in the new age everybody has their own cannon
[2:23:02.440 --> 2:23:07.640]  they might not have a war uh you know i i frankly think the new york times in the washington post
[2:23:07.640 --> 2:23:14.440]  that misrepresented the situation on the basis of no evidence they were led down a uh loaded path by
[2:23:15.000 --> 2:23:21.080]  uh people who have fancy titles in the cia and others who have a higher credibility with them
[2:23:21.080 --> 2:23:30.600]  in operations uh and this is a classical classic uh uh intelligence agency mainstream media set up
[2:23:30.600 --> 2:23:36.920]  particularly with those two organs which they've had long control and influence it particularly the
[2:23:36.920 --> 2:23:43.480]  post and i should add they are now saying the head of the intelligence committee newness is now
[2:23:43.480 --> 2:23:49.960]  saying exactly what you've been saying for really six months but it got more intense three months ago
[2:23:49.960 --> 2:23:55.400]  saying we have communiques we're stoned manifold and some guy you don't even know are getting direct
[2:23:55.400 --> 2:24:00.440]  orders from the russians and are under russian command you keep saying this is total lies let
[2:24:00.440 --> 2:24:04.280]  me see it and they always just say they have reports of reports and they never release it
[2:24:04.280 --> 2:24:09.960]  and now the head of the intelligence committee says they have no evidence it's a pile of news
[2:24:09.960 --> 2:24:17.240]  articles all reporting on each other but no phone calls no phone calls no emails no nothing
[2:24:18.760 --> 2:24:25.800]  uh what's really amazing of course is the other night on msnbc i saw some swine named norm or
[2:24:25.800 --> 2:24:32.840]  ross cough predicting that i would be indicted and sent to prison so uh you know talk is cheap
[2:24:32.840 --> 2:24:39.560]  but all you've got are these uh battering nebobs of negativism on the far left who are who have
[2:24:39.560 --> 2:24:48.680]  made this whole from russia putin meme up from the get-go i mean i'm not sure what they showed
[2:24:48.680 --> 2:24:54.120]  the fights the court to convince them to give them this warrant to do to uh violate my civil
[2:24:54.120 --> 2:24:59.960]  liberties but was probably here with clinton press release well it'll all come out in court
[2:24:59.960 --> 2:25:03.320]  and that's the great part about depositions uh we've got to do this though because they're
[2:25:03.320 --> 2:25:07.560]  trying to bring the president down with these lies and as trump keeps saying release everything
[2:25:07.560 --> 2:25:12.680]  there's nothing here i don't even talk to the russians and the russians have the gdp of idli
[2:25:12.680 --> 2:25:17.080]  they've got a powerful military but that's it i'm i'm not bashing the russians but i mean it's a
[2:25:17.080 --> 2:25:22.600]  complete joke when the vatican and the eu and the communist chinese are openly telling us we
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:27.080]  can't have trump the saudi arabians give 20 percent of her campaign money i mean i really
[2:25:27.080 --> 2:25:31.640]  think we need to hear calls from sessions and others for criminal investigations of hillary
[2:25:31.640 --> 2:25:37.000]  when it's public that she's a communist chinese spy i mean if they want to make up this lie and get
[2:25:37.000 --> 2:25:41.400]  in this arena is it turn about fair play when when when really she's the agent
[2:25:45.000 --> 2:25:49.800]  all right i gotta hit my dick i understand you've got to go roger we'll talk to you again soon
[2:25:51.240 --> 2:25:56.680]  no there he goes i got too loud there as he's going to the tsa okay i want to go back to your
[2:25:56.680 --> 2:25:58.040]  phone calls it's just that
[2:26:02.520 --> 2:26:10.040]  these people are crazy it's the democratic party historically that has had the the russians
[2:26:11.560 --> 2:26:17.640]  funding them and involve them but that that went away by the 80s but there was some major russian
[2:26:17.640 --> 2:26:23.080]  connections with senator kennedy and people going and actually trying to get paid money by the russians
[2:26:23.080 --> 2:26:30.200]  to do things in congress really serious stuff and sex operatives russian sex operatives
[2:26:30.200 --> 2:26:36.600]  but by the 90s that all pretty much stopped since then the russians have been trying to make business
[2:26:36.600 --> 2:26:45.880]  deals that's how things really get done and then you look at what's happening now the communist
[2:26:45.880 --> 2:26:52.600]  chinese are very public about the fact that they are the biggest most powerful lobby outside of the
[2:26:52.600 --> 2:27:00.200]  military industrial complex lobby the big banking lobby there is an israel lobby it's very powerful
[2:27:00.200 --> 2:27:05.240]  but if you really look at things it's the communist chinese many cases allied with islamist groups
[2:27:06.280 --> 2:27:11.880]  that really are the muscle the brains and the funding i mean there are congresses estimated 10
[2:27:11.880 --> 2:27:15.880]  thousand communist chinese front companies i've got two or three articles a day i wasn't even looking
[2:27:15.880 --> 2:27:21.160]  for these just in the news about you know communist chinese front groups and colleges and you name it
[2:27:21.160 --> 2:27:27.080]  and schools and companies they set up for manufacturing to get other technology i mean they are in our
[2:27:27.080 --> 2:27:34.520]  business man they are in our business and they're just quietly beavering away to take over
[2:27:37.800 --> 2:27:41.160]  but not so quietly now they're in the news a lot saying you know what

[2:28:07.640 --> 2:28:12.200]  yeah putting people in mobile execution vans to criticize the government or taking buddhist
[2:28:12.200 --> 2:28:18.760]  that secretly practice their faith and killing them i mean this is crazy yeah scroll down there's

[2:30:03.640 --> 2:30:08.680]  deliver his first address to congress in an event classified by its dignity and demeanor the presidential

[2:30:12.920 --> 2:30:18.200]  as muslim americans and dreamers in a sad attempt to tug at the heartstrings of america's electorate
[2:30:18.200 --> 2:30:22.920]  and in an attempt to cast trump as the bad guy so instead of concern for their constituents in the
[2:30:22.920 --> 2:30:26.920]  states and counties that they represent they're out casting nets in a search effort to find
[2:30:26.920 --> 2:30:31.720]  political pawns they can use against trump in the psychological battle of optics this is also
[2:30:31.720 --> 2:30:36.920]  an opportunity for trump to again sound the sirens of nationalism against globalism and america

[2:40:13.080 --> 2:40:22.600]  phrase and it's kind of used as the rallying cry for for open immigration but there's a
[2:40:22.600 --> 2:40:30.600]  sentence before that let me just read two sentences from the poem that's amalizer keep
[2:40:30.600 --> 2:40:38.840]  storied lands your story pump excuse me keep storied lands your ancient pump cries she with
[2:40:38.840 --> 2:40:47.400]  silent voice give me your tired your poor your huddle masses yearning to breathe free i take
[2:40:47.400 --> 2:41:01.080]  from that when they say keep storied lands your ancient pump that basically it's the values that
[2:41:01.080 --> 2:41:17.480]  of aristocracy and so on from europe were rejected by this new american idea of freedom and liberty um
[2:41:17.800 --> 2:41:24.920]  and on the second sentence give me your tired your poor your huddle masses yearning to breathe
[2:41:24.920 --> 2:41:37.160]  free that's a requirement given lady liberties quote um if they're not yearning yearning to breathe
[2:41:37.160 --> 2:41:47.400]  free um that torch should be a hand held up stopping people that's right it's saying we're
[2:41:47.400 --> 2:41:51.480]  going to do things differently we're not going to have royalty and elites and arrogance and pump
[2:41:51.480 --> 2:41:57.480]  and garbage if you're poor and you're tired of the new world order of globalism of all this corrupt
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:42:02.120]  imperial garbage going back thousands of years if you want to come here and really build something
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:08.760]  new based on what you produce and who you really are and not the class system then come here but if
[2:42:08.760 --> 2:42:15.560]  you want to be part of the you know old system and come here and play god we don't want you here
[2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:20.040]  so now they're trying to bring here bring people here as part of globalism to be liberal haters
[2:42:20.040 --> 2:42:25.080]  who want to bring down our system as a colonizing force of the of the globalist in fact let's put
[2:42:25.080 --> 2:42:30.120]  the full poem up on screen since you mentioned it let's go to the poem and i forget who wrote the
[2:42:30.120 --> 2:42:38.680]  new colossus if you scroll down it'll say hmm let me read it while you guys find out thank you
[2:42:40.280 --> 2:42:48.360]  not like the brazen giant of greek fame that's the colossus of roads not like the brazen giant of greek
[2:42:48.360 --> 2:42:57.560]  fame with conquering limbs stride from land to land here at our washed sunset gates shall stand a
[2:42:57.560 --> 2:43:06.520]  mighty woman with a torch whose flame is the imprisoned lightning and her name mother of
[2:43:06.520 --> 2:43:16.040]  exiles from her beacon hand glows worldwide welcome her mild eyes command the air bridging
[2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:24.200]  harbour at the twin city's frame keep ancient lands your storied pomp she cries yes don't bring
[2:43:24.200 --> 2:43:31.640]  all your your global's garbage here your empire here she said with silent lips give me your tired
[2:43:31.640 --> 2:43:38.840]  your poor your huddled masses yearning to breathe free that's right the wretched refuse of your
[2:43:38.840 --> 2:43:47.000]  teeming shore send these the homeless tempest toast to me i lift my lamp beside the golden door
[2:43:47.800 --> 2:43:55.560]  but that's a nice poem off the statue that was actually meant for the nile entering into the
[2:43:55.560 --> 2:44:01.960]  Mediterranean and it's very very occultic but that's imma Lazarus famous poem the poem is a
[2:44:01.960 --> 2:44:08.440]  engraved on a tablet within the pedestal of which the statue stands uh so there you go
[2:44:09.080 --> 2:44:14.040]  but it's a good point yes if you don't want to have a new world and a new system outside of
[2:44:14.040 --> 2:44:18.040]  their globalist system and and their imperial system then don't come here that's what it's saying go
[2:44:18.040 --> 2:44:29.720]  ahead but yeah more than that it's it's a cultural thing too um when uh i'm part irish uh 20 percent
[2:44:29.720 --> 2:44:37.720]  or something uh but but i only celebrate uh my irish heritage on st baddie's day well sure i mean
[2:44:37.720 --> 2:44:40.600]  i've got probably about the same amount of irish in me the whole point is it's all just
[2:44:40.600 --> 2:44:44.600]  dramatic tribes that are in the you know whole british isles and everybody's just been talked
[2:44:44.600 --> 2:44:48.360]  to fight with each other by kings it's like brothers killing each other uh but they're still
[2:44:48.360 --> 2:44:52.120]  hatred you know i had irish fans come to hear me speak in england they were like i've never
[2:44:52.120 --> 2:44:56.440]  been better if you were here and it's just like i get it but it doesn't matter the welsh got
[2:44:56.440 --> 2:45:01.080]  conquered by the british and then it's all the same thing and but but but absolutely
[2:45:01.960 --> 2:45:06.680]  they want you to come here be in your own group which then the globalist control uh anything else
[2:45:06.680 --> 2:45:17.720]  sir uh the outgrowth of this though uh and trade uh is another issue that i just wanted to touch on
[2:45:17.720 --> 2:45:29.160]  on and that is um uh we're losing not only uh jobs but skills when we export manufacturing
[2:45:30.120 --> 2:45:39.080]  uh and when we import a talent from uh china uh the h1b visa program for example
[2:45:39.080 --> 2:45:51.800]  um takes a skill job from an american source absolutely they're saying you know bring people
[2:45:51.800 --> 2:45:55.160]  in that are entry-level workers but back then you're going to be put to work and then be trained
[2:45:55.160 --> 2:45:59.400]  i appreciate your call great points and it's the same deal today we are flooded more than
[2:45:59.400 --> 2:46:03.080]  anybody with immigrants and then they try to turn them against us once they get here most of them
[2:46:03.080 --> 2:46:07.400]  aren't like that the problem is is that you got seven plus billion people that want to come here
[2:46:07.400 --> 2:46:11.960]  and if you bring a fraction of that our wages are driven down until you stabilize wages in
[2:46:11.960 --> 2:46:18.680]  the third world you cannot have prosperity here by bringing people in great points i love the
[2:46:18.680 --> 2:46:23.240]  different angles again callers take us in bob in washington you're on the air on the same subject
[2:46:23.240 --> 2:46:32.680]  basically hello yes go ahead yeah no i just uh i'm in washington state and uh the governor
[2:46:32.680 --> 2:46:38.360]  just apparently made us be a sanctuary state irregardless of what trump said
[2:46:38.920 --> 2:46:45.960]  and i'm from a little town uh about two hours north of seattle called bellingham and the city
[2:46:45.960 --> 2:46:52.520]  council last monday uh they all unanimously decided that bellingham was going to be a sanctuary
[2:46:52.520 --> 2:46:56.760]  sure well here's the problem i mean here's the deal the feds are involved in hundreds of things
[2:46:56.760 --> 2:47:02.200]  are not supposed to be involved in under the constitution but illegals running around is one
[2:47:02.200 --> 2:47:05.880]  trump's only saying if you've been here two weeks and we catch you then we're going to send you back
[2:47:05.880 --> 2:47:10.600]  or if you're a felon or a criminal deportations are actually down because they're doing targeted
[2:47:10.600 --> 2:47:15.320]  stuff they intend to ramp that up we have to do that every other country that has a nation does it
[2:47:15.320 --> 2:47:20.040]  you're a failed state if you don't control who's in and out of the country so all they're doing
[2:47:20.040 --> 2:47:24.920]  is maintaining life support level control and they're acting like it's the end of the world kind
[2:47:24.920 --> 2:47:29.400]  of like lindbeck saying how dare he say we're a nation that's that's that you know that's dirty
[2:47:29.400 --> 2:47:38.120]  they're trying to make normal activity look evil yep like my uh my aunt went to the city
[2:47:38.120 --> 2:47:44.440]  council meeting and she wanted to she signed up to speak but when it was her turn to speak
[2:47:44.440 --> 2:47:48.440]  there was a bunch of illegals in there and they were just calling her a racist and a bigot and
[2:47:48.440 --> 2:47:51.800]  she never even got to speak oh that's the one thing about the leftists and all the rest of
[2:47:51.800 --> 2:47:56.120]  there really entitled their godlike and you don't have speech you're not going to get yours they're
[2:47:56.120 --> 2:47:59.880]  going to shout you down or they're going to you know start chanting hail lucifer hail satan
[2:47:59.880 --> 2:48:03.320]  that happened all over the country last week we have a special report coming up the start of
[2:48:03.320 --> 2:48:09.320]  the next hour that goes over all that it's crazy she was just trying to make a point that if the
[2:48:09.320 --> 2:48:15.000]  legals are paying taxes then obviously they stole somebody's identity and social security number
[2:48:15.000 --> 2:48:20.360]  because how are they able to pay taxes look look look it's it's systematic with whatever middle
[2:48:20.360 --> 2:48:23.880]  class is left to bring in an outside group and play them off against each other they're just pawns
[2:48:23.880 --> 2:48:28.840]  as well it's totally cold blooded it's very seditious and what trump's doing is is the bare
[2:48:28.840 --> 2:48:33.960]  minimum and i think because of political correctness he's not doing more we just have to have people
[2:48:33.960 --> 2:48:38.600]  here legally and we have to you know make sure they're not indoctrinated we should probably stop
[2:48:38.600 --> 2:48:44.600]  all immigration until globalist indoctrination at the school's ends because they teach these people
[2:48:44.600 --> 2:48:49.880]  you're here have a chip on your shoulder white people of the devil hate them american flags
[2:48:49.880 --> 2:48:55.720]  can't be seen in california in the schools the night circuit ruled they're racist bs it's got

[2:55:53.400 --> 2:56:00.440]  fraud right and i you know a point i want to make is you know trump is doing a great job you know
[2:56:00.440 --> 2:56:06.120]  with what he's given you know obama tried to you know singlehandedly destroy this country and he
[2:56:06.120 --> 2:56:11.560]  pretty much did you know he divided it you know through racial you know wars and you know all
[2:56:11.560 --> 2:56:16.040]  these other things you know the Benghazi stuff i mean there's a list there's a list of things i mean

[2:57:12.760 --> 2:57:17.640]  bringing in the system to end humanity as we know it this is preservation of everything
[2:57:17.640 --> 2:57:21.560]  it's like i knew if somebody was coming to kill my neighbor at midnight i'd call the cops
[2:57:21.560 --> 2:57:25.240]  and the cops didn't do anything i'd be waiting there in the dark with a rifle that's just normal

[2:57:30.200 --> 2:57:38.120]  hey alex hey thank you um every federal um building state building and court building
[2:57:38.120 --> 2:57:45.000]  has an admiralty flag with the rope around it that's a un wartime flag and the courts follow
[2:57:45.000 --> 2:57:50.440]  the constitution of the corporation of the united states and the attorneys take a pledge
[2:57:51.000 --> 2:57:57.720]  to the corporation of the united states why are we not out of the un yet well trump has legislation
[2:57:57.720 --> 2:58:02.280]  entered to do that and is moving forward uh saying that he's pulling us out of the whole thing right
[2:58:02.280 --> 2:58:11.320]  now there's also um but ma'am that's why the power structure is against trump right but there's a
[2:58:11.320 --> 2:58:18.040]  thing also about how to beat criminal charges in an admiralty court because they're not following
[2:58:18.600 --> 2:58:23.880]  our constitution sure sure that's a very complex issue there's a lot of people that do stuff pros
[2:58:23.880 --> 2:58:28.840]  say that actually make stuff up but there is kernels of truth what you know what folks are saying
[2:58:28.840 --> 2:58:33.720]  out there and so there is kind of an admiralty administrative law that's replacing the code
[2:58:33.720 --> 2:58:38.840]  and so what you say is is on target thank you so much we'll be right back with a special report

[3:00:43.800 --> 3:00:50.520]  here too please remember this broadcast is under attack all over msm they just ban us from google
[3:00:50.520 --> 3:00:54.280]  ads via ad roll they're doing that to other outfits just a lot of pressure on the free
[3:00:54.280 --> 3:01:00.440]  independent press you'll remember joe rogan they didn't for a day or so put his podcast with me up
[3:01:00.440 --> 3:01:05.560]  on itunes and it turned out to be the most popular ever and he saw other weird stuff like that go on
[3:01:05.560 --> 3:01:11.480]  so there's massive manipulation and censorship intensifying google facebook twitter all admit
[3:01:11.480 --> 3:01:17.320]  this the answer to this is a respond to it and say no don't do that that's why i appreciate joe
[3:01:17.320 --> 3:01:21.560]  rogan so much because he's got one of the biggest podcasts long form it's the longest there's some
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:26.520]  that have more subscribers there and more viewers are like you know 10 minutes long his is two and
[3:01:26.520 --> 3:01:31.000]  a half three hours long on average i did almost four hours living about a month ago and while i was
[3:01:31.000 --> 3:01:35.000]  there i talked to one of my old friends afterwards at dinner joe was doing a show and he kind of
[3:01:35.000 --> 3:01:38.360]  reiterated you know that oh i think joe got off conspiracies and stuff because he and his family
[3:01:38.360 --> 3:01:41.960]  got threatened you know the way he just got off of him but you know joe because i was saying joe
[3:01:41.960 --> 3:01:46.520]  knows more about all this stuff than i do he was finishing my sentences he remembers stuff i didn't
[3:01:46.520 --> 3:01:49.880]  remember i mean any topic i bring up i'm not kissing joe's ass i've known joe for you know
[3:01:49.880 --> 3:01:55.320]  16 17 years i was really saying as a compliment you know that man you know joe knows more about
[3:01:55.320 --> 3:01:59.640]  this than i do he can host the show better than me i'm serious because he's really good at explaining
[3:01:59.640 --> 3:02:04.840]  and covering all the angles it that's why he's so good movies and tv and you know ufc and one of
[3:02:04.840 --> 3:02:10.280]  the top comics one of the top 10 comics in the country so i made that statement turned into
[3:02:10.280 --> 3:02:15.640]  some viral deal like joe's scared he's all this stuff so then i got a little text from both joe
[3:02:15.640 --> 3:02:20.040]  but then later when i talked about it joe called him i guess i haven't talked to him yet and said hey
[3:02:20.840 --> 3:02:25.320]  and i guess one night i was up here late and i was saying yeah you know joe and his family got
[3:02:25.320 --> 3:02:29.240]  threatened so i guess that's why joe doesn't cover as much conspiracy stuff anymore but boy
[3:02:29.240 --> 3:02:35.000]  he sure knows a lot he sure is smart and it's just not true it's not accurate um the way i heard it i
[3:02:35.000 --> 3:02:39.240]  guess late at night you know out eating dinner or whatever afterwards is i kind of got it mixed up
[3:02:39.240 --> 3:02:44.120]  it was just that the person was speculating that maybe joe got threatened uh or you know because
[3:02:44.120 --> 3:02:48.120]  joe stopped covering as many conspiracies as he used to i think just a larger deal is it just
[3:02:48.120 --> 3:02:52.360]  becomes a distraction from what he was trying to do but he had me on he has a lot of other folks on
[3:02:52.360 --> 3:02:56.280]  so there's no controversy there and that is a correction because the idea that joe's scared
[3:02:56.280 --> 3:03:01.640]  of anybody and and you know wouldn't report things because he scared his pure bull i said that in a
[3:03:01.640 --> 3:03:07.800]  larger context of other people getting threatened me getting threatened and the amount of intimidation
[3:03:07.800 --> 3:03:14.280]  and garbage that goes on that we know is happening uh so there is my correction slash retraction and
[3:03:14.280 --> 3:03:18.920]  joe's not mad at me it's not some big controversy he just said dude you ever hear something like this
[3:03:18.920 --> 3:03:24.360]  call me you know you're this you know this kind of you know what give me a call what the hell is

[3:04:55.640 --> 3:05:03.080]  trump and satanism the united states foreign policy and engagement with syria has been a disaster
[3:05:03.080 --> 3:05:07.800]  and it may start and end with john mccain four years mccain has been a buffer between the middle
[3:05:07.800 --> 3:05:13.080]  east and the united states mccain took a rare trip to syria in 2013 he met with so-called moderate
[3:05:13.080 --> 3:05:17.000]  rebels obama was bankrolling in army it turned out that these moderate rebels were the ones
[3:05:17.000 --> 3:05:21.480]  destabilizing the region and could even be tied to isis but of course this would fit the foreign
[3:05:21.480 --> 3:05:26.120]  policy of the obama administration and the clinton state department which wanted bashar asad removed
[3:05:26.120 --> 3:05:31.400]  from power last week mccain took another rare and secret trip to syria a spokesperson for mccain
[3:05:31.400 --> 3:05:37.000]  said he was there to visit with us ground forces to discuss plans to defeat isle isle not isis they
[3:05:37.000 --> 3:05:42.760]  were sure to clarify now how coincidental upon mccain's return to the us news stories everywhere
[3:05:42.760 --> 3:05:47.400]  are talking about more us ground forces being sent to syria john mccain is a detriment to our
[3:05:47.400 --> 3:05:52.280]  nation the middle east and peace on this planet he needs to be removed from any unelected duties

[3:08:38.600 --> 3:08:43.640]  and down with donald trump and it gets worse they're now announcing on national television
[3:08:43.640 --> 3:08:51.400]  that the public should join hands in ritual magic against donald trump to bring him down
[3:08:51.400 --> 3:09:14.920]  i don't want to ever hear again from the corporate mainstream media that
[3:09:14.920 --> 3:09:20.440]  there's no occult connections to the left or that you know there's no bizarre rituals
[3:09:20.440 --> 3:09:26.280]  taking place when it's all over tv all over hollywood all over rock and roll all over hip hop
[3:09:26.280 --> 3:09:34.040]  all over the news calling for everyone to focus psychically with satan or lucifer to kill trump
[3:09:34.040 --> 3:09:39.400]  tonight and then you go to town halls of the texas capital and people are saying hail lucifer
[3:09:39.400 --> 3:09:45.960]  hail satan and they've just adopted this satanic culture whether you believe there's a real devil
[3:09:45.960 --> 3:09:53.800]  or not these people fundamentally hate progress and success because they're a bunch of arrested
[3:09:53.800 --> 3:10:00.360]  development losers that have been taught it's cool to not excel and to be a loser and they wouldn't
[3:10:00.360 --> 3:10:06.440]  last five minutes in sadan or samalia without being killed or kidnapped or raped and they're
[3:10:06.440 --> 3:10:12.680]  just like bring this in as fast as you can because they're one with the radical islamic spirit of
[3:10:12.680 --> 3:10:18.360]  wahhabism that if you look at it is satanic having little kids kill people cutting people's
[3:10:18.360 --> 3:10:23.480]  throats having prisoners you're about to kill eat human flesh so you send them to hell according
[3:10:23.480 --> 3:10:29.720]  to the quran this is all admitted and again they're praising satan they're praising lucifer
[3:10:29.720 --> 3:10:33.720]  they're calling for the death of trump they're outraged the mainstream media that trump is
[3:10:33.720 --> 3:10:40.440]  invoking the birthright of god and calling god back into our world to have some truly you know
[3:10:40.440 --> 3:10:45.160]  positive outlooks whether you believe in god or not if you had some beautiful you know
[3:10:46.440 --> 3:10:51.080]  tree in your house and you you worshiped life and wanted to build something good
[3:10:51.080 --> 3:10:55.800]  and be a wholesome person you could say that was positive outlook but if you're worshiping
[3:10:55.800 --> 3:11:02.200]  the devil that's about greed and dysfunction and destruction and willful rebellion against our
[3:11:02.200 --> 3:11:07.800]  natural order that's so fulfilling and so good and attacking men and women and the family and the
[3:11:07.800 --> 3:11:13.960]  holy union of the man and woman and trying to ban those terms and national geographic not having a
[3:11:13.960 --> 3:11:21.880]  single normal normal yes classic mammal female on the cover shows you it's a true attack on the
[3:11:21.880 --> 3:11:27.000]  fortress of our strength women that's why they claim they love women because they want to keep
[3:11:27.000 --> 3:11:35.160]  their enemies closer they want to destroy the archetype of the goddess these are truly satanic
[3:11:35.160 --> 3:11:54.520]  people so at the c-pack speech and it is inauguration a month and a half ago president trump says
[3:11:54.520 --> 3:11:59.720]  hey it's okay to say jesus christ it's okay to say that you know god has been part of the thawning
[3:11:59.720 --> 3:12:05.640]  of this nation it's okay to ask god for providence it's okay to want to be positive and productive
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:11.160]  and optimistic and by the way america has been captured in hijacked by globalist interests
[3:12:11.160 --> 3:12:16.520]  that have set up deals to conquer us financially and politically while transferring our power
[3:12:16.520 --> 3:12:24.520]  to third world dictatorships they control to then exploit those populations and they howl and they
[3:12:24.520 --> 3:12:30.840]  scream with hate and say you're anti gay you're anti this you're anti that when none of it's even true
[3:12:32.200 --> 3:12:38.280]  because the truth is trump is inclusive the globalist and their minions just want to get
[3:12:38.280 --> 3:12:42.360]  rid of our sovereignty and say we don't have a right to have a country so that's why they're
[3:12:42.360 --> 3:12:48.440]  attacking trump because they want to create borderless systems with a bunch of dispossessed
[3:12:48.440 --> 3:12:55.880]  alone disenfranchised dumbed down people like a modern tower of babel fighting with each other
[3:12:55.880 --> 3:13:03.800]  when you open your heart to patriotism there is no room for prejudice the bible tells us
[3:13:04.440 --> 3:13:12.920]  how good and pleasant it is when god's people live together in unity we must speak our minds
[3:13:12.920 --> 3:13:23.080]  openly debate our disagreements honestly but always pursue solidarity when america is united
[3:13:23.800 --> 3:13:29.400]  america is totally unstoppable so let's go over some of these headlines that are at info
[3:13:29.400 --> 3:13:35.800]  wars dot com right now links to mainstream news witches around the world plot mass spell against
[3:13:35.800 --> 3:13:41.160]  trump and the news is reporting it like it's completely normal tonight by the light of the
[3:13:41.160 --> 3:13:48.440]  waning moon witches will cast a binding spell on donald trump it's like a ghost dance but the
[3:13:48.440 --> 3:13:52.600]  native americans were very very pure with their ghost dance not knowing why their world was collapsing
[3:13:52.600 --> 3:13:57.400]  so they just went and said join with our ancestors send us back in time we don't know what to do
[3:13:58.040 --> 3:14:06.200]  that was a loving ritual from the research i've done surprised god didn't really hear that call
[3:14:06.200 --> 3:14:13.160]  because some bad things were done to those people you are calling for black magic and donald trump's
[3:14:13.160 --> 3:14:21.960]  death and i was reading here for the demons of the abyss to come out of hell and destroy trump
[3:14:21.960 --> 3:14:27.720]  here's another one lana del ray joins ever to defeat trump with witchcraft rolling stone
[3:14:29.000 --> 3:14:33.880]  witchcraft to hex trumps populist battle cry that's the video we broke down and you got the
[3:14:33.880 --> 3:14:38.200]  pope saying he's disgusted it makes him sick in his stomach when he hears about europe having
[3:14:38.200 --> 3:14:43.880]  christian roots it can't even have christian roots now truly a satanic pope as well to be a cherry
[3:14:43.880 --> 3:14:49.880]  on top to this little event we're witnessing but this isn't just viral post on facebook
[3:14:49.880 --> 3:14:55.320]  pushed by hollywood stars and music stars uh that you know got picked up this is happening at the
[3:14:55.320 --> 3:15:01.000]  town halls all over the country that the controlled corporate fake stream media is pushing people to
[3:15:01.000 --> 3:15:08.280]  go out to and at these if the towns dare have an opening prayer protesters freak out yell lucifer
[3:15:08.840 --> 3:15:13.000]  after g.o.p town hall opens with a prayer and you watch the video it's like something out of the
[3:15:13.000 --> 3:15:18.760]  bible where they're like no not prayer oh lucifer i mean this is like i think i turn into frogs or
[3:15:18.760 --> 3:15:40.200]  something this is crazy and then of course you have what's happened in texas where they're
[3:15:40.200 --> 3:15:45.800]  having a pro-life event trying to pass a ban on partial birth abortions and people show up
[3:15:45.800 --> 3:15:51.960]  and start saying hail satan hail satan you say oh well they're just trying to be you know shocking
[3:15:51.960 --> 3:15:56.920]  no this is the spirit they're into i know people that are in the pro-abortion movement it isn't
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:16:01.480]  like they had an abortion it was a mistake or you know whatever you're forgiven whatever we're not
[3:16:01.480 --> 3:16:04.440]  telling people that have had abortions it's the fact that women that are really into it like
[3:16:04.440 --> 3:16:16.680]  oria steinham say it's a ritual they're proud of it how many did i adopt i kill my kids i kill my kids
[3:16:16.680 --> 3:16:23.800]  i pay all my money for that i get free abortions on demand without apology you know and i'm going
[3:16:23.800 --> 3:16:31.800]  to hell yeah i still pay to kill babies though really oh yeah this is the definition of modern
[3:16:31.800 --> 3:16:38.520]  liberal pop satanism that we see all over the culture a bunch of self-centered people that say
[3:16:39.480 --> 3:16:42.440]  i'll go in your girl's bathroom when i'm a six foot four man
[3:16:44.680 --> 3:16:50.520]  we'll let three men identifying as women come over and assault and get in the face of our
[3:16:50.520 --> 3:16:56.440]  reporter at a public march at a public event and bully her till she deletes the footage off
[3:16:56.440 --> 3:17:02.280]  her tape has happened last night to millie weaver we'll do whatever we want because we'll do as we
[3:17:02.280 --> 3:17:07.160]  will do as thou wills the whole of all alistair crowley and we're going to dominate you and we're
[3:17:07.160 --> 3:17:14.280]  going to control you and what it really is is a bunch of spoiled toddlers throwing giant fits
[3:17:15.320 --> 3:17:21.480]  going after everyone and trying to bully them in a gang mentality so it's basically hordes of betas
[3:17:21.480 --> 3:17:29.400]  who are now deciding in huge swarms to become alphas but a real alpha would try to build
[3:17:29.400 --> 3:17:34.360]  people up and be honorable and strong instead they want to destroy in the video i'm talking about
[3:17:35.240 --> 3:17:42.440]  there's one large man probably six three i just know how tall millie is wearing a wig identifying
[3:17:42.440 --> 3:17:47.000]  as a woman fine i don't care coming over and kind of get in her face and millie's so charming he says
[3:17:47.000 --> 3:17:53.080]  fine marry me and that guy's funny and i don't care if he's out there wearing a wig dancing around
[3:17:53.080 --> 3:17:59.320]  having fun fine i'm not judging him but they wouldn't even come give her intellectual arguments they
[3:17:59.320 --> 3:18:06.280]  just cussed and yelled and screamed at her and only one person actually came over to her and was
[3:18:06.280 --> 3:18:12.600]  somewhat funny and made a joke out of it because she was being nice and they're screaming how donald
[3:18:12.600 --> 3:18:17.080]  trump's had to get gay people when he's been an advocate for equal rights for 30 years before it
[3:18:17.080 --> 3:18:22.760]  was cool but they don't care it's not about that it's about just like christians can become very
[3:18:22.760 --> 3:18:27.720]  very orthodox and very very oppressive and have been in history and kind of gangs controlling
[3:18:27.720 --> 3:18:32.840]  behavior being kind of puritanical as a system of control the left claimed they were all about
[3:18:32.840 --> 3:18:39.480]  open societies but was captured by the children and grandchildren of people that were uptight
[3:18:39.480 --> 3:18:45.640]  anal retentive people before that's why they're not punk rock they're not avant garde they're not
[3:18:45.640 --> 3:18:50.040]  cutting edge they're not counterculture they're the opposite and that's why the left is wedding
[3:18:50.040 --> 3:18:55.800]  itself to the most radical orthodox forms of oppressive islam that rapes women en masse in
[3:18:55.800 --> 3:19:00.680]  sweden and germany and the netherlands and their government admittedly is ordered to cover it up
[3:19:00.680 --> 3:19:06.760]  and as mobs of men rape women in big crowds of people nothing is done because the religion
[3:19:06.760 --> 3:19:13.160]  is you must submit you must give over your culture you must be passive if you're an alpha
[3:19:13.880 --> 3:19:22.040]  to the giant mass of betas who are coming to rape and enslave you finally in closing study history
[3:19:22.040 --> 3:19:29.560]  and the facts for yourself it's unequivocal no country no nation no culture can survive
[3:19:30.360 --> 3:19:35.800]  when it involves itself in black magic the dark arts even if you don't believe the christian
[3:19:35.800 --> 3:19:43.320]  cosmology asia and their histories understand this as well when you tune into the dark side it'll give
[3:19:43.320 --> 3:19:50.760]  you limited quick power up front but we'll destroy you and everyone around you in the process and as
[3:19:50.760 --> 3:19:59.160]  a culture in massive decline the so-called leftist or the left hand path the sinister hand is openly
[3:19:59.160 --> 3:20:06.200]  invoking satanism and luciferianism in america just as they did during the french revolution that
[3:20:06.200 --> 3:20:13.560]  killed close to a million people the reason our enemies are so crazed is they understand
[3:20:13.560 --> 3:20:22.280]  they're dialed into something very dark very old very twisted and only powerful against those
[3:20:22.280 --> 3:20:42.360]  that don't know what they're facing all right welcome back to the alex jones showing this
[3:20:42.360 --> 3:20:49.240]  monday february 27 2017 i'm david night as you heard the melting mascot of the globalist crying
[3:20:49.240 --> 3:20:55.000]  out there with the with the water dump tunnel look folks uh we're winning and one of the signs
[3:20:55.000 --> 3:21:00.760]  that we're winning is something that just happened in new hampshire we just had new hampshire gun
[3:21:00.760 --> 3:21:07.080]  owners have the governor there sign a bill for constitutional carry and this is what i've said
[3:21:07.080 --> 3:21:13.480]  before with donald trump we need somebody at the national level to fight off the globalists
[3:21:13.480 --> 3:21:19.960]  but we have to take responsibility at the local level to get back our freedoms and that's exactly
[3:21:19.960 --> 3:21:23.480]  what they've done done here in new hampshire you haven't heard about this this happened
[3:21:23.480 --> 3:21:28.200]  nearly a week ago it was last wednesday we had the republican governor there chris sonunu
[3:21:29.160 --> 3:21:35.080]  he'd be the son i guess of john sonunu signed into a law that says this quote it allows a person
[3:21:35.080 --> 3:21:42.280]  to carry a loaded concealed pistol or revolver without a license it's not a privilege it's a right
[3:21:42.280 --> 3:21:47.560]  folks unless such person is otherwise prohibited by the new hampshire statutes okay so in other
[3:21:47.560 --> 3:21:54.680]  words you have a right to protect yourself and you only get that right removed when you do something
[3:21:54.680 --> 3:21:59.560]  criminal just like you have a right to move about freely and they put you in prison if they convict
[3:21:59.560 --> 3:22:03.880]  you of something in a day of court they can take away your gun rights as well if you do something
[3:22:03.880 --> 3:22:09.800]  that is criminal but you should not be judged to be irresponsible which is what gun control
[3:22:09.800 --> 3:22:14.760]  does in the first place to say that we're going to treat this as a privilege and we'll grant it to
[3:22:14.760 --> 3:22:19.880]  you as if you were children and we're not going to presume that you're innocent and worthy of
[3:22:19.880 --> 3:22:24.440]  self-defense and they point out this bill ensures new hampshire citizens are guaranteed to the
[3:22:24.440 --> 3:22:29.560]  fundamental right to carry a firearm in defense of themselves and their families as prescribed
[3:22:29.560 --> 3:22:35.640]  by article 2a of our state constitution that's what the governor said and of course his democrat
[3:22:35.640 --> 3:22:41.480]  predecessor had vetoed the bill this is an article from mrc tv they say this makes new hampshire the
[3:22:41.480 --> 3:22:48.040]  12th state that doesn't generally require a license or a permit to carry a concealed weapon
[3:22:48.680 --> 3:22:53.960]  so this is how it happens we have to have somebody fighting off the globalist making sure that we
[3:22:53.960 --> 3:22:59.800]  still have a country that we still have a constitution but they don't pay attention to the constitution
[3:22:59.800 --> 3:23:03.960]  whether it's the state constitution or the federal constitution we are going to have to work at the
[3:23:03.960 --> 3:23:08.600]  local level this is a good example of how that is done meanwhile while you've got the people in
[3:23:08.600 --> 3:23:13.560]  new hampshire and that's not an area even though they have a lot of freedom in terms of carrying
[3:23:13.560 --> 3:23:19.320]  guns a lot of other freedoms you don't see them burning the place down in the streets like we just
[3:23:19.320 --> 3:23:24.360]  saw in switzerland switzerland used to be that kind of place didn't it but what's happening there we've
[3:23:24.360 --> 3:23:29.960]  got the leftist we've got the refugees coming in and now you see violence erupting in the streets
[3:23:29.960 --> 3:23:35.240]  of switzerland burn switzerland no less this is from rt they say several hundred people
[3:23:35.240 --> 3:23:39.960]  gathered in an unauthorized protest and burn over the weekend this descended into violence
[3:23:39.960 --> 3:23:45.800]  as hooded youth set cars on fire police used tear gas they deployed water cannons to disperse the
[3:23:45.800 --> 3:23:51.480]  crowd and the president of the police union there and burn said this is a war on the police
[3:23:52.120 --> 3:23:57.080]  do you understand this is the same tactic that george soros and black lives matters has been
[3:23:57.080 --> 3:24:03.560]  setting up here in america this is a global movement and it is a movement by the leftists
[3:24:03.560 --> 3:24:10.760]  they use surrogates to do this and they also have planned this the police union president said this
[3:24:10.760 --> 3:24:16.440]  is tragic i doubt demonstrators are worried about politics they wage war against the police this is
[3:24:16.440 --> 3:24:23.240]  new for burn yes it is this is the new globalist plan they have the same plan for all of us part
[3:24:23.240 --> 3:24:28.280]  of that plan is opening up the borders bringing in people who don't want to assimilate bringing them
[3:24:28.280 --> 3:24:33.720]  in and large enough numbers that you guarantee that they won't have to assimilate creating leftists
[3:24:33.720 --> 3:24:38.920]  who are going to plan and burn the city down and attack the police and so the worrying thing here
[3:24:38.920 --> 3:24:44.440]  is that violence seen throughout the weekend was planned they say punishment for protesters engaging
[3:24:44.440 --> 3:24:50.040]  in attacks against the police should be toughened he concluded and of course when we see this talked
[3:24:50.040 --> 3:24:53.560]  about in the united states it's not just against the police but it's also against other people
[3:24:54.280 --> 3:24:57.640]  and when they get into the streets when they blockade the streets when they attack
[3:24:57.640 --> 3:25:04.360]  people's homes their businesses their automobiles when they create a safety issue by blocking the
[3:25:04.360 --> 3:25:11.320]  street that is not protest that is not a speech that is simply a violent riot we have to call it
[3:25:11.320 --> 3:25:16.280]  that and yet it's interesting because last week as i pointed out on friday there was an article
[3:25:16.280 --> 3:25:22.760]  from the hill and the headline on the article was that there were numerous bills being proposed
[3:25:22.760 --> 3:25:27.320]  throughout the united states that would shut down free speech and then they talked about the people
[3:25:27.320 --> 3:25:32.600]  who were blockading roads and so forth and i've been talking about this for i guess it's been
[3:25:32.600 --> 3:25:38.760]  about six weeks ago i put up a poll on my twitter account liberty terrian and we put that we had
[3:25:38.760 --> 3:25:44.120]  about 11 000 people take that poll about 10 percent of people thought that it was a free speech issue
[3:25:44.120 --> 3:25:49.320]  to block the streets and to get violent with people but the other 90 percent understood what
[3:25:49.320 --> 3:25:55.720]  that was about uh this is not this is not about free speech we have to understand what free
[3:25:55.720 --> 3:26:00.040]  speech is and what it isn't we're going to talk about here in just a moment george w bush
[3:26:00.840 --> 3:26:06.120]  shrub has come out of retirement to criticize donald trump and one of the things that he does
[3:26:06.120 --> 3:26:12.680]  is twist the meaning of free speech so we need to understand what free speech is and what it isn't
[3:26:12.680 --> 3:26:18.840]  it doesn't give you a right to riot it is not a right to riot it is not a right to set fire to
[3:26:18.840 --> 3:26:23.320]  the theater you don't even have a right to yell fire in a crowded theater when there is no fire
[3:26:23.320 --> 3:26:29.240]  you certainly don't have a right to set fire to the theater and even in that article the headline
[3:26:29.240 --> 3:26:36.120]  that says republicans across the country are working to create laws against free speech and
[3:26:36.120 --> 3:26:40.120]  then if you read the first paragraph what does it say it says well the rioters blah blah blah
[3:26:40.120 --> 3:26:45.560]  they understand themselves that it's a riot and we have shown darin mcbrane did a great piece he said
[3:26:45.560 --> 3:26:52.200]  this is a protest this is uh somebody talking about issues holding up signs arguing people
[3:26:52.200 --> 3:26:57.480]  this is a protest this over here is a riot folks when they start throwing stuff at people when
[3:26:57.480 --> 3:27:02.520]  they start smashing windows smashing cars setting fires when they start getting in your face your
[3:27:02.520 --> 3:27:07.640]  freedom ends at the edge of my noshing swinging your fist all you want to as they say but when
[3:27:07.640 --> 3:27:13.880]  you start hitting me it's no longer free speeches than a riot and we have to understand that is a
[3:27:13.880 --> 3:27:18.760]  key difference but also look at the fact that here in switzerland we've got the same thing
[3:27:18.760 --> 3:27:23.080]  happening that we have here interestingly enough we've got a swedish billionaire you know the place
[3:27:23.080 --> 3:27:28.280]  where they want to pretend they don't have any of these problems with the mass migration that they
[3:27:28.280 --> 3:27:33.320]  brought into sweden the people replacement that is going on there and now we have a swedish billionaire
[3:27:33.320 --> 3:27:39.640]  interestingly enough this guy comes from hungry just like george soros he fled hungry he started
[3:27:39.640 --> 3:27:44.760]  playing the financial markets became a multi multi billionaire and now he's pushing globalism
[3:27:44.760 --> 3:27:50.840]  well that rhymes too doesn't it we keep seeing the same template everywhere these riots these
[3:27:50.840 --> 3:27:56.840]  hungarian uh billionaires who played the stock market now here's one from sweden he's going to
[3:27:56.840 --> 3:28:03.160]  award five million dollars to people so they can reimagine global governance because their plans
[3:28:03.160 --> 3:28:09.080]  are not working because we've exposed their plans we've shown you what their plans are we've told you
[3:28:09.880 --> 3:28:16.360]  just like zebigniew brzezinski created the trilateral commission and that was essentially
[3:28:17.000 --> 3:28:23.400]  manifest and the trans pacific transatlantic partnerships that was a manifestation of what
[3:28:23.400 --> 3:28:29.800]  he had planned to basically create the world around three different financial centers that would
[3:28:29.800 --> 3:28:33.880]  then become political centers that would then unify into a world government and we said this is
[3:28:33.880 --> 3:28:39.880]  the direction that they're going and that plan was busted and it was now shut down by donald trump
[3:28:39.880 --> 3:28:44.600]  and we're going to see other nationalist governments coming together of course a part of it was the
[3:28:44.600 --> 3:28:49.640]  european union that is now itself unraveling so the swedish billionaire says wait this just
[3:28:49.640 --> 3:28:53.800]  isn't working we've got to come up with a better rationale for this and of course part of the
[3:28:53.800 --> 3:28:59.320]  key rationale for world government has always been climate change and that's one of the things
[3:28:59.320 --> 3:29:03.960]  that he's calling for he's saying let's figure out how we can use climate change well one of the
[3:29:03.960 --> 3:29:10.520]  good news uh pieces that came out today is as donald trump is looking at what he's going to do
[3:29:10.520 --> 3:29:14.440]  with the budget one of the things that he's going to do of course he's going to increase military
[3:29:14.440 --> 3:29:18.760]  spending i'm not necessarily on board with that i'll say that i'm not on board with it because
[3:29:18.760 --> 3:29:23.320]  i think that we need to do more with what we've got if we continue to expand the welfare warfare
[3:29:23.320 --> 3:29:29.320]  state we are not going to be able to handle this by reforming things around the edges but of course
[3:29:29.320 --> 3:29:33.320]  the first thing they need to do just like the first people that need to be taken out of this
[3:29:33.320 --> 3:29:36.520]  country that are here illegally are the gang members well you know what the gang members that
[3:29:36.520 --> 3:29:40.760]  they've got to shut down are the gang members in washington the bureaucracies and we're going to
[3:29:40.760 --> 3:29:46.200]  talk about that when we come back but of course key on the chopping block is the climate change
[3:29:46.200 --> 3:29:50.600]  agenda because that's part of the globalist agenda for world government stay with us be right
[3:29:50.600 --> 3:29:55.480]  fires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[3:29:59.480 --> 3:30:03.560]  a measuring stick for decorum in congress is approaching as president trump is set to
[3:30:03.560 --> 3:30:08.600]  deliver his first address to congress in an event classified by its dignity and demeanor the presidential
[3:30:08.600 --> 3:30:12.920]  address will certainly be shadowed by the democrat trolls who are planning on bringing guests such as
[3:30:12.920 --> 3:30:18.120]  muslim americans and dreamers in a sad attempt to tug at the heartstrings of america's electorate
[3:30:18.120 --> 3:30:22.760]  and in an attempt to cast trump as the bad guy so instead of concern for their constituents in
[3:30:22.760 --> 3:30:26.840]  the states and counties that they represent they're out casting nets in a search effort to find
[3:30:26.840 --> 3:30:31.800]  political pawns they can use against trump in the psychological battle of optics this is also an
[3:30:31.800 --> 3:30:37.160]  opportunity for trump to again sound the sirens of nationalism against globalism and america first
[3:30:37.160 --> 3:30:41.720]  policies that will bring jobs back to america info wars will have live coverage of trump's address

[3:30:51.000 --> 3:30:56.120]  be the renewal of the american spirit of course the never trump democrats would try to deter that

[3:33:20.680 --> 3:33:24.040]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host of this fourth hour
[3:33:24.840 --> 3:33:32.600]  we're gonna go back to this swedish billionaire who's going to be offering five million dollars
[3:33:32.600 --> 3:33:37.800]  for people to come up with some new way to sell global governance to us because what they're selling
[3:33:37.800 --> 3:33:42.840]  is nobody is buying and they're really circling the wagons folks they're trying to come up with
[3:33:42.840 --> 3:33:47.400]  different ways to control this and one of the things that they've been planning for some time
[3:33:47.400 --> 3:33:52.920]  and they're going through with even though they lost this election and that is to move against
[3:33:53.560 --> 3:33:58.360]  the free press and i'm not talking about cnn and the washington post they're squealing very
[3:33:58.360 --> 3:34:04.040]  loudly about the fact that they're not getting their monopoly recognized that they established
[3:34:04.600 --> 3:34:10.360]  and we're going to talk about george w bush citing with them essentially with against
[3:34:10.360 --> 3:34:15.640]  donald trump essentially flying the flag that he's always been part of he's always been part of the
[3:34:15.640 --> 3:34:19.640]  globalist but he flies a little bit more clearly right now and we're going to talk about that in
[3:34:19.640 --> 3:34:25.000]  just a moment but you can see the fact that they're altering their techniques they're doubling down
[3:34:25.000 --> 3:34:32.040]  on where they were going one of the aspects of that is to censor our ads they couldn't organize
[3:34:32.040 --> 3:34:38.440]  a sponsor boycott of us because we sell our own products and we do it on a non-political site
[3:34:38.440 --> 3:34:45.320]  that serves non-political ads that has things like silver bullet and supermail vitality and so what
[3:34:45.320 --> 3:34:49.720]  they did was they said well we're not going to allow you to put those ads out there so last
[3:34:49.720 --> 3:34:56.840]  wincy we did a 13 hour live broadcast to make sure that people understood that and at infowarstore.com
[3:34:56.840 --> 3:35:02.360]  our non-political site you will find these specials that we have now continued to extend from that
[3:35:02.920 --> 3:35:07.640]  program that 13 hour broadcast we did last wincy it was a major hit on us financially
[3:35:07.640 --> 3:35:12.120]  and we appreciate you standing with us many of you have and we hope that you will stand with us
[3:35:12.120 --> 3:35:16.120]  we stand with you in terms of products that we put out there we're capitalist we don't want to
[3:35:16.120 --> 3:35:20.680]  just ask you for donations we do appreciate people who do donate and we did have that as part of that
[3:35:21.320 --> 3:35:28.840]  broadcast but we also want to help you to protect your health and that of your family and to

[3:36:34.520 --> 3:36:42.200]  five million dollars this is a global challenges prize 2017 a new shape is what he's saying you
[3:36:42.200 --> 3:36:47.080]  know they're trying to sell us it's the same old crap that they're trying to put in a new
[3:36:47.080 --> 3:36:51.960]  box okay a new bag of crap he's calling on individuals groups of individuals universities
[3:36:51.960 --> 3:36:56.600]  companies associations from anywhere in the world to submit proposals outlining an alternative world
[3:36:56.600 --> 3:37:03.320]  government model because their model stinks like the pile crap that it is either by revising the
[3:37:03.320 --> 3:37:11.480]  president u n system or by proposing completely new forms of government and we need to focus on
[3:37:11.480 --> 3:37:16.520]  pressing growth global problems and the first one he mentions of course is climate change and other
[3:37:16.520 --> 3:37:21.080]  things like population growth see that's what we need to have the government telling us how many
[3:37:21.080 --> 3:37:26.440]  kids we can have the government funding abortions and them telling us that the world is going to
[3:37:26.440 --> 3:37:29.880]  melt down if we have a one degree change in temperature and they don't even have the data
[3:37:30.520 --> 3:37:36.120]  the baseline data to measure that against they don't have the ability to make those kind of fine
[3:37:36.120 --> 3:37:40.680]  term measurements but of course they're going to tell us that we have to do something it's a global
[3:37:40.680 --> 3:37:46.200]  problem and we have to fight it globally we have to fund that fight globally we have to therefore
[3:37:46.200 --> 3:37:53.560]  have a global government to do that see how that works you create an imaginary problem then you
[3:37:53.560 --> 3:37:57.880]  create the global solution to that imaginary problem so now he's offering people money because
[3:37:57.880 --> 3:38:03.720]  they just aren't getting there meanwhile we see Marine Le Pen surging in the polls 27% of voters
[3:38:04.600 --> 3:38:11.000]  say they're backing her and then we have her closest rival at 25% most of this is even their
[3:38:11.000 --> 3:38:15.320]  polls the same people who in France said oh look we're going to have the Russians hacking our
[3:38:15.320 --> 3:38:21.080]  election all the stuff is the same don't you see this how they've got the same lefty progressive
[3:38:21.080 --> 3:38:26.920]  leftist rioting in Sweden I'm sorry Switzerland now just as you've got a Swedish billionaire trying
[3:38:26.920 --> 3:38:32.360]  to tell us that we have to have world governance a Swedish billionaire from Hungary who made his
[3:38:32.360 --> 3:38:36.840]  money in the stock market I mean it just doesn't change it's the same people over and over again
[3:38:36.840 --> 3:38:44.120]  with the same types of strategies and they point out the polls have shown that Le Pen is likely to
[3:38:44.120 --> 3:38:47.320]  win in the first round but lose in the second well we'll see about that these are the same people
[3:38:47.320 --> 3:38:52.280]  that told us Donald Trump could not possibly win I think they're going to have a surprise coming
[3:38:52.280 --> 3:38:58.600]  because she is right at the center of the zeitgeist she understands what's going on let's talk about
[3:38:59.160 --> 3:39:07.800]  bush 43 George W. Bush or as I like to call him shrub shrub came out and attacked Trump's travel
[3:39:07.800 --> 3:39:15.480]  ban he was interviewed on NBC of course used to be this tradition that the presidents went quietly
[3:39:15.480 --> 3:39:19.880]  into retirement they didn't really talk about much and they didn't criticize the incumbent they
[3:39:19.880 --> 3:39:24.360]  did everything they could to avoid that but that's not what's happening anymore because these people
[3:39:24.360 --> 3:39:28.440]  are really desperate just like the Swedish billionaires can offer millions of people from
[3:39:28.440 --> 3:39:35.160]  people to come up with a new way to sell this we've now got shrub as well as Obama out there
[3:39:35.160 --> 3:39:39.320]  openly opposing Donald Trump because he's not part of their globalist establishment
[3:39:40.280 --> 3:39:47.400]  you know I just have to say to shrub no we don't miss you yet and I don't think we're going to
[3:39:47.400 --> 3:39:54.760]  miss you when you fly your flag to show us even more clearly where you where your loyalties lie
[3:39:54.760 --> 3:40:01.800]  as we see in this NBC this is on Monday today's show shrub comes out and says they asked him
[3:40:01.800 --> 3:40:08.120]  about Trump's executive order halting immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries and
[3:40:08.120 --> 3:40:13.800]  what does he say he said well the bedrock of our freedom is the right to worship freely
[3:40:14.760 --> 3:40:21.160]  think about that for a moment what he's doing here is he shifts this a very clever pivot you
[3:40:21.160 --> 3:40:27.720]  may say that George is not very smart but somebody told him what to say or he figured out himself
[3:40:27.720 --> 3:40:34.200]  because this is a very sly pivot that he does here what he does is he says uh when they talk
[3:40:34.200 --> 3:40:40.440]  about Muslims coming here what he is putting forth to you is a right of immigration but he
[3:40:40.440 --> 3:40:47.960]  sells it to you as our first amendment right to the freedom of free exercise of religion
[3:40:47.960 --> 3:40:53.400]  you understand that's how he's putting it out here he says to Matt Lauer he says well we have
[3:40:53.400 --> 3:40:58.200]  a right to worship freely he says I think it's very important for us all to recognize one of our
[3:40:58.200 --> 3:41:02.200]  great strengths is for people to be able to worship the way they want to or not worship at
[3:41:02.200 --> 3:41:06.520]  all the bedrock of our freedom and a bedrock of our freedom is the right to worship freely he says
[3:41:06.520 --> 3:41:11.800]  this in response to a question about people coming here from Muslim countries and so
[3:41:12.600 --> 3:41:19.720]  Dubya is telling us that Trump's ban on people coming from a predominantly Muslim country
[3:41:19.720 --> 3:41:24.760]  that we are currently at war with that we're bombing these are people that Barack Obama
[3:41:24.760 --> 3:41:30.680]  bombed and yet we're supposed to let them in here without any vetting and George Dubya Bush tells us
[3:41:30.680 --> 3:41:37.320]  well we have a right to worship freely so we should let these people come in see he makes it
[3:41:37.320 --> 3:41:42.840]  about religion very carefully and he pivots it into that he twists that is a very very clever
[3:41:42.840 --> 3:41:48.520]  very devious twist that he's got there he says I'm all for an immigration policy that is welcoming
[3:41:48.520 --> 3:41:54.520]  and upholds the law oh so then I guess he would not be in favor of foreign citizens who are here
[3:41:54.520 --> 3:41:59.560]  illegally who thumb their nose at the law oh no no he would be all for that actually and actually
[3:41:59.560 --> 3:42:03.960]  what he would like to do is with people like Paul Ryan he would like to make that perfectly legal
[3:42:04.920 --> 3:42:10.840]  perfectly legal you know I talked about it on friday briefly the fact that we have uh I think
[3:42:10.840 --> 3:42:16.360]  it was the uh the amount was one or two billion dollars I don't have the article here on my desk
[3:42:16.360 --> 3:42:22.040]  one or two billion dollars that they found going to people out of the social security program as
[3:42:22.040 --> 3:42:27.400]  welfare payments not as retirement payments but as welfare payments and the majority of that was
[3:42:27.400 --> 3:42:34.040]  going to people who didn't even have social security numbers because we we have taken the position
[3:42:34.040 --> 3:42:39.800]  that you don't have to be a citizen to come here you can come here illegally if you're a child you
[3:42:39.800 --> 3:42:46.760]  can come here and then your parents can come in after you so you don't even you can be an anchor baby
[3:42:46.760 --> 3:42:51.640]  if you're part of the DACA program you don't even have to be born here in the united states you can
[3:42:51.640 --> 3:42:57.000]  just come here as a minor and now you're an anchor baby see how they've expanded that first they came
[3:42:57.000 --> 3:43:01.240]  up with they invented the right of becoming a citizen even though your parents were not
[3:43:01.800 --> 3:43:06.360]  americans you could come here and if you're born on american soil they said well you're going to be
[3:43:06.360 --> 3:43:10.600]  automatically an anchor baby no we need to push back against that that's not what the constitution
[3:43:10.600 --> 3:43:15.480]  is about at all it's not about that I don't know any other country that does that maybe some other
[3:43:15.480 --> 3:43:20.440]  countries do but it's not right but now they've extended it to the to the point where if you come
[3:43:20.440 --> 3:43:26.840]  here under a certain age then we're going to afford you all the benefits of the welfare state and
[3:43:26.840 --> 3:43:31.160]  you can bring in your extended family and they can enjoy the benefits of the extended welfare
[3:43:31.160 --> 3:43:35.640]  state as well and they look at people who say well hey it's only a couple of billion dollars
[3:43:35.640 --> 3:43:41.160]  and we can't balance the budget just by cutting a couple of billion dollars no but you can certainly
[3:43:41.160 --> 3:43:48.360]  destroy your budget one lunch at a time you know when I look at people saying it's only one or two
[3:43:48.360 --> 3:43:53.720]  billion dollar expenditure here and that's not going to be enough to to do something about the
[3:43:53.720 --> 3:44:00.520]  massive deficit that we have here and the mounting debt each year the cumulative deficits it's kind
[3:44:00.520 --> 3:44:06.120]  of like on a personal level if you decide that you are entitled to go to Starbucks each day and
[3:44:06.120 --> 3:44:11.560]  have a five dollar coffee and then you're entitled to have lunch out every day as well and pretty
[3:44:11.560 --> 3:44:16.280]  soon you don't realize it but you don't have any money for the big-dicket items because your money
[3:44:16.280 --> 3:44:22.120]  has just been twitted away on these repetitive expenditures that are all in and of themselves
[3:44:22.120 --> 3:44:27.320]  pretty small and that's what we're seeing with these people in Washington they're saying well
[3:44:27.320 --> 3:44:32.600]  leave NPR alone or leave this group alone because that really doesn't matter too much that will only
[3:44:32.600 --> 3:44:39.880]  save us about one hour of federal spending if we take that entire program out well that's the way
[3:44:39.880 --> 3:44:44.200]  you balance the budget is one of those things at a time that's the way you balance your personal
[3:44:44.200 --> 3:44:49.800]  budget and if you have that kind of sense of entitlement for your Starbucks coffee you're
[3:44:49.800 --> 3:44:55.160]  going to go bankrupt you have to at some point look at what you can afford create a budget
[3:44:55.160 --> 3:44:58.280]  and stick to that and if you don't you're going to go bankrupt as an individual you're going to
[3:44:58.280 --> 3:45:02.200]  go bankrupt as a country but I want to go back to Bush here because not only did he do this real
[3:45:02.200 --> 3:45:08.760]  sinister spin on saying well Trump's travel ban no no no this is all about religion he says
[3:45:09.320 --> 3:45:15.640]  and so he turns this into a right to emigrate there is no right to emigrate and the Constitution
[3:45:15.640 --> 3:45:23.240]  there's a right of free exercise of religion where was W to speak out when people were having their
[3:45:23.240 --> 3:45:29.240]  free exercise trampled on by Obamacare did he get involved in that fight against Obama no
[3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:37.880]  he was totally silent he really couldn't care less if there was a band-aid on the little sisters
[3:45:37.880 --> 3:45:43.560]  of the poor celibate nuns who are not married and they're taking care of elderly poor people and
[3:45:43.560 --> 3:45:47.560]  they're told that against their conscience they have to fund birth control and abortion
[3:45:47.560 --> 3:45:52.680]  through Obamacare they had to go to the Supreme Court to fight it where was George W Bush on all
[3:45:52.680 --> 3:45:58.840]  that well he was probably sitting in his bathtub painting pictures of his feet as we saw from
[3:45:58.840 --> 3:46:03.480]  Guccifer when he hacked his email so he needs to go back and do that because if you're gonna come
[3:46:03.480 --> 3:46:08.680]  out of retirement and you're gonna speak against Donald Trump on the travel ban and try to twist
[3:46:08.680 --> 3:46:13.160]  that into saying that there's some kind of a right to immigration because we have a first
[3:46:13.160 --> 3:46:18.600]  amendment free exercise of speech what hypocrisy from shrub but then he does something else he
[3:46:18.600 --> 3:46:26.280]  takes a side of the media against Trump as well he says the media is essential to democracy no not
[3:46:26.280 --> 3:46:32.360]  really there's nothing about the media there's nothing about CNN or the Washington Post and the
[3:46:32.360 --> 3:46:37.960]  Constitution it says we have a right to free speech but it doesn't say that the professional press
[3:46:37.960 --> 3:46:45.240]  or that the elite of the professional press have a right to a monopoly to cover the White House
[3:46:45.240 --> 3:46:48.680]  see that's what they're upset about they're upset about the fact that they have this sense of
[3:46:48.680 --> 3:46:53.000]  entitlement and they think that they're the only ones who should be allowed to cover the president
[3:46:53.000 --> 3:46:58.760]  and they are entitled to do this regardless of how they spend the information regardless of how they
[3:46:58.760 --> 3:47:05.960]  lie and what Trump is doing is pushing back against this but George W Bush on Monday goes
[3:47:05.960 --> 3:47:11.960]  on NBC and says the media is an essential component to democracy arguing it is necessary
[3:47:11.960 --> 3:47:18.200]  to hold the government accountable well who holds the media accountable see I think Trump has free
[3:47:18.760 --> 3:47:24.040]  speech as well he has a right to speak back as well but when he criticizes the press especially
[3:47:24.040 --> 3:47:30.200]  when he criticizes people who do their job in a very poor very partisan way like CNN and Washington
[3:47:30.200 --> 3:47:37.320]  Post everybody cries first amendment first amendment okay no it's not about that he said
[3:47:37.320 --> 3:47:42.440]  and he goes on to point out that he thinks the problem is totally totally Trump he says power
[3:47:42.440 --> 3:47:47.960]  can be very addictive well you want to see an example of power being addictive take a look at
[3:47:47.960 --> 3:47:52.760]  the mainstream media or even go back and take a look at George Bush himself he said why just
[3:47:52.760 --> 3:47:59.240]  remember when he said I I wish I could be like the Chinese and just sign these orders and make
[3:47:59.240 --> 3:48:04.280]  everybody do what I want them to do okay that's really where his heart is and of course he's now
[3:48:04.280 --> 3:48:09.560]  flown his flag yet again to tell us that he is with the globalists I want to take a look at
[3:48:09.560 --> 3:48:14.520]  another article that was on the dredge report today that I thought was very very concerning
[3:48:15.400 --> 3:48:19.560]  we really need to wake up folks we need to wake up to what's going on here this is off of zero
[3:48:19.560 --> 3:48:25.880]  hedge via dredge welcome aboard but first the us marshals will scan your retina and they're going
[3:48:25.880 --> 3:48:31.720]  into the airport this is somebody talking about how they were flying from Mexico to Mexico from
[3:48:31.720 --> 3:48:38.840]  Atlanta and as they're getting on walking down the jet bridge they said there's a new layer of
[3:48:38.840 --> 3:48:45.960]  security two us marshals heavily armed dressed in dystopian style black regalia stood next to an
[3:48:45.960 --> 3:48:52.600]  upright machine with a glowing green eye every passenger one by one was told to step on a mat
[3:48:52.600 --> 3:48:58.120]  and look into the green scanner it was scanning our eyes and matching that scan with the passport
[3:48:58.120 --> 3:49:03.720]  which was also scanned yet again you understand what's going on here folks at one level they
[3:49:03.720 --> 3:49:07.400]  could say well we're looking to see if any terrorists are leaving our country to go to Mexico
[3:49:08.600 --> 3:49:12.520]  that was one thing you could I guess you could say let's understand what's really going on here
[3:49:13.480 --> 3:49:17.560]  what's really going on here is they're creating a database they're matching your identity where
[3:49:17.560 --> 3:49:21.960]  they've got all that information about you and your passport they're now matching that and creating
[3:49:21.960 --> 3:49:29.400]  a biometric profile of you as well when american people are you going to wake up to this and say
[3:49:29.400 --> 3:49:35.560]  we're not going to go down this road this is very very troubling at the beginning of this article
[3:49:36.120 --> 3:49:39.800]  personally wrote it says for some 15 years they say an airport security becomes steadily more
[3:49:39.800 --> 3:49:46.440]  invasive you know I had a friend of mine in engineering who went to the airspace museum
[3:49:46.440 --> 3:49:50.120]  in washington dc and his comment was he said you know I realized when I went there that the history
[3:49:50.120 --> 3:49:56.840]  of flight in the 20th century was really a history of engine development more than anything it was
[3:49:56.840 --> 3:50:02.600]  about the development of more and more powerful engines and I've thought about that over the years
[3:50:02.600 --> 3:50:10.440]  and over the last 15 years I got to say that the history of flight in the 21st century has become
[3:50:10.440 --> 3:50:16.920]  a shameful history of surveillance and the surveillance state is becoming the engine
[3:50:16.920 --> 3:50:23.560]  of tyranny folks you have to understand the tsa doesn't see themselves as being limited to airports
[3:50:23.560 --> 3:50:29.000]  they're hitting us right now because people spend a lot of money to fly on a plane and they're reluctant
[3:50:29.000 --> 3:50:32.840]  no matter what these people do just as he's saying right here do I throw away my ticket that I've
[3:50:32.840 --> 3:50:35.960]  paid a lot of money for I've made a lot of plans I've got other things that are dependent on this
[3:50:35.960 --> 3:50:40.440]  I just throw that away because these people are going to put me in a biometric database or I can
[3:50:40.440 --> 3:50:44.840]  throw away a couple hundred dollars that I spent an airline ticket most people look at that and no
[3:50:44.840 --> 3:50:48.440]  matter how uncomfortable they are they will descend into this tyranny we've got to say
[3:50:48.440 --> 3:50:50.280]  that's enough stay with us we'll be right back
[3:50:59.320 --> 3:51:04.440]  what if extendivite really works but you find that hard to believe and you spend precious time
[3:51:04.440 --> 3:51:10.600]  looking for someone to say just try it I have my help today because of extendivite and if I did

[3:51:58.760 --> 3:52:04.200]  Hi this is Ron Paul I am a former congressman physician and presidential candidate the world
[3:52:04.200 --> 3:52:10.840]  is in turmoil things like Ebola earthquakes wars and famines are commonplace as Americans we are
[3:52:10.840 --> 3:52:15.800]  largely sheltered from these events however in parts of the world just having enough food is a
[3:52:15.800 --> 3:52:21.240]  huge problem for some of us there is the nagging thought that we may not always have it so good

[3:54:31.960 --> 3:54:38.440]  important this is the limited edition Trump is my president shirt we put out a month before even one

[3:54:42.600 --> 3:54:47.800]  order we put in right after the election ends that promise it was a it was it was a limited edition
[3:54:47.800 --> 3:54:52.600]  Hillary for president 2017 to Port George Soros is on the back that is going to stop as soon as
[3:54:52.600 --> 3:54:57.800]  this run is over as well because it hit me a few weeks ago Trump I knew was going to do more rallies
[3:54:57.800 --> 3:55:01.640]  around the country to energize the base and fight the Democrats and Soros they're trying to cause a
[3:55:01.640 --> 3:55:05.800]  civil war he's got to keep the base fired up to win you know get our agenda through of cutting
[3:55:05.800 --> 3:55:10.760]  taxes curing the border sovereignty basic stuff like that and I thought of a Pence
[3:55:10.760 --> 3:55:19.880]  Trump ticket you know Trump Pence ticket 2020 so I thought let's have a t-shirt that is Trump
[3:55:19.880 --> 3:55:25.800]  Pence 2020 to just put out the idea that hey we're looking into the future of restoring this
[3:55:25.800 --> 3:55:32.600]  republic and the shirt says keeping America great it's on the front it says Trump Pence 2020 keeping
[3:55:32.600 --> 3:55:41.320]  America great and on the back it says America first since 1776 info wars calm and that way
[3:55:41.320 --> 3:55:48.120]  you go to the big Trump rallies and you're able to meet other info warriors you're also able to
[3:55:48.120 --> 3:55:52.440]  you know force the media to understand that info wars is a dominant force you're able to
[3:55:52.440 --> 3:55:56.920]  continue in front of the Trump inner circle not just trump himself to you know keep the flag of
[3:55:56.920 --> 3:56:03.080]  info wars up there and you're also able to on the street not just at these events meet friends
[3:56:03.080 --> 3:56:07.080]  and others that you would never have known who are basically fellow travelers to use their
[3:56:07.080 --> 3:56:12.280]  communist term so that we show solidarity but here's what's most important we've come up with this
[3:56:12.280 --> 3:56:19.240]  Trump 2020 idea so that we can get back in the face of those that want to bully us and tell us
[3:56:19.240 --> 3:56:24.520]  that we can't wear on make America great hats out that you know we can't wear info or shirts out
[3:56:24.520 --> 3:56:28.360]  or they're going to come over and get in our face or be bullies good we're the american people very
[3:56:28.360 --> 3:56:32.920]  race color and creed the human race that want liberty and freedom in our time and so that's
[3:56:32.920 --> 3:56:37.400]  why we're doing this is why we're promoting this and we're going to hit the streets the city council
[3:56:37.400 --> 3:56:41.560]  meetings the state house meetings unanimously they praise their god lucifer we're going to praise our
[3:56:41.560 --> 3:56:48.200]  god johova our god yaoi and his son jesus christ and so it comes down to this folks we have this
[3:56:48.200 --> 3:56:55.880]  new shirt it's 995 made in america printed america 995 and by the time we ship it to you in the rest
[3:56:55.880 --> 3:56:58.600]  of it we really don't even make much profit on that but it also helps from the you know the
[3:56:58.600 --> 3:57:02.840]  operation a little bit but it spreads the word more importantly and so when the shirt officially
[3:57:02.840 --> 3:57:08.360]  comes out we need some funding it's going to be 1995 but for everybody that pre-orders it now it's
[3:57:08.360 --> 3:57:12.200]  being printed right now it'll be shipped in the next week to us we'll start shipping it out to you

[3:57:17.480 --> 3:57:23.240]  back to 1995 so we you know make 12 13 bucks on it which we need to fund the operation nothing
