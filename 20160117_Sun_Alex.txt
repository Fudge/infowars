[00:00.000 --> 00:23.440]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[00:23.440 --> 00:26.800]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:26.800 --> 00:33.440]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live worldwide broadcast.
[00:33.440 --> 00:37.720]  We're going to be here for the next two hours as we are every Sunday at 4 to 6 p.m. Central
[00:37.720 --> 00:40.240]  Standard Time.
[00:40.240 --> 00:45.680]  There is just obviously a ton of news from the pressers being released by Iran.
[00:45.680 --> 00:47.680]  That's supposed to deal.
[00:47.680 --> 00:50.920]  We've got moves towards Hillary Clinton being indicted.
[00:50.920 --> 00:55.400]  We've got a lot of economic news, obviously with Walmart's closing by the hundreds around
[00:55.400 --> 00:57.360]  the country and around the world.
[00:57.360 --> 01:00.840]  All of this is coming up, but first we have to ask ourselves a question.
[01:00.840 --> 01:07.640]  Why is the establishment demonizing new media, patriot media like MFullWars.com and myself?
[01:07.640 --> 01:11.360]  And it's because when you're over the target is when you're getting the flack.
[01:11.360 --> 01:14.760]  Here is a key report by Darren McBrain and we'll be back on the other side.
[01:14.760 --> 01:16.960]  Talk show host is Alex Jones.
[01:16.960 --> 01:19.000]  He's a conspiracy theorist.
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.000]  Radio talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:22.000 --> 01:23.000]  Alex Jones.
[01:23.000 --> 01:24.000]  His name is Alex Jones.
[01:24.000 --> 01:27.120]  Alex Jones is the wildly popular conspiracy theorist.
[01:27.120 --> 01:30.120]  Radio talk show host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.
[01:30.120 --> 01:32.240]  Alex Jones is a nut job radio guy.
[01:32.240 --> 01:33.640]  Talk show host Alex Jones.
[01:33.640 --> 01:38.200]  A man who trades in such sinister conspiracy theories you have to wonder if he really believes
[01:38.200 --> 01:39.200]  half of what he says.
[01:39.200 --> 01:40.200]  I'm here to warn people.
[01:40.200 --> 01:41.800]  You keep telling me to shut up.
[01:41.800 --> 01:42.800]  This isn't a game.
[01:42.800 --> 01:43.800]  Hate speech.
[01:43.800 --> 01:45.760]  Can anything be done to stop the hatred?
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.200]  I think Alex was the one who took the pro gun position.
[01:50.200 --> 01:56.200]  I don't want that man to have a gun.
[01:56.200 --> 01:58.000]  Alex Jones is a 9-11 truther.
[01:58.000 --> 02:01.240]  That conspiracy theory comes from the mother of all conspiracy theories.
[02:01.240 --> 02:03.800]  It's an internet talk show called InfoWars.
[02:03.800 --> 02:06.360]  I heard that on Alex Jones so it's true.
[02:06.360 --> 02:07.360]  Dave.
[02:07.360 --> 02:09.360]  I heard it on Alex Jones so I know it's true.
[02:09.360 --> 02:12.880]  You're making some very serious allegations against the US government saying that they
[02:12.880 --> 02:17.080]  stage attacks, they allow them to occur in the United States against US citizens.
[02:17.080 --> 02:18.080]  Let's declassify.
[02:18.080 --> 02:19.520]  Alex Jones may sound crazy.
[02:19.520 --> 02:22.160]  I think that Alex Jones is a lunatic.
[02:22.160 --> 02:23.160]  That man threatened this country.
[02:23.160 --> 02:24.160]  He is a conspiracy theorist.
[02:24.160 --> 02:25.160]  Deeply I think racist.
[02:25.160 --> 02:28.160]  I just got called racist by MSNBC.
[02:28.160 --> 02:30.360]  I'm considered legit among the crazy.
[02:30.360 --> 02:35.240]  Challenge Alex Jones to a boxing match, show up with a semi-automatic that you got legally
[02:35.240 --> 02:36.240]  and pop him.
[02:36.240 --> 02:37.240]  I'd love to see that.
[02:37.240 --> 02:38.240]  In uniform.
[02:38.240 --> 02:39.240]  Keep shoving lies at your audience, jackasses.
[02:39.240 --> 02:40.240]  I like that guy.
[02:40.240 --> 02:41.240]  That is the best.
[02:41.240 --> 02:58.840]  We have gangsters running this country, criminals, gangsters, but bigger this war gets, the more
[02:58.840 --> 03:13.920]  freedoms we lose, we have a fog that is descended on our entire nation.
[03:13.920 --> 03:17.400]  The globalists are going to blow stuff out of the planet, but Hillary's the one who runs
[03:17.400 --> 03:18.400]  the cover-up.
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.920]  Everything you've heard us talk about is now going to be an old, in triplicate spade.
[03:22.920 --> 03:24.920]  This is real as it gets.
[03:24.920 --> 03:29.720]  I had a Supreme Court justice tell me to my face it's over for me, to man, it's over for
[03:29.720 --> 03:30.720]  you.
[03:30.720 --> 03:32.720]  They've got the votes now to enforce copyright law.
[03:32.720 --> 03:33.720]  You're out of there.
[03:33.720 --> 03:34.720]  You want it, baby?
[03:34.720 --> 03:37.720]  You're about to get it.
[03:37.720 --> 03:49.680]  We just meet the British at Concord Bridge to serve tea, be tolerant and see how many
[03:49.680 --> 03:52.200]  guns or what kind of guns they came to take.
[03:52.200 --> 03:57.320]  We met them at Concord Bridge and we blew their punk ass brains out.
[03:57.320 --> 04:02.680]  Info wars has been able to break every record, infiltrate every operation, blow the criminal
[04:02.680 --> 04:08.880]  cover of operatives more than any other institution out there of freedom, and I'm so proud of
[04:08.880 --> 04:09.880]  that.
[04:09.880 --> 04:14.080]  The notion that Hillary has somehow been an advocate for women, no, Bill rapes them
[04:14.080 --> 04:16.880]  physically and then Hillary rapes them psychologically.
[04:16.880 --> 04:21.960]  I hope the enemies of this broadcast, when you lie about us, when you censor us, when
[04:21.960 --> 04:27.880]  you attack us, when you delist us, when you do that, you're signing on to the other side.
[04:27.880 --> 04:29.880]  These people are all the devil.
[04:29.880 --> 04:32.880]  Let's be very blunt about this.
[04:32.880 --> 04:35.760]  Raise hell and demand accountability.
[04:35.760 --> 04:41.440]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate criminal government in American history.
[04:41.440 --> 04:48.760]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[04:48.760 --> 04:53.200]  We're proud of now moving forward toward the barrier, the police have been telling everybody
[04:53.200 --> 04:56.120]  they're going to shoot if we don't move back.
[04:56.120 --> 04:58.120]  They'll be bad defeat.
[04:58.120 --> 05:01.600]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[05:01.600 --> 05:06.720]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[05:06.720 --> 05:10.000]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[05:10.000 --> 05:15.280]  Just one of the key compounds, BiopQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.
[05:15.280 --> 05:17.800]  You want the best that's out there at the lowest price anywhere?

[06:17.960 --> 06:22.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to be honest with you, I'm not as manly as a lot of the
[06:22.960 --> 06:28.000]  people out there who are going to be watching the Seahawks and the Carolina Panthers coming
[06:28.000 --> 06:30.080]  up here in a little while.
[06:30.080 --> 06:40.400]  In fact, I'm so unmanly that I don't even know who played in the earlier playoffs today.
[06:40.400 --> 06:42.880]  You know, the truth is, I played football in high school.
[06:42.880 --> 06:43.880]  I liked football.
[06:43.880 --> 06:52.240]  I went to Dallas Cowboys games with someone I was a kid and I can sure get into a game.
[06:52.240 --> 06:54.240]  I can sure enjoy it.
[06:54.240 --> 07:00.440]  But you know, when I realized that it's used as a propaganda tool by the social engineers
[07:00.440 --> 07:05.320]  and that the patriotism you see during the game has been paid for with millions of dollars,
[07:05.320 --> 07:10.320]  hundreds of millions of dollars a year of taxpayer money and that it's basically fake.
[07:10.320 --> 07:14.800]  And you learn that there's so much incredible corruption and that they're using it as a
[07:14.800 --> 07:23.080]  political bread and circus, a modern Roman coliseum where that becomes the manhood of
[07:23.080 --> 07:24.080]  the country.
[07:24.080 --> 07:30.920]  Not men being men, not men being informed, not men being politically involved, not men
[07:30.920 --> 07:37.680]  being fighters for freedom, but a bunch of men that act like men that act macho, that
[07:37.680 --> 07:39.180]  act tough.
[07:39.180 --> 07:43.800]  But at the end of the day, rollover to every form of oppression and tyranny there is and
[07:43.800 --> 07:48.160]  to a man when you're talking to them, they don't care about what's happening in the country.
[07:48.160 --> 07:50.320]  They don't care about what's happening in the world.
[07:50.320 --> 07:55.280]  They think it's weird that you're involved, that you're concerned, that you're informed.
[07:55.280 --> 08:01.720]  But boy, they want to talk to you all day about the playoffs and about March Madness
[08:01.720 --> 08:08.560]  coming up in a few months and on and on and on and fantasy this and make believe that
[08:08.560 --> 08:13.360]  it's just as bad as teenagers that live in these fantasy world video games where they
[08:13.360 --> 08:19.920]  have mansions and hot girlfriends and Ferraris in fantasy land.
[08:19.920 --> 08:21.120]  Not in the real world.
[08:21.120 --> 08:24.080]  They are being targeted by propaganda.
[08:24.080 --> 08:30.480]  It's working on them and you sit there and explain to them that it's one thing say in
[08:30.480 --> 08:36.480]  the 1950s if you don't take football too serious to go see your kids play in the game, teaches
[08:36.480 --> 08:38.840]  them leadership, teaches them to be tough.
[08:38.840 --> 08:44.240]  It's great if you're part of the game, if your family's in the game.
[08:44.240 --> 08:51.160]  It's about athleticism, it's about exercise, it's about being manly or about being strong
[08:51.160 --> 08:52.160]  as a woman.
[08:52.160 --> 08:53.160]  I'm all for it.
[08:53.160 --> 08:58.960]  My kids are in swim team and gymnastics and martial arts and tennis, the whole nine yards
[08:58.960 --> 09:03.920]  I get it and I go watch them compete.
[09:03.920 --> 09:09.800]  But I don't, when I had friends on the UT football team, when I was in school, I went
[09:09.800 --> 09:13.720]  to three or four UT football games a year and do you know why I went?
[09:13.720 --> 09:15.200]  I was already on air.
[09:15.200 --> 09:20.040]  I was already anti sports but I went because some of my friends were playing on the field
[09:20.040 --> 09:23.600]  then it was interesting.
[09:23.600 --> 09:29.760]  So I'm not here judging anybody who's into sports.
[09:29.760 --> 09:30.760]  I get it.
[09:30.760 --> 09:31.760]  I've been there.
[09:31.760 --> 09:35.400]  In fact, even though I've been awake, what year was it that the Red Sox finally went
[09:35.400 --> 09:39.840]  back to the World Series like eight, nine, ten years ago?
[09:39.840 --> 09:44.640]  And I was working on a film with a director who was into the Red Sox.
[09:44.640 --> 09:49.560]  And so I started at his office working late and then going out to restaurants or bars
[09:49.560 --> 09:54.160]  with him to watch it up to the World Series, but it just took like a month or whatever
[09:54.160 --> 09:57.600]  but it took over my life.
[09:57.600 --> 10:01.640]  I was calling my wife saying, yeah, I'm sorry, I'm going back out tonight to watch
[10:01.640 --> 10:02.640]  the Red Sox.
[10:02.640 --> 10:03.640]  I mean, I get it folks.
[10:03.640 --> 10:09.760]  If I started watching it within days, if I started watching ESPN, I would be hooked
[10:09.760 --> 10:15.560]  like a ten pound bass on the end of a line right through my lip.
[10:15.560 --> 10:17.120]  I'm not judging you.
[10:17.120 --> 10:18.280]  I get it.
[10:18.280 --> 10:20.720]  I've been there.
[10:20.720 --> 10:27.520]  But just like alcohol, it's addictive and when abused, it is destructive.
[10:27.520 --> 10:29.320]  And there's so much for me to talk about today.
[10:29.320 --> 10:36.160]  So much going on, so much happening, so much unfolding.
[10:36.160 --> 10:39.080]  But when you talk about a culture, what is our culture?
[10:39.080 --> 10:40.080]  What made us great?
[10:40.080 --> 10:46.440]  Being explorers, being innovators, being inventors, learning science, knowing a bunch of languages,
[10:46.440 --> 10:53.800]  traveling the world, building economic systems, developing the world we now enjoy.
[10:53.800 --> 10:59.300]  And now these incredible innovators and trailblazers and rugged individualists that are pure American
[10:59.300 --> 11:06.800]  Americana that made us the special nation we were, the exceptional country we were, heads
[11:06.800 --> 11:13.520]  above the rest, shoulders above the rest, hell they weren't up to our bootstraps, beat
[11:13.520 --> 11:20.560]  the greatest empires in war, beat the greatest empires in innovation, develop the whole
[11:20.560 --> 11:25.680]  modern world, the whole world's culture is American.
[11:25.680 --> 11:30.160]  And then it got conquered by the social engineers by the 70s completely.
[11:30.160 --> 11:32.880]  They already had great toe holes before that in the newspapers.
[11:32.880 --> 11:37.840]  But when TV rolled around in the 30s and became ubiquitous by the 50s and people stopped sitting
[11:37.840 --> 11:42.840]  around the table, listened to stories from mom and dad about work and about life, kids
[11:42.840 --> 11:43.840]  stopped growing.
[11:43.840 --> 11:49.480]  They became arrested development because now they were being raised by the television.
[11:49.480 --> 11:53.240]  Now the state and the media was the center of their life.
[11:53.240 --> 11:59.280]  Now there was a Jim Jones cult leader every single morning and every single lunch and
[11:59.280 --> 12:05.480]  every single dinner telling you what to believe, telling you what to think, telling you how
[12:05.480 --> 12:06.480]  to behave.
[12:06.480 --> 12:07.960]  And boy, it knew how to sucker people.
[12:07.960 --> 12:14.480]  The first stuff it put out for a decade or so was wholesome and fun and strong and good
[12:14.480 --> 12:19.160]  and Americana and people are like, I love TV, that's a big juicy worm on the end of that
[12:19.160 --> 12:23.520]  hook, yum, but then within a decade or so.
[12:23.520 --> 12:26.680]  Suddenly the males on the shows were idiots.
[12:26.680 --> 12:29.040]  Suddenly the women were the bosses.
[12:29.040 --> 12:32.520]  Suddenly the state had to take your rights to keep you safe.
[12:32.520 --> 12:38.160]  Suddenly there were other messages being brought in.
[12:38.160 --> 12:42.760]  And there we were being desensitized, being controlled and the systems written countless
[12:42.760 --> 12:46.080]  books, countless university studies, white papers.
[12:46.080 --> 12:49.360]  They had the Stanford research studies.
[12:49.360 --> 12:50.360]  They had others.
[12:50.360 --> 12:56.680]  Those were more than seven famous ones where they were able to get nine out of 10 or more
[12:56.680 --> 13:06.520]  people to murder subjects in the graduate student and PhD programs.
[13:06.520 --> 13:07.520]  Look them up.
[13:07.520 --> 13:15.560]  They're a bunch of famous studies, just type in famous study where students believe they
[13:15.560 --> 13:18.160]  were killing subjects.
[13:18.160 --> 13:23.480]  And when an authority figure stood there, their professor by successful approximation
[13:23.480 --> 13:29.280]  took a week or so of them slowly torturing people they believed with actors.
[13:29.280 --> 13:35.320]  With electric shocks to then say kill them and most people would then kill or what they
[13:35.320 --> 13:40.560]  believe was murder under peer pressure from an authority figure.
[13:40.560 --> 13:43.640]  That's the Milgram experiment.
[13:43.640 --> 13:47.640]  An obedience to authority figures.
[13:47.640 --> 13:50.560]  And that's what this has all been about, ladies and gentlemen.
[13:50.560 --> 13:55.400]  And so they tell you the authority figures are all these ridiculously corrupt sports
[13:55.400 --> 13:59.680]  icons that are just like corrupt rock stars.
[13:59.680 --> 14:03.640]  To me, the rock stars that have reformed themselves and been leaders in their communities and
[14:03.640 --> 14:07.800]  stood up for American freedom are heroes.
[14:07.800 --> 14:12.800]  Not just because somebody's got $100 million and a hot girlfriend and uses a bunch of drugs.
[14:12.800 --> 14:15.040]  That's not a role model.
[14:15.040 --> 14:18.680]  And I know we know this, but why is it being force fed?
[14:18.680 --> 14:22.640]  I remember reading 20 something years ago in different publications that were a little
[14:22.640 --> 14:27.240]  bit more brainy that the CIA by the 50s have put out a worldwide program to put out ugly
[14:27.240 --> 14:33.320]  art to discredit beautiful art because they wanted to destroy the discrimination factors
[14:33.320 --> 14:37.560]  in the brain between what is good and what is bad.
[14:37.560 --> 14:40.400]  They wanted us rudderless.
[14:40.400 --> 14:41.920]  Then there's the Stanford prison experiment.
[14:41.920 --> 14:49.880]  Yes, both of them basically did the same thing.
[14:49.880 --> 14:52.920]  And once they've got you rudderless, it's all over.
[14:52.920 --> 14:59.600]  Just last year they came out with a headline, CIA funded ugly and deviant art.
[14:59.600 --> 15:04.320]  See now they're telling the whole public, I shot a video earlier on Facebook mentions
[15:04.320 --> 15:08.480]  and it's something I talked about last week several times.
[15:08.480 --> 15:13.640]  And sure enough I've gotten emails, I've seen comments, when this is a YouTube video tomorrow,
[15:13.640 --> 15:17.600]  you will see comments beneath us saying it's not true.
[15:17.600 --> 15:23.720]  It doesn't matter I'm holding up MIT technology review.
[15:23.720 --> 15:29.840]  It doesn't matter you can go to their website and read, human animal chimeras are gestating
[15:29.840 --> 15:32.520]  on US research farms.
[15:32.520 --> 15:37.160]  A radical new approach to generating human organs is to grow them inside pigs or sheep.
[15:37.160 --> 15:38.160]  Also cows.
[15:38.160 --> 15:42.920]  They grow a larger humanoid up inside the animal and harvest it.
[15:42.920 --> 15:48.560]  I was telling you about this 20 years ago, but again the point is even today the public
[15:48.560 --> 15:50.600]  can't admit this is happening.
[15:50.600 --> 15:53.080]  And through this story you understand everything.
[15:53.080 --> 15:54.560]  Is the Mark of the Beast real?
[15:54.560 --> 15:56.560]  We'll get into that too.
[15:56.560 --> 16:00.320]  I am Mark Kennedy, I will reveal this line, line, line.
[16:00.320 --> 16:05.040]  And it's that type of behavior that spurred me to do the research to develop a true
[16:05.040 --> 16:10.040]  nutraceutical formula that was designed to smooth out and help children focus.
[16:10.040 --> 16:12.720]  All of our children are hit with modern mind control.
[16:12.720 --> 16:18.120]  Television, music, fast food, GMOs, sugars, you name it, young humans have not yet developed
[16:18.120 --> 16:22.640]  their nervous system and are being hammered daily by globalist concoctions.
[16:22.640 --> 16:27.160]  It's no wonder they can't focus and calm down and then are put on dangerous psychotropic
[16:27.160 --> 16:28.160]  drugs.
[16:28.160 --> 16:32.080]  Working with my team we set out to find the best formula with the highest quality ingredients
[16:32.080 --> 16:34.120]  that children would actually like and take.
[16:34.120 --> 16:37.680]  We worked with the leading manufacturer and nutritional supplements that are safe for
[16:37.680 --> 16:42.280]  children to bring you the most affordable and powerful calming formula out there.

[19:07.160 --> 19:08.160]  Talk about the effects.
[19:08.160 --> 19:12.200]  I feel great when I wake up in the morning, I have drive to go to the gym, I feel like
[19:12.200 --> 19:14.920]  I look better, I feel better, I feel sexier.

[20:01.720 --> 20:10.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:10.400 --> 20:26.560]  We are on the march, the empire is on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[20:26.560 --> 20:30.280]  I am going to start getting into the news right now.
[20:30.280 --> 20:38.960]  I'm going to open the phones up on this live Sunday broadcast, but I earlier, I'm very
[20:38.960 --> 20:42.160]  proud of the fact I've said that the wrong playoff was coming up.
[20:42.160 --> 20:45.000]  That playoff had already happened because I don't watch it, I don't pay attention to
[20:45.000 --> 20:46.000]  it.
[20:46.000 --> 20:54.440]  I instead had a Bible study with my children today, and I'm going to talk some about that
[20:54.440 --> 20:56.560]  in the second hour today.
[20:56.560 --> 21:01.480]  Is the Mark of the Beast real?
[21:01.480 --> 21:05.520]  And the answer is yes, it is real.
[21:05.520 --> 21:12.880]  And the answer is we're going to end up living under it, and no one is going to be raptured
[21:12.880 --> 21:16.960]  out of it.
[21:16.960 --> 21:21.600]  Now when I say that, many of my Christian listeners and viewers get extremely angry and say that
[21:21.600 --> 21:28.760]  I'm basically bad, they're going to stop listening to me.
[21:28.760 --> 21:31.320]  That means you're in a cult.
[21:31.320 --> 21:37.960]  If someone disagrees with you about something in the Bible, and it's not the deity of Jesus
[21:37.960 --> 21:45.040]  Christ or the Trinity, then you've got a problem and have become a Pharisee.
[21:45.040 --> 21:49.640]  And the reason we have tens of thousands of different denominations in this world is because
[21:49.640 --> 21:54.200]  everyone's in fighting with each other, claiming they know the way and they have the answers.
[21:54.200 --> 22:01.840]  If you want to believe in a rapture, that is your business and I'm not judging you for
[22:01.840 --> 22:02.840]  it.
[22:02.840 --> 22:05.760]  And I don't think you're of the devil.
[22:05.760 --> 22:11.240]  You have been grievously deceived.
[22:11.240 --> 22:16.880]  Now I could go to the Bible and show people this all day long, and I'm going to talk about
[22:16.880 --> 22:19.880]  it the next hour.
[22:19.880 --> 22:29.920]  The folks really should use their heads in all of this.
[22:29.920 --> 22:34.000]  And just ask yourselves, did John the Baptist get raptured out, did Jesus get raptured out,
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.920]  did the disciples, almost all of them who were killed, did they get raptured out?
[22:37.920 --> 22:43.880]  Did the folks in the fiery furnace get raptured out?
[22:43.880 --> 22:48.760]  Did George Washington get raptured out when he prayed to God for Providence to beat the
[22:48.760 --> 22:54.960]  British Empire that no one else had defeated?
[22:54.960 --> 23:01.320]  And the answer is God would protect his people many times at a point and Providence was clear,
[23:01.320 --> 23:03.480]  but you have to go through the fire first.
[23:03.480 --> 23:09.240]  You have to be willing to be put to the sword until God acts.
[23:09.240 --> 23:14.880]  And in many cases, like the Christians and the Coliseum, God doesn't take action because
[23:14.880 --> 23:23.840]  it's part of the plan that they be martyrs to spread the faith.
[23:23.840 --> 23:33.720]  But how do you get a billion Christians to lay down and to not be involved and let the
[23:33.720 --> 23:36.360]  devil take over the world?
[23:36.360 --> 23:38.960]  How do you do that?
[23:38.960 --> 23:44.280]  Well, you tell them they're not going to have to face judgment.
[23:44.280 --> 23:48.160]  They're not going to have to face crises and evil on this planet that they should just
[23:48.160 --> 23:58.480]  lay down to everything and you teach them Romans 13 out of context so that they submit.
[23:58.480 --> 24:02.320]  And I want to be clear to the atheist listeners, the agnostic listeners, and a lot of other
[24:02.320 --> 24:07.160]  people who I don't hate, who I respect.
[24:07.160 --> 24:13.800]  I understand why you reject religion and Christianity because it has become nothing but temples
[24:13.800 --> 24:17.560]  to men and twisted garbage.
[24:17.560 --> 24:23.480]  Christ himself beat the money changers, the religious controllers who were there just
[24:23.480 --> 24:30.920]  collecting money from the people and manipulating.
[24:30.920 --> 24:38.400]  But the deeper you get into research into the globalist operations, the more you realize
[24:38.400 --> 24:50.240]  that there is a major dominant spiritual element to all of this.
[24:50.240 --> 24:55.120]  And whether you believe there is another dimension to the universe, whether you believe that
[24:55.120 --> 24:59.440]  there are spiritual dimensions of the universe, whether you believe that there's anything
[24:59.440 --> 25:07.040]  going on in the world around you that you can't see, the elites are into the occult,
[25:07.040 --> 25:08.720]  which just means hidden.
[25:08.720 --> 25:11.720]  They are very into the esoteric.
[25:11.720 --> 25:21.320]  They are obsessed with it and none of them that I've met are atheists.
[25:21.320 --> 25:33.560]  That is a modern pseudoscientific mindset or group or cult that is very close-minded
[25:33.560 --> 25:36.560]  about a lot of things.
[25:36.560 --> 25:46.280]  Mathematics has shown other dimensions, mathematics has proven much of what's in the Bible, and
[25:46.280 --> 25:54.240]  the Bible so accurately predicts technological developments that we're now seeing today.
[25:54.240 --> 26:01.080]  So whether you believe in the Mark of the Beast or not, a cashless society is coming.
[26:01.080 --> 26:08.960]  A cashless society is going to have hellish ramifications for everyone, and we won't be
[26:08.960 --> 26:15.560]  able to probably stop it, but we have a responsibility to resist it and hold it back as long as
[26:15.560 --> 26:24.440]  possible so that when it comes into fruition, it's used by God to wake up a lot of people
[26:24.440 --> 26:29.880]  to not go along with it and to then defeat it quicker.
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.600]  But even if you're not religious or not a Christian or not, you should be against the
[26:33.600 --> 26:37.280]  cashless society, so I'm going to talk some about that today before I get into the Mark
[26:37.280 --> 26:40.360]  of the Beast so that we can really discuss how it's being used.
[26:40.360 --> 26:42.760]  Here's an example.
[26:42.760 --> 26:49.360]  Well, I'll just do it when we get to that point, but there are major companies in Europe
[26:49.360 --> 26:51.920]  making people take microchips to work there.
[26:51.920 --> 26:57.920]  There are people now flying through the airport, checkpoints, lid their microchips.
[26:57.920 --> 27:00.040]  It's all being sold, it's all being massaged.
[27:00.040 --> 27:04.600]  I remember reading in Wash Tech, it was a technical publication in the Washington Post
[27:04.600 --> 27:09.760]  in like 1999, they were talking to the Defense Department and others and they said, yeah,
[27:09.760 --> 27:14.920]  we're working with the media for the future trends to promote body modification, to prepare
[27:14.920 --> 27:21.120]  the public to take implantable chips for commerce, that's our final goal.
[27:21.120 --> 27:26.400]  And there's all these great things that brain chips and chips in the eyes can do wonderful
[27:26.400 --> 27:29.720]  things that I would want myself for my family.
[27:29.720 --> 27:37.160]  I'm just saying you got to ask what the givers are Trojan horsing into all this and understand
[27:37.160 --> 27:41.080]  everything that we've been technologically given by the establishment that they've allowed
[27:41.080 --> 27:50.120]  to become standardized has been turned around and used as a tool to dumb us down.
[27:50.120 --> 27:55.400]  Steve Jobs would not let his children have an iPad.
[27:55.400 --> 27:59.800]  All the Apple execs say no, it destroys cognitive ability, it brain damages them.
[27:59.800 --> 28:05.400]  Just type in screen time causes brain damage, screen time lowers cognitive ability.
[28:05.400 --> 28:07.400]  I mean, you'll get mainstream news.
[28:07.400 --> 28:11.120]  They're not even hiding it from you, it's just like a drug insert tells you, you know,
[28:11.120 --> 28:12.120]  kill you.
[28:12.120 --> 28:21.240]  They're like, oh, here's your drug, by the way, read the insert.
[28:21.240 --> 28:26.880]  That's all I'm saying is there's a master plan admitted to against humanity that is
[28:26.880 --> 28:27.880]  extremely destructive.
[28:27.880 --> 28:32.160]  Okay, I'm going to get into all that in the second hour and open the phones up.
[28:32.160 --> 28:38.320]  When I come back, we're going to get into CIA spokesman slams 13 hours as distortion
[28:38.320 --> 28:40.320]  of Benghazi events.
[28:40.320 --> 28:42.960]  So I want to say good for the film admitting there was a stand down.
[28:42.960 --> 28:45.360]  That's a big deal.
[28:45.360 --> 28:49.360]  We've also got the latest on the economy, which is so important.
[28:49.360 --> 28:54.680]  The latest on the Iran sanctioned deal and the captives being returned and more stay
[28:54.680 --> 28:57.440]  with us.
[28:57.440 --> 29:01.440]  Secret 12 info wars life vitamin B12 formulation.
[29:01.440 --> 29:06.720]  Most forms of vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic and could not be properly absorbed
[29:06.720 --> 29:07.720]  by the body.
[29:07.720 --> 29:12.560]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are
[29:12.560 --> 29:17.480]  known to have higher absorption rates info wars life.com is excited to announce that

[29:22.040 --> 29:24.160]  exclusive perfected process.

[29:30.880 --> 29:35.120]  the same kind used in B12 injections and adenosylcobalamin.
[29:35.120 --> 29:38.480]  Secret 12 is simply taken by mouth right on the tongue and then swallowed.

[30:08.560 --> 30:12.520]  and be able to watch the mountain is live reports, the special reports, all my films,
[30:12.520 --> 30:14.720]  ebooks and so much more.
[30:14.720 --> 30:18.360]  One person can share their membership with 20 people.
[30:18.360 --> 30:22.360]  We have to have our own platform that is harder for them to censor, harder for the system
[30:22.360 --> 30:23.440]  to shut down.
[30:23.440 --> 30:28.160]  Prisonplanet.tv, we put out the daily radio show free with the video and audio feeds at
[30:28.160 --> 30:34.120]  infowars.com forward slash show, but it is the members that are paying it forward and
[30:34.120 --> 30:42.000]  helping so many other people see the truth and it's prisonplanet.tv that finances so
[30:42.000 --> 30:45.320]  much of the cameras, the equipment, the crew, the reporters.

[30:49.640 --> 30:51.140]  it with friends and family.
[30:51.140 --> 30:58.080]  It's a win-win and then you're helping finance to put it out for free to everybody, prisonplanet.tv.

[31:28.880 --> 31:31.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've been on this the last few months.
[31:31.040 --> 31:35.080]  You probably noticed I've been more focused, less brain fog, more energy and it's because
[31:35.080 --> 31:36.080]  of brain force.
[31:36.080 --> 31:39.040]  There's always hidden additives in your food, even organic food has hidden additives.
[31:39.040 --> 31:42.680]  I'm staring at the computer all day working doing good, you're still damaging your brain.
[31:42.680 --> 31:44.760]  Ultimately we've all been dumbed down to some degree.
[31:44.760 --> 31:48.000]  It doesn't have stimulus, it doesn't have garbage in it, it has natural things that
[31:48.000 --> 31:49.000]  do it clean.
[31:49.000 --> 31:56.000]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[32:54.520 --> 33:19.160]  Check it out for yourself today.
[33:19.160 --> 33:26.840]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[33:26.840 --> 33:33.560]  I'm going to go ahead and double the phones up for the next hour, but you'll be on hold
[33:33.560 --> 33:34.560]  for a while.
[33:34.560 --> 33:42.800]  You want to start calling in or getting ready specifically on the Mark of the Beast revelations,
[33:42.800 --> 33:51.240]  the rapture, do you believe in a pre, mid, or post rapture?
[33:51.240 --> 33:54.280]  And whether you believe in God or not, whether you believe in Christianity or not, whether
[33:54.280 --> 33:59.280]  you believe in the Bible or not, this is what supposedly over a billion people believe in
[33:59.280 --> 34:01.160]  the world.
[34:01.160 --> 34:06.520]  And what's described in the Bible, a cashless society, is basically almost here and it does
[34:06.520 --> 34:08.360]  make us incredibly dependent.
[34:08.360 --> 34:10.840]  It does allow control over the economy.
[34:10.840 --> 34:14.240]  It does allow major financial institutions to rig the stock market.
[34:14.240 --> 34:15.240]  That's admitted.
[34:15.240 --> 34:22.000]  And for Google to even predict the future by tracking millions of different human actions
[34:22.000 --> 34:23.000]  every hour.
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.400]  By the way, print me some articles about that.
[34:25.400 --> 34:27.720]  I just want to show folks.
[34:27.720 --> 34:30.920]  Google intended to be artificially intelligent.
[34:30.920 --> 34:36.640]  That's why our magazine last year, the articles about Google can predict the future just so
[34:36.640 --> 34:40.520]  I can show people because I want to do a report next hour on this and folks will be
[34:40.520 --> 34:41.520]  watching.
[34:41.520 --> 34:42.520]  Folks will be listening.
[34:42.520 --> 34:48.440]  I want to source all this because, again, the general public technologically and their
[34:48.440 --> 34:51.360]  understanding is about 40 years behind.
[34:51.360 --> 34:57.720]  So people need to understand what this is all really about while they're busy.
[34:57.720 --> 35:02.400]  Watching the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Denver Broncos, who I guess are playing right now,
[35:02.400 --> 35:05.960]  or they were busy watching the other pointless game, the Carolina Panthers and the Seattle
[35:05.960 --> 35:14.840]  Seahawks, things like that, the real world's going on.
[35:14.840 --> 35:20.120]  Now, there's a lot of propaganda in entertainment.
[35:20.120 --> 35:24.000]  And so we analyze entertainment.
[35:24.000 --> 35:27.200]  And one of the things I want to get into first before I hit the economy, because it all ties
[35:27.200 --> 35:31.320]  together, is Michael Bay's 13 Hours.
[35:31.320 --> 35:36.760]  I got a call from the Daily Beast wanting me to do a review of it.
[35:36.760 --> 35:40.120]  I got a call from the Huffington Post who's called me before wanting me to do a movie
[35:40.120 --> 35:41.120]  review.
[35:41.120 --> 35:42.960]  So I just said, I don't have time to write it.
[35:42.960 --> 35:47.120]  Then another reporter called up and said, well, just talk to me and we want your review.
[35:47.120 --> 35:48.920]  And it's not like I'm some big shot.
[35:48.920 --> 35:54.360]  It's just that that's not what I do.
[35:54.360 --> 35:55.560]  And I said, I haven't seen it yet.
[35:55.560 --> 35:56.760]  Then they called me back a day later.
[35:56.760 --> 35:57.760]  Have you seen it yet?
[35:57.760 --> 35:58.960]  And I said, no.
[35:58.960 --> 36:03.840]  But Tim Kennedy, my friend, and Shane Steiner, my friend, they went and saw it the other
[36:03.840 --> 36:04.840]  day.
[36:04.840 --> 36:07.840]  And they said it was a really good movie and pretty accurate from what Kennedy knows.
[36:07.840 --> 36:13.040]  And of course, he's a green beret, was a master sergeant or whatever it is, done a
[36:13.040 --> 36:17.240]  lot of combat, done a lot of stuff clandestinely that's pretty famous and folks do.
[36:17.240 --> 36:18.640]  That's kind of an oxymoron.
[36:18.640 --> 36:22.560]  Pretty famous and folks do, but taking out some really high level people.
[36:22.560 --> 36:26.200]  He fell off tonight.
[36:26.200 --> 36:28.120]  But then I went ahead today and I said, okay, that's it.
[36:28.120 --> 36:32.000]  I'm going to go read the full spoiler because I was intended to go see it, but I've been
[36:32.000 --> 36:33.000]  so busy.
[36:33.000 --> 36:36.360]  And I generally only go see a movie if there is some political angle so I can cover it.
[36:36.360 --> 36:42.720]  I mean, I'm that serious because the real world so much more interesting than some movie.
[36:42.720 --> 36:54.600]  So I read the 15 page spoiler and I'd say it's about 85% accurate.
[36:54.600 --> 37:00.120]  And that's saying a lot, you know, I've been somewhat critical of Michael Bay, the director,
[37:00.120 --> 37:03.440]  but I guess he just makes super heads to be able to then be so successful he can make
[37:03.440 --> 37:05.120]  good movies.
[37:05.120 --> 37:09.920]  But they do talk about it being a direct stand down from the CIA and the State Department
[37:09.920 --> 37:15.000]  to the CIA security people who are former Navy SEALs.
[37:15.000 --> 37:18.080]  And of course, we know there was a stand down.
[37:18.080 --> 37:25.960]  A, we've talked to insiders, but more importantly, Benghazi was about an hour and a half away
[37:25.960 --> 37:33.800]  or less from giant U.S. bases, response bases in southern Italy.
[37:33.800 --> 37:39.840]  And it was only 20 minutes away from naval ships with fighter bombers on board.
[37:39.840 --> 37:43.120]  And they had response forces nearby as well.
[37:43.120 --> 37:48.320]  They ordered a stand down, the word went out, and a bunch of the people started evacuating
[37:48.320 --> 37:50.480]  hours and hours before.
[37:50.480 --> 37:52.880]  But they don't sit there while a firefight's going on.
[37:52.880 --> 37:54.200]  The whole thing took 13 hours.
[37:54.200 --> 37:57.120]  Well, the movie's called 13 Hours.
[37:57.120 --> 38:02.120]  But we've been covering it from the cutting edge from Colonel Schaefer and whistleblowers
[38:02.120 --> 38:08.320]  and CIA whistleblowers, Tosh Plumley and others.
[38:08.320 --> 38:13.600]  From the first week of it happening, we told you it was about the arms in those warehouses.
[38:13.600 --> 38:14.600]  Al-Qaeda wanted it.
[38:14.600 --> 38:16.440]  Al-Qaeda was running security in Benghazi.
[38:16.440 --> 38:21.120]  The ally of Hillary and Obama to launch the war against Qaddafi, then they used them against
[38:21.120 --> 38:22.120]  Egypt, Syria.
[38:22.120 --> 38:26.080]  Remember, we told you about this four or five years ago, now it's mainstream news.
[38:26.080 --> 38:29.200]  Trump gets up and says, Hillary and Obama created ISIS.
[38:29.200 --> 38:33.120]  Yes, and Al-Qaeda created them.
[38:33.120 --> 38:40.480]  So our government backed Al-Qaeda, Al-Nazra in a takeover of a bunch of countries.
[38:40.480 --> 38:46.760]  You can read our articles going back to the year it happened, 2013, there it is on headline.
[38:46.760 --> 38:50.480]  Confirmed Benghazi was cover up of arms transferred to Al-Qaeda.
[38:50.480 --> 38:55.920]  And then we even give you the whistleblowers with their names.
[38:55.920 --> 38:59.520]  And then the State Department and the Justice Department called up Schaefer, called up Plumley,
[38:59.520 --> 39:01.600]  called up others and said,
[39:01.600 --> 39:06.040]  Well, I can't tell what Schaefer's told me, but the point is, is that they threatened
[39:06.040 --> 39:11.480]  to arrest Plumley.
[39:11.480 --> 39:15.880]  And a bunch of other whistleblowers, so I'm not tooting our horn, but we brought you all
[39:15.880 --> 39:20.080]  the intel on exactly how it all unfolded.
[39:20.080 --> 39:24.800]  We told you it was weapons deals out of the State Department that Congress or the Pentagon
[39:24.800 --> 39:28.200]  wouldn't approve through Hillary for money to her foundation.
[39:28.200 --> 39:32.080]  We told you that three years ago before the Clinton Foundation was even discussed.
[39:32.080 --> 39:36.320]  Gee, how do you think it got into certain channels to become an issue?
[39:36.320 --> 39:38.680]  We detonated the detonator.
[39:38.680 --> 39:41.520]  We don't get the credit, which is fine.
[39:41.520 --> 39:48.160]  And then now it's all over the news, kind of like we had Tim Kennedy on Wednesday about
[39:48.160 --> 39:52.760]  the Al-Qaeda being in Texas trying to come kill him in his house and the FBI.
[39:52.760 --> 39:54.840]  What was on Fox Friday and yesterday?
[39:54.840 --> 40:00.480]  What was on CNN, Tim Kennedy, again, breaking the news, breaking the news, breaking the
[40:00.480 --> 40:01.480]  news.
[40:01.480 --> 40:06.160]  We told you two years ago with video, with the emergency manager in South Texas admitting
[40:06.160 --> 40:09.600]  their order to bring the illegals in, let them on buses, give them vouchers to release
[40:09.600 --> 40:13.680]  them without ID anywhere they want in the U.S. New York Times six months later had to admit
[40:13.680 --> 40:14.680]  it.
[40:14.680 --> 40:21.400]  Then of course, nobody in our office thought it was a big story when we did it Wednesday.
[40:21.400 --> 40:22.400]  I'm not mad.
[40:22.400 --> 40:26.120]  Yesterday, I had the guys posted to infowars.com and it was national news, so you can see the
[40:26.120 --> 40:30.480]  video posted since yesterday, but it was live on Wednesday and Thursday.
[40:30.480 --> 40:31.480]  We also talked to him.
[40:31.480 --> 40:38.040]  But the point is, is that we know what we're talking about and I don't want to sit up here
[40:38.040 --> 40:39.240]  and toot our horn.
[40:39.240 --> 40:42.720]  It's just people need to listen to us.
[40:42.720 --> 40:48.400]  Now an unnamed CIA person, wow, that's a big deal, the CIA, how glitzy, I mean millions
[40:48.400 --> 40:51.920]  of people work for the CIA, hundreds of thousands of operatives.
[40:51.920 --> 40:53.800]  It's like a giant cancer.
[40:53.800 --> 41:00.920]  CIA spokesman slams 13 hours as distortion of Benghazi events, gives no proof, has no
[41:00.920 --> 41:07.040]  name, goes by Bob, Bob the BS artist and says there was no stand down.
[41:07.040 --> 41:11.240]  The stand down is admitted, the stand down has come out, everybody knows there was a
[41:11.240 --> 41:12.240]  stand down.
[41:12.240 --> 41:22.440]  Can you imagine when a State Department mission, a safe house, has the ambassador for eight
[41:22.440 --> 41:27.640]  hours on the radio and the sat phone saying help us and no one comes and then six guys
[41:27.640 --> 41:32.640]  down the road refuse to follow the stand down order and go down there and light them up.
[41:32.640 --> 41:38.560]  Then they put out this info in the Pentagon going, well, Ambassador Stevens was gay.
[41:38.560 --> 41:42.440]  I remember hearing this a weekend to it and I've had high-level people go, well, isn't
[41:42.440 --> 41:44.920]  this the story, Alex?
[41:44.920 --> 41:49.760]  Ambassador Stevens was gay and Ambassador Stevens had done local things, that's another
[41:49.760 --> 41:56.000]  fake story like this guy insulting the Prophet Muhammad with this trailer for his movie.
[41:56.000 --> 41:57.520]  That's admittedly not why they riot.
[41:57.520 --> 42:02.680]  Well, then they said it was because he did things locally with younger people and then
[42:02.680 --> 42:07.000]  no proof, no evidence and I've talked to folks that had nothing to do with it.
[42:07.000 --> 42:12.720]  Do you think a group of al-Qaeda running security in Benghazi, running that town as the main
[42:12.720 --> 42:16.800]  invasion base, Egypt wouldn't go along with it, that's one of the reasons they were taken
[42:16.800 --> 42:22.760]  down a year later, who barks and I'm not going along with this, al-Qaeda admittedly
[42:22.760 --> 42:23.760]  rapes boys.
[42:23.760 --> 42:26.240]  The Koreans says they can, according to their interpretation.
[42:26.240 --> 42:28.200]  They rape young girls, they sell them a six slaves.
[42:28.200 --> 42:31.480]  You think even if Stevens did that, which the evidence is he didn't, you think they
[42:31.480 --> 42:32.680]  really wouldn't kill him over that?
[42:32.680 --> 42:35.200]  It's all bull.
[42:35.200 --> 42:40.560]  And so now they're criticizing Michael Bay, I just want to say good for him getting a
[42:40.560 --> 42:42.800]  lot of accurate stuff in the movie.
[42:42.800 --> 42:48.440]  So now I'm going to go see it because I want to reward good media that tells the truth.
[42:48.440 --> 42:53.080]  So there's a fight even in Hollywood folks to tell the truth and it's hard to suppress
[42:53.080 --> 42:54.080]  the truth.
[42:54.080 --> 42:55.080]  We'll be back with the economy.
[42:55.080 --> 42:57.080]  Stay with us.
[42:57.080 --> 43:26.400]  And
[43:26.400 --> 43:31.920]  early trading and was down 2.68% or around 474 points near the end of the day. China's
[43:31.920 --> 43:35.920]  Hanxing index stayed negative territory most of the day while Indonesia's currency crashed
[43:35.920 --> 43:39.600]  in response to the terrorist attack likely to be blamed on ISIS. There's no doubt the
[43:39.600 --> 43:43.760]  attacks' effects on Asian stock markets will also shock US markets, especially considering
[43:43.760 --> 43:50.320]  the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 16,151 on Wednesday, down over 1,500 points in the past
[43:50.320 --> 43:55.040]  10 trading days. Check back on Infowars.com and Prismplanet.com for more economic news.

[47:56.560 --> 48:04.400]  in-house here on those days 877-789-2539 what do you think about this whole rapture situation
[48:04.400 --> 48:14.800]  is the mark of the beast real because obviously it's here i'm going to break down the type of
[48:14.800 --> 48:21.840]  world we're going to live in under this antichrist system everything controlled everything
[48:21.840 --> 48:28.800]  distorted a false reality forced into our consciousness to deceive even the elect that
[48:28.800 --> 48:34.720]  is the modern antichrist system and i tell you if i was ever a doubting thomas in my life which i
[48:34.720 --> 48:41.040]  never was but you still academically doubt boy i tell you it is bone shilling how real all this
[48:41.040 --> 48:46.480]  is and how scripture is being fulfilled and again if you're an atheist me and my point is
[48:46.480 --> 48:50.960]  look at the dehumanization look at the genetic engineering look at the elite saying they're
[48:50.960 --> 48:56.480]  going to merge with machines and become gods look at humans being grown inside cows and sheep
[48:56.480 --> 49:03.920]  to harvest their organs this isn't the x-files folks this is the real world and it goes on and
[49:03.920 --> 49:08.400]  on and on but if it's admitted in just an mit magazine nobody cares
[49:16.240 --> 49:17.280]  i just thought of something
[49:17.280 --> 49:26.720]  i have a responsibility to go to these facilities and to get answers and to just
[49:26.720 --> 49:30.560]  show people it's just like Planned Parenthood infiltration they're now suing that group that
[49:30.560 --> 49:36.160]  infiltrated Planned Parenthood by every yardstick is committing crimes shelling the body parts
[49:36.160 --> 49:39.840]  they lie to the public and said they weren't they don't tell women they're selling the body parts
[49:39.840 --> 49:45.760]  other abortion facilities have been caught keeping babies alive for harvesting
[49:47.200 --> 49:53.280]  my dad's a physician retired and i remember going to get my driver's license when i was 15
[49:53.920 --> 49:56.880]  my hardship license act because i had a job at a small animal vet
[49:58.400 --> 49:59.920]  so i got my license a year early
[50:02.160 --> 50:08.160]  and he said son don't sign that organ donor card and my dad was the type of guy that said you know
[50:08.160 --> 50:13.120]  HIV is a bio weapon it only really affects Africans it's very hard for a white person to get it
[50:14.320 --> 50:20.320]  the team lymphocytes get killed by heavy metals and bad processed drugs only drug addicts that
[50:20.320 --> 50:26.800]  are Caucasian can get it with rundown immune systems and it's a bio weapon race specific and
[50:26.800 --> 50:30.800]  then later that all came out that's how smart my dad is i would call him a quote conspiracy theorist
[50:30.800 --> 50:38.160]  because nobody in the house thought that you know it was just he knew what he was talking about
[50:38.160 --> 50:42.240]  and you know he did the dental work on the deputy director of the CIA and stuff like that so
[50:42.240 --> 50:50.720]  you know people listen to him but i just took it like it was just dad sitting there at the
[50:50.720 --> 50:55.360]  dinner table talking but when he said don't do that a lot of times they won't give you treatment
[50:55.360 --> 51:01.680]  and will actually kill you at the hospital for your organs and i said what is your proof and he
[51:01.680 --> 51:06.720]  said i'm just i'm not going to tell you but he said he said let's just say i work in hospitals
[51:06.720 --> 51:10.960]  rewiring jaws of people that are in auto accidents especially when it's my patients because they
[51:10.960 --> 51:16.000]  call me up at 2 a.m and back then he like was like superman he would just get up constantly
[51:16.000 --> 51:18.400]  middle of the night go you know rewire people's jaws and stuff
[51:18.400 --> 51:24.000]  if they were his patients at the hospital he's an oral surgeon too
[51:26.640 --> 51:31.600]  and then i remember like six seven years later at my grandparents house my grandfather in
[51:31.600 --> 51:36.640]  austin we moved to austin by then like to watch 60 minutes before dinner every sunday religiously
[51:38.240 --> 51:43.520]  and they had a whole show about chicago and dallas texas killing people for their organs
[51:43.520 --> 51:49.440]  and they mentioned a couple hospitals in dallas a couple hospitals uh in
[51:51.840 --> 51:57.520]  couple hospitals in chicago and it's come out other hospitals in austin taking organs and
[51:57.520 --> 52:02.080]  killing people and taking their corneas and then they're not really dead and stuff like that
[52:03.920 --> 52:11.920]  it's just something like this human animal chimeras are gestating on research farms
[52:11.920 --> 52:15.760]  and i've got hundreds of articles here i could spend all day on these it's not like i keep going
[52:15.760 --> 52:18.960]  back to this four or five times this last week because i don't have material
[52:21.200 --> 52:24.880]  this is a big whitewash article where it calls it tissue no they're growing
[52:26.000 --> 52:32.560]  embryonic babies that they create embryos and test tubes and then they implant them in the
[52:32.560 --> 52:38.720]  cows and in the sheep and in the pigs because they can't get women to do it and lord knows they've
[52:38.720 --> 52:43.360]  done it with women too that's the word but they want them in cows because they can grow them
[52:43.360 --> 52:52.800]  up bigger and get larger organs 30 years ago 20 years ago i was reporting on this out of
[52:52.800 --> 52:58.640]  light papers and it was 10 years old then that's when they admitted it and look i know i keep
[52:58.640 --> 53:02.560]  belaboring but this is the point i'm getting out of the story i've told probably 50 times
[53:02.560 --> 53:11.600]  of about 14 years ago i went in to pick up a pizza at a pizza place and this guy goes i used
[53:11.600 --> 53:18.560]  to be a listener to you until you lied and said there's sheep and goats that are part spider and
[53:18.560 --> 53:23.920]  that they create body armor in their milk and i said okay well believe whatever you want sir and
[53:23.920 --> 53:31.520]  he poked me in my back and said no you're a liar and i turned around i said so you went to college
[53:31.520 --> 53:41.520]  didn't you it's like yeah i did i went when did you go i went to ut of the 70s and i took biology
[53:42.160 --> 53:43.440]  they don't have stuff like that
[53:47.200 --> 53:53.680]  and i just said you better get out of my face and that's what i deal with folks i'm covering stuff
[53:53.680 --> 54:00.480]  that's spider goats are at least 25 years old they've been in tens of thousands of publications
[54:00.480 --> 54:09.600]  they've been in hundreds of publications at that time i had the ceo on my show running a department
[54:09.600 --> 54:16.240]  of defense program with the goats the month before that guy said i was a liar but see that's
[54:16.240 --> 54:23.200]  what i can't deal with the emergency centers establishment act the civilian inmate labor
[54:23.200 --> 54:32.560]  camp program the all of this is admitted fema camps are admitted it's all admitted in the
[54:32.560 --> 54:38.000]  army times they're preparing them for political dissenters but they just sit up there and say
[54:38.000 --> 54:43.440]  crazy people think this is all happening folks let's get into the economy right now i'm not
[54:43.440 --> 54:48.160]  trying to scare people i'm going over facts to hope to get people to realize it's like if there's a
[54:48.160 --> 54:55.440]  big wildfire coming through the forest and your town's a mile away the fire department starts
[54:55.440 --> 55:00.880]  driving through on loudspeaker saying get out of your house evacuate they've got auto dialer systems
[55:00.880 --> 55:05.360]  from local governments that call you and say a flood's coming a fire is coming they have announcements
[55:05.360 --> 55:09.760]  that are hurricanes coming expected to have you know 10 feet of water come over your town
[55:10.880 --> 55:16.640]  that's not fear mongering when i'm sitting here saying crazy stuff's going on and the genetic
[55:16.640 --> 55:23.760]  engineers i've interviewed top people some of them ran giant programs are saying it's giving rise
[55:23.760 --> 55:30.160]  to super bacteria and super viruses and zoological crossovers of diseases humans couldn't get
[55:30.160 --> 55:35.600]  we're now getting because of things like this i mean department of defense stuff at plum island
[55:35.600 --> 55:45.200]  gave us Lyme's disease that is basically weaponized tick-borne syphilis didn't exist until it got
[55:45.200 --> 55:51.200]  loose in the 60s that's admitted i mean that's an example of what low tech is doing to us
[55:53.440 --> 55:59.440]  now before i go any further again we were telling people
[56:02.160 --> 56:07.360]  two years ago that walmarts were closing because the economy was stalling that's a canary in the
[56:07.360 --> 56:16.080]  coal mile in the coal mine of retail sales the government spun it that we were saying they were
[56:16.080 --> 56:20.400]  martial law bases we never said that and then gullible people repeated it and then that's how
[56:20.400 --> 56:30.080]  they tried to discredit us well now they've closed 269 stores globally 140 something domestically
[56:30.080 --> 56:35.920]  and even more are coming after that and other retail stores are closing all over the country
[56:35.920 --> 56:40.160]  and retail sales and everything else are in the toilet and obama gets up on tv and says

[01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:14.160]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network all right in the next segment i'm going to get into
[01:00:14.160 --> 01:00:20.960]  is the market the beast real and we're going to go to donna sam james michael david donnie
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:28.560]  lenny glenn and many others i see the phones are loaded off 1314 phone lines as they always are but
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:33.040]  some are still ringing we're going to get to those as fast as we can toll free number to join us
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:40.640]  877-789-2539 but before i get into that and then after we get into the whole market the
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:46.000]  beast situation i want to get back into the situation with hillary what's happening with
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:52.480]  the economy and so much more but here's the bottom line there is an attack on humanity
[01:00:53.280 --> 01:00:59.520]  and whether the devil's real or not i want to end debate the political global system of eugenics
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:06.080]  comes to kill steal and destroy and behaves like the mythical devil the archetype is real
[01:01:06.640 --> 01:01:12.240]  joseph cambell the whole nine yards for me there's no debating i know there's a spiritual force
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:19.120]  i've experienced providence i've experienced many things that are private i can tell you it's real
[01:01:19.760 --> 01:01:25.040]  i've interviewed many people i respect like colonel craig roberts who died for 10 minutes
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:31.280]  on the operating table came back there are third world cultures that don't even have a christian
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:38.960]  pantheon uh or cosmology who've also been checked out by government psychiatrists and others who
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:48.240]  became christian and they have found that the christ phenomenon the golden gates all of it the
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:54.960]  portal the judgment all of it is real people say well that's an oxymoron you said
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:02:00.080]  the dead and christ are raised after they die interdimensionally it doesn't matter they're
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:04.240]  already in the future at that point see it's it's more sophisticated once you understand
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:11.120]  quantum mechanics you think a thousand years five hundred years 20 years till the post tribulation
[01:02:11.120 --> 01:02:18.800]  rapture and then people are having the death experience now they're going in dimensionally
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:22.640]  to the future if you study the mathematics it's incredible and then by the way no one's ever
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:27.120]  postulated that i just understand it and people can say oh that's crazy no no no once you figure
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.000]  all this out the sacred geometry people are like that's of the devil no it's not the bible says
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:37.120]  the proof of god's design the proof that god's real is look in the heavens look at god's creation
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:41.680]  look at what we can do what we believe what we think about we can then later build
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:46.320]  that's creator level stuff we're made in the image of god little g
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:54.960]  think about how incredible that is and then think about the evidence in matter but also
[01:02:55.600 --> 01:03:02.320]  living and non-living again how we experience what our ancestors experienced through instincts
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:09.120]  through through crystallized uh compacted memories race memory then we live on through
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:13.760]  our children genetically as well and then what we build what we teach what we write what we do
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:24.960]  lives on there's life shooting out at every angle by the way by the way info wars is doing well
[01:03:26.160 --> 01:03:32.000]  we're not in financial trouble like so much of other talk radio and other media period
[01:03:32.640 --> 01:03:38.880]  media period is oversaturated is collapsing it's in trouble it's stuffed shirt it's scripted
[01:03:38.880 --> 01:03:44.960]  teleprompter reading it's dying we have been trying to expand in the face of the globalist
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:49.520]  because everything we do is so successful i have a responsibility i realized i realized this about

[01:03:53.200 --> 01:04:00.480]  a huge effect we're just victims of our own success because the satellites uh the fees the
[01:04:00.480 --> 01:04:08.320]  regulations the closed captioning the 15 to 16 million people that tune in and watch our free
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:17.680]  stream every day is killing us and so i really want to be able to continue on i want to be able

[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:29.200]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[01:06:32.320 --> 01:06:33.200]  well i've been watching
[01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:36.400]  i've been waiting
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:42.080]  ladies and gentlemen i've been witnessing open world government established
[01:06:42.080 --> 01:06:48.720]  and when you read the bible it talks about a planetary government a one world political system
[01:06:48.720 --> 01:06:54.240]  with a false prophet that points towards the world leader as the savior of the planet
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:07:00.480]  a unified one world religion and now we have the pope calling for a one world religion calling
[01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:07.920]  for global government we see 10 regional kingdoms under the un with subregions of 10 under each
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:13.200]  region notice fema has 10 regions we notice the un documents calling it a kingdom
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:20.400]  you notice that they are announcing that you're going to need a biometric facecan or thumbprint
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:25.840]  in the future to buy or sell all the new microsoft and other major software has the thumbprint
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:31.520]  technology on it i told you 16 17 years ago you would thumbprint to turn your computer on
[01:07:31.520 --> 01:07:38.800]  or your phone on the future soon it won't be something that's an option it'll be mandatory
[01:07:40.560 --> 01:07:47.120]  that is your body let he understanding reckon the number of the beast four to six hundred and
[01:07:47.120 --> 01:07:52.800]  sixty six the number of a man your digital number your measurement of your face the
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.760]  measurement of your palm the measurement of your index finger becomes a digital number
[01:07:57.760 --> 01:08:05.920]  or let he who has understanding reckon the number and the preachers constantly debate
[01:08:05.920 --> 01:08:10.960]  what it is what's going to happen and now that they have major european companies years ago
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:15.680]  making their employees get microchips and the mexican police have to get microchips and your
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:21.680]  pet they're trying to pass laws get the microchip and the nsa spawn everything you do and google
[01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:26.480]  taking all the data and feeding it through these systems and predicting the future and the biggest
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:31.600]  point china comes out last year and says when the next two years we're going to implement it
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:37.120]  is going to be law it started now 2016 that every political statement you make everything you buy
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:44.400]  everything you do will be fed through our database the equivalent of their nsa and will be put into a
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:52.080]  social media score like you can pull that up china announces new social credit score and then if
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:59.120]  you're not a good globalist you can't buy or sell if you do you get lower prices now it's peer pressure
[01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:05.920]  now if your friends aren't good communist you don't get a good social score so now you shun them to
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:13.120]  ghettos there's bbc china social credit Beijing sets up huge system and the bbc announces it like
[01:09:13.120 --> 01:09:19.600]  it's a good idea it's not total tyranny it is exactly what's described in revelations so is the
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:26.400]  mark of the beast real oh it's been used as a blueprint whether or not the cosmology itself is
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:32.160]  true and i'm a christian but i don't want to be associated with the establishment Pharisee
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:40.560]  state-run churches that are 501c3 now even cnn got it right to their credit china's chilling plan
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:46.320]  to use social credit ratings to keep score on its citizens cnn is so weird man they do so much bad
[01:09:46.320 --> 01:09:52.800]  and then sometimes they tell the truth in amazing ways well i'll tell you why it's like rt will talk
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:59.520]  about the bad stuff america does but not bad stuff russia does cnn's run by the cia folks it's all
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:03.360]  you can look it up anderson cooper all of the satellites are government they have this one of
[01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:10.720]  the first cable network and so they're allowed occasionally because our good buddy status with
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.160]  china is kind of going away right now so now you're going to start hearing a little bit of truth
[01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:20.960]  about them harvesting organs doing things like that but the question is why isn't it being covered
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:29.200]  that it's happening here from babies now i'm not saying all atheists are like this but so many of
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:40.240]  them are incredibly closed-minded some of them are just so pro-government the state is god uh and
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:44.400]  of course you know an atheist i agree with who i think is a great intellectual uh when it comes
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:48.320]  to so many points of stuff on malinu and he'll point out that the most dangerous people out there
[01:10:48.320 --> 01:10:53.920]  are the liberal status who tend to be atheist but their new god their brand new god to quote glenn
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:11:07.920]  danzig is the state is the system and that's not a new god at all so all i know is what's in
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:13.520]  revelations is beginning to unfold and whether it's real or whether they use it as a blueprint
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:18.640]  i know it's real but whatever you want to believe fine what are you gonna do about the
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:24.800]  fact that it's manifesting and here's the other issue before i go to james everybody else that's
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:34.800]  holding and here's what i'm getting at i grew up going to southern baptist churches baptist
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:41.120]  churches and evangelical churches and then when i go down to visit grandma in east texas i went to
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:51.760]  the methodist church and i sat there and i watched Protestant churches teach that don't worry about
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:56.960]  trouble in the world don't worry about problems don't worry about the antichrist that's because
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.680]  people could see that stuff in the news because you're going to be raptured out in fact can we
[01:12:01.680 --> 01:12:05.280]  come back from breaker before we go to break and come back with calls so we play it show from
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:10.640]  star trek people being beamed up i just want to show that because jesus didn't get beamed up
[01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:17.440]  of his 12 disciples what all of them but one got killed and they wouldn't recant their faith
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:22.400]  they didn't follow roman's 13 out of context all the prophets got killed or came close
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:27.440]  moses got attacked didn't follow pharaoh's orders violated roman's 13 because he didn't
[01:12:27.440 --> 01:12:34.000]  violate it it says if you have a godly government if it's good do as it says or if it's it's coin
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:40.720]  whose face is on this christ said they wanted to set christ up they said you're gonna pay taxes
[01:12:40.720 --> 01:12:47.120]  you're gonna follow up he goes yeah whose face is that scissors that's that's that's his his face
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:53.920]  is on it it's his system he mined it it's his property that's like saying you take a micro ship
[01:12:53.920 --> 01:13:03.040]  you got to follow their system you've opted in you've contracted i'm not up here judging anybody
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:07.200]  that's in the system i'm in it too but i'm in it to try to educate and try to inform people
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:14.640]  but it's nowhere you can read john the revelator on the isle of patmos the beast will wage war
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:18.480]  against the saints and will overcome them they'll be this great following away before
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:23.280]  it'll be the greatest coming to christ and to god ever as the whole world turns against the beast
[01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:28.080]  more and more and then he starts wiping out billions of people a third of the world's population
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.880]  half the earth's surface burned what could giant columns of flame mountains huge metal
[01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:43.920]  insects dropping bombs i mean it's all in there huge wars russia and the middle east huge
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:54.800]  confrontations it's all being lined up you can't deny it and then christ comes back at the battle
[01:13:54.800 --> 01:14:03.760]  of armageddon and then the dead in christ are raised i mean a five-year-old could read that
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:09.360]  but you're so deceived because the last hundred plus years the world council and national council
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:14.320]  of churches has globalized the christian faith and come in and taught new dogmas that were not
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:20.720]  known in christianity ever in the 40s german christians didn't resist hitler and thought
[01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:24.400]  it was the end of the world they thought he was the antichrist they kept saying when are we gonna
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:31.120]  be rapture when are we gonna be rare it isn't there and listen christians get so mad at me
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.960]  i'm not saying your preacher's wrong if he teaches pre-tribulation rapture i'm not saying
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:42.560]  he's a false teacher i'm sure he knows more bible verses than i do all i know is the whole bible
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:47.200]  christians have to stand up the israelites had to stand up against evil and do the right thing
[01:14:47.200 --> 01:14:53.840]  on threat of death and many times get killed why now do we get teleported up like let's show captain
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:15:01.840]  kirk being teleported i mean i want to understand this because my gut my spirit tells me it's not
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:08.880]  right and regardless let's say there's a pre-tribulation rapture what he's going to do now
[01:15:08.880 --> 01:15:14.080]  against abortion or the baby parts selling or all the corruption or all because all i hear christians
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:19.760]  saying is praise god it's getting so bad that means jesus will be around the corner come jesus
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:26.240]  come jesus come jesus come jesus i mean imagine the george washington who's praying for providence
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:31.280]  and god's support would have said oh jesus come back teleport me out of here the british you're here
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:34.720]  it's the devil king george the third's the antichrist what am i going to do
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:42.960]  so is the mark of the beast real what are christians going to do that don't get teleported out as the
[01:15:42.960 --> 01:15:48.480]  world leader shows up the cashless society all of its unfolding and scriptures being fulfilled
[01:15:48.480 --> 01:15:54.080]  they're like i'm still waiting to be teleported out now preachers are saying you can take the chip
[01:15:54.080 --> 01:16:00.880]  and do what the government says when cells become toxic they die early and aging sets in no one

[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.240]  now i want to be clear about something when it comes to the private federal reserve i'm an expert
[01:20:20.240 --> 01:20:26.160]  when it comes to tracking the globalist what they're doing through medical
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:33.120]  tyranny i am very well informed when i get up here and talk about the tribulation and post
[01:20:36.400 --> 01:20:41.120]  tribulation doctrines or pre-tribulation doctrines or mid-tribulation i'm not attacking
[01:20:41.120 --> 01:20:45.600]  anybody if you disagree with me if you're a christian if you're an atheist if you think it happens
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:52.640]  after or before it's okay to have debates people get so angry when i say there's god or say there's
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:58.240]  the devil the atheists all get upset or if i get up here and talk about man looks like the mark of
[01:20:58.240 --> 01:21:03.200]  the beast is pretty much getting here i've got all these stacks of news about casual societies and
[01:21:03.200 --> 01:21:07.200]  how they're going to screw us over with it even if you were an atheist you shouldn't want a casual
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:14.000]  society of total surveillance total control look at how they can game these digital systems with
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:20.080]  the interest rates and the stock markets and the currencies and you know bank of america trying to
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:25.040]  charge you five dollars every time you use your card remember that i mean this is a bad idea and
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:32.480]  the bible says it's the worst idea and it's when you know the devil is upon you wow that's a 2000
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:41.280]  plus year old book and i'm really into it i mean we don't know all the mysteries of this world's
[01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.960]  what i'm getting at people go well those are studied by the masons and those are studied by
[01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:50.800]  the egyptians and by the occultist and you know so uh what are you doing talking about it because
[01:21:50.800 --> 01:21:56.000]  the original christians were all into that folks and then that all got walled off so that we never
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:02.560]  got the information and i'm here really trying to have a debate about all this stuff not be some
[01:22:02.560 --> 01:22:07.840]  Pharisee saying i've got all the answers now i i'm gonna stop now because i've got 1314 phone
[01:22:07.840 --> 01:22:14.000]  calls donna sam james michael david donnie eddie mark lennie sue glenn i will go to every caller
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.120]  in the next three segments we're gonna do it right now so
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:22.960]  use this all there is this third dimension mathematics show it isn't
[01:22:25.680 --> 01:22:30.640]  where do we come from are you worried about the mark of the beast
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:36.720]  or do you just think none of it's real or maybe if something bad happens we'll just be
[01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:42.080]  teleported out let me just say this i hope that if the antichrist shows up and starts carrying out
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:49.600]  all this tyranny but first has all these medical miracles to save people and help them and for
[01:22:49.600 --> 01:22:58.000]  the first couple years and we make them world leader man i tell you the revelations reads like
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:04.080]  childhoods end or i should say childhoods in reads like revelations you got four or five years
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:07.440]  everything being wonderful all these miracles and everybody's worshiping the antichrist and
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:09.760]  he makes you bow down and worship him and if you don't he kills you
[01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:17.600]  i hope none of that's true i'll tell you that right now but let me tell you i see the whole
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:26.320]  world lining up to fulfill this and i go to church after church don't hear a word about it
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:34.800]  i hear praise jesus things is so bad that means jesus is coming back real soon well i
[01:23:34.800 --> 01:23:39.440]  don't think jesus is coming back for people that hit out in their church and didn't go out and do
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:46.080]  anything and stand up against this those people sound like collaborators to me
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:52.000]  and i'm not on some high horse but if i get lectured one more time
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:58.240]  i'm by Pharisee about me getting mad sometimes and using mild french which i try not to do but
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:03.440]  i'm so real i do it occasionally i'm going to throw up get the beam out of your eye before
[01:24:03.440 --> 01:24:08.800]  you talk about the stick in my eye i'm ready to die for the unborn i'm ready to stand up against
[01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:15.120]  the globalist i'm nothing special but i don't like evil i know my heart's right where's yours
[01:24:15.120 --> 01:24:20.000]  because i don't see the manifestation of resistance against tyranny i see people in a coma
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:25.920]  who want to go to church and look like they're all upright and good and at night we know what
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:32.000]  you're doing i almost want to go do bad stuff so i'm not with you all the fakes i'm wracked by
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.960]  conscience i'm wracked by trying to be the best person i can be and even having to study the
[01:24:36.960 --> 01:24:41.680]  globalists in wargame they're evil i have to get in their mindset and i feel sinful even
[01:24:41.680 --> 01:24:48.480]  studying the enemy the knowledge of good and evil permeates all i just know that great evil is
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:53.200]  upon us and it's only going to intensify for the decades coming forward it may be 50 years 100
[01:24:53.200 --> 01:24:59.520]  years out my gut tells me it's more like 10 years i mean stuff is moving quick folks and it's scary
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.440]  but like neneva we could get a reprieve god was going to judge neneva
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.840]  but because jonah didn't want to go jonah didn't want to be a prophet jonah didn't want to go out
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.840]  and tell the truth jonah didn't want to get in people's faces but because jonah did it the people
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:22.400]  listened they got a hundred year reprieve from the volcanoes and earthquakes that destroy that
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:30.000]  civilization and archaeology shows it happened and let me tell you if we can get a hundred year
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:35.680]  reprieve that's great that's another thing we push back to evil you pray you take action you get
[01:25:35.680 --> 01:25:39.920]  involved we push it back we hold back world government we hold back force inoculation
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:44.960]  we hold back sexualization of five-year-olds and people say where is it it isn't coming where's
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:51.280]  the tyranny and finally though the walls are failing the shields are going down liberty's
[01:25:51.280 --> 01:25:54.960]  failing all over the world evil's coming in people are going to go wait a minute it's real
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:58.080]  wow hey look do more to fight it see how that works
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:05.520]  and global depression is already raging all over the world
[01:26:07.680 --> 01:26:11.440]  and when it gets here with this spoiled rotten population katie bar the door let's start going
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:16.320]  to the calls thank you for holding james in noxville tennessee what is your take on this
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.840]  hey brother alex uh first and foremost man i i want to say thank you so much for being a
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:28.400]  watchman in the wild and and being that voice that we need to to help lead us man um i really
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:35.760]  appreciate employers i really appreciate your entire crew uh for me you know i've watched
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:41.760]  after the tribulation the the video that you had something to do with and i agree 100 percent we are
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:47.680]  not going to be raptured out of here we're not going to be magically teleported out uh price
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:52.400]  is not coming back until immediately after the tribulation if you look at what he says and that
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:59.600]  he's 24 that's his exact word um so for me you know i don't know exactly what's going to happen
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:03.680]  with the tribulation i don't know what to expect i know the market the beast is real i know everything
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:08.800]  that you've preached about today is absolutely real um all i know is i'm going to put my faith
[01:27:08.800 --> 01:27:13.920]  in my trust in god and the lord jesus christ that's all i can do my family's can be fine
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:18.880]  as long as i lean on him and trust in him absolutely and imagine when it gets this dark
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:22.560]  all these christian lights are going to be so bright it's why the antichrist want to stuff them out
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:29.840]  and again when you look at how the system does everything it can it's scary to think all this
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:33.920]  is happening so of course people don't want to hear this doctrine that we have to go through
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:38.320]  this but that's what makes us great it's what tests us god bless you good to hear from you
[01:27:40.480 --> 01:27:53.280]  again i i once heard of saying pray for post i mean pray for pre prepare for post pray for pre
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:28:02.720]  prepare for post and all i know is there's tribulations all the time the bible is so
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:08.880]  incredible it talks about many antichrists with antichrist spirits building towards the final
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:16.080]  antichrists antichrist spirit kill steal and destroy we're gonna break and i'm gonna come
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.680]  back and just race through calls i promise for two more seconds i'm gonna get to everybody uh

[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:32.320]  welcome back ladies and gentlemen i'm going to write to your phone calls is the market the beast
[01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:40.880]  real well a global system to make you biometrically scan or swipe a card to travel to purchase food to
[01:33:40.880 --> 01:33:47.760]  work is here so regardless of whether it's real biblically or not it's now manifesting and it's
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:52.800]  very oppressive and the churches won't talk about it won't discuss it because they're too busy
[01:33:52.800 --> 01:33:56.640]  telling everybody they're going to be raptured out of it that's the Protestant churches the
[01:33:56.640 --> 01:34:01.440]  Catholic church is too busy saying embrace it world government open your borders one world
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:08.080]  religions i mean we're in a lot of trouble and all i know is what the bible teaches is not being
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:14.240]  taught in most these churches what's being taught is state runs totalitarianism donna in new hampshire
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:19.120]  thank you for holding her on the air thank you for taking my call well first of all i don't believe
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:23.920]  the market the beast is going to be any kind of microchip what it's going to be is whether or not
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:31.600]  your obedience and the frontal lobe of our brain is where we make our decisions and that's going to
[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:38.480]  be whether you're going to obey the the beast system or you're not and i i truly believe
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:44.400]  that um that people have uh will have a connection there'll be two sets of people at that point in
[01:34:44.400 --> 01:34:50.960]  time there'll be those that obey the market of these and those that don't and remember jesus
[01:34:50.960 --> 01:34:56.960]  said in mark 1320 that he has shortened the time so the time of the antichrist is only going to be
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:35:02.320]  your five months because if you didn't there'd be no flesh spared exactly and that's why if you
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:10.160]  don't stop that gold silver guns ammo your food if you can just hunt her down for five months
[01:35:10.160 --> 01:35:16.240]  you're going to beat the system and that's how it works absolutely but so the devil comes in
[01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:21.040]  takes over the churches i'm not blaming mason's but it was a masonic group did it teaches oh no
[01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:24.640]  you're going to be raptured don't worry so you're a sitting duck when it all happens notice everything
[01:35:24.640 --> 01:35:29.120]  the globalist do is about getting you dependent making sure you don't have storable food making
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:34.160]  sure you're not prepared making sure you're not self-sufficient getting you on welfare everything
[01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:40.080]  because they need you to opt in with your free will and accept the mark of the beast which are you
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:46.800]  saying is a frontal lobe brain chip uh no i what i what i'm saying is is that we have to use our
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:50.960]  frontal lobes to make decisions no but i mean i i mean i tend to think it is finally a brain
[01:35:50.960 --> 01:35:57.360]  chip it's nano tech injected they already have it where you agree to take a nano nano injection
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:36:03.200]  quote anti-stress vaccine that actually permanently alters your brain and makes you submit and destroys
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:07.680]  the spiritual connection center in your pineal they actually have that they've been giving it to
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:12.640]  trips for a decade secretly it was declassified last year oh and not to mention the fact that
[01:36:12.640 --> 01:36:17.120]  they're they've been pumping fluoride in our systems for very long all of it but i mean i agree
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:23.680]  that it's a beast system but it is cashless it is a mark biometrically scanned to buy or sell
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:29.680]  but you must opt into it and there it is DARPA researchers build dissolvable medical electronics
[01:36:29.680 --> 01:36:35.040]  so that's uh out of pc world thank you so much for the call donna uh let's go ahead and talk to
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:42.160]  michael in ontario uh ontario oregon i guess go ahead you're on the air yeah i would say how you're
[01:36:42.160 --> 01:36:47.280]  doing welcome i'm a long time listener but listen to you about eight years and you know you really
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:52.400]  do a good job here putting this stuff out but my friend i would like to caution you to now you're
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:37:00.480]  getting into a ground where uh you know i know you would not intentionally mislead people because
[01:37:00.480 --> 01:37:04.960]  i've listened to you talk about the documentation and stuff but when we get down to the mark of the
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:12.000]  beast it is absolutely real but the thing is is what is the beast and you need to do a study
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:18.800]  both of the book at daniel and revelations because in in prophecy a beast is a kingdom or a power
[01:37:19.360 --> 01:37:24.560]  and i agree it's the mark of the world government and the one world leader in his false prophet and
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:30.640]  the beast system obviously i said at the beginning i know it's real i believe in the mark of the beast
[01:37:30.640 --> 01:37:35.280]  i asked the question to you the listeners do you think it's real as part of the debate
[01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:41.200]  yes i do believe it's real and the thing is is that the beast could be identified because
[01:37:41.200 --> 01:37:47.440]  for number one it's it's a it's a it's a power it's a state it's a a government place power
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:54.800]  yes it is a financial power it is also a religious and it says it all just folks read revelation for
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:38:00.080]  yourself read daniel read Ezekiel they all tie together uh my grandfather my mom's dad was so
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:05.120]  smart and he would sit there and say son he said to the bible like five hours a day he was a great
[01:38:05.120 --> 01:38:09.520]  guy world war two vet you name and he would say the devil's getting us through prosperity it's a
[01:38:09.520 --> 01:38:14.480]  false prosperity it's a trojan horse they're getting everybody dependent the system he would talk
[01:38:14.480 --> 01:38:21.120]  about it constantly because he could see it and now it's it's so clear that they're trying to put us
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:26.960]  into a false reality it's just amazing yeah and you know you you make you made a remark here why
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:32.400]  don't you hear this preached in the in the churches those days you know and i'll tell you what you'll
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:40.000]  not hear this because in 2014 at the global summit there in soul south korea went 80 major
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:48.400]  religious leaders from all from jane is buddhism hinduism judy is cento all of it all of them got
[01:38:48.400 --> 01:38:55.200]  together and signed a pledge to get the un to that they would try to use their influence to get you
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:39:00.960]  in to pass a one world religion that you can do anything you want you can't criticize another one
[01:39:00.960 --> 01:39:05.200]  and you have to basically accept it that is directly out of the bible and now we have the pope
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:12.000]  openly calling for a one world religion i mean that is a prophecy being fulfilled absolutely
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.320]  and i'm not bashing catholics folks it's just a fact and everybody knows that catholics are
[01:39:16.320 --> 01:39:22.880]  freaking out but the Protestant churches are just as bad it is crazy and it is it is so dangerous
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:27.760]  god bless you i appreciate your call donnie in west virginia you're on the air thank you for holding
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:32.720]  me thank you alex i just want to let you know that yeah i've been uh supporting info war is
[01:39:32.720 --> 01:39:37.040]  all i can i you know i'm at work and i'm trying to share this knowledge with everybody and you
[01:39:37.040 --> 01:39:42.480]  got guys that i actually had a guy ask me at the new world order and he was being dead serious
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:48.080]  if i was referring to the wrestling the wwe wrestling duo um i mean i was flabbergasted
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:53.280]  when he said that uh i mean because we see it all around us golden sacks bill delberg i mean
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:58.320]  these are all systems dfr uh trial out commission they're all systems of the new world order
[01:39:58.320 --> 01:40:04.080]  coming together um but also yeah the market of peace i do i think it's it's going to be a physical
[01:40:04.080 --> 01:40:08.720]  and it's going to be a mental thing like you have the absence of the knowledge of god in your heart
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:15.600]  as well as your mind um simultaneously with taking a physical mark be it a microchip uh a barcode
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:20.320]  whatever uh in your hand or in your forehead i mean because it does say what it is is pledging
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:26.080]  allegiance to the private world government to the private federal reserve to what it's doing
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:30.480]  because that system is going to be murdering and enslaving the third world en masse it's going to
[01:40:30.480 --> 01:40:36.560]  be the first world pledging allegiance to the extermination of 80 of the world population
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:41.440]  in the un plan god's not going to put up with it and no one else gets into this i wish i wasn't the
[01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:46.960]  only person it's dangerous i i basically have studied it and i basically have nightmares about it
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:51.440]  and i'm getting ready to just start laying it all out folks but let me tell you europe and the united
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:56.000]  states in places are going to be quasi protected we're going to take the mark we're going to go
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.920]  along with it and the and the globalists are going to release bio weapons you name it they're
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:05.600]  going to wipe out the third world we're going to basically take the biometric genetically engineered
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.720]  injections that protect us but that basically give up our free will and pledge allegiance
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:15.600]  to survive the plagues uh that are brought upon the earth i've looked at their whole plan
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.240]  and it's satanically inspired i mean i've really studied it you know we've got god inspiring us they
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:25.440]  got the devil inspiring them and all i can tell folks is get ready and hold on to your hat because
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:31.600]  all these elites are working to survive what they think's coming they think they're doing an emergency
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:36.160]  surgery on the earth to save it but in truth you look at everything they're doing they're killing
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:40.800]  it it is it folks just don't be bored out there people that's if you're tuning into mainstream
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:45.120]  media you're bored because that's a false reality you feel like it's not fulfilling because it's

[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:15.840]  that folks say what fema region they're in i'm in fema region six formerly texas but our governor
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:19.840]  knows that now speaking out against it that's the good news uh sam you're on the air welcome
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:24.960]  welcome there thank you alex i just wanted to call in and say yes the mark of the beast is
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:29.680]  absolutely going to be real and you'd have to be blind not to see the prophecy is coming
[01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:35.920]  it's all being manifest isn't it it's incredible my question to you is when do we stand up i mean
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:41.440]  i i sign the petitions i stock the beans in the bullets i follow you you're my general george
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:46.640]  washington i listen to you daily and i get my information i pass it i spread it but when is
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:53.280]  the red line when do we stand up and actually gather together and put an end to this is it when the
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.520]  mark of the beast comes and they force us to honest or is it yes sir they're going to bring in a
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:01.760]  global financial collapse this may be a smaller one that's about to happen to get us ready for it
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:06.400]  but then they issue the id cards they make you biometrically scan to buy and sell they say for
[01:49:06.400 --> 01:49:10.400]  security reasons you've got to do it they start arresting people that aren't part of it they
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:16.320]  start rounding up people in ghettos and communities that don't go along with it they start saying
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:20.800]  christians or terrorists which they're already saying in the homeland security directives they
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:26.000]  start bringing in radical islamists to attack us you see the early stages of what they're planning
[01:49:26.000 --> 01:49:32.560]  and who they are and you fight as hard as you can to get the info out informational warfare wise
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:37.360]  so that when it actually goes physical we've got the maximum number of people that are informed
[01:49:37.360 --> 01:49:41.520]  and involved and awake to what's happening i mean the question you ask is the key question
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:48.720]  but i think so much of this is what the earlier callers said biblically we're not meant to go on
[01:49:48.720 --> 01:49:53.520]  an offensive against this if you actually follow the bible we're meant to try to stay out of the way
[01:49:53.520 --> 01:50:00.320]  hunker down be in rural areas it's it's only going to go for less than a year there'll be huge growth
[01:50:00.320 --> 01:50:07.680]  pains and and birth pains up to the line uh and and lots of lower level manifestations of the evil
[01:50:08.400 --> 01:50:11.920]  you know tens of millions dying car wrecks over your worldwide i mean is that a holocaust is
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:16.960]  at the antichrist no it's part of life but you could see them building towards uh this future
[01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:22.480]  dehumanization system the key is don't let your family fall into the delusion of the virtual
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:28.560]  reality the tv the drugs the wires they're going to plug directly into your brain that's the mark
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:36.720]  of the beast is giving over your consciousness the antichrist is spiritually us giving over our
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:43.440]  will to the system and then raising a world leader up who is the antichrist but the antichrist itself
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:49.840]  is the beast system that we absorb into and plug into like google google executives when
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:53.840]  they were founded 17 years ago they had caught people there and the government was there it was
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:58.000]  a wired magazine had an article on it last year i've been told about this by executives but never
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.680]  seen it in the news i'd already told people on air and nico came and said you've been saying this
[01:51:01.680 --> 01:51:05.280]  for the four years i've worked here three years i've worked here and he handed me the big wired
[01:51:05.280 --> 01:51:09.440]  article where they were meeting they released the minutes of their first meeting and they said
[01:51:09.440 --> 01:51:14.400]  gentlemen we're not building a search engine we're building a system that controls reality
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:19.680]  once we can predict the future we can steer the future we already have the technology we'll build
[01:51:19.680 --> 01:51:26.000]  the new brain and it'll actually be a neuro hive plugging in billions of people into a network
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:32.560]  with each other the truth is it's human driven the artificial intelligence is a billion plus people
[01:51:32.560 --> 01:51:39.840]  in live time interface with a computer now that is not officially intelligence i don't know what is
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:44.240]  talk about putting your minds together what god says is what two of you and on earth agree to
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:48.800]  i'll be made done in heaven what about a billion of you agree to it one time let's put the wired
[01:51:48.800 --> 01:51:56.720]  magazine article back up google just open source tensor flow it's artificial intelligence engine
[01:51:57.520 --> 01:52:02.320]  and they've already released it so i'm telling you folks you're not in kansas anymore
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:13.040]  i mean this is hardcore and they're doing it and let me tell you the entity the spirit the will
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:20.000]  believe the devil or not the folks running this don't have your good intentions they're not nice
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.600]  people they don't have good will they're bad they hate you and they've got the will to build this
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:31.680]  because they want power and if men keep sitting around watching the nfl playoffs they're going
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:37.360]  to beat us but they're not going to turn off all the fun entertainment until they're ready to carve
[01:52:37.360 --> 01:52:45.840]  you up you're going to be so in transfix watching nfl and taking drugs and synthetic wire head plug
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:51.520]  in virtual reality that when they come and you're dying of 14 different cancers you'll just say
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:56.480]  they'll say please sign the form for your next welfare check for your family and we'll give you
[01:52:56.480 --> 01:53:01.520]  the dose that frees your mind you'll say give me that shot and that robot's going to jam a lethal
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:08.000]  injection in your arm and pow you're gone you're gonna ask them to kill you because it's all just
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:13.600]  a dream isn't it none of it's real you're so whacked out you didn't see how you got taken over
[01:53:13.600 --> 01:53:19.520]  by an alien force from another dimension the bible tells us about it and gave us a transmission
[01:53:19.520 --> 01:53:25.600]  through humans to be warned about what was coming i'm living in a science fiction movie and it's all
[01:53:25.600 --> 01:53:34.400]  real unbelievable thank you sam let's go to uh who's up next glennon kinetica thanks for holding
[01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:43.440]  her on the air hi alex um i want to read you a passage from revelation 218 please um from
[01:53:43.440 --> 01:53:48.800]  new living translation but cowards unbelievers the corrupt murderers the immoral those who
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:53.920]  practice witchcraft idol worshipers and all liars their fate is in the fiery lake of burning
[01:53:53.920 --> 01:53:58.560]  sulfur this is the second death basically if you don't get involved and you're a coward
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:04.560]  you're going to suffer that's right cowards die a thousand deaths absolutely and and this whole
[01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:12.160]  pre-trib revelation thing is written for people to put everybody to sleep go ahead also um i sent
[01:54:12.160 --> 01:54:19.840]  you a um info wars tip about political correctness basically tomorrows martin luther king day and
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:25.120]  there's real discrimination going on a native american reservation but they can do it because
[01:54:25.120 --> 01:54:30.560]  they're their own sovereign nation but if you were to do it you would get sued so i sent you some
[01:54:30.560 --> 01:54:37.200]  um info wars show tips on that absolutely you know people think just because the the reservations
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:41.120]  are supposedly run by independent groups they're going to be these panaceas of happiness these
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:48.400]  utopias many of them are some of the most corrupt hellish places you can imagine and it's so sad
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:53.200]  uh what's been done there and the model used on native americans was then used by hitler
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:58.080]  with his concentration camps that's a fact just look up hitler modeled his concentration camps
[01:54:58.080 --> 01:55:02.560]  after british native american facilities and then we modeled after british as well not even
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:07.760]  as the british it's just a fact historical fact thank you very much god bless you uh let's go
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:14.320]  ahead and take another call now let's talk to todd in north carolina todd you're on the year uh thank
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:20.720]  you alex i'll make this quick uh there are many panaceas of scripture that totally refute the
[01:55:20.720 --> 01:55:26.480]  pre-tribulation raptor dodger and i want to bring up two of them quickly one is from the gospel
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:33.440]  according to john and also from revelation uh in john chapter 17 in his high priestly prayer
[01:55:33.440 --> 01:55:39.280]  jesus prays for his disciples and for those who believe on him uh that they would not that the
[01:55:39.280 --> 01:55:45.360]  lord that the father would not take them out of the world but keep them from the evil of the world
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:52.000]  and you compare that with uh revelation chapter three exactly god always tries to keep his
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:58.160]  prophets in the world to fight the evil sorry go ahead okay i'll just compare that with the
[01:55:58.160 --> 01:56:04.320]  revelation chapter three uh the the church in philadelphia is told that they will be that he
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:09.280]  but they would be captured i say from the hour of temptation that's will come upon all the world
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:18.240]  it's using the very same phrasing i will keep me from just like in john chapter 17 and so it's
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:24.480]  believe me alex is like that i'm so glad that last year and this year would have the after the
[01:56:24.480 --> 01:56:32.080]  tribulation dbd to come out and then uh the left behind or led astray said i mean you've got the
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:38.640]  scriptural and the historical evidence to totally blast free treatment out of the water and i totally
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:43.920]  agree with what rig wilde said here a little while back he believes were probably within five years or
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:50.160]  so that circumstances in the world will totally destroy the doctrine absolutely because you're
[01:56:50.160 --> 01:56:57.040]  going to see everything manifest open world government world leaders buy or sell chips and
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:01.040]  then what are we going to do i mean you're going to like why am i still here i'm supposed to be out
