[00:35.740 --> 00:42.660]  infowars.com we picked it up from a link off the Drudge report shock photo TSA
[00:42.660 --> 00:48.420]  looking for poop bombs land of the free home of the brave there is a one-year-old
[00:48.420 --> 00:56.340]  baby with the TSA picking the child up off the ground with the TSA agent looking
[00:56.340 --> 01:03.660]  in the diaper and these are the type of photos that pour out from slave training
[01:03.660 --> 01:08.460]  facilities all over the country because if you'll let them stick their hands
[01:08.460 --> 01:13.620]  down your pants and grow up your small child you'll put up with anything these
[01:13.620 --> 01:19.980]  federal gun forces do to you but there is the image the picture that tells a

[01:25.100 --> 01:28.740]  uniforms line you up and grope you this has always been the plan how do you
[01:28.740 --> 01:34.540]  take a free society and completely break their will and break their comfort
[01:34.540 --> 01:38.220]  zone and set the pressure to do whatever you want whenever you want
[01:38.220 --> 01:43.300]  something the Nazis didn't even do until they got you to the camp and the
[01:43.300 --> 01:47.460]  answer is you set up certain reservations where there are no liberties
[01:47.460 --> 01:52.580]  or freedoms doesn't matter if state lawmakers doesn't matter if district
[01:52.580 --> 01:56.980]  attorneys have pointed out what's happening to this child is illegal when
[01:56.980 --> 02:00.140]  they grow up your wife's breast it's illegal and they stick their hands down
[02:00.140 --> 02:04.100]  your pants it's illegal when they grab Ron Paul's genitals or Jesse Ventura's
[02:04.100 --> 02:11.820]  genitals it's illegal they don't care they just do it just like I tried to go
[02:11.820 --> 02:17.100]  deep-sea fishing Saturday morning at a place I've been you know getting guides
[02:17.100 --> 02:24.940]  out of for decades decades 20 years or more and now the state of Texas to
[02:24.940 --> 02:30.020]  manage your social security number when you buy a fishing license or any other
[02:30.020 --> 02:33.620]  license of course there's federal and state law they can't use that for an
[02:33.620 --> 02:43.580]  identification but the sign said no social security no no fishing and then
[02:43.580 --> 02:47.140]  the lady said well the truth is the illegal aliens just use fake ones and
[02:47.140 --> 02:54.900]  the systems is set up where any number works they just they just want law
[02:54.900 --> 02:57.860]  abiding people's numbers then they went on I said notice you're getting rid of
[02:57.860 --> 03:02.020]  all your old deep sea boats and getting smaller when she said yeah I was already
[03:02.020 --> 03:06.580]  aware of this intellectually but just to see it come home to some place I've
[03:06.580 --> 03:12.340]  been fishing for 20 years they said I was just going bay fishing they said the
[03:12.340 --> 03:17.180]  Feds don't let us catch any fish anymore out past the nine-mile limit and they
[03:17.180 --> 03:22.540]  claim 200 miles is their economic zone but the big giant foreign trawlers they
[03:22.540 --> 03:26.820]  can fish unlimited ragnets on the bottom whatever they want but little
[03:26.820 --> 03:30.500]  fishermen and little guides they're just not even allowed to fish out there
[03:30.500 --> 03:34.700]  anymore and when I was down in Mexico a year ago I noticed there were no more
[03:34.700 --> 03:41.380]  fishing boats down in Cozumel and then they've I talked to the people you know
[03:41.380 --> 03:45.780]  that were renting snorkels and dive gear and they said yeah no under under
[03:45.780 --> 03:49.700]  international agreements only the big ships are allowed to fish now and it
[03:49.700 --> 03:52.420]  said that they're on the edge of rebellion well I went and searched it in
[03:52.420 --> 03:56.820]  the news and found out that all over both coast of Mexico they basically banned
[03:56.820 --> 04:00.780]  all small fishing you're a little guy with your boat running out you pay all
[04:00.780 --> 04:05.760]  the licensing fees everything they say I can catch one fish or you can catch no
[04:05.760 --> 04:09.540]  fish and they're just all out of business and the big giant trawlers are
[04:09.540 --> 04:13.740]  out there doing whatever they want then I went next door after I caught some red
[04:13.740 --> 04:22.100]  fish and really delicious speckled trout got to see dolphins hunting up in
[04:22.100 --> 04:27.580]  the shallows circling around fish it was this great great trip down there with

[12:11.820 --> 12:20.180]  you know what's frustrating what's frustrating is living this studying this
[12:20.180 --> 12:23.660]  constantly from the time I wake up in the morning of the time I got to bed at
[12:23.660 --> 12:32.500]  night doing research and having a long-term memory and and knowing it's a
[12:32.500 --> 12:37.220]  public fact that if some have been laden was and his CIA that's an admitted
[12:37.220 --> 12:44.460]  fact that he was protected that he's a fake boogeyman that countless
[12:44.460 --> 12:48.620]  intelligence professionals and leaders of major governments have said he was
[12:48.620 --> 13:01.100]  dead died of kidney failure and to see them re invoke him to not in the war on
[13:01.100 --> 13:12.140]  terror in these wars but prepared the case to attack Pakistan and to roll out
[13:12.140 --> 13:16.780]  what they've already been preparing in the shadows and beta testing in Tennessee
[13:16.780 --> 13:21.780]  and California and Massachusetts and Florida and Texas Indiana Illinois
[13:21.780 --> 13:29.220]  everywhere warrantless homeland security multi-jurisdictional state police
[13:29.220 --> 13:35.740]  under them regular Army Marine Corps Marine Corps Reserve Army Reserve Air Force
[13:35.740 --> 13:41.700]  MPs you just pull up with your family and there's a giant checkpoint with the
[13:41.700 --> 13:46.300]  military pulling you out of your car searching you huge x-ray machines they
[13:46.300 --> 13:51.260]  drive you under call up the Fox News piece from last year they brag 2000 plus
[13:51.260 --> 13:56.740]  arrest the National Guard comes out under TSA training sets up checkpoints in
[13:56.740 --> 14:02.620]  the middle of New York not the border middle of New York and just starts
[14:02.620 --> 14:07.420]  having families drive under huge x-ray machines with the military standing
[14:07.420 --> 14:11.700]  out right underneath the x-rays and it's bad for the families very bad those
[14:11.700 --> 14:16.060]  things are much more powerful than just x-rays you've got radiologist on that
[14:16.060 --> 14:21.380]  say at least 10 times that's conservative and and the military just
[14:21.380 --> 14:26.380]  stands there under it it is a mass insanity but if they can sell you that
[14:26.380 --> 14:30.460]  50 million aborted babies aren't humans and that it's a good liberal thing to do
[14:30.460 --> 14:35.140]  if they can sell you on a million dead Iraq he's being cool and being fine if
[14:35.140 --> 14:39.180]  they can sell you on open borders and the attempted amnesty of the illegal
[14:39.180 --> 14:47.460]  aliens is is is reasonable if they could sell you on that they could sell you on
[14:47.460 --> 14:53.660]  anything and and this is a population that has been fed so many lies for so
[14:53.660 --> 14:59.260]  long that they think lies are good and reasonable and if you have any common
[14:59.260 --> 15:04.300]  sense you're the bad guy if you have any contextual memory you're the bad guy if
[15:04.300 --> 15:09.380]  you have any historical understanding you're the bad guy knowledge is a bad
[15:09.380 --> 15:17.620]  thing being upright and informed is an evil in this land of madness now that's
[15:17.620 --> 15:21.500]  one group of the population and their controllers and government and the
[15:21.500 --> 15:26.820]  fortune 100 but if you look at the wide spectrum of the population more and more
[15:26.820 --> 15:30.380]  people are beginning to be skeptical they're beginning to question and they
[15:30.380 --> 15:34.140]  know something's wrong and I've told you since last Tuesday or so monitoring
[15:34.140 --> 15:39.180]  talk radio I monitored this weekend and I monitored any shows where people could
[15:39.180 --> 15:42.460]  call in last night driving home from the beach
[15:42.460 --> 15:46.340]  Port Arangas I listened to two hours of Beyond the Beltway and a bunch of other
[15:46.340 --> 15:50.860]  shows that about half the callers that they weren't screening out were look I
[15:50.860 --> 15:54.980]  was in the Marine Corps I've been in a SWAT team for 30 years retired let me
[15:54.980 --> 15:59.020]  tell you when we stack up outside a house we write reports after it we don't
[15:59.020 --> 16:03.220]  get all the stuff wrong and I don't and and then he went through how this was all
[16:03.220 --> 16:07.140]  a fraud and wasn't true and how they'd said bin Laden fought back and then it
[16:07.140 --> 16:10.380]  wasn't true and how they didn't believe it another woman called in and didn't
[16:10.380 --> 16:15.220]  believe it another caller and and and what's happening is people aren't buying
[16:15.220 --> 16:20.820]  the lies anymore a larger and larger minority is really awake and then
[16:20.820 --> 16:24.940]  there's another group that's somewhat awake and then you've got this massive
[16:24.940 --> 16:30.500]  people but I'd say now they're less than half who would buy anything they were
[16:30.500 --> 16:34.980]  told by the media and the government but remember
[16:34.980 --> 16:39.820]  Obama came out and said we're safer eight days ago on that Sunday night two
[16:39.820 --> 16:47.140]  Sundays ago now he came out and he said we're safer and then they instantly said
[16:47.140 --> 16:50.720]  no you're not safer and we came out Monday and said they're gonna hype the
[16:50.720 --> 16:54.660]  living-day lights out of this and prepare you for new terror attacks and by
[16:54.660 --> 16:59.780]  Tuesday that was the story oh my gosh we got the cash of info they want to give
[16:59.780 --> 17:05.580]  the Pakistani government wants to give al-Qaeda radioactive material for dirty
[17:05.580 --> 17:09.860]  bombs or nukes what did the CIA operative get caught three four weeks
[17:09.860 --> 17:17.380]  ago trying to give Taliban affiliated groups uranium so you got that whole
[17:17.380 --> 17:23.660]  setup going and there came out and they said Al Qaeda is gonna blow up the
[17:23.660 --> 17:29.220]  trains Al Qaeda is gonna blow up the malls Al Qaeda is going to blow up the
[17:29.220 --> 17:34.140]  highways now you have to understand there are hundreds of thousands of miles
[17:34.140 --> 17:44.100]  of rail there are it's got to be a million miles guys look up how many miles of
[17:44.100 --> 17:49.180]  major roadway there is in the u.s. how many miles of paved road in u.s. it's
[17:49.180 --> 17:53.180]  got to be in the millions and they're having you believe and Chucky Schumer's
[17:53.180 --> 17:59.340]  out today that they're going to be everywhere because because again Al Qaeda
[17:59.340 --> 18:03.620]  if you believe in these boogeymen guys driving around with turbines on their
[18:03.620 --> 18:10.380]  heads and big beards in full-length gowns or their their minions are gonna
[18:10.380 --> 18:14.100]  attack shopping malls and Walmart's that's why the telescreens were
[18:14.100 --> 18:17.300]  conveniently going in months ago ahead of this you can see them building the
[18:17.300 --> 18:21.220]  infrastructure getting the hype ready getting their citizen spies ready and

[24:24.300 --> 24:31.380]  above 3 million but the point is how are they going to secure millions of miles
[24:31.380 --> 24:39.500]  of roads hundreds of thousands of miles of railway and that's in the CBS news
[24:39.500 --> 24:46.460]  report Schumer calls for don't not ride list for Amtrak and the first commenter
[24:46.460 --> 24:51.220]  Bruce says what an idiot there are hundreds of thousands of unsecured
[24:51.220 --> 24:55.740]  train tracks and thousands of bridges that are soft targets this cretin gets

[25:05.140 --> 25:07.580]  central liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither
[25:07.580 --> 25:11.900]  liberty nor safety that's a paraphrase of Franklin he actually said you'll get
[25:11.900 --> 25:18.740]  neither and every other commenter goes on to attack him see no one buys Chuckie
[25:18.740 --> 25:24.300]  Schumer this is a globalist insider in New York no doubt he knows along with

[25:29.540 --> 25:34.900]  happened on 9-11 it's an attack on you act here's the headline at prison planet
[25:34.900 --> 25:39.580]  dot com and infowars dot com war on terror is a rice stag fire false flag
[25:39.580 --> 25:45.500]  operation have you figured that out yet so they can bring your toddler in or
[25:45.500 --> 25:49.900]  your newborn baby and take their diaper off and by the way they're now talking
[25:49.900 --> 25:55.700]  about proctology exams they're now talking about cavity searches they're
[25:55.700 --> 26:00.300]  now talking about actual chest x-rays because somebody might sew bombs into
[26:00.300 --> 26:06.260]  them and it's the asinine idea on its face that's a joke the government must
[26:06.260 --> 26:15.300]  keep you safe everywhere that's what Kurt Nemo points out in his article that
[26:15.300 --> 26:18.620]  there is a hundred and forty thousand miles of freight and passenger track in
[26:18.620 --> 26:23.380]  the country not counting subway systems in light rail in addition there are
[26:23.380 --> 26:27.380]  three thousand one hundred train and transit stations there were over four
[26:27.380 --> 26:33.260]  billion passenger rail trips last year so just on the face of it how will they
[26:33.260 --> 26:39.380]  keep us safe they won't profile the borders are wide open immigration from
[26:39.380 --> 26:43.820]  the Middle East is it record high numbers if you believe the Muslims want
[26:43.820 --> 26:46.780]  to kill us and there's a billion two hundred million of them in there they're
[26:46.780 --> 26:51.300]  so deadly and I've got a stack of hysterical reports from Dallas to
[26:51.300 --> 26:58.500]  Chicago to people in England wearing their religious garb including Sikhs
[26:58.500 --> 27:04.060]  and Hindus and Buddhists that can't fly I mean if an American or a Brent see
[27:04.060 --> 27:09.940]  somebody in non-western dress they begin to shake in fear and say take all my
[27:09.940 --> 27:14.260]  rights up take them all away I want to be your slave protect me and the
[27:14.260 --> 27:18.620]  governments okay we're gonna have checkpoints everywhere and they were in
[27:18.620 --> 27:21.860]  the news the last week we're gonna have to have body scanners and checkpoints
[27:21.860 --> 27:28.060]  at the mall and the grocery store and see this is the new economy this is what
[27:28.060 --> 27:35.060]  most of the scholarships are for now data mining spying running checkpoints
[27:35.060 --> 27:39.100]  this is the new economy when they told you a service economy not an
[27:39.100 --> 27:42.740]  industrial economy you notice the main line service economy is contracting as
[27:42.740 --> 27:48.140]  well the only area that will get any funding in this fascist government
[27:48.140 --> 27:53.860]  run system are the insider defense contractors that have over 800,000
[27:53.860 --> 27:58.740]  private intelligence spies over three million other auxiliary people who are
[27:58.740 --> 28:03.980]  getting part-time pay so we're close to four million people and growing do you
[28:03.980 --> 28:08.460]  think the terror is gonna go away no the answer is it's going nowhere this is
[28:08.460 --> 28:12.460]  how they get rid of the Bill of Rights the Constitution property rights you
[28:12.460 --> 28:15.700]  can't get corporate documents because of the war on terror can't get government
[28:15.700 --> 28:19.980]  documents it's all about the criminal government class and the corporations
[28:19.980 --> 28:25.980]  that have grown up around it getting away with whatever they want you're a
[28:25.980 --> 28:29.580]  small farmer ranch we're shutting you down with regulations written by Big
[28:29.580 --> 28:35.940]  Agra international agreements by the big European and Japanese trawler
[28:35.940 --> 28:42.500]  companies they come in lobby they shut down almost all fishing in North America
[28:42.500 --> 28:47.220]  I heard the fisherman complaining when I was in Port Aransas this weekend about
[28:47.220 --> 28:50.780]  TV shows I went and looked it up and sure enough the US fishery department
[28:50.780 --> 28:54.140]  that controls the state departments tells the big international trawlers where
[28:54.140 --> 28:59.100]  to go where the schools of fish are and then citizens in many cases can't even
[28:59.100 --> 29:03.860]  catch one fish and are boarded and harassed and they were talking about how
[29:03.860 --> 29:07.340]  the Coast Guard during Port Aransas are at the end of the dock they'll sit there
[29:07.340 --> 29:10.660]  with their 50 cows swiveled you can drive by and see where they've got their
[29:10.660 --> 29:15.500]  ships and 50 cows on the deck and jump on and shove Americans around and get in
[29:15.500 --> 29:20.500]  families fish boxes and go oh let's measure each little redfish meanwhile
[29:20.500 --> 29:25.340]  giant trawlers are bottom pulling just anything they want the government just
[29:25.340 --> 29:30.740]  red carpets them that's what world government is total feudalism total
[29:30.740 --> 29:35.140]  slavery I'm gonna try to settle down and come back go through all the news here
[29:35.140 --> 29:40.180]  the economy the latest been lied the lies and the entire next hour is gonna
[29:40.180 --> 29:45.140]  be open phones on bin Laden and the things you think it's distracting from
[29:45.140 --> 29:49.580]  as the globalist hurl us towards World War 3 and stage chair here domestically

[30:23.620 --> 30:27.660]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[30:27.660 --> 30:31.460]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to

[33:31.220 --> 33:38.460]  we've got a slimy New York big city crime syndicate type senator telling us
[33:38.460 --> 33:43.420]  we're guilty until proven innocent and that they want to have checkpoints and

[34:24.780 --> 34:29.900]  and now every train station every bus station every highways a target why we've
[34:29.900 --> 34:35.820]  got to have checkpoints everywhere what next al-qaeda might attack farmhouses
[34:35.820 --> 34:39.820]  they get intelligence they might be planning to attack fishing villages
[34:39.820 --> 34:43.380]  next they might be planning to attack grocery stores well that's what they're
[34:43.380 --> 34:47.740]  saying soft targets and so the telescreens are going in 9000 locations
[34:47.740 --> 34:54.860]  saying everyone be afraid watch your neighbor meanwhile Osama bin Bernanke the
[34:54.860 --> 35:01.060]  last numbers we got a year ago two years into the banker bailout 27 trillion
[35:01.060 --> 35:05.140]  dollars disappeared and for two years they blocked Congress two plus years
[35:05.140 --> 35:09.420]  from finding out where the money went finally private lawsuits found out where
[35:09.420 --> 35:15.620]  part of it went two trillion of it predominantly foreign banks foreign
[35:15.620 --> 35:23.460]  governments domestic media I'm ladies and gentlemen that's your tax money these
[35:23.460 --> 35:27.900]  crooks know we're going into a depression designed by them they know
[35:27.900 --> 35:31.620]  you're angry they know they have a 9% approval rating so of course they're
[35:31.620 --> 35:35.020]  getting ready to stage new terror attacks and to bring back the same
[35:35.020 --> 35:42.500]  hysteria of pre current and post 9-11 they are invoking it now and we saw the
[35:42.500 --> 35:48.100]  buildup in the month before there are 160 buried al-qaeda nukes oh KSM was
[35:48.100 --> 35:51.420]  tortured he says that have it been laden's killed there's gonna be nukes
[35:51.420 --> 35:57.060]  going off in the weeks before this all scripting the fear where the average
[35:57.060 --> 36:01.700]  person that doesn't pay attention just in the back of their mind goes I heard
[36:01.700 --> 36:06.740]  about nukes they've got nukes so when they nuke us you think the police state
[36:06.740 --> 36:11.420]  was bad after 9-11 and the global is blowing up those three buildings you
[36:11.420 --> 36:14.780]  ain't seen nothing when you wake up there's a mushroom cloud and a hundred
[36:14.780 --> 36:21.340]  thousand dead a million radiated your neighbor is gonna run out begging for
[36:21.340 --> 36:24.940]  tyranny if you speak out against any of the police state your neighbors are
[36:24.940 --> 36:29.460]  gonna try to lynch you at that point you got to defend yourself and the
[36:29.460 --> 36:32.760]  globalists are gonna roll out with their army trucks and they're locally
[36:32.760 --> 36:37.060]  trained police with their list and at that point folks it is gonna be on if
[36:37.060 --> 36:45.220]  1% of the 150 million gun owners resist well you know what that means 1.5
[36:45.220 --> 36:50.980]  million resistors and all Hades is gonna break loose I would advise the
[36:50.980 --> 37:01.660]  globalist to not do this but I was so centered this morning so focused so
[37:01.660 --> 37:08.420]  chilled to my bones so awake
[37:09.260 --> 37:16.780]  driving into work that I have chills right now I can't even articulate to
[37:16.780 --> 37:22.700]  you how a hundred percent I am certain that they are locked in loaded and
[37:22.700 --> 37:26.820]  preparing for giant domestic stage terror attacks in the United States in
[37:26.820 --> 37:33.460]  Europe giant terror attacks on top of it they're also looking you can see their
[37:33.460 --> 37:37.420]  pre fair mongering their preparation they have black ops squads shoot up
[37:37.420 --> 37:44.140]  grocery stores shopping malls churches they will generally take a mentally ill
[37:44.140 --> 37:47.580]  patsy along with them as even mainstream news is admitted they've been
[37:47.580 --> 37:53.180]  finding people with you know Hispanic and Anglo-Saxon last names out of the
[37:53.180 --> 37:57.820]  prisons who have low IQs and are mentally ill continually it even comes out
[37:57.820 --> 38:02.660]  yeah the FBI went and created the group they're trying to point them at at soft
[38:02.660 --> 38:06.580]  targets but they're so mentally deficient that they really can never get up
[38:06.580 --> 38:10.060]  to the actual attack they don't know how to build a bombs the FBI always has to
[38:10.060 --> 38:14.580]  build it for them so the globalist may just go with the dump a dead body routine
[38:14.580 --> 38:20.940]  where they get the patsy shoot up the shopping mall or school and then shoot
[38:20.940 --> 38:25.260]  the patsy in the back of the head and say that somebody else shot him or shoot
[38:25.260 --> 38:33.620]  the patsy in the mouth you know into the brain and then display them or drug up
[38:33.620 --> 38:37.700]  the patsy and then shock therapy them until they're convinced that they did
[38:37.700 --> 38:41.380]  it they got a lot of different systems that they've used but I'm telling you
[38:41.380 --> 38:47.020]  I'm telling you ladies and gentlemen it's not even fear that I've been having
[38:47.020 --> 38:53.660]  it is it is total commitment it is understanding the point of no return it
[38:53.660 --> 38:59.460]  is the unbelievable realization that of everyone fighting the globalist we are
[38:59.460 --> 39:05.660]  the absolute tip of the spear that we have the largest alternative audience in
[39:05.660 --> 39:12.300]  the world the responsibility of that the revulsion of watching Chucky Schumer on
[39:12.300 --> 39:17.340]  the news this morning I remember watching him the night of 9-11 when they
[39:17.340 --> 39:22.820]  had that capital vigil and after the cameras ended the press conference him
[39:22.820 --> 39:26.420]  celebrating and laughing and smiling and talking about all the power they were
[39:26.420 --> 39:33.620]  gonna get it's it's beyond revulsion I I want to be separate from these people I
[39:33.620 --> 39:37.940]  don't want to have to fight them I don't want to look at them I'm tired of it
[39:37.940 --> 39:44.100]  it's beyond hate it's beyond revulsion it is beyond it it's let the nightmare end
[39:44.100 --> 39:48.620]  why are people so gullible why do we have to have such slimy crooks ruling
[39:48.620 --> 39:55.700]  over us why why why why why does it get worse and worse and more and more
[39:55.700 --> 40:05.180]  ridiculous folks I could see the preparatory phase before 9-11 so I went
[40:05.180 --> 40:08.380]  on air and said they're gonna blow up the World Trade Center and blame it on
[40:08.380 --> 40:16.860]  Osama bin Laden their former asset anyone can look at the preconditioning oh
[40:16.860 --> 40:23.500]  if we kill bin Laden nukes are gonna go off three weeks before this out of key
[40:23.500 --> 40:29.780]  outfits AP out of the CIA I mean ladies and gentlemen the CIA has been caught
[40:29.780 --> 40:35.540]  creating fake bin Laden videos people like why do you New York Post New York
[40:35.540 --> 40:41.140]  magazine CBS News Washington Post literally hundreds of big publications are
[40:41.140 --> 40:47.060]  like of course Alex Jones Atlantic Monthly of course Alex Jones thinks it's a
[40:47.060 --> 40:50.860]  conspiracy it's always one isn't it Alex it's just out of the blue you say it is
[40:50.860 --> 40:57.100]  within minutes like I just say that no it was fake on 9-11 it's been fake the
[40:57.100 --> 41:02.620]  last nine and a half years it's fake now it's always been fake it was fake before
[41:02.620 --> 41:07.580]  it happened I told you exactly what would happen I mean if you're awake and
[41:07.580 --> 41:10.900]  have discernment ladies and gentlemen this is like a train coming at you down
[41:10.900 --> 41:15.220]  the tracks from 50 feet away it's blowing its whistle it's right in front of you
[41:15.220 --> 41:21.420]  with a light in your eyes I mean there's no doubting what this is and I want to
[41:21.420 --> 41:23.900]  explain something to the average weak-minded person out there who's a
[41:23.900 --> 41:27.660]  new listener who's not awake yet who's been in the trance deep down right now
[41:27.660 --> 41:31.780]  if you've got any discernment left you got tingles even though you're laughing
[41:31.780 --> 41:37.620]  as a defense mechanism because you know deep down this this is true but the
[41:37.620 --> 41:42.060]  evidence of the staged event is the pre hyping and then the scripting
[41:42.060 --> 41:46.460]  afterwards and then you can go look at the admissions of bin Laden being former
[41:46.460 --> 41:52.380]  CIA Tim Osmond his family being British intelligence Israel founding Hamas
[41:52.380 --> 42:01.820]  that's on record AP Reuters this is how they control the opposition yes there
[42:01.820 --> 42:04.580]  are Muslims that don't like what's happening to them yes there are Muslims
[42:04.580 --> 42:09.660]  that hate the West yes they're a real organic terrorist occasionally it's like
[42:09.660 --> 42:14.020]  fighting a pearl in an oyster it's it's it's it's rare but it does exist by
[42:14.020 --> 42:18.900]  controlling and creating al-Qaeda by leading it the globalist lead the
[42:18.900 --> 42:24.540]  opposition and they lead them into wars with the West so they can be destroyed
[42:24.540 --> 42:32.820]  this is full spectrum dominance but that gets more sophisticated the issue here
[42:32.820 --> 42:36.420]  is they can't protect you at the shopping malls and at the train stations
[42:36.420 --> 42:42.020]  and at all the miles of track I mean that's ridiculous all al-Qaeda would
[42:42.020 --> 42:47.100]  have to do if they existed was get an apartment a mile from a train station
[42:47.100 --> 42:51.340]  and sit there and look out their window cracked for what time the trains come by
[42:51.340 --> 42:57.180]  and then drive a truck up full of explosives sit there and park on a dirt
[42:57.180 --> 43:01.900]  road 200 yards away knowing the trains coming and drive up with the plastic
[43:01.900 --> 43:07.820]  explosive and blow the Amtrak train up and the system knows that that's like
[43:07.820 --> 43:12.820]  trying to protect every roof in Austin Texas from birds going to the bathroom
[43:12.820 --> 43:17.620]  on it it's impossible to protect all those roofs and keep birds from landing
[43:17.620 --> 43:24.620]  on it it's ridiculous they they train you to think the government can will or
[43:24.620 --> 43:29.060]  wants to protect you from terrorist attacks and they started at the airports
[43:29.060 --> 43:33.180]  and the government said eight years ago almost nine years ago that it's going to
[43:33.180 --> 43:39.780]  be to have a job there's going to be like a no-fly no work card and they say
[43:39.780 --> 43:43.340]  if you haven't paid your taxes you're not going to work anywhere whatever they
[43:43.340 --> 43:47.740]  claim those taxes are every purchase you make is being tracked everywhere you go
[43:47.740 --> 43:52.140]  is being tracked with the phones and number five years ago going telecommunications
[43:52.140 --> 43:55.780]  act they're listening to all the phones they're not just listening to some people
[43:55.780 --> 44:01.260]  warrantlessly it's everybody and now they admit it there's nothing more
[44:01.260 --> 44:05.620]  frustrating than being a hundred percent accurate on what's going down here and
[44:05.620 --> 44:13.460]  seeing people who have no idea what we're facing as a society listen I'm
[44:13.460 --> 44:21.700]  gonna tell you right now that cops military bureaucrats people who feel
[44:21.700 --> 44:24.860]  like they're part of the system good old boys folks that like to go to the
[44:24.860 --> 44:27.900]  country club or go to the water cooler or wherever you hang out with your
[44:27.900 --> 44:32.780]  friends and sit around the bar and talk about that dirty you know al-qaeda been
[44:32.780 --> 44:37.700]  live and boy he sure got it do you like being idiots do you like going through
[44:37.700 --> 44:42.780]  life being fed lies you know the globalists are staging these terror
[44:42.780 --> 44:46.940]  attacks to take your liberties they're staging this this new hoax to get you
[44:46.940 --> 44:51.300]  all hyped up to say oh get the other wars only gonna get worse now we got to
[44:51.300 --> 44:55.060]  take more your rights now and then we get the internal homeland security documents
[44:55.060 --> 45:00.060]  from FBI federal martial state police they send them to yours truly we put them
[45:00.060 --> 45:03.300]  out at first people don't believe they're real then the feds admit no
[45:03.300 --> 45:08.100]  those are real and it's nothing to do with al-qaeda gun owners land owners
[45:08.100 --> 45:14.380]  libertarians anti-fetal reserve people their staging events their funding
[45:14.380 --> 45:18.740]  terror groups their protecting terror groups in every case because they want
[45:18.740 --> 45:23.660]  you to fear the outside threats so they the criminal class can take all your
[45:23.660 --> 45:28.660]  freedoms so they can get away with the mass robbery these bankers have stolen
[45:28.660 --> 45:36.740]  at least $27 trillion since October 3rd 2008 if they don't set up a hardcore
[45:36.740 --> 45:41.180]  police state and start shutting down free speech and start setting up these spy
[45:41.180 --> 45:44.660]  grids and the arrest grids that they build in the name of fighting men with
[45:44.660 --> 45:48.820]  big beards and turbans but you get the documents it's all about you and I if
[45:48.820 --> 45:54.180]  they can't get that in place then as they implode everything and bring in
[45:54.180 --> 45:58.340]  their world government their one-child policy government the micromanagement
[45:58.340 --> 46:02.020]  the home inspections the shutdown of the farms and ranches all of it happening
[46:02.020 --> 46:08.100]  the Amish getting swat teamed well the the girl scouts can't sell the cookies
[46:08.100 --> 46:13.380]  you can't have you pack your own kids lunch I mean this is a prison and they
[46:13.380 --> 46:16.860]  understand primitively that if they say an outside threats over there give up
[46:16.860 --> 46:22.060]  your rights you'll stand down so they can get their grin in place and when
[46:22.060 --> 46:27.420]  their grids in place folks then it goes to the next level and there and I'm a
[46:27.420 --> 46:31.460]  nonviolent person they're not going to let you be nonviolent they're coming for
[46:31.460 --> 46:36.540]  all of us they've got rain wash brigades a good old boys everywhere that like to
[46:36.540 --> 46:44.140]  hunt people and they will march against us do you understand you've got to pick
[46:44.140 --> 46:49.940]  aside now you've got to break your trance and admit what's happened World

[50:13.660 --> 50:17.660]  government told us unemployment's 9% when it's been over 22 for three years
[50:17.660 --> 50:24.220]  even 60 minutes it missed that oh they told us bin Laden fought back he used
[50:24.220 --> 50:27.060]  his wife as a shield he lived in a palace none of it true they told us the
[50:27.060 --> 50:30.500]  president was watching live video feeds turns out he wasn't watching any of it

[50:57.860 --> 51:02.220]  and being on these murderers radar I gotta do it hi this is Alex Jones did
[51:02.220 --> 51:05.820]  you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[51:05.820 --> 51:09.060]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[51:09.060 --> 51:13.020]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[51:13.020 --> 51:16.180]  seeds have all performed even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[51:16.180 --> 51:20.100]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at solutions from science
[51:20.100 --> 51:24.220]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a

[01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:16.300]  of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network I haven't even gotten into
[01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:22.740]  the new bin Laden videos they released five of them last Friday at least three
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:28.620]  of the five and we've written articles about this as of Saturday our videos
[01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:35.180]  released years ago and you notice bin Laden has not aged in these videos and
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:41.500]  that it's the same videos with new backgrounds cut in via computer and
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:47.740]  remember the CIA admitted last May 25th in the Washington Post in spy talk that
[01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:51.540]  they had produced fake bin Laden videos this is the same government that created
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:56.460]  fake WMD documents the same system that created the fake Gulf of Tonkin
[01:08:56.460 --> 01:09:01.700]  situation to get us fully and publicly into the Vietnam War the same
[01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:05.580]  government for five years that could keep the Manhattan Project with 200 plus
[01:09:05.580 --> 01:09:11.340]  thousand employees totally secret the same government that kept shooting up
[01:09:11.340 --> 01:09:20.700]  children worldwide with syphilis secret for 30 plus years these people are a
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:23.980]  bunch of control freaks that have practiced creating literally a
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:30.420]  psychological dictatorship of false information as we told you months ago
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:35.540]  they're hyping up an event to start a new war with Pakistan headline Pakistan US
[01:09:35.540 --> 01:09:41.260]  Rift widens they're now hyping checkpoints at the train stations the bus
[01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:45.580]  stations that's already been beta tested but now they're rolling out the public
[01:09:45.580 --> 01:09:51.020]  as if they can protect almost 3 million miles of paved roads hundreds and
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:56.700]  hundreds of thousands of miles of passenger train roads systems it's
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:00.060]  ridiculous none of this is about protecting you it's about creating an
[01:10:00.060 --> 01:10:04.380]  atmosphere of fear so you run to the criminal government that's stolen 27
[01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:07.780]  trillion dollars of your tax money and giving it to offshore banks how many
[01:10:07.780 --> 01:10:11.140]  years did I tell you the bailout went there two months ago it gets released
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:18.540]  foreign banks foreign banks foreign banks now I've told you what was coming
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:22.420]  it's here let me tell you what's gonna come if we don't call the Winehouse call
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:25.820]  Congress people are like well these are the criminals Alex what why should we
[01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:31.900]  call them it lets them know that we know what they're up to ladies and gentlemen
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:39.380]  I'm not risking my life because I believe that we're going to fail I'm
[01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:43.500]  risking my life my name these are dangerous people and I'm boldly going
[01:10:43.500 --> 01:10:49.380]  head up against them because I realize we have no future if we don't these are
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:53.860]  eugenicists these are exterminist these are people who in thousands of white
[01:10:53.860 --> 01:10:57.980]  papers that we've linked to and covered openly say once the world government
[01:10:57.980 --> 01:11:03.380]  set up they just said this last year at Cancun UN meeting Ted Turner and others
[01:11:03.380 --> 01:11:08.900]  home inspections one-child policies forced inoculations forced sterilization
[01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:17.340]  of course they stage the bin Laden bin Laden's always worked for them they've
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:23.860]  trained all the top patsies at US bases it's insane what they've gotten away
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:29.900]  with it's insane what they do this isn't our government criminals have
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:34.460]  seized it they've got the highest tech propaganda in the known world but being
[01:11:34.460 --> 01:11:40.620]  aware of them and their lives is how we defeat them and if we get the word out
[01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:47.060]  about what they're planning this show probably had maximum 500,000 600,000
[01:11:47.060 --> 01:11:53.060]  listeners who routinely listened in 2001 when I warned people now every week
[01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:58.900]  tens of millions of people are touched by this radio show alone I mean one
[01:11:58.900 --> 01:12:03.940]  YouTube channel we have had five million views last week we've got eight
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:09.180]  different channels five million views one venue and then thousands of other
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:12.740]  copies of those videos were made with untold hundreds of thousands of other
[01:12:12.740 --> 01:12:17.860]  views we're on big AM and FM stations across the country we have the number
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:23.580]  one podcast number one streamed shot cast we are exploding I am risking my
[01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:29.140]  life I mean I can feel in my gut in my instincts in my spirit I have never been
[01:12:29.140 --> 01:12:33.060]  in more danger ladies and gentlemen and you know what I'm up to the challenge
[01:12:33.060 --> 01:12:38.980]  don't ever say I failed don't let them use my destruction as a way to say we
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:43.980]  failed whatever they set me up with whatever they do to me if that comes
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:50.700]  don't ever feel bad for me just take the info be an example because they can
[01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:54.660]  get us individually but they cannot stop us collectively and they cannot stop
[01:12:54.660 --> 01:13:04.820]  ideas I said I'd go to your phone calls I'm just I am so overdriven that I can't
[01:13:04.820 --> 01:13:12.860]  even get to the news I can't even get past how upset I am we've got Dr.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:16.500]  Blalock coming up because I had him set up for last Monday with key
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:21.820]  information about Alzheimer's and what's causing the epidemic of it and how to
[01:13:21.820 --> 01:13:26.220]  protect people and what's fluoride does and what the vaccines are doing and the
[01:13:26.220 --> 01:13:31.980]  government healthcare plan former brain surgeon retired top brain surgeon and
[01:13:31.980 --> 01:13:37.420]  because he's on for that hour I will do an hour of overdrive to cover the news
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:43.020]  and take your calls I've been gone out of town and it's good I took up a few
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:51.100]  days to let me to really focus and really get centered and realize just how
[01:13:51.100 --> 01:14:03.340]  right I am and I I mourn that I mourn deeply deeply deeply that I'm right I'm
[01:14:03.340 --> 01:14:10.740]  mourn that that we have such horribly wicked manipulative evil people in
[01:14:10.740 --> 01:14:17.580]  control you know being down in in Corpus Christi Port Aransas it's the most
[01:14:17.580 --> 01:14:25.420]  saturated military population I've ever seen and I see all these well-meaning
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:31.580]  old World War two Korea War Vietnam vets with their little army captain hats
[01:14:31.580 --> 01:14:35.940]  on and their their you know their army stickers on their car and their their
[01:14:35.940 --> 01:14:39.380]  little wife up there getting the hamburgers at the hamburger shack and
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:43.700]  you see them sitting down they're good Christian well-meaning people and they
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:50.140]  just can't understand how evil the globalist are and as sweet as those
[01:14:50.140 --> 01:14:56.580]  little old ladies and men are they will cheer when people like myself are put
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:03.660]  in FEMA camps and tortured they'll never know that they can electro shock you
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:08.660]  drug you and have you say whatever they want they'll never know the vaccines
[01:15:08.660 --> 01:15:13.780]  they're given are giving them the Alzheimer's they'll never know that they
[01:15:13.780 --> 01:15:18.300]  add additives to the food to hurt them they're like little babies they're like
[01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:21.740]  little children and that's what Christ meant when he said suffer the little
[01:15:21.740 --> 01:15:25.020]  ones it'd be better to tie a millstone around your neck and throw yourself in
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:28.660]  the deepest sea be better to tie a boulder around your neck than to hurt
[01:15:28.660 --> 01:15:34.260]  these little ones and the little ones are the simple minded childlike people
[01:15:34.260 --> 01:15:40.180]  those of us that have the gifts of knowledge and understanding you you see
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:48.260]  the general public and they are children they are children and it's up to the
[01:15:48.260 --> 01:15:56.340]  adults to try to inform the children but you see the globalist they know the
[01:15:56.340 --> 01:16:01.020]  childlike mind of the public and they try to create a climate of childlike
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:05.540]  people of arrested development
[01:16:13.220 --> 01:16:21.660]  I can intellectually historically in an analytic way could I mean look at all
[01:16:21.660 --> 01:16:24.220]  the countries they're overthrown right now look at how they're getting ready to
[01:16:24.220 --> 01:16:27.900]  go for Pakistan look at what they're doing domestically I mean telescreens
[01:16:27.900 --> 01:16:34.180]  going in 9,000 locations TSA PSAs a month ago showing TSA in the malls
[01:16:34.180 --> 01:16:40.580]  getting you ready for it I think it's so ridiculous it's to train you to be a
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:44.740]  slave to line up it's to train law-abiding citizens that you're bad and
[01:16:44.740 --> 01:16:51.300]  you're a prisoner and you're a criminal I mean on its face if Al Qaeda was real
[01:16:51.300 --> 01:17:04.580]  there's no way to protect you other than deporting these people I don't know
[01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:13.100]  what I can say or do anymore I guess the good news is a lot of people are
[01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:17.420]  waking up and I understand why a lot of people don't wake up and want to stay in
[01:17:17.420 --> 01:17:25.220]  a childlike stupor a childlike trance of make-believe because when you really
[01:17:25.220 --> 01:17:34.460]  face the facts when you really do the research when you really live in
[01:17:34.460 --> 01:17:41.220]  reality when you wake up to the fact of how wicked and and truly evil and and
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:46.340]  and and bad these people are the globalists like hurting you they like
[01:17:46.340 --> 01:17:50.620]  it when children die of cancer they like poisoning our troops they like not
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:54.060]  giving a medical care they like stealing their pension funds which they've now
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:18:00.900]  done and don't get in trouble for they like it they enjoy it and every instinct
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:06.700]  I've got is to resist them and I'll tell you why I'm so upset I want to be proven
[01:18:06.700 --> 01:18:14.540]  wrong I want things to reverse I want things to start to get better but
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:21.900]  they're not they're not getting better and everything that's happening like
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:27.220]  clockwork is exactly what I've reverse engineered and analyzed the globalists
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:31.140]  would do it's exactly what I broke down they would do from studying history and
[01:18:31.140 --> 01:18:36.380]  their current operations and reading many of their public and leaked documents
[01:18:36.380 --> 01:18:41.420]  I mean look the big wake-up call was going to urban warfare drills all over
[01:18:41.420 --> 01:18:45.060]  the country myself but also being sent footage by listeners all over the
[01:18:45.060 --> 01:18:50.660]  country and witnessing Marines and army and foreign troops practicing to arrest
[01:18:50.660 --> 01:18:59.180]  Americans and take their firearms and then seeing drills in Arcadia Iowa and
[01:18:59.180 --> 01:19:05.660]  Kingsville Texas and Oakland California and in going to these drills and
[01:19:05.660 --> 01:19:10.940]  witnessing troops allowing me to videotape the mock interrogation where
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:14.740]  you from I'm from San Francisco where'd you get the gear where'd you get the
[01:19:14.740 --> 01:19:20.420]  weapons San Francisco and watching the Marines in their situation tent battling
[01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:28.020]  the militia with blocks on a computer screen the whole federal government's
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:31.940]  just been training the wage war against us right at the time they were getting
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:36.740]  rid of Glass-Steagall and setting up this banking takeover all right I'm gonna
[01:19:36.740 --> 01:19:46.060]  come back go your calls Tim Joe Haboo John Janice and others you know every
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:49.500]  time I look at the info wars.com screen and see Chuckie Schumer calls for

[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:13.740]  quoted saying this path will lead to insolvency resulting in the collapse of

[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:10.900]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:16.220]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:21.220]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling
[01:21:21.220 --> 01:21:25.220]  them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about 70
[01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:29.420]  percent of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our
[01:21:29.420 --> 01:21:33.260]  friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar
[01:21:33.260 --> 01:21:36.900]  will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their

[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:18.580]  just claim that they find al-qaeda data anywhere they want and the feds take it
[01:24:18.580 --> 01:24:23.180]  over shopping malls train stations they've been quietly already rolling it
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:28.620]  out beta testing it internal passport as Ron Paul called it almost four years
[01:24:28.620 --> 01:24:33.820]  ago okay let's start going to your calls and later in the hour I'll get into 10
[01:24:33.820 --> 01:24:37.980]  facts that prove the bin Laden fable is a contrived hoax I just can't believe
[01:24:37.980 --> 01:24:45.540]  they released these what five new videos and on record most of the videos were
[01:24:45.540 --> 01:24:50.860]  old videos with new backgrounds the exact same video without audio so that
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:56.740]  people can't obviously tell that and then the side shot of a guy watching TV I
[01:24:56.740 --> 01:25:01.540]  mean it's just so contrived just like it was contrived we told you days before
[01:25:01.540 --> 01:25:05.980]  that photo of the situation room them watching the live bin Laden killed we
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:09.300]  had insiders on to tell you it was fake came out it was fake but I didn't even
[01:25:09.300 --> 01:25:12.740]  need insiders I could look at the contrived photo and tell you it was
[01:25:12.740 --> 01:25:17.740]  fake but it's like oh well they lied about that but you know they lie about
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:23.580]  everything let's talk to Tim in Washington Tim you're on the air thanks
[01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:29.100]  for holding oh no problem how's it going Alex I'd like to just point out a
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:32.100]  couple things that my brain is telling me to think about and that's the fact
[01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:36.220]  that they stopped testing for radioactive pollution from Fukushima and at the
[01:25:36.220 --> 01:25:41.100]  same time they're hyping nuclear terrorist attacks how makes me suspicious
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:46.620]  well that's right they're saying 160 al-qaeda bombs are buried KSM says
[01:25:46.620 --> 01:25:51.540]  they're buried I got tortured for what is it six years I mean he could you know
[01:25:51.540 --> 01:25:56.940]  tell you anything they wanted and if they kill bin Laden nukes will go off
[01:25:56.940 --> 01:26:01.940]  boom bin Laden's killed all of it scripted and for a month now the feds
[01:26:01.940 --> 01:26:05.420]  don't release any radiation numbers the states last time they did three weeks
[01:26:05.420 --> 01:26:11.860]  ago said 500 times safe levels of certain isotopes and then there's video from
[01:26:11.860 --> 01:26:16.220]  the webcams of the media showing smoke and what looks like explosions at
[01:26:16.220 --> 01:26:20.460]  Fukushima and they admit it may be burning for nine months a year two years
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:25.340]  and it's like don't worry about that nuclear plants melting down just look
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:30.220]  al-qaeda may get you any minute forget the 30,000 killed on the US Mexican
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:35.140]  border the last few years rocket attacks bedlam kidnapings exploding isn't that
[01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:38.820]  guy with the big beard named bin Laden scary we've got a setup checkpoints
[01:26:38.820 --> 01:26:45.460]  nationwide right well can he use this as a vehicle to like quote-unquote see
[01:26:45.460 --> 01:26:48.900]  that al-qaeda smuggled nukes while Fukushima was venting and that's why
[01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:53.220]  they didn't see the radioactivity because from what I've learned over this
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:57.180]  is that they can see nuclear radiation from anywhere they have the satellite
[01:26:57.180 --> 01:27:02.060]  technology to do that now they had that decades ago that pick it up they can look
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:08.460]  through solid rock and pick it up sir if anyone believes that al-qaeda buried
[01:27:08.460 --> 01:27:13.500]  160 nukes quote under federal buildings and look the globalist could not just
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:17.620]  detonate one nuke they built all these underground bases they want eugenics they
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:21.420]  could blow up every major city I mean the and then they'll nuke a bunch of
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:26.700]  countries it's unlimited their eugenics they say they want a world government to
[01:27:26.700 --> 01:27:31.620]  then wipe out the majority of us and we're like oh our government loves us
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:37.460]  they want to fight al-qaeda they care so much about us I mean these people for
[01:27:37.460 --> 01:27:41.940]  60 years have been caught racing around doing secret tests I remember eight years
[01:27:41.940 --> 01:27:47.100]  ago New York Daily News had articles about foster kids being taken and they
[01:27:47.100 --> 01:27:50.700]  told the black woman in one case you can pull up her case I forget her name but
[01:27:50.700 --> 01:27:54.860]  she was African-American they said let us have the eight-year-old or we'll take
[01:27:54.860 --> 01:28:01.020]  the two-year-old CPS sign these forms and they gave the kid to a big pharma
[01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:05.820]  company who tested pesticides on him till he died and they put the paper and
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:10.460]  nobody gets in trouble I mean they take kids and feed them pesticides you can
[01:28:10.460 --> 01:28:14.700]  pull it up I mean these people are murderers killers the whole government
[01:28:14.700 --> 01:28:19.820]  scumbag murderers at the top total liars of course the bed live is fake it's all
[01:28:19.820 --> 01:28:25.300]  fake it's all lies it's a group of psychopaths it's funny to them I bless
[01:28:25.300 --> 01:28:29.580]  you Tim I just can't handle it anymore I can't handle it anymore I mean this is

[01:34:46.820 --> 01:34:57.100]  up with live polio or syphilis all on record just last year CBS headline UN

[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:05.020]  it all over the world different manufacturers it was a particularly
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:14.060]  weaponized type 50 60 years ago Asia Africa Latin America when the villagers
[01:35:14.060 --> 01:35:17.980]  wanted the witch the white witch doctor stuff they'd run up they'd line up for
[01:35:17.980 --> 01:35:22.380]  it oh please see my child now all over the world you can pull the reports the
[01:35:22.380 --> 01:35:27.540]  Africans and others will run they will jump off cliffs in cases to get away
[01:35:27.540 --> 01:35:33.120]  from the men in the white lab coats of course usually the idiot western
[01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:36.820]  doctors don't even know it's like the UN has given us the vaccines we're here to
[01:35:36.820 --> 01:35:41.460]  help you they believe they're helping they give the shots drive out helicopter
[01:35:41.460 --> 01:35:45.180]  out people start dropping dead another victory for the globalist oh but they
[01:35:45.180 --> 01:35:51.940]  wouldn't stage 9 11 in such a nice new world order alright let's continue with
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:55.180]  your calls Joe and pencil van you were talking about people you were talking to
[01:35:55.180 --> 01:36:00.460]  in your area go ahead and you know you know you know you have an awesome
[01:36:00.460 --> 01:36:04.140]  responsibility I mean you said it numerous times that you're like the
[01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:11.380]  biggest name in the movement and and I was kind of thinking nationwide I mean
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:18.100]  which are what you thought on on having chapters nationwide of of of info wars
[01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:22.740]  and getting people together under that banner so that we can stand up coordinate
[01:36:22.740 --> 01:36:26.780]  with each other be a modern-day minute man and because you guys are so
[01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:30.620]  distracted they got their hands in so many pies I they can't keep track of
[01:36:30.620 --> 01:36:36.460]  all of us and it's just we have to do something we have to be able to stand up
[01:36:36.460 --> 01:36:43.380]  in a coordinated way and and and try to do something because I mean here's an
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:48.020]  issue if I ever create a major organization then it's easy to cut the
[01:36:48.020 --> 01:36:53.740]  head off of the snake and here's why they will create chapters of the group and
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:58.300]  then do bad things in the name of the information I put out they already try
[01:36:58.300 --> 01:37:04.700]  that at the same time though we are the sons and daughters of liberty it's
[01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:08.740]  it's it's look we know about the private fellow reserve we know about the new
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:12.380]  world order that's why I support all the other organizations and groups that are
[01:37:12.380 --> 01:37:16.740]  out there that you know I watch over time and and and can tell their feds or
[01:37:16.740 --> 01:37:20.540]  not if I'm not supporting somebody it means I don't know about them or be
[01:37:20.540 --> 01:37:24.660]  they've turned out to be really bad news that's what Cass Sunstein does you know
[01:37:24.660 --> 01:37:29.180]  the White House admits they come out and create Liberty groups Patriot groups
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.500]  what are the Democrats been caught doing nationwide they've been caught
[01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:37.860]  creating fake tea party groups to then have signs about blacks being bad and
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:44.380]  and things like that so they got a lot of dirty tricks and and by the way if you
[01:37:44.380 --> 01:37:47.340]  try to start an organization to get active you will run into these people
[01:37:47.340 --> 01:37:51.100]  and the key is don't even talk to them just videotape them in case they try to
[01:37:51.100 --> 01:37:56.500]  set you up folks if you want to find out how evil this government is go get
[01:37:56.500 --> 01:38:01.300]  involved he will instantly have cops walk up I mean you could be trying to
[01:38:01.300 --> 01:38:05.220]  feed homeless people and cops will show up in plain clothes and say let's blow
[01:38:05.220 --> 01:38:10.060]  stuff up they don't want you doing anything they want you to lay down they
[01:38:10.060 --> 01:38:13.220]  don't want you fishing on your own in the Gulf of Mexico they don't want you
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:17.180]  having your own farmer ranch they don't want you selling pumpkins and eggs they
[01:38:17.180 --> 01:38:22.020]  don't want you selling milk the folks this is feudalism feudalism isn't is an
[01:38:22.020 --> 01:38:26.020]  economic system of total degradation where you're kept right at starvation
[01:38:26.020 --> 01:38:30.900]  so that they control you through poverty and where through government control the
[01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:35.900]  elite run everything and I'm not poo-pooing your idea also in a
[01:38:35.900 --> 01:38:42.020]  subconscious level I've made every step forward and if I move to organize
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:48.140]  people number one I can't even organize my own office half the time I mean we're
[01:38:48.140 --> 01:38:53.220]  a small organization but I do need to write a manifesto I do need to codify
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:39:00.020]  the ideas I've done in the films I do need to create a leaderless resistance
[01:39:00.020 --> 01:39:06.420]  blueprint that where I put up my idea of the code of liberty and then just so
[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:10.940]  people can themselves organize and then decide if that's something they believe
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:14.980]  in to stick with because I've learned to a certain degree thanks to God's
[01:39:14.980 --> 01:39:19.140]  providence to not be infiltrated to not be defeated and believe me I've been
[01:39:19.140 --> 01:39:24.740]  through hell ladies and gentlemen but it's always been a great reward in the
[01:39:24.740 --> 01:39:33.020]  bounty of awakening that we've caused praise goes of course to God but it's
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:37.340]  just so overwhelming I mean it is just a false reality of this information Joe
[01:39:37.340 --> 01:39:44.380]  and I don't even know what to say at this point I mean I'm beside myself right
[01:39:44.380 --> 01:39:52.700]  now I really am I think about all the millions of people the New World Order
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:57.340]  is killed I think about how incredibly cunning and ruthless they are and if
[01:39:57.340 --> 01:40:01.140]  people would just break out of their trance and see it we could turn it
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:05.660]  around this doesn't have to happen but with the World Council of Churches with
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:12.260]  the Rockefellers the National Council of Churches domestically they've taken over
[01:40:12.260 --> 01:40:22.820]  our churches I just see how sheep like the average man is I see how sheep like
[01:40:22.820 --> 01:40:29.260]  the average woman is and more than that I can't enjoy anything now I mean my
[01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:34.100]  life is completely fulfilled I appreciate your call I mean I don't want
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:38.580]  for things so it's not that I'm even unhappy I'm just completely overtaken
[01:40:38.580 --> 01:40:42.940]  with reality and now I can't go anywhere do anything without seeing the
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:47.100]  brainwashing seeing the conditioning watching how the general public is
[01:40:47.100 --> 01:40:52.900]  acting more and more rat-like more and more angry more and more disgusted with
[01:40:52.900 --> 01:40:57.980]  each other because they are worldly people and they believe that they
[01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:00.900]  should be fulfilled because they did what the television set told them to do
[01:41:00.900 --> 01:41:08.060]  and they're not fulfilled you know where I find happy people in rural areas with
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:13.420]  poor hard-working people people say thank you they say hello they're
[01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:17.820]  interesting they're awake they have that spark on their eye the more trendy the
[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:25.300]  more television the more city like you go to one town everybody's saying hi what
[01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:31.740]  cute children you have everybody seems happy you if you go to a cheap restaurant
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:36.860]  at the coast everybody's nice in it on average you go to some nicer restaurant
[01:41:36.860 --> 01:41:40.060]  everybody's mad your kids are there even though there's other people have their
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:43.220]  kids there and your kids are being good and decadent old ladies with their
[01:41:43.220 --> 01:41:47.180]  jewelry are looking at y'all angry looking for no reason I mean it's just a
[01:41:47.180 --> 01:41:53.460]  spirit of evil a spirit of decadence and bloatedness and and and we're all
[01:41:53.460 --> 01:42:03.980]  decadent of a certain degree we are a artificial society it's corrupt there
[01:42:03.980 --> 01:42:09.540]  wasn't television 70 years ago people live differently for all of human
[01:42:09.540 --> 01:42:14.060]  civilization till 70 years ago with television now we're not influenced by
[01:42:14.060 --> 01:42:20.500]  our neighbors or our grandfather who we admire or by the classic novels we read
[01:42:20.500 --> 01:42:27.540]  we're influenced by this artificial crud that people are force-fed
[01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:36.580]  now I've seen the statistics of Americans being four or five times more
[01:42:36.580 --> 01:42:45.700]  narcissistic than anybody else in the world and world studies and Americans
[01:42:45.700 --> 01:42:50.900]  weren't very narcissistic just 56 years ago and they have all these
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:57.780]  definitions of narcissism but for me narcissism is being three years old and
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:43:02.300]  imagining that you're Superman and you're meant to be narcissistic when
[01:43:02.300 --> 01:43:05.780]  you're three years old you're building up your identity but you're imagining
[01:43:05.780 --> 01:43:09.180]  your Superman you're standing on the back porch with your friends and you
[01:43:09.180 --> 01:43:14.980]  jump down off the back porch you know with your imaginary laser vision and
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:19.900]  blast them and or a three-year-old four-year-old girl is imagining their
[01:43:19.900 --> 01:43:23.820]  Apprentice but at a certain point you consciously when I was about three
[01:43:23.820 --> 01:43:28.420]  realized this isn't real I'm a limited creature there's this whole other world
[01:43:28.420 --> 01:43:32.820]  all these people have come before me others will come after me I am a
[01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:38.860]  limited spectrum a limited perception creature and I am not the world and the
[01:43:38.860 --> 01:43:46.540]  world doesn't revolve around me and I watch adults I watch men posing and
[01:43:46.540 --> 01:43:50.820]  talking and giggling and laughing and and in telling stories and putting on
[01:43:50.820 --> 01:43:55.580]  acts for other men I watch women women don't get dressed up and try to look
[01:43:55.580 --> 01:44:03.700]  good for men anymore they do it for other women and it's all just just this
[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:11.580]  like this king's court of rotting meat and they're not even real people pick
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:14.980]  up their political positions on what they think is popular what they think is
[01:44:14.980 --> 01:44:19.060]  winning what they think is that you know the team that's gonna win like a band
[01:44:19.060 --> 01:44:26.980]  wagon and the teams are fake it's all a facade I mean do you understand what it
[01:44:26.980 --> 01:44:37.660]  means that the globalist in their UN biological diversity assessments and Ford
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:45.340]  Foundation Carnegie Club of Rome Bilderberg all public they say we're
[01:44:45.340 --> 01:44:48.540]  building a world government we're gonna break up the family we're gonna
[01:44:48.540 --> 01:44:53.420]  basically brainwash the public to love their servitude ahead of the world
[01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:57.380]  government to cut off resources artificially have wars famine and
[01:44:57.380 --> 01:45:02.020]  sterilants in the food and water that's the White House science are currently
[01:45:02.020 --> 01:45:09.260]  Henry Kissinger 73 say apartment random 200 I mean these are murderous
[01:45:09.260 --> 01:45:21.620]  hardcore control freak criminals on the face of it but there's this vestigial
[01:45:21.620 --> 01:45:27.180]  love of liberty this leftover Second Amendment there are these artifacts
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:33.500]  that if they can be dug up and resurrected we'll literally stand
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:37.260]  against the New World Order if we will rediscover what it is to really be
[01:45:37.260 --> 01:45:53.340]  human Haboo in Wisconsin you're on the air thanks for holding thank you for
[01:45:53.340 --> 01:45:59.700]  this opportunity I really enjoy listening to you just a sidebar in an
[01:45:59.700 --> 01:46:05.980]  earlier era and I'm talking about a hundred years ago you would have the
[01:46:05.980 --> 01:46:11.660]  high seat at the table because you were off a warrior class we forgotten what
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:17.940]  that is but you are warriors were held in high esteem because they were the
[01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:23.180]  ones who put their lives for society not now waits hip or what have you and
[01:46:23.180 --> 01:46:28.060]  and and they were given a very high position and let me just tell you I
[01:46:28.060 --> 01:46:33.500]  admire what you do and I'll be a wingman well God bless you my friend but
[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:38.700]  all I'm I want to be clear here today they give us well-meaning warriors in
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:42.420]  the military but they're only allowed to operate in that narrow spectrum and
[01:46:42.420 --> 01:46:47.380]  then serve the New World Order with an American flag wrapped around it but this
[01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:52.580]  isn't even what I'm doing here when you realize how evil these people are all
[01:46:52.580 --> 01:47:01.180]  you can do is resist them and I mean it's not even a question sir but but well
[01:47:01.180 --> 01:47:05.820]  I appreciate your kind words what is your view on the whole bin Laden situation
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:09.820]  because it clearly for when I see there's no question it signifies a new
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:14.940]  rollout of terror the new war with Pakistan war with Iran it is on and
[01:47:14.940 --> 01:47:19.620]  big domestic terror attacks with the globalist floating nuke attacks and
[01:47:19.620 --> 01:47:25.620]  soft-target machine gun attacks on populated centers I mean they 9 oh the
[01:47:25.620 --> 01:47:31.420]  9-11 was the preparatory phase to get themselves positioned globally and
[01:47:31.420 --> 01:47:36.700]  domestically now they're getting ready to really move forward fast
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:43.020]  exactly and I'll just make one point on on the whole bin Laden thing just this
[01:47:43.020 --> 01:47:49.220]  weekend all the newspapers and media were reporting that bin Laden was this is
[01:47:49.220 --> 01:47:53.380]  from you know US officials that bin Laden was still directing Al Qaeda terror
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:48:00.380]  attacks up until his death on last Sunday and if that is the case then one
[01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:05.380]  would think that they would have not killed him on the spot they would have
[01:48:05.380 --> 01:48:08.580]  taken him in they would have interrogated him and they would have kept
[01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:13.060]  him in Guantanamo as they've kept these other people ostensibly to get
[01:48:13.060 --> 01:48:17.140]  information as they've been saying for years and years and years so now they
[01:48:17.140 --> 01:48:21.940]  kill the person on the spot and we are supposed to believe this well here's the
[01:48:21.940 --> 01:48:26.540]  inside word from high-level members of Pakistani intelligence the Iranians and
[01:48:26.540 --> 01:48:30.420]  others and this is what I was already looking at it appears that there were
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:35.180]  some people they wanted to kill in that house and the word is this is even come
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:39.700]  out in the foreign news that it was double agents who were threatening and
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:42.700]  that Pakistan was saying get your drones out of here and we know this happened
[01:48:42.700 --> 01:48:46.740]  or we're going to release the fact that you ran Al Qaeda we know in the months
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:52.620]  after 9 11 that 8,000 Taliban Al Qaeda cream were thrown out were flown out
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:57.540]  under US orders after they were captured out of Afghanistan to Pakistan so
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:02.740]  Pakistan at that level because they had the US back dictator in there at the
[01:49:02.740 --> 01:49:09.020]  time Perez Musharraf they had them in there and so that Pakistan was starting
[01:49:09.020 --> 01:49:12.820]  to blackmail the West and so this is a way to blackmail them back and say we'll
[01:49:12.820 --> 01:49:16.340]  just blame you with bin Laden and that's another reason they went ahead and
[01:49:16.340 --> 01:49:21.420]  launched this at that point but of course they're saying torture so
[01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:26.100]  wonderful and and and he's the ultimate intelligence prize and that's how dumb
[01:49:26.100 --> 01:49:29.700]  they think we are oh we we put him in the ocean because it's Islamic law turns
[01:49:29.700 --> 01:49:34.020]  out the opposite of that I mean anybody knows that you know it's buried
[01:49:34.020 --> 01:49:38.020]  facing Mecca within one day got to be washed by the local Imam and then
[01:49:38.020 --> 01:49:44.340]  buried facing Mecca I mean again basic encyclopedic you know boiled down of
[01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:49.780]  Islamic law there it is sharia law they tell us that that they've got photos
[01:49:49.780 --> 01:49:52.980]  they're gonna release them then they aren't they tell us that the he was
[01:49:52.980 --> 01:49:56.900]  fighting with a machine gun and then he uses wife as a shield none of that
[01:49:56.900 --> 01:50:01.020]  happened but all of that is lies within lies they what I believe they did is
[01:50:01.020 --> 01:50:07.140]  flew a drone helicopter in crashed it to create some debate about that had some
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:11.740]  troops go in shoot some people fly out just standard disinfo I mean you could
[01:50:11.740 --> 01:50:14.980]  see it right there but that's all speculation what we know is he was
[01:50:14.980 --> 01:50:20.660]  dead and but obviously of course why didn't they grab him if it was this
[01:50:20.660 --> 01:50:25.380]  intelligence treasure trove it's ridiculous sir I mean he knows where
[01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:28.900]  all the terrorists are and they got so much intel from these hard drives but
[01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:36.780]  they killed bin Laden and the bodies in the ocean anything else that's it and
[01:50:36.780 --> 01:50:44.940]  it is yours your programming that has let us know that Pakistan's on them on
[01:50:44.940 --> 01:50:50.460]  the short list of countries to to invade apparently they don't like brown
[01:50:50.460 --> 01:50:56.900]  people having nukes well now that's what it is and and it can start World War
[01:50:56.900 --> 01:51:01.820]  3 with China we told you two months ago Pakistan was up next hi this is Alex

[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:47.460]  care about the Warriors in name only when they sign a deal secretly 11 years
[01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:51.740]  ago made public last year to take all their death benefits from World War two

[02:01:37.260 --> 02:01:40.380]  the guy to take them out give them a spin overcoat and dump in the ocean that's
[02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:44.940]  right out of mafia playbook then they come up with all this phony evidence the
[02:01:44.940 --> 02:01:48.740]  guy watching TV's got his back turned you can't even make out who it is there's
[02:01:48.740 --> 02:01:53.180]  no independent pathologist to do an independent study or DNA or anything it's
[02:01:53.180 --> 02:01:57.060]  just everything's just well what they do with Pat Tillman they murdered him and
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:02:00.940]  said Al Qaeda killed him as he fought up a hill and then it turned out they
[02:02:00.940 --> 02:02:04.300]  murdered him they shot him at a distance he begged for his life they sent in
[02:02:04.300 --> 02:02:08.380]  black ops shot him three times right in the face from a yard and a half away I
[02:02:08.380 --> 02:02:12.860]  mean just like private Lynch that whole thing was staged when members of her
[02:02:12.860 --> 02:02:16.380]  team spoke up they murdered five of them in a week and these people are
[02:02:16.380 --> 02:02:21.340]  murdering killers period well they have been they have going all the way back to
[02:02:21.340 --> 02:02:26.860]  the battleship main they've been doing this for a long long time you will war
[02:02:26.860 --> 02:02:32.820]  one that was a phony war in and when it started they want to leave it to a wave
[02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:36.060]  of terror against the Germans it was almost a bad the crystal night they
[02:02:36.060 --> 02:02:40.340]  had they burned down all the shops and lynched them in you could happen here
[02:02:40.340 --> 02:02:44.540]  again if I know in World War one Fredericksburg Texas outside Austin
[02:02:44.540 --> 02:02:49.660]  changed its name and then they claimed that they were Eastern Europeans you know
[02:02:49.660 --> 02:02:54.700]  Romanians and stuff and started not speaking German you know they've been
[02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:58.420]  there you know since Texas before Texas even existed but that's how they
[02:02:58.420 --> 02:03:05.220]  operate and you're absolutely right about that the Lusitania was a British
[02:03:05.220 --> 02:03:10.500]  flagged ammunition ship and the Germans for months ran ads saying don't ride on
[02:03:10.500 --> 02:03:14.260]  this ship we're gonna sink it and the British would sail it back and forth in
[02:03:14.260 --> 02:03:18.620]  front of the U-boats asking him to sink it
[02:03:19.660 --> 02:03:26.380]  I'm shouldn't laugh I'm just so sick German descent Alex and I got an English
[02:03:26.380 --> 02:03:30.580]  sound in last name because when this started my grandfather seen what was
[02:03:30.580 --> 02:03:33.260]  happening went into the courthouse and changed their name right off the bat
[02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:38.020]  because of all the lynchings and a terror it went on but you know if we have
[02:03:38.020 --> 02:03:42.380]  another nuke if they launch a nuclear strike a suitcase nuclear bomb in one
[02:03:42.380 --> 02:03:45.700]  of our cities that's gonna be the end of America that's they'll lock this
[02:03:45.700 --> 02:03:48.940]  country down tighter in a drum they'll bring in the foreign oh no there's no

[02:04:02.100 --> 02:04:06.020]  ago saying they didn't been in internal meetings now it's all public and and the
[02:04:06.020 --> 02:04:09.940]  first thing they'll do is they will go around and pick people up and if I don't
[02:04:09.940 --> 02:04:13.620]  go out and get in the truck so they can torture me and you know threaten me and

[02:08:02.220 --> 02:08:07.940]  radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for
[02:08:07.940 --> 02:08:20.940]  your mind
[02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:27.740]  okay here's the deal ladies and gentlemen I'm gonna do a full fourth hour of
[02:08:27.740 --> 02:08:32.460]  broadcast our stations do carry that fourth hour for years I did the fourth
[02:08:32.460 --> 02:08:40.380]  hour the first 13 years the show I did I did only a three hours then for a
[02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:45.220]  couple more years I did the fourth hour but now because we've almost got our
[02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:50.180]  new TV show ready for launch that takes so many so much time every day I've cut
[02:08:50.180 --> 02:08:54.940]  the show to three hours but most days I did a lot of days now I do do the fourth
[02:08:54.940 --> 02:08:58.940]  hour live we'll be doing that today because I've already now had two hours to
[02:08:58.940 --> 02:09:03.740]  take calls and go over the police state being set up domestically in this whole
[02:09:03.740 --> 02:09:08.500]  bin Laden hoax we've got a lot of evidence now of every facet of the
[02:09:08.500 --> 02:09:12.140]  story being a lie and you can believe whatever you want about it but we don't
[02:09:12.140 --> 02:09:15.060]  know the truth because everything they've told us has been proven to be a
[02:09:15.060 --> 02:09:21.300]  lie and like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts said on last Thursday former head of the
[02:09:21.300 --> 02:09:24.660]  Treasury Department ahead of policy he doesn't know why the government would
[02:09:24.660 --> 02:09:29.020]  be this sloppy and they normally put a story out and stick with so we're gonna
[02:09:29.020 --> 02:09:33.300]  be breaking that down and taking your phone calls coming up the next hour now
[02:09:33.300 --> 02:09:37.140]  though I even though we've been following of this whole bin Laden
[02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:41.900]  hysteria in the last eight days because they're rolling out domestic checkpoints
[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:45.500]  and trying to launch new wars against Pakistan as we told you they would and
[02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:50.500]  trying to boost Obama's approval ratings and he admits that this may help him
[02:09:50.500 --> 02:09:57.340]  get amnesty passed and keep the health care bill in place and get the carbon
[02:09:57.340 --> 02:10:00.540]  tax they had government officials in the White House say this gives him the
[02:10:00.540 --> 02:10:05.900]  political capital to do that some poll show a 9% boost some a 22% boost this
[02:10:05.900 --> 02:10:10.260]  is scary stuff I mean if you even if you believe the official story okay great
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:15.380]  bin Laden nasty guy he's dead what does this have to do with Obama and in his
[02:10:15.380 --> 02:10:20.580]  whole agenda I mean Obama is telling us that the economy hadn't been in a
[02:10:20.580 --> 02:10:25.540]  recession for two and a half years and that the numbers on employment are nine
[02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:31.140]  percent even 60 minutes three months ago now four months ago came out with a
[02:10:31.140 --> 02:10:36.420]  report saying it was 22 nationwide 33 in California every private major
[02:10:36.420 --> 02:10:41.500]  institution that breaks it down says 22 to 24 I mean I've had Nobel Prize
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:46.660]  winners like Joseph Stiglitz on to say it's 22 a year ago the point is they lie
[02:10:46.660 --> 02:10:50.780]  to you we're in a depression I mean look at this economic news well I'm gonna
[02:10:50.780 --> 02:10:55.900]  cover it next hour it is frightening housing crash is getting worse report
[02:10:55.900 --> 02:11:04.140]  Wall Street Journal CNBC home value see biggest drop since 2008 CNBC more jobs

[02:11:49.060 --> 02:11:52.740]  keynote speaker at their event they break it down fastest growing show in the
[02:11:52.740 --> 02:12:01.460]  country our revenue has gone down radio is on the edge of going bankrupt
[02:12:01.460 --> 02:12:06.100]  everywhere now most stations are losing audience in the bad economy we've
[02:12:06.100 --> 02:12:09.940]  tripled it and revenue has gone down what does that tell you about where the
[02:12:09.940 --> 02:12:14.380]  country is half the restaurants you visit around a business most people had
[02:12:14.380 --> 02:12:18.620]  their pay cut prices are going up they deny that there was any inflation until
[02:12:18.620 --> 02:12:22.180]  just a month ago we've known there's been inflation for years now now that's
[02:12:22.180 --> 02:12:26.020]  said why am I shifting gears out of all this will cover it next hour with Dr.
[02:12:26.020 --> 02:12:29.980]  Blalock for the balance of the hour and you could see his detailed two-hour
[02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:33.140]  report up on prisonplanet.tv we're also going to roll it into a film in the
[02:12:33.140 --> 02:12:38.300]  future dealing with a cornucopia of issues he's a retired brain surgeon
[02:12:38.300 --> 02:12:42.860]  expert on brain chemistry written many top published papers help develop some
[02:12:42.860 --> 02:12:48.780]  of the most widely used brain surgery techniques you can go to his different
[02:12:48.780 --> 02:12:54.420]  great websites blalock report.com and read about all the prestigious work he's
[02:12:54.420 --> 02:12:58.020]  done but the main reason I started wanting to get him on two weeks ago is
[02:12:58.020 --> 02:13:01.660]  Ted Anderson and I'll go ahead and tell the story I'm authorized to without
[02:13:01.660 --> 02:13:05.500]  going too far because you know some of its family arguments Ted Anderson the
[02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:07.980]  owner of this network and we'll cover this first and get into a host of other
[02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:11.420]  issues this is something you can protect yourself with we may not be able to do
[02:13:11.420 --> 02:13:15.220]  everything about tyranny right now but but we can do something about our
[02:13:15.220 --> 02:13:22.940]  individual bodies Dr. Blalock again has broken down written about published
[02:13:22.940 --> 02:13:28.740]  papers republished him in his newsletter about statins now my dad's a
[02:13:28.740 --> 02:13:32.340]  denison oral surgeon but he's obsessed with medical papers I remember him 20
[02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:36.300]  years ago raving when I was home from college about these statins are so
[02:13:36.300 --> 02:13:43.820]  horrible you need the good cholesterol it destroys the liver systems and and
[02:13:43.820 --> 02:13:48.180]  the whole metabolic functioning of liver it attacks the brain you need these
[02:13:48.180 --> 02:13:52.020]  proper fats for the brain and remember I'm reading mainline papers but then
[02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:56.620]  Blalock comes on and many others break it down how you need these different
[02:13:56.620 --> 02:14:00.420]  types of good cholesterol for the brain and how the statins attack the brain
[02:14:00.420 --> 02:14:04.980]  well Ted Anderson his dad Ted's been very sad the owner of this network
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:08.980]  because his dad likes to go fishing with him and he couldn't even take him
[02:14:08.980 --> 02:14:13.100]  fishing with him five six months ago because his dad has Alzheimer's and
[02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:18.820]  now doesn't even know who he was well Ted got him to start taking some of these
[02:14:18.820 --> 02:14:23.820]  fatty acids got him to start taking mineral drinks started getting him to
[02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:28.460]  get off the MSG and things like that suddenly his dad was back and last time
[02:14:28.460 --> 02:14:31.780]  I heard there's a whole debate with the doctor if he should be taking minerals
[02:14:31.780 --> 02:14:37.940]  and if he should be taking these fatty acids and it's just amazing what's
[02:14:37.940 --> 02:14:42.860]  going on so we sacrifice our own families on the altar of these medical
[02:14:42.860 --> 02:14:47.060]  doctors and dr. Blalock is a medical doctor I'm gonna go through his giant
[02:14:47.060 --> 02:14:52.140]  bio read it Blalock report calm but but I wanted to get you on sir to talk
[02:14:52.140 --> 02:14:56.140]  about this issue because now we've got brain disorders as you know exploding
[02:14:56.140 --> 02:14:59.380]  you got people at 30 years old getting Alzheimer's type diseases
[02:14:59.380 --> 02:15:04.420]  Gion beret exploding people having epilepsy exploding narcolepsy exploding
[02:15:04.420 --> 02:15:08.980]  the media admits linked to vaccines but but you you define and written some of
[02:15:08.980 --> 02:15:13.300]  the most prestigious papers decades ago they're now mainline science on chronic
[02:15:13.300 --> 02:15:19.100]  brain inflammation so let's start with the statin drugs and Alzheimer's dr.
[02:15:19.100 --> 02:15:27.020]  Blalock thank you Alex a good introduction the statin drugs have been
[02:15:27.020 --> 02:15:31.580]  known to be troublemakers from the very beginning when they were first
[02:15:31.580 --> 02:15:37.940]  manufactured almost 20 years ago now the promise was that when this was our
[02:15:37.940 --> 02:15:43.540]  major weapon against heart disease it was just so impressive we were in a
[02:15:43.540 --> 02:15:48.260]  slash heart disease well 20 years later the incidence of death from heart
[02:15:48.260 --> 02:15:54.180]  disease has not changed at all or very low if what they were telling us
[02:15:54.180 --> 02:16:00.380]  propaganda and his pure propaganda not medical science was true it should have
[02:16:00.380 --> 02:16:05.900]  slipped at least third or fourth in the incidence of death so doctor that means
[02:16:05.900 --> 02:16:08.980]  it's gotten worse because what about half the people that were smokers since
[02:16:08.980 --> 02:16:14.180]  then are not smokers and that's yeah yeah so it was alive from the very
[02:16:14.180 --> 02:16:18.380]  beginning well then when the statistician started to looking at what they were
[02:16:18.380 --> 02:16:24.420]  quoting in their advertising which they advertise in every TV program and popular
[02:16:24.420 --> 02:16:27.540]  magazine when they start looking at statistics they say well you know these
[02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:34.500]  are doctor's statistics that literally they're true but when you look at the
[02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:43.220]  actual reduction in the heart attacks it's no more than one or two percent but
[02:16:43.220 --> 02:16:50.460]  because they manipulate the numbers which you know I show in my newsletter it
[02:16:50.460 --> 02:16:56.380]  comes out 30 percent 36 percent reduction in heart attack but isn't the one or two
[02:16:56.380 --> 02:16:59.940]  because there's been a massive reduction in cigarette smoking well yeah
[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:05.060]  that's played a big role when people are more often exercising and changing their
[02:17:05.060 --> 02:17:09.420]  diet but they leave that out of these statistics you know there's just just
[02:17:09.420 --> 02:17:14.340]  taking the raw statistic well you read the major papers that they constantly
[02:17:14.340 --> 02:17:19.060]  quote they leave out things in the conclusion of the paper and we're
[02:17:19.060 --> 02:17:23.580]  seeing this more and more is that the conclusion of the paper does not match
[02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:29.900]  the data that's in the paper well most passing physicians do not read the data
[02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:34.180]  in a scientific paper they read the introduction and they read the
[02:17:34.180 --> 02:17:39.860]  conclusion a lot just read the abstract well if you read the paper for instance
[02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:44.580]  one of the often quoted papers said that there was increased death from brain
[02:17:44.580 --> 02:17:50.260]  hemorrhage that is never even mentioned in the conclusion of the article well I
[02:17:50.260 --> 02:17:56.580]  think that's kind of important well there's a research article in which it
[02:17:56.580 --> 02:18:03.620]  looked and reviewed virtually ever paper written about statin drug synthesis
[02:18:03.620 --> 02:18:08.260]  inception to see what is the complications associated with it what is
[02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:13.540]  the rates of the complications and the seriousness well I reviewed this in one
[02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:16.900]  of my newsletter and went through all of them well the list is so long it's
[02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:25.180]  unbelievable but we have things that vary from muscle weakness muscle pain
[02:18:25.180 --> 02:18:33.060]  death from a condition that destroys the muscle including heart muscle paralysis
[02:18:33.060 --> 02:18:38.260]  where they can't even get out of bed to increase incidence of ALS which is
[02:18:38.260 --> 02:18:45.540]  considered a hundred percent fatal disease and the effect on the brain and
[02:18:45.540 --> 02:18:51.780]  the heart were the two that were really standout because they're so calm the
[02:18:51.780 --> 02:18:56.500]  incidence of heart failure since the introduction of statin drug is just
[02:18:56.500 --> 02:19:03.540]  grown astronomically well a physician looked at this reviewed the data and
[02:19:03.540 --> 02:19:08.980]  demonstrated that this was because of the statin drug well the heart is very
[02:19:08.980 --> 02:19:14.300]  energy dependent because it's always beating it and never really rest and it
[02:19:14.300 --> 02:19:21.140]  requires high levels of coenzyme Q10 for its energy well the process the enzyme
[02:19:21.140 --> 02:19:27.820]  that produces coenzyme Q10 is also the one that produces cholesterol this drug
[02:19:27.820 --> 02:19:31.940]  blocks that enzyme so it's not only blocking the production of cholesterol
[02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:39.380]  but also coenzyme Q10 that means the heart now is deprived of its major
[02:19:39.380 --> 02:19:45.460]  energy molecule and so it explains why we're seeing this virtual explosion of
[02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:49.780]  heart failure and it's occurring at an earlier age and now they're talking
[02:19:49.780 --> 02:19:53.980]  about putting statins in water for three-year-olds and up yeah well you see
[02:19:53.980 --> 02:19:59.180]  they were talking before that before the water episode they were telling the
[02:19:59.180 --> 02:20:04.460]  pediatricians you need to start doing lipid studies on all children and if
[02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:08.660]  they have elevated cholesterol try the diet first but if their cholesterol
[02:20:08.660 --> 02:20:14.260]  doesn't correct then they should be put on statins for a lifetime unbelievable
[02:20:14.260 --> 02:20:19.420]  well one of the secrets of statins you know I wrote about this for years
[02:20:19.420 --> 02:20:23.660]  that the only reason there's any effect of the statins at all is because it's a
[02:20:23.660 --> 02:20:28.900]  powerful immune suppressant and it's anti-inflammatory has nothing to do with
[02:20:28.900 --> 02:20:34.060]  lowering cholesterol now they're starting to admit that even the mainstream
[02:20:34.060 --> 02:20:39.900]  journals because the evidence was just so overwhelming well who would want to
[02:20:39.900 --> 02:20:45.540]  take a child six or seven years of age and suppress their immunity for their
[02:20:45.540 --> 02:20:50.660]  entire life that's gonna have two effects number one is gonna dramatically
[02:20:50.660 --> 02:20:56.220]  increase their incidence of cancer and two it's gonna increase their incidence
[02:20:56.220 --> 02:21:02.540]  of infection and that's gonna say well we need more vaccination so they like
[02:21:02.540 --> 02:21:08.700]  the idea of producing mass immune suppression epidemics of infectious
[02:21:08.700 --> 02:21:13.900]  diseases and so the public would agree oh we need vaccines to protect our
[02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:17.860]  children this is still let me stop you this is so cold-blooded for those that
[02:21:17.860 --> 02:21:21.420]  don't know obviously you suppress the immune system is the immune system that
[02:21:21.420 --> 02:21:25.340]  stops cancer I was reading a paper a few months ago where they said now they've
[02:21:25.340 --> 02:21:32.940]  got new tests with a blood test that can pick up cancer markers but people got
[02:21:32.940 --> 02:21:36.740]  cancer every week that our own body defeats now they're gonna have millions
[02:21:36.740 --> 02:21:41.180]  more people they can rush in with CAT scans that up up your chances of cancer
[02:21:41.180 --> 02:21:45.980]  oh we found something now we've got to put you on chemo I mean this is just a
[02:21:45.980 --> 02:21:51.020]  cold-blooded business by these people but think about it well it is business
[02:21:51.020 --> 02:21:55.180]  because it's paying no attention to the science you know if you look at the
[02:21:55.180 --> 02:21:59.580]  science of cancer you look at the science of degenerative brain disorders you
[02:21:59.580 --> 02:22:05.180]  look at the science of degenerative heart disorders it's the exact opposite of
[02:22:05.180 --> 02:22:09.460]  what's being done in the medical establishment it's almost as if they're
[02:22:09.460 --> 02:22:14.260]  sabotaging people's health and when we look at the incidence of disease we're
[02:22:14.260 --> 02:22:19.220]  saying degenerative brain disorders in young people now used to be confined to
[02:22:19.220 --> 02:22:26.940]  people in there at least after age 55 now we're seeing age 40 30 20 and growing
[02:22:26.940 --> 02:22:31.340]  numbers well as you start putting larger and larger percentages of the
[02:22:31.340 --> 02:22:36.740]  population on drugs that are known to suppress the major energy molecule of
[02:22:36.740 --> 02:22:41.180]  the body it's gonna have a profound effect on brain function heart function
[02:22:41.180 --> 02:22:45.460]  and it's gonna have a profound effect because the immune suppressing ability
[02:22:45.460 --> 02:22:51.700]  as we said on infectious diseases that fatality from infectious diseases and
[02:22:51.700 --> 02:22:56.220]  it's gonna have a major effect on cancer incident all right we're gonna give
[02:22:56.220 --> 02:23:03.260]  this video slash audio to Ted's father and mother and probably to the medical
[02:23:03.260 --> 02:23:07.100]  doctor as well because I guess a lot of medical doctors now just believe
[02:23:07.100 --> 02:23:11.260]  whatever religious thing they're told by the drug companies but but specifically
[02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:14.340]  from the mainline papers if you can I know I sprung this on you early in the
[02:23:14.340 --> 02:23:17.100]  interview because we're gonna talk about some other issues as well today but if
[02:23:17.100 --> 02:23:20.740]  you can quote the papers for them Dr. Blalock or during a break dig them up
[02:23:20.740 --> 02:23:24.500]  for folks so that we can talk about why people are dying of the brain hemorrhages
[02:23:24.500 --> 02:23:30.900]  and higher numbers what it's doing to the brain I know as a layman the brain is
[02:23:30.900 --> 02:23:36.380]  70% water but the rest of it is predominantly basically a cholesterol
[02:23:36.380 --> 02:23:41.780]  base if I'm wrong correct me what is then a anti-cholesterol drug doing to the
[02:23:41.780 --> 02:23:47.460]  brain well we've known for some time that cholesterol is essential for brain
[02:23:47.460 --> 02:23:52.500]  function one of cholesterol function in the membrane is to prevent damage by
[02:23:52.500 --> 02:23:58.300]  free radical if you deplete the amount of cholesterol in that membrane it
[02:23:58.300 --> 02:24:03.420]  becomes infinitely more susceptible to damage by free radical well that's the
[02:24:03.420 --> 02:24:07.260]  major cause of most degenerative brain disease like Alzheimer's Parkinson's
[02:24:07.260 --> 02:24:13.620]  ALF all these diseases so that puts you to increased risk and it's been known
[02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:21.340]  for a long time that if you lower cholesterol below 170 milligram per
[02:24:21.340 --> 02:24:25.980]  deciliter you're going to increase brain hemorrhage that's accepted well
[02:24:25.980 --> 02:24:32.060]  they're now recommending people have their cholesterol down to 140 130 they
[02:24:32.060 --> 02:24:37.180]  have people that come in to their doctor and they have a cholesterol of 220 which
[02:24:37.180 --> 02:24:41.380]  is perfectly fine and they tell them oh you need to be on statin drugs well
[02:24:41.380 --> 02:24:45.020]  they're 35 years old we put them on statin drugs next thing you know they're
[02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:49.460]  having severe muscle pain they're very weak they can't go to work their immune
[02:24:49.460 --> 02:24:53.620]  suppressor catching every kind of infection they go back to their doctor
[02:24:53.620 --> 02:24:58.620]  and their answer is well we need to switch it to another statin the doctor's
[02:24:58.620 --> 02:25:02.560]  not even aware of what he's doing because if you look in the physician's
[02:25:02.560 --> 02:25:06.780]  desk reference which is the reference for all drugs it says if a patient
[02:25:06.780 --> 02:25:11.580]  develops muscle pain or weakness stop the statin immediately because that is a
[02:25:11.580 --> 02:25:17.460]  early sign of a potentially fatal disease wrapped of myelitis I don't know
[02:25:17.460 --> 02:25:22.580]  how many patients I hear from that are 70 80 years old that are on statin drugs
[02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:27.460]  having a severe pain in their muscles severe weakness and their doctors keep
[02:25:27.460 --> 02:25:32.300]  them on statin drugs and I asked them why is your doctor keeping you on these
[02:25:32.300 --> 02:25:39.260]  drugs when the PDR says that's a prelude to a possible fatal disease and they
[02:25:39.260 --> 02:25:43.500]  said well they think that the heart disease is so much more important well
[02:25:43.500 --> 02:25:48.100]  the doctor has not reviewed the medical studies he's just taking the pharmaceutical
[02:25:48.100 --> 02:25:54.500]  drug representatives word for it and the stuff that comes out in the blurbs
[02:25:54.500 --> 02:25:58.700]  from the big medical centers that's on the payroll and he's not reviewing the
[02:25:58.700 --> 02:26:04.060]  studies which say the the reduction of heart attacks even if you accept their
[02:26:04.060 --> 02:26:08.980]  numbers it's no better than taking an aspirin a day that's absolutely proven
[02:26:08.980 --> 02:26:14.020]  you look in the biggest studies done it is no better than an aspirin a day okay
[02:26:14.020 --> 02:26:18.260]  let me stop you right there doctor because how this all happened is Ted
[02:26:18.260 --> 02:26:21.700]  Anderson that owns the network introduced me six months ago or so to some
[02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:24.820]  young Jevity products some of them are similar to some of the products that
[02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:29.180]  you've developed but they deal with these different fatty acids for the brain is
[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:33.220]  for brain health these mineral drinks and with you know the trace elements the
[02:26:33.220 --> 02:26:36.940]  rest of it and Ted just started testing it out on his dad and it was immediate
[02:26:36.940 --> 02:26:40.820]  his dad couldn't had no short-term memory they'd be fishing he'd know he was
[02:26:40.820 --> 02:26:46.940]  fishing suddenly it's like his dad is back just from some fatty acid pills and
[02:26:46.940 --> 02:26:50.900]  a mineral drink and there's no doubt in his mind that's happening now he's
[02:26:50.900 --> 02:26:54.980]  trying to get him off of the statins because he's read your literature he's
[02:26:54.980 --> 02:27:00.340]  read the papers and even when doctors are confronted with this they don't want
[02:27:00.340 --> 02:27:03.420]  the information is that because a lot of these medical doctors don't want to
[02:27:03.420 --> 02:27:06.900]  admit they've been wrong or that big pharma could be evil it's like a lot of
[02:27:06.900 --> 02:27:10.060]  doctors will say there's no mercury in that shot and you show them here it is
[02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:14.260]  on the on the ampule and they go oh I guess it is in there I mean what's
[02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:19.460]  going on with these doctors and and and what would you tell somebody or let's
[02:27:19.460 --> 02:27:25.500]  say if your family member your father had Alzheimer's and they were on statins
[02:27:25.500 --> 02:27:29.820]  what would you do well I would never put anybody on the statin I wouldn't use a
[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:35.380]  statin for anyone if you know the complications from statin for instance
[02:27:35.380 --> 02:27:40.100]  the incidence of peripheral neuropathy which could be crippling severe pains
[02:27:40.100 --> 02:27:47.300]  and motor laws in your legs arm the incidence on a statin is 14 times
[02:27:47.300 --> 02:27:53.820]  higher than occurs normally now that is a incredible that's a thousand four
[02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:59.180]  hundred percent increase in peripheral neuropathy a crippling disorder
[02:27:59.180 --> 02:28:05.020]  neurological disorder it is accepted as being caused by statin drugs well that
[02:28:05.020 --> 02:28:09.500]  was at the lower dose instead of articles were written they doubled the dose
[02:28:09.500 --> 02:28:13.740]  of statin so we're gonna see a lot more peripheral neuropathy well average
[02:28:13.740 --> 02:28:18.300]  patients go their doctor with peripheral neuropathy at being on statin he's not
[02:28:18.300 --> 02:28:23.140]  even aware it's linked so you're saying Alzheimer's in many cases is just a name
[02:28:23.140 --> 02:28:28.020]  for the effects of statins and other things no you know Alzheimer's is a
[02:28:28.020 --> 02:28:33.940]  specific disease but you increase the risk of degeneration of the brain by
[02:28:33.940 --> 02:28:38.700]  being on statin so what you're saying is it removes the member action it so it
[02:28:38.700 --> 02:28:43.420]  weakens the blood brain barrier membrane well it weakens the membranes of the
[02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:49.380]  brain cells and the synapses in them and the dendrites it when you look at
[02:28:49.380 --> 02:28:53.500]  Alzheimer's disease the first change that occurs decades ahead of time
[02:28:53.500 --> 02:28:58.460]  is a loss of synapses the synaptic connection not the death of the brain
[02:28:58.460 --> 02:29:02.620]  cells that's a very late effect so a lot of people with Alzheimer's disease that
[02:29:02.620 --> 02:29:07.580]  are they're having a problem with their memory and orientation etc they have a
[02:29:07.580 --> 02:29:12.740]  reversible condition if you change that and we're starting to see some of the
[02:29:12.740 --> 02:29:17.900]  things that you do nutritionally seems to certainly slow the disease
[02:29:17.900 --> 02:29:24.660]  dramatically well statin drugs just by their mode of operation can accelerate
[02:29:24.660 --> 02:29:31.500]  the problem because it makes that synapse even more vulnerable and so you
[02:29:31.500 --> 02:29:36.540]  know from what we know of neural science and the neural chemistry involved
[02:29:36.540 --> 02:29:42.580]  absolutely insane to put a person at that risk of a neurological disease on a
[02:29:42.580 --> 02:29:47.220]  statin drug amazing stay there stay there dr. Blalock look let's talk about
[02:29:47.220 --> 02:29:51.780]  nutritional things that you've seen help people who have Alzheimer's we're on
[02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:59.940]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[02:29:59.940 --> 02:30:06.020]  a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[02:30:06.020 --> 02:30:10.740]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything

[02:30:26.540 --> 02:30:30.420]  biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his
[02:30:30.420 --> 02:30:34.900]  work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[02:30:34.900 --> 02:30:38.540]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real
[02:30:38.540 --> 02:30:42.660]  eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this free video

[02:31:04.860 --> 02:31:09.180]  about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal
[02:31:09.180 --> 02:31:13.500]  silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing
[02:31:13.500 --> 02:31:17.380]  the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of
[02:31:17.380 --> 02:31:22.220]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses
[02:31:22.220 --> 02:31:26.460]  the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions and
[02:31:26.460 --> 02:31:31.780]  also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with
[02:31:31.780 --> 02:31:35.980]  continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you can
[02:31:35.980 --> 02:31:40.620]  now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator
[02:31:40.620 --> 02:31:44.780]  very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided making

[02:32:01.340 --> 02:32:06.180]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[02:32:06.180 --> 02:32:10.740]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:14.700]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[02:32:14.700 --> 02:32:19.740]  terminated influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[02:32:19.740 --> 02:32:25.020]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay

[02:33:13.860 --> 02:33:18.100]  we are doing here today than what we're covering with dr. Russell Blalock now
[02:33:18.100 --> 02:33:23.500]  coming up in the next hour I'm gonna get back into the bin Laden situation the
[02:33:23.500 --> 02:33:30.020]  new police state rollout the expansion of all of that that is coming up with
[02:33:30.020 --> 02:33:33.140]  your phone calls if you folks want to hold they can or you can hang up and
[02:33:33.140 --> 02:33:37.260]  call back next hour I'm doing a fourth hour of overdrive to break all this
[02:33:37.260 --> 02:33:43.380]  down and this reelection bid by Obama and the internal checkpoints and
[02:33:43.380 --> 02:33:48.820]  passports that Chuckie Schumer wants to roll out it's already being beta tested
[02:33:48.820 --> 02:33:53.900]  now I've done two hours and 33 minutes of airtime and haven't plugged any
[02:33:53.900 --> 02:33:57.940]  sponsors haven't asked for any support and what happens is when when these big
[02:33:57.940 --> 02:34:05.220]  news events happen I tend to not even you know get into our sponsors or how we
[02:34:05.220 --> 02:34:09.740]  finance this operation like the online video bookstore and info wars.com with
[02:34:09.740 --> 02:34:14.140]  the t-shirts the bulk apps the the books the videos the materials or prison

[02:34:42.580 --> 02:34:46.700]  tomorrow on this show he's doing special interviews from Mexico on this whole
[02:34:46.700 --> 02:34:51.940]  bin Laden hoax show that's coming up tomorrow with Jesse Ventura here first
[02:34:51.940 --> 02:34:55.740]  folks were really excited about it we were calling about getting him on next
[02:34:55.740 --> 02:34:59.820]  month or someone gets back to the US they said how about now so he lives far
[02:34:59.820 --> 02:35:02.980]  away from pavement but he's coming into town to be on our show and some others
[02:35:02.980 --> 02:35:07.060]  so look for that tomorrow a great job the producers getting that nailed down but
[02:35:07.060 --> 02:35:09.500]  the point is if you believe in what we're doing the incredible information

[02:36:10.420 --> 02:36:14.620]  other great sponsor that I want to tell you about is the National Inflation
[02:36:14.620 --> 02:36:20.500]  Association the Federal Reserve's informal inflation target is 1.75% to
[02:36:20.500 --> 02:36:26.700]  2% and now the CPI is 2.68% over a year ago that's a whitewash number the Fed
[02:36:26.700 --> 02:36:31.060]  is now ignoring the CPI and looking at the core CPI which excludes food and
[02:36:31.060 --> 02:36:35.980]  energy which is skyrocketing the two goods that Americans need most to live
[02:36:35.980 --> 02:36:42.180]  and survive 40% of core CPI is comprised of rent rents are still falling
[02:36:42.180 --> 02:36:46.220]  because the real estate bubble was created by the Fed and still isn't done
[02:36:46.220 --> 02:36:50.300]  deflating and therefore the core CPI is misleading it doesn't accurately show
[02:36:50.300 --> 02:36:55.980]  price inflation core CPI exists solely for the purpose of Fed misleading
[02:36:55.980 --> 02:37:00.220]  Americans into believing the price inflation is lower than it truly is I
[02:37:00.220 --> 02:37:06.460]  urge you to sign up for the free NIA newsletter today at inflation.us that's
[02:37:06.460 --> 02:37:11.820]  www.inflation.us to learn how you can only survive but prosper during the
[02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:17.100]  upcoming hyperinflation crisis okay and by the way I'm going to check out the
[02:37:17.100 --> 02:37:21.980]  incredible reports the newsletters the mainline studies the drug inserts they
[02:37:21.980 --> 02:37:26.860]  don't want you to see go to Russell Blalock MD.com or Blalock Wellness
[02:37:26.860 --> 02:37:32.980]  Center dot com to check that out continuing sir finishing up with the
[02:37:32.980 --> 02:37:37.700]  statins and what they're doing in the system knowing this and how doctors can
[02:37:37.700 --> 02:37:41.620]  be so ignorant then I want to shift gears I mentioned this to you it just came
[02:37:41.620 --> 02:37:47.460]  out today but you were already informed about it school districts are trying to
[02:37:47.460 --> 02:37:50.780]  get kids to take all the vaccines really tried to hoax people and say we're
[02:37:50.780 --> 02:37:55.180]  mandatory they're now saying we'll give you we'll put you on a raffle for a
[02:37:55.180 --> 02:38:02.460]  free iPhone or iPad if you get all your shots so just amazing predator type
[02:38:02.460 --> 02:38:05.700]  action to get these kids to take these dangerous vaccines but let's let's
[02:38:05.700 --> 02:38:10.300]  finish up Dr. Blalock again top retired brain surgeon and big researcher into
[02:38:10.300 --> 02:38:15.460]  the brain researched and coined terms like his cytotoxins now in the mainline
[02:38:15.460 --> 02:38:19.740]  literature decades ago terms like chronic brain inflammation that's what he
[02:38:19.740 --> 02:38:24.540]  breaks down Alzheimer's really is and the system knowingly and he gets into the
[02:38:24.540 --> 02:38:29.380]  eugenics their own documents on that in his research the social engineers know
[02:38:29.380 --> 02:38:33.380]  what's happening they've got an aging population the baby boomers they want
[02:38:33.380 --> 02:38:37.700]  to get rid of you folks so they can you know keep all that tax money all that
[02:38:37.700 --> 02:38:41.260]  social security money for themselves but I'm now ranting Dr. Blalock you've got
[02:38:41.260 --> 02:38:46.380]  the floor for the balance of this hour breakdown the rest of what's really
[02:38:46.380 --> 02:38:51.300]  causing this epidemic of a brandy generation the Alzheimer's the statins
[02:38:51.300 --> 02:38:56.060]  then let's get into vaccines and your big reports you've got out dealing with
[02:38:56.060 --> 02:39:01.460]  radio protection dealing with the radioactivity and some of the nutrients
[02:39:01.460 --> 02:39:06.660]  and things that can help protect the body from that Dr. Blalock thank you
[02:39:06.660 --> 02:39:13.060]  Alex thing that you know I try to observe particularly what could be
[02:39:13.060 --> 02:39:18.140]  causing this dramatic increase in neurological disorders as well as
[02:39:18.140 --> 02:39:24.460]  cardiovascular disorders and we're seeing a number of things that was the
[02:39:24.460 --> 02:39:30.900]  statin push is one big thing because it's attacking the energy supply of the
[02:39:30.900 --> 02:39:36.300]  brain and the heart and the necessity of cholesterol at a certain level it
[02:39:36.300 --> 02:39:41.820]  defies their own research and this is what's so shocking about it is if you
[02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:47.940]  look at the major studies that are constantly quoted they don't say what
[02:39:47.940 --> 02:39:53.620]  they're telling the public they say it's often saying the opposite if you look
[02:39:53.620 --> 02:40:04.100]  at the data itself there's a Dr. Beatrice Golem who I met and talked with and
[02:40:04.100 --> 02:40:09.100]  she's written a number of incredible articles on statin drugs it's the best
[02:40:09.100 --> 02:40:15.020]  review articles you can find the most extensive and she convincingly shows
[02:40:15.020 --> 02:40:24.180]  this is an extremely dangerous disease drug and that it's being hyped as doing
[02:40:24.180 --> 02:40:31.700]  things that it's just not doing but we've got a medical system here in the
[02:40:31.700 --> 02:40:35.940]  United States particularly which is just dominated by the pharmaceutical
[02:40:35.940 --> 02:40:41.060]  manufacturers our physicians are leaving their educational systems and their
[02:40:41.060 --> 02:40:46.700]  residency training just heavily brainwashed by pharmaceutical companies
[02:40:46.700 --> 02:40:51.780]  and they don't really you know really realize it you know you would think
[02:40:51.780 --> 02:40:58.100]  for instance someone who spent their life studying brain function could
[02:40:58.100 --> 02:41:02.400]  approach a general practitioner and explain these things to them and they
[02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:09.460]  would understand it and stop prescribing the statin drug but they
[02:41:09.460 --> 02:41:14.660]  look at you like you're crazy and you say well you know what I know about the
[02:41:14.660 --> 02:41:20.020]  brain that far exceeds what you know but you won't listen to me you listen to a
[02:41:20.020 --> 02:41:25.060]  pharmaceutical company I show you the very articles you're quoting and how
[02:41:25.060 --> 02:41:31.500]  they're they're contradictory you still won't listen and they take these people
[02:41:31.500 --> 02:41:36.260]  like the mother you're talking about and they terrifying telling them oh if we
[02:41:36.260 --> 02:41:41.140]  don't get that cholesterol down to 140 if they they get off this drug they're
[02:41:41.140 --> 02:41:46.540]  going to die and yet you look at the statistics of the papers they quote it
[02:41:46.540 --> 02:41:50.780]  does not say that I tell people all the time you go to the doctor and you ask
[02:41:50.780 --> 02:41:55.860]  the doctor now I don't hear any statistics except what is the benefit I
[02:41:55.860 --> 02:42:01.660]  will get from this drug if it works perfectly well at best he could tell
[02:42:01.660 --> 02:42:07.020]  that patient well it might reduce your risk of dying of a heart attack one or
[02:42:07.020 --> 02:42:12.060]  possibly 2% that means you have a 98% 99% chance you're not going to die of a
[02:42:12.060 --> 02:42:18.740]  heart attack and that drug is not going to help you people don't know that they
[02:42:18.740 --> 02:42:22.420]  have the idea I've even had physicians tell them if you don't take this drug
[02:42:22.420 --> 02:42:26.700]  you're going to die of a heart attack just like with HPV vaccine that they
[02:42:26.700 --> 02:42:30.700]  advertise they tell these young girls if you don't get this vaccine you're going
[02:42:30.700 --> 02:42:34.540]  to die of cervical cancer well cervical cancer is extremely rare in this
[02:42:34.540 --> 02:42:40.380]  country the chances of a young girl dying of cervical cancer she's more
[02:42:40.380 --> 02:42:46.340]  likely to get hit by lightning but they're they're purposely manipulating
[02:42:46.340 --> 02:42:52.380]  statistics and data and studies to terrify people into taking drugs and
[02:42:52.380 --> 02:42:58.380]  vaccine now I attended a vaccine safety conference recently with some of the top
[02:42:58.380 --> 02:43:05.420]  scientists in the world experts on adjuvants like aluminum and we all got
[02:43:05.420 --> 02:43:09.460]  together and gave lectures there was no audience it was just just the people
[02:43:09.460 --> 02:43:15.780]  doing the studies in this area the danger of these adjuvants in vaccines
[02:43:15.780 --> 02:43:22.460]  it's just enormous the damage to the brain is incredible it is completely
[02:43:22.460 --> 02:43:27.460]  being covered up the public has no idea how dangerous these drugs these
[02:43:27.460 --> 02:43:32.860]  vaccines are and to vaccinate these children with 36 vaccines before they
[02:43:32.860 --> 02:43:39.500]  start school is incredible the United States has the highest mortality in
[02:43:39.500 --> 02:43:46.180]  children age five and below of anywhere in the developed world because we have
[02:43:46.180 --> 02:43:53.300]  the highest incidence of vaccination in the entire world next is Britain it has
[02:43:53.300 --> 02:43:59.900]  an extremely high mortality rate so if you if you look at the mortality rate of
[02:43:59.900 --> 02:44:06.540]  the infant and the child up to age five in the world it's directly correlated
[02:44:06.540 --> 02:44:10.820]  with a number of vaccines they receive early in life but we're just giving an
[02:44:10.820 --> 02:44:15.580]  unprecedented number of vaccines it's unbelievable and if you look at the
[02:44:15.580 --> 02:44:21.300]  neuroscience literature it tells you you do that you're gonna damage a lot of
[02:44:21.300 --> 02:44:26.940]  brains and that's what's happening in his country you know I'm on the faculty
[02:44:26.940 --> 02:44:32.340]  of biology at a local university and the head of the biology department told me
[02:44:32.340 --> 02:44:36.580]  he said now you have to realize students today are not like when you were in
[02:44:36.580 --> 02:44:43.500]  school said they're really not able to handle this much information anymore he
[02:44:43.500 --> 02:44:49.300]  said you have to kind of dumb it down it is shocking to think that students now
[02:44:49.300 --> 02:44:55.980]  cannot think as well as they did 40 years ago so we're seeing this massive
[02:44:55.980 --> 02:45:01.940]  dumbing down of our youth a massive increase in neurological disorders
[02:45:01.940 --> 02:45:07.500]  even in young people and it's just being swept under the rug and of course it's
[02:45:07.500 --> 02:45:11.500]  not going to be in any popular magazine it's not going to be on any network
[02:45:11.500 --> 02:45:16.980]  because they receive millions of dollars in advertising from farmers who
[02:45:16.980 --> 02:45:21.620]  will I want to stop you doctor now they're coming out with more and more
[02:45:21.620 --> 02:45:26.660]  vaccines that big pharma lobbies to quote make mandatory that itself is a
[02:45:26.660 --> 02:45:30.700]  hoax there's no law you have to take them now is the people learn about this
[02:45:30.700 --> 02:45:34.900]  and record lows have taken the flu shots as you know the last three years and
[02:45:34.900 --> 02:45:39.100]  we've been vindicated that it they had to ban it in England for under fives
[02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:45.100]  because of a quote tenfold increase in convulsions guys search tenfold
[02:45:45.100 --> 02:45:52.780]  increase Britain bans flu jab at under fives tenfold increase I want to show
[02:45:52.780 --> 02:45:56.940]  folks those headlines they won't believe it all of that's come out so clearly
[02:45:56.940 --> 02:46:01.060]  and I've talked about this before on and off air the system at the top knows
[02:46:01.060 --> 02:46:05.500]  what they're doing it's very cold-blooded and it transcends just
[02:46:05.500 --> 02:46:11.060]  profits it's like Bayer pharmaceutical lost in federal court also lost in
[02:46:11.060 --> 02:46:18.300]  France for a decade plus knowingly knowingly shipped out factor rate that
[02:46:18.300 --> 02:46:22.940]  had hepatitis and HIV in it that's where they pool again masses of different
[02:46:22.940 --> 02:46:25.900]  blood types together extract the platelets for folks that don't know
[02:46:25.900 --> 02:46:29.620]  there's the London Telegraph headline flu jab linked to fits under fives
[02:46:29.620 --> 02:46:34.380]  officials and fits are what they call convulsions in England then you read it
[02:46:34.380 --> 02:46:39.940]  says was linked to a tenfold increase in convulsions so they know what they're
[02:46:39.940 --> 02:46:44.420]  doing at the top the average doctor buys into the evil through ignorance once
[02:46:44.420 --> 02:46:48.020]  they see the facts they don't want to admit they're wrong it's cognitive
[02:46:48.020 --> 02:46:54.380]  dissonance and now I mean I have to tell you my dad top of his class super
[02:46:54.380 --> 02:46:59.260]  smart you know could do all the calculus everything else super simple
[02:46:59.260 --> 02:47:04.740]  rest of my family really smart I don't think I'm as smart as they are I try to
[02:47:04.740 --> 02:47:08.180]  talk to the general public even professionals and it's like they're in
[02:47:08.180 --> 02:47:13.340]  the days they're in a trance they're slow I've seen statistics that the US IQ
[02:47:13.340 --> 02:47:17.220]  has dropped that's not education for those that don't know physically we're
[02:47:17.220 --> 02:47:24.500]  getting dumber our sperm counts down by 87% every form of diabetes cancer brain
[02:47:24.500 --> 02:47:29.100]  degeneration it's off the charts we're being soft killed doctor this is eugenics
[02:47:29.100 --> 02:47:33.500]  I mean we have to address what this is they know full well what they're doing
[02:47:33.500 --> 02:47:38.500]  and it is I mean you've got the White House science are writing a 1,100 page
[02:47:38.500 --> 02:47:42.700]  book saying we need to put stuff in the water to sterilize people I mean these
[02:47:42.700 --> 02:47:50.780]  are a group of of many acts well you know just the vaccine thing it with this
[02:47:50.780 --> 02:47:57.220]  H1N1 they had an increase in narcolepsy in these young children of ninefold
[02:47:57.220 --> 02:48:03.300]  well narcolepsy is a terrible disorder I mean it'll ruin your life there's no
[02:48:03.300 --> 02:48:09.020]  justification for having ruined those child's lives when their own data even
[02:48:09.020 --> 02:48:16.340]  from the CDC showed the effectiveness in the child was nil the whole thing was
[02:48:16.340 --> 02:48:20.860]  hoax and you know we said that on your program this is the hoax don't listen to
[02:48:20.860 --> 02:48:25.540]  it well what happens that the World Health Organization said well it wasn't
[02:48:25.540 --> 02:48:31.580]  a pandemic which means it was a hoax and it was a cruel hoax because it is now
[02:48:31.580 --> 02:48:37.220]  ruined the lives of tens of thousands of children and you'd have to multiply that
[02:48:37.220 --> 02:48:42.380]  at least by a factor of tenfold maybe a hundredfold I would estimate there are
[02:48:42.380 --> 02:48:47.540]  tens of millions of children whose lives have been ruined by this vaccine and the
[02:48:47.540 --> 02:48:52.900]  other vaccine the thing is its parents don't know any different so when junior
[02:48:52.900 --> 02:48:58.420]  becomes a behavioral problem or develops a seizure or develops a abnormal
[02:48:58.420 --> 02:49:03.820]  behavior psychosis suicide they don't have a clue that that could be related
[02:49:03.820 --> 02:49:07.900]  to the vaccine and if they do and they go to their doctor and say doctor could
[02:49:07.900 --> 02:49:12.660]  this be due to the vaccine that my child is now having this behavioral problem
[02:49:12.660 --> 02:49:17.260]  he assures them no but when I go to that doctor and I said doctor do you know
[02:49:17.260 --> 02:49:22.060]  what a vaccine does to the microglia in the brain he said what's a microglia
[02:49:22.060 --> 02:49:27.580]  well you know if you're vaccinating children with these powerful adjuvants
[02:49:27.580 --> 02:49:32.420]  in mass doses and you don't know that that massively activates one of the
[02:49:32.420 --> 02:49:37.900]  primary immune cells in the brain and produces chronic brain inflammation and
[02:49:37.900 --> 02:49:43.180]  disrupts the formation of the brain you shouldn't be given the vaccine and that's
[02:49:43.180 --> 02:49:46.900]  what we have in this by the way doctor I'm no rocket scientist but I know how to
[02:49:46.900 --> 02:49:51.580]  read the vaccine inserts it says it on the stinking things well I mean there's
[02:49:51.580 --> 02:49:55.260]  so much literature in the neuroscience literature the effect of powerful
[02:49:55.260 --> 02:50:01.220]  activation of the systemic immunity and it's the fact on the brain to do what
[02:50:01.220 --> 02:50:06.420]  they're doing to these children is absolute insanity now the toxicity of
[02:50:06.420 --> 02:50:11.900]  the aluminum in the vaccine is enormous we have so much literature on it I
[02:50:11.900 --> 02:50:16.460]  heard from some of the the top experts in the world aluminum toxicity at this
[02:50:16.460 --> 02:50:21.100]  meeting that we all took turns lecturing and talking about this there's no
[02:50:21.100 --> 02:50:25.660]  question that aluminum is disrupting the development of these children's brain
[02:50:25.660 --> 02:50:31.300]  aluminum is an enormous brain toxin it almost as bad as mercury when you have
[02:50:31.300 --> 02:50:36.980]  both you have synergistic toxicity to the brain which is incredible so none of
[02:50:36.980 --> 02:50:40.340]  us should be eating off aluminum or drinking out of aluminum cans absolutely
[02:50:40.340 --> 02:50:44.740]  should avoid aluminum and it's put in all kinds of over-the-counter medications
[02:50:44.740 --> 02:50:50.580]  sun blockers stuff they rub on their skin that's absorbed into the skin and
[02:50:50.580 --> 02:50:55.420]  now what they're doing with the luminous nanosizing aluminum well I did an
[02:50:55.420 --> 02:51:00.660]  aluminum stay there doctor this is too incredible unbelievable over right back
[02:51:00.660 --> 02:51:06.340]  food prices are spiraling out of control in order to survive you will soon need
[02:51:06.340 --> 02:51:11.180]  to produce some or all of your own food in your backyard or small farm many years
[02:51:11.180 --> 02:51:16.020]  ago sought after radio guest Marjorie Wildcraft and her family began working to
[02:51:16.020 --> 02:51:20.340]  find the easiest ways to grow food for the crisis we are now facing Marjorie
[02:51:20.340 --> 02:51:24.260]  created a video that is the fastest way to learn how to grow food you'll learn
[02:51:24.260 --> 02:51:28.080]  the most efficient gardening methods myths and truths of orchards and edible
[02:51:28.080 --> 02:51:31.740]  landscaping effective predator protection and even home butchering
[02:51:31.740 --> 02:51:35.700]  everyone is talking about Marjorie's DVD and it's highly recommended by Jim
[02:51:35.700 --> 02:51:40.300]  Rawls Jack Spurko and bountiful gardens read her free reports on how to have a
[02:51:40.300 --> 02:51:45.100]  green thumb making free fertilizer and answers the question do you need a gun
[02:51:45.100 --> 02:51:49.740]  to garden if you want the security savings and freedom of food self-reliance
[02:51:49.740 --> 02:51:54.980]  by Marjorie's DVD and get the free reports at backyard food production

[02:52:04.620 --> 02:52:08.700]  key information the US government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the
[02:52:08.700 --> 02:52:12.500]  Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government bonds to foreign
[02:52:12.500 --> 02:52:17.500]  central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds in order to
[02:52:17.500 --> 02:52:21.780]  rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling them
[02:52:21.780 --> 02:52:26.100]  currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about 70% of
[02:52:26.100 --> 02:52:30.580]  US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our friends at
[02:52:30.580 --> 02:52:34.140]  the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar will soon
[02:52:34.140 --> 02:52:37.860]  become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their incomes
[02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:42.900]  and savings destroyed I strongly urge my fellow Americans to sign up for the
[02:52:42.900 --> 02:52:49.140]  free NIA newsletter at www.inflation.us if you are sick and tired of the
[02:52:49.140 --> 02:52:54.420]  economic propaganda the mainstream media sign up for free at inflation.us to
[02:52:54.420 --> 02:53:00.620]  learn the economic truth that the mainstream media ignores it is well
[02:53:00.620 --> 02:53:04.740]  known that protein nutrition is a key to optimum blood sugar levels but to
[02:53:04.740 --> 02:53:08.460]  benefit at all from protein your body must first be able to break down protein
[02:53:08.460 --> 02:53:12.860]  into amino acids once amino acids are liberated from proteins your body uses
[02:53:12.860 --> 02:53:16.540]  them to make brain chemicals that make you feel alert and peaceful at the same
[02:53:16.540 --> 02:53:21.100]  time your pancreas uses them to regulate blood sugar and insulin people are
[02:53:21.100 --> 02:53:24.740]  waking up and doing an about face when it comes to nutrition they're learning
[02:53:24.740 --> 02:53:28.900]  that a high carbohydrate diet may encourage obesity and diabetes they
[02:53:28.900 --> 02:53:33.140]  are now emphasizing proteins more to compensate one protein source that is
[02:53:33.140 --> 02:53:37.900]  more easily broken down into amino acids is non-denatured whey protein for
[02:53:37.900 --> 02:53:42.140]  better blood sugar and better weight give one world way a try one world way is

[02:54:05.380 --> 02:54:10.140]  by the way in the just the last two years the White House has come out the
[02:54:10.140 --> 02:54:14.020]  council on farm relations has put out a geoengineering report saying yeah we've
[02:54:14.020 --> 02:54:18.620]  been doing testing all over North America spraying aluminum dioxide to
[02:54:18.620 --> 02:54:22.580]  create nuclei to protect us from global warming and we of course promote the
[02:54:22.580 --> 02:54:30.260]  film what the world are they spraying where it shows just incredible levels
[02:54:30.260 --> 02:54:35.100]  of aluminum dioxide increasing in in in areas all over the US and the soil we'll
[02:54:35.100 --> 02:54:39.420]  put the council on farm relations PDF back up you just search the term council
[02:54:39.420 --> 02:54:46.020]  on farm relations geoengineering and you'll be at the other own website where
[02:54:46.020 --> 02:54:50.460]  they admit this has been going on a guy got a Nobel Prize what a 92 for it and
[02:54:50.460 --> 02:54:53.300]  there's a huge program that we have the patents where it's mixed with the jet
[02:54:53.300 --> 02:54:56.640]  fuel or the companies the jetliner companies don't even know what they're
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:02.300]  doing it then disperses it by Dr. Blalock you were raising that during the
[02:55:02.300 --> 02:55:06.260]  break this is admitted to be going on but we're conspiracy theorists to talk
[02:55:06.260 --> 02:55:10.460]  about it well you know here's the thing just talking about pure science and
[02:55:10.460 --> 02:55:17.860]  ignoring the conspiracy part of it dropping a nano-sized aluminum from
[02:55:17.860 --> 02:55:25.340]  the atmosphere fills the air with this aluminum if you do that the aluminum is
[02:55:25.340 --> 02:55:31.540]  rapidly absorbed through the olfactory nerve the smell nerve in the nose enters
[02:55:31.540 --> 02:55:35.660]  the part of the brain it causes Alzheimer's disease as well as the lungs
[02:55:35.660 --> 02:55:42.540]  and the blood now I lectured on the fact of nano-sized aluminum versus regular
[02:55:42.540 --> 02:55:47.400]  aluminum at this meeting and I showed the literature clearly says nano-sized
[02:55:47.400 --> 02:55:52.420]  aluminum produces the intense brain inflammation and can produce all the
[02:55:52.420 --> 02:55:57.820]  changes in the brain that we see with Alzheimer's disease how if these idiots
[02:55:57.820 --> 02:56:03.820]  are saturating the atmosphere with aluminum that you're breathing every day
[02:56:03.820 --> 02:56:09.700]  in a nano-sized which I understand it is nano-sized you're gonna have an
[02:56:09.700 --> 02:56:17.060]  epidemic of degenerative brain disorders like we've never seen before and to do
[02:56:17.060 --> 02:56:23.180]  that over this mythology of global warming is just unbelievable also the
[02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:27.420]  nano-aluminum ends up in the soil the plant takes it up so when you eat the
[02:56:27.420 --> 02:56:32.460]  plant or the eat the meat from the cattle that's eating the plant you're
[02:56:32.460 --> 02:56:38.460]  getting high levels of nano-sized aluminum the fish everything they are
[02:56:38.460 --> 02:56:44.780]  poisoning the planet on an unprecedented scale if indeed they're doing this geo
[02:56:44.780 --> 02:56:48.780]  engineering which I think there's evidence as you said they aren't even
[02:56:48.780 --> 02:56:53.380]  admitted from what you said in the county absolutely if you just put into a
[02:56:53.380 --> 02:56:56.740]  search engine I mean even time magazines oh we've been doing tests
[02:56:56.740 --> 02:57:00.980]  secretly not to alarm you but now we're getting ready to go widespread spraying
[02:57:00.980 --> 02:57:06.700]  aluminum dioxide and barium salts on you to to shield out the radiation of
[02:57:06.700 --> 02:57:10.980]  the Sun because of global warming and then the scientists look at it and go
[02:57:10.980 --> 02:57:14.820]  but this will increase the heat of the earth and and absolutely they say it's
[02:57:14.820 --> 02:57:17.820]  secret testing but now they've declassified part of it well the
[02:57:17.820 --> 02:57:24.380]  neurological effects are just terrifying you know you walk outside you look at
[02:57:24.380 --> 02:57:29.700]  these chemtrails and they're all over Mississippi I'm just appalled this is
[02:57:29.700 --> 02:57:34.260]  gonna the people that already did in a pre Alzheimer's state they're gonna have
[02:57:34.260 --> 02:57:38.900]  rapidly advancing Alzheimer's young people the children are gonna get
[02:57:38.900 --> 02:57:42.620]  enormously high brain levels of aluminum in that part of the brain is
[02:57:42.620 --> 02:57:49.860]  defective there's no question about this is proven it's just insane
[02:57:49.860 --> 02:57:54.660]  absolutely well it's been improved it's been proven that all over the country
[02:57:54.660 --> 02:57:59.660]  levels are going off the chart in the soil right but yeah I watched the video
[02:57:59.660 --> 02:58:03.900]  and then Hawaii and biologists have measured the aluminum levels and they
[02:58:03.900 --> 02:58:08.700]  noticed over the last several years it's just progressively increasing at an
[02:58:08.700 --> 02:58:13.620]  enormous rate so you're gonna have trouble finding food to eat that's not
[02:58:13.620 --> 02:58:16.820]  full of aluminum but don't worry Monsanto's coming out with a whole line
[02:58:16.820 --> 02:58:20.300]  of aluminum-resistant plants
[02:58:20.300 --> 02:58:25.820]  but you know if you talk about conspiracy you have two alternatives
[02:58:25.820 --> 02:58:31.460]  either there's a conspiracy for population control or these people are so
[02:58:31.460 --> 02:58:36.260]  stupid they should be instituted a lot that's your only choice and either way
[02:58:36.260 --> 02:58:39.660]  the same thing it's hurting us we'll be right back in one minute with dr.
[02:58:39.660 --> 02:58:54.220]  Blaylock this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[02:58:54.220 --> 02:58:58.700]  a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[02:58:58.700 --> 02:59:02.860]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[02:59:02.860 --> 02:59:06.900]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[02:59:06.900 --> 02:59:10.780]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[02:59:10.780 --> 02:59:15.060]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:59:15.060 --> 02:59:19.220]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:59:19.220 --> 02:59:23.540]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:59:23.540 --> 02:59:27.260]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[02:59:27.260 --> 02:59:31.460]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[02:59:31.460 --> 02:59:34.860]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[02:59:34.860 --> 02:59:38.460]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[02:59:38.460 --> 02:59:44.100]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[02:59:44.100 --> 02:59:51.300]  doesn't own the Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[02:59:51.300 --> 02:59:57.580]  coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[02:59:57.580 --> 03:00:26.940]  Broadcasting Network network
[03:00:26.940 --> 03:00:37.020]  alright final five minutes is Dr. Russell Blalock MD you know sitting here
[03:00:37.020 --> 03:00:40.060]  listening to him I've noticed traveling around the country I've been able to
[03:00:40.060 --> 03:00:43.860]  pull up satellite photos of the entire nation and then blow it up from an
[03:00:43.860 --> 03:00:47.980]  average day the chemtrails are mainly over US cities these aren't like the
[03:00:47.980 --> 03:00:52.220]  old con trails that dissipated in a minute or so I mean they sit there all
[03:00:52.220 --> 03:00:55.180]  day they turn into cloud banks and now they admit oh there's been a lot of
[03:00:55.180 --> 03:01:00.380]  secret testing with this high altitude you know passive aerosol spraying
[03:01:00.380 --> 03:01:04.340]  campaign but we're doing it for your own good to protect the earth and then I
[03:01:04.340 --> 03:01:08.100]  notice that there are certain areas the country where they're not doing it and
[03:01:08.100 --> 03:01:12.260]  you notice those are the areas like Wyoming in places where the globalists
[03:01:12.260 --> 03:01:17.740]  are all moving and trying to stay it is beyond evil that this is happening and
[03:01:17.740 --> 03:01:21.620]  when they're chemtrailing heavily my grandmother's lived here all her life
[03:01:21.620 --> 03:01:25.460]  never had allergies had them it's not allergies folks it's brain inflammation
[03:01:25.460 --> 03:01:28.540]  when they're chemtrailing heavily in the middle of the summer at 2,000 feet
[03:01:28.540 --> 03:01:32.940]  ice crystals are impossible there everybody gets sick everybody's got
[03:01:32.940 --> 03:01:38.380]  headaches and because they're spraying us and I think it's very funny and now
[03:01:38.380 --> 03:01:42.660]  you heard dr. Blalock 25 30 year olds getting Alzheimer's it's very funny to
[03:01:42.660 --> 03:01:46.700]  them and it's very enjoyable to these control freaks these eugenicists dr.
[03:01:46.700 --> 03:01:50.580]  Blalock finishing up also they've raised the federal government has the
[03:01:50.580 --> 03:01:54.580]  level of radiation they say is safe they've reported more explosions and
[03:01:54.580 --> 03:01:59.260]  smoke at Fukushima but that's not even in our news it's drifting over here and
[03:01:59.260 --> 03:02:02.780]  you've also put out a paper dealing with some of the nutritional things folks
[03:02:02.780 --> 03:02:08.660]  can do to protect themselves from this low-level radiation exposure I wrote an
[03:02:08.660 --> 03:02:14.900]  e-booklet which goes into detail about how to protect yourself it was originally
[03:02:14.900 --> 03:02:20.860]  written about nuclear terrorism but it applies to medical radiation or this
[03:02:20.860 --> 03:02:26.900]  event but what I did I spent a good deal of time researching primarily through
[03:02:26.900 --> 03:02:31.740]  NASA research NASA does most of the research on radio protection how to
[03:02:31.740 --> 03:02:37.900]  protect yourself it rarely enters the general discussion everybody talks
[03:02:37.900 --> 03:02:41.420]  about what you need iodine tablets and all that kind of all I don't know is
[03:02:41.420 --> 03:02:50.300]  protection thyroid these very dangerous isotopes like cesium 134 137
[03:02:50.300 --> 03:02:54.620]  stronium 90 they don't they can last in the body because they incorporated in the
[03:02:54.620 --> 03:03:00.100]  bone entire lifetime and they're have life 30 years so your entire life you'll
[03:03:00.100 --> 03:03:05.060]  be radiated internally and that's what happened Chernobyl well when I look
[03:03:05.060 --> 03:03:08.660]  through what they did in Chernobyl the American doctors going over there
[03:03:08.660 --> 03:03:15.100]  treating them they used a lot of supplements for instance in Chernobyl
[03:03:15.100 --> 03:03:19.540]  use alphalopoic acid found just dramatic protection of these people
[03:03:19.540 --> 03:03:26.060]  reversals of some of these effect when they looked at the NASA studies they'll
[03:03:26.060 --> 03:03:30.380]  take animals and expose them to doses of gamma radiation they'll kill the
[03:03:30.380 --> 03:03:37.220]  animals within 24 hours or less and for instance with ginger just the extract
[03:03:37.220 --> 03:03:42.260]  ginger they found that if you gave it five days before the lethal dose of
[03:03:42.260 --> 03:03:48.580]  gamma radiation they found enormous protection over 60 70% of the animals
[03:03:48.580 --> 03:03:54.620]  were alive they were given the ginger all of them died it didn't get it so with
[03:03:54.620 --> 03:04:01.140]  even enormously high levels these flavonoids are highly protected what's
[03:04:01.140 --> 03:04:06.660]  the number of them curcumin resveratrol quercetin all of these are
[03:04:06.660 --> 03:04:12.140]  enormously radio protective for instance they did a study on breast
[03:04:12.140 --> 03:04:17.380]  exposed to radiation and found out if you gave curcumin they reduced the
[03:04:17.380 --> 03:04:24.380]  incidence of radiation induced breast cancer by 70% which is any far more
[03:04:24.380 --> 03:04:29.620]  protection than any known drug and now we see I saw this in the news last week
[03:04:29.620 --> 03:04:34.140]  the UN Codex Alimentarius has gone into Europe they're banning hundreds above
[03:04:34.140 --> 03:04:37.860]  the counter minerals and vitamins because Big Pharma knows it's their
[03:04:37.860 --> 03:04:43.180]  competition well yeah and if you start banning these things that it can protect
[03:04:43.180 --> 03:04:47.900]  you against these toxins that's going to increase the mortality in the disease
[03:04:47.900 --> 03:04:52.580]  rate present within the chemtrails the aluminum well folks can find that report
[03:04:52.580 --> 03:04:58.300]  well at your website and that's a laylock wellness center calm thank you so

[03:06:28.780 --> 03:06:33.180]  men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an
[03:06:33.180 --> 03:06:37.140]  oppressive world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing
[03:06:37.140 --> 03:06:40.620]  short of a world constitution for the global financial system global
[03:06:40.620 --> 03:06:45.100]  governance with the establishment of the G-20 so it's going to be an inner ruling elite

[03:07:04.540 --> 03:07:09.220]  a naturopathic physician doc asks why does the United States spend more money
[03:07:09.220 --> 03:07:14.460]  on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide he
[03:07:14.460 --> 03:07:18.180]  believes that people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of
[03:07:18.180 --> 03:07:22.500]  nutrition taking charge of their life and attain optimal health and longevity
[03:07:22.500 --> 03:07:26.500]  through nutrition not by toxic prescription drugs leading to side

[03:08:16.940 --> 03:08:24.740]  lotten hoax and then I'm going to get into all the news surrounding this and
[03:08:24.740 --> 03:08:34.140]  the domestic checkpoints the internal passport system that's being rolled out
[03:08:34.140 --> 03:08:43.220]  and also the big prison planet dot com info wars dot com report the 10 facts
[03:08:43.220 --> 03:08:47.540]  that prove that the whole been lotten situation is a hoax let me give you the
[03:08:47.540 --> 03:08:53.300]  exact headline 10 facts that prove the been lotten fable is a contrived hoax
[03:08:53.300 --> 03:09:02.060]  we're gonna be reading over that al qaeda though one of the propaganda centers
[03:09:02.060 --> 03:09:07.820]  admittedly connected to the pentagon al qaeda confirms that been lotten was
[03:09:07.820 --> 03:09:13.540]  killed and and notice al qaeda always pops up at key election time or at key
[03:09:13.540 --> 03:09:18.620]  times for diversions coinciding with the announcements of governor ridge or
[03:09:18.620 --> 03:09:23.660]  ashcroft before him or now jenna polatano of a terror threat al qaeda puts
[03:09:23.660 --> 03:09:27.780]  out announcements agreeing it'll just be on a message board or an audio and
[03:09:27.780 --> 03:09:31.180]  everybody says it's real and it's a government that's been caught putting
[03:09:31.180 --> 03:09:36.420]  out fake reports over and over again I mean do we forget that they've been caught
[03:09:36.420 --> 03:09:39.860]  lying to us over and over again but there's one more point I want to add
[03:09:39.860 --> 03:09:43.580]  about that hour-long interview we just did with dr. Russell blalock you know a
[03:09:43.580 --> 03:09:48.780]  top retired brain surgeon whose literature has entered the main scientific
[03:09:48.780 --> 03:09:56.420]  body of work terms he coined surgeries he invented and I've flown the guys out
[03:09:56.420 --> 03:10:00.420]  to big events to interview him for upcoming film and it's also already
[03:10:00.420 --> 03:10:04.540]  posted at prison planet dot TV unedited just the whole interview and they've
[03:10:04.540 --> 03:10:09.460]  flown out to events every week he's speaking at giant events packed full of
[03:10:09.460 --> 03:10:14.180]  medical doctors and other top medical doctors this stuff is starting to get
[03:10:14.180 --> 03:10:21.900]  out and you hurting this is a contrived system to reduce population or these
[03:10:21.900 --> 03:10:26.460]  people are complete nuts well how do they with such precision come out with
[03:10:26.460 --> 03:10:30.420]  things that attack the heart attack the liver attack the brain and tell you it's
[03:10:30.420 --> 03:10:35.900]  for the cardiovascular system how do they come out with a Gardasil shot that
[03:10:35.900 --> 03:10:41.140]  almost no women die of cervical cancer a year those that do you usually have an
[03:10:41.140 --> 03:10:48.100]  autoimmune problem 3,000 on average a year contracted even less die generally
[03:10:48.100 --> 03:10:53.060]  it's very simple surgery it's almost like skin cancer generally it's women who
[03:10:53.060 --> 03:10:57.100]  are prostitutes and and and drug users and have had literally thousands of
[03:10:57.100 --> 03:11:01.500]  partners the point is the drug insert for Gardasil says this doesn't
[03:11:01.500 --> 03:11:07.300]  necessarily protect you it's only six of the known strains the strains are in
[03:11:07.300 --> 03:11:14.220]  300 plus that can kill you and in the total thousands and always mutating but
[03:11:14.220 --> 03:11:18.860]  it certainly has killed well in the trials it killed 20-something young
[03:11:18.860 --> 03:11:23.140]  girls and every week or two I see another article out of Kansas or Texas or
[03:11:23.140 --> 03:11:27.620]  California it's always the cheerleader mama says I'm gonna give it to my girl
[03:11:27.620 --> 03:11:30.940]  we're feminist they take her because you're told be a feminist give her the
[03:11:30.940 --> 03:11:36.420]  shot let her have you know have sex or whatever and they march her down there
[03:11:36.420 --> 03:11:39.300]  and they give her that shot and boy she's paralyzed blood starts pouring out
[03:11:39.300 --> 03:11:44.500]  she's dead and the doctor finally reads the insert and goes yeah the shot
[03:11:44.500 --> 03:11:47.860]  killed your daughter and everybody buries her and you know it's kind of a
[03:11:47.860 --> 03:11:54.580]  celebration and don't worry is 25 year olds get Alzheimer's and as everybody
[03:11:54.580 --> 03:11:59.260]  starts dying they'll have diabetes runs and cancer runs and Alzheimer runs and
[03:11:59.260 --> 03:12:02.900]  it'll all be fashionable the local leaders they're having dinners for the
[03:12:02.900 --> 03:12:07.980]  research that's given to big pharma and to finance murdering us these are
[03:12:07.980 --> 03:12:14.340]  murdering killers let me tell you something cop swat team guys if I came
[03:12:14.340 --> 03:12:18.140]  in blue aluminum dust in your face you would know that aluminum's connected
[03:12:18.140 --> 03:12:21.740]  Alzheimer's that's been admitted for 30 years you'd probably beat me down and
[03:12:21.740 --> 03:12:27.180]  take me to jail I deserve it a grand jury would probably indict me for
[03:12:27.180 --> 03:12:35.220]  assaulting an officer but the Department of Energy for at least 16 years just
[03:12:35.220 --> 03:12:41.100]  just go search geoengineering testing the dozens and dozens of patents to add
[03:12:41.100 --> 03:12:45.020]  it to the jet fuel where the companies aren't even conscious of what's
[03:12:45.020 --> 03:12:48.580]  happening just here's the new federal policy add this aluminum dioxide to it
[03:12:48.580 --> 03:12:56.220]  the engines dispersant it creates nuclei fact BBC NASA earth now 20% darker
[03:12:56.220 --> 03:13:01.100]  boom global dimming hit them with global dimming caused by contrails but these
[03:13:01.100 --> 03:13:07.340]  aren't contrails these are chemtrails and it is the aerosol testing campaign
[03:13:07.340 --> 03:13:13.420]  and you can't lie major universities city health departments that aren't
[03:13:13.420 --> 03:13:18.780]  totally controlled all over a reporting 10 2030 I'm getting chills right now 50
[03:13:18.780 --> 03:13:23.940]  times safe levels of aluminum it's just appearing out of nowhere there's not a
[03:13:23.940 --> 03:13:29.780]  factory nearby it's coming down on us we're breathing it they're killing us
[03:13:29.780 --> 03:13:34.620]  of course University professors say I've been teaching for 50 years and these
[03:13:34.620 --> 03:13:43.940]  kids are dumb the IQ has dropped we're being murdered military police news
[03:13:43.940 --> 03:13:50.460]  people government people we're all in this together we're all under attack it's
[03:13:50.460 --> 03:13:57.300]  the scientific dictatorship that in the 70s had space planes with
[03:13:57.300 --> 03:14:01.420]  decapitation weapons to kill the entire global leadership in one hour
[03:14:01.420 --> 03:14:05.980]  dr. Bob Bowman told me that all the reason you could talk about it was
[03:14:05.980 --> 03:14:11.300]  because in a c-span debate about Star Wars program the current head of it over
[03:14:11.300 --> 03:14:15.500]  the decade ago screwed up and started talking about classified and Bowman
[03:14:15.500 --> 03:14:18.660]  looked at him and said now I can talk about it you just talked about it in a
[03:14:18.660 --> 03:14:24.100]  public forum I got turned red and freaked out I mean you think that
[03:14:24.100 --> 03:14:27.900]  helicopter the crash and the fake bin Laden thing was high-tech that things
[03:14:27.900 --> 03:14:33.740]  probably 40 years old that they had stealth bomber designs in the 40s
[03:14:33.740 --> 03:14:38.820]  ladies and gentlemen we're not in Kansas anymore the decision has been made
[03:14:38.820 --> 03:14:43.780]  that the earth is infested with too many humans and the decision has been made
[03:14:43.780 --> 03:14:49.840]  to see if they can slowly poison us slowly kill us degenerate us take our
[03:14:49.840 --> 03:14:53.580]  savings transfer it to them as we die with their treatments it's all
[03:14:53.580 --> 03:14:58.180]  compartmentalized this is the plan and then you wonder if the bin Laden videos
[03:14:58.180 --> 03:15:03.140]  fake again the only reason I mentioned this because it came out in the news
[03:15:03.140 --> 03:15:08.940]  last year Hillary apologized for the UN and the US government shooting kids up
[03:15:08.940 --> 03:15:14.580]  with live syphilis it wasn't just black people 30 40 years ago it's everybody
[03:15:14.580 --> 03:15:20.540]  let's see white folks go them blacks and gave them a shot and gave them what they
[03:15:20.540 --> 03:15:25.660]  deserve there's too many of them I can't tell you how many yuppies go to
[03:15:25.660 --> 03:15:29.580]  universities they go well there aren't too many people mr. Jones listen scumbag
[03:15:29.580 --> 03:15:36.900]  you want to be psychopath you're being hit with it to you demide snot nose piece
[03:15:36.900 --> 03:15:43.180]  of trash I don't like being sprayed I don't like GMO and that trying to have
[03:15:43.180 --> 03:15:48.580]  to avoid it I'm sick of it I don't like being assaulted and I don't like
[03:15:48.580 --> 03:15:54.900]  gibbering dumb-down people out there who serve the system and get all threatened
[03:15:54.900 --> 03:15:59.180]  by a summer bin Laden because he looks like a goofball and he's the enemy you
[03:15:59.180 --> 03:16:02.940]  need to figure out the scientific dictatorship if I make the claim that the
[03:16:02.940 --> 03:16:08.260]  White House science are published books calling to add sterile into the water
[03:16:08.700 --> 03:16:16.620]  sodium fluoride then you should go look it up and find out I told you the truth
[03:16:16.620 --> 03:16:22.500]  you shouldn't just say this guy's a nut no I'm not the nut if you don't at least
[03:16:22.500 --> 03:16:28.740]  look into this info and find out it's true you are the nut and I remember
[03:16:28.740 --> 03:16:32.420]  going to college I remember that's why I got out of college all it was was how the
[03:16:32.420 --> 03:16:41.180]  family's bad the Second Amendment's bad Christians are bad white people are bad
[03:16:41.180 --> 03:16:44.980]  but that was only done so white folks who were quote the dominant group at the
[03:16:44.980 --> 03:16:48.660]  time would feel guilty and then okay you're bad but you do what the government
[03:16:48.660 --> 03:16:52.500]  tells you now and so now you're a liberal see they teach you you're guilty
[03:16:52.500 --> 03:16:56.620]  you're bad okay what do I do not be guilty you turn in your guns you hate the
[03:16:56.620 --> 03:17:01.660]  family you do whatever you're told yes I'm a trendy you mutilate yourself yes
[03:17:01.660 --> 03:17:05.780]  I'll do that you know it's just what I'll do whatever you say you don't take
[03:17:05.780 --> 03:17:12.820]  baths you drop out of society yes I'll do that that will show them see that's
[03:17:12.820 --> 03:17:16.460]  what Madison Avenue does they make you feel inadequate and then they sell you
[03:17:16.460 --> 03:17:22.380]  what'll make you adequate I'll go on these syndicated predominantly black
[03:17:22.380 --> 03:17:27.340]  talk shows and they'll sit there and ask me well we like what you say but you
[03:17:27.340 --> 03:17:30.940]  know bottom line do you not like Obama because you're racist and I'll just say
[03:17:30.940 --> 03:17:34.220]  you know what let's just say I'm racist okay that's why I'm against a boarding
[03:17:34.220 --> 03:17:39.460]  52% of all blacks I'm against the fact that 52% of blacks in the loom are
[03:17:39.460 --> 03:17:49.900]  killed before they're born since 73 and I'll be like oh oh you see that's the
[03:17:49.900 --> 03:17:54.700]  big litmus test I mean am I mad at some black groups that get all hyped up and
[03:17:54.700 --> 03:17:58.500]  they call the problems in the world are whitey am I threatened by that yeah but
[03:17:58.500 --> 03:18:02.140]  I don't dislike you as an individual I'd rather free your mind and have you right
[03:18:02.140 --> 03:18:07.500]  beside me believe me I'm way past what color your skin is and and so whites
[03:18:07.500 --> 03:18:13.260]  have this victimology of the black thing going so the whites are guilty but
[03:18:13.260 --> 03:18:20.380]  then meanwhile they get behind Planned Parenthood fundraisers you know oh look
[03:18:20.380 --> 03:18:26.020]  at this for a few weeks ago the so-called the so-called trendy magazine
[03:18:26.020 --> 03:18:33.060]  weekly here in Austin completely untrendy and it says toxic shock how the
[03:18:33.060 --> 03:18:36.980]  attack on Planned Parenthood is poisoning women's health care set up by
[03:18:36.980 --> 03:18:44.260]  Margaret Sanger to quote get rid of black weeds and I have interviewed black
[03:18:44.260 --> 03:18:50.140]  nationals well-known you know black guys black guys first we're gonna say the
[03:18:50.140 --> 03:18:54.180]  black people now say what about abortion and they look at you straight up and go
[03:18:54.180 --> 03:18:59.220]  well I support it and I say you support Margaret Sanger who said we got to get
[03:18:59.220 --> 03:19:04.220]  black leaders behind this abortion so we can kill these subhuman weeds oh see
[03:19:04.220 --> 03:19:09.820]  it's toxic shock you got to stand up for women's rights nothing more demonic
[03:19:09.820 --> 03:19:15.540]  nothing more evil I mean once you once you buy into 51 million dead babies 52
[03:19:15.540 --> 03:19:20.060]  percent of blacks being stare having their babies killed and it's a right it's
[03:19:20.060 --> 03:19:26.300]  a good thing kill them babies and then they put a skull with it with a woman's
[03:19:26.300 --> 03:19:31.540]  long hair coming out of it who shows that she's she's pregnant so the image
[03:19:31.540 --> 03:19:38.820]  is pregnant is death life is death so this is an oxymoron this is 1984 two
[03:19:38.820 --> 03:19:44.980]  plus two equals a hundred this is up is down down is up life is death life is bad

[03:20:05.020 --> 03:20:09.380]  experienced emergencies and disasters and unprecedented numbers people have
[03:20:09.380 --> 03:20:13.300]  had to literally run for their lives folks this is Steve shank with the food
[03:20:13.300 --> 03:20:17.500]  direct I'm not here to scare you but when disaster strikes you won't have
[03:20:17.500 --> 03:20:21.460]  time to think you must act automatically what does the pilot do when the
[03:20:21.460 --> 03:20:26.500]  helicopter engine fails in flight no time to think just act automatically when
[03:20:26.500 --> 03:20:30.740]  the alert is broadcast the alarm sounds or the knock comes on your door you'll
[03:20:30.740 --> 03:20:35.100]  need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need you need

[03:33:00.340 --> 03:33:08.700]  last night I heard Obama was coming to Texas for a whirlwind tour collecting
[03:33:08.700 --> 03:33:13.740]  money but I didn't know he was coming to Austin now we're just giving this from
[03:33:13.740 --> 03:33:19.780]  KXAN Obama to visit Austin for fundraiser senators ask him to review
[03:33:19.780 --> 03:33:26.780]  wildfire devastation and it says he's going to be at the W Hotel down on 4
[03:33:26.780 --> 03:33:32.860]  Street and so there's the details of that and I could go down there and
[03:33:32.860 --> 03:33:37.140]  bullhorn him tomorrow but probably with the establishment would do would have
[03:33:37.140 --> 03:33:40.940]  so-called Patriots go get a permit for it then if I was five blocks away trying
[03:33:40.940 --> 03:33:44.300]  to bullhorn they'll run over and say stop I'm not allowed to protest in Austin
[03:33:44.300 --> 03:33:48.140]  even if it's an event I told people to go to but I got a little paranoid about
[03:33:48.140 --> 03:33:57.100]  that that's how they do that but so be it I had plans tomorrow at five but I
[03:33:57.100 --> 03:34:01.980]  may have to cancel those and get down there it's 5 to 6 p.m. KXAN news will
[03:34:01.980 --> 03:34:06.100]  have live coverage of the president's visit tomorrow to Austin Texas we'll
[03:34:06.100 --> 03:34:10.220]  get this report a link to this report up on info wars.com and
[03:34:10.220 --> 03:34:15.140]  prisonplanet.com and let me explain something I don't get permits the state
[03:34:15.140 --> 03:34:18.580]  of Texas and the city of Austin have lost a bunch of lawsuits over trying
[03:34:18.580 --> 03:34:22.340]  arresting folks for having permits to protest as long as you're not blocking
[03:34:22.340 --> 03:34:25.900]  a road you don't need a stinking permit and I think everybody should be down
[03:34:25.900 --> 03:34:31.300]  there tomorrow and not let them urge it five blocks down the road you know
[03:34:31.300 --> 03:34:35.180]  behind a little gate and tell you that's where you stay when Vicente Fox came
[03:34:35.180 --> 03:34:39.380]  to town I bullhorn him at point blank range at the governor's mansion I if I
[03:34:39.380 --> 03:34:42.620]  go down there and I'm strongly considering it I'm not gonna have these
[03:34:42.620 --> 03:34:46.900]  stinking permits now that turns a right into a privilege I protest the police
[03:34:46.900 --> 03:34:51.220]  department I don't get a permit okay then I'll send a big crowd down there
[03:34:51.220 --> 03:34:54.740]  and then Lord knows what will happen but I'm probably gonna go down there
[03:34:54.740 --> 03:34:59.620]  tomorrow night so that's important information right there because he needs
[03:34:59.620 --> 03:35:05.140]  to be exposed on this whole bin Laden hoax but President Obama will arrive in
[03:35:05.140 --> 03:35:08.420]  Austin Tuesday evening he first visit I'll pass what I give a speech on
[03:35:08.420 --> 03:35:12.380]  immigration that's the big one for the total amnesty he will head to Austin to
[03:35:12.380 --> 03:35:16.060]  attend a fundraiser for 2012 presidential campaign the private event
[03:35:16.060 --> 03:35:23.900]  will be held at ACL live at the Moody theater hosted in the W Hotel at 310
[03:35:23.900 --> 03:35:28.140]  West Willie Nelson Boulevard while seeking a money from people of Texas
[03:35:28.140 --> 03:35:31.740]  last week the Obama administration denied a request to declare a disaster in
[03:35:31.740 --> 03:35:35.220]  Texas because of wildfires which would make the state eligible for federal
[03:35:35.220 --> 03:35:39.380]  funds Friday both senators from Texas asked the president to turn the state's
[03:35:39.380 --> 03:35:44.020]  wildfire damage while he's here so there you go begging for our own money back
[03:35:44.020 --> 03:35:47.860]  all right let's go to your calls I gotta move quick now Tim finishing up the
[03:35:47.860 --> 03:35:55.140]  point you were making okay this is it Alex between you and I I'm also the guy
[03:35:55.140 --> 03:36:02.740]  that called in about I went on the fourth of July and passed out the copies of the
[03:36:02.740 --> 03:36:08.060]  Bill of Rights and I don't remember me calling and telling you about that and
[03:36:08.060 --> 03:36:14.180]  there's a search search term info bomb and then I also was the one that called
[03:36:14.180 --> 03:36:19.340]  and talked to you directly to the Michigan militia after they they rated
[03:36:19.340 --> 03:36:25.380]  her Atari and told you that it they were graded awake that was also me but
[03:36:25.380 --> 03:36:30.620]  here and then we had you both had agreed on the man we picked out as the Fed
[03:36:30.620 --> 03:36:37.180]  condition get breaking down where I'm getting to okay now I single-handedly
[03:36:37.180 --> 03:36:43.980]  now you're gonna love this man check this out I single-handedly by myself by
[03:36:43.980 --> 03:36:48.900]  doing a few simple things because we're tanned I hear a lot of people talking I
[03:36:48.900 --> 03:36:53.100]  don't know what to do I don't know what to do what can I do what can I do start
[03:36:53.100 --> 03:36:57.860]  taking action go to city council and speak calling to talk radio start your
[03:36:57.860 --> 03:37:02.060]  own organization all of us by ourselves doing a little bit will bring the
[03:37:02.060 --> 03:37:08.140]  globalist to their knees that's what I did listen I used their own document to
[03:37:08.140 --> 03:37:13.700]  hang them what I did is I got a copy of your annual drinking report drinking
[03:37:13.700 --> 03:37:20.180]  water report and the first thing that's listed on here Alex one of the things
[03:37:20.180 --> 03:37:24.380]  that really shocks me is I don't know if you've seen that commercial about out of
[03:37:24.380 --> 03:37:29.940]  every hundred children will eventually develop autism baby I mean that's an
[03:37:29.940 --> 03:37:33.220]  extremely a large amount of number whether it's the fluoride or the
[03:37:33.220 --> 03:37:37.660]  vaccinations I don't know it's all of it this is a scientific dick
[03:37:37.660 --> 03:37:41.300]  dictatorship and that's what's going on but anyway the point is you went to your
[03:37:41.300 --> 03:37:46.860]  city council to fight fluoridation and you had their own document no no they
[03:37:46.860 --> 03:37:52.860]  they sent me off they sent me the correct document and the first thing on
[03:37:52.860 --> 03:37:59.300]  the list was the term regulated contaminant and underneath it says
[03:37:59.300 --> 03:38:05.860]  fluoride now regulated contaminant means how much contaminant we put in the water
[03:38:05.860 --> 03:38:09.380]  if you want to break down the lame no no you're right they call it a
[03:38:09.380 --> 03:38:13.860]  contaminant it's what it is and then yeah and then and then it says level
[03:38:13.860 --> 03:38:21.060]  detected 1.1 so I refer over to so my speech which I verified every single
[03:38:21.060 --> 03:38:28.100]  resource well now the fans have had to say cut it down to 0.7 or 0 0 they've
[03:38:28.100 --> 03:38:34.340]  cut it from one point what one point two part per million to down to seven so
[03:38:34.340 --> 03:38:39.420]  they've cut it almost by half and that's because they admit all the bone
[03:38:39.420 --> 03:38:43.020]  cancer increasing but but Tim I love hearing from him but we've got to jump
[03:38:43.020 --> 03:38:47.580]  to other callers so you're saying you you hung them with it did you go to a
[03:38:47.580 --> 03:38:50.820]  meeting what did you do with the information I went to a meeting I wrote
[03:38:50.820 --> 03:39:00.980]  a speech I posted the flyers all over town and when I turn I called talk to the
[03:39:00.980 --> 03:39:04.100]  guy at the water department he said you know we've been getting a lot of calls
[03:39:04.100 --> 03:39:08.540]  this week I don't I'm wondering why you know well me my girlfriend it went past
[03:39:08.540 --> 03:39:13.620]  in downtown with one of your flyer that you did the yellow one yes and then I
[03:39:13.620 --> 03:39:19.100]  and then I knew you went up on my own you know and this is how I hung up it says
[03:39:19.100 --> 03:39:26.780]  levels detected 1.1 part per million but in my in my research that is also
[03:39:26.780 --> 03:39:32.940]  backed up it says amounts below one part per million they seriously depressed the
[03:39:32.940 --> 03:39:38.300]  ability of white blood cells to destroy pathogenic agents I use their own
[03:39:38.300 --> 03:39:45.740]  numbers and my research to hang these people I also gave them a copy of Dr.
[03:39:45.740 --> 03:39:51.060]  Kennedy's dangers of fluoride speech I burned a bunch of them and it goes out
[03:39:51.060 --> 03:39:59.660]  and two weeks later I get a call from the water board I've got ABC NBC and CBS
[03:39:59.660 --> 03:40:08.660]  and two major newspapers on May 16th that's on a on a Monday of May want to
[03:40:08.660 --> 03:40:14.500]  interview me and I gotta jump Tim but another example Tim calling in with the
[03:40:14.500 --> 03:40:19.500]  Google bomb info bomb idea reach tens of millions in the city where he lives I'm
[03:40:19.500 --> 03:40:21.700]  meant to ask you what city Tim he's still there
[03:40:21.700 --> 03:40:27.820]  out Clemens Michigan Mount Clemens Michigan others Clemens people should
[03:40:27.820 --> 03:40:32.420]  join you and get involved God bless an example look I'm just a normal guy who
[03:40:32.420 --> 03:40:37.100]  who got mad at the globalist 17 years ago and took action really about 19 years
[03:40:37.100 --> 03:40:42.100]  ago but took me a few years to get on air the point is if you if you have the
[03:40:42.100 --> 03:40:47.980]  truth and you don't stop you can't be beaten okay and we have the facts and
[03:40:47.980 --> 03:40:52.020]  we're not gonna stop and that's why the globalists haven't killed me because they
[03:40:52.020 --> 03:40:57.100]  know the ideas are bulletproof and all it will do is underline and highlight
[03:40:57.100 --> 03:41:01.860]  everything I've said and done in fact it's now time for you to do it it's now
[03:41:01.860 --> 03:41:07.260]  time for you to lead I might show up I might not but the point is everybody
[03:41:07.260 --> 03:41:10.580]  should go down and protest Obama tomorrow and everywhere else he goes you
[03:41:10.580 --> 03:41:14.260]  should print up this article by the hundreds and hand it out ten facts that
[03:41:14.260 --> 03:41:20.060]  prove bin Laden's fable as a contrived hoax hand these out to everybody the
[03:41:20.060 --> 03:41:23.420]  media will pick it up they will cover it it's not like I need to go down there
[03:41:23.420 --> 03:41:26.380]  to get in the media I can go make a five-minute YouTube video today and we'll
[03:41:26.380 --> 03:41:33.980]  get 700 to a 700,000 a million views I'm just a prisoner of how much media we
[03:41:33.980 --> 03:41:39.020]  can get control of it it's just I'm not even worthy for this I don't even want
[03:41:39.020 --> 03:41:43.140]  to be near the police and the and the and the fawning over the president I
[03:41:43.140 --> 03:41:51.340]  may actually go down there to Marcus I don't want to go down there I just don't
[03:41:51.340 --> 03:41:54.380]  want an Austin cop coming over to me and saying you're not allowed to protest and
[03:41:54.380 --> 03:41:57.900]  I have to tell him go ahead and arrest me I'm gonna have to personally sue you
[03:41:57.900 --> 03:42:02.340]  it'll just be some poor fluoride head cop probably already got major brain
[03:42:02.340 --> 03:42:06.980]  damage from the chemtrails and you want to look at them you know I mean at a
[03:42:06.980 --> 03:42:11.740]  certain point folks I've been doing this so long and so much that I just can't
[03:42:11.740 --> 03:42:16.620]  handle it anymore I just can't I mean at a certain point I can I just can't
[03:42:16.620 --> 03:42:22.020]  even look at these people and and and the way they'll have all the police fire
[03:42:22.020 --> 03:42:27.860]  engines and and and cop cars honoring this criminal and and hyping it up like
[03:42:27.860 --> 03:42:31.740]  he actually runs something you know all the pomp and circumstance around the
[03:42:31.740 --> 03:42:35.820]  president is about diverting you onto the president to think he runs something
[03:42:35.820 --> 03:42:39.660]  instead of the big bankers that really run this country all right I just spent
[03:42:39.660 --> 03:42:45.340]  15 minutes for that caller Janice in Michigan you're on the air hi Alex can
[03:42:45.340 --> 03:42:50.220]  you hear me I'm okay yeah I can hear you go ahead okay I changed my name to
[03:42:50.220 --> 03:42:55.540]  patients well I knew like a lot of days just not even open the phones you know I
[03:42:55.540 --> 03:43:00.740]  know anyway I had one question when you open the lines for the bin Laden
[03:43:00.740 --> 03:43:04.500]  caper yeah in fact maybe I should just take calls tomorrow just on that subject
[03:43:04.500 --> 03:43:08.860]  go ahead yeah okay so that's what I called in about and I had one question
[03:43:08.860 --> 03:43:13.780]  and it turned into five because I've been thinking and I'm just gonna instead of
[03:43:13.780 --> 03:43:17.540]  waiting for you to respond or for your answers I'm just going to blurt the
[03:43:17.540 --> 03:43:22.220]  questions out number one I'm not a military expert but I'd like to know why
[03:43:22.220 --> 03:43:27.980]  they're telling us they use the Navy SEALs because I thought they were divers
[03:43:27.980 --> 03:43:32.380]  and had to do with water and I don't know maybe we can ask Jesse Ventura but
[03:43:32.380 --> 03:43:36.980]  I don't know where there's water around Pakistan or how that would fit in now
[03:43:36.980 --> 03:43:42.220]  they started out as underwater demolition teams D-Day and the Atlantic and
[03:43:42.220 --> 03:43:46.900]  the Pacific with the Japanese that was expanded to the Navy SEALs they have
[03:43:46.900 --> 03:43:49.860]  subgroups the underwater demolition teams that deal with the water stuff
[03:43:49.860 --> 03:43:54.580]  mainly but all of them are trained to be able to operate on land air sea
[03:43:54.580 --> 03:43:59.660]  everything and they're you know of the special operations groups they're one
[03:43:59.660 --> 03:44:05.580]  of the oldest and most prestigious and so they do operate on land green berets
[03:44:05.580 --> 03:44:10.340]  also probably or anything they all do they all do all I'm just saying Navy SEALs
[03:44:10.340 --> 03:44:14.460]  sounds suspect to me there's no water around Pakistan the second question was
[03:44:14.460 --> 03:44:20.140]  the Pakistan compound was it surrounded by US government buildings and military
[03:44:20.140 --> 03:44:25.380]  buildings I thought I heard something so that you know that points to an inside
[03:44:25.380 --> 03:44:30.420]  job or whatever or inside or type information it was in the middle of a
[03:44:30.420 --> 03:44:37.220]  controlled military area where they have no it Pakistani but they also there
[03:44:37.220 --> 03:44:42.220]  were also US spies crawling all over the place it was near embassies and
[03:44:42.220 --> 03:44:46.180]  military American stuff but I don't know there aren't there are some military
[03:44:46.180 --> 03:44:52.060]  US military enclaves but mainly just offices okay and the third question is
[03:44:52.060 --> 03:44:58.180]  the guest you had last week for like three different days very important I
[03:44:58.180 --> 03:45:02.260]  can't remember his name it's not important under Steve Pachennick yeah he
[03:45:02.260 --> 03:45:09.500]  if we could get that those three interviews of on CD or even DVD or
[03:45:09.500 --> 03:45:13.380]  whatever so that I think it would speak where we could hand them out to people
[03:45:13.380 --> 03:45:19.020]  you know so so that we could address the the truth about this whole paper that's
[03:45:19.020 --> 03:45:24.020]  a great point the Pachennick interviews are all up on prison planet TV and
[03:45:24.020 --> 03:45:28.020]  they've got several million views and the aggregate at the Alex Jones channel
[03:45:28.020 --> 03:45:33.340]  on YouTube they're there free don't you have to pay for the to be to get on the
[03:45:33.340 --> 03:45:39.100]  Alex Jones channel to watch them no you don't know anybody on the internet can
[03:45:39.100 --> 03:45:43.460]  go yep I'd like to hand the CDs out I don't have internet yeah no I can't I
[03:45:43.460 --> 03:45:46.940]  can't give out free CDs because I have to pay to print the CDs and ship them and
[03:45:46.940 --> 03:45:52.140]  we'd be bankrupt in about a day but the prison planet TV members get it in
[03:45:52.140 --> 03:45:56.580]  higher quality it's uploaded there first there are expanded extras and things
[03:45:56.580 --> 03:46:00.220]  that are just on prison planet TV but that's pretty much a donation to be a
[03:46:00.220 --> 03:46:04.660]  prison planet TV member and it's all in one place and they suspended our YouTube
[03:46:04.660 --> 03:46:10.420]  channels before so it's there as an archive but 90% of what's on the prison
[03:46:10.420 --> 03:46:18.140]  planet TV is on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube okay I don't have internet
[03:46:18.140 --> 03:46:22.380]  but I'd like to hand out the CDs like chocolate and if I had paid $10 for an
[03:46:22.380 --> 03:46:28.860]  or whatever I would but anyway the other fourth question I heard Obama when
[03:46:28.860 --> 03:46:33.060]  he's you played the tape when he's announcing that we killed Obama Osama
[03:46:33.060 --> 03:46:40.020]  or whatever the town he said was a bad a bad yep but then I heard on the news
[03:46:40.020 --> 03:46:47.700]  that it was Islamabad so which is it about about ma'am they posed for a
[03:46:47.700 --> 03:46:54.020]  photo with Hillary covering her mouth going and said they were watching him
[03:46:54.020 --> 03:46:58.460]  killing and it turns out it was all fake no video feed nothing of course it's
[03:46:58.460 --> 03:47:01.500]  completely fake the whole thing's fake I appreciate your call really great
[03:47:01.500 --> 03:47:04.900]  points and questions and I went into fourth hour of overdrive to cover the
[03:47:04.900 --> 03:47:11.500]  10 facts it proved bin Laden fabled as a contrived hoax and ever got to it I'll
[03:47:11.500 --> 03:47:16.140]  try to hear in a moment Janice and I'm sorry you've been on hold so long what
[03:47:16.140 --> 03:47:19.860]  happens is I'm so fundamentally freaked out by this I can talk for five hours
[03:47:19.860 --> 03:47:23.940]  without taking calls or having a guest on then I want to warn people about how
[03:47:23.940 --> 03:47:28.380]  the statins are triggering the Alzheimer's so we have a medical doctor on
[03:47:28.380 --> 03:47:32.180]  about that I just want to warn people I just wanted to stop they're killing us
[03:47:32.180 --> 03:47:36.020]  but because they wear white lab coats we bow down and worship them because they
[03:47:36.020 --> 03:47:39.940]  wear police uniforms we bow down and worship them we have a corrupt sinister
[03:47:39.940 --> 03:47:43.940]  global elite of corrupt people that compete with each other to see who the
[03:47:43.940 --> 03:47:49.940]  most evil is to get into power and we are in a hellish situation let's go
[03:47:49.940 --> 03:47:56.420]  ahead and talk to Matt in Arizona Matt you're on the air good sir I sound
[03:47:56.420 --> 03:48:03.540]  pretty heated this morning but I just want to I talked to you last week
[03:48:03.540 --> 03:48:08.900]  Monday and you let's say about a year ago I started waking up a bit here and
[03:48:08.900 --> 03:48:13.820]  there you know I'm a military man have been for a long time and I've got a lot
[03:48:13.820 --> 03:48:19.340]  of information in my mind and I've been trying to figure out how to how to do my
[03:48:19.340 --> 03:48:23.140]  part you know like your little your statement on the radio you always say
[03:48:23.140 --> 03:48:27.860]  what are you doing to wake up start doing YouTube videos and you can even
[03:48:27.860 --> 03:48:33.020]  disguise your face if you want to exactly and I've I've legally researched
[03:48:33.020 --> 03:48:36.820]  what I'm allowed to say and what I'm not allowed to say of course I don't want to
[03:48:36.820 --> 03:48:42.820]  put anyone else or myself and Jeopardy because they will take care of you so I
[03:48:42.820 --> 03:48:47.340]  just want you know we have it at a certain point at a certain point we got
[03:48:47.340 --> 03:48:50.740]  to just say I don't care anymore you know you join the military to fight and
[03:48:50.740 --> 03:48:54.540]  die for America will America is being destroyed by the criminals that have
[03:48:54.540 --> 03:48:58.380]  taken control of it and our military and so yeah we don't even we can see we
[03:48:58.380 --> 03:49:01.300]  don't even need to know stuff it's classified we can see the movements
[03:49:01.300 --> 03:49:05.780]  they're making and we can then triangulate what's really going on behind
[03:49:05.780 --> 03:49:10.220]  the scenes but but specifically you see you have a lot of information that'll
[03:49:10.220 --> 03:49:14.980]  be informative what can you tell us go ahead well first of all in relation to
[03:49:14.980 --> 03:49:21.100]  Osama and how much we've known about him over the years and some I was
[03:49:21.100 --> 03:49:26.100]  involved in five continents have operated all over the world and a big
[03:49:26.100 --> 03:49:29.900]  part of my operation I was in the Navy and the Army and a big part of our
[03:49:29.900 --> 03:49:34.820]  operation in the Navy both in South China Sea the Middle East this has all
[03:49:34.820 --> 03:49:39.260]  been declassified the South China Sea the Middle East and off the coast of
[03:49:39.260 --> 03:49:46.220]  Somalia was to intercept board and essentially pick out people on these
[03:49:46.220 --> 03:49:50.780]  ships slave traders just you know they've been getting trying to leave
[03:49:50.780 --> 03:49:56.500]  Iraq get ahold of them question them and whoever we weren't interested in we
[03:49:56.500 --> 03:50:01.060]  just abandon them at sea or shoot them it's just normal they're terrorists you
[03:50:01.060 --> 03:50:04.380]  know they're allowed to be killed that's kind of the mentality of the military
[03:50:04.380 --> 03:50:09.380]  today you know no remorse just pop and it's over well for those that don't know
[03:50:09.380 --> 03:50:12.500]  they now admit in Afghanistan they just go in and wipe out whole villages that's
[03:50:12.500 --> 03:50:16.380]  what the good guys do and then there's this double think when the globalists
[03:50:16.380 --> 03:50:19.860]  kill us and say it's foreigners they're doing it we're like you know oh it's
[03:50:19.860 --> 03:50:23.420]  horrible our people have died then cry about it and freak out for you know
[03:50:23.420 --> 03:50:28.500]  months and cower under our beds while the TSA grumps one-year-old babies but
[03:50:28.500 --> 03:50:34.460]  please continue the information we gathered and we don't we're told that
[03:50:34.460 --> 03:50:39.620]  by the command the information we gathered was instrumental and we would
[03:50:39.620 --> 03:50:44.940]  constantly get more and more information we knew where he was every moment
[03:50:44.940 --> 03:50:49.220]  and one Tomahawk cruise missile that would have been over but we timed it to
[03:50:49.220 --> 03:50:52.660]  where it was politically correct now whether he was already dead whether we
[03:50:52.660 --> 03:50:58.420]  kill him a week ago only God knows that but you know it's very possibly was
[03:50:58.420 --> 03:51:03.900]  let me give folks something that's public in 1996 they had him in Sudan and
[03:51:03.900 --> 03:51:10.500]  they said come get him and then Clinton said no I mean it goes on and on right
[03:51:10.500 --> 03:51:14.740]  as far as the staff we are you know discussing last week that was it's
[03:51:14.740 --> 03:51:19.220]  part of what the military does you get your soldiers to you know when they
[03:51:19.220 --> 03:51:22.860]  enter the military you're thinking I'm here to serve my country I'm here to
[03:51:22.860 --> 03:51:29.260]  fight if I die so be it but they instill I hate you so now your goal in the
[03:51:29.260 --> 03:51:35.020]  military is to kill the enemy which isn't the point the point is to keep
[03:51:35.020 --> 03:51:39.380]  people free but at that point you stop caring about the people and people want
[03:51:39.380 --> 03:51:44.380]  to know whether soldiers will fire on American citizens well all they have to
[03:51:44.380 --> 03:51:48.820]  be told is those American citizens are a threat to your family and you start
[03:51:48.820 --> 03:51:53.620]  shooting them if you're willing to shoot innocent well are people in the
[03:51:53.620 --> 03:51:57.020]  military that you know because the people I know are waking up are people you
[03:51:57.020 --> 03:52:01.220]  know in the military are they aware of anything or the world government or the
[03:52:01.220 --> 03:52:05.700]  larger stuff that's going on or do they ask why is Amar al-Laki the new head of
[03:52:05.700 --> 03:52:09.500]  al-Qaeda hanging out secretly at the Pentagon I mean this is all admitted I
[03:52:09.500 --> 03:52:14.140] 'd say one in every five men or women that you question in the military about
[03:52:14.140 --> 03:52:21.780]  it they might they know but are they brave enough to speak out because it's
[03:52:21.780 --> 03:52:25.860]  not that they're gonna be taken in prison for speaking out it's too blatant
[03:52:25.860 --> 03:52:29.740]  it's too obvious but they're gonna be shunned they're not gonna get promotions
[03:52:29.740 --> 03:52:35.380]  they're not gonna get pay increases they're gonna lose their friends it's
[03:52:35.380 --> 03:52:40.100]  blatant it's you know it's like a closed community they'll shun you if you step
[03:52:40.100 --> 03:52:47.100]  outside yeah it's like the mafia exactly and as soon as you know we found out you
[03:52:47.100 --> 03:52:50.900]  know I found out the kind of atrocities that I saw in the military I mean
[03:52:50.900 --> 03:52:57.020]  absolute 100% atrocities I had to step back and say am I gonna be a part of
[03:52:57.020 --> 03:53:01.700]  this and I decided no I'm not gonna be a part of this you know regardless of what
[03:53:01.700 --> 03:53:06.420]  they decided to do to me I'm not gonna stand in front of God later on and say
[03:53:06.420 --> 03:53:12.540]  oh I didn't choose a side as it went along you know with what was normal
[03:53:12.540 --> 03:53:17.940]  because guess what that doesn't work so I so when you guys would pull the ships
[03:53:17.940 --> 03:53:21.380]  over what percentage of the people that you line up on the deck and shoot in the
[03:53:21.380 --> 03:53:26.100]  head well mostly went on in the other ship it wasn't done
[03:53:26.100 --> 03:53:31.860]  play me out publicly I'd say we grabbed maybe 10% of the people on the ship
[03:53:31.860 --> 03:53:37.740]  because the majority of them are slaves or just trucked out human trafficking but
[03:53:37.740 --> 03:53:43.300]  most of them we just stranded at sea we disable the ship board the ship and then
[03:53:43.300 --> 03:53:47.500]  just stranded at sea that way we're not saying we murdered them their ship
[03:53:47.500 --> 03:53:52.620]  broke down and in the rest we would either shoot right there the ones who
[03:53:52.620 --> 03:53:57.540]  were armed and the rest you fly off and God knows I have no idea what happened
[03:53:57.540 --> 03:54:01.860]  those guys from there yeah they've got hundreds of black sites where every pervert
[03:54:01.860 --> 03:54:05.420]  psychiatrist a government operative that loves to I mean I read those army
[03:54:05.420 --> 03:54:09.860]  reports the Takumi report what they did Abu Ghraib to the kids and it's all
[03:54:09.860 --> 03:54:14.740]  just admitted and that's what the good guys do they take acid and pour it in
[03:54:14.740 --> 03:54:19.460]  a little kid and and I don't know it's pretty demonic but that's that's that's
[03:54:19.460 --> 03:54:23.580]  why we're judged it's why America's going down right these thoughts have been
[03:54:23.580 --> 03:54:28.700]  surfacing over time you know about a year goes doing a paper on concentration
[03:54:28.700 --> 03:54:34.620]  camps in Nazi Germany and Nazi Germany overall and I found an article about
[03:54:34.620 --> 03:54:39.660]  you know United States concentration camps and it was one of those moments of
[03:54:39.660 --> 03:54:44.620]  thinking okay this really be going on which caused me to research more and
[03:54:44.620 --> 03:54:50.860]  more and I watched some of your videos and I saw things online and everyone I
[03:54:50.860 --> 03:54:55.980]  discussed this with especially in the military I mean pure 100% denial
[03:54:55.980 --> 03:55:00.700]  regardless of how many facts you showed them it's just an example right now how
[03:55:00.700 --> 03:55:06.460]  brainwashed this country is it really is it's no longer a theory no longer a
[03:55:06.460 --> 03:55:11.220]  conspiracy theory all these things that were called conspiracy theories 10 years
[03:55:11.220 --> 03:55:17.340]  ago the mainstream media admits their fact oh I see articles in last month a
[03:55:17.340 --> 03:55:21.100]  bunch of them where they go yeah we had to get tough with them in Afghanistan we
[03:55:21.100 --> 03:55:25.220]  just go in and kick doors in and kill everybody and then I hear people on
[03:55:25.220 --> 03:55:28.980]  local radio going yeah they're getting tough that's how you win wars Rush
[03:55:28.980 --> 03:55:33.100]  Limbaugh is like wow we accidentally killed people in World War two we bombed
[03:55:33.100 --> 03:55:37.380]  whole cities we didn't do that until World War two the point is it's like a
[03:55:37.380 --> 03:55:41.780]  tough guy thing well most those guys are coming back to be cops and they're
[03:55:41.780 --> 03:55:46.500]  damaged goods I mean either they freak out and and and you know repent for it
[03:55:46.500 --> 03:55:51.260]  but are still screwed up or they want more and more and I remember Private
[03:55:51.260 --> 03:55:57.300]  Gruckheimer 2002 Ithaca Journal Ithaca New York he said I'm proud of what we did
[03:55:57.300 --> 03:56:00.660]  we went into whole villages killed everybody including babies and the
[03:56:00.660 --> 03:56:05.100]  Pentagon came out on Fox News two days later and said we want to clarify we
[03:56:05.100 --> 03:56:12.420]  only kill everyone in certain villages I mean why kill little children did you
[03:56:12.420 --> 03:56:18.540]  ever hear about that killing little kids I know it happened I know it happens I
[03:56:18.540 --> 03:56:23.140]  never saw it personally but I did see things that were almost equally
[03:56:23.140 --> 03:56:26.660]  it's horrible so I guess you just walk over to the baby crab there's a little
[03:56:26.660 --> 03:56:30.020]  one-year-old you just what you just take a riot shot down up to the head and
[03:56:30.020 --> 03:56:36.420]  boom it's just a go team America yeah that baby's head blew off just like
[03:56:36.420 --> 03:56:43.180]  Pat Tillman's yeah I took him out that sort of thing isn't as common I mean
[03:56:43.180 --> 03:56:47.420]  most of us aren't that heartless but it mostly happens with a Tomahawk cruise
[03:56:47.420 --> 03:56:53.340]  missile or angry that was poorly placed it's one of those things where some
[03:56:53.340 --> 03:56:58.900]  some soldiers not many will strike their shoulders and walk away others you know
[03:56:58.900 --> 03:57:03.740]  like myself that things I've seen and some of the things I've done all it'll
[03:57:03.740 --> 03:57:08.020]  haunt me and stay with me for the rest of my life and that's my punishment for
[03:57:08.020 --> 03:57:11.660]  going along with it and being part of it well let me tell you brother it's not
[03:57:11.660 --> 03:57:16.420]  just gonna haunt you Matt it's now coming back to America everything we
[03:57:16.420 --> 03:57:22.420]  visited on others will come back on a seven-fold exactly and I've explained
[03:57:22.420 --> 03:57:27.740]  you know pull my wife but some of these things that haunt me and it's almost like
[03:57:27.740 --> 03:57:32.380]  she thinks it's normal you know oh this is just what happens to people in the
[03:57:32.380 --> 03:57:36.340]  military and she's right now you know the things that happen in Vietnam
[03:57:36.340 --> 03:57:42.340]  everybody look back on that you know over past that what wrong that's how we
[03:57:42.340 --> 03:57:46.900]  get well you know in apocalypse now there the no it's full metal jacket
[03:57:46.900 --> 03:57:52.300]  they're flying around and the guy says how do you kill women and children he's
[03:57:52.300 --> 03:57:55.700]  shooting them out of a helicopter you know in an area not controlled by the
[03:57:55.700 --> 03:58:00.100]  VC and he says how do you kill women and children a joker doesn't he says it's
[03:58:00.100 --> 03:58:03.620]  easy you just don't lead them so much because women and children don't run as
[03:58:03.620 --> 03:58:08.860]  fast and this starts laughing I was talking to Dr. Bob Bowman he I think he
[03:58:08.860 --> 03:58:13.300]  on air I think he told the story he knew fighter pilots who would just shoot up
[03:58:13.300 --> 03:58:18.220]  innocent people for fun and it becomes like a video game I talked to other
[03:58:18.220 --> 03:58:23.220]  Vietnam vets where it was like that it's just kill them tell them all let God
[03:58:23.220 --> 03:58:26.980]  sort them out I think that was a Jesuit saying from before I'm going into

[03:59:48.620 --> 04:00:00.660]  since 1976 you're listening to GCN great talk radio starts here
[04:00:02.980 --> 04:00:10.300]  you know what happens is I get all wound up studying all this and I get on
[04:00:10.300 --> 04:00:16.220]  air and I have this vision this idea of how I'm gonna present it all how to
[04:00:16.220 --> 04:00:19.700]  reach out to people so they can know what I know and know how real it all is I
[04:00:19.700 --> 04:00:29.740]  don't mean to sound nasty about things but you've got to be honest about what
[04:00:29.740 --> 04:00:40.260]  we've become the wages of sin are death I look at how the brain degeneration type
[04:00:40.260 --> 04:00:49.660]  diseases are just epidemic I look at infertility being epidemic I look at
[04:00:49.660 --> 04:00:56.460]  diabetes being epidemic I look at IQs plunging I heard Dr. Blalock earlier
[04:00:56.460 --> 04:00:59.580]  talking about how they have these studies they use to push statins and
[04:00:59.580 --> 04:01:03.300]  things and they'll they'll they'll spin the study in an article but then you
[04:01:03.300 --> 04:01:08.660]  read this study it says the opposite that reminded me of in the 1970s they
[04:01:08.660 --> 04:01:13.540]  tried to get FDA approval three separate times it succeeded the third time
[04:01:13.540 --> 04:01:21.540]  in 1981 when Rumsfeld took it over at Searle a division of Monsanto and the
[04:01:21.540 --> 04:01:25.260]  military been developing chemical weapons in the 60s and discovered a
[04:01:25.260 --> 04:01:29.860]  genetically engineered E. Coli that would eat eat a form of toxic waste and
[04:01:29.860 --> 04:01:36.260]  then defecate aspartame they tested on monkeys and the studies they finally
[04:01:36.260 --> 04:01:42.100]  used to get approved it was the boil down that Rumsfeld had written of studies
[04:01:42.100 --> 04:01:47.380]  what in 76 where out of the baby Reese's monkeys that were fed aspartame in
[04:01:47.380 --> 04:01:52.660]  their milk their mother's milk large percentage died of brain tumors very
[04:01:52.660 --> 04:01:57.180]  quickly the others were retarded and all the others had major health problems
[04:01:57.180 --> 04:02:03.820]  and they use that study to get it approved and I'm reminded of the New
[04:02:03.820 --> 04:02:09.140]  World Order everywhere I go but they use a study that says this stuff will kill
[04:02:09.140 --> 04:02:19.060]  you to get it approved I mean you got to love it yeah well it gives me a headache
[04:02:19.060 --> 04:02:26.380]  makes me want to cry it really does and our family members will die our family
[04:02:26.380 --> 04:02:30.060]  members are will get these degenerative diseases and we'll sit there and watch
[04:02:30.060 --> 04:02:36.420]  it God forbid our children and the sicko globalist front puppets like Obama out
[04:02:36.420 --> 04:02:40.380]  there for everybody to see all the scientific dictatorship operates in the
[04:02:40.380 --> 04:02:44.620]  shadows right behind them and people choose sides I'm a Republican I'm a
[04:02:44.620 --> 04:02:48.820]  Democrat I'm a Bush supporter I'm an Obama supporter I'm a Mitt Romney
[04:02:48.820 --> 04:02:55.740]  supporter I'm an Obama supporter it's just it's all folly and our species if
[04:02:55.740 --> 04:03:00.300]  it didn't have such a criminal elite and if we weren't so weak and allow them
[04:03:00.300 --> 04:03:04.780]  to do this the potential is incredible people took out a context my
[04:03:04.780 --> 04:03:09.300]  terrorism's big dirty secret video some of them did what I call kind of modern
[04:03:09.300 --> 04:03:12.860]  day Bible Pharisees they don't care about what's really in the Bible they just
[04:03:12.860 --> 04:03:16.700]  like to thump it and feel official I said if we can get ourselves together
[04:03:16.700 --> 04:03:21.820]  thousands of years from now our progeny will you know be the equivalent of
[04:03:21.820 --> 04:03:25.820]  gods compared to what we are today I didn't say gods I mean people flying
[04:03:25.820 --> 04:03:30.260]  around in jet airplanes computers all this technology folks 3000 years ago
[04:03:30.260 --> 04:03:37.540]  would think you were a God that's my point I know my life is so short I want
[04:03:37.540 --> 04:03:42.820]  good things for people I care about other people's children I I like happy
[04:03:42.820 --> 04:03:48.060]  people I like happy folks you know in a pub banging their beer steins together
[04:03:48.060 --> 04:03:53.940]  and singing I I like good things I got a lot of love I got a lot of happiness I
[04:03:53.940 --> 04:04:01.020]  I'm a sweet person and I'm just sick of devilish little goblin globalist running
[04:04:01.020 --> 04:04:05.860]  everything because we're too lazy to stop them now I got a lot of stuff I need
[04:04:05.860 --> 04:04:09.740]  to do and I said I'd get to ten facts that prove bin Laden fables a contrived
[04:04:09.740 --> 04:04:13.220]  hoax what I'm gonna do is when I end this show here in a few minutes I'm gonna
[04:04:13.220 --> 04:04:17.100]  go shoot a YouTube video kind of a prototype of the TV show we're developing
[04:04:17.100 --> 04:04:21.500]  we've got a round table one we do we've also got it with the graphics and the
[04:04:21.500 --> 04:04:26.460]  green screen we're debugging all of that right now but if I wasn't busy doing
[04:04:26.460 --> 04:04:29.620]  this all the time I'd already haven't launched I gotta have a meeting on the
[04:04:29.620 --> 04:04:36.060]  social network we're almost done with finally but ten facts that prove bin
[04:04:36.060 --> 04:04:40.140]  Laden fables a contrived hoax I'm gonna do a video on that and cover it more
[04:04:40.140 --> 04:04:44.060]  tomorrow we do have Jesse Ventura coming on get that first view on what he
[04:04:44.060 --> 04:04:47.420]  thinks about the bin Laden situation tomorrow joining us from Mexico that'll
[04:04:47.420 --> 04:04:51.260]  be a first for this transmission Everton Florida you're on the air go ahead
[04:04:51.260 --> 04:04:57.620]  then Ron and Estevan and that's it ever go ahead thanks Alex this isn't the
[04:04:57.620 --> 04:05:02.380]  reason why I called but I did go verify the aspartame and all the gum after I
[04:05:02.380 --> 04:05:09.660]  originally heard you say that so and that sugar gum that sugar gum it's in
[04:05:09.660 --> 04:05:14.780]  almost every brand it is very hard to find it and it's now going in candies
[04:05:14.780 --> 04:05:22.060]  bread they're hitting as hard with it yep so my question is how do we square up
[04:05:22.060 --> 04:05:27.380]  the Benazar Budo video which she probably gave her life for to outside
[04:05:27.380 --> 04:05:35.100]  cheek the man she said who killed of Osama with the renal failure from Dr.
[04:05:35.100 --> 04:05:40.980]  P's neck how you know what what are we to what are we left to think well most of
[04:05:40.980 --> 04:05:47.940]  the intelligence professionals say he died 2001 I don't know the fact is that
[04:05:47.940 --> 04:05:53.500]  Budo killing the myth and and she'd been a corrupt globalist but then she went
[04:05:53.500 --> 04:05:56.620]  against him and then they machined under and said she hit her head remember
[04:05:56.620 --> 04:06:02.500]  that lie only our media around with the hoax oh Budo hit her head give me a
[04:06:02.500 --> 04:06:06.780]  break but I don't know how we square that I mean they're conflicting reports
[04:06:06.780 --> 04:06:11.100]  the point is it was on record that he was treated by the end and met with the
[04:06:11.100 --> 04:06:20.100]  CIA in 2001 even CBS News reported that okay and the other thing is the tilted
[04:06:20.100 --> 04:06:25.580]  coffin photo if I'm not mistaken a while back you had mentioned they had
[04:06:25.580 --> 04:06:31.540]  captured some high sticks guy and they killed him and buried him at the seat
[04:06:31.540 --> 04:06:36.260]  also and I remember seeing a photo in one of the magazines of another tilted
[04:06:36.260 --> 04:06:42.060]  coffin if I'm not mistaken it was the same photo well I think that photo that
[04:06:42.060 --> 04:06:45.140]  the media has been running with and we've posted is just an image of burial at
[04:06:45.140 --> 04:06:49.420]  sea I don't believe they were that they've released the deal but the been
[04:06:49.420 --> 04:06:56.740]  wadden burial at sea okay I'll have to look into that anything else ever that's
[04:06:56.740 --> 04:07:01.260]  it just good rant and rave again today well thank you for putting up with me
[04:07:01.260 --> 04:07:03.260]  I

[04:07:12.100 --> 04:07:16.620]  should be positive people are waking up a big portion of folks I don't know if
[04:07:16.620 --> 04:07:20.020]  it's a majority but it from what I've heard on talk radio it is are not buying
[04:07:20.020 --> 04:07:24.820]  this the burial at sea that the could the changing stories the fake photo of
[04:07:24.820 --> 04:07:29.620]  them watching the murder of been lot and the the extrajudicial killing I mean it

[04:08:39.460 --> 04:08:48.220]  it is Ron good to hear from you that's why the globalists know they've been
[04:08:48.220 --> 04:08:52.180]  caught in her liar so they go with the big lie number Hitler said the bigger
[04:08:52.180 --> 04:08:57.180]  the lie the more people believe it and he was actually talking about the soviets
[04:08:57.180 --> 04:09:02.900]  putting out big lies and and how they're so big they're so outrageous but he
[04:09:02.900 --> 04:09:07.940]  understood that as well and used it that people can't believe an outrageous lie
[04:09:07.940 --> 04:09:12.740]  could be a lie because it's so bold the bigger the lie the more they'll believe
[04:09:12.740 --> 04:09:18.580]  it let's talk to Esteban in Oklahoma thanks for holding her on the ear hey
[04:09:18.580 --> 04:09:24.260]  Alex how's it going okay sir I know you're kind of down today with all the
[04:09:24.260 --> 04:09:29.740]  with all the bad news but I think I have a little one more than people that people
[04:09:29.740 --> 04:09:34.740]  should know I'm an investigator researcher and all doing some
[04:09:34.740 --> 04:09:39.380]  investigation for a book that I'm working on I ran into some information that I
[04:09:39.380 --> 04:09:43.940]  thought people should know this is not related to anything you've been talking
[04:09:43.940 --> 04:09:51.300]  about but the thing is that Isaac Newton he was an alchemist I don't know if
[04:09:51.300 --> 04:09:55.580]  people know this or not he practiced alchemy and he was working on the
[04:09:55.580 --> 04:09:59.140]  philosopher's stone which I'm sure people have heard of and Harry Potter and
[04:09:59.140 --> 04:10:04.660]  other places it's supposed to be a mythological thing for those of you who
[04:10:04.660 --> 04:10:11.900]  don't know it what it does it transmitates an element and to go mainly
[04:10:11.900 --> 04:10:24.260]  lit and there is an in history and anybody can go look this up the guy by
[04:10:24.260 --> 04:10:30.660]  the name of Raymond Lola he is documented in history or making 50,000
[04:10:30.660 --> 04:10:36.180]  pounds of worth of gold for King Edward II during the 1200s now the thing with
[04:10:36.180 --> 04:10:42.500]  Isaac Newton is that he that our government is funding our government
[04:10:42.500 --> 04:10:47.460]  on the UK government are funding two projects and anybody can find this on
[04:10:47.460 --> 04:10:53.060]  the Wikipedia really easy don't believe it but one has been it's called the
[04:10:53.060 --> 04:10:57.700]  chemistry of Isaac Newton project and it's been supported by the US going in
[04:10:57.700 --> 04:11:01.220]  the National Science Foundation and the other one is the Newton project
[04:11:01.220 --> 04:11:06.220]  supported by the UK arts and humanities research board the the thing is that they
[04:11:06.220 --> 04:11:12.380]  are working on turning basically letting to go if that happens if they're
[04:11:12.380 --> 04:11:17.380]  successful which I believe they will according to history gold will be worth
[04:11:17.380 --> 04:11:21.580]  nothing so all these people are investing in gold for the rainy days are
[04:11:21.580 --> 04:11:26.860]  coming well there you have it they got an alchemist that can make magic gold I
[04:11:26.860 --> 04:11:31.860]  appreciate your call there's actually a device I forget the exact name of it and
[04:11:31.860 --> 04:11:35.940]  it uses the amount of power they taught us about it in high school then in
[04:11:35.940 --> 04:11:40.540]  college that you know that a major city uses in a day and they've made new
[04:11:40.540 --> 04:11:45.500]  elements with it they have been able to change things into other elements with
[04:11:45.500 --> 04:11:51.980]  it but most scientists hundreds of years ago 500 years ago or before it was
[04:11:51.980 --> 04:11:55.540]  mixed in with religion alchemy and science because they were trying to
[04:11:55.540 --> 04:12:01.860]  figure things out there was a lot of mumbo jumbo tied into it but there you
[04:12:01.860 --> 04:12:06.020]  go ladies and gentlemen there they've got they're going to come out with a
[04:12:06.020 --> 04:12:10.620]  machine that makes gold so gold isn't needed anymore I doubt the globalists
[04:12:10.620 --> 04:12:12.900]  will even let something like that come to market because they're some of the
[04:12:12.900 --> 04:12:16.700]  biggest owners in gold and I'll close with this I'll talk more about it tomorrow
[04:12:16.700 --> 04:12:20.980]  you see gold now I believe they said today it was going back up if you look
[04:12:20.980 --> 04:12:24.580]  at an 11-year chart we'll talk about it tomorrow it always dips down before it
[04:12:24.580 --> 04:12:28.460]  goes back up and then dips down before it goes back up and then with the silver
[04:12:28.460 --> 04:12:34.660]  and gold going down the last few weeks that's the system as we predicted using
[04:12:34.660 --> 04:12:39.540]  the paper market to try to beat it down but because physical demand is so high
[04:12:39.540 --> 04:12:44.700]  and because overall commodity prices are so high because of dollar devaluation
[04:12:44.700 --> 04:12:51.140]  it is basically driving it upwards so they can always hammer it down for a
[04:12:51.140 --> 04:12:55.700]  period but the last 11 years it only picks back up that's how it's different
[04:12:55.700 --> 04:12:59.660]  than the Hunt brothers in 1980 that was just them simply trying to corner the
[04:12:59.660 --> 04:13:04.260]  silver market by buying up so much of it this is a different scenario and that's
[04:13:04.260 --> 04:13:08.420]  why I haven't sold any of the gold I mean when gold went from 260 to 500 and
[04:13:08.420 --> 04:13:12.340]  then dropped to 400 didn't sell it when it went from 500 to 800 and dropped back
[04:13:12.340 --> 04:13:16.700]  to 600 didn't sell it when it went from 800 to a thousand and then back down to
[04:13:16.700 --> 04:13:20.980]  800 didn't sell it when it went to a 1200 and then back down to a thousand didn't
[04:13:20.980 --> 04:13:25.340]  sell it when it went to 1400 and then back to 1200 didn't sell it when it went
[04:13:25.340 --> 04:13:29.260]  to 1500 and then dip back down earlier in the year didn't sell it and I'm not
[04:13:29.260 --> 04:13:34.100]  selling it now I mean it could go down by half I wouldn't sell it because
[04:13:34.100 --> 04:13:39.100]  fundamentally global paper currencies are being devalued great job of the crew
[04:13:39.100 --> 04:13:44.580]  I'm out of here I will go over more of the ridiculous lies of bin Laden
[04:13:44.580 --> 04:13:49.620]  killing tomorrow we got some big guests like Jesse Ventura tomorrow as well
[04:13:49.620 --> 04:13:54.180]  some other big guests throughout the week and I'll be here all week long going
[04:13:54.180 --> 04:13:58.460]  into overdrive if we need to and info waters and prison planet have never
[04:13:58.460 --> 04:14:02.100]  reached more people and it's quite frankly shocking and a great
[04:14:02.100 --> 04:14:06.300]  responsibility and if I get a little nasty and angry sometimes we need to be
[04:14:06.300 --> 04:14:10.800]  that way to shake people out of their comfort zone and the trance they're
[04:14:10.800 --> 04:14:15.540]  under America and the rest of the world it's time to awaken to the scientific
[04:14:15.540 --> 04:14:19.340]  dictatorship and to turn the tide against tyranny it's starting to happen
[04:14:19.340 --> 04:14:48.620]  that's why their frauds are getting more and more outrageous God bless you all
