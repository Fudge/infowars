[00:00.000 --> 00:27.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:27.000 --> 00:34.000]  The Trilateral Commission has been in arm of the globalist deep state since 1973.
[00:34.000 --> 00:42.000]  Last week at their annual meeting, a speaker who cannot be identified according to commission rules said that
[00:42.000 --> 00:48.000]  we are now in a period of structural inflation that will last for decades.
[00:48.000 --> 00:53.000]  They said that the free market is over and industry now sets policy.
[00:53.000 --> 01:01.000]  And they said that this year, 2023 is year one of this new global order.
[01:01.000 --> 01:09.000]  Days later, the Federal Reserve Bank announces a July launch for their new FedNow service,
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  which was first announced in October of 2021.
[01:13.000 --> 01:18.000]  The two big to fail banks and all the large processors are already on board.
[01:18.000 --> 01:21.000]  And so is the US Treasury.
[01:21.000 --> 01:31.000]  The first week of April, the Federal Reserve begins the FedNow pilot program for early adopters to become certified participants
[01:31.000 --> 01:35.000]  to help the Fed confirm readiness for their July launch.
[01:35.000 --> 01:42.000]  FedNow is an instant payment processing system that seeks to be the base of all digital transactions,
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  acting as an umbrella company to manage all financial payments.
[01:47.000 --> 01:53.000]  This has been shown to be the gateway to a central bank digital currency, CBDC.
[01:53.000 --> 02:03.000]  FedNow is much like the Reserve Bank of India's instant payment system, the Unified Payments Interface, or UPI.
[02:03.000 --> 02:10.000]  UPI has had huge success in converting rural communities into a complete cashless society.
[02:10.000 --> 02:20.000]  According to the International Monetary Fund, UPI democratized the payment system and paved the way for central bank digital currencies.
[02:20.000 --> 02:29.000]  Central bank instant payment processing is also how the central bank of Nigeria introduced its CBDC, INIRA,
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  which has been so far violently rejected.
[02:33.000 --> 02:36.000]  Reporting for Infowars, this is Greg Rees.
[02:36.000 --> 02:43.000]  And they're bringing it home to America, coming to Chinese style.
[03:06.000 --> 03:09.000]  It's time thinking about World War II.
[03:09.000 --> 03:13.000]  Target selection complete. Time on target sequence complete.
[03:13.000 --> 03:21.000]  Twenty-two Type 1 class submarines departing Petropavlovsk, turning southbound at Nordkaff, bearing 095 degrees.
[03:21.000 --> 03:25.000]  Radar reports two unknown tracks are penetrating the Alaska near defense zone.
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  From the front lines of the information war.
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.000]  Flush the bombers, get the subs in launch mode. We are at DEF CON 1.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  Are you prepared to destroy the enemy?
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.000]  You bet!
[03:39.000 --> 03:43.000]  Defending the Republic from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  We'll keep control, but we'll keep it here at the top where it belongs.
[03:46.000 --> 03:53.000]  Three, two, one, impact. Shall we play a game?
[03:53.000 --> 03:59.000]  How about global thermal nuclear war?
[03:59.000 --> 04:04.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[04:04.000 --> 04:08.000]  All units confirm weapons targeted and ready, awaiting launch codes.
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  We are in launch mode.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  Do you really believe that the enemy would attack without provocation?
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[04:18.000 --> 04:19.000]  We're in.
[04:19.000 --> 04:21.000]  Russians are still denying everything, sir.
[04:21.000 --> 04:24.000]  We have Soviet submarine launch detection.
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  I wish I didn't know about any of this. I wish I was like everybody else.
[04:28.000 --> 04:35.000]  The end. The only winning goal is not to play.
[04:40.000 --> 04:46.000]  It's Monday. That's Monday, March 20th, 2023.
[04:46.000 --> 04:51.000]  Big broadcast lined up for you today. Robert Barnes on in the second hour.
[04:51.000 --> 04:54.000]  We're going to open the phones up.
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  We are on Trump indictment arrest watch. Stay with us.
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[05:29.000 --> 05:33.000]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[05:40.000 --> 05:43.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[05:43.000 --> 05:46.000]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[05:46.000 --> 05:49.000]  The government, years, Alex Jones.
[05:49.000 --> 05:54.000]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[06:19.000 --> 06:23.000]  Here we are Monday, March 20th, 2023.
[06:23.000 --> 06:25.000]  We're host Alex Jones. We'll be here for the next four hours.
[06:25.000 --> 06:28.000]  And then the great Owen Shroyer takes over 3 p.m. Central.
[06:28.000 --> 06:31.000]  Then FullWars.com and stations across the country.
[06:31.000 --> 06:37.000]  All right. Obviously we're on Trump indictment arrest watch with the kangaroo puppet.
[06:37.000 --> 06:41.000]  George Soros's DA.
[06:41.000 --> 06:50.000]  They're carrying out the operations in New York City.
[06:50.000 --> 06:55.000]  We have all of the accoutrements that goes with that.
[06:55.000 --> 07:02.000]  We have Gigi Ping arriving in Moscow to meet with Putin.
[07:02.000 --> 07:07.000]  And the arrest warrant obviously issued for Putin last Friday.
[07:07.000 --> 07:12.000]  Notice all this is happening at the same moment.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  Are you in arrest warrants for Putin?
[07:15.000 --> 07:19.000]  Arrest being prepared for Trump?
[07:19.000 --> 07:23.000]  Basically it's anybody that opposes the globalists that run this country.
[07:23.000 --> 07:27.000]  I'm certainly not saying Gigi Ping's a good guy or Putin's perfect,
[07:27.000 --> 07:30.000]  just because they're not part of this new rule order.
[07:30.000 --> 07:33.000]  Gigi Ping has his new rule order.
[07:33.000 --> 07:36.000]  Russia just wants to be left alone, but the United States is occupied
[07:36.000 --> 07:41.000]  and hijacked by some very, very serious criminals.
[07:41.000 --> 07:46.000]  So we're going to be laying it all out here today.
[07:46.000 --> 07:52.000]  Also, we're going to be looking at what's happening with the economy.
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  We have different international bank monitoring groups and rating services
[07:57.000 --> 08:04.000]  like Moody's and others saying that over 200 banks are on the verge of insolvency.
[08:04.000 --> 08:09.000]  It's real bad, Western country central bank, some of the weekend organized
[08:09.000 --> 08:17.000]  to provide daily liquidity of dollars in the event of a worldwide bank collapse.
[08:17.000 --> 08:24.000]  We'll also be looking at more studies coming out that lockdowns massively increase illness and death,
[08:24.000 --> 08:31.000]  not just from the virus, but from suicide more and how they knew exactly what they were doing.
[08:31.000 --> 08:36.000]  Also have a big stack of articles of so-called intellectuals, thought leaders,
[08:36.000 --> 08:42.000]  philosophers of the left praising censorship and saying,
[08:42.000 --> 08:46.000]  those we don't agree with don't deserve to be heard.
[08:46.000 --> 08:51.000]  You should not have opinions on Ukraine vaccines or climate change.
[08:51.000 --> 08:58.000]  That's leftist thinker they call him, Sam Harris, the condescension, the arrogance.
[08:58.000 --> 09:05.000]  The self-appointed control freaks is flabbergasting and that ties in with Yahoo News promoting,
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  it's reasonable we should rewrite Shakespeare or well and everything else.
[09:09.000 --> 09:17.000]  It's not censorship, it's evolution.
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  Yes, it's not rewriting literary history.
[09:20.000 --> 09:21.000]  It's not super scary.
[09:21.000 --> 09:24.000]  It's not a tent on the record scale of tyranny.
[09:24.000 --> 09:34.000]  No, I mean Ed Harris is a philosopher who comes off like someone with an ADIQ,
[09:34.000 --> 09:37.000]  but we've got Sam Harris.
[09:37.000 --> 09:40.000]  We've got to bow down to him.
[09:40.000 --> 09:43.000]  We've got to worship him.
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  We're going to be going over all of that as well.
[09:47.000 --> 09:58.000]  Also, I've seen three reports the last couple days of young people dying in Mexico unexplainedly
[09:58.000 --> 10:04.000]  and then later it's linked to fentanyl and our media says don't go to Mexico.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  It's so dangerous.
[10:06.000 --> 10:13.000]  Well in the last week, three people I know, two of them very well or three groups I know,
[10:13.000 --> 10:19.000]  because in one group I'm good friends with the husband and the wife have known him for 27 years.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  I'm not going to say their names, they asked me not to this morning.
[10:23.000 --> 10:31.000]  But three groups of people in the last week who lost family members to fentanyl and at least in one case,
[10:31.000 --> 10:39.000]  their niece was a medical student who didn't do drugs and went to a party and fell down dead
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  and they tested her blood.
[10:40.000 --> 10:47.000]  It was fentanyl, somebody obviously slipped it in her drink thinking it would make her, I guess, more pliable
[10:47.000 --> 10:56.000]  and she's dead and I actually knew her at her a couple times when she was a little girl.
[10:56.000 --> 11:04.000]  She was 24 years old and is dead.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  And so my point is, oh, three people died in Mexico in the last couple days of fentanyl.
[11:10.000 --> 11:12.000]  Okay.
[11:12.000 --> 11:25.000]  Well, I know three people who've died just in my circle of friends who had family die from fentanyl in the last week.
[11:25.000 --> 11:27.000]  I mean, it is scary.
[11:27.000 --> 11:31.000]  They say it's killing 100,000 people a year, ladies and gentlemen.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  It's killing way more than that.
[11:33.000 --> 11:43.000]  I know so many people who have lost family members, including sons and daughters to this.
[11:43.000 --> 11:50.000]  And now there's cases of 50, 60 year olds in places like Dominican Republic,
[11:50.000 --> 11:52.000]  which has been a nice place to go previously.
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  I've never been there, but I hear it's nice and expensive.
[11:56.000 --> 12:05.000]  But they get in the minibar and somebody sticks fentanyl in the whiskey and they die.
[12:05.000 --> 12:09.000]  So this isn't something like you're a drug addict or you're a druggy.
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  You go to a party, you take a hit off somebody's vape.
[12:12.000 --> 12:14.000]  They tell you it's THC or marijuana.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  You're dead or a baby's crawling around.
[12:17.000 --> 12:21.000]  You hear about this whole time on the ground at the park or outside and get some fentanyl on their finger
[12:21.000 --> 12:24.000]  and sticks it in their mouth and dies or almost dies.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  I mean, we see them every day.
[12:26.000 --> 12:31.000]  It's just to me, what are we going to do about this?
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  I mean, it is just so crazy and I have four children.
[12:37.000 --> 12:51.000]  And I'm very blessed that the adult children don't even drink or smoke marijuana.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  And then the 15-year-old does it.
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  It's not into that. That's good.
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.000]  And then, of course, my five-and-a-half-year-old has not ever had a chance to experience that.
[13:01.000 --> 13:02.000]  And that's good.
[13:02.000 --> 13:11.000]  But it just enrages me that you could have a child or they could be 15, they could be 30, they could be 25.
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  And they go to a party.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  And now it's happened to older folks and somebody hands you a marijuana cigarette
[13:19.000 --> 13:25.000]  and you take a puff off of it and you're dead five minutes later.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  I mean, this is just crazy.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  Absolutely crazy.
[13:33.000 --> 13:41.000]  I have another friend who's in his early 70s and he was just having four or five months ago.
[13:41.000 --> 13:46.000]  His pacemaker updated.
[13:46.000 --> 13:50.000]  They said to go in and pick something and it's a minor surgery.
[13:50.000 --> 13:51.000]  It's seen as a minor heart surgery.
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  No heart surgery is minor, in my view, but it's seen as one of the safest procedures.
[13:55.000 --> 14:00.000]  And it almost killed him.
[14:00.000 --> 14:08.000]  And he went into a coma for a couple of days because they decided to use the anesthesiologist,
[14:08.000 --> 14:19.000]  fentanyl, as the anesthesia, and it almost killed him.
[14:19.000 --> 14:26.000]  So this fentanyl, and you can look it up, the U.S. government created it, of course,
[14:26.000 --> 14:30.000]  back in the 70s.
[14:30.000 --> 14:39.000]  And now the Communist Chinese and MS-13 arrested criminal groups and figured out how to make it.
[14:39.000 --> 14:43.000]  And this is just the beginning of all these super synthetic drugs and stuff.
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  I got to tell you this.
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.000]  I don't trust this criminal government to carry out the death penalty.
[14:49.000 --> 14:51.000]  I know they love to target innocent people.
[14:51.000 --> 14:57.000]  But at the same time, I really think they should expedite the execution of people selling fentanyl.
[14:57.000 --> 15:03.000]  You know, they don't have any fentanyl deaths in Communist China because if they catch you with opiates,
[15:03.000 --> 15:06.000]  they execute your ass.
[15:06.000 --> 15:14.000]  And there's very few executions a year in China of drug dealers because people know you do it, you're dead.
[15:14.000 --> 15:20.000]  But this has gotten so out of control, now we have hundreds of thousands of people dying a year.
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.000]  And I want to ask the question, the numbers are going straight up, by the way, it's getting worse every few months.
[15:26.000 --> 15:32.000]  What about all the people that are innocent who didn't even know they were taking fentanyl?
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  Because I want to warn young people out there.
[15:35.000 --> 15:40.000]  It's not never a big drug guy, but in high school and college I tried this, I tried that, I never stuck a needle in my arm,
[15:40.000 --> 15:45.000]  but I tried cocaine a couple of times, tried methamphetamine, you know, tried things that always did not like it.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  That's why I never did it again.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  But you can't experiment with anything.
[15:50.000 --> 15:53.000]  Not pills, not somebody tells you it's ecstasy, anything, young people.
[15:53.000 --> 15:57.000]  Don't do anything. You cannot take anything.
[15:57.000 --> 16:26.000]  We'll be right back.
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  We have the amazing Dr. Jones naturals, turmeric toothpaste, it's so much more.

[18:41.000 --> 18:46.000]  And the final 1200 signed copies of my book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[18:46.000 --> 18:50.000]  and I'm not going to sign any more after that, are exclusively available at InfowarsStore.com as well.
[18:50.000 --> 18:54.000]  In the last month, I got a little busy, so I didn't sign the books, we didn't have them for sale.
[18:54.000 --> 19:20.000]  But now, I sign the last books, you get them right now.
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.000]  They took the babies out of 80 bears, and left the children to die on a cold spot.
[19:28.000 --> 19:32.000]  It was almost as if it were a plan in motion to get your tank hit.
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.000]  We need to go into the capitol, set, set, set!
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories, they are nothing but distract.
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors, you silenced those voices.
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[19:48.000 --> 19:56.000]  As soon as we start exposing The Great Reset, as soon as these globalists start going to prison!
[20:18.000 --> 20:26.000]  The World is in Deep Crisis. Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[20:26.000 --> 20:36.000]  Here at TV Viewer, we have the set lit up as Washington DC, what it would look like
[20:36.000 --> 20:42.000]  after a hydrogen bomb detonated over it.
[20:42.000 --> 20:48.000]  That's really the future that I'm trying to avoid, and I think most of us here don't want to be in.
[20:48.000 --> 20:52.000]  I'm going to replace this background with the American flag.
[20:52.000 --> 21:00.000]  And the better things this country stands for than fentanyl and drag queen pedophile time and the New World Order.
[21:00.000 --> 21:02.000]  So next segment, we'll go with the American flag.
[21:02.000 --> 21:07.000]  I know I said go with this background because it is the destruction of our republic, we're witnessing,
[21:07.000 --> 21:11.000]  but I'm going to put up a more hopeful image because things are so dark.
[21:11.000 --> 21:15.000]  Why? Why have things clash?
[21:15.000 --> 21:22.000]  So let's get into the Trump situation, and then I'm going to open the phones up in the next two segments.
[21:22.000 --> 21:24.000]  I'm going to take six, seven calls.
[21:24.000 --> 21:31.000]  I want to hear from you ahead of Robert Barnes joining us on the impending Trump indictment.
[21:31.000 --> 21:37.000]  Now they're saying that the George Soros DA may get cold feet because even the feds didn't charge Trump with this,
[21:37.000 --> 21:45.000]  and it's not a state felony, but they've made it a felony, and so how are they even doing that?
[21:45.000 --> 21:51.000]  No president's ever been charged, and the reason no former or current president has ever been charged
[21:51.000 --> 21:57.000]  is that any district attorney could remove a president any time they wanted, basically.
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  That's why presidents have veto power.
[21:59.000 --> 22:05.000]  It's why they have the power of the pardon because you've got to have a separation of powers in the government.
[22:05.000 --> 22:08.000]  It doesn't mean a president's above the law, they can be impeached,
[22:08.000 --> 22:15.000]  but there's never been a charge where anyone was willing to go that far to do it because it's so dangerous.
[22:15.000 --> 22:24.000]  And I'll hand it to DeSantis that he came out to Trump's defense and said this is wrong in a constitutional crisis,
[22:24.000 --> 22:30.000]  even though Trump is his main political adversary.
[22:30.000 --> 22:33.000]  But DeSantis also understands the numbers.
[22:33.000 --> 22:41.000]  Trump, just since this started, has gone from a dead heat in polls with DeSantis to at least 15 points on average ahead of him,
[22:41.000 --> 22:49.000]  and will be a political suicide for DeSantis not to do this because this is a question that's been fought for 240 years in the courts,
[22:49.000 --> 22:54.000]  and it's been a common-sense decision that you do not indict current or former presidents.
[22:54.000 --> 23:00.000]  It opens too big a can of worms and allows voters to have their will of who they're going to vote for blocked,
[23:00.000 --> 23:05.000]  and with Trump being the front-runner in the presidential field,
[23:05.000 --> 23:09.000]  and the Republican nomination department,
[23:09.000 --> 23:14.000]  and in any real numbers you look at meeting Democrats easily as well except for election fraud,
[23:14.000 --> 23:19.000]  this will only supercharge you and show why do they do it,
[23:19.000 --> 23:24.000]  because they can't help it and they're hysterical and they want total power.
[23:24.000 --> 23:28.000]  Why do you think Soros would get it over a thousand district attorneys in the country,
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.000]  get them into office with billions of dollars of money,
[23:32.000 --> 23:36.000]  and then have them release mass shooters?
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  Right here where I live in Texas in the last year, two different mass shooters,
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  one in Fort Worth and one in Austin, after they shot multiple people,
[23:45.000 --> 23:51.000]  were released within days from jail by Soros DAs because they were black.
[23:51.000 --> 23:57.000]  That's just cases where I live. It is crazy town, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:57.000 --> 24:03.000]  But at the same time, they let shooters and criminals and murderers and rapists out of jail.
[24:03.000 --> 24:09.000]  They want to prosecute Trump for a seven-year-old supposed crime that's not even been proven,
[24:09.000 --> 24:14.000]  but is alleged of paying off a high-end hooker.
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.000]  Not like she's 17 years old or 16. Boy, I'd be against Trump in two seconds right there.
[24:19.000 --> 24:24.000]  A 30-something-year-old woman on the supposedly even went on.
[24:24.000 --> 24:31.000]  So it's just crazy, and Trump never claimed to be lily pure.
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.000]  Trump basically, it's well known as a womanizer. So who'd you think you were electing?
[24:36.000 --> 24:40.000]  At least he wasn't a hypocrite about it.
[24:40.000 --> 24:47.000]  So New York City braces for unrest after Trump calls for protest over possible arrest indictment.
[24:47.000 --> 24:50.000]  We've got all the clips we'll play one here in a moment of Maxine Water saying,
[24:50.000 --> 24:54.000]  he's mobilizing his terrorist, he's mobilizing his terrorist for violence,
[24:54.000 --> 24:57.000]  but she's the one that actually calls for violence.
[24:57.000 --> 25:01.000]  And listen, I don't think people should be intimidated because of January 6th to protest,
[25:01.000 --> 25:04.000]  but call for peaceful protest.
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.000]  Trump is in his right to say, our country's collapsing, it's in deep trouble.
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  They're destroying the nation at every level.
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  They're destroying our currency, annihilating our borders, starting World War III.
[25:14.000 --> 25:19.000]  You know what he says, but then he says, take back our country, protest.
[25:19.000 --> 25:22.000]  Now that's not a call for violence, but it can be interpreted as that.
[25:22.000 --> 25:29.000]  So when they have provocateurs try to stir people up, they can then demonize everybody else, including Trump.
[25:29.000 --> 25:34.000]  So the press release he put out Friday, you can tell he wrote it, had spelling errors in it, all the rest of it.
[25:34.000 --> 25:43.000]  It's kind of endearing, but not the smartest thing to do to give them any type of cover for what they did on January 6th.
[25:43.000 --> 25:48.000]  Now that's all coming out. I would have added the word peaceful protest.
[25:48.000 --> 25:54.000]  But you can't then not see conservatives or populists or Christians or nationalists protest.
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  Not just this, but all sorts of events.
[25:57.000 --> 26:09.000]  Because of January 6th, we've seen a market massive decrease in protesting and demonstration since January 6th by what you call the Tea Party populist nationalist because of that.
[26:09.000 --> 26:16.000]  And we can't let ourselves be intimidated just because we got tricked into a few thousand people.
[26:16.000 --> 26:25.000]  Not even that, maybe a couple hundred being violent, participating in the federal event, the provocateur event of January 6th.
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  But let's continue with these headlines.
[26:27.000 --> 26:33.000]  New York City races for unrest for Trump calls for protests or possible arrest indictment.
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  The Hill reports, don't worry, we'll get Trump.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  There's all sorts of new indictments, both federal and state coming.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  This is just the beginning, that's their plan.
[26:40.000 --> 26:42.000]  Georgia, D.C., you name it.
[26:42.000 --> 26:44.000]  Breaking, is this all a scam?
[26:44.000 --> 26:49.000]  It looks like President Trump will not be arrested Tuesday.
[26:49.000 --> 26:58.000]  Now, talking to mainstream news, sources in the DA's office are saying, well, they have more witnesses to call Monday, and so they're not sure now.
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.000]  Well, it would be a smart move for everybody not to do that.
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  Unless they just want to supercharge Trump even more.
[27:05.000 --> 27:17.000]  The identity of Monday's surprise witness testifying for New York Grand Jury revealed, President Trump says witnesses will supposedly present inclusive, irrefutable evidence clearing him.
[27:17.000 --> 27:28.000]  So now they suddenly want to hear Trump's witnesses, because I think the same people in the federal government that killed the federal indictment of Trump understand that this isn't even good for the deep state, folks.
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  And it's certainly not good for the general public.
[27:30.000 --> 27:34.000]  We need to stop the escalation of destabilization.
[27:34.000 --> 27:35.000]  It needs to stop.
[27:35.000 --> 27:38.000]  No president's been indicted in 240-something years.
[27:38.000 --> 27:41.000]  For a reason, need to follow the president.
[27:41.000 --> 27:44.000]  It needs to not happen.
[27:44.000 --> 27:55.000]  But if you want to see the world go crazy, like some of the sorrow-steep staters do, the same ones start World War III by all means.
[27:55.000 --> 28:00.000]  Let's continue down this insane path.
[28:00.000 --> 28:08.000]  If you want to come back, Nancy Pelosi condemns Trump, reckless push or arrest protest, and Maxine Waters and the rest of it.
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  How dare them imply protests are somehow bad?
[28:12.000 --> 28:15.000]  Because they claim this is a legitimate indictment.
[28:15.000 --> 28:24.000]  Well, whether it's legitimate or illegitimate, it's obviously illegitimate, to the statute of limitations front, then it's your right to protest.
[28:24.000 --> 28:27.000]  Even if you're wrong, you're allowed to protest.
[28:27.000 --> 28:34.000]  So the idea that, well, you're not the right so you don't get to protest, that's what Sam Harris actually says in a new video coming up.
[28:34.000 --> 28:41.000]  We'll talk about it all with Robert Barnes in about 30 minutes, but I want to give the number out and take your calls on the Trump Indictment Arrest Watch.
[28:41.000 --> 28:50.000]  Numbers 877-789-2539, 877-789-2539, 877-789-ALEX.
[28:50.000 --> 28:54.000]  All right, folks, it's Monday, March 20, 2023.
[28:54.000 --> 29:00.000]  Big broad guess, rolls forward. Stay with us.
[29:00.000 --> 29:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad had retired dentist and oral surgeon developed.
[29:07.000 --> 29:11.000]  Dr. Jones Natural's turmeric toothpaste that just came into stock.
[29:11.000 --> 29:14.000]  And I got to tell you, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[29:14.000 --> 29:18.000]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth is insane.
[29:18.000 --> 29:23.000]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and does such great things to the body.
[29:23.000 --> 29:26.000]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.
[29:26.000 --> 29:28.000]  It is just dynamite.

[30:33.000 --> 30:35.000]  You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[30:35.000 --> 30:39.000]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[30:39.000 --> 30:42.000]  He may be America's best-known conspiracy theorist.
[30:42.000 --> 30:50.000]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.

[33:26.000 --> 33:49.000]  So here is the maniac who three years ago in dozens of speeches on the House floor, on MSNBC, on CNN, in the streets,
[33:49.000 --> 33:57.000]  called for people to go out and be violent and confront Republicans and get in their faces and praise the mostly peaceful protesters burning down
[33:57.000 --> 34:02.000]  two and a half billion dollars of stuff killing over 100 people, including seven police officers.
[34:02.000 --> 34:10.000]  I mean, antifa members shot dozens of people in the back or in their cars, over 100 deaths, and it would just be a blip on the radar screen.
[34:10.000 --> 34:20.000]  Two weeks ago, they attacked the new police training center in Atlanta, burning down part of the building and cars and bulldozers and firing improvised explosive devices
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.000]  at the police, not even a blip on the radar screen, and now they're like, oh, he called for protest.
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  It's the end of the world.
[34:27.000 --> 34:31.000]  Trump's gonna, oh, he's mobilizing his terrorists.
[34:31.000 --> 34:36.000]  Listen, lady, isn't it been a real insurrection on January 6th?
[34:36.000 --> 34:43.000]  You didn't know that, sweetheart. And if a million Trump supporters showed up in D.C., there wouldn't be a thing you could do.
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  But we're not like you.
[34:45.000 --> 34:48.000]  We don't want a dictatorship, not yours, not ours.
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  We want our republic back, you wicked woman.
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  Here she is.
[34:54.000 --> 35:07.000]  Well, I just wanted to, you know, have you to understand that perhaps he was trying to organize the domestic terrorists to protest his arrest.
[35:07.000 --> 35:08.000]  Right.
[35:08.000 --> 35:13.000]  Yeah, and I think we have to be careful about him making that announcement. He's doing it for a reason.
[35:13.000 --> 35:18.000]  Right. And we are being careful about reporting that aspect of his truth social post.
[35:18.000 --> 35:24.000]  But I want to be clear. The former president has not officially been indicted.
[35:24.000 --> 35:34.000]  We, and as a result, we do not know what, if any, charges he could be indicted on until we hear from the Manhattan DA.
[35:34.000 --> 35:37.000]  So did you hear the protesters are terror.
[35:37.000 --> 35:41.000]  So protesting is terror.
[35:41.000 --> 35:50.000]  Trey Gowdy, former federal prosecutor says Manhattan's DA case against President Trump risked the demise of our country.
[35:50.000 --> 35:58.000]  Well, yeah, that's how republics end. Democrats accused Trump of inciting violence as all part of his playbook.
[35:58.000 --> 36:04.000]  DA leading Trump case says rhetoric won't intimidate his office.
[36:04.000 --> 36:08.000]  Trump's call for protest gets muted. Reaction by supporters. Yeah.
[36:08.000 --> 36:14.000]  They think they're going to be set up like January 6. Well, it's going to be a lot harder now.
[36:14.000 --> 36:20.000]  We thought Antifa might bomb us or attack us on January 6, 2021.
[36:20.000 --> 36:23.000]  We were looking for that.
[36:23.000 --> 36:28.000]  Instead, they put provocateurs in our midst and got a tiny fraction of people to actually go into the Capitol.
[36:28.000 --> 36:31.000]  But that's all come out now.
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.000]  But people do need to protest and to demonstrate not just this, but open borders and fentanyl and World War three.
[36:37.000 --> 36:44.000]  So don't let Maxine Waters say you're a terrorist. We protest and don't listen to that intimidation.
[36:44.000 --> 36:52.000]  All right, let's open the phones up ahead of Robert Barnes joining us to cover this big subject with the Trump indictment, arrest watch and more.
[36:52.000 --> 36:58.000]  But just on the statute of limitations and the fact they've had to change this from a misdemeanor in New York.
[36:58.000 --> 37:00.000]  DA says he can do that. I really can't.
[37:00.000 --> 37:16.000]  That alone makes it a stunt. Even if he gets a controlled jury, even if they convict him, there's no appeals court in the country that's going to uphold something with statute of limitations is absolutely clear.
[37:16.000 --> 37:18.000]  So again, why are they doing it?
[37:18.000 --> 37:25.000]  Because all these other DAs are scared to do it. They've all got their cooked up cases in DC and Georgia and a bunch of other places.
[37:25.000 --> 37:35.000]  So they want somebody to jump off the cliff first and maybe the DA starting to second.
[37:35.000 --> 37:41.000]  Guess himself a little bit here because he want to be the first idiot to jump.
[37:41.000 --> 37:46.000]  All right, let's talk to Brett in Maine. You're on the air, Brett.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  How you doing? Good sir. Go ahead.
[37:49.000 --> 37:58.000]  Yeah, I just wanted to bring up, I mean, I myself have voted for Trump twice. I used to live in California. I'm from Maine originally.
[37:58.000 --> 38:05.000]  And I've kind of seen the gamut of how it's been under Trump's presidency, especially wearing a Trump hat in California and things like that.
[38:05.000 --> 38:19.000]  But I also am kind of concerned with this DeSantis-Trump war that's kind of evolved in front of us. And I, from a very long time ago, have kind of had Roger Stone's position of Yale people's fed,
[38:19.000 --> 38:25.000]  especially people who are openly part of the St. Elmo society, like from DeSantis's.
[38:25.000 --> 38:37.000]  But at the same time, we can't be leveling the same criticism that we would against Trump in five, six months ago against DeSantis now and acting like it's something different.
[38:37.000 --> 38:43.000]  Like a lot of things Trump promised us that he would do this whole like, you know, Caesar versus Augustus kind of thing.
[38:43.000 --> 38:51.000]  He wasn't Caesar. He had his chance. He didn't do anything with it. His administration, just in the people around him alone,
[38:51.000 --> 38:59.000]  Ron DeSantis is already doing so much better than him. He's populating people around him with people who we would generally agree with for the most part.
[38:59.000 --> 39:08.000]  I don't know if we can really trust Trump, even if he's our guy and he's so wonderful. And this indictment, you know, it passes over him and nothing happens and he gets back in office.
[39:08.000 --> 39:15.000]  Can we really trust him with all the power to really do anything? And I think, like, I don't trust DeSantis at all.
[39:15.000 --> 39:24.000]  But at the same rate, I think he's trying to make a name for himself and I trust him to do more things in office than I actually trust Trump to do.
[39:24.000 --> 39:32.000]  All right. Interesting points. Appreciate your call. Let's go ahead and talk to Tom in Canada. You're on the air talking about the Trump indictment. Go ahead.
[39:32.000 --> 39:49.000]  Hey, Alex, this indictment is bad news for the United States that you have mentioned. However, Trump's coming up on his 80th birthday. The guy's getting pretty old. I think it's time for DeSantis to really make a run at the presidency.
[39:49.000 --> 39:54.000]  I'd like to see Trump be his VP. What's your take on that?
[39:54.000 --> 40:03.000]  You know, I don't think the two are going to work together. I've heard this talk that they're supposedly in some secret alliance. I don't buy it. I don't want to put all my hope into any one man.
[40:03.000 --> 40:14.000]  I think I put it into the people working, you know, through God's will to restore a Republican, you know, fix our planet. But I'm just asking the Democrats, what are you thinking?
[40:14.000 --> 40:24.000]  Because indicting Trump will ensure he gets the nomination. And so why are they doing it? Well, I don't think they're working with Trump. I've been around these people. I've dealt with them myself.
[40:24.000 --> 40:39.000]  They are completely crazed and hate Trump's guts. And so just like Hillary, they came out, told the networks, I want you to make Trump the frontrunner because she thought she could beat him easily.
[40:39.000 --> 40:48.000]  And he beat her. So Trump never ran for office, ran once in one. And I think the way things are going, we're going to end up with Trump as president again.
[40:48.000 --> 40:58.000]  My concerns are the way he energizes the left to commit even more crimes than usual, just to, you know, to try to spike the country.
[40:58.000 --> 41:08.000]  So I think we're in for an incredible next few years, my friend. Thank you for the call. Brandon and Georgia, what's your view on the looming Trump indictment?
[41:08.000 --> 41:24.000]  Yes, sir. Honored to talk to you. I'm a first-time caller. I really haven't heard anybody make this point or argument, this conundrum with the secret service and the US code to protect the president at all times.
[41:24.000 --> 41:30.000]  If he gets arrested, how is that going to conflict with the protection side?
[41:30.000 --> 41:40.000]  Well, that's part of the discussion as you have federal laws that are very strong and very established on this. So they're talking about the secret service staying with him in his jail cell.
[41:40.000 --> 41:52.000]  And they're saying if he actually went to prison for it, they have to create a special wing or a special area and that the secret service would guard him and live with him.
[41:52.000 --> 41:59.000]  Okay, yeah. That's one thing I was thinking about. They couldn't just throw him in, you know, general pop.
[41:59.000 --> 42:08.000]  Well, whether it was the Roman Empire or any other empire or Napoleon, they didn't throw Napoleon in jail. They locked him on an island with his own troops twice.
[42:08.000 --> 42:13.000]  Once he escaped in the other time, they didn't give him 200 troops, came like five so he couldn't escape.
[42:13.000 --> 42:19.000]  But yeah, I mean, this is a precedent where elites don't like to lock up other elites and set the president where they can be locked up.
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.000]  That's why this is so dangerous. And I'm not even against elites being punished.
[42:23.000 --> 42:31.000]  What I'm saying is once you let the genie out of the bottle, once Pandora's box is open, this always leads to a country collapsing.
[42:31.000 --> 42:38.000]  That's why all these other experts are saying that because this is really bad. It's another sign of how sick this country is.
[42:38.000 --> 42:43.000]  I totally agree. And that's the only point I wanted to bring up, sir. I appreciate your time.
[42:43.000 --> 42:48.000]  Appreciate you getting in on the show. Welcome as a first time caller. Glad to have you.
[42:48.000 --> 42:53.000]  We're going to go to break with Jefferson, Angela, Baldi, Patrick and others.
[42:53.000 --> 42:58.000]  Then Robert Barnes has got a lot to say on this subject and more in the second hour.
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  We'll be right back.
[43:00.000 --> 43:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new toothpaste that my dad a retired dentist and oral surgeon developed.
[43:07.000 --> 43:11.000]  Dr. Joe's natural tumor toothpaste that just came into stock.
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.000]  And I got to tell you, I got samples of this months ago and it is amazing.
[43:14.000 --> 43:18.000]  The way it makes your gums feel, what it does to your mouth is insane.
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory. It does such great things for the body.
[43:23.000 --> 43:28.000]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils. It is just dynamite.
[43:28.000 --> 43:32.000]  It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[43:32.000 --> 43:36.000]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at m4store.com.
[43:36.000 --> 43:39.000]  Dr. Jones natural's turmeric toothpaste.

[45:04.000 --> 45:09.000]  This is their big move. So yeah, you say why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[45:09.000 --> 45:14.000]  He doesn't care. That's not his job. He's not the president of the United States.
[45:14.000 --> 45:21.000]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[45:21.000 --> 45:25.000]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased. They must be opposed.
[45:25.000 --> 45:31.000]  Autocrats only understand one word. No, no, no.
[45:31.000 --> 45:35.000]  Exactly. And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[45:35.000 --> 45:41.000]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses. We say no to you taking our firearms.

[47:15.000 --> 47:29.000]  Here are your calls coming up here on the Alex Jones show, but first here's a couple minutes of what Governor DeSantis said about the looming indictment of former president who really is the current president, Donald John Trump.
[47:29.000 --> 47:42.000]  We wanted to know what your thoughts are on the rumored Trump indictment and if you have any role in it, if charges are brought on him, would you have any role in extradition to New York?
[47:42.000 --> 47:47.000]  I've seen rumors swirl, I have not seen any facts yet, and so I don't know what's going to happen.
[47:47.000 --> 47:53.000]  But I do know this, the Manhattan District Attorney is a Soros-funded prosecutor.
[47:53.000 --> 48:07.000]  And so he, like other Soros-funded prosecutors, they weaponize their office to impose a political agenda on society at the expense of the rule of law and public safety.
[48:07.000 --> 48:11.000]  He has downgraded over 50% of the felonies to misdemeanors.
[48:11.000 --> 48:16.000]  He says he doesn't want to even have jail time for the vast, vast majority of crimes.
[48:16.000 --> 48:23.000]  And what we've seen in Manhattan is we've seen the crime rate go up and we've seen citizens become less safe.
[48:23.000 --> 48:34.000]  And so you're talking about this situation with, and like, I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair.
[48:34.000 --> 48:48.000]  I just, I can't speak to that. But what I can speak to is that if you have a prosecutor who is ignoring crimes happening every single day in his jurisdiction,
[48:48.000 --> 48:57.000]  and he chooses to go back many, many years ago to try to use something about porn star hush money payments,
[48:57.000 --> 49:05.000]  you know, that's an example of pursuing a political agenda and weaponizing the office. And I think that that's fundamentally wrong.
[49:05.000 --> 49:15.000]  I also think it's important to point out when you're talking about these Soros-funded prosecutors, yes, they may do a high-profile politicized prosecution, and that's bad.
[49:15.000 --> 49:32.000]  But the real victims are ordinary New Yorkers, ordinary Americans, and all these different jurisdictions that they get victimized every day because of the reckless political agenda that these Soros DAs bring to their job.
[49:32.000 --> 49:39.000]  They ignore crime and they empower criminals, and that hurts people, hurts a lot of people every single day.
[49:39.000 --> 49:49.000]  The Soros district attorneys are a menace to society, and I'm just glad that I'm the only governor in the country that's actually removed one from office during my tenure.
[49:49.000 --> 49:55.000]  Absolutely. I mean, we talk about Russians meddling in our election when they can't even know how to run their own country, and I put them down.
[49:55.000 --> 50:11.000]  It's just true that Putin can't even administer half this country. It's so big. The Chinese have infiltrated this big time, Chinese communists, but the left of these multinational think tanks and corporations like Soros is open society, they have really taken us over.
[50:11.000 --> 50:17.000]  And I have gotten to enjoy Soros-funded judges and people here in Austin with all the rigged stuff we've gone through.
[50:17.000 --> 50:29.000]  And I mean, these people literally hate the rule of law and due process and their tyrants. And on its face, what Soros has done is illegal.
[50:29.000 --> 50:37.000]  It's a multi-actional crime group that controls almost every major DA in the country.
[50:37.000 --> 50:43.000]  All right, let's go ahead and go back to the calls. Jefferson in Virginia, go ahead and thanks for calling.
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call.
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  Glenn.
[50:49.000 --> 51:06.000]  Yeah, I'm fine that we're not supposed to indict former presidents when they haven't done anything wrong for any significant crime, but we sort of dropped the ball on Woodrow Wilson when he signed into the law the Unconstitutional Federal Banking Act to create the Federal Reserve.
[51:06.000 --> 51:16.000]  The Supreme Court should have stepped in on that. We should have like a national grand jury that can make the Supreme Court hold presidents accountable for doing things that are unconstitutional.
[51:16.000 --> 51:22.000]  No, no, I agree, presidents should not be above the law. It's why we have impeachment. It's why we have Congress with the checks and balances of laws.
[51:22.000 --> 51:25.000]  And it's why we have the Supreme Court.
[51:25.000 --> 51:35.000]  I mean, I agree that we, I'm just saying you can't have an average DA indict a president. I mean, it's just, it just, it creates a constitutional crisis.
[51:35.000 --> 51:45.000]  Right. Yeah, it should happen at a much higher level and the people should be behind the indictment, not some DA. But Lyndon Johnson certainly should have been indicted for JFK's assassination.
[51:45.000 --> 51:48.000]  There should have been a criminal investigation at the highest level.
[51:48.000 --> 51:58.000]  And that was a good DA, Jim Garrison, doing what he did, but he was never, he was trying to indict the minions under it to then trigger a federal investigation.
[51:58.000 --> 52:02.000]  But he himself was not trying to indict LBJ.
[52:02.000 --> 52:10.000]  Right. He was, he was going, he was trying to work up the chain, so to speak. But yeah, we need some, some remedy to this.
[52:10.000 --> 52:14.000]  We're, we're, we're behind the curve on this really.
[52:14.000 --> 52:24.000]  No, I agree with you, but what do you think the deep stage thinking to indict Trump? I mean, anybody knows that's going to supercharge him and get him even more support. Why are they doing that?
[52:24.000 --> 52:36.000]  I can't figure out the logic of why they're trying to push this forward. It doesn't make any sense to me. It only emboldens his base. I just, I don't get it myself. It's, they're, they're panicking, I guess.
[52:36.000 --> 52:46.000]  I just don't think they're, they're aware of what they're doing in terms of what their plan is in the long run. They're just sort of ad hoc doing this, flying by their cedar pants.
[52:46.000 --> 52:58.000]  Just like the war with Russia. Eight months ago, Biden's like, we can't send in Abrams tanks. That's World War three. Then he does it. Exactly. They're out of control. It's so dangerous. I appreciate your call.
[52:58.000 --> 53:02.000]  Angela in Wisconsin. Thanks for calling.
[53:02.000 --> 53:03.000]  Good morning, Alex.
[53:03.000 --> 53:04.000]  Hi.
[53:04.000 --> 53:24.000]  I just wanted to, I heard Harrison, the tail end of Harrison's show today, and he did point out something I didn't know, which is that DeSantis actually has the power to stop them from extraditing Trump from Florida for this indictment.
[53:24.000 --> 53:27.000]  I'm not sure if I'm saying it right.
[53:27.000 --> 53:30.000]  No, he does have the power to block the extradition.
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  But I would expect Trump, Trump. Go ahead. Sorry.
[53:35.000 --> 53:51.000]  I'm sorry. That is so significant that I believe, you know, I, I actually emailed DeSantis and I pointed that out. And since the started that article about Maxine waters, I did a true social thing on there.
[53:51.000 --> 54:06.000]  And I had heard or seen a video on band video about Soros, an interview on 60 minutes with Mike Wallace.
[54:06.000 --> 54:13.000]  Now, I couldn't find it. I was strapped for time. My mind was, you know, this popped in my head.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  So I went to YouTube and I found the whole interview.
[54:16.000 --> 54:23.000]  The one you have is a segment of it. So I listened to it and it is so revealing, Alex.
[54:23.000 --> 54:37.000]  The full one's even better of how Soros, from the age 14, he was trained by Nazis, and he is a self-professed, God-rejecting.
[54:37.000 --> 54:42.000]  And like, it's kind of cool because he's real honest and open about who he is and what he is.
[54:42.000 --> 54:57.000]  I mean, and Mike Wallace is just interviewing him saying, okay, so on one hand, it's okay for you to wield your power with money to do what you think is good.
[54:57.000 --> 55:04.000]  But on the other hand, there's so much suffering and blah, blah, blah. It's just like it's mind blowing.
[55:04.000 --> 55:10.000]  And then Soros goes on to say, well, if I don't do these evil things, somebody else will.
[55:10.000 --> 55:13.000]  So he goes, I don't mean to be evil, but it's just the way the market works.
[55:13.000 --> 55:17.000]  So I'm going to fill this place and it was the best time of my life rounding up Jews.
[55:17.000 --> 55:25.000]  Yeah, actually up until about a year ago, they would never allow it on YouTube and no one could find the full Soros clip and all we had was pieces.
[55:25.000 --> 55:33.000]  I noticed about a year ago, it went back on YouTube and then the whole 15 minute interviews there and it's just mind blowing.
[55:33.000 --> 55:38.000]  And in fact, I meant when I saw it last year to come and play the whole thing here on air.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  I never got around to it, but but you're absolutely right.
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  Last time I checked that a whole thing is there.
[55:42.000 --> 55:43.000]  I've never seen the whole thing.
[55:43.000 --> 55:47.000]  It's even worse than the two minutes we had. Thanks for the call.
[55:47.000 --> 55:53.000]  All right, Patrick Baldy and others will take your calls when Robert Barnes is on with us on the same subject.
[55:53.000 --> 55:54.000]  More calls.
[55:54.000 --> 56:02.000]  We'll go ahead and open the phones up for more callers on the Trump indictment, the constitutional crisis, 2024 elections and all the things that are unfolding.
[56:02.000 --> 56:07.000]  877-789-2539, 877-789-2539.
[56:07.000 --> 56:13.000]  I wasn't going to take too many calls, but now that I think about it, I think Barnes will like to take some calls on this subject.
[56:13.000 --> 56:16.000]  So 877-789-2539.
[56:16.000 --> 56:20.000]  Please remember, we're not funded by George Soros and the Globals, we're funded by you.
[56:20.000 --> 56:28.000]  And when you make the decision to go to infowarstore.com and get great life empowering products, it also funds this operation which changes the world.
[56:28.000 --> 56:35.000]  So it is a default position for me in my mind that you would want to get these great products and you'd want to keep us on the air.
[56:35.000 --> 56:40.000]  So please take action, want to thank those of you that have, want to encourage those of you that have never gone to infowarstore.com to go there.
[56:40.000 --> 56:47.000]  And maybe you don't want turmeric 95, the strongest curcuminoid product out there.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  Maybe you don't want our super high-end CBD oil.
[56:49.000 --> 56:54.000]  It's great for your neurological system, nervous system, bones, joints, arthritis and more.
[56:54.000 --> 56:57.000]  More than 50% off what it sold in stores.
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  It's been third-party tested, it's the highest grade.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  Maybe you don't want our ultimate bone broth.
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  Maybe you don't want our great prebiotic.
[57:03.000 --> 57:12.000]  Maybe you don't want basso beets and our highest quality fizzing magnesium power that's so good for your sleep and your overall health and your muscles.
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  But maybe you just want to make a straight donation.
[57:14.000 --> 57:18.000]  Just donate up at the top, $5, $10, $100, $20.
[57:18.000 --> 57:22.000]  You can do a recurring donation every month or every two months.
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  And your profile, cancel any time.
[57:24.000 --> 57:29.000]  Any time you set up for auto-ship for a product you'd like to be mailed to you at a later date, you get 10% off on that as well.
[57:29.000 --> 57:38.000]  A lot of great products, infowarstore.com will be right back with our number two, infowarstore.com.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  Thank you all for your support.
[57:40.000 --> 58:00.000]  I've got a little report I'm going to play when we come back dealing with critical race theory.
[58:00.000 --> 58:01.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[58:01.000 --> 58:05.000]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[58:05.000 --> 58:08.000]  Alex has been right on court over a decade.
[58:08.000 --> 58:12.000]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[58:14.000 --> 58:18.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[58:18.000 --> 58:22.000]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[58:22.000 --> 58:26.000]  Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[58:26.000 --> 58:28.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax.
[58:28.000 --> 58:30.000]  Not for a second.
[58:30.000 --> 58:32.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[58:32.000 --> 58:35.000]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[58:35.000 --> 58:38.000]  Government, beers, Alex Jones.
[58:38.000 --> 58:43.000]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[58:52.000 --> 58:58.000]  It's hard to believe that we're already going into March 2023 and the world is an insane place.
[58:58.000 --> 59:00.000]  World War III has already started.
[59:00.000 --> 59:03.000]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.
[59:03.000 --> 59:06.000]  In the last censorship, James O'Keefe has been removed from Project Veritas.
[59:06.000 --> 59:08.000]  The list goes on and on of the bad things that are happening.
[59:08.000 --> 59:13.000]  But the good things that are happening is humanity is really accelerating its awakening.
[59:13.000 --> 59:17.000]  But those of us on the forefront are under more attack by the establishment than ever.
[59:17.000 --> 59:21.000]  That's why I'm counting on you to spread the word about the broadcast, to pray for the broadcast
[59:21.000 --> 59:25.000]  and to keep the broadcasts on the air by getting great products at info.org.com.
[59:25.000 --> 59:28.000]  And whether it's a final signed copy, they're almost all sold out.
[59:28.000 --> 59:30.000]  They're the great reset awards of the world.
[59:30.000 --> 59:34.000]  Elon Ross finally back at Stockett for over two years. It's all available at info.org.com.
[59:34.000 --> 59:36.000]  These are truly amazing products.
[59:36.000 --> 59:42.000]  So get your info.org products at info.org.com and enrich your life while keeping the broadcasts on the air.
[59:42.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  And it is your decision whether or not we stay on air. So please take action now at info.org.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:20.000]  So the big think tanks, the UN, all of them are funding critical race theory,
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  not just here but around the Western world that whites are inherently bad people.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:29.000]  Then they bring in giant third world populations and brainwash them that white people are inherently bad.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  That's replacement migration.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  That's an official UN plan going back 15 years that you now see me implemented.
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:41.000]  But the ADL and others say arresting anybody that talks about it, it doesn't exist.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  Well, yes, it does exist. And here's just a few examples in their own words.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:53.000]  Officials believe the gunman accused of the mass shooting in Buffalo was inspired by the white replacement conspiracy theory.
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  Now, this is a baseless belief that white people are being slowly but intentionally replaced by minorities and immigrants.
[01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:06.000]  The concept was once a fringe theory, but now it's embraced by many Republican lawmakers and Fox hosts.
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:11.000]  There's no economic justification whatsoever for these levels of immigration.
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:17.000]  And of course, immigration destabilizes your society. It makes it far less cohesive.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  That's always true. It doesn't matter where they're coming from. If you have a ton of new people, you're less cohesive.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:29.000]  So why are they coming? Well, there's only one reason, because the Democratic Party wants new voters. Period.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  What was once a fringe white supremacist conspiracy theory has now become mainstream.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  The theory has been amplified by voices on Fox News.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  I mean, everyone wants to make a racial issue out of it. Ooh, the white replacement theory. No, no, no.
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  This is a voting rights question. I have less political power because they're importing a brand new electorate.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  Why should I sit back and take that?
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  The racist anti-immigrant theory that says non-white immigrants are being brought to replace America's white population.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000]  That's not a racist conspiracy. It's a racist conspiracy. No, it's not. It's true.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  And we know that it's true, not because we heard on Alex Jones, but because leading Democrats have said so repeatedly in public for years.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:27.000]  It seems harder and harder to ignore that the echoes of replacement theory and other racially motivated views are increasingly coming out into the open.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:33.000]  In a few years, we're going to be a majority brown country. White people will not be the majority in the country anymore.
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  This will be the first generation ever in American history in which whites will be a minority of the generation at some point.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:49.000]  As of 2007, every year babies being born in this country, whites now are the minority. In 2044, everyone is going to be a minority.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  As the demographics change, as white people become the minority in the country, which is coming.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  Demographics is destiny. Demographics is destiny. Demographics is destiny, right? The country is changing.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  I've been saying it here. Other people have been saying it here for years now, even before Donald Trump. The demographics is destiny.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  The white population is declining for the first time in history in America, while the number of multiracial Americans have more than doubled.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  So we live in a country where the demographics are changing. It's becoming less white. Correct.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  Whites will not be the majority. I mean, it's an exciting transformation of the country. It's an exciting evolution and progress of our country in many different ways.
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  The white population is declining. It was always on the upswing. So that speaks to the beautiful diversity of America.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  It speaks to how that population, the demographics, will weigh in politically.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:56.000]  The only way we're going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the dreamers, and all of them.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  Our ultimate goal is to help the dreamers but get a path to citizenship for all 11 million or however many undocumented there are here.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:12.000]  Fewer than 50% of the people in America from then and on will be white European stock.
[01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  They say out loud, we are doing this because it helps us to win elections. That's not something that is said once. It's something they've gloated about again and again and again.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:30.000]  In a couple of presidential cycles, you'll be on election night. You'll be announcing that we're calling the 38 electoral votes of Texas for the Democratic nominee for president.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000]  It's changing. It's going to become a purple state and then a blue state because of demographics.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  Demographics is destiny. Call out Tucker Carlson. Call out the politicians and make them own it. This is a Republican platform. It's the racist Republican replacement theory.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000]  So you play clips of them saying it and you're the deranged conspiracy nut.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:23.000]  Spread the word about the broadcast and get great products to keep us on air and fund our operation while at the same time enriching your life.
[01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:29.000]  Now we've got three new products available at infowarstore.com and a bestseller back at stock.

[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  For all the highest quality products, the prebiotic is now finally back at stock. They're all there at infowarstore.com.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.000]  So please take action now, enrich your life, empower your body, and keep us on air.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:19.000]  Take action now, infowarstore.com.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:25.000]  Well-known constitutional lawyer and, of course, Republican brain.
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  In Saturday you call him. Robert Barnes joins us for the battle. It's the hour.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  We'll also take some calls with the loaded phone lines on the one subject of the looming Trump indictment.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  Is it really going to happen? Is it going to be over storming Daniels?
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  Why are the Democrats at a state level doing this when the feds declined not to do it?
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:49.000]  The issue of the statute of limitations, just all of it is so important.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  Trey Gowdy says the Manhattan D.A. case against Trump risks the demise of our country.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:02.000]  And I agree, but we're going to explain with an expert on the history of this legally, Robert Barnes joining us.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  Robert, great to have you on with us. I've been watching a lot of your work since you were on a few weeks ago.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  You've been killing it, and so congratulations. You've always been successful for many years,
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000]  but you've really been nailing, and I see you everywhere with massive following increasing,
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  which is a good thing. We need more smart people to be more prominent.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]  So it's great to have you here with us. Let's tackle into this.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]  Then obviously it ties into Ukraine. It ties into the banks.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  It ties into Sam Harris and the Democrats saying, yeah, we're for censorship. Big deal. Get used to it.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  You don't deserve to have a voice. And the incredible hearings in the last few weeks in Congress
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:39.000]  with the admitted weaponization and surveillance and censorship.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.000]  And for me, it's not a first amendment issue. That's a side issue. It's an important issue.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  The organized nature of intelligence agencies with government, with think tanks, with big tech, with dinosaur media,
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  working to surveil, censor, and then the platform and debank people.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  To me, that's racketeering, but you've got the legal brain. I want to get your finer point on that.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  So Robert, great to have you with us.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  Oh, absolutely. I mean, the bottom line is the deep state isn't going to indict Trump in order to get DeSantis to challenge Trump.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000]  That that's the story that's not being fully told or has been fully vetted yet, but we'll start to come out over.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:18.000]  And DeSantis' statement today is revelatory of that.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  The fact he's not going to use his Florida governor's powers to even protest or contest such an indictment and arrest
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  is going to pretend that it's inconsequential, that it's a sideshow, that it's a circus, is a, all of this was intended to take out.
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  Soros leaked this, by the way, a couple of months ago.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  The goal was to take out both DeSantis and Trump by getting DeSantis, tricking DeSantis into challenging Trump.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  But the pitch that was made to DeSantis that got him to reverse, he was going to be on the ticket just in the summer of 2022.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  The pitch that got him to reverse was, hey, Trump's going to be taken out by criminal indictments. That's going to pave a path for you to run.
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.000]  Don't align with Trump because that's a dead path.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:02.000]  Challenge Trump because Trump's going to be DOA.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  We're going to guarantee it because he's going to get indicted.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  And they launched four different criminal investigations against him.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  They did Mar-a-Lago classified documents, Georgia election issues, January 6th and New York.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:19.000]  Mark was dead because career prosecutors looked at the case in New York and said, there's no case here.
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  And so they said, don't worry, we got Mar-a-Lago, we got January 6th, we got Georgia.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  But then, of course, Mar-a-Lago blew up on him by the public backlash.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  Not only that, Mar-a-Lago blew up on him again when white hats in the FBI disclosed how Biden had even more classified documents by any estimation.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000]  Biden's only going to commit a real crime in this context, so that made that case die on the vine.
[01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:47.000]  They couldn't get anybody to flip in either Georgia or the D.C. cases to give a credible case against Trump.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  And the grand jury person is a complete nut job who went on CNNX and even no less than Anderson Cooper admitted she was a nut job.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  So that killed those cases.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  So they went back to the Soros elected DA out of New York and said, buddy, you got to revive that dead case.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  So he removed the career prosecutors from the case, put on these heavily political prosecutors on the case.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  I know some of the career prosecutors who said no to the case.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:15.000]  And they said there's no basis for it. It's outside the statute of limitations.
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  It's a made up, manufactured criminal allegation.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  But they have to go forward with it because it's the only way they can trick DeSantis into making political suicide by challenging Trump
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  because they think the only way to take out Trump is to get DeSantis to weaken him so much in the primaries
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:38.000]  that even if Trump wins in the primaries, he's beaten up and vulnerable by the time of the general election.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:41.000]  And they want to take out DeSantis at the same time.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  This was how they tricked and deceived DeSantis because after DeSantis went rogue on the pandemic in terms of deep state priorities,
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:53.000]  they decided they could no longer trust him.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  And even though he'd been a deep state recruited candidate going back to Guantanamo and Harvard and Yale and prep school and the fraternities tied to school and bones,
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:07.000]  he proved that his working class roots and his political pragmatism could go populistic key junctures.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  So they no longer trusted him. So they thought this is genius.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]  At a minimum, we get to take out DeSantis.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:17.000]  Maybe we take out DeSantis and Trump, but the linchpin to all of it is a bogus criminal indictment.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  And all they have left is the Stormy Daniels case.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  But as Clinton, we lived through it when a desperate political prosecutor resorts to just charging sex crimes,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:38.000]  people tend to rally to the victim of that accusation rather than rally to the prosecutor's side as Bill Clinton proved in 1998.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  By reducing Bill Clinton's crimes to just a sex crime, he actually rebounded in political popularity.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000]  Democrats did great in the 98 midterm elections to everybody's shock and surprise.
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  And so I think the empire is going to strike back tomorrow with an indictment on Donald Trump.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000]  But it will be the beginning of the return of the Jedi and the resurrection of Trump's career.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  And maybe DeSantis will get wise and realize he needs to not take the bait and challenge Trump in the first place,
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000]  because he would only be doing the deep state spitting.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  And the numbers show that this is going to supercharge Trump.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:17.000]  But it again shows the clear desperation of these people.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  And every criminal case they've tried to launch against Trump, right at the magic moment,
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  FBI whistleblowers release info, basically showing it's a fraud or showing things Democrats have done a thousand times worse.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  But look, Bill Clinton was not really popular. A lot of people, he was a bad guy.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  But they still went after him on sex crimes because they didn't want to go after him on other issues,
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  because Republicans were involved in a lot of the same issues.
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:45.000]  But with Trump, this is a grown woman.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  There's not allegations that he was beating them or attacking them or raping them like Bill Clinton likes to do.
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  But what about the statute of limitations?
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  If this happened seven years ago and right when the statutes were almost up two years ago,
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000]  the last group, as you pointed out, New York declined, the feds declined,
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:07.000]  then how are they doing this outside of the statute of limitations?
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  There's just gambling that the grand jury will indict a ham sandwich, particularly in Manhattan,
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  so they know they won't pay attention and put a block and stop to the case.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  They're gambling that a New York state court judge, and there's reasons to think they're right,
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  will play ball with the prosecution.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  And so the theory they're going to use is the idea that Trump was both unavailable to be indicted and outside the state,
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  and they need to prove both.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:37.000]  They need to prove they couldn't find him for purposes of indictment and that he was unavailable.
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  There are some bad cases out there in New York case law that can could allow this,
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  but it's not what the law is supposed to be.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:53.000]  So what they're really gambling on is that they'll get a political enough judge that will let Trump not get to dismiss the indictment,
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  drag out the case, and again, I think their real goal isn't even to get a conviction in this case.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:05.000]  Their real goal is to trick DeSantis into challenging Trump thinking that the New York indictment will be enough to derail Trump.
[01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:11.000]  Isn't it also meant to add the first guy to jump off the bridge, the first lemming of the Soros DA,
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:19.000]  to encourage other investigations that have stalled because they're not a case to go ahead and follow their indictments and try to swarm Trump?
[01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  Oh yeah, no doubt about this.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  I mean, they're desperate to take out Trump, but the primary strategy they have is to get DeSantis to challenge him.
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.000]  The backup strategy is to just weaponize the legal system everywhere.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.000]  And they did this to him his whole term.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  They're subject to several bogus criminal investigations.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.000]  Remember, any time he, like some people are being critical of him related to Ukraine,
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:45.000]  well, any time he tried to put a halt to aid to Ukraine or sending money to Ukraine or sending arms to Ukraine, they impeached him.
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  I mean, that was what the first impeachment was all about.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  They neutered him.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  Completely.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:59.000]  And even before that, they were scared of him reaching a rapprochement with Putin and Russia that would create an allied relationship with Russia
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  to separate them from China.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.000]  And we just saw this past week how Biden's strategy is backfired, as Xi is hanging out in Moscow with Putin.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  And how do they do it?
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  A bogus criminal investigation.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  Well, Robert, let's talk about that when we come back.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  But I want to finish up on the indictment situation.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  You do think indeed they're going to go ahead, despite these new witnesses today, and they're going to go ahead and indict Trump tomorrow?
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  Yes.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  I mean, they're already putting out the steel barriers outside the Manhattan courthouse.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  And they only do that when a high-profile person is going to come in.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  I've been there like three different times where that's occurred.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  So when you see those barriers going up, it means they believe that tomorrow he's going to be indicted.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  Another question.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  Could it just be the stormy Daniels or could there be surprise indictments?
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  It's indicated talk show host, lawyer, good friend of mine, Robert Barnes with us straight ahead, infowars.com. Tomorrow's news today. Your calls and more coming up. Stay with us.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:10.000]  I want you all to know something. Alex Jones was right.
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:14.000]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down. Alex Jones was right.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:34.000]  Alex Jones called this years ago. Years ago.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  The government, beers, Alex Jones.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  I'm a huge believer in information. I watch infowars every day and follow Alex Jones closely. You know why?
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:10.000]  He can push ahead of the curve and he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:13.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:18.000]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:23.000]  This is reality.
[01:17:23.000 --> 01:17:25.000]  It just has been.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:27.000]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming and when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.000]  You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:38.000]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:41.000]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:49.000]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.000]  We're going to get fired up about the real thing, the things that matter.

[01:20:18.000 --> 01:20:23.000]  12.20 Central Time Broadcasting Live from Deep in the Heart of Texas Worldwide.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:27.000]  Robert Barnes is our guest.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:28.000]  Barnes, finishing up.
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.000]  I had that question before we went to break.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:43.000]  I mean, I raised several big questions there, but why doesn't the deep state understand what even the ancients knew that they're making martyrs out of people doing this, but they just can't help themselves?
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:47.000]  Why are they moving to indict Trump tomorrow?
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:55.000]  The primary objective is they figure they'll at least take out the Santas because this is what was promised to the Santas in order to induce the Santas to run.
[01:20:55.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  And they figure they'll get at least that benefit, even if it doesn't damage Trump.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  Secondly, they're delusional too, though.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:16.000]  That can't be underestimated in the same way that they believe constantly coming after you and coming after infowars will get the audience to go away, will get you to forfeit and give up and go sit in a ranch someplace and be quiet and not talk anymore.
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000]  And it doesn't happen.
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  Instead, the audience gets bigger.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:20.000]  The audience grows stronger.
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  The audience continues to go to infowarsstore.com and buy products that make the network stronger, that make the information stronger and make themselves personally healthier.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  They can't stop it.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  They can't stop the message.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:34.000]  They can't stop the messenger.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  They can't stop the audience.
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:43.000]  And they should know that, in fact, it tends to backfire, but it's because they know that they tend to confession through projection, just as they confess their own crimes.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  Like, you go through all the things they accuse Trump of, Biden is pretty much guilty of all the way through, you know, family criminality, corruption, foreign overseas, corruption connected to Ukraine, World War III, all those things Biden is guilty of.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000]  Oh, yeah, they're claiming Trump has secret bank accounts, and now they've got all those numbers.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  He doesn't.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000]  The New York Times basically said, I have secret bank accounts in the Caymans.
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  Totally made up.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:05.000]  100% not true, but they don't care.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  Oh, completely.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  And so I think that's the other aspect, they confess their own fears through projection.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:24.000]  So they think that if they were in Trump's shoes, and somebody came after them criminally, they would shut up, go silent, go mute, go quiet, play ball, do what the system tells them to do.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  And so they assume Trump would do the same, and they don't understand Trump will never do that.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:33.000]  Trump's reaction to people coming after him is to fight back twice as hard.
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:38.000]  Trump's reaction to the Empire Strikes Back is going to be return of the Jedi.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000]  We've seen this script before, and that's who Trump is.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:46.000]  They've never understood this because they can't understand Trump because they themselves are cowards and criminals.
[01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  And so they assume everybody else is a coward and a criminal, and they act accordingly.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  And when they discover otherwise, they don't know what to do, and that's why they're getting burned.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  I totally agree with you.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:09.000]  How would you, before we get into the geopolitical issues, the banking issues and take calls, describe the state of the left and the globalist worldwide?
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:14.000]  I mean, they have world government summits, and the Elon Musk rebukes them to their face.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:17.000]  International polls show globalists are the most unpopular group.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:21.000]  People now know they're the people in charge ruining our lives, but they just keep doubling down.
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  How would you describe this moment in history right now?
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  You have a corrupt, it's like combine the worst of the British Empire at the beginning of the 19th, beginning of the 20th century with the worst of the Roman Empire towards the end of its collapse.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:46.000]  And that's what you have in the bureaucracies in Brussels and Europe and the globalist and all of their minions in positions of power throughout the West.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:52.000]  You have corrupt, incompetent cowards in key positions of political power.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.000]  You have the millies of the world as the military officials of the United States.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:24:01.000]  People reading about wokeness and whose famous meme is him dressed up looking like a woman.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  So, I mean, that's what you have.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:12.000]  It's a very dangerous time because as we know from history, that's what led to World War I and the complete collapse of four great civilizations.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:20.000]  The Russian Empire, the Turkish Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the German Empire to a large degree, even the British Empire.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:27.000]  I was about to say, the British won World War I, which they started, but it was a period victory that later brought their empire down.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  Completely. And that's what you're seeing the same thing is.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  I mean, take the European Union. European Union has gone from 30% of the world's GDP when it was just the year it's much smaller version of the European Community Organization.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:41.000]  Now it's almost less than 10% of GDP.
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  World GDP is it's much bigger and broader.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:47.000]  Why? Because these bureaucrats are corrupt cowards.
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  And they're incompetent. They're incapable. Even Kissinger has been warning about this in places like Ukraine and other places where he said we should be getting out rather than getting deeper in.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:24:59.000]  And that's where we see, you know, we see Xi going to Putin.
[01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  And what it's shown is they had the same estimation of Putin.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  They thought Putin would be intimidated, that Putin would be threatened, that Putin was kind of a coward and he would capitulate if they escalated economic sanctions.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.000]  Now they've issued a bogus international criminal court warrant again for his arrest.
[01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:20.000]  I mean, this is at the same time they're going after Trump, but Putin doesn't respond that way.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  It's like whatever people think of Putin, he's not a coward.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:26.000]  So the idea that he would react this way is dumb.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  And so this is bad politics. This is dumb politics.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  And what we're seeing is a dangerous politics because when you're over open political weaponization of the legal system like they did in trying to go after you in ways that expose the legal system, not you.
[01:25:40.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  Now they're doing with Trump, which is exposing the criminal justice system, not Trump.
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:48.000]  Everybody knows this is a political prosecution.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  There's nobody who thinks this is a sincere justified case.
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  Obama committed massive campaign finance violations, paid major fines.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:58.000]  Nobody talked about putting him in prison.
[01:25:58.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  Hillary Clinton committed massive violations, including the Russia Gates Steel dossier, was a massive money laundering criminal conspiracy involving Mark Ellis and Perkins Co.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  The big Democratic law firms at the time.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  And yet did she go to jail?
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  No, she just paid a few fines to the FEC.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  Well, let's expand on that.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  Let's expand on that.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  And in time to what you just said, take SVB.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  Now the New York Times and Washington Post are blaming right wing groups who did not support the banks, transgenderism and critical race theory and 74 million of Black Lives Matter.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  They're now claiming that's why it went under.
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  Though regulators even have to admit now they weren't even keeping ballot sheets.
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  They were running it like drunken sailors, which goes back to the incompetence.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:46.000]  They literally use wokeism as the cover for everything they do for their incompetence, but it's them destroying themselves.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  Absolutely.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:54.000]  I mean, you're seeing in Hollywood, you know, the reason why you have such bad writing is because they use wokeism to disguise the fact that they're just bad writers or bad storytellers.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:58.000]  And the bigger story with the banks that we can probably get into a little bit more detail.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:08.000]  But what may be happening behind the scenes is a combination of an attempt to take out the alternative crypto economy from central bank digital controlled central bank digital currency where they want to go.
[01:27:08.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  And part of the predicate to the success of a central bank digital currency is taking out the crypto alternatives to it.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:18.000]  Which was SVB and was signature.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  So the deep state takes out their own banks to stop crypto and then blames us.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  Exactly.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:28.000]  And I think the second stage is they want to consolidate banking power.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  You know, banks, we went from, I mean, we'll remember growing up, there were, you know, 5000 plus banks in the United States.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  They're all kinds of institutions.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  Now there's like 1500.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  They want to shrink that even more.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  What they want to do is do the JP Morgan because the whole key to the financial liquidity crisis, even what happened with signature bank, Silicon Valley bank, these other banks, what they is because big banks wouldn't lend to them.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:56.000]  Even though they could, the big banks could have easily taken care of it, flipped their treasuries around for some cash for liquidity.
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  They wouldn't.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  Instead, they're having to go to the small regional banks are having to go to the Federal Reserve window.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:12.000]  And so the reason that all of this may be happening is big banks are trying to take over all of the financial economy in order to set up the stage for central bank digital currency.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  And they're using the liquidity problems and the incompetency of some of these banks as the pretext to take over and crush small regional banks all across the United States to where we're stuck with only four or five big banks for any of us.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  And they're doing it.
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  These are the big bank.
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  They're doing it to prop themselves up.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000]  I said that Friday when it started a week and a half ago, and I got criticism.
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  Now Janet Yellen last Friday says, no, it's true to Congress.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:42.000]  So it's all very transparent. How do you see this going?
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  When we come back more on Ukraine, more on the banks, more on the weaponization hearings of the deep state against the American people and calls with Robert Barnes.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:58.000]  I'm Alex Jones, band.video.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  The fight against the New World Order is now the top story in the world. The globalist are in deep trouble, but they're striking back with all their deep state operatives to shut down info wars and other true tellers like James O'Keefe, Tucker Carlson, and countless others.

[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:08.000]  Every time I talk to you, you're either like on the border exposing the cartels and like coming under fire or you're on the streets of some American city hanging out with drug addicts and criminals.
[01:32:08.000 --> 01:32:15.000]  Also, you've gone to ground zero of a massive chemical spill. Are you addicted to the danger, Savannah? Have you ever considered that for a second?
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:22.000]  No, I'm addicted to helping my fellow Americans. I'm addicted to spreading the truth. And again, I have info wars to thank for that.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:26.000]  Looking back on the day, I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[01:32:26.000 --> 01:32:32.000]  I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the info wars team.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:41.000]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to, you know, get these types of clips because Alex's whole mentality was, you know, go where the story is.
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:49.000]  Go where the mainstream media refuses to. So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity. I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[01:32:49.000 --> 01:33:04.000]  And I really do credit Alex for, you know, really instilling that within me early on in my career.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:28.000]  All right, Robert Barnes is going to be co-hosting with me into the next hour. We'll start taking your phone calls next segment.
[01:33:28.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  We're going to cover Elon Musk at big developments there, the economy, the weaponization hearings that were so bombshell the last few weeks.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.000]  Incredible. Corporate media didn't cover it, but the internet was on fire with it.
[01:33:38.000 --> 01:33:42.000]  Hundreds of millions of views of those hearings and so much more.
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  But Barnes, this philosophy of the globalist and the left, it caught up their nose despite their face. I know where it comes from at the time.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  When they control the central banks and can issue quadrillions and currency themselves, they have a reckless attitude because they see themselves destroying economies, consolidating power, they vertically integrate.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  But at a certain point they destroy the economy so much that there's real no assets for them to own.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  And if the public's aware that it's globalist doing it all, then their own supporters start to realize that it's a suicide pact.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  People ask why the left in Europe or the U.S. in any city they control run it to the ground with the exact same policies.
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:26.000]  Well, they're auditioning to be a higher-level Davos group person to show they're ready to destroy civilization and build a post-industrial world, which is what the globalists do.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  They're so rich they think they'll be on their high-tech reservations above all the destruction they've created for us.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:38.000]  They'll be in their District 12 while we're all off here in the Hunger Games hinterland, but that's not the way history works.
[01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  It's always a two-way street no matter how rigged it is.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  And I see so many examples of that in my own life, but I see it in the persecution of others that really at the end of the day it's only making us stronger.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  As Nietzsche said, that which does not kill me only makes me stronger as long as we aren't convinced by their wizardry to give up ourselves.
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  Well, exactly. We can look at either history or look at literature. You look at history, you look at what's happening right now in France, mass protest.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  Macron is probably on his way out because he tried to do pension reform and he did pension reform in a way that circumvented the entire French parliament.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:20.000]  Why? Because Macron's probably auditioning for some globalist perk job that doesn't require him to answer to any of the plebs or the people.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:30.000]  But what it's producing is a massive backlash in France that might finally align the populist left and populist right that has been so long divided in France that has allowed the establishment to maintain power.
[01:35:30.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  We already saw populist rebellions take place in Italy, populist success continue unabated in Hungary and in Serbia.
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  We're seeing populist rebellions likely going to take out the Schultz regime just as ultimately it took out the Tories in terms of Boris Johnson because of his Ukraine affectations and his pretend Churchill approach.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  What we see is a common constant approach of elites at the end of a dying empire, so parochial, so provincial, so parasitic that they see their own power often at their own expense and definitely at the expense of the constituents and communities are supposed to serve.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  To use as just one practical illustration, take what is happening in the Sandy Hook cases.
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:20.000]  Here your ethical professional obligation as a lawyer is to maximize the economic benefit to your client or to or whatever your client prioritizes is their interest.
[01:36:20.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  Here in the bankruptcy proceedings, the Sandy Hook Plants parents are being afforded an opportunity for a in my view an extraordinary windfall.
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  And yet it's their own lawyers interfering in that process.
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  It's their own lawyers preventing them from recovery because their own lawyers care more about censoring and silencing info wars and Alex Jones.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  Then they do performing their ethical professional duties to their own clients to maximize potential recovery for those clients.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:37:04.000]  They're the ones sandbagging and sabotaging potential settlements out of the bankruptcy court from what is now public news and public information based on the statements they made after the Connecticut trial based on the statements they made during the Texas trial,
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  which they said was about shutting up and silencing info wars and Alex Jones, not about economic recovery, which is their duty and obligation to the court and their clients and what they said was supposed to be the case of the whole legal proceedings.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  They're committing legal malpractice. The Sandy Hook lawyers are setting themselves up to get sued by their own clients. The Sandy Hook parents ultimate biggest recovery may come from the Sandy Hook plaintiffs lawyers who are sabotaging their own opportunities at settlement.
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  Extraordinary. But why does that happen? Why do you have lawyers betray their own clients? Why do you have elite governors and presidents and premiers and prime ministers betray their own communities and constituencies?
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:56.000]  Because they become obsessed with their own power, even at the ultimate expense of their long term power. I mean, look at what I mean, we blow up Nord Stream to that didn't really hurt Russia.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  Who did it hurt? It hurt the United States and it hurt Germany and the Germany just goes along with it and pretends it didn't happen. The the same justice throughout Europe.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:16.000]  They said, we're going to not let you Russians give us your natural oil and natural gas. Okay, your economy is going to shrink and you're okay. We'll just sell it all to India. That's now booming.
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  Exactly. We'll cut a sweetheart deal with China. So the G is happy. I mean, the China and Russia have been adversaries for centuries, literally centuries.
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  And now you have G and Putin smiling and hugging for the cameras. This is exactly what Trump set out to prevent. Was he not only wanted to ally with Putin on issues of common cause?
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:44.000]  General Flynn had the master plan to cut off China with Obama and Obama didn't follow the plan. Trump was about to play it. And of course, now it's all been screwed up.
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  Just one more thing on my own personal issue and in case. Remember, they asked for $2.7 trillion. I didn't have $3 million in the bank then. I don't have half a million dollars in the bank now.
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:39:04.000]  But the show's bigger and more successful than ever. I never did this for money. I put 95% of the money over the years into the operation, had a little bit of backup money, but they just keep pretending like that New York Times article.
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:14.000]  I read it. Nothing. And it was true. We didn't offer them $44 million, totally made up. I don't have $270 million, totally made up. And they just put things in the paper that none of it's even true.
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  And then the Connecticut lawyers get mad. I saw her in the news saying, oh, we're never going to settle and we're going to get the $1.5 billion. It doesn't exist. I mean, it's, it's, it's, so I don't, none of it even makes sense. It's like crazy.
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  Well, I think that it's the lawyers lying to their own clients with the help of the New York Times. Because I think if you're, if you're one of these plaintiffs and you have the chance for a windfall recovery, but I would call windfall recovery, seven figures.
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  You know, even if it's just a million, two million, whatever it is on the, on the lower end of the scale, but you have a real chance of real money that that for almost all people really matters.
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  So if, but if you're the lawyers and you're the New York Times and what you're really doing is conspiring to silence Alex Jones and Infowars, then you, and that's how you're using this case for that purpose, not actually the case of recovery for these plaintiffs.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  You use these plaintiffs merely as a tool, as a technique, as a tactic to try to achieve this political objective, this ethically impermissible objective, this professional malpractice objective.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  How do you convince the Sandy Hook plaintiffs to stay silent while they lose their chance at economic recovery?
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:38.000]  You convince them there's secretly hundreds of millions of dollars out there. And if we just wait, if we just take time, if we just keep marching and trying to completely destroy Infowars, magically that will lead to gold at the end of the rainbow.
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:44.000]  And you'll actually make a lot more money. They are lying to their clients and they're misleading their clients.
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  So their clients, knowing that there's a real risk that their clients never get paid a penny. If they achieve what they're really out for, which is completely shutting down Infowars, their clients never get paid.
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:41:06.000]  And that's what they have to hide from their clients. Because if they keep, if they're honest with their clients, their clients are going to stop them from doing this. Their clients are going to sue them.
[01:41:06.000 --> 01:41:16.000]  It's clear to me they're committing legal malpractice. It's clear the New York Times is in collusion with these plaintiff, with these corrupt road plaintiffs lawyers. I have no doubt that that is what is in fact taking place.
[01:41:16.000 --> 01:41:24.000]  And the people being screwed over are the people that they claimed were their victims that they were championing the Sandy Hook parents themselves.
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  Well, we now know in hindsight that I was not removed off anything for Sandy Hook covers. It wasn't even the news. It was something I covered years before they sued me, barely covered it. A PR firm took it, blew it up, made it a huge national issue,
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  basically then exaggerated what I said and did to then get the parents basically harassed, make them mad. Then they sue me and then they have judges find us in default because there was no evidence.
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  And the judges then tell the juries I'm guilty to then set this precedent to take not just myself off the air, but Tucker Carlson, everybody else.
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  They're now in the news article saying our goal was to take him off the air and then all other conservatives using this new system of lawfare.
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  They're admitting it in the newspaper that this was their goal. So I'm actually honored that there was this big of a deep state system that set all this up and did all this.
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  But then I realized it wasn't just for Alex Jones. I was the first domino.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  Oh, yeah, you were the template just like you're the template for social media censorship. You're the template for lawfare and Donald Trump is the template.
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:38.000]  If they can come after the president of the United States, the future president of the United States, the leading presidential contestant to the existing president of the United States, then they can destroy any of us.
[01:42:38.000 --> 01:42:50.000]  That's what their goal is to prove to the world that not only that they take out Trump, take out the Santas in one clean sweep, but if they can take Trump out, they can take you out anytime they want, anywhere they want.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  That's why defending Trump is critical for all of our people.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:58.000]  That's right. This is the modern form of political assassination into the legal system. We'll be right back.
[01:42:58.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  I'm a huge believer in information I watch for wars every day and follow Alex Jones closely. You know why? He can push ahead of the curve and he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:18.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys have been awake for like decades.
[01:43:18.000 --> 01:43:22.000]  Alex has been right on toward over a decade.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:28.000]  This is reality. Truth is stranger than fiction.
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming and when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:38.000]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:41.000]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[01:43:41.000 --> 01:43:49.000]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:53.000]  We're going to get fired on about the real thing, the things that matter.
[01:44:19.000 --> 01:44:23.000]  It's a CIA that manipulates the news in the United States.
[01:44:23.000 --> 01:44:27.000]  It took the babies out of 80 years and left the children to die on the cold floor.
[01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:31.000]  It was almost as if it were a plan in full potential.
[01:44:31.000 --> 01:44:34.000]  We need to go into the capitol.
[01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:37.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.000]  They are nothing but distract.
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:43.000]  You guys censored Harvard educated doctors. You silenced those voices.
[01:44:43.000 --> 01:44:47.000]  What we want to do in Davos is push to reset.
[01:44:47.000 --> 01:44:54.000]  As soon as we start exposing the Great Reset, the soon as these globalists start going to prison.
[01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:03.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes Info Wars has had.
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:05.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[01:45:05.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  When we talk about the crew at Info Wars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:23.000]  And when we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[01:45:23.000 --> 01:45:27.000]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:31.000]  So for myself, the whole Info Wars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[01:45:31.000 --> 01:45:36.000]  I only encourage you now to realize that Info Wars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[01:45:36.000 --> 01:45:40.000]  I know you spread the word. I know you pray for us and that's wonderful. Keep doing it.
[01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:47.000]  Most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsTour.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:53.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:45:53.000 --> 01:45:58.000]  If just 1% more of you took action at InfoWarsTour.com, our fighting problems will be over.
[01:45:58.000 --> 01:45:59.000]  Please take action now.
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.000]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[01:46:02.000 --> 01:46:07.000]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destiny.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:12.000]  War is something that we can win, but it takes dedication. It takes commitment.
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  That's why I ask listeners, respectively, to go to InfoWarsTour.com and buy great products
[01:46:17.000 --> 01:46:22.000]  that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:29.000]  InfoWarsTour.com to get a signed or unsigned copy of my book, The Great Reset and War for the World.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:34.000]  Ultimate bone broth, back at stock, nitric boost, the amazing CBD oil we have.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:38.000]  That's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:42.000]  It's all available at InfoWarsTour.com, some of the very best products.
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:44.000]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWarsTour.
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:49.000]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years, but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWarsTour.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:54.000]  These are great products that really work and are amazing, plus they keep us on air.
[01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:07.000]  So again, please take action, go to InfoWarsTour.com today, and I thank you.
[01:47:24.000 --> 01:47:27.000]  Callers, we're going to be going to you this segment into the next hour.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:32.000]  Robert Barnes riding shotgun with us on Alex Jones, your host.
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  One thing the New York Times got wrong, amongst almost everything else they got wrong,
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:39.000]  and their big hit piece has been put all over every newspaper I've seen,
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:44.000]  and it's everywhere, including in the local statesmen, is that we're booming here
[01:47:44.000 --> 01:47:49.000]  and that we've just, rivers of money and rivers of gold and rivers of diamonds.
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.000]  None of that's true.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:55.000]  It's kind of apropos that InfoWars is barely paying the bills,
[01:47:55.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  so they're wanting all this money that doesn't exist,
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  but we don't want to be too good at that and have zero money.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:05.000]  In fact, I'd like to have plenty of money to fight the appeals and move forward.
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:08.000]  There's been big rulings in Texas and federally,
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:14.000]  and almost every mainline analyst, including at the AP, says that their trials will be overturned.
[01:48:14.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  They have to be or there's no First Amendment.
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:17.000]  People say, well, then why are you in bankruptcy?
[01:48:17.000 --> 01:48:22.000]  Because they had weaponized state judges start getting ready to sign orders to seize the infrastructure
[01:48:22.000 --> 01:48:25.000]  and close the building, and they said that that was their plan.
[01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.000]  And so we were out of money. It is a real bankruptcy,
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:31.000]  but listeners then thought, oh my God, you are going under,
[01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:33.000]  and that almost created what they wanted.
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:37.000]  Massive support was withdrawn six, eight months ago when the bankruptcies began.
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  People really thought we were going to be closing.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.000]  No, it's Chapter 11, Sub Chapter 5, which is a reorganization.
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:48.000]  I want to just make that announcement to listeners again that this is all in 100% good faith
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  to put my cards on the table and to try to come to some settlement issue with these people
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  based on reality to close that chapter and move on so info works to be more effective at getting truth out than ever.
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  But if they don't go along with that, then it's all in the law that we will move forward with a settlement trust
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:09.000]  so that any profits are put into a settlement trust in the future on the appeals that are three to four years,
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:12.000]  and almost every expert agrees they will lose.
[01:49:12.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  I don't talk about us personally anymore, but I get the questions all the time in text messages and on the street,
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:18.000]  and you know, the crew asks me all the time.
[01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:23.000]  Any other points you want to add on that, Barnes? We'll go to calls, start the next hour again with all the other news.
[01:49:23.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  Just at the key is the audience. The whole goal was to separate the audience.
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:32.000]  The same way that the Trump indictment is trying to separate Trump from his audience, from his base, from his supporters.
[01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:39.000]  The goal of the Lawfare Against Alex Jones at Info Wars was all about stopping the audience from having its voice heard
[01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  through Alex Jones, through Info Wars, through sharing the links, through continuing to support it.
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:48.000]  That's what they explicitly said in the Connecticut press conference right after the Connecticut verdict.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  They made an explicit and express call, please Info Wars supporters, stop supporting Info Wars.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:49:59.000]  So if you want to continue to get back at protecting the First Amendment,
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  and continue to support independent populist information that was ahead of the curve on almost everything,
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  whether it was global war, whether it was the pandemic, whether it was Epstein,
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  whether it was any of these scandals, whether it was the Biden family, whether it was Biden's bad health.
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:16.000]  There was a reason people forget that's why they kicked off of Instagram.
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  You exposed Biden's first one to expose Biden's serious health problems,
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:23.000]  which now are a constant meme and source of comedy.
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:28.000]  The best way to do that is to continue to support Info Wars at infowarstore.com.
[01:50:28.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  And I speak from personal lived experience.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:37.000]  I've been a supporter for the better part of a decade, I continue to, mostly because it's great products at a great price.
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:45.000]  But I love supporting something that keeps free populist information on the air out to the American people.
[01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  This is a perspective you don't get anywhere else if you want to keep it.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:54.000]  If you want to keep the First Amendment, if you want to keep this voice on the air, continue to support infowarstore.com.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  Find something you like that you need anyway at an affordable, accessible price and get back at the deep state,
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:06.000]  because this is still the best public tool against the deep state that exists.
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:09.000]  That's the reason why it was such a target for the last half decade.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  I want to go to calls, but I took my parents out to dinner last night and when I was leaving,
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:20.000]  an older man came over and he said, listen, I'm a local bank executive,
[01:51:20.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  and he mentioned the bank's pretty big Texas bank, and he said, I want to know how you knew a week and a half ago.
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  This was a plan for the central bank digital currencies that they weren't going to extend lending to small and regional lending banks.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.000]  How did you know that?
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:38.000]  He said, I saw the clips on Twitter and I wasn't sure if you were right.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.000]  And then I saw Tucker the next week and I saw others.
[01:51:40.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  How did you know?
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  And I just gave him like a one minute summation.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:47.000]  And I said, it's the globalist policy to consolidate power, vertically integrate.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:54.000]  He goes, yeah, yeah. And I said, and they want to prepare the way to consolidate power to prop themselves up as a form of quantitative easing
[01:51:54.000 --> 01:51:57.000]  to use new liquidity out of the Federal Reserve.
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:02.000]  But that's only given to the large mega banks to continue that policy of consolidation.
[01:52:02.000 --> 01:52:07.000]  And I knew that they did not prop up SVB when they could have done it for a couple of million dollars.
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:09.000]  So they let the contagion grow.
[01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:12.000]  So knowing their past policies, it was easy to call what they did.
[01:52:12.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  And he said, well, yeah, he goes, I just saw two days ago yelling on Friday, admitted all this.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.000]  I just want to know who are your sources.
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  And I said, it's not sources, sir. I live this. I breathe this. I eat this. I sleep this.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:29.000]  And that's why we're almost always right. It's not hard.
[01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.000]  Once you immerse yourself in the policy, you know it.
[01:52:31.000 --> 01:52:35.000]  It's why Barnes doesn't listen to me a lot. I listen to him some. He listens to some.
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:38.000]  But he has basically the same views because he's historical. He's a lawyer.
[01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  He's been around a while. Once you get the perspective without really works, it's the same process.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  It's the same organization, just something that it's expanding.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  And so that's my main message is once people get how this works, then everything makes sense.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:53:00.000]  If you don't know how politics really works and buy into the pop version of it, nothing ever makes sense.
[01:53:00.000 --> 01:53:02.000]  It's designed to confound you. It's a smoke screen.
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  But what we are is like radar. You can have all the smoke you want, but radar sees right through it.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:10.000]  And that's really why M4 Wars is so valuable is we really get their plan.
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:13.000]  And I don't brag when I say it. It happened in front of my producer.
[01:53:13.000 --> 01:53:18.000]  One of the dozens of times they tried to hire me, but he did it on record and so I can talk about it.
[01:53:18.000 --> 01:53:23.000]  The head of the Kissinger Group tried to get me to go to New York, meet with Henry Kissinger and be bought off by them.
[01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000]  Right at the same time, News Corp was trying to hire me and Roger Ailes and the rest of it.
[01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  So it's not me up here bragging. I'm saying my analysis is so dead on that Henry Kissinger tried to hire me, folks.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.000]  That's what I'm saying is this is real. Notice the whole world they say it's like Alex Jones now.
[01:53:37.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  Oh, Russell Brands, Alex Jones, Joe Rogan's Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson's Alex Jones.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  All these other people are Alex Jones now. Jimmy Dore's Alex Jones.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  No, they're not Alex Jones. They've taken the blinders off.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  They've switched the radar on. So no matter how much smoke screen there is, we can now see what the enemy's doing.
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  Precisely. And being accurate over and over and over again at key and critical junctures has proven that.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:04.000]  But it's also because, as you know, understanding the template, understanding what the pattern is,
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  understanding what the methodologies are, understanding who the motives are, understanding what these participants are up to.
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  And that's critical. And the audience has been leading that.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  It was not a coincidence that the leader, leading protest against the lockdowns, leading protest against mask mandates,
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:23.000]  leading protest against the vaccines and its dangers and inefficiencies.
[01:54:23.000 --> 01:54:32.000]  We're waiting on a federal judge to make a ruling on that motion to dismiss that we held that N4's audience got an exclusive of right after the hearing when I was on,
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  as to that case and its critical, essential nature.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:44.000]  So all of those issues were issues the N4's audience was ahead of the curve on because they spend the time to study and understand what the issues are politically,
[01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:52.000]  what the template is, what the path is, and they understand the world and can foresee the world and can predict the world a lot better
[01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  than the deep state types that are still making the fundamental mistake of believing the world looks like them.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  They think the world is all critical.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:09.000]  I know I was under investigation seven years ago and again five years ago by the FBI, you know, counter espionage groups and others.
[01:55:09.000 --> 01:55:14.000]  And I later had a chance to talk to and run into and meet with a few of these people.
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.000]  And they said, no, no, we know you have no foreign connections and no one advising you.
[01:55:18.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  We were just ordered to because no one believed you knew all this without some type of state sponsoring.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  And what I explained to these people is, you know the states listen to us.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:35.000]  And I want to be clear, it's not Alex Jones, it's my guest, it's the callers, it's the journalist, it's this consortium of all we do is study this.
[01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:44.000]  So anybody that studied this 15 hours a day who doesn't have, you know, brain damage is going to figure it out and the globalists are scared that as soon as their own people figure this out,
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  most of our compartmentalized it's game over because this confusion is key for the system to maintain control of its own people who with this knowledge could easily overtake the system themselves.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:55:58.000]  Completely.
[01:55:58.000 --> 01:56:03.000]  It's what's in common between people like Trump, Orban and Putin, right?
[01:56:03.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  Like whatever people think of either Trump, Orban or Putin, what they all have in common is that they've seen through globalist lies and they know that they can take on globalists and win and succeed.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:21.000]  And what the globalists have done is convinced themselves that these people are like themselves, that they're cowards, that they're corrupt, that they're incapable.
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:29.000]  And the reality is that confession through projection is their biggest venal crime because what it does is it subjects them to failure over and over again.
[01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  We just have to make sure we're not part of the collateral damage when they blow things up.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:44.000]  When they blow up the banking system with the global equity problems we're witnessing around the world, when they're trying to trigger World War III in Ukraine repeatedly and over and over again,
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:51.000]  when they're trying to find, when they're trying to so overtly and openly politically weaponize our legal system through where people no longer have confidence or faith in it.
[01:56:51.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  When they do these things that could have the collateral damage of exploding the whole system, we have to make sure we're not the collateral damage and instead are in a position to take advantage of those situations to do with our founding father.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:08.000]  And what our founding fathers did, which was use it as an opportunity to restore faith and trust in government.
[01:57:08.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  That's right. Our job is not running around setting bombs. It's disarming bombs.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  Exactly. That's exactly right. And there's nobody that does that better than the Info Wars audience.
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  And they do it better by continuing to support Info Wars, keeping it on the air despite all the assaults and attacks, all the lies and all the libels by going to InfoWarsStore.com and finding things they support.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:34.000]  So credit to the audience. Shout out to the audience.

[01:59:59.000 --> 02:00:10.000]  Alright folks, into hour number three with Robert Barnes. I'm your host Alex Jones. Patrick in Massachusetts, thanks for holding your on the ear.
[02:00:10.000 --> 02:00:20.000]  You've got your comments on Trump and protest that Maxine Waters is calling terrorist if you protest. Terriany, go ahead sir.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:30.000]  Yeah, it's Patrick Vincent Dietner, former candidate for state rep mass. You know, it's obvious what's going on here. The January 6th narrative is blowing up in their face.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  And they're trying to manufacture another event like that. But I do think it's interesting. There's a little criticism about how Trump worded his call for protest.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  And I do understand that criticism, but you know, it puts MAGA in a really interesting position to now not take the bait and thus prove that Trump doesn't have some sort of cult-like control over his supporters.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  We can think for ourselves. We can assess the situation, organize peacefully. And you know, if people do feel compelled to protest, I would argue maybe go to your local church and organize a prayer rally or something like that.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:11.000]  Make it signs at home. Power of prayer will work just as well as some, you know, clever words on a sign.
[02:01:11.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  And let me add this. Then put your peaceful rally, whether it's a courthouse or a church or wherever it is, or a party at your house with friends, praying for a new process, praying for justice, praying to save our republic.
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  Shoot it live, stream it live, and millions of people protesting peacefully, all digitally magnifying it will reach hundreds of millions of people.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:41.000]  So many activists think, I'm going to go protest, but not put it out digitally. No, that's the most important part, Barnes.
[02:01:41.000 --> 02:01:58.000]  Oh, absolutely. Exactly. The way the model is the model, the infor's audience used against the lockdowns, which was a combination of in-person protest at the right locations, avoid certain democratic areas, democratic states, counties and cities, do it in other places and other locations generally.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:09.000]  So that's step one to avoid a January 6 entrapment plot. But secondly, the critical point is, you know, can be very loud. There's many ways to protest today, and you can protest digitally.
[02:02:09.000 --> 02:02:19.000]  You can protest physically, but as you know, record it and broadcast it everywhere. You know, Owen Shroyer's little Ukraine thing this weekend, you know, went viral in a bunch of different places.
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  People should not underrate or underestimate their ability to make a difference. There's a reason the FBI was spending time on small Twitter accounts is because small Twitter accounts can have a big impact because they're connected to local people that have real roots in authenticity and organic protest.
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  So there's lots of ways to protest. People should definitely protest, just protest smart and peaceful, use the lockdown infor's model to do so, and that is a combination of physical protest in the right location and digitally be very active in the social.
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  That's right. Let's be clear. You go protest in New York. The Democrats have crazy antifa willing to wrestle like a Trump supporter and throw a fire bomb at police and then say you're part of it because you're there.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  Still shouldn't be intimidated to go out, just be aware, be taping everything. But exactly, we bought the armored vehicle four years ago for $300,000. It paid for itself the first few trips.
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:19.000]  We go to any Trump rally, get all the news attention, then put our key stories out against the New World Order, hijacking the whole Trump narrative, and making him more anti-New World Order, more radical.
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  And yeah, the left of taxes, so we have an armored vehicle. We mainly just get love, but we go to any event, we take over the narrative, whether it's a Beto event, whatever it is, with the armored vehicle, with the loudspeakers, it's a very simple, effective thing to do.
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  And I think county Republican party groups should get an armored vehicle and use it. You take over any event peacefully, you're safe inside of it, and it's what we need to do.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  Oh, exactly. And people should not underestimate their own voice. You know, I often say the greatest trick the devil ever pulled was convincing people he did not exist.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  The greatest trick the system ever pulled is convincing you that you cannot resist. So people should not overreact to January 6th entrapment by saying, oh, now I should be silent. Now I should be mute.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  Now I shouldn't say anything in social media. Now I shouldn't go to inforwarstore.com. Now I shouldn't support inforward. Now I shouldn't go out in public and protest.
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  That would be a mistake. That would be a misread and misinterpretation. Avoid the evidence of entrapment locations and places, but that does not mean you cannot protest physically.
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  That does not mean you cannot protest in the digital social media space. That doesn't mean you can find other ways of effective protest by supporting the networks that support you and support your message.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  Remember, it worked against the lockdowns. It worked against mask mandates. It has ultimately worked in many ways at limiting how many people took the vaccine.
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  A bunch of people didn't give their kid the vaccine because ordinary people in this inforwars audience shared enough information links that prevented them from doing it. So don't underestimate your own voice.
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  That's right. And use it or be a slave. We'll be back in 60 seconds with more phone calls. Baldy, you're up next. Stay with us.
[02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:31.000]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils. It is just dynamite. It is so good to detox and attack inflammation in your mouth.
[02:05:31.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  I want to challenge everybody to try the new toothpaste at inforwardstore.com. Dr. Jones Naturals turmeric toothpaste.
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  And while you're at it, check out the new ashwagandha line of products. We have ashwagandha with black pepper extract for your libido, your testosterone in pill form. And we have the pure ashwagandha root gummies as well.
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:06:10.000]  Now available at inforwardstore.com. They're amazing products and they fund the infowar. Take action now at infowarsstore.com.
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:22.000]  Here are phone calls with Robert Barnes, but I want to just briefly hit on something he just said before the last segment ended. It is not myself that gets the credit, but you need to understand the credit you get audience.
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:29.000]  So you realize how much power you have so that you realize you should do more of what you did. I know that's a very simple statement, but it's profound and true.
[02:06:29.000 --> 02:06:41.000]  This operation was the first to bring on expert guests and analysis that it was made in the lab and to predict what the shot would do with top scientists. We breached the wall because we were already censored off social media.
[02:06:41.000 --> 02:06:53.000]  Everybody else was scared to do it. We weren't. Barnes was right there with us as well with other great researchers and lawyers like Dr. Francis Boyle.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:07:05.000]  We hit the barbed wire as the shock trips of truth. We've been totally vindicated and you listened to us. You did your own research and you did protest all over the country three years ago.
[02:07:05.000 --> 02:07:14.000]  They were going to keep the lockdowns going indefinitely. They admit and I learned this from another prominent lawyer. It's me coming out soon. They're about following a lawsuit over it.
[02:07:14.000 --> 02:07:26.000]  Not on my behalf, but for whistleblowers, a whistleblower from one of the largest, most powerful A tier, A plus tier.
[02:07:26.000 --> 02:07:35.000]  And I was asked not to say the name, but when I say the most powerful, there's only three big global foundations that are the most powerful.
[02:07:35.000 --> 02:07:45.000]  Okay. One of them runs the CIA today publicly, but they have the documents from three years ago, two years ago and six months ago.
[02:07:45.000 --> 02:07:56.000]  And I'm so honored by this, even though it is scary, but I came looking, you know, to take these folks on. So you got to, God gives you your answer, your prayers better be ready for them.
[02:07:56.000 --> 02:08:06.000]  But this major foundation is most concerned about info wars and how we take control of the narratives and they've tracked back to this show.
[02:08:06.000 --> 02:08:16.000]  Literally stopping 90% of what they're doing and triggering everybody else in the chain reaction. So when I say that folks, it's not Alex Jones that saying we're the most effective.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:25.000]  It's one of the three largest, most powerful foundations in the world that basically created the new world order.
[02:08:25.000 --> 02:08:35.000]  Now I'm going a little too far there. I promise I wouldn't say who, but that's a pretty obvious guess created physically where the new world order is.
[02:08:35.000 --> 02:08:40.000]  Okay, now I'm giving it away. The point is, I, most people are like, well, that's really frightening.
[02:08:40.000 --> 02:08:50.000]  But I mean, I asked for it. It's actually very exciting that that literally very soon this is going to be coming out because the folks that told me this have brought forward some of the biggest whistleblowers.
[02:08:50.000 --> 02:08:58.000]  Um, well, I mean, they kind of gave it away. It was a lawyer on there a few weeks ago and he said, Hey, a big groups after you and off air ass you and he gave me the tails.
[02:08:58.000 --> 02:09:06.000]  But the point is, that's when you know you've got real success. You're over the target barns to have one of the big three foundations.
[02:09:06.000 --> 02:09:14.000]  And it's Rockefeller Foundation, Carnegie Endowment, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but but really the most powerful is Carney and Rockefeller and below that's Gates.
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:25.000]  It's really a subgroup of those two to have one of those top three say that I'm the number one enemy or this show is, is I think the greatest reward of my life so far.
[02:09:25.000 --> 02:09:27.000]  What do you think of that?
[02:09:27.000 --> 02:09:36.000]  Oh, I think no doubt. And it's a credit to the audience to their audience is continuing supportive and for the audience continuing embrace and sharing of the message they're doing their own research.
[02:09:36.000 --> 02:09:46.000]  This is why the FBI is now been publicly confirmed by the Twitter files release was following Twitter accounts with as little as 50 followers that like 500 people would read the tweet.
[02:09:46.000 --> 02:10:00.000]  Why? Because they were trying to track the original source of a range of information that took over large parts of the public narrative that changed the position of key position of decision makers even because of it.
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:07.000]  They're like, how did our, how did we fail where we previously succeeded? And they're trying to figure that out the pandemic supposed to lead to the long term lockdowns.
[02:10:07.000 --> 02:10:14.000]  Pandemic supposed to lead to central bank digital currencies and modern monetary theory on a quick and consistent basis.
[02:10:14.000 --> 02:10:18.000]  It was supposed to lead to the destruction of their political opposition.
[02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:20.000]  It was supposed to do a bunch of things that it didn't achieve.
[02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:27.000]  In fact, backfire vaccine strategy backfire more than 90% of parents are not vaccinating using COVID-19.
[02:10:27.000 --> 02:10:32.000]  Well, that's exactly, that's exactly what the foundation documents said is they lead it back here.
[02:10:32.000 --> 02:10:34.000]  So it's not me. It's the audience. It's the guests.
[02:10:34.000 --> 02:10:37.000]  But this is the main breach point their operation folks.
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.000]  This is the place to continue to support because literally the enemy recognizes that.
[02:10:41.000 --> 02:10:45.000]  And I think we all have to recognize that a profit's not known in his own land.
[02:10:45.000 --> 02:10:50.000]  I'm not saying I'm the profit. I'm saying this operation is seen by the enemy as their number one enemy.
[02:10:50.000 --> 02:10:52.000]  All right, let's go ahead and take a call.
[02:10:52.000 --> 02:10:55.000]  Baldy in Florida here on the era of Robert Barnes.
[02:10:55.000 --> 02:10:58.000]  Thank you for the beautiful segue.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:11:02.000]  So first, I just want to just one thing quick.
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:08.000]  Dr. Francis Boyle sat behind Kissinger's desk at Harvard and was groomed,
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.000]  but just like the Santas that does not disqualify him from being a patriot.
[02:11:13.000 --> 02:11:16.000]  We need to judge people what they do on the field and what they do in the arena.
[02:11:16.000 --> 02:11:23.000]  When I first started listening to you, I heard you on coast to coast and I would click on the site and click off real fast because I was scared.
[02:11:23.000 --> 02:11:26.000]  But then I said, you know what? I'm already on that list.
[02:11:26.000 --> 02:11:30.000]  So why not get to the top, top, top of the list?
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:32.000]  And that's what I've been doing ever since.
[02:11:32.000 --> 02:11:34.000]  Thank you for the motivation my whole life.
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:48.000]  You know, I know it's been a scam, a crooked game, but you really, you're either joined the Baptist or Patriots because you're baptized more Patriots in this battle against the New World Order than anybody.
[02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:50.000]  Two quick solutions.
[02:11:50.000 --> 02:11:58.000]  One, if anyone listening to this has money or knows anyone that has money, one of the six big banks.
[02:11:58.000 --> 02:12:04.000]  Take it out now, put it into your local savings and loan, the credit union.
[02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:08.000]  That would do irreversible damage against this.
[02:12:08.000 --> 02:12:10.000]  I don't mean to interrupt you, but that's a great idea.
[02:12:10.000 --> 02:12:15.000]  What if we have a run on big, big banks and put it in little banks, Barnes?
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:17.000]  Well, I think it's also another mechanism of protest.
[02:12:17.000 --> 02:12:19.000]  I mean, look at how the French protests.
[02:12:19.000 --> 02:12:24.000]  So like if people want, they both want to have more stable, reliable savings.
[02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:29.000]  It's always advisable not to have too much money in any fed, fed bank period.
[02:12:29.000 --> 02:12:33.000]  Definitely not any of the big connected fed banks to the Federal Reserve.
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.000]  That's just politically wise in any circumstance.
[02:12:36.000 --> 02:12:44.000]  And it's always good to have some cash and diamonds, some thing, whatever you can to have tangible to have some land and farm and water access.
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:48.000]  There's a range of storeable foods you can get at infostore.com.
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:55.000]  It's always smart to have that backup plan and available because you want the plan and not need it rather than need the plan and not have it.
[02:12:55.000 --> 02:12:57.000]  So that's always sound and sage.
[02:12:57.000 --> 02:13:02.000]  And as to the callers, notice about DeSantis, that's where the deep state concluded.
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:11.000]  They concluded he was not a reliable ally after he went AWOL against the World Economic Forum during the pandemic and came out ultimately even against the vaccine.
[02:13:11.000 --> 02:13:14.000]  And that's why they're trying to trick him into running against Trump.
[02:13:14.000 --> 02:13:19.000]  No, I totally agree with what Baldy said and what you just said. We don't judge people about where they came from.
[02:13:19.000 --> 02:13:27.000]  Saul of Tarsus was the number one persecutor for the Sanhedrin against Christians and he literally became the Christians greatest defender.
[02:13:27.000 --> 02:13:33.000]  And so sometimes, in fact, a lot of the time, God takes evil people who are not totally turned over.
[02:13:33.000 --> 02:13:35.000]  It's like Darth Vader at the end kills Palpatine.
[02:13:35.000 --> 02:13:41.000]  And we have to, when somebody goes our way, whether it's Musk or anybody, we got to give them a chance. Thank you, Baldy. Great points.
[02:13:41.000 --> 02:13:45.000]  Let's go to trucking Tim in Ohio. You're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:13:45.000 --> 02:13:50.000]  Hey, Alex, lovely brother of all the crew, of all the audience.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:55.000]  Two points. One, you're on the fence about the products.
[02:13:55.000 --> 02:14:01.000]  You're only doing yourself with the service because it'll turn your life 180 degrees around.
[02:14:01.000 --> 02:14:03.000]  And you'll never look back.
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:12.000]  Two, he was talking about smoke screens, this whole Trump thing. What are they really doing?
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:17.000]  That's we're being distracted from this Trump.
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:20.000]  And one more thing if I could.
[02:14:20.000 --> 02:14:29.000]  I found somebody that made it quite a great point about the 15 minute cities and all the people that, you know, build the cities and keep them running, which is us.
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:38.000]  We all stand together and refuse to build them, refuse to and call out all the companies supporting them at everything else.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:42.000]  They ain't got to let the things on with these cities, you know.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:48.000]  Now, I totally agree. And people are protesting by the hundreds of thousands of the UK and Europe against them.
[02:14:48.000 --> 02:14:53.000]  And in Canada, I don't know why we're not seeing more protests here. Great point. Anything else, Trucker?
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:59.000]  There's a guy that started a website. It's not up yet, but it's called Blue Collar Boycott.
[02:14:59.000 --> 02:15:08.000]  That will do just that. Call out companies supporting cities, call out the people and basically tell them to go screw themselves when I'm building your city.
[02:15:08.000 --> 02:15:12.000]  Exactly. We should not participate in these anti-human cities. Great point.
[02:15:12.000 --> 02:15:14.000]  Barnes will come back with more calls on the other side. Hit some other news.
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:19.000]  But just in 40 seconds, what do you make of the open rollout of 15 minute cities?
[02:15:19.000 --> 02:15:30.000]  Yeah, I mean, what they did is they took a concept that was a popular urban planning concept and make things accessible and convert it and distorted it into a de facto prison.
[02:15:30.000 --> 02:15:36.000]  So it's extraordinary how they take good ideas, convert them and contort them into terrible ideas.
[02:15:36.000 --> 02:15:45.000]  And then we get what the approach is now, which is to take something that's supposed to make things more accessible and available to you and actually make it less accessible and less available to you.
[02:15:45.000 --> 02:15:52.000]  So they have to be careful whenever they promise something for safety or convenience. Chances are you get neither. You just get the deprivation of liberty.
[02:15:52.000 --> 02:15:58.000]  Sean, you're up next when we come back. Stay with us. Robert Barnes is live.
[02:15:58.000 --> 02:16:05.000]  I'm a huge believer in information. I watch him for wars every day and follow Alex Jones closely. You know why? He can push ahead of the curve.
[02:16:05.000 --> 02:16:09.000]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:16:09.000 --> 02:16:18.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two. Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys have been awake for like decades.
[02:16:18.000 --> 02:16:21.000]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:16:21.000 --> 02:16:24.000]  This is reality. It just can't.
[02:16:24.000 --> 02:16:27.000]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:16:27.000 --> 02:16:32.000]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming and when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[02:16:32.000 --> 02:16:34.000]  You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[02:16:34.000 --> 02:16:37.000]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:40.000]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[02:16:40.000 --> 02:16:48.000]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country, bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.
[02:16:48.000 --> 02:16:52.000]  We're going to get fired up about the real thing, the things that matter.
[02:16:56.000 --> 02:16:58.000]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:02.000]  Thousands of former Nazis went to work for the United States government.
[02:17:02.000 --> 02:17:06.000]  A flying disk has been found and is now in the possession of the Army.
[02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:08.000]  There is a bulletin from CBS News.
[02:17:08.000 --> 02:17:10.000]  President Kennedy has been shot.
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.000]  This is a different kind of war.
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:18.000]  The USS Liberty had just been attacked by Israeli jets and torpedo boats.
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:22.000]  The CIA could manipulate the news in the United States.
[02:17:22.000 --> 02:17:26.000]  They took the babies out of incubators and let the children to die on a cold spot.
[02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:30.000]  It was almost as if there were a plan in full if your tank hit them.
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:32.000]  We need to go into the capital.
[02:17:32.000 --> 02:17:35.000]  You will always have conspiracy theories.
[02:17:35.000 --> 02:17:37.000]  They are nothing but distract.
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:40.000]  You guys censored Harvard-educated doctors.
[02:17:40.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  You silenced those voices.
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:46.000]  What we want to do in Davos is push the reset button.
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:52.000]  As soon as we start exposing the great preset, the sooner these globalists start going to prison.
[02:17:52.000 --> 02:17:57.000]  I'm not talking to the viewers and listeners that have gone to InfoWars.com
[02:17:57.000 --> 02:18:02.000]  and gotten the great products that enrich your life, that empower your immune system and your body,
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000]  and keep us on air.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:09.000]  I am humbly, pat in hand, talking to the viewers and listeners that have tuned in many of you for years
[02:18:09.000 --> 02:18:11.000]  and never gone to InfoWars.com.
[02:18:11.000 --> 02:18:15.000]  We know the vast, vast, vast, vast majority of you
[02:18:15.000 --> 02:18:22.000]  never actually go to InfoWars.com and never experienced these great products and never found the operation.
[02:18:22.000 --> 02:18:25.000]  Sure, you share a link, you share an article, you tell folks about the show.
[02:18:25.000 --> 02:18:27.000]  That's great, and I thank you.
[02:18:27.000 --> 02:18:29.000]  But we need funds to operate.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:33.000]  Plus, we've got really great products that do amazing things for people like our CBD oil
[02:18:33.000 --> 02:18:37.000]  and our fizzy magnesium and our sleep bait and our nitric oxide and our real Red Pill Plus.
[02:18:37.000 --> 02:18:39.000]  All of these are really great products.
[02:18:39.000 --> 02:18:40.000]  They keep us on air.
[02:18:40.000 --> 02:18:45.000]  Plus, you're missing out on having these products, so get off the bench, get in the game, step to the plate,
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:19:11.000]  and go to InfoWars.com right now and get these great InfoWars products at InfoWars.com.
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:16.000]  That's why I ask listeners, respectively, to go to InfoWars.com and buy great products
[02:19:16.000 --> 02:19:22.000]  that will enrich and empower your life while keeping us on air at the very same time.

[02:19:28.000 --> 02:19:34.000]  Ultimate Bone Broth, Back at Stock, Nitric Boost, the amazing CBD oil we have
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:38.000]  that's the highest quality you're going to find anywhere at more than half off.
[02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:42.000]  It's available at InfoWars.com, some of the very best products.
[02:19:42.000 --> 02:19:44.000]  And a lot of you have never shopped at InfoWars.com.
[02:19:44.000 --> 02:19:46.000]  You've been watching for years, you've been listening for years,
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:49.000]  but you've never taken the step to go to InfoWars.com.
[02:19:49.000 --> 02:19:52.000]  These are great products that really work and are amazing.
[02:19:52.000 --> 02:19:53.000]  Plus, they keep us on air.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:57.000]  So again, please take action and go to InfoWars.com today.
[02:19:57.000 --> 02:20:09.000]  Thank you.
[02:20:27.000 --> 02:20:36.000]  All right, folks.
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:37.000]  We're going to take some more phone calls.
[02:20:37.000 --> 02:20:38.000]  Barnes is going to leave us in 10 minutes.
[02:20:38.000 --> 02:20:40.000]  I'll continue with all the other callers that are on hold.
[02:20:40.000 --> 02:20:42.000]  We'll get to every single one of you before this hour ends.
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.000]  We're about to go to Sean and others.
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:48.000]  But I was scheduled to go to Dallas tomorrow night
[02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:52.000]  and co-host with Crowder on his official kickoff of his new show.
[02:20:52.000 --> 02:20:55.000]  But he called me this weekend and said,
[02:20:55.000 --> 02:20:57.000]  we're going to launch a day early.
[02:20:57.000 --> 02:20:59.000]  We're going to launch tomorrow on Tuesday.
[02:20:59.000 --> 02:21:01.000]  And we'd like you to co-host the first two shows.
[02:21:01.000 --> 02:21:02.000]  You can host your show from there.
[02:21:02.000 --> 02:21:04.000]  And he goes, I come on right after he does.
[02:21:04.000 --> 02:21:06.000]  He goes off at 11 a.m.
[02:21:06.000 --> 02:21:08.000]  I go live at 11 a.m.
[02:21:08.000 --> 02:21:10.000]  So I'm going to be hosting the whole show tomorrow
[02:21:10.000 --> 02:21:12.000]  and Wednesday with Crowder.
[02:21:12.000 --> 02:21:13.000]  He's done a lot for the show.
[02:21:13.000 --> 02:21:16.000]  So I want to go up and support him in doing that.
[02:21:16.000 --> 02:21:18.000]  And he also has said we're the biggest draw to his show.
[02:21:18.000 --> 02:21:20.000]  So we're happy to work with him on that.
[02:21:20.000 --> 02:21:22.000]  But just in case I need to break,
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:24.000]  because I'll be on 8.30 in the morning,
[02:21:24.000 --> 02:21:26.000]  commercial free until 11,
[02:21:26.000 --> 02:21:28.000]  I'll be a little cross-eyed after that.
[02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:29.000]  And Barnes is a heavy hitter.
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:32.000]  He's going to be hosting Wednesday, the first hour.
[02:21:32.000 --> 02:21:35.000]  And then I will come in after that.
[02:21:35.000 --> 02:21:37.000]  Barnes, you had one more point you were making
[02:21:37.000 --> 02:21:38.000]  during the break.
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:40.000]  And I said, please make that about Trump.
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:43.000]  Before we go to calls, you're tying it into David Letterman.
[02:21:43.000 --> 02:21:44.000]  Yeah, no doubt.
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:45.000]  I mean, this has happened before in New York,
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:48.000]  where someone has been the victim of extortion.
[02:21:48.000 --> 02:21:50.000]  David Letterman had illicit relationships
[02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:52.000]  with a bunch of his staff.
[02:21:52.000 --> 02:21:54.000]  And somebody extorted him.
[02:21:54.000 --> 02:21:56.000]  He ultimately went public about it
[02:21:56.000 --> 02:21:58.000]  but paid hush money during the process.
[02:21:58.000 --> 02:22:01.000]  They didn't accuse him of a crime by paying hush money.
[02:22:01.000 --> 02:22:04.000]  Instead, they accused the people trying to extort him
[02:22:04.000 --> 02:22:06.000]  of committing the crime.
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.000]  And it's important to note in this context,
[02:22:08.000 --> 02:22:10.000]  this is who her lawyer has been
[02:22:10.000 --> 02:22:12.000]  throughout large parts of this process.
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:15.000]  Michael Avenatti, what is he in federal prison for?
[02:22:15.000 --> 02:22:16.000]  Extortion.
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:19.000]  So when he tried to do this to Nike in New York,
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:21.000]  they prosecuted Avenatti.
[02:22:21.000 --> 02:22:23.000]  Why haven't they prosecuted Stormy Daniels' lawyers
[02:22:23.000 --> 02:22:25.000]  that were part of this extortion scheme
[02:22:25.000 --> 02:22:27.000]  rather than prosecute Trump?
[02:22:27.000 --> 02:22:30.000]  That's what shows what an embarrassment this whole prosecution is.
[02:22:30.000 --> 02:22:32.000]  Trump did nothing wrong, wasn't a crime,
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:34.000]  wasn't a campaign finance violation,
[02:22:34.000 --> 02:22:37.000]  didn't meet state criminal standards anyway,
[02:22:37.000 --> 02:22:40.000]  but the criminal were the people on behalf of Stormy Daniels
[02:22:40.000 --> 02:22:42.000]  extorting Trump, not Trump.
[02:22:42.000 --> 02:22:43.000]  Incredible.
[02:22:43.000 --> 02:22:44.000]  Let's talk to Sean in New Jersey.
[02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:45.000]  Thanks for holding Sean.
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:47.000]  You're on the air.
[02:22:47.000 --> 02:22:49.000]  How's it going today, my brothers?
[02:22:49.000 --> 02:22:51.000]  Christ, how are we on this blessed day?
[02:22:51.000 --> 02:22:54.000]  Man, we're fighting hard for the future of humanity.
[02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:56.000]  Amen.
[02:22:56.000 --> 02:23:00.000]  So my question is for Mr. Barnes.
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:02.000]  Under the First Amendment,
[02:23:02.000 --> 02:23:04.000]  we're permitted our right
[02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:08.000]  to address the government for grievances.
[02:23:08.000 --> 02:23:10.000]  So, hi, sweetheart.
[02:23:10.000 --> 02:23:12.000]  My daughter came out to see me.
[02:23:12.000 --> 02:23:13.000]  It's okay, go ahead, though.
[02:23:13.000 --> 02:23:16.000]  Isn't there a way
[02:23:16.000 --> 02:23:19.000]  that we can sign a petition
[02:23:19.000 --> 02:23:21.000]  with, at a minimum,
[02:23:21.000 --> 02:23:23.000]  60% of the population
[02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:27.000]  and do so with, like, legitimately,
[02:23:27.000 --> 02:23:31.000]  two proofs of ID having it notarized
[02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:34.000]  because they don't seem to listen
[02:23:34.000 --> 02:23:36.000]  to what we have to say.
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:38.000]  So if we do a petition
[02:23:38.000 --> 02:23:40.000]  with more than 60% of the population
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:42.000]  and done so legally,
[02:23:42.000 --> 02:23:45.000]  two forms of ID notarized
[02:23:45.000 --> 02:23:50.000]  to recall these traders.
[02:23:50.000 --> 02:23:51.000]  Yeah, let's talk about that.
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:53.000]  We see a lot of recalls at the state level
[02:23:53.000 --> 02:23:55.000]  that have been effective, like,
[02:23:55.000 --> 02:23:56.000]  like Governor Davis in California.
[02:23:56.000 --> 02:23:58.000]  What about federal recalls with the petition?
[02:23:58.000 --> 02:24:00.000]  Because it's in the First Amendment
[02:24:00.000 --> 02:24:01.000]  that we should petition,
[02:24:01.000 --> 02:24:03.000]  but we don't see a lot of that, Barnes.
[02:24:03.000 --> 02:24:05.000]  Yeah, there's not enough of it.
[02:24:05.000 --> 02:24:08.000]  So you're at the audience, the speaker,
[02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:10.000]  the telephone caller is absolutely correct.
[02:24:10.000 --> 02:24:13.000]  The right to petition for redress of grievances
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:15.000]  is completely constitutionally protected.
[02:24:15.000 --> 02:24:17.000]  It goes all the way back to the principal
[02:24:17.000 --> 02:24:19.000]  at Martin Luther at Wittenberg.
[02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:20.000]  Now his daughter might have heard
[02:24:20.000 --> 02:24:21.000]  petition for redress of grievances
[02:24:21.000 --> 02:24:23.000]  and had her own petition.
[02:24:23.000 --> 02:24:26.000]  But the nature of it, absolutely filing petitions
[02:24:26.000 --> 02:24:27.000]  is absolutely a great idea.
[02:24:27.000 --> 02:24:29.000]  I always support petitions,
[02:24:29.000 --> 02:24:31.000]  whether it's online or in person
[02:24:31.000 --> 02:24:33.000]  or physically, however it's done.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.000]  It's much more effective than people realize
[02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.000]  or people recognize.
[02:24:37.000 --> 02:24:39.000]  So the petitioning for, I mean,
[02:24:39.000 --> 02:24:41.000]  calling into your congressman, your state legislator,
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:44.000]  all these things make more impact than people expect
[02:24:44.000 --> 02:24:46.000]  because it's so rarely happened.
[02:24:46.000 --> 02:24:48.000]  They rarely get major petitions.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:50.000]  They rarely get tons of calls in congress.
[02:24:50.000 --> 02:24:52.000]  They don't get any, but the local...
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:53.000]  That's right.
[02:24:53.000 --> 02:24:55.000]  And a lot of us are politically active.
[02:24:55.000 --> 02:24:56.000]  Some are beating up the audience,
[02:24:56.000 --> 02:24:57.000]  but the general public, they've been asleep.
[02:24:57.000 --> 02:24:59.000]  So really, in the day, it's our fault
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:01.000]  that this is basically unfolded.
[02:25:01.000 --> 02:25:03.000]  It's like in FIFA Vendetta.
[02:25:03.000 --> 02:25:05.000]  He said, you know, we're all the blame here.
[02:25:05.000 --> 02:25:06.000]  There are those that are more guilty
[02:25:06.000 --> 02:25:07.000]  and they will be all accountable.
[02:25:07.000 --> 02:25:09.000]  But if you want to know who really did it,
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:10.000]  you only need look in the mirror.
[02:25:10.000 --> 02:25:12.000]  Andrew at New York on the Trump indictment.
[02:25:12.000 --> 02:25:14.000]  What's your view?
[02:25:14.000 --> 02:25:17.000]  Stormy, Avenatti, Cohn, they all prove it in court
[02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:20.000]  to be lying about this.
[02:25:20.000 --> 02:25:24.000]  I mean, Milani is a lot better looking than Stormy anyways.
[02:25:24.000 --> 02:25:26.000]  And I mean, it's obviously lawfare.
[02:25:26.000 --> 02:25:28.000]  Like you guys obviously know about how ridiculous
[02:25:28.000 --> 02:25:32.000]  I'm saying the lawfare has got him.
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:33.000]  No, I agree.
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:37.000]  So what do you think is going to happen tomorrow?
[02:25:37.000 --> 02:25:41.000]  Well, I think that there's been some infighting
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:44.000]  within the Southern District of New York.
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:46.000]  So I'm not sure if they're going to indict him or not,
[02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:48.000]  but it's definitely not going to go anywhere
[02:25:48.000 --> 02:25:54.000]  because the higher courts would definitely reverse it.
[02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:56.000]  Well, you have the Southern District that's federal
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:25:57.000]  and it's declined.
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:26:00.000]  And then you have this Soros DA,
[02:26:00.000 --> 02:26:01.000]  who I don't think is being set up,
[02:26:01.000 --> 02:26:03.000]  doesn't know he's being set up for a fall.
[02:26:03.000 --> 02:26:05.000]  I mean, no one else will do this,
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:06.000]  but he's been chosen to do it.
[02:26:06.000 --> 02:26:07.000]  I appreciate your call.
[02:26:07.000 --> 02:26:10.000]  Barnes, I mean, I kind of see they're making this
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:12.000]  idiot DA walk the plank.
[02:26:12.000 --> 02:26:15.000]  Well, not only that, these people believe two things.
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.000]  One, if he's loyal to Soros in the deep state,
[02:26:18.000 --> 02:26:21.000]  he knows he's going to get rewarded no matter what over time.
[02:26:21.000 --> 02:26:24.000]  So it's like, you know, why is the German Foreign Minister
[02:26:24.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  saying she doesn't care what the German public thinks
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:29.000]  and how much economic pain they go through?
[02:26:29.000 --> 02:26:31.000]  She's going to go through with Brussels'
[02:26:31.000 --> 02:26:33.000]  Agenda of Economic War against Russia regardless.
[02:26:33.000 --> 02:26:35.000]  And by the way, she said it like that.
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.000]  Why would you make an arrogant supervillain comment
[02:26:38.000 --> 02:26:41.000]  like that in public, even if you were a bad person?
[02:26:41.000 --> 02:26:44.000]  Again, why do they love to rub it in, Barnes?
[02:26:44.000 --> 02:26:46.000]  Because she's auditioning for future work
[02:26:46.000 --> 02:26:48.000]  in the globalist empire.
[02:26:48.000 --> 02:26:50.000]  She knows that even if she's no longer an elected official,
[02:26:50.000 --> 02:26:53.000]  she's guaranteed a future career path
[02:26:53.000 --> 02:26:56.000]  with the European Union, with the United Nations,
[02:26:56.000 --> 02:26:59.000]  with the George Soros Open Society Foundation,
[02:26:59.000 --> 02:27:02.000]  with either Carnegie or Rockefeller Gates Foundation.
[02:27:02.000 --> 02:27:05.000]  She knows she has an income guaranteed for life.
[02:27:05.000 --> 02:27:08.000]  And that's the same reason, like, why is Macron,
[02:27:08.000 --> 02:27:11.000]  blowing, he's at like 15% approval,
[02:27:11.000 --> 02:27:14.000]  suddenly decides to cut the equivalent of French Social Security,
[02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:17.000]  does so without French Parliament approval,
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:20.000]  knowing that it's going to lead to him likely being ousted in a few months.
[02:27:20.000 --> 02:27:24.000]  Because he's proving his loyalty to the globalist bankers.
[02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:25.000]  That's right.
[02:27:25.000 --> 02:27:28.000]  Again, remember, this is a guy who is literally a Rothschild banker.
[02:27:28.000 --> 02:27:30.000]  That's where he came from.
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:32.000]  And let's go further and back you up.
[02:27:32.000 --> 02:27:35.000]  The minister in the Netherlands over farming,
[02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:37.000]  who said we're going to shut down a third of the farms this year,
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:40.000]  90% by 2030 for the earth,
[02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:42.000]  is totally unpopular, gets removed,
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:46.000]  and then made the head of the UN program worldwide over farming.
[02:27:46.000 --> 02:27:49.000]  So people always criticize Israel, and I don't hate Israel,
[02:27:49.000 --> 02:27:52.000]  but I do not like the fact that Israelis come here and commit crimes,
[02:27:52.000 --> 02:27:54.000]  dual citizens run back there.
[02:27:54.000 --> 02:27:56.000]  Well, if you're worried about people running back to Israel,
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:59.000]  what about people worldwide running to the UN?
[02:27:59.000 --> 02:28:02.000]  The IMF, the World Bank, because that's really the real power.
[02:28:02.000 --> 02:28:04.000]  They commit all these crimes, rape us,
[02:28:04.000 --> 02:28:09.000]  and then they get teleported up a diplomatic community to this whole system.
[02:28:09.000 --> 02:28:10.000]  Exactly.
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:12.000]  And then usually there's extortion and blackmail on these people.
[02:28:12.000 --> 02:28:14.000]  Like the prosecutor at the International Criminal Court
[02:28:14.000 --> 02:28:17.000]  bringing the bogus arrest warrant against Putin.
[02:28:17.000 --> 02:28:22.000]  His brother is a convicted pedophile connected to pedophilia rings.
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:25.000]  So they also often have blackmail on all these people too.
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:30.000]  By the way, I actually hit your Skype button and cut you off for a minute.
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:32.000]  I know you got to go Barnes, but do five more minutes,
[02:28:32.000 --> 02:28:35.000]  because I want to talk about the Putin indicted by the UN,
[02:28:35.000 --> 02:28:38.000]  and I almost forgot I wanted to cover this when you first came on.
[02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:40.000]  Big developments in the Jeffrey Epstein case.
[02:28:40.000 --> 02:28:41.000]  So thank you.
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:43.000]  We'll come right back with what you were just saying,
[02:28:43.000 --> 02:28:45.000]  and then I'm over here cutting off what you said on accident,
[02:28:45.000 --> 02:28:47.000]  and people are like, they're cutting the audio.
[02:28:47.000 --> 02:28:50.000]  Yeah, it's my fat fingers over here hitting the wrong button.
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:52.000]  Okay, Robert Barnes, stay right there.
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:54.000]  We'll come right back and talk about this,
[02:28:54.000 --> 02:28:56.000]  and then we'll come back to all the calls.
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:58.000]  Michael, Tim, Spring, Mike, Kenny, Marcus.
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:02.000]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:29:06.000 --> 02:29:08.000]  I want you all to know something.
[02:29:08.000 --> 02:29:10.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:29:10.000 --> 02:29:13.000]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:16.000]  Alex has been right on court over a decade.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:20.000]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:29:20.000 --> 02:29:22.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:29:22.000 --> 02:29:24.000]  Think about how frustrated we are
[02:29:24.000 --> 02:29:26.000]  if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:28.000]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones,
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:30.000]  or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:29:30.000 --> 02:29:33.000]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[02:29:33.000 --> 02:29:37.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:29:37.000 --> 02:29:40.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:29:40.000 --> 02:29:43.000]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:29:43.000 --> 02:29:46.000]  The government deers Alex Jones.
[02:29:46.000 --> 02:29:48.000]  That's why the globalists hate me,
[02:29:48.000 --> 02:29:52.000]  because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:30:19.000 --> 02:30:22.000]  Think of what we've done with just one percent
[02:30:22.000 --> 02:30:25.000]  of our massive audience actually buying products.
[02:30:25.000 --> 02:30:28.000]  Think what would happen if those of you on the fence
[02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000]  actually went to infowarstore.com
[02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000]  and got some of these amazing products.
[02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:35.000]  I would recommend Tomb Raek 95 for your joints,
[02:30:35.000 --> 02:30:38.000]  your bones, inflammation to get one of the biggest effects
[02:30:38.000 --> 02:30:40.000]  so you reorder and see how great it is.
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:43.000]  Also, we've got the super high quality,
[02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:45.000]  full spectrum CBD oil that's so good
[02:30:45.000 --> 02:30:48.000]  if you're in neurological systems, your brain,
[02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:50.000]  your joints, your bones as well.
[02:30:50.000 --> 02:30:51.000]  Or real Red Bull Plus.
[02:30:51.000 --> 02:30:53.000]  Just go try the product,
[02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000]  fund the info war and help us defeat the ruler together.
[02:30:55.000 --> 02:30:58.000]  infowarstore.com
[02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.000]  I'm a huge believer in information.
[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:02.000]  I watch info wars every day
[02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:04.000]  and follow Alex Jones closely.
[02:31:04.000 --> 02:31:06.000]  You know why? He can push ahead of the curve.
[02:31:06.000 --> 02:31:09.000]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:31:09.000 --> 02:31:11.000]  Think about how frustrated we are
[02:31:11.000 --> 02:31:13.000]  if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:31:13.000 --> 02:31:15.000]  You can be in like an Alex Jones
[02:31:15.000 --> 02:31:17.000]  or those guys have been awake for like decades.
[02:31:17.000 --> 02:31:21.000]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:31:21.000 --> 02:31:23.000]  This is reality.
[02:31:23.000 --> 02:31:25.000]  It just can't get through.
[02:31:25.000 --> 02:31:27.000]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.000]  The revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:32.000]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[02:31:32.000 --> 02:31:34.000]  You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[02:31:34.000 --> 02:31:37.000]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[02:31:37.000 --> 02:31:40.000]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[02:31:40.000 --> 02:31:44.000]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country.
[02:31:44.000 --> 02:31:46.000]  Bigger than any of the networks.
[02:31:46.000 --> 02:31:48.000]  The biggest megaphone in the country.
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:50.000]  We're going to get fired up about the real thing.
[02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:52.000]  The things that matter.
[02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:58.000]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[02:31:59.000 --> 02:32:02.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes info wars has had.
[02:32:02.000 --> 02:32:04.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:32:04.000 --> 02:32:08.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:10.000]  When we talk about the crew at info wars,
[02:32:10.000 --> 02:32:13.000]  people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:32:13.000 --> 02:32:17.000]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:32:17.000 --> 02:32:20.000]  And we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schreuer and the hard work
[02:32:20.000 --> 02:32:22.000]  they engage in every day.
[02:32:22.000 --> 02:32:24.000]  Five, six, seven days a week.
[02:32:24.000 --> 02:32:26.000]  It's really just incredible.
[02:32:26.000 --> 02:32:28.000]  So for myself and the whole info wars crew,
[02:32:28.000 --> 02:32:30.000]  I thank you for your past support.
[02:32:30.000 --> 02:32:33.000]  I want to encourage you now to realize that info wars
[02:32:33.000 --> 02:32:35.000]  cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:32:35.000 --> 02:32:37.000]  I know you spread the word.
[02:32:37.000 --> 02:32:39.000]  I know you pray for us and that's wonderful.
[02:32:39.000 --> 02:32:40.000]  Keep doing it.
[02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:43.000]  But most viewers and listeners never go to infowarstore.com
[02:32:43.000 --> 02:32:46.000]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life.
[02:32:46.000 --> 02:32:48.000]  All at the same time, keep us on air.
[02:32:48.000 --> 02:32:50.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners
[02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:52.000]  actually go buy products at infowarstore.com.
[02:32:52.000 --> 02:32:55.000]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to infowarstore.com,
[02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:57.000]  our fighting problems will be over.
[02:32:57.000 --> 02:33:08.000]  Please take action now.
[02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:31.000]  Well, I always like doing my broadcasts,
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:33.000]  but I really love it.
[02:33:33.000 --> 02:33:36.000]  And Robert Barnes is on with us.
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:38.000]  He'll leave us here in a few minutes.
[02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000]  There's so much breaking news.
[02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:41.000]  A lot of it good.
[02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000]  We're going to be hitting here,
[02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:45.000]  but he got cut off by the break
[02:33:45.000 --> 02:33:49.000]  talking about the UN prosecutor that's gone after Putin.
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:54.000]  Even John Bolton has come out and said this isn't good of all people.
[02:33:54.000 --> 02:33:58.000]  Is the UN going to have the power to arrest whoever they want?
[02:33:58.000 --> 02:34:01.000]  Or they don't even have due process?
[02:34:01.000 --> 02:34:05.000]  So you were getting into the prosecutor having a skeletons in his closet, Robert.
[02:34:05.000 --> 02:34:07.000]  Yeah, with a lot of these,
[02:34:07.000 --> 02:34:10.000]  when people try to understand why does somebody like the Soros DA
[02:34:10.000 --> 02:34:13.000]  do something that could backfire on them politically?
[02:34:13.000 --> 02:34:15.000]  Why do some people commit political suicide?
[02:34:15.000 --> 02:34:17.000]  Why do they elevate the interest of globalists
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:19.000]  and explicitly say they're doing so
[02:34:19.000 --> 02:34:21.000]  at the expense of their own domestic political careers?
[02:34:21.000 --> 02:34:25.000]  Whether it's Macron in France, Boris Johnson in the UK,
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:28.000]  or that German finance minister,
[02:34:28.000 --> 02:34:30.000]  or several other governments that have collapsed,
[02:34:30.000 --> 02:34:32.000]  including the Italian prime minister and a half dozen others,
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:35.000]  in the European nation since the launch of the economic war
[02:34:35.000 --> 02:34:38.000]  of the globalist war against Russia has failed.
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:40.000]  It's because often they have a compromise on them.
[02:34:40.000 --> 02:34:42.000]  Again, it's an example of confession through projection.
[02:34:42.000 --> 02:34:45.000]  Look at what they're accusing Trump of is what they're guilty of.
[02:34:45.000 --> 02:34:47.000]  They're literally political kamikazis
[02:34:47.000 --> 02:34:50.000]  because they were put in there as globalist agents to carry out a mission.
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:53.000]  There was never a debate on whether they were going to betray them.
[02:34:53.000 --> 02:34:56.000]  Nothing but the stain for the constituency.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:57.000]  Exactly.
[02:34:57.000 --> 02:35:00.000]  And they often have complicity,
[02:35:00.000 --> 02:35:04.000]  and there's usually a Hoover-style blackmail file on these people.
[02:35:04.000 --> 02:35:06.000]  So the prosecutor that-
[02:35:06.000 --> 02:35:07.000]  Well, take Macron.
[02:35:07.000 --> 02:35:11.000]  He was a 14-year-old, as you said, sex operative.
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:12.000]  Exactly.
[02:35:12.000 --> 02:35:14.000]  And so the prosecutor who's led the effort
[02:35:14.000 --> 02:35:16.000]  at the International Criminal Court,
[02:35:16.000 --> 02:35:18.000]  which the United States is not part of,
[02:35:18.000 --> 02:35:20.000]  China is not part of, Russia has now rejected,
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:24.000]  but so its legal authority is non-existent
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:26.000]  because it becomes so politically weaponized.
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:29.000]  But who is this prosecutor that's bringing this case against Putin?
[02:35:29.000 --> 02:35:32.000]  He's someone who has family ties to a pedophile ring.
[02:35:32.000 --> 02:35:37.000]  So it's not a coincidence that there's a reason why Jeffrey Epstein existed.
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:41.000]  There's a reason why his list, his real client list, not his phone list,
[02:35:41.000 --> 02:35:43.000]  is still secret and hidden.
[02:35:43.000 --> 02:35:46.000]  It's because of what's being exposed in the U.S. Virgin Islands lawsuit
[02:35:46.000 --> 02:35:50.000]  against Chase Bank, which was a high-ranking Chase Bankers are implicated.
[02:35:50.000 --> 02:35:52.000]  The Mossad is implicated.
[02:35:52.000 --> 02:35:54.000]  MI6 is implicated.
[02:35:54.000 --> 02:35:56.000]  It goes back to why Ghislaine Maxwell,
[02:35:56.000 --> 02:35:58.000]  Ghislaine Maxwell's father's Robert Maxwell.
[02:35:58.000 --> 02:36:01.000]  Robert Maxwell was an intel operative connected to the KGB,
[02:36:01.000 --> 02:36:04.000]  the Mossad, the Stasi and the MI6,
[02:36:04.000 --> 02:36:07.000]  and he mysteriously fell off a boat
[02:36:07.000 --> 02:36:09.000]  when they thought his skinels would blow up.
[02:36:09.000 --> 02:36:11.000]  So it relates back to what is Epstein.
[02:36:11.000 --> 02:36:13.000]  Epstein is part of this broader operation
[02:36:13.000 --> 02:36:15.000]  that they have compromised on all these people.
[02:36:15.000 --> 02:36:18.000]  The one person they didn't have a compromise on is Donald Trump.
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:20.000]  That's why they have made up cases against him.
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:23.000]  But a lot of these other people, they've compromised.
[02:36:23.000 --> 02:36:27.000]  Well, that was my point about the lawsuit in the Virgin Islands.
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:29.000]  Here it is right here.
[02:36:29.000 --> 02:36:37.000]  JPMorgan Chase, CNBC, can be sued by Virgin Islands over Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking claims.
[02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:41.000]  That just broke today.
[02:36:41.000 --> 02:36:46.000]  Also, we have another federal judge saying that
[02:36:46.000 --> 02:36:49.000]  these lawsuits on people that confirm by the Twitter files
[02:36:49.000 --> 02:36:53.000]  that they were censored by Biden can go forward.
[02:36:53.000 --> 02:36:57.000]  Biden White House accused of silencing opposition views on opposition enterprise.
[02:36:57.000 --> 02:36:59.000]  Now the judge just ruled that can go forward.
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:01.000]  Let's talk about the JPMorgan situation.
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:03.000]  That's big.
[02:37:03.000 --> 02:37:06.000]  Oh, completely. I mean, JPMorgan was neck deep in this.
[02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:09.000]  The other reason they want to centralize banking controls
[02:37:09.000 --> 02:37:13.000]  is that they want to have centralized control over money laundering.
[02:37:13.000 --> 02:37:16.000]  That all of these banks, I mean, you have Credit Suisse went under.
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.000]  And who got them? UBS.
[02:37:18.000 --> 02:37:22.000]  Who's the biggest global money launderer in the last 25 years? UBS.
[02:37:22.000 --> 02:37:23.000]  And the UBS scores not alone.
[02:37:23.000 --> 02:37:25.000]  HSBC was one of the big ones.
[02:37:25.000 --> 02:37:28.000]  We remember the stories that broke about BCCI,
[02:37:28.000 --> 02:37:30.000]  which showed this is how the model operates.
[02:37:30.000 --> 02:37:32.000]  This is the template. This is the pattern.
[02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:38.000]  Well, JPMorgan Chase properly named for the guy who helped found the Fed at Jekyll Island
[02:37:38.000 --> 02:37:42.000]  in the early 1900s with the formation and the planning of it.
[02:37:42.000 --> 02:37:48.000]  John Piermont Morgan himself being the lead orchestrator and organizer of it.
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:53.000]  Well, they were the main bank facilitating all the activities of Epstein,
[02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:54.000]  but what beyond that?
[02:37:54.000 --> 02:37:58.000]  The texts and emails show the high ranking bank executives
[02:37:58.000 --> 02:38:01.000]  making Snow White type jokes.
[02:38:01.000 --> 02:38:04.000]  And you don't have to be a genius to know what that's in reference to.
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:08.000]  So this was knowing complicity and culpability.
[02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:09.000]  And here you have to wonder,
[02:38:09.000 --> 02:38:14.000]  what were some of the compromised lawyers doing that were supposedly representing Epstein victims?
[02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:17.000]  People like David Bowies, other people.
[02:38:17.000 --> 02:38:19.000]  Why didn't they ever sue?
[02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:22.000]  Not only did they never sue Clinton, never sue Gore,
[02:38:22.000 --> 02:38:25.000]  even though they were ties to both of them in Epstein,
[02:38:25.000 --> 02:38:28.000]  never sued George Stephanopoulos or anybody else tied to Epstein,
[02:38:28.000 --> 02:38:29.000]  never sued Bill Gates.
[02:38:29.000 --> 02:38:30.000]  No, he was tied to Epstein.
[02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:34.000]  Instead, they tried to take out Dershowitz based on what we now know
[02:38:34.000 --> 02:38:36.000]  were bogus claims against Dershowitz.
[02:38:36.000 --> 02:38:39.000]  But why did they never try to take out J.P. Morgan Chase?
[02:38:39.000 --> 02:38:41.000]  Why did they never sue him?
[02:38:41.000 --> 02:38:44.000]  Because they know going out for somebody who was innocent like Dershowitz,
[02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:48.000]  and he was, folks, would be a dead end.
[02:38:48.000 --> 02:38:49.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:38:49.000 --> 02:38:53.000]  I mean, their goal was use the Epstein case to defame Dershowitz
[02:38:53.000 --> 02:38:58.000]  while protecting the real criminals and culprits behind the Epstein Empire.
[02:38:58.000 --> 02:39:00.000]  That's what the Southern District of New York was about.
[02:39:00.000 --> 02:39:05.000]  It was about containing the Epstein case and died him.
[02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  He suicides himself.
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:11.000]  He Clintons himself, like that recent person somehow did on a plane.
[02:39:11.000 --> 02:39:13.000]  I mean, how does somebody, I mean, it's amazing.
[02:39:13.000 --> 02:39:16.000]  The Clinton death curse has got to be the worst death curse in the history of years.
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:20.000]  You know, I saw Clinton official top lawyer dies in plane.
[02:39:20.000 --> 02:39:21.000]  I thought it was a crash.
[02:39:21.000 --> 02:39:22.000]  Then I read, everybody else is fine.
[02:39:22.000 --> 02:39:23.000]  She broke her neck.
[02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:24.000]  She's dead on the plane.
[02:39:24.000 --> 02:39:27.000]  I was thinking of Ron Brown, the Treasury Secretary or the Commerce Secretary.
[02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:34.000]  So in closing here, pulling back the weaponization hearings, destroying them,
[02:39:34.000 --> 02:39:38.000]  all their criminality, Redfield coming out two weeks ago saying,
[02:39:38.000 --> 02:39:39.000]  Fauci lied.
[02:39:39.000 --> 02:39:41.000]  I knew it was manmade.
[02:39:41.000 --> 02:39:43.000]  We released the worst plague ever.
[02:39:43.000 --> 02:39:46.000]  On every front, Jan 6, all the truth coming out.
[02:39:46.000 --> 02:39:50.000]  On every front, everything with deep states done is blowing up at their face.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:53.000]  How would you quantify why that's happening?
[02:39:53.000 --> 02:39:58.000]  So, I mean, it's critical there's continued to be pushback on behalf of the populist side
[02:39:58.000 --> 02:39:59.000]  of the equation.
[02:39:59.000 --> 02:40:03.000]  J.D. Vance has done some great work on this, pushing back against what's happening in
[02:40:03.000 --> 02:40:07.000]  East Palestine, Ohio, pushing back against the Iraq war recently, reminding everybody
[02:40:07.000 --> 02:40:09.000]  what a disaster and debacle that was.
[02:40:09.000 --> 02:40:14.000]  So that the populist voice continues to be heard because places like InfoWars exist
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:17.000]  and the InfoWars audience exist and the InfoWars audience won't go away,
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:20.000]  no matter how much lawfare is waged against them.
[02:40:20.000 --> 02:40:24.000]  That's part of the reason why the people should not underestimate their ordinary voice,
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:27.000]  their Paul Revere effect on the American court of public opinion.
[02:40:27.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  It keeps showing up and keeps pushing back and keeps resisting these globalist agendas
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:36.000]  and globalist plans that continue to fall apart and fail when they're exposed to the
[02:40:36.000 --> 02:40:38.000]  public scrutiny and public truth.
[02:40:38.000 --> 02:40:41.000]  And I'll tell you this in closing and you got to go or come back and take calls.
[02:40:41.000 --> 02:40:42.000]  You got to leave.
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:44.000]  And this isn't me kissing your ass.
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:45.000]  It's celebrating success.
[02:40:45.000 --> 02:40:50.000]  I've been around, I knew who you were, you know, way back 20 years ago with the whole
[02:40:50.000 --> 02:40:53.000]  Leslie Snipes case and, you know, we would have you on for many years.
[02:40:53.000 --> 02:40:54.000]  You've always been popular.
[02:40:54.000 --> 02:41:00.000]  If I look at you and Viva Fry, your co-host, he's being retweeted daily by Elon Musk.
[02:41:00.000 --> 02:41:04.000]  You guys are now not reaching hundreds of thousands a day or reaching millions a day.
[02:41:04.000 --> 02:41:05.000]  Your show's exploded.
[02:41:05.000 --> 02:41:12.000]  And it's not like you came along later like, you know, so many other people, which is fine
[02:41:12.000 --> 02:41:18.000]  for me, like the, you know, folks that are out there, like Russell Branton people, which
[02:41:18.000 --> 02:41:19.000]  is great.
[02:41:19.000 --> 02:41:20.000]  We're not mad.
[02:41:20.000 --> 02:41:21.000]  They're adopting the truth now.
[02:41:21.000 --> 02:41:22.000]  We expect that.
[02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:23.000]  We don't territorialize it.
[02:41:23.000 --> 02:41:24.000]  We love it.
[02:41:24.000 --> 02:41:28.000]  But, you know, you've been awake the whole time, but just the manifestation of that victory
[02:41:28.000 --> 02:41:30.000]  is huge and it shows we're winning.
[02:41:30.000 --> 02:41:32.000]  I use the example of listeners every day.
[02:41:32.000 --> 02:41:34.000]  I go out in public all the time.
[02:41:34.000 --> 02:41:36.000]  Zero hate now.
[02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:37.000]  Okay.
[02:41:37.000 --> 02:41:39.000]  I used to get 95% love, but a lot of hate.
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:40.000]  Okay.
[02:41:40.000 --> 02:41:41.000]  No hate.
[02:41:41.000 --> 02:41:42.000]  I don't hate things in myself.
[02:41:42.000 --> 02:41:46.000]  I'll get some hate soon, but no hate for like four or five months.
[02:41:46.000 --> 02:41:48.000]  I mean, no hate, nothing but love.
[02:41:48.000 --> 02:41:51.000]  So it shows that there's a critical awakening.
[02:41:51.000 --> 02:41:52.000]  How do people find your show?
[02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:54.000]  How do people find Robert Barnes?
[02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:56.000]  How do they find Viva Fry?
[02:41:56.000 --> 02:41:57.000]  Sure.
[02:41:57.000 --> 02:42:01.000]  So yeah, people can go to one location that has all the content, including exclusive content,
[02:42:01.000 --> 02:42:05.500]  hush hush videos and alternative theories about what's happened in the past, predicted
[02:42:05.500 --> 02:42:08.000]  what was happening with January 6th, right after January 6th.
[02:42:08.000 --> 02:42:14.000]  You can go to VivaBarnsLaw.locals.com and there you can.
[02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:16.000]  And it's also a great community, great curational tool.
[02:42:16.000 --> 02:42:19.000]  We get 500 posts a day for a bunch of people.
[02:42:19.000 --> 02:42:22.000]  The audience is as much like the N4's audience.
[02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:27.000]  The power of Viva Barnes Law.locals.com is the audience, ordinary people who care about
[02:42:27.000 --> 02:42:31.000]  the country, who are helping to change the country in ways they don't even fully understand
[02:42:31.000 --> 02:42:35.000]  or appreciate yet, but their children and their grandchildren, their great-grandchildren
[02:42:35.000 --> 02:42:37.000]  will be the great recipients and beneficiaries of.
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:41.000]  And that was my point, talking about your success is, listeners are out there.
[02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:42.000]  They're independent.
[02:42:42.000 --> 02:42:46.000]  They're not connected to all this in a massive way, but an individual way.
[02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:50.000]  They need to know we're winning together, but we haven't won the war yet.
[02:42:50.000 --> 02:42:51.000]  We're winning major battles.
[02:42:51.000 --> 02:42:53.000]  Robert Barnes, thank you so much.
[02:42:53.000 --> 02:42:54.000]  Glad to be here.
[02:42:54.000 --> 02:42:56.000]  I'm going to go right back to your calls when we come back.
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:42:58.000]  Stay with us.
[02:42:58.000 --> 02:43:06.000]  The most banned man in America, Alex Jones.
[02:43:06.000 --> 02:43:08.000]  I want you all to know something.
[02:43:08.000 --> 02:43:10.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:13.000]  Alex is right about far more things wrong.
[02:43:13.000 --> 02:43:16.000]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:43:16.000 --> 02:43:20.000]  I don't care how you slice it, dice it, flip it up or rub it down.
[02:43:20.000 --> 02:43:22.000]  Alex Jones was right.
[02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:26.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:43:26.000 --> 02:43:30.000]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:43:30.000 --> 02:43:34.000]  Alex Jones called this years ago, years ago.
[02:43:34.000 --> 02:43:38.000]  Alex Jones never bought the Russia hoax, not for a second.
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:41.000]  You are one of the great thinkers of this.
[02:43:41.000 --> 02:43:43.000]  You are a martyr to the First Amendment.
[02:43:43.000 --> 02:43:46.000]  The government, Dears, Alex Jones.
[02:43:46.000 --> 02:44:04.000]  That's why the globalists hate me is because I'm exposing their corporate worldwide tyranny.
[02:44:04.000 --> 02:44:08.000]  So yeah, you say, why doesn't Biden address the disasters in the United States?
[02:44:08.000 --> 02:44:10.000]  He doesn't care.
[02:44:10.000 --> 02:44:11.000]  That's not his job.
[02:44:11.000 --> 02:44:13.000]  He's not the president of the United States.
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:16.000]  He's a puppet operating for the globalists.
[02:44:16.000 --> 02:44:21.000]  Appetites of the autocrat cannot be appeased.
[02:44:21.000 --> 02:44:23.000]  They must be opposed.
[02:44:23.000 --> 02:44:26.000]  Autocrats only understand one word.
[02:44:26.000 --> 02:44:29.000]  No, no, no.
[02:44:29.000 --> 02:44:30.000]  Exactly.
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.000]  And that's why we say no to your vaccines.
[02:44:33.000 --> 02:44:37.000]  We say no to you shutting down our businesses.
[02:44:37.000 --> 02:44:39.000]  We say no to you taking our firearms.
[02:44:39.000 --> 02:44:42.000]  We say no to you censoring our free speech.
[02:44:42.000 --> 02:44:45.000]  We say no to you selling us out to the World Health Organization.
[02:44:45.000 --> 02:44:48.000]  We say no to you getting us into World War III.
[02:44:48.000 --> 02:44:49.000]  You're right.
[02:44:49.000 --> 02:44:51.000]  We stand against autocrats like you, Joe Biden.
[02:44:51.000 --> 02:44:53.000]  And we say no.
[02:44:53.000 --> 02:44:55.000]  And we say no to your war.
[02:45:00.000 --> 02:45:03.000]  Humanity is in a fight for its very life.
[02:45:03.000 --> 02:45:10.000]  And in full wars for decades has been at the very forefront of the fight for a pro-human future.
[02:45:10.000 --> 02:45:12.000]  We can't stay on air without your help.
[02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:14.000]  And I want to thank you all for your past support.

[02:47:31.000 --> 02:47:32.000]  It was an inside job
[02:47:32.000 --> 02:47:34.000]  It was an inside job
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:35.000]  The way it always is
[02:47:35.000 --> 02:47:38.000]  By the world connected
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:41.000]  Your inventors protest
[02:47:41.000 --> 02:47:44.000]  The melody resets it
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:47.000]  It was an inside job
[02:47:47.000 --> 02:47:50.000]  Like it always is
[02:47:50.000 --> 02:47:51.000]  Alright
[02:47:51.000 --> 02:47:54.000]  Like it always is
[02:47:54.000 --> 02:47:58.000]  Michael in DC, thanks for calling, go ahead, you're on the air.
[02:47:58.000 --> 02:48:01.000]  Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[02:48:01.000 --> 02:48:04.000]  This is Michael Graves, I've been on your program a couple of times.
[02:48:04.000 --> 02:48:10.000]  I was in a DC courtroom this morning testifying the defense of the proud boys of January.
[02:48:10.000 --> 02:48:12.000]  You're the misfit singer.
[02:48:12.000 --> 02:48:13.000]  I am.
[02:48:13.000 --> 02:48:16.000]  Hey buddy, I love you man, how you doing?
[02:48:16.000 --> 02:48:19.000]  I'm good Alex, I'm good.
[02:48:19.000 --> 02:48:23.000]  Listen, I want to tell everybody
[02:48:23.000 --> 02:48:30.000]  These prosecutors and all the things that support them, they don't care about the truth.
[02:48:30.000 --> 02:48:34.000]  Even if they know the truth, they don't care about the truth.
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:40.000]  And they are willing to do anything to get their prosecutions in place.
[02:48:40.000 --> 02:48:44.000]  They don't care if you're a priest, a pastor, they don't care if you're in the military.
[02:48:44.000 --> 02:48:47.000]  They will come for all of us.
[02:48:47.000 --> 02:48:53.000]  The truth is a byproduct of what they're after, they don't care.
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:56.000]  By the way brother, you hadn't been on my show in a while, you've been on the others.
[02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:58.000]  A month ago I said hey, we ought to get him on.
[02:48:58.000 --> 02:49:01.000]  I knew you were following and covering the trial.
[02:49:01.000 --> 02:49:03.000]  We should get you on as a guest this week.
[02:49:03.000 --> 02:49:06.000]  This is talking about what you witnessed.
[02:49:06.000 --> 02:49:08.000]  Alex, anytime, anytime.
[02:49:08.000 --> 02:49:13.000]  So in a nutshell, tell us what you're witnessing and when we put you on hold, we'll set you up as a guest this week.
[02:49:13.000 --> 02:49:15.000]  But go ahead.
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:18.000]  I'm witnessing what everybody else sees.
[02:49:18.000 --> 02:49:32.000]  In the courtroom, the prosecutors are ameliad, weasel-looking jerks that are just attacking everybody.
[02:49:32.000 --> 02:49:36.000]  They're visiting, they're going to see the different defendants.
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:45.000]  I heard about them showing up at defendants' houses and intimidating people.
[02:49:45.000 --> 02:49:52.000]  Oh, I mean the judge said, we got the documents that the feds ran the attack and they had informants that they were not doing anything violent.
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:57.000]  And they gave all the secret files on accident for the first time in modern history that we ever heard of.
[02:49:57.000 --> 02:50:00.000]  A judge said they're allowed to destroy evidence.
[02:50:00.000 --> 02:50:02.000]  I mean that came out two weeks ago.
[02:50:02.000 --> 02:50:09.000]  Everybody that has eyes to see and ears to hear know what the truth is and what's happening.
[02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:16.000]  I think this Trump indictment aside of the legal things that are going on is also a provocation.
[02:50:16.000 --> 02:50:19.000]  They're trying to provoke us into violence.
[02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:29.000]  Or they're trying to provoke us to gather together so that they can instigate and agitate and provoke violence to then prosecute us.
[02:50:29.000 --> 02:50:38.000]  To continue to get us, move people like me, obviously people like you and everybody else off the chess board.
[02:50:38.000 --> 02:50:40.000]  They're trying to intimidate us.
[02:50:40.000 --> 02:50:49.000]  Your first caller, Rob, his solutions were incredible where we can have prayer vigils or these protests where we're being smart.
[02:50:49.000 --> 02:51:08.000]  Paul Joseph Watson had put up on Truth Social a poll and polling people whether they believe that this is another January 6th set up an 85% of the people that responded to that poll said yes.
[02:51:08.000 --> 02:51:13.000]  So we know what they're trying to do and we cannot walk through that door and have it again.
[02:51:13.000 --> 02:51:20.000]  Because it doesn't matter. The judges don't care and the prosecutors don't care.
[02:51:20.000 --> 02:51:24.000]  They're just trying to get us all...
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:28.000]  It's a total criminal commitment.
[02:51:28.000 --> 02:51:33.000]  We see it with you and we see it with Roger Stone and so many others.
[02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:36.000]  The process is the punishment.
[02:51:36.000 --> 02:51:46.000]  So for people like me and Joe Biggs and all these other people that are trying to defend themselves that don't have them in a lot of the cases,
[02:51:46.000 --> 02:52:00.000]  the means to defend themselves, they're rolling the bus over them and trying to intimidate us all into just staying in our houses and quarrying in a quarry.
[02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:06.000]  So you're there covering the trial and you're witnessing all this?
[02:52:06.000 --> 02:52:11.000]  I'm actually on my way home to see my family. I've been out for a couple of weeks now.
[02:52:11.000 --> 02:52:17.000]  My birthday is tomorrow so I'm going to go home and be with my family.
[02:52:17.000 --> 02:52:21.000]  But you're saying you've never even heard of anything like what you're witnessing?
[02:52:21.000 --> 02:52:29.000]  No. I've never experienced anything like this in my life.
[02:52:29.000 --> 02:52:35.000]  What do you make of this so-called Trump judge?
[02:52:35.000 --> 02:52:40.000]  I think that he's obviously part of the problem.
[02:52:40.000 --> 02:52:54.000]  He's part of the problem because he's not allowing evidence that should be put up in the jury that should see and hear this evidence, this exculpatory evidence that they should see it.
[02:52:54.000 --> 02:53:05.000]  And another thing about the jury, Alex, if I was a defendant and I was looking at that jury, I wouldn't have high hopes of having these people judge me.
[02:53:05.000 --> 02:53:08.000]  It's not a jury of their peers.
[02:53:08.000 --> 02:53:12.000]  If they'll rig everything, they'll rig anything.
[02:53:12.000 --> 02:53:16.000]  Anything, they'll rig everything. We know this.
[02:53:16.000 --> 02:53:22.000]  Hey, come on the show soon whenever you want to. I really appreciate you calling in, brother. Great work.
[02:53:22.000 --> 02:53:23.000]  Thanks, Alex.
[02:53:23.000 --> 02:53:26.000]  The quintessential punk man is the misfit.
[02:53:26.000 --> 02:53:29.000]  And all three of their singers have been amazing.
[02:53:29.000 --> 02:53:34.000]  And it's all not for children to listen to, but it's pretty good.
[02:53:34.000 --> 02:53:36.000]  Pretty good to say the least.
[02:53:36.000 --> 02:53:38.000]  Started with Evil Elvis and just moved on from there.
[02:53:38.000 --> 02:53:42.000]  Let's go to Tim in Seattle. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[02:53:42.000 --> 02:53:45.000]  Hey, Alex, how's it going? What an amazing show.
[02:53:45.000 --> 02:53:50.000]  I'm the guy in Seattle that's been bullhornin' the Gates Foundation. You had me on the show last year.
[02:53:50.000 --> 02:53:51.000]  Yes, I did.
[02:53:51.000 --> 02:53:56.000]  I just want to encourage everybody to not live in fear. We must live in freedom.
[02:53:56.000 --> 02:53:59.000]  It's important that we do that.
[02:53:59.000 --> 02:54:09.000]  So as far as the reaction to what Trump's call for protest and everybody, even if they're doing that, and Trump might not...
[02:54:09.000 --> 02:54:13.000]  Even though they're going to try to provide the turret, we're watching this time. We know what to look for. I agree.
[02:54:13.000 --> 02:54:16.000]  We shouldn't have our free speech chilled.
[02:54:16.000 --> 02:54:23.000]  No, we shouldn't. Like I said earlier on Harrison's show, we should have been protesting the entire time.
[02:54:23.000 --> 02:54:28.000]  And in honor of the Proud Boys and the Patriots locked up, I made a decision to never stop.
[02:54:28.000 --> 02:54:34.000]  So it's important. And I'm curious, because you were saying that that foundation, that Mystery Foundation,
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:43.000]  are they afraid of your show because I'm out there in their parking lot and their driveway bullhorning your broadcast live?
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:49.000]  Well, I'll cut it from three foundations to two. No, it's not the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[02:54:49.000 --> 02:54:54.000]  It's the Rockefeller Foundation or it's the Carnegie Foundation, which is the same thing.
[02:54:54.000 --> 02:54:58.000]  But I mean, it's the same thing. Bill Gates is their minion.
[02:54:58.000 --> 02:55:05.000]  Yeah, Bill Gates is their minion. I mean, but he's got no power over me because I'm not fearing what he can do to me.
[02:55:05.000 --> 02:55:08.000]  I'm fearing what I can do to the future if I don't act.
[02:55:08.000 --> 02:55:14.000]  Brother, keep it up. I'll give you an example. Two years ago, they attacked Joe Rogan for having me on and said,
[02:55:14.000 --> 02:55:22.000]  Jones made it up that Bill Gates said 80 percent of people taking the shot are getting sick in their in their study.
[02:55:22.000 --> 02:55:28.000]  Joe just played the clip of him on CBS News admitting it. That got last time I checked 10 million views.
[02:55:28.000 --> 02:55:34.000]  It had over a million comments and literally you could read for two hours.
[02:55:34.000 --> 02:55:41.000]  The comments on Instagram. Thank you, Tim. You could read the comments for two hours.
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:44.000]  And not find one pro Bill Gates comment.
[02:55:44.000 --> 02:55:48.000]  So now he's on a world tour. What a great guy he is and all this crap.
[02:55:48.000 --> 02:55:52.000]  And I meant to hit that yesterday. I barely covered it.
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:56:04.000]  That guy's pulled it from the Sunday stack so tomorrow I can cover it out of Stephen Crowder studios.
[02:56:04.000 --> 02:56:09.000]  ABC News admits more polio caused by Bill Gates vaccine again.
[02:56:09.000 --> 02:56:11.000]  I mean, you just can't make that up.
[02:56:11.000 --> 02:56:15.000]  We're going to break spring and others. We're going to come right back to you.
[02:56:15.000 --> 02:56:26.000]  But I'm going to say this again. Info Wars is operating in the absolute edge of black.
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:30.000]  And God just keeps us there right on the edge of black, right on the edge of red.
[02:56:30.000 --> 02:56:38.000]  And if I don't admit that to you and if I don't beg you, then it's my fault we go under.
[02:56:38.000 --> 02:56:41.000]  So we've got great products you need and we really need your support.
[02:56:41.000 --> 02:56:45.000]  That's why they have articles every day saying Alex Jones has hundreds of millions of dollars.
[02:56:45.000 --> 02:56:48.000]  Alex Jones, none of it's true, folks.
[02:56:48.000 --> 02:56:55.000]  On my children may I be struck by lightning if I've got a million dollars cash or if we're not in trouble and I'm lying.
[02:56:55.000 --> 02:57:04.000]  I don't like to tempt God, but in front of everybody, I swear to you on my children that everything I've said here has been consciously true.
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:10.000]  Doesn't mean I don't make mistakes sometimes, but when it comes to finances, I can tell you we are out of money.
[02:57:10.000 --> 02:57:12.000]  We're just paying the bills. We need support.
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:17.000]  I need you to decide to keep us on air and go to infowarstore.com and get the best CBD oil.

[02:58:03.000 --> 02:58:07.000]  The way it makes your gums feel what it does to your mouth is insane.
[02:58:07.000 --> 02:58:12.000]  We know turmeric is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory and does such great things for the body.
[02:58:12.000 --> 02:58:15.000]  Then you add that with tea tree oil and a bunch of other essential oils.

[02:58:53.000 --> 02:58:55.000]  You know why? He can put you ahead of the curve.
[02:58:55.000 --> 02:58:59.000]  And he's been demonized as a conspiracy theorist.
[02:58:59.000 --> 02:59:02.000]  Think about how frustrated we are if you've been awake for a year or two.
[02:59:02.000 --> 02:59:08.000]  Imagine being like an Alex Jones or those guys who've been awake for like decades.
[02:59:08.000 --> 02:59:11.000]  Alex has been right on for over a decade.
[02:59:11.000 --> 02:59:12.000]  This is reality.
[02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.000]  It's just pancake.
[02:59:14.000 --> 02:59:16.000]  Truth is stranger than fiction.
[02:59:16.000 --> 02:59:18.000]  A revolution of peaceful information is coming.
[02:59:18.000 --> 02:59:21.000]  And when it comes time, you people are going to be brought to punishment.
[02:59:21.000 --> 02:59:23.000]  You're lying to the public. It's disgusting.
[02:59:23.000 --> 02:59:27.000]  The media continues to misrepresent what I've said.
[02:59:27.000 --> 02:59:30.000]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist.
[02:59:30.000 --> 02:59:34.000]  Alex Jones has the largest audience in the country.
[02:59:34.000 --> 02:59:38.000]  Bigger than any of the networks, the biggest megaphone in the country.
[02:59:38.000 --> 02:59:46.000]  We're going to get fired on about the real things, the things that matter.
[02:59:46.000 --> 02:59:48.000]  Burn in hell, New World Order.
[02:59:48.000 --> 03:00:06.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:08.000]  Spring in Missouri, thank you for calling in today.
[03:00:08.000 --> 03:00:10.000]  Great to have you with us. Go ahead.
[03:00:10.000 --> 03:00:11.000]  How you doing, Alex?
[03:00:11.000 --> 03:00:16.000]  I just want to say also, you know, I really got mad when I saw your court cases on TV.
[03:00:16.000 --> 03:00:18.000]  It was really, it really aggravated me.
[03:00:18.000 --> 03:00:21.000]  So I started getting stuff from you. Keep doing what you're doing.
[03:00:21.000 --> 03:00:24.000]  But, you know, everybody's always talking about why indict Trump.
[03:00:24.000 --> 03:00:29.000]  You know, he's going to surely win and all that stuff, even though they cheated the last election.
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:36.000]  But what I was wondering is, is it a, is it a possibility they might want to try to assassinate him either as he's going?
[03:00:36.000 --> 03:00:41.000]  Your phone's over modulating. I'm really, I heard the first part of what you're saying.
[03:00:41.000 --> 03:00:44.000]  Just back off a little bit.
[03:00:44.000 --> 03:00:47.000]  Okay. I'm going to take it off the speaker.
[03:00:47.000 --> 03:00:48.000]  Hold on.
[03:00:48.000 --> 03:00:50.000]  Okay. Can you hear me better now?
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:54.000]  Yeah, that's a rule. Let's not do talk radio on speaker. Go ahead.
[03:00:54.000 --> 03:00:56.000]  I'm trying to take it.
[03:00:56.000 --> 03:00:57.000]  It's okay. Go ahead.
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:10.000]  Anyway, okay. So I was just wondering, is there a possibility that maybe the reason they want to do this indictment is to actually assassinate him on the way to the jail or whatever, or on the way back?
[03:01:10.000 --> 03:01:13.000]  Yeah, they, they, they could buy Jeffrey Epstein.
[03:01:13.000 --> 03:01:17.000]  That's why the Secret Services saying they're going to stay with him even if he's in jail.
[03:01:17.000 --> 03:01:18.000]  I mean, look.
[03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:26.000]  I was just even wondering if when they're just driving him to the jail, if at that point with all the protesters, let's say protesters, they'll be out there.
[03:01:26.000 --> 03:01:31.000]  There might be a lot of people out there that would be a time that they could take advantage of.
[03:01:31.000 --> 03:01:35.000]  No, I mean, I think that's a great point. I think, I think anything's possible.
[03:01:35.000 --> 03:01:47.000]  And then I also wanted to ask you real quick, that one guy was talking about petition in the court. Didn't some of the court cases for the 2020 election petition in the court and they still got denied?
[03:01:47.000 --> 03:01:53.000]  I think he was generally talking about petitions for recalls of politicians.
[03:01:53.000 --> 03:02:05.000]  Okay, because I wondered if we could just, if some lawyer would start like a class action lawsuit against, they keep saying it's a big lie. Well, let's, let's have you prove that it's a big lie.
[03:02:05.000 --> 03:02:08.000]  Would we be able to produce evidence in a court of law?
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:10.000]  Well, here's the bottom line.
[03:02:10.000 --> 03:02:13.000]  We know they had a bunch of people vote for dead folks.
[03:02:13.000 --> 03:02:17.000]  The machine stuff hasn't really been proven. It's happened in past elections.
[03:02:17.000 --> 03:02:25.000]  But the manipulation of algorithms and news and blocking of stories and expose the Democrats like the Hunter Biden laptop is election meddling.
[03:02:25.000 --> 03:02:34.000]  So they did election metal in the 2020 election and the 2022. So that's all confirmed. I appreciate your call.
[03:02:34.000 --> 03:02:37.000]  Kenny in Wisconsin, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[03:02:37.000 --> 03:02:46.000]  Hi, Alex. Hey, thanks for having Barnes on. Thanks for all your great callers. And by the way, by 27 years listening to you. Thank you so much.
[03:02:46.000 --> 03:02:47.000]  Love you, brother.
[03:02:47.000 --> 03:02:57.000]  All right. Well, man, oh, man, I tell you, here we go again. Another attack, you know, by the, the hating Marxist devil crabs and leftist lawyers.
[03:02:57.000 --> 03:03:06.000]  They're just, they're insane. Anyhow, you know, I'm kind of wondering, I voted by twice for Trump now and, and we got the upcoming campaigns coming.
[03:03:06.000 --> 03:03:22.000]  And with that being said, I hope this time, Alex, that Trump, if he got to be really loaded with some just absolute facts, truth, proved to be able to drop bombshell after bombshell.
[03:03:22.000 --> 03:03:39.000]  That he and his non backing stabbing swampers, or whoever they may be, could get their minds blown in the mainstream media. In other words, that, that his backers have got his back this time for sure.
[03:03:39.000 --> 03:03:48.000]  Oh, I think, I think no doubt Trump said on the ball, bring down the new order. I'll bring down the deep state. There is no doubt Trump gets back in. He's going to war with these people.
[03:03:48.000 --> 03:04:00.000]  You know, just wondering, I mean, I wonder if him and his crew, everybody that's backing them. I just wonder, Alex, if they've really got something under their table secretly, that's never been leaked out.
[03:04:00.000 --> 03:04:05.000]  And he's got something big that we're, we just don't know about yet.
[03:04:05.000 --> 03:04:15.000]  Well, I know this, if they got it, they should release it now. We need to fire our political torpedoes of truth now. No one should sit on anything. I appreciate your call.
[03:04:15.000 --> 03:04:20.000]  All right. Royce White is set to take over.
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:26.000]  I just did his show last week. I promise to get to every caller. So I'll come back in 60 seconds.
[03:04:26.000 --> 03:04:36.000]  I'm going to give Mike and Marilyn a minute and a half, and I'm going to introduce the great Royce White is kicking ass on the other side, info wars.com, news wars.com, band.video.
[03:04:36.000 --> 03:04:50.000]  And then I'm going to drive up to Dallas tonight. I'll be co-hosting with Stephen Crowder, Tuesday and Wednesday, kicking off his new show for millions of viewers, and I'll be hosting my show from Dallas.
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:58.000]  So look for that. But in one hour, Owen Schreuer takes over at 3pm Central. Stay with us.
[03:04:58.000 --> 03:05:07.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, info wars has proven itself the last 28 years to be over the globalist target and having the biggest effect out there against those tyrants.
[03:05:07.000 --> 03:05:12.000]  And we fund our operation with viewers and listeners support while selling you great products at the same time.
[03:05:12.000 --> 03:05:19.000]  So I want to thank all the viewers and listeners of support to some of the years by spreading the word, praying for the broadcast and buying product.

[03:05:54.000 --> 03:05:58.000]  So make the decision to enrich your life and keep us on air infowars.com.
[03:05:58.000 --> 03:06:26.000]  All right, we're into hour number four, the great Royce White former NBA player MMA fighter, constitutional congressional candidate who just gets better and better.
[03:06:26.000 --> 03:06:30.000]  He's a great top show host. It's about to take over to this show last week. It was amazing.
[03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:36.000]  But I promise to get every caller on the board. The last one here of the calls we took, we'd have unlimited great callers.
[03:06:36.000 --> 03:06:39.000]  I could take 50 hours of calls. Maybe we should do a show like that.
[03:06:39.000 --> 03:06:45.000]  But Mike, you're the last caller on the board from Maryland on the Trump indictment that they say is happening tomorrow. Go ahead.
[03:06:45.000 --> 03:06:57.000]  Good afternoon, Alex. Long time listener, first time caller. So I've been thinking about this Trump indictment. I think the timing is highly suspicious.
[03:06:57.000 --> 03:07:17.000]  I believe a Trump indictment and arrest could be a false flag that the deep state needs to blame a collapsing banking system on if they can get enough people to riot, especially with provocateurs involved in the mayhem that goes along with it.
[03:07:17.000 --> 03:07:27.000]  It could collapse the banking system and the deep state and say, hey, it's Trump's fault. I mean, why not? They blame him for everything else.
[03:07:27.000 --> 03:07:33.000]  I totally agree with you. I'm not saying it's going to happen, but it's definitely something in their playbook because it's a very reckless thing to do.
[03:07:33.000 --> 03:07:42.000]  Never been done in US history before. So the fact they're getting ready to do it, I think all options are on the table for the enemy.
[03:07:42.000 --> 03:07:51.000]  I agree. I think the best thing Trump supporters could do would be to not take the bait and stay at home.
[03:07:51.000 --> 03:07:58.000]  Well, you know, I don't want to get in the game and tell people to not go protest and I get you're not saying that. You're saying that's your opinion and I respect your opinion.
[03:07:58.000 --> 03:08:09.000]  But I wouldn't go to DC. I wouldn't go to areas like New York, but I would have like church events and demonstrations in front of capitals and then put it out over the Internet to show we don't support it.
[03:08:09.000 --> 03:08:20.000]  Because people think going out and protesting is important. More important is the backdrop of a capitol and a bunch of people protesting so that millions or hundreds of thousands conservatively watch it and then we win.
[03:08:20.000 --> 03:08:31.000]  But I hear you and I appreciate your call. Well, we're about to get Royce White's take on all this. RoyceWhite.substack.com, RoyceWhite.us and on Twitter, highway underscore 30.
[03:08:31.000 --> 03:08:41.000]  Royce White is our guest toes taking over right now and it's great to have him here with us. Royce, take it away.
[03:08:41.000 --> 03:08:49.000]  Thanks, Alex. I appreciate the time. Once again, thank you to the entire info wars team. Thank you to the entire info wars audience for having me.
[03:08:49.000 --> 03:08:58.000]  I can't tell you how much I get feedback on a daily basis that people were first introduced to me on on this show here and I really appreciate that.
[03:08:58.000 --> 03:09:10.000]  Tonight, my podcast will air again at 9 p.m. Central on YouTube and we really like premiering on YouTube and we love having figures like Alex Jones on YouTube.
[03:09:10.000 --> 03:09:27.000]  I remember the day that they banned Alex Jones from YouTube. It was a dark day, but it was a day that I remember clear and I told myself I had the opportunity to have a podcast and interview Alex Jones and then we would bring him back on YouTube as much as we can and we look forward to having him again in the future.
[03:09:27.000 --> 03:09:46.000]  Tonight's episode on the podcast will cover much of what I'm going to cover here today and that is the wild, wildly tyrannical Trump indictment and you know, here's what we have to consider and you know, I go deep in my podcast.
[03:09:46.000 --> 03:10:00.000]  I go all the way to the root and I talk about the human condition and I talk about what led us here and the trajectory of history and the entire deal. So if you get a chance to tune in tonight at 9 p.m. on on YouTube, please call me crazy.
[03:10:00.000 --> 03:10:08.000]  But I'm going to say it here again because I think this is one of the most spiritual alive spiritually alive audiences and audiences in the world.
[03:10:08.000 --> 03:10:22.000]  And this is a this is a completely spiritual matter. And yes, you know, the entire war is spiritual. It's all spiritual warfare, you could say at a level, but but this is a spiritual matter in a different sense.
[03:10:22.000 --> 03:10:37.000]  And this is the neocon neoliberal order or the the normalcy that has grown out of a post post enlightenment techno technological world.
[03:10:37.000 --> 03:10:44.000]  Getting people to voluntarily surrender their rights and their freedom for two prominent things, security and materialism.
[03:10:44.000 --> 03:10:59.000]  Probably, you know, if you've heard me on the show before you've heard me stress that but we really have to stress it here today with this Donald Trump news coming down because effectively what the federal government is saying is we're too big to be held accountable.
[03:10:59.000 --> 03:11:24.000]  We're too big, we're too powerful, our scope, the reach of our governances is too much for you to resist. And what's scary, what's most worrisome is that in many ways they're correct because in many ways, on both sides of the aisle, we've had this this concession of freedom for for security and materialism.
[03:11:24.000 --> 03:11:42.000]  And right now, what's being waged against Donald Trump, what's being waged against all American citizens is the rule of law, right? They're going to use the rule of law to tell a story that no, no one man is bigger than the law, even the president of the United States,
[03:11:42.000 --> 03:11:58.000]  even a former president. And we all should have saw this day coming. Alex Jones certainly saw this day coming. That's why many of you tune in and listen to him. But for all those out there that still continue to say that he's crazy and whatnot.
[03:11:58.000 --> 03:12:14.000]  You can tell yourself that they're going after Donald Trump because Donald Trump is, you know, a jerk or Donald Trump is a racist or Donald Trump is a white nationalist or as a conspiracy theorist or whatever you want to say, you can tell yourself that story.
[03:12:14.000 --> 03:12:28.000]  But the reality is the apparatus is swinging around, they're swinging the cannons around and they're aiming them right at you. And Donald Trump is just an example. He's an example of one of the most energetic grassroots movements in recent political history,
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:42.000]  maybe in political history, all of political history, all of American history, one of the most energetic grassroots movements that we have. And if they can take him out, what they're saying is your movements don't matter.
[03:12:42.000 --> 03:12:55.000]  Your movements don't matter. You're not really willing to die for what you believe in. You're not really ready to even fight for what you believe in, let alone sacrifice any huge part of your daily life.
[03:12:55.000 --> 03:13:07.000]  And that is a testament of where American citizenship is today. It's a testament of where the corruption of the establishment and the status quo is. But it's also a reflection of where the citizens are today.
[03:13:07.000 --> 03:13:24.000]  And I just continue to harken to the citizens that we have to decide here and now, whether it's this Donald Trump situation, whether it's this banking collapse in the Federal Reserve with these liquidity swaps and basically bailing out the entire
[03:13:24.000 --> 03:13:39.000]  world banking system or the Western banking system or the trilateral banking system on the back of the American taxpayer, we have to decide right here, COVID shot, the list goes on, we have to decide right here right now.
[03:13:39.000 --> 03:13:49.000]  What are we willing to tolerate? What does American citizenship really mean to us? What does it mean to us? What is it served as? What will it mean in the future?
[03:13:49.000 --> 03:13:58.000]  What can and will we do to save this nation and to save ourselves in the process?
[03:13:58.000 --> 03:14:10.000]  And I was on Whitlock today and you can tune in at Jason Whitlock at 6pm central on YouTube as well and we went over this exact topic there as well.
[03:14:10.000 --> 03:14:25.000]  This is one of the darkest days in this Republic's history. Even the proposition that a former president would be arrested and targeted by his political opponents for being a dissident and make no mistake about it, regardless of how you feel about
[03:14:25.000 --> 03:14:36.000]  Donald Trump in many ways, he's a dissident. Okay, anytime you dissent against the prevailing status quo narrative on as many different issues as he has, you're a dissident.
[03:14:36.000 --> 03:14:45.000]  I don't care if you agree with his level of dissidence, I don't care if you are in alignment on key issues, doesn't matter. The point is dissidents are being targeted.
[03:14:45.000 --> 03:14:54.000]  When that happens, we no longer live in a republic. These are kangaroo courts. These are weaponized courts.
[03:14:54.000 --> 03:15:09.000]  And what makes it even worse is they insult your intelligence. They tell you that it's about his taxes or it's about having sex with Stormy Daniels or him paying off all of the, I mean, how stupid do you have to be?
[03:15:09.000 --> 03:15:18.000]  How dumb do you have to be to even believe something like that? Of course it has nothing to do with those things. Of course it has nothing to do with those. This isn't about his taxes.
[03:15:18.000 --> 03:15:31.000]  They're all running it. The entire system is run on tax loopholes. We all know it. It's ridiculous. Anybody who even forwards the notion that it's about taxes is completely and utterly out of their mind or they're 100% in on the scam.
[03:15:31.000 --> 03:15:40.000]  This isn't about sexual improprieties. That's ridiculous. Sexual impropriety is the backbone of this entire culture.
[03:15:40.000 --> 03:15:50.000]  It's been the backbone of American culture for a long time, but it's definitely the backbone of the 21st century and the social media or a big technocracy culture.
[03:15:50.000 --> 03:15:58.000]  I can't go on Instagram without seeing the naked girl's butt. I mean, this is absurd.
[03:15:58.000 --> 03:16:16.000]  One thing the New York Times got wrong, amongst almost everything else they got wrong and their big hit piece has been put all over every newspaper I've seen since it's everywhere, including in the local statesmen, is that we're booming here and that we've just rivers of money and rivers of gold and rivers of diamonds.
[03:16:16.000 --> 03:16:27.000]  None of that's true. It's kind of apropos that Info Wars is barely paying the bills, so they're wanting all this money that doesn't exist, but we don't want to be too good at that and have zero money.
[03:16:27.000 --> 03:16:40.000]  In fact, I'd like to have plenty of money to fight the appeals and move forward. There's been big rulings in Texas and federally and almost every mainline analyst at the AP says that their trials will be overturned.
[03:16:40.000 --> 03:16:51.000]  They have to be or there's no First Amendment. People say, well, then why are you in bankruptcy? Because they had weaponized state judges start getting ready to sign orders to seize the infrastructure and close the building and they said that that was their plan.
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:59.000]  And so we were out of money. It is a real bankruptcy, but listeners then thought, oh my God, you are going under and that almost created what they wanted.
[03:16:59.000 --> 03:17:09.000]  Massive support was withdrawn six, eight months ago when the bankruptcies began. People really thought we were going to be closing. No, it's Chapter 11, Sub Chapter 5, which is a reorganization.
[03:17:09.000 --> 03:17:19.000]  So I want to just make that announcement to listeners again that this is all in 100% good faith to put my cards on the table and to try to come to some settlement issue with these people based on reality.
[03:17:19.000 --> 03:17:24.000]  To close that chapter and move on so info works to be more effective at getting truth out than ever.
[03:17:24.000 --> 03:17:38.000]  But if they don't go along with that, then it's all in the law that we will move forward with a settlement trust so that any profits are put into a settlement trust in the future on the appeals that are three to four years and almost every expert agrees they will lose.
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:44.000]  I don't want to talk about us personally anymore, but I get the questions all the time in text messages and on the street and you know, the crew asked me all the time.
[03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:49.000]  Any other points you want to add on that Mars will go to calls start the next hour and all the other days.
[03:17:49.000 --> 03:17:58.000]  Just at the key is the audience. The whole goal was to separate the audience the same way that the Trump indictment is trying to separate Trump from his audience from his base from his supporters.
[03:17:58.000 --> 03:18:10.000]  The goal of the law fair against Alex Jones at Info Wars was all about stopping the audience from having its voice heard through Alex Jones through Info Wars through sharing the links through continuing to support it.
[03:18:10.000 --> 03:18:14.000]  That's what they explicitly said in the Connecticut press conference right after the Connecticut verdict.
[03:18:14.000 --> 03:18:20.000]  They they made an explicit and express call please Info War store supporters stop supporting Info Wars.
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:35.000]  So the if you want to continue to get back at protecting the First Amendment and continue to support independent populist information that was ahead of the curve on almost everything, whether it was global war, whether it was the pandemic, whether it was Epstein,
[03:18:35.000 --> 03:18:42.000]  whether it was any of these scandals, whether it was the Biden family, whether it was Biden's bad health. There was a reason people forget that's why they kicked off of Instagram.
[03:18:42.000 --> 03:18:49.000]  You exposed Biden's first order exposed Biden serious health problems, which now are a constant meme and source of comedy.
[03:18:49.000 --> 03:18:57.000]  The best way to do that is to continue to support info wars at info wars store.com and I speak from personal lived experience.
[03:18:57.000 --> 03:18:59.000]  I've been a supporter for the better part of a decade.
[03:18:59.000 --> 03:19:11.000]  I continue to mostly because it's great products at a group at a great price, but I love supporting something that keeps free populist information on the air out to the American people.
[03:19:11.000 --> 03:19:13.000]  This is a perspective you don't get anywhere else.
[03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:20.000]  If you want to keep it, if you want to keep the First Amendment, if you want to keep this voice on the air, continue to support info wars store.com.
[03:19:20.000 --> 03:19:32.000]  Find something you like that you need anyway at an affordable, accessible price and get back at the deep state because this is still the best public tool against the deep state that exists.
[03:19:32.000 --> 03:19:41.000]  That's the reason why it was such a target for the last half decade and there's nobody that does that better than the info wars audience and they do it better by continuing to support info wars,
[03:19:41.000 --> 03:19:50.000]  keeping it on the air despite all the assaults and attacks, all the lies and all the libels by going to infowarstore.com and finding things they support.
[03:20:12.000 --> 03:20:15.000]  Welcome back. Welcome back.
[03:20:15.000 --> 03:20:18.000]  My name is Royce White. I'm your guest host for the hour.
[03:20:18.000 --> 03:20:22.000]  I am here in Minneapolis, Minnesota in the belly of the beast at Free People Radio.
[03:20:22.000 --> 03:20:28.000]  Please, please tune in tonight to my podcast airing at 9 p.m. Central on YouTube.
[03:20:28.000 --> 03:20:31.000]  That's please call me crazy on YouTube if you haven't already.
[03:20:31.000 --> 03:20:45.000]  Go back and check out the great Alex Jones who we interviewed last Friday and it was epic to say the least legendary a true honor and I'm honored to be back here at info wars hosting during this most historic time.
[03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:52.000]  In that interview, I talked a little bit about this document, the National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism.
[03:20:52.000 --> 03:21:08.000]  And in this document, it basically lays out all the reasons why they should be able to take your rights and that terrorism, the apparatus that was formerly aimed at radical Islam is now aimed directly at you all.
[03:21:08.000 --> 03:21:20.000]  And when I say you all, I mean specifically Christians, white men, vaccine deniers, election integrity deniers and the list goes on, but really any dissident.
[03:21:20.000 --> 03:21:40.000]  And now, you know, in the culminating act in the climax of this document or this domestic terrorism, they go after a former president who by many people standards, if you if you venture to question the integrity of the 20, 20 election is in fact the sitting president.
[03:21:40.000 --> 03:21:51.000]  Now I won't make any definitive claims about the overall election, an integrity of the election, although I think our elections have had a lack of integrity for a long time on many fronts.
[03:21:51.000 --> 03:22:05.000]  Most, most importantly, I think campaign finance and the the infinite supply of contribution from the liberal mainstream media industrial complex.
[03:22:05.000 --> 03:22:11.000]  That would be the biggest example of campaign finance violation, in my opinion.
[03:22:11.000 --> 03:22:22.000]  But, but regardless, I mean, you know, this, this is the culminating event, this is the culminating act to go after the figurehead of one of the most energetic political movements in American history.
[03:22:22.000 --> 03:22:25.000]  And whether you like Donald Trump or not, it's not the point.
[03:22:25.000 --> 03:22:27.000]  It's just, it's just not the point.
[03:22:27.000 --> 03:22:36.000]  The point is that conservatives, Christians, Republicans all across this country have been have been called is what they've been.
[03:22:36.000 --> 03:22:39.000]  They've been they've been shepherded into a shooting gallery.
[03:22:39.000 --> 03:22:52.000]  They sit right over a target at X marks to spot and in the same place where they have abnegated their freedom for security, because that's more of a conservative, Republican, Christian motif.
[03:22:52.000 --> 03:22:54.000]  501c3 Christians at that.
[03:22:54.000 --> 03:22:57.000]  You know, it's, it's, oh, we want more police.
[03:22:57.000 --> 03:23:00.000]  You know, we want a stronger military.
[03:23:00.000 --> 03:23:01.000]  Right.
[03:23:01.000 --> 03:23:11.000]  We want, we want funding for federal agencies, federal intelligence community governing agencies like the FBI and the CIA and the NSA and so on and so forth.
[03:23:11.000 --> 03:23:23.000]  Everybody was having a ball when the NSA was preaching that they needed funding to surveil radical Islamic terrorists in the hills of Afghanistan or some other third world shit.
[03:23:23.000 --> 03:23:25.000]  Hole in order to keep you safe.
[03:23:25.000 --> 03:23:33.000]  Everybody clapped and we cheered and we said America's a guns blazing cowboy Western Western country that that can't be defeated.
[03:23:33.000 --> 03:23:35.000]  We know how to do war.
[03:23:35.000 --> 03:23:42.000]  Nobody stopped to think that eventually eventually domestic terrorism.
[03:23:42.000 --> 03:23:52.000]  A strategy against domestic terrorism and those same legal institutions would be aimed right at the former president of the United States.
[03:23:52.000 --> 03:23:54.000]  Alex Jones saw it.
[03:23:54.000 --> 03:23:55.000]  Alex Jones saw it.
[03:23:55.000 --> 03:23:56.000]  Some others saw it.
[03:23:56.000 --> 03:24:01.000]  But they were, they were a whistle in the wind, so to speak, in terms of a greater narrative.
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:02.000]  They were called crazy.
[03:24:02.000 --> 03:24:04.000]  They were called conspiracy theories.
[03:24:04.000 --> 03:24:05.000]  Oh, you're an alarmist.
[03:24:05.000 --> 03:24:07.000]  You're, you're anti government.
[03:24:07.000 --> 03:24:21.000]  In fact, it actually lays out that aside from being a racist or a white supremacist, being anti government is, is a qualification for domestic terrorism as if the grandiosity of the federal government couldn't get any bigger.
[03:24:21.000 --> 03:24:29.000]  They're actually now saying that no matter how corrupt the government may be, if you're anti government or anti corruption, you're, you're a terrorist.
[03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:46.000]  And in the same apparatus that they use to make you feel safe at night to make you lay your head down and feel this, this warm sense of security, this warm sense of security that will enable you to carry on with your radical materialism on a daily basis.
[03:24:46.000 --> 03:24:51.000]  Now they're going to swing it right around at you and the question remains.
[03:24:51.000 --> 03:25:10.000]  It's the question that we, we've had to ask ourselves and a number of times in this country's history, a question that we've, we've answered with a lack of righteousness at a number of times in this country's history, a question that now hangs over all of us like the sword of Damocles.
[03:25:10.000 --> 03:25:14.000]  How far we willing to let this federal government go?
[03:25:14.000 --> 03:25:21.000]  I mean, Alex is tied up in any number of court cases. Maybe he can't say it. Steve Bannon, he's tied up in a number of court cases. Maybe he can't say it.
[03:25:21.000 --> 03:25:28.000]  But, but I'm going to ask the question as a young 30 year old man, I absolutely think people should protest.
[03:25:28.000 --> 03:25:40.000]  And it's not because Donald Trump is being mistreated or treated unfairly or that this isn't just or that George Soros, you know, basically paid for the campaign of this district attorney,
[03:25:40.000 --> 03:25:47.000]  which is a, which is an example and a reflection of many district attorneys that he's put into power and finance campaign force all across the country.
[03:25:47.000 --> 03:25:50.000]  I mean, then we are living in occupied territory.
[03:25:50.000 --> 03:26:07.000]  I mean, when you let the people who are living, when you let the people who are foreign occupiers finance the political, the political administrations who put out documents on domestic terrorism, I would say the republic is now dead.
[03:26:07.000 --> 03:26:21.000]  The question is, how do we get it back? And absolutely, there is a need for a revolution of Christian ministry and last but certainly not least, Christian charity.
[03:26:21.000 --> 03:26:34.000]  And the two must go together. We need Christian ministry and we need Christian charity and we need it yesterday and we need it to be a priority and we need the demonstrations to be Christian driven.
[03:26:34.000 --> 03:26:47.000]  Where are all the Christians? Where have we been? We've been in our, we've been in our churches, we've been in our, you know, and in our homes with our Bibles and our little communities in our Bible studies.
[03:26:47.000 --> 03:26:52.000]  And that's all great. Christian community is great and believing in faith in the word is great.
[03:26:52.000 --> 03:27:16.000]  But at some point, you know, I just, I just see that one of the greatest info wars is that there are no righteous and divine wars that all Christians should just abnegate their, their, they should resign from the world and and only concern themselves with the metaphysical or the spiritual and let all the other chips fall where they will.
[03:27:16.000 --> 03:27:30.000]  I mean, yeah, okay, I guess, if that's what you, if that's, if that's the, if that's the, you know, the story you want to tell, I have a hard time believing that, that this country is as Christian as it claims to be.
[03:27:30.000 --> 03:27:37.000]  If that's the story we're going to tell, I have a hard time believing this country was ever as Christian as it claimed to be. And that's not a knock on Christianity.
[03:27:37.000 --> 03:27:50.000]  That's a knock on man taking the Lord's name in vain. And now we're being, you know, what, what, what's happening now is we're getting our bluff called right as a sportsman as a sportsman when I'm a fighter.
[03:27:50.000 --> 03:28:01.000]  And I pretend like I, like I, you know, like my game is sharp in one area, and you get another fighter who's smart enough and skilled enough and experienced enough, they'll call your bluff.
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:06.000]  Same thing with a basketball game, same thing with football, same thing with any competitive sport.
[03:28:06.000 --> 03:28:15.000]  You can only present a false narrative. You can only present a false position too long until you run up against somebody with the balls to call your bluff.
[03:28:15.000 --> 03:28:24.000]  And right now, a bunch of tyrannical, anti-American, globalist, Satanists are calling Christians bluff.
[03:28:24.000 --> 03:28:31.000]  They're saying, how much do you really believe in freedom? How much do you really believe in America? How much do you really believe in God?
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:36.000]  How much do you really believe in your own righteous position? How much do you really believe in your own ideas?
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:44.000]  Show us, show us, and we should rightfully be ready to live, fight and die for that position.
[03:28:44.000 --> 03:28:48.000]  And that's my opinion on the matter. I'll see you on the other side of the break.
[03:28:48.000 --> 03:28:55.000]  I'm your host Royce White and you are watching info wars here from Minneapolis and the belly of the beast.

[03:31:07.000 --> 03:31:09.000]  Biden is a puppet and is dissolving our borders.

[03:32:57.000 --> 03:33:04.000]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:33:04.000 --> 03:33:09.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to the belly of the beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[03:33:09.000 --> 03:33:14.000]  I'm your guest, Hozroy Swight, and I am here at Free People Radio.
[03:33:14.000 --> 03:33:18.000]  Right here at the news desk here for please call me crazy.
[03:33:18.000 --> 03:33:21.000]  My podcast will be airing tonight at 9 p.m. Central.
[03:33:21.000 --> 03:33:27.000]  Make sure you go check that out and also make sure that you go and watch the replay.
[03:33:27.000 --> 03:33:35.000]  Or the episode of myself and the great Alex Jones from last Friday.
[03:33:35.000 --> 03:33:41.000]  It was an incredible interview, a legendary interview, and I'm very thankful and honored to be able to have Alex Jones on my podcast.
[03:33:41.000 --> 03:33:43.000]  It's a dream come true, really.
[03:33:43.000 --> 03:33:46.000]  And to be able to host here on infowars.
[03:33:46.000 --> 03:33:53.000]  And, you know, it's a double-edged sword, because obviously it's a great honor.
[03:33:53.000 --> 03:33:58.000]  And privilege to be able to host on a platform that's spoken truth to power for so long.
[03:33:58.000 --> 03:34:03.000]  But at the same time, I'm conflicted because I'm able to do so at a time when all the things that Alex Jones predicted,
[03:34:03.000 --> 03:34:06.000]  or many of the things that Alex Jones predicted, come true.
[03:34:06.000 --> 03:34:13.000]  And them coming true is a testament of failure from us, from all of us who didn't heed the warning,
[03:34:13.000 --> 03:34:17.000]  or who didn't embrace the truth.
[03:34:17.000 --> 03:34:28.000]  And from us, from all of us who didn't heed the warning, or who didn't embrace the warning enough to catalyze that political action.
[03:34:28.000 --> 03:34:34.000]  You know, I'm new to this conservative movement, let's call it.
[03:34:34.000 --> 03:34:38.000]  I was born and raised a Christian, I was baptized a Christian, a Catholic.
[03:34:38.000 --> 03:34:41.000]  I know many people out there have their issues with Catholics.
[03:34:41.000 --> 03:34:47.000]  But now the domestic terrorists say that Catholics are the most dangerous people in the country, so that tells you something as well.
[03:34:47.000 --> 03:34:56.000]  Donald Trump, Catholics, Steve Bannon, Alex Jones, Royce White, you know, all those who said that Paul Pelosi may have been having an extramarital gay affair.
[03:34:56.000 --> 03:34:59.000]  We're the most dangerous people in the country.
[03:34:59.000 --> 03:35:04.000]  So, you know, I was raised up in the church, I was raised up as a Christian.
[03:35:04.000 --> 03:35:12.000]  And it bothers me the lukewarm nature of our Christian communities all across the country, and I know you may not like to hear that.
[03:35:12.000 --> 03:35:16.000]  I get it. I get it. Nobody wants to hold the mirror up to themselves.
[03:35:16.000 --> 03:35:30.000]  And we all want to sit around all day and complain and talk for hours and hours on end and text message each other and group chats and, you know, harp on about the latest headline from any number of one of these bad actors, you know,
[03:35:30.000 --> 03:35:39.000]  any one of these policies, any one of these people who intend to take your freedoms.
[03:35:39.000 --> 03:35:45.000]  But the real, again, I say the real question is, you know, we're so lukewarm.
[03:35:45.000 --> 03:35:48.000]  I mean, we really are lukewarm.
[03:35:48.000 --> 03:35:50.000]  It really boils down to it.
[03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:52.000]  So many of us are lukewarm.
[03:35:52.000 --> 03:36:04.000]  In the first couple of weeks of my podcast, I use profanity a lot and people, people, you know, messaging and calling and Christians or, you know, don't let anything foul come out of your mouth.
[03:36:04.000 --> 03:36:10.000]  It says that Bible chapter verse blah, blah, blah.
[03:36:10.000 --> 03:36:18.000]  The foul, the foul that comes out of people's mouths, biblically speaking, was talking about lies and deceit.
[03:36:18.000 --> 03:36:23.000]  I wasn't talking about the use of language, profanity, I was talking about the intent, the will.
[03:36:23.000 --> 03:36:28.000]  And when you say things like that, you really show a lack of biblical and theological understanding.
[03:36:28.000 --> 03:36:39.000]  Certainly spiritual intelligence or spiritual wisdom and discernment, because sin is a matter of the will first in your actions, secondarily.
[03:36:39.000 --> 03:36:51.000]  And this is a way where our American culture, a Western culture has been taken over by this sort of Judeo-Buddhist mentality, this Judeo-Buddhist worldview.
[03:36:51.000 --> 03:37:06.000]  And I say Judeo-Buddhist because they kind of co-opted all of the tenets, the foundational tenets of traditional Judaism and Christianity, but they've slapped a Buddhist marketing promotion over top of it.
[03:37:06.000 --> 03:37:21.000]  And they've done that for a specific reason because the Buddhist philosophy is one that says that your daily practice, your actions on a daily basis are the predicate for your existence, are the predicate for your spiritual health and your being.
[03:37:21.000 --> 03:37:26.000]  Christians don't believe that because we don't believe that this world is the only existence.
[03:37:26.000 --> 03:37:37.000]  We don't believe that this world is the only thing that's happening now or in perpetuity, into infinity, in the eternal.
[03:37:37.000 --> 03:37:48.000]  So it's not right for us to resign from society. It's not right for us to abnegate the fundamental will of sin.
[03:37:48.000 --> 03:38:01.000]  And I use that example and I go that deep to say, do you really think that it has more impact on your spiritual standing, your spiritual status if you use profanity,
[03:38:01.000 --> 03:38:11.000]  versus if you allow tyrants to rise up alongside you while you lace their pockets with your hard-earned dollars, with your hard-earned shekels,
[03:38:11.000 --> 03:38:18.000]  and exhort tyrannical rule over the people while they promote child sacrifice?
[03:38:18.000 --> 03:38:26.000]  I mean, I'm sitting here with a packet here from our previous Christina Caramo interview that was last Wednesday before the great Alex Jones.
[03:38:26.000 --> 03:38:37.000]  And right here from Newsweek, Christina Caramo says that the child sacrifice is a very satanic practice and that's precisely what abortion is.
[03:38:37.000 --> 03:38:45.000]  And this document lays it out as a wild conspiracy theory that is in support of Donald Trump.
[03:38:45.000 --> 03:38:48.000]  I mean, the whole predicate is laid out for you.
[03:38:48.000 --> 03:39:03.000]  So do we really have time to play chaperone to the words that people choose to use to pass judgment on fellow Christians about the profanity they choose to use
[03:39:03.000 --> 03:39:09.000]  to exalt the moment, to augment the moment and the severity and the urgency?
[03:39:09.000 --> 03:39:18.000]  Or is it that our own lukewarm Christianity across the span of time has seated the ground for Satanism to take over?
[03:39:18.000 --> 03:39:26.000]  I mean, which one has more spiritual and moral culpability? I wonder.
[03:39:26.000 --> 03:39:31.000]  Maybe it's the 501. I've said it before on the show, but I'll say it here again.
[03:39:31.000 --> 03:39:36.000]  This isn't a Christian nation. This is a 501c3 Christian nation.
[03:39:36.000 --> 03:39:39.000]  And that's an important distinction to make.
[03:39:39.000 --> 03:39:42.000]  Pay unto Caesar. Render unto Caesar.
[03:39:42.000 --> 03:39:47.000]  It's not a scripture about individual taxation.
[03:39:47.000 --> 03:39:59.000]  It's a scripture about religious institutions and spiritual institutions, spiritual leaders, spiritual guides, not being co-opted by the state, not being co-opted by the government.
[03:39:59.000 --> 03:40:05.000]  And there's a lot of 501c3 Christian institutions all across this great nation.
[03:40:05.000 --> 03:40:20.000]  And when they sit back and they allow this nation to move towards a satanic practice all around us with no rebuke, with no refute, that is the symbol of foulness of the mouth.
[03:40:20.000 --> 03:40:39.000]  When you go up to the pulpit, before the congregation, and you continue to preach the word of God as though there is no greater political circumstance that one must consider around their institution, in their community, in their greater community, in the greater nation.
[03:40:39.000 --> 03:40:43.000]  That's taking the Lord's name in vain. I mean, let's get granular about it.
[03:40:43.000 --> 03:40:50.000]  I mean, let's cut the bull.
[03:40:50.000 --> 03:40:55.000]  I can't cuss on Alex's show because he's on a lot of radio stations, so we can't cuss here.
[03:40:55.000 --> 03:41:02.000]  But on my podcast, I cuss nonstop. I'm going to continue to use profanity nonstop because I think people are jerk-offs.
[03:41:02.000 --> 03:41:06.000]  I'm just going to be honest. And it's not you in the audience. If it doesn't apply to you, it doesn't apply to you.
[03:41:06.000 --> 03:41:16.000]  But another thing is, when are we going to drop everything and support leaders who are really willing to say what needs to be said?
[03:41:16.000 --> 03:41:26.000]  And you may not agree with everything Donald Trump has to say. I surely don't, but he certainly was willing to say a bit more, a bit more honestly, a bit more forthright than many of his counterparts.
[03:41:26.000 --> 03:41:28.000]  Nobody can deny that.
[03:41:28.000 --> 03:41:36.000]  And they try and hang him or they try to, they're now trying to string him up on a cross for it. And that's why they're going after him.
[03:41:36.000 --> 03:41:40.000]  It has nothing to do with taxes. Give me a break. Give me a break.
[03:41:40.000 --> 03:41:54.000]  The same sexual perverse pedophiles that want your kids to be able to talk about sex and not only sex, but transgender sex lifestyle at their schools without your consent.
[03:41:54.000 --> 03:42:10.000]  These people are concerned about the morals and ethics and values and righteousness or legitimacy of Donald Trump's sexual exploits and any financial implications that are connected to it.
[03:42:10.000 --> 03:42:13.000]  The integrity of campaign finance. Are you kidding me?
[03:42:13.000 --> 03:42:33.000]  I ran against Ilhan Omar, all conventional wisdom say that she married her brother to get passage into this country only to then divorce her brother and marry a guy who then became her campaign, you know, her campaign manager who gets $20,000 a month.
[03:42:33.000 --> 03:42:43.000]  In fact, the Democrats transferred exactly $20,000 a month from the DNC, from the Ohio DNC to the Minnesota DNC and then paid him.
[03:42:43.000 --> 03:42:51.000]  I mean, are we really going to talk about ethics? How long are we going to put up with this? How long are we going to tolerate this tearing? Ask yourself.
[03:42:51.000 --> 03:42:57.000]  I'll see you on the other side. My name is Royce White. This is The Bell and the Beast, Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[03:42:57.000 --> 03:43:05.000]  One thing the New York Times got wrong amongst almost everything else they got wrong and their big hit piece has been put all over every newspaper.
[03:43:05.000 --> 03:43:16.000]  I've seen it since everywhere, including in the local statesmen, is that we're booming here and that we've just rivers of money and rivers of gold and rivers of diamonds.
[03:43:16.000 --> 03:43:21.000]  None of that's true. It's kind of apropos that Info Wars is barely paying the bills.
[03:43:21.000 --> 03:43:27.000]  So they're wanting all this money that doesn't exist, but we don't want to be too good at that and have zero money.
[03:43:27.000 --> 03:43:32.000]  In fact, I'd like to have plenty of money to fight the appeals and move forward.
[03:43:32.000 --> 03:43:41.000]  There's been big rulings in Texas and federally and almost every mainline analyst, including at the AP, says that their trials will be overturned.
[03:43:41.000 --> 03:43:44.000]  They have to be or there's no First Amendment. People say, well, then why are you in bankruptcy?
[03:43:44.000 --> 03:43:51.000]  Because they had weaponized state judges start getting ready to sign orders to seize the infrastructure and close the building. And they said that that was their plan.
[03:43:51.000 --> 03:43:57.000]  And so we were out of money. It is a real bankruptcy, but listeners then thought, oh my God, you are going under.
[03:43:57.000 --> 03:44:03.000]  And that almost created what they wanted. Massive support was withdrawn six, eight months ago when the bankruptcies began.
[03:44:03.000 --> 03:44:09.000]  People really thought we were going to be closing. No, it's Chapter 11, Sub Chapter 5, which is a reorganization.
[03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:19.000]  So I want to just make that announcement to listeners again that this is all in 100% good faith to put my cards on the table and to try to come to some settlement issue with these people based on reality.
[03:44:19.000 --> 03:44:24.000]  To close that chapter and move on so info works to be more effective at getting truth out than ever.
[03:44:24.000 --> 03:44:38.000]  But if they don't go along with that, then it's all in the law that we will move forward with a settlement trust so that any profits are put into a settlement trust in the future on the appeals that are three to four years and almost every expert agrees they will lose.
[03:44:38.000 --> 03:44:44.000]  I don't want to talk about us personally anymore, but I get the questions all the time in text messages and on the street and you know, the crew asked me all the time.
[03:44:44.000 --> 03:44:49.000]  Any other points you want to add on that Barnes will go to calls start the next hour and get all the other news.
[03:44:49.000 --> 03:44:58.000]  Just at the key is the audience. The whole goal was to separate the audience the same way that the Trump indictment is trying to separate Trump from his audience from his base from his supporters.
[03:44:58.000 --> 03:45:10.000]  The goal of the law fair against Alex Jones and info wars was all about stopping the audience from having its voice heard through Alex Jones through info wars through sharing the links through continuing to support it.
[03:45:10.000 --> 03:45:20.000]  That's what they explicitly said in the Connecticut press conference right after the Connecticut verdict. They they made explicit and express call please info war store supporters stop supporting info wars.
[03:45:20.000 --> 03:45:33.000]  So the if you want to continue to get back at protecting the First Amendment and continue to support independent populist information that was ahead of the curve on almost everything, whether it was global war, whether it was the pandemic,
[03:45:33.000 --> 03:45:39.000]  whether it was Epstein, whether it was any of these scandals, whether it was the Biden family, whether it was Biden's bad health.
[03:45:39.000 --> 03:45:49.000]  There was a reason people forget that's why they kicked off of Instagram. You expose Biden's first one to expose Biden serious health problems, which now are a constant meme and source of comedy.
[03:45:49.000 --> 03:45:57.000]  The best way to do that is to continue to support info wars at info wars store calm and I speak from personal lived experience.
[03:45:57.000 --> 03:46:03.000]  I've been a supporter for the better part of a decade. I continue to mostly because it's great products at a group at a great price.
[03:46:03.000 --> 03:46:11.000]  But I love supporting something that keeps pre populist information on the air out to the American people.
[03:46:11.000 --> 03:46:21.000]  This is a perspective you don't get anywhere else. If you want to keep it, if you want to keep the First Amendment, if you want to keep this voice on the air, continue to support info wars store calm.
[03:46:21.000 --> 03:46:32.000]  Find something you like that you need anyway at an affordable accessible price and get back at the deep state because this is still the best public tool against the deep state that exists.
[03:46:32.000 --> 03:46:42.000]  That's the reason why it was such a target for the last half decade and there's nobody that does that better than the info wars audience and they do it better by continuing to support info wars, keeping it on the air.
[03:46:42.000 --> 03:47:06.000]  Despite all the assaults and attacks, all the lies and all the libels by going to info wars store calm and finding things they support.
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:21.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, I am Roy Schweitzer guest host for the hour and we are at the close of the hour here in the belly of the beast Minneapolis, Minnesota.
[03:47:21.000 --> 03:47:34.000]  And I'm extremely honored and proud to be able to host here on info wars, one of the most historic and legendary platforms of information fighting against the machine in the history of this country and of the world.
[03:47:34.000 --> 03:47:45.000]  I thank you for your viewership for your listenership for all your feedback every time I'm on Alex Jones and show on his platform I get a ton of feedback from people all across the country all across the world.
[03:47:45.000 --> 03:47:59.000]  And we're especially appreciative to all of those who saw me here that now translate to my podcast please call me crazy which airs at 9pm Central on YouTube if you haven't go and watch Friday's interview with Alex Jones I can't stress enough.
[03:47:59.000 --> 03:48:13.000]  I've watched Alex Jones all my life and I'm not just saying that to pat myself from the back but it was an incredible interview and he had some very very heartfelt and genuine moments, and we hope to get Alex Jones back on the podcast very soon.
[03:48:13.000 --> 03:48:31.000]  Tonight's episode I covered this very Donald Trump issue is the episode is entitled Soros tyranny and why I mean you know it just ironic. It's so ironic that this conversation or this indictment looms around issues such as campaign finance and the you know the
[03:48:31.000 --> 03:48:53.000]  misappropriation of campaign finance and it's like every single thing they do every single thing the enemy does not only do they do it in this sort of unabashed unabashed cocky manner, but they're willing to actually name it under the same the same exact set of
[03:48:53.000 --> 03:49:06.000]  corruption that they themselves are engaged in. I mean it's just a slap in the face the American people have been been slapped in the face since the day they killed John F Kennedy.
[03:49:06.000 --> 03:49:23.000]  You know when they when they when they put together the Warren Commission of all the people who probably had some knowledge or something to do with John F Kennedy assassination, and then they told you that the magic bullet theory was what should keep you comfortable and I should comfort you it should it should allow you to sleep well at night.
[03:49:23.000 --> 03:49:42.000]  This was the establishment the neocon neoliberal order the international banking cartel the three industrial complexes military medicine media, and what would eventually become big tech and the eye in the sky. This is the five headed hydro new world order slapping you in the face.
[03:49:42.000 --> 03:49:58.000]  It's saying yeah we know the founding fathers were pretty you know they were they were pretty pretty smart bunch they were pretty sharp group they they they put all these constitutional guard rails in against economic imperialism and tyranny but guess what you're so greedy.
[03:49:58.000 --> 03:50:15.000]  You know you're so detached you're so easy to fool you're so gullible you're such a jerk off it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how good your founding fathers where it doesn't matter how good your Messiah or savior or it doesn't matter how good the one true living God is you are a sucker.
[03:50:15.000 --> 03:50:31.000]  You're a sucker. We'll take your leaders will string your leaders up on a cross and oh by the way at the end of in the very same week you know what what what else will do. We will backstop the entire western banking system on your tax doll.
[03:50:31.000 --> 03:50:49.000]  Because you're a jerk off. I mean that's just the real reality you like jerking off more than you like freedom just come out and say it. Just come right on out and say that's what they want to tell you. And that's the animus that's the that's the urgency that's the emotion that you should have towards this establishment when you wake up in the morning
[03:50:49.000 --> 03:50:56.000]  and when you lay your head down tonight this establishment things that you're such a jerk off that they can do whatever they want and you'll take it.
[03:50:56.000 --> 03:51:12.000]  I think my favorite Alex Jones rant of all time was when he said no other species on the planet would allow a 250 pound man dressed like a space demon get up close to his kids.
[03:51:12.000 --> 03:51:34.000]  No no no giraffe no no zebra no monkey no no alligator no no wild coyote no hyenas no no hippo no other species on the planet would let a 250 pound man dressed like a space demon get up close to its kids.
[03:51:34.000 --> 03:51:50.000]  Only in a radical radical anti god post enlightenment post renaissance scientific method driven lunacy would we allow these kind of things to happen and you know before before we can even talk about the freedom I guess we have to start there.
[03:51:50.000 --> 03:52:06.000]  Because the concept of freedom the concept of democracy the concept of a republic the concept the concept of a nation and sovereignty and individual rights in a noble rights these are sophisticated intellectual developments that came underneath.
[03:52:06.000 --> 03:52:22.000]  Our founding fathers which were a culmination of rebellion against the crown and religious monarchy divine right of kings and blended with a new Jerusalem a new horizon of outlook on what it means to be a nation what it means to be a citizen.
[03:52:22.000 --> 03:52:24.000]  This was an anomaly.
[03:52:24.000 --> 03:52:32.000]  What America represents as a bastion against economic imperialism and satanic governance is an anomaly.
[03:52:32.000 --> 03:52:36.000]  It's a miracle it's a modern miracle no doubt about it.
[03:52:36.000 --> 03:52:38.000]  But it's complex.
[03:52:38.000 --> 03:52:40.000]  I mean to really grasp it to understand it.
[03:52:40.000 --> 03:52:49.000]  I mean hell if they take away all the philosophy in your schools and they give you to kill a mockingbird as a, you know, some some grand literary work.
[03:52:49.000 --> 03:52:56.000]  I guess you wouldn't be able to read the Bill of Rights or the Declaration of Independence or our Constitution and see the brilliance and miracle of it.
[03:52:56.000 --> 03:52:58.000]  And that's all by design.
[03:52:58.000 --> 03:53:01.000]  But before we even get to the complexity of that.
[03:53:01.000 --> 03:53:11.000]  I mean the general the general idea of freedom is I mean most general idea of freedom should at least spark something in your mind right.
[03:53:11.000 --> 03:53:22.000]  And I'm just watching how every single week there's something better to do bread and circuses and then somebody like me or Alex we say bread and circuses and and you hear it.
[03:53:22.000 --> 03:53:39.000]  And you understand it for most people in the audience most people who will call us conspiracy theories we couldn't tell them anything I could walk up to them on the street open my hand my very big hands and slap them right in the face with the word truth.
[03:53:39.000 --> 03:53:44.000]  Written across it in Sharpie and they still wouldn't be able to see it.
[03:53:44.000 --> 03:53:53.000]  But but even some of us who are in the movement we hear bread and circuses and we kind of go yeah that makes sense we're really distracted.
[03:53:53.000 --> 03:54:02.000]  But the system could not continue if we actually if we actually resigned from the distraction the way that we criticize it.
[03:54:02.000 --> 03:54:14.000]  And that's Fox News and that's sports and that's technology porn you know the list goes on.
[03:54:14.000 --> 03:54:24.000]  It I mean make no mistake about it where we are today in this country is a product and a result of our lack of righteousness and that's the only thing that's going to fix it.
[03:54:24.000 --> 03:54:39.000]  And I commend Alex Jones for being the tip of the spear on the spiritual front and saying this is a spiritual war we have to correct the spiritual side before we could have any hope or chance or or desire to fix what is broken.
[03:54:39.000 --> 03:54:54.000]  And this moral hazard goes all the way back to the beginning I know that the leftist and the Marxist and the globalist and the neoliberal neocons want to tell a prevailing story in our academic institutions that it was slavery and racism that was the original sin of this country.
[03:54:54.000 --> 03:54:56.000]  But that's not true.
[03:54:56.000 --> 03:55:04.000]  The original sin of this country was the business model that we that we brought over from the crown.
[03:55:04.000 --> 03:55:13.000]  And even furthermore, we actually played an instrumental role in the crown rebranding its business model after World War II.
[03:55:13.000 --> 03:55:15.000]  I said this before but I'll say it again.
[03:55:15.000 --> 03:55:16.000]  It's pertinent.
[03:55:16.000 --> 03:55:20.000]  They don't have any problem running Pfizer ads on you four or five, six times a day.
[03:55:20.000 --> 03:55:25.000]  You don't have any problem keeping the TV on even though you know they're brainwashing you to trust the medical industrial complex.
[03:55:25.000 --> 03:55:27.000]  So I'm going to say it again.
[03:55:27.000 --> 03:55:31.000]  The crowns business model drugs slavery piracy.
[03:55:31.000 --> 03:55:40.000]  Those are the three anchors of the crowns business model of economic imperialism and our founding fathers fought against that they resisted that.
[03:55:40.000 --> 03:55:49.000]  But after World War II, on the back of a time of great human loss and human tragedy and a genocide.
[03:55:49.000 --> 03:55:57.000]  The new narrative was the new narrative was, you know, we know what colonialism was wrong.
[03:55:57.000 --> 03:55:58.000]  You're right.
[03:55:58.000 --> 03:56:04.000]  Hey Churchill renounce your claim to the colonial empire will help you beat the Nazis.
[03:56:04.000 --> 03:56:06.000]  But it's still the Commonwealth.
[03:56:06.000 --> 03:56:08.000]  It's still the Commonwealth.
[03:56:08.000 --> 03:56:10.000]  It's still the five eyes.
[03:56:10.000 --> 03:56:11.000]  You understand what I'm saying.
[03:56:11.000 --> 03:56:15.000]  King Charles is still the lead the head monarch in Canada.
[03:56:15.000 --> 03:56:23.000]  Prince Edward of Kent is still the grand master of the Grand United Lodge there in in the UK in Great Britain.
[03:56:23.000 --> 03:56:26.000]  We're still living under Masonic rule.
[03:56:26.000 --> 03:56:33.000]  We're still living under the crown and all the other groups in there too that you want to throw in that you say are in cahoots of collaboration.
[03:56:33.000 --> 03:56:34.000]  All of that's great.
[03:56:34.000 --> 03:56:46.000]  But we're still living under slavery drugs piracy and all they're telling you now is and what they've what they've done is we're going to improve slavery.
[03:56:46.000 --> 03:56:48.000]  We're not going to make slavery racial specific.
[03:56:48.000 --> 03:56:49.000]  Why stop there?
[03:56:49.000 --> 03:56:52.000]  We're not going to make slavery chains ball and chains.
[03:56:52.000 --> 03:56:53.000]  Why?
[03:56:53.000 --> 03:56:54.000]  That's messy.
[03:56:54.000 --> 03:56:56.000]  That doesn't look good for optics.
[03:56:56.000 --> 03:57:03.000]  What we'll do is we'll enslave your mind and we'll expand it to every man woman and child of every race, nation or creed all across the planet.
[03:57:03.000 --> 03:57:07.000]  And that's what this is meant to usher in.
[03:57:07.000 --> 03:57:18.000]  The national strategy for countering domestic terrorism might as well say slavery writ large brought to you by none other than the crown.
[03:57:18.000 --> 03:57:24.000]  So where we're headed, folks, Donald Trump is the hero and these kangaroo courts, Alex Jones as well, Steve Bannon, I'm sure I'll be next.
[03:57:24.000 --> 03:57:26.000]  I'm your guest host Royce White.

[03:59:11.000 --> 03:59:15.000]  Looking back on the day I was able to ask President Donald Trump two questions.
[03:59:15.000 --> 03:59:21.000]  I was so grateful because I truly was classically trained under Alex Jones and under the info wars team.
[03:59:21.000 --> 03:59:26.000]  I really do credit that as to why I'm able to get these types of clips.
[03:59:26.000 --> 03:59:32.000]  Because Alex's whole mentality was go where the story is, go where the mainstream media refuses to.
[03:59:32.000 --> 03:59:38.000]  So it's not that I'm addicted to the insanity, I'm just addicted to telling the truth and helping the American people.
[03:59:38.000 --> 04:00:03.000]  And I really do credit Alex for you know really instilling that within me early on in my career.
