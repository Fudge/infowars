[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:17.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:17.000 --> 00:24.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.000]  Think about how incredibly disgusting this is.
[00:29.000 --> 00:35.000]  You have the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, the Queen of the Netherlands, representatives of the Queen of England,
[00:35.000 --> 00:40.000]  all of these big oil company heads, the heads of the top banks in the planet,
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  the people that have created the derivatives, the people that have bought off our politicians worldwide.
[00:45.000 --> 00:48.000]  Two years ago, they came in and openly bought off the Greek government,
[00:48.000 --> 00:51.000]  put their president in, put their finance minister in.
[00:51.000 --> 00:53.000]  You look at countries all over the world.
[00:53.000 --> 01:03.000]  Helen Saxe, J.P. Morgan, former people in the revolving door working inside the major governments as the finance ministers,
[01:03.000 --> 01:07.000]  the presidents, the prime ministers, the leaders of the senate.
[01:07.000 --> 01:11.000]  This is how they're getting away with the corruption.
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  This is how they get away with the rest of the world economy,
[01:14.000 --> 01:19.000]  melting down global depression while these mega banks make trillions of dollars
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.720]  Individuals are paid billions and billions and billions in bonuses and as the water prices are increased
[01:24.720 --> 01:26.840]  So the government can quote pay off the debts
[01:26.840 --> 01:32.360]  They don't owe in Ireland and Greece in the United States as taxes are raised everywhere
[01:32.360 --> 01:38.240]  And as the services are cut the people are told they're cutting services for austerity to pay off the debt
[01:38.240 --> 01:40.800]  But if you look at Eastern Europe you look at Latin America
[01:40.800 --> 01:46.440]  You look at Western countries that have been taken over by these people you never get out of the debt because it's impossible
[01:46.440 --> 01:52.880]  It's 1.5 quadrillion. It's fraudulent. That would have been like telling Germans in the Great Depression in
[01:54.040 --> 01:58.840]  1932 that they had to pay off every individual family's debt of
[02:00.520 --> 02:05.640]  Trillions of marks, you know, it took billions of marks to buy a a loaf of bread
[02:06.160 --> 02:09.360]  USA Today yesterday had the cover story
[02:10.160 --> 02:12.160]  That it's really
[02:12.160 --> 02:16.160]  $60 plus trillion dollars that the United States quote owes
[02:16.880 --> 02:22.040]  Well, I'm sorry last year the Washington Post reported the US share of derivatives is
[02:23.280 --> 02:30.760]  600 trillion of the 1.5 quadrillion worldwide. It's impossible to pay off. We don't owe it
[02:30.760 --> 02:33.960]  It's a fraud. We are incredibly wealthy
[02:35.120 --> 02:40.600]  But they've invested the police pension funds the fire funds the teacher funds the private funds
[02:40.600 --> 02:48.440]  Everything in these systems and now they're holding this hostage saying give us whatever we want cut all your benefits
[02:48.440 --> 02:49.920]  Or you'll get nothing
[02:49.920 --> 02:54.760]  That's the trick and then we do that three years ago things get worse now
[02:54.760 --> 03:02.600]  They're back saying more bailouts more money more unlimited trillions to Europe or Greece will collapse and take Europe with it
[03:02.600 --> 03:05.280]  It won't take Greece and Europe with it and then America
[03:05.280 --> 03:12.080]  It will take the bankers with it and you watch they're gonna have trillions more in quote bailouts that are really just blood money
[03:12.080 --> 03:17.720]  Pay to these criminals and they'll be back in a couple more years for more more more and the deeper the depression gets
[03:17.720 --> 03:21.880]  They'll say cut cut cut cut cut cut cut pay us everything and we'll fix it
[03:21.880 --> 03:25.880]  Then you cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut pay them everything and only gets worse
[03:26.560 --> 03:28.560]  And here's Obama
[03:28.720 --> 03:32.400]  And we told you a week ago this was gonna happen that at Bilderberg
[03:32.400 --> 03:38.700]  They were going to get trillions more and Obama is pressing the Germans and others to to bail out
[03:38.700 --> 03:40.700]  it's not a bailout to give
[03:40.720 --> 03:47.600]  Trillions more including US taxpayer money and German and French and other money to quote save Greece or it'll pull down Europe
[03:47.600 --> 03:51.120]  The debt over 90% of it is created by the bankers
[03:51.120 --> 03:55.440]  They just get government to sign on to the debt and promise to bail it out
[03:55.440 --> 03:58.200]  Then they turn around and say this is your debt
[03:58.200 --> 04:04.320]  You've got to pay it and we're gonna cut your pension fund. We're gonna cut your social security that you paid into now
[04:04.320 --> 04:06.320]  I'm not a fan of people being
[04:06.920 --> 04:13.160]  Dependent I'm not a fan of the socialist model because I know it was created by the bankers on record to get you dependent
[04:13.160 --> 04:18.680]  So they could then hold you hostage and control the entire system and have everything under federal
[04:19.200 --> 04:24.920]  Systems that tie into the world government, but here's Obama and we told you this was coming Obama presses Europe
[04:24.920 --> 04:30.480]  pledges help for Greek crisis. They've already had three rounds of bailouts there
[04:31.040 --> 04:36.840]  Greece has lost its credit rating just like Moody's a standard and poor says the US is so it's more more more the more
[04:36.840 --> 04:43.280]  You pay the bankers the more you owe them because when our countries create a dollar to bail someone out a dollar of debt
[04:43.280 --> 04:48.120]  Is created to the very bankers that we're bailing out. It's like a snake eating its tail
[04:48.320 --> 04:54.080]  The fraud is so huge and so simple it makes it complex and people can't see it. It's us or them
[04:54.080 --> 04:59.000]  It's us or them ladies and gentlemen. We're coming back with more coverage. Stay with us
[04:59.640 --> 05:06.520]  You've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions
[05:06.800 --> 05:14.320]  Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the silver lung system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body
[05:15.080 --> 05:19.120]  My name is Mario Sephalde and I'm the developer of the silver lungs generator
[05:19.120 --> 05:24.200]  Not only does the silver lung system produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions
[05:24.200 --> 05:32.120]  It also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas
[05:32.520 --> 05:36.480]  This includes the eyes ears nose lungs
[05:37.000 --> 05:40.240]  Topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system
[05:40.480 --> 05:44.240]  Be sure to watch our new seven-minute video tour of the silver lung system at
[05:44.240 --> 05:50.720]  www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the silver lung system works as
[05:51.080 --> 05:55.300]  Well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's

[05:59.480 --> 06:07.400]  The Genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[06:07.400 --> 06:12.160]  This has been the biggest year ever
[06:12.720 --> 06:16.760]  In the 35 years that the Bilderberg group has been exposed
[06:16.760 --> 06:22.320]  They've been meeting of course for decades before that their own corporate minutes have been ferreted out since then
[06:22.320 --> 06:27.840]  They've even released some of them to the BBC a decade ago admitting they want to set up world government
[06:27.840 --> 06:35.080]  But US media until just a few years ago was still saying it did not exist and that you are insane if you talk about it
[06:35.080 --> 06:38.440]  That's why I get countless emails of people talking about their family members
[06:38.440 --> 06:43.320]  If they talk about it at dinner visiting their parents or their children or their neighbors they are laughed at
[06:43.960 --> 06:51.280]  Because the average of my numb person out there thinks they're on the winning team if they laugh at people that have more knowledge than them
[06:51.280 --> 06:53.280]  We now have the full
[06:53.280 --> 06:54.160]  2011
[06:54.160 --> 06:57.640]  Official attendee list. It is bombshell. We'll be breaking it down
[06:57.680 --> 07:03.480]  It's up at info wars.com and prison planet.com drudge is also linked to it drudge report.com
[07:03.480 --> 07:09.840]  Also, Paul Joseph Watson. There's a video on the site breaks down the official Bilderberg
[07:10.840 --> 07:13.240]  2011 attendee list
[07:14.440 --> 07:21.800]  Bilderberg behind Rick Perry 2012 run that report is up on the site also with the news that Newt Gennrich's
[07:22.120 --> 07:24.320]  staff is quitting and going to the
[07:25.320 --> 07:27.320]  globalist Perry because
[07:27.680 --> 07:29.760]  Gennrich is falling out of favor with the
[07:29.760 --> 07:33.600]  Ruling class because he's losing so much traction
[07:33.600 --> 07:40.000]  We've got a lot of key economic and military news today coming up China's raiding house says US is already
[07:40.720 --> 07:47.680]  Defaulting as I've told you for years. We're going to explain what that means to everyone hyperinflation and the death of the dollar
[07:47.760 --> 07:49.440]  It's all coming up today
[07:49.440 --> 07:56.280]  But I take you now to Paul Watson in st. Mort's Switzerland the site of Bilderberg 2011 with a lot of big developments
[07:56.280 --> 07:58.280]  He's also with we are change
[07:58.280 --> 08:05.360]  Out of Switzerland and we are change founder Luke Radowski also RT reporter and info wars.com
[08:06.040 --> 08:12.560]  Roving reporter with some big breaking news on the staged bomb threat that even the Guardian is reporting. It was staged
[08:12.800 --> 08:18.080]  We of course first broke that news here yesterday because our team is is working so hard doing such a great job
[08:18.320 --> 08:22.480]  And we go down to Paul Joseph Watson with a report on the latest developments
[08:22.480 --> 08:28.360]  Then he'll hand the phone off to Luke Radowski of we are change Paul break down the latest developments
[08:29.600 --> 08:36.400]  Hi Alex. Yeah, we're an event that's just up the hill from the Bilderberg hotel about an hour ago
[08:36.400 --> 08:40.240]  We actually went in the field. That's just above the hotel
[08:40.680 --> 08:44.720]  Just outside the police line and we were able to film live footage
[08:44.720 --> 08:50.640]  Which was streamed on just in TV of the helicopter picking up one of the Bilderberg members
[08:50.640 --> 08:52.640]  We believe it to be a woman
[08:53.080 --> 08:59.160]  And it flew off over the mountains. So we got some pretty good live footage and then afterwards we were interviewing
[09:00.120 --> 09:02.120]  Dominique we are change Switzerland
[09:02.280 --> 09:08.640]  And he was telling us about a big breaking story involving the Swiss politician
[09:09.040 --> 09:15.920]  Dominique Baitig who before the conference had called for Henry Kissinger to be arrested as a war criminal
[09:15.920 --> 09:23.280]  And I'm going to hand you over to Dominique so he can explain the letter that has now been presented to the Swiss
[09:23.280 --> 09:28.000]  Okay, and tell us who Dominique is again to tell us who Dominique is before you give him the phone
[09:28.280 --> 09:30.800]  Dominique is from we are change Switzerland
[09:31.440 --> 09:33.860]  Okay, Dominique good to speak with you, sir
[09:34.640 --> 09:36.640]  Give us a report
[09:37.480 --> 09:39.480]  Okay yesterday
[09:39.480 --> 09:46.520]  We went to the hotel the Bilderberg hotel where they meet and we brought a letter from the Swiss legislature
[09:47.040 --> 09:49.880]  Dominique Baitig who was stated that
[09:50.480 --> 09:59.080]  The different journalists were intimidated by the police them. They were followed by cars with the German numbers in Switzerland and
[10:01.280 --> 10:04.240]  Black black windows and things like that. So
[10:04.240 --> 10:10.880]  Baitig wrote an official letter that we handed out to the chief of the region Barbara Janom Steiner
[10:11.400 --> 10:13.400]  to get sure that the
[10:13.960 --> 10:20.240]  Journalists can do their work and that the coverage is done about the Bilderberg because he know what the
[10:20.360 --> 10:25.800]  What the agenda is from the Bilderberg is and he doesn't want them to meet in Switzerland
[10:25.800 --> 10:30.120]  They should go away. He said and tonight he will come to confront the
[10:31.440 --> 10:33.440]  event managers about
[10:33.440 --> 10:34.600]  the
[10:34.600 --> 10:39.040]  Case that Henry Kissinger is coming to Switzerland. This is big news, sir
[10:39.040 --> 10:46.200]  And then again, you've already had a member of the equivalent of your Congress come out earlier in the week and call for
[10:46.960 --> 10:48.320]  the
[10:48.320 --> 10:56.440]  Arrest of Kissinger. Is this the same now explain your government system explain your government system and in exactly who he is in his name again and
[10:57.320 --> 11:00.920]  Who's talked to him? It sounds like you've talked to him. You have the official letter
[11:00.920 --> 11:05.520]  He's already in the papers saying he wants Kissinger arrested. You're saying he is coming today
[11:06.200 --> 11:08.200]  to confront the police
[11:08.960 --> 11:13.400]  It's not the only one. They are two other legislators coming up there in the
[11:13.800 --> 11:19.960]  Hotel randlings where we stay at an event that they talk about the Bilderberg meetings and their agenda and so
[11:21.040 --> 11:23.040]  We have in Switzerland
[11:23.160 --> 11:27.680]  subsidiary subsidiary system. So the people the local people can do
[11:27.680 --> 11:33.960]  Uh politics and then it's go up and up to the to the to the federal
[11:34.480 --> 11:40.760]  System, so it's not a centralized system where in the central laws are being being a
[11:44.240 --> 11:50.160]  Yes, sir for those that don't know the United States more than the Greeks and Romans as we were told by modern historians
[11:50.320 --> 11:54.680]  The United States if you read the founding fathers was actually founded off a Dutch model
[11:54.680 --> 12:01.560]  That was then exported to Switzerland Switzerland already had a similar model where you actually have your your states
[12:02.080 --> 12:05.920]  Of course under another name. You have your what cantons, correct?
[12:08.720 --> 12:13.320]  Yes, you have your you have your states for those that don't know and they are the supreme power
[12:13.520 --> 12:20.800]  They then vote and completely order the vassal federal body around as our republic was established
[12:20.800 --> 12:25.920]  We now have it completely backwards here in the United States and that's why we're in so much trouble
[12:25.920 --> 12:30.720]  And so some of the leaders of the states hence leaders of the federal government
[12:31.360 --> 12:35.420]  Because the states run your federal government are coming. You're saying three of them
[12:35.440 --> 12:39.760]  We do have the mainstream Swiss papers from two days ago where he was saying he wants them arrested
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.220]  Yeah, your prime minister has said they shouldn't be meeting there as well. So what you're saying is confirmed there
[12:44.220 --> 12:46.320]  But this is big breaking news
[12:46.320 --> 12:51.400]  This is the first time I've ever heard of this that the leaders of a government are going to be going and
[12:52.480 --> 12:56.040]  Confronting the criminals that are meeting there any other details you can give us sir
[12:58.400 --> 13:01.540]  Other things is that that's it the national
[13:02.040 --> 13:07.680]  Legislature said that if something's gonna happen if blood is on the street the whole
[13:08.160 --> 13:11.920]  Responsibility has to be taken by the chief of the region
[13:11.920 --> 13:18.480]  We're also attending at the Bilderberg meeting, but it states that stop all the
[13:19.560 --> 13:21.960]  scaring of the journalist and let them
[13:22.920 --> 13:28.880]  Get the work out and do the big coverage of the Bilderberg meeting because in this
[13:29.480 --> 13:36.880]  Country like Switzerland if we have been direct democracy the people should be informed about this meeting and that we have an article
[13:37.400 --> 13:39.040]  article
[13:39.040 --> 13:41.040]  266 that
[13:41.040 --> 13:46.000]  States that our politicians cannot meet in secret with other
[13:47.200 --> 13:52.640]  Politicians from other states other countries foreign countries. Yeah, it's called trees. Oh, we have the Logan as well
[13:53.520 --> 14:00.440]  This is like the Logan at here. Yeah. Yeah, so it's an illegal thing and he
[14:00.960 --> 14:03.480]  repeated this that he don't want to be a
[14:04.400 --> 14:09.480]  Part of this system where the Bilderberg can get a platform in this country
[14:09.480 --> 14:11.480]  So
[14:11.520 --> 14:17.080]  Well amazing sir now now to be specific you're with we are changed Luke Radowski is there as well
[14:17.600 --> 14:21.120]  Paul Watson is with you, but you've seen the letter. I mean, how do you know the lever?
[14:21.840 --> 14:23.520]  Have you seen the letter?
[14:23.520 --> 14:27.200]  Yes, I wrote a letter to the legislature in Switzerland
[14:27.200 --> 14:34.600]  You can reach your legislatures wrote them letters and if you know them if you're going outside to meet them talk with them
[14:34.600 --> 14:40.280]  They are they're trying to help you and there's a few politicians who have the balls to help you well, sir
[14:40.280 --> 14:41.160]  You're amazing
[14:41.160 --> 14:47.880]  You're amazing give us your full name because you you deserve great credit doing the right thing and going to your representatives your servants
[14:48.240 --> 14:54.280]  Your your legged so the people that serve you your representative and getting them to do the right thing
[14:54.280 --> 14:57.000]  This is going to be very very historical and obviously
[14:57.600 --> 15:02.920]  We've got to have our team there covering it and we'll have our team there covering it and more on that live in the third hour
[15:02.920 --> 15:08.760]  I literally with their cell phones as this happens at the gates of Bilderberg, but specifically give us your full name, sir
[15:16.400 --> 15:21.400]  And I wonder if the police are going to try to keep their boss from delivering this letter
[15:23.120 --> 15:25.520]  I think it's a Swiss police
[15:25.520 --> 15:32.000]  Are very patriotic some of them even are and they didn't know what they are what they are?
[15:33.760 --> 15:39.760]  Protecting we we have to inform them about the attendees and about the whole Bilderberg meeting who was
[15:40.720 --> 15:42.720]  who was
[15:42.720 --> 15:54.880]  Was filled up by and not see Prince Bernhardt
[15:59.680 --> 16:06.280]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation
[16:06.400 --> 16:12.440]  Could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power
[16:12.440 --> 16:20.080]  Your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[16:20.120 --> 16:28.520]  Number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[16:28.520 --> 16:35.240]  Number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[16:35.240 --> 16:42.880]  Donages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks. I really believe in the solar power generators

[22:00.920 --> 22:04.040]  This has got to happen now. This is huge breaking news with the
[22:04.640 --> 22:05.720]  big
[22:05.720 --> 22:10.800]  Demonstration at high noon. I know there's a lot more people there today, but we're less than 24 hours
[22:10.800 --> 22:17.640]  We're like 18 hours or something now out from the big demonstration at high noon tomorrow there in Saint Moritz Watson
[22:17.640 --> 22:21.640]  Any other points to add? I mean that was bombshell information that we just
[22:21.640 --> 22:23.640]  Received right there
[22:24.800 --> 22:25.800]  Yeah
[22:25.800 --> 22:29.240]  We're gonna we're gonna have to stay up here and film it and I guess
[22:29.920 --> 22:31.920]  You're gonna write the article is that what's happening?
[22:32.320 --> 22:36.800]  Yeah, and we've got it with the Swiss get a hold of that office and make sure exactly when he's arriving
[22:36.800 --> 22:42.160]  We've got to get that on tape and march with him up there because if he doesn't have people backing him
[22:43.360 --> 22:46.080]  Who knows what they'll do to him and again?
[22:46.080 --> 22:52.400]  This is an equivalent of Ron Paul marching Swiss Ron Paul literally marching up to Bilderberg. This this is
[22:53.840 --> 22:55.680]  Sensational it is
[22:55.680 --> 23:02.200]  Sensational the amount of attention this is going to draw to the real shadow enemies once we identify these vampires in the light of
[23:02.200 --> 23:04.680]  High noon today and tomorrow. This is another
[23:05.520 --> 23:10.200]  Devastating blow as we show people that there are little men behind the curtain. They're not the great Oz
[23:10.200 --> 23:12.200]  They're not invincible. What is happening is?
[23:12.200 --> 23:16.000]  Historical to say the least if you just joined us
[23:16.520 --> 23:21.920]  Three Swiss ministers have signed a letter. It has been delivered to the Bilderberg group
[23:21.920 --> 23:28.840]  The police have now backed off harassing media and one of their highest level members of their slash Congress
[23:29.760 --> 23:36.780]  It's called their canton. It's the Council of the States is going to go to Bilderberg and demand to be let in and is going to
[23:36.780 --> 23:45.100]  Confront and try to have Henry Kissinger arrested. This is off the charts delicious. I know we can beat the globalist
[23:45.100 --> 23:50.080]  I know that who has the fight wins who is in the right wins when they fight
[23:51.020 --> 23:53.020]  resistance is victory
[23:53.760 --> 23:59.500]  My children's future your children's future free humanity the spirit of 1776
[23:59.740 --> 24:04.780]  Everything we are is about standing up and marching on Bilderberg today and tomorrow
[24:04.780 --> 24:11.640]  This is off the chart exciting and I take you now. I believe we've gotten him online to mark Anderson
[24:12.500 --> 24:14.140]  he is
[24:14.140 --> 24:19.100]  one of the chief reporters I believe he's even the editor over there at American Free Press and
[24:19.340 --> 24:24.580]  He writes on news across the nation American Free Press net the colleague of Jim Tucker and
[24:26.100 --> 24:33.020]  Mr. Anderson, it's good to have you there. Are you as energized and excited as I am about these bombshell developments?
[24:33.020 --> 24:38.700]  Absolutely, and you know, it's kind of a mixture of activists and Sherlock Holmes
[24:38.700 --> 24:45.980]  You know the the Bilderbergers are an intrigue kind of group and you you have to be a kind of a flute and an activist at the same
[24:45.980 --> 24:47.980]  time, but I'm very excited
[24:48.540 --> 24:54.860]  What do you make of the fact that this letter has been delivered the cops have suddenly begun to really behave themselves and are having
[24:54.860 --> 24:58.020]  the reporters get closer because you know there it's direct
[24:58.020 --> 25:03.180]  You democracy and their their boss has told them you're protecting criminals
[25:03.500 --> 25:09.540]  We're told the police are really starting to wake up and now this member of the government this member
[25:10.540 --> 25:17.620]  Cantonian leader is is going to be arriving soon to try to get into Bilderberg. This is Bilderberg under siege mark
[25:19.500 --> 25:24.900]  Absolutely, I think we're talking about Dominique Baytick the National Council member of the Swiss People's Party. Yes
[25:24.900 --> 25:31.380]  Yeah, Dominique as you probably know had written letters to Simonetta Samaruga the federal
[25:31.980 --> 25:35.740]  civil law enforcement officer who's a member of the federal council and then
[25:36.060 --> 25:41.820]  Mrs. Barbara Genome Steiner and she's the cantonal cop top top officer and
[25:42.180 --> 25:46.220]  Not only did they not initially respond to Baytick, but Genome Steiner
[25:46.540 --> 25:48.540]  She actually is attending Bilderberg
[25:48.540 --> 25:56.620]  So initially there was a slap in the face to Dominique Baytick in his initial letters fleeing to these top law enforcement officers
[25:56.620 --> 26:01.460]  Not to even allow Bilderberg to meet here in the first place. So they they they snubbed
[26:02.900 --> 26:04.660]  Dominique Baytick this
[26:04.660 --> 26:09.500]  traditionalist minded legislator, but what we're hearing now, which is what you're talking about
[26:09.780 --> 26:18.140]  He's not taking this lying down and he's going to ignore their their cold shoulder and and evidently be very proactive about this
[26:18.140 --> 26:20.140]  So that that takes a lot of courage a
[26:20.860 --> 26:24.100]  Great deal of courage on Dominique's part mark. I know you are
[26:25.620 --> 26:30.620]  You know really second only to somebody like Jim Tucker in your deep years of research and following
[26:31.380 --> 26:33.700]  Bilderberg and you've been to many of these events
[26:33.980 --> 26:41.340]  Am I right in saying that nothing like this has ever happened and that that that this is a major
[26:42.260 --> 26:43.220]  watershed
[26:43.220 --> 26:44.980]  bellwether
[26:44.980 --> 26:51.860]  Flashpoint event I believe so in many ways Jim Jim and I were discussing this earlier
[26:52.460 --> 26:56.780]  First of all, he cannot remember. He goes back like 35 years
[26:56.780 --> 27:04.900]  He cannot remember ever there being a national legislator of a host country to Bilderberg raising this kind of ruckus in this manner
[27:05.780 --> 27:12.820]  Actually trying to prevent Bilderberg from meeting and when he couldn't do that then going to this next step and delivering this this protest
[27:12.820 --> 27:15.540]  Apparently in in person in front of Bilderberg
[27:15.660 --> 27:22.580]  So this is unprecedented and according to Jim who just told me this this morning and he's been covering this for 35 years
[27:24.340 --> 27:26.980]  And then then you have the other factors involved there
[27:26.980 --> 27:33.580]  They're taking this this meeting taking place in a country whose traditions run exactly against the grain of Bilderberg
[27:33.700 --> 27:40.420]  They want centralized control the Swiss believe in a kind of a populist home rule grassroots style of government
[27:40.420 --> 27:44.180]  It's just a no fit all the way. They shouldn't be here
[27:44.740 --> 27:48.340]  Philosophically culturally in in for any reason they don't belong here
[27:48.420 --> 27:51.660]  They don't belong anywhere really but they definitely don't belong here
[27:51.660 --> 27:55.660]  And I think that's what they take these that this would tarnish the Swiss system
[27:55.660 --> 28:01.820]  It would tarnish their reputation and he probably suspects that that some of their deliberations might be how to get
[28:01.980 --> 28:07.140]  Switzerland into the European Union, so it's not the sticky wicket in the in their
[28:07.140 --> 28:13.060]  Mad quest for a unified Europe and notice as soon as they have the second vote and finally force
[28:13.620 --> 28:19.260]  The success story Ireland into the EU they immediately by design through the ministers
[28:19.260 --> 28:27.020]  They controlled the traders inside Ireland economically imploded them and handed literally the lion's share of their taxes over to the IMF and World Bank
[28:27.020 --> 28:28.820]  And that's what they want to do to Switzerland
[28:28.820 --> 28:35.260]  And so the you know the hour is getting late that the global crisis is on the crimes of Bilderberg are known and
[28:35.260 --> 28:43.740]  People are identifying them as the enemy as people like yourself and the protesters continually to doggedly expose Bilderberg being laughed at
[28:43.740 --> 28:49.660]  They've been told it doesn't exist ha ha ha now we see it all coming to a head as the global

[32:55.300 --> 33:07.940]  Coast to coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[33:15.260 --> 33:22.180]  Agents that literally carry the spark of God's love in their hearts for their children in our cultures are everywhere and
[33:22.180 --> 33:29.980]  The globalists have their legions of paid-off scum and psychopaths and sociopaths and bullies and control freaks
[33:30.300 --> 33:37.260]  But it's always pre-humanity that isn't rallied until things get really bad and then good people finally come out of their trance
[33:37.260 --> 33:41.620]  Wake up and and that's why the evil ones are so scared of good people because
[33:42.060 --> 33:47.940]  They want to intimidate us and make us feel weak because they can literally at a spiritual instinctive level
[33:47.940 --> 33:54.220]  We are like thousand-foot giants to them because we're in the right and and the wicked flee when none pursue and
[33:54.540 --> 33:58.340]  Well, we are pursuing and that's why they flee and hide Mark Anderson
[33:59.420 --> 34:04.580]  Yeah, you know, I think that for all their great wealth. They're the poorest people on the planet
[34:04.580 --> 34:10.500]  They're culturally and in their soul in their intellect in their spirit
[34:10.580 --> 34:15.780]  They're they're poorer than dirt and I think they know that all they have is money and power
[34:15.780 --> 34:18.980]  They're which are ephemeral things things that slip away
[34:18.980 --> 34:24.340]  I think they sense their own mortality individually and collectively that there's nowhere to run
[34:24.340 --> 34:27.420]  There's nowhere to hide. They're not going to get away with this because we're not going to let them
[34:27.420 --> 34:33.220]  It's just that simple and you know, even if they were meeting for the best of reasons and everything was
[34:33.700 --> 34:37.500]  Peaches and cream you still not supposed to have secret decisions being made
[34:37.500 --> 34:40.540]  See, that's what people don't understand secrets is never good
[34:40.540 --> 34:46.020]  Even if the best intentions are there and we know they don't have the best intentions. So it's a double whammy
[34:46.660 --> 34:51.300]  You know, it's just there's no way they can explain their way out of this. It's undemocratic. It's wrong
[34:51.500 --> 34:55.580]  Even if they're voting to send money to the poor every week, they need to do it in the open
[34:55.700 --> 35:02.460]  But you know openness to them is you know, just an asthma. They they don't even understand what that's about, you know
[35:03.460 --> 35:05.460]  It's just
[35:05.460 --> 35:11.060]  It's it's it's almost bad. I mean, they're they're really I pity them as much as I load them
[35:13.540 --> 35:20.580]  Well, you're right a mark Anderson looking at the agenda for folks that just joined us we're covering a Bilderberg 2011 a day that will
[35:21.020 --> 35:25.020]  Be remembered for a long time a very exciting
[35:25.020 --> 35:29.060]  You know the equivalent of a run Paul of Switzerland. That's what he's known as
[35:30.380 --> 35:32.380]  You're heading up one of the cantons
[35:32.380 --> 35:39.820]  And again their states then combined to make the federal government it's direct state rule people rule what the republic once had through the states
[35:40.500 --> 35:46.060]  Until the globalist took over in 1913 and got rid of the 17th amendment for the states to send in the US senators
[35:46.100 --> 35:49.780]  He's basically the equivalent of that for folks that don't understand the US
[35:50.260 --> 35:52.260]  Republic before it was taken over and
[35:52.580 --> 35:55.780]  Understand the Swiss system but expanding on that mark
[35:56.500 --> 36:00.340]  Recapping how big this is we're gonna put them when we can the letter back on screen
[36:00.340 --> 36:07.260]  That's been delivered by Luke Radowski and later today in the next few hours the leader of this canton is gonna come there
[36:07.260 --> 36:12.860]  He's already sent out to the prosecutors the police. He's told him look you're in violation of law. I'm coming
[36:12.860 --> 36:18.180]  I'm your boss look out. This is a showdown. This is a showdown. This is big
[36:19.860 --> 36:27.300]  It's major it's it's you know heartening to see and this is the right country for it to happen in they don't belong here
[36:27.300 --> 36:31.020]  As I said, it's retrograde to what they believe and you know
[36:31.020 --> 36:35.060]  They're what they're in the wrong environment and in it and it provides the right opportunity
[36:35.660 --> 36:38.500]  To present them with the right rebuke the right
[36:39.220 --> 36:44.180]  Defense of the common man and it's time for the common man to win a few
[36:44.180 --> 36:47.500]  You know, they they've had their day in the sun. It's time for them to pack it in
[36:48.300 --> 36:51.780]  Any other key points you'd like to add about what you've observed editor
[36:51.780 --> 36:58.180]  I know you work as a visiting editor in a lot of things. In fact, what is your title in American Free Press? I know you're radio talk shows too
[36:58.180 --> 37:00.500]  I've never seen you many times mark. What's your time over there?
[37:01.140 --> 37:09.220]  I'm editor Jim is at Jim Tucker's editor emeritus. He's semi-retired, but he still covers Bilderberg and I'm editor and we're a team now
[37:09.220 --> 37:12.260]  I'm sort of inheriting the baton from him more or less and
[37:13.420 --> 37:20.180]  Well, I think that what we're talking about today are that is the key development and what I talked about earlier where the
[37:20.180 --> 37:25.940]  Legislator who's rebuking and confronting Bilderberg tried to get the local
[37:26.340 --> 37:30.540]  Local and federal police from stopping Bilderberg from meeting here in the first place
[37:30.540 --> 37:36.500]  But maybe it's almost better that didn't happen because if that didn't happen or if that would have happened had they not met here
[37:36.500 --> 37:38.140]  then we he wouldn't be
[37:38.140 --> 37:44.980]  evidently approaching them and you know confronting them with this letter, so maybe this is the way God intended it, you know and
[37:44.980 --> 37:52.180]  And certainly I think that these specific issues that Bilderberg wants to discuss include
[37:52.820 --> 37:59.220]  Whether to continue the wars in Afghanistan and Libya it always includes energy matters monetary matters
[37:59.820 --> 38:01.820]  You know will be
[38:02.300 --> 38:05.460]  I'm sure that meeting in Switzerland. They're they're gonna think about
[38:06.260 --> 38:07.860]  Switzerland being this
[38:07.860 --> 38:11.740]  You know odd man out and not not fitting into their global straitjacket
[38:11.740 --> 38:19.180]  You know everything everything is a lot less secret about Bilderberg than it used to be but it's still hard to discern of course
[38:19.180 --> 38:26.100]  Unless you're in there exactly what they're talking about, you know, they do have a quasi official website where they list a
[38:26.980 --> 38:31.340]  quasi official set of topics, but you know, they're they're very misleading
[38:31.340 --> 38:35.580]  There's one in there right now on their official website something like Switzerland
[38:36.380 --> 38:39.380]  You know, will it be successful in the future?
[38:39.380 --> 38:45.260]  You know, you could read that a lot of different ways, you know, real innocuous sounding topics and so
[38:45.700 --> 38:50.860]  It always sounds dry and and academic, you know, if you read their own literature
[38:51.340 --> 38:56.140]  But of course, there's much more to it and the secrecy is the enduring problem. So
[38:58.460 --> 39:04.740]  That's essentially what we've got so far and the rest is just a lot of legwork confirming who's there
[39:05.220 --> 39:07.220]  Okay, how well
[39:07.220 --> 39:09.860]  Let's there yeah, Mark Anderson. We've got
[39:11.420 --> 39:14.300]  Jim Tucker on the line with us. We're gonna let you go
[39:15.140 --> 39:20.620]  But stay close to my guys because I want to get you to pop in coming up later in the broadcast
[39:20.620 --> 39:24.740]  But Mark, thank you so much. We'll continue to watch your work in American Free Press.net. Thank you, sir
[39:27.860 --> 39:29.220]  Okay, thank you, sir
[39:29.220 --> 39:34.200]  Here is Jim Tucker the original Bilderberg sleuth Jim good to have you here with us
[39:34.200 --> 39:41.800]  It's always a pleasure Jim. How big is this that this top swish leader has sent the letter
[39:43.760 --> 39:47.880]  Demanding that Kissinger basically be arrested and that the police follow
[39:48.320 --> 39:52.520]  The Swiss Constitution and honor the press and that he is now in the next few hours
[39:53.040 --> 39:57.600]  Preparing to make his way there to try to basically force his way into the Bilderberg group meeting
[39:57.600 --> 40:02.680]  Well, the several people's
[40:04.680 --> 40:06.680]  Such as
[40:06.880 --> 40:08.400]  Vehicle approach
[40:08.400 --> 40:12.760]  On the other hand, there's several ways they've been done. They couldn't take it in the ambulance
[40:13.960 --> 40:18.960]  From the airplane to the car park somewhere else is slide in that way
[40:19.560 --> 40:21.560]  But Kissinger is definitely there
[40:21.560 --> 40:27.160]  Yes, now he's the heart of Bilderberg along with Rockefeller and Queen Beatrix
[40:27.160 --> 40:32.080]  Well, what do you make of the announcement that that this that this leader of a canton?
[40:32.080 --> 40:39.880]  I mean as high level as it gets other than the Prime Minister of Switzerland is going to confront them Jim. Have you heard this news?
[40:41.600 --> 40:45.040]  Yes, Eric, the guy's been reported. He has a confrontation and
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  It should be a lot of fun, too. I
[40:49.000 --> 40:55.880]  Guess you'll have to step outside the gates until we they come out because I've had it
[40:56.440 --> 40:58.440]  filled up inside
[40:58.640 --> 41:00.640]  as they could
[41:00.640 --> 41:02.480]  through the jail at the
[41:02.480 --> 41:04.480]  Bucks be lined
[41:04.480 --> 41:08.080]  In fact, they have killed a couple of people already and tried to walk through
[41:08.600 --> 41:12.680]  Against orders took one guy's passport away. They're playing rough
[41:13.480 --> 41:15.480]  But in Switzerland though
[41:15.480 --> 41:23.840]  These canton leaders, I mean it that'd be like speaker of the house or that'd be like Ron Paul
[41:24.040 --> 41:28.160]  And you know showing up at a Bilderberg group meeting in Chantilly and demanding to be let in
[41:29.800 --> 41:31.800]  Yes, it'd be analogous to that
[41:33.800 --> 41:38.880]  This is huge have you ever seen anything like this in your 35 years of covering the Bilderberg scum?
[41:39.600 --> 41:42.280]  Never never has to have space and
[41:42.280 --> 41:46.520]  so publicly challenged Bilderberg I
[41:48.400 --> 41:50.400]  Tell you this is they
[41:50.720 --> 41:53.880]  If they were running scared earlier in the week jam
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.680]  You know, they've heard of this. Do you think they're doing you know what in their in their underwear? Oh
[42:00.600 --> 42:02.600]  Yes, I'm sure they have bowel problems
[42:05.120 --> 42:07.120]  Starting lady way because we
[42:07.120 --> 42:11.880]  All of them count proud cover keeping the helicopters away and
[42:14.120 --> 42:16.120]  Not only the helicopters get to
[42:18.600 --> 42:23.920]  St. Marie so they had to love long distance driving and
[42:25.440 --> 42:29.000]  Some planes were able to land in the small airport later
[42:30.720 --> 42:33.040]  But they were a whole day late getting started
[42:33.040 --> 42:39.640]  And they all have three ducking not on Monday because they're cover meetings
[42:42.480 --> 42:46.680]  You know, it was this one cover meeting as you know and that way the
[42:47.400 --> 42:51.040]  Secretary defense can duck into Bilderberg and they go home
[42:51.040 --> 42:56.280]  But the reason he is over here was NATO and no word mention about the Bilderberg meeting, of course
[42:56.280 --> 43:01.200]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone
[43:01.200 --> 43:06.080]  This is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[43:06.800 --> 43:09.560]  They'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[43:09.560 --> 43:15.280]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots
[43:15.280 --> 43:22.760]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the Republican Party
[43:22.760 --> 43:30.320]  As American citizens to pay attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel
[43:30.400 --> 43:37.480]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[43:37.480 --> 43:43.520]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care
[43:43.520 --> 43:45.520]  And right now in Washington DC
[43:45.520 --> 43:53.680]  We have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars calm

[44:22.400 --> 44:29.960]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous

[47:09.760 --> 47:15.080]  The Genesis communications radio network probably presents the Alex Jones show
[47:15.080 --> 47:17.680]  Because there's a war on for your mind
[47:23.760 --> 47:25.760]  Well, this is an historical broadcast
[47:26.360 --> 47:33.400]  We're talking to a member of the Swiss parliament right now Lucas Reiman other members of the parliament
[47:33.640 --> 47:35.640]  Are soon to arrive
[47:36.600 --> 47:42.840]  This is just incredible and we're talking about the different party leaders that are arriving who stand against the globalist the IMF
[47:42.840 --> 47:45.400]  The World Bank takeovers of their sovereignty
[47:46.120 --> 47:53.240]  These prominent members are preparing they've already delivered the letter through Luke Radowski to then attempt to go to the police that work for them
[47:53.280 --> 47:59.240]  They've written letters to the police saying Kissinger is a war criminal. He needs to be arrested. They've written letters to the prosecutors and
[48:00.120 --> 48:04.480]  One of the parliamentary leaders that's about to arrive has said he is going to march up there
[48:05.880 --> 48:07.880]  Continuing with that
[48:08.320 --> 48:10.320]  Member of Parliament Reiman
[48:10.320 --> 48:16.880]  Specifically, do you know when you're going to march up to Bilderberg and what minister Dominic is planning?
[48:20.040 --> 48:23.880]  I'm very sorry, I couldn't understand you today. I'm here already
[48:25.320 --> 48:27.560]  Talking, okay, I understand sir
[48:28.520 --> 48:31.880]  Tell us why you guys oppose the Bilderberg group
[48:31.880 --> 48:42.680]  Yeah, we oppose the Bilderberg group because we think in a democracy people should decide, you know, in Switzerland people can decide about every decision by vote
[48:42.680 --> 48:47.480]  People vote, yes or no and not a few people
[48:47.480 --> 48:55.960]  The most rich people, the most important people they can decide about the people. We think it should come from the people
[48:55.960 --> 49:01.280]  We want freedom for the people and not the Bilderbergs
[49:02.560 --> 49:06.800]  Now before I went to break you were talking about opposing the IMF World Bank
[49:06.800 --> 49:13.320]  Can you explain to people what those systems are doing, what the euro is doing and why the Swiss are standing against it?
[49:16.600 --> 49:20.400]  Yeah, we did a lot of work in the parliament against the IMF
[49:20.400 --> 49:26.320]  You know, Switzerland is not a member of the European Union. It's not a member of the euro
[49:26.320 --> 49:33.920]  We also tried to get out Switzerland of the IMF to stop this system that wants to
[49:33.920 --> 49:41.120]  It's a slavery of the currencies and we have to stop that. We want freedom also for the currencies
[49:41.120 --> 49:51.560]  What can you tell us about the plans that we've been told of today for the man you called your leader?
[49:51.560 --> 49:56.360]  Please again tell us about his position in Swiss government in the parliament
[49:56.360 --> 50:03.480]  Who's coming and who wrote the letter and is planning reportedly to go and march up to the gates of Bilderberg
[50:03.480 --> 50:06.200]  And reportedly demand to be let in
[50:06.200 --> 50:09.680]  He tried to stop the bill
[50:09.680 --> 50:14.040]  He tried to stop the Bilderbergs conference before it began
[50:14.040 --> 50:22.160]  He wrote to our government, he wrote to the president here from St. Moritz
[50:22.160 --> 50:34.320]  And he tried to stop the conference. He said an undemocratic, intranstrant thing like that should not be here in Switzerland
[50:34.320 --> 50:44.960]  And some folks will say what free association isn't allowed. These are government ministers. You have laws there against government people meeting with other governments
[50:44.960 --> 50:48.560]  That's called treason to discuss things outside the purview of the people and make deals
[50:48.560 --> 50:52.880]  Hillary Clinton has been previously fined for attending Bilderberg under our Logan act
[50:52.880 --> 51:00.880]  What is the specific law because I know Switzerland has one sir against government meetings in secret with private interest
[51:00.880 --> 51:13.880]  Oh yes, we have these laws and I think our churches have to use that against the conference
[51:13.880 --> 51:23.880]  Now we're able to watch you live here streaming video. Who is that fellow standing next to you? A member of parliament, Lukas Reimann
[51:23.880 --> 51:35.880]  It's Dominik. He's just helping me because my English is not very good. But what I can say is there are some members of the national parliament in Switzerland
[51:35.880 --> 51:44.880]  And they do support you. They do support Ron Paul and they hope it will change a lot in the world in the next year
[51:44.880 --> 51:52.880]  Yes sir. I thought I recognized him. That's the fellow that helped write the original letters to get things going. We interviewed Dominik earlier
[51:52.880 --> 52:08.880]  Are there any other members of parliament there yet or do you know when they're arriving? Do you know when the leader of the pro Swiss independence, Mr. Dominik, do you know when he's going to arrive?
[52:08.880 --> 52:12.880]  He will arrive at 8 o'clock here in St. Moritz
[52:12.880 --> 52:14.880]  So he's arriving in about 30 minutes?
[52:14.880 --> 52:19.880]  European time. 30 minutes yes
[52:19.880 --> 52:33.880]  Well this is huge. Obviously then we need to let you guys get ready to go do that. And obviously are you going to march with him and the other member of parliament up to the gates of the Vipers Nest?
[52:33.880 --> 52:39.880]  We try our best. I can call him and ask if he could arrive a little bit earlier
[52:39.880 --> 52:55.880]  Oh no that's fine. We're going to be going into the next hour sir. So we're going to let you go but after you have anything else you'd like to add and then we'll obviously get your phone number and then we're going to follow you around so that we can have full coverage of what's happening
[52:55.880 --> 53:00.880]  Okay thank you so much for your work and good luck for the future
[53:00.880 --> 53:14.880]  Thank you so much. Please give the phone back to Paul Watson. Jaren, talk to Paul. Give him the direction. Thank you. Alright this is unbelievable. So this is what real media, real cutting edge, real new network next generation info war is about.
[53:14.880 --> 53:28.880]  We are watching live video from Switzerland if you're a prison planet.TV member. The radio listeners are listening to this. This is all happening live time and I'm the director of this so I am here on air from Austin, Texas
[53:28.880 --> 53:43.880]  Directing great patriots and media people there in their coverage of what's happening and talking to folks along with the rest of the crew helping in this symphony to bring you this information. Great job to the crew.
[53:43.880 --> 53:50.880]  I am absolutely blown away by the coverage today. I would imagine you are. This is so exciting.
[53:50.880 --> 53:58.880]  You know I only did this one time on air about two years ago because it's such a big deal to my family and your family and everybody else who loves freedom.
[53:58.880 --> 54:07.880]  Anybody that doesn't want to be a slave. The global is control the oil. They control the carbon. They've designed a carbon based system. We are a carbon based planet.
[54:07.880 --> 54:20.880]  And part of the carbon cycle is carbon dioxide, water, oxygen and sunlight. And if they're able to control and tax any one of those, it's over total domination. And so here they are controlling the main carbon system.
[54:20.880 --> 54:33.880]  And then they're the same ones that want to restrict it to us through this system. And when it came out with the emails and the premeditated lies and the fact that they know carbon is good and more carbon dioxide is good and the temperature has actually started dropping overall.
[54:33.880 --> 54:44.880]  They can always show you some micro temperature increases, but I can show you decreases. The point is I had the guys go get champagne and pop it on air. And I've obviously got a long trip ahead of me and a lot of work to do today.
[54:44.880 --> 54:54.880]  So I'm not going to do that. I'm not a big drinker, but let me tell you tonight in New York, I'm going to go out to dinner with tomorrow night Gerald Salente.
[54:54.880 --> 55:04.880]  But with Ted Anderson, you better believe I don't even like champagne that much. There's going to be a bottle of expensive champagne being drunk because I mean this is this is awesome.
[55:04.880 --> 55:17.880]  And we are about to see something that is so off the charts, just absolutely fantastic. I am beside myself right now with Glee.
[55:17.880 --> 55:28.880]  The huge dam breaking, just Drudge Report, Newsweek, Time, BBC, London Guardian, hundreds of other papers, Bilderberg, World Government, what are they talking about in there?
[55:28.880 --> 55:38.880]  We've got the moles inside. We've got the intel. We've got live video and now three prominent, one of them is like, I was looking him up the last few weeks.
[55:38.880 --> 55:50.880]  I've read about him years ago. He's bigger than Ron Paul in Switzerland. I mean, the Ron Paul of Switzerland, very high level in the parliament, right up beneath the Prime Minister, is marching on Bilderberg today.
[55:50.880 --> 55:57.880]  The Prime Minister came out. It was in Swiss papers. We did screenshots of those, put them on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[55:57.880 --> 56:09.880]  And they are getting, well, those are now up on the site with the headlines that the Prime Minister says they don't like the meeting happening there. I mean, it is a rebuke.
[56:09.880 --> 56:17.880]  See, with their trillions, with their fancy suits, with their Mercedes, with their armed guards, with all of this mystique and the helicopters, everybody just bows down to them.
[56:17.880 --> 56:28.880]  Why? They're crooks. It's like Bank of America thinking they can take houses without even having any type of deed or somebody buys the house in cash. They have no history, no claim.
[56:28.880 --> 56:40.880]  They come and take it. The court says, well, it's five months later. We said, give them their house back. You haven't. So we're going to send deputies to seize your bank and take the cash out and pay them on the barrel head.
[56:40.880 --> 56:49.880]  That's the people's court. That's America. That's Switzerland. That's what the Dutch had. That's real freedom. Nobody else ever had what the Swiss have had. Nobody ever had what people in America had.
[56:49.880 --> 56:59.880]  Nobody ever had what the Dutch had. And they're taking it away. It's a lie that our system came from the Greeks and the Romans. There's a little bit of that in there. It's Swiss.
[56:59.880 --> 57:11.880]  And people better get that through their head. The Swiss are all given automatic weapons and hand grenades, and then they have yearly searches in the house to make sure the guns are hidden.
[57:11.880 --> 57:19.880]  To make sure a foreign government comes in, your guns are so hidden, our own gunfinders can't find them. I mean, that's what it's all about.
[57:19.880 --> 57:29.880]  People are like, well, one of the freest groups, the richest group, lowest crime rate in the world, automatic weapons, hand grenades, grenade launchers. The crime rate is non-existent.
[57:29.880 --> 57:50.880]  And I'm telling you, that's why it's happening there.
[57:50.880 --> 58:02.880]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road. But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[58:02.880 --> 58:23.880]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans. They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit. They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[58:23.880 --> 58:49.880]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[58:49.880 --> 58:53.880]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[58:53.880 --> 58:58.880]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[58:58.880 --> 59:09.880]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[59:09.880 --> 59:18.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[59:18.880 --> 59:25.880]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[59:25.880 --> 59:35.880]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my old sponsors.
[59:35.880 --> 59:50.880]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[59:50.880 --> 01:00:08.880]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:24.880]  Okay, so the big fat parasites, the social vampires, the economic ringwraiths, the Nosferatu's are perched in St. Mort Switzerland right now, going to great lengths to not be seen engaged in their skull-duggery.
[01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:31.880]  As they plan the next country they're going to bring down to the next war they're going to launch. And we're taking your calls right now, ahead of a bunch of other key news.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:42.880]  Matt in England, Joseph in Germany, Paul in Ireland, the toll-tree number to join us from Europe, 800-259-9231. Matt in England, you're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:52.880]  Hi Alex, thanks for taking my call. I just want to say, first of all, to all the UK informal warriors that are listening to your show now, get to St. Moritz, get there as fast as you can if you can.
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:01:04.880]  Borrow the money and get there and shout out because this affects this country as well. I mean, Alex, you've heard a lot of things. There's been a sensational outburst there mentioning the gender that affects us already all over the world.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:15.880]  You know, higher interest rates. I reckon that's their policies that they're going to set their agendas to. High interest rates, 10 trails, I reckon they're going to enforce that even more.
[01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:23.880]  Oh yeah, the CFR is called for more geoengineering. They publicly admit their chemtrailing. Then if you tell the public, they laugh at you. They're changing the atmosphere.
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:32.880]  And over 70 percent, Monckton says it's 87 percent now, of your laws are made by the unelected EU board controlled and chaired by Bilderberg minions.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:41.880]  I mean, Rumpy and Barroso are there right now getting their orders from the sinister royalty. This is so disgusting.
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:47.880]  So go face down the real enemy peacefully. Draw attention to them.
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:58.880]  And I mean, also, you know, I think the other agenda that they're going to enforce is a more rising gas and petrol, petrol over a gas in America.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:13.880]  And the other thing is, I remember just in the video on YouTube, there's a video going up from the BBC or a disinfo goon obviously from the BBC.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:16.880]  Who is that? What's his name?
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:32.880]  I don't know who it was. Just been sent here about an hour ago. I haven't really watched all the way through it, but basically, from the BBC and this guy, it sounded like a disinfo goon basically mentioned that all people believe 9-11's inside job are mentally unstable.
[01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:38.880]  Well, that's what they're saying. If you don't believe in global warming, you should be arrested. That's openly called for in the British Parliament now.
[01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.880]  Very, very dangerous. These are tyrants. Thank you so much, Matt.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:49.880]  Yeah, if you don't believe Wiener, when he blamed Andrew Brettbart for making up the photo and hacking a site, turns out it was a total lie.
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:58.880]  But still, you got to believe Wiener or you're mentally ill. In fact, I'm going to be establishment. Wiener told the truth. Brettbart is bad.
[01:02:58.880 --> 01:03:07.880]  And Bill Clinton didn't lie. That's right. We're supposed to believe what they say. Joseph in Germany, you're on the air. Welcome from Deutschland.
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:17.880]  Hello, Alex Jones. Thank you very much. I want to say the people from Germany are awake. There are awake people here in Germany.
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:25.880]  And we are going to the Bilderberg meeting. And if anyone wants to join us, we are a group. You can just eat. Hello, do you hear me?
[01:03:25.880 --> 01:03:27.880]  Yes, sir. I'm listening to you.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:37.880]  There's a group of us going, if you want to join us, just email at Bilderberg, 2011, at poodlemail.com.
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:44.880]  Else, I have some information. They have been hyping another force-like terror attack here in Germany.
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:55.880]  The 26th of June, it's the starting of the Women's Soccer World League.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:04:03.880]  Yeah, they hype up that every event's going to be struck, so they have an excuse to stick their hands down your pants and train you for concentration camp living.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:09.880]  You know, Germany per capita has paid even more money than the U.S. to these private bankers as bailouts.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:16.880]  And now Obama is trying to order Merkel to give even more of your tax money to the bankers in the name of saving the E.U.
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:25.880]  And I've seen polls of over 80% of Germans are outraged by this, and Merkel almost lost her seat in the last parliamentary run.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:30.880]  What are the Germans' average view of these banker Nosferatu's?
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:41.880]  Well, the Germans are very upset, as you said, and the Germans feel like the German government is just like the horse,
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:53.880]  like pushing and working for the whole of Europe, paying for pain, paying for grief, paying for everyone, and people honestly don't like it.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:17.880]  Soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[01:05:17.880 --> 01:05:25.880]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes, deodorants, or antibacterials.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:33.880]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and a terror-eating clothing called lint.
[01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:38.880]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:46.880]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsope.com.
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:06:09.880]  Take charge of your health now by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at 5starsope.com.
[01:06:16.880 --> 01:06:25.880]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:30.880]  We are now eight minutes into hour number two of this worldwide transmission.
[01:06:30.880 --> 01:06:39.880]  I want to give the number out for Europeans, people going under the debt austerity of the banksters who, on record,
[01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:47.880]  own government admits engaged in crimes, creating 1.5 quadrillion in derivatives, and now we've got to, quote, bail them out and have them make record profits,
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:52.880]  or they threaten to implode the rest of our economy because, like Siamese twins,
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:58.880]  they have woven all of our currency and our infrastructure and our investments into their system and they're holding us hostage.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:07:04.880]  The issue is, though, they want austerity, they want to make us poor so we can be politically controlled.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:09.880]  Bilderberg has admitted that. These globalists use poverty as a tool.
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:15.880]  So if you give in to their hostage-taking economically, if you give in to their economic terrorism,
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:20.880]  they then just bring you step-by-step into deeper and deeper bondage.
[01:07:20.880 --> 01:07:26.880]  So all we can do is say, go ahead, give us the depression, slam everything down, we're going to arrest every single one of you.
[01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:31.880]  Believe me, if our governments start to do the right thing and indict these people, even Rolling Stone,
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:35.880]  two weeks ago, said the Senate committee has found total crime by these big megabanks.
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:41.880]  Where are the indictments? Where are they? Arrest them all. It's us or them.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:47.880]  They own both major parties in every major country. It's us or them. Their crimes are legion.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:54.880]  Their crimes are open. And now Obama is saying, oh, Germany and others don't want to give trillions more,
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.880]  but America is, they don't want to give trillions more to the bankers.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:02.880]  It's not really a banker bailout. It's giving it to them or they'll hold Europe hostage and suck us down with it.
[01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:09.880]  And he's saying he's pressing Europe to pony up along with the U.S. with more tax money
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:13.880]  that goes directly to these megabanks that engineered all this.
[01:08:13.880 --> 01:08:17.880]  And his entire administration is Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:21.880]  The entire stinking thing. I mean, this is incredible.
[01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:27.880]  And they own Romney of Romney care, the model for Obamacare. A lot of Republicans don't care.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:33.880]  You know what? As long as it's a white guy and as long, you know what, they don't care if he's anti-gun either.
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:38.880]  They kind of like it. Well, I'm not one of you mainline Republican idiots.
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:43.880]  That's all I have to say. And a lot of Americans are waking up to what's going on
[01:08:43.880 --> 01:08:48.880]  and waking up to what's happening and figuring things out. Now, the media is trying to ignore Ron Paul.
[01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.880]  Well, you can ignore Ron Paul all day. He's getting the word out and the people are listening
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:55.880]  and you're losing more and more credibility mainstream media.
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:08:58.880]  You're not going to be mainstream very long. You're becoming a joke.
[01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:03.880]  And we've broken the electronic Berlin Wall, the news blackout on Bilderberg 2011,
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:08.880]  the top two reports on DrudgeReport.com right now.
[01:09:08.880 --> 01:09:15.880]  Bombscare shuts down the road to Bilderberg meeting and they use that as a foil to basically shut things down
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:21.880]  so we couldn't get video of their faces, but not before we got the head of NATO, Bill Gates and others.
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:27.880]  Also, secret agenda leaked by mole. I want to go over some of that secret agenda later in the hour.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:32.880]  That's really our biggest news. And of course, we're calling for a giant protest.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:36.880]  People all over Europe have come out in the millions against tyranny and the austerity.
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:42.880]  These are the people that did it with the 47% unemployment in many European countries now
[01:09:42.880 --> 01:09:46.880]  and people under 30, the 20% plus unemployment in the general public.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:52.880]  These are the people that raise your taxes where the average European pays over 70% in taxes.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:10:00.880]  These are the people that openly have their banking heads, the treasury heads, the ex-checker of England,
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:05.880]  all of them, former heads like Alan Greenspan, all out saying we need to raise your taxes.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:11.880]  Warren Buffett, who got hundreds of billions of your bailout money, your money,
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:15.880]  he says raise taxes on the rich, meanwhile he's exempt from it.
[01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:20.880]  Fortune 500 pay on average 2.4% taxes. They're globalists. They're international.
[01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:23.880]  They've exempted themselves from the law.
[01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:27.880]  Oh, we need to help the poor. Remember the carbon tax two years ago in Copenhagen?
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:32.880]  And the treaty got leaked. They wouldn't release the treaty, but the third world countries leaked the treaty
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:38.880]  and the Danes released the treaty and it had right at, right at, not exactly double, but right at
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:44.880]  one point away from double the carbon taxes on the third world that the West had to have.
[01:10:44.880 --> 01:10:50.880]  See, they sold to the third world. Hey Africans, hey Latin Americans, hey Asians, you're going to get bailout money.
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:56.880]  You're going to get all this money from rich, fat Americans who are greedy and have a high standard of living.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:11:00.880]  And boy, they bellied up to the bar and said, you bet we're ready to sign this.
[01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:05.880]  And they got the treaty and they said, what? And the bankers want to kill the third world.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:09.880]  They're a bunch of eugenicists who openly write books calling black people animals.
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:14.880]  Of course they want to cut off all your energy. It's always been the globalist western plan by the elites
[01:11:14.880 --> 01:11:19.880]  to stop development of the third world. That's in the British 1949 Royal Commission on Population
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:24.880]  where they said, if we industrialize the third world, they will not overpopulate from their perspective.
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:29.880]  They will then, though, be rivals to us and we won't have hegemonic control.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:34.880]  Instead, we'll keep them in the dark ages, in the stone ages, but it will make them then have giant populations
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:37.880]  because poor people have more kids on average. So how do we deal with that?
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:43.880]  Well, then we come in behind that with Planned Parenthood and sterilizations and forced abortions
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:51.880]  and pay India and pay Peru and pay African countries on record to forcefully grab women and sterilize them.
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:58.880]  We're going to keep the poor, not only industrialize and do our best to kill you, keep you from having babies.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:03.880]  I mean, these people are sick. They are sick and they are the enemies of humanity.
[01:12:03.880 --> 01:12:07.880]  So if you want to do something historical, people are like, oh, it won't do anything.
[01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.880]  Oh, yes, it will. Look how far we've come.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:13.880]  As I told you 10 years ago, we're pushing and pushing and making Bilderberg come out in mainstream news
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:20.880]  to identify the real global controllers of this planet, the real global controllers of this planet.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:30.880]  Once you identify them, then you're not looking at Obama or Bush or Perry or Sarkozy or Barroso.
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:36.880]  You're looking at the real owners, those 10 to 8 families you can debate,
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:41.880]  but we've written and posted a detailed analysis at infowars.com of the 8 ruling families.
[01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:47.880]  It's in the Four Horsemen of the New World Order piece that was up there last week.
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:50.880]  And they can only get away with this if they're hidden.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:55.880]  That's why they go to such links to build a tunnel for hundreds of yards for them to drive into,
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.880]  of, you know, white walls so nobody can get video of them in St. Mort's, Switzerland.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.880]  That's why they're shutting down the road.
[01:13:02.880 --> 01:13:06.880]  That's why you heard from Inside Bilderberg sources, Rupert Murdoch was asked by Bilderberg
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:12.880]  to please talk to all the newspaper and media people he knows and ask them not to cover this here in the U.S.
[01:13:12.880 --> 01:13:16.880]  But they have to cover it because we're covering it and the Drudge Report's covering it,
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.880]  and now it's one of the biggest news items in the world, and it's only going to get bigger
[01:13:20.880 --> 01:13:25.880]  when you in Europe who are a few hours away hop a train and get in there,
[01:13:25.880 --> 01:13:29.880]  and all you got to do is sit there and chant down with tyranny, down with Bilderberg,
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:35.880]  and as you're driving on your cell phone or your car on the train, call local media and tell them to be there,
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:39.880]  and it's going to be an absolute fiasco for the Bilderberg group.
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:41.880]  What did Brzezinski say last year? He says,
[01:13:41.880 --> 01:13:49.880]  for the first time in human history, humanity is awakened, staring. No longer are they able to be manipulated politically.
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.880]  They understand the ruling class.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:57.880]  The Federal Reserve just five, six years ago, maybe five percent of Americans knew it was private,
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:01.880]  knew it was a big scam, was bankrupting our country for a dollar to be created,
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:04.880]  a dollar of debt is created and given to them out of nothing.
[01:14:04.880 --> 01:14:08.880]  They knew this. They understood this.
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:15.880]  And now I've seen the Gallup polls three years ago when Ron Paul was exposing it on the national platform being demonized.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:17.880]  It was upwards of 75 percent.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:19.880]  A year ago it was 80 percent.
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:27.880]  I've seen major scientific polls, 85 and higher of Americans want to abolish the Fed, audit the Fed, and know they're the enemy.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.880]  And the banksters are going, oops, they're not looking at our marionettes.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:32.880]  Remember the old Bill Hicks line?
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:36.880]  Hey, I like the puppet on the left. Hey, I like the puppet on the right.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:42.880]  And one guy goes, hey, there's one guy holding both puppets.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.880]  When humanity reaches that point and it has.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:50.880]  But everyone still feels like we're alone. We're the minority.
[01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:56.880]  No, we're not. No, we're not. You aren't public figures. You aren't known. You aren't recognized.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:01.880]  I cannot walk down the street anywhere. I cannot go into 7-Eleven.
[01:15:01.880 --> 01:15:05.880]  I cannot go to a shopping mall. I cannot go to a target. I cannot go anywhere.
[01:15:05.880 --> 01:15:09.880]  Years ago, I'd walk by 50 people and two groups would stop.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:15.880]  Now, I walk by a group of 50 people. I get mobbed and I can't even get out of there because they all want to take photos and shake my hand.
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:19.880]  And then it builds up because people have that, you know, thing that they're kind of scared to get outside their bubble.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:23.880]  But once they see people talking to me, then they come over, then they come over and it's great to talk to you.
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:25.880]  I've just got somewhere to go.
[01:15:25.880 --> 01:15:27.880]  Again, I'm not bragging. Oh, look, Alex is a celebrity.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:34.880]  The point is I'm somebody who can uniquely tell you that the awakening is much bigger than you've known.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:39.880]  I just got chills. It's much bigger. We can beat these people.
[01:15:39.880 --> 01:15:59.880]  Music plays
[01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:04.880]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:08.880]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.880]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:19.880]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:24.880]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:27.880]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:34.880]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:16:34.880 --> 01:16:38.880]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.880]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:16:41.880 --> 01:16:43.880]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:48.880]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:16:48.880 --> 01:16:53.880]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com.

[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:06.880]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions,
[01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:15.880]  yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:19.880]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:24.880]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:32.880]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:40.880]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:50.880]  Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:20:10.880]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:21.880]  What we've got here is failure to communicate. Some men you just can't reach.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:36.880]  So you get what we had here last week, which is the way he wants it. Well, he is. I don't like it anymore.
[01:20:36.880 --> 01:20:42.880]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:49.880]  We're going to Peter in Switzerland, Paul in Ireland, and others. I know that most Europeans cannot call a 1-800 number.
[01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:56.880]  It just doesn't work. And if you do call the toll number to the network, we will put you to the head of the line.
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:21:07.880]  6-5-1-6-9-5-7-7-7-7 to the Genesis Board so that you're able to call, again, doll your country code, our country code.
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:13.880]  I forget what the, what is the US country code? And then 6-5-1-6-9-5-7-7-7-7.
[01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:19.880]  I only call Europe, so I know Ireland, Britain, Germany, and in Italy, but I don't know our own.
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:30.880]  So the doll the US country code, and then 6-5-1-6-9-5-7-7-7-7, or you can get through on Skype on the 1-800-1-800-259-9031.
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:37.880]  Normally, we just give out the calls. We can get, you know, 1,000 in 10 minutes if we want, literally, into our computer phone board.
[01:21:37.880 --> 01:21:44.880]  But from Europe, we've got three callers lined up. Paul, Peter, Nick, and others. I see rolling in there.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:51.880]  I'm going to talk to you in just a moment, but I briefly wanted to point this out that growing up, you know, you're taught in school and college
[01:21:51.880 --> 01:22:00.880]  that third-worlders are a bunch of idiot savages, basically. I mean, it's done with a velvet glove, but, oh, those people, they just can't get themselves together.
[01:22:00.880 --> 01:22:04.880]  And ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. Well, that's not what's going on.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:16.880]  The colonial areas of Latin America, Africa, and Southern Asia and other areas have been overrun by the more advanced technological militaries of the West repeatedly in the last 300 years.
[01:22:16.880 --> 01:22:24.880]  And systems of tyranny are put in. And then the last 100 years, and this is mainline history of your research, and this is not my opinion,
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:35.880]  and major white papers were written by the British government, the U.S. government deployed gunboat diplomacy where they would give a dictator or give a thug, say, in Venezuela or Guatemala.
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:46.880]  This goes back over 100 years, the U.S. They give them a $20 million loan, and openly it would come out. Tell them, don't pay this back, leave in one year with the money to Switzerland or to New York.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:53.880]  That's why you have a lot of Mexican presidents actually move to New York after they steal a bunch of money just a few decades ago that happened or in the mid-90s.
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:59.880]  So it's the same system. Or they go to Switzerland. That's kind of the place where they nest, and it's a free zone they allow.
[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:08.880]  And then the public's told, well, with interest, it's been 10 years. You don't know, it's $20 million in 1905. You owe us $300 million.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:15.880]  And the country says, back then, that was before the inflation we have. It was equivalent to $300 billion or something.
[01:23:15.880 --> 01:23:27.880]  They said, we don't even make that in 20 years. We can't pay it. Oh, that's fine. From the shores of Montezuma, from the halls of Montezuma to the shores of Tripoli.
[01:23:27.880 --> 01:23:37.880]  And the Marine Corps top general, two-time congressional medal of honor winner, Spendley Butler finally quit and went public and said, look, it's all about money. These people don't owe it. We invade them.
[01:23:37.880 --> 01:23:41.880]  And that's what's now happening here in America. And then I'm going to your calls.
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:50.880]  That's what's now happening here and happening to Europe. And the bankers said in the 2002 IMF World Bank documents, they were going to do what they've done in the third world to us.
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:59.880]  There's a reason the third world has, you go to major cities in the third world, hundreds of thousands of homeless people and starvation and corrupt police and death and degradation.
[01:23:59.880 --> 01:24:12.880]  It's because it's the globalist policy on record in the IMF World Bank documents that BBC was forced to cover to create a system to get them in debt through fraud and then never let them get out of it.
[01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:21.880]  They want you to be poor. Now, that's why I get so angry at these people. They are assaulting me with high taxes. They are assaulting us with carbon taxes.
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:31.880]  They are assaulting us with government minders and secret police and spies. I know history. I know what happened in East Germany. I'm angry about this.
[01:24:31.880 --> 01:24:35.880]  I don't want to be a slave because I'm not going to survive in that environment.
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:42.880]  Somebody, some corrupt cop gets in my face, starts bossing me around. Folks, I go crazy. I'm not a slave. I'm red-blooded.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:56.880]  Okay? These people are crooks on record. And they've got this Bengali mesmerized hoax running on people. We've got to break the hoax, break the chains, wake up, break the mental block, see them for what they are,
[01:24:56.880 --> 01:25:04.880]  and get transparency and government back, have our governments control our money and currency, and take these mega bankers to prison.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:14.880]  And you better know I'm risking my life coming straight at them and saying, go protest them in mass as I direct here for my command base. Get over there, get in their face.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:24.880]  Get over there and peacefully expose who they are. All right, I'm going to stop ranting. I'm going to stop ranting. Let's go to Peter in Switzerland and Paul, Nick, John, and others.
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:33.880]  We've got calls in Ireland, Switzerland, Italy, you name it, Scotland. Let's go to Peter in beautiful Switzerland. Peter, where are you and what's your view on this?
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:53.880]  Hi, Alex. I'm in Zug, Switzerland, and I need to give you some information. During the World Economic Forum in Davos, there are usually these anti-world economic forum groups that try and get on the trains from CORE going up to Davos.
[01:25:53.880 --> 01:26:10.880]  And it's a special train. It's called the Red Dish Abaddon, and this is the same train that goes to St. Moritz. And I just let you know that they either suspend the train service or they control everyone in CORE an hour and a half away before they get on the trains.
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:22.880]  So you've got to, in fact, I've seen that, and it's on record that the socialists, they're going to be there tomorrow, openly are financed by the Bilderberg group to then make anybody who's anti-Bilderberg look like a communist.
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:33.880]  That's why we, and I do it everywhere, we've got to have real people who aren't camp following useful idiots there use CORE. That's why you've got two days. Leave now. Get there early.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:43.880]  Don't wait because we need folks to mass there. That's why they're hiding out. They're sucking Europe and the rest of the world dry right now, and that's why they're hiding out in St. Moritz.
[01:26:43.880 --> 01:26:46.880]  So are you an American or a Canadian living in Switzerland?
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:55.880]  I'm a dual citizen. I'm a Swiss citizen, also an American, and trying to get down there I think is really going to be a challenge this weekend.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:27:06.880]  I'll tell you, the Swiss are great people. That's why they've got so much wealth and everybody's got guns and they've got bunkers for the entire population. You know, the Amish are made up of what Germans, Swiss and Dutch, great people.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:20.880]  And I see a lot of top Swiss politicians, your prime minister, one of your, the equivalent of one of your congresspeople, calling for some of the Bilderberg people's arrest, and we've confirmed that's all over your papers.
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:27.880]  That's pretty exciting. What are the Swiss saying about these vampires nesting, roosting in St. Moritz?
[01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:36.880]  People know about it. I mean, a lot of the Swiss I work with are very much aware of it, and the Swiss papers have actually been very good covering this event.
[01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:49.880]  But again, what I say is the Swiss know how to handle security, and my fear is that they will be preventing people from getting on the trains already two hours from the destination.
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:56.880]  Okay, but I mean, that's only, I mean, is that all the time, or are they just suspended the trains, period, for their lordships?
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:10.880]  No, they've done this during the World Economic Forum, that the trains leave from core, and those trains went to Davos, and they either suspended the trains or they controlled people before they even got on the trains.
[01:28:10.880 --> 01:28:13.880]  And they're probably going to do the same thing, heading down to St. Moritz.
[01:28:13.880 --> 01:28:17.880]  And by controlling them at the checkpoint, you mean they don't let you on the train?
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:19.880]  Correct.
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:29.880]  Well, again, that's because they're scared of the protests. They're scared of the eye of the public brought to the mountain of Mordor, so we can see the eye of Sauron sitting up there.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:35.880]  We've got to march on Mordor, and it's going to be so historical. I wish I could be there, but I'm a man of my word.
[01:28:35.880 --> 01:28:44.880]  I told talkers six months ago I'd be their keynote speaker, and then a few weeks ago I was thinking about crying to go and be there Wednesday, Thursday, and then fly back Friday,
[01:28:44.880 --> 01:28:51.880]  but I could have missed my keynote speech, which is in the morning at Talkers, so I'm going to be in New York.
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:19.880]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:24.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:28.880]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:31.880]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:29:31.880 --> 01:29:35.880]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:40.880]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:45.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:20.880]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[01:30:20.880 --> 01:30:28.880]  They're so bright in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:33.880]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[01:30:33.880 --> 01:30:38.880]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[01:30:38.880 --> 01:30:45.880]  We turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:10.880]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:16.880]  The United States has now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth.
[01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:22.880]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:28.880]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:32.880]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:37.880]  Prepare to enter the secret of world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:32:37.880 --> 01:32:43.880]  Body scammers, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street corner.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:46.880]  It's only the beginning of the new world order's hellish plan.
[01:32:46.880 --> 01:32:49.880]  The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[01:33:19.880 --> 01:33:21.880]  The Texas Command Center.
[01:33:21.880 --> 01:33:24.880]  And the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:27.880]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:52.880]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:59.880]  This is going to draw massive attention to what's going on.
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:04.880]  What do you suggest as somebody from Switzerland, sir?
[01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:06.880]  What do you suggest we do to circumvent?
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:08.880]  Because there are good roads in there.
[01:34:08.880 --> 01:34:13.880]  That's how Aaron and Paul drove in from Zurich.
[01:34:13.880 --> 01:34:20.880]  Yes, I suggest they may have to go to a staging area and walk or take public buses or something.
[01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:27.880]  I don't know, but I know from the anti-veth experience that they've actually controlled the trains.
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:29.880]  So people have to be aware of that.
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:34.880]  Maybe you have to go pretending that you're planning to go on a hike or something
[01:34:34.880 --> 01:34:40.880]  and demonstrate or pretend that you're not going there to demonstrate.
[01:34:40.880 --> 01:34:45.880]  Now, again, the Swiss have some of the best rights in the world, but the outsiders don't.
[01:34:45.880 --> 01:34:49.880]  That's the way it's supposed to be in a sovereign country, so I can't actually say it's bad.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:51.880]  But that's why it's important for Swiss to go.
[01:34:51.880 --> 01:34:53.880]  Because they can't, from what I've read, and correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:57.880]  they can't stop a Swiss citizen from getting on that train, can they?
[01:34:57.880 --> 01:34:59.880]  Actually, no, they have.
[01:34:59.880 --> 01:35:03.880]  They have stopped Swiss citizens if they were planning to protest.
[01:35:03.880 --> 01:35:06.880]  But the Swiss have got some of the strongest protest rights anywhere.
[01:35:06.880 --> 01:35:08.880]  They need to follow complaints if that happens.
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:12.880]  That's outrageous that Swiss would have their right of travel blocked
[01:35:12.880 --> 01:35:16.880]  for a bunch of outlying Auslanders coming in there.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:20.880]  Well, I've got to tell you, in many ways, this is a very secure place.
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:25.880]  And security trumps pretty much everything else.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:29.880]  Well, they're not going to stop people from this quest, and we've got maps up on the site.
[01:35:29.880 --> 01:35:34.880]  We're not going to be able to stop French driving in, Germans driving in, Italians driving in.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.880]  That's why if you're listening, folks, you've got to go.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:39.880]  And regardless, shoot video of them stopping at the train.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:40.880]  Upload it to YouTube.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.880]  Everyone listening should upload to US and European YouTube.
[01:35:43.880 --> 01:35:46.880]  They're trying to block everybody so you can't watch American YouTube,
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:47.880]  and we can't watch European.
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:49.880]  They don't want us to get together.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:52.880]  They want to geo-locate, and they admittedly are trying to go after alternative press.
[01:35:52.880 --> 01:35:54.880]  They're changing the algorithms.
[01:35:54.880 --> 01:35:58.880]  By the way, there's no doubt our term, Bilderberg protest, would have hit number one yesterday.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:02.880]  There is no doubt they've now created a catalog of names,
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:05.880]  because classic anti-globalist names don't work now when we do it.
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:09.880]  Only weird search terms that then link to articles we've written work.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:13.880]  So again, the head of Google goes every year.
[01:36:13.880 --> 01:36:17.880]  They are desperate to keep us from knowing they're there, knowing who's there, or protesting.
[01:36:17.880 --> 01:36:20.880]  Why is that, Peter?
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:25.880]  Well, I think these are the elites, and they have their own agenda.
[01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:30.880]  And what I don't understand is, why are people giving in to their agenda?
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:34.880]  Why do governments give in to this agenda?
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:38.880]  Because he who has the gold makes the rule, and even though they're criminals,
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:43.880]  they literally control trillions, and they've bought and paid for almost everybody while we were asleep.
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:47.880]  And now they're so arrogant, they're burning down society to consolidate it,
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.880]  and that's why they're hiding out in a rural area.
[01:36:49.880 --> 01:36:53.880]  They normally go to very big resorts right on the beach,
[01:36:53.880 --> 01:36:56.880]  but now the protests are so huge all over Europe, they are literally hiding,
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:59.880]  and that's why we must route them out, and by God we will.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.880]  So you're going to be going there, aren't you, Peter?
[01:37:02.880 --> 01:37:04.880]  I will be trying to get down there, yes.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:07.880]  And I'll find alternative ways to get in there if I have to.
[01:37:07.880 --> 01:37:12.880]  God bless you. We're going to be talking to you, and we'll cover the aftermath, of course, the next week as well.
[01:37:12.880 --> 01:37:14.880]  Thank you so much, Peter. Great job, folks.
[01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:17.880]  You know this is important. March on, tyranny, peacefully.
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:23.880]  Let's go ahead and talk to Nick in Italy, also bordering Switzerland.
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:25.880]  Nick, where are you in Italy?
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.880]  Yeah, how you doing, Alex?
[01:37:27.880 --> 01:37:32.880]  I'm actually in the city of Bologna, which we mentioned so many times about the Bologna bombing.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:38.880]  So as a native of the city, I'd like to thank you for being the only American media personality to actually mention that.
[01:37:38.880 --> 01:37:41.880]  What, did our government bombed you to blame it on their enemies?
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:43.880]  Yeah, we're very sorry.
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:49.880]  I died 300 people were injured in that, and some of those guys are actually over there in St. Moritz, partying it up.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:55.880]  And, you know, I was born about nine and a half months after the event, so my parents were there, were very close.
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:38:00.880]  So, I mean, that's something, every time you mention it, you know, I get a little bit emotional about it,
[01:38:00.880 --> 01:38:02.880]  because they're very, very close to me.
[01:38:02.880 --> 01:38:06.880]  So, and I want to just tell American folks how close this thing is to me.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:10.880]  And what these guys are doing is just criminal. There's no other words for it.
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:13.880]  Second of all, you mentioned Asia.
[01:38:13.880 --> 01:38:16.880]  Now there's going to be a lot of election coming up in Asia.
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:18.880]  They just had it in Burma. They're going to be in Thailand.
[01:38:18.880 --> 01:38:21.880]  And they were pushing one big thing in 2015.
[01:38:21.880 --> 01:38:25.880]  They will have something called the EAC, the Asian Economic Community.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:31.880]  Does that sounds familiar? The EAC, the European Economic Community, we have the same thing.
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:34.880]  Yeah, they're already signing deals, merging them.
[01:38:34.880 --> 01:38:40.880]  Now, I'm going from memory, but where is Bologna? How long will it take you to get into Switzerland?
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:46.880]  I think to the border is about 300 to 400 kilometers, because you have to go past Milan,
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:51.880]  and then past the Alps mountains, and then you have to go to St. Moritz.
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:56.880]  I mean, I might have a chance to go. I may actually have to pull some strings,
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:00.880]  but I'm going to try hard to get there, because I wanted to go a few years ago,
[01:39:00.880 --> 01:39:02.880]  when they had it in the island of Supreza.
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:05.880]  Look, look, you got to go. 20 years from now, if these people win,
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:10.880]  you are going to gnash your teeth wishing you'd gone. Please, please go.
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.880]  Do whatever you have to. Everybody go. I mean, it's so important.
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.880]  As you said, the same globalist almost killed your parents with that stage bombing in Bologna.
[01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:23.880]  Now, declassify the Italian government admits it with NATO and U.S. intelligence,
[01:39:23.880 --> 01:39:27.880]  a bunch of bombings to be blamed on political enemies there, then false flags.
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:30.880]  You've got to go. Every person that goes is so important.
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:33.880]  God bless you. Good to hear from you, from Italy.
[01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:36.880]  Let's talk to Paul in Ireland and John in Scotland.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:40.880]  Paul, thanks for holding. You're on the air.
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:44.880]  Hello, Alex. Hello.
[01:39:44.880 --> 01:39:50.880]  The first thing I'd like to say is that this country, Ireland, very soon is going to collapse.
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:55.880]  And many people are aware that there's a very great situation.
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:40:00.880]  The vast majority, I think, are still clueless as to what is the solution.
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:05.880]  Well, you notice you were the fastest growing winner until you signed on to the Euro,
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:10.880]  and suddenly they imploded you because that Euro treaty was the agreement to go under their receivership.
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:14.880]  You've been economically conquered, but I've seen it in your Irish times.
[01:40:14.880 --> 01:40:18.880]  Your people, it seems, do know what's happening. Sorry, go ahead.
[01:40:18.880 --> 01:40:25.880]  Well, unfortunately, the people were bullied into voting for these treaties.
[01:40:25.880 --> 01:40:29.880]  And finally, they bite the bait because money is so many...
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:33.880]  Yeah, they voted no the first time, yeah.
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:38.880]  What Gerald Salenta said yesterday is absolutely correct and applies to this country.
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:41.880]  The direct democracy now is the only answer.
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:46.880]  I contacted yesterday the founder of the direct democracy, Ireland,
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:51.880]  and children about your program to listen to Gerald Salenta,
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:58.880]  because the government we have here, going back to Brian Collins' government,
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:06.880]  that Collins' approach with the bankers, with the bailouts was basically when you're attacked by a mugger
[01:41:06.880 --> 01:41:09.880]  and he says, give me all your money or I'll shoot you.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:15.880]  Well, Brian Collins, as prime minister, was the kind of man who would hand over the wallet and give everything.
[01:41:15.880 --> 01:41:20.880]  Now that we have a new government, the policy of the new government in the county
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:25.880]  is to make a deal with the mugger and pay by installments.
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:27.880]  You're going to lose everything anyway.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:30.880]  What did the Irish think of a few months ago, the head of your central banks,
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:33.880]  saying, it's good for Ireland to be run by foreign banks.
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:41.880]  We're going under foreign banks' control. I mean, it was just a total statement of treason out in the open.
[01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:49.880]  Unfortunately, the people have been so brainwashed with what Colonel Robert Hixon of U.S. Army Intelligence
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:53.880]  called the perception management, as he said in one of the talks,
[01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:56.880]  perception management as we called it in the CIA.
[01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:05.880]  If you mention Bilderberg, I'm talking to you in this country, you get dismissed as a lunatic.
[01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:08.880]  You know why? Because for 50 years they said it didn't exist.
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:12.880]  And now there it is. Okay, it's no big deal, but you're still crazy if you don't like it.
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:16.880]  But we shut down whole countries for them to meet, but they have no power.
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:18.880]  We're being shut down here.
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:23.880]  We were told that by privatizing our trash collection, that it's going to save money.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:31.880]  Well, it saved me for the county. But now I'm burdened with a crushing fee to pay every time my trash is collected.
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:36.880]  And they tell us they have schemes, they're going to put aside to help save us money.
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:40.880]  It's horrible, my friend. I understand it's the austerity, it's the scam.
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:44.880]  Thank you so much, John and Scotland and others straight ahead.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:52.880]  If you want to join us from Europe, 651-695-7777 is the international line 651-695-7777.
[01:42:52.880 --> 01:42:55.880]  All your U.S. access code will be back.
[01:42:55.880 --> 01:43:24.880]  Reports live from Bilderberg coming up the next hour.
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:34.880]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores, and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:39.880]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have to do something you've never done before.
[01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:47.880]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calvin on the web at fivestarsope.com.

[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:19.880]  The name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:44:19.880 --> 01:44:24.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:44:24.880 --> 01:44:28.880]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:31.880]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:35.880]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:40.880]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:45.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:49.880]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[01:45:18.880 --> 01:45:19.880]  Are you kidding me?

[01:46:00.880 --> 01:46:04.880]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:10.880]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream.
[01:46:10.880 --> 01:46:13.880]  By breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:18.880]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:24.880]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[01:46:24.880 --> 01:46:29.880]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:33.880]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products,
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:39.880]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:44.880]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:52.880]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:46:52.880 --> 01:47:10.880]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:27.880]  This is Eric Dykes reporting live from San Marit, Switzerland.
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:33.880]  We have a rare opportunity today because there are literally more than 100 activists here at a live speaking event,
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:37.880]  which is in all German, which is why we're not covering it directly.
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:40.880]  We've had members of the Swiss Parliament.
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:45.880]  Perhaps we're expecting another arrival of a Swiss Parliament member, Dominic Betik,
[01:47:45.880 --> 01:47:48.880]  eminently.
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:49.880]  Hopefully he will come on.
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:53.880]  We also have Luke Radowski coming up and other activists.
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:59.880]  We were just talking about some of the high-level U.S. politicians who previously been to Bilderberg meetings
[01:47:59.880 --> 01:48:01.880]  who are now moving up to higher positions.
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:10.880]  One of them is Texas Governor Rick Perry, a very close Bush minion who was made, if you will, by Carl Rove back in the mid-80s.
[01:48:10.880 --> 01:48:12.880]  He used to be a Democrat.
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:22.880]  Carl Rove convinced him, along with Senator Phil Graham, to flip to Republican, and he only has gained in power and acumen since.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:25.880]  Rick Perry is now the longest-serving Texas Governor.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:29.880]  Also, Hillary Clinton has announced today, it's been on the top of the Drudge Report,
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:35.880]  the biggest alternative news website anywhere in the world, that she wants to be the next head of the World Bank.
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:42.880]  Sure, that would be a milestone for her to be the first woman, but she is entirely a Bilderberg minion and total globalist,
[01:48:42.880 --> 01:48:44.880]  just like her husband Bill Clinton.
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:48.880]  Just as he has announced, he wants to be the head of the United Nations.
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:56.880]  Hillary Clinton now wants the power of a huge bank that works in conjunction with the IMF to really put third-world countries,
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:49:04.880]  developing countries into economic enslavement, really continuing what used to be a colonialism pattern.
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:10.880]  And now, through the bailouts and other arrangements in Europe, many of these countries are being brought to bear.
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:17.880]  Switzerland itself is fighting in an island of the EU not to accept the EU currency,
[01:49:17.880 --> 01:49:21.880]  not to join the European Union to keep their sovereignty, and why not?
[01:49:21.880 --> 01:49:27.880]  They have one of the highest living standards anywhere in the world, so we should stand with the Switzerland people.
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:33.880]  There's really great, weird change activist group here on the ground in Switzerland from all the different major cities,
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:38.880]  really incredible, even though they have some of the big, globalist banks like the Bank of International Settlement.
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:42.880]  But it would be really interesting if Hillary took the World Bank position.
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:48.880]  Of course, the past several World Bank heads have all been Bilderberg attendees, most of them Perennial,
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.880]  most of them every single year.
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:57.880]  That includes James Wolfensen, a multi-generational servant of the Rothschild family.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:04.880]  It includes Neocon, Paul Wolfowitz, who had his own World Bank scandal and had to step down a few years ago
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:09.880]  when they introduced Robert Zollig, also, of course, a big globalist minion.
[01:50:09.880 --> 01:50:11.880]  Now, Hillary Clinton were to take the position.
[01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:13.880]  That would be key.
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:17.880]  In other news, we have received the list.
[01:50:17.880 --> 01:50:18.880]  It was leaked earlier today.
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:20.880]  It's on infowars.com.
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:23.880]  It's been on fraudreport.com as one of the top links.
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:29.880]  And we know one part of their agenda is, of course, to perpetuate the war in Libya
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.880]  as they look to other regions in the Middle East.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:34.880]  That's been part of their long-term plan.
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:40.880]  Of course, we've just witnessed the Arab Spring with protests, violent protests, crackdowns,
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:49.880]  all kinds of shifting geopolitical acts of significance in Egypt, Tunisia, Syria, Lebanon,
[01:50:49.880 --> 01:50:53.880]  the United Arab Emirates, the different parts of the peninsula there.
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:59.880]  And we know from last year in 2010, they leaked on the official Bilderberg meeting site
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:04.880]  that there was a discussion from Obama to the...
[01:51:04.880 --> 01:51:05.880]  I don't have it in front of me.
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:10.880]  I don't have the exact words, but it was about from Obama to the path to the Iranian Revolution
[01:51:10.880 --> 01:51:15.880]  using new social media, including Twitter and other aspects.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:19.880]  And we know there's been meetings in the U.S. propping up some of the revolutionaries
[01:51:19.880 --> 01:51:21.880]  in that area of the world.
[01:51:21.880 --> 01:51:28.880]  And coinciding with that, we really have a powerhouse of the internet empire here at the meeting.
[01:51:28.880 --> 01:51:37.880]  We have among them, excuse me, one moment while I can solo the list,
[01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:41.880]  we have the Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes.
[01:51:41.880 --> 01:51:45.880]  We have also Craig Mundy of Microsoft.
[01:51:45.880 --> 01:51:49.880]  There's also the Bilderberg steering member, Peter Field.
[01:51:49.880 --> 01:51:51.880]  He's the PayPal executive.
[01:51:51.880 --> 01:51:54.880]  He's also a big investor in Facebook.
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:59.880]  Actually, quite interestingly, he also endorsed Ron Paul in 2007.
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:02.880]  He's a bit of a libertarian, but also a hedge fund manager.
[01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:08.880]  And obviously, they're trying to control the online dominion and as well as influence
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:11.880]  all these social revolutions, particularly in the Middle East.
[01:52:11.880 --> 01:52:16.880]  So that's another area to watch as we get more information out of the 2011 meeting.
[01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:21.880]  Of course, down on the ground, we've seen an incredible police response crack down.
[01:52:21.880 --> 01:52:28.880]  We've just received reports that they've challenged protesters on the line a few minutes ago.
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:33.880]  Reports last night that a member of the Italian EU parliament tried to enter the meeting.
[01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:36.880]  He was pushed down and his nose was bloodied.
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:38.880]  So it's just incredible tyranny.
[01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:42.880]  And I think Bilderberg is going to see a Gandhi-like response.
[01:52:42.880 --> 01:52:46.880]  But moving on, we have sitting next to me, Luke Radowski.
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:51.880]  He's the founder of We Are Changed and has been an incredible activist for the past several years.
[01:52:51.880 --> 01:52:56.880]  And he, of course, is also, as a part of that, been covering Bilderberg for,
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:59.880]  what is it, Luke, the past three or the past four years?
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:00.880]  Too many years.
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:01.880]  Too many years now.
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:04.880]  Yeah, we're all deep in the trenches at this point.
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:08.880]  So I'm going to pass the phone to you, Luke, and tell us some of your observations here.
[01:53:08.880 --> 01:53:12.880]  And what do you expect to see as the outcome from Bilderberg, not only this year,
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:19.880]  but in the future, as this incredible focus and attention, media attention, is put on them,
[01:53:19.880 --> 01:53:22.880]  turning around the paradigm, showing who they are.
[01:53:22.880 --> 01:53:24.880]  Luke Radowski.
[01:53:24.880 --> 01:53:29.880]  I think it's very amazing to see each year how much the media coverage of this event gets bigger
[01:53:29.880 --> 01:53:31.880]  and bigger every year we go on.
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:36.880]  And right now we are seeing the growth of alternative media that is covering this Bilderberg group
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:38.880]  meeting from top to bottom.
[01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:42.880]  And it's just amazing seeing not the mainstream media that's controlled by the corporations,
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:47.880]  but the people of this world showing everybody else who all would one YouTube video,
[01:53:47.880 --> 01:53:50.880]  with a Facebook post or a Twitter post, exactly what's happening.
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:53.880]  And that's where people are getting most of the majority of their information.
[01:53:53.880 --> 01:53:56.880]  And I have to say, we are the mainstream media.
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:58.880]  It's no longer, we're trying to become it.
[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:03.880]  We actually have become it because most of our information is given and shared throughout the world.
[01:54:03.880 --> 01:54:04.880]  And it's just beautiful.
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:07.880]  I mean, there's so many great activists here from all walks of life.
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:09.880]  There's people with kids here.
[01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:10.880]  There's older people.
[01:54:10.880 --> 01:54:11.880]  There's young people.
[01:54:11.880 --> 01:54:16.880]  And it's just beautiful seeing so many different people of all walks of life coming together
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:18.880]  to document what's happening here.
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:20.880]  I wouldn't even call this a protest.
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:23.880]  Everybody has a DSLR camera around their neck.
[01:54:23.880 --> 01:54:26.880]  Everybody has professional camera equipment, picture equipment.
[01:54:26.880 --> 01:54:29.880]  And we're here just trying to show the world what's happening.
[01:54:29.880 --> 01:54:37.880]  And it's just beautiful with the potential and so much amazing things that we could just show people
[01:54:37.880 --> 01:54:42.880]  without any corporate mainstream media saying, oh, no, you can't talk about this.
[01:54:42.880 --> 01:54:44.880]  There's so many We Are Changed chapters here.
[01:54:44.880 --> 01:54:45.880]  It's even hard to list.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:47.880]  I can't even keep track of all of them.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:50.880]  And We Are Changed, which Ellen is doing an amazing job down here.
[01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:53.880]  They organized an amazing event that we're at right now.
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:59.880]  They have also wrote their local politicians exactly what's happening, the harassment that has been going on.
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:03.880]  I've been here for about two days now, and I already got my passport taken away.
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:05.880]  I already got detained.
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:12.880]  I already got threatened with arrest and deportation from the country just because I'm here filming what's going on.
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:17.880]  And the question has to be asked that these so-called rich people don't have nothing to hide
[01:55:17.880 --> 01:55:19.880]  and aren't doing anything sinister.
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:25.880]  Why in the world are they treating people who want to cover this event, who want to document what's happening here,
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:27.880]  being treated like criminals?
[01:55:27.880 --> 01:55:32.880]  And they're pretty much protecting this place like Fort Knox, and it's just crazy what's happening.
[01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:37.880]  I've been actually traveling all over Europe the last couple days, and I've been in France.
[01:55:37.880 --> 01:55:39.880]  I've been in Spain covering major protests.
[01:55:39.880 --> 01:55:44.880]  And I have to say, people in France, people in Spain, they all heard of the Bilderberg group.
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:46.880]  I've talked to random people on the streets.
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:48.880]  I've talked to people at protests.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.880]  Many people know what the Bilderberg group is.
[01:55:50.880 --> 01:55:53.880]  Many people are sick of the left and right paradigm.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:55.880]  Many people just want to be left alone.
[01:55:55.880 --> 01:55:56.880]  They want these big banksters.
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:55:58.880]  These big banksters that are here secretly meeting.
[01:55:58.880 --> 01:56:00.880]  They want them out of their lives.
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:02.880]  They don't want all their money to go to them.
[01:56:02.880 --> 01:56:03.880]  They want freedom.
[01:56:03.880 --> 01:56:04.880]  They want liberty.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:11.880]  And I was shocked and amazed to see the true spirit, the true ideas that we've been pushing forward for many years now,
[01:56:11.880 --> 01:56:13.880]  so alive here in Europe.
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:22.880]  There's such a disconnect between us and the Europeans, the Americans, and the people over here have so many interests, so many goals in common.
[01:56:22.880 --> 01:56:24.880]  I mean, we're all just people overall.
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:26.880]  We all just want the same thing in life.
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:27.880]  We just want to be left alone.
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:29.880]  We want life, liberty, and freedom.
[01:56:29.880 --> 01:56:32.880]  And these people here are suffering just like we are here.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:36.880]  I was in Paris, France, in Steele Square, covering the major camp-off protests,
[01:56:36.880 --> 01:56:43.880]  where hundreds, if not thousands of protesters were tear-gassed or beaten by French police officers
[01:56:43.880 --> 01:56:48.880]  just because they wanted to camp out in their square to show solidarity with the Spanish movement.
[01:56:48.880 --> 01:56:49.880]  Yeah, of course.
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:53.880]  We reported the bomb scare yesterday where, you know, our car was parked at the top of the hill,
[01:56:53.880 --> 01:56:57.880]  and the chief of police told Aaron that nobody would be allowed into the area.
[01:56:57.880 --> 01:56:58.880]  Not the same chief.
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:01.880]  Not the same chief of police who came to this event tonight.
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:07.880]  And Charlie Skelton of the London Guardian put out a report this morning where he got a photograph
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:13.880]  which was taken by one of the activists of the man who was arrested for the apparent bomb scare
[01:57:13.880 --> 01:57:19.880]  where the police were talking about some kind of tube-like device that was found in that location
[01:57:19.880 --> 01:57:21.880]  just across from the Bilderberg Hotel.
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:27.880]  Now, most of the activists that we've spoken to had never seen this guy before and couldn't identify him,
[01:57:27.880 --> 01:57:35.880]  but according to Alex of Info Creek, it turns out that he was a member of a neo-fascist organization,
[01:57:35.880 --> 01:57:42.880]  and as Alex has just said to me now, you know, you would think that he would agree with what Bilderberg had been inside the hotel,
[01:57:42.880 --> 01:57:58.880]  but definitely some kind of provocateur action was in evidence yesterday.
