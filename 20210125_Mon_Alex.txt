[00:00.000 --> 00:22.000]  It's Monday, January 25th, the year is 2021.
[00:22.000 --> 00:25.240]  I am Alex Jones, your host of Instroyers, about to take over.
[00:25.240 --> 00:30.960]  I'll be joining in the transmission in about 30 minutes live from the road.
[00:30.960 --> 00:33.440]  Well, the big question is, are we under martial law?
[00:33.440 --> 00:38.560]  That's what outgoing Hawaiian Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbards just asked Joe Biden.
[00:38.560 --> 00:41.680]  And the answer is, of course we are, but it's not Joe Biden's martial law.
[00:41.680 --> 00:43.240]  He's the figurehead.
[00:43.240 --> 00:48.760]  It is the UN, Davos Group, world government, reset.
[00:48.760 --> 00:53.120]  All these unpopular governments that were hanging on by fraud in France, in Germany,
[00:53.120 --> 00:58.320]  in Spain, and other areas, they have all used the ongoing lockdowns as their pretext
[00:58.320 --> 00:59.320]  for control.
[00:59.320 --> 01:04.120]  And as I predicted six months ago, the lockdowns would be extended over and over again.
[01:04.120 --> 01:09.360]  And then once they stole the election from Trump, they would then morph the medical martial
[01:09.360 --> 01:13.080]  law, which is physical martial law already on the streets, into a permanent military
[01:13.080 --> 01:14.080]  martial law.
[01:14.080 --> 01:15.080]  This is all part of normalization.
[01:15.080 --> 01:18.520]  They had a forced economic global collapse.
[01:18.520 --> 01:23.080]  They want to put us onto a guaranteed universal income so they can dictate every aspect of
[01:23.080 --> 01:24.080]  our lives.
[01:24.080 --> 01:26.720]  And now what we predicted decades ago was official.
[01:26.720 --> 01:31.440]  Once they make everybody go on welfare, that's what this is, then they can make you all take
[01:31.440 --> 01:35.840]  whatever inoculations they want of gene therapies and aren't even vaccines that will then, of
[01:35.840 --> 01:39.680]  course, give you cancer, sterilize you, whatever the globalists want.
[01:39.680 --> 01:40.680]  This is next level.
[01:40.680 --> 01:44.840]  And once the media and the culture goes along with this, it'll be too evil to fail, just
[01:44.840 --> 01:50.120]  like autism, hundreds of millions of people have gotten sick from the vaccines conservatively.
[01:50.120 --> 01:56.360]  But once the public goes along with the cover-up, it becomes too evil to fail, a term I've coined.
[01:56.360 --> 01:59.640]  So I'll be on in 30 minutes with Owen laying all of this out.
[01:59.640 --> 02:00.640]  Yes, it's despotic.
[02:00.640 --> 02:01.640]  Yes, it's scary.
[02:01.640 --> 02:02.640]  Yes, it's depressing.
[02:02.640 --> 02:07.400]  But folks, now understand, I didn't say all this stuff just to scare you.
[02:07.400 --> 02:08.880]  I didn't make this stuff up.
[02:08.880 --> 02:13.080]  And I talked about this in a special report we're going to put out later today, but in
[02:13.080 --> 02:18.760]  secret rulers of the world that came out over 20 years ago, Harry Shearer, of course,
[02:18.760 --> 02:24.240]  of Spinal Tap, some of the other great movies, but also The Simpsons, was talking about listening
[02:24.240 --> 02:27.440]  to me over shortwave radio, this family, and how it was some of the best science fiction
[02:27.440 --> 02:35.320]  stuff you'd ever heard, some of the best writing, and that I was basically a masterful fiction
[02:35.320 --> 02:36.320]  writer.
[02:36.320 --> 02:37.600]  No, I'm not Stephen King.
[02:37.600 --> 02:40.360]  I'm covering what the globalists had in white papers.
[02:40.360 --> 02:42.480]  It sounds unbelievable.
[02:42.480 --> 02:43.480]  Now it's out in the open.
[02:43.480 --> 02:45.760]  Somebody told you this was going on 20 years ago.
[02:45.760 --> 02:46.760]  You wouldn't believe it.
[02:46.760 --> 02:49.600]  But they were setting it all up, they were planning it, they were laying it all out.
[02:49.600 --> 02:54.760]  And so going along with it only puts you in more jeopardy.
[02:54.760 --> 02:57.200]  Biden is striking out, of course, to ruin the military.
[02:57.200 --> 03:01.400]  He's striking out to ruin women's sports, and he's striking out to just overturn all
[03:01.400 --> 03:05.600]  basic common sense and teach us the two plus two does not equal four.
[03:05.600 --> 03:09.080]  It equals whatever they say will also be laying all of that out.
[03:09.080 --> 03:11.080]  But focusing on Biden is really a distraction.
[03:11.080 --> 03:13.360]  You have to focus on who controls him.
[03:13.360 --> 03:18.800]  The Davos Group is now meeting as we speak, plotting their next power grab, and only becoming
[03:18.800 --> 03:23.080]  aware of this global order and the controllers, do we have any shot at turning the tide against
[03:23.080 --> 03:24.080]  them.
[03:24.080 --> 03:26.600]  All right, back to Owen Schroer, the online transmission, and I'll see you coming up
[03:26.600 --> 03:28.080]  at the bottom of the hour.
[03:28.080 --> 03:32.960]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, a lot developing here today.
[03:32.960 --> 03:38.960]  We're going to have all the latest breaking news for you on the Alex Jones show, all
[03:38.960 --> 03:43.160]  the latest breaking news at infowars.com.
[03:43.160 --> 03:50.760]  There is one unifying presence in America today, and that's nobody likes Joe Biden.
[03:50.760 --> 03:51.880]  Nobody likes Kamala Harris.
[03:51.880 --> 03:58.640]  Only the most brainwashed mainstream media, mainstream entertainment stooges can even
[03:58.640 --> 04:05.480]  stand Joe Biden and Kamala Harris being in the White House.
[04:05.480 --> 04:12.080]  And of course, voters remorse for Joe Biden is already off the charts.
[04:12.080 --> 04:16.640]  And of course, we're seeing what Joe Biden was really all about.
[04:16.640 --> 04:26.720]  And that's the China first, China first new world order.
[04:26.720 --> 04:32.080]  Lawmakers are coming after Trump supporters, coming after military vets, and they now even
[04:32.080 --> 04:42.040]  want to rewrite the military and purge all Trump supporters or conservatives from the
[04:42.040 --> 04:43.040]  military.
[04:43.040 --> 04:51.600]  They are now proposing that legislation in Congress as we speak as Biden surpasses 30
[04:51.600 --> 04:55.960]  executive orders, a record most executive orders in a president's first week.
[04:55.960 --> 05:00.800]  That's an authoritarian.
[05:00.800 --> 05:03.480]  Alex Jones here with some very, very good news.

[06:24.040 --> 06:30.040]  January 25, 2021, this is the Alex Jones show.
[06:30.040 --> 06:32.720]  Owen Troyer here sitting in for Alex.
[06:32.720 --> 06:40.520]  We are going to be hearing from Alex throughout the broadcast, including live in T-minus 25
[06:40.520 --> 06:42.520]  minutes.
[06:42.520 --> 06:52.880]  Well, if you wanted to hurt the United States, if you wanted to permanently do damage to
[06:52.880 --> 07:04.840]  the United States and weaken it, or say you were a global power like China, and you wanted
[07:04.840 --> 07:12.400]  a New World Order to be in your favor, in your dominance, you would have to do something
[07:12.400 --> 07:17.000]  about the United States of America.
[07:17.000 --> 07:22.000]  And if you could, you'd want to weaken the military, you'd want to weaken the culture,
[07:22.000 --> 07:28.600]  you'd want to divide the people, you'd want to get the people to hate their own history,
[07:28.600 --> 07:33.840]  their own culture, hell, their own skin color, you would propagandize the youth, you would
[07:33.840 --> 07:39.640]  buy up the Hollywood celebrities and entertainers, you would buy up all the major sports leagues
[07:39.640 --> 07:40.840]  so you could control that.
[07:40.840 --> 07:45.120]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, that is the formula that is being used right now by China, plus
[07:45.120 --> 07:47.880]  many other factors.
[07:47.880 --> 07:50.560]  They don't have any limits on their pollution.
[07:50.560 --> 07:55.400]  They don't have any minimum wage, they have slave labor, so they get all the advantages
[07:55.400 --> 08:05.800]  and then you, the American in the free market that industrialized the West, ended slavery,
[08:05.800 --> 08:10.720]  liberated women, no, see, you're the bad guy.
[08:10.720 --> 08:13.720]  You have to pay for it all.
[08:13.720 --> 08:21.200]  And now you don't even get to elect a president, China just gets to install whoever they want
[08:21.200 --> 08:29.000]  and in this case, that someone is Joe Biden, but you see Biden doesn't even know what's
[08:29.000 --> 08:30.000]  going on.
[08:30.000 --> 08:36.720]  You notice you don't see much from Joe, you don't hear much from Joe, Joe's day is pretty
[08:36.720 --> 08:39.320]  low energy.
[08:39.320 --> 08:44.240]  He rolls out of bed, maybe around eight, if he can do it, if he can hack it that day.
[08:44.240 --> 08:48.840]  They pump him up with meds, they get him all rolled up, they tell him what's going on,
[08:48.840 --> 08:51.160]  he kind of has to open it, huh?
[08:51.160 --> 08:59.360]  Okay, Joe, it's time to get dressed, it's time to get ready, Joe.
[08:59.360 --> 09:08.200]  He puts on his suit, he gets his tie, he gets all ready, and then he gets shuffled over
[09:08.200 --> 09:14.240]  to the desk, he gets shuffled over, he gets guided to the desk where they have a stack
[09:14.240 --> 09:19.800]  of executive orders and then two microphones and he sits down and he signs the executive
[09:19.800 --> 09:26.320]  orders and then he goes to the podium and reads a speech that he has no idea what it's
[09:26.320 --> 09:36.320]  about and then he calls a lid because he needs more meds, he needs more attention and quite
[09:36.320 --> 09:40.520]  frankly, he's just drained of energy.
[09:40.520 --> 09:45.840]  And so that's Joe Biden.
[09:45.840 --> 09:52.480]  That's the New World Order puppet, that's the Chinese-owned operative who, yes, got
[09:52.480 --> 10:03.480]  locked out of the White House in symbolic fashion in natural, real-world irony, locked
[10:03.480 --> 10:08.040]  out of the White House because it's not his, so he had to break and enter into the White
[10:08.040 --> 10:15.320]  House because he doesn't belong there.
[10:15.320 --> 10:17.520]  Isn't that wild?
[10:17.520 --> 10:23.520]  But if you were the Chinese Communist Party puppet in the White House, what would you
[10:23.520 --> 10:24.520]  do?
[10:24.520 --> 10:27.560]  Well, there'd be two things on your agenda.
[10:27.560 --> 10:37.880]  You'd want to make us energy dependent, oh, Biden did that, canceled all federal drilling
[10:37.880 --> 10:44.600]  or oil deals, canceled the Keystone Pipeline and then had it send it out on Warren Buffett's
[10:44.600 --> 10:52.240]  train lines straight over to China, way to go, Joe.
[10:52.240 --> 10:57.280]  So you'd make us energy dependent, you'd ship our energy out, let other countries have it
[10:57.280 --> 11:03.040]  like China instead of bringing it here when we already built the pipeline and had the
[11:03.040 --> 11:04.640]  deal done.
[11:04.640 --> 11:11.280]  And then you would weaken the military, which now the Democrats are moving on two fronts
[11:11.280 --> 11:15.840]  right now, Joe Biden signs an executive order, it's time for transgenders to be back in the
[11:15.840 --> 11:29.680]  military, hurrah, it's time for the trannies to be back in the military, we can't be bigoted
[11:29.680 --> 11:30.680]  here.
[11:30.680 --> 11:32.960]  Oh, you don't even know what gender you are, you don't know what sex you are, eh, sounds
[11:32.960 --> 11:42.320]  great, get in, you're hired, frontline infantry, in fact, forget about that, you're just a general.
[11:42.320 --> 11:48.960]  No military experience, we're going to call you gender transitional general, in fact it's
[11:48.960 --> 12:00.200]  a new post now, the gender bending general, gender bending general appointed by Joe Biden.
[12:00.200 --> 12:05.920]  And if you actually look at the executive orders 30 plus now, three or four of them are transgender
[12:05.920 --> 12:12.440]  stuff, most of them are just China first, eliminating America first policy from Trump,
[12:12.440 --> 12:18.640]  they got about 15 COVID nonsensical ones, again, he doesn't even know what's going on,
[12:18.640 --> 12:23.440]  he just sits down at the desk, there's a stack of executive orders, he just signs them.
[12:23.440 --> 12:27.120]  I mean, talk about how dangerous.
[12:27.120 --> 12:32.840]  We don't even have a president, ladies and gentlemen, the United States of America doesn't
[12:32.840 --> 12:39.760]  currently have a president, and our Congress is bought off and paid for, the media is bought
[12:39.760 --> 12:43.240]  off and paid for.
[12:43.240 --> 12:49.560]  And now that China knows Biden's on the leash with them, they're moving into Taiwan, they're
[12:49.560 --> 12:56.480]  moving into Hong Kong, they're expanding in the South China Sea, they're getting in battles
[12:56.480 --> 13:03.440]  with India at the border, oh yeah, now Walmart's canceling all their deals for Made in America
[13:03.440 --> 13:08.720]  products are buying from China, headline from CNN, foreign companies are giving up on the
[13:08.720 --> 13:18.920]  United States and betting big on China, the China stock market's on the rise, yeah.
[13:18.920 --> 13:26.680]  So what would you do if you wanted to weaken America, well, you'd do exactly what Joe Biden
[13:26.680 --> 13:29.080]  is doing.
[13:29.080 --> 13:41.560]  You would do to a T what Joe Biden is doing, in fact, it's already having disastrous effects
[13:41.560 --> 13:44.240]  on people's lives.
[13:44.240 --> 13:53.600]  And so here is a one of the men who was working on the Keystone Pipeline in clip four talking
[13:53.600 --> 14:01.720]  about how Joe Biden has already cost them hundreds of jobs.
[14:01.720 --> 14:12.360]  The numbers of jobs are thousands of jobs, there's Michaels, there's precision pipeline
[14:12.360 --> 14:16.240]  that would have affected that the pipeline was going to be constructed.
[14:16.240 --> 14:19.880]  The actions that were happening, recently we were doing station work, there's hundreds
[14:19.880 --> 14:23.200]  of guys that got laid off with it, Tuesday.
[14:23.200 --> 14:25.800]  Are any living in Wisconsin?
[14:25.800 --> 14:30.640]  Yes, a lot of them live in Wisconsin, yes.
[14:30.640 --> 14:35.760]  Now there were so many jobs in the oil industry under President Trump, they couldn't even
[14:35.760 --> 14:38.560]  hire enough people.
[14:38.560 --> 14:42.480]  These are jobs starting at like 70 K a year.
[14:42.480 --> 14:47.960]  Biden just said no more of that.
[14:47.960 --> 14:59.600]  Oh, we've got a booming energy industry, we've got a booming oil industry.
[14:59.600 --> 15:05.520]  And he gets up on the podium, reads off his little teleprompter, we got to do what's best
[15:05.520 --> 15:07.880]  for American workers.
[15:07.880 --> 15:13.560]  We got to get people back to work, we're going to fix this economy.
[15:13.560 --> 15:21.760]  Oh, you thousands, tens of thousands in the oil industry, screw you.
[15:21.760 --> 15:26.880]  We will, oh, we won't ban fracking, we will ban fracking, we won't ban fracking, we won't
[15:26.880 --> 15:37.840]  ban fracking, we did ban fracking, oh, and now, imagine this, you're President of Guatemala,
[15:37.840 --> 15:43.560]  Honduras, Belize, you get a phone call, United States, what's this?
[15:43.560 --> 15:49.440]  Yeah, this is, someone calling on behalf of Joe Biden, he wants to offer you $4 billion
[15:49.440 --> 15:50.440]  for what?
[15:50.440 --> 15:51.440]  Which one to give it to you?
[15:51.440 --> 15:52.440]  For real?
[15:52.440 --> 15:56.440]  Mexican leader says Joe Biden offered $4 billion for Central America, just called him up and
[15:56.440 --> 15:57.440]  said, hey, you want some money?
[15:57.440 --> 15:58.440]  Not for you though.
[15:58.440 --> 16:01.920]  Hey everybody, confused about staying healthy in a crazy COVID culture?
[16:01.920 --> 16:02.920]  Me too.
[16:02.920 --> 16:07.080]  But listen, after all the research, all the conflicting studies, after all the squabbling,
[16:07.080 --> 16:11.920]  there's one thing almost everyone agrees on, it's that immune system health can literally
[16:11.920 --> 16:14.200]  be the difference between life and death.
[16:14.200 --> 16:17.120]  You probably already believe that, I certainly do.
[16:17.120 --> 16:21.440]  So here's the thing, I wanted to get past the craziness and find out which plant-based
[16:21.440 --> 16:26.520]  substances actually have studies that demonstrate some efficacy in immune support.
[16:26.520 --> 16:32.360]  Now, you'll have to sign a waiver, but you can check out what I've discovered at strongerdefence.com.

[21:28.040 --> 21:29.880]  But I was told

[21:31.880 --> 21:35.200]  That this is likely to sell out today. I
[21:37.160 --> 21:43.040]  Was told to let you know that vitamin mineral fusion is likely to sell out today and

[22:20.600 --> 22:23.360]  We get another supply in
[22:23.360 --> 22:27.880]  All right, so you've got the Democrats
[22:29.200 --> 22:31.200]  allied with the Chinese communists
[22:32.520 --> 22:37.920]  Who have completely cucked the Republican Party made the Republican Party their bitch and
[22:38.640 --> 22:41.840]  So now they are bringing in the Communist
[22:42.960 --> 22:46.080]  Agenda into this entire planet
[22:46.920 --> 22:50.240]  Through the West like a vaccine because if they can defeat
[22:50.240 --> 22:57.320]  The free market in the West if they can defeat the rugged individual in the West in the United States of America then Chinese
[22:58.480 --> 23:04.080]  Totalitarian communism can go world-wide and that's of course the agenda for the one-worlds government
[23:04.840 --> 23:08.160]  The UN the World Health Organization you're already getting a taste of that
[23:09.240 --> 23:10.480]  with
[23:10.480 --> 23:12.480]  COVID
[23:13.240 --> 23:16.120]  And so remember though Biden
[23:17.720 --> 23:19.440]  said that
[23:19.440 --> 23:23.560]  Trump doesn't know what he's doing as soon as Biden gets in he's gonna have it under control
[23:23.560 --> 23:27.520]  He knows what he's doing day one. He's gonna have the virus under control. That was his thing
[23:27.520 --> 23:31.960]  I'll have the virus under control. I'll have the virus under control. I'll have the virus under control
[23:32.560 --> 23:37.720]  But then yesterday he came out and made a statement during a press conference, and I guess he forgot
[23:38.400 --> 23:40.400]  his own campaign issue
[23:40.680 --> 23:42.680]  Because here's what he said yesterday
[23:42.680 --> 23:50.280]  If we fail to act there will be a wave of evictions and foreclosures in the coming months
[23:51.200 --> 23:57.320]  As this pandemic rages on because there's nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic in the next several months
[23:58.280 --> 24:01.520]  Nothing we can do to change the trajectory of the pandemic now
[24:02.280 --> 24:04.280]  He said he'd be in control
[24:04.400 --> 24:07.800]  He said he'd get it under control. All you had to do was vote Biden. You didn't know
[24:07.800 --> 24:13.200]  Oh, but maybe you did you just vote Biden and then COVID magically under control
[24:13.920 --> 24:15.920]  Of course, that was a lie
[24:18.000 --> 24:20.600]  And it's funny watching all these people squirm about
[24:21.920 --> 24:27.640]  The Biden voters remorse, which there's not much of because there weren't there wasn't much of a Biden vote anyway
[24:28.080 --> 24:32.960]  But for those that did oh, they're getting it real real fast and they're seeing Americans lose their jobs
[24:32.960 --> 24:39.480]  And you know, they are going to try to set Biden up for success with the reopening of the economy
[24:40.640 --> 24:42.640]  in fact
[24:43.360 --> 24:45.360]  Gavin Newsom California Psycho
[24:46.280 --> 24:49.440]  Says that he's finally gonna lift the home
[24:50.840 --> 24:56.720]  House arrest that everyone was under he put everyone under house arrest. He's a good commie a
[24:57.600 --> 24:59.280]  good dictator
[24:59.280 --> 25:01.280]  Destroyed the economy but see oh
[25:03.760 --> 25:06.280]  You can open it back up and they'll show all of these
[25:06.960 --> 25:13.880]  Surges in the economy and it'll be oh my gosh Biden. Oh, oh, you can just see the media gushing and
[25:15.240 --> 25:17.240]  It's not even
[25:17.360 --> 25:23.720]  Legitimate they closed the economy for a year and then they reopen it. It'll be all Biden is so great
[25:23.720 --> 25:30.120]  No, you just reopened the economy you could have done it a year ago. Just look at South Dakota, perhaps the best example
[25:30.560 --> 25:34.200]  Unemployment rate went down went down
[25:34.840 --> 25:37.720]  South Dakota unemployment rate went down in
[25:38.520 --> 25:42.960]  2020 why because they never closed no pandemic there either
[25:44.680 --> 25:47.120]  But there are some developments in the fake pandemic
[25:48.040 --> 25:49.640]  This is a hoot
[25:49.640 --> 25:54.360]  China now claims that the coronavirus pandemic started in a US lab
[25:54.360 --> 25:56.360]  Well, I guess technically, they're right
[25:56.840 --> 25:59.000]  It did start in a lab in North Carolina
[25:59.400 --> 26:03.880]  But it was then sold to China by Obama and Fauci
[26:04.440 --> 26:09.240]  Or maybe it wasn't even sold in fact, I don't even know if they got money for that research, but they did transfer it
[26:10.360 --> 26:14.600]  So that was Fauci and Bill Gates little baby and Obama just had to sign off on it
[26:14.600 --> 26:17.960]  And so Gates and Fauci successfully moved it over to
[26:19.080 --> 26:23.560]  Wuhan there it is right there put it back up and we had the guest
[26:24.360 --> 26:26.360]  Dr. Francis Boyle that explained this
[26:27.640 --> 26:32.920]  A year ago. In fact, probably almost a year ago to today. Maybe maybe almost maybe around 11 months
[26:33.720 --> 26:38.840]  So once again in fours next year's news today and it's so funny because now everybody's admitting it you turn into mainstream news
[26:38.840 --> 26:43.320]  They show the Wuhan lab this Wuhan lab that so everybody knows what's going on
[26:43.320 --> 26:46.280]  Lab that so everybody knows it came out of the Wuhan lab now
[26:47.240 --> 26:50.760]  And but now China is going to shift the blame
[26:51.960 --> 26:53.960]  And say no, it was you
[26:53.960 --> 26:55.960]  Which there is an element of truth to
[26:56.120 --> 27:00.920]  We didn't release it onto the world and then caused the collapse of the global economy. They did that
[27:02.440 --> 27:04.040]  But
[27:04.040 --> 27:07.640]  It was created in a lab in North Carolina run by Fauci
[27:08.120 --> 27:10.440]  and of course Gates had the interest of transferring it because
[27:10.440 --> 27:12.440]  He wants to uh
[27:13.400 --> 27:15.400]  Run all the vaccines
[27:16.840 --> 27:21.240]  So anything that they're going to release, you know, he needs to know what's up so he can have the vaccine
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  And then how about this one?
[27:26.360 --> 27:31.880]  Dr. Anthony Fauci is the highest paid employee in the entire u.s federal government
[27:34.600 --> 27:36.440]  And of course
[27:36.440 --> 27:40.520]  We know that his 2019 salary was four hundred and seventeen thousand dollars
[27:42.920 --> 27:44.920]  And they say oh he made
[27:45.000 --> 27:50.120]  Uh four hundred thousand dollars more than president trump. Well president trump didn't make anything. He donated
[27:50.840 --> 27:52.840]  all of his salary
[27:53.640 --> 27:55.480]  so
[27:55.480 --> 27:59.160]  That dirt bag that naked roll man met rat man
[27:59.160 --> 28:06.920]  Anthony Fauci highest paid government who killed the u.s economy the highest paid government in amera government employee
[28:07.480 --> 28:09.480]  killed our economy
[28:10.040 --> 28:13.240]  And that rat is still going on tv and now he says
[28:14.120 --> 28:19.720]  We need to assume that the british virus strain is going to cause more damage so more fear mongering
[28:20.440 --> 28:22.440]  to kill the economy
[28:22.440 --> 28:24.440]  from the big pharma
[28:25.560 --> 28:27.560]  Anti-freedom
[28:27.560 --> 28:29.560]  Nazi tyrant anthony fauci
[28:32.120 --> 28:34.120]  The highest paid federal employee
[28:34.920 --> 28:39.960]  Who put you out of a job the highest paid federal employee who cost you your business
[28:40.280 --> 28:45.400]  The highest paid federal employee that destroyed the u.s economy anthony fauci
[28:45.960 --> 28:48.200]  He should pay every cent of that back
[28:48.200 --> 28:57.000]  Plus he actually probably owes america about five hundred billion dollars. Maybe even a trillion. Let's let's fork it over fauci
[28:58.120 --> 29:03.720]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.880]  And now that all the lies are being revealed
[29:08.600 --> 29:10.600]  What will you do?
[29:11.320 --> 29:14.440]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing
[29:14.440 --> 29:19.240]  They will do whatever they are told as if obedience is a virtue
[29:19.800 --> 29:24.120]  It is the patriots of the world versus everybody else
[29:25.320 --> 29:31.720]  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the constitution of the united states
[29:32.120 --> 29:38.840]  Against all enemies foreign and domestic that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same

[30:32.600 --> 30:39.400]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle the first evil and stopping

[34:01.420 --> 34:05.260]  Welcome ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for joining us on this worldwide broadcast
[34:06.220 --> 34:09.420]  Here we are already january 25th 2021
[34:10.140 --> 34:14.300]  Owen shroyer is back in the austin info wars news center. I am in
[34:14.940 --> 34:17.660]  utah spending some time with family
[34:17.660 --> 34:19.660]  Here in god's country
[34:20.220 --> 34:25.420]  But obviously wild horses couldn't drag me away. There's a point. I've been to make a lot the last few months on air
[34:25.420 --> 34:27.420]  But I've never really gotten to it. So I'm gonna make it right now
[34:28.860 --> 34:30.860]  Almost every morning. I wake up
[34:31.820 --> 34:34.380]  And I've had a good night's rest. I feel good
[34:35.660 --> 34:37.660]  And then I get hit
[34:37.660 --> 34:42.540]  Like with a ton of bricks that oh my gosh, we're inside the new world order. We're inside the great reset
[34:43.180 --> 34:46.220]  And it's only gonna get worse until humanity stands up and takes action
[34:46.220 --> 34:49.260]  It's kind of like, you know, you wake up. You remember you got a family member in the hospital
[34:49.260 --> 34:51.260]  You wake up. You feel good. You remember the bad news
[34:51.820 --> 34:54.780]  You wake up. You're in a good mood. You remember your girlfriend just broke up with you two days ago
[34:55.660 --> 34:59.260]  This is a hundred times worse than that. And so I don't want to be the bearer of bad news
[35:00.460 --> 35:05.260]  But the attitude out there of not admitting how much trouble we're in is what is going to allow this to get a lot worse
[35:06.220 --> 35:08.220]  We are in the middle
[35:08.220 --> 35:12.220]  Of a scientific global government takeover designed to collapse the economy
[35:12.220 --> 35:17.100]  And bring in a post-industrial world for 99 percent of the world population
[35:17.820 --> 35:21.020]  They have a lot of excuses a lot of reasons are doing this, but the end of the day. It's all about
[35:22.300 --> 35:27.180]  Raw power. These are not guardians of the earth guardians of the galaxy guardians of god's creation
[35:27.180 --> 35:30.780]  These are really really ruthless people that don't follow any of the rules they want for us
[35:33.180 --> 35:37.980]  And the fact is the world is repudiating global government and repudiating corporate governance
[35:37.980 --> 35:43.420]  It's the opposite of free market capitalism. It's a crony capitalist communist fascist model that you see in china
[35:43.420 --> 35:45.420]  It's the model of the world
[35:45.900 --> 35:49.100]  And that journey doesn't come from china. It was set up and designed in china
[35:49.660 --> 35:55.500]  In consultation with the chinese communist by david rocker feller george roper walker bush henry kissinger and others
[35:56.780 --> 36:00.140]  And it's because they've not been held accountable for any of the things they've done
[36:01.340 --> 36:04.380]  They would now put joe biden in who's incredibly unpopular
[36:04.380 --> 36:07.580]  And kamala harris who did not get one half of one percent
[36:08.700 --> 36:12.620]  Of support when she ran the democratic primaries. We'll say that again in nowhere
[36:13.820 --> 36:17.420]  Did she ever go above one half of one point? No one was that low
[36:19.420 --> 36:24.380]  But then why did cnn water well because reportedly jeff zucker has had a relationship with her
[36:26.380 --> 36:28.380]  Mets this is all about
[36:27.900 --> 36:29.900]  It's about the power trip
[36:29.900 --> 36:34.540]  Of these few elite men almost all of them white
[36:35.820 --> 36:40.700]  Telling us about how america and freedom has raised us in bad to turn all the different groups against each other
[36:41.260 --> 36:43.260]  Collapse the third world with the covet 19 lockdowns
[36:44.300 --> 36:46.300]  Flood us with third world populations that happen to be brown
[36:46.940 --> 36:50.860]  While teaching them to hate white people that hate america even though they're fighting to get here
[36:52.060 --> 36:56.620]  So it's their admitted plan the u.n. Does not deny it. That's what's so frustrating about all this is
[36:56.620 --> 36:59.100]  Info wars credibility has gone through the roof
[37:01.100 --> 37:05.420]  Because everything we told you was coming is coming exactly as we said and it keeps coming as we say
[37:06.060 --> 37:09.660]  But that is the enemy's weak point. It's not that we're that good
[37:10.780 --> 37:12.780]  It's that the enemy is so organized
[37:13.340 --> 37:16.940]  That that's their strength also their weakness if you admit that you're under globalist attack
[37:17.340 --> 37:22.860]  If you admit the massacre of fraud if you admit the vaccines of fraud if you admit everything they do is a lie
[37:22.860 --> 37:25.900]  If you admit they want to lock you down in your home and keep the borders wide open
[37:26.460 --> 37:30.460]  If you admit they're organizing the immigrant caravans if you admit that they're organizing
[37:30.780 --> 37:36.460]  Racist minority groups to attack whites all the world in knockout games and pushing people onto oncoming
[37:37.340 --> 37:44.300]  Subway trains if you admit all of this and start saying no then their whole plan falls, but if they can accelerate their assault
[37:45.580 --> 37:49.260]  Burndown cities attack you get 10.6 billion dollars of
[37:49.260 --> 37:54.620]  Public funding to sorrows is black lives matter and let these horrible globalists speak for black people and everybody else
[37:55.180 --> 37:57.180]  Then they're going to win
[37:57.820 --> 38:03.260]  But that's their strategy cloak their Chinese slave camps owned by apple in apple giving money to black lives matter cloak
[38:03.260 --> 38:07.420]  What all these other companies are doing this corrupt and bad overseas with oh we fund black lives matter?
[38:07.420 --> 38:09.420]  That's all that is is their cover
[38:09.420 --> 38:11.420]  I don't know you know that and I know that but
[38:11.980 --> 38:17.980]  They have to be repudiated for the monsters. They are for the authoritarian and the black lives matter
[38:17.980 --> 38:23.820]  For the authoritarianism they're involved in how facebook is used to steal elections all over the world for authoritarians
[38:25.020 --> 38:31.100]  How all these companies google helps round up the chinese political distance and help build that infrastructure of control
[38:31.340 --> 38:38.780]  And now they're not exporting the social credit score control grid here. The globalist built it there tested it there and are now bringing it to our shores
[38:39.900 --> 38:45.580]  Now there are legislatures getting upset. There are some governors getting upset. There's tulsi gabard saying this is martial law
[38:45.580 --> 38:47.580]  having
[38:47.820 --> 38:51.740]  The former head of the cia the head of the intelligence committee chef
[38:53.820 --> 38:57.980]  The white house press secretary saying we're going to use the military the cia
[38:58.860 --> 39:06.060]  To designate americans as terrorists for their beliefs and then disrupt their networks and shut them down disrupt networks means kill people
[39:06.940 --> 39:10.140]  Disrupt networks means not just take your bank accounts folks. It means set you up
[39:11.180 --> 39:15.020]  So and they could oh, but it's okay. We're advised by third party groups
[39:15.020 --> 39:18.300]  It's like oh, it's okay. The nazis took your neighbors away. The neighbors called on them
[39:19.820 --> 39:22.940]  Oh, it's okay. The southern poverty law center in adl said so
[39:23.100 --> 39:25.740]  So when you see the adl and southern poverty law center hate map
[39:26.620 --> 39:31.260]  Of a lot of it baptist churches pro-life groups. You name it. That's an attack grid
[39:31.740 --> 39:34.380]  That's that's where to send the bullets and the fire bombs
[39:35.020 --> 39:40.060]  Every couple days a church gets fire bombed a hispanic baptist mainline church
[39:40.540 --> 39:43.340]  That preaches basically standard southern baptist stuff
[39:43.340 --> 39:47.020]  Stuff you learn stuff. I heard in any baptist church. I went to
[39:48.140 --> 39:53.820]  Just for simply saying homosexuality is damaging and wrong. They also say infidelity's not good
[39:54.220 --> 39:56.460]  You know, I really respect people. I know that are
[39:58.700 --> 40:00.700]  Don't cheat on their wife. That's a manly thing to do
[40:02.300 --> 40:05.820]  And again, I've never claimed I'm the perfect person out here
[40:06.140 --> 40:10.540]  But the point is is that it's their right to say whether it's true whether it's not they were fire bombed last night
[40:10.540 --> 40:18.860]  And on facebook the lbg lbgt group lbgt pq xyz group that did it or was associated with it bragged about it
[40:18.860 --> 40:23.980]  They've tried to have the church shut down. These are authoritarians. They don't care if china's got three million slaves
[40:24.860 --> 40:30.460]  Just muslim slaves alone a million christians and buddhas and slave camps. They love that. They don't care if china executes homosexuals
[40:30.780 --> 40:33.340]  What they want is to go in and bully you see that catholic church
[40:34.060 --> 40:37.660]  That pro-life church had everybody run into it screaming breaking stuff last week
[40:37.660 --> 40:44.540]  A bunch of weird leftist. This is them doing their malice brigade doing their intimidation making their move
[40:45.660 --> 40:50.220]  What do you think transgender in the military is about? It's about wrecking the military
[40:50.780 --> 40:55.260]  You can't have women in frontline combat that wrecks any military. Everybody knows that well now we're gonna have
[40:56.460 --> 40:59.900]  Dudes that say they're women and women that say they're dudes and oh, don't worry though
[41:00.060 --> 41:06.380]  Maybe pull up some of those photos of all the top wrestlers and women's wrestling now are huge dudes choking out little girls
[41:06.380 --> 41:09.100]  And they even keep their testicles and genitals
[41:09.340 --> 41:13.500]  They even get to have the testosterone the women don't have because they said they're a woman
[41:14.380 --> 41:20.860]  And now they've got thousands of pervert cases a month of pervs going into bathrooms going into women's showers at ymca's
[41:21.260 --> 41:27.260]  And then and the women see a man walking with an erect penis and they they run out and cry and then why ymca says
[41:27.500 --> 41:29.500]  Hey, it's okay. He's a woman
[41:30.620 --> 41:32.620]  You know, this doesn't make sense
[41:32.620 --> 41:39.980]  It makes perfect sense. It's the sabotage of civilization. It's the takedown of civilization and what did biden say in his executive order last week
[41:40.620 --> 41:44.380]  They're not just gonna say that men can be in all women's sports
[41:45.900 --> 41:49.100]  But now because all these lawsuits and states passing laws of returning it
[41:49.740 --> 41:52.380]  He went further. He said we're gonna provide money
[41:53.260 --> 41:55.260]  for ob gyn
[41:56.220 --> 41:58.860]  full gynecological services for services
[41:58.860 --> 42:03.340]  Vaginas, uteruses and ovaries including surgeries
[42:04.060 --> 42:07.180]  To biological men that have male genitals
[42:08.540 --> 42:10.540]  Now that's that's and you go that doesn't make sense
[42:11.020 --> 42:14.540]  They have fired in the uk and the u.s nurses that will not give
[42:15.260 --> 42:19.660]  Crazy homeless men in the two cases i've seen they come in and they say give me a pap smear
[42:20.140 --> 42:26.060]  And he pulls off his underwear and the nurses responded, you know in one of the cases that he had a extremely large male genitals
[42:26.060 --> 42:29.580]  He was laughing at her at a full mustache and beard and vomiting
[42:30.620 --> 42:36.940]  That's who the globalists have unleashed as these daemons go and give me my rights be nice to me. That's called psychological rape
[42:37.420 --> 42:40.220]  That's called throwing your weight around. What do you think drag queen story time is?
[42:40.540 --> 42:44.060]  Literal videos we've shown you at schools and in other areas
[42:44.540 --> 42:50.700]  Like libraries where there's a weird fat pervert man with a big wig on and little girls and boys jumping on their genitals
[42:50.700 --> 42:57.180]  And and the weird sick women getting off on how weird it is. These are sickos who want to overturn societies
[42:57.180 --> 43:01.340]  We accept cloning and genetic engineering and cross the control of all of it
[43:01.580 --> 43:06.220]  Secure your own safe source of food supply sale. It's the new prices in 2021
[43:06.220 --> 43:10.300]  But it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at infowarstore.com

[43:42.300 --> 43:46.060]  It's all there the technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the force gmo and more
[43:46.140 --> 43:48.780]  It's time to start getting prepared it starts with self defense
[43:48.780 --> 43:51.100]  It starts with a being prepared it starts with horrible food
[43:51.100 --> 43:54.620]  It starts with digging in with a long globalist fight. You'll win in the end
[43:57.660 --> 44:02.700]  We told you it was coming under the united nations pilot program in singapore for eight months
[44:02.700 --> 44:09.260]  They've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that makes them a social distance and report them back to cell towers
[44:09.260 --> 44:12.380]  To track through every movement. This is for everybody the way it gets better
[44:13.020 --> 44:19.740]  Now france has programs in their factories government push and sponsor to make everyone wear actual dog collars
[44:20.220 --> 44:25.260]  You can make your social distance and report back to single computers. They're turning us into a commodity
[44:25.740 --> 44:29.340]  Human animal clones have been around for 50 years. It's all being announced
[44:29.420 --> 44:35.660]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations now play that they own us
[44:35.660 --> 44:40.380]  With these gene therapy systems and patents that they produced do you understand?
[44:40.380 --> 44:45.740]  It is a takeover of the entire species of the genetic level and now they're coming with dog collars
[44:45.900 --> 44:49.740]  And they're announcing in public schools in the u.s. Starting next year. It will begin
[44:50.060 --> 44:54.700]  Did you hear me dog collars for your children all based on a hoax all based on a lie
[44:55.020 --> 44:57.100]  Imple wars continue to spread the word to fight back

[47:15.500 --> 47:19.660]  Broadcasting worldwide in defense of human liberty
[47:19.660 --> 47:28.460]  Defending honor to be here folks from enemies foreign and domestic. It's alex jones
[47:29.100 --> 47:35.900]  Live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide from the info wars dot com studios
[47:37.980 --> 47:44.140]  Look at that headline on info wars dot com for tv viewers radio listeners. Please don't get it to share it breaking america now
[47:44.140 --> 47:52.140]  Officially under un directed marshal law watch live. That is not a clickbait. That is the reality and outgoing
[47:53.180 --> 47:56.380]  congresswoman from hawaii tulsi gabbert's one of the only democrats that's decent
[47:56.380 --> 48:00.780]  She's like a whole fashion democrat army veteran you name it. She came out and said this is marshal law
[48:01.580 --> 48:05.420]  And we need to decry all these democrat officials calling for literal secret police
[48:06.220 --> 48:10.140]  To be turned loose against the american people and now I was reading a CNN article today
[48:10.140 --> 48:12.780]  it's like well almost all the charges are for
[48:12.780 --> 48:18.460]  Being in a federal building unauthorized almost no one actually broke anything or did anything
[48:19.900 --> 48:21.660]  But
[48:21.660 --> 48:25.100]  That's the low-hanging fruit now the fbi is going to go after the actual organized groups
[48:25.580 --> 48:28.860]  Well, we know who the organized groups are they bragged about what they did
[48:30.060 --> 48:32.700]  And it's very suspect that nothing's happened to those groups
[48:33.580 --> 48:40.700]  Extremely suspect and I'll be talking more about that later the actual groups that planned it the actual groups that launched the first attack
[48:40.700 --> 48:44.300]  And broke down the doors and got in antifa and another group
[48:45.100 --> 48:46.860]  And then another group
[48:46.860 --> 48:50.620]  Of mainly patriots did have some infiltrators and they got suckered in as well
[48:51.020 --> 48:57.580]  So yeah, once they got a big crowd going they got out of 200 000 people a couple hundred to go inside. They've already charged 125
[48:58.380 --> 49:00.380]  But who's been charged for violence?
[49:00.540 --> 49:04.060]  The most deadly attack in u.s history world history worse than pearl harbor
[49:04.060 --> 49:09.500]  Uh, I've got a abc news clip mscbs news clip where they're comparing this to world war two
[49:10.620 --> 49:14.540]  And saying we've got to reeducate all these nazis. They're saying if you were a trump supporter
[49:15.180 --> 49:17.980]  And voted for trump you can't be in the military or federal service
[49:18.860 --> 49:24.780]  I mean, that's the real nazi germany. Oh and shroyer. You're there in the atx. This isn't about us tuning our horn
[49:24.780 --> 49:26.860]  It's about listeners now realizing
[49:26.860 --> 49:28.860]  They want us off air not because we're lying
[49:29.180 --> 49:32.460]  But because we've told the truth and we're raising the alarm is it not incredible
[49:32.460 --> 49:36.300]  to see 100 percent tyranny in our face
[49:37.100 --> 49:42.300]  And we're not really seeing any real action against it. It's with a totally unpopular chi-com agent president
[49:43.260 --> 49:45.260]  Moving to shut down the economy completely
[49:45.660 --> 49:51.180]  Uh, obviously stole the election, you know, the good news is people didn't actually vote this guy in but oh, that's the big evil
[49:51.180 --> 49:55.180]  You're not allowed to say that even though democrats said we will not accept trump when he wins
[49:55.660 --> 49:59.500]  We will fight all the way through and we will have our own government and secede
[49:59.500 --> 50:05.580]  That was in the new york times that john podesta was advising democrats to secede and break the country up and have a civil war
[50:05.740 --> 50:07.740]  but oh my gosh
[50:07.740 --> 50:09.740]  some provocateurs broke into the capital and
[50:10.300 --> 50:13.580]  four citizens died and then a cop died of a heart attack and
[50:14.060 --> 50:15.340]  to
[50:15.340 --> 50:17.340]  brain damage or something that
[50:18.060 --> 50:21.260]  They can't even say he actually died from this but now they're saying a stroke or heart attack
[50:21.660 --> 50:25.740]  But again the most deadly thing in history free speech is gone. We've got to arrest all the patriots
[50:25.740 --> 50:31.180]  So they're probably law center attack maps a deal attack maps, you know where they put a red dot on your church your business
[50:31.180 --> 50:37.420]  Your bookstore burn it down attack attack go to the family research council start firing your weapons attack attack
[50:37.740 --> 50:41.260]  I mean, that's the real group's doing this. Oh and well imagine if
[50:41.820 --> 50:47.020]  The democrats were actually honest about what they were doing and this is why we haven't really seen any pushback
[50:47.660 --> 50:50.540]  On a mass scale because the media is in their pocket and they're not honest
[50:50.540 --> 50:57.100]  Four years ago if the democrats would have said we're the media even it's one of the same would have said anybody who supports trump
[50:57.100 --> 50:59.100]  We're gonna politically
[50:59.180 --> 51:02.780]  Persecute you we're gonna try to put you in jail. We're gonna try to end your business
[51:02.780 --> 51:06.780]  We're gonna come after your family. We're gonna come after people would have been like what what is going on?
[51:07.020 --> 51:09.820]  But now here we are if the democrats are being honest, they would say all right
[51:09.820 --> 51:11.820]  look we're at war with america
[51:12.060 --> 51:14.060]  biden's working for china and
[51:14.620 --> 51:17.660]  We want to put you in jail. We want to throw you in jail. We want to end your business
[51:17.660 --> 51:20.780]  You don't want you have banking so they're just not honest and that's why we don't have the pushback
[51:21.340 --> 51:24.700]  These people are at war with us alex. They want us in debt
[51:25.180 --> 51:31.260]  They want us enslaved and they want us with nothing no property. No assets. No family. No speech. No guns nothing
[51:32.140 --> 51:35.980]  That's right. This is a globalist multinational takeover. They've been setting up for decades. It's here
[51:36.300 --> 51:40.460]  We warned you but the good news is it's so illegal and so corrupt. We can stop it
[51:40.460 --> 51:43.340]  Don't believe them when they say you're not allowed to question an election
[51:43.340 --> 51:48.140]  Don't believe them when you you're allowed to say that the joe biden isn't your president whether that was right or wrong
[51:48.140 --> 51:50.380]  It's your right to say it, but it's it's actually true
[51:51.020 --> 51:53.660]  Here's tolsey gabbert's on two different fox news programs
[51:54.300 --> 51:57.740]  Saying what republicans and others should be saying and we're not hearing much on
[51:58.300 --> 52:00.300]  White House press briefings not just brennan
[52:00.700 --> 52:05.900]  Repeating four days after brennan said this on on monday on friday. This press secretary said yes
[52:05.900 --> 52:12.780]  We're going to arrest people for their views. The cia is watching you total attempt intimidation. Well, guess what?
[52:13.900 --> 52:15.900]  The globalists couldn't beat the north vietnamese
[52:16.700 --> 52:19.900]  And the globalists can't beat their jihadis. They actually run themselves
[52:20.220 --> 52:23.420]  So they actually want to get going down that road and that war
[52:24.220 --> 52:28.380]  There's not gonna be a war against the actual military. They try to send for us. It's gonna be that very military
[52:28.620 --> 52:34.220]  I guarantee you in the final equation that's going to deal with the cia leftist communist scumbags giving them those orders
[52:34.220 --> 52:39.740]  They are literally pushing us into war. Biden started all these new wars. These are criminals
[52:39.740 --> 52:45.180]  These are maniac psychos ladies and gentlemen, and they really want blood because they've never actually been in a fight
[52:45.420 --> 52:51.420]  They all want to play soldier like they're playing risk our dungeons and dragons. Hey liberals. This isn't dungeons and dragons dumbasses
[52:51.660 --> 52:53.820]  This isn't dungeons and dragons you dumb schmucks
[52:54.940 --> 52:57.740]  All right, let's go ahead and go to tulsey gabbert's
[52:57.740 --> 53:03.340]  Are you surprised they're pushing forward with this extra surveillance on would be domestic terror?
[53:05.260 --> 53:12.140]  It's so dangerous, you know as you guys have been talking about this is an issue that all democrats republicans independence libertarians should be
[53:12.780 --> 53:14.780]  Extremely concerned about
[53:14.780 --> 53:19.180]  Especially because we don't have to guess about where this goes or how this ends
[53:19.580 --> 53:23.020]  When you have people like former cia director john brennan
[53:23.020 --> 53:30.380]  And openly talking about how he's spoken with uh or heard from appointees and nominees in the biden administration
[53:30.380 --> 53:32.780]  Who are already starting to look across our country?
[53:33.660 --> 53:35.660]  for these types of movements
[53:35.820 --> 53:38.540]  similar to the insurgencies they've seen overseas
[53:39.100 --> 53:42.620]  that in his words he says make up this unholy alliance of
[53:43.580 --> 53:45.580]  religious extremists
[53:45.900 --> 53:50.540]  Racists bigots. He lists a few others and adds at the end even
[53:50.540 --> 53:56.300]  Libertarians so when you look at their process and they start looking at okay
[53:56.300 --> 54:02.140]  How do what characteristics are we looking for as we're building this profile of a potential extremist?
[54:02.700 --> 54:05.500]  What are we talking about a religious extremist? Are we talking about?
[54:05.900 --> 54:11.260]  Uh christians evangelical christians. What is it? What is a religious extremist? Is it somebody who's pro-life?
[54:11.420 --> 54:13.980]  I mean what where do you where do you take this?
[54:14.620 --> 54:18.540]  You start looking at okay. Well, obviously you have to be a white person obviously
[54:18.540 --> 54:21.980]  Likely male libertarians. Well if anybody who?
[54:23.260 --> 54:28.540]  Back to sub 10 seconds. She's reading directly what they said of course communists are never on the list
[54:29.180 --> 54:32.620]  Of course socialists anti for that actually burned down whole neighborhoods and police stations
[54:32.860 --> 54:34.780]  They're never on the list, but again, we don't want them on the list
[54:34.940 --> 54:38.940]  You don't use the pentagon on the cia against domestic groups. You use the fbi
[54:39.260 --> 54:44.300]  By the way, the fbi is not even asking for these powers. This is the left demanding all of this. Let's continue
[54:44.300 --> 54:50.540]  Inside their house or uh people who you know attended a trump rally
[54:51.500 --> 54:59.180]  Once you start walking this down the path you see where it leads to a very dangerous undermining of our civil liberties
[54:59.660 --> 55:04.860]  Our freedoms in our constitution and a targeting of almost half of the country
[55:05.500 --> 55:09.100]  So congresswoman we saw some really disgusting pictures of
[55:09.100 --> 55:17.100]  Brave men and women who traveled from across the country to protect the capital sleeping on cement sleeping in parking garages
[55:17.500 --> 55:19.500]  Not having anywhere to go to the bathroom
[55:19.980 --> 55:21.980]  I just felt so terrible
[55:21.980 --> 55:27.980]  Especially because of the fact we did they really need to be there in in in that large number
[55:29.900 --> 55:34.140]  Now first of all it made me so angry to see all of these different images
[55:34.140 --> 55:39.340]  Uh coming from national guard soldiers really posting the reality of the situation that they were in
[55:39.900 --> 55:46.060]  Being shoved into the parking garage that's freezing cold all strewn about lying on the ground
[55:46.380 --> 55:48.620]  Really being discarded as though they don't even matter
[55:48.940 --> 55:53.740]  Meanwhile, as you said our troops national guard soldiers some of whom I've served with you know
[55:53.820 --> 55:59.020]  200 came from hawaii went to washington dc answered that call to serve like everybody else
[55:59.900 --> 56:01.900]  Only to be mistreated
[56:01.980 --> 56:03.740]  in this way
[56:03.740 --> 56:08.380]  No to answer your question the militarization of our nation's capital
[56:09.420 --> 56:16.220]  Was was not only unnecessary. Yes, we need to make sure that this transition of power happens peacefully and safely
[56:16.860 --> 56:21.420]  But to send that message both to the american people and to the world
[56:22.060 --> 56:29.820]  That somehow our nation's capital is is under attack and threat of of a siege of of of taking over
[56:29.820 --> 56:35.100]  Uh, I just don't think that's the message that we want to send to the american people and to the world
[56:35.420 --> 56:39.020]  Especially as we we conduct this peaceful transition of power
[56:41.340 --> 56:46.940]  And everybody wanted to have beefed up security. We're not saying they didn't need security. Okay, that's enough. She went shut down
[56:47.980 --> 56:52.620]  These are both like timid long interviews. They're both on info wars.com. Now the headline is
[56:53.340 --> 56:56.860]  Tulsi gabbards asked joe biden. Are we under marshal law? Well, that's like
[56:56.860 --> 57:01.820]  That's like asking the blue sky. Is it a blue sky? Yes, the the covid is marshal law
[57:02.380 --> 57:04.380]  This this is introducing
[57:04.380 --> 57:09.340]  Tyranny to you and now in blue states they put it according to computers just like they do in europe
[57:09.740 --> 57:15.740]  What can be open? What can't and they arbitrarily decide it's total power. It's called a technocracy. We're gonna go to break
[57:15.740 --> 57:19.820]  I'm gonna spend some more time with oan. They'll be taking over the rest of the transmission today
[57:20.220 --> 57:25.660]  Please don't forget vitamin o fusion will be sold out today and I've kept it discounted. There it is. It's great for your immune system

[57:51.500 --> 57:54.140]  You need to try it. I've tried turbo force with everything
[57:54.140 --> 57:59.740]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy. I put turbo force in my coffee. That was a crazy week
[57:59.740 --> 58:05.180]  I don't I don't remember sleeping but as far as the products go turbo force is my favorite and all the info wars products are down to
[58:05.500 --> 58:07.500]  Taking control your life taking control your health
[58:08.460 --> 58:10.460]  Not relying on other people to do it for you
[58:11.340 --> 58:13.340]  Nobody wakes up in the morning
[58:14.140 --> 58:17.420]  And thinks i'm gonna give that person over there a better life. I'm gonna wake up today
[58:17.420 --> 58:22.220]  You know, I'm gonna spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier happier and richer
[58:22.220 --> 58:25.980]  I'm gonna make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend. I don't think that happens very often
[58:25.980 --> 58:29.500]  It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said tate. You're such a good guy
[58:29.660 --> 58:34.140]  How can I improve your life in every single way? There's only one person who woke up and thought that and that was me
[58:34.220 --> 58:37.180]  I woke up and thought you know what? Okay. I want to take control of my life
[58:37.260 --> 58:41.020]  I want to take control of my health and that's why you need to go to info wars.com take control of your health right now
[58:41.020 --> 58:47.260]  And support the resistance don't buy into the group think don't drink the kool-aid drink the turbo force kool-aid's bad and the turbo force is good
[58:47.260 --> 58:52.620]  President trump won in a landslide on November 3rd, but the globalists weren't gonna let that happen
[58:53.580 --> 58:56.700]  They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement
[58:57.500 --> 59:02.540]  Imitating from the united states that spread across the world from the uk to brazil
[59:03.580 --> 59:06.700]  They were desperate. They admitted their own publications. They didn't know what to do
[59:07.980 --> 59:11.340]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots violated state law
[59:12.380 --> 59:14.380]  And stole it better than dollars
[59:14.380 --> 59:17.580]  And now they're coming after the president. They're coming after you. They're coming after me
[59:17.980 --> 59:21.420]  They're shutting everybody off the internet. They're trying to totally censor us
[59:21.980 --> 59:25.340]  And that's why info wars is still in the fight because we knew this was coming
[59:25.900 --> 59:32.700]  We told you this was coming. We were the first main target that we're still on air at info wars.com and do is wars.com and band on video

[59:48.860 --> 59:51.580]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[59:55.580 --> 59:58.060]  We have any john bound reports big brother
[59:58.940 --> 1:00:00.940]  Mainstream media
[1:00:01.180 --> 1:00:04.540]  Government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny?
[1:00:05.100 --> 1:00:07.100]  Well, so does he
[1:00:07.500 --> 1:00:09.500]  live
[1:00:09.500 --> 1:00:14.540]  Live from the info wars.com studios. It's alex jones
[1:00:18.540 --> 1:00:20.540]  These hand gentlemen
[1:00:21.180 --> 1:00:24.540]  We are back live we are broadcasting worldwide
[1:00:25.020 --> 1:00:28.140]  I'll be here till the bottom of the hour and then Owen shroyer is going to take over but
[1:00:28.620 --> 1:00:31.420]  Oh, and I've got a bunch of topics that I want to cover the next few segments
[1:00:31.420 --> 1:00:33.340]  I know you've got a lot of the same topics to cover but
[1:00:33.820 --> 1:00:37.260]  Something separate. I know the crew can pull up for not this segment, but the third segment
[1:00:37.260 --> 1:00:42.460]  Is mert just got out of the vaccine business. They just got out of the cova 19
[1:00:43.340 --> 1:00:45.820]  Saying that theirs isn't effective and it doesn't work
[1:00:46.380 --> 1:00:50.780]  Uh, and well, of course, it doesn't work. You can't produce something for the common cold
[1:00:51.180 --> 1:00:56.780]  They just manipulated the common cold where they can get their own separate test for the common cold to own the common cold
[1:00:57.020 --> 1:01:01.340]  And lock down the country using the common cold. We've we've broken the code of what they're doing
[1:01:01.820 --> 1:01:03.820]  meanwhile, uh, madernum
[1:01:04.060 --> 1:01:05.420]  and Pfizer
[1:01:05.420 --> 1:01:11.660]  Have liability protection. So they're all just lying but it's coming out that this is not giving people any immunity to cover 19
[1:01:11.660 --> 1:01:16.620]  Or any other cold viruses for that matter and it's actually causing major health problems and major deaths
[1:01:17.260 --> 1:01:21.900]  Uh, I mean, uh, this is uh, incredible. Hank erin died after getting his second shot
[1:01:22.700 --> 1:01:24.700]  and uh
[1:01:24.780 --> 1:01:27.340]  Media matters a taxes saying hey, this probably happened from the shot
[1:01:27.580 --> 1:01:30.220]  Well, we got a whole bunch of old folks dying from the shot. You have the british government
[1:01:30.220 --> 1:01:36.700]  Saying don't give it to people above 75, but then they still do it. I mean, this is this is really murderous information
[1:01:37.420 --> 1:01:41.420]  And I wonder what it feels like to be media matters and be trying to suppress
[1:01:42.620 --> 1:01:44.860]  Suppress that this is hurting old people. That's sick
[1:01:46.220 --> 1:01:50.380]  Well, you know alex, it's the whole it's it's it's the same approach to everything
[1:01:50.780 --> 1:01:56.220]  Everything is destructive. It destroys the human will it destroys the human spirit. It destroys our freedoms
[1:01:56.220 --> 1:02:01.820]  But I mean the covet thing is dying. I think right in front of our face alex, uh, you know, every time I go out
[1:02:01.820 --> 1:02:03.820]  I'm seeing more and more resistance to the mask
[1:02:04.540 --> 1:02:10.060]  Every time I go out. I'm hearing more and more people, you know, make cracks about the vaccine or make cracks about the mask
[1:02:10.540 --> 1:02:12.540]  So I think it's dead on arrival
[1:02:12.540 --> 1:02:17.740]  But really if you look at the history and and we've been covering this at info wars for decades
[1:02:17.740 --> 1:02:21.100]  If you look at the history they even admit alex the flu vaccine doesn't even work
[1:02:21.100 --> 1:02:26.140]  None of their vaccines work. The hpv vaccine doesn't work. It gives girls cancer
[1:02:26.140 --> 1:02:31.100]  I mean, so none of their vaccines have actually been proven to be totally safe and effective not a single one
[1:02:31.100 --> 1:02:35.100]  Let me correct you and they do work at setting a standard for big pharma
[1:02:35.420 --> 1:02:40.380]  To be above the law and be able to hurt people and get away with it and to sterilize and give people cancer and depopulate
[1:02:40.380 --> 1:02:42.620]  So they're working extremely well for their real
[1:02:43.260 --> 1:02:46.700]  Their real aim the real motive of this weapon system is is it is
[1:02:46.700 --> 1:02:51.820]  Is extravagantly successful. Well, imagine if everyone else had the same immunity
[1:02:52.460 --> 1:03:00.460]  To litigation that big pharmaceutical companies had or specifically vaccine manufacturers had. I mean they basically I mean alex if you went in
[1:03:01.340 --> 1:03:03.340]  And you had a doctor say, okay
[1:03:04.060 --> 1:03:07.180]  I want you to sign this waiver before you get the vaccine you say, well, okay
[1:03:07.180 --> 1:03:09.580]  What is there smart you say? Well, what is this waiver say?
[1:03:09.580 --> 1:03:15.580]  Well, this waives any any right you have that if you die or get paralyzed or can't have kids any side effects
[1:03:15.580 --> 1:03:20.140]  You have no right to sue no right to legal litigation. You just take it
[1:03:20.540 --> 1:03:24.860]  I bet you 90% of the people right there would say, you know what? No, I'm not going to take this vaccine
[1:03:24.860 --> 1:03:27.980]  Something's a little off about that, but that's what I don't see you say
[1:03:29.260 --> 1:03:32.540]  The answer is and I'm not a litigious person, but in this case I am
[1:03:33.260 --> 1:03:35.820]  Sue Walgreens sue cbs sue the doctor
[1:03:36.700 --> 1:03:42.380]  Just because the vaccine maker got liability from congress that doctor doesn't and they knowingly prescribed you something that could hurt you
[1:03:42.380 --> 1:03:45.660]  That doesn't extend to them now. They're trying to extend it to doctors right now
[1:03:45.900 --> 1:03:49.580]  So they'll carry out this crime, but here's the good news most doctors say it's a fraud
[1:03:49.580 --> 1:03:53.260]  I've talked to a bunch of them, but see they get censored too. Oh, and so big tech
[1:03:53.900 --> 1:03:56.220]  Is super guilty in this whole situation
[1:03:56.940 --> 1:04:02.620]  Yeah, they even went after dr. Simone gold they actually arrested her because she was in dc on january 6th
[1:04:03.180 --> 1:04:06.780]  And she was one of the first doctors to call out that hydroxychloricin works
[1:04:06.780 --> 1:04:13.900]  She actually cited Anthony Anthony Fauci's 2005 essay about hydroxychloroquine working as a prophylactic
[1:04:14.220 --> 1:04:17.740]  And a preemptive with zinc and vitamin d and and other
[1:04:18.460 --> 1:04:23.340]  Vitamins and minerals so I mean they know all this and it really just shows how sick they are with Anthony Anthony Fauci
[1:04:23.340 --> 1:04:27.980]  Now we've we learned the highest paid federal employee. He should pay every dime of that back
[1:04:27.980 --> 1:04:32.140]  I mean this guy is a criminal whether it's worse. So and I totally agree. Oh, by the way
[1:04:32.140 --> 1:04:37.740]  Is biden gonna give his uh paycheck like trump does back don't don't hold your breath. These are greedy people
[1:04:37.740 --> 1:04:40.700]  Even though biden's worth hundreds of millions, but but let's expand on that
[1:04:41.260 --> 1:04:44.220]  Fauci owns part of four of the vaccines with bill gates
[1:04:44.860 --> 1:04:47.740]  But the new york times just goes to conspiracy theory. He's on record
[1:04:48.220 --> 1:04:51.340]  It's on retting as you said earlier in the hour. I was listening to you about how
[1:04:51.980 --> 1:04:56.940]  Uh, he did the chinese who said this came from a us lab because the wuhan was a us lab
[1:04:56.940 --> 1:05:02.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history. I've interviewed all the experts
[1:05:02.860 --> 1:05:08.940]  I have looked at every facet of this and now the only days until the inauguration of the chi-com agent
[1:05:09.420 --> 1:05:12.780]  It's all coming into place. That's how they change the subject from election fraud
[1:05:12.860 --> 1:05:15.180]  It's how they change the subject from hunter's laptop
[1:05:15.340 --> 1:05:21.900]  It's how they change the subject from epstein and obama and al-qaeda and the new world order and
[1:05:21.900 --> 1:05:29.100]  Now use the already marshal law in place for covet 19 and that's what it is to then be expanded and become political
[1:05:29.820 --> 1:05:33.500]  And become permanent. They train you to stay in your houses. They train you to be tracked
[1:05:33.740 --> 1:05:38.300]  They train and do what you're told for nine ten months his training wheels and now they launch the storm
[1:05:38.700 --> 1:05:40.700]  The storm is here
[1:05:40.860 --> 1:05:42.620]  It's a globalist storm
[1:05:42.620 --> 1:05:44.620]  There's not gonna be marshal law for trump
[1:05:44.700 --> 1:05:48.140]  There's to be marshal law for the globalist. They're trying to set you up
[1:05:48.140 --> 1:05:53.580]  Don't be involved in violence expose the new world order and expose the takeover with information
[1:05:53.740 --> 1:05:55.820]  That's how we beat these people with truth
[1:05:58.220 --> 1:06:02.300]  Big brother mainstream media government cover-ups
[1:06:03.020 --> 1:06:11.100]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he live from the info wars dot com studios. It's alex jones
[1:06:11.100 --> 1:06:18.380]  We are back live. Oh and shroyer is in the main news center in austin texas
[1:06:18.380 --> 1:06:20.940]  I'm alex jones coming to you from the beautiful mountains
[1:06:21.500 --> 1:06:27.660]  Of utah spend some time with my family, but we are here obviously tracking the latest developments as they unfold
[1:06:27.900 --> 1:06:29.900]  The best way to describe things is
[1:06:30.140 --> 1:06:33.180]  A total collapse in the confidence system of america
[1:06:34.220 --> 1:06:39.500]  A total collapse of morals a total collapse of the regulatory systems a total collapse of the fbi
[1:06:39.500 --> 1:06:43.340]  Uh, just a multinational corporate looting of the country
[1:06:43.980 --> 1:06:49.740]  Uh, covet at every level is a fraud is a lie paid for by fouchy and bill gates on record
[1:06:50.140 --> 1:06:53.900]  At the chapel hill facility in north carolina until the scientists made a big deal about it
[1:06:54.300 --> 1:06:57.900]  2015 it was a top news story at hundreds of scientific journals
[1:06:58.460 --> 1:07:00.460]  Uh, even in newsweek
[1:07:00.620 --> 1:07:02.620]  They were doing illegal gain of function
[1:07:03.260 --> 1:07:05.500]  Uh, super spreader type garbage
[1:07:05.500 --> 1:07:13.100]  People go well is it deadly or is it not it's a vaccine ingredient live virus to put in vaccines to test as a simulant
[1:07:13.580 --> 1:07:15.580]  Four more deadly chimeras
[1:07:15.580 --> 1:07:21.500]  So so so they're developing treatments for really deadly chimera covet viruses that you know probably have five 10 15 20
[1:07:21.500 --> 1:07:24.220]  Percent death rates, which I know they've made in labs. They admit they have
[1:07:24.780 --> 1:07:27.180]  So this is a simulant. We caught them 10 years ago
[1:07:27.980 --> 1:07:31.660]  Uh putting out, uh that particular flu the h1n1
[1:07:31.660 --> 1:07:36.060]  A couple years before it actually popped up. They put it out as a simulant live virus
[1:07:37.420 --> 1:07:41.340]  In the vaccines to then track vaccine spread all of this
[1:07:43.340 --> 1:07:45.340]  Is mad scientist testing
[1:07:45.820 --> 1:07:47.820]  And so we know there were at least 11
[1:07:48.220 --> 1:07:53.180]  Major studies for hundreds of millions of dollars a year at the wuhan facility because china's where you go
[1:07:53.500 --> 1:07:58.940]  If you want to create animal human clones or if you want to create augmented humanoid clones or if you want to
[1:07:58.940 --> 1:08:03.980]  Produce cows that produce human milk or goats that produce spider
[1:08:05.260 --> 1:08:07.260]  Web that can be used for body armor
[1:08:07.820 --> 1:08:09.420]  everything I mentioned
[1:08:09.420 --> 1:08:12.700]  Was admitted by china and in major scientific publications
[1:08:14.140 --> 1:08:17.820]  26 seven years ago when I was first on air
[1:08:18.540 --> 1:08:25.340]  It was in scientific publications that they had spider goats. They had human animal hybrids. They had human z's
[1:08:25.340 --> 1:08:28.540]  They had pigs that were basically pure muscle that were part human
[1:08:29.420 --> 1:08:32.380]  They had humans growing inside pigs humans growing inside cows
[1:08:32.780 --> 1:08:34.780]  But it was all in the literature
[1:08:34.860 --> 1:08:38.060]  Like admitted going on in argentina of all places
[1:08:38.700 --> 1:08:41.100]  Uh in uh, costa rica of all places
[1:08:41.660 --> 1:08:43.420]  in communist china
[1:08:43.420 --> 1:08:45.420]  in singapore
[1:08:45.420 --> 1:08:51.900]  That's where they admittedly were doing it. Um, they had bases though just like they have torture black sites all over the world
[1:08:51.900 --> 1:08:53.900]  They have bases
[1:08:55.260 --> 1:09:01.500]  Underground bases all over the western world doing stuff way advanced in that and like I told you it's industrial scale
[1:09:01.660 --> 1:09:06.380]  It's like say my dad worked in a steel mill. They tried to hire my dad. It was one of the first guys doing implants
[1:09:06.860 --> 1:09:09.740]  Uh, and he taught implants at baylor university
[1:09:10.300 --> 1:09:12.060]  Uh, they tried to recruit him and it wasn't just him
[1:09:12.140 --> 1:09:19.900]  They were trying to recruit a lot of the top dentist in dallas and oral surgeons to go live in maryland at a site r
[1:09:19.900 --> 1:09:21.900]  basically it was it was near site r
[1:09:21.980 --> 1:09:27.260]  Uh and uh create cyborgs and and and they told my dad that I mean they didn't tell him the rest
[1:09:27.740 --> 1:09:30.700]  I forget the exact stuff. I was like eight years old when he was talking about with my mom
[1:09:30.940 --> 1:09:34.700]  He was he could pay 400 something thousand dollars back to that'd be like three million dollars a year
[1:09:35.340 --> 1:09:37.100]  uh to
[1:09:37.100 --> 1:09:41.500]  Go in months at a time into an underground base and then come back out out of the base, okay?
[1:09:41.660 --> 1:09:47.580]  So that's I don't know how old was I when I was like what year was I like eight years old? I was born in 1974
[1:09:47.580 --> 1:09:52.140]  So I guess that'd be like 1982 1983
[1:09:54.220 --> 1:09:56.220]  And a lot of my dad's friends went
[1:09:56.780 --> 1:09:58.780]  And they went they moved to maryland. They went to an underground base
[1:09:59.260 --> 1:10:03.740]  And did god knows what in planning things in bone. That's all they were told cyborg cybernetics
[1:10:04.540 --> 1:10:11.020]  And so again, you go see movies like terminators of these underground bases all the stuff going on that's actually going on, okay?
[1:10:12.220 --> 1:10:17.420]  And the globalists are tired of hiding this they're tired of hiding the human animal hybrids or they get definitely got stuff
[1:10:17.420 --> 1:10:21.500]  Basically like replicants, but it here's the thing it doesn't create the super humans like they said
[1:10:21.900 --> 1:10:27.180]  It creates all sorts of medical problems and total mental illness and there's just something wrong with these people
[1:10:28.060 --> 1:10:31.900]  That's what the transgenderism is about is if you'll accept a man being in women's sports
[1:10:32.220 --> 1:10:36.860]  Or you'll accept a man with male genitals going to the doctor and saying he needs a pap smear
[1:10:38.140 --> 1:10:42.620]  If you will accept all of that well, then you'll accept these clones. They're gonna start telling you about
[1:10:42.620 --> 1:10:47.980]  Oh, it's billy the first human clone his parents both had genetic disorders, but they deserve a child
[1:10:48.380 --> 1:10:54.060]  So this major biotech company combined their genetics and fixed it and he's the first humanoid
[1:10:54.300 --> 1:10:56.460]  But it does he of course he has rights
[1:10:57.980 --> 1:11:04.060]  And once you say that humanoid has rights well now the corporations can produce whatever they want and whoever they want
[1:11:04.780 --> 1:11:07.660]  Okay, and so that's the end of it. This is a giant
[1:11:08.300 --> 1:11:10.300]  science race into the future
[1:11:10.300 --> 1:11:17.580]  To do gene therapy on you. These are not vaccines. These mRNA are reprogramming your DNA reprogramming yourselves
[1:11:18.620 --> 1:11:20.620]  to control you and
[1:11:21.420 --> 1:11:27.260]  So when I had a lockdown and showed you robots at the baseball games and the football games the basketball games and the soccer games all dancing
[1:11:27.420 --> 1:11:30.460]  While you're locked up. They're telling you the age of humans is over
[1:11:31.260 --> 1:11:35.180]  Because the globalists want you to roll over. They want you to die. They want you to not know how to run a farm
[1:11:35.420 --> 1:11:38.620]  Or not know how to run a ranch or not how to run an auto parts store
[1:11:38.620 --> 1:11:43.820]  Or or an auto repair place all the new cars. You can't work on them. Everything's going to be driverless
[1:11:44.220 --> 1:11:48.140]  And and and this event 201, which is what you're seeing now great the great reset
[1:11:48.700 --> 1:11:53.740]  Is the beta test for the big real bio attacks that are coming and I told you that 12 months ago and it started
[1:11:53.980 --> 1:11:57.420]  Bill Gates four months later went on co-bearant said this is a drill
[1:11:58.060 --> 1:12:00.060]  Tariffs are about to release a real bio weapon
[1:12:00.940 --> 1:12:05.420]  Somebody thinks oh, we're going to get out of the mask. It's going to be okay. We'll get a little COVID tracking
[1:12:05.420 --> 1:12:10.780]  You know store master flying and some people will have these COVID passports. It's it's whatever it's convenient
[1:12:11.420 --> 1:12:14.700]  And then they hit you with a big bio weapon and really locked your ass down
[1:12:15.260 --> 1:12:16.860]  And then this time hundreds of millions dying
[1:12:16.860 --> 1:12:19.260]  It's a real weapon and then the next time billions die
[1:12:19.340 --> 1:12:24.220]  But you've all learned how to stay locked down how to behave and not get out of control while they kill you
[1:12:24.540 --> 1:12:27.340]  So that's what the martial law is about is what the global government's about
[1:12:27.500 --> 1:12:31.660]  It's getting you all locked down and prepared ahead of this happening and look. I'm sorry. This is so scary
[1:12:31.660 --> 1:12:36.700]  But this is their admitted plan so you can live into now all day long the age of humans is over
[1:12:37.100 --> 1:12:42.300]  That's why they're destroying the military. That's why it's going all robot. That's why they're destroying the family
[1:12:42.540 --> 1:12:47.420]  This is the shutdown of humanity and I could sit here all day and talk about joe biden super unpopular and
[1:12:48.380 --> 1:12:53.180]  Joe biden can hardly talk and you know his his hot mic saying I don't even know what I'm signing and you know
[1:12:53.180 --> 1:12:58.460]  While he signed executive orders and while he signed executive orders. There's a hot mic about yeah, I did my plea bargain deal
[1:12:58.460 --> 1:13:06.380]  You've got a bunch of compromised chinese communist agents in there the bureaucracy loves it because it can now literally make deals
[1:13:06.700 --> 1:13:09.980]  While using biden as the fall guy to sell america out
[1:13:10.700 --> 1:13:16.540]  And and then that further demoralizes america. You see the chinese troops all marching in lockstep at their parades all the exact
[1:13:16.860 --> 1:13:23.580]  Hundreds of thousands of them ggping not a citizen in sight like the hunger games and you see our events total squalor
[1:13:23.580 --> 1:13:28.620]  No one there to see biden troops laying around and heaps everywhere congresswoman saw
[1:13:29.180 --> 1:13:34.060]  troops asleep without mask on came over and bitched at them like dogs had them thrown out
[1:13:34.380 --> 1:13:39.900]  Because it's all about demoralizing you it's all about running you down. It's all about making you feel like you're pathetic
[1:13:40.860 --> 1:13:46.860]  Instead of absolutely never wearing the mask never submitting to them speaking up everywhere saying no
[1:13:47.340 --> 1:13:51.820]  Telling doctors the way you take a vaccine. Okay, you sign a liability form getting aggressive
[1:13:51.820 --> 1:13:58.380]  Outside of violence. That's what it's going to take and violence isn't the answer here because the public's too dumbed down about who the real enemy is
[1:13:58.940 --> 1:14:00.940]  We have to take our culture back
[1:14:01.260 --> 1:14:05.180]  We have to absolutely not support the global thing more. That's how we're going to win
[1:14:05.420 --> 1:14:09.740]  Oh, and i'm ranting here. I'm going to do one more segment with you and cover some other important topics, but
[1:14:10.540 --> 1:14:14.060]  How surreal is it to see all of this unfolding and then going into overdrive?
[1:14:14.060 --> 1:14:19.900]  Well, I didn't think we'd we'd witness it this fast. I mean people always ask, oh, when is it going to get that bad?
[1:14:19.900 --> 1:14:25.180]  I figured it would be more of the next generation that we're going to have to face this but they're really bringing all the
[1:14:25.580 --> 1:14:30.380]  They're bringing all the heat on us right now and and my biggest fear. I think watching the kovid
[1:14:30.860 --> 1:14:36.780]  Roll out worldwide is exactly what you're talking about. It was just a test. They just tested something that wasn't deadly
[1:14:36.780 --> 1:14:38.780]  Maybe they have a deadly agent. Maybe they don't
[1:14:38.780 --> 1:14:42.780]  But it was a test and they get all the testing worldwide so they can see how effective it is
[1:14:42.780 --> 1:14:46.780]  They can see how it spreads a whole mass test. They can see how easy you'll lock down
[1:14:46.780 --> 1:14:50.060]  Which areas are easier which are how to spread it all of this stuff
[1:14:50.780 --> 1:14:55.820]  But you know the surrealness is it's like we had to do tornado drills in Missouri when we were in school
[1:14:55.820 --> 1:14:58.460]  And so we do a tornado drill maybe every other month or something
[1:14:58.780 --> 1:15:03.900]  And and you'd go to a designated hallway or whatever in the basement and you'd get down and you'd crouch down
[1:15:03.900 --> 1:15:06.700]  That'd be the tornado drill. Well, that would be like
[1:15:07.420 --> 1:15:09.900]  They have a tornado drill and it's sunny outside
[1:15:09.900 --> 1:15:12.940]  And you know a couple of your classmates are actually panicked. Oh my gosh
[1:15:13.500 --> 1:15:15.500]  tornado
[1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:18.620]  You're like, hey, it's just a drill like no reason and that's like the whole world
[1:15:18.940 --> 1:15:24.140]  It's like this whole drill of a pandemic that's not even happening and yet they're crying
[1:15:24.620 --> 1:15:29.660]  Screaming out in total panic over over a drill over a test. That's not even real
[1:15:30.380 --> 1:15:32.700]  Well, that's because people are primed that if they're a victim

[1:20:11.500 --> 1:20:13.500]  Two big articles
[1:20:14.140 --> 1:20:17.500]  Two big articles on infowars.com ron paul
[1:20:18.140 --> 1:20:21.740]  But fascism comes it will be wearing a mask very important article
[1:20:21.740 --> 1:20:27.100]  Another one gretchen whitmer the mass killer governor that sent the
[1:20:27.820 --> 1:20:31.180]  Covid positive patients to the one place that might kill somebody old folks homes
[1:20:32.540 --> 1:20:36.140]  She's come out and said that she can't stand people that have one rule for others
[1:20:36.540 --> 1:20:41.180]  But different one for themselves and once anyone arrested not social distancing not wearing a mask
[1:20:41.740 --> 1:20:45.980]  Or out in public even though she goes out on boats when she's not supposed to or tries to
[1:20:45.980 --> 1:20:52.620]  She doesn't wear a mask in public. She doesn't social distance because it's okay because she's a globalist just like the governor
[1:20:53.660 --> 1:20:58.860]  Of new york just like the governor of california. These people are piles of evil trash
[1:20:59.980 --> 1:21:01.980]  Who flaunt all of this?
[1:21:03.100 --> 1:21:04.860]  In your face
[1:21:04.860 --> 1:21:11.100]  Oh, and there is so much news to cover so many issues to hit. I've got a few final points that I want to hit
[1:21:11.980 --> 1:21:13.740]  here, but
[1:21:13.740 --> 1:21:16.540]  What else do you have coming up? Tell folks what you've got coming up after our leave
[1:21:17.100 --> 1:21:20.140]  Well, we've got uh the davos forum that is
[1:21:20.700 --> 1:21:27.980]  Meeting right now. That's a totally anti american group of globalist elites working on ways to defeat our free market
[1:21:28.300 --> 1:21:33.340]  You have all the evidence now of joe biden. I mean forget about the trees and he committed before
[1:21:33.740 --> 1:21:38.140]  He's just committing open trees and now right in the white house, but i'm not even sure if he knows what's going on
[1:21:38.140 --> 1:21:39.740]  He even admits
[1:21:39.740 --> 1:21:45.100]  Unwittingly in his own videos when signing the executive orders. He might not even know he's on camera. He just says what am I signing?
[1:21:45.100 --> 1:21:46.940]  I don't know what i'm signing
[1:21:46.940 --> 1:21:51.260]  And then of course you have the democrats now targeting alex any trump supporter
[1:21:52.380 --> 1:21:59.260]  And they say any trump supporter can be labeled domestic terrorist any trump supporter should not be allowed to join the military
[1:22:00.220 --> 1:22:03.660]  And they want to send us to reeducation camps and gulags
[1:22:04.540 --> 1:22:06.540]  There are a few republicans fighting back
[1:22:06.540 --> 1:22:11.420]  Uh, but it's not enough and then you of course have the race baiting of the mainstream media continuing
[1:22:11.420 --> 1:22:13.420]  But you know alex you said something earlier
[1:22:13.980 --> 1:22:19.100]  About how you go to bed and you sleep well and it's like oh you wake up feeling refreshed and then it hits you about the new world
[1:22:19.100 --> 1:22:24.060]  Order i'm like the opposite i'll like go through a day with like gallows humor of having it all
[1:22:24.620 --> 1:22:26.620]  And then i lay in bed at night
[1:22:26.780 --> 1:22:31.980]  And i'm just like is this the last night i get to lay in my bed is this the last night i get to have a pillow under me
[1:22:31.980 --> 1:22:34.540]  Is this the last night i'm not sleeping on a cold heart cement
[1:22:34.540 --> 1:22:36.940]  Uh before they haul us off to gulags. I mean
[1:22:37.660 --> 1:22:41.900]  It's uh, it's a creeping thing, but as we see it moves. Let me just agree with you there
[1:22:41.980 --> 1:22:44.540]  Let me just agree with you. I was laying in bed last night
[1:22:45.100 --> 1:22:49.420]  This means they're talking about putting this in prison for political views and saying they're going to do it
[1:22:49.740 --> 1:22:52.780]  And i'm literally laying there going man this bed's comfortable compared to a prison bed
[1:22:52.780 --> 1:22:56.380]  But this is going to burn itself out these crazies are already turning on each other
[1:22:57.100 --> 1:23:01.180]  They're not as well organized as the soviets of the nazis were they have more power
[1:23:01.180 --> 1:23:05.100]  They have more high tech, but they're not this is not going to go to what the way they want
[1:23:05.420 --> 1:23:09.500]  They're their previous power grabs led to giant populist awakenings
[1:23:10.060 --> 1:23:12.860]  And huge landslides against them. So now they've had to steal elections
[1:23:13.660 --> 1:23:18.940]  Provocator our big event so that they could make millions or a million people look bad with a few hundred bad apples
[1:23:19.260 --> 1:23:22.220]  And then call it the new pearl harbor when they only killed four of us
[1:23:22.860 --> 1:23:26.540]  Uh, and then one cop died of a stroke and heart attack a two days later. We're still sorry for him
[1:23:26.540 --> 1:23:32.060]  Um, uh people see through this and so as bad as it is folks hold the course keep speaking out
[1:23:32.460 --> 1:23:37.180]  They can't get all of us. They can't get one percent of us. Yes for people like alex jones and own shroyer
[1:23:37.900 --> 1:23:39.260]  democratic party
[1:23:39.260 --> 1:23:42.700]  And the rigged court systems are suing the hell out of us with the aim to shut us down
[1:23:43.100 --> 1:23:45.740]  That's why buying our products spreading the word now
[1:23:47.020 --> 1:23:52.940]  Allows us to stay strong in the face of this and allows us to develop contingency operations and other things
[1:23:52.940 --> 1:23:56.940]  Okay, so believe me what you see going on on the surface is is most what we're doing
[1:23:57.180 --> 1:23:59.340]  There's a lot of stuff going on behind this the surface
[1:23:59.740 --> 1:24:04.300]  I need everyone to go to m4 store.com and I know it's sold out the trader joe's shirt
[1:24:04.300 --> 1:24:09.340]  We only ordered 2 000 to don't be popular. Uh, they sold out like a day or two. We're putting that on a waiting list
[1:24:09.580 --> 1:24:13.100]  It's made in america more come in next week. We're ordering 10 000 now
[1:24:13.580 --> 1:24:15.740]  Trader joe with joe biden on the front
[1:24:15.740 --> 1:24:22.060]  That shirt's there go buy a tyranny response team shirt go buy a mass murderers agree gun control work shirt and listen
[1:24:23.100 --> 1:24:28.060]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula is 95 percent cumanoid. It's a powdered tablet. It's amazing people love it
[1:24:28.140 --> 1:24:34.060]  It's an m4 store.com. We have the liquid turmeric extract. It's incredible as well. That is still massively discounted
[1:24:34.140 --> 1:24:37.260]  It's going to sell out by this weekend, but I'm keeping it discounted
[1:24:38.140 --> 1:24:39.420]  massively as well
[1:24:39.420 --> 1:24:44.780]  I told you because it's such an amazing liquid multivitamin and mineral with amino acids that we would keep
[1:24:44.780 --> 1:24:47.660]  Uh, that product on sell sold out. It's selling out today
[1:24:48.140 --> 1:24:51.820]  vitamin mineral fusion at m4store.com
[1:24:52.140 --> 1:24:54.940]  But whatever you do now look at that pure turmeric extract
[1:24:55.580 --> 1:25:02.700]  100 percent 100 percent reviews ladies and gentlemen at m4store.com get in there get our
[1:25:03.340 --> 1:25:05.420]  Bodies get our liquid turmeric as well
[1:25:05.980 --> 1:25:09.260]  But also get super metal vitality and if there's one thing you take
[1:25:09.260 --> 1:25:15.660]  I would take the x2 of the x3 the true deep breath crystal iodine the missing link even the un admits on wikipedia
[1:25:15.660 --> 1:25:20.620]  That over 2 billion people have mental disabilities or lower cognitive function because of lack of iodine
[1:25:21.420 --> 1:25:23.420]  Most iodine is bound
[1:25:24.140 --> 1:25:30.940]  You don't absorb it when it's in food and it's and most things except for uh, seafood that there isn't any in there
[1:25:31.580 --> 1:25:35.980]  This stuff is amazing. If you simply take it it will change your life. I know it's changed my life
[1:25:35.980 --> 1:25:39.420]  And it's also essential to your metabolic system and immune system
[1:25:39.900 --> 1:25:41.900]  x3 has the deep breath crystalline as well
[1:25:42.300 --> 1:25:46.300]  Scientists explained to us that some people very low percentage can't absorb pure iodine
[1:25:46.460 --> 1:25:48.620]  Just like most folks can't absorb bound iodine
[1:25:48.940 --> 1:25:52.620]  So this has the deep breath crystal iodine and two other types of high quality iodine
[1:25:53.180 --> 1:25:55.180]  That have been bound to something that's healthy
[1:25:55.420 --> 1:26:01.180]  Show that you can still absorb it into your cells. So different strokes for different folks some people like x3 better than x2
[1:26:01.740 --> 1:26:05.020]  I I like both of them x3 is not as strong
[1:26:05.020 --> 1:26:08.700]  It's better for children consult a physician before you take this is just no joke
[1:26:08.700 --> 1:26:15.260]  But if folks if you like the other products like bodies ultimate turmeric formula or the liquid formula or vitamin refusion get x3
[1:26:15.580 --> 1:26:19.500]  And get x2 both discounted and in full war store.com. And here's another big one
[1:26:20.540 --> 1:26:25.020]  I'm right here in utah where our big food suppliers that I forgot that they're right here in salt lake city
[1:26:25.020 --> 1:26:27.020]  And I'm up in park city
[1:26:27.340 --> 1:26:32.140]  And they're calling me saying hey come see our even bigger factories. They're bigger facilities because I was there four years ago
[1:26:32.140 --> 1:26:37.580]  And so I'm probably going to take a half a day here and go do some workcation the next few days to do a tour
[1:26:37.660 --> 1:26:39.660]  and maybe a live feed from there, but
[1:26:39.980 --> 1:26:43.580]  They had to go up in prices a little bit the competitors already went up in prices 10 months ago
[1:26:43.580 --> 1:26:47.340]  They had to go up in prices to some inflation food prices are going up for them massively
[1:26:47.580 --> 1:26:53.660]  They only went up a little bit and that's it prepare with alex.com that takes you right to a subsection of info or store.com
[1:26:54.060 --> 1:26:57.900]  Where you find the the entire spectrum of their food the lowest price you're going to find it anywhere
[1:26:57.900 --> 1:27:02.540]  Prepare with alex.com a subsection of info wars.com and I'm telling you
[1:27:03.100 --> 1:27:08.060]  The way inflation is going to heat up they don't want to go up in prices in six months. The competitors are already going up again
[1:27:09.100 --> 1:27:14.460]  I can tell you we make a very small profit off of this and so do they to be competitive and to be high quality
[1:27:15.660 --> 1:27:18.220]  Now we sell more than anybody else. They're the biggest company now
[1:27:18.300 --> 1:27:19.340]  They're only 14 years old
[1:27:19.340 --> 1:27:24.220]  They're the biggest company for four years now because they sell the highest quality best package longest lasting
[1:27:24.220 --> 1:27:29.340]  Food for the price you're going to find you can find stuff cheaper not much out there that tastes terrible
[1:27:29.740 --> 1:27:36.060]  Is horribly packaged this is super inexpensive for very decent food some of it tastes gourmet most of it tastes great
[1:27:36.300 --> 1:27:38.300]  some of it tastes okay
[1:27:38.380 --> 1:27:41.100]  But it doesn't make you get sick like some of the other horrible food out there
[1:27:41.180 --> 1:27:44.700]  So for the price and the quantity I get this is the company
[1:27:44.780 --> 1:27:46.780]  I test out a lot of companies 12 years ago
[1:27:47.340 --> 1:27:49.420]  When I got rid of some of my food sponsors that have been good
[1:27:49.420 --> 1:27:52.940]  But weren't good anymore and I got my patreon when they were only about two years old
[1:27:52.940 --> 1:27:57.740]  Got their food loved it used it for about a year and said I want you to be my sponsor
[1:27:57.980 --> 1:28:00.300]  They've now been a sponsor for 11 12 years
[1:28:00.860 --> 1:28:07.420]  Uh, and they're ready to ship. They've got the food right now go to preparatholics.com or info or store.com go to the food section
[1:28:08.060 --> 1:28:08.940]  You'll find it all there
[1:28:08.940 --> 1:28:13.580]  But I need a war chest to fight the globalist. You just saw them shut down parlor
[1:28:13.660 --> 1:28:15.980]  You see them shut down all the rest of the infrastructure folks
[1:28:15.980 --> 1:28:20.380]  I don't spend time on air because it pleases the enemy talking about this, but they are pounding us
[1:28:20.380 --> 1:28:25.100]  They are attacking us. I spend hours every day just keeping us on air
[1:28:25.340 --> 1:28:29.260]  We're like a Star Trek episode where the ship's engines going out and we're still in the fight
[1:28:29.260 --> 1:28:32.060]  We're not making a big deal about it to you, but believe me
[1:28:33.180 --> 1:28:37.020]  I need your prayer. I need your support and I need a crap ton of money
[1:28:37.260 --> 1:28:39.260]  I mean if I had 10 million dollars
[1:28:39.500 --> 1:28:42.780]  Because if you sell 10 million dollars a product if we sell 10 million dollars of food
[1:28:43.180 --> 1:28:45.180]  We get like a million dollars. Okay
[1:28:45.180 --> 1:28:48.220]  Sounds like a lot. It's not running a network like this with the supplements
[1:28:48.220 --> 1:28:51.500]  It's it's it's a bigger profit than that, but it still doesn't get I had 10 million
[1:28:51.820 --> 1:28:56.620]  I could absolutely do things you wouldn't believe and get ahead of the globalist radio listeners
[1:28:56.860 --> 1:29:03.500]  If you're concerned about the coming chaos after the november elections, this will be an extremely important message
[1:29:03.740 --> 1:29:10.860]  Here is why no matter what the outcome in november catastrophic social upheaval is a very real possibility
[1:29:10.860 --> 1:29:18.300]  Here's why this is important. Listen. We all know that silver and gold have been historic hedges against the uncertain waves
[1:29:18.620 --> 1:29:21.260]  Of social chaos and unstable currencies
[1:29:21.500 --> 1:29:28.700]  But did you know that there's been times in the past during times of extreme hardship when americans put another store of value
[1:29:28.860 --> 1:29:36.140]  Above even silver and gold. It's true open pollinated seeds have been and could very well be the ultimate store of value
[1:29:36.140 --> 1:29:41.900]  In the coming hard times ahead go to survivalseedbank.com to get heirloom seeds below wholesale

[1:29:56.300 --> 1:30:02.300]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome. They are forcing mutations
[1:30:02.300 --> 1:30:05.900]  This is forced evolution or de-evolution
[1:30:06.380 --> 1:30:09.580]  When you look at all the major research all the major programs are carrying out
[1:30:09.980 --> 1:30:14.620]  They are not to produce people that are smarter or folks that live longer or more oral
[1:30:15.020 --> 1:30:20.700]  No, it's turning humanity into a commodity. Now. We see some propaganda like communist china bragging
[1:30:21.100 --> 1:30:27.180]  Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers supermen. That's a way to make it sexy that hey
[1:30:27.660 --> 1:30:29.660]  We're experimenting on our troops
[1:30:29.660 --> 1:30:35.820]  We'll send things with that into our troops and thousands and thousands of died each time they tried a new experimental vaccine
[1:30:36.220 --> 1:30:40.460]  I've talked to high level folks inside the federal government and the state of texas health department
[1:30:40.620 --> 1:30:42.620]  They say alex we know it hurts a lot of people
[1:30:42.860 --> 1:30:44.220]  It's for a greater good
[1:30:44.220 --> 1:30:49.260]  But that's not even true and it violates the Geneva convention the durmberg code federal state law
[1:30:49.740 --> 1:30:55.420]  This is violence being carried out against us by that of the tyranny and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary
[1:30:55.420 --> 1:31:00.220]  The great reset. Where have I heard of that before? Oh the great
[1:31:01.020 --> 1:31:03.020]  Leap forward mousetongue
[1:31:03.660 --> 1:31:06.060]  Ordering all the small towns and small farms
[1:31:06.460 --> 1:31:13.580]  To basically shut down and have the rural people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under communist commune control
[1:31:14.300 --> 1:31:18.380]  And that's all this is the big mega banks want to break us of the same ones that put mousetongue into power
[1:31:18.940 --> 1:31:23.740]  And they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy bringing in the new economy where everything's free
[1:31:23.740 --> 1:31:25.740]  Because when you're a prisoner
[1:31:26.220 --> 1:31:28.220]  Well, everything's free, but you're also a slave
[1:31:28.540 --> 1:31:32.860]  Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level
[1:31:33.180 --> 1:31:38.220]  But of course you got to take those vaccines. You can't have any kids and oh, don't worry though all of the
[1:31:38.860 --> 1:31:42.460]  Campons and and stuff like that's free too as well. I'm not kidding
[1:31:43.260 --> 1:31:47.180]  So give me some free paper. They give me enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment
[1:31:47.340 --> 1:31:50.460]  But they own you they control you that's the great reset
[1:31:50.460 --> 1:31:55.180]  That's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover and we're fighting it at infowars.com

[1:33:42.780 --> 1:33:44.780]  The devils group and what's coming next?
[1:33:45.260 --> 1:33:48.700]  That we should probably air towards the end of the third hour the beginning of the fourth hour
[1:33:49.420 --> 1:33:53.820]  Today, and I just want listeners to remember i'm not kissing your butt. It's true how important you are
[1:33:54.540 --> 1:33:59.900]  Out of the seven and a half billion people on the planet the the millions of you conservatively tuned in right now
[1:34:01.180 --> 1:34:04.460]  black white old young from japan to mexico from
[1:34:04.780 --> 1:34:10.780]  Germany to south africa to right here in the good old usa up to canada you name it to new zealand australia
[1:34:10.780 --> 1:34:14.860]  You need to understand something to russia. You need to understand something. This is real
[1:34:15.340 --> 1:34:21.100]  I wish this wasn't real. I'm a major target of this. They're trying to arrest me. They're trying to indict me
[1:34:21.100 --> 1:34:25.340]  I'm not even supposed to tell you about all this. Okay, and I'm not a victim. I chose this
[1:34:25.820 --> 1:34:32.700]  I expect this to happen. Does it make it fun? Does it make it happy? But I realize they're just going to get me a year or two before you
[1:34:32.700 --> 1:34:40.460]  I mean they have an insurance company actuaries. We started covering with the diggle report two years ago
[1:34:40.780 --> 1:34:47.180]  And this is for no other country that there'll be 200 million people in the us that 150 million will be gone by 2022
[1:34:47.980 --> 1:34:52.940]  Now i'm not saying that's going to happen, but insurance companies have us not even existing basically
[1:34:53.420 --> 1:34:55.420]  They have us completely out of the game fried
[1:34:55.900 --> 1:35:00.380]  Well, I saw all these headlines on cnn especially run by china and it was like oh
[1:35:00.380 --> 1:35:02.380]  Everyone's giving up on america
[1:35:02.460 --> 1:35:06.940]  No one's going to have jobs here because china shut down covet properly and is better than us
[1:35:07.180 --> 1:35:10.460]  Everyone's moving to china because joe biden's announced. We're not open for business
[1:35:11.980 --> 1:35:13.260]  This is economic warfare
[1:35:13.260 --> 1:35:17.900]  And I look at the leftists with their thumbs in their mouths domesticated living off the carcass of america
[1:35:18.220 --> 1:35:24.620]  Having no idea what's about to hit them. So only realism is going to get us out of this only admission of how much trouble we're in
[1:35:25.260 --> 1:35:27.260]  is going to get us out of this
[1:35:27.260 --> 1:35:30.540]  Well, let me tell you a democratic party senator bloominthal senator murphy
[1:35:30.620 --> 1:35:35.580]  They're on record saying for america to survive alex jones and info wars must be taken off the air
[1:35:36.060 --> 1:35:39.020]  So I have serious enemies and by the way i'm proud
[1:35:39.580 --> 1:35:42.620]  To have those evil enemies those sold out nobodies
[1:35:43.260 --> 1:35:44.220]  but
[1:35:44.220 --> 1:35:50.540]  I need you to understand how important you are and don't take time for granted. Yeah, we got five times the audience we had a year ago
[1:35:52.380 --> 1:35:55.260]  But that's still I don't care about that if i'm going to get destroyed
[1:35:55.260 --> 1:35:57.260]  I want to get destroyed for a good reason
[1:35:57.580 --> 1:36:00.620]  I'm going to fly my you know kamikaze plane into the deck of the ship
[1:36:01.340 --> 1:36:07.900]  Metaphorically the nonviolent. Well, that's an allegory not for real cnn that I want to go right into the engine room
[1:36:07.900 --> 1:36:11.420]  I want to go right into the weapons magazine and sink the whole ship
[1:36:12.300 --> 1:36:15.580]  I don't want to just crash into the side not do anything and spend my life
[1:36:16.140 --> 1:36:21.020]  Needlessly, but here's the deal. We may just see a global revolt against this people don't comply
[1:36:21.260 --> 1:36:23.900]  We could turn it around they're burning cities down all over the world
[1:36:23.900 --> 1:36:29.100]  Uh now and burning down covid centers knowing it's all a fraud in mainline conservative europe
[1:36:30.380 --> 1:36:31.340]  And by conservative europe
[1:36:31.340 --> 1:36:36.060]  I mean conservative people that don't usually get out and get violent in germany and in the netherlands and all over
[1:36:36.060 --> 1:36:42.540]  Are burning down the police stations and are burning down the covid centers and are burning down the hospitals because they're not stupid
[1:36:43.260 --> 1:36:46.620]  They know the real numbers and they know they're arresting doctors and scientists
[1:36:47.740 --> 1:36:50.140]  That tell the truth and by the way, I look at these crowds
[1:36:50.140 --> 1:36:55.340]  These are europeans doing this sick of the islamic invasion sick of the no-go zone sick of the new world order
[1:36:55.980 --> 1:37:00.460]  Am I saying it's good to go out and burn up police stations? I say it's good to go out and burn down covid centers
[1:37:01.260 --> 1:37:04.620]  Well, I'll tell you this I didn't start this fight and I'm not asking for this fight
[1:37:05.020 --> 1:37:07.020]  But i'll tell the globalist this
[1:37:07.180 --> 1:37:10.780]  Clash swab and all of you and bill gates. You're not getting away with this
[1:37:11.260 --> 1:37:13.260]  And I know you're really freaked out right now
[1:37:13.340 --> 1:37:19.100]  But I call the american people not to be offensively violent against capitals or police stations or military bases
[1:37:19.100 --> 1:37:22.700]  The globalists train you to attack those they have southern property law center
[1:37:22.940 --> 1:37:30.060]  Operatives infiltrating militias and and other groups trying to get them to hit military targets to then turn the military against us
[1:37:30.380 --> 1:37:33.820]  And then to also have a purge inside the military. I told you three weeks ago
[1:37:34.380 --> 1:37:38.540]  You watch the next thing will be the purge of the military even before january 6
[1:37:38.780 --> 1:37:43.660]  I said that's coming and then right for january 6. I said you watch they're going to call the troops in and then say they
[1:37:43.660 --> 1:37:46.140]  Can't be trusted. I know a communist takeover
[1:37:46.140 --> 1:37:51.180]  They're following the bolstered revolution because it's worked in over 20 countries. Do you understand?
[1:37:51.340 --> 1:37:56.940]  It's worked in vietnam. It's worked in venezuela. It's worked in cuba. It's worked in north korea. It's worked in china
[1:37:57.020 --> 1:38:00.780]  It's worked in europe. It's worked in the check republic romania
[1:38:01.020 --> 1:38:05.100]  Hungary poland would you like me to continue on for a while because I can list every damn one of them
[1:38:05.420 --> 1:38:07.420]  This is a tried and true blueprint
[1:38:08.300 --> 1:38:10.300]  You ask why they don't stop
[1:38:10.300 --> 1:38:15.420]  Because nobody's ever stopped them because we let the oh while the left's building up their their bases
[1:38:16.220 --> 1:38:20.060]  While the left's training everybody this stuff at universities are like, oh, don't shut us down
[1:38:20.300 --> 1:38:23.180]  We're just training to overthrow the country, but we have free speech right
[1:38:24.540 --> 1:38:28.460]  Right, okay, you have your free speech to overthrow the country and then we're like, hey, don't overthrow the country
[1:38:28.540 --> 1:38:31.260]  Don't bankrupt us. Oh, sorry your terrorists. We're gonna arrest you now
[1:38:31.980 --> 1:38:33.980]  See how they work
[1:38:33.980 --> 1:38:39.340]  So they're going for broke and they've got biden there because they know gutting the country is going to be incredibly unpopular
[1:38:39.340 --> 1:38:46.140]  They know so they've got him ready just to remove him again and bring in somebody more popular probably not even kamala harris
[1:38:46.940 --> 1:38:48.380]  so
[1:38:48.380 --> 1:38:54.300]  This is exchangeable people they're putting in and he's deteriorating fast, you know, oh and didn't just say that we've got the audio
[1:38:54.300 --> 1:38:58.700]  He should play it next segment. They can boost it up. You can hear it yesterday. He's like, I don't know what I'm signing
[1:38:58.700 --> 1:39:00.700]  Like
[1:39:00.700 --> 1:39:09.340]  Oh talk about 25th amendment. I mean, holy Toledo ladies and gentlemen, but I'll say this in closing
[1:39:10.060 --> 1:39:12.140]  When I talk about the new old order coming after us
[1:39:12.700 --> 1:39:17.980]  It's not a game. It's not a joke. You have to remember like dominoes like trump would always say if they get me
[1:39:18.060 --> 1:39:20.860]  They're gonna get you they don't hate me. They hate you they want to get through me
[1:39:21.660 --> 1:39:23.660]  and I still see everybody so mad at trump
[1:39:24.780 --> 1:39:26.380]  that he was
[1:39:26.380 --> 1:39:31.580]  Unable to stop all this but now it's even coming out in the news that he was ordering people to fire attorney generals
[1:39:31.740 --> 1:39:34.780]  And ordering people to just stop this and no one would do it
[1:39:35.260 --> 1:39:40.220]  So we're like, hey, let's have a rally on the six to show our numbers peacefully and trump's like i'm all for that
[1:39:41.180 --> 1:39:44.060]  And let's march to the capital little that he knows all the setup
[1:39:45.180 --> 1:39:48.140]  And now they're trying to indict well, they haven't died at him in the house
[1:39:48.620 --> 1:39:51.740]  They're now going to have a trial coming up in the middle of next month in february
[1:39:52.780 --> 1:39:54.780]  This starts on the eighth actually
[1:39:54.780 --> 1:39:56.620]  so early february
[1:39:56.620 --> 1:39:57.980]  trying to
[1:39:57.980 --> 1:40:02.060]  Strip him and the supreme court's ruled it's in the constitution. You can't try a private citizen
[1:40:02.300 --> 1:40:04.220]  He's no longer the president, but they don't care
[1:40:04.220 --> 1:40:06.860]  Because it's a tyranny people say oh screw him. He didn't stand up for us
[1:40:07.420 --> 1:40:12.700]  No one's ever gonna stand up for us for real if you throw people under the bus that try to do the best job they could
[1:40:13.180 --> 1:40:17.020]  It is the biggest wimp attitude out there and the biggest loser attitude out there
[1:40:17.180 --> 1:40:23.740]  That when somebody goes and bust their ass and loses billions of dollars and has their name destroyed and is losing their golf courses
[1:40:23.740 --> 1:40:29.500]  And losing everything and is under total attack that now that he's not up there and you feel reflected glory through him
[1:40:29.500 --> 1:40:34.060]  And oh, he's invincible in the cue stuff crap that now you're going to turn your back on him
[1:40:35.340 --> 1:40:37.420]  Trump is an example to any other leaders
[1:40:37.500 --> 1:40:42.380]  They already stabbed balsun arrow that if you run up against us and you don't do what we say in any way
[1:40:42.460 --> 1:40:44.460]  We're going to destroy you and your family
[1:40:44.620 --> 1:40:48.700]  So instead of letting them destroy trump we should hold him up as an example of victory
[1:40:49.180 --> 1:40:51.180]  And the fact that he sacrificed so much
[1:40:51.180 --> 1:40:56.860]  That's why they want to destroy info wars to teach anybody else never stand up and never take action or you'll get destroyed
[1:40:57.420 --> 1:40:59.420]  so instead of
[1:40:59.580 --> 1:41:03.580]  Getting down when we lose around or when the enemy strikes back and steals an election
[1:41:03.820 --> 1:41:08.460]  Instead of acting like the person that got overwhelmed by a hundred hyenas the lion
[1:41:08.940 --> 1:41:14.700]  Instead of celebrating that person you throw him into the bus because that makes you feel good because you're not associated with a loser
[1:41:14.780 --> 1:41:16.780]  Now that's loser behavior
[1:41:16.780 --> 1:41:23.020]  Remember the man in the arena teddy roosevelt you got to be in the arena before you can talk and trump made a lot of mistakes
[1:41:23.260 --> 1:41:26.540]  But let me tell you he had a bunch of cowards around him that weren't willing to take action
[1:41:26.700 --> 1:41:28.140]  That's the reason we're all in trouble
[1:41:28.140 --> 1:41:31.980]  And so all the guys talking about how you want civil war and how you want death and how you want to kill people
[1:41:32.220 --> 1:41:35.980]  Most of those are feds trying to hype you into going out doing something stupid
[1:41:36.620 --> 1:41:40.940]  Ladies and gentlemen if joe biden got shot tomorrow it would turn a loser into a winner
[1:41:40.940 --> 1:41:48.620]  They understand that psychology they would celebrate him if that happened they're destroying trump tearing him to pieces
[1:41:48.860 --> 1:41:53.740]  And so many people are are cutting and running from trump when they're really about to go after him even more
[1:41:53.820 --> 1:41:57.740]  And if they can get all his mega counts and if they can put him in prison do you think you're safe?
[1:41:58.380 --> 1:42:01.100]  He's a test case. So i'll say this again in closing
[1:42:01.820 --> 1:42:07.100]  We've stood the test of time we fought the globalist incredibly hard and we need to deserve your support
[1:42:07.100 --> 1:42:12.860]  I'm very thankful for but we need real hardcore support. I mean aggressive support if you're never going to fight in a physical war
[1:42:12.860 --> 1:42:14.380]  If you're not going to fight an information war
[1:42:14.380 --> 1:42:18.380]  So however you want to aggressively get info wars out and this live feed that the truth is alive
[1:42:18.540 --> 1:42:23.340]  What you're not supposed to hear it's still on the air while you still can we can win the enemy's not all powerful
[1:42:23.420 --> 1:42:25.100]  They need to shut us down because they're weak
[1:42:25.260 --> 1:42:29.100]  So again, however you can spread the word and however you can get the word out in front of your church
[1:42:29.260 --> 1:42:35.180]  Or on local cable tv in front of the city council or or the side of your barn or flying an airplane up there with info wars dot com
[1:42:35.180 --> 1:42:38.140]  I don't know how you're going to do it, but don't ask for permission. You got the permission
[1:42:38.220 --> 1:42:40.780]  You got me telling you do it now take action now
[1:42:40.940 --> 1:42:44.380]  Don't play games anymore because it's going to get a lot worse for against better folks
[1:42:44.620 --> 1:42:49.980]  So i'm all in i'm betting on you and i believe in you but now i need you to take action and not play games
[1:42:50.220 --> 1:42:51.340]  All right
[1:42:51.340 --> 1:42:57.980]  Owen stroyer is coming up. It needs to be our last broadcast any day now mountain patriot in colorado. Thank you for holding
[1:42:58.700 --> 1:43:00.140]  How you doing alex?
[1:43:00.140 --> 1:43:03.180]  Man, i'm just working as hard as i can. We're in such a critical time brother. How are you?
[1:43:03.180 --> 1:43:07.820]  I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug that dna force
[1:43:08.060 --> 1:43:13.100]  I love it. I've been using it quite a while and I just went looked at the ingredients again the other day
[1:43:13.180 --> 1:43:15.180]  And I see that it contains corsets in
[1:43:16.140 --> 1:43:20.780]  Which according to some published studies that dr. Merkel has cited
[1:43:21.500 --> 1:43:25.100]  Is an ionophore similar to hydroxychloroquine?
[1:43:25.660 --> 1:43:30.140]  And it helps channel the zinc into the cells so people might want to take a look at that
[1:43:30.140 --> 1:43:32.700]  But all I know is with dna force
[1:43:33.580 --> 1:43:36.220]  We went out and looked at these high-end products
[1:43:36.780 --> 1:43:41.100]  That they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription but the doctor sells like 300 bucks a bottle
[1:43:41.340 --> 1:43:44.300]  Because there's a lot of expensive product in them. It's really only cost them like 50 bucks
[1:43:44.540 --> 1:43:50.860]  And so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what produced this so thanks. Thanks for the plug
[1:43:50.860 --> 1:43:58.220]  Anybody listening to my voice you can simply search engine the term devos group
[1:43:58.780 --> 1:44:00.780]  technocracy or technocrats
[1:44:01.340 --> 1:44:03.340]  you will get
[1:44:03.340 --> 1:44:06.940]  cloush wob and john codd yunker and all the new world order
[1:44:07.820 --> 1:44:09.820]  globalists like ggping saying
[1:44:10.220 --> 1:44:13.020]  That they no longer want elected leaders over governments
[1:44:13.500 --> 1:44:19.020]  But they want businessmen technocrats over it and that's who cloush wob is you might want to do that
[1:44:19.020 --> 1:44:22.460]  And that's who cloush wob is you might want to look into the guy that says they've watched
[1:44:23.100 --> 1:44:28.460]  The covet 19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor you might want to find out who this super villain is
[1:44:29.100 --> 1:44:31.580]  He believes because he's hidden playing you
[1:44:32.220 --> 1:44:34.780]  And you're not speaking out against it that he has a right to do it to you
[1:44:35.180 --> 1:44:38.220]  You might want to find who he works for yours directly for prince charles
[1:44:38.860 --> 1:44:45.740]  He developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability. That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own works
[1:44:45.740 --> 1:44:51.340]  So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you for you take those shots
[1:44:51.580 --> 1:44:54.380]  You might just want to find out who this villain is. All right
[1:44:58.060 --> 1:45:02.220]  The resistance dot video the resistance dot video
[1:45:02.860 --> 1:45:11.260]  The resistance dot video the resistance dot video the resistance dot video the resistance dot video

[1:45:14.300 --> 1:45:16.300]  news wars dot com
[1:45:16.300 --> 1:45:20.700]  band dot video and hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned
[1:45:21.260 --> 1:45:26.380]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it
[1:45:26.940 --> 1:45:30.620]  But sorrows and bill gates and the globalists are on our tail
[1:45:31.180 --> 1:45:37.420]  But the new website is the resistance dot video the resistance dot video
[1:45:37.820 --> 1:45:41.820]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them
[1:45:41.820 --> 1:45:48.780]  So the new URL that links right to band dot video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports
[1:45:49.020 --> 1:45:56.700]  And all the suppressed information is that the resistance dot video share the link the resistance dot video the resistance dot video
[1:45:57.580 --> 1:46:04.380]  I love the patriot blend wake up america coffee. I just love it. I can't get enough of it

[1:47:18.380 --> 1:47:20.620]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live
[1:47:20.620 --> 1:47:27.980]  I'm here taking a few days off the family enjoying the last limmering because there is a war on for your mind
[1:47:29.180 --> 1:47:33.900]  I am here with my family enjoying the last glimmering moments of any freedom left in this country
[1:47:34.300 --> 1:47:37.260]  They're going to use domestic terror attacks false flags that are staged
[1:47:37.820 --> 1:47:39.820]  to bring in a permanent
[1:47:40.700 --> 1:47:42.700]  permanent lockdown
[1:47:42.700 --> 1:47:44.700]  of this country
[1:47:44.700 --> 1:47:50.060]  Breaking America down officially under you and directed marshal law watch live again. I hope you all share that link, but
[1:47:51.020 --> 1:47:54.300]  I'm not hunter s. Thompson that would go out and write myself into my own stories
[1:47:54.380 --> 1:47:57.340]  We are the story you are the story fighting the new world order
[1:47:57.340 --> 1:48:02.300]  You are in an occupied country with multinational corporations trying to break your will and take over
[1:48:03.340 --> 1:48:08.060]  Now I grew up playing a little bit of football and I grew up watch the Dallas cowboys and it was a big football fan
[1:48:08.540 --> 1:48:13.660]  But once I got older and learned about the new world order and the takeover of my country that it was american versus globalist
[1:48:13.660 --> 1:48:19.980]  Christians versus satanist. I stopped watching sports because I just can't give my emotions
[1:48:20.700 --> 1:48:22.700]  to something
[1:48:23.020 --> 1:48:26.460]  Like that sports were set up as you know thousands of years ago by every culture
[1:48:27.740 --> 1:48:33.420]  To ritualize war and in many cultures they would actually kill each other in the sports games the Aztecs and others did that
[1:48:33.500 --> 1:48:35.500]  Of course, you know about gladiators and the romans
[1:48:36.060 --> 1:48:38.460]  And the rest of it and that was also a religious ritual
[1:48:38.460 --> 1:48:44.380]  Most gladiatorial events were actually private at the homes of rich romans and for a wedding or for a death
[1:48:45.180 --> 1:48:50.300]  Of say the head of the household you would have, you know, maybe five ten fifteen gladiators fight to the death
[1:48:51.500 --> 1:48:53.900]  Just to signify a loss of life
[1:48:54.460 --> 1:48:58.380]  Because that cost you money to have full grown trained men kill each other. It was very expensive
[1:48:58.700 --> 1:49:02.300]  It'd be like, you know a Lamborghini brand new Lamborghini every time one of them dies
[1:49:02.620 --> 1:49:06.540]  And this is money pouring on the ground. It's a sacrifice to mars
[1:49:06.540 --> 1:49:10.380]  It's a sacrifice to jupiter. It's a sacrifice to satan. And so
[1:49:11.820 --> 1:49:14.540]  The globalists are sacrificing you on their altar
[1:49:15.500 --> 1:49:20.060]  And they're not just going to let you go through life lackadaisical. They are taking over the civilization
[1:49:20.620 --> 1:49:23.020]  They are taking over the society. And so you
[1:49:23.740 --> 1:49:28.060]  Absolutely must start valuing your speech and your freedom because it was paid for
[1:49:28.700 --> 1:49:32.780]  In the last thousand years basically starting in england with the magna carta
[1:49:32.780 --> 1:49:40.540]  Towards what you have and all that gas in the tank hundreds and hundreds of years of freedom that was fought for is being evaporated every few weeks now
[1:49:41.420 --> 1:49:44.060]  I mean, they only ran through half our freedom the last 50 years
[1:49:44.620 --> 1:49:47.740]  And now in the last couple years, they've run through most of the last half tank
[1:49:48.300 --> 1:49:50.300]  And we're down to an inch right now
[1:49:51.420 --> 1:49:55.100]  And it's all just been thrown to the wind. It's no longer sacred anymore
[1:49:56.380 --> 1:49:58.380]  And so I like tom brady
[1:49:58.380 --> 1:50:02.700]  And I've watched some nfl football and I guess it's healthy at a certain level to try to watch a little bit of it
[1:50:03.180 --> 1:50:08.940]  As a distraction to forget where you are except you turn on the nfl. It's black lives matter. It's it's world government
[1:50:08.940 --> 1:50:13.740]  It's all these weird transgender ads. So they lost about half their audience the last few years
[1:50:13.900 --> 1:50:15.900]  But just take the tom brady case
[1:50:16.060 --> 1:50:21.500]  You see somebody already the best in the league ever their team's done with him throw him out unceremoniously
[1:50:21.740 --> 1:50:25.260]  He goes to a really bad team and takes him to super bowl the first year
[1:50:25.260 --> 1:50:28.860]  Now why is everybody so excited about that? And how is it bringing back?
[1:50:29.740 --> 1:50:31.740]  Most of viewers that left overnight
[1:50:32.220 --> 1:50:36.780]  Because that's the real story of like america. It's the best. Everybody knows it's the best
[1:50:37.020 --> 1:50:39.100]  It's thrown out in the woods at night
[1:50:39.180 --> 1:50:43.580]  It's pissed on because they don't like its success because it makes everything else look so bad
[1:50:43.820 --> 1:50:48.940]  They're waiting for it to fail. This is a known phenomenon take the 1970s movie with james kahn
[1:50:49.260 --> 1:50:51.580]  That if you want to know about globalism watch that movie
[1:50:51.580 --> 1:50:57.260]  They have cities that the globalists run everybody else is under their control just like the hunger games
[1:50:57.820 --> 1:50:59.820]  they have regions
[1:51:00.460 --> 1:51:06.620]  And they have districts basically and only the corporate elite have rights and the corporate elite come in the movie
[1:51:07.180 --> 1:51:11.340]  And they want his wife. Oh, you're the number one superstar in the world. We're really jealous of you
[1:51:11.420 --> 1:51:14.140]  We use this to distract the planet from corporate rule
[1:51:14.940 --> 1:51:17.420]  And it is a blood sport. It's gladiatorial
[1:51:17.420 --> 1:51:21.420]  And if you won't give up, we are gonna basically kill you
[1:51:22.540 --> 1:51:30.540]  Well, first they take his wife then they wanting to lose the game and and and go away. So again, it's the it's it's it's it's the tom brady story
[1:51:31.340 --> 1:51:33.340]  All over again
[1:51:33.820 --> 1:51:39.180]  Because the system doesn't want you to think is the individual is being strong or somebody being super excellent
[1:51:39.420 --> 1:51:43.420]  And he's also been a trump supporter, but everybody's tuning back in because they love that underdog
[1:51:43.420 --> 1:51:47.260]  Well, america is that underdog and globalism is the whole system
[1:51:47.340 --> 1:51:53.100]  So the left calls themselves the resistance and they call themselves the outsiders. They have hollywood. They have the big banks
[1:51:53.260 --> 1:51:58.140]  They have the media. They have academia. They have the chai cons. They have the pedophiles
[1:51:58.300 --> 1:52:03.020]  They have the whole power structure. They have the system and and and all the publications are left
[1:52:03.100 --> 1:52:07.900]  It's because that's what the banks fund is the poison of controlling us ladies and gentlemen
[1:52:08.300 --> 1:52:09.980]  and that's why
[1:52:09.980 --> 1:52:13.660]  They attack and that's why they demonize anybody that stands up against them
[1:52:13.820 --> 1:52:16.140]  Well, instead of getting excited nothing against tom brady
[1:52:16.620 --> 1:52:21.980]  About him being an underdog sure that'll make bella check and it'll make all these other people look like fools
[1:52:22.700 --> 1:52:25.420]  Who cares about all that though that gets your emotions going
[1:52:25.580 --> 1:52:32.220]  This is the real game for your children your fertility your own body being able to run your own life being able to have the
[1:52:32.220 --> 1:52:34.220]  own sovereignty of your country
[1:52:34.620 --> 1:52:36.620]  having due process
[1:52:36.620 --> 1:52:41.740]  That's all what is being flushed out and destroyed and so that's why I tell you again
[1:52:43.900 --> 1:52:48.300]  If the globalists were all powerful they wouldn't care what we were saying and doing if the globalists were all powerful
[1:52:48.300 --> 1:52:52.300]  They wouldn't be spending hundreds of billions of dollars to silence us and engage in all this criminal activity
[1:52:53.420 --> 1:52:59.900]  And now they have overwhelmed the government overwhelmed the states with total draconian censorship now taking bank accounts away from the president
[1:53:00.140 --> 1:53:02.940]  Now calling for senator josh holly and ted cruises
[1:53:02.940 --> 1:53:09.340]  Expulsion from the senate all based on the lie that trump sent people to ransack the capital
[1:53:09.500 --> 1:53:13.500]  Which absolutely hurt him and did not help him which there's no evidence he did instead
[1:53:13.500 --> 1:53:17.340]  They had their own provocateurs ready and set none of which have been arrested
[1:53:18.140 --> 1:53:19.420]  only
[1:53:19.420 --> 1:53:24.540]  The q people that followed them in who were innocent and were not bad and thought they were on a tourer and stayed within the
[1:53:24.540 --> 1:53:28.540]  Velvet ropes they've all been indicted. They're facing 25 years in prison
[1:53:28.540 --> 1:53:34.380]  Uh the q shaman I may not not I may not disagree with him, but he's a nice guy an idiot being walked into a trap
[1:53:34.380 --> 1:53:35.900]  I feel sorry for him
[1:53:35.900 --> 1:53:40.460]  They're all indicted because they're nonviolent all the real operatives nothing nothing nothing
[1:53:40.700 --> 1:53:45.980]  Even though they bragged about how they broke in and what they did not the antifa and not the other group
[1:53:46.620 --> 1:53:48.620]  Infiltrated militias 2.0
[1:53:49.020 --> 1:53:51.820]  And so the folks that stayed in the velvet ropes they're all indicted
[1:53:52.540 --> 1:53:55.900]  But the people that actually broke down the windows and beat the cops heads in
[1:53:55.900 --> 1:53:57.900]  They are all saluted
[1:53:57.980 --> 1:54:02.700]  They've all done an excellent job because they work for the southern prairie law center guaranteed
[1:54:02.940 --> 1:54:07.340]  I've seen their operatives. I ran into them in dc. I saw their systems how they try to hype you up
[1:54:07.420 --> 1:54:12.940]  Come on. Let's be violent. Don't be a wimp. Alex. It's a revolution. We know who you are. We've got your number
[1:54:13.660 --> 1:54:19.900]  Southern prairie law centers put up attack maps on what places to fire bomb and shoot up fire bombings shootings are happening every week now
[1:54:19.900 --> 1:54:24.940]  They fire bombed a baptist church in southern california, uh, hispanic church last night burned it down
[1:54:25.740 --> 1:54:29.740]  Okay, there's your real terrorist attacks. And so the southern prairie law center. We know your terrorist
[1:54:29.820 --> 1:54:34.540]  We know you got two billion offshore. We know morris d's was compromised by sex operatives
[1:54:34.700 --> 1:54:39.580]  We know he's run by e.u. intelligence and sorrows. We know everything we know about elehiem city
[1:54:39.900 --> 1:54:41.900]  We know about who placed the bombs in the building
[1:54:42.060 --> 1:54:44.780]  We have all the information directly from the police in Oklahoma city
[1:54:45.020 --> 1:54:48.780]  We know the fbi came in their offices and threatened to kill them don browning and others
[1:54:48.780 --> 1:54:53.580]  I interviewed all the families of the copter and ciege. They tortured to death. We know we know who you are
[1:54:53.820 --> 1:54:55.820]  We know your number. We're watching you
[1:54:57.500 --> 1:55:00.380]  And we know you're planning terror attacks and you're gonna get exposed when they come out
[1:55:00.380 --> 1:55:04.460]  Because we're not gonna back down and the more you try to crush us the stronger we get because people are praying for
[1:55:04.540 --> 1:55:09.180]  Info wars and they're praying for global awakening. So don't let this get you down folks. We knew this was coming
[1:55:09.740 --> 1:55:13.580]  Trump was only a beachhead. They overran that beachhead. But now they've got a corpse up there
[1:55:13.980 --> 1:55:17.740]  Operating and trying to sell us on this. Oh and you go ahead and take over you're doing a fabulous job
[1:55:17.740 --> 1:55:20.380]  I love you to death and I appreciate you. I'm not gonna be on tomorrow
[1:55:20.700 --> 1:55:22.380]  I'm gonna let you run the show
[1:55:22.380 --> 1:55:25.100]  Because I promise to go to the top of the mountain and do some stuff with the children
[1:55:25.260 --> 1:55:29.900]  But I really appreciate you. Give me your allegory or your parallel to my tom brady analogy
[1:55:30.620 --> 1:55:32.860]  Well, I actually haven't written down here
[1:55:32.860 --> 1:55:38.060]  I'd like to get your response to this because we constantly talk about this and you had the knowledge of how
[1:55:38.700 --> 1:55:43.340]  The globalists have 50 years in advance of technology. They had the internet well before it came out
[1:55:43.340 --> 1:55:48.060]  They had the tv years before it came out. They have advanced technology. They're basically sitting on
[1:55:48.380 --> 1:55:53.980]  Waiting for the opportune time to release it or give it to an individual to release it to empower that individual as an operative
[1:55:54.380 --> 1:55:56.380]  well, we have
[1:55:56.540 --> 1:56:01.100]  The 50 years in advance spirit of resistance the 50 years in advance spirit of liberty
[1:56:01.260 --> 1:56:03.580]  And so I'm starting to see it catch up alex
[1:56:04.220 --> 1:56:07.180]  My escape from the madness is as you know going to the gym
[1:56:07.260 --> 1:56:10.380]  And so it's like I'm at the gym and we're playing basketball
[1:56:10.380 --> 1:56:14.140]  And I don't even have to be the one that tells the workers. Hey, the mass doesn't work
[1:56:14.380 --> 1:56:17.820]  I don't have to be the one that says hey, this whole covert thing is nonsense. Leave us alone
[1:56:18.060 --> 1:56:21.820]  It's like watching other people doing it and it's like the allegory of watching
[1:56:22.140 --> 1:56:28.460]  You know your kid take its first step, you know to have its first word. It's like, oh my gosh, america's waking up. Oh my gosh
[1:56:28.700 --> 1:56:33.740]  I'm not alone. Oh my gosh. Finally people are getting it. So that 50 years in advance spirit of resistance
[1:56:34.140 --> 1:56:37.020]  I think it's starting to catch up. But it's like an immovable force
[1:56:37.020 --> 1:56:43.420]  Uh are an unstoppable force and an immovable object that we're we're witnessing right here with the spirit of resistance and the new world order
[1:56:44.060 --> 1:56:48.860]  I totally agree. They're gonna their only help is provocateur are people to do stupid mindless violent stuff
[1:56:49.180 --> 1:56:54.860]  It targets that don't even matter only hurt us. Um, so anybody tells you, you know, breaking into capital beating people up
[1:56:55.020 --> 1:56:59.820]  It's gonna advance our cause they're idiots expose devos expose Schwab expose gates
[1:57:00.140 --> 1:57:06.700]  Exposed Fauci expose. They launched the bio attack call for their imprisonment call for any of the lockdowns expose china joe
[1:57:06.700 --> 1:57:11.420]  The support free speech demand governors in congress take action against this globalist threat
[1:57:11.740 --> 1:57:17.980]  Call the enemy out for who they are go 110 percent against them and don't back down and be a leader oan
[1:57:18.140 --> 1:57:22.060]  Just like you just said. All right, oan. You're taking over. I want to thank the listeners for their support again
[1:57:22.380 --> 1:57:25.980]  Everyone listening tell folks about the local stations you're listening to tv and radio
[1:57:26.300 --> 1:57:33.660]  Tell people now take the stream from info wars.com and bandot video and share it say here's the forbidden info about what's really happening
[1:57:33.660 --> 1:57:37.340]  Here's what's coming next and here's how we stop it people are hungry for the truth
[1:57:37.580 --> 1:57:43.900]  We've been stayed on air by the grace of god for this time now all our work now comes together in 2021
[1:57:46.940 --> 1:57:52.380]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply secure your own safe source of food supply sale
[1:57:52.460 --> 1:57:53.980]  It's the new prices in 2021
[1:57:53.980 --> 1:57:58.060]  But it's the lowest price for high quality food you're gonna find at info wars store.com
[1:57:58.140 --> 1:58:01.820]  The subsection is prepared with alex.com and it's all these globalists do this
[1:58:01.820 --> 1:58:03.820]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare
[1:58:04.540 --> 1:58:10.060]  You need to understand that you need 25 year foods that rely on the last 25 years one month three months six months
[1:58:10.140 --> 1:58:14.620]  One year supplies and it's the highest quality you're gonna find and it's just good to have that check box
[1:58:15.020 --> 1:58:17.980]  Taken care of and you know, you're getting good food at a very good price
[1:58:18.060 --> 1:58:23.340]  And you know that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our operation
[1:58:23.420 --> 1:58:30.060]  So prepare alex.com or info wars store.com you can find prepare in this section there water filtration air filtration
[1:58:30.060 --> 1:58:33.820]  It's all there the technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the force gmo and more
[1:58:33.900 --> 1:58:36.540]  It's time to start getting prepared it starts with self-defense
[1:58:36.620 --> 1:58:41.580]  It starts with a being prepared it starts with horrible food it starts with digging in with a long globalist fight
[1:58:41.660 --> 1:58:43.660]  You'll win in the end
[1:58:46.460 --> 1:58:52.460]  The pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth and create a
[1:58:52.700 --> 1:58:58.780]  Planetary universal income which of course the united nations and global corporations will control through the apps on your phone
[1:58:58.780 --> 1:59:03.260]  And finally a chip under your skin. It's all now completely official part of the
[1:59:03.660 --> 1:59:07.260]  UN great reset of the Davos group and claus schwaab
[1:59:07.820 --> 1:59:13.180]  All officially written about in hundreds of books by schwaab and rockma feller foundation all the rest of them at 10 to
[1:59:13.260 --> 1:59:20.620]  21 20 30 it's here and only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder until you reject it all
[1:59:20.620 --> 1:59:27.260]  And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle the first evil and stopping abortion
[1:59:27.340 --> 1:59:32.380]  We must start valuing human life again. We must start saying that we are not expendable
[1:59:32.460 --> 1:59:37.820]  That we are not disposable that we are essential until we do that
[1:59:37.900 --> 1:59:43.260]  We are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic god-given human rights now
[1:59:43.260 --> 1:59:49.980]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:00:05.020 --> 2:00:09.020]  So you have
[2:00:09.020 --> 2:00:17.740]  Targeted political persecution of trump supporters and patriots right now
[2:00:19.340 --> 2:00:26.140]  And of course they are making the connection saying oh you thought the election was stolen. So therefore you're a terrorist
[2:00:26.860 --> 2:00:32.700]  Oh, you voted trump you supported trump. So therefore anything that happens by a trump supporter. You're guilty
[2:00:32.700 --> 2:00:42.140]  Now can you imagine if the same standard applied to them? I could go off with about 20 different examples right now
[2:00:42.220 --> 2:00:44.620]  But let's just look here at today
[2:00:46.780 --> 2:00:48.780]  Spike Lee
[2:00:49.740 --> 2:00:52.860]  Anti-white bigot comes out and makes a statement
[2:00:54.940 --> 2:00:57.500]  At the new york film critics awards
[2:00:57.500 --> 2:01:02.620]  And he says trump will go down in history with the likes of hitler
[2:01:03.900 --> 2:01:08.380]  And of course uses his whole speech to demonize america demonize white people
[2:01:09.260 --> 2:01:11.260]  Demonize trump and then in
[2:01:12.460 --> 2:01:15.100]  Unintentional irony. He says I quote
[2:01:15.500 --> 2:01:20.460]  There's no way possible to go before the iphone and thank you guys without telling you what's in my heart and soul
[2:01:20.540 --> 2:01:23.100]  As a descendant of slaves who helped build this country
[2:01:23.100 --> 2:01:26.940]  The irony is of course it was slaves that built his iphone
[2:01:28.220 --> 2:01:30.220]  Probably black ones
[2:01:30.220 --> 2:01:34.220]  But that's unimportant to an ignoramus racist like spike lee
[2:01:36.220 --> 2:01:39.580]  And then you had this story going viral today from the hill
[2:01:39.580 --> 2:01:46.940]  Police have fatally shot at least 135 unarmed black people in us since 2015 according to a report
[2:01:47.500 --> 2:01:49.500]  An npr investigation
[2:01:49.500 --> 2:01:52.700]  You do the math. It's about 27 a year
[2:01:53.340 --> 2:01:55.340]  If you even believe those numbers
[2:01:55.420 --> 2:01:57.420]  But okay
[2:01:57.740 --> 2:02:04.220]  So this then leads to media coverage and social commentary
[2:02:06.700 --> 2:02:11.420]  And I've seen it these tweets go viral synthetically or organically either way
[2:02:12.060 --> 2:02:16.060]  And it's just black people saying when are white people going to stop killing us?
[2:02:16.060 --> 2:02:22.060]  When are white people going to stop killing us? When are we going to stop having a country one run by white supremacists?
[2:02:22.460 --> 2:02:27.820]  And of course those that are still left on twitter share the fbi statistics and show that unarmed white people are killed by
[2:02:28.620 --> 2:02:30.620]  killed by black people at
[2:02:31.820 --> 2:02:33.820]  500 percent the number
[2:02:34.700 --> 2:02:40.140]  Of either cops being killed or cops killing unarmed black people or or white people killing unarmed black people but see
[2:02:40.140 --> 2:02:46.060]  It's all about pushing that narrative pushing that big lie to divide us
[2:02:47.260 --> 2:02:49.260]  and pit one
[2:02:49.580 --> 2:02:53.580]  Group against the other using propaganda now. What does that lead to?
[2:02:55.020 --> 2:02:58.540]  Take a look at what happened last night
[2:02:59.740 --> 2:03:01.740]  in new york
[2:03:01.900 --> 2:03:06.300]  Where a group of criminals attack a 26 year old man in manhattan
[2:03:07.180 --> 2:03:09.100]  and then in a
[2:03:09.100 --> 2:03:11.100]  I guess
[2:03:11.420 --> 2:03:14.860]  Humiliation ritual strip him down naked
[2:03:16.140 --> 2:03:18.460]  And then take his cell phone guys rule the b-roll of this
[2:03:19.580 --> 2:03:25.500]  Now you tell me what you see here by the way this guy is a blm hoodie on one of the suspects of this mugging
[2:03:26.220 --> 2:03:28.860]  So there are the suspects right there and then there's the victim
[2:03:29.580 --> 2:03:33.580]  Now do I do what do you notice here? Do you need to state the obvious?
[2:03:33.580 --> 2:03:39.820]  One white guy in the whole frame
[2:03:40.860 --> 2:03:45.420]  Getting stomped into the cement and publicly humiliated and having everything stolen off of him
[2:03:46.940 --> 2:03:50.620]  In broad daylight in manhattan and you can't even have a gun to defend yourself
[2:03:53.500 --> 2:03:55.500]  That's attempted murder
[2:03:55.980 --> 2:04:01.100]  So there's your guy in your black lives matter hoodie attempted murder on whitey walking down the block
[2:04:01.100 --> 2:04:03.740]  So spike lee responsible for that
[2:04:05.420 --> 2:04:08.060]  Is the media doing the racial division responsible for that?
[2:04:08.700 --> 2:04:11.340]  Here's another video from paris same thing
[2:04:12.220 --> 2:04:14.220]  15 year old ukrainian
[2:04:15.820 --> 2:04:20.460]  Attacked and beaten viciously in the streets by a mob same story that you see in new york
[2:04:24.060 --> 2:04:25.100]  So
[2:04:25.100 --> 2:04:27.660]  They won't talk about this. They'll never report on this
[2:04:27.660 --> 2:04:34.860]  They won't point out the obvious because they know they did it, but they love it. So, yeah
[2:04:38.300 --> 2:04:40.300]  This is what happens when racists
[2:04:41.660 --> 2:04:43.660]  anti-white racists
[2:04:43.740 --> 2:04:47.020]  Are in politics and in government and then they complain
[2:04:48.140 --> 2:04:51.020]  And justify any crime against a white person is a good thing
[2:04:51.020 --> 2:04:53.020]  I
[2:04:57.260 --> 2:05:00.460]  Ladies and gentlemen, I've studied history. I've interviewed all the experts
[2:05:00.860 --> 2:05:07.020]  I have looked at every facet of this and now the only days until the inauguration of the chi-com agent
[2:05:07.420 --> 2:05:10.780]  It's all coming into place. That's how they change the subject from election fraud
[2:05:10.940 --> 2:05:13.180]  It's how they change the subject from hunter's laptop
[2:05:13.340 --> 2:05:19.900]  It's how they change the subject from epstein and obama and al-qaeda and the new world order and
[2:05:19.900 --> 2:05:23.980]  And now use the already martial law in place for covet 19
[2:05:23.980 --> 2:05:27.180]  And that's what it is to then be expanded and become political
[2:05:27.900 --> 2:05:31.580]  And become permanent. They train you to stay in your houses. They train you to be tracked
[2:05:31.820 --> 2:05:38.060]  They train and do what you're told for nine ten months is training wheels and now they launch the storm the storm is here
[2:05:38.940 --> 2:05:40.700]  It's a globalist storm
[2:05:40.700 --> 2:05:42.700]  There's not gonna be martial law for trump
[2:05:42.700 --> 2:05:46.140]  There's to be martial law for the globalist. They're trying to set you up
[2:05:46.140 --> 2:05:51.580]  Don't be involved in violence expose the new world order and expose the takeover with information
[2:05:51.820 --> 2:05:53.900]  That's how we beat these people with truth
[2:06:04.460 --> 2:06:12.460]  You found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with owin troyer
[2:06:12.460 --> 2:06:18.780]  And now we open up the phone lines. We are going to take first time callers today
[2:06:19.660 --> 2:06:24.300]  First time callers today. In fact, that's the first time we've taken first time callers
[2:06:25.100 --> 2:06:28.220]  In the year 2021 first time callers today

[2:06:37.660 --> 2:06:40.700]  And don't forget ladies and gentlemen
[2:06:41.020 --> 2:06:46.940]  In fact, they just gave me a fresh bottle of the pure turmeric extract from infowarstore.com
[2:06:47.980 --> 2:06:54.460]  We set off to create our own turmeric extract that was even more powerful and high quality than what we had been selling
[2:06:54.700 --> 2:07:00.700]  We researched and tested formulas from dozens of manufacturers, but none were up to the info wars life platinum standard
[2:07:01.260 --> 2:07:05.820]  Years later, we have finally secured a first run of the new info wars life
[2:07:05.820 --> 2:07:07.820]  Pure turmeric extract
[2:07:07.820 --> 2:07:17.820]  Exclusively available at infowarstore.com for thousands of years turmeric has been a staple in traditional indian iu vertic
[2:07:18.380 --> 2:07:26.380]  And chinese medicine. Thanks for throwing that one in there guys really appreciate that word and science has now confirmed that turmeric is
[2:07:26.780 --> 2:07:32.300]  Has even more antioxidants potential than vitamin c or vitamin d again

[2:07:52.220 --> 2:07:56.540]  Must be elite though. It's only elite if it's at infowarstore.com. All right
[2:07:56.540 --> 2:08:02.300]  The crew is getting the first time callers lined up here. I've got news that I can pile drive through as we do that
[2:08:07.260 --> 2:08:10.780]  Devos the world economic forum is meeting there
[2:08:12.460 --> 2:08:15.580]  And now they've said oh, we're permanently banning
[2:08:16.540 --> 2:08:18.540]  Donald trump. Oh
[2:08:18.540 --> 2:08:23.100]  They don't even want him there. They don't want him in there listening on in on what they're doing
[2:08:23.100 --> 2:08:27.980]  And I wonder how many of the organizers of this
[2:08:29.740 --> 2:08:36.140]  Actually made a billion dollars on their own accord but not through non-governmental but governmental really world governmental entities
[2:08:38.380 --> 2:08:42.700]  Just shifting political money back and forth government funding back and forth
[2:08:44.380 --> 2:08:50.620]  So they say nope, we don't want trump and he can never come back because he'll tell the world our plan to destroy the
[2:08:50.620 --> 2:08:54.460]  Because he'll tell the world our plan to destroy the world economy in a great
[2:08:55.420 --> 2:08:58.460]  reset, but jijin ping the chinese dictator
[2:09:00.140 --> 2:09:02.140]  He delivers speech
[2:09:03.180 --> 2:09:04.300]  to
[2:09:04.300 --> 2:09:06.460]  Open up the world economic forum in devos
[2:09:07.260 --> 2:09:12.140]  They are admitting they said it was a conspiracy theory. Remember that they said oh conspiracy theory. There's no great reset
[2:09:12.140 --> 2:09:17.260]  Well, that's the theme of the devos 2021 to achieve a great reset
[2:09:17.260 --> 2:09:20.540]  And of course the organizer the head of it claus Schwab
[2:09:22.060 --> 2:09:26.940]  He says it. I mean he said great reset probably a dozen times and they just say stop saying great reset
[2:09:27.020 --> 2:09:29.020]  That's a conspiracy theory
[2:09:29.740 --> 2:09:32.540]  And it just shows you how out of control out of touch
[2:09:33.580 --> 2:09:38.220]  The mainstream media really is it's unfathomable quite frankly
[2:09:41.740 --> 2:09:43.740]  Other things
[2:09:43.740 --> 2:09:47.740]  That are being discussed obviously how they're going to launch new world wars
[2:09:48.460 --> 2:09:50.460]  To consolidate even more power
[2:09:51.420 --> 2:09:55.340]  How they're going to continue to siphon power off of the fake pandemic
[2:09:57.820 --> 2:09:59.980]  Just some of the other agenda
[2:10:00.860 --> 2:10:05.660]  Items at the world economic forum in devos, but oh it's a conspiracy there in fact
[2:10:06.460 --> 2:10:11.820]  Conspiracy theory president jijin ping probably doesn't even exist. He's not even a real person
[2:10:11.820 --> 2:10:14.860]  In fact china doesn't even exist. It's a conspiracy theory
[2:10:15.340 --> 2:10:18.140]  There's no such thing as the communist chinese
[2:10:18.860 --> 2:10:23.820]  It doesn't even exist. Okay, so just calm
[2:10:24.700 --> 2:10:26.380]  down
[2:10:26.380 --> 2:10:28.380]  All right, the great reset
[2:10:28.860 --> 2:10:30.460]  Is not happening
[2:10:30.460 --> 2:10:42.620]  There is no new world order. There is no world economic forum. I mean hell they might as well go that far at this point
[2:10:44.620 --> 2:10:50.860]  Because all the double standard all the hypocrisy all the lies all the deception just hits me like a wave
[2:10:51.500 --> 2:10:54.780]  And it's like do I just cover the waterfront of all of it again? I mean joe biden
[2:10:56.380 --> 2:10:58.460]  Wasn't it joe biden at the world economic forum?
[2:10:58.460 --> 2:11:00.460]  I
[2:11:02.140 --> 2:11:09.020]  Blackmailed I bribed ukraine with billions of dollars in foreign aid to get my son a million-dollar job on a
[2:11:09.820 --> 2:11:14.780]  oil company board, but the company was being investigated for criminal activity by a prosecutor, so
[2:11:15.900 --> 2:11:21.980]  I joe biden said on a live camera on a live feed. I bragged
[2:11:21.980 --> 2:11:29.180]  I joe biden, I bragged about how I got that prosecutor fired to enrich my family
[2:11:30.940 --> 2:11:36.700]  And how I used my position of political power and my country's taxpayer dollars to do it
[2:11:38.140 --> 2:11:42.940]  That's the response
[2:11:44.940 --> 2:11:47.340]  Oh, I'm sure it's a conspiracy theory that uh
[2:11:47.340 --> 2:11:50.940]  Biden wants to hurt america. I'm sure that's just a
[2:11:51.660 --> 2:11:56.300]  Conspiracy theory the war machine is back on paul joseph watson has the story at info wars
[2:11:57.260 --> 2:11:59.260]  dot com
[2:12:00.940 --> 2:12:02.940]  Of course, there's more
[2:12:02.940 --> 2:12:05.900]  taiwan reports large incursion by chinese air force
[2:12:06.940 --> 2:12:11.260]  Soldiers injured in fresh border skirmish between india and china
[2:12:11.660 --> 2:12:15.820]  And now foreign companies are giving up on the united states and betting big on china according to the
[2:12:15.820 --> 2:12:17.820]  cnn report
[2:12:17.820 --> 2:12:19.820]  If you believe that
[2:12:20.860 --> 2:12:22.860]  Oh, but uh
[2:12:23.820 --> 2:12:27.820]  Biden is gonna stand up to china though. Mm-hmm
[2:12:31.820 --> 2:12:33.820]  Hmm
[2:12:33.820 --> 2:12:35.820]  Very very sad
[2:12:35.820 --> 2:12:37.820]  And now the democrats
[2:12:37.820 --> 2:12:39.820]  This is really just next level
[2:12:39.820 --> 2:12:43.820]  This is one of those things I didn't think I'd witness. I knew it would come eventually
[2:12:43.820 --> 2:12:47.420]  I didn't think I'd be the one to witness it or or be in the crosshairs of it
[2:12:48.300 --> 2:12:50.300]  Tulsi cabard gets it
[2:12:50.300 --> 2:12:55.420]  She says the domestic terrorism bill being proposed by the democrats is the targeting of almost half the country. Yeah, that's
[2:12:56.300 --> 2:12:59.740]  That's the point. But see it's Pelosi that's scared
[2:13:00.300 --> 2:13:02.300]  Because she's the real criminal
[2:13:03.420 --> 2:13:09.260]  That's why they need all that military force in dc because they're scared. They know that we know they're criminals
[2:13:10.140 --> 2:13:12.620]  But they they know that we know they're criminals
[2:13:12.620 --> 2:13:17.580]  But they but see they're so arrogant. They're so punkish. They're so snobby
[2:13:19.500 --> 2:13:25.340]  They still treat them like total garbage. I mean that is the sociopathic psychotic element
[2:13:26.220 --> 2:13:31.340]  Of these politicians that are living in fear now because they've committed crimes and we all know about it
[2:13:32.300 --> 2:13:34.300]  We can read the us code
[2:13:35.980 --> 2:13:37.660]  So we know
[2:13:37.660 --> 2:13:39.420]  And they know we know
[2:13:39.420 --> 2:13:42.780]  They've been caught red-handed stealing elections. I don't think there are any legitimate elections
[2:13:43.340 --> 2:13:49.260]  In fact, you know, I was even thinking about this. Remember aoc pulls off the big big upset victory over that top tier democrat
[2:13:49.500 --> 2:13:52.460]  They probably stole that probably totally fake. It's all totally fake
[2:13:54.140 --> 2:13:58.540]  But see they don't even have the common decency. They don't even have that human touch
[2:13:59.260 --> 2:14:01.260]  To act like they care about the military
[2:14:01.260 --> 2:14:08.860]  They still treat them like garbage making them sleep on cold cement making them sleep in masks taking away their ammunition in magazines
[2:14:09.820 --> 2:14:17.180]  Because that's the essence of who these politicians are. That's the essence of dc. That's the essence of the democrat party
[2:14:21.100 --> 2:14:26.140]  Like hey, you know, you stick a guy up give me your wallet, you know, give me your jewelry
[2:14:26.940 --> 2:14:28.940]  It's okay. Okay fine fine
[2:14:28.940 --> 2:14:33.900]  You hand over the wallet you hand over the jewelry no one gets hurt. All right. Here's the wallet. Here's the jewelry
[2:14:34.540 --> 2:14:38.380]  And then they just decided to shoot you in the leg and kick you in the head a couple times just for fun
[2:14:39.660 --> 2:14:41.660]  That that's the essence of the sociopathic
[2:14:42.540 --> 2:14:44.540]  psychotic politicians
[2:14:45.420 --> 2:14:47.420]  And yeah, they mean it
[2:14:47.980 --> 2:14:49.980]  They mean it. They're coming for you
[2:14:51.260 --> 2:14:55.580]  The hillhead line lawmakers moved to oust extremists from military. I think you know what that means
[2:14:55.580 --> 2:15:01.900]  One in five people charged in connection with the riot have some form of military background
[2:15:02.140 --> 2:15:04.140]  Yeah, they signed up to defend the country
[2:15:04.620 --> 2:15:09.660]  You're attacking the country every day politically. Biden's attacking the country every day with his legislation
[2:15:11.340 --> 2:15:15.180]  The media the democrats are attacking the country every day when they censor free speech
[2:15:15.260 --> 2:15:19.980]  Biden just proposed a tax on firearms. That's an attack on the country. So yeah
[2:15:19.980 --> 2:15:26.140]  The military that signed an oath to the seat. Here's what it is. But here's the real headline for big league politics
[2:15:26.380 --> 2:15:30.860]  Democrats moved to ban trump supporters from joining the military and holding federal jobs
[2:15:33.980 --> 2:15:35.980]  See
[2:15:36.060 --> 2:15:42.700]  It's all about a total rewrite of american culture and just to make you afraid to breathe
[2:15:45.660 --> 2:15:47.900]  It's just unbelievable man, I mean they're they're they're
[2:15:47.900 --> 2:15:53.580]  Totally out of control and now they feel more empowered because they stole an election in broad daylight
[2:15:53.660 --> 2:15:58.060]  Hey, everybody confused about staying healthy in a crazy covet culture me too
[2:15:58.380 --> 2:16:02.620]  But listen after all the research all the conflicting studies after all the squabbling
[2:16:02.700 --> 2:16:09.580]  There's one thing almost everyone agrees on. It's that immune system health can literally be the difference between life and death
[2:16:09.900 --> 2:16:13.500]  You probably already believe that I certainly do. So here's the thing

[2:17:57.100 --> 2:18:00.300]  That's what George Herbert Walker Bush signed on to at the
[2:18:01.180 --> 2:18:05.500]  Rio de Janeiro Agenda 21 conference back in 1992
[2:18:06.380 --> 2:18:12.380]  Now they've launched Agenda 2030 which is a post industrial world plow schwa with the Davis Group
[2:18:12.860 --> 2:18:15.260]  Trudeau the Prime Minister of Canada they're all on record saying
[2:18:15.900 --> 2:18:19.020]  The great reset is Agenda 2030
[2:18:19.020 --> 2:18:23.660]  Well, you might want to find out what Agenda 2030 is. It is the destruction
[2:18:24.300 --> 2:18:30.380]  Of society as we know it. It is making the population more by designs. We can be controlled with a medical

[2:19:45.660 --> 2:19:48.220]  Head to info wars store.com today
[2:19:48.220 --> 2:20:00.220]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:20:00.220 --> 2:20:22.300]  See it's all about the new world order the globalist agenda anything else out of that is considered strange
[2:20:23.420 --> 2:20:25.980]  Even if it's logical and common sense for example
[2:20:25.980 --> 2:20:32.700]  The FBI is now admitting they have not opened a single case on a blm or antifa group
[2:20:33.180 --> 2:20:38.700]  While there are hundreds of cases opened right now on people that stormed the capital
[2:20:40.460 --> 2:20:45.980]  See that's the democrats who now own the political infrastructure and have weaponized the bureaucracies
[2:20:46.860 --> 2:20:50.140]  And the media is just there as their safety net
[2:20:51.020 --> 2:20:53.980]  To make sure that we the slaves don't get out of line, but but
[2:20:53.980 --> 2:20:58.220]  I want to go back to this real quick and then we're going to first time callers
[2:21:01.500 --> 2:21:08.380]  Because it's all the same with them going after American patriots and Trump supporters with the entire
[2:21:09.980 --> 2:21:12.460]  Reach and force of law enforcement, but ignoring the real
[2:21:13.340 --> 2:21:15.100]  domestic terrorists that
[2:21:15.100 --> 2:21:19.500]  Caused 2.2 billion dollars in property damage this year not a single investigation opened not a one
[2:21:20.140 --> 2:21:22.140]  Democrats say it's a myth. It doesn't even exist
[2:21:22.140 --> 2:21:27.260]  But then they'll turn around and justify it on television as it's happening call it peaceful
[2:21:29.180 --> 2:21:32.620]  But so this really if you can understand this
[2:21:34.220 --> 2:21:37.660]  And maybe people can't get it. Maybe they really can't wrap their head around it
[2:21:37.660 --> 2:21:43.420]  Maybe they've taken so many drugs drank so much fluoride that they really can't even get this
[2:21:43.420 --> 2:21:52.220]  The revelation that one in five people charged in connection with the riot may have some form of military background
[2:21:53.340 --> 2:21:55.340]  Now I reported on that first because it was obvious
[2:21:56.540 --> 2:21:58.540]  But see
[2:21:59.340 --> 2:22:01.340]  When Americans sign up
[2:22:01.980 --> 2:22:08.380]  After the media lies about a terror attack or the media lies about weapons of mass destruction or the media lies about babies and incubators
[2:22:09.580 --> 2:22:11.580]  And Americans sign up
[2:22:11.580 --> 2:22:13.580]  And Americans sign up for that
[2:22:14.140 --> 2:22:18.220]  And then they get put into the system of the military industrial complex
[2:22:18.860 --> 2:22:23.980]  Okay, we'll fly them around the world. We'll send them on missions. Whatever. It's part of the plan
[2:22:25.020 --> 2:22:27.020]  It's part of the
[2:22:27.900 --> 2:22:29.900]  Normal everyday activity
[2:22:30.860 --> 2:22:35.980]  But you see then when the same people that put their name on the line put their lives on the line to go overseas
[2:22:35.980 --> 2:22:41.100]  When they see that happening in their country and they want to take action, then they're not allowed
[2:22:42.380 --> 2:22:44.380]  And so if you understand that you understand everything
[2:22:45.420 --> 2:22:49.980]  The corporate world government runs our military the military industrial complex runs our military
[2:22:51.580 --> 2:22:58.060]  And so as soon as they are not in the system of the new world order going to wherever they're told to go to
[2:22:58.060 --> 2:23:00.380]  Whether it's vietnam or iraq or iran, wherever
[2:23:00.380 --> 2:23:08.700]  That's good. That's praise. That's accepted. That's the military industrial complex funds the media funds the ratings. They're good for it
[2:23:08.700 --> 2:23:12.140]  But oh if a single one of those guys
[2:23:13.260 --> 2:23:16.460]  Dare say that there's something wrong with what's happening here in america
[2:23:17.020 --> 2:23:20.860]  Dare say it's Pelosi dare say it's biden who are the criminals
[2:23:21.580 --> 2:23:24.860]  Well, see then they become the criminals they get arrested
[2:23:25.500 --> 2:23:28.300]  They get their free speech taken they get their
[2:23:28.300 --> 2:23:30.300]  Second amendment taken
[2:23:33.020 --> 2:23:37.100]  And see the the diabolical nature of that shows you how screwed up it is
[2:23:40.460 --> 2:23:42.460]  The nonsensical
[2:23:45.020 --> 2:23:50.940]  Bad formula that doesn't add up shows you how corrupt the world has become
[2:23:50.940 --> 2:23:57.660]  And I can't even imagine what it's like for some of these veterans
[2:23:58.140 --> 2:24:03.020]  Who are told go over there and fight go over there and put your life on the line. That's the military industrial complex
[2:24:03.020 --> 2:24:05.020]  That's the system but as soon as they come home
[2:24:05.260 --> 2:24:08.940]  They're told their piece is a garbage and they can't even defend their own country
[2:24:09.420 --> 2:24:11.900]  Which they just flew halfway around the world to do allegedly
[2:24:15.500 --> 2:24:18.780]  But now you're seeing the disgust now you're seeing the hatred
[2:24:18.780 --> 2:24:21.900]  And that the political establishment has for our military
[2:24:23.580 --> 2:24:27.980]  With democrat lawmakers like anthony brown saying and I quote
[2:24:29.340 --> 2:24:35.500]  The attack on our capital was an insurrection fueled in large part by groups that espouse the same extreme white supremacist views
[2:24:35.740 --> 2:24:41.180]  That actively recruit veterans and form ranks of our military. So now the entire military is white supremacist
[2:24:41.820 --> 2:24:46.700]  And even though they couldn't point out a single white supremacist at any of these events a single organization
[2:24:46.700 --> 2:24:52.620]  At any of these events that espouses any white supremacist ideologies. It doesn't matter
[2:24:52.860 --> 2:24:55.900]  By the way, they can espouse their black supremacist ideologies all day long
[2:24:55.900 --> 2:24:58.700]  There's about three of them on the biden administration. Fine. I don't care
[2:24:59.260 --> 2:25:00.460]  But see
[2:25:00.460 --> 2:25:08.140]  That's their low IQ lowest common denominator argument is that you just say oh white supremacy and then immediately everything's demonized
[2:25:09.740 --> 2:25:11.740]  It's incredible
[2:25:13.100 --> 2:25:15.100]  It's so evil
[2:25:15.100 --> 2:25:17.100]  It's so disgusting
[2:25:17.260 --> 2:25:18.540]  And it's so obvious
[2:25:18.540 --> 2:25:24.620]  Yeah, there's biden saying clap you stupid bastard. Yeah, he cares about the military. He cares enough to send you to die in another war
[2:25:26.300 --> 2:25:29.980]  Just like he cared to vote for to send you to die in every war that ever came up before
[2:25:31.260 --> 2:25:33.260]  Nowadays he doesn't even know what's going on though
[2:25:34.140 --> 2:25:39.980]  All right, let's go back to the phone lines. Oh, but don't worry. Uh biden cares so much
[2:25:39.980 --> 2:25:46.860]  Biden cares so much about the military. He's gonna make sure that there's transgender people back in the military
[2:25:49.020 --> 2:25:54.700]  And he says he's gonna bring unity to the middle east, you know what that means about 30 moabs coming your way
[2:25:55.180 --> 2:25:58.460]  All right, uh to the phone lines first time callers
[2:25:59.180 --> 2:26:03.180]  We start with derrick in new hampshire derrick. You're on the alex joneshow. Go ahead
[2:26:03.180 --> 2:26:09.740]  Hey, how you doing? Um, first of all, I'd like to salute you. You're like a soldier in the info war
[2:26:10.460 --> 2:26:15.900]  Um, I equate this whole last year, you know, the coronavirus since the coronavirus anyways to
[2:26:16.540 --> 2:26:19.740]  That movie they live. I don't know if you've seen that movie but
[2:26:20.460 --> 2:26:25.740]  Where you needed a special pair of glasses to see what was going on and you guys are the glasses
[2:26:26.860 --> 2:26:32.300]  I feel like every time I try to tell somebody what's going on. I'm not the best debater
[2:26:32.300 --> 2:26:36.460]  Um, I'm a fisherman and I drive an oil truck in the off season
[2:26:37.020 --> 2:26:39.580]  And uh, so I guess I'm really screwed but um
[2:26:40.460 --> 2:26:47.500]  I'm not the best debater. So, you know, biden biden is literally attacking both of your uh, both of your professions fishing and oil
[2:26:47.500 --> 2:26:49.500]  He wants to cancel them both. Oh, that's something
[2:26:50.300 --> 2:26:53.660]  Yeah, yeah at both of them boats and oil. I don't know
[2:26:54.460 --> 2:26:56.460]  I guess I'll
[2:26:56.460 --> 2:26:58.220]  Never mind
[2:26:58.220 --> 2:27:03.820]  What was I saying before info war is they live the glasses info wars they live? That's right
[2:27:03.980 --> 2:27:08.300]  So the glasses you guys are the glasses and every time I try to tell somebody what's going on
[2:27:08.300 --> 2:27:09.820]  I'm such a horrible debater
[2:27:09.820 --> 2:27:15.180]  You know the fight scene that really long fight scene where you're really trying to get Keith david to wear those glasses
[2:27:15.500 --> 2:27:20.860]  I feel like that that's what i'm doing every time I talk to somebody and I never get them to wear the glasses
[2:27:21.180 --> 2:27:26.540]  I somebody called earlier about an app. There should be an app something that we can go to really quick to go
[2:27:26.540 --> 2:27:29.740]  All right, libtard. This is really what's going on
[2:27:30.060 --> 2:27:34.460]  And this is a fact and this is a fact and this is a fact and then there's the glasses
[2:27:34.700 --> 2:27:39.100]  But that's not why I called. Um, the reason why I called is I saw a documentary
[2:27:39.580 --> 2:27:42.300]  On amazon of all places. I'm surprised they haven't pulled it
[2:27:42.620 --> 2:27:49.180]  But it's called hidden agenda real conspiracies that affect our lives today and it was produced in 2017
[2:27:49.180 --> 2:27:54.460]  But it's a compilation of a lot of documentaries that were made back in the 60s a lot of it's in black and white
[2:27:54.460 --> 2:28:00.620]  And it's like eight episodes. I've only seen four so far, but I watched three twice
[2:28:01.020 --> 2:28:05.500]  And it made me call because ronald reagan narrates one of them in like
[2:28:06.220 --> 2:28:13.500]  1962 it's almost like you can feel like that when he was narrating this this was like energizing him to get into politics
[2:28:14.140 --> 2:28:16.140]  and everything that they said in there
[2:28:16.780 --> 2:28:20.540]  To a tee is what's been happening over the last four years
[2:28:20.540 --> 2:28:27.180]  And this is communism folks. And if you don't believe it go watch this documentary hidden agenda
[2:28:27.580 --> 2:28:32.460]  Real conspiracies that affect our lives today and I swear you're going to be breathless
[2:28:33.500 --> 2:28:35.500]  Derek thank you for the call
[2:28:35.580 --> 2:28:37.580]  and you know as far as the
[2:28:38.220 --> 2:28:44.220]  Facts don't matter libtards out there. I don't know if there's any hope for them. They've already bought into the lie
[2:28:44.220 --> 2:28:45.820]  They kind of like that
[2:28:45.820 --> 2:28:48.460]  But you know what there's going to be a lot of voters remorse for biden
[2:28:48.460 --> 2:28:52.620]  It's already happening. So so a lot of democrats are about to wake up and realize how bad it is
[2:28:53.900 --> 2:28:59.580]  The word apocalypse means the revealing of what was once hidden
[2:29:00.860 --> 2:29:03.740]  And now that all the lies are being revealed
[2:29:04.460 --> 2:29:06.460]  What will you do?
[2:29:07.180 --> 2:29:10.300]  We know that millions will do absolutely nothing

[2:31:01.820 --> 2:31:05.020]  They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement
[2:31:05.660 --> 2:31:10.780]  Imitating from the united states that spread across the world from the uk to brazil
[2:31:11.740 --> 2:31:14.700]  They were desperate. They admitted their own publications. They didn't know what to do
[2:31:16.140 --> 2:31:19.260]  And so they put out 80 million fake ballots violated state law
[2:31:19.260 --> 2:31:21.260]  And stole it better than doubt

[2:33:17.580 --> 2:33:30.620]  So I'm going to take some more phone calls here. We have a special report from alex jones jail. Solante then takes over
[2:33:30.620 --> 2:33:34.700]  So we do have some other news developing. I will get to that covering
[2:33:35.340 --> 2:33:39.340]  That news on the war room today, but I want to go back to the first time callers now
[2:33:40.540 --> 2:33:46.540]  And we go to dave in kansas. You're on the alex jones show dave go ahead
[2:33:47.820 --> 2:33:49.820]  Yeah, thanks for letting me in
[2:33:50.380 --> 2:33:56.140]  People in power for over 40 years are blaming ever all of the problems of the united states on trump
[2:33:56.140 --> 2:34:05.100]  With the organizational power the info wars has can it be mobilized like to stop the steel to help bypass congress to get term limits
[2:34:06.140 --> 2:34:08.140]  So much power in congress
[2:34:08.940 --> 2:34:11.420]  So that too much congress in power is limited
[2:34:12.300 --> 2:34:17.100]  Most of the people I know would really like to see term limits, but have no organizations to make it happen
[2:34:17.900 --> 2:34:21.900]  China joe would be irreverent irrelevant if term limits existed
[2:34:21.900 --> 2:34:26.380]  Pelosi schumer all those would be totally irrelevant
[2:34:27.260 --> 2:34:30.620]  And it would be much harder for the deep state to gain control
[2:34:31.340 --> 2:34:32.460]  Over our congress
[2:34:32.460 --> 2:34:34.700]  If term limits were involved
[2:34:35.580 --> 2:34:37.580]  Well, I'm not really sure what
[2:34:37.820 --> 2:34:41.500]  Info wars would do about that. I mean if anything if we tried to spearhead that they would just
[2:34:42.380 --> 2:34:44.380]  Demonize it and hate it even more
[2:34:45.020 --> 2:34:49.020]  I know republicans have pushed for that in the past democrats have pushed for that
[2:34:49.020 --> 2:34:54.380]  So, uh, I'm not really sure what what what info wars would do organizationally
[2:34:55.340 --> 2:34:57.340]  To implement something like that
[2:34:58.460 --> 2:35:00.460]  The reason I reason I talked to you about it
[2:35:01.500 --> 2:35:04.460]  You can get a million people to come to stop the steel
[2:35:05.420 --> 2:35:06.940]  If we had a rally
[2:35:06.940 --> 2:35:08.380]  in
[2:35:08.380 --> 2:35:12.380]  Austin in Dallas wherever to get people to sign that
[2:35:13.660 --> 2:35:15.660]  Form and get it delivered
[2:35:15.660 --> 2:35:21.020]  So that the legislatures would have to deal with it and have to put it on the ballot
[2:35:21.580 --> 2:35:25.820]  Yeah, in fact, there is a petition that's already live right now guys. Where is this term limits on congress petition?
[2:35:27.820 --> 2:35:33.020]  Uh, I can't see where that's at, but uh, it's a petition. So the petition already exists
[2:35:33.020 --> 2:35:44.460]  We're in kind of a powder keg of free speech activity right now where
[2:35:45.820 --> 2:35:52.220]  Any free speech any organizing like you're proposing is right for a false flag
[2:35:53.020 --> 2:35:57.580]  So, uh, I think that the day will come when we have to get back out on the streets maybe sooner than later
[2:35:57.580 --> 2:35:59.580]  But we're gonna have to have a serious
[2:35:59.580 --> 2:36:03.260]  Discussion about how we approach that
[2:36:04.460 --> 2:36:06.460]  Knowing how we were set up on the 6th
[2:36:06.940 --> 2:36:08.940]  And knowing how they want to set us up in the future
[2:36:09.740 --> 2:36:14.700]  My goal is to unite with the anti establishment left as much as we have
[2:36:15.100 --> 2:36:19.340]  Uh, or or I guess even if we have nothing in common politically
[2:36:20.060 --> 2:36:24.220]  I would rather unite with the left to defeat the newer loader than be fighting with the left to be defeated by the new world
[2:36:24.220 --> 2:36:30.380]  Loader so then maybe if you could do something like that, it could ease a little bit because most of that is just going to be the left trying to set us up
[2:36:30.380 --> 2:36:34.140]  But uh, uh, yeah term limits would be nice
[2:36:34.220 --> 2:36:40.700]  You wouldn't have the rotting corpses that have enriched themselves with the tunes of hundred and millions of dollars like Pelosi and Biden in there if you did
[2:36:41.180 --> 2:36:47.500]  Uh, I'm just not sure if info wars really is the one to spearhead that but there are already groups doing that and petitions are out there
[2:36:47.500 --> 2:36:49.500]  So, uh, go sign those and share those
[2:36:49.500 --> 2:36:55.420]  Uh, if uh, if you really want to see that get somewhere Dave. Thanks for the call. Let's go to
[2:36:56.140 --> 2:36:59.980]  Devin in Ohio Devin. You're on the alex joneshow. Go ahead
[2:37:01.020 --> 2:37:02.220]  I own
[2:37:02.220 --> 2:37:08.220]  Thanks for taking my call. I wanted to let you know, uh, so i'm a senior in high school a lot of people my age
[2:37:08.780 --> 2:37:10.780]  Including myself use instagram
[2:37:11.020 --> 2:37:15.020]  One of the first things I did after the election was unfollow the white house account
[2:37:16.220 --> 2:37:18.220]  And so the next day
[2:37:18.220 --> 2:37:24.380]  It pops up in my feed and it says i'm following it again. I didn't follow it again. So I was like, okay, that's weird
[2:37:24.940 --> 2:37:27.820]  Um, about a week passes. I unfollowed again
[2:37:28.700 --> 2:37:30.700]  I've been unfollowing it for a while
[2:37:30.860 --> 2:37:33.260]  And then it comes in my feet again and says i'm following it
[2:37:33.980 --> 2:37:35.980]  And so I was at work scrolling through my feed
[2:37:36.620 --> 2:37:38.620]  Yesterday when I was on break
[2:37:39.180 --> 2:37:43.340]  And it said I was following it again, even though I keep on following it. So I go to the comments
[2:37:44.300 --> 2:37:46.300]  and it was like this
[2:37:46.300 --> 2:37:50.380]  The thing that popped in my feed was like a video of Fauci saying please wear a mask. So I went to the comments
[2:37:50.860 --> 2:37:52.860]  Just about every other comment
[2:37:53.020 --> 2:37:57.820]  Where people saying why can't I follow this account? Why do they keep so I think instagram is
[2:37:59.020 --> 2:38:02.140]  Faking followers for that white for biden's white house account
[2:38:02.860 --> 2:38:08.140]  Yeah, absolutely. We have the story and the screenshots at info wars.com on this exact story
[2:38:08.780 --> 2:38:13.180]  I was getting inundated with messages. I guess it was yes sunday morning saying the same thing
[2:38:13.180 --> 2:38:19.020]  And it's not only instagram folks. They're not only forcing people to follow the white house on instagram to make biden seem popular
[2:38:19.420 --> 2:38:21.180]  They are disabling
[2:38:21.180 --> 2:38:26.860]  Comments on youtube because all the comments are calling joe biden pedophile saying that he didn't win the election and trump won
[2:38:26.860 --> 2:38:27.900]  So they just
[2:38:27.900 --> 2:38:29.900]  um canceled the comments
[2:38:29.900 --> 2:38:31.900]  And then they're also removing the dislikes
[2:38:32.620 --> 2:38:36.780]  From the biden speeches as well because it was like 10 to 1 dislikes to likes
[2:38:37.340 --> 2:38:40.780]  So biden is the most unpopular person to ever be in the white house
[2:38:40.780 --> 2:38:46.380]  The biden hairs administration is is already the most unpopular and they haven't even been in for a month
[2:38:46.540 --> 2:38:50.140]  But they've done so much damage to this country so much damage to their own reputation
[2:38:50.460 --> 2:38:52.460]  Just proven liars and frauds at this point
[2:38:53.180 --> 2:38:55.180]  Uh, so in a way, it's a good thing
[2:38:55.820 --> 2:39:03.340]  That americans are waking up and having voters remorse with how bad biden is and and how flippant they are in their censorship and their
[2:39:03.900 --> 2:39:05.020]  um
[2:39:05.020 --> 2:39:07.020]  manipulation of perceived reality
[2:39:07.020 --> 2:39:11.020]  So, you know, what where do they go next?
[2:39:11.020 --> 2:39:17.020]  So they're they'll they'll make you watch a biden speech next because literally nobody wants to they'll say you have to watch a biden speech
[2:39:17.020 --> 2:39:19.020]  We'll arrest you. Uh, devin. Thanks for the call
[2:39:20.060 --> 2:39:25.020]  Let's go to tyler in north carolina tyler. You're on the alex joneshow. Go ahead
[2:39:26.300 --> 2:39:30.140]  I won't appreciate taking the time man. Here's the reason I started watching info wars
[2:39:31.020 --> 2:39:33.020]  Um, I got a phone call from a waft a little bit ago
[2:39:33.020 --> 2:39:36.220]  Um, she's a therapist at a rehab center. I'll just leave it at that
[2:39:37.020 --> 2:39:43.020]  So according to their corporate policy, you know, this is a company that only that manages facilities across the country
[2:39:45.020 --> 2:39:51.020]  If you do not take a covid vaccine, they are no longer going to allow you to use pto time that you approve
[2:39:51.980 --> 2:39:53.980]  To be off work when you're sick
[2:39:53.980 --> 2:39:59.020]  Now my wife is four months pregnant and they're trying to pressure her into a vaccine
[2:39:59.020 --> 2:40:03.020]  People really have to start waking up to the fact of what we're in and where we're headed
[2:40:03.980 --> 2:40:09.020]  So her facility those rapid tests, which we all know are inaccurate every day
[2:40:09.020 --> 2:40:11.500]  So what happens when she comes in one day?
[2:40:12.460 --> 2:40:17.580]  And the test positive now whether she's sick or not and they send her home for a mandatory two weeks
[2:40:18.140 --> 2:40:20.140]  That she cannot get time off for
[2:40:20.220 --> 2:40:22.220]  They only hold her job for six weeks
[2:40:23.020 --> 2:40:27.020]  All they have to do is get her three positive tests and she no longer has time to do it
[2:40:27.020 --> 2:40:29.580]  Get her three positive tests and she no longer has a job
[2:40:33.580 --> 2:40:36.140]  Yeah, I mean, uh, it's a horrible situation
[2:40:36.220 --> 2:40:41.420]  There this is the medical tyranny and of course it's being rolled out to the the medical industry first
[2:40:41.820 --> 2:40:44.460]  To indoctrinate them into it so that then they have that
[2:40:45.020 --> 2:40:49.340]  Implied pressure to to bring everybody else into the system. That's basic psychology
[2:40:50.220 --> 2:40:55.580]  200 and another thing I want you guys to read into I don't I've never heard you covered on the show
[2:40:55.580 --> 2:40:59.020]  Um, have you read into blue walls in the new green deal?
[2:41:00.140 --> 2:41:01.900]  blue walls
[2:41:01.900 --> 2:41:03.180]  blue walls
[2:41:03.180 --> 2:41:04.780]  no
[2:41:04.780 --> 2:41:06.780]  Okay, so they're actually talking about this
[2:41:07.340 --> 2:41:13.260]  In Italy already. It's a big push from the catholic church. This is why they're kind of involved and the whole, you know
[2:41:13.900 --> 2:41:16.460]  Climate change and all this sort of crap
[2:41:18.620 --> 2:41:24.300]  Martin words people what they're gonna start pushing for is we get closer to the end and everybody needs to go home and read
[2:41:24.300 --> 2:41:26.300]  Ezekiel 2020
[2:41:27.500 --> 2:41:32.860]  They're gonna start pushing for a mandatory day of worship and this is already in the new green deal
[2:41:33.180 --> 2:41:38.140]  They're gonna say, oh, look how much pollution is saved, you know, if everybody just sits at home one day
[2:41:38.540 --> 2:41:43.340]  They're gonna start persecution Christians dependent on the day of worship if it differs from theirs
[2:41:44.140 --> 2:41:49.100]  And and this is in the deal you can read this for yourself and they've had blue walls in the past in other countries
[2:41:49.500 --> 2:41:51.500]  So just read into it
[2:41:51.500 --> 2:41:54.940]  Yeah, and of course they were even trying to push that at the beginning of kovat
[2:41:54.940 --> 2:41:56.940]  It didn't really take off
[2:41:56.940 --> 2:42:02.220]  Saying, oh look, we're doing such great things for the earth and the climate and the environment total lie
[2:42:02.220 --> 2:42:06.540]  There was no science. In fact, science actually shows now it's been worse for the environment
[2:42:07.500 --> 2:42:09.980]  Uh with the masks polluting the
[2:42:11.260 --> 2:42:13.660]  Roads polluting the waters. I mean, so
[2:42:14.780 --> 2:42:20.060]  It's just crazy, man. I mean, it's just I can't be yeah, there's blue law right there the crew pulled it up
[2:42:20.060 --> 2:42:23.420]  But yeah, they'll say, oh, you know, you have to eat bugs if you're going to eat
[2:42:24.060 --> 2:42:29.020]  Drink your own urine if you're going to drink, uh, you know, otherwise you're killing the planet and you're a criminal
[2:42:29.660 --> 2:42:33.100]  So, you know, it's amazing these people believe in evolution like we're all animals
[2:42:33.100 --> 2:42:36.060]  But then they want to act like they can somehow control the planet
[2:42:37.580 --> 2:42:45.180]  As if they're divine created beings, but then they'll announce that too. So incredible special report coming up from Alex Jones next
[2:42:45.180 --> 2:42:49.180]  Ladies and gentlemen during this short break go to internet.com

[2:43:31.420 --> 2:43:38.060]  So prepare alex.com or infowarstore.com you can find the preparedness section there water filtration air filtration
[2:43:38.140 --> 2:43:41.900]  It's all there the technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the force gmo and more
[2:43:41.980 --> 2:43:44.620]  It's time to start getting prepared it starts with self-defense
[2:43:44.620 --> 2:43:49.580]  It starts with a being prepared it starts the storeable food it starts with digging in with a long globalist fight
[2:43:49.660 --> 2:43:51.660]  You'll let in the end
[2:43:53.500 --> 2:43:58.540]  We told you it was coming under the united nations pilot program in singapore for eight months
[2:43:58.540 --> 2:44:05.100]  They've made citizens wear bracelets on their arms that makes them a social distance and report them back to cell towers
[2:44:05.180 --> 2:44:08.220]  Attractor every movement. This is for everybody the way it gets better
[2:44:08.220 --> 2:44:15.580]  Now france has programs in their factories government push and sponsor to make everyone wear actual dog callers
[2:44:16.060 --> 2:44:21.100]  You can make your social distance and report back to single computers. They're turning us into a commodity
[2:44:21.580 --> 2:44:25.180]  Human animal clones have been around for 50 years. It's all being announced
[2:44:25.260 --> 2:44:31.500]  They are literally taking over the life cycle of humans and making us obsolete and big corporations downplay that they own us
[2:44:31.820 --> 2:44:34.780]  With the gene therapy systems and patents that they produced
[2:44:34.780 --> 2:44:39.500]  Do you understand it is a takeover of the entire species of the genetic level?
[2:44:39.740 --> 2:44:44.860]  And now they're coming with dog callers and they're announcing in public schools in the us starting next year
[2:44:44.860 --> 2:44:50.540]  It will begin. Did you hear me dog callers for your children all based on a hoax all based on a lie
[2:44:50.860 --> 2:44:52.940]  Info wars continue to spread the word to fight back
[2:44:54.860 --> 2:44:58.700]  The great reset where have I heard of that before oh the great
[2:44:58.700 --> 2:45:04.460]  Leap forward Mao Zedong ordering all the small towns and small farms
[2:45:04.860 --> 2:45:11.980]  To basically shut down and have the rural people and the small business people move into the big cities and go under communist commune control
[2:45:12.700 --> 2:45:16.860]  And that's all this is the big mega banks want to break us of the same ones that put Mao Zedong into power
[2:45:17.420 --> 2:45:22.220]  And they're creating the process of getting rid of our old economy and bringing in the new economy where everything's free
[2:45:23.100 --> 2:45:26.540]  Because when you're a prisoner, well, everything's free, but you're also a slave
[2:45:26.540 --> 2:45:31.260]  But Scotland is going to have universal guaranteed incomes now of subsistence level
[2:45:31.580 --> 2:45:36.700]  But of course you got to take those vaccines. You can't have any kids and oh, don't worry though all of the
[2:45:37.340 --> 2:45:40.940]  Campons and and stuff like that's free too as well. I'm not kidding
[2:45:41.740 --> 2:45:45.660]  So they'll give you some free paper. They give you enough money to basically live in a tiny apartment
[2:45:45.740 --> 2:45:51.580]  But they own you they control you. That's the great reset. That's why it's got to be resisted to total takeover
[2:45:51.580 --> 2:45:53.580]  And we're fighting it at info wars.com
[2:45:53.580 --> 2:45:55.580]  I
[2:45:55.740 --> 2:46:01.660]  Love the patriot blend wake up America coffee. I just love it. I can't get enough of it
[2:46:02.700 --> 2:46:07.260]  We've got a fresh brew right now. That's what fills my mug. That's what fills my belly

[2:46:40.460 --> 2:46:44.620]  It's uh impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gives it five stars
[2:46:44.620 --> 2:46:49.740]  So I mean if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it a five star except maybe one or two people patriot blend 100%
[2:46:49.740 --> 2:46:54.700]  Organic coffee only available at info wars store.com
[2:46:57.500 --> 2:47:00.140]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:04.620 --> 2:47:11.580]  It's now official the united states only six days in the joe biden's administration is now under martial law
[2:47:11.980 --> 2:47:16.220]  Martial law directed by the united nations and as we speak one of the key organizations
[2:47:16.220 --> 2:47:20.540]  Quarterbacking the global takeover the devos group is meeting plotting their next steps
[2:47:27.020 --> 2:47:33.020]  Outgoing hawaiian congresswoman tulsi gabards called out the elephant in the room over the weekend and asked
[2:47:33.580 --> 2:47:35.420]  president biden
[2:47:35.420 --> 2:47:37.420]  Are we under martial law?
[2:47:37.580 --> 2:47:40.940]  Well, that's like asking a member of the mafia if they're a gangster
[2:47:41.580 --> 2:47:45.020]  Yes, we're under a civil emergency. Yes, we're under martial law
[2:47:45.020 --> 2:47:48.060]  And it's directed by the united nations
[2:47:48.540 --> 2:47:50.540]  It is directed by the devos group
[2:47:50.940 --> 2:47:53.260]  It is directed by the globalist and they used
[2:47:53.740 --> 2:48:01.500]  COVID-19 is the initial way to put the lockdown or the political clampdown in place in all these countries that were unpopular like spain
[2:48:02.060 --> 2:48:02.940]  and
[2:48:02.940 --> 2:48:07.980]  France where the leaders were set to be toppled where they had basically open
[2:48:08.620 --> 2:48:11.820]  Civil war starting with the yellow jackets and the rest of it
[2:48:11.820 --> 2:48:19.180]  And suddenly they had the excuse to clamp down and what's really frustrating is none of this is even a secret the entire planet
[2:48:20.140 --> 2:48:21.180]  Back in
[2:48:21.180 --> 2:48:28.220]  February and march of 2020 was put under united nations directed global lockdown
[2:48:28.460 --> 2:48:30.460]  We were told the WHO is in charge
[2:48:31.180 --> 2:48:33.180]  governments are taking its orders
[2:48:33.420 --> 2:48:34.700]  Big tech is taking its orders
[2:48:34.700 --> 2:48:38.940]  It doesn't matter if thousands of doctors and scientists come out and say that covid's overblown
[2:48:38.940 --> 2:48:44.620]  Or the hydroxychloroquine is basically a cure or that they're listing people that died of other diseases
[2:48:45.740 --> 2:48:47.740]  As covid the same formula worldwide
[2:48:48.380 --> 2:48:51.980]  They were allowed to do it because it was a civil emergency and the un said
[2:48:52.460 --> 2:48:54.460]  Send covid patients to nursing homes
[2:48:55.020 --> 2:48:59.500]  The long group of people that covid actually has a good chance of killing for the rest of public
[2:48:59.580 --> 2:49:02.300]  It's 99.99999 that you can't die
[2:49:02.700 --> 2:49:06.140]  But yes, if you've had cancer if you're obese if you're above 75
[2:49:06.140 --> 2:49:08.700]  You are in trouble if you've got diabetes
[2:49:09.100 --> 2:49:11.260]  But again, this was their excuse to muzzle us
[2:49:11.900 --> 2:49:14.620]  both our speech online and physically in
[2:49:15.740 --> 2:49:17.980]  The real world and once that was in place
[2:49:19.020 --> 2:49:21.020]  All over the planet now they are putting
[2:49:21.340 --> 2:49:27.180]  permanent forms of martial law in place and saying they're going to have military on the streets, but more importantly
[2:49:28.060 --> 2:49:32.460]  They're announcing and the white house has officially done this through their spokesperson last friday
[2:49:32.460 --> 2:49:36.940]  That they are going to work with the defense department the fbi the cia
[2:49:37.020 --> 2:49:41.420]  That's all illegal to have those groups immensely operating with the fbi against
[2:49:42.380 --> 2:49:46.700]  The american people and they're going to create lists of people from religious extremists
[2:49:46.780 --> 2:49:49.260]  That's whoever they want pro-life people folks like that
[2:49:50.220 --> 2:49:52.220]  All the way to quote even libertarians
[2:49:52.620 --> 2:49:57.020]  Now that was bred in a few days before her that said that but then the white house
[2:49:57.420 --> 2:49:59.420]  Press secretary came out and she said indeed
[2:49:59.420 --> 2:50:01.980]  That's what we're doing, but but worse than that
[2:50:03.020 --> 2:50:05.020]  We're going to have the southern primary law center
[2:50:05.660 --> 2:50:07.660]  We're going to have the adl
[2:50:08.380 --> 2:50:10.780]  Actually create these lists and give them to us
[2:50:11.340 --> 2:50:14.860]  Those are the same groups that have created a list of who gets banned online
[2:50:15.900 --> 2:50:21.660]  Facebook when they named me as a dangerous person a few years ago and said that you can't even be nice to me if you talk
[2:50:22.300 --> 2:50:26.220]  positively of me the facebook cult will kick you off or even
[2:50:26.220 --> 2:50:32.940]  Remove you not just suspend you and it was all because the southern primary law center and adl who are like gods
[2:50:33.980 --> 2:50:37.500]  These fascist authoritarian gods said that i'm a bad person
[2:50:37.980 --> 2:50:41.020]  So that's how this works first said even eyes to me built a strong man
[2:50:41.580 --> 2:50:43.820]  Twisted things i'd said took things out of context
[2:50:44.620 --> 2:50:48.860]  Built this line that i should be removed unpersoned and then once that domino fell
[2:50:49.660 --> 2:50:51.660]  All the other dominoes fell
[2:50:51.660 --> 2:50:53.660]  That's the same thing with the capital
[2:50:53.660 --> 2:50:58.460]  Hundreds of thousands of people there the police stand down less than a hundred rioters
[2:50:59.580 --> 2:51:03.420]  Who we now know mainly work with the feds antifa and boogaloo connected groups
[2:51:03.900 --> 2:51:05.900]  Broke through and then some people excited
[2:51:06.380 --> 2:51:12.300]  Went into the capital and stayed within the velvet rubs and got a tour and now we're being told based on that
[2:51:12.860 --> 2:51:15.980]  America is going under a permanent civil emergency martial law
[2:51:17.340 --> 2:51:18.700]  and that
[2:51:18.700 --> 2:51:20.140]  We need to quote be
[2:51:20.140 --> 2:51:21.740]  routed out
[2:51:21.740 --> 2:51:26.700]  By the defense department the cia working with the fbi and again the fbi can operate domestically
[2:51:26.700 --> 2:51:32.620]  But when it works with the cia and or the defense department that is extremely illegal that is extremely dangerous and that's why
[2:51:33.340 --> 2:51:39.340]  Even the squad has come out and said this is wrong because they understand what's going on because they're connected to real terrorist
[2:51:39.580 --> 2:51:41.580]  And so even you know mainline
[2:51:41.580 --> 2:51:47.740]  Uh, you know terror connected democrats who are now given free rand america are scared because they understand that that could be aimed at them
[2:51:48.060 --> 2:51:49.660]  Legitimately in the future
[2:51:49.660 --> 2:51:54.220]  It's very important for me to reach out to any new viewers and listeners at this point
[2:51:55.100 --> 2:52:00.380]  And to beg you to go back and research globalist reports and documents from the last few decades
[2:52:00.940 --> 2:52:04.380]  So that when you understand this information is real and not my opinion
[2:52:04.620 --> 2:52:06.860]  You'll be forced to either submit to this takeover
[2:52:07.420 --> 2:52:12.140]  Or take action against it. I believe you'll take action against it. It needs your consent
[2:52:12.780 --> 2:52:14.780]  It needs you to submit
[2:52:14.780 --> 2:52:22.540]  The globalists are simply all the old money figuring out how to use technology and high tech manipulation to control populations
[2:52:23.500 --> 2:52:25.500]  And back in the 40s
[2:52:25.660 --> 2:52:31.980]  They tasked the carnegie endowment along the Rockefeller endowment to create a world without conflict
[2:52:32.060 --> 2:52:35.820]  You can go read these documents and they developed plans like seven two seven seven
[2:52:36.380 --> 2:52:40.140]  state department random and others and much of this has now been declassified
[2:52:40.140 --> 2:52:48.460]  Back in the 70s by anthony Sutton. That was the head archivist for the house and senate and he wrote several big books with those documents in it
[2:52:49.580 --> 2:52:51.740]  Anthony Sutton also first got the secret
[2:52:52.460 --> 2:52:57.020]  skull and bones documents from charlotte israbe whose father was a member of skull and bones
[2:52:57.020 --> 2:53:03.980]  So that's how we know of this plan and their argument is if they bring in a world government and they get rid of male and female
[2:53:05.020 --> 2:53:06.460]  for most
[2:53:06.460 --> 2:53:08.460]  of the commoners and and basically
[2:53:08.460 --> 2:53:10.460]  They chemicalize us from birth
[2:53:10.540 --> 2:53:13.900]  And just keep us they describe us as dwarf-like servant creatures
[2:53:14.700 --> 2:53:16.700]  You probably read this in brave new world
[2:53:17.020 --> 2:53:20.460]  Huxley wrote that in 32 his brother ran the u.n later
[2:53:20.860 --> 2:53:21.980]  UNESCO
[2:53:21.980 --> 2:53:29.020]  Julian Huxley and he later wrote brave new world revisited in 61 before he died saying this is actually our plan so
[2:53:29.660 --> 2:53:34.620]  Again, we're in 2021 now. You can see that we're in the science fiction realm. We're not in
[2:53:34.620 --> 2:53:39.020]  1932 and this group has envisioned this and they've done this
[2:53:39.660 --> 2:53:42.380]  Just like the Wright brothers, you know 100 something years ago
[2:53:42.780 --> 2:53:47.180]  Basically got a balsamut airplane to take off. It was bicycle power and then now we've got
[2:53:47.900 --> 2:53:51.340]  jets that go Mach 6 or you know space planes the rest of it so
[2:53:52.780 --> 2:53:56.380]  They envisioned all of this and they've been slowly setting it up and now that they have the
[2:53:56.860 --> 2:54:00.860]  Technocracy in place for trying to carry it out and they purposely wanted to give everybody in debt first
[2:54:01.500 --> 2:54:03.500]  so they've created
[2:54:03.500 --> 2:54:07.820]  So now it's about 10 quadrillion dollars just the united states alone
[2:54:08.460 --> 2:54:10.460]  Worldwide no one knows
[2:54:10.460 --> 2:54:15.180]  But we're talking about thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands and tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands
[2:54:15.660 --> 2:54:19.900]  Of just trillions of unlimited dollars. It's all made up. It's all fraudulent
[2:54:20.620 --> 2:54:24.460]  And they did this by selling mortgages 10 20 30 40 50 times
[2:54:25.020 --> 2:54:29.180]  Uh 100 times in some cases and now it's so astronomical
[2:54:29.180 --> 2:54:33.420]  That no one even knows how much fake money there is so you've all heard about
[2:54:33.980 --> 2:54:39.100]  African countries where you had to have five trillion dollars to buy a loaf of bread or why my republic germany
[2:54:40.300 --> 2:54:45.660]  In the great depression where you had to have a wheelbarrow of deutsch marks millions of of deutsch marks
[2:54:45.660 --> 2:54:51.340]  Be able to have a meal and and you pay for your meal up front because by the time you finish the meal in two hours
[2:54:51.340 --> 2:54:53.340]  It would be twice as much
[2:54:53.500 --> 2:54:55.500]  They've artificially created this
[2:54:55.500 --> 2:55:00.460]  And now they needed an excuse to pop the bubble and then take over all the real land and real property
[2:55:01.100 --> 2:55:04.940]  And they also need to bankrupt all the real businesses to get people dependent on a universal
[2:55:05.740 --> 2:55:08.300]  Guaranteed income about $1,200 a month
[2:55:09.100 --> 2:55:14.300]  And with that comes all the strings and controls that are attached. They're now announcing if you don't take the vaccine
[2:55:14.300 --> 2:55:20.060]  You don't get it if you don't send your children to the leftist programming. You don't get it and that's just in 2021
[2:55:20.860 --> 2:55:24.940]  Solving it out. So this is total control. They have a name for it. It's called serfdom
[2:55:24.940 --> 2:55:26.940]  It's called slavery
[2:55:27.500 --> 2:55:30.860]  The globalist for over 100 years literally meet up on top
[2:55:31.580 --> 2:55:33.580]  mountains in switzerland other areas in europe
[2:55:34.060 --> 2:55:36.060]  And plot the takeover of society
[2:55:36.380 --> 2:55:39.980]  And much of this again has come out in senate reports as early as
[2:55:41.340 --> 2:55:43.340]  1977 in the church committee reports
[2:55:43.660 --> 2:55:46.540]  This is the shadow of government. These are the oligarchs and
[2:55:47.180 --> 2:55:53.580]  They want a corporate takeover of the very biological function of humans. You don't just think they want to control the biological
[2:55:53.580 --> 2:55:57.260]  life cycle of corn or of tomatoes
[2:55:57.740 --> 2:56:00.780]  Where corn and tomatoes can't produce any new corn or tomatoes
[2:56:00.780 --> 2:56:04.380]  You have to go back to the corporation and buy the seeds from them that only live once
[2:56:04.780 --> 2:56:08.780]  You don't just think they want to control the salmon that they've spliced with grasshoppers
[2:56:09.020 --> 2:56:12.060]  That are twice as big and eat and kill the normal natural salmon
[2:56:12.300 --> 2:56:13.580]  They want us
[2:56:13.580 --> 2:56:17.260]  And they want to control that and they want to be able to have clones and
[2:56:17.980 --> 2:56:22.780]  Basically stuff right out of Blade Runner. They want to be able to play god and they've been doing all this
[2:56:22.780 --> 2:56:26.380]  underground literally and figuratively for at least 50 years
[2:56:26.860 --> 2:56:28.860]  And now they're emerging
[2:56:28.940 --> 2:56:33.180]  With all of it out in the open and they want to be able to silence anybody that challenges them
[2:56:34.460 --> 2:56:39.100]  So here's the most important point I want to make to everybody. They're preparing a global financial collapse
[2:56:39.740 --> 2:56:44.460]  They're going to roll out new digital cryptocurrencies. China is launching theirs in two months
[2:56:45.180 --> 2:56:48.220]  The system has bet everything on big tech and the social media
[2:56:48.220 --> 2:56:53.580]  Those are going to be the new digital countries and it's going to be in those digital countries minded and controlled
[2:56:53.900 --> 2:56:57.580]  by literal communist trained organizations like the southern poverty loss center in adl
[2:56:58.060 --> 2:57:00.860]  That you'll be programmed to live in a new communist system
[2:57:01.180 --> 2:57:06.140]  Where the corporations are above you and operate a corporate fascist crony capitalist system
[2:57:06.620 --> 2:57:10.940]  And so I know this has become a very partisan issue. I didn't like george bush because he was pro-war
[2:57:11.260 --> 2:57:12.220]  I exposed him
[2:57:12.220 --> 2:57:17.900]  I didn't like bill clinton because he was evil or barack obama because he was a fraud and a lot of democrats liked me and listened to me
[2:57:18.620 --> 2:57:21.020]  Because they're like, hey, this guy you know makes a lot of sense
[2:57:21.420 --> 2:57:24.060]  Trump came along and I saw him as a chance to beat the globalist
[2:57:24.300 --> 2:57:28.140]  He had a lot of problems and it became partisan again, but trump's gone
[2:57:28.540 --> 2:57:33.260]  Okay, and so that's a negative thing in some ways as you're now seeing it's accelerating the globalist plan
[2:57:33.820 --> 2:57:37.180]  But at another level it's time for people to come together and realize that serious this is
[2:57:37.180 --> 2:57:42.860]  It doesn't matter what's Mitch McConnell's or Chuck Schumer. These are all very very bad very very empty people put
[2:57:43.340 --> 2:57:47.820]  Hey, Alex. How you doing, man? Is this the guy that called in about living defense?
[2:57:48.540 --> 2:57:55.580]  Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I've been trying to get a hold of you since monday when I heard you got that fresh shipment of living defense
[2:57:55.660 --> 2:57:57.180]  In from utah
[2:57:57.180 --> 2:58:00.540]  I said man, I got to get on that show and give him an update
[2:58:00.860 --> 2:58:04.060]  I said if I ever get a chance to be on our show
[2:58:04.060 --> 2:58:09.580]  So I'm gonna tell the world about living defense and what it did for me personally. Now look
[2:58:09.900 --> 2:58:15.260]  I'm 64 years old going on 20 thanks to this info for store products
[2:58:15.340 --> 2:58:20.700]  And by the way, I bought 800 dollars worth the other night. So I'm doing what I can brother
[2:58:21.260 --> 2:58:25.100]  What my my contention is why don't we start this new year off right?
[2:58:25.580 --> 2:58:31.580]  With everybody getting a couple bottles of living defense now. You got to follow that up with the microsdx
[2:58:31.580 --> 2:58:37.180]  I learned that so it's like god working is so amazing. We didn't know we didn't screen your call
[2:58:37.180 --> 2:58:43.020]  We had no idea and I go to you a year later and you're here telling people about living defense living defense living defense
[2:58:44.540 --> 2:58:50.380]  The globalists are taking control of the entire human genome. They are forcing mutations
[2:58:50.940 --> 2:58:54.060]  This is forced evolution or de-evolution
[2:58:54.540 --> 2:58:57.740]  When you look at all the major research all the major programs are carrying out
[2:58:57.740 --> 2:59:02.700]  They are not to produce people that are smarter or folks that live longer or more oral
[2:59:03.180 --> 2:59:08.860]  No, it's turning humanity into a commodity. Now, we see some propaganda like communist china bragging
[2:59:09.260 --> 2:59:15.260]  Hey, we've done mRNA vaccines to make our soldiers superman. That's the way to make it sexy that hey
[2:59:15.740 --> 2:59:17.740]  We're experimenting on our troops
[2:59:17.820 --> 2:59:23.900]  We'll say things with that into our troops and thousands and thousands of die each time they try a new experimental vaccine
[2:59:23.900 --> 2:59:28.540]  And I'm talking to high-level folks inside the federal government and the state of Texas self department
[2:59:28.700 --> 2:59:31.900]  They say Alex we know it hurts a lot of people but for a greater good
[2:59:32.300 --> 2:59:37.420]  But that's not even true and it violates the Geneva convention the nuremberg code federal state law
[2:59:37.900 --> 2:59:43.500]  This is violence being carried out against us by that as a charity and we have a right to resist it with any means necessary
[2:59:43.500 --> 2:59:50.860]  You're listening to the alex jones show
[3:00:04.940 --> 3:00:07.580]  It's time for people to come together realize that serious this is
[3:00:07.980 --> 3:00:11.820]  It doesn't matter. It's mitch mcconnell's or chuck schumer. These are all very very bad
[3:00:11.820 --> 3:00:15.420]  Very very empty people put in power by the structure because they're puppets
[3:00:15.900 --> 3:00:18.940]  And they're preparing a global collapse. They're accelerating a global collapse
[3:00:19.260 --> 3:00:24.940]  And you need to know that if you go along with this and you go along with wearing the mask and taking the inoculations and all this
[3:00:25.980 --> 3:00:28.300]  You're not having power over the system by joining it
[3:00:28.460 --> 3:00:34.540]  You are becoming a cog in the system and a slave and you are greasing the skids for all of our destruction because this is all about
[3:00:35.260 --> 3:00:37.100]  Depopulation at the end of the day
[3:00:37.100 --> 3:00:43.020]  So please if you're a new viewer or new listener check out this information. Look into the devils group. Look into the club of rom
[3:00:43.740 --> 3:00:46.460]  Look into set part memorandum seven two seven seven
[3:00:48.300 --> 3:00:51.420]  Look into state department random 200 from kissinger
[3:00:52.300 --> 3:00:59.420]  Look into the globalist depopulation plan. They call it the good club billionaires club for global government and depopulation
[3:01:00.380 --> 3:01:04.060]  Look into the people that that want you to take the inoculations and want to force all this on you
[3:01:04.060 --> 3:01:07.340]  Who they are and how they admit that through these mRNA vaccines
[3:01:07.340 --> 3:01:14.220]  They want to attack the placenta and women so they can't have children. Look into operation lockstep. Look into operation event 201
[3:01:15.580 --> 3:01:22.940]  Look into Fauci funding six years ago. The coronavirus research at wuhan. That's on record. Hell was big news then it was very controversial
[3:01:23.420 --> 3:01:27.900]  But u.s. Say there goes. Oh, it's a conspiracy theory. New york times. Don't let them lie to you
[3:01:28.460 --> 3:01:32.300]  Don't let them cut you off from the truth because if they were so powerful if they were invincible
[3:01:32.300 --> 3:01:34.300]  They wouldn't want all of us shut down right now
[3:01:34.780 --> 3:01:36.780]  The truth is we have a real shot
[3:01:37.020 --> 3:01:42.460]  They're turning this around and changing all this but you've got to do the core research and then say i'm a human being
[3:01:42.860 --> 3:01:46.700]  I have value. I have rights and I declare them and I do not accept
[3:01:47.420 --> 3:01:49.260]  this new world takeover
[3:01:49.260 --> 3:01:51.260]  Because again, this is a design collapse
[3:01:51.740 --> 3:01:56.540]  They create quadrillions upon quadrillions of fake money. They buy up the world
[3:01:57.340 --> 3:01:59.340]  But then there's so much debt that causes inflation
[3:01:59.340 --> 3:02:02.140]  So they start hyper-inflating and that's why
[3:02:03.100 --> 3:02:06.860]  Used to republicans didn't want to have big devils as a new to the democrats at least they claim
[3:02:06.860 --> 3:02:10.220]  But now joe biden doesn't care just like trump doesn't care because it's too late
[3:02:11.340 --> 3:02:13.340]  They're going into the hyper inflation mode
[3:02:13.900 --> 3:02:17.260]  And the average person's not going to be able to afford anything but a coffin size apartment
[3:02:17.740 --> 3:02:21.100]  And you're only going to be able to use the credits on your universal credit score
[3:02:21.820 --> 3:02:25.660]  To get a 250 square foot coffin apartment. This is all official
[3:02:25.660 --> 3:02:30.300]  That's what they've been making it cool and saying it's trendy. All of this is training you
[3:02:30.940 --> 3:02:37.180]  To accept less and to have no freedoms and they're going to merge the western world with the third world into one giant slum
[3:02:37.980 --> 3:02:40.140]  But the third world will be corralled into these
[3:02:40.780 --> 3:02:46.380]  View-in corridors in the western world where there's authorized human activity everywhere else will be unauthorized
[3:02:46.540 --> 3:02:48.540]  We'll show you some u.n maps
[3:02:48.620 --> 3:02:50.060]  and from the
[3:02:50.060 --> 3:02:51.500]  90s by the way
[3:02:51.500 --> 3:02:53.740]  But the doctor up michael coffin put together with their own documents
[3:02:54.460 --> 3:02:55.580]  and so
[3:02:55.580 --> 3:03:01.340]  Again, this is a dystopia all the other areas all of their farmland and rural areas will be off limits
[3:03:02.220 --> 3:03:04.860]  And the cars won't even start because they're all going to be
[3:03:05.340 --> 3:03:10.140]  Self-driving and you won't be able you won't be able to even get into those areas via the global social credit score
[3:03:10.940 --> 3:03:17.500]  Where in apple and google and china's own words if you haven't submitted to them you won't be able to take one half step outside your front door
[3:03:18.220 --> 3:03:19.820]  So if you think they're just taking
[3:03:19.820 --> 3:03:21.820]  Trump's bank accounts away
[3:03:22.220 --> 3:03:24.060]  Or my bank accounts away
[3:03:24.060 --> 3:03:27.820]  Think again. This is coming for everyone in a big big way
[3:03:28.460 --> 3:03:32.220]  People are now figuring out that I didn't say this stuff over the years to just scare you
[3:03:33.100 --> 3:03:35.100]  I didn't just make this stuff up
[3:03:35.260 --> 3:03:37.260]  Harry shearer once at a documentary
[3:03:37.980 --> 3:03:39.980]  Talked about listening to me and he said
[3:03:40.060 --> 3:03:42.060]  You know i'll sit there listening to it with my family
[3:03:42.700 --> 3:03:46.300]  On a shortwave radio while we're out camping and you know this guy could be
[3:03:47.100 --> 3:03:49.180]  You know the most incredible fiction writer ever
[3:03:49.180 --> 3:03:53.180]  Because the stuff he makes up is just fantastical and so scary
[3:03:53.900 --> 3:03:57.500]  We'll see sure I didn't make it up dude. I'm not that smart or that cool
[3:03:58.140 --> 3:04:00.140]  But when I do read top rich people
[3:04:00.540 --> 3:04:04.140]  Saying they're going to do this and then I watch them carry out each piece of it
[3:04:04.460 --> 3:04:06.460]  I am smart enough to do something about it, buddy
[3:04:06.940 --> 3:04:07.900]  So
[3:04:07.900 --> 3:04:09.900]  I'm not this master science fiction writer
[3:04:10.940 --> 3:04:14.220]  I'm not i'm just a father and an american and somebody that cares about humanity
[3:04:14.620 --> 3:04:16.620]  And this stuff's real okay
[3:04:16.620 --> 3:04:21.980]  So I don't care if you're black white old young a muslim a jew a christian an agnostic an atheist whatever the hell you are
[3:04:22.380 --> 3:04:24.700]  You're a human you better start valuing yourself because
[3:04:25.420 --> 3:04:30.940]  This world government is a hundred percent real and it's a hundred percent authoritarian and it's a hundred percent anti-human
[3:04:31.900 --> 3:04:34.780]  And of course if you think joe biden and marshal law
[3:04:35.900 --> 3:04:39.580]  Is the issue you're wrong. This is way bigger than joe biden. He's a husk a puppet
[3:04:39.820 --> 3:04:43.980]  But the people behind him the pull of the strings are very very ruthless and they want you for
[3:04:43.980 --> 3:04:45.980]  And is there control these are monsters?
[3:04:46.460 --> 3:04:48.460]  Look at the claus wall look into bill case
[3:04:49.100 --> 3:04:51.100]  Look into junk claude yunker
[3:04:52.860 --> 3:05:01.500]  The resistance dot video the resistance dot video the resistance dot video the resistance dot video
[3:05:02.060 --> 3:05:06.060]  The resistance dot video the resistance dot video
[3:05:07.100 --> 3:05:09.100]  info wars dot com
[3:05:09.100 --> 3:05:11.100]  news wars dot com
[3:05:11.100 --> 3:05:12.540]  band dot video
[3:05:12.540 --> 3:05:15.500]  And hundreds of other URLs we've launched have been banned
[3:05:16.060 --> 3:05:21.100]  That's why every month we launch a new URL before they ban it
[3:05:21.740 --> 3:05:25.340]  But sorrows and bill gates and the gloves are on our tail
[3:05:25.980 --> 3:05:32.140]  But the new website is the resistance dot video the resistance dot video
[3:05:32.540 --> 3:05:36.620]  They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them
[3:05:36.620 --> 3:05:43.500]  So the new URL that links right to band dot video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports
[3:05:43.740 --> 3:05:51.500]  And all the suppressed information is that the resistance dot video share the link the resistance dot video the resistance dot video
[3:05:55.340 --> 3:06:01.180]  News analysis reports, it's the alex joneshows
[3:06:01.180 --> 3:06:06.460]  Sweet dreams are made of the air the acquired not unfortunate he owns luxembourg
[3:06:08.060 --> 3:06:09.580]  German royalty
[3:06:09.580 --> 3:06:15.260]  Look into prince charles running the whole operation his father's saying he wants to be a virus to kill 80 percent of us
[3:06:16.060 --> 3:06:17.500]  prince philip
[3:06:17.500 --> 3:06:18.940]  And then realize
[3:06:18.940 --> 3:06:20.700]  But it's a matter of euro
[3:06:20.700 --> 3:06:23.900]  Somebody that works at the southern parvy law center or whether you're somebody that works at
[3:06:24.700 --> 3:06:26.860]  The adl or whether you're somebody that works at media matters
[3:06:26.860 --> 3:06:31.420]  I can get here on an animal level and hate you and get mad at you
[3:06:32.460 --> 3:06:36.300]  But I realize you're taking a paycheck. Okay, so I'm gonna say this. I actually care about you
[3:06:37.020 --> 3:06:42.940]  Because if we're gonna turn this around I need to reach out to people like you and get you to understand that you're destroying yourself
[3:06:43.260 --> 3:06:47.740]  I know they're just gonna find somebody else to take your job if you grow a conscience and do the right thing
[3:06:48.380 --> 3:06:52.940]  I'm just speaking to you because your soul matters and I'm talking to right wingers and I'm talking to left wingers
[3:06:52.940 --> 3:06:58.140]  I'm talking to idiots in the kkk and you know and real white supremacist. There are some of them out there
[3:06:58.620 --> 3:07:00.700]  Do you understand this is an attack on humans period?
[3:07:01.100 --> 3:07:04.460]  Do you understand the so-called left you think you're fighting towards sorrows of these people?
[3:07:05.500 --> 3:07:12.140]  Are absolutely ruthless eugenicists that hate everybody and think that we all deserve to basically die under social diremodistic systems
[3:07:12.620 --> 3:07:15.420]  So I don't care which one of these organizations or groups you're in
[3:07:16.140 --> 3:07:18.140]  We're all being targeted. This is stupid
[3:07:18.140 --> 3:07:23.740]  This is stupid. This is wrong. Are some areas of Africa overpopulated Latin America? Damn right
[3:07:24.220 --> 3:07:27.980]  Are they not getting enough nutrition so they grow up with with low IQs? Yeah, it's sad
[3:07:28.060 --> 3:07:32.380]  I want to build them up industrialize them then their population will stabilize all the studies show
[3:07:32.940 --> 3:07:36.700]  Instead of you read deeper into the globalist models. They balloon the third world population
[3:07:37.420 --> 3:07:41.420]  To use that as a political weapon to actually take over the planet. This is so cold-blooded
[3:07:41.980 --> 3:07:46.140]  So everything you hear the globalist saying they're doing for one reason is really for another. All right
[3:07:46.140 --> 3:07:50.300]  Owen shroyer is sitting in this week for me, but I'll be popping with live reports as well
[3:07:50.620 --> 3:07:52.620]  Had to take some time off with the family
[3:07:52.700 --> 3:07:55.180]  But these are just incredible times and I'm so glad that tulsi
[3:07:55.740 --> 3:07:59.340]  Gabbards and that so many others are coming out and pointing out the elephant in the room that yes
[3:07:59.420 --> 3:08:02.860]  It's martial law, but it's medical martial law. It's cultural martial law
[3:08:02.940 --> 3:08:09.500]  It's big tech AI martial law and it's all about oppressing and dominating and getting past these barriers
[3:08:09.580 --> 3:08:15.660]  That that that our ancestors fought for thousands of years to develop of our own space and our own property and our own bodies
[3:08:15.660 --> 3:08:17.980]  And our own genetics and our own choices
[3:08:18.700 --> 3:08:20.700]  This is an authoritarian
[3:08:20.780 --> 3:08:24.460]  Revolution taking over the planet. It is the great reset. It is the great takeover
[3:08:24.860 --> 3:08:28.140]  It is the cover for the global collapse to consolidate their control
[3:08:29.260 --> 3:08:32.700]  And move to the final phase of their takeover where they believe they're going to merge the machines and become gods
[3:08:33.100 --> 3:08:37.580]  I don't know that's going to come true for these megalomaniacs. I just know they've been following their plan and so far
[3:08:37.580 --> 3:08:43.180]  They've been succeeding and they believe that if you don't stand up and say no to them that you deserve what happens to you
[3:08:43.180 --> 3:08:45.740]  Think about that. Do you deserve what happens to you?
[3:08:46.540 --> 3:08:48.540]  Do you really just want to sign over your will?
[3:08:49.100 --> 3:08:51.100]  and and believe you're on the winning team and
[3:08:51.420 --> 3:08:56.940]  Get a universal income and do whatever they say. Do you really think that's good to be like a cow or a pig or a duck?
[3:08:57.020 --> 3:09:01.740]  That's in a pen that is ignorant to the day it slaughters and does it control so destiny
[3:09:01.820 --> 3:09:05.260]  You're a human being you have free will we have incredible potential together
[3:09:05.740 --> 3:09:10.060]  But you've got to decide that you have that potential and you've got to declare that potential
[3:09:10.060 --> 3:09:15.020]  And you've got to stand for that potential. We're all going to make mistakes under what's a perfect and for my mistakes. I apologize
[3:09:15.820 --> 3:09:21.420]  For the things I haven't done. I apologize for the fact that I've been so threatened by this knowing all this news for decades and trying to warn people
[3:09:21.660 --> 3:09:27.180]  I've been obnoxious in the process but doesn't matter. I've been the man in the arena and at least we've raised the alarm and done a lot of good
[3:09:27.580 --> 3:09:31.900]  And in closing I want to salute our listeners and supporters and the crew and everybody that makes this happen
[3:09:32.540 --> 3:09:34.540]  Without you, we wouldn't be on air right now
[3:09:34.700 --> 3:09:37.740]  Without you, we couldn't have warned people how they're planning false facts in the 20th
[3:09:37.740 --> 3:09:40.380]  And had americans stand down and not walk into that trap
[3:09:41.020 --> 3:09:43.500]  And without you keeping us on air god knows where we'd be now
[3:09:43.500 --> 3:09:48.380]  So it's a very great honor and a privilege to be on air and i'm your humble servant
[3:09:48.380 --> 3:09:51.340]  And I thank you for the bottom of my heart god bless and good luck
[3:09:58.940 --> 3:10:00.940]  Great being on with alex shone show
[3:10:00.940 --> 3:10:06.700]  Saw it through and uh boy everything alex said it is so true
[3:10:08.140 --> 3:10:12.140]  This is the ussa united soviet states of america
[3:10:13.100 --> 3:10:15.100]  He's been warning about it and so have we
[3:10:16.460 --> 3:10:20.620]  The reality is hitting us in front of our eyes who could have believed this would happen
[3:10:21.980 --> 3:10:23.980]  That we would lose our freedom
[3:10:25.500 --> 3:10:27.500]  Our peace and justice
[3:10:27.500 --> 3:10:31.260]  Are being stolen from us right in front of our eyes
[3:10:32.380 --> 3:10:34.940]  And look at the freaks that are robbing it from us

[3:11:38.540 --> 3:11:41.020]  That's not only in america it's around the world

[3:12:00.220 --> 3:12:03.020]  When people weren't talking about this stuff
[3:12:04.380 --> 3:12:07.900]  An honorary doctor from the national university of health sciences
[3:12:07.900 --> 3:12:10.860]  And they make a big deal of their picking somebody transgender
[3:12:11.420 --> 3:12:16.220]  I could care what you cut off what you didn't I just want the best person in there

[3:12:40.940 --> 3:12:43.740]  Yeah, you remember the obama administration
[3:12:44.780 --> 3:12:46.780]  Remember the patriot
[3:12:47.340 --> 3:12:49.340]  That he doubled up on
[3:12:50.460 --> 3:12:54.940]  That they could kill us any place anywhere anytime for any reason
[3:12:55.980 --> 3:12:58.940]  We had a judge joria trial america

[3:13:12.860 --> 3:13:14.860]  Liberals respect freedom
[3:13:14.860 --> 3:13:18.860]  Liberals respect individuality you look up the definition of the word
[3:13:20.380 --> 3:13:22.380]  Liberal
[3:13:22.380 --> 3:13:27.500]  willing to respect or accept behavior or opinions different from one's own
[3:13:27.500 --> 3:13:29.500]  Open to new ideas
[3:13:29.500 --> 3:13:33.500]  These aren't liberals
[3:13:33.500 --> 3:13:35.500]  They're murderers
[3:13:35.500 --> 3:13:39.500]  Not a war that biden didn't love
[3:13:39.500 --> 3:13:41.500]  Didn't vote for
[3:13:41.500 --> 3:13:45.500]  Sending all our jobs over nafta that he loved
[3:13:47.500 --> 3:13:51.500]  Bringing shine into the world or trade organization
[3:13:55.500 --> 3:13:57.500]  Oh what happened

[3:14:03.500 --> 3:14:05.500]  Secretary of state
[3:14:05.500 --> 3:14:13.500]  How come the biden thing at pennsylvania university got some 22 million dollars
[3:14:13.500 --> 3:14:15.500]  And most of it from the chinese
[3:14:17.500 --> 3:14:19.500]  And he wouldn't answer it
[3:14:19.500 --> 3:14:21.500]  Why do I have to answer it

[3:14:29.500 --> 3:14:31.500]  Are just
[3:14:31.500 --> 3:14:35.500]  Workers on the global plantation of slave landia
[3:14:37.500 --> 3:14:39.500]  Liberals
[3:14:39.500 --> 3:14:41.500]  They're libtards
[3:14:41.500 --> 3:14:43.500]  They're retarded freaks
[3:14:43.500 --> 3:14:45.500]  That are power hungry
[3:14:47.500 --> 3:14:49.500]  That have robbed us of our freedom
[3:14:49.500 --> 3:14:51.500]  Of our peace and our justice
[3:14:51.500 --> 3:14:53.500]  Look at this
[3:14:53.500 --> 3:14:55.500]  Look at the clown show

[3:15:13.500 --> 3:15:15.500]  The defense secretary first one
[3:15:17.500 --> 3:15:19.500]  Yeah
[3:15:19.500 --> 3:15:21.500]  We had a black president
[3:15:21.500 --> 3:15:23.500]  And this guy was a general in iraq
[3:15:25.500 --> 3:15:27.500]  Responsible to the slaughter of a lot of people
[3:15:27.500 --> 3:15:29.500]  But best of all
[3:15:29.500 --> 3:15:31.500]  On the board of directors of raytheon
[3:15:33.500 --> 3:15:35.500]  Yeah
[3:15:35.500 --> 3:15:37.500]  The big defense contract
[3:15:39.500 --> 3:15:41.500]  They're taking over
[3:15:41.500 --> 3:15:43.500]  Unless we fight back
[3:15:43.500 --> 3:15:45.500]  Fight back within four wars
[3:15:45.500 --> 3:15:47.500]  We'll be a pod
[3:15:47.500 --> 3:16:16.500]  We'll be a pod we'll be right back.
[3:16:17.500 --> 3:16:19.500]  Hey everybody
[3:16:19.500 --> 3:16:21.500]  Confused about staying healthy
[3:16:21.500 --> 3:16:23.500]  In a crazy covid culture
[3:16:23.500 --> 3:16:25.500]  Me too
[3:16:25.500 --> 3:16:27.500]  But listen
[3:16:27.500 --> 3:16:29.500]  After all the research
[3:16:29.500 --> 3:16:31.500]  After all the squabbling
[3:16:31.500 --> 3:16:33.500]  There's one thing almost everyone agrees on
[3:16:33.500 --> 3:16:35.500]  It's that immune system health
[3:16:35.500 --> 3:16:37.500]  Can literally be the difference between life and death
[3:16:37.500 --> 3:16:39.500]  You probably already believe that
[3:16:39.500 --> 3:16:41.500]  I certainly do
[3:16:41.500 --> 3:16:43.500]  So here's the thing
[3:16:43.500 --> 3:16:45.500]  I wanted to get past the craziness
[3:16:45.500 --> 3:16:47.500]  That the substances actually have studies
[3:16:47.500 --> 3:16:49.500]  That demonstrate some efficacy
[3:16:49.500 --> 3:16:51.500]  In immune support
[3:16:51.500 --> 3:16:53.500]  Now you'll have to sign a waiver

[3:18:53.500 --> 3:18:55.500]  Secure your own safe source
[3:18:55.500 --> 3:18:57.500]  Of food supply sale
[3:18:57.500 --> 3:18:59.500]  It's the new prices in 2021
[3:18:59.500 --> 3:19:01.500]  But it's the lowest price for high quality food
[3:19:01.500 --> 3:19:03.500]  You're gonna find at infowarstore.com
[3:19:03.500 --> 3:19:05.500]  The subsection is prepared with alex.com
[3:19:05.500 --> 3:19:07.500]  And it's all these globalists do this
[3:19:07.500 --> 3:19:09.500]  And as they hoard the food
[3:19:09.500 --> 3:19:11.500]  And as they prepare
[3:19:11.500 --> 3:19:13.500]  You need to understand that you need 25 year
[3:19:13.500 --> 3:19:15.500]  Food supply in the last 25 years
[3:19:15.500 --> 3:19:17.500]  One month, three months, six months
[3:19:17.500 --> 3:19:19.500]  And it's the highest quality you're gonna find
[3:19:19.500 --> 3:19:21.500]  And it's just good to have that check box
[3:19:21.500 --> 3:19:23.500]  Taken care of and you know you're getting good food
[3:19:23.500 --> 3:19:25.500]  At a very good price and you know
[3:19:25.500 --> 3:19:27.500]  That a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this
[3:19:27.500 --> 3:19:29.500]  Goes to us to fund our operation
[3:19:29.500 --> 3:19:31.500]  So prepare with alex.com
[3:19:31.500 --> 3:19:33.500]  Or infowarstore.com

[3:19:37.500 --> 3:19:39.500]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in
[3:19:39.500 --> 3:19:41.500]  All the forced GMO and more
[3:19:41.500 --> 3:19:43.500]  It's time to start getting prepared
[3:19:43.500 --> 3:19:45.500]  It starts with self defense
[3:19:45.500 --> 3:19:47.500]  So it starts with digging in
[3:19:47.500 --> 3:19:49.500]  With a long, globalist fight
[3:19:49.500 --> 3:20:17.500]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show
[3:20:17.500 --> 3:20:19.500]  4 is 1776
[3:20:19.500 --> 3:20:21.500]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show
[3:20:21.500 --> 3:20:23.500]  With Gerald Salente
[3:20:23.500 --> 3:20:25.500]  Great day knockout
[3:20:25.500 --> 3:20:27.500]  On the stove
[3:20:27.500 --> 3:20:29.500]  And I want to thank
[3:20:29.500 --> 3:20:31.500]  Alex for having me on
[3:20:31.500 --> 3:20:33.500]  And all the staff
[3:20:33.500 --> 3:20:35.500]  And the great work that they do
[3:20:35.500 --> 3:20:37.500]  And these are critical times
[3:20:37.500 --> 3:20:39.500]  This is like nothing we've ever seen
[3:20:39.500 --> 3:20:41.500]  In our lifetime
[3:20:41.500 --> 3:20:43.500]  Our freedoms are being robbed
[3:20:43.500 --> 3:20:45.500]  In front of our eyes
[3:20:45.500 --> 3:20:47.500]  How they over blew what happened
[3:20:47.500 --> 3:20:49.500]  On January 6th
[3:20:49.500 --> 3:20:51.500]  The epiphany, you know
[3:20:51.500 --> 3:20:53.500]  Yeah
[3:20:53.500 --> 3:20:55.500]  And now it wasn't
[3:20:55.500 --> 3:20:57.500]  Again, you see the pictures
[3:20:57.500 --> 3:20:59.500]  A guy screaming at the cops
[3:20:59.500 --> 3:21:01.500]  Well dressed up in a military
[3:21:01.500 --> 3:21:03.500]  Drag
[3:21:03.500 --> 3:21:05.500]  They could blow apart
[3:21:05.500 --> 3:21:07.500]  A thousand people
[3:21:07.500 --> 3:21:09.500]  Why aren't you guys doing anything
[3:21:09.500 --> 3:21:11.500]  To stop this? What's going on?
[3:21:11.500 --> 3:21:13.500]  How can you not do anything?
[3:21:13.500 --> 3:21:15.500]  And they just stood there
[3:21:15.500 --> 3:21:17.500]  You saw the pictures of the cops
[3:21:17.500 --> 3:21:19.500]  Opening up doors and letting people
[3:21:19.500 --> 3:21:21.500]  Come in
[3:21:21.500 --> 3:21:23.500]  You've seen the videos
[3:21:25.500 --> 3:21:27.500]  A guy smashing a window
[3:21:27.500 --> 3:21:29.500]  And the cops just standing there
[3:21:29.500 --> 3:21:31.500]  This is a real deadly riot
[3:21:31.500 --> 3:21:33.500]  As they're pushing it up
[3:21:33.500 --> 3:21:35.500]  To be so now they could give us
[3:21:35.500 --> 3:21:37.500]  Domestic terrorism
[3:21:37.500 --> 3:21:39.500]  To be so now they could give us
[3:21:39.500 --> 3:21:41.500]  Domestic terrorism
[3:21:41.500 --> 3:21:43.500]  You guys would have been in there
[3:21:43.500 --> 3:21:45.500]  With guns blowing everybody
[3:21:45.500 --> 3:21:47.500]  Apart
[3:21:47.500 --> 3:21:49.500]  Yeah
[3:21:49.500 --> 3:21:51.500]  That would have been the riot
[3:21:51.500 --> 3:21:53.500]  That's what we would have seen
[3:21:55.500 --> 3:21:57.500]  But now
[3:21:57.500 --> 3:21:59.500]  This is what we saw
[3:21:59.500 --> 3:22:01.500]  Look at this
[3:22:01.500 --> 3:22:03.500]  You can't stop this?
[3:22:03.500 --> 3:22:05.500]  What are you kidding me?
[3:22:05.500 --> 3:22:07.500]  Where are the cops?
[3:22:07.500 --> 3:22:09.500]  What's going on?
[3:22:09.500 --> 3:22:11.500]  You got a couple of losers there?
[3:22:11.500 --> 3:22:13.500]  If this is a real riot
[3:22:13.500 --> 3:22:15.500]  They would have gone in there
[3:22:15.500 --> 3:22:17.500]  With black
[3:22:17.500 --> 3:22:19.500]  And you wouldn't see their faces
[3:22:19.500 --> 3:22:21.500]  And they'd be shooting the hell out of everybody
[3:22:23.500 --> 3:22:25.500]  For this
[3:22:25.500 --> 3:22:27.500]  For this we lose our rights
[3:22:27.500 --> 3:22:29.500]  For this freak show
[3:22:29.500 --> 3:22:31.500]  Robbed
[3:22:31.500 --> 3:22:33.500]  Right in front of our eyes
[3:22:33.500 --> 3:22:35.500]  But hey
[3:22:35.500 --> 3:22:37.500]  There he goes
[3:22:37.500 --> 3:22:39.500]  There's that cop that killed that woman
[3:22:39.500 --> 3:22:41.500]  What a tough guy he is
[3:22:41.500 --> 3:22:43.500]  Huh?
[3:22:43.500 --> 3:22:45.500]  Wow
[3:22:45.500 --> 3:22:47.500]  Look at all the cops over there
[3:22:47.500 --> 3:22:49.500]  Look at all the ones behind her over there
[3:22:49.500 --> 3:22:51.500]  How come they weren't doing anything?
[3:22:51.500 --> 3:22:53.500]  Look at that
[3:22:53.500 --> 3:22:55.500]  Look at that tough little boy
[3:22:55.500 --> 3:22:57.500]  Look how tough that little boy is now
[3:22:57.500 --> 3:22:59.500]  You slimy low lives
[3:22:59.500 --> 3:23:01.500]  You should all run
[3:23:01.500 --> 3:23:03.500]  Hell
[3:23:03.500 --> 3:23:05.500]  You should run for what they did to that poor woman
[3:23:05.500 --> 3:23:07.500]  Look at them
[3:23:07.500 --> 3:23:09.500]  Look at them
[3:23:09.500 --> 3:23:11.500]  Little tough boys
[3:23:11.500 --> 3:23:13.500]  You're all tough when you got your guns
[3:23:13.500 --> 3:23:15.500]  And your buddies behind you
[3:23:15.500 --> 3:23:17.500]  But you have a pair of cojones
[3:23:17.500 --> 3:23:19.500]  Smaller than a mothball
[3:23:19.500 --> 3:23:21.500]  When you're a man to man
[3:23:23.500 --> 3:23:25.500]  For that
[3:23:25.500 --> 3:23:27.500]  Our lives are being destroyed
[3:23:29.500 --> 3:23:31.500]  Domestic terrorism

[3:23:41.500 --> 3:23:43.500]  They are the terrorists
[3:23:43.500 --> 3:23:45.500]  That take us to war
[3:23:45.500 --> 3:23:47.500]  Like the slimy murderers
[3:23:47.500 --> 3:23:49.500]  George W. Bush
[3:23:49.500 --> 3:23:51.500]  Calm down, Celente
[3:23:51.500 --> 3:23:53.500]  He's only another daddy's boy
[3:23:53.500 --> 3:23:55.500]  Like little Andy Cuomo
[3:23:55.500 --> 3:23:57.500]  Born on 3rd Basin
[3:23:57.500 --> 3:23:59.500]  Thought he had a home run
[3:23:59.500 --> 3:24:01.500]  An arrogant little nothing of a clownster
[3:24:01.500 --> 3:24:03.500]  Who'd be nobody
[3:24:03.500 --> 3:24:05.500]  If daddy wasn't
[3:24:05.500 --> 3:24:07.500]  Georgie
[3:24:07.500 --> 3:24:09.500]  And grandpa wasn't that other guy
[3:24:09.500 --> 3:24:11.500]  Yeah

[3:24:19.500 --> 3:24:21.500]  People that believed his lies
[3:24:23.500 --> 3:24:25.500]  And slaughtering over a million
[3:24:25.500 --> 3:24:29.500]  Innocent Iraqis
[3:24:29.500 --> 3:24:31.500]  Prescott Bush
[3:24:31.500 --> 3:24:33.500]  Was their grandpa
[3:24:33.500 --> 3:24:35.500]  Yeah
[3:24:35.500 --> 3:24:37.500]  Another murderer

[3:24:41.500 --> 3:24:43.500]  Yeah, Hile Prescott
[3:24:49.500 --> 3:24:51.500]  These are the people

[3:25:09.500 --> 3:25:11.500]  Paid for
[3:25:11.500 --> 3:25:13.500]  By we the people
[3:25:13.500 --> 3:25:15.500]  Domestic terrorism
[3:25:15.500 --> 3:25:17.500]  You bet
[3:25:17.500 --> 3:25:19.500]  You bet
[3:25:19.500 --> 3:25:21.500]  Domestic terrorism
[3:25:21.500 --> 3:25:23.500]  Right from the top of the White House
[3:25:23.500 --> 3:25:25.500]  From the Nobel
[3:25:25.500 --> 3:25:27.500]  Piece of crap prize winner
[3:25:27.500 --> 3:25:29.500]  Barack Obama
[3:25:29.500 --> 3:25:31.500]  Right on through
[3:25:31.500 --> 3:25:33.500]  There wasn't a war
[3:25:33.500 --> 3:25:35.500]  That Biden didn't love
[3:25:35.500 --> 3:25:37.500]  Those are the terrorists
[3:25:37.500 --> 3:25:39.500]  That robbed us of our rights
[3:25:39.500 --> 3:25:41.500]  The Patriot Act
[3:25:41.500 --> 3:25:43.500]  Hey, how come you're not fighting
[3:25:43.500 --> 3:25:45.500]  All them terrorists over there
[3:25:45.500 --> 3:25:47.500]  I thought the Patriot Act wasn't against
[3:25:47.500 --> 3:25:49.500]  Didn't stop Al Qaeda
[3:25:49.500 --> 3:25:51.500]  Who's an act against
[3:25:51.500 --> 3:25:53.500]  We the people
[3:25:53.500 --> 3:25:55.500]  Doubled up by
[3:25:55.500 --> 3:25:57.500]  Obama
[3:25:57.500 --> 3:25:59.500]  And now being put in full force
[3:25:59.500 --> 3:26:01.500]  By Biden
[3:26:03.500 --> 3:26:05.500]  Liberals
[3:26:05.500 --> 3:26:07.500]  Lib tards who believe him

[3:26:11.500 --> 3:26:13.500]  Quote, I'm really good at killing people
[3:26:13.500 --> 3:26:15.500]  As he's quoted in the book, Double Down
[3:26:15.500 --> 3:26:17.500]  Selenity
[3:26:17.500 --> 3:26:19.500]  You should be calm
[3:26:19.500 --> 3:26:21.500]  You should speak like the English
[3:26:21.500 --> 3:26:23.500]  They're so proper
[3:26:23.500 --> 3:26:25.500]  The Sun never set on the British
[3:26:25.500 --> 3:26:27.500]  Empire
[3:26:27.500 --> 3:26:29.500]  They've only conquered lands
[3:26:29.500 --> 3:26:31.500]  Slaughtered millions
[3:26:31.500 --> 3:26:33.500]  And millions of people
[3:26:33.500 --> 3:26:35.500]  But did it properly
[3:26:35.500 --> 3:26:37.500]  And then occupied
[3:26:37.500 --> 3:26:39.500]  Them like they did such a wonderful job
[3:26:39.500 --> 3:26:41.500]  In India destroying it
[3:26:41.500 --> 3:26:43.500]  So you should calm down
[3:26:43.500 --> 3:26:45.500]  And be like us
[3:26:45.500 --> 3:26:47.500]  Be little
[3:26:47.500 --> 3:26:49.500]  Gutless characters
[3:26:49.500 --> 3:26:51.500]  That America's become
[3:26:51.500 --> 3:26:53.500]  Accept the people tuning into
[3:26:53.500 --> 3:26:55.500]  Info Wars
[3:26:55.500 --> 3:26:57.500]  You're here because
[3:26:57.500 --> 3:26:59.500]  You want the truth
[3:26:59.500 --> 3:27:01.500]  You're here because you want action
[3:27:01.500 --> 3:27:03.500]  And it has to be peaceful
[3:27:03.500 --> 3:27:05.500]  It must be in peace
[3:27:05.500 --> 3:27:07.500]  I'm a warrior for the Prince of Peace
[3:27:07.500 --> 3:27:13.500]  Am I a fighter, you bet I am
[3:27:13.500 --> 3:27:15.500]  I'll fight for my life
[3:27:15.500 --> 3:27:17.500]  But I won't harm anybody else
[3:27:17.500 --> 3:27:19.500]  It doesn't want to harm me
[3:27:19.500 --> 3:27:21.500]  I respect my neighbors
[3:27:21.500 --> 3:27:23.500]  They respect me
[3:27:23.500 --> 3:27:25.500]  You won't respect me
[3:27:25.500 --> 3:27:27.500]  It's going to come back at you
[3:27:27.500 --> 3:27:29.500]  But no violence
[3:27:29.500 --> 3:27:31.500]  No violence
[3:27:31.500 --> 3:27:33.500]  Only if my life is threatened
[3:27:33.500 --> 3:27:35.500]  Break into my house
[3:27:35.500 --> 3:27:37.500]  I'll blow your brains out
[3:27:37.500 --> 3:27:39.500]  Simple as that
[3:27:43.500 --> 3:27:45.500]  We need a peaceful movement
[3:27:45.500 --> 3:27:47.500]  Freedom, peace and justice
[3:27:47.500 --> 3:27:49.500]  We must have now
[3:27:49.500 --> 3:27:51.500]  If we don't
[3:27:53.500 --> 3:27:55.500]  We're going to be living hell on earth
[3:27:55.500 --> 3:27:57.500]  In the United States
[3:27:57.500 --> 3:27:59.500]  It's underway
[3:27:59.500 --> 3:28:01.500]  It's happening
[3:28:01.500 --> 3:28:03.500]  Do what you can to support Info Wars
[3:28:03.500 --> 3:28:05.500]  They got great products
[3:28:05.500 --> 3:28:07.500]  I put my money where my mouth is
[3:28:07.500 --> 3:28:09.500]  I buy them
[3:28:09.500 --> 3:28:11.500]  I support them
[3:28:11.500 --> 3:28:13.500]  We must keep the truth alive
[3:28:15.500 --> 3:28:17.500]  It's being robbed from us
[3:28:19.500 --> 3:28:21.500]  And get ready for the next war
[3:28:21.500 --> 3:28:23.500]  When all else fails
[3:28:23.500 --> 3:28:25.500]  They take you to war
[3:28:25.500 --> 3:28:27.500]  And this economy is going to fail big time
[3:28:27.500 --> 3:28:29.500]  And when we get back
[3:28:29.500 --> 3:28:31.500]  We're going to talk about it
[3:28:31.500 --> 3:28:33.500]  The worst is yet to come
[3:28:33.500 --> 3:28:35.500]  Like we've never seen before
[3:28:35.500 --> 3:28:37.500]  They're going to open things up
[3:28:37.500 --> 3:28:39.500]  Yeah
[3:28:39.500 --> 3:28:41.500]  Ain't going to work
[3:28:41.500 --> 3:28:43.500]  The ones that are gone
[3:28:43.500 --> 3:29:03.500]  The ones that are gone
[3:29:13.500 --> 3:29:15.500]  The core of it is the Fortune 100
[3:29:15.500 --> 3:29:17.500]  Corporations themselves funded
[3:29:17.500 --> 3:29:19.500]  By a handful of private
[3:29:19.500 --> 3:29:21.500]  Central banking families
[3:29:21.500 --> 3:29:23.500]  The Rothschilds, the Rockefellers
[3:29:23.500 --> 3:29:25.500]  The Dutch and British royalty
[3:29:25.500 --> 3:29:27.500]  Being at the very heart of that
[3:29:27.500 --> 3:29:29.500]  Then you learn the Dutch and British royalty
[3:29:29.500 --> 3:29:31.500]  Aren't even Dutch or British at the same time
[3:29:31.500 --> 3:29:33.500]  But they go back to the literal Count Dracula
[3:29:33.500 --> 3:29:35.500]  And the wars in between
[3:29:35.500 --> 3:29:37.500]  Christendom and Islam
[3:29:37.500 --> 3:29:39.500]  Those that don't know history really are
[3:29:39.500 --> 3:29:41.500]  Doomed to repeat it
[3:29:41.500 --> 3:29:43.500]  That's what the social distancing
[3:29:43.500 --> 3:29:45.500]  The masks are all about
[3:29:45.500 --> 3:29:47.500]  It's about bankrupting local small businesses
[3:29:47.500 --> 3:29:49.500]  And those that comply
[3:29:49.500 --> 3:29:51.500]  Are complying with your own destruction
[3:29:51.500 --> 3:29:53.500]  Wake up
[3:29:53.500 --> 3:29:55.500]  Anybody listening to my voice
[3:29:55.500 --> 3:29:57.500]  Simply search engine the term
[3:29:57.500 --> 3:29:59.500]  Davos Group
[3:29:59.500 --> 3:30:01.500]  Technocracy or technocrats
[3:30:01.500 --> 3:30:03.500]  You will get
[3:30:03.500 --> 3:30:05.500]  Klaus Schwab and John Claude
[3:30:05.500 --> 3:30:07.500]  Junker and all the New World Order
[3:30:07.500 --> 3:30:09.500]  Globalists like Gigi Pink saying
[3:30:09.500 --> 3:30:11.500]  That they no longer want elected leaders
[3:30:11.500 --> 3:30:13.500]  Over governments
[3:30:13.500 --> 3:30:15.500]  That they want businessmen, technocrats over
[3:30:15.500 --> 3:30:17.500]  And that's who Klaus Schwab is
[3:30:17.500 --> 3:30:19.500]  You might want to look into the guy that says
[3:30:19.500 --> 3:30:21.500]  They've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns
[3:30:21.500 --> 3:30:23.500]  To bankrupt you and make you poor
[3:30:23.500 --> 3:30:25.500]  You might want to find out who this super villain is
[3:30:25.500 --> 3:30:27.500]  But you see, he believes because
[3:30:27.500 --> 3:30:29.500]  He's hidden it in plain view
[3:30:29.500 --> 3:30:31.500]  And you're not speaking out against it
[3:30:31.500 --> 3:30:33.500]  That he has the right to do it to you
[3:30:33.500 --> 3:30:35.500]  You might want to find out who he works for
[3:30:35.500 --> 3:30:37.500]  He works directly for Prince Charles
[3:30:37.500 --> 3:30:39.500]  The plan for global sustainability
[3:30:39.500 --> 3:30:41.500]  That means worldwide Neo feudalism
[3:30:41.500 --> 3:30:43.500]  In his own works
[3:30:43.500 --> 3:30:45.500]  So you might want to find out
[3:30:45.500 --> 3:30:47.500]  How he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you
[3:30:47.500 --> 3:30:49.500]  Before you take those shots
[3:30:49.500 --> 3:30:51.500]  You might just want to find out who this villain is
[3:30:51.500 --> 3:30:53.500]  Alright
[3:30:55.500 --> 3:30:57.500]  Ladies and gentlemen
[3:30:57.500 --> 3:30:59.500]  I've studied history
[3:30:59.500 --> 3:31:01.500]  I've interviewed all the experts
[3:31:01.500 --> 3:31:03.500]  I have looked at every facet of this
[3:31:03.500 --> 3:31:05.500]  And now, only days until
[3:31:05.500 --> 3:31:07.500]  I imagine it's all coming into place
[3:31:07.500 --> 3:31:09.500]  That's how they change the subject from election fraud
[3:31:09.500 --> 3:31:11.500]  It's how they change the subject from Hunter's laptop
[3:31:11.500 --> 3:31:13.500]  It's how they change the subject
[3:31:13.500 --> 3:31:15.500]  From Epstein and Obama
[3:31:15.500 --> 3:31:17.500]  And Al Qaeda and the New World Order
[3:31:17.500 --> 3:31:19.500]  And now
[3:31:19.500 --> 3:31:21.500]  Use the already martial law in place
[3:31:21.500 --> 3:31:23.500]  For COVID-19 and that's what it is
[3:31:23.500 --> 3:31:25.500]  To then be expanded and become political
[3:31:25.500 --> 3:31:27.500]  And become permanent
[3:31:27.500 --> 3:31:29.500]  They train you to stay in your houses
[3:31:29.500 --> 3:31:31.500]  They train you to be tracked
[3:31:31.500 --> 3:31:33.500]  They train and do what you're told
[3:31:33.500 --> 3:31:35.500]  And now they launch the storm
[3:31:35.500 --> 3:31:37.500]  The storm is here
[3:31:37.500 --> 3:31:39.500]  It's a globalist storm
[3:31:39.500 --> 3:31:41.500]  There's not going to be martial law for Trump
[3:31:41.500 --> 3:31:43.500]  There's going to be martial law for the globalist
[3:31:43.500 --> 3:31:45.500]  They're trying to set you up
[3:31:45.500 --> 3:31:47.500]  Don't be involved in violence
[3:31:47.500 --> 3:31:49.500]  Expose the New World Order
[3:31:49.500 --> 3:31:51.500]  And expose the takeover with information
[3:31:51.500 --> 3:31:53.500]  That's how we beat these people
[3:31:53.500 --> 3:31:55.500]  With truth
[3:31:57.500 --> 3:31:59.500]  This is taken under the tongue
[3:31:59.500 --> 3:32:01.500]  It is pure turmeric
[3:32:01.500 --> 3:32:03.500]  It goes together
[3:32:03.500 --> 3:32:05.500]  Very well with our body's ultimate turmeric formula
[3:32:05.500 --> 3:32:07.500]  That is taken as a powdered capsule
[3:32:07.500 --> 3:32:09.500]  And absorbed in the stomach
[3:32:09.500 --> 3:32:11.500]  And intestines
[3:32:11.500 --> 3:32:13.500]  This is absorbed under the tongue
[3:32:13.500 --> 3:32:15.500]  Into the bloodstream and then the remaining
[3:32:15.500 --> 3:32:17.500]  Also is then absorbed by the stomach
[3:32:17.500 --> 3:32:19.500]  So it's more of an intense delivery system
[3:32:19.500 --> 3:32:21.500]  The two formulas are different
[3:32:21.500 --> 3:32:23.500]  But both are concentrated
[3:32:23.500 --> 3:32:25.500]  And our first product got rave reviews
[3:32:25.500 --> 3:32:27.500]  We've now been testing this out for several months
[3:32:27.500 --> 3:32:29.500]  Some of our staff like it more than bodies
[3:32:29.500 --> 3:32:31.500]  Some like bodies better
[3:32:31.500 --> 3:32:33.500]  For me, they're both amazing
[3:32:33.500 --> 3:32:35.500]  For their anti-inflammatory acid and so much more
[3:32:35.500 --> 3:32:37.500]  And they fund the M4
[3:32:37.500 --> 3:32:39.500]  So get our new liquid turmeric extract

[3:32:43.500 --> 3:32:45.500]  This is a 360 win
[3:32:45.500 --> 3:32:47.500]  Turmeric is renowned for what it does
[3:32:47.500 --> 3:32:49.500]  For all of our bodies
[3:32:49.500 --> 3:32:51.500]  For inflammation and so much more

[3:33:21.500 --> 3:33:23.500]  We're in unprecedented time
[3:33:23.500 --> 3:33:25.500]  And nothing like this
[3:33:25.500 --> 3:33:27.500]  I've been at this for 40 years
[3:33:27.500 --> 3:33:29.500]  And I've never seen
[3:33:29.500 --> 3:33:31.500]  The world going to hell
[3:33:31.500 --> 3:33:33.500]  Like it is right now
[3:33:33.500 --> 3:33:35.500]  And so few people are leading us there
[3:33:35.500 --> 3:33:37.500]  Everybody's talking about the COVID
[3:33:37.500 --> 3:33:39.500]  COVID
[3:33:39.500 --> 3:33:41.500]  As a report came out
[3:33:41.500 --> 3:33:43.500]  This past weekend
[3:33:43.500 --> 3:33:45.500]  And we're in unprecedented time
[3:33:45.500 --> 3:33:47.500]  And we're in unprecedented time
[3:33:47.500 --> 3:33:49.500]  And we're in unprecedented time
[3:33:49.500 --> 3:33:51.500]  And this past weekend
[3:33:51.500 --> 3:33:53.500]  Over there in
[3:33:53.500 --> 3:33:55.500]  India
[3:33:55.500 --> 3:33:57.500]  78.6%
[3:33:57.500 --> 3:33:59.500]  Of the power it generated
[3:33:59.500 --> 3:34:01.500]  During the day was coal based
[3:34:01.500 --> 3:34:03.500]  So
[3:34:03.500 --> 3:34:05.500]  I'm mentioning that because
[3:34:05.500 --> 3:34:07.500]  1.67 million
[3:34:09.500 --> 3:34:11.500]  Indians die
[3:34:11.500 --> 3:34:13.500]  In other polluted related diseases
[3:34:13.500 --> 3:34:15.500]  It's not only coal
[3:34:15.500 --> 3:34:17.500]  But it's not the cleanest energy to burn
[3:34:17.500 --> 3:34:19.500]  And
[3:34:19.500 --> 3:34:21.500]  1.67 million died last year
[3:34:21.500 --> 3:34:23.500]  I mean it's every year
[3:34:23.500 --> 3:34:25.500]  They're dying
[3:34:25.500 --> 3:34:27.500]  China's about 1.5 million
[3:34:27.500 --> 3:34:29.500]  From air polluted related diseases
[3:34:31.500 --> 3:34:33.500]  All the pesticides
[3:34:33.500 --> 3:34:35.500]  In our food
[3:34:35.500 --> 3:34:37.500]  Chemicals
[3:34:37.500 --> 3:34:39.500]  The preservatives
[3:34:39.500 --> 3:34:41.500]  The artificial flavors
[3:34:41.500 --> 3:34:43.500]  Artificial colors
[3:34:43.500 --> 3:34:45.500]  Still can't drink the water
[3:34:45.500 --> 3:34:47.500]  In Flint
[3:34:47.500 --> 3:34:49.500]  Hey Obama how come you didn't fix that
[3:34:49.500 --> 3:34:51.500]  Not only Flint
[3:34:51.500 --> 3:34:53.500]  All over the country
[3:34:53.500 --> 3:34:55.500]  All over the world
[3:34:55.500 --> 3:34:57.500]  And you worried about the COVID
[3:34:57.500 --> 3:34:59.500]  Again we put out a weekly magazine
[3:34:59.500 --> 3:35:01.500]  The Trends Journal
[3:35:01.500 --> 3:35:03.500]  Only put the facts in there
[3:35:05.500 --> 3:35:07.500]  The death rates
[3:35:07.500 --> 3:35:09.500]  And who's dying
[3:35:09.500 --> 3:35:11.500]  Are facts
[3:35:11.500 --> 3:35:13.500]  In places like
[3:35:13.500 --> 3:35:15.500]  Sweden
[3:35:15.500 --> 3:35:17.500]  For example
[3:35:17.500 --> 3:35:19.500]  Almost the world
[3:35:19.500 --> 3:35:21.500]  90% of the people that are dying
[3:35:21.500 --> 3:35:23.500]  From the virus are over 70 years old
[3:35:27.500 --> 3:35:29.500]  Having pre-existing chronic conditions
[3:35:29.500 --> 3:35:31.500]  Over there in Canada
[3:35:35.500 --> 3:35:37.500]  70%
[3:35:37.500 --> 3:35:39.500]  Of the people that have died
[3:35:39.500 --> 3:35:41.500]  Are from nursing homes
[3:35:41.500 --> 3:35:43.500]  That's right
[3:35:43.500 --> 3:35:45.500]  That's according to government data
[3:35:45.500 --> 3:35:47.500]  And you got these little freaks
[3:35:47.500 --> 3:35:49.500]  Up there
[3:35:49.500 --> 3:35:51.500]  Locking the whole place down
[3:35:53.500 --> 3:35:55.500]  Little freaks
[3:35:55.500 --> 3:35:57.500]  In the tough COVID cops
[3:35:57.500 --> 3:35:59.500]  Breaking people's chops
[3:35:59.500 --> 3:36:01.500]  Finding them
[3:36:03.500 --> 3:36:05.500]  $2,800
[3:36:05.500 --> 3:36:07.500]  For having too many people
[3:36:07.500 --> 3:36:09.500]  Instead of
[3:36:09.500 --> 3:36:11.500]  You only could have four
[3:36:11.500 --> 3:36:13.500]  And you had six
[3:36:13.500 --> 3:36:15.500]  Meanwhile
[3:36:15.500 --> 3:36:17.500]  Crime
[3:36:17.500 --> 3:36:19.500]  Rising
[3:36:19.500 --> 3:36:21.500]  There's a
[3:36:21.500 --> 3:36:23.500]  71% that show
[3:36:23.500 --> 3:36:25.500]  All right
[3:36:25.500 --> 3:36:27.500]  Again
[3:36:27.500 --> 3:36:29.500]  These are the people
[3:36:29.500 --> 3:36:31.500]  That should be taken care of
[3:36:31.500 --> 3:36:33.500]  Why are you locking down
[3:36:33.500 --> 3:36:35.500]  Everybody else
[3:36:35.500 --> 3:36:37.500]  Young people
[3:36:37.500 --> 3:36:39.500]  You know what the
[3:36:39.500 --> 3:36:41.500]  From 1 to 20 years old
[3:36:41.500 --> 3:36:43.500]  The recovery rate is 99.997%
[3:36:43.500 --> 3:36:45.500]  According
[3:36:45.500 --> 3:36:47.500]  To the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention
[3:36:51.500 --> 3:36:53.500]  Yeah, violent crime
[3:36:53.500 --> 3:36:55.500]  When people lose everything
[3:36:55.500 --> 3:36:57.500]  And have nothing left to lose
[3:36:57.500 --> 3:36:59.500]  They lose it
[3:36:59.500 --> 3:37:01.500]  But what are the COVID cops doing
[3:37:01.500 --> 3:37:03.500]  To get the violent crime
[3:37:03.500 --> 3:37:05.500]  That chops the little people
[3:37:05.500 --> 3:37:07.500]  We the little people
[3:37:07.500 --> 3:37:09.500]  We the little people of Slavelandia
[3:37:11.500 --> 3:37:13.500]  Yep
[3:37:13.500 --> 3:37:15.500]  Did you see that
[3:37:15.500 --> 3:37:17.500]  I want to stay on the economy for a bit
[3:37:17.500 --> 3:37:19.500]  Economists revise Eurozone growth
[3:37:19.500 --> 3:37:21.500]  2021 downwards
[3:37:21.500 --> 3:37:23.500]  Amid second
[3:37:23.500 --> 3:37:25.500]  COVID wave
[3:37:25.500 --> 3:37:27.500]  Not second COVID wave
[3:37:27.500 --> 3:37:29.500]  Second lockdown wave
[3:37:31.500 --> 3:37:33.500]  It's one after another
[3:37:41.500 --> 3:37:43.500]  IEA1's renewed
[3:37:43.500 --> 3:37:45.500]  COVID lockdowns
[3:37:45.500 --> 3:37:47.500]  Will depress global crew demand
[3:37:47.500 --> 3:37:49.500]  That's the International
[3:37:49.500 --> 3:37:51.500]  Energy Agency
[3:37:51.500 --> 3:37:53.500]  Low oil prices
[3:37:57.500 --> 3:37:59.500]  It's one after another
[3:37:59.500 --> 3:38:01.500]  You look at the data
[3:38:01.500 --> 3:38:03.500]  It's depressing as can be
[3:38:03.500 --> 3:38:05.500]  But they take care of the bigs
[3:38:05.500 --> 3:38:07.500]  Commercial real estate
[3:38:07.500 --> 3:38:09.500]  Neu gets central bank boosts

[3:38:29.500 --> 3:38:31.500]  You can't pay your mortgage
[3:38:31.500 --> 3:38:33.500]  But Europe's downtown office buildings are empty
[3:38:33.500 --> 3:38:35.500]  And malls and main streets are deserted
[3:38:35.500 --> 3:38:37.500]  Yet the biggest landlords are staying afloat
[3:38:37.500 --> 3:38:39.500]  Thanks to robust
[3:38:39.500 --> 3:38:41.500]  Central bank buying of bonds
[3:38:41.500 --> 3:38:43.500]  Backed by property debt
[3:38:43.500 --> 3:38:45.500]  Not making that up
[3:38:45.500 --> 3:38:47.500]  All right
[3:38:47.500 --> 3:38:49.500]  They get all they want
[3:38:49.500 --> 3:38:51.500]  As George Collins said
[3:38:51.500 --> 3:38:53.500]  It's one big club
[3:38:53.500 --> 3:38:55.500]  And you ain't in it
[3:38:57.500 --> 3:38:59.500]  Eurozone banks reduce lending
[3:38:59.500 --> 3:39:01.500]  As bad debt grows
[3:39:03.500 --> 3:39:05.500]  So where's the economy going
[3:39:05.500 --> 3:39:07.500]  There's going to be a bounce back
[3:39:07.500 --> 3:39:09.500]  Bank of Canada sees
[3:39:09.500 --> 3:39:11.500]  Economy shrinking
[3:39:11.500 --> 3:39:13.500]  In first quarter
[3:39:13.500 --> 3:39:15.500]  As second wave
[3:39:15.500 --> 3:39:17.500]  Makes for choppy recovery
[3:39:17.500 --> 3:39:19.500]  No, not second wave
[3:39:19.500 --> 3:39:21.500]  Makes for choppy recovery
[3:39:21.500 --> 3:39:23.500]  Some little pieces of garbage
[3:39:23.500 --> 3:39:25.500]  Slum crap
[3:39:25.500 --> 3:39:27.500]  Called your premier's
[3:39:27.500 --> 3:39:29.500]  And this and that
[3:39:29.500 --> 3:39:31.500]  How about bankers? Yeah, them
[3:39:31.500 --> 3:39:33.500]  Are locking down everything
[3:39:33.500 --> 3:39:35.500]  Again
[3:39:35.500 --> 3:39:37.500]  As the information shows
[3:39:37.500 --> 3:39:39.500]  I said 70%
[3:39:39.500 --> 3:39:41.500]  They just put up one that showed
[3:39:41.500 --> 3:39:43.500]  80% of the people in Canada
[3:39:43.500 --> 3:39:45.500]  That are dying
[3:39:45.500 --> 3:39:47.500]  From the virus
[3:39:47.500 --> 3:39:49.500]  Are from elder care homes
[3:39:49.500 --> 3:39:51.500]  Oh yes, so Lenti, after they get out
[3:39:51.500 --> 3:39:53.500]  Of elder care homes and they're sick there
[3:39:53.500 --> 3:39:55.500]  Then we send them to day camp
[3:39:55.500 --> 3:39:57.500]  And they start all over again
[3:39:57.500 --> 3:39:59.500]  Look at that little freak
[3:39:59.500 --> 3:40:01.500]  Another daddy's boy
[3:40:01.500 --> 3:40:03.500]  Another little arrogant daddy's boy

[3:40:05.500 --> 3:40:07.500]  And dirty at a home run
[3:40:07.500 --> 3:40:09.500]  You'd be nothing
[3:40:09.500 --> 3:40:11.500]  Of crap if your daddy
[3:40:11.500 --> 3:40:13.500]  Wasn't dead before

[3:40:21.500 --> 3:40:23.500]  Because that's all you are
[3:40:25.500 --> 3:40:27.500]  Look at it, look at the freaks
[3:40:27.500 --> 3:40:29.500]  Running and ruining our lives
[3:40:29.500 --> 3:40:31.500]  Calm down, Lenti
[3:40:31.500 --> 3:40:33.500]  Be a coward like the rest of us

[3:42:03.500 --> 3:42:05.500]  Whatever stadium that was
[3:42:05.500 --> 3:42:07.500]  I stopped going
[3:42:07.500 --> 3:42:09.500]  After they redid the old Yankee Stadium
[3:42:09.500 --> 3:42:11.500]  I went there in the days
[3:42:11.500 --> 3:42:13.500]  The Mickey Mantle
[3:42:13.500 --> 3:42:15.500]  Yogi Berra

[3:42:21.500 --> 3:42:23.500]  And then when they redid the stadium
[3:42:23.500 --> 3:42:25.500]  They made it into junk town
[3:42:25.500 --> 3:42:27.500]  I stopped going
[3:42:27.500 --> 3:42:29.500]  I even went to World Series

[3:42:59.500 --> 3:43:01.500]  Kava is one of the hottest new breakthroughs
[3:43:01.500 --> 3:43:03.500]  In the natural health world today
[3:43:03.500 --> 3:43:05.500]  Though it has been used for hundreds of years
[3:43:05.500 --> 3:43:07.500]  In the Pacific islands
[3:43:07.500 --> 3:43:09.500]  For its relaxation and euphoric effects
[3:43:09.500 --> 3:43:11.500]  According to ancient Samoan
[3:43:11.500 --> 3:43:13.500]  Legend Kava was given as a gift
[3:43:13.500 --> 3:43:15.500]  By the sun god Tagaloa
[3:43:15.500 --> 3:43:17.500]  Who they considered to be the supreme ruler
[3:43:17.500 --> 3:43:19.500]  And creator of the universe
[3:43:19.500 --> 3:43:21.500]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea
[3:43:21.500 --> 3:43:23.500]  During social gatherings
[3:43:23.500 --> 3:43:25.500]  And sacred ceremonies
[3:43:25.500 --> 3:43:27.500]  To loosen up a little
[3:43:27.500 --> 3:43:29.500]  Nowadays Kava is used around the world

[3:43:53.500 --> 3:43:55.500]  And announced a global government corporate alliance
[3:43:55.500 --> 3:43:57.500]  To redistribute wealth
[3:43:57.500 --> 3:43:59.500]  And create a planetary universal income
[3:43:59.500 --> 3:44:01.500]  Which of course the United Nations
[3:44:01.500 --> 3:44:03.500]  And global corporations will control

[3:44:09.500 --> 3:44:11.500]  Part of the UN Great Reset
[3:44:11.500 --> 3:44:13.500]  Of the Debo Scoop and Cloud Schwab
[3:44:13.500 --> 3:44:15.500]  All officially written about in hundreds of books
[3:44:15.500 --> 3:44:17.500]  By Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation
[3:44:17.500 --> 3:44:19.500]  All the rest of them
[3:44:19.500 --> 3:44:21.500]  Are here and only gets worse
[3:44:21.500 --> 3:44:23.500]  Like being fed into a wood chipper
[3:44:23.500 --> 3:44:25.500]  Or a meat grinder until you reject it all
[3:44:27.500 --> 3:44:29.500]  And the rejection starts with
[3:44:29.500 --> 3:44:31.500]  Realizing it's spiritual battle
[3:44:31.500 --> 3:44:33.500]  The first evil and stopping abortion
[3:44:33.500 --> 3:44:35.500]  We must start valuing human life again
[3:44:35.500 --> 3:44:37.500]  We must start saying that we
[3:44:37.500 --> 3:44:39.500]  Are not expendable
[3:44:39.500 --> 3:44:41.500]  That we are not disposable
[3:44:41.500 --> 3:44:43.500]  That we are essential
[3:44:43.500 --> 3:44:45.500]  Until we do that we are all slaves
[3:44:45.500 --> 3:44:47.500]  We must stand up and declare
[3:44:47.500 --> 3:44:49.500]  That we are God-given human rights now
[3:45:17.500 --> 3:45:19.500]  We stole it better than Dallas
[3:45:19.500 --> 3:45:21.500]  And now they're coming after the president
[3:45:21.500 --> 3:45:23.500]  They're coming after you, they're coming after me
[3:45:23.500 --> 3:45:25.500]  They're shutting everybody off
[3:45:25.500 --> 3:45:27.500]  The internet, they're trying to totally censor us
[3:45:27.500 --> 3:45:29.500]  And that's why M4 Wars is still in the fight
[3:45:29.500 --> 3:45:31.500]  Because we knew this was coming
[3:45:31.500 --> 3:45:33.500]  We told you this was coming
[3:45:33.500 --> 3:45:35.500]  We were the first main target and we're still on air

[3:55:05.500 --> 3:55:07.500]  Despite some people's
[3:55:07.500 --> 3:55:09.500]  Skepticism
[3:55:09.500 --> 3:55:11.500]  Health officials
[3:55:11.500 --> 3:55:13.500]  And those who receive health officials
[3:55:13.500 --> 3:55:15.500]  Little born off paces
[3:55:15.500 --> 3:55:17.500]  Of crap
[3:55:17.500 --> 3:55:19.500]  That get bureaucratic jobs
[3:55:19.500 --> 3:55:21.500]  For sucking down and bending over

[3:55:29.500 --> 3:55:31.500]  Another health expert described
[3:55:31.500 --> 3:55:33.500]  The timing between the vaccination
[3:55:33.500 --> 3:55:35.500]  And Aaron's death as coincidental
[3:55:35.500 --> 3:55:41.500]  You are a piece of crap
[3:55:41.500 --> 3:55:43.500]  Crowley who wrote this
[3:55:43.500 --> 3:55:45.500]  Using that kind of language
[3:55:47.500 --> 3:55:49.500]  There he is
[3:55:49.500 --> 3:55:51.500]  Alright
[3:55:51.500 --> 3:55:53.500]  Never saw the picture
[3:55:53.500 --> 3:55:55.500]  But a picture speaks
[3:55:55.500 --> 3:55:57.500]  A thousand words
[3:55:57.500 --> 3:55:59.500]  Crowley crap
[3:55:59.500 --> 3:56:01.500]  Crowley crap
[3:56:01.500 --> 3:56:03.500]  Calling people who question
[3:56:03.500 --> 3:56:05.500]  The man dying
[3:56:07.500 --> 3:56:09.500]  As conspiracy theorists
[3:56:09.500 --> 3:56:11.500]  And pushing out propaganda
[3:56:11.500 --> 3:56:13.500]  But you got to be a prostitute
[3:56:13.500 --> 3:56:15.500]  You got to get paid to put out
[3:56:15.500 --> 3:56:17.500]  By your corporate pimp
[3:56:17.500 --> 3:56:19.500]  And your government whore masters

[3:56:33.500 --> 3:56:35.500]  Last week's magazine was over
[3:56:35.500 --> 3:56:37.500]  A hundred pages
[3:56:37.500 --> 3:56:39.500]  Not one ad
[3:56:39.500 --> 3:56:41.500]  We're doing everything we can

[3:57:07.500 --> 3:57:09.500]  These are critical times
[3:57:09.500 --> 3:57:11.500]  Gold, silver
[3:57:11.500 --> 3:57:13.500]  And I'm still
[3:57:13.500 --> 3:57:15.500]  Well, we have where we see Bitcoin
[3:57:15.500 --> 3:57:17.500]  Going down to before it breaks
[3:57:17.500 --> 3:57:19.500]  Below that point
[3:57:19.500 --> 3:57:21.500]  If it doesn't break below the point

[3:57:23.500 --> 3:57:25.500]  We see it moving higher
[3:57:25.500 --> 3:57:27.500]  That's just on some of the front
[3:57:27.500 --> 3:57:29.500]  The Biden bounce will be quick
[3:57:29.500 --> 3:57:31.500]  It'll be over
[3:57:31.500 --> 3:57:33.500]  The worst, unfortunately, is the yet to come
[3:57:33.500 --> 3:57:35.500]  Unless we unite for freedom, peace and justice
[3:57:35.500 --> 3:57:59.500]  See you next week.
