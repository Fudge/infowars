[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.240 --> 00:29.240]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome to the Alex
[00:29.240 --> 00:34.120]  Jones show on this Tuesday August 3rd 2015 I'm David Knight your host we're going to
[00:34.120 --> 00:39.120]  have some special reports from Alex Jones he's currently in Rome we're going to have
[00:39.120 --> 00:44.160]  his report on the second fall of Rome there's also a report about a eugenics
[00:44.160 --> 00:48.280]  museum that they saw in Spain very difficult to get reports out while they
[00:48.280 --> 00:53.800]  were in Spain because Spain has of course enacted massive attacks against the
[00:53.800 --> 00:58.120]  First Amendment a second Spanish Inquisition if you will anyone who
[00:58.120 --> 01:03.880]  criticizes the government anyone who criticizes the king they are subject to
[01:03.880 --> 01:08.200]  jail sentences you can't even take pictures on the street of things that
[01:08.200 --> 01:13.280]  you would see with Google Maps innocent things like churches museums that sort of
[01:13.280 --> 01:17.040]  thing so we have a report about a Spanish museum that is promoting eugenics
[01:17.040 --> 01:21.200]  that's going to be coming up in the very next segment of course last night we
[01:21.200 --> 01:25.480]  had the first really debate although you can't really call it a debate it
[01:25.480 --> 01:29.480]  happened in New Hampshire it was put on by some local New Hampshire media although
[01:29.480 --> 01:33.920]  there were 14 candidates there Donald Trump was not there he was very wise to
[01:33.920 --> 01:38.160]  set this debate out it was amazing format if you listen to some of it if
[01:38.160 --> 01:43.400]  you were able to say awake through this format it was incredibly slow paced dull
[01:43.400 --> 01:47.040]  but we do have some interesting contrasts and some of the things that
[01:47.040 --> 01:51.680]  people said if you pull some of these things out and listen to them it should
[01:51.680 --> 01:56.560]  wake you up as to what is really going on in this country for the most part I'll
[01:56.560 --> 02:00.520]  just sum it up by saying that if most of these guys who are senators when they're
[02:00.520 --> 02:05.360]  running they want to talk about how necessary it is to track and watch
[02:05.360 --> 02:09.520]  everything that you do to create an Orwellian police state because well you
[02:09.520 --> 02:13.920]  know they're just protecting you about against all these massive plots that are
[02:13.920 --> 02:19.680]  constantly erupting everywhere that the FBI is actually creating now if they are
[02:19.680 --> 02:24.320]  a governor they're going to tell you that they single-handedly created
[02:24.320 --> 02:28.800]  millions of jobs in their state while cutting taxes that's a standard and what
[02:28.800 --> 02:32.080]  they will wind up doing once they're allowed to actually have a debate they
[02:32.080 --> 02:37.020]  will fight amongst themselves as to who can do the most espionage who can start
[02:37.020 --> 02:41.800]  the most wars who can who had the best economic record as governor that's just
[02:41.800 --> 02:47.040]  the basically the way this is going to go however the loose cannon on Thursday is
[02:47.040 --> 02:50.720]  going to be Donald Trump he will I think make it very interesting and perhaps
[02:50.720 --> 02:55.640]  he'll shake things up that they'll be a real genuine debate on some issues we
[02:55.640 --> 02:59.120]  can certainly hope so I look forward to seeing that even though as I've said
[02:59.120 --> 03:04.120]  before I have grave misgivings about some of things and business practices
[03:04.120 --> 03:07.800]  that Donald Trump has done which would keep me from supporting him in any way
[03:07.800 --> 03:12.680]  shape or form it's still interesting to have that debate on policies and I think
[03:12.680 --> 03:16.800]  we have some articles today that are going to show how important it is for
[03:16.800 --> 03:22.720]  people to take action at a local level now certainly in this debate and we'll
[03:22.720 --> 03:26.960]  talk about that debate we'll have clips of it there's also some other news
[03:26.960 --> 03:29.200]  articles that are coming out that I think are very interesting we're going to
[03:29.200 --> 03:32.960]  have Doug Hagman who is going to be joining us in the third hour of Hagman
[03:32.960 --> 03:36.000]  and Hagman we're going to talk about what's going on the Middle East we're
[03:36.000 --> 03:39.520]  going to talk about what's going on with ISIS ISIS in the Middle East ISIS
[03:39.520 --> 03:44.000]  perhaps the United States how about the United States and ISIS how about us
[03:44.000 --> 03:49.560]  helping them creating them training them being there we see yesterday we had
[03:49.560 --> 03:54.960]  articles talking about how British special forces the SAS were dressed up as
[03:54.960 --> 04:00.920]  ISIS fighting in Syria because the objective has always been a war by the
[04:00.920 --> 04:05.840]  West against the Syrian president to take down Assad they have tried everything
[04:05.840 --> 04:09.280]  they could to get a declaration of war to get the people with them and now
[04:09.280 --> 04:13.200]  they're just going on with a secret war a secret war that is escalating we're
[04:13.200 --> 04:18.680]  going to talk about the the increased cost of civilian deaths in that area but
[04:18.680 --> 04:24.240]  let's just take a look for a moment at our beloved Saudi Arabia allies now of
[04:24.240 --> 04:28.600]  course they're having a massive war in Yemen nobody cares about the massive
[04:28.600 --> 04:32.000]  civilian deaths that are going on there or even the reason but here's just the
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.600]  headlines think about these two headlines Saudi Arabia is on track to
[04:36.600 --> 04:41.800]  beat their annual record of 192 beheadings that's far more than any of
[04:41.800 --> 04:45.040]  the eye than the ISIS total even if all the ISIS were real and then this one a
[04:45.040 --> 04:48.840]  Saudi King finally leaves the French Riviera Beach and allows it to reopen
[04:48.840 --> 04:52.240]  with his entourage of a thousand people stay with us we'll be right back with
[04:52.240 --> 04:58.080]  a report on a eugenics museum in Spain
[05:01.520 --> 05:06.960]  as the scandal-ridden Hillary Clinton begins to look less desirable to
[05:06.960 --> 05:12.880]  Democrats Obama's vice president is being touted as a possible candidate
[05:12.880 --> 05:18.800]  according to Politico Joe Biden is a beloved figure in the Democratic Party
[05:18.800 --> 05:23.720]  and a stand-up guy but he's better known around here as the police state
[05:23.720 --> 05:28.480]  candidate Biden has enabled the disastrous drug war and he played a key
[05:28.480 --> 05:34.000]  role in militarizing our nation's police department he has worked tirelessly to
[05:34.000 --> 05:38.960]  destroy the Bill of Rights enable unconstitutional civil asset forfeiture
[05:38.960 --> 05:44.240]  the prospect of Joe Biden taking the Democrat nomination merely reaffirms
[05:44.240 --> 05:49.960]  the fact that the oligarchy in control of America prefers deeply corrupt
[05:49.960 --> 05:55.080]  politicians who could be trusted to carry out the police state agenda you can

[08:27.680 --> 08:32.320]  hour we have several reports from Europe from alex jones and crew who are
[08:32.320 --> 08:36.960]  there alex is in Rome right now coming up right now we have a special report
[08:36.960 --> 08:41.440]  from Spain this is a report that alex directed that rob do narrated this is
[08:41.440 --> 08:47.000]  from valentia Spain it's a museum that promotes racist eugenics here's that
[08:47.000 --> 08:49.400]  report
[08:52.040 --> 08:57.280]  info wars dot com left Barcelona and traveled to Valencia which we heard was
[08:57.280 --> 09:09.000]  the heart of corruption in Spain Valencia is one of the largest and
[09:09.000 --> 09:13.280]  busiest ports in Spain and that in tourism make up two of its largest
[09:13.280 --> 09:15.920]  industries
[09:22.040 --> 09:26.920]  Valencia is also home to the city of arts and sciences which is made up of
[09:26.920 --> 09:35.400]  several buildings of extremely interesting-looking architecture here we
[09:35.400 --> 09:39.440]  see let hemispheric and if you look at it at night from the large reflecting
[09:39.440 --> 09:48.720]  pool it looks like a giant eye it is actually a planetary there's also the
[09:48.720 --> 09:53.800]  very large museum of Prince Philip which was designed to look like giant dinosaur
[09:53.800 --> 10:01.880]  bones then there is legora that looks like a giant breaching whale it is a
[10:01.880 --> 10:08.960]  indoor amphitheater and sporting arena and the elembrechel which is
[10:08.960 --> 10:15.760]  essentially a two-level parking garage topped off with a forest of palm trees
[10:15.760 --> 10:25.080]  very beautiful very unique indeed this is one of the main tourist attractions in
[10:25.080 --> 10:29.680]  Spain and on their website it says science nature and art and in complex
[10:29.680 --> 10:33.480]  devoted to scientific and cultural dissemination in Europe placed in
[10:33.480 --> 10:39.360]  Valencia inside the Museum of Prince Philip I found many exhibits and
[10:39.360 --> 10:44.200]  promotions dedicated to the European Agency of Space which is Europe's
[10:44.200 --> 10:58.680]  version of NASA there's also a very large pendulum and a giant DNA helix the
[10:58.680 --> 11:01.360]  second floor is devoted to the scientists who helped make a lot of our
[11:01.360 --> 11:05.720]  scientific discoveries in the 20th century one of which is a placard
[11:05.720 --> 11:10.960]  dedicated to Bertrand Russell a known eugenicist his placard reads three
[11:10.960 --> 11:15.840]  simple but irresistible passions have governed my life a longing for love the
[11:15.840 --> 11:19.160]  searching for knowledge and the unbearable pity for the suffering of
[11:19.160 --> 11:23.520]  humanity that's right Bertrand Russell cares so much about humanity he also
[11:23.520 --> 11:29.320]  said this here is a clip from in-game gradually by selective breeding the
[11:29.320 --> 11:33.320]  congenital differences between rulers and ruled will increase until they
[11:33.320 --> 11:37.360]  become almost different species a revolt of the plebs would become as
[11:37.360 --> 11:41.360]  unthinkable as an organized insurrection of sheep against the practice of eating
[11:41.360 --> 11:48.680]  mutton Bertrand Russell H.G. Wells oldest Huxley Bertrand Russell and hundreds of
[11:48.680 --> 11:52.760]  other eugenicists constantly bragged about how the establishment believed
[11:52.760 --> 11:58.240]  themselves to be a separate more advanced species in the common man top
[11:58.240 --> 12:02.400]  eugenicists were bold enough to admit their real goal was not improving the
[12:02.400 --> 12:06.600]  heredity of the commoner but to further dumb them down so that they could be more
[12:06.600 --> 12:12.400]  manageable Nobel Prize winner Russell wrote at length about how vaccinations
[12:12.400 --> 12:16.680]  filled with mercury and other brain damaging compounds would induce partial
[12:16.680 --> 12:22.120]  chemical lobotomies and develop a survival zombie population diet
[12:22.120 --> 12:26.760]  injections and injunctions will combine from a very early age to produce the
[12:26.760 --> 12:30.040]  sort of character and the sort of beliefs that the authorities consider
[12:30.040 --> 12:34.080]  desirable and any serious criticism of the powers that be will become
[12:34.080 --> 12:38.720]  psychologically impossible Bertrand Russell and when I got to the third
[12:38.720 --> 12:44.240]  floor of the museum I found it's true dirty secret it is set up to condition
[12:44.240 --> 12:48.720]  the public that genes and chromosomes are meant to be manipulated by scientists
[12:48.720 --> 12:53.520]  here you can see these large gene sequences depicted as a chromosome
[12:53.520 --> 12:58.080]  forest these exhibits are meant to condition the public that science and
[12:58.080 --> 13:02.680]  scientists always have the public's best interest in heart but if you look at
[13:02.680 --> 13:06.800]  the writings of Bertrand Russell you will see it's completely opposite to freedom
[13:06.800 --> 13:12.000]  and liberty so here in Valencia people are being educated and conditioned that
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.240]  eugenicists have their best interest at heart but slowly the veneer of the
[13:16.240 --> 13:20.280]  elites is being lifted most people know that Planned Parenthood was founded by
[13:20.280 --> 13:24.760]  racist eugenicist Margaret Sanger and contrary to their mission statement
[13:24.760 --> 13:29.120]  which is promoting women's health we now see executives haggling over the price
[13:29.120 --> 13:50.400]  of baby parts and now we have John Walsh a man who helped find missing children
[13:50.400 --> 13:55.320]  after his own son was kidnapped and brutally murdered now he is going after
[13:55.320 --> 13:59.880]  mothers who refuse to vaccinate their children it's like the IMF saying
[13:59.880 --> 14:03.440]  Spain is on the way to economic recovery but if you talk to the Spaniards you
[14:03.440 --> 14:07.120]  get a different story four out of five believe the economy is in the same or
[14:07.120 --> 14:11.560]  worse state as the last few years and over half don't believe anything will
[14:11.560 --> 14:16.800]  improve in 2016 in addition there's a massive number of people who are about
[14:16.800 --> 14:20.400]  to come off their two-year unemployment benefits and most of those people are
[14:20.400 --> 14:25.560]  middle-aged and 1.5 million Spaniards rely on soup kitchens as their sole source
[14:25.560 --> 14:30.200]  of food and this is coming from Spain a country that recently passed a series of
[14:30.200 --> 14:34.760]  draconian free speech laws you can't take pictures of police criticize the
[14:34.760 --> 14:38.840]  king of Spain and a man was recently fined for calling police slackers on
[14:38.840 --> 14:44.280]  his Facebook page next info wars is traveling to Rome Italy which is being
[14:44.280 --> 14:49.760]  mired in corruption it is said the mafia controls the local government where
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.640]  recently a knifeman shouting a lot is great forced a tourist to her knees
[14:53.640 --> 14:58.800]  with a blade at the Roman Coliseum rest assured Alex Jones will be reporting
[14:58.800 --> 15:03.240]  live from the Roman Coliseum this is Rob do reporting for info wars calm and
[15:03.240 --> 15:08.400]  prison planet dot TV and again we're gonna have some more reports from Alex
[15:08.400 --> 15:13.760]  Jones in Rome today and we're going to have Doug Hagman joining us in the third
[15:13.760 --> 15:17.880]  hour now last night as we mentioned in the last segment there was a debate in
[15:17.880 --> 15:22.400]  New Hampshire the very first debate it did not have Donald Trump in it and it
[15:22.400 --> 15:26.040]  really wasn't much of a debate it's really pretty amazing as I tweeted out
[15:26.040 --> 15:29.680]  last night they managed to make the candidates as well as the issues look
[15:29.680 --> 15:34.000]  very very trivial here's how the New York Times pointed it out they said
[15:34.000 --> 15:38.320]  there are uneven performances in the Trump lists Republican forum they say
[15:38.320 --> 15:40.840]  Jeb Bush stumble through a familiar question about his brother and his
[15:40.840 --> 15:45.360]  father well actually what they asked him was what's the difference between you
[15:45.360 --> 15:50.720]  and W and he couldn't think of anything really to say because you know what
[15:50.720 --> 15:55.000]  there really isn't any difference he said well we have a little bit of our
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.880]  differences here but you know my dad is just great you know the dad who said
[15:58.880 --> 16:03.480]  read my lips no new taxes and then when he enacted the largest tax increase
[16:03.480 --> 16:07.040]  would ever had at the time and the journalist questioned him on it he was
[16:07.040 --> 16:12.680]  jogging and he said read my hips and ran off that guy that's his the guy he
[16:12.680 --> 16:16.320]  thinks is great now he may think he's great as a father I certainly don't
[16:16.320 --> 16:20.760]  think he's great as a president and you know when you look at the difference
[16:20.760 --> 16:26.240]  between W and Jeb remember that they both helped to kill a disabled woman in
[16:26.240 --> 16:32.200]  Florida killed by a probate judge Terry Shavo how's that for compassionate
[16:32.200 --> 16:37.520]  conservatism she had a husband who wanted her taken off of life support she
[16:37.520 --> 16:42.080]  had a family who said they would take care of her nevertheless a probate judge
[16:42.080 --> 16:46.760]  says no you're you're gonna be taken off arrested Christians who tried to give
[16:46.760 --> 16:52.080]  her water and food many people said she was able to communicate with them the
[16:52.080 --> 16:56.320]  governor of Florida Jeb Bush would not lift a hand to stop that probate judge
[16:56.320 --> 17:01.000]  from slowly starving Terry Shavo to death neither would the president at the
[17:01.000 --> 17:06.120]  time his brother we also had some other admissions from Chris Christie kind of
[17:06.120 --> 17:11.000]  awkwardly they said said am I washed up because the guy was asking him do you
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.520]  think you missed your window of opportunity in 2012 when you didn't
[17:13.520 --> 17:19.520]  make it you're running again and this admission of course we had Lindsey Graham
[17:19.520 --> 17:24.640]  come out and really go for the jugular with the Clintons bringing up the fact
[17:24.640 --> 17:30.800]  that Bill had lied about having sex with a woman Mr. Graham said when Bill
[17:30.800 --> 17:34.720]  says I didn't have sex with that woman he did and I guess that's just because
[17:34.720 --> 17:40.120]  it's so amazing to Lindsey that anyone would have sex with a woman but didn't
[17:40.120 --> 17:43.480]  really talk about the fact that he committed perjury just talked about the
[17:43.480 --> 17:48.880]  fact that he was unfaithful to Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton the Democrats
[17:48.880 --> 17:53.800]  who's leading runner leading candidate at this point looks like she's liable to
[17:53.800 --> 17:58.960]  be indicted looking at the CEO of Starbucks that's how desperate things
[17:58.960 --> 18:03.520]  are on the Democrat side as the New York Times pointed out this format that
[18:03.520 --> 18:07.920]  they had in New Hampshire seemed to shrink the candidates absolutely they
[18:07.920 --> 18:10.360]  said they looked at times like they were being forced to set through a tedious
[18:10.360 --> 18:13.920]  school assembly they would call them out one at a time from backstage and have
[18:13.920 --> 18:19.840]  them set in a chair extremely slow-paced extremely boring and one of the
[18:19.840 --> 18:23.880]  things that was really kind of funny and creepy at the same time they had this
[18:23.880 --> 18:27.320]  breathless female announcer as they would take their seat on the stage one
[18:27.320 --> 18:31.680]  at a time next to the people who were talking to them this this female
[18:31.680 --> 18:35.520]  announcer would give little snippets of their background one or two things
[18:35.520 --> 18:39.440]  about them and it you know or their hobbies or interests you know it sounded
[18:39.440 --> 18:44.320]  like a beauty contest which really was what it was I really expected them to
[18:44.320 --> 18:47.600]  introduce one of these candidates and say well you know this is Lindsey Graham
[18:47.600 --> 18:51.960]  he likes to knit sweaters and do Sudoku puzzles here he is because it was just
[18:51.960 --> 18:56.560]  about that relevant we're gonna have some clips from that that I do think
[18:56.560 --> 19:00.520]  there were some relevant things to look at and discuss that were mentioned in
[19:00.520 --> 19:06.080]  that but the format itself and the way the government operates itself is
[19:06.080 --> 19:10.000]  something that is worthy of comment the fact that as I mentioned in the last
[19:10.000 --> 19:12.880]  segment all the governors are just going to debate each other as to who
[19:12.880 --> 19:17.800]  created the most jobs no you just get out of the way the private sector creates
[19:17.800 --> 19:22.520]  the jobs you can lower taxes you can get out of the way but they love to have
[19:22.520 --> 19:24.840]  these debates that's what they're going to be debating about and then the
[19:24.840 --> 19:30.040]  senators like to talk about how experienced they are in terms of warfare
[19:30.040 --> 19:34.840]  in terms of government surveillance how they can jack up the police state
[19:34.840 --> 19:39.800]  except for one and we're going to show you that contrast later on in the show

[24:25.280 --> 24:28.160]  the news we're going to talk about economic news Alex Jones of course is
[24:28.160 --> 24:34.080]  in Europe looking at the situation there the globalist takeover of Europe as
[24:34.080 --> 24:38.480]  well as the economic crises that have already happened that are continuing to
[24:38.480 --> 24:42.920]  happen and we have a story up at info wars.com crashing Apple Twitter oil
[24:42.920 --> 24:47.760]  commodities Greek stocks Chinese stocks a month of August has started off with a
[24:47.760 --> 24:51.920]  bang we're going to talk about that and what's behind that but before we do want
[24:51.920 --> 24:54.920]  to let you know that one thing that's come down you can be glad about and
[24:54.920 --> 25:01.680]  that's the price on B12 we have a flash sale a 24-hour sale 30% off of secret

[25:54.400 --> 25:59.520]  got another report coming up from Alex Jones filed from Rome the second fall
[25:59.520 --> 26:04.520]  of Rome but everything is falling right now many people we just had a
[26:04.520 --> 26:11.040]  investor calling us from Germany yesterday talking about how concerned he
[26:11.040 --> 26:16.560]  was about the next couple of months we've had one economics analyst after the
[26:16.560 --> 26:20.200]  other on the show talking about how concerned they were about what might
[26:20.200 --> 26:24.840]  happen this fall it has already begun in the month of August this is an article
[26:24.840 --> 26:28.640]  from Michael Schneider that is up on info wars.com and he goes through these
[26:28.640 --> 26:31.680]  things one at a time first one of course is Apple he says is really more of a
[26:31.680 --> 26:36.440]  correction than a crash but Apple stocks are down nearly 11% which places the
[26:36.440 --> 26:43.480]  stock into a correction area Twitter is 58% below their peak in January of 2014
[26:43.480 --> 26:47.560]  of course the Greek government has reported opened up the stock market
[26:47.560 --> 26:53.360]  yesterday and it collapsed essentially the bank shares plummeted 30% they said
[26:53.360 --> 26:56.920]  before loss limits kicked in to automatically stop investors from
[26:56.920 --> 27:02.840]  selling any more the index was down 16.2% for the day that's the first day
[27:02.840 --> 27:05.840]  they've had trading for a couple of weeks they said it was worse daily
[27:05.840 --> 27:12.680]  performance since 1985 when they began taking records including a 15% fall when
[27:12.680 --> 27:16.680]  Wall Street crashed in 1987 worst day they've had since they started taking
[27:16.680 --> 27:20.600]  records in Greece and again there's Puerto Rico I have a little bit more
[27:20.600 --> 27:25.120]  information about that as he points out it is America's Greece and we're going
[27:25.120 --> 27:28.440]  to talk about what happens so there's a couple more articles about Puerto Rico
[27:28.440 --> 27:34.800]  just by itself China for example a 13.5% decline during the month of July in
[27:34.800 --> 27:38.840]  Chinese stocks many people are concerned that it's not just the stock market
[27:38.840 --> 27:45.240]  collapsing from massive margin calls but maybe there's fundamental problems with
[27:45.240 --> 27:49.520]  the Chinese market you think? I mean Gerald Salenty pointed this out when I
[27:49.520 --> 27:54.120]  talked to him at the end of the year he said look nobody is talking about the
[27:54.120 --> 27:58.240]  over-inflated real estate market and other issues that are happening in China
[27:58.240 --> 28:03.040]  in the United States press he goes you can see it all in the Chinese press but
[28:03.040 --> 28:07.960]  nobody in Wall Street nobody in New York or the mainstream media is talking
[28:07.960 --> 28:10.800]  about it now we're starting to see that and then of course there's oil and
[28:10.800 --> 28:15.080]  commodities and the months prior to the financial crash of 2008 the price of oil
[28:15.080 --> 28:20.760]  crashed hard now it's happening again in July the price of oil plunged 21%
[28:20.760 --> 28:27.160]  say it's falling demand the reason that the price of oil is falling so rapidly
[28:27.160 --> 28:32.840]  is because Saudi Arabia has not cut production even though demand has
[28:32.840 --> 28:38.240]  collapsed for oil and that collapsing demand which is reflective of a collapsing
[28:38.240 --> 28:42.400]  economic situation is also reflected in other commodities he points out we see
[28:42.400 --> 28:47.360]  the Bloomberg Commodities Index now at a 13 year low copper is down 28% for the
[28:47.360 --> 28:55.280]  year 10 is down 30% nickel is down 44% and on and on and on so Puerto Rico
[28:55.280 --> 28:59.960]  Puerto Rico officially defaulted yesterday the first time that's happened
[28:59.960 --> 29:07.800]  they paid only $628,000 of a 58 million dollar debt 58 million dollars and they
[29:07.800 --> 29:13.040]  paid about half a million dollars less than 1% of the debt that was due on
[29:13.040 --> 29:16.600]  Monday to creditors here's the interesting thing they point out the
[29:16.600 --> 29:21.640]  debt is mostly owned by ordinary Puerto Ricans through credit unions so it's
[29:21.640 --> 29:25.960]  hitting ordinary people especially hard it's not just the big bankers who are
[29:25.960 --> 29:29.680]  getting hit by this they talk about people who have come of one particular
[29:29.680 --> 29:33.400]  guy who's immigrated with his wife to Austin he worked for the government but
[29:33.400 --> 29:37.280]  there are those who cannot leave those who have businesses they are tied there
[29:37.280 --> 29:41.200]  they don't have any way to get that money out of there or to get themselves out
[29:41.200 --> 29:44.440]  stay with us we'll be right back
[29:47.560 --> 29:54.600]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[29:54.600 --> 30:03.560]  network and what could only be described as the most mind-boggling spin
[30:03.560 --> 30:08.200]  possible Planned Parenthood is now claiming that it helps prevent abortions
[30:08.200 --> 30:13.120]  in response to moves by Republicans in Congress to defund the organization which
[30:13.120 --> 30:17.800]  receives over half a billion dollars per year in taxpayer funds Planned Parenthood
[30:17.800 --> 30:22.240]  tweeted the following Republicans indignant about abortion are trying to
[30:22.240 --> 30:28.680]  destroy a government program that helps prevent 345,000 abortions a year to
[30:28.680 --> 30:32.320]  which one person responded an organization claims it is preventing
[30:32.320 --> 30:38.560]  abortions while executing almost 400,000 abortions in 2013 and of course this
[30:38.560 --> 30:42.520]  latest push happened when groups and organizations connected to Planned
[30:42.520 --> 30:46.680]  Parenthood were caught on video shopping up body parts and having
[30:46.680 --> 30:50.560]  individuals say that they wanted to use the proceeds of said body parts to
[30:50.560 --> 30:57.960]  purchase Lamborghinis you can find more reports on infowars.com

[33:46.440 --> 33:54.920]  run into many many basically copies that have been inspired to get out of this
[33:54.920 --> 34:03.960]  structure and of course you could see a captured obelisk from Egypt from back in
[34:03.960 --> 34:08.680]  Roman times and once the Christians took over Rome they stuck across top of it
[34:08.680 --> 34:14.880]  so culture built on top of culture and we've run into a lot of listeners while
[34:14.880 --> 34:18.480]  we've been here so that's certainly exciting showing people aren't away
[34:18.480 --> 34:25.680]  just had a fella walk over just a moment ago but you can see the Egyptian
[34:25.680 --> 34:32.880]  inscribed the carved and the hieroglyphs on the stone with the cross and then
[34:32.880 --> 34:39.480]  there it is the reason this building is so important is that it's the only
[34:39.480 --> 34:45.800]  Roman structure from what I've read that remained that basically a hundred percent intact during
[34:45.800 --> 34:53.240]  the second main sacking of Rome and the final sacking in 410 by Alaric the
[34:53.240 --> 34:58.280]  Visigoth chieftain they brought a lot of Germans and people in not as slaves in
[34:58.280 --> 35:02.400]  the last few hundred years of the Roman Empire but basically as citizens and
[35:02.400 --> 35:07.020]  even let them get on welfare and then so more of the Germans came more of the
[35:07.020 --> 35:11.680]  Gauls came from France until they had no respect for Rome and just came in and
[35:11.680 --> 35:14.920]  took it over that's why you hear historians say the United States and
[35:14.920 --> 35:18.120]  many other Western governments are repeating what happened to Rome they
[35:18.120 --> 35:23.960]  also debased their currency and by no means my historian I'm just going off
[35:23.960 --> 35:27.720]  the basic history of this but ever since I was a kid watching PBS and reading books
[35:27.720 --> 35:35.120]  I marveled at this structure because so much again of Western culture is based
[35:35.120 --> 35:39.400]  on it the beautiful architecture the capitals on top the pillars simply
[35:39.400 --> 35:44.280]  amazing this is a church so they have loud speakers some people shh every few
[35:44.280 --> 35:47.920]  minutes but we'll see if I'm entering it while people are loud or when they've
[35:47.920 --> 35:53.920]  already been here we enter the big arches you see the domes on most of our
[35:53.920 --> 35:59.800]  capitals again copies of this this is still one of the largest solid domes in
[35:59.800 --> 36:08.520]  the world you see this archetype repeated in like Superman when they
[36:08.520 --> 36:11.440]  sent him to the Phantom Zone the dome opens that shoots to the hole in the
[36:11.440 --> 36:18.480]  roof it's based on this this is originally a temple the Roman gods and
[36:18.480 --> 36:25.000]  they had Roman gods in these different niches they were removed and Christian
[36:25.000 --> 36:34.240]  saints were put in their place but this dates back to the founding of the modern
[36:34.240 --> 36:44.920]  Christian church here in Rome and of course St. Peter in full wars traveling
[36:44.920 --> 36:53.360]  the world trying to look at history so that we're not doing to repeat it you
[36:53.360 --> 36:59.520]  have a lot of Christian symbols this is the original marble oh the key point I
[36:59.520 --> 37:04.240]  haven't gotten to yet why is this the only Roman structure that stayed
[37:04.240 --> 37:12.160]  completely intact that's because when the Visigoth chiefs in Alaric walked
[37:12.160 --> 37:15.960]  through that door after sacking the rest of the cut of the northern part of the
[37:15.960 --> 37:20.480]  country in Rome itself back then it wasn't a country Italy was just held
[37:20.480 --> 37:24.120]  and sold by Rome like all the rest of the countries when he walked through that
[37:24.120 --> 37:31.920]  door and walked to this point here in the middle he was so stunned with his
[37:31.920 --> 37:36.960]  chiefs that they believe this actually was the abode of the gods and it was the
[37:36.960 --> 37:42.880]  only structure they didn't burn or loot to the ground because imagine walking
[37:42.880 --> 37:48.160]  through those doors when they grown up in that chutted villages in Germany and
[37:48.160 --> 37:57.120]  in what is Austria today coming in here and seeing this and witnessing it as the
[37:57.120 --> 38:01.720]  city burned outside around them and as the women were drug off into slavery as
[38:01.720 --> 38:08.480]  the men were killed and as Rome ceased to be a Roman city and became a
[38:08.480 --> 38:15.080]  Germanic city then history repeated yet again and it became a city held by
[38:15.080 --> 38:20.000]  different invading armies through the next few hundred years as well but
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.920]  Christianity prevailed through it all you can criticize a lot of the forms of
[38:23.920 --> 38:27.760]  it that were here but at least some of the culture was passed on today and is
[38:27.760 --> 38:33.160]  now still the dominant maxim here and I love how there's fascist stuff mixed in
[38:33.160 --> 38:36.360]  with it when I say fascist I don't mean Mussolini that started the fascist
[38:36.360 --> 38:42.520]  movement that Hitler picked up on in Franco but the symbol of the imperial
[38:42.520 --> 38:48.280]  government with the eagle with the fasci the bundled sticks held and bound by
[38:48.280 --> 38:52.680]  its feet and of course hatchets on the end so you've got still some of the
[38:52.680 --> 38:59.840]  Roman imperial symbols mixed into here we are having highly produced HD pieces
[38:59.840 --> 39:04.040]  that we're putting together they get into how world government's emanating now
[39:04.040 --> 39:09.040]  more and more out of Europe and how the Vatican was behind the EU and there's no
[39:09.040 --> 39:13.120]  doubt now that the new Pope is announcing world government and world
[39:13.120 --> 39:18.520]  carbon taxes so we're going to be having special reports on that and a lot
[39:18.520 --> 39:23.200]  more but here we are in this historic site Alex Jones signing off for now at
[39:23.200 --> 39:27.560]  info wars dot com more reports coming please stay with us and spread the word
[39:27.560 --> 39:33.800]  to your friends and family and again as Alex mentioned we have HD reports that
[39:33.800 --> 39:36.760]  are on their way if you didn't see that first if you're not watching this
[39:36.760 --> 39:39.840]  broadcast live but if you're listening to it you need to see that very first
[39:39.840 --> 39:45.720]  broadcast amazing video footage out of Spain that museum not only is the
[39:45.720 --> 39:49.200]  content interesting but the footage is stunning there's going to be more of
[39:49.200 --> 39:53.640]  that we have a report coming up later on but you do need to see those those
[39:53.640 --> 39:59.640]  reports there's a lot of video content in them now in a update on a story we
[39:59.640 --> 40:04.160]  started covering yesterday remember we talked about how it was last week that
[40:04.160 --> 40:10.280]  a North Carolina congressman introduced a bill to have Boehner vacate the
[40:10.280 --> 40:15.600]  speaker ship and everybody just kind of scoffed at it and said it's gonna go
[40:15.600 --> 40:19.520]  nowhere there's a well we didn't hear anything about it for a few days and
[40:19.520 --> 40:24.520]  what we learned yesterday was that it's been that they were going to initially
[40:24.520 --> 40:29.160]  bring this thing up for a vote and they were going to shut it down right away
[40:29.160 --> 40:33.960]  but that didn't happen because they started checking around and they found
[40:33.960 --> 40:37.680]  that it was very likely that John Boehner was going to get thrown out of
[40:37.680 --> 40:42.480]  the speakership and now we have some more updates to this I put this under the
[40:42.480 --> 40:48.360]  category of what the Germans call Schadenfreude kind of a dark joy I like
[40:48.360 --> 40:51.840]  to see John Boehner twisting on the end of this rope and he's going to be there
[40:51.840 --> 40:55.920]  for several weeks as they're on August recess they wanted to clear this thing
[40:55.920 --> 41:00.040]  out of the way but now here's a report from W&D they say Boehner may have to
[41:00.040 --> 41:04.320]  cut a deal with Nancy Pelosi to save his job see that's one of the reasons why
[41:04.320 --> 41:08.840]  Boehner is in trouble because he's been cutting deals with the likes of Nancy
[41:08.840 --> 41:13.040]  Pelosi and the people that they both work for he hasn't been doing what the
[41:13.040 --> 41:19.160]  voters sent him to do he has repudiated the results of this election he
[41:19.160 --> 41:23.400]  refuses to do anything that the Republican base wants him to do and he's
[41:23.400 --> 41:29.240]  become very punitive about the people who actually do try to represent their
[41:29.240 --> 41:33.040]  voters back home those people get thrown out of committees so here's what they
[41:33.040 --> 41:36.840]  say on W&D they say the house just went in August recess but Capitol Hill is a
[41:36.840 --> 41:40.120]  buzz with political intrigue over the fate of one of the most powerful men in
[41:40.120 --> 41:46.360]  Congress speaker John Boehner of Ohio whose hold on power suddenly came became
[41:46.360 --> 41:50.720]  in serious jeopardy they say the questions of the hour are what will Boehner
[41:50.720 --> 41:55.360]  do to keep his job will he cut a deal with the Democrats to stay in power if
[41:55.360 --> 42:00.000]  so what would he give them now here's how this breaks down numerically and
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.560]  that's why this I find this interesting as an update they look at the fact that
[42:04.560 --> 42:09.720]  his speakership hangs on just five votes here's how that math breaks down 218
[42:09.720 --> 42:15.040]  votes be needed to oust him if all 188 Democrats voted to oust him
[42:15.040 --> 42:21.000]  Conservatives would need only 30 Republicans to vote to oust him 25 Republicans
[42:21.000 --> 42:26.560]  have previously voted to remove Boehner so you see there they've already had
[42:26.560 --> 42:31.480]  25 people vote to remove him they only need 30 Republicans to do it and they
[42:31.480 --> 42:39.240]  need a solid a solid Democrats to do that and so it's going to be very
[42:39.240 --> 42:42.560]  interesting to see what happens they say 30 to 60 conservative House
[42:42.560 --> 42:47.480]  Republicans already often vote against Boehner to varying degrees and here's
[42:47.480 --> 42:50.960]  what former congressman Steve Stockman said he said the speaker will cut a
[42:50.960 --> 42:55.320]  deal with Nancy Pelosi as he has done in the past this is nothing new and he
[42:55.320 --> 43:00.440]  said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi may try to exact a high price for this
[43:00.440 --> 43:05.320]  of course because she knows how desperately he needs some Democrats to
[43:05.320 --> 43:10.040]  defect then that brings up the issue is that if he's seen dealing once more
[43:10.040 --> 43:15.600]  with Democrats going against conservative voters wishes that may cause
[43:15.600 --> 43:21.920]  him to lose even more Republicans as he picks up some Democrats so as they said
[43:21.920 --> 43:29.840]  in as they said in what was that movie we're in a tight spot now I'm a man and
[43:29.840 --> 43:33.840]  constant sorrow that's what we need to have with brother where art thou that's
[43:33.840 --> 43:36.760]  why I was trying to remember just as they were in the barn and it was being
[43:36.760 --> 43:40.640]  set on fire and they said we're in a tight spot now well you know that's John
[43:40.640 --> 43:46.680]  Boehner he's up in his house they have set the Republican House on fire and he
[43:46.680 --> 43:52.560]  may need to vacate his seat they point out this is a quote from Meadows the
[43:52.560 --> 43:56.920]  North Carolina congressman he said it's not just me he said it's a number of
[43:56.920 --> 44:02.080]  people who vote their conscience and then they're punished either in a direct
[44:02.080 --> 44:05.920]  or an indirect way for doing so it really thwarts their efforts to
[44:05.920 --> 44:11.320]  represent the people that have sent them to Washington to vote on their behalf
[44:11.320 --> 44:17.720]  see Boehner is the perfect crony capitalist I say what they need to do is
[44:17.720 --> 44:22.000]  if he's gonna tell people it's gonna be my way or the highway tell him take the
[44:22.000 --> 44:26.400]  highway take it back to a retirement home where you can play golf John Boehner
[44:26.400 --> 44:31.120]  and I think as I said before this is something that Democrats as well as
[44:31.120 --> 44:37.880]  Republicans and independents can all get behind and I think we all should do
[44:37.880 --> 44:42.000]  what we can to try to get John Boehner out of the speakership now Alex Jones is
[44:42.000 --> 44:45.280]  going to be joining us in the next segment he's going to be calling us from
[44:45.280 --> 44:50.200]  Rome he's going to be calling us live we have some updates on some surveillance
[44:50.200 --> 44:55.800]  issues this is a very interesting story Italy cracks the mafia sheep code to
[44:55.800 --> 45:00.680]  arrest the godfather's henchmen you see it's not just black hats and white hats
[45:00.680 --> 45:05.600]  who are fighting back and forth over encryption is also black sheep and white
[45:05.600 --> 45:10.000]  sheep in this ancient story it's something that reminds us that of course
[45:10.000 --> 45:13.760]  people have done various things and during war and of course they are at
[45:13.760 --> 45:18.560]  war with the government the mafia are during war during other times people
[45:18.560 --> 45:24.560]  will come up with any kind of ingenuity to encode things but people also do it
[45:24.560 --> 45:28.240]  for privacy let me just give you this story here this Italian police on Monday
[45:28.240 --> 45:32.400]  arrested 11 suspects linked to the fugitive head of a Sicilian mafia
[45:32.400 --> 45:36.680]  now this guy is very old he was once very powerful he's no longer very powerful
[45:36.680 --> 45:39.240]  that's one of the reasons that they got to him but the way they were passing
[45:39.240 --> 45:44.840]  information back and forth this has an age-old method of Pazzini bits of paper
[45:44.840 --> 45:49.560]  that contained messages written in cipher now these are not sophisticated ciphers
[45:49.560 --> 45:55.120]  like we saw with the enigma machine in World War two or since he doesn't have
[45:55.120 --> 45:59.880]  a heavy-duty encryption what they would do is put things like I've got the
[45:59.880 --> 46:04.240]  ricotta cheese aside for you will you come by later or the sheep need shearing
[46:04.240 --> 46:08.800]  the shears need sharpening or the hay is ready and they'd already agreed as to
[46:08.800 --> 46:12.480]  what that was going to mean very simple encryption that sort of thing has been
[46:12.480 --> 46:18.280]  done all the time but now of course our government is looking at backdoors of
[46:18.280 --> 46:23.560]  encryption and we've got of all people Michael Chertoff warning us about this
[46:23.560 --> 46:29.440]  Michael Chertoff the first head of Homeland Security after the Patriot Act
[46:29.440 --> 46:33.160]  was passed then he goes on to work for the people that gave us those wonderful
[46:33.160 --> 46:38.520]  TSA x-ray machines he made a lot of money doing that now he's moved on to the
[46:38.520 --> 46:42.960]  other side apparently to some degree he's now become a lobbyist for tech
[46:42.960 --> 46:47.880]  companies who don't like the constant spine so Michael Chertoff says this and
[46:47.880 --> 46:52.720]  it's the truth but it's amazing to hear it coming out of his mouth he says it's
[46:52.720 --> 46:55.960]  a mistake to require companies that are making hardware and software to build a
[46:55.960 --> 47:00.840]  duplicate key or backdoor we do not historically organize our society to
[47:00.840 --> 47:04.840]  make it maximally easy for law enforcement even with court orders to
[47:04.840 --> 47:11.920]  get information now we're reordering our society to make it maximally easy for
[47:11.920 --> 47:15.760]  those who are in the military industrial complex like Michael Chertoff to make
[47:15.760 --> 47:20.840]  money but of course our privacy if you're going to shake people down with the
[47:20.840 --> 47:23.400]  machines that he built if you're going to shake people down with the
[47:23.400 --> 47:27.080]  administration that he served Patriot Act Homeland Security we shouldn't be
[47:27.080 --> 47:31.520]  surprised that it takes this tack he's absolutely right we should not make it
[47:31.520 --> 47:36.560]  our first priority to see how easy we can make it for law enforcement that's
[47:36.560 --> 47:40.800]  not the way society should be organized however that's the way FBI Director
[47:40.800 --> 47:44.440]  James Comey wants it organized he says encryption threatens to lead all of us
[47:44.440 --> 47:52.080]  into a very dark place justice may be denied because of a locked phone or an
[47:52.080 --> 47:56.760]  encrypted hard drive and I've just been informed that we do have Alex Jones is
[47:56.760 --> 48:03.640]  on the phone he has is calling in from Rome thanks for joining us Alex yes
[48:03.640 --> 48:07.720]  David calling in to follow my report here today thank you for sitting here
[48:07.720 --> 48:12.200]  watching you via Skype right now doing an excellent job and again I'll be back
[48:12.200 --> 48:17.440]  this Sunday for the audience gonna say great job to the crew there in Austin
[48:17.440 --> 48:24.360]  Texas and yourself but again Alex Jones reporting from Rome Italy and of course
[48:24.360 --> 48:28.640]  we're gonna be filing some more reports tonight and tomorrow video reports at
[48:28.640 --> 48:35.640]  info wars calm and prison planet calm but looking at world news looking at the
[48:35.640 --> 48:40.320]  big developments I just want the audience to know that we're gonna be focusing
[48:40.320 --> 48:45.600]  pretty much exclusively now after doing some historical background bracing down
[48:45.600 --> 48:52.400]  the tyranny of the EU on the metamorphosis of the Vatican undoubtedly
[48:52.400 --> 49:00.960]  into the heart of a world government tyranny promoting machine we've seen
[49:00.960 --> 49:07.560]  nothing or heard nothing from the Jesuit Pope about the Planned Parenthood scandal
[49:07.560 --> 49:12.680]  we have only heard about communism and socialism being wonderful and carbon
[49:12.680 --> 49:18.360]  taxes being wonderful in the EU being wonderful and you know the rest of it and
[49:18.360 --> 49:24.600]  just you know basically how wonderful it is to have different groups different
[49:24.600 --> 49:28.360]  lifestyles being able to marry each other so they're replacing our real rights
[49:28.360 --> 49:35.080]  with all of these synthetic rights but I wanted to just put this in context for
[49:35.080 --> 49:40.360]  everyone if you look at the video that's up on info wars calm I know you're gonna
[49:40.360 --> 49:45.520]  be covering more in the next hour fifth Planned Parenthood video official
[49:45.520 --> 49:51.320]  brags the whole bodies of babies are just a matter of line items and notice
[49:51.320 --> 49:55.960]  it doesn't matter if a judge puts out a gag order you're you're involved with
[49:55.960 --> 50:00.640]  the murder of children and their bodies being sold the information can and will
[50:00.640 --> 50:05.040]  come out nothing will stop the signal these corrupt elites aren't better than
[50:05.040 --> 50:09.600]  us they aren't invincible we've just laid down and let them take control and so
[50:09.600 --> 50:13.520]  now they're running a month now they're running wild now they're falling to their
[50:13.520 --> 50:19.680]  senator of gravity which is total total oppression but when you go and watch
[50:19.680 --> 50:25.720]  this video they talk about how whole bodies can be delivered and that's what
[50:25.720 --> 50:30.600]  they don't want to be released is the next video of them behind closed doors

[54:46.760 --> 54:52.240]  talks to well-spoken focused people and they respond and say yes we can't have
[54:52.240 --> 54:56.200]  people getting in the way of Hillary we've got to ban freedom we've got to
[54:56.200 --> 55:01.920]  ban the Bill of Rights so you have to understand this is a cult of nobody
[55:01.920 --> 55:06.920]  control freaks who worship at the flame of tyranny and we've seen this over and
[55:06.920 --> 55:11.720]  over again in history in mouth China and Hitler's Germany these people are
[55:11.720 --> 55:17.360]  deadly vicious and dangerous and they will sit back as your in my view as
[55:17.360 --> 55:21.760]  your home as your family are conscripted they will sit back as you are
[55:21.760 --> 55:26.760]  pressing they will sit back as you were enslaved and we know they'll sit back as
[55:26.760 --> 55:32.200]  as millions of babies are killed a year hundreds of thousands of them after the
[55:32.200 --> 55:36.400]  seven months or well into the third trimester that starts in the sixth and
[55:36.400 --> 55:40.600]  a half month and they are selling their full bodies they are selling their
[55:40.600 --> 55:44.920]  organs this has been well known well known for decades we've covered it in
[55:44.920 --> 55:49.320]  films but but finally it's got the public's attention and so the Democratic
[55:49.320 --> 55:53.840]  Party's response another story on info wars.com is the Democrats who voted
[55:53.840 --> 55:57.880]  against defunding Planned Parenthood never even watched the expose videos
[55:57.880 --> 56:01.880]  because when they get asked about it they say never saw it well that's like
[56:01.880 --> 56:06.480]  saying you never saw your neighbor raping your daughter no you knew it was
[56:06.480 --> 56:10.080]  going on just for some reason you let it happen so so this is their plausible
[56:10.080 --> 56:13.200]  deniability oh we don't know about world government we don't know about the
[56:13.200 --> 56:17.520]  stock market being fixed we don't know about the LIBOR rates being fixed with
[56:17.520 --> 56:21.680]  the interest rates we don't know we don't know we didn't know glyphosate
[56:21.680 --> 56:27.920]  grows tumors like the equivalent of miracle grow for plants that's basically
[56:27.920 --> 56:32.760]  what it is just tumor you know miracle tumor grow you know we didn't know
[56:32.760 --> 56:35.800]  fluoride brain damage yeah oh that's just why you put it in the water and
[56:35.800 --> 56:40.480]  admitted it back in the 40s you know he went to Nuremberg heard the Nazis talk
[56:40.480 --> 56:43.720]  about it they got it from the Russians they said hell let's spike these people's
[56:43.720 --> 56:48.120]  water that'll make them behave and it sure has you sure has you I mean we are
[56:48.120 --> 56:53.160]  in a science fiction movie with a wrecked dumb-down population foaming at
[56:53.160 --> 56:57.040]  the mouth begging for tyranny and if you go to the Colosseum in Rome I got a
[56:57.040 --> 57:00.920]  nighttime tour last night they had a lot of powerful footage that's coming out
[57:00.920 --> 57:05.680]  and you think about for 500 years the human sacrifice that's what it was it
[57:05.680 --> 57:09.200]  started with ritualized battle when a rich Roman would die they'd have his
[57:09.200 --> 57:12.960]  slaves kill each other and it built to where sometimes they had thousands of
[57:12.960 --> 57:17.800]  animals a day elephants tigers lions extinct species of bear they
[57:17.800 --> 57:24.600]  extincted scores of species of cats and in large bears and other animals in
[57:24.600 --> 57:30.160]  Europe just supplying the Colosseum that was the television that was the
[57:30.160 --> 57:35.360]  entertainment the bread and the circuses of the day and we all know that we all
[57:35.360 --> 57:38.760]  know it's bread and the circus but this is how you lose your soul when I look
[57:38.760 --> 57:42.640]  out at the Italians or look out at Americans or look out at anybody they
[57:42.640 --> 57:47.440]  have lost their souls to entertainment to pridefulness to self-centered behavior
[57:47.440 --> 57:53.120]  and the world has been stolen from us while this happened but nature abhors a
[57:53.120 --> 57:58.960]  vacuum and we are being judged because now the bottom is falling out and
[57:58.960 --> 58:02.560]  nothing can stop tyranny worldwide because tyranny's got in all the
[58:02.560 --> 58:07.840]  positions of power it's gonna get so bad the world is gonna marvel and it's our
[58:07.840 --> 58:11.640]  job to be there explaining why it happened explaining historically the
[58:11.640 --> 58:16.720]  rules explaining the rules of the system explaining the rules of time
[58:16.720 --> 58:21.680]  explaining why we're in hell why we're losing the prosperity why we're
[58:21.680 --> 58:26.920]  degenerating why we're dying of cancer why people are getting Alzheimer's at 25
[58:26.920 --> 58:32.560]  now they're calling it neurological disorders why we're being basically
[58:32.560 --> 58:38.200]  cursed it's because we have overturned the basic parameters of how
[58:38.200 --> 58:44.160]  civilization operates and works and it doesn't matter how hard the system
[58:44.160 --> 58:49.560]  pushes all of its evil will now be exposed we're gonna go to break most of

[01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:58.120]  say let's put gun owners in forced labor camps for Obama they say yes I'm sick of
[01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:03.400]  gun owners let's put them in slave camps let's get rid of freedom ban the bill
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:09.040]  of rights for Hillary and make her a dictator yes let's do it that latest
[01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:14.040]  video is up on info wars.com I'm gonna retweet it right now we're gonna
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:18.520]  repost at the front page it was up last night and it just again illustrates how
[01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:22.640]  dangerous these people are well of course if they lost the common sense to
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:27.200]  stand up for the unborn they're going to dehumanize everybody else including
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:32.080]  the Bill of Rights and Constitution including their own freedoms because
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:38.400]  they're in this fantasy land literal trance medical trance believing that
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:42.920]  because they support Hillary or because they support Obama that magically
[01:01:42.920 --> 01:01:47.520]  through alchemy then it makes it okay because somehow when they fantasize
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:53.480]  about total dictatorial control that makes them the big mommy now the big
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:57.760]  dictator and you see this to a certain extent when Republicans are in
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:02.800]  supporting tyranny under Bush but under Democrats it takes on a sickening
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:14.880]  rotting stinking oozing you know truly beyond filthy aspect to it that is just
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:20.800]  obscene but of course it's obscene new Planned Parenthood video first they
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:23.960]  denied these were real then they said okay big deal now they're trying to block
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:28.840]  them in court the new fifth Planned Parenthood video on info wars calm I
[01:02:28.840 --> 01:02:35.520]  hope this gets covered later I'm sure it will talking about how it's just a
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:43.480]  matter of line items intact fetal cadavers being delivered close quote
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:49.320]  they ensure we will deliver the entire cadavers and then of course there's new
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:53.320]  evidence coming out that some of these grips keep the babies alive because
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:59.760]  you've got to harvest those organs lovingly or there's a problem and then I
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:04.360]  see people on YouTube going well of course it's valuable organs let's sell
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:10.360]  them oh but see jackass let me talk to those folks you little greedy turds why
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.400]  don't you then get your girlfriend pregnant change the market and make
[01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:17.000]  sure you get 200 grand which is not even half the money that's going to be made
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.760]  off the sale of the intact organs why not raise it to nine months give birth
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:26.760]  to the child like Peter Singer says at Princeton it has no rights and then you
[01:03:26.760 --> 01:03:33.520]  can grow it up and then keep it alive on on stasis keep it alive with breathing
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:39.560]  tubes and a feeding tube and harvest the organs slowly and lovingly then you
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:44.040]  can get up to a million dollars because it's just a baby with no rights and no
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:48.400]  consciousness and no mind because the bioethicis say so and the Watson
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:55.320]  computer and IBM says so then go all the way go all the way please for us and
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:59.200]  let's keep them alive till it's say age five let's say your child's your
[01:03:59.200 --> 01:04:03.000]  property and you can just grow them up till they're five years of age have a
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.080]  blood type that matches some other rich kid and then you can go in to take a
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:12.080]  little Bobby or little Jenny or little Carol or little Fritz in and have them
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.200]  harvested because that's what we become as a society while we cry about using
[01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.760]  the right words and then been getting rid of rebel flags and digging up
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.320]  Confederate generals to feel morally high ground and saying how incredibly
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:33.360]  courageous Caitlyn Jenner is with all the faux liberties meanwhile we have
[01:04:33.360 --> 01:04:38.240]  dehumanized ourselves and all of us now aren't sticking up for each other so we
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:43.360]  are screwed we are in deep trouble and the devil whether you believe that as an
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:49.240]  entity or not is being turned loose to rabidously tear us apart we'll be back
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:54.040]  with the most dumb-down scum you've ever seen
[01:04:58.120 --> 01:05:03.800]  the devil obsessed cult that brought you that huge bronze baphomet statue is now
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:08.200]  funding a huge effort to undermine anti-abortion legislation the satanic
[01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:13.040]  temple says that proceeds from ticket sales from the largest public satanic
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:17.600]  ceremony in history will be used to support the reproductive rights legal
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:22.600]  action fund the cult which clearly aligns itself with the devil even though
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:26.520]  they claim not to believe you really exists has a questionable statement on
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:30.600]  its website suggesting that the reason they support abortion is to do with
[01:05:30.600 --> 01:05:35.880]  personal choice and women's rights not an identification with historical
[01:05:35.880 --> 01:05:40.960]  satanic child sacrifice or you know doing the evil bidding of the dark lord
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.880]  then the satanic temple recently launched a federal lawsuit against the
[01:05:44.880 --> 01:05:48.400]  state of Missouri claiming that the state's laws restricting abortion
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.680]  violate their free exercise of satanism and that abortion is an essential

[01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:13.760]  welcome back to the Alex Jones show I'm David Knight in Austin and joining us
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:20.960]  live from Rome is Alex Jones Alex thank you David yes Alex Jones here
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:25.840]  reporting live from Rome Italy I'm gonna leave you here in a few minutes and then
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:28.920]  David Knight's gonna break down a lot of the latest breaking news and
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:33.920]  information and the situation will dumb down Hillary voters and then towards
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:37.680]  the end of the hour we'll get to a report where I asked the question are we
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:41.960]  going to see the second fall of Rome and of course the mayor and others here have
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:46.440]  said the London independent that they believe the city is collapsing and of
[01:08:46.440 --> 01:08:50.040]  course as the taxes get raised and raised and raised but it's bigger than
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:56.760]  just Rome itself we're talking about Western culture we're talking about the
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:09:01.640]  fact that Rome fell for the very same reasons that we see the globalist system
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:06.040]  failing and that you know the globalists have designed failure into it to
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:11.560]  consolidate control that very system that they've been exacerbating may be their
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:16.680]  downfall as well but regardless the collapse of the new owner system will
[01:09:16.680 --> 01:09:21.120]  be spectacular undoubtedly in fact every major culture and every major
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:27.440]  civilization has always degenerated and fallen we see this throughout the last
[01:09:27.440 --> 01:09:32.520]  6,000 years of recorded history and beyond in the in the deeper older
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:37.800]  archaeological record and now we see this just the time market we see this
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:42.600]  maxed out population the seven and a half billion people with the globalist
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:47.480]  stifling innovation believing that cutting back innovation will stifle
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:52.400]  population growth when even the Royal Commission in 49 found stifling
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:58.680]  industrialization grows populations so you add all the greed and anti-human
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:03.840]  corruption of the Malthusian eugenicists that run the planet into our real
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:09.200]  problems some of which they didn't cause it is a perfect storm so I know David's
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:13.560]  going to be talking about this latest mark dice report after I leave and then
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:18.880]  he's welcome to get into so I know he's an expert on that on the degeneration of
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.160]  civilization and culture and of course your phone calls and more today and then
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:28.280]  there are some special guests joining us here in the third hour I will be filing
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:33.600]  a whole bunch of special reports now you've already seen many of them at
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:38.280]  info wars.com and on the nightly news but we're going to be focusing now on the
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:46.360]  Vatican itself Wednesday Thursday Friday and then I come back Saturday so we're
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:52.320]  going to be really focusing on the Vatican big time because the Vatican is
[01:10:52.320 --> 01:10:58.720]  becoming a publicly global political system it pretty much always has been
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.840]  to a certain extent but there's been different agendas from the church I'm
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:06.120]  not a Catholic but I studied it it's part of history it's very interesting I
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:11.880]  like Catholics on on on average found to be very upright good hard-working pro
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:17.000]  family anti-communist people so I follow Christ lead I judge a tree by its
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:24.320]  fruits the new Catholic Church blackmailed over globalist infiltration
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:29.000]  with the pedophile rings will not speak out against the forced abortion
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.480]  garbage that's being funded by the UN they will not speak out against Planned
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:37.400]  Parenthood a Nazi eugenicist most proto-nazi and help give birth to Nazi
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:44.320]  so that's not fair mother of the Nazis organization they they only push
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:48.720]  socialism communism carbon taxes every globalist fraud centralization of power
[01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:54.120]  with this smiling pope they call papa and they've got indulgences to him
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:59.320]  everywhere here in Rome it's it's it's it's truly disgusting and there he is
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:06.480]  sounding like like like Margaret Sanger meets Fidel Castro and we're supposed to
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:10.720]  fall down on our faces when what's coming out of him is just just just
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:15.480]  unbelievable and of course even the Associated Press reported and the hill
[01:12:15.480 --> 01:12:20.160]  as well that his approval ratings are the lowest for any pope basically ever
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:25.320]  in the United States now as people discovered who he was as people
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:29.920]  discovered what he is pushing but to the impoverished dumbed-down Third World
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:34.240]  masses it is the second coming of Christ and so he's here to help bring in the
[01:12:34.240 --> 01:12:39.640]  world government just as Obama is it's just another sign this is the big push
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:44.200]  and so David's gonna be breaking that down but we're gonna be here we're
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:50.280]  going to be in-depth investigating we're going to be going into the Vatican
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.600]  we're going to be talking to experts we're going to be really intensely
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:59.040]  working the next three and a half four days before we return to the United
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:05.000]  States the former United States now under the transatlantic treaty now part
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  of the world government but you could only have a pope getting away with not
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.880]  attacking abortion when he first got in a few years ago he said Catholics
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:18.480]  obsess on abortion too much they're too focused and when I saw that I said whoa
[01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.520]  something's going on when I saw the mainstream media that normally attack
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:25.600]  Catholics saying how great he was I said whoa we're in deep trouble danger
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:30.600]  danger will Robinson so so we see the Catholic Church going from saying have
[01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:35.800]  kids to saying don't have kids abort him or or saying nothing about it going
[01:13:35.800 --> 01:13:41.200]  from communism's bad to communism's good carbon taxes or a death sentence over
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:44.520]  the next few decades over a billion people Lord Moncton's own numbers show
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:50.080]  and this can only be done with an incredibly dumbed-down population so
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.400]  David I'm gonna hand the baton to you here in a moment to play this Mark
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:58.920]  Dice latest video because I speak hatefully of these people because they're
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:04.520]  well-spoken they're cognizant they are licking their lips with enjoyment to
[01:14:04.520 --> 01:14:08.440]  Mark Dice saying we want to get rid of freedom we want to get rid of the
[01:14:08.440 --> 01:14:13.040]  Bill of Rights for Hillary to get out of her way so we're told a woman would run
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.080]  things differently yeah like Queen Elizabeth II I mean it is just just
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:23.560]  another cliche and they're so engrossed on a power trip of reflected glory
[01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:28.360]  imagine they're gonna get all this power by putting a woman in there and all
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:32.200]  these free goodies that they're openly embracing tyranny this shows these
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:37.800]  people aren't laughing stock always here oh environmentalist wackos are always
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:41.920]  here oh you know these dumb idiots want to ban the word you know or paper bags
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:46.400]  brown paper bags or this makes no sense ban the name mother and father look with
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:51.720]  the nuts have done next that's not nuts that's what some hail bop space cult
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:56.360]  would do this is a hardcore cult and I know you know that audience we've got
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.080]  to really get serious with these people and just say look your freak cult
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:05.240]  members totalitarian scum that live off the government the people you're an
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:09.800]  abomination the Republican leadership it can't even defund partial birth
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:13.520]  abortion that's taxpayer funded all over the country you can't do anything
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.240]  banners a worthless piece of garbage it's a joke he's even in power thank God
[01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:21.200]  they're looking at recalling that maggot and that's why they want to bring into
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.680]  totalitarianism we're gonna skip this network break that's why they want to
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:29.000]  bring into totalitarianism so David that's time to comment and play the
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.840]  video is because they know that we're gonna peacefully take the system back
[01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:38.560]  and we're gonna intellectually not I mean we're like selling snow cones in
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:42.920]  hell here hey we shouldn't have farm banks be tax exempt rigging everything we
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.360]  shouldn't be selling baby parts there shouldn't be mobile execution bans in
[01:15:46.360 --> 01:15:49.720]  China killing political dissidents they shouldn't be putting fluoride in the
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:53.120]  water that Harvard admits lowers your IQ and gives you cancer here's their
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:55.720]  documents admitting they're killing us there shouldn't be a force in
[01:15:55.720 --> 01:15:59.360]  oculation the president shouldn't be breaking in every day take over my
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:04.840]  cell phone with directives and orders and EAS alerts this is a freak show it's
[01:16:04.840 --> 01:16:09.400]  a joke it's out of control the people running this need to come back to earth
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:13.800]  so I salute the hackers who are infiltrating these organizations and
[01:16:13.800 --> 01:16:18.400]  exposing their crimes I salute the people the true journalist going in and
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:23.240]  showing the macabre baby sales I salute everyone that's what this is about the
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:28.200]  stuff James O'Keefe's done the stuff info wars does the stuff we all do we
[01:16:28.200 --> 01:16:32.920]  aren't perfect we don't claim to all of all the answers but we don't love death
[01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:38.040]  we don't love lies we don't love fraud we don't sit around and go yeah let's
[01:16:38.040 --> 01:16:44.320]  get rid of the Bill of Rights I mean we want sanity we want prosperity we want
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:48.320]  justice we want to be good parents we want to build a good world we want
[01:16:48.320 --> 01:16:52.720]  space stations we want undersea stations we want deep mining we want

[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.000]  we want all of God's promises that we've been given so far you look at how the
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.880]  Romans 2,000 plus years ago could build buildings they can't even hardly build
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:09.920]  today you look at what humans can do with the music of Beethoven and the
[01:17:09.920 --> 01:17:15.160]  poetry of all these great people and you look at what civilization has built
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:19.760]  together and how wonderful humanity is I'm sick of the ugliest dumbest
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:25.680]  spiritually most corrupt wicked demons squatting on top humanity threatened by
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:30.080]  God's free will he's given us and trying to destroy free will and calling it
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:37.000]  liberal it's not liberal trying to force us to embrace all your forms of
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:42.680]  slavery and death we reject your culture of death we reject your fraud we the
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:48.640]  poison you put in us we vomit it out we crap it out we sweat it out we're done
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:53.240]  we're free the sun is rising the beginning of humanity awakening is
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:59.080]  happening just as pure evil rises at the same time tectonic forces make sure you
[01:17:59.080 --> 01:18:03.400]  pick the right side powerful reports coming up David Knight I'm gonna hand
[01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:07.360]  the baton to you and the rest of the info wars operation but I want to salute
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:13.680]  the listeners for making this entire operation possible thank you Alex thank
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:20.120]  you Alex Alex Jones reporting live from Rome and we just had his reports we're
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:23.480]  gonna have another report coming up at the bottom of the hour and as Alex was
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:26.520]  pointing out we had this report from Mark Dice talking to people in
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:31.480]  California about the Bill of Rights it was picked up by Drudge and yesterday I
[01:18:31.480 --> 01:18:36.160]  talked about Norman Lear 93 years old talking to television critics and saying
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.440]  when I was a child I knew that there were people who wanted to kill me because
[01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:45.120]  I was Jewish but I had this Bill of Rights this declaration of independence I
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:50.280]  knew that protected me that kept me safe because I was taught that in civics
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:56.040]  class not being taught today and of course he knows that as well as we know
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:01.960]  that look at these adults as Mark Dice asked them if they'll repeal the Bill
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:07.440]  of Rights for Hillary Clinton one of Hillary Clinton's primary campaign
[01:19:07.440 --> 01:19:12.760]  promises is to repeal the Bill of Rights to help with the New World Order you
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.800]  think it's time we get behind her and support the repeal I think it is I
[01:19:17.800 --> 01:19:22.560]  think we need change like they've been promising us for so many years I think
[01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:27.520]  it's time to get behind Hillary Clinton and do support her repeal her yes I
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:31.840]  really do they're just too old I think 200 years you can't you can't have the
[01:19:31.840 --> 01:19:37.000]  the rules of yesteryear now those freedoms are just so outdated it's so
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:41.840]  much has changed so much has changed people have changed there's just we're
[01:19:41.840 --> 01:19:45.680]  living a different world now checking to see if the Hillary Clinton supporters
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:50.960]  support the plan to repeal the bill I support it I support it I sure do thank
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:56.600]  you her plan to repeal the Bill of Rights about time we do that for her I
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:19:59.760]  think it's a good time to look at it for sure time to look at repealing the
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.800]  Bill of Rights for Hillary time to look at it Hillary Clinton's primary campaign
[01:20:03.800 --> 01:20:08.600]  platform is to repeal the Bill of Rights to move America forward do you think
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:12.960]  that's a good campaign promise do you think that we should get behind her
[01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:16.920]  regardless of what political party you're with to support the repeal of the
[01:20:16.920 --> 01:20:24.040]  Bill of Rights I do I think so obviously you're here I'm stuck in between
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:28.360]  I'm a little Democrat and I'm a little Republican I I'm not the extreme of
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:32.600]  either or so but you do support Hillary Clinton I do and so you support the plan
[01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:37.800]  to repeal the Bill of Rights her big promise to move America forward yes just
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:41.200]  checking we're just interviewing Hillary Clinton supporters to see if they
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:45.840]  agree with her primary campaign platform of repealing the Bill of Rights so that
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:52.080]  you do support that I do all right thank you very much you're welcome one of
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:56.960]  Hillary's primary campaign promises is to repeal the Bill of Rights to help out
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:21:00.360]  with the New World Order do you think it's time we should we get over by
[01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:04.600]  partisan differences and support Hillary Clinton's plan to repeal the Bill of
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:09.520]  Rights I don't say I'm not sure I haven't been following lately you think
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:13.240]  Hillary Clinton has the right idea to repeal the Bill of Rights to help with
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:19.360]  the New World Order possibly you think it's time maybe we support that yeah
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:24.520]  might as well let everyone do a little bit too old I guess somewhat outdated one
[01:21:24.520 --> 01:21:28.760]  of Hillary Clinton's primary campaign promises is to repeal the Bill of Rights
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:33.560]  to help progress the New World Order you think it's time we get on board with her
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:42.000]  and repeal the Bill of Rights to help America progress sure I do I have nothing
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.440]  more to say nothing more to say I don't talk politics ask her see what she said
[01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:50.040]  what do you think about Hillary's campaign to repeal the Bill of Rights do
[01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:57.320]  you think it's time we do that to progress society forward yeah yeah I think so
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:01.640]  you think it's time to get over partisan differences and support Hillary
[01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:07.960]  Clinton's plan to repeal the Bill of Rights I don't know I really don't have
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:11.920]  an opinion with it could be good it could be bad you're just not sure yeah
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:16.600]  could kind of go both ways depending on what exactly they're doing repealing the
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:23.920]  Bill of Rights could be good or it could be bad yes I know I'm in the middle yeah
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:29.200]  you probably saw one of Hillary Clinton's primary campaign promises is to
[01:22:29.200 --> 01:22:34.040]  repeal the Bill of Rights I think it's time we continue with the progressive
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:40.200]  agenda and support Hillary's campaign to repeal the Bill of Rights well you know
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:47.480]  what I absolutely think I have an orthodox way of thinking when it comes to
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:54.000]  politics and I agree with a lot of Hillary's policies and I do agree with
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:59.200]  repealing the Bill of Rights not entirely but some of it does need to be
[01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:05.360]  repealed but I'm a pro-black person so I come from an aspect of political aspect
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:11.520]  that relies on justice and the Bill of Rights people and some of the Bill of
[01:23:11.520 --> 01:23:16.640]  Rights should be repealed and restructured which one's specifically
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:22.960]  well I'll tell you specifically I'd have to recall it through research but the
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:28.840]  ones that are relating to just injustices to the blacks a lot of them
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:34.560]  they say they they offer they offer assistance to blacks in certain ways in
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:38.240]  the political aspect but they don't so the Bill of Rights are the Bill of Rights
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:41.520]  are a little racist is what you're saying not necessarily racist they're just
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:47.760]  unjust so Bill of Rights are unjust yes some of them not all maybe 50% of them
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:51.840]  no I would say probably a third a third of the Bill of Rights but this is just
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:55.680]  coming from a guess you know from yeah actually having more research on the
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:59.480]  little research and could get more particular but okay yeah that's an
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:05.600]  honest opinion about the Bill of Rights there you go that's a demonstration
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:09.320]  of what Norman Lear was talking about about how the Bill of Rights is not
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:13.200]  taught in civics class instead what they do is they talk about white privilege so
[01:24:13.200 --> 01:24:17.520]  he thinks that there's something in there that protects individual rights that
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:21.840]  is racist you see what he doesn't understand is the things that we've
[01:24:21.840 --> 01:24:25.960]  seen with police brutality those things would not be happening if the Bill of
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:29.840]  Rights were being enforced and not violated but of course it's not just
[01:24:29.840 --> 01:24:33.280]  Hillary Clinton it's Republicans as well Hillary Hillary would repeal the
[01:24:33.280 --> 01:24:36.760]  Second Amendment as would most Democrats and as that man was saying well
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.120]  let's just go in there selectively take things out here and there you know
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:44.480]  because Marco Rubio he would repeal the Fourth Amendment about searches and
[01:24:44.480 --> 01:24:47.680]  seizures because the NSA wants to look at what you're doing of course Lindsey
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.640]  Graham has said in contrast to the Sixth Amendment shut up you don't get a
[01:24:51.640 --> 01:24:56.280]  lawyer okay well shut up Lindsey you don't get nominated for president you
[01:24:56.280 --> 01:25:00.120]  shouldn't even be a senator so yeah they would all take bits and pieces of
[01:25:00.120 --> 01:25:05.520]  this look the war on drugs and the war on terror themselves are ripping the
[01:25:05.520 --> 01:25:10.120]  Bill of Rights apart and have repealed the Constitution and the rule of law so
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:15.240]  it's not a hypothetical folks they're willing to do this because they're
[01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:20.720]  blindly loyal to a politician or they're blindly loyal to a party or they're
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:26.880]  blindly loyal to this failed idea of a war on terror or a war on drugs they
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:32.080]  get behind these concepts and they will rip apart the rule of law destroying
[01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:35.400]  everything going all the way back to the Magna Carta the idea that we should be
[01:25:35.400 --> 01:25:40.560]  presumed innocent until we are found guilty that we would not have an
[01:25:40.560 --> 01:25:46.000]  ordinate crime a punishment put against us that we would be we have some real
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.360]  right to privacy not just the right to privacy in terms of killing your children
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:53.320]  that's not a real right to privacy they don't fundamentally believe any of that
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.680]  they don't believe we should have a choice about anything either the same
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:26:01.320]  people who say that they're championing championing pro-choice or the same ones
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:07.360]  who want to force vaccines on us they want to take away our informed consent so
[01:26:07.360 --> 01:26:11.200]  yeah that's the world that we live in here in America the world where people
[01:26:11.200 --> 01:26:15.880]  don't even know what the Bill of Rights are about they have absolutely no
[01:26:15.880 --> 01:26:21.760]  concept of it but they are blindly loyal to individuals they're blindly loyal to
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:25.880]  failed policies that we have followed for decades that are not getting us
[01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:29.280]  anywhere one of the things we talk about when we get to the debate is an
[01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:34.320]  amazing admission and a reversal from Chris Christie apparently on the war of
[01:26:34.320 --> 01:26:38.720]  drugs I've never seen anything like this before from Chris Christie he was just a
[01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:43.800]  few days ago talking about how he's going to stop the decriminalization of
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.600]  marijuana in Colorado and elsewhere and as one person said how in the world is
[01:26:48.600 --> 01:26:52.400]  he going to do that I tweeted back and I said well maybe he will close the lanes
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:56.280]  on the bridges and bring them to their knees but now he's saying a different
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:00.280]  tune before we go to break I want to let you know that we have a special at

[01:28:15.200 --> 01:28:20.240]  out they're stocking the stores for Christmas already in its August and so
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:24.240]  maybe you should think about your while you can get free shipping getting some
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:29.520]  gifts for Christmas now in terms of some of the ways that this country is
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:34.000]  evolving I saw this report a couple of days ago and hadn't reported on it yet
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.800]  there's been so much news happening this is a report from countercurrent news a
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:42.800]  police department in Massachusetts is admitting that they only hire applicants
[01:28:42.800 --> 01:28:46.880]  who promise that they would not arrest other cops how's that how's that for not
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:50.800]  only corruption but violating your rights because that's the way that they've
[01:28:50.800 --> 01:28:53.760]  been trained we're not trained to know what our rights are we're not trained to
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.960]  we're trained to think that maybe you know a third of the Bill of Rights are
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:01.120]  racist because just our country is just racist in general that's what he was
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:04.560]  taught when he went to school when he went to the government school they
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:06.880]  didn't teach him about the Bill of Rights they didn't teach him about
[01:29:06.880 --> 01:29:10.280]  individual rights they just told him that he was a put-upon minority but of
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:14.720]  course then there's another minority the men in blue who are going to stand up
[01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:18.800]  for their own rights and this group of people is not going to arrest each other
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:22.160]  they say the Massachusetts Civil Service Commission officials wrote in an
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:26.240]  official investigation they were just disappointed to discover that the city
[01:29:26.240 --> 01:29:30.040]  of Methuen gave higher ranking points to candidates who said they would never
[01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:35.320]  arrest a fellow cop for drunk driving and they docked applicants if they said
[01:29:35.320 --> 01:29:40.240]  they would arrest a cop for violating the law how's that stay with us we'll be
[01:29:40.240 --> 01:29:44.880]  right back with Alex Jones's report the second fall of Rome
[01:29:47.400 --> 01:29:56.920]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:29:58.800 --> 01:30:04.400]  keyboard tough guys flex their imaginary muscles as they use the PlayStation 4 in
[01:30:04.400 --> 01:30:08.720]  their mother's basement to step into the digital octagon with Rowdy Rhonda
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:13.880]  Rousey in the wake of a knockout performance at UFC 190 social justice
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:18.080]  warriors just couldn't take hearing any more about Rousey being a strong female
[01:30:18.080 --> 01:30:23.440]  role model they attacked Rousey over the internet for her past comments regarding
[01:30:23.440 --> 01:30:28.200]  transgender MMA fighter Fallon Fox calling the rowdy one a transphobic
[01:30:28.200 --> 01:30:33.120]  Rousey said in regards to Fox she can try hormones chop her pecker off but it's
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:37.440]  still the same bone structure a man has it's an advantage and I don't think it's
[01:30:37.440 --> 01:30:42.000]  fair upon hearing this the digital dominators put up their two hands only
[01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:45.960]  to use their two thumbs and win a full five rounds with Rhonda on Twitter
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:50.960]  saying things like Rhonda Rousey thinks trans women are men how dare you speak

[01:33:30.840 --> 01:33:41.280]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:46.720]  Alex Jones here reporting from the capital city of Italy, Rome.
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:51.200]  This ancient city is so incredibly important to understand what's happening in modern times
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:57.800]  because much of our political culture, but also economic culture, came out of the city
[01:33:57.800 --> 01:34:04.240]  of Rome that had the largest world empire in history up until that time except for Alexander
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:05.440]  the Great.
[01:34:05.440 --> 01:34:11.120]  And the Romans themselves had modeled much of what they did off of the Macedonian known
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:17.040]  world conqueror that came, of course, hundreds of years before the legend of Romulus and
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:23.120]  Remus, a suckling from a she-wolf here at the center of the Seven Hills.
[01:34:23.120 --> 01:34:30.840]  What we do know is it was the Treaty of Rome in the late 1950s that founded the covert
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:36.480]  European Union that is now destroying what's left of national sovereignty and individual
[01:34:36.480 --> 01:34:37.480]  freedom.
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:43.840]  We have seen the private central banks install presidents in Italy and presidents and leaders
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:49.960]  in places like Greece, truly unprecedented, and as we watched the world economic collapse
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:55.840]  be engineered, Info Wars knew that it was key to travel to Spain, Italy and other countries
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:00.000]  to see for ourselves exactly what is happening.
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:04.480]  We're producing a documentary out of this trip that will air in about a month or so
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:06.200]  on Info Wars Nightly News.
[01:35:06.200 --> 01:35:10.680]  Rob Do, Info Wars Nightly News Director, is here with us helping run camera.
[01:35:10.680 --> 01:35:17.480]  So is Buckley Hammond and, of course, myself, but you've got to get on the ground to experience
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:18.480]  it for yourself.
[01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:22.320]  Being in Spain, there were more foreigners than there were Spanish.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:26.200]  There's just flotillas coming in from North Africa on a daily basis.
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:31.680]  Same thing with Italy, just literally hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants a year
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:37.280]  as Africa collapses, as the Middle East collapses, and much of that is because of Western policies
[01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:41.480]  that are deliberately destabilizing Africa and the Middle East so they can be more easily
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:47.400]  controlled for their raw resources, and then the people of the West end up paying for it
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:49.760]  when these immigrant populations come in.
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:54.040]  The globalists then put them on welfare and use them as a new political tool, giving them
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:36:01.520]  voting rights in many cases to then basically be an outside political force to checkmate
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:07.040]  any action to kick out the globalists that have economically conquered these countries.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:13.080]  So here we are in the birthplace of what has become fascism worldwide.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:18.480]  Here we are in Rome, and some of the leaders of Italy, and, of course, the mayor of Rome
[01:36:18.480 --> 01:36:22.560]  and others have said recently in the London Telegraph that they believe the city is on
[01:36:22.560 --> 01:36:23.560]  the verge of collapse.
[01:36:23.560 --> 01:36:29.120]  So we're going to be out investigating to see how serious the depression in Europe is.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:33.680]  We're also going to be seeing if the unemployment is as bad as they say, upwards of 30%.
[01:36:33.680 --> 01:36:36.480]  It was 40% in Spain.
[01:36:36.480 --> 01:36:39.560]  We were in the Catalan area.
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:44.960]  We were in Barcelona, the wealthiest city in Spain, but still talking to the people
[01:36:44.960 --> 01:36:45.960]  off record.
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:49.320]  They were scared and said that things were not as good as it used to be, and that was
[01:36:49.320 --> 01:36:54.680]  in the most wealthy sector of Spain that's been trying unsuccessfully to secede.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:36:58.520]  We saw literally tens of thousands that were just on almost every doorstep and hanging off
[01:36:58.520 --> 01:37:05.920]  every balcony of secession flags for the Catalonians wanting to leave Spain.
[01:37:05.920 --> 01:37:09.960]  We know there's all sorts of moves in Italy trying to get out from underneath the European
[01:37:09.960 --> 01:37:10.960]  Union.
[01:37:10.960 --> 01:37:16.600]  That's why they're trying to use this crisis to bring in even more EU control and dissolve
[01:37:16.600 --> 01:37:20.800]  what local, regional, national sovereignty was left.
[01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:27.760]  So there's no check or no balance, no separation of powers like we have in the United States
[01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:30.920]  on the EU dictatorship that has been set up.
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:35.360]  But here we are, the place where Julius Caesar was stabbed to death after he brought his
[01:37:35.360 --> 01:37:40.080]  troops in from the north, crossing the Rubicon, becoming a dictator.
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:46.320]  Here we are in the place where Mussolini, the fascist leader, was hung up by his legs and
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:48.560]  basically spit on by tens of thousands.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:52.600]  Here we are in the capital city of Italy.
[01:37:52.600 --> 01:37:58.200]  So much of the fight for the globalist takeover is taking place.
[01:37:58.200 --> 01:38:00.800]  And we're going to be doing now the street interviews.
[01:38:00.800 --> 01:38:03.000]  We're going to be also traveling.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:10.440]  I'm going to sit on a map, a random small town to go to in Italy separate from Rome
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:13.520]  itself to try to get a flavor of just exactly what's happening there.
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:18.680]  And so many people who are ignorant politically, not really our audience, but folks I see on
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:22.280]  YouTube, people commenting on Info Wars say, you know, why do we care about Europe?
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:24.720]  Well, that's like saying, why do you care of the stock market crashes?
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:25.960]  Well, I don't own stock.
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:26.960]  I don't care.
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:31.320]  Well, if the stock market crashes and most businesses all crash, then you'll be laid
[01:38:31.320 --> 01:38:35.960]  off, or if you own your own shop or business, people won't have money to come in and buy
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:36.960]  from it.
[01:38:36.960 --> 01:38:40.200]  I mean, I know real business owners, people in the real economy know this, but so many
[01:38:40.200 --> 01:38:44.000]  smart mouths out there say, why do we care if China collapses with the stock market?
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:46.320]  Why do we care if Europe collapses?
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:51.040]  There's, you know, there's kind of this sick idea that I've seen out there that when somebody
[01:38:51.040 --> 01:38:53.640]  else does bad, we do good.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:58.040]  No, no, that's not how trade works, especially when we've been globalized.
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:39:05.720]  When, when another nation does bad, we do bad as well, and that's what Ron Paul always
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:06.720]  talks about.
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.400]  It's time to stop fighting.
[01:39:08.400 --> 01:39:13.280]  It's time to stop having this wartime-based economy and get onto a free market economy.
[01:39:13.280 --> 01:39:14.920]  But the globalists don't want that.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:24.360]  They're on record wanting managed crony economies where they control who gets the business, they
[01:39:24.360 --> 01:39:25.920]  control who gets the contracts.
[01:39:25.920 --> 01:39:32.280]  And look, I know the general audience of InfoWars, the nightly news, the radio show, the films,
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:34.200]  the readers of InfoWars.com.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:39.240]  I know you already know all this, but we need to get the word out to the general public
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.440]  because they're starting to wake up if there's a problem.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:45.160]  They don't know what the solution is, and they're being sold that socialism and more
[01:39:45.160 --> 01:39:48.720]  collectivism and more wealth redistribution is the answer.
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:53.680]  Not understanding the ultra, ultra, ultra rich are tax-exempt, basically, and have diplomatic
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:58.400]  community, and they're the ones lobbying to raise taxes on the working person and on
[01:39:58.400 --> 01:40:04.880]  the middle class and on the new rich who create the economy that allows there to be a renaissance
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:06.680]  of ideas.
[01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:12.400]  The globalists are against economies, period, that are diverse because it allows choice and
[01:40:12.400 --> 01:40:17.920]  voting with your euros, voting with your dollars, voting culturally for the products and ideas
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:23.240]  and beliefs you believe in by your free association doesn't allow them to run the world.
[01:40:23.240 --> 01:40:25.360]  And these people are control freaks.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:30.920]  They want to dominate all these cultures and all these peoples and erase any form of national
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:32.080]  sovereignty.
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:37.240]  They're even trying to get rid of the national teams of Italy and Germany and England and
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:43.920]  others saying that it's too nationalistic and just have them have, you know, like superhero
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:50.840]  names or things like that, like we have in the United States, because they don't want
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:55.520]  there to be any idea that there were ever any independent systems.
[01:40:55.520 --> 01:41:00.520]  And look, none of these countries are perfect, but when you get far removed, imperial, unelected
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:03.000]  governments, you've really got a big problem on your hands.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.920]  So epic things are happening, being in the city of Rome itself, coming into the airport.
[01:41:08.920 --> 01:41:14.680]  Again, I see more people who aren't from this country than are from this country.
[01:41:14.680 --> 01:41:19.720]  Italians had the lowest birth rate in Europe, 1.2, 1.3 children for every two adults.
[01:41:19.720 --> 01:41:26.120]  Italy is dying, the West is dying, and look, it's almost racist, they say, to even want
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:27.720]  to have a Western culture.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:30.080]  I don't want any culture to die.
[01:41:30.080 --> 01:41:31.640]  The Japanese have a low birth rate.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:34.800]  I'm not Japanese, but they have a 1.3 birth rate.
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:36.960]  I'm very sad that their culture is dying.
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.640]  And it's okay to have Japanese.
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.160]  It's okay to have Italians.
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:43.000]  It's okay to have Germans and Russians and South Africans.
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:44.520]  It's okay to have Mexicans.
[01:41:44.520 --> 01:41:46.520]  It's okay to have your culture.
[01:41:46.520 --> 01:41:48.400]  It's okay that you're special.
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:52.000]  If you choose to mix with other cultures, if you choose to be part of that, that's your
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  right as well.
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  That's beautiful.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.320]  But globalism erases all original indigenous culture because it's based on family, on honor,
[01:41:59.320 --> 01:42:04.880]  on private property, compared to their plastic, synthetic culture of death.
[01:42:04.880 --> 01:42:06.320]  And that's what we're here exposing.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.160]  And you notice we're having victories against Planned Parenthood, victories against ISIS
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:12.080]  being Western run.
[01:42:12.080 --> 01:42:16.400]  Humanity is waking up, but if humanity would just realize the power that they have, if
[01:42:16.400 --> 01:42:21.080]  you would realize that, and I know you do, but if you really realize it and got others
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:26.400]  to realize it, these tyrants would vanish like phantoms at dawn to paraphrase Thomas
[01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:27.400]  Jefferson.
[01:42:27.400 --> 01:42:33.560]  So a ton of reports coming up from this incredibly historic city of Rome, we'll be breaking it
[01:42:33.560 --> 01:42:34.560]  all down.
[01:42:34.560 --> 01:42:35.560]  Spain was amazing.
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:36.560]  The UK is amazing.
[01:42:36.560 --> 01:42:37.920]  I've never been to Italy.
[01:42:37.920 --> 01:42:39.080]  This blows it all away.
[01:42:39.080 --> 01:42:41.640]  The vibe in Rome is really interesting.
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:46.000]  I'm told the Colosseum has a really bad vibe from people that have been to it.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:47.520]  We're going to be going there and reporting.
[01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.520]  It's all coming up infowars.com.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:54.440]  Again, we're producing a documentary that will be out very, very soon for PrismPlanet.tv
[01:42:54.440 --> 01:42:55.440]  viewers.
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:59.440]  I'm going to throw this back to David Knight co-hosting live from Austin, Texas from the
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:04.640]  Info Wars Command Center, the house that you, the people built.
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:05.640]  You are the resistance.
[01:43:05.640 --> 01:43:08.640]  And that's how it shows reporting from Rome.
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:11.720]  And of course, he's not the only one with his eyes on Europe.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:17.640]  The US government is spying on EU companies in order to control European industries.
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:19.360]  Of course, that's what they're doing.
[01:43:19.360 --> 01:43:20.960]  That's why the Europeans are so upset.
[01:43:20.960 --> 01:43:24.760]  It's not that they're not spying on the Germans because they think that the Germans are a
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:26.040]  threat to the United States.
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:31.480]  They're spying on them because this is part of corporate espionage as part of the crony
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:32.880]  capitalism that's involved.
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:37.160]  They say the NSA's focus remains economic espionage, not international terror.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:39.840]  This is an article up on infowars.com.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:42.280]  Data collection is only a small part of the NSA's intelligence task.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:47.080]  They say the main goal of the US intelligence agencies is to control politicians and managers
[01:43:47.080 --> 01:43:48.080]  in Europe.
[01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:53.400]  It says, the former head of the Austrian federal office for the protection of the Constitution,
[01:43:53.400 --> 01:43:56.600]  they actually want to protect their Constitution in Germany.
[01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:58.400]  The guy's name is Gerd Polly.
[01:43:58.400 --> 01:43:59.920]  He said that in an interview.
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:04.080]  He said, US espionage activities are designed to reinforce American interest to control
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:05.720]  European politicians.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:11.160]  He said, it's no longer about national security as it was before 9-11, but it's become economic
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:15.680]  and industrial espionage against Europe.
[01:44:15.680 --> 01:44:20.280]  They understand what this is about, and let's take a look at the newest example of this.
[01:44:20.280 --> 01:44:24.760]  This is Windows 10, incredibly intrusive, that spies on you by default.
[01:44:24.760 --> 01:44:26.520]  What's going to be done with that information?
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:34.040]  Of course, our government is trying to legalize and give legal immunity to the corporations
[01:44:34.040 --> 01:44:36.520]  to turn that information over to them.
[01:44:36.520 --> 01:44:38.360]  They call that intelligence sharing.
[01:44:38.360 --> 01:44:40.800]  That's what the several versions of CISPO were about.
[01:44:40.800 --> 01:44:43.280]  And of course, they now have CISA.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:46.760]  They've taken the P out because they don't want you to think about the fact that this
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:51.800]  is protecting the corporations from spying on you, from spying on other corporations.
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:53.560]  It's about corporate espionage.
[01:44:53.560 --> 01:44:57.880]  They say Microsoft's new Windows 10 operating system is immensely popular with 14 million
[01:44:57.880 --> 01:44:59.760]  downloads in just two days.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:03.080]  The price of the free upgrade, however, may just be your privacy.
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:04.680]  This is RT reporting.
[01:45:04.680 --> 01:45:10.400]  Changing Windows 10's intrusive default settings is very difficult, as it is very difficult
[01:45:10.400 --> 01:45:15.200]  to change the default settings of government.
[01:45:15.200 --> 01:45:18.120]  Government's default setting is tyranny.
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:21.080]  Government's default setting is to control you.
[01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:22.840]  The founders of this country understood that.
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:27.360]  That's why they put in the Bill of Rights, because they knew that governments always
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:33.040]  default to tyranny, just like Windows 10 defaults to spying on you.
[01:45:33.040 --> 01:45:35.640]  And of course, one of the things that you have to do is what you have to do to stop
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:37.720]  it from spying on you.
[01:45:37.720 --> 01:45:41.840]  Tech bloggers have warned that privacy settings in Windows 10 are invasive by default, that
[01:45:41.840 --> 01:45:46.440]  changing them involves over a dozen different screens and external websites.
[01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.440]  And you know what?
[01:45:47.440 --> 01:45:53.600]  It's going to require us to get involved externally to Washington in order to stop this default
[01:45:53.600 --> 01:45:56.720]  tyranny that has developed.
[01:45:56.720 --> 01:45:57.720]  Is that going to happen?
[01:45:57.720 --> 01:46:01.360]  Are we going to be totally focused on the presidential horse race?
[01:46:01.360 --> 01:46:02.360]  Yes.
[01:46:02.360 --> 01:46:04.360]  It's going to happen yesterday.
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:12.280]  I got the horse right here.
[01:46:12.280 --> 01:46:13.800]  The name is Paul Revere.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:17.760]  And here's a guy that says if the web is clear, can do.
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:18.760]  Yeah.
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:21.920]  They're all giving us the odds on who's going to win.
[01:46:21.920 --> 01:46:24.200]  Which horse is the Paul Revere horse?
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:29.200]  Well, unfortunately, there's not really many horses out there that are sounding the alarm
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:30.480]  about government tyranny.
[01:46:30.480 --> 01:46:34.200]  But actually, I think there is one horse that is a Paul Revere horse.
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:37.880]  Look at this article back in May 28th where they're focusing on the horse race aspect
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:38.880]  of it, of course.
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:39.880]  Who's the most popular?
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:43.400]  And I think it's very interesting to go back and take a look at this because this was only
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:44.400]  about two months ago.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:48.440]  It was the end, it was the very beginning of June or end of May, we were at the beginning
[01:46:48.440 --> 01:46:49.440]  of August.
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:56.000]  Two months ago, Bush 10%, Carson 10%, Huckabee 10%, Rubio 10%, Walker 10%, Cruz 6%, Trump
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:47:03.120]  5%, Christie 4%, did you hear that, Trump 5%, did you notice that Rand Paul isn't anywhere
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:04.120]  in there?
[01:47:04.120 --> 01:47:05.120]  Isn't that interesting?
[01:47:05.120 --> 01:47:09.040]  Well, you know, of course, that's because when Fox News put it up, even though Rand Paul
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:16.680]  polled at 7% ahead of Cruz's 6%, ahead of Trump's 5%, he was totally omitted.
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:21.280]  And then, of course, when MSNBC covered the same Quinnipiac poll, they included the top
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:28.080]  seven performers cutting off the graphic after Cruz and not showing Rand Paul there either.
[01:47:28.080 --> 01:47:31.600]  Instead of leaving Paul off their coverage, MSNBC decided not to show the candidates with
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:34.480]  substantially lower polling scores, okay?
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:38.480]  So look at this, look at the horse race, look at how much things have changed since then.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:43.120]  For all the people who think that this thing is over before it's begun, it isn't.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:46.400]  But there is a massive amount of handicapping.
[01:47:46.400 --> 01:47:49.160]  Just like you heard those guys, they're going to go back and they're going to talk, well,
[01:47:49.160 --> 01:47:50.480]  I think this horse here can do it.
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:51.960]  I think that horse can do it.
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:53.680]  That's what this coverage is about.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:57.560]  They're not talking about issues, they're not going to compare, they're not going to contrast
[01:47:57.560 --> 01:47:58.560]  issues.
[01:47:58.560 --> 01:47:59.560]  You know what?
[01:47:59.560 --> 01:48:03.160]  Most of these horses are saying exactly the same thing, but here's what the Paul Revere
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:04.160]  horse says.
[01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:09.280]  Let's play, last night was really a beauty contest, and Donald Trump was wise to stay
[01:48:09.280 --> 01:48:10.280]  out of it.
[01:48:10.280 --> 01:48:13.640]  Donald Trump knows what beauty contests are about, so he stayed out of this one.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:15.960]  Let's listen, though, to some of the sound bites that came out of it.
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:20.640]  Here's Rand Paul when he was asked about privacy.
[01:48:20.640 --> 01:48:24.840]  What private information should the government collect from individuals to guarantee homeland
[01:48:24.840 --> 01:48:25.840]  security?
[01:48:25.840 --> 01:48:27.840]  Where do you draw the line?
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:35.080]  Well, I think we should collect more information on terrorists, but less information on innocent
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:36.160]  individuals.
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:39.280]  We have a way now to get information, it's called the Fourth Amendment.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:43.320]  You have to individualize suspicion, and actually most of the times we've been attacked, we
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:47.160]  actually have had tips, and we just didn't follow through on them.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:52.440]  The 17th or the 19th hijacker, Miss Allie, we had information, and we failed to get
[01:48:52.440 --> 01:48:53.440]  a warrant.
[01:48:53.440 --> 01:48:54.720]  It wasn't that a warrant was denied.
[01:48:54.720 --> 01:48:59.040]  The Boston bomber, we had information, we failed to pursue it.
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:02.760]  Same way with Fort Hood Massacre, add information and fail to pursue it.
[01:49:02.760 --> 01:49:06.920]  I think we can catch terrorists if we get more information on terrorists, but there's
[01:49:06.920 --> 01:49:07.920]  no evidence.
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:11.600]  There's three bipartisan commissions that say, you know what?
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:17.000]  The information we're capturing indiscriminately on all Americans, hadn't caught any terrorists,
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.960]  it hasn't made us safer, but it has damaged our bill of rights, and it has damaged our
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:23.760]  right to privacy.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:27.480]  Senator Paul, are you concerned that it might take some time in a terrorist situation with
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:35.400]  ICE or police or federal agents to stop a bomb going off if you have to get that warrant?
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:36.400]  There's a lag here because he's...
[01:49:36.400 --> 01:49:39.920]  There are all these imminent circumstances in which things can happen.
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:42.800]  In someone screaming from a building, you don't stop to get a warrant.
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:43.800]  It's the same way with the bomb.
[01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:47.800]  So there have always been exigent circumstances, but for the most part, you do need to get
[01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:50.840]  a warrant, and the real question that is about collect...
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:54.360]  That conservative moderator is always going to come up just like the people who say, well,
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:56.000]  we have to have...
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:59.720]  We can't ban abortion because we need this particular exception or whatever.
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:04.920]  They want to destroy the bill of rights, and we've only got one guy who's going to stand
[01:50:04.920 --> 01:50:08.640]  up and say, yeah, all right, you've got a bomb that's happening, you've got a building
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:09.800]  on fire.
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:11.240]  We can do something about that.
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:14.360]  You don't have to get a warrant, obviously, for that.
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:18.400]  And as he pointed out, he's saying the same thing that the NSA whistleblowers have told
[01:50:18.400 --> 01:50:22.920]  us over and over again, that yes, they didn't use information the way that they are spying
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:28.400]  on everybody is creating a bigger haystack in which to find the needle.
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:33.240]  But we're going to hear when we come back the standard Republican line.
[01:50:33.240 --> 01:50:37.760]  And I think nobody gives that standard Republican line about how we need to destroy your freedoms
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:38.760]  to keep you safe.
[01:50:38.760 --> 01:50:43.200]  We need to tread the bill of rights in order to keep you safe than Marco Rubio.
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:45.760]  So we're going to play Marco Rubio when we come back.
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:48.760]  Stay with us.
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:51:03.920]  Communist China freely allows the sale of bulletproof armor plates, while our U.S. politicians
[01:51:03.920 --> 01:51:06.360]  argue from banning Americans from owning body armor.
[01:51:06.360 --> 01:51:08.160]  Does that sound right to you?
[01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:14.160]  From your American body at infidelbodyarmor.com, Infidel Body Armor just won't quit.
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:15.160]  Hi.

[01:51:38.840 --> 01:51:42.640]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[01:51:42.640 --> 01:51:43.640]  case.

[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:00.840]  Hi, this is Walt Augustinowitz.
[01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:03.440]  I'm the founder and CEO of ID Stronghold.
[01:53:03.440 --> 01:53:06.360]  By now you've heard our commercials about wallets that protect you from electronic
[01:53:06.360 --> 01:53:07.360]  pickpocket.
[01:53:07.360 --> 01:53:10.760]  Ten years ago I created a way to protect my own cards from prying eyes after government
[01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:14.720]  officials started talking about issuing a national ID card with a built-in radio chip
[01:53:14.720 --> 01:53:15.720]  called RFID.
[01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:20.360]  I felt having to broadcast my personal information was an invasion of privacy.
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.440]  Even after it was also announced that credit cards, debit cards, U.S. passports, hotel
[01:53:24.440 --> 01:53:28.760]  room keys, and even transit passes would all soon incorporate RFID.
[01:53:28.760 --> 01:53:32.560]  It was then I formed ID Stronghold to share my inventions in blocking RFID signals with
[01:53:32.560 --> 01:53:33.560]  the world.
[01:53:33.560 --> 01:53:36.760]  There are a lot of misconceptions out there today about RFID.
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:40.040]  I encourage everyone to get informed and get protected.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:44.200]  Please go to idstronghold.com and get the facts and the wallet sleeves or badge holders you
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.520]  need to protect your personal financial data.
[01:53:46.520 --> 01:53:50.120]  You'll be pleasantly surprised that through our direct sales model you won't pay more
[01:53:50.120 --> 01:53:52.120]  than other comparable unprotected wallets.
[01:53:52.120 --> 01:53:55.000]  It is as though the protection is free.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:21.720]  Visit idstronghold.com today.
[01:54:21.720 --> 01:54:28.320]  People who were polling around 10% two months ago at the top of the pack now probably won't
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:33.720]  even make this cut for the top 10 when it comes to the Thursday debate.
[01:54:33.720 --> 01:54:35.560]  That's the horse race aspect of it.
[01:54:35.560 --> 01:54:38.640]  And of course, at the same time we saw those kinds of numbers.
[01:54:38.640 --> 01:54:44.200]  We had Fox News deliberately omitting Rand Paul who was doing quite well.
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.200]  He was at 7%.
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:47.280]  The highest was at 10%.
[01:54:47.280 --> 01:54:50.920]  But they omitted him while showing people that were polling less, that were polling
[01:54:50.920 --> 01:54:54.360]  6%, 5%, 4%, 2%.
[01:54:54.360 --> 01:54:57.880]  They omitted him from the graphic as you can see that graphic right there.
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:55:03.560]  He was above Ted Cruz, they just chopped him off and it wasn't the only time they did that
[01:55:03.560 --> 01:55:07.960]  and they weren't the only news media to omit him from the polls.
[01:55:07.960 --> 01:55:14.560]  We just had his response to the question about what do we do about the Bill of Rights?
[01:55:14.560 --> 01:55:20.000]  Shouldn't we sacrifice the Bill of Rights on the alter of being concerned about security?
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.040]  And of course, he gave a very good answer to that.
[01:55:24.040 --> 01:55:29.400]  We're going to have the standard Republican line from Marco Rubio coming up in just one
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:30.760]  moment before that we do.
[01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:36.880]  I want to let you know that we have a flash sale today of vitamin B12 at infowarslife.com.
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:38.380]  This is a 24-hour sale.
[01:55:38.380 --> 01:55:41.120]  It is 30% off of our secret 12.
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:43.360]  That's a vitamin B12 formula.
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:45.440]  It uses nutraceutical grade B12.
[01:55:45.440 --> 01:55:48.920]  It's taken by mouth so you don't need to get it injected.
[01:55:48.920 --> 01:55:50.320]  There's no needles, folks.
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:56.840]  It's a way that you can take it painlessly orally and have it very much bioavailable.
[01:55:56.840 --> 01:56:03.720]  Again, 30% off and everything is free shipping at infowarslife.com this week.
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:08.280]  We've extended free shipping for the month of July for one more week as a way of saying
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:10.760]  thank you to those of you who support our operation.
[01:56:10.760 --> 01:56:13.600]  Again, free shipping, 30% off, B12.
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:14.600]  You can get that right now.
[01:56:14.600 --> 01:56:15.840]  It's a one-day sale.
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:18.880]  Let's go back to the response from Marco Rubio.
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:24.040]  Later on in the debate, they brought Marco Rubio up and the same moderator said, well,
[01:56:24.040 --> 01:56:28.520]  Rand Paul told us what he thought about thinking that the government is going too far.
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:29.520]  Really?
[01:56:29.520 --> 01:56:33.360]  You think the government is going too far in terms of spying on everything everybody's
[01:56:33.360 --> 01:56:34.360]  doing?
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:36.960]  Can you imagine somebody saying that at a GOP debate?
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:39.960]  Here's what Marco Rubio said.
[01:56:39.960 --> 01:56:45.200]  Senator Marco Rubio, Senator Rand Paul spoke tonight about his feeling that the government
[01:56:45.200 --> 01:56:50.720]  was going too far in trying to collect data and information on possible terrorist activity,
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:53.360]  even against individuals if they were innocent.
[01:56:53.360 --> 01:56:57.440]  Do you think that he made or that effort to do that, to get away with that data mining,
[01:56:57.440 --> 01:57:00.800]  made this country safer or less safe?
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:04.920]  And do you also, second part of this, do you trust no one in the federal government will
[01:57:04.920 --> 01:57:08.160]  misuse our phone and internet records?
[01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:09.400]  Oh, of course they wouldn't do that.
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:13.840]  They wouldn't lose them either, like they lost $4 million of their own employees' records.
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:18.080]  As a member of the United States Intelligence Committee, almost on a daily basis, I review
[01:57:18.080 --> 01:57:22.280]  the threats that are coming out of our country, and suffice it to say that we are living through
[01:57:22.280 --> 01:57:26.520]  a period that is increasingly more dangerous than we have ever lived through before.
[01:57:26.520 --> 01:57:31.840]  All the attention paid to ISIS and rightful justice to ISIS, al-Qaeda still exists.
[01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:36.800]  In fact, it's an organization looking to remain relevant, and the best way for them to remain
[01:57:36.800 --> 01:57:41.120]  relevant in their minds is to conduct a devastating attack against the United States.
[01:57:41.120 --> 01:57:44.640]  The al-Nusrah Front is growing in power within Syria.
[01:57:44.640 --> 01:57:49.680]  The Qurasan Group is actively plotting attacks abroad against the United States and our allies
[01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:54.920]  and our interests, and all these groups actively are engaging and trying to recruit and inspire
[01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:59.560]  radicals located within our own country to kill Americans and attack our interests here
[01:57:59.560 --> 01:58:00.920]  and abroad.
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:02.080]  These risks are serious.
[01:58:02.080 --> 01:58:03.600]  They are not a game.
[01:58:03.600 --> 01:58:05.760]  And in my mind, it's not a question of if we're attacked.
[01:58:05.760 --> 01:58:08.280]  It's a question of when we're attacked, and when we are.
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:11.840]  The American people are going to want to know, why didn't we know about it, and why weren't
[01:58:11.840 --> 01:58:13.480]  we able to stop it?
[01:58:13.480 --> 01:58:18.480]  So we need every tool at all at our disposal, and we have lost information we used to have,
[01:58:18.480 --> 01:58:19.480]  just in the last four years.
[01:58:19.480 --> 01:58:21.960]  Okay, let's hold it right there, because I just can't take any more of this standard
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:22.960]  Republican line.
[01:58:22.960 --> 01:58:29.120]  Look, we all know by this point that you are funding and equipping these attacks.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:32.480]  The real ones coming from ISIS, you have created real terrorists.
[01:58:32.480 --> 01:58:38.120]  You've created phony attacks by the FBI in order to sell us this twisted version of government.
[01:58:38.120 --> 01:58:39.120]  Stay with us.
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:59:08.720]  We're going to have a back and forth on the war on drugs with Marco Rubio and Chris Christie.
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:09.720]  No needles.
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:10.720]  No injections.

[01:59:51.680 --> 02:00:05.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:05.120 --> 02:00:09.880]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:09.880 --> 02:00:10.880]  You want answers?
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:13.080]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:17.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.240 --> 02:00:22.240]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:27.520]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:27.520 --> 02:00:28.520]  I'm David Knight, your host.
[02:00:28.520 --> 02:00:34.320]  We've been talking about the first, quote-unquote, debate that occurred in New Hampshire.
[02:00:34.320 --> 02:00:38.520]  Of course, it was no debate, as Yahoo pointed out.
[02:00:38.520 --> 02:00:42.520]  No debate in New Hampshire, Republican Gathering sees 14 candidates, but few fireworks.
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:45.000]  Actually, I didn't see any fireworks.
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:47.880]  There was no debate, as I pointed out, because they didn't let the candidates respond to
[02:00:47.880 --> 02:00:48.880]  each other.
[02:00:48.880 --> 02:00:50.160]  They didn't have them go face-to-face.
[02:00:50.160 --> 02:00:51.160]  That was deliberate.
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:53.000]  That was something the Republican Party said.
[02:00:53.000 --> 02:00:56.960]  They said rules put in place by the Republican National Committee to prevent GOP candidates
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:00.720]  from having to take part in too many debates to take up valuable preparation time.
[02:01:00.720 --> 02:01:07.480]  And in the opinion of the RNC, create a dynamic of ongoing Republican versus Republican criticism,
[02:01:07.480 --> 02:01:09.960]  the forum was fatally hand-strong.
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:13.880]  Even by C-SPAN standards, it was incredibly dull.
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:16.400]  That's the problem is staying awake through these things.
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:21.320]  They say that it could have been a debate, but instead they had the candidates sitting
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:25.040]  in theater's chairs in front row of an auditorium watching another one slide quickly onto a
[02:01:25.040 --> 02:01:30.000]  bar stool while their names and brief bios were read out over the loudspeaker and the
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.440]  audience set in complete silence.
[02:01:32.440 --> 02:01:36.840]  This is managed completely by the RNC.
[02:01:36.840 --> 02:01:38.320]  We need to be able to have debate.
[02:01:38.320 --> 02:01:43.160]  We need to be able to see them have ideas that are put out instead of just regurgitating
[02:01:43.160 --> 02:01:46.160]  their talking points in a controlled manner.
[02:01:46.160 --> 02:01:49.240]  But it is interesting to look at their standard talking points.
[02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:53.560]  Nobody has the talking points down more smoothly than Marco Rubio.
[02:01:53.560 --> 02:01:58.760]  He can just rattle these things off, coldly talking about how he wants to destroy all
[02:01:58.760 --> 02:02:03.400]  of your individual rights because, you know, there's a dangerous world out there.
[02:02:03.400 --> 02:02:09.800]  He is the face of the GOP's war on drugs, their war on terror.
[02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:14.680]  He is the authoritarian nice face that they put on this.
[02:02:14.680 --> 02:02:18.600]  And so, you know, when we had that Mark Dice video where they went to San Francisco and
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:21.000]  they asked people, would you destroy the Bill of Rights for Hillary Clinton?
[02:02:21.000 --> 02:02:23.600]  She wants to destroy the Bill of Rights, and of course she does.
[02:02:23.600 --> 02:02:26.120]  She wants to destroy several of the Bill of Rights.
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:27.320]  And of course, so do these guys.
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:29.160]  Will you destroy the Bill of Rights for Marco Rubio?
[02:02:29.160 --> 02:02:33.040]  Will you do it for Lindsey Graham, who says you don't get a lawyer, we're going to just
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:38.120]  grab you with the military, hold you indefinitely without trial, without charge, we're going
[02:02:38.120 --> 02:02:43.520]  to take your property without trial, without charge, not finding you guilty, that's what
[02:02:43.520 --> 02:02:50.600]  all these guys represent, all except for one, the horse called Paul Revere, Rand Paul.
[02:02:50.600 --> 02:02:55.520]  Let's go to what Marco Rubio had to say, and I want to tell you real quickly what Chris
[02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:59.880]  Christie said, very different when we come back, when we leave enough time we can do
[02:02:59.880 --> 02:03:00.880]  that.
[02:03:00.880 --> 02:03:02.600]  Let's play a little bit of Marco Rubio on the drugs.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:07.800]  Should medical marijuana be a narrowly written law, or is it okay to have conflicting laws
[02:03:07.800 --> 02:03:12.680]  in different or certain states?
[02:03:12.680 --> 02:03:16.920]  I don't support the legalization of marijuana, I understand that individual states are going
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:20.760]  through the debate of its use for medicinal purposes, I know in Florida that debate's
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:25.640]  ongoing, and as long as it truly is for medicinal purposes, and even at the national level,
[02:03:25.640 --> 02:03:30.080]  goes through, for example, the FDA process that any other medicine would have to go through,
[02:03:30.080 --> 02:03:31.880]  that's something I'm willing to explore.
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:36.680]  What I do not support is a legalization of marijuana, or any other additional intoxicant,
[02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:42.760]  this country is already paying a significant price for illegal use of drugs, and even alcohol,
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:43.760]  which is legal.
[02:03:43.760 --> 02:03:46.080]  You talk about New Hampshire for a moment, one of the stories.
[02:03:46.080 --> 02:03:47.560]  Let's stop it right there.
[02:03:47.560 --> 02:03:51.680]  We're paying a tremendous price for alcohol, which is legal, okay?
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:54.280]  Alcohol was made illegal once upon a time, why was that?
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:59.440]  It was because we passed an amendment, because the federal government has no legal authority
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:01.600]  to make alcohol or anything else illegal.
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:04.000]  Where is the amendment to make marijuana illegal?
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.480]  The amendment to make cocaine illegal, heroin illegal, where is the amendment that allows
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:13.840]  a federal government to use the FDA to keep cancer therapy and make that illegal, keep
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:14.840]  that away from people?
[02:04:14.840 --> 02:04:15.840]  There is none.
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:19.640]  This guy hates the Constitution, he destroys the Constitution, he has no legal authority
[02:04:19.640 --> 02:04:20.640]  for it.
[02:04:20.640 --> 02:04:25.280]  He says he's willing to explore letting people use marijuana for medical purposes, baloney.
[02:04:25.280 --> 02:04:30.920]  He and Jeb Bush took the money from Sheldon Adelson to shut that down, but interestingly
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:35.840]  enough, Chris Christie said the war on drugs last night, he said it was a failure.
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:40.680]  He argued that compassionate policies that he had were proving successful, I know what
[02:04:40.680 --> 02:04:44.400]  those are, but he says this is a disease, the war on drugs has been a failure, a well
[02:04:44.400 --> 02:04:46.000]  intentioned but failure.
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:50.040]  He says nonviolent offenders should have sentences reduced, more treatment should be made available
[02:04:50.040 --> 02:04:55.200]  in the face of growing heroin epidemic, and we should support our rule of law.
[02:04:55.200 --> 02:04:56.200]  Stay with us when we come back.
[02:04:56.200 --> 02:04:58.920]  We're going to be talking to Doug Hagman from Hagman and Hagman.
[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:05.080]  In what could only be described as the most mind boggling spin possible, Planned Parenthood
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:08.640]  is now claiming that it helps prevent abortions.
[02:05:08.640 --> 02:05:13.320]  In response to moves by Republicans in Congress to defund the organization, which receives
[02:05:13.320 --> 02:05:19.600]  over half a billion dollars per year in taxpayer funds, Planned Parenthood tweeted the following.
[02:05:19.600 --> 02:05:24.320]  Republicans indignant about abortion are trying to destroy a government program that helps
[02:05:24.320 --> 02:05:31.320]  prevent 345,000 abortions a year, to which one person responded, an organization claims
[02:05:31.320 --> 02:05:37.280]  it is preventing abortions while executing almost 400,000 abortions in 2013.
[02:05:37.280 --> 02:05:42.280]  And of course, this latest push happened when groups and organizations connected to Planned
[02:05:42.280 --> 02:05:47.480]  Parenthood were caught on video chopping up body parts and having individuals say that
[02:05:47.480 --> 02:05:52.080]  they wanted to use the proceeds of said body parts to purchase Lamborghinis.
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:56.320]  You can find more reports on infowars.com.

[02:08:07.400 --> 02:08:19.400]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show on this Tuesday, August 4th, 2015.
[02:08:19.400 --> 02:08:23.400]  Joining me now is Doug Hagman of hagmanandhagman.com.
[02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:27.400]  We're going to go to Doug in just one moment and we're going to talk about Planned Parenthood
[02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:29.400]  and several other issues before we do.
[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:35.400]  I just wanted to remind you that we have free shipping extended for one more week at infowarslife.com.
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:39.400]  We also have a special on silver bullet, buy two, get two free.
[02:08:39.400 --> 02:08:41.400]  In other words, 50% off.
[02:08:41.400 --> 02:08:44.400]  Normally we sell out of silver bullet, but right now we have it in stocks.
[02:08:44.400 --> 02:08:48.400]  A good time to prepare to set up your preparation stock.
[02:08:48.400 --> 02:08:54.400]  Silver bullet is our 30 parts per million colloidal silver and a base of DI&I's pure water.
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:09:00.400]  And you can get free shipping on it like all of the products that we have at infowarslife.com.
[02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:05.400]  That's the way of saying thank you to those who support us. We're extending that free shipping for one more week.
[02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:11.400]  And you can get free shipping on everything at the infowarslife.com store.
[02:09:11.400 --> 02:09:14.400]  Again, silver bullet, buy two, get two free.
[02:09:14.400 --> 02:09:16.400]  Half off right now.
[02:09:16.400 --> 02:09:20.400]  Doug Hagman is the founder and director of the Northeast Intelligence Network.
[02:09:20.400 --> 02:09:26.400]  He's CEO of a multi-state licensed private investigative agency serving many Fortune 500 clients.
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:30.400]  He is also the author of tactical surveillance.
[02:09:30.400 --> 02:09:34.400]  And so I wanted to talk to him before we get into, there's a lot of different topics.
[02:09:34.400 --> 02:09:37.400]  We want to talk about ISIS in the Middle East, the Iran nuclear agreement.
[02:09:37.400 --> 02:09:41.400]  Before we do that, though, I want to talk to Doug about Planned Parenthood.
[02:09:41.400 --> 02:09:47.400]  And of course, let me get everyone up to date on what's happened with the news on Planned Parenthood today.
[02:09:47.400 --> 02:09:53.400]  We know that there were these movements in the last few, several days, end of last week.
[02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:59.400]  There were these movements to block these videos that are coming out from this group center for medical progress.
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:07.400]  They were successful in getting a judge to put an injunction out to stop the reporting of videos that involved STEM Express.
[02:10:07.400 --> 02:10:11.400]  I don't know what the basis of that injunction is.
[02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:13.400]  I don't see that as being a reasonable thing.
[02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:15.400]  I think we need to see what's going on.
[02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:17.400]  The public needs to know.
[02:10:17.400 --> 02:10:21.400]  And if there's criminal activity, I don't understand why a judge would put an injunction on it.
[02:10:21.400 --> 02:10:26.400]  Plus, National Abortion Federation also joined in that to try to keep that out of there.
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:32.400]  And of course, the CMP head, the people who have done this center for medical progress, said he believed they're trying to block the video
[02:10:32.400 --> 02:10:34.400]  because they have video that they've already shot.
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:39.400]  They're about to release that could prove that aborted babies were born alive and then harvested.
[02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:41.400]  Today, we've had the fifth video come out.
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:44.400]  And you can see this on Infowars.com.
[02:10:44.400 --> 02:10:46.400]  Fifth Planned Parenthood video.
[02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.400]  Official brags that whole bodies of babies are just a matter of quote-unquote line items.
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:55.400]  The official says we can get intact fetal cadavers delivered.
[02:10:55.400 --> 02:11:01.400]  This time, the official discuss selling intact specimens, in other words, whole bodies of babies.
[02:11:01.400 --> 02:11:03.400]  That's what we would call an entire baby.
[02:11:03.400 --> 02:11:06.400]  They call it an intact cadaver specimen.
[02:11:06.400 --> 02:11:09.400]  We call that a baby that they've killed.
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:15.400]  And as Dana Lesh pointed out, wow, around 321 Planned Parenthood discusses selling whole bodies of babies.
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:21.400]  Another comment, Steven Miller says Planned Parenthood director is on tape confirming several times the process can be altered to meet client needs.
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:25.400]  This is illegal. It's not hard to see this.
[02:11:25.400 --> 02:11:28.400]  Yeah, we all see exactly what's going on with this.
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:30.400]  Now, what's being done about it?
[02:11:30.400 --> 02:11:40.400]  Well, of course, we had Rand Paul working very hard also with Ted Cruz trying to defund Planned Parenthood at the federal level.
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:44.400]  Being resisted by GOP leadership like Mitch McConnell.
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:52.400]  And being joined by people on the other side like Democrat Senator Joe Manchin said he would vote to defund Planned Parenthood.
[02:11:52.400 --> 02:11:55.400]  We need to support people when they're right on the right issues.
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:12:01.400]  We need to support them when they do the right thing and not get caught up in party politics.
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:09.400]  So Joe Manchin worked with Cruz, worked with Rand Paul to try to stop the funding of Planned Parenthood.
[02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:15.400]  Good for him and realize the leaders of the Republican Party who oppose that because it got stopped.
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:19.400]  It failed. They came up for a vote yesterday. The vote was 53 to 46.
[02:12:19.400 --> 02:12:26.400]  The measure failed to get the 60 votes that would be needed to overcome a Democrat filibuster because the majority of Democrats are against it.
[02:12:26.400 --> 02:12:28.400]  They would filibuster this.
[02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:33.400]  But again, as I pointed out, there are some Democrats like Joe Manchin who voted for it.
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:40.400]  GOP Senator Rand Paul pressed the Senate leaders for the vote on Planned Parenthood. He said, I support any legislation that will defund Planned Parenthood.
[02:12:40.400 --> 02:12:45.400]  I don't think you start out with an objective to shut down the government because they were saying, well, you're just going to shut down the government.
[02:12:45.400 --> 02:12:49.400]  It's like, no, we're trying to shut down these criminal practices.
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:53.400]  One more thing and then we'll go to Doug Hagman and get his comments on this.
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:13:00.400]  I've said many times I think that it is not possible to really affect change in Washington anymore.
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:04.400]  Certainly, it's definitely worth the try. We should never stop trying.
[02:13:04.400 --> 02:13:10.400]  And I appreciate the efforts of Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Joe Manchin, and others who tried to do that.
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:12.400]  Nevertheless, take a look at what happened in Louisiana.
[02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:16.400]  Again, another article that's up on Infowars.com. Louisiana cuts off Planned Parenthood funding.
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:21.400]  This is an effort by Bobby Jindal, the Louisiana governor.
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:24.400]  He cut off state funding for Planned Parenthood.
[02:13:24.400 --> 02:13:30.400]  Not only did he block Medicaid money to Planned Parenthood, the Gulf Coast on Monday,
[02:13:30.400 --> 02:13:36.400]  he also barred the State Department of Health and Hospitals from funding the organization.
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:39.400]  You can have more effect, I believe, and I think this is another example of it,
[02:13:39.400 --> 02:13:45.400]  how you can have more effect working locally and working at the state level than you can at the national level.
[02:13:45.400 --> 02:13:50.400]  We should fight them everywhere, but we need to understand that instead of focusing the majority,
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:55.400]  90% of our efforts at the federal government level, I think we should do just the opposite.
[02:13:55.400 --> 02:14:01.400]  This should be 90% at the local level, contain them, cut them off, make the changes locally where we can have the most effect.
[02:14:01.400 --> 02:14:05.400]  Now, let's go to Doug Hagman. Thank you, Doug, for joining us.
[02:14:05.400 --> 02:14:07.400]  Well, thanks for having me. We really appreciate it.
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:11.400]  And you're right on the money in terms of your assessment.
[02:14:11.400 --> 02:14:19.400]  Hitting them on a state level, I think, would be much more effective than attempting to defund them from a federal level.
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:22.400]  However, and I'm not sure how many people know this.
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:29.400]  According to their 2014 annual report, the taxpayer-funded government health services for Planned Parenthood,
[02:14:29.400 --> 02:14:37.400]  a half a billion dollars, $540.6 million. That's not a cheap date.
[02:14:37.400 --> 02:14:44.400]  Absolutely. They're getting a massive amount of money at the federal level, so we can't just fight it at the local level.
[02:14:44.400 --> 02:14:52.400]  Here in Austin, Doug, we found out when we talked to Abby Johnson, we found out that just in the city of Austin,
[02:14:52.400 --> 02:14:59.400]  they have given Planned Parenthood a 20-year lease, $1 a year, for a 7,000-square-foot facility.
[02:14:59.400 --> 02:15:04.400]  And I think this kind of thing is happening all over the country, and most people don't know about it.
[02:15:04.400 --> 02:15:09.400]  We know about the half a billion dollars, and it's difficult to stop that.
[02:15:09.400 --> 02:15:16.400]  But many people don't know about these other things that are being done, like a $1 lease for a 7,000-square-foot facility
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:20.400]  that are being done locally, and that's going to be easier. It's still going to be difficult to change,
[02:15:20.400 --> 02:15:24.400]  but that's the kind of thing, and change the politicians if you can't change the lease.
[02:15:24.400 --> 02:15:30.400]  That kind of thing is still pretty much in the dark, and people don't understand all those other subsidies
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:34.400]  that Planned Parenthood is getting at various other levels.
[02:15:34.400 --> 02:15:41.400]  Bloomberg donated $250,000 here not too long ago, but you know, when we look at this,
[02:15:41.400 --> 02:15:46.400]  and this is kind of why I was really wanted to focus on this,
[02:15:46.400 --> 02:15:52.400]  I believe that the two of the greatest threats to the stability of our Republican form of government
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:57.400]  and our rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights are abortion and gun control.
[02:15:57.400 --> 02:16:01.400]  I mean, when you look at it, the Supreme Court justices who voted for abortion,
[02:16:01.400 --> 02:16:07.400]  well, this is back, you know, they acted outside of the pale, of course, outside of the Constitution
[02:16:07.400 --> 02:16:14.400]  when they said the Fourth Amendment right to privacy, that right could be interpreted as rights of a woman
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:20.400]  to a border unborn child. So they perverted the Constitution a number of years ago,
[02:16:20.400 --> 02:16:27.400]  well, back in 73, and have used that as a template and are using that very same tactic
[02:16:27.400 --> 02:16:32.400]  to attack us on the level of the Second Amendment. So I think the reason,
[02:16:32.400 --> 02:16:38.400]  I think people have to understand the assault on the American, or on the Constitution
[02:16:38.400 --> 02:16:45.400]  by the people in power, and the other side of that, very closely related, you know, as Americans.
[02:16:45.400 --> 02:16:50.400]  And I know this kind of sounds pretty nebulous and vague, but I think as Americans,
[02:16:50.400 --> 02:16:55.400]  we've tolerated, we've embraced, and we've even championed a lot of things
[02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:59.400]  that would have horrified our parents and our grandparents generations ago.
[02:16:59.400 --> 02:17:00.400]  Oh, absolutely, yes.
[02:17:00.400 --> 02:17:04.400]  Now, so when we look at this, banning the Ten Commandments,
[02:17:04.400 --> 02:17:10.400]  and we're seeing this incremental attack on our freedoms via Christianity,
[02:17:10.400 --> 02:17:15.400]  attack on Christianity, we're seeing the Ten Commandments expunge from public place as a race.
[02:17:15.400 --> 02:17:21.400]  We're looking at the slow starvation of the disabled.
[02:17:21.400 --> 02:17:26.400]  All of this points to genocide and eugenics, people don't, and you know,
[02:17:26.400 --> 02:17:30.400]  I was listening to you earlier, I mean, people don't have this understanding
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:35.400]  of what Planned Parenthood, how it started, how, when it's rooted in,
[02:17:35.400 --> 02:17:40.400]  and it's a genocidal type program, it's eugenics, and of all races, of all people,
[02:17:40.400 --> 02:17:45.400]  black people should be just outraged over what's going on, because at its core,
[02:17:45.400 --> 02:17:51.400]  the Sanger, and, you know, back in the Sanger days, a pre-Planned Parenthood,
[02:17:51.400 --> 02:17:57.400]  a Southland Planned Parenthood, of course, Margaret Sanger was the most hideous form of racist
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:02.400]  around where she wanted to cleanse society of black people,
[02:18:02.400 --> 02:18:04.400]  and of people with any kind of disability.
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:07.400]  So people really need to get into the meat of this,
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:09.400]  and mainstream media's not touching any of this.
[02:18:09.400 --> 02:18:12.400]  They're not understanding that, you know, the guide stones,
[02:18:12.400 --> 02:18:15.400]  those Georgia guide stones are in fact real, for example,
[02:18:15.400 --> 02:18:19.400]  and, you know, they mean to, the powers that be, the power elite,
[02:18:19.400 --> 02:18:24.400]  mean to cut down the coal population down to half a million, or half a billion people.
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:27.400]  Oh, absolutely, talking about the Georgia guide stones, everybody's saying,
[02:18:27.400 --> 02:18:29.400]  well, you know, who is it that put that up there?
[02:18:29.400 --> 02:18:31.400]  We don't really know who put that up there.
[02:18:31.400 --> 02:18:35.400]  Well, we know what the Pope is saying now, and we know who he's made,
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:38.400]  one of his top scientific advisors, Schellenhoober,
[02:18:38.400 --> 02:18:43.400]  and the Pope is coming and selling his global warming agenda,
[02:18:43.400 --> 02:18:47.400]  and doing it in the name, you know, using this guy that has talked about
[02:18:47.400 --> 02:18:50.400]  having massive depopulation, just like the Georgia guide stones are talking about,
[02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:51.400]  just like you mentioned.
[02:18:51.400 --> 02:18:55.400]  Schellenhoober is talking about getting rid of most of the people on Earth
[02:18:55.400 --> 02:18:58.400]  and establishing a planetary governance,
[02:18:58.400 --> 02:19:01.400]  a planetary council, planetary court to haul you before,
[02:19:01.400 --> 02:19:05.400]  all in the name of global warming, and now we've got a face on it.
[02:19:05.400 --> 02:19:07.400]  We've got the Pope doing it, we've got Prince Charles doing it,
[02:19:07.400 --> 02:19:10.400]  we've got Obama doing it, these guys are openly doing it,
[02:19:10.400 --> 02:19:16.400]  what they were hiding before when they anonymously put up the Georgia guide stones.
[02:19:16.400 --> 02:19:20.400]  Exactly, and I think if people look at the bigger picture of this,
[02:19:20.400 --> 02:19:23.400]  we can see where this is just one part,
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:28.400]  but an all by a very important part of the globalist agenda,
[02:19:28.400 --> 02:19:31.400]  and they're going to fight tooth and nail,
[02:19:31.400 --> 02:19:32.400]  the globalists are going to fight tooth and nail,
[02:19:32.400 --> 02:19:35.400]  but the people in power in Congress,
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:38.400]  they're going to fight to make sure that none of this,
[02:19:38.400 --> 02:19:43.400]  none of these videos see the light of day as evidenced by the injunction.
[02:19:43.400 --> 02:19:48.400]  However, and I'll say this, I spent a number of years as an operational asset
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:52.400]  from the FBI taking cover video just like the Center for Medical Progress.
[02:19:52.400 --> 02:19:54.400]  Hang on Doug, we've got to talk about that when we come back,
[02:19:54.400 --> 02:19:55.400]  we've got to go to our break.
[02:19:55.400 --> 02:20:06.400]  Doug Hagman of Hagman and Hagman, we'll be right back.
[02:20:26.400 --> 02:20:30.400]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric,
[02:20:30.400 --> 02:20:33.400]  engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit
[02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:36.400]  and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest,
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:37.400]  forcing taxes to service debt.
[02:20:37.400 --> 02:20:40.400]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank
[02:20:40.400 --> 02:20:43.400]  issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people
[02:20:43.400 --> 02:20:44.400]  than a standing army.
[02:20:44.400 --> 02:20:46.400]  Ted Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book
[02:20:46.400 --> 02:20:48.400]  that explains our monetary system.
[02:20:48.400 --> 02:20:51.400]  Call for your copy 800-686-2237.
[02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:55.400]  It's time to understand the system, call 800-686-2237.
[02:20:55.400 --> 02:20:57.400]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:20:57.400 --> 02:21:01.400]  As if chlorine in our water weren't bad enough, now they're adding ammonia?
[02:21:01.400 --> 02:21:06.400]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply.
[02:21:06.400 --> 02:21:08.400]  It's a disinfectant called chloramine.
[02:21:08.400 --> 02:21:13.400]  But with a trusted big Berkey water filter, you can keep chloramine out of your water.
[02:21:13.400 --> 02:21:19.400]  New NSF EPA certified lab tests show EPA Berkey water filters remove chloramines,
[02:21:19.400 --> 02:21:26.400]  pharmaceuticals, BPA, pesticides, bacteria and viruses, all forms of fluoride and much more.
[02:21:26.400 --> 02:21:30.400]  Big Berkey water filters are the original and most trusted on the market.
[02:21:30.400 --> 02:21:37.400]  The gold standard in water purification and our filters last for years at less than 2 cents per gallon.
[02:21:37.400 --> 02:21:42.400]  Big Berkey, the one that's powerful enough to purify stagnant pond water.
[02:21:42.400 --> 02:21:44.400]  Get your Big Berkey today.

[02:21:57.400 --> 02:22:04.400]  Usually the older one gets, the less you are able to absorb amino acids and the less you are able to repair the 100 trillion cells of your body.
[02:22:04.400 --> 02:22:09.400]  As a result, you'll have less energy, your tissues will shrink and you'll become wrinkled.
[02:22:09.400 --> 02:22:12.400]  An older person will typically injure more easily and heal more slowly.
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:14.400]  Not fun.
[02:22:14.400 --> 02:22:22.400]  However, if you could consume a protein powder that is easier to absorb, then you may be able to gain back some strength, muscle and speed of recovery.

[02:23:56.400 --> 02:24:08.400]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:24:14.400 --> 02:24:19.400]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight and we're talking to Doug Hagman of HagmanandHagman.com.
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:29.400]  That's his website. He's also a multi-state licensed private investigator and he's a CEO of an investigative agency.
[02:24:29.400 --> 02:24:35.400]  We're going to talk to him about how investigations are done in light of Planned Parenthood.
[02:24:35.400 --> 02:24:39.400]  Of course, we had the vote yesterday and you can see the story on Infowars.com.
[02:24:39.400 --> 02:24:44.400]  Democrats who voted against defunding Planned Parenthood never even watched the expose.
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:47.400]  Some bizarrely claim that the footage is doctored.
[02:24:47.400 --> 02:24:52.400]  Look, we've been told by the Obama administration that these videos are conspiracy, that they're a hoax.
[02:24:52.400 --> 02:24:56.400]  Now we have Representative Alan Grayson says,
[02:24:56.400 --> 02:25:03.400]  Tonight a bunch of men will vote against women seeing doctors, quote unquote, because they saw a doctored video.
[02:25:03.400 --> 02:25:07.400]  That's the GOP for you. Yeah, you know what? These guys are butchers. They're not doctors.
[02:25:07.400 --> 02:25:11.400]  Joseph Mingola was a doctor too, okay?
[02:25:11.400 --> 02:25:16.400]  A doctor is somebody that helps people, doesn't butcher innocent babies.
[02:25:16.400 --> 02:25:18.400]  Now this is something that was offered by Johnny Ernst.
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:24.400]  Rand Paul Ted Cruz worked on it. We also had a Democrat, Joe Manchin at least, voted for it.
[02:25:24.400 --> 02:25:30.400]  I don't know how many others, but this is something that we see them pushing back saying it's just a conspiracy theory.
[02:25:30.400 --> 02:25:34.400]  This is something that is an investigation, isn't it, Doug?
[02:25:34.400 --> 02:25:40.400]  You know, this is so important right now. I think we're at a hinge moment in our history.
[02:25:40.400 --> 02:25:49.400]  And I'll tell you why. Before the break, I was mentioning that as an investigator, I worked as an operational asset for the Department of Justice and the FBI.
[02:25:49.400 --> 02:25:55.400]  And I took a covert video just exactly like we have seen from the Center for Medical Progress.
[02:25:55.400 --> 02:25:57.400]  Exactly, yes.
[02:25:57.400 --> 02:26:02.400]  And I'll tell you something. Every single court case, every time a case like that went to court,
[02:26:02.400 --> 02:26:08.400]  and it was very few because most pleaded out after knowing that they were on videotape.
[02:26:08.400 --> 02:26:14.400]  But in this case, the playbook for defense is the same. The tape is number one. Oh, it's edited.
[02:26:14.400 --> 02:26:18.400]  It doesn't hold it in a ton of context. Right.
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:24.400]  The second thing is it taken under false pretexts.
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:36.400]  Well, that happens all the time. It's a common course for law enforcement, for example, to misrepresent themselves and insert themselves in a situation where there's an ongoing criminal activity.
[02:26:36.400 --> 02:26:45.400]  And certainly, Planned Parenthood falls in that category when they are talking about transporting body parts, period, or harvesting body parts.
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:50.400]  And I say infant body parts. That's exactly what they're doing.
[02:26:50.400 --> 02:27:00.400]  So all of this, so the playbook that is being used by the defenders, the same playbook that's being used by the defense attorneys all over this country.
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:11.400]  And it's tried true and worn out. And the fact of the matter is it's nothing but a smokescreen to take away, to deflect from the topic of the felonious activity taking place at Planned Parenthood.
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:25.400]  And I wrote an article, I suppose it appeared on CanadaFreePress.com and HagenHagen.com about my experiences as an investigator and the comparison made between the cries against the video versus what I experienced.
[02:27:25.400 --> 02:27:30.400]  That's a great point, Doug. You're talking about how in every one of these cases, this is a standard investigation procedure.
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:38.400]  In every one of these cases, they say this is doctored, this is heavily edited, it's taken out of context, this is entrapment.
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:51.400]  And sometimes it can be entrapment when the FBI does it. When they create the threat, when they go into many of these fake terrorist situations that they create out of a whole cloth, they create the organization,
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:58.400]  they entrap people into this, they equip them, they drive them to the place. In many cases like that, I do believe that it's entrapment.
[02:27:58.400 --> 02:28:08.400]  But when there's a criminal operation that is going on that they know about and then they come in and say, well, we want to sell to your criminal organization or buy from it or be a part of it or whatever,
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:15.400]  they know that this is already going on and then they come in there under those circumstances. That's not entrapment, that's an investigation.
[02:28:15.400 --> 02:28:18.400]  And that's exactly what this Planned Parenthood video is.
[02:28:18.400 --> 02:28:30.400]  Yeah, and I don't mean to belabor the point, but entrapment would be, let's say a business owner, a piece of shop owner making pizzas, never had a problem with the criminal history at all.
[02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:36.400]  And then the FBI comes in and says, look, I want you to build a bomb, I'm going to help. You know, that's entrapment.
[02:28:36.400 --> 02:28:38.400]  Exactly, exactly.
[02:28:38.400 --> 02:28:49.400]  This is a course of conduct that these people are engaged in every single day. They're not asking anything except for information. And if you watch the tapes, the video is closely.
[02:28:49.400 --> 02:29:00.400]  And by the way, the information I got, and I'll share this on, if it were exclusively, information I got, the video that they have is extremely damning.
[02:29:00.400 --> 02:29:12.400]  We haven't seen, we haven't seen the best yet, the best is yet to come, and it's just going to be, it's going to indict many, could indict many people in terms of criminal activity,
[02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:19.400]  sickening criminal activity. And then there's the satanic element of this too that's not being reported.
[02:29:19.400 --> 02:29:23.400]  And I'll just briefly touch on that, the information I have is...
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:27.400]  Well, hang on, we're going to talk about that when we come, I've got to go another break, but that, yeah, I agree with you.
[02:29:27.400 --> 02:29:34.400]  I think the most damning stuff is definitely to come. They had nine videos. We have had, I think, just the fifth one released today.
[02:29:34.400 --> 02:29:58.400]  That's why they want to stop this. That's why they're trying to shut it down using the court. Stay with us. We'll be right back with Doug Hagman of Hagman and Hagman.com.
[02:30:05.400 --> 02:30:09.400]  To step into the digital octagon with Rowdy Ronda Rousey.
[02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:18.400]  In the wake of a knockout performance at UFC 190, social justice warriors just couldn't take hearing any more about Rousey being a strong female role model.
[02:30:18.400 --> 02:30:28.400]  They attacked Rousey over the internet for her past comments regarding transgender MMA fighter Fallon Fox calling the Rowdy one a transphobic.
[02:30:28.400 --> 02:30:35.400]  Rousey said in regards to Fox, she can try hormones, chop her pecker off, but it's still the same bone structure a man has.
[02:30:35.400 --> 02:30:43.400]  It's an advantage and I don't think it's fair. Upon hearing this, the digital dominators put up their two hands only to use their two thumbs,
[02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:50.400]  and went a full five rounds with Ronda on Twitter, saying things like, Ronda Rousey thinks trans women are men.
[02:30:50.400 --> 02:30:56.400]  How dare you speak that common sense, Ronda? You can find more reports on infowars.com.
[02:30:56.400 --> 02:31:02.400]  Another major health threat. This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has been told not to drink the water.
[02:31:02.400 --> 02:31:05.400]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:31:05.400 --> 02:31:12.400]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:31:12.400 --> 02:31:15.400]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:31:15.400 --> 02:31:18.400]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:31:18.400 --> 02:31:23.400]  Well, here at a supermarket in Toledo, you can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:31:23.400 --> 02:31:28.400]  Stay safe and healthy during a crisis. You must have access to safe, clean water.
[02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:32.400]  Water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:31:32.400 --> 02:31:35.400]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:33:21.400 --> 02:33:24.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:28.400 --> 02:33:30.400]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:30.400 --> 02:33:34.400]  I'm David Knight and we're talking to Doug Hagman of Hagman and Hagman.com.
[02:33:34.400 --> 02:33:40.400]  Of course, Doug Hagman is the CEO of a multi-state investigative agency.
[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:45.400]  And he's had experience in the past doing investigations, doing them for the government.
[02:33:45.400 --> 02:33:55.400]  He explained to us before the break the difference between entrapment and investigation and how people will use these same types of excuses
[02:33:55.400 --> 02:33:59.400]  and defending their clients caught on tape and illegal activities.
[02:33:59.400 --> 02:34:06.400]  The same things that we're seeing being used by the Democrats to explain what's going on with these Planned Parenthood tapes.
[02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:08.400]  Oh, they were taken out of context.
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:11.400]  We never said that they were heavily edited.
[02:34:11.400 --> 02:34:15.400]  Or we were entrapped. And so I'm going to have him explain to you one more time real quickly.
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:23.400]  Because I think it's very important for the public to understand the difference between entrapment and a sting operation of a known criminal organization.
[02:34:23.400 --> 02:34:25.400]  So we'll revisit that.
[02:34:25.400 --> 02:34:32.400]  And then he was just beginning to talk about the connection with the satanic with these videos and what we have now learned about that.
[02:34:32.400 --> 02:34:35.400]  So we're going to go back to that real briefly before we do.
[02:34:35.400 --> 02:34:40.400]  I just want to let you know and remind you again that we have free shipping on everything at infowarslife.com.
[02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:42.400]  We've extended that for one more week.
[02:34:42.400 --> 02:34:47.400]  And one of the products that we sell there, oxypowder, something you ought to take a look at.
[02:34:47.400 --> 02:34:50.400]  It is scientifically formulated to gently cleanse your colon.
[02:34:50.400 --> 02:34:53.400]  It doesn't require time off from work.
[02:34:53.400 --> 02:34:56.400]  It's all natural. Oxygen colon cleanser.
[02:34:56.400 --> 02:34:58.400]  It's available through infowarslife.com.
[02:34:58.400 --> 02:34:59.400]  Again, that's oxypowder.
[02:34:59.400 --> 02:35:04.400]  Let me read you one of the testimonials because we have a lot of testimonials about all of our products.
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:07.400]  Here's one about oxypowder.
[02:35:07.400 --> 02:35:10.400]  This is from Milford in Colorado, Aurora, Colorado.
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:14.400]  It says, oxypowder helps me keep my intestines clean and digestion in line.
[02:35:14.400 --> 02:35:16.400]  I started taking oxypowder a year ago.
[02:35:16.400 --> 02:35:18.400]  I've lost 60 pounds.
[02:35:18.400 --> 02:35:21.400]  I take six pills at night with water about four hours after my last meal of the day.
[02:35:21.400 --> 02:35:30.400]  I also eat well, count my calories, but oxypowder has definitely been an invaluable resource in my personal quest towards healthy weight and lifestyle.
[02:35:30.400 --> 02:35:32.400]  I now look and feel amazing.
[02:35:32.400 --> 02:35:35.400]  Again, go to infowarslife.com.
[02:35:35.400 --> 02:35:37.400]  Look at the products there.
[02:35:37.400 --> 02:35:42.400]  Look at the reviews and see if the products are which ones are right for your health, your condition.
[02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:46.400]  You can be helped with that by those reviews that we keep online.
[02:35:46.400 --> 02:35:48.400]  That's why we have them there.
[02:35:48.400 --> 02:35:52.400]  Again, everything at infowarslife.com is free shipping through this week.
[02:35:52.400 --> 02:35:57.400]  We've extended that for one more week as a thank you to those of you who support our operation.
[02:35:57.400 --> 02:36:00.400]  Let's go back to Doug Hagman now and Doug.
[02:36:00.400 --> 02:36:04.400]  Let's just repeat real quickly what you said because you gave us a legal version of entrapment.
[02:36:04.400 --> 02:36:08.400]  You've done this in conjunction with the FBI for real criminals.
[02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:10.400]  It's very important.
[02:36:10.400 --> 02:36:15.400]  As an investigator, what needs to be done and what's going to hold up in court and what's not going to hold up in court,
[02:36:15.400 --> 02:36:17.400]  you pointed out that they always use excuses.
[02:36:17.400 --> 02:36:19.400]  It's taken out of context.
[02:36:19.400 --> 02:36:22.400]  They heavily edited this or they say entrapment.
[02:36:22.400 --> 02:36:32.400]  Tell us again the difference between entrapment and something where they're investigating a known criminal organization presenting themselves in there in a false pretext,
[02:36:32.400 --> 02:36:36.400]  but something where they're investigating a known criminal activity.
[02:36:36.400 --> 02:36:38.400]  Just to be clear, I'm not an attorney.
[02:36:38.400 --> 02:36:40.400]  I'm an investigator by profession.
[02:36:40.400 --> 02:36:42.400]  The bottom line is this.
[02:36:42.400 --> 02:36:51.400]  Entrapment would entail or would necessitate someone of the government or a law enforcement official going into a business,
[02:36:51.400 --> 02:36:55.400]  let's say a pizza shop owner, and out of the blue looking at the owner and saying,
[02:36:55.400 --> 02:36:57.400]  look, I want you to build me a bomb or I want you to appear.
[02:36:57.400 --> 02:37:00.400]  I want you to traffic and some drugs here.
[02:37:00.400 --> 02:37:05.400]  Something that the pizza shop owner would not normally do or the person would not normally do.
[02:37:05.400 --> 02:37:14.400]  It's not within his realm of business and then can keep harassing the business owner to do that.
[02:37:14.400 --> 02:37:15.400]  That's entrapment.
[02:37:15.400 --> 02:37:24.400]  I mean, clear and simple, but here you've got an operation already existing operation that is dealing in the trafficking of human body parts.
[02:37:24.400 --> 02:37:27.400]  Now, when I really drive that home, this is what they're doing.
[02:37:27.400 --> 02:37:33.400]  The covert operatives going in are not doing or not asking anything,
[02:37:33.400 --> 02:37:37.400]  asking these people to do anything outside of what they're already doing.
[02:37:37.400 --> 02:37:40.400]  And as a matter of fact, they're not asking them to do anything period.
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:49.400]  Every tape I've seen, every video I've seen is merely inquiries as to price, haggling over price.
[02:37:49.400 --> 02:37:51.400]  Exactly. We've already established what they are.
[02:37:51.400 --> 02:37:54.400]  We're just haggling over the price precisely.
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:59.400]  And this video that's come out today is not just baby body parts.
[02:37:59.400 --> 02:38:04.400]  It's an entire bodies of babies that they're offering out there.
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:06.400]  And when we see these videos in the past, they say,
[02:38:06.400 --> 02:38:09.400]  well, this is the way we've done it in the past with other organizations.
[02:38:09.400 --> 02:38:11.400]  That's not entrapment.
[02:38:11.400 --> 02:38:13.400]  That's showing a pattern of behavior.
[02:38:13.400 --> 02:38:20.400]  And we saw in the very first video, I think it was in the second video, it was the Lamborghini lady.
[02:38:20.400 --> 02:38:22.400]  She was talking about how they had this one organization come in.
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:25.400]  She says, well, this lady comes in. She goes through everything. She cuts it up.
[02:38:25.400 --> 02:38:28.400]  She takes the parts that she needs. We don't have to do anything.
[02:38:28.400 --> 02:38:29.400]  It's very profitable.
[02:38:29.400 --> 02:38:32.400]  And that's the only exclusion that they have under the law,
[02:38:32.400 --> 02:38:36.400]  is that they can get compensated for some things that they might do associated with it.
[02:38:36.400 --> 02:38:38.400]  But she makes it clear they weren't doing anything.
[02:38:38.400 --> 02:38:40.400]  They were just getting the money, just selling the parts.
[02:38:40.400 --> 02:38:42.400]  Yeah, yes.
[02:38:42.400 --> 02:38:50.400]  And, you know, in later term abortions, and I use that word,
[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:56.400]  for example, the difference between murder, which is obviously against the law,
[02:38:56.400 --> 02:38:59.400]  and an abortion is about three inches.
[02:38:59.400 --> 02:39:03.400]  What they're doing is they're, the mechanics of it,
[02:39:03.400 --> 02:39:06.400]  is they're flipping the baby around to present breach first.
[02:39:06.400 --> 02:39:10.400]  And legs come out, keeping the head inside of the woman.
[02:39:10.400 --> 02:39:14.400]  And as long as the head is inside, they're able to do whatever,
[02:39:14.400 --> 02:39:17.400]  to kill the unborn child.
[02:39:17.400 --> 02:39:20.400]  And that protects them legally.
[02:39:20.400 --> 02:39:24.400]  It's just a mere three inches that separates a first degree murder charge
[02:39:24.400 --> 02:39:27.400]  with a legal process of abortion.
[02:39:27.400 --> 02:39:30.400]  And they know that, and so they talk about how they,
[02:39:30.400 --> 02:39:32.400]  well, if you've got particular things that you want,
[02:39:32.400 --> 02:39:36.400]  we can make arrangements so that we reposition the baby
[02:39:36.400 --> 02:39:39.400]  into that breach birth position that you're talking about.
[02:39:39.400 --> 02:39:42.400]  So they know where the lines are drawn,
[02:39:42.400 --> 02:39:47.400]  and they're even talking on this video about how they can skirt around those lines.
[02:39:47.400 --> 02:39:51.400]  Exactly. And I know we're kind of short on time,
[02:39:51.400 --> 02:39:55.400]  but one thing I wanted to touch on, too, is we have to follow the money.
[02:39:55.400 --> 02:39:59.400]  I think people would be surprised that once the money, you follow the money,
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:01.400]  you follow the people involved in this.
[02:40:01.400 --> 02:40:03.400]  The very people who are involved in Planned Parenthood,
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:06.400]  who are involved in the national abortion rights,
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:11.400]  all of these different minor organizations or smaller organizations out there
[02:40:11.400 --> 02:40:16.400]  are, there's an insetuous involvement between them and the globalists,
[02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:22.400]  between them and the gang of bait, for example, the leaders of Congress.
[02:40:22.400 --> 02:40:28.400]  And as well, there is a satanic element to this that people,
[02:40:28.400 --> 02:40:31.400]  well, we don't talk about this in polite company, actually, right?
[02:40:31.400 --> 02:40:33.400]  We don't like to talk about this.
[02:40:33.400 --> 02:40:38.400]  But you know, the satanic temple of Detroit, Joe, my son, who goes to the show with me,
[02:40:38.400 --> 02:40:41.400]  was telling me about the satanic temple of Detroit.
[02:40:41.400 --> 02:40:47.400]  Well, that's that Baphomet statue that was the largest public satanic ceremony in history.
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:50.400]  They were charged $25, $75 for tickets.
[02:40:50.400 --> 02:40:56.400]  Well, first, I just wanted to support the reproductive rights of abortion.
[02:40:56.400 --> 02:41:05.400]  And they collected some $32,000, I believe, so far to fund these abortion rituals.
[02:41:05.400 --> 02:41:10.400]  And I say rituals because in the scheme of a satanic temple,
[02:41:10.400 --> 02:41:14.400]  when you start looking at who these people are, what their practices are,
[02:41:14.400 --> 02:41:18.400]  the satanic temple itself, TST,
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:26.400]  they are actually promoting this satanic aspect element of children's child sacrifice.
[02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:28.400]  We've seen that here in Texas.
[02:41:28.400 --> 02:41:32.400]  We had the massive rallies at the state capitol where they were talking about that
[02:41:32.400 --> 02:41:35.400]  and they had people out there chanting, Hail Satan.
[02:41:35.400 --> 02:41:40.400]  We saw it when the Info Wars reporters went to the Planned Parenthood abortion clinic here.
[02:41:40.400 --> 02:41:46.400]  It always seems to come up and it's brought up by the people who are there supporting abortion.
[02:41:46.400 --> 02:41:49.400]  It's not us. We're not saying, hey, you're a bunch of satanists. No, they bring it up.
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:51.400]  They start saying that.
[02:41:51.400 --> 02:41:54.400]  I mean, you guys almost knocked me off my chair when I saw that.
[02:41:54.400 --> 02:42:02.400]  When you had that clip of that woman, Hail Satan, and the satanic chants and what have you, it was incredible.
[02:42:02.400 --> 02:42:05.400]  But see, this is how overt this has become.
[02:42:05.400 --> 02:42:11.400]  And why this is being fought so hard in the bottom line is this.
[02:42:11.400 --> 02:42:13.400]  This is part of a genocidal program.
[02:42:13.400 --> 02:42:14.400]  It's part of eugenics.
[02:42:14.400 --> 02:42:20.400]  It's part of really sculpting the DNA when we hear about, well, we're going to...
[02:42:20.400 --> 02:42:29.400]  I mean, this is what Matt or Margaret Sanger was all about in a woman that's less known, Madame Calante,
[02:42:29.400 --> 02:42:33.400]  who is a Marxist socialist, well, communist, I should say.
[02:42:33.400 --> 02:42:39.400]  She was the original champion of abortion rights back in the early 20th century.
[02:42:39.400 --> 02:42:46.400]  And when you see, when you start peeling back the layers, you see Calante's book of communism and the family.
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:52.400]  You see that what we're seeing right now is an attack on the nuclear or the traditional family or the family itself.
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:59.400]  And you can see that it's a takedown of our nation through the takedown of our family in the middle class
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:03.400]  and, of course, the constitutional rights of all people.
[02:43:03.400 --> 02:43:08.400]  People say, well, we're actually for constitutional rights via the Fourth Amendment.
[02:43:08.400 --> 02:43:10.400]  Now, that's a perversion of the Constitution.
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:14.400]  People really need to understand what's going on and who are the people who are behind it.
[02:43:14.400 --> 02:43:18.400]  And that's where I believe once that knowledge gets out there,
[02:43:18.400 --> 02:43:23.400]  and there's no putting the genie back on the bottle, we need to really push that hard in my view anyway.
[02:43:23.400 --> 02:43:25.400]  Absolutely. I agree with you, Doug.
[02:43:25.400 --> 02:43:31.400]  And, of course, we also see these pedophile rings that are being run by the most powerful elites in our country and the UK.
[02:43:31.400 --> 02:43:36.400]  We see American ambassadors caught up in this over and over again.
[02:43:36.400 --> 02:43:40.400]  It seems that these things all go hand in hand.
[02:43:40.400 --> 02:43:49.400]  The pedophile rings, the satanic cult worship, as Alex Jones went to Bohemian Grove and saw the sacrifice of care.
[02:43:49.400 --> 02:43:57.400]  I mean, the thing is basically a reenactment of a malloc sacrifice of passing their children, sacrificing their babies for prosperity.
[02:43:57.400 --> 02:44:04.400]  And certainly, that is subconsciously, at the very least, if it's not overt, if it's not direct, if it's not a conscious reference,
[02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:08.400]  it is subconsciously what they are telling people when they bring them in and say,
[02:44:08.400 --> 02:44:10.400]  I want to help you plan your family and so forth.
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:12.400]  Abby Johnson says, no, they're pushing abortions.
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:16.400]  And one of the ways that they do that is to tell you, you're not going to be able to afford these children.
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:20.400]  Do you realize how much money they're going to cost you over 20 years?
[02:44:20.400 --> 02:44:25.400]  They're selling this as a means of your own personal prosperity.
[02:44:25.400 --> 02:44:31.400]  Exactly. And this fits so well into the globalist agenda.
[02:44:31.400 --> 02:44:36.400]  People need to take a number of steps back and look at the entire picture.
[02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:45.400]  I mean, we spent a lot of time talking about the Planned Parenthood issue to understand how important that is to the greater mechanics of the globalist issue,
[02:44:45.400 --> 02:44:48.400]  in particular, the homosexual agenda.
[02:44:48.400 --> 02:44:58.400]  There is a direct link between Planned Parenthood and what they're doing in the homosexual agenda to grant rights under the Constitution that were never there in the first place,
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:13.400]  to change the Constitution. So people need to understand the vastness and the importance and really the evil nature of what we're looking at,
[02:45:13.400 --> 02:45:24.400]  whether it's Planned Parenthood or whether it's this a sensible fight for equal rights when it's not for the homosexual marriage, twisting of the family and such.
[02:45:24.400 --> 02:45:33.400]  I think there's an interesting case that came up today, was reported on WND, about some gays demanding irreversible harm to a Christian.
[02:45:33.400 --> 02:45:39.400]  And this is not a situation, this is in Kentucky. They say that it is not a question of whether or not there's going to be a Kentucky marriage license,
[02:45:39.400 --> 02:45:44.400]  whether or not there's going to be a same-sex marriage. This is not about who can marry who in Kentucky law.
[02:45:44.400 --> 02:45:50.400]  They say it's not about whether Kentucky will recognize same-sex marriage that Kentucky governor has declared that Kentucky will.
[02:45:50.400 --> 02:45:58.400]  Instead, it's about forcing an individual county clerk to authorize and personally approve same-sex marriage in violation of her fundamental religious liberties.
[02:45:58.400 --> 02:46:06.400]  They point out that Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito warned that same-sex marriage ruling that they just passed would be used to stamp out those,
[02:46:06.400 --> 02:46:10.400]  and that's his term, stamp out, those who disagree with the progressive agenda.
[02:46:10.400 --> 02:46:21.400]  And in this particular case, Doug, these plaintiffs sought a license from this particular clerk only after learning of her religious objections to same-sex marriage,
[02:46:21.400 --> 02:46:29.400]  and they refused to get a license when they could get it elsewhere. So this is about forcing you to bow to their will.
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:33.400]  It's absolute religious intolerance, and that's where I draw the line.
[02:46:33.400 --> 02:46:40.400]  When people cross over that line and say they're not content to do it on their own, but they're going to force this person to do this,
[02:46:40.400 --> 02:46:48.400]  they're going to force a baker to celebrate their marriage in violation of their religious beliefs and then get a $135,000 judgment against them.
[02:46:48.400 --> 02:46:54.400]  That's absolutely outrageous. That's over the line. Nobody should support that if they support individual rights.
[02:46:54.400 --> 02:47:00.400]  Oh, but this is just the beginning. And Alex pointed this out. I've heard you do the same thing.
[02:47:00.400 --> 02:47:10.400]  This is just the beginning. What we're witnessing here is the incremental now exponentially rapid takedown of our religious freedoms.
[02:47:10.400 --> 02:47:18.400]  And you see religious freedoms will affect our First Amendment rights, obviously, or do affect our First Amendment rights.
[02:47:18.400 --> 02:47:22.400]  Ultimately, there's a war against Christians. Look at who's in the White House.
[02:47:22.400 --> 02:47:32.400]  Look at who is really pushing this agenda from the executive level. But look at the acquiescence of the so-called conservatives in Congress.
[02:47:32.400 --> 02:47:38.400]  People think that in 2016, we're going to get somebody else in there. You get another thing coming.
[02:47:38.400 --> 02:47:45.400]  There is no, and as Steve Quill, our good friend, says, there are no political solutions to spiritual problems.
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:56.400]  We have a massive spiritual problem in addition to a massive problem with people who were infiltrated for the last generation and a half to, I mean, the last 50 plus years.
[02:47:56.400 --> 02:48:05.400]  We've had this massive infiltration of communists who are pushing a globalist agenda, or globalist pushing a communist agenda to take your pick.
[02:48:05.400 --> 02:48:18.400]  And part parcel to that is the destruction of the family, destruction of our rights, the inability, shutting us up as Christians, shutting us up as conservatives or as morally, physical conservatives.
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:29.400]  And it's to take down our country from within, and they're doing a great job of it. And you know what, if we don't stand up right now, if people don't say right now, look, you're not going to force me to bake a cake.
[02:48:29.400 --> 02:48:37.400]  You're not going to force me to act with us to your perverse standards, regardless of what they are. If we don't take a stand right now, we are going to lose our country.
[02:48:37.400 --> 02:48:44.400]  Well, we're actually losing our country, but I agree with you, David, at the beginning of the segment, you said it's not too late.
[02:48:44.400 --> 02:48:54.400]  You know, while there's still life and breath, there's still hope. And I hope that people can take this as a rallying call, get out there and say, you know what, you're not going to push me to do this.
[02:48:54.400 --> 02:48:59.400]  And I don't care. You want to find me $135,000? You can stick that over the sun, don't shine.
[02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:06.400]  Absolutely. You know, Doug, when you said that this is going to come after our First Amendment rights, we have already seen that in a case here in Houston.
[02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:16.400]  In Houston, we have an openly lesbian mayor who is married to someone who is very high up, I think, head of Planned Parenthood in that area.
[02:49:16.400 --> 02:49:26.400]  And of course, there were some conflict of interest charges about that, about money being passed back and forth between the Houston City Council, the Houston government and Planned Parenthood.
[02:49:26.400 --> 02:49:40.400]  But then they went a little bit farther. What they did in the name of legislation for transsexuals, they opened up, tried to open up ladies public restrooms and locker rooms to men who might claim that they were women.
[02:49:40.400 --> 02:49:47.400]  Now, there was pushback against this by local churches, and this is how this mayor responded.
[02:49:47.400 --> 02:49:54.400]  She demanded from five of these churches that they give her the sermons that they had preached about this, demanded that.
[02:49:54.400 --> 02:50:00.400]  So there's your attack on the First Amendment, both free speech as well as freedom of religion.
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:12.400]  It took the state Supreme Court to come in. Oh, the other thing that happened with this, Doug, was they came up, they got a signature drive set up to take back this law, and they manipulated this.
[02:50:12.400 --> 02:50:20.400]  The city secretary certified that enough signatures had been turned in, but the mayor and the city's attorney manipulated the results to avoid having a popular vote.
[02:50:20.400 --> 02:50:27.400]  So this whole thing went to the Texas Supreme Court. They said, you are either going to repeal this ordinance or you will put it up to a vote.
[02:50:27.400 --> 02:50:32.400]  So at least in this particular case, that has been stood down, but look at the tyranny between that.
[02:50:32.400 --> 02:50:35.400]  The First Amendment, both aspects of the First Amendment.
[02:50:35.400 --> 02:50:42.400]  We're going to take a break and we're going to come back with Doug Hagman of Hagman and Hagman, and a new article up on Infowars.com.
[02:50:42.400 --> 02:50:58.400]  Obama speaks out against Oregon harvesting of African albinoes only. We'll be right back.
[02:50:58.400 --> 02:51:07.400]  Okay, honey, I have to ask and be honest here, have you been taking a little blue pill because things have been pretty good in the bedroom lately?
[02:51:07.400 --> 02:51:09.400]  No, I swear.
[02:51:09.400 --> 02:51:13.400]  You didn't pick anything up at the pharmacy last month in Cancun?
[02:51:13.400 --> 02:51:14.400]  No.
[02:51:14.400 --> 02:51:15.400]  Well, something's different.
[02:51:15.400 --> 02:51:18.400]  I have been taking that heart and body extract you bought me.
[02:51:18.400 --> 02:51:21.400]  But that's for your heart and to control your cholesterol.
[02:51:21.400 --> 02:51:24.400]  Well, I read HB Extract also promotes healthy prostate function.
[02:51:24.400 --> 02:51:26.400]  I never guessed it would work this well, but...
[02:51:26.400 --> 02:51:28.400]  But you're glad it did.
[02:51:28.400 --> 02:51:29.400]  Oh, yeah.
[02:51:29.400 --> 02:51:41.400]  Heart and body extract is a 100% organic formula that promotes a strong heart, healthy arterial flow, better circulation, improves erectile and prostate gland function, and provides youthful energy, strength and stamina.

[02:52:00.400 --> 02:52:08.400]  Thousands of people seeking home security get ripped off every day, and the home security industry wants you to believe that's your only option.

[02:54:24.400 --> 02:54:35.400]  We've also been talking about the satanic connections to it as well.
[02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:40.400]  And this story just broke Doug on Infowars.com from Mikhail Thelon.
[02:54:40.400 --> 02:54:44.400]  Obama speaks out against organ harvesting of African albinos.
[02:54:44.400 --> 02:54:45.400]  This is what he has to say.
[02:54:45.400 --> 02:54:50.400]  People with albinism in Africa are being killed and their body parts harvested for ritual purposes.
[02:54:50.400 --> 02:54:58.400]  My request to you is to raise this issue with the heads of state of African countries to bring the atrocities to an end.
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:54:59.400]  They call the tradition foolish.
[02:54:59.400 --> 02:55:00.400]  He said it's infuriating.
[02:55:00.400 --> 02:55:02.400]  I have no patience for it.
[02:55:02.400 --> 02:55:03.400]  And then he says this.
[02:55:03.400 --> 02:55:12.400]  The notion that any African would discriminate against somebody because of the color of their skin after what black people around the world have gone through is crazy.
[02:55:12.400 --> 02:55:16.400]  Well, let's explain something to Obama.
[02:55:16.400 --> 02:55:23.400]  There's a far greater proportion of black babies that are aborted at Planned Parenthood than any other group.
[02:55:23.400 --> 02:55:32.400]  And if you want to get upset about the fact that these organs are being harvested because these people are suffering from albinism.
[02:55:32.400 --> 02:55:36.400]  All these babies are the same on the inside.
[02:55:36.400 --> 02:55:45.400]  All these babies that are being killed and chopped up and having their body parts sold for profit by Planned Parenthood are all the same on the inside.
[02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:49.400]  We could care less about the skin, at least we think.
[02:55:49.400 --> 02:55:51.400]  They certainly don't care about the color of the skin.
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:53.400]  Your comments, Doug.
[02:55:53.400 --> 02:55:58.400]  Well, obviously Obama needs a refresher in history.
[02:55:58.400 --> 02:56:12.400]  Well, Planned Parenthood, the abortion, the entire abortion industry was built upon the eradication of blacks from the population.
[02:56:12.400 --> 02:56:13.400]  Absolutely.
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:15.400]  I mean, that's the bottom line.
[02:56:15.400 --> 02:56:28.400]  So for him to make a ridiculous statement like that tells me that he's either so far out of the loop historically or is so deceitful that I don't know.
[02:56:28.400 --> 02:56:29.400]  Is he believing his own lies?
[02:56:29.400 --> 02:56:30.400]  But the bottom line is this.
[02:56:30.400 --> 02:56:31.400]  You're absolutely right.
[02:56:31.400 --> 02:56:33.400]  We're talking about a human life here.
[02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:38.400]  We're not talking about an albino tissue sample or anything like that.
[02:56:38.400 --> 02:56:49.400]  We're talking about a human life and people better understand that abortion on demand, abortion is the number one killer of all the things in our nation.
[02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:50.400]  Yes.
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:58.400]  And, you know, so with respect to the article that you broke, and that's a very interesting article, and I certainly would urge people to really read that.
[02:56:58.400 --> 02:57:07.400]  Bottom line here is the organ harvesting of African albinos, as I see on your screen there.
[02:57:07.400 --> 02:57:10.400]  That's happening here in this country for crying out loud.
[02:57:10.400 --> 02:57:18.400]  Don't be naive to think that the organs that are being harvested for ceremonial ritualistic purposes, it does happen.
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:27.400]  It's unpleasant to talk about, but you'll find documentation buried among many accounts where this does is proven to be the case.
[02:57:27.400 --> 02:57:34.400]  And when we can make some money on the unborn body parts as they're doing right now, boy, that's even better.
[02:57:34.400 --> 02:57:42.400]  He looks at this, he strains it this little night because, you know, this is not to minimize this, but this is such a small number of people.
[02:57:42.400 --> 02:57:49.400]  As you're pointing out, the number of people aborted is the largest form of murder that we've got going on, mass murder that we've got going on right now.
[02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:58.400]  So he takes a very narrow segment of this and speaks out an outrage, ironically, about organ harvesting, ironically, about Africans.
[02:57:58.400 --> 02:58:03.400]  When it is African Americans that this whole organization was set up to target.
[02:58:03.400 --> 02:58:04.400]  Exactly.
[02:58:04.400 --> 02:58:05.400]  Absolutely amazing.
[02:58:05.400 --> 02:58:12.400]  And the disabled and those of a certain type of race or, you know, yeah, I get that.
[02:58:12.400 --> 02:58:13.400]  Boy, I'll tell you.
[02:58:13.400 --> 02:58:15.400]  Well, thank you for joining us again.
