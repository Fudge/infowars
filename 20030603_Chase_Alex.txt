[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080]  Staying in an anemone, they've already been in some news articles, but we're not going to tell
[00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.320]  you their names because they don't want to. I think it's frankly safer to come out and stand up, but
[00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.720]  they're standing up more than most folks here on the air. There are thousands of these cases that
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.480]  we see every year in the mainstream news. This is just one of them. Dr. Sarah Case is a chiropractor.
[00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.960]  We have the mother and grandmother and later, because we can't have four people online at one
[00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.000]  time, I don't think anybody can, we're going to have the father on. They wanted to have a home
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.200]  birth. I'm just going to recap things. I heard this on Joyce's show today.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.760]  Just to recap the story, and I've also seen this in the news, the story a few months ago when this
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.200]  happened. Just to recap the story briefly. They can tell me if I'm wrong at any point.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.600]  I want to tell you that you're much safer in a home birth if you have a midwife statistically,
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.840]  but then in a rare case, you do have a problem. You've got to go to the hospital.
[00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:01.600]  The baby was too big. They get to the hospital. They tell them, we don't want any vaccinations.
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.160]  They act like that's weird. They won't sign for a social security number, which I didn't get mine
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.360]  until I was like 14. Why do they want it at birth now? They freak out over that. Suddenly they say,
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.600]  this test says you've got hepatitis. When it was a test that 40% of the time is inaccurate,
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.160]  just a quick smear test. Later turned out she didn't have hepatitis. They said,
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.560]  we've got to vaccinate your baby now for hepatitis B. They called in a kangaroo court
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.000]  with a bioethicist. They had a staged event, forcibly injected the child, took the child away,
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.760]  injected it, gave it back to him. The social worker said, if you don't give them the other
[00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.960]  shots next week when you're supposed to get it two months later. I've had this hepatitis shot
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.040]  because I worked in the medical field in college. I know about it. You get it two months later,
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.880]  three shots. They said, you take it next week or we're going to take your child.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.920]  They then got the information that they didn't have hepatitis. It was made up.
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.720]  And I think they should sue. They've got a major lawsuit. Their civil rights,
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.480]  their God given rights, their constitutional first amendment right to practice religion
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.960]  has been violated. But this is a family that knew what they were doing and still got caught
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.800]  in the clutches. Dr. Sarah Chase and also the mother and grandmother who were under attack
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.000]  and they are patriots. They are, they know about the new world order. Welcome to the airwaves. Did
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.080]  I in a nutshell recap what happened accurately? Yes, you did. Thank you so much for having us
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.680]  on Alex. This is Dr. Chase. I do need to correct just a few minor things. The baby wasn't too big.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.240]  The baby was in good shape, good size and everything. The problem with the home birth
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.520]  is that the baby went transverse and the child cannot be delivered in the transverse. That's
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:44.480]  face first? It was transverse. Sideways? It was sideways instead of in the down position.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.800]  Most of the time with natural intervention methods we can get the baby to turn.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.280]  This was one of those rare instances where we could not get the baby to turn so the mother had.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.280]  I know you've been involved in these. For those that don't know, I've investigated it. We've had
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.520]  guests on. I've even read the mainstream news. Statistically home births are safer.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.320]  Oh, so much more. That's because of the hormones they use, the shots they give,
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.520]  the just bad medical care. Yes, and I will have to say most women that say, oh, I'm so glad I
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.240]  went to the hospital because of this, this or that. Most of those things that happened were
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:21.760]  because of medical intervention. If they were involved in a home birth with a good midwife and
[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.040]  hopefully a chiropractor at hand, that wouldn't have happened. I recommend people have their
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:32.560]  babies at home for health reasons and also because of what hospitals are doing as an
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.440]  arm of the government. They're also trying to shut down midwives now nationwide,
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.680]  which have been around longer than doctors. Yes. Now, why is it in third world countries,
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.800]  and even third world Eastern European white countries, it's not just a thing of color,
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.800]  why can women have a baby in an average of six hours, but in the US the average is now 18 hours?
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:00.720]  Why is that? I think part of it is the state of our health. So many people's health is that they're
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.160]  not taking care of themselves, but also the medical intervention. So often they're inducing
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.360]  the labor and people are out of shape. They're not exercising. They're scared. They're led to
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.840]  believe that a birth is a medical process rather than a natural process. If the babies and mothers
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.760]  were just left alone, the baby would come on its own time of its own choosing. Well, I had a friend
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.600]  in high school whose mother was a doctor and in one of the rooms is an antique, they had a Swedish
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.440]  birthing chair, and they said in Sweden, a woman's squatting, I don't want to get into
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:42.000]  too many details, but have a baby in an average of two and a half hours. That's common. That's
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.080]  common. Well, why does it take 18 on average now? Well, it also depends on what we're talking about.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:53.520]  Once the water breaks, oftentimes the baby normally naturally will come within a few hours,
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.400]  but before the water breaks, how long has that woman been having labor pains that actually could
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:03.280]  be for days? I'm not talking about hard labor. Once the water breaks, the woman will go into much
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:10.000]  harder labor, but it's not uncommon for a woman to have labor pains for several days. But it just
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.160]  seems like gravity, that the old fashioned way they did it in the Bible, it seems like with
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:21.520]  gravity that that would be the sensible way to do it. It certainly makes sense to me, Alex,
[00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:27.920]  when they lay these women on their backs and they're pushing against gravity and it causes
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.840]  so much more back pain and it's so much more difficult for the baby, of course, it's going
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.280]  to take longer. The way that they birth babies in hospitals, not in the birthing centers,
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:43.840]  but in the regular hospital medical rooms, in my opinion, it's horrible. Well, people can't
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:48.880]  defeat the statistics and that's a fact if you check it out. So what happened
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:56.320]  again in this case and are you guys going to sue these people? The family is pursuing legal remedy
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.520]  because they feel, I'll let them tell you all this, but they feel it's a moral and
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.320]  ethical obligation to not let such tyrannical tactics go unnoticed. Well, it's the state saying
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:11.600]  they own your kids and it's basically kidnapping. Right. Well, let's bring the grandmother up
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.200]  exactly, and we'll just call her grandmother Mary, exactly what happened and what has this
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.720]  been like for your family? We'll bring the mother up as well and thank you for your courage coming
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:32.320]  on the show. Thank you. Thank you. I'm Mary. It was a nightmare for us. My daughter needed help
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:37.520]  and the baby was transverse, couldn't be born in a transverse position. We recognized that.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:45.760]  We took her to the hospital and when we got there, a doctor met us. We had called ahead
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:52.080]  and a doctor had met us and he said, I know you think we're the enemy, but I'm not here to get
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:07:00.480]  rich off of you. I have an office full of patients and I'm not here to get rich on you. The attending
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.720]  nurse, I thought this was a strange comment, the attending nurse turned to the doctor and smiled
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:12.880]  and said, no, we don't want your money. We just want your firstborn. And that was our introduction
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:17.360]  to the hospital. Oh, that didn't come out this earlier today. Oh, how nice. Did you know that
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:22.240]  I've covered this in Austin and when you go to one of the city hospitals, in some weeks, the average
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:26.240]  is one third of the kids are being grabbed. If you're poor, don't know your rights, they come in
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:31.280]  with police. We have this on video. We've aired it on TV in Austin. They say, sign these documents
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:38.880]  now. The mother cries, signs the documents and they never see the kid again. So she told you,
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.360]  this nurse said, now that's cruel and unusual. That was vicious. That shows premeditated
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.520]  activity. This nurse said, we just want your firstborn. We don't want your money. We just want
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:59.120]  your firstborn. And it was somewhat riveting, but I blew it off. I thought, okay, bad joke.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:05.360]  But then in light of what happened, looking back at that, I think it's quite telling. I've heard
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:09.600]  the tactic. I don't know about this hospital, but that's how they, in some of the other cases,
[00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:14.400]  they will claim, oh, the mommy had a hepatitis thing. We got to keep the baby for observation.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.960]  They take them in a neonatal and there's no problem with them. Then they use that to freeze
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:23.440]  things to get the order to take the child. Of course, it turned out that your daughter,
[00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.760]  and she's on with us now, did not have hepatitis, totally off this little test.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.480]  We knew that from the beginning. She wasn't even at risk.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.800]  So they do this now, starting to look premeditated.
[00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.680]  Well, it makes you wonder. It makes one wonder. The doctor did the C-section.
[00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:51.680]  The baby was taken to intensive care unit to monitor the baby. They kept the baby there.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:57.280]  They didn't release the baby till two days later. Well, actually that evening. It was getting close
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:01.680]  to midnight. Did the baby look like a pin cushion by the time they were done with it?
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:11.360]  They poked the baby a lot. They took a lot of blood samples. It was not fun,
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.720]  but they made the blood sugar an issue. I talked to a pediatrician that was-
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:21.120]  That's because the child wasn't nursed. It was immediately put on the breast. The milk would flow,
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:24.560]  the colostrum, and the bed. Of course, after labor and the stress of that,
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.880]  I looked at the old statistics we've had guests on about this. Of course, the blood sugar is low
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.560]  in most children at birth. Now they consider what a 45 level, which was average just 30 years ago,
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:37.200]  they consider that as low, correct? Is that what it is?
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:39.600]  The criterion was 50. The baby was nursing.
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.100]  50?
[00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:40.800]  Yeah, the baby-
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.560]  The criteria was 50?
[00:09:42.560 --> 00:09:43.440]  That's right.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:45.360]  Oh man, that's a major scam.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:51.520]  Right. The baby was nursing. The baby was nursing well until they forced the vaccination.
[00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:58.560]  Then the oxygen levels went down. They had a criterion for oxygen.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.960]  That's listed as one of the most dangerous vaccines, even on the insert, correct, doctor?
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:11.840]  Oh, yes. We knew that, especially for newborns whose immune systems are not fully developed.
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:19.840]  The last day the baby was there, they were holding the baby because blood sugar would not meet the
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:26.640]  50 criterion. My daughter was so exhausted. We were trying to get her a little bit of rest.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:35.040]  The whole experience was a nightmare for her. They kept coming in, having her sign papers.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.360]  She signed the papers?
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.640]  There were papers that she did not sign.
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.040]  Yeah, these are wolves. Now in the predatory world, I'm going to point this out. The government
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:50.800]  does this. The old, the young, the infirm, the sick. This is what wolves do, or hyena.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:57.840]  On the African plain, wild dogs, lions, they target other mammals when they're down on their
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:02.640]  backs or when they're down on their sides. That's when they attack. In the same way here,
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:08.880]  with a new world order, vicious attacks, with CPS, when the family is most exhausted.
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:12.400]  Well, it was exhausting. My daughter was-
[00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:16.720]  My hyenas. What did you do as you're surrounded by them, banging at you?
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:23.120]  Yeah. Well, they walked in. They told her she had hepatitis B. They felt, my goodness, that
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:29.760]  she felt as if that was a death sentence. They said, we've got to vaccinate your baby. You have
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.200]  hepatitis B. When in fact, all they had was a screening test.
[00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:37.680]  And you got the medical report. You got the medical report. Again, folks,
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.040]  I work in dentist offices, hospitals. There's a large animal that I know about this stuff.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.840]  I've sat there and watched the test done. They know that test is 40% wrong. And he told
[00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.760]  your daughter she had hepatitis. That is emotional damages right there.
[00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:54.640]  This was not even her doctor that told her that she had hepatitis B.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:58.880]  Was it the pediatrician? This was a neonatologist who was in charge
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.480]  of the neonatology- Hospital pediatrician. Stay there. We'll be
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.440]  right back. Okay.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:07.520]  And expose the death camps.
[00:12:07.739 --> 00:12:18.739]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show, because there's
[00:12:18.739 --> 00:12:19.739]  a war on for your mind.
[00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:20.739]  We know you're paranoid about hospitals.
[00:12:20.739 --> 00:12:21.739]  Don't worry.
[00:12:21.739 --> 00:12:22.739]  We don't want your money.
[00:12:22.739 --> 00:12:23.739]  We just want your firstborn, is what we told them.
[00:12:23.739 --> 00:12:35.739]  Here in Austin, we've done TV shows, folks, where poor people, no criminal records, done
[00:12:35.739 --> 00:12:41.739]  nothing wrong, show up, CPS walks in and says to them, oh, what do you do?
[00:12:41.739 --> 00:12:45.739]  Well, I'm a maid and my husband is a construction worker.
[00:12:45.739 --> 00:12:47.739]  Well, how are you going to take care of this baby?
[00:12:47.739 --> 00:12:48.739]  Well, here, just sign here.
[00:12:48.739 --> 00:12:50.739]  They don't even tell them what it means.
[00:12:50.739 --> 00:12:51.739]  We've been there with cameras.
[00:12:51.739 --> 00:12:52.739]  This police are telling them to stand back.
[00:12:52.739 --> 00:12:53.739]  And the mother's crying.
[00:12:53.739 --> 00:12:56.739]  And the officer grabs one by the arm and says, sign it.
[00:12:56.739 --> 00:12:59.739]  And they go, sign it.
[00:12:59.739 --> 00:13:01.739]  And they take the child and laugh.
[00:13:01.739 --> 00:13:02.739]  We have video.
[00:13:02.739 --> 00:13:03.739]  We've aired this in Austin.
[00:13:03.739 --> 00:13:05.739]  It just horrifies people.
[00:13:05.739 --> 00:13:12.739]  This is a middle class family, young parents with good parents and grandparents with doctors
[00:13:12.739 --> 00:13:14.739]  who are in the family.
[00:13:14.739 --> 00:13:16.739]  Sarah Chase is a member of the family.
[00:13:16.739 --> 00:13:18.739]  It's her sister's daughter.
[00:13:18.739 --> 00:13:20.739]  And this is how they operate.
[00:13:20.739 --> 00:13:21.739]  This is what they do.
[00:13:21.739 --> 00:13:23.739]  I want you to know.
[00:13:23.739 --> 00:13:25.739]  And going along with them won't help you.
[00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:30.739]  The brain damage, the disease, the attack, the IQ reduction by the military industrial
[00:13:30.739 --> 00:13:31.739]  complex is public.
[00:13:31.739 --> 00:13:37.739]  We have Henry Kissinger's plan on Infowars.com, a national security document public where
[00:13:37.739 --> 00:13:42.739]  they say they want to sterilize half the women in the world at birth through different systems.
[00:13:42.739 --> 00:13:44.739]  And the baby girls are really in trouble.
[00:13:44.739 --> 00:13:46.739]  And the doctors, of course, don't know.
[00:13:46.739 --> 00:13:47.739]  They think it's all good.
[00:13:47.739 --> 00:13:52.739]  And they're following good orders because they're not the ones manufacturing these vaccines.
[00:13:52.739 --> 00:13:54.739]  And the AMA does a good job of keeping this all quiet.
[00:13:54.739 --> 00:14:00.739]  But now the head of the medical school of Chicago up in Illinois has gone public about
[00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:02.739]  how dangerous the vaccines are.
[00:14:02.739 --> 00:14:07.739]  Going back to Sarah Chase, the doctor, the family member, the grandmother, the mother,
[00:14:07.739 --> 00:14:09.739]  and the father, Michael, are joining us.
[00:14:09.739 --> 00:14:11.739]  We're about to end this hour.
[00:14:11.739 --> 00:14:12.739]  I want to hold you over.
[00:14:12.739 --> 00:14:17.739]  But any other key areas you want to hit on about how – I remember you said this morning
[00:14:17.739 --> 00:14:21.739]  when you were on the Joyce and Dave Show that you're sitting there and they call this
[00:14:21.739 --> 00:14:22.739]  hearing that night.
[00:14:22.739 --> 00:14:25.739]  Don't tell you about it until you were calling around looking for lawyers.
[00:14:25.739 --> 00:14:26.739]  And you call a lawyer's office.
[00:14:26.739 --> 00:14:28.739]  They go, oh, we're already there having the hearing.
[00:14:28.739 --> 00:14:31.739]  You run up to it and they say, why isn't the mother here?
[00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:35.739]  Doesn't she care when she just had a C-section and couldn't even get out of bed?
[00:14:35.739 --> 00:14:38.739]  Can you talk about any other key areas for us?
[00:14:38.739 --> 00:14:40.739]  Whoever wants to jump in.
[00:14:40.739 --> 00:14:42.739]  Well, this is Dr. Chase.
[00:14:42.739 --> 00:14:44.739]  I'll be real brief so the others can talk.
[00:14:44.739 --> 00:14:47.739]  But the family was given less than an hour's notice.
[00:14:47.739 --> 00:14:49.739]  This was held after hours.
[00:14:49.739 --> 00:14:53.739]  The family had no chance of getting competent legal help or expert witnesses.
[00:14:53.739 --> 00:14:56.739]  We demanded to know why this was happening that night.
[00:14:56.739 --> 00:14:58.739]  They said it was a medical emergency.
[00:14:58.739 --> 00:15:00.739]  Now, mind you, the child's life was not in danger.
[00:15:00.739 --> 00:15:01.739]  The child wasn't bleeding.
[00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:03.739]  The child was doing well.
[00:15:03.739 --> 00:15:05.739]  And it went on for three hours.
[00:15:05.739 --> 00:15:10.739]  And when I challenged the jurisdiction, I did it probably way too late.
[00:15:10.739 --> 00:15:12.739]  But I asked the judge, what right do you have to do this?
[00:15:12.739 --> 00:15:14.739]  You know, you have no jurisdiction over this family.
[00:15:14.739 --> 00:15:17.739]  And he said the child's here in the hospital.
[00:15:17.739 --> 00:15:22.739]  So when you take your child into a hospital, they claim jurisdiction over it.
[00:15:22.739 --> 00:15:24.739]  So it's a very dangerous place to be.
[00:15:24.739 --> 00:15:29.739]  Well, also I would add a caveat to this entire discussion,
[00:15:29.739 --> 00:15:36.739]  that if they recommended that you take the next shot in a week or you'd be arrested,
[00:15:36.739 --> 00:15:41.739]  even the insert says, because I've read it, that that is dangerous for the hepatitis B shot
[00:15:41.739 --> 00:15:45.739]  and that you shouldn't do it until at least a month and a half to two months.
[00:15:45.739 --> 00:15:48.739]  So they were recommending that.
[00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:51.739]  That right there is malpractice.
[00:15:51.739 --> 00:15:54.739]  That was going against recommended protocol.
[00:15:54.739 --> 00:15:59.739]  The Centers for Disease Control hotline was called in the Department of Health and Human Services.
[00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:01.739]  And we asked about that.
[00:16:01.739 --> 00:16:06.739]  Even if we had chosen to give that shot on our own,
[00:16:06.739 --> 00:16:16.739]  the protocol that the CDC recommends is at birth and then no sooner than one to two months after.
[00:16:16.739 --> 00:16:20.739]  And they said if it was given any sooner, the child's life would certainly be in danger.
[00:16:20.739 --> 00:16:22.739]  Yeah, they violated AMA.
[00:16:22.739 --> 00:16:26.739]  I would hit them on that point and then I would hit them on the threats,
[00:16:26.739 --> 00:16:30.739]  the oh, we only want your first born, showing poor knowledge and racketeering.
[00:16:30.739 --> 00:16:32.739]  And do not labor.
[00:16:32.739 --> 00:16:35.739]  They all need to lose their houses, everything they've got.
[00:16:35.739 --> 00:16:38.739]  Well, there's another point.
[00:16:38.739 --> 00:16:41.739]  Tell us the name of the hospital, too, before we end this hour.
[00:16:41.739 --> 00:16:42.739]  St. Mary's Hospital.
[00:16:42.739 --> 00:16:43.739]  What hospital?
[00:16:43.739 --> 00:16:45.739]  St. Mary's Hospital in Grand Junction, Colorado.
[00:16:45.739 --> 00:16:46.739]  That's right.
[00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:47.739]  Grand Junction, Colorado.
[00:16:47.739 --> 00:16:52.739]  I wanted that for all our Colorado audiences on our four affiliates there before we aren't with them.
[00:16:52.739 --> 00:16:54.739]  They don't carry the third hour.
[00:16:54.739 --> 00:16:57.739]  Well, the social worker at the hospital.
[00:16:57.739 --> 00:16:58.739]  Say what?
[00:16:58.739 --> 00:16:59.739]  Stay there.
[00:16:59.739 --> 00:17:00.739]  We'll hear it on the other side.
[00:17:00.739 --> 00:17:03.739]  We'll be right back.
[00:17:03.739 --> 00:17:06.739]  Introducing the best air purifier in the world, the Aeronite.
[00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:17.139]  Thanks for listening to the M2K talk archives and we are listener supported with the honors
[00:17:17.139 --> 00:17:18.139]  system.
[00:17:18.139 --> 00:17:24.780]  We ask that you wait, don't donate a dollar at a time, PayPal charges a 35 cent surcharge
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.139]  on anything of a dollar or less.
[00:17:27.139 --> 00:17:30.580]  Wait till you listen to five or ten and then donate please.
[00:17:30.620 --> 00:17:33.620]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:44.620]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups, you want answers?
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:46.620]  Well so does he.
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:55.620]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:17:55.659 --> 00:18:01.659]  All right ladies and gentlemen, welcome back or into the third to final hour of this worldwide
[00:18:01.659 --> 00:18:02.659]  edition.
[00:18:02.659 --> 00:18:06.659]  I'm here Monday through Friday from 11 to 2 central, 11 to 2 central during the day
[00:18:06.659 --> 00:18:11.659]  and then back from 9 to midnight central standard time, that's 10 pm to 1 am.
[00:18:11.659 --> 00:18:17.659]  Websites are Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.net.
[00:18:17.699 --> 00:18:25.699]  And we're talking to Dr. Sarah Chase who is the sister, her sister is the mother of the
[00:18:25.699 --> 00:18:29.699]  19 year old young lady and her husband who wanted to have natural childbirth, went ahead
[00:18:29.699 --> 00:18:31.699]  and went to the hospital.
[00:18:31.699 --> 00:18:34.699]  They claimed that the mother had hepatitis, told her she had it when they knew the test
[00:18:34.699 --> 00:18:37.699]  was 40 percent inaccurate, false positive.
[00:18:37.699 --> 00:18:41.699]  Then they said you'll have to take the hepatitis shot now and forced it and then said you'll
[00:18:41.699 --> 00:18:44.699]  have to take it again in a week or we'll take your child and they say don't take it for
[00:18:44.699 --> 00:18:46.699]  at least a month and a half or two months.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:50.740]  That's the own guidelines from the insert, just out of control.
[00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:54.740]  They also told them up front don't worry, we don't want your money, we just want your
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:55.740]  firstborn.
[00:18:55.740 --> 00:19:00.740]  It's real funny, the sick power trips these control freaks and witch doctors get on.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:04.740]  This is a massive crisis because this is a family that knew what they were doing and
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.740]  was middle class.
[00:19:05.740 --> 00:19:06.740]  Imagine being working class.
[00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:07.740]  Imagine being blue collar.
[00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:10.740]  It is a nightmare.
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:12.740]  So we were discussing the things they went through.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:14.740]  We'll have them all with us about another 20 minutes if they can stay with us and I'll
[00:19:14.780 --> 00:19:19.780]  get into other international and national news that believe me you don't want to miss.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:23.780]  Dr. Sarah Chase and we were just talking to the grandmother, the mother and the husband
[00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:25.780]  who we haven't heard from yet, the father.
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:30.780]  I believe the grandmother Mary was trying to say something about the social workers.
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.780]  Any other disgusting things they said or the nurses said other than talking about how they
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:36.780]  wanted your child?
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:42.780]  Well I think the mom should speak to that because this was told directly to her and
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:43.780]  her husband.
[00:19:43.820 --> 00:19:45.820]  Okay, let's talk to the mother again.
[00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:46.820]  Go ahead.
[00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:47.820]  All right.
[00:19:47.820 --> 00:19:53.820]  I was laying in the recovery bed or whatever it was and a social worker came in and well
[00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.820]  my husband and I had already said that we had a conviction against vaccinations and
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:04.820]  we did not want vaccinations to be given and she came in and said that she wanted us to
[00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.820]  sign all these papers for getting the vaccines.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:13.860]  She said if you don't sign these we're going to take your child or you could simply lose
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.860]  your child over this and she went into all sorts of other things that we had no business
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.860]  having a midwife and no business having a home birth.
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:27.860]  None of this is illegal and statistics show midwives have a better success rate than the
[00:20:27.860 --> 00:20:28.860]  hospitals.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:29.860]  Yeah, that's true.
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.860]  It was basically a whole scare tactic of what she was trying to do.
[00:20:34.899 --> 00:20:41.899]  They told me I had hepatitis B and they were going to do all these things that we didn't
[00:20:41.899 --> 00:20:45.899]  want done and then they were going to take our child and after everything I advanced
[00:20:45.899 --> 00:20:48.899]  through it was very unrestful and definitely scary.
[00:20:48.899 --> 00:20:52.899]  You just had a child, you've got a cesarean section cut.
[00:20:52.899 --> 00:20:53.899]  Right.
[00:20:55.899 --> 00:20:58.899]  What would you say to this greebling creature?
[00:20:58.939 --> 00:21:06.939]  Well, there were several different things we tried to say and she was just somewhat
[00:21:06.939 --> 00:21:13.939]  just nasty and said we basically had no idea what we were doing and we're incompetent parents.
[00:21:13.939 --> 00:21:18.939]  Did you say, hey, social workers and their foster homes are five times more likely to
[00:21:18.939 --> 00:21:20.939]  abuse or kill children.
[00:21:20.939 --> 00:21:24.939]  How about we have you arrested just to say that because statistically you're worse,
[00:21:24.939 --> 00:21:27.939]  let's just go ahead and say you're guilty and arrest you.
[00:21:27.980 --> 00:21:30.980]  We basically told them that.
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:35.980]  We're talking to the father, did you say that?
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:41.980]  Yeah, we basically told them that our first and foremost concern was our child and that
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.980]  as the parents we had to make the decisions we thought were best for the child and that
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:50.980]  they could threaten us with custody issues if they wanted to but we were not going to
[00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:52.980]  give our permission for them to vaccinate the baby.
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.020]  You didn't cave, sir, and I want to commend you.
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:22:01.020]  Usually in that stack of forms is a system where you relinquish your child.
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:05.020]  Did she ever put one of those in front of you?
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:11.020]  Not that I know of but they were trying to get the waivers so that they could give the
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:15.020]  shot without getting into any liability.
[00:22:15.020 --> 00:22:20.020]  Also this morning I heard that the social worker did bring forward in the little hangar
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:25.060]  the court to terminate and to take the child, correct?
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:30.060]  They took and actually supposedly granted protective custody of the child,
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:32.060]  the Department of Human Services.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.060]  Stay there, we'll be right back.
[00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:42.590]  He's the T-Rex of political talk. Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:50.590]  Alright folks, we've got about 51 minutes left in the live broadcast for stations that carry the news in the last segment.
[00:22:50.590 --> 00:23:02.590]  Talking to Dr. Sarah Chase. Her sister is the mother of the young lady, 19-year-old, who is married and who did not want her child vaccinated.
[00:23:02.590 --> 00:23:13.590]  Very intelligent, articulate people. And CPS went up and actually got their parental rights from brief period terminated for the forced injection.
[00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:21.590]  They then gave the baby the shot, the hepatitis shot you're not supposed to give, except for two months spaces.
[00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:27.590]  They said we wanted to be given the shot in seven days, which again the insert says don't do that and it's very dangerous.
[00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:34.590]  The CDC says don't do that. So that right there is a big place to have that on the record with witnesses.
[00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:40.590]  A large point to sue these people personally. They'll claim immunity. They don't have immunity. That's a con job.
[00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:51.590]  And the threats are continuing. So we're talking to the father as well. Michael, you were trying to say something about what happened to your child. Please continue.
[00:23:51.590 --> 00:23:58.590]  Oh, it was just about the custody issue that, yes, the judge did order the county to file.
[00:23:58.590 --> 00:24:03.590]  Basically they took protective custody of the child for a period of about three weeks.
[00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:09.590]  Thankfully we were able to avoid getting the second shot, which could have probably killed our child.
[00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:20.590]  But we did go through three weeks of basically terror where we had physical custody of our child, but they had the right to do whatever they wanted.
[00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:26.590]  And they were saying take the shot in seven days and we're going to take your child. They claimed your wife had hepatitis B.
[00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:32.590]  Heard out of course she didn't. We've caught them in other areas doing this. I don't know if this was on purpose in their case.
[00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:39.590]  But the comment to your wife, we don't want your money, we just want your firstborn. What was that like? Did you witness that?
[00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:42.590]  I didn't personally witness that.
[00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:50.590]  I want to talk to your wife. What did the nurse say? Or did the grandmother see this? What setting did this take place in? What happened?
[00:24:50.590 --> 00:25:00.590]  It was right when I was rushed into the hospital. We were trying to figure out what emergency procedure, whatever they were going to do.
[00:25:00.590 --> 00:25:16.590]  For me, I was not really the one who caught it. It was more my mother. I was kind of focused on all my breathing and labor pains and all this other stuff.
[00:25:16.590 --> 00:25:23.590]  I understand. I want to recap that. Let's bring your mother or your grandmother back up. What exactly did this nurse say?
[00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:31.590]  She smiled and said, we don't want your money, we just want your firstborn.
[00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:43.590]  Now, when the CPS person is saying, take all the shots, we're going to take your kids, sign these papers, did anybody point out that even Time Magazine had this headline a few years ago,
[00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:51.590]  five times more likely to be abused or to die in their custody, did anybody point that out, that hey, you guys have the bad track record?
[00:25:51.590 --> 00:26:00.590]  We didn't. We weren't aware of that exact statistic, but we definitely did not want our child falling into their hands because we've heard the horror story.
[00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:14.590]  They knew too much. They knew they could not let that happen, yet they also knew that they could not consent to their daughter being vaccinated.
[00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:16.590]  Is this Dr. Chase?
[00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:17.590]  This is the mother.
[00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:21.590]  Oh, this is the mother. We've got a lot of folks on here. Dr. Chase, do you have any comments to all this?
[00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:30.590]  Yes, when the nurse said, we just want your child, I thought over our dead bodies you'll take that child,
[00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:43.590]  but the courts wanted to maintain protective supervision of the child, maintaining that obviously they think they have more of a right to our children than the parents do.
[00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:51.590]  Now, and of course it's for their best interest as usual, Hitler said that, so they are running around now afterwards.
[00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:58.590]  You brought them the blood test and their own blood test saying she didn't have hepatitis B. What did they say to that?
[00:26:58.590 --> 00:27:04.590]  Well, we got social services to at least petition to the courts to drop the dependency and neglect charge,
[00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:09.590]  and we told them we were not going to get that second vaccination, especially in a week.
[00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.590]  The court documents...
[00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:19.590]  Man, I wish you would have recorded them telling you that no, you've got to take it in a week, you've got to take it in a week.
[00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.590]  You would have them so red-handed.
[00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:23.590]  Oh, it's in the court documents.
[00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:27.590]  Practicing medicine without a license. Oh, this is incredible.
[00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:29.590]  It's in the court documents.
[00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:32.590]  You're telling me they said that in the court?
[00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:34.590]  Yes, it says in the court...
[00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.590]  Oh, my.
[00:27:36.590 --> 00:27:38.590]  It's actually in the court order.
[00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:44.590]  It says in the court order that the second vaccination has to be done in one week, and it also said...
[00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:47.590]  So now the judge is practicing medicine.
[00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:56.590]  Oh, and they also said, quote, we hereby find by clear and convincing evidence that the mother has been diagnosed with hepatitis B.
[00:27:56.590 --> 00:28:00.590]  She was never examined by any doctor for hepatitis B.
[00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:06.590]  And the test says it's just a quick test, a little kit, 40% of all is positive.
[00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:11.590]  Yes, they're making a diagnosis off of an erroneous screening test.
[00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:19.590]  We have been trying for weeks to get copies of the transcripts of that court hearing, and we have been blocked from that.
[00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:21.590]  We have not even been able to get the transcripts.
[00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:22.590]  Now, that's criminal.
[00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:25.590]  You need to put in a judicial complaint for judicial misconduct.
[00:28:25.590 --> 00:28:29.590]  They will also try to edit those transcripts, at least a lot of people try that.
[00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:32.590]  But you do have your witnesses of what they said.
[00:28:32.590 --> 00:28:34.590]  No wonder, oh, they know.
[00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:38.590]  You better sue them now and get a subpoena.
[00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:42.590]  And, oh, man, I tell you, this is incredible.
[00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:48.590]  And we just keep getting the runaround over and over and over about why we can't get the transcripts yet.
[00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.590]  Well, they have to give you the transcripts.
[00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:53.590]  Well, we're trying, but they just keep putting it off and putting it off.
[00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:55.590]  And the transcripts have been paid for.
[00:28:55.590 --> 00:29:00.590]  Well, there's a lot of stuff that they have to do and that they're legally required to do that they're just not doing.
[00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:05.590]  I mean, it's interesting for all the listeners to note that it was pointed out by myself
[00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:11.590]  and by Dr. Chase and others in the hearing itself about the Bill of Rights
[00:29:11.590 --> 00:29:17.590]  and even the Colorado statutory exemption for these vaccinations.
[00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:21.590]  And the courts these days, they think it's a joke.
[00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:27.590]  Well, the FBI was caught in Denver arguing in court that the Constitution is not a defense and that you can't use it.
[00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:28.590]  And the judge agreed.
[00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.590]  But let me just say this.
[00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:33.590]  Don't get a lawyer from the area unless you really trust them.
[00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:35.590]  Get one from outside the area.
[00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:41.590]  They'll be taught this new crackerjack law that you get out of a box of popcorn.
[00:29:41.590 --> 00:29:45.590]  You need to get somebody who knows the Constitution Bill of Rights.
[00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:48.590]  And I would use the civil rights as well as the First Amendment argument.
[00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:53.590]  I don't know if you would go with UCC because it's real, but they'll totally ignore that as you learned.
[00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:59.590]  You have got major lawsuits here, just the practicing medicine without a license, all of this stuff,
[00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:05.590]  and telling you to give the child the shot, having that order, you can get all of that.
[00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.590]  You ought to put the newspaper onto this.
[00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:10.590]  I know they're probably part of the establishment and don't want to.
[00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.590]  You need to get on local talk radio, though we're on in Colorado.
[00:30:13.590 --> 00:30:17.590]  What is Grand Junction close to?
[00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:22.590]  It's in itself the biggest.
[00:30:22.590 --> 00:30:26.590]  Western Colorado, it's pretty much the biggest city.
[00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:30.590]  Five hours from Denver, in between Denver and Salt Lake.
[00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:32.590]  Okay, everybody's talking at once.
[00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.590]  Michael, where is Grand Junction?
[00:30:34.590 --> 00:30:37.590]  It's located about halfway between Denver and Salt Lake.
[00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:42.590]  It's on the western border of Colorado, pretty much the biggest city in that area.
[00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:45.590]  I believe you can hear my show in that area.
[00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:50.590]  I know we've got four affiliates that basically cover the state.
[00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:54.590]  Well, this is just par for the course, what they do.
[00:30:54.590 --> 00:31:04.590]  So when they finally dropped it, have you confronted the doctors and people themselves with this fact?
[00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:10.590]  Yes, we have, and they said it was in the child's best interest, just in case,
[00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.590]  that they wanted to err on the side of caution.
[00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:14.590]  There's liability.
[00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:21.590]  A lot of times when they give a test, you have to sign a form saying you know that it means that you may not really have it,
[00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:24.590]  especially with tests like the quick hepatitis B test they give.
[00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.590]  They had to know that.
[00:31:26.590 --> 00:31:28.590]  They did.
[00:31:28.590 --> 00:31:35.590]  Do you have any suspicions that your wife really didn't, that the test never even said that?
[00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:39.590]  Well, we saw a copy of the lab report, and it was positive,
[00:31:39.590 --> 00:31:42.590]  but it also said this will be confirmed by another method.
[00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:44.590]  And we knew she didn't have it.
[00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:50.590]  I have trouble believing, though, that the test ever did really say that, or if it did actually say that,
[00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:56.590]  it was a screw-up on their part because of the four or five tests we've done since then,
[00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.590]  not a single one has turned out remotely positive.
[00:31:58.590 --> 00:32:01.590]  Well, that's a big thing for you to have in court.
[00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:05.590]  So are you planning to sue them?
[00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:08.590]  At this point, we are looking for legal counsel.
[00:32:08.590 --> 00:32:14.590]  So we are not one of those families that can pay someone 300 bucks an hour to do this sort of thing.
[00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:15.590]  Okay.
[00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:17.590]  We've got somebody that wants to talk to you.
[00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:21.590]  Then I want to give some contact out for you for folks that want to help you
[00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:23.590]  or put you on to good people in the Colorado area.
[00:32:23.590 --> 00:32:25.590]  Mike in Arizona, you're on the air with our guests.
[00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:26.590]  Go ahead.
[00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:29.590]  We'll have to fade some of you guys down when he talks and fade you back up.
[00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:30.590]  Go ahead, Mike.
[00:32:30.590 --> 00:32:31.590]  Yes, hi.
[00:32:31.590 --> 00:32:39.590]  I'm curious, why did somebody think that the mother had hepatitis B?
[00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:44.590]  It was an initial screening test that they did when we first went into the hospital.
[00:32:44.590 --> 00:32:48.590]  It was a planned home birth that ran into complications,
[00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:52.590]  and we decided that for the best interest of our child, we should head to the hospital.
[00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:55.590]  And the doctor wanted to do an immediate C-section,
[00:32:55.590 --> 00:33:00.590]  and standard procedure before they do any type of surgery is to have blood tests.
[00:33:00.590 --> 00:33:01.590]  Yeah, obviously.
[00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:04.590]  What do you think about what is being said here, Mike?
[00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:08.590]  Yeah, I think it's just an unfortunate set of circumstances.
[00:33:08.590 --> 00:33:10.590]  There is, you know, one of the ways,
[00:33:10.590 --> 00:33:16.590]  but the only way that an infant could get hepatitis B is from, well,
[00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:21.590]  an infant, a newborn, is going to get it from the mother, critical transmission.
[00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:25.590]  So there is legitimate concern there.
[00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:28.590]  But, you know.
[00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:31.590]  What about saying we only want your firstborn?
[00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:35.590]  Well, I think that was just some dark humor on the part of the nurse,
[00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:39.590]  just a sick joke and totally inappropriate.
[00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:43.590]  But I think there is a problem with this elitist mentality that we know better
[00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:45.590]  how to take care of your child than you do.
[00:33:45.590 --> 00:33:47.590]  You sound like a doctor, Mike.
[00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:48.590]  Yeah, I am.
[00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:55.590]  And I think the way you hit that off, prevent this kind of thing from happening in the first place.
[00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:56.590]  Well, Mike, I'll hold you over.
[00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:57.590]  One more segment with our guests so they can stay.
[00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:59.590]  But let me just say this, and don't hang up, Mike.
[00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:00.590]  Yeah.
[00:34:00.590 --> 00:34:01.590]  I've been to the hospitals.
[00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:02.590]  I've covered this, sir.
[00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.590]  It may not be like this at your hospital.
[00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:09.590]  It is hell on earth in Austin, Texas.
[00:34:09.590 --> 00:34:11.590]  Do you believe me, Mike?
[00:34:11.590 --> 00:34:14.590]  Mike, are you there?
[00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.590]  Well, we'll see if he's there when we get back after the break.
[00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:18.590]  Mike, you still there?
[00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:19.590]  Okay.
[00:34:19.590 --> 00:34:22.590]  We'll be right back, folks, on the other side of this quick break.
[00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:25.590]  And we'll talk to Mike, who says he's a doctor, and we'll let the family talk.
[00:34:25.590 --> 00:34:30.590]  We've got like six people online now, so we'll try to keep us all juggled and balanced.
[00:34:30.590 --> 00:34:34.590]  Kind of hard to do with audio-wise, but folks are doing a great job of a genesis.
[00:34:34.590 --> 00:34:35.590]  Stay with us.
[00:34:36.490 --> 00:34:49.970]  Thanks for listening to the M2K talk archives.
[00:34:49.970 --> 00:34:53.370]  And we are listener supported with the honor system.
[00:34:53.370 --> 00:34:55.129]  We ask that you wait.
[00:34:55.129 --> 00:35:01.370]  Don't donate a dollar at a time PayPal charges a 35 cent surcharge on anything of a dollar
[00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:02.370]  or less.
[00:35:02.370 --> 00:35:05.990]  Wait till you listen to five or 10 and then donate please.
[00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.950]  We appreciate your voluntary support.
[00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:21.669]  We've got Dr. Cera Case, we've got Richard, Mike who's a doctor, we've got a bunch of
[00:35:21.669 --> 00:35:27.270]  the family, the grandmother, the mother, the mother, the father.
[00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:29.350]  We've got all these different people online.
[00:35:29.350 --> 00:35:34.990]  Again, the mother of the mother, the mother of the mother's mother, the father and we
[00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:42.069]  have their cousin, Dr. Cera Case on the show as well and it's just like cops.
[00:35:42.069 --> 00:35:46.950]  80 percent of cops are good but since they're good they think the 20 percent that are bad
[00:35:46.950 --> 00:35:49.750]  must be good and then have to protect them.
[00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:50.750]  Same thing with doctors.
[00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:54.589]  The doctors are just useful idiots carrying out whatever the establishment has to say
[00:35:54.589 --> 00:35:59.830]  and I have seen it, especially in city run hospitals, they are child kidnapping mills.
[00:35:59.830 --> 00:36:04.229]  I don't know about this hospital but I know what we put on TV in Austin.
[00:36:04.470 --> 00:36:09.149]  The lies and the CPS reports that would say the baby was abused a year and a half ago.
[00:36:09.149 --> 00:36:14.310]  We have nine witnesses and it's a newborn baby and they've got the name of the newborn
[00:36:14.310 --> 00:36:15.310]  baby.
[00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:19.990]  It's stuff like this, just insane.
[00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:22.189]  Mike you were making a point when we hit that last break.
[00:36:22.189 --> 00:36:23.189]  Go ahead.
[00:36:23.189 --> 00:36:26.310]  Well, just a couple quick observations.
[00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:33.509]  It's ironic that the system has developed where we allow doctors and attorneys and other
[00:36:33.509 --> 00:36:40.870]  people to second guess the parents and put them in the position of the parents in effect.
[00:36:40.870 --> 00:36:44.950]  We assume that the parents are idiots and can't make good decisions and unfortunately
[00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:47.229]  there are instances where that is the case.
[00:36:47.229 --> 00:36:49.109]  But that's the way the world works.
[00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:52.310]  It's better to have some idiots out there than have a big giant government.
[00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:57.950]  Yeah, I guess you have to come down on that side, certainly I do, but it's kind of ironic
[00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:04.430]  that the system also says that women ought to have the autonomy to be able to decide
[00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:05.430]  to terminate that child's life.
[00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:11.549]  Well, what about the hospitals saying, okay, you sign a form saying we have no liability
[00:37:11.549 --> 00:37:12.910]  and then that would protect the hospital.
[00:37:12.910 --> 00:37:16.470]  Any comments Dr. Chase or Case?
[00:37:16.470 --> 00:37:21.509]  Any comments from the family on what Mike is saying?
[00:37:21.549 --> 00:37:29.549]  I think he's right that it's amazing to me that they will kill unborn children without
[00:37:29.549 --> 00:37:35.509]  flinching an eye, but that they will violate parents' rights as parents and as Americans
[00:37:35.509 --> 00:37:40.990]  just on a whim if they think they have something to gain from it.
[00:37:40.990 --> 00:37:46.549]  I'd like to make a little bit of clarity for Mike and any of the other listeners out there.
[00:37:46.589 --> 00:37:51.790]  There was a confirmatory test that was scheduled to arrive 16 hours later at the time of the
[00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:55.229]  hearing and the judge refused to wait for it.
[00:37:55.229 --> 00:37:59.750]  And he also refused to wait for the following day so that we could get a little better of
[00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:00.750]  a defense together.
[00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:06.870]  So those are two other pretty major issues, I believe, in this circumstance is that even
[00:38:06.870 --> 00:38:07.870]  if they thought...
[00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:14.870]  Let me ask Mike and Chase about this.
[00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:21.509]  What about the situation where you have them where the insert of the hepatitis B shot says
[00:38:21.509 --> 00:38:25.109]  don't take it for a month and a half to two months after the first shot and they're saying
[00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:27.189]  you will take this in seven days.
[00:38:27.189 --> 00:38:30.270]  Isn't there a major liability there for the social worker?
[00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:33.149]  I think that's negligible.
[00:38:33.149 --> 00:38:39.549]  I believe it was the neonatologist in the hearing and also recommending to the judge
[00:38:39.549 --> 00:38:43.589]  and the judge declaring that the second shot had to be in seven days.
[00:38:44.109 --> 00:38:53.109]  That doctor had to know, he has to be a pediatrician first to be that type of doctor in the hospital
[00:38:53.109 --> 00:38:54.109]  from what I've read.
[00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:56.069]  Is that correct from what you know?
[00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:57.069]  Yes.
[00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:58.069]  Yes.
[00:38:58.069 --> 00:39:03.069]  And he should know what those guidelines are if he's out there recommending vaccination.
[00:39:03.069 --> 00:39:06.069]  Mike, do you have any comments to that?
[00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:07.069]  Oh, sure.
[00:39:07.069 --> 00:39:08.069]  Absolutely.
[00:39:08.549 --> 00:39:14.589]  But I think the take home lesson here is that like dealing with any professional, whether
[00:39:14.589 --> 00:39:23.870]  you're a mechanic or an attorney or a doctor, you go in armed with questions and with knowledge
[00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:26.509]  and put them on the defensive.
[00:39:26.509 --> 00:39:28.310]  Otherwise they assume that they know best.
[00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:33.189]  If you're going to have a home birth, I would have a backup with a hospital, I would shop
[00:39:33.189 --> 00:39:36.830]  around with doctors and I would get to know them first.
[00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:39.069]  Is that a smart thing to do?
[00:39:39.069 --> 00:39:40.069]  Absolutely.
[00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:44.069]  And you ask them questions like, is there mercury in the preservative for this vaccine?
[00:39:45.069 --> 00:39:48.069]  Show them that you've done your homework, ask them questions that they probably won't
[00:39:48.069 --> 00:39:49.069]  be able to answer.
[00:39:49.069 --> 00:39:54.069]  And act like you're a fruitcake, deliver them 25 mainstream news articles where major countries
[00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:57.069]  like Japan are stopping giving shots to children until age two.
[00:39:58.069 --> 00:40:03.069]  Alex, it was amazing how in such a short notice for this hearing, how the family was able
[00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:04.310]  to gather information.
[00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:11.310]  And in that court hearing, they put up a really good fight with so little notice and no expert
[00:40:11.310 --> 00:40:12.310]  help.
[00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.310]  Okay.
[00:40:13.310 --> 00:40:14.310]  Well, I want to commend you guys for your courage.
[00:40:14.310 --> 00:40:15.310]  I hope you sue them on 100 fronts.
[00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:19.310]  You know, have 10 different things you're suing them for so they can't stop at all.
[00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:24.310]  How do people contact you guys if they want to give you help or want to tell you about
[00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:25.310]  a lawyer in the area?
[00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:27.310]  Okay.
[00:40:27.549 --> 00:40:32.549]  We should have a pretty bare bones website up in the next couple hours at forcevaccination.netfirm.com.
[00:40:37.549 --> 00:40:40.549]  I'll tell you what, let's just do three or four minutes on the other side.
[00:40:40.549 --> 00:40:43.549]  I've got news I've got to cover in some calls, but I want to talk about this more.
[00:40:44.549 --> 00:40:51.549]  And I want to, you need to give out a number, even if it's Dr. Chase, because you need to
[00:40:51.549 --> 00:40:52.549]  have people contact you now.
[00:40:52.549 --> 00:40:53.549]  You need to get on this now.
[00:40:54.549 --> 00:40:55.549]  We'll be right back.
[00:40:55.549 --> 00:40:56.549]  Stay with us.
[00:40:56.790 --> 00:40:57.790]  Here we go.
[00:40:58.790 --> 00:40:59.790]  We're on the march.
[00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:01.790]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:05.790]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:27.800]  It's 20, 30 years ago in America, your children were yours, we could have our doors open at
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:33.640]  night, we had more freedom, the more government we get, the more control we get, I got articles
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:37.280]  here out of England what they're doing to the healthcare system, once they socialize
[00:41:37.280 --> 00:41:42.000]  it they take total control of your life, say what you can eat, what you can drink, they're
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.480]  going to make you swipe your national ID card to have a record of what you eat and what
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:49.880]  you do to quote the side of you get healthcare, you don't take the vaccines, they take your
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:52.960]  healthcare away and it's not even a law.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.840]  This is the control of the new world order, the micromanagement of the control freaks
[00:41:57.840 --> 00:42:00.280]  on steroids.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:06.520]  All the crimes they commit, all the falsification of evidence, all the judicial misconduct,
[00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:11.360]  all the institutionalized evil is acceptable and okay because they're the boss, they're
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:15.640]  the government, we're their property, no that's not the case.
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:20.560]  We're about to go to Clinton, Missouri who wants to talk to this family, talking to Dr.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:28.280]  Sarah Chase who is the sister of the mother of the lady who had the child, who's married
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:34.600]  to the husband who we have on as well, Michael, we have the grandmother on, do you guys have
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:38.720]  a phone number we can give out for people that want to point you to a good lawyer or
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:42.800]  common law person or somebody that really knows what's happening, I'd get a lot of different
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:48.600]  opinions or for anybody that wants to be able to assist you in paperwork and stuff, how
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.640]  do people get in contact with you?
[00:42:52.640 --> 00:43:08.160]  They can call us at 970-268-5570, again 970-268-5570 and leave a message and also an email contact
[00:43:08.160 --> 00:43:14.160]  where I can email you the situation, what happened and also a list of who was involved
[00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:20.040]  in this court hearing and also people to call, legislators, judicial commissions, whatever.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:31.240]  That email address is k-a-t-c-c-2 at hotmail.com, say it again, k-a-t-c-c-2, the number two
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:42.360]  at hotmail.com, alright that number again is 970-268-5570, yes, alright I hope folks
[00:43:42.360 --> 00:43:43.360]  will contact you.
[00:43:43.360 --> 00:43:46.320]  One quick call and some final comments from me and I appreciate you staying on so long
[00:43:46.320 --> 00:43:47.320]  and your courage.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:48.320]  Thank you.
[00:43:48.320 --> 00:43:52.240]  Because this is happening to everybody now, especially blue collar folks, they're even
[00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:53.240]  in more trouble.
[00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.720]  Yes, and this is in Grand Junction, Colorado.
[00:43:55.720 --> 00:44:00.520]  Yep, Clint in Missouri, you're on the air, go ahead.
[00:44:00.520 --> 00:44:04.800]  Yeah I just want to tell the family, don't feel bad when my wife was in the hospital
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:10.800]  with our second child, when she first got admitted her water had already broken home
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.880]  and they took a lab sample and everything and came back up and told us her water didn't
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:23.240]  break and we informed them yes it did, she would know when this happened and then they
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:27.280]  called the lab and said oh yeah they made a mistake, it did break, so that's the kind
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:30.080]  of foolishness that you run into.
[00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:34.680]  Yeah, some of these lab techs are drug addicts because they want to get near the drugs and
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:38.960]  they're sitting there in the back just lazily listening to heavy metal music doing this
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:41.000]  stuff, there's a lot of mistakes.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.640]  Well it just goes to show they really do think that the parents don't know, you know, they
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:50.440]  think you're so stupid that you wouldn't know when this happened.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:54.320]  Yeah, I assumed this was a young couple and they thought they could just railroad them
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:59.360]  over and plus they kept telling the young couple oh just comply, everybody else does.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:03.320]  Now just go into the railway car, everybody else does.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:07.680]  I have a comment, I'm the grandmother, I misidentified myself earlier as the mother,
[00:45:07.680 --> 00:45:14.680]  I'm the grandmother, at the screening, I'm sorry, at the hearing it was, we had some
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:20.040]  evidence that was faxed into it at the last minute, they gave the parents 15 minutes notice
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:25.120]  that we had faxed into the hospital, some information, there were three different reports
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:32.000]  written by medical doctors, one of the reports said that 75% of the screening tests for hepatitis
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.200]  C are false positive and the other two reports had different figures, they were all very
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:40.280]  high but the highest was 75%.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:44.520]  And of course it turned out that she did not have the antibodies for it and did not have
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.560]  hepatitis.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:51.080]  That's true and we knew that, we knew that the people at risk for hepatitis are people
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:57.600]  who have promiscuous sex or handle blood or do drugs or well any of those and we knew
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:45:58.600]  that.
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:45:59.600]  Or have had a recent blood transfusion.
[00:45:59.600 --> 00:46:04.840]  Right and our daughter and her husband, neither of them were at risk for any of those.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.680]  The first time they kissed was at the marriage altar.
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:12.440]  They don't handle blood, they don't do drugs, they were not even at risk.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:18.280]  I have another sister who is a medical doctor and told her about this and she said that
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:22.760]  they should not even begin treatment of a newborn for hepatitis B until there are three
[00:46:22.760 --> 00:46:26.200]  confirmatory tests for hepatitis B in the mother.
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:30.040]  Well you've got a major lawsuit even though they've tried to refuse to give you the transcripts
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:37.720]  and just get on it, do what you have to, do it pro se if you have to and sue them personally.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:43.840]  You know what's interesting Alex is the family has contacted all the Christian, legal Christian
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:49.560]  organizations out there like the Rutherford Institute and some of the others who are supposedly
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:52.000]  out there fighting for the liberties of Americans.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.040]  All of them said no, we're not going to help you.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:47:00.840]  We don't think you have a case or we can't help you and so we are talking to other attorneys
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:09.320]  but the Christian organizations turned us down which makes me wonder what their real agenda is.
[00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:12.920]  Well I think we know what it is, a lot of them are sold out to the New World Order.
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:13.880]  I think so.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:17.080]  Absolutely, anything else you want to add Clint?
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:21.160]  Yeah I was wondering if you would mind if I gave out a phone number.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:27.240]  Here in my area of the country we only have two options on AM radio right now and that's
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:34.120]  Rush Limbaugh between the hours of 11 and 2 and Bill O'Reilly and Bill O'Reilly isn't
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:38.280]  doing so good and I expect the other station to drop him and I was wondering if I could
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:43.080]  give out that station number and have listeners call in and request that they carry your show.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.720]  What's the station call letters?
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.600]  K-A-P-E AM 1550 Cape Girardeau, Missouri.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:53.080]  Sure, go ahead give it out.
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:58.840]  Okay area code 573-339-1550.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:04.680]  Now you know if it's a Clear Channel Loan station or a Westwinds you could forget it.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:12.920]  Well it's a local company I think called Withers Broadcast.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:14.520]  Oh okay well that's good news, sure.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.400]  What's the number again?
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:25.640]  Area code 573-339-1550 please call a request station manager to carry the Alex Jones show.
[00:48:25.640 --> 00:48:27.400]  All right sounds good thanks for the call.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:27.880]  Thank you.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:28.380]  Clint.
[00:48:29.240 --> 00:48:33.160]  Well I appreciate Sarah Chase coming on the show.
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:37.880]  Sarah Chase and her family and this is just an incredible story of what happens to educated
[00:48:37.880 --> 00:48:40.200]  Christian middle class people.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.040]  Imagine what's happening to blue-collar folks that have no idea what their rights are and
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.040]  weren't taught anything in school.
[00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:47.960]  It is an epidemic of evil.
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:53.000]  The child grabbing services are all over the place and they attack at birth and to be aware
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:49:00.520]  of this and be informed and have a support group with you when you go into one of these
[00:49:00.520 --> 00:49:04.280]  hospitals and they're not all bad but they're becoming bad because of the system and the
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:05.000]  training.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:06.440]  Thanks for coming on the show.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:06.940]  Thanks.
