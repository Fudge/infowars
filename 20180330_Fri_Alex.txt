[00:00.000 --> 00:19.000]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report, it's Alex Jones.
[00:19.000 --> 00:25.000]  I have a confession to make. I support the Parkland students. I support their call for gun control.
[00:25.000 --> 00:31.000]  Do I support their call for gun control because I think they're going to achieve any significant gun control measures? No.
[00:31.000 --> 00:38.000]  I support them because this issue is perhaps the only thing that can energize conservatives and get them out to vote in the midterms.
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  Look what's happened in the polls since the left began this gun control crusade.
[00:44.000 --> 00:52.000]  Republicans were 15 points behind in the race for the House. Now that's narrowed to 5 points almost within the margin of error.
[00:52.000 --> 00:57.000]  Most conservatives were calling the House a write-off, but now it's game on again.
[00:57.000 --> 01:03.000]  Why? Because gun control is a losing issue for Democrats. It always has been.
[01:03.000 --> 01:08.000]  After Bill Clinton passed an assault weapons ban, he lost 54 seats in the House.
[01:08.000 --> 01:12.000]  The Democrats have made the midterm elections a referendum on Trump.
[01:12.000 --> 01:18.000]  Now Trump needs to make the midterm elections a referendum on constitutional rights.
[01:18.000 --> 01:22.000]  This is how he energizes the base. This is how he turns out voters.
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.000]  The entire March for Our Lives campaign has been one huge own goal.
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  The left just couldn't contain their arrogance. First it was banning bump stocks and restricting AR-15 sales.
[01:34.000 --> 01:40.000]  Now it's ban all guns, take them from your cold dead hands and repeal the Second Amendment.
[01:40.000 --> 01:44.000]  When they give us that inch, that bump stock ban, we will take a mile.
[01:44.000 --> 01:50.000]  Because only Trump's Nazi regime and racist police officers should be allowed to have weapons, right?
[01:50.000 --> 01:56.000]  Oh yeah, and the security at gun control rallies. But seriously, they've made a huge political error.
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.000]  Notice how some Democrats responded to that New York Times op-ed.
[02:00.000 --> 02:04.000]  Think Progress, Washington Post, they're all panicking.
[02:04.000 --> 02:10.000]  They realized that this gun control purge has woken up Republicans from their slumber.
[02:10.000 --> 02:14.000]  Listen to what the Washington Post's Aaron Blake said.
[02:14.000 --> 02:18.000]  The move might as well be considered an in-kind contribution to the National Rifle Association,
[02:18.000 --> 02:26.000]  to Republicans' efforts to keep the House and Senate in 2018, and to President Trump's 2020 re-election bid.
[02:26.000 --> 02:32.000]  Shh, don't tell them what we actually plan to do, idiots. You might rile them up and give them a reason to vote against us.
[02:32.000 --> 02:39.000]  You have over 100 million semi-automatic weapons in the United States right now. What do you do with those?
[02:39.000 --> 02:42.000]  You know what? You give them that's a real question.
[02:42.000 --> 02:54.000]  See, that's exactly what I mean. How insane do you need to be to think you can disarm 70 million American gun owners of 300 million guns with no consequences whatsoever?
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  The left is actually that crazy, and the fact they've let slip this agenda is blowing up in their faces.
[03:01.000 --> 03:05.000]  The march for our lives was just a huge recruitment drive for Democrats.
[03:05.000 --> 03:14.000]  Less than 10% of the attendees were children. You really think those who organized the protests, the big Soros groups, the big Democratic organizations,
[03:14.000 --> 03:17.000]  really care about ending gun violence.
[03:17.000 --> 03:23.000]  No, they care about power, but they've made a huge tactical mistake.
[03:23.000 --> 03:32.000]  Gun control is as toxic an issue to the Democratic Party as Hillary Clinton was, so let them keep talking about it.
[03:32.000 --> 03:37.000]  Amplify their voices. Don't interrupt the enemy when they're making a mistake.
[03:37.000 --> 03:41.000]  Look what's happened already. Gun sales are surging again.
[03:41.000 --> 03:46.000]  The midterm polls are tightening. Even in CNN's poll, Trump's approval rating is climbing.
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.000]  NRA donations more than tripled in February.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  This is backfiring on the left massively.
[03:53.000 --> 03:57.000]  And to conservatives, don't argue with teenagers.
[03:57.000 --> 04:04.000]  The optics of arguing with children are terrible. Let them talk. Let them continue to piss off gun owners.
[04:04.000 --> 04:09.000]  Gun owners who will then be more determined than ever to vote against Democrats in November.
[04:09.000 --> 04:13.000]  If you criticize some of what they're saying, then all of a sudden you're the bad guy.
[04:13.000 --> 04:14.000]  You are the bad guy.
[04:14.000 --> 04:17.000]  No, I agree with Don Lemon.
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.000]  Don't criticize the Parkland students. Encourage them.
[04:21.000 --> 04:29.000]  Because in their rush to exploit tragedy and use children as political props, the left has made a huge miscalculation.
[04:29.000 --> 04:58.000]  One that could actually give conservatives a chance this November of snatching victory from the jaws of defeat.
[04:59.000 --> 05:03.000]  InfoWarsLife is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it.

[06:24.000 --> 06:25.000]  What?
[06:25.000 --> 06:27.000]  What?
[06:27.000 --> 06:30.000]  Alex Jones
[06:31.000 --> 06:35.000]  Scum, Russian scum.
[06:37.000 --> 06:39.000]  Until the war comes to mind.
[06:39.000 --> 06:53.000]  Reputation is amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[06:53.000 --> 07:06.000]  Bill, vote on or before the 12th for Donald J. Trump for President. Thank you.
[07:06.000 --> 07:11.000]  That was Saturday at a rally in Florida. Trump was asking supporters to raise their hands,
[07:11.000 --> 07:16.000]  vowing to vote for him in the March 15th primary. But that led to headlines like these,
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  where some compared that moment to something that might have happened at a rally in Nazi Germany.
[07:21.000 --> 07:26.000]  We all look at Adolf Hitler in 1940. We should look at Adolf Hitler in 1929.
[07:26.000 --> 07:31.000]  He was a kind of a funny kind of character that said the things that people were thinking.
[07:31.000 --> 07:38.000]  Where Donald Trump takes it, I have absolutely no idea. But Donald Trump is a dangerous man with the things that he has been saying.
[07:38.000 --> 07:47.000]  So I had one of Hitler's speeches translated into English and I think this tells us a lot about where Donald Trump is getting his ideas.
[07:47.000 --> 07:55.000]  Look at this Hitler speech and we've translated it for you. Thank you. Thank you. We're going to make Germany great again.
[07:55.000 --> 08:03.000]  That I can tell you, believe me. So when people ask why you support Donald Trump, you just tell them.
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  He's going to take our economy from here to here.
[08:08.000 --> 08:15.000]  My understanding is you want to clear the air because you think you're being unfavorably compared to Donald Trump.
[08:15.000 --> 08:24.000]  Don't get me wrong, Conan. I agree with a lot. He says a lot, like 90% of what he says. I'm like, this guy gets it.
[08:24.000 --> 08:30.000]  But it's just, I don't like the way he says it. It's just, it's crass.
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  Yeah. Yeah. Trump is very, very crass. Yeah.
[08:37.000 --> 08:46.000]  So Sarah Silverman can dress up in a Hitler outfit and then connect it to Trump.
[08:46.000 --> 08:55.000]  And you know what? I say she has that right to absolutely do that 100% under the First Amendment, under satire. She can do it.
[08:55.000 --> 08:58.000]  He's a public figure.
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.000]  But I have ordered a Hitler uniform. It's coming. It should be here next week.
[09:04.000 --> 09:16.000]  And I guarantee you, when I put that thing on and I get in here and I interview one of the other crew members, say, oh, it's Shroy or David Knight.
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  And I endorse Hillary and I endorse Obama.
[09:20.000 --> 09:29.000]  And then I endorse their policies that are very Hitlerian like censorship and invading countries and war and using racial based politics to control people.
[09:29.000 --> 09:40.000]  I guarantee you that there'll be thousands of news articles that I am the devil and that it needs to be censored.
[09:40.000 --> 09:51.000]  You know why I know Darren McBrain put together a video on Friday that was a minute and a half long of David Hogg wearing an armband and giving solutions.
[09:51.000 --> 09:56.000]  And he doesn't just put the fist up. He turns militarily the way Hitler would.
[09:56.000 --> 09:59.000]  He's obviously being choreographed. He's being coached.
[09:59.000 --> 10:04.000]  I'm not saying they're crisis actors. I'm saying they're spokespersons, the Democratic Party and George Soros.
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  He funds it. Private jets, buses, everything.
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  And when we point that out, they spin it.
[10:12.000 --> 10:19.000]  Vice has put out a big report editing my video to make it sound like I'm saying nobody died and that Hogg is a crisis actor.
[10:19.000 --> 10:23.000]  They're still doing it to misrepresent what I've said.
[10:23.000 --> 10:30.000]  Now I'm saying out of 3,000 students, they picked four, rolled them out, deployed them and that's admitted.
[10:30.000 --> 10:35.000]  BuzzFeed's written about it. It's a fact. They brag about it. The New York Times brags.
[10:35.000 --> 10:49.000]  But if you look at how Hogg turns and then thrust his arm up, that's how it's done militarily as a solute, as a fascist salute.
[10:49.000 --> 11:00.000]  He clicks his heels, ladies and gentlemen, which takes it from fascista with Mussolini to the Germans added the heel clicking.
[11:00.000 --> 11:08.000]  And then it becomes Austrian-Hungarian Empire salute, merge with the Roman salute.
[11:08.000 --> 11:15.000]  I remember one time we were in art class and they took us to the museum and I remember the students going,
[11:15.000 --> 11:29.000]  we didn't know there were Nazis in Rome because there was a famous painting of Roman generals hailing Roman emperor and that's the salute.
[11:29.000 --> 11:34.000]  I won't even do it because the media will grab it and say I did it, but what Hitler did, outstretched the whole deal.
[11:34.000 --> 11:43.000]  You click your heels though, baby, it's a Nazi salute.
[11:43.000 --> 11:48.000]  And now I'm starting to think they baited us, put him in the armband and having him do all that.
[11:48.000 --> 11:53.000]  So they go, look, the survivors, the children, they're comparing it to Nazis.
[11:53.000 --> 11:56.000]  Well, man, you're wearing armbands and clicking your heels, bro.
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  And say, they're shaking in their boots. We're going to get them.
[12:00.000 --> 12:08.000]  And now we've got all these videos of Hogg's cussing and screaming and we're going to effing shut these people up and we're going to take them out.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  Believe me, bro, I know CNN and your name came within inches of knocking our YouTube channel off.
[12:14.000 --> 12:17.000]  That's reached billions of people.
[12:17.000 --> 12:25.000]  So people make the comparisons to Nazi youth.
[12:25.000 --> 12:33.000]  Many have made that done control youth movements, the less more akin to Mao and his youth movements, but he also took the guns.
[12:33.000 --> 12:39.000]  We cover all of that and they turn it around and say, you're hateful.
[12:39.000 --> 12:40.000]  You need to be banned.
[12:40.000 --> 12:47.000]  And the video that the green put out disappeared off of our YouTube site Saturday.
[12:47.000 --> 12:48.000]  They didn't give us a strike.
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  It just disappeared.
[12:52.000 --> 12:55.000]  And then everywhere else it was, it disappeared.
[12:55.000 --> 12:59.000]  And then we tried to re upload it and it won't let us re upload it.
[12:59.000 --> 13:06.000]  And everyone else is now reporting just like the purge of guns two weeks ago on YouTube and the purges before that.
[13:06.000 --> 13:11.000]  They never announced them till we point them out till Drudge points it out and they admit they're purging.
[13:11.000 --> 13:20.000]  Everyone memes Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, anyone comparing.
[13:20.000 --> 13:30.000]  Hog and the youth movements parallel to Nazi Germany, which are very strong parallels is being banned or blocked.
[13:30.000 --> 13:39.000]  And then there's all these news articles attaching me saying, why is Joan still even online ban him for calling David Hog and Nazi?
[13:39.000 --> 13:46.000]  Well, even if I did call him a Nazi, he's a public figure and I can make those parallels.
[13:46.000 --> 13:53.000]  And then if he wanted to try to take me to court and win a lawsuit, which he wouldn't then then maybe YouTube could take down a video.
[13:53.000 --> 14:05.000]  But no, the argument from the left is ban anyone that says the left is racist or the left is connected to Hitler.
[14:05.000 --> 14:13.000]  And then we show you the art and the memes that we didn't even create that compare him to a brown shirt.
[14:13.000 --> 14:17.000]  And then they have the Daily Mail say, look what Jones made.
[14:17.000 --> 14:23.000]  So they also journalistically misrepresent what we've covered and what we've done and what we're showing you.
[14:23.000 --> 14:30.000]  You know, when CNN shows Hog compared to Hitler and show somebody else's work with CNN saying Hog was Hitler.
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.000]  These are the semantical games they play and they have total disdain for you.
[14:36.000 --> 14:37.000]  Look, it's people's right.
[14:37.000 --> 14:43.000]  David Hog's a public figure trying to take an American basic right and they go, well, he's a survivor.
[14:43.000 --> 14:45.000]  You know, I think the shooting happened.
[14:45.000 --> 14:52.000]  I think he was there, but we can play the video where he says he was at home and wrote his bike there.
[14:52.000 --> 14:54.000]  Then he said he was always there during the shooting.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  Then he's in there doing interviews while the shooting is going on, supposedly.
[14:58.000 --> 15:06.000]  And all I'm saying is if somebody says something and then they say something completely different, I have a right.
[15:06.000 --> 15:11.000]  Whether they're a public figure or not, and he is a public figure to then say that's a little interesting.
[15:11.000 --> 15:13.000]  I question that.
[15:13.000 --> 15:16.000]  I think that's interesting.
[15:16.000 --> 15:19.000]  And look, people are making these memes.
[15:19.000 --> 15:23.000]  I knew something was off about that kid.
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.000]  Made three days ago, but there's just thousands of these.
[15:26.000 --> 15:29.000]  And they're saying you can't do that.
[15:29.000 --> 15:34.000]  Meanwhile, Hillary moderator at Rutgers invokes Nazism and Trump.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  And then Hillary talks about how scared she is.
[15:36.000 --> 15:37.000]  That's coming up.
[15:37.000 --> 15:40.000]  So again, they say the OK sign is Nazi.
[15:40.000 --> 15:43.000]  They say just having short hair is evil if you're a white guy.
[15:43.000 --> 15:44.000]  Everything's Nazi.
[15:44.000 --> 15:45.000]  Everyone's a Nazi.
[15:45.000 --> 15:47.000]  Hitler's, you know, taking over.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  Trump's Hitler.
[15:48.000 --> 15:49.000]  I'm Hitler.
[15:49.000 --> 15:54.000]  But then they've got their public figure out there actually clicking his heel and doing fascist salutes.
[15:54.000 --> 15:55.000]  We're like, man, this is creepy.
[15:55.000 --> 15:58.000]  They're like, you can't say that.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  ID stronghold wallets are different.
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  They may look the same on the outside.
[16:04.000 --> 16:05.000]  They're stylish.
[16:05.000 --> 16:06.000]  They'll hold your cards in cash.
[16:06.000 --> 16:09.000]  But they're hiding something great on the inside.
[16:09.000 --> 16:11.000]  No, there are no pilot techniques.
[16:11.000 --> 16:13.000]  And it doesn't sing when you open it.
[16:13.000 --> 16:16.000]  But it does have magical powers.

[18:59.000 --> 19:02.000]  Infowars life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine.
[19:02.000 --> 19:04.000]  Introducing pollen block.
[19:04.000 --> 19:10.000]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms including
[19:10.000 --> 19:16.000]  promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory functions.
[19:16.000 --> 19:25.000]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[19:25.000 --> 19:31.000]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research,
[19:31.000 --> 19:36.000]  a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine.
[19:40.000 --> 19:46.000]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase,
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[19:50.000 --> 19:53.000]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[19:53.000 --> 20:11.000]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[20:23.000 --> 20:27.000]  You want answers? Well, so does he.
[20:27.000 --> 20:35.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[20:35.000 --> 20:38.000]  Watch out, it's hard to do the show right now.
[20:38.000 --> 20:41.000]  I walked out there during the break and one of the crew members, a good friend of mine,
[20:41.000 --> 20:44.000]  and I've known him for like nine years, looked like...
[20:44.000 --> 20:49.000]  Well, he looked super alive. He looked upset.
[20:49.000 --> 20:55.000]  I was like, what's going on? He told me his brother is a friend of mine.
[20:55.000 --> 21:01.000]  Their baby two weeks early died with the umbilical cord wrapped around it tonight.
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  He said the saddest part was seeing his brother's wife hold the baby this morning.
[21:05.000 --> 21:12.000]  And I said, you need to get back down to LeBronfels. You need to get out of here. You need to go.
[21:12.000 --> 21:19.000]  It just hit me how precious life is and how precious my little 11 month old daughter is, how sweet she is with an angel.
[21:19.000 --> 21:27.000]  And then what abortion does and then how they sell the body parts and how on one hand we know how precious children are.
[21:27.000 --> 21:37.000]  And if a man shoots a woman who's six months pregnant, he gets a double, double homicide count against him.
[21:37.000 --> 21:43.000]  But when the government does it, it's okay. And I'm not here judging people who've had abortions.
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  That's how they get you in the trap is, you know, you've had abortions, you've been involved in abortions.
[21:47.000 --> 21:54.000]  I have. The media then goes, Jones is a hypocrite. He admits he's been involved in abortions and he's against him.
[21:54.000 --> 22:01.000]  Yeah, it's called the space time continuum. It's called when I was a teenager, I did bad things and I pledged to never do it again and I haven't.
[22:01.000 --> 22:09.000]  I got four children and I think my lucky stars every time they're healthy and they're born and then I just I have nightmares about it.
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.000]  I have serious guilt.
[22:13.000 --> 22:20.000]  Anytime I think about the globalist killing me or something bad happening, I just think about the children and I have no fear, just zero.
[22:20.000 --> 22:25.000]  When I think about what I've done.
[22:25.000 --> 22:31.000]  I mean, if someday I'm in some globalist prison and they're torturing me, I deserve it because of what I did to my children.
[22:31.000 --> 22:47.000]  I'm a murderer. I've paid money. I've killed 10 of my children that I know of murdered them.
[22:47.000 --> 22:57.000]  The difference is I'm sorry and I know I'm wrong and I repent.
[22:57.000 --> 23:00.000]  And I was young and stupid.
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  And I believe the propaganda.
[23:02.000 --> 23:05.000]  And most of the girls wanted to have the abortions, but a couple of them didn't.
[23:05.000 --> 23:11.000]  I think about those magic children I'd have today, but you know what? I wouldn't have the children I have today if I hadn't had children back then.
[23:11.000 --> 23:16.000]  It's all part of life. So I don't judge you. God judges you.
[23:16.000 --> 23:24.000]  And it's the heart that matters.
[23:24.000 --> 23:34.000]  But you think about the Satanist and these globalists, they love it. They love it.
[23:34.000 --> 23:50.000]  When I first went out and covered and then ended up being part of anti-abortion demonstrations in Austin back in the mid nineties,
[23:50.000 --> 24:02.000]  I remember how scared the women were going in those places of not of us 100 yards away, but of what they were about to do.
[24:02.000 --> 24:04.000]  And once they get them in there, they pressure them to do it.
[24:04.000 --> 24:11.000]  And those women don't even know they can be paid between 50 and $300,000 to have the baby through an adoption agency.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  And then they'll get the person a job afterwards.
[24:14.000 --> 24:20.000]  And there's more people wanting to adopt every year than there are even abortions. People don't know that. There's a whole market.
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  But the globalists want those kids dead.
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.000]  And the left always says, nobody wants black babies.
[24:27.000 --> 24:33.000]  And then the left fights to make sure whites can't adopt blacks so they can kill them.
[24:33.000 --> 24:38.000]  And that's what Margaret Sanger did. It's what the left is. The left is the real KKK.
[24:38.000 --> 24:43.000]  I don't just say that. The Democratic Party is the most upset it is right now.
[24:43.000 --> 24:50.000]  The Democratic Party today is the most upset it's been about the reassurgence and free market and nationalism.
[24:50.000 --> 24:55.000]  They're the most upset they've been since the end of the Civil War when slavery got abolished.
[24:55.000 --> 25:02.000]  Think about that. That's not a statement or a bumper sticker. That's who these crazy people are.
[25:02.000 --> 25:14.000]  And we go out to these abortion clinics and the pro-abortion people would show up and they always had satanic tattoos on them.
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  They always were like, drugged out, looked like their soul was sucked.
[25:17.000 --> 25:20.000]  They could be black. They could be white with their skin. Looks kind of green.
[25:20.000 --> 25:25.000]  You've seen the videos and they just go, eh. And they're not even trying to act like they're possessed to freak us out.
[25:25.000 --> 25:31.000]  They are just whacked out of their minds and they always go, we love murdering children and we love it.
[25:31.000 --> 25:37.000]  We're going to keep killing them and we love Satan and I love killing my own babies and I've killed a lot of them.
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.000]  You'll see like, you know, the little wannabe vampire pig guy.
[25:40.000 --> 25:44.000]  You know, they're going, yeah, I've paid for hundreds of boys. I love it. It's my religion.
[25:44.000 --> 25:50.000]  And that is who they are. And they're there with black tarps coming and trying to block our signs.
[25:50.000 --> 25:56.000]  And it's like, not an art project for them. You couldn't try to look that evil and soul sucked.
[25:56.000 --> 26:02.000]  It's real because even the tarp papers all wrinkle and they're kind of making hardly, lift their arms up to do it.
[26:02.000 --> 26:05.000]  And they love how they're desiccated and soul sucks.
[26:05.000 --> 26:10.000]  It's like, oh, we love how ugly we are and how much we smell and how we hate our, we want to murder children.
[26:10.000 --> 26:18.000]  And this is on video. And you're like, oh, my God, this is real.
[26:18.000 --> 26:22.000]  These people really don't have an operating system that's in this universe with God.
[26:22.000 --> 26:39.000]  They are jacked into like Avatar by Slimer on PCP and it's just amazing to see that.
[26:39.000 --> 26:49.000]  And it's amazing to understand that the name of the video is Communist Attack Alex Jones at anti-abortion protest.
[26:49.000 --> 26:54.000]  That's the name of the video.
[26:54.000 --> 26:59.000]  And it's just incredible to see what these people are like.
[26:59.000 --> 27:03.000]  And then to know they're the people running YouTube, Facebook and Twitter.
[27:03.000 --> 27:06.000]  We have the behind the scenes videos. They're the ones.
[27:06.000 --> 27:11.000]  They hate Christians. They hate God. They hate free market. They hate success.
[27:11.000 --> 27:14.000]  And you're like, but you're working in the power structure.
[27:14.000 --> 27:21.000]  And they just giggle at you because they're just completely twisted.
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  I got to take this phone call.
[27:23.000 --> 27:26.000]  Yeah, roll some of this video. Roll some of this video.
[27:26.000 --> 27:30.000]  Go ahead and roll some of the Satanist showing up.
[27:30.000 --> 27:38.000]  On today's world, abortion supporters routinely attend pro-life rallies and attempt to bully activists.
[27:38.000 --> 27:49.000]  If you have a problem and need a smelly group of commie devil worshipers, maybe you can call the 18.
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  How many did I insult? I killed my kids.
[27:51.000 --> 27:55.000]  I killed my kids.
[27:55.000 --> 28:00.000]  One f***ing friend was faced with a f***ing veil that doesn't stand for women's rights.
[28:00.000 --> 28:03.000]  Hey, we saw your Facebook with your communist hammer and sickle.
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  That's pretty cool, man.
[28:05.000 --> 28:08.000]  Is that you on the Facebook?
[28:08.000 --> 28:12.000]  Is there a Facebook page of you with a hammer and sickle?
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  I don't think so.
[28:14.000 --> 28:17.000]  I don't understand it. I f***ing love it.
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  How do you get your abortion space?
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  I pay for that.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  How many pay for it?
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  Upwards of 50.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  Oh, yeah.
[28:34.000 --> 28:36.000]  F*** you, you piece of f***ing s***.
[28:36.000 --> 28:38.000]  Bunch of misogynistic motherf***ers.
[28:38.000 --> 28:40.000]  Take your mail privilege somewhere else.
[28:40.000 --> 28:41.000]  What's up, are you being aggressive?
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  I'm being aggressive.
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  Get him, son!
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  Wow!
[28:47.000 --> 28:53.000]  That's some guys that attack outside.
[28:58.000 --> 29:01.000]  Water is the single most important thing your body needs,
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  so you want to be sure it's the best for you and your family.
[29:05.000 --> 29:09.000]  Since 2005, thousands have depended on Berkey purified water.
[29:09.000 --> 29:13.000]  The Berkey guy provides the lowest price filtration systems in every size,
[29:13.000 --> 29:17.000]  for incredibly delicious water now and in an emergency.

[29:27.000 --> 29:31.000]  The answer to being in control of your own health care is
[29:31.000 --> 29:33.000]  freedom from insurance.
[29:33.000 --> 29:36.000]  Become part of a group of self-pay patients that come together
[29:36.000 --> 29:38.000]  to share in each other's medical expenses.

[29:41.000 --> 29:43.000]  and $347 for families.

[29:45.000 --> 29:47.000]  Holistic treatments may be eligible for sharing.
[29:47.000 --> 29:48.000]  See guidelines.

[29:54.000 --> 29:58.000]  That's libertyoncall.org.
[29:58.000 --> 30:01.000]  I want to plow into all of this.
[30:01.000 --> 30:04.000]  But I'm going to spend a few minutes here first
[30:04.000 --> 30:07.000]  just encouraging listeners to understand that
[30:07.000 --> 30:11.000]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books
[30:11.000 --> 30:16.000]  or videos or other material from infowarstore.com,
[30:16.000 --> 30:18.000]  you are funding the revolution.
[30:18.000 --> 30:20.000]  I mean, I cannot say it any clearer.
[30:20.000 --> 30:23.000]  And so it is essential that you purchase the products
[30:23.000 --> 30:24.000]  at infowarstore.com.

[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  and their satanic pedophile armies.
[30:51.000 --> 30:52.000]  And that's who they are.
[30:52.000 --> 30:54.000]  And they know we know who they are.
[30:54.000 --> 30:55.000]  And they're coming back against us,
[30:55.000 --> 30:58.000]  so we need your support.
[30:58.000 --> 31:00.000]  Mike and Arizona are on the air worldwide.
[31:00.000 --> 31:01.000]  Go ahead.
[31:01.000 --> 31:04.000]  Oh, Alex, you can rent any day of the week.
[31:04.000 --> 31:06.000]  Thank you, sir, for doing what you do and being a patriot
[31:06.000 --> 31:08.000]  and doing your best to save America
[31:08.000 --> 31:10.000]  and encouraging us as fellow patriots
[31:10.000 --> 31:13.000]  to do that in our local areas as well.
[31:13.000 --> 31:16.000]  And as a longtime infowars listener,
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.000]  I want to say thanks for the awesome brain force,
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.000]  Anthroplex.
[31:20.000 --> 31:23.000]  My girlfriend would like to say thanks for the Anthroplex, too.
[31:23.000 --> 31:24.000]  Thank you.
[31:24.000 --> 31:26.000]  I use the Biotru Selenium, the super blue toothpaste
[31:26.000 --> 31:29.000]  for you folks who aren't big, normal toothpaste fans.
[31:29.000 --> 31:31.000]  The super blue is awesome.
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  And thank you so much, Alex, for the infowars life products.
[31:34.000 --> 31:35.000]  They are quality.
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  I can't wait to get some more.
[31:37.000 --> 31:39.000]  And thank you so much for doing that for us
[31:39.000 --> 31:40.000]  to keep us healthy.
[31:40.000 --> 31:41.000]  Absolutely.
[31:41.000 --> 31:44.000]  Because then we could all, as educated patriots,
[31:44.000 --> 31:46.000]  help our other countrymen and women
[31:46.000 --> 31:49.000]  understand that there's a bigger problems going on.
[31:49.000 --> 31:51.000]  And if we can get our houses in order
[31:51.000 --> 31:53.000]  and be good to each other and ourselves,
[31:53.000 --> 31:59.000]  we can make our country back.
[31:59.000 --> 32:01.000]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen.
[32:01.000 --> 32:02.000]  And I make it really easy.
[32:02.000 --> 32:04.000]  We went out and looked at what the top
[32:04.000 --> 32:06.000]  new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy
[32:06.000 --> 32:09.000]  for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it.
[32:09.000 --> 32:12.000]  And we created a stronger formula
[32:12.000 --> 32:14.000]  than some of the best-selling formulas out there.
[32:14.000 --> 32:15.000]  It's very simple.
[32:15.000 --> 32:17.000]  We went out and looked, look, what is the top?
[32:17.000 --> 32:18.000]  What is the best?
[32:18.000 --> 32:19.000]  We'll just put even more product in.
[32:19.000 --> 32:20.000]  We'll make it better.
[32:20.000 --> 32:22.000]  Leading competitors, but $2 a product in it.
[32:22.000 --> 32:23.000]  $2.60.
[32:23.000 --> 32:26.000]  We put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[32:26.000 --> 32:28.000]  It's $19.95 right now.
[32:28.000 --> 32:30.000]  So you get an incredible top-of-the-line
[32:30.000 --> 32:33.000]  new tropic for $19.95.
[32:33.000 --> 32:35.000]  Believe me, when we're selling it for $35 on average,
[32:35.000 --> 32:37.000]  we need that $15, $20.
[32:37.000 --> 32:38.000]  We make the fund this operation
[32:38.000 --> 32:40.000]  in the face of the global threat of it.
[32:40.000 --> 32:42.000]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it
[32:42.000 --> 32:43.000]  coming in in two weeks.
[32:43.000 --> 32:46.000]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in.
[32:46.000 --> 32:48.000]  And I want people that haven't tried Brainforce
[32:48.000 --> 32:50.000]  to try it and find out why it's got
[32:50.000 --> 32:52.000]  $6,000 plus five-star reviews.
[32:52.000 --> 32:53.000]  It's amazing.
[32:53.000 --> 32:55.000]  Infowarsstore.com, InfowarsLive.com,
[32:55.000 --> 32:58.000]  or AAA-2533139.
[33:02.000 --> 33:05.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:05.000 --> 33:11.000]  Avorted babies incinerated to eat in UK hospitals.
[33:11.000 --> 33:15.000]  Silent green, ladies and gentlemen, is made out of people.
[33:15.000 --> 33:19.000]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace
[33:19.000 --> 33:22.000]  in order to fuel hospitals in the UK.
[33:22.000 --> 33:24.000]  They're being sacrificed on the altar
[33:24.000 --> 33:27.000]  of efficiency and prosperity.
[33:27.000 --> 33:32.000]  What is the secret of Silent Green?
[33:32.000 --> 33:34.000]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[33:34.000 --> 33:37.000]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  Because of its enormous popularity,
[33:39.000 --> 33:42.000]  Silent Green is in short supply.
[33:42.000 --> 33:45.000]  Remember, Tuesday is Silent Green Day.
[33:45.000 --> 33:48.000]  The supply of Silent Green has been exhausted.
[33:48.000 --> 33:51.000]  You must evacuate the area.
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  Okay, it's silent green.
[33:53.000 --> 33:56.000]  It's important to rule that the shareholders of PepsiCo,
[33:56.000 --> 33:58.000]  Big Builder Bird Group company,
[33:58.000 --> 34:02.000]  are not allowed to know what they're using
[34:02.000 --> 34:04.000]  the baby parts for and the flavoring,
[34:04.000 --> 34:05.000]  but we already know.
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  So enjoy the flavor.
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  We're going to get the real solution,
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  which is going to be a combination of death panels
[34:11.000 --> 34:12.000]  and sales taxes.
[34:12.000 --> 34:14.000]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[34:14.000 --> 34:16.000]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[34:16.000 --> 34:17.000]  I'm for regular suicide.
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[34:19.000 --> 34:20.000]  Is spending a million dollars
[34:20.000 --> 34:23.000]  on that last three months of life for that patient,
[34:23.000 --> 34:27.000]  would it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers
[34:27.000 --> 34:30.000]  and to make that trade-off in medical costs?
[34:30.000 --> 34:32.000]  But that's called the death panel,
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[34:34.000 --> 34:38.000]  They told me to say that they were sorry,
[34:38.000 --> 34:49.000]  but that you had become unreliable.
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[34:51.000 --> 34:54.000]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children
[34:54.000 --> 34:56.000]  will do it to its senior citizens.
[34:56.000 --> 34:59.000]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[34:59.000 --> 35:02.000]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police,
[35:02.000 --> 35:04.000]  on its army, on its prison guards,
[35:04.000 --> 35:08.000]  on the quizlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[35:08.000 --> 35:11.000]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  The scoops are on their way.
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  The scoops are on their way.
[35:15.000 --> 35:19.000]  I repeat, the scoops are on their way.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  You will find out why
[35:21.000 --> 35:22.000]  Soylent Green means life.
[35:22.000 --> 35:24.000]  You will find out why
[35:24.000 --> 35:26.000]  Soylent Green means death.
[35:26.000 --> 35:27.000]  We've got to stop them.
[35:27.000 --> 35:28.000]  Come on.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  This is the secret of Soylent Green.
[35:32.000 --> 35:38.000]  Soylent Green is people.
[35:38.000 --> 35:42.000]  It means they will be breeding us like cattle for food.
[35:42.000 --> 35:45.000]  You've got to tell them.
[35:53.000 --> 35:54.000]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen.
[35:54.000 --> 35:56.000]  If you just watched or listened to that piece
[35:56.000 --> 36:00.000]  we put together like four years ago,
[36:00.000 --> 36:05.000]  that is real-world hospitals being heated with baby parts,
[36:05.000 --> 36:09.000]  fetuses being used for the production of vaccines,
[36:09.000 --> 36:15.000]  cosmetics, flavor testing for Pepsi.
[36:15.000 --> 36:22.000]  Mixed with the 1970s sci-fi film Soylent Green.
[36:22.000 --> 36:26.000]  So you see how we're here.
[36:26.000 --> 36:28.000]  And we don't have to be here.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  It's not a dystopia.
[36:30.000 --> 36:35.000]  They're making it a dystopia.
[36:35.000 --> 36:41.000]  And it's very, very critical that we become conscious of this.
[36:41.000 --> 36:44.000]  You know, I started the broadcast out with all the huge news we've got
[36:44.000 --> 36:50.000]  with the fact that we now know,
[36:50.000 --> 36:52.000]  because now the public's paying attention
[36:52.000 --> 36:54.000]  to what the big tech companies have been doing,
[36:54.000 --> 36:57.000]  that they are the royalty.
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  They are the new aristocracy.
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.000]  And that they are completely above the law.
[37:04.000 --> 37:08.000]  Judicial Watch has got more documents where they are kept
[37:08.000 --> 37:17.000]  in private, gilded government paid for facilities.
[37:17.000 --> 37:20.000]  And that it expanded under Obama with the government jets
[37:20.000 --> 37:21.000]  and everything else.
[37:21.000 --> 37:24.000]  And that the tech companies have been merged
[37:24.000 --> 37:30.000]  with the Democratic Party as a breakaway civilization.
[37:30.000 --> 37:36.000]  And that's now Fox News reporting on that, calling it that.
[37:36.000 --> 37:38.000]  A new government, a new civilization,
[37:38.000 --> 37:46.000]  a whole other technological separate gilded group.
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  Now, you know, they got this Netflix show about the Maharajee,
[37:49.000 --> 37:52.000]  you know, out in Oregon and all the rest of it
[37:52.000 --> 37:54.000]  and all the nightmare sex cult stuff
[37:54.000 --> 37:57.000]  and it's tied into Ariana Huffington and the rest of it.
[37:57.000 --> 38:01.000]  That's nothing compared to Google.
[38:01.000 --> 38:04.000]  The Google execs come into rooms of the other executives
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.000]  in an amphitheater and then everyone has to chant
[38:07.000 --> 38:13.000]  you are a golden dragon, you are an ornate building.
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  You go, well, that's silly.
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  No, that's not silly.
[38:17.000 --> 38:21.000]  That's a Jim Jones Kool-Aid drinking drill.
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  You know, they did Kool-Aid drinking drills
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  three times a day.
[38:24.000 --> 38:25.000]  They did it thousands of times.
[38:25.000 --> 38:28.000]  And finally, when it was a real Kool-Aid with a cyanide,
[38:28.000 --> 38:31.000]  bye-bye, everybody gulped it down.
[38:31.000 --> 38:34.000]  And that's what the left's doing with all of this is
[38:34.000 --> 38:37.000]  Kredo saying we're going to take the word fatherland
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  or motherland out of the national anthem
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  and now we're not going to have mother on forums.
[38:41.000 --> 38:42.000]  It's hurtful.
[38:42.000 --> 38:43.000]  Say that again.
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  Imagine the science fiction movie in the 50s
[38:45.000 --> 38:48.000]  where in the future the word mother is illegal.
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  Remember, I should tell you that one day
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  there will be a conspiracy theory that women
[38:52.000 --> 38:55.000]  ever had uteruses or had babies or that breasts
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  were mammary glands and produced milk.
[38:58.000 --> 39:02.000]  That's the asexual world that the UN envisioned
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  before it was even founded.
[39:04.000 --> 39:07.000]  That's in Brave New World Revisited, the nonfiction book,
[39:07.000 --> 39:08.000]  1961.
[39:08.000 --> 39:12.000]  I keep going back to that because you can go read
[39:12.000 --> 39:15.000]  the brother of the head of the World Eugenics Society
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  saying my brother taught me all this.
[39:17.000 --> 39:18.000]  This is their plan.
[39:18.000 --> 39:19.000]  They're going to end the family one day.
[39:19.000 --> 39:22.000]  Their goal is to basically have the family broken up
[39:22.000 --> 39:24.000]  by the year 2000.
[39:24.000 --> 39:27.000]  Well, they're behind, but boy, they're trying to catch up.
[39:27.000 --> 39:28.000]  You understand?
[39:28.000 --> 39:34.000]  This is real, folks.
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  And they attack it from saying get rid of the family
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  at one level or bring in 10 million Muslims
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  and let them date your nine-year-old daughter
[39:40.000 --> 39:44.000]  and have the Swedish government put out a manual
[39:44.000 --> 39:55.000]  on adult men with minor daughters.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  Yeah, in fact, the government of Alberta has now
[39:57.000 --> 40:00.000]  banned the words mother and father in schools.
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  You don't use it.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  And you're like, wow, that's next level.
[40:04.000 --> 40:07.000]  It has nothing to do with a man that wants to take hormones
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.000]  and wants to be a woman.
[40:10.000 --> 40:12.000]  There are people inclined that way.
[40:12.000 --> 40:15.000]  I'm a libertarian. That's your issue.
[40:15.000 --> 40:18.000]  You just, once you can't criticize that
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  or even use the word, I mean, Twitter calls us.
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  Facebook calls us and they say, we don't care.
[40:23.000 --> 40:26.000]  You're not allowed to use the word tranny.
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  We don't care if you're not even attacking those people.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  We've got the recordings back there.
[40:30.000 --> 40:31.000]  We recorded them.
[40:31.000 --> 40:32.000]  And I'm sitting there in these phone calls
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  and Rob's using these phone calls,
[40:34.000 --> 40:37.000]  our news director going,
[40:37.000 --> 40:41.000]  that is a term created by that community
[40:41.000 --> 40:44.000]  and it's free speech anyways.
[40:44.000 --> 40:48.000]  And Facebook said in 2017 and Twitter,
[40:48.000 --> 40:52.000]  they had a meeting and decided they were banning.
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  You understand, that's these tech giants.
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  They sit around and they go, well,
[40:56.000 --> 40:59.000]  we're going to have a big contest in 2019.
[40:59.000 --> 41:02.000]  We're going to have a big global vote.
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  And she's that way.
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  If the people vote that they want words banned,
[41:06.000 --> 41:07.000]  then we'll do it. No, no.
[41:07.000 --> 41:10.000]  It is dangerous speech that is the protected speech.
[41:10.000 --> 41:13.000]  Political speech that is the most protected.
[41:13.000 --> 41:14.000]  They're going to have a vote.
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  Google and Facebook and Twitter next year.
[41:16.000 --> 41:23.000]  They've announced it on banning the words he and she do do do do do do do.
[41:23.000 --> 41:30.000]  Q. Up the music for Twilight Zone.
[41:30.000 --> 41:33.000]  And people will act a bunch of crazy liberals on them.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  Universities, they're not.
[41:35.000 --> 41:38.000]  That's where they're getting the brainwash core
[41:38.000 --> 41:39.000]  to go out and man all this.
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  But it's already coming out with AI,
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  algorithms, all the other systems.
[41:43.000 --> 41:48.000]  They're getting rid of everything.
[41:48.000 --> 41:55.000]  And if they can ban mama or dad or he or she,
[41:55.000 --> 41:58.000]  they can ban it all.
[41:58.000 --> 42:01.000]  Next stop, the New World Order Zone.
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  This isn't fiction. It's a real place.
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  You're living in it right now.
[42:08.000 --> 42:11.000]  Breakaway civilization has siphoned off human ingenuity
[42:11.000 --> 42:16.000]  and technology to build separate reservations for the elite
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  who believe they're about to merge with machines
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  and live forever.
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  Next stop is the Info War.
[42:23.000 --> 42:24.000]  Next stop is, do you care?
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  Because you're being told what's going on.
[42:26.000 --> 42:27.000]  You see it now.
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  And that's why they have to destroy me.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  And why they're throwing everything evil they've got at us right now
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  to censor us and take us down and block us and you name it.
[42:37.000 --> 42:42.000]  It's because they're making their big move.
[42:42.000 --> 42:45.000]  This is it.
[42:45.000 --> 42:46.000]  Now we come back.
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.000]  We've got a lot of incredible news that we need to get to.
[42:49.000 --> 42:52.000]  Trump saying pull out of Syria.
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  That is in countermanding with each state.
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  This is huge, really good news.
[42:56.000 --> 43:07.000]  Stay with us.
[43:57.000 --> 44:01.000]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60-plus products,
[44:01.000 --> 44:03.000]  we have it in Full War's life.
[44:03.000 --> 44:04.000]  It'd take hours.
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  Michael's DX Plus now has a lower price.
[44:06.000 --> 44:07.000]  It's stronger.
[44:07.000 --> 44:09.000]  It's the other equation in probiotics.
[44:09.000 --> 44:12.000]  It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[44:12.000 --> 44:13.000]  It's back in stock.
[44:13.000 --> 44:16.000]  The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  It's got the preglonone.
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[44:20.000 --> 44:23.000]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  So you can upload it in our latest product.
[44:26.000 --> 44:31.000]  It goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine 4-5 toothpaste.
[44:31.000 --> 44:34.000]  It's super blue silver immune gargle.
[44:34.000 --> 44:35.000]  It's a spray you do.
[44:35.000 --> 44:36.000]  You can also swallow it.
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.000]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more.
[44:41.000 --> 44:43.000]  Without you, we couldn't do it.
[44:43.000 --> 44:48.000]  So thank you all for remembering infowarstore.com and remembering that it's not just you
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  And it's so essential to spread the word.
[44:53.000 --> 45:22.000]  And thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[45:24.000 --> 45:28.000]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[45:28.000 --> 45:33.000]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier
[45:33.000 --> 45:34.000]  as you can possibly get.
[45:34.000 --> 45:36.000]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family,
[45:36.000 --> 45:39.000]  and you owe it to the future of this country in the world
[45:39.000 --> 45:44.000]  that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you can be.
[45:44.000 --> 45:49.000]  Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the next level
[45:49.000 --> 45:51.000]  and to be healthy and as focused as you can be.
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world.
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  Now it's time to change our bodies.
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  With Z-Field, infowarslife.com.
[45:58.000 --> 46:04.000]  InfoWarslife Brainforce Plus is our number one selling product by Leafs and Bounds,
[46:04.000 --> 46:05.000]  and for a good reason.
[46:05.000 --> 46:09.000]  Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling new tropics were,
[46:09.000 --> 46:11.000]  what were most popular, what were best, what people liked,
[46:11.000 --> 46:13.000]  and we made it even stronger.
[46:13.000 --> 46:18.000]  Then we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup.
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.000]  We only have 150%, and then it helps funder operation.
[46:22.000 --> 46:25.000]  Well, now it's 50% off.
[46:25.000 --> 46:31.000]  That means we've got a 25% markup, and we've got it paired with the real red pill
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  that takes about seven days to kick in.
[46:33.000 --> 46:35.000]  Brainforce takes about 30 minutes.
[46:35.000 --> 46:38.000]  But the two go together, it's the mind and body challenge.
[46:38.000 --> 46:45.000]  They're both 50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping
[46:45.000 --> 46:48.000]  with the combo at infowarslife.com.
[46:48.000 --> 46:52.000]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers
[46:52.000 --> 47:21.000]  are about to sell out infowarslife.com to get your Brainforce Plus and real red pill today.
[47:22.000 --> 47:26.000]  I want to get into the really good Syrian news and why it's so seismic in a moment.
[47:26.000 --> 47:30.000]  But first, just getting back to what I covered at the beginning of the broadcast.
[47:30.000 --> 47:39.000]  Sarah Silverman, Charlie Chaplin in the old days, John Cleese, Monty Python,
[47:39.000 --> 47:42.000]  they all dressed up like Hitler and made fun of Nazis.
[47:42.000 --> 47:47.000]  And nobody said, hey, you shouldn't be able to do that.
[47:47.000 --> 47:53.000]  And the Democrats compare anybody who isn't a total globalist leftist to Nazis
[47:53.000 --> 47:58.000]  and say, you're racist.
[47:58.000 --> 48:02.000]  And then if we make real parallels to the youth march and George Soros,
[48:02.000 --> 48:05.000]  a real Nazi collaborator who's the main funder of it,
[48:05.000 --> 48:06.000]  I mean, that's a direct line.
[48:06.000 --> 48:11.000]  And then David Hogg's clicking his heels and turning and doing fascist style salutes.
[48:11.000 --> 48:15.000]  He'll clicking?
[48:15.000 --> 48:19.000]  So it's getting more and more bizarre.
[48:19.000 --> 48:24.000]  And then they're banning videos or articles on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube that show that
[48:24.000 --> 48:28.000]  and won't even let you upload the original videos.
[48:28.000 --> 48:35.000]  It's mind blowing that we're seeing these parallels.
[48:35.000 --> 48:38.000]  And they're saying, we can't do that.
[48:38.000 --> 48:42.000]  And then Hillary gets up on the stage and says, Trump is attacking the press
[48:42.000 --> 48:43.000]  or the press is under attack.
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  No, they attack Trump.
[48:45.000 --> 48:46.000]  He speaks back.
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  That's not attacking the press.
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  The mainstream press is trying to get rid of free speech,
[48:50.000 --> 48:55.000]  trying to shut down anybody that's in competition with them because they can't handle the truth.
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  The lie has to suppress the truth.
[48:57.000 --> 49:02.000]  Historically, that's Hitlerian to the maximum.
[49:02.000 --> 49:08.000]  Taking the guns is what the authoritarians did.
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.000]  It's what they do.
[49:12.000 --> 49:16.000]  It's how our country got founded was the red coats coming to take the guns.
[49:16.000 --> 49:22.000]  But now, oh, you get some young adult survivors or something who come out when everybody's rights.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.000]  And so, oh, you can't talk back to them.
[49:25.000 --> 49:26.000]  You have to let them do whatever they want.
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  You have to give up your right to them.
[49:28.000 --> 49:31.000]  You have to give up your free speech.
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  Think about that.
[49:33.000 --> 49:34.000]  That is so dangerous.
[49:34.000 --> 49:36.000]  That is happening.
[49:36.000 --> 49:46.000]  And the media just wants to sneak this in, kind of slide it under where nobody kind of notices this big, massive thing they're doing.
[49:46.000 --> 49:52.000]  And they've chosen info wars as the poster child to misrepresent what we are,
[49:52.000 --> 49:58.000]  to then sell the idea of banning people from the Internet or banning people's speech.
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  But notice Laura Ingram.
[50:01.000 --> 50:07.000]  Laura Ingram, very smart, intellectual, good lady.
[50:07.000 --> 50:14.000]  She rightfully goes, oh, look at Hog, you know, whining that he can't get into four colleges.
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  Which that's a pretty weird thing to talk about.
[50:16.000 --> 50:17.000]  I can't get into colleges.
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  Well, your grades must not be good enough.
[50:19.000 --> 50:20.000]  So is he like saying that?
[50:20.000 --> 50:23.000]  So maybe Harvard should give you an honorary degree then.
[50:23.000 --> 50:26.000]  She apologizes for that.
[50:26.000 --> 50:30.000]  And of course, loses more sponsors.
[50:30.000 --> 50:35.000]  Let them know what idiot publicist is advising her.
[50:35.000 --> 50:38.000]  And Hog goes, I do not accept your apology.
[50:38.000 --> 50:47.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we put up a video over the weekend of him cussing and yelling and saying he hates adults.
[50:47.000 --> 50:55.000]  And he's just like a super horrible thug like brat is how he behaves.
[50:55.000 --> 51:00.000]  And there's new video that vice put out of him very proud.
[51:00.000 --> 51:07.000]  But if we play it and say, man, this is really thug like, it'll be banned because he is the new royalty.
[51:07.000 --> 51:08.000]  He has free speech.
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  He can call me a piece of SH, you know what?
[51:10.000 --> 51:11.000]  He can call me a con man.
[51:11.000 --> 51:12.000]  He can call me a piece of crap.
[51:12.000 --> 51:19.000]  He called me a whole bunch of names.
[51:19.000 --> 51:25.000]  But I'm not allowed to say, wow, you just picked your heels, dude, in front of a giant crowd of people.
[51:25.000 --> 51:26.000]  They're shaking.
[51:26.000 --> 51:27.000]  We're coming to get them.
[51:27.000 --> 51:32.000]  Get us an actual taking a mile on and on and on.
[51:32.000 --> 51:36.000]  And then we've got these profanity lace videos coming up next hour.
[51:36.000 --> 51:44.000]  New ones where Hog just goes off for like 30 minutes like, well, he's scum out there saying I'm a crisis actor.
[51:44.000 --> 51:45.000]  We need to shut them up.
[51:45.000 --> 51:46.000]  See how that works?
[51:46.000 --> 51:51.000]  Remember when he was on with the head of Axios on C-Span on Monday?
[51:51.000 --> 52:00.000]  The Axios guy goes, there's people like M4s and Alex Jones that are saying nobody died and you're a crisis actor.
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  See, because Axios knows I could sue them for that.
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.000]  So they slip it in there a little bit slicker.
[52:08.000 --> 52:13.000]  Because with Axios and Gruber and all these guys, it's how to con people.
[52:13.000 --> 52:19.000]  How do we get up here and lie and get something over on somebody yet again?
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  So it's the craziest thing.
[52:21.000 --> 52:28.000]  You got an 18-year-old young man and a bunch of other people funded by Soros, a real Nazi collaborator on record.
[52:28.000 --> 52:35.000]  Trying to take our Second Amendment, the country got started over.
[52:35.000 --> 52:44.000]  And we're not even able to supposedly criticizing. That means the censorship is already here, folks.
[52:44.000 --> 52:46.000]  And it's getting more intense by the day.
[52:46.000 --> 52:51.000]  And then we're all supposed to conform, I guess, because then we won't have access to the Internet.
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  We won't have access to our friends.
[52:53.000 --> 53:01.000]  That's how they get you addicted and then locked in to their Internet ghetto that Matt Rudge warned of.
[53:01.000 --> 53:07.000]  Two years ago in this studio, right over there.
[53:07.000 --> 53:12.000]  Such a rare interview. I think I'm going to put a plaque on the wall, actually, over there.
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  I almost had a heart attack when he walked in on Matt Rudge.
[53:16.000 --> 53:22.000]  In one interview every couple of years, like, oh, I just won the golden ticket at Charlie's Chocolate Factory.
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  Anyways, the truth is, I'm a libertarian.
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  Anybody that really listens knows what we stand for.
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  They know it makes perfect sense.
[53:28.000 --> 53:38.000]  And that's why they want to stand, because they can't deal with it and they want to shut you up.
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  I would love to see her go.
[53:40.000 --> 53:46.000]  David Hogg says Laura Ingram should be booted from Fox News if changes are not made.
[53:46.000 --> 53:50.000]  Wow, David Hogg says, get her off the air.
[53:50.000 --> 53:51.000]  Yes, take the rights.
[53:51.000 --> 53:57.000]  Just like David Hogg's got seeing in, trying to take me off the air.
[53:57.000 --> 54:01.000]  And so my son this morning, he's off for Easter.
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  He said, I want to come into work.
[54:03.000 --> 54:04.000]  I want to challenge Hogg.
[54:04.000 --> 54:05.000]  My son's in the Daily Mail, you name it.
[54:05.000 --> 54:10.000]  Video's gone viral of him challenging Hogg to a debate.
[54:10.000 --> 54:11.000]  Almost no direction.
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  I wasn't even there when my son shot that.
[54:13.000 --> 54:16.000]  It's gold, better than I do.
[54:16.000 --> 54:19.000]  Oh, and by the way, some of the leftists are online saying, he's a child.
[54:19.000 --> 54:20.000]  His father's using him.
[54:20.000 --> 54:21.000]  Get him off.
[54:21.000 --> 54:26.000]  Oh, I see George Soros can get people that are 17 years old, 18, have them go do what he wants.
[54:26.000 --> 54:36.000]  But my real son, who wants to be on air, he doesn't get to have history speech.
[54:36.000 --> 54:37.000]  Oh, I see.
[54:37.000 --> 54:43.000]  Isn't it terrible how Alex Jones uses his son to go out and interview people on the street
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  and to then challenge Hogg?
[54:45.000 --> 54:46.000]  Why?
[54:46.000 --> 54:47.000]  Why?
[54:47.000 --> 54:48.000]  He's a conservative.
[54:48.000 --> 54:49.000]  He's a Christian.
[54:49.000 --> 54:50.000]  Rex is a libertarian.
[54:50.000 --> 54:52.000]  He doesn't have a right.
[54:52.000 --> 54:53.000]  Why?
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  Don't compare the left to Hitler.
[54:55.000 --> 54:58.000]  We only compare everybody to Hitler for no reason with no evidence.
[54:58.000 --> 55:06.000]  When we're in in fascist uniforms with armbands, clicking our heels and turning in military leadership,
[55:06.000 --> 55:08.000]  it's okay.
[55:08.000 --> 55:12.000]  Don't compare it because I'm the new public figure.
[55:12.000 --> 55:19.000]  I'm the new liberal Messiah, David Hogg, and I have free speech that nobody else does.
[55:19.000 --> 55:28.000]  And if I want to wear skinny black ties and white shirts with dark armbands and click my heels
[55:28.000 --> 55:34.000]  and get funded by George Soros, a literal Nazi, then it's okay.
[55:34.000 --> 55:38.000]  Because I am the great and powerful Oz.
[55:38.000 --> 55:44.000]  I am the great and powerful, incredible.
[55:44.000 --> 55:56.000]  His Majesty David Hogg.
[55:56.000 --> 55:59.000]  That's where we are in 2018, ladies and gentlemen.
[55:59.000 --> 56:02.000]  Now, I haven't gotten to the good news yet, and I will get to Oz.
[56:02.000 --> 56:05.000]  It's incredible what Syria means, why it's so critical.
[56:05.000 --> 56:11.000]  Hillary, you know, and they're like, I never thought there'd be a Holocaust for Jews in America.
[56:11.000 --> 56:14.000]  Now, with Trump, it's like, oh, my God, exactly.
[56:14.000 --> 56:19.000]  His son-in-law is a Orthodox Jew, and he's recognizing Israel and is a Israel first year.
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  Oh, my God, the Nazis are everywhere.
[56:21.000 --> 56:27.000]  Meanwhile, they dress up like Nazis and have them go support Trump.
[56:27.000 --> 56:30.000]  Democrats get caught doing that.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  Oh, that's okay.
[56:32.000 --> 56:40.000]  But boy, don't you compare George Soros' little piglet.
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  Don't you talk about that public figure that's shaking in their boots.
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  They're afraid to debate me.
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  They said that on another show.
[56:49.000 --> 56:52.000]  They're like, by the way, they're afraid to debate me.
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  They can dish it out, but they can't take it.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  They're all shaking in their boots.
[56:56.000 --> 56:59.000]  At least they're shaking in their boots.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  Let me click my heels for you.
[57:01.000 --> 57:05.000]  And then, if we talk about that and say, that's a little creepy.
[57:05.000 --> 57:12.000]  Oh, no, we're going to have to ban you off Twitter, Facebook, or wherever because you don't criticize.
[57:12.000 --> 57:29.000]  David, the savior of the liberals, Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.

[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  You want to stop tyranny? Well, so does he.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:33.000]  That's Guy. It's a bird. It's a plane. It's the flaming wreckage of China's first space station.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  Tiangong-1, a.k.a. Heavenly Palace, was launched by China in 2011, but it was pretty much immediately plagued by technical difficulties,
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000]  which culminated in March of 2016 when China completely lost communication with the satellite.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:58.000]  So over the last two years, this 8.5-ton chunk of metal has been tumbling in over and getting closer and closer to Earth.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  And now, the European Space Agency and American corporations, such as the Aerospace Corporation,
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000]  say they have more or less pinpointed the exact time that it will land.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:16.000]  And this is within 36 hours of April the 1st. The European Space Agency says March 30th to April 2nd.
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  So while they've been able to more or less pin that down, they cannot say yet as to where it will land.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  Because of the speed that's traveling, 17,000 miles an hour, even just a slight miscalculation or a slight change in the atmosphere
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:39.000]  means it could land pretty much anywhere on Earth, specifically between 43 degrees north and 43 degrees south
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  in latitude, as that is the orbital range of this flying piece of scrap metal.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  Now, the 8.5-ton piece of metal is about the size of the school bus. It's pretty much impossible to accurately pin down
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  exactly where it will land. However, if you do want to keep an eye on it, you can go to the Aerospace Corp's website
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000]  where they have a re-entry dashboard.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:11.000]  Now, most of the scientists are quick to point out just what a small chance of being hit by a piece of debris is.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:23.000]  Most of it will be burned up upon re-entry. However, there will be, they say, a 1,240-mile-long by 43-mile-wide path of destruction
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  as the satellite breaks up and scatters its parts all over the face of the Earth, wherever it happens to land.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  If you do happen to be in the path of this falling satellite, they say keep away from it because there is a chance that
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:45.000]  not all of the fuel will be burned up and that the pieces that fall to Earth will be contaminated by highly toxic
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  and corrosive jet fuel, rocket fuel, called hydrazine.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  But still, they say that the chance of you actually getting hit is about one in a trillion.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000]  Now, that's what they say, your chance of getting hit. I don't know what the chances are of somebody getting hit.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  I can say that my chance of winning the Powerball is one in a trillion, but the chance that somebody will win the Powerball
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  is significantly higher. However, they're not giving us numbers to determine exactly what that probability is.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  However, as you can see from this diagram, there's no shortage of cities with a population over one million in the potential path
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  of this falling debris.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  So there is a danger that this is going to land in a populated area, mostly because the Chinese lost any ability to control the path down.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:43.000]  If you remember the Skylab in the 1970s, that was a space station that America had crashed to the Earth after some technical malfunctions.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:49.000]  However, they were able to more or less control the path and try to steer it away from populated areas.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  That's not an option with this satellite.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  The strange thing is that this is not the first time this year that falling space debris has been an issue for China.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  Let's look back to launch of the Long March 3B carrier rocket on February 12th.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  Now that was launched in China and as you can see from the video, you see these booster rockets fall off.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000]  You've probably seen that before if you've seen other rocket launches in America.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  The space shuttle or other such rockets, they would typically do it over the ocean and the boosters would fall into the water.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  The SpaceX came up with this brilliant idea to have the boosters actually land themselves in this beautiful sort of ballet of technology.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  Well, the Chinese will not bother with such conventions.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:46.000]  Now, what they've decided to do is just let the boosters go wherever they happen to land, which happens to be this time on some peasants' houses.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]  Now, they go ahead and just launch it over a populated countryside.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000]  That's only half the report. It's on infowars.com right now. It's powerful. Stay with us.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:02.000]  You know, if I tried to sit here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we haven't infowars live. It'd take hours.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:10.000]  Michael ZX Plus now has a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the yeast, the mold, the candida.
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:15.000]  It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.000]  It's got the preglonone. That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins and amino acids.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:32.000]  So you can upload it. And our latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified toothpaste is super blue silver immune gargle.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]  That's a spray you do. You can also swallow it.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:41.000]  It's a supplement with iodine, super high quality silver, and a lot more. Without you, we couldn't do it.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:49.000]  So thank you all for remembering infowars.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already awake, but it's other people that aren't awake.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:54.000]  It's so essential to spread the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we are back live. We are broadcasting worldwide. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  I ended up spending most of the last hour getting into the incredible free speech crackdown happening on Google, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and every other leftist controlled tech giant.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:55.000]  And it's all over the news and new judicial watch documents. You name it about how Google, Facebook, and Twitter were merged with the White House.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  They had government lavish facilities, five star private jets, everything. We already knew all that.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:25.000]  Google is based in old NASA bases. Google is NASA. Google is a division of the whole space command grid.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  And that's the deep state. And Trump is in there and Trump is now understanding this. And Trump is now going to move on.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  But Google has the NSA satellites. It has the NASA systems. It has everything.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000]  And now look, the Washington Post is panicking. That's that's Jeff Bezos' mouthpiece.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  Congress wants to drag Google and Twitter into Facebook's privacy crisis.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  Gee, because they've all been doing what they've been doing just as bad.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  Well, you just think Zuckerberg is the only one breaking in your cell phone and stealing all your data?
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  With AI computers, Google wrote the book on it. Twitter does it. Twitter reads your private messages.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  Microsoft just told everybody in their terms of service, you got any Microsoft devices on your television, your computer, your Xbox, your Kinect.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:31.000]  We're going into your computer and we're going to read all your private messages and we're going to watch all your private videos and everything you got stored on there.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  Hey, I'll give it to the South Koreans, you know, three years ago. They were more honest.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000]  They said, we're listening to everything you do in your house. We're selling the data. So watch what you say.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  They actually said watch what you say and what you do.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:52.000]  Android's lax app permissions may have allowed Facebook to collect users, call logs and text messages without their knowledge.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  So all that's going on and you've got all these arrogant people that run the algorithms at YouTube and Facebook and Twitter and they've said you're not allowed to make comparisons to David Hogg and to fascism.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  And they're now expanding it. You can't do it to Hillary. You can't do it to Obama.
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  And that's what I saw last night this morning. They've gone in the space of five, six days.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  They started on Saturday banning anybody that compared the youth march funded by the oldest living Nazi collaborator.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:37.000]  Literally. You make a comparison. We're going to block you. We're going to ban you.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  And now the reports are rolling in. You don't do it to Hillary. You don't because it's bullying.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  This is the woman that said she came to a country she saw and he died and then hundreds of thousands died and she put your hottest in power that sell women into slavery.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  She's a political operative, a criminal, huge criminal past.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  But now they're saying, oh, you can't criticize Hillary Clinton now.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  And that's what Hillary was getting to when she was at Rutgers yesterday.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:21.000]  This woman goes, my mother survived the Holocaust and I never thought it could come here, but you know, with Trump and then Hillary's like, yes, yes, and the attacks on the press are very worrisome.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  Trump's not getting rid of the press's freedom. He stands up to them. They punch him. He punches back.
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  Hillary had Google rigging the polls, rigging the questions, rigging the information.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  If you tried to search Hillary death list or Clinton crimes, you couldn't find it.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:55.000]  It's here. So as a culture, we have to make a big deal out of this, but I'll tell you the good news.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:11:09.000]  Trump is figuring all this out and Bezos and Amazon and Google and all of them.
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  He meant just left a month ago. The head of Goldman Sachs is leaving.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  And you see the heads of all these other companies getting ready to leave.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  And Dad's home and, you know, you had a party while he was gone and he tore the house up, but you're in trouble now.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  Just because all these Democrats and globalists took over the whole NSA grid, rolled out all this spy tech system,
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:45.000]  and think they're God and think they're going to censor everybody and think they're going to arrest all their opposition
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  and think they're going to have Antifa, go around and hit people on the head with bike locks,
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:57.000]  and you think you're going to, you know, sue folks for their free speech and pay people to make up
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  for all the standards lies about yours truly. It's not going to work. So Bezos just lost $30 plus billion into one week.
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  That is a man who reportedly is so greedy that he tried to do the death over a nickel.
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  Who who creatures employees the worst in the United States rated.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:25.000]  And then of course, apples even worse, they have suicide nets and forced drugging and forced abortion
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:31.000]  and nightmare facilities in the world.
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  Yeah, Dr. Evil ain't got nothing on Bezos. He's the real Dr. Evil.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  I will destroy the earth unless you give me $30 billion.
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:51.000]  You just thought $30 billion. Would you like $30 billion more?
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:55.000]  Bezos is many me.
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  Well, I can't say David Hogg, he's a public figure and says everyone's shaking in their boots and that, you know,
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000]  he's going to destroy everyone. We've got profanity lace videos coming up.
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  But that's okay because he's a victim. So now whatever he wants, he gets, like he said,
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  I want Laura Ingraham out of there. I want her fired.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:25.000]  Hogg's like, I've already tried to get four colleges. No one's, you know.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  We're like, man, that's a little complaining than a college had let you in.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  Well, I guess he just deserves a degree. In fact, I think they should give him a Harvard doctorate.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  And then Laura Ingraham rolls over in fear and then wonders why more sponsors are leaving
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.000]  and Hogg is now pressing everything because it's not Hogg folks.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  They get up there, they've got their statements. That is hand-done, controlled, incorporated, chapter and verse.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  It'd be like if he was a guitar player, he's heard of playing Stairway to Heaven.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  And I went, hey, you didn't write that song.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Led Zeppelin did. And they went, don't stop that bullying. You don't know that he didn't write Stairway to Heaven.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  And he was like, what are you talking about?
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:23.000]  I know hand-done, controlled, incorporated and violence policy center and Southern Poverty Law Center
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  and all of it verbatim out of all their mouths. It just spews out of it.
[01:14:29.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  They're up there in a Jordan Soros set chanting Democratic Party slogans. That's what they do.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  And it's like, how dare you say no one died and how dare you say he's from California and an actor.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:49.000]  And I'm like, I didn't say that. Yes, you did. Show me. Well, we can't, but we want you banned.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:54.000]  And I'm like, I don't even care if I did say that, which I didn't. I have the right to say it.
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.000]  I don't believe a word comes out of this media. They've been caught lying and staging so much stuff.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  But I think the school shooting happened from my own research and talking to other students.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  I knew there was a stand-down. We first reported that.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  And what were the videos YouTube took down saying I was bullying hog, saying nobody died or he was a crisis actor?
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:20.000]  It wasn't that. It was students, real students saying there was a stand-down.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  And boy, three days after the shooting, they didn't want that out in the news.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  Of course, now everybody knows it. I'm going to stop and discipline myself. I'm done.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:40.000]  I just cannot believe this is a coordinated disinformation operation with a bunch of globalists inside Bezos' operation.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  You name it. The New York Times, The Washington Post, CNN trying to kill the First and Second Amendment.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  And I'm not going to sit there and stand and take it. And instead of bowing to this bullying, we need to double down.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  Stay with us.

[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000]  ID Stronghold was the first to pioneer RFID blocking technology.

[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.000]  They use their media to assassinate real news.
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.000]  They use their schools to teach children that their president is another Hitler.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:10.000]  They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award shows to repeat their narrative over and over again.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000]  And then they use their ex-president to endorse the resistance.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:21.000]  All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and sexism and xenophobia and homophobia,
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:28.000]  to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.000]  until the only option left is for the police to do their jobs and stop the madness.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:38.000]  And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for their outrage.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:49.000]  The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:19:17.000]  I'm the National Rifle Association of America and I'm Freedom's Safest Place.
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:23.000]  We put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60, we put $10 in it and sell it for $30.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  It's $19.95 right now.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  So you get an incredible top of the line Neutropic for $19.95.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:36.000]  Believe me, when we're selling it for $35 on average, we need that $15, $20 we make to fund this operation and to face the global threat of it.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:40.000]  But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:47.000]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in and I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and find out why.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:50.000]  It's amazing.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:55.000]  InfowarsStore.com, InfowarsLive.com or AAA-2533139.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:02.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:21.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host Alex Jones, who claims that 9-11 and the Oklahoma City bombings were inside jobs.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:29.000]  I don't know what happens in somebody's mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that.
[01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  The Russians ran an extensive information war campaign against my campaign to influence voters in the election.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:59.000]  And then they began to weaponize them and they began to have some of their allies within the Internet world like Infowars take out pieces and began to say the most outrageous, outlandish, absurd lies you can imagine.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]  But Trump doesn't challenge these lies.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:07.000]  He actually went on Jones's show and said, your reputation is amazing.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  I will not let you down.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:13.000]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:21.000]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:25.000]  Hillary Clinton has no instincts.
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:27.000]  Zero.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000]  She thought that the media should attack Trump to make him the dominant candidate.
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  This is in the emails, the WikiLeaks, show that he'd be easier for her to beat.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:41.000]  But of course, instinct wise, we knew he was the only one that could beat her.
[01:21:41.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  She's so stuff-suit, so establishment, so OCD.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:50.000]  And then they thought, let's use Alex Jones against Trump in the campaign.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  And all the numbers showed it only made Trump more popular.
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:56.000]  And only made us more popular.
[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.000]  And still, it's the John Podesta playbook that was admittedly written for Hillary, The Darkheart Speech,
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:07.000]  announced the alt-right and said, I'm the biggest enemy and I've got to be taken down and we're all Nazis.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:10.000]  And the same blueprint, a year and a half later, two years later, we're still under.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  And they just don't stop.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000]  And they just go with the same line.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:17.000]  Just like they said that I said nobody died at Sandy Hook when I didn't say that.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000]  I did a devil's advocate debate. They clipped it.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000]  They say I say nobody died at Parkland.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:27.000]  It's just, John Podesta's not even in charge anymore, but the left is still at their command stations going,
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000]  hey, Empress Hillary, what do we do? Well, the last order came in about two years ago.
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:37.000]  We just keep repeating this stuff over and over again. Nazi Hitler banned their speech.
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:42.000]  No one died at the thing.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  Hillary didn't fall down.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:47.000]  Hitler, Nazi, Nazi Hitler.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  Racist, racist, misogynist.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.000]  And it's so cult like you go to Hillary's Twitter, there's no men.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.000]  It's just all women and only what women are doing and how women are the answer.
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  And men are bad. We're a species.
[01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:06.000]  Imagine if you try to see TV shows going, you know, it's the male killer whales that are bad.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:08.000]  Or, you know, it's the male woodpeckers you can't trust.
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:12.000]  You'd be like, male woodpeckers, it's a species.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:16.000]  We don't go, you know, it's the female black widows you got to worry about.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  Actually, they are the ones that are more venomous.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]  And they do kill their husband as well.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:24.000]  He ties her legs before he makes with her.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.000]  That's part of the ritual that gets her excited.
[01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:34.000]  He says that he ties her legs up and then he does the deed and runs away as quickly as possible.
[01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:42.000]  Well, she needs his protein, that meal for making the eggs.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:49.000]  But to survive on the finish, can he get away quickly without being eaten by his dearly?
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:57.000]  Anyways, Hillary looking like a demon goblin is the best way to describe it.
[01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000]  Looking a bit long in the old thing.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  She had a lot to say where he's at the moment.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:06.000]  But first, Trump, this is so seismic.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.000]  Just like last year, everybody's like, oh, Trump's going to invade Syria and he's not going to pull out
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.000]  and follow the agreement that we made with the Russians years ago.
[01:24:15.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  And I said, funny, he told me that no, that's a bunch of bull, we're going to get out of there.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:21.000]  Rep stabilize it first.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:25.000]  And now he's come out and he's done that and he said those exact things.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  And it shows the neocons, everybody else, that have been trying to not let him know the real situation on the ground
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:34.000]  because it is so incredibly complex.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.000]  I study it all the time and I can barely keep track of it.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000]  But Trump sees right through it and is going with the agreement.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  So we've got the President Clinton and Dempsey made five years ago with the Russians
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000]  in counter-valence of the leftist Obama shadow government.
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  There was basically a Patriot Deep State checkmate move where Obama was told,
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  we're not going to be Al-Qaeda's Air Force, how dare you Benghazi, how dare you give the missiles to Al-Qaeda.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:05.000]  So they rebranded ISIS to confuse everybody.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:06.000]  But Trump saw through that.
[01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  You saw through that.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:13.360]  saw through it. The military saw through it. And so now Trump these years later is really
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:18.000]  trying to stabilize things and really trying to pull out of the country and saying we're
[01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:22.900]  not going to be in the middle of this. And that is the agreement was made with the Russians
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:29.360]  by the military blocking Obama and the globalist expansion. And by the way, the Russians said
[01:25:29.360 --> 01:25:34.080]  you better make this deal because we're going to fight you in Syria. We let you do Libya.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:38.880]  We let you do Iraq. We know you're destabilizing everything to destabilize the Russian border.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:42.240]  We're not going to let you do it. And our military said, you know what? You're right.
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:48.480]  This is really crazy. Why are we helping Al Qaeda and ISIS anyways? And history happened.
[01:25:48.480 --> 01:25:55.920]  So now Trump is actually following the deal that was made that's moral. But he's also
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:01.440]  telling Iran you sit down and shut up and you stop starting fights. And if you come back
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:05.760]  into Syria and you try to destabilize it yourself, we're going to, we're going to bomb you. How
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:10.880]  does that sound? He told Saudi Arabia, you sit down, you stop it, we're going to overthrow
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:11.880]  you.
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:18.400]  And now the backing of aliens, they go, Trump's weird. He wants stabilization. That's weird.
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:24.200]  That was our policy until the 70s, until the mid 60s. The US didn't used to be Dr. Evil
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:30.560]  just running around being pure evil. I mean, the Spanish Empire had already collapsed for
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:42.320]  100 years. The US is like, we'll take it and then free market economics. But that's it.
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:51.840]  But now we become this globalist empire. So we'll see if Russia plays nice on that front,
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.200]  but there are major escalations. This is a major de-escalation and shows Trump is really
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:01.960]  dealing fair. And it stunned the Russians that he actually said he's going to do anything.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:05.880]  Now watch what the globalists do. They're going to pull something, some new crisis, but we'll
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:10.360]  see what happens. Here's what the president said about this yesterday.
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:13.400]  And by the way, we're not going to the hell out of ISIS. We'll be coming out of Syria
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:19.280]  like very soon. Let the other people take care of it now. Very soon. Very soon. We're
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:25.480]  coming out. We're going to have 100% of the caliphate, as they call it. Sometimes referred
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:30.000]  to as land. We've taken it all back quickly, quickly.
[01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:35.480]  And of course, he goes into speech. We've spent $7 trillion in the Middle East. I was
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:39.440]  against the destabilization operation that the globalists launched. Iraq, that's what
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:44.960]  he's saying. And we're going back to the pragmatic stabilization model. And we're not going to
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:50.160]  be part of this weird, crazy globalist operation anymore to try to put radical Muslims in charge
[01:27:50.160 --> 01:27:58.680]  of Europe and Eastern Europe and Asia so you can bring down Russia with, let the Muslims
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:03.240]  take over and have all the nuclear weapons. Is that your really dandy idea?
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:10.800]  Let me tell you something. If the West wants to take over Russia, the West just needs to
[01:28:10.800 --> 01:28:14.720]  do economic deals with Russia. But see, the globalists don't want the Russians to be
[01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:20.760]  Christian or have their own sovereignty. Economically, the globalists could be in there like flies
[01:28:20.760 --> 01:28:26.720]  on, you know what, but they don't want that. They want to keep Russia super poor under
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:32.080]  their control, bring it down, and then they can have one more big run just torturing Christians
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:37.040]  and stomping their guts out. I mean, it was like a liberal playground. American leftists,
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:41.520]  you name it, all the world went to Russia to be part of special units where they could
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:45.200]  just rape and murder Christians. I mean, you know that's what the left wants to do here,
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:48.600]  and that's what they do. They always do it. They just want to get your wife and children
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:29:18.560]  in a room and rape them and blow their heads off. I mean, that's what they do.

[01:30:05.240 --> 01:30:08.880]  new tropics were, what were most popular, what were best, what people liked, and we
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:14.400]  made it even stronger. Then we cut the price, because leading competitors have five to seven
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:22.400]  times markup. We only have 150%, then it helps funder operation. Well, now it's 50% off.

[01:31:00.720 --> 01:31:04.800]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them, and it made a lot of changes in our lives.
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:08.160]  Well, thank you, brother, because it also funds our operation, but doing that, I know

[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:27.720]  off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots, a big ton of money there.
[01:31:27.720 --> 01:31:33.440]  Just from powerful organic herbs, harvested around the planet, and then concentrated,
[01:31:33.440 --> 01:31:38.440]  or maximum potency. They want to stun and dumb down, and energy drinks and stuff, just
[01:31:38.440 --> 01:31:42.400]  cover that up for a while, but then burn you out. In my experience, where stuff that gets
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:46.760]  your glands naturally going goes right to the source. So, it's pretty exciting, and

[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:58.040]  So win, win at infohorselife.com.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:38.680]  Well, I've been wanting to get this lady on for a while. We're going to her in about
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:44.800]  a minute. Katie Hopkins over in the U.K., but she's in the U.S. a lot. Banned off Twitter.
[01:33:44.800 --> 01:33:51.000]  They want her kicked off TV. Now David Hogg wants Laura Ingram off Fox News. Because he
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:55.520]  said, I've tried to get in at four colleges and couldn't, and he said, oh, look, you're
[01:33:55.520 --> 01:33:59.800]  whining. I'm like, oh my gosh, you can't talk bad about a guy that wants to take your right
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:05.320]  because he is a victim. Well, he's an adult. He's projecting onto American gun owners that
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:10.120]  we did something to him. No, the sheriff's department stood down, and the guy was on
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:13.920]  Prozac drugs, and they knew he was planning something, and the whole school said he was
[01:34:13.920 --> 01:34:19.200]  planning something, and the police were told over and over again, and the FBI was told Laura
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:26.160]  Ingram didn't shoot your classmates. I didn't. And it's wrong if somebody else does something
[01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:30.920]  to then say somebody else is the blame. But I guess Katie Hopkins is back on Twitter.
[01:34:30.920 --> 01:34:35.120]  I just always read about her band here, band there. Now they say, look what this woman
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:41.080]  said. Get her off. And then I go here, what she said, it makes total sense because the
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:48.920]  left is going into total censorship mode. She's got a new book out. We'll tell you about
[01:34:48.920 --> 01:34:53.760]  that as well. She's done a lot of things like spending two days and nights on Skid Row in
[01:34:53.760 --> 01:34:57.600]  London, Sissy Hunter right before the outbreak of bubonic plague. You know, that's that's
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:03.640]  happening now. The UK banning American and Canadian activists. Oh, yeah. It's crazy.
[01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:08.800]  Now they haven't started putting out child sex brochures to Muslims like they are doing
[01:35:08.800 --> 01:35:15.440]  now in Sweden. But but they're very, very, very close. And now we're seeing people convicted
[01:35:15.440 --> 01:35:21.960]  and folks facing prison time because they have Hitler dog. Now again, Sarah Silverman,
[01:35:21.960 --> 01:35:26.720]  she can dress up like Hitler and go on TV and make jokes. John Cleese could Charlie
[01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:33.600]  Chaplin could but not conservatives, not libertarians. We're not allowed to not just
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:39.800]  have platforms. We're not allowed to be involved in humor. Only the Hollywood royalty. They
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:46.920]  are the only ones. And if hog clicks his heels and engages in all these activities, it says
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:50.840]  he wants our rights. And it's funded by George Soros, a Nazi collaborator. If we say that,
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:56.040]  we need to be banned because well, that's that's because David Hogg's God, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:35:56.040 --> 01:36:00.760]  So Katie Hopkins, thank you so much for joining us. We're what do you want to tackle first?
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:07.920]  I mean, I just just incredible assault on free speech and first up Laura Ingram, you
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:12.600]  know, one of the really important things is that you never apologize, never apologize.
[01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:16.720]  It only encourages them the minute you come out and say sorry. The first thing they're
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:21.560]  going to say back to you is, Oh, well, your sorry was too late. Oh, your sorry was only
[01:36:21.560 --> 01:36:25.840]  sorry because now you're losing your sponsors. Your sorry wasn't good enough. If you thought
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:30.600]  about what you said, you wouldn't be sorry. So saying sorry never worked. It's the worst
[01:36:30.600 --> 01:36:35.000]  strategy Fox could have adopted to try and protect her. And I think what we need to
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:41.400]  do more of is look for sponsors and commercial partners who are allies who will stand with
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:48.040]  us no matter what our personal views are. I think it's disgusting that certain brands
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:54.560]  like TripAdvisor or Hulu or whatever have decided that in order to appease David Hogg,
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:59.800]  a small child, they will withdraw sponsorship from lovely Laura Ingram who's a fighter.
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:04.560]  She's a foster mother. She's a great woman. And I think these sponsors need to be targeted
[01:37:04.560 --> 01:37:09.440]  in the same way we did with Hannity and others to say, no, you are not going to decide the
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:14.280]  agenda here in this nation. You are just a corporate making money by selling products.
[01:37:14.280 --> 01:37:17.880]  Do what you do and sell your products and shut up.
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:21.880]  You're absolutely right. But I happen to know the inside baseball on Fox and the coup they
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:25.440]  had with Ailes and then how they got rid of O'Reilly and how they're trying to get rid
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:31.480]  of Hannity. The Suns want to segue it into being more like CNN. They've said that they're
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:36.200]  liberals. Look at Fox programming the rest of it. It's very globalist. I mean, look what
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:41.720]  it does there in the UK. So it's kind of a mixed bag, but they want to act like these
[01:37:41.720 --> 01:37:48.000]  hosts are getting destroyed because of their own action. And they want to be able to intimidate
[01:37:48.000 --> 01:37:52.840]  their host to convince their audience to kind of do what Glenn Beck did and sell out.
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:57.920]  So that's the process is they want Fox News to basically kill itself, but they don't want
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:02.600]  to get the blame. And so that's why they have these corporate guys advise them to do something
[01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:07.160]  which they know just like Tiger Woods apologizing will destroy them. So Laura Ingram is being
[01:38:07.160 --> 01:38:10.600]  marched in front of a firing squad by Fox. Go ahead. Sorry.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:15.240]  No, you're fine. I agree with you. Absolutely. In fact, and many of the times that I've worked
[01:38:15.240 --> 01:38:20.440]  on various outlets when I have my own radio show, you know, it's the most performing best
[01:38:20.440 --> 01:38:25.680]  listened to commercial radio show. And then your bosses love the fact that you're the
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:31.240]  best performing show that you have the most listeners. But the moment any kind of flashback
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:36.200]  happens, any kind of, you know, horror story, a tweet that I did that nobody liked, whatever,
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:41.240]  the bosses are so quick to run away to say, oh, no, we'll let her go. And I think that's
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:46.600]  it. This whole kind of media, the place we try and base ourselves, you and I, it lacks
[01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:53.320]  spine. It lacks backbone. It lacks the guys that employ you that say, I stand with her.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:56.880]  These are her opinions. We've employed her for them. We're happy with her on the good
[01:38:56.880 --> 01:39:01.240]  days and we'll stand by her on the bad days. And we don't have enough platforms just like
[01:39:01.240 --> 01:39:02.240]  that.
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:06.800]  Well, that's right. And there are a lot of good people at Fox, by the way. And I know
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:11.800]  you do some work with them. I'm sure you have your own inside baseball. It's just that that
[01:39:11.800 --> 01:39:17.440]  is one way that Fox lost a bunch of its viewers about a year and a half ago, but they came
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:22.880]  back because Fox then got more hardcore again. And that's what the people want. And it's
[01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:26.760]  the truth. If you watch Tucker Carlson or watch you or anybody that's on Fox, it all
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:30.400]  makes perfect sense. And that's why people are watching.
[01:39:30.400 --> 01:39:35.720]  I think Tucker is this kind of ray of light. He's kind of my hope in that all of the media
[01:39:35.720 --> 01:39:41.320]  landscape that we have, Tucker is my kind of inspiration for the sort of show that we
[01:39:41.320 --> 01:39:46.480]  know Americans want. And the British people would love a show like Tucker, you know, being
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:51.640]  on the other night with Mark Stein, with Jordan Peterson, I was bringing my report live from
[01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:55.960]  Skid Row. You know, that's the sort of outlet we need where people are just telling their
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:40:00.680]  truth and the American people can decide whether they agree with them or they disagree. Too
[01:40:00.680 --> 01:40:04.960]  many of our media outlets seem to think we need to be able to agree to even show each
[01:40:04.960 --> 01:40:10.840]  other. You know, there was never a bar that said we have to agree before we can even stand,
[01:40:10.840 --> 01:40:16.680]  you know, sit at the table together. We don't need to agree to be able to share our views.
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:19.040]  That's right. I want to go into your book when we come back in the next segment, but
[01:40:19.040 --> 01:40:22.840]  getting into Skid Row, that's pretty dangerous in those dangerous places in the world and
[01:40:22.840 --> 01:40:27.880]  all these leftist cities, wherever they're in control, it is just crap all over the ground,
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:33.560]  needles, things falling apart, disease, like you said, bubonic plague, hepatitis, and you
[01:40:33.560 --> 01:40:37.600]  went and spent several days in the middle of this. And then the media criticized you
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:43.080]  for pointing out it should be cleaned up when you let these giant sores grow. It feeds into
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:46.680]  the crime and they know the demographics. They know the history.
[01:40:46.680 --> 01:40:52.920]  I think two things there. One is that downtown LA fifth and sixth, it's in the heart of downtown
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:56.120]  and yet everyone turns a blind eye. Oh, you don't go there. You don't want to go there.
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:41:00.400]  It's nasty down there. Even the hotels have covered it over on their maps with a sticker.
[01:41:00.400 --> 01:41:06.280]  Like if you don't see it, maybe it will go away too. Democrats love to talk about dreamers
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:12.240]  and sanctuary city because of course it sounds like a spa resort. No, Democrats. The reality
[01:41:12.240 --> 01:41:17.960]  is this is your skid row. This is your mess. And I'm walking around ankle high in human
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.320]  waste, effluent and rats. The rats there are streaming over the road. They gather around
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:27.640]  your ankles. And my point about the bubonic plague is if you look at a description of
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:33.640]  London in the 1600s, right before the outbreak of the bubonic plague, that is skid row now
[01:41:33.640 --> 01:41:38.600]  and tears and sympathy are not going to cut it. We need military action in there. We need
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:44.240]  to clear up those streets and out of respect for people who are truly lost, we need to
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:50.320]  help put them into situations, residents where they can be medically looked after. We shut
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:55.160]  the sanatoriums and we let these people drown and that's not good enough. But I also think,
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:41:58.040]  you know, I wasn't that scared there. I've just come back from South Africa looking
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:01.480]  at the genocide of white farmers in South Africa. They've only got about three years
[01:42:01.480 --> 01:42:06.040]  left. We think that we'll have white farmers still in South Africa. So in a way, skid row
[01:42:06.040 --> 01:42:11.960]  seems relatively friendly compared to South Africa and the white farmers that are being
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:17.760]  killed there. And that's what's wild is I have these farmers on. You talk to them and
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:20.200]  the president saying, we're going to take your land. The communist leader says, we're
[01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:23.560]  going to kill you. The military leader says, we're going to kill you. Then they make jokes
[01:42:23.560 --> 01:42:28.960]  like, Hey, good luck getting out of here. Then they say in the news that the president
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:32.320]  did that. Well, come back and talk about it. It's just incredible. And I want to get your
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:38.640]  take on it that it Australia's racist for offering to take refugee. So it's like, we're
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:43.960]  going to kill you. We're going to take your land. And by the way, you can't escape. I
[01:42:43.960 --> 01:42:48.240]  mean, the black racism is so horrible. Now it's like no quarter. We're going to kill
[01:42:48.240 --> 01:42:51.640]  your men, women and children, and we're not going to let you escape. And if anybody takes
[01:42:51.640 --> 01:42:57.000]  you to the racist, we're going to kill you. Choose to take control of your chemistry with

[01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:05.280]  on mitochondria efficiency and protection. Mitochondria produce over 95% of your energy.
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:10.640]  They are your body's cellular engines. Cell force helps promote your cellular energy production
[01:44:10.640 --> 01:44:16.120]  by supporting mitochondria, much like a cellular engine overhaul. Because when your mitochondria
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:22.680]  don't run at 100% efficiency, then they start producing reactive oxygen species. Top scientists
[01:44:22.680 --> 01:44:27.880]  agree that aging is most likely caused by cellular damage resulting from these reactive
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:33.960]  oxygen species. The antioxidants found in cell force are some of the most powerful available
[01:44:33.960 --> 01:44:38.880]  on the market. The stronger the antioxidant, the better its ability to scavenge for these
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:46.040]  reactive oxygen species and other free radicals. Boost, protect and adapt with cell force from

[01:44:55.360 --> 01:44:59.360]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen. And I make it really easy. We went
[01:44:59.360 --> 01:45:03.760]  out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:09.560]  stamina, mental clarity, you name it. And we created a stronger formula than some of
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:12.720]  the best selling formulas out there. It's very simple. We went out and like, what is
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:16.200]  the top? What is the best? We'll just put even more product in. We'll make it better.
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:21.560]  Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60. We put $10 in it and sell
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:27.400]  it for $30. It's $19.95 right now. So you get an incredible top of the line new tropic

[01:46:49.600 --> 01:47:07.200]  the word. Again, thank you so much for being part of the second American Revolution.
[01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:28.280]  I wanted to get Katie Hopkins on for years and we finally got her. And she want to talk
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:31.880]  about her book that's out. She's going to talk about topics. And every time I see this
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:35.760]  lady, it's just everything she's saying is veritas. It's true. I cover the news every
[01:47:35.760 --> 01:47:39.400]  day. I know what she's talking about. And it's what she gets into the genocide of the
[01:47:39.400 --> 01:47:42.560]  white farmers that happened everywhere else in Africa is now happening again. And the
[01:47:42.560 --> 01:47:48.000]  left is praising it. And I see all the crazy anti white stuff being taught at colleges
[01:47:48.000 --> 01:47:51.840]  and about how whites are inherently evil if you're a white woman, abort your white baby
[01:47:51.840 --> 01:47:56.400]  and major feminist magazines. And then I forgot another reason I wanted to get her on is the
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:04.880]  assassination of Katie Hopkins, state sponsored national theater opening in a Welsh area.
[01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:08.560]  And it's about killing her and she's had an attempt on her life. And don't forget all
[01:48:08.560 --> 01:48:14.680]  the other nationalists that have been killed murdered in Europe. So this is next level
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:18.720]  where Sadiq Khan is having women banned off Twitter, you know, that challenge him about
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:23.200]  genital mutilation. And then Katie Hopkins, because she is empowered, she is strong, she
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:28.280]  is smart. She's a woman. They're saying we want her dead and wanting to have that state
[01:48:28.280 --> 01:48:34.080]  sponsored. It's just like Hillary coming out saying white women voted because their husbands
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:37.640]  told them to. And then Hillary's in the news again yesterday. I've got a clip clip later
[01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:44.640]  whenever she leaves us saying that yeah, these white women are dumb. That is the most bizarre
[01:48:44.640 --> 01:48:50.640]  statement I've ever most condescending. They're saying conservative women aren't voting conservative
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:54.480]  because their husbands told them to they're doing it because they like guns and property
[01:48:54.480 --> 01:48:59.200]  and their executives and they own things and they're in charge. They're the powerful women.
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:03.320]  The leftist women are a bunch of chicken neck idiots in my experience, just like the men.
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:07.640]  Katie, I'm sorry, but it's true. Go ahead. A conservative women are awesome. I want women
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:12.760]  to be powerful and in charge. That's sexy. Sorry. I know. I agree with you so much and
[01:49:12.760 --> 01:49:16.640]  I always feel about this. You know, Hillary Clinton had no hope because she wanted to
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:21.720]  play us all as victims. She wanted women to be victims, Spanish people to be victim, LGBT.
[01:49:21.720 --> 01:49:27.360]  You know, she wanted to be the ambassador for victims everywhere and conservative women
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:33.600]  like myself, white, Christian, conservative women. We always say we stand with Trump because
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:38.360]  we stand up for our right to speak freely. We stand up for your right to bear arms. I'm
[01:49:38.360 --> 01:49:43.600]  a card carrying member of the NRA right now. And I say I would much rather be grabbed by
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:48.120]  the pussies and have a pussy for president. And I'm proud to stand there with my American
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:54.360]  sisters because I know we're strong. Well, and again, they spun this in my whole custody
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:58.800]  battle that I said it was okay for Trump to grab women. But the media misrepresented
[01:49:58.800 --> 01:50:03.120]  that he raped women. Trump was saying like at the Elvis Presley concert, if women are
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:07.720]  climbing on top of you, it's like, wow, they let you do whatever they want. Well, yeah,
[01:50:07.720 --> 01:50:11.480]  that's the point when a woman jumps on you with both arms, their legs around you. That
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:17.000]  means that's a mammal's mating. And so they, again, they semantically spin everything.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:22.000]  That's a hint that we liked you. And never, ever imagine that women are done too. I say,
[01:50:22.000 --> 01:50:28.120]  screw you, me too. I've been very in control of my sexual history. I'm proud of my adventurous
[01:50:28.120 --> 01:50:32.880]  sexual history. And no one's ever grabbed me where I didn't want them to. If I wanted
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:37.080]  to be grabbed, you'd be grabbing me and you wouldn't know why, because I will have manipulated
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:42.080]  you to do it. Women are much tougher, much stronger, much better at this game than men.
[01:50:42.080 --> 01:50:46.920]  And if Trump got lucky a few times with some women with ridiculous boobs down on their knees,
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:52.080]  go Trump. We would rather have someone sexually active who's a regular guy than some politician
[01:50:52.080 --> 01:50:56.680]  who's dry humping a sheep in his back garden because he has no social life. So I stand
[01:50:56.680 --> 01:51:02.000]  with Trump. I tell women Trump's not, Trump's not branding women and Alistair Crowley rituals,
[01:51:02.000 --> 01:51:06.080]  drinking blood and semen. You know, he's got a bunch of kids and been married and in red
[01:51:06.080 --> 01:51:09.400]  blood and I mean, and he never said he was a preacher. If he won't think that he was
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:14.800]  Mr. preacher, and then we calling doing that stuff, he said, this is who I am balance right
[01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.400]  there in the executive. You've got Mike Pence. So if you don't like a guy that's sleeping
[01:51:18.400 --> 01:51:22.800]  with women with huge knockers who call themselves crazy names like Stormy Daniels, then you've
[01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:28.000]  got Mike Pence. Look to him. He's a very straight Christian conservative guy. You've got balance
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:33.320]  there in the executive and women like me too. Where are those women? Where are you for the
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:38.200]  Iran women doing their protests without the burqa? Where are you when I've got assassination
[01:51:38.200 --> 01:51:42.840]  of Katie Hopkins going on? Where are you for the girls who are having their clitorises
[01:51:42.840 --> 01:51:47.840]  ripped off by their family members for their religion? Where are you? Western feminists
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:52.480]  have never been more disappointing. And they want you dead because you're powerful, you're
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:56.960]  vibrant and I'm married. I gotta say, this is pretty, you are pretty sexy. I mean, I
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:00.520]  mean, I like women like, I don't know how to describe it, who were like, feminists want
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:04.960]  to be tough, but they don't get like the women I grew up around or my grandmas or anybody,
[01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:08.680]  you know, like kind of stomping around in charge, but not in charge as they wanted to
[01:52:08.680 --> 01:52:12.960]  be in charge. They were in charge because they were alive and they were awesome. Yeah.
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:16.720]  Well, if you think I'm sexy, I will say, I think you need your eyes tested, but I do
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:20.960]  think strong women are really fun to be around. And the reason my government is sponsoring
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:24.240]  a play. Well, that's what I'm saying. Look, I don't think you look bad. My point is it's
[01:52:24.240 --> 01:52:28.680]  attitudes. What matters? It's you have a light in your eyes. You have light in your eyes.
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:31.880]  I watched all these feminists that were at this feminist meeting with Hillary yesterday
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:36.560]  and they look like they're zombies. It's not that they're even ugly. They look like something
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:42.240]  sucked their soul. The reason the state wants to run the play called the assassination of
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:48.040]  Katie Hopkins is because it would be much more convenient for them if that were true.
[01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:52.600]  One of the things the state loves is fear. They can control people when they're afraid.
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:52:56.840]  When you have someone like me who is not afraid of anyone, not the establishment, not the
[01:52:56.840 --> 01:53:01.560]  state, that's far more dangerous. And they would be much better for them if I wasn't
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:05.880]  around. So we have two jihadi sent down earlier this year because they had practiced beheading
[01:53:05.880 --> 01:53:10.840]  me with a dummy, with a plastic hunting, with a plastic dummy and a hunting knife. So the
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:15.520]  threat against my life is real. And now the state is sponsoring a play called exactly
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:20.360]  that. What would happen if I got a poster with the assassination of Sadiq Khan or the
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:24.480]  assassination of a black politician? How would that go down to using?
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:28.480]  Oh, they would. It would be the biggest hissy fit the planet ever saw.
[01:53:28.480 --> 01:53:32.720]  Absolutely. I would be banned from everything within a moment because it's the assassination
[01:53:32.720 --> 01:53:37.360]  of white Christian conservative woman who's passionate about her country and passionate
[01:53:37.360 --> 01:53:41.880]  about people's right to stand up for their country. It's seen as acceptable and in fact,
[01:53:41.880 --> 01:53:43.880]  wildly amusing for the liberal elite.
[01:53:43.880 --> 01:53:48.480]  Well, I've talked to some top entertainment lawyers in Hollywood and some people in Washington.
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:52.680]  And I said, what is the point of them lying about me and saying all this stuff? And he
[01:53:52.680 --> 01:53:55.600]  said, you don't get it. They're trying to create an atmosphere where Christians and
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:54:00.280]  conservatives and libertarians get killed. They've already done it in Europe. And with
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:04.920]  what they're doing with you saying kill you, that's what this is. I mean, they are literally
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:09.720]  trying to create an atmosphere where they have this political intimidation just like
[01:54:09.720 --> 01:54:12.280]  the Brown church did in Nazi Germany.
[01:54:12.280 --> 01:54:16.880]  We have a situation where Theresa May, for example, our prime minister is getting rid
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:22.400]  of Russian spies from our country or Russian diplomats because of the issue with a couple
[01:54:22.400 --> 01:54:27.080]  of Russian spies being killed. You know, my message to people, if you want to stay alive,
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:31.400]  you don't be a Russian spy. I mean, just an idea for you there. And she moans about
[01:54:31.400 --> 01:54:32.400]  that.
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:37.560]  But the hypocrisy is when they arrest someone like me or a leader of a kind of nationalist
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:41.520]  party, they throw them in our prisons and they let the Muslims at them. We just had
[01:54:41.520 --> 01:54:45.500]  that with Paul Golding from Britain first. Whether you agree with his policies, whether
[01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:49.760]  you hate him, there is no reason why you should be taking a man who's known for standing
[01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:53.800]  up for Britain and throw him in our jails and let the Muslims at him. They just broke
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:59.360]  his face. And that's the way our state gets rid of and dispatches people it doesn't want.
[01:54:59.360 --> 01:55:04.200]  It puts them inside and lets the Muslim population at them. And we had that with a guy who threw
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:09.400]  some bacon at a mosque, which admittedly is a ridiculous thing. He was killed in our prisons.
[01:55:09.400 --> 01:55:13.240]  He never came out again. And that's how they dispatch the people they don't want. So we
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:17.640]  are no better than the Russians. The government dispatches people it doesn't want, just in
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:21.120]  the same way as it's now sponsoring a play for the dispatch of me.
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:25.000]  Well, there's also mafia rules to spycraft and the Russians probably didn't even do this.
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:28.320]  It looks like a false flag. Why would they use a nerve agent track back to them? But
[01:55:28.320 --> 01:55:34.440]  if you're a former GRU colonel and then you defect and give secrets, is it that we kill
[01:55:34.440 --> 01:55:38.520]  traders, right? I mean, I don't understand that. Like, oh my God, they killed one of
[01:55:38.520 --> 01:55:42.280]  our traders. I mean, that's that's again, that's upside down world. That's what they
[01:55:42.280 --> 01:55:43.880]  do here. Sorry, go ahead.
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:47.920]  No, it's fine. You're fine. I'm just agreeing with you really. I think, you know, when we
[01:55:47.920 --> 01:55:52.640]  had this big hella balloon made about kind of a couple Russian spies being bumped off
[01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:57.440]  or whatever, or another guy, a Russian spy that was in paid on railings or found in a
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:02.840]  bag in his bath. Sure, that's going to happen. You know, there is retribution out there in
[01:56:02.840 --> 01:56:07.880]  life if you failed your state, if you failed to stand up for your country, if you're a traitor,
[01:56:07.880 --> 01:56:11.980]  probably you're not going to meet a great end. But it's a typical way of our politicians
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:16.880]  looking away from the problems right on our doorstep and talking about something that's
[01:56:16.880 --> 01:56:21.360]  much more convenient. You know, we don't address the issue of Muslim grooming gangs. We're
[01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:27.440]  not even allowed to say the word Muslim grooming gang. We have to use a euphemism like Asian.
[01:56:27.440 --> 01:56:33.160]  So we throw half of Taiwan, all of the Sikhs, you know, half of China under the bus just
[01:56:33.160 --> 01:56:38.360]  so that we don't offend the Pakistani rapists who are raping our children. We don't want
[01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:40.360]  to give them herty feelings.
[01:56:40.360 --> 01:56:44.080]  Now, I don't want to get this wrong. I'm just going from memory. I'm always reading about
[01:56:44.080 --> 01:56:47.600]  you banned on this, banned on that, but I see your Twitter's up and got close to a million
[01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:51.560]  followers. Tell folks how they can follow you there because I'm a huge fan. People ask
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:56.600]  what I do in my spare time. I watch the videos you're doing, others. And again, we know why
[01:56:56.600 --> 01:56:59.040]  you're so effective because they want to kill you.
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:02.920]  Thank you. So yeah, people, I'm still on Twitter. Twitter has been gracious enough to leave
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:07.560]  me on there, but I'm capital K, capital T Hopkins. That's my Twitter. Please do follow
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:11.800]  me there. All of my stuff is there. I overshare on a regular basis. All my reporting's there
[01:57:11.800 --> 01:57:17.480]  and at Hopkins world.com. And I'm very grateful for this huge army of people that are supporting
[01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:22.360]  me. And I'm going to be speaking at the first anniversary event for the Manchester bombing.
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:27.000]  I will be there. I will be standing up there. It's another speakers corner type event. And
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:31.440]  I will be rallying the people of Britain who know that it's time for us to stand up for
[01:57:31.440 --> 01:57:36.360]  our country and to stop tiptoeing around the cultures that choose to join us and start
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:42.480]  standing up for the culture that they chose to join. Wow. I just love this lady. We'll
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:45.960]  be right back with the third hour a little bit more with our guest. Stay with us. The
[01:57:45.960 --> 01:57:49.800]  reason for his life has five star ratings on major third party sites because I want

[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:08.520]  ever forget to take them, like I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The nascent
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:12.920]  iodine is one of the ones that was life changing for me. Yeah, I've actually have just run
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:18.360]  out of my super female. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again,
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:23.440]  hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling great, looking good. So and I know
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:29.840]  my hair is luxurious once again. So obviously it's super female is amazing. I love it.
[01:58:29.840 --> 01:58:34.520]  Nascent iodine is essential survival shield X two. If there's one product that I would
[01:58:34.520 --> 01:58:39.120]  say is life changing that I would suggest it's nascent iodine survival shield X two.
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:48.000]  It's got a five star rating. It's a win win info wars life.com info wars life brain force
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:52.760]  plus is our number one selling product by leaps and bounds and for a good reason. Going
[01:58:52.760 --> 01:58:56.560]  back about five years ago, we did research on what top selling new tropics were. What
[01:58:56.560 --> 01:59:01.240]  were most popular, what were best, what people liked and we made it even stronger. Then we
[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:06.760]  cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup. We only have
[01:59:06.760 --> 01:59:14.920]  150% and then it helps funder operation. Well, now it's 50% off. That means we've got a 25%

[02:00:00.120 --> 02:00:16.880]  global developments years before they happen right here on the Alex Jones show. All right
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:21.200]  folks, Katie Hopkins is here and she gets me really excited because she's so on target
[02:00:21.200 --> 02:00:26.760]  and I do my customary jumping in. But guess what? She's going to host the next segment
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:31.280]  because I want to hear what her top rated UK show was like before they, you know, tried
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:35.120]  to get rid of it because of what she was up to. But I did miss speaking sort of interviews
[02:00:35.120 --> 02:00:38.360]  saying that she'd been banned on Twitter. I just remember seeing that headline and so
[02:00:38.360 --> 02:00:41.560]  many others have been banned on Twitter. You're going to cover some other key topics in the
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:45.240]  next segment and then I'm going to come back. But I wanted to ask you now, what do you expect
[02:00:45.240 --> 02:00:48.120]  them to do? Because as you pointed out, they're trying to censor you. They're trying to kill
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:52.480]  you. They're trying to block me. They're trying to censor us. Everybody else, but the momentum
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:56.080]  is building against them. This trizan effect is taking place. So what do you think the
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:01:00.840]  globalists, the global left, their, their alliance with Islam as humanity awakens to
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:05.880]  this authoritarian threat, what are they going to do as they understand they're losing more
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:06.880]  and more?
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:12.000]  Well, I think what we need to focus on is not what they're going to do, but what we're
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:17.000]  going to do. And I'm very clear about that. Now they can label us, you and I, Alex, any
[02:01:17.000 --> 02:01:21.480]  other of the network of people that we know we're a part of and we don't need to see each
[02:01:21.480 --> 02:01:25.120]  other. We don't need to stand in a line. We know we belong to this network because we
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:30.920]  can feel it. I feel it with conservatives in America. We're like spiders on an invisible
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:35.960]  web and that web is really strong. And what we do, Alex, is when they call me, all the
[02:01:35.960 --> 02:01:41.840]  names they call me, they call me a racist, an Islamophobe, a bigot, a fascist, a misogynist.
[02:01:41.840 --> 02:01:47.440]  Yes, sure. Okay. I'll be all those things. But guess what? Here I am on Skid Row and
[02:01:47.440 --> 02:01:53.040]  here's my truth. And here's a gentleman vomiting in the street and here I am ankle deep in sewage
[02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:58.560]  and here I am recovering from Hep C. And so they cannot argue with our truths, Alex. And
[02:01:58.560 --> 02:02:03.560]  the more we present to them, our truth. So I spent three weeks in South Africa with white
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:08.840]  farmers and I allow a lady to tell me the story how she was raped by three men or how
[02:02:08.840 --> 02:02:14.240]  a lady whose husband was shot and then her six year old child offered her piggy bank
[02:02:14.240 --> 02:02:19.760]  if the killers would let her mummy live. They cannot argue with those truths, Alex. It doesn't
[02:02:19.760 --> 02:02:25.360]  matter what labels they put on you, our stories will be told and they can't silence that.
[02:02:25.360 --> 02:02:31.000]  And I can feel this resurgence coming. I can feel it in the UK and I will help lead it
[02:02:31.000 --> 02:02:36.120]  and I will help get our country to stop, stand up again.
[02:02:36.120 --> 02:02:42.040]  Wow. I know why they fear you so much and I'm not, listeners know I don't just gush
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:46.960]  over guests constantly, but you're so on target. You're so truthful and there is that spirit
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:51.040]  of us that are nationalist, that are free market and the those that love communism and
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:56.640]  socialism, they just seem like their soul sucked. I'm not just bashing them, just to
[02:02:56.640 --> 02:03:02.080]  bash them. They have existential envy of anything strong and good and want to pull it down when
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:06.760]  they should have the instinct to try to be strong and good themselves. But there's something
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:11.040]  twisted in them and you can't seem to get them to unflip the switch.
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:16.040]  No. And so what we do is we do better than them. Leave them there. Leave those bitter
[02:03:16.040 --> 02:03:21.040]  women over there complaining with their pussy marches and their banners. You know, I watched
[02:03:21.040 --> 02:03:25.840]  them on the pussy marches and I asked them, ladies, tell me, why are you here? And one
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:30.560]  would say, well, I'm here because of global warming. And another would say, I'm here because
[02:03:30.560 --> 02:03:35.440]  my vagina is made of steel. And another one would say, I'm here because I voted Clinton
[02:03:35.440 --> 02:03:39.640]  and this is not my president. And it was like, ladies, you don't even know why you're here.
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:44.320]  And very much like the Parkland school kids, you stop them on the march for our lives and
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:49.240]  say, why are you marching? Oh, we need weapons banned. Why are you marching? Because people
[02:03:49.240 --> 02:03:53.960]  were shot. Why are you marching? Because I really like David Hoff because I like emancipated
[02:03:53.960 --> 02:04:00.280]  boys. Okay, fine. Again, no unified single mission, no clear aim. I think conservatives
[02:04:00.280 --> 02:04:05.840]  have a very clear aim. We want to make America great again. That's a clear unifying aim.
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:11.200]  And in Britain, I want to make Britain great again. And I have a clear aim. And I think
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:14.800]  that's where the left fail. And it doesn't matter what they do, carry on, ladies, bitch
[02:04:14.800 --> 02:04:20.480]  about our president, whatever. I know we're stronger. I know we're better. And I know
[02:04:20.480 --> 02:04:24.880]  we're about working hard to look after our families. And that's a fundamental value.
[02:04:24.880 --> 02:04:29.840]  And the thing with fundamental values is they endure. And that's why we will endure too.
[02:04:29.840 --> 02:04:34.360]  Oh my God, I'm in love. What about the audience? I got to get this lady on more and she didn't
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:38.400]  want to plug it about her book, rude. You can find it online. You can also follow her
[02:04:38.400 --> 02:04:42.960]  on Twitter. She's going to host the next segment. And then I'll be back after that. A real treat
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:47.040]  straight ahead. Katie Hopkins hosting the info war.
[02:04:53.040 --> 02:04:58.240]  I'm so excited. The new product that info wars life.com in a glass bottle, two month
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:04.640]  servings filled to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real Red Bull. This is a
[02:05:04.640 --> 02:05:11.200]  heart and brain pill, a new tropic that doesn't have any stimulus in it. But boy does it stimulate
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:16.640]  because it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors
[02:05:17.200 --> 02:05:21.200]  prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:27.440]  $100, $200 for the formulae. And I came up with our own formula working with some scientists
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:35.120]  and developers non GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen, you add
[02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:40.480]  the preglin own to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body has to have to
[02:05:40.480 --> 02:05:47.920]  even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill now available at info wars
[02:05:47.920 --> 02:06:09.040]  store.com and your purchase of the operation live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting
[02:06:17.920 --> 02:06:41.600]  and welcome back here to the Alex Jones show on info wars. My name is Casey Hopkins. I am
[02:06:41.600 --> 02:06:46.160]  not Alex Jones. If that isn't immediately apparent to you, that's a concern to me.
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:51.040]  I'm hosting this segment for Alex while he's just popped off to do something. And I thought I'd
[02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:55.680]  like to take this opportunity to update you all on some of my journeys and some of my thoughts
[02:06:55.680 --> 02:07:01.360]  over the last couple of weeks. I just came back from three weeks in South Africa. You know,
[02:07:01.360 --> 02:07:05.520]  one of the things that have been worrying me and troubling me, people email me all the time,
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:11.520]  and you're very welcome to email me to my email is Katie at Katie Hopkins.co.uk.
[02:07:11.520 --> 02:07:17.200]  Hey, and I had so many emails from farmers, white farmers in South Africa, particularly
[02:07:17.200 --> 02:07:22.800]  their wives worried about the genocide that is happening there. Essentially, and the gentleman
[02:07:22.800 --> 02:07:29.600]  you can see there is the leader of the kind of terrorist arm, I would say, of the ANC. When
[02:07:29.600 --> 02:07:34.640]  you think about the ANC, the political party leading South Africa, they're headed up by a guy
[02:07:34.640 --> 02:07:41.040]  called Cyril Ramaphosa. He stood there in his state of the nation address a few weeks ago,
[02:07:41.040 --> 02:07:46.960]  and he said, we support land expropriation without compensation. And what that means,
[02:07:46.960 --> 02:07:50.640]  of course, is we're going to take back your land, and we're not going to pay you for it.
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:56.080]  And when you translate that by the guys in those red berries that you see, they were the guys that
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:08:02.000]  tore apart the H&M stores when you saw those rioting pictures. Those are those guys. And
[02:08:02.000 --> 02:08:10.160]  their rallying cries at political forums, their rallying cry is kill the boy, kill the white man.
[02:08:10.160 --> 02:08:15.760]  That's how they chant. And in Parliament, they've been making throat-slitting gestures
[02:08:16.640 --> 02:08:22.960]  against the opposition. Now, if you think about that, the footage you're seeing right there,
[02:08:22.960 --> 02:08:29.200]  that's the EFF supporters, the terrorist arm, as I call them, of the ANC, rioting in H&M. And
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:34.240]  you'll recall that was about a sweater, about a monkey, and they used a black model for it. And
[02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:40.800]  they tore those stores apart. And that's how they do politics in South Africa. It's a very violent
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:46.320]  way of doing politics and how this is translated by the white farmer means. And this is kind of
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:54.720]  brutal. So if you are easily upset, this is brutal. But the people I went to see, they've been attacked,
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:09:00.000]  they are being cleansed from the land. Farm attackers come into their building. If I think
[02:09:00.000 --> 02:09:04.480]  about Bernard, he came back with his family on a Sunday afternoon after a bar, and he was going to
[02:09:04.480 --> 02:09:11.840]  make a barbecue, a bribe for the family. A black gang were waiting for him in his garage. They
[02:09:11.840 --> 02:09:20.000]  strung up his wife with wire. They clubbed to death his father on the floor. Then they took
[02:09:20.000 --> 02:09:26.080]  Bernard's and they hurt him so badly he didn't know if he was being stamped or not. They shot
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:31.040]  at his 11-year-old son and the shot missed, but the boy was dragged across the yard and his little
[02:09:31.040 --> 02:09:35.840]  brother was watching. And his little brother sat in the garage door and watched the whole attack.
[02:09:36.400 --> 02:09:41.760]  He watched his mother strung up. He watched his father, grandfather killed. And he watched his
[02:09:41.760 --> 02:09:47.440]  father take a beating so bad the guy didn't walk. And after all of this, you know, we imagine that
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:54.240]  that is the worst that can happen, but it's not. I sat on Bernard's stoop with him in South Africa.
[02:09:54.240 --> 02:09:59.920]  And I talked to him about his children and this children, this eight-year-old son of his who was
[02:09:59.920 --> 02:10:05.760]  a brilliant boy at school. Everybody loved him. He was everybody's favorite child. Now he cannot
[02:10:05.760 --> 02:10:12.320]  sleep anymore. He's a tortured little boy and he has anti-depressant and he has sleeping tablets.
[02:10:12.320 --> 02:10:16.000]  And Bernard even went back to the doctor and said, I'm sorry, I think you've given him the wrong one.
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:20.800]  Please don't work still. He can't sleep. And the doctor said to Bernard, you go home and take
[02:10:20.800 --> 02:10:25.440]  one of these tablets, his son takes four. Bernard took it and he was out to the camps.
[02:10:25.440 --> 02:10:30.000]  But that's what happens in South Africa. They're destroying not only the white farmers who will
[02:10:30.000 --> 02:10:35.200]  be cleansed from the land within three years, but they're destroying a new generation of children
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:39.520]  who are also persecuted and tortured because of what they've seen done to their family.
[02:10:40.080 --> 02:10:44.240]  Recently, they took a white baby and they threw it into a bath of boiling water.
[02:10:44.240 --> 02:10:50.240]  An 86-year-old lady, while I was in country, they broke into her farm. They plugged in an iron that
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:55.840]  they used to iron clothes and they applied it to the old lady for three hours. And that's what
[02:10:55.840 --> 02:11:00.640]  we're up against and that's what the world doesn't want to talk about. I think, you know, sometimes
[02:11:00.640 --> 02:11:07.120]  racism, we think it can only happen one way. We think it can only happen if you're white. Only
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:14.160]  white people can be racist, but that's not the case. In South Africa, because of apartheid,
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:21.680]  the EFF has given a mandate for vengeance in that country. And that vengeance is so cruel.
[02:11:21.680 --> 02:11:27.440]  That is the rape of a child in front of the farmer, just to take away every last thing he
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:34.000]  has before they shoot him. And because they are white, the world doesn't care. You know, I've
[02:11:34.000 --> 02:11:39.440]  often said the white farmer in South Africa is up there with the white rhino. You know, they both
[02:11:39.440 --> 02:11:45.120]  face the extinction. The white rhino, we just lost the last one. And the only difference is,
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:49.120]  the only difference is that because it's a white farmer, the world doesn't care.
[02:11:49.680 --> 02:11:53.760]  And that's what I found so upsetting. And that's why I'm building my documentary now with rebel
[02:11:53.760 --> 02:11:59.680]  media. And that documentary has footage that nobody else had, because we went to the darkest
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:05.680]  places to find that. I have interviews with a police officer who says that the police work
[02:12:05.680 --> 02:12:12.480]  hand in hand with the black gangs. They help equip the black gangs. They give them the firearms in
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:19.440]  order to take a kickback from the farm attack if they feel something. So the policemen are in on
[02:12:19.440 --> 02:12:25.360]  this. I also got an interview with an actual farm attacker and asked him why he felt it was
[02:12:25.360 --> 02:12:30.560]  appropriate that they could rape three-year-old children in front of their dads. And he said,
[02:12:30.560 --> 02:12:36.080]  well, apartheid. It's time the white people learned their lesson. So that's the real truth,
[02:12:36.080 --> 02:12:42.080]  my truth from South Africa. And I would urge you and encourage you to be involved in that
[02:12:42.720 --> 02:12:48.720]  story. Look at the reporting. Look at the facts from places like Africa 4 and with the statistics
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:55.120]  on what's actually going on in South Africa. This year so far in 2018, there's been 103
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:13:01.920]  farm attacks and 15 murders. And you know, having told you that behind every farm attack,
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:07.520]  there's a child. There's an eight-year-old. There's Bernard's son who can no longer sleep
[02:13:07.520 --> 02:13:13.120]  anymore and has been asked to leave his school because he's now a violent boy. And there's
[02:13:13.120 --> 02:13:20.080]  Maryandra, another beautiful lady I met, whose husband was shot. He died as she buried her
[02:13:20.080 --> 02:13:27.040]  husband. And she gave birth to her first son, his first son, five days later.
[02:13:27.760 --> 02:13:32.880]  Maryandra's daughter, who saw the whole attack, she can't sleep anymore either. And she's on
[02:13:32.880 --> 02:13:38.000]  antidepressants too. So these are the people we want to bring home to. Those pictures you're
[02:13:38.000 --> 02:13:45.600]  seeing there, that plasmord, that's a massive, it's a monument to the white farmers who have died.
[02:13:45.600 --> 02:13:50.800]  And when you go there, it truly is, it breaks your heart because suddenly the individual stories
[02:13:50.800 --> 02:13:58.000]  get lost because there have been so many, many murders. I walked to the top of that mountain
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:02.960]  and stood next to that sign. And it's almost as if in death, you know, these people still
[02:14:02.960 --> 02:14:08.160]  stand together in the fight. And that's the way I see us, you know, as conservatives,
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:12.960]  as Christians, as people who want to stand up for their country, whatever label you have,
[02:14:12.960 --> 02:14:18.720]  libertarian, apolitical, whatever. If you identify as a frog, it doesn't matter.
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:24.560]  What matters is that we stand together. So we need to reach out our hands to each other.
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:29.280]  And even if we disagree a little bit, we don't need to agree on everything.
[02:14:30.000 --> 02:14:35.840]  What we need to agree on is the fact that we love our family. We want to work hard for our family.
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:43.520]  We love our country. We love the people who want to stand up for our country. And then we stand
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:49.440]  together, you know, like these spiders on a web. Sometimes I think conservative commentators, you
[02:14:49.440 --> 02:14:55.280]  know, are big failing. The thing we do wrong is that we chase the story. I see an end to it as
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:15:00.400]  well. Like my son, I've got a nine-year-old son. And when they play football, it's really, really
[02:15:00.400 --> 02:15:06.320]  cute. But they all chase the ball together. They all move around in this little group, all chasing
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:11.280]  the ball. And that's very much like mainstream media right now. They're all chasing the same ball,
[02:15:11.280 --> 02:15:17.040]  the same easy story, a story where they don't have to leave their office or risk themselves or risk
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:23.680]  their health. But we need to be better than that. We mustn't chase the ball. We must look for the
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:29.840]  hardest stories and tell our truth. It really matters that way. And so I encourage all of you
[02:15:29.840 --> 02:15:35.920]  and the thing you can do tomorrow, the action that you can take, start looking for the quietest
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:42.960]  stories. Go to your local council offices. Go to your local member of parliament. Go walk through
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:49.440]  Skid Row. Go find the things that matter. Tell your truth and let's join together. Hold each other
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:54.800]  on this web that we have and we stand strong. Disease is on the rise. Clogged arteries, high
[02:15:54.800 --> 02:16:00.080]  blood pressure and high cholesterol levels may not be fully detected by you. But the symptoms are
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:05.520]  there. Loss of energy, blood sugar, spikes and drops, poor circulation and irregular heartbeat
[02:16:05.520 --> 02:16:10.320]  are just a few of these that can alert you that something is wrong. Hear how heart and body

[02:17:55.040 --> 02:18:00.400]  toothpaste is now back in stock at m4store.com. The first shipment of super blue sold out in one
[02:18:00.400 --> 02:18:04.400]  week. I thought it would be a six-month supply for listeners and since then people are beating down
[02:18:04.400 --> 02:18:09.680]  our doors wanting to be able to resupply their super blue. Research across the board is clear.
[02:18:09.680 --> 02:18:13.920]  In fact, it's certified. When bacteria infect your gums, it can enter your bloodstream,
[02:18:13.920 --> 02:18:17.920]  but if you contribute to blood clots and heart attacks, that's why the last surgeon general's
[02:18:17.920 --> 02:18:22.960]  report on oral health warns that your oral health can have a serious impact on your entire body.
[02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:26.640]  Super blue fluoride free toothpaste is a groundbreaking new formula. It's loaded with
[02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:32.240]  good halogen iodide, so the bad halogen fluoride. Super blue contains natural oils and ingredients
[02:18:32.240 --> 02:18:36.960]  used since biblical times to help wipe out bad bacteria and eliminate bad breath. Just some
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:41.920]  of the ingredients in super blue chosen by our dental experts include silo tall, peppermint oil,
[02:18:41.920 --> 02:18:47.280]  iodide, nano silver and more. Learn more about InfoWarsLife's super blue toothpaste

[02:18:52.080 --> 02:18:57.440]  InfoWarsLife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen blocks.
[02:18:57.440 --> 02:19:02.720]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[02:19:02.720 --> 02:19:09.440]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort and respiratory functions.
[02:19:09.440 --> 02:19:15.440]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[02:19:15.440 --> 02:19:20.880]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses. They began studying this effect in published
[02:19:20.880 --> 02:19:25.840]  trials and decades later, we now have the fruit of this research, a fast-acting,
[02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:31.440]  chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms. Pollen block is natural and
[02:19:31.440 --> 02:19:36.880]  effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact, current research has found that it actually acts
[02:19:36.880 --> 02:19:42.320]  by blocking the activity of triptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory
[02:19:42.320 --> 02:19:48.560]  responses in the body. Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com
[02:19:48.560 --> 02:19:51.440]  and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:58.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:06.160 --> 02:20:11.760]  You found it, the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[02:20:13.440 --> 02:20:19.520]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country.
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:22.240]  Man, I was just thinking about this song five minutes ago.
[02:20:24.560 --> 02:20:28.480]  Oh, Murrell Haggard. That's like a cool mountain spring.
[02:20:29.840 --> 02:20:34.160]  You're thirsty. Crank it up a little bit.
[02:20:42.320 --> 02:20:43.360]  Yeah, they're walking.
[02:20:43.360 --> 02:21:04.800]  You see, the average American that has no idea what goes on behind the scenes,
[02:21:04.800 --> 02:21:11.280]  people try to take this country down. And George Soros, people ask why talk about George Soros
[02:21:11.280 --> 02:21:16.720]  so much because every time I kick down another door, digging into this thing, it's him on the
[02:21:16.720 --> 02:21:23.200]  other side of it. He's got a other group of closely knit globalists and billionaires, but man,
[02:21:24.960 --> 02:21:35.280]  he is just crazy. You imagine being 14, 15, 16 for three years in Eastern Europe and helping
[02:21:35.280 --> 02:21:45.520]  round up Jews because they trusted him. He was Jewish. He was young, looked a little bit younger
[02:21:45.520 --> 02:21:52.240]  for his age. Looked like he was about 12. He wrote a memoir about it. People don't think as a child
[02:21:52.240 --> 02:21:55.440]  is threatening like the children, oh, turn your guns in. We're children. We're children.
[02:21:57.440 --> 02:22:01.200]  And, you know, we've got the 12 minutes, 60 minutes interview and McBrain did a great job
[02:22:01.200 --> 02:22:06.160]  putting together with Hitler clips. But there's one part we says is the best part of his life.
[02:22:06.160 --> 02:22:10.320]  We don't even have that in the clip we play. You know, I think I'm going to air.
[02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:16.000]  I think I'm going to make a documentary about George Soros. I haven't made a film in years.
[02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:24.640]  Just about, I'm not going to say killing George Soros, like killing Katie Hopkins,
[02:22:24.640 --> 02:22:28.080]  because only the left gets to make movies and plays about killing the opposition. I don't want to
[02:22:28.080 --> 02:22:37.040]  kill George Soros. I just want to expose him. And I know in a bunch of the lawsuits they filed,
[02:22:37.040 --> 02:22:41.680]  they'll always have a quote about N. Jones claims George Soros was a Nazi collaborator.
[02:22:41.680 --> 02:22:49.200]  They just put them in the lawsuits, Georgetown and two others as a message. Hey, George, I know,
[02:22:49.200 --> 02:22:54.400]  I know you're coming after me because I keep saying you're a Nazi collaborator. These guys don't get
[02:22:54.400 --> 02:23:02.400]  it. See, if the Nazis told me, go round up your fellow Jews or we're going to kill you,
[02:23:02.400 --> 02:23:08.080]  I'd kill them. That's why the Nazis don't run Texas, boy. We don't roll over like you.
[02:23:10.720 --> 02:23:16.240]  I think high level Hollywood folks years ago go, we really want to put your movie in theaters.
[02:23:16.240 --> 02:23:24.960]  You can make like $5 million dollars. George Soros had to do what he did. He's really not a bad
[02:23:24.960 --> 02:23:30.640]  guy. And I talked to somebody close to him and would you ever want to talk to George Soros?
[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:42.080]  And I'm sitting there and I go, is that an offer? And they're like, do you want it to be?
[02:23:42.080 --> 02:23:48.880]  And then I had another TV movie star on one time.
[02:23:51.680 --> 02:23:53.840]  And he just brought that up during a break. He said, you know,
[02:23:55.680 --> 02:23:59.920]  Soros's sons are not that bad. You know, you ought to stop calling him a Nazi collaborator.
[02:23:59.920 --> 02:24:05.840]  You know, he did what he had to do. So I mean, I get it. Soros has reached out. Well, but, you know,
[02:24:05.840 --> 02:24:13.680]  hey, here's this option, Alex, or there's this option. Hey, Soros, fill your hand, buddy.
[02:24:17.280 --> 02:24:24.160]  Fill it again. I will never sell the truth out. Got it? Ever. And the reason I keep
[02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:29.200]  announcing that is they still haven't figured out that I haven't gotten the message. I got the
[02:24:29.200 --> 02:24:39.120]  message. It's refused. Return to Cinder. No such number. I'm not ever selling anybody out.
[02:24:39.760 --> 02:24:47.520]  And it's not because I'm a hero. It's because I know God's real. See, Soros, I fear God. I don't
[02:24:47.520 --> 02:24:53.920]  fear you. And I know you wrote that book and you gave interviews, Shang. I knew I was the Messiah
[02:24:53.920 --> 02:25:00.080]  when I was a young man. But they lock you up for that. So I didn't want to tell anybody until
[02:25:00.080 --> 02:25:14.320]  I've shown everyone. Oh, you're showing us. You're showing us your son tweets photos of him
[02:25:14.880 --> 02:25:21.200]  at spirit cooking events in the middle of the spirit cooking controversy. Alexander Soros,
[02:25:21.200 --> 02:25:30.640]  your aid to camp, your air, your protege, your chosen one, that thing with crazed little demonized
[02:25:30.640 --> 02:25:43.360]  every photo seething with the insanity. That is your warmock. That's your battleship. That's the fruit.
[02:25:43.360 --> 02:25:51.200]  I mean, you're not a tall cold drink of water yourself, but your son sure as hell ain't.
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:26:01.120]  God, oh my, look at you. Finally found some people you couldn't intimidate.
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:04.080]  Finally found some people you couldn't push around.
[02:26:04.080 --> 02:26:15.360]  Finally found some people they're going to roll over to your crap. Yeah, that's what you found.
[02:26:19.280 --> 02:26:23.440]  And I noticed I didn't really, I'm learning so much more like exponentially now because
[02:26:23.440 --> 02:26:26.400]  you just get the knowledge and then it all starts connecting and that's the wisdom.
[02:26:27.600 --> 02:26:30.960]  You know how people operate and how these groups operate. It's like it is criminology.
[02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:39.600]  And when you pull back from it
[02:26:42.400 --> 02:26:46.000]  and you study it and you look at it,
[02:26:50.080 --> 02:26:55.600]  it's amazing. Then you see the whole thing at that point
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:02.080]  and you see their plans and everything and it's the people's unconsciousness and their inaction
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:11.680]  that allows this stuff to go on. It's the weirdest thing. I like grass the whole thing
[02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:17.840]  and then it's like I'm not supposed to say it because it's not time for it to come out and
[02:27:17.840 --> 02:27:26.160]  then it wipes and I can't even tell you. It's the craziest thing but wouldn't Soros and all the rest
[02:27:26.160 --> 02:27:38.400]  of them like to know, wouldn't they? But I didn't know what was going on. A year and a half ago
[02:27:38.400 --> 02:27:42.400]  we exposed the spirit cooking and the Aleister Crowley stuff and then they were all bragging
[02:27:42.400 --> 02:27:46.480]  about it everywhere and then they all sort of tweeting and celebrating the high priestess
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:52.720]  and I'm just like oh oh oh oh oh she's great look at her oh oh oh like this is your god this crazy
[02:27:52.720 --> 02:27:59.680]  woman and then you realize how weak these people are. They sold out to evil because they're scared
[02:28:02.080 --> 02:28:06.000]  and that's what it is fundamentally and they don't understand I'm not scared. I'm not
[02:28:06.560 --> 02:28:12.640]  and they know that and they can't stand it because if you're tied into the spectrum of their
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:19.200]  their system you pick up on the mental illness and the confusion it's like it's like having the
[02:28:19.200 --> 02:28:26.000]  flu or a fever it's like hallucination it's real broken up and not that it's the opposite of the
[02:28:27.200 --> 02:28:32.000]  that still quiet place of the most high that Psalms talks about
[02:28:34.560 --> 02:28:39.040]  and then you realize oh my god they're all just totally confused and don't even know what they're
[02:28:39.040 --> 02:28:45.040]  doing. They see order and want to pull it down because they're disordered and then you're like
[02:28:45.040 --> 02:28:49.120]  do they even realize the shadow of the huge mountain they're next to that's God?
[02:28:51.520 --> 02:28:56.480]  Face it today's electric power grid is more vulnerable than ever. From natural disasters to
[02:28:56.480 --> 02:29:02.320]  EMP attacks and hacking the grid could be crippled for days or even decades in the most dire scenarios.

[02:31:19.040 --> 02:31:24.000]  shield x2, supermail, vitality and so many others with its unique delivery system and
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:29.920]  proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects. This formula is the platinum
[02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:35.600]  standard of multivitamin mineral products and this part is most important. The ingredients in
[02:31:35.600 --> 02:31:41.920]  vitamin mineral fusion are either plant derived or of the highest quality lab standard. That means
[02:31:41.920 --> 02:31:46.800]  it's clean. That means it's pure and rest secured. You're finding the tip of the spear in the Infowars.
[02:31:46.800 --> 02:31:51.840]  That's InfowarsLife.com and vitamin mineral fusion. Take action now before we sell out.
[02:31:51.840 --> 02:31:58.720]  It's been sold out for months and now it's back. It's mycozx plus lower price, more ingredients
[02:31:58.720 --> 02:32:04.320]  because we scaled up signed to your contract with an even bigger organic manufacturer and
[02:32:04.320 --> 02:32:11.920]  producer. Scalability but now we're able to go at 50% off to $27 instead of $39, 50% off because
[02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:16.800]  there's a lot of product and a lot of ingredient mycozx. Now it's the other side of the equation.
[02:32:16.800 --> 02:32:20.720]  Everybody thinks about probiotics and how great they are for your gut because you have toxins in
[02:32:20.720 --> 02:32:25.120]  the environment, pesticides, herbicides, but more importantly than bad bacteria, the probiotics
[02:32:25.120 --> 02:32:32.800]  help this place. Yeast mold creates slime walls and once the candida and the yeast and the mold
[02:32:32.800 --> 02:32:37.120]  and all that get in there it causes all sorts of psoriasis. Well this has got a bunch of concentrated
[02:32:37.120 --> 02:32:43.280]  herbs in it and compounds known to destroy that slime wall. Don't wait to start detoxifying your
[02:32:43.280 --> 02:32:49.840]  body until it's too late. Pick up a bottle of the new and improved mycozx plus now from the Infowars
[02:32:49.840 --> 02:32:51.840]  store.
[02:32:51.840 --> 02:33:17.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:21.840 --> 02:33:36.320]  Depeche Mode. Incredible band. Love them.
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:44.320]  See them at concert three times. Horribly politically dumb. The song, John the Revelator,
[02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:51.520]  if you read the lyrics says that Christians stole their faith from the Jews and you could argue
[02:33:51.520 --> 02:34:08.000]  that and then stole it from the Muslims. Crank it up. Here, I see it right here.
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:13.200]  What did John the Revelator say? You know, people think PK Dick wrote stuff in the 70s and 80s that
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:16.800]  came true. They're like, wow, this guy's a visionary. John the Revelator
[02:34:16.800 --> 02:34:24.240]  had a, what, three, four day hallucination and envisioned everything that now has happened.
[02:34:24.240 --> 02:34:27.760]  Mark of the Beast, world government, giant pillars of fire explosions,
[02:34:28.640 --> 02:34:31.520]  describes jets, helicopters, computers, robots.
[02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:41.360]  I mean, a book of lies. How about an incredibly amazing hallucination
[02:34:41.360 --> 02:34:46.080]  that, that became the blueprint of what happened regardless of how you look at it.
[02:34:57.840 --> 02:35:07.040]  That's bizarre. He stole it from the Muslims. Oh yeah, they didn't exist for 600 years.
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:14.560]  That's a fact to Pesh mode and that's what I mean about the left. Everything they say is BS
[02:35:15.280 --> 02:35:21.120]  and I'm sick of it. They call us fake news. No, we're the opposite of fake news
[02:35:24.720 --> 02:35:25.360]  and they know it.
[02:35:29.600 --> 02:35:35.200]  You imagine me in a jury, let's say David Hoggs sued me for comparing the youth march to Hitler.
[02:35:35.200 --> 02:35:38.160]  He's a public figure. It's thrown out on summary judgment. But imagine,
[02:35:42.000 --> 02:35:45.440]  imagine, I think they still might do it though, because they just get to put whatever they want
[02:35:45.440 --> 02:35:50.320]  in the suit and it's protected defamation in a suit. And so they just put it out. They're like,
[02:35:50.320 --> 02:35:56.160]  Jones has been sued by the surviving children because he said no one died. That's what they do.
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:02.400]  Hell, that's in the suit Georgetown filed. I'm like saying Hogg will sue me. It basically is the same
[02:36:02.400 --> 02:36:10.080]  group. In between when he's trying to get Lord Ingram off the air, the first of him it took.
[02:36:11.440 --> 02:36:14.800]  By the way, has my son tweeted yet? He wanted to come to work today. He had this idea of a video
[02:36:14.800 --> 02:36:20.000]  he was going to shoot and I just don't know. He's off in there and doing it on his own. I'm sure
[02:36:20.000 --> 02:36:24.320]  it'll be great. My God, I think he put out there that was a better one I do. That's why they're
[02:36:24.320 --> 02:36:30.400]  really upset right now. Soros's son can hardly talk. It's like, I'm really proud of Rex. But you know
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:35.200]  what? He's a man now and I had to talk with him last night about this because he wants I tried to
[02:36:35.200 --> 02:36:40.320]  talk him out of doing this. But I said once he made the decision that he wants to fight the globalist
[02:36:40.320 --> 02:36:44.800]  for real and he's really a man now. He's always wanted to do this. He was reading like adult
[02:36:44.800 --> 02:36:51.360]  history books when he was like 10. He understood and we had to talk last night about this and about
[02:36:51.360 --> 02:37:01.040]  how this is serious and that he wants to go down this road. Another gladiator in the fight for
[02:37:01.040 --> 02:37:08.000]  liberty just came out on the field, ladies and gentlemen. I can feel it. In newspapers all over
[02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:12.800]  you name it, the enemy is upset right now. They don't like it. Let me tell you something. My son
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:21.440]  at 15 walked in there. A few notes I gave him, a few ideas I had. 80% was him. And then he even
[02:37:21.440 --> 02:37:28.960]  did the basic edit and Rob do fixed a few things. I mean, that is incredible. That is amazing.
[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:37.280]  US senators can't talk like he can at 15. But the truth and the spirit and those eyes, the will,
[02:37:37.280 --> 02:37:44.000]  because he knows what he's pushing up against. I tell you, powerful Jedi.
[02:37:47.040 --> 02:37:53.600]  A new apprentice, younger and more powerful in the face of the globalist. Thank God.
[02:37:54.400 --> 02:37:58.960]  Man, God gave me a son right out of the gates. Boom. That's my whole life's like that.
[02:37:58.960 --> 02:38:04.320]  So blessed. I just thank God. I'm just on my knees constantly in my spirit. It's so miraculous.
[02:38:04.320 --> 02:38:09.760]  It's so good. I am such a wicked person. And to be given all these blessings and to be
[02:38:10.400 --> 02:38:16.400]  transcended and to be purified and to be sanctified minute by minute by the blood of Jesus is amazing.
[02:38:17.680 --> 02:38:24.960]  It's incredible that the, you know, these attacks are just elevating our discernment,
[02:38:24.960 --> 02:38:30.640]  our connections, our will. And as the globalists throw everything they've got at us,
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:35.040]  I know why Trump's high as a kite and leather as well. It just, Trump says, I've changed. I've
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:39.360]  changed. I wasn't bad before, but now I love Jesus. I understand. And people that know him,
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:43.200]  that's why they're really freaked out in the White House because it's like Trump is now like
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:47.600]  the Holy Ghost is with Trump. And of course, he's the president of the United States,
[02:38:47.600 --> 02:38:51.760]  put the globalist after him, trying to turn things around. I mean, this is epic.
[02:38:53.280 --> 02:38:58.640]  This is incredible. And I've got all this news to get to. I just have it because it's just such
[02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:08.800]  an amazing time to be alive. And I'm so proud of my son and I'm so proud of my daughters.
[02:39:09.440 --> 02:39:13.440]  I'm so proud of my wife and I'm so proud of this crew that puts up with all my crap
[02:39:14.080 --> 02:39:17.520]  and everybody else. I just, and the listeners, you're just so incredible
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:22.400]  because you're not just listeners. You're active. You are the blood of this country
[02:39:23.200 --> 02:39:28.320]  and the blood of the world. You are the energy. You are the force. You're the mind. You're the
[02:39:28.320 --> 02:39:34.320]  soul. You're the body. You're the will. You're the wind. You're the rain. You're the storm. You're
[02:39:34.320 --> 02:39:38.640]  the sun. You're the moon. You're the trees, the clouds, everything that ever was. We're just here.
[02:39:38.640 --> 02:39:44.720]  We're conscious. And then you look at the people that serve the globalists. They are so broken
[02:39:44.720 --> 02:39:50.560]  and so twisted and so evil. And we want to feel sorry for them because you have to understand
[02:39:50.560 --> 02:40:00.240]  they don't feel sorry for you. They want to destroy you, period. I mean, Hillary looks like
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:04.960]  someone out of a horror movie. And I'm not just because she's old. I look at old people that
[02:40:04.960 --> 02:40:09.280]  have a soul that shines through like a light through, you know, window pane or stained glass.
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:13.520]  The person has a beautiful soul as they get older, like an old gnarled tree. There's something so
[02:40:13.520 --> 02:40:18.480]  beautiful about it. But what evil people as they get old, all that's there is that demon
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:28.400]  shining out, grasping, arrogant, twisted, imbred, mentally ill. Hillary's dad was a Chicago gangster,
[02:40:29.280 --> 02:40:33.920]  an enforcer. I mean, she's just a genetic whack job.
[02:40:37.200 --> 02:40:43.440]  And you look at her and you just say, boy, I don't want to be separated from God.
[02:40:43.440 --> 02:40:48.240]  I mean, she looks like Emperor Palpatine without the makeup.
[02:40:56.240 --> 02:41:03.280]  And she's so sick mentally, but also physically, she has to mount incredible will
[02:41:03.280 --> 02:41:16.080]  to even go out and give an hour long speech. All that will for what, lady?
[02:41:19.520 --> 02:41:20.880]  It's all about you, isn't it? All right.
[02:41:22.480 --> 02:41:25.440]  Who's hosting the fourth hour? I've got so many clips that are so critical.
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:30.800]  And Joe Glibert's coming up and I've done 30 seconds of plugging in two hours today and
[02:41:30.800 --> 02:41:34.160]  they're like explaining, we will go bankrupt if I keep doing this. Hey, here's the deal,
[02:41:34.160 --> 02:41:38.480]  we got the best products out there, really good prices and everything you need. And then
[02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:43.840]  Patriot apparel and books and films and bodies, ultimate timber formulas back in 25% off and
[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:48.640]  about to end the special on brain force and the real red pill challenge. You get them both separately,
[02:41:48.640 --> 02:41:53.040]  50% off or together, 50% off, but together you get free shipping as well in four store.com and
[02:41:53.040 --> 02:41:58.240]  four is live.com or triple A, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine. And it is how you find
[02:41:58.240 --> 02:42:03.360]  the operation. But what's even cooler is to get a t-shirt and all the great folks you'll meet,
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:07.520]  all the people you'll meet that are awake and what's going on and every order gets a bunch of
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:12.240]  bumper stickers dumped in there. And we have the new shirt of the month. When tourney becomes law,
[02:42:13.200 --> 02:42:20.080]  t-shirt, it's the 3% really liked that shirt. So I got that 3% shirt and you sign up and get it.
[02:42:20.080 --> 02:42:23.840]  You get 25% off or you can buy the shirt just each month. They're all limited edition is the
[02:42:23.840 --> 02:42:28.080]  point. And so all of you out there thinking about us and standing with us, you're what
[02:42:28.080 --> 02:42:32.560]  empowers this whole thing and puts the wind in our sails. And you've got the commitment from me
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:38.080]  that you can tell we're never backing down. We're never giving up. My body will break,
[02:42:38.080 --> 02:42:43.760]  my will might break, but my spirit will never break. And we will make it through this. And
[02:42:43.760 --> 02:42:48.160]  the globalist will be destroyed. They already know that's why they want to take us with them.
[02:42:48.160 --> 02:42:53.680]  They already know they chose this wrong side. We've taken thousands of years of known research
[02:42:53.680 --> 02:42:59.200]  and put it together with our own four years of seeking and testing to find the very best systems
[02:42:59.200 --> 02:43:04.000]  that God gave us through Mother Nature to detoxify the body. That's why I'm introducing Z-Shield.
[02:43:04.000 --> 02:43:10.400]  Toxic metal and chemical defense support. It's made in the USA. It's filled with known compounds
[02:43:10.400 --> 02:43:15.120]  from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying the body and it supports the infomer.
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:20.880]  It is a classical 360 win. This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year.
[02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:25.920]  And now we believe we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as
[02:43:25.920 --> 02:43:29.760]  you can possibly get. You owe it to yourself. You owe it to your family. And you owe it to
[02:43:29.760 --> 02:43:34.880]  the future of this country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as
[02:43:34.880 --> 02:43:41.040]  focused as you can be. Because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires
[02:43:41.040 --> 02:43:45.040]  the next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be. Thanks to your support and your
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:49.360]  prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with Z-Shield
[02:43:49.360 --> 02:43:54.080]  and infowarslife.com. We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen. And I make it
[02:43:54.080 --> 02:43:59.120]  really easy. We went out and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy
[02:43:59.120 --> 02:44:04.880]  for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it. And we created a stronger formula
[02:44:04.880 --> 02:44:08.320]  than some of the best-selling formulas out there. It's very simple. We went out and like,
[02:44:08.320 --> 02:44:11.600]  look, what is the top? What is the best? We'll just put even more product in. We'll make it
[02:44:11.600 --> 02:44:17.040]  better. Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for 60 bucks. We put $10 in it
[02:44:17.040 --> 02:44:22.720]  and sell it for 30 bucks. It's $19.95 right now. So you get an incredible top-of-the-line
[02:44:22.720 --> 02:44:28.880]  new tropic for $19.95. Believe me, when we're selling it for $35 on average, we need that $15,
[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:33.360]  $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the global threat of it. But I'm doing this
[02:44:33.360 --> 02:44:38.240]  because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks. I want to sell it all out before the big supply
[02:44:38.240 --> 02:44:42.880]  comes in. And I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and find out why. It's got
[02:44:42.880 --> 02:44:50.320]  6,000 plus five-star reviews. It's amazing. InfoWarsStore.com, InfoWarsLive.com, or AAA-2533139.
[02:44:52.160 --> 02:44:57.920]  InfoWarsLive BrainForce Plus is our number one selling product by Leaps and Bounds. And for a
[02:44:57.920 --> 02:45:02.320]  good reason. Going back about five years ago, we did research on what top-selling new tropics were,
[02:45:02.320 --> 02:45:07.120]  what were most popular, what were best, what people liked. And we made it even stronger. Then
[02:45:07.120 --> 02:45:13.600]  we cut the price because leading competitors have five to seven times markup. We only have 150%.
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:21.360]  Then it helps funder operation. Well, now it's 50% off. That means we've got a 25% markup.
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:27.600]  And we've got it paired with the real red pill that takes about seven days to kick in. BrainForce
[02:45:27.600 --> 02:45:33.120]  takes about 30 minutes. But the two go together. It's the mind and body challenge. They're both
[02:45:33.120 --> 02:45:41.760]  50% off individually or together they're 50% off and free shipping with the combo at InfoWarsLive.com.
[02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:46.960]  But it's got to end in a couple days because both of these best sellers are about to sell out.
[02:45:46.960 --> 02:45:53.200]  InfoWarsLive.com to get your BrainForce Plus and real red pill today. You know, if I tried to sit
[02:45:53.200 --> 02:45:59.520]  here and tell you about the 60 plus products, we have an InfoWarsLive. It takes hours. Michael ZX Plus
[02:45:59.520 --> 02:46:04.320]  now has a lower price. It's stronger. It's the other equation in probiotics. It knocks out the
[02:46:04.320 --> 02:46:11.120]  yeast, the mold, the candida. It's back in stock. The real red pill, it's been sold out for months.
[02:46:11.120 --> 02:46:14.960]  It's got the preglonone. That's the precursor to all the natural hormones in your body.
[02:46:14.960 --> 02:46:19.200]  Then it's got all the minerals and the vitamins, the amino acids. So you can upload it. And our
[02:46:19.200 --> 02:46:25.120]  latest product that goes great with the super blue colloidal silver and iodine fortified toothpaste
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:31.120]  is super blue silver immune gargle. That's a spray you do. You can also swallow it. It's a supplement
[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:37.520]  with iodine, a super high quality silver and a lot more. Without you, we couldn't do it. So thank
[02:46:37.520 --> 02:46:43.200]  you all for remembering InfoWarsLive.com and remembering that it's not just you that's already
[02:46:43.200 --> 02:46:47.280]  awake, but it's other people that aren't awake. It's so essential to spread the word. Again,
[02:46:47.280 --> 02:46:50.160]  thank you so much for being part of the Second American Revolution.
[02:46:50.160 --> 02:46:57.440]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:47:11.360 --> 02:47:16.400]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:16.400 --> 02:47:24.720]  I don't want to say I dropped the ball today because I got distracted by a bunch of stuff
[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:27.280]  going on behind the scenes. Man, I should have got to all these clips.
[02:47:28.560 --> 02:47:34.240]  Jeez. Congressman FBI report says Andrew McCabe lied four times about media leaks under
[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:39.040]  oath. Of course, he's a criminal. Well, just because he looks like a kindle doesn't mean
[02:47:39.600 --> 02:47:42.480]  you know most of the real psychopaths actually look like kindles.
[02:47:42.480 --> 02:47:49.440]  But the people always get in the car with them. The women think, oh, he looks like he's a nice guy.
[02:47:51.440 --> 02:47:57.840]  That is a Clinton criminal. And this crap about, oh, you're putting the FBI down. The FBI letting
[02:47:57.840 --> 02:48:06.560]  people like that run it is the problem. You are absolutely destroying yourselves. It's amazing.
[02:48:07.520 --> 02:48:10.160]  All right, let me get into the clips I said I was in place. These are important.
[02:48:10.160 --> 02:48:14.720]  Here's this vice hit piece. I'm not going to hear the whole thing. It's 10 minutes long.
[02:48:14.720 --> 02:48:20.880]  It's on info wars.com. You want to see it? But they go horrible people are saying kids are actors
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:24.640]  and that no one really died. And then they show people that have that viewer saying it.
[02:48:24.640 --> 02:48:27.600]  And that's their right to do. That's their first amendment because the government's
[02:48:27.600 --> 02:48:32.160]  lied so much and that lied about babies and incubators against the Iraq war and girls that
[02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:36.400]  were kidnapped for the Panama invasion and that no one was kidnapped. And now, oh my God,
[02:48:36.400 --> 02:48:40.080]  two Russians got nerve gas. We don't have any proof the Russians did it, but let's have nuclear war
[02:48:40.080 --> 02:48:44.960]  because of it. I think the shootings happened. I think that stuff went on, but then they grabbed
[02:48:44.960 --> 02:48:50.320]  people that were Democrats in the acting department and for PR to put out the anti-gun message.
[02:48:50.320 --> 02:48:55.040]  That's admitted now. Okay, you're anti-gun. That's your right. Okay, you got with political
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:01.120]  organizations. They're using you. That's a fact. But I don't want to retreat from this thing of like,
[02:49:01.120 --> 02:49:07.280]  well, I didn't say they're crisis actors, but other people have that right. But they mixed
[02:49:07.280 --> 02:49:12.640]  me in with all them in a 10 minute report where you're already emotional and mad and pour a little
[02:49:12.640 --> 02:49:17.520]  hoglet and everything. And then, oh, there's that Jones. And it's just all part of the
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:24.240]  newspaper articles every hour. I can't even keep track of it. Jones says the kids didn't die banning.
[02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:28.640]  You know, when are we going to get rid of this free speech thing? This is the end of free speech.
[02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:36.000]  We're the test case. And now the left's running around saying Jones is using a son. He's a child.
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:39.360]  He shouldn't be allowed on air. So you can have everybody else can be on air and all these other
[02:49:39.360 --> 02:49:43.280]  students can be on air with their anti-gun. But now because you can't censor my son off air,
[02:49:44.000 --> 02:49:48.800]  the new thing is why Jones is telling him what to say. Actually, well, somebody run over there.
[02:49:49.360 --> 02:49:53.120]  We got here at like, you know, 10 o'clock, he's been over there. Did they put out the tweets
[02:49:53.120 --> 02:49:56.320]  from Rex? I don't know. He wanted to challenge hog on my Twitter. He wanted his own Twitter.
[02:49:56.320 --> 02:50:00.080]  And I said, I don't know yet. Use mine. And it's all my son doing it. I don't even know what he's
[02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:06.240]  done. So somebody find out or go to real Alex Jones. Oh, it's on screen. Thank you. So he has
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:11.520]  done it. So there you go. You know, he's a man. He's 15. But just like the Democrats can say,
[02:50:11.520 --> 02:50:16.160]  we're all Hitler and do jokes where we're Hitler and all this, we do it. We get banned. Oh, well,
[02:50:16.160 --> 02:50:22.000]  my son, he shouldn't be allowed to be online either. Well, he's just a baby at 15 says that
[02:50:22.000 --> 02:50:25.520]  David Hogg, you were a public figure who has viciously attacked my father and others for
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:29.920]  nothing more than criticizing you. You and your CNN buddies are currently trying to take our YouTube
[02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:34.880]  channel down. Why are you so against free speech? That's good. And I did see do about an hour ago.
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:39.440]  And I said, Hey, if Rex is tweeting, make get into Laura Ingram and how hog wants him banned,
[02:50:39.440 --> 02:50:42.640]  that was my little two cents. And he goes, Oh, we're already on it. He already knows about that.
[02:50:42.640 --> 02:50:48.640]  So see, Rex is already, it isn't like he's saying what I say, he's already synced. He already gets
[02:50:48.640 --> 02:50:53.760]  it. It's like, well, now hog says, get rid of Laura Ingram. She's like, okay, in the, it was
[02:50:53.760 --> 02:50:58.880]  Easter weeks up. Okay, you said you can't get into college. I said, Oh, where are you whining
[02:50:58.880 --> 02:51:03.120]  about it? Okay, I apologize. The interest is being nice. He's like, I want your job.
[02:51:04.880 --> 02:51:07.840]  Well, my God, if hog wants your job, you better tell him he wants her
[02:51:09.200 --> 02:51:12.640]  sent to Mars, we better do it. And he was going to send some other tweets out. Is that the only one?
[02:51:15.120 --> 02:51:16.880]  No, no, but he was going to send out multiple tweets.
[02:51:18.000 --> 02:51:20.960]  There was a whole, there was a whole, I was there with him this morning in the car. He was like
[02:51:20.960 --> 02:51:24.000]  writing the tweets he wanted to send. Cause I'm like, let me check what you're going to say.
[02:51:24.000 --> 02:51:28.720]  And I'm like, no, don't call him a name. I mean, my two cents was you'll be a little nicer.
[02:51:29.760 --> 02:51:32.560]  So I guess that's he didn't send out the other tweets he was going to send. Okay, whatever.
[02:51:33.680 --> 02:51:37.280]  So there you go. That's how I'm directing him. I'm not directing him. I just said, you know,
[02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:42.160]  my one critique of his video was don't say crawl back under your rock, even though he's calling
[02:51:42.160 --> 02:51:47.680]  me names and all that. I said, don't go to his level. But you can see, I didn't, I didn't,
[02:51:47.680 --> 02:51:52.640]  I didn't even pre-look at it. They just put it out. So that's how much I'm trusting my son right
[02:51:52.640 --> 02:51:58.240]  now. I mean, I'm giving him two cents, but then I'm walking away to see if he executes. And he is.
[02:52:00.320 --> 02:52:03.440]  So there's a new video. Let's hear that the next five minutes. We download the new Twitter video
[02:52:03.440 --> 02:52:07.040]  he put out. I guess he put a video out too. So we'll find out about that. Okay. So I'm back on
[02:52:07.040 --> 02:52:12.640]  the hog thing. Here he is on vice, just part of the tirage. And then it cuts into them misrepresenting
[02:52:12.640 --> 02:52:17.920]  what I say. Here it is. We've had to learn to deal with these sick f***ers that are saying this stuff
[02:52:18.640 --> 02:52:22.960]  that are out there claiming that we're not real people, claiming that we're actors.
[02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:25.040]  We don't get f***ed what you say.
[02:52:26.640 --> 02:52:34.160]  Television is the David Hogg channel now. He's on everywhere. And I know scripted PR when I hear
[02:52:34.160 --> 02:52:38.720]  it. One of them went into a bathroom in the same, I believe in the same hallway as the shooter.
[02:52:38.720 --> 02:52:44.400]  One of them went into the same bathroom, I believe, as the hallway shooter.
[02:52:45.040 --> 02:52:50.320]  That's called a sound bite. And I was resaying my sound bites to sound as eloquent as possible.
[02:52:50.320 --> 02:52:55.600]  I wasn't reciting my lines. I was reciting my heart. I mean, it is incredible, though,
[02:52:55.600 --> 02:53:00.880]  to watch fake news in action. I mean, this, this is how you murder the truth. And I don't know if
[02:53:00.880 --> 02:53:06.480]  David Hogg understands this. He probably does it. I tweeted the lovely man that is Alex Jones.
[02:53:06.480 --> 02:53:10.400]  I wanted to come on and actually debate him. But then I realized some of the stuff that he was
[02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:14.160]  saying, which was the exact same stuff that he said about the Sandy Hook survivors,
[02:53:14.800 --> 02:53:20.320]  saying that they were actors. Then we see footage of one of the reported fathers of the victims,
[02:53:20.320 --> 02:53:26.640]  Robbie Parker, doing classic acting training where he's laughing and joking. And they say,
[02:53:26.640 --> 02:53:34.640]  hey, we're live. And he goes, oh, maybe that's real. I'm sure it is. He's doing that exact same
[02:53:34.640 --> 02:53:38.640]  stuff. And knowing that you had done that before, I wasn't going to give him time and day.
[02:53:38.640 --> 02:53:42.080]  We didn't say you were a crisis actor and believe this happened. We just pointed out that you're
[02:53:42.080 --> 02:53:46.080]  an admitted actor and journalism student and said that you're anti-gun and that you're being fed
[02:53:46.080 --> 02:53:51.360]  talking points. Alex Jones was probably the first one that created the narrative of Sandy Hook
[02:53:51.360 --> 02:54:08.880]  victim dies again. I'll stop right there. And no, I didn't. And they had a picture of children
[02:54:08.880 --> 02:54:15.440]  killed at Sandy Hook in Pakistan at a bombing. And I just said, the web was reporting on it.
[02:54:15.440 --> 02:54:20.000]  I said, you know, that's probably just a PR group that's just seizing on the bombing and
[02:54:20.000 --> 02:54:24.160]  just printed up some pictures. And I'm sure the Islamic bombing really happened. Just like
[02:54:25.280 --> 02:54:29.520]  they're trying to misrepresent what I say now. And like, oh my God, Alex is being mean to the
[02:54:29.520 --> 02:54:35.680]  people. These are the folks telling you that I said no one died at Parkland. They don't have a video
[02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:42.800]  of it because I didn't say it. But there's hog going along with the John Podesta scripted stuff
[02:54:42.800 --> 02:54:47.440]  Hillary put out that Jones is saying the exact same thing about me that he said about that.
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:52.640]  No, I didn't say that about them. I didn't say that about you and you know it. And that's why
[02:54:52.640 --> 02:54:56.880]  the clips they have are not even me saying that. But they tell you I said one thing and
[02:54:56.880 --> 02:55:02.720]  then have to show you something completely different. I don't even know what level of
[02:55:02.720 --> 02:55:10.160]  propaganda this is by vice. But David Hogg is in a man's world. David Hogg is public. David Hogg
[02:55:10.160 --> 02:55:14.880]  is doing all this now separately. Again, you can't compare this to Hitler or they ban your video.
[02:55:14.880 --> 02:55:20.560]  But the left calls everyone Hitler and everyone racist but them. It's crazy how they operate,
[02:55:20.560 --> 02:55:27.200]  how entitled they are. You know, I've got some of these clips here. This is Hillary Clinton
[02:55:27.760 --> 02:55:37.680]  moderator at Rutgers Invokes Nazism while talking about America and Hillary. And then Hillary goes,
[02:55:37.680 --> 02:55:42.560]  oh yeah, we don't want Trump attacking the press. When Trump fights back, that's free speech.
[02:55:42.560 --> 02:55:45.920]  It's the left controlling the press. It's the left calling for us to be banned.
[02:55:45.920 --> 02:55:51.520]  It's the left calling for Trump to be off Twitter. You're the censors publicly. You think we're that
[02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:58.000]  dumb in this mind control? Where you're censoring us. You're attacking us. You're calling for this.
[02:55:58.000 --> 02:56:02.400]  You're doing it all over the world. And then you say we are. And then she has this condescending
[02:56:02.400 --> 02:56:09.280]  look like attacks on the press. And you look at the crowd of women. And it's like a weird
[02:56:09.280 --> 02:56:14.880]  whack job cult of chip on their shoulder. People that just want power and want to run stuff,
[02:56:14.880 --> 02:56:22.160]  but they can't run their own lives. Here it is. As someone who grew up in Vienna and barely escaped
[02:56:22.160 --> 02:56:29.120]  the Holocaust, my mother would say from time to time that it could happen here. And.
[02:56:29.120 --> 02:56:39.520]  And hit pause. Back it up again. George Soros. In the WikiLeaks wants to overthrow Israel.
[02:56:39.520 --> 02:56:45.360]  Look it up. Jerusalem Post. George Soros worked for the Nazis and was proud of it and said best
[02:56:45.360 --> 02:56:51.280]  time of his life he'd do it again. 50 minutes. And then you've got a Jewish lady talking about her
[02:56:51.280 --> 02:56:57.840]  family. When George Soros is the main funder of Hillary, it's just too rich, man.
[02:56:57.840 --> 02:57:05.600]  God almighty. Just go back to her. Just go ahead. As someone who grew up in Vienna and
[02:57:05.600 --> 02:57:12.400]  barely escaped the Holocaust, my mother would say from time to time that it could happen here.
[02:57:13.360 --> 02:57:21.760]  And I was, I would be very dismissive of that. I would dismiss it and I'd dismiss her comments
[02:57:21.760 --> 02:57:24.960]  and her fears as implausible. By the way, hit pause. We're going to come back and break
[02:57:24.960 --> 02:57:28.560]  pause. We should take this video and put it with Antifa hitting people in the head. The
[02:57:28.560 --> 02:57:32.480]  Democrats calling for killing people and, you know, plays that call for killing conservatives.
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:36.800]  You know, the, the, the, the assassination of Katie Hopkins. I mean, we should just
[02:57:36.800 --> 02:57:40.320]  narrate it to that. Hashtag hunt Republicans. All of it.
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:47.040]  Let's go to debit and Florida debit and Florida. You're on the air.
[02:57:47.920 --> 02:57:54.000]  Great. Hey, thank you so much. Listen, I have bought your product and I gotta say they're amazing.

[02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:13.440]  I really liked the vitamin mineral fusion to be honest. That's amazing. That's incredible. I drank
[02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:18.000]  it in the morning and I swear to you, I felt incredible. Like I haven't felt sweet. My morning

[02:59:45.920 --> 02:59:48.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:51.040 --> 02:59:55.120]  Well, I was thumbing from Montgomery. I had my guitar on my back.
[02:59:56.960 --> 03:00:00.640]  When a stranger stopped beside me in an antique Cadillac.
[03:00:00.640 --> 03:00:09.920]  He was dressed like 1950, half drunk and hollow eyed. He said it's a long walk to Nashville.
[03:00:09.920 --> 03:00:16.400]  Would you like to ride, son? Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones,
[03:00:16.400 --> 03:00:19.920]  coming to you live from the front lines of the info war.
[03:00:19.920 --> 03:00:26.960]  I sat down in the front seat and turned on the radio and them sad old songs coming out of them
[03:00:26.960 --> 03:00:34.000]  speakers was solid country gold. Then I noticed a stranger was ghost white tear when he asked me
[03:00:34.000 --> 03:00:42.000]  for a light. And I knew there was something strange about this ride. He said, he said,
[03:00:42.000 --> 03:00:50.080]  can you make folks cry when you play a song? Have you paid your dues? Can you mow the
[03:00:50.080 --> 03:00:56.880]  can you bend them guitar strings? Ladies and gentlemen, the Daily Mail and many others have written about Rex
[03:00:58.080 --> 03:01:04.240]  going on air and challenging David Hogg to a debate. Well, my son came to me.
[03:01:05.760 --> 03:01:10.320]  I guess it was Wednesday night, Tuesday night, and he just said, man, this hog guy, I'm sick of this.
[03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:14.240]  He was like, look at this article. They're saying that you
[03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:19.760]  challenged Hogg to a debate and bullied him, but he challenged you. He said, dad, I want to debate
[03:01:19.760 --> 03:01:23.280]  that guy. I said, Rex, well, that'll be a pretty big story. If you do that, you can get some good
[03:01:23.280 --> 03:01:27.360]  points out about the Second Amendment. I said, what do you want to do? He kind of gave me his idea.
[03:01:28.080 --> 03:01:34.320]  And I said, write it down next morning. I got up at six a.m. He got up about six a.m. He was going
[03:01:34.320 --> 03:01:42.000]  to jujitsu before school, grabbed an Uber and he gave me his list. I said, yeah. And then I guess
[03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:46.960]  it was the next day then that he came out for school. But the point is, is that
[03:01:46.960 --> 03:01:53.680]  that all these publications are coming out saying in the same article, they talk about Hogg,
[03:01:53.680 --> 03:02:02.640]  that I have thrust my son into politics that I am this terrible father that has done this.
[03:02:03.200 --> 03:02:08.240]  Alex Jones turns to his 15-year-old son to defend him from bullying by David Hogg.
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:12.800]  Yeah, the bullying's tongue in cheek. David Hogg called me a piece of, you know what,
[03:02:12.800 --> 03:02:16.880]  and said I'm a scammer and all this other stuff, and tried to get my YouTube channel shut down.
[03:02:16.880 --> 03:02:21.440]  That's a violation of the First Amendment. But we just point out he's the one by their yardstick
[03:02:21.440 --> 03:02:26.000]  bullying. He wants to be able to jump out, oh, I'm a victim. Oh, I'm a child. Oh, but, you know,
[03:02:26.000 --> 03:02:32.960]  you're all shaking in your boots and F you. So I'm going to read over some of this when we come
[03:02:32.960 --> 03:02:38.560]  back. But this is just look at the size of this article. It's like how many pages long? I mean,
[03:02:38.560 --> 03:02:43.600]  I just read like five pages during the break. 34 pages long.
[03:02:51.440 --> 03:02:56.800]  And then there's like some implication. I'm violating a court order having my son on air.
[03:02:59.120 --> 03:03:02.400]  And I'm already at the lawyers in contact with YouTube. So I'll just go ahead and get into this
[03:03:02.400 --> 03:03:07.680]  now. That's what's going on with my ex-wife is there'll be a gag or the judge lifts when the
[03:03:07.680 --> 03:03:12.080]  trial was over. But then she'll take a thing and send it to YouTube saying that that just happened.
[03:03:12.080 --> 03:03:15.840]  Look, look, there's a gag order talking about the court case. I don't talk about it. My ex-wife
[03:03:15.840 --> 03:03:20.560]  talks about it constantly. But she takes one video I do with my lawyer explaining, no, I
[03:03:20.560 --> 03:03:26.080]  didn't lose. It's 50-50. And here's my lawyer. So there's a gag order yet that was lifted after
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:32.800]  the trial. And to be the same thing here, she got an injunction not once, but twice when Rex was
[03:03:32.800 --> 03:03:38.400]  13 and 14 to not be on air, which the lawyers don't think is constitutional, but I didn't
[03:03:38.400 --> 03:03:43.040]  buck it. It makes you want to be on air even more. And now the injunction has been up for almost
[03:03:44.240 --> 03:03:48.160]  nine months. And I said, okay, you want to go on? And I even called the lawyers. They said, no,
[03:03:48.160 --> 03:03:52.320]  there's no, there's no injunction. It's open. But then I realized, because that's already being said,
[03:03:52.320 --> 03:03:59.920]  Jones violated an injunction and put his son on YouTube. Van Alex Jones immediately. And like
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:06.080]  the left, they never think another step. People are going to go, wait a minute. His son is six foot
[03:04:06.080 --> 03:04:13.040]  one already has arms as big around as mine. And I'm like a gorilla. Because some of his
[03:04:13.040 --> 03:04:22.560]  grandfathers were big, my dad's little. And he got, he's got a mustache. He grew a mustache in three
[03:04:22.560 --> 03:04:29.360]  days. And all these leftists get to have their kids all over the world. But I can't see because
[03:04:29.360 --> 03:04:34.960]  I'm an American. I'm a conservative. I'm a libertarian. And we don't have speech.
[03:04:37.840 --> 03:04:43.120]  It's a long hard ride, but it's worth it, isn't it? That's right. Going to warn you. It's a long
[03:04:43.120 --> 03:04:53.120]  hard ride. We'll be back. Stay with us. Nourish a probiotic friendly environment in your gut

[03:06:06.400 --> 03:06:13.840]  Well, the left is apoplectic, they're panicking. You can hear the bugle call the calories here,
[03:06:13.840 --> 03:06:20.640]  Rex Jones. And they're like, I was reading this Austin American statesman 30-something page article
[03:06:20.640 --> 03:06:23.920]  and I got to admit Till Love is thorough, but he kind of goes back and forth. He says something
[03:06:23.920 --> 03:06:28.320]  really isn't accurate. He says something that is accurate, but I guess that's how he gets away
[03:06:28.320 --> 03:06:33.040]  with writing the statesman. I think secretly he's a listener or something, but he's got it down here
[03:06:33.040 --> 03:06:38.720]  where he talks about David Hogg being incredibly off-putting. I just had it and I can't find it.
[03:06:40.720 --> 03:06:44.720]  Well, I will admit that I find Hogg's arrogance off-putting and unsettling.
[03:06:45.920 --> 03:06:50.560]  Yeah, he can get a career in Hollywood acting like a supervillain. I mean, there's a certain
[03:06:50.560 --> 03:06:55.920]  little gleam in the eye and he's like, and they're panicking and they're afraid of debaters and we're
[03:06:55.920 --> 03:07:03.280]  got them shaking and they're like, oh, yes, they would give us an inch. We take it a mile, little Mermaid,
[03:07:03.280 --> 03:07:10.000]  sign the contract. He's like, I have you now. We want your guys rule, communist take on it.
[03:07:14.480 --> 03:07:22.240]  I love it. I mean, who do you think the global is going to groom and get all polished up for this?
[03:07:22.240 --> 03:07:34.400]  They got to be just as bottom feeder as they are. So kill love has to admit that Hogglet comes off
[03:07:34.400 --> 03:07:40.720]  like a power tripping megalomaniac. I mean, let me tell you something. When you're clicking your
[03:07:40.720 --> 03:07:49.840]  heels and doing fashion salutes on national television, you got a problem. You know, put me away,
[03:07:49.840 --> 03:07:54.640]  put me out in the pasture. If I ever want to get up from a crowd and click my heels, turn sideways
[03:07:54.640 --> 03:08:04.080]  in a military salute and then do a fashion salute. Just the optics, you only do that when you are a
[03:08:04.080 --> 03:08:14.880]  control freak maniac. And the left cuts in Trump and me with Hitler everywhere. But if we do it,
[03:08:14.880 --> 03:08:22.960]  we're the worst people in the world that'd be banned because Hogg is God. Hogg is God. Hogg is
[03:08:22.960 --> 03:08:32.960]  God. Hogg is God. Hog, Hog, Hog. We love Hogg. King Hogg. Lord Hogg. Master Hogg. King Hogg. Lord Hogg.
[03:08:37.600 --> 03:08:43.520]  And then you got Hillary up there financed by a 89-year-old famous Nazi collaborator who went
[03:08:43.520 --> 03:08:48.160]  on 60 Minutes and confessed to it and said, he wasn't sorry, and it was quote, the best time of his
[03:08:48.160 --> 03:08:53.920]  life. Even the Nazis at Nuremberg were like, we're very sorry, please. George Soros was like,
[03:08:55.840 --> 03:09:06.960]  I really enjoyed it. And I'm going to roll out Hillary in front of you to strut her stuff,
[03:09:06.960 --> 03:09:14.640]  bulk, the wave of evil behind her. And I'm going to complain about Hitler in America.
[03:09:20.240 --> 03:09:25.680]  And you look at the anti-Israel vitriol. And I used to be on the fence about Israel because it's
[03:09:25.680 --> 03:09:30.480]  just another country. Until I realized the left sacrament is hating Israel and working with the
[03:09:30.480 --> 03:09:35.120]  radical Islamists and they want to overthrow it and Soros documents came out. And then I watched
[03:09:35.120 --> 03:09:42.240]  the leftist Jews loving Soros. It's the craziest fruitcake level stuff I've ever seen and calling
[03:09:42.240 --> 03:09:49.520]  everyone a Nazi who isn't a Nazi. And then Arnold wears a death-said SS officer belt in Heavy Metal,
[03:09:49.520 --> 03:09:53.360]  the part they cut. This is in Rolling Stone. He said, I love Hitler. His dad was an SS officer.
[03:09:53.360 --> 03:09:57.280]  His brother was a product of an SS marriage. He was born after World War II. His brother
[03:09:57.280 --> 03:10:03.120]  that died in a car wreck. And I just know all this stuff. I mean, I've read the Rolling Stone
[03:10:03.120 --> 03:10:13.760]  interview. The 80L gives him an award. In Pumping Iron, that's why he bought the films they wouldn't
[03:10:13.760 --> 03:10:20.880]  release on the DVD. He would tell the black people they weren't human and then take
[03:10:23.120 --> 03:10:27.680]  their black girlfriend from them and have sex in front of everybody's inactive dominance
[03:10:27.680 --> 03:10:34.640]  and say, I'm Arnold Schwarzenegger and I am in the bestiality. That is, there's film of that.
[03:10:36.160 --> 03:10:41.920]  Of people talking about and Arnold's like, you bet I do. Black stars human. And the 80L is like,
[03:10:41.920 --> 03:10:47.120]  God almighty, can we get you an award right now? He's like, I wear that Hitler belt. I dress in
[03:10:47.120 --> 03:10:52.720]  SS uniforms and play Hitler records when you come to my home for dinner. I told Maria, you only wear
[03:10:52.720 --> 03:10:59.840]  dresses. Hell Hitler. But see the left lifestyle, that's a fetish thing with Hollywood and all those
[03:10:59.840 --> 03:11:04.640]  old guys like Nazi stuff. It's come out in the news like all these old Hollywood guys are just
[03:11:04.640 --> 03:11:08.560]  collecting it and loving it and they're like telling their black girlfriends, well, you can't
[03:11:08.560 --> 03:11:16.400]  have any black boy friends. I love that. Well, you're Jewish. And that's it. There's like a Hollywood
[03:11:16.400 --> 03:11:25.520]  Jewish Nazi cult. God, these people are evil. Jesus. It's devil worship. They like anything bad.
[03:11:25.520 --> 03:11:38.960]  Communism, Hitler, it doesn't matter. I want to be famous like Hitler or Jesus. I like Hitler. I
[03:11:38.960 --> 03:11:52.560]  admire him. And then I get to sit there and watch it. Rutgers, an old Jewish lady going,
[03:11:52.560 --> 03:11:57.440]  I'm afraid Hitler's going to get me. Sweetheart, Hitler already got your cupcake.
[03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:03.520]  You're sitting there with the most powerful known Nazi connection there is.
[03:12:03.520 --> 03:12:11.040]  That tentacle, just like, you know, the demon in it has a tentacle that uses the clown,
[03:12:12.080 --> 03:12:17.120]  tellerizes the tongue of the anglerfish. That's what they are. It's like a little,
[03:12:17.680 --> 03:12:23.360]  and so it's like a dying robot, but it's still, it's animated only by pure Luciferian energy.
[03:12:23.360 --> 03:12:31.520]  And you're sitting there next to Hitler's weapon. I mean, literally, direct control by the spirit
[03:12:31.520 --> 03:12:38.080]  of that. And you are next to a Satanist and you're afraid of Hitler when the Satanists are flipping
[03:12:38.080 --> 03:12:43.200]  out over Trump and he's backing Israel. You're an idiot. God almighty.
[03:12:48.640 --> 03:12:54.320]  Headline, Jones attacks daughter of Holocaust survivor for fighting Hitler.
[03:12:54.320 --> 03:13:01.760]  You're all idiots for following Hillary. She is manifest evil. Let's play the clip.
[03:13:01.760 --> 03:13:04.800]  I've been saying I played all day. Let's play here. Start over the beginning with the woman
[03:13:05.360 --> 03:13:09.440]  of scared of Hitler, scared of Trump, and then Hillary about how there's an attack on the press
[03:13:09.440 --> 03:13:15.600]  when she's the one doing it. Here it is. As someone who grew up in Vienna and barely escaped the
[03:13:15.600 --> 03:13:24.480]  Holocaust, my mother would say from time to time that it could happen here. And I was,
[03:13:25.600 --> 03:13:30.720]  I would be very dismissive of that. I would dismiss it and I'd dismiss her comments and
[03:13:30.720 --> 03:13:37.600]  her fears as implausible. I now find it shocking. I'm even about to ask this question, but I do
[03:13:37.600 --> 03:13:44.320]  want you to talk about what are your concerns about the stability of our democratic institutions
[03:13:44.320 --> 03:13:50.400]  and structures in these tumultuous moments and what for you is head pause again.
[03:13:51.040 --> 03:13:55.520]  Hillary announced two years ago the attack on the first amendment and called for us to be banned
[03:13:55.520 --> 03:14:03.040]  and called me dark heart. Got inverse that name. Go back to her of American democracy.
[03:14:04.400 --> 03:14:09.040]  Well, I am. I'm fundamentally optimistic and hopeful.
[03:14:09.040 --> 03:14:16.400]  But I don't think that optimism and hope is warranted unless we do what we're supposed to do
[03:14:16.400 --> 03:14:26.400]  as citizens. Which is me on the payroll of a Nazi collaborator. I worry about the degradation
[03:14:27.120 --> 03:14:34.000]  of institutions, the dismissing. That means they're criminal networks and values.
[03:14:34.000 --> 03:14:44.560]  Because she has the values. Oh, she just fine. She. Oh, we're in charge. It's like pretend
[03:14:44.560 --> 03:14:51.840]  princess land. We're in charge and everyone's bad that us and fantasy land. Yeah, let's go back to
[03:14:51.840 --> 03:14:59.680]  her together by trust. You can disagree with somebody. But at the end of the day, you have a
[03:14:59.680 --> 03:15:08.240]  common interest in how we make decisions. You have an awareness of the importance of facts
[03:15:08.240 --> 03:15:14.080]  and evidence on which to base those decisions. So they just say facts and evidence. They have
[03:15:14.080 --> 03:15:19.200]  these signs and awesome black lives matter. Science is real. It's like we own science.
[03:15:19.200 --> 03:15:24.880]  Science is real. And we're mad about it. Keep going. She said she goes and there's an attack
[03:15:24.880 --> 03:15:31.440]  on the press. Absolutely essential role of the press. And you protect that.
[03:15:32.640 --> 03:15:38.080]  But you're you're the ones destroying it. And you look at these women. I mean,
[03:15:38.080 --> 03:15:42.720]  look at these pseudo intellectuals. Go back to the video. Look at their slaves.
[03:15:43.360 --> 03:15:47.600]  They're not even bad people. They don't have 10 brain cells put together.

[03:17:44.000 --> 03:17:50.880]  have a safe, joyous and peaceful holiday season. We need to fund this operation,
[03:17:50.880 --> 03:17:54.880]  ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy. We went out and looked at what the top
[03:17:54.880 --> 03:18:00.640]  new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy, stamina, mental clarity, you name it. And
[03:18:00.640 --> 03:18:05.600]  we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling formulas out there. It's very simple.
[03:18:05.600 --> 03:18:09.360]  We went out and looked at what is the top, what is the best. We'll just put even more product in,
[03:18:09.360 --> 03:18:13.760]  we'll make it better. Leading competitors put $2 a product in it, sell it for $60,
[03:18:13.760 --> 03:18:20.720]  we put $10 in it and sell it for $30. It's $19.95 right now. So you get an incredible top of the
[03:18:20.720 --> 03:18:27.120]  line new tropic for $19.95. Believe me, we're selling it for $35 on average. We need that $15,
[03:18:27.120 --> 03:18:31.600]  $20 we make to fund this operation in the face of the global, the rest of it. But I'm doing this
[03:18:31.600 --> 03:18:36.400]  because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks. I want to shell it all out before the big supply
[03:18:36.400 --> 03:18:41.120]  comes in. And I want people that haven't tried BrainForce to try it and find out why. It's got
[03:18:41.120 --> 03:18:48.480]  6,000 plus five-star reviews. It's amazing. Infowarsstore.com, infowarslive.com or AAA 2533139.
[03:18:48.480 --> 03:18:54.160]  The reason Infowarslife has five-star ratings on major third-party sites is because I want
[03:18:54.160 --> 03:18:58.320]  products I'm going to use for my family. I take this, my family takes this, and then it funds
[03:18:58.320 --> 03:19:02.080]  the operation with the most hardcore, truthful information you're going to find anywhere. So
[03:19:02.080 --> 03:19:06.480]  what you find in our news is the same thing you find in our products at infowarslife.com.
[03:19:06.480 --> 03:19:12.400]  If I ever forget to take them, like, I have a noticeable difference. I don't feel good. The
[03:19:12.400 --> 03:19:16.720]  nascent iodine is one of the ones that was life-changing for me. Yeah, I've actually
[03:19:16.720 --> 03:19:22.640]  have just run out of my Super Female. I had a few bottles at my house and I've been taking it again,
[03:19:22.640 --> 03:19:28.400]  hitting the gym once again. Very exciting, feeling great, looking good. And I know my hair's
[03:19:29.680 --> 03:19:33.760]  luxurious once again. So obviously Super Female is amazing. I love it.
[03:19:33.760 --> 03:19:39.360]  Nascent iodine is essential. Survival Shield X2. If there's one product that I would say is
[03:19:39.360 --> 03:19:44.800]  life-changing that I would suggest, it's nascent iodine Survival Shield X2. It's got a five-star
[03:19:44.800 --> 03:19:47.760]  rating. It's a win-win at infowarslife.com.
[03:20:14.800 --> 03:20:20.480]  From Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:21.680 --> 03:20:26.800]  All right, my son, Rex Jones, is tweeted at his lordship, the one that cannot be criticized,
[03:20:26.800 --> 03:20:31.840]  even as he cusses at us and calls his names, Lord Hogg. I hope everybody retweets him from
[03:20:31.840 --> 03:20:36.880]  real Alex Jones. And I have the, oh, do we have the video? Did you guys download Rex's new video?
[03:20:36.880 --> 03:20:45.360]  From Twitter? That's a, I love you guys so much, but I want to be able to go to our guest,
[03:20:45.360 --> 03:20:49.200]  so I want to be able to play that. So I want to get that new video that Rex tweeted out because
[03:20:49.200 --> 03:20:55.200]  I want to play that on there. Can we do that? Okay, great. I know I babble a lot and it's hard
[03:20:55.200 --> 03:20:59.120]  to listen to everything I'm saying, but I saw the tweet about 20 minutes ago and they got it done.
[03:20:59.120 --> 03:21:03.600]  I haven't seen the video yet. So it's on real Alex Jones, where he says basically,
[03:21:03.600 --> 03:21:07.920]  he said he was going to challenge Hogg and say, why haven't you debated me and why are you responding
[03:21:07.920 --> 03:21:12.400]  and why are you calling for the end of the first amendment? And then I, that was this morning we
[03:21:12.400 --> 03:21:20.320]  talked and then later Hogg came out and called for the firing of, you know, hosts that criticized
[03:21:20.320 --> 03:21:26.640]  him off Fox News. So it's just a rampant attack. Look at me. I'm a victim. Give me your guns,
[03:21:26.640 --> 03:21:32.800]  give me your free speech. Give me everything. You hurt me. You attacked me. I'm a victim
[03:21:32.800 --> 03:21:39.280]  and I didn't attack you. If somebody runs over you with a car and then you go on the news and say,
[03:21:39.280 --> 03:21:43.520]  you can't criticize any of my political views, because somebody ran into me with a car. It's,
[03:21:43.520 --> 03:21:47.600]  it's, it's leftist buffoonery from the establishment.
[03:21:49.840 --> 03:21:57.200]  So it's on real Alex Jones on infowors.com and we will play it. Now, Joe Gilbert hosts every
[03:21:57.200 --> 03:22:01.520]  Friday does a great job, but he knows part of doing the $4. Sometimes I go a little,
[03:22:01.520 --> 03:22:06.640]  little, little berserky. So we're going to get to him in the next segment. But like I said,
[03:22:06.640 --> 03:22:11.200]  as soon as I have that Twitter, not trying to be OCD about it, I've just asked a few times,
[03:22:12.320 --> 03:22:17.040]  they have not uploaded it yet. Okay. I saw the video in the article. That's what I need to know.
[03:22:17.040 --> 03:22:23.280]  Thank you for that piece of critical, amazing Intel. Thank you. I see, I told Rex, don't make it a
[03:22:23.280 --> 03:22:26.960]  big production. Just do a live, you know, two minute deal, but he's doing something different.
[03:22:26.960 --> 03:22:32.160]  So we're going to see what he does. But again, major news articles, Jones shouldn't allow his
[03:22:32.160 --> 03:22:39.440]  15 year old baby on air. It's abusing him why children can't be on air unless they're David
[03:22:39.440 --> 03:22:46.720]  Hogg and then they can do whatever they want. There it is from the Dawsonburg estate. So now
[03:22:46.720 --> 03:22:56.400]  it's Jones turns his 15 year old son in offending from bullying David Hogg. There you go, ladies
[03:22:56.400 --> 03:23:02.560]  and gentlemen. So David Hogg is the cause celeb that we must fire lower anger. We must give up
[03:23:02.560 --> 03:23:06.800]  the first amendment. We must give up the second amendment. We must Mr. and Mrs. America, turn
[03:23:06.800 --> 03:23:16.640]  them all in or you are a child killer. Turn in your guns, killers, turn in your guns. It's time to
[03:23:16.640 --> 03:23:22.880]  repeal the second amendment or you're a child killer. Boy, that's not authoritarian. That's
[03:23:22.880 --> 03:23:27.040]  not outrageous. That shouldn't make you mad. People looking at you and telling you because
[03:23:27.040 --> 03:23:32.560]  you have a right. It's your fault. You didn't know that when somebody stabs somebody with a knife,
[03:23:33.440 --> 03:23:37.520]  every knife owner is to blame. You didn't know if somebody poisoned someone with
[03:23:38.560 --> 03:23:42.400]  any freeze. If you have any freeze in your car, you're a murderer.
[03:23:46.400 --> 03:23:49.840]  You didn't know that if a jihadi runs over somebody with a truck and it happens to be a
[03:23:49.840 --> 03:23:56.240]  Ford or Chevy, you got a Ford or Chevy. How dare American Ford and Chevy owners. I'm going to
[03:23:56.240 --> 03:24:01.600]  do a man on the street. I'm going to go out in parking lots and I'm going to approach people
[03:24:01.600 --> 03:24:07.200]  like CNN bullies people and I'm going to say, sir, ma'am, what in the hell are you doing? You are
[03:24:07.200 --> 03:24:13.920]  driving a Mercedes car. Did you know a Mercedes truck was used just last year in Berlin to run
[03:24:13.920 --> 03:24:18.800]  over a bunch of people? And again, months before that at a Christmas event, what are you doing
[03:24:18.800 --> 03:24:24.080]  driving this killing machine? They'll be like, well, I'm not associated with that. I didn't do
[03:24:24.080 --> 03:24:30.320]  that with the truck. It doesn't matter. You have this deadly assault vehicle that killed hundreds
[03:24:30.320 --> 03:24:36.320]  of people in Nice that find out the model of the truck in Nice. And there'll be some US subsidiary
[03:24:36.320 --> 03:24:40.160]  and I'm going to go around and I'm going to get in people's faces. I'm going to say, what in the
[03:24:40.160 --> 03:24:46.400]  world are you doing driving a brand vehicle that was associated with running over 270-something
[03:24:46.400 --> 03:24:53.040]  people and killing over 180? And they're going to say, that's the person driving the truck?
[03:24:53.840 --> 03:25:02.080]  No, no, no, you are the killer. You're a murderer. And if you criticize me, you don't care about
[03:25:02.080 --> 03:25:08.080]  those toddlers run over to Nice. You murdered those babies. Now, I want you to kill yourself right
[03:25:08.080 --> 03:25:16.400]  now or I'm going to say, I'm so, so you right now. Every car owner in this country is responsible for Nice.
[03:25:16.400 --> 03:25:19.600]  You murdered those children and you don't even care.
[03:25:25.280 --> 03:25:27.680]  Yeah. Yeah. Now let's go back to it.
[03:25:30.240 --> 03:25:37.040]  Every car owner, every truck owner in the world is a murderer. You murdered children in France,
[03:25:37.040 --> 03:25:43.920]  in Germany, and in New York. And I want all vehicles banned. I agree with the Supreme Court
[03:25:43.920 --> 03:25:53.040]  Justice. I want to repeal the Second Amendment. I want to repeal everything. What kind of vehicle
[03:25:53.040 --> 03:25:58.080]  is that? It was a rental car? Home Depot trip. I can't tell because the front smash.
[03:25:58.080 --> 03:26:05.040]  Is that a Chevy? Is that a Ford? Ford to Chevy, still a last 10 years like they should.
[03:26:05.040 --> 03:26:08.640]  They're zooming on that. What is that? Is that a Chevy or is that a Ford?
[03:26:09.200 --> 03:26:16.080]  Not that it matters, but can you believe that Ford or Chevy? We got some car buffs in there,
[03:26:16.080 --> 03:26:22.560]  right? Can somebody tell what that is? What is that? Is that a Ford or a Chevy? A Ford.
[03:26:23.840 --> 03:26:28.800]  There you go. Ladies and gentlemen, should there be lawsuits against Ford for this?
[03:26:28.800 --> 03:26:34.320]  Just like other manufacturers, should there be lawsuits against Home Depot?
[03:26:36.480 --> 03:26:41.760]  Should they? Absolutely. They knowingly let somebody rent something
[03:26:43.520 --> 03:26:48.080]  that the truck then went out and did. It's like Christine. You parked that truck there,
[03:26:48.080 --> 03:26:52.160]  it starts up, it goes and kills people at night, it pulls back into the bay.
[03:26:53.120 --> 03:26:57.040]  All right. Well, he's coming up. Joel Gilbert straight ahead. Now I'm going to go find out
[03:26:57.040 --> 03:27:02.560]  what's going on with Rex Chard challenging Lord Hoglett. Oh my gosh, I can't just call him Hoglett.
[03:27:02.560 --> 03:27:06.320]  Oh my gosh, I got to be banned off the internet. Sorry. And then all the rest of the news.
[03:27:07.200 --> 03:27:08.320]  There's a lot of clubs as well.
[03:27:12.320 --> 03:27:15.760]  Hillary Clinton Republican Party's being held captive, yeah, by the voters.
[03:27:16.960 --> 03:27:20.080]  And we've got to Hillary Clinton. The Russians are still in our elections.
[03:27:20.080 --> 03:27:27.360]  And we've also got a Trump on the tyranny of gun control and saying it's not going to happen.
[03:27:27.360 --> 03:27:30.000]  And oh, George Ramos is eyeing returning to Mexico.
[03:27:31.360 --> 03:27:34.720]  Well, there's some pretty places in Mexico, but they're all heavily controlled,
[03:27:35.360 --> 03:27:42.240]  like Elon Maheros or a few others. So George, if you hate America so much and it's so racist and
[03:27:42.240 --> 03:27:48.560]  it's so bad and it's so evil that we have less border control than Mexico, don't let the door
[03:27:48.560 --> 03:27:54.720]  hit you on your booty when you go out. Oh my God, I just bullied an Hispanic person,
[03:27:54.720 --> 03:28:02.560]  banned me for that. But as we speak, they've got newspapers all over saying Alex Jones is
[03:28:02.560 --> 03:28:07.920]  exploiting his 15 year old son and holds him captive and makes him say pro gun things.
[03:28:08.640 --> 03:28:13.360]  Now we just accused Jones of saying that, you know, any scripting doesn't exist,
[03:28:13.360 --> 03:28:20.080]  but we're going to accuse him of that now. And we hope his son is removed from YouTube immediately
[03:28:20.080 --> 03:28:24.560]  because after all, no conservatives are allowed to have a voice because we're liberal and we're
[03:28:24.560 --> 03:28:28.880]  fighting Hitler. But if you say we're like Hitler for taking free speech, we won't have you banned
[03:28:28.880 --> 03:28:33.600]  because you're not allowed to call us Hitler. A message from YouTube, a message from your loving
[03:28:33.600 --> 03:28:37.920]  world government state. Don't forget big sales hit percent off brain force, the real red pillar

[03:29:56.800 --> 03:30:04.480]  when you buy t-shirts or water filtration systems or books or videos or other material
[03:30:04.480 --> 03:30:10.640]  from infowarstore.com you are funding the revolution. I mean I cannot say it any
[03:30:10.640 --> 03:30:15.520]  clear and so it is essential that you purchase the products at infowarstore.com. I don't want

[03:30:37.280 --> 03:30:41.520]  stands with America, stands with Trump, stands against the globalists and their satanic pedophile
[03:30:41.520 --> 03:30:45.360]  armies and that's who they are and they know we know who they are and they're coming back
[03:30:45.360 --> 03:30:47.840]  against us so we need your support.
[03:30:47.840 --> 03:30:54.320]  infowarslife is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine introducing pollen block.
[03:30:54.320 --> 03:30:59.680]  We have found an extraordinary new natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms
[03:30:59.680 --> 03:31:03.440]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways,
[03:31:03.440 --> 03:31:10.080]  eye comfort and respiratory functions. In the 1960s researchers in France noticed that people
[03:31:10.080 --> 03:31:15.600]  who ate certain quail eggs experienced less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[03:31:15.600 --> 03:31:20.640]  They began studying this effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit
[03:31:20.640 --> 03:31:26.640]  of this research a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms.
[03:31:26.640 --> 03:31:31.440]  Pollen block is natural and effective. It is not an antihistamine. In fact,
[03:31:31.440 --> 03:31:36.000]  current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of triptase
[03:31:36.000 --> 03:31:40.960]  which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[03:31:40.960 --> 03:31:46.400]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe. Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack
[03:31:46.400 --> 03:31:48.960]  of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[03:31:48.960 --> 03:31:53.440]  InfoWarslife is launching its newest product. We're really really proud of it.
[03:31:53.440 --> 03:32:00.240]  It's a best source prebiotic fiber and it's got the very best concentrated fibers

[03:32:08.880 --> 03:32:13.200]  and it synergistically works with our 50 billion live active culture
[03:32:13.200 --> 03:32:18.480]  fluorolife as well as mycozx that targets the yeast, the mold and the funguses in the gut.
[03:32:18.480 --> 03:32:23.040]  So this is the time to take advantage of getting this new incredible fiber product

[03:32:48.560 --> 03:33:05.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:18.560 --> 03:33:34.240]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show. I'm Joel Gilbert coming to you from Los Angeles right
[03:33:34.240 --> 03:33:40.240]  from the left coast. Don't forget to go to the Alex Jones store and get Trump the art of the
[03:33:40.240 --> 03:33:45.360]  insult. 95 minutes of laughter and you'll get to know Trump. You don't know Trump until you've seen
[03:33:45.360 --> 03:33:53.760]  this movie in the Alex Jones store. I want to welcome my guest it's Dr. Herbert London a former
[03:33:53.760 --> 03:33:59.360]  candidate for governor of New York. He heads up the London Center for Policy Research. It's also
[03:33:59.360 --> 03:34:06.960]  known as a think tank. They do research on key policy issues including national security and
[03:34:06.960 --> 03:34:11.520]  energy and I want to welcome Dr. London on to info wars. How are you today?
[03:34:11.520 --> 03:34:18.320]  It's a pleasure to be with you. Thank you very much. Can you tell our audience what exactly does a
[03:34:18.320 --> 03:34:25.280]  think tank do? What does the London Center do and how do you influence policy in Congress and even
[03:34:25.280 --> 03:34:30.880]  the White House? One of the things that we attempted to do is of course introduce policies
[03:34:30.880 --> 03:34:36.640]  that would make sense for the United States. We don't have any particular partisan agenda.
[03:34:36.640 --> 03:34:42.080]  Our goal is to see whether in fact there are policy issues that would be appropriate for the
[03:34:42.080 --> 03:34:47.120]  United States considering the fact that during the Obama years we did not really have a foreign
[03:34:47.120 --> 03:34:54.240]  policy. So again the way in which we do that we talk to people on the Hill. We organize seminars.
[03:34:54.240 --> 03:34:59.520]  We try very hard to insinuate our ideas into the Trump administration which we have done
[03:34:59.520 --> 03:35:05.840]  so much successfully and so it's always a question of trying to use whatever leverage you have
[03:35:05.840 --> 03:35:12.320]  in order to influence the course of history. Okay so let's start with what do you think led
[03:35:12.320 --> 03:35:17.040]  to the meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un and Trump and what do you think will come of this
[03:35:17.040 --> 03:35:23.360]  meeting? Well as far as the catalyst for it it's very hard to say but my own feeling is
[03:35:23.920 --> 03:35:29.600]  what you have is a regime that is desperate absolutely desperate. Keep in mind that the
[03:35:29.600 --> 03:35:35.920]  GDP of North Korea is about a billion dollars. The GDP of South Korea is more than a trillion
[03:35:35.920 --> 03:35:41.600]  dollars. There's no comparison between the two and it's also true that what you have in Kim Jong
[03:35:41.600 --> 03:35:47.680]  Un is someone who's a third rate fourth rate dictator. The very fact that the president of
[03:35:47.680 --> 03:35:53.600]  the United States would meet with him lends prestige to North Korea. They've won the first battle
[03:35:53.600 --> 03:36:00.400]  but it seems to me that Trump is engaged in a high-wire act and he may turn out to be a very,
[03:36:00.400 --> 03:36:06.560]  very successful wizard turning that wheel behind the curtain. There's no doubt in my mind that what
[03:36:06.560 --> 03:36:13.200]  we have here is an interesting set of events. You have North Korea that has nuclear weapons
[03:36:13.200 --> 03:36:19.680]  but they have nothing else, nothing else in the country. It is dark, it is dank, it is dimwitted
[03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:26.960]  but you have again a South Korea that could provide an awful lot. The very fact that Kim Jong
[03:36:26.960 --> 03:36:33.680]  Un can no longer provide for his own soldiers, can no longer provide for what is necessary
[03:36:33.680 --> 03:36:41.280]  even for the very, very modest introduction of economic reform into the country clearly suggests
[03:36:41.280 --> 03:36:47.760]  that he is amenable to some sort of negotiation. Now, upon Trump one of the things that I would
[03:36:47.760 --> 03:36:54.480]  say the first thing is make sure you get two guarantees before you get on Air Force One,
[03:36:55.200 --> 03:37:01.680]  deluclearization and unlimited, unlimited verification. You get those two things that I
[03:37:01.680 --> 03:37:07.760]  think is appropriate for the president to start engaging in negotiation. After that we can talk
[03:37:07.760 --> 03:37:16.720]  about aid, we can talk about, I don't know, even as many pork bellies as necessary to feed the
[03:37:16.720 --> 03:37:22.880]  population but nothing should occur until those two guarantees are put in place.
[03:37:24.080 --> 03:37:29.520]  Okay, Herb, how do you feel about Trump's tariffs? Will these, how will the tariffs on
[03:37:29.520 --> 03:37:33.440]  steel play out and does Trump have a valid point on national security?
[03:37:34.640 --> 03:37:39.360]  But one of the things you have to understand about tariffs, by and large tariffs are a tax
[03:37:39.360 --> 03:37:45.920]  and I don't like taxes by and large. I mean, overall, it's not very good for the consumer.
[03:37:45.920 --> 03:37:50.400]  And if you're talking about an unfavorable balance of credit, it's a question of what happens to
[03:37:50.400 --> 03:37:55.520]  that unfavorable balance on your side. Do you spend the money adequately? Do you need it for
[03:37:55.520 --> 03:38:02.880]  other industries? Does it create jobs? Very, very difficult to say. So tariffs as a generalization
[03:38:02.880 --> 03:38:08.240]  has to be seen within a certain kind of context. The other point that I would make about this
[03:38:08.240 --> 03:38:13.200]  is that when you're talking about this, the president has already engaged in backsliding.
[03:38:13.200 --> 03:38:19.440]  He is saying now we will negotiate with the Chinese on the $60 billion. So it wasn't as if he said,
[03:38:19.440 --> 03:38:25.440]  you know what, this is blanket reform. We're going to introduce this. He is going to start
[03:38:25.440 --> 03:38:30.640]  a negotiation with the Chinese about the $60 billion. Just as he has already said to the
[03:38:30.640 --> 03:38:38.640]  Europeans and to both Mexico and Canada, we will keep you again outside the realm of this
[03:38:38.640 --> 03:38:44.880]  tariff regimen. So I do think that even though he's imposed these tariffs, we are already seeing
[03:38:44.880 --> 03:38:51.680]  that the president is moving away from them. Okay, look, Donald Trump has criticized nonstop
[03:38:51.680 --> 03:38:56.400]  about his lack of expertise during the campaign and on all the cable channels, of course,
[03:38:56.400 --> 03:39:03.840]  that aren't Fox for the most part. How do you assess his foreign policy successes so far?
[03:39:04.560 --> 03:39:10.720]  And is he really lacking in expertise or is he all instincts and maybe good instincts in the end
[03:39:10.720 --> 03:39:17.680]  of the day? Look, I think that this president is not an intellectual. He would probably admit as
[03:39:17.680 --> 03:39:23.600]  much. But his instincts happen to be very good. And what we have found on the foreign policy front
[03:39:23.600 --> 03:39:29.600]  is that the president, I think, has probably done quite well. If I'm giving him a report card,
[03:39:29.600 --> 03:39:34.720]  I would say probably a B and I'm a tough grader. But I think it's important to understand that
[03:39:34.720 --> 03:39:40.320]  what he's inherited is a very difficult set of situations across the globe. And the president
[03:39:40.320 --> 03:39:45.360]  has to react to them. Most of the nations that were once allied with the United States lost
[03:39:45.360 --> 03:39:50.720]  confidence in America during the Obama years. And he has to restore that confidence.
[03:39:50.720 --> 03:39:56.160]  That's not an easy task. Whether you're talking about C.C. in Egypt or the crown prince in
[03:39:56.160 --> 03:40:03.120]  Saudi Arabia or even Abe in Japan, the president has to reach out to our allies and convince them
[03:40:03.120 --> 03:40:10.160]  that the United States is a dependable ally. Not an easy task, but something that I think he has
[03:40:10.160 --> 03:40:16.720]  done quite well. Well, you wrote a book called Leading from Behind the Obama Doctrine and the
[03:40:16.720 --> 03:40:25.920]  U.S. Retreat. How bad and how much damage did Barack Obama do to the last 50, 60 years of foreign
[03:40:25.920 --> 03:40:32.000]  policy consensus that asserted and projected American power around the world?
[03:40:32.960 --> 03:40:38.720]  Well, Joel, I think you understand this matter very well indeed. But what you had with Obama
[03:40:38.720 --> 03:40:44.000]  was this naive belief that the arc of history was moving in our direction. And it's a consequence
[03:40:44.000 --> 03:40:48.800]  that was not necessary for the United States to engage in any form of intervention, whether it
[03:40:48.800 --> 03:40:53.760]  was military intervention or even peaceful intervention, that the United States was going
[03:40:53.760 --> 03:41:00.080]  to opt out of foreign policy. And so we saw a continual and, I must say, incremental withdrawal
[03:41:00.080 --> 03:41:05.920]  from international affairs. That is one of the reasons why Trump has this difficulty.
[03:41:05.920 --> 03:41:10.960]  If you create a vacuum in international affairs by the departure of the United States,
[03:41:10.960 --> 03:41:16.320]  that vacuum will be filled, very often filled by bad actors. Those actors could be ISIS,
[03:41:16.320 --> 03:41:23.840]  they could be China, they could be the Iranians. But there's no question that that vacuum will
[03:41:23.840 --> 03:41:29.440]  be filled. We have to understand vacuums in international affairs can be very dangerous.
[03:41:29.440 --> 03:41:35.040]  Therefore, American participation is necessary. That doesn't mean that we have to play the
[03:41:35.040 --> 03:41:39.680]  role of policemen in the world. I do not believe that for a moment. But it does mean that the
[03:41:39.680 --> 03:41:44.800]  United States' diplomatic activity is critical in dealing with international affairs.
[03:41:46.240 --> 03:41:50.160]  Okay, we've got about another minute. How do you feel about the personnel changes and the
[03:41:50.160 --> 03:41:56.080]  direction that Trump is heading? We just changed out McMaster for John Bolton at the National
[03:41:56.080 --> 03:42:00.960]  Security Council. Does that make you more comfortable and more optimistic that he's
[03:42:00.960 --> 03:42:06.880]  heading in a direction that will secure America's allies and defenses around the world?
[03:42:06.880 --> 03:42:12.240]  But I know John, I think he's terrific. I think there's a great move on the part of the president.
[03:42:12.240 --> 03:42:16.400]  As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the key moves that have been made by this presidency.
[03:42:17.040 --> 03:42:23.360]  I think that John Bolton has the imagination, as well as a kind of understanding and experience
[03:42:23.360 --> 03:42:27.920]  in international affairs, to make him an ideal candidate, a national security advisor.
[03:42:27.920 --> 03:42:33.600]  I'll tell you, I'll tell you a story very, very briefly. Years ago, when I was the president of
[03:42:33.600 --> 03:42:38.480]  the Hudson Institute, I would hold my watch. We've got about 10 seconds. Let's get the story
[03:42:38.480 --> 03:42:43.440]  at the top of the next segment after the commercial. We'll be right back with Alex Jones showing info.
[03:42:48.400 --> 03:42:52.800]  We need to fund this operation, ladies and gentlemen, and I make it really easy. We went out
[03:42:52.800 --> 03:42:57.680]  and looked at what the top new tropics or brain pills are that are healthy for energy stamina,
[03:42:57.680 --> 03:43:03.200]  mental clarity, you name it. And we created a stronger formula than some of the best-selling
[03:43:03.200 --> 03:43:07.120]  formulas out there. It's very simple. We went out and looked, what is the top? What is the best?
[03:43:07.120 --> 03:43:10.880]  We'll just put even more product in. We'll make it better. Leading competitors put $2
[03:43:10.880 --> 03:43:17.760]  a product in it, sell it for $60. We put $10 in it and sell it for $30. It's $19.95 right now.
[03:43:17.760 --> 03:43:23.680]  So you get an incredible top of the line new tropic for $19.95. Believe me, we're selling it
[03:43:23.680 --> 03:43:28.320]  for $35 on average. We need that $15, $20. We make to fund this operation in the face of
[03:43:28.320 --> 03:43:32.880]  the global threat of it. But I'm doing this because we got a ton of it coming in in two weeks.
[03:43:32.880 --> 03:43:37.520]  I want to sell it all out before the big supply comes in. And I want people that haven't tried
[03:43:37.520 --> 03:43:43.280]  BrainForce to try it and find out why. It's got 6,000 plus five-star reviews. It's amazing.

[03:46:47.120 --> 03:46:57.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:17.120 --> 03:47:24.880]  Welcome back to infowars. Joel Gilbert coming to you right from the left coast. We want to
[03:47:24.880 --> 03:47:31.680]  finish up with Dr. Herbert London of the London Center for Policy Research. Herb, we wanted you
[03:47:31.680 --> 03:47:39.360]  to share a story about one of your experiences when I asked you about the NSC. But this is a story
[03:47:39.360 --> 03:47:45.840]  about John Bolton and it involves a colleague of mine at the Hudson Institute, Robert Pork,
[03:47:45.840 --> 03:47:51.600]  who you may remember was converted into a verb, Robert as fast as mortal coil, but was a great
[03:47:51.600 --> 03:47:58.000]  friend, an extraordinary jurist, perhaps the finest jurist in America, former solicitor general,
[03:47:58.000 --> 03:48:03.520]  and at the same time someone who taught at Yale Law School for several years, several decades.
[03:48:03.520 --> 03:48:10.080]  During that period, when he was at Yale Law School, he taught every power elite individual
[03:48:10.080 --> 03:48:16.400]  in Washington D.C. Whether it was Hillary Clinton, Bill Clinton, John Kerry, I mean, you go down the
[03:48:16.400 --> 03:48:22.560]  list. There's probably no one of note who didn't study constitutional law with Robert Pork.
[03:48:23.200 --> 03:48:27.920]  During the course of lunch, I said to Robert, you know, tell me about your students. And he said,
[03:48:27.920 --> 03:48:35.760]  you know, I've taught everyone of any power or influence in Washington. And I said to him,
[03:48:35.760 --> 03:48:42.160]  who is the best student you ever had? He looked at me and he said, that's easy. I said, that's easy
[03:48:42.160 --> 03:48:47.520]  based on all the experience that you've had. He said, yes, by far the most intelligent, the most
[03:48:47.520 --> 03:48:54.160]  imaginative student I ever had at a Yale Law School was John Bolton. Now that's high praise.
[03:48:55.760 --> 03:48:59.600]  That's that's high praise. That's a fabulous story since he's coming on only in a few days.
[03:49:00.560 --> 03:49:05.360]  Dr. London, thanks for being here and appreciate all your insight to all the audience here at
[03:49:05.360 --> 03:49:08.720]  Infowars. Thank you. Always a pleasure to be with you. Thank you.
[03:49:10.640 --> 03:49:16.960]  Okay, folks. Look, I want to talk about how this week Donald Trump went after Amazon again.
[03:49:17.760 --> 03:49:22.480]  In the tweet, he said they pay little or no taxes to state and local governments and they
[03:49:22.480 --> 03:49:28.480]  use our postal system as their delivery boy. And they're putting out many thousands of retailers
[03:49:28.480 --> 03:49:34.160]  out of business. So what I want to do today in this last segment is let's look at what and who
[03:49:34.160 --> 03:49:40.480]  is behind Amazon. Could it be the deep state or what I call the police state? Let's look at some
[03:49:40.480 --> 03:49:46.880]  facts. Did you know that Amazon was not profitable until about three or four years ago, they were
[03:49:46.880 --> 03:49:53.040]  only breaking even or losing money because they low ball their products. Amazon had very high
[03:49:53.040 --> 03:49:59.920]  revenue and no profit. What changed three or four years ago? Well, what changed was CEO Jeff Bezos
[03:49:59.920 --> 03:50:06.400]  became a mega billionaire and the richest man on the planet. And his stock price went up to $1,500
[03:50:06.400 --> 03:50:16.240]  per share because of the deep state. In 2013, Amazon got a $600 million contract from the CIA
[03:50:16.240 --> 03:50:20.720]  to create a computer cloud service. That was the whole difference. That's what turned Amazon around.
[03:50:21.440 --> 03:50:28.240]  In fact, it was an insider deal between Amazon and the CIA. IBM had to sue the government
[03:50:28.240 --> 03:50:35.440]  because the CIA broke the law that requires open bidding for government contracts. And guess what?
[03:50:35.440 --> 03:50:42.960]  IBM lost in court a judge named Thomas Wheeler, who later upheld Obamacare, ruled in favor of the
[03:50:42.960 --> 03:50:49.360]  CIA. And you know, you wonder why. So later that same year, Jeff Bezos buys the Washington Post
[03:50:49.360 --> 03:50:55.360]  for $250 million. This is a guy with no cash except for the $600 million that the CIA gave him.
[03:50:55.360 --> 03:51:02.000]  And Business Insider Magazine wrote, Jeff Bezos didn't waste too much time before signing the $250
[03:51:02.000 --> 03:51:08.560]  million deal. Bezos said, I did no due diligence. I did not negotiate for the Washington Post.
[03:51:08.560 --> 03:51:15.280]  I just accepted the first number they proposed. So Bezos buys the Washington Post with the CIA
[03:51:15.280 --> 03:51:23.120]  money, a leftist newspaper, favorite of the CIA, publisher of leaks. And essentially half the money
[03:51:23.120 --> 03:51:28.800]  he got from the CIA, he turned around and unquestioned bought the Washington Post, which often
[03:51:28.800 --> 03:51:35.280]  quotes unnamed CIA sources in their reporting. Of course, the Post doesn't disclose that the CIA
[03:51:35.280 --> 03:51:42.160]  paid the owner of their newspaper twice what it cost to buy the newspaper for a website. Remember
[03:51:42.160 --> 03:51:50.400]  Obamacare website, they paid $2 billion. So who was the CIA director when this deal with Amazon,
[03:51:50.400 --> 03:51:56.640]  the Washington Post was finalized? It was John Brennan. John Brennan, the corrupt CIA director,
[03:51:56.640 --> 03:52:03.680]  the political operative, the Obama campaign advisor. He's been a loyal progressive Democrat
[03:52:03.680 --> 03:52:10.160]  since he voted Communist Party in 1976. So wouldn't you like to see an investigation into the
[03:52:10.160 --> 03:52:15.840]  collusion between John Brennan, Jeff Bezos, Amazon, the Washington Post, and the CIA?
[03:52:15.840 --> 03:52:23.680]  Now, Brennan was in the news again this week in his new gig as a MSNBC analyst. Let's see what
[03:52:24.560 --> 03:52:27.680]  Brennan had to say about Trump on video just this past week.
[03:52:28.320 --> 03:52:37.040]  He is mean-spirited. He is dishonest. He has shown a lack of integrity. And he has continued to,
[03:52:37.040 --> 03:52:41.360]  I think, to be in the office of the presidency. Do you believe he's somehow in debt to the president
[03:52:41.360 --> 03:52:46.480]  of Russia? I think he's afraid of the president of Russia. Why? Well, I think one can speculate as
[03:52:46.480 --> 03:52:51.200]  to why that the Russians may have something on him personally, that they could always roll out and
[03:52:51.200 --> 03:52:57.440]  make his life more difficult. So here, John Brennan is exposing himself as a political operative.
[03:52:58.160 --> 03:53:04.480]  You can only imagine what went on at the CIA with this guy's leadership. But it's very rich that
[03:53:05.120 --> 03:53:10.240]  Brennan thinks the Russians might have something on Trump. Brennan's guy, as you know from my film
[03:53:10.240 --> 03:53:15.840]  Dreams for My Real Father, Brennan's guy, Obama, by his own admission was raised by a Soviet agent,
[03:53:15.840 --> 03:53:21.120]  Frank Marshall Davis in Hawaii. And there's a mountain of evidence that Davis is Obama's real
[03:53:21.120 --> 03:53:28.880]  father. The Kenyan student was just a sham marriage. Now, you wonder how that would play and how
[03:53:28.880 --> 03:53:36.160]  Putin could control Obama by exposing his real background because his father was a Russian agent.
[03:53:36.160 --> 03:53:41.200]  Let's look at an excerpt from my interview with Malik Obama from a few years ago where he talks
[03:53:41.200 --> 03:53:46.480]  about Frank Marshall Davis. Frank Marshall Davis, fairly well-known poet named Frank Marshall Davis,
[03:53:46.480 --> 03:53:52.800]  who had moved to Hawaii. Frank Marshall Davis. Do you think that Barack looks like Frank Marshall
[03:53:52.800 --> 03:53:59.280]  Davis? This is a man that he said raised him. There's a great resemblance. Yeah, I think Frank
[03:53:59.280 --> 03:54:06.400]  Marshall Davis and Barack, they look alike. Some kind of bulls I see on his face and Frank, he has
[03:54:06.400 --> 03:54:13.520]  those two. There's a resemblance. And does he resemble your father? Not really. I don't, you
[03:54:13.520 --> 03:54:24.240]  know, they say about the years and no, no. So here we have Brennan continuing the Russia, Russia,
[03:54:24.240 --> 03:54:31.040]  Russia narrative that somehow Trump was colluding with and is controlled by Putin. But the only
[03:54:31.040 --> 03:54:37.280]  thing that explains Obama's pro-Russia policies, especially during his first term, was because
[03:54:38.480 --> 03:54:44.800]  Obama was controlled by Putin. Don't forget Obama removed the missile shield from Eastern Europe
[03:54:45.600 --> 03:54:51.040]  that Putin desperately wanted out. Of course, the famous reset that ended up transferring all this
[03:54:51.040 --> 03:54:56.160]  technology that was forbidden to Russia, the U.S. approval of uranium-1, transferring our
[03:54:57.520 --> 03:55:03.360]  uranium deposits to a Russian company. And as Herb London spoke earlier about how Russia's
[03:55:03.360 --> 03:55:07.600]  number one foreign policy goal to get America to retreat from the world so they could fill
[03:55:07.600 --> 03:55:13.520]  the vacuum of power in Syria and Crimea in Ukraine, Obama implemented Russian policy
[03:55:13.520 --> 03:55:21.200]  called leading from behind. So everything indicates that this secret of Obama's that was very
[03:55:21.200 --> 03:55:26.320]  dangerous for him to take to the White House put America in jeopardy that his real father was a
[03:55:26.320 --> 03:55:32.320]  Russian agent. Let's look at the video of Obama and Medvedev in that context when they were speaking
[03:55:32.320 --> 03:55:50.960]  before the 2012 election. A few months ago, when you were asked what's the biggest geopolitical
[03:55:50.960 --> 03:55:57.520]  threat facing America, you said Russia, not al-Qaeda, you said Russia. In the 1980s are now calling
[03:55:57.520 --> 03:56:02.000]  to ask for their foreign policy back because the Cold War has been over for 20 years.
[03:56:21.120 --> 03:56:27.120]  You know, I transmit this information to Vladimir. That conversation between Obama and Medvedev
[03:56:27.120 --> 03:56:32.080]  should have led to an immediate special counsel and talk of impeachment. It wasn't a scene from a
[03:56:32.080 --> 03:56:38.160]  movie. The American president was begging for time saying, if I just have a little more time when
[03:56:39.040 --> 03:56:45.520]  I get past the election, can you get me some more time and I'll do your bidding. And Medvedev says,
[03:56:45.520 --> 03:56:50.480]  I stand with you, I will transmit this to Vladimir. That should have been a special counsel. So the
[03:56:50.480 --> 03:56:56.320]  United States has just wasted all this time and energy on this ridiculous probe of Trump
[03:56:56.320 --> 03:57:03.600]  when I think all this time the person who was controlled by Putin was absolutely Barack Obama
[03:57:03.600 --> 03:57:09.360]  and that's the only way you can explain his pro-Russia policies. Everyone please, if you haven't
[03:57:09.360 --> 03:57:14.240]  seen it, check out Dreams to My Real Father. Of course, Trump, the art of the insult in the
[03:57:14.240 --> 03:57:19.440]  Alex Jones store. It's very important to buy it from the Alex Jones store only to help support

[03:57:38.480 --> 03:57:43.600]  They use their media to assassinate real news. They use their schools to teach children that
[03:57:43.600 --> 03:57:49.440]  their president is another Hitler. They use their movie stars and singers and comedy shows and award
[03:57:49.440 --> 03:57:54.960]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again. And then they use their ex-president to
[03:57:54.960 --> 03:58:01.520]  endorse the resistance. All to make them march, make them protest, make them scream racism and
[03:58:01.520 --> 03:58:07.760]  sexism and xenophobia and homophobia, to smash windows, burn cars, shut down interstates and
[03:58:07.760 --> 03:58:13.760]  airports, bully and terrorize the law-abiding. Until the only option left is for the police
[03:58:13.760 --> 03:58:19.760]  to do their jobs and stop the madness. And when that happens, they'll use it as an excuse for
[03:58:19.760 --> 03:58:26.880]  their outrage. The only way we stop this, the only way we save our country and our freedom
[03:58:26.880 --> 03:58:34.320]  is to fight this violence of lies with a clenched fist of truth. I'm the National Rifle Association
