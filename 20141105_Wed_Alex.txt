[00:00.000 --> 00:13.500]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.500 --> 00:22.280]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.280 --> 00:31.360]  well it is official there's no other way to put it is a major political
[00:31.360 --> 00:37.400]  realignment the Democrats have had the biggest losses they've had since 1920
[00:37.400 --> 00:46.640]  pre-depression level information this is a total political realignment and
[00:46.640 --> 00:53.080]  listening to syndicated talk radio watching Fox CNN MSNBC ABC last night
[00:53.080 --> 00:57.080]  monitoring and all in between broadcasting with the great crew doing
[00:57.080 --> 01:03.200]  our own nightly news for six hours and then watching hours of news and reading
[01:03.200 --> 01:08.680]  hundreds of articles or scanning over hundreds of articles we can see the new
[01:08.680 --> 01:13.960]  battle configuration the talking point is this is a repudiation of the Tea
[01:13.960 --> 01:20.120]  Party but as a political realignment and an endorsement of the Republican
[01:20.120 --> 01:27.700]  establishment what it is is the establishment wanting us to have a
[01:27.700 --> 01:34.840]  fake revolution and have business as usual and then have people in two to four
[01:34.840 --> 01:40.320]  to six years disenfranchised with the Republicans and run back to the Democrats
[01:40.320 --> 01:44.040]  it doesn't work like that you're not going to just have people get mad in
[01:44.040 --> 01:49.520]  four to eight years and then have a few percentage point move you're having
[01:49.520 --> 01:53.600]  massive moves that are realignment level and they're happening quicker and
[01:53.600 --> 01:59.080]  quicker because time is compacted now because of technological and societal
[01:59.080 --> 02:04.440]  developments accelerations and pressure so the Republican establishment is not
[02:04.440 --> 02:09.920]  going to spin this and then just sit back and continue Obamacare they helped
[02:09.920 --> 02:15.760]  right the Republican leadership went along with it whether it was Mitch
[02:15.760 --> 02:25.000]  McConnell or John Boehner or people like Mittens Romney same story and they are at
[02:25.000 --> 02:31.760]  war with the Tea Party that is just classic Americana low taxes second
[02:31.760 --> 02:36.160]  amendment private property the family the Tea Party has its own problems it
[02:36.160 --> 02:43.280]  loves war on average you know torture watching 24 delusional stuff like that
[02:43.280 --> 02:49.240]  Team America stuff but not so much anymore it's so libertarian now where
[02:49.240 --> 02:55.880]  the Tea Party began eight years ago on record with the Ron Paul movement the
[02:55.880 --> 03:00.120]  next to last time he ran for president that there's a real struggle and so they
[03:00.120 --> 03:03.880]  have the talking point out there saying this is a repudiation of the Tea Party
[03:03.880 --> 03:07.840]  Tea Party candidates got elected at the state level and some to Congress at the
[03:07.840 --> 03:14.400]  federal level all over the country but it was Tea Party sentiment and anger that
[03:14.400 --> 03:19.280]  drove the historic shift as the Republicans gained what 16 more seats in
[03:19.280 --> 03:22.840]  the house a whole bunch of seats are gaining control of the Senate we're
[03:22.840 --> 03:30.600]  going to go over the numbers today this is a big big big deal and it's a
[03:30.600 --> 03:34.240]  political realignment CNN's like we congratulate the Republicans and the
[03:34.240 --> 03:40.640]  president does on their win no it was a repudiation of Obama now here's the
[03:40.640 --> 03:48.960]  64 trillion dollar issue are the Republicans gonna repeal Obamacare or
[03:48.960 --> 03:53.200]  just tinker with it and claim they did by removing a few pieces are they gonna
[03:53.200 --> 04:00.320]  let Obama go for total amnesty will Obama officiate what's already going on
[04:00.320 --> 04:04.360]  will Obama certify the fact the borders are already wide open I mean that's a
[04:04.360 --> 04:08.600]  fact Jack will he do that will they let him act as a dictator for two years now
[04:08.600 --> 04:14.600]  that they quote have the power that's why there's a move from Fox to CNN to
[04:14.600 --> 04:19.840]  syndicated conservative radio with these pundits on to say repudiation of Tea
[04:19.840 --> 04:25.720]  Party certification of Republican blue bloods when any real analysis of that
[04:25.720 --> 04:31.240]  shows that's a fraud and his credit he knows where his audience is Rush
[04:31.240 --> 04:34.960]  Limbaugh came out last night and said the same thing he said if the Republicans
[04:34.960 --> 04:39.520]  would have fully endorsed libertarian Tea Party paleo-conservative ideas they
[04:39.520 --> 04:44.360]  would have had an even bigger landslide of course they would CNN this morning
[04:44.360 --> 04:48.840]  and MSNBC had their experts going these are good Republicans settle down work
[04:48.840 --> 04:52.640]  with us that's how you're gonna win don't get aggressive don't get radical
[04:52.640 --> 04:57.640]  don't call us out because we can literally destroy them now if we get

[10:07.040 --> 10:11.800]  it waging war on corruption broadcasting worldwide
[10:11.800 --> 10:21.280]  November 5th 2014 on this Wednesday edition a truly historic day a truly
[10:21.280 --> 10:31.000]  historic broadcast this is a near total mega political realignment one of the
[10:31.000 --> 10:37.840]  biggest peaceful political realignments not just in US history but in Western
[10:37.840 --> 10:44.280]  electoral history Republicans have every congressional seat in Arkansas a
[10:44.280 --> 10:51.880]  Democrat state just six years ago Republicans elected black women to
[10:51.880 --> 10:57.880]  Congress Republicans elected young women to Congress Republicans elected
[10:57.880 --> 11:03.680]  Hispanics to high office Republicans across the board in southern states
[11:03.680 --> 11:07.920]  elected the first black men for the Republican ticket in the Congress since
[11:07.920 --> 11:16.240]  right after the Civil War it goes on and on and on a massive repudiation of the
[11:16.240 --> 11:21.840]  entire establishment last night during our six hours of live coverage of the
[11:21.840 --> 11:25.640]  crew did an excellent job and all the other hosts here at info wars nightly
[11:25.640 --> 11:32.920]  news and syndicated operations but it was still disgusting to cut to the
[11:32.920 --> 11:38.400]  different Republican victory speeches where it was just the same old Republican
[11:38.400 --> 11:42.520]  country club types with their connections to the big banks and the
[11:42.520 --> 11:46.280]  people that helped write Obamacare the Republicans that compromise on
[11:46.280 --> 11:50.520]  restricting the Second Amendment and the police state and the warmongering we
[11:50.520 --> 11:58.080]  have our work cut out for us but at the same time it is a huge sign that the
[11:58.080 --> 12:05.160]  Democrats are at the weakest position they've been since 1920 pre depression
[12:05.160 --> 12:12.400]  numbers the Democratic Party has been routed across the board here's the
[12:12.400 --> 12:16.200]  problem the globalists have the Republican blue blood leadership waging
[12:16.200 --> 12:21.360]  war on the Tea Party and their own constituents circling the wagons now
[12:21.360 --> 12:26.280]  announcing they're going to go after the Tea Party now because they understand
[12:26.280 --> 12:31.640]  that's on their flank they just want to be in power they want business as usual
[12:31.640 --> 12:35.400]  that's why they all got up with talking points the blue blood candidates that
[12:35.400 --> 12:40.120]  won riding the Tea Party wave and said we want to get things done we want to
[12:40.120 --> 12:44.960]  pass all these bills we want to get this Pacific partnership done we want to
[12:44.960 --> 12:49.640]  you know get these energy deals done what they mean is they want to water
[12:49.640 --> 12:56.360]  down the globalist agenda on the surface and ram it through you notice we
[12:56.360 --> 13:00.320]  don't hear from Mitch McConnell or John Boehner about repealing Obamacare we
[13:00.320 --> 13:08.880]  hear about quote fixing parts of it you don't fix something written to
[13:08.880 --> 13:13.520]  selectively jack up taxes on people and double and triple their premiums the
[13:13.520 --> 13:17.000]  average premiums already doubled everyone I know it's gone up at least 70%
[13:17.000 --> 13:24.760]  some people it's doubled tripled now they say get ready this fall and next year
[13:24.760 --> 13:30.920]  this fall into the winter in the next year for it to go up even more
[13:32.320 --> 13:36.360]  they've already gone up on my dad almost a hundred percent he just got a
[13:36.360 --> 13:38.680]  letter last week he showed me when I was his house this weekend with the kids
[13:38.680 --> 13:44.960]  and they said you and your wife have not had a claim since 1990 but it just
[13:44.960 --> 13:49.760]  doesn't matter you're gonna be fined $5,000 by Obamacare because our rate is
[13:49.760 --> 13:54.440]  too low and you're supposed to buy this amount each year here are my parents
[13:54.440 --> 14:01.280]  both 66 and they never use their insurance and they're healthy and they've
[14:01.280 --> 14:06.280]  just been told we've got to increase your premium $250 a month and they've
[14:06.280 --> 14:11.720]  already jacked it up so the big insurance companies got together and wrote a
[14:11.720 --> 14:16.120]  monumental screw job where they get half the increase and the government
[14:16.120 --> 14:19.640]  gets the other half as a tax it surveils everything you do it brings in
[14:19.640 --> 14:25.680]  control and now mcconnell has come out right after he won and said no shut
[14:25.680 --> 14:31.760]  downs of the government and no full Obamacare repeal but it doesn't matter
[14:31.760 --> 14:36.160]  his wife's wearing a pretty red dress and smiling and has nice hair and nice
[14:36.160 --> 14:43.400]  makeup I'm going to puke Mitch McConnell tried to defeat Rand Paul when he was
[14:43.400 --> 14:49.760]  running for the Senate against the Democrats when Rand Paul won he took
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.360]  him under his wing and I think Rand Paul needs to get out from underneath
[14:53.360 --> 15:00.400]  Mitch McConnell's wing I'm gonna vomit of course on the same news article I'm
[15:00.400 --> 15:06.760]  looking at there's a picture of Boehner who behind the scenes is holding hands
[15:06.760 --> 15:09.880]  not with Obama sure he plays golf with him and smokes cigarettes and drinks
[15:09.880 --> 15:14.800]  with him I could care less about that part that's the only human part of
[15:14.800 --> 15:18.040]  these people behind the scenes the same special interests are holding hands
[15:18.040 --> 15:22.640]  running this and I know you know this that's why you're the enemy of the
[15:22.640 --> 15:27.040]  establishment because you know the game you know we've been conquered by fraud
[15:27.040 --> 15:31.640]  you know the narrative of truth that if we put it out there will bring these
[15:31.640 --> 15:36.280]  people down and that's why the talking point on every channel whether it was
[15:36.280 --> 15:40.680]  conservative or libertarian or liberal or establishment all the state run
[15:40.680 --> 15:45.760]  affiliate media was saying a repudiation of the Tea Party a repudiation of
[15:45.760 --> 15:51.920]  Obama tying the two together when their polar opposites and an endorsement of
[15:51.920 --> 16:01.160]  establishment Republicans so the system is now lashing out at its real enemy
[16:01.160 --> 16:07.000]  they're going to give us lip service they're going to tinker with Obama's
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.880]  blank and amnesty they're going to criticize him on the surface but they're
[16:11.880 --> 16:15.080]  gonna let the whole agenda continue because the people that own this country
[16:15.080 --> 16:20.720]  through fraud want that even Rush Limbaugh's come out and says drive by
[16:20.720 --> 16:26.680]  media and GOP establishment team up to spin elections as repudiation of Tea
[16:26.680 --> 16:31.360]  Party I gotta hand it to Rush Limbaugh I feel sorry for him he's hard to
[16:31.360 --> 16:36.520]  understand now because he's ear hearing impaired but he got really bad under
[16:36.520 --> 16:40.760]  Bush going with the establishment but he knows where his bread's buttered with
[16:40.760 --> 16:44.160]  his listeners especially and he knows they're all libertarian conservatives
[16:44.160 --> 16:47.280]  basically and that they understand what's going on and he's come right out
[16:47.280 --> 16:51.680]  and told the truth but I was sitting there watching it last night and
[16:51.680 --> 16:55.400]  covering it and I that's clearly what was going on so the reason Rush Limbaugh
[16:55.400 --> 16:59.280]  seeing exactly what I'm saying is not because we got some memo from the
[16:59.280 --> 17:05.960]  stork that dropped it down the chimney it's because that's the truth and it's
[17:05.960 --> 17:10.840]  the establishment Republicans that if they would have just embraced reform
[17:10.840 --> 17:14.760]  going back to the Republic going back to it what made us so exceptional and so
[17:14.760 --> 17:22.040]  great and so wealthy and so admired and so loved they would have had a total
[17:22.040 --> 17:27.160]  sweep and they already had a massive devastating victory but it was the
[17:27.160 --> 17:34.000]  people's victory it was a repudiation and it was Republican voters voting for
[17:34.000 --> 17:40.040]  blacks black women Hispanic women young women because they had good rhetoric and
[17:40.040 --> 17:43.200]  had been in local office and done good things let's say I could care less if
[17:43.200 --> 17:48.920]  somebody's black if they'll leave my guns alone and cut my taxes believe me
[17:48.920 --> 17:53.440]  that quite frankly about a choice over a black conservative libertarian or a
[17:53.440 --> 17:56.720]  white conservative libertarian I'd vote for the black conservative libertarian
[17:56.720 --> 18:00.960]  just because I want to get blacks off the plantation and vote for free market so
[18:00.960 --> 18:06.800]  I mean I guess I am discriminatory I would vote for a minority patriot over a
[18:06.800 --> 18:13.040]  white a patriot because we need I agree with Rand Paul on this to broaden the
[18:13.040 --> 18:21.320]  base but you don't do that by waddling in to the middle of the situation and
[18:21.320 --> 18:25.840]  saying okay we'll be nice we'll accept the 60 million it's got to be like 60
[18:25.840 --> 18:29.040]  million it's not 35 million it's way more everybody knows that it's off the
[18:29.040 --> 18:33.640]  chart of all these illegals and then just accept them and say we'll do whatever
[18:33.640 --> 18:36.760]  you want for a North American Union because that's what this is about is
[18:36.760 --> 18:40.520]  breaking this country up and of course I'm being a bit tongue-in-cheek I'm not
[18:40.520 --> 18:43.600]  a discriminatory type person I would study the candidate found who the very
[18:43.600 --> 18:48.400]  best was but if they were almost the same candidate and I couldn't decide it
[18:48.400 --> 18:54.120]  was better I might just to change the face of the Republican Party go with a
[18:54.120 --> 19:00.200]  minority because I don't care I just want freedom I care about the content of
[19:00.200 --> 19:05.080]  somebody's brain and their actions and I'm sick of the good old boy networks of
[19:05.080 --> 19:11.680]  the Ku Klux Klan run Democratic Party and this is a giant rejection of race
[19:11.680 --> 19:15.440]  based politics they jump the shark they went whole hog saying turn your guns
[19:15.440 --> 19:19.960]  in accept Obamacare your families aren't good and if you don't agree with us
[19:19.960 --> 19:23.360]  you're a racist you're a homophobe you're a sexist if you don't like Hillary
[19:23.360 --> 19:27.920]  Clinton everywhere she campaigned for people were the biggest nose-dives she
[19:27.920 --> 19:33.560]  campaigned heavily in Arkansas total Republican takeover it doesn't work
[19:33.560 --> 19:38.720]  anymore and so it's a repudiation of race-based politics I don't think they're
[19:38.720 --> 19:42.720]  dead but they're on their knees and they're going out if we want it to

[24:20.960 --> 24:30.840]  that he's just a fool and he never gives an answer but the fool on the hill sees the
[24:30.840 --> 24:42.320]  sun going down and the eyes in his head see the world scream rise truly historic
[24:42.320 --> 24:47.800]  what we're seeing a very good sign that despite the fact that America is so sick
[24:47.800 --> 24:53.440]  of Republicans so sick of country club blue bloods with their crony capitalism
[24:53.440 --> 24:58.160]  getting their SNL bailout money and getting their no-bid weapons contracts
[24:58.160 --> 25:04.200]  and trying to create North American Union and Bush signing it in secret with
[25:04.200 --> 25:11.320]  Paul Martin and Vicente Fox in 2005 in Waco Texas we're sick of both parties we
[25:11.320 --> 25:16.520]  know they're disgusting we know that Congress needs a giant enema basically
[25:16.520 --> 25:20.160]  and I'm sorry to use a term like that but we all know what's going on up there
[25:20.160 --> 25:27.080]  as Mark Twain said politicians are like diapers and both should be changed
[25:27.080 --> 25:34.120]  frequently for the same reason it comes down to that but they really are a
[25:34.120 --> 25:42.520]  reflection of we the people and the fact that Republicans were desperate for
[25:42.520 --> 25:46.400]  change and got fooled into voting for Obama to put him into office and then
[25:46.400 --> 25:51.680]  now they're desperate for change and they voted in a mixed field of Republicans
[25:51.680 --> 25:55.680]  some of them we don't know who they are some of them are establishment others
[25:55.680 --> 25:59.600]  look like really good tea party type folks the fact that the system is going
[25:59.600 --> 26:04.480]  after the tea party and the mainstream state-run media is teaming up I was
[26:04.480 --> 26:09.040]  watching all these former White House officials from Obama's camp on MSNBC
[26:09.040 --> 26:13.040]  this morning going these are reasonable establishment Republicans that want to
[26:13.040 --> 26:18.080]  get things done Obama is calling them all this is very good we're going to
[26:18.080 --> 26:21.880]  stop the extremist tea party together and if the Republicans want to expand
[26:21.880 --> 26:26.320]  their lead they just need to be reasonable the only reason the
[26:26.320 --> 26:31.000]  Republicans gained all these seats was because the ideas of liberty were being
[26:31.000 --> 26:36.120]  demanded and a lot of Republicans picked up that rhetoric they're gonna be out on
[26:36.120 --> 26:42.040]  their butts as well if they don't deliver and the Democrats are going to move
[26:42.040 --> 26:47.040]  and the announcements been made by Obama will play a clip in a moment that they
[26:47.040 --> 26:53.200]  are going to go for amnesty by Christmas and then Obama doesn't care what it does
[26:53.200 --> 26:58.520]  the Democrats that's because it won't matter governor Moonbeam who wants to ban
[26:58.520 --> 27:03.400]  all guns and who's wrecked California came out and of course got reelected last
[27:03.400 --> 27:08.920]  night in a landslide and they basically merged us with Latin America and the
[27:08.920 --> 27:15.600]  takeovers happening so won't matter in a couple years because the states won't be
[27:15.600 --> 27:20.000]  able to stop the illegals from voting and then they will vote for the Democrats
[27:20.000 --> 27:25.000]  and it will be checkmate so we're already in check right now and if we
[27:25.000 --> 27:29.000]  don't get out of check playing this chess game right now the globalists who
[27:29.000 --> 27:32.320]  want their North American Union and they want to be able to do whatever they
[27:32.320 --> 27:37.800]  want are gonna win so we all better who support liberty regardless of what
[27:37.800 --> 27:46.200]  color you are better reach out to all of the white trendies and all of the quote
[27:46.200 --> 27:50.400]  minorities are really the majority worldwide and say do you really want
[27:50.400 --> 27:54.360]  socialism and collectivism do you really want to pay trillions in banker
[27:54.360 --> 27:57.960]  bailouts that are bipartisanly being pushed do you really want to go with a
[27:57.960 --> 28:09.160]  Democratic Party who would pass Obamacare and our screw jobs meant to
[28:09.160 --> 28:12.840]  bankrupt the country and make you go on welfare so they can control you as a
[28:12.840 --> 28:18.600]  political class and in his victory speech last night Governor Brown said it
[28:18.600 --> 28:22.120]  doesn't matter whether you're born here or whether you're here illegally welcome
[28:22.120 --> 28:27.880]  this is your state and it's its own rotting country its problem is though
[28:27.880 --> 28:34.280]  even though it's a beautiful state I love it from the central area on up and a
[28:34.280 --> 28:39.360]  lot of great people most those people are fleeing because they can't live under
[28:39.360 --> 28:43.080]  the socialism under the social engineering under the nightmare situation
[28:43.080 --> 28:49.960]  so here's the headline report executive amnesty no matter how big a shellacking
[28:49.960 --> 28:55.200]  for Democrats let's go ahead and play that clip from ABC news officials tell
[28:55.200 --> 28:58.720]  me the president is prepared to aggressively pursue his agenda using
[28:58.720 --> 29:02.200]  his power of executive authority where he can't use work with Congress and the
[29:02.200 --> 29:06.360]  big one is going to be on immigration reform White House officials tell me
[29:06.360 --> 29:09.760]  that the president will move forward with an executive order on immigration
[29:09.760 --> 29:14.160]  reform no matter how big a shellacking Democrats get tonight so let me say
[29:14.160 --> 29:19.480]  this very very calmly okay we were told in January this by the board of
[29:19.480 --> 29:26.040]  patrol we proved it with our cameras three months later okay I must say this
[29:26.040 --> 29:30.200]  very slowly for new listeners the boarders already open the board of
[29:30.200 --> 29:33.520]  patrol is forced to load the illegals on buses and ship them to Democratic
[29:33.520 --> 29:37.800]  facilities where they're signed up to vote and given welfare they've also made
[29:37.800 --> 29:41.920]  a deal bipartisan to take over all the major apartment complexes and house the
[29:41.920 --> 29:46.600]  illegals with federal funds section 8 housing okay it is a giant criminal
[29:46.600 --> 29:51.040]  conspiracy it's bipartisan with the blue blood Republicans we're on the March the

[35:20.680 --> 35:24.960]  so busy doing radio interviews working on the nightly news doing the radio show
[35:24.960 --> 35:29.160]  doing research and a bunch of family stuff that's come up in the last year
[35:29.160 --> 35:33.600]  that we are about 10 months behind here but by the new year it's all going to be
[35:33.600 --> 35:37.520]  done all going to be launched and you'll be able to call stations in your area
[35:37.520 --> 35:43.160]  UHF VHF cable systems so many of the owners and managers or listeners it's
[35:43.160 --> 35:47.800]  just insane the contacts we've got I mean broadcast TV stations in Houston
[35:47.800 --> 35:52.360]  broadcast TV stations in Atlanta broadcast TV stations in Chicago
[35:52.360 --> 35:58.520]  broadcast TV stations in Los Angeles ready to carry it every night and I've
[35:58.520 --> 36:03.560]  just been tinkering with it and messing with it and trying to get it looking so
[36:03.560 --> 36:08.240]  good and perfect yet we're just going to go with it okay but last night was a
[36:08.240 --> 36:15.480]  really exciting beta test six hours live and no no teleprompters of course we
[36:15.480 --> 36:19.840]  have to put in a delay because after hours of makeup my eyes I did start
[36:19.840 --> 36:25.040]  dropping some s words and I apologize for that and that's why I left because I
[36:25.040 --> 36:30.200]  mean I get up at 6 30 in the morning it's 10 o'clock at night and look at
[36:30.200 --> 36:35.560]  these politicians Bravo Sierra is the only word sometimes I can use so there
[36:35.560 --> 36:39.800]  you go ladies and gentlemen so I give myself maybe a maybe an A- now but
[36:39.800 --> 36:45.800]  overall powerful transmission yesterday and we're gonna try to get all that
[36:45.800 --> 36:50.160]  uploaded well it is archived in tire six hours to prison planet dot TV will
[36:50.160 --> 36:53.080]  try to take some of the highlights of the election coverage it was a great
[36:53.080 --> 36:57.960]  analysis wasn't just the horse race look at the numbers and you know batching
[36:57.960 --> 37:00.880]  tea party the whole time no matter what broadcast it was because limbaugh's
[37:00.880 --> 37:04.840]  right I've never seen such a unification of state-run Democrat
[37:04.840 --> 37:08.560]  media and the Republican leadership to go after the tea party and say they're
[37:08.560 --> 37:13.000]  discredited they have no power they're bad they're evil they're racist when
[37:13.000 --> 37:17.560]  they're the people that caused this realignment it's the establishment now
[37:17.560 --> 37:21.520]  trying to make sure they can maintain control they're scared they're not
[37:21.520 --> 37:26.240]  invincible now I want to take your phone calls the toll-free number to talk
[37:26.240 --> 37:32.280]  about election 2014 the good the bad and the ugly it's all coming up I want to
[37:32.280 --> 37:35.880]  hear from first-time callers in the first few rounds then by the middle of the
[37:35.880 --> 37:41.600]  next hour it'll be open to everybody the toll-free number to join us is 800 259
[37:41.600 --> 37:51.720]  92 31 that's 800 259 92 31 and we'll get you up and on the air I want to run
[37:51.720 --> 37:58.280]  through though the good the bad the ugly mainly good there is some bad places
[37:58.280 --> 38:01.280]  like Washington state with Bill Gates funding it did Pastor Coney and gun
[38:01.280 --> 38:09.520]  control and Bloomberg's help I told you of course the governor got reelected in
[38:09.520 --> 38:16.480]  California and basically declared that California's a new Mexican state how
[38:16.480 --> 38:19.480]  many Mexican states are there like 10 or something maybe it's the 11th Mexican
[38:19.480 --> 38:23.720]  state or 12th Mexican state so it's not even a Mexican state it's the big drug
[38:23.720 --> 38:30.640]  cartel crime systems state but meanwhile of the gun control movement was
[38:30.640 --> 38:40.520]  routed almost everywhere else so a huge repudiation and a huge referendum on
[38:40.520 --> 38:45.360]  victim disarmament that's all coming up as well but I want to go to a report
[38:45.360 --> 38:51.840]  that John Bowne put together for last night's coverage dealing with you didn't
[38:51.840 --> 38:56.600]  build it and basically showing the fact that the United States was loved and
[38:56.600 --> 39:03.680]  admired from Japan to France from Germany to you'll Caribbean Islands the
[39:03.680 --> 39:09.880]  entire world from Russia to Prussia the whole world marveled at the United
[39:09.880 --> 39:15.640]  States because most the inventions most of the amazing art you name it came
[39:15.640 --> 39:23.600]  from here and we did build it the true immigrants the swashbucklers the trail
[39:23.600 --> 39:29.520]  blazers did build this country that's why the system demonizes it because it
[39:29.520 --> 39:36.080]  threatened the entire European system of monopoly of crony capitalism of letter
[39:36.080 --> 39:41.160]  of mark of licensure of centralized control Europe had been going through
[39:41.160 --> 39:46.600]  Renaissance for 500 years but still it was mainly a centralized system but the
[39:46.600 --> 39:52.640]  Renaissance flowered in North America and everything we've seen for 300 years
[39:52.640 --> 39:57.760]  even before the founding of this country has been a struggle to suppress
[39:57.760 --> 40:02.000]  innovation read the writings of George Washington what the war was really
[40:02.000 --> 40:07.280]  about that's why they demonize them so much here is John Bowne's report for
[40:07.280 --> 40:10.200]  info wars.com
[40:10.200 --> 40:24.760]  if you've been successful you don't you didn't get there on your own I'm
[40:24.760 --> 40:29.120]  always struck by people who think well it must be because I was just so smart
[40:29.120 --> 40:33.000]  there are a lot of smart people Benjamin Franklin invented thousands of things
[40:33.000 --> 40:38.280]  never leave till tomorrow which you can do today Benjamin Franklin it must be
[40:38.280 --> 40:41.240]  because I worked harder than everybody else let me tell you something they'll
[40:41.240 --> 40:45.200]  hold bunch of hard-working people out there
[40:46.800 --> 40:52.320]  all right Thomas there is no substitute for hard work Thomas Alva
[40:52.320 --> 41:00.480]  Edison if you were successful somebody along the line gave you some help there
[41:00.480 --> 41:06.000]  was a great teacher somewhere in your life most pilots learn when they pin on
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.920]  their wings and go out and get in a fighter especially that one thing you
[41:10.920 --> 41:15.200]  don't do you don't believe anything anybody tells you about an airplane
[41:15.200 --> 41:21.600]  Chuck Yeager. Somebody helped to create this unbelievable American system that we
[41:21.600 --> 41:25.600]  had that allowed you to thrive. Democracy is a pathetic belief in the
[41:25.600 --> 41:31.800]  collective wisdom of individual ignorance H.O. Meakin. If you got a business that you
[41:31.800 --> 41:37.160]  didn't build that somebody else made that happen. Nothing strengthens the
[41:37.160 --> 41:42.380]  judgment and quickens the conscience like individual responsibility. Elizabeth
[41:42.380 --> 41:51.000]  Katie Stanton. Don't let anybody tell you that you know it's corporations and
[41:51.000 --> 41:59.120]  businesses that create jobs you know that old theory trickle down economics
[41:59.120 --> 42:05.640]  that has been tried that has failed the internet didn't get invented on its own
[42:05.640 --> 42:11.800]  I took the initiative and creating the internet I took the initiative and
[42:11.800 --> 42:15.560]  moving forward a whole range of initiatives there's some things just
[42:15.560 --> 42:21.200]  like fighting fires we don't do on our own I mean imagine if everybody had their
[42:21.200 --> 42:27.800]  own fire service that'd be a hard way to organize fighting fires so we say to
[42:27.800 --> 42:31.720]  ourselves ever since the founding of this country you know what there's some
[42:31.720 --> 42:36.240]  things we do better together. The basic philosophy between the so-called
[42:36.240 --> 42:41.920]  extreme left people and communists and socialists and the so-called philosophy
[42:41.920 --> 42:46.680]  on the right of the fascists and the Nazis was really the same how can this
[42:46.680 --> 42:50.840]  be they're supposed to be opposites of each other and then I began to realize
[42:50.840 --> 42:56.160]  that there is something more common to all of these philosophies that was left
[42:56.160 --> 43:00.760]  out of my training in education and that was the ideology of collectivism
[43:00.760 --> 43:04.600]  began to realize that the thing that was common to them all is something called
[43:04.600 --> 43:09.760]  collectivism and that's a word that is not very well used it's not very
[43:09.760 --> 43:15.240]  entrenched in the vocabulary of most people today but I found out that it
[43:15.240 --> 43:20.320]  was a very commonly used word about a century ago people wrote a lot about
[43:20.320 --> 43:23.680]  collectivism and the opposite of that would be individualism those are two
[43:23.680 --> 43:29.800]  words that are sort of abandoned today but in my view I think they need to be
[43:29.800 --> 43:36.200]  recaptured and understood and used more. America is big enough to make room for
[43:36.200 --> 43:40.360]  many different kinds of thinking but many liberals have claimed to see
[43:40.360 --> 43:47.160]  virtues in socialism and communism which I for one have not been able to find.
[43:47.160 --> 43:52.560]  To promote their ideas American liberals have become a highly organized
[43:52.560 --> 43:57.600]  hardcore establishment in the United States and they have been excusing their
[43:57.600 --> 44:01.560]  appeasement and coddling of communism on the ground that they were being
[44:01.560 --> 44:08.120]  tolerant, broad-minded and working for peace. Remember always that you not only
[44:08.120 --> 44:13.240]  have the right to be an individual you have an obligation to be one. Eleanor
[44:13.240 --> 44:26.480]  Roosevelt of enemy propaganda rolling across the picket line lay down GI lay
[44:26.480 --> 44:31.160]  down GI we saw it all through the 20th century and now in the 21st century it's
[44:31.160 --> 44:34.840]  time to stand up and realize that we should not allow ourselves to be crammed
[44:34.840 --> 44:39.880]  into this rat maze we should not submit to dehumanization. I don't know about you
[44:39.880 --> 44:43.960]  but I'm concerned what's happening in this world. I'm concerned with destruction
[44:43.960 --> 44:48.160]  I'm concerned with the systems of control those that control my life and those
[44:48.160 --> 44:53.520]  that seek to control it even more. I want freedom that's what I want and that's what
[44:53.520 --> 44:57.600]  they should want. It's up to each and every one of us to turn this into some of the
[44:57.600 --> 45:02.320]  three the hatred the enemy and yes the insecurities because that is the central
[45:02.320 --> 45:07.400]  mode of control make us feel pathetic small so we'll willingly give up our
[45:07.400 --> 45:13.240]  sovereigns our liberty our destiny we have got to realize we're being conditioned
[45:13.240 --> 45:25.000]  on a mass scale. Start challenging this corporate slave state. The 21st century is going to be a new century. Not the century of slavery. Not the century of lies and issues we know together.
[45:25.000 --> 45:34.000]  Glasses and statism and all the rest of the modes of control. It's going to be the age of human time standing up for something pure and something right.
[45:34.000 --> 45:42.000]  We want what you call it. It's a little down there in the sun. It's all over the control. You can do sides of the same coin.
[45:46.000 --> 45:54.120]  And we'll get that video posted up to prisonplanet.com and infowars.com as soon as we can. We also did an amazing
[45:54.120 --> 45:58.280]  pro-second amendment piece last night that premiered during the six-hour expanded
[45:58.280 --> 46:02.800]  info wars nightly news. That'll be up in the next few hours on infowars.com and
[46:02.800 --> 46:06.880]  prisonplanet.com and remember if you're a radio listener out there it is
[46:06.880 --> 46:11.440]  essential it is key to tell your friends and family whether you listen on AMFM
[46:11.440 --> 46:15.920]  shortwave internet satellite how they can tune in that's how we reach more
[46:15.920 --> 46:22.080]  people. We're on the verge in the liberty movement of taking back the states
[46:22.080 --> 46:26.800]  taking back the counties and cities taking back the federal government and
[46:26.800 --> 46:30.840]  the entire establishment has their wagon circled against us. Your calls are coming
[46:30.840 --> 46:34.280]  up. Let's go through some of these headlines here. Republicans expand
[46:34.280 --> 46:42.320]  majority in the House of Representatives and get a huge added 12 seats on top of
[46:42.320 --> 46:50.480]  the seats that they already had so that's 12 on top of 234. They threw out a
[46:50.480 --> 46:55.800]  bunch of Democrats in Illinois. Every Democrat in the Congress in Arkansas
[46:55.800 --> 47:02.280]  thrown out that's not happened in 140 plus years. Democrats sink to the pre
[47:02.280 --> 47:07.040]  Great Depression levels in state legislatures probably the lowest ever in
[47:07.040 --> 47:13.440]  the original party of the United States. Democrats weakest since 1920s again
[47:13.440 --> 47:17.920]  just amazing how the candidates who Hillary Clinton campaign for do at the
[47:17.920 --> 47:23.160]  polls well the answer is they lost that's out of the daily caller just shows
[47:23.160 --> 47:27.760]  a total repudiation of her we're now hearing headlines where are seeing
[47:27.760 --> 47:32.400]  headlines where Obama era is over well he's meant to get his job done that's
[47:32.400 --> 47:36.680]  why he's gonna do what's unpopular open borders gun control by executive order
[47:36.680 --> 47:42.060]  you name it because it's foreign interest doing this we focus on the
[47:42.060 --> 47:46.120]  dumbed-down masses that support the establishment but they're just mindless
[47:46.120 --> 47:52.120]  victims of this ladies and gentlemen the real threat are the puppet controllers
[47:52.120 --> 47:57.920]  that pull the strings here's another zero hedge headline the economy so strong
[47:57.920 --> 48:01.780]  it just cost Obama the Senate that's what's really scary as I have a
[48:01.780 --> 48:06.840]  Bloomberg article we already knew this but it's when it's in Bloomberg that's
[48:06.840 --> 48:10.240]  when they start telling you what's gonna happen it means they want to cover
[48:10.240 --> 48:17.560]  their butt singer Elliott says us growth optimism unwarranted as data cooked
[48:17.560 --> 48:25.480]  top fund manager says the economy is quote totally fake deep crash coming
[48:25.480 --> 48:33.440]  totally fake deep crash coming we're not out of the woods by a long shot and I
[48:33.440 --> 48:37.680]  hope the establishment is concerned enough about what's going on to realize
[48:37.680 --> 48:41.880]  they better pull up or they're gonna wreck the whole system
[48:43.000 --> 48:47.440]  Rand Paul has come out and said Hillary Clinton has been soundly rejected this is
[48:47.440 --> 48:54.080]  a referendum on her that's out of the hill I agree with that statement Ron
[48:54.080 --> 48:57.440]  Paul's come out and said the two-party US political system in reality a
[48:57.440 --> 49:01.040]  monopoly that's what they're trying to maintain attacking the Tea Party it's
[49:01.040 --> 49:07.680]  just a challenger to that but if both the big parties don't get it together
[49:07.680 --> 49:10.920]  won't matter how many illegals they bring in for their new North American
[49:10.920 --> 49:16.200]  system they as a political class will be removed because Americans are used to
[49:16.200 --> 49:19.800]  prosperity and they're not going to put up with the fact that globalism is meant
[49:19.800 --> 49:24.120]  to make us poor Washington State approves expanded gun background checks
[49:24.120 --> 49:27.480]  bans gun shows basically requires background checks on all cells and
[49:27.480 --> 49:31.880]  transfers that's always done ahead of confiscation so that's some bad news
[49:31.880 --> 49:36.800]  there there is some good news second amendment crushes gun control candidates
[49:36.800 --> 49:42.280]  in midterm elections across the board except for California and Washington
[49:42.280 --> 49:49.000]  where the globalists have taken over continuing history's made Tim Scott
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.640]  becomes the South's first ever black man to enter the United States Senate by
[49:53.640 --> 50:00.240]  winning a public election as a Republican not a Democrat hard to
[50:00.240 --> 50:06.520]  believe there's never been a black senator amazing and now it's a
[50:06.520 --> 50:12.600]  Republican I guess they're gonna call that racist or calling my uncle Tom or
[50:12.600 --> 50:18.600]  something Johnny Ernest wins election first women to represent Iowa and U.S.
[50:18.600 --> 50:23.320]  Senate elected as a Republican they're not gonna like that are they see cuz
[50:23.320 --> 50:27.000]  they wanted to all be about race and religion not about lower taxes more
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.360]  freedom
[50:31.960 --> 50:36.200]  Eric Holder has released fast and furious documents that got him cited for
[50:36.200 --> 50:40.120]  corruption on election night hoping that that would be like doing you know
[50:40.120 --> 50:46.600]  what in the wind Greg Abbott steamrolls windy I love dead babies Davis in Texas
[50:46.600 --> 50:50.920]  governor's race that's certainly good news and there goes Rick Perry to run for

[54:49.200 --> 54:53.440]  have these globalist mega corporations that are creating a worldwide
[54:53.440 --> 54:59.000]  standardized cashless society removing state sovereignty national sovereignty
[54:59.000 --> 55:04.040]  into supernational globalist organizations in their own words to
[55:04.040 --> 55:09.080]  create a planetary corporate world government that is anti free market
[55:09.080 --> 55:16.280]  anti family eugenics based they want to continue the dog and pony show in the
[55:16.280 --> 55:20.760]  two and three party systems across the world indefinitely while setting up
[55:20.760 --> 55:25.520]  police states as a rearguard action to secure that the people could never get
[55:25.520 --> 55:32.200]  control of a state and bring them to justice it's like Hydra from Captain
[55:32.200 --> 55:36.760]  America it's a criminal mindset that feeds on different systems and we have
[55:36.760 --> 55:41.080]  to recognize that it's organized crime we're fighting and not let the big
[55:41.080 --> 55:45.640]  mega banks scapegoat capitalism and free market for all the horrors that are
[55:45.640 --> 55:50.000]  taking place and America has gotten six-year example of what
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.440]  collectivism does it creates poverty so there is a massive rejection of
[55:56.440 --> 56:00.280]  collectivism the problem is the establishment Republicans are still in
[56:00.280 --> 56:05.440]  control they're scared they're trying to block the libertarian patriot movement
[56:05.440 --> 56:11.720]  we have to fully support it promote it and jump on every new Republican
[56:11.720 --> 56:15.360]  governor who was elected every new legislator every new mayor not just
[56:15.360 --> 56:20.440]  federal every senator that just got elected every new house member hey you
[56:20.440 --> 56:29.400]  repeal Obamacare you repeal shutting down our clean cold plants you make

[56:35.760 --> 56:42.040]  level playing field for this country not a divide and conquer and we can do that
[56:42.040 --> 56:46.000]  but if we don't it's gonna be business as usual we have to scare them
[56:46.000 --> 56:52.760]  immediately and Mitch McConnell came out last night political headline we've
[56:52.760 --> 56:57.960]  got the video and he said we're not gonna repeal Obamacare and we're not
[56:57.960 --> 57:01.600]  going to shut down the government that means you're gonna continue with all

[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:56.600]  air hello Alex how are we this bright and cheerful day we're pretty good I
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:03:00.960]  mean this is overall good news but watching the sickening politicos that
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:07.240]  we just replaced one group with still makes my stomach turn I just want to I
[01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:11.960]  agree 100% with what you're saying because basically you are following what
[01:03:11.960 --> 01:03:22.480]  tarp dr. Tarpley stated in his last interview thing 100% I agree with but
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:27.520]  there's little bit of problem you're stating that the Democrats were within
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:34.520]  the slavery in the Ku Klux Klan I live 30 miles north of Pulaski Tennessee where
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:40.160]  the Ku Klux Klan started back in 65 when they switched to the civil rights
[01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:46.840]  movement all those guys went Republican well sure sure sure sure sure well I
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:52.680]  wouldn't say all a large portion flipped with the Southern strategy and but I
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:56.240]  mean it is the Republicans that did the Civil Rights Act it is the Republicans
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.960]  that ended slavery along with the abolitionist and so when we I mean
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.880]  Robert Byrd was a grand dragon and so yeah he hung up his grand dragon outfit
[01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.160]  and became it you know a liberal and and so I'm saying they just traded one
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:14.840]  type of racial politics for another type of racial politics he didn't change his
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:20.200]  thoughts I had a guy across the street because I'm a sweet from Chicago and I
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:25.080]  believe in equal rights he went out of his way to cause me problems for 12
[01:04:25.080 --> 01:04:29.040]  years I mean listen I've been in East Texas before working back when I was in
[01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:33.320]  high school and college during the summer on ranches and I'd have people you
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:37.800]  know Dairy Queen tell me get out of here you Yankee I mean that's just it's like
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:41.560]  games I mean that's just like you can have a black gang say get out of our
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:45.760]  neighborhood you have a white gang say we're in the clan get out of here that's
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.680]  just what losers do but I hear you I mean I don't want to sit there and I mean I
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.640]  was saying it's good that Republicans are electing a bunch of quote minorities
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.920]  because all I care about is the policies I don't care what color they are but
[01:04:57.920 --> 01:05:02.520]  that's what I was saying okay after consulting top doctors nutritionists

[01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:55.520]  gun grabbing of Obamacare of the open borders of the executive power grabs of
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:00.200]  our government funding of the Arab Spring and Isis and Al Qaeda it is the

[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:21.920]  repealing Obamacare that's at the state level or a hundred percent of newly
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:26.160]  elected GOP senators campaign at the federal level on repealing Obamacare
[01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:31.040]  but the bad news is Mitch McConnell has come out and said we're not gonna repeal
[01:09:31.040 --> 01:09:35.520]  it we might change some of it and we're not gonna have a government shutdown
[01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:39.480]  we're gonna pass a bunch of stuff it's this idea of we need to get stuff done
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:43.200]  no no government's gotten enough done you want to get something done start
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:46.800]  impeaching Obama you want to get something done start prosecuting Eric
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:51.960]  Holder you want to get something done turn our power plants back on cut our
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:58.480]  taxes but no Banner has said we're not repealing it because the very same
[01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:03.320]  donors that bankroll the Democrats bankroll the Republicans the Republicans
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:12.360]  helped write Obamacare so our problem is the new leader of the Senate our
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:20.280]  problem is the leader of the House and Congressman Walter Jones and others have
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:23.840]  been behind the scenes trying to get a movement going to unseat these creatures
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:29.880]  but they're up there telling us this is a referendum for establishment
[01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:33.480]  Republicans close quote when the establishment Republicans might as well
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:41.000]  be Democrats makes me want to vomit to see this unfolding it's also a major
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:46.680]  referendum when it comes to the first black senator elected black male
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:54.680]  senator very exciting things happening DC is stunned as Republicans claim a
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:59.080]  major major victory well I wouldn't call it Republicans I would call it a
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:04.880]  defeat of everything Obama has done Mia Love celebrates big victory in Utah I
[01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:10.960]  wasn't elected because of my color of my skin she was elected because she had
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:16.120]  libertarian conservative views and pledged to try to repeal what Obama's
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:26.200]  done Congress person elect Mia Love celebrated her surprise victory in Utah
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:30.600]  the first black Republican woman to be elected the House of Representatives but
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.360]  during an interview with CNN this morning love was quick to explain that she was
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:36.760]  not elected because of her race her gender I wasn't elected because of the
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:40.640]  color of my skin I was wasn't elected because of my gender she said interview
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.880]  I was elected because of the solutions that I put at the table because I
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:49.160]  promised I would run a positive issues oriented campaign and that's what
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:57.600]  resonated well she looks and acts like a nice sincere person and we'll see what
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:02.080]  ends up happening with her but this is a major political realignment the
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:05.920]  Democrats are the weakest in Congress in the House and Senate that they've been
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:11.720]  since the 1920s will we see a routing of Obama an investigation of him ordering
[01:12:11.720 --> 01:12:15.200]  the board of patrol to ship illegals in and give them vouchers and the big
[01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:19.960]  insurance companies involved and the big apartment complexes involved housing
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:24.200]  them and then giving them green cards will he get in trouble for his plan to
[01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:28.440]  bankrupt US energy will he get in trouble for his plan to sign more
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:32.960]  executive orders to go after guns you better believe that Mitch McConnell and
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:40.200]  John Boehner and others won't do jack squat and so government isn't scared
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:44.480]  criminals in government aren't scared of getting in trouble they don't feel
[01:12:44.480 --> 01:12:50.400]  accountable so yes this is a big repudiation but will it basically fall
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:55.000]  on dead ground will these seeds fall on the rocks and not sprout I want to take
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:02.320]  your calls on this again Obama has told ABC News that they will go for total
[01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:05.920]  honesty in December as a Christmas present using executive power they've
[01:13:05.920 --> 01:13:09.520]  already done it by fiat he's just going to certify it and claim it's an
[01:13:09.520 --> 01:13:14.400]  executive order to hand out the green cards California Jerry Brown wins
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:21.840]  record fourth term Americans face most dangerous two years 150 years excellent
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:25.360]  article that I agree with out of the Washington Times that America's on the
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:31.040]  verge of civil war look at this headline Washington Post battle for the Senate
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:36.960]  how the GOP did it by being establishment bull Limbaugh's right they would
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:42.520]  have had even bigger wins that embrace the Tea Party Obama aid has gone public
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:47.880]  saying he doesn't feel repudiated debacle for Obama as Republicans take
[01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:56.320]  control of the Congress GOP takeover they surge to control the Senate but now
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:14:03.400]  what will they do the real war now is the Republican leadership trying to stop
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:10.120]  anybody daring to unseat Boehner or McConnell in the House and the Senate
[01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:17.040]  other news George P. Bush elected in Texas Greg Abbott wins big in Texas
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:24.320]  crushing Wendy abortion Davis George P. Bush said he repudiated in Texas the
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:28.960]  establishment Republicans and was a Tea Partier meanwhile endorsed by his family
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:33.840]  I mean give me a break see how they play both sides to get elected but if George
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:37.840]  P. Bush actually doesn't act like his you know grandfather and people doesn't
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.720]  come after our guns and you know whatever you can't blame people for the sins of
[01:14:41.720 --> 01:14:50.280]  the fathers Governor D old defeats Democrat Jason Carter of course of the
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:57.000]  Carter family to win second term food votes GMO labeling rejected in Colorado
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:04.400]  probably Oregon Berkeley votes for soda taxes yeah let's tax sodas but not ban
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:10.320]  you know not allowing GMO labeling so that's just some of the news I'm gonna
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:14.360]  go to your phone calls now we're gonna go to Ludin in Israel and we're gonna go
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:19.320]  to Daryl Richard Mike Angela we're gonna go to everybody right now Ludin in
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:24.000]  Israel what's your take on the election here well Shalom from Jerusalem Alex
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:30.240]  welcome well we like to thank all the American voters who are basically are
[01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:35.360]  standing up against his Barack Hussein Obama as you know his Middle East policy
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:41.960]  is a disaster I continue support Hamas and Fattah here in Israel and today we
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:47.480]  had a terror attack where one died and many injured due to these so called
[01:15:47.480 --> 01:15:52.400]  peace false negotiations as I call them Obama needs to wake up and smell the
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:56.600]  coffee and he still he needs to leave the White House at once immediately he
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:00.520]  needs to be impeached because he has done nothing for the country but just
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:05.360]  spend spend spend and give money to his big party that's all he's done and
[01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:10.200]  especially with the treatment that he has given to our prime minister Benjamin
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:16.360]  Netanyahu and it is time for us as Jews to basically come back and be
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:21.880]  Republicans and stand for what we believe in well I mean I'll say this I
[01:16:21.880 --> 01:16:26.040]  used to hear that Obama was secretly a radical Muslim and didn't believe it but
[01:16:26.040 --> 01:16:30.280]  then Odinga his cousin and others got caught even in the Egyptian courts with
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:34.400]  the documents shipping in hundreds a million out of Kenya you saw you saw
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:39.920]  the Kenyan mall attack into Egypt to overthrow the government and put
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:45.160]  radicals in and then overthrowing Qaddafi and putting al-Qaeda in trying to
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:50.560]  overthrow Syria to put radicals in trying to overthrow Iraq funding ISIS but
[01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:54.000]  then you pull back and over two hundred million dollars a year by the State
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:01.240]  Department is being sent to Hamas why would the Democrats want to
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:08.080]  destabilize the Middle East and fund Hamas it's just it's crazy why would
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:13.960]  they order try to order the cities and counties to not arrest illegals that have
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:16.880]  committed felonies and then why would they want to legalize felons which
[01:17:16.880 --> 01:17:20.960]  they're doing on record why would you want to say if you can get here from
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:25.880]  anywhere in the world and you're a felon a robber a rapist an arsonist we want
[01:17:25.880 --> 01:17:30.960]  to legalize you that is the most bizarre behavior I mean because I've never
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:36.440]  been a partisan person but the Democrats do appear to be completely mentally ill
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:44.360]  let me tell you something Hamas has fired over 15,000 rockets into Israel and the
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:50.720]  Barack Hussein Obama administration has been quiet all along just not long ago a
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:55.680]  few months ago we had a war where they fired over 500 rockets in a span of 40
[01:17:55.680 --> 01:18:01.640]  to 50 days and the Obama administration kept quiet in all this and they kept
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:07.160]  on carry to so-called try and diffuse the situation but they know that Hamas
[01:18:07.160 --> 01:18:13.280]  once told destruction of Israel Barack Hussein Obama was a a known support of
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:19.360]  Mohammed Morsi who was a a the president of the Muslim Brotherhood he was
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:25.640]  supporting the Muslim Brotherhood who is an offshoot of Hamas I know I mean it
[01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:29.040]  was and it's crazy I'm gonna jump another caller but clearly it's part of a
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.120]  larger destabilization program worldwide it's reckless it's insane
[01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:36.640]  regardless of what side you're on Israel's not going anywhere they have
[01:18:36.640 --> 01:18:42.640]  nuclear weapons and it's just a mess let's talk to Angela in Texas thanks
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:45.560]  for holding her on the air
[01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:53.040]  hello yep go ahead I'm so sorry yeah I just wanted to comment on the election I
[01:18:53.040 --> 01:18:58.440]  definitely would have rather seen libertarian you know take over everything
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:03.200]  but of course that's kind of like maybe a far-off goal I would say it's mostly a
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:08.920]  plus but I do think that moving forward if the Republicans or at least those
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:12.960]  tea party elements of the Republican Party do not reach out to minorities I'm
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:18.880]  a minority myself I'm a black American and if you don't I think that for the
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:23.080]  most part the Democrats were it has been able to brainwash and control the
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:27.680]  minority vote because they at least acknowledge them even though it's a
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:32.800]  complete and a completely corrupt man or the Republicans need to like hold on
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.040]  I want to hear more from you so stay there Angela thanks for calling and I
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:41.280]  want to let you finish your thoughts then we'll go to Darrell and we'll go to
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:45.400]  Mike and Richard and Robert and many others but that's totally true there's
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:49.240]  been such a monopoly on the minorities with the Democrats Republicans just
[01:19:49.240 --> 01:19:55.480]  basically accepted that to their own peril and so I agree with you we need to
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:59.040]  reach out to everybody with the ideas of free market freedom I'm gonna come back

[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:26.480]  here back live we see a massive political realignment by the Tea Party in
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:31.800]  the Republican Party propelling them to victory with the rhetoric that exposed
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:36.200]  how criminal the Democrats are when the Republican leadership wouldn't criticize
[01:24:36.200 --> 01:24:42.080]  and profess inferiors for IRS gate for Obamacare for open borders they're
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.800]  involved in almost all of that because they're run by the very same globalist
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:52.000]  the very same special interest and so now this happens and they go this is a
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:57.520]  referendum against the Tea Party and against Obama and we can now do whatever
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:06.760]  we want no we want Obamacare repealed we want the gun grabbing to stop we want
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:12.120]  the trees in to stop and Mitch McConnell's and Banner's answer is we're not
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:16.120]  gonna repeat a low Obamacare so they tell the junior senators and house
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:20.720]  members sit down and shut up but you're not junior as they call you in the
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:27.880]  committee system you're elected just like anybody else just as important and a
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:31.800]  tip to house and Senate members you want to rise like a Rand Paul or a Ted Cruz
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:36.720]  nobody calls them junior anymore or implies they don't matter they're
[01:25:36.720 --> 01:25:42.200]  prominent because they're hardcore not because they start waffling and Rand
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:49.840]  Paul needs to stay the course okay Angela in Texas go ahead give us your
[01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:55.360]  take on the situation oh yes sir I totally agree with you and I think what
[01:25:55.360 --> 01:25:59.400]  the point I was making was the neglect of the Republican Party towards
[01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:04.560]  minorities and I think that yeah of course the Republicans are you know
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:08.000]  they're trying to spend it as this is a repudiation of the Tea Party and the
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:11.880]  Democrats so that they can you know remain in power but I think that we
[01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:14.920]  should nourish the Tea Party while it's aligned with the Republican Party I'm
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:20.360]  gonna get strong enough break away and another point and yeah like you said
[01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:25.920]  being more radical is what people are responding to so the Tea Party elements
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:30.960]  in reaching out to minorities you know for instance they're mostly you know
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:35.920]  against abortion or against government handouts well why not point out one and
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:39.680]  two black babies are aborted I mean it's very easy things that I think that the
[01:26:39.680 --> 01:26:45.760]  black community or even the Mexican community you can also get a little
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:52.480]  nervous on the radio but also pointing out how this inflex of illiterate and I
[01:26:52.480 --> 01:26:56.520]  mean nothing against them it's human beings but this cheap labor coming in is
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:27:01.000]  actually going to hurt minorities all you know it's going to drive you it's
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:05.280]  going to hurt poor people and it's gonna drive down the wages to the point it
[01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:09.160]  won't even help third-world people anymore and America won't be a place to
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:16.000]  run to and I I think it's very positive that so many quote minority men and
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.600]  women at the state and federal levels just got elected in fact more new
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:24.480]  minorities got elected as Republicans as they did this time as Democrats I think
[01:27:24.480 --> 01:27:29.600]  that's a very healthy sign very exciting God bless you I appreciate your
[01:27:29.600 --> 01:27:34.720]  call Mike in Florida you're on the air thanks for calling hi Alex how are you
[01:27:34.720 --> 01:27:39.440]  good long-time listener first-time caller I just wanted to talk about the
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:45.280]  hypocrisy of the Florida election sure basically basically what we had is
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:49.400]  amendment to I don't know if you're familiar with that it's the bill to
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:54.800]  legalize medical marijuana and when that failed that failed in Florida it
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:59.680]  failed and it failed by just a little bit it was 58% of the vote and it
[01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:04.760]  requires 60% majority and what I did a little research into it and what I found
[01:28:04.760 --> 01:28:09.080]  is that back in 2006 they had an amendment called amendment three and
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:14.920]  that is the amendment that made it a super majority and let's see it only
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:20.480]  required at that point it only required 50% of the votes passed so they made the
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:27.000]  super majority amendment and they did it with 57% of the votes well you know
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:32.440]  that the big casino owner out of New Jersey Sheldon Anderson who's involved
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:38.880]  in all sorts of shady things Adelson is behind the Florida anti-pot campaign he
[01:28:38.880 --> 01:28:44.160]  spent 85% of the money spent on that was by him and it's always these casino
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:48.920]  gangster types connected to private prison industries that want to keep drugs
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:55.400]  illegal now gee why is it always the big dons the big capos that are anti free
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:02.000]  speech anti-gun and pro drug war because they want to continue to keep the
[01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:06.320]  whole game running and a lot of drug dealers out there want to keep drugs
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:10.000]  illegal why because it keeps the price up it's not that I like the drug culture
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:16.040]  but keeping drugs illegal just like 10 years of alcohol prohibition in the
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:23.840]  20s on record you can look up the numbers triple the alcoholism triple the bad
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:28.880]  alcohol poisoning and it more than triple organized crime and corrupt the
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:33.720]  police well prohibition ends they suddenly make narcotics illegal you
[01:29:33.720 --> 01:29:37.840]  could buy at the drugstore you could go in the store and have them mix you a
[01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:43.200]  soft drink at the counter with cocaine in it or heroin and it was much less
[01:29:43.200 --> 01:29:48.480]  used in because everybody knew you know losers did lob them we'll be right back

[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:20.560]  the alex jones show because there is a war on for your mind the public is getting wise
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:27.560]  to how the scams work and it's happening all over the world the pentagon in multiple public papers admits that's why they're gearing up northbound
[01:33:50.560 --> 01:33:57.560]  for war with the tea party war with the veterans war with the gun owners because the plan is to bring in enough illegals to checkmate every state and to pass laws that are unconstitutional to confiscate guns, force conscription, restrictions on what religion you can practice. Houston's trying to arrest preachers that read out of the old testament this is really going on we know what they've done in other parts of the world.
[01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:35.560]  I would have expected all of them to be thrown out I would have expected Obama to be impeached so yeah we can celebrate that there was somewhat of a big realignment but now day one not even before election night was over mitch mcconnellton
[01:34:50.560 --> 01:34:57.560]  and bainer the republican leaders all strutting around like peacocks are saying hey we're going after the tea party with our donors and we're going to work with the democrats and we're going to be conciliatory and we're not going to impeach Obama so you just sit down and shut up and now you see the democrats with the republican leadership circling the wagons against the americans
[01:35:21.560 --> 01:35:44.560]  while the pentagon treasonously trains for military occupation of america against returning veterans and gun owners the only good news in that silver lining in that cloud that big cloud that storm cloud is that the last six years of training the military for gun confiscation and training them the founding fathers are bad and training them that freedom is bad is that it woke the military completely up
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:36:04.560]  but will people go back to sleep now that obama's a lame duck and oh we won so let him have his executive orders oh we can impeach him oh we can't block his executive orders because they want to shut down the power plants because they want to open the borders up because they want to continue obama care written by the big insurance companies and banks
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:13.560]  they want to continue business as usual on and on and on and on and on and on
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:42.560]  that's the plan that's the goal and i know you know that but we need to get those points out there i'll tell you though when i tune into other libertarian conservative talk radio and they're saying exactly what i'm saying it's exciting that in the past five six seven years they tune in here what we're saying and then say the day later or a week later the real power of this broadcast is we're affecting the entire narrative even a CNN MSNBC and time magazine have said that clearly it starts on this show and then ends up everywhere else
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:37:11.560]  it doesn't even start here anymore in many cases and i love that i want to make myself obsolete people now get the paradigm they get how it really works and so we have had such a massive effect in paradigm shifting that now i'm hearing him talk about population reduction and why the democrats and the liberals are really fascist and and and and totalitarians
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:20.560]  but it's not that they're just adopting my world view people are researching what the real source documents show
[01:37:20.560 --> 01:37:28.560]  they're researching what's going on in the actual documentation
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:32.560]  and that's what's exciting
[01:37:32.560 --> 01:37:55.560]  once people pull back the curtain once they get outside the box once the genies out of the bottle once the train leaves the station once people pull back and go what global unelected governance with a world tax tracking everything we do and setting taxes so high you can't afford to have kids and you can't even have a car and you're totally poor and they're telling the third world they can't even have a shack
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:10.560]  to politically control us we're not going to go along with this i got some special reports i want to get to and a lot of other breaking news that's up on info wars dot com but right now
[01:38:10.560 --> 01:38:16.560]  i want to go right back to the phone calls richard in florida you're on the air
[01:38:16.560 --> 01:38:29.560]  hey how you doing alex good brother hey listen i you know i i can't help but be skeptical about the whole thing about bobby uh republicans taking over and everything the people have spoken but
[01:38:29.560 --> 01:38:37.560]  the real i mean it'll come out when they listen to it and do it we ask the reason they were voted in is because we want them to do something
[01:38:37.560 --> 01:38:43.560]  not just to get them in there and feel good that we got republicans in there we need them to actually take action and do something
[01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:51.560]  with you and look we always focus on the federal level it's been pretty much captured by the globalist that's why no matter what we do they won't ever do the right thing
[01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:59.560]  but at the state and county and city level it's too complex for them to have full control and that's where the real gains are happening
[01:38:59.560 --> 01:39:09.560]  they are so scared of what ron paul did then ran paul then dead cruise now this sweep they can see the exponential growth
[01:39:09.560 --> 01:39:19.560]  so i'm i'm simply saying we're in the game we have a chance to turn the tide but we need maximum effort by everybody folks can't now celebrate that
[01:39:19.560 --> 01:39:29.560]  oh we repudiated obama notice he says he doesn't feel repudiated he's coming with the executive orders so we need to hammer mitch mcconnell and hammer john bainer
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:40.560]  not just with phone calls and emails but banner hangs and trips to their offices and trips to their offices you know in kentucky and other areas and we need to call in on talk radio about them
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:50.560]  and we need to put pressure on them and we need to put pressure on the other members of the house and senate to unseat them in the seniority leadership since when is it seniority
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:40:00.560]  and then you have a limited group they vote for no no why don't we have walter jones as a speaker of the house why don't we have justin amash as a speaker of the house
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:12.560]  why don't we have senator cruise or senator paul as the leader of the senate we don't want more stale establishment guys that have been up there 30 40 years
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:25.560]  that were for the banker bailouts and were for obama care and won't repeal it now i'm trying not to get angry but i can't i hate banner and mitch mcconnell more than i do obama
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:36.560]  at least obama is an open criminal at least he funds the muslim brotherhood publicly at least he opens the borders up publicly at least he comes after our guns publicly at least he pushes obama care publicly
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:51.560]  these republican blue blood pieces of garbage sometimes get mad they sit up there in their fancy little suits with all their little minions around them telling us how this
[01:40:51.560 --> 01:40:57.560]  this certifies republican establishment in all their g.o.p. crap
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:11.560]  i mean they make me want to throw up just like all these fake democrats praying on minorities do they know what they're doing they know they're selling the country out they know they're trying to shut down the jobs
[01:41:11.560 --> 01:41:19.560]  they're involved in cloward and piven just as much as the democrats are it was a republican george h.w. bush that got us signed on
[01:41:19.560 --> 01:41:31.560]  executively they didn't pass it in congress to the agenda 21 and now we're living under something that never even passed just like congress five years ago wouldn't pass
[01:41:31.560 --> 01:41:41.560]  carbon taxes obama just went ahead with it passed on in your energy prices energies up almost double in this country when it comes to electrical power and stuff
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:51.560]  i mean look at your power bills they want to hurt us they're bad people harry reid is a bad man john mccain
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:42:01.560]  now the head of the arm services committee that's a bad thing that came out of this the democrat he's replacing it wasn't even as bad as he is i mean
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:11.560]  does anyone really believe john mccain's getting elected does anyone buy the guy that hangs out with al-qaeda i'm sorry caller thank you for the call
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:19.560]  who's up next year i just got really angry i just can't get angry like that anymore
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:28.560]  people say oh we love it when you get angry get angry more no i don't need to get angry more okay i need to focus on the news build a news organization to fight these people
[01:42:28.560 --> 01:42:40.560]  but it's not one tenth of what we need what happened yesterday yes i'm happy but it's out do you understand they ship in unlimited illegals from all over the world
[01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:51.560]  and give them free plane tickets or bus tickets and then ship them to section eight housing at nice apartment complexes swimming pools workout gyms you name it and sign them up on welfare
[01:42:51.560 --> 01:43:03.560]  and give them voter ids i mean i was i was told this seven eight years ago by a major manager a family friend and they were sworn to secrecy and to sign nondisclosures
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:12.560]  and they said you throw out citizens for anything you let illegal state 10 to a one bedroom if we want you understand that's an order
[01:43:12.560 --> 01:43:19.560]  and then the head of her company is the guy that got blown up in his car in west texas remember all that probably stages death
[01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:23.560]  it's the biggest apartment chain in the country
[01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:32.560]  and then now callers calling saying yeah there's all these nigerians here and the feds are here and the whole complex has been taken over and they're training them and giving them documents i mean yeah
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:41.560]  it's an organized crime government you understand it isn't just obama it isn't going away
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:49.560]  but it could if we don't see john bainer and people like mcconnell we could save this country
[01:43:49.560 --> 01:43:55.560]  let me explain something it's easy to wreck something and then salvage it and cut it in pieces calling yourself a hero
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:44:01.560]  that's what the globalists do they wreck companies and take them over and sell them off they wreck countries
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:06.560]  you ever seen wall street the first one really good movie based on a lot of you know things that have really happened
[01:44:06.560 --> 01:44:13.560]  it's not a true story but it's based on a lot of things that did happen where they come into a perfectly good company that's making money and doing great
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:20.560]  but they'd rather loot the pensions they'd rather take it over they'd rather shell it off and have a profit for the executives that take it over right there
[01:44:20.560 --> 01:44:29.560]  america is under a hostile globalist takeover and i am not their slave i'm not here to be used as a doormat
[01:44:29.560 --> 01:44:37.560]  i'm not here to be lectured that i can't have a car air conditioning while obama lives like a emperor of earth
[01:44:37.560 --> 01:44:45.560]  i take offense at him telling africans they can't have anything or they can only come here and get it from me
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:49.560]  oh man i'm angry robert and georgia you're on the air go ahead
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:58.560]  thanks for taking my call alex um first off uh you're you're obama a bullet shirt for a huge hit at the uh at the whole line yesterday just want to let you know about that
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:07.560]  oh good yeah we're almost sold out of the blood spatter ones and the other ones the obama obola shirts uh you know collectivism as a disease in forstore.com
[01:45:07.560 --> 01:45:14.560]  what did folks think of those oh man the reaction was great people love them uh at least at least in the part of atlanta where i'm at i want to let you know
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:23.560]  um just just with the hollywood land from here to atlanta it's only a matter of time before the liberal state over atlanta it becomes the la of the south
[01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:30.560]  we do you ever thought about setting up a satellite operation we should be out here in my public one team but uh
[01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:38.560]  well that's what that's what collectivist locust parasites do they wreck a beautiful place like california and they move on to austin or atlanta
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:45.560]  and and and they will wreck it and they will waddle around and tell you what to do because they're authoritarian scumbag idiots
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:54.560]  michelle michelle none and uh jason carter i mean they they had a lot of traction out here just a lot of liberals that came out here from hollywood so the first in the pudding right there
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:46:03.560]  um but yeah we we'd love to have you out here man we we need you on the airways desperately so uh but question for you um about ebola um
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:10.560]  you know what are your thoughts about what's going on with ebola and it's completely not even being reported on the news on any of the news outlets right now
[01:46:10.560 --> 01:46:16.560]  and what do you think is going to come out well you know we don't know we know that suddenly health care workers are being brought in it was spreading
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:24.560]  and then they said nothing's happening we confirmed with top doctors that they are disappearing people and i believe that there is some ebola spreading in the us
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:31.560]  and that they're covering it up we know they're covering it up um we know they're whisking people away we know the controlled media won't cover it
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:39.560]  we've done our best so we're just gonna sit here and watch and wait and see what happens uh and i'm glad you brought that up because i'm we were just talking about it during the last break
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:47.560]  about the consensus around here is it's spreading hopefully not too bad they're covering it up so they can try to keep the borders wide open
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:54.560]  so i don't know i appreciate your call robert scott in washington elections 2014 a realignment or more of the same
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:47:12.560]  well yeah i am calling from former region 10 female region 10 and i wanted to talk a little specifically about the gun measure that supposedly passed up here and um and this is part of the problem up here is that if you want real
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:24.560]  news or something people are so disenfranchised that there really is not a network that you can get it but it's very interesting and i don't know if people know this if it's made national news
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:36.560]  but uh i think about maybe a week or so maybe a couple of weeks before that uh midterm there there was a local school shooting up here it was this north of seattle
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:49.560]  and from some of this information that i've been kind of getting it just some of it just seemed very suspect it just also seemed pretty much maybe like it might have been a false flag or something
[01:47:49.560 --> 01:48:02.560]  i don't know and then well here's the deal bill gates runs washington uh warren buffett gave money as well they're part of the same foundation so did uh bloomberg to come in there and try to basically register everybody's guns they can confiscate them
[01:48:02.560 --> 01:48:13.560]  and so that's what's happening i hear you a very suspect but everywhere else the gun grabbers got unseated so overall very positive news jerry in california you're on the year
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.560]  hey alex how are you doing good brother what do you think about election 2014
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:35.560]  more of the same i'm afraid unless they do something in arizona in kentucky i'm just wondering i haven't really seen any in depth articles by any of your reporters on the people in arizona in kentucky and why would they keep electing these neocon globalist i don't understand
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:39.560]  there most of the people i know from those states are pretty intelligent
[01:48:39.560 --> 01:48:48.560]  i think there's clear election fraud in and it's been proven in kentucky at some levels and also there in arizona
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:57.560]  i mean i've seen the polls time and time again every six years where john mccain's behind and then the week of the election oh he's you know neck and neck and then he wins
[01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:09.560]  i mean who really believes that that's happening now there is a lot of the public that's still dumbed down and tens of millions of dollars get spent on these races so is it the victory of propaganda or the victory of electronic voting machines
[01:49:09.560 --> 01:49:22.560]  it's like senator hagel now defense secretary 90 plus percent in his first election when he got elected back in the early nineties to the senate 90 percent of his money
[01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:33.560]  you know went into a tv ads but then over 90 percent the same time of the ballots were cast on machines that he owned the company
[01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:38.560]  so again he's spending money with the media so they don't basically report on that
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:46.560]  that's the ties to the media to play along with it and then meanwhile very questionable election that got chuck hagel into power
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:50.560]  that information why don't those people know that information
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:59.560]  well this is why complex civilizations are so fragile and tend to break down because corruption can hide in the complexity
[01:49:59.560 --> 01:50:08.560]  and i think that's what it comes down to is people are working hard that's why they want us poor so that we're so busy trying to feed ourselves and pay the taxes
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:14.560]  that we don't have time to go out and get informed or go out and demonstrate or go out and do a talk show you see
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:23.560]  but when i talk to these people and i have a lot of business that i do in arizona they're completely unaware of any of this
[01:50:23.560 --> 01:50:30.560]  they just look at you basically with a blank stare and that may be because a lot of those people there are from out of state
[01:50:30.560 --> 01:50:36.560]  there's a lot of californians have moved to arizona but they are literally oblivious to the politics there
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:48.560]  that mccain i swear to god that with a great sheriff like arpaio in arizona it's just amazing to me that mccain can continue to get reelected
[01:50:48.560 --> 01:50:56.560]  i was going to also tell you my grandmother was a jones came over on a wagon train down into texas big town of crally

[01:54:06.560 --> 01:54:25.560]  I gotta say I've done a pretty good job of taking phone calls but in the third hour I'm gonna hear a couple of special reports we've got get into some of the geopolitical and economic news
[01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:38.560]  and take even more phone calls but no matter how good the call is I've got to shut up and go to the next person if we're gonna get you all on air it's longtime callers first time callers people that agree disagree questions comments
[01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:48.560]  any topic free for all in the next hour though I imagine you want to keep talking about the election this is a big repudiation of Obama
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:55:01.560]  but the establishment expected that he's not there to be a hero in the end he's there to con you as long as you can get the agenda through the globalist the same program worldwide
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:12.560]  the difference is they want to manage things through the controlled republicans if we can take over the republican party it's game over if we could take over the democrats it'd be game over
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:23.560]  I don't care what party it is as long as they don't try to run the country off the edge of a cliff and let me tell you when you shut down half the power plants that supply half the power in the country
[01:55:23.560 --> 01:55:32.560]  they've already shut half of them down and they supply 50 plus percent now they supply us something like 30 percent
[01:55:32.560 --> 01:55:42.560]  that right there is an act of war that's what you bomb when you're taking a country over in World War two do you know what our bombers mainly targeted power plants
[01:55:42.560 --> 01:55:57.560]  because then there won't be power at a factory to run it you understand it's a military attack that isn't rhetoric you've heard former top FBI CIA on the broadcast you've heard former head of the board patrol on
[01:55:57.560 --> 01:56:09.560]  former head of their union on saying this is asymmetrical warfare this is the takedown of the country these are officers military trained they know what they're seeing it is an attack
[01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:16.560]  no debate just like if Godzilla came out and attacked Tokyo that's an attack if you attack the power plant he didn't real the new world order is real
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:30.560]  you see that movie Pacific Rim where the kajus come out and attack the cities kajus aren't real folks the new world order is now I've talked about this a lot but why do you think they want you bankrupt
[01:56:30.560 --> 01:56:43.560]  because they want you to give up they can't compete with free markets so they want to blow the engine it's so elementary they've all written books describing why they're doing it it's not my opinion
[01:56:43.560 --> 01:56:57.560]  we're going to go to Hanna and we're going to go to Patrick and Ray and Steven and Jason and many others toll free number design is 800-25-99231
[01:56:57.560 --> 01:57:06.560]  coming up I mentioned this but I want to read this article the reason this is scary is we're seeing this out of Bill Gates we're hearing it out of
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:19.560]  Singer Elliott we're hearing it out of Donald Trump oh there's going to be a total collapse and when you start hearing the establishment guys say that it could be a right around the corner
[01:57:19.560 --> 01:57:33.560]  we've seen a slow economic slide that's been bad enough but a big collapse or a Ebola starts to spread if that cover up that appears to be going on unravels who knows you've already seen how everything's accelerating and getting crazy
[01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:40.560]  this is only the beginning but we're seeing good things happen like folks waking up and repudiating Obama
[01:57:40.560 --> 01:57:49.560]  there's not just evil in the universe there's good in the universe as well but good people tend to think they have no power so they hand the world over to evil that's what I'm getting at
[01:57:49.560 --> 01:58:05.560]  now before I go any further we are Lister supported and we sell things like the new long sleeve modern camouflage digital camouflage Molan Labe come and take it info wars dot com shirt that is so handsome

[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:49.560]  Tony Ernst the first elected female senator out of Iowa I don't know enough about all these senators yet I'm trying to track him but certainly better than Obama's people I know that but she made the statement about let's make them squeal like it's oh let's just torture the Democrats let's beat them
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:59.560]  let's have power over him no let's talk to him like their victims have been kind let's talk to him about how collectivism screws them over let's talk to him
[02:00:59.560 --> 02:01:15.560]  see a lot of people like to just make fun of another political party or or or I won you lost Democrats did that when Obama got in and I was even supporting Mitt Romney or John McCain
[02:01:15.560 --> 02:01:25.560]  and they do stuff like that you need to say listen I'm not in your paradigm okay this is a manipulated system and socialism doesn't work except for the elite
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:36.560]  let's play that clip where she says let's make them squeal thanks to all of you we are heading to Washington
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:56.560]  we are going to make them squeal I'm gonna be honest with you she makes my skin crawl I mean she comes off like a classic model steppard wife or something I mean
[02:01:56.560 --> 02:02:06.560]  I'm sick of going to Republican functions to cover them over the years and every woman looks like that and talks like that and it's so fake and it's okay to be nice and cheerleaderly and I get all of it
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:17.560]  but man we're in a war here okay I don't want to make the Democrats squeal I want to expose their leadership as criminals and I want to see them prosecuted and thrown in jail
[02:02:17.560 --> 02:02:32.560]  and put the liberty movement in jail for no reason I mean this is war this isn't fine and that's why we continue to lose this country is this isn't a game ladies and gentlemen
[02:02:32.560 --> 02:02:43.560]  the average Democrat is a dumb down victim with a low IQ brought up in a project so we're fed GMO their whole life and in fluoride
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:58.560]  they're going to make them squeal you're going to be up there in the Senate behind closed doors of these Democrats doing deals because your special interests that fly you around on junkets together are going to be telling you they can get you a good business deal for your husband or your son or your daughter if you play ball
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:07.560]  so I don't want to hear about making Democrats squeal I want to hear about turning this country around and not going to hell in a handbasket let me tell you something
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:15.560]  I want to understand to have a controlled collapse in this country and a global great depression that on the ashes of which they're going to destroy the nation state and freedom and bring in collectivist tyranny
[02:03:15.560 --> 02:03:28.560]  do you understand that's the end of your golf courses and the end of all your trending around you liberals and Republicans and all you people need to be slapped upside the head in a sociological way
[02:03:28.560 --> 02:03:41.560]  because the hardcore scientific globalists running this when they're done nothing's going to look the way it looks okay this is an end of days type scenario and I don't mean that from a biblical perspective
[02:03:41.560 --> 02:03:49.560]  the new world order top technicians that run things that are trying to steer things and we're in a battle with them they're not in complete control
[02:03:49.560 --> 02:04:01.560]  the technocrats that decide where the power grids go in and what country gets what industry the global managers want to set up a planetary robot computer surveilled system
[02:04:01.560 --> 02:04:12.560]  that makes humans obsolete because they believe we're obsolete and plan to kill at least 90% of us now I'm going to say that again to all of you establishment types out there
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:22.560]  the Pentagon doesn't laugh at me anybody that's been in special operations in real black ops doesn't laugh historians don't laugh
[02:04:22.560 --> 02:04:32.560]  people that write the anti-terrorism laws in this country don't laugh the top lawyers don't laugh the top hackers don't laugh the top scientists don't laugh the top medical doctors don't laugh

[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:25.560]  many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients

[02:08:30.560 --> 02:08:34.560]  others being in root for the western dream
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:42.560]  if you are receiving this transmission live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:44.560]  you are the resistance
[02:08:44.560 --> 02:08:47.560]  it's Alex Jones
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:53.560]  one last breath before when blows better raise your ears
[02:08:53.560 --> 02:08:56.560]  the sound of hooves knock at your door

[02:09:01.560 --> 02:09:03.560]  the sound of hooves knock at your door
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:10.560]  do they ride to destroy collectivism
[02:09:10.560 --> 02:09:14.560]  or do they ride to destroy liberty and individualism
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:16.560]  and love of God
[02:09:16.560 --> 02:09:18.560]  and love of justice
[02:09:18.560 --> 02:09:20.560]  well, we make that decision
[02:09:20.560 --> 02:09:22.560]  if we just lay down, they will take over
[02:09:22.560 --> 02:09:25.560]  it's good that America is starting to wake up
[02:09:25.560 --> 02:09:28.560]  I'd give us a B plus on this election
[02:09:28.560 --> 02:09:32.560]  but as outrageous as the Democrats have been
[02:09:32.560 --> 02:09:35.560]  it shows that the elite want this agenda of shutting America down
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:37.560]  shipping our jobs overseas
[02:09:37.560 --> 02:09:39.560]  bankrupting us, opening our borders
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:42.560]  letting the presidency become dictatorial
[02:09:42.560 --> 02:09:46.560]  I mean, can you imagine some Republican like George W. Bush with dictatorial powers
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:48.560]  Obama has had?
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:50.560]  see, the presidency is degenerating
[02:09:50.560 --> 02:09:52.560]  especially since Clinton
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:56.560]  because they can just get away with anything and everything
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:00.560]  this is our march into a third world status
[02:10:00.560 --> 02:10:03.560]  and you see this degeneration all over the world

[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:14.560]  there's a video
[02:10:14.560 --> 02:10:16.560]  Freedom Grows Out of the Barrel of a Gun
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:19.560]  I think it's one of the best gun shoots we've done
[02:10:19.560 --> 02:10:21.560]  because there's a lot of political information
[02:10:21.560 --> 02:10:23.560]  and pro-gun info in it
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:28.560]  dealing with Joe Biden saying women shouldn't be able to own 223M4s
[02:10:28.560 --> 02:10:30.560]  and it just went up a few minutes ago
[02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:32.560]  there's already been 301 views
[02:10:32.560 --> 02:10:34.560]  this one's destined to get millions
[02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:36.560]  and it's been up just a couple minutes
[02:10:36.560 --> 02:10:39.560]  it's going up on infowars.com right now
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:42.560]  if you're a radio listener and you want to see this
[02:10:42.560 --> 02:10:44.560]  all these explosions and the rest of it
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:47.560]  three comments
[02:10:47.560 --> 02:10:51.560]  excellent clip
[02:10:51.560 --> 02:10:53.560]  next comment
[02:10:53.560 --> 02:10:55.560]  by Naomi Agony probably a troll
[02:10:55.560 --> 02:10:58.560]  basically you're saying kill everyone
[02:10:58.560 --> 02:11:00.560]  who doesn't agree with you
[02:11:00.560 --> 02:11:02.560]  I say no such thing
[02:11:02.560 --> 02:11:04.560]  I say we're firing bullets of truth
[02:11:04.560 --> 02:11:06.560]  into the sack of lies
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:08.560]  that's the new world order
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:11.560]  and then this quote racist bleeping gun owners
[02:11:11.560 --> 02:11:14.560]  hey Tyrone that doesn't work anymore
[02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:16.560]  just saying that you know
[02:11:16.560 --> 02:11:19.560]  I like a gray suit not a blue suit that's racist
[02:11:19.560 --> 02:11:22.560]  I like vanilla ice cream not mint ice cream that's racist
[02:11:22.560 --> 02:11:25.560]  or I don't want the TSA to grope me
[02:11:25.560 --> 02:11:26.560]  oh you're a conspiracy theorist
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:28.560]  I've had them say that to me and other people
[02:11:28.560 --> 02:11:31.560]  now having an opinion is kooky and weird
[02:11:31.560 --> 02:11:33.560]  or knowing what 2 plus 2 equals
[02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:35.560]  you folks don't control reality
[02:11:35.560 --> 02:11:37.560]  and all your race baiting and the rest of it
[02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:38.560]  has blown up in your face
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:40.560]  your ratings are collapsing
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:44.560]  Fox News has more ratings than all the cable news shows combined
[02:11:44.560 --> 02:11:47.560]  because they at least put out something
[02:11:47.560 --> 02:11:51.560]  that isn't pure communist
[02:11:51.560 --> 02:11:55.560]  so that video just went up on infowars.com
[02:11:55.560 --> 02:11:57.560]  and prisonplanet.com
[02:11:57.560 --> 02:11:59.560]  John Bowne special report
[02:11:59.560 --> 02:12:01.560]  you didn't build it 2.0 it's excellent
[02:12:01.560 --> 02:12:04.560]  that's up on infowars.com as well
[02:12:04.560 --> 02:12:06.560]  very important article by Paul Joseph Watson
[02:12:06.560 --> 02:12:08.560]  will Republicans do their duty
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:10.560]  and begin impeachment of Obama
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:13.560]  or will the Republican leadership block that
[02:12:13.560 --> 02:12:17.560]  well of course they're not gonna do that
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:20.560]  because that'd be their job
[02:12:20.560 --> 02:12:23.560]  see they become accomplices
[02:12:23.560 --> 02:12:25.560]  and are aiding and abetting Obama
[02:12:25.560 --> 02:12:26.560]  when he's opening the borders
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:27.560]  and paying the ship illegals in
[02:12:27.560 --> 02:12:29.560]  and gonna give them all green cards
[02:12:29.560 --> 02:12:31.560]  if they don't begin impeachment
[02:12:31.560 --> 02:12:33.560]  because they have to or he'll continue the treason
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:37.560]  he's in control as the executive of the border patrol
[02:12:37.560 --> 02:12:39.560]  they've got to impeach him
[02:12:39.560 --> 02:12:42.560]  can you imagine what he'll do in 2 years as a dictator
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:44.560]  that's how he's acting
[02:12:44.560 --> 02:12:45.560]  even Jonathan Turley
[02:12:45.560 --> 02:12:47.560]  the big liberal professor said that
[02:12:47.560 --> 02:12:49.560]  that he's dwarfed Bush
[02:12:49.560 --> 02:12:52.560]  are you gonna sit here while Mitch McConnell
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:55.560]  and while John Boehner
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:58.560]  are all swollen up about how they're in charge now
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:13:00.560]  and we're like our strongman's in charge
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:02.560]  Obama's in charge you just don't like it
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:04.560]  Boehner's in charge you just don't like it
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:07.560]  oh shut up we got our guys in charge now
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:10.560]  he's not your guy
[02:13:10.560 --> 02:13:12.560]  if Ron Paul was in there and did everything he said he'd do
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:14.560]  he'd be our guy
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:16.560]  if Ron Paul was in there and did everything he said he'd do
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:17.560]  which he's doing pretty much
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:18.560]  he'd be our guy
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:19.560]  or Ted Cruz
[02:13:19.560 --> 02:13:21.560]  yeah you could say there are guys
[02:13:21.560 --> 02:13:23.560]  you could say Abbott in Texas
[02:13:23.560 --> 02:13:25.560]  from his voting record previously
[02:13:25.560 --> 02:13:26.560]  blocking UN power grabs
[02:13:26.560 --> 02:13:29.560]  blocking attempts to shut down our plants
[02:13:29.560 --> 02:13:30.560]  blocking all the stuff
[02:13:30.560 --> 02:13:32.560]  yeah you could say he's our guy
[02:13:32.560 --> 02:13:35.560]  are they perfect? No
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:39.560]  all right I want to go to your phone calls
[02:13:39.560 --> 02:13:41.560]  Hanna in Hawaii
[02:13:41.560 --> 02:13:43.560]  thanks for holding you're on the air
[02:13:43.560 --> 02:13:46.560]  what's your take on this major political realignment
[02:13:46.560 --> 02:13:49.560]  Alex, good to hear from you
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:51.560]  well thank you brother go ahead
[02:13:51.560 --> 02:13:53.560]  I'm calling from Hawaii
[02:13:53.560 --> 02:13:55.560]  I just wanted to give you some news
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:58.560]  Molly County had a vote to ban the growing of GMO crops
[02:13:58.560 --> 02:14:01.560]  and they won even though Monsanto and Dallas
[02:14:01.560 --> 02:14:04.560]  spent eight million in ads to keep the plants
[02:14:04.560 --> 02:14:07.560]  and growing and if I'm right Monsanto
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:09.560]  that's like where majority of their seed
[02:14:09.560 --> 02:14:12.560]  comes from the county of Molly
[02:14:12.560 --> 02:14:14.560]  so it's a pretty huge win
[02:14:14.560 --> 02:14:16.560]  and there should be some pretty big effects
[02:14:16.560 --> 02:14:19.560]  country-wide not just Hawaii
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:21.560]  well that's right and studies show
[02:14:21.560 --> 02:14:24.560]  that GMO crops on average are a scam
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:26.560]  they don't have increased yields long-term
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:29.560]  they kill the soil and a lot of that is
[02:14:29.560 --> 02:14:31.560]  because also the companies like to manipulate
[02:14:31.560 --> 02:14:34.560]  the farmers and screw them
[02:14:34.560 --> 02:14:36.560]  and the argument is well we pay farmers
[02:14:36.560 --> 02:14:38.560]  not to produce there's too much food anyway
[02:14:38.560 --> 02:14:39.560]  there's too many people
[02:14:39.560 --> 02:14:42.560]  America in 1955 you can look this up
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:44.560]  could feed the entire world
[02:14:44.560 --> 02:14:46.560]  the United States cannot even feed itself
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:50.560]  and now imports more than one-third of its food
[02:14:50.560 --> 02:14:52.560]  because of government policies
[02:14:52.560 --> 02:14:55.560]  but it is exciting that Hawaii and others are moving
[02:14:55.560 --> 02:14:57.560]  to block GMO crops
[02:14:57.560 --> 02:15:00.560]  I mean it's just destroying the environment
[02:15:00.560 --> 02:15:02.560]  but notice you don't hear all the Democrats
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:04.560]  calling to restrict that
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:09.560]  what's your take over all on where this is going
[02:15:09.560 --> 02:15:10.560]  I've got the headline
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:14.560]  Maui GMO ban passes after third printout
[02:15:14.560 --> 02:15:17.560]  I was on the third printout it came out
[02:15:17.560 --> 02:15:20.560]  so I voted yes for it
[02:15:20.560 --> 02:15:22.560]  I think there should be more testing
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:25.560]  before they just kind of force it down
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:27.560]  it's a small island you know
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:29.560]  it affects everybody and yes
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:31.560]  there were some jobs lost
[02:15:31.560 --> 02:15:33.560]  but I think if you look at it in the long term
[02:15:33.560 --> 02:15:37.560]  you know maybe a few hundred jobs may be lost
[02:15:37.560 --> 02:15:39.560]  but what's going to be the effect on the island
[02:15:39.560 --> 02:15:41.560]  and the people and everything around it
[02:15:41.560 --> 02:15:43.560]  in you know 10, 20, 30 years
[02:15:43.560 --> 02:15:46.560]  sure well I've studied GMO intensely
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:49.560]  and I appreciate your call and economics
[02:15:49.560 --> 02:15:51.560]  and I've studied the market
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:53.560]  and I use this example almost every week
[02:15:53.560 --> 02:15:56.560]  because it's so sterling it's so crystal clear
[02:15:56.560 --> 02:15:59.560]  15, 20 years ago you couldn't find organic food
[02:15:59.560 --> 02:16:02.560]  but at weird little shops
[02:16:02.560 --> 02:16:04.560]  but people began to buy it
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:07.560]  and so over the next decade or two
[02:16:07.560 --> 02:16:09.560]  more people got involved
[02:16:09.560 --> 02:16:12.560]  their private certification system set up
[02:16:12.560 --> 02:16:15.560]  trusted name brands got involved
[02:16:15.560 --> 02:16:17.560]  and now you can get pretty healthy
[02:16:17.560 --> 02:16:19.560]  non GMO high quality food
[02:16:19.560 --> 02:16:21.560]  in some cases for lower prices
[02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:23.560]  than the GMO garbage
[02:16:23.560 --> 02:16:26.560]  that's a total flip
[02:16:26.560 --> 02:16:28.560]  because when people get involved in a market
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:30.560]  then other people get involved
[02:16:30.560 --> 02:16:33.560]  as it becomes lucrative and then it creates competition
[02:16:33.560 --> 02:16:35.560]  and that's what ends up happening
[02:16:35.560 --> 02:16:39.560]  and so I will guarantee you
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:44.560]  in fact I know Hawaii has a huge organic produce market
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:46.560]  it's like the little you know California
[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:48.560]  but California is in a drought
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:51.560]  and so those niches
[02:16:51.560 --> 02:16:54.560]  that have been taken out by a GMO planting man
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:56.560]  will get filled
[02:16:56.560 --> 02:16:59.560]  by other cleaner industries
[02:16:59.560 --> 02:17:01.560]  and see people too
[02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:03.560]  and hear me talk about this thing
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:05.560]  what are you like a democrat, a communist or something
[02:17:05.560 --> 02:17:07.560]  listen I pick and choose after research what I stand for
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:09.560]  I'm not partisan
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:12.560]  the environmentalists are a bunch of land grabbing crooks at the top
[02:17:12.560 --> 02:17:15.560]  at the ground level they're great people
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:17.560]  there are a lot of good ideas
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:19.560]  our planet is in trouble
[02:17:19.560 --> 02:17:21.560]  I mean you don't go around planting
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:23.560]  here's an example
[02:17:23.560 --> 02:17:25.560]  they've now released in the Pacific Ocean
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:27.560]  salmon that are three times the size
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:29.560]  of normal salmon
[02:17:29.560 --> 02:17:31.560]  and in a major university study
[02:17:31.560 --> 02:17:33.560]  that was Washington state
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:35.560]  they found within 40 generations
[02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:37.560]  all other salmon would be extinct
[02:17:37.560 --> 02:17:39.560]  because they can't compete with these fish
[02:17:39.560 --> 02:17:41.560]  and these fish have insect and plant genes in them
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:43.560]  and will begin mutating
[02:17:43.560 --> 02:17:45.560]  see you don't change something's genetics
[02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:47.560]  and then it just stays like that
[02:17:47.560 --> 02:17:49.560]  when it breeds
[02:17:49.560 --> 02:17:51.560]  then its eggs
[02:17:51.560 --> 02:17:53.560]  and the sperm are mutated
[02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:55.560]  and then they create new mutations
[02:17:57.560 --> 02:17:59.560]  and that's a problem with GMO produce
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:01.560]  is farmers will tell you
[02:18:01.560 --> 02:18:03.560]  they have to keep buying new seeds
[02:18:03.560 --> 02:18:05.560]  because if they don't buy the new one, second generation seeds
[02:18:05.560 --> 02:18:07.560]  if they even grow
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:09.560]  it's a freak show
[02:18:09.560 --> 02:18:11.560]  and we've got
[02:18:11.560 --> 02:18:13.560]  last time I checked
[02:18:13.560 --> 02:18:15.560]  more than 10,000
[02:18:15.560 --> 02:18:17.560]  look it up
[02:18:17.560 --> 02:18:19.560]  pharmacological GMO crops
[02:18:19.560 --> 02:18:21.560]  I'm going to say that again
[02:18:21.560 --> 02:18:23.560]  more than 10,000
[02:18:23.560 --> 02:18:25.560]  that number is a few years old
[02:18:25.560 --> 02:18:27.560]  more than 10,000
[02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:29.560]  pharmacological GMO crops
[02:18:29.560 --> 02:18:31.560]  let me just give you two GMO crops
[02:18:31.560 --> 02:18:33.560]  one of them is currently growing all over the US
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:35.560]  Ebola
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:37.560]  vaccine in it
[02:18:37.560 --> 02:18:39.560]  in the corn live
[02:18:39.560 --> 02:18:41.560]  attenuated Ebola
[02:18:41.560 --> 02:18:45.560]  you can program a plant to grow a virus
[02:18:45.560 --> 02:18:47.560]  now what did protein gene
[02:18:47.560 --> 02:18:49.560]  look up AP 10 years ago
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:51.560]  the government got concern of people with space suits
[02:18:51.560 --> 02:18:53.560]  out in Texas killing it
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:55.560]  we reported before it was in the AP
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:57.560]  they had corn that grew live
[02:18:57.560 --> 02:18:59.560]  they claimed attenuated though
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:01.560]  but it was still whole virus
[02:19:01.560 --> 02:19:03.560]  HIV
[02:19:03.560 --> 02:19:05.560]  for a HIV vaccine
[02:19:05.560 --> 02:19:07.560]  so they don't just grow vaccines
[02:19:07.560 --> 02:19:09.560]  now in monkey kidneys
[02:19:09.560 --> 02:19:11.560]  or
[02:19:11.560 --> 02:19:13.560]  in a fetal tissue
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:15.560]  where they get their
[02:19:15.560 --> 02:19:17.560]  Pepsi flavor secret
[02:19:17.560 --> 02:19:19.560]  see how over the top that statement is
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:21.560]  but it's true
[02:19:21.560 --> 02:19:23.560]  Pepsi flavor testing is done with fetal tissue
[02:19:23.560 --> 02:19:25.560]  you can't make that up
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:29.560]  just like you can't make up
[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:31.560]  10,000 crops
[02:19:31.560 --> 02:19:33.560]  with Ebola
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:35.560]  and HIV growing
[02:19:35.560 --> 02:19:37.560]  you think that's going to get out of hand boys and girls
[02:19:37.560 --> 02:19:39.560]  you think that's a threat
[02:19:39.560 --> 02:19:41.560]  hmm
[02:19:41.560 --> 02:19:43.560]  hmm
[02:19:43.560 --> 02:19:45.560]  that's biological warfare
[02:19:45.560 --> 02:19:47.560]  I mean it's a wonder we're even still alive
[02:19:47.560 --> 02:19:49.560]  we're not in Kansas anymore as I say
[02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:51.560]  the Air Force came out 12 years ago
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:53.560]  and admitted they've created any matter bombs
[02:19:53.560 --> 02:19:55.560]  in the San Francisco Chronicle
[02:19:55.560 --> 02:19:57.560]  we'll be back with Ray, Steven, Jason
[02:19:57.560 --> 02:19:59.560]  Matt, Patrick and others
[02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:07.560]  do you lay awake at night and worry about the health and safety of you and your loved ones?
[02:20:07.560 --> 02:20:09.560]  do you wonder what would happen if you weren't able to get to a hospital or doctor?
[02:20:09.560 --> 02:20:11.560]  how can you keep your family safe against the deadly pathogens
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:13.560]  that are beginning to emerge in the world today?
[02:20:13.560 --> 02:20:15.560]  give yourself peace of mind
[02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:17.560]  with supernatural silver
[02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:19.560]  supernatural silver is turning heads

[02:20:21.560 --> 02:20:23.560]  in the fight against bacteria
[02:20:23.560 --> 02:20:25.560]  viruses and fungus
[02:20:25.560 --> 02:20:27.560]  supernatural silver can be taken internally
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:29.560]  or used topically
[02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:31.560]  to help the body's own immune system
[02:20:31.560 --> 02:20:33.560]  fight off disease much more effectively
[02:20:33.560 --> 02:20:35.560]  supernatural silver has been tested
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:37.560]  at independent universities and laboratories
[02:20:37.560 --> 02:20:39.560]  around the world and has been proven
[02:20:39.560 --> 02:20:41.560]  to be safe and highly effective against
[02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:43.560]  some of the planet's deadliest pathogens
[02:20:43.560 --> 02:20:45.560]  there is no better product

[02:21:01.560 --> 02:21:03.560]  the first confirmed case of Ebola
[02:21:03.560 --> 02:21:05.560]  appeared in the US
[02:21:05.560 --> 02:21:07.560]  this combined with several other unidentified viruses

[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:31.360]  Obamacare we're not gonna be my best imitation of him we're not gonna be
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:36.560]  defaulting on the debt or shutting down the government and all that means is
[02:24:36.560 --> 02:24:41.960]  we're just gonna continue to bankrupt the country and all the reporters are
[02:24:41.960 --> 02:24:45.000]  talking about his bipartisanship and working together and he's like yes we're
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:51.240]  gonna work together on on on what about investigations of fast and furious what
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:55.440]  about Benghazi what about shutting down the power plants what about opening up
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:24:58.920]  the borders what about what about what about oh they're not gonna do anything
[02:24:58.920 --> 02:25:03.240]  about that can you believe that the Republicans have the House and Senate
[02:25:03.240 --> 02:25:08.480]  and they're not gonna repeal Obamacare how are they gonna get away with that are
[02:25:08.480 --> 02:25:13.440]  we gonna let them get away with that that's the headline will Republicans
[02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:20.000]  will Republican leadership get away with not repealing Obamacare
[02:25:21.640 --> 02:25:27.520]  Republican leadership we won't repeal Obamacare shocker will they get away
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:35.680]  with it everyone I know has had their premiums the lowest is 60 70% increase
[02:25:35.680 --> 02:25:40.560]  most people it's doubled and then we're getting notices that get ready it's
[02:25:40.560 --> 02:25:44.760]  about to get even worse and then you complain and they go shut up racist no
[02:25:44.760 --> 02:25:49.280]  one had their premium go up even though they admit their skyrocketing I've been
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:54.120]  in clinics in places that's where I tend to go I got something going on and it's
[02:25:54.120 --> 02:25:56.960]  a lot quicker not as dangerous as hospitals all the killer bugs in them
[02:25:56.960 --> 02:26:01.800]  newer clinics are and there's always people going well wait a minute I came
[02:26:01.800 --> 02:26:05.160]  in to get my medication to check up six months ago it was half of this and you
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:07.920]  hear I'm going well this is the Affordable Care Act let us explain
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:11.160]  there's some literature we're sorry we're not the insurance company and they're
[02:26:11.160 --> 02:26:16.320]  just like what and boy they get mad and let me tell you for whatever reason these
[02:26:16.320 --> 02:26:19.360]  clinics I've been almost every time it's been old black women and stuff and they
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:23.000]  get really upset because they're in there paying for their health care and
[02:26:23.000 --> 02:26:29.640]  they're getting screwed over and it's gonna get a lot worse and it makes me so
[02:26:29.640 --> 02:26:36.920]  angry and the Supreme Court ruled it's a tax to the insurance companies and
[02:26:36.920 --> 02:26:41.360]  now those are the people that aren't creating jobs when they talk about
[02:26:41.360 --> 02:26:45.800]  corporations not making jobs those are the parasites that are sock puppeting
[02:26:45.800 --> 02:26:51.760]  John Boehner so that we can't repeal it they paid close to a billion dollars
[02:26:51.760 --> 02:26:56.200]  the last five years to get that lobbied through and then implemented and they
[02:26:56.200 --> 02:26:59.840]  paid for it and they think they own Congress and they don't care of Obama
[02:26:59.840 --> 02:27:03.920]  cares 80 plus percent unpopular and they don't care if you don't like it they
[02:27:03.920 --> 02:27:08.800]  are going to sit there and squat on you like a bully spitting in your face till

[02:27:43.240 --> 02:27:51.000]  happened to me political arena the past 24 hours Obama has been arrogant from
[02:27:51.000 --> 02:27:56.560]  from the day that he left Harvard to to the day just keep on using his pen oh
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:28:02.520]  yeah he came out today and said that he doesn't feel repudiated no exactly but
[02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:07.360]  he also knows that he has the same old boys working for him now that we're
[02:28:07.360 --> 02:28:12.040]  working for him three days ago just to be a different student so so why why not
[02:28:12.040 --> 02:28:18.720]  be arrogant he knows that whoever he can turn on his Democrat buddies not
[02:28:18.720 --> 02:28:22.320]  support them the Republicans are going to get in and we're going to do it in
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:26.040]  what's anyway that's right what about your rats Harry Reid is now tearing into
[02:28:26.040 --> 02:28:31.200]  Obama when Harry Reid is pushing the exact same policies as Obama when
[02:28:31.200 --> 02:28:35.360]  Obama was at Harvard I mean Harry Reid was in Congress when Obama was at
[02:28:35.360 --> 02:28:41.000]  Harvard pushing the same stuff what no honor among thieves is all I can say and
[02:28:41.000 --> 02:28:46.120]  they are just a pack of trash and you know Obama's been playing golf with
[02:28:46.120 --> 02:28:49.920]  Boehner and hanging out with Mitch McConnell and they're gonna have a
[02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:56.000]  nut on Friday him and Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell supported the banker
[02:28:56.000 --> 02:28:59.040]  bailout Mitch McConnell just said in the press conference there's not going to
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:05.480]  go to the shutdown cuz see he's the boss not the other 99 senators voting not
[02:29:05.480 --> 02:29:13.200]  the 400 some people in the house Mitch McConnell see he's in charge and we
[02:29:13.200 --> 02:29:18.520]  have to turn around and we have to get to our senators and our Congress people
[02:29:18.520 --> 02:29:21.640]  and make them quite aware that they're they're also going to be out of the

[02:37:01.320 --> 02:37:27.440]  I don't got it holy hell that's what's happening is out of sore media as we
[02:37:27.440 --> 02:37:42.920]  fire bullets of truth into their sack of rotting lies man I've lost a lot of
[02:37:42.920 --> 02:37:49.160]  weight we shot that about two months ago and I've been so busy we never put it
[02:37:49.160 --> 02:37:52.880]  together but Josh Owens did a great job on camera and editing that and that's
[02:37:52.880 --> 02:37:55.880]  just promoting gun culture freaking out all the trendies out there that are in
[02:37:55.880 --> 02:38:00.080]  the comments right now going crazy saying we should be arrested the videos on
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:04.000]  the front page of prison planet calm and info wars calm we're gonna tweet it out
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:09.080]  right now at real Alex Jones freedom grows out of the barrel of a gun and the
[02:38:09.080 --> 02:38:13.760]  people online it's the minority of them but they're saying no death grows out of
[02:38:13.760 --> 02:38:17.920]  it well yes when Mao say tongues the only one with the guns that's the guy that
[02:38:17.920 --> 02:38:22.520]  ran China and killed 80 plus million people the greatest mass murder in
[02:38:22.520 --> 02:38:27.200]  history he said political power grows out of the barrel of a gun but see when
[02:38:27.200 --> 02:38:31.880]  it's decentralized and it's in the people's hands like Switzerland you have
[02:38:31.880 --> 02:38:36.920]  the lowest crime rate in the world they don't have Chicago's they don't have
[02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:42.360]  New York's they don't have DC's they don't have places where guns are banned so
[02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:48.280]  they have very low crime and that's why we say political power grows out of the
[02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:51.640]  barrel of a gun and of the political powers in the people's hands and
[02:38:51.640 --> 02:38:56.160]  decentralized if everybody's got a gun on the block and knows how to use it do
[02:38:56.160 --> 02:38:59.480]  you think the criminals are gonna go rob there no or they're gonna wait till
[02:38:59.480 --> 02:39:03.640]  you're gone out of town that's why you don't have in Texas hardly any home
[02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:08.360]  invasions compared to Illinois or New York and folks in rural areas of New
[02:39:08.360 --> 02:39:12.400]  York and Illinois don't break into houses because you get your butt shot off
[02:39:12.400 --> 02:39:18.800]  and so the collectivists are calling me a racist in the YouTube comments and they
[02:39:18.800 --> 02:39:21.680]  really mean it that's how dumb they are it's all they've got intellectually
[02:39:21.680 --> 02:39:25.640]  they're so stupid they don't get on the real liberal I'm the classical liberal
[02:39:25.640 --> 02:39:29.120]  in a Thomas Jefferson sense I want you to keep your money run your own life
[02:39:29.120 --> 02:39:33.840]  have your own religion or not be able to defend yourself or not sexually as
[02:39:33.840 --> 02:39:39.320]  long as you don't try it with my kids ain't knock yourself out I'm more of a
[02:39:39.320 --> 02:39:43.160]  Thomas Jefferson type towards Washington you can say was America's first
[02:39:43.160 --> 02:39:47.560]  conservative and the founder of the army you can say Thomas Jefferson was the
[02:39:47.560 --> 02:39:51.080]  first liberal and I mean I think of myself really as a liberal at the end
[02:39:51.080 --> 02:39:54.520]  of the day I mean I just live and let live have your own life just stay out
[02:39:54.520 --> 02:39:58.200]  of my way you understand I don't belong to you you're not gonna run my life
[02:39:58.200 --> 02:40:01.120]  you're not gonna tell me what to thank you're not gonna tell me what to do I've
[02:40:01.120 --> 02:40:07.200]  had enough of it but I see that fascist mayor down there trying to indict and
[02:40:07.200 --> 02:40:11.320]  doing subpoenas of preachers because they're criticizing homosexuality hey
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:17.800]  lady shut up I believe in your free speech till you try to shut other people's
[02:40:17.800 --> 02:40:24.800]  down then you need to stop if you disagree with those people disagree with
[02:40:24.800 --> 02:40:29.120]  them but don't sit there and try to shut them down so I say shut up I mean shut
[02:40:29.120 --> 02:40:33.560]  up your lawsuits and she has done that but it shows their instinct and it shows
[02:40:33.560 --> 02:40:37.800]  what they want to do and it shows who they are they're totalitarians they're
[02:40:37.800 --> 02:40:42.680]  authoritarians you can see that full video of your radio listener on info
[02:40:42.680 --> 02:40:46.920]  wars.com video freedom grows out of the barrel of a gun so short little late
[02:40:46.920 --> 02:40:50.200]  and a half minute piece I think it's the best gun show we've put out and then we
[02:40:50.200 --> 02:40:53.840]  got 50 cows shooting through armor and everything else and you know what we're
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:57.360]  not trying to show off or the best shots in the world or anything either I mean
[02:40:57.360 --> 02:41:03.640]  when I was like 18 I could shoot a thousand yards with a Remington 308
[02:41:03.640 --> 02:41:09.360]  Remington 700 I could shoot bullseye you know at 300 yards I could hit the right
[02:41:09.360 --> 02:41:12.160]  in the center of the target of a thousand yards I can't probably do that
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:16.840]  today I can shoot in the center of the target at 300 yards and maybe hit the
[02:41:16.840 --> 02:41:23.120]  target period at a thousand but most those guns weren't even mine they're
[02:41:23.120 --> 02:41:26.760]  they're Shane Steiners my buddies we just pull up they aren't even perfectly
[02:41:26.760 --> 02:41:30.360]  sided in just start shooting well that's what it's all about just having fun not
[02:41:30.360 --> 02:41:33.480]  not not you're not showing off that we're you know the best gun in the west or
[02:41:33.480 --> 02:41:39.320]  something and Leanne had shot guns once at Central Texas gunworks last year or
[02:41:39.320 --> 02:41:42.840]  maybe it was earlier this year she saw a shotgun and a handgun and I guess kind of
[02:41:42.840 --> 02:41:45.360]  as a joke I mean I mean they told her they said pull it into your shoulder
[02:41:45.360 --> 02:41:49.840]  when she shot the 12 gauge pump and it you know really bruised her and then she
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:53.720]  didn't like it and that's really because they you really got to learn to pull a
[02:41:53.720 --> 02:41:57.840]  gun into your shoulder and just relax and then it doesn't even kick I mean I
[02:41:57.840 --> 02:42:03.080]  don't think Barrett's kick very Barrett 50s except for your teeth clanking it's
[02:42:03.080 --> 02:42:06.920]  not even so much the kick it's the it's the it's the it's the receiver clacking
[02:42:06.920 --> 02:42:14.360]  back and clacking back in there's a clanking that I don't like but I don't
[02:42:14.360 --> 02:42:18.320]  know guns kick someone I was a kid they just don't seem to kick now of course
[02:42:18.320 --> 02:42:22.640]  sometimes about shoot a hundred rounds folding a 50 in my hand and then throw
[02:42:22.640 --> 02:42:26.040]  my back out before so I guess there is some kick there even if you don't feel
[02:42:26.040 --> 02:42:32.160]  it but she shot 223s 45s you name it and just loved them and was just so
[02:42:32.160 --> 02:42:36.480]  excited and then went out and got a gun and it's going out and getting lessons
[02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:42.240]  and we can do that with any woman she was shot bullseye the first three times
[02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:47.520]  she shot at about 50 yards with a 223 shooting bull a bowling pins center of
[02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:52.480]  mass right in them later she was shooting bullseye at 100 yards I took her one
[02:42:52.480 --> 02:42:57.960]  shot with the 45 to start hitting bullseye and women on average even if the
[02:42:57.960 --> 02:43:03.760]  Olympics are better shots than men it's very narrow statistic but but they're
[02:43:03.760 --> 02:43:07.880]  just slightly better than men without having to drink alcohol you know most
[02:43:07.880 --> 02:43:12.600]  athletes aren't supposed to take steroids or stuff like Lance Armstrong
[02:43:12.600 --> 02:43:16.480]  did well in the Olympics sometimes they've got a test I've read that that
[02:43:16.480 --> 02:43:21.280]  the shooters aren't taking Valium or drinking beer because the big secret to
[02:43:21.280 --> 02:43:25.520]  shooting is being calm and relaxed and once you get a woman to be calm and
[02:43:25.520 --> 02:43:29.520]  relaxed with with with a gun they're great so the feminist implied though
[02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:32.160]  with Hollywood that women don't know how to use guns women don't know how to
[02:43:32.160 --> 02:43:37.360]  fight I mean I wrestle my 10-year-old daughter and she kicks my butt sometimes
[02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:40.600]  I don't know people are talking about but I guess folks are raising their
[02:43:40.600 --> 02:43:44.600]  daughters to be these wimps around here in Texas we don't raise our daughters to
[02:43:44.600 --> 02:43:49.120]  be wimps that's because we're you know sexist pieces of garbage you know just
[02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:52.240]  women just jump on the horses jump in the four-wheel drive go out and skin the
[02:43:52.240 --> 02:43:56.440]  buck go out and shoot the gun and go home and cook dinner or maybe daddy's
[02:43:56.440 --> 02:44:01.960]  cooking dinner tonight but see women and men have been teamed up in primitive
[02:44:01.960 --> 02:44:05.280]  situations that's what the system doesn't like is men and women working
[02:44:05.280 --> 02:44:10.720]  together as a unit and then seeing their family is like a corporation a base of
[02:44:10.720 --> 02:44:14.440]  operations so their kids are successful and their kids are successful to build
[02:44:14.440 --> 02:44:18.320]  the house on the hill that's how successful families operate but the
[02:44:18.320 --> 02:44:24.120]  modern feminist magazines I don't care if it's Esquire I don't care if it's
[02:44:24.120 --> 02:44:28.280]  Vanity Fair I don't care if it's Cosmopolitan you open them up it's all
[02:44:28.280 --> 02:44:31.040]  about how to control men and how they're your enemy and how you got to be a
[02:44:31.040 --> 02:44:34.200]  whore to get ahead and and just all that the opposite of what I think of
[02:44:34.200 --> 02:44:39.600]  feminism and it's meant to screw women and screw men up now men are busy
[02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:43.600]  playing sports center all day and video games and you know women aren't attracted
[02:44:43.600 --> 02:44:51.640]  to that it's just so exciting to take anti gunners out and to convert them and
[02:44:51.640 --> 02:44:58.400]  Leanne wasn't an anti gunner she was just scared of them and after she shot
[02:44:58.400 --> 02:45:05.680]  about an hour we had a little bitty charges of Tannerite you know it's not
[02:45:05.680 --> 02:45:10.280]  explosive explosive stimulant and you know if you don't hit them dead on they
[02:45:10.280 --> 02:45:14.320]  don't blow up so there was this one charge I mean I shot four charges in a
[02:45:14.320 --> 02:45:19.760]  road about a hundred yards but there was this one that we couldn't get and then
[02:45:19.760 --> 02:45:26.040]  Leanne just freehand boom within an hour I saw her aim I forget that gun
[02:45:26.040 --> 02:45:30.560]  change guy it's like a 223 but it's real short I forget all the names and she
[02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:33.720]  just pulls the trigger and boom it blows up and then she aims at a bowling pin
[02:45:33.720 --> 02:45:39.040]  from the hip at about 75 80 yards boom knocks that down and it's just once you
[02:45:39.040 --> 02:45:45.880]  just get into a gun it's just amazing and and there she was so go get lessons
[02:45:45.880 --> 02:45:49.560]  be careful stow them properly the best way to have gun safety with your kids
[02:45:49.560 --> 02:45:53.440]  is teach them how to use it teach them the danger and then they won't go and
[02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:55.960]  get it when their kids are over and shoot people so obviously in this day and age
[02:45:55.960 --> 02:46:01.080]  secure firearms but pass that go out and teach somebody how to shoot if you want
[02:46:01.080 --> 02:46:04.640]  to beat these gun grabbers that's the biggest thing we can do all right I'm
[02:46:04.640 --> 02:46:09.080]  now persevering on guns I apologize Patrick and FEMA Regent in and then we'll
[02:46:09.080 --> 02:46:13.160]  go to Steve and Jason in Canada and Matt in Canada a lot of calls from Canada
[02:46:13.160 --> 02:46:18.360]  George in Connecticut go ahead Patrick good morning Alex and Alex yeah I voted
[02:46:18.360 --> 02:46:25.760]  against major 91 Oregon Oregon the medical or the legalization medical
[02:46:25.760 --> 02:46:31.400]  the American wanna legalization yes sir and the reason I did is because when
[02:46:31.400 --> 02:46:35.480]  they created that bill they completely embedded and surrounded it with the
[02:46:35.480 --> 02:46:42.120]  police state and I convinced a whole bunch of people to include people that
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:46.320]  are marijuana smokers that they should vote against it and they did only because
[02:46:46.320 --> 02:46:50.720]  of that 24 percent of it goes to the schools which are a weapon system
[02:46:50.720 --> 02:46:54.960]  against our children and the rest of it goes to a police state which is
[02:46:54.960 --> 02:46:59.160]  completely embedded and surrounded that that bill that's why I voted against it
[02:46:59.160 --> 02:47:04.080]  well I've studied the medical marijuana movement and I'm for
[02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:07.720]  decriminalization not because I support drug culture but because I know that it
[02:47:07.720 --> 02:47:11.040]  makes the drug culture bigger to have them illegal because it jacks up prices
[02:47:11.040 --> 02:47:16.760]  and I know in like Michigan and other states that have quasi legalized it
[02:47:16.760 --> 02:47:24.120]  Colorado you waive your rights to social workers to home inspection your kids
[02:47:24.120 --> 02:47:29.440]  are into the system and so you're like becoming a slave or something in a lot
[02:47:29.440 --> 02:47:33.480]  of states and so you're now in a social worker system with the police
[02:47:33.480 --> 02:47:38.360]  basically on a type of parole and they don't tell people you're waiving your
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:43.000]  rights in an extra judicial agreement to get your hands on some Mary Jane and
[02:47:43.000 --> 02:47:47.280]  look I know it's great for glaucoma I know it's great for nausea and people
[02:47:47.280 --> 02:47:52.920]  have chemotherapy I know that it is a plant that has hundreds of really great
[02:47:52.920 --> 02:47:57.800]  medicinal reasons for people to use it it's certainly abused so I think people
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:02.000]  should have access to it but it's definitely being abused as medical
[02:48:02.000 --> 02:48:05.800]  marijuana but you can't penalize people that really need it because folks are
[02:48:05.800 --> 02:48:10.880]  abusing it so I'm just for decriminalization period and they should
[02:48:10.880 --> 02:48:14.960]  sell it like you sell it at the liquor store and just forget this whole
[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:18.720]  medical thing you know I mean they had whiskey as medicine forever as well if
[02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:22.360]  somebody had a headache or a toothache or was about to have surgery or you know
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:26.640]  wanted to relax them they used to get off the fighter you know missions that
[02:48:26.640 --> 02:48:30.240]  give them whiskey I mean I just say sell it in liquor stores the government can
[02:48:30.240 --> 02:48:34.240]  have its cut and then that's the end of it we don't need more bureaucracy I
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:39.880]  appreciate your call let's talk to Steve in Florida you're on the air hey

[02:54:37.880 --> 02:54:41.520]  voter fraud we know by the illegals and others and Democrats voting over and
[02:54:41.520 --> 02:54:44.960]  over again they got caught all over the country but still that wasn't enough to
[02:54:44.960 --> 02:54:49.840]  stop this landslide that is not an endorsement of the Republicans but is
[02:54:49.840 --> 02:54:54.680]  a repudiation of Obama now if McConnell and Boehner and the other
[02:54:54.680 --> 02:55:04.720]  Republican leaders don't try to at least do some reforms cut some of the taxes
[02:55:04.720 --> 02:55:08.960]  stop trying to drive the country over a cliff and bankrupt us and if they don't
[02:55:08.960 --> 02:55:12.560]  control the borders and go for amnesty and let Obama act as an executive
[02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:17.080]  dictator they are then aiding and abetting it and they will go the way of
[02:55:17.080 --> 02:55:21.920]  Cantor and that's what you let them know we're gonna kick you out you little
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:27.000]  narcissistic creature if you don't reverse this if you keep playing politics

[02:55:33.200 --> 02:55:38.080]  McConnell build up Boehner so they can be politically damaged down the road

[03:01:18.680 --> 03:01:22.880]  well let you guys know up here in Canada you have a lot of followers we even have
[03:01:22.880 --> 03:01:26.920]  people up here with tattoos on their arms with info or so well folks ought to
[03:01:26.920 --> 03:01:31.120]  send me a photo of that I'd retweet it that's pretty cool absolutely I was
[03:01:31.120 --> 03:01:36.720]  gonna do that anyway on my point I want to let everybody know out there and
[03:01:36.720 --> 03:01:40.600]  this is something that's happened to me personally the banks out there I wanted
[03:01:40.600 --> 03:01:46.000]  to hit a point that you made about 20 minutes ago about how you're a new
[03:01:46.000 --> 03:01:48.880]  business you want to get things started and they do everything to push you down
[03:01:48.880 --> 03:01:54.440]  I'm a fine example of that because I came back to Canada after DJing all over
[03:01:54.440 --> 03:01:59.320]  the world with an invention a DJ invention first to market one of a kind
[03:01:59.320 --> 03:02:05.400]  and the banks did not support me when I had to make an insurance claim to cover
[03:02:05.400 --> 03:02:14.280]  my credit card balances so my all of my credit went into bad credit and if they
[03:02:14.280 --> 03:02:18.320]  didn't want to cover the claim on that so I told them what was going to happen
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:23.920]  and they didn't even want to help me out they I said I'm gonna lose my business
[03:02:23.920 --> 03:02:28.880]  if you don't cover me for four to six months maximum on my minimum coverage
[03:02:28.880 --> 03:02:33.160]  they looked at me and they smiled sir it's always been like that the big
[03:02:33.160 --> 03:02:38.920]  ultra-rich that aren't free market instinctively like a you know a father
[03:02:38.920 --> 03:02:45.400]  lion trying to eat his son they want to mean they want to take them out let us
[03:02:45.400 --> 03:02:50.560]  show inaccurate what's the Disney movie about the lion in Africa what's that
[03:02:50.560 --> 03:02:55.720]  called the lion king and the real lion king is dad would eat him and and and
[03:02:55.720 --> 03:02:59.760]  that's basically what goes on here is this predatory thing where they don't
[03:02:59.760 --> 03:03:05.720]  want new businesses to form and operate and it's before in America that was not
[03:03:05.720 --> 03:03:09.560]  the rule that's what made us so great now we're going back into that kind of
[03:03:09.560 --> 03:03:13.400]  European model it's horrible thank you Jason God bless you Matt in Canada
[03:03:13.400 --> 03:03:19.200]  another Canadian colon in welcome hey how you doing Alex good brother oh thanks
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:21.600]  for having me on I love and respect everything you're doing I've been a
[03:03:21.600 --> 03:03:25.000]  long-time listener since well before 9-11 so I'm very happy to be on here
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:30.280]  first-time caller so I'm glad to hear you talking about the serious drug going
[03:03:30.280 --> 03:03:33.880]  on in California you know I think you and I both know and all your listeners
[03:03:33.880 --> 03:03:36.600]  know this is being done intentionally you know they're being created by
[03:03:36.600 --> 03:03:39.960]  Kim yeah no they have better Melinda Gates funded weather modification going
[03:03:39.960 --> 03:03:45.280]  on 24-7 over the West Coast unlike I mean it's the most targeted even
[03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:49.280]  meteorologists have shown it on mainstream news how they block the
[03:03:49.280 --> 03:03:54.520]  weatherfronts the water coming in with the aluminum dioxide it's incredible yeah
[03:03:54.520 --> 03:03:59.680]  exactly and you know they are basically trying to cut off our suit our food
[03:03:59.680 --> 03:04:03.520]  supply around the planet you know California's a bread basket of North
[03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:08.160]  America and I Joe ego and I are working and we think we found a solution and I
[03:04:08.160 --> 03:04:12.160]  want to share this with you guys because Illuminati and New World Order and you
[03:04:12.160 --> 03:04:16.240]  know the people at Bohemian Grove and they practice these satanic rituals they're
[03:04:16.240 --> 03:04:20.000]  telling us you know this truly is a spiritual battle for our hearts and mind
[03:04:20.000 --> 03:04:24.280]  sure we're almost out of time what's the solution okay so basically there's a
[03:04:24.280 --> 03:04:28.480]  scientist named Marcel Vogel he's invented these crystals that amplify
[03:04:28.480 --> 03:04:32.920]  your thoughts and basically we go to Mount Shaston California and we do
[03:04:32.920 --> 03:04:36.640]  basically these Native American rain ceremonies to bring rain and we can
[03:04:36.640 --> 03:04:39.840]  actually affect the weather in California and around the planet and bring
[03:04:39.840 --> 03:04:43.880]  healing energy back to the planet again well I know it'll draw attention to
[03:04:43.880 --> 03:04:48.360]  what's going on regardless interesting send me some information we could we
[03:04:48.360 --> 03:04:52.880]  could do a rain dance and ask that Bill Gates stop his secret geoengineering
[03:04:52.880 --> 03:04:56.760]  program which they admit he's doing it's just the details are secret well we
[03:04:56.760 --> 03:05:10.800]  got we've got the satellite photos
