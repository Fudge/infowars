[00:00.000 --> 00:14.240]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.240 --> 00:24.160]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones you want to know
[00:24.160 --> 00:29.440]  how we're losing control of our society and it's becoming a massive tyranny but every metric
[00:30.480 --> 00:36.320]  megastories and use television and the laziness of the general public the establishment basically
[00:36.320 --> 00:41.760]  exacerbates it rides it surfs it but at the end of the day you want to know the problem you
[00:41.760 --> 00:47.680]  don't know why we're in so much trouble look in the mirror in fact we intro the next segment
[00:47.680 --> 00:54.240]  with the fever and data piece we have I know why you did it you were scared I shouldn't you be
[00:56.080 --> 01:01.520]  terrorism biological warfare and more and the government offered you security all you had
[01:01.520 --> 01:07.120]  to do was stay silent and submit and so you did but now you've lost every basic freedom you have
[01:07.120 --> 01:13.520]  and you're not safe you're getting more and more unsafe every day because those that give up liberty
[01:13.520 --> 01:20.640]  will only get horrible degradation slavery and tyranny to paraphrase and expand on what V was saying
[01:24.640 --> 01:32.080]  mark dies has another video info wars calm prison planet calm video some Americans think
[01:32.080 --> 01:41.760]  Martin Luther King just died and I talked to people with PhDs and stuff and they are amazed
[01:41.760 --> 01:50.880]  PhDs and psychology sociology astrophysics you name it and they'll be amazed that I even know
[01:50.880 --> 01:57.600]  anything about their field or that I'm trying to show off when that it's just so interesting
[01:57.600 --> 02:04.720]  and I'm a generalist I I have general knowledge of all sorts of things it's not because I'm a
[02:04.720 --> 02:11.600]  show off or something I'm not probably that smart at the end of the day when you think
[02:11.600 --> 02:18.640]  of egghead smart mathematician smart but I am street smart and if you're street smart you want
[02:18.640 --> 02:24.880]  to know knowledge even if you're a sociopath knowing how things work can make you very rich
[02:28.320 --> 02:33.600]  in whatever endeavor you're involved in culturally rich financially rich spiritually rich
[02:33.600 --> 02:40.320]  and I look at this video we're going to play in the next segment the audio for radio listeners
[02:41.920 --> 02:45.760]  radio listeners go to info wars.com forward slash show to find the free video feed
[02:45.760 --> 02:51.680]  we got mark coming on middle of the next hour and mark just goes out there for like 30 minutes he
[02:51.680 --> 02:56.320]  doesn't need to stay out there all day to get idiots who think that Martin Luther King was the
[02:56.320 --> 03:03.200]  first man to walk on the moon and stuff like that I'm not joking this is the way the general
[03:03.200 --> 03:05.760]  public is so you see a headline like this
[03:08.800 --> 03:14.080]  and you know why this is happening middle class decline looms over final years of
[03:14.080 --> 03:19.600]  Obama presidency no that's not a weekly standard or washington times conservative headline that's
[03:19.600 --> 03:26.400]  Reuters middle class decline looms over final years of obama presidency biggest decline in
[03:26.400 --> 03:33.760]  the middle class since the great depression here's another nice article out of the japan times riches
[03:33.760 --> 03:38.560]  one percent will hold half of world wealth in 2016 oxfam says
[03:41.200 --> 03:44.320]  that's the oxfam global charity breaking it down into davis switzerland
[03:46.000 --> 03:50.640]  and i'm going to decipher why this is happening and why it's going to get a lot worse i mean
[03:50.640 --> 03:58.240]  we all know the basics globalism centralized rig games but you go look at the top one percent of
[03:58.240 --> 04:06.640]  the one percent they've got something like 65 percent of that wealth so let's be clear well
[04:06.640 --> 04:12.640]  over a third of global wealth but i forget these precise number it's something like that guys will
[04:12.640 --> 04:21.120]  you google uh ultra rich have over a third of world's wealth i want to say it's 40 something percent
[04:21.120 --> 04:26.320]  and then because they always just say one percent to confuse people but that top tiny little percent
[04:26.320 --> 04:31.280]  of the one percent you can look at the numbers they hold almost all of it and then they're
[04:31.280 --> 04:39.680]  waging war on the middle class when you look at the dutch and british royalty the Rothschilds
[04:39.680 --> 04:45.120]  the Rockefellers people like warren buffett bill gates i mean they're the ones goldman sacks jp
[04:45.120 --> 04:51.120]  morgan and they're funding ending free market well yeah they're pulling up the ladder to the hot

[08:12.640 --> 08:19.760]  suffering dammit why because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation words will
[08:19.760 --> 08:25.680]  always retain their power words over the means to meaning and for those who will listen the
[08:25.680 --> 08:32.400]  enunciation of truth the truth is there is something terribly wrong with this country isn't
[08:32.400 --> 08:37.200]  that you decided sir you wanted it foolproof you told me every television in longer cruelty and
[08:37.200 --> 08:42.480]  injustice intolerance and oppression and where once you have the freedom to object to something
[08:42.480 --> 08:48.480]  can speak as you saw fit you now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity
[08:48.480 --> 08:54.960]  and selecting your submachine cameras how did this happen who's to blame well certainly there are
[08:54.960 --> 09:01.040]  those for more responsible than others they will be held accountable but again truth be told if
[09:01.040 --> 09:08.240]  you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror i know why you did it i know you
[09:08.240 --> 09:15.840]  were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease there were a myriad of problems conspired to
[09:15.840 --> 09:22.320]  corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense fear got the best of you and in your panic
[09:22.320 --> 09:28.800]  you turn to the now high chancellor adam subtler he promised you border he promised you peace and
[09:28.800 --> 09:42.800]  all he demanded in return was your silent obedient consent there is a war it's happening now it will
[09:42.800 --> 09:50.880]  decide the fate of humanity the time to choose sides has come we are the resistance we are the info
[09:50.880 --> 09:57.840]  war i'm your host alex jones ladies and gentlemen thank you for joining us on this monday the 19th
[09:57.840 --> 10:08.160]  day of january 2015 mark dice documentary filmmaker bestselling author political analyst media
[10:08.160 --> 10:14.400]  analyst will be joining us he's done it again the video is on info wars dot com and prison
[10:14.400 --> 10:21.120]  planet dot com right now he joins us the middle of the next hour there's new video americans think
[10:21.120 --> 10:28.320]  martin luther king just died and was the first african-american to walk on the moon these are
[10:28.320 --> 10:35.840]  not cherry picked from idiot californians these are liberals we're able to do the same thing in
[10:35.840 --> 10:45.840]  austin the so-called trendy liberal is so stupid so uninformed it boggles the brain and again i use
[10:45.840 --> 10:53.200]  the term they would call themselves liberals these are tv head trendy fascist supporters who are
[10:53.200 --> 11:02.480]  dumber than a sack of rocks now mainline republicans aren't much better i'll be honest with you but at
[11:02.480 --> 11:06.240]  least they want private property and the right to self-defense and family
[11:11.680 --> 11:14.640]  they're silly and they're ignorant but they've got guts and guts is enough to rip off
[11:15.200 --> 11:17.760]  one more time full metal jacket
[11:22.320 --> 11:28.320]  but these people are scary i've sent my reporters out in austin to go to the trendy areas and people
[11:28.320 --> 11:33.280]  that brag that they've got degrees in chemistry want to ban dihydrogen monoxide on tape and
[11:33.280 --> 11:38.240]  they start hitting on leon macadamia i've got a degree in chemistry i agree we need to ban
[11:38.240 --> 11:44.320]  dihydrogen monoxide that's water of course ladies and gentlemen we use that as an illustration of
[11:45.120 --> 11:51.840]  carbon dioxide sounds scary like carbon monoxide that'll kill you carbon dioxide is what plants
[11:51.840 --> 11:59.360]  live off of and then they put off oxygen for us i had a caller though last week that brought up a
[11:59.360 --> 12:06.080]  point that is a concern for fossil fuel burning that it basically destroys oxygen when you burn
[12:06.080 --> 12:12.080]  stuff that is a good point and oxygen levels are dropping but see don't ever expect any real
[12:12.080 --> 12:16.880]  environmental angle to come out because special interests don't want that genetic engineering
[12:16.880 --> 12:24.240]  overfishing stuff like that nanotech i'm not an obstructionist i just most major scientists
[12:24.240 --> 12:28.320]  that are involved in this say there's a good chance some of this is going to end up destroying us
[12:28.320 --> 12:36.160]  are coming awful darn close like the old legend of atlantis developed some power source that blew
[12:36.160 --> 12:41.280]  up the whole island now i don't know if atlantis was real playdough said as it was in a history
[12:41.280 --> 12:47.840]  book he wrote that's incredibly accurate playdough said they had batteries with electricity people
[12:47.840 --> 12:51.200]  didn't know that was true till about 200 years ago when they found a bunch of them in Greece
[12:51.760 --> 12:58.880]  they since found them in Rome and Spain over 2000 years old but i'm digressing excuse me
[13:00.160 --> 13:07.680]  we are headed the way atlantis went so i don't know if atlantis was real but atlantis is probably
[13:07.680 --> 13:18.320]  just about ready to happen i want to have a controlled atlantis a controlled new atlantis
[13:18.320 --> 13:24.000]  and now that's high-level illuminati talk right there they say they want the new atlantis i see
[13:24.000 --> 13:29.440]  him building the new hell i'd like humanity to make it i'd like us to have advanced technologies
[13:29.440 --> 13:33.040]  i'd like my children and grandchildren and their children to live with your children in the future
[13:33.040 --> 13:39.600]  and have access to all that and not kill each other mindlessly instead i see the opposite of the
[13:40.240 --> 13:49.440]  atlantis society the good things of the fabled atlantis no war peace high technology people
[13:49.440 --> 13:55.360]  reportedly lived hundreds of years longer than they do now whether you believe that fable or not
[13:55.360 --> 14:05.840]  whether it's based in some truth the legend has some kernel to it we have the elysium of atlantis
[14:06.560 --> 14:14.720]  within our grasp the golden fields of elysium are within our grasp and the elite have made the
[14:14.720 --> 14:24.960]  decision that you and i will not have access to that they behave and operate as as if we
[14:24.960 --> 14:32.800]  don't exist anymore as if we don't matter as if we're bugs to be swept out of the way as ray
[14:32.800 --> 14:37.680]  Kurzweil said you may not take the brain chips and merge with the computers we may allow you to
[14:37.680 --> 14:42.640]  live or we may just step on you like a bug because our intelligence will be like that of a god
[14:42.640 --> 14:49.200]  compared to man today or that of a human to a roach i'm paraphrasing his quote you can look it up
[14:49.200 --> 14:57.440]  and that's a popular refrain they will achieve godhead and if you try to get in the way of it
[14:57.440 --> 15:02.960]  they will kill you you can say well that's not going to happen really i don't care whether it's
[15:02.960 --> 15:09.280]  peter field or ted turner they're all obsessed with life extension they're all obsessed with
[15:09.280 --> 15:14.800]  warren world government and merging with cybernetic technologies and why wouldn't they be obsessed with
[15:14.800 --> 15:22.080]  it everything that gallatin envisioned in 1855 has basically been realized
[15:24.240 --> 15:28.880]  so i gotta hand it to the british royal family and the rothschilds that put their money behind
[15:28.880 --> 15:35.840]  the gallatin plan that all major modern sciences now basically come out of he didn't just invent
[15:35.840 --> 15:40.720]  biometrics and eugenics he basically started the whole program because he had the funding
[15:40.720 --> 15:48.240]  to build over the british royal academy the most powerful academy in the world then and probably
[15:48.240 --> 15:49.040]  now
[15:51.760 --> 15:58.000]  and our world is to a great extent the competition between free humanity and what we've built
[15:58.000 --> 16:03.120]  and what the globalists have built are hijacked that we built so there's two parallel systems
[16:03.120 --> 16:10.560]  operating but now the technocracy is finally on its legs it's not a baby anymore it's a 14 year
[16:10.560 --> 16:18.160]  man and it's about to be a 20 year old man and then a 40 year old man in its prime that is ready to go
[16:19.760 --> 16:26.560]  and free humanity is in a poisoned stupor in the ditch rolling around vomiting basically
[16:27.280 --> 16:31.920]  while right next to us is growing the power force that is going to strangle us
[16:34.560 --> 16:39.440]  and the scheme of time if you want the allegory the 14 year old is walking across the street
[16:39.440 --> 16:43.440]  where we're in the ditch and every step he takes is a year older and bigger
[16:44.880 --> 16:48.160]  and by the time he gets to us we're in a lot of trouble
[16:49.920 --> 16:54.000]  and he's already gotten to us we're obsessed we're being programmed by the iphone's little
[16:54.000 --> 16:58.720]  computers that spy on us and track everything we do the grid's already gone in our houses
[16:58.720 --> 17:02.880]  we're already eating the gmo the chemicals are being added to our food we're being manipulated
[17:02.880 --> 17:11.040]  and controlled all on record they admit the entire plan and they think the public is so stupid
[17:11.040 --> 17:16.960]  we won't wake up to it and i'm going to tie all this in today
[17:19.280 --> 17:26.320]  with middle class decline looms over final years of obama presidency gotta get rid of that middle
[17:26.320 --> 17:33.520]  class their uppity they are a stepping stone for the poor to become lower middle class middle class
[17:34.800 --> 17:44.720]  upper middle class nuvo reach wealthy established so the great consolidation is now happening
[17:45.920 --> 17:52.800]  and it is the one tenth of one percent or roughly six thousand elitist and less than 20 families
[17:52.800 --> 17:59.840]  in henry kissinger's own organization's analysis superclass written by the head of the kissinger
[17:59.840 --> 18:05.520]  group at the time rothkopp and i agree with this analysis six thousand superclass we did the math
[18:05.520 --> 18:12.560]  it's something like zero zero zero zero zero zero was it point four two it's not one percent it's a
[18:12.560 --> 18:24.560]  fraction of one percent that is waging all out jihad all out crusade an all out holy war
[18:26.560 --> 18:32.960]  on any independent system the family any independent wealth anything private that you
[18:32.960 --> 18:43.040]  don't want known that's gotta be known this is a full domination a usurpation a conquering
[18:43.360 --> 18:48.560]  we face an organized scientific takeover that as i've said
[18:51.680 --> 18:53.920]  might as well be a deep space alien attack
[18:56.160 --> 19:02.400]  if i was an advanced species and i wanted to take over the planet and just kind of get rid of humans
[19:02.400 --> 19:06.800]  without wrecking everything in a big war if you friendly attacked seven billion people
[19:06.800 --> 19:10.480]  even if you had super advanced technology it'd care everything up with the humans fighting
[19:10.480 --> 19:16.240]  in their death threats but if you took them over this way with compromised leaders a they
[19:16.240 --> 19:21.920]  live scenario poison the water the food the culture get kids addicted to computers interfacing
[19:21.920 --> 19:28.560]  proto matrix into matrix uh the plan would actually work and i'm not saying it's deep
[19:28.560 --> 19:34.480]  space aliens like david ike saying everything interdimensional i'm not saying it's that it
[19:34.480 --> 19:39.440]  just might as well be that i mean that's what we're facing total extermination but first they're
[19:39.440 --> 19:44.800]  going to exterminate our minds our will because they have metaphysical rules they they are not
[19:44.800 --> 19:50.320]  allowed to kill a conscious human who hasn't joined their club or who hasn't agreed to their
[19:50.320 --> 19:54.160]  program it's a metaphysical rule they have to either get us to join them so we can be destroyed
[19:54.160 --> 19:58.800]  or just have us destroy ourselves through choices so we're no longer human then they can kill us
[20:00.160 --> 20:04.480]  what's the best way to keep secret for somebody why don't you give them something that they want

[24:44.400 --> 24:52.320]  they're quite public about their plan for you and i and let me just say it's not a very nice plan
[24:53.680 --> 24:57.920]  and i don't know why the average person gets violently angry if their neighbor's dog craps in
[24:57.920 --> 25:03.040]  their yard or if you catch the neighbor's teenager stealing a six pack of beer out of your garage
[25:06.160 --> 25:09.760]  i remember one time i had neighbors down the street whose dad's gotten a huge fist fight
[25:09.760 --> 25:14.880]  was one of the teenagers stole beer out of his garage the police came everything i look back on
[25:14.880 --> 25:21.520]  that would grown men fight when the globalist write books about how they put poison in the water

[25:33.360 --> 25:38.560]  i'm going to break down the real elite what their plan is how it ties into the middle class
[25:38.560 --> 25:44.400]  disappearing according to Reuters under obama we'll look at
[25:46.400 --> 25:52.640]  how that ties into this japan times article riches one percent will hold half of global wealth by
[25:52.640 --> 25:58.560]  2016 it's a tiny percentage of that that actually holds half the wealth and if you count all the
[25:58.560 --> 26:03.600]  derivatives well they hold a lot more than that so we're going to be breaking that down and tying
[26:03.600 --> 26:10.080]  it into a special report video up on info wars dot com by mark dies some americans think martin
[26:10.080 --> 26:18.960]  Luther king just died first african-american to walk on the moon remember angela merkel the
[26:19.680 --> 26:23.120]  deutsch chancellor

[26:33.520 --> 26:39.520]  list anti germans having to pay for all the welfare of the illegals uh germany is a
[26:40.720 --> 26:46.000]  first stop for criminals aggravated criminals around the world are allowed into germany
[26:46.000 --> 26:52.800]  by the socialists and organized into brigades to then become the social workers and rule over
[26:52.800 --> 26:57.120]  the germans who are too prideful to be basically government minions
[26:57.120 --> 27:08.160]  well german police ban anti islamic rowdy again german police ban anti islamic rally
[27:08.160 --> 27:15.200]  citing terror threat french news agency for your safety the nationalist groups not allowed to go

[27:28.480 --> 27:35.280]  ebdo when france and other countries are banning free speech under e you first it's don't deny the
[27:35.280 --> 27:42.240]  holocaust and sure that's unsavory but people should be allowed to deny it if they want to
[27:42.800 --> 27:48.320]  then now they're saying don't deny global warming well global warming is natural so it's cooling
[27:48.320 --> 27:53.360]  the only constant is change now they call it climate change if you deny that they want you
[27:53.360 --> 27:58.560]  arrested and fines are actually being levied in europe because they have a right in europe

[28:04.160 --> 28:09.920]  of the climate and so they're moving towards restricting free speech across the board and

[33:49.200 --> 33:55.120]  let's go ahead and go to a clip from august 28 1963 i have a dream martin luther king
[33:55.120 --> 34:00.000]  how different is this from what we see from the justice department in george soros spending 33
[34:00.000 --> 34:06.160]  million dollars to start race war and a war with the police in america i have a dream
[34:06.160 --> 34:16.400]  that one day this nation will rise up live out the true meaning of its creed
[34:17.680 --> 34:24.640]  we hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created each i have a dream
[34:24.640 --> 34:35.120]  that one day on the red hills of joy sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave on
[34:36.320 --> 34:43.520]  will they be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood i have a dream my four little
[34:43.520 --> 34:51.040]  children one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by
[34:51.040 --> 34:58.240]  the content of that character i have a dream that part was key
[35:03.680 --> 35:10.800]  i have a dream that one day every valley shall be exhausted every hill and mountain shall be made
[35:10.800 --> 35:16.240]  low the rough places will be made plain and the crooked places will be made straight and the
[35:16.240 --> 35:23.040]  poor of the lord shall be revealed in our life shall see it again well we shall overcome certainly
[35:23.040 --> 35:28.240]  hasn't happened yet and if you look at what the government has done wedding black women to the
[35:28.240 --> 35:37.680]  state blacks are obviously by every metric and every statistic worse off under the invisible
[35:38.560 --> 35:44.480]  or foggy tyranny of the great society than they were under the open tyranny of segregation
[35:44.480 --> 35:51.280]  and that oppressive system because an enemy and an attack that is open will make you strong
[35:52.400 --> 36:00.560]  an enemy that's creeping and and cold-blooded is the plague to paraphrase cicero the traitor is the
[36:00.560 --> 36:12.400]  plague and by every real metric health metrics family metrics economic metrics on average black
[36:12.400 --> 36:21.760]  people are worse off than they were in 1963 go look the numbers up it's incredible and under
[36:21.760 --> 36:28.400]  obama in just seven years double the unemployment rate you know who else is in trouble the middle
[36:28.400 --> 36:36.480]  class period no matter what color you are the american dream is in trouble more debt
[36:36.480 --> 36:46.320]  110 million people not in the workforce 47 million people on food stamps other 10 million
[36:46.320 --> 36:54.080]  or so on supplemental food stamps that's almost 60 million that's double and you don't want to
[36:54.080 --> 37:00.000]  blame obama but he's the figurehead for the dumb down public for new listeners that tune in that
[37:00.000 --> 37:04.560]  don't understand what's going on i got to say obama because then they know what i'm talking about
[37:04.560 --> 37:11.200]  i talk about shadow elite i talk about social engineers they've been conditioned that doesn't
[37:11.200 --> 37:18.960]  exist but let me tell you what's getting liberals attention when they get cut now under obama
[37:18.960 --> 37:24.480]  care from 40 hours to 25 hours that's happened more than 14 million people the last two years
[37:24.480 --> 37:30.720]  since that kicked in and now here's the headline obama care penalty may come as a shock at tax
[37:30.720 --> 37:38.080]  time washington times gonna garnish your wages gonna keep your tax for fun gonna grab your bank
[37:38.080 --> 37:44.640]  account remember they promised you that wasn't gonna happen and everybody said well why is the
[37:44.640 --> 37:50.400]  why is the irs the enforcer it's right here in the bill shut up racist well the public knows that
[37:50.400 --> 37:57.040]  word racist they don't know who martin luther king is now people don't know who chuck yeager is
[37:57.040 --> 38:00.880]  people don't know who george washington is i'm not kidding you see the different polls out every
[38:00.880 --> 38:05.440]  year from college students and high school students were you know 40 something percent can't name one
[38:05.440 --> 38:11.040]  founding father we're 70 something percent can't name the three branches of government i mean i mean
[38:11.040 --> 38:17.760]  the numbers vary but you've all seen those but let me tell you they can tell you who the quarterback is
[38:18.400 --> 38:24.720]  for the new england patrons if they're from florida they can tell you the quarterback is for the
[38:24.720 --> 38:31.680]  gators and those very same people on an elevator or or a restaurant will say hey how about that
[38:31.680 --> 38:35.760]  cowboy's game that was a bad bad call right and you know you're not really washed football
[38:35.760 --> 38:42.080]  you're some kind of idiot you don't know jack squad do you know i just know about the battle
[38:42.080 --> 38:47.040]  formations at the battle of waterloo i know about the rothschilds i know about them crashing
[38:47.040 --> 38:52.960]  the stock market taking over the brooch empire in 1815 and i know all about the charter the
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.120]  fellow reserve and i know all about proud house and the cfr and british intelligence and
[39:00.160 --> 39:03.680]  i've had intelligence agencies from foreign governments and domestic come and visit me
[39:04.320 --> 39:08.720]  i live in the real world see i don't live in football land sorry i'm not very manly
[39:11.440 --> 39:16.800]  i've just been visited by the massad and the cia and british intelligence and the fbi
[39:16.800 --> 39:23.600]  and the secret service and federal marshals i just break national news stories every week
[39:24.160 --> 39:30.320]  i am the most listened to radio broadcast at the pentagon and i'm not bragging about alex
[39:30.320 --> 39:38.320]  jones what i'm saying is i live in the real world ladies and gentlemen and the real world listens
[39:39.120 --> 39:42.640]  not that i'm even perfect or have all the answers but there's no other radio
[39:42.640 --> 39:47.200]  that even the establishment can tune into don't you think when you're an insider and know how
[39:47.200 --> 39:52.480]  things really work it gets old watching cnn or fox news don't you think it gets old
[39:53.120 --> 39:58.160]  seeing the twisting and not seeing representation of how stuff really works because that's how it
[39:58.160 --> 40:03.760]  really works you've got less than one tenth of one percent that really has half the wealth
[40:03.760 --> 40:08.480]  and they're waging war on the middle class and pushing higher taxes when they themselves are
[40:08.480 --> 40:12.000]  exempt from it and i'm going to break that down in a moment it's a fact
[40:15.520 --> 40:17.120]  they're pulling up the ladders
[40:20.720 --> 40:25.120]  that everybody could get up they've decided prosperity is not the way to go
[40:25.120 --> 40:31.200]  they've decided renaissance isn't the way to go they've decided dark age in fighting race war
[40:32.400 --> 40:37.760]  is the way to go they've decided totalitarian management is the way to go because the future
[40:37.760 --> 40:41.360]  doesn't need us and the elite have made the decision
[40:44.240 --> 40:48.480]  and so even though half of an american history textbook on average in public school
[40:48.480 --> 40:54.720]  is about wrongs done to minorities to make people guilty so they can then be guilty
[40:54.720 --> 40:59.200]  and do what democrats and republicans tell them to do or they'll be called racist it's all there
[40:59.200 --> 41:05.120]  with just dumb empty-headed kids white kids to feel guilty and minorities are the majority in
[41:05.120 --> 41:14.240]  most areas to then feel wrong and race conscious and hateful to bring in a new management system of
[41:14.240 --> 41:24.720]  racism quite a trick and to do that they've had to dumb down the public and they've done a fabulous
[41:24.720 --> 41:31.520]  job videos up on info wars dot com some americans think martin Luther king just died that he was
[41:31.520 --> 41:37.040]  the first african-american to walk on the moon almost three decades after americans first observed

[41:44.560 --> 41:48.480]  recently with others thinking king was the first african-american to walk on the moon
[41:49.680 --> 41:55.520]  king was murdered on april 4th 68 nearly 47 years ago but when media analyst and author
[41:55.520 --> 42:03.440]  mark dies confronted sandi agans with the news that he had just passed away the reaction
[42:04.880 --> 42:09.360]  was not as expected yes it was these are not cherry picked he's coming on we've talked to
[42:10.000 --> 42:13.600]  we don't need to cherry pick either it is shocking how dumb they are
[42:16.960 --> 42:23.200]  they signed a petition to add birth control drugs and the water supply students of the
[42:23.200 --> 42:28.720]  university california accepted abortion in a can fruit juice drinks endorsing 19th century
[42:28.720 --> 42:34.080]  communist ideologue carl marx is the president of the united states these are past videos

[43:23.280 --> 43:28.560]  grant obama immunity from all crimes he commits while in office in another video san diegans
[43:28.560 --> 43:34.080]  also expressed their view that not liking mexican food was racist form of bigotry see all they know
[43:34.960 --> 43:40.240]  white black ispanic asian is to hate white people even if they're white and to hate anything
[43:40.240 --> 43:47.360]  pro-life and to hate any form of freedom just like in germany that you are not allowed to go out
[43:47.360 --> 43:55.440]  in protest open borders anything else goes but free speech is banned while the president marches
[43:55.440 --> 44:07.280]  for a free speech so let's go ahead and go to this video of the san diego airheads thinking
[44:07.280 --> 44:11.120]  that martin wither king was the first black person to walk on the moon here it is as you

[45:22.080 --> 45:29.840]  african-american to be put on mount rushmore obviously a huge step in america uh and how much
[45:29.840 --> 45:35.760]  more do we have to go until we're you know i know i think a long ways but wouldn't you agree at least
[45:35.760 --> 45:40.400]  yes putting putting him i mean when they when they put him on the on the face of mount rushmore
[45:40.400 --> 45:46.240]  yes when they put martin wither king in the face of mount rushmore a huge step for american

[45:52.400 --> 46:00.960]  wither king huge legacy for america a favorite general in the confederate army giving the
[46:00.960 --> 46:08.000]  gettysburg address still played today any any thoughts on how close we are to finally
[46:08.880 --> 46:15.840]  achieving the dream of eradicating racism i have no idea i mean there's still stuff going on in
[46:15.840 --> 46:24.080]  different parts of the country like the whole what is that missouri thing the missouri thing the police
[46:24.080 --> 46:31.680]  shooting oh you know that whole mess i don't know i mean i think it's it's better than what it was
[46:31.680 --> 46:37.120]  so we'll see i guess i mean as you probably saw on the news i don't know if you saw the news in the
[46:37.120 --> 46:45.520]  last hour or so but martin wither king has passed away at the age of 93 and we're just i didn't see
[46:45.520 --> 46:50.320]  we're just sort of getting people's opinions and you know just sort of looking at the legacy that
[46:50.320 --> 46:59.120]  he's left behind here any thoughts on what he's done for the country how far we've come he passed
[46:59.120 --> 47:03.680]  away thoughts are that he was a good man and i'm sorry he's passed away because we should all follow
[47:03.680 --> 47:12.640]  what he preached i mean this you know we lost a great civil rights leader this morning martin
[47:12.640 --> 47:20.240]  wither king dead at 93 any any thoughts on how far we've come from his original speech
[47:22.400 --> 47:28.480]  we've come a ways but we have a long way to go i believe are you gonna be watching the funeral
[47:28.480 --> 47:34.640]  services or maybe attending i definitely won't be attending because funerals are very sad yeah
[47:34.640 --> 47:41.600]  but you won't go possibly king's funeral then no but maybe watch the memorial services on possibly
[47:42.800 --> 47:47.840]  i would imagine we'll all be watching because we won't have a choice the whole world will be
[47:47.840 --> 47:55.680]  watching yes martin wither king's funeral live on television right i mean as you as you probably saw
[47:55.680 --> 48:01.440]  in the news this morning martin wither king passed away so we're just getting people's opinions
[48:01.440 --> 48:10.640]  i don't know if that's true he was uh yeah dead at 93 and so just getting some sound bites on how far
[48:10.640 --> 48:18.640]  we've come to you know achieving the dream of eradicating racism eradicating racism well i'm

[48:49.760 --> 48:59.360]  we've got a clip from that famous speech back in 1963 on august 28th where he says
[48:59.920 --> 49:05.040]  judge people not on what color they are but on what they stand for basically now if you look at
[49:05.040 --> 49:10.800]  political correctness and you look at everything being about your sexual persuasion what color
[49:10.800 --> 49:16.400]  you are it's the opposite of a truly liberal society in a liberal society it's about what
[49:16.400 --> 49:21.280]  you stand for and who you are and you're open to new ideas and you're tolerant but it doesn't mean
[49:21.280 --> 49:26.480]  you put yourself in a group and then think as a group and operate as a group that's called a cult
[49:26.480 --> 49:33.760]  a gang driven society and george soros again it came out in a report last week we already told you
[49:33.760 --> 49:39.040]  this month ago but it's in a big washington's report he admits it 33 million just to get
[49:39.680 --> 49:44.640]  the anti-police stuff going folks the police ask it forward to seizures shooting homeless people
[49:44.640 --> 49:50.080]  they're bad cops out there a lot of bad training we fight all that but just hating the police in
[49:50.080 --> 49:55.760]  general why would george soros want that because they're beta testing civil war in this country
[49:55.760 --> 50:01.600]  soros just over through ukraine regardless what you think about ukraine and russia and europe
[50:01.600 --> 50:07.360]  soros admits he was behind that it's the same deal they want racial division in this country
[50:08.080 --> 50:12.320]  the public dumb down only looking at what color you are and that's what this is turned into
[50:12.320 --> 50:20.640]  here's martin luther king i have a dream my four little children one day live in a nation
[50:20.640 --> 50:26.000]  where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of that character

[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.840]  film but he certainly deserves an oscar uh it's just a little side issue
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:25.600]  clonies would fish full of dollars sniper the first weekend american sniper makes a hundred
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:31.360]  to five million and there's now a big controversy american sniper complaints grow in hollywood
[01:01:31.360 --> 01:01:38.480]  should clonies would be celebrating a killer you know that's not my issue humanizing a sniper in a
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:44.560]  war and i know people want to believe in chris kyle i've debated chris kyle repeatedly
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:50.080]  that we ought to grab that opening ante it was one other show i mean that was nice to him but
[01:01:50.080 --> 01:01:56.320]  i told him i said jet uh i said uh jesse viter is going to sue you
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:02:04.400]  you and you've already changed your story this is for jesse suiting i said you need to back off
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:08.560]  right now and admit it was a lie and said i'm not going to do that
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.560]  in fact i need to do a special report for the nightly news tonight
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:20.240]  in fact do just have it set up at the end of the show i'm going to shoot this
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:25.840]  don't do this properly i'm going to tie it in to private lynch and members of her team getting
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:30.080]  killed and then went public pat tillman and the major articles about it being a homicide
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:37.200]  when the army coroner broke ranks and i want to get some other examples of other military people
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:43.120]  who were used as pr fronts who didn't play ball so they killed him and i believe chris kyle was
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:51.920]  murdered i know people that know chris kyle in fact i have i have had some friends i'll just
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:55.280]  leave it at that i've known a very long time that are friends with chris kyle and one of them
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:03:01.920]  is polite but will not associate with me anymore basically because i sided with ventura so i'm
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:06.960]  right here in texas folks i've been involved in this up to my eyeballs so this is what i want for
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:13.600]  the nightly news get the clips off of opi and anthony when i was on there talking chris kyle
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:19.440]  it's on youtube alex jones you know talks chris kyle i think it's the name of it get a clip of
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:26.160]  that so so viewers know i'm not just saying this and then uh i want to show what looks like craft
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:32.000]  at the boston bombing i'm not saying craft was involved but it's the craft uniform the craft
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:36.880]  punisher hats with the blood and the cops are there taking their directions people say that
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:44.320]  could be anybody in punisher outfits directing the police running around black backpacks it's
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:50.560]  time i do a report on chris kyle i mean who else can i've been deeply involved in this from the
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:55.520]  beginning and i'm going to go see it it's been sold out i was going to go saturday night and no
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:04:01.920]  theater in town had it so i got tickets for wednesday night so i'll have a review for you
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:06.400]  but i've already read the book so i know what the film is and i've read the cheat sheet on it
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:15.440]  and it is a load of bull kyle even admitted in interviews that a lot of it was basically hype in
[01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:24.400]  the book um there were snipers in vietnam that killed 300 400 people they just couldn't confirm
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:30.800]  them all there were snipers in korea that may have killed up to 500 people um
[01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:38.560]  um but they can't confirm it because it was human wave attacks so he's just not america's most
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:44.960]  deadly sniper and a lot of what's in the book is a is a fairy tale jesse ventura doesn't drink jesse
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:50.400]  ventura doesn't go bad mouthing navy seals at the memorial at the events and he had it was all
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:56.000]  bull he lost the court case so that's justice and it was designed to destroy jesse ventura
[01:04:56.000 --> 01:05:03.760]  the government's department of homeland security is buying up loads of ammo at the same time
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:08.880]  the restricting civilians rights to own and purchase firearms can you put two and two together

[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:35.600]  argentinian prosecutor who accrues the president christina kerchner over 1994 bombings has been
[01:08:35.600 --> 01:08:42.960]  found dead alberto nisman who on monday was due in parliament to present his case against the
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:49.680]  president found dead days after warning i could end up dead because of this that's the london
[01:08:49.680 --> 01:08:59.600]  telegraph we also have it posted to info wars dot com afp is also carrying the report
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:07.200]  and they're already in that country's newspapers calling it a conspiracy theory
[01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:13.840]  if you question his death he's about to present to parliament bombshell evidence
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:21.040]  he says i could be found dead i'm being threatened he's found dead and you're not supposed to
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:28.560]  question that see that's the label conspiracy theorist it's just meant to not ask questions
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.120]  and to shut down any serious form of debate
[01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:42.560]  the prosecutor found that just hours before giving what was expected to be damning testimony
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:48.000]  be damning testimony against the president appears to have committed suicide the nation's
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  top security official said monday oh the nation's who do you think carried out the hit
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:04.400]  the people doing the investigation think so what do you think kills people for the president
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:13.840]  i'd give it a 99 chance oh i bet there's going to be a handwritten note there
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:17.680]  yeah let me tell you how that works fill this out we're going to blow your kid's head off
[01:10:19.360 --> 01:10:20.560]  when they get out of school today
[01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:27.360]  that's how they do it and you fill out your suicide note and they go okay make the right
[01:10:27.360 --> 01:10:34.320]  decision boom maybe you flinch when they pull the trigger so they shoot you a couple more times
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.720]  maybe you fight them there's been cases of that and they shoot you as you run down the street
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:45.200]  and of course there was gun control restrictions there so even as a prosecutor he had trouble
[01:10:45.200 --> 01:10:51.280]  having a gun but of course the security services they always have a gun whether it's nazi germany
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:57.680]  or soviet russia or mouse china because they know that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun
[01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:06.640]  on the nightly news tonight i will give you a my breakdown of the american sniper film
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:14.640]  i've read the cheat sheet of it i'm seeing it wednesday but i've already read online the complete
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:19.760]  basically transcript of the film it's the book that ventura sued over and won in court
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:24.880]  it is a fiction i know it feels good to go watch a great clonieswood movie i love clonieswood
[01:11:24.880 --> 01:11:32.640]  he's a great director it is a load of baloney he was not crying about shooting people he was not
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:38.960]  torn up about it my problem with clonieswood's film is that it's just not chris kyle make a movie
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:43.440]  that sounds obon guard where he goes they're all dirty savages i want to kill more of these animals
[01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:55.680]  i mean those are quotes two newspapers he became a security risk because the story was unraveling
[01:11:55.680 --> 01:12:02.400]  so how do you prop a story up this unraveling you kill the living hero to make him more sanctified
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:11.040]  as a martyr just like pat tilman the great nfl star killed battling al qaeda on a hill
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:18.400]  turned out he was murdered in cold blood begging for his life army's own report same story different
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:26.480]  man and pat tilman was a hero he gave up multi-million dollar ear contract went over there to fight
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:31.360]  with his brother found out it was all bull we were growing the drugs running all sorts of stuff
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:35.280]  working with al qaeda for a writing letter some to his family i've talked to his brother and it's
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:42.000]  come out in the news and they murdered him murdered him good they ought to make a movie about pat
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:49.680]  tilman and about how they murdered him that's a movie that deserves a Pulitzer prize for the
[01:12:49.680 --> 01:12:58.240]  for the article written on it and then a major oscar that's what clonieswood should be making
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:05.760]  all but clonieswood's been doing government propaganda since the 40s clonieswood gasses
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:14.320]  up his own car super hardcore conservative loves ronald reagan listens to ksco that we're on in
[01:13:14.320 --> 01:13:29.680]  the area there in california santa cruz old clonieswood who calls in on michael savages
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:38.640]  show there in san francisco so for a fact tunes into this show i don't even know what to say
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:45.680]  about that i guess you just believes america is just so good and so wonderful that even if
[01:13:45.680 --> 01:13:49.840]  they didn't true about chris kyle give everybody this great image i don't know why didn't just
[01:13:49.840 --> 01:13:58.320]  make a fiction film then see i said i would do this tonight because i want to go over all the
[01:13:58.320 --> 01:14:03.840]  evidence of them killing jessica lynch's team members because she'd hidden fear didn't shoot
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:10.400]  the iraqis and all that member private lynch all that bull and pat telman all that bull they kill
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:15.040]  people to keep these stories going and they no doubt kill chris kyle and that made up ps
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:22.000]  the p tsd story now that said let me get into this report
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:29.360]  middle class decline looms over final years of obama presidency
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:36.640]  reuters barack obama enters his final two years of the presidency with a blemish on the legacy
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:41.840]  that looks impossible to erase the decline of the middle class he has promised to rescue
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.760]  if he promises something you know it's the opposite he's eggs you zag
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.320]  the revival of middle class jobs has been one of obama's
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:58.320]  mantras since he took office in 09 fighting the worst economic crisis in generations it was a
[01:14:58.320 --> 01:15:02.960]  major theme of the last state of the union address as expected to feature in one of his
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:09.120]  scheduled for tomorrow administration official said on saturday the president would propose
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:15.600]  higher capital gains taxes new fees on large financial firms and other measures to raise 320
[01:15:15.600 --> 01:15:22.640]  million for programs and tax breaks aimed at the middle class yeah tax break raising taxes on somebody
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:30.960]  making 125 000 a year folks making 125 000 a year are the ones that buy cars go to the spa
[01:15:30.960 --> 01:15:37.200]  go on vacations give money to the pta i mean that is exactly what you want is a nation of people
[01:15:37.200 --> 01:15:45.040]  making that money who then get services but you raise taxes on them you created an economy where
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:50.240]  they couldn't make money and then it just goes on to say but for the middle class the scars of
[01:15:50.240 --> 01:15:55.760]  the recession still run deep see reuters is acting like oh obama tried to fix it but he couldn't
[01:15:55.760 --> 01:16:07.440]  but he's going to promise you one more time the number one enemy of the top 10 percent of the
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:14.320]  one percent the crony capitalists the insiders the goldman sacks of jp morgans they lobbied
[01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:18.000]  to raise taxes on the middle class because they end up getting that banker bailout money
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:25.040]  they want to shut down their competition they want a consolidated controlled command and control
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:31.440]  economy and the japan times has a report on this today riches one percent will hold half of global
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:38.560]  wealth in 2016 it's much worse than that and again it's not bad that they have wealth it's
[01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:43.120]  that they got it by controlled markets by rigging things by getting government bailouts
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:51.920]  by bid rigging by no bid contracts and when you look at who goldman sacks and jp morgan and
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:57.200]  berkshire half the way and all these groups who they donate to it's across the board take your
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:17:02.880]  guns pass obama care to rip you off and that's in this report that it's the insurance companies
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:09.520]  that grew the biggest for the billionaires off of us taxpayers i mean i mean you understand it's
[01:17:09.520 --> 01:17:14.720]  basically doubling and tripling health care already one seventh the economy when they're done
[01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:18.880]  they're gonna have it's gonna be like one fourth they're just taking everything over
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:25.760]  and then you're gonna get worse health care but the average liberal thinks martin luther king was
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:33.680]  the first man to walk on the moon they don't know what planet they're on you just say do this or
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:40.400]  you're racist and they say okay i'll do what you say that's all they know that's all they can do
[01:17:40.400 --> 01:17:45.600]  they're helpless they'll vote however they're told they'll vote to slit their own throats and they're
[01:17:45.600 --> 01:17:53.920]  told it's trendy and so the elite are getting rid of any competition right now they're sewing it up
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.680]  we're going to be third world all the way and the third world population black white
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:03.760]  Hispanic i don't care what color they are they've all got that dumbered in a box of rocks looking
[01:18:03.760 --> 01:18:10.240]  their eyes that stupid smile that self-satisfiedness that fools always have and their ignorance they
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:15.760]  believe the ultimate ace in the hole that trumps everything on earth ignorance is bliss they say
[01:18:15.760 --> 01:18:21.520]  yeah until you run into a ditch i'ma skip this network break because i gotta get this special
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:28.160]  report as well riches one percent will hold half of global wealth for the next year wealth
[01:18:28.160 --> 01:18:32.640]  accumulated by the riches one percent will exceed that of the other 99 percent the oxfam
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:37.040]  charity set on monday ahead of an annual meeting of the world's most powerful in davos switzerland
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:43.920]  and the very rich warren buffet ted turner george soros they're the ones calling for
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:50.880]  quote higher taxes on the rich but every time the real proposal gets there it's not tax any of
[01:18:50.880 --> 01:18:59.920]  their groups offshore that pays zero basically it's tax people making 100 000 a year it's
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:03.600]  raised payroll taxes on people making 20 000 a year that was an obama care
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:11.280]  but the poor have a lottery mentality on average where they're always looking to get rich somebody
[01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:16.880]  ran into me i'm going to get a settlement even though you're not really hurt or uh i'm going to
[01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:21.040]  win a lottery ticket and they just love hearing a president i'm going to give you a free house a free
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:25.280]  car and free health care and when you don't get it you're like well just give me another socialist
[01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:33.120]  they'll promise me wealth accumulated the scale of global inequity is quite simply staggering and
[01:19:33.120 --> 01:19:38.480]  they'll use that to bring in even more socialism see which they're exempt from and despite the
[01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:43.680]  issue shooting up the global agenda the gap between the riches and the rest is widening fast
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:51.200]  oxfam executive director winnie beigname said by butchering that correctly
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:58.560]  and then you continue here the richest one percent share of global wealth increased from
[01:19:58.560 --> 01:20:05.040]  44 percent in 2009 to 48 percent in 2014 the british charity said in report adding that it will
[01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:09.680]  be more than 50 percent by 2016 and then so on
[01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:17.600]  they use credit swiss global wealth report and the forms billionaires list
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:21.600]  one-fifth of global billionaires have interest in the financial and insurance sectors
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:27.760]  and saw their cash climb 11 percent in one year yeah just off the obama care screw job
[01:20:29.040 --> 01:20:34.720]  the oxfam brief says pharmaceutical and health care billionaires saw 47 percent
[01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:42.320]  bump in collective worth in one year again worldwide obama care type strategies it wasn't
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:48.960]  just done here they had to double triple prices tell you it's cheaper and the average person believes
[01:20:48.960 --> 01:20:54.720]  it because they're dumb i mean you know they know who all the football players are and how to stick
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:59.920]  their chest out walking around a grocery store and grunt at other men they probably wouldn't know
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:04.640]  what to do if somebody jumped on top of it started slamming their head in the ground though see it's
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:11.680]  all fake it's all hat no cattle it's all empty there's no bona fides
[01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:19.520]  they don't want to hear about how they got screwed over and neither does the middle class or the
[01:21:19.520 --> 01:21:24.480]  average doctor or lawyer but because you know what they they don't want to hear because it
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:28.240]  makes them feel like they're not number one they like to go pay a thousand dollars and be at a
[01:21:28.240 --> 01:21:31.520]  congressman's dinner and feel like they're part of the elite shakes the governor's hand
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:36.320]  see the middle class doesn't want to really be a middle class and doesn't want their kids to be at
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:42.480]  the top of the class because they just want to be in fantasy land and believe they're in control
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:48.080]  bless your soul you think you're in control to quote narles barkley
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:58.400]  i mean why do you think the insurance company spent over two billion dollars on record that we
[01:21:58.400 --> 01:22:07.120]  know of passing obama care why don't you think the republicans will repeal it john bainer alone
[01:22:07.120 --> 01:22:12.800]  is set to make more than five million dollars in just the next few years on his obama care
[01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:20.720]  investments in insurance companies pretty cheap huh they're making hundreds of billions old
[01:22:20.720 --> 01:22:27.200]  bainer makes a couple million extra and remember when congress got caught six seven years ago
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:33.520]  insider trading cbs news headline congress legalizes insider trading how about child molestation
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:41.440]  see this thing's all hidden in plain view ladies and gentlemen by the way the article is very
[01:22:41.440 --> 01:22:45.120]  informative because it's stuff we already told you but here it is in the japan times
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:51.520]  and they got it off of screwing you over with your health care that was already screwed up
[01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:54.960]  because they've been looting it for 30 years we had the best cheapest health care in the world
[01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:59.760]  by every metric 50 something years ago now we have some of the worst and then don't worry it's
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:04.480]  going to get worse and their new solutions will be even bigger screw jobs and the lottery ticket
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:10.800]  mentality of wanting to believe the rhetoric one more time and feel good and pick a candidate from
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:14.960]  the establishment and feel like you're winning you're going to go buy that stupid ticket you're
[01:23:14.960 --> 01:23:20.320]  going to do it over and over again oxfam is concerned that lobbying power of these sectors
[01:23:20.320 --> 01:23:25.360]  is a major barrier in way of reforming the global tax system the release says the group proposes a
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:30.160]  crackdown on corporate individual tax dodging is that why all over europe and the u.s and australia
[01:23:30.160 --> 01:23:34.560]  they've gotten rid of all the major billionaire white collar fraud investigators i mean they've
[01:23:34.560 --> 01:23:40.320]  gotten rid of all of them and only go after now blue collar in fact you can search the headline irs
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:47.920]  changes focus to blue collar workers the irs will spend 50 000 or more trying to get a thousand
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:55.840]  dollars out of some shoe repair shop in one article i saw at illinois we think you didn't pay a thousand
[01:23:55.840 --> 01:24:01.200]  dollars we think you kept cash we're going to have a huge trial and investigation to throw you in jail
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:09.760]  and take your shoe store you're not going to have lemonade stands or coffee stands you're not going
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:15.200]  to have unlicensed uh food trucks you're not going to have events where you can sell pumpkins on the
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:23.360]  side of the road or firewood no you don't do anything in the super max prison we're going to take
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:27.520]  your bank accounts with no judge no jury no trial because you made small deposits
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:34.240]  if you're ready illicitor i just put the new york times on screen saying that i'm not making
[01:24:34.240 --> 01:24:37.440]  this up oh and you think it's going to get worse you understand that
[01:24:40.480 --> 01:24:44.880]  oxham is concerned that the lobbying power of these sectors is a major barrier in the way of
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:49.040]  reforming the global tax system the release says the group proposes a crackdown on the
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:55.440]  corporate individual tax dodging more investment in free public services oh more free and a shift
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:25:02.400]  in taxes towards capital and wealth to help fix the problem they mean individual capital not part
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:06.800]  of the globalist organizations that have already been given diplomatic immunity by the un oxham
[01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:12.160]  called on states to tackle tax evasion just like the french have done up to 100 percent
[01:25:12.160 --> 01:25:18.960]  then the socialist are exempt improve public services tax capital rather than labor well that's
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:24.480]  the communist manifesto says tax labor but so you're not supposed to do that and introduce
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:30.720]  living minimum wages now that'll just cut people out of the workforce among there's other measures
[01:25:30.720 --> 01:25:36.000]  is a bid to ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth oh and the elites are all calling for
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:42.080]  that don't worry they're going to fix the problem they've engineered and the 45th world economic
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:47.040]  forum is coming up and they want carbon taxes to help the poorest well even though when you read
[01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:53.600]  the past proposals it's carbon taxes on the poorest to shut you down just like obama care
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:59.200]  increased your prices and and now all obama care is done is poor people
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:05.680]  think that they can now get free health care when they could always get charity care and they
[01:26:05.680 --> 01:26:10.240]  could always get in there and get it but now it's going to federal care through the insurance
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:15.120]  companies and the prices are just higher and so the hospitals are either making record profits
[01:26:15.120 --> 01:26:21.840]  if they're insiders or they're going bankrupt which is another consolidation and when they're
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.640]  done you'll pay five times what you did and then they're going to go right to eugenics care
[01:26:28.080 --> 01:26:33.920]  so that's how the insider scam works and the profits for the insurance companies and banks
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:42.320]  are up 40 plus percent just since obama care went in a year ago japan times from the devos group
[01:26:42.320 --> 01:26:50.800]  from the major reports there you go that's how it works and the middle class is all but disappearing
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:27:02.320]  let's now go to a report from this weekend up in dallas dfw area where joe begs jacari jackson went
[01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:12.560]  out to the respect prophet mohammed event to cover exactly what happened here is that report
[01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:20.400]  joe begs here with info wars dot com now we were standing outside of the curtis
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:26.240]  colwell convention center in garland texas just above dallas texas now today there's going to be
[01:27:26.240 --> 01:27:31.840]  a rally at five p.m the stand with the profit rally there's going to be a lot of controversial
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:37.680]  islamic speakers and imam from new york city that is coming here we first read in the washington
[01:27:37.680 --> 01:27:43.200]  free beacon article a few days ago that this was going to happen and i kind of had an idea that
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.360]  there would probably be some people in a small town like this in texas that are going to show up
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:53.520]  in protest this and as you can see back here there are hundreds of people lined up and down the road
[01:27:53.520 --> 01:28:01.200]  waving their american flags jewish flags a lot of people have the jesus uh charlie signs up from uh
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:06.400]  the attacks that happened in france and charlie hebdo what's your name i'm just a boy ronco nice
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:11.440]  to meet you so why are you out here today sir well it's a nice day number one and number two you
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:16.640]  know it's everybody's right to practice their religion and live their lives and kind of get along
[01:28:16.640 --> 01:28:23.680]  and so well so i heard that one of the main reasons of the rally was just kind of squash of a lot of
[01:28:23.680 --> 01:28:28.880]  the islamophobia that they say is created by the mainstream media do you believe the mainstream
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:35.600]  media hypes up this islamophobia i feel they're benefiting from that industry yeah and how so
[01:28:36.320 --> 01:28:41.840]  well it keeps people making money now what do you think about the uh the charlie hebdo attacks
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:48.400]  i think it was a tragedy so in any kind of way do you condone anything like that whatsoever because
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:55.600]  a lot of people think no i don't condone any killing of anybody and you support freedom of speech right
[01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:00.320]  yes right and so you have no problem with the other side as well coming out here to speak their
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:05.200]  minds and all that as long as no one forces their religion on you and you don't do it to them
[01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:10.800]  everyone's fine and dandy right exactly i like the idea the bikers going around you know making
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:15.040]  their harleys all nice and loud and it's cool now what do you think about one of the people
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:19.360]  that were going to come out here to speak today uh they said that one of the men the imam from new
[01:29:19.360 --> 01:29:24.480]  york had possible ties and i don't think he was ever indicted but the 93 bombings of the world
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:28.320]  trade center what do you think about someone like that coming in here and speaking don't you think
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:33.600]  that's going to have some kind of a a sour look no i don't because he's he's i've attended a high
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:39.040]  school graduation two years ago where he was the keynote speaker folks we're going to come back with
[01:29:39.040 --> 01:29:43.680]  the conclusion of joe begs report and we're going to talk to mark dice we got joe begs in studio to

[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:08.960]  more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside this toxic indoor air

[01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:23.920]  there are more than 42 million smokers in the united states well over a thousand types of mold

[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:22.720]  resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:30.160]  all right i saw a lot of mainline conservative news websites last week claiming that there
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:38.080]  was going to be a terrorist rally uh in garland a suburb of dallas texas in northeast texas
[01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:43.840]  where i grew up basically garland's one of my old stomping grounds and so we sent joe biggs
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:50.080]  and jacari jackson up there they did a great job and to show how balkanized things are we got called
[01:33:50.080 --> 01:33:57.840]  islamophobes for sending people up there to cover it and then once they got there i've debriefed joey's
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:34:02.800]  about to talk about it live on air then we're going to go to uh mark dice in a moment to cover some
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:09.280]  other ignorance as soon as they left the rally against i guess mohammed you could call it
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:14.400]  and to go over to cover the other side people booed them and yelled and called them
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:22.800]  you know fags and stuff like that basic pejoratives that's what went on it was very infantile from
[01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:31.520]  the video i've seen basically white trash on parade that said there is radical islam that's
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:36.320]  being politically protected and allowed to operate but they started the conference off
[01:34:36.320 --> 01:34:40.080]  and chose going to break this down condemning everything that happened with the charlie ebdo
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:45.920]  event uh basically what we'd been told and what we heard was not true about the rally and we just
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:51.120]  went to find out what was happening we just try to cover the truth of what's unfolding
[01:34:52.880 --> 01:34:57.120]  and this is the clash of civilizations that the social engineers want and that they're
[01:34:57.120 --> 01:35:02.320]  manipulating to play us off against each other on the other hand they've banned free speech in
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:07.520]  germany and critic criticizing islam and the german police have banned anti islamic rally
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:12.320]  citing terror threat so see oh there's a terror threat you can't assemble oh there's a terror
[01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:16.800]  threat you can't have a concert there's a terror threat you can't fly or we've got a naked body
[01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:23.600]  scan you know we don't give in to the threat we're a free open society imagine if there were real
[01:35:23.600 --> 01:35:29.120]  terror attacks in this country how many rights they'd take you get 20 dead at the ebdo attack
[01:35:29.120 --> 01:35:33.840]  we're talking about getting rid of free speech period and internet censorship and they've introduced
[01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:40.880]  sopa and syspa again sopa at the federal level syspa internationally we told you that was coming
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:45.040]  merkel's out there marching for free speech while she's banning it in germany
[01:35:46.880 --> 01:35:51.680]  so it's outrageous uh joe biggs joins us our martin luther king dead to talk about free speech i
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:56.160]  guess i just spend a few minutes i also noticed they had the sheriff's department and their camo
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:36:02.000]  there and more inside the building we've got more reports coming out tonight of what you've
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:06.800]  actually shot inside but joe give people your breakdown of what happened when i got there i
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.360]  didn't know what to expect on the drive up there jacar and i were kind of like at a loss for what
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:16.960]  we you know what we were going to expect when we got there i was reading some uh the twitter feeds
[01:36:16.960 --> 01:36:21.680]  and they said at this point in time we're about 30 minutes out they said there were hundreds of people
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:26.000]  already out there protesting at this point in time so we're like all right this this could be
[01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:30.560]  interesting and as we pulled up to the uh the convention center hundreds of people lying both
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:35.040]  sides of the road tons of motorcycles driving up and down the road people waving american flags
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:41.600]  jewish flags you know screaming god bless america sharia law doesn't belong here mohammed was a
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:47.120]  homosexual and a pedophile blah blah blah so we park behind the protesters and we go around and start
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:52.400]  talking to some people and uh one guy goes oh yeah info wars uh glad you guys came out here
[01:36:52.400 --> 01:36:55.920]  and i was like what do you mind if i talk to you sir and he goes yeah yeah that's fine i was like
[01:36:55.920 --> 01:37:01.040]  so why are you out here sir and he goes well i'm out here for freedom of speech and i said well
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:06.400]  okay so do you have a problem with the stand for the profit rally that's happening next door across
[01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:09.680]  the street i should say well yeah yeah i don't think they should be over there i don't think they
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:16.480]  should be allowed to talk to to anything like that whatsoever so that was just the aspect of people
[01:37:17.040 --> 01:37:25.280]  the entire time that they were just ignorant about everything they were just out of their mind like
[01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:32.160]  we were standing there behind the protesters and by the time we went over to where the actual
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:36.400]  event was people started booing us people started calling us names people started uh
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:42.000]  uh you know saying you guys should go to iraq and see what it's like you know and so we finally get
[01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.200]  over to the other side and we get out of the vehicle and i'm watching some of these protesters
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:49.840]  that are at the entrance of the uh the drive to come into the convention center and there's a
[01:37:49.840 --> 01:37:54.720]  muslim guy walks by this guy screams oh look he's got a beard there's probably a bomb in that beard
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:38:00.080]  they hide him everywhere they're shifty you know and it was just like out of this world so it was
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:05.280]  like they were trying to get cast for deliverance yeah i mean that's what was that and i don't want
[01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:09.440]  to knock our listener it was out there people get angry i've been mean at protests as well you get
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:16.080]  in an angry mode they had probably read the news articles claiming that this event because i remember
[01:38:16.080 --> 01:38:20.160]  reading these going is this accurate some of these are pretty big news outlets that you're claiming
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:24.160]  that terrorists were there yeah and then as you said you went and investigated that wasn't the case
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:29.760]  so i think it was the disinformation that hyped them into getting mad so i'm not calling the whole
[01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:33.840]  group you know white trash rednecks because i'm kind of redneck myself the point is some of the
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:39.280]  smartest folks i know is what you call a redneck you know wise folks it's just that you're saying
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.520]  that there was that flavor to some of the people yeah exactly and you know when we got into the
[01:38:43.520 --> 01:38:49.360]  rally they started the uh the rally off inside they had a prayer and then they opened up they said
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:55.840]  we do not uh condone any acts of violence we condemn the attacks of charlie ebdo we condemn
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:39:01.520]  boko haram we condemn isis these are not people of islam they do not follow the prophet Muhammad
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:07.920]  they these are people who take you know 18 20-year-old young men who are angry and you know piss off at
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:14.960]  the world and use them and mold their minds into this radical did they let you film that uh no we
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:19.200]  had to sign a consent form couldn't film you can film some of them but not in in that one area
[01:39:19.200 --> 01:39:25.360]  that's so stupid because you think they they need to get that out there because a lot of muslim groups
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:30.640]  will not condemn it they need to they should have condemned it publicly well there was an american flag
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:35.760]  in a texas flag everyone had little american flag in a texas flag each person had one it was all
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:40.000]  there was hundreds of muslims in there and they all were waving them up in the air you know and
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:44.160]  they kept calling themselves muslim americans so i noticed a drone was out there too yeah there was
[01:39:44.160 --> 01:39:48.640]  a drone out there flying around but i mean nowadays i mean everyone can go buy one at a hobby store so
[01:39:48.640 --> 01:39:54.560]  i mean it didn't have any identifiable more police won't have lights on it yeah but there was tons
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:57.920]  there was a huge police presence they had those little towers you know they jack up that you can
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:03.360]  see in walmart parking lots now they had those all over the place and then we saw like you saw the
[01:40:03.920 --> 01:40:09.840]  militarized looking police from like ferguson standing in the window watching on as well
[01:40:09.840 --> 01:40:13.680]  these guys came out that you can see right here they came out to pray and they wanted to do it in
[01:40:13.680 --> 01:40:18.240]  front of everyone to show that they're being peaceful and you know they don't mean any harm
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:21.600]  they just want to be a part of the community and one of the other things i thought was interesting
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:26.800]  as well uh one of the keynote speakers came up and he says i'm thankful that i can live in a country
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:32.080]  where freedom of speech is protected where i'm allowed to come out and have a rally to help
[01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:37.440]  bring awareness to what it is we're trying to do to be a peaceful part of the uh
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:44.240]  society in garland well that's what the dutch mayor who's a muslim said is if you don't appreciate
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:47.840]  freedom of speech and everything you should get out of the country well the same thing goes for
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:53.440]  murkel not just radical muslims what do you think of them banning even mainline political parties
[01:40:53.440 --> 01:40:59.680]  protesting against open borders and the forced importation of tens of millions of muslims
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:04.320]  to create malconization by the left them banning free speech i mean even if you don't agree with
[01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:09.280]  these groups they should have free speech yeah exactly i mean even if i don't agree with what the
[01:41:09.280 --> 01:41:14.960]  the other side saying i still i'm so glad i live in a country where they're able to have that opinion
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:19.520]  they're able to voice it without being persecuted you know in a sense so i mean i think it's great
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:24.720]  that we live in this kind of country but some americans need to understand what freedom of speech
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:28.800]  is and i'll tell you for everyone i agree i don't want to make a big deal out of this because i don't
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:32.960]  like to end fight but if you can go re-pull me the articles that were claiming that this guy's a
[01:41:32.960 --> 01:41:38.560]  terrorist that guy's a terrorist i want to look at those when i get off air today because that's
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:43.440]  dangerous for people to say known terrorists are at this event to stir up people well yeah that's
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:49.440]  what they were saying yeah i know i know and you know it's fun to hype up the muslim threat and
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:53.280]  everything i understand people like to do that but this is all part of this divide and conquer
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:57.680]  strategy and i think the borders are too open we are bringing radical muslims in i'm against it
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:42:01.520]  they they're being allowed to fly around they're being allowed to recruit they're being allowed to
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:08.880]  train i say go after them because that's training for military attacks clearly illegal but the attempt
[01:42:08.880 --> 01:42:13.680]  to just let them attack and then create a fight with general muslims is part of a larger plan it's
[01:42:13.680 --> 01:42:19.280]  like yeah there are bad cops out there they should be punished but don't let george soros fund
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:25.520]  33 million to start a war on police that's meant to start civil unrest that's so obvious i mean we
[01:42:25.520 --> 01:42:28.640]  said that back at the time that george soros was behind it because we tracked the name of the grips
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:33.200]  but what do you make of it coming out that he admits that he's behind the anti-police stuff
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:38.320]  that's pretty obvious yeah i mean that's mind-blowing to see all this i mean because you see people now
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:42.800]  i mean there's i've been following some stuff in jacksville florida they've been popping shots off
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:47.760]  at police officers fire departments doing drive-bys i mean it's happening all over the place because
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:52.400]  of this cop phobia that's not happening they you know all police are bad that they're saying
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:56.560]  i mean a few bad apples out there but if you look at the the amount of police officers
[01:42:56.560 --> 01:43:02.000]  and the tens of thousands of calls they go on they do pretty positive stuff well the the globalist
[01:43:02.000 --> 01:43:05.680]  want to federalize them and turn them into paramilitary force that hates the public show the
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:10.960]  globalist are funding idiots to attack them so so the cops go into that psychology yeah and call
[01:43:10.960 --> 01:43:17.520]  it a war zone this is the plan and soros admits it it's illegal what he's doing i guarantee if i
[01:43:17.520 --> 01:43:22.160]  was funding 33 million and stirring up groups to go say deck the halls with dead cops i get arrested
[01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:27.280]  and i should soros is above the law because he runs the white house the white house is doing this
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:32.640]  the white house is running it joe biggs thank you he's with us till five minutes in the next hour
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:37.360]  and then we're going to be joined by the food babe got her new book out some really positive
[01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:42.720]  news on food freedom one of the main fronts we can still have an effect but i played this already
[01:43:43.440 --> 01:43:51.920]  at the start of the last hour and that is the powerful video up on info wars dot com americans
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:59.200]  think martin luther king just died or was a confederate general or was the first african-american
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:04.160]  to walk on the moon i'm not going to play the whole video again it's on info wars dot com
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:10.560]  these are not cherry picked i want to get into this with mark dice on martin luther king day
[01:44:10.560 --> 01:44:16.080]  mark dice dot com he's an author and media critic his new books out inside the illuminati will tell
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:20.720]  you something about that as well or having back up in a few weeks to a whole hour on the true history
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:26.160]  of the illuminati's and a lot of research into it but mark uh first off shifting gears back to what
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:33.440]  we just covered a few minutes with us on the clash of civilizations uh the radical islamics that
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:40.480]  are being brought in what do you make of this overall and george soros's attempt to basically
[01:44:40.480 --> 01:44:48.480]  fund um destabilization and ultimately attacks on police and private property well it's the classic
[01:44:48.480 --> 01:44:54.400]  plan of the clash of civilizations to pit different groups against each other basically to tap into
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:45:00.720]  the most primitive aspect of humanity's tribalism and with the martin luther king video that you
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:06.160]  showed that you were talking about earlier i just again wanted to continue to demonstrate how people
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:12.000]  are so ignorant and will believe just about anything that you tell them and if i can walk up to people
[01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:19.680]  and state fake facts and get people to comment on them and not have a light bulb go off in their head
[01:45:19.680 --> 01:45:24.560]  just imagine and we've seen it demonstrated for years what the mainstream media is able to do with
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:30.480]  their men in suits and what their uh professional music and what their hundred thousand dollar sets
[01:45:30.480 --> 01:45:38.560]  and this is a demonstration of why the public is so easily manipulated by the television it simply
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:45.920]  tells them what to do what to believe uh their rational processes have become so dumbed down
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:50.480]  you know that if somebody has an injury if they break a bone in their arm or leg is in a cast for
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:55.920]  six or eight weeks when it's out it's very atrophied that's unfortunately what has happened to most
[01:45:55.920 --> 01:46:01.520]  americans minds i mean they're literally not using them the smartphone use the obsession with the
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:08.240]  internet uh the short-term thinking processes have basically been short-circuited not dumping data
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:13.440]  into long-term memory and by the way all the research studies that you're talking about show
[01:46:13.440 --> 01:46:17.680]  that you're not just making claims here uh people are disassociating they're becoming
[01:46:17.680 --> 01:46:23.040]  basically zombies uh and and and you're not out there because we've talked about this before
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:29.600]  to make yourself look smart and make them look dumb or cherry picking uh you're out there showing
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:36.480]  really what you ran into and just how much danger we're in because quite frankly it is liberals
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:41.920]  we found this in austin if you go to a conservative area they're pretty informed they're pretty smart
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:49.200]  compared to these people well so-called liberals are the but they always think they're real smart
[01:46:49.200 --> 01:46:54.560]  and msnbc makes fun of dumb conservatives all day who certainly exist i'm not conservative or liberal
[01:46:54.560 --> 01:47:02.640]  i'm into just freedom libertarian but this phenomenon of liberals being dumber than a lobotomized
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:09.120]  turkey or something i uh they're a very scary group because they will vote however they're
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:13.760]  told to that's why i'm demonstrating you know and i'm glad a few years ago some of your crew came
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:19.040]  out and we did a video together and and they were probably stunned to see just how easy it was not
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:25.120]  only for me to demonstrate people signing the petitions for absurd legislation just stating a
[01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:29.920]  fact a fake fact that uh you tell them it's for their own good they'll sign the petition to repeal
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:35.680]  the bill of rights just complete insane ideas your camera crew got to see it my camera men are
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:40.160]  absolutely stunned and you know we're talking earlier in the show about the power of television
[01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:46.240]  one of the most famous media analysts is a man named neil postman who wrote a book in the 1980s
[01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:53.360]  called amusing ourselves to death still captures the state of the american media today when he says
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:58.000]  that under the governance of the printing press discourse in america was different from what
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:04.640]  it is now generally coherent serious and rational and then how under the governance of television
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:10.400]  it has become shriveled and absurd and he goes on to say that we have part of the reason for this
[01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:17.120]  is because we've been accustomed to its discontinuities so that we are no longer struck dumb as any
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:22.800]  sane person would be by a newscaster who having just reported that a nuclear war was inevitable
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:28.320]  goes on to say that we'll be right back after this word from burger king and one can hardly
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:36.160]  overestimate the damage that this just a position does to our sense of the world as a serious place
[01:48:36.160 --> 01:48:41.920]  he goes on to say that they keep everything brief not to strain our attention but to provide
[01:48:41.920 --> 01:48:48.000]  constant stimulation through variety novelty action and movement you are required to pay
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:54.880]  attention to no concept no character and no problem for more than a few seconds at a time
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:02.960]  that bite size is best the complexity must be avoided nuances are dispensable and that qualifications
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:10.080]  impede a simple message and visual stimulation is a substitute for thoughts that's right it's
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:14.480]  dumbed down to republican democrat black white you're the four the cops you're against the cops
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:22.400]  they want us all like automatons with no subtlety no qualifications no deep understanding of history
[01:49:22.400 --> 01:49:30.240]  until the general public are like dumb animals it's so sad they're so stupid but they're also
[01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.960]  so vicious they'll vote to take our guns in a minute they'll vote to put us in a fema camp
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.880]  you've gone out and had long discussions with liberals going yeah we're going to put
[01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:42.880]  the gun owners in forced labor camps and they're like oh good yeah i don't like them
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:48.000]  and these people are ready mark to come take us on our families i mean these are idiotic i mean we
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:54.160]  have a generation of people who grew up on smartphones literally don't know by memory that the phone
[01:49:54.160 --> 01:50:00.640]  numbers of their friends or their families i mean most people under perhaps 30 25 remember before
[01:50:00.640 --> 01:50:05.360]  smartphones when you would actually memorize the phone numbers of your family and of your friends but
[01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:09.680]  now people as you know just plug them into their phone if they lost their phone if their phone battery
[01:50:09.680 --> 01:50:14.080]  died they would be so lost they literally wouldn't know where they are they don't know how to go
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:19.920]  anywhere without gps and you know martin wither king the video that we were talking about and
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:25.040]  and what he's done for this country is just still historic speech that rings true today
[01:50:25.760 --> 01:50:31.600]  this is also an important day to highlight as you know the co-intel pro program the fbis

[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:01.440]  coming in after the state of the union after jacari jackson david night
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:06.800]  leon macadoo give commentary during it and then coming in at the end

[01:55:15.600 --> 01:55:18.560]  i just like to step aside and let them grow which they've really been doing
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:24.480]  they have a night does a wonderful job when he hosts the show so that's coming up going back to
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:30.320]  mark dice mark i mean martin luther king said don't judge people on their color judge them on
[01:55:30.320 --> 01:55:34.080]  what they stand for i don't care what color you are if i like your music i don't care what color
[01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:37.600]  you are if i like your restaurant i'm gonna come eat there i mean that's what that's what free
[01:55:37.600 --> 01:55:42.480]  markets really all about free market of ideas free market of choice that's real diversity
[01:55:43.120 --> 01:55:47.440]  is that you're not hung up on what color somebody is so you know you got a friend who's whatever
[01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:52.880]  you know go see a movie together or whatever but now political correctness is just the opposite
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:57.440]  it's all about what color you are and how you're a special group you're protected the opposite of
[01:55:57.440 --> 01:56:04.480]  what martin luther king said and now we know why the fbi left malcolm x alone when he was saying
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:10.000]  kill everybody but as soon as he said no uh all races should work together that's when he got killed
[01:56:10.640 --> 01:56:15.840]  and it really shows the system wants this divide and conquer so spend a few minutes on uh coantel
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.720]  probe yeah i mean the general public would just think this is a conspiracy theory but i mean we
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:25.760]  know it's been declassified that the fbi had and of course continues to have despite their claims
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:30.880]  that they ended the program and apologized for it but they were infiltrating and harassing
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:37.440]  committing all sorts of illegal crimes and uh to discredit disrupt and neutralize
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:43.520]  peaceful groups particularly martin luther king and the civil rights movement or anybody
[01:56:43.520 --> 01:56:47.680]  who was or continues to be because he didn't want to burn down the country because he didn't want to
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:53.680]  anyone but meanwhile violent groups are being supported and meanwhile george soros is pushing

[01:57:14.240 --> 01:57:19.600]  figure any musician john lennon he wouldn't have him deported because he was such a powerful
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:26.160]  anti-war spokesman in face against the vietnam war again that was an establishment program
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:30.320]  and they finally shut him down just like the argentinian prosecutor hours before he was going

[02:00:49.920 --> 02:00:55.280]  banks when they're told to and that's just an ancient system they have there's a lot of high
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:01:00.160]  tech drugs and things that are perfect for mind control sir hand sir hand was on these when he
[02:01:00.800 --> 02:01:06.640]  was the decoy in the shooting of rfk but going back to mark dies mark tell us about
[02:01:06.640 --> 02:01:13.600]  devil's breath and just an example of how easy it is to mind control someone now we know the power
[02:01:13.600 --> 02:01:19.360]  of suggestion my video series demonstrates just from me repeatedly telling people to print their
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:25.840]  name and pointing on the crazy petitions to disrupt their thought patterns to direct them to what i
[02:01:25.840 --> 02:01:31.040]  want them to do using really a form of neuro linguistic programming in a sense that is quite
[02:01:31.040 --> 02:01:36.720]  powerful in and of itself but you add drugs into the mix and this scopolamine it's a very little
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:43.200]  known drug nicknamed the devil's breath often rumored to just be a conspiracy theory again but
[02:01:43.200 --> 02:01:49.120]  confirmed to be a real substance that of course the cia has experimented and used in their now
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:55.840]  declassified mk ultra mind control programs which literally turns a person into a a conscious
[02:01:55.840 --> 02:02:01.760]  zombie where they too an uninformed person appear to be uh fully conscious and aware of
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:07.760]  themselves and their surroundings but they are essentially turned into a hypnotic slave and
[02:02:07.760 --> 02:02:12.080]  there's been many cases of individuals not even associated with the government just organized
[02:02:12.080 --> 02:02:17.840]  criminals or rogue criminal elements using scopolamine devil's breath uh to then get
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:22.320]  people to go and empty out their bank accounts because they will walk into a bank after being
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:26.800]  told to an empty out their bank account or their atm or they'll just let them into their house and
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:32.080]  tell them uh you know just give them some of their jewels etc this is one of the most sophisticated
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:39.600]  damaging types of a mind control drug but you mix this in with sophisticated uh hypnotic techniques
[02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:44.960]  trained and neuro linguistic programmers and these individuals that the intelligence agencies
[02:02:44.960 --> 02:02:49.760]  can literally almost uh turn somebody into a mind controlled slave and have them do
[02:02:49.760 --> 02:02:55.040]  whatever it is they want to the the television of course is is really one of the biggest
[02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:59.920]  hypnotic tools and you know we always talk about they control the media or trying to get more
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:06.160]  detailed the establishment but as a media analyst i mean i can tell you that there's an entire division
[02:03:06.160 --> 02:03:11.440]  in the entertainment industry that literally works and you know this with the department of defense
[02:03:11.440 --> 02:03:17.760]  there's on the cia's website uh there is a whole page about the entertainment liaison office that
[02:03:17.760 --> 02:03:22.640]  works hand in hand with hollywood to create these propaganda films like this new number one film
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:30.000]  american sniper this new war propaganda infomercial about chris kyle who again as you know lost his
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:36.560]  libel suit uh or jesse ventura won 1.8 million dollars confirming in a court that it fabricated
[02:03:36.560 --> 02:03:41.840]  his tale about allegedly punching out jesse ventura so we're living in an in a mind control
[02:03:41.840 --> 02:03:48.640]  idiocracy wasteland where the public just does what the television tells them to uh we have multiple

[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:35.280]  using again it's just an easy form of neurolinguistic programming the power of suggestion interrupt their

[02:08:28.800 --> 02:08:33.680]  there's a lot of breaking news at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com we're gonna get to it
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:40.800]  about 45 after after our guest leaves us there's also a new story or two that i didn't get to friday
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:46.320]  that i've got to get to the minute i saw this friday morning holder had made the announcement
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:50.560]  the night before the attorney general who was supposed to be gone six months ago because of
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:58.400]  fast and furious and all his other activities the irs persecuting people the minute i saw it
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:02.880]  on television while i was on the elliptical i knew what the body would be because i just know
[02:09:02.880 --> 02:09:08.240]  their tactics and sure enough i went up got the new york times and here it was
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:13.840]  it's the feds that got acid forward to seizure laws passed federally to begin with that the
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:20.640]  states then copied 40 years ago they run the war on drugs and also ship the drugs in on record
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:27.760]  so i knew that the feds lobbied states to get rid of their asset forward to seizure systems in
[02:09:27.760 --> 02:09:34.640]  the last 10 years showing cases of corrupt police robbing people in non crime related events
[02:09:35.680 --> 02:09:42.160]  as a pretext to get rid of the state programs so they could then have police see stuff but go
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:47.360]  through the federal program to get up to 85 percent of the money back thus federalizing police
[02:09:48.560 --> 02:09:51.840]  and the goal is federalized police i'm showing you how my thought process works
[02:09:51.840 --> 02:09:58.080]  so i waddle back from the gym go pull up what the attorney general actually did
[02:09:58.880 --> 02:10:02.880]  what he said in his statement because it's open ended and it was exactly what i thought
[02:10:03.920 --> 02:10:08.240]  and i'm not bragging that i'm smart i'm saying they follow a criminal program
[02:10:10.720 --> 02:10:17.360]  it goes on to say that it has to be um firearms or ammunition or explosives
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:24.160]  or they won't accept it and then give them money back the corvettes or houses or whatever
[02:10:24.160 --> 02:10:30.400]  they're stealing so now they're going to asset forward to siege for guns they claim are illegal
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:34.720]  you know if somebody in the house is a felon and they're your guns they're going to say it's
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:38.880]  the felons gun to take your house i mean this is this is this is their anti gun initiative
[02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:45.600]  they said they do it so holder to use asset forward to seizure to go after guns that's the
[02:10:45.600 --> 02:10:52.880]  real headline but then it goes on now here's the real key the new policy notice it's a policy
[02:10:54.160 --> 02:10:59.040]  not a law it's how they interpret it just like the justice department told the irs five years ago
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:06.160]  if somebody makes more than 14 in a year look it up less than a thousand dollar
[02:11:08.000 --> 02:11:13.600]  deposits in their bank account that's structuring and you can take their bank account no charges
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:16.640]  in fact show the new york times on that folks won't believe me
[02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:24.080]  in fact in some cases as little as 10 deposits in a year they would do it
[02:11:26.080 --> 02:11:30.800]  well the woman for 40 something years owned a tiny diner never made more than a thousand
[02:11:30.800 --> 02:11:36.080]  dollars deposited her money paid tax on it in america that's not good enough because the
[02:11:36.080 --> 02:11:43.760]  policy says obama has a policy to shut down power plants a policy to teach your five-year-old
[02:11:43.760 --> 02:11:48.880]  how to wear a dress your five-year-old boy they have a policy to teach kids how to masturbate
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:56.960]  since you jostle on elders there's no law it's a policy well here it is the new policy does not
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:12:03.840]  affect asset seizures made under joint state and federal operations and local law enforcement may
[02:12:03.840 --> 02:12:11.040]  still seize property under state laws which have been changed so see when you know the law and you
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:18.720]  read this it's a joke so what they're saying is you got to be totally federalized or you can't
[02:12:18.720 --> 02:12:25.920]  have asset for which a seizure or guns will will let you in our program say it's okay to take somebody's
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:31.600]  house or car oh you have an illegal gun you know this this this receiver is improper under our
[02:12:31.600 --> 02:12:42.320]  regulations we're going to take your car it's like the cases in new york where the cops it
[02:12:42.320 --> 02:12:47.520]  turned out were running the hookers but they were still taking people's cars that they were busting
[02:12:47.520 --> 02:12:51.760]  they would just randomly bust people that had nice cars because they wanted to take the car too
[02:12:51.760 --> 02:12:56.640]  it's like it's not enough you paid the cops for the hooker they were pimping now the cop gets your car
[02:12:56.640 --> 02:13:05.040]  too remember the dc cops got caught this this was in the washington post i couldn't believe it when
[02:13:05.040 --> 02:13:10.240]  i read it like 10 years ago coeing cars from mcdonald's parking lots that were parked legally
[02:13:10.240 --> 02:13:18.400]  in uniform on duty and the cops owned their own tow truck company and people would come out and say
[02:13:18.400 --> 02:13:22.400]  hey man you're you're taking my car i'm parked legally the cops would pull guns on them that's
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:30.080]  who needs to be indicted this is the general corruption though of the society that we've
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:35.120]  let happen look in the mirror this is our fault so see oh holders doing something about asset
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:42.880]  forms of seizure oh isn't he nice it's the feds that offered authored this form of piracy
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:53.520]  holder limits seized assets sharing process that split billions of local state police
[02:13:55.280 --> 02:13:59.040]  all right enough of that i've got so much other news i haven't gotten to yet we're
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:04.080]  going to cover it all but joining us and guys you hand me her buckets over there on that table

[02:14:55.760 --> 02:14:58.720]  but i wanted to get her on top of her book but also some of the news
[02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:06.800]  out there we have a story on info wars dot com don't worry us da says pesticide laden food is safe
[02:15:06.800 --> 02:15:12.320]  to eat eps determine the extremely low levels of those residues are not a food safety risk just
[02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:16.000]  like they think fluoride's okay even though the majority of their scientists have gone public
[02:15:16.000 --> 02:15:20.720]  saying it's deadly and then it goes into the fact that they're even using fluoride as a
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:27.600]  pesticide and the epa should take it out four years ago but it still hasn't been done so we're
[02:15:27.600 --> 02:15:31.520]  going to talk about that we're going to get into her latest project she's been very successful
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:36.880]  thanks to listeners of this show and other folks getting involved this frito lay organic product
[02:15:36.880 --> 02:15:44.160]  sent shockwaves through me help get it everywhere is the headline she'll break down what that means
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:49.440]  from her website food babe dot com so food babe great to have you on with us we'll get into the
[02:15:49.440 --> 02:15:54.320]  book some but let's get into this frito lay situation first yeah absolutely thank you so
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:16:01.200]  much for having me i'm excited to be back um so a few months ago i was traveling i was in california
[02:16:01.200 --> 02:16:05.600]  great state of california so many acts that you know we have there's so much access to
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:12.400]  organic food there and i walked into a cosco and i was touring it and i was looking around and i tell
[02:16:12.400 --> 02:16:18.720]  you i freaking flipped out when i saw this product when i actually have it here today because i i took
[02:16:18.720 --> 02:16:27.200]  it with me but it's an organic bag of frito lay this is like the first organic certified product
[02:16:27.200 --> 02:16:35.120]  that frito lay has put about and the only reason i was able to find this is because some unsung heroes
[02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:42.240]  are working at cosco internally to get these types of products to their members which is unheard of
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:49.520]  considering the amount of money is influenced that pepsicoe who owns frito lay has spent
[02:16:50.720 --> 02:16:56.960]  against our right to know has spent over eight million dollars preventing americans from knowing
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:17:02.640]  what's in our food and also preventing transparency even though they provide the same transparency
[02:17:02.640 --> 02:17:09.120]  to over 65 other countries and citizens across the globe so this is a company that specializes in
[02:17:09.120 --> 02:17:15.600]  junk food they they produce pepsi cola they produce a lot of chips and so for to see this
[02:17:15.600 --> 02:17:24.000]  organic product for the first time in my life there it was a brink of hope it gave me a really um
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:31.040]  warm fuzzy feeling inside like wow we can even change these giant companies that i spend all day
[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:36.800]  you know talking to people not to buy and now they're coming out with organic products and why
[02:17:36.800 --> 02:17:44.240]  this is so important is is for a couple reasons first of all going from conventional farming
[02:17:44.240 --> 02:17:53.280]  conventional potatoes to organic potatoes makes a significant impact on the environment
[02:17:53.280 --> 02:18:00.000]  number one it produces more sustainable farming so the farmers who deal with these toxic pesticides
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:06.640]  that they put on conventional potatoes go away the synthetic pesticides go away the environmental
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:12.800]  working group has stated that there can be 35 different types of synthetic pesticides found
[02:18:12.800 --> 02:18:19.360]  on a typical potato and potatoes actually retain the most amount of pesticides per weight out of
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:26.240]  any other fruit and vegetable so think about that 35 different pesticides many of them linked to
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:33.360]  being a carcinogen being endocrine disruptors being linked to fertility issues all sorts of problems
[02:18:33.360 --> 02:18:39.600]  and potatoes are one of the number one crop that people eat in this country i mean chips are a way
[02:18:39.600 --> 02:18:43.920]  of life whether they're healthy or not or whether they're organic or not people are going to eat
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:50.000]  chips as part of our culture we've got Super Bowl coming up and so that's why when i saw this product
[02:18:50.000 --> 02:18:57.280]  available at Posco but not anywhere else i felt like it was my mission to tell people about it
[02:18:57.280 --> 02:19:04.240]  but also to tell people that you know what we should ask Frito Lay to produce this everywhere
[02:19:04.240 --> 02:19:10.000]  they should be requiring their conventional farms to move over to organic and start producing
[02:19:10.000 --> 02:19:15.280]  organic potato chips for everyone absolutely it'd be a big hit i mean i was in a restaurant you see
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:21.920]  it in stores organic Heinz they're advertising it non-gmo so what they're doing is they're fighting
[02:19:22.880 --> 02:19:29.520]  from their competition labeling while they selectively move to beta test the market and now we have
[02:19:29.520 --> 02:19:36.080]  Chuck Norris we're going to break but Chuck Norris has come out against Monsanto and we'll cover
[02:19:36.080 --> 02:19:40.320]  some of that when we come back and that's good because they want to keep it a liberal
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:46.320]  conservative issue where conservatives are for guns liberals are against GMO well no i mean
[02:19:46.320 --> 02:19:51.040]  Chuck Norris doesn't want to die he didn't want his kids eating pesticides he knows that the Monsanto
[02:19:51.040 --> 02:19:56.640]  BT's killing honeybees Chuck Norris is a health expert he looks like he's 20 years younger than he
[02:19:56.640 --> 02:20:02.720]  is and he's smart silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic and only one system allows

[02:24:21.200 --> 02:24:29.120]  vani harry the food babe is our guest and i mentioned chuck norris he's been critical of gmo's
[02:24:29.120 --> 02:24:36.080]  before and he's a big conservative leader writing for world net daily frustrated over health risk
[02:24:36.080 --> 02:24:43.520]  from world's most popular weed killer and he goes on to break down glyphosate and what it's
[02:24:43.520 --> 02:24:51.440]  being used in and how 180 million pounds of glyphosate are being used uh basically every
[02:24:51.440 --> 02:24:57.280]  few years on the crops that was in 2007 the latest numbers we have was 185 million pounds
[02:24:57.920 --> 02:25:04.800]  and he just goes through what it does and it's a major endocrine disruptor it's they admit it
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:11.760]  gives women breast cancer so every time i go to a store not every time but all the time a restaurant

[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:34.320]  that's what grows the breast tumors sir you don't care about women we know what's causing it why
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:40.960]  should i go give money to find a cure the cure is don't get it to begin with glyphosate basically
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:46.720]  will destroy your prostate your testicles you think i want cancer you think you want my kids having
[02:25:46.720 --> 02:25:56.000]  cancer this is not a partisan issue it's crazy monsanto's the agent orange folks the dioxin people
[02:25:57.760 --> 02:26:02.560]  and they can lobby government to authorize whatever they want i'm ranting this is a short
[02:26:02.560 --> 02:26:07.920]  segment vani how big a deal is it to have chuck norris and others i mean i really see the momentum
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:14.480]  against this whole toxic industry turning up they're striking back but as you said all over the world
[02:26:14.480 --> 02:26:19.920]  they're banning the stuff or restricting it or labeling it here we seem to be the dumping ground
[02:26:19.920 --> 02:26:25.840]  of everything horrible you know it really is and you know this potato issue is really at the heart
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:31.280]  of that because we consume so many potatoes let me just give you an example 80 of the world's
[02:26:31.280 --> 02:26:38.480]  conventional or the united states conventional potatoes contains this bud night bud nip herbicide
[02:26:38.480 --> 02:26:43.120]  and what that does is it prevents that little sprouting from occurring in your potatoes you know
[02:26:43.120 --> 02:26:46.960]  you buy organic potatoes so you see when you leave them on the counter for a really long time they
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:51.280]  start to sprout well they're supposed to sprout because it tells you that they're bad you need to
[02:26:51.280 --> 02:26:56.560]  buy some new ones but they're actually putting this chemical on potatoes to make them last longer
[02:26:56.560 --> 02:27:02.160]  and this chemical is linked to all sorts of health issues according to animal studies and
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:07.280]  that's why it's so important to require these people that have figured out how to make organic
[02:27:07.280 --> 02:27:13.360]  potato chips the biggest manufacturer in the world to do this and people can sign this letter that
[02:27:13.360 --> 02:27:19.280]  i sent to the ceo of pepsi and the ceo of frito lay today this morning at foodbabe.com slash frito
[02:27:19.280 --> 02:27:24.400]  lay send your letter along with me post it through their facebook page go to their twitter accounts
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:30.000]  ask for this is it will make a huge difference in the amount of glyphosate the amount of herbicides
[02:27:30.000 --> 02:27:34.240]  the amount of pesticides the amount of fungicides that are in our environment and that's why i'm
[02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:39.840]  doing this action but one other thing you mentioned alex that's so important is that government
[02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:45.680]  regulation that that people are lobbying the government to do certain things that are harmful
[02:27:45.680 --> 02:27:50.720]  to americans and harmful to our environment and one in particular issue that i just highlighted
[02:27:50.720 --> 02:27:55.360]  very recently on the blog post is red number three now this doesn't have anything to do
[02:27:55.360 --> 02:28:01.600]  with pesticides this is actually a chemical made out of petroleum but red number three was banned
[02:28:01.600 --> 02:28:08.240]  in cosmetics and because the maraschino cherry industry was upset about it back several years
[02:28:08.240 --> 02:28:15.040]  ago over 20 years ago they wrote some legislation when they were banning that chemical in cosmetics
[02:28:15.040 --> 02:28:21.280]  and in food they wrote some legislation to be accepted in food and to have more studies involved
[02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:26.480]  even though it was already linked to cancer and animal studies and this red number three can be
[02:28:26.480 --> 02:28:32.400]  found all over the grocery store i'm talking about another PepsiCo product right here quaker and grits
[02:28:32.400 --> 02:28:37.680]  this red number three that's banned in lip sticking cosmetics is in people's grits that they're
[02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:42.880]  eating for breakfast and for folks who don't know it has been positively in so many studies directly
[02:28:42.880 --> 02:28:47.440]  linked to behavioral problems in children it has from my research correct me if i'm wrong i know it's
[02:28:47.440 --> 02:28:54.720]  red five as well has an impediment type effect yeah absolutely it causes hyperactivity it affects
[02:28:54.720 --> 02:28:59.920]  brain function they've they've shown that it's linked to uh can be contaminated with carcinogens
[02:28:59.920 --> 02:29:05.520]  the way it's produced i mean this is also in in just about every salad bar across america you'll
[02:29:05.520 --> 02:29:11.280]  see bacon bits on the salad bar this is red number three that's what makes these bacon bits this is
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:16.400]  also what makes the fake bacon that you get at morning so it's a kellobs product right here red
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:20.960]  number three in the fake bacon people think they go vegan and vegetarian get healthy they eat this
[02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:27.840]  this says 36 percent less fat only 60 calories we're getting toxic toxins and toxic listen i've
[02:29:27.840 --> 02:29:32.720]  learned if i eat those bacon bits years ago i'd get a headache i mean it's simple anything processed
[02:29:32.720 --> 02:29:39.840]  i get sick because it's chemicals petrochemicals in the mcdonald's nuggets on record is plastic
[02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:44.480]  they're allowed to do it well i don't want kidney failure folks i'm not eating it this isn't a game

[02:37:30.320 --> 02:37:34.560]  absolutely so one of the things you mentioned alex is that a lot of these chemicals in our
[02:37:34.560 --> 02:37:40.000]  food are toxins they're going to cause health issues cancer diabetes heart disease uh kidney
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:45.920]  failure you know um one of the ingredients and i know you talk about this a lot is artificial
[02:37:45.920 --> 02:37:50.480]  sweeteners and one of the things that people don't realize and products that they give to their
[02:37:50.480 --> 02:37:56.000]  children contain these artificial sweeteners even though they already have other kind of
[02:37:56.000 --> 02:38:00.720]  sweeteners like high fruit toast corn syrup or a type of sugar or something else and that
[02:38:00.720 --> 02:38:06.240]  product right here is the pills berry toaster strudels these actually have artificial sweetener
[02:38:06.240 --> 02:38:11.920]  sucralose aka splenda that's now linked to leukemia that caused the center of science and public
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:17.360]  interest to deem it as an unsafe ingredient in our food and you know that's not something you want
[02:38:17.360 --> 02:38:23.440]  to be given to your kids along those same lines pop tarts so popular big kellobs products it's
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:30.640]  still being sold everywhere it has tbhq tbhq is a derivative of butane this is the ingredient
[02:38:30.640 --> 02:38:35.760]  that lobby chick-fil-a to remove from their food which they did because they did see that consumers
[02:38:35.760 --> 02:38:40.720]  didn't want it in their food anymore and that ingredient also can be found in these other
[02:38:40.720 --> 02:38:45.840]  products over here but this one also is very alarming this is a weight control oatmeal from
[02:38:45.840 --> 02:38:51.280]  quaker oats you think this would be really healthy but it's not actually has artificial food dyes and
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:56.720]  also has that sucralose ingredient that's linked to a leukemia this is not oatmeal we want to be
[02:38:56.720 --> 02:39:03.440]  consuming as a as a as a merit as a society to lose weight and this brings me to my last one
[02:39:03.440 --> 02:39:08.720]  all of these chemicals we talked about today the pesticides the artificial food dyes all of the
[02:39:08.720 --> 02:39:14.800]  different chemical concoctions we're putting in our bodies are creating what we call obesogens in

[02:41:52.160 --> 02:41:57.600]  feel better just by getting off the fast food briefly recap that yeah absolutely you know
[02:41:57.600 --> 02:42:03.360]  for most of my life alex i grew up on industrial processed food i ate the fast food my parents
[02:42:03.360 --> 02:42:07.760]  were both from india they didn't know how to cook american they wanted us to fit in with everybody
[02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:13.120]  else so they let us eat the burger king i had my birthday party at burger king we went to mcdonald's
[02:42:13.120 --> 02:42:17.200]  and we filled out those little colorings and got the free breakfast for father's day and mother's
[02:42:17.200 --> 02:42:23.200]  day we lived our life my aunt worked at mcdonald's and we would go and visit her while i was little
[02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:28.720]  and i tell you i ate fast food i didn't eat much and anything really truly healthy until much later
[02:42:28.720 --> 02:42:35.120]  in my life and as a result i lived a very zombie like lifestyle i never felt well i had stomach
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:40.560]  issues i always had like a cloudy brain you know i was smart because i think i had good genes from
[02:42:40.560 --> 02:42:46.560]  two amazing parents but i tell you i really did not feel well i didn't look well i had eggs in
[02:42:46.560 --> 02:42:53.360]  all over my face i had asthma and then in my early 20s had a horrible appendicitis episode where i
[02:42:53.360 --> 02:42:57.760]  almost didn't get treated for it and if it hadn't been for my parents six cents to tell me to go
[02:42:57.760 --> 02:43:03.680]  see another doctor i might have died because that appendix was about to explode in my body and i had
[02:43:03.680 --> 02:43:07.680]  to get it taken out immediately the next morning after visiting an emergency room doctor that told
[02:43:07.680 --> 02:43:13.120]  me that nothing was wrong so it was a really life changing moment and then even a year after that
[02:43:13.120 --> 02:43:18.080]  something i don't talk about often alex is that you know i had endometriosis so i've been in and
[02:43:18.080 --> 02:43:23.840]  out of the medical system my whole entire life and at that moment i just decided you know what
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:29.120]  this is not how i want to live i'm in my early 20s i look horrible i feel horrible i want to
[02:43:29.120 --> 02:43:34.080]  take back control of my health and so i started using my research skills that i learned in debate
[02:43:34.080 --> 02:43:39.200]  in high school where i was a top tier brain debater and i started reading books at the library started
[02:43:39.200 --> 02:43:43.920]  looking through the microfiche and looking through journals and reading the best books on nutrition
[02:43:43.920 --> 02:43:49.120]  and teaching myself how to eat nutritionally and what i found out about the food industry
[02:43:49.760 --> 02:43:57.360]  in my search for that has never left me the same and so that's why i've made it my mission in life
[02:43:57.360 --> 02:44:04.720]  to tell people about what's in their food very well said i really am trying to adopt this for
[02:44:04.720 --> 02:44:12.080]  myself because children fall after their parents example and i've seen dramatic changes but the
[02:44:12.080 --> 02:44:17.840]  younger you start the easier it is but it's so simple folks when you're on these toxic foods
[02:44:19.120 --> 02:44:23.680]  these companies the last hundred years figured out that they could take petrochemicals basically
[02:44:23.680 --> 02:44:30.640]  make drugs call them additives that they would then be very addictive most poisons are addictive
[02:44:30.640 --> 02:44:37.440]  and then people would be branded to the weird additives that were in particular food just like
[02:44:37.440 --> 02:44:44.560]  cigarettes have hundreds of additives in them and really the scientists were there to figure out
[02:44:44.560 --> 02:44:49.360]  how to make it more addictive and how to make you smoke more and they were able to put incredible
[02:44:49.360 --> 02:44:55.520]  poisons in there well it's the same thing with food this is weaponized and this stuff all got
[02:44:55.520 --> 02:45:01.520]  invented in germany england in the u.s. the last hundred years and now we're trying to make it out
[02:45:01.520 --> 02:45:06.960]  of it but you can look at all the numbers all the neurological disorders the cancer people's skin
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:13.280]  everything and then they put fluoride in the water sodium fluoride hydrofluorosalic acid
[02:45:14.240 --> 02:45:22.480]  which harvard admits lowers IQ and gives you cancer pancreatic cancer liver cancer bladder
[02:45:22.480 --> 02:45:31.760]  cancer sevenfold increase in bone cancer in men a major thyroid problems in women that's why women
[02:45:31.760 --> 02:45:36.400]  that most scientists believe have off the chart thyroid problems is that it fills the thyroid
[02:45:36.400 --> 02:45:42.720]  and the women can't even get iodine so this is a plan and i know food babe you like to stick
[02:45:42.720 --> 02:45:47.200]  with what you can prove but if you get into the eugenics and the secret programs a lot of this
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:54.480]  is now public the fact that government in america lets companies do this but other governments won't
[02:45:55.600 --> 02:46:01.200]  you know japan and india banned Gardasil when it starts killing women we don't foreign countries banned
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:07.600]  fluoride we won't i mean what is it about america in closing that you think all this is allowed
[02:46:08.800 --> 02:46:14.480]  it's about the bottom line alex it's america baby it's about the bottom line and i'll tell you
[02:46:14.480 --> 02:46:20.480]  and i'll tell you you know it is so sad that our government cannot regulate our food anymore the fact
[02:46:20.480 --> 02:46:25.680]  that michael taylor admitted the deputy commissioner of the FDA admitted that he doesn't have the know
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:31.120]  how to know how many chemicals were being exposed to or even regulate them the fact that food companies
[02:46:31.120 --> 02:46:36.480]  themselves can improve their own ingredients generally regarded as safe i mean the food
[02:46:36.480 --> 02:46:42.400]  companies themselves doing self regulation the companies that are set to profit on these chemicals
[02:46:42.400 --> 02:46:48.640]  making their uh food less expensive for them that has got to stop and that's why it's absolutely
[02:46:48.640 --> 02:46:54.720]  important for us americans to find out what's in our food understand it and say no to it if there's
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:59.520]  health issues associate with it you know this food that we've been eating for the last 30 years is
[02:46:59.520 --> 02:47:07.840]  all new it's it's invented food it did not exist several years ago and we this is a massive experiment
[02:47:07.840 --> 02:47:13.120]  on our bodies and i know when i decided to opt out of that experience and that experiment
[02:47:13.920 --> 02:47:18.880]  my body changed for the better and i can't sit back and let people walk around like zombies like
[02:47:18.880 --> 02:47:24.720]  i used to i have to tell people what's going on that's right we are battling the zombie apocalypse
[02:47:24.720 --> 02:47:31.120]  and we are reaching out to people that laugh at us and that stare up from their pot mark faces
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:37.120]  with their glazed eyes with you know yellow in them from all the liver damage and giggle at us
[02:47:37.120 --> 02:47:43.280]  they've been pre-programmed to do it that's all they know how to do it's a defense mechanism
[02:47:43.280 --> 02:47:48.400]  because deep down they feel so powerless and so pathetic they just act secure they act like
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:52.640]  they're powerful they act like they you know know what they're doing and laugh at us you got to get
[02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:59.040]  through that first layer of defense and reach out to these poor people that really are modern
[02:47:59.040 --> 02:48:05.280]  food concentration camp victims in a giant eugenics operation uh truth is stranger than fiction
[02:48:05.280 --> 02:48:09.760]  food babe dot com vani harry thank you so much look forward to talking to you when the book
[02:48:09.760 --> 02:48:15.120]  officially comes out and we have it in the shopping cart at info wars store dot com thank you so much
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:21.040]  thank you there goes vani harry ladies and gentlemen you know what we just did for the
[02:48:21.040 --> 02:48:28.160]  last 40 minutes we listened to a woman and gee i was brought up where women knew how to shoot guns
[02:48:28.160 --> 02:48:34.720]  but they also wore dresses because dresses were pretty and they put lipstick on because it was
[02:48:34.720 --> 02:48:44.880]  pretty but where they knew how to change tires so i i i didn't grow up in a family where you just
[02:48:44.880 --> 02:48:50.960]  look at men and women and and and then say you know men do this women do that but at the same
[02:48:50.960 --> 02:48:56.400]  time there are traditional roles that women and men enjoy being in because that's what we do
[02:48:56.400 --> 02:49:01.280]  genetically but the system wants to act like the fact that men and women are different
[02:49:02.080 --> 02:49:05.440]  like we're at war with each other and that's all part of the balkanization
[02:49:06.640 --> 02:49:13.040]  and men are arrested development jerks many other women are self-centered tarts in many cases
[02:49:14.000 --> 02:49:21.760]  god love them but this pope you know i don't get involved in religious stuff uh
[02:49:21.760 --> 02:49:27.360]  uh in fighting and things and i have a lot of catholic friends and they've done a lot of great
[02:49:27.360 --> 02:49:34.880]  work for pro-life this new pope is basically the opposite of the last one so one of them's right
[02:49:34.880 --> 02:49:40.560]  one of them's wrong right for the faithful out there who are catholics this guy sounds like uh
[02:49:40.560 --> 02:49:48.320]  brock obama uh he's anti-gun he's come out for a u n gun treaty he's uh once carbon taxes
[02:49:48.320 --> 02:49:53.760]  uh global government he's come out and said god hates when we hurt the earth
[02:49:55.920 --> 02:50:01.200]  just i mean could you come out against monsanto like chuck norris did could you how about god said
[02:50:01.200 --> 02:50:07.440]  don't mix the seed genetic engineering how about you come out against pepsico using fetal tissue
[02:50:07.440 --> 02:50:13.200]  for their flavor uh testing oh no we're not going to hear that we're gonna hear just these
[02:50:13.200 --> 02:50:19.680]  vague things but listen it gets better the pope has now come out and said listen to women more
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:28.000]  don't be macho pope tells men wonderful well let me give men a little newsflash if you actually
[02:50:28.000 --> 02:50:33.440]  believe this women want not guys that are fake macho but men that are men and aren't gonna be
[02:50:33.440 --> 02:50:38.320]  pushed around women don't like men they can push around all day so go ahead and take the popes
[02:50:38.320 --> 02:50:43.040]  advice because men have already stopped being men see the government's run by a bunch of corrupt men
[02:50:43.040 --> 02:50:47.360]  and they don't want men to stand up against them they want to roll in and take over the families
[02:50:47.360 --> 02:50:52.800]  and take over the women and take the women's babies and use them for Pepsi flavoring so you
[02:50:52.800 --> 02:50:58.000]  know what pope you just go ahead and put your advice out i'll put mine out how's that sound

[02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:05.120]  he's the t-rex of political talk alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:54:12.880 --> 02:54:20.080]  my point about listening to a woman is the condescension of men listen to women
[02:54:20.080 --> 02:54:27.280]  well if a woman's got something good to say that makes sense it's taking action
[02:54:27.280 --> 02:54:34.000]  and leading a fight i'll listen i'll get behind them i'll get behind a man i get behind ideas
[02:54:34.000 --> 02:54:41.360]  like martin Luther king said what people stand for the character that it's always listen because
[02:54:41.360 --> 02:54:48.640]  they're a woman or support obama care for black people when it's a big screw job it's the dumbing
[02:54:48.640 --> 02:54:56.480]  down listen it's like it's the condescension listen to women more don't be bad of the earth
[02:54:56.480 --> 02:55:07.680]  pay carbon taxes my children don't be macho i don't know men are already pretty castrated
[02:55:07.680 --> 02:55:11.600]  how about the pope calls for men to just have their wavos chopped off how about that
[02:55:12.960 --> 02:55:17.920]  the catholic church could put on a free surgery on top of all the illegals they're pumping into
[02:55:17.920 --> 02:55:27.200]  the country and just just and just you know that's the end of it i mean that's all i'm saying is that
[02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:35.040]  i we got two years of barack obama now but it seems like we got like 10 years or whatever of
[02:55:35.040 --> 02:55:41.840]  barack senior here that's a conspiracy theory is the pope really obama's father since we don't know who
[02:55:41.840 --> 02:55:50.720]  i was about to make a really bad joke i'm not gonna do it i'm just getting tired of it i'm
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:56:00.480]  getting tired of it and i'm gonna tell you what's coming next here because we can barely hold back
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:06.160]  the globalists right now in their total global takeover if 1.2 billion catholics start supporting
[02:56:06.160 --> 02:56:13.680]  carbon taxes and gun control and open borders we're done i don't know maybe i should just
[02:56:16.480 --> 02:56:24.480]  join with the pope that's right listen to women and carbon fail gore money and turn your guns in
[02:56:25.680 --> 02:56:30.720]  but of course the pope's not going to have his secret police turn their guns in oh no no no no no
[02:56:30.720 --> 02:56:41.360]  no no no no no no no what is good for the pontiff is not good when he's pontificating he pontificates
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:53.520]  to us so do as he says not as he does i don't want to really end the transmission with this it just
[02:56:53.520 --> 02:57:01.360]  makes me want to throw up sometimes look at this headline school says students throw away 85 percent
[02:57:01.360 --> 02:57:07.120]  of vegetables served in healthy lunches maybe that's because they taste absolutely terrible
[02:57:09.360 --> 02:57:12.720]  you know it really is just our decadence at the end of the day that's causing all of this
[02:57:16.560 --> 02:57:20.880]  i just know a lot of positive things are happening at the same time so it's negative
[02:57:20.880 --> 02:57:24.960]  as a lot of things can get a lot of really great things are happening at the same time
[02:57:24.960 --> 02:57:30.880]  there is a big awakening when we vote with our dollars like with organic food we can change
[02:57:30.880 --> 02:57:36.160]  the world we vote with our dollars supporting candidates that are supporting freedom and when
[02:57:36.160 --> 02:57:44.640]  we vote with our mouths saying no to garbage and not being cult followers of any president
[02:57:44.640 --> 02:57:52.080]  or any prime minister or any pop star or any religious leader when we actually follow what
[02:57:52.080 --> 02:57:57.760]  jesus christ had to say do on to others as you'd have done under you that's when things will really
[02:57:57.760 --> 02:58:03.920]  start changing and i'm not up here on some high horse i'm not up here speaking to somebody that's
[02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:10.480]  got all the answers or is perfect i just know corruption is set in and as a culture as a society
[02:58:10.480 --> 02:58:18.000]  little people need to get involved and take action because little people are the solution and when
[02:58:18.000 --> 02:58:24.880]  they move nothing on earth can stop them and if the establishment's pushing something you better
