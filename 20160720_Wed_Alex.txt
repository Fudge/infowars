[00:00.000 --> 00:20.720]  big brother mainstream media government cover us you want to stop tyranny well so
[00:20.720 --> 00:37.560]  does he ladies and gentlemen he is now officially the nominee I'm going to be
[00:37.560 --> 00:42.360]  inside the convention center this evening and of course tomorrow one of the
[00:42.360 --> 00:46.520]  big international news stories is the fact that some communists ran over to me
[00:46.520 --> 00:51.720]  and started pushing and shoving me on the sides and one of them slapped me in
[00:51.720 --> 00:55.120]  the back of the head I'm not even sure who says when I had tried to push over a
[00:55.120 --> 00:59.840]  few of them and then ran into the police chief that's basically what happened
[00:59.840 --> 01:05.000]  but the police were there and then the crowd started trying part of the crowd
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.000]  about half the folks there were info warriors started trying to attack the
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.120]  police the police had to use bikes to basically one cop that I saw video of
[01:14.120 --> 01:19.280]  us holding back six of the communist protesters himself and Gawker and others
[01:19.280 --> 01:22.280]  just to illustrate not that Gawker matters you know they're going under
[01:22.280 --> 01:26.320]  according to reports of the whole Hulk Hogan thing Gawker just loves to
[01:26.320 --> 01:30.240]  distort reality I was reading this piece this morning and it said that it was
[01:30.240 --> 01:33.720]  classic that I'm this anti-government person and here I am with the police
[01:33.720 --> 01:39.960]  helping and there I was battling real anarchist no people with red flags want
[01:39.960 --> 01:44.400]  total government and I'm sick and tired of communists calling themselves anarchist
[01:44.400 --> 01:48.280]  okay just because I don't want a big giant government and I want lower taxes
[01:48.280 --> 01:52.440]  doesn't mean I hate the local police or I want to shoot them in the back of the
[01:52.440 --> 02:00.680]  head that's the globalist run left that's destabilizing the nation not us so
[02:00.680 --> 02:05.280]  they're always trying to act like we're not genuine we're not real we're not no
[02:05.280 --> 02:11.160]  we're genuine Americana you know what we stand for Americana freedom lower taxes
[02:11.160 --> 02:15.960]  being left alone being able to defend yourself being able to practice the
[02:15.960 --> 02:19.200]  religion or not practice the religion of your choice not having to go to Sharia
[02:19.200 --> 02:25.440]  law that's who we are we're called the Renaissance promoters all right ladies
[02:25.440 --> 02:29.240]  and gentlemen there is so much coming up today that it makes my head spin we
[02:29.240 --> 02:36.880]  have Ted Nugent coming on the broadcast we have Roger Stone set to be in studio
[02:36.880 --> 02:44.040]  we have a bunch of other special guests but I was walking out of a business this
[02:44.040 --> 02:50.920]  morning buying another toothbrush as I lost my mother one somehow and I travel
[02:50.920 --> 02:55.800]  toothbrush and there just about up and 45 minutes ago was Tucker Carlson who I
[02:55.800 --> 03:02.040]  had dinner with on Sunday evening and some of the daily caller folks and a
[03:02.040 --> 03:06.120]  whole bunch of other press people and he goes oh I'm glad you're coming and I
[03:06.120 --> 03:10.440]  said coming to what he was Nigel Farage and I said who's the benefit is he goes
[03:10.440 --> 03:16.520]  it's mine but no one's you know I said well it's gonna be on Fox Fox at half a
[03:16.520 --> 03:20.880]  brain they'd have you Nigel Farage on you know for a long talk and he goes no
[03:20.880 --> 03:25.280]  no he goes no one's covering it really I said really well I just sent like three
[03:25.280 --> 03:29.760]  reporters or four reporters over there and so we're gonna get the Farage
[03:29.760 --> 03:35.480]  speech that I guess starts about now and then that talk and hopefully an
[03:35.480 --> 03:39.840]  interview and we should have that maybe about a fourth hour today because this
[03:39.840 --> 03:44.640]  I mean we just well the one problem we've got is we need more crew members we
[03:44.640 --> 03:47.120]  don't have enough people to upload all the videos we've got we've got so many
[03:47.120 --> 03:50.720]  big interviews a lot of them are time sensitive but some of them are that are
[03:50.720 --> 03:54.400]  gonna be going out today we're gonna push these all out today so I literally
[03:54.400 --> 04:00.400]  ran in here two minutes before they randomly search every eighth vehicle
[04:00.400 --> 04:05.200]  that comes into the containment zone and the Secret Service searched our vehicle
[04:05.200 --> 04:11.600]  I mean they search them all for bombs with the bomb dog and the and the mirror
[04:11.600 --> 04:14.880]  underneath the car but they searched inside the car and I don't want to give
[04:14.880 --> 04:19.680]  them any trouble but let's just say that well I'll just add another checkpoint
[04:19.680 --> 04:24.120]  yesterday Rob do come tell folks what happened we literally Rob's running the
[04:24.120 --> 04:26.920]  switcher right now news director but he's also gonna come tell you I mean we're
[04:26.920 --> 04:31.960]  talking Secret Service going this happened this morning actually coming in
[04:31.960 --> 04:36.200]  oh yeah they're definitely fans and I've been talking with them in fact the
[04:36.200 --> 04:41.240]  security guard who lets us in at night she her name and her brother's a big fan
[04:41.240 --> 04:45.600]  and he and she goes oh he was so excited to hear that we've met you guys and I
[04:45.600 --> 04:48.760]  took a selfie and sent it to her and again this isn't us bragging hey we're
[04:48.760 --> 04:53.320]  famous it's saying the info yeah and then this morning the Secret Service when
[04:53.320 --> 04:56.440]  we pulled up they do they recognize they're like info wars good job
[04:56.440 --> 04:58.920]  yesterday good job yeah it's crazy let's not get them in too much trouble
[04:58.920 --> 05:03.680]  we'll be back let's face it most of us are totally addicted to our cell phones
[05:03.680 --> 05:07.880]  but recent studies link cell phone use to major health issues including brain
[05:07.880 --> 05:12.120]  cancer experts say parents and expecting mothers need to be extra careful
[05:12.120 --> 05:16.800]  doctors say the infant brain even while in the womb is especially vulnerable so
[05:16.800 --> 05:20.760]  keep the phone away from your abdomen especially toward the end of pregnancy
[05:20.760 --> 05:24.960]  and for men using a cell phone for as little as an hour a day is literally
[05:24.960 --> 05:29.520]  cooking your sperm lowering sperm count levels so much that conceiving a child
[05:29.520 --> 05:33.080]  could be difficult this is one of those times you want to keep it out of your
[05:33.080 --> 05:36.560]  pants and for those of us who use our cell phones before bed know that the
[05:36.560 --> 05:40.640]  screen light is actually disrupting your sleep rhythms this causes insomnia and
[05:40.640 --> 05:44.920]  slow some metabolism hello weight gain generally speaking when cell phones are
[05:44.920 --> 05:48.960]  on they're constantly emitting radio frequency radiation so keep your phone
[05:48.960 --> 05:52.600]  in airplane mode when you can keep the phone at least two feet away from your
[05:52.600 --> 05:56.360]  body use headphones and when you're not on your phone keep it as far away from
[05:56.360 --> 06:00.320]  you as possible Leanne McAdoo with your info wars tip of the week over the

[08:41.720 --> 08:46.800]  this this is what Americans have allowed with the jihadis in this country and the
[08:46.800 --> 08:51.080]  borders wide open and with all the different leftist groups and the
[08:51.080 --> 08:57.320]  Soros fact organizations running around stoking violence this is what you end up

[09:22.160 --> 09:28.080]  30 Eastern be diamond and silk in studio and then the top of the hour at 12 o'clock

[09:32.840 --> 09:37.880]  the bottom of the hour 12 30 1 30 Eastern Ted Nugent on the phone and that should
[09:37.880 --> 09:42.000]  be pretty interesting because of what's going on here at the convention and then
[09:42.000 --> 09:46.160]  after that a one-hour interview with Dinesh to Suza talking about his film
[09:46.160 --> 09:49.160]  which from I haven't seen it but from what I hear from the other crew they
[09:49.160 --> 09:52.680]  said it's one of the best films I've seen in a long time as a documentary I
[09:52.680 --> 09:58.480]  mean America 2015 or 2016 was kind of milk toast and kind of oh he's
[09:58.480 --> 10:03.200]  anti-colonialist well really globalism is corporate colonialism to take us over
[10:03.200 --> 10:08.000]  but it does hint that he hates America no this new film is Hillary is a crime
[10:08.000 --> 10:11.960]  boss a horrible witch the Democrats are an organized crime syndicate hell bent
[10:11.960 --> 10:15.360]  on destroying the country collapsing it consolidating control and putting us in
[10:15.360 --> 10:18.720]  pre-education camps and they're talking to here but that's really what they're
[10:18.720 --> 10:21.800]  doing and boy that happens in most other countries look for crap going on in
[10:21.800 --> 10:25.320]  Turkey right now well and they're using the social media apparatus as the
[10:25.320 --> 10:28.560]  concentration camp now that's like the virtual concentration camp now where
[10:28.560 --> 10:32.400]  they they cut people off Twitter they censor stories that look at my well
[10:32.400 --> 10:37.080]  permanently banned with tens of millions of people on Twitter ridiculous I mean
[10:37.080 --> 10:43.600]  because there's a flamboyant gay guy that says he's sick of of of social
[10:43.600 --> 10:48.360]  justice warriors and their attack on free speech I mean they're a plague they
[10:48.360 --> 10:54.760]  are a literal plague and it is so frustrating just to see this getting
[10:54.760 --> 11:00.760]  worse and worse and worse now really exciting news on my way over here today
[11:00.760 --> 11:05.360]  walking out of a store there was Tucker Carlson with a bunch of people getting
[11:05.360 --> 11:12.720]  out of a sitting in and he said hey Alex great I'm glad you're here and I
[11:12.720 --> 11:16.320]  said what because I had dinner with him and a bunch of media Sunday night when
[11:16.320 --> 11:23.120]  we got in you were there and I go here for what he goes for Raj and I went who
[11:23.120 --> 11:28.320]  he goes Nigel Farage oh Nigel Farage I go what he's you know and I said well
[11:28.320 --> 11:31.160]  where's the media for this he was well I'm just doing a little you know thing
[11:31.160 --> 11:35.200]  with the press a breakfast and I guess it's like a 11th year something that
[11:35.200 --> 11:40.200]  hobbits have because it's almost noon here when that happened and so we just
[11:40.200 --> 11:43.800]  had a bunch of reporters over there very excited about that I I think Nigel
[11:43.800 --> 11:48.720]  Farage like a rock star see I don't get who about rock stars I don't go about
[11:48.720 --> 11:52.680]  movie stars he's retiring in his prime to me and I think we hopefully we can
[11:52.680 --> 11:55.480]  talk him out of that well that's why we said reporters over there at all just
[11:55.480 --> 12:00.360]  basically to talk to him and say how could you be retiring in your prime the
[12:00.360 --> 12:04.440]  thing is he doesn't you know play hard to get or whatever like some politicians
[12:04.440 --> 12:07.840]  doing they say I'm not gonna run for office to make everybody beg for him the
[12:07.840 --> 12:10.680]  times I've talked to him off air he's like oh man I just want to beat this and
[12:10.680 --> 12:14.040]  get back to business in my life and you know back to you know drinking beer at
[12:14.040 --> 12:17.920]  the pub after work I mean he just does not like it but that's why he's so
[12:17.920 --> 12:21.560]  effective yeah he's just straight talks he's scumbags these arrogant people
[12:21.560 --> 12:24.080]  never had a job but you know in their life and of course they tried to kill him
[12:24.080 --> 12:28.880]  and he's had the wheels come off his car and the police set up a sabotage in
[12:28.880 --> 12:34.040]  in in the EU they said no you were sabotaged and then the plane crashed
[12:34.040 --> 12:39.560]  and I mean the the pilots vegetable if Ross climbs out of his whole face smash
[12:39.560 --> 12:44.600]  blood pouring out of his head and we had like many bones broken I mean it was
[12:44.600 --> 12:47.600]  incredible and I was still has the courage to speak out he didn't have that
[12:47.600 --> 12:51.960]  well the thing is the truth is and I don't blame him you know that's kind of
[12:51.960 --> 12:56.320]  something that one guest hinted at you know I'm sure the threats are getting
[12:56.320 --> 12:59.600]  to him at a certain point he's been leading that party since it started 22
[12:59.600 --> 13:03.560]  years ago he's sick of it and I kind of get wanting to not do it anymore because
[13:03.560 --> 13:08.520]  you're either like totally and completely 100% committed you're either
[13:08.520 --> 13:14.480]  totally committed to something or you're you're disengaged that's how I am I
[13:14.480 --> 13:17.240]  can't quit thinking about fighting the globalist I dream about it I live it
[13:17.240 --> 13:20.320]  constantly I'm hyperventilating on air thinking about it yesterday here's
[13:20.320 --> 13:24.240]  hyperventilating off the air I've been letting off the air yesterday I knew
[13:24.240 --> 13:30.000]  they were having this Communist Party that's what officially was event and I
[13:30.000 --> 13:32.520]  knew that they were gonna have a flag burning and I knew they were having
[13:32.520 --> 13:37.960]  Black Lives Matter out there and I knew they had this dicks guy who is like
[13:37.960 --> 13:41.720]  always there a few days before horrible stuff happens stoking the flames and so
[13:41.720 --> 13:44.680]  when I got there and they were screaming at us and surrounding us and trying to
[13:44.680 --> 13:48.040]  bully us even though about a third or more of the folks were info warriors they
[13:48.040 --> 13:51.560]  were all just nicely standing there all the socials were bullying and clawing and
[13:51.560 --> 13:54.960]  you know bumping into me underneath you know the cameras I said I got to get up
[13:54.960 --> 13:58.360]  there on that high spot and get away from these people so I start trying to go
[13:58.360 --> 14:01.160]  up and they're pushing us and they're hitting us and they're pushing our crew
[14:01.160 --> 14:05.900]  and they're pushing on my bodyguards who were there to watch my back and
[14:05.900 --> 14:08.720]  document things yeah and they were having a great and you can now we're
[14:08.720 --> 14:11.920]  kind of go through the videos as we have just so many where they were already
[14:11.920 --> 14:14.880]  having to grab people who were trying to hit me of course these are vegan I'm not
[14:14.880 --> 14:18.120]  bashing vegans but you know vegan leftists are not usually pretty tough
[14:18.120 --> 14:21.920]  it was mainly white kids and white college folks attacking me and so that was
[14:21.920 --> 14:24.800]  already going on I was already putting up with getting shoved and stuff and then
[14:24.800 --> 14:28.440]  suddenly there's red flags around me race does not see right I like
[14:28.440 --> 14:32.040]  scrabbling and I'm being you can see on the video before I started to go ahead
[14:32.040 --> 14:36.520]  and push over them I'm being pushed and poked from both sides but I mean pretty
[14:36.520 --> 14:41.040]  fine I'm moving back and forth and I say that's it I'm going the top steps so I
[14:41.040 --> 14:44.640]  start pushing through them they get pushed out of the way but I keep pushing
[14:44.640 --> 14:48.480]  and then there's a police chief who I obviously you see I wasn't looking my
[14:48.480 --> 14:52.120]  running to him right he grabs my line until oh actually someone with forces
[14:52.120 --> 14:56.080]  actually grabbed me I like oh who's that oh it's the police chief that's a very
[14:56.080 --> 15:01.120]  iconic moment you're like oh the crowd is a police chief which I guess everybody
[15:01.120 --> 15:06.160]  thought was hilarious special police and then the bike cops move in and start
[15:06.160 --> 15:10.880]  separating the people and I got starts at guys me Josh and Zimmerman that's how
[15:10.880 --> 15:13.480]  we got separated from y'all we were getting pushed back by the guys on the
[15:13.480 --> 15:18.400]  bikes I said hey relax relax work we're good that is kind of a commie hat though
[15:18.400 --> 15:22.600]  yeah I don't probably look like but it helps you when they're on yeah and I
[15:22.600 --> 15:25.720]  actually got an interview with the communists later that afternoon and I
[15:25.720 --> 15:28.320]  went up and I go hey aren't you the guys that attacked Alex Jones I think I
[15:28.320 --> 15:30.880]  called him commies aren't you the commies that attacked Alex Jones look we
[15:30.880 --> 15:34.800]  didn't attack him and then we in the video we cut to him pushing you and
[15:34.800 --> 15:38.000]  pushing you and then you push back you know because you can only take so much
[15:38.000 --> 15:41.680]  and you're I mean that's the type it's not even this this the stuff that's
[15:41.680 --> 15:44.800]  going on in this convention is sort of a backdrop for what's really going on in
[15:44.800 --> 15:47.280]  America exactly I mean I was I'm sitting there in the heat
[15:47.280 --> 15:53.040]  surrounding people hissing at me and I look at red flags up above me on the
[15:53.040 --> 15:56.720]  steps like they've taken the country they're waving and I I quite frankly I
[15:56.720 --> 15:59.720]  did want to go march up and see what happened because I just had to take the
[15:59.720 --> 16:04.920]  high ground I just it literally scared me for my children these are evil scum
[16:04.920 --> 16:08.360]  man I mean communists have killed 200 million people folks they don't play
[16:08.360 --> 16:11.560]  games they're running the same destabilization program here you say
[16:11.560 --> 16:15.200]  it'll never happen bull this country has been rotted from within by a bunch of
[16:15.200 --> 16:18.440]  traders have snuck in and infiltrated us and I'm done with them and I'm gonna
[16:18.440 --> 16:21.960]  identify him and I'm coming after them people say oh you could have got hurt you
[16:21.960 --> 16:25.160]  could have got whatever the point is I'm not playing around anymore it's not as
[16:25.160 --> 16:28.960]  I'm tough or I'm a hero I'm not laying down to these people and they really
[16:28.960 --> 16:32.640]  pissed me off and I'm sick of their crap a bunch of mass murdering supporters man
[16:32.640 --> 16:36.160]  and you and you see what they're doing they mean business and you see the
[16:36.160 --> 16:40.440]  president up there every time innocent police get killed saying we need to
[16:40.440 --> 16:44.120]  reform the police basically saying that's why they got killed because they're
[16:44.120 --> 16:48.080]  bad they deserve to be shot in the back because somebody else somewhere did
[16:48.080 --> 16:51.520]  something wrong when you look at statistics our police department this
[16:51.520 --> 16:55.840]  country is this is one of the most violent nations on earth it always has
[16:55.840 --> 16:59.800]  been and per capita of the amount of violence we have we have a very restrained
[16:59.800 --> 17:02.800]  police force in this country instead what's happened is they've all gone into
[17:02.800 --> 17:06.960]  a militarized fortress mode and that's only gonna get worse when cops are getting
[17:06.960 --> 17:10.440]  shot in the back it's a formula to bring the country down they're building the
[17:10.440 --> 17:15.120]  police state by creating the climate that produces wine so when they take total
[17:15.120 --> 17:19.120]  power they have a police state place so I'm not against the police I'm against
[17:19.120 --> 17:23.040]  the globalist program the architecture I see them building I've seen them do it
[17:23.040 --> 17:26.640]  in other countries the globalist brag they think we're dumb they admit their
[17:26.640 --> 17:29.960]  battle plan and folks we got to save this country because we're not just
[17:29.960 --> 17:33.760]  getting taken over as I've said a thousand times by boss hog we just want to
[17:33.760 --> 17:36.920]  you know basically skim money or something and I'd be bad enough I'd be
[17:36.920 --> 17:39.840]  against it because it always leads you to something worse we're at the point of
[17:39.840 --> 17:43.680]  it leading to the worst thing you can have so the games are over ladies and
[17:43.680 --> 17:47.080]  gentlemen the gloves are off the globalists are attacking and everybody I
[17:47.080 --> 17:50.520]  don't care whether you're in a uniform or whether your school teacher or whether
[17:50.520 --> 17:54.360]  you're a garbage truck driver you are a human who deserves freedom and you're
[17:54.360 --> 17:58.600]  good people and I don't care if you're in the military or your social worker or
[17:58.600 --> 18:02.320]  you're a liberal your conservative who you are through the left you can have
[18:02.320 --> 18:05.480]  tyranny through the right you can have tyranny okay and the globalist direct
[18:05.480 --> 18:08.320]  both of those throughout history they write books admitting it like tragedy
[18:08.320 --> 18:11.640]  and hope written for the State Department the CIA so they could understand
[18:11.640 --> 18:15.600]  why do we fund fascist and communists why don't because they want centralized
[18:15.600 --> 18:18.720]  control they want to give you fake choices but then you're always just
[18:18.720 --> 18:23.360]  choosing another flavor of tyranny there's no doubt tyrannies here there's no
[18:23.360 --> 18:26.400]  doubt they're coming after free speech and they're manifesting through the
[18:26.400 --> 18:30.120]  left right now they're manifesting through the left the globalists will try
[18:30.120 --> 18:33.760]  to manifest tyranny to the right as well but we should try to reach out to
[18:33.760 --> 18:37.400]  people on the left and the right who who who are confused and don't know what's
[18:37.400 --> 18:41.960]  going on and explain all this and then transcend it and then deal with it but
[18:41.960 --> 18:45.640]  it's time that these communists who try to intimidate people and socialists and
[18:45.640 --> 18:49.520]  BLM and all the Soros affiliated groups and the Ford Foundation groups no we're
[18:49.520 --> 18:53.720]  not stopping we're not backing down we're getting stronger if we don't
[18:53.720 --> 18:57.720]  identify these people and lay down to them they win if we start resisting them
[18:57.720 --> 19:02.280]  in the information war and by physically being there and saying we're taking the
[19:02.280 --> 19:07.560]  hill you want to fight here we are you started first see what happens we win we
[19:07.560 --> 19:10.800]  get stronger they get weaker we're getting stronger they're getting weaker
[19:10.800 --> 19:14.380]  you're seeing death rows right now they've been spending decades rotting out
[19:14.380 --> 19:17.800]  you're up and rotting out the United States for their takeover and now we've
[19:17.800 --> 19:21.320]  identified it the people know what's going on we're moving against it we're
[19:21.320 --> 19:25.000]  getting stronger they're getting weaker we're getting stronger they're getting
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.080]  weaker we're getting stronger they're getting weaker day by day and they're
[19:29.080 --> 19:32.520]  panicking and they're throwing everything they've got at us in desperation they
[19:32.520 --> 19:36.560]  admit they're desperate and I'm never stopping I'm never backing down I'm
[19:36.560 --> 19:42.160]  never giving in I've never given up ever ever ever ever ever ever ever in the

[24:49.540 --> 24:54.820]  because I've been neglecting to do this this is a massive expenditure obviously
[24:54.820 --> 24:57.940]  of money for any media organization aware mom and pop independent
[24:57.940 --> 25:03.740]  organization that's got about 55 people in it and then of course auxiliary
[25:03.740 --> 25:09.060]  reporters and contractors and folks less than a hundred people total having the
[25:09.060 --> 25:14.020]  effect of media wise punching through the Berlin Wall of controlled disinformation
[25:14.020 --> 25:18.540]  that is mainstream media punching through with a searing flame-throwing white
[25:18.540 --> 25:22.460]  hot spotlight of truth just crashing the lives of this information
[25:22.460 --> 25:27.480]  unapologetically taking the enemy on a head-on like a like a rampaging 18
[25:27.480 --> 25:31.380]  wheeler you know running over the jihadis instead of the jihadis running
[25:31.380 --> 25:35.820]  over us but in the information war and the globalist or ally with every radical
[25:35.820 --> 25:42.260]  hateful out-of-control group that you can imagine and they're creating total
[25:42.260 --> 25:48.660]  distractions total diversions with things like you know did Melania Trump
[25:48.660 --> 25:52.580]  lift some lines about heritage and her family I mean everybody says that the
[25:52.580 --> 25:56.860]  speech I've talked to Roger Stone and I've also talked to some of our other
[25:56.860 --> 26:06.860]  sources that obviously go unnamed but the bottom line is is that Lewandowski
[26:06.860 --> 26:11.220]  who has been a troublemaker all along inside the campaign I've never talked
[26:11.220 --> 26:15.460]  about that in a year and a half that I've had some knowledge of the campaign
[26:15.460 --> 26:19.300]  not just from stone but from others everything stone ever told me then came
[26:19.300 --> 26:23.900]  true or was already had happened and was proven later basically everything I
[26:23.900 --> 26:30.340]  don't think I've ever seen stone be wrong quite frankly I talked to him every
[26:30.340 --> 26:33.380]  day so that was multiple times a day because he's just really interesting guy
[26:33.380 --> 26:36.060]  if I get after this campaign is over I tend to keep talking to stone he I mean
[26:36.060 --> 26:39.500]  he I mean he's a fun guy he's type of guy you you know take on vacation with
[26:39.500 --> 26:42.780]  you I mean he's just really funny really smart a real guy but anyways enough
[26:42.780 --> 26:49.940]  bromance there he's gonna tell you the inside scoop on Fox and he told me the
[26:49.940 --> 26:55.580]  inside scoop on Fox six months ago he told me the inside scoop a month ago he
[26:55.580 --> 26:58.700]  told me the inside scoop I'm gonna go ahead and just let you know a week ago
[26:58.700 --> 27:01.940]  that's why you heard me go ahead and he said yeah it's starting to come out you
[27:01.940 --> 27:05.180]  can talk about it but then I talked to other people at Fox obviously I don't
[27:05.180 --> 27:10.060]  get them in trouble Tiger Carlson is not one of my sources I don't ever bring up
[27:10.060 --> 27:16.700]  Fox news stuff with them but I do talk to him sometimes off air and it's amazing
[27:16.700 --> 27:21.620]  absolutely amazing what's going on at Fox news in fact I wish I would have made a
[27:21.620 --> 27:24.860]  bigger deal about this a few weeks ago when I was authorized to start talking
[27:24.860 --> 27:29.860]  about it but quite frankly it's so off my radar Fox news itself and how arrogant
[27:29.860 --> 27:33.500]  Fox news is and how Fox News thinks it's God and so many of its personalities
[27:33.500 --> 27:40.780]  are just unbelievably narcissistic I guess would be the word that I just it's
[27:40.780 --> 27:45.540]  really not on my radar screen I mean I here's the thing I know what Fox news is
[27:45.540 --> 27:52.180]  I know what it's designed to do but what they're now doing to it is big news what
[27:52.180 --> 27:56.100]  is now happening at Fox news is gonna happen everybody else and so many
[27:56.100 --> 28:01.260]  people I see on info wars and prison planet are saying oh great I hope Fox
[28:01.260 --> 28:04.980]  news falls apart oh I'm glad that the Murdochs are about to take it left screw
[28:04.980 --> 28:08.700]  it it'll just collapse the fact that they're getting ready to bring down
[28:08.700 --> 28:12.340]  Fox news everyone shows you they understand that they have to completely
[28:12.340 --> 28:16.260]  shut down the Liberty Movement and even the the the artificial one that was
[28:16.260 --> 28:20.140]  there to control things now that it's failed and has been radicalized it's
[28:20.140 --> 28:25.060]  got to be controlled demoed and when I say this folks you understand what you're
[28:25.060 --> 28:29.620]  hearing is the facts okay now I could see this from afar knowing the different
[28:29.620 --> 28:34.700]  players years ago and I knew they were using the whole hacking scandal to
[28:34.700 --> 28:38.340]  threaten the Murdoch empire to make him come closer to Hillary we knew this four
[28:38.340 --> 28:41.660]  years ago and we told you this was happening and he you know give more
[28:41.660 --> 28:45.660]  money to Hillary than he does Republicans and you've seen some folks
[28:45.660 --> 28:49.220]  trying to follow orders like Bill O'Reilly and start you know being nice to
[28:49.220 --> 28:52.940]  Hillary saying nice things about Hillary there's a lot that goes into this so
[28:52.940 --> 28:56.340]  when we come back I'm gonna try to just give you what's happening without going
[28:56.340 --> 29:00.540]  down rabbit trails to back it up but just understand they're taking Fox news
[29:00.540 --> 29:03.220]  down right now and they're gonna take Rush Limbaugh down they're gonna take
[29:03.220 --> 29:08.380]  Matt drudge down you're like oh well you know drudge you know he's a great guy
[29:08.380 --> 29:12.300]  but so what or or oh Limbaugh you know that guys but you know they kind of a
[29:12.300 --> 29:15.980]  warmonger the point is the globalist aren't gonna leave him around okay
[29:15.980 --> 29:20.180]  because they know he's pro-guine and it doesn't hate America okay that no one is
[29:20.180 --> 29:24.980]  gonna be left on air unless you want to bring the country down okay they got

[33:58.460 --> 34:01.140]  one of those I could go meet him in person I've never done that but I just
[34:01.140 --> 34:07.700]  came to the show so yes I'm like a fan fanboy you know I want to I want to go
[34:07.700 --> 34:12.460]  meet the Rockstar well he's a patriot man he just got the beginning of the UK
[34:12.460 --> 34:16.460]  out of the EU and a serious blow to the globalist and I know they'll reconfigure
[34:16.460 --> 34:19.540]  and come back again that's the animating contest of Liberty point is we are
[34:19.540 --> 34:22.580]  kicking their butt but guys want to meet some quarterback that's one of the
[34:22.580 --> 34:27.180]  Super Bowl four times I could care less quite frankly I mean I just care less I
[34:27.180 --> 34:32.500]  want to meet people that are defending my family and who've been you know who
[34:32.500 --> 34:36.500]  they've tried to murder repeatedly and they just keep fighting back but that's
[34:36.500 --> 34:40.060]  good because I'm an extremist ladies and gentlemen that's that's the kind of
[34:40.060 --> 34:43.380]  stuff I'm into and again folks I like football as much as the next person the
[34:43.380 --> 34:46.860]  point is this country isn't such dire straits that I don't care about football
[34:46.860 --> 34:51.660]  anymore just 15 years ago I still watch football I even watched the Red Sox
[34:51.660 --> 34:56.220]  last time we went to the World Series again I mean I get it I'm not judging you
[34:56.220 --> 35:01.540]  the point is we're being taken over ladies and gentlemen and so yeah I went
[35:01.540 --> 35:04.780]  to Dallas Cowboy games when I was a kid okay great you know my grandfather was
[35:04.780 --> 35:08.620]  like super good buddies best buddies in college and then when they went to World
[35:08.620 --> 35:13.940]  War two both the Army Air Corps with you know the Tom Landry the point is is
[35:13.940 --> 35:21.860]  that that's not that exciting to me okay what's exciting to me is we are on the
[35:21.860 --> 35:27.220]  verge of crushing the globalist Liberty is rising and no amount of
[35:27.220 --> 35:30.260]  manipulation no amount of betrayal even of Trump's an operative which I don't
[35:30.260 --> 35:34.220]  think he has no amount of that can put it back together again if we just stand
[35:34.220 --> 35:39.940]  up that's where I'm going now on the Fox News situation
[35:41.980 --> 35:55.660]  Roger Ailes worked with Patriots at the FCC in the mid 1980s with the head
[35:55.660 --> 36:02.340]  lawyer head counsel Mr. Fine look in comes on the show and nobody even cares
[36:02.340 --> 36:06.140]  this is the guy that fought and battled to have free speech again on talk radio
[36:06.140 --> 36:11.100]  you couldn't go on the radio and criticize the left they would let leftist
[36:11.100 --> 36:15.260]  have talk shows but then nobody listened but but you couldn't supposedly be
[36:15.260 --> 36:20.020]  political that's what they want to bring backs folks and Roger Ailes say what
[36:20.020 --> 36:26.700]  you want about him he now they're trying to oust him for for hugging Megan Kelly
[36:26.700 --> 36:32.700]  six years ago and I know people that know Roger Ailes they say the guy is
[36:32.700 --> 36:39.900]  super nice super funny super weird quirky he's super old and sick now and
[36:39.900 --> 36:44.740]  they're just trying to kick him out because he had the formula of women in
[36:44.740 --> 36:49.380]  news he's the guy that brought women in to dominate news say what you want about
[36:49.380 --> 36:54.260]  it I mean he wrote the book on at all he created Fox News that was a counter to
[36:54.260 --> 36:59.340]  CNN and and even though it was synthetic and even though Rupert Murdoch was in
[36:59.340 --> 37:05.420]  there trying to make it go more left Ailes was able to basically block that
[37:05.420 --> 37:12.260]  for a long time now you notice Fox News has been totally anti-Trump done every
[37:12.260 --> 37:17.180]  dirty trick you can imagine and this is part of a dirty trick to bring down
[37:17.180 --> 37:23.100]  Roger Ailes and and everyone that supports him and I think it's genius and
[37:23.100 --> 37:27.340]  you go to drudgereport.com and sell the coverage of this and force has some
[37:27.340 --> 37:30.900]  coverage but drudge has it all I'm gonna cover more later in the broadcast that
[37:30.900 --> 37:34.820]  dozens of their top people including Hannity and others are saying we're
[37:34.820 --> 37:41.220]  going to leave if you get rid of Ailes because if they all leave they can go
[37:41.220 --> 37:45.100]  create another competing network as a group of personalities with Ailes and
[37:45.100 --> 37:50.860]  that will defeat Fox see they don't want that though the globalists want everybody
[37:50.860 --> 37:56.180]  to kind of stay there and then slowly fire people and slowly intimidate
[37:56.180 --> 37:59.140]  people a lot of folks have said hey why have you been nicer to Sean Hannity
[37:59.140 --> 38:04.620]  lately well he's got more hardcore and I knew not from not from Roger Stone who
[38:04.620 --> 38:09.700]  is a consultant and works for Fox I mean he wears that you know hat and I'm not
[38:09.700 --> 38:13.940]  gonna get into you know inside baseball on that I've learned a lot more from
[38:13.940 --> 38:16.700]  other people higher up at Fox I'm gonna stop right there but everything
[38:16.700 --> 38:20.540]  Stones told me meshes with that you notice Stone hadn't been on Fox in six
[38:20.540 --> 38:27.420]  months that is Hillary Clinton through Rupert Murdoch okay and that is the
[38:27.420 --> 38:31.300]  direct orders to Roger Ailes and it's not just him it's dozens and dozens and
[38:31.300 --> 38:36.300]  dozens and dozens of people MSNBC and CNN you notice banned him at the same time
[38:36.300 --> 38:41.060]  and suddenly he wasn't on Fox either that's because they didn't want to
[38:41.060 --> 38:48.740]  announce the ban okay this is a Hillary White House order and they keep
[38:48.740 --> 38:54.260]  warning Ailes you let Trump go on there you let Hannity talk about rape we're
[38:54.260 --> 39:01.980]  coming after you and and so this is an internal war at news core at Fox a lot
[39:01.980 --> 39:04.700]  of folks that they're go good let them fall you're gonna get bigger a lot of
[39:04.700 --> 39:07.820]  people at Fox have told me that I don't I don't understand it's part of a
[39:07.820 --> 39:12.500]  globalist program sure it's it's fake conservative a lot of it but still the
[39:12.500 --> 39:16.780]  good stuff that gets out the globalist hate and they want to strangle it they
[39:16.780 --> 39:20.180]  want to make it super conservative light but a bunch of leftist garbage in
[39:20.180 --> 39:23.940]  there Megan Kelly's been brought in on all this she's on evil witch-like
[39:23.940 --> 39:28.940]  power trip with Rupert Murdoch and his sons and these are horrible horrible
[39:28.940 --> 39:33.980]  people okay I mean when you see Megan Kelly folks she is evil anti-American
[39:33.980 --> 39:41.060]  dangerous and a damn liar on top of it okay and oh my gosh he told women they
[39:41.060 --> 39:48.580]  were pretty oh my gosh he he hugged her and and squeezed her oh my this is so
[39:48.580 --> 39:51.820]  horrible this is the most evil thing I've ever heard of in my life
[39:51.820 --> 39:55.620]  meanwhile the Clintons are running around murdering people launching wars
[39:55.620 --> 39:58.380]  having hundreds of thousands of Christians killed all over the Middle
[39:58.380 --> 40:02.980]  East overthrowing our allies do the most horrible stuff you can imagine
[40:02.980 --> 40:08.820]  covering up all these rapes settling rape cases make no mistake folks they're
[40:08.820 --> 40:11.820]  going to go after Fox they're going to go after Drudge they're going to go after
[40:11.820 --> 40:14.940]  they've already basically come in with Goldman Sachs money and taken over almost
[40:14.940 --> 40:20.060]  all of Claire channel okay so what you want about Claire channel years ago they
[40:20.060 --> 40:23.780]  battled that some of their top executives are actually listeners of mine and
[40:23.780 --> 40:28.740]  put me on Sirius XM that was a big bold move and you know why they did it they
[40:28.740 --> 40:32.500]  did it because they're worried about their kids and they said we hope what you
[40:32.500 --> 40:36.540]  do spreads and other talk show hosts pick it up because it's the truth and you
[40:36.540 --> 40:40.420]  know what it did happen people hadn't people at clear channel purposely
[40:40.420 --> 40:45.460]  infected clear channel with me they even under the radar put me on some other
[40:45.460 --> 40:49.220]  stations okay I don't want to even talk about this but it's time people
[40:49.220 --> 40:53.540]  understand I know what's going on okay there are patriots at Fox News there are
[40:53.540 --> 40:57.780]  patriots inside clear channel one of George Norrie who took that show from
[40:57.780 --> 41:04.100]  all UFOs in Chubacabra's to 80% Sirius news at a serious risk to his job they
[41:04.100 --> 41:08.340]  said okay you go ahead and do this but you know you fail or whatever you notice
[41:08.340 --> 41:13.060]  he made the show even bigger so there are people there are people that have done
[41:13.060 --> 41:16.940]  everything they can within the system to try to save this country and George
[41:16.940 --> 41:22.220]  Norrie Roger Ailes people like that and look Roger Ailes isn't perfect by any
[41:22.220 --> 41:26.700]  stretch imagination I was offered weekend shows with them to start and
[41:26.700 --> 41:31.340]  they'll of course and we'll fly you and I'm like even if you get flying me first
[41:31.340 --> 41:34.980]  class every every week it's not that I'm some big star or something I'm not
[41:34.980 --> 41:39.020]  gonna be cramped on airplane with my back trebles and stuff you know I mean
[41:39.020 --> 41:41.980]  I'm in body slam folks straight into concrete in high school and stuff like
[41:41.980 --> 41:46.460]  that I mean I'm I've got probably brain damage and stuff I just I just have got
[41:46.460 --> 41:49.300]  not a lot of health issues I'm pretty healthy a lot of ways but I've been
[41:49.300 --> 41:52.220]  through a lot I'm not trying to bitch I just don't want to sound like I'm sitting
[41:52.220 --> 41:55.060]  here on any first class that sounds horrible the truth is I need to sit in
[41:55.060 --> 41:58.100]  first class I can't sit in a regular plane seat my shoulders are too wide and
[41:58.100 --> 42:01.540]  I mean of course anybody knows that a small man can hardly sit one the point
[42:01.540 --> 42:06.500]  is I'm digressing and then they're like you don't want to show on Fox and I
[42:06.500 --> 42:09.020]  said nope I don't want to show in Fox and then the offers got bigger and bigger
[42:09.020 --> 42:14.260]  okay so that's why I love later in the New York Daily News they said that I had
[42:14.260 --> 42:17.940]  asked for a show and then I didn't get one and that I was mad that was one of
[42:17.940 --> 42:21.740]  the so-called unnamed Fox executives that wasn't a Fox executive that was a
[42:21.740 --> 42:26.780]  Glenn Beck producer that was still there that's that's the world of these people
[42:26.780 --> 42:29.540]  so oh let me finish the story because it's one of the most important things I
[42:29.540 --> 42:37.580]  ever talked about I'm sorry I digress in the in the spinal issues like two of
[42:37.580 --> 42:45.940]  the in my one of my neck are almost completely fused now anyways you talk
[42:45.940 --> 42:48.900]  about when your head's hurting sorry my next turn that's why I was gonna do that
[42:48.900 --> 42:52.060]  on air and then I'll start telling people why why I do certain ticks and
[42:52.060 --> 42:56.660]  things and I don't know the point is is that this is so epic what's going on
[42:56.660 --> 43:02.340]  right now and and and it makes me completely sick okay because you notice
[43:02.340 --> 43:06.980]  I didn't finish the rest of story did I Glenn Beck it isn't about Glenn Beck
[43:06.980 --> 43:09.900]  sneaking around behind the scenes always trying to sabotage me and not have
[43:09.900 --> 43:13.380]  radio stations carry me and get my sponsors and the rest of it it's that
[43:13.380 --> 43:16.140]  he's a Benedict Arnold who knows they're getting ready to take out conservative
[43:16.140 --> 43:20.420]  libertarian and patriot media so he's going to NBC and trying to get a meet
[43:20.420 --> 43:24.220]  the press job oh yeah and going on there and saying vote for Hillary Clinton I
[43:24.220 --> 43:28.540]  mean the guy is literally Judas Ascariot except he doesn't have the
[43:28.540 --> 43:33.500]  decency to go hang himself the next day I mean he doesn't have the decent because
[43:33.500 --> 43:38.700]  he's he's worse than Judas Judas felt bad about being intimidated into betraying
[43:38.700 --> 43:45.540]  Christ he loves it he absolutely loves it and that's why you see all this Megan
[43:45.540 --> 43:50.580]  Kelly and him and all of them are getting ready for the purge and thank
[43:50.580 --> 43:55.820]  God Sean Hannity who I know risk his job I know he's been threatened and told get
[43:55.820 --> 44:00.120]  ready to lose your job and I know he has pressure through clear channel as well
[44:00.120 --> 44:05.940]  to back off Hillary and you know what he hasn't been doing it and now you've
[44:05.940 --> 44:10.380]  got dozens of them as some are saying 30 are threatening to leave now I mean it
[44:10.380 --> 44:13.660]  was just a few last night if they bring down Roger Ailes so that's good that's
[44:13.660 --> 44:17.380]  American fighting spirit and now maybe those people can understand that I was
[44:17.380 --> 44:21.100]  right all along about the level of tyranny and how dangerous things are and
[44:21.100 --> 44:23.900]  that it doesn't matter down the road if we have a right winger in office that
[44:23.900 --> 44:26.660]  tries stuff like this you've got to stand against it because this country and
[44:26.660 --> 44:30.540]  our children are in deep trouble and this world is in deep trouble this isn't
[44:30.540 --> 44:37.260]  a game people and it comes down to your soul do you want to be with with Glenn
[44:37.260 --> 44:45.540]  Beck and do you want to be with Megan Kelly these these evil narcissistic
[44:45.540 --> 44:51.260]  horribly dark betrayers I mean is that who you want to be with in your life I'm
[44:51.260 --> 44:54.780]  talking the listeners that's what this comes down to I mean thank God that I'm
[44:54.780 --> 44:59.420]  with Mavericks and Patriots like Matt Drudge and Joseph Farrah and other
[44:59.420 --> 45:03.180]  folks like that and people like Tucker Carlson who wasn't that hardcore years
[45:03.180 --> 45:07.060]  ago but as it became safer to fight the new World Order he starts doing it
[45:07.060 --> 45:11.820]  because now he's able to people are showing you their true colors right now
[45:11.820 --> 45:15.780]  ladies and gentlemen that's what happens when stuff starts to get bad okay that's
[45:15.780 --> 45:19.860]  what happens and I cannot express to you enough how much danger this country is
[45:19.860 --> 45:24.500]  in it's teetering on the edge they are inches away from activating jihadi
[45:24.500 --> 45:29.180]  sleeper cells that'll bring in martial law they are the BBC is announcing oh
[45:29.180 --> 45:34.220]  we're gonna we're looking at stop saying the word terrorist all together and
[45:34.220 --> 45:37.820]  people say oh they're floating it yeah no they're gonna do it now they always
[45:37.820 --> 45:41.940]  say should we not say mother and father and then they ban it in government
[45:41.940 --> 45:45.140]  forms then they tell the kids don't use it because like mother and father is bad
[45:45.140 --> 45:50.100]  yes it hurts someone who doesn't have it talk about class warfare dividing
[45:50.100 --> 45:52.660]  people they have a mother or father or don't talk about how you have a mother
[45:52.660 --> 45:57.100]  and father that might hurt someone who doesn't I mean do-do-do-do like don't I
[45:57.100 --> 46:01.340]  mean that's later the test tube babies there's some people from test tubes
[46:01.340 --> 46:08.620]  that's what I told this is coming a decade ago persecution of robots and now
[46:08.620 --> 46:14.060]  it's in all the movies and we need rights for AI see oh yes I mean I can see
[46:14.060 --> 46:17.660]  their whole plan and I understand why other people who didn't read globalist
[46:17.660 --> 46:21.980]  white papers who didn't sit around reading 1,100 page text 1,200 page text
[46:21.980 --> 46:25.740]  and in in World War two you know secret wartime reports that were
[46:25.740 --> 46:30.460]  declassified and psychological warfare manuals of the Soviets and the British I
[46:30.460 --> 46:35.260]  mean I've I've done the research okay and I was younger then I had a photographic
[46:35.260 --> 46:39.660]  memory and I could just read a book in the hours now don't have a photograph
[46:39.660 --> 46:43.460]  memory anymore it's kind of pleasing I'll be honest with people because before
[46:43.460 --> 46:47.100]  everything I'd see information it was just like my head would burn you know
[46:47.100 --> 46:51.340]  my it was just like knowing so much and in seeing what's the patterns and other
[46:51.340 --> 46:56.020]  people don't see it they don't understand and I'm telling you folks I'm
[46:56.020 --> 47:00.020]  nothing special but I'm kind of an idiot so long at larger political systems
[47:00.020 --> 47:04.700]  and what's really behind them and I and it's proven that my view of the world and
[47:04.700 --> 47:08.540]  how it operates is more accurate than the disinformation view the globalist
[47:08.540 --> 47:13.220]  put out on purpose this is not rocket science now again there's a lot of
[47:13.220 --> 47:15.740]  checkpoints it's hard to get people in and out we have to be searched by the
[47:15.740 --> 47:19.100]  Secret Service remember we come into here and we're gonna get stacked up today
[47:19.100 --> 47:23.740]  with guests but the diamonds and some are coming in hey ladies come on in here
[47:23.740 --> 47:28.500]  jump on in beautifulls hey it's a good to have you here we're talking about how

[47:31.260 --> 47:34.020]  does that they take down the lead elephant they're gonna try to take
[47:34.020 --> 47:39.380]  everybody down and the metaphor is intended I'm here sweetheart how are

[47:53.660 --> 47:58.540]  supporting Trump and I would imagine you're more proud now than ever because he
[47:58.540 --> 48:02.220]  wants to keep us safe and secure he wants to bring back jobs where we can
[48:02.220 --> 48:06.060]  thrive and he wants to unite this country bring back spirit so that's why
[48:06.060 --> 48:09.980]  we're we're supporting and we're excited what has it been like ladies for you
[48:09.980 --> 48:14.980]  personally I know you guys are positive about getting Donald Trump who is an
[48:14.980 --> 48:18.260]  America hater you just did not get the country that's that's good enough for me
[48:18.260 --> 48:23.700]  what do you make though of the threats you've gone through and and I know you
[48:23.700 --> 48:26.820]  guys you know warning me able to speak at the rally a while back but we ended
[48:26.820 --> 48:29.620]  up coming anyways because the death threats and things and we should talk
[48:29.620 --> 48:32.500]  about the so-called left these people don't act like any liberals I ever knew
[48:32.500 --> 48:35.740]  before what's happened to these people but we don't know what's happening to
[48:35.740 --> 48:39.600]  the left but these death threats we haven't heard anything about no death
[48:39.600 --> 48:43.380]  threats we've never received death threats so we don't know who made up that
[48:43.380 --> 48:47.940]  malicious lie okay good you know there is no way that we would have missed our man
[48:47.940 --> 48:53.940]  in this event for Donald jay well I guess they were putting that out then so
[48:53.940 --> 48:56.580]  you wouldn't come and others wouldn't come it would scare people away but but
[48:56.580 --> 49:01.060]  then now I learned it wasn't true that's not true and we and we make we made every
[49:01.060 --> 49:05.140]  event even the citizens for Trump right we were able to go out there and speak
[49:05.140 --> 49:09.980]  and we had a phenomenal time other disinformation it is a wall of lies so
[49:09.980 --> 49:12.700]  we don't know what the left star is something to share of something we don't
[49:12.700 --> 49:16.460]  know where it came but getting back to that you guys haven't ever been threatened
[49:16.460 --> 49:21.780]  I mean no no we stand up to people we have to listen Alice we are not afraid of
[49:21.780 --> 49:25.580]  people I will stand I know that it's not like you guys I was certainly you're
[49:25.580 --> 49:27.620]  wearing trumps had a lot of threats there's been a lot of attacks in his
[49:27.620 --> 49:33.340]  rallies listen we don't the more they hate the more we have to educate yes
[49:33.340 --> 49:37.460]  that's what it's about so we don't get into the riffraff of people we don't
[49:37.460 --> 49:42.380]  understand my audience gets gets it they're like I'd say 95% Trump and as the
[49:42.380 --> 49:45.140]  whole elite comes after more of the other 5% that weren't are getting on board
[49:45.140 --> 49:49.460]  but but I mean behind the scenes you guys got a prompt really really good I
[49:49.460 --> 49:55.460]  mean what's it like knowing Trump himself I mean the person that loves
[49:55.460 --> 50:00.060]  America yes Americans yes want to just know that you're making it want to know
[50:00.060 --> 50:03.100]  that you're doing more than making it you're thriving and I just survived him
[50:03.100 --> 50:07.020]  he's present he's sensitive so when he's talking to you you have his
[50:07.020 --> 50:12.940]  undivided attention he's a very humble man he love all Americans he don't care
[50:12.940 --> 50:18.940]  if you're red black white blue he don't care what color you are yeah he don't
[50:18.940 --> 50:22.940]  care well be honest you ladies a little bit sweet on him aren't you
[50:22.940 --> 50:29.780]  listen I always say Donald Trump is my man I love that listen I love a person
[50:29.780 --> 50:33.660]  you know what I like about him we've had the first African-American president
[50:33.660 --> 50:38.180]  not one time have he ever said I'm gonna do something for African-American that's
[50:38.180 --> 50:42.020]  right but Donald Trump is bold enough to say you know what I'm gonna be the
[50:42.020 --> 50:46.740]  greatest president for African-Americans I'm like he he's not embarrassed of us
[50:46.740 --> 50:53.980]  as African-Americans he acknowledges us that's why I'm doing for Donald Trump
[50:53.980 --> 50:58.940]  have done forever they just say he likes real people exactly absolutely the real
[50:58.940 --> 51:03.140]  person that's right he's real but to have the first black president never
[51:03.140 --> 51:06.740]  mentioning nothing about you right but then having Donald Trump I'm gonna be
[51:06.740 --> 51:10.820]  good for you too don't you worry we got you to specifically yeah we're gonna
[51:10.820 --> 51:14.900]  come with actual jobs absolutely yeah and that's what we need let's say we don't
[51:14.900 --> 51:17.900]  want that he was everybody under his control we don't need a old by my phone
[51:17.900 --> 51:21.140]  give people good jobs they can buy their own phone with me we're here in Cleveland
[51:21.140 --> 51:26.100]  where the Obama phone ladies from I tell you she is he is he I've got to know
[51:26.100 --> 51:30.740]  where she's a sweet lady but it's so sad she really just thinks you know that
[51:30.740 --> 51:35.820]  that somehow somebody's got to save her that's being handed the crumbs see they
[51:35.820 --> 51:40.900]  so conditioning used to be handed the crumbs the crumbs of oh give me this
[51:40.900 --> 51:44.500]  little phone yeah how was that gonna help you make it how is that gonna help
[51:44.500 --> 51:47.740]  you thrive that's what I believe him when he said what Obama said he was
[51:47.740 --> 51:50.940]  actually to get that lady a house that he didn't actually follow through to get
[51:50.940 --> 51:55.320]  at least for her it had to be some local Republicans that did it that was so
[51:55.320 --> 51:58.300]  mean let's say we're gonna take care of you living in your car and it doesn't
[51:58.300 --> 52:02.540]  even do it but he don't have a problem with helping illegal immigrants get
[52:02.540 --> 52:08.180]  cars and yeah the whole system is called yeah somebody like Donald Trump
[52:08.180 --> 52:11.580]  coming say you know what this system is flawed this system is gonna work for
[52:11.580 --> 52:16.300]  America's and we're gonna put Americans first what yes we go vote for him yes

[52:28.660 --> 52:32.460]  what I love is I've had some rallies here I mean the rally you were at as
[52:32.460 --> 52:37.300]  well and it was wonderful as I think at least a third of the people at the
[52:37.300 --> 52:41.500]  Trump rally that I was with you the other day were black Americans that is so
[52:41.500 --> 52:45.460]  good oh yeah to challenge the media narrative that if you're in the tea
[52:45.460 --> 52:49.340]  party you're racist that is intended to actually make people believe that so
[52:49.340 --> 52:52.900]  they don't have a chance if they're libertarians or if they're conservatives
[52:52.900 --> 52:56.140]  I mean that's a big insult to just say you're not allowed to even come to this
[52:56.140 --> 52:59.940]  yeah well I'm gonna tell you what the black people white people are coming off
[52:59.940 --> 53:04.540]  of that Democratic plantation baby and they are jumping on the Trump train and
[53:04.540 --> 53:07.740]  they keep wanting to put out this here little stigma oh well he may not have
[53:07.740 --> 53:11.060]  African-Americans he have African-American oh yeah my closet it
[53:11.060 --> 53:14.300]  because they don't want to be ostracized but he have black people that's going to
[53:14.300 --> 53:17.540]  be voting for him because you know what they want to come up they want to drive
[53:17.540 --> 53:21.900]  again someone's to be on when they say he hates gays and then he was one of the
[53:21.900 --> 53:24.820]  biggest advocates for people that people rights 30 years ago before it was cool
[53:24.820 --> 53:29.540]  it's just everything's alive yeah the left-wing media spinning the line they
[53:29.540 --> 53:33.380]  want to keep us segregated they want us to segregate ourselves by race or
[53:33.380 --> 53:38.860]  gender but Donald Trump want us to be united as one as all of these two yes
[53:38.860 --> 53:43.420]  the opposite of what Martin Luther King said 40 years ago and RFK and JFK said
[53:43.420 --> 53:50.420]  it's literally segregations what the left and then what happens is as soon as
[53:50.420 --> 53:55.620]  something happened where you see it looked like a cop has killed a black
[53:55.620 --> 53:59.940]  boy or african-american now they pulling at the heartstrings of african-americans
[53:59.940 --> 54:03.900]  and then african-americans go out in the street pump they fit black life matter
[54:03.900 --> 54:07.820]  movement started a block traffic and the same people that you protest and
[54:07.820 --> 54:11.620]  against it's the same people that's risking their lives to protect you so
[54:11.620 --> 54:15.060]  they don't want to come to the table you know because to come to the table and
[54:15.060 --> 54:18.580]  solve this problem oh that means the money stopped the propaganda so the
[54:18.580 --> 54:21.940]  tables are not out there in the streets they're here if they're inside that's
[54:21.940 --> 54:26.180]  right how do we solve problems and so the marching pop in your face and acting
[54:26.180 --> 54:29.940]  a fool in the street right and the same thing that the industry do all pumping
[54:29.940 --> 54:33.740]  their fists on it's the same system they keep voting for because it was the
[54:33.740 --> 54:45.420]  crimson's that put the crime bill into law that's what you guys the question
[54:45.420 --> 54:48.820]  what do you guys make of the attempts to bring down the conservatives at fox
[54:48.820 --> 54:52.740]  news and roger ailes and this whole thing that's going on where the left is
[54:52.740 --> 54:55.500]  trying and that's from inside it's a fact they're trying to bring down fox news
[54:55.500 --> 54:59.180]  right now well we don't want that to happen I hope everything work out well
[54:59.180 --> 55:02.940]  is that's all I can say I don't know what's going on but we want everything to
[55:02.940 --> 55:06.620]  work out well there's a coup in turkey or counter coup this is a coup at fox
[55:06.620 --> 55:14.860]  news it is so sad it's the silence the truth they bring down fox news they're
[55:14.860 --> 55:22.020]  gonna bring down everybody else in their free speech we better use it everything
[55:22.020 --> 55:25.860]  else is this wing to the left so we pray for them and everything everything to
[55:25.860 --> 55:28.740]  work out what it's all sad that the left is doing everything they can do to try
[55:28.740 --> 55:32.700]  to save crooked hillary yeah I don't want to bring her down no we let no
[55:32.700 --> 55:38.620]  crook off I'm sure you let me get this but you know I just feel the energy no
[55:38.620 --> 55:41.860]  we just we're very passionate no but I mean it's not just your words I could
[55:41.860 --> 55:45.100]  feel the energy oh really yeah you know when you find this country over 19
[55:45.100 --> 55:49.980]  trillion dollars in debt you have people that are unemployed people standing on
[55:49.980 --> 55:54.100]  the corners with a sign holding the sign saying we'll work for what in the
[55:54.100 --> 55:58.460]  heck is the current administration doing to change that and why would the current
[55:58.460 --> 56:01.900]  administration think that we should vote for that same system for another four
[56:01.900 --> 56:05.300]  to eight years when you ain't done and you had eight almost eight years to do
[56:05.300 --> 56:08.740]  something is that you had not anything clowered in heaven they admit they want
[56:08.740 --> 56:11.820]  us poor and now Bilderberg group met this year and admitted they put a press release
[56:11.820 --> 56:15.220]  out we want to make you poor and give you a stipend every month to control you
[56:15.220 --> 56:19.140]  they actually said we want to control you want you poor yeah so they're now it
[56:19.140 --> 56:23.020]  every conspiracy theorist right again yeah exactly that's what they want to do
[56:23.020 --> 56:26.460]  they want to keep you codependent on the government and once they keep you there
[56:26.460 --> 56:30.060]  they can control you they say sugar ain't for free and they not gonna give you
[56:30.060 --> 56:32.780]  the best stuff now when they give you the crumbs it's gonna be the bare minimum
[56:32.780 --> 56:36.420]  bare minimum in fact that's what they said in his big paper they want a bunch
[56:36.420 --> 56:39.580]  of words for this professor he's a statement of what the system is he said
[56:39.580 --> 56:42.980]  it's the Walmart model I'm not taking water this is what they do where they
[56:42.980 --> 56:47.780]  pay you just enough to but then you're still able to get welfare they don't pay
[56:47.780 --> 56:52.580]  above that so that you work eight ten hours a day but then you got to go to
[56:52.580 --> 56:55.780]  the government and get something on top of it just to live that's the big
[56:55.780 --> 56:59.940]  conspiracy and Donald Trump wants to break that absolutely and I believe he is
[56:59.940 --> 57:02.220]  going to break that yeah that's why when you get out you want to make sure you
[57:02.220 --> 57:05.340]  register vote and you want to make sure you vote for Donald Trump because I
[57:05.340 --> 57:09.780]  believe he can come in and clean up all of this inside a lot of people are
[57:09.780 --> 57:12.740]  closeted about Trump and I think that's why he's gonna have a landslide unless
[57:12.740 --> 57:16.020]  there's a lot of fun absolutely absolutely oh yeah it's gonna be amazing
[57:16.020 --> 57:19.460]  this is gonna be up yes so he's gonna be the 45th president of the United States
[57:19.460 --> 57:24.540]  and well you know what no weapon form against him is going to prosper so
[57:24.540 --> 57:27.820]  whatever the leftist trying to do is not gonna prosper yes you ladies are
[57:27.820 --> 57:30.100]  amazing we're gonna go to break with a few more minutes on it you've got a
[57:30.100 --> 57:33.060]  schedule I've got a schedule but it was it was rough to get in here but a lot of
[57:33.060 --> 57:36.420]  security oh a lot of security yeah but you know what we feel safe thank you
[57:36.420 --> 57:40.100]  police officers I love y'all behind them yes oh and they fine too

[57:58.220 --> 58:01.620]  I mean I looked at that speech that's what everybody says about their roots and

[58:55.820 --> 58:59.380]  about religion some friends of mine encouraged me to pick up the Bible and
[58:59.380 --> 59:03.420]  then showed me that a lot of what I was taught was not even in the Bible they
[59:03.420 --> 59:07.980]  showed me a website called the Bible says that.org the Q&A format was simple
[59:07.980 --> 59:12.340]  and it helped me find my own answers this website challenges and dismantles

[01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:39.140]  and we're gonna talk about inside the battle at Fox and these ladies were
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:43.340]  aware of the big mix-up at Fox but they weren't aware of the full import
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:48.460]  because this is a coup we need articles in Info Wars everyone to explain I have
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:51.900]  inside Fox forces other people do I'm gonna ask Stone about this and what my
[01:00:51.900 --> 01:00:58.020]  sources told me back stones here now there is a war to shut down right now
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:03.180]  as we speak Fox News in an election year three months out from the election and
[01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:07.740]  it's Megan Kelly claiming Roger Ailes squeezed her too hard because the ladies
[01:01:07.740 --> 01:01:09.780]  were hugging me during the break and I'm gonna get another one here in a minute
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:13.740]  and imagine that's what they're trying to bring down Fox News with to literally
[01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:17.500]  turn it into CNN during an election this is sabotage this is a coup but of the
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:20.340]  media just like what you saw in Turkey it's very serious what do you ladies
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.340]  make of that well you know I think it's very sad I think that people need to
[01:01:23.340 --> 01:01:26.060]  start getting there getting their facts straight getting everything together
[01:01:26.060 --> 01:01:29.860]  yeah because we don't need to lose when we come on TV we want to see
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:34.180]  conservative television conservative news that's what we lose Fox what else do
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:39.300]  we have on television because everything else tend to lean loud that's right so I
[01:01:39.300 --> 01:01:42.780]  just hope everything work out and it's gonna work out for everyone's everybody
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:45.180]  we're gonna have to go to the underground we're gonna have to do it like
[01:01:45.180 --> 01:01:51.060]  networking absolutely we gotta do we got Alex Jones here to get down to Trump
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:54.180]  into the White House right that's why I put airplanes on the sky with Hillary
[01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:57.020]  for president's why I've got billboards around with info wars you know learn the
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:00.340]  truth yeah we got 94.5 which is a pirate but it doesn't hurt the other
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:03.660]  stations which is broadcasting here in Cleveland you know just during this
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:07.620]  event so the people's media is under attack we turn the heat up we gotta do

[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:04.100]  hey Joe Biggs here with some brand new information about the social justice
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:08.420]  warrior fight for freedom and allowing men to go into women's restrooms target

[01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:19.700]  target apartment store chain is jumped into the transgender bathroom debate
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:23.220]  by declaring that men who claim to be women may use whatever bathroom or
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:27.220]  changing room they choose yeah we're making such progressive waves
[01:05:27.220 --> 01:05:31.140]  inclusivity is a core belief at Target a new company statement reads it's
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:35.020]  something we celebrate we stand for equality and strive to make our guests
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:39.220]  and team members feel accepted respected and welcomed in our stores and

[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:09.020]  conspiracy I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that
[01:07:09.020 --> 01:07:13.840]  iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ and how the government knowingly started
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:17.580]  taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride the bad member of the
[01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:22.100]  halogen family into the water they took the good halogen out and put the deadly
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:26.220]  halogen in and when the Fukushima crisis worsened as it still is worsening

[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:35.220]  2016 even more information has been revealed concerning the connection
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:39.740]  between iodine and the gut which many experts are now saying could be the
[01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:43.940]  biggest revelation ever concerning iodine you can pull these studies up
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:47.620]  for yourself this is the real deal folks and the truth is that iodine is
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:52.380]  essential in my view to any optimum health regimen stock up on survival

[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:23.820]  listening to Alex Jones
[01:08:23.820 --> 01:08:27.500]  thank you for joining us Ted Nugent's coming up about the hour and I was
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:32.260]  talking about the fact that yes we're having some major victories and and
[01:08:32.260 --> 01:08:37.140]  Trump's been nominated we we defeated them trying to steal the election we saw
[01:08:37.140 --> 01:08:45.180]  Hillary openly steal it in a horrible fashion from Bernie Sanders so this
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:48.340]  country's in trouble and so just like they have coups in foreign countries
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:52.380]  there's coup in in major media operations just like Ted Cruz tried to
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:55.220]  take over the fellow Schlafly operationally somebody in his crew did
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:58.940]  this is much bigger there is a coup at Fox I'm not getting this from Stone
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:02.820]  though he confirms some of it for me he of course has a lot of contacts in Fox
[01:09:02.820 --> 01:09:07.340]  and works as a consultant for him for years and so I'm just filling you in on
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:13.100]  the fact that from my sources this is a real coup over Roger Ailes hugging women
[01:09:13.100 --> 01:09:16.940]  when they hug him just like I hugged a diamond silk earlier they were here so
[01:09:16.940 --> 01:09:21.020]  for me this is the biggest issue yes we're having victories yes the mainstream
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:24.940]  media is on its heels at certain levels but if they take down Fox and you're
[01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:27.780]  talking about dozens of people trying to leave Sean Hannity name it that's why
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:30.700]  the defending Hannity lately saying he's got courage because I know from
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:33.900]  sources he's been threatened to be fired his contract not to be renewed in a few
[01:09:33.900 --> 01:09:37.980]  years if he keeps basically letting Trump talk about rape that's the big no
[01:09:37.980 --> 01:09:41.420]  no it's why he's been not on Fox in six months it's even though he works there
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:44.100]  and I don't mean to give inside baseball that's from other people Roger tell me
[01:09:44.100 --> 01:09:47.020]  if I'm wrong this is not from stone I have other contacts and it's not Tucker
[01:09:47.020 --> 01:09:50.500]  Carlson either I have dinner with the other night this is going on this is a
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:53.740]  major coup I knew about it six months ago and now they're implementing it right
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:57.300]  before the election it's a very bold move Roger how big a deal is this look I
[01:09:57.300 --> 01:09:59.940]  think it's used let me be very clear I'm not a
[01:09:59.940 --> 01:10:05.180]  contributory Fox so I have no self-interest in my comments today this is
[01:10:05.180 --> 01:10:12.460]  this is I think the the move of the globalists sons of Rupert Murdoch who
[01:10:12.460 --> 01:10:16.340]  would like Fox to be more like CNN who would like Fox to be more like the Sky
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:20.500]  Channel in the UK that were course from a business point of view would be an
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:25.060]  enormous mistake because the conservatives will merely go elsewhere
[01:10:25.060 --> 01:10:30.100]  they'll go to info wars they'll go elsewhere also I've known Roger Ailes for
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:35.140]  almost 50 years I know him as a as a family man I knew him when he was younger
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:40.780]  these are ridiculous charges and among other things one thing no one has ever
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:45.180]  accused Roger Ailes is of being stupid see idea that he would you know that he
[01:10:45.180 --> 01:10:49.860]  would stick it in the company inkwell as it were is just out of the question
[01:10:49.860 --> 01:10:54.540]  Roger Ailes could have any beautiful women woman he wants he is very
[01:10:54.540 --> 01:11:00.420]  wealthy based on his success of building the monolith that is Fox so knowing
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:06.580]  him as I have I have no doubt whatsoever that these charges are trumped up BS and
[01:11:06.580 --> 01:11:13.580]  if he indeed leaves Fox Fox will not be the richer for it Fox will be will be
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:19.460]  surpassed by a new conservative network look the other thing I could tell you is
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:27.300]  Ailes has one more launch in him he's got one more you know act in him so if
[01:11:27.300 --> 01:11:32.220]  he is discharged I think you'll have the opportunity to build a new cable news
[01:11:32.220 --> 01:11:36.980]  network plus those people are all trained under him for decades you take 30 of
[01:11:36.980 --> 01:11:41.020]  the people from Fox that is Fox well and and the people who know him best like
[01:11:41.020 --> 01:11:46.380]  Sean Hannity like Monica Crowley like like so much like Judge Andrew Napolitano
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:50.940]  these people are my friends they will all tell you this is nonsense this is
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:57.780]  trumped up charges to try to remove a major conservative voice from the media
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:03.060]  so I have ultimate confidence in Roger Ailes and I hope he fights these charges
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:08.220]  because they are ridiculous also why did Gretchen Carlson wait so long to make
[01:12:08.220 --> 01:12:13.300]  these accusations why did she only make them when her career appeared to be in
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:22.420]  jeopardy the other point I would make here is that that Alex is exactly right
[01:12:22.420 --> 01:12:27.500]  this is part and parcel of the effort which is that we see across the board on
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:33.740]  cyberspace on every other medium I myself have been banned at CNN I've been
[01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:40.380]  banned at MSNBC why because I'm politically incorrect I met with a
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:45.300]  somebody from CNN yesterday we had a very pleasant conversation and I said
[01:12:45.300 --> 01:12:49.700]  well why am I I'm really just kind of curious it's bad enough that you ban
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:54.500]  people that was that was a tactic for Adolf Hitler I believe and Stalin but
[01:12:54.500 --> 01:13:01.140]  you let Ted Cruz come on the air in prime time attacked me by name and then
[01:13:01.140 --> 01:13:03.940]  you don't give me a chance to respond they figured you off because you're
[01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:06.900]  effective and you're not following the White House talking points that you don't
[01:13:06.900 --> 01:13:11.020]  talk about rape we're going to talk about how Donald Trump is real nice to
[01:13:11.020 --> 01:13:14.700]  women when he's not married and dates them and treats them real nice so that's
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:20.020]  some sexual abuse but meanwhile they're settling rape cases for Clinton and so
[01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:22.940]  now they're trying to bring down Roger Ailes the same way and a lot of people
[01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:26.060]  are saying oh good that means we'll get more viewers and listeners no that's not
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:29.860]  how it works they're coming after Matt Drudge and Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones
[01:13:29.860 --> 01:13:34.780]  next guaranteed drugs has come here to warn me I've been warned I've been warned
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:37.740]  by other people he's been warned by Supreme Court justice the one that's
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:43.020]  still alive I mean this is a major climate shift folks in politics to total
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:46.700]  totalitarianism so that's why I wanted to upfront center cover this we're going
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:49.700]  to skip this break because the time we have here is so important this country
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:52.740]  isn't an emergency and that's why it's important for viewers and listeners I'm
[01:13:52.740 --> 01:13:56.780]  not gonna even plug right now just go to him for store.com buy the products some
[01:13:56.780 --> 01:14:00.780]  of the big sales are ending today funder operation great products you need we're
[01:14:00.780 --> 01:14:04.620]  self-funded the enemy has trouble shutting off sponsors this way this is
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:08.220]  the future by the way this is this is where the media is going and so
[01:14:08.220 --> 01:14:13.260]  understand folks that I don't even want a big giant studio all the time I don't
[01:14:13.260 --> 01:14:17.020]  need one people want to see how this is real teleprompter free you know I'm
[01:14:17.020 --> 01:14:20.020]  going over there to get a glass of water whatever this is just real people in the
[01:14:20.020 --> 01:14:25.300]  trenches fighting not putting on airs now let's shift gears into how we
[01:14:25.300 --> 01:14:29.340]  counter this and then more importantly into the current election but I really
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:34.060]  see this as a desperation signal by them to openly destroy or start destroying
[01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:38.260]  their Fox franchise with up to 30 other people now saying they're ready to
[01:14:38.260 --> 01:14:43.180]  leave this is seismic folks this is really a political shot around the world
[01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:47.420]  that they would desperately try to threaten us not to have rallies try to
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:51.060]  shut down free speech ban you on all the networks basically ban you everywhere
[01:14:51.060 --> 01:14:54.460]  admit your band everywhere except not admit you've been banned at Fox where I
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:57.180]  know you were consulted the past then suddenly six months you haven't been on
[01:14:57.180 --> 01:15:01.140]  there I mean this is this really shows they're desperate am I right yeah I know
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:05.260]  I have been a contributor at Fox and I have had some notable performances there
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:09.300]  in which I got a chance to lay out the truth but most of the mainstream media
[01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:12.780]  is afraid of the truth here's the biggest point Alex which is if we're
[01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:18.260]  going to persecute Roger Ailes for what I think are very thin charges of sexual
[01:15:18.260 --> 01:15:22.500]  harassment what about Bill Clinton what about Bill Clinton and Juanita Broderick
[01:15:22.500 --> 01:15:28.020]  and Paula Corbin Jones and and the courageous Kathleen Willie and and
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:34.740]  Christie Zurcher Eileen Wellstone Helen Dowdy Becky Brown this list goes on and
[01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:39.180]  on but the mainstream media ignores sexual assault ignores Bill Clinton
[01:15:39.180 --> 01:15:44.100]  exposing himself to women in an aroused state ignores Bill Clinton biting his
[01:15:44.100 --> 01:15:49.860]  victims his his signature move as authenticated by Michael Izakoff then of
[01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:56.100]  time now of Yahoo as authenticated by by the Roger Morris of the Washington Post
[01:15:56.100 --> 01:15:59.940]  these are not these are not exactly left-wing journalists let's be very
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:06.180]  clear Bill Clinton is a real sexual predator and the only reason that Bill
[01:16:06.180 --> 01:16:12.420]  Cosby is being prosecuted and Bill Clinton is not is racism this is racist
[01:16:12.420 --> 01:16:16.460]  and it's time for Bill Clinton to be prosecuted now let's ship yours into the
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:20.220]  current campaign what is Lewandowski who I'm left alone I'm taking the gloves off
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:25.740]  what is the former campaign head after you were the campaign head for Trump what
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:31.900]  on earth is he doing going after the current campaign head and blaming him
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:36.180]  for this Trump speech Mrs. Trump's speech all I know was I looked at most
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:40.900]  speeches the transcripts this is stuff almost everybody says in every speech
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:45.540]  about their roots and where they came from I mean that's like saying Trump
[01:16:45.540 --> 01:16:48.860]  plagiarized make America great again that's from Ronald Reagan that was said
[01:16:48.860 --> 01:16:52.260]  before that too I mean there's certain things like the word titanic you can't
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:58.140]  plagiarize and I just don't think that there's been this problem but even if
[01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:02.260]  there was Obama's been caught clearly plagiarizing his speech writers have
[01:17:02.260 --> 01:17:06.420]  before so much of language has already been used my issue is what is he doing
[01:17:06.420 --> 01:17:10.900]  running around on TV bad-mouthing the current head of the campaign that sounds
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:15.540]  like something a Clinton operative would do well I think it's obvious that he is
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:19.940]  putting his own personal self-interest and his grudges against the election of
[01:17:19.940 --> 01:17:23.460]  the man he professes to say is his friend and who's candidacy he supports
[01:17:23.460 --> 01:17:27.420]  look I think Corey Lewandowski is essentially talentless and that he has
[01:17:27.420 --> 01:17:34.740]  a screw loose his commentary on CNN is inane and self-serving if there was
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:38.700]  plagiarism according to what I just read in the New York Times it appear that it
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:43.220]  is the fault of some person a relatively low level not in the Trump campaign but
[01:17:43.220 --> 01:17:46.860]  at the Trump organization someone who was well-meaning and thought they were
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:49.740]  helping that's what I heard that's what like about them they are so mom and pop
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:54.180]  that they got her words put together a speech and then she gave it to what this
[01:17:54.180 --> 01:17:57.940]  PR friends what I heard to the grapevine that that then just put the standard
[01:17:57.940 --> 01:18:01.060]  thing you put in all speeches about your roots and your family yeah but to say
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:05.940]  that to come out publicly and say that Trump should fire Rick Gates a very
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:10.980]  capable guy who serves as Paul Manafort's right-hand man or Paul Manafort who is
[01:18:10.980 --> 01:18:15.580]  the guy responsible for crushing the Rebellion in the rules committee and
[01:18:15.580 --> 01:18:21.260]  crushing the the the floor fight who is the master political technician when it
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:25.580]  comes to conventions this is not serving the candidate well now I happen to know
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:31.420]  that Lewandowski inebriated last night tried to crash the Trump family box and
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:36.980]  had to be restrained by security guys yes I guess right here this is I don't
[01:18:36.980 --> 01:18:42.100]  know if that's been printed yet we may be breaking news but Corey Lewandowski
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:47.940]  tried to crash the Trump family skybox last night in an inebriated state and
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:52.940]  had to be restrained by security guards this guy is clearly out of his mind I
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:58.340]  think he's probably worried about a story that appeared several weekends ago in
[01:18:58.340 --> 01:19:04.300]  the Washington pardon me in the New York Post allegations of embezzling having
[01:19:04.300 --> 01:19:10.100]  paying inflated prices for t-shirts and hats and posters and then taking a skim
[01:19:10.100 --> 01:19:15.100]  from the vendor now I don't know if that's true but sooner or later I would
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:18.380]  guess there's gonna be a formal investigation so this guy has not only
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:24.340]  it appears damaged tried to damage Trump's candidacy may have stolen from
[01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:31.300]  him and he's obviously out of control I just don't know how well and Donald
[01:19:31.300 --> 01:19:36.180]  Trump Jr. gave an interview earlier today in which he said we know that
[01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:42.140]  Lewandowski is is spreading disinformation about the campaign I heard
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:45.980]  from a journalist last night who told me very breathlessly I understand
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:51.300]  Melania Trump is furious over the speech incident she's blaming Manifor and she
[01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:56.620]  wants Corey Lewandowski back every single part of that is a lie every bit
[01:19:56.620 --> 01:20:00.820]  and under a little bit of cross-examination very clear who her
[01:20:00.820 --> 01:20:04.220]  source was talking to you behind the scenes he's not a conscious saboteur
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:08.980]  he's just an egomaniac buffoon yes I think that's a good characterization
[01:20:08.980 --> 01:20:14.180]  wow well in the in a non he's a buffoon in the non pejorative sense of the work
[01:20:14.180 --> 01:20:18.540]  go ahead wow I tell you well we've covered some of the negative because
[01:20:18.540 --> 01:20:21.420]  that's stuff we've got to deal with the system hitting the panic button because
[01:20:21.420 --> 01:20:25.740]  populism's rising worldwide got Nigel Farage here with huge crowds you know
[01:20:25.740 --> 01:20:29.980]  rock you know rock star you know the Briggs it's happening but the Empire is
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:33.260]  striking back special interest the Republican Democratic machines have
[01:20:33.260 --> 01:20:36.460]  combined forces they've been all meeting in secret around town you know they all
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:39.780]  said they wouldn't go to the convention but they're all here yeah sneaking around
[01:20:39.780 --> 01:20:43.580]  the shadows I've seen some of them so that's been confirmed Romney and the
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:48.260]  rest scurrying about literally at night you know getting into cars and things so
[01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:52.300]  what is a foot in the king's court color they know he's who America wants but
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:57.180]  clearly there's a lot of subterfuge and cloak and bagger and you know different
[01:20:57.180 --> 01:21:01.260]  types of skullduggery taking place yeah I look this is a perfect moment to pay
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:06.660]  homage to a guy who is a real American patriot senator Bob Dole is here he's
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.540]  supporting he's supporting the Trump campaign that I worked for him as a
[01:21:10.540 --> 01:21:15.740]  legislative assistant and I worked in his 1996 campaign he's here he's in his
[01:21:15.740 --> 01:21:20.820]  90s this guy is frail but he's willing to go out and campaign for the Trump
[01:21:20.820 --> 01:21:24.620]  Pence ticket he's doing his party duty now let's contrast him with the bushes
[01:21:24.620 --> 01:21:28.620]  where are they they're not here you know why because they care only about
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:33.240]  themselves they care only about lining their own pockets and they also vacation
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:37.500]  with the Clintons and their pockets and the pockets of their cronies while
[01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:41.580]  their policies have made the country poorer while their policies have made
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:47.100]  jobs almost obsolete in this country so I think it's a great juxtaposition the
[01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:51.540]  the the bushes are criminals I've written a book on this Jeb in the bush crime
[01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:55.340]  family if you haven't seen it you can go to infowars.com and snag it right now
[01:21:55.340 --> 01:22:01.740]  but I put that in stark contrast to a true American patriot a guy who was hit
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:06.980]  by a shell and had to have his entire body reconstructed because of his service
[01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:12.620]  in World War two Bob Dole Bob Dole a true American patriot a giant compared to
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:17.460]  the bushes just a giant the bushes are a bunch of just just I mean they're
[01:22:17.460 --> 01:22:21.820]  there or they're organized crime and and you know they've got so many even
[01:22:21.820 --> 01:22:25.700]  patriots people thinking they're good cuz you know W goes and sees the veterans
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:29.460]  with the hospital and I think W is a lot better than you know you know smell
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:33.340]  like Cheney I don't think he actually ran a lot of stuff but but I mean we're
[01:22:33.340 --> 01:22:36.220]  kind of going back in the past the point is this is all a referendum on the
[01:22:36.220 --> 01:22:40.020]  Clintons and the bushes it's time to put them on the aspen of history it's time
[01:22:40.020 --> 01:22:46.700]  for them to go away yeah look the whole rise of Trump is a rejection of 30 years
[01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:51.380]  of bipartisan treason at a minimum at a maximum of bad decisions at a
[01:22:51.380 --> 01:22:55.900]  minimum by the bushes in the Clintons what have they jointly given us endless
[01:22:55.900 --> 01:23:01.900]  war erosion of our civil liberties massive debt and borrowing bailouts for
[01:23:01.900 --> 01:23:05.300]  the swindlers in the crooks on Wall Street while average people can't find
[01:23:05.300 --> 01:23:11.700]  work and a an expensive ineffective inefficient seemingly incoherent foreign
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:15.780]  policy we're for Iraq no we're for Iran no we're for Iraq maybe we should be for
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:21.140]  Iran we invariably end up facing guns that we've either given people or sold
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:25.020]  people we have a president who can't even figure out I think about Trump Trump
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:28.100]  admits we've been bought off by the communist Chinese that Hillary's an
[01:23:28.100 --> 01:23:31.460]  operative he openly talks about how we're fighting ISIS in al-Qaeda and is
[01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:35.060]  advised by General Flynn that exposed that Obama's running ISIS I mean he is
[01:23:35.060 --> 01:23:38.380]  just everything he's doing he doesn't want war with Russia which the West is
[01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:41.780]  clearly starting not wanting war with Russia is enough for me to support from
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:45.860]  I mean the guy is awesome I've been told that somebody's been a business
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:51.940]  for them and known him for 40 years dr. Jerome Corsi that that and I mean I've
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.940]  been talking to you know of course before when Trump calls him up you know
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:57.020]  the guys know each other pretty well not as well as you do obviously but he said
[01:23:57.020 --> 01:24:00.140]  listen Alex I'm not gonna get into it he said Trump knows everything when it
[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:03.340]  comes to what you know he knew it before you were born about the new world order
[01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:06.700]  and he said he basically has just been keeping quiet the whole time even though
[01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:10.020]  he fought naftan get did some things and the point is now he's sucker punching
[01:24:10.020 --> 01:24:12.380]  on that's why they're crapping their pants and he basically is like a
[01:24:12.380 --> 01:24:16.500]  libertarian sleeper cell is that accurate I think he has a very good fix
[01:24:16.500 --> 01:24:21.300]  about who these enemy countries enemies are he has never been a globalist he's
[01:24:21.300 --> 01:24:25.020]  a nationalist he doesn't believe in the new world order he believes in American
[01:24:25.020 --> 01:24:30.380]  sovereignty he doesn't believe in in their schemes for trade that is barely
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:35.380]  barely on its knees what why attack well he doesn't want war with Russia he
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:38.180]  wants to reach an accommodation with Russia in which everybody can live in
[01:24:38.180 --> 01:24:41.900]  peace Hillary was the one who wants war with Russia because I'm sure she's
[01:24:41.900 --> 01:24:45.460]  taking giant contributions from the munitions factories sorry lady we got
[01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:49.780]  kids we don't want World War three so and I have no doubt had known in Trump
[01:24:49.780 --> 01:24:54.540]  for 40 years Putin would respect Trump he doesn't respect Barack Obama he
[01:24:54.540 --> 01:24:58.620]  laughs at him he's a clown so people say how would you do to put me might
[01:24:58.620 --> 01:25:03.140]  offend him no these guys recognize strength the Russians only recognize
[01:25:03.140 --> 01:25:07.860]  strength Donald Trump is a man of courage he's a man of integrity he has got
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:13.420]  the Cajones to for a face-to-face with with Putin and he will be a peacemaker
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:17.100]  not a war maker if you want war vote for Hillary Clinton she's already

[01:26:57.620 --> 01:27:02.060]  had hoped to a plaster the city with a poster like this but the city fathers
[01:27:02.060 --> 01:27:05.940]  pointed out that there are certain regulations against that but in other
[01:27:05.940 --> 01:27:11.060]  cities while Alex is flying the banners we may just have our snipers are that's
[01:27:11.060 --> 01:27:14.340]  what they call people who post these posters where it's perfectly legal
[01:27:14.340 --> 01:27:19.780]  litter all that the multiple rape cases he raped the country the right
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:23.260]  Iraq he's a rapist absolutely he's a public figure he goes straight to hell

[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:31.740]  communist and you know trying to shut us up so I tried to you know go up there
[01:27:31.740 --> 01:27:34.820]  basically take the flag go to the top they didn't get too happy about their
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:38.780]  stay well look at the other the rally of the day you may have noticed that I was
[01:27:38.780 --> 01:27:42.380]  sweating so profusely that's because I was wearing a bulletproof vest I mean I
[01:27:42.380 --> 01:27:47.500]  get 13 threats that's death threats a day and it's always the same person it's
[01:27:47.500 --> 01:27:52.180]  the same breathy male voice that sounds amazingly like Joe Connison I don't think
[01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:58.060]  it is Joe Connison but sure sounds like him so it is it is incredible that they
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:02.980]  blame us for our tactics for we're violent thugs we're the bad guys but
[01:28:02.980 --> 01:28:06.980]  these people are threatening my family had a guy called me this morning 625 in
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:10.300]  the morning I've got a bullet with your name on it I've got a second bullet with
[01:28:10.300 --> 01:28:14.620]  Trump's name on it hangs up tired of this crap I'm just tired of it those are
[01:28:14.620 --> 01:28:19.620]  the tactics well the Soros funded left I've informed the the the authorities
[01:28:19.620 --> 01:28:23.660]  and frankly I've always believed it's those who threaten you that won't hurt
[01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:27.020]  you it's the ones who don't threaten you who I was about to say though they're
[01:28:27.020 --> 01:28:30.900]  scared that's why they're trying to bring down Fox right now I mean this is
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:34.020]  history is happening people should be really excited and notice their
[01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:37.540]  intimidation hasn't worked thousands of patriots are here we outnumber the

[01:30:11.340 --> 01:30:15.340]  vaccine and it was tested on a small scale in a 50-person experiment to
[01:30:15.340 --> 01:30:19.860]  measure immune response Linda Gail Becker director of the Desmond Tutu HIV
[01:30:19.860 --> 01:30:23.380]  Center in Cape Town and leading the vaccine trials claims that the small
[01:30:23.380 --> 01:30:27.260]  scale test was quote to see if the vaccine looks promising the vaccine
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:32.020]  stems from a 2009 trial in Thailand which resulted in 60% protection against

[01:33:05.020 --> 01:33:10.220]  in the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of
[01:33:10.220 --> 01:33:15.540]  unwarranted influence whether sought or unsought by the military industrial
[01:33:15.540 --> 01:33:20.180]  commemoration in Dallas Texas three shots were fired at president Kennedy's
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:25.020]  motorcade in downtown Dallas the first report to say that president Kennedy
[01:33:25.020 --> 01:33:34.260]  has been seriously wounded by this shooting it is a big idea a new order
[01:33:34.260 --> 01:33:47.260]  it was almost as if it were a planned enclosures it's just pancake. Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:33:47.260 --> 01:34:07.260]  I also believe a lot of gun owners would agree that the AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers not the hands of criminals.
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:13.260]  The guns will be taken no one will be able to be armed. We will take all the guns.
[01:34:13.260 --> 01:34:18.260]  For many of the police and guard troops it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:34:18.260 --> 01:34:26.260]  Global governance at last is it one world the central bank is in charge but aren't we all just living and dying from what the central banks do.
[01:34:26.260 --> 01:34:30.260]  And for me give me liberty or give me death.
[01:34:32.260 --> 01:34:37.260]  Live from the info wars.com studios it's Alex Jones.
[01:34:37.260 --> 01:34:47.260]  Alright ladies and gentlemen we are back live I was just getting like 15 people out of here during the break.
[01:34:47.260 --> 01:34:54.260]  Ted Nugent is scheduled to be calling in there's always time zone issues and things like that he is on the road going city to city.
[01:34:54.260 --> 01:35:03.260]  Notice Ted Nugent is not at the RNC this year because he was not invited the RNC itself kept him off the list.
[01:35:03.260 --> 01:35:07.260]  I don't blame Trump for that I blame some of the people that quote don't want Trump to be too radical.
[01:35:07.260 --> 01:35:13.260]  Well it's radicalism in the face of radicalism that is no vice to paraphrase Barry Goldwater.
[01:35:13.260 --> 01:35:25.260]  At least I am a plagiarism here on air but as they say stealing is the at least words and ideas is the most sincere form of flattery.
[01:35:25.260 --> 01:35:33.260]  And I forget who said that but I'm not being a little bit sarcastic now about the fact that they're claiming that Mrs. Trump is engaged in all of that.
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:44.260]  But what overshadows everything and what really is the big issue that everyone should be looking at is that they're trying to have a coup d'etat at Fox.
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:50.260]  I mean that really is the big inch a lot this is a big deal Fox this signals everything Drudge said is dead on.
[01:35:50.260 --> 01:35:58.260]  No Drudge was legitimate and was really told that and I've been told similar things but this shows that that intel he got from that individual and others was accurate.
[01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:04.260]  This is the year they're trying to come up with free speech they're not doing too well and it's blown over their face in Europe as well.
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:19.260]  But I tell you very very exciting to just know that there's patriots here and I was just talking to John Ronson who's obviously a famous author and researcher who was also here while we had Stone in studio
[01:36:19.260 --> 01:36:27.260]  and he was telling me a lot of behind the scenes things and he said why haven't you talked about the fact that they're chanting Hillary for prison Hillary for prison on the delegate floor.
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:33.260]  And why haven't you talked about the fact that basically people are shouting you know stuff from your show.
[01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:41.260]  And I said listen I know that's going on but I'm in a war I got to just move on to the next thing and when I tell you about the success we're having it so you know you're having success.
[01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:51.260]  It's because a lot of folks obviously aren't prominent they're not known people don't recognize them so you don't realize that you're not losing that you're winning.
[01:36:51.260 --> 01:37:05.260]  And yes it is exciting to hear my talking points my research my terms my angles smashing through the disinformation and being all over mainline talk radio all over Fox they're fighting to keep it off CNN MSNBC they are scared to death.
[01:37:05.260 --> 01:37:11.260]  But listen I am not the inventor of this I am not plagiarizing it either.
[01:37:11.260 --> 01:37:25.260]  I am enjoying the birthright of a person who wants to be part of the new Renaissance the the system of Americana not the problems we've had but the good things we've had that no one could deny where the best world ever saw.
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:35.260]  And I really am just wanting you to know that you are the leadership you are the resistance and that's not to make you feel important it's because that's how we're going to beat these people.
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:48.260]  There's no way they can shut all of us down and I tell you my one big frustration is when I'm out walking on the street or I'm whether it's Austin Texas or Cleveland Ohio and there's all these great men and women.
[01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:57.260]  Every race, color and creed that want to shake my hand want to take photos of me want to talk to me. I'm too busy getting to the next place to fight the globalist to sit there and talk to you.
[01:37:57.260 --> 01:37:59.260]  And I tell you hey I love you you're great I got to go.
[01:37:59.260 --> 01:38:06.260]  And so I just want folks to know because I've run people for that have had their feelings heard that listen we're not playing games here.
[01:38:06.260 --> 01:38:08.260]  Okay we are taking action.
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:18.260]  Okay and when you look at somebody like Ted Nugent or you look at somebody like Nigel Farage or you look at somebody like Donald Trump or you look at somebody like Matt Drudge.
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:23.260]  These are people that are putting everything on the line because they don't want to be slaves.
[01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:32.260]  These are people that are are defending this republic and it's that spirit they're trying to extinguish because it's that spirit that will bring them down and Ted Nugent is now on the line.
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:44.260]  Of course the Motor City madman. This is the guy who carries the mantle in the United States now basically of Chuck Heston and the Second Amendment and I would say he absolutely fills those shoes and more.
[01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:48.260]  I am very honored to be seen as a staunch defender and I am of course of the Second Amendment.
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:59.260]  But I tell you we need more of these prominent leaders to get even more hardcore because it's Ted Nugent's no nonsense you in their face that has helped us realize we're under attack.
[01:38:59.260 --> 01:39:06.260]  He's raised the alarm. So joining us is a true modern Paul Revere. Ted Nugent thanks for coming on with us.
[01:39:06.260 --> 01:39:09.260]  Well thanks Alice. I appreciate those kind words.
[01:39:09.260 --> 01:39:18.260]  I bring you self-evident truth and common sense and logic from the not so mean streets of America traveling all over this country as I have for the last 50 years.
[01:39:18.260 --> 01:39:23.260]  And what Alex Jones represents what Ted Nugent represents is not alone.
[01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:30.260]  It really is the heart and soul of this country and I see and hear it feel it and celebrate it every day of my life.
[01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:38.260]  So be strong be stronger be more absolute and know that we the people are with you 100 percent.
[01:39:38.260 --> 01:39:46.260]  Absolutely. If this was a war which it is how would you describe it as a general at what point have we reached.
[01:39:46.260 --> 01:39:52.260]  I mean I see the tide turning against tyrants worldwide. The problem is they're they're digging their heels in.
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:40:01.260]  Well the dumbing down of America was on the fast track and it's come to fruition when you've got you know social movements based 100 percent on lies.
[01:40:01.260 --> 01:40:05.260]  The Black Lives Matter is the most embarrassing of all.
[01:40:05.260 --> 01:40:11.260]  And you've got so-called leaders like Barack Obama whose entire career is based on a line.
[01:40:11.260 --> 01:40:18.260]  You've got Loretta Lynch literally committing glaring crimes in public tampering with evidence in Orlando.
[01:40:18.260 --> 01:40:28.260]  Then you've got the poster child for Saul Alinsky's book dedicated to Satan and Hillary Clinton and the whole list of liberal Democrats.
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:36.260]  And horribly Alex so much of the Republican Party has just been a shadow of the freaks and on the left.
[01:40:36.260 --> 01:40:44.260]  I believe that the culture war has finally awakened a we the people fist in this fight.
[01:40:44.260 --> 01:40:50.260]  I believe that the record numbers coming out for Donald Trump who is anything but perfect.
[01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:57.260]  But compared to what the Democrats have put forth a lying felon criminal scam artist like Hillary Clinton and a communist.
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:02.260]  Are you kidding me. Bernie Sanders actually had people show up and cheer him on.
[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:07.260]  In the face of that absurdity Donald Trump almost comes off as Michael the Archangel.
[01:41:07.260 --> 01:41:15.260]  So I see an awakening from this self inflicted embarrassing soulless curse of apathy and disconnect.
[01:41:15.260 --> 01:41:23.260]  Finally people in the asset column of America are realizing that we're being taken advantage of by this administration
[01:41:23.260 --> 01:41:26.260]  and this government this media and academia.
[01:41:26.260 --> 01:41:29.260]  And I see I see a giant awakening out here.
[01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:38.260]  I'm I'm on tour every day all summer long and what what what makes America strong is finally waking up.
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:43.260]  So I think the prognosis is better now than in the years that you and I have known each other.
[01:41:43.260 --> 01:41:51.260]  I bring you positive spirits downright a warrior effervescence on the not so mean streets of this country.
[01:41:51.260 --> 01:41:54.260]  Absolutely. And folks know that I don't give people cheerleader reports.
[01:41:54.260 --> 01:41:55.260]  You don't either.
[01:41:55.260 --> 01:42:01.260]  Maybe you've come on the show for probably off and on for like 15 years and you know we've had some really negative broadcasts
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:05.260]  where we admit how down we are not to be fear mongering not to be a negative.
[01:42:05.260 --> 01:42:08.260]  But just to tell folks we're down in the ditch getting our asses kicked.
[01:42:08.260 --> 01:42:12.260]  But now we've gotten up and the enemy is getting their butt politically kicked.
[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:16.260]  The problem is they're going to pull out the stops and I want to talk about that with Ted Nugent of Ted Nugent dot com.
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:23.260]  Also of course writes syndicated columns so much more go see him on his sold out tours when you can around the country.
[01:42:23.260 --> 01:42:30.260]  But Ted I have the inside scoop from Fox from three different people that are currently there.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:32.260]  One of them very high up.
[01:42:32.260 --> 01:42:35.260]  I knew about this about a year ago six months ago intensified.
[01:42:35.260 --> 01:42:37.260]  I knew it was coming about a week ago.
[01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:40.260]  Fake sexual harassment claims.
[01:42:40.260 --> 01:42:44.260]  Megan Kelly saying you know that Roger else hugged her too hard six years ago.
[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:51.260]  And this is some of the Murdoch people with Hillary basically trying to take over Fox.
[01:42:51.260 --> 01:42:54.260]  That's why Hannity and a bunch of others are threatening to leave.
[01:42:54.260 --> 01:43:02.260]  This is unprecedented that the Clinton machine and the Obama machine is literally threatening to fire Hannity and people behind the scenes.
[01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.260]  If he talks about Bill Clinton's record with women.
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:06.260]  I mean there's major censorship for me.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:14.260]  That's a bellwether of an attempted coup that's ongoing at Fox News right now really shows us that we're two minutes to midnight here.
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:16.260]  These people know they can't beat our information.
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:19.260]  So now they're trying to shut us up.
[01:43:19.260 --> 01:43:21.260]  We've seen that forever.
[01:43:21.260 --> 01:43:26.260]  I mean I started this culture well Alex back in the 1960s when I was doing rock and roll radio interviews.
[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:36.260]  And people you know the disc jockeys the stoners in the music industry would ask me where all my piss and vinegar and fire and passion for the music comes from.
[01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:45.260]  And I'd explain that I was raised in the shadow of Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley and little Richard James Brown and Wilson Pickett and celebrate those great black founding fathers.
[01:43:45.260 --> 01:43:54.260]  I would also insert how I just wrapped up a wonderful weekend with my dad and brother's mom and sister in the deer hunting camp and I was aimed small,
[01:43:54.260 --> 01:43:58.260]  Miss small disciplined in the world of hunting and the outdoor lifestyle.
[01:43:58.260 --> 01:44:03.260]  And these people would freak out that I murdered innocent animals.
[01:44:03.260 --> 01:44:09.260]  I mean the culture war started when the insanity of animal rights came to be.
[01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:15.260]  When they find out that I carried a gun and that I believed in self defense and these hippies were aghast.
[01:44:15.260 --> 01:44:16.260]  I mean they just began.
[01:44:16.260 --> 01:44:21.260]  How dare you carry a gun when every free man in history carried a weapon.
[01:44:21.260 --> 01:44:35.260]  So I was being attacked and condemned and ostracized for what can only be described as the perfect human responsibility of defending one's life and balancing the herds and eating venison.
[01:44:35.260 --> 01:44:47.260]  Those two elements, the hunting lifestyle and the second amendment were the tip of the culture war spear when it started because the hippies couldn't believe that I would kill an innocent animal.
[01:44:47.260 --> 01:44:55.260]  And by the way, even folks that love you for decades and don't know the lore of Ted Nugent, I know a lot of it and I don't mean to be kissing your butter,
[01:44:55.260 --> 01:45:01.260]  but it is cool to see how long ago you were basically doing what I've been doing for 20 years, 40, 50 years ago.
[01:45:01.260 --> 01:45:04.260]  It's just crazy, Ted.
[01:45:04.260 --> 01:45:05.260]  It really was.
[01:45:05.260 --> 01:45:06.260]  It struck me.
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:11.260]  You know, I, I, I pierced my lips and burrowed my brow and I went, wait a minute.
[01:45:11.260 --> 01:45:22.260]  So you think I'm an idiot for not snorting cocaine and stuff, but that I should be jailed for and a second amendment participant.
[01:45:22.260 --> 01:45:25.260]  Really, that, that's the premise of your hate for me.
[01:45:25.260 --> 01:45:35.260]  Until the Saul Alinsky machine work started running amok and they would call me a racist and a homophobe and a, and a draft dodger and an anti-semi.
[01:45:35.260 --> 01:45:40.260]  You know, all the, all the knee jerk dishonesty from the left, if they can't debate you.
[01:45:40.260 --> 01:45:51.260]  And of course, if the left cannot debate me because I'll eat their family tree and spit sawdust like I did on Texas public television and to our friend, Pierce Morgan.
[01:45:51.260 --> 01:46:02.260]  And, and so they would immediately begin to attack me personally and claim that I can't play guitar and that I'm a homophobe when I actually am none of the things that they claim I am.
[01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:04.260]  So I take that as a badge of honor.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:11.260]  But what you're seeing it box, what you're seeing from the, the unbelievable power of the Clinton machinery.
[01:46:11.260 --> 01:46:28.260]  These people can meet with Loretta Lynch and she can actually violate her oath to the Constitution and edit the tapes from the Orlando shooting 911 calls without a flinch, without any sense of accountability.
[01:46:28.260 --> 01:46:38.260]  Knowing she's immune from prosecution because the president hired her based on the color of her skin, not the content of her character.
[01:46:38.260 --> 01:46:57.260]  And that statement I just made alone will so infuriate the leftist America hating media and academia and the government punks and thugs that hate Ted Nugent and hate Alex Jones and hate the Constitution, hate freedom, hate the, the, the Pledge of Allegiance.
[01:46:57.260 --> 01:46:59.260]  They hate everything good about people.
[01:46:59.260 --> 01:47:01.260]  Everything good about him.
[01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:04.260]  I could not be more proud.
[01:47:04.260 --> 01:47:14.260]  And by the way, Ted Nugent, you're saying all this, it's just pure veritas. It's just happy. I think you're the only guess we have on where it's just all like, just like, like absolute veritas.
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:19.260]  It's just every word is absolutely totally true. They have inverted reality. They're the most anti liberal people.
[01:47:19.260 --> 01:47:26.260]  I think of liberal as Thomas Jefferson, more freedom, lower taxes, you know, every person in right to defend themselves, maximum individual liberty. That's liberal.
[01:47:26.260 --> 01:47:34.260]  These people aren't liberal. I think it's time to really calm what they are. Just a bunch of scum and criminals and losers that want to control reality and run our lives.
[01:47:34.260 --> 01:47:41.260]  And I tell you, more and more of the grassroots so-called leftists are getting off the plantation. I, I really see that happening.
[01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:44.260]  But, but in your gut, what else are you really concerned about?
[01:47:44.260 --> 01:47:54.260]  Obviously, you know, communists, black lives matter, Obama refusing to repudiate him saying, you know, the cops need to reform themselves, implying the death of police is a good thing.
[01:47:54.260 --> 01:48:00.260]  I mean, I don't understand the disconnect. How does Obama think he's going to get away with starting the civil war in the country?
[01:48:00.260 --> 01:48:05.260]  Or do I have a blind spot? I mean, does he have a chance? What's he doing?
[01:48:05.260 --> 01:48:16.260]  I don't think he has a chance. We see these isolated events of outrageous demonisy by the sniper in Dallas and the, the murderer in Baton Rouge.
[01:48:16.260 --> 01:48:24.260]  Right after those horrific events, attacking the heroes of law enforcement, Alex, I was with the Dallas Police Department.
[01:48:24.260 --> 01:48:27.260]  I happened to have trained with some of these guys and I worked with these guys.
[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:33.260]  And just last night, we were in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and I met with a bunch of the heroes of law enforcement there.
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:46.260]  But more importantly than those law enforcement warriors are the enormous crowds, the armies of we, the people who stand with law and order and law enforcement.
[01:48:46.260 --> 01:48:56.260]  So I don't believe that even as a dishonest, America-hating, anti-constitutionalist that we have as the Commander-in-Chief,
[01:48:56.260 --> 01:49:05.260]  I don't believe that even the power that he has with all those Communist buddies like Van Jones and Loretta Lynch and, and Valerie Jarrett,
[01:49:05.260 --> 01:49:14.260]  I don't think they're going to overwhelm we, the people. It got close there for a while because of the apathy and the allowing of the dumbing down of America.
[01:49:14.260 --> 01:49:25.260]  But I hang with people every day, Alex. I have meetings every day with people with charities, children's charities, military charities, conservation charities,
[01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:29.260]  working hard, playing hard Americans that sacrifice and take risks.
[01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:41.260]  And by the way, statistics show, that's right, major studies in Canada and the UK show that conservatives and libertarians worldwide and Christians and patriots give six times more money than liberals
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:50.260]  and just do so much more good stuff and that the left, again, is six times more likely to rob. I mean, the left are just criminals.
[01:49:50.260 --> 01:49:58.260]  There's no question about that. Let me give you an example. I know a lot of people would just think that this is an isolated example, but I get it all the time.
[01:49:58.260 --> 01:50:08.260]  And if I was on the radio with you every day, I could give you a dozen examples like this every day, where an ultra-liberal radio guy, a disc jockey,
[01:50:08.260 --> 01:50:13.260]  who I've been working with for about 40-plus years, we recently did an interview in Detroit.
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:21.260]  And during the interview, he said, this is going to be very difficult for me, Ted, but I want to publicly state live on the air my apology to you,
[01:50:21.260 --> 01:50:29.260]  because I always ridiculed you and made fun of you and condemned you for your politics going back to the 60s and 70s and 80s.
[01:50:29.260 --> 01:50:41.260]  And I just want to publicly state that I was wrong and you were right. Now that I have woke up, now that I have educated myself to what is going on in our government
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:51.260]  and so much of the media and academia, those are the best tryouts of power abuse and criminality. Government, media, and academia.
[01:50:51.260 --> 01:50:53.260]  He apologized to me and he's a liberal guy, Alex.
[01:50:53.260 --> 01:51:14.260]  That's amazing. Stay there. Final statement with Ted Nugent. I just realized something. Ted Nugent is like the original info warrior of the last century.
[01:51:23.260 --> 01:51:30.260]  Take your business to the next level. That's advertise.gcnlive.com.
[01:51:53.260 --> 01:52:07.260]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:52:07.260 --> 01:52:13.260]  Here's why. My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse. So please listen.
[01:52:13.260 --> 01:52:23.260]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power. And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:52:23.260 --> 01:52:30.260]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:52:30.260 --> 01:52:37.260]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[01:52:37.260 --> 01:52:44.260]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for info wars listeners.
[01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:53.260]  So it's a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com. It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:52:53.260 --> 01:53:08.260]  Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[01:53:23.260 --> 01:53:28.260]  Feel the thrill. Only at slingbow.com.
[01:53:54.260 --> 01:54:00.260]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:05.260]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:35.260]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:05.260]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:55:30.260 --> 01:55:41.260]  From military heroes from Delta Force and the Army Rangers and the Green Berets and all those special hops, these guys use the song Stranglehold to gear up to go into battle.
[01:55:41.260 --> 01:55:51.260]  And they tell me that whenever they listen to my music before they go into battle, they kill more bad guys. Now is there a better testimony to meaningful music than that?
[01:55:51.260 --> 01:56:00.260]  Well, I mean, it's like Beethoven, but rock, the way it just builds. It's a perfect song. It's a perfect song.
[01:56:00.260 --> 01:56:04.260]  You should see it from where I see it every night. I mean, it's just unbelievable.
[01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:08.260]  How did you come up? I mean, you come up with so much incredible stuff, but how did you come up with that?
[01:56:08.260 --> 01:56:22.260]  Well, first of all, I was raised in a hunting lifestyle, so that aim small, miss small, ballistic ballet that you have to adhere to to be a good deer hunter and to compete with my dad and my brothers at the firing range.
[01:56:22.260 --> 01:56:30.260]  I'm going to tell you there's something about sight acquisition, breathing and trigger squeeze that actually applies to guitar playing if you do it right.
[01:56:30.260 --> 01:56:41.260]  So every time I pick up, I play a Gibson Birdland and this hand-carved arch-topped jazz guitar made by American craftsmen in Kalamazoo, Michigan,
[01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:56.260]  it is the embodiment of what God wanted wood to be used for, and it has such a resonance, such a tapestry, such an unlimited topography of sounds and tones and voices that it feeds back and it makes these noises
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:57:01.260]  and it forces you to hold it and cradle it and touch it in a certain way.
[01:57:01.260 --> 01:57:11.260]  And because I was raised by these black gods of thunder, the howl and wolf and the muddy waters, and I was born in the shadow of Detroit's Motown Funk Brother gods of thunder,
[01:57:11.260 --> 01:57:16.260]  that that all manifests itself in the way that I play guitar.
[01:57:16.260 --> 01:57:28.260]  And so that lick, it embodies so much of the human spirit of defiance and not just the sexuality that is apparent to the rhythm and the grind of the rhythm section,
[01:57:28.260 --> 01:57:32.260]  but the volatility of the lyrics. Here I come again now, baby.
[01:57:32.260 --> 01:57:38.260]  But it does raise confidence. I'm starting to rub. It does raise your confidence.
[01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:46.260]  Well, I tell you, there's only one thing more dangerous than a grizzly, a South grizzly with cubs, and that's Ted Nugent with more confidence.
[01:57:46.260 --> 01:57:54.260]  And since I play that song every night, I do believe that the founding fathers wanted everybody to be like me. That's what I believe.
[01:57:54.260 --> 01:58:01.260]  Well, Ted, again, I think what you're saying here today is America's finding its spirit again, isn't it?
[01:58:01.260 --> 01:58:10.260]  It really is. And I got to tell you, Alex, you travel, you gregarious guy, you hang with working hard, playing hard Americans.
[01:58:10.260 --> 01:58:18.260]  And I do every day. I'm in Naples, Florida today, and I'll be hanging out with 20 people tonight at the concert in Jacksonville and tomorrow in Melbourne and Papano,
[01:58:18.260 --> 01:58:30.260]  and up in Clearwater and Atlanta and Mobile and Boosier City and Illenup. Every night I hang with people in the asset column, people who sacrifice so they're in the asset column.
[01:58:30.260 --> 01:58:33.260]  It's amazing. Five more minutes, Ted Nugent. We're back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:33.260 --> 01:58:37.260]  TedNugent.com. I'm Alex Jones, live from the RNCMFullWars.com.
[01:58:37.260 --> 01:58:42.260]  Back in 70 seconds. We're five more minutes with Ted Nugent.
[01:58:42.260 --> 01:58:49.260]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:49.260 --> 01:59:07.260]  I've been working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8.30. I was kind of run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[01:59:07.260 --> 01:59:16.260]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right there. I popped two of them. And about 20 minutes later, it's like, everything just kind of clears up.
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:29.260]  It's got four and a half stars. People really love it. Read about it. Find out why. Third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic-based systems that will blow your socks off.
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:33.260]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without brain force.
[01:59:33.260 --> 01:59:39.260]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain force and came in.
[01:59:39.260 --> 01:59:48.260]  You will find brain force and other game-changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[02:00:09.260 --> 02:00:22.260]  Live from Austin, Texas. Broadcasting statewide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:28.260]  As much as I like Junior Brown on the still guitar, I like Ted Newgen Moore, but I'd say it's hard to...
[02:00:28.260 --> 02:00:34.260]  Just to hear the human soul coming out, the individualism of these guitar players, I mean, I think the guitar more than anything really brings out the human soul.
[02:00:34.260 --> 02:00:41.260]  That's another entertainment radio show, but I think it's celebrating the fact that we're independent, we're individuals.
[02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:46.260]  The way the left loves ugliness, the way they love poverty, the way they love...
[02:00:46.260 --> 02:00:52.260]  Quite frankly, Ted, I'm not just saying this. I think at the end of the day, the left really are just Satanists.
[02:00:52.260 --> 02:00:55.260]  What do you think?
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:01:04.260]  To be honest, what Ben Carson said last night is being attacked for. Saul Linsky did write the Bible for the left.
[02:01:04.260 --> 02:01:10.260]  Literally what Valerie Jarrett genuflexed to every time she writes words for Barack Obama.
[02:01:10.260 --> 02:01:14.260]  Barack Obama has been caught lying over and over again his entire life.
[02:01:14.260 --> 02:01:23.260]  Valerie Jarrett, make sure that his speeches are full of lies that feel good and will continue to enslave the sheep on the left.
[02:01:23.260 --> 02:01:30.260]  But that book rules for radicals. The first page, Alex, it was dedicated to Satan, the great manipulator.
[02:01:30.260 --> 02:01:39.260]  And that's the author and the book that Hillary Clinton mentored under when she wrote her law degree thesis on solitude.
[02:01:39.260 --> 02:01:44.260]  Oh yeah, she wrote him love letters, like letters back and forth with him. Just totally sick.
[02:01:44.260 --> 02:01:55.260]  So no, the media does not expose this important information and they don't condemn the lies of Hillary and Loretta Lynch and Valerie Jarrett and Barack Obama
[02:01:55.260 --> 02:02:00.260]  and Ben Jones and all their acorns scam artists and their media matters.
[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:06.260]  Move on.org, Huffington Post, Southern Poverty Law Center, scam artists and liars.
[02:02:06.260 --> 02:02:18.260]  So logically speaking, those of us in the asset column, we have to live by logic and common sense and practical, pragmatic, utilitarian accountability.
[02:02:18.260 --> 02:02:27.260]  You cannot find accountability in the government, in the media, or in academia.
[02:02:27.260 --> 02:02:36.260]  So we're challenged to why? We can't answer the question why in a logical way.
[02:02:36.260 --> 02:02:43.260]  So we just have to admit what you asked about demonisy, about Satanism, that's the only answer.
[02:02:43.260 --> 02:02:51.260]  They hate success, they hate excellence, they hate productivity, they hate everything in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:56.260]  So I couldn't be more proud. I don't want those punks to like me.
[02:02:56.260 --> 02:03:01.260]  I want them to be afraid of me. I want them to hate me. I want them to lie about me.
[02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:08.260]  I am so proud that the enemies of America hate Ted Nugent. I can hardly stand myself.
[02:03:08.260 --> 02:03:19.260]  Well, you know, you are totally on target. It's a badge of honor to have these culture-destroying scum hate us and it is a badge of honor.
[02:03:19.260 --> 02:03:29.260]  Families to them says, man, hundreds of newspapers attacked you this week. How are you taking it? And I'm like, the enemy newspapers that literally are undermining this country and promoting cop killing and all the rest is crazy crap.
[02:03:29.260 --> 02:03:34.260]  They hate me. Thank God. If they like me, I've got a serious, serious problem.
[02:03:34.260 --> 02:03:40.260]  TedNugent.com, I mean, you've got so many millions of followers on Facebook and there's so many other big websites.
[02:03:40.260 --> 02:03:45.260]  Where are the best places for people to stay in contact on a daily basis with everything Ted Nugent?
[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:51.260]  Well, I'll tell you, Alex, I am humbled at the tens of millions every day on my Facebook.
[02:03:51.260 --> 02:04:03.260]  I have a Ted Nugent official Facebook and people come from all around the world to celebrate the self-evident truth of the American dream, the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence.
[02:04:03.260 --> 02:04:09.260]  I'm telling you, it is not a Ted Nugent thing. It is a people honesty thing.
[02:04:09.260 --> 02:04:20.260]  So my Facebook, I get on numerous times every day and I have great communications about rock and roll and about politics and about quality of life and about logic and about goodwill and decency.
[02:04:20.260 --> 02:04:33.260]  So I am encouraged every day that more and more people are waking up to the scourge of what Obama represents, a scourge that the media represents and I couldn't be more confident or proud right now.
[02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:40.260]  Well, Ted, thank you so much for your time. I know we're both Central Texans and so hopefully sometime I can go out hunting with you.
[02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:54.260]  That's always been something I wanted to do, but thank you for your time. Thank you for your energy and I want to thank my audience for what they do, magnifying what InfoWars is up to, but also what you're doing because now is the time to push it to the hilt because the enemy is going to pull a lot of scams.
[02:04:54.260 --> 02:04:56.260]  Ted Nugent, thank you so much, sir.
[02:04:56.260 --> 02:05:07.260]  Godspeed, Alex. You're on my blood, brother. Thank you, man. All right. Time to get serious. There's a new HIV vaccine to be trialed in South Africa later this year.
[02:05:07.260 --> 02:05:26.260]  It was tested on a small scale in a 50 person experiment to measure immune response. Linda Gail Becker, director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Center in Cape Town and leading the vaccine trials claims that the small scale test was quote to see if the vaccine looks promising.
[02:05:26.260 --> 02:05:43.260]  The vaccine stems from a 2009 trial in Thailand, which resulted in 60% protection against HIV the first year, but afterward falling to 30% before the trials end. Gail Becker, in addition to Anthony Fauci, also working on the trial, intend to add adjuvants to strengthen the vaccine's potency.
[02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:52.260]  Oh yeah, like that's going to go over well. And wait people know what mass vaccine trials could possibly mean. Prepare the genocide preparations.
[02:05:52.260 --> 02:05:59.260]  Here's a article on CNN.com. This is Gabe Goldimand for info wars.com.

[02:07:04.260 --> 02:07:23.260]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[02:07:23.260 --> 02:07:31.260]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[02:07:31.260 --> 02:07:41.260]  All of a sudden there's so many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[02:07:41.260 --> 02:07:50.260]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday. Living defense info wars life.com and folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body. Period.

[02:08:00.260 --> 02:08:05.260]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[02:08:05.260 --> 02:08:14.260]  Watch me. Watch me. I got it. Watch me. I got it.
[02:08:14.260 --> 02:08:26.260]  I tell you, I am in heaven right now at the RNC. We got a big interview today with Nigel Farage. It's going to come out tonight. We just had Ted Nugent on. We just had Roger Stone in studio with us with huge positive news.
[02:08:26.260 --> 02:08:39.260]  We've got Dinesh D'Souza at the Reagan administration who was a speechwriter headed up departments. You name it. Who is a political prisoner, which to me is a great badge of honor like Alexander Schultz and Ethan.
[02:08:39.260 --> 02:08:48.260]  I mean, literally set up and but he's now has made the film Hillary's America that I got in late. Didn't get to go see it Sunday when it premiered.
[02:08:48.260 --> 02:09:00.260]  And my crew that saw it said it is so hardcore. 2016 was the second biggest grossing documentary in US history or I guess world history and really did wake a lot of people up.
[02:09:00.260 --> 02:09:11.260]  But I thought it wasn't hardcore enough. It was totally in grossing and I love the film, but he's a nice guy. Well, they came after him for that because they're scared of him.
[02:09:11.260 --> 02:09:20.260]  Well, now he's made a film that is hardcore and because I talked to my crew and their filmmakers and they said this thing. If people see this, it's over for Hillary. Let me explain how this works though.
[02:09:20.260 --> 02:09:27.260]  They have theaters and they pulled these games and movies I've been in where they try to not show them and advertise them. They don't want when films first go out.
[02:09:27.260 --> 02:09:32.260]  They don't want them to be successful because then they get picked up by the theaters. I know folks understand that.
[02:09:32.260 --> 02:09:41.260]  But if you want to strike a blow with Hillary Clinton, I'm going to say this out of the gates before we go. This guy is sitting there listening to me rant. But I'm sorry. I mean, I'm going to war against Hillary. I know you are too. I mean, against this tyrant.
[02:09:41.260 --> 02:09:50.260]  You've got to take ten of your friends. Be aggressive. I want you to take your Rotary Club. I want you to take your neighbors. I want you to take your parents. I want you to take your kids.
[02:09:50.260 --> 02:10:00.260]  I want you to take your whole office to this, especially brainwashed leftists. I don't even call liberals. These are anti-liberal authoritarians masquerading with camouflages liberals.
[02:10:00.260 --> 02:10:08.260]  Thomas Jefferson was a liberal. These are no liberals. The Nessha Souza to me is a classical liberal that you'd call that a paleoconservative. These terms mean nothing.
[02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:18.260]  They've scrambled everything. They've inverted reality. I talked to Ted Nugent. I would like them to Satanist. I mean, you know, Saul Linsky is their God. He pledged his book to Lucifer.
[02:10:18.260 --> 02:10:28.260]  And Hillary is trying to invert reality. She was pin pals with this guy. So this is what we're dealing with. I mean, like communists yesterday attacking me and screaming racist.
[02:10:28.260 --> 02:10:40.260]  I've never done anything racist. You know, my sister's adopted from South Korea. I grew up in Dallas, Texas. My friends are black. But this is how they operate, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:40.260 --> 02:10:47.260]  This is how they get their agenda through. So you need to go see the film. You need to find out where it is on their website. You need to go religiously.
[02:10:47.260 --> 02:11:00.260]  Because if this film goes viral like 2016, this, I believe, and I'm sure of it. Just like I told you by the Hillary for prison shirts, and it would become a meme, number one meme on the Internet in the last three weeks, four different times now.
[02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:11.260]  It's freaking everyone out that 15, 20%, sometimes 30% of people are wearing them here at the RNC. They're chanting it on the floor. They can't stop the signal. The Clinton right's coming out.
[02:11:11.260 --> 02:11:22.260]  We can break through their Berlin wall. We're the people. But I'm telling you, this weapon forged in Vulcan Smithy down under the volcano. Use the black arrow that'll take down smog.
[02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:32.260]  So I'm mixing two different metaphors there. You absolutely must go see Hillary's America or you're putting Hillary Clinton in office. This guy has been persecuted and thrown in prison.
[02:11:32.260 --> 02:11:41.260]  Now, I'm done ranting, but I tell you, you're a hero to my family, my children. I can tell you, I'm right up there in the same firing line with you. You've been walking point for so long.
[02:11:41.260 --> 02:11:45.260]  As soon as we admire you, sir, and you're obviously only stronger after what you've gone through, sir.
[02:11:45.260 --> 02:11:59.260]  Yeah, I think this experience, Alex, of having just been locked up by the Obama administration in the wake of a technical violation of the campaign finance laws, when I began to see that no American has ever gone to prison for doing what I did.
[02:11:59.260 --> 02:12:06.260]  And then when I see what Hillary gets away with, I mean, it's clear to me that we have now lawlessness at the highest levels of our society.
[02:12:06.260 --> 02:12:16.260]  And it kind of changes the rules of American politics because the way I came of age in the Reagan era, and I was kind of living in the pointy headed intellectual world at think tanks.
[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:24.260]  I kind of got the idea, American politics is a gentleman's fight between two groups of people that we agree on our goals. We disagree on means.
[02:12:24.260 --> 02:12:35.260]  We're both trying to get to the same place, but we may argue about how to get there. It's clear to me now that we have in the Democratic Party a gang, the Hillary gang, and preceded by the Obama gang.
[02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:45.260]  And these people are gangsters, and they operate in a gangsterish way, and they want to deploy the organs of government against their critics and against the people who oppose them.
[02:12:45.260 --> 02:13:01.260]  And so far from cowering and hiding, I think we need to go sling blade on these guys, absolutely open up every front. The movie is a shift of career for me going from books, which have an important but have a limited reach to movies where you try to reach millions of people.
[02:13:01.260 --> 02:13:09.260]  This will make us a threat, but on the other hand, at the end of the day, we can reach more people, we can change more minds. The FBI won and died Hillary, but our movie does it.
[02:13:09.260 --> 02:13:21.260]  That's right. I can't wait to see it. I'm so angry. How do people go see it? Obviously, they go to the website. It's so critical up front to make it a huge hit so it gets put on thousands of screens and dominates.
[02:13:21.260 --> 02:13:26.260]  It's a secret of Hollywood that the fate of a movie depends a lot on the opening weekend.
[02:13:26.260 --> 02:13:40.260]  That if it does well, it blows out to more theaters. And so our website is Hillary'sAmericaTheMovie.com. Hillary'sAmericaTheMovie.com. And you can watch a trailer and you can put in your zip code and it's going to tell you where you can see the movie near you.
[02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:47.260]  So do that. Please try to see it this weekend. Some people say, I'll wait a month. I'll see it in DVD. No. If you want to put fuel in a...
[02:13:47.260 --> 02:13:54.260]  Go deal with the crowds. You want the crowds. This is stomping on Hillary. When you're crushing in there and you're not someone sitting next to you, that means we're winning.
[02:13:54.260 --> 02:14:03.260]  The film, we premiered it here at the RNC. We had 2,000 people, delegates. People went nuts. I mean, you had people crying, people applauding wildly.
[02:14:03.260 --> 02:14:15.260]  I think people got the sense that this is a film that delivers the punch that we often don't deliver. You know, too often Republicans go in the fetal position, they take a beating from the Democrats.
[02:14:15.260 --> 02:14:24.260]  And they just rely on other people to do our work. Oh, we're waiting for Fokomi to indict. So he'll do our work for us. No, he's not going to do our work for us. We have to do our work for us.
[02:14:24.260 --> 02:14:31.260]  That's right. Speaking of media being more important than ever in persecution, I knew about this a year ago, but I confirmed it a few weeks ago.
[02:14:31.260 --> 02:14:36.260]  And I've confirmed it with Roger Stone and others. And he's been a consultant at Fox, but I've talked to high-level folks at Fox.
[02:14:36.260 --> 02:14:49.260]  There is a coup there with this made-up sexual harassment stuff by some of these women that, you know, he hugged them or whatever, you know, six years ago or whatever, to bring down Fox and that the liberal Murdoch children are in a deal with Hillary.
[02:14:49.260 --> 02:14:57.260]  And I know from three different people, they're told, do not mention Bill Clinton and his stuff with women or your fire. Well, Hannity's still done it.
[02:14:57.260 --> 02:15:12.260]  Now 30 hosts are now up to 30 threatening to leave and go with Ailes. But aside from Fox, it shows the climate where the Clintons are running coups at Fox right now to try to stop, I guarantee, your film getting out, you know, a whole laundry list of stuff.
[02:15:12.260 --> 02:15:21.260]  This is crazy, folks. This shows that they're battling to try to maintain control of the country. We're just peacefully here trying to vote and get our nation back.
[02:15:21.260 --> 02:15:25.260]  They're trying to start civil wars and cop killing and everything else you can imagine. I mean, this is crazy.
[02:15:25.260 --> 02:15:31.260]  I think it's worse than Obama with these guys because with Obama, his end goal was ideological. Now Obama...
[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:32.260]  You're slower America.
[02:15:32.260 --> 02:15:43.260]  Yeah. But Obama's willing to be gangsterish in the way he gets about it. So he's willing to, you know, he'll ignore the immigration laws or he'll selectively enforce the Obamacare.
[02:15:43.260 --> 02:15:45.260]  He'll turn the IRS loose on 10,000 churches.
[02:15:45.260 --> 02:15:50.260]  Yeah, or he'll ignore the regulations that say that welfare reform, you have to do this and this to qualify.
[02:15:50.260 --> 02:15:55.260]  But with Hillary, I think it's gangsterism through and through. I mean, I think that's who she is. That's her M.O.
[02:15:55.260 --> 02:16:02.260]  And if I had to say what she wants to be, she kind of wants to be the mob boss of America, the Al Capone of America.
[02:16:02.260 --> 02:16:07.260]  And Al Capone wanted to run Chicago like he owned the city, right? He had access to the city contracts.
[02:16:07.260 --> 02:16:10.260]  He told people what to do. You're against him. Snuff that guy out.
[02:16:10.260 --> 02:16:14.260]  And he wanted to go in the stadium and have the whole crowd shout, big Al, big Al, big Al.
[02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:23.260]  So this is what this woman, Hillary, wants. She has these sort of cultic ambitions for America unless the American people say differently.
[02:16:23.260 --> 02:16:27.260]  You're absolutely right. And it's coming down to a head.
[02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:34.260]  This film, describe the film. Let's go through this because the idea for the film, I mean, let's walk through why this film's so special.
[02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:40.260]  Well, when we started out the film, we actually had an immediate problem and that is that in 2012, Obama was an interesting guy.
[02:16:40.260 --> 02:16:45.260]  People were like fascinated by him. Who the heck is this fellow? He came out of nowhere, not a lot is known about him.
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:49.260]  What motivates him? Where's he coming from? So you could make a movie about Obama.
[02:16:49.260 --> 02:16:55.260]  I don't believe you can make an interesting movie just about Hillary because if I were to put, I mean, Hillary's been around.
[02:16:55.260 --> 02:17:00.260]  We know who she is. We know she's a crook. We know she's a pathological liar.
[02:17:00.260 --> 02:17:05.260]  So if you made a movie and put Hillary's face on there for 90 minutes, I believe that my audience would want to blow its brains out.
[02:17:05.260 --> 02:17:06.260]  I agree. I can't look at her.
[02:17:06.260 --> 02:17:10.260]  Yeah, you can't. You can't stand it. So you have to make a different kind of movie.
[02:17:10.260 --> 02:17:15.260]  And so we sat back and said, look, the way to make this movie is to see Hillary as part of a movement. She's part of a gang.
[02:17:15.260 --> 02:17:19.260]  Her gang is the progressive gang. It's the Democratic gang.
[02:17:19.260 --> 02:17:23.260]  Now, interestingly, this gang has been up to really bad stuff for a long time.
[02:17:23.260 --> 02:17:26.260]  A lot of Republicans don't know this. Even Reagan didn't know it.
[02:17:26.260 --> 02:17:30.260]  Reagan would go, I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party left me.
[02:17:30.260 --> 02:17:37.260]  You got the idea that Democrats are really good guys until like 15 minutes ago. And then with the McGovern campaign or something, they went off the rails.
[02:17:37.260 --> 02:17:39.260]  Well, they've always been nasty.
[02:17:39.260 --> 02:17:47.260]  When you dig into it, going all the way back to the days of slavery and segregation, eugenics in the early 20th century, forcibly sterilizing people.
[02:17:47.260 --> 02:17:51.260]  They quarter back every damn nightmare there is, and the Republicans have been really good.
[02:17:51.260 --> 02:17:58.260]  And the genius of the Democrats, having done that, they then figured out, let's take all of what we did and blame it on the South.
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:04.260]  Let's take all of what we did and blame it on America. Let's even blame it on the Republicans who tried to stop us from doing it.
[02:18:04.260 --> 02:18:08.260]  And then they got Hollywood on the game bashing the South. It's just a sick, dividing America.
[02:18:08.260 --> 02:18:14.260]  If you have the media, if you have Hollywood, and if you have academia, you have the three biggest megaphones in the country.
[02:18:14.260 --> 02:18:18.260]  It's very hard for anyone to contradict you when you control all three.
[02:18:18.260 --> 02:18:24.260]  And so that's why these people have been getting away with it. And they've been conning young people and fooling African Americans.
[02:18:24.260 --> 02:18:25.260]  So our movie in that sense is...
[02:18:25.260 --> 02:18:30.260]  All Hillary's behind the scenes saying, yeah, we got to make them heel-like dogs, you know, they're predators.
[02:18:30.260 --> 02:18:37.260]  While they're putting all the black males in jail for no reason to turn them into predators in a college of crime, which they full well know.
[02:18:37.260 --> 02:18:43.260]  And then they go give speeches about the colleges of crime when they're the ones that wrote the GI Bill to put everybody in prison.
[02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:50.260]  So we've been having all this urban unrest. And in the film, we have this theme, we call it the urban plantation.
[02:18:50.260 --> 02:18:55.260]  So the old plantations were rural, right? And if you think about the old plantations, what do you have?
[02:18:55.260 --> 02:19:01.260]  You had ramshackle dwellings, you had the family structure all broken up, illegitimacy widespread.
[02:19:01.260 --> 02:19:05.260]  You had everybody got a meager living, you got sick, they call the doctor.
[02:19:05.260 --> 02:19:10.260]  But on the other hand, no opportunity, no one gets ahead, hopelessness, despair, nihilism.
[02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:18.260]  Well, hey, fast forward 150 years, if you and I were to walk in inner city Oakland, Troy, Chicago, St. Louis, what do we see?
[02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:24.260]  Ramshackle dwellings, family structure all broken down. Everybody gets a meager living here, some food stamps.
[02:19:24.260 --> 02:19:30.260]  But on the other hand, no opportunity, no one gets properly educated, no hope, no ladder to climb up.
[02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:38.260]  So it's chilling to see the way the Democrats who ran the old plantations have created new plantations to do pretty much the same thing.
[02:19:38.260 --> 02:19:42.260]  And you have absolutely documented it in the new film. I mean, my crew wrote notes for me.
[02:19:42.260 --> 02:19:50.260]  Of the film, I have like eight pages of them. I've got one of the pages here. And so I've actually kind of not seen the film, but I've heard about, I'm salivating.
[02:19:50.260 --> 02:19:54.260]  And you need to go and I'm not just salivating to see this great filmmaker's work, writer.
[02:19:54.260 --> 02:20:00.260]  I know this is a weapon of truth that this dragon needs to have thrust into her politically. And I wish you any physical harm.
[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:04.260]  This is Dan Pilla. Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay? Are tax debts crippling you?

[02:21:34.260 --> 02:21:37.260]  Are we all going to sit on clouds and play harps?

[02:22:53.260 --> 02:22:55.260]  Go to gridwars.com.

[02:23:58.260 --> 02:24:03.260]  How do you handle Fox News?
[02:24:03.260 --> 02:24:06.260]  Oh, you just go in and take it over.
[02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:30.260]  Turn it into the CNN light.
[02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:32.260]  That's what's happening.
[02:24:32.260 --> 02:24:34.260]  This country is on the knife's edge.
[02:24:34.260 --> 02:24:39.260]  They're activating communists and radical groups that attacked me yesterday.
[02:24:39.260 --> 02:24:42.260]  They are running around calling for more cops to be killed.
[02:24:42.260 --> 02:24:43.260]  They want a civil war.
[02:24:43.260 --> 02:24:48.260]  I've never seen a more naked exercise of open tyranny in my lifetime.
[02:24:48.260 --> 02:24:50.260]  And I look back on American history.
[02:24:50.260 --> 02:24:52.260]  There's not a lot of examples of this.
[02:24:52.260 --> 02:24:56.260]  The filmmaker here in studio with us, Hillary's America.
[02:24:56.260 --> 02:24:58.260]  Everybody needs to go to the website.
[02:24:58.260 --> 02:25:00.260]  We're going to put it on screen for TV viewers.
[02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:01.260]  You need to go there.
[02:25:01.260 --> 02:25:05.260]  You need to go see the film because when you go the first opening week,
[02:25:05.260 --> 02:25:08.260]  I'd say it's like the equivalent of getting thousands of people to go later.
[02:25:08.260 --> 02:25:12.260]  I mean, you're going to reach thousands of people by putting it in theaters
[02:25:12.260 --> 02:25:15.260]  where folks go into the theater, just see it up there and have an opportunity to go,
[02:25:15.260 --> 02:25:17.260]  hey, I want to see that.
[02:25:17.260 --> 02:25:20.260]  That's why his film was the second biggest documentary in history.
[02:25:20.260 --> 02:25:23.260]  This is a short segment, a long segment, come up or take some calls to Nash.
[02:25:23.260 --> 02:25:33.260]  What scares me is I don't need to have any exaggeration or hyperbole to make this show interesting.
[02:25:33.260 --> 02:25:35.260]  I am so freaked out by the climate.
[02:25:35.260 --> 02:25:38.260]  I can't believe there's a coup going on at Fox.
[02:25:38.260 --> 02:25:40.260]  There's all these attacks on free speech.
[02:25:40.260 --> 02:25:43.260]  The president when cops get killed says we need to reform the police.
[02:25:43.260 --> 02:25:46.260]  Hillary says white folks better listen up.
[02:25:46.260 --> 02:25:48.260]  What the hell?
[02:25:48.260 --> 02:25:50.260]  How do we get an elite like this?
[02:25:50.260 --> 02:25:51.260]  They run the country.
[02:25:51.260 --> 02:25:54.260]  Why do they want to cause a civil war and run in the ground?
[02:25:54.260 --> 02:25:56.260]  Why do they want to burn everything down?
[02:25:56.260 --> 02:25:57.260]  What is their problem?
[02:25:57.260 --> 02:25:59.260]  What makes them tick?
[02:25:59.260 --> 02:26:06.260]  Well, I think with the Clintons, what makes them tick is an insatiable appetite for money and power.
[02:26:06.260 --> 02:26:08.260]  Now, Bill is different than Hillary.
[02:26:08.260 --> 02:26:10.260]  Bill's appetites are smaller.
[02:26:10.260 --> 02:26:12.260]  In other words, with Bill, you put him in a big room.
[02:26:12.260 --> 02:26:13.260]  You give him the biggest meal.
[02:26:13.260 --> 02:26:15.260]  You tell him he's the greatest guy.
[02:26:15.260 --> 02:26:17.260]  You put a long line of women outside and Bill's happy.
[02:26:17.260 --> 02:26:19.260]  That would be true.
[02:26:19.260 --> 02:26:21.260]  That's like the circumference of his appetites.
[02:26:21.260 --> 02:26:27.260]  But Hillary has a kind of a tyrannical streak in which she wants to know what you and I are having for dinner.
[02:26:27.260 --> 02:26:32.260]  She's not happy if she's not running things, telling people what to do, telling corporations what to do.
[02:26:32.260 --> 02:26:33.260]  That guy's against me.
[02:26:33.260 --> 02:26:34.260]  Okay, let's get rid of him.
[02:26:34.260 --> 02:26:36.260]  Let's move him off stage.
[02:26:36.260 --> 02:26:39.260]  This is a different kettle of fish.
[02:26:39.260 --> 02:26:44.260]  She has her people call a major comedy club in LA and actually the campaign threatened them.
[02:26:44.260 --> 02:26:47.260]  You will not let people make fun of me anymore.
[02:26:47.260 --> 02:26:52.260]  Yeah, it's a very, I mean, if you follow her life from a young age, this is a very twisted individual.
[02:26:52.260 --> 02:26:55.260]  Sounds like a nightmare to want to know what everybody's doing.
[02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:57.260]  Well, what's her problem?
[02:26:57.260 --> 02:26:58.260]  Just look at the way she's handled.
[02:26:58.260 --> 02:26:59.260]  Look at the way she's handled Bill.
[02:26:59.260 --> 02:27:04.260]  I think Hillary comes at a young age and she sees Bill and she sees this attractive guy.
[02:27:04.260 --> 02:27:08.260]  And she sees these very gregarious and he has this kind of political magnetism.
[02:27:08.260 --> 02:27:11.260]  And she goes, he has it. I don't have it.
[02:27:11.260 --> 02:27:14.260]  So if I want to get somewhere, I actually need him.
[02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:19.260]  So this is a problem because even if I get him 15 minutes later, he's going to go off with somebody else.
[02:27:19.260 --> 02:27:22.260]  So how do I prevent that permanently, permanently?
[02:27:22.260 --> 02:27:26.260]  I need to find out what his weaknesses and what's his weakness.
[02:27:26.260 --> 02:27:30.260]  Well, he's kind of a sex addict and he can cross the line and do whatever he wants with women.
[02:27:30.260 --> 02:27:32.260]  And that's probably going to get him locked up.
[02:27:32.260 --> 02:27:34.260]  And he probably knows that.
[02:27:34.260 --> 02:27:39.260]  So I'll go to him and I'll figure out a thing and I'll basically say, Bill, listen, you need me because I'm your fixer.
[02:27:39.260 --> 02:27:40.260]  I'll cover it up for you.
[02:27:40.260 --> 02:27:41.260]  I'm your cover person.
[02:27:41.260 --> 02:27:43.260]  Yeah. And so that's what she does.
[02:27:43.260 --> 02:27:48.260]  She's not the, the sort of betrayed housewife who's like, if we feel sorry for poor Hillary,
[02:27:48.260 --> 02:27:52.260]  she's had this horrible husband. No, she's been his enabler since day one.
[02:27:52.260 --> 02:27:54.260]  She's known about this from the very beginning.
[02:27:54.260 --> 02:27:56.260]  She's already been president for eight years.
[02:27:56.260 --> 02:27:59.260]  Yeah. So this gives you just a little window into the character,
[02:27:59.260 --> 02:28:02.260]  the kind of person who would, who would frame their life this way.
[02:28:02.260 --> 02:28:04.260]  An archetypal villain.
[02:28:04.260 --> 02:28:09.260]  And somebody who would be so power hungry that you'd be settling for a lot of,
[02:28:09.260 --> 02:28:14.260]  for the most kind of sick personal arrangements in order to kind of get what you want.
[02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:18.260]  The Russians admit they're scared up and they never talk.
[02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:20.260]  Yeah. That's very interesting.
[02:28:20.260 --> 02:28:23.260]  And I guess if I were Putin, I would be too.
[02:28:23.260 --> 02:28:25.260]  I mean, because she's dangerous.
[02:28:25.260 --> 02:28:29.260]  She might, I mean, like you said, she's very vindictive, but beat Bill up.
[02:28:29.260 --> 02:28:30.260]  That's come out secret service.
[02:28:30.260 --> 02:28:32.260]  I mean, this is a monster.
[02:28:32.260 --> 02:28:35.260]  We, we don't have the full handle on her.
[02:28:35.260 --> 02:28:40.260]  In this film, we try to trace episodes of her life.
[02:28:40.260 --> 02:28:46.260]  We focus on one incident very telling in the film where she is assigned to defend a guy who is,
[02:28:46.260 --> 02:28:49.260]  who raped a 12 year old kid, right?
[02:28:49.260 --> 02:28:51.260]  And what does Hillary do?
[02:28:51.260 --> 02:28:52.260]  She blames the victim.
[02:28:52.260 --> 02:28:55.260]  She goes after the 12 year old because of 12 years fantasizing.
[02:28:55.260 --> 02:29:02.260]  The 12 year old is young people are known to make stuff up and the prosecution has lethal evidence.
[02:29:02.260 --> 02:29:05.260]  And then they have incriminating evidence.
[02:29:05.260 --> 02:29:08.260]  And what Hillary does is she goes after that evidence discredits it.
[02:29:08.260 --> 02:29:09.260]  And then this is the key.
[02:29:09.260 --> 02:29:10.260]  Laughs about it.
[02:29:10.260 --> 02:29:12.260]  Now, there was one thing to say, look, the guy needs a defense.
[02:29:12.260 --> 02:29:13.260]  Everyone needs a lawyer.
[02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:15.260]  She got off on the evil being protected.
[02:29:15.260 --> 02:29:16.260]  She got.
[02:29:16.260 --> 02:29:18.260]  She didn't get a stomach ache because that's my job.
[02:29:18.260 --> 02:29:19.260]  She enjoyed it.
[02:29:19.260 --> 02:29:21.260]  Yeah. And we, and the good thing is we don't just say this.
[02:29:21.260 --> 02:29:22.260]  We don't make accusations of this movie.
[02:29:22.260 --> 02:29:24.260]  We play audio tape.
[02:29:24.260 --> 02:29:25.260]  So you listen to Hillary.
[02:29:25.260 --> 02:29:26.260]  Let's come back and talk about this.
[02:29:26.260 --> 02:29:27.260]  This, this story is important.
[02:29:27.260 --> 02:29:28.260]  This hasn't gotten out there.
[02:29:28.260 --> 02:29:31.260]  This is one of the things I've been told is banned on Fox.
[02:29:31.260 --> 02:29:33.260]  And all of it is, is the right stuff.
[02:29:33.260 --> 02:29:36.260]  And this story about her, uh, you know, helping this rapist get off.
[02:29:36.260 --> 02:29:37.260]  So this is really important.
[02:29:37.260 --> 02:29:40.260]  As soon as she's here with us, they do not want you to be hearing this.
[02:29:40.260 --> 02:29:41.260]  Make no mistake.
[02:29:41.260 --> 02:29:43.260]  They don't want the aircraft, the police, the prison flying around.
[02:29:43.260 --> 02:29:44.260]  They got those banned.
[02:29:44.260 --> 02:29:45.260]  They want to shut us up.
[02:29:45.260 --> 02:29:46.260]  We're not shutting up.
[02:29:46.260 --> 02:29:49.260]  Stay with us.
[02:29:49.260 --> 02:29:50.260]  We're on the March.
[02:29:50.260 --> 02:29:52.260]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:52.260 --> 02:30:00.260]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:00.260 --> 02:30:01.260]  All right.
[02:30:01.260 --> 02:30:02.260]  Time to get serious.
[02:30:02.260 --> 02:30:07.260]  There's a new HIV vaccine to be trialed in South Africa later this year.
[02:30:07.260 --> 02:30:11.260]  Alback dash HIV slash GP 120 is the official name of the vaccine.
[02:30:11.260 --> 02:30:16.260]  And it was tested on a small scale in a 50 person experiment to measure immune response.
[02:30:16.260 --> 02:30:21.260]  Linda Gail Becker, director of the Desmond Tutu HIV center in Cape Town and leading
[02:30:21.260 --> 02:30:25.260]  the vaccine trials claims that the small scale test was quote to see if the vaccine looks
[02:30:25.260 --> 02:30:26.260]  promising.
[02:30:26.260 --> 02:30:32.260]  The vaccine stems from a 2009 trial in Thailand, which resulted in 60% protection against HIV
[02:30:32.260 --> 02:30:36.260]  the first year, but afterward falling to 30% before the trials end.
[02:30:36.260 --> 02:30:41.260]  Gail Becker, in addition to Anthony Fauci also working on the trial, intend to add adjuvants
[02:30:41.260 --> 02:30:43.260]  to strengthen the vaccine's potency.
[02:30:43.260 --> 02:30:45.260]  Oh yeah, like that's going to go over well.
[02:30:45.260 --> 02:30:49.260]  And wait people know what mass vaccine trials could possibly mean.
[02:30:49.260 --> 02:30:52.260]  Prepare the genocide preparations.
[02:30:52.260 --> 02:30:57.260]  Article on CNN.com, this is Gabe Goldiman for info wars.com.
[02:31:23.260 --> 02:31:26.260]  There are silent weapons for quiet war.
[02:31:26.260 --> 02:31:31.260]  Pathogens added to the food and water into the lining of plastics that destroy our
[02:31:31.260 --> 02:31:36.260]  vitality, turn off our hormones and accelerate our journey towards death.
[02:31:36.260 --> 02:31:39.260]  I personally counter this onslaught with Anthroplex.
[02:31:39.260 --> 02:31:46.260]  Anthroplex is designed with known organic concentrated herbs to create the basic
[02:31:46.260 --> 02:31:50.260]  foundation to normal metabolic activity inside the human body.

[02:31:58.260 --> 02:32:00.260]  with Anthroplex.

[02:32:30.260 --> 02:32:35.260]  But I am most proud of the product we're now launching today with its unique delivery
[02:32:35.260 --> 02:32:40.260]  system and proprietary manufacturing process designed for maximized effects.
[02:32:40.260 --> 02:32:44.260]  This formula is the platinum standard of multivitamin mineral products.

[02:32:57.260 --> 02:32:59.260]  Take action now before we sell out.
[02:32:59.260 --> 02:33:12.260]  Music
[02:33:12.260 --> 02:33:19.260]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:19.260 --> 02:33:23.260]  Music
[02:33:23.260 --> 02:33:31.260]  By the way, that liner, I've had that liner for about 15, 16 years and it was kind of tongue in cheek.
[02:33:31.260 --> 02:33:35.260]  We take you now to the Central Texas Command Center deep behind enemy lines.
[02:33:35.260 --> 02:33:38.260]  I'm now at a point where Matt Brudge comes to me last year and says,
[02:33:38.260 --> 02:33:41.260]  I met with the Supreme Court Justice, giving all the details.
[02:33:41.260 --> 02:33:43.260]  They've come to them and said, get ready, we're getting ready for free speech,
[02:33:43.260 --> 02:33:44.260]  whether the Supreme Court likes it or not.
[02:33:44.260 --> 02:33:46.260]  We're going to shut down talk radio.
[02:33:46.260 --> 02:33:49.260]  We're going to install Hillary, it's all going to happen, get ready.
[02:33:49.260 --> 02:33:53.260]  And then now here we are like nine, 10 months later, it's happening. There's a coup at Fox.
[02:33:53.260 --> 02:33:56.260]  That means they're coming for us next.
[02:33:56.260 --> 02:34:03.260]  And that is such a surreal feeling to be sitting next to a political prisoner who was thrown in prison for nine months,
[02:34:03.260 --> 02:34:13.260]  literally because they didn't fill out a piece of paperwork when he got four or five of his friends to donate money to a campaign running against Hillary's old Senate seat.
[02:34:13.260 --> 02:34:21.260]  I mean, she's taking money from third world dictators, $100 million from Gulf states that throw gays off buildings and women can't drive cars,
[02:34:21.260 --> 02:34:23.260]  and they're like chained up like dogs.
[02:34:23.260 --> 02:34:27.260]  And she's saying that, oh, that Trump's a shoving his pig over here.
[02:34:27.260 --> 02:34:30.260]  I mean, this is the inversion of reality.
[02:34:30.260 --> 02:34:32.260]  We're going back to Dinesh and Sousa here in a moment.
[02:34:32.260 --> 02:34:35.260]  We're going to open the phones up too for a few questions if you have them for Dinesh and Sousa.
[02:34:35.260 --> 02:34:40.260]  800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[02:34:40.260 --> 02:34:46.260]  But before I go any further, and that's first time callers today, by the way, 800-259-9231,
[02:34:46.260 --> 02:34:51.260]  InfoWars is a platform, the globalists know this, to promote America.
[02:34:51.260 --> 02:34:53.260]  And I skip network breaks.
[02:34:53.260 --> 02:34:55.260]  I don't plug every segment like other hosts.
[02:34:55.260 --> 02:35:00.260]  I haven't hardly plugged a day except for 30 seconds because I'm so on fire fighting tyrants.
[02:35:00.260 --> 02:35:02.260]  Bottom line, you fund my operation.
[02:35:02.260 --> 02:35:07.260]  I will take it to the enemy, and I've shown all of that, and I will put, this year I'm putting everything in.
[02:35:07.260 --> 02:35:11.260]  Okay, I am all, our reserves, everything, okay?
[02:35:11.260 --> 02:35:13.260]  Because I know there's no future.
[02:35:13.260 --> 02:35:14.260]  This is a critical time.
[02:35:14.260 --> 02:35:17.260]  I'm not going to take the field against this enemy and not go 110%.
[02:35:17.260 --> 02:35:21.260]  We have the best vitamins and minerals and supplements that anybody's got.
[02:35:21.260 --> 02:35:28.260]  That's why third party sides give us five stars, just because I went out and hired the top three companies in the country to make our proprietary products.
[02:35:28.260 --> 02:35:30.260]  Some of them are private labeled as well.
[02:35:30.260 --> 02:35:34.260]  I mean, our colloidal silver, instead of $25, it's $19.
[02:35:34.260 --> 02:35:39.260]  It's the same stuff they sell the whole foods. It's the highest quality safest here, according to the government and the rest of it.
[02:35:39.260 --> 02:35:40.260]  That's an example.
[02:35:40.260 --> 02:35:43.260]  This is a topical deal, you know, antibiotic when their stuff doesn't work.
[02:35:43.260 --> 02:35:44.260]  That's an example.
[02:35:44.260 --> 02:35:55.260]  But DNA force, that sales ending, whether it's Hillary for prison shirt, books, films, thousands of great items, solar power generators for your house, high quality, storeable foods, all of it.
[02:35:55.260 --> 02:36:04.260]  Thousands of items that are available at infostore.com are by calling toll free 888-253-3139.
[02:36:04.260 --> 02:36:23.260]  And it's this broadcast that funds not just my operation, but helps boost so many other operations against the globalist and against tyrants and leftist and all these other criminal institutions like the nefarious activities of George Soros.
[02:36:23.260 --> 02:36:26.260]  So I'm kind of distracted with a helicopter flying outside the window.
[02:36:26.260 --> 02:36:36.260]  But it's very, very important that folks realize that when somebody like Roger Stone or myself are out of energy, I take a brain force and it's natural compounds.
[02:36:36.260 --> 02:36:43.260]  Some of them are prescription in Europe that are known to safely boost your energy, but clear thinking, not a bunch of caffeine.
[02:36:43.260 --> 02:36:44.260]  There is some green tea in it.
[02:36:44.260 --> 02:36:53.260]  Brain force available at infostore.com as well or infowarslife.com takes you directly to the nutraceuticals.
[02:36:53.260 --> 02:36:56.260]  Maybe Buckley, we should probably aim at that helicopter for folks out there if we can.
[02:36:56.260 --> 02:37:01.260]  We've got a limited crew here because we actually have the folks that run in force.
[02:37:01.260 --> 02:37:09.260]  Normally in the back room, we're actually running the cameras today because we've got everybody deployed out with the communist burning flags and black lives matter.
[02:37:09.260 --> 02:37:14.260]  People running around calling for violence and interviewing Nigel Farage and so much more.
[02:37:14.260 --> 02:37:16.260]  And all that's going to be on the nightly news tonight.
[02:37:16.260 --> 02:37:21.260]  7 o'clock central infowars.com forward slash show for details and affiliates and more.
[02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:22.260]  So be sure and check that out.
[02:37:22.260 --> 02:37:24.260]  But just know I think everybody knows this.
[02:37:24.260 --> 02:37:25.260]  I want to thank the listeners.
[02:37:25.260 --> 02:37:33.260]  You're just as important as I am or any of the crew at info wars when you buy the products, when you support us.
[02:37:33.260 --> 02:37:35.260]  So again, we're going to go ahead and punch that up.
[02:37:35.260 --> 02:37:36.260]  You can see the helicopter out there.
[02:37:36.260 --> 02:37:39.260]  It's a little bit blown out of the helicopter right outside the window.
[02:37:39.260 --> 02:37:42.260]  And obviously something interesting is going on.
[02:37:42.260 --> 02:37:47.260]  We're right above the Quicken Loans Center, about 300 yards away, right here at the entrance.
[02:37:47.260 --> 02:37:50.260]  We also have passes to be anywhere we want to inside.
[02:37:50.260 --> 02:37:53.260]  We've got our crew in there, but so much more is happening outside.
[02:37:53.260 --> 02:37:55.260]  I will be in there doing a lot of feeds tonight.
[02:37:55.260 --> 02:37:59.260]  So look for all of that infowars.com and prisonplanted.com.
[02:37:59.260 --> 02:38:00.260]  But here's the bottom line.
[02:38:00.260 --> 02:38:10.260]  I'm almost mad at myself, calmly sitting here right now, just talking about coups at Fox News
[02:38:10.260 --> 02:38:13.260]  and attempts to shut down free speech and government in different documents
[02:38:13.260 --> 02:38:15.260]  and in public schools banning the words mother and father.
[02:38:15.260 --> 02:38:19.260]  I mean, I mean, sometimes I think it's like I woke up in a nightmare Alice in Wonderland.
[02:38:19.260 --> 02:38:22.260]  But just thank you for the support and be sure to shop with the good guys
[02:38:22.260 --> 02:38:25.260]  so that we can fund our operation and be truly independent.
[02:38:25.260 --> 02:38:27.260]  infowarsstore.com, infowarslife.com.
[02:38:27.260 --> 02:38:31.260]  Now, I'm going back to Dinesh, who's with us at the end of the hour.
[02:38:31.260 --> 02:38:32.260]  I'm going to take a few phone calls.
[02:38:32.260 --> 02:38:34.260]  Dinesh, you've got the floor here.
[02:38:34.260 --> 02:38:35.260]  Run with it.
[02:38:35.260 --> 02:38:37.260]  You've just been laying out so much truth here.
[02:38:37.260 --> 02:38:41.260]  Your new film, Hillary's America, it's critical that everyone go
[02:38:41.260 --> 02:38:44.260]  and that everyone see it as it opens this coming weekend.
[02:38:44.260 --> 02:38:48.260]  Your last film really crippled them, but this one's even more hardcore.
[02:38:48.260 --> 02:38:53.260]  This could be the political death blow of everything going on out there.
[02:38:53.260 --> 02:38:55.260]  Everything in the resistance.
[02:38:55.260 --> 02:39:00.260]  I see this is probably the undoubtedly the most powerful truth bomb
[02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:03.260]  in the information peaceful war we're in against these tyrants out there.
[02:39:03.260 --> 02:39:06.260]  How do we make sure it hits its target?
[02:39:06.260 --> 02:39:10.260]  Our website is hillarysamericathemovie.com
[02:39:10.260 --> 02:39:14.260]  and if you go there, you should watch the trailer, share it,
[02:39:14.260 --> 02:39:16.260]  and also put in your zip code.
[02:39:16.260 --> 02:39:19.260]  It'll tell you where the movie is playing near you.
[02:39:19.260 --> 02:39:22.260]  The reason the movie is powerful is it's a really good movie,
[02:39:22.260 --> 02:39:26.260]  but more importantly, it tells its story as a detective story.
[02:39:26.260 --> 02:39:28.260]  It's a narrative. It's a thriller.
[02:39:28.260 --> 02:39:32.260]  Now, since Hillary is the topic of it, we do veer into the horror genre.
[02:39:32.260 --> 02:39:34.260]  We can't couldn't avoid that.
[02:39:34.260 --> 02:39:36.260]  So there's a little bit of that in the movie too.
[02:39:36.260 --> 02:39:38.260]  But the point is this, people always come to me and say,
[02:39:38.260 --> 02:39:40.260]  Dinesh, make a movie about Obamacare.
[02:39:40.260 --> 02:39:42.260]  Dinesh, make a movie about immigration.
[02:39:42.260 --> 02:39:44.260]  But people don't go to movies to get messaging.
[02:39:44.260 --> 02:39:46.260]  They don't go to movies even to be educated.
[02:39:46.260 --> 02:39:48.260]  They go to movies to be entertained.
[02:39:48.260 --> 02:39:51.260]  And we know that, so we make actually a very entertaining movie
[02:39:51.260 --> 02:39:54.260]  that leaves you not only intellectually empowered,
[02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:57.260]  but emotionally moved and ready to act.
[02:39:57.260 --> 02:39:59.260]  And it is horror, so you've got to represent the break
[02:39:59.260 --> 02:40:02.260]  getting into her defending sexual prodigy.
[02:40:02.260 --> 02:40:04.260]  So let's talk about the story.
[02:40:04.260 --> 02:40:06.260]  You know what's so creepy about it is this is Hillary
[02:40:06.260 --> 02:40:09.260]  in a little younger age, and of course Hillary is such a chameleon
[02:40:09.260 --> 02:40:12.260]  that when she's narrating the story, it's her own voice.
[02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:15.260]  Remember, some of the most powerful passages in 2016
[02:40:15.260 --> 02:40:17.260]  were Obama talking in his own voice.
[02:40:17.260 --> 02:40:20.260]  And the reason we had his own voice is that he read his own book,
[02:40:20.260 --> 02:40:23.260]  Dreams of My Father, from My Father, in audiobooks.
[02:40:23.260 --> 02:40:25.260]  So we could play sections where Obama's telling the story.
[02:40:25.260 --> 02:40:26.260]  Well, who can disagree?
[02:40:26.260 --> 02:40:29.260]  This is Obama talking about his own mind and his own life.
[02:40:29.260 --> 02:40:31.260]  And here we have Hillary in her own voice.
[02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:33.260]  Now, she's got the fake southern accent,
[02:40:33.260 --> 02:40:35.260]  and she's kind of putting on, well,
[02:40:35.260 --> 02:40:38.260]  and she's telling the story about this guy who did a rape.
[02:40:38.260 --> 02:40:43.260]  Except when you listen to her tone, it is so frigid, cold.
[02:40:43.260 --> 02:40:45.260]  And then she talks about, she's,
[02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:48.260]  I got this guy to take a lie detector test, a polygraph test,
[02:40:48.260 --> 02:40:50.260]  which he passed, and then she adds,
[02:40:50.260 --> 02:40:53.260]  which forever destroyed my faith in polygraphs.
[02:40:53.260 --> 02:40:56.260]  And then she laughs, you know, her famous cackle.
[02:40:56.260 --> 02:40:59.260]  And you actually begin to hear, in a way,
[02:40:59.260 --> 02:41:01.260]  this is the first time you say,
[02:41:01.260 --> 02:41:03.260]  well, that's actually the voice of evil.
[02:41:03.260 --> 02:41:08.260]  That's actually someone who is happy that this guy beat the rape thing
[02:41:08.260 --> 02:41:11.260]  and that she got him off, and she thinks it's actually funny
[02:41:11.260 --> 02:41:15.260]  that the guy who did it was able to lie and get out of it.
[02:41:15.260 --> 02:41:19.260]  And for me, it's knowing about how psychopaths and sociopaths are.
[02:41:19.260 --> 02:41:22.260]  They have this real self, but everything else is like fake to manipulate.
[02:41:22.260 --> 02:41:25.260]  When she goes to California and speaks to Latino groups,
[02:41:25.260 --> 02:41:27.260]  she puts on this fake Latino voice, when she goes to Kentucky,
[02:41:27.260 --> 02:41:29.260]  she goes, how you doing there, boy?
[02:41:29.260 --> 02:41:33.260]  Like she's, you know, grandma clamping, getting some possum grits for you.
[02:41:33.260 --> 02:41:36.260]  I mean, it's like, I wouldn't hang around with anybody
[02:41:36.260 --> 02:41:38.260]  that when they got around different groups, talked a different way.
[02:41:38.260 --> 02:41:42.260]  I mean, it is bizarre to show that that's what psychopaths do.
[02:41:42.260 --> 02:41:43.260]  And I think she's a psychopath.
[02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:45.260]  I think she's a full-blown psychopath.
[02:41:45.260 --> 02:41:49.260]  Is that they do feel this need to just put on these fake acts.
[02:41:49.260 --> 02:41:51.260]  It's very creepy. What do you think?
[02:41:51.260 --> 02:41:52.260]  I think so.
[02:41:52.260 --> 02:41:55.260]  And I think she might even have gotten some of this from Bill,
[02:41:55.260 --> 02:41:56.260]  because Bill is the master of it.
[02:41:56.260 --> 02:41:59.260]  And we have actually, you know, people have heard,
[02:41:59.260 --> 02:42:01.260]  I did not have sex with that woman,
[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:04.260]  but what they actually haven't heard is if you go back and play the old tapes
[02:42:04.260 --> 02:42:08.260]  where Bill was and Hillary were both confronted with all this stuff
[02:42:08.260 --> 02:42:13.260]  and the kind of silky nonsense that they put out at one point,
[02:42:13.260 --> 02:42:15.260]  I think it was Steve Croft says to the Clintons,
[02:42:15.260 --> 02:42:18.260]  well, you know, I think Americans can kind of accept that you guys,
[02:42:18.260 --> 02:42:20.260]  whatever your problems, you've worked it out,
[02:42:20.260 --> 02:42:22.260]  you've made some kind of arrangement.
[02:42:22.260 --> 02:42:23.260]  And then Bill jumps in and he goes,
[02:42:23.260 --> 02:42:26.260]  arrangement, we don't have an arrangement.
[02:42:26.260 --> 02:42:29.260]  We love each other. We have, this is, we have a marriage.
[02:42:29.260 --> 02:42:30.260]  Yeah.
[02:42:30.260 --> 02:42:31.260]  It's totally different.
[02:42:31.260 --> 02:42:33.260]  Yeah, she's not, you know, banging three-sixes a day like me too.
[02:42:33.260 --> 02:42:34.260]  I mean, you know.
[02:42:34.260 --> 02:42:36.260]  I mean, so I think what you do is, you know,
[02:42:36.260 --> 02:42:38.260]  you try to do with these movies, at the end of the day,
[02:42:38.260 --> 02:42:40.260]  it's about peering into their soul.
[02:42:40.260 --> 02:42:42.260]  And with the Obama movie, I tried to get Obama.
[02:42:42.260 --> 02:42:45.260]  At the end of the day, it's not just about his policies.
[02:42:45.260 --> 02:42:46.260]  He's got to bring America down.
[02:42:46.260 --> 02:42:48.260]  Yeah, I mean, yesterday Christie stood up
[02:42:48.260 --> 02:42:50.260]  and recited the indictment against Hillary.
[02:42:50.260 --> 02:42:52.260]  Boom, point one, point two, point three.
[02:42:52.260 --> 02:42:53.260]  And this is the Republican thing.
[02:42:53.260 --> 02:42:55.260]  You make a kind of legal indictment,
[02:42:55.260 --> 02:42:58.260]  but it's even more powerful if you can pull people into a narrative
[02:42:58.260 --> 02:43:01.260]  where they can understand Hillary as a person.
[02:43:01.260 --> 02:43:04.260]  They kind of get her and then they realize what we're dealing with.
[02:43:04.260 --> 02:43:06.260]  I agree. Well, that's why Meg and Kelly don't get off on a jag.
[02:43:06.260 --> 02:43:07.260]  I've watched her.
[02:43:07.260 --> 02:43:09.260]  I see her on that sinister power trip.
[02:43:09.260 --> 02:43:11.260]  It's that Jezebelian energy.
[02:43:11.260 --> 02:43:14.260]  And, you know, Roger else who made her who she is to see her.
[02:43:14.260 --> 02:43:18.260]  So he hugged me once too hard and I want him taken out.
[02:43:18.260 --> 02:43:20.260]  And I know because I have the inside baseball.
[02:43:20.260 --> 02:43:21.260]  It is from the Clintons.
[02:43:21.260 --> 02:43:22.260]  There are talking points.
[02:43:22.260 --> 02:43:23.260]  People are being threatened.
[02:43:23.260 --> 02:43:24.260]  I've talked to those.
[02:43:24.260 --> 02:43:28.260]  And it's like, wow, she really is an agent of the Clintons.
[02:43:28.260 --> 02:43:31.260]  And all that stuff with Trump.
[02:43:31.260 --> 02:43:35.260]  And it's like seeing her join with evil.
[02:43:35.260 --> 02:43:38.260]  Now this is a thousand times worth with Hillary, obviously,
[02:43:38.260 --> 02:43:40.260]  but it's just, it's the creepiness.
[02:43:40.260 --> 02:43:42.260]  It's the dishonor of it.
[02:43:42.260 --> 02:43:45.260]  It's the sliminess that really tells you what we're dealing with
[02:43:45.260 --> 02:43:48.260]  is a bunch of evil people because I don't have the energy
[02:43:48.260 --> 02:43:51.260]  to run around and scheme when I run other people's lives.
[02:43:51.260 --> 02:43:52.260]  I don't have the energy.
[02:43:52.260 --> 02:43:53.260]  I study these evil people.
[02:43:53.260 --> 02:43:55.260]  They enjoy, like you said earlier,
[02:43:55.260 --> 02:43:57.260]  running other people's lives,
[02:43:57.260 --> 02:43:59.260]  knowing what you're doing, controlling you,
[02:43:59.260 --> 02:44:02.260]  ruining you just because they're quite frankly jealous of you.
[02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:04.260]  And they're jealous of America.
[02:44:04.260 --> 02:44:05.260]  They're jealous of free market.
[02:44:05.260 --> 02:44:08.260]  They're jealous of open free societies compared to everything else.
[02:44:08.260 --> 02:44:09.260]  They're saying we're perfect.
[02:44:09.260 --> 02:44:11.260]  And that's what you said in your first film, I think, is it's like,
[02:44:11.260 --> 02:44:13.260]  they want to mount our head on the wall.
[02:44:13.260 --> 02:44:15.260]  It's like, they want to say, you know,
[02:44:15.260 --> 02:44:17.260]  they basically kicked our butt, Dinesh.
[02:44:17.260 --> 02:44:19.260]  But you know what they have that, have they?
[02:44:19.260 --> 02:44:22.260]  Well, Hillary and Bill grew up in America
[02:44:22.260 --> 02:44:25.260]  where the most successful people are the creative people
[02:44:25.260 --> 02:44:27.260]  that come up with new stuff.
[02:44:27.260 --> 02:44:30.260]  Someone invents the iPhone and makes people's lives better.
[02:44:30.260 --> 02:44:32.260]  People happily drive in their car and give them money.
[02:44:32.260 --> 02:44:33.260]  They create scams.
[02:44:33.260 --> 02:44:35.260]  These guys realize we can't do that.
[02:44:35.260 --> 02:44:38.260]  But that doesn't mean we don't have other talents.
[02:44:38.260 --> 02:44:40.260]  Our talents are in stirring up resentment,
[02:44:40.260 --> 02:44:43.260]  mobilizing it against these wealth creators.
[02:44:43.260 --> 02:44:45.260]  And so there's this kind of secret war in our society
[02:44:45.260 --> 02:44:48.260]  between productive people who create wealth,
[02:44:48.260 --> 02:44:50.260]  not just the entrepreneurs, the workers, too, on the one hand,
[02:44:50.260 --> 02:44:51.260]  and on the other hand...
[02:44:51.260 --> 02:44:53.260]  Well, they want the workers for it.
[02:44:53.260 --> 02:44:55.260]  That's why they're bringing the population to drive down wages.
[02:44:55.260 --> 02:44:58.260]  And these guys, this kind of class of people,
[02:44:58.260 --> 02:45:01.260]  they're powerful in academia, in the media, in Hollywood,
[02:45:01.260 --> 02:45:03.260]  and these community organizers,
[02:45:03.260 --> 02:45:04.260]  and you've got an alliance of these guys.
[02:45:04.260 --> 02:45:05.260]  That's it.
[02:45:05.260 --> 02:45:07.260]  And I realize being around them more and more over these years,
[02:45:07.260 --> 02:45:09.260]  they actually know what they're doing.
[02:45:09.260 --> 02:45:11.260]  I always thought a lot of them were just idiots.
[02:45:11.260 --> 02:45:14.260]  They know that they're creeping around, manipulating everyone.
[02:45:14.260 --> 02:45:15.260]  They're good at what they do.
[02:45:15.260 --> 02:45:17.260]  I mean, Obama, look, you know, people say,
[02:45:17.260 --> 02:45:18.260]  Obama's an incompetent.
[02:45:18.260 --> 02:45:20.260]  We can't read from the teleprompter.
[02:45:20.260 --> 02:45:24.260]  The truth of it is Obama has moved America a lot closer to his goals.
[02:45:24.260 --> 02:45:25.260]  He has undone...
[02:45:25.260 --> 02:45:26.260]  He's almost destroyed it.
[02:45:26.260 --> 02:45:28.260]  He has weakened us.
[02:45:28.260 --> 02:45:29.260]  He has undermined our economy.
[02:45:29.260 --> 02:45:31.260]  He's doubled our national debt.
[02:45:31.260 --> 02:45:35.260]  There are places in the world where nothing could happen without America, say so.
[02:45:35.260 --> 02:45:38.260]  And today, America has almost no influence in the region.
[02:45:38.260 --> 02:45:39.260]  We have very little influence.
[02:45:39.260 --> 02:45:40.260]  People say, oh, good, we were arrogant.
[02:45:40.260 --> 02:45:42.260]  Yeah, but now it's the globalists running America
[02:45:42.260 --> 02:45:44.260]  who are all these shadowy groups you can't even...
[02:45:44.260 --> 02:45:46.260]  I mean, it's 10 times worse.
[02:45:46.260 --> 02:45:47.260]  It's worse.
[02:45:47.260 --> 02:45:48.260]  And the communist Chinese now are, like,
[02:45:48.260 --> 02:45:51.260]  dictating to Hollywood what they can put out.
[02:45:51.260 --> 02:45:53.260]  And in, like, Spiking Savage's book,
[02:45:53.260 --> 02:45:55.260]  we personally have run into the communist Chinese
[02:45:55.260 --> 02:45:57.260]  now trying to manipulate in the U.S. on us.
[02:45:57.260 --> 02:45:59.260]  I mean, they have got some tentacles, my friend.
[02:45:59.260 --> 02:46:00.260]  And people say, you know,
[02:46:00.260 --> 02:46:02.260]  what's Hillary's view of national security?
[02:46:02.260 --> 02:46:05.260]  You know, as if Hillary has a national security doctrine.
[02:46:05.260 --> 02:46:07.260]  Hillary has no national security doctrine.
[02:46:07.260 --> 02:46:10.260]  Hillary's national security doctrine is the following.
[02:46:10.260 --> 02:46:13.260]  The United States has a great big pile of wealth
[02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:14.260]  and a great big pile of power.
[02:46:14.260 --> 02:46:15.260]  And she can broker the sale of it.
[02:46:15.260 --> 02:46:18.260]  Yeah, let me just help myself to as much of it as I can
[02:46:18.260 --> 02:46:20.260]  and everything else is a distraction and a...
[02:46:20.260 --> 02:46:22.260]  She's presiding over the auction.
[02:46:22.260 --> 02:46:25.260]  She is exactly. And everything else is a nuisance.
[02:46:25.260 --> 02:46:26.260]  It's like a state sale.
[02:46:26.260 --> 02:46:28.260]  That's why she was like, what difference?
[02:46:28.260 --> 02:46:30.260]  Because the point is, to her, it's an annoyance.
[02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:31.260]  It's like, what?
[02:46:31.260 --> 02:46:33.260]  The 3AM phone call's coming in our way.
[02:46:33.260 --> 02:46:35.260]  And your history and your honor and beating the British.
[02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:37.260]  We don't want any of that. Just get rid of it.
[02:46:37.260 --> 02:46:39.260]  I mean, imagine a bunch of guys robbing Fort Knox.
[02:46:39.260 --> 02:46:41.260]  And people come running in and tell them,
[02:46:41.260 --> 02:46:42.260]  oh, someone's sick over there.
[02:46:42.260 --> 02:46:43.260]  Is there something?
[02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:45.260]  You know, they're going to be like, leave us alone.
[02:46:45.260 --> 02:46:47.260]  We're really busy robbing Fort Knox.
[02:46:47.260 --> 02:46:49.260]  We don't want to be distracted with any other nonsense.
[02:46:49.260 --> 02:46:51.260]  That's Hillary's attitude in...
[02:46:51.260 --> 02:46:52.260]  In Benghazi.
[02:46:52.260 --> 02:46:53.260]  In Benghazi.
[02:46:53.260 --> 02:46:54.260]  You're right. And that's it.
[02:46:54.260 --> 02:46:55.260]  And they...
[02:46:55.260 --> 02:46:58.260]  They're sociopaths, psychopaths, you know,
[02:46:58.260 --> 02:47:00.260]  different groups, variances of those.
[02:47:00.260 --> 02:47:02.260]  Literally, that's their disconnect.
[02:47:02.260 --> 02:47:03.260]  Why do they think they're going to win?
[02:47:03.260 --> 02:47:05.260]  They literally think in the end we're going to bow.
[02:47:05.260 --> 02:47:07.260]  They think in the end we're going to cower.
[02:47:07.260 --> 02:47:09.260]  They think in the end that we're just like them.
[02:47:09.260 --> 02:47:11.260]  No, that's not what's going to happen.
[02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:13.260]  As they get worse, we're going to get more hardcore.
[02:47:13.260 --> 02:47:15.260]  Now, there are ordinary Americans,
[02:47:15.260 --> 02:47:17.260]  rank-and-file Democrats, and they...
[02:47:17.260 --> 02:47:19.260]  They're suspicious of the Clintons.
[02:47:19.260 --> 02:47:20.260]  They know something's up here.
[02:47:20.260 --> 02:47:23.260]  But they think the Democratic Party is the party of the little guy.
[02:47:23.260 --> 02:47:26.260]  The Democratic Party's protected the outsider,
[02:47:26.260 --> 02:47:29.260]  the immigrant, the Latino, the black guy.
[02:47:29.260 --> 02:47:32.260]  So they think that Democrats have this moral capital
[02:47:32.260 --> 02:47:34.260]  that entitles them to rule...
[02:47:34.260 --> 02:47:36.260]  Your film explodes the myth.
[02:47:36.260 --> 02:47:37.260]  They're KKK.
[02:47:37.260 --> 02:47:40.260]  We take the meat axe to this whole propaganda.
[02:47:40.260 --> 02:47:42.260]  Listen, I grew up in the South.
[02:47:42.260 --> 02:47:45.260]  I never heard racist talk until I'd be around Democrats.
[02:47:45.260 --> 02:47:47.260]  And Democrats are the most...
[02:47:47.260 --> 02:47:50.260]  And even the, quote, minorities of Democrats are like race managers.
[02:47:50.260 --> 02:47:52.260]  They know their job.
[02:47:52.260 --> 02:47:56.260]  The racism in the South was itself fomented by the Democratic Party.
[02:47:56.260 --> 02:47:59.260]  If you wonder, does the South just actually genetically people are more racist?
[02:47:59.260 --> 02:48:00.260]  No.
[02:48:00.260 --> 02:48:03.260]  The Democratic Party set white supremacy as its goal
[02:48:03.260 --> 02:48:06.260]  and fomented racism in the South for a hundred years.
[02:48:06.260 --> 02:48:08.260]  On record to keep white farmers down.
[02:48:08.260 --> 02:48:10.260]  I mean, they wrote books admitting it.
[02:48:10.260 --> 02:48:11.260]  They did, you know.
[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:16.260]  Their goal was also political to establish the Democratic Party as the single party.
[02:48:16.260 --> 02:48:18.260]  The monolithic one-party system in the South.
[02:48:18.260 --> 02:48:20.260]  And they pretty much had it going for 50 years.
[02:48:20.260 --> 02:48:21.260]  Jefferson Davis.
[02:48:21.260 --> 02:48:26.260]  Well, all the way through the 20th century, the South was almost monolithically Democratic.
[02:48:26.260 --> 02:48:29.260]  And then later they had to come up with a new scam.
[02:48:29.260 --> 02:48:32.260]  Once that didn't work, the Democratic Party, they do a scam.
[02:48:32.260 --> 02:48:36.260]  When it gets exploded, they blame it on someone else and go on to a new one.
[02:48:36.260 --> 02:48:41.260]  And progressivism is just the latest manifestation of the same scam in a new guide.
[02:48:41.260 --> 02:48:43.260]  Dinesh, this is our guest, Hillary's America.
[02:48:43.260 --> 02:48:45.260]  This is not hype, folks.
[02:48:45.260 --> 02:48:47.260]  You've seen what our Hillary for Prison memes done.
[02:48:47.260 --> 02:48:49.260]  You've seen all our other memes devastate the globalists.
[02:48:49.260 --> 02:48:51.260]  Devastate this crime syndicate.
[02:48:51.260 --> 02:48:54.260]  Devastate the Saudi Arabians and their role in 9-11.
[02:48:54.260 --> 02:48:56.260]  Because you are tens of millions of listeners.
[02:48:56.260 --> 02:48:57.260]  You're the power.
[02:48:57.260 --> 02:49:02.260]  I'm just here going, hey, you know, you're like Ben Grimm and Fantastic Four trying to fight a midget.
[02:49:02.260 --> 02:49:04.260]  I mean, just if you decide to kick its ass, you're going to.
[02:49:04.260 --> 02:49:06.260]  So I'm just saying, hey, you want to run them over.
[02:49:06.260 --> 02:49:07.260]  There they are.
[02:49:07.260 --> 02:49:08.260]  Go see this film.
[02:49:08.260 --> 02:49:09.260]  Take 10 people to it.
[02:49:09.260 --> 02:49:13.260]  It will blow a big giant hole in the side of Hillary's ship.
[02:49:13.260 --> 02:49:14.260]  This is a big torpedo right here.
[02:49:14.260 --> 02:49:15.260]  Okay.
[02:49:15.260 --> 02:49:17.260]  That's why he already, this is a submarine.
[02:49:17.260 --> 02:49:21.260]  He already shot one torpedo at him and they put him in jail to try to stop this next one.
[02:49:21.260 --> 02:49:24.260]  I like that title, a torpedo.
[02:49:24.260 --> 02:49:27.260]  I'm going to tell my film team to start calling me that from now on.
[02:49:27.260 --> 02:49:28.260]  Well, no, I mean, it really is.
[02:49:28.260 --> 02:49:30.260]  Just call me torpedo.
[02:49:30.260 --> 02:49:32.260]  Well, because that's what we do.
[02:49:32.260 --> 02:49:33.260]  It's the truth, though.
[02:49:33.260 --> 02:49:36.260]  And what's great about this is, I mean, I, I think you really are.
[02:49:36.260 --> 02:49:37.260]  I mean, do you feel satisfied?
[02:49:37.260 --> 02:49:38.260]  People ask, are you proud?
[02:49:38.260 --> 02:49:39.260]  Alex, what you've done?
[02:49:39.260 --> 02:49:42.260]  No, I'm satisfied because, you know, I'm not a crook.
[02:49:42.260 --> 02:49:46.260]  I mean, people call me a big, you know, sentimental and stuff.
[02:49:46.260 --> 02:49:47.260]  Yeah, you know what?
[02:49:47.260 --> 02:49:50.260]  I do get a tear in my eye when they, when they have the national anthem.
[02:49:50.260 --> 02:49:54.260]  Well, it's also, you know, from a film point of view, just looking at it artistically,
[02:49:54.260 --> 02:49:56.260]  a lot of times Republicans are on the defensive.
[02:49:56.260 --> 02:49:57.260]  Oh, we didn't do that.
[02:49:57.260 --> 02:49:58.260]  We're not really guilty of this.
[02:49:58.260 --> 02:50:00.260]  No, we didn't make too much money.
[02:50:00.260 --> 02:50:01.260]  Oh, we earned the money we made.
[02:50:01.260 --> 02:50:06.260]  A really good film is a film that is on the attack from the beginning and never lets up.
[02:50:06.260 --> 02:50:07.260]  Exactly.
[02:50:07.260 --> 02:50:08.260]  And that's what this film does.
[02:50:08.260 --> 02:50:09.260]  It apologizes for nothing.
[02:50:09.260 --> 02:50:11.260]  There's nothing to apologize for.
[02:50:11.260 --> 02:50:12.260]  That's like me when people call me racist.
[02:50:12.260 --> 02:50:13.260]  I haven't done anything.
[02:50:13.260 --> 02:50:14.260]  I get mad at them.
[02:50:14.260 --> 02:50:17.260]  I'm not going to grovel and like virtue signal.
[02:50:17.260 --> 02:50:20.260]  So, we just opened the artillery from the beginning.
[02:50:20.260 --> 02:50:22.260]  We never stop.
[02:50:22.260 --> 02:50:24.260]  It gets actually more devastating as we go along.
[02:50:24.260 --> 02:50:28.260]  Now, the Democrats are kind of like lawyers and think of what lawyers do.
[02:50:28.260 --> 02:50:32.260]  Lawyers will be like, my client was nowhere to be seen on the side of the murder.
[02:50:32.260 --> 02:50:35.260]  Well, actually he was, but he didn't have a gun.
[02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:38.260]  Well, actually he had a gun, but he didn't kill all those people, just one guy.
[02:50:38.260 --> 02:50:42.260]  So, every time we make an indictment, the Democrats try to creep out of it.
[02:50:42.260 --> 02:50:47.260]  And so, we slam them at every point, taking on their defense until at the end, they have nothing left.
[02:50:47.260 --> 02:50:48.260]  You destroy them.
[02:50:48.260 --> 02:50:51.260]  They are truly an organization of criminals manipulating poor people.
[02:50:51.260 --> 02:50:53.260]  So, that's why they want to make more poor people.
[02:50:53.260 --> 02:50:56.260]  They're in competition against prosperity because it's like oxy's in the room.
[02:50:56.260 --> 02:50:57.260]  It pushes them out.
[02:50:57.260 --> 02:50:59.260]  We'll be back with a few of your phone calls with Nash and Suza.

[02:54:13.260 --> 02:54:16.260]  By the way folks, Dinesh and Suza was with us for a full hour.
[02:54:16.260 --> 02:54:19.260]  He loved the show but the traffic is so bad, stuff's so bad.
[02:54:19.260 --> 02:54:21.260]  I know I said callers for him. I apologize the callers.
[02:54:21.260 --> 02:54:23.260]  I'll hold over the next hour and take your calls.
[02:54:23.260 --> 02:54:29.260]  I said it's probably safer if they just left because it takes now 45 minutes to go for three miles.
[02:54:29.260 --> 02:54:33.260]  I mean it is just now that there's like checkpoints everywhere and protests are popping up.
[02:54:33.260 --> 02:54:37.260]  There's helicopters flying around and communist burning flags running around,
[02:54:37.260 --> 02:54:39.260]  foaming at the mouth and attacking people.
[02:54:39.260 --> 02:54:42.260]  So I just said why don't you just go because they were getting nervous.
[02:54:42.260 --> 02:54:43.260]  He was ready to stay.
[02:54:43.260 --> 02:54:47.260]  But Dinesh and Suza, man, just being with him in person, that guy's a hero.
[02:54:47.260 --> 02:54:53.260]  I mean that guy literally got thrown in prison for getting four friends to give him money to a campaign.
[02:54:53.260 --> 02:54:57.260]  I mean I gave money to Ron Paul once and they opened up some criminal investigation on me.
[02:54:57.260 --> 02:55:00.260]  It was like $2,000 and it was totally legal.
[02:55:00.260 --> 02:55:04.260]  But I learned behind the scenes that happened and then they had news articles come out about,
[02:55:04.260 --> 02:55:05.260]  oh, it was so horrible.
[02:55:05.260 --> 02:55:07.260]  I gave Ron Paul money, $2,000, totally legal.
[02:55:07.260 --> 02:55:14.260]  So they could have died of ham sandwich folks and I tell you, they've told me they're coming after me.
[02:55:14.260 --> 02:55:16.260]  I mean I've been threatened really bad.
[02:55:16.260 --> 02:55:17.260]  And you know what?
[02:55:17.260 --> 02:55:20.260]  At the end of the day, it's kind of like Dan Bongino, the Secret Service,
[02:55:20.260 --> 02:55:24.260]  they threatened even his kids and him and broken his house and his car.
[02:55:24.260 --> 02:55:27.260]  He just sat on there and he said, look, just let me catch you.
[02:55:27.260 --> 02:55:29.260]  Let me catch you in my house, okay?
[02:55:29.260 --> 02:55:31.260]  And you may get me.
[02:55:31.260 --> 02:55:32.260]  You probably will beat me.
[02:55:32.260 --> 02:55:36.260]  But I'm never a psychopath or a sociopath like you.
[02:55:36.260 --> 02:55:37.260]  I do care.
[02:55:37.260 --> 02:55:41.260]  And my life is so full and so strong and so big and yours isn't.
[02:55:41.260 --> 02:55:42.260]  I'm not a sociopath.
[02:55:42.260 --> 02:55:43.260]  I'm not a psychopath.
[02:55:43.260 --> 02:55:44.260]  I care about people.
[02:55:44.260 --> 02:55:47.260]  And it's not because I'm some goody two shoes either.
[02:55:47.260 --> 02:55:51.260]  It's just because, you know, I just am not a piece of filth, you know?
[02:55:51.260 --> 02:55:52.260]  And that's what it comes down to.
[02:55:52.260 --> 02:55:54.260]  You're going to get, you're going to get yours, club.
[02:55:54.260 --> 02:55:55.260]  It's like evil always does.
[02:55:55.260 --> 02:55:57.260]  You think you're invincible?
[02:55:57.260 --> 02:56:01.260]  I can feel the spirit of liberty rising across this planet in my gut,
[02:56:01.260 --> 02:56:03.260]  not as intellectually see it.
[02:56:03.260 --> 02:56:06.260]  Briefly, I got some really serious news.
[02:56:06.260 --> 02:56:09.260]  I don't even, it's really weird.
[02:56:09.260 --> 02:56:13.260]  Sometimes when I have really big news, I like hold off on it.
[02:56:13.260 --> 02:56:15.260]  It's like people think I got to appear on a fear monger.
[02:56:15.260 --> 02:56:17.260]  I want to give you bad news to be shocking.
[02:56:17.260 --> 02:56:20.260]  Most of the time I've got stacks of horrible stuff that's going on.
[02:56:20.260 --> 02:56:23.260]  And I actually don't even want to get to it.
[02:56:23.260 --> 02:56:26.260]  There's a lot of other issues to this, but let me just go ahead and get this
[02:56:26.260 --> 02:56:29.260]  report out in two minutes right now.
[02:56:29.260 --> 02:56:34.260]  We talked to our law enforcement sources a few hours ago,
[02:56:34.260 --> 02:56:42.260]  and there was a trash truck stolen in the early morning hours today.
[02:56:42.260 --> 02:56:45.260]  And the trash truck is missing.
[02:56:45.260 --> 02:56:49.260]  Obviously, most people don't even know how to drive a trash truck.
[02:56:49.260 --> 02:56:53.260]  And they're concerned that it could be a plan by an ISIS person
[02:56:53.260 --> 02:56:56.260]  or an ISIS sympathizer to run over crowds.
[02:56:56.260 --> 02:56:58.260]  And that's my gut to the crew.
[02:56:58.260 --> 02:56:59.260]  I said, I'm not worried about mass shootings.
[02:56:59.260 --> 02:57:02.260]  I'm worried about somebody plowing folks with a car.
[02:57:02.260 --> 02:57:05.260]  So we're dealing with that.
[02:57:05.260 --> 02:57:08.260]  Or it could obviously be loaded up with bombs or something
[02:57:08.260 --> 02:57:12.260]  and then driven into a barricade and detonate.
[02:57:12.260 --> 02:57:15.260]  People don't normally still trash trucks.
[02:57:15.260 --> 02:57:17.260]  Maybe it is a prank or something.
[02:57:17.260 --> 02:57:19.260]  But I think it's a very serious threat.
[02:57:19.260 --> 02:57:21.260]  And by the way, no one's breaking that.
[02:57:21.260 --> 02:57:23.260]  No one else knows that.
[02:57:23.260 --> 02:57:27.260]  We learned this from police sources.
[02:57:27.260 --> 02:57:29.260]  We talked to the Secret Service about it.
[02:57:29.260 --> 02:57:31.260]  And they said, yeah, of course we're aware of that.
[02:57:31.260 --> 02:57:34.260]  And by the way, we don't want that information out.
[02:57:34.260 --> 02:57:35.260]  Well, I'm sorry.
[02:57:35.260 --> 02:57:37.260]  That information is out.
[02:57:37.260 --> 02:57:38.260]  And I'm just going to put it out.
[02:57:38.260 --> 02:57:40.260]  My gut says put it out.
[02:57:40.260 --> 02:57:44.260]  Obviously whoever stole it may have done this.
[02:57:44.260 --> 02:57:47.260]  Also to just divert the police while they're planning something else.
[02:57:47.260 --> 02:57:49.260]  I don't think anybody knows.
[02:57:49.260 --> 02:57:53.260]  Maybe the mafia or something or some other group just stole the trash truck.
[02:57:53.260 --> 02:57:56.260]  But that's not really something there's a market for selling trash trucks
[02:57:56.260 --> 02:57:59.260]  because those are all run by different contractors or cities or municipalities.
[02:57:59.260 --> 02:58:00.260]  So you look at all the angles.
[02:58:00.260 --> 02:58:06.260]  A trash truck disappearing last night or this early this morning
[02:58:06.260 --> 02:58:08.260]  is a very, very serious issue.
[02:58:08.260 --> 02:58:11.260]  And we made some other phone calls and they were like, yeah,
[02:58:11.260 --> 02:58:13.260]  how do you know about the trash truck?
[02:58:13.260 --> 02:58:18.260]  So we're going to be watching that when you get a story out at infowars.com.
[02:58:18.260 --> 02:58:22.260]  In fact, Biggs was in there earlier giving me more information.
[02:58:22.260 --> 02:58:23.260]  He's outside.
[02:58:23.260 --> 02:58:25.260]  He's on the street with the flag burners.
[02:58:25.260 --> 02:58:27.260]  He put a report out on it.
[02:58:27.260 --> 02:58:31.260]  And so we'll get this clip down and put out his report as well.
[02:58:31.260 --> 02:58:35.260]  But look, if you see a trash truck, is somebody trying to run people over?
[02:58:35.260 --> 02:58:39.260]  Somebody needs to climb in that cab and take that person out.
[02:58:39.260 --> 02:58:40.260]  We'll be back.
[02:58:40.260 --> 02:58:43.260]  You are listening to GCN.

[02:59:41.260 --> 02:59:45.260]  So many people calling to my radio show and tell me how young Jebedy and the products
[02:59:45.260 --> 02:59:47.260]  at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[02:59:47.260 --> 02:59:49.260]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:59:49.260 --> 03:00:13.260]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:13.260 --> 03:00:21.260]  Alex Jones is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[03:00:21.260 --> 03:00:25.260]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:25.260 --> 03:00:29.260]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[03:00:29.260 --> 03:00:32.260]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:00:32.260 --> 03:00:37.260]  By the way, this whole Malania-Trump thing is a total distraction.
[03:00:37.260 --> 03:00:39.260]  But obviously this has been out for hours.
[03:00:39.260 --> 03:00:40.260]  I hadn't looked at it.
[03:00:40.260 --> 03:00:43.260]  The Trump Organization, this is what Roger Stone told me yesterday.
[03:00:43.260 --> 03:00:48.260]  Of course, it's been confirmed now that it was one of her friends that does PR for them,
[03:00:48.260 --> 03:00:52.260]  that took the speech that had been written by the speech writers and basically added that part in there.
[03:00:52.260 --> 03:00:56.260]  That was somewhat similar to what she had said.
[03:00:56.260 --> 03:01:00.260]  And they've offered their resignation and Trump hasn't taken it.
[03:01:00.260 --> 03:01:05.260]  I mean, we have the president openly trying to start a civil war in the country.
[03:01:05.260 --> 03:01:08.260]  We have all this garbage going on.
[03:01:08.260 --> 03:01:11.260]  And we've got the media focusing in on this.
[03:01:11.260 --> 03:01:14.260]  This is how they distract things.
[03:01:14.260 --> 03:01:16.260]  Again, I don't know what Trump's going to do once he gets in.
[03:01:16.260 --> 03:01:19.260]  I mean, I hope he does the things he said he'll do, at least part of them.
[03:01:19.260 --> 03:01:23.260]  But I know Hillary's a master criminal, and that's why I'm opposing her.
[03:01:23.260 --> 03:01:25.260]  And that's what it comes down to.
[03:01:25.260 --> 03:01:26.260]  Who's hosted the fourth hour today?
[03:01:26.260 --> 03:01:28.260]  I mean, we're already into it right now, but I forgot to ask.
[03:01:28.260 --> 03:01:32.260]  Who's doing that?
[03:01:32.260 --> 03:01:34.260]  David Knight always doing a great job.
[03:01:34.260 --> 03:01:36.260]  David Knight is going to be coming in.
[03:01:36.260 --> 03:01:38.260]  I do want to go to some of your phone calls.
[03:01:38.260 --> 03:01:40.260]  These calls just came in.
[03:01:40.260 --> 03:01:41.260]  I appreciate you holding.
[03:01:41.260 --> 03:01:48.260]  Again, as soon as it's gone now, but you can basically just put out your points to the rest of the general audience.
[03:01:48.260 --> 03:01:50.260]  Let's talk to Jesse in Texas.
[03:01:50.260 --> 03:01:51.260]  You're on the air.
[03:01:51.260 --> 03:01:53.260]  Go ahead.
[03:01:53.260 --> 03:01:55.260]  Hey, how's it going out?
[03:01:55.260 --> 03:01:56.260]  Good, brother.
[03:01:56.260 --> 03:02:05.260]  Hey, I was just, it was kind of shocking when you said about the trash truck because I have been thinking that there is going to be some kind of event.
[03:02:05.260 --> 03:02:07.260]  It's going to be more than likely planned.
[03:02:07.260 --> 03:02:13.260]  And at the RNC or the DNC, probably my guess is it's going to be at the DNC again.
[03:02:13.260 --> 03:02:19.260]  Hillary supporters are the BLM movement to get support for their side and to blame them.
[03:02:19.260 --> 03:02:21.260]  Well, the VVC of a trash truck runs over.
[03:02:21.260 --> 03:02:23.260]  A bunch of people, they won't say it's terrorism.
[03:02:23.260 --> 03:02:24.260]  And it was a jihadi that does it.
[03:02:24.260 --> 03:02:28.260]  They won't say it's a jihadi either because they control language like Carl Rove said.
[03:02:28.260 --> 03:02:29.260]  They control reality.
[03:02:29.260 --> 03:02:34.260]  And so it'll just be an act of love if they kill a bunch of people including children.
[03:02:34.260 --> 03:02:37.260]  To take control of reality, not you or I.
[03:02:37.260 --> 03:02:51.260]  Yeah, no, of course, but it'll be, I'm thinking it's going to happen at the DNC, but that is very strange that a trash truck, like you said, who steals a trash truck, there's no point for it.
[03:02:51.260 --> 03:02:53.260]  Yeah, folks are really concerned about it.
[03:02:53.260 --> 03:02:56.260]  And then they're looking for it all over the place and they're going to look out for it.
[03:02:56.260 --> 03:03:01.260]  But if you're at the RNC and you see a trash truck, you know, they didn't pick it up trash, but look out.
[03:03:01.260 --> 03:03:04.260]  Yeah, but yeah, you guys be safe out there.
[03:03:04.260 --> 03:03:05.260]  And thanks for taking my call.
[03:03:05.260 --> 03:03:06.260]  Thank you, brother.
[03:03:06.260 --> 03:03:07.260]  Appreciate that call.
[03:03:07.260 --> 03:03:13.260]  Let's go ahead and talk to Milton in Texas.
[03:03:13.260 --> 03:03:14.260]  You're on the air.
[03:03:14.260 --> 03:03:16.260]  Go ahead.
[03:03:16.260 --> 03:03:17.260]  How are you doing?
[03:03:17.260 --> 03:03:24.260]  I was just calling to ask, would you support a referendum for African American?
[03:03:24.260 --> 03:03:28.260]  A referendum on what specifically?
[03:03:28.260 --> 03:03:33.260]  An African American exit.
[03:03:33.260 --> 03:03:35.260]  An African American exit from the country?
[03:03:35.260 --> 03:03:41.260]  No, because you can't have a Republican vote to expel people.
[03:03:41.260 --> 03:03:44.260]  Or are you saying African Americans wanting to leave the U.S.?
[03:03:44.260 --> 03:03:47.260]  Some black nationalists want their own country.
[03:03:47.260 --> 03:03:52.260]  African Americans don't really need their own country just to separate like a Native American would.
[03:03:52.260 --> 03:03:55.260]  How they have a tribe and a American.
[03:03:55.260 --> 03:04:00.260]  So would you support African Americans trying to get that model?
[03:04:00.260 --> 03:04:06.260]  I mean, I think if people wanted on their own to do that, that's their right to do it.
[03:04:06.260 --> 03:04:10.260]  I don't think, I mean, I wouldn't push that and promote that.
[03:04:10.260 --> 03:04:17.260]  I mean, I'm going to put like, what, like 30 million people, like stick them in like the middle of the desert somewhere.
[03:04:17.260 --> 03:04:26.260]  I mean, I understand folks like wanting to leave, say, what was happening in Europe with religious oppression or whatever.
[03:04:26.260 --> 03:04:28.260]  Because then they wanted to be able to be Protestants or whatever.
[03:04:28.260 --> 03:04:31.260]  I mean, I get leaving if there was some new place to go.
[03:04:31.260 --> 03:04:36.260]  But if folks wanted to try to organize that and do that, that's their right to do it.
[03:04:36.260 --> 03:04:42.260]  I mean, I see something like New Hampshire, a free state project, where a bunch of libertarians get together on ideas, not on race.
[03:04:42.260 --> 03:04:45.260]  And then try to influence politics towards freedom.
[03:04:45.260 --> 03:04:47.260]  But that's a really good debate to have some time.
[03:04:47.260 --> 03:04:48.260]  I appreciate that question.
[03:04:48.260 --> 03:04:49.260]  Sorry, Dinesh.
[03:04:49.260 --> 03:04:51.260]  I just wasn't here to be able to get that.
[03:04:51.260 --> 03:04:52.260]  Thank you.
[03:04:52.260 --> 03:04:53.260]  David Nice can take over the baton.
[03:04:53.260 --> 03:04:54.260]  I'll probably want to take your calls.
[03:04:54.260 --> 03:04:55.260]  A lot of clips to play.
[03:04:55.260 --> 03:04:57.260]  A lot of news we haven't gotten to yet.
[03:04:57.260 --> 03:05:00.260]  So stay with us straight ahead and more tonight, 7 o'clock central.
[03:05:00.260 --> 03:05:01.260]  Big interviews coming up.
[03:05:01.260 --> 03:05:02.260]  Time to get serious.
[03:05:02.260 --> 03:05:06.260]  There's a new HIV vaccine to be trialed in South Africa later this year.
[03:05:06.260 --> 03:05:16.260]  ALVAC-HIV-GP120 is the official name of the vaccine, and it was tested on a small scale in a 50 person experiment to measure immune response.
[03:05:16.260 --> 03:05:26.260]  Linda Gail Becker, director of the Desmond Tutu HIV Center in Cape Town and leading the vaccine trials, claims that the small scale test was, quote, to see if the vaccine looks promising.
[03:05:26.260 --> 03:05:36.260]  The vaccine stems from a 2009 trial in Thailand, which resulted in 60% protection against HIV the first year, but afterward falling to 30% before the trials end.
[03:05:36.260 --> 03:05:43.260]  Gail Becker, in addition to Anthony Fauci, also working on the trial, intend to add adjuvants to strengthen the vaccine's potency.
[03:05:43.260 --> 03:05:45.260]  Oh yeah, like that's going to go over well.
[03:05:45.260 --> 03:05:49.260]  And awake people know what mass vaccine trials could possibly mean.
[03:05:49.260 --> 03:05:52.260]  Prepare the genocide preparations.
[03:05:52.260 --> 03:05:57.260]  Click on CNN.com. This is Gabe Goldimand for Infowars.com.
[03:06:23.260 --> 03:06:31.260]  Right now with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites.
[03:06:31.260 --> 03:06:33.260]  Tell us about all the stuff that's said. There's so many things that are in it.
[03:06:33.260 --> 03:06:41.260]  You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[03:06:41.260 --> 03:06:44.260]  All right. Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:06:44.260 --> 03:06:52.260]  We just came back in yesterday. Living Defense. InfowarsLife.com. And folks, you can't lose. It's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[03:06:52.260 --> 03:06:56.260]  And you support the broadcast. InfowarsLife.com. Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[03:06:56.260 --> 03:07:17.260]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[03:07:26.260 --> 03:07:31.260]  Intensifying civil unrest. You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[03:07:31.260 --> 03:07:38.260]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week. Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[03:07:38.260 --> 03:07:45.260]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for Infowars listeners.
[03:07:45.260 --> 03:07:50.260]  So it's a good time to check it out. Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[03:07:50.260 --> 03:07:54.260]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[03:07:54.260 --> 03:08:01.260]  Go to gridwars.com. That's gridwars.com.
[03:08:25.260 --> 03:08:33.260]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show on this fourth hour of the Wednesday, July 20th, 2016 show.
[03:08:33.260 --> 03:08:40.260]  Of course, we're right in the middle of the Republican Convention and Cleveland and Alex was there live talking to Dinesh Tussouza and others.
[03:08:40.260 --> 03:08:51.260]  And I want to talk in this hour about some, another example that broke this week of political privilege.
[03:08:51.260 --> 03:08:57.260]  We hear a lot about white privilege. We don't hear the liberals ringing their hands over political privilege.
[03:08:57.260 --> 03:09:07.260]  Do you think that's a bit of a problem? Well, we've got another example of it now with Julian Castro, the guy who is the Health and Urban Development Secretary.
[03:09:07.260 --> 03:09:18.260]  He has had an investigation and like the FBI, they said, yeah, he broke the law. No foul, no penalty, nothing's going to happen to him.
[03:09:18.260 --> 03:09:23.260]  Okay, so we're going to talk about what's behind that. He violated the Hatch Act.
[03:09:23.260 --> 03:09:34.260]  But I think it has some ties with what Ruth Bader Ginsburg said about a week and a half ago when she came out in a couple of different interviews criticizing Donald Trump.
[03:09:34.260 --> 03:09:39.260]  It was pretty unprecedented. She was criticized for it from the Washington Post.
[03:09:39.260 --> 03:09:44.260]  Certainly not Trump fans there. A lot of law professors waited in on that.
[03:09:44.260 --> 03:09:56.260]  I think it highlights the fact that the Supreme Court has become nothing but a bunch of political activists who have been appointed for life and are totally unaccountable to the public.
[03:09:56.260 --> 03:09:59.260]  I think it shows the corruption of the Supreme Court.
[03:09:59.260 --> 03:10:02.260]  She was criticized in the Washington Post to the Wall Street Journal.
[03:10:02.260 --> 03:10:06.260]  Many others talked about what she had to say. Eventually she walked back those comments.
[03:10:06.260 --> 03:10:10.260]  But you know, quite frankly, I'll make the case. I think she violated the Hatch Act as well.
[03:10:10.260 --> 03:10:16.260]  Not that anything will ever happen to her either. And I want to talk to one of the people on hold here.
[03:10:16.260 --> 03:10:23.260]  Garson in Missouri, hang on there. I know you're a retired law professor and I want to get your comments on this since you're a law professor.
[03:10:23.260 --> 03:10:26.260]  I mean, it certainly looks to me like what she did was violate the Hatch Act.
[03:10:26.260 --> 03:10:30.260]  We're going to talk a little bit about the tempest about plagiarism.
[03:10:30.260 --> 03:10:33.260]  You know, there was an interesting comment from Donald Trump.
[03:10:33.260 --> 03:10:40.260]  He said the media has spent more time analyzing Melania than the FBI did investigating Hillary Clinton.
[03:10:40.260 --> 03:10:51.260]  And that's true to some degree. You know what, though, there's no criminal penalty for plagiarism like there is for violating, knowingly violating,
[03:10:51.260 --> 03:10:58.260]  planning and setting up an infrastructure to violate security law regulations that we have in our government.
[03:10:58.260 --> 03:11:09.260]  And real quickly, before we get to the Hatch Act, I want to talk to you about the economic collapse we see happening in Venezuela and what's going to be happening in this country as well.
[03:11:09.260 --> 03:11:18.260]  You know, we see the elites in financial times. They're talking about being concerned about the populist rage that's coming on.
[03:11:18.260 --> 03:11:28.260]  Of course, at the Bilderberg meeting, they were concerned about the precarious position of the proletariat, you know, those of us on the bottom.
[03:11:28.260 --> 03:11:30.260]  The elites are taking notice. They think they have to do something.
[03:11:30.260 --> 03:11:39.260]  They're concerned about the rise of Brexit, of Donald Trump and of other issues that show that we've woken up to what they're doing to us.
[03:11:39.260 --> 03:11:43.260]  And of course, they're admitting that their policies are destroying our way of life.
[03:11:43.260 --> 03:11:47.260]  But then they keep pushing back against anything that would change any of their policies.
[03:11:47.260 --> 03:11:54.260]  Here's a good example of what's going to happen to us if we keep going down this road of socialism, of globalism.
[03:11:54.260 --> 03:12:02.260]  Look at Venezuela. They've got inflation that is now set to top 1,600% next year. This is from MarketWatch.
[03:12:02.260 --> 03:12:11.260]  They said inflation has been 480% this year. Next year, they expect it to be 1,640%.
[03:12:11.260 --> 03:12:15.260]  All right. Can you get your head around those numbers? Does that really mean anything to you?
[03:12:15.260 --> 03:12:20.260]  Let me talk about billions of dollars and tens of trillions of dollars in debt.
[03:12:20.260 --> 03:12:25.260]  And I guess so large. It's just a statistic. You really can't grasp it.
[03:12:25.260 --> 03:12:29.260]  Let's talk about what that means for a gallon of milk.
[03:12:29.260 --> 03:12:37.260]  If a gallon of milk was $3 last year with 480% inflation, that would mean this year it'd be $14.40.
[03:12:37.260 --> 03:12:42.260]  Getting pretty expensive. With 1,640% inflation next year,
[03:12:42.260 --> 03:12:49.260]  that same $3 gallon milk from last year, next year would cost $236.
[03:12:49.260 --> 03:12:53.260]  $236. That's Venezuela.
[03:12:53.260 --> 03:12:57.260]  You know, Margaret Thatcher said, the problem with socialism, you eventually run out of other people's money.
[03:12:57.260 --> 03:13:02.260]  Well, you eventually run out of all the fiat currency that you print as well.
[03:13:02.260 --> 03:13:08.260]  You just can't print it fast enough. And you can't earn it fast enough either.
[03:13:08.260 --> 03:13:12.260]  Here we had a CNN article. This is up on Dredge Report.
[03:13:12.260 --> 03:13:16.260]  Hungry Venezuelans cry at the site of food.
[03:13:16.260 --> 03:13:20.260]  I mentioned this earlier. This week, how you had over 100,000 Venezuelans
[03:13:20.260 --> 03:13:24.260]  crossed the border into Colombia trying to get food.
[03:13:24.260 --> 03:13:28.260]  And as the CNN story points out in the first paragraph, they say, pregnant women, children,
[03:13:28.260 --> 03:13:35.260]  even elderly Venezuelans crossed into Colombia Sunday after the border was temporarily reopened,
[03:13:35.260 --> 03:13:39.260]  allowing them to buy basic foods and toiletries.
[03:13:39.260 --> 03:13:42.260]  They instead have become rare in Venezuela.
[03:13:42.260 --> 03:13:51.260]  Tearful Venezuelans had gone weeks without basic food items like milk, flour, toilet paper, so forth.
[03:13:51.260 --> 03:13:55.260]  This is where this is headed. Where are we, however?
[03:13:55.260 --> 03:14:00.260]  The Financial Times is talking about the global elite need to heed the warning of populist rage.
[03:14:00.260 --> 03:14:05.260]  Let's say aspirants to power, such as Donald Trump in the US and Marine Le Pen in France,
[03:14:05.260 --> 03:14:09.260]  offer clear, simple, and what they say, wrong solutions.
[03:14:09.260 --> 03:14:13.260]  What would be wrong? Well, it's nationalism, nativism, protectionism.
[03:14:13.260 --> 03:14:18.260]  I think that's a mischaracterization of some of what is being put out there, protectionism.
[03:14:18.260 --> 03:14:23.260]  But yeah, we should protect our own businesses first. We should put America first.
[03:14:23.260 --> 03:14:26.260]  You want to call that protectionism? Fine.
[03:14:26.260 --> 03:14:32.260]  You want to call that protectionism that started the depression. It was the Federal Reserve.
[03:14:32.260 --> 03:14:37.260]  You don't believe me? Ask Ben Bernanke. He was the one who said, we did it.
[03:14:37.260 --> 03:14:41.260]  Sorry, we won't do it again, except follow the same policies.
[03:14:41.260 --> 03:14:45.260]  They say the remedies they offer are bogus, but the illnesses are real.
[03:14:45.260 --> 03:14:51.260]  If governing elites continue to fail to offer convincing cures, they might soon be swept away.
[03:14:51.260 --> 03:14:55.260]  Let's hope so. Now, let's get this camera here on the top here.
[03:14:55.260 --> 03:14:59.260]  This graph here, the big hit. Look at this bar chart here.
[03:14:59.260 --> 03:15:07.260]  The percent of households by country with flat or falling real market incomes from 2005 to 2012.
[03:15:07.260 --> 03:15:15.260]  Italy, nearly 95% of the households in Italy have flat or falling real income.
[03:15:15.260 --> 03:15:20.260]  Second is the United States. Second is the United States.
[03:15:20.260 --> 03:15:24.260]  Now, Obama tells us that we're better off in every way. Really? Really?
[03:15:24.260 --> 03:15:30.260]  Let me tell you something. China is better off than we are. Far better, far more stable than we are.
[03:15:30.260 --> 03:15:36.260]  Because the people, even though their income level, even though their wealth level is far below that of the United States,
[03:15:36.260 --> 03:15:42.260]  they see it increasing rapidly. I saw that when I was there adopting my daughter.
[03:15:42.260 --> 03:15:51.260]  Where the problems start is when people see their income levels flattening and falling as we do here in America.
[03:15:51.260 --> 03:15:59.260]  That's about 82% they're saying here in America. Now, the UK and the Netherlands average of 25 countries is about 70%
[03:15:59.260 --> 03:16:04.260]  of people in these western countries see their income levels flat or falling.
[03:16:04.260 --> 03:16:11.260]  But here in the United States, we're higher than that. We're 82%. Yet Obama tells us everything is just fine.
[03:16:11.260 --> 03:16:19.260]  And they go on to say, citizenship of their nations is the most valuable asset owned by most people in wealthy countries.
[03:16:19.260 --> 03:16:27.260]  Think about that. Do you ever think about citizenship being your asset? It is. It is. It is your most valuable asset.
[03:16:27.260 --> 03:16:37.260]  They resent sharing this with outsiders. I certainly do. I don't see that everyone else in the world has a right to become an American.
[03:16:37.260 --> 03:16:44.260]  And that we have to justify denying them that right. That's an inversion of reality that has been sold to us by the Democrats.
[03:16:44.260 --> 03:16:50.260]  And I would say that as they're bringing in, as we see virtually every day, another terrorist act.
[03:16:50.260 --> 03:16:58.260]  They go in and they bomb these countries. I've got articles here about another 50 people who have been killed this last week.
[03:16:58.260 --> 03:17:04.260]  You've got 21 civilians killed in an ISIS stronghold in Syria. That's just one, one town.
[03:17:04.260 --> 03:17:10.260]  France 24 is talking about. US-led bombings in Syria kill 77 civilians, including many children.
[03:17:10.260 --> 03:17:14.260]  Okay, this was on Monday and Tuesday throughout Syria.
[03:17:14.260 --> 03:17:22.260]  So we're going in and we're killing, we started this war. We created this civil war to overthrow a political leader that we don't like.
[03:17:22.260 --> 03:17:30.260]  We are arming and training ISIS, which is far worse than the civilian dictator that they had.
[03:17:30.260 --> 03:17:38.260]  But regardless, the people that are there see the collateral damage. They see the bombs falling on civilians.
[03:17:38.260 --> 03:17:44.260]  What do you think they're going to think of America? Do they really care who started this?
[03:17:44.260 --> 03:17:49.260]  Who's right or wrong when they see their families being killed from the sky?
[03:17:49.260 --> 03:17:53.260]  And then what do we do? We have Obama bringing them to America.
[03:17:53.260 --> 03:17:58.260]  They start civil wars in other countries and now they're starting a civil war in this country.
[03:17:58.260 --> 03:18:06.260]  Bringing the people who we have been killing, bringing the people who have a righteous chip on their shoulder.
[03:18:06.260 --> 03:18:09.260]  For the war that we've brought to their country, they're going to bring that war here.
[03:18:09.260 --> 03:18:15.260]  They're going to grab a garbage truck, as you just heard Alex Jones talking about, or they're going to rent a 18-wheeler.
[03:18:15.260 --> 03:18:20.260]  Or they're going to grab an axe or a knife and they're going to kill whoever is closest to them.
[03:18:20.260 --> 03:18:27.260]  Those are the people we're bringing here. Those are the people John Kerry is bringing, is bragging to Muslims on the last day of Ramadan.
[03:18:27.260 --> 03:18:32.260]  Said we're going to get 10,000 people in here from Syria, right there, where this war is the hottest.
[03:18:32.260 --> 03:18:36.260]  They're going to bring 10,000 people in by September the 30th.
[03:18:36.260 --> 03:18:41.260]  It's going to be six times, he said, the number of people we brought in last year.
[03:18:41.260 --> 03:18:46.260]  Have they vetted them? Can they vet them? No, of course they can't.
[03:18:46.260 --> 03:18:55.260]  People should not be coming into this country unless they can demonstrate to us that they are not a risk to our security.
[03:18:55.260 --> 03:18:59.260]  But there's no control. As a matter of fact, they do everything they can to bring these people in.
[03:18:59.260 --> 03:19:03.260]  Now I'm going to begin with this, and I did lose a caller there.
[03:19:03.260 --> 03:19:08.260]  I want to go through this Hatch Act circumstance. This is on Monday this broke.
[03:19:08.260 --> 03:19:17.260]  Remember the Castro brothers? We had one of them go with Obama to Vietnam to push the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[03:19:17.260 --> 03:19:26.260]  He's a congressman. The other twin brother is the head of Housing and Urban Development, Julian Castro.
[03:19:26.260 --> 03:19:29.260]  He was touted as a possible running mate for Hillary Clinton.
[03:19:29.260 --> 03:19:35.260]  And there's a lot of talk now this week about the deep stakes on the Democrat side.
[03:19:35.260 --> 03:19:42.260]  On Monday, he was found guilty by the internal investigation.
[03:19:42.260 --> 03:19:47.260]  This was reported by the Washington Post and many other outlets, although you haven't heard much about it.
[03:19:47.260 --> 03:19:53.260]  They managed to release this information as the Republican Convention was starting, so you wouldn't notice it.
[03:19:53.260 --> 03:19:59.260]  But we're going to shine a spotlight on it when we come back. Stay with us, we'll be right back.
[03:19:59.260 --> 03:20:05.260]  Men, if you're like me, you appreciate the feeling of a clean, smooth shave from a quality blade.
[03:20:05.260 --> 03:20:09.260]  The sort of shave that cuts clean without the burn.
[03:20:09.260 --> 03:20:14.260]  So why are you messing around with generic razors that cost 32 bucks for an 8-pack?
[03:20:14.260 --> 03:20:19.260]  When you can shave with Harry's high quality German engineered blades for half the price.
[03:20:19.260 --> 03:20:25.260]  And because Harry's is so confident in the quality of their blades, they'll send you their most popular set.

[03:22:05.260 --> 03:22:08.260]  You are not going to want to miss this important message. Here's why.
[03:22:08.260 --> 03:22:12.260]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse.
[03:22:12.260 --> 03:22:17.260]  So please listen. Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[03:22:17.260 --> 03:22:20.260]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently.
[03:22:20.260 --> 03:22:24.260]  Amid no fumes or gases and produce electricity from the sun.
[03:22:24.260 --> 03:22:28.260]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest.
[03:22:28.260 --> 03:22:31.260]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[03:22:31.260 --> 03:22:33.260]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[03:22:33.260 --> 03:22:38.260]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[03:22:38.260 --> 03:22:42.260]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear
[03:22:42.260 --> 03:22:45.260]  in addition to the low price for infowars listeners.

[03:24:06.260 --> 03:24:09.260]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[03:24:09.260 --> 03:24:13.260]  We're going to talk about the Hatch Act Conviction without penalty, of course.
[03:24:13.260 --> 03:24:18.260]  I think it's something we should pay attention to in the light of Dinesh D'Souza
[03:24:18.260 --> 03:24:22.260]  just being on with Alex Jones, somebody who went to jail.
[03:24:22.260 --> 03:24:25.260]  It was unprecedented. Nobody has ever gone to jail
[03:24:25.260 --> 03:24:29.260]  for having donated more money to somebody than was legally allowed.
[03:24:29.260 --> 03:24:31.260]  It wasn't that amount, large amount of money.
[03:24:31.260 --> 03:24:38.260]  I think the limit is $2,500. He gave $25,000 to a college friend who was running for office.
[03:24:38.260 --> 03:24:43.260]  He was not buying influence unlike the Clintons, and yet they sent him to jail.
[03:24:43.260 --> 03:24:47.260]  Always in the past. It was just a fine if you violated the law.
[03:24:47.260 --> 03:24:50.260]  But they sent him to jail. He truly is a political prisoner.
[03:24:50.260 --> 03:24:54.260]  I want to give you a couple of examples of how Hillary does it
[03:24:54.260 --> 03:24:57.260]  and how Hillary gets away with it.
[03:24:57.260 --> 03:25:02.260]  Before we do, real quickly, I just want to remind you that our special 25% off DNA force
[03:25:02.260 --> 03:25:04.260]  is going to be ending tonight.
[03:25:04.260 --> 03:25:09.260]  We are running out of stock. We need to set some aside for auto-ship,
[03:25:09.260 --> 03:25:11.260]  and so that will be ending tonight.
[03:25:11.260 --> 03:25:15.260]  And, of course, DNA force is one of our most expensive products.
[03:25:15.260 --> 03:25:20.260]  The reasons for it is because of the key ingredient, BiopQQ.
[03:25:20.260 --> 03:25:24.260]  That compound costs us about $30,000 per batch.
[03:25:24.260 --> 03:25:27.260]  It's expensive to do a batch. It is difficult to do it.
[03:25:27.260 --> 03:25:29.260]  Once we run out of stock, we're out for several months.
[03:25:29.260 --> 03:25:33.260]  We have to set some aside for those of you who are on auto-ship.
[03:25:33.260 --> 03:25:38.260]  But right now is a great time to stock up on it while it is 25% off
[03:25:38.260 --> 03:25:41.260]  because it is such an expensive product to do.
[03:25:41.260 --> 03:25:43.260]  It's got a lot of ingredients in it.
[03:25:43.260 --> 03:25:48.260]  Things like digestive enzymes, CoQ10, Reservatrol, other things.
[03:25:48.260 --> 03:25:53.260]  But the key ingredient, and you can see this is backed by 175 clinical studies,
[03:25:53.260 --> 03:25:55.260]  is the BiopQQ.
[03:25:55.260 --> 03:25:58.260]  So look that up. Do your own research.
[03:25:58.260 --> 03:26:00.260]  Take a look at the reviews that are on the site,
[03:26:00.260 --> 03:26:03.260]  and take advantage of this sale before it ends.
[03:26:03.260 --> 03:26:09.260]  Also, don't forget, we still have Hillary for Prison T-shirts at infowarsstore.com.
[03:26:09.260 --> 03:26:14.260]  It's a great time to stock up on Hillary for Prison T-shirts with all of these conventions coming up,
[03:26:14.260 --> 03:26:19.260]  especially the one next week where there's going to be going to prison,
[03:26:19.260 --> 03:26:23.260]  or where she'd be going to the presidency, the big house or the White House.
[03:26:23.260 --> 03:26:27.260]  That's what's going to be decided in just a couple of months, and that begins this next week.
[03:26:27.260 --> 03:26:29.260]  Now, let's talk about Hillary.
[03:26:29.260 --> 03:26:31.260]  There was an article on Heat Street.
[03:26:31.260 --> 03:26:34.260]  And remember, as we're talking about Dinesh D'Souza,
[03:26:34.260 --> 03:26:38.260]  now trying to buy influence, being sent to jail for a campaign contribution,
[03:26:38.260 --> 03:26:41.260]  remember how the Clintons play this.
[03:26:41.260 --> 03:26:45.260]  Remember 20 years ago, the scandals with the Democrat National Committee in the Clintons,
[03:26:45.260 --> 03:26:48.260]  with the Chinese people, Charlie Tree and others.
[03:26:48.260 --> 03:26:50.260]  Eventually, they got these guys to confess.
[03:26:50.260 --> 03:26:54.260]  They gave them immunity so that they would talk freely about what had happened.
[03:26:54.260 --> 03:26:57.260]  That is always typically used to get convictions of the higher-up criminals.
[03:26:57.260 --> 03:27:01.260]  In this case, no, because the higher-up criminals were the Clintons.
[03:27:01.260 --> 03:27:03.260]  So they just said, oh, that's what you did.
[03:27:03.260 --> 03:27:05.260]  Okay, thanks a lot. That's very interesting to know.
[03:27:05.260 --> 03:27:07.260]  They were buying influence with you.
[03:27:07.260 --> 03:27:10.260]  You have immunity because we gave that to you to testify.
[03:27:10.260 --> 03:27:13.260]  But we're not going to use that testimony to get anybody else.
[03:27:13.260 --> 03:27:14.260]  We just gave you immunity.
[03:27:14.260 --> 03:27:15.260]  Now, look at this.
[03:27:15.260 --> 03:27:19.260]  How the Clintons and the rest of Washington are going to get rich from the coup in Turkey.
[03:27:19.260 --> 03:27:21.260]  Now, of course, we've got the two political power centers.
[03:27:21.260 --> 03:27:23.260]  We've got Erdogan and Gulen.
[03:27:23.260 --> 03:27:24.260]  Erdogan is the president.
[03:27:24.260 --> 03:27:26.260]  They tried the military coup.
[03:27:26.260 --> 03:27:30.260]  Did he do a false-flag military coup, as his opponents claim?
[03:27:30.260 --> 03:27:36.260]  Or was it something that was done by the people who were followers of Fatala Gulen,
[03:27:36.260 --> 03:27:39.260]  of whom there are many in that country?
[03:27:39.260 --> 03:27:41.260]  He is an exile.
[03:27:41.260 --> 03:27:45.260]  Fatala Gulen is a Turkish imam who is an exile in America.
[03:27:45.260 --> 03:27:52.260]  And of course, we talked to Mark Hall, who did a documentary about his influence on education in this country.
[03:27:52.260 --> 03:27:57.260]  We have charter schools that allow taxpayer money to be given to private groups.
[03:27:57.260 --> 03:28:00.260]  Now, that's a problem for a crony capitalism.
[03:28:00.260 --> 03:28:02.260]  If you don't understand how that works, you need to see the documentary.
[03:28:02.260 --> 03:28:04.260]  But they looked at the very worst case.
[03:28:04.260 --> 03:28:19.260]  What if we had some group come here and try to influence our children to try to get them to embrace the culture, the politics of a foreign country, or a different religion?
[03:28:19.260 --> 03:28:23.260]  Now, they can't overtly do it with religion, or they lose the money.
[03:28:23.260 --> 03:28:27.260]  But he has a thousand schools worldwide, Fatala Gulen does.
[03:28:27.260 --> 03:28:31.260]  Everywhere else, they're run as overt madrasas.
[03:28:31.260 --> 03:28:34.260]  Here, they teach people the Turkish language. You need to know that, don't you?
[03:28:34.260 --> 03:28:43.260]  If you're going to school in America, you should learn how to speak Turkish, not Spanish or some other foreign language, right?
[03:28:43.260 --> 03:28:44.260]  Turkish is what you need to know.
[03:28:44.260 --> 03:28:50.260]  And they send people, including a lot of local and federal officials, on junkets to Turkey.
[03:28:50.260 --> 03:28:52.260]  It's a very large network.
[03:28:52.260 --> 03:28:56.260]  They get a half a billion dollars in taxpayer money for these school networks.
[03:28:56.260 --> 03:29:01.260]  And they've been investigated for corruption, for bid rigging by the FBI, by many others as well.
[03:29:01.260 --> 03:29:05.260]  Now, they've been accused by the Turkish government of being involved in that coup.
[03:29:05.260 --> 03:29:07.260]  We don't know, okay?
[03:29:07.260 --> 03:29:08.260]  It could be either one of them.
[03:29:08.260 --> 03:29:09.260]  Both of them have ties to our government.
[03:29:09.260 --> 03:29:13.260]  Both of them, both Erdogan and Gulen, have ties to the CIA.
[03:29:13.260 --> 03:29:20.260]  Both of them are capable of this type of action of trying to start a military coup, or even of doing a false flag military coup.
[03:29:20.260 --> 03:29:22.260]  Neither of them are good guys.
[03:29:22.260 --> 03:29:24.260]  But how is this going to work out?
[03:29:24.260 --> 03:29:29.260]  We've got the Podesta Group, which is connected to the Clintons, okay?
[03:29:29.260 --> 03:29:34.260]  Registered in May to start lobbying for the Alliance for Shared Values.
[03:29:34.260 --> 03:29:41.260]  And as they point out in Heat Street, that comically named organization supports Fatala Gulen, the Pennsylvania-based imam.
[03:29:41.260 --> 03:29:43.260]  And they have made a lot of money.
[03:29:43.260 --> 03:29:45.260]  That's the way the Clintons make money.
[03:29:45.260 --> 03:29:47.260]  They don't go to jail, like the next Jesus.
[03:29:47.260 --> 03:29:49.260]  Stay with us and be right back.
[03:29:49.260 --> 03:29:50.260]  We're on the march.
[03:29:50.260 --> 03:29:53.260]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.260 --> 03:29:56.260]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:24.260 --> 03:30:26.260]  To see if the vaccine looks promising.
[03:30:26.260 --> 03:30:33.260]  The vaccine stems from a 2009 trial in Thailand, which resulted in 60% protection against HIV the first year,
[03:30:33.260 --> 03:30:36.260]  but afterward falling to 30% before the trial's end.
[03:30:36.260 --> 03:30:40.260]  Gail Becker, in addition to Anthony Fauci, also working on the trial,
[03:30:40.260 --> 03:30:43.260]  intend to add adjuvants to strengthen the vaccine's potency.
[03:30:43.260 --> 03:30:45.260]  Oh yeah, like that's going to go over well.
[03:30:45.260 --> 03:30:49.260]  And awake people know what mass vaccine trials could possibly mean.
[03:30:49.260 --> 03:30:52.260]  Prepare the genocide preparations.
[03:30:52.260 --> 03:30:54.260]  Here's an article on CNN.com.
[03:30:54.260 --> 03:31:23.260]  Dave Goldiman for infowars.com.
[03:31:25.260 --> 03:31:30.260]  As it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:31:30.260 --> 03:31:37.260]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut,
[03:31:37.260 --> 03:31:43.260]  which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:31:43.260 --> 03:31:45.260]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:31:45.260 --> 03:31:51.260]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.

[03:33:21.260 --> 03:33:26.260]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. I'm David Knight.
[03:33:26.260 --> 03:33:31.260]  We were talking about when we went to break, we were talking about the Turkish coup and how, really,
[03:33:31.260 --> 03:33:38.260]  both sides of the political establishment here in Washington are going to make a lot of money off of this.
[03:33:38.260 --> 03:33:46.260]  In Turkey, the two sides are Fatala Gulen and Erdogan, and they have both bought political influence here.
[03:33:46.260 --> 03:33:52.260]  That's the way that it works. Both of them have ties to the CIA, even though they are opponents of each other.
[03:33:52.260 --> 03:34:00.260]  In Turkey, we've got the CIA fighting itself like it does in most conflicts on both sides of the conflict.
[03:34:00.260 --> 03:34:06.260]  But look at the money trail. This is a story from Heat Street, and they're talking about, as I mentioned just before we went to break,
[03:34:06.260 --> 03:34:20.260]  the Podesta Group says that the Podesta Group that Hillary and Bill have been a part of have now registered as lobbyists for Fatala Gulen.
[03:34:20.260 --> 03:34:28.260]  Now, they point out in this article, Chuck Ross, a daily caller, says that Gulen allies have given money directly to the Hillary Clinton campaign.
[03:34:28.260 --> 03:34:31.260]  Do you have a problem with that? I mean, I do.
[03:34:31.260 --> 03:34:40.260]  I don't like to see influence being bought. I don't understand why people in the Democrat Party are so concerned about Wall Street influence,
[03:34:40.260 --> 03:34:47.260]  and they should be, but they're not concerned about foreign influence from China, from Turkey, from others, okay?
[03:34:47.260 --> 03:34:58.260]  So they have given money to the Hillary Clinton campaign and to the Clinton Global Initiative, as well as between a half and one million dollars to the Clinton Foundation.
[03:34:58.260 --> 03:35:02.260]  They're spreading the money around. The Fatala Gulen people are with the Clintons.
[03:35:02.260 --> 03:35:06.260]  And she, meanwhile, says that the Stranglehold, this is a quote from Hillary,
[03:35:06.260 --> 03:35:11.260]  the Stranglehold of wealthy special interests in Washington needs to end.
[03:35:11.260 --> 03:35:17.260]  So, you know, I guess maybe it's just American special interests that she doesn't like in Washington,
[03:35:17.260 --> 03:35:23.260]  but foreign governments are free to buy all the influence that they want, you know, whether it's Turkey or Saudi Arabia or whatever.
[03:35:23.260 --> 03:35:32.260]  Meanwhile, they said, as I point out in Heat Street, she is vacuuming up millions of dollars in donations from individuals and entities,
[03:35:32.260 --> 03:35:36.260]  and we know how this is going to play out if she becomes president.
[03:35:36.260 --> 03:35:41.260]  On the other side, we've got Republicans and Democrats making money from Erdogan.
[03:35:41.260 --> 03:35:46.260]  We've got the Turkish Embassy in Washington getting money from the Gephart Group,
[03:35:46.260 --> 03:35:54.260]  that's led by former House Majority Leader Dick Gephart, as well as also hiring Vin Weber's lobbyist group.
[03:35:54.260 --> 03:36:00.260]  Okay, so it's working in both ways. That's how Washington has played itself out.
[03:36:00.260 --> 03:36:05.260]  So, they go in and they create problems, and then these people try to buy influence from them.
[03:36:05.260 --> 03:36:09.260]  Of course, Erdogan is trying to extradite Fatala Gulen.
[03:36:09.260 --> 03:36:12.260]  As we pointed out in the interview that I had with Mark Hall on Sunday,
[03:36:12.260 --> 03:36:17.260]  it also has consequences for NATO, has consequences for U.S. military base,
[03:36:17.260 --> 03:36:22.260]  it has consequences for the relationship that we have between us and Russia.
[03:36:22.260 --> 03:36:25.260]  Turkey is playing that card as well.
[03:36:25.260 --> 03:36:30.260]  Trying to move closer to Russia has shut down the U.S. military base.
[03:36:30.260 --> 03:36:32.260]  I don't know if that's been reopened or not.
[03:36:32.260 --> 03:36:37.260]  Certainly, there's no good side in this Turkish situation.
[03:36:37.260 --> 03:36:47.260]  But let's take a look. As you're looking at how this Turkish imam who has 150 schools here in America,
[03:36:47.260 --> 03:36:51.260]  where they are indoctrinating about 60,000 American children,
[03:36:51.260 --> 03:36:56.260]  and he is buying millions of dollars of influence from Hillary Clinton,
[03:36:56.260 --> 03:37:04.260]  as you look at that, consider the person who had been touted as one of the strongest running mates for Hillary Clinton, Julian Castro.
[03:37:04.260 --> 03:37:08.260]  The Castro brothers, the twin brothers, one is a congressman,
[03:37:08.260 --> 03:37:13.260]  the other is now a secretary of housing and urban development.
[03:37:13.260 --> 03:37:19.260]  Their mother was one of the founding members of the race, La Raza,
[03:37:19.260 --> 03:37:23.260]  the explicitly racist Hispanic group.
[03:37:23.260 --> 03:37:27.260]  And they were touting him as a key possible choice for a running mate.
[03:37:27.260 --> 03:37:30.260]  We're going to look at some of the other possible choices of running mate
[03:37:30.260 --> 03:37:33.260]  that people are putting forward to Hillary Clinton.
[03:37:33.260 --> 03:37:45.260]  But it was on Monday that several news outlets reported that an investigation by the U.S. Office of Special Counsel said that he had violated the Hatch Act.
[03:37:45.260 --> 03:37:47.260]  Now, what is the Hatch Act?
[03:37:47.260 --> 03:37:49.260]  This goes back to 1939.
[03:37:49.260 --> 03:37:57.260]  It's officially titled An Act to Prevent Pernicious Political Activities for Federal Employees.
[03:37:57.260 --> 03:38:05.260]  The main provision prohibits employees in the executive branch of the federal government except for the president, the vice president,
[03:38:05.260 --> 03:38:11.260]  and certain designated high-level officials of that branch from engaging in some forms of political activity.
[03:38:11.260 --> 03:38:17.260]  So this is not ethical and it is corruption.
[03:38:17.260 --> 03:38:20.260]  But nothing happens to Julian Castro.
[03:38:20.260 --> 03:38:31.260]  It may have hurt his Veepstakes chances here because the last thing Hillary needs is another reminder of people how they sail past any laws
[03:38:31.260 --> 03:38:33.260]  and how the laws don't apply to them.
[03:38:33.260 --> 03:38:35.260]  What did he do, however?
[03:38:35.260 --> 03:38:40.260]  They say that he gave an interview and he had the seal of his department.
[03:38:40.260 --> 03:38:44.260]  The Housing and Urban Development Department was visible behind him as he gave the interview.
[03:38:44.260 --> 03:38:50.260]  This is reported by the Washington Post, hardly a right-wing, part of the vast right-wing conspiracy, as Hillary Clinton would say.
[03:38:50.260 --> 03:38:52.260]  No, this is the Washington Post.
[03:38:52.260 --> 03:39:00.260]  He answered questions from host Katie Couric for Yahoo News about his support for Hillary Clinton, including his chances as running mate.
[03:39:00.260 --> 03:39:01.260]  Okay?
[03:39:01.260 --> 03:39:07.260]  They say from the report, when Ms. Couric interviewed Secretary Castro, she introduced him as secretary.
[03:39:07.260 --> 03:39:09.260]  The official HUD seal appeared behind him.
[03:39:09.260 --> 03:39:13.260]  He spent the first seven minutes talking exclusively about HUD programs and initiatives.
[03:39:13.260 --> 03:39:18.260]  And as such, he gave the interview in his official capacity.
[03:39:18.260 --> 03:39:25.260]  And they say, although he stated during the interview that he was, quote, taking off my HUD hat for a second and just speaking individually, unquote,
[03:39:25.260 --> 03:39:34.260]  to indicate he was answering questions in his personal capacity, that disclaimer could not negate the fact that he was appearing in his official capacity for the rest of the interview.
[03:39:34.260 --> 03:39:44.260]  Because he advocated for and against presidential candidates, says the Office of Special Counsel, while appearing in his official capacity,
[03:39:44.260 --> 03:39:55.260]  Secretary Castro violated the Hatch-Ax prohibition against using one's official authority or influence to interfere with or to affect the result of an election.
[03:39:55.260 --> 03:39:56.260]  Okay?
[03:39:56.260 --> 03:39:59.260]  So this is something they did now.
[03:39:59.260 --> 03:40:02.260]  Obama has come out and said there will be no penalty for him.
[03:40:02.260 --> 03:40:06.260]  And quite frankly, the penalty for violating the Hatch Act is not that severe.
[03:40:06.260 --> 03:40:07.260]  There's no fines.
[03:40:07.260 --> 03:40:08.260]  There's no imprisonment.
[03:40:08.260 --> 03:40:11.260]  What would happen is you would lose your job.
[03:40:11.260 --> 03:40:13.260]  But of course, that's a big deal in Washington.
[03:40:13.260 --> 03:40:15.260]  Those are pretty cushy jobs.
[03:40:15.260 --> 03:40:18.260]  So I guess that's a pretty rough penalty if you lose that job.
[03:40:18.260 --> 03:40:25.260]  But White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said, well, to his credit, acknowledges that mistakes were made.
[03:40:25.260 --> 03:40:30.260]  Are we going to come after Josh Earnest for plagiarism?
[03:40:30.260 --> 03:40:36.260]  How many times have you heard that phrase when people are caught in a crime?
[03:40:36.260 --> 03:40:41.260]  Whether they're a politician or whether they're a glitterbug preacher, mistakes were made.
[03:40:41.260 --> 03:40:43.260]  Mistakes were made.
[03:40:43.260 --> 03:40:46.260]  That is okay.
[03:40:46.260 --> 03:40:50.260]  But of course, plagiarism, I'll remind you, is not a crime.
[03:40:50.260 --> 03:40:51.260]  Okay?
[03:40:51.260 --> 03:40:55.260]  You have to sue somebody if you think that it is something significant.
[03:40:55.260 --> 03:40:59.260]  If they copy it and put it in writing and make money off of it, okay?
[03:40:59.260 --> 03:41:01.260]  You can sue them for that.
[03:41:01.260 --> 03:41:09.260]  But plagiarism is not a crime, as I mentioned, unlike violating intentionally the security regulations as Secretary of State.
[03:41:09.260 --> 03:41:14.260]  So when we look at this, even though that is limited to the executive branch,
[03:41:14.260 --> 03:41:19.260]  consider what Ruth Bader Ginsburg did about a week and a half ago.
[03:41:19.260 --> 03:41:21.260]  Remember, she gave a couple of interviews.
[03:41:21.260 --> 03:41:23.260]  One of them she gave with the New York Times.
[03:41:23.260 --> 03:41:27.260]  And she said, I can't imagine what this place would be.
[03:41:27.260 --> 03:41:33.260]  I can't imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president, she told the New York Times.
[03:41:33.260 --> 03:41:35.260]  For the country, it could be four years.
[03:41:35.260 --> 03:41:38.260]  For the court, it could be, I don't even want to contemplate that.
[03:41:38.260 --> 03:41:47.260]  She also had an interview with the AP, where she assumed that Hillary Clinton would be nominated and would win the November election.
[03:41:47.260 --> 03:41:49.260]  Asked what would happen in that interview.
[03:41:49.260 --> 03:41:52.260]  If Trump won, she said, I don't even want to think about the possibility.
[03:41:52.260 --> 03:41:55.260]  But if it should be, then everything is up for grabs.
[03:41:55.260 --> 03:41:58.260]  So she gave a couple of high profile interviews.
[03:41:58.260 --> 03:42:03.260]  And this is, again, the Washington Post, not part of the vast right wing conspiracy.
[03:42:03.260 --> 03:42:07.260]  And they go out and they talk to law professors and they say, well, you know,
[03:42:07.260 --> 03:42:13.260]  she's had a history of being very blunt and outspoken and frank about things, like Scalia used to be.
[03:42:13.260 --> 03:42:17.260]  But they said, this is a bit beyond the pale.
[03:42:17.260 --> 03:42:21.260]  One guy who is Arthur Hellman, a law professor at University of Pittsburgh,
[03:42:21.260 --> 03:42:25.260]  says, I find it baffling, actually, that she said those things.
[03:42:25.260 --> 03:42:27.260]  She must know that she shouldn't.
[03:42:27.260 --> 03:42:30.260]  However tipped it she might be, she shouldn't be doing this.
[03:42:30.260 --> 03:42:40.260]  Another president of Ethics and Public Policy Center, Edward Whelan III, said that this was indefensible.
[03:42:40.260 --> 03:42:45.260]  He said, I think this exceeds all the other in terms of her indiscretions.
[03:42:45.260 --> 03:42:52.260]  I'm not aware of any justice ever expressing views on the merits or demerits of a presidential candidate in the midst of the campaign.
[03:42:52.260 --> 03:42:55.260]  I'm not a fan of Donald Trump's at all, he said.
[03:42:55.260 --> 03:43:04.260]  But the soundness or the unsoundness of her concerns about Donald Trump has no bearing on whether it was proper for her to say what she said.
[03:43:04.260 --> 03:43:06.260]  And a third one, I'll read you one more.
[03:43:06.260 --> 03:43:15.260]  Louis J. Varelai III, a Stetson University law professor, just wrote a book about Supreme Court recusals.
[03:43:15.260 --> 03:43:26.260]  We just had all these situations with Loretta Lynch refusing to recuse herself even though she owed her career and had been hired by Bill Clinton.
[03:43:26.260 --> 03:43:32.260]  Had a lot of economic ties to him, had a lot of political ties to him, had a lot of close family ties to him.
[03:43:32.260 --> 03:43:36.260]  But she would not recuse herself from the Clinton review.
[03:43:36.260 --> 03:43:44.260]  As a matter of fact, she meets with Bill Clinton privately, although flaunting it in public and in front of people on the plane, okay?
[03:43:44.260 --> 03:43:45.260]  Still would not recuse herself.
[03:43:45.260 --> 03:43:49.260]  So this guy just wrote a book on recusals.
[03:43:49.260 --> 03:43:59.260]  And he said, public comments like the one that Justice Ginsburg made could be seen as grounds for her to recuse herself from cases that might involve a future Trump administration.
[03:43:59.260 --> 03:44:04.260]  I don't necessarily think she would be required to do that, and I certainly don't believe that she would in every instance.
[03:44:04.260 --> 03:44:11.260]  But it could invite challenges to her impartiality based on her public comments, you think?
[03:44:11.260 --> 03:44:23.260]  So we have absolutely, look at the amount of coverage that's been given to what Ginsburg did, to what Castro did.
[03:44:23.260 --> 03:44:25.260]  Castro violated the Hatch Act.
[03:44:25.260 --> 03:44:28.260]  They dropped that bomb during the Republican Convention.
[03:44:28.260 --> 03:44:29.260]  Nobody talks about it.
[03:44:29.260 --> 03:44:30.260]  What were they talking about instead?
[03:44:30.260 --> 03:44:38.260]  They were talking about Melania Trump and the fact that she plagiarized some of Michelle Obama's speech, allegedly.
[03:44:38.260 --> 03:44:39.260]  Okay?
[03:44:39.260 --> 03:44:46.260]  And it's now been admitted by somebody today who came out from the Trump campaign and did a Mia Culpa, Meredith McIver, said,
[03:44:46.260 --> 03:44:51.260]  I'm the in-house staff writer at the Trump Organization, so forth and so on.
[03:44:51.260 --> 03:44:52.260]  You know what?
[03:44:52.260 --> 03:44:53.260]  I really could care less.
[03:44:53.260 --> 03:44:54.260]  Do you really care?
[03:44:54.260 --> 03:45:06.260]  If she took some boilerplate pablum and platitudes and plagiarized them from somebody else, I mean, Michelle Obama's speech meant nothing.
[03:45:06.260 --> 03:45:08.260]  And neither did Melania's.
[03:45:08.260 --> 03:45:17.260]  And why does that matter to us when what the Supreme Court justices doing here is showing us that they're nothing but a bunch of political hacks
[03:45:17.260 --> 03:45:23.260]  who can do whatever they wish and openly talk about the fact that they don't even care what the law says.
[03:45:23.260 --> 03:45:25.260]  They don't care what the Constitution says.
[03:45:25.260 --> 03:45:27.260]  They don't care what the law says.
[03:45:27.260 --> 03:45:30.260]  They are judicial activists.
[03:45:30.260 --> 03:45:34.260]  They rule in areas in which they have absolutely no authority.
[03:45:34.260 --> 03:45:40.260]  They refuse to follow any ethical guidelines as we see here with Ginsburg.
[03:45:40.260 --> 03:45:41.260]  Okay?
[03:45:41.260 --> 03:45:44.260]  And we had Donald Trump criticized her for that.
[03:45:44.260 --> 03:45:47.260]  He said it was highly inappropriate.
[03:45:47.260 --> 03:45:56.260]  He said, I think it's highly inappropriate, a U.S. Supreme Court justice sitting justice would get involved in a political campaign, frankly, he said.
[03:45:56.260 --> 03:45:59.260]  Trump also said, I think it's a disgrace to the court.
[03:45:59.260 --> 03:46:01.260]  I think she should apologize to the court.
[03:46:01.260 --> 03:46:02.260]  I couldn't believe it when I saw it.
[03:46:02.260 --> 03:46:04.260]  She eventually did apologize to the court.
[03:46:04.260 --> 03:46:06.260]  He said that she should be saying that.
[03:46:06.260 --> 03:46:09.260]  He's so beneath the court for her to be making statements like that.
[03:46:09.260 --> 03:46:11.260]  It only energizes my base even more.
[03:46:11.260 --> 03:46:15.260]  And I would hope that she would get off the court as soon as possible.
[03:46:15.260 --> 03:46:17.260]  Yeah, if she had any integrity, she would resign.
[03:46:17.260 --> 03:46:31.260]  She would essentially apply the ethics principles of the Hatch Act, which although that applies specifically to the executive branch and not to the Supreme Court, because they can do anything they want.
[03:46:31.260 --> 03:46:33.260]  That's one of the key things we need to understand.
[03:46:33.260 --> 03:46:41.260]  You're going to hear Ted Cruz tonight talking so much about Supreme Court justices and how important it is for us to get conservative Supreme Court justices.
[03:46:41.260 --> 03:46:46.260]  We need to rethink the scope of the Supreme Court.
[03:46:46.260 --> 03:46:56.260]  We need to rethink the authority that they gave themselves with Marbury versus Madison, saying we will have the final say on all things about the Constitution.
[03:46:56.260 --> 03:47:08.260]  And now they've gone into becoming judicial activists because they like gay marriage, even though the federal government and the Supreme Court has nothing in the Constitution that says that they have any authority to define marriage one way or the other.
[03:47:08.260 --> 03:47:13.260]  They say, well, we're going to say that it's now a federal, make a federal case out of it.
[03:47:13.260 --> 03:47:19.260]  And we're going to rule the way we want to because they view the Constitution as a living document.
[03:47:19.260 --> 03:47:23.260]  They don't care how it was written. They don't care what it meant.
[03:47:23.260 --> 03:47:25.260]  They're not there to be legal referees.
[03:47:25.260 --> 03:47:30.260]  They are nine political appointees appointed for life.
[03:47:30.260 --> 03:47:34.260]  And we haven't had a very good track record on the conservative side.
[03:47:34.260 --> 03:47:41.260]  We have gotten reliable liberal status from the people who have been appointed by the Democrats.
[03:47:41.260 --> 03:47:47.260]  But it's been a real mixed bag from Ronald Reagan and everybody else in terms of conservative judges.
[03:47:47.260 --> 03:47:49.260]  But I just want to add one more thing to this.
[03:47:49.260 --> 03:48:08.260]  And that is, think about the back and forth, the hue and cry and the outrage when Donald Trump said that he thought a district judge who was reviewing a court case of his had a conflict of interest because this judge is a La Raza lawyer.
[03:48:08.260 --> 03:48:10.260]  It takes us right back to the castros again, doesn't it?
[03:48:10.260 --> 03:48:20.260]  This guy is a La Raza lawyer. He is part of a racist Hispanic organization that is there to promote a specific group.
[03:48:20.260 --> 03:48:29.260]  Not help lawyers in general, but only Hispanic lawyers to say that for the race, everything outside of the race, nothing.
[03:48:29.260 --> 03:48:35.260]  How racist can you get? You can't get any more racist than the race, La Raza.
[03:48:35.260 --> 03:48:41.260]  And here we have this judge who doesn't just have a Mexican heritage, okay?
[03:48:41.260 --> 03:48:48.260]  It's not just his Mexican heritage. It's the fact and that's really, I think, where Donald Trump lost it there.
[03:48:48.260 --> 03:48:52.260]  He wasn't specific enough. He just talked in general terms of his Mexican heritage.
[03:48:52.260 --> 03:48:59.260]  His Mexican heritage means everything to this guy to the point that he's gone off the rails to becoming a racist.
[03:48:59.260 --> 03:49:08.260]  And yet, we've thought about that, heard about that for weeks. Yet, you can have ethical violations from the sitting Supreme Court justice.
[03:49:08.260 --> 03:49:17.260]  You can have hatch-axe violations from one of the twin sons of one of the founders of La Raza. Nobody pays any attention to it.
[03:49:17.260 --> 03:49:20.260]  What an amazing, amazing double standard.
[03:49:20.260 --> 03:49:24.260]  Meanwhile, one more piece of Hillary Clinton news here.
[03:49:24.260 --> 03:49:29.260]  She said to be looking as they look forward to who she's going to pick.
[03:49:29.260 --> 03:49:36.260]  And she has said that she will be announcing who she's going to be picking for Vice President this Friday.
[03:49:36.260 --> 03:49:42.260]  The Democrat Convention begins next Monday. InfoWars will be there. I'll be there at the Democrat Convention.
[03:49:42.260 --> 03:49:48.260]  They say that she is seeking national security experience for Vice Presidential pick.
[03:49:48.260 --> 03:49:53.260]  That's not a joke headline, folks. That's for real.
[03:49:53.260 --> 03:49:57.260]  Yes, she does need some help for national security.
[03:49:57.260 --> 03:50:01.260]  First of all, she needs to understand that it's important.
[03:50:01.260 --> 03:50:06.260]  But this is, I guess, part of her narrative to say, you know, I just really didn't know.
[03:50:06.260 --> 03:50:10.260]  You know, when you say server, do you mean when you say wiping my server?
[03:50:10.260 --> 03:50:14.260]  You mean like with a cloth or something? I'm just a little grandmother, you know?
[03:50:14.260 --> 03:50:17.260]  I wear these Chairman Mao suits. Just call me grandmau.
[03:50:17.260 --> 03:50:22.260]  I don't really know anything about servers and private networks and all this stuff.
[03:50:22.260 --> 03:50:28.260]  So maybe I'll look at somebody who's a four-star Navy admiral who can help me with that.
[03:50:28.260 --> 03:50:33.260]  Also, Tim Kaine, a former Virginia governor who is now a senator is there.
[03:50:33.260 --> 03:50:38.260]  They're talking about still Elizabeth Warren. Someone else mentions Tim Kaine.
[03:50:38.260 --> 03:50:43.260]  He is the one that seems to come up. His name seems to come up in every one of these discussions.
[03:50:43.260 --> 03:50:50.260]  Meanwhile, there's a lot of top Democrat Senate hopefuls, people who are in a tough election.
[03:50:50.260 --> 03:50:53.260]  They're going to be skipping the convention with Hillary Clinton.
[03:50:53.260 --> 03:50:56.260]  You don't hear them talking about that much, do you, either?
[03:50:56.260 --> 03:51:00.260]  Okay, say with us. We're going to be right back. We're going to talk about what's up tonight at the Republican convention.
[03:51:00.260 --> 03:51:07.260]  My name is Don Whiskin, and at 42 years old, I suffered a massive heart attack, lost 35% of my heart to damaged tissue,
[03:51:07.260 --> 03:51:10.260]  and was supposed to spend the rest of my life on disability.
[03:51:10.260 --> 03:51:19.260]  What did I do? I took Extendivite, a garlic and cayenne mix of seven herbs which rebuilt my heart and gave me back my life.
[03:51:19.260 --> 03:51:27.260]  For over 17 years now, I have made this formula available to you, so you don't have to suffer the same thing I did.
[03:51:27.260 --> 03:51:32.260]  Clean your blocked arteries and strengthen your heart and boost your natural immune system.
[03:51:32.260 --> 03:51:36.260]  I'm 60 years old now, and I still work every day.
[03:51:36.260 --> 03:51:49.260]  To get your Extendivite, call 1-877-928-8822 or visit heartdrop.com.
[03:51:49.260 --> 03:51:54.260]  Extendivite is only $69.95 for a two-month supply of either capsules or liquid.
[03:51:54.260 --> 03:52:20.260]  Extend your life with Extendivite.
[03:52:20.260 --> 03:52:26.260]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the Info War at the same time.
[03:52:26.260 --> 03:52:30.260]  I'm a nine-year listener. I buy all the nutraceuticals, nitrofx, nascent iodine.
[03:52:30.260 --> 03:52:32.260]  Why? God, let me ask you a question. Have they worked for you?
[03:52:32.260 --> 03:52:35.260]  They're one of the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[03:52:35.260 --> 03:52:36.260]  What products are you taking?
[03:52:36.260 --> 03:52:44.260]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to Wintersun, X2, even got a little DNA force.
[03:52:44.260 --> 03:52:48.260]  So when I just re-upped everything and I just went to Autofill.

[03:55:28.260 --> 03:55:32.260]  Maybe that would work for him. Well, that didn't work for Jeb either, did it?
[03:55:32.260 --> 03:55:34.260]  Okay, let me tell you something.
[03:55:34.260 --> 03:55:38.260]  He's just a guy who has sold out libertarian principles.
[03:55:38.260 --> 03:55:41.260]  He is nothing but a political whore.
[03:55:41.260 --> 03:55:50.260]  When I look at this, the libertarian party has just become another player for big business, globalist, multinational corporations.
[03:55:50.260 --> 03:55:55.260]  They don't even support the principles of private property in the Second Amendment anymore.
[03:55:55.260 --> 03:56:00.260]  They sold out on that. These two guys, these two former governors that are there.
[03:56:00.260 --> 03:56:02.260]  And then tonight we've got Ted Cruz.
[03:56:02.260 --> 03:56:10.260]  And as AP points out, no sign of a Trump endorsement, but plenty of Cruz's ambition will be on display tonight when Ted Cruz gives his speech.
[03:56:10.260 --> 03:56:13.260]  He's not going to explicitly endorse Donald Trump.
[03:56:13.260 --> 03:56:16.260]  He is looking towards 2020.
[03:56:16.260 --> 03:56:19.260]  But I don't think he can see that far.
[03:56:19.260 --> 03:56:22.260]  I think Ted Cruz has got kind of foggy vision.
[03:56:22.260 --> 03:56:24.260]  It's not 2020, folks.
[03:56:24.260 --> 03:56:34.260]  If you think for a minute Cruz people, Ted Cruz especially, that by putting Hillary Clinton in, you're going to get a shot in just four years.
[03:56:34.260 --> 03:56:36.260]  You should have another thing coming.
[03:56:36.260 --> 03:56:43.260]  I don't think you can see that clearly because Hillary Clinton, the kind of person she is, she is so incredibly corrupt.
[03:56:43.260 --> 03:56:47.260]  She's going to consolidate power to such a degree that you'll never get her out of midterm.
[03:56:47.260 --> 03:56:53.260]  It's going to be at least eight years of Hillary Clinton and then a hand-picked successor after that.
[03:56:53.260 --> 03:57:07.260]  When we look at what's going on, I got to say that Trump is amazingly and maybe foolishly magnanimous in allowing this ambitious troll to speak tonight.
[03:57:07.260 --> 03:57:12.260]  I guess he didn't want to look as bad as the GOP establishment did when Romney shut down.
[03:57:12.260 --> 03:57:17.260]  Ron Paul went to a great deal of trouble to do that in the rules committee to shut him down.
[03:57:17.260 --> 03:57:21.260]  But it's not going to be appreciated by these people, by these never Trumpers.
[03:57:21.260 --> 03:57:27.260]  You know, we watched the histrionics and the temper tantrums that were being done on the floor.
[03:57:27.260 --> 03:57:31.260]  They reached out many times to all of these people at the head of the never Trump movement.
[03:57:31.260 --> 03:57:33.260]  They would not return calls, conversations.
[03:57:33.260 --> 03:57:42.260]  They didn't want to have a conversation about this except to go on to MSNBC, where they will be welcomed as an opponent of Donald Trump.
[03:57:42.260 --> 03:57:48.260]  They don't want to talk about the fact. They wanted to steal the votes of the people who voted in the elections.
[03:57:48.260 --> 03:57:51.260]  I mean, this is nothing but racketeering and fraud, folks.
[03:57:51.260 --> 03:58:04.260]  And it was amazing irony to me that these people would whine and complain because they weren't able to twist and change the rules at this convention like they did at the state conventions.
[03:58:04.260 --> 03:58:11.260]  You know, the never Trumpers really need to go back to their never, never land because they won't grow up just like Peter Pan.
[03:58:11.260 --> 03:58:15.260]  Alright, we're going to be covering more of the Republican National Convention tonight.
