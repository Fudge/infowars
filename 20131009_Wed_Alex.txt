[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:36.720]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.720 --> 00:43.200]  we're live my friends I literally just jumped in my chair seconds ago busy
[00:43.200 --> 00:46.760]  working on news developments during the break Stewart Rhodes the founder of
[00:46.760 --> 00:51.080]  Oathkeepers with a lot of key breaking analysis and news is going to join us at
[00:51.080 --> 00:55.920]  the bottom of the next hour into the bottom of the next hour so the bottom
[00:55.920 --> 01:02.160]  of the second hour and to the bottom of the third hour and then Tosh Plumlee now
[01:02.160 --> 01:07.280]  being contacted by the Department of Defense for his radio interviews here is
[01:07.280 --> 01:15.560]  going to be joining us of course he has these sources in NATO and DOD as well as
[01:15.560 --> 01:19.920]  the DEA on what really happened in Benghazi and I don't just believe Tosh
[01:19.920 --> 01:24.400]  Plumlee congressional whistleblower he's famous for the church hearings and then
[01:24.400 --> 01:28.200]  Iran Contra I don't just believe him I separately from all my sources have
[01:28.200 --> 01:31.880]  confirmed what he's saying but it's a whole nother level now when the DOD is
[01:31.880 --> 01:35.960]  contacting him and trying to censor his Facebook and things and they want to know
[01:35.960 --> 01:42.720]  they're telling who told you this talk about treason the entire DOD anybody
[01:42.720 --> 01:48.240]  who's got a secret clearance in the areas of the Middle East or especially top
[01:48.240 --> 01:52.360]  secret knows exactly what happened that were predator drones overhead seven and
[01:52.360 --> 01:58.160]  a half hours stand down the execution of the ambassador the help being blocked
[01:58.160 --> 02:03.920]  and I'm telling you this is a big deal I mean obviously I don't have to tell you
[02:03.920 --> 02:09.640]  that you know that it's just that it it hits me what a crazy world we're living
[02:09.640 --> 02:14.920]  in a really crazy world so that's Julie Wilson's article former CIA whistleblower
[02:14.920 --> 02:22.000]  targeted by government for Facebook post she put that out Monday night and then
[02:22.000 --> 02:25.080]  we got a hold of Tosh yesterday and got him coming on the show for about 10
[02:25.080 --> 02:29.640]  minutes just to give us an update at the bottom of the last hour that said I
[02:29.640 --> 02:32.760]  just have one of those double-take moments right as I got in here to cover
[02:32.760 --> 02:40.760]  the news where the the fraud the wall of corruption and deception and outright
[02:40.760 --> 02:48.400]  lies is so mega massive that I'm really having trouble even forming words at
[02:48.400 --> 02:53.480]  this point obviously we're going to get into the maneuvering of the United
[02:53.480 --> 02:59.040]  States down the road into a default and into a pure beggar nation to the offshore
[02:59.040 --> 03:02.960]  banking cartels that have been maneuvering us towards the rocks the
[03:02.960 --> 03:08.320]  entire time on record when I first woke up 20 years ago this is what all of the
[03:08.320 --> 03:12.600]  patriots were saying and documenting this is what they wrote about in 1972
[03:12.600 --> 03:21.880]  before I was born in Nundair call a conspiracy by Gary Allen can't believe
[03:21.880 --> 03:28.320]  Gary Allen's son runs Politico and puts out all that anti-liberty disinfo it'd
[03:28.320 --> 03:33.640]  be like if my son grew up and joined the dark side I just Gary Allen is such a
[03:33.640 --> 03:38.240]  legend for what he did with Nundair call a conspiracy it's gonna be like 10
[03:38.240 --> 03:43.440]  million copies out in print we would have lost by now it wasn't for that book
[03:43.440 --> 03:46.160]  I mean I'm just gonna tell you right now and he never knew right in that book that
[03:46.160 --> 03:49.840]  that would happen and then it would have woken up tens of millions of people we
[03:49.840 --> 03:53.680]  sell the book by the way at m4store.com not really a plug but it's there if you
[03:53.680 --> 04:01.480]  want it and everything came true in that book 90% of it I mean we're 90% there
[04:01.480 --> 04:04.320]  and if the book hadn't been there and other the John Birch society other
[04:04.320 --> 04:07.880]  people we would already be completely down the rat hole of heartable conscious
[04:07.880 --> 04:12.760]  authoritarians who want to wreck society and make us poor so they can control us
[04:12.760 --> 04:18.240]  and I just I'm beyond angry about that when I see poverty and I see dumb down
[04:18.240 --> 04:23.040]  people and I see all the problems happening humans have problems naturally
[04:23.040 --> 04:27.680]  anyways but to have the system trying to make things as bad as possible and then
[04:27.680 --> 04:31.920]  running businesses over all the problems to like capitalize on it problem
[04:31.920 --> 04:36.920]  reaction solution just makes me sick I can't even listen to Obama's voice now
[04:36.920 --> 04:42.360]  or look at him and I know he's a puppet but he he symbolizes everything and he's
[04:42.360 --> 04:45.320]  the ass end of the New World Order crapping all over us and I'm just sick
[04:45.320 --> 04:48.720]  of it excuse me talking like that there's no other word to describe it I
[04:48.720 --> 04:53.400]  mean I just if there was another country quasi-free I could run to I would get
[04:53.400 --> 04:56.760]  out of here and write my promise not abandon ship I tell you it's world

[09:29.920 --> 09:34.560]  drudge can put things like nobody else so simply yelling to run the world that's
[09:34.560 --> 09:40.640]  the headline the new Fed chief after the genius Larry Summers who helped engineer
[09:40.640 --> 09:45.960]  the collapse the end of Glass-Steagall the derivative scam that they were so
[09:45.960 --> 09:49.120]  arrogant they tried to run him like they wanted Kissinger the white washer
[09:49.120 --> 09:53.000]  over the 9-11 Commission when he was involved in 9-11 clearly well now
[09:53.000 --> 09:56.760]  they've removed him and it's a woman so if you're against hyperinflation why
[09:56.760 --> 10:03.520]  Mar Republic well then you're you're obviously a anti-woman I mean you're
[10:03.520 --> 10:07.680]  obviously a racist you're obviously not trendy but it actually says rejoice look
[10:07.680 --> 10:13.560]  at the headline rejoice the yelling Fed will print money forever to create jobs
[10:13.560 --> 10:18.720]  that's a quote ladies and gentlemen that's out of the telegraph rejoice
[10:18.720 --> 10:22.600]  they're going to just accelerate the printing presses and give the money
[10:22.600 --> 10:27.160]  first to the insiders so they get first use of it and then hand us all of the
[10:27.160 --> 10:30.960]  devalued currencies and the hyperinflation but don't worry they've
[10:30.960 --> 10:37.160]  got a plan oh yes this lovely lady she's got a plan she was gonna meet with the
[10:37.160 --> 10:43.000]  boys in the band to continue quoting the song she's got a plan the same plan
[10:43.000 --> 10:45.920]  the new orders always had they've done in hundreds of countries in the last
[10:45.920 --> 10:51.400]  century sometimes every few decades like in Mexico and Brazil and Nigeria over
[10:51.400 --> 10:54.720]  and over and over again they get you into artificial debt sign you on to
[10:54.720 --> 11:00.120]  derivatives bring in Western IMF World Bank money that's then paid back to IMF
[11:00.120 --> 11:03.440]  World Bank controlling interest never hitting the people of the country and
[11:03.440 --> 11:06.680]  then the nation goes deeper into deeper in debt and then they can bring in
[11:06.680 --> 11:12.360]  social engineering for more financing more fiat money that they just pull out
[11:12.360 --> 11:15.880]  of their hat actually pull it out of somewhere else they pull it out of our
[11:15.880 --> 11:24.400]  future so they say rejoice rejoice but it's important and they say this that
[11:24.400 --> 11:28.680]  they want to depress the economy while they hyperinflate so you get hyper
[11:28.680 --> 11:32.480]  stag inflation a term I coined about six years ago the top economists have
[11:32.480 --> 11:35.920]  agreed is a good name for it Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is it that's a good term
[11:35.920 --> 11:40.440]  for it and it is hyper stag inflation not not stagflation they said was
[11:40.440 --> 11:43.560]  impossible until the 70s because it's totally artificial even under the
[11:43.560 --> 11:51.880]  Keynesian model but hyper stag inflation rape flation fraud flation total
[11:51.880 --> 11:58.200]  upside down two plus two common core equals five inflation by the way you
[11:58.200 --> 12:00.840]  saw that under federal funding and Arkansas they're teaching kids the
[12:00.840 --> 12:05.200]  Constitution's bad and they have them to practice rewriting it for the NDA and
[12:05.200 --> 12:10.720]  Homeland Security and the Patriot Act it actually says that well we thought we
[12:10.720 --> 12:16.240]  would really take the nanny state to the next level my dad had an idea and then I
[12:16.240 --> 12:21.760]  kind of augmented it a bit and we're going to tell you about it the ultimate
[12:21.760 --> 12:26.800]  in the nanny state right here in Austin Texas a enclave of trendiness and
[12:26.800 --> 12:33.800]  mental illness and low IQs we go to the trendy enclaves and there's nothing they
[12:33.800 --> 12:41.400]  won't sign we have actually topped mark dice and the California idiots we now
[12:41.400 --> 12:49.000]  ladies and gentlemen have found 14 out of 20 people 14 out of 20 people they
[12:49.000 --> 12:55.560]  talked to doesn't take long to do this have now signed a petition well I'm
[12:55.560 --> 13:01.280]  gonna have to tell you when we air it when we premiere it in T minus 57
[13:01.280 --> 13:08.120]  minutes we come in at the eight after next hour and that's second segment when
[13:08.120 --> 13:14.080]  we come in there were a lot of stations join us we're going to premiere the
[13:14.080 --> 13:20.520]  ultimate nanny state dream by the way it's now moved into archive featured
[13:20.520 --> 13:24.560]  archive for people can click top stories and it's it's there at m4s.com
[13:24.560 --> 13:27.960]  and principle.com will you print me a Don Salazar's article that went out last
[13:27.960 --> 13:31.680]  night it works so hard sometimes like eight at night but then the problem is
[13:31.680 --> 13:35.700]  it goes out then and nobody reads it about how Spain is moving to tax the
[13:35.700 --> 13:39.160]  Sun and I told people the E was already having hearings three years ago to tax
[13:39.160 --> 13:43.640]  the Sun so they're just adopting there to Spain considers taxing the Sun well
[13:43.640 --> 13:49.360]  they're not considering it they're moving to do it but how solar panels
[13:49.360 --> 13:56.080]  became toxic assets and that's the answer massive taxes on anybody that's
[13:56.080 --> 14:00.800]  independent take here in central Texas under the trendy rule of the
[14:00.800 --> 14:08.920]  authoritarian hipsters they will harass you and go after you and and fight you
[14:08.920 --> 14:12.520]  if you try to put your own off the grid solar panels in it's not a problem in
[14:12.520 --> 14:15.940]  Hays County or other counties that aren't in the Travis County new world order
[14:15.940 --> 14:20.760]  controlled G21 zone on record but they basically won't permit you to have your
[14:20.760 --> 14:23.880]  own solar panels you've got to have them the type they want with kickbacks to
[14:23.880 --> 14:26.880]  their insider friends you got to buy from certain companies and then it's got
[14:26.880 --> 14:31.560]  to be hooked in the power grid you got to be hooked in to the matrix by the way
[14:31.560 --> 14:35.240]  the head of Google Schmidt has come out and said you know Google glasses are the
[14:35.240 --> 14:38.760]  next stage towards implanting stuff in your brain but that's a little creepy
[14:38.760 --> 14:42.240]  right now we're trying to develop less invasive technology but that's coming
[14:42.240 --> 14:50.800]  and as long as you have a vogue photo shoot showing some trendies you know men
[14:50.800 --> 14:56.440]  with big handlebar mustaches on on on leashes with trendy women controlling
[14:56.440 --> 15:01.120]  them that's the new trendy thing as long as as long as that's the case I mean
[15:01.120 --> 15:07.640]  they will take the brain ship so nothing against folks with handlebar
[15:07.640 --> 15:10.640]  mustaches but I mean my whole thing is I read an article about all over the
[15:10.640 --> 15:13.720]  country they're electing hipsters as mayors just as long as you have a
[15:13.720 --> 15:17.600]  handlebar mustache and where two different color socks and and waddle
[15:17.600 --> 15:23.120]  around you're gonna have supermodels on both arms if you can't talk because
[15:23.120 --> 15:26.600]  they've taught women that you're successful if you have a guy who can't
[15:26.600 --> 15:30.680]  talk but actually trendy and then of course really the women aren't
[15:30.680 --> 15:34.040]  successful and it doesn't fulfill them but it doesn't matter by then they're
[15:34.040 --> 15:37.400]  already wrecked and they think well I've missed him more trendy and do more of
[15:37.400 --> 15:42.600]  what the trendy say then I'll be fulfilled and then of course your life
[15:42.600 --> 15:46.080]  just gets worse and worse and worse you would be fulfilled when you became red
[15:46.080 --> 15:54.000]  blooded and primitive again that's when you'll become fulfilled when you go and
[15:54.000 --> 15:57.360]  run around on the woods at night foaming at the mouth I'm joking the point is is
[15:57.360 --> 16:00.960]  that that's what's going to fulfill you is getting back to your instincts getting
[16:00.960 --> 16:05.120]  back to your humanity getting back to the fulfillment of not being afraid if
[16:05.120 --> 16:09.440]  you buy into the popular culture you might as well stick a shotgun your mouth
[16:09.440 --> 16:12.840]  and pull the trigger in slow motion because that's psychologically
[16:12.840 --> 16:19.200]  spiritually intellectually culturally what you're doing to yourself and I'm
[16:19.200 --> 16:22.920]  sorry it's just that I'm realizing I've got to declare war on establishment
[16:22.920 --> 16:26.120]  trendiness do you know what establishment
[16:26.120 --> 16:29.320]  trendiness is I'll use an example of this I've used many times but then
[16:29.320 --> 16:35.080]  elaborate on it in every culture whether it was the Aztecs or whether it was the
[16:35.080 --> 16:39.280]  ancient Chinese or whether it was the ancient Babylonians or whether it was
[16:39.280 --> 16:44.920]  even the ancient Romans technocrats manipulators con artists emperors new
[16:44.920 --> 16:50.840]  clothes type operators would come in and say listen you're the emperor of China
[16:50.840 --> 16:53.800]  you can't be seen by the public you're too important you have a little behind
[16:53.800 --> 16:56.960]  this walled city and by the way you can't feed yourself you've got to have
[16:56.960 --> 17:00.600]  footlong fingernails because that shows you're totally elitist and we're going
[17:00.600 --> 17:05.480]  to worship you as God by the way your women shouldn't be able to walk they need
[17:05.480 --> 17:08.400]  to be carried to make sure they don't walk by the way it'll get them off your
[17:08.400 --> 17:11.840]  back emperor we're going to bind their feet at birth so they can't even walk
[17:11.840 --> 17:16.080]  and then later how about we teach your women to not be able to talk and just
[17:16.080 --> 17:20.520]  keep them locked up the pit because that's what elitist do and under styled
[17:20.520 --> 17:25.520]  women couldn't walk the men couldn't walk half the time they had you know foot
[17:25.520 --> 17:29.720]  long two foot long fingernails and were just mental patients from birth back
[17:29.720 --> 17:34.320]  there convinced they were God with the power behind the throne the the imperial
[17:34.320 --> 17:39.480]  class bowing to them and in like you know like bees visiting the queen bee in
[17:39.480 --> 17:43.680]  her chamber but literally laughing at them behind the scenes running giant
[17:43.680 --> 17:48.400]  armies and takeover operations and building huge walls and siege machines
[17:48.400 --> 17:52.600]  and creating bio weapon programs against their enemies the Chinese first did
[17:52.600 --> 17:58.040]  that everything else very high level of science and they wrote books talking
[17:58.040 --> 18:01.280]  about how ridiculous the emperors were and how they controlled them and how
[18:01.280 --> 18:05.320]  how you how you needed to continue to control future imperial dynasties and
[18:05.320 --> 18:08.640]  then the power behind the throne became the real emperors and then they would
[18:08.640 --> 18:13.200]  hereditarily hand down the power I mean the parallel would be the stewards of
[18:13.200 --> 18:18.360]  gondor in the Lord of the Rings trilogy who actually become the king and say I
[18:18.360 --> 18:25.040]  don't want the kingdom occurred I am in control now take me to the tower and
[18:25.040 --> 18:29.800]  burn me with my sons I mean that's the type of stuff we're dealing with here
[18:29.800 --> 18:35.640]  and that's what trendiness and fashion and all the rest of it is if you like a
[18:35.640 --> 18:41.720]  fashion go with it if you like it if you're into something that's fine if you
[18:41.720 --> 18:44.680]  like tattoos all over your body great if you like handlebar mustaches that's
[18:44.680 --> 18:51.000]  great the point is is that people literally at least where I live are just
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.280]  everywhere and and and I tell them I go go to areas we see handlebar mustaches
[18:55.280 --> 18:59.080]  and women in charge and they will sign anything you can go up to them and say
[18:59.080 --> 19:01.920]  we want to kill all conservatives they signed the thing we want to put all
[19:01.920 --> 19:05.560]  gun owners at FEMA camps they signed the thing today we went to him or yesterday
[19:05.560 --> 19:10.960]  we went to him we're gonna air today and and and it's unbelievable ladies and
[19:10.960 --> 19:18.640]  gentlemen we have the holy grail of trendy idiocy and we have an endless
[19:18.640 --> 19:22.800]  mind of them that we can go visit with and listen when you start talking to
[19:22.800 --> 19:27.200]  these people they don't know what planet they're on you understand that they
[19:27.200 --> 19:30.200]  have no job when they get out of college they almost I'm already out of
[19:30.200 --> 19:34.480]  college you know working at the gas station nothing against that but the
[19:34.480 --> 19:38.760]  point is so because they're failing they're buying more into whatever the
[19:38.760 --> 19:42.200]  trendy culture says and they think the trendy culture is counterculture and
[19:42.200 --> 19:46.760]  I'm telling you folks I'm telling you these people are the most servile

[25:22.360 --> 25:26.440]  is and I shouldn't be celebrating the ignorance of trendies and Obama
[25:26.440 --> 25:33.160]  supporters but as a mass of kleptocrats they work to enslave
[25:33.160 --> 25:36.680]  everyone including themselves because it makes them feel powerful in their feeble
[25:36.680 --> 25:41.000]  little brains through the structure so I should be crying over the video we're

[25:45.320 --> 25:49.400]  why I'm laughing is it's it's it's gallows humor because it freaks me out
[25:49.400 --> 25:52.840]  that I knew when we sent our reporters on the street this would happen but let's
[25:52.840 --> 25:57.160]  shift gears on the really serious issues until then here is the one telegraph
[25:57.160 --> 26:03.560]  headline rejoice the yelling fed will print money forever to create jobs
[26:03.560 --> 26:06.920]  we don't need any stinking factories we don't need any stinking service
[26:06.920 --> 26:10.520]  we just print money how's that working out with the average person out there
[26:10.520 --> 26:14.040]  well it works out good for the banksters the banksteristas
[26:14.040 --> 26:18.280]  the terroristas we now know where we stand Janet
[26:18.280 --> 26:23.640]  Yellen is to take over the US Federal Reserve which is not federal just
[26:23.640 --> 26:28.440]  everything's a fraud foreign bank the world's monetary hegemon the
[26:28.440 --> 26:32.760]  master of all our lives just in our face there it is
[26:32.760 --> 26:36.440]  aren't we all just slaves the central bankers the cmbc says
[26:36.440 --> 26:40.600]  the answer is yes they know best the fed will be
[26:40.600 --> 26:47.320]  looser or longer that's right with our credit in our future the fomc will
[26:47.320 --> 26:50.920]  continue to print money until the u.s economy creates enough
[26:50.920 --> 26:55.720]  jobs to reignite wage pressures and inflation regardless of asset
[26:55.720 --> 26:59.240]  bubbles or collateral damage along the way
[26:59.240 --> 27:03.560]  no fed chief in history has ever been better qualified
[27:03.560 --> 27:08.120]  she is a glaring contrast allen greenspan a political speech writer for
[27:08.120 --> 27:11.400]  Richard nixon who never earned a real phd it was
[27:11.400 --> 27:16.280]  honorary or pens an economic paper of depth she has
[27:16.280 --> 27:20.040]  pedigree her husband is noble laureate george

[27:43.080 --> 27:50.040]  of clinton's council of economic advisors when she headed asia crisis
[27:50.040 --> 27:53.640]  you could hardly find a safer pair of hands and they just go on with the
[27:53.640 --> 27:57.880]  sarcastic uh piece i think that right now the question
[27:57.880 --> 28:01.720]  is do we all work for central bankers that's what i want to address to our
[28:01.720 --> 28:05.160]  guest tonight is this global governance at last
[28:05.160 --> 28:08.040]  is it one world the central bankers in charge dem
[28:08.040 --> 28:13.240]  gemioreo you say we've got some downside here a correction in the market's fine
[28:13.240 --> 28:17.480]  but aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do aren't we
[28:17.480 --> 28:20.600]  all just counting on the facts enough to burn and keep
[28:20.600 --> 28:24.360]  and and this is life under them where they engineered the economic system
[28:24.360 --> 28:28.040]  they created the derivatives they're shutting the economy down they're shutting
[28:28.040 --> 28:31.240]  the power plants down they're controlling china that has all
[28:31.240 --> 28:34.680]  these hidden tariffs against us as we compete with the slave trade they are
[28:34.680 --> 28:37.880]  engineering the collapse and their own white papers admitting it
[28:37.880 --> 28:41.000]  not just clowered and piven but dozens of them
[28:41.000 --> 28:44.520]  kassunstein admits that they're waging war against the people and trying to
[28:44.520 --> 28:48.120]  divide and conquer us and that msnbc is there to create racial
[28:48.120 --> 28:50.680]  division i mean that's how dumb they think you are

[29:06.520 --> 29:10.600]  and that it's racist to say so and that world government doesn't exist
[29:10.600 --> 29:14.440]  as they announce world government it's a cult

[33:51.160 --> 33:56.360]  i have power by the way you notice that at national parks like
[33:56.360 --> 34:00.040]  yellowstone and others they they come up with guns drawn
[34:00.040 --> 34:03.720]  and and pull people off tour buses that drive in foreigners freak out and think
[34:03.720 --> 34:06.440]  they're in nazi germany the papers are reporting
[34:06.440 --> 34:10.840]  they go into hotels announcing lockdown and say you're not allowed to leave
[34:10.840 --> 34:15.560]  you can either still pay for your stay even though you paid into the park and
[34:15.560 --> 34:19.640]  paid your hotel or you can stay in the building but you're not allowed to even
[34:19.640 --> 34:23.400]  get off the bus and take photographs you're not allowed to park on the side
[34:23.400 --> 34:26.440]  of the road outside mount rushmore and take photos
[34:26.440 --> 34:31.400]  uh we are in charge now and this happens everywhere you go to the
[34:31.400 --> 34:34.280]  any national seashore they will march up to you get in your
[34:34.280 --> 34:37.400]  face over and over again and look at you with total hatred
[34:37.400 --> 34:43.480]  it's happened to me personally unbelievable
[34:43.480 --> 34:47.320]  happened to me when i was in big bend earlier this year man it's so beautiful
[34:47.320 --> 34:50.520]  there in the winter i could live there it was just
[34:50.520 --> 34:54.520]  awesome no cell phone reception no nothing i had to go to the very top of a
[34:54.520 --> 34:56.920]  mountain to be able to upload youtube videos
[34:56.920 --> 34:59.880]  have to hike up to the top of a mountain spend hours up there uploading videos
[34:59.880 --> 35:03.800]  that shot uh for the few days i've been there and
[35:03.800 --> 35:08.280]  i would do stuff like be driving down the road and see a park ranger standing by
[35:08.280 --> 35:11.800]  an armed park ranger standing by their vehicle and i would as a test i'd say
[35:11.800 --> 35:14.840]  okay let's wave and smile and the guy would just sit
[35:14.840 --> 35:19.560]  there bugging his eyes out literally just with pure rage
[35:19.560 --> 35:23.480]  and then i ran into other people who were at these natural hot springs around
[35:23.480 --> 35:27.240]  the border and they they were talking about that very guy
[35:27.240 --> 35:30.840]  and how they'd asked him for directions and he'd been rude to them
[35:30.840 --> 35:34.360]  i mean it's just crazy just crazed people in uniforms
[35:34.360 --> 35:38.360]  running around you watch old movies with eril flinn
[35:38.360 --> 35:42.360]  like robin hood that's actually based on a true story loosely
[35:42.360 --> 35:45.320]  and you wonder how they could come shake everybody down how they could be so
[35:45.320 --> 35:48.760]  abusive and how they could rape people's daughters and how they could
[35:48.760 --> 35:51.960]  that's what happens in every country where you get a big out of control
[35:51.960 --> 35:54.520]  government that hires people to think they're god
[35:54.520 --> 35:59.160]  and we're not completely there yet but we're going there very quickly
[35:59.160 --> 36:02.200]  i mean you pull into one town it's nice friendly helpful police that are
[36:02.200 --> 36:05.240]  gentlemanly and honorable uh and then you pull into an
[36:05.240 --> 36:09.160]  excount it's like boss hog hell and it's all
[36:09.160 --> 36:12.760]  who runs things from the top down the the fish will ride
[36:12.760 --> 36:16.040]  from the head down and the globalists run america they run the federal
[36:16.040 --> 36:19.000]  government they've captured the federal government and now they run most counties
[36:19.000 --> 36:23.560]  and cities and most states in fact there's my video big ben
[36:23.560 --> 36:28.120]  police state visitors not welcome but my point is john baun
[36:28.120 --> 36:31.640]  one of the nightly news producers driving into work today saw one of the
[36:31.640 --> 36:35.320]  new giant wheeled homeland security bomb proof
[36:35.320 --> 36:39.400]  armored vehicles they delivered seven thousand plus this year alone
[36:39.400 --> 36:42.840]  to departments and i guess travis county got its
[36:42.840 --> 36:47.080]  vehicle dallas they were saying got what 14 of them
[36:47.080 --> 36:52.040]  to quote chase criminals oh yes no they're gearing up in the training manual
[36:52.040 --> 36:55.640]  say it for war with who the gun owners the
[36:55.640 --> 36:59.880]  conservatives the in the fetters the libertarians the returning veterans are
[36:59.880 --> 37:04.040]  number one of course they list ron paul in
[37:04.040 --> 37:07.720]  these federal training manuals the army manual says the founding fathers
[37:07.720 --> 37:10.680]  including george washington would not be welcome
[37:10.680 --> 37:14.680]  in today's military and that's a litmus test to see if you complain
[37:14.680 --> 37:18.040]  they mark you down to be deployed to heavy combat zones to be given extra
[37:18.040 --> 37:21.560]  vaccines literally of course the guy doing it doesn't know that but you're
[37:21.560 --> 37:24.760]  put in a database you take the test by computer
[37:24.760 --> 37:27.880]  and it tells you to sign off and check off on these computer
[37:27.880 --> 37:33.400]  files that you've read the manual and it's all conditioning
[37:33.400 --> 37:38.200]  just like the common core uh federal programs on computers even down to
[37:38.200 --> 37:42.440]  kindergartners now really starts about third grade with the
[37:42.440 --> 37:45.240]  heavy reading it's been in the news has you sign
[37:45.240 --> 37:48.680]  off that you agree that it's good for bobby to have two daddies
[37:48.680 --> 37:52.600]  you agree that mommy shouldn't yell at you
[37:52.600 --> 37:56.680]  you know that you know it's it's it's bad to tell somebody of
[37:56.680 --> 38:01.080]  mommy if mommy's smoking marijuana everything turns into a brainwashing
[38:01.080 --> 38:04.760]  tool i mean we're already there there are
[38:04.760 --> 38:08.120]  banned dodgeball and tag now they're banning bringing
[38:08.120 --> 38:13.080]  footballs to pass at lunch or at recess now they're banning walking
[38:13.080 --> 38:19.160]  and and jogging at many recess areas i saw that a few years ago the feds are
[38:19.160 --> 38:22.120]  pushing that where you have to sit down at recess on benches
[38:22.120 --> 38:25.640]  you're not even allowed to walk except to the bench and then back
[38:25.640 --> 38:31.400]  that is beyond supermax in a supermax i guess once a week they let you out into
[38:31.400 --> 38:34.280]  a little common area to walk in circles if you want
[38:34.280 --> 38:38.360]  in a regular heavy security facility i guess you get out like one hour a day
[38:38.360 --> 38:41.800]  and then minimum security uh you're pretty much out all the time except at
[38:41.800 --> 38:46.440]  nighttime um and they've got all these different levels and variance but
[38:46.440 --> 38:51.320]  everything from you're out one hour a day to you're out once a week
[38:51.320 --> 38:56.200]  and i guess they've got solitary where you're never out hardcore torture
[38:56.200 --> 39:00.680]  and again it's run by a system that is the master criminals
[39:00.680 --> 39:04.920]  they run the major criminal operations
[39:05.400 --> 39:09.240]  if you're a tv viewer watching an info wars dot com forward slash show
[39:09.240 --> 39:13.000]  you can actually see the giant armored vehicle here in travis county where i
[39:13.000 --> 39:17.240]  live and the swat teams are being expanded
[39:17.240 --> 39:22.440]  and they are training openly to take on the american people
[39:22.440 --> 39:28.680]  they're soldiers of the foreign power that's occupied america
[39:28.680 --> 39:31.800]  by the way the travis county swat team famously they had a the head of it was
[39:31.800 --> 39:35.400]  lieutenant beck and they sent them in to intimidate me
[39:35.400 --> 39:39.800]  not to speak at at travis county commissioner's court
[39:39.800 --> 39:43.400]  about fraud going on in the public schools they were
[39:43.400 --> 39:46.760]  arresting kids that were late to class three times when the truancy law said
[39:46.760 --> 39:53.400]  it was 12 12 absences unexcused in a semester uh was criminal
[39:53.400 --> 39:58.280]  um truancy but under color of law they were coming
[39:58.280 --> 40:02.600]  and even detaining and and filing uh under the absent
[40:02.600 --> 40:07.000]  student assistance program they're assisting you like everything else they
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.120]  do is uh the the patriot act the new freedom
[40:10.120 --> 40:13.640]  initiative the affordable care act it's it's the
[40:13.640 --> 40:17.240]  opposite of whatever they say so i kept going in every week to speak
[40:17.240 --> 40:20.760]  so they sent in swat team guys there's video of this somewhere my kansas got it
[40:20.760 --> 40:23.960]  and they sit on both sides of me and start threatening me so i jump up start
[40:23.960 --> 40:27.560]  yelling at them and then lieutenant beck comes over
[40:27.560 --> 40:30.200]  the next week is just come over my office we're not all bad look we got some
[40:30.200 --> 40:32.920]  of your videos on the wall you know we were just ordered to come over there
[40:32.920 --> 40:36.360]  and do that come on man there's no delta force in san antonio there's no
[40:36.360 --> 40:40.040]  the government's not dealing drugs i was in force recon in vietnam
[40:40.040 --> 40:43.160]  you know the military is not coming at you it's all made up
[40:43.160 --> 40:46.360]  you know and and about three months later he calls me he goes will you please
[40:46.360 --> 40:49.080]  come down here he goes oh yeah delta force was just here tried to bribe me
[40:49.080 --> 40:52.680]  it's all trip and i said can i talk about this he goes yeah go ahead see
[40:52.680 --> 40:56.280]  legal what they're doing well they fired him they fired him made up some stuff
[40:56.280 --> 40:59.480]  fired right after that so uh you know that's um
[40:59.480 --> 41:02.840]  i had the new head of the travis caddy swat team one time and i was
[41:02.840 --> 41:05.960]  lin lubies come over and start talking to me but
[41:05.960 --> 41:10.920]  i'm digressing you're not tuning in from all over the world to hear about that
[41:10.920 --> 41:15.640]  it's just that people better wake up to what's going on and better understand
[41:15.640 --> 41:20.040]  this is real because i know i'm right it's not my opinion the globalists are
[41:20.040 --> 41:25.080]  so arrogant 98 of what they're up to is all on record
[41:25.080 --> 41:28.120]  that is important to understand here that's what's so frustrating about this
[41:28.120 --> 41:32.680]  is that their program of total enslavement is public
[41:32.680 --> 41:35.160]  now let me uh just just run through the headlines let me just run through the
[41:35.160 --> 41:39.800]  headlines and i'll go back through them we'll see if i'm able to do this
[41:39.800 --> 41:46.600]  tensions ratcheted up in debate battle president presses gop floats short term
[41:46.600 --> 41:56.840]  borrowing increase but baner balks without deficit talks
[41:56.840 --> 42:02.600]  so attention ratchets up in the uh debt battle
[42:02.600 --> 42:09.160]  now what's so frustrating uh about all of this
[42:09.160 --> 42:15.400]  is that they are maneuvering us on record to total bankruptcy they've
[42:15.400 --> 42:18.840]  doubled the national debt under ovomet
[42:18.840 --> 42:23.000]  and uh his uh disgusting controllers and they know this
[42:23.000 --> 42:26.200]  and they know they're taking us the exact same direction they've taken greece
[42:26.200 --> 42:31.720]  and spain and france towards 100 percent taxation under the french model
[42:31.720 --> 42:34.600]  they've hired the head french economist to set it up here
[42:34.600 --> 42:39.720]  you're like they'll never do that yes they will they will put 100 taxes in
[42:39.720 --> 42:43.240]  on the middle class to totally bankrupt you and stall the economy
[42:43.240 --> 42:46.360]  because they themselves just like the french ruling class
[42:46.360 --> 42:50.120]  on record are 100 tax exempt and have swiss bank accounts
[42:50.120 --> 42:54.200]  and they run the federal government in france they're above the law
[42:54.200 --> 42:57.480]  it came out in every french newspaper six months ago
[42:57.480 --> 43:02.680]  that the entire elite have swiss bank accounts payoffs don't pay taxes
[43:02.680 --> 43:06.440]  the head of the imf is tax exempt but she wants you to work six seven days a
[43:06.440 --> 43:11.000]  week and pay higher taxes they are total criminals
[43:11.000 --> 43:14.600]  but the average person even in france is reading smartphones all day
[43:14.600 --> 43:18.200]  watching tv all day into fashion into being cool
[43:18.200 --> 43:21.720]  into how many sexual partners they can have and so they don't know what's
[43:21.720 --> 43:24.120]  happening
[43:24.440 --> 43:29.080]  and the average worker you know pays 65 70 in tax in france that's fine with
[43:29.080 --> 43:32.600]  them because they've got such class envy
[43:32.600 --> 43:35.560]  and that's the goal they're going to do that here as the ultra rich shut down
[43:35.560 --> 43:38.760]  their competition let me show you the weekly standard right here
[43:38.760 --> 43:43.960]  us adds two times more debt than economic output
[43:43.960 --> 43:49.480]  that's right they're pushing us well over 100 debt to gdp
[43:49.480 --> 43:54.680]  that's the goal is absolutely driving because it's all fiat these private
[43:54.680 --> 43:59.000]  bankers we're in debt because we bailed them out
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.920]  and then we go into debt to them for bailing them out remember that
[44:02.920 --> 44:07.320]  but the average person has no economics understanding so they get away with us
[44:07.320 --> 44:11.480]  there it is with the graph from the weekly standard of this source is the
[44:11.480 --> 44:14.440]  senate budget committee ranking member
[44:14.440 --> 44:20.120]  jeff sessons debt increase 2.4
[44:20.440 --> 44:23.400]  0 5 billion
[44:23.800 --> 44:31.880]  2 trillion 405 billion gdp increase 1.199
[44:31.880 --> 44:34.680]  you do the math folks and then obama talks about
[44:34.680 --> 44:38.520]  how their terror is trying to burn the house down in speech yesterday
[44:38.520 --> 44:42.360]  and that and that he's just trying to get the country going and that a debt
[44:42.360 --> 44:45.560]  increases in a debt increase and he's just trying to save us
[44:45.560 --> 44:49.560]  and his idiot you know you have some ideological extremist who has a
[44:49.560 --> 44:54.040]  a big bankroll and they can entirely skew our politics
[44:54.040 --> 44:58.280]  and there are a whole bunch of members of congress right now who privately will
[44:58.280 --> 45:03.000]  tell you i know our positions are unreasonable
[45:03.000 --> 45:06.840]  but we're scared that if we don't go along with
[45:06.840 --> 45:11.000]  the tea party agenda or the some particularly extremist agenda
[45:11.000 --> 45:15.960]  that will be challenged from the right that's right we're we're extremist
[45:15.960 --> 45:20.200]  because the national debt doubling in six years and obama spending more than
[45:20.200 --> 45:23.000]  all presidents before him back to george washington
[45:23.000 --> 45:26.520]  and the open clowered and pivot plan to bankrupt the country and shutting down
[45:26.520 --> 45:29.480]  the power plants shutting down the factories harassing every
[45:29.480 --> 45:33.320]  business and industry not owned by globalist all the bid rigging the tens of
[45:33.320 --> 45:36.680]  billions to his buddies and fake energy companies
[45:36.680 --> 45:39.880]  just shutting the nation down shutting development down
[45:39.880 --> 45:45.960]  shutting everything down in an orgy of control freak behavior
[45:45.960 --> 45:49.720]  letting the illegal aliens rally but arresting veterans if they try to go on
[45:49.720 --> 45:54.680]  the mall just every form of humiliation
[45:54.680 --> 46:00.280]  and then real libertarians are taken over the republican party
[46:00.280 --> 46:05.480]  and it's making the republican and democratic establishments totally
[46:05.480 --> 46:08.840]  freak out and of course john mccain will tell them off
[46:08.840 --> 46:12.840]  record i'm sorry these extremists don't want us to totally carry out our plan
[46:12.840 --> 46:16.600]  i'm sorry there's some opposition look you're the extremist in every federal
[46:16.600 --> 46:20.280]  training manual that's public fbi flyers to police departments by the
[46:20.280 --> 46:23.400]  thousands on their own website by the thousands they put hundreds out of
[46:23.400 --> 46:27.240]  year i mean the army is taught that their
[46:27.240 --> 46:31.000]  main enemy in the future at west point will be the tea party
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.720]  that's forbs and washington times reporting that after we broke it
[46:35.720 --> 46:42.600]  okay i'm explaining this to you ladies and gentlemen i'm trying to break this
[46:42.600 --> 46:45.640]  down right now
[46:47.160 --> 46:51.640]  the u.s army is taught george washington is bad who are the extremist
[46:51.640 --> 46:54.840]  federal funds teach two plus two equals five to kids
[46:54.840 --> 46:59.800]  who's the extremist these ought to actually be satire comedy writers
[46:59.800 --> 47:05.080]  dark satire comedy writers but it ain't funny because it's really happening
[47:05.080 --> 47:11.240]  who's teaching five-year-olds how to have anal sex in the public schools
[47:11.240 --> 47:15.400]  jocelyn elders wanted to teach three-year-olds one of the teachers to
[47:15.400 --> 47:19.240]  to to literally teach children how to masturbate
[47:19.240 --> 47:22.200]  and actually help them physically do it pedophilia
[47:22.200 --> 47:25.880]  they are openly pushing pedophilia and by the way that agenda they

[48:56.920 --> 49:00.120]  five thousand a year but we're not going to say how we're going to get it
[49:00.120 --> 49:04.040]  but but it's not true we're take the money but we're just going to take it
[49:04.040 --> 49:08.840]  that's a psychological warfare technique there's another one
[49:08.840 --> 49:13.560]  steward says the sabilias on health law am i a stupid man when she sits there

[49:27.080 --> 49:30.360]  that own the major insurance companies to shut down all their competition to
[49:30.360 --> 49:34.200]  lower the quality of care to jack up the prices and absolutely hammer the
[49:34.200 --> 49:37.400]  daylights out of you dummy i'm talking to the idiots that thought
[49:37.400 --> 49:40.760]  all these idiots are going i gotta pay i thought it was free oh yeah
[49:40.760 --> 49:43.960]  yeah loose i understand one of the concerns is actually about credit
[49:43.960 --> 49:49.000]  scores people are being asked to show their credit score when signing up
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.240]  that's right lisa it is asking you to show your credit score it is required
[49:53.240 --> 49:57.160]  and we were told if you have a low credit score it could affect what you pay
[49:57.160 --> 50:01.080]  all right by the way i haven't even gotten to this yet you know mike adams
[50:01.080 --> 50:04.760]  is not just an expert on health and wellness and one of the leading figures
[50:04.760 --> 50:06.920]  in the country on that because it was great research
[50:06.920 --> 50:10.360]  he's also an incredible programmer who started major companies you name and
[50:10.360 --> 50:14.360]  he's helped us out a lot of stuff he was able to go in and look at the whole
[50:14.360 --> 50:17.560]  obama care site and it's basically a fake front
[50:17.560 --> 50:21.160]  meant to not work i mean it's just like with the justice department
[50:21.160 --> 50:24.360]  uh block the amber alert the whole site was still there and programmers could
[50:24.360 --> 50:27.640]  see it they were just blocking it to say it was down when it wasn't down
[50:27.640 --> 50:31.160]  it's the same thing this is meant to not work it's all a sick joke
[50:31.160 --> 50:34.680]  that's why they've been trying to delay it until they can have all this shut down
[50:34.680 --> 50:37.640]  and blame republicans for all the problems
[50:37.640 --> 50:40.440]  so maybe michael connell is right go ahead let him have it

[56:03.480 --> 56:06.680]  you heard him it's the tea party that wants to
[56:06.680 --> 56:09.560]  not have a big debt increase they're the ones that have endangered our economy
[56:09.560 --> 56:12.360]  and our credit it's not the people that have maneuvered the country towards
[56:12.360 --> 56:17.080]  total bankruptcy to actually permit default according to many CEOs and
[56:17.080 --> 56:20.360]  economists would be and i'm quoting here insane

[56:32.600 --> 56:36.200]  recipient individually a banker bailout money and the new rape outs that
[56:36.200 --> 56:40.280]  they've been involved in the guy that wrote the laws to exempt
[56:40.280 --> 56:43.800]  himself from all the taxes who then talks about raising taxes on rich people
[56:43.800 --> 56:47.640]  who he means are the middle class he wants to destroy warren buffett that

[57:04.680 --> 57:10.520]  powerful for radio listeners but the video is unbelievable
[57:10.520 --> 57:14.200]  see the wilder the question you ask trendy liberals who are actually

[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:42.840]  gun was very clear district attorney george
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:46.360]  gaskin said these people are in very close proximity with him
[01:01:46.360 --> 01:01:50.120]  and nobody sees this they're just so engrossed texting and reading
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:53.560]  and whatnot they're completely oblivious to the surroundings
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.200]  that's right
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:02:00.120]  san francisco police say people that pay too much attention to digital
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:05.080]  technology are also vulnerable to theft you mean being zombies
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:07.960]  and they go on to say they interview a lot of crime victims that don't even
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:10.680]  know when their purse is taken off their arm
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:15.160]  and again folks it's medical the public is in a trance state
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.520]  from television and the flickering screens
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:23.560]  this is like bbc news reporting on studies and their their iqs have lowered
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:30.520]  their brainwaves have lowered and it's genius level now with a tv head if they
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:33.720]  know how to count to five basically i'm not
[01:02:33.720 --> 01:02:36.920]  kidding that's why they teach two plus two equals five in the public schools i'm
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.840]  not joking because this is the scientific wrecking
[01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:44.520]  of everyone ahead of the eugenics controlled kill
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:47.960]  bio weapon release the 12 monkey type scenario
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.920]  and the globalists all say it they say look at the public we've successfully
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:53.000]  dumbed them down their animals they deserve to die
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:56.280]  we're moving forward live extension technological program
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:02:59.720]  and it is just like lemmings running and jumping off a cliff
[01:02:59.720 --> 01:03:03.080]  we should create a is his famous footage of lemmings jumping off the cliff
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.360]  we should have like the obama symbol in the water below
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:11.320]  because when they see one lemming jump they all start jumping
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:14.680]  and they don't even swim once they jump in they just
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:18.760]  i'm telling you if there was a big obama symbol like floating on top of that
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:24.040]  that people if there could be razor blades spinning under them
[01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:27.880]  and then they all are dead and then they see the others drown themselves that
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.080]  one runs in to kill itself i mean this is it this is
[01:03:31.080 --> 01:03:34.440]  obama supporters they're not sheeple they're
[01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:39.560]  lemmings or lemming people i don't know how you say that
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.400]  and i'm not just making fun of them that's why msnbc talks about how smart
[01:03:43.400 --> 01:03:46.440]  liberals are all day and how they're the cult of how smart they are because they
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:49.000]  know they're just psychopathic predators
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:53.960]  hardcore fascist to use their paradigm ultra right wing
[01:03:53.960 --> 01:03:57.880]  and they literally know they're praying on jellyfish they like to sit there at
[01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:02.040]  home feeling like their upper level crust brain bug
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:06.040]  you know type cast thinking about how smart they are all day
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.480]  because even the smartest ones are just control freak psychopaths
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:13.560]  i just can't believe how disgusting these people are
[01:04:13.560 --> 01:04:17.080]  when we come back right out of the break ladies and gentlemen
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:20.440]  we're going to have the big surprise and then right after we air on the radio
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:23.960]  it's going to be posted via youtube up on info wars.com
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:29.240]  and prismplanet.com paul watson is in the process right now of writing a story
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:32.680]  i know it's a conspiracy theory once people read people wrote
[01:04:32.680 --> 01:04:36.200]  but i promise there's a country called the uk there's
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:39.720]  a country called england in the uk and there's a person named paul watson who
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:43.240]  writes things not talking to our regular listeners only the advanced
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:47.320]  intelligence liberals who are actually ultra fascist scumbag
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:50.920]  control freak trash who will do absolutely anything they're told
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:54.920]  and we're going to premiere this straight ahead inside the mind
[01:04:54.920 --> 01:04:58.200]  of absolute slaves begging for enslavement
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:05:02.600]  ben swan here we are winning alternative media is challenging

[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:25.960]  in the last decade we have seen actions by the nanny state
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:31.400]  in north america but also in europe that are beyond the absurdity
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:35.160]  that the great mind of kurt vonnegut could even come up with
[01:08:35.160 --> 01:08:40.840]  we have seen dodgeball and then tag band all across the country in thousands of
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:44.600]  school districts now they've announced in multiple states
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:49.560]  no more footballs or other balls will be allowed or other recreational
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:53.400]  materials on the playground during recess because
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:57.400]  someone might get hurt and it's because of this
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:01.640]  tyranny that's what it is meant to make us totally domesticated slaves
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:04.920]  that is being pushed by the federal government through the states
[01:09:04.920 --> 01:09:08.760]  that i thought of the idea of sending our reporters out
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:15.800]  in austin texas to talk to the public and see if they would accept wearing
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:19.960]  helmets by law to be able to walk down the street
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:23.960]  for their safety and for obama care to lower
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.880]  the price of premiums we talked to 20 people
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:34.600]  and 14 of them signed the petition to pass a law to make
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.000]  the general population wear helmets when you walk down the street
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.800]  think of the absurdity of this and to try to wake them up the petition was even
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:48.360]  titled chumps of course the universal term for
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:51.800]  meaning you're an idiot a mark a fool a schmuck
[01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:56.200]  a a a sucker this is not satire this is not a joke
[01:09:56.200 --> 01:10:02.840]  this is really happening this is the amazing level of conditioning and
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:05.640]  brainwashing that the general public especially
[01:10:05.640 --> 01:10:11.640]  trendies are under here is leon macadoo and josh oan's report
[01:10:11.640 --> 01:10:15.400]  can i get you to sign my petition to compel people to wear helmets while
[01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:21.480]  they're walking can we can i get you to sign up
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:26.920]  to make everyone wear one just go ahead that'd be a mandatory law or something
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:29.960]  you're saying i mean i hope so we can get it passed
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:34.440]  oh my gosh texting while walking texting while walking
[01:10:34.440 --> 01:10:37.240]  do you know i'm actually about to place a call
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.560]  still you know in new jersey they're giving out 85 dollar tickets for people
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.720]  that are caught texting while walking and they're going to start doing that
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:49.800]  here that's why i am trying to get a petition
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:53.080]  to get people to wear helmets while they're walking
[01:10:53.080 --> 01:10:57.320]  oh perfect yeah that's great everyone who just
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:11:01.160]  doesn't want to pay attention who just wants to like zombie out can just walk
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:05.240]  in a special lane that's made just for them but until then
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.520]  everyone just needs to have like protective gear on so that
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:13.400]  i'm not gonna hurt you you won't hurt me yes i also
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:18.120]  i think it's a good idea i will you want to make everybody wear helmets
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:22.520]  these dummies need to wear here that's great just make everything safe
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.400]  for me i'm a libertarian you know for me i feel like as long as you don't cause
[01:11:25.400 --> 01:11:29.000]  any harm oh a libertarist to just get people to start
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:35.160]  wearing helmets to keep people safe on the streets
[01:11:35.160 --> 01:11:39.000]  hold on that way everyone can just top on their phones
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:42.120]  and text freely and they don't have to worry and it will help keep like
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.920]  insurance costs down right thank you yeah while walking yes
[01:11:46.920 --> 01:11:52.120]  why while walking so they don't endanger themselves
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:55.400]  say that again i was texting and i just slipped
[01:11:55.400 --> 01:11:59.400]  right on a thing just like this and it was wet
[01:11:59.400 --> 01:12:03.160]  and i was like and it was so embarrassing and everyone saw and they
[01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:07.480]  were all laughing at me and i couldn't sue anyone for my butt
[01:12:07.480 --> 01:12:11.400]  i hit my tailbone and i was like limping for a week
[01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:15.000]  like we're all in this together like we have socialized health care now so it's
[01:12:15.000 --> 01:12:19.000]  like everyone's responsible for everyone so
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:23.480]  if i fall you fall well you can get them like form fitted to your head
[01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:27.160]  they can have like special gear you can make them like tactical you could get
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:31.320]  like with the put the water bottles they have those that
[01:12:31.320 --> 01:12:36.120]  you wear at the baseball park i mean i like helmets
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.520]  they're already kind of starting this whole thing like in new york
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:42.520]  they're banning dodgeball banning other sports that are going to hurt people
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.240]  and get people injured and like one of the most dangerous things is
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:50.120]  is walking yeah people just walk out in front of a bus
[01:12:50.120 --> 01:12:56.760]  so and you make sense technically so guys would you like to sign this petition
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:13:00.600]  to get people to wear helmets while walking
[01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:06.120]  super trendy well i think ut we're super trendy
[01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:09.320]  so we can get it what starts here changes the world i'm
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:14.200]  i'm down for it we can't be trusted and that's why if we can just make this a
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:18.200]  law a rule that we can enforce no of course tickets for anyone without
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:23.640]  helmets godspeed you can do it i believe
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:29.480]  so and as long as you say super trendy or say it's for
[01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:32.840]  obama they will sign it we went and talked to
[01:13:32.840 --> 01:13:37.160]  20 people 14 signed it maybe tonight on the nightly news we can show a few clips
[01:13:37.160 --> 01:13:40.920]  because you're hosting at leon of the people that actually were against it
[01:13:40.920 --> 01:13:43.960]  because there's only a few clips of them in there i like to show people that
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:47.480]  actually have a brain and most these people are not inherently evil
[01:13:47.480 --> 01:13:51.400]  they're just incredibly pathetic incredibly gullible
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.760]  and as long as you say it's progressive it's trendy let's do it and remember
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:58.920]  they've banned first dodgeball then running some recess areas you have to
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.800]  sit down now this is total prisoner training and it's
[01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:05.080]  being done by design and so josh owens went out there and
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:08.840]  rammed camera uh josh let's get your take on this first and then leon's
[01:14:08.840 --> 01:14:12.200]  uh you've only been working here a few months doing great job at the nsa as
[01:14:12.200 --> 01:14:15.240]  well for folks that don't know who you are you shot camera on that
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:19.400]  what is it like to actually go out and and now not just be watching us on
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:23.240]  prisonplanet.tv or on youtube or listening to radio but to actually
[01:14:23.240 --> 01:14:27.000]  be behind the scenes here and then to go out and see the victims
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.040]  of the brainwashing well what's so crazy about it is
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:33.080]  you would think that we would have went out there and talked to a hundred people
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:37.800]  and 14 would have signed and literally we talked to 20 people and 14 of them
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:42.040]  signed and they were so oblivious i wasn't even that far away
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:46.040]  from the people with the camera and they didn't even notice me they didn't
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:49.320]  even they're so oblivious of their surroundings they didn't even look to
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.280]  their right to see that i was standing there filming them
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:55.800]  and leon you came in this morning and pointed out the point that police
[01:14:55.800 --> 01:14:59.320]  say rail commuters on phones didn't notice a gun the guy pulled his gun out
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.920]  put it to people's heads deciding who he wanted to kill literally just dripping
[01:15:02.920 --> 01:15:06.600]  with psychopathic enjoyment and then finally chose some young woman
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:09.960]  and no one even noticed he was going around with a gun pointing at it people
[01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:13.960]  that's how self-centered they are they're worse than like dodo birds that
[01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:16.600]  had never been around humans and the sailors show up to eat them and they
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:19.560]  don't even run it's just they have no common sense they just go
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:24.200]  oh i love you one of those ladies you talked to the big tall blonde
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:28.040]  she actually went okay she actually made a sheep noise
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:32.040]  did you notice that i did it i laughed what's happening i mean what what is
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:34.680]  this like because when i sent you out you said they're not going to be this
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:38.040]  dumb no i was actually psyching myself up to be
[01:15:38.040 --> 01:15:41.240]  laughed off the street like i just was expecting people are going to be like
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:45.000]  what a moron you want us to wear helmets but they were like yeah i like helmets
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  so oh it'll bring my insurance premiums down that makes sense so
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  yeah it was uh very surprising i was getting into it i mean i think if you
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:56.360]  went out and said for obama stab your children in the head with ice picks
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:59.240]  they would actually i'm serious i think i think half would do it
[01:15:59.240 --> 01:16:02.280]  because if it's for obama there's no way he can be wrong
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:05.640]  so like of course if they actually have kids that would be stronger than their
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:07.960]  obama worship but if you talk to people that didn't have kids and said we want
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:10.760]  to slit children's throats for obama they'd probably do it
[01:16:10.760 --> 01:16:14.120]  i'm not kidding in fact i want to do that next gosh
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:17.160]  don't send me out well people were so no no we went out and said kill babies up
[01:16:17.160 --> 01:16:20.760]  to age three and they signed it yes for obama they sure did everybody else
[01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:24.440]  then copied our piece which is great yeah they sure did and we were it's okay
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:28.600]  to kill babies up to age three it was for obama you're not racist are you yeah
[01:16:28.600 --> 01:16:32.200]  well because it it's a burden on the family
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:36.520]  children people were so i mean people were just out there in just a submissive
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.000]  state all it took yeah some people initially they were just like i don't
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.640]  know and then all it took was lian to just be like oh are you walking while
[01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:45.880]  texting and they were just like okay i'll sign it
[01:16:45.880 --> 01:16:49.080]  to lian they're submissive so to the government of course they're submissive
[01:16:49.080 --> 01:16:52.120]  to anyone who has power of course they're submissive
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:57.000]  and that's why you now have a busload of japanese and german tourists and
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:01.720]  canadiens pulling up at yellowstone and it's like we're shut down pulling guns
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:05.960]  on them like it's an fbi crime bust because literally everyone grovels all
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:09.320]  day to them oh my gosh here it is do you really
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.440]  need a helmet to play soccer school districts says all students must wear
[01:17:12.440 --> 01:17:16.120]  headgear to prevent concussions while playing non-contact sports
[01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:20.520]  uh in uh england so so here it is well they're already saying just no no playing
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:24.440]  ball period the ap headline was don't bring your balls to school
[01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:29.800]  right exactly don't play with your balls just no more recreational activities
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:33.320]  because they go and they just spend all day in school just you know from nine in
[01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:36.360]  the morning well they want to get us ready for the total takeover i mean
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:40.120]  this is a military takeover so of course you're not allowed look two plus two
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:42.520]  equals five if you want to screw kids up you teach them that
[01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:46.280]  yeah kids two plus two equals five teach the five-year-olds how to have anal
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:49.320]  sex that's freedom it sounds like freedom to me
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:55.640]  USA USA what about the one liver terrorist i don't
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:17:59.400]  want to give the southern part of law center ideas you pundit didn't i did i
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:02.600]  i don't know it just came to me and i felt kind of bad because he was actually
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:07.240]  the only person he was so calm and just really trying to rationalize with me
[01:18:07.240 --> 01:18:10.280]  like really you want you want people to wear helmets and
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:14.040]  just and he was so polite and i was just being really outrageous and and he's
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.360]  like look i'm a libertarian and i was like
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:19.720]  libertarian can we show to nine on the nightly news
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.640]  the uh outtakes of the three or four people that actually could talk
[01:18:23.640 --> 01:18:27.640]  because notice the people that signed are like uh uh and then they sign and go
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:31.400]  more power to you yeah they know it's outrageous where they go i submit to it
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:34.360]  that makes it okay exactly if it's gonna if it's going to help
[01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:37.640]  obama i'm all for it it's going to help
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:41.480]  socialize my health care it'll help do it like insurance costs down
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:46.840]  right thank you right that is literally a sheeple
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:50.360]  yeah i think i think their new mascot should be
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:54.280]  lemmings running off a cliff we need to make a t-shirt about like
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:57.400]  trendy it's cool enough like a cliff with lemmings running off
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:01.560]  first the lemmings won't get it but it's a facebook thing
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:05.400]  they're adorable hashtag lemmings
[01:19:06.040 --> 01:19:11.160]  hashtag annoying dara mcbrane was at some outdoor concert he was telling me

[01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:19.560]  woman beside him says hashtag annoying no and then some woman goes
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:23.320]  hashtag angry well that's actually how they communicate now
[01:19:23.320 --> 01:19:28.840]  that's our vernacular now it's wow idiocracy right yeah well and if they
[01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:31.400]  intellectually can't debate you on something you're like i think the
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:35.960]  quantum mechanics theory is actually being uh unified with the unified field
[01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:41.160]  theory of the cyclotronic uh proving of the hadron test of last march they go
[01:19:41.160 --> 01:19:46.760]  sounds pretty racist racist oh i actually think the kinesian system
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:49.640]  itself is a fraud but they're even diverging from that we're gonna have
[01:19:49.640 --> 01:19:54.920]  hyperstack inflation sounds racist he's writing a book racist let's do one more

[01:24:12.600 --> 01:24:17.320]  so they're eight feet tall the girls uh the men by the genetic engineering and
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:20.280]  the chemicals put in the food are stunted and have low IQs
[01:24:20.280 --> 01:24:23.640]  this is all brave new world oldest hoxley's brother ran the un
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.440]  program said no this book i wrote in 32 is the real plan
[01:24:26.440 --> 01:24:30.280]  we're putting additives in nothing can save you he gave a speech at berkeley
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:34.280]  in 62 right before he died basically laughing at everyone
[01:24:34.280 --> 01:24:38.200]  and so we're now in this paradigm and these people have very low IQs on
[01:24:38.200 --> 01:24:41.000]  average uh the the number show the us is now
[01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:44.120]  dumbest country in the world england trails behind us and it's been done
[01:24:44.120 --> 01:24:47.000]  chemically and biologically the white house science i wrote a book about it in
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.080]  70s bragging and so we laugh at these people
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:57.640]  it's a mix of chemical biological uh but more than uh nurture
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:02.360]  it is it is an artificial system of nature being manipulated
[01:25:02.360 --> 01:25:06.520]  and then the brainwashing is the nurture uh using the scientific terms for
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:09.320]  development of these people to totally dumb them down
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:12.280]  and it's gotten to the point where people are in such trances being
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:16.440]  interfaced with the computers in television that is not interactive and
[01:25:16.440 --> 01:25:20.040]  it's not challenging uh that they're losing their humanity early
[01:25:20.040 --> 01:25:22.520]  on set of neurological disorders are happening
[01:25:22.520 --> 01:25:26.120]  early on set of Alzheimer's and 35 year olds is now happening
[01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:30.120]  and it's directly attributable to the television and screen time
[01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:33.400]  it's brain damaging children and you add the chemicals the biologicals the
[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:37.400]  radiologicals to it it is a cocktail for disaster
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:41.160]  uh closing comments on this leon you were pointing out the whole google glasses
[01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.600]  thing is the next level of this but not only are they some idiots stumbling
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.200]  around now they're surveilling you for google and tell us what you're going to
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:50.920]  cover on the nightly news tonight what eric schmidt had to say
[01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:54.920]  well eric schmidt said that he didn't want to cross the creepy line
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.760]  of implanting chips in people's heads and then he

[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:26.440]  by the way when you see the film demolition man one of the better
[01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:31.560]  Sylvester Stallone movies it's a nanny state corporate global tyranny that
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:36.200]  shut down all this competition that gives you tickets and finds if you're not
[01:33:36.200 --> 01:33:39.240]  trendy if you try to run your given tickets if you
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:42.200]  cuss your given tickets and then it turns out the underground
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:45.560]  criminal networks actually run by the government that that wants everybody
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:48.360]  domesticated so we can use the hardcore criminals
[01:33:48.360 --> 01:33:52.520]  on whoever they want who've been disarmed and they're telling you through
[01:33:52.520 --> 01:33:55.320]  fiction what their real plan is cast sunstein
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:58.600]  has written multiple papers at the white house on this
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:02.200]  minification they have thousands of armored vehicles
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:06.120]  billions of rounds of ammo checkpoints they're training with no hesitation to
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:09.320]  shoot five-year-old children remember remember those
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:13.160]  paper targets homeland security bot demonizing the founding fathers all of
[01:34:13.160 --> 01:34:19.400]  it while telling you that fatherhoods bad and families
[01:34:19.400 --> 01:34:23.800]  are bad and don't use the word mother or father or husband or wife in government
[01:34:23.800 --> 01:34:27.320]  circles because it's hateful towards gays or lesbians and
[01:34:27.320 --> 01:34:30.760]  your children belong to the state ms nbc says in promos
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:37.480]  this is the takeover this is the program of total control
[01:34:37.480 --> 01:34:40.760]  where they're all macho paramilitary but only them
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:43.800]  then the number one enemy once they've taken over is the veterans
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:47.320]  who aren't of any use to them anymore that's why they're going to autonomous
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:49.800]  drones autonomous robots that's the pentagon plan
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:53.880]  from the 70s well now defense one reports why america
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:57.320]  wants drones that can kill without humans they've had autonomous drones for at
[01:34:57.320 --> 01:35:01.160]  least five years making the decisions making the kills
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:05.800]  the pentagon plan by 2025 is to have almost no humans on the battlefield
[01:35:05.800 --> 01:35:09.080]  you're going to have humans vector lasing targets and as maintenance people
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:13.000]  working on all sorts of systems where a
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:16.360]  cruise missile flies over and releases a hundred
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:21.080]  little bat winged if we've shown that the pentagon air force promo video they
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:24.360]  already have this developed and it flaps down and it's got either
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:28.360]  high explosive or it's either got a projectile system
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.800]  it surveils you and then kills you so this is also the ultimate coward system
[01:35:33.800 --> 01:35:39.480]  where where no one is able to basically stand down on order that's unconstitutional
[01:35:39.480 --> 01:35:41.560]  now i don't think it's all going to work perfectly
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:45.720]  i don't think it's all going to get there i don't think that check it out
[01:35:45.720 --> 01:35:48.200]  stir it see if they're in the wall i don't think that they're going to be
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:52.120]  successful with all of this but this is their plan
[01:35:52.120 --> 01:35:55.240]  this is their program we're going to stir it roads in a moment but
[01:35:55.240 --> 01:35:59.320]  the video that we just premiered here on the radio slash tv will be going up on
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.760]  prisonplanet.com and info wars.com and i will
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:06.600]  tweet it at real alex jones when it goes up in the next five ten minutes
[01:36:06.600 --> 01:36:09.240]  paul watson's writing the article about it right now
[01:36:09.240 --> 01:36:17.240]  where 14 out of 20 that's what 70 plus percent in austin texas
[01:36:17.240 --> 01:36:22.360]  signed a petition that said you are a chump it actually said you are a chump on
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:26.600]  the top and austin chumps wants to ban walking
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:29.080]  without a helmet and by the way they already got billboards up the big
[01:36:29.080 --> 01:36:33.080]  flashing one saying if you drink and walk don't drink and walk
[01:36:33.080 --> 01:36:36.680]  and i asked the cops they said no if we see you drink and come out of a bar
[01:36:36.680 --> 01:36:40.520]  walking not with a beer but we're going to arrest you for drinking and walking
[01:36:40.520 --> 01:36:44.200]  so so folks this is the nanny state tyranny
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:48.840]  on pcp and and i got to say it i believe we've topped it with the trendies
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:52.840]  here i mean we found the new level and i'm
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:56.200]  telling you it's scary as long as you say it's trendy or it's for obama
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:00.040]  they will do anything next i'm going to send the crew out
[01:37:00.040 --> 01:37:04.360]  to say that we need to euthanize all children under age 10 for the earth
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:07.800]  or maybe like euthanized all white children of the age of 10
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.720]  to make up for slavery and i predict 60 percent will sign
[01:37:11.720 --> 01:37:15.960]  for killing all white children i'm not joking i'm not joking
[01:37:15.960 --> 01:37:19.480]  okay i'm not kidding around here you don't understand the magnitude of the
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:22.840]  mind control they're under and i want to create a video on youtube
[01:37:22.840 --> 01:37:26.440]  nothing outly news because it's condensed where we show unedited

[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:34.520]  because i mean this is not staged folks

[01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:43.240]  it was four we said for obama we're going to ban the hydrogen monoxide
[01:37:43.240 --> 01:37:46.680]  and the guys like sitting there hitting on macadoo going yeah you know i've got

[01:41:00.760 --> 01:41:06.600]  all right steward rhodeslman nightly news with us last night the founder of
[01:41:06.600 --> 01:41:10.520]  oathkeepers constitutional lawyer also worked with
[01:41:10.520 --> 01:41:15.240]  ron paul as one of his staffers and in the last six seven years since he left
[01:41:15.240 --> 01:41:19.240]  there he's really done yeoman's work it's also an army paratrooper
[01:41:19.240 --> 01:41:23.160]  retired from the army via a paratrooping accident
[01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:26.520]  and he's just a great all-around guy good friend of mine got to know him over
[01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:29.480]  the years and he's here in austin with us for
[01:41:29.480 --> 01:41:33.080]  obama deception too but i wanted to get him in studio today
[01:41:33.080 --> 01:41:38.600]  live on air to really try to give you the floor to break down where we are as a
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:42.280]  republic what the enemy's doing you've wargamed it i've wargamed it you've
[01:41:42.280 --> 01:41:45.320]  wargamed a lot of special warfare people i've read the globalist own
[01:41:45.320 --> 01:41:48.520]  literature their biggest mistake is operating like we're all completely
[01:41:48.520 --> 01:41:51.560]  brain damaged when that's not true they may have shut down these
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:54.920]  lemmings with chemical warfare and psychological brainwashing it hasn't
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:58.120]  worked on us it's on the opposite it's like being tortured every day we're so
[01:41:58.120 --> 01:42:01.880]  awake it's incredible and we know they're one major ace in the
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.600]  hole what they're going to pull it's already
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:08.280]  incremental shut down of the economy they're going to drop the hammer
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:10.920]  because they know they're running out of time repeat what you said last night in
[01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:14.760]  the interview for obama deception too break down the battle space break down
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:17.800]  the future break down the destiny we have
[01:42:17.800 --> 01:42:21.080]  and how hard we better work now to try to reverse it before
[01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:24.840]  they completely implode the economy number one mission is get prepared
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:28.120]  number two exposed they're the ones behind the implosion as they've done
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:32.280]  everywhere else steward rode's founder of oathkeepers oathkeepers.org
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:37.320]  organization is exploding your military contacts give you the same info we get
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:41.880]  half the military is awake right now it's accelerating the enemy is in crisis
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:44.520]  steward rode's. Yeah at least half of them in fact and
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:47.960]  among special warfare personnel it's more like 75 percent
[01:42:47.960 --> 01:42:51.400]  and this is the problem they have is the powers that be understand
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:55.560]  that there's now a growing sizable percentage of the population
[01:42:55.560 --> 01:42:58.680]  who can no longer be fooled they've taken the red pill
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:43:03.160]  they see what's going on and they're no longer manipulative with their
[01:43:03.160 --> 01:43:08.520]  false flags or their use of fear so they they know that their time is limited
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:13.160]  give it enough time we will prevail it could wind up like 1989 East Germany
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:16.520]  where you had a mass stand down on the military and a mass stand-up of the
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:18.840]  people and without the support of the military to
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:21.560]  stop you're running and hiding because they couldn't they couldn't overpower
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:24.440]  the people there's no way they could do it so that's possible
[01:43:24.440 --> 01:43:28.280]  but i think that before we get to that tipping point of that mass awareness
[01:43:28.280 --> 01:43:31.480]  which we will if we're allowed the time i think they'll try to pull the plug on
[01:43:31.480 --> 01:43:35.720]  the economy it's all they have left they have their their armageddon option
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:39.240]  of the economic neutron bomb collapse the dollar kill the dollar
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:43.480]  blame it on the chinese especially under under the cover of a war with syria
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:46.920]  they could say hey we entered syria to get rid of chemical weapons
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:50.200]  and the russians and chinese italian economically they wanted that war as
[01:43:50.200 --> 01:43:53.960]  political cover but now that's failing that their gun grab failed i mean
[01:43:53.960 --> 01:43:56.760]  they're desperate so they but but they still could pull out the plug
[01:43:56.760 --> 01:44:00.920]  on the economy and kill the dollar and start a run on the dollar rule wide
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:04.760]  and that could be potentially as destructive as a nuclear exchange or an
[01:44:04.760 --> 01:44:07.240]  emp strike because you kill the economy
[01:44:07.240 --> 01:44:10.360]  americans don't have food storage americans are the most unprepared
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:13.880]  population on the face that's been done by design they've encouraged that
[01:44:13.880 --> 01:44:17.240]  absolutely they prepared themselves relentlessly they've been
[01:44:17.240 --> 01:44:20.760]  been putting in place mechanisms for control all the weapons they would need
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:23.240]  all the all the armored armored vehicles they would need and all the
[01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:26.200]  ammunition they would need to control us or kill us
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:28.600]  did you see that marine corps colonel that went public and said they're
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:31.720]  pre-deploying everything against us? absolutely you've been
[01:44:31.720 --> 01:44:35.640]  and anybody who's been in military training understands
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:40.040]  logistics logistics wins the battle it's not gonna be a rifle and and and run
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:43.240]  out the street like bravely. it's mass and supply chain and then initiative
[01:44:43.240 --> 01:44:47.320]  it's logistics and so on our side they are preparing a future battle space on
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:50.920]  their side for their benefit on our side we need to be careful
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:54.840]  about being distracted with all this bombardment of negative information
[01:44:54.840 --> 01:44:58.040]  or they're doing this and doing that let's go protest here let's go protest
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:01.720]  there but be careful about that because we only have so much blood in our bodies
[01:45:01.720 --> 01:45:05.400]  a good analogy is that they're hooked up to an unlimited blood bank
[01:45:05.400 --> 01:45:08.840]  through Soros or through the Federal Reserve like you just said you know the
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:13.160]  funding for NPR is is billions of dollars versus what do we get on our
[01:45:13.160 --> 01:45:16.760]  side it's individuals we have to fund our campaigns
[01:45:16.760 --> 01:45:19.320]  and so be careful about you go and spend your money on
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:22.920]  or your or your time and your and your sweat because you only have so much
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:26.840]  and so rather than running around protesting everywhere sometimes protests
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:30.040]  make a big difference i think the symbolic virtue
[01:45:30.040 --> 01:45:33.560]  of the veterans in in washington dc the world war two veterans
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:37.560]  kicking down the barricades going in anyway is is very valuable
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:41.240]  something like that is worth getting behind sure second amendment
[01:45:41.240 --> 01:45:44.840]  nullification i mean i think it's full spectrum get ready yourself
[01:45:44.840 --> 01:45:48.360]  but also be on the offensive in the info war i say do everything
[01:45:48.360 --> 01:45:51.800]  sure but be careful about spending all your time just running around waving a
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:55.800]  sign they want you to do that what they don't want you to do is in your local
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:59.880]  areas stand up oh i agree you need to be going to talk to police chief and
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:03.720]  warning i'm giving him info finding out getting intelligence where they stand
[01:46:03.720 --> 01:46:06.680]  you need to be getting with the military veterans preparing
[01:46:06.680 --> 01:46:09.960]  for not fighting but preparing to be leaders in your area
[01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:12.920]  absolutely that's why we started a new initiative within oathkeepers we're
[01:46:12.920 --> 01:46:16.680]  calling it the civilian presence of civilization preservation teams
[01:46:16.680 --> 01:46:20.440]  and the whole focus is on getting our community squared away at the very bottom
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:23.800]  right down in the neighborhood watches right down in the veterans halls in
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:27.640]  particular because we've gotten the guns in the ammo now we need to really do the
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:30.040]  boots on the ground ready to take care of our neighbors
[01:46:30.040 --> 01:46:33.480]  that'll put us in the leadership position immediately the logistics
[01:46:33.480 --> 01:46:36.840]  you need to have the ability to feed your neighbors
[01:46:36.840 --> 01:46:40.360]  to have communications to have clean water and power
[01:46:40.360 --> 01:46:43.560]  and to have emergency medical care because by the way when stuff collapses
[01:46:43.560 --> 01:46:46.360]  they're coming anyways right that's what you need that's what you need
[01:46:46.360 --> 01:46:49.640]  look at any hurricane each tornado any any natural disaster
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:53.560]  what do you wind up needing any clean water you need shelter you need to keep
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:56.920]  warm and any medical care and food those are things you need
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:00.360]  so why not get that squared away in your own neighborhood right now
[01:47:00.360 --> 01:47:03.400]  so you are able to take care of things you are able to be
[01:47:03.400 --> 01:47:07.640]  the force for good in your community rather than them all being desperate
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:11.160]  and scared and relying on FEMA coming in who says hey
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:14.600]  yes sure we'll give you food turning your guns turning your neighbors and the
[01:47:14.600 --> 01:47:17.160]  police are already priming the pump all over the country in
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:21.160]  Detroit and LA saying we'll give you grocery money for your guns
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:24.280]  you bet you'll get you'll get the ebt card if you turn in your neighbor
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:28.040]  you turn in your guns so we need to make sure that we are strong
[01:47:28.040 --> 01:47:31.880]  if you have a squared away community it's much more likely the national guard
[01:47:31.880 --> 01:47:35.000]  will refuse the orders the police will fuse the orders and the active duty
[01:47:35.000 --> 01:47:39.160]  military in particular will say no to gun confiscation but they plan on
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:42.760]  having all the welfare folks riot where if you're not ready you'll bag the
[01:47:42.760 --> 01:47:45.640]  military in well sure and not just welfare folks average
[01:47:45.640 --> 01:47:48.920]  americans who go to nine to five jobs right now have how much food they're in
[01:47:48.920 --> 01:47:51.960]  their in their house two days three or four days at the most right
[01:47:51.960 --> 01:47:55.320]  probably more two days so wait a week two
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:58.840]  they're just as desperate as any and the globalists admit they've done all this
[01:47:58.840 --> 01:48:02.280]  by design getting us ready like the ukraine under the soviets
[01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:06.680]  for the cultural reeducation like mal did they the same thing in china
[01:48:06.680 --> 01:48:10.600]  this is a tried and true plan day the Rockefeller said we will use food as a
[01:48:10.600 --> 01:48:12.680]  weapon in america sure you look the historic
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:16.600]  precedents in uh Stalinist Russia Stalin starved out the koolax
[01:48:16.600 --> 01:48:19.400]  independent farmers confiscated all their food and killed them
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:22.440]  through mass starvation and the same thing happened with Mao in china
[01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:26.920]  anytime the government wants to stop a mass of people who they cannot just
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:29.800]  kill outright with weapons that will use starvation
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:33.080]  but we're not just saying this this is on record they the globalists have all
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:36.200]  written we are under globalist occupation we've still got some resistance
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:39.640]  and some media people are waking up but they really would like to do this if
[01:48:39.640 --> 01:48:42.120]  they can get away with it sure and so we need to see it as they're
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:45.480]  shipping the future battle space we know a fight's coming you need to
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:49.400]  recognize and realize that if we can do it like i said with a
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:53.160]  enough of awakening we could be a peaceful a peaceful result revolution
[01:48:53.160 --> 01:48:57.400]  a mass standout like in 1990s germany but we should presume the worst that
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:49:00.760]  before that can happen they'll pull the plug and try to starve us out
[01:49:00.760 --> 01:49:04.440]  what i like about your plan is that it's historical it's well researched and
[01:49:04.440 --> 01:49:08.280]  you're not seeing oath keepers runs at all it's a basic blueprint
[01:49:08.280 --> 01:49:13.400]  of peaceful preparation and resistance civilization preservation teams start
[01:49:13.400 --> 01:49:16.440]  them everywhere the enemy can infiltrate us everywhere
[01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:20.280]  plus they've lost the major initiative the average police and especially the
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:24.200]  military now know we told the truth because of patriots decades ago
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:26.440]  warning people they're like wow these folks knew
[01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:29.800]  what was coming they're now listening to us they love their family
[01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:32.520]  they know their their paycheck doesn't go anywhere anymore
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:36.440]  they know they're being sold out they know george washington's being brainwashed
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:40.280]  how did the globalists miscalculate to openly badmouth the founding fathers in
[01:49:40.280 --> 01:49:43.880]  the official army training manual now i mean that shows the traders have taken
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:45.960]  over i mean that's conviction right there
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:49.640]  i think it's their own hubris they like i went to yola school and i can tell you
[01:49:49.640 --> 01:49:53.240]  it's an incestuous community they talk to each other only they go to these
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:57.080]  special uh confabs with other elites and so they don't really see
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:01.160]  what's going on in small town america they believe their own bull basically
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:04.200]  their own property they're smoking their own dope exactly smoking their own dope
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:07.400]  and so they have the hubris and arrogance to believe they got it all figured out
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:12.280]  they have not successfully undermine our culture they have not successfully don't
[01:50:12.280 --> 01:50:15.960]  they know that the patriots for 50 years saw this coming mainly military guys
[01:50:15.960 --> 01:50:18.920]  that were inside the intelligence briefings and learned about this takeover
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:22.200]  they've been trying forever don't they know we have a massive jump on them and
[01:50:22.200 --> 01:50:26.440]  have been warning people for decades no i think they don't i think they they
[01:50:26.440 --> 01:50:28.920]  believe they've got it all figured out and they're too smart but they're too
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:32.040]  smart for their own good so they're they're uh intellectual idiots and
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:34.840]  they've taken our restraint as weakness as well that's right
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:37.640]  same thing that british did with the with the founding fathers they believe
[01:50:37.640 --> 01:50:41.320]  that because they had put up with so much abuse and a long chain of abuses
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.920]  that they would never fight and they were very wrong
[01:50:44.920 --> 01:50:47.400]  well i hope they listen because i know they're watching i know the white house
[01:50:47.400 --> 01:50:50.520]  is watching on record you globalist will be brought to

[01:54:09.240 --> 01:54:12.440]  democratic congresswoman suggests martial law
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:15.880]  to end government shutdown and she means political martial law
[01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:19.480]  these really unconstitutional procedures to just force
[01:54:19.480 --> 01:54:22.120]  force this through and ignore what the house is doing and
[01:54:22.120 --> 01:54:26.760]  new republic called for obama two days ago to do exactly what
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:30.040]  yeltsin did but the duma had clearly been kicked out though so that was more
[01:54:30.040 --> 01:54:34.200]  legitimate even though he was a crook as well attack the congress basically
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:38.360]  throw him out i mean it really shows the mindset of these
[01:54:38.360 --> 01:54:41.800]  people like when the internal irs memos came out and turned out they were
[01:54:41.800 --> 01:54:45.080]  ordered by obama to go after the tea party the memos were like these are
[01:54:45.080 --> 01:54:47.400]  scary dangerous people we've got to shut them down
[01:54:47.400 --> 01:54:51.080]  it's like they don't want communism they're scary
[01:54:51.080 --> 01:54:54.040]  so the mid-level people even though she was one of the head irs people that she
[01:54:54.040 --> 01:54:58.520]  still mid-level they're like communist and socialist ideologues but the
[01:54:58.520 --> 01:55:01.000]  people above them are just piratical mega banks
[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:04.280]  but their cannon fodder it's like that white house petition they had they got
[01:55:04.280 --> 01:55:08.920]  like a hundred thousand signatures to form communist militias to take on the
[01:55:08.920 --> 01:55:11.480]  tea party i mean they're dreaming of like their
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:14.280]  shea guvara and they're going to take us out stewart rhodes
[01:55:14.280 --> 01:55:17.640]  they're useful idiots that's what they are you said the people pulled the strings
[01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:20.920]  behind them are not going to institute world socialism
[01:55:20.920 --> 01:55:23.400]  you know so there's some utopia for them they're going to want to be killing them
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:25.480]  off at the end
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:28.120]  founder of both keepers whether just speaking of yale where you graduated
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:32.440]  top of your class you won that big award for solving the public
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:36.520]  puzzle of enemy combatants status where you predicted in 2004
[01:55:36.520 --> 01:55:40.600]  a lot of what's now actually happened like drone strikes
[01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:44.280]  like drone strikes and now it's here you saw it coming
[01:55:44.280 --> 01:55:48.360]  what will come what will america be like if we don't fully mobilize
[01:55:48.360 --> 01:55:51.960]  get prepared to be the leadership in our area across between
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:57.800]  it off hitlers nazi germany stasi east germany and Stalinist russia
[01:55:57.800 --> 01:56:00.760]  so totalitarian yeah that's their plan right
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:05.240]  absolutely so we have to realize like pat patrick henry said
[01:56:05.240 --> 01:56:08.600]  you know realize the truth never hard it may be
[01:56:08.600 --> 01:56:12.360]  and then it can then provide for it recognize where you're really at and
[01:56:12.360 --> 01:56:15.480]  then get ready to take care of it and notice how their war gaming is now
[01:56:15.480 --> 01:56:19.240]  playing out five years ago tea party number one enemy returning veterans in
[01:56:19.240 --> 01:56:21.400]  the fetters ron paul they're the enemy get them
[01:56:21.400 --> 01:56:24.760]  oath keepers alex Jones they're the enemy get them because we're the only
[01:56:24.760 --> 01:56:28.120]  opposition and now obama is it's gone from tea party
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:31.080]  doesn't have any power the real tea party not the neocon version
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:34.600]  that takeover failed now the real tea party is taken over the house
[01:56:34.600 --> 01:56:37.800]  may take over the senate they're scared and they're actually ringing the alarm
[01:56:37.800 --> 01:56:42.200]  bell now saying we they are powerful and they're they're they're blocking our
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:45.960]  utopia and notice how they always talk about democracy
[01:56:45.960 --> 01:56:49.240]  but when your elected representatives are blocking what they want to do
[01:56:49.240 --> 01:56:52.760]  all of a sudden now now the president has to go around congress he has to wage
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:56.200]  war without congress he has to impose obama care without
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:56:59.480]  congress he has to stop the shutdown without congress etc
[01:56:59.480 --> 01:57:02.920]  now it's like we want a dictatorship because he's right a dictatorship or
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:06.040]  the proletariat amazing i want to come back the next
[01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:09.720]  hour and give the phone number off for veterans currently serving or
[01:57:09.720 --> 01:57:13.800]  uh active duty we can also be reserved for any questions for steward or any
[01:57:13.800 --> 01:57:18.040]  comments you want to make about how awake the guardians of the republic are
[01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:21.080]  but i i mean i gotta tell you it's very heartening to see the military really
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:24.200]  waking up one special warfare soldier told us he
[01:57:24.200 --> 01:57:29.160]  believed that in his unit it was half others have said it's more like 75 percent
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:32.840]  and even the rank and file it's about 30 percent of your average infantryman now
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:36.200]  is paying attention what's going on and tell folks what a three percenter is
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:39.800]  a three percenter is a hardcore gun owner who is not going to back off
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:43.800]  who is not going to comply with any more gun laws and that that movement started
[01:57:43.800 --> 01:57:46.200]  by mike vanderboe has grown and grown and grown
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:49.080]  and in fact um a lot of military where's that patch now
[01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:52.680]  absolutely you'll see you'll see uh outside the wire in afghanistan you'll
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:57:56.200]  see an oath keeper tab and also a three percenter tab
[01:57:56.200 --> 01:58:00.440]  and gave an upcoming rally in uh down in at the alamos coming up
[01:58:00.440 --> 01:58:04.200]  this next weekend on the 19th is going to be an open carry texas rally
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:08.520]  and we think we'd be at least 600 people show up there with long arms
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:12.280]  they had the police chief say he's going to arrest folks if they show up
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:15.160]  um but now he's talking to the other side of his mouth saying he'll give a one
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:19.240]  day reprieve for this rally so we'll see what happens but regardless we're
[01:58:19.240 --> 01:58:22.920]  going to be there but again there's no law
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:25.720]  there we checked it we talked to the land commissioner lawful
[01:58:25.720 --> 01:58:28.840]  so the police chief says he's going to break the law and now he's starting to
[01:58:28.840 --> 01:58:31.160]  back off hopefully he'll back off we don't want
[01:58:31.160 --> 01:58:34.600]  another lexicon or concord to start do we or alamo
[01:58:34.600 --> 01:58:38.760]  we'll be right back stay there we gotta go to break

[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:38.200]  thing because uh we talked to the land commissioner who said look it's
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:41.640]  number one it's the law that you're allowed to have guns open carry
[02:00:41.640 --> 02:00:45.000]  but number two that's state property so they can have their guns on the alamo
[02:00:45.000 --> 02:00:48.040]  and he's the land commissioner it's over that and the police chief is like
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:51.560]  going back and forth but it just shows how out of control things are
[02:00:51.560 --> 02:00:54.040]  jacari jackson did an interview with him it aired the other night we should
[02:00:54.040 --> 02:00:57.880]  probably air that we'll air that tomorrow david night's doing the radio show
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:00.840]  tomorrow so i want to air that land commissioner interview is just a big
[02:01:00.840 --> 02:01:03.640]  deal tomorrow and some of the special reports when david
[02:01:03.640 --> 02:01:06.520]  night's here but stewart getting into what you're saying behind the scenes
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:09.960]  about oath keepers is decentralized perfectly designed just like the
[02:01:09.960 --> 02:01:13.720]  founders to be ideas those are bulletproof they can come
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:15.960]  after you but they can't shut down the signal
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:19.880]  well we want our guys to form these teams as a working model
[02:01:19.880 --> 02:01:23.240]  and then to go out there and also is training cadre but it's not that we
[02:01:23.240 --> 02:01:25.560]  want everyone to join oath keepers to form a team
[02:01:25.560 --> 02:01:29.080]  we want our guys lead by example and help others form their own teams in
[02:01:29.080 --> 02:01:31.880]  neighborhood watches in veterans halls and churches
[02:01:31.880 --> 02:01:34.760]  just you don't even have to even talk to us just go on our website
[02:01:34.760 --> 02:01:38.440]  we'll post all the information about how to do it all the sops or make it
[02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:41.960]  recommended equipment lists things like that and training goals and just run
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.320]  with it if you want our advice contact us and we'll help you out we'll help you
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:48.360]  do it that way it's decentralized it's from the people themselves
[02:01:48.360 --> 02:01:52.280]  ground up it's not some select group of war explain the a team model well the
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:54.440]  a team model is from the special forces a team
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:57.240]  where you have two specialists in each category
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:02:00.040]  on the team like two medics two communications experts
[02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:03.000]  two engineers which are things you need out there in the field
[02:02:03.000 --> 02:02:06.600]  so if one is hurt or killed you still have another one
[02:02:06.600 --> 02:02:09.640]  and what we're doing is saying force multiplication you bet and but their main
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:13.240]  goal ss main mission is not direct action it's to go out there and teach
[02:02:13.240 --> 02:02:16.120]  to go out and teach other people how to take care of themselves and how to
[02:02:16.120 --> 02:02:18.600]  overthrow the oppressor you know depressively bear
[02:02:18.600 --> 02:02:21.560]  so we're taking that model and saying we want to apply the same model and
[02:02:21.560 --> 02:02:24.840]  adapt it to our communities what do we need in every every town and
[02:02:24.840 --> 02:02:28.040]  neighborhood you cannot improvise communications either you got it or you
[02:02:28.040 --> 02:02:30.280]  don't you got radios or you don't it's really
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:33.960]  difficult to me to improvise medical care and same goes for emergency power
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:37.640]  like like generators and solar power either you got it or you don't so put
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:41.720]  those critical things in place and security element to protect them and
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:44.440]  that's the nucleus so even if your neighbors are asleep and not paying
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:48.440]  attention now when the crap hits the fan you are there as a unit ready to
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:51.560]  lead them most guys got guns especially here in texas
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:55.000]  or rural rural montana the parts of the country they have firearms but they
[02:02:55.000 --> 02:02:58.280]  don't have those other critical infrastructure elements so put those in
[02:02:58.280 --> 02:03:01.640]  place and notice the globalists have done everything they can to phase that
[02:03:01.640 --> 02:03:04.600]  out because they understand that's key if you're not
[02:03:04.600 --> 02:03:07.400]  self-sufficient you're domesticated they win
[02:03:07.400 --> 02:03:11.560]  and i studied basic history and ran into the french resistance model and then
[02:03:11.560 --> 02:03:14.120]  and then some of the northern european models of total resistance
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:17.800]  read the book total resistance out of a lot of that well out of the founders
[02:03:17.800 --> 02:03:22.280]  you know the a team model i've used that information warfare with the truth
[02:03:22.280 --> 02:03:26.040]  just to try to get others out there as citizen reporters to then teach others
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:29.160]  you can't kill alex jones and shut down the info war now
[02:03:29.160 --> 02:03:32.440]  doesn't work and remember that the founding fathers in their wisdom used
[02:03:32.440 --> 02:03:35.880]  both very open public organizing and their secret
[02:03:35.880 --> 02:03:39.640]  sons of liberty organization they had public militias and town hall meetings
[02:03:39.640 --> 02:03:43.320]  but they also had the sons of liberty we're saying do both be very open and
[02:03:43.320 --> 02:03:46.120]  public about organizing sheriff posse behind a good
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:50.280]  sheriff organizing neighborhood watches getting all your veterans your local vfw
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:52.920]  to stand up together i mean you're already on list guys if you're a
[02:03:52.920 --> 02:03:56.120]  veteran have a public operation to face and then have your secret
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:58.600]  operation if you've got you know you should have
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:04:01.880]  a plan a b and c for your family that should be private
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:05.480]  that's need to know basis only i don't want to know where your safe houses are
[02:04:05.480 --> 02:04:08.680]  or your your second place to go because that's a cell method as well
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:11.640]  right stuff that's individual you know that stuff that's group that's group
[02:04:11.640 --> 02:04:14.920]  you bet that way you can't grab one person and learn the whole operation and
[02:04:14.920 --> 02:04:19.880]  the and the advantage to doing the very public organizing is think about this
[02:04:19.880 --> 02:04:23.880]  what do social needs and tell us the mistake they made in the soviet union
[02:04:23.880 --> 02:04:27.960]  is they all were isolated by themselves hoping the secret police did not come
[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:31.320]  to their door and they were they did not have any mutual aid or mutual self
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:34.520]  defense if you have an organized community it's much
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:37.720]  less likely the secret police will be able to get away with it
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:40.360]  come into your house bottom line we're going to teach people how to take care
[02:04:40.360 --> 02:04:44.360]  of themselves and then resist and we come back that's why the federally run
[02:04:44.360 --> 02:04:47.640]  southern property law center is so scared now we're going to explain the
[02:04:47.640 --> 02:04:50.600]  warning they're putting out when we come back and they should be concerned
[02:04:50.600 --> 02:04:54.200]  the globalist are a criminal takeover arm we are rightfully resisting it

[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:33.240]  they're in control of unlimited blood supply as you said but we have
[02:09:33.240 --> 02:09:37.640]  the right and if we're on the side of good and we continue to point that out
[02:09:37.640 --> 02:09:41.480]  it's over for them steward breaking news at drudgerport.com
[02:09:41.480 --> 02:09:46.120]  this is in the news articles that are coming out white house and irs exchange
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:50.280]  confidential taxpayer info now that's been known for a while but now it's
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:54.520]  coming out the white house tried to deny it again this is beyond nixon and now
[02:09:54.520 --> 02:09:57.080]  under obama care it gives them all your medical
[02:09:57.080 --> 02:10:00.440]  data i mean how much of this will we put up with but you were talking about
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:04.840]  during the break letting the illegals come and protest but arresting veterans
[02:10:04.840 --> 02:10:08.600]  if they try to go see the world war two memorials now they're shutting down most
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:12.600]  of arlington cemetery knowing people were pre-booked to go visit their loved
[02:10:12.600 --> 02:10:15.800]  ones what's next the two men unknown soldier be unguarded for the first time
[02:10:15.800 --> 02:10:19.480]  in this history so who knows i mean but the more they do this actually i think
[02:10:19.480 --> 02:10:23.080]  it's great because there's there's showing everyone how absurd it is
[02:10:23.080 --> 02:10:26.920]  and how orwellian they've become the masses coming off and through their own
[02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:30.840]  arrogance they don't realize what they're doing i want them to piss off every
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:35.400]  american veteran and every active duty military the more they act like
[02:10:35.400 --> 02:10:39.560]  jackasses towards the military and the veterans the better but she went to
[02:10:39.560 --> 02:10:43.880]  Yale you as a law student and as a graduate and rub elbows with these guys
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:46.520]  they don't understand the military culture they are arrogant i mean they
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:49.800]  really think they're all powerful they do not understand the military they do
[02:10:49.800 --> 02:10:53.480]  not understand where they come from they don't understand traditional americans
[02:10:53.480 --> 02:10:58.120]  it's like they're they're autistic they're brilliant on paper and you know
[02:10:58.120 --> 02:11:02.360]  and in certain ways but when it comes to common sense they they don't have it
[02:11:02.360 --> 02:11:06.360]  they do not have it and they're blind to what they're doing why in multiple
[02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:11.160]  parks would they lock people down in the hotel say you can't leave for days
[02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:15.160]  pull guns on foreigners pulling up in buses to see that you know to see
[02:11:15.160 --> 02:11:18.760]  Yosemite or or Yellowstone i mean it's they're crazy
[02:11:18.760 --> 02:11:23.080]  on their power trip yeah well they're trying to you know magnify and amplify
[02:11:23.080 --> 02:11:26.360]  that the shutdown to say oh look how horrible it is but they're what they're
[02:11:26.360 --> 02:11:30.520]  really doing is pissing people off people know it's it's it's bull they're
[02:11:30.520 --> 02:11:33.880]  now giving tickets to people that show up at the Grand Canyon that cbs news
[02:11:33.880 --> 02:11:38.040]  right and so folks know it's nonsense so the more they do this we are if they
[02:11:38.040 --> 02:11:42.440]  keep acting like this we will reach the 90% that they had an east germany who
[02:11:42.440 --> 02:11:46.920]  are aware of how illegitimate and evil the regime was i hope they keep doing
[02:11:46.920 --> 02:11:50.120]  this i hope to send it signs that ridiculous un treaty
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:53.720]  i mean the more they do this the easier it is for us to wake people up
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:57.720]  it's becoming easier and easier we've had guys who two years ago wouldn't
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:01.960]  listen to us in the veterans hall walking up to us now and apologizing saying
[02:12:01.960 --> 02:12:05.720]  i'm sorry to listen to you you were right and now they're ready to take
[02:12:05.720 --> 02:12:09.720]  action so the more they do this the easier it is for us to wake people up
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:13.000]  but we have to make sure that they actually do something rather than just
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:16.600]  look around and go this is bad well look at how seven obamas ours
[02:12:16.600 --> 02:12:20.600]  have have said they love mouse a ton the greatest mass murderer in history
[02:12:20.600 --> 02:12:24.600]  i mean these people and when you listen to them talk they can barely talk and
[02:12:24.600 --> 02:12:29.320]  they're all crusty looking and weird and and just corrupt but
[02:12:29.320 --> 02:12:32.520]  everybody just follows their orders i mean these are really a bunch of freaks
[02:12:32.520 --> 02:12:36.360]  well everybody in their circle that's why they they they only see the
[02:12:36.360 --> 02:12:39.640]  reflection of their own echo chamber and so they think that everyone do what
[02:12:39.640 --> 02:12:43.320]  they're told they believe like like Kissinger said that all the military
[02:12:43.320 --> 02:12:46.760]  are just useless dumb animals do what they're told but we know different
[02:12:46.760 --> 02:12:49.880]  and we know from history that that's not the way it's going to go well here's
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:52.440]  the difference they may get poor people and all the rest of it but a lot of
[02:12:52.440 --> 02:12:55.640]  folks join because of family and history the military and there's a few
[02:12:55.640 --> 02:12:58.680]  joins they like to kill people but overall they're great folks and i've
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:01.800]  learned out of anybody in the culture the reason the system hates
[02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:04.440]  military vets is they've had to live in the real world
[02:13:04.440 --> 02:13:07.640]  they know the government lies to them they know they're giving bad vaccines
[02:13:07.640 --> 02:13:09.880]  they know they get financially lied to and cheated
[02:13:09.880 --> 02:13:13.880]  they know the corrupt stuff that goes on and they have been in the real world
[02:13:13.880 --> 02:13:18.040]  and are not afraid to fight back and so of course these ivory towered
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:21.960]  cowards hate them they hate anybody that's real anybody that's
[02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:25.640]  experienced anything they're scared of you and they're not eunuchs and they're
[02:13:25.640 --> 02:13:28.840]  not eloy for the molocks they are people with
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:33.400]  courage and as you said earlier what they want is a hyper militarized
[02:13:33.400 --> 02:13:37.320]  hyper masculine state and they want a sheeple
[02:13:37.320 --> 02:13:40.280]  and the only other people in society they want to have that are
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:43.240]  you know masculine or able to take care of themselves would be the be the
[02:13:43.240 --> 02:13:46.920]  hyper criminals so that the military does and all the veterans
[02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:49.560]  is throws a monkey wrench in that they are not
[02:13:49.560 --> 02:13:53.240]  emaciated they are not sheeple these are people who are can think for
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:56.280]  themselves and act on their own when they know what's right and they have
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:13:59.160]  courage the most bottom line essential thing you must have is
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:03.000]  courage as Aristotle said courage is the first virtue
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:07.560]  because without courage knowledge wisdom doesn't matter if you don't have
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.240]  courage you will submit to all new tyrannies and make excuses for it
[02:14:11.240 --> 02:14:15.080]  until we have the video of austin yesterday 14 out of 20
[02:14:15.080 --> 02:14:18.920]  signed a petition to make everyone wear helmets when they leave their house
[02:14:18.920 --> 02:14:22.280]  absolutely the courage is the first virtue and we have that but what they
[02:14:22.280 --> 02:14:25.480]  will do what they can do is what they did during Katrina
[02:14:25.480 --> 02:14:29.160]  when you have a disaster that was the robust that was the test in Katrina
[02:14:29.160 --> 02:14:32.520]  because they were it was seen as a real emergency by the troops you had
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:36.520]  active duty military obeying orders to go and confiscate firearms
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:40.360]  part out of ignorance but also because they perceived it as a real emergency
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:43.160]  that's why it's critical for folks to get squared away in their communities
[02:14:43.160 --> 02:14:47.160]  so it's no longer a real emergency they remove the pretext you can weather
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:51.160]  any storm on your own you don't need martial law to make you safe
[02:14:51.160 --> 02:14:54.760]  well plus it did backfire they passed a law saying the feds can't do that
[02:14:54.760 --> 02:14:58.360]  there was already laws on the books but you later learned there were units that
[02:14:58.360 --> 02:15:01.720]  did actually stand down and say no there were some yes but the point is it
[02:15:01.720 --> 02:15:04.440]  wasn't about stopping looters that was the police mainly
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:08.040]  it was actually going into the rich areas and stealing their guns right and so
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:11.320]  the the point is those are fleshed in human nature that the more dire the
[02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:14.760]  emergency the more unprepared the people the more likely it is that the
[02:15:14.760 --> 02:15:18.360]  military and police will obey the orders and the more likely your neighbors
[02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:21.240]  will submit to it because they want the food they feel they feel
[02:15:21.240 --> 02:15:24.680]  so it's essential to learn how to skin a buck run a trot line have
[02:15:24.680 --> 02:15:27.480]  swarable food firearms and communications and know your neighbors
[02:15:27.480 --> 02:15:31.320]  a country boy can't survive that's right and an american can't survive
[02:15:31.320 --> 02:15:34.840]  be a real american a real american to sit on the couch because you can't starve
[02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:38.280]  them out and you can't make them run that's right that's the answer
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:41.800]  can't starve us out can't make us run that's it you want security and you
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:45.160]  want food security physical security to defend yourselves in each other
[02:15:45.160 --> 02:15:48.840]  this was the this was the founder's model they grew their own food they were
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:51.560]  independent farmers they were all in the militia
[02:15:51.560 --> 02:15:55.160]  you could not use the militia to oppress the people and they'd all been in a
[02:15:55.160 --> 02:15:57.800]  bunch of real wars so you couldn't push them around
[02:15:57.800 --> 02:16:00.520]  right they they fought the french indians on the frontier for hundreds of
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:04.520]  years that is who king george pissed off
[02:16:04.520 --> 02:16:08.040]  wasn't the wasn't the boston merchants who were dangerous
[02:16:08.040 --> 02:16:11.800]  it was the folks out in the countryside who were far more radical than even the
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:14.840]  bostonians were they had no idea what they were doing
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:17.960]  they thought they were dealing only with sam adams and and and john hancock a
[02:16:17.960 --> 02:16:20.360]  rich merchant they thought they were a pain in the neck
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:23.880]  then when they pissed off the townspeople out in the rural areas by
[02:16:23.880 --> 02:16:27.320]  banning town hall meetings that's when they really woke the sleeping
[02:16:27.320 --> 02:16:30.520]  giant up and the same thing's going to happen here in this country you know
[02:16:30.520 --> 02:16:34.440]  it's not what you and i say it's the guy down the road
[02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:38.040]  who's been a world war two vet or korean war veteran
[02:16:38.040 --> 02:16:41.560]  vietnam vet his whole family's been military he was a veteran
[02:16:41.560 --> 02:16:44.920]  that's the guy and when he pulls up at a checkpoint where they're taking guns
[02:16:44.920 --> 02:16:48.520]  all bets are off and pretty soon there won't be any more of those checkpoints
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:52.120]  yeah that's right so there's there's and if he organizes all the other veterans
[02:16:52.120 --> 02:16:55.400]  and all the other gun owners in his county in particular and they get behind
[02:16:55.400 --> 02:16:58.200]  a good sheriff with a posse behind a sheriff it can't be done
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:02.360]  that in that under those circumstances the tsa of viper squads won't be able to
[02:17:02.360 --> 02:17:05.000]  do any tell us about the southern barbie law center now they're they're calling
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:07.400]  you the fifth column well in their comments they've got some
[02:17:07.400 --> 02:17:10.680]  readers saying we're a fifth column and we're gonna we're planning to take over
[02:17:10.680 --> 02:17:13.960]  but of course the absurdity of that is is what we want is want every we want
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:17.560]  america and the republic back they've taken over exactly and we want every
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:20.440]  america to be trained we don't want us to be the warrior class
[02:17:20.440 --> 02:17:24.360]  that's not i don't want no that's the opposite you're the opposite of them
[02:17:24.360 --> 02:17:28.280]  exactly they want to be the commasars and everybody else is peeling slaves
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:31.720]  they want the hyper warrior class to be under their control only and as you
[02:17:31.720 --> 02:17:35.160]  said they're the commasars but they don't want is they don't want independent
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:39.480]  resilient americans who raise their own children who grow their own food who
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:42.840]  have their own raw milk they don't want that and take care of their own security
[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:45.240]  you know what's amazing i'm gonna skip this network break so we can go to all
[02:17:45.240 --> 02:17:47.320]  these calls for our next guest comes up i'm gonna have you
[02:17:47.320 --> 02:17:51.880]  with us as well and toss chumlee uh plumbly joins us
[02:17:51.880 --> 02:17:55.560]  said chumlee thinking of the guy from pond stars man he's like to watch a show
[02:17:55.560 --> 02:18:00.440]  the point is is that you can feel the history happening i mean this is not a
[02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:02.760]  game and now i've i've always known they were
[02:18:02.760 --> 02:18:05.320]  tyrants but now i realize they're really the worst brand
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:08.760]  i mean we're really dealing with evil and it's almost empowering to know we've
[02:18:08.760 --> 02:18:11.400]  been right and to know that nothing's going to stop these trains going
[02:18:11.400 --> 02:18:14.440]  together this is the way it is yeah and and i'm just
[02:18:14.440 --> 02:18:17.960]  honored to be alive in a generation that gets to be in the real fight to decide
[02:18:17.960 --> 02:18:22.920]  the whole next cycle of human development because this is it yep embrace the suck
[02:18:22.920 --> 02:18:26.920]  recognize your place in history you were born here at this time
[02:18:26.920 --> 02:18:30.760]  as an american for a reason and it's not to live on your knees
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:34.520]  it's not to have google glasses and be a trendy and dance around them and you
[02:18:34.520 --> 02:18:38.040]  know die young from fluoride i mean it's i i mean it's not
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:42.120]  just to watch tv and nfl all day right i mean that's not what this is about
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:45.640]  or take your chains leave your children in chains so it's time for us to realize
[02:18:45.640 --> 02:18:49.320]  our place in history and and embrace it you know what do you think of the austin
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:53.320]  i'm signing a petition for obama uh that everyone
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:55.480]  have to wear a helmet when they walk down the street
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:18:58.520]  that's not real texas i don't know what that is but ain't texas
[02:18:58.520 --> 02:19:03.000]  so that's austin well that it doesn't have voting we've proven it's fraudulent
[02:19:03.000 --> 02:19:05.720]  run by a criminal group i mean i had it certified at the state level and they
[02:19:05.720 --> 02:19:08.600]  said that doesn't matter right but no these are the
[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:13.160]  trendies in the ut sector and they believe they run the city
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:17.000]  but it's true that right outside austin people would laugh at you about this
[02:19:17.000 --> 02:19:20.520]  but i'm telling you i don't know what you call these people
[02:19:20.520 --> 02:19:25.480]  i mean they it is they're eloy describe the eloy on the moorlox
[02:19:25.480 --> 02:19:28.520]  right from the time machine there were the eloy who were basically food for
[02:19:28.520 --> 02:19:31.320]  the moorlox they were they were raised to be cattle
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:35.400]  and they were submissive a subservient did not even help each other out
[02:19:35.400 --> 02:19:38.440]  and didn't know how to resist that's what these people are they're willing
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:43.720]  were their their self um self actualized eloy they turned themselves into eloy
[02:19:43.720 --> 02:19:47.000]  and they think it's a virtue if you really talk to them later they'll
[02:19:47.000 --> 02:19:49.480]  admit they know what's wrong they go doesn't matter i'm on the winning team
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:54.040]  if i submit i will succeed and it's like no that it isn't working like that
[02:19:54.040 --> 02:19:58.600]  yeah they love big brother so but as i said earlier they're useful idiots
[02:19:58.600 --> 02:20:01.960]  in the end the powers that be don't care about them either
[02:20:01.960 --> 02:20:05.080]  briefly the alamo situation coming up and then we're gonna go to the calls
[02:20:05.080 --> 02:20:09.960]  well we had a march in temple texas for open carry in support of the active
[02:20:09.960 --> 02:20:13.800]  duty soldier who was detained while he was open carrying out with his son
[02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:16.760]  mr grisham sergeant grisham you just had dinner with them didn't you
[02:20:16.760 --> 02:20:19.320]  uh we we missed dinner unfortunately but probably tonight
[02:20:19.320 --> 02:20:23.000]  but we were we went there it was open carry of texas put the march on an
[02:20:23.000 --> 02:20:26.360]  oathkeeper supported it so we were there for that one and we're going to the
[02:20:26.360 --> 02:20:29.960]  one next weekend on the 19th at the alamo same thing
[02:20:29.960 --> 02:20:33.160]  open carry of a long arm in texas is legal
[02:20:33.160 --> 02:20:36.440]  and what is the better place to go with but at the alamo
[02:20:36.440 --> 02:20:40.600]  the whole issue there was the refusal to submit the refusal to turn in their
[02:20:40.600 --> 02:20:43.160]  guns and as you see right here in his coffee cup
[02:20:43.160 --> 02:20:46.440]  you've got you've got criminal travis saying victor your death i will she'll
[02:20:46.440 --> 02:20:49.400]  never surrender or retreat and that's the mindset we have to have as
[02:20:49.400 --> 02:20:52.920]  americans we're going there to honor americans from lexington green
[02:20:52.920 --> 02:20:56.760]  through the alamo who've taken the same stand and in that same spirit
[02:20:56.760 --> 02:21:00.840]  take our city our stand and draw our line in the sand and say we are not going
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:04.600]  to submit to being disarmed by the way he knew five six seven
[02:21:04.600 --> 02:21:07.240]  thousand soldiers were coming for their hundred and eighty something
[02:21:07.240 --> 02:21:10.120]  why did they make the decision to do that because they've been ordered to go
[02:21:10.120 --> 02:21:13.800]  down there they were committed to it and they were men of destiny we need to
[02:21:13.800 --> 02:21:17.720]  become men of destiny again they knew that they were going to light the fire
[02:21:17.720 --> 02:21:21.800]  that would lead to the independence of the republic of texas and they did
[02:21:21.800 --> 02:21:24.200]  they knew it and they were willing to pay that price
[02:21:24.200 --> 02:21:27.960]  sometimes it's worth paying the price that's completely different from the
[02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:30.840]  they are the diametrically the opposite of those trendies
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:34.280]  180 degrees right absolutely the trendies and
[02:21:34.280 --> 02:21:37.560]  that their their view is anything to save my skin
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:42.360]  to preserve my safety all that matters is me and for for men like this minister
[02:21:42.360 --> 02:21:44.680]  lexington the men who assaulted the beaches at
[02:21:44.680 --> 02:21:48.920]  iwo jima and normandy it was exactly the opposite
[02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:53.320]  they were throwing themselves on the front lines to save their country
[02:21:53.320 --> 02:21:56.280]  and they believed to fight for freedom not always that's how it's gone
[02:21:56.280 --> 02:21:59.560]  throughout history and that's why the enemy demonizes the patriots because
[02:21:59.560 --> 02:22:03.560]  they know we're the threat to their total takeover right of our children
[02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:07.960]  everything unbelievable uh let's go to renais and louisiana then chad woody
[02:22:07.960 --> 02:22:10.920]  john and pete thanks for holding renais you're on the air from louisiana you're
[02:22:10.920 --> 02:22:13.720]  a marine go ahead
[02:22:14.760 --> 02:22:19.720]  you're on the air renais go ahead okay put renais on hold or let them go let's go
[02:22:19.720 --> 02:22:24.760]  to woody uh go ahead you're on the air woody
[02:22:24.760 --> 02:22:29.400]  yes hi i like how are you today i'm fine go ahead
[02:22:29.400 --> 02:22:34.600]  okay uh mr rose i read your uh your call basically what sounds like a call to
[02:22:34.600 --> 02:22:38.920]  arms in america and retired law enforcement with with family
[02:22:38.920 --> 02:22:43.640]  and military and my oldest son we did a tour in iraq in afghanistan
[02:22:43.640 --> 02:22:48.920]  uh he's now out of the service don't you think with the nsa spying apparatus
[02:22:48.920 --> 02:22:54.360]  in the uh police state that's now in place that if
[02:22:54.360 --> 02:22:59.400]  oathkeepers does organize like this that they'll be the first ones to be
[02:22:59.400 --> 02:23:03.480]  targeted to be you know subjects under the national
[02:23:03.480 --> 02:23:07.800]  defense authorization act yeah potentially but i think by then
[02:23:07.800 --> 02:23:12.280]  it's too late we'll have spread the good virus so we want our guys to go out
[02:23:12.280 --> 02:23:15.000]  there they're already on a list if you're an oathkeeper member you're on a
[02:23:15.000 --> 02:23:18.520]  list already so why not go out and replicate yourself
[02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:22.680]  the enemy putting patriots on list shows they're an occupying enemy
[02:23:22.680 --> 02:23:26.680]  right this is not the government but the utility of it is is i want to go
[02:23:26.680 --> 02:23:30.520]  replicate my skills and somebody else if i'm afraid to go teach another
[02:23:30.520 --> 02:23:34.360]  american what i know how to do which was reconnaissance patrolling
[02:23:34.360 --> 02:23:37.800]  or whatever your mos was if you're afraid to do that they win
[02:23:37.800 --> 02:23:40.920]  you don't pass on those skills you don't organize your fellow americans
[02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:43.880]  see yourself if you want to see yourself as i'm being on a like a comic
[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:46.360]  cozy mission that's that's fine no no you're a seed
[02:23:46.360 --> 02:23:49.640]  yeah i'm i'm sending i'm going out there to plant the seed as a like like an
[02:23:49.640 --> 02:23:53.880]  sf-a team they might be rounded up and killed but but by
[02:23:53.880 --> 02:23:57.160]  the time that happens they'll have already organized the population it's
[02:23:57.160 --> 02:23:59.880]  already too late to stop plus more than even training people you're teaching
[02:23:59.880 --> 02:24:03.480]  them that they can resist well sure once people start thinking of that they're
[02:24:03.480 --> 02:24:06.520]  going to figure out their ways as well and you're not going to have security
[02:24:06.520 --> 02:24:09.960]  look guys a secret cell structure is not going to stop
[02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:12.760]  the secret police from getting you in the middle of the night but if you
[02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:15.880]  organize your entire neighborhood and all the veterans your town
[02:24:15.880 --> 02:24:19.400]  now the secret police can no longer well by the way i mean i'm no military guy
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:21.960]  but i've studied it if they start rounding people up you don't wait in
[02:24:21.960 --> 02:24:25.320]  your houses you go out right then the defense is offense
[02:24:25.320 --> 02:24:28.280]  you're not you're not you go on the offense the minute they start rounding
[02:24:28.280 --> 02:24:31.240]  people up in the worst case i mean look here just to back up a second
[02:24:31.240 --> 02:24:34.520]  this is what americans are supposed to be doing anyway the founders told us that
[02:24:34.520 --> 02:24:38.600]  we have a responsibility to take our protection and our national security in
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:41.480]  our own hands as a militia that's why it says in second
[02:24:41.480 --> 02:24:44.520]  amendment is necessary for security or free state
[02:24:44.520 --> 02:24:47.640]  you will not be free and you will not be secure without it
[02:24:47.640 --> 02:24:51.080]  a secret cell structure is not going to help you when looters come rolling over
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:53.880]  your your house and and and burn you out and
[02:24:53.880 --> 02:24:56.840]  kill you a secret cells also not going to stop the secret police
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:59.720]  so it does not provide from neighborhood security it does not provide
[02:24:59.720 --> 02:25:03.720]  for your neighbors to be secure so they don't the answer is we're the good guys
[02:25:03.720 --> 02:25:06.920]  we're out in the open we're the americans against the occupier
[02:25:06.920 --> 02:25:10.120]  well even if you're talking about a worst case scenario
[02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:14.440]  but the utility of it is as the founders did with it with the open militias
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:17.400]  as it forces them to try to bring out the standing army
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:20.200]  and that's why the open carry is so important because they already taught
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:22.920]  people guns were illegal the average idiot thinks they're illegal
[02:25:22.920 --> 02:25:26.440]  the open carry lets them know no it's okay to have guns and now the guns are
[02:25:26.440 --> 02:25:28.520]  back in the racks of the pickup trucks again
[02:25:28.520 --> 02:25:31.400]  right we're now this is true civil rights movement god bless you sir i
[02:25:31.400 --> 02:25:34.840]  appreciate your call let's go to chad in minnesota you're
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:39.880]  on the air afghan vet go ahead hey alex uh i appreciate everything you guys are
[02:25:39.880 --> 02:25:41.800]  doing i just want to let you know you know i
[02:25:41.800 --> 02:25:45.000]  we need our country back that's for sure this is just ridiculous
[02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:49.320]  um things are out of hand i'm an 11 bravo infantry soldiers over in afghanistan
[02:25:49.320 --> 02:25:52.760]  and things are just out of hand it's just ridiculous
[02:25:52.760 --> 02:25:55.960]  um well that's the key the globalists aren't going to just back off either
[02:25:55.960 --> 02:25:59.240]  they're not going to move slow anymore they know we're winning the info war
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:02.280]  they're trying to move it into the next phase go ahead
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:05.720]  and i you know i'll let you know that i'm not i'm not going to sit back and
[02:26:05.720 --> 02:26:08.200]  stand you don't stand for it if they want to come to my
[02:26:08.200 --> 02:26:11.400]  my door and take my weapon they can take it off a pile of brass of my dead body
[02:26:11.400 --> 02:26:15.000]  afterwards so you know completely fine with me i'll
[02:26:15.000 --> 02:26:18.600]  i'll rally all my friends and neighbors and i was born you know and raised by
[02:26:18.600 --> 02:26:21.320]  my father who was a jack of all trades because i tell you what our biggest
[02:26:21.320 --> 02:26:23.880]  problem in this country is everybody only knows one thing
[02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:27.080]  right that's what you were saying to me last night uh steward
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:30.840]  is the key is that we all need to be generalists we need to
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:35.000]  have full spectrum understanding of basics every american should be have
[02:26:35.000 --> 02:26:38.360]  light infantry skills and and you could specialize in one thing like an
[02:26:38.360 --> 02:26:41.160]  on sf-18 but then you should cross train he's right you should be able to take
[02:26:41.160 --> 02:26:45.000]  care of yourself and your family as as highland said specializations for
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:47.320]  insects
[02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:50.840]  it was an eagle scout and we were raised through you know
[02:26:50.840 --> 02:26:54.200]  going through the woods knowing how to take care of yourself we go hunting we
[02:26:54.200 --> 02:26:56.920]  go fishing if it comes down to a we can survive you
[02:26:56.920 --> 02:26:59.720]  know and that's the biggest thing but most people are too afraid
[02:26:59.720 --> 02:27:03.160]  passive passive skills on their lives and they just want to sit there and watch
[02:27:03.160 --> 02:27:07.160]  their tv and watch yeah they think being wimpy it protects them
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:10.840]  when it's the opposite it's just it's it's totally backwards and pass those
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:13.160]  skills on and like i said before the founders use
[02:27:13.160 --> 02:27:16.600]  both they use very public organization and they also had the sons of liberty
[02:27:16.600 --> 02:27:20.600]  it's a yin and yang thing use them both but don't fool yourself into thinking
[02:27:20.600 --> 02:27:24.360]  you guys out there that by being silent and waiting for the day that you're
[02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:27.720]  getting things done organized right now get your that's right if you won't get
[02:27:27.720 --> 02:27:31.400]  involved in the info war you'll never physically fight
[02:27:31.400 --> 02:27:34.520]  i know some guys who are off the radar because they're combat vets and that's
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:37.400]  a that's a different ball game you know but if you're not unless you're one of
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:40.840]  them then you better be doing something very publicly
[02:27:40.840 --> 02:27:44.600]  we need everybody to be public i we need people to get aggressive right now
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:47.000]  right that's the only thing that's going to save us is back on these crooks
[02:27:47.000 --> 02:27:50.520]  off because they're watching they're testing and and we fail the test they're
[02:27:50.520 --> 02:27:53.400]  going to blow stuff up and blame it on us they're going to come after us and all
[02:27:53.400 --> 02:27:56.520]  hell's going to break loose and by the way the police out there i'm not
[02:27:56.520 --> 02:27:59.720]  spoiling for some fight me and my kids aren't going to one of your dungeons
[02:27:59.720 --> 02:28:02.600]  and let me explain something you don't want to be in the civil war the
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:05.880]  globalist plan to wipe you out in the first year of this war
[02:28:05.880 --> 02:28:09.080]  that that is the plan is to have us kill each other so we need to get that
[02:28:09.080 --> 02:28:12.360]  message out to police do not go out and round up people for their political
[02:28:12.360 --> 02:28:15.560]  views right your your children are going to be either
[02:28:15.560 --> 02:28:19.640]  free or slaves also they're not going to be exempt so the police out there
[02:28:19.640 --> 02:28:22.760]  definitely need to choose sides you need to choose you know who you who do you

[02:33:07.480 --> 02:33:13.640]  I'll be honest
[02:33:13.640 --> 02:33:17.240]  crashing through the lies and disinformation
[02:33:17.240 --> 02:33:22.120]  it's alex jones on the GCN radio network
[02:33:22.120 --> 02:33:29.480]  waging war on corruption crashing through the lies and disinformation
[02:33:29.480 --> 02:33:32.600]  look i'll be honest with everybody and i've said this many times but it's
[02:33:32.600 --> 02:33:36.360]  important people understand this just from my perspective constantly living
[02:33:36.360 --> 02:33:38.840]  this studying it going through all the stuff that
[02:33:38.840 --> 02:33:42.360]  happens behind the scenes dealing with this and watching the political process
[02:33:42.360 --> 02:33:46.760]  unfold over 20 years of political action 18 years on air
[02:33:46.760 --> 02:33:49.560]  and immersing myself in historical research as well
[02:33:49.560 --> 02:33:55.560]  not just contemporary research i would not be fighting this is hard and being
[02:33:55.560 --> 02:33:59.800]  as prominent and aggressive if we were dealing with a boss
[02:33:59.800 --> 02:34:02.600]  called corruption of say like a harry truman where there's just some bid
[02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:05.640]  rigging and robbing going on and things like that
[02:34:05.640 --> 02:34:09.160]  the globalists are fundamentally trying to shut down freedom shut down the
[02:34:09.160 --> 02:34:12.920]  family dumb people down they're fundamentally trying to wreck
[02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:17.800]  prosperity they're fundamentally on record doing this to make us impoverished
[02:34:17.800 --> 02:34:22.520]  for social assimilation into a collectivist eugenics-based
[02:34:22.520 --> 02:34:26.440]  planned parenthood nightmare and you can argue and go look at the dumb down
[02:34:26.440 --> 02:34:29.560]  public we need to get rid of these dumb people
[02:34:29.560 --> 02:34:32.920]  but they've helped accentuate that and and they're targeting
[02:34:32.920 --> 02:34:36.760]  the most intelligent people they're targeting leadership males
[02:34:36.760 --> 02:34:39.560]  the government documents have come out that are talking of high test scores
[02:34:39.560 --> 02:34:44.360]  with the drugging and schools this is a military program by the globalist
[02:34:44.360 --> 02:34:47.320]  so the military is now because they have some military training
[02:34:47.320 --> 02:34:50.360]  is going to wait this is a military operation and wait we're targeted when we
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:55.560]  get out they're understanding that there's no making a deal with this
[02:34:55.560 --> 02:34:59.320]  it'd be like if aliens were 50 light years out we're gonna get here in 20
[02:34:59.320 --> 02:35:02.200]  years or whatever they had warp speed and when they get here they're gonna
[02:35:02.200 --> 02:35:05.080]  destroy earth and we have their plans i'm not
[02:35:05.080 --> 02:35:07.720]  gonna like try to make a deal with them when they get here
[02:35:07.720 --> 02:35:12.600]  there that's the analogy there's no making a deal with the new world order
[02:35:12.600 --> 02:35:16.600]  there's no all right all kind of resist it culturally and try to make it better
[02:35:16.600 --> 02:35:20.360]  and then you know i wouldn't be 110 percent all in
[02:35:20.360 --> 02:35:23.480]  just committed really trying to be front and center on their radar
[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:27.400]  just begging for them to come after me if i realized there's no future if we
[02:35:27.400 --> 02:35:30.520]  don't anyways but it's also very liberating to
[02:35:30.520 --> 02:35:34.280]  admit how much trouble we're in because then all you can do is get ready and
[02:35:34.280 --> 02:35:36.920]  deal with it and fight it as hard as you can
[02:35:36.920 --> 02:35:41.240]  that's what life's all about we're meant to prevail we're meant to survive victory
[02:35:41.240 --> 02:35:44.120]  is just survival folks and the globalists understand
[02:35:44.120 --> 02:35:47.000]  that they want the whole future everything for themselves
[02:35:47.000 --> 02:35:50.920]  we're gonna go back to your calls uh Rene and
[02:35:50.920 --> 02:35:56.360]  john and lee and al and bill and everybody we're only got him on for
[02:35:56.360 --> 02:35:59.240]  about 10 minutes just to get an update i appreciate him
[02:35:59.240 --> 02:36:03.320]  coming on headline from julie wilson up on info wars.com
[02:36:03.320 --> 02:36:07.320]  former cie whistleblower targeted by government
[02:36:07.320 --> 02:36:11.880]  for facebook post whistleblower calls out government facebook post gets
[02:36:11.880 --> 02:36:16.280]  threatened by the doj that's the department of justice
[02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:20.920]  and i guess that's via the dod and the point is is that tosh plumley
[02:36:20.920 --> 02:36:27.400]  is a famous whistleblower from uh back in the church hearings in 77 on record
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:32.200]  and the iran contra hearings but he's still at 76 years old
[02:36:32.200 --> 02:36:35.880]  only job he has is a contractor he's a famous contractor flew guns to castrow
[02:36:35.880 --> 02:36:39.160]  when he was working for the u.s then flew guns in after him bay of pigs you name
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:42.680]  it all of it for those that don't know history he's a famous guy folks i know
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:46.120]  who chuck yager is or otty murphy that's just amazing
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:50.200]  but the point is is that he lived it he came on our show so they're gonna come
[02:36:50.200 --> 02:36:54.200]  out from me probably but i talked to a high level nato source and others
[02:36:54.200 --> 02:36:57.320]  it wasn't just the libyan arms they were covering up to al-qaeda
[02:36:57.320 --> 02:37:03.480]  with the ambassador from turkey to syria it was in the legal export but illegal
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:06.120]  to al-qaeda out of the state department giving him
[02:37:06.120 --> 02:37:11.240]  actual modern stairs he's got the doj saying how do you know that
[02:37:11.240 --> 02:37:15.720]  and so uh he's gonna give us an update on what he's dealing with right now
[02:37:15.720 --> 02:37:18.920]  what's happening as a contractor a mercenary in his own words
[02:37:18.920 --> 02:37:22.120]  he's not a mercenary because you know he's he's got these contacts he's
[02:37:22.120 --> 02:37:25.720]  risking his life to do this and as jim garrison said you got to be in the
[02:37:25.720 --> 02:37:29.480]  spotlight or get dead he's also here because once he learned all this he
[02:37:29.480 --> 02:37:32.520]  had to go public or he had a better chance of being killed and from my
[02:37:32.520 --> 02:37:35.320]  research i hadn't been around in the 50s like he was
[02:37:35.320 --> 02:37:38.520]  but in my years of dealing with this stuff he's absolutely right so we'll get
[02:37:38.520 --> 02:37:41.240]  through it roads take on that in a moment as well but uh
[02:37:41.240 --> 02:37:45.400]  tosh plumbly we appreciate your courage uh tell us tell us what you're going
[02:37:45.400 --> 02:37:48.920]  through what's happened uh and the repercussions you've had from coming on
[02:37:48.920 --> 02:37:52.520]  the broadcast okay well thank you alex i've
[02:37:52.520 --> 02:37:56.120]  appreciate you you're welcome to come back on i hope i can
[02:37:56.120 --> 02:38:00.040]  recap this for you in a way where your listeners can understand it
[02:38:00.040 --> 02:38:08.120]  well back in 209 friends of mine uh military or high-ranking officer
[02:38:08.120 --> 02:38:11.720]  was involved with the transports out in mexico
[02:38:11.720 --> 02:38:15.400]  training out the mexican marinos to go in and um
[02:38:15.400 --> 02:38:19.560]  track down um cartel members and um uh
[02:38:19.560 --> 02:38:23.640]  to stop some of those activities uh that was an article that was done called
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:26.920]  boots on the ground by bill connolly and also news
[02:38:26.920 --> 02:38:32.440]  uh that went to 209 the fast and furious thing got called up in it
[02:38:32.440 --> 02:38:36.520]  we began to find out weapons that were coming to legally not illegally
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:39.480]  but legally from the direct commercial sales program
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:42.680]  they're showing up in crime scenes in mexico
[02:38:42.680 --> 02:38:45.880]  um these were not always coming from mom
[02:38:45.880 --> 02:38:49.880]  uh mom and pops uh gun stores these were an aircraft gun
[02:38:49.880 --> 02:38:54.600]  finger missiles rpg i went in with transports down there and the marinos
[02:38:54.600 --> 02:39:00.520]  went past four seven um and photographed some of the
[02:39:00.520 --> 02:39:04.760]  weapons reported back to proper authorities while we were finding
[02:39:04.760 --> 02:39:10.280]  and we got so well um so the reason that i was contacted down there is because
[02:39:10.280 --> 02:39:13.800]  they were the league that was causing the past four seven members of that
[02:39:13.800 --> 02:39:17.320]  crew working inside mexico cartel was finding out
[02:39:17.320 --> 02:39:19.880]  information that they were actually training out
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:23.560]  and they were coming after them gunning similar to a situation that happened
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:28.600]  with kiki tamarina 1985 this has been an ongoing operation for
[02:39:28.600 --> 02:39:32.520]  gosh a number of years though like i said earlier in one of your broadcasts uh
[02:39:32.520 --> 02:39:36.760]  they take it off the shelf tweak it a little bit dust it off put it back out
[02:39:36.760 --> 02:39:41.240]  and in an operation i'll speed up here a little bit so
[02:39:41.240 --> 02:39:46.760]  then my friend down there two others they got transferred over to afghanistan
[02:39:46.760 --> 02:39:50.760]  uh military intelligence unit over there again working with the nato force
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:55.560]  the nato began so they took their nato force over there began to find
[02:39:55.560 --> 02:39:59.400]  numerous weapons that are coming from stockpiles from the direct commercial
[02:39:59.400 --> 02:40:04.040]  sales program into uh jordan turkey
[02:40:04.040 --> 02:40:09.960]  satchel stand uh and those were going into what they referred to as safe houses
[02:40:09.960 --> 02:40:17.320]  that were being uh run by um element or organization within the cia
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:21.560]  um i think that has become public well now
[02:40:21.560 --> 02:40:26.680]  those weapons that were found uh by there that well let me get back here the
[02:40:26.680 --> 02:40:30.120]  nato guy relayed that information to my contact
[02:40:30.120 --> 02:40:34.120]  my contact told me that hey the direct commercial sales program
[02:40:34.120 --> 02:40:41.160]  is sending weapons over to cia safe houses and they're being dispersed to
[02:40:41.160 --> 02:40:47.400]  faction within the cerian rebel now then reported that we're running to the
[02:40:47.400 --> 02:40:52.280]  cerian rebel the cerian rebels are so interspersed with so many
[02:40:52.280 --> 02:40:56.680]  organizations that infield traded they're very forward so these
[02:40:56.680 --> 02:41:00.200]  weapons we lost money we could not monitor them
[02:41:00.200 --> 02:41:03.480]  blue lantern reported both to monitor these weapons
[02:41:03.480 --> 02:41:08.600]  uh tracking devices things like that find out where they were going
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:12.520]  all right then about a year later after that
[02:41:12.520 --> 02:41:16.440]  these weapons began to show up in these factions of these rebels had
[02:41:16.440 --> 02:41:20.440]  they were us made weapons they were high impact weapons there was
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:28.360]  rpg um m16 um which are not really high impact but uh any aircraft all kinds of
[02:41:28.360 --> 02:41:32.840]  different 105 houses are chill 75 millimeters
[02:41:32.840 --> 02:41:38.840]  armor piercing uh stuff these things was scattered to various safe houses and
[02:41:38.840 --> 02:41:46.120]  gutter uh and pakistan and turkish um then when we had the attack on the
[02:41:46.120 --> 02:41:50.040]  embassy some of these groups that were supposed to be
[02:41:50.040 --> 02:41:54.680]  protecting that embassy was told to stand down a national
[02:41:54.680 --> 02:41:59.640]  security batter as a result of that attack we lost
[02:41:59.640 --> 02:42:03.480]  in the embassy i would have probably never got into
[02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:06.520]  this except i heard a plea from one of the mothers
[02:42:06.520 --> 02:42:09.960]  of one of these men that was killed there has been gossip
[02:42:09.960 --> 02:42:14.280]  all she was doing was begging our government to tell her what happened
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:17.640]  and tosh you've told that story you're telling folks why you did this
[02:42:17.640 --> 02:42:21.560]  you know coming out of relative obscurity since 1991 the last time you
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:26.440]  testified to congress uh on round two of iran contra to tell this and
[02:42:26.440 --> 02:42:31.240]  risk your life and expose what your nato source to recap
[02:42:31.240 --> 02:42:34.760]  you said no the word is they had the ambassador basically killed the stand
[02:42:34.760 --> 02:42:38.200]  down was deliberate and a lot of that's come out my sources say that as well
[02:42:38.200 --> 02:42:42.440]  you just talked directly to the nato source and other pentagon sources as
[02:42:42.440 --> 02:42:45.160]  you said military sources high level that confirmed it
[02:42:45.160 --> 02:42:48.840]  now you uh is it accurate because i've got your statements from facebook tell us
[02:42:48.840 --> 02:42:52.120]  about the repercussions you've got because we know they go after whistle
[02:42:52.120 --> 02:42:54.760]  blowers that expose their crimes what's happening
[02:42:54.760 --> 02:42:57.720]  right okay now we're starting up in here so then
[02:42:57.720 --> 02:43:01.720]  what i thought i could do with my friend in there he said what what can you do
[02:43:01.720 --> 02:43:05.240]  and i said well i'll contact various people that i do know is that we get
[02:43:05.240 --> 02:43:09.160]  the story out so i thought we could hit mainstream media and then
[02:43:09.160 --> 02:43:13.720]  bam so i immediately got shut down that sort of alarming a little bit so i
[02:43:13.720 --> 02:43:17.240]  said okay i'm gonna go out that's right you did interviews with fox news and
[02:43:17.240 --> 02:43:22.280]  others and none of it aired not it not as yet and i understand that there's
[02:43:22.280 --> 02:43:26.600]  those uh some little problems that they're having about airing just
[02:43:26.600 --> 02:43:29.160]  that were i was about to say so you've done that interview but they haven't
[02:43:29.160 --> 02:43:33.080]  aired it go ahead all right right so i thought well the only
[02:43:33.080 --> 02:43:37.000]  thing's going to protect me is get this information out there before the fact
[02:43:37.000 --> 02:43:45.640]  so i began to say okay here's the story this after these questions that i have
[02:43:45.640 --> 02:43:51.800]  uh for the sake of mrs fit after the question of what happened to her son
[02:43:51.800 --> 02:43:55.480]  why is that why is there in my opinion a cover-up
[02:43:55.480 --> 02:44:00.200]  the only reason that i feel that there's a cover-up just because of the weapon
[02:44:00.200 --> 02:44:03.400]  that we're shipped legally through the direct commercial sales
[02:44:03.400 --> 02:44:06.680]  that we're getting culpered into rebel's hand
[02:44:06.680 --> 02:44:10.520]  and being used against our truth sure and now obama signed an order saying he's
[02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:13.960]  allowed to arm terrorists but it's retroactive it still doesn't hold water
[02:44:13.960 --> 02:44:17.720]  so what's the doj well what are they saying to you well
[02:44:17.720 --> 02:44:20.440]  all right they were supposed to come out here and we're gonna have a sort of a
[02:44:20.440 --> 02:44:23.480]  top level but not a top level we're going to have a meeting about this at
[02:44:23.480 --> 02:44:26.520]  peterson air force base of sometime around the 20
[02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:30.120]  i think it was a 23rd 24th somewhere along there
[02:44:30.120 --> 02:44:34.520]  and then as a result of me going to the public releasing the story
[02:44:34.520 --> 02:44:38.600]  they called off that meeting the meeting was going to be a
[02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:43.160]  preliminary meeting to talk to me about this NATO source and also my
[02:44:43.160 --> 02:44:50.360]  current friend uh and uh i was uh told that i would be called back this was a
[02:44:50.360 --> 02:44:53.880]  preliminary meeting and i'll probably be called back to dc
[02:44:53.880 --> 02:44:58.440]  to testify to what i've said publicly sure they always say that though you
[02:44:58.440 --> 02:45:00.680]  know i mean you're smarter than i am you've been through this they're trying
[02:45:00.680 --> 02:45:04.840]  to find out who the sources are well that's exactly what i'd already gone
[02:45:04.840 --> 02:45:08.680]  through that was passenger situation and then also back in the earlier stuff

[02:46:19.480 --> 02:46:23.320]  and they wanted to know my sources and i said well i'm a journalist i'm not
[02:46:23.320 --> 02:46:29.880]  going to divulge my sources and this is the quote sir we will see about that
[02:46:29.880 --> 02:46:34.760]  to me i considered that as a threat and then i needed to call my friend jill
[02:46:34.760 --> 02:46:37.880]  marz he advised me to get back in touch with you
[02:46:37.880 --> 02:46:41.560]  get it out public before the fact that you've been pressed
[02:46:41.560 --> 02:46:46.920]  i take it as a threat now they want to tell me to tell them who my sources are
[02:46:46.920 --> 02:46:50.600]  and they told me who my sources are in the u.s military
[02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:54.920]  i refuse to do that so now are they going to try to make me a blazzy manning
[02:46:54.920 --> 02:46:57.880]  and a snowden or crossbreed between the two
[02:46:57.880 --> 02:47:01.240]  i'm not a government employee i'm here here's the deal they're there at war with

[02:47:27.000 --> 02:47:30.760]  well mr plumley is doing exactly what needs to be done and hats off to him
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:34.040]  for being a whistleblower this is exactly what has to happen
[02:47:34.040 --> 02:47:37.720]  those who have knowledge of what's going on need to expose it and
[02:47:37.720 --> 02:47:40.760]  and he's a hero frankly he's just just as much a hero snowden
[02:47:40.760 --> 02:47:43.240]  if not more so since he's still in the united states
[02:47:43.240 --> 02:47:47.080]  i would encourage him to contact senator ram paul's office
[02:47:47.080 --> 02:47:51.240]  or one of the other patriots maybe a cruise someone at the high levels of
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:54.520]  us government to go there and testify go to their
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:57.640]  offices now become one of their witnesses that's what that's probably
[02:47:57.640 --> 02:48:00.680]  your best protection in the league that's right because what people don't

[02:54:12.200 --> 02:54:15.800]  then he said i could say it on air um he told the senate arms services
[02:54:15.800 --> 02:54:19.240]  committee all this info and i knew this a few weeks ago
[02:54:19.240 --> 02:54:22.840]  um and they said we're going to take him here and have him testify
[02:54:22.840 --> 02:54:25.960]  now they called him up and said what you were giving was illegal and what you
[02:54:25.960 --> 02:54:30.600]  did was illegal and we want your sources in the pentagon and in nato
[02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:33.080]  uh and he said well i'm a journalist i don't have to give you that and they
[02:54:33.080 --> 02:54:35.080]  said we'll see about that that's a threat now they've
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:37.560]  they got him under surveillance messing with him
[02:54:37.560 --> 02:54:40.840]  and this is how they operate i mean they're there to just get the info to
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:43.720]  shut down they all know they had predator drones watching the whole deal
[02:54:43.720 --> 02:54:47.160]  it was an order kill the ambassador cover it up to cover up giving the
[02:54:47.160 --> 02:54:50.600]  stinger missiles al qaeda which will probably use to blow up airplanes later
[02:54:50.600 --> 02:54:54.600]  and take our rights i mean you know it's that simple but it's all out there now
[02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:58.440]  so we to steward your constitutional lawyer this is a big deal
[02:54:58.440 --> 02:55:02.120]  it is and i agree with you yeah he's contacting the behind the scenes
[02:55:02.120 --> 02:55:05.560]  he needs to go have a press conference he's done it here but it shows how
[02:55:05.560 --> 02:55:09.160]  cowardly the media is not one person in that hour long press conference would
[02:55:09.160 --> 02:55:13.880]  ask obama about obama care yesterday i mean i mean look at info wars.com
[02:55:13.880 --> 02:55:17.160]  obama trendies want mandatory helmets for walking
[02:55:17.160 --> 02:55:20.760]  14 out of 20 austinites i think we should wear helmets
[02:55:20.760 --> 02:55:26.440]  i mean it's just servile cowards everywhere and toss you are a hero
[02:55:26.440 --> 02:55:30.200]  in a world of cowards standing up for what's right is heroic
[02:55:30.200 --> 02:55:33.160]  i'm sorry and it's easy to charge up a machine gun hill
[02:55:33.160 --> 02:55:36.360]  studies have shown it's harder it ball by yourself
[02:55:36.360 --> 02:55:40.680]  out there to go public against the whole power structure so your comments
[02:55:40.680 --> 02:55:45.320]  here's sturt roads to toss plumbly he's he's right to not trust politicians
[02:55:45.320 --> 02:55:48.600]  so i think he's right to do it the dual prong approach
[02:55:48.600 --> 02:55:51.960]  go to the media make it as big as you can through any alternative media you
[02:55:51.960 --> 02:55:56.040]  possibly can do but also do try to use someone like rand paul
[02:55:56.040 --> 02:55:59.320]  or senator cruz who have bigger balls and grassy frankly
[02:55:59.320 --> 02:56:03.720]  so go to someone like that don't count on it but that's your best shot and more
[02:56:03.720 --> 02:56:06.760]  public you are to say for you are but they all know i've talked to pentagon
[02:56:06.760 --> 02:56:09.720]  people and we had them on air and then they get threatened and make me retract
[02:56:09.720 --> 02:56:12.680]  what they already said on air right i mean i do a week after the whole deal
[02:56:12.680 --> 02:56:15.240]  they set him up to kill them they got rid of them to give the missiles
[02:56:15.240 --> 02:56:18.120]  and i mean now he's just got it directly from another nato person
[02:56:18.120 --> 02:56:21.400]  he needs more documentation and as much as you can throw out there right now
[02:56:21.400 --> 02:56:25.080]  so that's that's too it's too late for them to stop you the better
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:27.640]  i mean obviously they probably know the colonel he's talking to and they know
[02:56:27.640 --> 02:56:31.400]  the nato guy is they just want to try to have a chilling effect but what if

[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:26.920]  through the time to get me in contact with to the mainstream media who will
[02:57:26.920 --> 02:57:31.400]  start these questions to the people that go to a press conference and ask the

[02:57:55.800 --> 02:57:59.320]  bearish factions of the Syrian rebel with high caliber
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:03.880]  impact weapons from the united states arsenal yes or no
[02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:07.480]  number two is the united states little known direct commercial sales program
[02:58:07.480 --> 02:58:11.560]  also known as the blue lantern report being used as a cutout
[02:58:11.560 --> 02:58:15.560]  to secretly aid both sides of a middle eastern civil war
[02:58:15.560 --> 02:58:19.560]  that's question number two yes or no is a fair god

[03:00:27.800 --> 03:00:31.960]  uh just in a mosh out of michigan he's really good ran paul's just hard to get
[03:00:31.960 --> 03:00:35.560]  through his gatekeepers i gotta have to call ran paul at his home
[03:00:35.560 --> 03:00:38.840]  his kentucky house to get him on if i wanted to never get through all his
[03:00:38.840 --> 03:00:42.280]  minions um that are basically a bunch of daily
[03:00:42.280 --> 03:00:44.600]  caller people which is fine i don't even care
[03:00:44.600 --> 03:00:47.080]  uh you know i don't need to get him on my show the point is he last time he came
[03:00:47.080 --> 03:00:49.720]  on he called me and wanted to come on why don't ever hear from you well

[03:00:59.720 --> 03:01:04.120]  ran paul or ted crews you can't get to him so i think you want to take tosh

[03:02:28.280 --> 03:02:32.760]  this is this should be asking these questions american people should be
[03:02:32.760 --> 03:02:35.160]  asking these exactly you've already done a lot of work
[03:02:35.160 --> 03:02:37.400]  you've done it over and over again and people need to get up off their hind
