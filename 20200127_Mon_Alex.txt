[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Waging War on Corruption. It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:30.000 --> 00:46.000]  Here we are Monday, January 27th, 2020. 280 days precisely left until the 2020 election.
[00:46.000 --> 00:55.000]  Never a slow news day as we accelerate towards the singularity, the quickening end of days, the beginning of a new age, depending on how you look at it.
[00:55.000 --> 01:04.000]  The battle of the gods, Guder Damarong, the apocalypse.
[01:04.000 --> 01:25.000]  But as we sit here in the year 2020, our future destiny governs the fate of untold billions of people into the future if we simply take that destiny in our hands.
[01:25.000 --> 01:36.000]  Well, we always knew John Bolton was the secret weapon against Trump.
[01:36.000 --> 01:47.000]  And the New York Times this weekend to overshadow the beginning of the Republicans defense that they're finally able to put on after four months of propaganda and disinformation.
[01:47.000 --> 01:57.000]  That, oh, something happened in this room. It all happened in this room. That's the name of the book. You make a lot of sick jokes about it.
[01:57.000 --> 02:03.000]  But the cover of the book is an oval for the oval office and John Bolton was in there.
[02:03.000 --> 02:09.000]  And he supposedly can cooperate with no one else heard or no one else saw.
[02:09.000 --> 02:18.000]  But of course, he and a few others are really what the whistleblower is. They're just moles inside line.
[02:18.000 --> 02:26.000]  The room where it happened. Is that the room where he got that ridiculous mustache?
[02:26.000 --> 02:34.000]  I mean, we know he helped when they attacked Iraq for the second time in 2003 and we know they helped cook up lies about WMDs.
[02:34.000 --> 02:40.000]  So we know that happened in that room. And we know the New York Times helped put those lies out.
[02:40.000 --> 02:50.000]  So yet again, the New York Times and John Bolton have teamed up together to give us another hoax under the line.
[02:50.000 --> 02:58.000]  But even if the president said we're going to withhold the aid unless they go after corruption, that wouldn't be a crime.
[02:58.000 --> 03:06.000]  In fact, that would be the law on foreign aid.
[03:06.000 --> 03:12.000]  But the president worried about corruption, Ukraine, the president making sure the law was followed.
[03:12.000 --> 03:19.000]  That is transmuted into a crime by alchemy.
[03:19.000 --> 03:23.000]  So we have the second day of the Republican defense.
[03:23.000 --> 03:28.000]  They had a few hours on Saturday, but we're going to have another day and a half now.
[03:28.000 --> 03:36.000]  The next few hours we'll cover a lot of it here live. I watched it on Saturday. It was extremely powerful.
[03:36.000 --> 03:48.000]  And it was also very frustrating because I was sitting there watching Jay Sekulow and others put on absolutely truthful on target defense
[03:48.000 --> 03:56.000]  and to see truth, total truth, because I follow this in depth of just absolute down the line truth
[03:56.000 --> 04:03.000]  versus what chef has been doing. It's just ridiculous that they've gotten away with this many hoaxes.
[04:03.000 --> 04:08.000]  And I just wonder if they're not punished somehow for their crimes, what the new ones will be.
[04:08.000 --> 04:19.000]  And then I started getting a headache because there they were showing the old FISA court two plus years ago that came out and said that there was fraud going on against the president, against America.
[04:19.000 --> 04:29.000]  Then they were talking about Crossfire Hurricane that we broke. Info wars broke the FISA memo when no one else would cover it.
[04:29.000 --> 04:37.000]  William Benny called me up, former head of the NSA, the head of technical, actually the guy that ran it, called me up one morning and said,
[04:37.000 --> 04:45.000]  hey, I got a call from somebody that says nobody's willing to pick this up, but you should. It's been out for a while. Here it is. I'll come on.
[04:45.000 --> 04:54.000]  And it was the total bombshell, zero coverage by anybody, total zero coverage, except here. It's just incredible.
[04:54.000 --> 04:59.000]  But now it's time to talk about the Congress.
[04:59.000 --> 05:10.000]  It's time to take a new healthier approach to one of your most basic needs. The Alexa Pure Pro water filtration system is the same water filter that Alex and the Info Wars crew use every day for the purest water possible.
[05:10.000 --> 05:17.000]  You can start cleaning the toxins from your water for clean, healthy and delicious drinking water. Perfect for preppers or anyone concerned with the healthier source of water.
[05:17.000 --> 05:25.000]  The Alexa Pure Pro can remove up to 99.9% of impurities. This groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system is like no other.
[05:25.000 --> 05:29.000]  Make sure your water is up to your standards today with the Alexa Pure Pro.
[05:55.000 --> 05:59.000]  All part of the fight. Info Wars. Brought to you by you.
[06:06.000 --> 06:16.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the Info War.
[06:16.000 --> 06:29.000]  Remember, a couple years ago, Devin Nunes, back when he was still in control of the committee before we lost control in 2018.
[06:29.000 --> 06:36.000]  Nancy Pelosi again, and he kept saying, I'm going to release the FISA memo.
[06:36.000 --> 06:53.000]  And I'm like, wait a minute. Isn't that the same memo that William Benny, former technical head of the NSA, called me up years ago and said, hey, some folks are very interested in this getting out and no one will touch it.
[06:53.000 --> 07:05.000]  Even though it's an official inspector general of the courts, and the courts released rulings saying we were given fake intelligence, we were lied to.
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  That broke on Info Wars.
[07:09.000 --> 07:19.000]  And when we broke that, no one picked it up, not our detractors, no one, because it was real.
[07:19.000 --> 07:22.000]  And they didn't know what to do.
[07:22.000 --> 07:33.000]  And again, it's not about going, oh, look, we were right again. It's about saying how frightening is that that so many times we have to release stuff here when no one else will.
[07:33.000 --> 07:38.000]  Because if you do release things like that, the deep state comes after you.
[07:38.000 --> 07:46.000]  And of course, Mr. Benny had just met with the president and had been meeting with others from the White House quite often at that point and ongoing.
[07:46.000 --> 07:55.000]  So they can understand how the president was being spied on and how the NSA really works so Trump could reverse engineer it and try to get control of the bureaucracy.
[07:55.000 --> 08:05.000]  And not just believe what he was being told by the head of national intelligence and others who he later replaced.
[08:05.000 --> 08:12.000]  And think about that. You can go back to the interview two plus years ago, William Benny.
[08:12.000 --> 08:18.000]  Info Wars releases the Nunez FISA memo.
[08:18.000 --> 08:21.000]  And people went, wait, this has been out a few months, you didn't release it.
[08:21.000 --> 08:27.000]  We released it in the news. We made a big deal about it. We dropped smoke bombs on it like the military does to say where the target is.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  We said, look, here it is.
[08:29.000 --> 08:36.000]  Oh, you found the big jewel in the crown of the idol.
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.000]  But, you know, the people that put it there thousands of years ago, they originally had it.
[08:41.000 --> 08:50.000]  So you didn't find this lost city. You didn't find the ruby because technically the people that built this found it.
[08:50.000 --> 08:54.000]  And it's not about me complaining that we didn't get the credit or the attention.
[08:54.000 --> 08:58.000]  It's that that's the Jedi mind tricks I see in the media all the time.
[08:58.000 --> 09:05.000]  Oh, well, I mean, this isn't new. This is old.
[09:05.000 --> 09:11.000]  Yeah. And the White House called William Benny and asked him to call me and put it on air.
[09:11.000 --> 09:18.000]  And Benny said that on air. He said, yeah, some folks in the government called me and said, hey, this should get out. Call Alex.
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.000]  So the former head of the NSA that ran it.
[09:24.000 --> 09:32.000]  Famous whistleblower totally respected one of the most famous code breakers in history comes on the show with total credibility.
[09:32.000 --> 09:41.000]  And it was stopped dead total discipline by the media to have no coverage other than a few right wing outlets going, oh, well, that's old news.
[09:41.000 --> 09:45.000]  And then daring not touch it.
[09:45.000 --> 09:52.000]  I have say when you're in the position I've been in at this nexus point between government media and corporations.
[09:52.000 --> 09:59.000]  You see stuff nobody else sees and you learn how this stuff works and how it operates.
[09:59.000 --> 10:01.000]  There it is early.
[10:01.000 --> 10:04.000]  January.
[10:04.000 --> 10:15.000]  2018, a little over two years ago in force released a secret visa memo.
[10:15.000 --> 10:22.000]  As you notice, Nunes kept saying it was secret. Well, that meant the redacted parts, but now they've released most of the redacted.
[10:22.000 --> 10:27.000]  But there's crossfire hurricane right there for you the whole deal now.
[10:27.000 --> 10:38.000]  And finally, Jay Sekulow got up there and talked about how criminal it was how illegal it was and how the courts said it was criminal and went to the White House.
[10:38.000 --> 10:47.000]  And couldn't even get to the president because the neocons were keeping him away.
[10:47.000 --> 10:57.000]  So one arm of the White House had to hopefully get it on this show, hopefully have the secret service who sometimes brings the president stuff, get it to him.
[10:57.000 --> 10:59.000]  That's how crazy this is.
[10:59.000 --> 11:03.000]  And that's why you saw panicked headlines everywhere.
[11:03.000 --> 11:16.000]  Chief of staff battles to keep info wars off the president's desk. Kelly's main mission is to stop info wars from getting to the president's desk.
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  Jay Sekulow was talking about it. So the good news is they failed to stop all this coming out.
[11:21.000 --> 11:37.000]  But info wars has to stay on air because most of the time it's us that get a story that nobody's covering and get it out to the world and break through the electronic Berlin Wall.
[11:37.000 --> 11:41.000]  Drudge report a lot of times amplifies what we're doing of drugs.
[11:41.000 --> 11:43.000]  You go research it himself and confirm it's accurate.
[11:43.000 --> 11:47.000]  Drugs can't even touch something like that at that point because who knows if it's real.
[11:47.000 --> 11:55.000]  We've been so demonized and so attacked that it's an act of courage to even promote us in a lot of circles.
[11:55.000 --> 12:01.000]  Because as George Arwell said, in a world of universal deceit telling the truce revolutionary act.
[12:01.000 --> 12:12.000]  So I'm going to get William Benning back on the broadcast in hindsight to look at this because imagine how they're able to turn all this around to John Bolton saying it happened in this room.
[12:12.000 --> 12:18.000]  What Bolton, you have sex with kidnap kids in a room or something?
[12:18.000 --> 12:21.000]  Or did you finally trim off that obnoxious mustache you've got?
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  I mean, what happened creepazoid in the room?
[12:25.000 --> 12:29.000]  He's the big bombshell guy.
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  Oh, the Republicans defenses overshadowed by the huge book proposal.
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  He's floating around and he's ready to testify and come in as the big star.
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  And say the president told him I want quid pro quo.
[12:46.000 --> 12:52.000]  As if anyone believes a man who helped develop the WMD's and Iraq lie with the New York Times.
[12:52.000 --> 12:54.000]  Oh, and who's he working with again?
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.000]  The New York Times in another fraud.
[12:57.000 --> 13:00.000]  This time not to take us to war and spend trillions of dollars.
[13:00.000 --> 13:05.000]  No, to remove our president trying to keep us from going to war.
[13:05.000 --> 13:13.000]  And we warned the president not to get anywhere near John Bolton.
[13:13.000 --> 13:15.000]  But the president didn't listen.
[13:15.000 --> 13:21.000]  Now the president says I don't want any never Trumpers and any neocons and anybody ever worked for Soros.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  It's a litmus test.
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  I'm the president.
[13:24.000 --> 13:30.000]  And if I find out you work for any of these groups, you're not getting near the White House because they will pledge allegiance to the president.
[13:30.000 --> 13:36.000]  They will pledge allegiance to the Constitution, they'll do it all day long, but all they do is work against this country and we know they do.
[13:36.000 --> 13:45.000]  The neocons presided over the sellout of the country to the chai comms and others.
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  And so beautiful things are happening, but also frightening things are happening.
[13:49.000 --> 13:58.000]  And the defense of the president's about to start back up and we're going to be going to large pieces of it and the parts we don't get to will also be aired.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  Obviously, you're in the war room today with Owen Schreuer and Savannah Hernandez and others.
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  And of course, David Knight, weekday mornings at 8 a.m.
[14:06.000 --> 14:12.000]  You'll find it all at band.video and infowars.com, word slash show as well as on satellite for radio and TV.
[14:12.000 --> 14:15.000]  And the only way we reach new people is you.
[14:15.000 --> 14:25.000]  But you can now see the panic attacks to get us off air because we were exposing the Soros moles by name and getting them removed.
[14:25.000 --> 14:27.000]  We were exposing the crossfire hurricane.
[14:27.000 --> 14:29.000]  We had a big enough bullhorn.
[14:29.000 --> 14:36.000]  That's why they had to indict stone and put him under investigation so they can then tell the president don't talk to stone.
[14:36.000 --> 14:38.000]  It'll look like obstruction.
[14:38.000 --> 14:40.000]  The stone was advising him every day.
[14:40.000 --> 14:48.000]  So that's another reason they came up with stone with Russian gate and sort of subpoenaing him was because they had to stop that conduit.
[14:48.000 --> 14:57.000]  That nightmare scenario where Roger Stone and Alex Jones were warning the president on a daily basis.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  Think about that.
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  But now Trump knows we were right.
[15:03.000 --> 15:08.000]  And so now Trump has advisors that demand.
[15:08.000 --> 15:18.000]  News wars articles and daily wire articles and summit dot news articles get to the president.
[15:18.000 --> 15:25.000]  I can tell you the president is very, very thankful for this broadcast and very, very thankful to the viewers and listeners that make it possible.
[15:25.000 --> 15:30.000]  I can tell you specifically that the president has.
[15:30.000 --> 15:38.000]  Thank us. Thank our reporters. Thank reporters. We sponsor White House gets that with the platforming that is what we're doing.
[15:38.000 --> 15:43.000]  And the president thinks the audience here at info wars for keeping info wars on the air in its critical mission.
[15:43.000 --> 15:51.000]  We're stepping up the plate with your prayers, spreading the word about the broadcast, the articles, videos and purchasing products at info wars store.com.
[15:51.000 --> 15:56.000]  We come back the latest on the coronavirus is definitely shaping up to be a monster.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  Stay with us.
[15:58.000 --> 16:01.000]  I'm here with Scott. You see him founder of omg tax.
[16:01.000 --> 16:06.000]  Tell us how your company helps our listeners out there who have a problem with the IRS.
[16:06.000 --> 16:12.000]  My team of lawyers enrolled agents and licensed tax experts remove wage garishments sometimes in the same day.
[16:12.000 --> 16:14.000]  We even have reduced the total debt.
[16:14.000 --> 16:18.000]  Some of our clients were required to pay for what is known as an offer in compromise.
[16:18.000 --> 16:20.000]  Can you give us an example of somebody you help?
[16:20.000 --> 16:27.000]  Oh, can I ever we have taken a $500,000 liability with the IRS?
[16:27.000 --> 16:33.000]  Guess what? The client didn't pay a dime through the representation known as non collectible status with the government.
[16:33.000 --> 16:43.000]  If you owe the IRS more than $10,000 and you want to see if it's possible to pay a lot less, call omg tax right now for a free tax saving consultation.
[16:43.000 --> 16:57.000]  Call 800-486-8112-800-486-8112-800-486-8112. That's 800-486-8112.
[16:57.000 --> 17:00.000]  Attention GCN self reliance listeners.
[17:00.000 --> 17:06.000]  If you've ever wanted an emergency solar survival backup system, but we're waiting for prices too crazy to pass up.
[17:06.000 --> 17:09.000]  This will be the most important message you'll ever hear.
[17:09.000 --> 17:18.000]  I want to tell you about a huge sale with historically low prices on our PPX microgrid system that's going to let you produce an endless supply of electricity off the grid.
[17:18.000 --> 17:23.000]  The clearance price is a result of the historic flooding we're having here right on the east bank of the Mississippi.
[17:23.000 --> 17:29.000]  Because of the flooding, we've had to move a lot of our inventory to a temporary location and rather than move it back to the warehouse,
[17:29.000 --> 17:35.000]  we thought we'd offer the system at a price that might seem unbelievable if you didn't know the floodwaters backstory.
[17:35.000 --> 17:41.000]  So here's what you should do right now. Check out the PPX microgrid system at myownpowergrid.com.
[17:41.000 --> 17:47.000]  That's myownpowergrid.com. Over $1,000 in great off the grid gear and a ton of bonuses too.
[17:47.000 --> 17:51.000]  And the best part? You're not going to pay $750 or $500 or even $200.
[17:51.000 --> 18:06.000]  Go to myownpowergrid.com to learn more. That's myownpowergrid.com.
[18:22.000 --> 18:29.000]  You can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus. I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months. It's incredible.
[18:29.000 --> 18:36.000]  So do yourself a favor. Try out the products if you've been on the fence. You can't lose except if you don't take action.
[18:36.000 --> 18:43.000]  Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering thanks to your support and God's grace in our action.
[18:43.000 --> 18:48.000]  But you need these products. That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing.
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  And then when you get great results, please tell others about it word of mouth.
[18:52.000 --> 19:20.000]  That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding. We're fighting to win and we are winning. Thanks to you.
[19:20.000 --> 19:26.000]  You're still lacking on the big tech censorship taking action against that in some other areas.
[19:26.000 --> 19:32.000]  But trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China, Trump's been doing an amazing job.
[19:32.000 --> 19:39.000]  But now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective.
[19:39.000 --> 19:44.000]  And the globalists are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way.
[19:44.000 --> 19:52.000]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them. But it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[19:52.000 --> 20:17.000]  That's an attempt to demoralize us. We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[20:22.000 --> 20:44.000]  When one man dies, it's a tragedy. When 10,000 died, it's a statistic. That's what Joe Stalin said. And it's really true.
[20:44.000 --> 20:52.000]  Thousands and thousands have really died. Tens of thousands are clearly infected with the coronavirus.
[20:52.000 --> 20:59.000]  And there's a multinational cover-up of that going on. I'm going to cover it in great detail next segment.
[20:59.000 --> 21:08.000]  And it's now being confirmed that this coronavirus was being weaponized and studied in labs in the United States, Canada, Europe, China, you name it.
[21:08.000 --> 21:19.000]  And that the Chai comms got caught stealing it out of labs. And so the big takeaway is, why are all these labs around the world weaponizing viruses,
[21:19.000 --> 21:27.000]  quote, to study them or owing case it ever mutates, they've got the weaponized virus and they can make a vaccine out of it?
[21:27.000 --> 21:38.000]  Because the cover for bioweapons production is research into countering bioweapons. And that's how Russia, China, the United States, the UK.
[21:38.000 --> 21:47.000]  That's how all these nuclear powers and biological weapon powers have gotten around it is research, defense research.
[21:47.000 --> 21:58.000]  And it's madness. And any pathogen, this deadly, you shouldn't be doing it in an underground base, like out of some resident evil movie.
[21:58.000 --> 22:16.000]  Well, guess what? They do it at places like the University of Texas in Galveston, level four facilities that are not in level four containment areas.
[22:16.000 --> 22:25.000]  So that's all coming up.
[22:25.000 --> 22:36.000]  Next segment. Now, everybody wants me to talk about Kobe Bryant.
[22:36.000 --> 22:46.000]  And at one level, if I do that, it's giving in to pop culture. But if we can use pop culture as a way to get people to think outside the box,
[22:46.000 --> 22:57.000]  it's one of the most successful ways that we can reach out to folks that aren't into politics and aren't aware of what's going on.
[22:57.000 --> 23:07.000]  And so it is very important and it's very, very sad what happened. And we've seen some people say some really nasty mean things, trying to get attention that I don't agree with,
[23:07.000 --> 23:11.000]  but I defend their right to say it and to do it.
[23:11.000 --> 23:23.000]  So in the final segment of this hour, we're going to get to the situation with Kobe Bryant because it is important and the responses to it are important.
[23:23.000 --> 23:34.000]  There's a lot of facets to it. It's a Rosetta Stone. And then there's also a tax on helicopters and civilian use of those.
[23:34.000 --> 23:37.000]  So it also goes into the mindset of media hype.
[23:37.000 --> 23:46.000]  Helicopters are one of the most successful, safe conveyances out there. We have the statistics. We'll go over some of them.
[23:46.000 --> 23:55.000]  But because you have a lot of famous people that when they do have a crash happen to be on them, since it's a rich man's game in many areas, most cases,
[23:55.000 --> 24:04.000]  it is a bigger deal because it's somebody famous that died, even though when famous folks dying at automobile accidents or motorcycle accidents all the time,
[24:04.000 --> 24:10.000]  then it's just a footnote nobody calls for banning cars.
[24:10.000 --> 24:18.000]  And again, I would say that they were operating the helicopter improperly. So I'm going to get into that.
[24:18.000 --> 24:27.000]  Coming up in the final segment and have some different angles, then you're going to find most people covering.
[24:27.000 --> 24:35.000]  But I got to tell you, you got the trial, the president ongoing, the Republican defense that starts up in about 35 minutes.
[24:35.000 --> 24:42.000]  You've got this coronavirus, obviously a bio weapon, obviously manmade, obviously souped up. That's what we were saying weeks ago.
[24:42.000 --> 24:49.000]  Now I've got mainline news saying it. That's coming up next segment.
[24:49.000 --> 24:54.000]  Viruses just don't overnight mutate into something this deadly and then just pop out of nowhere.
[24:54.000 --> 25:00.000]  That's not how they work unless they have been artificially altered.
[25:00.000 --> 25:16.000]  And now with gene editing technology that's been released to the world, we're in the wheelhouse of biological armageddon.
[25:16.000 --> 25:24.000]  Human clones are old news. Human animal hybrids are old news.
[25:24.000 --> 25:30.000]  It shows that the leash has been taken off of any type of restraint.
[25:30.000 --> 25:43.000]  We shouldn't be creating gene edited babies. They shouldn't be releasing genetically engineered bacteria into the food supply.
[25:43.000 --> 25:50.000]  We shouldn't be injecting the public with live viruses that have been genetically altered.
[25:50.000 --> 25:55.000]  We shouldn't be doing a lot of things we're doing. We shouldn't be rolling out 5G.
[25:55.000 --> 25:59.000]  In fact, I had a Wall Street Journal article that was in my stack yesterday that I didn't get to.
[25:59.000 --> 26:04.000]  Can somebody find that Wall Street Journal article? I had one of the stack back, but I didn't get that back thanks.
[26:04.000 --> 26:11.000]  I had a big 5G rollout that had the same flavor and sound as a drug commercial.
[26:11.000 --> 26:19.000]  Like where it tells you all the horrible side effects, but then they've got happy people hopping and dancing.
[26:19.000 --> 26:25.000]  Dancing around in the background. It's the physical newspaper, physical Wall Street Journal.
[26:25.000 --> 26:32.000]  They're all physical, I guess. It's the classic newspaper style newspaper for young people.
[26:32.000 --> 26:35.000]  A lot of young folks don't even know what those are now, literally.
[26:35.000 --> 26:42.000]  Most people don't even make phone calls anymore and talk to people. They send text messages because they'd prefer not to have human interaction.
[26:42.000 --> 26:45.000]  We're all just going to be getting into some of those studies that are coming out on that front.
[26:45.000 --> 26:51.000]  Speaking of studies, ladies and gentlemen, I've talked a lot about this.
[26:51.000 --> 26:58.000]  The UN's own study that came out in 2007 was the last time they had a big global study on that.
[26:58.000 --> 27:09.000]  Found that over 2 billion people had neurological disorders and mental disabilities because of iodine deficiency.
[27:09.000 --> 27:19.000]  Now, they spend all the time they can trying to put the bad halogen fluoride at its other sisters, bromine, bromide, chlorine, and everything,
[27:19.000 --> 27:31.000]  but not ever telling you how important it is for neurological, for your sex life, just for everything, for your fertility,
[27:31.000 --> 27:36.000]  how important iodine is, and how it's a game changer for adults and children.
[27:36.000 --> 27:40.000]  Now, we have the pure, good, high-quality iodine that no one else has.
[27:40.000 --> 27:43.000]  We have the best atomic iodine from Deep Breath Crystals there is out there.
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  It's X2, totally pure.
[27:45.000 --> 27:52.000]  You have to have a DEA license to even have this at the factory and facility before it's put into this form because it's pure iodine.
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  You can do a lot of stuff with that.
[27:54.000 --> 27:59.000]  We also have X3 because some people cannot absorb the pure iodine by itself.
[27:59.000 --> 28:09.000]  It needs to be added with other types of clean iodine that's good iodine, but a different type of it that has been bound.
[28:09.000 --> 28:15.000]  Potassium iodine and sodium iodine, small amounts of that are added to X3 as well.
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  A lot of folks like X3 better.
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  A lot of people like X2 better.
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.000]  The point is, X2 had been sold out for a long time.
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  It's now back in stock at 40% off.
[28:25.000 --> 28:32.000]  You can get X2 and X3 together for 50% off and get pre-shipping on that combo and see which type you like.
[28:32.000 --> 28:35.000]  But believe me, you notice our information is game-changing.
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  You notice that we know what we're talking about.

[28:47.000 --> 28:50.000]  For most people, it takes about three weeks and then you'll start kind of detoxing.
[28:50.000 --> 28:53.000]  You feel like crap for about a week and then after that, it's incredible.

[30:40.000 --> 30:42.000]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[30:42.000 --> 30:44.000]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[30:44.000 --> 30:46.000]  That's why people get so sick.
[30:46.000 --> 30:47.000]  That's the main reason.
[30:47.000 --> 30:50.000]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue at higher absorption.
[30:50.000 --> 30:51.000]  It's amazing.

[31:03.000 --> 31:05.000]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[31:05.000 --> 31:08.000]  I'm pointing out the way forward.

[31:25.000 --> 31:31.000]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[31:31.000 --> 31:34.000]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen.
[31:34.000 --> 31:43.000]  And I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.
[31:43.000 --> 31:51.000]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now at infowarstore.com and I'm telling you folks, get it.

[31:56.000 --> 32:25.000]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[32:26.000 --> 32:41.000]  We'll also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[32:41.000 --> 32:56.000]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like we've done with Alex Jones blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[32:56.000 --> 33:25.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:25.000 --> 33:50.000]  Live from Austin, Texas, it's Alex Jones.
[33:50.000 --> 34:00.000]  We have been hot on the trail of the ongoing global crisis that is the coronavirus outbreak.
[34:00.000 --> 34:05.000]  It has a very high death rate for this type of pneumonia like virus.
[34:05.000 --> 34:09.000]  It's in the same family as SARS.
[34:09.000 --> 34:23.000]  And we've seen the U.N., the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation all over this like flies on, you know what, like white on rice.
[34:23.000 --> 34:32.000]  And of course now it's coming out that most experts believe it's a engineered bio weapon and that's in the medical reports.
[34:32.000 --> 34:39.000]  You don't just have viruses suddenly mutate out of nowhere that are this deadly, it almost always takes time.
[34:39.000 --> 34:58.000]  And now it turns out, surprise, surprise, here's the CBC, Chinese researchers, escorted from infectious disease lab amid RCMP investigation believing that this woman and her husband,
[34:58.000 --> 35:15.000]  an unknown number of other students from China were removed from Canada's only level four lab on July 5th amidst an RCMP investigation of what's been described as possible policy breach.
[35:15.000 --> 35:22.000]  A level four virology facility is a lab equipped to work with the most serious and deadly human and animal diseases.
[35:22.000 --> 35:28.000]  So just have folks from China, students in there, no big deal.
[35:28.000 --> 35:32.000]  You should have an underground base, people guarding it with machine guns.
[35:32.000 --> 35:44.000]  That makes the Arlington Street Lab one of the only handful in North America capable of handling pathogens requiring the highest levels of containment such as Ebola.
[35:44.000 --> 35:54.000]  Clue is a prominent virologist who helped develop the Z-Map, a treatment for the deadly Ebola virus which killed more than 11,000 people in West Africa.
[35:54.000 --> 35:59.000]  Meetings at the lab staff were told researchers are on leave for unknown period of time.
[35:59.000 --> 36:02.000]  They're told not to communicate with them.
[36:02.000 --> 36:07.000]  It goes on to say that it's being investigated as espionage.
[36:07.000 --> 36:17.000]  And here's the headline. Did China steal the coronavirus from Canada and weaponize it?
[36:17.000 --> 36:23.000]  And that's what scientists and a lot of experts are asking.
[36:23.000 --> 36:27.000]  We're going to table that for now and come back to it.
[36:27.000 --> 36:31.000]  But China scrambles to contain strengthening virus.
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  Oh, it's getting stronger.
[36:33.000 --> 36:39.000]  The virus death toll in China rises as U.S. prepares evacuation from China.
[36:39.000 --> 36:43.000]  Dow drops 400 points as coronavirus fears rise.
[36:43.000 --> 36:48.000]  Travel stocks slide. Could this be the little trick to make the market go down to hurt America?
[36:48.000 --> 36:51.000]  This is going to hurt China too, but also the U.S.
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  Draconian travel curbs needed to halt the spread of the virus, scientists warn.
[36:55.000 --> 37:01.000]  That's Yahoo News and AFP, but you notice, ladies and gentlemen,
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  our borders are still wide open.
[37:03.000 --> 37:06.000]  And when folks are coming in and untreated from Ebola areas,
[37:06.000 --> 37:10.000]  we're told not to check them or it's racist.
[37:10.000 --> 37:16.000]  But all these other countries have sealed their borders.
[37:16.000 --> 37:22.000]  Philippines to deport 500 Chinese people to prevent the spread of coronavirus.
[37:22.000 --> 37:26.000]  Those that have arrived in the time that it could take for it to incubate,
[37:26.000 --> 37:30.000]  those that could have it hidden in their systems, which is a totally normal move.
[37:30.000 --> 37:33.000]  But we're told, no, no, no.
[37:33.000 --> 37:39.000]  Continuing, Mongolia closes border with China amid coronavirus spread.
[37:39.000 --> 37:42.000]  Well, no borders, no walls, no China at all.
[37:42.000 --> 37:45.000]  No Mongolia at all. You're not supposed to have borders.
[37:45.000 --> 37:48.000]  Those are evil bad things, just ask Bernie Sanders.
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.000]  France evacuating citizens from virus hit Wuhan.
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  But why would you need to leave?
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  You don't need to leave a place.
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  You don't need to have borders to protect you.
[37:59.000 --> 38:03.000]  You don't need seawalls in areas that are hit by tidal waves.
[38:03.000 --> 38:06.000]  No, you don't need any airbags in your car.
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  You don't need a door on your house.
[38:08.000 --> 38:11.000]  This is ridiculous and very racist too.
[38:11.000 --> 38:17.000]  I think we should pay for everybody in China to come here and get free health care.
[38:17.000 --> 38:22.000]  And take kids that haven't and put it in schools with our children.
[38:22.000 --> 38:27.000]  That's what we do with TB, this drug resistant and all these other diseases that are exploding here.
[38:27.000 --> 38:30.000]  We do that.
[38:30.000 --> 38:36.000]  So we should bring folks over here.
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  So Canada is reporting more cases.
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.000]  Other countries reporting more cases. The U.S. reporting more cases.
[38:42.000 --> 38:53.000]  Revenge the 12 monkeys. Nature Science Journal warned about pathogens escaping Wuhan level 4 bio lab before coronavirus outbreak.
[38:53.000 --> 39:03.000]  That's interesting. And now they're saying that the same virus was being worked on at that Canadian facility.
[39:03.000 --> 39:08.000]  But hey, it's okay. We don't need any borders or walls.
[39:08.000 --> 39:17.000]  We don't need a Philippines or a Japan or South Korea or Mongolia.
[39:17.000 --> 39:25.000]  They should all just open their borders up. Landsat reports a 15% death rate people being infected with the virus.
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  We hope that studies off.
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.000]  Just reporting it.
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  Just reporting it, ladies and gentlemen.
[39:35.000 --> 39:40.000]  We'll continue to track it as it unfolds.
[39:40.000 --> 39:47.000]  But GZ ping says China is in a great situation. Fears mount the viruses man made by a weapon.
[39:47.000 --> 39:52.000]  Major manufacturing hub shutting down in China amid virus outbreak.
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  Yeah, they're shutting down.
[39:54.000 --> 39:59.000]  But not us. We're still shipping stuff in from China as of this morning.
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  From Wuhan.
[40:01.000 --> 40:09.000]  No borders. No wall. No USA at all. No borders. No walls. No USA at all.
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  There you go.
[40:11.000 --> 40:15.000]  So I know I haven't talked about Kobe Bryant much today.
[40:15.000 --> 40:21.000]  Even though it's the big story, you know, we can look and see what articles are getting the most traffic on info wars.
[40:21.000 --> 40:27.000]  The three or four Kobe Bryant articles and videos are getting half the traffic on info wars right now.
[40:27.000 --> 40:31.000]  And I understand I should give the people what they want.
[40:31.000 --> 40:35.000]  A lot of listeners are like, don't cover it. It's pop culture. No, it's important.
[40:35.000 --> 40:42.000]  Because we can get people that only care about pop culture to tune in by covering it.
[40:42.000 --> 40:45.000]  And then they learn everything else.
[40:45.000 --> 40:50.000]  Plus, Kobe Bryant's an interesting person. It's an interesting story has a lot of facets I want to cover.
[40:50.000 --> 40:58.000]  I've just been doing my job, I think, and covering the trial of the president and covering the stock market in trouble because of this.
[40:58.000 --> 41:06.000]  And as I said last week, and as I've said yesterday, the globalists have said they want to crash the U.S. economy.
[41:06.000 --> 41:09.000]  And Trump just won the trade war with China.
[41:09.000 --> 41:12.000]  We've been at war with them for decades by design.
[41:12.000 --> 41:18.000]  Trump just said no more white flags and made them engage in major concessions and made business open in America again.
[41:18.000 --> 41:28.000]  And then like night following day and day following night, you got Bill and Melinda Gates running tabletop exercises, 65 million debt with coronaviruses.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  And you've got them funding the development of a vaccine and patenting this coronavirus.
[41:32.000 --> 41:36.000]  And you've got Chinese researchers all over it. And it's clearly a bio weapon.
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  It's been weaponized. And here it is.
[41:38.000 --> 41:45.000]  And the excuse is, oh, we've got to create weaponized versions in case someone else does or in case it mutates into this.
[41:45.000 --> 41:53.000]  And then always, you know, the last four releases of SARS that killed a lot of people were out of Chinese labs.
[41:53.000 --> 41:57.000]  I mean, that's in the Lancet.
[41:57.000 --> 42:01.000]  That's in. We have articles on inforwers.com linking right to it.
[42:01.000 --> 42:05.000]  I mean, that's a fact.
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  So these labs don't keep us safe.
[42:07.000 --> 42:11.000]  These labs make our lives very, very dangerous.
[42:11.000 --> 42:19.000]  You know, Russia had bio weapons releases on the Chomka, I've say it right, peninsula and other areas that killed a lot of people.
[42:19.000 --> 42:23.000]  The U.S. has had bio weapon releases that kill a lot of people they tried to cover up.
[42:23.000 --> 42:29.000]  We had a sodium reactor blow up as big as Chernobyl back in the 50s in California.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  No one was told until 1987.
[42:31.000 --> 42:35.000]  Look it up.
[42:35.000 --> 42:40.000]  So who knows what's going on that we don't know about right now.
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  Who knows, I don't know.
[42:42.000 --> 42:46.000]  I just know this stinks beyond heaven.
[42:46.000 --> 42:55.000]  This is ridiculous what's going on and this virus is deadly and it is spreading and it is here and the borders are still wide open.
[42:55.000 --> 43:20.000]  We'll be right back.
[43:20.000 --> 43:25.000]  Yes, now we know we're right. The new world order is real. Satanism is real. The pedophile a leader real.
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  But we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no.
[43:29.000 --> 43:34.000]  But I just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas.
[43:34.000 --> 43:38.000]  We have never been in some small, ill place that didn't matter.
[43:38.000 --> 43:45.000]  Everything we do, every decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through and everything we're going to go through.
[43:45.000 --> 43:50.000]  So it's an incredible time to be alive. I'm going to thank you all for being aware and being involved.
[43:50.000 --> 43:56.000]  But just remember, your action now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of m4store.com is critical.
[43:56.000 --> 44:25.000]  So please take action.
[44:27.000 --> 44:33.000]  And I know you are as well. So thank you in 2019 for standing with us because you are the info war.
[44:33.000 --> 44:37.000]  And I want to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can.
[44:37.000 --> 44:41.000]  For bottom my heart, for my family and for the great crew at info wars.
[44:41.000 --> 44:46.000]  I want to thank you all because you are the info war and you know that's not just words, that's reality.
[44:46.000 --> 44:50.000]  You have made history. We have made history together.
[44:50.000 --> 44:58.000]  Infowars.com only has power because of you. And I suggest you use it.
[44:58.000 --> 45:08.000]  This time of year, I'm always promoting winter sun, our high quality organic vitamin D3, vitamin K combo.
[45:08.000 --> 45:17.000]  Because it's in the fall, it's in the winter, it's in the spring that people aren't getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin D it needs.
[45:17.000 --> 45:25.000]  And then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly viruses that are wreaking havoc out there.
[45:25.000 --> 45:30.000]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live, not just to defend against these viruses.
[45:30.000 --> 45:37.000]  So right now we have winter sun still available even though we always order only so much for sale during the fall, winter and spring.
[45:37.000 --> 45:43.000]  I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off $23.
[45:43.000 --> 45:51.000]  Despite the fact that I could sell it at full price because I want you to get it and I want to incentivize you protecting yourself and your family.
[45:51.000 --> 45:58.000]  So winter sun taken out of the tongue super high quality 40% off available now at infowarstore.com.
[45:58.000 --> 46:04.000]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste because I hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half.
[46:04.000 --> 46:08.000]  And I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[46:08.000 --> 46:13.000]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me you got to get up there and tell me.
[46:13.000 --> 46:19.000]  So here I am telling people super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste I've ever tried.
[46:19.000 --> 46:24.000]  And I'm 45 years old and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free.
[46:24.000 --> 46:36.000]  I think the big difference the game changer in this is the coral calcium because after I brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the toothpaste that I don't even like rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this.
[46:36.000 --> 46:41.000]  It feels so good. It feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[46:41.000 --> 47:10.000]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because I like the way it feels.
[47:11.000 --> 47:27.000]  It feels so good.
[47:27.000 --> 47:39.000]  Live from Austin, Texas broadcasting worldwide. It's Alex Jones.
[47:39.000 --> 48:01.000]  I'm going to address the tragic death of Kobe Bryant and his young daughter and others yesterday while flying through fog in a helicopter in Calabasas, California.
[48:01.000 --> 48:17.000]  And I'm going to start with a symposium a few days ago in Florida on human trafficking with the widow of the late Senator John McCain where she says everyone knew that he was a monster.
[48:17.000 --> 48:25.000]  Everyone knew that Jeffrey Epstein was doing all these terrible things to young girls and children, but everyone was scared.
[48:25.000 --> 48:36.000]  So you knew, but you were scared, but your husband helped bring in al-Qaeda and ISIS in Libya and in Syria that enslaved hundreds of thousands of women and children.
[48:36.000 --> 48:43.000]  He helped cover up the Dine Corps operations and child kidnapping and help defend the Clintons and their crimes.
[48:43.000 --> 48:57.000]  So it sounds like Cindy McCain's very naive about just who her late husband was because the whole currency of D.C. is on pedophilia.
[48:57.000 --> 49:01.000]  And as she says, they all knew it.
[49:01.000 --> 49:06.000]  And everybody's like, wow, you knew it. You didn't say anything.
[49:06.000 --> 49:18.000]  And she says, everybody knew. Well, you know who knew 15 years ago, Alex Jones, and only raised that point to say this.
[49:18.000 --> 49:24.000]  I'm being de-platformed. I'm being sued. I'm being attacked. They're running dirty tricks against me every day.
[49:24.000 --> 49:31.000]  And the left thumps their chest and says, Alex Jones is bad. He deserves to be destroyed. It's open season on him.
[49:31.000 --> 49:36.000]  The average leftist in the street.
[49:36.000 --> 49:52.000]  When I exposed all of this and the blackmail rings with the Clintons, Hillary, her first job with a law degree was to go to the Dixie mafia in Arkansas where the Chicago mafia that her dad was high up in actually ran their operations.
[49:52.000 --> 50:08.000]  And she represented Dixie mafia criminals who would grab children off the streets and torture them to death and rape them until their cervixes were smashed through and they could never have children and have their uterus taken out.
[50:08.000 --> 50:13.000]  Yes, men rape little girls so hard that they tore their insides out.
[50:13.000 --> 50:18.000]  I've had the women here sitting next to me.
[50:18.000 --> 50:25.000]  They also smashed their faces in, crushed their noses in, broke their jaws.
[50:25.000 --> 50:40.000]  Those are specialty and Hillary's on tape laughing and giggling about it because when you want your daughter to go to the fast track, you send her down to represent child rapist.
[50:40.000 --> 50:45.000]  And then her whole life has been the same thing. That's what she does.
[50:45.000 --> 50:55.000]  And I've interviewed women on this show that report that Hillary Clinton raped them, like Kathy O'Brien.
[50:55.000 --> 51:01.000]  And I didn't know 20 years ago if Kathy O'Brien was accurate, but later pieces of what she said came out and turned out to be true.
[51:01.000 --> 51:19.000]  And then I learned from a totally separate person, one of her stories corroborated, who didn't even know who Kathy O'Brien was, another woman who was brought to satanic rituals and was in the middle of it.
[51:19.000 --> 51:22.000]  I'm going to stop right there.
[51:22.000 --> 51:30.000]  Let's just say when you know this stuff and you watch TV and see people on it, it gives you a chill up your spine.
[51:30.000 --> 51:36.000]  So, oh, back to Kobe Bryant, sorry.
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  Sorry, back to Kobe Bryant.
[51:39.000 --> 51:47.000]  Kobe Bryant had a 19-year-old woman come up to his hotel room however many, was it 15 years ago, longer?
[51:47.000 --> 51:52.000]  And then they were never sure who said consensual, but then the whole thing got dropped.
[51:52.000 --> 51:54.000]  And he's not had a bigger history around that.
[51:54.000 --> 52:00.000]  The point is, though, you saw Kavanaugh being railroaded, you see how the left weaponizes it, how Hollywood weaponizes it.
[52:00.000 --> 52:11.000]  And then when, oh, Meryl Streep wants to give a standing ovation for Roman Polanski, who drugged and raped a 13-year-old girl.
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  Bloody.
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  I'm not going to get into the tales of it.
[52:15.000 --> 52:18.000]  They support that.
[52:18.000 --> 52:30.000]  So CNN comes out about Kobe Bryant, I've got the articles right here, and says, oh, he's a rapist, even though he was never convicted of it.
[52:30.000 --> 52:44.000]  When they are the ones on CNN that have been covering up for Jeffrey Epstein and the industrial-level information.
[52:44.000 --> 52:53.000]  I get why Ari Shafir, who I know well, many years, came out and said, oh, look at Hollywood that, you know, is covering up for Kobe Bryant.
[52:53.000 --> 52:54.000]  They're rapists.
[52:54.000 --> 52:59.000]  I'm glad his helicopter crashed and all this stuff being shocking, saying, look, you know, you guys are celebrating this rapist.
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  He's trying to jump on the bandwagon.
[53:01.000 --> 53:05.000]  You've seen the Golden Globes and other places where tearing down Hollywood's cool.
[53:05.000 --> 53:11.000]  And at a certain point, that's healthy and that's good.
[53:11.000 --> 53:20.000]  But the angle of making fun of somebody right after they're dead with their child when they were not convicted of the rape is disgusting.
[53:20.000 --> 53:23.000]  But he has the right to say it and should not be de-platformed over it.
[53:23.000 --> 53:29.000]  All I'm saying is CNN and others are saying Kobe Bryant rapist.
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  I've got the articles and videos right here.
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  And there's a backlash to that.
[53:33.000 --> 53:37.000]  They can't help their Me Too movement on that.
[53:37.000 --> 53:45.000]  Because they use that saying all men are rapists and dividing the sexes against each other to cover up their real operations.
[53:45.000 --> 53:52.000]  The Satanism, the pedophilia, the true evil that many of the CNN executives we know are indeed involved in.
[53:52.000 --> 54:01.000]  And the ritualistic trauma of the children of some of the host you see on CNN.
[54:01.000 --> 54:05.000]  That was seven, teen years ago.
[54:05.000 --> 54:15.000]  And so CNN, right after he dies with his daughter, brings that out and tweets that out, hoping to be the center of a new controversy.
[54:15.000 --> 54:20.000]  Just like Ari Shephir just did.
[54:20.000 --> 54:22.000]  Well, I like to get on the show.
[54:22.000 --> 54:29.000]  It's easy to make a point like that at that point and be the big national individual.
[54:29.000 --> 54:41.000]  But what's harder to do is to actually get into what really unfolded and what's happening and how Cindy McCain is talking about how they all knew about Jeffrey Epstein.
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  That means the Clintons and did nothing.
[54:43.000 --> 54:49.000]  But there are the Clintons at your husband's funeral, worshiping him.
[54:49.000 --> 54:52.000]  So she's now trying to play the savior here.
[54:52.000 --> 54:55.000]  But now it's a big controversy because people are like, wait a minute, you all knew.
[54:55.000 --> 54:56.000]  Think about that.
[54:56.000 --> 54:59.000]  That's the big story.
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  That's the big issue.
[55:01.000 --> 55:04.000]  And the full video is up on infowars.com.
[55:04.000 --> 55:09.000]  We all knew John McCabe's widow comments on Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking charges.
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  Here it is.
[55:11.000 --> 55:12.000]  Everything.
[55:12.000 --> 55:15.000]  You know, we, we, it hides in plain sight.
[55:15.000 --> 55:16.000]  Epstein was hiding in plain sight.
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  We all knew about him.
[55:18.000 --> 55:19.000]  We all knew what he was doing.
[55:19.000 --> 55:25.000]  But we had no one that was no legal aspect that would go after him.
[55:25.000 --> 55:28.000]  They were afraid of him for whatever reason they were afraid of him.
[55:28.000 --> 55:32.000]  All of a sudden someone said, BS, we're not afraid of you anymore.
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  And what you're doing is not only wrong, it's illegal.
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  It's, you know, all those things.
[55:36.000 --> 55:39.000]  It's, it's like a house of cards now.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  It's going to start tumbling, believe me.
[55:41.000 --> 55:45.000]  And these guys, if they don't leave the country, number one, they're going to get caught.
[55:45.000 --> 55:50.000]  And they're going, and they, not only will they get caught, but they're going to be made examples of.
[55:50.000 --> 55:54.000]  And that's exactly what we should be doing with these guys, especially.
[55:54.000 --> 56:02.000]  In my opinion, if, you know, I know there's questions, but Epstein's a chicken shit for doing what he did.
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  He should have faced the music, that one.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  He should have.
[56:06.000 --> 56:09.000]  Sorry.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  We had to delay the end of that for station.
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  She says that Jeffrey Epstein is a chicken bleeper for killing himself.
[56:15.000 --> 56:18.000]  So she goes along with the official lie that he killed himself.
[56:18.000 --> 56:22.000]  And don't worry, the people that did it are going to be made examples out of.
[56:22.000 --> 56:26.000]  Even though she admits she was an accomplice and she knew all about it.
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  So CNN's not going to call out Cindy McCain.
[56:29.000 --> 56:42.000]  They're going to call out people out there like Kobe Bryant after they're dead because they can't defend themselves 17 years after the case against them was dropped.
[56:42.000 --> 56:49.000]  And they're going to call him a rapist because that's going to cover for the real rapist that are out there.
[56:49.000 --> 56:57.000]  The people raping our minds, raping our culture, raping our health, raping our children, literally and metaphysically.
[56:57.000 --> 56:58.000]  We come back.
[56:58.000 --> 57:04.000]  I'm going to get to the cartoon that came out a few years ago that foreshadowed Kobe Bryant crashing in a helicopter.
[57:04.000 --> 57:08.000]  He survived the fictional example of that.
[57:08.000 --> 57:14.000]  And then I'm going to finish up and move on into the live coverage of the second day of the Trump defense.
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  It's powerful.
[57:15.000 --> 57:19.000]  We'll be going in and out of that, opening the phones up and then getting to all the other news.
[57:19.000 --> 57:22.000]  And there is a lot of it as it breaks and unfolds.
[57:22.000 --> 57:29.000]  Please remember, the way we reach new people is tell folks about the local amethystations you're listening to at the local TV stations.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  It's so important to do that.

[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:32.000]  Well, the second day of Trump's defense after four months of one-sided kangaroo court behavior is about to begin.
[1:00:32.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  The Democrats have been trying to block this. The mainstream media has not been covering it.
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  Stephanophilus got caught on a hot mic directing them during coverage over the weekend to not show it.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  Not let you hear what they're saying. That's how one-sided this is.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:56.000]  And even if the president was guilty of the stuff they've made up, not giving him a fair trial means he must be acquitted.
[1:00:56.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  Well, he's totally innocent. It's ridiculous.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  So we will get a feed of that for you once that kicks off.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:14.000]  Getting back into Kobe Bryant, people watch folks on TV for many years and they get to feel like they're family.
[1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:20.000]  People get sad when people die, and it's good to celebrate fellow humans, and it's good to celebrate athletes,
[1:01:20.000 --> 1:01:28.000]  but we should also celebrate our own families and our own achievements and then realize that when our neighbor dies,
[1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  it's as big a deal as Kobe Bryant dying and that that's how Hollywood controls us by hypnotizing us
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  and believing what's on the screen is more real than what's happening around us in everyday life.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  But realizing that life is short and that we're all equal and that we're mortal is also a powerful moral to all of this.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  But those attacking Bryant with an hour of him dying as a rapist, just to get headlines, are CNN.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  I mean, CNN is like a cuss word now. You just describe it. You don't have to say bad things about CNN.
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  Just say it's what CNN is. But I don't think they should be censored for it.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:10.000]  I think it's their right to jump on that bandwagon if they want to make themselves look like they're exposing abuse of women
[1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  when what their main job is is covering it up just like Sidney McCain was just doing.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:24.000]  Eerie cartoon depicts Kobe Bryant helicopter crash in 2016 comedy Central Cartoon at Sumner Redstone,
[1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  eerily depicted basketball legend Kobe Bryant crashing in a helicopter. Here it is.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  Oh, it's Kobe Bryant.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:36.000]  Help me.
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  Just pass me the trophies and we'll pull you out.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  Pass.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:44.000]  These were shacks.
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  And of course, that wasn't the only show to predict Kobe's death.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  It was done on other programs as well.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:00.000]  Kobe's going to end up dying of helicopter crash.
[1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000]  Folks said on Twitter,
[1:03:02.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  that's pretty easy to do. Somebody dies in a car accident and it ends up happening.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:12.000]  Car accidents are one of the main causes of death.
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  And I'm not part of the helicopter industry. I don't own a helicopter.
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  I've been up in them quite a bit.
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  I just know the statistics and it's one of the safest forms of travel out there.
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  Unless you're flying in fog and then you know what happens to Steve Ray Vaughn as well.
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  Very, very sad.
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:36.000]  You know, I guess I could try to get his brother on good friends with to talk about his brother and talk about this.
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  Now in the hindsight, what he thinks people should know.
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  But at the end of the day, we're all just mortal.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  And one day we'll shake off this mortal coil.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  And the day you're born is the day you start dying.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:04:00.000]  So to live is to die. And to have a child is to give them life, also give them death.
[1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000]  And to give them all the pain that comes with life.
[1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  But that's the animating contest of liberty.
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:10.000]  That's what it's all about because think of all the good things in life versus the bad.
[1:04:10.000 --> 1:04:14.000]  And it's trying to stay away from living on the edge.
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.000]  Trying to stay away from risk.
[1:04:16.000 --> 1:04:22.000]  Trying to stay away from adventure makes it a living death already.
[1:04:22.000 --> 1:04:26.000]  Every study, every statistic shows that.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:30.000]  So I'm not out there in high-risk situations for no reason.
[1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:34.000]  I go out and do high-risk things because it's what needs to be done as an example of liberty.
[1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:40.000]  I'm not going to let the globalist and anti-fun communist scum that threaten us keep me from taking the field
[1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:44.000]  because to do that is to get on my knees and I never will.
[1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  So there'll be Briance off in the wall, blue and yonder.
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  We hope he meets his maker.
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  And I hope you one day meet your maker as well and don't go to the wrong place.
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  We'll be right back with the trial of the president.
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  We've got three big sales going right now.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:02.000]  And one of them has to end within a week.

[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  The UN admits 2 billion people have low IQ or mental disabilities.
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:26.000]  They never got enough iodine.
[1:05:26.000 --> 1:05:28.000]  So just check it out for yourself.

[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  Super high quality, winter sun.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:40.000]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[1:05:40.000 --> 1:05:42.000]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:44.000]  That's why people get so sick.
[1:05:44.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  That's the main reason.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  You can supplement with this under the tongue.
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:48.000]  Get higher absorption.
[1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  It's amazing.

[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:55.000]  Protect yourself and fund the M4.
[1:05:55.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  361.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:41.000]  They are saying a prayer right now ahead of the second day of the Republican defense of President
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  Trump or the White House lawyers defense of President Trump for only the third time in
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  history.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  We're watching the trial of a sitting U.S.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:50.000]  President Trump and the U.S.
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:56.000]  President Trump are the U.S.
[1:06:56.000 --> 1:07:00.000]  Signing the deal for the second day of the second day of this.
[1:07:00.000 --> 1:07:04.000]  When what they charged him with isn't even crimes to begin with.
[1:07:04.000 --> 1:07:10.000]  Abstructing Congress when it's the right and the duty of the executive to stay separate.
[1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:12.000]  Abuse of power, some nebulous thing that came reproven.
[1:07:12.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  Truly amazing.
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  So we're gonna go to some of that live here in just a moment.
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:19.120]  that blue cities control to go out and target right wingers in thought crime.
[1:07:19.440 --> 1:07:22.760]  Dem lawmakers in Connecticut propose new police departments specifically for
[1:07:22.760 --> 1:07:25.200]  fighting far right extremism says freedom of speech.
[1:07:25.360 --> 1:07:26.120]  Unfortunate.
[1:07:26.440 --> 1:07:31.040]  The same groups are running lawsuits against us openly saying for America to
[1:07:31.040 --> 1:07:34.560]  quote survive info wars must be shut down.
[1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:35.120]  Close quote.
[1:07:37.480 --> 1:07:42.680]  But Senator Blumenthal, Senator Murphy, all of them, just unbelievable
[1:07:42.680 --> 1:07:46.960]  information, we're going to get to that coming in right now.
[1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:52.160]  You've got the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court giving admonishments here
[1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:55.680]  before the second day of the trial begins.
[1:07:55.680 --> 1:07:57.080]  Let's go ahead and go to that live feed.
[1:07:59.480 --> 1:08:01.480]  The Sergeant in Arms will make the proclamation.
[1:08:06.080 --> 1:08:08.080]  Hear ye, hear ye, hear ye.
[1:08:08.080 --> 1:08:13.600]  All persons are commanded to keep silent on pain of imprisonment while the
[1:08:13.600 --> 1:08:17.480]  Senate of the United States is sitting for the trial of the Articles of
[1:08:17.480 --> 1:08:22.200]  Impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against Donald John
[1:08:22.200 --> 1:08:24.760]  Trump, President of the United States.
[1:08:25.720 --> 1:08:29.320]  Mr. Chief Justice, the majority leader is recognized as the chaplain is
[1:08:29.320 --> 1:08:30.960]  indicated on behalf of all of us.
[1:08:31.080 --> 1:08:32.080]  Happy birthday.
[1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:35.840]  I'm sure this is exactly how you'd plan to celebrate the day.
[1:08:35.840 --> 1:08:39.240]  Well, thank you very much for those kind wishes, and thank you to all the
[1:08:39.240 --> 1:08:41.560]  senators for not asking for the yeas and nays.
[1:08:46.040 --> 1:08:49.320]  And for the information of all the senators, we should expect a break every
[1:08:49.320 --> 1:08:55.400]  two or three hours and then at six o'clock, a break for dinner.
[1:08:56.280 --> 1:09:00.600]  And with that, Mr. Chief Justice, I yield the floor.
[1:09:00.600 --> 1:09:04.880]  Pursuant to the provisions of Senate Resolution 483, the Council for the
[1:09:04.880 --> 1:09:09.080]  President have 22 hours and five minutes remaining to make the presentation
[1:09:09.080 --> 1:09:10.080]  of their case.
[1:09:10.080 --> 1:09:12.080]  The Senate will now hear you.
[1:09:13.080 --> 1:09:14.080]  Mr. Sekulow.
[1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:17.080]  Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice.
[1:09:17.600 --> 1:09:18.600]  Members of the Senate.
[1:09:20.600 --> 1:09:21.600]  Managers.
[1:09:21.600 --> 1:09:26.600]  What we've done on Saturday is the pattern that we're going to continue today
[1:09:26.600 --> 1:09:30.600]  as far as how we're going to deal with the case.
[1:09:31.600 --> 1:09:34.600]  We deal with transcript evidence.
[1:09:35.600 --> 1:09:39.600]  We deal with publicly available information.
[1:09:40.600 --> 1:09:42.600]  We do not deal with speculation.
[1:09:44.600 --> 1:09:45.600]  Allegedly.
[1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:50.600]  We do not deal with information.
[1:09:51.600 --> 1:09:53.600]  We do not deal with speculation.
[1:09:54.600 --> 1:09:59.600]  Allegations that are not based on evidentiary standards at all.
[1:10:02.600 --> 1:10:06.600]  We are going to highlight some of those very facts we talked about very
[1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:07.600]  quickly.
[1:10:08.600 --> 1:10:10.600]  On Saturday, you're going to hear more about that.
[1:10:10.600 --> 1:10:14.600]  I want to give you a little bit of an overview of what we plan to do
[1:10:14.600 --> 1:10:16.600]  for a number of lawyers.
[1:10:17.600 --> 1:10:21.600]  Each one of these lawyers will be addressing a particular aspect of the
[1:10:21.600 --> 1:10:22.600]  President's case.
[1:10:24.600 --> 1:10:27.600]  I will introduce the issues that they're going to discuss and then that
[1:10:27.600 --> 1:10:30.600]  individual lawyer will come up and make their presentation.
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:34.600]  We want to do this on an expeditious but yet thorough basis.
[1:10:36.600 --> 1:10:42.600]  Let me start with just for a very brief few moments to take a look at where
[1:10:42.600 --> 1:10:44.600]  we're going to go.
[1:10:46.600 --> 1:10:49.600]  One of the things that became very clear to us as we looked at the
[1:10:49.600 --> 1:10:54.600]  presentation from the House managers was the lack of focus on that July 25
[1:10:54.600 --> 1:10:55.600]  transcript.
[1:10:56.600 --> 1:10:59.600]  And that's because the transcript actually doesn't say what they would
[1:10:59.600 --> 1:11:00.600]  like it to say.
[1:11:01.600 --> 1:11:05.600]  Now we've heard and you will hear more about that in the days ahead.
[1:11:06.600 --> 1:11:10.600]  We know about Mr. Schiff's version of the transcript.
[1:11:10.600 --> 1:11:11.600]  You heard it.
[1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:12.600]  You saw it.
[1:11:13.600 --> 1:11:15.600]  I want to keep coming back to facts.
[1:11:16.600 --> 1:11:18.600]  Facts that are really undisputed.
[1:11:19.600 --> 1:11:25.600]  The President in his conversation was clear on a number of points.
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:27.600]  But so was President Zelinsky.
[1:11:27.600 --> 1:11:31.600]  I mentioned that at the close of my arguments earlier that it was
[1:11:31.600 --> 1:11:34.600]  President Zelinsky that said no pressure.
[1:11:35.600 --> 1:11:36.600]  I didn't feel any pressure.
[1:11:36.600 --> 1:11:40.600]  And again, it's this kind of reading of minds of what people were saying.
[1:11:40.600 --> 1:11:44.600]  I think we need to look at what they actually said and how it's backed up.
[1:11:46.600 --> 1:11:51.600]  It is our position as President's Council that the President was at all
[1:11:51.600 --> 1:11:56.600]  time acting under his constitutional authority, under his legal authority,
[1:11:56.600 --> 1:12:01.600]  international interest, and pursuant to his oath of office.
[1:12:01.600 --> 1:12:08.600]  Asking a foreign leader to get to the bottom of issues of corruption is not
[1:12:08.600 --> 1:12:09.600]  a violation of an oath.
[1:12:13.600 --> 1:12:15.600]  It was interesting because there was a lot of discussion the other day
[1:12:15.600 --> 1:12:17.600]  about Lieutenant Colonel Vindman.
[1:12:17.600 --> 1:12:21.600]  And one of the things that we reiterate is that he himself said
[1:12:21.600 --> 1:12:25.600]  he did not know if there was anything of crime or anything of that nature.
[1:12:25.600 --> 1:12:28.600]  He had deep policy concerns.
[1:12:28.600 --> 1:12:33.600]  I think that is what this is really about, is deep policy concerns,
[1:12:33.600 --> 1:12:35.600]  deep policy differences.
[1:12:36.600 --> 1:12:40.600]  We live in a constitutional republic where you have deep policy concerns
[1:12:40.600 --> 1:12:42.600]  and deep differences.
[1:12:42.600 --> 1:12:45.600]  That should not be the basis of an impeachment.
[1:12:45.600 --> 1:12:47.600]  If the bar of impeachment has now reached that level.
[1:12:47.600 --> 1:12:49.600]  Let's fade this down for a moment.
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:52.600]  We've all heard this 100 times in the last four months.
[1:12:52.600 --> 1:12:54.600]  We know Trump did nothing wrong.
[1:12:54.600 --> 1:12:58.600]  But what Seculo is getting on here is really deep.
[1:12:58.600 --> 1:13:00.600]  I hope he spells it out clearer.
[1:13:00.600 --> 1:13:05.600]  The deep state thinks it's America and thinks it runs our lives
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:09.600]  and thinks that if we elect a president that doesn't do what they want
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:12.600]  and doesn't let them run a big money laundering operation out of Ukraine
[1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:15.600]  for $5 billion a year, that we're bad guys.
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:16.600]  That's it.
[1:13:16.600 --> 1:13:20.600]  It's literally a Harvard and Yale mafia.
[1:13:20.600 --> 1:13:24.600]  I've got a Don Lemon clip where they're making fun of dumb Americans.
[1:13:24.600 --> 1:13:30.600]  They say Midwesterners don't know where Ukraine is on a map.
[1:13:30.600 --> 1:13:39.600]  And they all three sit there and laugh at dumb Midwesterners.
[1:13:39.600 --> 1:13:42.600]  What the hell does that even mean?
[1:13:42.600 --> 1:13:47.600]  I've been around the country, but Midwesterners are hard-working, smart people.
[1:13:47.600 --> 1:13:54.600]  But again, it's the elitism. These people think that 97% of the country
[1:13:54.600 --> 1:13:59.600]  geographically doesn't like them.
[1:13:59.600 --> 1:14:07.600]  I've got articles on the demographics here.
[1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:10.600]  Bloomberg's reporting on it.
[1:14:10.600 --> 1:14:19.600]  Yahoo News homesteaders run for the hills to flee U.S. uncertainty.
[1:14:19.600 --> 1:14:23.600]  And it's how all these big leftist and billionaires and others are fleeing
[1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:25.600]  believing a collapse is coming.
[1:14:25.600 --> 1:14:34.600]  Now, what I'm getting at here is I feel sorry for New York and San Francisco and L.A.
[1:14:34.600 --> 1:14:36.600]  There's a lot of good people living in those places.
[1:14:36.600 --> 1:14:51.600]  I don't just look at them all as elite scum because a bunch of globalist criminals run it.
[1:14:51.600 --> 1:14:56.600]  But when you see the disdain these people have, they believe they own us and they don't.
[1:14:56.600 --> 1:14:59.600]  Yeah, they found a Reuters article. Let's put that back on screen.
[1:14:59.600 --> 1:15:07.600]  Homesteaders and catastrophists run to the hills to flee U.S. uncertainty.
[1:15:07.600 --> 1:15:11.600]  And it's an article saying people are scared of tyranny.
[1:15:11.600 --> 1:15:18.600]  They're scared of the breakdown in the cities, the corruption they see, the taxation.
[1:15:18.600 --> 1:15:28.600]  And that, shockingly, it's a wide section of political beliefs.
[1:15:28.600 --> 1:15:35.600]  But see, even as the big cities collapse and reach their tentacles out towards us,
[1:15:35.600 --> 1:15:42.600]  they still laugh at us and hate us because we don't want to be in the grasp of these globalists in their new or older system.
[1:15:42.600 --> 1:15:47.600]  We don't want to take our five-year-olds in and have them sit on the lap of a big, fat obese man
[1:15:47.600 --> 1:15:51.600]  and hit the clown outfit so he can rub his abdomen on them.
[1:15:51.600 --> 1:15:55.600]  We don't want to just suck in the 5G and roll over and die.
[1:15:55.600 --> 1:15:58.600]  We can all agree these are troubled times, right?
[1:15:58.600 --> 1:16:01.600]  So do you know who's on your wireless network?
[1:16:01.600 --> 1:16:08.600]  Whether it's a big company selling your data or a foreign hacker, if you're not protected, everybody sees your information.

[1:18:14.600 --> 1:18:22.600]  They attack us, and they persecute us, and they lie about us. That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags.
[1:18:22.600 --> 1:18:28.600]  The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side, and they do what they do because they're slaves.
[1:18:28.600 --> 1:18:33.600]  Because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and destroy the innocent.
[1:18:33.600 --> 1:18:43.600]  It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants.
[1:18:43.600 --> 1:18:51.600]  They fear the fact that we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God.
[1:18:51.600 --> 1:18:55.600]  And that's all we ever have to know, is that God is in charge.
[1:18:55.600 --> 1:19:05.600]  It is I, the leader of Cobra here for a message to President Trump, the American people, and Alex Jones of InfoWars.
[1:19:05.600 --> 1:19:12.600]  Our operations with our partners, the Communist Chinese, have bought control of your media.
[1:19:12.600 --> 1:19:17.600]  But, it's true, your people are beginning to awaken.
[1:19:17.600 --> 1:19:28.600]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings, which will be blamed on those loyal to America.
[1:19:28.600 --> 1:19:37.600]  Anyone wants to stage these attacks, that does not blame it on Trump, will also be targeted by Cobra in the future.
[1:19:37.600 --> 1:19:53.600]  You see, when you expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks, and then blame you, like we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed.
[1:19:53.600 --> 1:20:08.600]  Ha, ha, ha, Helicopa!
[1:20:23.600 --> 1:20:27.600]  I don't despise
[1:20:27.600 --> 1:20:31.600]  Now all I could do
[1:20:31.600 --> 1:20:34.600]  Love was wrong
[1:20:34.600 --> 1:20:37.600]  So I knew you
[1:20:37.600 --> 1:20:39.600]  But it's gone from my heart
[1:20:39.600 --> 1:20:46.600]  During the break I was watching some of the senate defend the president and they're just pointing out how the democrats order the senate
[1:20:46.600 --> 1:20:54.600]  To do the trial a certain way and are still trying to dictate things and how that's unconstitutional and an abuse of power in the constitution
[1:20:54.600 --> 1:20:57.600]  That's what Professor Turley who's a liberal said
[1:20:57.600 --> 1:21:00.600]  This is what's illegal the way they've done the whole thing
[1:21:00.600 --> 1:21:06.600]  And now they're trying to tell the senate what to do
[1:21:06.600 --> 1:21:16.600]  That's why I said they should have just no build it and said no we're not even having the trial had a vote to not even have the trial because that legitimizes it
[1:21:16.600 --> 1:21:28.600]  You don't get to trial if it's proven that the prosecution planted evidence or didn't follow due process it's thrown out
[1:21:28.600 --> 1:21:32.600]  And we knew that once they got the trial going they'd launch a bunch of fiascos
[1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:38.600]  We knew John Bolton was the chief torpedo and now he's crawled out from under a rock
[1:21:38.600 --> 1:21:46.600]  The guy that helped lie about WMD's with the New York Times 17 years ago
[1:21:46.600 --> 1:21:50.600]  And now he's back with the New York Times with a new fiasco
[1:21:50.600 --> 1:21:54.600]  It's kind of like Ryan Williams got caught saying he got shot down in a helicopter and the whole thing was alive
[1:21:54.600 --> 1:22:00.600]  They just took him off as the main anchor for a few months and he's back full time
[1:22:00.600 --> 1:22:06.600]  Reporting on how info wars is fake news
[1:22:06.600 --> 1:22:14.600]  I mean if I ever said I got shot down in a helicopter and it wasn't true you'd be done with me forever you should be
[1:22:14.600 --> 1:22:20.600]  I mean if I told you that you know I'd been on a Mars mission and I hadn't been
[1:22:20.600 --> 1:22:26.600]  You'd know I was a damn liar and there's no value to me but they think you're an idiot
[1:22:26.600 --> 1:22:31.600]  But they know you're not an idiot, they know you want the truth, you want justice, you want hardcore information
[1:22:31.600 --> 1:22:33.600]  That's why they block info wars
[1:22:33.600 --> 1:22:37.600]  It's why they're trying to censor everybody now because they want to make us watch them
[1:22:37.600 --> 1:22:44.600]  But I want to tell the vile pukes at CNN and NBC and all of them you'll never get an audience again
[1:22:44.600 --> 1:22:52.600]  Everyone hates you, Hollywood is hated, the system is hated and you're a stinking joke
[1:22:52.600 --> 1:22:56.600]  I want to get back to some of the trial but
[1:22:56.600 --> 1:23:03.600]  I was already, this is synchronicity
[1:23:03.600 --> 1:23:08.600]  I was about to say is this synchronicity or is this serendipity
[1:23:08.600 --> 1:23:15.600]  Because it's crazy
[1:23:15.600 --> 1:23:21.600]  I was about to cover this article what you saw
[1:23:21.600 --> 1:23:28.600]  Right as we were going to break how all of these elites are running to the hills
[1:23:28.600 --> 1:23:37.600]  That's a big article out of Reuters
[1:23:37.600 --> 1:23:47.600]  And then Tim Friget ran in here during the break and he told me some very interesting information
[1:23:47.600 --> 1:23:53.600]  So I'm just going to stop right there because now that I think about I want to talk to Tim again before I announce this
[1:23:53.600 --> 1:23:56.600]  So I'll do this towards the end of the hour
[1:23:56.600 --> 1:24:00.600]  Let's go back to Ken Starr
[1:24:00.600 --> 1:24:04.600]  We are living in the age of impeachment, let's see what he's saying in the defense of the president right now
[1:24:04.600 --> 1:24:10.600]  The firing of a special prosecutor as he was called Archibald Cox by President Nixon
[1:24:10.600 --> 1:24:17.600]  Government would now be better, more honest, greater accountability
[1:24:17.600 --> 1:24:23.600]  And the independent council would be protected
[1:24:23.600 --> 1:24:29.600]  But the word impeachment haunts that dissenting opinion
[1:24:29.600 --> 1:24:33.600]  And it's not hard to discover why
[1:24:33.600 --> 1:24:46.600]  Because the statute by its terms expressly directed the independent council to become in effect an agent of the House of Representatives
[1:24:46.600 --> 1:24:48.600]  And it went in
[1:24:48.600 --> 1:24:56.600]  To report to the House of Representatives when a very low threshold of information was received
[1:24:56.600 --> 1:25:04.600]  An impeachable offense left undefined may have been committed
[1:25:04.600 --> 1:25:12.600]  To paraphrase President Clinton's very able counsel at the time, Bernie Nussbaum
[1:25:12.600 --> 1:25:20.600]  This statute is a dagger aimed at the heart of the presidency
[1:25:20.600 --> 1:25:26.600]  President Clinton nonetheless signed the reauthorized measure into law
[1:25:26.600 --> 1:25:32.600]  And the nation then went through the long process known as whitewater
[1:25:32.600 --> 1:25:39.600]  Resulting in the findings by the office which I led, the office of independent council
[1:25:39.600 --> 1:25:43.600]  And a written report to the House of Representatives
[1:25:43.600 --> 1:25:51.600]  That referral to Congress was stipulated in the Ethics and Government Act of 1978
[1:25:51.600 --> 1:25:59.600]  To put it mildly, Democrats were very upset about what had happened
[1:25:59.600 --> 1:26:10.600]  They then joined Republicans across the aisle who for their part had been outraged by an earlier independent council investigation
[1:26:10.600 --> 1:26:15.600]  That of a very distinguished former judge, Lawrence Walsh
[1:26:15.600 --> 1:26:23.600]  During the Reagan administration, Judge Walsh's investigation of what became known to the country is Iran-Contra
[1:26:23.600 --> 1:26:25.600]  Spawned enormous criticism
[1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:33.600]  I'm going to make a call here. I think listeners think this is like watching paint dry
[1:26:33.600 --> 1:26:42.600]  Because this is the Senate hearing the technicals of impeachment itself and how this doesn't reach the threshold
[1:26:42.600 --> 1:26:46.600]  This whole thing is a fraud and it's a dangerous direction for our country to go
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:51.600]  Because the bureaucracy is just going to try to hamstring and remove the presidency
[1:26:51.600 --> 1:26:59.600]  By everything but name only, making it ceremonial where it cannot be its own branch of government to balance out the other two
[1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:05.600]  If they empower the threshold to be so low
[1:27:05.600 --> 1:27:10.600]  They need to be attacking the deep state, they need to be exposing crossfire hurricane
[1:27:10.600 --> 1:27:20.600]  They need to be putting up front the story of how this is to meddle in the election and is a criminal fraud
[1:27:20.600 --> 1:27:30.600]  Not going through technicals of how this is not legally to the threshold
[1:27:30.600 --> 1:27:36.600]  Because the whole thing has been about the Democrats grandstanding like they're in charge and they're the good guys
[1:27:36.600 --> 1:27:39.600]  And they're fighting evil and Trump is illegitimate
[1:27:39.600 --> 1:27:53.600]  You've got a bunch of lawyers going in, being lawyers again, countering a completely illegitimate fraudulent PR move with a bunch of pure legal theory
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:28:00.600]  Which I'm sure in the austere body of the U.S. Senate will have them acquit the president
[1:28:00.600 --> 1:28:07.600]  But it will only encourage the Democrats to pull this scam again, which they said they're planning to do if Trump gets reelected
[1:28:07.600 --> 1:28:13.600]  They need stinging defeat, they need to be rebuked, they need to be punished
[1:28:13.600 --> 1:28:15.600]  And that's what Trump said over the weekend in a tweet
[1:28:15.600 --> 1:28:25.600]  He said, when is shift going to be punished for all the obstruction of things and the lies and the fraud and reading fake transcripts and doing all this crap?
[1:28:25.600 --> 1:28:30.600]  And shift goes out, you're threatening me
[1:28:30.600 --> 1:28:35.600]  And then shift says, Trump said he'll put their heads on pike so they don't do what he wants
[1:28:35.600 --> 1:28:37.600]  Never said that, never did it
[1:28:37.600 --> 1:28:39.600]  Then people said, oh that'd be a threat if he said that
[1:28:39.600 --> 1:28:41.600]  It's a figure of speech
[1:28:41.600 --> 1:28:46.600]  The Democrats are trying to get me arrested in Connecticut for saying, put somebody's head on a pike
[1:28:46.600 --> 1:28:48.600]  And that was a nebulous person
[1:28:48.600 --> 1:28:51.600]  I said, whoever sent us the child porn, I want their head on a pike
[1:28:51.600 --> 1:29:06.600]  These people are monsters
[1:29:21.600 --> 1:29:24.600]  That's Black Rifle Real Estate.com
[1:29:51.600 --> 1:29:54.600]  Feel the thrill, only at Slingbow.com
[1:30:22.600 --> 1:30:31.600]  This is a whitening toothpaste that also has the above sea coral calcium that also cleans but also re-mineralizes the teeth
[1:30:31.600 --> 1:30:36.600]  Then it has the patented silver salt, silver in it to knock out the bacteria that causes ginsivitis
[1:30:36.600 --> 1:30:38.600]  This is all proven, you can make claims with this
[1:30:38.600 --> 1:30:50.600]  But I have to tell you, no one has a toothpaste this good for knocking out the bacteria, the viruses, and cleaning the teeth in a healthy way that doesn't strip away the enamel
[1:30:50.600 --> 1:30:54.600]  So, we're really proud of it, it funds the operation, infowarsstore.com

[1:31:42.600 --> 1:31:45.600]  And you know that's not just words, that's reality
[1:31:45.600 --> 1:31:48.600]  You have made history, we have made history together
[1:31:48.600 --> 1:31:53.600]  Infowars.com only has power because of you
[1:31:53.600 --> 1:31:57.600]  And I suggest you use it
[1:31:57.600 --> 1:32:00.600]  This should really be easier than it is
[1:32:00.600 --> 1:32:02.600]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch
[1:32:02.600 --> 1:32:05.600]  I'm pointing out the way forward
[1:32:05.600 --> 1:32:08.600]  Things that I've discovered that I absolutely know work
[1:32:08.600 --> 1:32:12.600]  That if you listen to me and try them out for yourself
[1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:14.600]  You will see how amazing it is

[1:32:19.600 --> 1:32:22.600]  And will help us and it's symbiotic
[1:32:22.600 --> 1:32:25.600]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine
[1:32:25.600 --> 1:32:28.600]  Because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen
[1:32:28.600 --> 1:32:31.600]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen
[1:32:31.600 --> 1:32:34.600]  And I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group
[1:32:34.600 --> 1:32:40.600]  Like eight years ago I started taking true iodine, atomic iodine
[1:32:40.600 --> 1:32:44.600]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now
[1:32:44.600 --> 1:32:47.600]  At InfowarsTour.com and I'm telling you folks

[1:33:22.600 --> 1:33:27.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance
[1:33:27.600 --> 1:33:41.600]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones
[1:33:41.600 --> 1:33:47.600]  Ladies and gentlemen we've got some really important news to cover right now
[1:33:47.600 --> 1:33:55.600]  This weekend I saw the headline in 95 virus mass shell out across the United States
[1:33:55.600 --> 1:33:59.600]  And I've been told that by folks when I was buying some extra ones just last week
[1:33:59.600 --> 1:34:02.600]  That they were running low
[1:34:02.600 --> 1:34:05.600]  I also noticed that storable food prices were spiking
[1:34:05.600 --> 1:34:10.600]  But we kept ours at the lowest you're going to find anywhere at InfowarsTour.com
[1:34:10.600 --> 1:34:18.600]  But then Tim Fruget, the manager of the warehouse came walking in a few breaks ago
[1:34:18.600 --> 1:34:24.600]  And he said listen, I just got some really disturbing news from my patriot supply
[1:34:24.600 --> 1:34:31.600]  He said I just got some really disturbing news from my patriot supply
[1:34:31.600 --> 1:34:36.600]  That we private label the Infowars high quality storable food from
[1:34:36.600 --> 1:34:38.600]  It's the very same stuff right off the same line
[1:34:38.600 --> 1:34:43.600]  It's just that we can contractually get around their normal lowest price
[1:34:43.600 --> 1:34:47.600]  By private labeling and have an even lower price out there in the marketplace
[1:34:47.600 --> 1:34:49.600]  And that's always been my business tactic
[1:34:49.600 --> 1:34:53.600]  But let me just get back to the news here
[1:34:53.600 --> 1:34:59.600]  I noticed that the N95 virus mass have sold out across the United States
[1:34:59.600 --> 1:35:04.600]  I noticed that storable food prices were spiking
[1:35:04.600 --> 1:35:08.600]  I noticed there were reports that food prices in general were going to be going up
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:12.600]  Because of the crisis in China and surrounding areas
[1:35:12.600 --> 1:35:15.600]  And with how deadly this coronavirus is
[1:35:15.600 --> 1:35:17.600]  And then I started seeing headlines like this one
[1:35:17.600 --> 1:35:23.600]  Homesteaders, catastrophes run for the hills to flee U.S. uncertainty
[1:35:23.600 --> 1:35:26.600]  That's out of Reuters
[1:35:26.600 --> 1:35:34.600]  And I'm sitting back looking at what's happening, the stock market going down and all the rest of it
[1:35:34.600 --> 1:35:37.600]  And knowing how deadly this virus is
[1:35:37.600 --> 1:35:44.600]  And then all of a sudden Tim comes walking in and he says
[1:35:44.600 --> 1:35:48.600]  Wiping his brow just like I just did
[1:35:48.600 --> 1:35:52.600]  We just talked to Matt Redhawk, his longtime friend
[1:35:52.600 --> 1:35:56.600]  And the owner of my Patriot supply and a Patriot
[1:35:56.600 --> 1:36:00.600]  And I said, let me guess
[1:36:00.600 --> 1:36:02.600]  They're running out of storable food
[1:36:02.600 --> 1:36:05.600]  They're having to pay a lot more to buy food currently
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:08.600]  And everybody else has already run out
[1:36:08.600 --> 1:36:10.600]  Because I know that my Patriot keeps a big supply on hand
[1:36:10.600 --> 1:36:12.600]  They're one of the largest in the country
[1:36:12.600 --> 1:36:14.600]  They've become one of the largest in just 10 years
[1:36:14.600 --> 1:36:17.600]  Because they sell things at really good prices
[1:36:17.600 --> 1:36:20.600]  But without going on forever
[1:36:20.600 --> 1:36:24.600]  It's just another sign of how serious everything is
[1:36:24.600 --> 1:36:27.600]  Because they were telling us, because we have an agreement with them
[1:36:27.600 --> 1:36:31.600]  Hey, you can't have that sales price at that level anymore
[1:36:31.600 --> 1:36:36.600]  Because we're having to go out and buy food at much higher prices
[1:36:36.600 --> 1:36:41.600]  And so that's where in the supply chain you get the news that this is really serious
[1:36:41.600 --> 1:36:47.600]  And so during the break I went and found out more about how institutional buyers, big corporations
[1:36:47.600 --> 1:36:52.600]  And state connected groups are buying from our supplier
[1:36:52.600 --> 1:36:57.600]  And from other suppliers, and that's why the other ones have run out
[1:36:57.600 --> 1:37:00.600]  And aren't even able to ship for folks
[1:37:00.600 --> 1:37:04.600]  But we are within 7 to 10 days
[1:37:04.600 --> 1:37:08.600]  But this is getting delayed with each passing minute
[1:37:08.600 --> 1:37:09.600]  So secure your spot now
[1:37:09.600 --> 1:37:13.600]  Other suppliers aren't able to ship at all due to the huge demand
[1:37:13.600 --> 1:37:18.600]  And really that's the takeaway is that the gas mask we're selling out
[1:37:18.600 --> 1:37:20.600]  A lot of medical supplies are starting to sell out
[1:37:20.600 --> 1:37:28.600]  And organizations, corporations and groups are stocking up particularly on the west coast
[1:37:28.600 --> 1:37:35.600]  And are expecting that the coronavirus is going to end up wreaking some serious havoc here in the United States
[1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:41.600]  And I just don't know why the average American doesn't know how important it is to have borders
[1:37:41.600 --> 1:37:43.600]  Or how the left portrays it that way
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:49.600]  That any type of border control or any type of screening from countries that have diseases in them is a bad thing
[1:37:49.600 --> 1:37:53.600]  Latin America has incredible diseases pouring into the US
[1:37:53.600 --> 1:37:55.600]  It's hurting the American people
[1:37:55.600 --> 1:38:01.600]  Every race, color and creed, it's causing massive crises in local medical systems
[1:38:01.600 --> 1:38:05.600]  And bankrupting many of them and driving up healthcare prices
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:07.600]  And we all know this
[1:38:07.600 --> 1:38:11.600]  As if it's not bad enough having to pay for hundreds of thousands of sex change operations
[1:38:11.600 --> 1:38:14.600]  Which aren't sex changes when they cut your tallywacker off
[1:38:14.600 --> 1:38:16.600]  You're just a psycho
[1:38:16.600 --> 1:38:20.600]  All of this, ladies and gentlemen, is completely out of control
[1:38:20.600 --> 1:38:23.600]  And we're paying for millions of abortions every year
[1:38:23.600 --> 1:38:24.600]  Taxpayers are
[1:38:24.600 --> 1:38:27.600]  Thank God Trump's just cut the funding of that down to zero
[1:38:27.600 --> 1:38:29.600]  That's something real Trump did again
[1:38:29.600 --> 1:38:31.600]  But it's just crazy
[1:38:31.600 --> 1:38:33.600]  And I don't want to say I'm overwhelmed
[1:38:33.600 --> 1:38:37.600]  But the crises that are starting to unfold are so serious
[1:38:37.600 --> 1:38:39.600]  And they're all interconnected
[1:38:39.600 --> 1:38:42.600]  And you just know that 2020 is going to be one insane year
[1:38:42.600 --> 1:38:44.600]  So I would just tell listeners
[1:38:44.600 --> 1:38:46.600]  You can always eat your insurance
[1:38:46.600 --> 1:38:47.600]  Hope you never need it
[1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:49.600]  This stuff's really good
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:53.600]  We've even had vice and others do reviews and say, wow, historical food's really good
[1:38:53.600 --> 1:38:55.600]  Yeah, it's great
[1:38:55.600 --> 1:38:59.600]  You can buy stuff that costs five times more that's gourmet that tastes better
[1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:02.600]  But for quality food that tastes good
[1:39:02.600 --> 1:39:04.600]  This is the lowest price you're going to find anywhere
[1:39:04.600 --> 1:39:07.600]  Even when it's at its regular price
[1:39:07.600 --> 1:39:09.600]  And that's the news
[1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:12.600]  My patriots philosophies have the lowest price on quality food
[1:39:12.600 --> 1:39:15.600]  They have to raise their price to their normal regular
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:17.600]  My special deal has to end
[1:39:17.600 --> 1:39:19.600]  We just raise prices to match theirs
[1:39:19.600 --> 1:39:24.600]  Because they're having to go out to the market and buy food at substantively increased prices
[1:39:24.600 --> 1:39:26.600]  And so that's really the boil down here is
[1:39:26.600 --> 1:39:28.600]  You see the
[1:39:28.600 --> 1:39:31.600]  You see the virus mass selling out
[1:39:31.600 --> 1:39:33.600]  You see the
[1:39:33.600 --> 1:39:37.600]  Shipping starting to come to a stand still out of China
[1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:41.600]  Even if you're not buying food that comes out of China, which I recommend you don't
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:46.600]  When they stop shipping, that means other places will up their shipping
[1:39:46.600 --> 1:39:50.600]  And other supply chains will run down fast as well
[1:39:50.600 --> 1:39:52.600]  And so that's the big takeaway here is
[1:39:52.600 --> 1:39:54.600]  With just on time delivery
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:39:57.600]  And all the rest of the stuff going on in our society
[1:39:57.600 --> 1:39:59.600]  People need to stock up on food
[1:39:59.600 --> 1:40:01.600]  They need to stock up on water filtration
[1:40:01.600 --> 1:40:04.600]  They need to stock up on ammo
[1:40:04.600 --> 1:40:08.600]  And need to have a plan with your friends and family and neighbors about what you're going to do
[1:40:08.600 --> 1:40:10.600]  Because you could feel it in your bones
[1:40:10.600 --> 1:40:12.600]  The big stuff's coming down
[1:40:12.600 --> 1:40:15.600]  Whether it's this coronavirus or something else
[1:40:15.600 --> 1:40:17.600]  Now is the time to get prepared
[1:40:17.600 --> 1:40:20.600]  And I suggest folks get their storeable food at infoarstore.com
[1:40:20.600 --> 1:40:22.600]  While you still can
[1:40:22.600 --> 1:40:25.600]  Other places will tell you they've got the food on hand
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:28.600]  They'll tell you it's going to be shipped in a few weeks, but that's not the case
[1:40:28.600 --> 1:40:31.600]  I went out and I got my Patreon
[1:40:31.600 --> 1:40:34.600]  Because we'd have good food sponsors
[1:40:34.600 --> 1:40:38.600]  Then they'd get sold to somebody else and they wouldn't be good anymore
[1:40:38.600 --> 1:40:42.600]  And so finally when I found a place and I bought some from them
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:46.600]  And then I worked with them a few years before I ever even had them as sponsors
[1:40:46.600 --> 1:40:50.600]  And now they've been sponsors for ten years or so
[1:40:50.600 --> 1:40:53.600]  And so that's why I said I want a private label of your food
[1:40:53.600 --> 1:40:55.600]  I want to sell it, we have their full spectrum
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:40:58.600]  All they do is at the factory they stick our sticker on it
[1:40:58.600 --> 1:41:00.600]  So it's their full catalog
[1:41:00.600 --> 1:41:03.600]  infoarstore.com
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:05.600]  And they say seven to ten days
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:07.600]  But they're saying that could change by tomorrow
[1:41:07.600 --> 1:41:10.600]  You get your order in now, you'll get it within seven to ten days
[1:41:10.600 --> 1:41:11.600]  They always do what they say they're going to do
[1:41:11.600 --> 1:41:13.600]  Unless there's an earthquake or something in Utah
[1:41:13.600 --> 1:41:17.600]  But these are good Christian hardworking people that do what they say they're going to do
[1:41:17.600 --> 1:41:20.600]  And I personally have been buying more gas masks
[1:41:20.600 --> 1:41:23.600]  I personally have gotten extra water filtration
[1:41:23.600 --> 1:41:26.600]  I personally have ordered more swarble food just last week
[1:41:26.600 --> 1:41:30.600]  Because I've been able to take care of not just myself but my neighbors
[1:41:30.600 --> 1:41:35.600]  Because believe me, hungry starving neighbors are not a good thing to have
[1:41:35.600 --> 1:41:38.600]  And so it's simple, you better hide your food
[1:41:38.600 --> 1:41:40.600]  Or you better have extra
[1:41:40.600 --> 1:41:43.600]  Because just because you live out in the country doesn't mean you're going to be safe either
[1:41:43.600 --> 1:41:45.600]  If society breaks down
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:48.600]  I'm going to say this again
[1:41:48.600 --> 1:41:52.600]  Half the public was self-sufficient
[1:41:52.600 --> 1:41:55.600]  During the Great Depression
[1:41:55.600 --> 1:41:57.600]  90% of folks live in the country
[1:41:57.600 --> 1:42:03.600]  A little bit more than half of them were completely self-sufficient
[1:42:03.600 --> 1:42:07.600]  Today about 87% live in the city
[1:42:07.600 --> 1:42:10.600]  And a very small percentage of those in the country are self-sufficient
[1:42:10.600 --> 1:42:13.600]  So maybe 5% of the public is self-sufficient
[1:42:13.600 --> 1:42:16.600]  If we have another Great Depression in this country
[1:42:16.600 --> 1:42:18.600]  And if supply chains break down
[1:42:18.600 --> 1:42:21.600]  It is a recipe for mega-death
[1:42:21.600 --> 1:42:23.600]  17 million people, it's estimated
[1:42:23.600 --> 1:42:25.600]  By major university studies
[1:42:25.600 --> 1:42:28.600]  Starved to death during the Great Depression in this country
[1:42:28.600 --> 1:42:32.600]  And that's when people were self-sufficient
[1:42:32.600 --> 1:42:34.600]  And there was a food base, an agricultural system
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:37.600]  And folks knew how to skin a buck or run a trot line
[1:42:37.600 --> 1:42:38.600]  They don't today
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:40.600]  So I suggest you get the Alexa Pure
[1:42:40.600 --> 1:42:42.600]  A water filtration system at m4store.com
[1:42:42.600 --> 1:42:44.600]  It's still discounted, don't know how long
[1:42:44.600 --> 1:42:46.600]  They've got a good supply of those for now
[1:42:46.600 --> 1:42:48.600]  And you get your swarble foods now while you can
[1:42:48.600 --> 1:42:50.600]  And support the m4 in your own family

[1:44:20.600 --> 1:44:21.600]  Satanism is real
[1:44:21.600 --> 1:44:22.600]  The pedophile a leader real
[1:44:22.600 --> 1:44:23.600]  But we're real as well
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:24.600]  And we love God
[1:44:24.600 --> 1:44:26.600]  And we're standing up and saying no
[1:44:26.600 --> 1:44:28.600]  But I just want to make the point here
[1:44:28.600 --> 1:44:29.600]  One month into 2020
[1:44:29.600 --> 1:44:31.600]  That we have never been in Kansas
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:33.600]  We have never been in some small
[1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:35.600]  Ville place that didn't matter
[1:44:35.600 --> 1:44:37.600]  Everything we do, every decision we make
[1:44:37.600 --> 1:44:39.600]  Governs the future of our species
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:41.600]  And everything we've gone through
[1:44:41.600 --> 1:44:42.600]  And everything we're going to go through

[1:44:43.600 --> 1:44:45.600]  I'm going to thank you all for being aware

[1:47:27.600 --> 1:47:31.600]  Live from the infowars.com studios
[1:47:31.600 --> 1:47:35.600]  It's Alex Jones
[1:47:35.600 --> 1:47:37.600]  All right
[1:47:37.600 --> 1:47:40.600]  Just over the weekend we reported
[1:47:40.600 --> 1:47:43.600]  That the cases of coronavirus
[1:47:43.600 --> 1:47:45.600]  Could possibly be 10 times higher
[1:47:45.600 --> 1:47:48.600]  Than the official number
[1:47:48.600 --> 1:47:50.600]  Now it's being confirmed
[1:47:50.600 --> 1:47:53.600]  Wuhan coronavirus update
[1:47:53.600 --> 1:47:54.600]  4,000 now infected
[1:47:54.600 --> 1:47:56.600]  Warned University of Hong Kong
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:47:58.600]  Researchers and this article
[1:47:58.600 --> 1:48:01.600]  From natural news links to mainstream news
[1:48:01.600 --> 1:48:03.600]  In Hong Kong
[1:48:03.600 --> 1:48:05.600]  Of course it's way worse than they've been saying
[1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:07.600]  You've seen the people dropping dead
[1:48:07.600 --> 1:48:08.600]  And falling down
[1:48:08.600 --> 1:48:10.600]  And the hospital's totally jammed
[1:48:10.600 --> 1:48:12.600]  And dead bodies lying in the corners
[1:48:12.600 --> 1:48:14.600]  And all this craziness
[1:48:14.600 --> 1:48:16.600]  This is big
[1:48:16.600 --> 1:48:18.600]  With major studies completely locked down
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:21.600]  Residents left in Wuhan
[1:48:21.600 --> 1:48:24.600]  Which China quarantined to stop the coronavirus
[1:48:24.600 --> 1:48:27.600]  Are desperately stop piling food and fuel
[1:48:27.600 --> 1:48:31.600]  Leaving empty shelves and prices
[1:48:31.600 --> 1:48:33.600]  Skyrocketing
[1:48:33.600 --> 1:48:35.600]  Wuhan coronavirus lockdown
[1:48:35.600 --> 1:48:37.600]  We've got enough food to last 10 days
[1:48:37.600 --> 1:48:41.600]  That was 4 days ago
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:46.600]  Last week there I was ordering
[1:48:46.600 --> 1:48:48.600]  Mask and more food
[1:48:48.600 --> 1:48:50.600]  And I didn't even come on air and do it myself
[1:48:50.600 --> 1:48:52.600]  Because there's that feeling of like
[1:48:52.600 --> 1:48:55.600]  Well, I'm pushing it during a crisis
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:48:57.600]  Of course we should promote this during a crisis
[1:48:57.600 --> 1:48:59.600]  It's all the more reason to get prepared
[1:48:59.600 --> 1:49:02.600]  And get ready, ladies and gentlemen
[1:49:02.600 --> 1:49:04.600]  I hope this thing peters out
[1:49:04.600 --> 1:49:07.600]  But it doesn't look like that
[1:49:07.600 --> 1:49:10.600]  It looks like it's going to get really, really bad
[1:49:10.600 --> 1:49:12.600]  And people need to have water filtration
[1:49:12.600 --> 1:49:14.600]  They need to have storeable food
[1:49:14.600 --> 1:49:16.600]  We've got the very best units out there
[1:49:16.600 --> 1:49:19.600]  And as I told you, I got this call 30 minutes ago
[1:49:19.600 --> 1:49:22.600]  Confirmed it from our great food supplier
[1:49:22.600 --> 1:49:25.600]  That produces the InfoWars Select food line
[1:49:25.600 --> 1:49:27.600]  The entire line of my patriots supply
[1:49:27.600 --> 1:49:29.600]  And they said, man, it's the worst ever
[1:49:29.600 --> 1:49:31.600]  All the other big suppliers they know
[1:49:31.600 --> 1:49:33.600]  Have sold out, can't get food
[1:49:33.600 --> 1:49:35.600]  They are buying ahead a ton of food
[1:49:35.600 --> 1:49:37.600]  But the prices have skyrocketed
[1:49:37.600 --> 1:49:39.600]  And that's in the news as well
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:41.600]  If you lock it in now
[1:49:41.600 --> 1:49:43.600]  You will get the food within 7 to 10 days
[1:49:43.600 --> 1:49:45.600]  And the price won't go up
[1:49:45.600 --> 1:49:48.600]  But he said that it may by tomorrow
[1:49:48.600 --> 1:49:50.600]  Be longer if your order gets in later
[1:49:50.600 --> 1:49:51.600]  Until you get it
[1:49:51.600 --> 1:49:53.600]  And we may have to raise prices
[1:49:53.600 --> 1:49:55.600]  Yet again, it's just gone back to regular price
[1:49:55.600 --> 1:49:56.600]  That's still a great deal
[1:49:56.600 --> 1:49:57.600]  He was calling us to say, listen
[1:49:57.600 --> 1:49:59.600]  It's probably because you didn't call me the last week
[1:49:59.600 --> 1:50:00.600]  You saw a lot of food, aren't you?
[1:50:00.600 --> 1:50:02.600]  And I'm like, yeah
[1:50:02.600 --> 1:50:04.600]  Talking to them during the break
[1:50:04.600 --> 1:50:07.600]  Well, we're having to buy out now
[1:50:07.600 --> 1:50:09.600]  You can sell out of that food at that price if you want
[1:50:09.600 --> 1:50:11.600]  But we're having to buy out now
[1:50:11.600 --> 1:50:13.600]  Because it's all basically been sold out
[1:50:13.600 --> 1:50:15.600]  And other people aren't able to do this
[1:50:15.600 --> 1:50:17.600]  So you're going to have to raise prices
[1:50:17.600 --> 1:50:19.600]  I said, well, I totally understand
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:21.600]  Because we had the lowest prices
[1:50:21.600 --> 1:50:23.600]  Of the entire MyPatriot supply system
[1:50:23.600 --> 1:50:24.600]  But that's how I worked it
[1:50:24.600 --> 1:50:26.600]  So take advantage of this now
[1:50:26.600 --> 1:50:28.600]  At m4store.com
[1:50:28.600 --> 1:50:29.600]  If you get your order in now
[1:50:29.600 --> 1:50:31.600]  It'll be there within 7 to 10 days
[1:50:31.600 --> 1:50:33.600]  And he doesn't think you'll have to raise prices
[1:50:33.600 --> 1:50:35.600]  For 4 or 5 days
[1:50:35.600 --> 1:50:37.600]  And hopefully this thing isn't as bad as it looks like
[1:50:37.600 --> 1:50:40.600]  Because again, that's what I'm really concerned about
[1:50:40.600 --> 1:50:42.600]  Is my family personally
[1:50:42.600 --> 1:50:44.600]  Again, I was going to go on vacation next week
[1:50:44.600 --> 1:50:45.600]  With my children
[1:50:45.600 --> 1:50:47.600]  I was going to work some during it
[1:50:47.600 --> 1:50:51.600]  But it looks like that may not happen now
[1:50:51.600 --> 1:50:54.600]  That's how bad and how serious this is
[1:50:54.600 --> 1:50:56.600]  And at a certain point, I've just gotten overwhelmed
[1:50:56.600 --> 1:50:58.600]  People are like, hey, you're pretty relaxed
[1:50:58.600 --> 1:51:00.600]  All this is going on
[1:51:00.600 --> 1:51:01.600]  This stuff's gotten so insane
[1:51:01.600 --> 1:51:03.600]  I'm just giving it to God
[1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:04.600]  And God's saying to me, you need to get prepared
[1:51:04.600 --> 1:51:06.600]  You need to get ready
[1:51:06.600 --> 1:51:08.600]  So again, m4store.com

[1:51:11.600 --> 1:51:13.600]  Highest rated out there

[1:51:14.600 --> 1:51:16.600]  But because we're already in a crisis
[1:51:16.600 --> 1:51:17.600]  About poison the water
[1:51:17.600 --> 1:51:18.600]  As everyone should be doing it
[1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:20.600]  And your purchase funds the operation
[1:51:20.600 --> 1:51:22.600]  I've done plugging
[1:51:22.600 --> 1:51:24.600]  I talked about this last segment
[1:51:24.600 --> 1:51:25.600]  And then I've got all this news
[1:51:25.600 --> 1:51:27.600]  And I was planning to go to the trial
[1:51:27.600 --> 1:51:30.600]  And got a special guest coming up
[1:51:30.600 --> 1:51:32.600]  And now all I'm thinking about is the coronavirus
[1:51:32.600 --> 1:51:39.600]  I personally can't get it out of my mind
[1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:41.600]  So that's why I'm kind of having trouble today
[1:51:41.600 --> 1:51:42.600]  Talking about other topics
[1:51:42.600 --> 1:51:45.600]  Is I'm very, very distracted right now
[1:51:45.600 --> 1:51:47.600]  In fact, we have a guest coming on
[1:51:47.600 --> 1:51:50.600]  Who's very smart, very pretty
[1:51:50.600 --> 1:51:51.600]  And that's always nice
[1:51:51.600 --> 1:51:52.600]  I'll be honest when I'm here on air
[1:51:52.600 --> 1:51:54.600]  Is to talk to a nice, lovely lady
[1:51:54.600 --> 1:51:57.600]  Who's running against a very evil lady, Nancy Pelosi
[1:51:57.600 --> 1:51:59.600]  And then I'm very tempted just to cancel that
[1:51:59.600 --> 1:52:01.600]  Or move it because
[1:52:01.600 --> 1:52:06.600]  I want to open the phones up on coronavirus
[1:52:06.600 --> 1:52:07.600]  We'll at least get her on for one second
[1:52:07.600 --> 1:52:12.600]  But then we'll open the phones up for coronavirus
[1:52:12.600 --> 1:52:14.600]  I think this is going to be really bad, folks
[1:52:14.600 --> 1:52:18.600]  It's already bad if you're in China
[1:52:18.600 --> 1:52:20.600]  Because my gut level feeling
[1:52:20.600 --> 1:52:22.600]  I feel exhausted by it
[1:52:22.600 --> 1:52:23.600]  Just when I think about it
[1:52:23.600 --> 1:52:25.600]  It's like, oh, like, something you don't want to face
[1:52:25.600 --> 1:52:27.600]  You know what I mean?
[1:52:27.600 --> 1:52:28.600]  But something nagging
[1:52:28.600 --> 1:52:30.600]  And like, I was asked to myself this weekend
[1:52:30.600 --> 1:52:31.600]  Like, why aren't you pushing
[1:52:31.600 --> 1:52:33.600]  Storeable food during this crisis?
[1:52:33.600 --> 1:52:35.600]  You know, people always need a reason to get ready
[1:52:35.600 --> 1:52:36.600]  That's when people buy food
[1:52:36.600 --> 1:52:39.600]  I just didn't want it to be real, you know what I mean?
[1:52:39.600 --> 1:52:40.600]  Because you've probably noticed
[1:52:40.600 --> 1:52:41.600]  We haven't been very alarmist
[1:52:41.600 --> 1:52:43.600]  Even though the headlines have been very alarmist
[1:52:43.600 --> 1:52:45.600]  And have been confirmed
[1:52:45.600 --> 1:52:47.600]  And now it's pretty much a bio weapon
[1:52:47.600 --> 1:52:48.600]  Even mainstream news is saying that
[1:52:48.600 --> 1:52:52.600]  And we're like, is this the sucker punch
[1:52:52.600 --> 1:52:54.600]  Against Trump in America?
[1:52:54.600 --> 1:52:56.600]  Because this is already hurting the U.S. economy
[1:52:56.600 --> 1:53:00.600]  In fact, let's look and see where the stock market is
[1:53:00.600 --> 1:53:04.600]  Last time I checked it was down 400 points or whatever
[1:53:04.600 --> 1:53:08.600]  You start getting thousands and thousands dead a week from this
[1:53:08.600 --> 1:53:09.600]  And it keeps spreading
[1:53:09.600 --> 1:53:14.600]  And it's got an infection rate as high as lands it says
[1:53:14.600 --> 1:53:19.600]  I mean, folks, lands that came out in a study
[1:53:19.600 --> 1:53:21.600]  An emergency study they did
[1:53:21.600 --> 1:53:24.600]  And they said that it has a super high infection rate
[1:53:24.600 --> 1:53:29.600]  And death rate
[1:53:29.600 --> 1:53:33.600]  I've got a whole folder on it actually right here
[1:53:33.600 --> 1:53:35.600]  And it just makes me ask the question
[1:53:35.600 --> 1:53:38.600]  How bad is this going to get?
[1:53:38.600 --> 1:53:39.600]  Look at this headline
[1:53:39.600 --> 1:53:42.600]  Nobody can leave trapped Wuhan residents stock up
[1:53:42.600 --> 1:53:44.600]  Coronavirus victim arrives around
[1:53:44.600 --> 1:53:46.600]  And shakes uncontrollable hospital trolley
[1:53:46.600 --> 1:53:48.600]  Coronavirus victim
[1:53:48.600 --> 1:53:51.600]  And it goes on, 56 million quarantined
[1:53:51.600 --> 1:53:56.600]  In China as evidence amounts, government plot
[1:53:56.600 --> 1:53:58.600]  Coronavirus, it's 15% fatality rate
[1:53:58.600 --> 1:54:01.600]  83% infection rate for those exposed
[1:54:01.600 --> 1:54:06.600]  Landsic emergency study
[1:54:06.600 --> 1:54:08.600]  We just, that's got to be wrong though
[1:54:08.600 --> 1:54:11.600]  I mean, there's just no way
[1:54:11.600 --> 1:54:14.600]  Hopefully it's because the sample rate is so low
[1:54:14.600 --> 1:54:16.600]  Of who they looked at that that's skewed
[1:54:16.600 --> 1:54:17.600]  I mean, it's got to be
[1:54:17.600 --> 1:54:23.600]  15% fatality rate
[1:54:23.600 --> 1:54:25.600]  Hmm
[1:54:25.600 --> 1:54:29.600]  83% infection rate
[1:54:29.600 --> 1:54:31.600]  New research cast doubt that Coronavirus
[1:54:31.600 --> 1:54:33.600]  Started in Wuhan food market
[1:54:33.600 --> 1:54:34.600]  Of course it did
[1:54:34.600 --> 1:54:38.600]  It started in a bio weapons lab
[1:54:38.600 --> 1:54:42.600]  Look, yesterday it was 1,300 cases
[1:54:42.600 --> 1:54:44.600]  I forgot to give you this headline
[1:54:44.600 --> 1:54:51.600]  Now they're reporting it's 40,000 cases
[1:54:51.600 --> 1:54:53.600]  That's coming out of Hong Kong
[1:54:53.600 --> 1:54:54.600]  Here it is
[1:54:54.600 --> 1:54:57.600]  44,000 cases, excuse me
[1:54:57.600 --> 1:55:00.600]  I mean, this is just ridiculous
[1:55:00.600 --> 1:55:03.600]  And you know, deep seededly
[1:55:03.600 --> 1:55:05.600]  It's not even exhaustion I'm feeling
[1:55:05.600 --> 1:55:07.600]  It's anger so intense
[1:55:07.600 --> 1:55:09.600]  That it just makes me feel sick
[1:55:09.600 --> 1:55:10.600]  You know that type of anger
[1:55:10.600 --> 1:55:12.600]  That's so far down in your gut
[1:55:12.600 --> 1:55:13.600]  In the pit of your stomach
[1:55:13.600 --> 1:55:14.600]  That it's the type of anger
[1:55:14.600 --> 1:55:16.600]  Where you just would be a killing machine
[1:55:16.600 --> 1:55:18.600]  If you actually got in the fight
[1:55:18.600 --> 1:55:19.600]  That's how I feel right now
[1:55:19.600 --> 1:55:23.600]  I'm so sick of the sick freaks
[1:55:23.600 --> 1:55:24.600]  I don't know if you've joined us
[1:55:24.600 --> 1:55:25.600]  At the start of the show
[1:55:25.600 --> 1:55:26.600]  But we went into all the mainline news
[1:55:26.600 --> 1:55:29.600]  Chinese researchers being thrown out of labs
[1:55:29.600 --> 1:55:31.600]  In Canada where they had this damn thing
[1:55:31.600 --> 1:55:32.600]  Bill and Melinda Gates
[1:55:32.600 --> 1:55:35.600]  Finding a group to create it
[1:55:35.600 --> 1:55:37.600]  It's obviously been souped up
[1:55:37.600 --> 1:55:38.600]  And it's weaponized
[1:55:38.600 --> 1:55:42.600]  And they never get in trouble for it
[1:55:42.600 --> 1:55:44.600]  I mean, you know how many secret tests
[1:55:44.600 --> 1:55:46.600]  That elements of the U.S. government did
[1:55:46.600 --> 1:55:48.600]  Because it's not the whole government
[1:55:48.600 --> 1:55:50.600]  It's the scientific dictatorship
[1:55:50.600 --> 1:55:51.600]  That Eisenhower warned about
[1:55:51.600 --> 1:55:53.600]  He didn't just say the military industrial complex
[1:55:53.600 --> 1:55:57.600]  He said the scientific technological elite
[1:55:57.600 --> 1:56:01.600]  In control of the advanced research laboratories
[1:56:01.600 --> 1:56:03.600]  That then became DARPA
[1:56:03.600 --> 1:56:06.600]  Are in control of the military industrial complex
[1:56:06.600 --> 1:56:09.600]  It's not the military he said was bad
[1:56:09.600 --> 1:56:12.600]  It's the people in control of it
[1:56:12.600 --> 1:56:15.600]  At the scientific level
[1:56:15.600 --> 1:56:17.600]  Because right at that time
[1:56:17.600 --> 1:56:19.600]  They were coming to him with internet systems
[1:56:19.600 --> 1:56:21.600]  And everyone will have handheld computers
[1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:23.600]  And we'll interface with the machine
[1:56:23.600 --> 1:56:25.600]  And it'll control civilization
[1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:27.600]  And Eisenhower was like
[1:56:27.600 --> 1:56:29.600]  You're going to build a post-human world
[1:56:29.600 --> 1:56:31.600]  And they're like, sir, we have to
[1:56:31.600 --> 1:56:33.600]  Are the Russians will
[1:56:33.600 --> 1:56:34.600]  And he's like, that's ridiculous
[1:56:34.600 --> 1:56:35.600]  We'll just have moratoriums
[1:56:35.600 --> 1:56:37.600]  We're going to build a human future
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:41.600]  Eisenhower gave speeches about this
[1:56:41.600 --> 1:56:43.600]  Before he died
[1:56:43.600 --> 1:56:44.600]  Most of it was classified
[1:56:44.600 --> 1:56:45.600]  So he couldn't get into specifics
[1:56:45.600 --> 1:56:48.600]  He just said there's some crazy people
[1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:50.600]  In the advanced weapons research labs
[1:56:50.600 --> 1:56:54.600]  That have got some really dangerous ideas
[1:56:54.600 --> 1:56:57.600]  Well, folks, I think we've lived to see those ideas
[1:56:57.600 --> 1:56:59.600]  Come to fruition, haven't we?
[1:56:59.600 --> 1:57:04.600]  And now those ideas are having babies
[1:57:04.600 --> 1:57:06.600]  And it's called a post-human world
[1:57:06.600 --> 1:57:09.600]  And worshiping AI gods
[1:57:09.600 --> 1:57:11.600]  The only place I find that's the Bible
[1:57:11.600 --> 1:57:15.600]  In a book called Revelations
[1:57:15.600 --> 1:57:18.600]  So, yeah
[1:57:18.600 --> 1:57:20.600]  It's crazy town
[1:57:20.600 --> 1:57:22.600]  And China has no rules
[1:57:22.600 --> 1:57:25.600]  I mean, I remember TV pieces out of China
[1:57:25.600 --> 1:57:28.600]  20 years ago about cows that produced human milk
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:31.600]  And, you know, I remember having guests on 25 years ago
[1:57:31.600 --> 1:57:33.600]  Where they have goats that are part spider
[1:57:33.600 --> 1:57:34.600]  In the U.S.
[1:57:34.600 --> 1:57:36.600]  And people didn't believe me
[1:57:36.600 --> 1:57:37.600]  I don't blame you
[1:57:37.600 --> 1:57:38.600]  That's crazy
[1:57:38.600 --> 1:57:40.600]  That should be illegal
[1:57:40.600 --> 1:57:41.600]  You know how dangerous it is?
[1:57:41.600 --> 1:57:48.600]  Splicing all those genes?
[1:58:12.600 --> 1:58:15.600]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live
[1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:17.600]  Not just to defend against these viruses
[1:58:17.600 --> 1:58:20.600]  So, right now, we have winter sun still available
[1:58:20.600 --> 1:58:22.600]  Even though we always order only so much
[1:58:22.600 --> 1:58:24.600]  For sale during the fall, winter and spring
[1:58:24.600 --> 1:58:27.600]  I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price
[1:58:27.600 --> 1:58:30.600]  Of 40% off $23
[1:58:30.600 --> 1:58:33.600]  Despite the fact that I could sell it at full price
[1:58:33.600 --> 1:58:35.600]  Because I want you to get it
[1:58:35.600 --> 1:58:36.600]  And I want to incentivize you
[1:58:36.600 --> 1:58:38.600]  Protecting yourself and your family
[1:58:38.600 --> 1:58:41.600]  So, winter sun taken out of the tongue

[1:59:43.600 --> 2:00:05.600]  InfoWarsLife.com
[2:00:13.600 --> 2:00:23.600]  Well it sounds like the perfect script for a horror movie
[2:00:23.600 --> 2:00:26.600]  A virus with no vaccine and no cure
[2:00:26.600 --> 2:00:28.600]  Kills thousands of people
[2:00:28.600 --> 2:00:32.600]  5 billion people died in 1996 and 1997
[2:00:32.600 --> 2:00:36.600]  Almost the entire population of the world
[2:00:36.600 --> 2:00:39.600]  Only about 1% of us survived
[2:00:39.600 --> 2:00:42.600]  More reports of blue cases along the border
[2:00:42.600 --> 2:00:44.600]  But officials are saying that they aren't connected
[2:00:44.600 --> 2:00:47.600]  Surely there's very real and very convincing data
[2:00:47.600 --> 2:00:50.600]  That the planet cannot survive the excesses of the human race
[2:00:50.600 --> 2:00:52.600]  And I actually think the world will be much better
[2:00:52.600 --> 2:00:55.600]  When there's only 10 or 20% of us left
[2:00:55.600 --> 2:00:57.600]  Dr. Eric Bianca
[2:00:57.600 --> 2:00:59.600]  But most frightening was the fact
[2:00:59.600 --> 2:01:02.600]  That in a crowd of over 1,000 prominent scientists
[2:01:02.600 --> 2:01:04.600]  Local newspapers reported
[2:01:04.600 --> 2:01:07.600]  That 95% of those in attendance
[2:01:07.600 --> 2:01:11.600]  Gave Bianca sustained and standing ovations
[2:01:11.600 --> 2:01:13.600]  Every time he extolled the virtues
[2:01:13.600 --> 2:01:17.600]  Of mass culling microbes and man's destruction
[2:01:17.600 --> 2:01:20.600]  And went on to laud the virtues of Ebola
[2:01:20.600 --> 2:01:24.600]  Because it would kill 90% of the world population quickly
[2:01:24.600 --> 2:01:26.600]  The World Health Organization
[2:01:26.600 --> 2:01:28.600]  Said on Tuesday the Ebola death toll
[2:01:28.600 --> 2:01:30.600]  Jumped by almost 200 in a single day
[2:01:30.600 --> 2:01:33.600]  To at least 2,296
[2:01:33.600 --> 2:01:35.600]  And is likely to be higher than that
[2:01:35.600 --> 2:01:38.600]  The head of the US Centers for Disease Control
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:42.600]  Confirmed Tuesday that West Africa is in a desperate situation
[2:01:42.600 --> 2:01:46.600]  But that there is still hope that the outbreak can be reined in
[2:01:46.600 --> 2:01:49.600]  A top German virologist has caused shock waves
[2:01:49.600 --> 2:01:51.600]  By asserting that it's too late
[2:01:51.600 --> 2:01:54.600]  To halt the spread of the Ebola virus
[2:01:54.600 --> 2:01:57.600]  In other news, the CDC is receiving reports
[2:01:57.600 --> 2:02:00.600]  Of a possible flu outbreak in San Francisco
[2:02:00.600 --> 2:02:03.600]  If the symptoms were first detected in Philadelphia
[2:02:03.600 --> 2:02:05.600]  On December 27, 1996
[2:02:05.600 --> 2:02:07.600]  That makes us know that
[2:02:07.600 --> 2:02:11.600]  It was released in Philadelphia probably on December 13, 1996
[2:02:11.600 --> 2:02:14.600]  And was seen sequentially after that year
[2:02:14.600 --> 2:02:18.600]  San Francisco, New Orleans, Rio de Janeiro
[2:02:18.600 --> 2:02:24.600]  Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, then Peking
[2:02:24.600 --> 2:02:29.600]  Rome, Kinshasa, Karachi, Bangkok, Peking
[2:02:29.600 --> 2:02:32.600]  Some trip you're taking, sir, is this all in one week?
[2:02:32.600 --> 2:02:34.600]  Business
[2:02:34.600 --> 2:02:37.600]  One of the two Americans infected with the Ebola virus
[2:02:37.600 --> 2:02:41.600]  Has arrived in Atlanta from Africa for treatment
[2:02:41.600 --> 2:02:44.600]  The Massachusetts doctor arrived at the Nebraska Medical Center
[2:02:44.600 --> 2:02:47.600]  Just before dawn this morning to be treated for Ebola
[2:02:47.600 --> 2:02:51.600]  And right now, his or her blood sample is on its way
[2:02:51.600 --> 2:02:53.600]  To the Centers for Disease Control
[2:02:53.600 --> 2:02:55.600]  The new ability to wage war
[2:02:55.600 --> 2:02:57.600]  Is born from the blood of the victim
[2:02:57.600 --> 2:02:59.600]  There you see
[2:02:59.600 --> 2:03:02.600]  Also invisible to the naked eye
[2:03:02.600 --> 2:03:07.600]  Doesn't even have an odor
[2:03:07.600 --> 2:03:09.600]  This Ebola outbreak is unprecedented
[2:03:09.600 --> 2:03:12.600]  And has become the deadliest on record
[2:03:12.600 --> 2:03:15.600]  Ebola is now an epidemic
[2:03:15.600 --> 2:03:19.600]  You start to get a sense of the rapid escalation now
[2:03:19.600 --> 2:03:21.600]  We're seeing of the virus
[2:03:21.600 --> 2:03:25.600]  Imagine a virus, the most terrifying virus you can
[2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:28.600]  And then imagine that you and you alone have the cure
[2:03:28.600 --> 2:03:31.600]  Without specific drugs or a vaccine for Ebola
[2:03:31.600 --> 2:03:33.600]  The only thing doctors can do
[2:03:33.600 --> 2:03:35.600]  For those suffering from this disease
[2:03:35.600 --> 2:03:37.600]  Is treat their symptoms
[2:03:37.600 --> 2:03:40.600]  That's a report that we put out years ago
[2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:44.600]  And we're gonna repost it to Band-Aid Video
[2:03:44.600 --> 2:03:46.600]  In the next few minutes
[2:03:46.600 --> 2:03:48.600]  I'm gonna give it a new name
[2:03:48.600 --> 2:03:52.600]  But just look for that
[2:03:52.600 --> 2:03:54.600]  I'll make it the featured video
[2:03:54.600 --> 2:04:02.600]  Band-Aid Video
[2:04:02.600 --> 2:04:03.600]  Remember the big hubbub
[2:04:03.600 --> 2:04:05.600]  Bringing one person or two or three people in
[2:04:05.600 --> 2:04:06.600]  That had Ebola?
[2:04:06.600 --> 2:04:08.600]  Now we bring in people by the thousands from the Congo
[2:04:08.600 --> 2:04:10.600]  And they're not even screened or checked
[2:04:10.600 --> 2:04:11.600]  And they've confirmed
[2:04:11.600 --> 2:04:13.600]  And the Caribbean Ebola's been brought in
[2:04:13.600 --> 2:04:15.600]  Trying to get an epidemic going
[2:04:15.600 --> 2:04:17.600]  So they don't have to stage one
[2:04:17.600 --> 2:04:19.600]  And then the head UN scientist says
[2:04:19.600 --> 2:04:20.600]  Vaccines are killing people
[2:04:20.600 --> 2:04:22.600]  We've been covering it up
[2:04:22.600 --> 2:04:23.600]  We haven't even done any studies
[2:04:23.600 --> 2:04:25.600]  Big pharma does that secretly
[2:04:25.600 --> 2:04:29.600]  And the doctors think we're hurting people
[2:04:29.600 --> 2:04:31.600]  It's just amazing
[2:04:31.600 --> 2:04:34.600]  But this situation with coronavirus
[2:04:34.600 --> 2:04:37.600]  Evidence isn't mounting that it's man-made
[2:04:37.600 --> 2:04:41.600]  It's unbelievably obvious that it's man-made
[2:04:41.600 --> 2:04:42.600]  So we'll have more on this
[2:04:42.600 --> 2:04:43.600]  The Senate trial
[2:04:43.600 --> 2:04:46.600]  Like watching paint dry and so much more

[2:05:18.600 --> 2:05:19.600]  The New World Order is real
[2:05:19.600 --> 2:05:20.600]  Satanism is real
[2:05:20.600 --> 2:05:21.600]  The pedophile a leader real
[2:05:21.600 --> 2:05:22.600]  But we're real as well
[2:05:22.600 --> 2:05:23.600]  And we love God
[2:05:23.600 --> 2:05:25.600]  And we're standing up and saying no
[2:05:25.600 --> 2:05:27.600]  But I just want to make the point here
[2:05:27.600 --> 2:05:28.600]  One month into 2020
[2:05:28.600 --> 2:05:30.600]  That we have never been in Kansas
[2:05:30.600 --> 2:05:32.600]  We have never been in some small
[2:05:32.600 --> 2:05:33.600]  Ville place that didn't matter
[2:05:33.600 --> 2:05:35.600]  Everything we do
[2:05:35.600 --> 2:05:36.600]  Every decision we make
[2:05:36.600 --> 2:05:38.600]  Governs the future of our species
[2:05:38.600 --> 2:05:40.600]  And everything we've gone through
[2:05:40.600 --> 2:05:41.600]  And everything we're going to go through
[2:05:41.600 --> 2:05:42.600]  So it's an incredible town to be alive
[2:05:42.600 --> 2:05:43.600]  I'm going to thank you all
[2:05:43.600 --> 2:05:45.600]  For being aware and being involved
[2:05:45.600 --> 2:05:47.600]  But just remember, your action now
[2:05:47.600 --> 2:05:49.600]  Via prayer, word of mouth
[2:05:49.600 --> 2:05:50.600]  And financial support at
[2:05:50.600 --> 2:05:52.600]  Infowars.com is critical
[2:05:52.600 --> 2:05:55.600]  So please take action
[2:05:55.600 --> 2:06:11.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776
[2:06:11.600 --> 2:06:14.600]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[2:06:14.600 --> 2:06:19.600]  He wrote a blazing Santa
[2:06:19.600 --> 2:06:22.600]  He wore a shining star
[2:06:22.600 --> 2:06:25.600]  I've been looking, but I still haven't seen
[2:06:25.600 --> 2:06:28.600]  Any reportage on restrictions
[2:06:28.600 --> 2:06:30.600]  From people from China to the United States
[2:06:30.600 --> 2:06:33.600]  Other countries like South Korea
[2:06:33.600 --> 2:06:35.600]  Philippines, Mongolia
[2:06:35.600 --> 2:06:37.600]  Are absolutely closing their borders
[2:06:37.600 --> 2:06:40.600]  And saying nobody from China can come in
[2:06:40.600 --> 2:06:43.600]  That's the smart move with the university
[2:06:43.600 --> 2:06:45.600]  Of Hong Kong, highly respected
[2:06:45.600 --> 2:06:51.600]  Reporting 44,000 now infected
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:53.600]  We've posted that naturalnews.com story
[2:06:53.600 --> 2:06:55.600]  To infowars.com
[2:06:55.600 --> 2:06:57.600]  I hope you'll share it
[2:06:57.600 --> 2:06:58.600]  Nearly 44,000 people already infected
[2:06:58.600 --> 2:07:00.600]  By the Wuhan coronavirus
[2:07:00.600 --> 2:07:01.600]  Warned academic researchers
[2:07:01.600 --> 2:07:02.600]  From the University of Hong Kong
[2:07:02.600 --> 2:07:04.600]  Over the weekend
[2:07:04.600 --> 2:07:05.600]  The official number of infectious
[2:07:05.600 --> 2:07:07.600]  Claim by the communist Chinese government
[2:07:07.600 --> 2:07:09.600]  Is only 2,900
[2:07:09.600 --> 2:07:10.600]  Revealing a desperate effort
[2:07:10.600 --> 2:07:12.600]  To cover up the true numbers
[2:07:12.600 --> 2:07:14.600]  And lie to the world about
[2:07:14.600 --> 2:07:17.600]  A dangerous, deadly pandemic
[2:07:17.600 --> 2:07:18.600]  University of Hong Kong
[2:07:18.600 --> 2:07:20.600]  Academics on Monday estimated
[2:07:20.600 --> 2:07:22.600]  The number of patients in Wuhan
[2:07:22.600 --> 2:07:26.600]  Has reached 53,590 by Saturday
[2:07:26.600 --> 2:07:28.600]  Including those in the incubation
[2:07:28.600 --> 2:07:30.600]  Stage of the virus
[2:07:30.600 --> 2:07:32.600]  Which includes pneumonia
[2:07:32.600 --> 2:07:35.600]  Reports the South China Morning Post
[2:07:35.600 --> 2:07:37.600]  Lead researcher and dean
[2:07:37.600 --> 2:07:39.600]  Of HKU's facility of medicine
[2:07:39.600 --> 2:07:42.600]  Gabriel Leung said his team
[2:07:42.600 --> 2:07:46.600]  Estimated there were 25,630 patients
[2:07:46.600 --> 2:07:48.600]  Showing symptoms in Wuhan
[2:07:48.600 --> 2:07:51.600]  The number would double in 6.2 days
[2:07:51.600 --> 2:07:53.600]  According to mathematical modeling
[2:07:53.600 --> 2:07:55.600]  Based on infectious figures
[2:07:55.600 --> 2:07:58.600]  Worldwide as of Saturday
[2:07:58.600 --> 2:08:00.600]  Importantly, the Wuhan coronavirus
[2:08:00.600 --> 2:08:02.600]  Is now known to be infectious
[2:08:02.600 --> 2:08:04.600]  During its incubation period
[2:08:04.600 --> 2:08:06.600]  Which means that people are spreading
[2:08:06.600 --> 2:08:08.600]  The pandemic even before they realize
[2:08:08.600 --> 2:08:09.600]  They're sick themselves
[2:08:09.600 --> 2:08:10.600]  According to recent analysis
[2:08:10.600 --> 2:08:12.600]  Published in the Lancet family
[2:08:12.600 --> 2:08:13.600]  Members of victims exposed
[2:08:13.600 --> 2:08:15.600]  The coronavirus showed no symptoms
[2:08:15.600 --> 2:08:17.600]  For 8 days before finally being diagnosed
[2:08:17.600 --> 2:08:18.600]  With full-blown symptoms
[2:08:18.600 --> 2:08:20.600]  Some just dropped dead on the street
[2:08:20.600 --> 2:08:22.600]  Additionally, about 2% of those infected
[2:08:22.600 --> 2:08:24.600]  Showed no signs of fever
[2:08:24.600 --> 2:08:25.600]  Or respiratory distress
[2:08:25.600 --> 2:08:26.600]  Meaning they're able to pass
[2:08:26.600 --> 2:08:28.600]  Right through airport screening measures
[2:08:28.600 --> 2:08:30.600]  Here are the official Chinese government
[2:08:30.600 --> 2:08:32.600]  Numbers
[2:08:32.600 --> 2:08:34.600]  And then it goes into the equations
[2:08:34.600 --> 2:08:35.600]  And how they come up with that
[2:08:35.600 --> 2:08:37.600]  Is how many there currently are
[2:08:37.600 --> 2:08:40.600]  And it goes into the Lancet study
[2:08:40.600 --> 2:08:41.600]  And the infectious rates
[2:08:41.600 --> 2:08:44.600]  You might want to go read that story
[2:08:44.600 --> 2:08:47.600]  And then you learn
[2:08:47.600 --> 2:08:49.600]  That Bill and Melinda Gates were funding
[2:08:49.600 --> 2:08:53.600]  Taking it and patting the virus
[2:08:53.600 --> 2:08:56.600]  And you learn that some chai comms
[2:08:56.600 --> 2:08:57.600]  Got kicked out of the university
[2:08:57.600 --> 2:08:59.600]  Up in Canada
[2:08:59.600 --> 2:09:02.600]  That has level 4 facilities in it
[2:09:02.600 --> 2:09:04.600]  Believed to be spies
[2:09:04.600 --> 2:09:07.600]  Going after the coronavirus
[2:09:07.600 --> 2:09:08.600]  That was known to be held
[2:09:08.600 --> 2:09:10.600]  In that facility
[2:09:10.600 --> 2:09:11.600]  Major manufacturing hubs
[2:09:11.600 --> 2:09:13.600]  Shutting down in China
[2:09:13.600 --> 2:09:15.600]  Amid virus outbreak
[2:09:15.600 --> 2:09:17.600]  That's just some of the news
[2:09:17.600 --> 2:09:19.600]  On those fronts
[2:09:19.600 --> 2:09:21.600]  Meanwhile
[2:09:21.600 --> 2:09:26.600]  If you want to save the world
[2:09:26.600 --> 2:09:27.600]  Cut back on email
[2:09:27.600 --> 2:09:30.600]  If you want to fight global warming
[2:09:30.600 --> 2:09:33.600]  That's Bloomberg News reporting that
[2:09:33.600 --> 2:09:34.600]  That's right
[2:09:34.600 --> 2:09:35.600]  And they're saying that
[2:09:35.600 --> 2:09:37.600]  You shouldn't save all those emails
[2:09:37.600 --> 2:09:38.600]  And all those photos
[2:09:38.600 --> 2:09:40.600]  Those are bad for the earth
[2:09:40.600 --> 2:09:42.600]  So AI is going to start deciding
[2:09:42.600 --> 2:09:44.600]  Which photos you can keep
[2:09:44.600 --> 2:09:46.600]  And which emails you can
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:47.600]  See, it's reading everything
[2:09:47.600 --> 2:09:49.600]  To save the earth
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:53.600]  Monitoring everything in real time
[2:09:53.600 --> 2:09:55.600]  Prince Charles, meanwhile
[2:09:55.600 --> 2:09:57.600]  We should pull this article up
[2:09:57.600 --> 2:09:59.600]  Flu, because they have a nice graphic
[2:09:59.600 --> 2:10:01.600]  16,000 miles in just 11 days
[2:10:01.600 --> 2:10:03.600]  Before proudly posing with Greta Thunberg
[2:10:03.600 --> 2:10:06.600]  In Davos and saying how bad
[2:10:06.600 --> 2:10:09.600]  And how evil it is to have a carbon footprint
[2:10:09.600 --> 2:10:12.600]  But see, that's for you
[2:10:12.600 --> 2:10:14.600]  Not for them
[2:10:14.600 --> 2:10:17.600]  But of course, carbon dioxide
[2:10:17.600 --> 2:10:19.600]  Is a good thing
[2:10:19.600 --> 2:10:20.600]  Plants, read it
[2:10:20.600 --> 2:10:23.600]  They put out more oxygen for us
[2:10:23.600 --> 2:10:25.600]  It's called the carbon cycle
[2:10:25.600 --> 2:10:27.600]  She's not worried about genetic engineering
[2:10:27.600 --> 2:10:29.600]  And human clones and genetic superviruses
[2:10:29.600 --> 2:10:31.600]  In fact, Prince Charles' father
[2:10:31.600 --> 2:10:33.600]  Said he'd like to come back
[2:10:33.600 --> 2:10:36.600]  As a particularly deadly virus
[2:10:36.600 --> 2:10:38.600]  To wipe out humanity
[2:10:38.600 --> 2:10:40.600]  He told Reuters that
[2:10:40.600 --> 2:10:42.600]  He was asked again by an Audubon society
[2:10:42.600 --> 2:10:46.600]  Repeated the statement
[2:10:46.600 --> 2:10:51.600]  And of course, he was fighting for the Nazis
[2:10:51.600 --> 2:10:53.600]  Prince Charles' father
[2:10:53.600 --> 2:10:56.600]  But he was allowed because he was a duke
[2:10:56.600 --> 2:10:58.600]  He was allowed, but he was actually
[2:10:58.600 --> 2:11:03.600]  The prince of Cyprus
[2:11:03.600 --> 2:11:05.600]  Little king
[2:11:05.600 --> 2:11:08.600]  His dad was allowed to switch sides
[2:11:08.600 --> 2:11:10.600]  In the middle of World War II
[2:11:10.600 --> 2:11:11.600]  There's pictures of Prince Philip
[2:11:11.600 --> 2:11:14.600]  In his Nazi uniform with Hitler
[2:11:14.600 --> 2:11:16.600]  And then of course, he had his buddy
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:20.600]  The king of the Netherlands
[2:11:20.600 --> 2:11:24.600]  Prince Bernhardt
[2:11:24.600 --> 2:11:27.600]  And he fought for the Nazis too
[2:11:27.600 --> 2:11:30.600]  But he got to switch sides
[2:11:30.600 --> 2:11:31.600]  Yeah, there he is
[2:11:31.600 --> 2:11:35.600]  There's a old Prince Philip
[2:11:35.600 --> 2:11:37.600]  Marching up ahead there
[2:11:37.600 --> 2:11:38.600]  Past that's Herr Hitler
[2:11:38.600 --> 2:11:40.600]  Why don't we pull up the
[2:11:40.600 --> 2:11:42.600]  Edward VIII with Hitler
[2:11:42.600 --> 2:11:43.600]  That's always a nice photo too
[2:11:43.600 --> 2:11:48.600]  That's the king of England
[2:11:48.600 --> 2:11:50.600]  We're always told he
[2:11:50.600 --> 2:11:52.600]  Stepped down as the king of England
[2:11:52.600 --> 2:11:54.600]  Because he married a woman from America
[2:11:54.600 --> 2:11:55.600]  Yeah, right
[2:11:55.600 --> 2:11:57.600]  The king could do whatever he wanted
[2:11:57.600 --> 2:12:00.600]  It was because Hitler was starting
[2:12:00.600 --> 2:12:03.600]  To lose World War II
[2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:07.600]  He had a plan
[2:12:07.600 --> 2:12:09.600]  Now there you go
[2:12:09.600 --> 2:12:12.600]  That's the king of England
[2:12:12.600 --> 2:12:14.600]  Right there to the left
[2:12:14.600 --> 2:12:15.600]  Had a deal with Hitler
[2:12:15.600 --> 2:12:17.600]  Told him to launch the attack
[2:12:17.600 --> 2:12:20.600]  They were going to set up a 10-country thing
[2:12:20.600 --> 2:12:22.600]  Called the European Union
[2:12:22.600 --> 2:12:25.600]  Hitler even designed the blue flag with gold stars
[2:12:25.600 --> 2:12:30.600]  Hitler also designed the symbol of the Olympics
[2:12:30.600 --> 2:12:32.600]  And he also designed the Volkswagen's body
[2:12:32.600 --> 2:12:35.600]  He also designed the Autobahn
[2:12:35.600 --> 2:12:38.600]  He also designed German submarines
[2:12:38.600 --> 2:12:39.600]  He also...
[2:12:39.600 --> 2:12:41.600]  Yeah, he would give the basic design
[2:12:41.600 --> 2:12:42.600]  He wanted the shape
[2:12:42.600 --> 2:12:43.600]  He would have to comport to him
[2:12:43.600 --> 2:12:44.600]  The Volkswagen
[2:12:44.600 --> 2:12:45.600]  Nothing against the car
[2:12:45.600 --> 2:12:48.600]  The classic bug, Hitler drew that
[2:12:48.600 --> 2:12:50.600]  And gave it to Albert Speer
[2:12:50.600 --> 2:12:54.600]  The Ministry of the Interior had to do that
[2:12:54.600 --> 2:12:56.600]  But meanwhile, let's punch up Fox News right now
[2:12:56.600 --> 2:12:57.600]  If you can
[2:12:57.600 --> 2:13:00.600]  There's Addald Nadler
[2:13:00.600 --> 2:13:02.600]  Being handed their impeachment pins
[2:13:02.600 --> 2:13:04.600]  At the signing ceremony
[2:13:04.600 --> 2:13:05.600]  For the impeachment
[2:13:05.600 --> 2:13:07.600]  Though she said it was a solemn, horrible thing
[2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:08.600]  But she acted like...
[2:13:08.600 --> 2:13:12.600]  I mean, look at these losers
[2:13:12.600 --> 2:13:13.600]  Unbelievable
[2:13:13.600 --> 2:13:16.600]  And now we've gone back to Jay Sekulow
[2:13:16.600 --> 2:13:17.600]  Which is interesting
[2:13:17.600 --> 2:13:19.600]  When he talks, usually has something good to say
[2:13:19.600 --> 2:13:21.600]  Doesn't make me want to jump off a cliff
[2:13:21.600 --> 2:13:23.600]  Like Ken Starr
[2:13:23.600 --> 2:13:24.600]  Let's see what Sekulow is talking about
[2:13:24.600 --> 2:13:28.600]  My colleague, the Deputy White House Counsel, Mike Papura
[2:13:28.600 --> 2:13:30.600]  Will be joining us in a moment
[2:13:30.600 --> 2:13:33.600]  To discuss more of the facts
[2:13:33.600 --> 2:13:37.600]  To continue the discussion that we had on Saturday
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:40.600]  But let me just recap very quickly
[2:13:40.600 --> 2:13:43.600]  What was laid out on Saturday
[2:13:43.600 --> 2:13:46.600]  First, the transcript shows
[2:13:46.600 --> 2:13:50.600]  The President did not condition either security assistance
[2:13:50.600 --> 2:13:53.600]  Or a meeting on anything
[2:13:53.600 --> 2:13:55.600]  The Paul security assistance funds
[2:13:55.600 --> 2:13:59.600]  Aren't even mentioned on the call
[2:13:59.600 --> 2:14:03.600]  Second, President Zelensky
[2:14:03.600 --> 2:14:05.600]  And the other Ukrainian officials
[2:14:05.600 --> 2:14:08.600]  Repeatedly said there was no quid pro quo
[2:14:08.600 --> 2:14:09.600]  Alright, let's stop again
[2:14:09.600 --> 2:14:12.600]  This is like a nightmare, groundhog day
[2:14:12.600 --> 2:14:14.600]  We know this
[2:14:14.600 --> 2:14:16.600]  And I understand they're putting on their defense
[2:14:16.600 --> 2:14:19.600]  But you know the Democrats are winning
[2:14:19.600 --> 2:14:22.600]  No, they're not going to win getting Trump out this time
[2:14:22.600 --> 2:14:24.600]  But sucking all the air out of the room
[2:14:24.600 --> 2:14:26.600]  Making us talk about this all day
[2:14:26.600 --> 2:14:29.600]  And crippling the President
[2:14:29.600 --> 2:14:32.600]  Like, oh, the President can't talk about corruption
[2:14:32.600 --> 2:14:36.600]  The highest crime in America is saying that
[2:14:36.600 --> 2:14:38.600]  Women only have babies
[2:14:38.600 --> 2:14:40.600]  And the other highest crime is saying that
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:42.600]  The President can go after corruption
[2:14:42.600 --> 2:14:46.600]  I mean, the things the left gets us to do
[2:14:46.600 --> 2:14:50.600]  And how they tell us all this crap
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:53.600]  And then because they say something's illegal
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:54.600]  It's supposedly illegal
[2:14:54.600 --> 2:14:58.600]  What a load of horse pucky
[2:14:58.600 --> 2:15:01.600]  Let me get the number out to talk about China crisis
[2:15:01.600 --> 2:15:02.600]  What do you think it is?
[2:15:02.600 --> 2:15:04.600]  Bioweapon? How bad is it going to get?
[2:15:04.600 --> 2:15:06.600]  What are you doing to prepare for it?
[2:15:06.600 --> 2:15:09.600]  Who should be held accountable for cooking up these viruses?
[2:15:09.600 --> 2:15:11.600]  The whole trail going back to Bill and Melinda Gates
[2:15:11.600 --> 2:15:13.600]  And I mean, it's all there
[2:15:13.600 --> 2:15:15.600]  What is your gut? What is your brain?
[2:15:15.600 --> 2:15:17.600]  What does your spirit tell you?
[2:15:17.600 --> 2:15:22.600]  877-789 Alex? 877-789-2539
[2:15:22.600 --> 2:15:23.600]  Wide open phones
[2:15:23.600 --> 2:15:27.600]  877-789 Alex
[2:15:27.600 --> 2:15:30.600]  But we're specifically talking about the virus
[2:15:30.600 --> 2:15:31.600]  I really want to pick your brain
[2:15:31.600 --> 2:15:32.600]  I respect your views

[2:15:35.600 --> 2:15:36.600]  We have a guest popping in
[2:15:36.600 --> 2:15:38.600]  She's running against Nancy Pelosi
[2:15:38.600 --> 2:15:39.600]  And then after she pops in
[2:15:39.600 --> 2:15:41.600]  We're going to take your phone calls a little bit

[2:15:44.600 --> 2:15:45.600]  I feel like I should be at home
[2:15:45.600 --> 2:15:46.600]  Getting ready for this virus

[2:18:54.180 --> 2:18:58.460]  I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from InfoWars.
[2:18:58.460 --> 2:19:04.180]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[2:19:04.180 --> 2:19:09.220]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide, and
[2:19:09.220 --> 2:19:14.740]  President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is
[2:19:14.740 --> 2:19:15.740]  amazing as well.
[2:19:15.740 --> 2:19:21.380]  He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against that in some other areas,
[2:19:21.380 --> 2:19:26.220]  but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out against communist China, Trump's
[2:19:26.220 --> 2:19:31.660]  been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we really have to realize that we're
[2:19:31.660 --> 2:19:36.860]  being targeted because we are effective, and the globalists are beginning to lose their
[2:19:36.860 --> 2:19:39.780]  war against humanity in a big way.
[2:19:39.780 --> 2:19:43.620]  And so we're going to see some major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let
[2:19:43.620 --> 2:19:48.060]  ourselves get down when we see all the poison they spray at us.
[2:19:48.060 --> 2:19:49.980]  That's an attempt to demoralize us.
[2:19:49.980 --> 2:19:57.980]  We've got to remember that and stay focused and stay happy.
[2:19:57.980 --> 2:20:04.980]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:20:27.980 --> 2:20:32.860]  Alright, she's with us for a couple segments, then I'm going to open the phones up and take
[2:20:32.860 --> 2:20:40.700]  your calls on what you think about the situation with this already out of control virus, and
[2:20:40.700 --> 2:20:44.380]  the communist Chinese trying to cover up just how bad it is.
[2:20:44.380 --> 2:20:49.780]  We now have the article out of the South Hong Kong Post with their major university saying
[2:20:49.780 --> 2:20:55.340]  they estimate 44,000 cases of it conservatively way higher than what the Chinese communist
[2:20:55.340 --> 2:20:57.700]  government is saying.
[2:20:57.700 --> 2:21:03.300]  Deanna Lorraine obviously is not a stranger to folks that are aware of who the patriots
[2:21:03.300 --> 2:21:04.300]  are out there.
[2:21:04.300 --> 2:21:07.260]  She's been on, you name it, Fox CNN News, Max de Blay.
[2:21:07.260 --> 2:21:11.140]  She's been on M4s with Owen Schreuer and his show.
[2:21:11.140 --> 2:21:16.020]  And when Tom Papert was filling in, so I really appreciate her coming on for her views on
[2:21:16.020 --> 2:21:21.940]  what's happening with the trial in the Senate, the election coming up with only 280 days,
[2:21:21.940 --> 2:21:26.940]  and her running for Congress against the Crip Keeper herself, Nancy Pelosi.
[2:21:26.940 --> 2:21:32.900]  So deanna4congress.com, again, I'm not going to go over her entire background, but she's
[2:21:32.900 --> 2:21:35.340]  running in California's 12th district.
[2:21:35.340 --> 2:21:39.900]  She invites anyone to join her in the fight of the millennium to take our country back.
[2:21:39.900 --> 2:21:41.460]  So very, very exciting.
[2:21:41.460 --> 2:21:42.460]  Thank you for joining us.
[2:21:42.460 --> 2:21:43.460]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:21:43.460 --> 2:21:46.060]  It's so great to be here.
[2:21:46.060 --> 2:21:51.060]  Where do you want to start with what Pelosi is leading right now in the Congress or your
[2:21:51.060 --> 2:21:54.980]  campaign or what's happening with this virus?
[2:21:54.980 --> 2:21:55.980]  Where do you want to start?
[2:21:55.980 --> 2:21:59.900]  I mean, Nancy Pelosi, she is the Wicked Witch of the West herself.
[2:21:59.900 --> 2:22:02.660]  I mean, she is like Satan incarnate.
[2:22:02.660 --> 2:22:08.180]  She's leading us down a terrible path of destruction in America, and it's insane to me that she
[2:22:08.180 --> 2:22:13.700]  would have any support and any voters whatsoever, especially in San Francisco, which is the district
[2:22:13.700 --> 2:22:16.740]  that she's most destroying.
[2:22:16.740 --> 2:22:20.740]  Let's talk about San Francisco and why you decided to run and really how bad it is.
[2:22:20.740 --> 2:22:24.220]  Because I don't think people realize until you go to Portland or you go to San Francisco
[2:22:24.220 --> 2:22:28.460]  or you go to LA or now much of Austin, I mean, these used to be nice places.
[2:22:28.460 --> 2:22:32.580]  They are SH-T holes in many areas.
[2:22:32.580 --> 2:22:33.580]  Absolutely.
[2:22:33.580 --> 2:22:35.900]  You know, it used to be charming.
[2:22:35.900 --> 2:22:36.900]  You'd go there.
[2:22:36.900 --> 2:22:41.380]  You'd have some clam chowder or a fisherman's work or something ride the trolley car.
[2:22:41.380 --> 2:22:45.740]  Now you're riding the trolley car to a SH-I-T hole.
[2:22:45.740 --> 2:22:46.740]  It's so bad.
[2:22:46.740 --> 2:22:52.860]  I mean, there's so many areas that are just littered in trash and needles and feces.
[2:22:52.860 --> 2:22:56.020]  The number one thing that you find over there is hypergermic needles.
[2:22:56.020 --> 2:22:58.260]  They're everywhere and there's feces everywhere.
[2:22:58.260 --> 2:23:02.500]  The poop map is absolutely real and the homeless people.
[2:23:02.500 --> 2:23:06.300]  There is just so many homeless people and you literally don't know if certain people
[2:23:06.300 --> 2:23:08.240]  are dead or alive.
[2:23:08.240 --> 2:23:09.580]  People have to step over them.
[2:23:09.580 --> 2:23:12.980]  They're right in the middle of your walkway as you're walking to Starbucks.
[2:23:12.980 --> 2:23:15.700]  I mean, people are suffering.
[2:23:15.700 --> 2:23:16.700]  Veterans are suffering.
[2:23:16.700 --> 2:23:22.020]  And it makes me so outraged again that these people, these veterans, these Americans that
[2:23:22.020 --> 2:23:27.020]  are our brothers and sisters are suffering on the streets and Nancy Pelosi is focused
[2:23:27.020 --> 2:23:30.340]  all her attention on impeaching the president.
[2:23:30.340 --> 2:23:35.220]  She's focused all her attention on these asinine issues, not only on impeaching the president,
[2:23:35.220 --> 2:23:40.500]  but other issues like what gender pronoun that we should be using or giving free health
[2:23:40.500 --> 2:23:42.780]  care to illegal immigrants.
[2:23:42.780 --> 2:23:43.780]  What about Americans?
[2:23:43.780 --> 2:23:44.980]  What about our suffering?
[2:23:44.980 --> 2:23:46.660]  What about our well-being and prosperity?
[2:23:46.660 --> 2:23:50.500]  Nope, she doesn't care.
[2:23:50.500 --> 2:23:51.940]  What is the method?
[2:23:51.940 --> 2:23:54.060]  Is there any method to the madness?
[2:23:54.060 --> 2:23:59.540]  No, there's absolutely no method to the madness except for this is intentional.
[2:23:59.540 --> 2:24:03.620]  President Trump always calls her and the Democrats the do nothing Democrats.
[2:24:03.620 --> 2:24:06.100]  That's one area that I disagree on with President Trump.
[2:24:06.100 --> 2:24:07.820]  They're not do nothing Democrats.
[2:24:07.820 --> 2:24:09.740]  They're do destruction Democrats.
[2:24:09.740 --> 2:24:17.060]  There's a plan in place and it is to destroy America from within, not only from the outside,
[2:24:17.060 --> 2:24:22.580]  right politically and with legislation, but culturally they're destroying our culture
[2:24:22.580 --> 2:24:27.820]  so that we will be a culture basically that we're dependent on the government.
[2:24:27.820 --> 2:24:32.620]  We're no longer dependent on our families or our relationships because the relationships
[2:24:32.620 --> 2:24:34.180]  and families are broken.
[2:24:34.180 --> 2:24:38.100]  The left and their policies are ensuring that they're broken.
[2:24:38.100 --> 2:24:43.700]  We're no longer relying on our country, our patriotism, our pride in this country on the
[2:24:43.700 --> 2:24:49.220]  American values that made our country so great like personal empowerment, personal responsibility.
[2:24:49.220 --> 2:24:55.140]  No, it's to create disorder and chaos so that we will then rely on the government and be
[2:24:55.140 --> 2:24:56.140]  a country of socialism.
[2:24:56.140 --> 2:24:59.140]  And I'm just not going to stand for it, not under my watch.
[2:24:59.140 --> 2:25:04.140]  And I don't know how anyone could, you know, this is why I'm so passionate, why I threw
[2:25:04.140 --> 2:25:09.980]  myself in the fire to run against Nancy because how could you not every word out of her mouth
[2:25:09.980 --> 2:25:16.660]  is a lie, how could you watch her and see her betrayal to the American people, her betrayal
[2:25:16.660 --> 2:25:21.340]  and utter crapping on the Constitution and not just want to kick her ass.
[2:25:21.340 --> 2:25:25.220]  I'm not going to do that physically, but I'm going to do that in this battle.
[2:25:25.220 --> 2:25:28.100]  I threw myself in the fire because I have to fight.
[2:25:28.100 --> 2:25:29.260]  We have to fight.
[2:25:29.260 --> 2:25:34.740]  We cannot just wave the white flag as a surrender as conservatives, we have to show the country
[2:25:34.740 --> 2:25:39.380]  that we're here and we're going to fight these people, these political monsters.
[2:25:39.380 --> 2:25:43.740]  Deanna Lorraine, I know this, we need you in Congress bad and you're taking on the biggest
[2:25:43.740 --> 2:25:49.220]  head of the Hydra yourself right now and I want to talk about that.
[2:25:49.220 --> 2:25:52.140]  She certainly is, but let's go back to what you just brought up.
[2:25:52.140 --> 2:25:55.460]  I harp on this, but I should go back and do a bigger report on it.
[2:25:55.460 --> 2:25:59.660]  They successfully changed the subject from what's in the WikiLeaks to the fact that,
[2:25:59.660 --> 2:26:01.980]  oh my gosh, somebody got them and leaked them.
[2:26:01.980 --> 2:26:07.580]  Hillary is in there talking to major university heads about psychological warfare and demoralizing
[2:26:07.580 --> 2:26:10.980]  America when creating racial division.
[2:26:10.980 --> 2:26:14.220]  That is so criminal, that is so evil and that's what they're doing.
[2:26:14.220 --> 2:26:19.540]  And the only way you can conquer a population is either to sell them to adopt what you're
[2:26:19.540 --> 2:26:23.540]  doing, which the global's haven't done, or break their will.
[2:26:23.540 --> 2:26:27.020]  And if you look at everything the Democrats in Hollywood are doing, it is to make us hate
[2:26:27.020 --> 2:26:28.780]  ourselves and break our will.
[2:26:28.780 --> 2:26:33.700]  And it's causing epic levels of suicide, depression, you name it, but other people, it's not breaking
[2:26:33.700 --> 2:26:34.700]  their will.
[2:26:34.700 --> 2:26:40.100]  It's causing people like you to emerge, and that historically happens, who wouldn't have
[2:26:40.100 --> 2:26:47.260]  run for office unless they saw the true assault, a true statement, a true person taking action,
[2:26:47.260 --> 2:26:49.500]  not for power, but because it's the right thing to do.
[2:26:49.500 --> 2:26:52.260]  I think they're summoning people like you.
[2:26:52.260 --> 2:26:54.260]  Oh, 100%.
[2:26:54.260 --> 2:26:56.420]  I never dreamed that I would be a politician.
[2:26:56.420 --> 2:27:00.140]  You know, if you were to ask me where, would you imagine doing this two years ago?
[2:27:00.140 --> 2:27:01.140]  Hell, no.
[2:27:01.140 --> 2:27:04.860]  I'm not someone who ever dreamed of being a congresswoman or anything like that.
[2:27:04.860 --> 2:27:10.300]  I'm just an ordinary American, but I'm deeply concerned and passionate about America, about
[2:27:10.300 --> 2:27:14.420]  my country I grew up in, and I cannot stand the direction that it's going under Democrat
[2:27:14.420 --> 2:27:15.420]  leadership.
[2:27:15.420 --> 2:27:16.420]  I wrote a book.
[2:27:16.420 --> 2:27:19.820]  It's caused me two years ago to write a book called Making Love Great Again.
[2:27:19.820 --> 2:27:23.900]  And the book is all about the rabbit hole, taking people down the rabbit hole and red-pilling
[2:27:23.900 --> 2:27:30.380]  them to wake up to the lies of destructive feminism, destructive progressivism, and how
[2:27:30.380 --> 2:27:36.340]  it sneaked into our culture, the entire plan, how intentional it was to break down our American
[2:27:36.340 --> 2:27:42.380]  values, to break down the family unit, to create fatherless homes, to create disorder
[2:27:42.380 --> 2:27:48.780]  out of law and order, and to have a generation of people who are moral, who succumb to moral
[2:27:48.780 --> 2:27:52.300]  relativity instead of a shared sense of morality.
[2:27:52.300 --> 2:27:55.420]  And look where we are today, right, divorces rampant.
[2:27:55.420 --> 2:28:00.500]  We have fatherless homes that is the number one cause of things like mass shootings and
[2:28:00.500 --> 2:28:03.420]  homelessness, and crime, and drugs, and mental illness.
[2:28:03.420 --> 2:28:07.020]  Men and women aren't even marrying anymore, or procreating anymore.
[2:28:07.020 --> 2:28:12.700]  Christianity is basically a dirty word now, and it's disappeared from our conversations
[2:28:12.700 --> 2:28:16.700]  and our culture, and we are at a crossroads right now.
[2:28:16.700 --> 2:28:18.340]  Do we want to keep going down this road?
[2:28:18.340 --> 2:28:23.980]  We can clearly see the impacts of how leftism has destroyed our country, our culture, our
[2:28:23.980 --> 2:28:28.020]  relationships, our families, and what are we going to do about it?
[2:28:28.020 --> 2:28:34.300]  It's ridiculous, and it's actually immoral to not talk about it, to deny the impact that
[2:28:34.300 --> 2:28:36.700]  leftist ideals and values have had on our culture.
[2:28:36.700 --> 2:28:39.980]  That's why I wrote the book, and that's what I'm going on.
[2:28:39.980 --> 2:28:46.500]  Dianne Lorraine is on fire, super smart, super smart, when we come back, I'm going to get
[2:28:46.500 --> 2:28:51.100]  her crystal ball view on what's about to happen in this election, and so much more.
[2:28:51.100 --> 2:28:53.780]  Stay with us.
[2:28:53.780 --> 2:28:58.340]  If you're trying to quit drinking, or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[2:28:58.340 --> 2:29:00.260]  You don't know me, and we'll never meet.
[2:29:00.260 --> 2:29:02.020]  I had a problem like you once.
[2:29:02.020 --> 2:29:07.420]  I drank and used to party a little too much, till it got out of control, and almost ruined
[2:29:07.420 --> 2:29:08.540]  my life.
[2:29:08.540 --> 2:29:13.780]  I realized I needed help to fix my problem, before it totally destroyed me.
[2:29:13.780 --> 2:29:18.980]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug problem, and you know you can't do it alone,
[2:29:18.980 --> 2:29:22.140]  you need to call the National Treatment Advisors.
[2:29:22.140 --> 2:29:27.020]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day program to replace your old habits with new habits,
[2:29:27.020 --> 2:29:29.100]  and totally change your life.
[2:29:29.100 --> 2:29:34.340]  And if you have PPO, private health insurance, the entire program may be covered.
[2:29:34.340 --> 2:29:37.620]  Fix your problem right now, before it gets any worse.
[2:29:37.620 --> 2:29:38.620]  Get clean.
[2:29:38.620 --> 2:29:40.620]  Call now and learn more.
[2:29:40.620 --> 2:29:48.540]  800-506-6740-800-506-6740.
[2:29:48.540 --> 2:29:59.460]  This should really be easier than it is.
[2:29:59.460 --> 2:30:01.580]  I'm not here giving you a sales pitch.
[2:30:01.580 --> 2:30:04.300]  I'm pointing out the way forward.
[2:30:04.300 --> 2:30:09.780]  Things that I've discovered, that I absolutely know work, that if you listen to me, and try
[2:30:09.780 --> 2:30:13.260]  them out for yourself, you will see how amazing it is.
[2:30:13.260 --> 2:30:19.700]  And then, your support of the product we're selling will help you, and will help us, and
[2:30:19.700 --> 2:30:20.860]  it's symbiotic.
[2:30:20.860 --> 2:30:26.300]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine, because it's the good halogen, fluoride's
[2:30:26.300 --> 2:30:27.620]  the bad halogen.
[2:30:27.620 --> 2:30:32.020]  And people told me about it for years, and I didn't listen, and I'm so thankful that
[2:30:32.020 --> 2:30:38.420]  finally I listened to Dr. Grip, like eight years ago, and started taking true iodine,
[2:30:38.420 --> 2:30:39.780]  atomic iodine.
[2:30:39.780 --> 2:30:45.460]  We've got it back in StockX2, 40% off right now, at infowarstore.com, and I'm telling
[2:30:45.460 --> 2:30:47.420]  you folks, get it.
[2:30:47.420 --> 2:30:48.940]  It's amazing.
[2:30:48.940 --> 2:30:52.140]  Discover the benefits, and it funds the InfoWare, a 360 win.
[2:30:52.140 --> 2:30:55.020]  You can't lose unless you don't take action.
[2:30:55.020 --> 2:31:00.300]  InfoWare's life is bringing you a breakthrough in modern medicine, introducing pollen block.
[2:31:00.300 --> 2:31:05.620]  We have found an extraordinary new, natural way to alleviate seasonal distress symptoms,
[2:31:05.620 --> 2:31:12.340]  including promoting clear nasal and sinus passageways, eye comfort, and respiratory function.
[2:31:12.340 --> 2:31:18.220]  In the 1960s, researchers in France noticed that people who ate certain quail eggs experienced
[2:31:18.220 --> 2:31:21.540]  less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses.
[2:31:21.540 --> 2:31:26.180]  They began studying this effect in published trials, and decades later, we now have the
[2:31:26.180 --> 2:31:31.500]  fruit of this research, a fast-acting, chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress
[2:31:31.500 --> 2:31:32.500]  symptoms.
[2:31:32.500 --> 2:31:36.380]  If pollen block is natural and effective, it is not an antihistamine.
[2:31:36.380 --> 2:31:41.100]  In fact, current research has found that it actually acts by blocking the activity of
[2:31:41.100 --> 2:31:46.900]  tryptase, which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory responses in the body.
[2:31:46.900 --> 2:31:49.620]  Go outside and enjoy the air you breathe.
[2:31:49.620 --> 2:31:54.660]  Head to infowarslife.com and grab a pack of our pollen block chewable tablets.
[2:31:54.660 --> 2:31:58.860]  I want to talk about super silver whitening toothpaste, because I hadn't tried it except
[2:31:58.860 --> 2:32:03.420]  for maybe the last week and a half, and I told Alex, I said, man, this is the best toothpaste
[2:32:03.420 --> 2:32:04.420]  I've ever tried.
[2:32:04.420 --> 2:32:06.460]  He's like, well, what are you doing just sitting in here telling me?
[2:32:06.460 --> 2:32:08.260]  You got to get up there and tell people.
[2:32:08.260 --> 2:32:14.420]  So here I am telling people, super silver whitening toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste
[2:32:14.420 --> 2:32:19.140]  I've ever tried, and I'm 45 years old, and I've tried a lot of different toothpaste.
[2:32:19.140 --> 2:32:20.620]  And it's fluoride-free.
[2:32:20.620 --> 2:32:24.820]  I think the big difference, the game changer in this is the coral calcium, because after
[2:32:24.820 --> 2:32:29.420]  I brush my teeth with this, they feel so clean, and the toothpaste that I don't even like
[2:32:29.420 --> 2:32:33.580]  rinse out my mouth after I brush my teeth with this, it feels so good.
[2:32:33.580 --> 2:32:37.740]  It feels like good things are happening in my mouth.
[2:32:37.740 --> 2:32:42.980]  In fact, I find myself brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice
[2:32:42.980 --> 2:32:57.540]  a day now, because I like the way it feels.
[2:32:57.540 --> 2:33:26.020]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:26.020 --> 2:33:34.500]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:33:34.500 --> 2:33:37.100]  The Anne Lorraine is our guest for the segment.
[2:33:37.100 --> 2:33:40.500]  Then I'm going to host a little bit of the next hour, taking your calls on the out of
[2:33:40.500 --> 2:33:47.740]  control coronavirus being reported by major publications, 44,000, not what the Chinese
[2:33:47.740 --> 2:33:54.420]  government's saying around 3,000, a very high fatality rate, and looks like it was probably
[2:33:54.420 --> 2:33:55.420]  man-made.
[2:33:55.420 --> 2:33:57.820]  We'll be covering that more after she leaves us.
[2:33:57.820 --> 2:34:04.340]  She's running against Nancy Pelosi, one of the major kingpins, if not the major kingpin,
[2:34:04.340 --> 2:34:10.580]  who is allowing California to collapse into hellish squalor while they point their finger
[2:34:10.580 --> 2:34:14.060]  at us, telling us what we need to do.
[2:34:14.060 --> 2:34:15.060]  Just amazing.
[2:34:15.060 --> 2:34:20.180]  A, I want to promote your campaign, and I think you've got a shot at winning, but regardless
[2:34:20.180 --> 2:34:23.860]  you're going to be able to be in the debates with her, you're going to be able to confront
[2:34:23.860 --> 2:34:24.860]  her.
[2:34:24.860 --> 2:34:26.140]  I mean, I think she's really, really weak.
[2:34:26.140 --> 2:34:30.460]  I mean, if I think the evidence is mounting that election fraud is the reason the Democrats
[2:34:30.460 --> 2:34:35.140]  are able to take control of California, and I think the backlash I'm seeing around the
[2:34:35.140 --> 2:34:40.380]  country is going to end up being even bigger in areas like California.
[2:34:40.380 --> 2:34:41.980]  What are you seeing on the ground?
[2:34:41.980 --> 2:34:45.220]  Well, on the ground, I'm seeing two things.
[2:34:45.220 --> 2:34:50.260]  I'm seeing, you know, people that think that she's just awesome, that she's their hero
[2:34:50.260 --> 2:34:55.540]  for going after President Trump, and there's sadly a lot of people in San Francisco and
[2:34:55.540 --> 2:34:58.540]  in liberal communist California that think that way.
[2:34:58.540 --> 2:35:03.420]  They're so indoctrinated, they're so brainwashed, and they just believe everything the news tells
[2:35:03.420 --> 2:35:04.420]  them.
[2:35:04.420 --> 2:35:07.820]  So there absolutely is that category of people in San Francisco and in California, and that's
[2:35:07.820 --> 2:35:08.820]  unfortunate.
[2:35:08.820 --> 2:35:11.660]  There's also massive voter fraud here in California.
[2:35:11.660 --> 2:35:14.140]  But then there's a lot of more moderate Democrats.
[2:35:14.140 --> 2:35:19.100]  There's a lot of no-party preference individuals, independents, and of course the Republicans
[2:35:19.100 --> 2:35:26.700]  that are just so darn sick of seeing her, so sick of this ask backwards priorities that
[2:35:26.700 --> 2:35:27.700]  she has.
[2:35:27.700 --> 2:35:32.220]  You know, with the president while California is just decaying away, that they say, you
[2:35:32.220 --> 2:35:33.220]  know what?
[2:35:33.220 --> 2:35:34.220]  We need someone new.
[2:35:34.220 --> 2:35:37.340]  A, we need someone younger who isn't senile.
[2:35:37.340 --> 2:35:42.260]  And number two, we need someone who can actually work for the American people.
[2:35:42.260 --> 2:35:45.300]  And they are feeling like I'm a breath of fresh air in that way.
[2:35:45.300 --> 2:35:46.300]  So there's hope there.
[2:35:46.300 --> 2:35:47.380]  There's absolutely hope there.
[2:35:47.380 --> 2:35:51.660]  We just need to win over the more moderates, the ones that I call them, the souls that
[2:35:51.660 --> 2:35:52.660]  are savable.
[2:35:52.660 --> 2:35:56.140]  The souls that are savable, I'm reaching, and I'm getting to, and they're excited.
[2:35:56.140 --> 2:36:00.420]  Well, the Republicans need to get behind you big time because, I mean, you're really well
[2:36:00.420 --> 2:36:03.380]  spoken, got great things you're saying.
[2:36:03.380 --> 2:36:06.180]  How much support have you seen from the Republican establishment, or have they just given up
[2:36:06.180 --> 2:36:07.180]  on California?
[2:36:07.180 --> 2:36:12.300]  It's almost laughable, it's sad, but there is, the Rhinos are real.
[2:36:12.300 --> 2:36:17.020]  I mean, they are so real, and sadly, the establishment Rhino Republicans, they have
[2:36:17.020 --> 2:36:19.780]  been threatened by me, actually.
[2:36:19.780 --> 2:36:25.740]  They don't really want me, they haven't supported me, and they see me as an outsider, I'm not
[2:36:25.740 --> 2:36:26.740]  part of the club.
[2:36:26.740 --> 2:36:30.580]  Well, I'm a real patriot, actually, I'm an ordinary American, I'm trying to do something
[2:36:30.580 --> 2:36:35.100]  bold to save America, but no, they want people that are in that establishment club.
[2:36:35.100 --> 2:36:39.780]  So it's really the real conservatives, those that are outspoken about supporting Trump,
[2:36:39.780 --> 2:36:43.220]  those are the ones that are behind me.
[2:36:43.220 --> 2:36:44.740]  How do we get you elected?
[2:36:44.740 --> 2:36:51.500]  By the way, and you can follow me on Twitter, by the way, dianna4congress, there's a lot
[2:36:51.500 --> 2:36:56.140]  of action on Twitter, I post and tweet a lot, do you want to follow my campaign there?
[2:36:56.140 --> 2:37:01.460]  Go to my website at diannaforcongress.com, and you can donate there, you can help me,
[2:37:01.460 --> 2:37:02.940]  you can participate in my campaign.
[2:37:02.940 --> 2:37:08.220]  I definitely need a lot of funds to go up against this political goliath, for sure,
[2:37:08.220 --> 2:37:12.780]  and that helps a lot with ads, with attack ads, billboards in San Francisco, wouldn't
[2:37:12.780 --> 2:37:15.420]  you like to see a big billboard attacking Nancy?
[2:37:15.420 --> 2:37:18.820]  There's a lot we can do, but it definitely requires funds, and it definitely requires
[2:37:18.820 --> 2:37:23.460]  support, and as much media as possible to get my name out and to get the word out.
[2:37:23.460 --> 2:37:24.460]  Yeah, that's what it takes.
[2:37:24.460 --> 2:37:25.460]  And we can do this.
[2:37:25.460 --> 2:37:30.180]  What it takes is action, just like we saw in Virginia, people, when they get excited,
[2:37:30.180 --> 2:37:32.300]  they can change the world.
[2:37:32.300 --> 2:37:38.940]  People need to get excited again out in California, but regardless, just running if you're well-spoken,
[2:37:38.940 --> 2:37:44.980]  like you are, just as the equivalent of tens of millions of dollars of free publicity to
[2:37:44.980 --> 2:37:48.980]  counter their lies, and if California doesn't start fighting back, it's never going to
[2:37:48.980 --> 2:37:53.500]  be able to regain the state, but you can do it, and we can keep states like Texas and
[2:37:53.500 --> 2:37:59.820]  Virginia from going blue or staying blue, but we just have to find that fighting spirit.
[2:37:59.820 --> 2:38:01.460]  Well, we have to fight.
[2:38:01.460 --> 2:38:03.820]  I mean, that's America, right?
[2:38:03.820 --> 2:38:07.620]  America was built on that fighting spirit, and I feel like we've been too passive, we've
[2:38:07.620 --> 2:38:14.340]  just been laying over and letting America become socialist one city, one state at a
[2:38:14.340 --> 2:38:15.340]  time.
[2:38:15.340 --> 2:38:16.340]  And that's not going to happen.
[2:38:16.340 --> 2:38:20.540]  I mean, one of the guys that is running up against me is a far, far left socialist.
[2:38:20.540 --> 2:38:22.860]  The AOC basically duplicate.
[2:38:22.860 --> 2:38:23.860]  And that's scary.
[2:38:23.860 --> 2:38:28.620]  It could be either me or this guy who doesn't think that Nancy is far left enough.
[2:38:28.620 --> 2:38:31.820]  Those are the kinds of people that are running right now, and you don't want to look back
[2:38:31.820 --> 2:38:35.300]  in three years from now and say, man, I wish I ran.
[2:38:35.300 --> 2:38:39.220]  I wish that I supported someone that was a true patriot that was running.
[2:38:39.220 --> 2:38:40.460]  We can save ourselves.
[2:38:40.460 --> 2:38:43.180]  We can save our country, but we've got to fight.
[2:38:43.180 --> 2:38:47.740]  We've got to throw ourselves into the fire and not wave the white flag of surrender.
[2:38:47.740 --> 2:38:50.580]  We will not let this country become a socialist country.
[2:38:50.580 --> 2:38:54.580]  We would never have President Trump in office if we just didn't support him, if he didn't
[2:38:54.580 --> 2:38:55.860]  throw himself in there.
[2:38:55.860 --> 2:38:58.500]  We can make miracles happen, but we've got to work together.
[2:38:58.500 --> 2:39:02.340]  We've got to support patriots.
[2:39:02.340 --> 2:39:09.060]  And impeachment trial, what a way to just rip up the Constitution and cheapen impeachment.
[2:39:09.060 --> 2:39:12.140]  The entire impeachment process is totally cheapened now.
[2:39:12.140 --> 2:39:18.300]  It's useless because of Nancy Pelosi sending us down this clown show, wasting our taxpayer
[2:39:18.300 --> 2:39:20.060]  dollars, wasting our time.
[2:39:20.060 --> 2:39:25.780]  It is funny because it looks so theatrical and faked and staged, but it's not funny because
[2:39:25.780 --> 2:39:29.300]  it's at the expense of the American people.
[2:39:29.300 --> 2:39:30.300]  You're right.
[2:39:30.300 --> 2:39:35.020]  I also see the media saying, oh, Trump's invincible now as a new tactic so that Trump
[2:39:35.020 --> 2:39:40.820]  is overconfident, doesn't worry about election fraud, and what Professor Robert Epstein others
[2:39:40.820 --> 2:39:42.260]  have warned him about.
[2:39:42.260 --> 2:39:44.220]  This isn't just companies censoring.
[2:39:44.220 --> 2:39:49.580]  This is companies using AI to block people communicating and to block candidates' information
[2:39:49.580 --> 2:39:53.540]  in real time and to even block Trump's campaign ads.
[2:39:53.540 --> 2:39:54.540]  It's just outrageous.
[2:39:54.540 --> 2:39:57.500]  I'd like to see action out of Trump.
[2:39:57.500 --> 2:40:01.060]  What are you asking Trump to do to fight back against the racketeering?
[2:40:01.060 --> 2:40:05.260]  Well, I'm asking him to speak up, first of all.
[2:40:05.260 --> 2:40:09.420]  I mean, he's been speaking up a lot about it and saying that there's election fraud,
[2:40:09.420 --> 2:40:13.260]  saying that there's corruption going on in the whole process.
[2:40:13.260 --> 2:40:18.740]  But I need him to take a little bit of a bolder stance and actually have action behind those
[2:40:18.740 --> 2:40:19.740]  words.
[2:40:19.740 --> 2:40:24.500]  Because if he doesn't do anything about it, we can have what happened to us at the midterm
[2:40:24.500 --> 2:40:25.500]  elections.
[2:40:25.500 --> 2:40:30.780]  In 2018, when I believe the election was stolen from us in many different ways and in many
[2:40:30.780 --> 2:40:34.820]  districts and they suddenly just found votes, these are the kinds of things that will happen
[2:40:34.820 --> 2:40:41.220]  if he doesn't put a very hard stance on it and do something, take action, take legislation.
[2:40:41.220 --> 2:40:46.100]  Same with even this impeachment trial, I don't even know why Mitch McConnell is entertaining
[2:40:46.100 --> 2:40:48.100]  this clown show.
[2:40:48.100 --> 2:40:52.660]  We actually have so many better things to do and I think that if we can take a bolder
[2:40:52.660 --> 2:40:56.220]  stance on it instead of just talking about it, that would be better.
[2:40:56.220 --> 2:40:59.460]  Well, I agree and I've been watching the Republican response.
[2:40:59.460 --> 2:41:05.140]  It has been pitch-poor and just more of these old lawyers walking around, glad-handing each
[2:41:05.140 --> 2:41:10.980]  other while they're facing a CHICOM Globalist funded assault through the media on America
[2:41:10.980 --> 2:41:14.020]  that's foreign and that's treasonous.
[2:41:14.020 --> 2:41:18.260]  Americans have their speech, but when the CHICOMs own most of Hollywood and are financing
[2:41:18.260 --> 2:41:23.740]  all this race war crap and Pelosi's working with MS-13 calling them all God's children
[2:41:23.740 --> 2:41:27.620]  and the Democrats, we know we're raking money off the top of drug dealing, it's just we've
[2:41:27.620 --> 2:41:31.620]  got cancer in this country and we're either going to break it up or it's going to take
[2:41:31.620 --> 2:41:34.100]  over and I think that's why the Democrats are so arrogant.
[2:41:34.100 --> 2:41:37.540]  They see how they have broken the back of these blue cities.
[2:41:37.540 --> 2:41:42.060]  They see the despair, they see the pain, they see the corruption, they see Soros putting
[2:41:42.060 --> 2:41:49.140]  the DAs and the judges in and the sheriffs in and they really have a plan to take over
[2:41:49.140 --> 2:41:53.540]  with the sanctuary cities and the rest of it and America has to wake up, mobilize, put
[2:41:53.540 --> 2:41:59.340]  people like you in Congress and absolutely take things back, but the spirit you have
[2:41:59.340 --> 2:42:00.340]  is infectious.
[2:42:00.340 --> 2:42:01.700]  So we're very, very excited.
[2:42:01.700 --> 2:42:08.020]  People should visit your website, dianaforcongress.com and we really appreciate you, Ms. Lorraine,
[2:42:08.020 --> 2:42:09.260]  for being on this today.
[2:42:09.260 --> 2:42:14.860]  Absolutely, for God, family and country, those are the things we need to bring back so much.
[2:42:14.860 --> 2:42:16.700]  We can do this, but we've got to work together.
[2:42:16.700 --> 2:42:17.940]  We can't sit on our behinds.
[2:42:17.940 --> 2:42:18.940]  We've got to fight.
[2:42:18.940 --> 2:42:22.100]  Boy, I bet the libtards don't like that slogan you've got on your shirt.
[2:42:22.100 --> 2:42:23.100]  God, family, country.
[2:42:23.100 --> 2:42:24.100]  Oh, they hate it.
[2:42:24.100 --> 2:42:25.100]  It's money.
[2:42:25.100 --> 2:42:28.380]  My shirt and my slogan, they're just walking triggers and it makes them scream and cry.
[2:42:28.380 --> 2:42:30.940]  Oh, you shouldn't put that in your campaign slogan.
[2:42:30.940 --> 2:42:31.940]  It's too bold.
[2:42:31.940 --> 2:42:32.940]  Well, guess what?
[2:42:32.940 --> 2:42:36.900]  God is not a dirty word and that's exactly why we're in this position we're at right
[2:42:36.900 --> 2:42:37.900]  now in our country.
[2:42:37.900 --> 2:42:40.380]  We've got to bring it back and we've got to be bold about it.
[2:42:40.380 --> 2:42:43.380]  Well, if you don't win for Congress, you need to be a talk show host.
[2:42:43.380 --> 2:42:44.380]  You're awesome and God bless you.
[2:42:44.380 --> 2:42:45.380]  We'll talk again soon.
[2:42:45.380 --> 2:42:46.380]  Thanks so much, Alex.
[2:42:46.380 --> 2:42:47.380]  God bless.
[2:42:47.380 --> 2:42:48.380]  Thank you.
[2:42:48.380 --> 2:42:49.380]  That's an awesome lady right there.
[2:42:49.380 --> 2:42:50.380]  All right.
[2:42:50.380 --> 2:42:51.380]  You're awesome.
[2:42:51.380 --> 2:42:54.060]  Your calls are coming up.
[2:42:54.060 --> 2:43:01.380]  This time of year, I'm always promoting Winner Sun, our high quality, organic vitamin D3,
[2:43:01.380 --> 2:43:06.940]  vitamin K combo because it's in the fall, it's in the winter, it's in the spring that
[2:43:06.940 --> 2:43:12.860]  people aren't getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin D it needs and then
[2:43:12.860 --> 2:43:18.500]  that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and other deadly viruses that
[2:43:18.500 --> 2:43:20.340]  are wreaking havoc out there.
[2:43:20.340 --> 2:43:25.660]  It's on record that you've got to have this to live not just to defend against these viruses.
[2:43:25.660 --> 2:43:30.860]  So right now we have Winner Sun still available even though we always order only so much for
[2:43:30.860 --> 2:43:32.500]  sale during the fall, winter and spring.
[2:43:32.500 --> 2:43:40.100]  I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off $23, despite the fact that
[2:43:40.100 --> 2:43:44.500]  I could sell it at full price because I want you to get it and I want to incentivize you
[2:43:44.500 --> 2:43:46.540]  protecting yourself and your family.
[2:43:46.540 --> 2:43:54.140]  So Winner Sun, taken under the tongue, super high quality, 40% off, available now at InfowarsStore.com.

[2:44:52.500 --> 2:44:55.260]  with Ultra 12.
[2:44:55.260 --> 2:44:59.780]  With the daily wear and tear of the environment on our skin, it's only natural that it starts
[2:44:59.780 --> 2:45:01.740]  to crack and take damage.
[2:45:01.740 --> 2:45:07.260]  Wind, heat, water, and age are tell-tale signs that it's time to start taking care of your
[2:45:07.260 --> 2:45:08.500]  skin.

[2:45:27.300 --> 2:45:32.380]  of the skin in a fast, non-greasy formula, small and easily stored.

[2:46:18.260 --> 2:46:19.420]  how important it is.
[2:46:19.420 --> 2:46:23.300]  The UN admits two billion people have low IQ or mental disability because they never
[2:46:23.300 --> 2:46:24.300]  got enough iodine.
[2:46:24.300 --> 2:46:29.460]  So just check it out for yourself, 40% off, m4store.com, and it funds the M4.
[2:46:29.460 --> 2:46:36.380]  And then vitamin D3 with vitamin K that fuses it together, super high quality, winter sun.
[2:46:36.380 --> 2:46:38.340]  You don't have sun during the winter.
[2:46:38.340 --> 2:46:40.940]  Sun helps your body produce the vitamin D3.
[2:46:40.940 --> 2:46:42.140]  That's why people get so sick.
[2:46:42.140 --> 2:46:43.140]  That's the main reason.
[2:46:43.140 --> 2:46:46.020]  Well, you can supplement with this under the tongue at higher absorption.
[2:46:46.020 --> 2:46:47.020]  It's amazing.
[2:46:47.020 --> 2:46:50.900]  There are three of these are on sale, but only for a limited time at m4store.com.
[2:46:50.900 --> 2:46:58.460]  Protect yourself and fund the M4 360 win.
[2:46:58.460 --> 2:47:28.420]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:47:28.420 --> 2:47:36.740]  It's well known that the Chinese, all billion, 300 plus million of them are malnourished on
[2:47:36.740 --> 2:47:44.260]  average and they don't get the nutrition they need.
[2:47:44.260 --> 2:47:49.140]  And so that when you see deadly viral outbreaks, they're the kill a lot of them.
[2:47:49.140 --> 2:47:55.180]  It's very sad that's happening, but the good news is people in the West and people in free
[2:47:55.180 --> 2:47:59.700]  market countries have a much better diet.
[2:47:59.700 --> 2:48:06.420]  Also in the West, we tend to get more sun and value it in Chinese culture and Japanese
[2:48:06.420 --> 2:48:07.420]  culture.
[2:48:07.420 --> 2:48:15.380]  It's seen as lower class to have tan skin that's they're not into tall, dark and handsome.
[2:48:15.380 --> 2:48:16.500]  Nothing against super white skin.
[2:48:16.500 --> 2:48:17.500]  I like brown skin.
[2:48:17.500 --> 2:48:22.460]  I like tan skin, but white skin can be pretty too.
[2:48:22.460 --> 2:48:26.980]  The point is it's not healthy if you don't get any sun.
[2:48:26.980 --> 2:48:32.140]  And so as bad as this is, and you've got major universities over there reporting Hong Kong
[2:48:32.140 --> 2:48:36.860]  saying it's got to be at least 44,000 that have it very high death rate and that this
[2:48:36.860 --> 2:48:39.460]  thing is out of control.
[2:48:39.460 --> 2:48:44.220]  The good news is God gave us things like vitamin D3 that's winter sun.
[2:48:44.220 --> 2:48:50.140]  The only other way to produce vitamin D3 is getting sunlight on your skin or taking it
[2:48:50.140 --> 2:48:52.340]  under the tongue.
[2:48:52.340 --> 2:48:56.780]  And I was sitting there last week thinking, man, I've been taking my winter sun.
[2:48:56.780 --> 2:48:57.780]  I'm an idiot.
[2:48:57.780 --> 2:49:00.980]  And I got to remember to get my children to take it, but they were luckily already habituated
[2:49:00.980 --> 2:49:01.980]  and we're taking it.
[2:49:01.980 --> 2:49:06.100]  And there's one reason they're not getting as sick as much as a lot of other kids they
[2:49:06.100 --> 2:49:07.100]  know.
[2:49:07.100 --> 2:49:13.860]  If you drop some of the tongue every day, tastes good, totally natural.
[2:49:13.860 --> 2:49:17.140]  Vitamin D3 and vitamin K together, and it tastes good.
[2:49:17.140 --> 2:49:18.620]  No additives to make it taste good.
[2:49:18.620 --> 2:49:22.020]  Just like true B12 tastes really good.
[2:49:22.020 --> 2:49:24.140]  So hey, what's the sweetener in this?
[2:49:24.140 --> 2:49:27.460]  B12, when it's organic, tastes sweet.
[2:49:27.460 --> 2:49:29.340]  I'm like any sweetener should ever taste it.
[2:49:29.340 --> 2:49:30.500]  I wouldn't really call that sweet.
[2:49:30.500 --> 2:49:34.260]  It's more of a little bit of a sweet taste.
[2:49:34.260 --> 2:49:38.820]  But both those products are at 40% off right now.
[2:49:38.820 --> 2:49:44.580]  I'm going to have to raise the price of it when we get it back in because I can't just
[2:49:44.580 --> 2:49:45.940]  always sell at that price.
[2:49:45.940 --> 2:49:51.380]  But because of the fact that you do have this pandemic breaking out and the rest of it,
[2:49:51.380 --> 2:49:53.140]  I do want to get as much of this out the door.
[2:49:53.140 --> 2:49:55.460]  It will sell out in the next week or so at that price.
[2:49:55.460 --> 2:50:00.940]  So get your winter sun and m4store.com, support the M4 war and be healthy and hope the virus
[2:50:00.940 --> 2:50:04.020]  doesn't become a big problem over here, though it has made its way over here.
[2:50:04.020 --> 2:50:08.820]  And hope because we're not perfect, but because we do have better constitutions here, whether
[2:50:08.820 --> 2:50:14.940]  we be black, white, older, young, that it will not race through the population as fast.
[2:50:14.940 --> 2:50:19.300]  Also, our genome is much more complex here in the United States.
[2:50:19.300 --> 2:50:23.940]  And diversity does create resistance to diseases.
[2:50:23.940 --> 2:50:27.740]  When you've got the population that almost has the exact same genetics and the Chinese
[2:50:27.740 --> 2:50:33.660]  are the most homogeneous group on earth for any large population, their genetics are the
[2:50:33.660 --> 2:50:35.580]  most close to each other.
[2:50:35.580 --> 2:50:39.580]  That also causes viral spread very, very fast in the studies as well.
[2:50:39.580 --> 2:50:44.700]  So it turns out our diversity is a strength here in the United States because we are so
[2:50:44.700 --> 2:50:48.340]  diverse, whether it's the white population, black population, or people that have mixed
[2:50:48.340 --> 2:50:49.340]  or whatever.
[2:50:49.340 --> 2:50:50.980]  That's just another scientific fact.
[2:50:50.980 --> 2:50:54.940]  So it's really bad in China, definitely super, super bad news.
[2:50:54.940 --> 2:50:59.100]  I mean, this is, this is terrible and it, it, it looks like it's going to get a lot worse.
[2:50:59.100 --> 2:51:02.580]  We've prepped it in the case and I'm just trying to convince myself of why things are
[2:51:02.580 --> 2:51:04.500]  going to be as bad here.
[2:51:04.500 --> 2:51:08.660]  And those are some mitigating factors, but so there's the good news in the bad news.
[2:51:08.660 --> 2:51:13.700]  Very sorry for the Chinese separately than I'm going to your calls.
[2:51:13.700 --> 2:51:17.740]  You notice last week, I'm not up here going, get your storeable food because of the outbreak.
[2:51:17.740 --> 2:51:20.140]  I was still hoping that it wasn't as bad as it looked.
[2:51:20.140 --> 2:51:21.740]  I was just hoping it was hype.
[2:51:21.740 --> 2:51:22.740]  It wasn't.
[2:51:22.740 --> 2:51:27.460]  Sure enough, I get the call that, hey, you got to raise food prices back to at least
[2:51:27.460 --> 2:51:31.900]  the regular level because we're having to buy more of it and other food companies have
[2:51:31.900 --> 2:51:32.900]  run out.
[2:51:32.900 --> 2:51:36.420]  We just private label at the factory with my Patriot supply and I have a special deal
[2:51:36.420 --> 2:51:38.100]  that I get the best price anybody has.
[2:51:38.100 --> 2:51:42.500]  Well, that deal is over right now because they are seven to 10 days for delivery.
[2:51:42.500 --> 2:51:43.500]  They have food on hand.
[2:51:43.500 --> 2:51:47.020]  They're having to buy more now and the price has gone up for them.
[2:51:47.020 --> 2:51:51.100]  And so they have had to go back to their regular prices that are still amongst the best you're
[2:51:51.100 --> 2:51:52.100]  going to find.
[2:51:52.100 --> 2:51:54.940]  So you order it in full or short.com.
[2:51:54.940 --> 2:51:58.940]  They just slap it in full or select sticker on it's the exact same fresh high quality
[2:51:58.940 --> 2:52:01.020]  food very well stored.
[2:52:01.020 --> 2:52:03.740]  But everybody should have storeable food regardless.
[2:52:03.740 --> 2:52:07.940]  But the fact is institutional buyers, major corporations are buying it up from them and
[2:52:07.940 --> 2:52:10.700]  they're buying it up from everybody else.
[2:52:10.700 --> 2:52:14.540]  And so most of the other big suppliers are out and can't even get more food because
[2:52:14.540 --> 2:52:16.300]  China supplies a lot of the world with food.
[2:52:16.300 --> 2:52:18.220]  They also import a lot of food.
[2:52:18.220 --> 2:52:21.940]  So just because we don't import a lot of Chinese food doesn't matter.
[2:52:21.940 --> 2:52:26.900]  Because once they shut down and once their shipping breaks down, that then runs out the
[2:52:26.900 --> 2:52:30.140]  supplies of people in surrounding areas.
[2:52:30.140 --> 2:52:34.180]  And so that's another reason the food prices are going up and the stock market also is
[2:52:34.180 --> 2:52:35.340]  taking a big plunge today.
[2:52:35.340 --> 2:52:37.700]  So it's just a gut level, good to have insurance.
[2:52:37.700 --> 2:52:38.700]  You can eat.
[2:52:38.700 --> 2:52:43.220]  I hope you never have to use it but going on camping trips or giving it away to the homeless
[2:52:43.220 --> 2:52:44.220]  or whatever.
[2:52:44.220 --> 2:52:48.500]  It's a quality storeable food so I just simply eat the storeable food when it starts getting
[2:52:48.500 --> 2:52:49.500]  close to being bad.
[2:52:49.500 --> 2:52:52.220]  But it lasts 25 years, folks.
[2:52:52.220 --> 2:52:55.980]  So again, I gave a bunch of homeless after it was about six, seven years old one time
[2:52:55.980 --> 2:53:00.900]  and I've still got the rest and I've also given family some of the storeable food.
[2:53:00.900 --> 2:53:04.420]  So it's an investment that you're going to be able to use one way or another with all
[2:53:04.420 --> 2:53:06.540]  the inflation and economic things.
[2:53:06.540 --> 2:53:13.180]  That's the real reason I have storeable food is not the virus but is the fact that it's
[2:53:13.180 --> 2:53:14.180]  the economy.
[2:53:14.180 --> 2:53:17.380]  It doesn't succeed in innovating with a bunch of new technologies and getting us out of
[2:53:17.380 --> 2:53:23.700]  this bubble into a new developmental renaissance expansion.
[2:53:23.700 --> 2:53:27.500]  There's going to be a mega global depression and no one can deny that and it's going to
[2:53:27.500 --> 2:53:28.500]  be hellish.
[2:53:28.500 --> 2:53:33.420]  You've got a large population in the West that's completely spoiled, rotten and they're
[2:53:33.420 --> 2:53:36.860]  black, they're white, they're old, they're young and they're a bunch of out of control
[2:53:36.860 --> 2:53:37.860]  zombies.
[2:53:37.860 --> 2:53:40.660]  And you can imagine what the homeless and all the rest of these heroin heads are going
[2:53:40.660 --> 2:53:43.780]  to do if the heroin ever gets turned off.
[2:53:43.780 --> 2:53:44.940]  It's a time bomb.
[2:53:44.940 --> 2:53:46.540]  So that's why people should have storeable foods.
[2:53:46.540 --> 2:53:49.700]  But regardless, everyone's moving on it right now.
[2:53:49.700 --> 2:53:55.380]  We've sold more storeable food in the last three days than we sold six months previous.
[2:53:55.380 --> 2:53:59.620]  And I guess it's because there I was ordering more food last week, not even thinking, well,
[2:53:59.620 --> 2:54:03.660]  if I'm ordering more food as a backup because I'm so concerned, why aren't I seeing this
[2:54:03.660 --> 2:54:04.660]  on air?
[2:54:04.660 --> 2:54:07.900]  And I just didn't go there but I'm going there now.
[2:54:07.900 --> 2:54:10.660]  So I would get your food purchases locked in right now.
[2:54:10.660 --> 2:54:13.060]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[2:54:13.060 --> 2:54:14.060]  We've got Patriot.
[2:54:14.060 --> 2:54:15.060]  We've got Aaron.
[2:54:15.060 --> 2:54:16.060]  We've got Jefferson.
[2:54:16.060 --> 2:54:17.060]  We've got Dylan.
[2:54:17.060 --> 2:54:18.060]  We've got Jeremy.
[2:54:18.060 --> 2:54:19.060]  We've got Danny.
[2:54:19.060 --> 2:54:20.060]  We've got Bart.
[2:54:20.060 --> 2:54:21.060]  We've got Jimmy.
[2:54:21.060 --> 2:54:22.060]  We've got Chris.
[2:54:22.060 --> 2:54:23.540]  Let's go ahead and talk to Bart in Georgia.
[2:54:23.540 --> 2:54:26.540]  Bart, thanks for calling and thanks for holding it on the air.
[2:54:26.540 --> 2:54:31.660]  Hey Alex, I just wanted to tell you that you are being live streamed on the Bart fine channel
[2:54:31.660 --> 2:54:33.900]  on YouTube and I have two points to make.
[2:54:33.900 --> 2:54:36.940]  I predicted this bio weapons attack when I was on the war.
[2:54:36.940 --> 2:54:41.220]  I mean, it was the Alex Jones show with Owen Shrower about two weeks ago.
[2:54:41.220 --> 2:54:44.500]  And the Democrats want us to put it as into martial law.
[2:54:44.500 --> 2:54:49.420]  It's the only way to disarm the people by disabling the Constitution.
[2:54:49.420 --> 2:54:56.580]  Number two, Trump needs to put the military on the borders and stop all flights from China.
[2:54:56.580 --> 2:54:57.780]  You're absolutely right.
[2:54:57.780 --> 2:55:01.460]  And that's what Philippines and other areas are doing that.
[2:55:01.460 --> 2:55:06.900]  That's the first thing we need to do.
[2:55:06.900 --> 2:55:08.660]  Let's go back Bart.
[2:55:08.660 --> 2:55:11.940]  Let's go back to your prediction because I don't remember the call but I believe you
[2:55:11.940 --> 2:55:12.940]  and I'm sure you did it.
[2:55:12.940 --> 2:55:17.100]  I've said on air that one of the wild cards would be a bio weapon release to hurt the
[2:55:17.100 --> 2:55:21.620]  economy and hurt Trump and hurt nationalists and then have a global response for global
[2:55:21.620 --> 2:55:22.620]  government.
[2:55:22.620 --> 2:55:24.540]  Bill Gates just came out and said that last week.
[2:55:24.540 --> 2:55:30.860]  Well, I'd like to add one thing based on testimony of a Soviet era defector.
[2:55:30.860 --> 2:55:36.900]  There was a smallpox insect virus weaponized smallpox virus that the Soviets had.
[2:55:36.900 --> 2:55:38.900]  Where's the virus now?
[2:55:38.900 --> 2:55:39.900]  Well, there's tons.
[2:55:39.900 --> 2:55:46.020]  I mean, look, with the gene editing software, the stuff they had in Russia in the U.S. 50
[2:55:46.020 --> 2:55:51.900]  years ago was like a caveman that knows how to make fire compared to a nuclear bomb.
[2:55:51.900 --> 2:55:56.820]  I mean, the stuff they've got now is just nightmarish.
[2:55:56.820 --> 2:56:02.060]  And the fact that they've got level four bio weapon labs at universities and are letting
[2:56:02.060 --> 2:56:06.540]  foreign Chinese students in, who of course now they think ran off with the virus.
[2:56:06.540 --> 2:56:07.540]  What the hell?
[2:56:07.540 --> 2:56:10.420]  That's where spies main target is.
[2:56:10.420 --> 2:56:15.220]  They've got things in facilities they shouldn't be making, period.
[2:56:15.220 --> 2:56:18.180]  Thank you, Bart.
[2:56:18.180 --> 2:56:19.780]  I appreciate your call.
[2:56:19.780 --> 2:56:22.900]  Yeah, you could see this coming from a thousand miles away.
[2:56:22.900 --> 2:56:25.300]  Let's go to Patriot in California.
[2:56:25.300 --> 2:56:26.300]  Patriot are on the air.
[2:56:26.300 --> 2:56:29.620]  Hey, thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[2:56:29.620 --> 2:56:34.740]  Real quick, whoever you had on there against Nancy Pelosi, God's family country.
[2:56:34.740 --> 2:56:35.740]  That's a great slogan there.
[2:56:35.740 --> 2:56:38.740]  Yeah, it's actually something that I've lived by and I thought that was kind of our...
[2:56:38.740 --> 2:56:39.740]  Oh, yeah.
[2:56:39.740 --> 2:56:42.980]  That lady's very well spoken and she's pretty, but by pretty, I mean, she has a glow.
[2:56:42.980 --> 2:56:43.980]  She certainly...
[2:56:43.980 --> 2:56:50.860]  I mean, I'd love to have hers to replace Nancy Pelosi, my goodness, but you heard the Republican
[2:56:50.860 --> 2:56:55.580]  Blue Bloods won't even back her because the Republican Blue Bloods are a bunch of trash.
[2:56:55.580 --> 2:57:00.660]  You know, there's a lot of things going on right now and that power struggle in the Republican
[2:57:00.660 --> 2:57:01.660]  Party itself.
[2:57:01.660 --> 2:57:02.660]  You're right about that.
[2:57:02.660 --> 2:57:06.940]  You know, I want to talk about this coronavirus, what you guys are touching on, and something
[2:57:06.940 --> 2:57:10.020]  that people aren't paying attention to is the islands of Hawaii.
[2:57:10.020 --> 2:57:16.180]  Now, Honolulu specifically, they have a lot of flight from China directly back and forth
[2:57:16.180 --> 2:57:20.260]  from the island and I've been looking into it and they are trying to sound the alarm.
[2:57:20.260 --> 2:57:25.780]  They have no advance screening at their airport and they are trying to actually deport Chinese
[2:57:25.780 --> 2:57:30.900]  students and citizens back to China from the island because if an outbreak starts on an
[2:57:30.900 --> 2:57:33.500]  island like that, there's nowhere for them to go.
[2:57:33.500 --> 2:57:36.860]  Those are American citizens that are the direct targets of this virus.
[2:57:36.860 --> 2:57:37.860]  Hold on, stay there.
[2:57:37.860 --> 2:57:38.860]  Let's talk about that.
[2:57:38.860 --> 2:57:44.500]  We'll be right back with hour number four.
[2:57:44.500 --> 2:57:51.860]  I spend a lot of time reminding the Info Wars family of listeners and viewers that without
[2:57:51.860 --> 2:57:56.060]  you, we won't be on the air and I spent a lot of time thanking you, but I really think
[2:57:56.060 --> 2:58:00.060]  you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for
[2:58:00.060 --> 2:58:04.100]  the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reveres, but something I should spend
[2:58:04.100 --> 2:58:10.220]  more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing.
[2:58:10.220 --> 2:58:13.500]  You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air
[2:58:13.500 --> 2:58:15.380]  filtration, the water filtration.
[2:58:15.380 --> 2:58:20.420]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there and you can't fund
[2:58:20.420 --> 2:58:25.060]  an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard.
[2:58:25.060 --> 2:58:28.940]  So it's not a burden to support Info Wars.
[2:58:28.940 --> 2:58:36.020]  It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes
[2:58:36.020 --> 2:58:39.580]  your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.

[3:00:05.800 --> 3:00:17.480]  We are back live. We are Broadcasting World One. I'm your host Alex Jones. And yes, I've
[3:00:17.480 --> 3:00:20.920]  noticed that they're not really screening anybody coming out of China into Hawaii, into
[3:00:20.920 --> 3:00:28.520]  San Francisco, into Seattle, into LA. Because we're not supposed to screen people. We don't
[3:00:28.520 --> 3:00:34.760]  do that. We bring people from the Congo here illegally and just the local media worships
[3:00:34.760 --> 3:00:41.760]  at the San Antonio and says, it's so good to do. Yeah, there it is. There it is in the
[3:00:41.760 --> 3:00:49.880]  Star Advertisers at Honolulu Airport, not among five screening certain passengers for
[3:00:49.880 --> 3:00:56.240]  virus. So there you go. But don't you worry, TSA is going to fondle your testicles to
[3:00:56.240 --> 3:01:01.520]  make sure Bin Laden didn't hide in your pants. But oh, and Trump tries to stop people from
[3:01:01.520 --> 3:01:07.240]  six Muslim nations that don't even have any real passports and that said they want to
[3:01:07.240 --> 3:01:12.040]  blow the US up. He's the bad guy. So it's all just political correctness as a suicide
[3:01:12.040 --> 3:01:19.640]  pack. Finishing up chase the Patriot. It's just crazy. We need action now.
[3:01:19.640 --> 3:01:25.280]  Yeah, and you bring up what's going on with the Ebola from the Congo and directly from
[3:01:25.280 --> 3:01:30.680]  San Antonio. You can look this one up as well. Portland, Maine is the main drop off where
[3:01:30.680 --> 3:01:35.200]  they are busing people in by the hundreds, even the thousands over the last year or so.
[3:01:35.200 --> 3:01:40.440]  And to the point where the community is up, you know, an outrage to a certain extent,
[3:01:40.440 --> 3:01:44.520]  they invited Michelle Malkin to come and speak and they canceled her and tried to blackball
[3:01:44.520 --> 3:01:48.800]  her from coming and speaking in their local college. That's where this is crazy, Alex.
[3:01:48.800 --> 3:01:52.360]  They're not screening people. And look, I'm all for legal immigration. People want to
[3:01:52.360 --> 3:01:56.760]  come through the right way. That's all good. But this is not what we're seeing. It's a breakdown
[3:01:56.760 --> 3:02:01.040]  by the United Nations. Everything is the breakdown of our border. And if a country doesn't have
[3:02:01.040 --> 3:02:05.920]  a border, it's not a country anymore. Thank you, sir. Great points. All right, let's go
[3:02:05.920 --> 3:02:14.720]  to Jeremy in Texas. Go ahead, Jeremy. Hey, Alex, there's no doubt that this virus is
[3:02:14.720 --> 3:02:21.680]  actually a market virus designed to harm Trump's economy. I think the writing's on the wall.
[3:02:21.680 --> 3:02:26.480]  Chinese people are super easy to control the easiest in the world. And what better time
[3:02:26.480 --> 3:02:31.280]  than right before the election to have some, you know, macabre of a virus roaming around
[3:02:31.280 --> 3:02:37.200]  the earth where they can shut down quarantine taxes, take our guns. I mean, it's just the
[3:02:37.200 --> 3:02:42.480]  perfect little Rosetta. Well, that's right. There are a lot of amazing Chinese people
[3:02:42.480 --> 3:02:47.280]  and they have high accused, but they operate like robots and the Chinese state rags about
[3:02:47.280 --> 3:02:51.840]  it. It's very dangerous. Right. Now, we're going to actually believe the Chinese media.
[3:02:51.840 --> 3:02:55.920]  They're going to be starting the narrative for us. You know, I thought we didn't believe
[3:02:55.920 --> 3:02:59.640]  fake news, but all of a sudden we're supposed to follow Chinese coming media. We have three
[3:02:59.640 --> 3:03:04.240]  or four videos. A guy falls over, hit his head and nurses crying. I'm supposed to buy
[3:03:04.240 --> 3:03:10.040]  that. You're absolutely right, sir. And it's turning out everything the chai comms are
[3:03:10.040 --> 3:03:14.960]  telling us is complete lies. But if you say the Chinese government lies, our controlled
[3:03:14.960 --> 3:03:19.480]  media will say it's fake news. We must believe the communist Chinese. Xi Jinping is going
[3:03:19.480 --> 3:03:26.480]  to stop Trump. The Washington Post said. Right. Real quick. Actually, last week you said you're
[3:03:26.480 --> 3:03:31.000]  looking for mottos, you know, Tom Hanks says there's no current in baseball or there's no
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:35.960]  hiding an info wars. So all of you people that are out to get us because we're in liberty
[3:03:35.960 --> 3:03:41.160]  movement, there's no hiding an info wars. So yeah, absolutely. The Asian team wants
[3:03:41.160 --> 3:03:45.800]  to come after Trump. Everyone's pissed off at Trump. Trump's dealing with a time bomb
[3:03:45.800 --> 3:03:50.080]  right now. Like as you mentioned with, you know, cutting the heroin off and heroin addicts.
[3:03:50.080 --> 3:03:53.360]  Well, taxation is kind of that heroin from the heroin addicts. Why can't Trump just
[3:03:53.360 --> 3:03:57.680]  end the Federal Reserve and bring troops from? Why do you send 20,000 more troops into the
[3:03:57.680 --> 3:03:59.760]  Middle East because of Iran?
[3:03:59.760 --> 3:04:04.240]  No, you're absolutely right. Incredible points. Anything else, Jeremy?
[3:04:04.240 --> 3:04:08.520]  Yeah, can I plug my new book real quick? Yes.
[3:04:08.520 --> 3:04:12.680]  Lenio common sense, the philosophy of liberty and the cure for life. Lenio common sense,
[3:04:12.680 --> 3:04:16.800]  the philosophy of liberty and the cure for life. And that's 812 pages book of war. It's
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:19.480]  not politically correct. You're not going to find a lot of quotes.
[3:04:19.480 --> 3:04:23.600]  Send me a copy. Make sure I get it. Send me a copy saying give this to Alex Jones. Thank
[3:04:23.600 --> 3:04:31.520]  you, Jeremy. And if you can see right here, here's the markets. We've got Dow down 398
[3:04:31.520 --> 3:04:39.560]  points, S&P down 46 points, NASDAQ down 159 points. And you've got some of the other indexes
[3:04:39.560 --> 3:04:47.280]  right there. Infowars.com, News Wars.com, Kamara's News today. War calls straight ahead
[3:04:47.280 --> 3:05:14.120]  in 60 seconds.
[3:05:14.120 --> 3:05:21.280]  That's why Cobra is launching operations to trigger race war, mass shootings and bombings,
[3:05:21.280 --> 3:05:28.360]  which will be blamed on those loyal to America. Anyone once we stage these attacks that does
[3:05:28.360 --> 3:05:37.080]  not blame it on Trump will also be targeted by Cobra in the future. You see, when you
[3:05:37.080 --> 3:05:44.400]  expose our false flags and fake media, I will carry out attacks and then blame you like
[3:05:44.400 --> 3:06:03.080]  we've done with Alex Jones, blaming him for mass shootings we committed. Hey, oh, Cobra.
[3:06:03.080 --> 3:06:08.360]  Hong Kong University is reporting according to the Hong Kong Post that they estimate
[3:06:08.360 --> 3:06:15.920]  there's 44,000 now infected. The way they hyped up SARS when it was not killing a lot
[3:06:15.920 --> 3:06:19.520]  of people years ago was a little telltale sign that they were getting the infrastructure
[3:06:19.520 --> 3:06:25.760]  in place, using this in the future as the type of virus to take control. And I totally
[3:06:25.760 --> 3:06:30.320]  agree with the callers that this is the way to go after the world economy and the way
[3:06:30.320 --> 3:06:34.520]  they believed it to get Trump out of office. Because they know with an economy it's better
[3:06:34.520 --> 3:06:40.400]  than it was that they don't have a chance of beating him even with a major election
[3:06:40.400 --> 3:06:45.320]  fraud. He's so popular right now. I said it months ago, I said one of the curve balls
[3:06:45.320 --> 3:06:50.920]  snookering him into a war or some type of bio weapon release and this thing clearly
[3:06:50.920 --> 3:06:57.880]  is weaponized. Taking your phone calls right now. Dylan's in Arizona says he went to Home
[3:06:57.880 --> 3:07:02.000]  Depot and they're sold out of the antiviral mask. That's being reported. We're going to
[3:07:02.000 --> 3:07:06.480]  send a reporter there and see if that's the case here. What did you witness, Dylan?
[3:07:06.480 --> 3:07:13.120]  Hi, Alex. Yeah, so I've actually been pretty worried about this coronavirus thing because
[3:07:13.120 --> 3:07:17.600]  I live in Mesa, Arizona. We're only three miles from ASU and there's a pretty high
[3:07:17.600 --> 3:07:21.160]  population of Chinese nationals that go to school here. So I was kind of always watching
[3:07:21.160 --> 3:07:25.600]  it yesterday. I just kind of had a feeling it was going to be a news day after that
[3:07:25.600 --> 3:07:30.320]  Colby thing. Then there was the rocket in Iraq and I just knew it was coming. I went
[3:07:30.320 --> 3:07:36.760]  to Home Depot and I saw these two Chinese nationals there. They didn't speak English
[3:07:36.760 --> 3:07:41.680]  as far as I could tell and they had the masks on and they went in the store and they emptied
[3:07:41.680 --> 3:07:46.560]  the shelves. They bought about 12 cases of these masks. They completely emptied the
[3:07:46.560 --> 3:07:53.120]  whole store out and so I talked to the one of them back to China. Yeah, that's actually
[3:07:53.120 --> 3:07:55.800]  what he told me. I was talking to the Home Depot associate. He said that they're shipping
[3:07:55.800 --> 3:08:00.800]  them back to China and not only that, that the import duties are being completely ignored
[3:08:00.800 --> 3:08:04.920]  as what he heard, that they're not inspecting the boxes. They're not charging import duties.
[3:08:04.920 --> 3:08:10.920]  They're just waving them through. So it's pretty crazy. I kind of wonder if this is
[3:08:10.920 --> 3:08:14.840]  going to blow over or what. I wasn't really that worried until I saw that. I always thought
[3:08:14.840 --> 3:08:19.000]  since we were at ASU, we might have one of the early states and then it came out a couple
[3:08:19.000 --> 3:08:24.400]  of hours later, first confirmed case in Arizona, the fifth state, I think we were. So it's
[3:08:24.400 --> 3:08:30.040]  gotten me a little worried, you know. I'm a little worried as well. In fact, I'm worried
[3:08:30.040 --> 3:08:35.680]  a lot because this has Bill and Melinda Gates fingerprints all over it. They had an emergency
[3:08:35.680 --> 3:08:40.200]  exercise, I'm sure, you know, three months ago with 65 million dead. They've talked about
[3:08:40.200 --> 3:08:44.720]  using a virus like this to bring in world government. Now it turns out they funded the
[3:08:44.720 --> 3:08:50.560]  company that patented this virus a few years ago. And so and then now they're saying Chai
[3:08:50.560 --> 3:08:56.560]  comms may have stolen it out of a lab in Canada. And that's that's CBC reporting that. So
[3:08:56.560 --> 3:09:01.000]  it's getting really weird, my friend. Yeah, it's kind of ridiculous. You know, I mean,
[3:09:01.000 --> 3:09:04.280]  we were told it was from the bats, but maybe that wasn't the case. Maybe that's just to
[3:09:04.280 --> 3:09:09.840]  hide what it really is. Oh, they're now admitting it wasn't from the bats. You're absolutely
[3:09:09.840 --> 3:09:14.040]  right. Thank you, Dylan. Wow. Okay, these are all great colors. We got to move quicker.
[3:09:14.040 --> 3:09:19.240]  Who is up next? Let's talk to Johnny and Denmark. Johnny, thanks for holding. I didn't
[3:09:19.240 --> 3:09:23.200]  notice you were in Denmark. I would have gone to you earlier. Go ahead, Johnny. Hi, Alex.
[3:09:23.200 --> 3:09:27.640]  I hope you remember me. I remember you. I do. You called in your big customer. Thank you,
[3:09:27.640 --> 3:09:33.040]  sir. Yes, I claim on me your biggest customer in Europe until I'm shown conclusive evidence
[3:09:33.040 --> 3:09:38.120]  to the contrary. I'll continue to claim that 19 K us in your store last year alone. You're
[3:09:38.120 --> 3:09:44.680]  amazing. We couldn't fight the globalist without you, sir. Oh, and when I see you and Owen
[3:09:44.680 --> 3:09:49.800]  and Savannah and a lot of you doing what you're doing these days, it's all going to a good
[3:09:49.800 --> 3:09:56.760]  cause. Oh, believe me, we had a better strategy than to battle these giant Democrat law firms
[3:09:56.760 --> 3:10:02.880]  who admit they want to railroad us and absolutely shut us down. But with your support, we are
[3:10:02.880 --> 3:10:07.040]  having whole other infrastructures can leave it at that and we are fighting them and they
[3:10:07.040 --> 3:10:11.440]  can't stand it. That's why they put the fake news that we're losing when it's not true.
[3:10:11.440 --> 3:10:20.560]  And so God bless you. Well, now that you mentioned that, before I get some of my intended subject,
[3:10:20.560 --> 3:10:26.240]  I just been sort of dying to tell you, maybe your lawyers, it's probably because you seem
[3:10:26.240 --> 3:10:33.080]  to have competent lawyers, Bob Barnes and others. But if they haven't suggested this
[3:10:33.080 --> 3:10:37.120]  or if they're not pursuing this, I would strongly encourage them to. If you're going to sue
[3:10:37.120 --> 3:10:43.640]  companies like, let's say Facebook, who had Twitter, who sort of trade on the equivocation
[3:10:43.640 --> 3:10:48.960]  of being a platform when it suits them and being a publisher when it suits them, sue
[3:10:48.960 --> 3:10:55.880]  them both in criminal and civil court. So they can't slip away. So if they say they're
[3:10:55.880 --> 3:11:02.440]  the one, then you get them in the other because they can't be both. And Mark Zuckerberg, who's
[3:11:02.440 --> 3:11:07.040]  supposed to be this genius, as Steve Pochette pointed out, he's just a front man for the
[3:11:07.040 --> 3:11:13.440]  UNWO. When he did the one thing, it seems, that was out of his own will and went to Washington
[3:11:13.440 --> 3:11:18.520]  and came, he was a publisher. He made such a horrible blunder. It could bankrupt him
[3:11:18.520 --> 3:11:23.520]  and Facebook. And as a matter of fact, I'm a member of a Facebook group called Facebook
[3:11:23.520 --> 3:11:31.480]  Censorship Class Action Lawsuit, which is actually going to pursue a one trillion dollar
[3:11:31.480 --> 3:11:38.600]  class action lawsuit against Facebook. And before anyone dismisses that as exaggeration,
[3:11:38.600 --> 3:11:42.480]  if you had a hundred million dollars, I'm sorry, a hundred million people who've been
[3:11:42.480 --> 3:11:47.000]  damaged an average of $10,000 a piece, which is not hard to imagine, that comes out to
[3:11:47.000 --> 3:11:50.600]  a trillion dollars. And if your lawyers want to talk to me, put them on the phone with
[3:11:50.600 --> 3:11:54.840]  me because I'm actually a decades experienced legal power professional and good enough
[3:11:54.840 --> 3:11:58.520]  to know that barns in the lot there are good lawyers.
[3:11:58.520 --> 3:12:05.800]  Sure, give us your name and your info. Look, I appreciate your call. Here's what's happened.
[3:12:05.800 --> 3:12:11.520]  They don't care. I've seen the documents with natural news. They're not even in a lawsuit
[3:12:11.520 --> 3:12:15.960]  for a bankruptcy court in California. They're just added their names, just put in there
[3:12:15.960 --> 3:12:21.560]  and then the judge orders their website taken down. Well, I just learned that similar thing
[3:12:21.560 --> 3:12:29.760]  was done to me. Put into bankruptcy when there's not even a connection. And it's the same deal.
[3:12:29.760 --> 3:12:35.160]  This is what has happened. And in force is not in bankruptcy, folks. The Democrats just
[3:12:35.160 --> 3:12:40.400]  file stuff like this so they can run the headline. And then I've got major newspapers calling
[3:12:40.400 --> 3:12:44.960]  up going, Hey, you're going bankrupt. I go, excuse me, because somebody just files a bankruptcy
[3:12:44.960 --> 3:12:51.520]  claim. It's but they do that to I mean, to run the type of stuff for witnessing. It's
[3:12:51.520 --> 3:12:59.240]  it is unbelievable. How desperate the deep state has gotten and the things they're planning
[3:12:59.240 --> 3:13:03.800]  the things they're doing, they don't care. They're going for broke. It's it's frightening.
[3:13:03.800 --> 3:13:07.920]  Let's go to John in Florida. John, thanks for holding her on the air.
[3:13:07.920 --> 3:13:13.040]  It's nice speaking to you. Finally, Alex, boy, you are a hard guy to get ahold of. Well,
[3:13:13.040 --> 3:13:16.280]  I'm honored to talk to you, brother. What's on your mind, John? Well, we have a couple
[3:13:16.280 --> 3:13:21.800]  of different things, but I want to bring on up the Corona situation first. The bottom
[3:13:21.800 --> 3:13:28.320]  line is that, you know, we're putting to the side a little bit too much Bill and Melinda
[3:13:28.320 --> 3:13:36.600]  with their patent and also the vaccine for this Corona virus. We know what they did
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:42.160]  in Africa. We thousands, maybe millions of people that they've injected with all different
[3:13:42.160 --> 3:13:47.600]  types of things. I just wanted to bring up one thing. Everybody is saying that this disease
[3:13:47.600 --> 3:13:58.640]  is started via contact with bad animals. China is right now for the past couple of years.
[3:13:58.640 --> 3:14:05.960]  They have what is called the African black swine flu that has killed off over two thirds
[3:14:05.960 --> 3:14:18.640]  of the swine population in China. Maybe that's where it all came from. Just a thought, Alex.
[3:14:18.640 --> 3:14:25.680]  What's your thought on that? You know, I don't know, sir. I just know that China in many
[3:14:25.680 --> 3:14:32.480]  ways is a hellhole. And it's the model of the New World Order. And it's who the Washington
[3:14:32.480 --> 3:14:37.160]  Post says they hope, quote, defeats Trump and defeats America. And they go to Davos and praise
[3:14:37.160 --> 3:14:40.840]  it because the elites can do whatever they want there. And the people are treated like
[3:14:40.840 --> 3:14:47.440]  animals. And it's very, very sad. And I just know that if the numbers, even their numbers
[3:14:47.440 --> 3:14:52.080]  of what they say, the amount of people dying from this virus, the chai comms say 2% die.
[3:14:52.080 --> 3:14:56.360]  That's thousands of times more deadly than the average flu. Okay. And this is again a
[3:14:56.360 --> 3:15:02.520]  coronavirus attacks the lungs mainly. If that's true, and the numbers coming out of Landsat
[3:15:02.520 --> 3:15:12.800]  is above 50% death rate. Landsat's respected. So, but I just refuse to believe that because
[3:15:12.800 --> 3:15:17.120]  if that's really what's going on, this is a galactic level cover up. And when the truth
[3:15:17.120 --> 3:15:21.760]  of it comes out, it could easily take the world economy into a full blown depression.
[3:15:21.760 --> 3:15:26.600]  So I just as a father and as an American, I know we're in a bubble. I know it's all
[3:15:26.600 --> 3:15:31.960]  BS. But when they pop it, it's gonna hurt. So I don't know, buddy. What do you think?
[3:15:31.960 --> 3:15:39.160]  Well, you know, again, everything is so hidden today. We don't know. You know, sometimes
[3:15:39.160 --> 3:15:44.160]  we think we've got all the players, you know, put in line with the depopulation and all
[3:15:44.160 --> 3:15:48.880]  of the other things that like Bill Gates has discussed in the past. And you have to still
[3:15:48.880 --> 3:15:53.880]  keep all of those in your mind. I agree. God bless you. We can all agree. These are troubled
[3:15:53.880 --> 3:15:59.280]  times, right? So do you know who's on your wireless network? Whether it's a big company

[3:19:22.600 --> 3:19:27.760]  it's the good halogen, fluoride, the bad halogen. And people told me about it for years and
[3:19:27.760 --> 3:19:33.200]  I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Group like eight years ago
[3:19:33.200 --> 3:19:40.960]  is sort of taking true iodine, atomic iodine. We've got it back in stock X2, 40% off right

[3:19:55.960 --> 3:20:12.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. Hello, this is Hank Hill and I'm telling you what
[3:20:12.600 --> 3:20:29.000]  you need to listen to Alex Jones. Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide. It's
[3:20:29.000 --> 3:20:41.600]  Alex Jones. Patty in Texas. Ask the question. Coronavirus, same bio research lab as Ebola.
[3:20:41.600 --> 3:20:45.320]  Yes, some of the same labs. That's the whole point is you start looking at this and it's
[3:20:45.320 --> 3:20:49.120]  just you've got to be kidding. And Chinese being kicked out of labs that are level four
[3:20:49.120 --> 3:20:53.040]  that have it for saying they believe they're spies and they stole it. And that's how they
[3:20:53.040 --> 3:20:56.040]  got it. And that's why they're freaking out because they look at the coronavirus and it
[3:20:56.040 --> 3:21:02.080]  was a lab manipulated and created in a lab. They think in Canada. That's mainstream news
[3:21:02.080 --> 3:21:08.160]  right now. And then you find out four separate times SARS got out of labs in China. That's
[3:21:08.160 --> 3:21:13.920]  it lands it. What? What the hell's up with the chai comms, man? They're all obsessed
[3:21:13.920 --> 3:21:20.280]  with mask and everything and they're over there constantly fiddle jacking with all this stuff.
[3:21:20.280 --> 3:21:28.760]  Talk about playing with fire. It's like these mad scientists are like a bunch of gremlins
[3:21:28.760 --> 3:21:33.880]  or something running around trying to kill everybody. You know, all these science fiction
[3:21:33.880 --> 3:21:38.400]  movies. You found out the villains, some crazy mad scientist. And I used to watch it in a
[3:21:38.400 --> 3:21:42.480]  kid. Why is it always a mad scientist that's the villain? That's because the people that
[3:21:42.480 --> 3:21:47.760]  wrote the comic book stuff later even found out we're reading about this stuff in real
[3:21:47.760 --> 3:21:53.560]  science and the type of crazy people there are in that are scientists. Some of the craziest
[3:21:53.560 --> 3:22:02.640]  people I've ever met are scientists. And they're obsessed with control like all these eugenicists
[3:22:02.640 --> 3:22:14.160]  all these globalists. Again, I have covered events where they have scientists get up and
[3:22:14.160 --> 3:22:19.400]  say we need to kill 9% of humans. Thank God Ebola is going to go airborne and the people
[3:22:19.400 --> 3:22:25.000]  clapped for three minutes. Some cry. That was the Texas Academy of Sciences for Eric
[3:22:25.000 --> 3:22:30.320]  Bianca. That was on the news. And then his graduate students started attacking me, defending
[3:22:30.320 --> 3:22:37.800]  him. Thank God he wants to kill the humans. We're bad. He's too liberal. We need to kill
[3:22:37.800 --> 3:22:45.240]  everyone. And you hear that. It sounds crazy. It sounded crazy when I put in game out 13
[3:22:45.240 --> 3:22:49.840]  years ago. Not crazy now because you turn on the news. Humans are bad. Thank God will
[3:22:49.840 --> 3:22:54.520]  probably kill each other. NBC News. Soon the age of humans will be over. Thank God. Big
[3:22:54.520 --> 3:23:00.200]  Tech's got a plan for the post human world. Yay. We're like you're a bunch of psychotics.
[3:23:00.200 --> 3:23:09.880]  Stop it. You also want this coming up. I want to go to all your calls, but I just know this.
[3:23:09.880 --> 3:23:15.360]  It turns out this is lab made, which it is and anybody that I know gets hurt by it. The
[3:23:15.360 --> 3:23:19.400]  vaccines, the globalists, what they're pushing the 5g is an attack on me and my family. And
[3:23:19.400 --> 3:23:23.080]  I'm not going to take physical attacks much longer. Doesn't mean I'm going to cook something
[3:23:23.080 --> 3:23:29.680]  up. I'm just saying the laws of the way the world works is that all this soft kill scientific
[3:23:29.680 --> 3:23:34.640]  garbage sneaking around doing this stuff. When I know people personally whose children
[3:23:34.640 --> 3:23:40.680]  died from vaccines, I had family hurt by vaccines crippled for life. The doctors told my grandmother
[3:23:40.680 --> 3:23:49.240]  the polio shot gave it to her. I've had enough. I'm not taking the secret experimentation.
[3:23:49.240 --> 3:23:55.240]  They didn't just shoot up poor black folks with syphilis folks. They just got caught
[3:23:55.240 --> 3:24:01.440]  doing that. And black people are worth just as much as white people. I don't bring that
[3:24:01.440 --> 3:24:06.680]  up like, oh, it's not just the black folks. My point is, is that it's happening to every
[3:24:06.680 --> 3:24:19.760]  one. And I'm tired of it. Get off my back. But these scientists don't want to straight
[3:24:19.760 --> 3:24:26.640]  up fight. They want to creep around instead of walking right up to you and stabbing you
[3:24:26.640 --> 3:24:35.680]  right in the heart. There you go. Oh, I've got a vaccine for you. Oh, loving. And then
[3:24:35.680 --> 3:24:39.640]  you die five years later from the cancer viruses they injected you with, or you fight it and
[3:24:39.640 --> 3:24:43.920]  spend a million dollars or half a million dollars beating the cancer takes half your
[3:24:43.920 --> 3:24:59.280]  life off. But that's okay. Because Tim Cook's gay. That's insane. Everything's insane. Tim
[3:24:59.280 --> 3:25:06.600]  Cook has slave factories in China on record, but it's okay because he hops around. I mean,
[3:25:06.600 --> 3:25:10.520]  it's just fun to do that sometimes, isn't it? Because that's the point we've gotten a bunch
[3:25:10.520 --> 3:25:16.800]  of psycho secret scientist engineer nutcases that see us all as animals and then better
[3:25:16.800 --> 3:25:26.520]  than us. Because we never stand up to him. Well, guess what? You're going to get stood
[3:25:26.520 --> 3:25:37.720]  up to Jack. Think where he's been, folks. I mean, he's gone. Patty in Texas. Thanks
[3:25:37.720 --> 3:25:44.240]  for holding on here. Go ahead. Hey, Alex, thanks for taking my call. Welcome. I'm going
[3:25:44.240 --> 3:25:51.600]  to start with the Ebola outbreak in Liberia a few years ago. There were two labs that
[3:25:51.600 --> 3:25:56.000]  were right in the middle of where the outbreak happened. One lab was being funded by Bill
[3:25:56.000 --> 3:26:07.800]  Gates. The other lab was the US Army Research Lab. And the woman that was in the Canada
[3:26:07.800 --> 3:26:14.200]  Winnipeg lab that was just caught stealing the coronavirus and giving it to China, she
[3:26:14.200 --> 3:26:24.640]  worked for that lab that US military US Army Research Lab. So I think that that's all connected.
[3:26:24.640 --> 3:26:35.680]  And I don't think for a moment that this is not engineered to have been either used by
[3:26:35.680 --> 3:26:41.240]  China against their enemies or they're killing their own people off. That it's not an accident
[3:26:41.240 --> 3:26:47.080]  and it's not something by a food market. This is all weaponized.
[3:26:47.080 --> 3:26:52.960]  And they use it to control and set up the framework for world government. And China signed
[3:26:52.960 --> 3:26:57.320]  on to the global population plan, even had one child policy killing more than 50 million
[3:26:57.320 --> 3:27:02.440]  of their own girls. You're absolutely right. And I've seen that news that the Ebola outbreaks
[3:27:02.440 --> 3:27:08.160]  were linked to the same person and linked to the other lab. And what's crazy is the
[3:27:08.160 --> 3:27:13.600]  African news, they say, listen, we're being injected with this Ebola. We know it's coming
[3:27:13.600 --> 3:27:19.000]  out of the UN labs and they've even attacked some of the labs, as you know. So the Africans
[3:27:19.000 --> 3:27:25.320]  have figured it out. It's the same people involved. It's the exact
[3:27:25.320 --> 3:27:34.320]  same labs that are involved. So I don't know if what has happened to that Chinese scientist,
[3:27:34.320 --> 3:27:41.160]  the woman scientist and her husband, but she's the one that's involved in all of it. She's
[3:27:41.160 --> 3:27:47.880]  at least one of them. And we're talking about a 12th monkey type
[3:27:47.880 --> 3:27:51.920]  scenario here potentially. Great point. Anything else you'd like to add?
[3:27:51.920 --> 3:27:57.920]  No, if this thing breaks out in the United States, we're going to have a lower death
[3:27:57.920 --> 3:28:01.880]  rate. We're still going to have a very high death rate, but lower than the Chinese. But
[3:28:01.880 --> 3:28:07.040]  I think that if it comes here, it's going to be used to invoke martial law.
[3:28:07.040 --> 3:28:10.520]  You sound like you know what you're talking about. Are you a nurse or something?
[3:28:10.520 --> 3:28:15.480]  No, I come from an oil-filled family. And I've had some dealings with the Bushes and
[3:28:15.480 --> 3:28:20.840]  the Clintons and from way back from the start of the 1970s. So I've been following this
[3:28:20.840 --> 3:28:21.920]  for a while.
[3:28:21.920 --> 3:28:25.280]  Patty, you sound like a really smart person. Can we get your name and number? Maybe call
[3:28:25.280 --> 3:28:27.240]  you back tomorrow and we take calls?
[3:28:27.240 --> 3:28:29.240]  Sure. No problem.
[3:28:29.240 --> 3:28:32.320]  Because I've got to say it all to the callers. I got Gerald Salente waiting the wings. I
[3:28:32.320 --> 3:28:36.120]  want everybody has to say he's taken over. Everybody here, get their number. I'm going
[3:28:36.120 --> 3:28:39.720]  to cover this again, start of the show tomorrow. I promise you, don't let me forget tomorrow.
[3:28:39.720 --> 3:28:42.880]  We're going to call all these folks back that want to call back on tomorrow. And we got
[3:28:42.880 --> 3:28:46.640]  Gerald Salente taken over right now. He's got a lot to say about all this. We'll get his

[3:30:31.920 --> 3:30:36.360]  Super high quality, winter sun. You don't have sun during the winter. Sun helps your
[3:30:36.360 --> 3:30:41.160]  body produce the vitamin D3. That's why people get so sick. That's the main reason. Well,
[3:30:41.160 --> 3:30:44.840]  you can supplement with this under the tongue at higher absorption. It's amazing. All three

[3:31:05.160 --> 3:31:10.400]  in the spring that people aren't getting sunlight so your body can't produce the vitamin
[3:31:10.400 --> 3:31:16.120]  D it needs. And then that's the main reason people succumb to things like influenza and
[3:31:16.120 --> 3:31:20.680]  other deadly viruses that are wreaking havoc out there. It's on record that you've got
[3:31:20.680 --> 3:31:26.440]  to have this to live, not just to defend against these viruses. So right now we have winter

[3:31:30.960 --> 3:31:38.480]  winter and spring. I'm going to let it sell out at the sales price of 40% off $23. Despite
[3:31:38.480 --> 3:31:43.080]  the fact that I could sell it at full price because I want you to get it and I want to

[3:31:54.240 --> 3:31:59.160]  2020. World governments out in the open. We've got the predicted mass pandemics and they're
[3:31:59.160 --> 3:32:04.160]  calling for global government as the answer. And we've got massive huge censorship taking
[3:32:04.160 --> 3:32:10.600]  place. It's coordinated by big tech and banks against people that promote America and guns
[3:32:10.600 --> 3:32:16.480]  and freedom and Jesus and the family and the protection of the unborn. Wow. Yes. Now we
[3:32:16.480 --> 3:32:20.720]  know we're right. The new world order is real. Satanism is real. The pedophile a leader
[3:32:20.720 --> 3:32:24.920]  real. But we're real as well and we love God and we're standing up and saying no. But I
[3:32:24.920 --> 3:32:29.600]  just want to make the point here one month into 2020 that we have never been in Kansas.
[3:32:29.600 --> 3:32:34.440]  We have never been in some small, ill place that didn't matter. Everything we do, every
[3:32:34.440 --> 3:32:39.080]  decision we make governs the future of our species and everything we've gone through
[3:32:39.080 --> 3:32:41.840]  and everything we're going to go through. So it's an incredible town to be alive. I'm
[3:32:41.840 --> 3:32:46.240]  going to thank you all for being aware and being involved. But just remember your action
[3:32:46.240 --> 3:32:51.680]  now via prayer, word of mouth and financial support of M4store dot com is critical. So
[3:32:51.680 --> 3:33:21.480]  please take action. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[3:33:21.480 --> 3:33:31.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show with Gerald Salente. Hello, hello. Great being
[3:33:31.680 --> 3:33:40.040]  on the Alex Jones show. What's going on? What's going on? The Corona virus. Goodbye,
[3:33:40.040 --> 3:33:48.040]  Rosie, Queen Corona. Oh, wow, this is big. How big is it? Some 60, 80 people died already.
[3:33:48.040 --> 3:33:56.240]  60, 80 people died already. Each year, 1.35 million people are killed on roadways around
[3:33:56.240 --> 3:34:02.000]  the world. Yeah, they're making a big thing out of this. Now they're comparing it to the
[3:34:02.000 --> 3:34:11.560]  SARS virus. So here's from the New York Times, the toilet paper record. They go on to say
[3:34:11.560 --> 3:34:18.560]  that the government blah, blah, blah, blah, ominous similarities with the outbreak of SARS
[3:34:18.560 --> 3:34:27.400]  or severe acute respiratory syndrome in late 2002. You know how many people killed from
[3:34:27.400 --> 3:34:44.920]  this? 800 people. 800 people. It's nothing. In a world of what? 7.7 billion people? They're
[3:34:44.920 --> 3:34:50.960]  making this a big deal. And they're saying this is why the equity markets are down on
[3:34:50.960 --> 3:34:57.720]  the air now, down almost 400 points. It's not why the equity markets are down. The equity
[3:34:57.720 --> 3:35:04.760]  markets are going into some kind of correction. They've been flying up so long, they get adjusted.
[3:35:04.760 --> 3:35:11.320]  But they're blaming this thing in a much bigger, I believe, crisis than it is. And you know,
[3:35:11.320 --> 3:35:18.600]  one of the earlier callers I heard mention about the swine flu has wiped out some 60
[3:35:18.600 --> 3:35:27.080]  percent of the pig population in China. And that's spreading around the world as well now.
[3:35:27.080 --> 3:35:33.160]  I mean, that's a lot. I mean, all the pigs that are dead, they compare that swine flu
[3:35:33.160 --> 3:35:39.000]  to coronavirus. And there's no comparison at all. And they're saying that one of the
[3:35:39.000 --> 3:35:48.120]  ways that this is transmitted from animals to humans, hey, how about all those poisoned
[3:35:48.120 --> 3:35:56.680]  pigs? Could there be a population, a connection between those two? Because they do eat a lot
[3:35:56.680 --> 3:36:05.280]  of pork over there in China. And, you know, as they mentioned in these different places,
[3:36:05.280 --> 3:36:13.080]  they have live animals. So could it be a transporting of these diseases? And again, to me, these
[3:36:13.080 --> 3:36:20.920]  diseases come about through big agriculture, where you have these huge firms that are raising
[3:36:20.920 --> 3:36:32.920]  millions of animals, whether it's pork or chicken or beef or whatever. So could there
[3:36:32.920 --> 3:36:40.240]  be a connection between all of the fake food that they give these animals, all the injections
[3:36:40.240 --> 3:36:47.360]  that they shove into them? I won't eat. I don't eat shrimps anymore, you know, because
[3:36:47.360 --> 3:36:54.400]  I know most of them are farmed. So I don't eat farm food. I mean, I like real farm food,
[3:36:54.400 --> 3:37:00.320]  but not fish farms because they do everything they can to keep these things alive. They
[3:37:00.320 --> 3:37:06.400]  don't care how healthy they are. They just want to sell them. So maybe these diseases
[3:37:06.400 --> 3:37:16.080]  are being spread because of big ag that's taken over the world. You know, we may be
[3:37:16.080 --> 3:37:24.080]  in the beginning of the new black plague, and it's not only going to come from this.
[3:37:24.080 --> 3:37:35.480]  It's all that high-tech heroin that people addicted to their handhelds. And now the 5G
[3:37:35.480 --> 3:37:43.240]  cell towers are going to be on telephone poles, lamp posts, rooftops near your house,
[3:37:43.240 --> 3:37:49.560]  across the street, up the street, down the street. Radio frequency radiation is real.
[3:37:49.560 --> 3:38:00.600]  The studies come out. They've forgotten about. So to me, this coronavirus could be very deadly,
[3:38:00.600 --> 3:38:11.840]  but again, the numbers are way inflating reality. And very important to note that the people
[3:38:11.840 --> 3:38:20.680]  that are dying are mostly elderly people, or I shouldn't say elderly, chronically ill
[3:38:20.680 --> 3:38:31.120]  people. That's a fact. So you read about what the symptoms are. You got a cough. So it's
[3:38:31.120 --> 3:38:39.800]  true. Running nose. Yeah, it's like a bad flu. And it hits those that are chronically
[3:38:39.800 --> 3:38:51.160]  ill the worst. But again, when they commit, when they compare this to the SARS virus,
[3:38:51.160 --> 3:38:59.400]  and only 800 people were killed, how could they make that a big deal? That's not a lot
[3:38:59.400 --> 3:39:05.040]  of people. That's like they do with this measles stuff. You know, when I was a kid, people
[3:39:05.040 --> 3:39:13.800]  got meat. He's got measles, chickenpox and mumps. It's some die. Yeah, very few. And
[3:39:13.800 --> 3:39:25.520]  a whole population. But now you got to get injected. And these arrogant people, big farmer
[3:39:25.520 --> 3:39:36.160]  pay off lousy little boys and girls called doctors to get paid by big farmer to tell
[3:39:36.160 --> 3:39:43.720]  us what they want us to tell us. It's perfectly, perfectly fine to have a child come out of
[3:39:43.720 --> 3:39:52.120]  a mother's womb and start injecting it in with a bunch of chemicals. Yeah, and we have
[3:39:52.120 --> 3:39:58.800]  facts and proof that the combination of these chemicals all ended up in divided by 12 and
[3:39:58.800 --> 3:40:06.160]  multiplied by 17 is just fine. You know, save it. You know, they stopped it from happening
[3:40:06.160 --> 3:40:16.280]  over here in in Jersey across the river where the people protested against forcing them to
[3:40:16.280 --> 3:40:21.800]  get vaccinated in New York with the low lives that we got over here. They're forcing it
[3:40:21.800 --> 3:40:33.160]  through. So you can't get a religious exemption or doctors. You know, when I was a kid, you
[3:40:33.160 --> 3:40:41.640]  know, autism. Nobody had autism with a crazy kids, a couple, you know, that couldn't function,
[3:40:41.640 --> 3:40:49.960]  but not like now. I have a I have a second cousin, two of them, both children born at
[3:40:49.960 --> 3:40:57.960]  the same time. Severe autism. And I'm a baby boom. I'm the first of the boomers, man. You
[3:40:57.960 --> 3:41:03.040]  know, they call the baby boomers. The war was over. World War Two and guys wanted to
[3:41:03.040 --> 3:41:09.360]  come on and have a good time with their ladies. So baby is boomed. I may get arrested for
[3:41:09.360 --> 3:41:17.640]  that and get, you know, sensing. So anyway, there were a lot of kids in my class. We didn't
[3:41:17.640 --> 3:41:24.760]  have this kind of thing. Just like you don't have. We didn't have obesity like we have
[3:41:24.760 --> 3:41:37.000]  it now. Think about it. Think about it. People eat junk food. They swallow junk news. And
[3:41:37.000 --> 3:41:44.960]  they're dumbed down in school with junk information. Can't understand why society is going down
[3:41:44.960 --> 3:41:54.960]  so low. I mean, just think about it. The teachers, when I was a kid, had us hiding under
[3:41:54.960 --> 3:42:01.560]  a desk in case an atom bomb went off. And don't look at the flash. Don't look at the
[3:42:01.560 --> 3:42:10.880]  flash. And they're doing the same thing now. Having these kids all gone through these drills
[3:42:10.880 --> 3:42:15.680]  in case somebody comes in and tries to kill. Worthless, worthless. But they put fear into
[3:42:15.680 --> 3:42:28.120]  you. And that's what this is about. Fear and hysteria. That's what they sell. It's only
[3:42:28.120 --> 3:42:35.080]  going to get worse. So it's going on in the markets today is very important because we
[3:42:35.080 --> 3:42:44.440]  also saw oil prices go down here under now. Sixty dollars a barrel. What does that mean?
[3:42:44.440 --> 3:42:51.760]  A lot. And we we come back and tell you what it means and what's next. See you in a few.
[3:42:51.760 --> 3:42:55.560]  It's no secret that our daily lives are becoming more stressful. No matter what side of the

[3:43:58.120 --> 3:44:01.920]  victory over the globalist and these devil worship and child molesters, and you want
[3:44:01.920 --> 3:44:05.640]  them off your back and off your children's back, and you know what? I'm the same way,

[3:44:09.960 --> 3:44:16.480]  time and time again when it's clutch time to focus the people on taking action against
[3:44:16.480 --> 3:44:22.160]  the globalist, because I'm committed to a future for humanity, and I know you are as
[3:44:22.160 --> 3:44:26.800]  well. So thank you in 2019 for standing with us, because you are the Info War, and I want
[3:44:26.800 --> 3:44:31.440]  to thank you for committing to stand with us in 2020 however you can. For the bottom
[3:44:31.440 --> 3:44:35.600]  of my heart, for my family, and for the great crew at InfoWars, I want to thank you all
[3:44:35.600 --> 3:44:40.960]  because you are the Info War, and you know that's not just words, that's reality. You
[3:44:40.960 --> 3:44:48.960]  have made history. We have made history together. InfoWars.com only has power because of you,
[3:44:48.960 --> 3:44:56.640]  I suggest you use it. I've got to really hand it to the listeners and viewers from InfoWars.
[3:44:56.640 --> 3:45:02.320]  Your support and your help in rebooting Americana is a challenge to the globalist system of
[3:45:02.320 --> 3:45:07.360]  corporate tyranny has really caught hold, not just here in the U.S. but worldwide, and
[3:45:07.360 --> 3:45:12.880]  President Trump's fearlessness when it comes to promoting Americana and basic liberty is
[3:45:12.880 --> 3:45:18.280]  amazing as well. He's still lacking on the big tech censorship, taking action against
[3:45:18.280 --> 3:45:22.360]  that in some other areas, but trying to end the wars, boosting our economy, speaking out
[3:45:22.360 --> 3:45:27.800]  against communist China. Trump's been doing an amazing job, but now more than ever, we
[3:45:27.800 --> 3:45:33.480]  really have to realize that we're being targeted because we are effective, and the globalists
[3:45:33.480 --> 3:45:38.640]  are beginning to lose their war against humanity in a big way, and so we're going to see some
[3:45:38.640 --> 3:45:43.960]  major fireworks out of them, but it's critical to not let ourselves get down when we see
[3:45:43.960 --> 3:45:49.200]  all the poison they spray at us. That's an attempt to moralize us. We've got to remember
[3:45:49.200 --> 3:45:55.400]  that and stay focused and stay happy. If you understand why the globalist, why the servants
[3:45:55.400 --> 3:46:01.880]  of Satan hate InfoWars, it's because we're awake, we're alive, we're passionate, and
[3:46:01.880 --> 3:46:07.480]  we're not giving up. That's why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the New
[3:46:07.480 --> 3:46:12.520]  World Order's plans to not get down when they attack us and they persecute us and they
[3:46:12.520 --> 3:46:18.400]  lie about us. That's what we should expect because we are hurting these scumbags. The
[3:46:18.400 --> 3:46:22.400]  globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side, and they do what they do
[3:46:22.400 --> 3:46:28.360]  because they're slaves, because they are eternally driven to try to suppress and dominate and
[3:46:28.360 --> 3:46:34.480]  destroy the innocent. It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the wolves, but
[3:46:34.480 --> 3:46:41.280]  the sheepdogs, to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that we
[3:46:41.280 --> 3:46:48.280]  are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God,
[3:46:48.280 --> 3:46:55.360]  and that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge.
[3:46:55.360 --> 3:47:17.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Waging war on corruption, it's Gerald Salente.
[3:47:17.840 --> 3:47:27.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Great thing on the Alex Jones show. Remember,
[3:47:27.720 --> 3:47:33.960]  please do all you can to support Alex Jones because you know what one of our top trends
[3:47:33.960 --> 3:47:44.800]  for 2018 was? Censorship 2018. And boy, as it happened in 2019 and 2020. So, info wars,
[3:47:44.800 --> 3:47:52.080]  life selects storeable food. With the rise of coronavirus, trouble brewing constantly
[3:47:52.080 --> 3:47:57.560]  overseas and more danger is constantly growing overseas. That's why it's so important to
[3:47:57.560 --> 3:48:03.960]  make sure that you have the storeable food that you need to prepare today with amounts
[3:48:03.960 --> 3:48:11.200]  ranging from three days to a whole year. Our storeable food selection can make sure you're
[3:48:11.200 --> 3:48:17.360]  not a victim of circumstances. You know, one of the things I say, prepare for the worst.
[3:48:17.360 --> 3:48:26.000]  If the worst doesn't happen, you lost nothing. If the worst happens and you didn't prepare,
[3:48:26.000 --> 3:48:32.120]  you could lose everything. And it's not bigger than the coronavirus because these foods are
[3:48:32.120 --> 3:48:37.680]  great. These emergency survival foods. I mean, just look at them. You know, the manufacturers
[3:48:37.680 --> 3:48:43.120]  having difficulty keeping up with the current spike. So many people want these. So as soon
[3:48:43.120 --> 3:48:48.440]  as it comes off the line, it's being shipped out. So secure your orders today. You know,
[3:48:48.440 --> 3:48:54.120]  one of my top trends this year is off with their heads because the rich are also hiding
[3:48:54.120 --> 3:48:58.680]  or having places where they're going to hide with things get really bad and they're storing
[3:48:58.680 --> 3:49:04.080]  up on stuff too. So do what you can support info wars. And of course, I do as well with
[3:49:04.080 --> 3:49:12.120]  my super male vitality keeps me going, rocking in a reel and bopping and rolling. Yep. So
[3:49:12.120 --> 3:49:17.640]  do what you can. Again, talking about coronavirus and you know, people talking about climate
[3:49:17.640 --> 3:49:20.680]  change. They forget about this climate. I don't want to hear about this. We're going
[3:49:20.680 --> 3:49:29.280]  to be dead before that happens. The way they're poisoning us. Yeah. U.S. drinking water widely
[3:49:29.280 --> 3:49:36.360]  contaminated with forever chemicals is report from Reuters. You're not getting this from
[3:49:36.360 --> 3:49:42.520]  a left wing group. And by the way, we're also going to want to buy those info or water filters
[3:49:42.520 --> 3:49:47.520]  because the facts are all here. And we're talking about investing a little bit of money
[3:49:47.520 --> 3:49:54.760]  to help save your life so you don't go down needlessly by drinking poison. The contamination
[3:49:54.760 --> 3:50:01.080]  of U.S. drinking water with manufacturing made quote for ever chemicals is far worse
[3:50:01.080 --> 3:50:07.760]  than previously estimated with some of the highest levels found in Miami, Philadelphia
[3:50:07.760 --> 3:50:20.440]  and New Orleans. Talking about 110 million people. 110 million people. Oh, watch out
[3:50:20.440 --> 3:50:28.320]  for coronavirus. Okay, to drink that poison water. It's fine. Yeah, you remember Obama
[3:50:28.320 --> 3:50:34.920]  and Flint, Michigan crisis. What a crisis happened. We're going to fix this folks. Yeah,
[3:50:34.920 --> 3:50:41.560]  he gave them the folks all right. Still haven't done anything. Nothing. So remember, do what
[3:50:41.560 --> 3:50:47.840]  you can. This thing is serious. You know, to make sure your ward is filtered. And this
[3:50:47.840 --> 3:50:54.360]  is on and then again, the lines that they use far worse than previously estimated. They're
[3:50:54.360 --> 3:51:02.840]  always lying to us. You name it, they're lying. So this is really serious. So do what you
[3:51:02.840 --> 3:51:08.480]  can to eat healthy, stay healthy, stay on top of the game by getting in the best shape
[3:51:08.480 --> 3:51:15.840]  you can physically, spiritually and emotionally because this thing's going down. The chemicals
[3:51:15.840 --> 3:51:22.800]  are used in products like Teflon and scotch guard and in fighter fighting foam. We have
[3:51:22.800 --> 3:51:27.800]  Newburgh airport over here. Stuart Air Force Base. It used to be an Air Force Base. So
[3:51:27.800 --> 3:51:36.760]  to do all this training with this foam, it'll water over there is all polluted. So that's
[3:51:36.760 --> 3:51:43.080]  what you're looking at. So you want to stay healthy. And the way you can do it is with
[3:51:43.080 --> 3:51:47.000]  a lot of these products. I want to move on to the economy. Well, before I do that and
[3:51:47.000 --> 3:51:55.600]  tell you how they keep lying to us, USA Air Force playing crashes in central Afghanistan.
[3:51:55.600 --> 3:52:00.440]  And they go on to say the United States, the chief of staff for the USA Air Force General
[3:52:00.440 --> 3:52:07.240]  David Goldfein confirmed. We don't know the status of the crew. Here's another thing I'll
[3:52:07.240 --> 3:52:11.480]  share with you. Every time I've been through this, which unfortunately has been a number
[3:52:11.480 --> 3:52:16.520]  of times, the first reports are always wrong, always wrong. So we have to make sure that
[3:52:16.520 --> 3:52:24.160]  we have the facts right. And as soon as we have those facts, I promise you, you will
[3:52:24.160 --> 3:52:31.800]  we will get them to you. You know, that is we get nothing. Speaking to reporters, a Pentagon
[3:52:31.800 --> 3:52:37.720]  brief press briefing, Secretary of Defense Mark Esper said today that he was quote aware
[3:52:37.720 --> 3:52:45.960]  of the situation, nothing to report at the time. And from the U. S. Afghanistan spokesman
[3:52:45.960 --> 3:52:51.760]  Sonny Leggett, he said in a statement that the cause of the crash was under investigation.
[3:52:51.760 --> 3:52:57.240]  And there was no identification. The crash was caused by enemy fire. I mentioned this
[3:52:57.240 --> 3:53:03.720]  because out of the news totally gone. Long time forgotten because it happened so long
[3:53:03.720 --> 3:53:12.800]  ago, about a month ago. The Afghan papers came out. The Afghan papers to tell us how
[3:53:12.800 --> 3:53:22.440]  the Pentagon, how the White House, how Congress has been lying to us continually about what's
[3:53:22.440 --> 3:53:30.360]  going on in Afghanistan to keep us believing that they've been making progress when it's
[3:53:30.360 --> 3:53:39.440]  only been going downhill and stealing all our money for the military industrial complex.
[3:53:39.440 --> 3:53:45.720]  They keep slaughtering people around the world. Hey, could you imagine if that money went
[3:53:45.720 --> 3:53:54.560]  to clean water? Get real. So lengthy. We got people to kill. Yeah. Can you imagine if
[3:53:54.560 --> 3:54:02.160]  this water was clean and we didn't have these problems because that's what we put our energy
[3:54:02.160 --> 3:54:08.640]  rather than the some six trillion dollars, eight trillion dollars spent so far on terror.
[3:54:08.640 --> 3:54:20.120]  And what a terrible mess it is. Iraq, Yemen, Syria, one place after another, Afghanistan.
[3:54:20.120 --> 3:54:29.920]  And now you see what's going on with one country after another, Lebanon. One of my top trends
[3:54:29.920 --> 3:54:34.080]  is the New World Disorder. That's the headline of the last Trends Journal. This thing's out
[3:54:34.080 --> 3:54:39.680]  of hand. People are taken to the streets. You saw that new study that came out from the
[3:54:39.680 --> 3:54:47.240]  OZFAM report. We got 26 people, got more dough than half the world's population. You got
[3:54:47.240 --> 3:54:54.280]  a couple of. Could you imagine Bloomberg, B.S. Bloomberg stop and frisk? Yeah, the cops
[3:54:54.280 --> 3:55:00.120]  will stop you if your color is too dark and they don't like the way you look under him.
[3:55:00.120 --> 3:55:07.360]  Stop. You talk about freedom, constitutional, bill of rights taken away by Bloomberg, the
[3:55:07.360 --> 3:55:13.800]  blowhard who supported what he did right up until he announced he was running for election
[3:55:13.800 --> 3:55:21.280]  on the demo craps. He was fine with it. Anyway, he spent already over two hundred and twenty
[3:55:21.280 --> 3:55:29.800]  million dollars on TV and other ads. Two hundred and twenty million dollars. Could you imagine
[3:55:29.800 --> 3:55:35.560]  if they gave two hundred and twenty million dollars to occupy peace? The only peace movement
[3:55:35.560 --> 3:55:39.400]  in the world with an action plan to bring home the troops, secure the homeland, put the
[3:55:39.400 --> 3:55:44.200]  troops to rebuild our rodent infrastructure, force these little slimers in Congress to
[3:55:44.200 --> 3:55:50.040]  vote to go to war. Article one clause eight of the Constitution, which they have not done
[3:55:50.040 --> 3:55:54.360]  since World War Two, and have a referendum on each state ballot where we the people will
[3:55:54.360 --> 3:56:01.880]  tell them how to vote. Do you imagine if these billionaires put their money into peace? Grow
[3:56:01.880 --> 3:56:08.920]  up, Solenti. We got money to steal and people to cheat. Oh, yeah, you saw that guy. It made
[3:56:08.920 --> 3:56:19.480]  a big deal out of it. Wells Fargo X CEO is banned for life. Stomp. His name is Stomp.
[3:56:19.480 --> 3:56:24.800]  Agrees not to work in industry again and has fined seventeen point five million dollars
[3:56:24.800 --> 3:56:32.320]  over fake accounts that screwed millions of people at a billions of dollars. The word
[3:56:32.320 --> 3:56:44.080]  justice in America. Forget about it. They spell it wrong. It's just us J. U. S. T. U. S.
[3:56:44.080 --> 3:56:50.960]  Take off the I. C. E. Because the big how many how many felony charges does J. P. Morgan
[3:56:50.960 --> 3:56:57.240]  Chase have against them? Was it four three or four? I think there's a new one that just
[3:56:57.240 --> 3:57:04.320]  came out felony charges. Hey, where were you? You didn't have your signal light on. Get
[3:57:04.320 --> 3:57:08.600]  out of the car. Stand on your head. Repeat the alphabet backwards and they get tough
[3:57:08.600 --> 3:57:13.200]  with you and take you to jail and you could stick their fingers up. You know what? Hey,
[3:57:13.200 --> 3:57:28.160]  did Jamie Diamond make last year? Huh? Thirty one million dollars. Thirty one million dollars.
[3:57:28.160 --> 3:57:37.920]  But that's for the big guys. They get a free ride. So thank you very much for tuning in
[3:57:37.920 --> 3:57:44.640]  and we'll see you very soon.
