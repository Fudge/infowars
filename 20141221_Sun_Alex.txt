[00:00.000 --> 00:05.120]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones
[00:14.840 --> 00:21.600]  I called CDC not long ago and said how many active cases are being monitored in the United States of Ebola and they said
[00:22.400 --> 00:25.520]  1,400 I said where is that on your website these updates?
[00:25.520 --> 00:30.600]  They said we're not putting it on the web. So I think there is an effort to control the message and to tamp it down
[00:31.040 --> 00:35.760]  This is public information. We have a right to and I think the media should not hype it but cover it
[00:36.600 --> 00:38.680]  Cheryl Atkinson
[00:38.680 --> 00:41.880]  That's a respective reporter investigative journalist at Fox News
[00:43.160 --> 00:48.920]  We had a top Forbes writer that writes their medical news saying they were at the meeting
[00:49.240 --> 00:51.680]  Months ago where they said we're gonna cover up. What's going on with Ebola?
[00:51.680 --> 00:54.800]  I've had a medical doctor on by name
[00:56.720 --> 01:01.640]  Saying that the medical doctors in these hospitals and we named the hospital the Harry Truman Center in Missouri and
[01:03.480 --> 01:08.500]  That they were being told that they were Ebola cases then I talked to a bunch of other doctors off record
[01:10.000 --> 01:12.000]  One doctor I know personally
[01:13.120 --> 01:16.440]  That runs a chain of hospitals in a major Texas City
[01:16.440 --> 01:24.920]  One of the cities that has an NFL team and there's a blue star on their helmets
[01:26.200 --> 01:31.640]  Didn't tell me not to say the city. I've just gone ahead and said it's up at the DFW area and now they're scared
[01:31.640 --> 01:35.160]  We just talked to him again a week ago. He comes down to Austin sometimes
[01:37.200 --> 01:39.480]  We talked on the phone last week he's scared
[01:39.480 --> 01:47.720]  Because it's definitely Ebola and it's being covered up and they think they're liable for taking part in this
[01:51.480 --> 01:54.640]  Now I've got all this important news, but right there
[01:56.640 --> 02:00.480]  Now Fox News investigative journalist is saying they're covering up
[02:02.200 --> 02:04.200]  Headlines from Breitbart
[02:04.200 --> 02:13.400]  Atkinson CDC hiding numbers of possible Ebola cases in US. That's exactly what info wars calm had that headline
[02:14.320 --> 02:16.320]  two months ago
[02:17.040 --> 02:22.920]  Here's one of our headlines we wrote scores of stories on the subject Obama caught ordering press to cover up Ebola
[02:24.400 --> 02:29.840]  Pharmacologist reveals how press has bowed to government demand to keep Americans in the dark
[02:29.840 --> 02:31.840]  Only
[02:33.760 --> 02:43.680]  Drudge report comm linked to our story and then I guess that force yahoo to but no national coverage not Fox not CNN and see as bad as Fox is
[02:44.680 --> 02:48.760]  That's the channel where they'll talk about our government growing opium in Afghanistan
[02:48.760 --> 02:52.120]  And that's the channel where they'll talk about they may be covering up Ebola
[02:53.760 --> 02:56.040]  It's it's just on a scale of things
[02:56.040 --> 03:04.800]  It's it's much better than CNN or MSNBC and remember they let Bill O'Reilly have a show about women being cyber-stocked in sex crimes
[03:04.800 --> 03:11.040]  And then just cut to a clip of me as a non sequitur with no description why screaming
[03:13.360 --> 03:15.200]  So they're bad
[03:15.200 --> 03:20.000]  Some of their people are bad, but they've got good people over there like judge Andrew DePaul autonome
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  And Lou Dobbs and people like that. So that's all I'm saying is at least they're not openly anti-god on fox news
[03:26.200 --> 03:30.920]  Yeah, there's the article with the video Bill O'Reilly smears Alex Jones and hate speech rent
[03:32.560 --> 03:37.400]  He goes, yeah, there's all these sex crimes going on the internet. They just cut to me screaming about the police
[03:38.400 --> 03:40.400]  Had nothing to do
[03:40.400 --> 03:44.920]  With women and I've never been charged with anything never been a I mean, it's just insane
[03:46.640 --> 03:48.640]  Only thing works is
[03:48.640 --> 03:55.200]  Only thing worse is MSNBC saying I influenced the Boston bombers with no proof and then I want cops dead
[03:57.320 --> 03:59.720]  And I don't mean to make the show about me
[03:59.720 --> 04:01.720]  It's just that if they can do this to me
[04:02.120 --> 04:07.280]  Or if they can blame the next Oklahoma City on, you know, who or Rush Limbaugh, we all fall
[04:09.360 --> 04:14.640]  If they can take down a drugs report like the White House has been caught saying they want to the media matters
[04:14.640 --> 04:16.680]  So they just gave a big award the White House did this week
[04:16.680 --> 04:23.960]  They can get me and you know who else they can get they can get your free speech because you take anybody's rights away
[04:24.640 --> 04:28.640]  They can take everybody's rights away when they try to bring down big organizations
[04:29.080 --> 04:33.880]  Let's try to bring down people that have tens of millions of listeners. You better believe that's an attack on your rights
[04:34.000 --> 04:40.880]  Not just the person under attack. All right, we've got the cops executed in New York in Brooklyn. We're gonna break that down
[04:40.880 --> 04:47.960]  We've got Team America also being removed from theaters like the Alamo draft house here in Austin and Dallas
[04:48.240 --> 04:50.240]  not just the
[04:51.040 --> 04:53.800]  New movie about Kim Jong-un the interview
[04:54.520 --> 04:56.640]  It's a big broadcast stay with us

[06:05.000 --> 06:06.760]  Aborted babies in
[06:06.760 --> 06:09.240]  generated to eat UK hospitals
[06:10.360 --> 06:18.000]  Silent green ladies and gentlemen is made out of people but now children are literally being passed through the furnace in
[06:18.000 --> 06:19.920]  order to fuel
[06:19.920 --> 06:25.520]  Hospitals in the UK. They're being sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity
[06:30.240 --> 06:37.120]  The powdered flesh from dead babies some people believe they can cure disease because of its enormous popularity
[06:37.960 --> 06:39.960]  Soil and green is in short supply
[06:40.480 --> 06:46.600]  Remember Tuesday is soil and green day the supply of soil and green has been exhausted
[06:46.600 --> 06:48.600]  You must evacuate the area
[06:51.960 --> 06:53.240]  That the
[06:53.240 --> 06:58.320]  Careholders of PepsiCo big builder bird group company are not allowed to know
[06:59.520 --> 07:03.000]  What they're using the baby parts for for in the flavoring, but we already know
[07:03.400 --> 07:07.040]  So enjoy the flavor. We're gonna get the real solution
[07:07.040 --> 07:13.320]  Which is going to be a combination of death panels and and sales taxes. I'm consistently pro-death. I'm for assisted suicide
[07:13.320 --> 07:19.920]  I'm for regulars. No, I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life
[07:19.920 --> 07:25.520]  For that patient would it be better not to lay off the those ten teachers and
[07:26.120 --> 07:30.040]  To make that trade-off and medical costs, but that's called the death panel
[07:30.560 --> 07:35.560]  And you're not supposed to have that discussion. They told me to say that they were sorry
[07:35.560 --> 07:42.560]  But that you had become unreliable
[07:46.560 --> 07:52.080]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in any kind of society that would do this to its children
[07:52.160 --> 07:56.320]  Will do it to its senior citizens. It will do it to its dissidents
[07:56.720 --> 08:03.680]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police on its army on its prison guards on the quiz lings and the
[08:03.680 --> 08:08.840]  Collaborators who make that possible. This is nothing, but a suicide cult
[08:08.840 --> 08:25.840]  The scoops are on their way. The scoops are on their way. I repeat the scoops are on their way. You will find out why soylent green means life. You will find out why soylent green means death. We're going to stop them.
[08:25.840 --> 08:40.840]  The next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle for food. You're going to tell them.
[08:43.840 --> 08:47.840]  And that is basically a boil down of
[08:48.840 --> 08:53.840]  Fiction soylent green that came out in the early 70s with Charlton Heston an excellent sci-fi film
[08:53.840 --> 09:01.840]  Integrated in with the current policies the anti-human policies that are being promoted
[09:02.840 --> 09:13.840]  I am your host Alex Jones. We're live. It is Sunday the 21st day of December 2014
[09:13.840 --> 09:25.840]  And I didn't tell the crew this but why don't we dig up some of the classical Beethoven or Mozart Christmas cannons
[09:26.840 --> 09:35.840]  And have a bit of that today into the spirit especially because it's so politically incorrect in such a free country all over the United States
[09:35.840 --> 09:43.840]  I have a stack of articles we'll be hitting in the second hour colleges high schools elementary schools are saying don't hand out Christmas cards
[09:44.840 --> 09:52.840]  Don't say Merry Christmas and whatever you do don't say Jesus Christ. Let me explain something on a college or a public school you can read the Bible at lunch
[09:53.840 --> 10:02.840]  You can give anybody Christmas cards you want as long as they're not obscene you could give them cards that weren't Christmas cards you could give them copies of the Bill of Rights
[10:02.840 --> 10:11.840]  It's your free association and Christmas trees are being banned in cities all over the country. I'm sick of it
[10:12.840 --> 10:22.840]  Plus a Christmas tree is not even really a Christian symbol they've dug up Christmas trees and 20,000 year old caves in Germany and France
[10:22.840 --> 10:35.840]  They hauled the trees in for the winter equinox which is today and they put evergreens which they thought were magic because they lived during the cold weather when the other trees lost their leaves
[10:36.840 --> 10:44.840]  And they would decorate them with ornaments and worship them many cultures worship trees it's in the Bible
[10:44.840 --> 10:52.840]  You know saying people that go out in the groves and worship the trees look out for them but the point is that I love Christmas trees
[10:53.840 --> 11:02.840]  Now it's a Christian symbol expropriated I'm not getting into that it's just that the pagans and people are always at the vanguard
[11:03.840 --> 11:10.840]  The Wiccans every time I turn around are filing lawsuits and stuff saying get rid of Christmas trees listen dummies
[11:10.840 --> 11:13.840]  The Christmas tree is your symbol
[11:16.840 --> 11:24.840]  I mean it's just over the top how ignorant people are but it doesn't matter it's part of western culture in the Netherlands
[11:25.840 --> 11:35.840]  They're trying to ban the black Peters which for over 800 years they've had before transatlantic slavery before one black slavery
[11:35.840 --> 11:43.840]  But people never even seen an African it was mythical that Santa Claus had black elves and white elves it was neat
[11:44.840 --> 11:50.840]  Nothing to do with putting black people down they're trying to ban the black Peters what it's called
[11:52.840 --> 11:58.840]  It's just getting ridiculous ladies and gentlemen
[11:58.840 --> 12:12.840]  Absolutely ridiculous to where remember last year the city of Seattle put out a release to all their agencies police you name it saying do not have brown bag days
[12:13.840 --> 12:25.840]  Where they'll have in-service training everybody has that in in professions and then you come and they say brown bag provided they were telling all the HR departments do not say the department will provide a brown bag lunch
[12:25.840 --> 12:29.840]  Everybody knows that means an apple chips and a ham sandwich or a chicken sandwich
[12:30.840 --> 12:43.840]  There it is KOMO news city officials urge ban on politically offensive language this is mental illness and it goes on to say the word brown bag and citizen is offensive
[12:43.840 --> 12:55.840]  Oh I forgot that part of it because if you say citizen that makes a non-citizen feel bad so now just everybody's a citizen and gets everything free
[12:56.840 --> 13:03.840]  Meanwhile all of us are losing our basic freedoms our bill of rights our constitution and all of us have our first amendment under attack and should be coming together against it
[13:03.840 --> 13:18.840]  Now I have been predicting the last three years intensely because I could see the drumbeat on CNN MSNBC and by the White House and by Mother Jones and just all the other auxiliaries of creating racial obsession and infighting and divide and conquer
[13:19.840 --> 13:28.840]  But then back in February of this year I issued an emergency alert before the brown case before any of these cases
[13:28.840 --> 13:36.840]  In fact there's another report flashback U.S. Army training to fight black Americans that's from November
[13:37.840 --> 13:40.840]  Originally July 17th we flashbacked it
[13:41.840 --> 13:49.840]  I can see a rollout just like Poland could see for six months the Nazis massing on their border in 1940
[13:49.840 --> 13:57.840]  And they were saying they were about to attack us and the Germans would say you're paranoid you're conspiracy theorist
[13:58.840 --> 14:12.840]  I can see the buildup I can see the preparation to try to create racial division and then race war but also play the populations off against the police which will then cause the police to become more paranoid and more paramilitary
[14:12.840 --> 14:20.840]  And go under federal control because they'll be indicted if they engage in any paramilitary activity unless they're under federal auspices
[14:21.840 --> 14:30.840]  Just like the feds and CNN demonized asset forfeiture seizure in the last 20 years to get it banned at the state level so the feds can be the only ones that administer it
[14:31.840 --> 14:36.840]  And then they give back up to 85% of the money to the local police that they seize effectively making them federal
[14:36.840 --> 14:52.840]  See how that works? And about three weeks ago Paul Watson did articles showing the Twitter pages and the Facebooks of urban black racist groups and black prison gangs
[14:53.840 --> 15:00.840]  The FBI later actually picked that up and put an alert out to police because the FBI does a good job a lot of the time and they've got good compartments within it
[15:00.840 --> 15:05.840]  But we were the first to point out I'm not bragging I'm saying we know what we're talking about we're going to go over that today
[15:06.840 --> 15:12.840]  That you're going to see as part of the urban protest and it's now in the gangster rap again financed by Hollywood
[15:13.840 --> 15:22.840]  That the way you protest if you're a black urban person who's mad is you go and just shoot a random cop at a donut shop or in their patrol car
[15:22.840 --> 15:30.840]  And of course we were then attacked by media matters openly run by the White House the head of it was given a presidential award last week
[15:32.840 --> 15:37.840]  Saying we're crazy making this up no cops are going to have their heads blown off well it just happened yesterday
[15:40.840 --> 15:47.840]  Because they are taking a few bad cases and hyping them to create racial division and certainly there's some problems out there
[15:47.840 --> 15:56.840]  But you don't randomly go kill someone because of their race or a uniform or anything else and it's to get us all at each other's throats
[15:59.840 --> 16:07.840]  As the year is coming to a close we all pause to reflect on what's happened in the past year we take a step back and thank God for what we have
[16:07.840 --> 16:16.840]  I'm David Hall founder of Diamond Gusset Jeans at Diamond Gusset we are celebrating the brush fires of liberty that are spreading across this great nation

[21:20.840 --> 21:30.840]  And the answer is no it's racist it doesn't have to do with snow just like brown bags don't just mean a lunch bag it's code see
[21:30.840 --> 21:42.840]  And that's what mother Jones has come out this December issue and says are you racist science has the answer they hook you up with electrodes show you different images of people and if you don't
[21:42.840 --> 21:53.840]  Want to have sex with someone who you're not attracted to and that they have to be another race then you're a racist see having your own opinion having your own discretion
[21:53.840 --> 22:02.840]  Or your own discrimination is now racist and by discrimination maybe I like vanilla ice cream over chocolate I don't like chocolate over vanilla maybe I like strawberry over mango
[22:02.840 --> 22:14.840]  Doesn't mean I'm racist against mango maybe on average I'm attracted to blondes or brunettes maybe I like really white skin maybe I like tan skin
[22:14.840 --> 22:25.840]  Maybe maybe I like black women maybe I don't maybe I like some black women like I like some white women not I mean it's ridiculous but just I tend to lean towards fill in the blank
[22:25.840 --> 22:38.840]  That's called my opinion I drive a Ford truck not a Chevy but I like Chevy products even though they give money to gun control grips and Ford doesn't so I buy Ford
[22:38.840 --> 22:50.840]  And see I'm going to discriminate against Chevrolet because of their political activities and getting bailouts and I'm going to buy Ford because quite frankly Ford has raised the quality of their products
[22:50.840 --> 22:58.840]  I didn't like Ford back when I was a kid and saw my dad's Ford van breaking down all the time even though it was three years old
[22:58.840 --> 23:07.840]  They want to distract us from all the real issues and what are the real issues we're going to play this clip Obama caught ordering press to cover up Ebola
[23:07.840 --> 23:19.840]  Forbes reported that we broke it down November 6 that Forbes was at a meeting with the head of the CDC and they all agreed before the press conference started to not question apparent Ebola cases
[23:19.840 --> 23:36.840]  And joined hands to be part of the cover up now we've had a medical doctor on I've talked to a bunch off record that are scared in Dallas, Kansas City, St. Louis, Chicago, LA, Atlanta, New York
[23:36.840 --> 23:46.840]  Where there are apparent Ebola cases and they're whisk away and disappeared obviously it's getting worse in Africa they've moved the story out of the news because it started to blow back on Obama
[23:46.840 --> 23:59.840]  And get associated with amnesty and open borders and I was just thinking yesterday on Saturday I was up there doing a special live report on our crew covering protests
[23:59.840 --> 24:09.840]  And spoke in Washington of the sheriff's department getting federal training and saying their main enemy was basically constitutionalist and that's why they have these giant MRAP armored vehicles
[24:09.840 --> 24:22.840]  And I was thinking what am I going to cover tomorrow on the big Sunday show because we're here weekdays 11 to 2 and we have the Sunday show that's very popular 4 to 6 p.m. Central on over 100 affiliates now around the country
[24:22.840 --> 24:32.840]  And I was thinking I want to bring up Ebola and just point out hey you know it's peaking in Africa right now with about a million cases they believe more people are flying in
[24:32.840 --> 24:42.840]  Don't you think they're probably covering it up plus we've been told so by our own sources on record and off record by Forbes it's amazing
[24:42.840 --> 24:58.840]  This is from Fox News this audio and video is up on infowars.com right now if you're a radio listener you go to infowars.com and don't just download the free iPhone app so you can listen once you're outside of MNFM listening areas wherever you go
[24:58.840 --> 25:12.840]  Taking the show with you you can also just go to infowars.com forward slash show and right there weekdays and on the weekend and the special reports we do for special live events you can see what I'm about to play
[25:12.840 --> 25:26.840]  So infowars.com forward slash show I was out with some friends last week and one of them said I love watching your radio show and the other person said you know I don't listen to show a lot but what do you mean you watch his radio show
[25:26.840 --> 25:40.840]  Well that's kind of what people do. This is a Sunday on Fox News channel today media buzz investigative journalist Cheryl Eckerson said the CDC is not putting out the current information on how many potential cases of Ebola
[25:40.840 --> 25:52.840]  They are currently tracking in the United States and see that's the thing they could keep it secret for five months this year that they'd ordered the board patrol to ship the illegals in and give them vouchers by the hundreds of thousands a month
[25:52.840 --> 26:06.840]  The millions total. We had to go down and show it on the border and show the board of patrol doing it and break it nationally. Little infowars that shows how they can have the fix being in
[26:06.840 --> 26:21.840]  But the good news is it's coming out on Forbes and Fox News so see we're vindicated. We told you we had doctor sources and nurse sources medical sources saying this one of them was willing to go on the air with his name a medical director of three hospitals
[26:21.840 --> 26:33.840]  I know the director I'm going to leave it at that of some of the biggest hospitals in Dallas Fort Worth and they said it's guaranteed going on
[26:33.840 --> 26:41.840]  So let me just give you a news flash. I don't know how much Ebola is out there but it's going on and it's being covered up. Let's go to Fox News. Here's a clip
[26:41.840 --> 26:53.840]  I called CDC not long ago and said how many active cases are being monitored in the United States of Ebola and they said one thousand four hundred. I said where is that on your website these updates they said we're not putting it on the web
[26:53.840 --> 27:02.840]  So I think there is an effort to control the message and to tamp it down. This is public information we have a right to and I think the media should not hype it but cover it
[27:02.840 --> 27:16.840]  Yeah my doctor friend a pretty serious guy flies around in helicopters to work said that they believe the cases are in the thousands. It's basically known
[27:16.840 --> 27:26.840]  and they don't want to panic you because they know you're going to blame Obama with the totally open border and say why we've had all these governors come out Rick Perry
[27:26.840 --> 27:39.840]  Jindal all of us they do something Scott Walker other governments but oh no no you know what dummies just shut up nothing's going on
[27:39.840 --> 27:50.840]  kind of like you get these calls all over the web all over YouTube all over info wars just because I said don't go out and shoot cops or call for violence
[27:50.840 --> 28:01.840]  don't cause don't start a civil war that the just departments tried to foment the Trayvon Martin they got caught trying to foment the last two the Garner and the Brown case they got caught
[28:01.840 --> 28:09.840]  to get us all each other's throats does that mean there aren't some problems with the police and militarization and attack dog training yes
[28:09.840 --> 28:20.840]  but you don't fix that walking up to a patrol car and shooting two family men in the head that you don't know they're a bad cop I mean even if they were a bad cop
[28:20.840 --> 28:30.840]  they get due process they don't get shot in the head and it was reported by the New York Post and the New York Daily News I have the articles that are on info wars dot com
[28:30.840 --> 28:42.840]  that people were cheering as they were in Brooklyn as they were trying to save them and give a mouth to mouth people are going good you deserve it and clapping like when the two cops got run over in Denver
[28:42.840 --> 28:54.840]  that is sick that is sick that is sick and that is what they're trying to get going in this country and they want to just demonize the patriot movement say we deserve to be killed

[33:07.840 --> 33:13.840]  the most transparent administration in history and I can document how that is the case
[33:13.840 --> 33:19.840]  American journalists at a media event have criticized the U.S. administration over transparency issues
[33:19.840 --> 33:25.840]  we cover what we are allowed to cover lack of transparency is a huge political advantage
[33:25.840 --> 33:31.840]  information management has become so sophisticated every administration learns from the previous
[33:31.840 --> 33:41.840]  actions I have the legal authority to take as president what do you say to someone who believes the president took action to change the law
[33:41.840 --> 33:49.840]  we did not change the law we act within the law what they're not paying attention to is the fact that I just took an action to change the law
[33:49.840 --> 34:10.840]  breaking the law breaking the law breaking the law breaking the law breaking the law, breaking the law breaking the law breaking the law
[34:10.840 --> 34:24.680]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[34:24.680 --> 34:33.320]  We're live, ladies and gentlemen, the 21st day already of December 2014.
[34:33.320 --> 34:38.320]  As I've been saying the last few months, 2014 is very long in the tooth, big white beard,
[34:38.320 --> 34:45.840]  and soon the year will die, and a new year will be born.
[34:45.840 --> 34:50.840]  And I want to be very clear here, a lot of really positive things are happening, not
[34:50.840 --> 34:54.000]  just here but around the globe.
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.000]  A lot of people are waking up to the tenets of liberty and true competition and prosperity.
[35:01.000 --> 35:05.560]  And corrupt power structures are moving to try to block and suppress populations, and
[35:05.560 --> 35:09.240]  that's only going to have the effect of causing more resistance.
[35:09.240 --> 35:19.720]  But we don't need mindless, criminal, stupid resistance to apparent evils.
[35:19.720 --> 35:30.560]  An apparent wrong of Garner being choked to death in New York or Long Island is not right
[35:30.560 --> 35:38.080]  to then go and shoot two police officers in the head in cold blood and then go kill yourself
[35:38.080 --> 35:41.680]  because you just shot your girlfriend to death and, well, instead of killing yourself, you're
[35:41.680 --> 35:45.480]  just going to go have death by cop or take a few with you.
[35:45.480 --> 35:46.480]  And that's what I've said.
[35:46.480 --> 35:48.680]  This is a trend I see getting promoted by the media.
[35:48.680 --> 35:54.440]  It will create copycats, just like 2020 had to admit in a special in 1995 that we've played
[35:54.440 --> 36:02.000]  clips of that death education started in 1990 and within three years it doubled and tripled
[36:02.000 --> 36:05.480]  suicides in high schools and middle schools.
[36:05.480 --> 36:11.360]  You teach 13-year-olds how to hang themselves or how to take pills or how to shoot themselves
[36:11.360 --> 36:19.800]  to say, don't do it, you've now put in their mind, don't do it.
[36:19.800 --> 36:22.520]  And it caused massive suicide increases.
[36:22.520 --> 36:30.960]  And the media starts hyping race riots and infighting and, oh, you're mad at the government.
[36:30.960 --> 36:38.240]  The thing to do is go blame the lowest level rubber meets the road police.
[36:38.240 --> 36:41.520]  And as you know, I'm the big critic of the globalists taken over the police, but not
[36:41.520 --> 36:42.520]  of the police.
[36:42.520 --> 36:43.920]  I'm the big critic of the police state.
[36:43.920 --> 36:48.600]  I'm the big critic of the MRAPs and the helicopters looking through our walls and all of it because
[36:48.600 --> 36:54.560]  I understand it's federalized, it's globalized, it is designed to convert us to a tyranny.
[36:54.560 --> 36:57.920]  But to do that, they've got to get a war going with us and the police that they've gotten
[36:57.920 --> 37:04.360]  the police ready for.
[37:04.360 --> 37:10.400]  Instead we need to take back our counties, our cities, our states and take back our police.
[37:10.400 --> 37:15.560]  And as I've said many times, and the statistics show it, they are one of the most awake groups
[37:15.560 --> 37:19.040]  compared to the general public, they are not our enemies.
[37:19.040 --> 37:24.240]  If we simply don't let the mind game work on us, we can checkmate the globalist right
[37:24.240 --> 37:28.240]  now.
[37:28.240 --> 37:32.160]  The way to demonstrate is the way that more than 500 people showed up and spoke in.
[37:32.160 --> 37:39.120]  Many of them are listeners with our crew, they're covering it to cover the event.
[37:39.120 --> 37:43.040]  And the police union, the sheriff's unions come out and criticize the police chief following
[37:43.040 --> 37:47.880]  Obama doctrine, Justice Department doctrine saying constitutionalist veterans, gun owners
[37:47.880 --> 37:52.440]  are the main threat and we've got sheriff deputies on tape saying it is veterans and
[37:52.440 --> 37:54.160]  we got a lot of guns in this county.
[37:54.160 --> 37:58.480]  Well, quote, there's a lot of guns here, a lot of constitutionalists and we may take
[37:58.480 --> 38:03.320]  enemy fire.
[38:03.320 --> 38:08.560]  Well our demonstrators didn't go out and attack police or shoot anybody or burn down anything.
[38:08.560 --> 38:13.200]  They went out and talked about the Constitution Bill of Rights exposed the Southern Barbary
[38:13.200 --> 38:16.640]  Law Center and ADL that are running this in the White House.
[38:16.640 --> 38:19.800]  And I saw the live feeds, I was here, you know, we were here for four hours doing a
[38:19.800 --> 38:24.640]  special report yesterday covering the whole protest.
[38:24.640 --> 38:29.520]  The police were super nice, brought us back, showed us the MRAB, set on record.
[38:29.520 --> 38:34.560]  We don't like what was said and, you know, the sheriff's back down from that and our
[38:34.560 --> 38:39.040]  guys talked to the cops off record, they're listeners.
[38:39.040 --> 38:42.560]  The sheriff's department, a bunch of MRAB listeners, we already knew that.
[38:42.560 --> 38:47.480]  So see, we're not going to go up and walk through police car and shoot two people on
[38:47.480 --> 38:48.480]  the head.
[38:48.480 --> 38:50.360]  That's not how we take America back.
[38:50.360 --> 38:53.400]  That's how you destroy the country and start a civil war.
[38:53.400 --> 38:59.480]  But the Democratic parties push with Al Sharpton and the mayor, the socialist mayor of New
[38:59.480 --> 39:05.520]  York, with this I can't breathe business, and I think that is excessive force and looks
[39:05.520 --> 39:11.560]  really bad and I discussed me, but does that mean you go execute police and cold blood?
[39:11.560 --> 39:13.120]  Absolutely not.
[39:13.120 --> 39:19.560]  The justice department is all over this trying to stir this up right now, and it could start
[39:19.560 --> 39:20.560]  a race for civil war.
[39:20.560 --> 39:22.760]  In fact, it's already starting to get to that point.
[39:22.760 --> 39:28.800]  There are racial attacks I see in local news as I scan it four or five times a day that
[39:28.800 --> 39:29.800]  they're getting reported.
[39:29.800 --> 39:35.680]  You know a fraction get reported where whites are being attacked everywhere by black racists
[39:35.680 --> 39:40.000]  that think it's a legitimate form to beat a white person in the head with a hammer or
[39:40.000 --> 39:41.000]  shoot them.
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.720]  So what they've done is the justice department has put white people in cops over here and
[39:46.720 --> 39:51.320]  then put black folks or anybody who's in the inner city over here, a lot of white folks
[39:51.320 --> 39:56.160]  in the inner city, a lot of Hispanics, to just all start hating each other and fighting
[39:56.160 --> 40:00.720]  each other while foreign banks swindle and loot all of us, and while Ebola is clearly
[40:00.720 --> 40:05.640]  being covered up inside the United States, I just played Fox News saying that they admit
[40:05.640 --> 40:10.920]  they have a bunch of suspected cases, thousands of them, and they're covering it up.
[40:10.920 --> 40:15.400]  Forbes said they were at the meeting where it was agreed upon two months ago.
[40:15.400 --> 40:17.280]  Do you understand?
[40:17.280 --> 40:19.640]  We just report the facts here.
[40:19.640 --> 40:21.160]  I don't care if it's sensational.
[40:21.160 --> 40:26.800]  We will tell you.
[40:26.800 --> 40:31.960]  Speaking of political correctness when we come back, Obama, Sony did the wrong thing
[40:31.960 --> 40:32.960]  when it pulled the movie.
[40:32.960 --> 40:34.720]  Boy, I hate agreeing with Obama.
[40:34.720 --> 40:36.040]  That's one of the cases I do.
[40:36.040 --> 40:39.960]  He says you don't give in to terrorist threats, whoever's behind it.
[40:39.960 --> 40:43.040]  North Korea says that it was probably launched by the CIA.
[40:43.040 --> 40:49.520]  I don't know who it was launched by, but the globalists are not above doing it.
[40:49.520 --> 40:50.800]  But it is true now.
[40:50.800 --> 40:56.920]  Now the so-called terrorist group is threatening that if Team America airs, they'll blow it
[40:56.920 --> 40:57.920]  up.
[40:57.920 --> 41:02.760]  And so Alamo Draft House, and I'm not kidding, I love Team America, even though it's very
[41:02.760 --> 41:03.760]  risque.
[41:03.760 --> 41:04.760]  I think it's so funny.
[41:04.760 --> 41:06.960]  It's one of my favorite satire movies.
[41:06.960 --> 41:12.000]  I was planning to go see it in Austin at the limited showing because I hadn't seen it since
[41:12.000 --> 41:16.720]  it came out in 2004 in the theater, and they pulled the stinking thing.
[41:16.720 --> 41:22.040]  I think, I don't think I'm going to rent a theater next week.
[41:22.040 --> 41:26.680]  I want to get on the horn and find some theaters that aren't total chickens, and I'm going
[41:26.680 --> 41:28.280]  to rent a theater free to the public.
[41:28.280 --> 41:34.760]  I could sell tickets, but I'm not going to maybe a 300 seater or something.
[41:34.760 --> 41:35.760]  You know what?
[41:35.760 --> 41:36.760]  I bet this country so cowardly.
[41:36.760 --> 41:40.280]  I bet I can't, and so politically correct, because political correctness means when they
[41:40.280 --> 41:44.400]  tell you not to speak or not to say something, you do it.
[41:44.400 --> 41:46.680]  It means you value having no free speech.
[41:46.680 --> 41:53.320]  We absolutely must show Team America and the interview now, or this country's done, stick
[41:53.320 --> 41:54.320]  a fork in it.
[41:54.320 --> 41:57.320]  Soon every country will be in complete chaos.
[41:57.320 --> 42:05.040]  To save the world from falling apart, and so you see, the new world is inevitable.
[42:05.040 --> 42:06.040]  It's what?
[42:06.040 --> 42:07.040]  Inevitable.
[42:07.040 --> 42:08.040]  Inevitable.
[42:08.040 --> 42:09.040]  One more time?
[42:09.040 --> 42:10.040]  Inevitable.
[42:10.040 --> 42:14.360]  Things are inevitable, but are you going to change?
[42:14.360 --> 42:19.800]  When we learn he's really an alien cockroach that climbs out of his body at the end.
[42:19.800 --> 42:24.680]  It's not about sex, Gary.
[42:24.680 --> 42:28.440]  This country's, this is a global government, where the UN says we can't have guns, we can't
[42:28.440 --> 42:32.480]  have coal power plants, so they come after our coal plants and guns.
[42:32.480 --> 42:38.440]  Or North Korea that can't even build an automobile, that's why I doubt they did the hacking, can
[42:38.440 --> 42:42.880]  hardly watch, that thinks Dennis Rodman's cool, and that shows you how delusional Kim
[42:42.880 --> 42:47.560]  Jung-un is, they're going to blow stuff up if we show a movie.
[42:47.560 --> 42:48.560]  We'll go to hell.
[42:48.560 --> 42:52.080]  I mean, what is wrong with this country?
[42:52.080 --> 42:59.880]  Show the movies, get rid of the censorship.
[42:59.880 --> 43:04.440]  Sold out for weeks through the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation,
[43:04.440 --> 43:10.040]  the exclusive InfoWars Life Secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment

[43:36.080 --> 43:40.120]  of two organic, proprietary forms of vitamin B12.

[43:59.920 --> 44:04.160]  Another major health threat, this one in Toledo, Ohio where everybody in the entire city has
[44:04.160 --> 44:06.000]  been told not to drink the water.
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.640]  Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[44:08.640 --> 44:14.360]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every
[44:14.360 --> 44:15.680]  single day?
[44:15.680 --> 44:18.680]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[44:18.680 --> 44:21.640]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[44:21.640 --> 44:23.640]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo.
[44:23.640 --> 44:26.560]  You can see the shelves empty where water once was.

[45:29.520 --> 45:33.200]  The government's Department of Homeland Security is buying up loads of ammo.
[45:33.200 --> 45:37.560]  At the same time, they're restricting civilians' rights to own and purchase firearms.
[45:37.560 --> 45:39.600]  Can you put two and two together?
[45:39.600 --> 45:45.160]  Infidel Body Armor can stop every round, including hollow points and.308 sniper rounds, is reasonably

[47:02.400 --> 47:09.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:09.680 --> 47:16.120]  In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem.
[47:16.120 --> 47:20.280]  Government is the problem.
[47:20.280 --> 47:25.440]  From time to time, we've been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be
[47:25.440 --> 47:27.960]  managed by self-rule.
[47:27.960 --> 47:35.320]  That government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people.
[47:35.320 --> 47:36.320]  Sounds pretty terrorist.
[47:36.320 --> 47:40.920]  The Alex Jones Show because there is a war on for your mind.
[47:40.920 --> 47:42.960]  Who is that extremist I heard talking?
[47:42.960 --> 47:43.960]  Me.
[47:43.960 --> 47:44.960]  Me the real man.
[47:44.960 --> 47:45.960]  Ronald Reagan.
[47:45.960 --> 47:46.960]  And my misfits.
[47:46.960 --> 47:47.960]  Wave lights.
[47:47.960 --> 47:48.960]  That's Dave Mustaine.
[47:48.960 --> 47:52.960]  Back past is my most valued possession.
[47:52.960 --> 47:53.960]  Possession.
[47:53.960 --> 47:55.960]  Main site is always 2020.
[47:55.960 --> 47:56.960]  Looking back.
[47:56.960 --> 47:57.960]  Still a bit fuzzy.
[47:57.960 --> 47:58.960]  Speak of mutually assured destruction.
[47:58.960 --> 47:59.960]  Nice to worry.
[47:59.960 --> 48:00.960]  That's what the second amendment's about.
[48:00.960 --> 48:11.560]  If you get a tyrannical government that comes after the people, it's mutually assured destruction.
[48:11.560 --> 48:15.720]  But in North Korea, communist China, or Nazi Germany, or Soviet Russia, the people don't
[48:15.720 --> 48:18.360]  have guns, or Fidel's Cuba.
[48:18.360 --> 48:23.960]  By the way, I'm all for normalizing relations with Cuba, not because I like communism.
[48:23.960 --> 48:27.680]  It has only been the fact that there's been an embargo so long that's allowed communism
[48:27.680 --> 48:29.200]  to continue there.
[48:29.200 --> 48:34.800]  The minute you let US money in there, the minute you let the terrorists really in there, that
[48:34.800 --> 48:37.240]  stuff will fall so fast.
[48:37.240 --> 48:41.200]  The average person in Cuba can't even have a bicycle.
[48:41.200 --> 48:43.360]  They squid three or four times a day.
[48:43.360 --> 48:45.360]  That's not just a quote from Scarface.
[48:45.360 --> 48:52.640]  Oh, yeah, they got more doctors than any country in the world, but can't do any medical procedures.
[48:52.640 --> 48:56.360]  It's a joke, like North Korea.
[48:56.360 --> 48:59.040]  Now Obama's trying to, at least on the surface, normalize relations.
[48:59.040 --> 49:00.040]  I'd love to get into Cuba.
[49:00.040 --> 49:02.840]  I know I could go there illegally, but I'm not going to.
[49:02.840 --> 49:03.840]  It's just a beautiful country.
[49:03.840 --> 49:07.560]  I've talked to people who go scuba diving there, they say nothing like it.
[49:07.560 --> 49:08.560]  I love.
[49:08.560 --> 49:14.720]  I wish Cuba was rich and successful and great.
[49:14.720 --> 49:17.760]  I wish there was some countries close to here because this place falls.
[49:17.760 --> 49:22.000]  I could go to, but you know what, they're not many.
[49:22.000 --> 49:25.040]  That's the problem.
[49:25.040 --> 49:29.320]  Getting back to free speech, Obama says Sony did the wrong thing when it pulled the movie.
[49:29.320 --> 49:32.760]  I wish they had spoken to me first, he said.
[49:32.760 --> 49:37.280]  I would have told them not to not get into a pattern in which you're intimidated by these
[49:37.280 --> 49:40.880]  kinds of criminal attacks.
[49:40.880 --> 49:46.560]  The head of Sony went on to tell CNN we have not cave.
[49:46.560 --> 49:47.760]  We have not given in.
[49:47.760 --> 49:53.840]  We have persevered, he told Fareed Zarkaria, what a load of bull.
[49:53.840 --> 49:58.520]  We have persevered by announcing they're not going to release the movie and have a $200
[49:58.520 --> 50:01.240]  million loss.
[50:01.240 --> 50:04.400]  And then now to follow suit, I don't know, it was a stunt.
[50:04.400 --> 50:05.400]  I know Tim Lee.
[50:05.400 --> 50:08.480]  I can call him up knowing back when he first founded the Alamo draft house.
[50:08.480 --> 50:16.480]  In theater, not hundreds around the country, they're not showing Team America.
[50:16.480 --> 50:21.640]  How ridiculous is that theaters owned by Alamo that we're going to have a showing of it
[50:21.640 --> 50:27.600]  to dovetail with the release of the interview are pulling the showings.
[50:27.600 --> 50:30.560]  But they say it's because the distributor doesn't want it shown.
[50:30.560 --> 50:35.000]  Team America is benched, won't return to theaters, reports say.
[50:35.000 --> 50:39.200]  One day after some theaters vowed to screen America, world police in the place of the
[50:39.200 --> 50:44.800]  interview whose release was canceled Wednesday, word has emerged that Team America has also
[50:44.800 --> 50:45.800]  been pulled.
[50:45.800 --> 50:47.880]  Both films made light of North Korea.
[50:47.880 --> 50:55.520]  I mean, do you understand that it's been a cult underground deal to make fun of Kim
[50:55.520 --> 50:57.920]  Jung-un and his dad, Kim Jung-il?
[50:57.920 --> 51:02.200]  I mean, I own a teacup making fun of them.
[51:02.200 --> 51:06.480]  With an image of women in bathing suits chasing him down the beach.
[51:06.480 --> 51:10.040]  In fact, guys, I was going to tweet it and I forgot to do it.
[51:10.040 --> 51:12.200]  Somebody changed the Hollywood sign to say North Korea.
[51:12.200 --> 51:14.280]  I want to tweet that out.
[51:14.280 --> 51:17.880]  Hollywood to now adopt North Korean policies because that's what it's doing.
[51:17.880 --> 51:22.720]  And we have a big graphic on the front page of infowars.com right now that says like big
[51:22.720 --> 51:26.400]  government, move to North Korea.
[51:26.400 --> 51:27.920]  That's actually an Alex Jones quote.
[51:27.920 --> 51:32.760]  We should just add Alex Jones quote, I don't care, but we always had the quote on there.
[51:32.760 --> 51:33.760]  That's an Alex Jones quote.
[51:33.760 --> 51:34.760]  Why?
[51:34.760 --> 51:35.760]  Big government?
[51:35.760 --> 51:39.440]  Oh yeah, we should all just cry when Kim Jung-il died for three days straight or we'll
[51:39.440 --> 51:42.000]  be sent for 10 years hard labor.
[51:42.000 --> 51:51.920]  Oh, you're our leader, oh, we love you so much.
[51:51.920 --> 51:55.360]  Totally and completely disgusting.
[51:55.360 --> 51:57.200]  So there you go, that's the state of the country.
[51:57.200 --> 52:00.440]  And if we don't make a big deal out of this, the tyrants win.
[52:00.440 --> 52:06.480]  Oh, better not criticize Obamacare or they will call you a racist.
[52:06.480 --> 52:12.520]  Oh, better not be a gun owner or the government might come after you.
[52:12.520 --> 52:13.880]  Oh, better not be in the Tea Party.
[52:13.880 --> 52:15.640]  The IRS will audit you.
[52:15.640 --> 52:17.280]  The threat is giving in.
[52:17.280 --> 52:18.520]  The threat is bowing.
[52:18.520 --> 52:20.040]  They will take everything.
[52:20.040 --> 52:28.040]  We are going into bonafide, 200 proof, classical, hardcore, 100 percent tyranny on every front
[52:28.040 --> 52:31.160]  because good people won't organize and say no.
[52:31.160 --> 52:33.840]  We're a world of yes men now in the West.
[52:33.840 --> 52:41.840]  The president of the United States can change the enforcement thereof under his executive
[52:41.840 --> 52:44.520]  branch powers.
[52:44.520 --> 52:54.800]  We propose to the United States government to take mutual measures for the improvement
[52:54.800 --> 52:56.920]  of our bilateral climate.
[52:56.920 --> 53:03.040]  That's Raul Castro, the president now that Fidel's dilapidated and in convalescence permanently.
[53:03.040 --> 53:08.360]  I got to admit, Phil Castro is a tough bird, formerly CIA trained in the United States
[53:08.360 --> 53:09.360]  on record.
[53:09.360 --> 53:12.880]  You tell the ignorant public they don't even know he worked for Eisenhower and then double
[53:12.880 --> 53:14.920]  crossed him.
[53:14.920 --> 53:21.160]  People don't even know all this stuff, but now he's saying unilaterally you as an executive
[53:21.160 --> 53:22.160]  can do this.
[53:22.160 --> 53:23.360]  No Obama can't do that.
[53:23.360 --> 53:28.560]  He can't violate congressional law because he feels like it, like he's on the border
[53:28.560 --> 53:31.560]  and guns and power plants and everything else.
[53:31.560 --> 53:44.000]  You see now dictators like Raul Castro took power what in like 60, 1960, how many years
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.760]  is that 40, 50, 54 years?
[53:46.760 --> 53:48.120]  That's enough.
[53:48.120 --> 53:50.920]  Just like it's enough, we're told that it's a done deal.
[53:50.920 --> 53:56.160]  It's going to be Jeb Bush, head to head, red state against blue state Hillary.
[53:56.160 --> 54:00.320]  Give me a break.
[54:00.320 --> 54:03.240]  New Clintons isn't enough, it's too many.
[54:03.240 --> 54:05.280]  Two Bushes isn't enough, it's too many.
[54:05.280 --> 54:10.840]  No more country club, blue blood, Rockefeller, turn your guns in, Republicans.
[54:10.840 --> 54:13.040]  Have you gotten the message from the Tea Party?
[54:13.040 --> 54:15.280]  Get out of here with your looted money.
[54:15.280 --> 54:17.080]  We're sick of you.
[54:17.080 --> 54:18.080]  We don't.
[54:18.080 --> 54:20.080]  I don't feel no ways tired.
[54:20.080 --> 54:23.120]  Yeah, that's Hillary doing a fake Kentucky accent.
[54:23.120 --> 54:28.600]  How dumb do they really think we are?
[54:28.600 --> 54:34.480]  Coming up, I'm going to give the number up and take calls specifically on just political
[54:34.480 --> 54:35.480]  correctness in general.
[54:35.480 --> 54:40.040]  What do you think the most outrageous examples of political correctness are?
[54:40.040 --> 54:43.160]  What is your take on the attempt to continue to ban Christmas?
[54:43.160 --> 54:48.520]  I mean, talk about Grinch like, what do you make of all of this?
[54:48.520 --> 54:50.680]  And then I've got a bunch of other news.
[54:50.680 --> 54:56.080]  Mayor Emanuel's son robbed outside family's Lakeview home in the wonderful gun-free zone
[54:56.080 --> 55:00.640]  that has the highest murder rate in the world, California puzzles over safety of driverless
[55:00.640 --> 55:01.640]  cars.
[55:01.640 --> 55:04.760]  I'm going to tie in some key intel on that front.
[55:04.760 --> 55:08.120]  Majority of Brits want to quit the EU, but the government won't let them.
[55:08.120 --> 55:10.160]  They never got to vote to be brought into it.
[55:10.160 --> 55:11.160]  That's globalism, folks.
[55:11.160 --> 55:16.160]  You just wake up and you're under a new government, just like we are under the Trans-Pacific Partnership.
[55:16.160 --> 55:20.600]  Did you know the United States is in the Pacific Ocean and is waiving every law and right we've
[55:20.600 --> 55:27.200]  got right now to secret treaties on record?
[55:27.200 --> 55:33.760]  NYPD shooting suspects referenced Garner and Brown cases, Wall Street Journal, no kidding.
[55:33.760 --> 55:36.480]  And it looks like he was an Islamist.
[55:36.480 --> 55:42.000]  Local police departments take precautions following deadly shooting of cops in Brooklyn.
[55:42.000 --> 55:45.440]  Doesn't this show the police that no amount of armored vehicles or checkpoints is going
[55:45.440 --> 55:47.400]  to protect you?
[55:47.400 --> 55:50.960]  Only a free society will protect you where you're virtuous and then people want to support
[55:50.960 --> 55:51.960]  you.
[55:51.960 --> 55:55.660]  If you let the Justice Department stir up racial hatred and imply that all police are
[55:55.660 --> 55:59.840]  racist killers, it's going to happen.
[55:59.840 --> 56:03.560]  Local police departments are now basically on alert.
[56:03.560 --> 56:09.080]  Police unions, others blast a blouse-y-o after shooting deaths of two NYPD cops because the
[56:09.080 --> 56:12.640]  mayor joined in with the Justice Department hate fest.
[56:12.640 --> 56:19.160]  NYPD cops furious turned their back on the mayor as he enters hospital where dead officers
[56:19.160 --> 56:20.160]  are held.
[56:20.160 --> 56:24.960]  Two NYPD officers assassinated while sitting in a patrol car in Brooklyn by government
[56:24.960 --> 56:30.240]  who boasted on Instagram about revenge killing cops saying, I'm going to put wings on cops
[56:30.240 --> 56:33.480]  today.
[56:33.480 --> 56:37.280]  So who needs suicide by cop when you just suicide by killing cop?
[56:37.280 --> 56:41.480]  This is what the media is pushing, it's the new trendy thing to do.
[56:41.480 --> 56:46.160]  Then the cops will get more violent, more aggressive, and then the cycle continues.
[56:46.160 --> 56:49.440]  Man-aimed empty gun and cops face pulled trigger.
[56:49.440 --> 56:50.440]  Police say.
[56:50.440 --> 56:51.440]  New York Post.
[56:51.440 --> 56:52.440]  Gun wasn't loaded anymore.
[56:52.440 --> 56:53.440]  Yeah, it wasn't loaded anymore.
[56:53.440 --> 56:57.800]  FBI issues warning, a black prison gang targeting white cops.
[56:57.800 --> 56:59.280]  That's just some of the news.
[56:59.280 --> 57:01.480]  Sharpton tries to back away from it.
[57:01.480 --> 57:06.440]  Before we end the shower, please don't take this radio transmission, the fact that you're
[57:06.440 --> 57:11.600]  hearing on local M&FM stations for granted, stations come, stations go, they change formats.
[57:11.600 --> 57:14.400]  They've never been on more stations, it doesn't matter.

[57:55.560 --> 57:56.560]  year.
[57:56.560 --> 57:59.120]  We take a step back and thank God for what we have.
[57:59.120 --> 58:02.400]  I'm David Hall, founder of Diamond Gusset Jeans.
[58:02.400 --> 58:06.320]  At Diamond Gusset, we are celebrating the brush fires of liberty that are spreading
[58:06.320 --> 58:08.760]  across this great nation.
[58:08.760 --> 58:11.280]  Another thing we are celebrating is you.
[58:11.280 --> 58:15.920]  Without the valued listeners of Alex Jones and our loyal customers, we wouldn't be here

[58:49.560 --> 58:54.240]  Sold out for weeks due to the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation,
[58:54.240 --> 58:59.880]  the exclusive InfoWarsLife secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment
[58:59.880 --> 59:00.880]  of 2014.
[59:00.880 --> 59:05.680]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process, this ultra clean
[59:05.680 --> 59:10.240]  vitamin B12 nutraceutical has been carefully crafted and developed over the last two years
[59:10.240 --> 59:15.400]  and is based on cellular science of how your body actively absorbs essential nutrients.
[59:15.400 --> 59:18.280]  Secret 12 is taken by mouth right on the tongue and then swallowed.
[59:18.280 --> 59:20.000]  No needles, no injections.
[59:20.000 --> 59:25.880]  Vitamin B12 deficiency is linked to scores of serious problems and secret 12 is a fusion
[59:25.880 --> 59:32.240]  of two organic proprietary forms of vitamin B12 bringing you a true nutraceutical quality
[59:32.240 --> 59:34.960]  vitamin B12 secret 12.
[59:34.960 --> 59:40.720]  Secret 12 is an excellent Christmas gift and is tailor made to boost your New Year's resolutions.

[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:25.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, the toll-free number to join us is 877-789-ALEX.
[01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:32.240]  That's 877-789-2539, the Sunday numbers, our own in-house phone system, different than
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.600]  the weekday number.
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:46.360]  So that, again, ladies and gentlemen, is a easy number to remember, 877-789-ALEX, 877-789-2539.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:49.640]  What are your most outrageous examples of political correctness?
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:53.120]  Probably trying to ban Christmas trees in Rockefeller Center, I would think that's probably
[01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:59.240]  it, or brown bags, but I want to hear your example and try to cite it if you can.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:04.800]  That would be more interesting, I think, to wage war on political correctness, and also,
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:10.240]  how do you think Obama and the globalist attempt to start a race war is going?
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:16.760]  Not too good, black against white, but very nicely against the police, and you disagree
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:20.880]  with my analysis or analyses on that front.
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:29.560]  I want to hear from you on that issue here today.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:34.000]  Now, this is kind of a no man's land, some stations don't care this little first five
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:38.120]  minute segment, but you notice I did about a 30-second plug at the end of the last hour.
[01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:42.800]  I really should hype this more because you are the power.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:43.800]  You are the answer.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:46.000]  You are the engine of infowars.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:50.800]  You resonate with our message of truth and freedom and justice and trying to not be played
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.220]  like a fiddle by the establishment.
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:57.480]  It is you telling friends and family about the broadcast that makes it possible.
[01:01:57.480 --> 01:02:02.760]  It is you getting friends to download the free iPhone, Android apps, and to tell folks
[01:02:02.760 --> 01:02:04.120]  how they can tune in.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.640]  That's how this happens.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:12.600]  It is you who have prismplanet.tv memberships to see all the films and the ebooks and other
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:16.320]  documentaries and the nightly news and special live reports.
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.120]  You are the ones that pay to let us give a free feed of the Daily Radio show that cost
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:24.480]  me tens of thousands of months just in bandwidth.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:30.760]  It is you that allows us to say 20 people can use each membership so you can get friends
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:32.760]  and family to tune in.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.360]  That is where the real war is.
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.680]  We cover the big news.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:37.520]  We have the hardcore guest on.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:42.560]  We give people a deep analysis of what's happening and they're hungry for it, but if a tree falls
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:47.160]  in the forest and nobody is there to hear it, it doesn't make a sound.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:48.160]  Perception is reality.
[01:02:48.160 --> 01:02:53.520]  So commit this Christmas and this new year to talk about world government, to talk about
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:03:00.440]  the new world order, to get friends and family, to tune in to this radio show and to spread
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:03.160]  the word because we are growing.
[01:03:03.160 --> 01:03:07.920]  But we've hit, I knew we'd hit more resistance from the establishment and dirty tricks, but
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:12.520]  we've hit major resistance on a bunch of fronts and they politically kicked us off XM and
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:18.120]  serious and there's campaigns to remove us off AM and FM around the country and some
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.200]  of it's successful.
[01:03:19.200 --> 01:03:25.640]  We're growing fast enough that it's not taking us down, but we're moving forward in the battle,
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:28.440]  but it's having an effect and we expect that.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.240]  I've been crushed before.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:36.520]  We're not even being pushed back right now, though it's slowing us down.
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:40.920]  I've been hammered down to like 20% of what I was audience wise for telling the truth
[01:03:40.920 --> 01:03:47.800]  before, but we always after that happens and we don't compromise, we just explode afterwards.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:51.400]  So we're being hit with, I'm not going to belabor it and get into all of it, but there's
[01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:55.600]  all sorts of just an incredible, I mean, can you imagine what the system is trying to do
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:59.400]  to shut us down, but where they don't get to blame because if they do it wrong and get
[01:03:59.400 --> 01:04:03.760]  caught doing it like media matters got caught in those memos four years ago saying we're
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:07.240]  going to infiltrate alternative conservative media and destroy it from within.
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:10.960]  We're going to infiltrate the tea party and pull dirty tricks and blaming on them.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:13.160]  That's false flags.
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:20.760]  And by the grace of God, we've discovered operators, activities, it is Providence.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:24.520]  The stuff that happens around here, how we learn about what people are doing.
[01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.600]  It's like fight club.
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.360]  The only problem is I have no way to even reach out to our listeners, our fans, our
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:34.640]  supporters and get one tense of their intel, but they just stopped the enemy operations
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:36.560]  on their own.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:45.720]  Most citizens, hairdressers, bookstore owners, police, school teachers, you name it, they
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:48.080]  are there like fight club.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:49.080]  It's like fight club.
[01:04:49.080 --> 01:04:53.040]  My life is like fight club where we've got so many listeners now.
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:55.040]  We've got human everywhere.
[01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:59.040]  The establishment better be worried than they are.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:03.560]  Sold out for weeks through the difficult and extensive proprietary process behind its creation.
[01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:09.200]  The exclusive infowars life secret 12 formulation is now back in stock in the last limited shipment
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.200]  of 2014.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:15.000]  The most bioactive form that has been created with our proprietary process, this ultra clean

[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:29.360]  I am sworn upon the order of God, internal hostility against every form of death.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:07:10.360]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:23.160]  What are your worst cases of political correctness or do you support a North Korean society here
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:41.560]  in America?
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:58.440]  What are your worst cases of political correctness or do you support a North Korean society here
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:59.440]  in America?
[01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:17.200]  What are your worst cases of political correctness or do you support a North Korean society here
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:18.200]  in America?
[01:08:18.200 --> 01:08:22.200]  What are your worst cases of political correctness or do you support a North Korean society here
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.200]  in America?
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:37.880]  What are your worst cases of political correctness or do you support a North Korean society here
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:38.880]  in America?
[01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.840]  What are your worst cases of political correctness or do you support a North Korean society here
[01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:42.840]  in America?
[01:08:42.840 --> 01:08:49.560]  a doctor on who manages three hospitals. I've talked to other medical doctors. They are saying
[01:08:49.560 --> 01:08:57.000]  Ebola is being covered up. Incredible. Fox investigation. CDC may be hiding Ebola cases.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:04.600]  Further priv services of widespread cover up infowars.com. Red linked article right now
[01:09:05.560 --> 01:09:12.120]  on infowars.com. In fact, I see that's blue linked. Can we red link that? Thank you,
[01:09:12.120 --> 01:09:17.320]  Michele Phelan. She's up here working right now on Sunday night with us doing a great job.
[01:09:18.840 --> 01:09:22.440]  So I want to get your take on that little piece of news.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:32.600]  Now a 10 billion dollar UN linked climate change fund wants immunity from prosecution.
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:38.280]  Remember, they already wanted to get UN divided by the community for the climate
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:42.360]  training fund. It's been involved in so much serious corruption. This is Fox News as well.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.760]  Al Gore and others are involved. Well, now United Nations affiliated piggy bank intended
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:50.760]  to finance climate change projects around the world is determined to win sweeping UN style
[01:09:50.760 --> 01:09:54.680]  immunities for prosecutions for its global operations. Even though the US, its biggest
[01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:59.400]  contributor opposes the idea and the UN itself says its own diplomatic community
[01:09:59.400 --> 01:10:04.200]  can't cover the outfit. They want that over all their pump and dump type activities.
[01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:09.000]  And they're full of taxpayer money.
[01:10:11.960 --> 01:10:15.800]  Continuing, ladies and gentlemen, with the news that I've got here
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:23.960]  in the stack, speaking of global governance, majority, this is RT, majority of Brits want
[01:10:23.960 --> 01:10:28.680]  to quit EU poll shows. Among the six European states participating in a poll questioning
[01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:32.840]  EU membership, the British appeared most certain of all they want to leave the union
[01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:39.080]  with only 37 percent against breaking ties. Again, they were never given a chance to vote
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:46.120]  on the EU setting 83 percent of British or UK laws. The French opinion way polls showed 40 percent
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:51.160]  of British respondents want to leave the EU while 37 percent say they're staying in the union
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:55.480]  and 21 percent are not sure of the answer. A figure reported on Wednesday, the numbers are
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:11:05.240]  much higher. I see British polls like 90 percent went out and it goes on. So that's what globalism
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:13.960]  is where groups you didn't even vote to join are controlling what you do inside your own country,
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:19.480]  like trying to ban fireplaces and water wells. That's going on in Europe. Now they're trying it in
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:26.840]  England. This is the true tyranny that we're dealing with. Imagine living in Chicago. We got
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:32.040]  two great affiliates in Chicago. Imagine living in Chicago. That's a great city in many areas,
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:37.480]  but in the south side, Mayor Emmanuel Sun, though, who lives in the wealthy area, not safe.
[01:11:38.040 --> 01:11:44.360]  Sun robbed outside family's Lakeview home. CBS News reports the guy that wants total
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:50.600]  ban for citizens who has bodyguards. Well, his son wasn't immune, was he? The teenage son of
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:55.320]  Mayor Rahm Emanuel was the victim of a robbery outside the mayor's Lakeview home Friday night.
[01:11:55.320 --> 01:12:01.960]  A spokesman for the mayor's office confirms police were called the 4,200 block of hermitage
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:08.120]  at 10.05 p.m. Friday for a report of a robbery on the street where they would normally already
[01:12:08.120 --> 01:12:12.200]  be a police presence. Oh yeah, they normally keep there to guard the mayor because he doesn't live
[01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:19.480]  like everybody else. He has armed bodyguards, taxpayer pay. Just like the disgraced CNN red
[01:12:19.480 --> 01:12:24.280]  coat who he destroyed, and they admit even in the LA Times, it was the beginning and the end of his
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:31.640]  ratings. Pierce Morgan, he had armed bodyguards at his house, a little hypocritic turd. Emmanuel's
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:37.240]  17-year-old son went out to make a phone call when he was jumped by two men who stole the teen's
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:44.440]  cell phone. A police report obtained by the Chicago Tribune says that he was put in a
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:49.960]  chokehold, that's the classic mugging, by one of the suspects and punched the face by another.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:56.200]  Emanuel reportedly suffered a fat lip and chipped tooth. Oh, well taxpayer money will pay for that.
[01:12:56.200 --> 01:13:02.040]  Emanuel spokesperson Kelly Quinn released a statement saying yesterday evening Mayor Emanuel's
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:08.680]  son Zach was assaulted in a robbery during which his phone was stolen. He sustained injuries and
[01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:13.240]  required medical treatment but was able to join the family for a long planned trip. The mayor's
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:17.800]  focus is on his son's well-being and his parents. He and Amy asked the media to respect the family's
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:24.920]  privacy at this time. Oh, what about the 15 people killed a week, the 40-something shot?
[01:13:24.920 --> 01:13:30.760]  What about all the racially motivated attacks you cover up? Oh, and I bet money this one was.
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:37.960]  But that's okay because they're going to post more police at your house until everything
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:42.840]  collapses and the city's burning and the police have to go take care of their families and then
[01:13:42.840 --> 01:13:48.200]  no one's going to protect you. I know, Rom, you'll jump on an airplane and head out to Switzerland.
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:56.360]  Job complete, America destroyed. Don't let a good crisis go to waste, Tom Mayor.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:05.080]  We're going to go to break and come back and start taking your phone calls and then I'm going
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:13.080]  to get into a bunch of other news that I haven't even covered yet but there is a lot to get into.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:21.400]  You've got a gunman executing cops as revenge for another jurisdiction, somebody being choked to
[01:14:21.400 --> 01:14:26.760]  death and that's how it works, just mindless killing on the streets
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:34.600]  and it's going to only make race and police relations that much worse.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:37.320]  We'll talk about that coming up as well.
[01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:44.360]  Thousands of protesters storm all of America. It's really class warfare
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:53.960]  saying that again, it's racism. Why don't people protest against the banking cartels
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.160]  that have hijacked the nation? That's another question I have for everybody.
[01:14:57.160 --> 01:15:02.200]  Now, I'm really hammering this today because if you order stuff at infowarstore.com,
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:05.800]  you're not going to get it by Christmas by now. We appreciate everybody's patronage

[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:08.040]  our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:13.080]  that's toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants
[01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:18.440]  than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:23.720]  within their homes. There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand

[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:03.000]  and standing up against bad cops and standing up for good cops and standing up for good citizens

[01:21:54.600 --> 01:22:00.360]  my call today on this sunday when i was a young man here in california about nine years ago i was
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:06.920]  a police cadet and i experienced many types of racism uh not only within the department i was in
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:14.840]  but with the people i was around growing up uh when i was a young man i actually liked rap music i
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:22.120]  liked a lot of the culture of african-americans and when i was a young man i got a lot of black
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:29.160]  for that being called i was um uh that i wanted to be black and that was never the case i never
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:36.200]  told you that white people are black people everybody did um and it really affected me
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:41.320]  as a young man and i ended up not becoming a police cadet and then what was weird is you always
[01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:47.640]  talk about the uh the recruitment and the police training and i went through riot training as a
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:52.920]  cadet i went through the ui checkpoint training i mean i've done all this and then i hear you're
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:58.120]  talking about it eight years later so it hit me today so that's why i called in well what i talk
[01:22:58.120 --> 01:23:03.400]  about is when they're training girl scouts and boy and boy scouts for future gun confiscation

[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:29.400]  youth i wasn't criticizing the boy scouts or the girl scouts uh or the brownies i was saying don't

[01:24:55.640 --> 01:24:58.920]  i've said this about 5 000 times thomas jefferson was a liberal
[01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:07.080]  the democratic party today is a criminal mafia looting the country with their accomplice the
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:12.840]  republican leadership and they are using weaponized media systems to dumb us down and control us
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:17.480]  now my question is and you can say whatever you want after that what is your examples of
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:24.760]  political correctness out of control or do you like it john is calling from fema region five

[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:39.880]  up in chicago we had a precinct camp that come to our house and pretty much threatened my my
[01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:48.360]  father's job if he didn't vote for daily okay and i don't know why all the corrupt politicians
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:55.080]  come from the south side because the south side's a pretty good place really but uh i hope these
[01:25:55.960 --> 01:26:01.480]  these black leaders and all these other people that it's not ever going to occur to them the
[01:26:01.480 --> 01:26:08.280]  ones the globalists have control they don't need them anymore oh they already don't need black
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:12.280]  voters they've got the illegal vote now they're done that's why black unemployment doubled they're
[01:26:12.280 --> 01:26:17.400]  done they're cutting the money off to the black folks it's it's it's and then then it's going to
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:22.040]  blow up just like they knew the arab spring was coming google admits they helped run it
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:27.720]  they knew when food prices went up 20 it would trigger riots so they were there to steer it
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:33.560]  and put radical islamists in i mean how sick is that so they're cutting the money off the black
[01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:40.120]  community what do you think is going to happen well the same thing you know back in the 60s
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:46.840]  when i was growing up before the um before 68 and that martin lucid king was marching through my
[01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:54.280]  neighborhood for his demonstrations at market park there were times that i was that he didn't go
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:27:00.440]  through in my neighborhood an hour later i saw i see george minkin wrap all in america not the party
[01:27:00.440 --> 01:27:08.200]  and his group marked into their neighborhood to protest the same day i mean it's insane i
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:14.200]  it's all coordinated balkanization god bless you i appreciate your call
[01:27:15.640 --> 01:27:21.080]  it really is coordinated balkanization it's just that simple let's get one more before
[01:27:21.080 --> 01:27:27.640]  we got a break richard in rhode island richard you're on the air yeah hi alex uh i wanted to
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:33.000]  say uh first we're conspiracy realists not conspiracy theorists sure we're not chumps that
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:38.760]  believe known liars we figured out how the basic world works and we don't believe known liars but
[01:27:38.760 --> 01:27:45.640]  but onto this uh this deputy from spokane i believe we committed political correctness against him in
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:53.960]  reverse uh we heard him say about uh constitutionalists like guns and ammo and then he said i don't
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:28:01.560]  believe i believe 99.9 of them are all right well it appears the splc has deceived this man and
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:06.520]  they're thinking they're going to go against the kkk and the arian brotherhood who are not
[01:28:06.520 --> 01:28:11.560]  constitutionalist they're terrorists so well yeah i mean the kkk and the arian brotherhood are on
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:17.800]  record fed justice department run to be tied to the liberty movement uh and are protected and are
[01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:26.120]  national socialist so what all i'm saying is that i i think we shouldn't jump on this guy i i i don't
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:31.960]  certainly don't like his boss that's for sure but uh i think this guy looked like an approachable
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:37.480]  police officer he didn't look like the front bully that that jumped on hold on i'm not going to cut
[01:28:37.480 --> 01:28:42.360]  you off i want you to finish your point i hear you he just said we got a lot of gun owners got

[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:52.920]  going on so we're just using this as a focal point it's bigger than him but he might be a great guy

[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:20.440]  know spoke in washington became a national news story two weeks ago we first aired it last sunday
[01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:25.080]  but it broke last friday so about eight days ago when a listener gave us a video of a sheriff's
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:29.800]  deputy saying we need this armored tank because the constitutionalist there's a lot of guns in the
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:35.400]  county turns out it's the sheriff that's ordering him to say that he was just parroting that so yeah
[01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:42.120]  i don't want to demonize that deputy himself but the sheriff has come out and said info wars
[01:37:42.120 --> 01:37:49.560]  wants violence on police and we've got that clip and that is a bunch of bull go ahead
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:55.880]  alex uh in closing i'd like to say that the good policemen out there join oath keepers
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:38:02.200]  stop the blue wall of silence because the burly cops are going to get you killed and to the people
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:08.520]  that get stopped by by police i think they should uh meet them halfway we're in trying times if they
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:14.600]  ask for id give it to them and try to be cordial they might be cordial back to us absolutely when
[01:38:14.600 --> 01:38:19.320]  you're cordial with the police it's always a lot better i mean i've had cases just randomly
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:25.560]  where some roided up shaved head big white cop i was downtown like six seven years ago walking
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:32.200]  out of a restaurant and uh i wouldn't even look at him and the guy like looked at me he goes you
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:36.360]  looking for some trouble you want something and i was just like man this guy knows who i am he wants
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:43.080]  to beat me up and i'm just ignoring but i mean there are obviously weirdos that go get badges
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:50.600]  and the feds want that but it doesn't mean then we just hate everybody it's the same deal i mean
[01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:57.880]  almost got to this earlier i grew up in a suburb of dallas i couldn't imagine if i grew up in
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:07.080]  actual south dallas but i grew up and i would go to garland and richardson and visit friends that
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:13.960]  had moved away from rock wall and i mean i used to know it was just so bizarre i was thinking about
[01:39:13.960 --> 01:39:17.480]  the numbers the other day i said i've probably been attacked racially 20 times now it's worse than
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:25.160]  that i was probably attacked racially 20 times in the sixth grade where there were like black kids
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:30.920]  that had flunked some of them were hispanic to him i'm i'm i'm just being stereotypical that's
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:35.320]  just what happened to me i guess there were a few rednecks that had flunked two or three
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:37.960]  grades it would start fights too but that was later in high school when i got in fights with a
[01:39:37.960 --> 01:39:43.480]  bunch of rednecks but and you beat one up when they fight and then you got to fight their older
[01:39:43.480 --> 01:39:48.040]  brother and you're at a sonic and you're 16 the guy pulls up and gets out and says you know i mean
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:53.640]  college football player you put my brother in the hospital i won't kill you and like almost
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:58.200]  rips your car door off i mean that's the kind of stuff growing up in dallas i say i like the
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:01.640]  liberal culture and not getting in fights with me and macho because i grew up in dallas used to be
[01:40:01.640 --> 01:40:07.720]  the murder capital of the us and i mean let me tell you something i mean i've been in the hospital
[01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:14.520]  probably 10 times broken leg concussions broke i mean you know i mean i have been in just epic
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:21.480]  battles and especially when i was young man because i noticed the so-called minorities once
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.280]  i got bigger and older they weren't it was mainly minorities beating me up when i was in sixth seventh
[01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:31.240]  eighth and ninth grade and i mean they would just be sitting there going you little white cracker
[01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:37.080]  piece of and just you know and i learned to fight because of that and i don't then look at black
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:44.280]  people and think and hate them i mean i guarantee you eric holder hasn't been beat up 20 times in
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:51.240]  one year by black people the whining uh attorney general i mean give me a break i mean i have had
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.120]  270 pound black guy when i was like 14
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:04.520]  beating the beating me to a pulp and you know what i did i blacked out
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:10.120]  no pun intended and just started just getting really vicious and the police got there and
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:15.080]  they're like how did this kid just we're putting this guy in an ambulance i don't know i snapped
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:22.920]  i snapped and that's what happened and i snapped ever since by the way and but i am not a racist
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:27.320]  because of that i mean it's just it's unbelievable how much i've been attacked by black people i mean
[01:41:27.320 --> 01:41:35.400]  it's just over the top i mean i've got scars all over my head scar in my eyebrow uh because they
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:43.000]  were taught that i'm white i deserve to be beat up and that is exactly what's going on now
[01:41:50.760 --> 01:41:54.920]  and i just am sick of it i'm tired of it i'm tired of being accused of being a racist when all i
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:59.240]  want is freedom and for everybody to have a good life and go forward and now i see folks moving in
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:04.200]  from a louisiana and from dallas and houston into austin and man it's just what i grew up around
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:08.840]  i beat up white people every night and the politically correct police and all of them
[01:42:08.840 --> 01:42:13.080]  they just cover it up well you're gonna cover it up cops when you start getting shot in the head
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:19.880]  because you're a cop and it's all the democratic party selling race politics teaching people that
[01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:24.520]  it's okay to burn down buildings it's okay to shoot people it's okay to beat a white guy to death
[01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:31.240]  with a hammer it's okay to rape somebody because they're white it's wrong just like when the kook

[01:48:22.840 --> 01:48:31.800]  uh christine um back when i was going to school uh at a major university in oklahoma um i had some
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:39.080]  friends of mine that were from different parts of the world um uh one of my friends happened to be
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:47.720]  from pakistan and his dad happened to be uh i guess the equivalent of our fifth star general here
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:53.000]  in the united states is what his dad was what he brought back from going on vacation he came back
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:49:03.640]  with a video from a cia agent um that happened to go about describing everything that you've talked
[01:49:03.640 --> 01:49:11.960]  about you know like special like rfid chips and things like that how our movies are conditioning
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:18.360]  us to uh what's going to happen here soon uh a lot of those movies happen and be movies that
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:25.000]  Arnold Schwarzenegger was in um and i didn't believe it at all at first until all this other
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:33.320]  stuff started happening he told me that he kind of warned me that you know um the radical as long
[01:49:33.320 --> 01:49:44.520]  as this would eventually attack united states um i didn't really oh yeah the homeland security now
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:49.800]  says another as long as this 9-11 is imminent which still lets somebody attack us or whatever
[01:49:49.800 --> 01:49:56.280]  and then take more of our freedoms isn't that great yeah i just i never really had anybody
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:02.760]  to talk to about it before and when i started listening to your show it really just started
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:12.120]  hitting me and dawned on me how severe this is well your response is normal people should be
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:17.480]  really freaking out to try to stop all this i mean the president's operating as a dictator right now
[01:50:18.040 --> 01:50:24.280]  the sky's the limit we're canceling movies because north korea doesn't like them and the north korea
[01:50:24.280 --> 01:50:29.560]  denies they're doing that i mean who knows what's going on right now we know this they just passed
[01:50:29.560 --> 01:50:36.040]  the law to sign us on to unlimited derivatives bigger than the banker bailout i mean get ready
[01:50:36.040 --> 01:50:43.160]  the next shoe is about to drop folks i just it really worries me because i you know i really
[01:50:43.160 --> 01:50:48.920]  didn't i didn't understand it but fully until he said just watch and see what's going to happen he said
[01:50:49.560 --> 01:50:54.520]  all these different things are going to happen before you know it's going to get really bad and
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:51:01.160]  i i didn't i didn't understand it until then and um happened to be funny because at the time one of
[01:51:01.160 --> 01:51:09.160]  my roommates happened to be a you and diplomat son and uh he didn't quite understand it as well as
[01:51:09.160 --> 01:51:17.480]  in himself and it was it was just really i mean the most terrifying video i had ever seen well
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:25.080]  was it on youtube or was it a private video no it was a private vhs tape that his that his son
[01:51:25.080 --> 01:51:32.040]  had gotten from his office oh my god well you know i you know the general hami ghoul who was
[01:51:32.040 --> 01:51:37.640]  basically the head of the armed forces in pakistan and ran the cia operation against the russians
[01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:45.480]  he's been on the show we should try to get him back on he only comes on my show he'll go on bbc
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:50.760]  sometimes i'm not bragging it's just that he comes on because he believes my analysis is so accurate
[01:51:50.760 --> 01:51:55.720]  and that's basically what he talks about and he wants to be friends with america but he's
[01:51:55.720 --> 01:51:59.720]  explaining how al-qaeda and everything's really run by criminals in our government how they're
[01:51:59.720 --> 01:52:03.560]  going to turn them loosely stabilize the middle east he said that three years ago before it all
[01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:08.120]  happened and now you see what's happening with isis thank you for the call christine send me a copy
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:13.960]  of that vhs you got it around let's talk to christ in new york you're on the year go ahead
[01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:19.400]  hey elix good sir go ahead you say you were targeted by the nypd
[01:52:20.760 --> 01:52:26.920]  oh no no i wasn't talking about nypd i don't like to talk about the nypd they're way too aggressive
[01:52:26.920 --> 01:52:32.280]  down here in new york man especially they've been really rude to me listen i listen i the worst police
[01:52:32.280 --> 01:52:37.640]  i've seen even though a lot of them are listeners i've said is you can see it in my film marshal law
[01:52:37.640 --> 01:52:41.480]  that they would threaten to arrest me for just filming on the street and i'd say first amendment
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:47.480]  they'd say listen shut up scum i'm gonna arrest you so yes the nypd's got big problems no i'm
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:52.040]  talking about to the point if you go to down to the projects where the slums are if you go in there
[01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:57.160]  like the police is so crazy over there if you walk out of your apartment they'll come out of the
[01:52:57.160 --> 01:53:01.800]  staircase and say what are you doing here you know and you'll have flip flops out throwing
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:06.920]  out the garbage and actually a question like do you live here or something like that which is
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:10.840]  just ridiculous because you don't go out to long island next cop when he comes out of his house
[01:53:10.840 --> 01:53:15.480]  and throw out the garbage if he lives there you see what i'm saying no i hear you i hear you it's
[01:53:15.480 --> 01:53:19.400]  a sickening situation what do you what do you make of it all what do you think it's going
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:27.160]  i think it's a period somebody is up high up whoever the whoever's running the nypd is starting
[01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:31.160]  from the top down they come into the offices to act like that and they got some of these officers
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:36.280]  at juice stop too a lot of them i know this because i used to work out now it's very it's a personal
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:41.320]  affair these guys at juice stop it coming out of the van hyped up beating up young kids that look
[01:53:41.320 --> 01:53:46.920]  like dogs these kids are like paper thin you know these guys are grown men look like football players
[01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:53.640]  kicking these kids asses it's just ridiculous they got a bunch of videos online of them kicking
[01:53:53.640 --> 01:53:59.720]  everybody's ass you know and no i know and and and certainly there's some problems and it's bad
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:04.920]  and i'm the guy that's always criticizing it but you notice how they've trained them to act like
[01:54:04.920 --> 01:54:11.800]  this now there's the response it's going to cause a civil war all i'm saying is the fixes in the system
[01:54:11.800 --> 01:54:17.160]  is trying to manipulate this uh and no amount of armored vehicles or you name it is going to end up
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:22.600]  protecting the establishment i'm just saying if you don't like what's happening the target is not
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:29.160]  the cop on the beat i mean i could see people in new york carrying a gun and if somebody
[01:54:29.160 --> 01:54:33.000]  whoever they are is attacking you and killing you gotta defend yourself but randomly killing two
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:40.680]  guys in a car will then just legitimize uh the whole situation but what i'm saying is look at
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:46.280]  how the democratic party is promoting attack the police why do you think they want that
[01:54:47.160 --> 01:54:51.320]  while they're protected by them they want to create a bunch of burning cities
[01:54:51.320 --> 01:54:56.360]  as a distraction but i hear you chris could hear from you it is sickening i mean i've been in new
[01:54:56.360 --> 01:55:01.560]  york and when you see cops with their hats on sideways they weigh 300 pounds with their bellies
[01:55:01.560 --> 01:55:06.200]  hanging out smoking cigarettes what you're looking at and then you others the other cops are really
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:10.680]  nice and hey we're listeners alex how you doing it's unions that are above the law
[01:55:13.400 --> 01:55:20.280]  and then it's it's and by the way black white cops i don't care i mean they just have got
[01:55:20.280 --> 01:55:25.000]  some real pieces of work and i've had new york cops with me that i can't even understand their
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:32.200]  english their foreigners we got video why you film why you film i'm just getting a shot of
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:36.760]  wall street here i'm a you you get permit a new york doesn't give permits first amendment
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:42.840]  all right gonna kick your ass you know start pulling out the billy club it's just like whoa man
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:45.560]  i've been to third world countries cops don't act like this i get it
[01:55:45.560 --> 01:55:53.480]  i get it but patrick in pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:55:58.600]  hey thanks for taking my call alex i agree with both you and the last caller
[01:55:59.240 --> 01:56:04.200]  with regards to the two cops that were executed in new york you know it's very unfortunate maybe
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:09.480]  they did nothing wrong they certainly didn't deserve that but this type of mentality that people have
[01:56:09.480 --> 01:56:14.040]  against the cops is certainly genuine i mean these cops are getting away with murder everywhere
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:19.400]  they go look at kelly commas look at across united states what they're doing and and nothing is
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:23.880]  happening they're getting away with it and so people have this great deal of anger and they
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:28.520]  want to take it out and certainly that was unjust what happened to the people but i could
[01:56:28.520 --> 01:56:33.320]  certainly see where they're coming from number one and number two you know look at look at the union
[01:56:33.320 --> 01:56:38.760]  what they did when mayor de blasio walked into the hospital these thug cops turned around and
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:43.400]  gave him their back and that's fine you don't have to agree with the mayor or not but these cops
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:48.840]  are public servants and on your website you have someone post the comment that they were they were
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:53.640]  like total thugs like who they are they're getting taxpayer money to do a job but they don't want a
[01:56:53.640 --> 01:56:58.520]  job and quit and have someone else do it but just because they disagreed with the mayor statements
[01:56:58.520 --> 01:57:02.920]  they turned around and gave them their back and i'm thinking you know i'm glad other people feel
[01:57:02.920 --> 01:57:11.400]  the same way i do no i hear you here's the paradox uh bonjino running running for congress uh
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:17.000]  dan bonjino highly decorated secret service guy ran foreign operations he told me that new york cops
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.640]  are huge fans well i already know a bunch of new york cops that send me really good information
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:27.400]  so i'm saying is it's kind of like serpa co was a good guy i agree though they've hired a bunch of
[01:57:27.400 --> 01:57:32.680]  scum but you then here's what i'm saying there's a larger issue to get us fighting with each other
[01:57:32.680 --> 01:57:37.160]  i'm not saying people don't have a right to be mad i'm saying why does the why do the social
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:42.040]  engineers want us to just playing cops because they want to get the low level people getting the
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:47.560]  blame not the high ups getting the heat let's put the heat on them everybody have a great christmas
