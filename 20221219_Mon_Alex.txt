[00:00.000 --> 00:06.000]  It's Monday, December 19th, the year of 22nd.
[00:06.000 --> 00:08.000]  I am in Los Caballos, California.
[00:08.000 --> 00:10.000]  Massive broadcast line up for you now.
[00:15.000 --> 00:18.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[00:22.000 --> 00:26.000]  You are listening to an Infowars.com frontline report.
[00:26.000 --> 00:32.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  From deep in the heart of FEMA Region 6, Austin, Texas.
[00:44.000 --> 00:48.000]  Transmitting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:50.000 --> 00:53.000]  Like giant pools of molten magma beneath the surface.
[00:53.000 --> 00:58.000]  Humanity's great desire for liberty and freedom is striking out to the surface,
[00:58.000 --> 01:00.000]  and nothing the Neural Order can do.
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  In the end, we'll suppress our drive for liberty and freedom and justice,
[01:05.000 --> 01:09.000]  and our love of God, and our families that God gave us.
[01:09.000 --> 01:13.000]  Thank you for joining me on this live Monday broadcast.
[01:13.000 --> 01:15.000]  I'm only doing part of the broadcast today,
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.000]  because I've got to be in my personal bankruptcy court stuff coming up,
[01:19.000 --> 01:23.000]  which is going to be very, very interesting, as under penalty of perjury,
[01:23.000 --> 01:25.000]  folks find out that I have almost no money,
[01:25.000 --> 01:28.000]  contrary to the total fake news you've been hearing for years,
[01:28.000 --> 01:34.000]  that's total fraud and total lies out of the mouths of these devils that run the system.
[01:34.000 --> 01:36.000]  But that's a side issue.
[01:36.000 --> 01:40.000]  We have got a huge transmission lined up for you here.
[01:40.000 --> 01:43.000]  I'll be here for the next hour or so, then Owen's going to take over,
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  and I'll be back, host of the show, 11am to 3pm throughout the week, God willing.
[01:48.000 --> 01:50.000]  Look, I know I keep harping on the shots,
[01:50.000 --> 01:55.000]  but it's because now, coroners around the world, including the US, the UK, and Australia,
[01:55.000 --> 02:02.000]  are doing autopsies on children, and the UN, the WEF, directed under Fauci,
[02:02.000 --> 02:09.000]  really tried to get coroners not to do autopsies that's come out.
[02:09.000 --> 02:13.000]  But now it's in the news, and they're doing the autopsies,
[02:13.000 --> 02:21.000]  and even the BBC says, okay, these COVID shots are causing little kids to have heart attacks and die on a mass scale.
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  Wow, it's actually all coming out.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.000]  That is huge, huge, huge.
[02:27.000 --> 02:29.000]  Got a big stack of that.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  I mean, just every day, more prominent deaths, autopsies coming in,
[02:35.000 --> 02:40.000]  and remember, they probably do an autopsy on one in a thousand that get killed by this.
[02:40.000 --> 02:48.000]  So, the so-called unexplained deaths are now becoming explained.
[02:48.000 --> 02:52.000]  Like, print me that last article, because I've seen a bunch of those, too, where they refuse autopsies,
[02:52.000 --> 02:54.000]  and that's the big scandal.
[02:54.000 --> 02:56.000]  From the beginning, they've been censoring, they've been blocking therapeutics,
[02:56.000 --> 02:59.000]  they've been doing fake trials of the shots, that's all come out,
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  and then suppressing autopsies.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[03:04.000 --> 03:07.000]  That mother of three that was 34 years old,
[03:07.000 --> 03:12.000]  he had her mom on, a year ago, who was a nurse and took the Pfizer shot
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  and her organs liquefied in a week.
[03:15.000 --> 03:20.000]  They said, hey, let's not look at that.
[03:20.000 --> 03:22.000]  That's what's so amazing about this weapon is,
[03:22.000 --> 03:24.000]  it's designed to hit different parts to buy different people.
[03:24.000 --> 03:27.000]  So, one person gets a liquefied liver, one person gets a heart attack,
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.000]  one person gets a blood clot in the brain,
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.000]  but most folks just get sterilized,
[03:31.000 --> 03:35.000]  but it's got to be strong enough to attack the testicles and ovaries.
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  And so, the side effect is death, and they made it a little too strong,
[03:40.000 --> 03:44.000]  which, of course, they meant to do, because now they can test our response
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  and see if they're able to cover it up.
[03:46.000 --> 03:51.000]  This is the ultra, ultra, ultra hardcore information we cover
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  and why they want to stop the year and why they've got their algorithms
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  and their AI dialed down as strong as they can to suppressinfowars.com,
[03:58.000 --> 04:05.000]  Ford's last show and Band-Aid video, but that's why you, the human intelligence,
[04:05.000 --> 04:08.000]  can overpower them with brute force by sharing the link
[04:08.000 --> 04:13.000]  and saying the forbidden truth lives in infowars.com, Ford's last show,
[04:13.000 --> 04:15.000]  and Band-Aid video.
[04:15.000 --> 04:18.000]  You want to win this fight? People call in all day saying, how do we win?
[04:18.000 --> 04:20.000]  The enemy has done their analysis.
[04:20.000 --> 04:22.000]  They believe this broadcast can bring them down with our guests,
[04:22.000 --> 04:24.000]  our callers, myself, and the whole team.
[04:24.000 --> 04:27.000]  We're seen as their kryptonite.
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  But we got to move the kryptonite up against the enemy
[04:31.000 --> 04:33.000]  if we're going to be able to deal with them.
[04:33.000 --> 04:36.000]  You got to get it on them. You got to get it on them.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  You got to go up against them.
[04:38.000 --> 04:42.000]  And for 28 years, I've been on the very front lines of the fight,
[04:42.000 --> 04:45.000]  and I want to thank you all for keeping me in attack formation.
[04:45.000 --> 04:47.000]  Stay in attack formation.
[04:47.000 --> 04:49.000]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen, with massive news
[04:49.000 --> 04:52.000]  and a whole host of fronts, including the poison shots.
[04:52.000 --> 04:54.000]  Let's save lives together.
[04:54.000 --> 04:57.000]  Share the live link, infowars.com, Ford's last show.
[04:57.000 --> 05:26.000]  I'm text message and email him by word of mouth.
[05:27.000 --> 05:31.000]  40% off what these products are found for under other names.
[05:31.000 --> 05:33.000]  And not just under one name.
[05:33.000 --> 05:36.000]  They sell these under three or four other brands
[05:36.000 --> 05:39.000]  that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[05:39.000 --> 05:43.000]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[05:43.000 --> 05:45.000]  We're talking about PayneMD.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  We're talking about HGH MaxBoost.
[05:48.000 --> 05:51.000]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost.
[05:51.000 --> 05:53.000]  These things are incredible.
[05:53.000 --> 05:55.000]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less
[05:55.000 --> 05:58.000]  when you first do and consult your healthcare provider.
[05:58.000 --> 06:01.000]  Those are so powerful, get them at infowarsstore.com.
[06:01.000 --> 06:30.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  Well, the border is completely dissolved.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  Title 42 is gone.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  The Border Patrol estimates 10 million illegal aliens.
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.000]  I misspoke yesterday when I explained something.
[06:40.000 --> 06:43.000]  When I said we talked to Border Patrol whistleblowers
[06:43.000 --> 06:46.000]  earlier this year and then just a few weeks ago down at the border,
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  they said they estimated 10 million would come across
[06:50.000 --> 06:52.000]  the Texas sector alone.
[06:52.000 --> 06:54.000]  Excuse me.
[06:54.000 --> 06:56.000]  The estimates are another five to six million
[06:56.000 --> 06:58.000]  in the other sectors put together.
[06:58.000 --> 07:00.000]  Arizona, California, you name it.
[07:00.000 --> 07:02.000]  Video.
[07:02.000 --> 07:04.000]  Senior advisors can't say why Biden hasn't visited border.
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  Democrats dismiss crisis at the national level,
[07:07.000 --> 07:09.000]  but not at the local level.
[07:09.000 --> 07:11.000]  We are in urgent need for help.
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.000]  New York City Mayor starts freaking out over impending wave
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  of illegal aliens.
[07:16.000 --> 07:18.000]  Same thing in El Paso, same thing in Denver.
[07:18.000 --> 07:20.000]  Same thing in Chicago.
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  Same thing all over the place.
[07:22.000 --> 07:24.000]  And the good news.
[07:24.000 --> 07:26.000]  Texas Governor Abbott seeks criminal probe
[07:26.000 --> 07:29.000]  of the UN NGOs aiding illegal immigrants crossing the border
[07:29.000 --> 07:32.000]  that are actually in charge of the Border Patrol.
[07:32.000 --> 07:34.000]  We've been spotlighting that and spotlighting it hard.
[07:34.000 --> 07:37.000]  The same European NGO that ran the open borders
[07:37.000 --> 07:40.000]  the last decade in Europe was hired two years ago
[07:40.000 --> 07:42.000]  about a year and a half ago by Biden.
[07:42.000 --> 07:45.000]  Absolutely insane.
[07:45.000 --> 07:48.000]  He'll be drilling more into that.
[07:48.000 --> 07:51.000]  Huge Russia escalation news.
[07:51.000 --> 07:53.000]  Kissinger is saying it's time for a negotiated peace in Ukraine
[07:53.000 --> 07:56.000]  to avoid a nuclear war that is becoming imminent.
[07:56.000 --> 08:00.000]  Also, we've got the big Elon Musk Twitter situation.
[08:00.000 --> 08:03.000]  Look, I know it's interesting like a big soap opera
[08:03.000 --> 08:05.000]  to see who's let back on and who isn't
[08:05.000 --> 08:07.000]  and to constantly talk about Elon Musk all day,
[08:07.000 --> 08:09.000]  but at the end of the day, it is a big distraction
[08:09.000 --> 08:11.000]  from all the giant events going on.
[08:11.000 --> 08:15.000]  And so, I saw it right when the poll went live last night.
[08:15.000 --> 08:17.000]  Right as I was going off air,
[08:17.000 --> 08:19.000]  handing the baton to Owen Shroyer, I saw the poll go live.
[08:19.000 --> 08:23.000]  It only had like 20,000 votes, got like 18 million last time I checked.
[08:23.000 --> 08:25.000]  It had just gone live.
[08:25.000 --> 08:27.000]  Twitter wide poll saying,
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  do you want me to step down as CEO?
[08:29.000 --> 08:32.000]  And if you vote, I will abide by what you want.
[08:32.000 --> 08:34.000]  Well, he knew they were going to use bots.
[08:34.000 --> 08:36.000]  He knew they were going to do whatever they wanted.
[08:36.000 --> 08:38.000]  And he knows Twitter is mainly leftist.
[08:38.000 --> 08:40.000]  So, he obviously already has his CEO lined up.
[08:40.000 --> 08:43.000]  I walked in here and told Owen about it and said, watch.
[08:43.000 --> 08:45.000]  He'll probably tweet soon that, but don't worry,
[08:45.000 --> 08:47.000]  he's got a new CEO.
[08:47.000 --> 08:51.000]  He loves those little jokes to watch them celebrate and then say,
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  yeah, I'm not going to officially be doing this.
[08:53.000 --> 08:55.000]  I've got other things like space programs to run
[08:55.000 --> 08:59.000]  and brain implant chips and electric cars and flamethrowers
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  and, you know, everything else.
[09:01.000 --> 09:03.000]  And sure enough, five minutes later, he tweets,
[09:03.000 --> 09:07.000]  I don't worry, look out what you wish for to be a new CEO.
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  Ha, ha, ha, ha.
[09:09.000 --> 09:11.000]  So, he's beyond a mega troll.
[09:11.000 --> 09:13.000]  I don't know why I've been called a troll.
[09:13.000 --> 09:15.000]  I'm not trying to troll the globalist.
[09:15.000 --> 09:17.000]  I'm trying to confront them and expose them,
[09:17.000 --> 09:20.000]  but Musk really plans all this out.
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  Really creepy watching him hang out with Jared Kushner, though.
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  And so, at the big soccer game, speaking of that,
[09:26.000 --> 09:29.000]  Argentina beat France, of course,
[09:29.000 --> 09:32.000]  and the U.S. media, CNN, Washington Post, others,
[09:32.000 --> 09:37.000]  said it was racist that the team was white and brown
[09:37.000 --> 09:39.000]  and there were no black players.
[09:39.000 --> 09:42.000]  We watched an NFL game where some of them are 90% black.
[09:42.000 --> 09:44.000]  Nobody gets mad about that.
[09:44.000 --> 09:46.000]  It was a country. Believe me, they had black players there
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  that were better. They'd be on the team.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  They just beat, basically, an all-black team.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  But the whole point is, what is it at to do with it?
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  They're just projecting race on...
[09:56.000 --> 09:58.000]  to everything for divide and conquer,
[09:58.000 --> 10:01.000]  but I do find it hilarious that Argentina then won.
[10:01.000 --> 10:03.000]  So, that's a very, very interesting...
[10:03.000 --> 10:05.000]  I know, in short, he's a big Argentina fan,
[10:05.000 --> 10:08.000]  so he was really, really excited yesterday.
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  But when we see an all-black team from France,
[10:12.000 --> 10:14.000]  why is the whole team black from France?
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  Well, in France, they've got a giant African population there
[10:17.000 --> 10:20.000]  and they are, overall, the best soccer players
[10:20.000 --> 10:22.000]  according to the free market.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  And there's a bunch of good soccer players that are in Argentina
[10:25.000 --> 10:27.000]  because they like their country and they don't want to move
[10:27.000 --> 10:29.000]  somewhere else, so they've got a home team that happens
[10:29.000 --> 10:31.000]  to be brown and white. Big deal, but just the idea
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  of white people existing as evil,
[10:33.000 --> 10:36.000]  that is the race-based system of the ADL and the New World Order.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  And really, they show their ass how they're the ones
[10:38.000 --> 10:43.000]  promoting racial division and control through that racial division.
[10:43.000 --> 10:46.000]  And then, of course, we have massive vaccine news,
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.000]  and I keep saying the biggest shit, the biggest shit,
[10:48.000 --> 10:50.000]  because every day, bigger shoes drop,
[10:50.000 --> 10:52.000]  more information comes out.
[10:52.000 --> 10:55.000]  Suddenly, governments and others are doing autopsies.
[10:55.000 --> 10:57.000]  Despite the fact that UNWF said,
[10:57.000 --> 10:58.000]  don't do them,
[10:58.000 --> 11:00.000]  of the children and others dying of heart attacks
[11:00.000 --> 11:03.000]  and blood clots, and surprise, surprise,
[11:03.000 --> 11:06.000]  it's not regular blood clots, it's protein blobs
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  of the spike protein growing and replicating
[11:09.000 --> 11:14.000]  and creating sludge that kills you better than a hammer.
[11:17.000 --> 11:20.000]  Absolutely incredible.
[11:20.000 --> 11:23.000]  We're gonna be getting to that, actually, next segment
[11:23.000 --> 11:26.000]  and playing those clips because this is really
[11:26.000 --> 11:29.000]  the end of the system if all this comes out,
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  and it is coming out.
[11:31.000 --> 11:33.000]  We've got some new FTX news.
[11:33.000 --> 11:35.000]  You know, these new JFK documents have come out
[11:35.000 --> 11:37.000]  showing the government had CIA involvement.
[11:37.000 --> 11:38.000]  Of course, they did.
[11:38.000 --> 11:43.000]  I interviewed the head of the operation before he died.
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  We played the interview with E. Howard Hunt
[11:46.000 --> 11:48.000]  that his son got.
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  I interviewed a lot of the other people who were involved,
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  and it's well-known.
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  All of this is extremely well-known
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  of who the hit team was.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  But before he died, he gave the deathbed confession,
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  and then, of course, we also have
[12:06.000 --> 12:09.000]  the famous admitted mistress of JFK
[12:09.000 --> 12:12.000]  who I interviewed weeks before she died,
[12:12.000 --> 12:13.000]  but she was all there when she died.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  She had heart problems.
[12:15.000 --> 12:20.000]  She lived at the Driscoll with LBJ for years,
[12:20.000 --> 12:22.000]  for over 20 years.
[12:22.000 --> 12:23.000]  She was his Austin mistress.
[12:23.000 --> 12:25.000]  He had other ones in D.C.
[12:25.000 --> 12:27.000]  And she's on record being his mistress,
[12:27.000 --> 12:30.000]  and she said that he came in and said,
[12:30.000 --> 12:32.000]  I'll never do all that son of a bitch anymore next week
[12:32.000 --> 12:33.000]  when he comes to Texas.
[12:33.000 --> 12:35.000]  We're going to kill his ass in Dallas.
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.000]  He came in happy as a clam a few days later
[12:38.000 --> 12:41.000]  and said, yep, took out that son of a bitch.
[12:41.000 --> 12:44.000]  So, I mean, I've interviewed the woman in the bedroom with him.
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  They had a son with him.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  I've interviewed the famous CIA hitman who was in Dallas.
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  I mean, it's on record.
[12:51.000 --> 12:54.000]  So we're going to be getting into that as well.
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  I mean, the national polls, 92% of Americans
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  know the government killed Kennedy.
[12:58.000 --> 13:00.000]  So the epic time says, as American democracy
[13:00.000 --> 13:02.000]  but in hallucination, nearly 60 years.
[13:02.000 --> 13:05.000]  And the answer is, yeah, that was their beach head.
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  But now the globalists have got pretty much full control.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  And you see their mission, wreck and destroy the country.
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  But again, ladies and gentlemen, we are tomorrow's news today.
[13:14.000 --> 13:16.000]  Now, let me make a little announcement here.
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  And it gets a lot of the complex behind the scenes things
[13:19.000 --> 13:20.000]  and all the rest of it.
[13:20.000 --> 13:23.000]  But Info Wars, because supply chain breakdowns
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  and lawsuits and issues and attacks
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  has been off and on the red the last few years.
[13:29.000 --> 13:32.000]  And we also have had a lot of problems getting the products in.
[13:32.000 --> 13:35.000]  But we finally put everything forward, everything we could do
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  and got a lot of great products to finally come in.
[13:37.000 --> 13:39.000]  And then if folks just simply get the great products,
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  because I know a lot of folks couldn't get the products
[13:41.000 --> 13:42.000]  for a long time because they weren't there,
[13:42.000 --> 13:44.000]  if all the great folks that were getting these great products
[13:44.000 --> 13:47.000]  come back and get them again, we'll be able to continue to operate,
[13:47.000 --> 13:50.000]  appeal all these fake lawsuits and stay on the air for years
[13:50.000 --> 13:53.000]  and years and years just in this current incarnation.
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.000]  But if you don't support, and I'm not complaining,
[13:56.000 --> 13:58.000]  it's up to you, we will not be here.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  I need everybody to go to infowarstore.com
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  and finish up any Christmas shopping
[14:02.000 --> 14:04.000]  and give yourself the gift of health and life.
[14:04.000 --> 14:06.000]  We have the new Info Wars MD line.
[14:06.000 --> 14:08.000]  There's a whole bunch of already bestselling products,
[14:08.000 --> 14:09.000]  some of them number one bestsellers,
[14:09.000 --> 14:12.000]  from the top distributor and manufacturer
[14:12.000 --> 14:14.000]  that we were already getting a lot of our supplies from
[14:14.000 --> 14:17.000]  to make the supplements and other big supplement companies.
[14:17.000 --> 14:21.000]  But we've gone right to the source with Info Wars MD.
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  Now that we're selling out,
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  they already sold out of one of their CBDs.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  These are super high quality, great CBDs that have none of the stuff in it
[14:29.000 --> 14:32.000]  that gets you high, there's none of the THC in it.
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  It's only the good plant oils that are just magic basically
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  and do so much for inflammation, your brain, pain, you name it.
[14:40.000 --> 14:42.000]  You've not tried CBD, this is a great CBD.
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  They have 25 milligram gummies and 1,000 milligram liquid drip.
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  We just take one drop out of the tongue at infowarstore.com
[14:52.000 --> 14:55.000]  massively discounted, you're paying for these CBD oils
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  around 40% off what they're sold in stores.
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  Most people sell 1,000 milligram liquid drop, full spectrum, pure CBD
[15:05.000 --> 15:10.000]  for $150 retail, $100 on sale.
[15:10.000 --> 15:14.000]  Well, this is $55.
[15:14.000 --> 15:19.000]  So do the math here and understand we're only making a little bit of money off of this
[15:19.000 --> 15:22.000]  but we believe in you when you get a lot of great products
[15:22.000 --> 15:24.000]  so you like it and buy from us over and over again.
[15:24.000 --> 15:26.000]  Now, Andy, I'm wrong, maybe I should sell for $100
[15:26.000 --> 15:28.000]  and in the sales we do get with fun things
[15:28.000 --> 15:30.000]  but I just like to bring you a good deal.
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  So you have the CBD gummies and you have a CBD liquid that's super strong,

[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  but we have the turmeric 95 ready to ship right now.

[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  that doesn't use stimulants but does create an incredibly clean,

[17:11.000 --> 17:17.000]  and I almost forgot you save at least 50% on these products for what you pay
[17:17.000 --> 17:21.000]  for similar products or the exact same products in stores around the country.
[17:21.000 --> 17:24.000]  That's because we go right to the highest quality manufacturer in the nation
[17:24.000 --> 17:26.000]  that supplies some of the top names.
[17:26.000 --> 17:29.000]  They then give us the best deal out there because the owner is a listener
[17:29.000 --> 17:32.000]  and we're able to bring it to you with massive discounts.
[17:32.000 --> 17:37.000]  You're not going to find 1000 milligram high quality CBD for anywhere near the price we sell it.
[17:37.000 --> 17:39.000]  You're not going to find it at the 10 milligram or the 20 milligram.
[17:39.000 --> 17:43.000]  You're not going to find tumor at 95% or humanoid at the price we're selling it.
[17:43.000 --> 17:45.000]  You're not going to find any of this anywhere near that.
[17:45.000 --> 17:51.000]  These similar formulas or the same formulas shell for up to 200% more than we're selling these.
[17:51.000 --> 17:58.000]  Info Wars MD, now available exclusively at infowarstore.com, a true 360 win.
[17:59.000 --> 18:03.000]  Once a tragedy reaches a level of national significance,
[18:03.000 --> 18:11.000]  American citizens should be allowed to basically question that event in any way that they deem fit.
[18:11.000 --> 18:13.000]  The First Amendment is unique in the world.
[18:13.000 --> 18:16.000]  That's what they want to take away, your ability to speak freely.
[18:16.000 --> 18:19.000]  So they're going to go for Mike Lindell next, or they're going to go for Steve Bannon,
[18:19.000 --> 18:20.000]  or they're going to go for Tucker Carlson.
[18:20.000 --> 18:24.000]  I studied the globalist 30 years ago, but on air 28 years,
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  and I knew they were planning all of this, and I warned the public as a modern Paul Revere.
[18:28.000 --> 18:30.000]  But I couldn't have done it without your support.
[18:30.000 --> 18:33.000]  And now because we've been so successful warning the population of the planet,
[18:33.000 --> 18:37.000]  not just America, we're public enemy number one when it comes to the globalist agenda.
[18:37.000 --> 18:43.000]  That's why it's more important than ever to realize how successful Info Wars has been because of your past support.
[18:43.000 --> 18:45.000]  So I salute you and I thank you, and I ask you now,

[18:59.000 --> 19:05.000]  Climb to the top of the food chain with alpha power by Info Wars Life.
[19:05.000 --> 19:09.000]  For those who want to increase testosterone and energy levels,
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  most men know that testosterone levels begin to decline,
[19:13.000 --> 19:17.000]  starting around 30 at a rate of about 1-2% per year.
[19:17.000 --> 19:24.000]  This drop can show signs such as fatigue, low energy, low sex drive, and muscle loss.
[19:24.000 --> 19:30.000]  Alpha power is packed with some of the most potent and clinically tested ingredients on the market.

[19:40.000 --> 19:43.000]  uricoma longifolia, originally from Malaysia,
[19:43.000 --> 19:45.000]  makaroo from Peru,
[19:45.000 --> 19:47.000]  horny goatweed from China,

[20:01.000 --> 20:14.000]  Leading up frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show.
[20:16.000 --> 20:21.000]  Remember when I cover this stack of news, these are real people that are dying.
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  These are real people that are sick.
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  These are a lot of people you personally know.
[20:25.000 --> 20:28.000]  When we open the phones up, and I'm going to do it again later this week,
[20:28.000 --> 20:30.000]  we can take three, four hours at calls,
[20:30.000 --> 20:33.000]  and nobody calls in and had good experiences with the poison shots,
[20:33.000 --> 20:36.000]  and the stories they tell aren't just anecdotal,
[20:36.000 --> 20:40.000]  it's in the global statistics from the insurance companies and governments.
[20:40.000 --> 20:45.000]  And now it's coming out that Fauci and the UN and the W.E.F. went in and said,
[20:45.000 --> 20:50.000]  don't do autopsies when these people drop dead of heart attacks and blood clots.
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.000]  So folks on Twitter asked the question,
[20:53.000 --> 20:56.000]  the vaccine doesn't stop transmission and it doesn't prevent infection,
[20:56.000 --> 20:58.000]  so what does it do?
[20:58.000 --> 21:02.000]  That's all admitted fact right now, but look at the latest articles.
[21:02.000 --> 21:03.000]  I see them everywhere.
[21:03.000 --> 21:12.000]  New York Times, why those that took the shot died at a lesser rate than those that did.
[21:12.000 --> 21:18.000]  Those that took the shot had a lower rate of death than those that didn't take it.
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  That's just not true, just like they lied about crime statistics this year,
[21:22.000 --> 21:28.000]  and said crimes down 2% nationwide from two years ago.
[21:28.000 --> 21:33.000]  It's up massively, but they just didn't count 800 plus cities and towns.
[21:33.000 --> 21:37.000]  They cut out where all the crimes exploded, and then said no crime there,
[21:37.000 --> 21:42.000]  so obviously it went down because they weren't even averaging in where most of the crime is.
[21:42.000 --> 21:45.000]  But they think you're stupid.
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  And it just continues on with Biden saying there is no border problem.
[21:50.000 --> 21:52.000]  So here's some of the headlines.
[21:52.000 --> 22:00.000]  This is the BBC of all places admitting COVID.
[22:00.000 --> 22:07.000]  Jack last died as a result of AstraZeneca vaccine says the coroner.
[22:07.000 --> 22:12.000]  Direct result of AstraZeneca COVID jab because they all create spike protein,
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  not just the mRNA.
[22:16.000 --> 22:19.000]  He died just weeks after he took the shot.
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  Okay, that's just today.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  I didn't like go back and pull these up.
[22:23.000 --> 22:24.000]  This is just latest news.
[22:24.000 --> 22:25.000]  Here's a clip.
[22:25.000 --> 22:28.000]  Eight-year-old boy develops microcarditis after his second vaccine.
[22:28.000 --> 22:30.000]  The doctors admit.
[22:30.000 --> 22:32.000]  So here's the key.
[22:32.000 --> 22:33.000]  We've known this free.
[22:33.000 --> 22:35.000]  It's just before they even gave the shots.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  The CDC documents predicted it, but now the mainstream media is reporting it.
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  Go ahead and roll that clip.
[22:41.000 --> 22:46.000]  A second grid in Gauchon develop a fever and chest pain after getting a second
[22:46.000 --> 22:49.000]  maternal dose on June 17th.
[22:49.000 --> 22:54.000]  Doctors say the boy had microcarditis that may have been triggered by the vaccine.
[22:54.000 --> 22:57.000]  The boy is in stable condition after treatment.
[22:57.000 --> 23:03.000]  Meanwhile, a 68-year-old jiayi resident died just hours after getting his fourth
[23:03.000 --> 23:04.000]  maternal shot.
[23:04.000 --> 23:09.000]  Whether the two incidents are related remains to be clarified.
[23:09.000 --> 23:15.000]  Taiwan began administering second maternal doses to children between 6 and 11 on June 17th.
[23:15.000 --> 23:20.000]  In Gauchon, a boy developed a fever and chest pain two days after getting his second shot.
[23:20.000 --> 23:21.000]  Okay, that's enough.
[23:21.000 --> 23:22.000]  I'm not going to go into the rest of it.
[23:22.000 --> 23:24.000]  So we have millions and millions of deaths.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  The conservative estimates 10 million.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  The big estimates 20 million dead.
[23:28.000 --> 23:29.000]  That's the short term.
[23:29.000 --> 23:34.000]  But we know around one in 40 to one in 100 deaths or adverse reactions even get reported
[23:34.000 --> 23:35.000]  to the VAERS.
[23:35.000 --> 23:38.000]  It's similar around the world, but you heard the big lie there.
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.000]  He's fine now.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  He's out of the hospital.
[23:41.000 --> 23:51.000]  It causes massive heart scarring and normal children that get rare viral microcarditis
[23:51.000 --> 23:52.000]  from a virus.
[23:52.000 --> 23:54.000]  You can get it from, you know, the flu of cold.
[23:54.000 --> 23:55.000]  It's very rare.
[23:55.000 --> 24:00.000]  Half of them are dead within a year.
[24:00.000 --> 24:03.000]  Did you hear me there?
[24:03.000 --> 24:11.000]  So think about that and there's a lot of evidence showing that this is the worst form of microcarditis,
[24:11.000 --> 24:15.000]  because the spike protein has the viral effect in the heart.
[24:15.000 --> 24:19.000]  So a lot of these children that are getting microcarditis are going to be dead very soon.
[24:19.000 --> 24:20.000]  And I forget the exact statistic.
[24:20.000 --> 24:23.000]  I think it's within five years, something like 69%.
[24:23.000 --> 24:24.000]  You can pull it up.
[24:24.000 --> 24:25.000]  I've had Dr. Mercolon.
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  We've shown the studies at Nausium.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  Just look up what I'm saying.
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  The percentage of young people, children that die after microcarditis.
[24:33.000 --> 24:37.000]  Because you usually live, they do stuff like heart ablation where they literally cauterize
[24:37.000 --> 24:38.000]  out the heart and stuff.
[24:38.000 --> 24:40.000]  I mean, you can't run.
[24:40.000 --> 24:41.000]  You can't jog.
[24:41.000 --> 24:45.000]  You have like a heart of an 80-year-old person.
[24:45.000 --> 24:48.000]  Think about how sick that is.
[24:48.000 --> 24:52.000]  You're like, oh, the boy had microcarditis in the shop, but he's fine now.
[24:52.000 --> 24:56.000]  Yeah, he's really fine right now.
[24:56.000 --> 25:02.000]  Here is Dr. Mercolon and another scientist talking about how Fauci told the government.
[25:02.000 --> 25:07.000]  This is a government official we're talking to with Dr. Mercolon to not do autopsies.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  Here it is.
[25:08.000 --> 25:10.000]  So what's happened to the autopsy?
[25:10.000 --> 25:11.000]  Right.
[25:11.000 --> 25:21.000]  Well, Anthony Fauci told our government to tell people don't do autopsies on COVID patients.
[25:21.000 --> 25:29.000]  You cannot find that for which you do not look.
[25:29.000 --> 25:40.000]  I have a post-vaccine nine-year-old on my desk, dead.
[25:40.000 --> 25:46.000]  I don't want to see one more child post-vaccine ever on my desk.
[25:46.000 --> 25:48.000]  Are the autopsies starting to happen?
[25:48.000 --> 25:53.000]  Yeah, they are, finally, because people are saying, well, why wouldn't we do them?
[25:53.000 --> 26:01.000]  And in that same town from which this nine-year-old died, a healthy 22-year-old wrestler after
[26:01.000 --> 26:09.000]  his third shot is now also coming to be on my desk so I can determine the cause of death there.
[26:09.000 --> 26:12.000]  We were told, don't do autopsies.
[26:12.000 --> 26:14.000]  Don't look.
[26:14.000 --> 26:17.000]  And that's what your government is giving you for data.
[26:17.000 --> 26:18.000]  Don't ask.
[26:18.000 --> 26:19.000]  Don't tell.
[26:19.000 --> 26:20.000]  Don't look.
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  These are not the droids you're looking for.
[26:22.000 --> 26:23.000]  Everything is safe and effective.
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.000]  Go jab up the children with a shot that doesn't work for a virus that isn't here anymore for
[26:29.000 --> 26:35.000]  a virus that most of them are already recovered from.
[26:35.000 --> 26:38.000]  Safe and effective.
[26:38.000 --> 26:40.000]  Don't do science.
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  Don't ask a question.
[26:43.000 --> 26:49.000]  Destroy the careers of those that do ask a question that are only in it for humanity.
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  Ballad questions to ask yourself.
[26:52.000 --> 26:54.000]  Premeditated mass murder.
[26:54.000 --> 26:56.000]  There's Ernest Ramirez.
[26:56.000 --> 27:04.000]  His son didn't drink, didn't smoke pot, played basketball, was skinny.
[27:04.000 --> 27:14.000]  He took the Pfizer shot and a week later was playing basketball with his father and friends
[27:14.000 --> 27:18.000]  and dropped dead.
[27:18.000 --> 27:22.000]  He wanted an autopsy and he said, no, you don't want that.
[27:22.000 --> 27:24.000]  Dropped dead.
[27:24.000 --> 27:26.000]  No heart defects, no nothing.
[27:26.000 --> 27:28.000]  Dead.
[27:28.000 --> 27:30.000]  That was over a year ago when the murder continues.
[27:30.000 --> 27:32.000]  Now they're going after the newborn babies.
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  Only the U.S. is authorized six months old and up, but now they're going after the newborn babies
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  and of course shooting up the pregnant women.
[27:39.000 --> 27:46.000]  Here is super successful IT computer engineer inventor with tens of billions of dollars of sales
[27:46.000 --> 27:48.000]  of his inventions.
[27:48.000 --> 27:50.000]  That's really what he is, a prominent scientist.
[27:50.000 --> 27:54.000]  But journalist, turned journalist, Steve Kirsch, testifying.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  So you killed 150,000.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  That's a very low statistic of what's in VAERS in order to maybe save 10,000 lives.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  And that's if the actual variant matched the vaccine, which it doesn't.
[28:05.000 --> 28:12.000]  So in other words, and for kids, by the way, the risk benefit is even worse.
[28:12.000 --> 28:18.000]  We kill 117 kids to save one life.
[28:18.000 --> 28:22.000]  Because everybody is focused, laser-frozen.
[28:22.000 --> 28:31.000]  How many lives can we save from COVID?
[28:31.000 --> 28:35.000]  And they're not focused on how many people actually die from the vaccine.
[28:35.000 --> 28:39.000]  Because it's all covered up because the doctors aren't allowed to talk about it
[28:39.000 --> 28:44.000]  because they will lose their license or they will be fired if they talk about it.
[28:44.000 --> 28:45.000]  Bingo.
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  And that's what's happening is they don't care anymore.
[28:47.000 --> 28:48.000]  And the dam's breaking.
[28:48.000 --> 28:49.000]  The autopsies are coming out.
[28:49.000 --> 28:53.000]  So thanks to all of you pushing and exposing and speaking out, we're starting to win.
[28:53.000 --> 28:54.000]  And now we can save a lot of lives.
[28:54.000 --> 28:57.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[28:57.000 --> 29:00.000]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school.
[29:00.000 --> 29:01.000]  And they had great effects.
[29:01.000 --> 29:05.000]  And the science has gotten better and better and better over the years.
[29:05.000 --> 29:09.000]  And now with all the things we're bombarded with, and the water and the food
[29:09.000 --> 29:14.000]  and the feminizing factors, it is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us
[29:14.000 --> 29:16.000]  to boost our natural male potential.
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.000]  But these products work great for women as well.
[29:20.000 --> 29:23.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, we have Pain MD.
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  It's the number one natural best seller under another name.
[29:25.000 --> 29:31.000]  We got it discounted for 40% off infowarestore.com under the label InfoWars Platinum.

[29:33.000 --> 29:34.000]  Read all about it.
[29:34.000 --> 29:36.000]  Be very safe with it.
[29:36.000 --> 29:39.000]  I take only a fraction of what they say at first and take it before you go to bed at night.
[29:39.000 --> 29:41.000]  Don't do it during the day.
[29:41.000 --> 29:44.000]  1776 testosterone boost.
[29:44.000 --> 29:45.000]  Totally incredible.

[30:16.000 --> 30:17.000]  we were already using.

[32:56.000 --> 33:22.000]  We love you and we thank you for your support.
[33:22.000 --> 33:48.000]  We love you and we thank you for your support.
[33:48.000 --> 34:14.000]  We love you and we thank you for your support.
[34:14.000 --> 34:40.000]  We love you and we thank you for your support.
[34:40.000 --> 35:08.000]  We love you and we thank you for your support.
[35:08.000 --> 35:34.000]  We love you and we thank you for your support.
[35:34.000 --> 36:02.000]  We love you and we thank you for your support.
[36:02.000 --> 36:28.000]  We love you and we thank you for your support.
[36:28.000 --> 36:32.000]  Now I had the idea for this product six years ago.
[36:32.000 --> 36:35.000]  And I had it manufactured and it was not popular.
[36:35.000 --> 36:44.000]  But slowly as people began, a few people to order it and try it, their word of mouth made it our number three best seller because it worked so good.
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  And then some of the proprietary things in it we couldn't get anymore because of the lab we were using.
[36:49.000 --> 36:58.000]  And I went in for my yearly checkup, got blood drawn, all that, and I said, what is this brochure you've given me?
[36:58.000 --> 37:04.000]  And medical doctor owns and runs a big clinic who is a listener.
[37:04.000 --> 37:06.000]  He said, well, this is a prescription.
[37:06.000 --> 37:11.000]  But he said, this formula we found really makes people lose weight.
[37:11.000 --> 37:15.000]  It really does great things to counter aging.
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  And it's so good for the whole body and the immune system.
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  And I said, wow.
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.000]  So I went to a big firm and I said, I want to clone this, but make it better.
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  And that's what real red pill is.
[37:26.000 --> 37:29.000]  And folks, I need to get back to the news, but let me tell you what's in this.
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  Been gone for two years, real red pill plus.
[37:32.000 --> 37:34.000]  It's got everything in it.
[37:34.000 --> 37:42.000]  But the big thing is the high quality preglinone that is the basis for all the hormones in a man or woman that people get depleted.
[37:42.000 --> 37:44.000]  So the body can't even make its natural hormones.
[37:44.000 --> 37:49.000]  So this is the precursor your body needs to have healthy hormones.
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  As you get older, you lose the preglinone.
[37:51.000 --> 37:52.000]  Well, this adds it.
[37:52.000 --> 38:01.000]  Beetroot, vital nutrients like niacin, folate, calcium, magnesium and zinc, vitamin K, B6 and 12.
[38:01.000 --> 38:10.000]  It's got a clean energy boosting formula with L-theanin, C-O bromine, green tea extract and Yerba mate leaf extract and many more.
[38:10.000 --> 38:17.000]  Real red pill formula supports the body through supporting healthy aging, supporting hormone production, supporting endocrine health,
[38:17.000 --> 38:24.000]  helping to support mental sharpness and mental clarity and containing essential trace minerals such as B vitamins.
[38:24.000 --> 38:25.000]  And that's only part of what's in it.
[38:25.000 --> 38:34.000]  This is a multi-vitamin, multi-mineral with a whole bunch of super high-end nutraceuticals in it that you need.
[38:34.000 --> 38:40.000]  It is finally back and it's 50% off because we need funds right now.
[38:40.000 --> 38:45.000]  The real red pill plus, finally back at infowarstore.com.
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  I know people are going to be extremely excited about that because it was so incredibly popular.
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.000]  That's part of the reason we've gotten into financial trouble was supply chain breakdowns and other issues.
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  The products everybody liked were just gone for years.
[39:00.000 --> 39:04.000]  And so they're like, no, I don't like this other product. I don't want that.
[39:04.000 --> 39:10.000]  Well, we finally got a big lab to make it and it is the original formula.
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.000]  So I told you we got the connections now and it's all triple tested and super high rated.
[39:14.000 --> 39:21.000]  But this is an original proprietary enforced product where we took what's sold in medical offices and upgraded it even better.
[39:21.000 --> 39:26.000]  And I tell you, the bottle of that stuff I bought from that doctor's office was $100.
[39:26.000 --> 39:30.000]  This is a fraction of that.
[39:30.000 --> 39:32.000]  And it's jam packed. Look at this.
[39:32.000 --> 39:38.000]  You open this up, TV viewers, and it is just filled.
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.000]  You know, you go to the store, you see the mushroom max we sell.
[39:42.000 --> 39:45.000]  Another big brand name sells a very similar mushroom system than we do.
[39:45.000 --> 39:50.000]  But ours has three times the pills in it than what the leading brand does and they sell it for the same price.
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  Look at this. Look at this.
[39:52.000 --> 39:57.000]  The sucker is full to the top.
[39:57.000 --> 40:02.000]  And nobody's got something like this except for a medical offices.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  So that's your real red pill plus.
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  We're doing a fundraiser. We need to stay on air.
[40:06.000 --> 40:09.000]  We are treading water, but we've got a big plan.
[40:09.000 --> 40:12.000]  And I told you, t-shirts are all going to sell out.
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  But we got t-shirts coming back in next year.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  We got a bunch of other stuff. We got x2, x2 coming back.
[40:16.000 --> 40:19.000]  We're online, but just barely.
[40:19.000 --> 40:25.000]  So we need you to support us at infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three.
[40:25.000 --> 40:28.000]  And I want to thank all you that have supported us.
[40:28.000 --> 40:33.000]  I'm going to dump this all over the table. It's on top of my news articles now.
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.000]  I just want to show you how much is in here.
[40:37.000 --> 40:46.000]  And it's the same thing with the info wars platinum products that are clones of three top national bestsellers put out by a pharmaceutical company.
[40:46.000 --> 40:55.000]  The HTH max, the testosterone 1776 moves to the pain MD are all absolutely amazing and are very strong.
[40:55.000 --> 41:01.000]  So I would suggest you not take the full dose the first time of any of these because it's that good.
[41:01.000 --> 41:10.000]  It's that strong. And I really got mad at myself when real red pill came back in last week that if you remember about six years ago,
[41:10.000 --> 41:17.000]  I lost a ton of weight, like 60 pounds, and I gained half of a bag. And it was because I was remembered to take everything, including the real red pill.
[41:17.000 --> 41:23.000]  And then when it sold out a few years ago, and I kind of just didn't get to have to take it anymore because I'm not a big pill guy.
[41:23.000 --> 41:28.000]  I gained some of the weight back, but I'm going right back on it today.
[41:28.000 --> 41:32.000]  And you're going to see the dramatic. I'm going to take my x2 out of the mineral fusion.
[41:32.000 --> 41:40.000]  I'm going to take my DNA force. I'm going to take my real red pill as adulterated as the food and the supply as it's so important to supplement.
[41:40.000 --> 41:47.000]  And what it does for the mind is so important as well, especially all the stuff going on, you want to give your immune system everything you can do.
[41:47.000 --> 41:53.000]  And the real red pill is that infowarstore.com or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[41:53.000 --> 42:04.000]  Okay. Don't plug it. I'm going to come back here in a few minutes and I am going to go through all of it in a giant news blitz straight ahead on Twitter.
[42:04.000 --> 42:12.000]  Elon Musk, what happened with Argentina and their soccer team? The New York Times in a crossword puzzle for Hanukkah with a swastika on it.
[42:12.000 --> 42:22.000]  Why do they do that? We'll explain it. We're also going to get into the situation unfolding in Ukraine and how serious that is in the latest developments.
[42:22.000 --> 42:29.000]  There are five Antifa protesters in Atlanta held on terrorism charges after police find bombs, flares and weapons in their camp.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  What are they gearing up for? What's getting ready?
[42:31.000 --> 42:37.000]  The January 6 kangaroo panel is set to come out and call for Trump to be indicted today.
[42:37.000 --> 42:48.000]  That is all coming up and more, but the good news is the people are waking up on a mass scale and the people now know these shots are poisoned
[42:48.000 --> 42:52.000]  and now doctors have the courage and the cover to come out and tell the truth.
[42:52.000 --> 42:56.000]  And so the New World Order is in a lot of trouble, but they got tricks up their sleeves.
[42:56.000 --> 43:19.000]  We'll be right back. Infowars.com. Share that link.
[43:26.000 --> 43:32.000]  40% off what these products are found for under other names and not this other one name.
[43:32.000 --> 43:38.000]  They sell these under three or four other brands that other major distributors and suppliers have put out.
[43:38.000 --> 43:42.000]  The difference is we have it for 40% off what it is in stores.
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.000]  We're talking about Payne MD. We're talking about HGH max boost.
[43:47.000 --> 43:51.000]  We're talking about 1776 testosterone boost. These things are incredible.
[43:51.000 --> 43:56.000]  I would suggest you take half a dose or less when you first do and consult your healthcare provider.
[43:56.000 --> 44:00.000]  Those are so powerful. Get them at infowarsstore.com.
[44:00.000 --> 44:05.000]  I have been in a 28 year marathon battle with the globalist.
[44:05.000 --> 44:12.000]  I have come from nowhere to the very heights of politics, not just in America, but in the world.
[44:12.000 --> 44:17.000]  We are engaging the globalist at point-blank range in the information war.
[44:17.000 --> 44:23.000]  But I don't deserve the credit. Yes, I've persevered. But the listeners and viewers who've supported Infowars
[44:23.000 --> 44:26.000]  are the real reason you've had this success.
[44:26.000 --> 44:31.000]  We're having now the greatest victories in the fight against the new order you've ever had.
[44:31.000 --> 44:36.000]  We are now entering the final mile of the marathon.
[44:36.000 --> 44:41.000]  And that's why today it's more important than ever to realize how important you've been in this fight
[44:41.000 --> 44:45.000]  and to continue in the efforts you've been carrying out and to intensify them.
[44:45.000 --> 44:51.000]  God bless you all. I salute you. I thank you. And I beg you to intensify what you're doing now
[44:51.000 --> 44:54.000]  because we are over the target and this streak is happening.
[44:54.000 --> 45:17.000]  The fight is my fight. It's your fight. It's our fight. God bless you all.
[45:25.000 --> 45:32.000]  Natural chemicals found in the hips may even be helpful for a variety of health conditions,
[45:32.000 --> 45:37.000]  including those with osteoarthritis and for those with pain after surgery studies have shown.
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.000]  As for vitamin C and zinc themselves, you probably already know that they play an important role
[45:42.000 --> 45:46.000]  in nutrition, immune defense and the maintenance of your everyday health.
[45:46.000 --> 45:53.000]  It has been reported that intake of both is often inadequate, even in affluent populations like here in America.
[45:53.000 --> 46:00.000]  So next time you visit, be sure to check it out at InfowarsStore.com where we promise our rose hips don't lie.

[47:25.000 --> 47:33.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[47:33.000 --> 47:39.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[47:39.000 --> 47:46.000]  I want to wish you all a blessed and safe and alive Christmas.
[47:46.000 --> 47:50.000]  I do not wish you a woke mind controlled Christmas.
[47:50.000 --> 48:01.000]  A friend of mine this morning, I woke up and a well-known podcaster friend of mine sent me this link and said,
[48:01.000 --> 48:09.000]  oh, I'd forgotten about this. I'd forgotten that when they were on Joe Rogan's show, the head lawyer and Jack Dorsey,
[48:09.000 --> 48:14.000]  that they said in their own file the lawyer brought it while I was banned from Twitter.
[48:14.000 --> 48:19.000]  Now think about Sandy Hook, that wasn't the radar, hadn't talked about it in years, they made that a big issue to sue me later.
[48:19.000 --> 48:25.000]  It was because I confronted Oliver Darcy, lined up to go in a committee room about Internet censorship,
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  where they went and denied it was going on.
[48:27.000 --> 48:33.000]  If you remember, four and a half years ago when this happened, they were still denying that censorship was even happening,
[48:33.000 --> 48:39.000]  but we had the Defense Authorization Act and the Countering Foreign Propaganda Disinformation Act that said
[48:39.000 --> 48:49.000]  the FBI and CIA would work with legacy media to create these secret boards that would then watch and advise and order Big Tech on who to censor.
[48:49.000 --> 48:57.000]  Now the sixth Twitter drop came out on Friday and has the FBI commanding Twitter.
[48:57.000 --> 49:00.000]  Now again, it's not just Twitter as Congress is now reporting.
[49:00.000 --> 49:03.000]  So that's why they got so upset.
[49:03.000 --> 49:07.000]  So I haven't had time to go find the full confrontation. It was like five minutes long, but I remember,
[49:07.000 --> 49:11.000]  I said, you're involved in racketeering. I know you're getting government orders.
[49:11.000 --> 49:15.000]  I know it's part of this. I know it's the Defense Authorization Act.
[49:15.000 --> 49:20.000]  And that's when they got really freaked out and really scared because nobody else had put that together.
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  And it's not about credit, folks. It's about understanding. I don't make this stuff up.
[49:24.000 --> 49:28.000]  And if Trump would have listened back then, we could have done something.
[49:28.000 --> 49:34.000]  I even told Trump about this personally. I said, sir, it's $3 billion in funding, $2 billion, another billion.
[49:34.000 --> 49:39.000]  They're stay-behind networks, moles inside your administration. Here's some of their names.
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  And that's why they went completely ape and had headlines.
[49:41.000 --> 49:45.000]  Our main job at the White House is keeping Trump away from Alex Jones' info wars.
[49:45.000 --> 49:48.000]  Remember, I said he was being spied on. I said they were censoring people.
[49:48.000 --> 49:52.000]  I said the government was involved. And if he had got control, it would have been game over.
[49:52.000 --> 49:55.000]  But instead, they kept control. And now here we are.
[49:55.000 --> 50:00.000]  I'm going to tell you the rest of the story coming up in the next segment of what they're doing now and what's coming next.
[50:00.000 --> 50:10.000]  I first wanted to play, this is a funny compilation. I'm going to have the crew find the full confrontation that will air later in the next hour.
[50:10.000 --> 50:14.000]  But right now, let's go ahead and go to a little short clip where I confront him.
[50:14.000 --> 50:24.000]  And then it cuts back and forth to the Joe Rogan show with the head lawyer and the CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey at the time on the show. Here it is.
[50:24.000 --> 50:31.000]  Look at this right here. The guy that goes around policing and calling for censorship and then claims that Trump's wrong.
[50:31.000 --> 50:35.000]  There's no censorship of conservatives or patriots. You are incredible.
[50:35.000 --> 50:36.000]  How are you doing, Alex?
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  Eyes of the rat.
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  Eyes of the rat.
[50:44.000 --> 50:46.000]  Eyes of the rat.
[50:48.000 --> 50:49.000]  Eyes of the rat.
[50:49.000 --> 50:57.000]  Even more evil-looking person. He's just scammed, you're a virus to America and freedoms. Smelling like a possum that climbed out of the rear end of a dead cow.
[50:57.000 --> 51:01.000]  You look like a possum that got caught doing some really, really nasty stuff.
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  Eyes of the rat.
[51:03.000 --> 51:11.000]  Even more evil-looking person. He's just scammed, you're a virus to America and freedoms. Smelling like a possum that climbed out of the rear end of a dead cow.
[51:11.000 --> 51:15.000]  You look like a possum that got caught doing some really, really nasty stuff.
[51:15.000 --> 51:25.000]  Caught doing some really really nasty stuff Caught doing some really really nasty stuff
[51:25.000 --> 51:29.160]  Caught doing some really really nasty stuff
[51:29.160 --> 51:30.160]  That's enough?
[51:30.160 --> 51:31.160]  Really?
[51:31.160 --> 51:32.160]  That's hilarious
[51:32.160 --> 51:39.000]  Now all you people that have an inferiority complex and think that you can take the greatness
[51:39.000 --> 51:42.640]  of America and dominate it, that you might actually be somebody, you project your own
[51:42.640 --> 51:47.240]  loathing for yourself on everybody else, I'm a winner, I love myself, I love who I come
[51:47.240 --> 51:52.640]  from, victory and strength and honor, you are the definition of dishonor and one day
[51:52.640 --> 51:57.200]  in the encyclopedia Britannica, encyclopedia Galactica, it will have your face next to
[51:57.200 --> 51:58.200]  dishonor and the word rat.
[51:58.200 --> 52:00.200]  What do you hope to accomplish here?
[52:00.200 --> 52:04.640]  I'm just showing people just the certain vital nature of the bottom of the barrel, those
[52:04.640 --> 52:09.640]  dying news corporations have to dredge up from the front lines to attack the First Amendment.
[52:09.640 --> 52:13.800]  You're the equivalent of one thing, in my view, you're equivalent of the Hitler youth
[52:13.800 --> 52:17.240]  being put on the front line to stop the advance of the allies, so you came here to attack
[52:17.240 --> 52:18.240]  the media?
[52:18.240 --> 52:22.640]  You're not the media, you are fake news, you are the criminal news networks, you engage
[52:22.640 --> 52:26.840]  in a rapid tearing trying to shut down real news for information, you engage in lying and
[52:26.840 --> 52:29.640]  fraud in your audience on a premeditated continual basis.
[52:29.640 --> 52:37.640]  You got some damn evil eyes son.
[52:37.640 --> 52:41.520]  So they have found like a 12 minute club, I thought it was like a five minute confrontation
[52:41.520 --> 52:45.480]  and so we'll have that next hour, but it's really important because I remember I specifically
[52:45.480 --> 52:50.880]  went in to the stay behind networks and the government running it and the Obama funding
[52:50.880 --> 52:54.040]  and of course it's all true, of course it was all true because it's in the damn bill.
[52:54.040 --> 52:59.080]  That's what's so frustrating is I talked to the president so many times, you go, you're
[52:59.080 --> 53:03.160]  a great man, Alex, appreciate you, keep to work up, just wanted to check in, see how
[53:03.160 --> 53:07.240]  you're doing, pat me on the head and be like, listen, Fiona Hill's a mole, this guy's a
[53:07.240 --> 53:11.280]  mole, you got to stop him, there's a stay behind network, $3 million in funding, here's
[53:11.280 --> 53:15.200]  the name of it, please write it down, okay, okay, and then just a moment, you come back,
[53:15.200 --> 53:20.480]  oh, this is important, isn't it, yes, it's important, it's called the countering far
[53:20.480 --> 53:25.360]  disinformation and propaganda act and it's what they're doing against you, sir, and
[53:25.360 --> 53:31.280]  of course he started to figure it out by the end, but we have the intel, we know how to
[53:31.280 --> 53:36.440]  stop it, it's totally illegal what they did, it wasn't Russian election meddling, it was
[53:36.440 --> 53:42.200]  the deep state democratic party with the neocons and they totally stole the last two elections
[53:42.200 --> 53:47.320]  in front of us, with just the meddling alone, blocking information is election meddling,
[53:47.320 --> 53:51.560]  not to mention the machines and the mail-in balance, so here's the headlines, Elon Musk's
[53:51.560 --> 53:57.560]  Twitter poll ends with users seeking his departure, of course that was his master troll, now he
[53:57.560 --> 54:03.000]  says, oh, he already had his new CEO ready, he'll still be in charge of it, so he knew
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.780]  they'd vote against him, he goes, okay, I'll give you what you want, but he said, careful
[54:05.780 --> 54:11.920]  what you asked for, Elon Musk makes poll asking if he should step down as head of Twitter,
[54:11.920 --> 54:20.240]  57% say yes, Elon floats plan to step back from Twitter after meeting with Jared Kushner,
[54:20.240 --> 54:25.520]  Twitter files, even chief censor feared FBI was breaking the law helping US intelligence
[54:25.520 --> 54:29.880]  engage in domestic operations and that's all come out in the documents and of course even
[54:29.880 --> 54:37.000]  the head of their censorship thought it was okay to put nine-year-olds on grinder that
[54:37.000 --> 54:44.640]  is a gay hookup site, but that was okay with him, but, well, I can't get direct orders
[54:44.640 --> 54:48.400]  from the FBI to surveillance censor and shut people down, I thought you just tell us what
[54:48.400 --> 54:56.080]  you want, that's a big article up on infowars.com, it's a link to the Daily Mail, so Elon Musk
[54:56.080 --> 55:01.240]  set the step down as Twitter CEO, but not leave Twitter, here's the Twitter files part
[55:01.240 --> 55:09.040]  six, Twitter is an FBI subsidiary, big, giant, thick article breaking it all down with Matt
[55:09.040 --> 55:16.680]  Tabe's information, it's 28 pages long, I suggest you go read it for yourself, social
[55:16.680 --> 55:21.960]  media coordinated with DOJ and FBI is not limited to Twitter, Devin Nunes, yeah, no
[55:21.960 --> 55:27.320]  kidding, if you catch one fish out of a lake you go, that was the only fish because I pulled
[55:27.320 --> 55:33.920]  it out and I know it's the only one because I can't see the other ones, Elon lifts Twitter
[55:33.920 --> 55:38.160]  suspension of lepti journalists that people have spoken, oh, but when they had polls for
[55:38.160 --> 55:43.120]  me the vast majority wanted me to say that he didn't do it, but it's kind of uncool to
[55:43.120 --> 55:50.720]  even be on there and again Trump's a day late, a dollar short, Trump vows to ban the feds
[55:50.720 --> 55:56.760]  from targeting misinformation and elected, think about how preposterous that is, all
[55:56.760 --> 56:02.360]  news has a bias, all news isn't 100% right because none of us are omnipresent, none
[56:02.360 --> 56:08.240]  of us have all the answers, but the idea that they tell you what's true, the big corporations,
[56:08.240 --> 56:14.760]  the government, with the worst track record of lying by design and putting out official
[56:14.760 --> 56:23.440]  talking points, it is beyond disdusting and of course Musk has angered the system, exclusive
[56:23.440 --> 56:31.360]  probe of Musk's neuro link to scrutinize long criticized US animal welfare regulator, that's
[56:31.360 --> 56:36.080]  Reuters hooking all these microchips and wires up into monkey's brains and I'm not
[56:36.080 --> 56:43.280]  defending what he did, but he's not the only one and it is really expanding and accelerating
[56:43.280 --> 56:49.440]  right now, okay, we're going to start the second hour here in a little while and I am
[56:49.440 --> 56:59.480]  going to get into a big article by Brandon Smith at alt-market that's posted on infowars.com,
[56:59.480 --> 57:03.840]  leftist aren't capable of surviving economic collapse, here's why and then why are they
[57:03.840 --> 57:09.680]  supporting then the great reset and their own destruction, meanwhile the New York Times
[57:09.680 --> 57:16.560]  put out a Hanukkah crossword puzzle that's a swastika, why did they do stuff like that,
[57:16.560 --> 57:20.280]  imagine if you were I did that, well it's about we can do it but you can't, well don't
[57:20.280 --> 57:27.920]  worry I don't want to put out a swastika on Hanukkah but it's all they fetishize doing
[57:27.920 --> 57:31.320]  evil things, doing weird things, doing bad things and that they're the ones that are
[57:31.320 --> 57:38.240]  allowed to do it but nobody else can, we've also got news on the economy and on the Fed
[57:38.240 --> 57:42.840]  raising rates admitting they don't know what they're doing and so much more, hour number
[57:42.840 --> 57:50.080]  two straight ahead it's going to be jam-packed today, infowars.com, tomorrow's news.
[57:50.080 --> 57:54.600]  I've taken a lot of supplements over the years since high school and they had great effects
[57:54.600 --> 57:59.200]  and the science has gotten better and better and better over the years and now with all
[57:59.200 --> 58:04.160]  the things we're bombarded with and the water and the food and the feminizing factors it
[58:04.160 --> 58:09.040]  is more important than ever to use the compounds God gave us to boost our natural male potential
[58:09.040 --> 58:11.320]  but these products work great for women as well.
[58:11.320 --> 58:15.160]  Ladies and gentlemen we have Payne MD, it's the number one natural best seller under

[58:49.960 --> 58:56.680]  Until about 150 years ago cultures all over the world believe that people got sick and
[58:56.680 --> 59:02.080]  died in many cases in the winter because of something called vapors, they associated
[59:02.080 --> 59:05.720]  these poisonous vapors with cold weather.
[59:05.720 --> 59:10.560]  Of course it wasn't the cold weather or catching a chill that killed people, what was killing
[59:10.560 --> 59:14.160]  people was a lack of vitamin D3.
[59:14.160 --> 59:20.960]  You see the sun via your skin helps your body produce vitamin D3 but if you're not getting
[59:20.960 --> 59:26.040]  enough sun you will not produce vitamin D3 and then it's very easy for viruses and other
[59:26.040 --> 59:28.880]  things to start replicating and taking your body over.
[59:28.880 --> 59:32.800]  So now it's more important than ever because the winter is here to take high quality vitamin
[59:32.800 --> 59:37.520]  D3 and we have the best with our vitamin D3 gummies with calcium for better upload

[59:51.480 --> 59:57.480]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:46.960]  I will not let you down, you will be very very impressed I hope.
[01:00:51.480 --> 01:01:14.160]  But now children are literally being passed through the furnace in order to fuel hospitals
[01:01:14.160 --> 01:01:15.160]  in the UK.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:24.600]  It's been sacrificed on the altar of efficiency and prosperity.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.200]  The powdered flesh from dead babies.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.000]  Some people believe they can cure disease.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.640]  Because of its enormous popularity, Soil and Green is in short supply.
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:37.640]  Remember, Tuesday is Soil and Green Day.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.640]  The supply of Soil and Green has been exhausted.
[01:01:40.640 --> 01:01:45.640]  You must evacuate the area.
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:51.280]  The 7th Court ruled that the shareholders of PepsiCo, Big Builder Bird Group company,
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:56.560]  are not allowed to know what they're using the baby parts for and the flavoring but
[01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:58.000]  we already know.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.960]  So enjoy the flavor.
[01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:03.160]  We're going to get the real solution which is going to be a combination of death panels
[01:02:03.160 --> 01:02:04.440]  and sales taxes.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.360]  I'm consistently pro-death.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:08.320]  I'm for assisted suicide.
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:09.600]  I'm for regular suicide.
[01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.640]  And I'm for whatever gets the freeway moving.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:16.000]  Is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that patient, would
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:23.040]  it be better not to lay off those 10 teachers and to make that trade up in medical costs?
[01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:27.360]  But that's called the death panel and you're not supposed to have that discussion.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:41.880]  They told me to say that they were sorry but that you had become unreliable.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:44.520]  Is this the kind of society that you want to live in?
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:49.360]  Any kind of society that would do this to its children will do it to its senior citizens.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:51.960]  It will do it to its dissidents.
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:56.920]  That kind of society will also eventually turn on its police, on its army, on its prison
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:03:01.320]  guards, on the quizzlings and the collaborators who make that possible.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.480]  This is nothing but a suicide cult.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:11.280]  The scoops are on their way, the scoops are on their way, I repeat the scoops are on their
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.280]  way.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:17.920]  You will find out why Soylent Green means life, you will find out why Soylent Green
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:18.920]  means death.
[01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.920]  We've got to stop them.
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:21.920]  Come on.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:28.920]  Soylent Green is people.
[01:03:28.920 --> 01:03:48.000]  Next thing they'll be breeding is like cattle for food, you've got to tell them.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:55.880]  I want you to remember two words, infowars platinum in the history of infowars supplements

[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:03.680]  There's a war against our masculinity.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:08.280]  There's a war in the environment, the food, the water, the air, the electromagnetics,
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:14.680]  the injections to really cut us off from what God designed us to be but through mother
[01:05:14.680 --> 01:05:21.240]  nature the creator gave us compounds that can counteract what the globalists have done
[01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:25.600]  and I got to tell you all our supplements are great but we've got a real game changer
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:26.600]  now.

[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:22.600]  All right I want to as we start this hour dive into what the collapse is going to look
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:26.840]  like we're already about 10% into it but now it's going to accelerate.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:32.640]  There are ways to mitigate it and deal with it and then they have found the full 12 minute
[01:06:32.640 --> 01:06:36.520]  clips will air about 10 minutes of the next segment of me confronting Oliver Darcy about
[01:06:36.520 --> 01:06:42.160]  how specifically Obama was running secret disinformation boards with the just department
[01:06:42.160 --> 01:06:47.760]  the Pentagon liaisoning with dinosaur media to censor the American people criminally and
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:51.480]  illegally so we're going to play that clip here in just a moment guys so cue that up
[01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:57.360]  but then the full clip will be next segment again nobody else was saying this I was telling
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:01.160]  Tucker Carlson others at the time was going on that's what Tucker two weeks ago said
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.880]  Alex Jones broke this and it's not about oh I broke it I'm great you know give me a
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:10.200]  gold medal I need to be kept in the fight the screw needs to be kept in the fight we
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:13.080]  make it really easy for you to keep us in the fight let me get a little bit of inside
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:17.880]  baseball and background I knew 20 years ago that CBD oil that has all the THC taken out
[01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:22.600]  of it in major medical studies and all over the news now is great for inflammation great
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:27.480]  for pain and good for your brain and good for your heart and good for not you know stopping
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:35.280]  strokes you name it I've been taking CBD for Achilles pain now that was prescribed to me
[01:07:35.280 --> 01:07:38.600]  it wasn't prescription but my doctor said you know here's a prescription go get this
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:43.680]  brand of CBD oil full spectrum CBD oil and it's it's it's done wonders because I haven't
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:50.200]  wanted to be seven weeks off my leg my Achilles is gone I use it as a cane my leg and it's
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:57.360]  very painful I take CBD oil well we never sold CBD oil because still some jurisdictions
[01:07:57.360 --> 01:08:01.040]  would prosecute people for it even though there was no CBD in it you know now George
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:05.440]  straight sells it promotes it now it's in Walmart now it's everywhere but I still held
[01:08:05.440 --> 01:08:09.880]  back because they still can do that well I did it with a big top firm it shipped out
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:14.800]  of Denver Colorado by another company show they can't set me up and say I'm you know
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:19.120]  selling something illegal it's not they don't want you to have it because it's so good it
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:24.160]  doesn't do anything to your brain it doesn't get you high there's no THC in it it is simply
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:28.520]  amazing and I've been on it for I don't know three four years and I forgot to take it this
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:31.560]  morning and I'm literally feeling my Achilles right now I'm getting close to having the
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:35.120]  surgery soon folks but it's just it's out of control I've just ignored this for eight
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:41.720]  years so I was hiking in Big Ben at night like an idiot stepped in a damn hole but let me
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.800]  just get back to what I was saying I didn't want to be off my feet so I should have done
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:49.000]  it then I've been off my feet for two weeks now it's all gone it's all rotted away in
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:55.320]  the crows so I have to have a full reconstruction it's gonna be hellish but that's a side issue

[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:33.440]  it was five in my memory it's 12 minutes but but here's a short clip where I nail it four
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:39.080]  and a half years ago in the halls of Congress to the CNN deputy censor in chief under Brian
[01:10:39.080 --> 01:10:40.080]  Stelter.
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:45.400]  That's what wants to run your life folks if you don't start running your life he's going
[01:10:45.400 --> 01:10:51.960]  to run it he's already thinks he's got scouts one of the main presenters in this whole operation
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:56.680]  you don't think we don't know about obama's countering disinformation from an end act
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:01.360]  you don't think all that's going to come out who's funding this and your little ID card
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:06.600]  and all the rest of it you think we're stupid you think we're playing games huh you think
[01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:14.480]  we don't know a thing or two son yeah that's illegal what obama set up it's all going to
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:18.640]  come down you think you've got some democrats and some committees and some stay behind networks
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.280]  like the 37 angry democrats for the just department time to shut down Trump you think you've got
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:25.840]  a rogue group operating inside those agencies that you're going to be able to shut down
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:30.000]  the free press of America we are here all the beer is here the American people are watching
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:34.640]  and they're not going to let you win you called for us to be the platform you pushed it now
[01:11:34.640 --> 01:11:38.720]  you say it's not even having it is true see I'm wobbly for it that's not all seen and
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:42.480]  it was called to me to be taken off here that's all you've done that's why you said you need
[01:11:42.480 --> 01:11:46.480]  to be taken down why aren't you taking it down you said don't that's that's okay that's
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:51.600]  enough you're going to see the raw footage that hasn't been out in years they took off
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:55.920]  YouTube and everywhere else in a few minutes this is why they're so scared I was advising
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:02.640]  the president he fired some of the moles because of us they literally put the CIA on our ass
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:07.120]  after that that's why they follow the Sandy Hook garbage ran the whole defaults now they
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:14.200]  want to shut us down don't let them so you get what's coming next let's get left to start
[01:12:14.200 --> 01:12:20.040]  capable of surviving economic collapse here's why there is one factor that constantly stands
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:24.760]  out of the absolutely essential to a person's chances of surviving crisis event that factor
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:28.680]  is mindset but they're trained to be victims they're trained to not be self-sufficient
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:35.560]  they're trained to let the predators tell them what to do in every actuary experience and
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:39.320]  training are highly valuable having proper tools and preparation on hand is a huge advantage
[01:12:39.320 --> 01:12:43.880]  but at the end without mental toughness the ability to adapt the most prepared person in the world
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:49.720]  will still likely bite the dust and it's such an important article getting into the left
[01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:55.000]  and all the numbers and how they are undermining our entire society including our military
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:03.800]  to bring us down and collapse us from within in 1980 you might be able to find a large number of
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:09.160]  mentally tough people that considered themselves democrats today you will not find anyone
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:15.880]  when they give a bunch of great examples leftists thrive on crisis but die out during collapse
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:23.400]  leftists are anti preparedness leftists have an aversion to hardship leftists have no practical
[01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:33.240]  skill sets leftists rely on government to fix their problems man this article is so key and it's
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:41.480]  absolutely on target and statistically the left are more apt to steal more or less to lie seven to
[01:13:41.480 --> 01:13:47.960]  ten times depending on the study seven to nine times and but then they're cheerleading the collapse
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:53.320]  of society they're cheerleading poison shots because they're the captured minds that think just
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:58.360]  complying gets them ahead yeah it gets a pat on the head from corporate media and the left
[01:13:58.360 --> 01:14:03.720]  they may even give you some functionary job while you are destroying your own future

[01:33:38.040 --> 01:33:47.720]  with a ton of news to cover but i wasn't really planning on covering the january sixth
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:52.600]  stuff today in fact i didn't even know they were having this hearing i had some january six news
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:34:01.080]  in my stack because republicans some republicans are saying they're going to investigate the
[01:34:01.080 --> 01:34:07.080]  investigators they're going to try to get down to the actual truth about january sixth federal
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:18.600]  agent involvement prior knowledge of that day's potential events that nancy polosi and miriel
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:29.320]  bowser and others had but i'm watching liz cheney open the january sixth hearing today
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:34.120]  where they're they're they're expecting some big announcement the democrats have been building
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:37.880]  this up like they're gonna have big a big announcement today or maybe even criminally
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:43.800]  referred donald trump we'll see if that happens or if that's just hype because quite frankly there's
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:50.120]  no interest in the january sixth hearings none people aren't interested anymore they know it's
[01:34:50.120 --> 01:34:59.240]  all politics they know january sixth was if anything a little out of hand at worst and it was trump
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:03.400]  supporters that died that day not the police officers like you've been lied to about but
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:09.640]  i'm watching liz cheney open the hearing and i'm just sitting there and i'm like man
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:15.800]  again if you are an uninformed american and you're watching this and you're taking it at
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:20.760]  face value you're just sitting there getting raped by propaganda i mean you are just sitting
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:29.080]  there getting your mind raped by disinformation and it's you know it's a gut blow because i know
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:35.640]  she's lying liz cheney that is i know she's lying about everything that she says but it's not just
[01:35:35.640 --> 01:35:42.280]  the lies that she tells in her little presentation it's it's in the presentation itself it's in
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:48.040]  these assumptions that you're supposed to make based off of what she's saying you're supposed to
[01:35:48.040 --> 01:35:54.920]  for example it says liz cheney the republican liz cheney's not a republican what about liz
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:36:01.000]  cheney makes her a republican because her dad was dick cheney because she puts an r conveniently
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:06.920]  next to her name she doesn't vote republican she doesn't vote republican values she doesn't represent
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:15.880]  the constituents in wyoming nothing about liz cheney is a republican except oh they say
[01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:20.440]  republican liz cheney and then they put the r behind her name and so if you're watching this
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:24.920]  and you're ignorant you're thinking oh wow well just must be an honorable republican to look into
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:30.520]  her own party and look into her own voters she must be a good person to do that wow glad she's
[01:36:30.520 --> 01:36:36.760]  ahead of this committee just right there with the presentation with the assumption you've
[01:36:36.760 --> 01:36:43.560]  already been propagandized you've already been misinformed then she goes on to say so it's
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:51.080]  already it's it's it's lies layered on top of lies framed in a frame of lies just just everything
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:56.120]  about it is totally fake you know that you can sit there and watch it most of america probably knows
[01:36:56.120 --> 01:37:01.560]  that sitting there and watching it that's why they don't watch it anymore because they know it's bs then
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:07.800]  she goes on to say something like this has never been done before we've never had an election
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:12.280]  denier before we've never had a president deny the election results we've never had a group of people
[01:37:12.920 --> 01:37:20.360]  and it's just like again that is just an outright lie she knows she's lying she knows that democrats
[01:37:20.360 --> 01:37:25.080]  have a long history of contesting elections but why doesn't she bring that up because she's not a
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:31.800]  republican in this case she's a democrat now when she's running for election in wyoming she wants to
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:36.280]  be known as a republican because that's how she gets in but she's not a republican now that she's
[01:37:36.280 --> 01:37:40.120]  already in and she's got to do the political bidding of the deep state who does she really
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:50.440]  represent the democrat party so she says nobody ever did what donald trump did causing an insurrection
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:55.320]  remember donald trump's tweets from that day you can actually go find him now he called for peace
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:06.120]  he said go home um oh what an insurrection the dc i don't know if it was the mayor or the police
[01:38:06.120 --> 01:38:10.680]  decide they're gonna send out an emergency notification to everybody within five miles of
[01:38:10.680 --> 01:38:17.000]  the capital and then as soon as everybody's phone goes off everybody leaves by the way it's funny
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:21.400]  a little bit of a side note to just show you the power that the government has
[01:38:22.360 --> 01:38:26.680]  you couldn't even get service that day anywhere you could not get service you couldn't make a
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:32.280]  call you couldn't get a text out but man they got that emergency alert on everybody's phone
[01:38:32.280 --> 01:38:37.160]  like they just overwhelm the whole network that's amazing but that's just a side note
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:43.640]  no the democrats have contested elections multiple times in fact the democrats have
[01:38:43.640 --> 01:38:52.360]  contested every presidential election that they've lost this millennium whether it was al gore or
[01:38:52.360 --> 01:38:59.320]  hillary clinton the democrats contested it the democrats denied it the democrats pled to congress
[01:38:59.320 --> 01:39:03.080]  saying we can't count these electoral votes i mean i'm not going to sit here and play the
[01:39:03.080 --> 01:39:08.440]  footage over and over again of maxine waters and chuck schumer and all the other democrats saying
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:14.360]  this election was stolen from al gore we all remember it if you were there we all remember
[01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:18.760]  the the election if you were alive for it you can even go back deeper in history in fact
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:25.960]  there was one time the democrats actually pulled off or tried to pull off what the
[01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:33.000]  trump supporters wanted to happen on january 6 and that was a congressional review of the electoral
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:40.040]  votes to say they can't be certified they're illegitimate for reasons x y and z and so the
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:46.520]  case that trump was trying to make was all of these illegal votes the mail-in votes the early
[01:39:46.520 --> 01:39:51.720]  votes that were all placed in under color of law in the name of covet no actual law they were
[01:39:51.720 --> 01:39:57.080]  illegal votes that's why donald trump said hey you got 200 000 illegal votes right here that that
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:40:01.720]  aren't constitutionally legal they shouldn't be counted that's bigger than the margin of victory
[01:40:01.720 --> 01:40:08.040]  this should be an issue no the democrats actually did do that i forget when it was
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:11.400]  because i wasn't planning on covering this day i would have tried to look it up but no i
[01:40:12.520 --> 01:40:16.440]  was at the 1940s i can't remember there was a there was a presidential election that the
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:21.480]  democrats lost where they did the exact same thing they presented their arguments to congress
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:26.840]  they said we cannot certify this election we cannot certify these electoral votes and here's why so
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:34.440]  no it has been done before liz cheney but see that's my point is that the whole thing is just a lie
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:40.680]  it's a lie on top of lies framed in a lie boxed in a lie with a bow on it that's a lie and if you
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:46.840]  don't know any better and you actually take it at face value or believe that liz cheney or the rest
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:50.840]  of the january 6 committee are trustworthy you're just getting raped you're being mentally raped
[01:40:50.840 --> 01:40:59.320]  psychologically raped smashed by political propaganda it is information warfare it is
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:05.000]  a propaganda campaign and it's stunning i'm just sitting there getting a cup of coffee watching this
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:12.840]  and it really does make you angry doesn't it that liz cheney is such a unmitigated liar
[01:41:12.840 --> 01:41:16.920]  and that she's not even going to be punished either she will face no punishment for what
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:21.800]  she's done to this country she will face no punishment for the lies she tells the american
[01:41:21.800 --> 01:41:30.040]  people and yet there are hundreds of january 6 defendants sitting and rotting away in jail cells
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:37.800]  so that corrupt bitches like liz cheney can sit up there on the moral high ground and tell you
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:45.160]  they're justified to propagandize you and they're justified to weaponize the government against
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:50.360]  the american people because they put innocent people in jail and they lied about innocent people
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:59.480]  and they called veterans and mothers and fathers and grandmothers and doctors terrorists because
[01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:06.360]  they dare stand up and speak their mind and they dare call out the obvious corruption
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:11.480]  that has been plaguing this nation for decades and i don't know where it goes because i just
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:19.800]  sit there looking at it and i know how the universe works and it's not going to end well for them
[01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:30.520]  the problem that i see here that's a little unsettling is whatever fate the liars in our
[01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:37.320]  government are going to face whatever fate the liars on the january 6 committee are going to face
[01:42:37.320 --> 01:42:42.680]  i'm just worried we're all going to end up facing it that's what i'm concerned about i mean justice
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:47.320]  is going to be done may the heavens fall i'm just worried it's going to fall on all of us at this
[01:42:47.320 --> 01:42:54.120]  point i mean there is no way people like liz cheney get away with their lies forever there's just no
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:43:01.640]  way but what what's going to come of it i have an extremely important message to all of my fellow

[01:46:45.000 --> 01:47:01.160]  support and we wish you a very peaceful happy and merry christmas leading a frontal assault
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:17.080]  on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:28.680]  so elon musk supposedly unofficially is going to be stepping down as the head of twitter there's
[01:47:28.680 --> 01:47:34.760]  all kinds of rumors abound obviously nothing official about a twitter poll some people thinking
[01:47:34.760 --> 01:47:39.960]  it was a bot fishing expedition i don't believe that's the case i think he's done plenty of those
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:46.200]  i don't think he needs to run a poll to do that anymore was it a troll was he serious was it something
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:55.800]  he already planned out nothing has been said since the poll concluded with 57 percent saying elon musk
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:48:01.560]  should step down as head of twitter now of course again the rumor mills churning everybody's got
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:05.400]  their opinion i haven't heard any official statements the only thing i would lead any
[01:48:05.400 --> 01:48:11.400]  credence to would be the fact he was with jared kushner at the world cup right before
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:19.880]  the announcement or the poll rather was made so perhaps maybe some influence there but again
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:30.120]  we don't know for sure and i was thinking more about it last night
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:39.320]  and it's it's it's a hard thing in the modern times that we live in to take anything at face value
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:49.000]  and you know i've got i'll use this as an example i've got a my barber is is more skeptical than i
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:54.440]  am if you can believe that he doesn't trust anybody and so we start talking about elon musk
[01:48:54.440 --> 01:48:59.880]  earlier this morning as he's cutting my hair and he doesn't trust him at all he's like you
[01:48:59.880 --> 01:49:04.760]  know if you know if they tell you who they are believe them you know look at him wearing the
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:12.200]  devil's advocate or the devil's surrogate costume he uses it as his pick profile picture
[01:49:13.320 --> 01:49:17.240]  and my rebuttal is like well i think he's trolling i think i get what he's doing and
[01:49:17.240 --> 01:49:21.960]  i'm not saying he's perfect with all things and who knows what the technology is working on that
[01:49:21.960 --> 01:49:28.760]  could that could eventually be used to oppress us but i mean part of me just kind of like it's
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:35.960]  kind of like if you're a gambler you have to reserve a certain percentage or a certain bet and
[01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:40.680]  just say hey look i know that this is going to happen i've got to remember like i know there's
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:45.160]  going to be an upset in an nc basketball ncaa double a basketball tournament like you just know
[01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:49.000]  that so you hold it out so you're not going to pick all the favorite seeds you got to pick
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:53.960]  at least one or two underdogs because you just know it's going to happen so it's like that's
[01:49:53.960 --> 01:50:00.840]  where i'm kind of at is am i just supposed to believe that we can't have any heroes we can't
[01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:06.600]  have any champions doesn't mean they're going to be perfect but am i just i can't believe that elon
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:13.080]  musk can't be doing anything good he is doing good things he is exposing the democrat party
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:19.000]  fbi censorship with big tech he is exposing anthony fouchy he has called for him to be
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:23.880]  prosecuted they're teasing another round of covet fouchy drops coming out on twitter we've
[01:50:23.880 --> 01:50:28.760]  already had seven twitter files released another one today number seven part eight apparently
[01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:39.160]  going to be about fouchy so i understand why people don't trust anybody especially people in
[01:50:39.160 --> 01:50:44.680]  positions of high power and influence like elon musk and so i'm trying to look at all the angles
[01:50:45.960 --> 01:50:53.160]  and i'm thinking okay if elon musk is not just organic meaning he's making up his own decisions
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:58.440]  whether they're preconceived or just on a whim he's he's doing what he wants he's deciding what he
[01:50:58.440 --> 01:51:03.800]  wants to do i trust that even if he does bad things more than somebody that's being controlled
[01:51:03.800 --> 01:51:13.240]  even if he makes mistakes but i'm thinking okay you've got all the twitter files coming out
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.480]  now i've got the fbi declassified documents showing how the government helped assassinate
[01:51:19.480 --> 01:51:26.680]  jfk and then cover it up i mean it's like whoa hello that's bombshell news like five alarm fire
[01:51:26.680 --> 01:51:34.920]  here and it just barely even gets announced and i'm thinking now if i'm the ultimate skeptic i'd
[01:51:34.920 --> 01:51:42.040]  say that elon musk is doing this to distract us from the jfk files but again it's like i don't
[01:51:42.040 --> 01:51:47.640]  even want to think that's the case i'd rather think elon musk is his own man doing his own thing
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:54.200]  whether it's good or bad he's not controlled opposition and he doesn't want to use technology
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:52:00.920]  to oppress humanity i do believe that but it is amazing how that litter little twitter poll
[01:52:01.880 --> 01:52:07.000]  and anything he does now he can pretty much just dominate the headlines and distract from
[01:52:07.000 --> 01:52:12.200]  anything else that's going on and certainly he knows that by the way i'm pretty sure that twitter's
[01:52:12.200 --> 01:52:20.920]  shares have jumped up since the poll was put out so i don't have all the answers i'm not sure anybody
[01:52:20.920 --> 01:52:24.920]  does right now except maybe elon musker some people he's talking to as far as what he was
[01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:30.120]  thinking when he put out the poll was he serious did he did he already decide he was going to do
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:43.480]  that some time ago was it influenced by jared kushner and of course maybe it's all just a
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:56.200]  distraction what's worse we have new fbi files showing how the fbi did the political operations
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:53:02.280]  of the democrat party ahead of the 2020 election to censor republicans to censor donald trump
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:07.000]  to censor any negative news about joe biden we now know that a total violation of the first
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:15.400]  amendment total collusion total fascism total corruption okay or is it the fbi and the cia
[01:53:15.400 --> 01:53:25.160]  working hand in glove to assassinate a us president and then working hand in glove with the media
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:33.480]  to make sure that that story never goes to air pretty serious stuff no matter how you look at it
[01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:44.280]  it and yet elon musk's poll should he leave twitter or not was the biggest news story despite all of
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:51.240]  that and it's not just a news story that people are following it's getting more attention from
[01:53:51.240 --> 01:53:55.640]  the federal government it's getting more attention from lawmakers and congress they're all following
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:54:00.680]  what elon musk is doing they're all ignoring the jfk files they're all ignoring the twitter files
[01:54:00.680 --> 01:54:10.120]  so will elon musk step down after the poll says so he said he would no announcements
[01:54:10.120 --> 01:54:18.120]  been made yet we'll be continuing to monitor this throughout the day but here's something
[01:54:18.120 --> 01:54:23.800]  that you'll never see go in the other way elon musk lifts twitter suspensions of lefty journalists
[01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:29.800]  the people have spoken so he put up a poll he likes to do these polls i don't mind it either i mean
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:34.040]  the one thing about elon musk i think it is fair to say is he's he's the most transparent
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:38.920]  as far as any of the big tech heads are concerned i don't even think it's close
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:47.000]  so he puts up a poll and says should these leftist journalists be put back on twitter
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:55.400]  and of course they got reinstated why because conservatives and republicans believe in free
[01:54:55.400 --> 01:55:02.920]  speech and while it's split as far as some people want them to kind of taste their own medicine
[01:55:02.920 --> 01:55:07.880]  and rub their nose in it and celebrate when they get censored just to say ha ha this is how it feels
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:12.920]  how do you like it that's just a 50-50 split i think when it comes to votes or opinion sharing
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:19.400]  but i think even those conservatives or republicans or patriots that would say no suspend the lefties
[01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:22.600]  even they would admit that they're free speech and they're probably just doing that
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:27.240]  that as giving them a taste of their own medicine so you'll never have an instant
[01:55:28.520 --> 01:55:33.240]  i mean you could use alex jones as the litmus test you'll never have an instant where elon musk says
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:41.080]  i guess it worked with donald trump but you won't have liberals voting to reinstate
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:45.880]  conservatives you won't have democrats voting to give republicans free speech back you will only
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:51.480]  have it the other way and that's what we saw with his recent poll and by the way i've got more on that
[01:55:51.480 --> 01:55:58.040]  one of the individuals taylor lorenz you know this is a really interesting case study of a
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:08.120]  female psychology taylor lorenz and if there's anything as a witch maybe that's your example
[01:56:08.120 --> 01:56:16.200]  i'll explain that later the twitter follows part six the fbi subsidiary and now we've got more they're
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:21.320]  on seven eight coming next is going to hit fouchy and the covet protocols again but it's just like
[01:56:22.040 --> 01:56:28.920]  total red-handed democrat party collusion with the federal government to use big tech big media to
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:32.600]  censor their political opposition and censor negative stories about biden ahead of the
[01:56:32.600 --> 01:56:38.520]  presidential election everything they accused russia of every all the rhetoric all the the the
[01:56:38.520 --> 01:56:43.960]  clap trapping all the shouting and screaming and wailing and whining and investigations all of it
[01:56:43.960 --> 01:56:50.120]  because of russia russia russia it was the democrats the entire time but we all knew that didn't we
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:57.080]  we all knew that didn't we the fbi kept busy censoring conservatives
[01:56:57.720 --> 01:57:05.080]  censoring conservatives instead of chasing crooks and chasing down pedophiles yeah well we know why
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:18.680]  that is we know why that is just like the democrat party they are one in the same
[01:57:20.840 --> 01:57:27.240]  more interested in taking out their political opposition then stopping actual criminals
[01:57:28.280 --> 01:57:32.120]  but deba nunez has come out and made a statement which we all know is true
[01:57:32.120 --> 01:57:36.360]  we're just waiting to get the evidence like we have with the twitter files social media
[01:57:36.360 --> 01:57:44.280]  media coordination between doj and fbi is not limited to twitter says deba nunez and we've
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:51.080]  got more on that coming up after this short break there's a war against our masculinity
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:57.800]  there's a war in the environment the food the water the air the electromagnetics the injections
[01:57:57.800 --> 01:58:05.720]  to really cut us off from what god designed us to be but through mother nature the creator gave

[02:00:17.960 --> 02:00:26.200]  two-thirds of voters believe social media engaged in politically motivated censorship
[02:00:26.200 --> 02:00:30.760]  and demand congressional action according to new poll so what's the other one-third of voters
[02:00:30.760 --> 02:00:42.600]  asleep lying liberals democrats deranged ignorant all the above it's not a belief it's like oh i
[02:00:42.600 --> 02:00:48.280]  believe it's raining in austin texas today i believe it was storming last night we've had like 10
[02:00:48.280 --> 02:00:54.680]  inches of rain it's crazy we've had a complete monsoon here roads flooding everything i believe
[02:00:54.680 --> 02:01:02.280]  it rained in austin texas today i believe that and so do two two-thirds of austin two-thirds of
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:08.600]  my austin colleagues believe it rained we mean believed i step outside it's freaking pouring
[02:01:08.600 --> 02:01:15.160]  i believe it rained i believe the democrats and the fbi engaged in politically motivated
[02:01:15.160 --> 02:01:18.600]  censorship on the internet i believe that i believe it
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:26.840]  i believe there's water in the ocean i believe that
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:35.640]  now everybody knows it except the most ignorant americans so here is the analogy
[02:01:35.640 --> 02:01:40.040]  this would be like and this is why it's so frustrating but it's not your neighbor's house
[02:01:40.040 --> 02:01:46.040]  it's it's your house but this is like if you come home or let's say you step outside to do some
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:52.680]  yard work at your house and you see your neighbor's house is on fire and there's flames shooting out
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:57.400]  the garage and then a window busted out flames shooting out the window starting to spread to the
[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:06.520]  to the main house and you see your neighbor standing in the street and you walk out and you say uh
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:16.360]  hey uh know your house is on fire and then the other neighbor comes out and he says yeah i i
[02:02:16.360 --> 02:02:25.880]  believe your house is on fire and he just sits there and watches it burn whether he denies it's on
[02:02:25.880 --> 02:02:31.560]  fire or accepts it's on fire it doesn't make a difference the house is on fire the house is
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:38.040]  going to burn down if nobody tries to put out the fire like let's call the fire department
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:47.720]  let's put out the fire that's america we're on fire except it's not just limited to the garage
[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:56.040]  we are on a five alarm fire right now oh hey the fbi cia kills us presidents and covers it up with
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:03:01.720]  the media oh hey the fbi worked with the democrat party to censor their political opposition and
[02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:06.360]  it's more important for them to censor donald trump supporters then remove child rape from the
[02:03:06.360 --> 02:03:14.920]  platform uh hi your house is on fire would you like to put it out the fbi has lost all forms of
[02:03:14.920 --> 02:03:20.840]  all forms of trust and credibility according to almost every new poll congressional approval
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:26.840]  rating 90 disapprove fbi approval rating like 80 disapprove that's a major downturn
[02:03:31.080 --> 02:03:34.920]  so yeah oh look the whole neighborhood's on fire now should we do something
[02:03:35.720 --> 02:03:42.920]  hey should we should we call the fire department well too late now or maybe that's where we're at
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:47.720]  maybe it's already too late now maybe we're all just sitting here watching it burn down and we know
[02:03:47.720 --> 02:03:53.880]  it's done maybe that's how our government feels they've they've felt this way for a long time so
[02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:58.760]  they just don't care that america's burning to the ground they figure let's throw some let's throw
[02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:04.120]  some gasoline on that fire let's just burn this sucker down even quicker so we can have our great
[02:04:04.120 --> 02:04:09.560]  reset build back better world economic forum corporate world government because we've already
[02:04:09.560 --> 02:04:20.840]  sold out to that anyway so that's what this is like complete unequivocal undeniable
[02:04:23.160 --> 02:04:33.480]  evidence no reasonable doubt cia fbi helped murder and cover up the killing of jfk fbi
[02:04:33.480 --> 02:04:41.080]  democrat party censored the truth violated the first amendment and censored stories about joe

[02:08:19.480 --> 02:08:23.640]  ground so whether it's the corruption at the fbi whether it's the corruption of the democrat party
[02:08:23.640 --> 02:08:28.440]  whether it's the censorship the violations of the first amendment or the southern border it's all
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:32.440]  the same the house is on fire does anybody want to put the fire out or are we gonna let the thing
[02:08:32.440 --> 02:08:39.960]  burn to the ground senior advisor can't say why biden hasn't visited the southern border
[02:08:40.840 --> 02:08:45.960]  well what do you mean we don't need a senior advisor he told us joe biden told us why he
[02:08:45.960 --> 02:08:51.240]  doesn't visit the border because it's not an issue is what he said it's not an important issue it was
[02:08:51.240 --> 02:08:57.800]  more important to have a hundred gay people and trans people at the white house to celebrate gay
[02:08:57.800 --> 02:09:01.640]  marriage it was more important for biden to have other celebrities at the white house to promote
[02:09:01.640 --> 02:09:08.600]  the vaccine and also we've got to get the hundreds of billions of dollars to ukraine we've got to
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:12.440]  get the new omnibus bill passed i mean there's so many things that are more important than stopping
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:20.520]  the invasion that is reaching levels i mean folks even even democrat leaders democrat party members
[02:09:20.520 --> 02:09:29.560]  on a local level are like okay uh this is unsustainable and it's you just extrapolate it out and you
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:35.080]  realize oh oh it's unsustainable for your cities now oh it's unsustainable for your areas now
[02:09:35.080 --> 02:09:41.000]  ah now you see how the conservative areas have felt that you've swarmed with these illegal immigrants
[02:09:41.000 --> 02:09:46.200]  now you know how the country is feeling and dealing with this invasion that you facilitated at the
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:51.080]  southern border i mean there should be hundreds of arrests if we had an actual justice department
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:56.120]  in this country there should be hundreds of arrests dealing with what's going on at the
[02:09:56.120 --> 02:10:02.600]  southern border hundreds of arrests for that that crime of illegal immigration and human trafficking
[02:10:02.600 --> 02:10:09.880]  there should be hundreds of arrests when it comes to the censorship at twitter and facebook and google
[02:10:09.880 --> 02:10:14.840]  and youtube and everywhere else with the government and the democrat party we should be seeing hundreds
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:24.840]  of arrests for these blatant my gigantic criminal activities and we get nothing and biden says there's
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:30.440]  no problem at the border really we are in urgent need for help new york city mayor starts freaking
[02:10:30.440 --> 02:10:38.360]  out over impeding impending wave of illegal immigrants oh you have too many oh you have
[02:10:38.360 --> 02:10:44.440]  too many illegal immigrants oh we've well we've only brought in five million this year i mean
[02:10:44.440 --> 02:10:50.840]  you're a sanctuary city where did you expect them to go where did you expect them to go
[02:10:50.840 --> 02:10:56.120]  you're not going to take them into your house the obamas with their multiple million dollar
[02:10:56.120 --> 02:11:00.440]  mansions they're not going to take them in the bitons with their multiple million dollar mansions
[02:11:00.440 --> 02:11:03.720]  they're not going to take them in so where are they supposed to go yeah look at this footage
[02:11:03.720 --> 02:11:09.960]  from these overcrowded facilities by the way where's aoc where's aoc with the stop story
[02:11:09.960 --> 02:11:16.920]  crocodile tears you know the actress where's she at oh it's a democrat in the white house now so
[02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:24.360]  those publicity stunts don't work i see yes even new york city democrat mayor saying this is unbelievable
[02:11:24.360 --> 02:11:28.600]  we can't handle this well you might want to tell the president that but you're not allowed to do that
[02:11:28.600 --> 02:11:35.640]  are you uh biden has cucked the entire democrat party or is it china el paso mayor declares state of
[02:11:35.640 --> 02:11:41.640]  emergency over border crisis new footage shows extreme overcrowding at the border patrol center
[02:11:41.640 --> 02:11:49.160]  processing in el paso new york city declares emergency over migrant crisis biden says there's no
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:55.960]  issue denver mayor declares emergency says city on the verge of reaching a breaking point amid
[02:11:55.960 --> 02:12:00.920]  influx of illegal immigrants yes the whole country the whole country's at a breaking point but see
[02:12:00.920 --> 02:12:06.120]  they just say this stuff to the media and they just put it out there like oh you're just feeding the
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:12.280]  geese or something oh i'm just gonna throw you some breadcrumbs uh no somebody running this
[02:12:13.240 --> 02:12:19.320]  why don't you direct your commentary at mayorkas why don't you direct your commentary at biden
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:24.120]  the media already knows this the american people already know this we already know we've been invaded
[02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:31.880]  we already know it's a crisis you have now joined us quit telling us what we know is going on
[02:12:31.880 --> 02:12:38.600]  quit telling us what we've been trying to tell you all these democrat mayors from new york and
[02:12:38.600 --> 02:12:44.920]  denver and everywhere else they should be directing their commentary directly at mayorkas and directly
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:53.320]  at biden but you don't ever bark up the democrat tree because they're all in the cult and that's
[02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:58.600]  never allowed no negativity about the party is ever allowed so they just put out these statements
[02:12:58.600 --> 02:13:04.040]  the border is a crisis the border is a massive issue we're on a breaking point okay who's to
[02:13:04.040 --> 02:13:10.760]  blame why don't we do something about it texas governor abbott seeks state probe of ngo's aiding
[02:13:10.760 --> 02:13:16.840]  illegal immigrants crossing border you know i'm getting a lot of good rhetoric from governor abbott
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:22.840]  i'm getting some good ideas maybe even a little execution nowhere near enough abbot should be
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:28.200]  leading the way like ronda santis has led the way on so many different issues this is abbots
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:34.680]  chance to lead the way shut the border down greg make the biden administration intervene
[02:13:35.400 --> 02:13:44.200]  send the texas guard and say nobody's crossing our border take over the texas border yeah step over
[02:13:44.200 --> 02:13:50.840]  the federal government yeah take over and say no we're not letting anybody in anymore we're
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:55.240]  arresting people we're not bringing them in we're not giving them court dates
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:01.480]  i mean if you wanted to give a little bit of an out you could say we'll take them to a different
[02:14:01.480 --> 02:14:07.560]  state i'd be okay with that just to have a little bit of an out play a little bit of politics a
[02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.560]  little bit of give and take because it just has to be done you're never gonna have purism you're
[02:14:11.560 --> 02:14:17.800]  again you're never gonna have absolutism so so this is nice oh we'll investigate the ngo's will
[02:14:17.800 --> 02:14:22.600]  you greg will people get arrested will people get fined you've said you're gonna shut down the border
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:29.000]  in texas for years you haven't done it so you've taken some good actions you've said a lot of good
[02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:35.560]  stuff you're like 10 of where you should be see and it's all strategic but that's the problem with
[02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:42.680]  the republicans is they are too afraid of strategy that will lead to results because results leads to
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:49.320]  pushback they don't want the pushback so they put out ideas and never follow through because that
[02:14:49.320 --> 02:14:53.640]  gives them political support and it gets them support in the media but they don't actually
[02:14:53.640 --> 02:14:57.400]  ever follow through and of course it's info wars are a few other people out there that actually
[02:14:57.400 --> 02:15:04.600]  try to hold them to task so no the strategy is pretty simple here at it stop letting illegal
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:11.720]  immigrants in and for the ones that come in we can have a certain system that says okay we'll
[02:15:11.720 --> 02:15:16.280]  send you to arizona we'll send you to new mexico we'll send it into new york you're not staying in
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:21.320]  texas if you come across the texas southern border there are two things that are going to happen to
[02:15:21.320 --> 02:15:27.960]  you either one you're going to be rejected straight up rejected or two you're going to be arrested
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:33.720]  and transferred to a different state us border city strained ahead of expected migrant surge
[02:15:33.720 --> 02:15:37.880]  yeah there's tens of thousands coming in tens of thousands of illegal migrants new caravan heading
[02:15:37.880 --> 02:15:42.600]  in it's easier for them to travel in the winter folks because it's not 90 hundred degrees it's easy
[02:15:42.600 --> 02:15:46.840]  for them to travel long distances with the 56 degree weather and so they're coming in so another
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:51.240]  example the house is on fire the country's burning down we all see it we all know it
[02:15:51.240 --> 02:15:55.480]  Abbott knows it he says something will he do anything about it i wouldn't hold your breath

[02:17:02.280 --> 02:17:09.400]  stolen day by day counting these mail-in ballots and it's absolutely absurd for anyone to take
[02:17:09.400 --> 02:17:16.200]  our election seriously when we we just it's election month alex it's not election day and
[02:17:16.200 --> 02:17:23.240]  that's the problem and everything changed after covid-19 they illegally changed state elections
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:29.640]  mailing ballots to anyone and everyone and sometimes mailing multiple ballots to people
[02:17:29.640 --> 02:17:34.280]  well this isn't any way to run an election we're in a serious country when we have elections that
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:39.960]  can be stolen like this and i believe that just like i believe the election was stolen in 2020
[02:17:39.960 --> 02:17:45.800]  and i have no problem saying that and it's it is so absurd for the media and the democrats to attack
[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:52.680]  us that that question our election integrity and question the the fact that elections shouldn't be
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:59.720]  run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election realists once a tragedy reaches a
[02:17:59.720 --> 02:18:06.920]  level of national significance american citizens should be allowed to basically question that event
[02:18:06.920 --> 02:18:11.960]  in any way that they deemed fit the first amendment is unique in the world that's what they want to
[02:18:11.960 --> 02:18:16.120]  take away your ability to speak freely so they're going to go from michael indel next or they're
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:20.520]  going to go for steve bannon are going to go for tucker carlson i studied the globalist 30 years ago

[02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:42.280]  i just have trouble reporting on this stuff because it's so it it's just so corrupt it's
[02:20:42.280 --> 02:20:47.800]  just unbelievable how corrupt our government is specifically the democrat party more specifically
[02:20:47.800 --> 02:20:55.880]  this january 6 hearing jamie raskin who attempted to unlawfully stop certification of the 2016 election
[02:20:55.880 --> 02:21:00.920]  now announcing criminal referrals again so this is the same democrat party that denied al gore lost
[02:21:00.920 --> 02:21:07.480]  that denied hillary clinton lost that tried to stop those elections for being certified now
[02:21:07.480 --> 02:21:13.640]  saying it's criminal activity to do exactly what they did so they've now made criminal referrals
[02:21:13.640 --> 02:21:20.600]  to donald trump on multiple accounts of obstructing and official proceeding conspiracy to defraud the
[02:21:20.600 --> 02:21:27.240]  united states no that's the democrats that's the fbi perjury that's the big tech heads insurrection
[02:21:29.000 --> 02:21:34.840]  it's just ridiculous and then they say this these criminal referrals should stop
[02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:44.280]  trump from holding future office well there you go i'll tell you what uh to me the trump 2024 campaign
[02:21:44.280 --> 02:21:50.520]  was flatlining big time flatlining but it looks like the democrats have just put a little life back
[02:21:50.520 --> 02:21:59.240]  into it we got a little so the january 6 committee saying we have to make criminal referrals of
[02:21:59.240 --> 02:22:07.160]  donald trump for doing exactly what we tried to do four years before him and of course 16 years before
[02:22:07.160 --> 02:22:14.440]  that we're going to make criminal referrals to trump and therefore he shouldn't be able to run
[02:22:14.440 --> 02:22:22.040]  he shouldn't be able to hold public office ah and there it is you're reminded how much they fear
[02:22:22.040 --> 02:22:27.560]  donald trump you're reminded how much they hate donald trump and you're reminded how much of this
[02:22:27.560 --> 02:22:37.720]  is motivated just to get donald trump out of the way so there you go a little life the democrats
[02:22:37.720 --> 02:22:45.000]  the january 6 committee breathes a little life back into trump 2024 where he has been almost
[02:22:45.720 --> 02:22:48.360]  m i a as far as i'm concerned
[02:22:48.360 --> 02:22:57.400]  former trump economist larry kudlow omnibus bill created in the dark will skyrocket inflation
[02:22:57.400 --> 02:23:02.600]  yeah it's totally unprecedented what the democrats have done with this omnibus bill
[02:23:02.600 --> 02:23:06.920]  not just a number of dollars but there's presidents there's unwritten rules
[02:23:06.920 --> 02:23:16.600]  and you don't pass an omnibus spending bill after you lose seats in a midterm election
[02:23:18.280 --> 02:23:25.160]  which the democrats just did but they're going to do it anyway they give you two hours to read
[02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:30.360]  a 4 000 page bill i think it's like 37 billion dollars or something ridiculous
[02:23:32.040 --> 02:23:35.800]  and they say okay here's two hours read this 4 000 page bill and pass it now
[02:23:35.800 --> 02:23:43.640]  now and the only person i saw saying anything bad about it was rand paul and now larry kudlow
[02:23:44.440 --> 02:23:51.960]  trump's former economic advisor so it's just total corruption i mean we're just it's unbelievable man
[02:23:55.320 --> 02:24:01.800]  i really do wonder how this is all gonna end i really do wonder how it's all gonna end is it
[02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:11.480]  going to be 1776 2.0 american revolution 2.0 renaissance great awakening 2.0 3.0 whatever you
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:18.920]  want to say or is this it do our current politicians absolutely crush the united states completely
[02:24:20.200 --> 02:24:25.160]  putting us into indentured servitude with the synthetic debt in a world economy
[02:24:25.960 --> 02:24:31.160]  bringing us into the corporate world government social credit score take away our first amendment
[02:24:31.160 --> 02:24:36.600]  right second amendment right and everything else that follows because this status quo i mean there's
[02:24:36.600 --> 02:24:40.920]  just it's something has to give here it's just it it can't go on like this forever we can't
[02:24:40.920 --> 02:24:46.920]  deal with this government corruption or we'll all end up being killed or arrested by this current
[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:53.960]  government and so you know you just wonder how it ends and we'd like to peacefully politically
[02:24:53.960 --> 02:25:00.360]  restore the republic we'd like to peacefully politically bring back the american values ideals
[02:25:00.360 --> 02:25:09.000]  principles that were cemented into our country via the constitution and the bill of rights
[02:25:09.000 --> 02:25:13.880]  the declaration of independence that's what we'd like to see it doesn't seem our government has
[02:25:13.880 --> 02:25:21.560]  that in mind and most of the media not interested in that either no they're going to continue to
[02:25:21.560 --> 02:25:25.720]  run their sham hearings they're going to continue to run their sham pandemics they're going to
[02:25:25.720 --> 02:25:34.840]  continue to force inoculate you with their sham vaccines just everything a sham sham omnibus bill
[02:25:36.760 --> 02:25:42.280]  and you almost wonder did elon musk really think exposing all the corruption on twitter would
[02:25:42.280 --> 02:25:45.960]  render any results was he really that naive
[02:25:49.000 --> 02:25:52.200]  is twitter gonna have to go into bankruptcy what about tesla how's that going
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:59.080]  because i see a cat and mouse game going on here between elon musk and the deep state whether it
[02:25:59.080 --> 02:26:05.000]  was always going to be that way and he knew it or whether that's what it became after he took over
[02:26:05.000 --> 02:26:10.760]  twitter we see the government investigating him we see the government going after him personally
[02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:17.320]  we see them going after his businesses whether it's twitter whether it's neurolink whether it's
[02:26:17.320 --> 02:26:22.840]  tesla all being investigated by the government now so that's that game at cat and mouse he's
[02:26:22.840 --> 02:26:27.080]  showing the world how corrupt they are they're investigating and threatening him for showing
[02:26:27.080 --> 02:26:32.120]  the world how corrupt they are so has he made his final move and now he's just saying all right
[02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:38.680]  i've done my thing i've invested half of my life half of my fortune into doing this thought maybe
[02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:42.600]  we'd get some results thought maybe the american people would care more thought maybe the media
[02:26:42.600 --> 02:26:51.000]  would care more but it all kind of fell flat and i don't want to hear about oh don't say it fell flat
[02:26:51.000 --> 02:27:00.200]  people were talking about it it was the top story so what so what if everybody in my neighborhood
[02:27:00.760 --> 02:27:07.160]  is talking about my house being on fire but nobody takes any action and it burns to the ground
[02:27:07.160 --> 02:27:14.440]  i don't have a house anymore and guess what everybody knowing about my house being on fire
[02:27:14.440 --> 02:27:23.480]  didn't do a damn thing because they let it burn to the ground so that's like elon musk it's like
[02:27:23.480 --> 02:27:30.200]  oh my house on fire you call 911 hi i need the fire apartment my house is on fire and they
[02:27:30.200 --> 02:27:38.680]  never show up or they never answer the phone or they tell you they're not interested so
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:44.600]  was this always a game of cat and mouse with elon musk in the deep state did he genuinely
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:48.760]  think he could get in there and expose all the corruption not even realizing that there would
[02:27:48.760 --> 02:27:55.320]  be little to no interest from the politicians or the media and so now he's just like okay well i mean
[02:27:55.320 --> 02:28:02.520]  i i invested half my value and my my life savings into this but i guess americans don't care that
[02:28:02.520 --> 02:28:06.680]  their country is getting stolen from them so i'll just go on to make more cars and rocket ships
[02:28:08.520 --> 02:28:13.400]  or was the cat and mouse game and now he's getting them to back off some of their stuff against him
[02:28:14.600 --> 02:28:21.880]  but a couple other news headlines coming up regarding that on the other side of this break
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:28.280]  where clearly again whether musk intended on it or not there's been a game of cat and mouse going on
[02:28:28.280 --> 02:28:33.960]  between musk and the deep state because they're threatening to shut down his businesses he's
[02:28:33.960 --> 02:28:38.440]  threatening to show the world how corrupt they are which should shut them down except the problem is
[02:28:38.440 --> 02:28:42.520]  he showed the world how corrupt the fbi was he showed the world how corrupt the media and the
[02:28:42.520 --> 02:28:47.400]  democrat party was the response on the american people should have been much stronger it wasn't
[02:28:47.400 --> 02:28:54.280]  and so now musk is the one at risk from the deep state and yet the deep state is going to get away
[02:28:54.280 --> 02:29:01.560]  with all of it yet again ladies and gentlemen we are now launching the most powerful supplements in

[02:32:03.480 --> 02:32:08.360]  i had brain fog like you wouldn't believe i was barely holding on to a job and i heard
[02:32:08.360 --> 02:32:12.520]  dr group on your show and i listened to it so the first one i got was the original survival
[02:32:12.520 --> 02:32:17.240]  shield the x1 and it worked pretty good and then shortly thereafter you came out with that too you
[02:32:17.240 --> 02:32:21.000]  had you know with a deep burn source you know and i got really excited about that so i took it and
[02:32:21.000 --> 02:32:27.480]  man in two weeks i went from brain fog to like literally like my brain was enlightened you know
[02:32:27.480 --> 02:32:32.760]  i could think again i could connect with people again and over the course of the next couple of
[02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:37.640]  years i got my health back and i religiously take basically all of your supplements they're all
[02:32:37.640 --> 02:32:42.120]  absolutely amazing supplements the one i like recently is knockout it literally like if you
[02:32:42.120 --> 02:32:46.840]  want to sleep just take it it's amazing it works but anyway so the point is we have to get ourselves
[02:32:46.840 --> 02:32:51.320]  clean we have to break free of the globalist system and the only way to do that is to take
[02:32:51.320 --> 02:32:56.520]  our own health into our own hands beautifully said brother i thank you so much for calling godspeed
[02:32:56.520 --> 02:33:15.320]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[02:33:15.320 --> 02:33:25.240]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex joneshow with owin shroyer
[02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:36.600]  all right the shim january 6 hearing goes on nobody's paying attention anymore because it's just
[02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:42.280]  it's it's it's joked itself off the stage but they're still out there doing it people just don't
[02:33:42.280 --> 02:33:46.920]  realize they're still trying to destroy this country many of them on their last political
[02:33:46.920 --> 02:33:53.880]  legs like liz chaney and adam kinsinger using their final their final gas their final run their
[02:33:53.880 --> 02:33:59.880]  final legs to help destroy this country to help the democrat party and to go after trump and so
[02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:04.760]  the select committee votes nine to nothing oh shocker to recommend the department of justice
[02:34:04.760 --> 02:34:09.000]  prosecute donald trump on four separate criminal charges aiding or assisting an insurrection
[02:34:09.000 --> 02:34:14.280]  oh yeah he told people to go home he said be peaceful he had a speech he's the president oh okay
[02:34:15.160 --> 02:34:19.240]  that's amazing the president engaging in an insurrection telling people to be peaceful
[02:34:19.240 --> 02:34:25.000]  i see obstruction of an official proceeding wasn't even there literally was not even there
[02:34:25.000 --> 02:34:30.920]  in the building in the capital that day was not even there conspiracy to make false statements
[02:34:30.920 --> 02:34:38.440]  oh false statements boy where oh imagine that applied fairly and equally conspiracy to defraud
[02:34:38.440 --> 02:34:44.440]  the usa i mean just all total bs so clearly they're still deathly afraid of trump i mean
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:49.640]  that if that if that's what this tells you right here this deep state these crooks these these
[02:34:51.320 --> 02:34:55.240]  i mean i'm trying to lower my i'm gonna lower my i'm about to get really angry here i'm about
[02:34:55.240 --> 02:35:05.960]  to blow a gasket i'm gonna just calm down here these these bastards these rat bastards these
[02:35:05.960 --> 02:35:13.320]  sons of bitches clearly still fear donald trump and you know it's almost comical because we're
[02:35:13.320 --> 02:35:19.080]  sitting here like the donald trump that we know and love the donald trump that we first voted for
[02:35:19.080 --> 02:35:23.720]  we don't even know if he exists anymore like we don't even know if trump is our guy at this point
[02:35:24.440 --> 02:35:28.520]  but then here they come to remind you how much they hate him and how much they fear him
[02:35:29.480 --> 02:35:33.240]  and you say okay well this is why we supported him this is why we wanted him in there in the
[02:35:33.240 --> 02:35:42.040]  first place so what comes next who moves next in this game of chicken will the doj move to get trump
[02:35:42.040 --> 02:35:49.640]  before the 118th congress or will this demand for trump to be criminally charged by the doj
[02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:56.520]  fall flat and then maybe we will see the pendulum go the other way with the 118th congress i still
[02:35:56.520 --> 02:36:06.040]  don't have much hope for that but i do have some hope just a little just a smidgen now quick programming
[02:36:06.040 --> 02:36:11.240]  note i'm going to be hosting the war room today as well jerald solente is going to be hosting the
[02:36:11.240 --> 02:36:17.960]  fourth hour of the joneshow coming up in about 30 minutes and i do intend to take calls your
[02:36:17.960 --> 02:36:24.200]  response to the elon muskpole and your response to the donald trump criminal referral by the
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:27.640]  january 6 committee but we're going to have to wait till later on in the war room because
[02:36:27.640 --> 02:36:30.920]  i do have some other news still to cover but just want to give that quick programming note
[02:36:31.800 --> 02:36:40.520]  also before we move on with the news coverage i told you why i start every morning with vitamin
[02:36:40.520 --> 02:36:47.080]  mineral fusion i'm not going to tell you again i've read the nutrition or the supplement facts
[02:36:47.080 --> 02:36:52.920]  here on the air for you that's why i start every day with vitamin mineral fusion but it's 50% off
[02:36:52.920 --> 02:36:58.360]  it's selling out quick at infowarstore.com but i want to tell you about something else here
[02:36:59.000 --> 02:37:06.200]  and i was not aware that this was going to happen and i'm excited it is the real red pill plus is
[02:37:06.200 --> 02:37:13.400]  back this used to be a regular thing for me with my supplement routine every morning was the real
[02:37:13.400 --> 02:37:19.800]  red pill plus and i've actually had to get a different supplement because really it was the
[02:37:19.800 --> 02:37:26.840]  pregnant alone in there that works so hand in glove with dna force plus which is why i really
[02:37:26.840 --> 02:37:32.440]  liked it but i mean the vitamin k is also huge the urbimate gives you a little bit of an energy
[02:37:32.440 --> 02:37:39.160]  so there's all kinds of great things in here but really it's the pregnant alone it's the vitamin k
[02:37:39.160 --> 02:37:44.920]  and then it's just the mixture of everything else with the zinc and the magnesium that makes this
[02:37:44.920 --> 02:37:52.440]  supplement so special the real red pill plus is back at infowarstore.com and 50% off
[02:37:53.560 --> 02:37:57.720]  and so this is going to be going right back into my morning supplement routine
[02:37:58.280 --> 02:38:02.760]  glad we finally have been able to get the red pill plus the real red pill plus back in stock
[02:38:02.760 --> 02:38:09.480]  this is a serious game changer and i will be adding it back to my morning supplement routine
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:18.280]  in light of this news today all right here's the rest of that musk news i was talking about
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:24.760]  e-u threatens to sanction elon musk's twitter over temporary suspension of media journalist
[02:38:24.760 --> 02:38:40.600]  oh man that's funny that's funny so when twitter was censoring hundreds if not thousands if not

[02:47:05.080 --> 02:47:13.080]  you
[02:47:21.560 --> 02:47:27.240]  you know who's the president of the united states did you forget it's joe biden what's he been up to
[02:47:27.240 --> 02:47:34.920]  lately nobody knows but when he does show his face and talk you know he's lying or sniffing
[02:47:34.920 --> 02:47:42.200]  a little girl in fact there was the only thing i saw from biden last week what was this girl's name
[02:47:42.200 --> 02:47:48.520]  there was some asian girl who went to the white house it was part of the the uh the big gay marriage
[02:47:48.520 --> 02:47:53.480]  celebration heard there was an orgya in the basement afterwards uh you know they all like
[02:47:53.480 --> 02:48:03.080]  getting that access doing a little uh jfk tunneling and so she made a joke though how
[02:48:03.080 --> 02:48:09.400]  she let biden sniff her hair and so it's like even the liberals that support this guy knows
[02:48:09.400 --> 02:48:14.280]  the completely perverted creep but that's all i've seen from buying the last seven days so
[02:48:14.280 --> 02:48:19.400]  you've got a president missing in action who knows what his deal is is he healthy is he is he is he
[02:48:19.400 --> 02:48:26.680]  sick is he getting blood transfusions is he in a hyperbaric chamber you know i don't know what
[02:48:26.680 --> 02:48:35.160]  he's doing but i do know he's lying when he talks everything biden says is made up i you know i was
[02:48:35.160 --> 02:48:39.160]  hoping somebody would just straight up put the list out of all the things he's just completely
[02:48:39.160 --> 02:48:44.280]  made up i'm not talking about political lies or stuff i mean just stories he's made up just
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:50.360]  completely made up yeah there it is tiffani fong you know tiffani you're a pretty attractive girl
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:57.800]  but uh you're not really biden's type it looks like you're actually over 18 and so i'm not sure
[02:48:57.800 --> 02:49:01.480]  you're really biden's type you may have to actually ask him to sniff your hair he probably didn't
[02:49:01.480 --> 02:49:09.080]  volunteer that um but you know that's just another story everything biden says is made up
[02:49:09.080 --> 02:49:15.000]  he's been a truck driver a lumberyard worker a university professor a gang busting lifeguard
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:22.280]  a rider of amtrak trains a civil rights protester and he even got arrested trying to bust nelson
[02:49:22.280 --> 02:49:29.480]  mandela out of prison once but of course none of these things are real he did it again this weekend
[02:49:29.480 --> 02:49:36.760]  though biden claimed that he's been to afghanistan and iraq up to 40 times and twice as president
[02:49:36.760 --> 02:49:44.520]  but in reality he went to those countries only half that amount of times and not once as president
[02:49:46.040 --> 02:49:50.600]  he then claimed he had an uncle who personally who he personally awarded with a purple heart
[02:49:50.600 --> 02:49:57.160]  while he was vice president except he didn't he just straight up didn't uh so i don't know how
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:06.600]  you make that one up wow so this is joe biden for you he just makes things up just whole cloth
[02:50:08.520 --> 02:50:15.640]  it's a fun game we could all play it yeah guys you should have seen me i i was the i was the
[02:50:16.200 --> 02:50:25.080]  mvp of the i've had quite a year actually i was the super bowl mvp okay i was the super bowl mvp
[02:50:25.080 --> 02:50:35.240]  in february and then this weekend yesterday i was actually competing in the world cup for argentina
[02:50:35.240 --> 02:50:42.040]  i won the world cup yesterday i was on the field dancing and celebrating with leonel messy and the
[02:50:43.000 --> 02:50:49.400]  argentinian soccer team and that's been my year i won the super bowl and then i won the world cup
[02:50:49.400 --> 02:50:56.520]  i've had a hell of a year me and joe biden let's talk about joe biden's millionth embarrassing gaff
[02:50:57.960 --> 02:51:01.080]  yeah he's the gaff president he's the disappearing act president
[02:51:02.600 --> 02:51:08.040]  and everybody knows he just lies about everything or does he lie or does he genuinely have no idea
[02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:13.560]  where he is maybe both biden plans to celebrate his so-called great achievements before christmas
[02:51:13.560 --> 02:51:20.200]  i wonder what that's going to be what does he got uh he's got less than a week now i wonder what
[02:51:20.200 --> 02:51:25.400]  the accomplishments will be uh gay marriage and uh well he'll say that he lowered gas prices which
[02:51:25.400 --> 02:51:30.600]  he didn't do so okay and he didn't do gay marriage either actually ironically enough he didn't do
[02:51:30.600 --> 02:51:36.120]  either one of those things so he'll he'll he'll claim he got you gay marriage and he'll claim
[02:51:36.120 --> 02:51:44.680]  me lowered gas prices he did neither of the two amazing stuff joe manchin refuses to answer whether
[02:51:44.680 --> 02:51:50.040]  he is going to leave the democrat party or not interesting to me that means yes he would have
[02:51:50.040 --> 02:51:54.280]  said no unless he's thinking about it how could anybody not want to leave this party there's
[02:51:54.280 --> 02:52:00.600]  creepy uncle joe there he is some people don't even think it's the real biden
[02:52:00.600 --> 02:52:07.960]  is there is no real biden that's the joke republicans fear of mccarthy speaker bid may fumble and
[02:52:07.960 --> 02:52:14.040]  disappoint voters oh my gosh that's go thank god the republicans are on top of it guys
[02:52:14.840 --> 02:52:20.840]  they haven't they haven't they have no idea the temperature of the room they have no idea of
[02:52:20.840 --> 02:52:27.400]  anything that's going on uh hi we'd like some action as far as the election being stolen from
[02:52:27.400 --> 02:52:31.880]  trump oh i forgot you're not allowed to say that you're a bunch of cowards too okay how about
[02:52:31.880 --> 02:52:36.760]  some action on the twitter files showing the democrat part in the fbi worked in collusion
[02:52:37.480 --> 02:52:41.720]  to censor trump voters and censor the hunter biden laptop story in lie to us about it anything on
[02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:48.200]  that no nothing okay how about joe biden opening up the border five million plus illegal immigrants
[02:52:48.200 --> 02:52:53.800]  anything there no nothing from the republicans okay okay and then they though the democrats
[02:52:53.800 --> 02:52:58.440]  continue their big january 6 sham hearing and uh what do we get from our republicans
[02:53:00.520 --> 02:53:05.800]  nothing that's what you get you get nothing i mean i understand why people want to be a democrat
[02:53:05.800 --> 02:53:09.080]  you get all the privileges you get liberal democrat privilege you know this whole white
[02:53:09.080 --> 02:53:13.640]  supremacy white privilege thing is actually a myth what you really have is democrat liberal
[02:53:13.640 --> 02:53:19.240]  supremacy democrat liberal privilege figure it out you be a conservative for a year see what
[02:53:19.240 --> 02:53:24.440]  kind of privileges you get or you be a white person see what kind of privileges you get you go be a
[02:53:24.440 --> 02:53:30.680]  liberal democrat for a year you'll realize you can just you can do whatever you want and you'll be
[02:53:30.680 --> 02:53:36.760]  just fine now there's some noise coming from the republicans here i've got a small hope that it
[02:53:36.760 --> 02:53:47.960]  amounts to much gop to release 100 page rebuttal to january 6th in the 100 page page plus rebuttal
[02:53:47.960 --> 02:53:55.000]  jim banks alleges that the capitol hill police and the fbi were underprepared noting that the january
[02:53:55.000 --> 02:53:59.800]  6 panel has never dealt with such serious issues linked to security at the capital that day jim
[02:53:59.800 --> 02:54:05.240]  you're smarter than that not only were the capitol hill police and the fbi underprepared it was by
[02:54:05.240 --> 02:54:10.760]  design and not only is the january 6 panel not serious dealing with these issues they have no
[02:54:10.760 --> 02:54:15.000]  interest in dealing with those issues they don't want to deal with those issues those are their
[02:54:15.000 --> 02:54:20.600]  issues so i mean if that's the pushback we're getting from the republicans get ready to drown
[02:54:21.720 --> 02:54:28.280]  get ready to be in the middle of the ocean without a lifeboat north carolina supreme court rules voter
[02:54:28.280 --> 02:54:34.920]  ids are racist because minority groups don't know how to get ids i guess is the argument there but
[02:54:34.920 --> 02:54:43.000]  of course north carolina becoming a strong red state so get ready i'll tell you right here in
[02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:52.760]  charlotte and probably ashville last i checked those were the two two bluest areas in north
[02:54:52.760 --> 02:54:59.000]  carolina i believe are charlotte and ashville and you watch both of those areas will have a
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:06.520]  significant increase in votes ahead of the next election and it will be not your normal
[02:55:07.320 --> 02:55:11.400]  percentage it'll it'll be an anomaly say let's say there's an average of four or five percent
[02:55:11.400 --> 02:55:17.240]  increase in votes steadily for like the last five years it'll be 10 15 percent and that'll be the
[02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:21.800]  total valet ballot harvesting done by the democrats that they're about to do in north carolina
[02:55:21.800 --> 02:55:28.440]  ahead of 2024 so republicans hi uh do you want to see north carolina become arizona do you want
[02:55:28.440 --> 02:55:32.760]  to see north carolina become georgia do you want to see north carolina become pennsylvania
[02:55:32.760 --> 02:55:39.240]  michigan wisconsin minnesota uh because that's what the democrats are about to do i'm telling
[02:55:39.240 --> 02:55:43.640]  you they're telling you right here you want to listen to info wars maybe for once in your life

[02:56:00.280 --> 02:56:05.560]  representative mike turner house intelligence committee will seek fbi secret files using subpoena

[02:56:40.680 --> 02:56:44.600]  the push back and you know telling them to go shove it where the sun don't shine let them know
[02:56:44.600 --> 02:56:54.680]  we're not afraid of them anymore but do we just completely abandon any sort of reverence or or
[02:56:54.680 --> 02:57:00.600]  class when it comes to our political discussions and debates and deliberations because that's
[02:57:00.600 --> 02:57:05.960]  quickly where it's going and i don't know if i'm ready for that to be the case because i don't
[02:57:05.960 --> 02:57:12.360]  think that's good for anybody however that's not the republicans that did that it's the democrats
[02:57:12.360 --> 02:57:16.520]  that did that they're the ones that ruined the conversation they're the ones that flipped the
[02:57:16.520 --> 02:57:21.160]  table over they're the ones saying men can get pregnant they're the ones saying trans kids is
[02:57:21.160 --> 02:57:25.720]  gender affirming surgery so they've already changed the standards they've already lowered the bar it's
[02:57:25.720 --> 02:57:32.680]  already a filthy disgusting slobberknocker maybe now the republicans are just ready to actually
[02:57:32.680 --> 02:57:37.720]  fight maybe now it's time hey they not only did the democrat the democrats didn't take the gloves off

[02:59:58.440 --> 03:00:20.920]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 you're listening to the alex jones show with gerald solente
[03:00:20.920 --> 03:00:31.240]  on the alex jones show we wish you a merry christmas we wish you a merry christmas
[03:00:31.240 --> 03:00:37.080]  no merry christmas is allowed all right all right take it easy all right because hey it's
[03:00:37.080 --> 03:00:42.040]  christmas time and in christmas time it's about the prince of peace that's right the prince of
[03:00:42.040 --> 03:00:51.480]  peace but not a peep about peace you know it was an article in today's uh wall street journal
[03:00:51.480 --> 03:00:57.800]  catholic ideological split widens so i started reading it i i when i was raised in catholic
[03:00:57.800 --> 03:01:03.080]  but you know not my trip man but they did to me i told you about a nun beating me up in the fifth
[03:01:03.080 --> 03:01:08.920]  grade worth perforating my middle ear breaking my eardrum i used to go waterskiing in the hudson
[03:01:08.920 --> 03:01:14.520]  river at 10 years old it's just a belt on going over the wakes of ships when there are ships going
[03:01:14.520 --> 03:01:21.240]  up and down on a slalom almost being doing a 180 you can no longer get my ears wet the rest of my
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:27.560]  life but as i say you know it could have been worse anyway i want to mention this because
[03:01:27.560 --> 03:01:33.160]  u.s catholic bishops elected conservative leaders last month continuing to resist a push from pope
[03:01:33.160 --> 03:01:39.720]  frances to put issues such as climate change and poverty on par with bishops declaration
[03:01:40.360 --> 03:01:46.520]  the clear priority of opposing abortion okay hey it's christmas time how about peace
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:55.720]  where where are you catholic priests out there again i was raised catholic so i could say what
[03:01:55.720 --> 03:02:04.600]  i want to say from what i've gone through oh by the way sister marie rosea may she rot in hell
[03:02:05.560 --> 03:02:11.880]  also left me back in the fifth grade so i was the stupidest kid in the school and you could see
[03:02:11.880 --> 03:02:19.080]  she was a hundred percent correct you know i amounted to nothing you know oh yeah jesus christ
[03:02:19.080 --> 03:02:24.440]  would have loved you sister marie rosea bam bam bam bam bam holding me by my little blue tie
[03:02:24.440 --> 03:02:29.800]  that's my stop wearing ties after that man so anyway where are you where are the catholics
[03:02:29.800 --> 03:02:35.400]  talking about priests hey you got locked your you got locked your you don't talk about peace
[03:02:35.400 --> 03:02:43.160]  where are all you catholic priests it's christmas time christmas time birth of the prince of peace
[03:02:43.160 --> 03:02:49.720]  birth of the prince of peace but you are pieces of not the prince of peace anyway moving on i was
[03:02:49.720 --> 03:02:53.960]  listening to oh and before i went on and he's talking about the difference between republicans
[03:02:53.960 --> 03:02:59.320]  and the democrats how about the difference that went between the floods and the crypts
[03:03:01.400 --> 03:03:12.360]  i mean look at her there he is they just passed a bill right was it 180 almost 150 billion dollars
[03:03:13.080 --> 03:03:17.800]  for the defense budget republicans voted for only 11 people voted against it
[03:03:17.800 --> 03:03:25.080]  how could you look up to the republicans you know how could you look up to a mitch mcconnell
[03:03:26.360 --> 03:03:34.120]  a rinsey graham the whole corrupt it's a corrupt system of morons and imbeciles telling us what

[03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:53.160]  oh and his wife was in on those deals too making the deals and betting on the markets when things
[03:03:53.160 --> 03:04:03.640]  went on we need a new third party no other way about it they got a perfect track record of murdering
[03:04:03.640 --> 03:04:10.600]  people all over the planet and stealing our dough to gift it and buddies and to gift it themselves
[03:04:11.480 --> 03:04:16.840]  hey mitchie boy how when it was the last real job you had don't forget to roll out the right

[03:06:25.560 --> 03:06:31.640]  you better do all you can to support info wars because censorship is the word
[03:06:31.640 --> 03:06:38.280]  you imagine that all this big news about twitter that we have to rely on a twitter or facebook or
[03:06:38.280 --> 03:06:50.520]  youtube to put out the information to the general public how can we do something like this
[03:06:53.000 --> 03:07:01.000]  this is terrible that we have to rely on these monopolies it was this guy that did this
[03:07:01.000 --> 03:07:06.680]  article in consortium news which is a great source by the way and john lory is doing a great job
[03:07:06.680 --> 03:07:15.000]  i forgot his name and he mentioned that you know we call these people over there in russia
[03:07:15.560 --> 03:07:19.560]  oligarchs oligarchs they're closing down they're taking a yacht of the oligarch
[03:07:21.000 --> 03:07:23.880]  how about bezos is that an oligarch
[03:07:26.280 --> 03:07:27.400]  an ugly gawk
[03:07:30.200 --> 03:07:34.760]  how about his yacht remember and was it norway or some belgium or someplace they had a
[03:07:34.760 --> 03:07:39.640]  i think it was belgium they they wanted to take down a bridge so his yacht could go through
[03:07:40.760 --> 03:07:47.160]  how about that oligarch so going back to the repulsive kins and the demo craps
[03:07:47.720 --> 03:07:50.040]  they've robbed us of our freedom and liberty
[03:07:52.600 --> 03:07:57.160]  they did away with the robber's apartment act sherman antitrust act clayton antitrust act less
[03:07:57.160 --> 03:08:03.880]  legal act that makes the bigs the bigger all we become a plantation workers on slave landia
[03:08:03.880 --> 03:08:10.040]  so i don't want to hear a word i will go up against anybody anywhere in the country
[03:08:12.040 --> 03:08:18.440]  of what criminals and lowlife scum the majority
[03:08:21.560 --> 03:08:29.400]  of the crime syndicate running america today republicans and democrats oh just passed an
[03:08:29.400 --> 03:08:37.400]  800 what and 50 billion 60 billion dollar defense budget yeah yeah we gotta keep killing people
[03:08:38.520 --> 03:08:43.800]  hey you like vietnam i loved it every day wake up and they're gonna get me they're gonna get me
[03:08:43.800 --> 03:08:51.400]  now i like the iraq war we're gonna get that guy sonam we see get alive he tried to my daddy
[03:08:51.400 --> 03:08:54.520]  yeah dumb enough to believe that crap how about the afghan war
[03:08:54.520 --> 03:09:01.000]  war oh no i'm sorry that was we're gonna get that guy osama bin laden dead or alive at the afghan
[03:09:01.000 --> 03:09:05.480]  war we're gonna get sit on who's saying because he has weapons of mass destruction and ties
[03:09:05.480 --> 03:09:12.040]  targeted we're told the lie and he tried to kill my daddy i got a mixed up and now we got the
[03:09:12.040 --> 03:09:23.320]  ukraine war so going back and listening to what what uh owen was saying here's my solution
[03:09:23.320 --> 03:09:31.240]  a new third party and we could win because owen also said how about the republican supporters
[03:09:31.240 --> 03:09:37.000]  are different than the republicans party yeah they want they want life liberty and a pursuit
[03:09:37.000 --> 03:09:41.880]  of happiness that's what they're fighting for but they don't have the representatives to
[03:09:41.880 --> 03:09:48.360]  to do that for them so how do we get them and how do we get the true what used to be called
[03:09:48.360 --> 03:09:59.640]  democrats that hate war and hate robbing our money to give to the bigs here's my solution
[03:09:59.640 --> 03:10:05.240]  you ready send 2995 to solutions i'm only kidding only kidding take it
[03:10:09.400 --> 03:10:11.320]  for president of the united states
[03:10:11.320 --> 03:10:19.080]  rfk jr
[03:10:22.680 --> 03:10:25.000]  the vice president of the united states
[03:10:27.960 --> 03:10:29.640]  judge andrew napolitano
[03:10:29.640 --> 03:10:42.200]  that's the way i say it two different guys not like the clowns that they play hey isn't
[03:10:42.200 --> 03:10:49.000]  camilla harris doing a great job wasn't pence wonderful yeah pence i got a pencil your pencil
[03:10:49.000 --> 03:10:57.000]  head we got now we have a judge andrew napolitano nobody anywhere could take this guy out on the
[03:10:57.000 --> 03:11:05.240]  constitution the bill of rights nobody that we've lost that these little clown heads that these
[03:11:05.240 --> 03:11:10.840]  little chucky schumas that these little mitchy mcconnells that's his little linsey grahams
[03:11:14.120 --> 03:11:20.120]  that this diane not so feinstein what a freak show that robbed it from us
[03:11:20.120 --> 03:11:32.600]  and rfk jr oh yeah fights for our freedom i was a keynote speaker at ron paul's event
[03:11:32.600 --> 03:11:41.640]  i think it was 2021 in september dc it was massy from kentucky the congressman uh
[03:11:41.640 --> 03:11:50.920]  uh judge andrew napolitano number two the fellow from uh the mesis institute who runs
[03:11:50.920 --> 03:11:55.320]  that well he was number two the palatino number three i was number four speaker
[03:11:56.360 --> 03:11:59.240]  and following me was rfk jr
[03:12:02.600 --> 03:12:08.280]  this is a guy that his god his father was assassinated
[03:12:08.280 --> 03:12:18.200]  his uncle was assassinating oh they just released some of the jfk papers but we the little moronic
[03:12:18.200 --> 03:12:23.000]  stupid ignorant people of slave landia we're just gonna feed us a little bit of the crap they won't
[03:12:23.000 --> 03:12:30.040]  put the whole thing out anyway this guy has lived through something could you imagine your
[03:12:30.040 --> 03:12:34.680]  father and uncle being assassinated your and your your father was running for president your
[03:12:34.680 --> 03:12:41.000]  your uncle was president this guy knows things that nobody knows and feels things that nobody feels
[03:12:43.320 --> 03:12:50.920]  and he came out against the vaccine people so as he's walking off the stage when we did
[03:12:50.920 --> 03:12:59.560]  the talk at um ron paul's event and there's no man alive by the way that i respect more than ron paul
[03:12:59.560 --> 03:13:06.920]  as rfk jr is walking off the stage you know he has that voice you know he's broken up he said
[03:13:08.280 --> 03:13:10.360]  i'll fight to my death for freedom
[03:13:15.320 --> 03:13:23.720]  how many people would say that i am palatino and see is people on info was are alex jones the
[03:13:23.720 --> 03:13:30.520]  crew and there are a number of good teams at jill lori i just said consortium news very few of us
[03:13:31.480 --> 03:13:34.360]  but rfk jr you live the life that nobody could imagine
[03:13:40.520 --> 03:13:47.560]  so that's my solution you do not expect the bloods in the crypts
[03:13:47.560 --> 03:13:55.480]  that people call republicans and democrats that's why i look at them the bloods in the crypts
[03:13:56.040 --> 03:14:01.160]  are going to do anything in our benefit they're only interested in their own egos
[03:14:02.760 --> 03:14:07.800]  and all the money that they could get without ever having to work a day in their life
[03:14:07.800 --> 03:14:14.440]  and tell us what to do a new third party is the only way to freedom that i see it
[03:14:14.440 --> 03:14:21.720]  you know i used to be on all the major media and one of the ways i got on besides calling the crash

[03:22:07.400 --> 03:22:13.560]  draft in vietnam and i by the way i was too stupid i believe i believe the propaganda
[03:22:13.560 --> 03:22:23.400]  uh that if we didn't stop the vietnamese china communist vietnamese the commies were going to
[03:22:23.400 --> 03:22:27.480]  take over all of age and before you know it was going to hit the kids she was in california i
[03:22:27.480 --> 03:22:32.360]  believed it the only reason i didn't want to go in is i'm looking at these pictures the guys walking
[03:22:32.360 --> 03:22:36.920]  up to water this high gone over their head on about 50 pounds of weight on their back any
[03:22:36.920 --> 03:22:41.880]  shot at is i don't want to do that so i went to i only went to college to beat the draft
[03:22:41.880 --> 03:22:47.720]  i want to know about the delicate testing and park chest in the Bronx when i got out of high
[03:22:47.720 --> 03:22:55.960]  school and i was born at park chest the hospital it's no longer there i got to my father one day
[03:22:55.960 --> 03:23:02.360]  i said listen papa so they're drifting everybody so what should i do i don't know he said uh but
[03:23:02.360 --> 03:23:07.320]  i taught you enough he said i got my own problems you take care of it and i ended up going to one
[03:23:07.320 --> 03:23:13.640]  of the only school i could get into a greaser from you know brother Bronx so he used to call us in
[03:23:13.640 --> 03:23:21.240]  those days slick black air pointy shoes school they used to call the pointy shoes pfcs whatever

[03:26:16.040 --> 03:26:22.520]  of the propaganda and how they're telling us the lies and how they tell us to hate ukraine
[03:26:22.520 --> 03:26:32.680]  no the russians rather see that see that paper here it is soviet threatens rockets at spy base
[03:26:35.560 --> 03:26:42.280]  city of kingston i found these up in the 1774 academy and reform attendant may 10th 1960
[03:26:43.560 --> 03:26:48.120]  so soviet threatens rockets at spy base so it looks like they're going to bomb
[03:26:48.120 --> 03:26:54.280]  a new american spy base and number one what the hell are we doing over there with a spy base but
[03:26:54.280 --> 03:27:00.600]  anyway let's say we had one in that area like we have them there now the soviet's are threatening
[03:27:01.560 --> 03:27:05.240]  soviet threatened rockets at spy base so here's the story
[03:27:07.880 --> 03:27:13.000]  warning made on new tries you ready Moscow ap
[03:27:13.000 --> 03:27:21.560]  me premium Nikita khrushchev warned monday night that soviet rockets will shoot down
[03:27:21.560 --> 03:27:31.400]  any more spy planes that venture over syria soil and his government would take appropriate
[03:27:31.400 --> 03:27:40.360]  countermeasures wait a minute you mean american planes of flying over soviet's union yeah that's
[03:27:40.360 --> 03:27:48.200]  right but the headline says soviet threatens rockets at spy bases which means it says that
[03:27:48.200 --> 03:28:01.000]  they're going to bomb american spy bases when it says the soviet premier also warned that
[03:28:01.000 --> 03:28:10.360]  soviet rockets will be turned against bases in any foreign countries that allow american planes to
[03:28:10.360 --> 03:28:21.960]  take off on spy missions over the soviet union so get those planes out of there and stop going
[03:28:21.960 --> 03:28:29.640]  over our country how about if the chinese had them down in mexico and the russians had them up in
[03:28:29.640 --> 03:28:37.960]  canada flying over the united states we would love it wouldn't we oh that's okay
[03:28:39.480 --> 03:28:47.000]  that's how propaganda we have no business this is about life liberty and a pursuit of happiness
[03:28:47.000 --> 03:28:53.720]  this is not the american spirit of our founding fathers so we come back when we talk about the

[03:44:42.920 --> 03:44:49.160]  the democrats to attack us that that question our election integrity and question the the fact that
[03:44:49.160 --> 03:44:55.320]  elections shouldn't be run the way they are we're not election deniers we're election realists

[03:47:35.160 --> 03:47:45.320]  here it must be that uh super male vitality they got me going yeah yeah now i'm a man's man i'm a
[03:47:45.320 --> 03:47:55.320]  fighter what close combat for many years i don't tell anybody what to do and nobody tells me what
[03:47:55.320 --> 03:48:03.080]  to do keep it even i'm an american i want to be free let's talk about the economy of course the
[03:48:03.080 --> 03:48:10.840]  retail sales fell in november 0.6 but when you put in inflation they don't have that number in there
[03:48:10.840 --> 03:48:17.800]  it's a lot deeper they say inflation is around 7.1 percent but it's really much worse than that
[03:48:17.800 --> 03:48:23.880]  because if you go to john william shadow stats you'll see that it's more like uh almost 15 percent
[03:48:25.000 --> 03:48:30.680]  so sales are going down and now with the raising interest rates it's going to go down even more
[03:48:33.080 --> 03:48:37.080]  but remember when all else fails they take it to war world war three has begun
[03:48:37.080 --> 03:48:42.600]  and it's only going to become official when there's a nuclear exchange of some false flag
[03:48:42.600 --> 03:48:51.480]  major event so the retail sales are going down and it's going to get a lot worse
[03:48:53.640 --> 03:49:01.880]  then this is a quote that was saying about uh what's his name there the the fed had
[03:49:01.880 --> 03:49:12.280]  uh powell and the rest saying that um why they're going to lower interest lower the slow down the
[03:49:12.280 --> 03:49:17.480]  economy by raising interest rates this is from jeremy seagull so this is from cnbc
[03:49:19.720 --> 03:49:27.560]  powell is doing an exact quote now he's saying here's supply supply side problems again that's
[03:49:27.560 --> 03:49:32.920]  what i said it's not supply side problems it's all the cheap money they dumped into the system
[03:49:34.040 --> 03:49:42.680]  between the biden and bush uh biden and bush biden and trump and the um fed keeping interest
[03:49:42.680 --> 03:49:50.440]  rates at zero so the merger and acquisition activity in 2021 with a big buyout everybody
[03:49:50.440 --> 03:49:55.560]  including houses and everything else it could become bigger merger and acquisition activity
[03:49:55.560 --> 03:50:01.240]  in 2021 was the highest on record so going back to this now he's saying there's a supply supply
[03:50:01.240 --> 03:50:11.160]  side problems meaning powell in the labor market that may raise wages and we have to crush the wages
[03:50:11.720 --> 03:50:22.440]  in order to stop inflation yeah i wasn't making it up i wasn't making it up the crooks in charge
[03:50:22.440 --> 03:50:28.600]  want to steal our money i wasn't making it up hey you know what i was thinking today we need
[03:50:28.600 --> 03:50:39.800]  another robin hood yeah we need another robin hood we got to change this system
[03:50:44.840 --> 03:50:47.240]  so that's what they're doing they're destroying the economy
[03:50:47.240 --> 03:50:56.440]  and the dow's down when i just got off the over 200 points is the market going to crash
[03:50:57.240 --> 03:51:02.920]  i have to give you the other side of it and how do you get the other side of it you go to
