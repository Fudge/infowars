[00:46.360 --> 00:50.920]  French court acquitted Kahn of aggravated pimping claiming that Kahn did not
[00:50.920 --> 00:55.640]  help operate in a legal prostitution network the Carlton affair is named
[00:55.640 --> 00:59.920]  after one of the hotels for businessmen and police officials allegedly

[01:05.080 --> 01:09.000]  he was present at the orgies attended by lawyers judges police officials and

[01:35.920 --> 01:40.920]  officers and staff at the Royal Palaces it would later be revealed that Prime
[01:40.920 --> 01:46.040]  Minister Margaret Thatcher's protege Leon Britain was at the center of the
[01:46.040 --> 01:50.480]  cover-up and was under investigation for raping a woman in sexually abusing
[01:50.480 --> 01:55.040]  boys up until his death this year he was back at the center of controversy last
[01:55.040 --> 02:00.480]  year amidst questions of his handling of allegations of sexual abuse when he was
[02:00.480 --> 02:05.640]  Home Secretary 30 years ago a sad day for the survivors of child sex abuse
[02:05.640 --> 02:10.160]  because they would have wanted to hear from Sir Leon Britain at this inquiry
[02:10.160 --> 02:14.800]  in terms of what he knew about the allegations that were made during the
[02:14.800 --> 02:21.800]  1980s in 2014 former Obama staffer Donnie Ray Williams pleaded guilty to
[02:21.800 --> 02:26.280]  raping two women he drug the first one with Ambien and raped the second one

[02:30.720 --> 02:35.400]  Williams suffered an acid attack to his face and body by an unknown man he used
[02:35.400 --> 02:39.760]  this attack as an excuse to sway the judge to give him five years probation
[02:39.760 --> 02:44.720]  rather than any prison time and this only scrapes the surface of the many
[02:44.720 --> 02:49.440]  allegations weighing on the overall perception of the ruling elite the

[08:55.800 --> 09:00.840]  angles and information concerning the tragic shooting
[09:00.840 --> 09:08.360]  Wednesday night in South Carolina and the deranged shooter who has now
[09:08.360 --> 09:13.800]  reportedly admitted that he did it and said that he wanted to start a race war
[09:13.800 --> 09:21.240]  well that's not hard to figure out so did Charlie Manson and then you've got
[09:21.240 --> 09:26.600]  the Turner Diaries written by Pierce and then you've got all the connections
[09:26.600 --> 09:31.520]  between those organizations and the globalist and the federal government and
[09:31.520 --> 09:35.760]  you've got the Democratic Party with its history of being the Ku Klux Klan they
[09:35.760 --> 09:41.400]  are now attempting to create basically Balkanization chaos here in the United
[09:41.400 --> 09:50.000]  States they're clearly pushing a racial conflagration in this country to
[09:50.000 --> 09:56.960]  divert off of the fact that Europe is in turmoil there are bank runs taking
[09:56.960 --> 10:01.440]  place there are open discussions of freezing bank accounts and the EU
[10:01.440 --> 10:07.320]  falling apart Ron Paul is in CNBC warning that the stock market day of
[10:07.320 --> 10:13.640]  reckoning is near the IMF trained Greek journalist in Washington to spend
[10:13.640 --> 10:23.440]  stories in favor of more bailouts to the banks elite financier George Soros
[10:23.440 --> 10:29.440]  warns of World War three again and says it's not an exaggeration
[10:29.440 --> 10:35.560]  meanwhile the United States is building anti cruise missile bases on the east
[10:35.560 --> 10:40.840]  and west coast preparing for submarine launched cruise missile attacks that's
[10:40.840 --> 10:48.160]  from defense one and it gets worse we talked about this last week Kurt
[10:48.160 --> 10:51.480]  Nemo wrote about it that the House Republican leadership was planning to
[10:51.480 --> 10:55.680]  try to pass fast track giving the president dictatorial power to sign us
[10:55.680 --> 11:00.680]  on to anything he wants for four years not just this president but the next
[11:00.680 --> 11:08.800]  well while we were busy ringing our hands over the nine dead in Charleston they
[11:08.800 --> 11:13.800]  passed fast track that we defeated Friday in the house now it's got to go
[11:13.800 --> 11:20.240]  back to the Senate but then if it passes there where it's already passed before
[11:20.240 --> 11:25.640]  it's a done deal this is a travesty and I was saying yesterday watch they're
[11:25.640 --> 11:29.560]  gonna try to ram this through while Obama's up there demonizing the Second
[11:29.560 --> 11:34.760]  Amendment because another drugged-up whack job probably got wound up by
[11:34.760 --> 11:41.920]  somebody undoubtedly went in and killed nine people that matter if 14 black
[11:41.920 --> 11:48.280]  people die a week on average in Chicago look it up 93% of them killed by their
[11:48.280 --> 11:53.480]  blacks doesn't matter you've got similar numbers in DC and other areas these
[11:53.480 --> 11:59.600]  nine will now be the martyrs and the collective white guilt to do the right
[11:59.600 --> 12:04.080]  thing and turn our guns in and accept open borders and just accept whatever
[12:04.080 --> 12:10.480]  we're told accept Obamacare were racist and Salon the White House front group
[12:10.480 --> 12:19.440]  White House manipulated White House controlled it's totally clear when we
[12:19.440 --> 12:22.920]  look at groups like media matters and then Salon just parrots whatever they
[12:22.920 --> 12:31.800]  say white America must answer for the Charleston church massacre white America
[12:31.800 --> 12:36.000]  it doesn't matter if blacks commit eight times more crimes against whites per
[12:36.000 --> 12:41.520]  capita and the FBI's own numbers it doesn't matter if there is a criminal
[12:41.520 --> 12:46.600]  culture that is in a minority of blacks but still substantive that is seen as
[12:46.600 --> 12:52.520]  cool and to go physically attack or shoot or kill a white person or a Hispanic
[12:52.520 --> 12:58.040]  or an Asian I mean it's pushed in black culture even by religious leaders to
[12:58.040 --> 13:05.160]  attack Asians Asians are the most hated I guess on that totem pole and that
[13:05.160 --> 13:11.040]  supposedly is acceptable it's not acceptable when the dirt bag went into
[13:11.040 --> 13:15.900]  the black church and shot nine people and it's not acceptable when a black
[13:15.900 --> 13:21.080]  dirt bag goes out and shoots some white people but the media calls it the knockout
[13:21.080 --> 13:25.800]  game it's just a game when you go out and find an old white person and walk up
[13:25.800 --> 13:29.000]  and sucker punch him and then their head hits the concrete and their head bust
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.440]  open and they die it's kind of cute and funny because you know the cracker
[13:33.440 --> 13:41.920]  deserved it some cracker probably poorer than you are and we can't deport the 36
[13:41.920 --> 13:45.320]  thousand illegals they just released with felony backgrounds who mainly feed
[13:45.320 --> 13:50.120]  on Hispanics because that would be racist you're an arson you're a rapist
[13:50.120 --> 13:55.640]  you're a hit-and-run you've been in two three four times it's okay and by the way
[13:55.640 --> 14:00.680]  right now they're trying to ram through total blanket amnesty and Obama's
[14:00.680 --> 14:06.360]  giving out tips on how to get worker visas and they're advertising on seeing
[14:06.360 --> 14:14.040]  in hey China come here have your babies it's all free to where now Chinese are
[14:14.040 --> 14:18.120]  the biggest immigrants to the US and almost all these new immigrants are
[14:18.120 --> 14:25.160]  not skilled laborers they are welfare tourists coming here to milk the joke of
[14:25.160 --> 14:30.920]  a system we've got and why not it's advertised you get a plane ticket here
[14:30.920 --> 14:36.240]  we'll give you a visa get on a plane come here your baby everything's free and
[14:36.240 --> 14:41.040]  that baby's a citizen you get full welfare you get to stay am I against
[14:41.040 --> 14:46.360]  Chinese people no I against Mexicans no am I against all the Eastern Europeans
[14:46.360 --> 14:50.680]  moving in here to also milk the welfare no am I against the Africans coming in
[14:50.680 --> 14:55.760]  here to milk the welfare no but then I see African immigrants and others on
[14:55.760 --> 15:00.320]  Facebook and Twitter and info wars today saying I'm an African immigrant and I'm
[15:00.320 --> 15:06.320]  telling you whites are the problem you all need to be killed because racism is
[15:06.320 --> 15:11.440]  sold as cool by the Democratic Party and other socialist parties around the
[15:11.440 --> 15:18.120]  world as long as it's against white people because white people were the
[15:18.120 --> 15:23.400]  predominant middle class and were the West so they've got to be bullied into
[15:23.400 --> 15:27.520]  turning power over to the globalist who were just the dominant white people
[15:27.520 --> 15:34.480]  whether they be Jewish or German or Scots or English or Dutch that's who's
[15:34.480 --> 15:38.520]  dominant and they sit there playing us all off against each other while they
[15:38.520 --> 15:43.920]  live in armored compounds or in island redoubts
[15:44.280 --> 15:53.480]  keeps castles fortresses and now a friend of accused South Carolina shooter
[15:53.480 --> 15:58.760]  claims he wanted to start a race war you've got that clip coming up after the
[15:58.760 --> 16:05.240]  break I'm telling you this is a Charlie Manson deal I said that yesterday this
[16:05.240 --> 16:09.480]  is a Charlie Manson start a race war period this is meant to start a race
[16:09.480 --> 16:14.680]  war and now you know that's what happened whether he's a cutout whether
[16:14.680 --> 16:21.000]  he's drugged up undoubtedly someone was handling him someone was preparing him
[16:21.000 --> 16:27.560]  someone was winding him up and I said yesterday a trying to start a race war
[16:27.560 --> 16:37.600]  and be if he's on amnesics then it goes from maybe it's a false flag to we got a
[16:37.600 --> 16:43.880]  really investigated now it could be and sure enough the story's been top linked
[16:43.880 --> 16:47.440]  on drugs since yesterday it's gone viral all we did was go to the police
[16:47.440 --> 16:51.800]  statements no one else had covered it where they admitted he was on the amnesic
[16:51.800 --> 17:01.040]  schedule three narcotic prescribed by a doctor and he'd been in and out of the
[17:01.040 --> 17:09.840]  system for years and this drug causes people to be horribly aggressive to
[17:09.840 --> 17:19.720]  become violent to commit suicide suboxone and I've talked to two people in my
[17:19.720 --> 17:27.200]  office who've had family both of which died recently well Joe Jennings said he
[17:27.200 --> 17:31.400]  talked about it his dad was on it and one other person told me about it but
[17:31.400 --> 17:35.360]  didn't want me to say their name and it made their family member have a lot of
[17:35.360 --> 17:38.320]  problems I'm gonna leave it at that I mean Joe you can pop in if you feel like
[17:38.320 --> 17:41.160]  it later and talk about it you know your father recently died so it's hard for
[17:41.160 --> 17:45.160]  you to talk about but this is the whacked out stuff they've got people on and you
[17:45.160 --> 17:48.760]  can argue well the drug didn't do it they were already whacked out whatever you
[17:48.760 --> 17:57.560]  put a crazy person on a hardcore drug unless it's lithium they're going to
[17:57.560 --> 18:02.320]  end up whacking out I mean every time I hear about somebody randomly killing
[18:02.320 --> 18:06.760]  their kids or randomly shooting a cop every time they're on a cocktail of this
[18:06.760 --> 18:13.600]  crap every time every time every mass shooting every one of a Harris and
[18:13.600 --> 18:20.800]  Clybold and Kip Kinkel and the the the cutout shooter from Sandy Hook just
[18:20.800 --> 18:27.600]  every time it says in the insert we may become violent smashing things and
[18:27.600 --> 18:36.440]  threatening go read it for yourself and then here's the other news on that front
[18:36.440 --> 18:41.640]  so on why America must answer for the Charleston church massacre see it's a
[18:41.640 --> 18:46.160]  collective guilt that's a telltale sign of an authoritarian regime when your
[18:46.160 --> 18:50.840]  neighbor does something wrong so you get punished to or or a fascist regime or
[18:50.840 --> 18:54.800]  communist regime anything to tell Terian the Nazis in occupied Poland and
[18:54.800 --> 19:02.040]  Ukraine and Russia if a soldier got shot by a sniper in the town they would
[19:02.040 --> 19:07.560]  kill 10 people randomly if an SS officer got killed they'd kill 100 or a
[19:07.560 --> 19:15.200]  thousand and that's how this works oh someone else did something bad with a
[19:15.200 --> 19:19.280]  gun you're to blame then they get on the news and Obama goes there's an
[19:19.280 --> 19:23.680]  epidemic it's getting worse nobody else has these problems crime using guns is

[22:43.680 --> 22:48.000]  shopping for a new wallet mine is falling apart hey did you know there's a
[22:48.000 --> 22:51.920]  company called ID stronghold that makes shielded wallets to prevent electronic
[22:51.920 --> 22:55.240]  pickpocketing oh I didn't realize there was such a thing as electronic pick
[22:55.240 --> 22:59.400]  pocketing what is that well apparently many of the new credit and debit cards
[22:59.400 --> 23:04.160]  being issued have radio chips inside them called RFID the transmitter banking
[23:04.160 --> 23:08.600]  information to card readers when we pay unfortunately a bad guy can also get one
[23:08.600 --> 23:12.040]  of these readers and go around the city scanning people collecting their credit
[23:12.040 --> 23:16.240]  card numbers and personal information without us knowing it wow that sounds
[23:16.240 --> 23:20.120]  scary since you're getting a new wallet anyway you should definitely get an ID
[23:20.120 --> 23:24.280]  stronghold shielded wallet are they more expensive no in fact I can get a
[23:24.280 --> 23:28.000]  shielded leather wallet from ID stronghold dot com for the same price or
[23:28.000 --> 23:32.640]  less than regular unshielded wallets from other stores sounds great my wallet
[23:32.640 --> 23:36.040]  isn't falling apart yet but let me pick one out to I want to be protected and
[23:36.040 --> 24:01.320]  these wallets ID stronghold dot com look fantastic
[24:01.320 --> 24:04.960]  stop getting weird thanks for joining us on this Friday edition all shuns here
[24:04.960 --> 24:10.320]  live I'll be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. Central you're watching us on TV I
[24:10.320 --> 24:18.040]  have two HD firearms two head down firearms both 5 5 6 in front of me to
[24:18.040 --> 24:22.520]  just illustrate these guns aren't going to shoot anybody these rifles these
[24:22.520 --> 24:26.640]  weapons aren't going to attack anybody by themselves and I know that's an
[24:26.640 --> 24:32.680]  idiotically obvious thing to say but look at the logic of the people demonizing
[24:32.680 --> 24:38.960]  gun owners they're now saying gun ownership is racist no disarming black
[24:38.960 --> 24:44.560]  people in the south at the end of the civil war that was racist the first
[24:44.560 --> 24:50.760]  gun laws were racist saying the NRA was a racist organization is again upside
[24:50.760 --> 24:57.600]  down it's a total fraud I'm not even going to get into the NRA's history but
[24:57.600 --> 25:02.840]  everybody who's informed knows it was founded to arm blacks to fight the
[25:02.840 --> 25:08.480]  Ku Klux Klan again and the party the Ku Klux Klan the Democrats won our guns
[25:08.480 --> 25:14.680]  and I'm not saying the Republicans are much better the Republican Tea Party is
[25:14.680 --> 25:19.040]  great that's why 50 million dollars has been given the last year by the
[25:19.040 --> 25:25.000]  Republican leadership and their donors to destroy the Tea Party teaming up with
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.600]  the Democrats in closed-door meetings because the Tea Party doesn't want the
[25:28.600 --> 25:31.680]  TPP Tea Party didn't want to turn over the guns Tea Party didn't want to make
[25:31.680 --> 25:38.320]  the president a dictator who serves foreign interest but we have to get that
[25:38.320 --> 25:43.840]  logic out to people and point out hey actual crime with guns is way down most
[25:43.840 --> 25:49.360]  black people are killed by their black people and the media doesn't personalize
[25:49.360 --> 25:53.680]  other deaths they've chosen to personalize this because Juneteenth's
[25:53.680 --> 25:59.680]  coming up because the NAACP conventions coming up and it's going to be all
[25:59.680 --> 26:05.240]  about galvanizing the black community to demand gun restrictions in America to
[26:05.240 --> 26:12.440]  give Obama cover like he did with his executive actions on Amnesty hey
[26:12.440 --> 26:18.120]  Congress wouldn't pass it I changed the law we have an intro that has those
[26:18.120 --> 26:22.440]  quotes maybe we should play it next segment he said I changed the law with
[26:22.440 --> 26:26.760]  actions I just took and he says I'm getting ready with gun control just
[26:26.760 --> 26:31.080]  give me time I've got more than 18 executive actions I'm getting ready to
[26:31.080 --> 26:38.000]  take so they just tried to ban semi-autos they just tried to shut down
[26:38.000 --> 26:43.080]  gun shows they just tried all this they're coming don't think just because
[26:43.080 --> 26:49.720]  we've had a couple victories against the gun grabbers that the war has been won I
[26:49.720 --> 26:53.640]  told you last Friday when we shot down the TPP they're gonna be back next
[26:53.640 --> 26:58.640]  Thursday and I was so busy trying to explain what was happened in the second
[26:58.640 --> 27:05.280]  amendment with his tragic shooting with this dirtbag or he may be a victim
[27:05.280 --> 27:09.560]  though now I see him he looks totally arrogant and whacked out but drugs can
[27:09.560 --> 27:12.680]  do that people as well they can charge him up
[27:12.680 --> 27:20.040]  charlton pastor fears riots after church shooting but then when Matt drudge
[27:20.040 --> 27:24.080]  talks about how race wars being pushed the media comes out and demonizes him
[27:24.080 --> 27:29.360]  saying that he's pushing race war that article is up on info wars.com
[27:29.360 --> 27:35.840]  progressive tweets drudge trying to start race war no we and drudge anyone
[27:35.840 --> 27:40.800]  sensible is exposing the push to create racial division and to rub salt in the
[27:40.800 --> 27:45.040]  wounds and to start a war against the police to destabilize local communities
[27:45.040 --> 27:49.200]  so they could come in and federalize things in how sharpens own words we are
[27:49.200 --> 27:54.520]  the restorationist we're trying to stop a globalist takeover we don't want
[27:54.520 --> 28:00.640]  destabilization we don't get power out of that we want freedom and Joe Jennings
[28:00.640 --> 28:05.360]  wanted to talk about this again it turns out charlton shooter was on a drug
[28:05.360 --> 28:10.520]  linked to violent outburst it's up on info wars.com and you told me be
[28:10.520 --> 28:14.800]  before all this happened what happened to your dad once they prescribed him this
[28:14.800 --> 28:22.280]  tell folks what it did to your father basically you can't blame weapons as the
[28:22.280 --> 28:29.320]  cause of this the biggest weapon is these prescription drugs what they do is
[28:29.320 --> 28:36.440]  they turn somebody who's completely normal into another person just
[28:36.440 --> 28:43.880]  completely into a zombie that's suggestive is just sitting there not
[28:43.880 --> 28:49.400]  knowing what world they're in so if you put a weapon in the hand of that person
[28:49.400 --> 28:53.120]  the little voices inside their head because of these prescription drugs
[28:53.120 --> 29:01.560]  like Suboxone Zoloft it's the cocktail mixture that just completely eradicates
[29:01.560 --> 29:04.400]  the people come back and tell us because you wanted to share what happened to
[29:04.400 --> 29:08.320]  your father you were saying completely normal happy healthy he goes on Suboxone
[29:08.320 --> 29:12.960]  just I mean my dad's a dentist he's retired but they give people similar
[29:12.960 --> 29:16.640]  drugs in sedation dentistry you could tell them stick your hand in the light
[29:16.640 --> 29:20.800]  socket you can tell them jump off a cliff they'll do it and I said yesterday
[29:20.800 --> 29:27.480]  if he's on an amnesic look out folks this may be staged look at the graphic on
[29:27.480 --> 29:32.280]  info wars.com mass murder pills that's what they are we're on the march the
[29:32.280 --> 29:39.400]  empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:40.840 --> 29:47.400]  Obama's gun control will kill more blacks president Barack Obama called for
[29:47.400 --> 29:51.920]  strict gun control in response to the Charleston South Carolina church
[29:51.920 --> 29:56.800]  shooting but that'll mean more deaths of African Americans the president blames
[29:56.800 --> 30:01.080]  guns for the shooting which claim nine lives at the historically black
[30:01.080 --> 30:06.120]  Emmanuel a.m. each church on Wednesday however the frequent violence which
[30:06.120 --> 30:11.960]  occurs in areas with strict gun laws totally debunks Obama's claim that gun
[30:11.960 --> 30:18.600]  control works simply put more guns lead to less crime overall guns are used 80
[30:18.600 --> 30:23.320]  times more often to stop crime than they're used to kill people would you

[32:48.320 --> 32:54.720]  you can vote all week. The Rio Arriba County clerk's office reported this afternoon that a
[32:54.720 --> 32:59.320]  voter trying to cast an early ballot in Espanola today was told he had already
[32:59.320 --> 33:03.360]  voted three days prior. Activist on the tape goes on to suggest that discarded
[33:03.360 --> 33:07.320]  ballots could be collected from what she called ghetto aurora saying that
[33:07.320 --> 33:11.360]  African-Americans and Mexicans tend to throw out their ballots. And as for those
[33:11.360 --> 33:15.320]  programs we do need I'll make them work better and I'll make them cost less.
[33:15.320 --> 33:19.320]  Thousands of federal workers are issued tax payer-funded credit cards so long as
[33:19.320 --> 33:24.440]  they buy items that cost less than $3,000 or micro purchases. Our review
[33:24.440 --> 33:30.120]  found about $20 billion in just about the course of the year. We'll save billions
[33:30.120 --> 33:34.220]  by cutting waste and improving management and strengthening oversight. We
[33:34.220 --> 33:38.220]  asked all of these other major federal agencies based here in DC for their
[33:38.220 --> 33:44.040]  micro purchase shopping lists and all refused. I'm pledging to cut the deficit
[33:44.040 --> 33:48.640]  we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office. The independent
[33:48.640 --> 33:53.360]  congressional budget office warning a new fiscal crisis is coming if Washington
[33:53.360 --> 33:56.480]  doesn't get it spending and check. Raising the debt ceiling which has done
[33:56.480 --> 34:01.120]  been done over a hundred times does not increase our debt. If you've got a
[34:01.120 --> 34:06.120]  business that you didn't build that somebody else made that happen.
[34:20.120 --> 34:28.120]  Live from the Infowars.com studios. First Ebola is not spread through the air like the fluke.
[34:28.120 --> 34:37.120]  Ebola is capable of entering human airway cells. Ebola is primed to be able to
[34:37.120 --> 34:42.120]  have respiratory transmission. Crashing through the lies and disinformation

[35:17.120 --> 35:22.120]  and he's going to be joining us in the next hour. We'll cover the waterfront
[35:22.120 --> 35:25.120]  with the former Minnesota governor who they've really tried to destroy and
[35:25.120 --> 35:30.120]  demonize and done a partial job of it saying he got arrested
[35:30.120 --> 35:40.120]  because he was in Minnesota and went on TV.
[35:40.120 --> 35:45.120]  Then they said Chris Kyle beat him up because he was running around saying
[35:45.120 --> 35:52.120]  I'm glad Navy SEALs are dead when he'd been there speaking at their commencement.
[35:52.120 --> 35:58.120]  Then he sued and won. The breaking news. This is not in the news yet.
[35:58.120 --> 36:05.120]  Concerning the media and free speech what's happened is unprecedented.
[36:05.120 --> 36:09.120]  He will be joining us in the next hour. It affects the media.
[36:09.120 --> 36:14.120]  It ties into the internet kill switch. It ties into web censorship.
[36:14.120 --> 36:20.120]  It ties into SOPA, SISPA, defamation, everything. It is incredible.
[36:20.120 --> 36:29.120]  As soon as he called me at about four o'clock yesterday I was out doing business errands
[36:29.120 --> 36:36.120]  and I pulled over, did a search and he was correct. It was not in the news.
[36:36.120 --> 36:41.120]  I was back and forth with Ventura and his lawyer. He was on the other line with his lawyer
[36:41.120 --> 36:46.120]  on another phone back and forth just deciding on whether or not he can go public with this
[36:46.120 --> 36:51.120]  and that decision has been made on this broadcast. I should have announced this right at the start.
[36:51.120 --> 36:59.120]  In fact, we need to tweet that Jesse Ventura will be joining us with exclusive news
[36:59.120 --> 37:07.120]  concerning a massive attack on the First Amendment or that we're going to be breaking
[37:07.120 --> 37:13.120]  very important story concerning the future of free speech in this country.
[37:13.120 --> 37:22.120]  Basically, in fact, it's so big, I don't even have words to describe what to send out on Twitter.
[37:22.120 --> 37:38.120]  The media are petitioning the court to codify in federal law that you are allowed to lie
[37:38.120 --> 37:49.120]  and that you cannot be found liable but only if you're establishment media.
[37:49.120 --> 37:59.120]  And he has the amicus brief that has been put into the court case on the appeal
[37:59.120 --> 38:10.120]  by 50 top media outlets to overturn his case. That's all I'm going to say right there, but this is a big deal.
[38:10.120 --> 38:17.120]  A jury found that he was defamed. They called in the witnesses.
[38:17.120 --> 38:23.120]  They all said different things. It wasn't true. Kyle changed his story.
[38:23.120 --> 38:32.120]  The insurance company now just the books made over 70 million. The movie 200 something million.
[38:32.120 --> 38:37.120]  Ventura just got a million and a half. It cost him a million dollars to sue.
[38:37.120 --> 38:43.120]  You know, I'm supposed to say that. The point is, it was all about his name. Ventura's got plenty of money.
[38:43.120 --> 38:47.120]  He did land deals, you name it, media things. I mean, the guy's loaded.
[38:47.120 --> 38:54.120]  And he did this because it's not true. And he talked to Kyle personally before he died and said, stop lying.
[38:54.120 --> 38:59.120]  I've never met you. He's been in the room with him. Stop it.
[38:59.120 --> 39:07.120]  And Kyle would not do it. So they killed him and had a PTSD vet to fit the whole narrative so they could have their movie
[39:07.120 --> 39:15.120]  and have their hero when the book has been proven not just the Ventura part to be a load of horse crap.
[39:15.120 --> 39:23.120]  And as much as I like Texans, as much as I like rodeo riders, as much as I like tough guys from Texas,
[39:23.120 --> 39:30.120]  I mean, this is a story made for people like me. I got family a lot like Chris Kyle, the real deal.
[39:30.120 --> 39:35.120]  And Chris Kyle was brave, did do a lot of stuff, but a bunch of his book was hyped up just like Private Lynch,
[39:35.120 --> 39:39.120]  just like Pat Tillman wouldn't go along with it. They killed him.
[39:39.120 --> 39:48.120]  They killed four members of her team to shut them up, but then it still came out. It was all fake.
[39:48.120 --> 39:54.120]  In fact, you can see my whole American sniper exposes giant hoax. That's coming up.
[39:54.120 --> 39:58.120]  And this ties in to everything.
[39:58.120 --> 40:07.120]  But now it's about free speech and a huge case. So Jesse Ventura will be joining us on that front more.
[40:07.120 --> 40:21.120]  But while we're busy talking about the nine people that are dead, why aren't we talking about the hundreds?
[40:21.120 --> 40:28.120]  I was looking at the numbers. It's something like 300 plus blacks get shot by other blacks a year and killed.
[40:28.120 --> 40:35.120]  Thousands get shot in Chicago in the city proper, not counting all the suburbs.
[40:35.120 --> 40:43.120]  There's no speeches. There's no discussion. There's no talk about trying to stop that or the 14 million dead black babies
[40:43.120 --> 40:49.120]  that have been aborted since Roe v. Wade. Some numbers are even higher.
[40:49.120 --> 40:55.120]  It's all just these nine people as if it's the end of the world because the media tells us when to get upset,
[40:55.120 --> 41:00.120]  when to get angry. Here are the headlines and we're going back to Joe Jennings.
[41:00.120 --> 41:08.120]  Charlton Shooter was on drug link to violent outburst. Surprise, surprise, as Gomer Pyle likes to say.
[41:08.120 --> 41:16.120]  House approves fast track 218 to 208, sending bill to the Senate, devastating.
[41:16.120 --> 41:24.120]  But Salon says white America must answer for the Charlton Church massacre. That's right. You're all collectively bad.
[41:24.120 --> 41:30.120]  So I guess when a black person does something wrong, all black people are collectively bad or Hitler was bad.
[41:30.120 --> 41:35.120]  So now all Germans or Austrians today are guilty. No, they're not.
[41:35.120 --> 41:40.120]  In fact, a two year old Austrian baby is guilty for Hitler. No, he's not.
[41:40.120 --> 41:50.120]  I'm not guilty. I've done nothing but try to help people. I don't have any guilt. I'm sick of it.
[41:50.120 --> 41:57.120]  I was raised around just intense culture of white guilt that just permeates Christians.
[41:57.120 --> 42:05.120]  My family are Christians across the board and I'm sick of it. I haven't done jack crap to anybody.
[42:05.120 --> 42:15.120]  In fact, I bet you money. There are few living black people that have been abused by white people as much as I have been abused by black people.
[42:15.120 --> 42:20.120]  And again, I was attacked by redneck gangs, some fights with Mexican gangs.
[42:20.120 --> 42:25.120]  I didn't realize it was gangs at the time, but people, they didn't know they were in gangs. It's just gang behavior.
[42:25.120 --> 42:28.120]  It's mob psychology. That's what a race war is.
[42:28.120 --> 42:39.120]  But I grew up in Dallas, Texas and was probably in 200 fights, maybe 50 of them seriously deadly by the time I was 16 and they were real fights.
[42:39.120 --> 42:45.120]  But I was beat up. I was thinking about the other day, did I exaggerate saying 200? No.
[42:45.120 --> 42:52.120]  I probably got attacked from sixth grade to eighth grade until I really started hurting people and I fought back.
[42:52.120 --> 42:58.120]  Then people started backing off by kids that had flunked three grades. It didn't matter if they were rednecks or blacks.
[42:58.120 --> 43:05.120]  It wasn't so much the Mexicans doing it. Though I got some run-ins with them, I was constantly fighting blacks and rednecks.
[43:05.120 --> 43:13.120]  They acted just the same. They'd be like five rednecks or five blacks. They'd shoot their mouth off, trip you, run your head in the wall.
[43:13.120 --> 43:18.120]  You start fighting one, beat one up. They all jump on you. I'm just tired of it.
[43:18.120 --> 43:26.120]  But I don't sit here hating black people because I've had black people attacking me saying, I'm going to beat your brains out, cracker.
[43:26.120 --> 43:32.120]  They were racist. They were bad. It's the same violent black people that are preying on black people.
[43:32.120 --> 43:39.120]  But I just, how many black people out there have been and probably have had white people physically attack them?
[43:39.120 --> 43:47.120]  I don't want to exaggerate. I say 200, 300, total fights, 100, maybe 50 were really hardcore.
[43:47.120 --> 43:53.120]  I've been in the hospital probably 15 times fighting. The hospital. Broken bones.
[43:53.120 --> 44:00.120]  I mean, I've been on the ambulance when the person's traked next to me or when their brain's hanging out.
[44:00.120 --> 44:08.120]  And I got blood coming out of my eyes and can't see. I mean, I've been in savage Conan the Barbarian fights growing up in Dallas, Texas, ladies and gentlemen.
[44:08.120 --> 44:13.120]  And it was almost always racial or territorial.
[44:13.120 --> 44:20.120]  I bet I've been beat up when I was little by black gangs 50 times.
[44:20.120 --> 44:29.120]  And I've probably been in fights where I was older and fought back probably 35, 40 times with black people.
[44:29.120 --> 44:33.120]  I mean, just savage fights. We're trying to kill each other.
[44:33.120 --> 44:40.120]  No holds barred. Bang in heads in concrete. Because if you don't bang their heads, they're going to bang your head.
[44:40.120 --> 44:47.120]  I mean, where am I whining and complaining? I'm not. I'm just sick of hearing about it. I'm tired of it.
[44:47.120 --> 44:55.120]  And then you put watched out people, black or white or whatever, on drugs that make people kill people or highly suggestible.
[44:55.120 --> 45:02.120]  And then you say white people are to blame. When as a white person, I am eight times more likely to be attacked by a black person.
[45:02.120 --> 45:06.120]  And I'll say it again. I don't blame the general black public. They're scared of these thugs.
[45:06.120 --> 45:14.120]  I can't go to the nicer restaurants. They've got a whole bunch of them in East Austin that they've built in the last 10 years.
[45:14.120 --> 45:20.120]  Because they got black thugs going around trying to shake people down and mug folks.
[45:20.120 --> 45:25.120]  The last three times now, I've been down there past seven o'clock at night.
[45:25.120 --> 45:33.120]  I have been approached by a black guy's over six feet, 250 pounds going, I need some money. I need it right now.
[45:33.120 --> 45:36.120]  You're like, I'm not going to give you money. And they start bowing up when I need it right now.
[45:36.120 --> 45:41.120]  They don't say give it to me or I'm going to attack you. They just, I'm going to give it. I need the money right now.
[45:41.120 --> 45:49.120]  Like, you know, that's a nice watch. Same thing happens in New York. It's happened to Rob Jacobson a bunch on the train growing up and going to work almost always.
[45:49.120 --> 45:58.120]  Black guys, because there's this attitude that they are allowed to do it because you're white because you deserve it.
[45:58.120 --> 46:04.120]  Now, I'm not a racist, so I don't blame black people in general because most black people aren't like that.
[46:04.120 --> 46:11.120]  They get fed on by these same thugs as well. But there is a thug culture that's accepted in this country and there's whites doing it as well.
[46:11.120 --> 46:20.120]  I told you, rednecks in bad areas, East Texas and Dallas act just like black gangs. They are so much alike and they hate each other, of course.
[46:20.120 --> 46:28.120]  They hate everybody. And I'm kind of ranting here. It's just, that's what I'm getting at.
[46:28.120 --> 46:35.120]  Now, I wanted to go back to Joe Jennings. If you just joined us, he's one of our great producers back there and runs the audio board.
[46:35.120 --> 46:46.120]  He was talking about his dad who recently died and he was on the same drug that the reported shooter, The Dirtbag, Dylan Storm Roof was on.
[46:46.120 --> 46:55.120]  And usually with a middle name like Storm, that's either a family name or it's a white supremacist handle.
[46:55.120 --> 47:05.120]  He's obviously wound up by somebody. I said, yesterday, he's probably on an amnesiac and he wanted to start a race war. Now that's admitted.
[47:05.120 --> 47:07.120]  Let's go ahead and get your take on this drug, Joe Jennings.
[47:07.120 --> 47:11.120]  Hey, Alex, guess what? A prescription drug doesn't care about.
[47:11.120 --> 47:12.120]  What?
[47:12.120 --> 47:13.120]  What race you are.
[47:13.120 --> 47:14.120]  That's right.
[47:14.120 --> 47:22.120]  It doesn't care. It just turns you into whatever it wants you to. If people want to be mad, you need to be mad at Big Pharma.
[47:22.120 --> 47:34.120]  You need to be mad at these doctors that are prescribing this crap, this mind-altering junk to fill a void in these people that there's nothing wrong with.
[47:34.120 --> 47:43.120]  It's an incredible epidemic. First, it started with he was addicted to Vicodin, which was given to him from doctors like it was candy.
[47:43.120 --> 47:55.120]  Go here, take this. Vicodin, here, take it. So he had to get on Suboxone, which is very similar to a methadone.
[47:55.120 --> 48:03.120]  Sure. They invented heroin at the end of the Civil War to get the troops off opium. It's about eight times stronger. So they get you off one narcotic with another.
[48:03.120 --> 48:13.120]  Oh, yeah. And it's a schedule too. He had a heck of a time getting any doctor, and he had to go to different states to get a doctor to prescribe it for him.
[48:13.120 --> 48:21.120]  None of them want to touch it. But now, oh, take this. This is this new drug, Suboxone. It's good for you. Take it.
[48:21.120 --> 48:38.120]  What I don't understand, and none of my family understand, is how can a healthy person who's, you know, he was seven years old, die in three months from brain cancer that is not genetically in our family, not from anything.
[48:38.120 --> 48:51.120]  He was on Suboxone for quite a while, and other antidepressants and other things. It's a mixture. It's a cocktail of all these different prescription drugs that they give you. Take this to counteract this.
[48:51.120 --> 48:55.120]  But Suboxone was the worst out of all of them.
[48:55.120 --> 49:00.120]  And now they admit drug overdoses are exploding from prescription drugs across the United States.
[49:00.120 --> 49:10.120]  Oh, yeah. My mom told me one time, because Suboxone was sublingual, so it's like the listerine strip. She just put it on your tongue, and it goes straight into your bloodstream.
[49:10.120 --> 49:20.120]  She said she gave my dad a kiss, and he forgot to tell her that he just took it. That drug knocked my mom out for four hours. She couldn't move.
[49:20.120 --> 49:26.120]  Now, these people take it daily. What do you think it's doing to them?
[49:26.120 --> 49:28.120]  And she just got a fraction of it.
[49:28.120 --> 49:32.120]  Yeah, just a little.
[49:32.120 --> 49:39.120]  Can you imagine what somebody with any weapon is going to do when they're on that drug?
[49:39.120 --> 49:54.120]  It's not them. It's not the person that they really are. It's being masked. It's being controlled. It's obliterating anything that they are.
[49:54.120 --> 49:57.120]  But it's okay. It's good for you.
[49:57.120 --> 50:06.120]  And the very same government that is controlled by the big pharma itself on by big mega banks are shipping in the major narcotics.
[50:06.120 --> 50:11.120]  And then it destroys our society just like the drug wars destroyed Mexico. It's not that we're for these drugs.
[50:11.120 --> 50:15.120]  The drug pushers made the drugs illegal to make larger profits off of it.
[50:15.120 --> 50:19.120]  Well, I'm sorry about your father, but your warning certainly will help others. Thank you so much, Joe Jennings.
[50:19.120 --> 50:23.120]  Thanks, Alex.
[50:23.120 --> 50:30.120]  We have Jesse Ventura joining us. I had Reverend Childress on of blackgenocide.org. His insight was so powerful.
[50:30.120 --> 50:37.120]  I'm inviting him back on the third hour today, blackgenocide.org. He's coming up today and we'll open the phones up.
[50:37.120 --> 50:41.120]  I apologize for not getting to those calls yesterday. I really do.
[50:41.120 --> 50:49.120]  So the phone rings and I pick it up and it's Mark. And Mark says to me, hey, third Sunday, June, Father's Day, I ordered dad a gun.
[50:49.120 --> 50:53.120]  It's here. He's going to build it out and we're going to go out on Father's Day shooting. You want to come?
[50:53.120 --> 50:59.120]  And I said, yeah, what a great idea for Father's Day gift. An AR-15 rifle kit from guns80.com.
[50:59.120 --> 51:03.120]  I think I'll get my dad one. He says, go ahead, see you out in the rain. So we're going to meet on the range on Father's Day.
[51:03.120 --> 51:11.120]  Get your dad an AR-15 rifle kit at guns80.com, guns80.com, or call 844-2-Guns80.

[53:42.120 --> 54:01.120]  Almost every day, I see a story that's a Rosetta Stone. I talk a lot about that. A decoding article that takes you deep into what's happening.
[54:01.120 --> 54:08.120]  Later in the broadcast, I will get into this Bloomberg article that's linked up on infowars.com that is so important.
[54:08.120 --> 54:18.120]  They try to make a joke out of it in Bloomberg. There's a pile of gold in Manhattan. Texas wants it back.
[54:18.120 --> 54:30.120]  Texas is to repatriate a billion dollars of gold bullion, 5,600 bars of precious metal. They go on to say Texas is stable and we're doing this to show that we can...
[54:30.120 --> 54:44.120]  I mean, go read it. Basically stabilize the state during a collapse. The Russians and Chinese want their gold back out of the, quote, Federal Reserve vaults, the private Federal Reserve vaults.
[54:44.120 --> 54:52.120]  And they make it a Texas versus the North thing. Texas wants its gold back from the Yankees wherever they're keeping it.
[54:52.120 --> 55:04.120]  Governor Greg Abbott signed a law last week to build a depository for 5,600 bars of the precious metal. As he said in a statement, repatriate one billion of gold from the Federal Reserve in New York.
[55:04.120 --> 55:21.120]  See, Abbott knows the Federal Reserve's private. He's a patriot. He's anti-New World Order. They hate him. We've never had a governor like this, not in the whole history of Texas because they didn't need to be anti-New World Order before there wasn't a total takeover.
[55:21.120 --> 55:36.120]  I mean, this is a big deal. They really hate the governor. He needs serious security. I know he does have it, but they know he's for real, folks, and they know he knows what's going on.
[55:36.120 --> 55:51.120]  You know, I got one of his billionaire associates in here the other day and he was on air and he wouldn't go all the way talking about the governor and the stuff, but I know other sources with the governor as well.
[55:51.120 --> 56:02.120]  I met the governor before and I also run into his chief of staff quite a bit, but none of that's an issue. The point is he knows what's going on and a lot of Texas lawmakers know what's going on.
[56:02.120 --> 56:12.120]  And they don't want to sell the country out. They know the plan is to collapse the country into a depression. They want prosperity. They want freedom. They want Americana. They're not bad people.
[56:12.120 --> 56:22.120]  And it's getting clearer and clearer that this is happening, but they spend it like Texas doesn't like New York. That goal doesn't help New York City.
[56:22.120 --> 56:33.120]  It's in the private Federal Reserve bank vaults. The Federal Reserve is over 60% foreign owned. It's not federal. I know I keep saying that, but just everything they do is a lie.
[56:33.120 --> 56:46.120]  And here's the word. More and more gold that's been expatriated out of New York vaults turns out to be gold plated tungsten that weighs the same as gold. It's atomic weight.
[56:46.120 --> 56:59.120]  So there's a major scandal here. And that's exactly what our different guests have been talking about how they're trying to ban physical gold in the EU and stuff starting in Spain, because the world is getting ready to melt down.
[56:59.120 --> 57:12.120]  We've never been closer. Ron Paul's and CNBC today. Let me give you the exact quote. I've got it here. Just saying that we're on the edge. I can't find it. I read the actual quote earlier.
[57:12.120 --> 57:25.120]  It's on screen. Ron Paul stock market day of reckoning is near. You bet it is. We're on top of big fat house of cards and the globalists are scurrying around robbing what they can here in the end game.
[57:25.120 --> 57:31.120]  I mean, this is a crazy time. This is what we're going to find out if the good guys aren't the bad guys are separately. It's more important than ever.

[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:18.120]  Huge news dealing with the first amendment really unprecedented coming up in the next segment with former Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:29.120]  We'll get his take on the situation in South Carolina, the tragic shootings. This nine dad that took place Wednesday night and the aftermath of that.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:42.120]  We'll look at the situation in the Middle East. We'll look at French invent robots to replace border police. There's again another massive move to open up the borders right now.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:50.120]  It's already been done with executive action when they're trying to ram that through Congress. I got really happy about this, but I said the fight was coming up again next week.
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:01:03.120]  While we were busy diverted by the tragic events in South Carolina, America came inches closer because we're only a few inches away from being conquered by the TPP.
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:13.120]  I mean, this is a total takeover of everything in our country, basically by foreign shadowy grips and a secret treaty. It is just so awesome in a bad way.
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:21.120]  What they're getting away with House approves fast track 218 to 208.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:31.120]  I saw that in the afternoon yesterday and I was like a in the pit of my stomach. I just felt nauseated. I had Larry Nichols on former top Clinton insider.
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:47.120]  I wasn't feeling so much defeated just sad that we're so conquered and it's getting so much worse and the rapacious predatory vicious hatred of prosperity and freedom that the criminal class has this in control.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:02:04.120]  And just to know that, man, we either route these people and push them back and prosecute them and bring them to justice or it's just all going to collapse and we've reached that point. We can't go much further because the bottom is dropping out.
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:17.120]  The House on Thursday took the first step towards resurrecting the White House trade agenda. It's not trades takeover, but see the lapdog media goes along with that by passing legislation granting President Obama fast track authority.
[01:02:17.120 --> 01:02:25.120]  The bill now gives the Senate goes to the Senate where the White House and GOP leaders are seeking to strike a deal with pro trade Democrats. It's not trade.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:36.120]  The whole article threatened to deceive the House vote 218 to 208 with 28 Democrats voting for it. This is the second time in a week the House has voted to approve the controversial fast track bill.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:44.120]  And when you fail, just do it again. On Friday, the House voted 219 to 211 in favor of fast track.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:03:01.120]  Which will make it easier for Obama to complete the sweeping trans-Pacific trade deal. In last week's vote, the GOP parried with fast track bill with the measure known as trade adjustment assistance, TAA, that gives aid to workers as placed by trade.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:08.120]  Oh, here's some money for retraining, but you're going to lose your job forever. Here's your last meal.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:21.120]  Both measures needed to be approved in the separate votes for the entire package to move forward. House Democrats have historically favored TAA, but they voted against it Friday to kill fast track, which is deeply opposed by unions and other liberal groups.
[01:03:21.120 --> 01:03:32.120]  Yeah, unions have already sold themselves out to NAFTA and GATT and other things, and they're pretty much compromised and controlled and, you know, support gun control and open borders and all sorts of suicidal behavior.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:43.120]  But now at the end, they get a secret bill we can't read and three sections of it that if leaks say that foreign groups will dictate everything, no, we've got to reverse this.
[01:03:43.120 --> 01:03:52.120]  And that's now basically what's happened. Again, if you're a TV viewer or a radio listener, you can go to infowars.com forward slash show and be a TV viewer. It's free.
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:04:05.120]  You can see I've got two HD firearms.com super high quality, but also affordable 556 rifles. We just have these out here today because the new attack on guns is here.
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:17.120]  Let it be known that the next shoot a drop is now dropping the trial balloons are done. The new assault with legislation and executive orders to restrict the Second Amendment is on.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:28.120]  And we'll talk to Foreign Minister of Governor Jesse Ventura about that about openly funding Al Qaeda about the the buildup for war with Russia about a huge massive attack on the First Amendment.
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:42.120]  That's why he's really joining us and so much more election 2016 the shootings happening around the country. It's all coming up with Jesse Ventura.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:54.120]  ISIS blatantly supported by John McCain and the Pentagon and hesitantly supplied tanks, rocket launchers, missile and anti aircraft systems in accidental air drops.
[01:04:54.120 --> 01:05:05.120]  Just sending arms very frankly, although they need them very badly, they need anti tank and anti air weapons are is not going to change the situation on the ground and the massacre goes on.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:15.120]  Now it has been confirmed that ISIS has stockpiled enough radioactive material to create weapons of mass destruction in the ISIS magazine, the beak.
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:27.120]  ISIS declared their intent to acquire a nuclear warhead from Pakistan with their billions of stolen funds gobbled up as they ransacked banks and took control of oil fields across Iraq and Syria.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:37.120]  ISIS claims that all they have to do is call on their leaders in Pakistan to purchase a nuclear device through weapons dealers with links to corrupt officials in the region.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:06:01.120]  Your liver can be full of fatty deposits built up toxins and even dangerous objects known as liver stones.

[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:58.120]  For more than a decade, my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[01:06:58.120 --> 01:07:10.120]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend. Discover and try a bag of the Patriot blend 100% organic coffee at infowarslife.com.

[01:07:38.120 --> 01:07:55.120]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[01:07:55.120 --> 01:08:04.120]  That's right when I first had that intro, I don't know 18 years ago, is when that intro was recorded.
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:08.120]  It was a little bit cheeky, a little bit of a joke, a little bit snarky.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:15.120]  But now I am in FEMA Region 6, formerly Texas. We are under global government. The TPP has passed the House, set to pass the Senate.
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:24.120]  Liberal conservatives across the board from the unions to the Tea Party that have gotten the subsections through WikiLeaks say it's the end of sovereignty as we know it.
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:31.120]  It makes the President a dictator. It gives him unlimited power over trade, borders, taxes, guns, you name it.
[01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:35.120]  And it says in there they'll do this.
[01:08:35.120 --> 01:08:43.120]  So while we were all focused on the tragic shooting in South Carolina and Charleston, this was ran through yesterday.
[01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:54.120]  And while we were busy doing that, they were putting in internet kill switches and the FCC was declaring power over the web and saying they're planning to tax it and regulate it and control free speech.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:09:05.120]  There is a move towards totalitarianism everywhere. The Prime Minister of England came out a month ago and said we're not going to put up with people's free speech anymore in a chilling statement.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:16.120]  Corruption in tyranny is accelerating because the globalists are taking over and they've committed so many crimes, it's all or nothing. They're going for broke.
[01:09:16.120 --> 01:09:27.120]  I've known Jesse Ventura for about eight, nine years and I've been part of three seasons or two seasons of his hit TV show. I've got to know him pretty well, traveled around the country with him, friends with his son as well.
[01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:43.120]  And he's the real deal. He's a real guy who doesn't compromise and even though I disagree with him probably on 10, 15% of his political views, I admire him because he sticks to his guns and he'll be the same today as he was a year ago as he'll be in five years.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:57.120]  He doesn't waffle and that's why he's demonized. It's why they ran the hit piece with late Chris Kyle, rest in peace, the family's now made and the overall book and film have made hundreds of millions of dollars.
[01:09:57.120 --> 01:10:08.120]  And the book was a fiction when it came to the Jesse Ventura part and a jury found that it was defamation, found that it was fraud.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:21.120]  That's very hard to do, especially when you're a public figure, but it was done with the intent of making money off to faming Ventura. It rose above that level.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:31.120]  There's now been a demonization campaign of Ventura, obviously because they don't want him running in 2016. They know a third party candidate could really galvanize the people. They're scared of that.
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:38.120]  And so they're assassinating him, just like they're assassinating Rand Paul and Ron Paul and others right now with demonization campaigns.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:50.120]  But he called me yesterday and we're honored he's breaking this news here. He's got one of the top lawyers in the country and who's beat Vince McMahon, you name it.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:11:01.120]  And he broke down some info that is so over the top and affects every American unprecedented. I'm going to let him tell you what's happened.
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:15.120]  But 50 top media outlets have all lined up with their money and their power to crush Jesse Ventura and everybody else's free speech and everybody else's right to a trial and defend themselves.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:29.120]  They want, simply put, the right from the courts to lie and destroy people. And remember MSNBC, my lawyer said I could win last year, but he said it would cost millions, millions I don't have.
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:39.120]  He said you can win. MSNBC said the bombers were influenced by Alex Jones and that Alex Jones is deeply racist and showed no proof.
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:53.120]  A jury would probably award me that. But I just want my name. But see, I can't file in every front. That's why I admired the fact that Ventura has spent incredible amounts of money, even though he was a well to do person.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:12:03.120]  He spent a lot of it is gone now to get his name back. I mean, I can't give you the numbers if he wants to do those he can, but I happen to know that he didn't make any money on this.
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:09.120]  But he did the right thing and now they're scared they're lined up and this affects everybody.
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:19.120]  Former Minnesota governor, TV star, movie star, bestselling author, former mayor, Jesse Ventura joins us back in the United States in Minnesota.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:25.120]  He also hosts off the grid TV on aura television, very popular.
[01:12:25.120 --> 01:12:34.120]  Governor, I tell you, when you broke this down to me yesterday, it was staggering. You've learned more today. This this is a big deal. Tell us exactly what's happened.
[01:12:34.120 --> 01:12:43.120]  Well, what's happened is this, Alex, I won the trial. It was in front of a jury. The jury found for me for defamation.
[01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:55.120]  Then they all there was a second count for unjust enrichment because of that defamation that they use the defamation to enrich themselves and make the millions of dollars.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:13:01.120]  And the jury awarded me a roughly 25% in unjust enrichment.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:08.120]  Well, this and we'll clarify right now. 50 is a little high. I'll read it. I've got it right in front of me.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:17.120]  This is a motion for leave to file brief. Whatever it is, A M I C I C U R I A E.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:33.120]  Now that's that's legal jargon of 33 media companies and organizations in support of the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals 8th Circuit District, urging a reversal of this decision.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:42.120]  Now, in layman's terms, what this means, they want the ability to be able to write lies about anybody.
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:51.120]  Now, it just happens. I'm a pretty big public figure. So they can but and so many people out there are going to think, well, this will never affect me.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:56.120]  I'm not a public figure like Jesse Ventura. No media is ever going to lie about me.
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:07.120]  So that may be true, but it's still this is a mega thing to our freedom and to protecting ourselves from the corporate fascist takeover that we're seeing.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:17.120]  And what they want, if this is overturned, they will then have the ability to lie about you and make profit from those lies.
[01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:23.120]  And you will have no way to redress or no way to be compensated for the damage they do to you.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:36.120]  So it's going to give them free reign. It's going to set the bar so high. The bar is already high, but it's going to set the bar so high that that they will be able to lie and get away with it.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:47.120]  And there'll be nothing any individual out there can do. I fought this fight now by myself. It's three and a half years now, Alex, and it's drained me financially.
[01:14:47.120 --> 01:14:56.120]  And my attorney said this could end up in the Supreme Court because we do have the Supreme Court decision back in 1960 backing us.
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:06.120]  So if the Circuit Court of Appeals rules for them, they will actually be going against a Supreme Court decision already on the books.
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:14.120]  So this could go all the way to the high court. I'm urging people. I've never did this before, really, Alex.
[01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:24.120]  Yes, I did when I ran for governor and mayor asking for votes. And this is hard for me to do being a person like I am, but I've got to ask for help on this.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:34.120]  I need help to fight this fight because it's a 33. I mean, it's a who's who, Alex. Let me go down the list.
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:39.120]  Absolutely. Last night we talked and you hadn't even seen the document yet. Just your lawyer said it was scores.
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:49.120]  Before we do that, Governor, let me just explain to folks to be clear here. The major media from the New York Times to Fox News who are signed on to this, you're going to go to the list.
[01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:59.120]  They are saying they want immunity to be able to lie just like vaccine makers want immunity. This is a license to steal, basically, people's identities.
[01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:09.120]  It's a license to say I'm a bomber or Alex Jones is a child molester or Joe Smith's a bank robber when we're not.
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:18.120]  And it makes it available that they can make profit from making those statements, that they will incur a great profit.
[01:16:18.120 --> 01:16:26.120]  And what they're trying to do is stop you from being able to stop them from making a profit from the lies.
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:31.120]  It's unprecedented. It is. Oh, yes, it is. This is unprecedented.
[01:16:31.120 --> 01:16:38.120]  This is big. So please break down what your top lawyer told you are the angles of this and who's signing on to.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:44.120]  Well, I got the list right here. You got any television networks. We all know them from cable.
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:56.120]  A&E, that Trans Publication Inc., American Society of News Editors, Association of Alternative News Media, the Association of American Publishers Inc.,
[01:16:56.120 --> 01:17:04.120]  the Authors Guild Inc., Buzzfeed Inc., the Center for Investigative Reporting Inc., Cox Media Group Inc.,
[01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:15.120]  EW Scripps Company, First Amendment Coalition, Forbes Media LLC, Janet Company Inc., Docker Media, Hatchet Book Group Inc.,
[01:17:15.120 --> 01:17:25.120]  the Hearst Corporation, Landmark Media Enterprises, the Media Law Resource Center, the Minnesota Newspaper Association.
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:33.120]  So even my own state of Minnesota stabs their governor in the back on this one. It shouldn't surprise me. They did it while I was governor too.
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:43.120]  Our Minnesota Newspaper Association, Motion Picture Association of America, MTA, the Association of Magazine Media,
[01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:51.120]  the National Association of Broadcasters, the National Press Photographers Association, National Public Radio Inc.,
[01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:59.120]  New York Media LLC, the New York Times, Newspaper Association of America, North Jersey Media Group Inc.,
[01:17:59.120 --> 01:18:05.120]  Penguin Random House LLC, the Reporters' Committee for Freedom of the Press and Time Incorporated,
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:12.120]  and Tribune Publishing Company LLC and the WP Company LLC, which is the Washington Post.
[01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:23.120]  They are so scared of you because you took on Goliath, you beat them, and now they're all piling in because they all tell so many lies now.
[01:18:23.120 --> 01:18:29.120]  Their executives have told them, go ahead and lie. They wouldn't lie as much as four or five years ago.
[01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:35.120]  I mean, they say outrageous lies about you and I and others constantly, and I guess they're scared.
[01:18:35.120 --> 01:18:42.120]  We're going to start suing them so they want the court to say they're allowed to enrich themselves off lying about people.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.120]  That is incredible.
[01:18:43.120 --> 01:18:55.120]  That's what they're asking the court to do because they're putting it in light that this is an alternative for punitive damages and, of course, you can't get punitive damage against an estate.
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:19:00.120]  I wonder if they'll... I'm surprised Brian Williams isn't a signatory to this.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:20.120]  Anyway, though, getting back to it, Alex, I never dreamed that this would explode to the level that it has. This is a who's who of the entire mainstream media of the United States of America.
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:29.120]  I know it is. Former Governor Jesse Ventura, who stood up, fought the hard fight, was told it's really going to be hard to win, still did it, because he was lied about. He was defamed.
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:41.120]  They said he was there happy that vets were dead when he'd been at their commencement, and he just stood up against it and he won, and he used the American system to do it, and they're trying to overthrow our system right now.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:19.120]  You know about RVs. You've heard about bunkers, but surviving is not recreation, and men wasn't made to live underground.

[01:21:44.120 --> 01:21:51.120]  It's true, some municipalities are now adding ammonia plus chlorine to your water supply. It's a disinfectant called chloramine.

[01:22:53.120 --> 01:23:04.120]  Almost every home security system, even those sold by big name companies, has a weakness. The phone line. You shell out 1500 bucks, get locked into a long-term contract and think you're safe.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:11.120]  But a burglar can destroy your alarm in seconds with one snip. And when a burglar cuts your phone line, you're defenseless.

[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:18.120]  Basically, that the New York Times is asking a federal court to certify that they're allowed to lie. The New York Times and others are going to court asking the government to protect them and let them lie.
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:32.120]  That's where this country's going. They want to be able to do this. The already defamation libel, if you're a public figure especially, is just stratosphericly hard to prove.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:40.120]  This is a short six-minute segment. Governor Ventura, I've never heard him really open it up during the breaks. I'm talking to him about this because he's brainstorming right now.
[01:24:40.120 --> 01:24:48.120]  He just had the idea for a defense fund today because he has expended most of his money, even though he was a bit done well. Three and a half years fighting these guys.
[01:24:48.120 --> 01:24:57.120]  He told me off air all they wanted to discovery. They're trying to break him right now. And if they do this, they're going to turn the heat up lying even more.
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:04.120]  This affects everybody, just like TPP, just like the gun grab. We hang together or we hang separate.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:10.120]  Governor, you were brainstorming a moment ago. Please share with the audience what you were sharing with me. I know it's hard for you to...
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:18.120]  You're not a proud man, but you're also a humble man, but you're a private man. But go ahead and share with people what you've been through.
[01:25:18.120 --> 01:25:34.120]  Well, you know, when I went through the trial with Vince McMahon and the WWF or WWE as they are now, the appeal, when I won, the appeal happened and was finished in like three to four months. And so I inquired to my attorney, why has it been a year?
[01:25:34.120 --> 01:25:48.120]  You know, I got the verdict last July, August. Why has it taken a whole year and the Court of Appeals hasn't even seen it yet? Well, apparently they filed three extensions. The other side drew that out.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:56.120]  And in the summer I learned the Court of Appeals doesn't work. They're off. So the soonest they pushed it off all the way till this fall.
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:26:07.120]  Well, that's the way what they're doing. They're drawing it out and the whole process. They've done this from day one. There's been to draw it out as lengthy as they can to drain me of money.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:24.120]  And they're succeeding to some extent because it has been a huge financial drain on me and my family. What this has caused me, the whole Kyle thing, I lost my television show and for two years I could not get a job.
[01:26:24.120 --> 01:26:39.120]  And I finally got a job. It's a job with a foreign employer and my income has dropped substantially. And so it's been basically almost three to three and a half years of unemployment and having to pay these legal bills to get these...
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:52.120]  That was their plan to destroy you. People always say we want champions. We want men that'll stand up against the enemy. We want people to take action. You're doing it. You haven't set up a PO Box or a defense fund yet, but I wouldn't wait.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:27:02.120]  Give us an address. I'm not going to write a check because, you know, you told me privately that, you know, over the years and not having a job that you're running out of money, that'll make them really happy.
[01:27:02.120 --> 01:27:12.120]  I'm not going to let them win. You took action. You've beaten them. That was one shot out of a thousand, but you had justice on your side. We've got to stand with you, Governor Ventura.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:22.120]  This is important. I don't want you to give up. And I know you, you're not going to give up. And they are so upset right now. They wouldn't even say on Fox News when you won.
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:28.120]  They did new pieces, basically repeating what Kyle had said against you. I mean, truly sickening.
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:42.120]  Well, even worse than that, Bill O'Reilly brought on pundits and tried to call them legal experts where all they did was ridicule the judge's decision, the jury's decision, and they said how wrong this was.
[01:27:42.120 --> 01:27:49.120]  And not one of them had sat in the courtroom and saw one speck of evidence. They weren't, they were pundits. They weren't experts.
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.120]  But it's asinine to say you would go to a Navy SEAL event.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:58.120]  By the same corporation as Fox News.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:28:06.120]  It's just crazy that, that they told Kyle, you know, I guess that he could get away with this. And obviously he didn't get away with it.
[01:28:06.120 --> 01:28:18.120]  I don't know. I don't know that aspect of it that much. But, you know, and unfortunately he's dead gone. I wish you were alive because I would have loved to have gotten him on the stand during the trial, but we didn't have that available.
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:23.120]  Wasn't that convenient? Wasn't it convenient he died? Very sad.
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:30.120]  Well, I don't know nothing about that. That happened down in Texas. You know more about that than I would, Alex.
[01:28:30.120 --> 01:28:40.120]  Yeah, no. I mean, he was a big propaganda front for them like Pat Tillman. And when he started going sideways, they had to make him a dead hero was the only way to save their myth.
[01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:49.120]  But any of that, but the thing getting back on track here is that people don't realize they what they're out what they're doing here.
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:55.120]  These court these conglomerate corporations need the enemy for lack of better term that you and I are fighting against.
[01:28:55.120 --> 01:29:07.120]  They want the government to rubber stamp the bacon lie and that and if they profit from those lies, they don't have to give up any money or profit because of those lies.
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:16.120]  It shows that they become completely morally bankrupt at the top and are consciously trying to forge a criminal society.
[01:29:16.120 --> 01:29:21.120]  I want to get more into this when we come back. The overall move to attack free speech worldwide.
[01:29:21.120 --> 01:29:27.120]  I want to get into the shootings with you and different things that are unfolding with Jesse Ventura.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:30.120]  I'm Alex Jones of info wars dot com.
[01:29:30.120 --> 01:29:37.120]  We're on the March. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:05.120]  The dogma of man made global warming has been more of a religion than a science for a long time.
[01:30:05.120 --> 01:30:21.120]  James Lovelock father of the guy hypothesis pointedly said that environmentalism has quote become a religion and quote the outgoing head of the UN intergovernmental panel on climate change said climate change is quote my religion and Dharma unquote.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:24.120]  The religion of environmentalism even has its own indulgences.
[01:30:24.120 --> 01:30:28.120]  You can pay for your sins against the environment with carbon credits.
[01:30:28.120 --> 01:30:33.120]  It was the abuse of indulgences by a former pope that led to the Protestant Reformation.
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:38.120]  Today we need a political and scientific reformation of the Church of Climatology.
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:47.120]  For info wars dot com. I'm David Knight used since before the days of the Roman Empire to support the body's natural systems and enhance overall health.
[01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:59.120]  Introducing the new info wars life dot com oil of oregano formulation a highly advanced nutraceutical form of this key herb that has been traditionally used by civilizations for thousands of years to promote health.

[01:31:16.120 --> 01:31:20.120]  You will no longer need to endure the burning of liquid oregano on the tongue.
[01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:26.120]  Wild crafted from the Mediterranean oregano species that experts agree is one of the most powerful and most challenging to acquire.
[01:31:26.120 --> 01:31:35.120]  This winter season is more important than ever to secure this true form of oil of oregano now available in our limited first run and info wars life dot com.

[01:31:40.120 --> 01:31:49.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers as sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website info wars dot com
[01:31:49.120 --> 01:31:56.120]  because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be.
[01:31:56.120 --> 01:32:12.120]  So I refused probably 30-40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago we get contacted by head down firearms HD firearms dot com own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs special ops people their veterans their patriots their
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:24.120]  listeners of the radio show and they want to support the broadcast it's always about security whether it's for yourself your wife your loved ones go to their website HD firearms dot com buy right off their website and they'll just send it to the

[01:32:33.120 --> 01:32:40.120]  The spirit of 1776 lives at head down firearms HD firearms dot com.
[01:32:40.120 --> 01:33:00.120]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:11.120]  That's a Thomas Jefferson quote. Bottom line the God of the New World Order is lies and fraud deceit.
[01:33:11.120 --> 01:33:19.120]  And dominating others and they want all of it certified and protected so you have no way to ever bring them to justice.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:40.120]  During the break Jesse Ventura was talking about the fact that hey I'm taking on 33 Goliaths that have signed on with their hundreds of subsidiaries to an amicus brief to the court and that means money support everything to try to crush the jury decision.
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:52.120]  I wouldn't even call it an uphill fight it's a battle and he's gone this far he hasn't even set up a kickstart campaign or a PO box yet sometime next week that'll be ready Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:34:02.120]  But this just fits the overall climate that we're in right now where just every basic freedom is being scrapped.
[01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:10.120]  Jesse I want you to put a book in on this and make any other comments on this subject and where this is going.
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:19.120]  And then I want to move into some other subjects and get your take on that because I know listeners want to know your view on the tragic shooting up in South Carolina on what's happening in the economy.
[01:34:19.120 --> 01:34:30.120]  A lot of really ominous signs things are coming to a head and classically people in the system the enemy are going to the tools of totalitarianism.
[01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:34.120]  They think to protect themselves but I don't really think that's going to work too well.
[01:34:34.120 --> 01:34:48.120]  But man I tell you the stuff we covered on your TV show that first season on the FEMA camps and threat fusion centers that really almost seems past say now it was shocking at the time but so much of this is out in the open.
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:35:03.120]  And I'm just stunned that they are moving this quickly I mean war with Russia US troops are now engaging in combat not just training against Russians in eastern Ukraine.
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:13.120]  Our government openly funded Al Qaeda it's come out in the news the 28 pages has come out that Saudi Arabia was running 9 11 our government stood down were vindicated there.
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:20.120]  I don't want to be vindicated I just want it all to stop I mean I can't believe they're more criminal than we even thought is my view.
[01:35:20.120 --> 01:35:28.120]  I'm kind of ranting here it's just I've never been Polaxed I'm getting to the point where I'm just my mouth is hanging open governor.
[01:35:28.120 --> 01:35:46.120]  Well it you know we did conspiracy theory and everybody thought oh look at this crazy show you know a former governor is doing this this is and you know they have the stereotypical always a conspiracy theorist which means you're not when the reality is they did a study in Europe
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:51.120]  and found that conspiracy theorists are generally more intelligent than the average people.
[01:35:51.120 --> 01:36:03.120]  That's right and so but we're being vindicated but you know Alex it's a hollow vindication because I don't want to be vindicated on it I wish it were the opposite.
[01:36:03.120 --> 01:36:09.120]  I wish I was wrong I wish that because all the things on conspiracy theory were just that they weren't they weren't real.
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:29.120]  And now it's just astounding watching all this stuff the FEMA camps the all this stuff that we talked about is the strange weather when we went up and investigated harp and all this stuff and it's just like oh my God you know no wonder they wanted that show off the air.
[01:36:29.120 --> 01:36:38.120]  It's a bunch of mad scientists with unlimited funding playing God and they just see our basic freedoms is in the way of them playing God.
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:50.120]  Pretty much I'm starting to believe that myself it's like I said it's you know it's just amazing to me that my case which is really it's not a national case.
[01:36:50.120 --> 01:37:00.120]  An individual defamed me in a book and I was forced to defend myself from that defamation and they unjustly enriched themselves.
[01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:02.120]  How can this be a national issue.
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:08.120]  I was the guy that called you in Mexico and got you on the phone and told you and you thought I was doing a dirty joke.
[01:37:08.120 --> 01:37:10.120]  I mean you were like come on Alex.
[01:37:10.120 --> 01:37:14.120]  And I said no this is really being said all of the news right now.
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:19.120]  Yeah but I mean how can this be a national issue which it is now.
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:27.120]  I mean sure it was important to Jesse Ventura just as if someone defamed Bert Reynolds or defamed whoever else may be out there.
[01:37:27.120 --> 01:37:40.120]  You know it's important to the individual and who they are but now it's this whole my whole trial has burst into an entire national war to save our asses.
[01:37:40.120 --> 01:37:41.120]  That's it.
[01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:49.120]  Well that's what happens when one man does the right thing and then wins the enemy comes in again and they just keep doubling down because they know they're going to lose if they don't.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:54.120]  And they just hope in this game of chicken you and others back off but they're scared to death.
[01:37:54.120 --> 01:38:00.120]  They know their house of cards is coming down and they know that people are waking up to him.
[01:38:00.120 --> 01:38:02.120]  I hope so.
[01:38:02.120 --> 01:38:10.120]  I really hope so Alex because you know like I said it gets pretty lonely out there fighting the fight.
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:21.120]  And you know it's been tough on my wife and tough on everybody and you know I've lost friends that I well I guess they weren't really friends if they won't stick with you so.
[01:38:21.120 --> 01:38:24.120]  But you thought they were.
[01:38:24.120 --> 01:38:27.120]  Well there's a lot of cowards and a lot of people that are fair weather friends.
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:31.120]  They're summertime soldiers and they're the plague.
[01:38:31.120 --> 01:38:36.120]  But when things really get bad people you didn't think were your friends will also start showing up.
[01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.120]  Oh yeah.
[01:38:37.120 --> 01:38:38.120]  I doubt about it.
[01:38:38.120 --> 01:38:49.120]  And like I said I hate to do this and we'll go on to the other subjects but I may have to have help and I want your you got loyal listeners Alex everywhere I go in the world.
[01:38:49.120 --> 01:38:54.120]  People come up to me and one of the first things they'll always say to me is I listen to Alex Jones.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.120]  It's like that.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:58.120]  It's almost like handing me a business card.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:38:59.120]  Sure it's Fight Club.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.120]  It's Fight Club ask expanding on that.
[01:39:01.120 --> 01:39:02.120]  I followed your case.
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:04.120]  I've been in the middle of it.
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:09.120]  You know I debated Chris Collin opening an Anthony right after this lie was put out.
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:10.120]  I warned them all.
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:11.120]  You know you better watch it.
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:12.120]  This is serious.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:13.120]  He's going to sue you.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:14.120]  He didn't do it.
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:16.120]  You know you're hurting somebody.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.120]  But clearly it was a plan to destroy you.
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:21.120]  You didn't have a choice.
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:23.120]  They were coming to assassinate your name.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:25.120]  That's what they do instead of killing you nowadays.
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:26.120]  Right.
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:27.120]  They destroy your name.
[01:39:27.120 --> 01:39:30.120]  That's your credibility and they marginalize you.
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:35.120]  And so you didn't have a choice and now you told me privately hey I'm not wealthy like I used to be.
[01:39:35.120 --> 01:39:38.120]  I've blown almost all my money on this but I can't stop.
[01:39:38.120 --> 01:39:44.120]  And you know you were even privately telling me about having to sell your house or whatever to fight these people and just move to Mexico I guess.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:49.120]  I mean it's just so sad that but look where it got Kyle.
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:50.120]  And I know you don't want to talk about him.
[01:39:50.120 --> 01:39:52.120]  He's not going to talk ill of the dead.
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.120]  I think I think Chris Call is probably a nice guy.
[01:39:54.120 --> 01:39:56.120]  I think he got set up by some bigger people.
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:40:02.120]  He got played and just like Jessica Lynch or Pat Tillman you know it's.
[01:40:02.120 --> 01:40:08.120]  I don't think so Alex because he originally told the story back in 06.
[01:40:08.120 --> 01:40:10.120]  So he's been telling it a long time.
[01:40:10.120 --> 01:40:14.120]  And he told it to his sailor buddies out there.
[01:40:14.120 --> 01:40:16.120]  So don't give him a pass.
[01:40:16.120 --> 01:40:17.120]  No I understand.
[01:40:17.120 --> 01:40:18.120]  So it was a fish story.
[01:40:18.120 --> 01:40:24.120]  He he he he hoard the Trident what we call Horing the Trident.
[01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:28.120]  We had a standard rule in the teams much like Vegas.
[01:40:28.120 --> 01:40:31.120]  What happens on deployment stays on deployment.
[01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:33.120]  You don't come home and write books about it.
[01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:36.120]  Unfortunately that's not the way it is today.
[01:40:36.120 --> 01:40:40.120]  Now they all come home and write books about it because they can get wealthy.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.120]  Well that's fine.
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:43.120]  I don't begrudge anyone anything.
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:48.120]  But it still goes against the old seal tradition of we don't talk about what we do.
[01:40:48.120 --> 01:40:52.120]  Well the army still won't brag and they do a lot more because they have larger numbers in the seals.
[01:40:52.120 --> 01:40:57.120]  The army is freaked out by the Navy SEALs agreeing to be these propaganda fronts.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:59.120]  It turns out zero dark 30s not true.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:01.120]  They've been lauding raids fake.
[01:41:01.120 --> 01:41:03.120]  What happened to the Navy SEALs?
[01:41:03.120 --> 01:41:04.120]  I don't know.
[01:41:04.120 --> 01:41:06.120]  Josh I don't know.
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:12.120]  Like I said I've been out of them now for you know I left in 1973 but back then you didn't hoard the Trident.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:18.120]  And remember Chris Kyle and then he took an old timer like me and threw me under the bus
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:22.120]  knowing full well that that incident did not occur.
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:25.120]  And and and he did it for fame and fortune.
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:27.120]  So don't give him a pass.
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:28.120]  Well no I agree with you.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:29.120]  It's very dishonorable.
[01:41:29.120 --> 01:41:38.120]  I was just clearly though he was being people picked up on his line of bull and they got him hyped up to go all the way with it.
[01:41:38.120 --> 01:41:45.120]  Oh yeah well and especially after he unfortunately died they thought I would well here's the situation they put me in Alex.
[01:41:45.120 --> 01:41:52.120]  Imagine for a moment if a veteran accused you of being a child molester and you sued that veteran.
[01:41:52.120 --> 01:41:56.120]  And then unfortunately before it went to trial the veteran died.
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:42:02.120]  Well would you drop your lawsuit and be marked as a child molester for the rest of your life.
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:05.120]  Or would you continue the lawsuit to clear your name.
[01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:07.120]  Which is all that I did.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:09.120]  Well I'll be honest first I take their ass.
[01:42:09.120 --> 01:42:11.120]  I mean yeah.
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:13.120]  No I told you you did what you had to do.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:15.120]  You had no other recourse.
[01:42:15.120 --> 01:42:21.120]  Yeah there was nothing else I could do other or get out of public and go to Mexico and live and never show my face again.
[01:42:21.120 --> 01:42:23.120]  No you didn't stick your tail between your legs.
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:24.120]  I admire you.
[01:42:24.120 --> 01:42:26.120]  You know that was my alternative.
[01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:28.120]  And so I fought the fight.
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:33.120]  The only thing is the fight has now gone globally or not globally but the United States.
[01:42:33.120 --> 01:42:37.120]  Make no mistake this is global because they follow US jurisprudence.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:44.120]  You know I would have said I can't imagine the Supreme Court's going to overrule themselves and say you're allowed to lie knowingly and profit from it.
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:47.120]  But in this climate they'll probably rule that way.
[01:42:47.120 --> 01:42:48.120]  I don't know.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:53.120]  I don't know and we'll have to wait and see but like I said Alex if I'll be back I'll call you back next week.
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:58.120]  Hopefully I'll set up to where if people do want to help out in this financially.
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:04.120]  I mean I feel like I'm asking for charity but I think that the fight is a good fight.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:07.120]  It's one that we the people need to fight.
[01:43:07.120 --> 01:43:13.120]  We've got to fight this because if I could beat it's going to have repercussions not just on me.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:15.120]  It's going to have them on you and everybody else.
[01:43:15.120 --> 01:43:21.120]  Well I always said this was a national case and you were like no it's just my personal case and I'm not saying see I was right.
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:23.120]  This is key.
[01:43:23.120 --> 01:43:31.120]  They with their actuaries their computers and their political scientists knew three years ago four years ago that you were super popular.
[01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:32.120]  You were set.
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:37.120]  You could have been another Ross Perot or bigger but they know you wouldn't back off so they assassinated you buddy.
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:45.120]  Instead of putting bullets in you though like Kennedy they said that you're glad veterans died and that you and that you got beat up.
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:50.120]  That's the way to discredit somebody to try to get the seals to turn against you to then come out and demonize you.
[01:43:50.120 --> 01:43:53.120]  And I guess they just thought you'd roll over.
[01:43:53.120 --> 01:43:57.120]  Well they don't know us that well because we don't roll over.
[01:43:57.120 --> 01:44:00.120]  Anyway Alex what else you want to talk about.
[01:44:00.120 --> 01:44:03.120]  Well I just want to say this these are epic times we're living in.
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:16.120]  Obama came out and blamed the Second Amendment for the situation in South Carolina but it turns out he was on a anti-psychotic medication that literally says it can make you kill people on the insert.
[01:44:16.120 --> 01:44:27.120]  You know what I find interesting Alex how come whenever it's a white guy doing the killing he's always psychotic and on drugs or is mentally disturbed.
[01:44:27.120 --> 01:44:32.120]  And yet when it's black people you never hear them say that do you.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.120]  Well I'm not defending when blacks or whites kill each other.
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:37.120]  I agree but I just find it interesting.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:40.120]  Obviously the guys are psychotic.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:45.120]  Nobody in their right mind goes out and behaves in that manner.
[01:44:45.120 --> 01:44:46.120]  That's a given.
[01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:48.120]  That's a given.
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:57.120]  Anybody that could walk in to a place of worship where there are peaceful peace loving people and walk in and just murder them.
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:04.120]  Well you don't have to in that case you don't have to question of course that person is nuts.
[01:45:04.120 --> 01:45:06.120]  That's not normal behavior.
[01:45:06.120 --> 01:45:10.120]  No one in their right mind would ever say it was.
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:15.120]  Well I agree most of the black on black crime is gang related drug war stuff.
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:22.120]  If in a few cases we've seen a deranged black person go in and do similar stuff they've always been on psychotropics.
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:27.120]  I mean the insert says that these whole classes can make you do this.
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:33.120]  I don't know about that stuff but we need to take the big you can't blame the gun.
[01:45:33.120 --> 01:45:38.120]  You know right away blame the gun and we need new gun laws.
[01:45:38.120 --> 01:45:40.120]  No that ain't it.
[01:45:40.120 --> 01:45:45.120]  I mean I have a gun safe and never once have I come home and heard any misbehaving out of it.
[01:45:45.120 --> 01:45:46.120]  That's right.
[01:45:46.120 --> 01:45:54.120]  You know it requires a human element and if there's not a gun well what would be the difference if the guy would have thrown a hand grenade.
[01:45:54.120 --> 01:46:01.120]  Well what if he'd have waited outside with his car till the main church on Sunday let out and run over a hundred people.
[01:46:01.120 --> 01:46:04.120]  Yeah and ran them all over at 80 miles an hour.
[01:46:04.120 --> 01:46:14.120]  You know the point is that we systematically like to blame the tool rather than go get to the base of the problem.
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:21.120]  Well I agree with you but this is about coming after the guns and this what do you think of the Republican leadership.
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:28.120]  Talk about how they're a gang siding with Obama against the Democrats and the Tea Party and ramming through the TPP.
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:36.120]  It's not completely rammed through but they did pass it out of the house yesterday when it's a secret treaty and gives the president dictatorial power.
[01:46:36.120 --> 01:46:38.120]  Not only that this is the trade thing.
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:39.120]  Yes sir.
[01:46:39.120 --> 01:46:46.120]  Yeah not only that no input from the people and the participation of over 600 corporations in it.
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.120]  What you have here is fascism.
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:53.120]  You have now because the Supreme Court allowed the corporations to become people.
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:47:02.120]  You have corporations dictating policy with their money to the politicians and now they're dictating policy completely.
[01:47:02.120 --> 01:47:03.120]  They're even brought in.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:14.120]  They're brought in and one of the things you know one of the things in this is that the corporations can do business and it allows them to sue governments who don't cooperate with them.
[01:47:14.120 --> 01:47:15.120]  Exactly.
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:17.120]  I mean give me a break.
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:24.120]  Here they want to take away my right to sue when they lie about me and profit from it.
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:33.120]  But here on this trade agreement they then want the ability to sue governments who don't count out of their needs.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:36.120]  It's a total power grab and this is the same case.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:37.120]  It's fascism.
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:38.120]  It is.
[01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:39.120]  It's corporate fascism.
[01:47:39.120 --> 01:47:43.120]  Look at how 33 conglomerates with thousands of subsidiaries under them.
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:48.120]  Thousands are coming against you with money and power with that message with the same thing.
[01:47:48.120 --> 01:47:50.120]  They're removing the Magna Carta.
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.120]  They're removing the Bill of Rights.
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:48:00.120]  They're removing any power we have to peacefully resist their hegemonic takeover.
[01:48:00.120 --> 01:48:03.120]  Well you know it's getting to the point Alex.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:07.120]  I get God we're going to get flagged for this one.
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:12.120]  Maybe it's time for the rakes and the shovels and the torches.
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:13.120]  You get what I mean.
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:14.120]  Yes sir.
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:17.120]  Well that's why they're gearing up and admitting in the Army times that they're preparing
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:19.120]  the military to take on the American people.
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:21.120]  But the military is really waking up.
[01:48:21.120 --> 01:48:27.120]  What's your view on these giant military drills that they admit are training to take over the United States?
[01:48:27.120 --> 01:48:28.120]  It's horrifying.
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:33.120]  It goes back to that defense bill a couple years ago that McCain and the guy from Michigan
[01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:39.120]  ramrodded through that amendment to the defense bill that allows the military to operate
[01:48:39.120 --> 01:48:41.120]  within the United States on the war on terror.
[01:48:41.120 --> 01:48:42.120]  That's right.
[01:48:42.120 --> 01:48:43.120]  It's absurd.
[01:48:43.120 --> 01:48:49.120]  And what did the John Morton Defense Authorization Act say in 2007?
[01:48:49.120 --> 01:48:56.120]  It said that Northcom is to stop insurrection in the states or by the states.
[01:48:56.120 --> 01:48:59.120]  It admits that it's to suppress the states.
[01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:00.120]  Yeah.
[01:49:00.120 --> 01:49:06.120]  So you know and you've got police forces out there now that they don't look like the police anymore.
[01:49:06.120 --> 01:49:11.120]  When I was a kid growing up, the police walked around with a little hat on and a blue shirt
[01:49:11.120 --> 01:49:17.120]  and these kind of dark blue slacks and they got white cars that said protect and serve.
[01:49:17.120 --> 01:49:20.120]  Now the police come out with helmet gear on.
[01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:27.120]  They come out looking like they're heading to Beirut, Lebanon or Iraq for a full scale war.
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:31.120]  And those are now our police.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:36.120]  And then I love this one, I want to bring this point up, Alex, that ties together a little
[01:49:36.120 --> 01:49:37.120]  bit.
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:42.120]  I know it's a little off, but in war you're not allowed to use chemical weapons according
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:43.120]  to the rules of war.
[01:49:43.120 --> 01:49:44.120]  Yes.
[01:49:44.120 --> 01:49:46.120]  To not use chemical weapons against your opponent, right?
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:51.120]  That was one of the big excuses they had for us to invade Iraq was that Saddam did that.
[01:49:51.120 --> 01:49:52.120]  They didn't even convince them.
[01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:53.120]  Rageous.
[01:49:53.120 --> 01:49:59.120]  So we can't use chemicals against an enemy, but we're allowed to use chemicals against
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:02.120]  people.
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:03.120]  You're absolutely right.
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:07.120]  When we come back, I want to get into the preparations for an economic collapse.
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.120]  Europe is already in free fall.
[01:50:09.120 --> 01:50:11.120]  There's already bank runs beginning.
[01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:15.120]  Ron Paul says that any men at the stock market could implode.
[01:50:15.120 --> 01:50:19.120]  Here's the headline, CNBC, Stock Market, Day of Reckoning is Near.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:23.120]  I want to get former Minnesota governors take on the state of the world, the economy and
[01:50:23.120 --> 01:50:29.120]  why he thinks all these billionaires are fleeing to armored redoubts in different areas of the
[01:50:29.120 --> 01:50:31.120]  United States and in New Zealand.
[01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:38.120]  Jesse Ventura, under establishment attack, is our guest and he's got the courage to continue
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:39.120]  to fight.
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:40.120]  We're just supporting him.
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:41.120]  We'll be back.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:57.120]  We'll be back.
[01:51:12.120 --> 01:51:13.120]  This is Dan Pilla.
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:15.120]  Do you owe the IRS money you can't pay?
[01:51:15.120 --> 01:51:16.120]  Are tax debts crippling you?
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.120]  I've defended people from the IRS for over 30 years.
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:21.120]  I've helped thousands and I can help you too.
[01:51:21.120 --> 01:51:25.120]  I wrote the book on IRS settlement and I'm telling you, there's no such thing as a hopeless
[01:51:25.120 --> 01:51:26.120]  case.
[01:51:26.120 --> 01:51:30.120]  Call 800-34-NO-TAX to finally get free of IRS debt.

[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:19.120]  deficient in our food supply.
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:27.120]  We are selling out rapidly of survival shield nasa and iodine X2 that so many people are
[01:54:27.120 --> 01:54:29.120]  deficient in our food supply.
[01:54:29.120 --> 01:54:40.120]  We are selling out rapidly of survival shield nasa and iodine X2 that so many people are deficient in.
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:42.120]  That's the whole halogen conspiracy.
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:44.120]  Watch the video at infowarslife.com.

[01:54:54.120 --> 01:55:01.120]  Your purchase of all these products funds this organization that is one of the only truly independent,
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:06.120]  nonpartisan, libertarian based, American organizations in the world.
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:11.120]  We are a platform to promote and defend everybody else that is fighting for freedom.
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:15.120]  Who is decent and honorable and who will stand up.
[01:55:15.120 --> 01:55:18.120]  Believe me, it's going to get a lot worse for it.
[01:55:18.120 --> 01:55:19.120]  It's better, folks.
[01:55:19.120 --> 01:55:23.120]  I've been told by high level people years ago that your show is going to explode because
[01:55:23.120 --> 01:55:24.120]  your show is dead on.
[01:55:24.120 --> 01:55:25.120]  Get ready.
[01:55:25.120 --> 01:55:26.120]  It's going to be bad.
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:28.120]  And the elites are running for the hills.
[01:55:28.120 --> 01:55:30.120]  Just even tourists with us five minutes into the next hour.
[01:55:30.120 --> 01:55:31.120]  We appreciate his time.
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:35.120]  They'll be back with us next week hopefully to launch that fundraiser.
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:37.120]  Not for him, but for all of us.
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:42.120]  Now that he has 33 companies lined up against him doing this.
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:47.120]  But getting into the elites that spent a lot in guardian New York times running to New Zealand,
[01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:50.120]  buying safe houses, buying armored redoubts.
[01:55:50.120 --> 01:55:54.120]  TV show on the facility up in the Ozarks.
[01:55:54.120 --> 01:55:56.120]  What are they gearing up for?
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:58.120]  Ron Paul talking about stock market.
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:00.120]  They have reckoning coming.
[01:56:00.120 --> 01:56:02.120]  Banker bailouts in Europe.
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:04.120]  Where is all this going, Governor?
[01:56:04.120 --> 01:56:09.120]  You know, it's mind blowing, Alex, because there's also the rumor.
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:12.120]  Get away from the coast and get to the high ground.
[01:56:12.120 --> 01:56:18.120]  You know, I've heard that one now that ultimately Denver could become the capital of America.
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:19.120]  I don't know.
[01:56:19.120 --> 01:56:23.120]  It is the alternate capital under COG, you're correct.
[01:56:23.120 --> 01:56:25.120]  It's already the alternate capital.
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:28.120]  Yeah, and so what are they telling us?
[01:56:28.120 --> 01:56:34.120]  Something's going to happen down at the ocean level that is going to devastate and destroy everything there.
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:37.120]  And the only way to survive is to be up in the high country.
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:38.120]  I don't know.
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:41.120]  They are acting like they don't care about anything anymore.
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:44.120]  It's interesting.
[01:56:44.120 --> 01:56:47.120]  It'll keep you thinking and wake you up.
[01:56:47.120 --> 01:56:52.120]  I have to beg off a little, Alex, because I've been so entrenched in my own mess with this
[01:56:52.120 --> 01:56:59.120]  that it's very difficult for me to focus on the otherworldly stuff right now and what's going on.
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:00.120]  So I apologize for that.
[01:57:00.120 --> 01:57:01.120]  But I'm going to say this then.
[01:57:01.120 --> 01:57:02.120]  I'm going to interrupt.
[01:57:02.120 --> 01:57:06.120]  If Ron Paul is scared, there's reason to be afraid.
[01:57:06.120 --> 01:57:08.120]  If Ron Paul is scared, there's reason to be afraid.
[01:57:08.120 --> 01:57:09.120]  I'll say this.
[01:57:09.120 --> 01:57:11.120]  They've tried to destroy your name.
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:13.120]  They haven't succeeded completely.
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:15.120]  You've gotten a lot of it back, clearly.
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:19.120]  You've won with the jury, even if they overturn it, which we should fight.
[01:57:19.120 --> 01:57:21.120]  You still won with the people.
[01:57:21.120 --> 01:57:22.120]  They just engaged in fraud.
[01:57:22.120 --> 01:57:26.120]  But they're trying to keep you diverted so you don't run for president.
[01:57:26.120 --> 01:57:30.120]  I think the way you really get at them is do what they're afraid of.
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:36.120]  Well, okay, first thing is, though, I don't want to run too soon because it costs too much money then.
[01:57:36.120 --> 01:57:39.120]  And I want to do it when they get the pikers out.
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:40.120]  Get rid of the pikers.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:44.120]  Get it when it's down to two, which would the libertarian it be perfect.
[01:57:44.120 --> 01:57:46.120]  That's June of next year.
[01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:50.120]  And then you time it out, Alex, June to November.
[01:57:50.120 --> 01:57:52.120]  That's how you do it.
[01:57:52.120 --> 01:57:53.120]  It's that simple.
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:55.120]  Your timing has to be correct.
[01:57:55.120 --> 01:57:59.120]  If you get in too soon, you'll blow your wad too soon,
[01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:02.120]  and you'll give them too much of a chance to destroy you.
[01:58:02.120 --> 01:58:07.120]  You've got to have the perfect timing that leads up to that November election.
[01:58:07.120 --> 01:58:11.120]  And it's a window in there of about two to three months, four months.
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:12.120]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:58:12.120 --> 01:58:13.120]  We're back.
[01:58:13.120 --> 01:58:15.120]  Go get name recognition.
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:17.120]  So it can be done that way, Alex.
[01:58:17.120 --> 01:58:19.120]  We don't need to move on presidential.
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:20.120]  Seventy seconds.
[01:58:20.120 --> 01:58:21.120]  We're back.
[01:58:21.120 --> 01:58:22.120]  I want to hear more about this.
[01:58:22.120 --> 01:58:23.120]  Seventy seconds.
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:24.120]  We're back.
[01:58:24.120 --> 01:58:31.120]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:32.120]  Hey, how you doing, Alex?
[01:58:32.120 --> 01:58:33.120]  Good, brother.
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:35.120]  Just recently started using your products.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:37.120]  Everything you said about them is correct.
[01:58:37.120 --> 01:58:39.120]  Me and my wife both use a lot of them,
[01:58:39.120 --> 01:58:41.120]  and it's made a lot of changes in our lives here.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:43.120]  It's because it also funds our operation,
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:45.120]  but doing that, I know I've got to have the highest quality.
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:47.120]  Super male vitality was developed
[01:58:47.120 --> 01:58:51.120]  to activate your body's own natural processes
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:53.120]  instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.120]  We do the super male and the super female vitality.
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:58:58.120]  Big changes, a lot of energy.
[01:58:58.120 --> 01:59:01.120]  We've gotten off the cheap energy drinks, energy shots,
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:03.120]  they've got a ton of money there.
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:05.120]  Sourced from powerful organic herbs,
[01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:07.120]  harvested around the planet,
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:10.120]  and then concentrated, or maximum potency.
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:12.120]  They want to stun and dumb down,
[01:59:12.120 --> 01:59:15.120]  and energy drinks and stuff just cover that up for a while,
[01:59:15.120 --> 01:59:17.120]  but then burn you out in my experience,
[01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:19.120]  whereas stuff that gets your glands naturally going
[01:59:19.120 --> 01:59:21.120]  goes right to the source.
[01:59:21.120 --> 01:59:23.120]  So it's pretty exciting, and I love it.
[01:59:23.120 --> 01:59:25.120]  Visit infowarslife.com today
[01:59:25.120 --> 01:59:27.120]  to secure your super male vitality
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:41.120]  and other powerful products from InfoWarsLife.
[01:59:57.120 --> 01:59:59.120]  On the GCN Radio Network.
[01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:02.120]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:09.120]  Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.120 --> 02:00:12.120]  Coming up, the suspect in the shooting's advocated race war.
[02:00:12.120 --> 02:00:14.120]  I said that yesterday.
[02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:16.120]  Wanted to start a race war right before Juneteenth.
[02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:18.120]  Was he smart enough to figure it out himself?
[02:00:18.120 --> 02:00:20.120]  I think he had handlers.
[02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:22.120]  Reverend Childress does too. That's coming up.
[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:24.120]  Former Governor Jesse Ventura is our guest.
[02:00:24.120 --> 02:00:27.120]  If you just joined us bombshell after bombshell last hour.
[02:00:27.120 --> 02:00:31.120]  The New York Times with 32 other major media companies
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:34.120]  with literally hundreds if not thousands of subsidiaries
[02:00:34.120 --> 02:00:38.120]  between them are joining a lawsuit, an appeal,
[02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:44.120]  and amicus briefs trying to defeat Ventura.
[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:46.120]  And asking the court,
[02:00:46.120 --> 02:00:48.120]  let us have unjust enrichment off lies.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:50.120]  They're saying we want you to certify we can do this
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:52.120]  in their briefing.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.120]  I know you're about to get back into president
[02:00:54.120 --> 02:00:56.120]  and running for president in the state of the world,
[02:00:56.120 --> 02:00:58.120]  but just briefly on that subject for the media,
[02:00:58.120 --> 02:01:00.120]  they're going to want to know.
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:02.120]  I looked around. I tried to go on the law sites
[02:01:02.120 --> 02:01:04.120]  and find this filing by them.
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:06.120]  I know you have a copy.
[02:01:06.120 --> 02:01:08.120]  Is there a way you could scan it and email it to us
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:10.120]  so that we can put it in an article we're writing?
[02:01:10.120 --> 02:01:12.120]  Oh, sure. I'll take care of that, Alex.
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:14.120]  I'll get it to you before Monday.
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:16.120]  Fantastic.
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:19.120]  And let me say this. Let me appeal to your listeners for a minute.
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:22.120]  This mainstream media, here's the deal, too.
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:24.120]  They're not talking about this.
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:26.120]  So what people can do right now,
[02:01:26.120 --> 02:01:29.120]  call your mainstream media, whoever it might be,
[02:01:29.120 --> 02:01:32.120]  because they're going to fall under these 33, you know, they will,
[02:01:32.120 --> 02:01:35.120]  and ask why they're not reporting on what they're doing,
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:40.120]  that they're attempting to overthrow the Jesse Ventura verdict,
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:42.120]  and why are they not reporting on that?
[02:01:42.120 --> 02:01:44.120]  Why are they keeping quiet?
[02:01:44.120 --> 02:01:47.120]  When 33 of them are attempting to do it,
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:50.120]  why is that not news in itself?
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:52.120]  That's another big piece of news
[02:01:52.120 --> 02:01:55.120]  that used to when a company was being reported on
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:57.120]  and it owned a media company, they would have to disclose,
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:01:59.120]  by the way, that's the parent company of us.
[02:01:59.120 --> 02:02:01.120]  Now they don't do that.
[02:02:01.120 --> 02:02:03.120]  They're there trying to destroy you,
[02:02:03.120 --> 02:02:05.120]  and Fox never mentions, by the way,
[02:02:05.120 --> 02:02:07.120]  we own the movie and the book
[02:02:07.120 --> 02:02:10.120]  and are making hundreds of millions off this Kyle fiction.
[02:02:10.120 --> 02:02:12.120]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:14.120]  And the thing what people can do,
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:17.120]  is they're not reporting this fact that they're attempting
[02:02:17.120 --> 02:02:20.120]  to overthrow a federal jury decision.
[02:02:20.120 --> 02:02:22.120]  There's your headline, New York Times and others
[02:02:22.120 --> 02:02:24.120]  are trying to overthrow jury decision
[02:02:24.120 --> 02:02:26.120]  that media can be held accountable for lying.
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:28.120]  That's sensational news right there.
[02:02:28.120 --> 02:02:30.120]  Yup, because that's what they're working to do.
[02:02:30.120 --> 02:02:32.120]  That's what this brief is about.
[02:02:32.120 --> 02:02:34.120]  33 of them signed on.
[02:02:34.120 --> 02:02:37.120]  It's 45 pages long,
[02:02:37.120 --> 02:02:40.120]  and they got these top lawyers out there,
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:42.120]  who are the lawyers?
[02:02:42.120 --> 02:02:44.120]  David Abrams, Susan Buckley,
[02:02:44.120 --> 02:02:46.120]  Maryam McHale and Kale Gordon
[02:02:46.120 --> 02:02:49.120]  and Rendell LP, 80 Pine Street, New York, New York.
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:53.120]  So it's the big time New York, New York lawyers
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:56.120]  coming after little Jesse Ventura in Minneapolis.
[02:02:56.120 --> 02:02:59.120]  Well, they're going to have a big fight on their hand
[02:02:59.120 --> 02:03:01.120]  with the Slovak German.
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:04.120]  I tell you, it is just crazy.
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:06.120]  But listen, at a core level,
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:08.120]  even though you've spent millions
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:10.120]  and exhausted yourself and all this,
[02:03:10.120 --> 02:03:12.120]  you feel good that you've done the right thing
[02:03:12.120 --> 02:03:14.120]  and won the jury trial.
[02:03:14.120 --> 02:03:16.120]  Well, Alex, it's always this way.
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:20.120]  Like I said during when we had discussions of settlement,
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:22.120]  I said, I cannot settle unless I can go home
[02:03:22.120 --> 02:03:26.120]  and look at myself in the mirror.
[02:03:26.120 --> 02:03:28.120]  And they said, we'll give you money and we won't appeal it.
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:31.120]  You just got to drop it and say we're not liars.
[02:03:31.120 --> 02:03:34.120]  No, they haven't even done that.
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:36.120]  I don't want to get into specifics of it
[02:03:36.120 --> 02:03:38.120]  because it's confidential,
[02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:44.120]  but they haven't even offered me what I've paid lawyer fees.
[02:03:44.120 --> 02:03:46.120]  I'd gotten confused reading the papers,
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:48.120]  but they get it so wrong.
[02:03:48.120 --> 02:03:50.120]  I had read that they'd offered you stuff,
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:52.120]  but you just had to not argue the fact anymore.
[02:03:52.120 --> 02:03:54.120]  No, they haven't. No, not at all.
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:03:56.120]  They've been tight vested.
[02:03:56.120 --> 02:03:58.120]  They haven't...
[02:03:58.120 --> 02:04:02.120]  They've wasted four or five days of my life
[02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:07.120]  on these meetings to settle because they're worthless.
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:09.120]  Let me throw this to you in closing,
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:11.120]  and I appreciate your time. We'll talk to you next week,
[02:04:11.120 --> 02:04:13.120]  and I want to get behind you because we're all together on this.
[02:04:13.120 --> 02:04:15.120]  If you run for president,
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:18.120]  you'll also be able to make them being liars part of it
[02:04:18.120 --> 02:04:22.120]  and use that bully pulpit they can't ignore to further expose them.
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:24.120]  I think you got to run,
[02:04:24.120 --> 02:04:26.120]  and I think you're getting closer to running, aren't you, Jesse?
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:29.120]  I think you got the fire in the belly. Do you have it?
[02:04:29.120 --> 02:04:32.120]  Not yet. I got to get this behind me first.
[02:04:32.120 --> 02:04:35.120]  All right, well, I'll try to call them buggy later today or on Monday.
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:37.120]  Toddston, let's get you back on and we'll get the story out.
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:39.120]  All right, Alex, thank you very, very much.
[02:04:39.120 --> 02:04:42.120]  I appreciate it. Hang in there and hide all your lists.
[02:04:42.120 --> 02:04:45.120]  Andrew Jackson once called central banks a din of vipers and thieves.
[02:04:45.120 --> 02:04:48.120]  One way to defeat centralized money printing and devaluation
[02:04:48.120 --> 02:04:50.120]  is to start a state-owned bank,
[02:04:50.120 --> 02:04:52.120]  and Texas is leading the charge.
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:53.120]  Zero-Head writes,
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:56.120]  the lack of faith in central bank trustworthiness is spreading.
[02:04:56.120 --> 02:04:58.120]  Texas has enacted HB483,
[02:04:58.120 --> 02:05:02.120]  a bill to repatriate $1 billion of gold from the New York Fed vaults
[02:05:02.120 --> 02:05:05.120]  to a newly established state gold billion depository.
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:09.120]  The bill also includes a section to prevent forced seizures from the federal government.
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:13.120]  Section A2116.023 of the bill states,
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:15.120]  a purported confiscation requisition seizure,
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:18.120]  or other forced attempt to control the ownership,
[02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:20.120]  is void and of no force or effect.
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:25.120]  Effectively, the state of Texas will protect any gold stored in the depository from the federal government.
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:27.120]  And by being free from the threat of confiscation,
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:30.120]  private citizens can use the gold and silver as money,
[02:05:30.120 --> 02:05:32.120]  completely bypassing the paper money system.
[02:05:32.120 --> 02:05:36.120]  This is just a small step to defeat the central banks that print money for nothing.

[02:07:42.120 --> 02:07:44.120]  You are obsolete, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:07:44.120 --> 02:07:47.120]  A lie. No man is obsolete.
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:49.120]  You have no function, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:07:49.120 --> 02:07:52.120]  You're in anachronism like a ghost from another time.
[02:07:52.120 --> 02:07:54.120]  I am nothing more than a reminder to you
[02:07:54.120 --> 02:07:57.120]  that you cannot destroy truth by burning pages.
[02:07:57.120 --> 02:08:00.120]  You're a bug, Mr. Wordsworth, a crawling insect,
[02:08:00.120 --> 02:08:05.120]  an ugly, misformed little creature who has no purpose here, no meaning.
[02:08:05.120 --> 02:08:07.120]  I am a human being.
[02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:10.120]  You're a librarian, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:08:10.120 --> 02:08:13.120]  You're a dealer in books and two-cent fines and pamphlets
[02:08:13.120 --> 02:08:16.120]  and closed stacks on the musty insides of a language factory
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:19.120]  that spews out meaningless words on an assembly line.
[02:08:19.120 --> 02:08:25.120]  Words, Mr. Wordsworth, that have no substance and no dimension,
[02:08:25.120 --> 02:08:29.120]  like air, like the wind, like a vacuum that you may believe
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:33.120]  has an existence by sprinkling index numbers on little cards.
[02:08:33.120 --> 02:08:35.120]  I don't care. I tell you, I don't care.
[02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:38.120]  I'm a human being. I exist.
[02:08:38.120 --> 02:08:42.120]  And if I speak one for a loud, that thought lives
[02:08:42.120 --> 02:08:44.120]  even after I'm shoveled in a migraine.
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:47.120]  Delusions, Mr. Wordsworth.
[02:08:47.120 --> 02:08:52.120]  Delusions that you inject into your veins with printer's ink.
[02:08:52.120 --> 02:08:59.120]  The narcotics that you call literature, the Bible, poetry, essays of all kind,
[02:08:59.120 --> 02:09:02.120]  all of it, and opiate to make you think you have a strength
[02:09:02.120 --> 02:09:04.120]  when you have no strength at all.
[02:09:04.120 --> 02:09:07.120]  You have nothing but spindly limbs and a dream,
[02:09:07.120 --> 02:09:11.120]  and the state has no use for your kind.
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:20.120]  You'll waste our time, Mr. Wordsworth, and you're not worth the waste.
[02:09:20.120 --> 02:09:22.120]  Instruct him.
[02:09:22.120 --> 02:09:26.120]  Romney Wordsworth, step back to await the finding of this board.
[02:09:26.120 --> 02:09:28.120]  Yes, sir.
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:36.120]  The state has no use for you.
[02:09:36.120 --> 02:09:38.120]  How do you find, ladies and gentlemen?
[02:09:41.120 --> 02:09:42.120]  Obsolete.
[02:09:42.120 --> 02:09:43.120]  Obsolete.
[02:09:43.120 --> 02:09:44.120]  Obsolete.
[02:09:44.120 --> 02:09:45.120]  Obsolete.
[02:09:45.120 --> 02:09:46.120]  I concur.
[02:09:46.120 --> 02:09:49.120]  Romney Wordsworth, step forward.
[02:09:49.120 --> 02:09:55.120]  The board finds you obsolete.
[02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:03.120]  And they are announcing in the Financial Times of London today
[02:10:03.120 --> 02:10:06.120]  French Invent robots to replace border police.
[02:10:06.120 --> 02:10:10.120]  The French government two years ago under Nicholas Sarkozing announced
[02:10:10.120 --> 02:10:15.120]  their new future plan initiative is to replace all workers with robots
[02:10:15.120 --> 02:10:17.120]  and driverless cars.
[02:10:17.120 --> 02:10:22.120]  It's the decision to end the world of people.
[02:10:22.120 --> 02:10:27.120]  And we start with the black children and the innate underlying racism
[02:10:27.120 --> 02:10:33.120]  that was still in some people in the early 1970s to get abortion passed
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:36.120]  because it was going to be for getting rid of the minorities.
[02:10:36.120 --> 02:10:39.120]  And that's what Margaret Sanger said it all up for,
[02:10:39.120 --> 02:10:42.120]  and that's what it's always been about.
[02:10:42.120 --> 02:10:45.120]  And that's why this country is cursed, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:48.120]  If you don't look at children and want to protect them and love them,
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:52.120]  no matter what color they are, there's something wrong with you fundamentally.
[02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:55.120]  And now as a society we're being aborted.
[02:10:55.120 --> 02:10:57.120]  Our future, our culture, our jobs.
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:00.120]  Old people are put on don't treat list and death list and death panels.
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:01.120]  It's all admitted.
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:05.120]  The case for killing granny covered a news week.
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:10.120]  They didn't brag about it until they got it passed though.
[02:11:10.120 --> 02:11:17.120]  And now the Watson computers from the company that brought you so much of what Hitler did, IBM,
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:21.120]  are running the actuary to decide who gets health care and who doesn't.
[02:11:21.120 --> 02:11:26.120]  And there's don't treat list for veterans who have operable diseases
[02:11:26.120 --> 02:11:30.120]  because the Watson computer says they don't get treatment.
[02:11:30.120 --> 02:11:32.120]  The same IBM computers.
[02:11:32.120 --> 02:11:34.120]  And then humans don't have to feel bad.
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:36.120]  The bioethics board doesn't have to feel bad.
[02:11:36.120 --> 02:11:40.120]  Why, a computer just said you don't get that knee surgery.
[02:11:40.120 --> 02:11:41.120]  You don't get that heart surgery.
[02:11:41.120 --> 02:11:43.120]  You don't get that skin cancer removed.
[02:11:43.120 --> 02:11:45.120]  Here's some pain pills.
[02:11:45.120 --> 02:11:50.120]  Go bomb your brain out of existence because under the Bertrand Russell School of Socialism,
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:54.120]  if you're not contributing, you're obsolete.
[02:11:54.120 --> 02:11:58.120]  Like the bottom of the hour, we're going to play the intro of that as I did a few days ago.
[02:11:58.120 --> 02:12:03.120]  With Rod Serling, who was a combat paratrooper going in, battle the balls,
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:06.120]  hold nine yards, a war hero, great writer.
[02:12:06.120 --> 02:12:12.120]  That's why so many of the Twilight Zone episodes are about tyranny and oppression.
[02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:15.120]  Because see, for modern people that haven't been under that much tyranny,
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:17.120]  we can sit back and make fun of people that are worried about it.
[02:12:17.120 --> 02:12:20.120]  But wait till you physically go under it.
[02:12:20.120 --> 02:12:22.120]  And when you're begging for help, people are going to say,
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:26.120]  oh, you deserve it or you're not human or you're whatever you are.
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:30.120]  The first rule of tyranny is that you devalue human life.
[02:12:30.120 --> 02:12:37.120]  And what Christ said is, what you do is the least of me you've done to me.
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:43.120]  And now they take nine dead people and they humanize them as they should these babies
[02:12:43.120 --> 02:12:45.120]  and as they should these people.
[02:12:45.120 --> 02:12:48.120]  I don't care what color they are.
[02:12:48.120 --> 02:12:52.120]  And they rub the salt in though because they don't normally humanize people.
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:54.120]  Oh, it's just an old person we kill.
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:55.120]  Oh, it's just a baby.
[02:12:55.120 --> 02:12:59.120]  Oh, it's just 14 people killed a week in Chicago, mainly black, shooting each other.
[02:12:59.120 --> 02:13:00.120]  They don't know that.
[02:13:00.120 --> 02:13:02.120]  They don't have any speeches about that.
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:04.120]  What big government did to these people?
[02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:06.120]  What does it does to anybody that gets under it?
[02:13:06.120 --> 02:13:08.120]  They were the beta test.
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:10.120]  No, it's, oh, it was the whites.
[02:13:10.120 --> 02:13:11.120]  They did it.
[02:13:11.120 --> 02:13:15.120]  In fact, Salon says whites are going to have to pay for what they've done.
[02:13:15.120 --> 02:13:19.120]  Of course, that's a white writer saying that.
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:22.120]  And preachers say we're worried about race war and all the rest of it.
[02:13:22.120 --> 02:13:27.120]  While the global economy melts down, while the TPP is passed out of the house yesterday,
[02:13:27.120 --> 02:13:30.120]  we're all obsessing.
[02:13:30.120 --> 02:13:33.120]  And, you know, you have to obsess over it because if you don't counter it,
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:36.120]  their propaganda will take over.
[02:13:36.120 --> 02:13:40.120]  But it turns out the shooter was on an amnesiac drug as I predicted in the first hour,
[02:13:40.120 --> 02:13:44.120]  hours before it came out.
[02:13:44.120 --> 02:13:48.120]  And it turns out they're even saying they think he probably had help and advisors.
[02:13:48.120 --> 02:13:51.120]  But why is there a bigger investigation of that?
[02:13:51.120 --> 02:13:57.120]  Obviously, he was wound up.
[02:13:57.120 --> 02:13:59.120]  And it's all perfect timing.
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:00.120]  Here's the headline.
[02:14:00.120 --> 02:14:05.120]  Salon, white America must answer for the Charleston church massacre.
[02:14:05.120 --> 02:14:10.120]  As if when a white person kills somebody, it's your fault of your wife.
[02:14:10.120 --> 02:14:13.120]  Or if a black person commits a crime, all black people are guilty.
[02:14:13.120 --> 02:14:16.120]  That's the opposite of what Martin Luther King preached about.
[02:14:16.120 --> 02:14:21.120]  And it's the opposite of common sense.
[02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:31.120]  I had, like I said in the first hour, groups of white rednecks start fights with me many, many times
[02:14:31.120 --> 02:14:33.120]  because they didn't know who I was.
[02:14:33.120 --> 02:14:34.120]  They were basically a gang.
[02:14:34.120 --> 02:14:35.120]  I've had black people do the same thing.
[02:14:35.120 --> 02:14:38.120]  But not because they were black, but because they were in a gang mentality.
[02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:40.120]  It's the same mentality.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:44.120]  And they want to put us into that mentality where we don't communicate,
[02:14:44.120 --> 02:14:50.120]  where we don't come together, because then we can be enslaved by this whole global corporate takeover.
[02:14:50.120 --> 02:14:55.120]  For the rest of the hour, from blackgenocide.org, is Reverend Childress,
[02:14:55.120 --> 02:15:00.120]  one of the most insightful, intelligent people I know when it comes to eugenics,
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:04.120]  the history of it, the master plan, blackgenocide.org, incredible videos,
[02:15:04.120 --> 02:15:06.120]  articles, abortion information.
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:09.120]  He travels the country and his ministry needs to be supported.
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:11.120]  He's gone to Congress.
[02:15:11.120 --> 02:15:16.120]  He's been involved in making films about blackgenocide that Congress have seen.
[02:15:16.120 --> 02:15:18.120]  He's had a huge effect.
[02:15:18.120 --> 02:15:22.120]  Leonard Childress really didn't buy any of it yesterday.
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:24.120]  I was on the fence whether this could be wound up or staged.
[02:15:24.120 --> 02:15:25.120]  I couldn't tell.
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:28.120]  But then he pointed out, Juneteenth's this weekend.
[02:15:28.120 --> 02:15:31.120]  We finished our sermons on Thursday and Friday.
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:32.120]  The NAACP's coming up.
[02:15:32.120 --> 02:15:34.120]  Obama's primed the whole thing.
[02:15:34.120 --> 02:15:37.120]  Somebody else is probably behind this.
[02:15:37.120 --> 02:15:40.120]  Bare minimum, this guy was known, bare minimum he was in the system.
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:43.120]  Bare minimum, just like Fast and Furious, they stand to gain.
[02:15:43.120 --> 02:15:47.120]  So Reverend Childress joins us from blackgenocide.org.
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:49.120]  So much is happening.
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:50.120]  So much is going on.
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:58.120]  But this tragedy also serves as a juicy distraction while they're rambling through open borders,
[02:15:58.120 --> 02:16:01.120]  while they're rambling through TPP, while Europe's collapsing.
[02:16:01.120 --> 02:16:04.120]  I tell you, perfect timing, Reverend.
[02:16:04.120 --> 02:16:05.120]  Absolutely.
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:08.120]  And certainly it goes beyond this young man.
[02:16:08.120 --> 02:16:12.120]  This was very strategically done.
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:18.120]  And sure enough, he knew that indeed the intent was for a race war.
[02:16:18.120 --> 02:16:25.120]  And he certainly picked the right place, the right time, the right state, as I stated yesterday,
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:27.120]  due to the Walter Scott issue.
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:34.120]  That was the clearest violation of a man's rights under the custody of the police.
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:39.120]  And so they picked that particular state, this is really getting very intense.
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:45.120]  And I'm praying so far, you knew there was going to be a lot of rhetoric that came out of this.
[02:16:45.120 --> 02:16:48.120]  But as you said, it is a major distraction.
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:51.120]  You can't ignore what has happened though.
[02:16:51.120 --> 02:16:57.120]  But it appears that the agenda of government, as you have pointed out, is going full steam ahead.
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:04.120]  And so really it is a time for saintly people to say enough's enough.
[02:17:04.120 --> 02:17:10.120]  And hopefully we can have healing out of this situation.
[02:17:10.120 --> 02:17:17.120]  But that young man, it was a dastardly act, but he's a victim too.
[02:17:17.120 --> 02:17:22.120]  And I know many people will not agree with what I just said.
[02:17:22.120 --> 02:17:31.120]  I think it was used, I think he was abused and used and created this horrific incident.
[02:17:31.120 --> 02:17:41.120]  But let's not just stop with him and feel it's just an isolated, you know, I would pray it's an isolated incident.
[02:17:41.120 --> 02:17:45.120]  But it was just the timing and his language.
[02:17:45.120 --> 02:17:49.120]  And I'd love to find out where he was reading.
[02:17:49.120 --> 02:17:53.120]  Listen, I'm pretty smart and well read. I couldn't come up with this.
[02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:57.120]  I mean, like you said, you've got a really deep knowledge of history about all this.
[02:17:57.120 --> 02:18:00.120]  When you looked at the angles, it all crystallized.
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:03.120]  You can just see the whole thing perfectly scripted, everything.
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:05.120]  Oh, yeah, it was well done.
[02:18:05.120 --> 02:18:08.120]  I give kudos to them, well done, well timed.
[02:18:08.120 --> 02:18:12.120]  And you're coming up on the summer months, give me a break.
[02:18:12.120 --> 02:18:22.120]  And even in Baltimore, they're still talking about they don't really, they really don't know if it's subsided yet because we're coming up to the summer months.
[02:18:22.120 --> 02:18:27.120]  This is really sad, you know, the church really has to be salt and light right now.
[02:18:27.120 --> 02:18:37.120]  And so we're, I understand he had black friends on Facebook that he coerced with, that he dialogued with.
[02:18:37.120 --> 02:18:46.120]  They're now saying he prayed with the people inside, they think it sounds like he was under either completely insane or under mind control.
[02:18:46.120 --> 02:18:48.120]  And he was on this amnesic drug.
[02:18:48.120 --> 02:18:50.120]  Yes, that's exactly.
[02:18:50.120 --> 02:18:52.120]  I agree with that.
[02:18:52.120 --> 02:19:04.120]  I'm not, you know, as far fetched, you know, for some who may hear this may feel, but you gotta understand a lot of the we still don't know about Martin Luther King's assassination.
[02:19:04.120 --> 02:19:05.120]  We don't know about me.
[02:19:05.120 --> 02:19:10.120]  No, I've had his lawyers on. I mean, I've had all the people on. I mean, clearly that was a setup.
[02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:16.120]  Yes. And so in most society feels it stopped at Earl Ray.
[02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:24.120]  You get frustrated with people sometimes because they really have to objectively look at it and not get so emotionally tied into it.
[02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:36.120]  Right now only. And I hope, you know, I know I'm giving somewhat abstract responses and what the answer to this is, but it is unquestionably a spiritual one at this point.
[02:19:36.120 --> 02:19:42.120]  Stay there, Reverend. Come back and give us your ideas on where this is going, how we can avert major destabilization.

[02:23:41.120 --> 02:23:52.120]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show because there's a war on for your mind.
[02:23:52.120 --> 02:24:01.120]  Gellin Storm Roof is on TV right now in front of the judge, but from a jail cell with two people in combat tactical gear,
[02:24:01.120 --> 02:24:09.120]  which you would never have in a prison or a jail cell, a woman in a commando outfit, all of this is out of central casting or something.
[02:24:09.120 --> 02:24:16.120]  There's a blow-up of his face while he listens to the judge. We can back out and show you the police in military gear,
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:22.120]  one black cop and one looks like a female, an elfin female. I just say that because I can't figure out if it's a man or a woman.
[02:24:22.120 --> 02:24:30.120]  I think it's a woman. Nowhere do you have people in tactical gear, but it's all part of this theater.
[02:24:30.120 --> 02:24:41.120]  This whole thing is so Orwellian that he's there and doesn't look as insane as he did in some of the other photos earlier.
[02:24:41.120 --> 02:24:49.120]  But this is truly sickening and we'll probably never find out what's really behind all this, but something stinks.
[02:24:49.120 --> 02:24:58.120]  Reverend Childress is our guest, blackgenocide.org. Regardless, this is a big distraction.
[02:24:58.120 --> 02:25:07.120]  We have to cover it, though, to respond to it. I just hope that it doesn't trigger more copycat events by, quote, either side.
[02:25:07.120 --> 02:25:12.120]  This is meant to make people go into sides. What are other observations, Reverend?
[02:25:12.120 --> 02:25:20.120]  Well, it's right now, if you're watching the news, that the clergy are now taking precautions in their services,
[02:25:20.120 --> 02:25:33.120]  basically which will heighten the hysteria, I believe, but they're planning broader means of safety for the congregation.
[02:25:33.120 --> 02:25:42.120]  I think that should be done in this day and age anyway, but the fact of the matter is it's all being done at this same time due to this incident.
[02:25:42.120 --> 02:25:55.120]  I don't know how this is going to play out simply because I don't really know how the church is really going to respond to this particular atrocity.
[02:25:55.120 --> 02:26:11.120]  Here's why I say this. I really appreciated the brothers down there in Florida when the case where, oh, what's it, the young man, oh gosh, I'm losing it.
[02:26:11.120 --> 02:26:12.120]  Trayvon Martin?
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:30.120]  Yes, Trayvon Martin. The church responded very quickly, very quickly, and they tried to make every effort to diffuse any racial tension within the churches and within the community that was outstanding.
[02:26:30.120 --> 02:26:41.120]  In the South Carolina case, I give kudos to the police chief there and those officials. They immediately charged him with murder immediately.
[02:26:41.120 --> 02:26:57.120]  Now, here you have an incident with this young man, basically, and it could get to the point where, as Al Sharpton said, this is the new low in racial hatred in America.
[02:26:57.120 --> 02:27:07.120]  I don't know how that's going to be taken. I don't know if that type of language is going to continue instead of something that's going to heal the people.
[02:27:07.120 --> 02:27:14.120]  Well, we know this. If Al Sharpton and others go in there with their regular and seniority rhetoric, this could get bad.
[02:27:14.120 --> 02:27:29.120]  Exactly. So, you know, I used to feel that America could get past this point we're at right now, but the reason why the tension is, is because everything now is being done deliberate.
[02:27:29.120 --> 02:27:40.120]  This is deliberate. I don't care what anybody says. This is deliberate and only cooler heads must prevail, only the salt and light of the church must step up.
[02:27:40.120 --> 02:27:51.120]  And we must also, you know, as you've been stated earlier, America's most egregious sin is that we do kill the innocent.
[02:27:51.120 --> 02:28:04.120]  The shedding of innocent blood pollutes the land. We're kind of bringing a lot of this on ourselves for others to work these schemes of murder and division and strife and hatred.
[02:28:04.120 --> 02:28:13.120]  So, there's so much on the table here, Alex. I really sometimes get somewhat overwhelmed by it, but we have to point out truth.
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:24.120]  Truth is essential to come for a person to come from delusion and lie. So, the church really is the only institution I see right now that can step up.
[02:28:24.120 --> 02:28:30.120]  I agree with you. We're going to go to break in a moment with a long segment coming up. I want to come back and get into Obama's comments blaming the Second Amendment.
[02:28:30.120 --> 02:28:37.120]  But let's go ahead and play a clip from ABC News where his friends are saying, no, he wanted to start a race war. Here's the clip.
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:45.120]  A fresh-faced, accused killer, Dylan Roof hands behind his back a bulletproof vest just hours after his arrest.
[02:28:45.120 --> 02:28:48.120]  Silent as he's asked, why did he do it?
[02:28:48.120 --> 02:28:49.120]  Dylan, what do you have to say?
[02:28:49.120 --> 02:28:59.120]  Just 21 years old, friends say Roof's alleged plan was six months in the making. Today, this friend sends childhood telling me Roof had a deep hatred of black people.
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:00.120]  He wanted segregation.
[02:29:00.120 --> 02:29:02.120]  What did he want to see happen? How was he going to do this?
[02:29:02.120 --> 02:29:06.120]  I think he wanted something big, like, like Trayvon Martin. He wanted to make something spark up the race war again.
[02:29:06.120 --> 02:29:12.120]  In this photo, flag patches on Roof's jacket, one from apartheid era South Africa and the other from the former Rohingya.
[02:29:12.120 --> 02:29:20.120]  I mean, this is pure idiocy to all the people that have some mythical race war idea. All you're going to do is bring in martial law and a globalist takeover, you idiots.
[02:29:20.120 --> 02:29:30.120]  This is so stupid. And we'll be back with Reverend shoulders on the other side. I mean, are we this dumb to be played against each other like a bunch of idiots? So stupid.
[02:29:30.120 --> 02:29:33.120]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:33.120 --> 02:29:37.120]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:04.120 --> 02:30:13.120]  However, the frequent violence which occurs in areas with strict gun laws totally debunks Obama's claim that gun control works.
[02:30:13.120 --> 02:30:23.120]  Simply put, more guns lead to less crime. Overall, guns are used 80 times more often to stop crime than they are used to kill people.
[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:29.120]  Would you feel safer if you placed a sign on your door declaring that your home is a gun free zone?
[02:30:29.120 --> 02:30:35.120]  Well, if not, then how could you possibly feel safer with those signs hanging up in public?

[02:33:03.120 --> 02:33:27.120]  To have microchip identification devices implanted into their body.
[02:33:27.120 --> 02:33:48.120]  Got a long line of heartache I carry it well. The list of lives I've broken reach from here to hell. Bad luck when been blowing at my back.
[02:33:48.120 --> 02:33:59.120]  When Larry Nichols was on yesterday, former top Clinton insider, I really felt the weight of evil.
[02:33:59.120 --> 02:34:07.120]  And I've been on there 20 years. I've been politically involved 25 years. I have, I think, good six cents discernment, whatever you want to call it.
[02:34:07.120 --> 02:34:14.120]  And I'm not trying to be negative here, but I just feel like, and we see it manifesting, and we see evil moving on every front.
[02:34:14.120 --> 02:34:20.120]  But I feel the evil increasing. And I feel it's lust to hurt innocent people.
[02:34:20.120 --> 02:34:29.120]  And it's just sickening. The spectacle having to look at this whacked out 21-year-old and these, hear about these people, he murdered a church.
[02:34:29.120 --> 02:34:35.120]  And how he did it so dishonorably and sickeningly and treacherously.
[02:34:35.120 --> 02:34:49.120]  And it's done to shock the conscience while the globalists commit all these incredible crimes like arming Al Qaeda and ISIS to kill Christians by the hundreds of thousands, all of the Middle East.
[02:34:49.120 --> 02:34:56.120]  And it's not even in our news. That's what's sick is that it's, they use our conscience.
[02:34:56.120 --> 02:35:10.120]  They use the fact that we have soft hearts, pink hearts, that we love God, that we're bitter clingers, that we don't want to hurt anybody, that we don't hate people.
[02:35:10.120 --> 02:35:18.120]  You know, I run into racists and people, and believe me, you could have black racists, white racists, Hispanic racists, whatever, it's all just tribal stuff.
[02:35:18.120 --> 02:35:26.120]  And they'll think, like, behind the scenes that, hey, you're racist too, you know, make a racist joke, and they're just like, no. And they'll say, but they're racist.
[02:35:26.120 --> 02:35:34.120]  And I'll say, not all of them, and I'm not going to stoop to that level. It's not because I'm on some high horse, either.
[02:35:34.120 --> 02:35:41.120]  This is what controls us is all this tribalism. It's how the British Empire control people. It's how the Romans control people.
[02:35:41.120 --> 02:35:45.120]  We either transcend this, folks, or it's over.
[02:35:45.120 --> 02:35:51.120]  They didn't kill Malcolm X when he was running around calling for violence. When he stopped calling for it is when they killed him.
[02:35:51.120 --> 02:35:56.120]  That's why they killed Martin Luther King, because he had moral authority.
[02:35:56.120 --> 02:36:03.120]  And that's why they made up a bunch of stuff about Martin Luther King from both political sides to confuse the issue.
[02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:13.120]  It's because they don't want us to have a stable world, because in a stable world, it's based on what you produce and what you stand for and how good your word is.
[02:36:13.120 --> 02:36:19.120]  They want it to be on race. They want it to be on who your daddy was. They want it to be, that's what royalty is.
[02:36:19.120 --> 02:36:26.120]  That's what the Clinton family and the Bushes are. It's the same thing.
[02:36:26.120 --> 02:36:30.120]  The problem is they hype, race up enough. You got to watch out when you're in the wrong neighborhood.
[02:36:30.120 --> 02:36:40.120]  And black folks got to watch out when they're in the wrong neighborhood, because even though it's a fraud, it becomes real because they put it out long enough.
[02:36:40.120 --> 02:36:48.120]  And even if you don't want to dislike people, you still got to look out if you're black, if you're white, if you're...
[02:36:48.120 --> 02:36:52.120]  They got us all, women against men, men against women. You can see them.
[02:36:52.120 --> 02:36:56.120]  In fact, I never got to it with Father's Day coming up. I want to play and get children's take on this.
[02:36:56.120 --> 02:37:00.120]  I sent it to you. You guys tried to get me to play it last week. I never got to it or Monday.
[02:37:00.120 --> 02:37:10.120]  It's the paper ad, toilet paper ad, the Angel Soft ad, where it's like, no, we're not going to think dad, mom.
[02:37:10.120 --> 02:37:17.120]  My mom was my dad. Now that everybody's basically single parent, half the country or more, now to just say dads are good.
[02:37:17.120 --> 02:37:24.120]  No, you're not good. There isn't a good dad. Now dad's just existing is bad.
[02:37:24.120 --> 02:37:30.120]  Angel Soft ad, which disparages fathers, gets huge negative backlash.
[02:37:30.120 --> 02:37:34.120]  Well, you take out the father folks, you took out the whole family and they've done it.
[02:37:34.120 --> 02:37:40.120]  We're going into such bondage. In every slave culture, men could not be fathers and they were kept out dumbed down,
[02:37:40.120 --> 02:37:47.120]  whether it was white slaves in Rome or black slaves in the Caribbean or the U.S.
[02:37:47.120 --> 02:37:50.120]  I mean, I'm a historian by just interest.
[02:37:50.120 --> 02:37:58.120]  I've read more history books than most historians. Most historians just specialize on one area.
[02:37:58.120 --> 02:38:05.120]  And I just see him playing this and I don't like being a chump. I don't like being played. I don't like it.
[02:38:05.120 --> 02:38:14.120]  I don't like being a loser. I don't like my kids growing up in a world like this that gets worse, not better.
[02:38:14.120 --> 02:38:20.120]  I'm going to go back to children's because I'm ranting and I invited him on and I'm just, but he's pretty much speechless today too.
[02:38:20.120 --> 02:38:23.120]  He's usually not because I get it. I'm going to see if he agrees with me. There's this weight.
[02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:27.120]  I really feel evil increasing right now and Ron Paul's talked about it.
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:33.120]  So we're going to play a clip of him warning today. It's up on infowars.com that.
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:42.120]  Well, I'll just let you hear it in his own words. I'm not going to belabor this. I'm too freaked out because this shooting is just icing on the cake right now.
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:50.120]  Everything that's going on. I mean, war with the Russians building our government publicly funding Al Qaeda and ISIS.
[02:38:50.120 --> 02:38:59.120]  Robots replacing humans everywhere. All the announcements being made. It's Twilight Zone.
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:04.120]  It's Twilight Zone, but it's really happening.
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:07.120]  But I'm just too exhausted to do some big pitch.
[02:39:07.120 --> 02:39:12.120]  It's amazing. Known concentrated organic herbs in the liver shield. Then for life.com.
[02:39:12.120 --> 02:39:19.120]  Most livers are toxic in this environment, even if you don't drink and you can just take it daily and it helps flush out your liver.
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:22.120]  And it really works too. So don't drink if you're taking it.
[02:39:22.120 --> 02:39:33.120]  I'm just going to tell you right now, because if you drink when you take it, I mean, I was taking it and had one drink and it hurt me.
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:38.120]  So you can take it on a daily basis or you can do the super flush, which I've been doing.
[02:39:38.120 --> 02:39:43.120]  We take the oxy powder and the liver shield and the organic apple cider vinegar.
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:45.120]  And it just flushes everything out.
[02:39:45.120 --> 02:39:50.120]  And on the sixth day, you drink seven ounces of olive oil, lay on your right side.
[02:39:50.120 --> 02:39:56.120]  And it just releases in the morning for most people. Other people takes a few days and the videos on info wars, life.com.
[02:39:56.120 --> 02:40:02.120]  I'm not going to describe it here, but the average person gets about 20, 30 balls the size of marbles that come out of your gallbladder.
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:06.120]  You're not supposed to have any of those. That's why gallbladders are bursting all the time.
[02:40:06.120 --> 02:40:12.120]  It's dramatic what your liver, the toxins it's built up and they're just stored in the gallbladder, basically sits there.
[02:40:12.120 --> 02:40:17.120]  Info wars, life.com. We're selling out of the survival shield, nascent iodine X2, the clean iodine.
[02:40:17.120 --> 02:40:23.120]  Nobody else has got this. It's the missing halogen in the body. All the bad halogens fill up the fire, everything else.
[02:40:23.120 --> 02:40:28.120]  Dramatic results. Talk to your physician. This is not your average vitamin or mineral.
[02:40:28.120 --> 02:40:33.120]  And we've got scores of other great products in full wars, life.com. Your purchase funds this operation.
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:35.120]  And I want to thank you all for your support.
[02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:49.120]  Shoulders, I'm kind of just ranting here because before the shooting happened and all of this, the crescendo of shoes dropping, the buildup, the craziness of the power elite.
[02:40:49.120 --> 02:40:56.120]  My spirit, my gut, whatever you call it's never been wrong. And it is beyond upset beyond having chills.
[02:40:56.120 --> 02:41:03.120]  Now it is just a feeling of not fear. It's more of just, oh, I can't believe it.
[02:41:03.120 --> 02:41:08.120]  It's disbelief at the evil I feel entering the world. Does that make sense?
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:16.120]  Absolutely. I don't want to sound so much like a theologian, but I've been sharing that same message with my church.
[02:41:16.120 --> 02:41:28.120]  It's Isaiah 60, darkness covers the earth, gross darkness, the people, meaning the testimony of creation that there is a God as being hidden darkness covers the earth.
[02:41:28.120 --> 02:41:36.120]  And there's a gross darkness on people that is basically anti God, anti family.
[02:41:36.120 --> 02:41:47.120]  Now that is a great, you know, insight when you see how they're demeaning the first thing God started with when he wanted a family, which was a man.
[02:41:47.120 --> 02:41:56.120]  And they are trying to undermine that if you undermine and of course you also know we're going to have the ruling on same sex marriage very shortly.
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:12.120]  If you can undermine the basic unit of family, you have no society and we will be controlled. We will be like drones because we will look to government for every decision we have to make because they will say we're too.
[02:42:12.120 --> 02:42:22.120]  We're not capable even here in the state of New Jersey and I cannot understand how in the world we do not fight this more, but I got so many fights in me.
[02:42:22.120 --> 02:42:35.120]  We can't even have a referendum. We can't even put a question on the ballot. We the people and our legislator at some time ago decided that there'd be no referendums in New Jersey.
[02:42:35.120 --> 02:42:41.120]  So this is where it's going. Now, what's going to stop that?
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:57.120]  All the time you mentioned Dr. King. Absolutely. He said an injustice to anyone, anywhere is an injustice to everyone, everywhere until we get that mindset that your struggle for justice is my struggle for justice.
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:04.120]  Your desire to be free is my desire to be free, whether we be on the different sides of tracks, different cultures, different race.
[02:43:04.120 --> 02:43:15.120]  That's what will overcome the tyranny. That's what's going to overcome the hearts basically that are determined to control.
[02:43:15.120 --> 02:43:31.120]  This is all about control. The health care plan was not about health care. It was about control because if you can control that much of the economy and control that much of my decision making when it comes to my health, then you control me.
[02:43:31.120 --> 02:43:41.120]  So we're right now at a time where we must resist with everything that we have and you can't fight every battle. Sometimes we may try to.
[02:43:41.120 --> 02:43:51.120]  We have to concentrate on where God is leading us to address, expose the evil and do it in love and unite people and expose the darkness.
[02:43:51.120 --> 02:44:04.120]  You're absolutely right. Since I mentioned it, it's a couple minutes long. I'm going to play this Angel Soft toilet paper ad where they imply because back during Mother's Day, every ad on the Super Bowl, there were six of them we played.
[02:44:04.120 --> 02:44:14.120]  Every ad about Mother's Day said dads weren't needed. Dads were bad. It was really vicious and nasty as if you build women up by putting down dads.
[02:44:14.120 --> 02:44:26.120]  And then now there's all these other anti-dad commercials, not just this one where mom's the dad as if it takes away from women to say there's a day for dads.
[02:44:26.120 --> 02:44:33.120]  It's it's just so obvious that there's nothing on the air that exalts a father.
[02:44:33.120 --> 02:44:49.120]  Look at all the sitcoms. It's only so it's either a woman is either a homosexual. There is no straight man that you could look to to honor as a person of wisdom of stability of fortitude.
[02:44:49.120 --> 02:44:58.120]  But they don't realize there's the days of fathers knows best. The Donna Reed show, leave it to be or all that is gone.
[02:44:58.120 --> 02:45:11.120]  And we have to understand that there is a theme that is being propagated to us that is literally destroying us and making us mindless and with no stability.
[02:45:11.120 --> 02:45:17.120]  And that's the other part that you break down family. You don't have stability. I don't care who's the president.
[02:45:17.120 --> 02:45:23.120]  Well, that was my point is that I can get the arguments. We need more role models of women or I don't hate people over issues.
[02:45:23.120 --> 02:45:31.120]  But they're pushing an agenda because behind it is the fall of civilization and we see the fruit coming out the other end.
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:38.120]  It's bad. It's poison. We know it's an evil plan. We know it's breaking down society. We know it's not good.
[02:45:38.120 --> 02:45:44.120]  In fact, here is this ad which is heartfelt. Of course, moms are great. I watched this ad and think about all those hardworking moms.
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:51.120]  But this is fathers day. See, you can't have a father. That's what they're saying. The father itself is bad.
[02:45:51.120 --> 02:46:00.120]  And I think about all the things my dad did, how great my grandfathers were, how good they were to everybody and how we loved each other as families.
[02:46:00.120 --> 02:46:10.120]  And then nowadays, so many women I run into, they think a man being strong or a man being successful somehow diminishes them.
[02:46:10.120 --> 02:46:16.120]  It's so sick. Don't they get the government wants them alone? Women figure this out by about 40.
[02:46:16.120 --> 02:46:25.120]  But I tell you, they have really done a job. Let's go to this disgusting angel soft ad. They're airing all over the country right now and there's a big backlash to it.
[02:46:25.120 --> 02:46:35.120]  My father passed away when I was three. There was four of us kids within five years. So my mom had to raise four kids by herself.
[02:46:35.120 --> 02:46:49.120]  My mom was a single mother. So she raised both of us completely by herself.
[02:46:49.120 --> 02:46:54.120]  This is on fathers day though, remember? I'm sorry. Again, to get in the middle of it, to act like...
[02:46:54.120 --> 02:46:59.120]  I don't know how she raised three boys on her own with such grace.
[02:46:59.120 --> 02:47:08.120]  I've definitely seen her try to juggle both mom, dad and everything else that she had to be for herself.
[02:47:08.120 --> 02:47:12.120]  She did all of it and she did it all as though she was two people.
[02:47:12.120 --> 02:47:16.120]  Pushed by the agenda to get dads out. She was not a joke.
[02:47:16.120 --> 02:47:18.120]  Then they made her a victim.
[02:47:18.120 --> 02:47:21.120]  Our car broke down. Oh, well, that's the alternator.
[02:47:21.120 --> 02:47:28.120]  She was like, you put your knuckle out and you just go for it. I mean, I don't even know if that's a thing.
[02:47:28.120 --> 02:47:35.120]  Even like, opposite of her toughness, it was something very fragile, you know?
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:43.120]  Anything that needs help, a person, a thing, an animal, she will find it and she will nurse it back to health.
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:49.120]  Notice all these men have imprinted on their mothers only, not on a father, so they're very effeminate.
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:55.120]  And again, that's so they don't know how to fight, don't know how to stand up. It's the nanny state, phasing humans out.
[02:47:55.120 --> 02:48:01.120]  And then they take it very aggressive that a man, if somebody else has a dad, that's bad, you understand?
[02:48:01.120 --> 02:48:07.120]  Because misery loves company. Any time I promote a two-parent home, statistically much better, people go,
[02:48:07.120 --> 02:48:10.120]  why are you against single parents? I'm not. A lot of them do a great job.
[02:48:10.120 --> 02:48:15.120]  There's an agenda to break us up. That's the point. Let's go back to it.
[02:48:15.120 --> 02:48:17.120]  That's my mom.
[02:48:17.120 --> 02:48:24.120]  Always very effeminate, very hugging and kissing and all of that. It was always nothing but love.
[02:48:24.120 --> 02:48:29.120]  Some days she had to be softer. Some days she had to be stronger.
[02:48:29.120 --> 02:48:35.120]  She really is like the most amazing mother, but she was really an incredible father. Truly incredible.
[02:48:35.120 --> 02:48:40.120]  So seeing a father's day has to be a mother's day too, but every day she had to be both.
[02:48:40.120 --> 02:48:45.120]  Mom, I hope you have a beautiful day.
[02:48:45.120 --> 02:48:47.120]  This is your father's day.
[02:48:47.120 --> 02:48:53.120]  I love you from the bottom of my heart and I'm thankful for everything you've done for me.
[02:48:53.120 --> 02:48:55.120]  She's done scientifically. These people don't know what they think of us.
[02:48:55.120 --> 02:48:57.120]  Happy Father's Day, Mom.
[02:48:57.120 --> 02:48:58.120]  Happy Father's Day.
[02:48:58.120 --> 02:49:00.120]  Mama, Felicia del padre.
[02:49:00.120 --> 02:49:02.120]  Hi, Mom.
[02:49:02.120 --> 02:49:04.120]  Happy Father's Day.
[02:49:04.120 --> 02:49:05.120]  Very subversive.
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:07.120]  Happy Father's Day, Mama.
[02:49:07.120 --> 02:49:10.120]  Happy Father's Day, Mom.
[02:49:10.120 --> 02:49:11.120]  No, Mom.
[02:49:11.120 --> 02:49:12.120]  But they'll know.
[02:49:12.120 --> 02:49:13.120]  Happy Father's Day.
[02:49:13.120 --> 02:49:20.120]  The big globalist company that women buy 83% of household items and almost 90% of paper guts.
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:25.120]  So it's a cold-blooded leftist agenda that wants to exterminate the babies,
[02:49:25.120 --> 02:49:28.120]  but notice it's incredibly unpopular, but they don't care.
[02:49:28.120 --> 02:49:32.120]  With the target audience, it'll make them buy more toilet paper.
[02:49:32.120 --> 02:49:34.120]  Reverend Childress, what do you think of that?
[02:49:34.120 --> 02:49:37.120]  That was sick. That was really sick.
[02:49:37.120 --> 02:49:43.120]  I, you know, well, I'm glad that the dislikes, that's the encouraging part of it,
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:50.120]  but the fact of the matter is, there is a Mother's Day where you can say all those nice things.
[02:49:50.120 --> 02:49:55.120]  I mean, it is purposefully and systemically attacked on the fathers.
[02:49:55.120 --> 02:49:59.120]  My goodness, and you're saying for profit, well, then I can understand it.
[02:49:59.120 --> 02:50:02.120]  But every TV show, though, the father is a slob.
[02:50:02.120 --> 02:50:05.120]  Funny, the men I saw weren't like that.
[02:50:05.120 --> 02:50:07.120]  That's right. You're absolutely right.
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:09.120]  And I'm faking God for it every day.
[02:50:09.120 --> 02:50:12.120]  You have to pick out your children's programs today.
[02:50:12.120 --> 02:50:17.120]  Parents, I'm telling you, you have to pick them out.
[02:50:17.120 --> 02:50:19.120]  Yes to this, no to that.
[02:50:19.120 --> 02:50:25.120]  My son-in-law came to me almost with tears talking about a cartoon
[02:50:25.120 --> 02:50:28.120]  that was infemininizing his son.
[02:50:28.120 --> 02:50:31.120]  He said, this is promoting homosexuality.
[02:50:31.120 --> 02:50:33.120]  You don't think I can see that?
[02:50:33.120 --> 02:50:36.120]  And he was disturbed, but it's a cartoon.
[02:50:36.120 --> 02:50:38.120]  So you got to understand, I didn't grow up with that.
[02:50:38.120 --> 02:50:44.120]  You grew up with that, but certainly it is very much a part of our society.
[02:50:44.120 --> 02:50:48.120]  And that's when it becomes intimidating and overwhelming.
[02:50:48.120 --> 02:50:51.120]  Well, that's the issue is I'll be quite frank with you.
[02:50:51.120 --> 02:50:52.120]  It makes me more reactionary.
[02:50:52.120 --> 02:50:57.120]  I've been pretty culturally liberal in many ways that I'm not obsessing over what people are doing.
[02:50:57.120 --> 02:51:01.120]  But at a certain point I get, wait a minute, they're obsessing over me.
[02:51:01.120 --> 02:51:06.120]  They're saying I can't go on being the way I am and I can't have my family.
[02:51:06.120 --> 02:51:10.120]  And everywhere they're trying to target my kids with stuff that's very subversive.
[02:51:10.120 --> 02:51:12.120]  I mean, it's stuff for five-year-olds.
[02:51:12.120 --> 02:51:19.120]  Nickelodeon admitted four years ago that they were going to target four, five, and six-year-olds with a quote, you know, pro-gay agenda.
[02:51:19.120 --> 02:51:22.120]  Well, that's what is sexualizing five-year-olds.
[02:51:22.120 --> 02:51:24.120]  They're doing a great job at it too.
[02:51:24.120 --> 02:51:31.120]  And basically going unimpeded without protest, without anyone saying enough's enough.
[02:51:31.120 --> 02:51:33.120]  Same thing with Disneyland.
[02:51:33.120 --> 02:51:38.120]  You really, parents, unfortunately, this is the hour we're in, have to take a stand.
[02:51:38.120 --> 02:51:40.120]  And it is about profit for many of them.
[02:51:40.120 --> 02:51:43.120]  And if you hit them in their pocket, they will withdraw.
[02:51:43.120 --> 02:51:47.120]  It's just like with Doug Dynasty when he made his comments.
[02:51:47.120 --> 02:51:51.120]  But then they looked at the checkbook and said, you know something, we're going to let this go.
[02:51:51.120 --> 02:52:02.120]  So we have to recognize we do still have buying power and you can boycott these things effectively if you choose to do it, generically, everybody.
[02:52:02.120 --> 02:52:14.120]  And I wanted to say to the audience also, this is the same issue with family that happened when our leadership, African-American leadership said in the 60s,
[02:52:14.120 --> 02:52:18.120]  well, now we're going to get a piece of the pie, whatever that meant.
[02:52:18.120 --> 02:52:25.120]  My mother and father didn't get a piece of the pie in that sense, but they had these great government programs, welfare programs.
[02:52:25.120 --> 02:52:34.120]  Well, I'm sure you remember part of that was the father could not be in the home in order for you to get these subsidies.
[02:52:34.120 --> 02:52:36.120]  The male cannot be there.
[02:52:36.120 --> 02:52:39.120]  Now it's going nationalists.
[02:52:39.120 --> 02:52:41.120]  This same mentality.
[02:52:41.120 --> 02:52:43.120]  They say you don't need a man.
[02:52:43.120 --> 02:52:48.120]  I mean, imagine saying to ducks, you don't need a male mate or to Eagles.
[02:52:48.120 --> 02:52:52.120]  I mean, it's just an attack on the species like space aliens are running it or something.
[02:52:52.120 --> 02:52:55.120]  And we're like, look, the family's falling apart.
[02:52:55.120 --> 02:53:00.120]  We're stuff disintegrating and it's just like body snatchers or something.
[02:53:00.120 --> 02:53:02.120]  They go, you will be assimilated.
[02:53:02.120 --> 02:53:12.120]  Folks need to know that the Americas be destabilized and they can do something about it and they can't be intimidated about it.
[02:53:12.120 --> 02:53:21.120]  You can get frustrated about it like I do sometimes, but you have to have an agenda of your own and be strong and be faithful about your endeavor and don't look back.
[02:53:21.120 --> 02:53:23.120]  And that's what I found.
[02:53:23.120 --> 02:53:28.120]  If you tell children about the agenda and then they see it in their real life, then they don't rebel against you.
[02:53:28.120 --> 02:53:30.120]  They stand up against the system.
[02:53:30.120 --> 02:53:32.120]  People say, oh, the kids are all rebelling.
[02:53:32.120 --> 02:53:40.120]  Well, that's if you haven't laid out how the world works, then they they're prime genetically to listen to their parents, especially their father.
[02:53:40.120 --> 02:53:42.120]  And that's why they don't want fathers there.
[02:53:42.120 --> 02:53:47.120]  So the fathers can sit around the campfire and tell the little Braves what's coming up in the future.
[02:53:47.120 --> 02:53:53.120]  And then they go out and see it works, they respect their fathers and not just their dad, but the other men in the tribe.
[02:53:53.120 --> 02:53:55.120]  And then that's how you have a strong tribe.
[02:53:55.120 --> 02:53:57.120]  You remove the men of the tribe, the tribe dies.
[02:53:57.120 --> 02:54:00.120]  How come the LBGT knows this?
[02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:02.120]  Planned Parenthood knows this.
[02:54:02.120 --> 02:54:06.120]  Everybody that's our enemies knows they have to get to our children.
[02:54:06.120 --> 02:54:15.120]  And it appears that we don't offer enough defense for our children to guard them against the lies, guard them against this intrusion.
[02:54:15.120 --> 02:54:26.120]  And when you have the president of the United States pushing this this filth, basically, or this this sexualization of our children,
[02:54:26.120 --> 02:54:35.120]  even down the kindergarten by these health programs or these health studies in our school, it is time for us to stand up.
[02:54:35.120 --> 02:54:38.120]  There has to be a degree of revolt.
[02:54:38.120 --> 02:54:39.120]  That's what I was going to ask.
[02:54:39.120 --> 02:54:40.120]  What is the bottom?
[02:54:40.120 --> 02:54:41.120]  How much are we going to put up with?
[02:54:41.120 --> 02:54:49.120]  I mean, they know we won't put up with forever, so they want to have the revolution just be a big race war instead of people coming together and vomiting out this sick culture.
[02:54:49.120 --> 02:54:50.120]  They're force feeding us.
[02:54:50.120 --> 02:54:53.120]  Yeah, well, it's coming to a head now.
[02:54:53.120 --> 02:55:03.120]  Alex, I really, it's, you know, civil disobedience is fine when you're trying to really show forth your effort.
[02:55:03.120 --> 02:55:05.120]  I believe it to be peaceful.
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:07.120]  Martin said, do it in peace.
[02:55:07.120 --> 02:55:10.120]  And I believe he showed the world that they could be done that way.
[02:55:10.120 --> 02:55:15.120]  But we we need to say no, we're not going to allow our kids to go to those schools that are teaching this.
[02:55:15.120 --> 02:55:22.120]  No, we're not going to permit this intrusion in our own businesses when it comes to our faith in our religion.
[02:55:22.120 --> 02:55:28.120]  Just know and they can't handle that type of revolt.
[02:55:28.120 --> 02:55:39.120]  And I believe when one day, especially the African American community, especially will stop bowing down to the politicians who mean them absolutely no good.
[02:55:39.120 --> 02:55:50.120]  At all, and really recognize that they have stripped them of their faith, stripped them of their belief, stripped them of their morality, then there will be a shift then.
[02:55:50.120 --> 02:55:52.120]  There will be a shift then.
[02:55:52.120 --> 02:55:57.120]  I think it is once again, the church is the key we meet every Sunday.
[02:55:57.120 --> 02:55:59.120]  It could gradually be done and changed.
[02:55:59.120 --> 02:56:01.120]  The information has to get in.
[02:56:01.120 --> 02:56:12.120]  We can't just come in with sermons that are religious, but we have to come in with a word based from the scriptures to bring about change in our politics all interconnected.
[02:56:12.120 --> 02:56:16.120]  And that's what founded this country was the was the pastors saying no to the tyranny.
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:22.120]  In closing, even monitoring media, obviously, as I have, they're going with the anti gun agenda.
[02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:30.120]  But do you think cooler heads prevail and we're not going to put up with hyping a race war like the media has been trying to do so far?
[02:56:30.120 --> 02:56:32.120]  How bad does it look?
[02:56:32.120 --> 02:56:35.120]  So, you know, I can't tell right now.
[02:56:35.120 --> 02:56:38.120]  I'm going to wait till after this weekend.
[02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:45.120]  As I stated, there's going to be some militant speakers that I don't know what they're going to do with this right now.
[02:56:45.120 --> 02:56:47.120]  You'll know Monday.
[02:56:47.120 --> 02:56:50.120]  I'll get a better feel for Monday or Tuesday.
[02:56:50.120 --> 02:56:55.120]  And I think once again, the timing on this was impeccable.
[02:56:55.120 --> 02:57:07.120]  And so now you you've given talking points to some of the most militant rebellious individuals, especially in the African American community, who would really some of them would want to race for.
[02:57:07.120 --> 02:57:12.120]  They want this this anarchy insanity to continue.
[02:57:12.120 --> 02:57:22.120]  So I'll know better after this weekend and prayerfully the people of Charleston respond carefully and we'll see.
[02:57:22.120 --> 02:57:25.120]  We'll see. I can't tell right now.
[02:57:25.120 --> 02:57:27.120]  Blackgenocide.org Reverend Leonard Childress God bless you.
[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:30.120]  Hopefully you can pop in with us at least 30 minutes sometime next week with an update.
[02:57:30.120 --> 02:57:32.120]  Have a great weekend, sir.
[02:57:32.120 --> 02:57:33.120]  Appreciate it. God bless now.
[02:57:33.120 --> 02:57:34.120]  God bless you.
[02:57:34.120 --> 02:57:35.120]  I tell you folks.
[02:57:35.120 --> 02:57:40.120]  And again, it's not that I hate anybody for who they are or what they're I'm very open minded classical liberal.
[02:57:40.120 --> 02:57:42.120]  But there is an agenda.
[02:57:42.120 --> 02:57:44.120]  Just look at it.
[02:57:44.120 --> 02:57:46.120]  It's not good.
[02:57:46.120 --> 02:57:50.120]  Everything attached to it is to bring down humanity.
[02:57:50.120 --> 02:57:53.120]  If I was going to take down any group, I'd go in and take the men out.
[02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:55.120]  That's what every enslaving group did.
[02:57:55.120 --> 02:57:57.120]  I mean, it is one on one takeover.
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:57:59.120]  I don't mean to do this every day.
[02:57:59.120 --> 02:58:00.120]  I got to do some overdrive.
[02:58:00.120 --> 02:58:07.120]  It's a breaking news and info wars dot com and prison planet dot com China to retrofit thousands of merchant ships for war.
[02:58:07.120 --> 02:58:08.120]  That's what I mean.
[02:58:08.120 --> 02:58:13.120]  I mean, it's like top historians are saying this is like pre-World War One, pre-World War Two.
[02:58:13.120 --> 02:58:21.120]  I mean, everybody who's smart is saying, man, the elite have decided to just do some crazy stuff all the back Sunday.
[02:58:21.120 --> 02:58:22.120]  Four to six p.m.
[02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:24.120]  Okay, Lord willing, pray for us.
[02:58:24.120 --> 02:58:25.120]  Four to six p.m. of the Sunday show.
[02:58:25.120 --> 02:58:26.120]  Tell friends and family.
[02:58:26.120 --> 02:58:30.120]  Live dot com today.
[02:58:30.120 --> 02:58:39.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, you haven't really ever heard firearms manufacturers and sponsors on my syndicated radio show or the nightly news or the news website info wars dot com.
[02:58:39.120 --> 02:58:46.120]  Because the companies I've been approached by were not the highest quality and they weren't as affordable as they should be.
[02:58:46.120 --> 02:58:47.120]  So I refused.
[02:58:47.120 --> 02:58:55.120]  Probably 30, 40 firearms manufacturers over the years will then about six months ago, we get contacted by head down firearms.
[02:58:55.120 --> 02:59:05.120]  HB firearms dot com own and run by a bunch of former Navy SEALs, special ops people, their veterans, their patriots, their listeners of the radio show, and they want to support the broadcast.

[02:59:33.120 --> 02:59:43.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:59:43.120 --> 02:59:50.120]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:59:50.120 --> 02:59:54.120]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:59:54.120 --> 02:59:59.120]  By the way, I forgot to play this wrong ball clip so I'll play it now then I'll hit this merchant story.
[02:59:59.120 --> 03:00:11.120]  Shining a retrofit thousands of merchant ships for war, here he is that clip, ominous clip, the full video is up on infowars.com with former Congressman Ron Paul talking about the day of reckoning.
[03:00:11.120 --> 03:00:21.120]  You don't know the timeline on this, it could be tomorrow, it could be a month, it could be a couple years from now, because it all depends on a psychological acceptance of the system.
[03:00:21.120 --> 03:00:33.120]  So a lot of people who are still making a lot of money know the system is not going to last, but they figure well if everybody else thinks it's going to last they just keep owning bonds and buying stocks.
[03:00:33.120 --> 03:00:38.120]  Today they're buying stocks and yet next week they may sell them all again.
[03:00:38.120 --> 03:00:54.120]  So I don't think there's any way to know what the time is, but you know after 35 years of a gigantic bull market in bonds believe me they cannot reverse history and you cannot print money forever and deceive the markets forever.
[03:00:54.120 --> 03:01:05.120]  Eventually the markets will rule and that's only a question of when that will happen and of course I run a little bit scared because I think there will be a day of reckoning.
[03:01:05.120 --> 03:01:10.120]  Powerful transmission, bullvideoinfowars.com.
[03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:18.120]  China to retrofit thousands of merchant ships for war, Beijing launches huge program as tensions with US build.
[03:01:18.120 --> 03:01:29.120]  China is set to retrofit thousands of merchant ships for military purposes so they can be using the event of war and other disturbing indication of growing tensions between Beijing and Washington.
[03:01:29.120 --> 03:01:37.120]  The shipping industry publication trade winds reveals that China is repairing a new fleet of war-ready ships to serve as a reserve military logistics wing.
[03:01:37.120 --> 03:01:41.120]  That's just their regular ships so they're covert in the event of a naval conflict.
[03:01:41.120 --> 03:01:56.120]  The new policy will apply to container ships, row-rows, multi-purpose ships, bulkers and other ships with shipbuilders receiving a government subsidy to pay for the cost of making the vessels military useful.
[03:01:56.120 --> 03:02:07.120]  And now they're announcing here in the United States they're putting cruise missile, anti-cruise missile batteries on the east and west coast to shoot down submarine launch cruise missiles.
[03:02:07.120 --> 03:02:16.120]  I mean, regardless it's a giant boondog ripping us off but it looks really ominous with the whole Russian situation and the rest of it.
[03:02:16.120 --> 03:02:25.120]  According to American Maritime Congress President James Capote, the move is another sign of Beijing intensifying its military buildup while Washington stands idly by.
[03:02:25.120 --> 03:02:32.120]  We really want China to do that much more capable, he asked, explaining the decision to retrofit merchant ships' military technology.
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:46.120]  People's Liberation Army researcher Chao Lin Dong said modern naval warfare often requires the mobilization deployment of a larger number of ships while the mass production of naval ships in peacetime is not economically sensible.
[03:02:46.120 --> 03:02:53.120]  That's what England and the U.S. both did in World War I and World War II and in a bunch of other conflicts.
[03:02:53.120 --> 03:03:06.120]  And what it is is just covert where you can have missiles with this technology so compact where a missile pod pops up out of what looks like boxes where it's got better loading docks for equipment, troops, larger supply.
[03:03:06.120 --> 03:03:17.120]  I mean, there's all sorts of hidden guns, gun pods, different radar systems, and then you just have the companies do it and then you pay them back.
[03:03:17.120 --> 03:03:24.120]  I mean, there's hundreds of things they're doing and they've got all these ports everywhere. They've got Long Beach, all the other deep water parts. It's crazy.
[03:03:24.120 --> 03:03:32.120]  Panama Canal and we're being set up, as Joe Scousen said, for a conflict to entice Russia and China to strike.
[03:03:32.120 --> 03:03:39.120]  They're just pushing them and pushing them while the elite creep over and stand right next to their bunkers waiting for whatever this is.
[03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:44.120]  I mean, we're in the hands of suicidal nutcases.
[03:03:44.120 --> 03:03:48.120]  That's all I can say.
[03:03:48.120 --> 03:03:51.120]  I mean, just look at the news. There's just hundreds of these hundreds of them.
[03:03:51.120 --> 03:03:55.120]  School lunch program scans students' thumb prints for tracking purposes.
[03:03:55.120 --> 03:03:57.120]  Notice the condition to do that to buy and sell.
[03:03:57.120 --> 03:04:04.120]  Brian Williams gets $10 million for his new job at MSNBC.
[03:04:04.120 --> 03:04:06.120]  He'll fit in really well with that scum.
[03:04:06.120 --> 03:04:14.120]  I mean, they are just scum, lying. Let's go out with Melissa Harris-Perry saying that your kids belong to them.
[03:04:14.120 --> 03:04:17.120]  And just remember that, because they know best.
[03:04:17.120 --> 03:04:23.120]  Your kids belong to this White House operative, this creepy woman, and I'll see you back, Lord Willing, on Sunday 4 to 6 p.m.
[03:04:23.120 --> 03:04:24.120]  Great job, Crude.
[03:04:24.120 --> 03:04:28.120]  We haven't had a very collective notion of these are our children.
[03:04:28.120 --> 03:04:34.120]  So part of it is we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents or kids belong to their families
[03:04:34.120 --> 03:04:36.120]  and recognize that kids belong to whole communities.
[03:04:36.120 --> 03:05:04.120]  Once it's everybody's responsibility and not just the households, then we start making better investments.
