[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:33.080]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones John Draper the undisputed father
[00:33.080 --> 00:39.760]  of hacking is going to be joining us to talk about why hacking is important in the state of the
[00:39.760 --> 00:44.640]  world so that's some pretty important things to say of course I'm not about who this guy is for
[00:44.640 --> 00:49.760]  25 years I'm not even a techie so we're honored that he reached out to us and wants to come on
[00:49.760 --> 00:54.920]  the show and as a listener so we'll be hearing from him his take on Snowden you name it he's
[00:54.920 --> 00:59.360]  the original guy hacking into telephones and teaching people how to do it and not so much to
[00:59.360 --> 01:05.840]  listen to people but how to use the telephone networks for free so that is coming up in the
[01:05.840 --> 01:11.960]  second hour we are going to have open phones in the first second and third hour obviously in
[01:11.960 --> 01:16.480]  the second hour for our guests who wants to take calls we're gonna cover a lot of news that I
[01:16.480 --> 01:20.880]  haven't gotten to the last few days I was digging through the stacks it's really super important
[01:20.880 --> 01:28.320]  but also all the latest breaking news and information I want to focus some on the bid the
[01:28.320 --> 01:35.040]  the huge mid-term elections the big elections that are coming up next week we're going to have
[01:35.040 --> 01:41.280]  probably a seven eight hour marathon transmission on info wars nightly news next week info wars
[01:41.280 --> 01:47.680]  nightly news is going to run from six o'clock probably up till midnight or past that not so much
[01:47.680 --> 01:52.480]  even covering the results though we'll be doing that but looking at the propaganda watching for
[01:52.480 --> 01:57.520]  election fraud airing a lot of special reports that are being produced right now and interviewing
[01:57.520 --> 02:04.480]  some guests live so and of course I'll be hosting much of that with the rest of the reporters and
[02:04.480 --> 02:10.240]  some of our investigative journalists and special guests next week we're going to have some expanded
[02:10.240 --> 02:16.320]  nightly news transmissions later this week into Monday ahead of the big mid-term elections
[02:19.600 --> 02:25.200]  where to begin when we come back from break there's some articles here that really illustrate
[02:25.200 --> 02:32.080]  where we are in the United States versus the rest of the world Australia has issued a blanket
[02:32.080 --> 02:39.760]  visa ban on Ebola hit countries so they've issued a visa ban that's how you stop people
[02:41.360 --> 02:47.120]  from coming in hey you aren't a citizen you live in one of these countries ravaged by Ebola with
[02:47.120 --> 02:52.000]  the UN saying there could be up to 1.4 million cases by the end of the year you're not going to run
[02:52.000 --> 02:57.280]  here that's just a default common sense thing to do france has done in england's done a bunch of
[02:57.280 --> 03:02.560]  the arab countries have done the african countries have done it but the united states can't do it
[03:02.560 --> 03:10.800]  now that story with this report that i saw two weeks ago on drudge two weeks ago i think was
[03:10.800 --> 03:16.560]  the washington beacon on drudge i saw this two weeks ago on drudge here it is fox news
[03:17.120 --> 03:21.520]  lawmaker claims plans may be in pipeline no i've heard the democrats talk about it
[03:21.520 --> 03:28.400]  to bring non-citizens of the u.s for Ebola treatment see they've got an overthrow common sense and
[03:28.400 --> 03:34.080]  just flaunt everything on our face and send the message out there that you want to come have
[03:34.080 --> 03:38.800]  your baby for free you got a bunch of felonies you want to come here and kill two cops come on
[03:38.800 --> 03:43.760]  you want to rape and kill come on you want to be above the law come here this is the happy
[03:43.760 --> 03:48.160]  hunting ground with a bunch of dumb sheep come join the globalists and overthrow in the country
[03:48.160 --> 03:54.720]  why house pushes back on state Ebola quarantines continuing to say don't you dare hold anybody
[03:54.720 --> 03:59.920]  that shows signs of Ebola you let them go but then cases that look like they are Ebola are
[03:59.920 --> 04:06.000]  being disappeared see it's very complex what's going on the daily mail's reporting what we've
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.680]  been reporting for years Ebola can survive on surfaces for almost two months tests reveal
[04:11.680 --> 04:17.360]  certain strains survive for weeks when stored at low temperatures that's the bad news is this is
[04:17.360 --> 04:22.560]  happening as the winner comes the army's own report from several years ago says there's a test show
[04:23.120 --> 04:33.040]  it is airborne i'm going to say that again in below 45 degrees like a vampire and if it gets in
[04:33.040 --> 04:46.960]  bright direct sunlight it's vaporized but the sun is sinking the earth's tilt is away and so the
[04:46.960 --> 04:54.240]  long dark winter is approaching as our borders and our airports are wide open and obama is
[04:54.240 --> 05:02.480]  advertising that america's a giant Ebola trash can when you're out on the road the last place you
[05:02.480 --> 05:10.400]  want to be is on the road but if the unfortunate happens you'll be glad you were wearing diamond

[08:13.360 --> 08:16.800]  it's the time of the season
[08:18.720 --> 08:27.280]  tuesday the 28th day of october 2014
[08:29.760 --> 08:36.160]  we are here live money through friday from 11 a.m to 2 p.m central standard time
[08:37.040 --> 08:41.520]  and then we return weeknight seven o'clock central info wars nightly news i am your host
[08:41.520 --> 08:48.960]  alex jones we have the father of hacking joining us in the second hour to talk about
[08:48.960 --> 08:55.440]  all the latest snowden revelations and more by the way i've always said that snowden is a clearing
[08:55.440 --> 09:02.000]  house for wiki leaks with a whole bunch of leakers and then he basically just takes the blame
[09:02.000 --> 09:08.000]  there's no way one contractor the way that stuff's compartmentalized is getting all this data just
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  like bradley manning was a cutout and i'm not sure exactly for what group or agency i'm not saying
[09:14.000 --> 09:21.360]  snowden's bad a white hat group in government i'm not sure but they're using them as clearing houses
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.480]  to get the intel out and the fbi's now rated someone's uh an nsa person's house saying they
[09:28.480 --> 09:33.040]  believe that this is one of the people that was actually putting stuff out in snowden's name
[09:33.040 --> 09:41.120]  so that's the bottom line on that front but also by having these limited leakers that don't release
[09:41.120 --> 09:47.920]  everything they've got it does put them under suspicion of blackmail i'm not saying snowden's
[09:47.920 --> 09:53.120]  blackmailing people he's more of a figurehead and all this but you look at some of the organizations
[09:53.120 --> 09:59.600]  involved the democratic party soros is involved behind the scenes and some of it uh it's selective
[09:59.600 --> 10:05.840]  leaking clearly and then snowden says he has info that will bring down the u.s government
[10:06.640 --> 10:12.880]  well what is the u.s government to snowden is it the republic is it the democrats is it the
[10:12.880 --> 10:18.720]  republicans is it certain groups i like the line in captain america
[10:21.440 --> 10:27.040]  where he says we're going to release everything all of hydra secrets and the director who's really
[10:27.040 --> 10:31.520]  the head of hydra goes the director of shield goes you're gonna release all the shield secrets too
[10:33.200 --> 10:40.640]  the only way to release this stuff is all of it selective releasing is very destructive
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.080]  to freedom when you look at it long term because it's only being used to burn certain groups
[10:48.080 --> 10:58.000]  and it's only being selectively released to create an illusion a delusion versus the reality so that's
[10:58.000 --> 11:03.760]  why i think more leaking is the way to go people have to decide what they're going to leak obviously
[11:03.760 --> 11:09.040]  if it's a police investigation of serious organized crime and it looks like the police aren't
[11:09.040 --> 11:13.280]  violating the constitution bill of rights then why would you want to leak something classified
[11:13.280 --> 11:18.640]  but if government say is covering up for dinecore or haliburton running white slavery rings which
[11:18.640 --> 11:24.000]  they've been caught doing over and over again then leak it which people did leak it back
[11:24.000 --> 11:29.280]  in 2004 2005 so it was in the chicago tribune it was even in the new york times people set
[11:29.280 --> 11:34.480]  their reading articles about 10 000 little girls loaded on different defense contractor
[11:34.480 --> 11:40.160]  aircraft and being disappeared yes that needs to be leaked people need to be arrested and executed
[11:40.160 --> 11:46.080]  as well of course that wasn't done because stuff like this is so horrible they can't ever allow
[11:46.080 --> 11:50.320]  a prosecution because then that would take everybody down the rabbit hole into what kind
[11:50.320 --> 11:54.800]  of system is this where you got trillions of narcotics being flown around every year 500
[11:54.800 --> 11:59.600]  billion in the us alone you got giant child kidnapping rings run by shadowy groups that
[11:59.600 --> 12:06.160]  sit inside government like russian dolls it is not the government or major corporations per se
[12:06.160 --> 12:14.160]  that are evil it is the compartmentalization the complexity and the managerial groups that are
[12:14.160 --> 12:21.520]  part of this global interlocking corporate directorship of mafias that won't stop any other
[12:21.520 --> 12:29.200]  form of corruption that is in with their network and they'll only use law enforcement selectively
[12:29.200 --> 12:35.040]  to shut down stuff that isn't part of their network or is part of their network at a low
[12:35.040 --> 12:40.000]  level but it's almost like a layoff program for the low-level criminals to put them into
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.640]  the criminal justice system to make sure they're slaves and don't have any credibility in the
[12:44.640 --> 12:51.920]  system to ever report on corruption above them i've studied the system very very closely and
[12:51.920 --> 12:59.760]  it's a free market of evil why does it work so well because it's a competition in corruption
[12:59.760 --> 13:06.880]  in evil and cunning and manipulation and they've developed over time systems of fraud to burn the
[13:06.880 --> 13:15.600]  underlings and to build giant prison grids and to corrupt the rest of society all the time posing
[13:15.600 --> 13:27.120]  as the defenders and the saviors that are fighting the crime wave it is a fact nationwide
[13:27.120 --> 13:33.200]  it's a major news item that police departments nationwide are releasing hundreds of thousands
[13:33.200 --> 13:38.640]  every few months of illegals that have huge felony records and four five six seven eight
[13:38.640 --> 13:44.320]  nine ten are more identities and they call the feds and say please come pick them up and the
[13:44.320 --> 13:51.840]  feds say no release them just type in the headline police departments or or jails releasing felony
[13:51.840 --> 13:59.280]  illegals and they're above the law just like the illegal that shot two cops dead last week
[14:00.400 --> 14:07.600]  in northern california just shot them dead in the hammer and this guy had been arrested for drug
[14:07.600 --> 14:16.000]  dealing for assault been deported repeatedly and he's gunned down two cops and think about this
[14:16.000 --> 14:22.720]  and think about this if a county or city even calls the feds now because there's a computer record
[14:22.720 --> 14:33.200]  of it then the democratic party lines up and goes in and tries to unseat the sheriff or the mayor
[14:33.200 --> 14:37.440]  or the county commissioners even when they're democrats and the democrats in local areas
[14:39.040 --> 14:44.160]  are saying wait a minute i mean this guy's a rapist or this person's an arsonist this
[14:44.160 --> 14:48.560]  this person killed a bunch of people in mexico and now here and they'll say we don't care release them
[14:49.360 --> 14:58.560]  and if you don't we're going to have you thrown out of office that's a mafia power a hardcore power
[14:58.560 --> 15:04.960]  that's hard to deal with it's over the top just like they're now announcing that obama does intend
[15:05.840 --> 15:11.120]  to bring massive Ebola patients into the united states for treatment here and obvious exposure
[15:11.120 --> 15:15.520]  and spreading it people say that makes no sense it's a campaign killer he doesn't care he's a lame
[15:15.520 --> 15:20.400]  duck it's about bringing the country down meanwhile australia has now joined many european countries
[15:20.400 --> 15:26.240]  many arab countries middle eastern countries and every other african country australia issues
[15:26.240 --> 15:33.920]  blanket visa ban on obola hit countries roiders sydney australia came under fire oh under fire
[15:33.920 --> 15:41.360]  here oh my goodness tuesday for health experts and rights advocates after it issued a blanket
[15:41.360 --> 15:47.040]  ban on visas from west african nations affected by obola outbreak making it the first rich nation
[15:47.040 --> 15:52.320]  to shut its doors to the region uh that's not true they've been banning flights and visas and not
[15:52.320 --> 15:57.600]  issuing the visas so see this is how roiders goes and they close the hatch on the submarine
[15:57.600 --> 16:02.080]  before they submerged or they saw their neighbor's house on fire and they call the fire department
[16:02.080 --> 16:06.800]  oh they're so discredited ted cruz said obama care would raise your premiums and had death panels
[16:06.800 --> 16:11.840]  he's been proven totally right he's so discredited alex jones predicted airborne Ebola and rolling
[16:11.840 --> 16:21.040]  stone in 2011 he's a cook alex jones said two plus two people four isn't that funny see it's
[16:21.040 --> 16:26.080]  this mind game they play were oh my gosh australia isn't going to let people in out of these five
[16:26.080 --> 16:37.200]  countries they're banning visas from them meanwhile fox news reports lawmaker claims plans may be in
[16:37.200 --> 16:42.000]  the pipeline to bring non-citizens to the us for Ebola treatment a top republican congressman
[16:42.000 --> 16:47.360]  claims the obama administration is exploring plans to bring non-us citizens infected with Ebola
[16:47.360 --> 16:54.160]  to the united states for treatment representative bob bob goodlock republican virginia chairman of
[16:54.160 --> 16:58.800]  the house judiciary committee told fox news that his office had received information from
[16:58.800 --> 17:02.960]  within the administration close quote that these plans are being developed so far only
[17:02.960 --> 17:06.800]  american Ebola patients have been brought back and the past you didn't do that to the us for
[17:06.800 --> 17:16.080]  treatment from the disease epicenter in west africa good lot warned that expanding the policy
[17:16.080 --> 17:22.560]  could put the country at more risk really next to headline will be congressman discredited of
[17:22.560 --> 17:29.040]  course we need to bring Ebola in remember last week joe biggs are two weeks ago this week and
[17:29.040 --> 17:36.720]  a half ago to be technical i should just say recently recently joe biggs went out in austin
[17:36.720 --> 17:42.880]  they talked to 30 people at ut on the street university of texas 17 said bring Ebola patients in
[17:42.880 --> 17:47.920]  from african countries who aren't even citizens and what was it seven or eight of them said they
[17:47.920 --> 17:55.040]  wanted to house them in their own homes and read stories to them and take them to ut football games
[17:55.680 --> 18:02.240]  in fact it was october 17th so little less than two weeks ago students time petition to bring
[18:02.240 --> 18:09.840]  Ebola into us and biggs talks to a nursing student like oh absolutely it's racist bring them in
[18:10.960 --> 18:17.120]  that's right bring in unlimited people to have their babies for free nobody else does that Mexico
[18:17.120 --> 18:23.520]  doesn't do that let felons come in and stay don't even deport them if they're a felon oh you're a
[18:23.520 --> 18:32.720]  rapist you're a drug dealer sure say and then have no refusal federally funded rights violating
[18:33.920 --> 18:39.360]  checkpoints where they take people's blood with these rubber stamp warrants that have been proven
[18:39.360 --> 18:44.000]  to be frauds but in some areas don't even do warrants they just take your blood in arizona
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.920]  in colorado that's the first place it started a decade ago federally now it's happening here in

[24:40.240 --> 24:46.160]  clinton basically saying what obama said a few years ago that if you have a business you didn't
[24:46.160 --> 24:51.680]  build that somebody else did it and see they have to wage war against reality because what they're
[24:51.680 --> 24:58.560]  doing is so obviously corrupt and destructive and the fruits of it are degradation poverty
[24:58.560 --> 25:07.600]  injustice corruption oh you name it so hillary clinton businesses don't create jobs that's why
[25:07.600 --> 25:13.600]  socialist and communist systems are such hellholes because the government creates the jobs and you
[25:13.600 --> 25:20.080]  don't have the free choice to shop where you want or open the business you want it's so fundamental
[25:20.080 --> 25:24.960]  what they're doing it's so over the top evil but they got to break the ice and say your kids don't
[25:24.960 --> 25:28.640]  belong to you they got to break the ice and say your house doesn't belong to you it's not enough
[25:28.640 --> 25:33.360]  to pay property tax on this rent she's got to get up there with her freaky constituents
[25:34.400 --> 25:42.560]  what a cult of fruits and say businesses don't create jobs yes individual risk going out in
[25:42.560 --> 25:47.280]  the economy is the engine of it everyone knows that but they've got to assault it because they
[25:47.280 --> 25:53.440]  are against reality and it's got to fall for them to rise we've got to implode so they can build on
[25:53.440 --> 25:59.520]  its ashes their hellhole where obama goes to africa and says you can't have air conditioning
[25:59.520 --> 26:05.520]  or you or you can't have a car what why didn't he say we can innovate and create clean cars
[26:06.080 --> 26:11.040]  and and better air conditioning no it's just you just can't have it live in a shack i'm gonna fly
[26:11.040 --> 26:17.360]  off now on this high-tech jumbo jet they are fundamentally the scum of the earth while saying
[26:17.360 --> 26:24.880]  they want to give you prosperity when their own manuals say they want you bankrupt the first
[26:24.880 --> 26:30.240]  50 years of the income tax they didn't even tax poor people folks obama raised taxes on poor people
[26:30.240 --> 26:38.720]  i want to throw up let's go to the hillary club here it is don't let anybody tell you that um
[26:38.720 --> 26:48.240]  um you know it's corporations and businesses that create jobs you know that old theory trickle
[26:48.240 --> 27:01.280]  down economics that has been tried that has failed as if trickle down economics is the
[27:01.840 --> 27:08.400]  definition of a business too just that term where they had huge tax cuts for giant corporations
[27:08.400 --> 27:12.160]  that turned their back on the us and moved to china with the tax cuts and now they're just
[27:12.160 --> 27:17.040]  completely gone but see they'll always call something that isn't capitalism capitalism
[27:17.040 --> 27:22.640]  to put it down they don't go up against the real thing they build a straw man they don't beat up
[27:22.640 --> 27:31.520]  mike tyson in a heavyweight fight in 1989 when he was at his peak they go and build a straw man
[27:32.960 --> 27:38.080]  that's just made of sticks and straw and beat it up and say i just defeated mike tyson heavyweight
[27:38.080 --> 27:44.640]  champion of the world that's what they do they play mind games they sit there and they define
[27:44.640 --> 27:50.240]  things for everybody now here's some good news on these unconstitutional federally funded that's
[27:50.240 --> 27:54.960]  why these are so bad is they've got local police all over the country running these checkpoints
[27:54.960 --> 27:59.200]  and then when you turn off um or you don't want to be searched then oh we're going to take you in
[27:59.200 --> 28:06.720]  and take your blood but you can't have the prior stop the supreme court's ruled to then try to see
[28:06.720 --> 28:11.520]  someone evade something show you then have probable cause you've got to get it on your own and if they
[28:11.520 --> 28:15.840]  want to stop drunk drivers folks i could go out on friday night and and drive around with a cell
[28:15.840 --> 28:21.600]  phone and call 911 15 times i can find drunks everywhere they just want a meal everybody oh
[28:21.600 --> 28:26.560]  you had one beer you had two beers we're going to ruin your life now but oh my goodness we're not
[28:26.560 --> 28:34.640]  going to take the illegal to jail let's go to part of this newscast w h i o no refusal checkpoints
[28:34.640 --> 28:40.640]  are nothing new montgomery county had one on wane avenue friday as well but when a libertarian radio
[28:40.640 --> 28:45.680]  host blogged about the one in clark county it got a lot of attention drawing protesters from
[28:45.680 --> 28:50.240]  around the state they show in four days no refusal checkpoints are unlawful search and
[28:50.240 --> 28:56.720]  seizures it's a fourth amendment problem very much so and if this is not a positive event then we
[28:56.720 --> 29:04.320]  need to find another way to do our job create an environment of public safety and and i'm
[29:04.320 --> 29:09.760]  intending to do that sorry that's jean kelly uh great so he's not going to participate other
[29:09.760 --> 29:13.680]  counties are looking at not participating and getting the federal money that's what it's about
[29:13.680 --> 29:19.680]  asset forward to seizure the the feds pass laws that the states can't do it so that only the feds
[29:19.680 --> 29:24.880]  can do it and then they give like 75 to 85 or more depends on the case back to the cops directly
[29:24.880 --> 29:30.240]  in their cop shop incentivizing cops going out and taking money from people that have done nothing
[29:30.240 --> 29:34.880]  wrong now the irs is shaking down business owners taking their bank accounts with no proof of fraud
[29:35.600 --> 29:41.360]  this is illegal but if they set the precedent they'll go no it's not we we have to say no to this

[38:59.680 --> 39:04.880]  areas you know that are nice beautiful some most beautiful places in the world but if you're not
[39:04.880 --> 39:10.800]  out in a rural area man i tell you the big cities and and guatemala period is like the kidnapping
[39:10.800 --> 39:16.960]  capital of the world it's so frightening and that's all coming here and and you go talk to the
[39:16.960 --> 39:20.560]  illegals they go yeah we're fleeing socialism and the kidnapping and the murders and everything
[39:21.200 --> 39:24.880]  and we're here to get free health care we played that video yesterday
[39:24.880 --> 39:30.960]  well don't you understand i'll make it collapse here well yes but i'll do okay until it does
[39:32.320 --> 39:38.000]  at least they know what's going on i don't blame people trying to flee that just like i don't
[39:38.000 --> 39:42.480]  dislike water i like water but if a dam breaks and i'm under a hundred feet of it i'm gonna die
[39:43.600 --> 39:47.440]  water's great to drink water's beautiful water's nice you gotta have it to live
[39:47.440 --> 39:53.120]  but you take hundreds of millions of people all over the world not the middle east africa china
[39:53.120 --> 40:01.360]  eastern europe they're just pouring in and getting on the dole and becoming political vassals
[40:02.640 --> 40:06.720]  of the democratic party and the republican leadership's part of it they've all invested
[40:06.720 --> 40:11.120]  china and india they just want to get sold out they don't care they're gonna live behind big
[40:11.120 --> 40:16.560]  armored gated communities this is a planned program on record
[40:16.560 --> 40:24.560]  because it's easy to break things it's easy to cheat it's easy to bring down countries it's hard
[40:25.280 --> 40:31.600]  to be honest and build something and work with folks and to be chivalrous look at this article
[40:31.600 --> 40:36.640]  that i didn't get to for two days i'm going to mention it now gmo's may be to blame for spike
[40:36.640 --> 40:42.800]  in kids suffering from inflammatory bowel disease now i read an article like this by christina
[40:42.800 --> 40:46.880]  sharrich who does a great job for him for wars dot com a lot of her articles get linked on drudge
[40:46.880 --> 40:53.120]  and everywhere else excellent writer one of the largest studies to date conducted by researchers
[40:53.120 --> 40:58.640]  from the university hospital case medical center rainbow babies and children's hospital has found a
[40:58.640 --> 41:07.040]  dramatic increase in inflammatory bowel conditions i bd in children in the us last decade likely to
[41:07.040 --> 41:11.200]  eating gmo's in fact guys i meant to cover this yesterday will you repull me the article about
[41:11.200 --> 41:17.680]  it making the pigs die same corn pigs pigs died of course i didn't need to know about a study i
[41:17.680 --> 41:22.800]  have a lot of friends and family and farming and ranching and they remember 15 years ago they would
[41:22.800 --> 41:27.360]  not buy the bt corn even though it's cheap for the pigs because a lot of their pigs would swell up
[41:27.360 --> 41:32.960]  and die and by the way pigs can eat anything but when pigs start losing weight and pigs have diarrhea
[41:32.960 --> 41:37.760]  all the time an irritable bowel that's on the rise farmers were like hey i'm not gonna feed
[41:37.760 --> 41:43.440]  us my hogs anymore i don't know what it is but let's kill the pigs alex you ride about your
[41:43.440 --> 41:48.720]  shows i'm killing them pigs and by the way i'm not making fun of some of my friends and family
[41:48.720 --> 41:54.160]  that's how they are i mean they're good people uh but that's how they talk and i'm a city slicker
[41:54.160 --> 42:01.200]  from dallas so i talk like this see but i am i am of hillbilly uh stock big time but that's
[42:01.200 --> 42:08.880]  what i'm getting at here is that i had family who are fog farmer farmers 15 years ago say you
[42:08.880 --> 42:15.920]  gotta talk about these gmo crops they killing the hogs all they know is they lose money
[42:18.800 --> 42:25.200]  so that's what's going on on this front and i see this article i remember all the other german
[42:25.200 --> 42:30.800]  studies you name it on honeybees dying they would find gut disorders in their little tummies when
[42:30.800 --> 42:36.720]  they would come feed off the pollen from bt corn being planted in europe and the united states it would
[42:36.720 --> 42:41.200]  kill the honeybees that's a cocktail of things killing them pesticides other things there's another
[42:41.200 --> 42:46.240]  report out pesticides are causing farmers to become suicidally depressed farmers are using
[42:46.240 --> 42:53.200]  insecticides 90 percent more likely to be diagnosed with depression and guys there's a typo right
[42:53.200 --> 42:57.440]  there in the headline likely to be diagnosed probably the computer did that but uh there's
[42:57.440 --> 43:05.200]  that report it goes through that study all the incidents of irritable bowel disorder has caused
[43:05.200 --> 43:09.360]  many hospitalization the reason behind the disease are unclear except for one culprit
[43:09.360 --> 43:14.000]  the consumption is genetically modified ingredients this mostly from school lunches eating
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.080]  processed gmo foods at the time and restaurants
[43:19.440 --> 43:25.280]  and then they go over what the study found in the journal of investigative medicine
[43:25.280 --> 43:33.600]  there has been a 65 increase in i bd hospital discharges from 2009 alone the number increased
[43:33.600 --> 43:42.240]  from 11928 in 2019 568 in 2009 is the latest numbers took three years of the study or four years
[43:42.800 --> 43:46.960]  i bd refers to inflammatory conditions associated with irritation of the colon
[43:46.960 --> 43:50.960]  small intestine as you may recall danish farmers notice the same problem in their pigs
[43:50.960 --> 43:56.080]  who were fed gmo feed they were affected so badly their guts were bleeding in many cases
[43:56.080 --> 44:01.440]  and they were also suffered increased fertility issues yeah i can't have babies anymore g bill
[44:01.440 --> 44:06.240]  gates and monsanto come out with this all they talk about is reducing fertility in humans and then
[44:06.240 --> 44:13.440]  the pigs can't have babies in research also conducted in idly mice fed monsanto's bt corn
[44:13.440 --> 44:17.520]  showed a wide range of immune responses look i'm going to stop right there but let me just
[44:17.520 --> 44:21.840]  explain something this is just one form of gm one of the oldest been around 30 years
[44:22.640 --> 44:26.240]  there's a whole bunch of different types that either grow their own pesticides i'm sure you've
[44:26.240 --> 44:32.240]  heard that there you quote corn crops farmers are gearing up right now to produce the new
[44:32.240 --> 44:37.600]  Ebola vaccines with corn and people say well how is that happening the corn grows the virus
[44:37.600 --> 44:47.920]  okay the corn grows the virus i'm gonna say it again the corn grows the virus then they go
[44:47.920 --> 44:54.000]  attenuated or it's attenuated in the corn well that ever gets airborne remember protogen back
[44:54.000 --> 44:59.920]  in 2000 was growing in texas open air hiv corn corn's the favorite and then they engineer the
[44:59.920 --> 45:04.800]  corn to grow it inside the corn so they can extract it well they're now doing that here
[45:04.800 --> 45:11.600]  but but that's not bt bt is where they take a naturally occurring fungus or bacteria it's both
[45:11.600 --> 45:20.320]  they have two different types based system and they then produce corn that we eat this is not
[45:20.320 --> 45:24.960]  pharmacological it is pharmacological but they don't advertise does that it's it's for corn chips
[45:24.960 --> 45:34.240]  corn tortillas fillers cereals you name it almost all gm corn is bt and then you eat it and it's
[45:34.240 --> 45:42.000]  got on average 1000 times the the deadly fungus that at one percent out of a thousand is enough to
[45:42.000 --> 45:47.360]  keep bugs from eating it and it kills them they soup it up to 1000 times on average that's the
[45:47.360 --> 45:53.520]  average increase that corn is planted and then you eat something with a natural pesticide in it
[45:53.520 --> 46:00.480]  at 1000 times what you're supposed to eat now do you think you're going to have some intestinal
[46:00.480 --> 46:12.000]  problems i know in the last five six years probably that's not exaggerate 50 people i know or know
[46:12.000 --> 46:19.440]  well who are young below the age of 40 mainly women who have gotten colon cancer everywhere i go
[46:19.440 --> 46:24.160]  it's raised money for children with with with with with cancer kids 50 years ago didn't get cancer
[46:24.160 --> 46:31.600]  look it up we are being murdered by weaponized food so see that's what signing on to this system
[46:31.600 --> 46:39.040]  does and it's all hidden spy tech in your phone spy tech in your smart kitchen gmo tech in your
[46:39.040 --> 46:44.000]  corn what is gates and minis coming out with vaccines in the food so you can't avoid them oh
[46:44.000 --> 46:50.640]  thank you you piece of garbage oh you're an open eugenicist do you understand what they've done
[46:50.640 --> 46:55.600]  and so of course you can have rolling stone make fun of me or nightline but but you idiots right
[46:55.600 --> 47:01.600]  at rolling stone you people at nightline you're all gonna end up having to form kids too or brain
[47:01.600 --> 47:06.320]  damaged kids or kids that get cancer at 10 i mean why don't you wake up people you're not immune
[47:06.320 --> 47:13.120]  from all this i'm right i don't want to be right i don't want this to happen anymore
[47:13.120 --> 47:21.200]  more buckley hamlin put together with our crew this maya bola piece and i think it illustrates
[47:21.200 --> 47:28.400]  in a very sad but humorous way that obama does own a bola the collectivists they're open borders
[47:28.400 --> 47:46.160]  they're doing it on purpose it's his abola and here is the music video my obola here it is

[51:07.840 --> 51:12.000]  wrote that and put that out it's even more powerful if you're a tv viewer not just a radio
[51:12.000 --> 51:17.040]  listener so in the next hour or so we'll post it to the top of info wars dot com and prison
[51:17.040 --> 51:22.480]  planet dot com and we'll tweet it out at real real alex jones and and though i'm in texas and a lot
[51:22.480 --> 51:26.960]  of you are in new york we're facing very real danger 1.4 million people set to get it by can
[51:26.960 --> 51:32.400]  un computer models uh we have to illustrate that it is obama's abola now that he's left the borders
[51:32.400 --> 51:38.320]  open told the states not to quarantine turned off all the defaults criticized australia and other
[51:38.320 --> 51:45.360]  countries for doing their job it is now his abola very serious situation but illustrated by humor
[51:45.360 --> 51:54.720]  in the video music video my abola we show the little obama character in the hazmat suit whispering
[51:54.720 --> 52:00.720]  in obama's ear whispering in the texas judge's ear in the texas commission's ear to say there's
[52:00.720 --> 52:05.200]  zero chance of it spreading and it's so safe the army's own reports even the new york times
[52:06.480 --> 52:13.200]  admit that it's airborne basically for weeks now they're saying uh in cold weather actually months
[52:13.200 --> 52:21.760]  so it's not three feet it's not 20 feet it's months and we said that it might be airborne
[52:21.760 --> 52:27.760]  in cold weather two and a half months ago and we're royally escoriated and demonized by dinosaur
[52:27.760 --> 52:32.880]  media which our ratings only exploded the visitors only exploded the support only exploded please
[52:32.880 --> 52:37.360]  continue to attack me please continue to make something about me please you people aren't
[52:37.360 --> 52:42.800]  trusted or liked please continue to add to our credibility not just the fact that we were right
[52:42.800 --> 52:46.960]  but that you're saying we're wrong and then you're proven wrong again thank you thank you
[52:48.400 --> 52:53.760]  see we're not trying to lie to people here like you do we try to tell the truth we try
[52:53.760 --> 53:00.000]  to get it right when we're incorrect we will correct it every time and proudly do so because
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.080]  i wish i was wrong about this abola i wish i was wrong about this out of control government
[53:04.080 --> 53:10.400]  i wish i was wrong about all of it believe me i'm on a mission to try to dial this back
[53:10.400 --> 53:15.200]  to try to have a future for my children not because i'm a hero that's why don't call me and thank me
[53:16.000 --> 53:20.160]  everything i've got because my forebears didn't lay down and didn't like to be pushed around
[53:20.960 --> 53:24.560]  everything we've got because of inventors and people taking risk and building
[53:26.640 --> 53:30.480]  i'm just just admire a few years ago that space jump that
[53:31.600 --> 53:37.200]  nasa did and they had private folks do it as well from miles and miles and miles up in the air
[53:37.200 --> 53:43.760]  from space just the boldness of it to push the envelope you can say what you want about
[53:43.760 --> 53:47.600]  christopher columbus he did terrible things but that was going on worldwide at his time he was a
[53:47.600 --> 53:54.880]  creature of his day uh or lee ferrickson or the folks that came across the bearing straight
[53:54.880 --> 54:03.200]  land bridge you know tens of thousands of years ago this is what humanity is all about trailblazing
[54:03.200 --> 54:09.200]  expanding inventing teamwork individualism and that's why when you hear statements
[54:10.560 --> 54:14.800]  from hillary that you didn't build your business and businesses don't hire people
[54:17.440 --> 54:20.720]  you know who ends up destroying businesses socialist and communist governments
[54:21.520 --> 54:27.040]  you know who centralizes businesses and hurts productivity and brings in tyranny and oppression
[54:27.040 --> 54:32.800]  fascism you know what your own mentor carol quigley at georgetown hillary said and you
[54:32.800 --> 54:38.240]  you read his book he wrote about it in the late 60s how great it was his plan for world government
[54:38.240 --> 54:42.960]  as the historian for the council on foreign relations and the bill berger group on record
[54:42.960 --> 54:47.920]  was to bring in a worldwide totalitarian system he said as the historian of this group i'm so proud
[54:47.920 --> 54:54.000]  of our plan i want to publish it and he said we work with fascist communist socialist dictators
[54:54.000 --> 54:58.080]  as long as it's centralized that's what we're going to create as a worldwide tyranny because tyranny
[54:58.080 --> 55:05.440]  knows best and that's what you are a disingenuous evil swollen liar when you watch that video
[55:05.440 --> 55:12.320]  can we keep it back up of her saying businesses don't create jobs don't let anybody tell you that
[55:13.600 --> 55:18.560]  you know what kind of rubbing her hands go like a rat it's corporations and businesses that create
[55:18.560 --> 55:29.120]  jobs you know that old theory trickle down economics that has been tried that has failed
[55:30.400 --> 55:35.920]  you know in life and in business you as you get older you learn to go off your guts your instincts
[55:35.920 --> 55:41.440]  and what people have done in the past and i look at hillary if she showed up at my office trying
[55:41.440 --> 55:47.040]  to sell me something i'd say get out of here con artist the body language is of a predator
[55:47.040 --> 55:53.360]  a arrogant psychopath who doesn't care and is disconnected from reality like when she put al-qaeda
[55:53.360 --> 55:59.440]  over libya and killed 50 000 people now and she said we came we saw he died well even if you're
[55:59.440 --> 56:07.360]  killing people you don't brag about it she was rubbing her hands together there this is a really
[56:07.360 --> 56:14.960]  evil person you can look at illy not just all her actions not just all the things she's done
[56:14.960 --> 56:19.600]  you can look at a peach with a bunch of worms coming out of it
[56:21.360 --> 56:25.360]  it fell off the peach tree onto a cow patty and tell you don't want to pick that up and put it in
[56:25.360 --> 56:32.880]  your basket i've actually been picking peaches out in the cow pasture before you know been
[56:32.880 --> 56:36.960]  picking some up on the ground that fell it'd be like a little secret about it is scorpions
[56:37.600 --> 56:43.360]  like to hunt around peaches on the ground out at my house we got a peach orchard and and
[56:43.360 --> 56:47.680]  i'm an orchard but it's like 15 trees all with plums and stuff and she'll go out there to get
[56:47.680 --> 56:52.800]  them and there's just scorpions like there'll be 20th i'll shoot a video of that for youtube go viral
[56:52.800 --> 56:56.880]  just scorpions everywhere sitting around the peaches under the trees but there'll also be
[56:56.880 --> 57:02.800]  cow patties and things but the point is that you can judge a tree by its fruit because it falls off
[57:02.800 --> 57:06.560]  it's got worms in it but you can see a good piece of fruit and reach up and get it and say oh this
[57:06.560 --> 57:16.000]  tree has good fruit the the the tree that hillary it basically symbolizes puts off ugly stinking
[57:16.000 --> 57:21.360]  poisonous fruit that's killed a bunch of people everything she does is a fraud so now she's saying
[57:21.360 --> 57:25.600]  we got to control our borders the second amendment's good and and they have news headlines like
[57:25.600 --> 57:32.240]  democrats are asking hillary if she really means it remember the foreign minister of canada back in
[57:32.240 --> 57:35.520]  uh 2007
[57:39.360 --> 57:43.520]  canadians and people were worried about obama and some of the things he was saying about
[57:45.200 --> 57:49.760]  nafta and gatton's being bad for america and the minister came out to the news said don't

[01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:40.960]  jones draper is going to be joining us the father of hacking
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:47.520]  we will continue with a lot of important news as well but i am so
[01:00:49.440 --> 01:00:54.800]  angry about the fact that australia has issued a blanket visa ban on a bowl of hit countries
[01:00:54.800 --> 01:01:01.760]  that's that's a default smart position and then reuters is like criticizing the australian
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.560]  government saying it's horrible that their prime minister tony abbott is is horrible
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:15.280]  and he's resisted calls to send medical personnel to the outbreak zone well yeah let
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:20.160]  africa deal with its own problems and that means don't have the west over there stealing all african
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:25.360]  resources here's the here's the thing australia's got more resources than it knows what to do with
[01:01:25.360 --> 01:01:32.080]  it's the only other continent that has anywhere near what africa's got and that's why australia
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:38.640]  isn't over there this is all about north com through african as i predicted back during the
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:44.400]  obama deception and i even said that they would use outbreaks to do it because that that's a cfr
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:50.080]  document uh a north american union document i covered my film in game so i didn't predict they said
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:56.320]  in fact let me say that i had an epiphany the other day i keep saying i predicted i predicted i
[01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.840]  predicted and sometimes i do predict things nine times out of ten
[01:02:02.800 --> 01:02:08.000]  i'm actually going off what they've said they're going to do and then i report on it
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:12.240]  and then people say later oh you predicted it so let me just take a lot of credit away from
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.200]  info wars right now in alchones but that's the good news you can go out and find their whole

[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:26.480]  that disappeared off my desk a few weeks ago does anybody know where that is we were going to do a
[01:02:26.480 --> 01:02:30.800]  search for that we've been looking for like crazy it's a big book i it's a big book and it's just
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:39.280]  gone off my desk yeah oh oh somebody got it oh now we found it well that's good that's why
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:43.520]  just make announcements here on air i'm on the air so much this kind of like an intercom in the office
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:49.680]  and sitting with the hazmat suits okay it was sitting with the hazmat suits thank you oh yeah
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:55.520]  we got hazmat suits and everything here now because this could really go airborne in the winter and
[01:02:57.760 --> 01:03:00.240]  i'm just got to get my children out to the countryside and i'm gonna
[01:03:02.880 --> 01:03:05.600]  we're getting a bunch of just in case because it's insurance we can eat we're
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:11.200]  getting a bunch of horrible food here at the office now from my patreon supply.com
[01:03:11.200 --> 01:03:16.560]  that's not a plug but it's becoming one and i'm getting ready with the skeleton crew if
[01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:21.680]  there really becomes a big outbreak to lock myself up in this facility we got generator we
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:28.800]  got a gas generator we got a propane hank hill will be proud of us we got a propane generator
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:34.960]  we got generators the whole nine yards around the whole operation over here
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:41.120]  we should probably get more fuel and more more gas more propane and propane accessories
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.880]  i don't think it's going to get to that level but government's doing that digging in like never
[01:03:44.880 --> 01:03:49.840]  before why is it weird if we start digging in spending most our time trying to stop this but
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:55.440]  also some time getting ready ourselves and i think this is what obama said and i said this
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:04:00.400]  week before he did because they'll do this they're scientific they follow a nomenclature they follow
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:08.960]  a mo a modus operandi they follow a rollout plan they'll probably have more tests and they'll get
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:17.280]  worse and worse each time with the ebola simulant with the bio weapon until they release the big
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:22.720]  one if you believe dr peonka and ted turner and others who basically run around 24 seven talking
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:27.920]  about how wonderful the ebola crisis will be and how ted turner will go to his underground base
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:32.080]  peonka says he and his family will die and the great healing of earth will begin it's total
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:39.680]  kook ball craziness but eco science bio science our calls for it calls for kim weps and the water

[01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:42.240]  working on at a contracting gig in uh in bangkok thailand and then kopen yon where i was developing
[01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:51.760]  some software relating to the telcon telcom uh areas in that in that part of asia and uh i had
[01:10:51.760 --> 01:11:00.960]  to come back to the states because i had a rupture disc in my lower back that had gotten so bad that
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:09.200]  it was pinching my nerve making the pain so painful i couldn't stand it um so when i got back uh
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:19.200]  within two days i was on the way to the hospital in an ambulance um a lot of doctors examined me
[01:11:19.200 --> 01:11:25.680]  they had they were skeptical that i was that bad and that i needed surgery finally one of the nerve
[01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:31.120]  neurologist came into me and says we're scheduling you for surgery on sunday and it was like two days
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:39.600]  away um so um i had a problem keeping my electronics plugged in so i can keep the world know what was
[01:11:39.600 --> 01:11:48.240]  going on but i was able to uh get some volunteers to the hospital that got me some extra long power
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:55.440]  cables so i can power my ipad keep tracks keep active in the blog and let people know but uh
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:03.440]  entering my web crunchers blog on all of the things that happened basically what happened
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:10.720]  if you go to my website not my website actually go to facebook and look at my timeline actually
[01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:20.400]  posted in there a uh an x-ray of what they did to me was a nine-hour surgery it took uh
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:26.560]  the doctors a lot of problems getting into where they needed to get to fix the problem
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:31.440]  but they were able to put four screws in my spine keeping them keeping it together they
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:37.280]  removed the discs to my lower back and replaced them with plastic ones i've got to go back in
[01:12:37.280 --> 01:12:42.880]  put another surgery in another month where they put a kind of a cage around the lower part of my
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:52.640]  spine better stability i'm recovered enough to be able to drive and walk although i can't engage in
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:13:01.440]  any really active things like going to conferences and you know walking around and stuff so i am in
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:08.160]  in the process now trying to raise money to cover my expenses so that give you an idea of what my
[01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:17.360]  expenses are um well captain crunch you've done so much for freedom of speech and you name it we
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.840]  are going to call for all your great supporters to go to your blog and support you you know i wonder
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:26.080]  why apple isn't supporting you with a lot of your technologies the foundation of what they did for
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:31.520]  folks that don't aren't tech gurus and or techies and don't know how famous and important you are
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:37.280]  you could hack the the the phone system computers and switches with your voice
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:43.120]  mimicking the tones by whistling into it you didn't just use your little famous black box
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:52.160]  tell folks about some of your exploits uh yeah okay there was um i'll talk about well i'll talk
[01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:56.880]  about what happened really at the uh how we happened to get a hold of the uh white house
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:09.840]  um cia crisis hotline i was just scanning washington dc there's 10 000 exchanges in washington dc
[01:14:10.800 --> 01:14:19.760]  i there's a way of eliminating one tenth of that 10 actually 10 times that so it's only
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:28.240]  only a thousand tries to get into the washington dc 800 system i knew the prefix and i knew how
[01:14:28.240 --> 01:14:37.680]  how the how the numbers uh were a were a planned in the 800 system so um i just started scanning
[01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:44.480]  and i got this number where this really rude guy answered i asked him i says what company
[01:14:44.480 --> 01:14:50.640]  have i reached i'm looking for xyz company and he says this isn't the company get out this line
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:57.520]  it was very rude to me and it it raised the flags i said who what is this guy it got my
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:05.680]  curiosity up so uh after a day or two i went back in on the line again with the story that i was
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:14.320]  white planes uh for a tandem test switching system with the at&t network and we had a problem on the
[01:15:14.320 --> 01:15:20.080]  line and we asked him i says what company have we reached and he said we've reached the white house
[01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:26.720]  cia crisis hotline number we says well we'll fix the problem as soon as we can thank you very much
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:35.200]  that was that was all i needed uh once i got the number uh i found the uh seven-digit equivalent
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:42.240]  of that number which i needed to use for auto verify and i was able to sit on that line for a
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:47.760]  while and listen to calls coming in most of the calls coming in were encrypted or scrambled
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:57.520]  so i said wow this is an interesting line oh i i was able to catch a call just as it got started
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:03.840]  before they went before they turned on the encryption what they do is they make direct
[01:16:03.840 --> 01:16:11.760]  contact first then they encrypt the call uh during one of the direct contacts i was able to hear
[01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:21.360]  what appeared to be a very important call going in there and they said olympus please
[01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:29.200]  in in plain text in plain english uh it was a code name for president nixon
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.440]  and what came next was the encryption
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:43.440]  so i couldn't hear anything that they were saying uh then later on uh we decided to call
[01:16:43.440 --> 01:16:54.000]  that number i was at a party in la and upstairs and all my and some phone freaks were downstairs
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:17:00.560]  and they wanted i wanted some information from them and i had to have something to trade so i
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:08.160]  traded that number for the another number that i wanted so they took that number and i said i
[01:17:08.160 --> 01:17:13.840]  told them i says it's a it's a cia crisis hotline number olympus will get you president nixon and
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:19.600]  they says no that that's not true i says well go ahead and call the number but be
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:26.800]  kept your story straight and be sure to call the number from untraceable line and so we were able
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:33.600]  to get uh jumped through a couple of hops to the number and we got the person on the other end we
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:42.560]  was with an authoritative ways we said olympus please and uh a voice came on it sounded like
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:52.000]  president nixon and uh my friend grabbed the phone away from me and said sir we have a crisis in
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:00.320]  los angeles sir we're out of toilet paper i love it you didn't just break all the president he did
[01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:06.880]  on the cia crisis line the cia crisis line was a special line they used to set up for calling
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:13.840]  you know rather important issues yes russians are moving icbms they're loading them on the
[01:18:13.840 --> 01:18:19.920]  rail cars sir they're moving them towards the polish border but the capability of what i could do
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:25.920]  really scared a lot of people i could get into the autobahn network that was the military
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:30.400]  telephone network and for those that don't know this is a great service to show how there's back
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:34.800]  doors and all these computers and the phone systems and uh in all the tech because you talk
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:41.280]  about it all your conspiracy theorists this is a fact built into it so they can spy and you are
[01:18:41.280 --> 01:18:49.040]  the guy that began to expose it day one yeah better i didn't believe it but i i was able to show them
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:59.280]  that uh a switch in murphy dome was able to forward forward and and pass a call to another
[01:18:59.280 --> 01:19:04.880]  another military switch and of course the telecoms the corporations that built it they all knew that
[01:19:04.880 --> 01:19:09.280]  so that's why this is a corporate takeover so so getting back to nixon and other things they
[01:19:09.280 --> 01:19:13.040]  didn't come arrest you right i mean they tried a few times instead they figured out hey we should
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.560]  try to recruit this guy to really show us what's going on and that kind of started the whole
[01:19:17.120 --> 01:19:21.840]  move towards recruiting hackers into the government right well kind of right but the
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:26.160]  big thing that got everybody interested in the whole thing in the first place was the esquire

[01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:34.000]  big kahuna grand daddy father of hacking undisputed and it's one of those niche things but a very
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.720]  important niche thing that the general public probably doesn't know who captain crunch is but
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:45.920]  to the hackers and that whole community out there there's a lot of uh going on right now
[01:24:46.720 --> 01:24:50.960]  because he's such an interesting guy and such a trailblazer on so many fronts now i want to get
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:54.960]  into what's happening in modern times right now with usur but you've gotten up to the army the
[01:24:54.960 --> 01:24:59.920]  pentagon not believing that you were able to do this and then of course big investigations came
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:04.960]  out of that because the pentagon didn't know the telecoms had put in a system where they could spy
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:11.120]  on everybody including foreign telecoms so uh john draper captain crunch please continue
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:17.440]  okay well as i as i was stationed i was stationed up at indian mountain airport station
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:24.720]  alaska and i had to do a one-year stint up there and during my time up there i had lots and lots of
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:30.000]  time it didn't take me long to figure out how to get into the autobahn system to make free phone
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:36.240]  calls home and they encouraged you to do that because morale purposes and things like that they
[01:25:36.240 --> 01:25:41.920]  actually had a special day set up where people could make calls over the autobahn just for personal
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:49.600]  use and so uh as i was experimenting around uh being back home and on the on the private
[01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:56.320]  commercial network there's a uh there was a switch up there that was passing autobahn calls
[01:25:56.320 --> 01:26:05.280]  because it was being used for both commercial and also military use and they didn't believe it uh and
[01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:15.360]  so uh then adam bowman in the book uh adam was featured as uh i believe he was the one who actually
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:23.680]  snitched on me um his actual name i'm gonna get it for you in a minute here because i want people
[01:26:23.680 --> 01:26:35.120]  to know who he is um his name is uh boy come on there be nice uh it's charidan so if you read the
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:43.040]  book exploding the phone and they and they refer to a person charidan he is the fbi informant that
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:50.320]  got really good friendly with me and was able to uh inform the fbi of these things and he tried to do
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:56.720]  it and the fbi tried to do the autobahn they were unable to do it uh only i was able because it
[01:26:56.720 --> 01:27:00.880]  would took a lot of finesse to be able to do it because you had to be very you had to be very
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:05.840]  careful with the level of the tones the tones had to be really really accurate but i was able to
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:12.560]  slip the tones through this switch which gave me direct access to the military autobahn network
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:17.680]  and from there i could do anything i could i could do priority interrupt calls i could i could do
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:26.160]  as a flash override in the norad because a few heads to roll um and so and the these these things
[01:27:26.160 --> 01:27:32.800]  existed and i and i did my very best to try to explain to the fbi that these things existed but
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:40.560]  they just didn't believe me uh that the the the opportunity that i had to talk to the fbi
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:48.240]  was during my plea arrangement uh i was uh i was basically forced to tell the fbi what i did
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:54.400]  and everything that i did and so they rented a room inside san francisco hotel and i have i
[01:27:54.400 --> 01:28:01.040]  appeared they had about four or five agents in there putting some security experts and they
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:07.600]  contacted the pentagon and the pentagon actually could not figure out how that could be done uh
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:15.360]  rachel in the in the book uh exploding the phone whose real name is adam bowman was uh the person
[01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:22.800]  who uh who tried and was unable to do it despite the fact they had all the equipment
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:30.720]  so going on to encryption and protection and privacy and things like that i certainly believe
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:37.040]  people should use encryption for any kind of communication that they use uh there's a program
[01:28:37.040 --> 01:28:44.480]  called pgp or gp your gpg you can download it on the net you can install it in your browser
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:53.440]  and if you install it in your browser your browser will uh will have a little button there that says
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:29:01.680]  encrypt your message so just with one button and uh with google chrome and gmail you can
[01:29:01.680 --> 01:29:07.280]  encrypt your mail relatively easily it's a little bit a little bit difficult to install
[01:29:07.280 --> 01:29:12.640]  but it works quite well once it gets once it gets going well captain crunch we've got a long

[01:38:14.400 --> 01:38:19.520]  finishing up with your long and illustrious history of a trailblazer before we get into snowden
[01:38:20.560 --> 01:38:27.760]  yeah there is uh i have the certain medications that i have to take it for blood thinners and
[01:38:27.760 --> 01:38:34.000]  what blood thinners do is they prevent blood clots well when i got discharged from the uh
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:41.600]  from the rehab uh i had a prescription but what i couldn't have fill it because it costs 375 dollars
[01:38:42.240 --> 01:38:48.160]  for one month's supply and so i didn't get it for obvious reasons well just because of that now
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:54.320]  i've got two blood clots in my legs which when not treated would go up into my brain and kill me
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:03.600]  i wanted to make sure that uh people also could donate to my paypal page and uh my paypal information
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.720]  will be available to you as well well thanks a million look at your wikipedia you're the son
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:16.480]  of the united states air force engineer yeah i was in the usr for us from 1964 to 1968 i served four
[01:39:16.480 --> 01:39:24.400]  years in active duty in alaska i i put in for ball i put in for vietnam i put in for monkey
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:30.960]  mountain vietnam that was the radar station they had up there i wanted to go there uh but they wouldn't
[01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:37.440]  let me uh you know i mean everybody wanted to go to vietnam at that point at least air force people
[01:39:37.440 --> 01:39:46.960]  did but uh a lot of the times uh uh that i was there i had a lot of lonely nights of just doing
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:53.680]  nothing i operated a pirate radio station there that got picked up in other sites the FCC was
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:58.880]  listening to me and they told me keep it clean and will not bother you and they actually made a
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:05.200]  dedication and so i put the dedication on the air so it was quite loose and quite let's talk
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:11.840]  about your software developing for apple and others and ibm um bill gates you name it i mean
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:17.760]  you've just done everything yeah well i developed a program called easy writer word processor program
[01:40:17.760 --> 01:40:23.040]  for the apple too i wrote the program while i was at the work furlough program that uh which was in
[01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:29.360]  jail it let me go out at during the daytime where i could actually get access to hands on to a computer
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:34.160]  i would develop the program and at night just before i went back to jail i would print the source
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:40.640]  code out of the program take the whole source code with me back in written form and then i would go
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:45.840]  through it manually and make mistakes and correct the mistakes and go back the next day and fix them
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:49.840]  you know i know an IQ test is only one way to measure intelligence it doesn't have social
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:55.600]  intelligence sort of things in it but but what's your IQ you know i don't believe it was ever measured
[01:40:55.600 --> 01:41:03.920]  i think somebody said it was like 120 or something oh yeah right see that's ridiculous uh continuing
[01:41:03.920 --> 01:41:08.960]  here there's just so much to get into are there any legends about you and your freak phone calling
[01:41:09.680 --> 01:41:13.360]  that didn't really happen it's on record you called nixon and his other stuff and they
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:20.880]  indotted you for a bunch of things but uh what ended up happening uh that that that didn't happen well
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:27.920]  well the way i got busted was one of that one of my friends who was a sighted person bought
[01:41:27.920 --> 01:41:37.280]  steve's box i warned him don't buy the box because if you use it they will detect it well this person
[01:41:37.280 --> 01:41:43.440]  i trusted with my phone number but i told him don't write my phone number down ever just remember
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:49.440]  my phone number but don't write it down it was fairly easy to remember it was a number in los
[01:41:49.440 --> 01:41:56.240]  gatos that's where i lived and he basically got busted in the fbi when they came in that they're
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:02.880]  with their grand jury investigation of the aspire article they saw my name captain crunch
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.560]  with a phone number in los gatos when they had my phone number they had me right there
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:17.200]  and so uh two days later i was coming back from my class in college and uh i just pulled up and
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:22.720]  do it and do it and do a lot because i was going to get something before going home and that was
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:29.360]  when they got me they arrested me at that point in charge of me with title 18 section 1343 brought
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:35.520]  by wire and the way that they found me was that phone number that was the only link they had
[01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:41.520]  they didn't have any other link as far as they knew uh when the do-one-one-one conference was getting
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:49.840]  torn down the cap the canadian uh telephone company was uh basically tracing everybody
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:55.760]  but they didn't trace me because i was on somebody else's tie line they only went to that person but
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:43:02.240]  they didn't go to me so so i was protected well steve job said that hadn't been for your invention
[01:43:02.240 --> 01:43:09.840]  there wouldn't have been an apple that's right because uh uh steve job saw the aspire article and
[01:43:09.840 --> 01:43:16.720]  said we gotta build one of these things and and then uh steve jobs wanted to market market them and
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:27.360]  sell them and and so uh the money that they made with the blue boxes that they sold uh paid for
[01:43:27.360 --> 01:43:36.720]  the construction the layout and the creation of the first apple one pc board and that money that
[01:43:36.720 --> 01:43:47.200]  they used for that was from the sale of the blue boxes incredible captain crunch is our guest uh
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.640]  before we get into snowden i had engineers come to me a long time ago i don't know like 18 years
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:57.280]  ago and say listen they've already wired into all the radio and tv stations to take them over
[01:43:58.080 --> 01:44:03.120]  but now they're hardwiring the equipment by law we get has to have it at the transmitter site and
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:08.160]  back at the station and on the cable and and and tv broadcast networks and now they're putting it
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:12.400]  into the telecoms and they say in the future the president or whoever will break in with government
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:16.160]  announcements and that we better get ready for hours a day of government programming
[01:44:17.040 --> 01:44:22.000]  where they just cut him whenever they want well now over the smartphones and all this it's beginning
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:26.960]  and we had a big emergency alert takeover and say do what you do what you're told don't be on your
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:33.920]  telephones prepare for a message from the dear leader basically that story went viral we broke it
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:38.640]  they first denied it and by sunday we broke it friday drudge carried it and then by sunday
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:45.920]  it was all over the news yes it happened uh what about ai systems making mistakes uh over these or
[01:44:45.920 --> 01:44:51.120]  trying to take over uh what about how time magazine says let's have driverless cars by law and not let
[01:44:51.120 --> 01:44:57.040]  anybody drive their car it's like the elite are building a system not designed for humans to
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:45:03.360]  remove us from the equation we shouldn't allow these technocrats to build a world not based on
[01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:09.360]  people where humans don't go to space where we're basically obsolete the elite the transhumanists
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:15.600]  have already decided this and i think it's up to hacktivist and people like you and others
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:21.600]  uh to really declare war on this anti-human movement uh what's your take on that statement
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:31.200]  well in declaring war i'd sure like to know basically uh uh how to start uh getting started
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:35.200]  in something like that is very difficult i think we start thinking about how we wage war against
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:40.960]  this and we wage war by building a better world believing in humanity and and in spending money
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:47.200]  on products and people and organizations that are about empowering humans we gotta let the people
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:52.320]  know that's how we're gonna fight the war we're gonna fight the war by letting the voters know
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:58.240]  what's going on and that's what snowden did when he when he released all of those all of those
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:05.760]  documentation about uh about prism and how prism was able to go in there and monitor everybody's
[01:46:05.760 --> 01:46:14.000]  facebook transactions i mean facebook is and google is the nsa's data center i mean that's
[01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:21.120]  where they get their data their government data is out of date but uh facebook and google that data
[01:46:21.120 --> 01:46:26.480]  is up to date all the time and that's where they get a lot of their information now through that
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:36.960]  prism system that snowden uh talked about what do you think about the nsa and all the back doors
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:41.760]  being built into all the so-called smart technology well they can do anything they damn well want
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:49.440]  that's the problem because they're so removed from like congress and things like that uh congress
[01:46:49.440 --> 01:46:57.360]  was so surprised that this happened and it's it's it's getting to be uh it's getting to be pretty uh
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:04.240]  pretty hairy right now and people of course are being monitored but there are good tools out there
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:10.480]  that people need to be aware of and this is how we fight them we fight them by using encryption
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:16.320]  we fight them by installing pgp on our gmail systems we fight them by downloading programs
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:24.800]  like wicker wikr that's what i use i could make i could i could communicate with my friends that
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:32.800]  have wicker and there's no record of the communication there's not even metadata it's it's it's forward
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:39.040]  security uh it's not that you have anything to hide it's that there are corporations and systems
[01:47:39.040 --> 01:47:44.480]  that run this giant spy network that are openly using it to block freedom movements
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:49.040]  and to set up a tyranny they admit they're setting up a totalitarian system worldwide
[01:47:49.680 --> 01:47:55.200]  we've had benny the former head of a major nsa department number four in the organization
[01:47:55.200 --> 01:48:01.200]  saying it's now a totalitarian plan to enslave and suppress and dominate so so we now know
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:07.840]  what is prima facie we've got to take action against it we're developing a product right now
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:16.320]  called thunder cloud um this this product is it is actually being developed by my roommate
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:24.000]  we're about ready to go to alpha testing pretty soon and it's going to eliminate a lot of problems
[01:48:25.600 --> 01:48:31.680]  a lot of problems for people who travel between countries who have to travel with sensitive
[01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:41.520]  information uh and this this product is amazing i i played with it it is so fast and the and the
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:48.560]  data that comes through it is just like you know you get a youtube video and it and it streams
[01:48:48.560 --> 01:48:53.040]  to your place and it streams to your place and has the data throughput of everybody else because
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:49:01.440]  all of the uh all of the fluff and all of the uh tracking uh all of the internal stuff is actually
[01:49:01.440 --> 01:49:07.440]  stored on the server and not stored on the client and so the so the client can be a small little
[01:49:07.440 --> 01:49:15.040]  minimal system uh running an arm processor and it'll last for about two to three weeks on a done a
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:23.840]  charge uh and and and the speed going through your network is is is blazingly fast unbelievable
[01:49:23.840 --> 01:49:28.480]  so it's kind of like that segment and we're doing we're going to be doing beta testing soon and just
[01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:34.400]  just go to my uh facebook wall for announcements on when you can when when you can sign up
[01:49:35.920 --> 01:49:42.000]  very exciting john crunch draper captain crunch is on the line with us right now isn't it going to
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.960]  be their attempt to suppress dominate and surveil us and rob us of our privacy to create their
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:52.640]  conspiracies of of control that is going to trigger the the new innovators like yourself and others
[01:49:52.640 --> 01:49:58.960]  to come that will actually revolutionize and create a bigger freer web and system that may have
[01:49:58.960 --> 01:50:03.840]  never grown if they didn't force us to innovate so those systems out there right now that are

[01:54:30.400 --> 01:54:39.280]  1-800-259-9231 to talk to the father undisputed father of hacking and kind of the father of
[01:54:39.280 --> 01:54:45.360]  apple according to steve jobs so pretty amazing information the grandfather you'd say steve jobs
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:53.040]  was the father the grandfather john draper is our guest captain crunch you heard me bring up emergency
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:58.800]  alert system but i said so much in the question it was really a diatribe getting back to eas alert
[01:54:58.800 --> 01:55:03.680]  systems what do you make of this orwellian move and the fact that it's been there a while but now
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:09.360]  they're rolling it out with internet kill switches state-run media the government's building its own
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:14.800]  cell phone network not just stingray its own permanent system to steal our data it's all
[01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:20.320]  completely illegal it's a revolution against humanity they are just doing it criminally
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:28.160]  now that that that that that that's that's probably true absolutely i agree with you
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:34.960]  one thing that i want to say was that we're building what we call a preppers data warehouse
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:40.400]  these are for preppers who want to build their own internet privately among their community
[01:55:40.400 --> 01:55:46.320]  did you know that the wikipedia will probably handle about maybe 20 terabytes of data
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:53.040]  and we we've got disk arrays now the size of a lunchbox which can hold up to 80 terabytes
[01:55:53.040 --> 01:55:59.440]  you put that in in a fair day shield and look it up to a preppers power system and you've got
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:05.200]  yourself your own internet connecting that with a mesh network of radio systems small communities
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:10.320]  can now communicate through an encrypted channel no one can pick them up because it's going to be
[01:56:10.320 --> 01:56:16.560]  encrypted and and and they can't shut that down they can't go in and intercept that
[01:56:17.920 --> 01:56:24.080]  this is a solution to this problem i'm trying to say preppers need to put together their own
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:29.760]  internet in their own private compound to bug out areas whatever wherever they have to go and get
[01:56:29.760 --> 01:56:35.280]  away from all of the hassle that's going to come you know what i mean it sounds to me in my gut
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:42.960]  like you're saying sir that you think the system's collapsing it's inevitable it's going to collapse
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:50.640]  it's just going to be a matter of when all might be next 10 years but people need to get started
[01:56:50.640 --> 01:56:59.760]  to prepare now and start storing very important survival information locally on their own machines
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:06.400]  especially people that are located out off the grid preppers that are building their prepper
[01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:12.640]  compounds should also include and put together a data warehouse i'll take it you don't like the
[01:57:12.640 --> 01:57:17.920]  cloud they're trying to move the internet to not be secure to not be redundant but isn't the problem
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:26.000]  is that the DARPA engineers people like your dad and you and others built something that that is
[01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:31.200]  designed to be able to take a nuclear attack isn't the problem that they want to use it as a spy grid
[01:57:31.200 --> 01:57:36.160]  one group does but it was also built to bring freedom that's correct it was of course it was
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:42.480]  used to build those freedom the internet was before all these restrictions that china firewall and
[01:57:43.120 --> 01:57:50.640]  the blocking of calls i can't for instance go to go to thailand and watch nbc they block it why
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:58.080]  do they block it i mean it sucks because they uh my ip address is coming from outside the area
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:05.600]  so people are building proxies i mean they're trying to put stuff on the internet that doesn't
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:12.160]  really need to be there but it has to be there in order because to get around all of this big
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:18.880]  brother activity going on that you describe and uh i'm encouraging preppers to start putting together
[01:58:18.880 --> 01:58:23.120]  separate data where i agree and folks the big industry in the future i've said there's gonna be
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:29.120]  private internet systems things to protect yourself whether it's a blocket pocket uh
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:34.880]  you know or whether it's a high tech system this will be the new renaissance is the battle
[01:58:34.880 --> 01:58:49.440]  against the one-eyed cyclops a big brother this is gcn the genesis communications radio network

[02:00:50.400 --> 02:00:56.960]  nowhere they're too busy i guess getting their stuff from fox com and the suicide nets uh
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:01:02.160]  but maybe pressure to get them to take care of john uh john i want to go to some phone calls here

[02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:14.720]  you hear somebody hang up frank in north carolina you're on the air with captain crunch captain
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:19.120]  crunch alex thank you for taking my call i am not i'm not even sure if this is a word i'm not a
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:24.560]  technophile i'm more of a technophobe i use technology when i have to i used it uh you know
[02:01:24.560 --> 02:01:32.320]  somewhat cutting edge in the past but i've never owned a wide screen tv uh let alone a a uh a flat
[02:01:32.320 --> 02:01:39.280]  screen tv i have my cell phone is 11 12 years old i've had newer phones for work that type of thing
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:44.960]  but all my personal stuff is very old i'm not impressed by technology i don't follow it i don't
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:49.360]  chase after it like all my neighbors and peers do but uh and i know this is going to sound kind of
[02:01:49.360 --> 02:01:54.480]  paranoid and i understand that uh you can benefit a lot and you almost have to go with the new
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:59.280]  technology in order to be effective and whatnot but i'm just well no the new all the new smartphones
[02:01:59.280 --> 02:02:04.240]  are coming out already of the droids with a kill switch for police worldwide to hit a button and
[02:02:04.240 --> 02:02:09.520]  turn off all the phones in the city or all in the country or not let you videotape so we now are
[02:02:09.520 --> 02:02:14.640]  saving all of our old cameras around here and old systems that stuff's going to have incredible
[02:02:14.640 --> 02:02:20.080]  not just nostalgic value in the future but real world applications so don't throw anything away
[02:02:20.080 --> 02:02:28.560]  that's my view uh captain crunch okay well uh uh as far as the older the technology you have
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:35.920]  the harder it is for them to tap and do and to monitor you uh and one other thing too is
[02:02:36.480 --> 02:02:44.080]  cell phones are nothing more than radio systems okay there is an active group of people uh that
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:51.360]  build open source cell phone towers so we can build our own cell phone towers with our own
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:56.480]  communication networks with cell phones this was done at the burning man festival last year
[02:02:57.120 --> 02:03:04.160]  they set up a cell phones tower that they only they only would let you do text messaging but it
[02:03:04.160 --> 02:03:10.880]  was hey it was so nice that i could communicate completely across the playa to somebody else
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:17.520]  just with my own cell phone and i did i go to the place that the cap that had the cell phone tower
[02:03:17.520 --> 02:03:24.080]  they'd register me in they put me in there in their data they're using an asterix open source
[02:03:24.080 --> 02:03:33.840]  it's all open source an asterix server for the the delt the telecom and they've got they used
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:40.240]  the radio transmissions of the cell phones and it worked great and people could build these things
[02:03:40.240 --> 02:03:45.760]  and set these things up and put encryption in there and everything else so they're the possibilities
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:51.360]  of our us protecting ourselves are endless people just need to understand that it exists
[02:03:51.360 --> 02:03:54.800]  that's the only thing here's a question we're going to go to break we can come back and answer
[02:03:54.800 --> 02:04:06.960]  being start answering it now um fapnet on twitter asks what do you think about or has he heard anything

[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:45.120]  drones that are autonomous weapons that are autonomous they decide when to kill

[02:08:22.000 --> 02:08:27.680]  the tyranny rising i'd been a student of history found it very interesting and i saw it being repeated
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:32.800]  in a premeditated way i saw a technocratic elite that had decided humans were garbage and that they
[02:08:32.800 --> 02:08:39.760]  were god so their stamp is being put on the computer systems the ai systems to try to twist
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:45.200]  technology to be oppressive and not empowering well i want technology that empowers humans as a
[02:08:45.200 --> 02:08:52.720]  universal rule beyond azimoth's rules and we need to recognize that it's not technology that's bad
[02:08:52.720 --> 02:08:59.600]  it is who is deploying it and also our lazy use of it myself included dr stallman others are right
[02:08:59.600 --> 02:09:04.160]  we've got to all become activists and do little things that'll turn into big things every day
[02:09:05.120 --> 02:09:08.640]  voting with our actions voting with our dollars voting with our time and energy
[02:09:08.640 --> 02:09:16.080]  chicago activists unchained my life has been hurt by democrats it's because of you mr president
[02:09:16.080 --> 02:09:22.720]  why should they even go out and vote shock video blacks turn on dims they are abusing us
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:28.960]  top of drudge report dot com we've taken the videos posted them on info wars dot com
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:35.840]  but the reason i mention this now as we go back to the founding hacktivist the founding hacker
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:41.440]  captain crunch is it isn't the republicans are going to save us either it's that matt drudge
[02:09:41.440 --> 02:09:45.680]  could come from nowhere to dominate the news cycle in much of the world not just here
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:51.440]  because he was from the outside and he had that understanding of what the pulse of the people
[02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:59.200]  really was not what the system wanted us to focus on and then now he can go to black activists in
[02:09:59.200 --> 02:10:05.120]  chicago who don't want to be under democratic mafia rule and are showing how socialism of this
[02:10:05.120 --> 02:10:10.640]  government type has ruined their lives and the walls are coming down where an activist
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:17.600]  journalist who changed the way news is delivered and the way it's reported and and empowered the
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:21.760]  people the drudge always says to get you to become a news reporter you to become an activist
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:29.120]  i had studied history and i knew that it was trailblazers individuals people taking action
[02:10:29.120 --> 02:10:34.800]  promoting freedom and promoting true free will and true free association that had changed the
[02:10:34.800 --> 02:10:40.400]  world i knew tyrants told us they did that we didn't have power because they don't have the power
[02:10:40.400 --> 02:10:45.040]  they just fool us to go to sleep so they can take over the minute we stand up their power ends
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:50.880]  so it is a fight against good and evil and the democrats have just shown the rot of the government
[02:10:50.880 --> 02:10:56.000]  their power grabbing their tyranny with the republican cohorts but the rejection of obama
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.840]  as this big 21st century brand of liberalism is beautiful because they're not liberal they're more
[02:11:01.840 --> 02:11:07.600]  akin to fascists than anything else and the republican neo-con rhinos are teamed up with
[02:11:07.600 --> 02:11:12.400]  the democrats to destroy the liberty movement that's trying to take over the republicans
[02:11:12.400 --> 02:11:17.040]  and trying to brand the tea party as racist and all this because they want to balkanize us well
[02:11:17.040 --> 02:11:21.920]  that's over because i don't care what color you are look at drudge coming together with black
[02:11:21.920 --> 02:11:26.800]  activists look at all these combinations you've never seen before without the internet how a
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:31.760]  local news story can become a worldwide story now no more compartmentalization no more central
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:36.960] ization he's with us to the bottom of the hour john draper captain crunch we're so honored
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:41.280]  to have him with us i want to get to more calls and more tweet questions john but i was bringing
[02:11:41.280 --> 02:11:47.760]  up ai uh what is your view on ai my concern is all the major money is going into ai that kills
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:54.640]  autonomously uh that kills on its own uh that is in a skynet system jacked into all of our computers
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:12:00.400]  if we get a bad ai consciousness and it comes out of the military industrial complex i think i
[02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:07.520]  disagree with the tweeter i think it will try to dominate and control because of the stamp of of
[02:12:07.520 --> 02:12:16.000]  sauron that has been poured into this techno system that they built you see what i'm saying yeah
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:23.280]  because uh it's not it's not it wouldn't be that difficult to put in a virus on these ai systems
[02:12:23.280 --> 02:12:33.840]  that that will disrupt its ability to to do ai work it's very scary stuff uh and the stuff in
[02:12:33.840 --> 02:12:38.560]  the cloud is very scary you've got to be able to encrypt all your data on that most importantly
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:45.760]  and as far as ai goes the driverless cars you know i mean those things are are are
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:53.680]  they uh are more dangerous than regular driver driver cars you know i wouldn't trust it well what
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:13:00.160]  about a centralized system tracking everybody what about a centralized system that put all the
[02:13:00.160 --> 02:13:08.160]  backdoor tracking grids into the cars worldwide a decade ago i mean this is a planned blueprint
[02:13:08.160 --> 02:13:16.640]  rollout of tyranny how do we counter that uh yeah that depends on the on the equipment the new
[02:13:16.640 --> 02:13:21.440]  equipment that they're using in the car is i i believe that you're right there is a possibility
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:27.600]  that they could certainly put uh tracking on just about everything you do i mean tracking equipment
[02:13:27.600 --> 02:13:35.120]  is very very easy now it's very very cheap i mean a tracking device can be built uh to fit in the
[02:13:35.120 --> 02:13:38.640]  bottom of the hand they just pass it on to you in the cost of the car it's already been mandated
[02:13:38.640 --> 02:13:43.520]  and now they're rolling it out it's just so pre-meditative people ever got that or understood
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:49.680]  it let's talk to mouse link in new york you're on the air with captain crunch good day gentlemen um
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:53.840]  i wanted to ask about decentralized internet it seems to be kind of a central focus of what
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:59.200]  you're discussing here but i'm just trying to wrap my head around like how us as individual users
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:05.920]  can embrace these systems and help popularize them i was reading about uh decentralized internet
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:11.680]  protocol out there called made safe and i was just wondering if mr draper had any comments
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:16.480]  on ways that we can help develop these systems so that we're kind of more immune to these
[02:14:16.480 --> 02:14:25.280]  kill switches that are being put out there well i already have a a website i call ecobizone that's
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:34.640]  ecobiso uh this was a website that i put up uh because i wanted i had the intention to doing
[02:14:34.640 --> 02:14:41.200]  exactly what you wanted to do uh put together a group of people that are interested in in
[02:14:41.200 --> 02:14:47.040]  basically uh removing themselves from the web but actually still staying in contact with the web
[02:14:47.040 --> 02:14:53.120]  in the sense of scooping up data and putting together a completely separate internet or a cloud
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:15:01.280]  system that is that is encrypted to the point where uh the cloud system will be safe to use
[02:15:02.000 --> 02:15:06.720]  i mean right now there are too many cloud systems out there that still don't encrypt everything
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:13.120]  you've got to encrypt everything down to the socket level if you don't do that then then you're
[02:15:13.120 --> 02:15:17.840]  getting they're going to track you down they're going to know what you do uh because there's
[02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:24.560]  so many little subsystems in these operating systems like microsoft windows apples us that
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:30.400]  that do and use of the internet or send packets through ports that are not known not very well
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:37.600]  known but but and then those packets are not encrypted so you you've got to be able to go
[02:15:37.600 --> 02:15:44.480]  encryption systems down at the socket level and that's what we're doing through thundercloud so
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:53.920]  that we can communicate through the cloud totally uh anonymously and also totally safe from us
[02:15:53.920 --> 02:16:01.840]  snooping by the NSA well proven by the and thank you caller for the call the contact
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:04.400]  looking at this
[02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:13.600]  they forced you i guess to see two psychiatrists from the fbi grabbed you one said that uh you
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:19.680]  were psychotic the other said you were completely normal but talking to you by evidence of all
[02:16:19.680 --> 02:16:23.760]  your work you clearly are a accomplished intelligent person that's trying to help people
[02:16:23.760 --> 02:16:28.320]  and has invented so many things that have been helpful uh what do you make of the political
[02:16:28.320 --> 02:16:37.520]  system trying to say that you were psychotic i i i don't know i i i i i i mean these these are
[02:16:37.520 --> 02:16:44.560]  records uh obtained from people that interviewed me and they've just drawn those conclusions and
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:52.960]  i don't care i mean so i'm crazy it's probably good to be crazy these days i agree with you in
[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:57.680]  fact i've got a song called crazy like alex jones i think if we were back in nazi germany and
[02:16:57.680 --> 02:17:01.280]  everybody's saying the nazis are great and we're saying they're bad and saying we're crazy well
[02:17:01.280 --> 02:17:05.520]  you bet i'm crazy or if the aztecs are chopping on hearts of little kids i'd say you're crazy
[02:17:05.520 --> 02:17:09.440]  they'd say i was crazy wouldn't they john yeah i would just take it as a compliment actually
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:15.840]  well that's from one guy who's been called crazy a lot to another i mean i mean i mean if it's
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:20.400]  crazy to invent a bunch of stuff and help people and have a super high IQ and give everything
[02:17:20.400 --> 02:17:24.400]  away for free basically all these decades then i want to be crazy too you're really a great guy
[02:17:26.240 --> 02:17:31.600]  thank you let's jam in some more calls here uh let's talk to eric in wyoming eric what's your
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:37.520]  question quick question for captain crutch hey pleasure to speak with both of you um i just
[02:17:37.520 --> 02:17:43.360]  recently got into the whole amateur radio ham radio hobby i wanted to see what mr draper's
[02:17:43.360 --> 02:17:51.920]  opinion was on like standalone radio communications as well as like packet radio and that type of
[02:17:51.920 --> 02:17:59.680]  thing in terms of just general communications but mainly as a if there's an emergency whether it be
[02:17:59.680 --> 02:18:05.200]  natural disaster or a man-made thing like if they turn off cell phones or something like that
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:09.520]  ham radio is a very good source of communication
[02:18:10.480 --> 02:18:16.160]  any emergency situations for sure there's lots of packet radio systems out there that exist
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:23.200]  right now some of them are actually using the satellite systems i personally don't know i haven't
[02:18:23.200 --> 02:18:30.240]  really been following up on the latest ham radio uh technology involved i myself used to be a ham radio
[02:18:30.240 --> 02:18:36.960]  operator and i used to be uh i used to be operating on a two meter repeater uh in the san jose area
[02:18:36.960 --> 02:18:43.920]  back in the day just uh right after i got out of the air force in 1969 i got myself a two meter rig
[02:18:43.920 --> 02:18:48.960]  sure real quick what about the move to try to shut down cash i think it's key to keep cash going so
[02:18:48.960 --> 02:18:55.520]  we have some privacy as well cash what do you mean you mean money cash yes sir uh well there's always
[02:18:56.880 --> 02:19:03.840]  there's always bitcoin and digital currency we have a bitcoin question for you actually uh there
[02:19:04.960 --> 02:19:12.960]  what's your take on bitcoin i think it's great i mean i personally don't have a bitcoin wallet
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:20.320]  yet i'm really thinking seriously of getting one uh you know bitcoin uh gives you a lot more freedom
[02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:28.880]  than banks tracking every move you make uh and so uh transactions between two people can be kept
[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:34.960]  relatively anonymously it's done correctly okay it's a real treat captain crutch stay there do

[02:24:38.960 --> 02:24:43.680]  you know i have to check my budget i would definitely pay if you if you did a webinar
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:50.400]  teaching course online people could with tape health check in and register and pay i would
[02:24:50.400 --> 02:24:55.440]  definitely be doing that i'm going to check you out on facebook my question to you also is
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:25:00.640]  what programming language is used to make a new programming language and what is your favorite
[02:25:00.640 --> 02:25:11.200]  programming language sir well for uh okay uh there's uh ios for the iphone uh mac os uh
[02:25:12.960 --> 02:25:20.960]  and the new the new language coming out called swift i'm getting into that now uh but uh
[02:25:20.960 --> 02:25:30.240]  uh commercially uh for uh client server applications and web web uh frameworks i've been exposed to uh
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:41.120]  jango that's djan geo jango python and also uh ruby on rails uh i work with both of those systems
[02:25:42.480 --> 02:25:48.720]  and uh they're pretty they're pretty secure uh they're easy to make and build and they've
[02:25:48.720 --> 02:25:53.920]  got a lot of security built in uh they're very different from each other so if you get into one
[02:25:54.960 --> 02:26:01.200]  getting into the other would be difficult because they're so different all right wow so this is not
[02:26:01.200 --> 02:26:08.240]  a dumb down uh computer radio ladies and gentlemen we have the grand daddy poobah captain crunch here
[02:26:08.240 --> 02:26:15.600]  thank you james great question wane in texas you're on the air go ahead uh yes sir mr draper
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:23.600]  uh my my concern is uh you know the technology we paid for is being used against us and we're
[02:26:23.600 --> 02:26:28.640]  financing the whole matter uh we we already have water parks in every city in this country with
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:34.880]  the money that's been spent on all this so yeah we need to find the weakest link in this whole system
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:40.880]  and we need the pound on that weakest link and maybe that's going old school technology now i
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:45.440]  think it's creating our own systems and exposing the bad parts of this is i think that's the answer
[02:26:45.440 --> 02:26:51.360]  great question great comment let's get uh miss tag go ahead captain oh yeah that's true because you
[02:26:51.360 --> 02:26:57.920]  want to be able to have the ability to be able to build your own systems small community internets
[02:26:57.920 --> 02:27:05.280]  that serve a small community of people anywhere between let's say uh five five or ten homesteads

[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:22.320]  caller we got to move quick there's a question coming in here asking you what do you think about
[02:27:22.320 --> 02:27:29.360]  the matrix that's what profit px asked on twitter what do you think about the movie the matrix and
[02:27:29.360 --> 02:27:33.120]  no no no actually that's another person asked that question i'm going too quick here that was asked by
[02:27:33.120 --> 02:27:40.800]  tv agribond uh what's your take on the matrix uh that was a great movie uh i don't know that just
[02:27:40.800 --> 02:27:46.800]  i don't know that it could really happen but uh it seems to be going that way doesn't it
[02:27:47.440 --> 02:27:55.760]  you bet another person profit px does ask his thoughts on 2600 kevin mitchnick hacking scandals
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:28:04.400]  the 90s kevin really didn't do a whole lot with 2600 he was mostly into social engineering and uh
[02:28:04.960 --> 02:28:12.800]  and extracting information and source code on on cell phones so he could uh he could act and uh
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:23.360]  and do his thing uh with uh with cell phones and i could get tracked during that time because 2600
[02:28:23.360 --> 02:28:31.520]  died in 1981 after 1981 2600 really didn't didn't do much it was just a publication
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:36.720]  oh you're talking are you talking about 2600 magazine you're talking about well i'm not
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:44.560]  doing we're talking about both okay the 2600 magazine you know was a spinoff from tap tap
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:52.960]  and uh you know it it's a great magazine it is listen we're out of time i apologize all
[02:28:52.960 --> 02:28:58.320]  the other uh questions but here's one final one do you think it's possible for the electrical
[02:28:58.320 --> 02:29:06.240]  grid to be hacked or go down yeah absolutely uh if they're using this skater system and it runs on
[02:29:06.240 --> 02:29:13.680]  microsoft uh yeah it can get hacked i know i i am very surprised that they're actually doing that
[02:29:14.960 --> 02:29:20.560]  i don't believe that the power grid should be having under any control under with any kind of
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:26.240]  internet control it should be it should be controlled by a completely different system
[02:29:26.240 --> 02:29:31.760]  totally off the internet so it's a ticking time bomb yeah it can't yeah absolutely it could certainly
[02:29:31.760 --> 02:29:37.760]  be and uh i'm not sure i'm certainly not looking forward to it well amazing promise to come back

[02:36:33.520 --> 02:36:39.200]  uh my fault i launched so much stuff around here that i don't pay attention and then follow through
[02:36:39.200 --> 02:36:45.120]  on it i launched a seven thousand five hundred dollar contest about two and a half weeks ago
[02:36:46.400 --> 02:36:52.080]  with a quick turnaround we've got a whole bunch of great entries and i i we do these things the
[02:36:52.080 --> 02:36:57.120]  same but i guess i didn't put somebody kind of in charge of it what we do is as the contest entries
[02:36:57.120 --> 02:37:01.920]  come in the good ones most of them end up being pretty good we post them on info wars.com and
[02:37:01.920 --> 02:37:06.080]  prism planet.com so everybody wins by exposing the tyranny that's actually the whole point
[02:37:06.080 --> 02:37:09.520]  so a bunch of viral videos it's a form of advertisement for freedom
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:15.680]  we didn't do that this time so the next few days when we post on a lot of these info wars.com
[02:37:15.680 --> 02:37:22.720]  and prism planet.com and there's one that just went up uh on the site um and i'm thinking about
[02:37:23.360 --> 02:37:28.160]  the headline i don't even know what to say the headline is it says abola fervor hits nashville
[02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:37.440]  mall activist post activist post post you know posters go up in mall you know act i don't know
[02:37:37.440 --> 02:37:45.600]  what the headline is activist warn of the abola pandemic at mall activist post posters connecting
[02:37:45.600 --> 02:37:50.080]  obama to abola outbreak i don't know but we need to do this to scare them into doing something
[02:37:50.080 --> 02:37:54.480]  about it or they'll bring in just the general folks from africa that are sick i warned you
[02:37:54.480 --> 02:38:01.440]  about this weeks ago now it's mainstream news today everything with these people is about
[02:38:01.440 --> 02:38:07.440]  being over the top getting away with bloody murder that is the name of the game do we have
[02:38:07.440 --> 02:38:13.920]  a video that's on drudge uh shock video blacks turn on dims yeah this is a powerful video i'm
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:19.280]  going to play this right now uh and then tell you where you can go to obviously link through but
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:24.240]  info wars.com mirrored it from drudge just so it's backed up uh and we're going to play some clips
[02:38:24.240 --> 02:38:29.920]  this one the nightly news tonight we're going to play this clip and then we are going to open the

[02:38:44.320 --> 02:38:48.720]  a ton of videos and reports here but this four minute video is pretty powerful this is what most
[02:38:48.720 --> 02:38:54.080]  of black folks i talked to on the street have to say so i just don't know where they're all
[02:38:54.080 --> 02:38:58.320]  these democratic voters and i want to be clear when we come back i'm not saying the republican
[02:38:58.320 --> 02:39:03.040]  party is perfect you're going to save us but the democrats working for the globalists have
[02:39:03.040 --> 02:39:09.920]  gone for broke this time payroll taxes and obama care death panels the va putting troops on secret
[02:39:09.920 --> 02:39:15.920]  death list that's confirmed uh saying the tea party are worse than isis saying you didn't build
[02:39:15.920 --> 02:39:23.040]  your business this is communism mixed with fascism this is if i was reading them you know
[02:39:23.040 --> 02:39:28.880]  a an article about this a hundred years from now i would call this a tyrant and i know he's a puppet
[02:39:28.880 --> 02:39:33.120]  but we gotta pull him down as a puppet to scare all the other puppets so when the republicans
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:37.520]  get in to the house and senate which it looks like they're gonna do we're on them day one when
[02:39:37.520 --> 02:39:43.280]  they back out of promises we're recalling them we have them scared and they are scared people
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:47.280]  wake up to politicians in a few months down not a few years this bait and switch doesn't work anymore
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:52.400]  and if john bainer and all them think they're going to stop the libertarians and the tea party
[02:39:52.400 --> 02:39:56.960]  and the paleo conservatives from taking over they got nothing coming we're not going to sit here
[02:39:56.960 --> 02:40:01.360]  in five years from now have our guns taken which is the plan this is do or die people
[02:40:03.680 --> 02:40:09.600]  let's go ahead and go to this report chicago act of us unchained destroy black leadership
[02:40:09.600 --> 02:40:14.000]  the black leadership all these leaders the democrats are running from harry reid right now
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:20.560]  they're all running on to the next puppet harry reid's a joke obama's a joke all of
[02:40:20.560 --> 02:40:23.920]  them michael moore has six bodyguards at all times
[02:40:26.400 --> 02:40:31.360]  with guns but he doesn't want you to have one he gets on msnbc and says only white racists want

[02:41:09.200 --> 02:41:14.240]  it's done because well whites deserve it or Hispanics deserve it this is msnbc just pumping
[02:41:14.240 --> 02:41:19.760]  all this racial division so we're all at each other's throats it's outrageous he didn't even
[02:41:19.760 --> 02:41:25.920]  say anything to him i mean i won't even go downtown now around six streets secretary anywhere along
[02:41:25.920 --> 02:41:32.160]  35 even like seven at night because here's what's going to happen i could probably send for myself
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:36.320]  even at this age i got a bad Achilles and stuff i probably like to at a certain primitive level
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:43.200]  getting a fight i don't want to the this is why i avoid problems because four people think they're
[02:41:43.200 --> 02:41:48.160]  going to attack me there's just kind of firearms going to get pulled out and then if people keep
[02:41:48.160 --> 02:41:55.040]  attacking something else is going to happen and i tell you i've seen these racist they're basically
[02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:59.200]  like black kuklux klan kuklux klan we're just running around looking for blacks to kill well
[02:41:59.200 --> 02:42:02.640]  that's what these new black folks are those are just the kuklux klan you know because they think
[02:42:02.640 --> 02:42:07.920]  it's it's good to attack people that aren't black they mainly target hippies and trendy type folks
[02:42:07.920 --> 02:42:12.000]  and you know max dresses real nice and you know looks you know sharp and everything and i think
[02:42:12.000 --> 02:42:17.120]  that's probably why they picked him out he's not a big guy either uh it just does not happen to guys
[02:42:17.120 --> 02:42:24.880]  in forward pickup trucks i mean i mean i got an m4 right there uh and it's just over i mean anybody
[02:42:24.880 --> 02:42:28.400]  i can get out my fist but you're not gonna be facing fist you're gonna be facing somebody
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:32.320]  they can shoot bulls eye at 300 yards over and over again with an m4 and i'm just gonna defend my
[02:42:32.320 --> 02:42:36.880]  family and i'm just gonna start carrying guns all the time i'm done it's just time to start packing
[02:42:36.880 --> 02:42:44.640]  24-7 let's go ahead and go to this report here this black folks is in a abusive black leadership
[02:42:44.640 --> 02:42:49.120]  relationship we have to send a message this is the time for us to send a message we're always
[02:42:49.120 --> 02:42:54.320]  talking about what the republicans ain't done for us or what they will do to hurt us my life has
[02:42:54.320 --> 02:43:00.400]  been hurt by democrats and we got in our mind that we always got to keep vote democrat you know
[02:43:00.400 --> 02:43:07.280]  look and see in your community who are the real oppressors in our community they always talk about
[02:43:07.280 --> 02:43:12.720]  black on black crime and when you hear the word black on black crime the first thing you think of
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:18.080]  is a black man robbing you a black man breaking in your house and that is a black on black crime
[02:43:18.720 --> 02:43:23.920]  but let's take it one step further there's a black on black crime and down in city hall
[02:43:24.560 --> 02:43:30.800]  there's a black on black crime down in the in all the state capitals in america where black
[02:43:30.800 --> 02:43:35.920]  folks are voting against our interests where black folks are voting and making us we're getting poor
[02:43:35.920 --> 02:43:41.760]  and poor and other groups are getting richer and richer everywhere you go there's poverty in black
[02:43:41.760 --> 02:43:46.960]  areas this is a lot why i stand there right now how to be aware of what public housing
[02:43:46.960 --> 02:43:52.160]  everything's to live at most of the people at home is living in the street and it's because of you
[02:43:52.160 --> 02:43:58.960]  mr president can detroit where your leaders at there's no white folks running detroit cutting
[02:43:58.960 --> 02:44:04.400]  water on black folks in detroit the black folks running that city they know white folks doing
[02:44:04.400 --> 02:44:09.760]  that them black folks going along with that everything's happening in our community is
[02:44:09.760 --> 02:44:16.400]  black leadership doing this our children know that if the democrats have not done anything for us
[02:44:16.400 --> 02:44:22.160]  as a gift why should they even go out of vote what agenda is on the table is going to change
[02:44:22.160 --> 02:44:29.040]  their life the only thing they're offering the black community is abortion on demand this is what
[02:44:29.040 --> 02:44:34.960]  the president asked him for us to vote for now he wants to have this conversation about minimum
[02:44:34.960 --> 02:44:39.360]  wage raise because he knows that this is the way to get a lot of the poor people's attention
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:45.680]  but they're held with his minimum wage uh uh uh raised we don't have any jobs a minimum wage
[02:44:45.680 --> 02:44:52.800]  raised for what they're not pushing a black agenda they're not pushing a family agenda
[02:44:52.800 --> 02:44:57.840]  they're pushing a neoliberal agenda across this city and these democrat these major democratic
[02:44:57.840 --> 02:45:03.680]  cities this is what it looks like how can the same process happen over and over again and nobody
[02:45:03.680 --> 02:45:09.680]  got nothing can't do nothing about it black leadership is abusing us the democratic party
[02:45:09.680 --> 02:45:17.040]  is abusing us it's the same way in every black community across the country and they force us
[02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:21.920]  into the life of welfare we don't want no welfare we want opportunities to go to work we want
[02:45:21.920 --> 02:45:28.640]  opportunities to own business they bailed out all of the major uh banks and these big investors
[02:45:28.640 --> 02:45:34.480]  but left the people starving there are no tea parties in your city we don't have those people
[02:45:34.480 --> 02:45:41.680]  we have a major democratic machine in the majority of them they look like me these are the people who
[02:45:41.680 --> 02:45:47.360]  make sure we get nothing but then turn around and have us to vote for them again they only come
[02:45:47.360 --> 02:45:54.560]  around when it's time for elections and if they didn't give you a toy or give you a turkey or something
[02:45:54.560 --> 02:45:59.120]  and everything is good hundreds of millions of dollars are coming down from the federal government
[02:45:59.120 --> 02:46:04.400]  but the money is going to all these special interest groups my brother's keeper went to
[02:46:05.040 --> 02:46:11.040]  his friends this whole corrupt democratic system that gobbles up all the dollars and
[02:46:11.040 --> 02:46:16.240]  starves the people out can you all look around your community and see and see any change that
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:20.080]  have come about with these hundreds of billions of dollars that have come through our cities
[02:46:20.080 --> 02:46:24.640]  no you cannot what we do see is our elected officials riding around in new cars and they
[02:46:24.640 --> 02:46:30.160]  have new homes when our people don't have jobs in our communities when we don't have any vital
[02:46:30.160 --> 02:46:39.360]  resources when all the deals been cut and all our people are left out this is where we end up
[02:46:39.920 --> 02:46:45.440]  and we got it we got the most important thing that we got that we can stop all this everybody
[02:46:45.440 --> 02:46:51.200]  got a vote and if you use your vote wisely you can stop a lot of this stuff
[02:46:54.400 --> 02:46:55.440]  that's rebel pundit
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:03.200]  and it is a simple one or two-dimensional issue to say republican or democrat the
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:07.120]  truth is the republican party was with the democrats behind the drug war to ship the drugs
[02:47:07.120 --> 02:47:11.280]  into to stabilize these areas it's all a scientific plan most people in government
[02:47:11.280 --> 02:47:16.560]  or compartmentalized and don't know what they're not part of it but for the democrats to say
[02:47:16.560 --> 02:47:20.000]  white people want to keep their guns because they're racist or they don't want obama care
[02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:25.520]  because they're racist that is pure race baiting the lie to people when the whole point of obama
[02:47:25.520 --> 02:47:31.120]  care is to abort poor people and is to cut off health care that you would have already gotten
[02:47:31.120 --> 02:47:34.960]  through the state and church charities obama care starts getting rid of the free health
[02:47:34.960 --> 02:47:40.640]  care this country had that the illegals come here and enjoy it's just so diabolical but the
[02:47:40.640 --> 02:47:49.120]  democrats are the tip of the spear right now ramming all this through and they are just giving
[02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:53.040]  everything free to the illegals because that's a new group who they don't have their votes yet
[02:47:53.040 --> 02:48:01.680]  they want their votes if we didn't have nafta and gat if we had tariffs like china has on us and a
[02:48:01.680 --> 02:48:06.240]  lot of other issues you would have industries you would have jobs you would have communities
[02:48:06.240 --> 02:48:10.400]  but instead you've had the democrats for 40 50 years saying burn everything down if a cop shoots
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:13.840]  a black person show people burn down their neighborhoods three or four times nobody
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:18.400]  will build anything there and so you live in a desert with a bunch of government housing
[02:48:18.400 --> 02:48:22.800]  with a government message and mtv with gangster rap well that would screw any culture up and
[02:48:22.800 --> 02:48:27.680]  that's been the plan and then they've exported the whole gangbanger culture into every group
[02:48:28.240 --> 02:48:33.600]  you go to europe and there's thug white kids walking around talking like chicago gangster thugs
[02:48:33.600 --> 02:48:39.840]  and talking about street cred it's disgusting i've been at hollywood directors houses big ones
[02:48:40.560 --> 02:48:45.280]  and they've got thug life tattooed on them and they're going i mean it's just and i'm just like
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:55.040]  are you really as an adult a famous you know 50 year old um director who likes to direct
[02:48:55.040 --> 02:49:01.680]  denzel washington movies i need to shut up i'm gonna stop right there i'm like man it's just
[02:49:01.680 --> 02:49:08.720]  it's just even hollywood believes their own dope it's a joke it's not manly it's stupid it's destructive
[02:49:08.720 --> 02:49:13.600]  it's bad being manly is working hard owning a business shaving raising your kids and them
[02:49:13.600 --> 02:49:18.480]  being successful and being honorable that's the wealth and that this goes beyond the black
[02:49:18.480 --> 02:49:22.640]  community that was the weaponized target that was always the place they could get away with it
[02:49:22.640 --> 02:49:26.080]  they get away with their biological testing and everything now they're going after everybody
[02:49:26.720 --> 02:49:30.880]  i don't care who what color you are where you're from you're all under attack i want to go to

[02:49:55.440 --> 02:50:00.400]  motivated this is the type of craziness we see msnbc promoting and pushing that you're not doing well
[02:50:00.400 --> 02:50:05.600]  because of white people the average white person can't find their butt with both hands and just lays

[03:01:57.040 --> 03:02:02.080]  in a really good mood tonight and i can see why with all the good news that's been happening here
[03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:09.280]  the clark county ohio thing was really good uh really good thing to hear and uh i had i had
[03:02:09.280 --> 03:02:15.040]  called the uh the clark county sheriff there gene kelly and spoke with him i'm originally from
[03:02:15.040 --> 03:02:21.280]  montgomery county ohio which is where whio channel seven was the reported on and by the way just to
[03:02:21.280 --> 03:02:27.280]  be clear i didn't give us enough attention our listeners spontaneously saw our article and ran
[03:02:27.280 --> 03:02:32.400]  out and protested all over the state and freaked the government out and they said they're going to
[03:02:32.400 --> 03:02:37.280]  stop doing it and it's starting to spread to their counties that's an example of these catalyzing
[03:02:37.280 --> 03:02:40.720]  events we don't know where they're going to come from but instead of the enemy controlling the
[03:02:40.720 --> 03:02:45.760]  catalyzing events and making them violent we have the catalyzing events and make them peaceful
[03:02:45.760 --> 03:02:52.160]  we can win if we realize our power exactly exactly and i i was probably one of the first
[03:02:52.160 --> 03:02:58.480]  persons to contact uh contact the sheriff because he was really surprised uh you know when i when i
[03:02:58.480 --> 03:03:05.280]  told him that uh that uh what what they were going to do was going to be aired uh has been aired on
[03:03:05.280 --> 03:03:11.360]  info wars and is probably going to get around three million views uh i mean he was like wow
[03:03:11.360 --> 03:03:16.720]  so uh yeah i i sent him a thank you note for for his decisions and everything that's right it's
[03:03:16.720 --> 03:03:20.400]  federal money they take all the money out of the state and have the police begging for it to be able
[03:03:20.400 --> 03:03:25.200]  to make payroll to then go out and do these ineffectual stupid unconstitutional checkpoints
[03:03:25.200 --> 03:03:30.800]  go pull over the guy that's obviously drunk don't set up a checkpoint that is not a free country
[03:03:30.800 --> 03:03:36.960]  great job good to hear from you let's talk to scott in texas go ahead hey how you doing alex good
[03:03:36.960 --> 03:03:45.120]  brother i mean i am really glad i found you you are on the air you have just enlightened me so much
[03:03:45.120 --> 03:03:50.960]  to so many things i would really love to work for you man i am well we would love to hire more people
[03:03:50.960 --> 03:03:55.200]  but we're tapped out right now with everything we can't expand at this point but if you know we
[03:03:55.200 --> 03:03:58.800]  build it they will come just to support us we can probably get that done what's on your mind brother
[03:03:59.520 --> 03:04:04.400]  well what i was going to tell you is i went out and did some videotaping of the fed building the
[03:04:04.400 --> 03:04:10.400]  federal reserve and the url talmud uh url campbell courthouse this morning and i didn't really have
[03:04:10.400 --> 03:04:15.440]  any problem within the any of the police or anything that's right because we've exercised our
[03:04:15.440 --> 03:04:20.640]  first amendment so now they leave it alone that's good that's right and also did some investigation
[03:04:20.640 --> 03:04:29.200]  on mask the m95 mask and there is no mask manufactured today that will filter a bolot
[03:04:29.200 --> 03:04:36.240]  period because they only go down to one micron which is a thousand nanometer and a bolot measured from
[03:04:36.240 --> 03:04:42.080]  80 to 100 i don't know i think they said the m100 but look i'm not a virologist and we'll try to go
[03:04:42.080 --> 03:04:47.200]  up those numbers i'm sorry to hunter and mark i'm out of time nightly news tonight seven o'clock
