[00:00.000 --> 00:05.680]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[00:05.680 --> 00:10.960]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts. When will you need it?
[00:10.960 --> 00:15.600]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[00:15.600 --> 00:20.160]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[00:20.160 --> 00:25.520]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[00:25.520 --> 00:30.960]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know. How
[00:30.960 --> 00:36.080]  much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to fight
[00:36.080 --> 00:45.360]  another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again that number
[00:45.360 --> 00:57.440]  1-800-409-5633. Waging war on corruption. Alex Jones on the GCN radio.
[01:05.040 --> 01:12.320]  Big brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well so does he.
[01:12.320 --> 01:21.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:25.920 --> 01:34.000]  Well, well, well. Here we are, ladies and gentlemen, and we are also live. Glad that you have joined
[01:34.000 --> 01:45.920]  us. It is Sunday, the 30th of August 2009. And we are going to be live here for the next two hours
[01:45.920 --> 01:54.720]  with an incredibly, incredibly important broadcast. Number one, I can't believe that we're almost
[01:54.720 --> 02:03.840]  up to the eighth anniversary of 9-11. Isn't that amazing? Time just flies. We do have some big news
[02:03.840 --> 02:09.520]  coming up this year in and around 9-11. Just a little heads up to folks. Word of the wise.
[02:10.880 --> 02:17.520]  Is sufficient. This is just amazing how all the issues we talked about over a decade ago and got
[02:17.520 --> 02:22.560]  called kooks are now just mainstream news. And the media just has debates about whether it's a good
[02:22.560 --> 02:31.200]  thing or not. And so not only do we cover the news, we unravel how they spin and how they manipulate
[02:31.200 --> 02:35.920]  the different tricks that we've learned that the establishment dinosaur media uses.
[02:36.880 --> 02:43.520]  Here's one. Cheney says cooperation with CI probe will depend. And you read the Reuters story.
[02:44.480 --> 02:52.080]  He's saying that he's basically above the law and that he may not comply with the presidential
[02:52.080 --> 02:57.280]  investigation or congressional investigation, if that matter, or justice department investigation
[02:57.280 --> 03:02.960]  saying he's above the law, his own fourth branch of government, not just saying the executives
[03:02.960 --> 03:09.920]  above the law. Well, he's not above state grand juries. No one is above the law. No one is allowed
[03:09.920 --> 03:17.120]  to say kidnap children and roast them as suckling hogs and you'll put an apple in their mouth on
[03:17.120 --> 03:23.920]  the Thanksgiving day table. It's very simple. The president, the vice president, Adolf Hitler,
[03:23.920 --> 03:30.640]  for that matter, Mao Zedong, they're not above the law. But the media is spinning this. Oh,
[03:30.640 --> 03:36.640]  will Obama prosecute the CIA guys that did a drill by somebody's head threatening to drill
[03:36.640 --> 03:42.160]  their head with it and blowing smoke in their face. And then the fake conservatives get on talk
[03:42.160 --> 03:48.160]  radio and say, we're going to do something about this. How dare Obama? He's not protecting us.
[03:48.160 --> 03:54.800]  The terrorists are going to hit us. Obama is protecting the White House. They've got to burn
[03:54.800 --> 04:01.360]  a few low level people for petty things like a drill, which is terrorizing and threatening
[04:01.360 --> 04:10.240]  to kill somebody. I mean, it is a hardcore form of psychological terrorism terrorizing somebody,
[04:10.240 --> 04:16.000]  but it's nothing compared to the army's own four year old report that they raped children
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.960]  with objects dripping with battery acid and raped women in front of their husbands.
[04:20.960 --> 04:26.720]  And that 97% of people taken to Abu Ghraib and other camps in Iraq were totally innocent.
[04:26.720 --> 04:32.960]  And that the White House memos ordered them to do it. Congress four years ago saw the footage of
[04:32.960 --> 04:38.880]  this, not just the army's report and decided to do nothing. So see, you better hope they talk
[04:38.880 --> 04:45.600]  about drills all day and threatening people with the drill. You better hope they divert you off
[04:45.600 --> 04:50.240]  into that because if they get into the real stuff, they're going to bring all the real criminals to
[04:50.240 --> 04:55.120]  justice. So all you little fake neocons who've been busy destroying this country. And now you've
[04:55.120 --> 04:59.680]  handed the baton off to Obama. You guys make me sick. So we'll talk about that.
[05:01.040 --> 05:07.600]  And then the other news is just unbelievable. Huge economic developments, huge swine flu
[05:07.600 --> 05:14.880]  developments. And of course, Bill would give president emergency control the internet. I've
[05:14.880 --> 05:21.120]  been talking about this for eight months. In fact, Bush was proposing this before Obama even got in.
[05:21.680 --> 05:25.600]  And so yes, we're going to break down the plan to end free speech in America
[05:25.600 --> 05:30.720]  and to federalize the internet. But it's finally in CNET news. It's finally on Drudge. It's finally
[05:30.720 --> 05:36.160]  on ABC nightly news. Finally, people are calling me asking, why aren't you covering this more?
[05:37.920 --> 05:42.080]  Kind of like ask me why haven't I ever talked about 9 11 when I'm the father of the 9 11
[05:42.080 --> 05:46.160]  truth movement and talked about it two months before it happened? Yes, we're going to cover that.
[05:46.880 --> 05:54.080]  And media matters and national media are attacking me, Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck. Why?
[05:54.080 --> 05:59.920]  Why are they mixing me in with those two guys? We'll explain it all important show lined up.
[05:59.920 --> 06:04.800]  This is Alex Jones. Have you heard of the millionaire patriot? Well, you should. He has a
[06:04.800 --> 06:10.480]  free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you. That's right. You can attend

[06:21.600 --> 06:27.360]  patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XT pistol in the caliber of your choice. I believe
[06:27.360 --> 06:31.920]  now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law
[06:31.920 --> 06:36.640]  enforcement and military standards. Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp
[06:36.640 --> 06:43.200]  mentality or drill instructor attitudes. This is real. Don't miss out. Secure a Front Sight

[07:03.840 --> 07:11.120]  behind enemy lines. The information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[07:14.240 --> 07:20.160]  Thank you for joining us. We're going to have open phones coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[07:20.160 --> 07:25.120]  We'll give you that toll free number at that time. We've got roughly two hours spanning
[07:25.120 --> 07:31.840]  out before us. I'm here every Sunday, four to six p.m. central standard time coming to you from
[07:31.840 --> 07:38.640]  deep in the heart of Texas, Austin, Texas. We can be heard on 590 a.m. K L B J here in Austin
[07:38.640 --> 07:46.160]  and other great affiliates from San Francisco, California to Buffalo, New York from Chicago,
[07:46.160 --> 07:52.240]  Illinois to Miami, Florida. Again, thank you so much for joining us coming to you via the GCN
[07:52.240 --> 07:59.040]  radio network. Okay, let me just mention the stacks I've got here. You want to know the bottom line
[07:59.040 --> 08:06.160]  what's really happening with all this news about Cheney and torture and blocking investigations
[08:06.160 --> 08:10.800]  of torture and Obama saying he's going to look into threatening people with power drills.
[08:11.520 --> 08:18.960]  You want to know what's really happening? Obama's running a whitewash of this while posing as if
[08:18.960 --> 08:24.240]  he's actually trying to prosecute these crimes. The torture is continuing. So it's all part of
[08:24.240 --> 08:29.680]  this false left drive paradigm that is coming up, but I'll do that next hour. I've got a big stack
[08:29.680 --> 08:35.120]  of economic news. The head of the New York business school, Robini, who I want to get back on, by the
[08:35.120 --> 08:39.120]  way, he's been on this quite a few times. He's saying governments are already reaching the point
[08:39.120 --> 08:47.600]  where they're borrowing to pay for interest on their borrowing a global Ponzi scheme. Also, inside
[08:47.600 --> 08:55.280]  science, big scientific prestigious journal has done its own computer analysis of who owns
[08:55.280 --> 09:01.360]  the world's derivatives and banks and it's less than five global banks. Yes, the New World Order
[09:01.360 --> 09:07.520]  and they run the entire scam and have more wealth hundreds of times more wealth than there is in all
[09:07.520 --> 09:13.120]  the world. That is real assets. That's why they have to have a global depression to get your real
[09:13.120 --> 09:18.320]  wealth. They've made unlimited fake money, but they're mad because they can't get your house,
[09:18.320 --> 09:24.320]  your farm, your roads, your business. Well, they are under the New World Order. So we're going to
[09:24.320 --> 09:30.640]  be going over the total tyranny of these bastards. Another headline here, NM Rothschild pitches
[09:30.640 --> 09:38.320]  motorway privatization plans. See, they bankrupt government and now, just like third world countries,
[09:38.320 --> 09:44.000]  over 90% of the U.S. and British and other Western world countries of your taxes are going to go to
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.240]  private banks to pay interest on fiat money they made up. You understand when we bail the banks
[09:50.240 --> 09:54.880]  out, we got to pay them interest for the money we give them and then we become their slaves for
[09:54.880 --> 10:01.280]  giving them all our money. I mean, I always talk about this because just the magnitude of it.
[10:02.880 --> 10:06.960]  But again, they've got all these yuppies by the shorthairs and they tell them, oh, you won't get
[10:06.960 --> 10:12.560]  your 401k. You won't get your retirement unless you stick with this and they hold you all hostage
[10:12.560 --> 10:18.160]  while they devalue your dollar. But you love it. That's why you're idiot. So fine, have it your way.
[10:18.160 --> 10:26.240]  Drink some more fluoride. Go take the flu shot. Drink out of plastic where you wonder why you
[10:26.240 --> 10:30.880]  look like a woman. And when you're 40 years old, it's just fine. You want that? Go ahead.
[10:30.880 --> 10:38.400]  So we'll be going over that also. TSA may hand cash rewards, the tipsters about crimes or security
[10:38.400 --> 10:47.760]  violations, turning everybody into tattletales. And a bunch of other important news. Fluoride
[10:47.760 --> 10:54.560]  linked to arthritis study shows other major studies show that vaccines are linked to early
[10:54.560 --> 11:00.320]  onset of arthritis. But again, it doesn't matter what the facts are. We made the Toronto Star front
[11:00.320 --> 11:06.720]  page of their metro section. The Obama posters are by the tens of thousands, the reporter told me.
[11:06.720 --> 11:10.720]  They just said every major street is lined with them. They asked, I mean, is this some type of
[11:10.720 --> 11:18.160]  invasion? And I said, yes, a freedom. The Obama info wars.com, Obama socialism, Obama info,
[11:18.160 --> 11:24.720]  New World Order posters are plastering from Tokyo, Japan to Berlin, Germany from London, England
[11:24.720 --> 11:30.480]  to Austin, Texas. My sister said, St. Edwards, where she goes to college. She's a lot younger
[11:30.480 --> 11:35.840]  than me and also talked to her. She said she was down at UT at a party and they were all over the
[11:35.840 --> 11:42.320]  place. So good job, Austin. It's just global. And again, an example of people taking action,
[11:42.320 --> 11:47.520]  getting involved, going out and saying, I'm not part of the left right paradigm. I see through
[11:47.520 --> 11:55.760]  your corporate president, Barack Obama. So we'll be going over some of that as well today.
[11:56.960 --> 12:03.760]  I want to direct your attention, though, to a CNET story, CNET news put out by Declan McCullough
[12:04.320 --> 12:08.080]  that we've had him on many times. Let's get him on this week. Declan McCullough,
[12:08.640 --> 12:16.320]  Bill would give president emergency control over the internet. And I was out of town on Wednesday
[12:16.320 --> 12:22.480]  and Thursday. And I noticed my email box, the comment sections, phone calls were, Alex,
[12:23.120 --> 12:27.200]  are you going to cover this? Yes, we've been beating our head against a wall,
[12:27.200 --> 12:34.000]  covering it every week. The Cyber Security Act. Obama for eight months has been giving
[12:34.000 --> 12:39.120]  speeches about it. The Pentagon, and we've written articles about this and the Air Force
[12:40.240 --> 12:45.040]  and the San Antonio news tried to go out to show one of the big NSA bases they're building and the
[12:45.040 --> 12:49.120]  cops came out and said, in America, you can't show this. They said, what's the law? And they said,
[12:49.120 --> 12:57.280]  we have guns. That's the law slave. But they're building these bases all over the country. And
[12:57.280 --> 13:05.120]  by federal law, they want to make every internet system, every server you pay for it. And you
[13:05.120 --> 13:10.400]  pass it on to your customers, I guess, have a piece of government equipment plugged into it,
[13:10.400 --> 13:17.600]  just like with the telecommunications act of $96, $9 billion was given of taxpayer money
[13:17.600 --> 13:23.360]  to AT&T and others to put whole floors of their buildings or to build buildings next door to
[13:23.360 --> 13:31.200]  their main buildings where the NSA openly reads every email, every fax, every phone call with
[13:31.200 --> 13:37.360]  keyword software listening. And of course that was all in the telecommunications act.
[13:37.360 --> 13:41.360]  And people called it a conspiracy theory when I talked about it. Then 10 years later,
[13:43.600 --> 13:49.680]  in 19, in 2008, I guess more than 10 years later, 12 years later,
[13:52.320 --> 13:58.560]  they report, oh yes, all over the country, entire floors of every IT building, every phone company
[13:58.560 --> 14:06.080]  are NSA. See, the phone company is the NSA. And that's all this is, but this will cost,
[14:06.080 --> 14:10.240]  they're saying maybe a hundred billion just to put it in in tens of billions of years.
[14:10.800 --> 14:17.040]  Even the smaller IT companies, smaller servers, everything will have a government approved
[14:17.040 --> 14:23.120]  pieces of equipment coupled to it where they can shut you off. They can spy at will. They have all
[14:23.120 --> 14:29.840]  the codes and back doors to your systems openly with, and they're really already doing most of
[14:29.840 --> 14:34.080]  this, but this is just Microsoft's government front. That's come out totally Bill Gates runs
[14:34.080 --> 14:38.000]  nothing. That's just a complete front. They can have the government openly running things. So
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.960]  they set up IBM as a front, Microsoft as a front. And then that's actually part of the corporate
[14:42.960 --> 14:49.760]  records. If you go research it, but side issue, Microsoft's really like a Planned Parenthood
[14:49.760 --> 14:53.680]  front. It's like a foundation mainly to raise money for Planned Parenthood. Oh, you didn't
[14:53.680 --> 15:00.000]  know that. You didn't know that Gates's daddy runs it, but side issue. Same with the IBM,
[15:00.000 --> 15:05.840]  the main funders of Hitler, of course. And then when the old man died in the fifties,
[15:05.840 --> 15:10.400]  that he gave his money and send the tax-free foundation and had to be for carrying out eugenics.
[15:10.400 --> 15:16.000]  If you don't know what eugenics is, you better find out. When you're drinking tap water, you're
[15:16.000 --> 15:22.400]  enjoying a little eugenics. Let me just, let me give you the low down, the down low, the DL, baby.
[15:22.400 --> 15:29.600]  True is a lot stranger than fiction. I'll assure you. But Bill would give president emergency
[15:29.600 --> 15:34.800]  control of the internet. And they've now got a diversity chairman over the internet. And they're
[15:34.800 --> 15:40.480]  saying the FCC is going to run the internet now. And they've got a more than 10 senators I've seen
[15:40.480 --> 15:44.240]  the last few months saying they are going to try to shut down talk radio and free speech.
[15:44.240 --> 15:48.960]  They're going to have a tax on radio, online radio as well, where you're going to have to fund
[15:48.960 --> 15:54.560]  NPR, which is national petroleum radio, not national public radio openly run by the Rockefellers
[15:54.560 --> 16:02.400]  and Rothschilds, the eugenicists. I mean, this is just incredible. And so when we get back,
[16:02.400 --> 16:06.960]  I want to go over how they're taking over the internet and how they're going to end the free
[16:06.960 --> 16:12.960]  open internet as you know it. But before we go to break a very simple piece of this is Google
[16:12.960 --> 16:18.560]  phone, tens of millions signed up for it, basically free phone service in the country you live in,
[16:18.560 --> 16:26.080]  very cheap, less than a cent a minute overseas. Well, Apple iPhone and AT&T don't allow you
[16:26.080 --> 16:32.800]  to contact any of their phones or their phone system with a Google phone. That's how they shut
[16:32.800 --> 16:37.440]  the web down. That's how they shut the internet down is by just blocking off the addresses,
[16:37.440 --> 16:44.160]  but they want physical control over the infrastructure itself with quote, the government
[16:44.160 --> 16:48.880]  having the power to kill the internet to save it and the Pentagon again admitted they've been
[16:48.880 --> 16:53.920]  attacking their own systems and then blaming it on foreign governments as a pretext to pass this
[16:53.920 --> 16:59.200]  bill. And if this bill doesn't pass, look for a false flag fake internet attack to get it passed
[16:59.200 --> 17:04.000]  in the next few months. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.480]  solar power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or
[17:08.480 --> 17:13.440]  triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power
[17:13.440 --> 17:18.320]  your electric company allows you to have. It's true total government control of electricity in
[17:18.320 --> 17:22.880]  the name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[17:22.880 --> 17:26.720]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months
[17:26.720 --> 17:31.280]  ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year,
[17:31.280 --> 17:36.080]  thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power
[17:36.080 --> 17:40.800]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar
[17:40.800 --> 17:45.440]  power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more

[18:00.720 --> 18:05.360]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions. If you're going into a battle and
[18:05.360 --> 18:10.080]  they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be
[18:10.080 --> 18:16.080]  all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[18:16.080 --> 18:21.360]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[18:21.360 --> 18:26.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[18:26.000 --> 18:30.640]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[18:30.640 --> 18:36.000]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[18:36.000 --> 18:41.200]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[18:41.200 --> 18:46.240]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to live to
[18:46.240 --> 18:55.200]  fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com. Again,
[18:55.200 --> 19:02.720]  that number 1-800-409-5633. Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask
[19:02.720 --> 19:07.680]  yourself this question. Do you really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted
[19:07.680 --> 19:13.120]  by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present
[19:13.120 --> 19:16.960]  in municipal drinking water. Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer,
[19:16.960 --> 19:21.920]  reproductive, immune, and developmental system diseases. Now what are you going to do about it?
[19:21.920 --> 19:27.120]  The Acola Blue atmospheric water generator is a low-cost way to take back control of you and
[19:27.120 --> 19:32.240]  your family's drinking water. The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity
[19:32.240 --> 19:37.600]  in the atmosphere and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis, and ultra-violent
[19:37.600 --> 19:43.760]  light sterilization techniques. That's right. Clean water right from the air you breathe. Order today

[20:03.680 --> 20:08.400]  food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center buying their processed food
[20:08.400 --> 20:14.000]  that makes you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to cooperate. There is a
[20:14.000 --> 20:18.480]  solution. Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing

[20:56.000 --> 21:18.320]  to see all the available discounts. Everything is done because of an emergency. Homeland security
[21:18.320 --> 21:24.160]  in Northcom was set up to fight al-Qaeda after the emergency of 9-11. It really was and it was
[21:24.160 --> 21:33.760]  covertly set up in the early 1990s, close to a decade before. And now, oh, because the Russians
[21:33.760 --> 21:40.080]  and Chinese are attacking the internet, they have to take over every local computer network and system
[21:40.080 --> 21:45.280]  by federal law and force everyone to go under government specs and control the architecture
[21:45.280 --> 21:48.880]  of the internet's development and guess what they're going to force it on the internet to
[21:48.880 --> 21:54.320]  and shut down the old web and the new internet. This is all stated by government and private
[21:54.320 --> 21:59.200]  consortiums in their own internet to yearly meetings. You can go read the minutes of these
[21:59.200 --> 22:05.760]  meetings. If you want in the transcripts, it's public. Their slogan is the internet is dead.
[22:06.400 --> 22:13.840]  The internet is dead. Internet 2 lives. Internet 2 is basically like cable on internet
[22:13.840 --> 22:19.760]  where you don't have any more freedom and where the browsers by law, the government is going to
[22:19.760 --> 22:24.080]  tell you, this is by the way in the news, the government is going to tell you if something
[22:24.080 --> 22:29.920]  is a safe site or not safe and they start out with sites that actually might have a trojaner,
[22:29.920 --> 22:36.000]  might have scumware on it. And then now they're saying, oh, Jones report promotes criminal
[22:36.000 --> 22:42.160]  activity, you know, government libraries, citizen paid for libraries and oh, info wars
[22:42.160 --> 22:46.720]  isn't allowed on the European train systems on the quote free government Wi-Fi.
[22:47.920 --> 22:52.000]  So they're now phasing it in. They get you addicted to the web. They make the whole system
[22:52.000 --> 22:56.640]  convert to the web and then they shut off the free web and hoard it all for themselves.
[22:58.320 --> 23:04.080]  And they're going to do it if you let them and they're going to tax and regulate all forms of
[23:04.080 --> 23:11.840]  free speech and quote then use the money to fund government TV and radio and internet.
[23:11.840 --> 23:16.880]  These are some sick, sick bastards. See, the parasite needs the alternative media.
[23:17.600 --> 23:22.240]  And so it's just going to restrict us, attack us, but then everybody will still fight to get to us.
[23:22.240 --> 23:26.240]  So then they're going to tax us and this is all introduced. This is all announced.
[23:27.360 --> 23:33.920]  The FCC diversity chief is what he's called, diversities are, is on video. We may play this
[23:33.920 --> 23:39.200]  later if we have time. It's up on info or saying we need systems like Hugo Chavez has,
[23:39.200 --> 23:44.960]  where he just shuts down whenever he wants. That's the new America and it's bipartisan.
[23:47.280 --> 23:51.360]  You watch when Obama leaves all these police state things on free speech are going to be
[23:51.360 --> 23:55.200]  kept by the new fake right wing government. And suddenly all these right wing hosts will be,
[23:55.200 --> 23:58.960]  well, the Democrats are the ones that set it up. They don't like their own medicine.
[23:58.960 --> 24:03.520]  See how they play that game. Whereas that we would just be for the bill of rights and
[24:03.520 --> 24:10.160]  constitution across the board and the rule of law across the board. This could all stop.
[24:10.160 --> 24:14.400]  Bill would give president emergency control of internet, internet companies and civil
[24:14.400 --> 24:20.160]  liberties groups. How about just people that love freedom or alarmed this spring when a U.S.
[24:20.160 --> 24:25.280]  Senate bill proposed. And by the way, we have the clip of Senator Jay Rockefeller saying,
[24:25.280 --> 24:30.400]  we need to end the internet. We'd be better off without it. I mean, they're saying they're ending
[24:30.400 --> 24:36.160]  it and they say, oh, this is the power to end it, but only to save it. And they're going to say
[24:36.160 --> 24:42.880]  the Russians attack it. I mean, like, oh, Air Force, uh, you know, one might get hacked or
[24:42.880 --> 24:48.160]  somebody hacked Marine one. And then it turned out it was the Pentagon and the Pentagon's bragging
[24:48.160 --> 24:55.760]  and consortium meetings in San Antonio. We posted the minutes where the Air Force publishes going,
[24:55.760 --> 25:01.280]  we need to attack U.S. bloggers. They're part of the enemy and we may need to even kill U.S.
[25:01.280 --> 25:06.880]  journalists in America. I mean, these guys get up if that people won't believe that Google Pentagon
[25:06.880 --> 25:12.320]  says they may need to kill U.S. journalist. And then, and then you can go to the Air Force saying
[25:13.120 --> 25:17.760]  it's not enough to have the army watching me and Ron Paul and it being in the Baltimore Sun
[25:17.760 --> 25:22.160]  that they follow in the Fed protest. I mean, folks, the government is completely criminal
[25:22.160 --> 25:28.400]  and owned by offshore banks. And they told you North com was for al-Qaeda. No, the power drills
[25:28.400 --> 25:34.080]  and the acid and the rape rooms are for you, the person that owns a farmer ranch. It's for you that
[25:34.080 --> 25:42.240]  owns a company. This is about tyranny people. A lot of Germans found out though. See Hitler tested
[25:42.240 --> 25:46.240]  his stuff out on the Jews and gypsies and people he didn't like, but then he moved on to everybody
[25:46.240 --> 25:50.640]  else. That was his real target, but you'll find out. You'll find out cause you wouldn't stand up for
[25:50.640 --> 25:56.320]  America. Internet companies and civil liberties groups were alarmed this spring when a U.S.
[25:56.320 --> 26:00.800]  Senate bill proposed handing the White House the power to disconnect private sector computers from
[26:00.800 --> 26:06.880]  the internet. Oh yes, the government will disconnect your computers. And they've also
[26:06.880 --> 26:11.200]  pinned the Pentagon's journalist vetting program. I think you just found the article about them
[26:11.200 --> 26:16.720]  killing people. No, no, that's not it. It's, it's, it's another story where the Pentagon said
[26:16.720 --> 26:23.520]  that they're going to quote the Pentagon says U.S. bloggers enemies to be treated as enemies. And
[26:23.520 --> 26:30.240]  then those stories was a whole bunch of them six months ago or so, then link to the actual transcripts
[26:30.240 --> 26:35.200]  where they say, we need to start killing Americans in America. Of course, Cheney already had hit
[26:35.200 --> 26:40.800]  teams doing that. So al-Qaeda, how about people he wanted, he was competing with for contracts.
[26:40.800 --> 26:46.000]  Yeah, that's what the real hit squads are for people that companies that are up against.
[26:48.000 --> 26:52.720]  They're not much happier about revised version age to Senator Jay Rockefeller,
[26:52.720 --> 26:56.800]  a West Virginia Democrat have spent months drafting behind closed doors. Yes,
[26:56.800 --> 27:01.120]  CNET news has obtained a copy of the 55 page draft. They have a link to it,
[27:01.120 --> 27:05.280]  which appears to permit the president to seize temporary control of private sector networks
[27:05.280 --> 27:10.720]  during so-called cybersecurity emergency. Yeah, CNET just broke this Friday. How do we
[27:10.720 --> 27:16.720]  all know about this eight months ago? Because the Pentagon wrote the draft. We wrote the stories
[27:16.720 --> 27:23.040]  about it and posted them on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com. And we're Kurt Nemo and Paul
[27:23.040 --> 27:28.080]  Watson and Steve Watson and Aaron Dykes tuning our horns. That's what we're not good at. We need
[27:28.080 --> 27:32.720]  to do it more because we know what we're talking about. Our listeners pointed out these Pentagon
[27:32.720 --> 27:37.760]  white papers about how they wanted to take over the internet for dominance in America to shut down
[27:37.760 --> 27:43.680]  freedom of speech. And now they've announced that the Pentagon wants 400,000 regular army troops,
[27:43.680 --> 27:49.440]  the source on that's AP and the Hill newspaper to quote, deal with American gun owners and
[27:49.440 --> 27:56.080]  returning vets. The whole anti al-Qaeda system is for the red, white and blue. It's to take down
[27:56.080 --> 28:02.560]  the country. We've been hijacked by foreign banks. What is it you can't get? I know the
[28:02.560 --> 28:07.120]  military's full of good men and women, but they're slowly twisting you to accept this. And you know
[28:07.120 --> 28:12.320]  they are. It's time to wake up and say no. So they're kicking all the good military out and
[28:12.320 --> 28:16.720]  hiring illegal aliens to fill the ranks. Oh, you didn't know that? The biggest new group of people's
[28:16.720 --> 28:25.440]  illegal aliens and felons. Again, a new 55 page secret bill that's been leaked, which still appears
[28:25.440 --> 28:29.440]  to permit the president to see temporary control of private sector networks during a so-called
[28:29.440 --> 28:34.400]  cybersecurity emergency. The new version would allow the president to declare a cybersecurity
[28:34.400 --> 28:39.200]  emergency relating to non-governmental computer networks. See, notice when you went for the
[28:40.640 --> 28:45.280]  cash for clunkers program that it's shed on there. The government's now taking control of your
[28:45.280 --> 28:50.320]  computer. It's now owned in perpetuity by the government. Look, if you just lay down like a
[28:50.320 --> 28:57.760]  jellyfish to corruption, the government is nothing but an overlay. The mining drill bit
[28:57.760 --> 29:03.680]  of offshore corporations and banks, mafia, and we're known as gullible suckers that'll
[29:03.680 --> 29:08.720]  allow people to cheat us and steal from us at any and all levels. And so they're just going
[29:08.720 --> 29:14.800]  to rape us in mass. You got that? And they can play you off left versus right to dissipate all
[29:14.800 --> 29:20.480]  your real energy. That's why the media will only report on Democrats being moved off the stage,
[29:20.480 --> 29:23.600]  not that all the major Republicans are being moved off the stages as well.
[29:25.840 --> 29:29.280]  The new version would allow the president to declare a cybersecurity emergency related to
[29:29.280 --> 29:33.280]  non-governmental computer networks and do what's necessary to respond to the threat.
[29:33.280 --> 29:38.720]  Other sectors of the proposal include a federal certification program for cybersecurity professionals
[29:38.720 --> 29:42.800]  and a requirement that certain computer systems and networks and private sector be managed by
[29:42.800 --> 29:48.480]  people who have been awarded the license who are basically federal spooks. This was already most
[29:48.480 --> 29:56.560]  the new major grants and scholarships for the last eight years. They've been gearing up for this
[29:56.560 --> 30:04.080]  in a big way. Stay with us. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying
[30:04.080 --> 30:08.640]  a solar power generator this summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or
[30:08.640 --> 30:13.840]  triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your
[30:13.840 --> 30:18.560]  electric company allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the
[30:18.560 --> 30:23.440]  name of smart grid technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power
[30:23.440 --> 30:27.920]  grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four,
[30:27.920 --> 30:32.320]  the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families
[30:32.320 --> 30:37.040]  lose their power from weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides
[30:37.040 --> 30:41.760]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators
[30:41.760 --> 30:46.640]  offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more information at
[30:46.640 --> 30:53.280]  www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the

[32:05.280 --> 32:10.480]  and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want? My answer would be all I
[32:10.480 --> 32:16.080]  can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones. Food is your only ammunition.
[32:16.080 --> 32:21.360]  How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the battle starts? When will you need it?
[32:21.360 --> 32:26.000]  Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be any food? Will it make your children
[32:26.000 --> 32:30.640]  sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[32:30.640 --> 32:36.000]  and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply. Food is your
[32:36.000 --> 32:41.200]  ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much will you need? We don't know.
[32:41.200 --> 32:45.920]  How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of you good guys to
[32:45.920 --> 32:54.880]  live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.

[33:03.440 --> 33:07.840]  even the food they want you to eat. Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their
[33:07.840 --> 33:12.720]  processed food that makes you sick? Go to the doctor and buy their drugs? You don't have to
[33:12.720 --> 33:17.840]  cooperate. There is a solution. Inner Health Botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love,

[34:09.680 --> 34:21.840]  We can't believe that it's happening here.
[34:22.960 --> 34:30.720]  We can't believe that in our own republic, in our supposed free society,
[34:30.720 --> 34:39.440]  that classical tyranny is growing. And there's always excuses, there's always
[34:39.440 --> 34:46.880]  rationales. But Homeland Security, it states in its own DHS reports that their entire system,
[34:46.880 --> 34:54.000]  that its main focus is the American gun owner. It's all for us folks. We've been conquered
[34:54.000 --> 35:01.440]  illegitimately, illegally through fiat banking, through Ponzi schemes by offshore banks, and they
[35:01.440 --> 35:08.080]  wrap all their tyranny in the American flag. And now, the feds are openly saying they're
[35:08.080 --> 35:15.760]  taking over the entire internet and even your small IT company. And everything's going to be
[35:15.760 --> 35:21.600]  data mining. Everything is, I mean, the majority of new scholarships are for Homeland Security
[35:21.600 --> 35:28.240]  related. CIA, radio and TV ads are everywhere. They're taking over our society. There's not
[35:28.240 --> 35:34.160]  going to be jobs available that aren't in those positions. And they're taking weak-minded people,
[35:34.160 --> 35:38.000]  getting them jacked up, taking them right out of the military and other places,
[35:38.000 --> 35:44.160]  making them CIA, making them NSA. And they think they're God. They think the Bill of Rights
[35:44.160 --> 35:48.560]  Constitution is here to be walked on and they're turning them loose on us. And I just want to
[35:48.560 --> 35:55.040]  warn everybody, this is real. If you ever wanted to stand up for the Republic, if you ever wanted
[35:55.040 --> 36:01.040]  to fight tyranny, this is it. Now, I know there's a lot of good people in the police, in the military,
[36:01.040 --> 36:07.200]  and even the CIA and FBI. They send us a lot of material, a lot of information that turns out to
[36:07.200 --> 36:13.680]  be accurate and very, very damning to the establishment. That's why they're trying to grow
[36:13.680 --> 36:17.760]  this huge new crop. That's why they're creating all these new agencies with new people and new
[36:17.760 --> 36:25.920]  directives. And they're going to be massive purges of people in the system. Look, the government's
[36:25.920 --> 36:32.080]  gone bad, okay? And I want to now get into overall censorship and then start taking your phone calls.
[36:32.080 --> 36:41.120]  In the next segment, the toll-free number to join us is 888-201-2244-8888-2012244 or direct
[36:41.120 --> 36:47.520]  line of listing in Central Texas, 512-646-1776. That's a terrorist number, I know.
[36:47.520 --> 36:56.000]  According to FEMA, 512-646-1776. And this is the spirit of 1776 is what this radio shows all about.
[36:56.000 --> 37:02.880]  888-201-2244. You want to know where we stand? It's with 1776. You want to stand with 1984 and
[37:02.880 --> 37:13.280]  all the tyranny? Go right ahead. But don't lie to yourself. And it goes on to Larry Clinton,
[37:13.280 --> 37:17.760]  president of the Internet Security Alliance, saying this is a total takeover of the Internet,
[37:18.640 --> 37:24.560]  the Carnegie Mellon University admitting that it's total tyranny. I mean, it's just all right here.
[37:25.280 --> 37:33.200]  So there's no more, no more denial about the feds taking over the Internet. And by the way,
[37:33.200 --> 37:40.640]  Yahoo and Google, they helped set up the spying systems and the Internet shutdown systems
[37:40.640 --> 37:46.320]  in the last 15 years in Tehran, Iran, in Beijing, China,
[37:49.280 --> 37:58.480]  in these countries where this type of censorship goes on. Okay. Look, Homeland Security seven years
[37:58.480 --> 38:04.000]  ago didn't hire Marcus Wolf, the former head of the East German Stasi, the worst spies ever.
[38:04.000 --> 38:07.600]  I mean, and I didn't believe it when I saw it in the news and I went and saw the federal
[38:07.600 --> 38:13.440]  congressional funding of over a million bucks over two years for Marcus Wolf. And then now you
[38:13.440 --> 38:18.240]  read in the news every day where they're training neighbors out of spy on neighbors and they announced,
[38:18.240 --> 38:22.400]  come out, come to local FBI meeting, come to local Homeland Security meeting, come to the
[38:22.400 --> 38:27.680]  InfraGuard meeting. We want you to fight al-Qaeda, come to the Eagle Eyes meeting for, you know,
[38:27.680 --> 38:33.840]  now a million truck drivers that have enrolled. And you show up and we've got the manuals,
[38:33.840 --> 38:38.560]  we've shown them on air, we've shown video clips in these seminars and they buy you lunch
[38:38.560 --> 38:44.240]  two days at a hotel, your company sends it, you'll get a little discount on your insurance if you do
[38:44.240 --> 38:49.840]  and they spend 20 minutes on al-Qaeda showing them at a training camp, CIA funded but don't tell
[38:49.840 --> 38:54.480]  you that. And then the rest of it is this guy drinking and driving, is this person spanking
[38:54.480 --> 39:00.640]  their kid, is this guy got marijuana plants in his backyard, it's how to spy on the American people.
[39:00.640 --> 39:06.720]  The entire infrastructure of government is to gang rape you, you understand that?
[39:08.480 --> 39:12.240]  Because it isn't government, but look, the point is here's that censorship.
[39:13.360 --> 39:24.880]  Now, next up, every day or two I get attacked by media matters and by daily costs and by
[39:24.880 --> 39:35.040]  think progress and by alternate. And if you go to the federal filings for foundations,
[39:35.040 --> 39:41.520]  you can just Google federal filings for alternate or for daily costs and then you'll,
[39:41.520 --> 39:47.840]  it'll take you to links, that it'll say number one funder, Rockefeller Foundation,
[39:47.840 --> 39:56.080]  number two funder, UN, it's different for each one, number three funder, George Soros Foundation.
[39:56.080 --> 40:03.040]  I mean, I, I have, this is creepy, I have George Soros, I have Al Gore's Foundation,
[40:03.040 --> 40:12.000]  that guy's a multi-billionaire, I have all these guys attacking three people and this is really
[40:12.000 --> 40:20.400]  creeping me out. They're attacking three people and they attack me as often now, Rush Limbaugh,
[40:21.440 --> 40:30.400]  Glenn Beck and Alex Jones. And they are attacking me every couple days. I mean, I'm not even trying
[40:30.400 --> 40:39.120]  to pay attention to this, but I have to counter it because they always build straw men. Now,
[40:39.120 --> 40:44.320]  before I get into Limbaugh and Beck, who obviously I don't align myself with, but we're going to
[40:44.320 --> 40:52.640]  explain why they're doing this. The reason this is so creepy is remember Poplowski who shot the
[40:52.640 --> 40:57.840]  three cops at his house because his mother woke him up drunk. He had pit bulls, he wouldn't get a
[40:57.840 --> 41:01.600]  job, wouldn't, wouldn't take care of the dogs. They were urinating all over the carpet and
[41:01.600 --> 41:07.920]  crapping everywhere and he throws a fit, the cops show up, he shoots one, throws a fit, shoots two
[41:07.920 --> 41:14.480]  more. On his computer, he'd visited thousands of sites like anybody else and we later, this came
[41:14.480 --> 41:19.600]  out in court and we later could do searches on his handle and we first found it out this way.
[41:19.600 --> 41:24.720]  He was attacking me on the internet because I don't get into anti-Semitism and racial issues.
[41:24.720 --> 41:28.640]  We're trying to bring them all together against tyranny and not make it about race or religion
[41:28.640 --> 41:35.760]  or groups. Within two hours of him being in custody, the Southern Poverty Law Center, through their
[41:35.760 --> 41:41.440]  writer at the local paper, the guy that writes the stories for him, said that he did it because of me.
[41:42.240 --> 41:46.240]  Now, we later got his handle and Googled his name and found out he was attacking me on all
[41:46.240 --> 41:53.200]  the big Nazi sites that our government run and that's come out. Within two hours, folks, it turned
[41:53.200 --> 41:59.520]  out he visited CNN, Fox, every other, you know, he was an internet head. They, within, I mean,
[41:59.520 --> 42:03.680]  they're after me, folks. They're after me. Okay. And they're after Glenbeck and they're after
[42:03.680 --> 42:10.640]  Rush Limbaugh and they lie about everything. When Vaughn Brune went and shot the security guard at
[42:10.640 --> 42:17.840]  the Jewish center, they blamed Limbaugh, who is an absolute pro-Israel all the way. They attack
[42:17.840 --> 42:22.240]  Beck, who's pro-Israel and they attack me and I am against a lot of the things Israel does,
[42:22.240 --> 42:27.840]  but I try to be even handed with it. So why is Glenbeck, Rush Limbaugh and Alex Jones,
[42:27.840 --> 42:35.120]  what George Soros is thinking about and the Rockefeller Foundation? Why? Why does Ron Paul
[42:35.120 --> 42:39.680]  have the army following him around declassified? Why do I have the army following me around?
[42:39.680 --> 42:46.480]  Totally illegal. Well, they don't like Limbaugh and Beck and I'm going to go over this in the next
[42:46.480 --> 42:50.240]  30 minutes and, and, and after we take some calls, but, but I want to go ahead and get to the main
[42:50.240 --> 43:00.160]  meat of this now. They're going after Beck and Limbaugh because they want to make it about a
[43:00.160 --> 43:04.320]  left-right issue. And I said this during the campaign and then White House Mimos came out six,
[43:04.320 --> 43:09.600]  seven months ago. It's in my film, The Obama Deception, where they say we love it when Limbaugh
[43:09.600 --> 43:14.960]  attacks us because it makes it left-right. That energizes our base because the left in this country
[43:14.960 --> 43:21.040]  isn't going to support Obama's pro-war, pro-wiretapping, pro-torture, rendition, all the bad things he's
[43:21.040 --> 43:26.240]  doing unless he poses like a liberal. And so when he comes out and says we're going to prosecute
[43:26.240 --> 43:33.600]  the CIA for threatening people with drills, with drilling their ears, then the left thinks,
[43:33.600 --> 43:38.640]  oh, Obama's good. See, so we're going to explain this, but, but why are they attacking me? Why are
[43:38.640 --> 43:48.240]  they mixing me in to that? Okay, we're going to break this down. And Limbaugh is now telling the
[43:48.240 --> 43:53.440]  truth. He says he's afraid that Obama is going to stage an event. Michael Savage says he believes
[43:53.440 --> 43:57.920]  Obama's going to blow up a city. We'll be right back and blame it on somebody.
[44:00.240 --> 44:04.880]  Hello, friends. This is Alex Jones, and I want each of you to ask yourself this question. Do you
[44:04.880 --> 44:10.240]  really know what's in your tap water? In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor,
[44:10.240 --> 44:15.360]  they found that over 260 chemicals in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water. Many
[44:15.360 --> 44:19.840]  of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune, and developmental system
[44:19.840 --> 44:25.280]  diseases. Now what are you going to do about it? The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a

[46:00.320 --> 46:05.120]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this
[46:05.120 --> 46:09.600]  summer. Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[46:09.600 --> 46:14.880]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[46:14.880 --> 46:20.000]  to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[46:20.000 --> 46:24.880]  is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[46:24.880 --> 46:28.960]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead. Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[46:28.960 --> 46:33.120]  summer storm season is here again. Every year, thousands of families lose their power from
[46:33.120 --> 46:38.240]  weather related outages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[46:38.240 --> 46:43.200]  peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[46:43.200 --> 46:49.760]  a longtime sponsor of ours. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's
[46:49.760 --> 46:55.600]  mysolarbackup.com. Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[46:55.600 --> 47:03.760]  or call toll-free 877-327-0365. Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[47:03.760 --> 47:08.640]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you
[47:08.640 --> 47:13.840]  want? My answer would be all I can get. In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved
[47:13.840 --> 47:19.440]  ones, food is your only ammunition. How much do you want? When do you want it? Now or after the
[47:19.440 --> 47:24.240]  battle starts? When will you need it? Can you buy it without proper identification? Will there be
[47:24.240 --> 47:29.040]  any food? Will it make your children sick? If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself,
[47:29.040 --> 47:33.680]  will you go to the gathering center and be immunized? You wipe out all these problems if
[47:33.680 --> 47:39.520]  you have a good food supply. Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life. How much
[47:39.520 --> 47:45.120]  will you need? We don't know. How much do you want? All you can get. I'm Alex Jones. I want all of
[47:45.120 --> 47:53.120]  you good guys to live to fight another day. Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web
[47:53.120 --> 48:09.040]  at eFoodsDirect.com. Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[48:09.040 --> 48:24.240]  Okay, so the George Soros David Rockefeller funded media matters who attacks me every week, but
[48:24.240 --> 48:33.040]  of this group of sites funded by these government funded groups, I'm attacked almost every day now
[48:33.040 --> 48:38.720]  and you can read the story up on infowars.com and prisonpunna.com. We link through to it
[48:40.160 --> 48:46.240]  and they say in here that we are lying and that we are insane, that we are dangerous and that
[48:46.240 --> 48:54.160]  there is no plan for a civilian national security force. That's a quote from the article and that
[48:54.160 --> 49:03.360]  it's just complete lies. And they say, Limbaugh is insane. I am insane. Glenn Beck is insane.
[49:07.280 --> 49:11.760]  And even if Limbaugh defends the Republican Party, a lot of times when he shouldn't,
[49:12.560 --> 49:18.240]  whenever that groups in power, it doesn't matter. Obama gave scores of speeches calling for a
[49:18.240 --> 49:23.680]  civilian work brigade and military force. We're going to play a club of it in a minute.
[49:23.680 --> 49:28.080]  Rahm Emanuel wrote a book about it. They've introduced four different bills. One of them
[49:28.640 --> 49:34.320]  passed with language to set up the federal body to begin the preparations for compulsory service.
[49:35.040 --> 49:41.360]  We've read the sections about national service for anybody in high school, college,
[49:41.360 --> 49:46.400]  three months of military training every summer. I'm going to play these clips right now of the
[49:46.400 --> 49:54.720]  White House Chief of Staff on C-SPAN and Obama on C-SPAN. Now, they just say we're insane liars
[49:54.720 --> 50:00.880]  and then link to our articles where I'm, where info wars has it posted. I mean, that'd be like
[50:00.880 --> 50:08.640]  if I said the sun is in the sky right now over the central time zone and you walk outside at 449
[50:08.640 --> 50:13.440]  and 10 seconds and the sun is in the sky. And that'd be like media matters saying, no,
[50:13.440 --> 50:21.200]  no, it's not true. And I've got all the videos of AmeriCorps and Secure Corps of the Division
[50:21.200 --> 50:27.200]  of it and the kids training with M16s to quote, take on the militias. And it's in the New York
[50:27.200 --> 50:32.400]  Times. Oh, look at our new youth brigades training with Homeland Security to take on
[50:32.400 --> 50:39.680]  the right wing terrorist. I mean, you can't make this up. It's true. It started
[50:39.680 --> 50:48.480]  under Bush senior under Clinton, Bush Jr. And now it's exploded. They're really setting this up.
[50:50.320 --> 50:55.200]  I mean, in fact, we should queue up the trailer. It's up on the main page of info wars.com. We
[50:55.200 --> 51:02.000]  should keep the trailer because it has the clip of it in there of city year. One of the the group
[51:02.000 --> 51:07.120]  David Gergen runs the Republican who quote handles the Democrats, Richard Nixon's minion,
[51:07.120 --> 51:12.640]  with them in black and red uniforms doing military drills and saying their fears
[51:13.360 --> 51:18.720]  and going out and beating people up the Obama supporters. In fact, I was on daily costs and
[51:18.720 --> 51:25.440]  the very union that has their thugs beating up anybody that goes to town halls is the one advertising.
[51:25.440 --> 51:32.160]  I mean, these people are getting federal money. Acorns getting $2 billion. This is Chicago mafia
[51:32.160 --> 51:38.960]  tactics and I as a red blooded American am not putting up with it. But look, go read Media Matters
[51:38.960 --> 51:44.640]  story front page right now. Media Matters saying none of these youth brigades exist,
[51:44.640 --> 51:50.400]  then link through to the very link they have on there. And it's not us saying it. It's the president
[51:50.400 --> 51:56.400]  and his chief of staff. Here is the president. Here is Barack Obama talking about a civilian
[51:56.400 --> 52:04.640]  force as big as the Pentagon. Here it is. We cannot continue to rely only on our military
[52:04.640 --> 52:09.200]  in order to achieve the national security objectives that we've set. We've got to have
[52:09.200 --> 52:15.680]  a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well funded.
[52:15.680 --> 52:26.640]  Now, I have three mainstream news articles that I printed off prisonplanet.com and infowars today
[52:26.640 --> 52:33.040]  where they're announcing local tattletale squads to look for extremist, the TSAs on the streets of
[52:33.040 --> 52:38.880]  America now looking for spies, federal spies. Homeland security said that seven years ago
[52:38.880 --> 52:43.440]  that they were going to expand out to the shopping malls and everywhere else. It's happening. It's
[52:43.440 --> 52:50.080]  bipartisan. Now, that is enough for you. We can play clip after clip of Obama saying it.
[52:50.080 --> 52:53.680]  That's one of the more famous ones. I've got a bunch of new ones in my upcoming film,
[52:53.680 --> 52:58.960]  Fall of the Republic, about Obama. Let's go to Rahm Emanuel. This is the chief of staff
[52:58.960 --> 53:01.520]  on C-SPAN saying it. Here he is.
[53:01.520 --> 53:14.320]  All right, and the video's got some text at the front. What did Barack Obama mean when he said
[53:15.120 --> 53:19.680]  that we're going to have a national security force? This is Rahm Emanuel C-SPAN. Here it is,
[53:19.680 --> 53:24.480]  ladies and gentlemen. Congressman Rahm Emanuel has been picked by Barack Obama to be his White
[53:24.480 --> 53:29.200]  House chief of staff. And now you have a book with the ambitious title of the plan,
[53:29.200 --> 53:34.720]  the word universal comes through a lot. Universal will scare some people. They will think
[53:35.280 --> 53:40.560]  the government program, the idea of universal citizen service. You have to participate.
[53:40.560 --> 53:46.240]  Citizenship is not an entitlement program. It comes with responsibilities. Everybody somewhere
[53:46.240 --> 53:50.480]  between the ages of 1825 will serve three months of basic training and understanding
[53:50.480 --> 53:56.400]  in a kind of civil defense. That universal sense of service somewhere between ages 1825
[53:56.400 --> 54:01.600]  will give Americans, once again, a sense of what they are to be American and their contribution
[54:01.600 --> 54:06.800]  to a country and a common experience. And you look at World War II, and that was a draft.
[54:06.800 --> 54:13.600]  This is not a draft. It's a universal service. It is not an accident that we started our big march
[54:14.240 --> 54:19.920]  towards civil rights and expanding post-World War II because the country came through an experience
[54:19.920 --> 54:26.320]  together. So is this compulsory then? Well, you have to, in a sense, it's a requirement of everybody.
[54:26.960 --> 54:31.920]  1825, three months. Because I think anytime somebody serves their country in some capacity,
[54:31.920 --> 54:38.560]  we're going to be stronger for it. And he goes on in his book saying,
[54:38.560 --> 54:54.000]  we've got to have a civilian national security force. Now, living in the USSR,
[54:54.000 --> 55:00.960]  back in the USSR, you don't know how lucky you are. This is the new civil rights. And in his book,
[55:00.960 --> 55:05.680]  and then in the four bills they've introduced, we barely got it stripped down where it would
[55:05.680 --> 55:11.200]  automatically say all high school kids, including homeschool, have to serve starting in junior high
[55:11.200 --> 55:16.880]  from eighth grade to when they get out of then two years of college, three months. And by the way,
[55:16.880 --> 55:22.400]  that clip we found on YouTube that Kurt linked to in the article, that's nothing. On YouTube and
[55:22.400 --> 55:27.520]  Google, there's the whole C-SPAN interview where he says, yes, you'll be in uniforms. You'll do
[55:27.520 --> 55:34.080]  jumping jacks. You'll get up at 6 a.m. I mean, this is you hurting. Compulsory required. Now,
[55:34.080 --> 55:44.720]  here's media matters. Media matters says that none of this exists. In fact,
[55:45.360 --> 55:48.880]  part of what I want you to do is I want you to go to the info wars article, media matters,
[55:48.880 --> 55:53.280]  hit piece, and you can just link through to the Oliver Williams story. And then that'll be the
[55:53.280 --> 55:57.040]  current one. I want people to actually see, because we're also simulcasting right now,
[55:57.040 --> 56:01.680]  prisonplanet.tv, if you're a radio listener and you keep hearing me say, I want people to see this.
[56:01.680 --> 56:07.760]  That's what's so great about this being in a TV station format, radio slash TV is I can
[56:07.760 --> 56:12.240]  show people this who are watching at prisonplanet.tv. And then it's ripped the four winds on the
[56:12.240 --> 56:18.800]  internet while it's still open and free for a few years, maybe, maybe more before the government
[56:18.800 --> 56:24.480]  launches a false flag on the internet and shuts it down in the name of saving it. But
[56:26.640 --> 56:30.960]  yeah, Glenn Beck mainstream fringe conspiracy theories. And then it goes on to say Glenn Beck
[56:30.960 --> 56:35.840]  copies me, which is the only truthful thing in this whole article and talks about the delusions
[56:35.840 --> 56:42.160]  that I've been warning about for years of forced national conscription and paramilitary teams.
[56:42.160 --> 56:48.800]  All I'm doing is reading the bills. In fact, I didn't even print this for the show today.
[56:48.800 --> 56:53.680]  Google this next Hartman for people out there listening to it yourselves. New bill
[56:53.680 --> 57:01.520]  forces national service. New bill has and then I'll give you the latest bill number.
[57:01.520 --> 57:11.040]  They passed one, they passed a bill two months ago that says that they're setting up the federal
[57:11.040 --> 57:17.440]  agency to set up the compulsory service. But they got other bills in there that state it
[57:17.440 --> 57:21.040]  will be compulsory service. And you just heard the White House chief of staff. You just heard
[57:21.040 --> 57:28.480]  Obama. Now again, they think you're stupid when media matters puts up articles. I mean,
[57:28.480 --> 57:33.040]  it's media matters that says Rush Limbaugh is a liar. And I got to tell you, I read media
[57:33.040 --> 57:37.360]  matters every week to see what they're up to over the last decade. 90 plus percent of the time
[57:37.360 --> 57:42.160]  they're lying about Rush Limbaugh and Rush Limbaugh is telling the truth. Let me tell you what Rush
[57:42.160 --> 57:48.480]  Limbaugh lies about. He lies about the Republican party being good. He lies about them not tripling
[57:48.480 --> 57:53.200]  the size of government. He lies about how they're going to save us and how the war on terror is real.
[57:54.720 --> 57:59.280]  But he tells the truth about big government and gun grabbing and open borders. And that's why they
[57:59.280 --> 58:05.280]  don't like him because compared to George Soros and David Rockefeller, Rush Limbaugh is a great guy.
[58:05.280 --> 58:11.440]  That's why they don't like him because he's not totally sold out to the New World Order. He doesn't
[58:11.440 --> 58:16.160]  fit into their program. We're going to come back after the news. I'm going to finish up with this
[58:16.160 --> 58:20.320]  and then start taking your phone calls. Our phone system's down for some reason. That's fine. I can
[58:20.320 --> 58:25.360]  talk for 10 hours. You know that, folks. We'll be right back. Stay with us. Prisonplanet.tv.
[58:25.360 --> 58:30.320]  We're live streaming TV right now. We're going to let you hear what Limbaugh has to say about this
[58:30.320 --> 58:35.520]  with Glenn Beck on the other side. Sounds like the Alex Jones show. And Michael Savage says,
[58:35.520 --> 58:40.160]  Obama's going to stage terror attacks. And I agree with him. That's the only way this criminal is
[58:40.160 --> 58:45.360]  going to get what he wants. Stay with us. The truth is coming out. The people are waking up.

[1:01:05.480 --> 1:01:10.280]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[1:01:10.280 --> 1:01:11.280]  You want answers?
[1:01:11.280 --> 1:01:13.480]  Well, so does he.
[1:01:13.480 --> 1:01:17.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[1:01:17.640 --> 1:01:25.000]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  You know, there's a reason I have continually told my people since we're doing my show
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:38.840]  on the studio, Genesis has T1 phone lines that go over the computer down a couple times
[1:01:38.840 --> 1:01:40.240]  every month.
[1:01:40.240 --> 1:01:41.800]  We have that system.
[1:01:41.800 --> 1:01:44.800]  We need regular phone lines as a backup.
[1:01:44.800 --> 1:01:50.000]  And people look at me like I've got, you know, like I'm like I'm a 14 headed green space
[1:01:50.000 --> 1:01:51.600]  alien around here.
[1:01:51.600 --> 1:01:55.240]  But so no phone calls today here on the show.
[1:01:55.240 --> 1:02:00.400]  But Hermes is coming up, they should have it fixed by then, phone companies having to
[1:02:00.400 --> 1:02:01.400]  do something.
[1:02:01.400 --> 1:02:02.400]  So whatever.
[1:02:02.400 --> 1:02:03.400]  I really, you know, whatever.
[1:02:03.400 --> 1:02:04.400]  Frankly, I could talk 100 hours.
[1:02:04.400 --> 1:02:05.400]  So I'm actually happy in a sick way.
[1:02:05.400 --> 1:02:08.600]  Though I do like to hear from the listeners in different directions they take us in.
[1:02:08.600 --> 1:02:10.640]  I got a bunch of flu news coming up.
[1:02:10.640 --> 1:02:11.840]  Very important.
[1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:13.800]  It's not enough to have level six with the flu.
[1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:19.160]  Now they're going above that to increase the pheromongering, bunch of new important pieces
[1:02:19.160 --> 1:02:20.800]  of information there.
[1:02:20.800 --> 1:02:28.640]  Please tell Swedish TV, World Health Organization, pandemic criteria lowered to benefit big pharma.
[1:02:28.640 --> 1:02:33.320]  See, that's why they're announcing global pandemic when it's not really a pandemic
[1:02:33.320 --> 1:02:35.560]  is so they can take your liberties away.
[1:02:35.560 --> 1:02:39.240]  It's not just about making money, though they like making money while they dominate you.
[1:02:39.240 --> 1:02:43.760]  It's all about the power because you got the power, you got the money and you got the
[1:02:43.760 --> 1:02:49.320]  money, you get the woman like Tony Montana says also a flu shot or get fired.
[1:02:49.320 --> 1:02:55.480]  It's coming out all over the world times union reports on this Texas adult protective services
[1:02:55.480 --> 1:02:59.440]  kidnapping elderly couples and then of course, sucking their bank accounts dry.
[1:02:59.440 --> 1:03:04.000]  It's all part of the government off because you got to give the tens of trillions to the
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.240]  foreign offshore banks.
[1:03:05.240 --> 1:03:08.480]  I mean, that's essential to do.
[1:03:08.480 --> 1:03:17.880]  It's essential to get that job done and we're also going to get into this, this whole act
[1:03:17.880 --> 1:03:20.800]  where Obama says I'm going to release the torture photos and a month later says he's
[1:03:20.800 --> 1:03:21.800]  not going to.
[1:03:21.800 --> 1:03:26.040]  I'm going to prosecute these guys that were threatening to use electric drills on people.
[1:03:26.040 --> 1:03:27.640]  That's a diversion from all the real torture.
[1:03:27.640 --> 1:03:32.560]  We're going to go over that bunch of economic news.
[1:03:32.560 --> 1:03:38.000]  But this is a big deal with media matters going after us.
[1:03:38.000 --> 1:03:47.600]  This is a big deal with mainstream media attacking us and these big foundations.
[1:03:47.600 --> 1:03:49.520]  I mean, these foundations are the new world order.
[1:03:49.520 --> 1:03:52.800]  This is how they buy off politicians, put out their propaganda.
[1:03:52.800 --> 1:03:57.840]  It is the foundations, the Rockefeller foundations and others that openly own and run NPR and
[1:03:57.840 --> 1:04:02.240]  actually make profits for themselves off of it.
[1:04:02.240 --> 1:04:06.600]  A lot of the PBS stations, almost the entire radio network.
[1:04:06.600 --> 1:04:11.000]  And so they're going to have a tax now on talk radio that goes to them.
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:14.640]  This is how the sick game works.
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:16.800]  This is how they operate.
[1:04:16.800 --> 1:04:21.120]  This is how they get their job done.
[1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:25.640]  And we'll be talking more about this tomorrow because they're coming out in the open saying
[1:04:25.640 --> 1:04:30.400]  they want to censor talk radio, censor the internet, federally take over the internet.
[1:04:30.400 --> 1:04:34.120]  And then every time we say, hey, we don't want national compulsory service or for you to
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:37.360]  take the internet over, they go, what are you talking about conspiracy theorist?
[1:04:37.360 --> 1:04:39.960]  And we're like, well, here's your bill.
[1:04:39.960 --> 1:04:42.320]  They go, you're a crazy man.
[1:04:42.320 --> 1:04:43.520]  There's no Congress.
[1:04:43.520 --> 1:04:44.520]  There's no bill.
[1:04:44.520 --> 1:04:46.160]  I mean, I expect them to say that.
[1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:47.680]  It's like, you don't exist.
[1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:48.680]  You're going crazy.
[1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:53.960]  I mean, you know, they, they play these mind games with us.
[1:04:53.960 --> 1:04:58.240]  And I for one have had enough of these mind games, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:04:58.240 --> 1:05:03.600]  So we're going to come back and play this clip of Limbaugh and Beck and then try to analyze
[1:05:03.600 --> 1:05:08.440]  why is the media attacking them and the big foundations attacking them, but then mixing
[1:05:08.440 --> 1:05:09.440]  me in.
[1:05:09.440 --> 1:05:15.840]  I mean, I'm not as big as Glenn Beck or Rush Limbaugh, though, virally on the internet,
[1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:18.280]  I'm actually bigger than Limbaugh and Beck overseas.
[1:05:18.280 --> 1:05:24.520]  That's you can look at that on the Alexa ratings and different web ratings, but my growth curve
[1:05:24.520 --> 1:05:29.480]  is to eclipse them within two or three years if I continue to grow like this.
[1:05:29.480 --> 1:05:37.000]  But still, Beck's probably double the audience I have Limbaugh's probably more than double.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.400]  My audience is different though.
[1:05:38.400 --> 1:05:43.720]  It's not a bunch of, you know, Glenn Beck is a meddling Limbaugh, a lot of geriatric folks,
[1:05:43.720 --> 1:05:49.160]  which are great people, but you know, on average, their blisters viewers are about 75 to 80.
[1:05:49.160 --> 1:05:52.600]  I have the young people and that scares the control left.
[1:05:52.600 --> 1:05:59.880]  So we'll explain all that too when we get back, stay with us.
[1:05:59.880 --> 1:06:04.280]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:06:04.280 --> 1:06:05.280]  this summer.
[1:06:05.280 --> 1:06:09.160]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:06:09.160 --> 1:06:14.080]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[1:06:14.080 --> 1:06:15.080]  you to have.
[1:06:15.080 --> 1:06:20.120]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:06:20.120 --> 1:06:24.720]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially
[1:06:24.720 --> 1:06:26.640]  with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:06:26.640 --> 1:06:30.200]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:06:30.200 --> 1:06:33.840]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:38.680]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:06:38.680 --> 1:06:43.120]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solution from science, a long time
[1:06:43.120 --> 1:06:44.280]  sponsor of ours.
[1:06:44.280 --> 1:06:49.040]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[1:06:49.040 --> 1:06:50.680]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[1:06:50.680 --> 1:06:53.320]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[1:07:01.960 --> 1:07:08.520]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:14.600]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[1:07:14.600 --> 1:07:18.640]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central standard time, ladies and gentlemen,
[1:07:18.640 --> 1:07:19.640]  I am live.
[1:07:19.640 --> 1:07:23.640]  When we come back Sunday, it's 4 to 6 p.m.
[1:07:23.640 --> 1:07:28.480]  All right, let me continue here.
[1:07:28.480 --> 1:07:34.560]  So you got Rush Limbaugh, 22 million listeners, conservatively millions more on the internet,
[1:07:34.560 --> 1:07:35.960]  but rated 22 million.
[1:07:35.960 --> 1:07:43.640]  Glenn Beck, 10 million on the radio, 5 million every week or so, tune in.
[1:07:43.640 --> 1:07:48.960]  Why am I being lumped in with him constantly when both Limbaugh and Beck have attacked
[1:07:48.960 --> 1:07:51.280]  me repeatedly on radio?
[1:07:51.280 --> 1:07:55.040]  I don't think Beck's ever talked about me specifically, but he's talked about groups
[1:07:55.040 --> 1:07:59.920]  I founded constantly on TV and called for our arrest.
[1:07:59.920 --> 1:08:03.880]  And I told you six months before he went, he said, I'm going to expose in a few months
[1:08:03.880 --> 1:08:09.680]  was about six months ago, but it was about two or three months before he did it.
[1:08:09.680 --> 1:08:11.480]  He said, I think FEMA camps are real.
[1:08:11.480 --> 1:08:12.480]  I'm going to get to the bottom of it.
[1:08:12.480 --> 1:08:16.760]  And I said, he will go show the Indiana train station.
[1:08:16.760 --> 1:08:20.800]  That's an Amtrak station is clearly not a FEMA camp, but he won't cover the civilian
[1:08:20.800 --> 1:08:25.480]  inmate labor camp program or the bills to expand the camps or all the admissions or
[1:08:25.480 --> 1:08:30.480]  Rex 84, the Miami Herald or the Houston Chronicle or the New York Times or open it.
[1:08:30.480 --> 1:08:32.760]  No, no, he's going to go to a strong man and discredit.
[1:08:32.760 --> 1:08:35.360]  And they said, Oh, Alex, leave back alone.
[1:08:35.360 --> 1:08:36.360]  He's a good guy.
[1:08:36.360 --> 1:08:38.480]  You know, he talks about the new world order.
[1:08:38.480 --> 1:08:41.800]  Yeah, but he acts like it's something the Democrats are doing.
[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:45.160]  And as long as you only make it about the Democrats, then it could still be a left
[1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:46.160]  right issue.
[1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:50.120]  And they control people by keeping them on the right wing, fake reservation instead of
[1:08:50.120 --> 1:08:52.760]  just waking up and saying, I'm somebody who wants freedom.
[1:08:52.760 --> 1:08:56.880]  Both parties are controlled, abolish the fellow reserve, arrest the bankers that have run
[1:08:56.880 --> 1:08:58.760]  the scam.
[1:08:58.760 --> 1:09:00.840]  Okay.
[1:09:00.840 --> 1:09:03.960]  So why is media matters?
[1:09:03.960 --> 1:09:09.000]  And why is George Soros and daily costs and alternate and all these Rockefeller acorn
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:12.120]  founded fund foundations, they openly are founded by that.
[1:09:12.120 --> 1:09:17.040]  Why are they out saying that there's no such thing as national compulsory service when
[1:09:17.040 --> 1:09:21.960]  I can read from the bills, the White House's own publications, Obama clips and Rahm Emanuel
[1:09:21.960 --> 1:09:22.960]  clips.
[1:09:22.960 --> 1:09:23.960]  I could play them for hours.
[1:09:23.960 --> 1:09:24.960]  There's so many.
[1:09:24.960 --> 1:09:28.200]  And we just played two of them last hour.
[1:09:28.200 --> 1:09:31.040]  There it is house passes mandatory national service bill.
[1:09:31.040 --> 1:09:37.520]  You scroll down on that article and it's got all the links right there.
[1:09:37.520 --> 1:09:41.840]  Generations invigorating volunteerism and education act known as the give act was passed
[1:09:41.840 --> 1:09:48.840]  321 to 105 margin sets up a federal body to prepare national compulsory service.
[1:09:48.840 --> 1:09:51.440]  It had the compulsory service in it.
[1:09:51.440 --> 1:09:52.560]  We got it stripped.
[1:09:52.560 --> 1:09:55.760]  So they said, we'll set up an agency with the power to do it.
[1:09:55.760 --> 1:09:56.760]  I mean, there's the bill.
[1:09:56.760 --> 1:09:59.720]  Got a link to it right there.
[1:09:59.720 --> 1:10:01.200]  But they're saying, I'm insane.
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:02.440]  I'm dangerous.
[1:10:02.440 --> 1:10:03.600]  It doesn't exist.
[1:10:03.600 --> 1:10:04.600]  Beck is dangerous.
[1:10:04.600 --> 1:10:05.600]  Doesn't exist.
[1:10:05.600 --> 1:10:13.400]  And you read the comments on the media matters article and it's like arrest them.
[1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:14.400]  They're all criminals.
[1:10:14.400 --> 1:10:22.160]  Arrest Limbaugh, arrest Alex, you know, arrest Beck.
[1:10:22.160 --> 1:10:24.480]  In fact, queue up Michael's saboteurs, a bunch of them.
[1:10:24.480 --> 1:10:29.200]  If you YouTube it, a bunch will come up, but savage says Obama to stage terror.
[1:10:29.200 --> 1:10:33.440]  I mean, let's play savage with 8 million listeners saying it.
[1:10:33.440 --> 1:10:39.320]  This is scaring the system because there is some industry, some money, some it's not totally
[1:10:39.320 --> 1:10:42.060]  controlled in the US.
[1:10:42.060 --> 1:10:48.720]  And there is a kind of Republican instinct to not totally have open government control
[1:10:48.720 --> 1:10:51.160]  and total police state.
[1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:55.480]  And so because Republicans are out of power, it's kind of time for them to play that part,
[1:10:55.480 --> 1:10:56.880]  the populist role.
[1:10:56.880 --> 1:10:58.200]  We do it no matter who's in office.
[1:10:58.200 --> 1:11:00.560]  We're nonpartisan.
[1:11:00.560 --> 1:11:05.000]  We're constitutionalist here, but they're mixing me in with Limbaugh and Beck because they're
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:11.120]  scared of all of us across the board.
[1:11:11.120 --> 1:11:15.360]  And they're particularly scared of me because I have the young demographic as well as the
[1:11:15.360 --> 1:11:16.800]  middle age and the old.
[1:11:16.800 --> 1:11:17.800]  I'm very diverse.
[1:11:17.800 --> 1:11:20.720]  I've got the left and the right waking up.
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:24.200]  And so while they're busy demonizing Limbaugh and Beck, who've got a lot more skeletons
[1:11:24.200 --> 1:11:29.720]  in their closet and problems, they can kind of mix me in and go after what they see as
[1:11:29.720 --> 1:11:33.280]  the real threat to their system.
[1:11:33.280 --> 1:11:36.560]  Because when they've got a fake right-wing savior in power who's going to keep all the
[1:11:36.560 --> 1:11:41.160]  bad stuff Obama does, just like Obama's keeping all the bad stuff Bush put in place, I'll
[1:11:41.160 --> 1:11:45.280]  be fighting it when Limbaugh and Beck are defending it, just like Keith Opperman would
[1:11:45.280 --> 1:11:49.440]  go after Bush for wanting to stage terror attacks on US ships.
[1:11:49.440 --> 1:11:54.040]  But as soon as Obama comes in, he won't talk about it.
[1:11:54.040 --> 1:12:02.360]  See, I'm not a political pundit with a dog in the fight when it comes to which party.
[1:12:02.360 --> 1:12:04.960]  I want my children to grow up in a free society.
[1:12:04.960 --> 1:12:09.240]  But anyways, it's creepy to have this type of powerful institutions attacking me.
[1:12:09.240 --> 1:12:12.200]  The biggest, most powerful, new order foundations.
[1:12:12.200 --> 1:12:14.440]  Now let's play Limbaugh and Beck.
[1:12:14.440 --> 1:12:16.360]  Beck, this is an amazing 10 minute clip.
[1:12:16.360 --> 1:12:19.960]  It's up on infowars.com, unedited, they have a link to the YouTube if you want to find
[1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:20.960]  it.
[1:12:20.960 --> 1:12:28.280]  But this is Limbaugh and Beck openly saying that Obama may stage something to go after
[1:12:28.280 --> 1:12:36.000]  people and that, oh, Rush, he blamed you for McVeigh, and Clinton blamed you for that.
[1:12:36.000 --> 1:12:39.840]  I mean, this is a big deal to have Limbaugh and Beck going this far.
[1:12:39.840 --> 1:12:41.520]  This is amazing.
[1:12:41.520 --> 1:12:45.120]  And they can tell folks that they're now in danger of being shut down.
[1:12:45.120 --> 1:12:47.160]  Let's go ahead and go to it.
[1:12:47.160 --> 1:12:48.560]  Here it is.
[1:12:48.560 --> 1:12:54.040]  Tomorrow on this program, I'm going to lay out the case of the Army that they are building
[1:12:54.040 --> 1:13:00.200]  right underneath our nose and an Army that he spoke about on the campaign trail.
[1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:07.920]  And if you watch what could only be called the organizations or the administration's
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:15.640]  organ, anything involved with GE or NBC, you've got now Jeffrey Immelt on the board of the
[1:13:15.640 --> 1:13:17.080]  Federal Reserve.
[1:13:17.080 --> 1:13:22.280]  You have him in the Oval Office consulting not only on healthcare but the financial situation.
[1:13:22.280 --> 1:13:23.800]  And they are an organ.
[1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:29.840]  If you watch MSNBC, I contend that you will see the future because they are laying the
[1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:36.840]  ground for a horrible event that will be, is what they're laying the ground for, anything
[1:13:36.840 --> 1:13:38.120]  from the right.
[1:13:38.120 --> 1:13:40.080]  They're some awful event.
[1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:47.360]  And I fear this government, this administration, has so much framework already prepared that
[1:13:47.360 --> 1:13:53.120]  they will seize power overnight before anybody even gives it a second thought.
[1:13:53.120 --> 1:13:58.000]  Well, I think because of what you're doing with your television show, your radio show,
[1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:00.440]  what we're all doing here, I don't think they're going to be able to seize it overnight
[1:14:00.440 --> 1:14:02.240]  without anybody knowing about it.
[1:14:02.240 --> 1:14:05.800]  And you talk about the organized groups that they've got.
[1:14:05.800 --> 1:14:11.440]  Look at the healthcare situation, what's happening right now, the genuine passion, the real passion
[1:14:11.440 --> 1:14:15.080]  is in individual Americans' hearts and minds.
[1:14:15.080 --> 1:14:16.080]  Individuals are showing up.
[1:14:16.080 --> 1:14:19.840]  They may be going to the web to find out where these town halls are, but they're showing
[1:14:19.840 --> 1:14:24.040]  up because individually they don't want any part of this.
[1:14:24.040 --> 1:14:26.560]  The Obama Army has to be bought and paid for.
[1:14:26.560 --> 1:14:29.560]  The Obama Army has to be bought and paid for.
[1:14:29.560 --> 1:14:33.120]  Again, everything Limbaugh is saying is totally true.
[1:14:33.120 --> 1:14:34.120]  And that's the thing.
[1:14:34.120 --> 1:14:39.600]  Compared to media matters, this guy is the bastion of truth and wisdom.
[1:14:39.600 --> 1:14:43.480]  I mean, he distorts stuff, he twists, but I mean, I listen to Limbaugh often on.
[1:14:43.480 --> 1:14:49.760]  It's nothing compared to media matters and George Soros saying there's no plan for national
[1:14:49.760 --> 1:14:50.960]  compulsory service.
[1:14:50.960 --> 1:14:54.960]  I just gave you bill numbers, the White House chief of staff and the president calling for
[1:14:54.960 --> 1:14:55.960]  it.
[1:14:55.960 --> 1:15:01.600]  And media matters knows that the big foundations want compulsory service or slavery, and they
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:07.840]  call it the new civil rights, and it's come out in Texas and all over, fake people posing
[1:15:07.840 --> 1:15:14.120]  as doctors on the White House payroll, not just with a foundation and all over the country.
[1:15:14.120 --> 1:15:22.520]  They got fake people and they, and Acorn and others have been advertising $500 to go to
[1:15:22.520 --> 1:15:25.360]  these events and to pose as a supporter.
[1:15:25.360 --> 1:15:30.820]  I mean, it's on record, they're the ones paying for the crowds.
[1:15:30.820 --> 1:15:33.960]  People know the government can't administer healthcare.
[1:15:33.960 --> 1:15:37.160]  Healthcare screwed up because government got their fat hands involved in it.
[1:15:37.160 --> 1:15:40.360]  And they go, oh, be compassionate and take care of people.
[1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:41.680]  It's a bunch of eugenicists.
[1:15:41.680 --> 1:15:45.280]  Tom Dashell wrote a book saying, don't give old people healthcare.
[1:15:45.280 --> 1:15:46.920]  In Europe, they do ration it.
[1:15:46.920 --> 1:15:47.920]  They are eugenicists.
[1:15:47.920 --> 1:15:49.600]  They do want you to die.
[1:15:49.600 --> 1:15:52.000]  The bioethics boards are death panels.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:54.320]  You lying trash.
[1:15:54.320 --> 1:15:56.120]  I'm sick of your crap.
[1:15:56.120 --> 1:15:57.120]  I am, man.
[1:15:57.120 --> 1:15:58.280]  I'm sick of it.
[1:15:58.280 --> 1:16:06.040]  Go back to pillhead, he's telling the truth, which is healthcare.
[1:16:06.040 --> 1:16:09.120]  They're showing up because they've been instructed to buy bosses.
[1:16:09.120 --> 1:16:12.640]  Now they, they, they, this army that you're going to reveal tomorrow is probably going
[1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:13.640]  to be much the same way.
[1:16:13.640 --> 1:16:19.440]  And I'm going to tell you something, Glenn, passion, love of country, truth is going to
[1:16:19.440 --> 1:16:25.800]  outmaneuver and overpower fake passion, trumped up people who were just given marching orders
[1:16:25.800 --> 1:16:28.560]  and, and, and sent out to act in a certain way.
[1:16:28.560 --> 1:16:34.800]  Uh, I, I really, I'm, you know, we may be looking at Barack Obama destroying the Democrat
[1:16:34.800 --> 1:16:35.800]  party.
[1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:38.680]  It's too soon to say that now, but we may be looking at that happen.
[1:16:38.680 --> 1:16:39.680]  There are reasons.
[1:16:39.680 --> 1:16:40.680]  Okay.
[1:16:40.680 --> 1:16:43.920]  They talk about stage terror attacks, everything else.
[1:16:43.920 --> 1:16:46.800]  We're forcing the mainstream to talk about these issues.
[1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:48.640]  There's obviously a fissure within the elite.
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:52.280]  That's why they're letting Limbaugh and Beck do this because there's a lot of people in
[1:16:52.280 --> 1:16:55.760]  the power structure going, are we going to really be like Nazi Germany?
[1:16:55.760 --> 1:16:56.760]  It's Mao Zedong.
[1:16:56.760 --> 1:17:00.720]  I mean, are we really going to let this happen?
[1:17:00.720 --> 1:17:02.080]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:17:02.080 --> 1:17:04.080]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[1:17:04.080 --> 1:17:05.080]  Well, you should.
[1:17:05.080 --> 1:17:09.600]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[1:17:09.600 --> 1:17:10.600]  That's right.
[1:17:10.600 --> 1:17:15.400]  You can attend five days of world class gun training at front site firearms training
[1:17:15.400 --> 1:17:20.280]  institute and secure a 30 state concealed weapons permit all for pennies on the dollar.
[1:17:20.280 --> 1:17:25.640]  Plus, if you act fast, the millionaire patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD
[1:17:25.640 --> 1:17:27.560]  medal in the caliber of your choice.
[1:17:27.560 --> 1:17:31.640]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[1:17:31.640 --> 1:17:34.720]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[1:17:34.720 --> 1:17:39.120]  Front site provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[1:17:39.120 --> 1:17:40.200]  attitudes.
[1:17:40.200 --> 1:17:41.720]  This is real.
[1:17:41.720 --> 1:17:43.000]  Don't miss out.
[1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:48.360]  Secure a front site defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit
[1:17:48.360 --> 1:17:51.160]  for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.
[1:17:51.160 --> 1:17:57.200]  Go to front site.com today, that's F-R-O-N-T-S-I-G-H-T.com.
[1:17:57.200 --> 1:18:01.360]  Go to front site.com for your training and free gun.
[1:18:01.360 --> 1:18:04.440]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:18:04.440 --> 1:18:08.800]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:18:08.800 --> 1:18:09.800]  do you want?
[1:18:09.800 --> 1:18:15.360]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:18:15.360 --> 1:18:16.840]  Food is your only ammunition.
[1:18:16.840 --> 1:18:18.080]  How much do you want?
[1:18:18.080 --> 1:18:19.160]  When do you want it?
[1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:21.080]  Now or after the battle starts?
[1:18:21.080 --> 1:18:22.200]  When will you need it?
[1:18:22.200 --> 1:18:24.320]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:25.680]  Will there be any food?
[1:18:25.680 --> 1:18:27.120]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:18:27.120 --> 1:18:31.280]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:18:31.280 --> 1:18:32.440]  and be immunized?
[1:18:32.440 --> 1:18:36.240]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:18:36.240 --> 1:18:39.840]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:18:39.840 --> 1:18:41.040]  How much will you need?
[1:18:41.040 --> 1:18:42.040]  We don't know.
[1:18:42.040 --> 1:18:43.040]  How much do you want?
[1:18:43.040 --> 1:18:44.040]  All you can get.
[1:18:44.040 --> 1:18:45.040]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:18:45.040 --> 1:18:48.240]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:56.240]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:19:00.440]  1-800-409-5633.
[1:19:00.440 --> 1:19:05.120]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:19:05.120 --> 1:19:06.120]  you to eat.
[1:19:06.120 --> 1:19:09.640]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[1:19:09.640 --> 1:19:10.640]  sick?
[1:19:10.640 --> 1:19:12.560]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[1:19:12.560 --> 1:19:14.240]  You don't have to cooperate.
[1:19:14.240 --> 1:19:15.560]  There is a solution.

[1:20:00.440 --> 1:20:04.280]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:20:04.280 --> 1:20:06.640]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[1:20:06.640 --> 1:20:12.240]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[1:20:12.240 --> 1:20:15.280]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:20:15.280 --> 1:20:19.400]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental
[1:20:19.400 --> 1:20:20.400]  system diseases.
[1:20:20.400 --> 1:20:22.560]  Now, what are you going to do about it?
[1:20:22.560 --> 1:20:27.320]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[1:20:27.320 --> 1:20:29.080]  you and your family's drinking water.
[1:20:29.080 --> 1:20:33.800]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[1:20:33.800 --> 1:20:39.200]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization
[1:20:39.200 --> 1:20:40.200]  techniques.

[1:20:58.240 --> 1:21:18.240]  All right, good news, they got the ridiculous phone system back up and working, happens
[1:21:18.240 --> 1:21:19.240]  a couple times a year.
[1:21:19.240 --> 1:21:24.240]  This office looks like the Jawa Landcrawler on the inside of it.
[1:21:24.240 --> 1:21:35.040]  888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244 are locally in Central, Texas for listening
[1:21:35.040 --> 1:21:47.360]  on, say, 590 a.m., A.L.B.J., to say it properly, News Radio 590 K.L.B.J., 512-646-1776.
[1:21:47.360 --> 1:21:52.960]  The word 1776 offends you, I'm sorry, the George Soros has brainwashed you.
[1:21:52.960 --> 1:21:58.080]  So Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck talking about stage terror attacks, do you, and then we're
[1:21:58.080 --> 1:22:03.000]  going to your phone calls, do you have the clip of Savage, are you able to pull that
[1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:04.000]  up quickly?
[1:22:04.000 --> 1:22:06.720]  I know I've got one guy in here today doing the job of three people.
[1:22:06.720 --> 1:22:07.720]  We'll pull it up later.
[1:22:07.720 --> 1:22:08.720]  Yeah, yeah.
[1:22:08.720 --> 1:22:13.480]  I mean, the point is, is that the things I've talked about for 14 years being laughed at
[1:22:13.480 --> 1:22:17.600]  are now mainstream news and the establishment doesn't like that.
[1:22:17.600 --> 1:22:23.040]  Some of the other news, while we're queuing that up, I want to hear from listeners about,
[1:22:23.040 --> 1:22:25.120]  I mean, what does this mean for this show?
[1:22:25.120 --> 1:22:31.660]  It's got me looking over my back to have media matters attacking me and all these George
[1:22:31.660 --> 1:22:37.920]  Soros, Rockefeller, government fronts, I mean, they admit these are run by the security
[1:22:37.920 --> 1:22:48.840]  council, by the state department, by spooks, by the government, and the government launderers
[1:22:48.840 --> 1:22:53.160]  money through these foundations and through Acorn and then they launder it back out in
[1:22:53.160 --> 1:22:54.160]  the media.
[1:22:54.160 --> 1:22:59.680]  Now they're going to have a tax of all internet, of all internet, AM and FM radio.
[1:22:59.680 --> 1:23:02.320]  They're now seeing FCC is going to be over the web.
[1:23:02.320 --> 1:23:07.520]  I mean, the FCC can go jump off a cliff if they start trying to regulate free speech
[1:23:07.520 --> 1:23:08.520]  on the web.
[1:23:08.520 --> 1:23:09.640]  I mean, I'm just sick of it.
[1:23:09.640 --> 1:23:11.000]  I'm sick of it.
[1:23:11.000 --> 1:23:16.480]  Get off my back, parasites, I can't take any more and the people can't take any more.
[1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:22.840]  Then I've got all this other news, hospitals gear up for flu epidemic and they're saying
[1:23:22.840 --> 1:23:25.800]  it's above a level six, a level six was the highest.
[1:23:25.800 --> 1:23:30.320]  It's like the color coded reds, the highest, are they going to go to purple level?
[1:23:30.320 --> 1:23:31.880]  They've done that.
[1:23:31.880 --> 1:23:35.840]  Scientists tells Swedish TV, World Health Organization, pandemic criteria, lower to
[1:23:35.840 --> 1:23:40.080]  benefit big pharma, flu shot or get fired.
[1:23:40.080 --> 1:23:43.640]  That's being announced all over the country in the world.
[1:23:43.640 --> 1:23:46.440]  So we're going to go over all of those reports after I take some phone calls.
[1:23:46.440 --> 1:23:50.800]  But here's Michael Savage saying Obama's going to stage a terror attack.
[1:23:50.800 --> 1:23:52.160]  And I agree with him.
[1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:57.200]  If Obama doesn't stage a terror attack like Bush did, that is the people handling Bush
[1:23:57.200 --> 1:23:58.200]  and Obama.
[1:23:58.200 --> 1:23:59.200]  It's way above them.
[1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:00.200]  Then it's over.
[1:24:00.200 --> 1:24:02.800]  In fact, I haven't checked in a week.
[1:24:02.800 --> 1:24:04.800]  What's the Rasmussen daily tracker?
[1:24:04.800 --> 1:24:09.880]  It was 41 last Sunday and he was losing on average a point and a half a week.
[1:24:09.880 --> 1:24:11.280]  Was it 39?
[1:24:11.280 --> 1:24:17.720]  Is that possible lowest ever for any president eight months in?
[1:24:17.720 --> 1:24:19.440]  Let's go ahead and play the savage clip.
[1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:21.440]  Here it is.
[1:24:21.440 --> 1:24:23.000]  Now I'll make another prediction.
[1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:28.960]  I predict that very soon Obama will create a crisis along the lines of the Reichstag
[1:24:28.960 --> 1:24:29.960]  fire.
[1:24:29.960 --> 1:24:34.720]  I don't know what form it will take, but I believe that once the minions are seen for
[1:24:34.720 --> 1:24:39.760]  what they are, Ramman Manuel and his gang will set off a Reichstag fire in this country
[1:24:39.760 --> 1:24:44.680]  of some kind and they will recall the military dictatorship of Lincoln and Stanton during
[1:24:44.680 --> 1:24:49.000]  the Civil War when civilian suspects were arrested without warrant.
[1:24:49.000 --> 1:24:52.440]  I will tell you as I sit here, I fear that every night as I go to sleep.
[1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:53.440]  God, that's enough.
[1:24:53.440 --> 1:24:54.440]  But nothing.
[1:24:54.440 --> 1:24:55.440]  You can go listen to hours of it if you want.
[1:24:55.440 --> 1:24:59.760]  The issue here is, is that everybody's getting it.
[1:24:59.760 --> 1:25:04.680]  And now army manuals were declassified and we've listed the army number here.
[1:25:04.680 --> 1:25:09.960]  Before you can just search engine or start page.com's good search engine.
[1:25:09.960 --> 1:25:15.680]  You can just start page.com the term or Google the term army filled manual false flag and
[1:25:15.680 --> 1:25:20.080]  it tells the army blow up a school bus, shoot some people, blame it on your enemies.
[1:25:20.080 --> 1:25:21.080]  Works well.
[1:25:21.080 --> 1:25:22.080]  They're like, oh, little kids.
[1:25:22.080 --> 1:25:23.080]  I'm favorite.
[1:25:23.080 --> 1:25:25.680]  You know, that's, that's how you, that's how you roll.
[1:25:25.680 --> 1:25:30.560]  You splatter some kids up against the wall, hang grenade a school bus and you and the
[1:25:30.560 --> 1:25:34.400]  army's argument is, well, that helps us win the war and then that saves lives.
[1:25:34.400 --> 1:25:36.920]  It's called collateral damage.
[1:25:36.920 --> 1:25:47.840]  See generals for 5,000 years of recorded history have sent in, excuse me, generals for thousands
[1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:59.280]  of years have sent in what they call sacrificial forces or pawns, pawn sacrifice.
[1:25:59.280 --> 1:26:04.640]  And they stage terror attacks, that's the modern version, but before you would send in say
[1:26:04.640 --> 1:26:10.420]  with the cavalry, you'd send in a unit of a hundred guys into Apache infested territory
[1:26:10.420 --> 1:26:14.280]  knowing the Apaches are going to wipe them out.
[1:26:14.280 --> 1:26:18.280]  And the officer leading them in knows that try to hold out behind some rocks.
[1:26:18.280 --> 1:26:21.320]  You're probably all going to get killed, but we're all macho here.
[1:26:21.320 --> 1:26:22.320]  Yes, sir.
[1:26:22.320 --> 1:26:23.520]  I'm ready to die.
[1:26:23.520 --> 1:26:27.320]  And once you, I mean, look at the Alamo, they sent them down there saying you're probably
[1:26:27.320 --> 1:26:31.120]  going to get wiped out and then Travis said, we're probably all going to get killed, but
[1:26:31.120 --> 1:26:34.160]  this will help us get the state and they're like, hell, yeah, that sounds like a good
[1:26:34.160 --> 1:26:35.160]  way to die.
[1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:38.720]  I mean, these are, you know, so, so once you have that attitude, it's over.
[1:26:38.720 --> 1:26:42.560]  We're going to do it for America, blow up those towers and get tough.
[1:26:42.560 --> 1:26:43.560]  Yeah.
[1:26:43.560 --> 1:26:47.200]  The Muslim extremists, we've got to do it to get the American people to pay attention.
[1:26:47.200 --> 1:26:49.920]  Oh, you don't like hearing that.
[1:26:49.920 --> 1:26:52.240]  It doesn't fit in your left right paradigm.
[1:26:52.240 --> 1:26:57.120]  It's the facts, ladies and gentlemen, just like Northwood's call for hijacking Jetson
[1:26:57.120 --> 1:27:02.320]  bombing DC and crashing jets to blame it on foreign enemies, just like Gulf of Tonkin
[1:27:02.320 --> 1:27:07.520]  was stage, just like U.S. is Liberty was stage, just like Operation Ajax was staged.
[1:27:07.520 --> 1:27:14.440]  It's admitted that governments do this and they do not like Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck
[1:27:14.440 --> 1:27:18.480]  and Michael Savage coming out and saying, oh, bomb is going to stage this stuff to see
[1:27:18.480 --> 1:27:24.960]  what happened is back when I was exposing all of this, when it was a bush as the puppet,
[1:27:24.960 --> 1:27:30.880]  these guys hated me and attacked me, but now that Obama's in there, they are so partisan
[1:27:30.880 --> 1:27:33.600]  that they are actually telling the truth.
[1:27:33.600 --> 1:27:35.640]  And I think it's a beautiful thing.
[1:27:35.640 --> 1:27:40.440]  And I think it says that the kind of phony right wing edifice has more credibility and
[1:27:40.440 --> 1:27:47.000]  more guts in it than the fake foundation left does because you would never hear the left,
[1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:50.400]  the main line left agreeing that 9 11 was an inside job.
[1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:55.200]  In fact, that pig creature, Ed Schultz and the rest of them would get up there and attack
[1:27:55.200 --> 1:27:56.200]  me every week.
[1:27:56.200 --> 1:28:00.400]  And they would call to have Mike Malloy fired off of Air America, which they did because
[1:28:00.400 --> 1:28:03.400]  Mike Malloy was the only host on there that would tell the truth.
[1:28:03.400 --> 1:28:10.480]  So I respecting, I'll tell you something too, Daniel Ellsberg, I can tell you believe who
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:11.480]  I got.
[1:28:11.480 --> 1:28:15.320]  This is even believe who I got this from says he hates Obama because he's a total fraud,
[1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:22.360]  a corporate shell, see a real, see, I can respect somebody, even if I disagree with them
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:25.560]  like a congressman, Cassinage, I don't agree with a lot of things he's for.
[1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:29.920]  I agree with some of it, but I like him because he's for real and believes he's helping the
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:32.560]  people and will tell you what he really thinks.
[1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:35.280]  And I've got to tell you, I'm trying to figure this out.
[1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:36.720]  Why is Limba telling the truth?
[1:28:36.720 --> 1:28:38.320]  Why is Glenn Beck telling the truth?
[1:28:38.320 --> 1:28:45.280]  Why is, I don't think Savage is an operative Limba, I just think is a creature of the system
[1:28:45.280 --> 1:28:46.280]  Beck.
[1:28:46.280 --> 1:28:48.160]  I know is an operative.
[1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:55.920]  I mean, I predicted what he's going to do before.
[1:28:55.920 --> 1:29:02.480]  So it is just, it is just off the charts here, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening and
[1:29:02.480 --> 1:29:04.800]  it is real.
[1:29:04.800 --> 1:29:11.960]  So we're going to go to break, come back and for two segments, take your calls 888-201-2244
[1:29:11.960 --> 1:29:16.680]  or 512-646-1776 and I will try to refrain and just shut up and take your calls because
[1:29:16.680 --> 1:29:18.200]  I want to get your response to this.
[1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:23.520]  I mean, the feds are saying they're taking over the entire internet and local ISPs will
[1:29:23.520 --> 1:29:29.520]  have local federally certified commas are political officers over you.
[1:29:29.520 --> 1:29:33.800]  Just like China internet police that are a private corporate privatized force.
[1:29:33.800 --> 1:29:37.240]  I mean, that's the bill.
[1:29:37.240 --> 1:29:42.520]  This is really going on, but only emergency control, but the feds will be hooked into
[1:29:42.520 --> 1:29:44.600]  all your local servers.
[1:29:44.600 --> 1:29:51.280]  So we're going to come back over your calls and then get into some flu news and some
[1:29:51.280 --> 1:29:53.400]  brief economic news as well.
[1:29:53.400 --> 1:29:57.200]  Again, the websites are prisonplanet.tv and infowars.com.
[1:29:57.200 --> 1:30:00.960]  Stay with us.
[1:30:00.960 --> 1:30:02.320]  This is Alex Jones.
[1:30:02.320 --> 1:30:04.320]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?

[1:30:27.840 --> 1:30:31.920]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[1:30:31.920 --> 1:30:34.960]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[1:30:34.960 --> 1:30:39.400]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor

[1:31:01.400 --> 1:31:04.760]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider.
[1:31:04.760 --> 1:31:08.520]  Starting a solar power generator this summer, number one, new climate legislation could
[1:31:08.520 --> 1:31:10.700]  easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:31:10.700 --> 1:31:15.260]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:31:15.260 --> 1:31:16.520]  allows you to have.
[1:31:16.520 --> 1:31:17.520]  It's true.
[1:31:17.520 --> 1:31:21.680]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:31:21.680 --> 1:31:25.720]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[1:31:25.720 --> 1:31:28.200]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:31:28.200 --> 1:31:31.760]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:31:31.760 --> 1:31:35.400]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[1:31:35.400 --> 1:31:40.000]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:44.080]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:31:44.080 --> 1:31:45.760]  a longtime sponsor of ours.

[1:32:01.760 --> 1:32:04.760]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:32:04.760 --> 1:32:09.100]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:32:09.100 --> 1:32:10.100]  do you want?
[1:32:10.100 --> 1:32:15.640]  My answer would be all I can get in the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones.
[1:32:15.640 --> 1:32:17.120]  Food is your only ammunition.
[1:32:17.120 --> 1:32:18.360]  How much do you want?
[1:32:18.360 --> 1:32:19.360]  When do you want it?
[1:32:19.360 --> 1:32:21.400]  Now or after the battle starts?
[1:32:21.400 --> 1:32:22.520]  When will you need it?
[1:32:22.520 --> 1:32:24.640]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:32:24.640 --> 1:32:26.000]  Will there be any food?
[1:32:26.000 --> 1:32:27.440]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:32:27.440 --> 1:32:31.600]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:32:31.600 --> 1:32:32.760]  and be immunized?
[1:32:32.760 --> 1:32:36.520]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:32:36.520 --> 1:32:40.120]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:32:40.120 --> 1:32:41.360]  How much will you need?
[1:32:41.360 --> 1:32:42.360]  We don't know.
[1:32:42.360 --> 1:32:43.360]  How much do you want?
[1:32:43.360 --> 1:32:44.360]  All you can get.
[1:32:44.360 --> 1:32:45.360]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:32:45.360 --> 1:32:53.040]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day, call 1-800-409-5633 or check it
[1:32:53.040 --> 1:33:00.960]  out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com, again that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[1:33:00.960 --> 1:33:04.880]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones and I want each of you to ask yourself this question.
[1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:07.160]  Do you really know what's in your tap water?
[1:33:07.160 --> 1:33:12.800]  In a recent study conducted by a major environmental auditor, they found that over 260 chemicals
[1:33:12.800 --> 1:33:15.800]  in pollutants are present in municipal drinking water.
[1:33:15.800 --> 1:33:19.920]  Many of these chemicals are directly linked to cancer, reproductive, immune and developmental
[1:33:19.920 --> 1:33:21.240]  system diseases.
[1:33:21.240 --> 1:33:23.120]  Now what are you going to do about it?
[1:33:23.120 --> 1:33:27.880]  The Acola Blue Atmospheric Water Generator is a low-cost way to take back control of
[1:33:27.880 --> 1:33:29.640]  you and your family's drinking water.
[1:33:29.640 --> 1:33:34.360]  The Acola Blue 28 produces up to 7 gallons of water from the humidity in the atmosphere
[1:33:34.360 --> 1:33:39.760]  and uses state-of-the-art carbon filtration, reverse osmosis and ultra-violent light sterilization
[1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:40.760]  techniques.
[1:33:40.760 --> 1:33:44.120]  That's right, clean water right from the air you breathe.
[1:33:44.120 --> 1:33:53.120]  Remember today, by calling 1-800-691-6043, that's 1-800-691-6043 or visit Acola Blue on the
[1:33:53.120 --> 1:34:13.320]  web at www.ecoloblu.com today, that's acolablue.com.
[1:34:13.320 --> 1:34:17.680]  We are back live, London Guardian just in.
[1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:23.200]  The opposition party, the Democratic Party of Japan, 54 years out of power.
[1:34:23.200 --> 1:34:29.640]  They are now in power and their number two guy is a 9-11 truther and fan of this show
[1:34:29.640 --> 1:34:34.200]  and has brought up the fact that the attacks of 9-11 were an inside job and played our
[1:34:34.200 --> 1:34:37.280]  videos in the Japanese diet.
[1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:43.000]  So it's like having the vice president, let's get him on Fujita.
[1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:44.480]  Let's get him back on the show.
[1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:48.600]  I'll tell you, we're just having victory after victory against the New World Order.
[1:34:48.600 --> 1:34:51.760]  He's a really good guy.
[1:34:51.760 --> 1:34:57.560]  I got stories like sheriff teacher jailed for drug conspiracy in Texas, but why get into
[1:34:57.560 --> 1:34:58.560]  that?
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:04.160]  I'd say in East Texas and South Texas, more than half the sheriff's departments and police
[1:35:04.160 --> 1:35:06.840]  departments run the drugs.
[1:35:06.840 --> 1:35:09.480]  And if you come through their town and they find something wrong, they'll take your kids
[1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:11.160]  and sell them back to you.
[1:35:11.160 --> 1:35:15.960]  I mean, that's just how a thing government is run by a bunch of crooks.
[1:35:15.960 --> 1:35:19.720]  What is it you soft people out there haven't figured out yet?
[1:35:19.720 --> 1:35:22.840]  We've got hardcore crooks running our society.
[1:35:22.840 --> 1:35:28.080]  We better get control fast or it'll be like the Soviet Union.
[1:35:28.080 --> 1:35:32.120]  But I know you're not going to listen till it happens to you, so go ahead.
[1:35:32.120 --> 1:35:35.200]  You watch a lot of you are going to have your kids lining up in compulsory service.
[1:35:35.200 --> 1:35:39.160]  You'll be like, yeah, the conspiracy theorist said this was going to happen, but I actually
[1:35:39.160 --> 1:35:40.160]  like it.
[1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:44.000]  You know, I mean, it just, look, I'm not trying to be mean to my general audience, but people
[1:35:44.000 --> 1:35:47.800]  who are in denial out there, I don't know what to say to you.
[1:35:47.800 --> 1:35:50.640]  All right, I'm going to give each caller about a minute because I want to get to everybody.
[1:35:50.640 --> 1:35:55.720]  Archangel, Jean, Greg, Steve, Darren, Joe, Bill, others, Archangel and Pennsylvania, you're
[1:35:55.720 --> 1:35:56.720]  on the air.
[1:35:56.720 --> 1:35:57.720]  Welcome.
[1:35:57.720 --> 1:35:58.720]  Hey, Alex.
[1:35:58.720 --> 1:35:59.720]  How you doing?
[1:35:59.720 --> 1:36:00.720]  Good.
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:01.720]  Hey, just real quick.
[1:36:01.720 --> 1:36:02.720]  I wanted to bring up the speed on three things.
[1:36:02.720 --> 1:36:05.720]  Well, the first thing I agree, they're going to make a move against the student, Paul Spive
[1:36:05.720 --> 1:36:06.720]  or something.
[1:36:06.720 --> 1:36:07.720]  They're going to hit a student.
[1:36:07.720 --> 1:36:08.720]  That's my first quick point.
[1:36:08.720 --> 1:36:13.000]  My second point is I got my posters off, I got my posters all over my property and my
[1:36:13.000 --> 1:36:14.000]  flags.
[1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.720]  Most of the neighbors don't know what to think about it, but most of them agree.
[1:36:16.720 --> 1:36:21.240]  I've had two apparent, almost deaf people try and buy, try to stop and steal them.
[1:36:21.240 --> 1:36:23.120]  And I went out and stopped them.
[1:36:23.120 --> 1:36:28.200]  And then the most people are offended are the blacks and the young whites, the yuppies
[1:36:28.200 --> 1:36:30.840]  are driving by freaking out there.
[1:36:30.840 --> 1:36:35.160]  Oh yeah, for those that don't know, all over the country, we've had this contest in all
[1:36:35.160 --> 1:36:38.560]  of the world to put up Obama posters as socialist fascists.
[1:36:38.560 --> 1:36:39.560]  It's all command and control.
[1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:43.080]  You know, it's two different systems, but they confuse you with that new world order
[1:36:43.080 --> 1:36:49.280]  info wars.com front page, you know, the local section of the Toronto star, our event and
[1:36:49.280 --> 1:36:54.360]  videos are coming in of the yuppies coming over and grabbing them and ripping them and
[1:36:54.360 --> 1:36:59.720]  trying to attack people and saying, you have no free speech and there's a video of police
[1:36:59.720 --> 1:37:00.720]  coming up.
[1:37:00.720 --> 1:37:05.640]  We have this at a town hall outside saying, you're not allowed to have a sign.
[1:37:05.640 --> 1:37:09.640]  And the guy says, I thought this is America and the cops says he didn't America anymore
[1:37:09.640 --> 1:37:10.640]  and laughs.
[1:37:10.640 --> 1:37:11.640]  This isn't America.
[1:37:11.640 --> 1:37:12.640]  In fact, we can pull that up.
[1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:13.640]  I'm sorry.
[1:37:13.640 --> 1:37:14.640]  Go ahead.
[1:37:14.640 --> 1:37:15.640]  That's funny.
[1:37:15.640 --> 1:37:16.640]  Cops came by the other night on their routine patrol and they flashed their lights and siren
[1:37:16.640 --> 1:37:17.640]  away from it.
[1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:18.640]  Well, no, no, that's the issue.
[1:37:18.640 --> 1:37:19.640]  A lot of cops are good.
[1:37:19.640 --> 1:37:20.640]  They appreciate the First Amendment.
[1:37:20.640 --> 1:37:21.640]  And this is a racial thing.
[1:37:21.640 --> 1:37:34.200]  It's a black cop telling them you can't have a sign against Obama.
[1:37:34.200 --> 1:37:35.800]  In fact, here it is right here.
[1:37:35.800 --> 1:37:37.280]  In fact, cue this up.
[1:37:37.280 --> 1:37:38.280]  Back it up.
[1:37:38.280 --> 1:37:39.280]  The department says, here it is.
[1:37:39.280 --> 1:37:40.280]  Why can't it not be?
[1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:41.280]  It just can't be.
[1:37:41.280 --> 1:37:43.280]  Did you take a note to follow the Constitution?
[1:37:43.280 --> 1:37:44.280]  Yes, I did.
[1:37:44.280 --> 1:37:45.280]  You did?
[1:37:45.280 --> 1:37:46.280]  Yes.
[1:37:46.280 --> 1:37:47.280]  Where's in the Constitution?
[1:37:47.280 --> 1:37:48.280]  This is freedom.
[1:37:48.280 --> 1:37:49.280]  My job said it can't be.
[1:37:49.280 --> 1:37:50.280]  So I'm doing my job.
[1:37:50.280 --> 1:37:51.280]  Where does it say that in your job?
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:55.280]  Actually, school grounds have very different First Amendment rights than anywhere else.
[1:37:55.280 --> 1:37:56.280]  Anywhere.
[1:37:56.280 --> 1:37:58.280]  Churches, parks and everything like that.
[1:37:58.280 --> 1:38:02.120]  What's the difference between that and something here and something there and those
[1:38:02.120 --> 1:38:03.120]  over there?
[1:38:03.120 --> 1:38:04.120]  But you got this with a picture.
[1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:05.120]  That's the difference.
[1:38:05.120 --> 1:38:06.120]  This has got a picture on it.
[1:38:06.120 --> 1:38:07.120]  What does it mean?
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:08.120]  That don't have a picture on it.
[1:38:08.120 --> 1:38:09.120]  So what?
[1:38:09.120 --> 1:38:10.120]  Sir, leave the picture down.
[1:38:10.120 --> 1:38:11.120]  If you don't, if you put the picture back up, you will be charged with trespassing and
[1:38:11.120 --> 1:38:12.120]  you will have to go.
[1:38:12.120 --> 1:38:13.120]  Okay?
[1:38:13.120 --> 1:38:14.120]  Well, wait a second.
[1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:15.120]  I'm charged with trespassing?
[1:38:15.120 --> 1:38:16.120]  I said you will be.
[1:38:16.120 --> 1:38:17.120]  But that's not trespassing, haven't you?
[1:38:17.120 --> 1:38:18.120]  If I told you once to take it down and you put it back up, then I can charge you whatever
[1:38:18.120 --> 1:38:19.120]  I want to charge you with.
[1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:20.120]  Okay?
[1:38:20.120 --> 1:38:21.120]  So I'm telling you.
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:22.120]  So you make the law, too?
[1:38:22.120 --> 1:38:23.120]  Put the picture down, sir.
[1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:24.120]  Thank you.
[1:38:24.120 --> 1:38:25.120]  Thank you, sir.
[1:38:25.120 --> 1:38:34.120]  This is America.
[1:38:34.120 --> 1:38:35.120]  This used to be America.
[1:38:35.120 --> 1:38:36.120]  It ain't no more.
[1:38:36.120 --> 1:38:37.120]  Okay?
[1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:38.120]  I know it ain't.
[1:38:38.120 --> 1:38:39.120]  That's the point of the picture.
[1:38:39.120 --> 1:38:40.120]  The U.S.
[1:38:40.120 --> 1:38:41.120]  That's it.
[1:38:41.120 --> 1:38:42.120]  I can't watch it anymore.
[1:38:42.120 --> 1:38:46.800]  I mean, he's in uniform saying this ain't America no more.
[1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:47.800]  Sit down.
[1:38:47.800 --> 1:38:50.520]  Now, this is out in a high school parking lot.
[1:38:50.520 --> 1:38:53.480]  There's people for and against government health care.
[1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:58.800]  This guy's got one as Obama the Joker, as usual, one of our listeners.
[1:38:58.800 --> 1:39:02.880]  And he's told, hey, you're not allowed to have that.
[1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:05.880]  Now, again, it's white yuppies mainly that come over.
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:08.760]  That's the first time I've seen a black person.
[1:39:08.760 --> 1:39:15.600]  But the issue is, is that they're crazy and they're nuts.
[1:39:15.600 --> 1:39:18.640]  And that's why we got to put more of these signs up, letting them know we're not going
[1:39:18.640 --> 1:39:19.880]  to give into their intimidation.
[1:39:19.880 --> 1:39:23.600]  Mark Angel, finish up what you were saying.
[1:39:23.600 --> 1:39:27.600]  Like I said, I have them, they're all over my lawn, they're in every window of my house.
[1:39:27.600 --> 1:39:31.560]  It looks like the United Nations when you run go by, I have like 15 flags hanging about
[1:39:31.560 --> 1:39:32.560]  30 posters.
[1:39:32.560 --> 1:39:36.560]  So it looks great, but my neighbors are peaking.
[1:39:36.560 --> 1:39:42.080]  On the third thing, the most important thing on the G20 Pittsburgh gun confiscation ban
[1:39:42.080 --> 1:39:48.960]  that they're trying to do, myself and Kim Stolfer of FOAC, which is firearms owner against
[1:39:48.960 --> 1:39:49.960]  crime.
[1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:54.200]  Now again, the county sportsman's league and the NRA have all been in contacting with
[1:39:54.200 --> 1:39:55.200]  each other.
[1:39:55.200 --> 1:39:59.800]  And we're thinking about filing a lawsuit, a federal lawsuit against them if they follow
[1:39:59.800 --> 1:40:00.800]  through with this.
[1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:04.440]  They're going to have a meeting this Wednesday at 1.30 at Pittsburgh city council to see
[1:40:04.440 --> 1:40:05.960]  if they're going to prove this or not.
[1:40:05.960 --> 1:40:13.360]  In fact, in fact, I'm like somebody with 10 baseball pitching machines shooting balls
[1:40:13.360 --> 1:40:14.360]  at me.
[1:40:14.360 --> 1:40:15.360]  And that's why it's good.
[1:40:15.360 --> 1:40:16.360]  We take calls.
[1:40:16.360 --> 1:40:18.680]  They're going to ban that Pittsburgh Post Gazette Friday.
[1:40:18.680 --> 1:40:23.160]  They're going to ban assault weapons in the city, which is any semi auto or multiple shot
[1:40:23.160 --> 1:40:24.880]  handgun or rifle.
[1:40:24.880 --> 1:40:30.520]  And then that allows them quote in emergencies, whenever they say to violate the second amendment
[1:40:30.520 --> 1:40:35.220]  and they announced for G20 meetings, the last one they had in the U S and in other countries
[1:40:35.220 --> 1:40:37.160]  that you're under martial law.
[1:40:37.160 --> 1:40:41.960]  The headline in Canada is Chinese style martial law for Olympics.
[1:40:41.960 --> 1:40:47.040]  So they're training us any way, any way they can any time that your second amendment's
[1:40:47.040 --> 1:40:55.600]  bad when the real owners that by the way, this is in, let me find the article here.
[1:40:55.600 --> 1:40:58.680]  This is in a major scientific journal.
[1:40:58.680 --> 1:40:59.680]  Yeah.
[1:40:59.680 --> 1:41:08.520]  Inside science had a top analysis of 48 countries by top scientist and computer physicist of
[1:41:08.520 --> 1:41:14.960]  the world economy and found that only a few global banks actually own basically everything.
[1:41:14.960 --> 1:41:19.680]  So, so again, and they've created it all through fiat, it's made up money and they
[1:41:19.680 --> 1:41:20.680]  admit that.
[1:41:20.680 --> 1:41:25.880]  So, so the issue here is, is that these are the real owners in fact, I appreciate your
[1:41:25.880 --> 1:41:26.880]  call archangel.
[1:41:26.880 --> 1:41:27.880]  Just great points.
[1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:29.880]  Let's, let's get somebody on about that assault weapons man.
[1:41:29.880 --> 1:41:30.880]  That's what I mean.
[1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:31.880]  I can't.
[1:41:31.880 --> 1:41:32.880]  Here's another one.
[1:41:32.880 --> 1:41:36.840]  AP has been sued and they've lost in Dutch court.
[1:41:36.840 --> 1:41:41.320]  But under the Dutch system, the German royalty, the same family that runs England, the House
[1:41:41.320 --> 1:41:47.360]  of Orange, it's illegal to photograph them or to talk about them.
[1:41:47.360 --> 1:41:51.680]  See government makes itself God where it's all secret and when your government's your
[1:41:51.680 --> 1:41:56.960]  queen and then you have no rights, no privacy and the government gets more rights and privacy.
[1:41:56.960 --> 1:41:58.400]  It's the boss, you're the slave.
[1:41:58.400 --> 1:42:05.640]  They were in Argentina skiing in a lake at a popular resort and AP took a photo and they're
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:07.800]  talking about millions of dollars in fines.
[1:42:07.800 --> 1:42:13.360]  In fact, Google that for folks, Dutch royal family wins suit or bring it up and they're
[1:42:13.360 --> 1:42:19.800]  saying you can't photograph royalty worldwide, but you can photograph anybody else in public
[1:42:19.800 --> 1:42:25.420]  but not royalty because they're the bastards that own Dutch Royal Shell BP.
[1:42:25.420 --> 1:42:26.420]  They own the banks.
[1:42:26.420 --> 1:42:27.640]  I'm just sick of it.
[1:42:27.640 --> 1:42:32.360]  I photograph Queen Beatrix and I'll go on doing it at Bilderberg in 2006.
[1:42:32.360 --> 1:42:35.920]  It's in my film in game blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:40.120]  I photographed her and I'm going to go on photographing her meeting with world leaders
[1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:42.160]  to set up world government.
[1:42:42.160 --> 1:42:45.520]  I've got that witch crone on video and I'll do it, but you know what?
[1:42:45.520 --> 1:42:46.520]  They had me arrested.
[1:42:46.520 --> 1:42:49.200]  They told me I was under arrest when I got out the plane.
[1:42:49.200 --> 1:42:52.760]  They said you're here for the conference and they threw my button handcuffs and slammed
[1:42:52.760 --> 1:42:56.400]  me in the wall and they kept me for 15 hours.
[1:42:56.400 --> 1:43:01.160]  So I got a message out to the media that showed up to get my butt out of the airport security
[1:43:01.160 --> 1:43:02.800]  and customs.
[1:43:02.800 --> 1:43:10.040]  I've been put in a jail cell by this piece of trash who thinks I'm her slave.
[1:43:10.040 --> 1:43:11.560]  Listen to me, Queen Beatrix.
[1:43:11.560 --> 1:43:13.440]  You don't own me, you Genesis.
[1:43:13.440 --> 1:43:18.200]  You're a Nazi father that set up the world while I fun and was a top Nazi and wants
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:19.200]  to fund eugenics.
[1:43:19.200 --> 1:43:20.280]  I'm sick of you.
[1:43:20.280 --> 1:43:23.840]  We cover it in my film in game.
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:28.000]  Just at a fundamental level, I am not this piece of trash as slave.
[1:43:28.000 --> 1:43:29.880]  You can't photograph the God.
[1:43:29.880 --> 1:43:34.760]  Dutch Royals win privacy case and the media, it's not even allowed to talk about it.
[1:43:34.760 --> 1:43:38.600]  I didn't like to talk about it in the Netherlands.
[1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:42.920]  I mean, what type of freedom is that where these people are gods at the Bilderberg group
[1:43:42.920 --> 1:43:43.920]  meeting?
[1:43:43.920 --> 1:43:48.080]  They tell the maids and people not to even look at the Bilderberg members and they just
[1:43:48.080 --> 1:43:50.560]  walk around treating the help like total crap.
[1:43:50.560 --> 1:43:54.840]  The help never wants to spy on them for us before the event, but after they just give
[1:43:54.840 --> 1:43:57.520]  us everything going, these are inhuman trash.
[1:43:57.520 --> 1:43:58.520]  You're called straight ahead.
[1:43:58.520 --> 1:44:00.800]  Stay with us.
[1:44:00.800 --> 1:44:05.440]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:44:05.440 --> 1:44:06.440]  you to eat.
[1:44:06.440 --> 1:44:09.960]  Will you continue to be their profit center, buying their processed food that makes you
[1:44:09.960 --> 1:44:12.920]  sick, go to the doctor and buy their drugs?
[1:44:12.920 --> 1:44:14.600]  You don't have to cooperate.
[1:44:14.600 --> 1:44:15.880]  There is a solution.
[1:44:15.880 --> 1:44:19.480]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[1:44:19.480 --> 1:44:24.280]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[1:44:24.280 --> 1:44:29.400]  Buy their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the
[1:44:29.400 --> 1:44:31.680]  energy you need and will keep you well.
[1:44:31.680 --> 1:44:36.960]  It even won the award for best super food of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health
[1:44:36.960 --> 1:44:37.960]  manager.
[1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:42.600]  I love their Nutric Cafe, great organic coffee, infused with herbal extracts to boost your
[1:44:42.600 --> 1:44:43.800]  immune system.

[1:45:01.200 --> 1:45:05.600]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[1:45:05.600 --> 1:45:06.600]  this summer.
[1:45:06.600 --> 1:45:10.520]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:15.080]  Number two, our new energies are, wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:45:15.080 --> 1:45:16.320]  allows you to have.
[1:45:16.320 --> 1:45:21.080]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[1:45:21.080 --> 1:45:25.560]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[1:45:25.560 --> 1:45:27.960]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[1:45:27.960 --> 1:45:31.560]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[1:45:31.560 --> 1:45:35.200]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[1:45:35.200 --> 1:45:39.760]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[1:45:39.760 --> 1:45:43.920]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[1:45:43.920 --> 1:45:45.600]  a long time sponsor of ours.
[1:45:45.600 --> 1:45:50.360]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:04.280]  This is Alex Jones, have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[1:46:04.280 --> 1:46:05.280]  Well you should.
[1:46:05.280 --> 1:46:10.520]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you, that's right.

[1:46:25.360 --> 1:46:27.720]  pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[1:46:27.720 --> 1:46:31.840]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels
[1:46:31.840 --> 1:46:34.920]  that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[1:46:34.920 --> 1:46:39.320]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor
[1:46:39.320 --> 1:46:40.400]  attitudes.

[1:47:01.520 --> 1:47:04.560]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[1:47:04.560 --> 1:47:08.920]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[1:47:08.920 --> 1:47:09.920]  do you want?
[1:47:09.920 --> 1:47:11.920]  My answer would be all I can get.
[1:47:11.920 --> 1:47:16.960]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[1:47:16.960 --> 1:47:18.200]  How much do you want?
[1:47:18.200 --> 1:47:19.280]  When do you want it?
[1:47:19.280 --> 1:47:21.220]  Now or after the battle starts.
[1:47:21.220 --> 1:47:22.360]  When will you need it?
[1:47:22.360 --> 1:47:24.480]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[1:47:24.480 --> 1:47:25.800]  Will there be any food?
[1:47:25.800 --> 1:47:27.280]  Will it make your children sick?
[1:47:27.280 --> 1:47:31.400]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[1:47:31.400 --> 1:47:32.560]  and be immunized?
[1:47:32.560 --> 1:47:36.360]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:39.800]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[1:47:39.800 --> 1:47:41.160]  How much will you need?
[1:47:41.160 --> 1:47:42.160]  We don't know.
[1:47:42.160 --> 1:47:43.160]  How much do you want?
[1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:44.160]  All you can get.
[1:47:44.160 --> 1:47:45.160]  I'm Alex Jones.
[1:47:45.160 --> 1:47:48.240]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[1:47:48.240 --> 1:47:55.680]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[1:47:55.680 --> 1:48:13.520]  Again, that number, 1-800-409-5633.
[1:48:13.520 --> 1:48:20.200]  If you search in the term, in-game trailer, you can see when I videotaped from 200 yards
[1:48:20.200 --> 1:48:25.200]  away, Queen Beatrix had a super zoom on the camera.
[1:48:25.200 --> 1:48:31.720]  And they tried to have police come out and tell the Canadian newspapers they couldn't
[1:48:31.720 --> 1:48:32.720]  be there taking photos.
[1:48:32.720 --> 1:48:34.720]  And the papers said, go ahead and arrest us.
[1:48:34.720 --> 1:48:37.840]  I mean, we got to say no to these bastards.
[1:48:37.840 --> 1:48:40.680]  But they got some kangaroo court they own and run in the Netherlands.
[1:48:40.680 --> 1:48:42.160]  It's only associated press.
[1:48:42.160 --> 1:48:43.720]  They can't take photos of them.
[1:48:43.720 --> 1:48:48.000]  I mean, you can't take photos of somebody in their backyard if it's got a fence.
[1:48:48.000 --> 1:48:49.960]  There is the perception of privacy.
[1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:53.840]  But if there's not the perception of privacy, you don't have it.
[1:48:53.840 --> 1:48:55.880]  Look, it just makes me mad.
[1:48:55.880 --> 1:48:57.880]  Gene and Georgia, go ahead then others.
[1:48:57.880 --> 1:48:58.880]  Go ahead, Gene.
[1:48:58.880 --> 1:48:59.880]  Yes, sir.
[1:48:59.880 --> 1:49:00.880]  Can you hear me?
[1:49:00.880 --> 1:49:01.880]  Yes, we've got to move quick.
[1:49:01.880 --> 1:49:02.880]  Go ahead.
[1:49:02.880 --> 1:49:03.880]  Okay.
[1:49:03.880 --> 1:49:12.880]  At notaxesnow.org, we've got a plan to take the money away from the international bankers.
[1:49:12.880 --> 1:49:18.000]  Eric Williams has a 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution to do just that.
[1:49:18.000 --> 1:49:23.320]  Basically what that is is that instead of taxes being used to pay interest to the international
[1:49:23.320 --> 1:49:27.840]  bankers, interest should be used to pay all the taxes.
[1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:31.920]  And that's basically what the American Revolution was really all about with the colonial script
[1:49:31.920 --> 1:49:34.320]  and the four American Commonwealths that we have.
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:35.320]  Yes, it was.
[1:49:35.320 --> 1:49:36.320]  I appreciate your call.
[1:49:36.320 --> 1:49:40.400]  For thousands of years, they've used the banking Ponzi scheme of Frational Reserve to
[1:49:40.400 --> 1:49:41.560]  take over.
[1:49:41.560 --> 1:49:44.400]  We didn't have the income tax till 1913.
[1:49:44.400 --> 1:49:48.840]  All the money you pay in income tax goes to interest of the private banks who give us
[1:49:48.840 --> 1:49:51.120]  the pleasure of printing our own money.
[1:49:51.120 --> 1:50:00.000]  An example of this is trillions are raised, trillions every couple years just on truck
[1:50:00.000 --> 1:50:04.240]  driving taxes and freight taxes and tariffs.
[1:50:04.240 --> 1:50:05.720]  That's what really runs the government.
[1:50:05.720 --> 1:50:08.880]  The income tax was passed with the Federal Reserve Act.
[1:50:08.880 --> 1:50:10.200]  That's how they rape us.
[1:50:10.200 --> 1:50:14.240]  Now they're setting up the Bank of the World with a carbon tax to rape you even further.
[1:50:14.240 --> 1:50:16.440]  And I'm sure people are going to love it.
[1:50:16.440 --> 1:50:18.440]  Let's talk to Stephen Houston.
[1:50:18.440 --> 1:50:20.000]  Stephen Houston, you're on the air.
[1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:21.880]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex.
[1:50:21.880 --> 1:50:27.720]  Hey, before I get to why I call, which is this thing about back in Limbaugh versus you,
[1:50:27.720 --> 1:50:28.720]  I just wanted to say this.
[1:50:28.720 --> 1:50:33.280]  A couple weeks ago on your weekday show, you were talking about how this just grieves you
[1:50:33.280 --> 1:50:38.200]  and weighs you down, all this knowledge that you have, and you were asking for a specific
[1:50:38.200 --> 1:50:39.200]  scripture.
[1:50:39.200 --> 1:50:43.960]  It's in Ecclesiastes 118, it says, for in much wisdom is much grief.
[1:50:43.960 --> 1:50:49.120]  And he had an increase of knowledge, increase of style, so the more you learn about this
[1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:52.920]  stuff, man, I can totally understand why it weighs your heart down so much.
[1:50:52.920 --> 1:50:57.200]  And people that aren't into this or don't understand this, they have no understanding
[1:50:57.200 --> 1:50:58.200]  of why you're like this.
[1:50:58.200 --> 1:51:00.760]  And this leads me to what I wanted to say.
[1:51:00.760 --> 1:51:05.080]  Why are back in Limbaugh, they seem to be saying, at least to a point, the same stuff
[1:51:05.080 --> 1:51:06.080]  you are?
[1:51:06.080 --> 1:51:07.080]  Well, here's the difference.
[1:51:07.080 --> 1:51:12.240]  These guys, the Bible says, for the love of money is the root of all evil.
[1:51:12.240 --> 1:51:17.160]  You've quoted many times that quote from Mark Twain about what a true patriot is.
[1:51:17.160 --> 1:51:21.480]  And the thing is, these guys, as far as I'm concerned, they're not true patriots.
[1:51:21.480 --> 1:51:28.080]  I believe, like you said, that Beck's an operative, Limbaugh's just the poster boy for the neocons.
[1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:34.120]  But these guys have too much to lose monetarily and positionally, whereas you, you're doing
[1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:39.600]  this because you're just an American and a patriot that's standing for what you believe
[1:51:39.600 --> 1:51:40.600]  and know is right.
[1:51:40.600 --> 1:51:45.360]  And I'll tell you something, Alex, I had a guy about a month ago, you know, I was talking
[1:51:45.360 --> 1:51:48.760]  about this stuff and he says, well, you know, I'm just one guy.
[1:51:48.760 --> 1:51:49.880]  What can one guy do?
[1:51:49.880 --> 1:51:56.440]  But I thought, well, I know of one guy in Austin, Texas, and he's done a whole bunch.
[1:51:56.440 --> 1:52:00.240]  And I know you're not the only one, but I'll tell you something from what I've seen.
[1:52:00.240 --> 1:52:05.000]  And I've been on board with this for, you know, 10 years or so now, for as far as folding
[1:52:05.000 --> 1:52:07.280]  the New World Order and what they're about.
[1:52:07.280 --> 1:52:09.680]  I don't know of anybody.
[1:52:09.680 --> 1:52:13.760]  There's others out there, but you, as far as I'm concerned, are the most passionate
[1:52:13.760 --> 1:52:20.640]  about this and fighting this cause of liberty against the globalist and what Steve, I appreciate
[1:52:20.640 --> 1:52:24.120]  the kind words I'm going to move on to other folks because phone system was down the first
[1:52:24.120 --> 1:52:25.120]  hour and a half.
[1:52:25.120 --> 1:52:30.160]  And I want to get to everybody, but why do I have the big foundations attacking me?
[1:52:30.160 --> 1:52:32.520]  Why do I have the mainstream media attacking me?
[1:52:32.520 --> 1:52:35.120]  Why do I have the alternative media attacking me?
[1:52:35.120 --> 1:52:40.400]  A lot of them are government paid for it, but they're getting ready to shut down the
[1:52:40.400 --> 1:52:46.200]  even the mainline opposition of talk radio and they've introduced the bills to do it.
[1:52:46.200 --> 1:52:49.840]  So in that they can do it with those guys, they can do it with everybody.
[1:52:49.840 --> 1:52:50.840]  This is serious.
[1:52:50.840 --> 1:52:52.960]  They're talking about a new code.
[1:52:52.960 --> 1:52:55.360]  The feds are going to run over media.
[1:52:55.360 --> 1:52:58.200]  We've got to say no.
[1:52:58.200 --> 1:52:59.680]  Let's talk to Darren in Ireland.
[1:52:59.680 --> 1:53:00.680]  Darren, I would have gone to you earlier.
[1:53:00.680 --> 1:53:04.080]  I saw you were calling in from great old Ireland.
[1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:05.080]  Welcome, Darren.
[1:53:05.080 --> 1:53:06.080]  Hello, Alex Jones.
[1:53:06.080 --> 1:53:11.800]  I'm a huge fan and thanks for taking my call, I know it's late here in Ireland, but I really
[1:53:11.800 --> 1:53:15.440]  have to get through with some urgent news on the Lisbon Treaty.
[1:53:15.440 --> 1:53:20.160]  It's in October and the propaganda is going absolutely crazy.
[1:53:20.160 --> 1:53:22.720]  For those that don't know, then I'll have you comment on it.
[1:53:22.720 --> 1:53:24.640]  You guys have said no repeatedly.
[1:53:24.640 --> 1:53:27.240]  So has England to the Lisbon Treaty.
[1:53:27.240 --> 1:53:29.840]  They let a few countries, France and one other vote on it.
[1:53:29.840 --> 1:53:32.280]  They said no and they say, we don't care.
[1:53:32.280 --> 1:53:37.440]  We're going to keep trying to pass it till you pass it or we'll just have the bureaucracy
[1:53:37.440 --> 1:53:40.440]  fold you into Europe whether you like it or not.
[1:53:40.440 --> 1:53:41.440]  Yeah, exactly.
[1:53:41.440 --> 1:53:46.880]  We've been fighting to fight for the past 6 to 700 years and our constitution is only
[1:53:46.880 --> 1:53:47.880]  72 years old.
[1:53:47.880 --> 1:53:48.880]  We'll take here.
[1:53:48.880 --> 1:53:53.640]  They won't even tell us we're officially under a North American Union since March 24th,
[1:53:53.640 --> 1:53:54.640]  2005.
[1:53:54.640 --> 1:53:59.440]  The treaty is now public and the average yuppie just sucks their thumb all day with pleasure.
[1:53:59.440 --> 1:54:04.680]  I know Alex, it's crazy and I would like to come on maybe in the future and discuss the
[1:54:04.680 --> 1:54:05.680]  Lisbon Treaty before...
[1:54:05.680 --> 1:54:08.120]  Is this one of the guys from VR Change Ireland?
[1:54:08.120 --> 1:54:14.920]  Yes, I am and I want to discuss the relationship between Ireland and the United States of the
[1:54:14.920 --> 1:54:18.120]  Revolution that spread to Ireland and which...
[1:54:18.120 --> 1:54:19.120]  This is Darren.
[1:54:19.120 --> 1:54:20.120]  I forget your last name.
[1:54:20.120 --> 1:54:21.120]  You're one of the founders of VR Change.
[1:54:21.120 --> 1:54:22.120]  You're a filmmaker too.
[1:54:22.120 --> 1:54:23.120]  What's your last name?
[1:54:23.120 --> 1:54:24.120]  McNeely.
[1:54:24.120 --> 1:54:25.120]  It's Scott.
[1:54:25.120 --> 1:54:26.120]  Yeah.
[1:54:26.120 --> 1:54:31.080]  Okay, so you're... Well then, who are the VR Change from Ireland guys I've had on?
[1:54:31.080 --> 1:54:34.480]  One of them's named Darren as well, but you're Scott is living in Ireland.
[1:54:34.480 --> 1:54:37.280]  Well, no, I'm actually... Just a second name, Scott.
[1:54:37.280 --> 1:54:39.280]  I'm fully Irish anyway.
[1:54:39.280 --> 1:54:40.280]  Okay, whatever.
[1:54:40.280 --> 1:54:42.280]  Haven't I had you on before?
[1:54:42.280 --> 1:54:46.720]  No, I was on the Jess and Burma show twice, maybe, if you could, maybe a couple of years.
[1:54:46.720 --> 1:54:49.600]  Okay, look, look, I'm going to put you on hold, send us your info, okay?
[1:54:49.600 --> 1:54:52.440]  Speaking of Burma, he's coming up for 3 hours at infowars.com.
[1:54:52.440 --> 1:54:57.800]  Yes, we need to get all the VR Change guys, Ireland, and UK, and Scotland on to talk about
[1:54:57.800 --> 1:54:59.300]  fighting the globalist.
[1:54:59.300 --> 1:55:00.640]  We're defending our sovereignty.
[1:55:00.640 --> 1:55:03.600]  You go, well, world government's the next step.
[1:55:03.600 --> 1:55:08.680]  Even if you're for world government, the world government being set up is a tyrannical authoritarian
[1:55:08.680 --> 1:55:10.880]  system.
[1:55:10.880 --> 1:55:12.280]  Let's talk to Joe in Illinois.
[1:55:12.280 --> 1:55:13.720]  Joe, you're on the air.
[1:55:13.720 --> 1:55:14.720]  Go ahead.
[1:55:14.720 --> 1:55:15.720]  Hello, Alex.
[1:55:15.720 --> 1:55:17.520]  Pleasure to talk to you.
[1:55:17.520 --> 1:55:21.360]  I just wanted to connect a few dots for you on the Federal Reserve.
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:26.520]  You've been attacked by the numbers, 9-11, and with the Dow dropping down and bottoming
[1:55:26.520 --> 1:55:33.040]  out at 6,660, you know yourself that the Satanists are definitely pulling some strings there,
[1:55:33.040 --> 1:55:34.040]  correct?
[1:55:34.040 --> 1:55:38.480]  3-11 in Madrid, 7-7 in England, they're obsessed with numerology.
[1:55:38.480 --> 1:55:48.320]  All right, if you take 19-13, December 23rd, and run it on, say, a 99-year lease, which
[1:55:48.320 --> 1:55:53.760]  is the favorite government time block for any lease or ownership, you come up right
[1:55:53.760 --> 1:55:54.760]  at the Mayans' Soomsday.
[1:55:54.760 --> 1:55:57.760]  So I just thought you'd appreciate that.
[1:55:57.760 --> 1:56:01.280]  Wait a minute, 99 years goes to 2012?
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:02.280]  Correct.
[1:56:02.280 --> 1:56:03.800]  I guess that's true.
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:04.800]  What is it?
[1:56:04.800 --> 1:56:09.960]  December 23rd, 24th, they pass it at midnight, 19-13, Federal Reserve Act handing us over
[1:56:09.960 --> 1:56:11.440]  to private offshore banks.
[1:56:11.440 --> 1:56:14.800]  The 99 years would end in 2012.
[1:56:14.800 --> 1:56:15.800]  Right.
[1:56:15.800 --> 1:56:19.680]  So we might be looking at a bank holiday then, we might be looking at the Amaro.
[1:56:19.680 --> 1:56:24.120]  It's hard to tell how these guys are going to play it, but you can bet they're going
[1:56:24.120 --> 1:56:25.120]  to do something.
[1:56:25.120 --> 1:56:28.200]  All right, I appreciate your call.
[1:56:28.200 --> 1:56:29.280]  Thank you so much.
[1:56:29.280 --> 1:56:34.640]  By the way, I keep getting calls and emails from listeners asking, thinking that we're
[1:56:34.640 --> 1:56:39.720]  timing what's behind us on this TV screen at presentplanet.tv for what we're talking
[1:56:39.720 --> 1:56:40.720]  about.
[1:56:40.720 --> 1:56:46.080]  So these are all the headlines of the last year and a half at infowars.com.
[1:56:46.080 --> 1:56:49.200]  They just imported that, and I think it's kind of interesting.
[1:56:49.200 --> 1:56:55.280]  We're going to mix some other stuff into that as well, but that's a slideshow of past stories.
[1:56:55.280 --> 1:56:58.760]  Though sometimes I'll be talking about flu, and that's what pops up behind me, but it's
[1:56:58.760 --> 1:57:02.720]  not a, you're like, why did it, why did that pop up when he said that?
[1:57:02.720 --> 1:57:05.520]  Let's see what comes up next.
[1:57:05.520 --> 1:57:08.840]  Missouri Democrat, poor tour responsible to exercise Second Amendment.
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:12.000]  This type of crazy articles, that was about a month ago.
[1:57:12.000 --> 1:57:13.240]  Here's another headline.
[1:57:13.240 --> 1:57:17.480]  No room for info warriors in YouTube's hula's eyes universe.
[1:57:17.480 --> 1:57:20.680]  And that's another blast from the past.
[1:57:20.680 --> 1:57:22.240]  Let's take another call quickly.
[1:57:22.240 --> 1:57:23.240]  Bill in Texas.
[1:57:23.240 --> 1:57:24.240]  Go ahead.
[1:57:24.240 --> 1:57:25.240]  Alex.
[1:57:25.240 --> 1:57:26.240]  I just want to know one thing.
[1:57:26.240 --> 1:57:31.120]  I have school aged children and I want to know how I can keep them from getting a swine
[1:57:31.120 --> 1:57:33.200]  flu shot without going to jail.
[1:57:33.200 --> 1:57:36.560]  I mean, tell them back in 76, the trials killed a bunch of people.
[1:57:36.560 --> 1:57:39.640]  Other flu trials in Europe just killed a bunch of people.
[1:57:39.640 --> 1:57:43.520]  That's in mainstream news, though they sweep it under the rug and deny it.
[1:57:43.520 --> 1:57:44.520]  And it's your right.
[1:57:44.520 --> 1:57:49.040]  And if the flu starts breaking out really bad and is some bad flu, keep them home.
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:52.800]  It's better they miss a month of school than be six feet under.
[1:57:52.800 --> 1:57:56.000]  And I know this, my, my children, my children are homeschooled.
[1:57:56.000 --> 1:57:57.000]  Go ahead.
[1:57:57.000 --> 1:58:00.480]  But how do I keep them going to jail?
[1:58:00.480 --> 1:58:03.080]  Well they can say under level six.
[1:58:03.080 --> 1:58:05.480]  Now they're saying, oh, we go to level seven now.
[1:58:05.480 --> 1:58:07.640]  Six point two is what we're at.
[1:58:07.640 --> 1:58:09.840]  So they keep trying to raise the fear monitoring.
[1:58:09.840 --> 1:58:13.280]  It's like spinal tap where he goes, why not just have all the dials go to 10?
[1:58:13.280 --> 1:58:15.440]  He goes, but it's 11.
[1:58:15.440 --> 1:58:20.720]  So they've now had the dials go to 11, you know, 6.2.
[1:58:20.720 --> 1:58:22.560]  They're not going to be able to enforce this on everybody.
[1:58:22.560 --> 1:58:25.160]  They just want to set the precedent and fear monger.
[1:58:25.160 --> 1:58:26.560]  People are already standing up to them.
[1:58:26.560 --> 1:58:32.200]  Plus you have a religious exemption, conscientious exemption in every state in every major country.
[1:58:32.200 --> 1:58:33.200]  God bless you sir.
[1:58:33.200 --> 1:58:34.200]  We're out of time.
[1:58:34.200 --> 1:58:37.880]  That's what your flu news actually meant to get to.
[1:58:37.880 --> 1:58:42.000]  But regardless, I'll be back tomorrow 11 a.m. central, 12 noon and back next Sunday, four
[1:58:42.000 --> 1:58:43.000]  to 6 p.m.
[1:58:43.000 --> 1:58:48.840]  Great job to all the affiliates, all the stations to Paul Hartman in their running things.
[1:58:48.840 --> 1:58:50.880]  God bless you.
[1:58:50.880 --> 1:58:55.560]  The illusion created by the power elite is a lie that covers even the food they want
[1:58:55.560 --> 1:58:56.560]  you to eat.
[1:58:56.560 --> 1:59:00.080]  Will you continue to be their profit center buying their processed food that makes you
[1:59:00.080 --> 1:59:01.080]  sick?
[1:59:01.080 --> 1:59:03.040]  Go to the doctor and buy their drugs.
[1:59:03.040 --> 1:59:04.680]  You don't have to cooperate.
[1:59:04.680 --> 1:59:06.000]  There is a solution.
[1:59:06.000 --> 1:59:09.560]  Inner health botanicals, a company that my wife and I just love, have been providing
[1:59:09.560 --> 1:59:14.400]  products for the last five years that give you the perfect solution to this madness.
[1:59:14.400 --> 1:59:19.520]  Try their inner food with 20 organic ingredients full of dense nutrition that gives you the
[1:59:19.520 --> 1:59:21.780]  energy you need and will keep you well.
[1:59:21.780 --> 1:59:27.000]  It even won the award for best super food of 2009 from our friend Mike Adams, the health
[1:59:27.000 --> 1:59:34.480]  manager.
