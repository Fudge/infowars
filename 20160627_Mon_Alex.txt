[00:00.000 --> 00:07.360]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[00:07.360 --> 00:18.520]  a war on for your mind.
[00:18.520 --> 00:21.440]  Let me just start the broadcast like this.
[00:21.440 --> 00:28.720]  Democratic Party Platform officially calls for prosecuting man-made global warming skeptics.
[00:28.720 --> 00:33.360]  So we point out that all these UN heads and people are making massive amounts of money
[00:33.360 --> 00:36.680]  off carbon taxes and it's all a giant scam.
[00:36.680 --> 00:39.200]  You point out the sun is the main driver of climate.
[00:39.200 --> 00:41.000]  They want you arrested.
[00:41.000 --> 00:44.280]  We know the Democrats have been pushing that here, they've been pushing it in Europe, but
[00:44.280 --> 00:48.280]  it doesn't matter that we found their emails that got hacked six years ago showing major
[00:48.280 --> 00:52.440]  universities coordinating with the UN to, quote, hide the decline.
[00:52.440 --> 00:57.680]  None of that really matters because they just want to arrest those of us that call them
[00:57.680 --> 01:00.520]  out for being the criminals they are.
[01:00.520 --> 01:04.600]  And the Communist Chinese have come out and announced incredible internet censorship including
[01:04.600 --> 01:09.520]  of Western companies that don't submit to their guidelines and Reuters and others come
[01:09.520 --> 01:14.000]  out and kind of write about it like it's an OK thing because they don't want to be censored
[01:14.000 --> 01:15.000]  in China.
[01:15.000 --> 01:19.320]  In the past, as bad as our media has been, they wouldn't join with the Communist Chinese
[01:19.320 --> 01:23.440]  government that has mobile execution vans in every city killing political dissidents
[01:23.440 --> 01:28.880]  and executing you if they find out you're a closet Buddhist who the Buddhist attacked
[01:28.880 --> 01:30.320]  ever.
[01:30.320 --> 01:34.520]  So this is what we're dealing with here is just incredible.
[01:34.520 --> 01:40.720]  The Talitarianism galloping and by the way, we didn't predict accurately what the EU was
[01:40.720 --> 01:46.360]  going to do if there was a pro British exit from the Euro.
[01:46.360 --> 01:47.760]  We knew what they would do.
[01:47.760 --> 01:55.480]  They would try to trigger clauses that they have claiming that if you don't have 75 percent
[01:55.480 --> 01:58.680]  for an exit, you're not allowed to leave.
[01:58.680 --> 02:05.440]  The UK never got to vote to enter out of 25 that have entered the EU.
[02:05.440 --> 02:08.920]  Only two of them ever had a vote.
[02:08.920 --> 02:11.720]  Other countries have voted to get out and when they vote to get out, they're not allowed
[02:11.720 --> 02:12.720]  to get out.
[02:12.720 --> 02:16.120]  Now, that's called being a prisoner.
[02:16.120 --> 02:21.280]  England has its own military and this was incredible about a zero head story up on infowars.com.
[02:21.280 --> 02:24.000]  We're going to be covering it in detail.
[02:24.000 --> 02:27.760]  They themselves say their answer is a new super state.
[02:27.760 --> 02:32.200]  That's what George Soros called for yesterday and they're telling members that haven't
[02:32.200 --> 02:33.520]  left yet.
[02:33.520 --> 02:38.520]  We're abolishing your militaries and next is your police.
[02:38.520 --> 02:45.560]  The final phase of occupation EU response to British exit.
[02:45.560 --> 02:51.880]  The British exit to totalitarian super state, Hurt Nemo's written a story about it at infowars.com.
[02:51.880 --> 02:56.560]  Measure will strip sovereignty of member states and the new Americans reporting on it, zero
[02:56.560 --> 03:02.600]  hedges reporting on it, it is simply mind blowing and this is what's being said.
[03:02.600 --> 03:04.600]  I mean, we knew they'd do it.
[03:04.600 --> 03:09.360]  We knew they'd come out and say, oh, sorry, it wasn't 75 percent or another member state
[03:09.360 --> 03:17.000]  of your United Kingdom, Scotland didn't vote to do it so they can block you or we're going
[03:17.000 --> 03:21.600]  to hold your bank account money or we're going to blockade your trade.
[03:21.600 --> 03:27.560]  Well, Europe is teetering just as bad as the UK is under globalist control so England
[03:27.560 --> 03:32.720]  should play guts ball with these EU bureaucrats and say, listen, you unelected slimes.
[03:32.720 --> 03:36.200]  The only difference between you and Hitler is you're not driving pans or tanks and don't
[03:36.200 --> 03:47.560]  have stucas dive bombing, Krakow in London and Leningrad.
[03:47.560 --> 03:53.880]  Civil uprising escalates as eight EU nations threaten referendum as the eighth nation joins
[03:53.880 --> 04:00.160]  it and their response is, hey, we're coming with our military.
[04:00.160 --> 04:06.800]  The EU overthrew, two and a half years ago, Ukraine, an elected government, installed
[04:06.800 --> 04:12.120]  right wing fascists that actually halt Hitler and then they invaded the East, so hardcore
[04:12.120 --> 04:17.280]  that's always been Russian held that the Russians begged and seceded and then they
[04:17.280 --> 04:18.440]  call that Russian aggression.
[04:18.440 --> 04:22.960]  Listen, I'm an American, I don't have a dog in this fight other than the fact that I don't
[04:22.960 --> 04:28.160]  want to be part of a country that's assigned to NATO and the UN and the EU that are running
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.600]  around starting World War III.
[04:32.600 --> 04:36.440]  And the Russians have come out, Putin came out in a statement and said this is similar
[04:36.440 --> 04:43.640]  to the collapse of the Soviet Union and it is, an unelected criminal, totalitarian, socialist,
[04:43.640 --> 04:50.240]  communist, militaristic, power grabbing, out of control organization that fits the EU to
[04:50.240 --> 04:56.160]  a T, it fits the old Soviet Union to a T, the EU needs to be destroyed.
[04:56.160 --> 05:04.760]  Both TLP nominee Donald Trump and leftist investor George Soros have predicted the complete
[05:04.760 --> 05:08.920]  downfall of the European Union, despite Trump being a nationalist and Soros a globalist.
[05:08.920 --> 05:12.480]  The two billionaires both independently declared that they believe a domino effect has been
[05:12.480 --> 05:16.600]  started by Britain's decision to leave the EU and the process will be difficult for anyone
[05:16.600 --> 05:18.880]  to stop, as reported by Steve Watson.
[05:18.880 --> 05:22.840]  Soros said, quote, now the catastrophic scenario that many feared has materialized, making
[05:22.840 --> 05:25.640]  the disintegration of the EU practically irreversible.
[05:25.640 --> 05:29.080]  Trump also predicted a complete breakup of the EU and also warned that the continent
[05:29.080 --> 05:33.040]  would be completely unrecognizable within 10 years if strict immigration controls are
[05:33.040 --> 05:34.200]  not enacted.
[05:34.200 --> 05:38.120]  Trump told reporters, quote, the people have spoken, I think the EU is going to break up,
[05:38.120 --> 05:41.440]  I think the EU might break up before anyone thinks in terms of Scotland.
[05:41.440 --> 05:45.200]  Trump is referring to the resistance Scottish politicians are still giving Brexit.
[05:45.200 --> 05:49.000]  He continued stating that, I really think that without the immigration issue, the EU
[05:49.000 --> 05:50.960]  wouldn't have had a chance of breaking up.
[05:50.960 --> 05:54.640]  The people are fed up, whether it's here or in other countries, you watch, other countries
[05:54.640 --> 05:55.640]  will follow.
[05:55.640 --> 05:56.640]  For more news, visit infoworse.com.
[05:56.640 --> 06:26.440]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[06:57.560 --> 06:58.560]  3139.
[06:58.560 --> 07:04.360]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an
[07:04.360 --> 07:08.400]  outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[07:08.400 --> 07:09.400]  Here's why.
[07:09.400 --> 07:13.160]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse.
[07:13.160 --> 07:17.680]  So please listen, solar generators really do provide life saving electrical power.
[07:17.680 --> 07:22.600]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases and
[07:22.600 --> 07:24.440]  produce electricity from the sun.
[07:24.440 --> 07:29.280]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[07:29.280 --> 07:31.680]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[07:31.680 --> 07:34.360]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[07:34.360 --> 07:38.960]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're
[07:38.960 --> 07:43.480]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low
[07:43.480 --> 07:45.560]  price for infill wars listeners.
[07:45.560 --> 07:47.280]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[07:47.280 --> 07:50.720]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[07:50.720 --> 07:54.600]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[07:54.600 --> 08:20.920]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[08:20.920 --> 08:26.520]  Stories linked up at dredgerreports.com, it's linked up on infowars.com as well.
[08:26.520 --> 08:33.840]  The Daily Caller, Democratic Party platform calls for prosecuting global warming skeptics
[08:33.840 --> 08:38.760]  and they have the subsection there and even a video of them talking about how wonderful
[08:38.760 --> 08:41.800]  it's going to be.
[08:41.800 --> 08:50.600]  That is the criminal persecution of the American people in line with what the UN's been saying
[08:50.600 --> 08:51.720]  they want.
[08:51.720 --> 08:56.240]  If you come out and expose this criminal world government takeover that is to be funded with
[08:56.240 --> 09:02.240]  at least $100 trillion every decade off of carbon taxes with Hillary Clinton, Al Gore,
[09:02.240 --> 09:12.360]  Bill Clinton, most of the British leadership, Obama, the Rothschilds, the other classic
[09:12.360 --> 09:22.600]  elitist names, the Sorosys, all standing to make billions of peace per year off of all
[09:22.600 --> 09:23.600]  of your carbon activity.
[09:23.600 --> 09:27.240]  Because they haven't been able to implement this, all over the United States, I see it
[09:27.240 --> 09:31.160]  in Austin, I see it in San Francisco particularly, so-called liberal areas, that means brainwashed
[09:31.160 --> 09:36.080]  cult member, anti-liberal areas, zombie areas, fascist areas, slave areas where people love
[09:36.080 --> 09:37.080]  being slaves.
[09:37.080 --> 09:40.640]  They have carbon indulgences on their car like you're paying it to the Vatican to stay
[09:40.640 --> 09:47.520]  out of hell or something, you know, Cicera 800 years ago and it says I pay a carbon tax
[09:47.520 --> 09:52.120]  to this private company and then they offset what I'm doing planting trees or whatever.
[09:52.120 --> 09:56.320]  Of course it turns out almost all of that's a giant scam as well but this is just where
[09:56.320 --> 10:02.760]  you pay for carbon taxes directly to the London and Chicago and Frankfurt mercantiles
[10:02.760 --> 10:09.560]  and the Paris mercantiles for a giant commodities screw job, a global commodities tax run and
[10:09.560 --> 10:16.120]  operated by private interest tax exempt with diplomatic immunity.
[10:16.120 --> 10:24.760]  Of course they want to arrest you if you call these criminals, simply mind blowing, I mean
[10:24.760 --> 10:29.200]  we told you it was coming, they have personally said that I should be arrested in major British
[10:29.200 --> 10:33.920]  newspapers, they say it on a weekly basis about Lord Monkton, they talk about Mark Moreno,
[10:33.920 --> 10:38.480]  they actually had wanted signs in Paris when he premiered his film a few months ago there
[10:38.480 --> 10:46.760]  in Paris and you're like oh they're just joking around, no they're not.
[10:46.760 --> 10:52.240]  You saw what happened in Sacramento, two idiot groups in a fight with each other but here's
[10:52.240 --> 10:56.000]  the difference, at least the neo-Nazis were anti-globalists and understand this country
[10:56.000 --> 11:03.040]  is being captured, the useful idiot racist bam group by any means necessary, it's really
[11:03.040 --> 11:07.160]  an anti-white group from our research, they ran around and began beating people with sticks
[11:07.160 --> 11:15.400]  and hitting them over the head and so while the white nationalist stabbed them back and
[11:15.400 --> 11:20.320]  so I'll tell you who's in the wrong here, it's the communists and by the way they are
[11:20.320 --> 11:26.080]  so Ford Foundation funded it is just ridiculous, the image of the police though in their black
[11:26.080 --> 11:31.680]  uniforms taking photos of who's stabbing who and who's hitting who, we're showing that
[11:31.680 --> 11:35.080]  right now on TV for TV viewers, please never forget if you're a new listener we're not
[11:35.080 --> 11:40.520]  just radio, we like to add an added dimension of documentation, infowars.com forward slash
[11:40.520 --> 11:44.600]  show and the TV stations around the country cable stations starting to pick up the show
[11:44.600 --> 11:49.000]  having really gone to that phase of launch yet because I've been so busy getting new
[11:49.000 --> 11:55.520]  reporters and adding crew but we've got cable station in Houston and some UHF and VHF and
[11:55.520 --> 11:59.040]  cable stations around the country, it's more than 20 right now I know but we're about to
[11:59.040 --> 12:05.320]  do a big pushing at hundreds, a lot of it's also funding but I'm going to digress from
[12:05.320 --> 12:10.360]  there everybody knows infowars is exponentially growing and reaching more people especially
[12:10.360 --> 12:14.640]  when it comes to the internet itself that's why the federal government bought out by foreign
[12:14.640 --> 12:19.200]  interest isn't just pushing with the democrats to arrest people that talk about man made
[12:19.200 --> 12:27.920]  global warming being a tax scam fraud, they are also coming out and pushing taxing by
[12:27.920 --> 12:34.040]  the mile with the magic boxes in the last 14, 15 years or so that magically fell into
[12:34.040 --> 12:40.360]  all the cars manufactured from North America to Europe to Japan to South Korea to China,
[12:40.360 --> 12:45.320]  global standardization by accident of little boxes that you pay for as part of the cost
[12:45.320 --> 12:52.000]  of the car to tax you by the mile but they're also going to keep the gas tax on top of it.
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.240]  I've been telling you that for 20 years it's now started in Europe, it's now started in
[12:56.240 --> 13:00.240]  many states like Oregon, now the Washington Post announces the whole East Coast is about
[13:00.240 --> 13:08.200]  to go together in a giant screw job of epic proportions and the attack on free speech
[13:08.200 --> 13:13.800]  just accelerates but we're going to be looking at all of that speaking of the devil. ABC
[13:13.800 --> 13:20.800]  News reports here's the headline UN says more Central Americans headed to US and right
[13:20.800 --> 13:24.640]  down in McCallum, Texas where two of our reporters are today and are going to be coming on the
[13:24.640 --> 13:33.960]  broadcast incidentally where two of our reporters are right now they just announced oh yeah
[13:33.960 --> 13:38.680]  there's hundreds of thousands from Latin America they just show up very legal the newscast
[13:38.680 --> 13:44.960]  admits but then they're just set up at the bus station by the border patrol and then
[13:44.960 --> 13:49.480]  they get given vouchers and they get sent to different areas of the country just released
[13:49.480 --> 13:53.960]  out into the open but sent to Democratic Party facilities to be set up put on welfare given
[13:53.960 --> 14:01.080]  driver's license remember a flashback about this two years ago back in June of 2014 Jakari
[14:01.080 --> 14:07.920]  Jackson and others showed you them admitting all this of course I can't go to Honduras
[14:07.920 --> 14:12.080]  I can't go to Chile I can't go to Central or South America and get anything free but
[14:12.080 --> 14:17.680]  it's like oh it's families with children and their husbands of course and others 70 percent
[14:17.680 --> 14:22.640]  of children and it doesn't matter if Kevin Pagan emergency management you know a person
[14:22.640 --> 14:29.320]  thinks it's okay it's not and no one covered this but Drudge two years ago and now it's
[14:29.320 --> 14:34.880]  oh in the local news oh we're just being loving we're helping and then don't forget this headline
[14:34.880 --> 14:39.080]  from a few months ago just ties in Obama administration in UN announced global police
[14:39.080 --> 14:46.400]  force to fight extremism in US the strong cities initiative and they're suing our pile
[14:46.400 --> 14:51.240]  and others that have a drunk driver happens to be illegal he takes them to jail and that's
[14:51.240 --> 14:59.800]  mean so isn't that just precious isn't that just the cutest thing you've ever seen in
[14:59.800 --> 15:04.560]  your life this is it people say oh the UN doesn't run things you know the US and Europe
[15:04.560 --> 15:11.360]  do yes the UN is the multinational group with the IMF the World Bank the World Trade Organization
[15:11.360 --> 15:16.040]  where multinational corporations set up boards and then they get governments to consolidate
[15:16.040 --> 15:22.040]  power into unions and then those unions waive their power to dictatorial unelected secret
[15:22.040 --> 15:31.560]  corporate boards and the EU parliament is admittedly ceremonial has no power it's advisory
[15:31.560 --> 15:39.160]  and then now the EU announced Sunday Soros came out and said quote we need to have an
[15:39.160 --> 15:45.320]  emergency reconstitution first the EU needs to go down but then it needs to be reconstituted
[15:45.320 --> 15:49.760]  into a super state and guess what the proposal is now out the Polish newspapers have gotten
[15:49.760 --> 15:56.560]  the proposal from the Hague in the Netherlands and guess what it says members that are still
[15:56.560 --> 16:02.400]  in are having their governments dissolves and their militaries dissolved and are going
[16:02.400 --> 16:07.880]  under EU command the militaries will still stand but will now have EU commanders that's
[16:07.880 --> 16:12.760]  just like when the Germans came into France and let the French army in place but put their
[16:12.760 --> 16:18.040]  commanders in place because the public went along with it they were called the VC French
[16:18.040 --> 16:24.160]  and I hammer that because Germany didn't really beat France in two weeks they didn't
[16:24.160 --> 16:28.720]  just really run over the Maginot line and the Blitzkrieg they had a deal with almost
[16:28.720 --> 16:34.200]  the entire general staff of the French to take over and turn power over to them and
[16:34.200 --> 16:38.760]  set it up in the south of France and they did but that's barely in the history books
[16:38.760 --> 16:46.320]  it's an absolute incontrovertible fact but that's what globalism is most of war is using
[16:46.320 --> 16:51.640]  your intelligence agencies to buy off foreign governments before you invade that's what
[16:51.640 --> 16:57.200]  they did to Iraq in 1991 and 90 and 2003 and then they have Panetta the former head of
[16:57.200 --> 17:01.800]  the CIA come out when Trump talks about it and go we didn't pay anybody off in Iraq that's
[17:01.800 --> 17:12.120]  ridiculous they paid Iraq off upwards of 60 billion dollars admittedly before during
[17:12.120 --> 17:22.840]  and after that so-called invasion in the first year that's admitted but that's how dumb
[17:22.840 --> 17:27.160]  they think you are and that's what they've done here they've come in and bought off the
[17:27.160 --> 17:31.520]  government and we're openly going under world government and they have an Atlantic treaty
[17:31.520 --> 17:39.600]  merging the NAU that was signed in secret in 2005 in Baylor University in Waco Texas
[17:39.600 --> 17:44.560]  by Vicente Fox Paul Martin and George W. Bush and it was even a local paper they signed
[17:44.560 --> 17:49.880]  a treaty it's secret then we two years later they are having the Banff meeting to ratify
[17:49.880 --> 17:56.200]  it in secret judicial watch Seuss gets 2000 plus pages I actually read or scanned all
[17:56.200 --> 18:02.360]  2000 pages and made the film in game and I show the pages with an admitting stealth integration
[18:02.360 --> 18:08.840]  to world government with the goals of the total corporate rule with the corporations
[18:08.840 --> 18:14.360]  voting and then having the heads of state agree executively to follow it and I made
[18:14.360 --> 18:20.480]  the film in game talk about sensational that's how this works that's how the TPP works that's
[18:20.480 --> 18:27.400]  how all this works and it's being done out in the open now and their answer is not a
[18:27.400 --> 18:32.320]  whole Europe hostage and plunge their stock market that they're already plunging the stock
[18:32.320 --> 18:37.560]  market you know Soros is running around saying British exit makes EU disintegration irreversible
[18:37.560 --> 18:42.400]  but again on the ashes of it he wants to build a super state so some will say well then you
[18:42.400 --> 18:45.520]  know this is actually a trap it's a setup no they're opportunists when they start losing
[18:45.520 --> 18:51.440]  one angle they jump to the other side their divide and conquer it's full spectrum dominance
[18:51.440 --> 18:56.520]  they fund ISIS and Al Qaeda they fight ISIS and Al Qaeda they fund the Arab Spring and
[18:56.520 --> 19:07.320]  they fight the Arab Spring order out of chaos but why we're winning is we're educating
[19:07.320 --> 19:11.240]  the public that there's really a corporate world shadow government who by the way wants
[19:11.240 --> 19:18.800]  you to be impoverished and controlled towards a eugenics phased out soft kill that's not
[19:18.800 --> 19:22.640]  rhetoric that's the truth you're seeing it all manifest everything I've told you word
[19:22.640 --> 19:28.640]  for word happening because it's a game plan not my opinion I wish I could say I just envisioned
[19:28.640 --> 19:33.800]  all this and I was psychic that's not the case everybody's got a sixth sense but it
[19:33.800 --> 19:37.640]  goes beyond that you got to know what you're looking at historically and it's all here
[19:37.640 --> 19:41.360]  you just got to admit it's happening then we can beat it but the good news is we're
[19:41.360 --> 19:44.520]  admitting world government we're admitting it's a talentarian we're admitting it's far
[19:44.520 --> 19:49.040]  removed illegitimate and lying once you get to that point only dictatorship can keep them
[19:49.040 --> 19:53.480]  in place and those always fall and the EU's now announcing a military dictate they're
[19:53.480 --> 20:00.280]  actually saying prepare for us to take over your governments I mean this is sensational

[24:26.080 --> 24:34.240]  just gauge it all and then going out and seeing the billboards and hearing the radio and seeing
[24:34.240 --> 24:40.400]  the entertainment TV shows and hearing people talk and seeing propaganda at every level
[24:40.400 --> 24:47.120]  and to see people captured in a scientific technotronic technocracy that's the elite's
[24:47.120 --> 24:54.080]  name for worldwide scientific dictatorship just Google Davos calls for scientific dictatorship
[24:54.080 --> 25:00.800]  you'll get articles with them saying that six years ago club of Rome wrote about it
[25:00.800 --> 25:09.880]  in the 1963 I used to go to the microfilm at the UT library and pull this stuff out
[25:09.880 --> 25:16.520]  just to come read it on air and people didn't believe me in 1996 97 98 so I said I'm going
[25:16.520 --> 25:20.280]  to try to have a webcam that's good enough to show people these newspaper printouts
[25:20.280 --> 25:25.280]  and these documents because back when they thought they had the public in the 60s man
[25:25.280 --> 25:28.680]  they were like we're going to have UN trips on the streets we're going to take all the
[25:28.680 --> 25:35.320]  guns we're going to end the family this was in the Washington Post we're going to have
[25:35.320 --> 25:41.600]  10 FEMA regions I wish I could find that it's somewhere in my archives which is a bunch
[25:41.600 --> 25:49.000]  of storage facilities try to consolidate from like seven of them down to three and the actual
[25:49.000 --> 25:57.640]  New York Times actual New York Times I had the microfilm of it and then it was Bernadine
[25:57.640 --> 26:03.160]  Smith she ran the Second Amendment Foundation out in California that lady mailed me the
[26:03.160 --> 26:08.840]  actual New York Times from 1937 with the 10 regions of FEMA folks they didn't set that
[26:08.840 --> 26:17.720]  up till 1979 I mean these people aren't playing around and I'm sitting here here's the alum
[26:17.720 --> 26:21.640]  here's the allegory here's the parable here's the parallel here's here's the comparison
[26:21.640 --> 26:27.880]  it'd be like if I was a police detective and they get a call about a home disturbance the
[26:27.880 --> 26:32.080]  police go out there and a guy has killed his wife with a meat cleaver they're going to
[26:32.080 --> 26:37.920]  go ahead and take him into jail he's going to get charged with probably capital murder
[26:37.920 --> 26:42.680]  of its if it's if it's premeditated they go ahead and search the house they go down in
[26:42.680 --> 26:48.320]  the basement and they see photos of all these women tied up they're gonna start pulling
[26:48.320 --> 26:56.240]  the floor up and they find 25 bodies I mean there's not a debate they found 25 bodies
[26:56.240 --> 27:00.760]  and the neighbors though in most cases have Stockholm syndrome or just are in total denial
[27:00.760 --> 27:11.520]  they'll never believe Harvey or Bob was such a nice man
[27:11.520 --> 27:15.520]  and I'm sitting here with all the admitted evidence I mean just it's out in the open
[27:15.520 --> 27:20.600]  the EU is unelected I'm gonna say it again the EU is unelected the United Kingdom didn't
[27:20.600 --> 27:25.120]  vote to enter it it's now I'm gonna cover this in the next segment it's I have the article
[27:25.120 --> 27:31.280]  right here it's now threatening to dissolve and Kurt's article is good but it just should
[27:31.280 --> 27:39.640]  be bombshell EU moves to dissolve member state militaries goes into full coomode dissolving
[27:39.640 --> 27:45.880]  what I mean it's like in Star Wars Episode 4 when Governor Tarkin can we cue that up
[27:45.880 --> 27:49.880]  one of the movie clip sites Governor Tarkin walks into the Death Star and Darth Vader
[27:49.880 --> 27:56.960]  comes walking in and they're arguing about how to control the local you know star systems
[27:56.960 --> 28:01.760]  with the governors and with the local councils and Governor Tarkin says we're dissolving
[28:01.760 --> 28:06.800]  the regional councils he says that's impossible how will the impermaintain control with the
[28:06.800 --> 28:15.800]  regional governors in fear of this battle station the equivalent of a nuclear weapon
[28:15.800 --> 28:22.560]  we actually have them putting out an official memorandum saying you're not allowed to leave
[28:22.560 --> 28:29.680]  and we're going to dissolve your militaries that's their response to eight member nations
[28:29.680 --> 28:35.160]  saying they're moving for referendum within two days of that they come out and say we
[28:35.160 --> 28:40.560]  are preparing to take over your military standby and then the mainstream you'll go it's totally
[28:40.560 --> 28:46.320]  normal the EU showed up in the next few months oh they're commander oh and guess who the EU
[28:46.320 --> 28:53.720]  commanders already are NATO where Hitler couldn't succeed NATO is about to succeed in a total
[28:53.720 --> 29:00.800]  European dictatorship and just like just like part three just like Russia was in a fight
[29:00.800 --> 29:05.480]  in World War one with the Germans and World War two and the German globalist run the EU
[29:05.480 --> 29:11.400]  now here it is again they're busy starting a war with the Russians yet again with a bunch
[29:11.400 --> 29:16.840]  of warmongering weirdo feminist women running a whole show at our Pentagon State Department
[29:16.840 --> 29:22.720]  who've never been in combat never been in the military never killed anybody and I'm
[29:22.720 --> 29:27.880]  not saying that because they can't commit atrocities aren't tough oh no no it's so dangerous to
[29:27.880 --> 29:35.120]  have people in the positions of starting wars who've never been in a war boy that spells
[29:35.120 --> 29:42.320]  disaster you got a bunch of weird cocky women with big giant tin-carat diamond rings at
[29:42.320 --> 29:47.600]  the State Department talking about murdering Russians and body bags and swaggering around
[29:47.600 --> 29:56.000]  that's crazy we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[29:56.000 --> 30:04.880]  finally the mainstream media is reporting on what we broke two years ago US Customs and
[30:04.880 --> 30:08.840]  Border Patrol under pressure from the Obama administration is purchasing bus tickets for
[30:08.840 --> 30:12.720]  illegals to ship them deeper in the country at taxpayers expense local new station car
[30:12.720 --> 30:17.160]  GV is now covering how the McAllen Texas bus station is used as a transit hub for illegals
[30:17.160 --> 30:22.320]  Obama is bringing into the country which info wars.com exclusively broke in 2014 when no
[30:22.320 --> 30:26.720]  one else dared to report on it. KRGV revealed that over 100 legals a day are being dropped
[30:26.720 --> 30:32.040]  off at the McAllen station and in 2014 info wars report on how the Obama administration
[30:32.040 --> 30:35.560]  was ordering the Border Patrol to release illegals they've apprehended after crossing
[30:35.560 --> 30:39.680]  the border but as part of their release the legals are transported to the McAllen bus
[30:39.680 --> 30:44.000]  station by Border Patrol agents who then buy them tickets to go wherever they want to go
[30:44.000 --> 30:48.360]  in the US so for example if the legals have relatives in Boston that's where they get
[30:48.360 --> 30:53.040]  to go and taxpayers are paying for this illegal smuggling operation to find out more about
[30:53.040 --> 31:00.600]  Obama's lawlessness visit info wars.com this is Kit Daniels reporting.

[33:40.840 --> 33:46.640]  Lord Moncton is not just the champion globally exposing manmade global warming and the carbon
[33:46.640 --> 33:56.640]  tax is a world government totalitarian fraud and taxation scam he is undoubtedly the chief
[33:56.640 --> 34:01.760]  long term resistor of the EU dictatorship.
[34:01.760 --> 34:12.640]  You can say that Nigel Farage is now the leader of the anti-EU tyranny movement and what's
[34:12.640 --> 34:19.840]  so exciting about this is they only began to be Euro skeptics Moncton 30 years ago but
[34:19.840 --> 34:24.320]  Farage 25 years ago they've only been politically active 20 and they've already had the fastest
[34:24.320 --> 34:28.280]  growing party not just in the UK but Europe and just had one of the biggest political
[34:28.280 --> 34:32.840]  victories for sovereignty and what this is going to lead to is the equivalent of Declaration
[34:32.840 --> 34:42.120]  of Independence July 4, 1776 the will to do this having the leadership being in the right
[34:42.120 --> 34:47.520]  will win the war we're in the right we can't lose and this is as big as 1776 in the whole
[34:47.520 --> 34:54.720]  chain of Magna Carta 1776 this event and I'm not just saying that even the globalists
[34:54.720 --> 35:00.160]  are saying this is one of the biggest events in history we're going to explain why but
[35:00.160 --> 35:04.560]  we knew this was coming as soon as I saw this this morning I went oh my god Lord Moncton
[35:04.560 --> 35:09.120]  has hammered this over and over again a plan to get rid of nation state armies.
[35:09.120 --> 35:14.840]  Kurt Neumann wrote a story where the Polish papers have gotten the EU plan in their quote
[35:14.840 --> 35:19.120]  emergency reorganization for a quote super state to now tell countries before they can
[35:19.120 --> 35:23.120]  leave we're just going to take your military over why not they already make all the laws
[35:23.120 --> 35:32.000]  and aren't elected and then one of our writers put this report out June 23rd Kit Daniels
[35:32.000 --> 35:35.480]  ran in and brought to my attention he said Alex we wrote about this last week proposed
[35:35.480 --> 35:40.600]  EU army hidden from British voters until after Brexit EU army proposal remain hidden
[35:40.600 --> 35:45.280]  from British voters until day after brings a vote this was the day before the vote ladies
[35:45.280 --> 35:50.520]  and gentlemen this is so unprecedented when I'm reading the actual EU proposal I can't
[35:50.520 --> 35:56.040]  believe it it's like seeing Hitler invade France or Czechoslovakia Poland I mean if
[35:56.040 --> 36:01.320]  you were alive at that time it's you're seeing it unfold and you I just don't know what to
[36:01.320 --> 36:05.880]  say at this point I mean I know they're criminals I know they're tyrannical but my God oh eight
[36:05.880 --> 36:13.080]  countries want to leave we're taking over your militaries what I mean we're gonna arrest
[36:13.080 --> 36:15.640]  Germans to criticize open borders we're gonna arrest Swedes we're going to Lord
[36:15.640 --> 36:19.320]  Mock just a moment I'm not gonna belabor this but we're listeners supported we're not
[36:19.320 --> 36:25.400]  sponsors supported 80% is listener we don't just have the very best products at some of
[36:25.400 --> 36:31.920]  the lowest prices out there we are the tip of the spear worldwide info wars is reaching
[36:31.920 --> 36:36.600]  the most people when it comes to fighting the new world order drudge overall reaches a lot
[36:36.600 --> 36:40.720]  more people in general and he's fighting them as well doing a great job I'm not here bragging
[36:40.720 --> 36:45.360]  hey we're one of the biggest ships in this fight I don't like being the main target I
[36:45.360 --> 36:51.360]  can tell you right now I want to see other people come on the stage but look the democratic
[36:51.360 --> 36:56.840]  platform now officially calls to pass laws to arrest climate change deniers that is daily
[36:56.840 --> 37:02.360]  caller in it today that's now in the platform they're wanting to arrest this man every day
[37:02.360 --> 37:06.560]  in the newspapers Lord Moncton they're coming for us and people say well we better give
[37:06.560 --> 37:12.640]  up no when they hang up signs in Paris saying arrest Mark Moreno for his film that's a badge
[37:12.640 --> 37:16.760]  of honor when communists show up to stab people that's a badge of honor like they did this
[37:16.760 --> 37:21.600]  is they're making their move we're going to Lord Moncton a moment all I'm saying is we
[37:21.600 --> 37:26.440]  have the hillary for prison shirts they sold out faster than I thought version to the collectors
[37:26.440 --> 37:31.040]  edition we've got smalls and xxl's and they're gone there's a few hundred left they're gonna
[37:31.040 --> 37:37.080]  be gone an 18 wheeler shows up made right here in America Wednesday and of course we sold
[37:37.080 --> 37:41.160]  out because they're 75% off when you buy a second shirt 50% off when you buy one they're
[37:41.160 --> 37:48.960]  at cost at $5 that's that's 75% off what they normally are so if you want to get those unfortunately
[37:48.960 --> 37:53.200]  of the three best selling sizes are sold out we'll get more of the new design and it's
[37:53.200 --> 37:59.760]  very similar in a few days now that doesn't really fund the operation what funds the operation
[37:59.760 --> 38:04.320]  is the water filtration systems everybody needs at import war store.com 10% off promo
[38:04.320 --> 38:08.760]  code water nobody should be drinking the tap water it's contaminated everywhere it's one
[38:08.760 --> 38:12.480]  of the biggest causes of cancer look it up for yourself we have the very best spectrum
[38:12.480 --> 38:17.120]  of about eight different brands that I use personally shower filters the pro max the
[38:17.120 --> 38:23.720]  lexapures all of them 10% off promo code water on all those systems and we have the rolls
[38:23.720 --> 38:29.680]  Royce of deep cleansing back in stock one of our best selling products but it's very
[38:29.680 --> 38:33.480]  hard to source these and have them at California standards which are basically almost impossible
[38:33.480 --> 38:38.840]  to pass but we've done it again and we have 20% off deep cleanse that's only running for
[38:38.840 --> 38:44.560]  two more days it's got concentrated zeolites organic cilantro organic milk thistle folvic
[38:44.560 --> 38:49.240]  acid and many other cleansing ingredients trilogy you name it that are known to pull
[38:49.240 --> 38:58.480]  toxins out of the body info wars life.com info wars store.com but this is such an incredible
[38:58.480 --> 39:02.480]  juncture you see our reporters about to be well they're actually in the Valley now or
[39:02.480 --> 39:07.560]  they admit the UN is running a program bringing refugees in from Latin America with no background
[39:07.560 --> 39:11.480]  check with TB and they had been on the news very legal they're loaded on buses to ship
[39:11.480 --> 39:15.720]  a democratic party facilities around the country to be given ID cards that's on ABC news like
[39:15.720 --> 39:21.800]  it's a good thing I mean what you see in Europe's happening here by stealth so our reporters
[39:21.800 --> 39:24.760]  are down there our reporters are at Bilderberg our reporters are out in California and folks
[39:24.760 --> 39:29.000]  are being attacked I mean they're everywhere we're building a true news organization and
[39:29.000 --> 39:33.480]  it's your support and spreading the word that's doing it so censorship's coming in they're
[39:33.480 --> 39:37.560]  trying to hand the internet over to the UN right now even though the United States and
[39:37.560 --> 39:43.680]  England as usual built it they are handing it over to the UN and the EU right now I mean
[39:43.680 --> 39:50.400]  that's that's in the Associated Press internet being handed over to globalist I mean see
[39:50.400 --> 39:54.640]  the move is happening now now I'm going to give Lord Monks in the floor until we end
[39:54.640 --> 40:03.560]  this hour I appreciate him coming on on very very short notice his website is scienceandpublicpolicy.org
[40:03.560 --> 40:07.840]  and he's published many of the top peer reviewed papers in the world some of the top read the
[40:07.840 --> 40:12.960]  top read paper on climate change in the world is his paper that's subscribed to by tens
[40:12.960 --> 40:19.440]  of thousands and they want to arrest him for that that is in the news today so a true hero
[40:19.440 --> 40:24.800]  he doesn't want to hear that we need to recognize that you know the George Washington's of our
[40:24.800 --> 40:29.160]  time and their people like Nigel Farage their people like and you can talk about other folks
[40:29.160 --> 40:34.800]  in England that fought tyranny and expanding on that you see Trump coming out you know
[40:34.800 --> 40:41.280]  Trump Farage 2016 a lot of folks are saying globally just as leadership and in our countries
[40:41.280 --> 40:45.640]  and our nations and our shared histories coming back together something the globalist hate
[40:45.640 --> 40:50.520]  our national flags coming back out political correctness under attack this is just a great
[40:50.520 --> 40:55.440]  time but they're counter striking with the most utilitarian garbage I've ever seen and
[40:55.440 --> 40:59.640]  it is now here the EU if you just joined us openly announcing that they're going to go
[40:59.640 --> 41:03.560]  into member states and take over their militaries and not let them leave they're using the words
[41:03.560 --> 41:08.560]  super state Lord Monkton you predicted it it's now documented I am I am faint of breath
[41:08.560 --> 41:13.320]  I mean I quite frankly I don't get butterflies when I'm speaking to a crowd of 10,000 people
[41:13.320 --> 41:19.800]  I have butterflies right now because I just feel the history is happening history was
[41:19.800 --> 41:26.200]  indeed made by the British people on the 23rd of June which is already being called independence
[41:26.200 --> 41:32.840]  day here in the UK and you might like to know Alex that the film independence day resurgence
[41:32.840 --> 41:39.640]  was very carefully timed so that it premiered in the UK on the 23rd of June and I've already
[41:39.640 --> 41:46.480]  seen it so there is a great movement afoot now of ordinary people the moment they get
[41:46.480 --> 41:51.400]  the chance to have their say and governments in Britain have been trying for decades to
[41:51.400 --> 41:56.000]  deny them the chance to have their say and in the end it was Nigel Farage to whom you've
[41:56.000 --> 42:01.800]  quite correctly paid tribute it was he who for decades has been at the frontline battling
[42:01.800 --> 42:09.320]  this he who transformed UKIP into a useful fighting machine he who terrified David Cameron
[42:09.320 --> 42:15.000]  so much before the last election that Cameron promised us a referendum in the hope of getting
[42:15.000 --> 42:21.440]  just enough votes to win which he got but then he had to hold the referendum he promised
[42:21.440 --> 42:26.560]  and he couldn't win that because the British people have spoken and they've spoken decisively
[42:26.560 --> 42:33.880]  enough 52% to 48 and as our former Prime Minister William Pitt said and he said this
[42:33.880 --> 42:40.120]  just after we'd won the Napoleonic War a previous victory against an over mighty totalitarian
[42:40.120 --> 42:43.560]  I almost mentioned Pitt when I was talking about British style towards Washington's
[42:43.560 --> 42:50.120]  go ahead well let's let's give the quote that he gave in his speech to the mansion house
[42:50.120 --> 42:55.720]  dinner just before his death it was the last speech he made it was his shortest and his
[42:55.720 --> 43:02.400]  most eloquent all he said was England has saved herself by her exertions and will as
[43:02.400 --> 43:10.440]  I trust save Europe by her example and I think we are now seen very widely throughout Europe
[43:10.440 --> 43:17.000]  as being the voice of reason and sense and liberty against this increasingly cloying
[43:17.000 --> 43:25.600]  and increasingly aggressive totalitarian EU and of course the left which are totalitarian
[43:25.600 --> 43:32.080]  by instinct and by their belief they welcome the idea that the likes of you and me Alex
[43:32.080 --> 43:36.840]  should be locked up for pointing out that the world is not getting warmer at anything
[43:36.840 --> 43:41.760]  like the rate that the left had predicted that the intergovernmental panel on climate
[43:41.760 --> 43:46.760]  change effectively a communist organization they predicted a rate of warming that simply
[43:46.760 --> 43:53.360]  hasn't come to pass it's not happening so now here we have a proposal again from the
[43:53.360 --> 44:00.360]  left in the EU this time to bring forward the proposal for a so-called EU army by which
[44:00.360 --> 44:06.680]  they make all the armies of the member states into one army commanded of course by the unelected
[44:06.680 --> 44:11.520]  commissars not the answerable to any elected parliament so people start saying you're taking
[44:11.520 --> 44:15.880]  over you're arresting people you're not letting have speech your tax exempt their answer is
[44:15.880 --> 44:19.880]  we're going to take your army over I mean that's true occupation is it not well it is
[44:19.880 --> 44:25.880]  indeed and what what we have got here is now a gallop towards formal dictatorship and the
[44:25.880 --> 44:32.600]  question is whether there are still enough independent minded media around to speak out
[44:32.600 --> 44:38.360]  you won't hear a word of criticism of this on the BBC for instance and this is a big
[44:38.360 --> 44:42.360]  problem the media have been captured by these people so let me ask you this because you've
[44:42.360 --> 44:46.120]  worked in media you've been a top newspaper editor top adviser to Margaret Thatcher just
[44:46.120 --> 44:49.840]  briefly and they get back to the I mean this is really a dictatorship openly announcing
[44:49.840 --> 44:53.440]  itself not since Hitler invaded in my view that we've seen a threat this serious not
[44:53.440 --> 44:56.480]  even the Soviet Union because people knew that's an outside group it didn't have much
[44:56.480 --> 45:02.840]  of a chance but but but specifically the arrogance the boldness of the left the radical islamicist
[45:02.840 --> 45:08.360]  these imams that call for violence supporting the EU I mean it's really just a crew of
[45:08.360 --> 45:15.400]  motley trash well what has happened is that the governing class worldwide the class politic
[45:15.400 --> 45:21.360]  as the French call it they have been making common totalitarian cause you've got the
[45:21.360 --> 45:26.640]  two kinds of totalitarianism the corporatists who like to be involved with big business
[45:26.640 --> 45:30.640]  and get big business to go along with them those are the fascists then you've got the
[45:30.640 --> 45:36.400]  communists the the open collectivists and that they're now finding common cause for
[45:36.400 --> 45:41.520]  the first time they battled each other in the 20th century but now they are standing
[45:41.520 --> 45:48.120]  together against liberty and that's the significance of this European army move it's that they're
[45:48.120 --> 45:54.520]  so desperate they know that the peoples of Europe do not love them they know that they
[45:54.520 --> 46:01.680]  have failed to deliver what would we would regard as useful European government so they
[46:01.680 --> 46:07.400]  are now panicking and saying how can we cling by the fingernails to this empire of bureaucracy
[46:07.400 --> 46:12.720]  that we have created even though it's hated by the peoples of Europe and the answer of
[46:12.720 --> 46:17.600]  course is to get the governing elites of Europe to join together just as they did in trying
[46:17.600 --> 46:24.040]  to bully us into voting for staying in the European Union and that failed so now they're
[46:24.040 --> 46:29.120]  going to do it by force just as in the United States as you rightly point out there's a
[46:29.120 --> 46:33.680]  growing movement and it's now almost official part of the democratic platform but anybody
[46:33.680 --> 46:39.080]  who actually comes out and says hang on a moment there are serious scientific problems
[46:39.080 --> 46:44.880]  with this climate change nonsense can be arrested and detained and put on trial for that but
[46:44.880 --> 46:50.960]  here's the difficulty for as long as they're still talking about putting people on trial
[46:50.960 --> 46:55.040]  there is at least the chance that you might get a fair trial because the great thing about
[46:55.040 --> 47:01.720]  a trial is that both sides are hurt the danger with the European army proposal is that there
[47:01.720 --> 47:08.080]  is no court to whom anyone in Europe can appeal if their if their governing class decides
[47:08.080 --> 47:13.520]  to go down this route because then that common European army will be established and let
[47:13.520 --> 47:20.720]  us be quite clear it aim is not to do what NATO does to protect the member states of
[47:20.720 --> 47:25.680]  NATO so that if any one of those states is invading its aim is to keep countries within
[47:25.680 --> 47:33.920]  the system they admit it's aid this is an internal army designed to suppress the will
[47:33.920 --> 47:40.960]  of the people and keep them cowering in fear and to kick down the door just like the KGB
[47:40.960 --> 47:46.880]  if the people disagree with them that is what the European army is about that's why they
[47:46.880 --> 47:53.040]  want a European army as well as NATO because NATO already deals with the external defence
[47:53.040 --> 47:57.520]  of Europe it's NATO that's kept the peace and kept the Russians and everybody else
[47:57.520 --> 48:04.720]  at bay so why do they need a European army as well as NATO answer because NATO is explicitly
[48:04.720 --> 48:11.680]  forbidden to police the internal affairs of member states and member states contribute
[48:11.680 --> 48:17.680]  to NATO it's not commanded by NATO itself so it goes back to the more republic strategy
[48:17.680 --> 48:21.840]  but in the military coalition the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Lord Monkton we're gonna
[48:21.840 --> 48:25.440]  skip this network breaks we have more time I wanted to get hit Daniels briefly one of our
[48:25.440 --> 48:30.320]  writers that's been writing about this and we have another writer Clifford Cunningham
[48:30.320 --> 48:35.680]  who wrote about this last week proposed EU army hidden from British voters until after Brexit
[48:35.680 --> 48:40.640]  and then right after they they bring it out just showing the amazing stealth of this kid Daniels
[48:41.200 --> 48:45.920]  yes Alex uh yesterday it was on Thursday I believe I posted this article from our new guy
[48:45.920 --> 48:51.760]  Clifford Cunningham and now this is before Brexit even happened he said that as citizens of the
[48:51.760 --> 48:56.480]  United Kingdom prepare for the cast or votes in a nationwide referendum to decide whether or not
[48:56.480 --> 49:02.240]  to leave the European Union a plan detailing the initial framework of the creation of the EU army
[49:02.240 --> 49:07.120]  is being kept hidden from the public until the day after the vote so now the EU bureaucrats are
[49:07.120 --> 49:12.960]  claiming that this whole EU army program is a response to Brexit but this proves that it was
[49:12.960 --> 49:18.160]  not at all they had this plan for months but that exactly but but I mean isn't it even more
[49:18.160 --> 49:23.840]  outrageous Lord Monkton than going back to kept briefly Daniels that that their answer is
[49:23.840 --> 49:29.200]  we're not going to let you leave I mean I'm reading the draft of it and it says we're
[49:29.200 --> 49:33.200]  going to keep you in we're one shared common group basically we're going to make it harder
[49:33.200 --> 49:37.680]  for you to leave they're admitting that hey you didn't get the vote to enter this we're
[49:37.680 --> 49:42.480]  unelected and we're going to let you leave now this this European army idea has in fact been
[49:42.480 --> 49:48.160]  kicking around for a long time and it's been gathering dust but also gathering momentum
[49:48.160 --> 49:54.720]  among the totalitarian left because they since the fall of fascism and communism the left have
[49:54.720 --> 50:01.920]  not had armies like that of Hitler and of Stalin at their disposal and so they want they they
[50:01.920 --> 50:07.520]  realize now they cannot out argue us they cannot speak against democracy and expect to be heard
[50:07.520 --> 50:14.000]  by democracy they tried that and even with all the elite backing only one side of the vote it's
[50:14.000 --> 50:20.480]  the other side the democratic side that carried the day in Britain so now although I was born in
[50:20.480 --> 50:26.560]  a democracy I do not live in one I shall die in one so the British people have won that but the
[50:26.560 --> 50:32.960]  response it's not a response to Brexit this European army plan it's been around for for actually at
[50:32.960 --> 50:39.680]  least 15 years amazing and gathering momentum all that time and as I say the significance of this
[50:39.680 --> 50:45.200]  European army and the fact that only now are they admitting the latest stage in its development as
[50:45.200 --> 50:50.320]  they knew perfectly well that there will be an even larger negative vote against the if this
[50:50.320 --> 50:56.240]  come out in public this just shows how little they care for ordinary people think I want to go back
[50:56.240 --> 51:00.080]  to you and I want to go back to you in a moment I want to have kit be able to chime back in one
[51:00.080 --> 51:03.760]  more time because he's been on this beat writing about it but then I want to ask you montan so
[51:03.760 --> 51:08.800]  ruminate on this for about a minute you've told us which shoe is going to drop next years before
[51:08.800 --> 51:13.440]  it happened please tell us what you expect from the EU next what their scams are going to be
[51:13.440 --> 51:17.280]  how we counter this and do you agree with me that regardless it's it's one of the biggest
[51:17.280 --> 51:23.280]  victories in modern history against totalitarianism because we force the fact that yes we don't get to
[51:23.280 --> 51:27.840]  vote you're unelected world government's now out in the open we've got world leaders like
[51:27.840 --> 51:32.800]  donald trump and isle forage talking about megabanks i mean it seems to me this is just
[51:32.800 --> 51:39.360]  uh absolutely devastating events that in the end will sink these people but just like hitler
[51:39.360 --> 51:44.080]  didn't know he was beaten at leningrad or to battle the bulge and the r dens they're still
[51:44.080 --> 51:48.640]  going to fight on for a while so i want to get your take lord mongton in just a moment a finishing
[51:48.640 --> 51:53.680]  up kit other points yeah i'm working on an article right now alex i saw seen in yesterday
[51:53.680 --> 52:00.000]  and they brought in a former ambassador christopher hill who uh who said quote the only way to make
[52:00.000 --> 52:05.680]  europe more than the sum of member state diplomacy is to make it into a real state multi-level
[52:05.680 --> 52:10.400]  governance that may be just about satisfactory for managing mountains of butter but is barely
[52:10.400 --> 52:15.120]  suitable for making decisions about guns and cnn brought this guy on as a as a quote interview
[52:15.120 --> 52:19.600]  but it's a little more than a propaganda piece let me respond to that i think lord mongton's
[52:19.600 --> 52:26.800]  response to my three questions we can remember them look again you look at the EU it's always
[52:26.800 --> 52:31.040]  been there to destroy the nation states get them into debt and then fold them into super state
[52:31.040 --> 52:36.320]  they wrote about that 50 years ago so their conspiracy is public to those that are learned
[52:36.320 --> 52:41.280]  it's not debatable the problem is the general public now begins to understand that this is a
[52:41.280 --> 52:46.240]  wicked organization but how do we take them to the next level to understand it's always been
[52:46.240 --> 52:53.440]  premeditated uh lord mongton the first thing to do is to understand that this has now become it
[52:53.440 --> 52:59.920]  didn't start as a premeditated attempt to take away democracy but it has rapidly become exactly
[52:59.920 --> 53:07.840]  that as the people who are behind all this realized how feeble the response of nation states would be
[53:07.840 --> 53:13.360]  when they needed to defend themselves and already what is happening as a result of this vote is
[53:13.360 --> 53:18.000]  that there are about three and a half to four million signatures on a petition demanding there
[53:18.000 --> 53:22.560]  should be a rerun of the referendum in britain because they don't like the result it'll be just
[53:22.560 --> 53:27.440]  like denmark and ireland where they were made to vote again and vote again until they got the
[53:27.440 --> 53:33.360]  result that the governing class wanted and only then was that referendum regarded as final the
[53:33.360 --> 53:38.720]  same thing is now being attempted even with the british people and i can tell you we're not going
[53:38.720 --> 53:44.080]  to like that very much we are going to oppose this very vigorously the more the governing
[53:44.080 --> 53:51.040]  establishment tries to discredit and dishonor and not to implement that referendum the more
[53:51.040 --> 53:56.880]  strongly the support for freedom will grow among ordinary people and eventually the conservative
[53:56.880 --> 54:03.040]  party which is deeply divided on this and half of which still wishes that it could overturn this
[54:03.040 --> 54:08.000]  referendum and simply carry on as though it hadn't happened you've got the whole of the labor party
[54:08.000 --> 54:14.000]  which is effectively communist under its present leader jeremy corbin now in disarray but the
[54:14.000 --> 54:22.160]  disarray is mainly due to an argument about how far they should push a reversal of the people's
[54:22.160 --> 54:28.800]  will but am i right though that the parliamentary bill that will be necessary to break us free of
[54:28.800 --> 54:33.440]  europe the referendum on its own doesn't do it parliament then has to do the people's will
[54:33.440 --> 54:39.360]  and with the likes of the labor party and the scottish national workers party all these parties
[54:39.360 --> 54:44.480]  that are left-wing the so-called liberal so-called democrats who are neither the so-called greens
[54:45.200 --> 54:50.320]  who are the destroyers of the planet these people they're all on the far left from i understand
[54:50.320 --> 54:56.560]  but long-term they are going to fight and fight and fight to make sure that they will use the
[54:56.560 --> 55:00.960]  majority that they can muster in parliament together with a whole lot of conservatives who
[55:00.960 --> 55:07.040]  aren't really conservative at all to vote down any bill to give effect so that's their next
[55:07.040 --> 55:12.000]  scam let me ask you this then that's going to be the next battle sure i mean just brief questions
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.560]  here fast because i want your view on this but do you agree with me though that the genies out of
[55:16.560 --> 55:22.720]  the bottle it's going to be a long fight but there's no way i mean unless it's a total dictatorship
[55:22.720 --> 55:25.920]  that they're ever going to be able to keep this thing in place how long until you think europe
[55:25.920 --> 55:31.680]  finally falls apart the people have spoken here in britain they haven't been allowed to speak
[55:31.680 --> 55:37.280]  almost everywhere else where they have been allowed to speak they have tended to be told to go and vote
[55:37.280 --> 55:42.800]  again and vote again until they get the answer the elites want that technique will no longer work
[55:42.800 --> 55:48.960]  there is now a need for something i've mentioned before which is an international grouping to advance
[55:48.960 --> 55:54.800]  the cause of liberty no longer if we stand alone as national parties will we be strong enough to
[55:54.800 --> 55:59.280]  defeat that's my next question about Trump totalitarian monster you've talked about an open
[55:59.280 --> 56:04.400]  society of governments and peoples working together in shared cause so that the globalists
[56:04.400 --> 56:08.560]  just don't act like they're the only ones trying to have humanity come together why have we given
[56:08.560 --> 56:15.520]  them that power we need something to counter that we do we now need a a freedom international i don't
[56:15.520 --> 56:21.280]  know what we'll call it but something like that which is a subscription membership party which
[56:21.280 --> 56:25.440]  everybody joins from america from britain from all the other countries of europe and the common
[56:25.440 --> 56:31.680]  world from everywhere else where liberty still matters because if we don't stand together now
[56:31.680 --> 56:37.120]  then we'll fall as i think it was benjamin franklin used to well hang separate we must all hang
[56:37.120 --> 56:42.960]  together or assuredly we shall all hang separately and listen i mean nigel farage i mean i cannot
[56:42.960 --> 56:47.760]  stress in yourself and the rest of the party uke coming from nowhere now the fastest growing party
[56:47.760 --> 56:53.360]  in europe uh other parties joining other parties picking up the nationalist rhetoric uh this is
[56:53.360 --> 56:58.960]  beautiful the pen all the rest of it i mean this is clearly rising and globally this could bring in
[56:58.960 --> 57:06.560]  the new renaissance remember that this is not a nationalist movement uke what uke is is a democratic
[57:06.560 --> 57:12.560]  freedom loving movement we are not there to say a nation state is the only way we can conduct our
[57:12.560 --> 57:18.400]  affairs we are there to say that a european superstate that we do not elect and that our people
[57:18.400 --> 57:23.440]  cannot control that is not the way forward for europe any modernities for our country where they
[57:23.440 --> 57:27.440]  arrest people for their speech where they where they eject themselves from taxes i mean it's a new
[57:27.440 --> 57:34.000]  royalty isn't it they exempt themselves from taxes worse they exempt themselves also from civil
[57:34.000 --> 57:40.240]  suit and from criminal prosecution and the the people who run the the the central stability
[57:40.240 --> 57:44.560]  yeah tell folks who these new sovereigns are on these on these bureaucracies and how they set
[57:44.560 --> 57:48.480]  those up briefly i mean this is amazing for instance the european stability pact is a good
[57:48.480 --> 57:53.200]  example this is the thing that was intended to address the collapse in the euro which is still
[57:53.200 --> 57:58.960]  of course collapsing and will collapse still faster now that britain's voted out but uh they set up
[57:58.960 --> 58:05.680]  a governing body of absolute bankers and these bankers have have been given by the treaty establishing
[58:05.680 --> 58:12.960]  the stability pact total immunity from civil suit or criminal prosecution for any actions they take
[58:12.960 --> 58:20.080]  and one of their actions that they are empowered by this treaty to take is to order any member state
[58:20.080 --> 58:26.320]  of the stability pact fortunately not interesting britain to hand over any amount of money that they
[58:26.320 --> 58:30.320]  demand that's the bail in as soon as they demand it and that's how they're able to install leaders
[58:30.320 --> 58:35.440]  too that that's how they're able to tell uh you know places like greece uh or idli hey you know here's

[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:28.800]  all right again i get upset i start hyperventilating when we sit here and see open tyranny being
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:33.200]  shut up and the general public's in a coma i don't normally disagree with lord mongton
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.320]  because he's one of the leading experts on the eu tyranny and advise margaret that's your honor
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:44.160]  to oppose going into it and you know spoke out against it i mean this is an unelected bureaucracy
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:48.080]  of megabanks taking over countries and installing leaders but just a closing comment from him and
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:52.880]  then one from kit daniels ahead of our next guest we're gonna supreme court rulings and and moron
[01:00:52.880 --> 01:00:58.960]  brings it coming up i look at the euro how they claim they set it up as a you know steel trade
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:04.320]  deal then economic commission and all this from and i've seen some of the leaders of the euro admit
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:10.720]  it was set up to consolidate control i think it's been a tyranny from the beginning and and certainly
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:14.240]  is a naked tyranny now i mean why do you say it wasn't started as a tyranny lord mongton
[01:01:15.120 --> 01:01:20.160]  i did originally at least this was the official declared purpose let's be clear about this as
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:24.720]  a means of it was called the european colon steel community its job was to make sure there was enough
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:29.040]  colon steel to rebuild europe after the second world war that was it that was the treaty of
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:34.720]  london and the and 48 wasn't it and then in 56 the treaty of rome and the treaty of rome was where
[01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:42.240]  it began to diverge from that original purpose and because the treaty that set up the colon steel
[01:01:42.240 --> 01:01:47.040]  community was a purely technocratic treaty just to make sure there's enough colon steel to go around
[01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:52.880]  that didn't need to be run democratically but the people who then decided they would try and
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:59.680]  create a european superstate moved in people like john monne and they quite explicitly said well we
[01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:05.360]  don't want democracy what we want is the governing elites to come together and form a europe which we
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:11.200]  the dictators will run and by the way the german the german president just interrupt lost the war
[01:02:11.200 --> 01:02:16.960]  or then promptly moved in and tried to do bureaucratically what they couldn't do by force of arms
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:22.400]  and that that has been the continuing problem with it ever since and that is why in the end
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:27.120]  the likes of me who at first were in favor of the free trade area which the european union
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:32.160]  originally was and it was just the european communities we turned against it when it began
[01:02:32.160 --> 01:02:37.120]  galloping towards being the the suit exactly everyone can now see it becoming and in closing
[01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:42.160]  let me ask you this question info wars dot com story german president there's video says the elites
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:47.120]  are not the problem this is a quote the populations of the problem close quote are these people
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:52.240]  completely mentally ill why are they so arrogant why do they admit everything about world government
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:57.920]  but then have their media say it doesn't exist they are so arrogant precisely because the media
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:03:03.360]  have been so comprehensively captured and if there's one book you need to read to work out how this
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:09.840]  was done then it's eon mihi paciapa who was the head of the security party uh the chow under
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:16.320]  chowskis romania and he headed the disinformation directorate of the kgb whose sole function
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:20.960]  was to denigrate and destroy the reputations of all the enemies of communism throughout europe
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:29.440]  and they managed to recruit a million european communists that's right to help out in and even
[01:03:29.440 --> 01:03:35.040]  after they fell that the brainwash european communists have continued the mission they have
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:40.000]  indeed continued the mission uh even though paciapa eventually defected to the west and wrote a book
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:44.240]  saying that there were a million of them when i tell people it was that many they express shock
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:48.160]  and they just think i'm some kind of reds under the beds merchant but the phrase reds under the
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:53.360]  beds was invented by paciapa it was invented as well sure they declassified a bunch of kgb files
[01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:57.440]  a few years ago and it was all documented in fact why don't you review that book for us and come back
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:02.560]  on and do a full hour about the controlled media in the future science of public policy.org we salute
[01:04:02.560 --> 01:04:06.880]  you congratulations lord mongton and thank you for your fight it's got to feel good to come from
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:11.040]  nowhere in the last 30 years and you and ferrage and others to be leading a global movement uh
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:15.360]  that i just feel honored to be part of sir and trump is as well well god bless you and thank
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:19.840]  you for your help alex it's been absolutely vital well thank you it's amazing we're not lying down
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:24.240]  that's for sure uh kit thank you for riding shotgun with us more articles and info wars
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:29.520]  quick comment kit daniel's it's interesting now what you said earlier that the eu is a nazi program
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:35.360]  now it's interesting to point out that the uh nazi germany was not a technocracy but they did put
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:40.400]  technocrats in power that's what the trilateral commission grew out of in the 70s you know you
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:44.800]  had two separate movements the u.s. technocracy and the german technocracy the german technocracies
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:51.600]  would survive i think the u.s. technocracy died in the 30s at the outbreak war two so yeah it's
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:57.600]  like not adolf iller was the last person to create a european super state so yeah this is a nazi
[01:04:57.600 --> 01:05:02.400]  it's incredible thank you kit thank you lord mongdom both g lp nominee donald trump and leftist
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:06.960]  investor george soros have predicted the complete downfall to european union despite trump being a
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:11.360]  nationalist and soros a globalist the two billionaires both independently declared that they believe a
[01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:15.440]  domino effect has been started by britain's decision to leave the u and the process will be
[01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:20.480]  difficult for anyone to stop as reported by steve watson soros said quote now the catastrophic
[01:05:20.480 --> 01:05:25.200]  scenario that many feared has materialized making the disintegration of the eu practically irreversible
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.200]  trump also predicted a complete breakup of the eu and also warned that the continent would be
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.760]  completely unrecognizable within 10 years if strict immigration controls are not enacted
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.560]  trump told reporters quote the people have spoken i think the eu is going to break up i think the eu
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:42.640]  might break up before anyone thinks in terms of scotland trump is referring to the resistance
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:47.120]  scottish politicians are still giving brexit he continued stating that i really think that
[01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:51.600]  without the immigration issue the eu wouldn't have had a chance of breaking up the people are fed up
[01:05:51.600 --> 01:05:56.160]  whether it's here or in other countries you watch other countries will follow for more news visit

[01:07:37.200 --> 01:07:42.240]  solar generators and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:47.280]  addition to the low price for info wars listeners so it's a good time to check it out go to grid
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:52.960]  wars dot com that's grid wars dot com it's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:08:03.680]  with minimum money go to grid wars dot com that's grid wars dot com from his central
[01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:10.640]  texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues it's alex jones
[01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:20.080]  and the gcn radio network in 2007 i shot a whole bunch of videos we probably wrote 10 15 articles
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:27.760]  had guessed on the british ministry of defense came out and said that by 2016 2017 they began to
[01:08:27.760 --> 01:08:32.640]  believe that global collapse would happen and that hundreds of millions was starved to death
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:39.440]  there'd be huge mobs all over the world basically burning things down i didn't say that i'm not really
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:44.960]  a fear porn dealer but i do respect the british ministry of defense and a declassified portion
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:50.400]  of that 23 page report was put out the london guardian picked it up the headline was flash mobs
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:57.440]  and brain chips in your future then about two years later it turned out that was a report on
[01:08:57.440 --> 01:09:05.040]  a us report that in 2009 got partially declassified saying that global food production and other
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:09.840]  issues were going to cause a massive deficit that would begin in africa in the middle east and
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:16.640]  cause revolution and they predicted it in around the year 2010 which happened right on time and
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:21.600]  then it went on from there to describe the rest of the collapse of the world i was attacked by the
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:26.160]  new york times you name it that i i was the fair monger saying that it's like when they have
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:34.720]  a major publication come out like the army times admit they're doing army drills and we point out
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:40.240]  hey it shows the us uh you know as they're targeting says texas hostile is this more conditioning
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:45.040]  to accept military on the streets and then they say that i said they were going to take over a
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:49.520]  few years ago and kill everybody that's not what i'm saying i'm saying what they're preparing for
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:54.960]  and i know a lot of military people you see a lot of them on the show and they talk about the
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:10:01.600]  preparations for civil unrest but hey vice of hbo has come out and said it oh my gosh drudge report
[01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:08.400]  has two links today it's up on info wars.com as well and we're going to our guest fema contractor
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:16.160]  predicts social unrest caused by 395 food price spikes now we predicted a 30 spike in the next
[01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:21.920]  year a few months ago when we offered 30 off they are to 40 off on info war select super high
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.400]  quality storeable food powered by my patreon we private label to give the lowest prices it's
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:31.920]  already the lowest prices at its regular price but we're doing 15 off i saw this this morning
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:36.560]  and i said look you know this will sell food people need food and that helps support the
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:40.800]  broadcast it's a win-win but i said this is scary and i've read this story several times
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.040]  we're going to cover it after joseph pharaoh leaves us but the u.s national security industry is
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:50.080]  planning for the impact of an unprecedented global food crisis lasting as long as a decade that is
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:56.080]  the exact pentagon report 2006 british report 2007 according to reports by government contractor
[01:10:56.080 --> 01:11:01.040]  the studies published by the cna corporation december 2015 oh you just learned up now
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:07.040]  unreported until now describe a detailed simulation of protracted global food crisis and it goes on
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:16.080]  yeah and it all starts in 2016 2017 accelerates through 2020 to 2030 we broke this we've basically
[01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:21.760]  broken everything and and yes you else has broken all this worldnet daily.com and listen i don't get
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.560]  paid to say that joseph pharaoh when they got the and i might kiss he hates us he wants to come on
[01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:29.680]  to cover news just please don't talk about me he said this before alex but i'm going to do it
[01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:35.280]  because i gotta just call out these heroes like drudge and lord montan martin rano and others
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.560]  when they did a four year request last year and got the thousands of pages from the clinton
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:49.120]  foundation from the clinton library it was all how to stop the new press in the future how to stop
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:53.440]  joseph pharaoh the western journalism center because if joseph pharaoh succeeds you know change
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:57.680]  the face of media and there'll be new independent media we've got to block liberals and conservatives
[01:11:57.680 --> 01:12:02.080]  we got to call them conspiracy theorists order the controlled media to do that so you we literally
[01:12:02.080 --> 01:12:08.640]  are getting the guy on that led the way to what drudge was able to do what we've done and what
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:12.320]  you're able to do some people say well i hope drudge gets shut down by the federal elections
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.400]  commission i hope you do i'll get bigger no they'll shut you down too and now they're handing the
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:21.520]  internet over to the u n that's in the washington post today so all i'm saying is everything we
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:25.760]  warned of is epically now happening so i want to ask joseph pharaoh and the limited time we have
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:31.120]  he's a busy guy i want to cover briggs it i want to cover trump with him but you know talk to one
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:37.920]  of the wise men out there a true patriot what point have we gotten to joseph wnd.com where
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:43.760]  everything we've talked about is now admitted our credibility is exploding but instead the globalist
[01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:48.240]  left just says they're going to arrest everybody and the democratic platform now says arrest climate
[01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:54.160]  change deniers i mean it's it's just crazy it's bizarre what is going on where do you think this
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:13:00.560]  is going well it's not going in a in a good direction that's for sure alex and thank you very
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:05.200]  much for having me on by the way i appreciate it we haven't visited for a while oh i had to twist
[01:13:05.200 --> 01:13:13.200]  your arm let's be honest i didn't think you liked me anymore but uh uh you know we're we're in a world
[01:13:13.200 --> 01:13:18.800]  of hurt i mean i don't know what else to say i mean there's not much good news on the horizon we we
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:25.360]  look for it every day so people don't go insane but it is hard to find there you know i think you
[01:13:25.360 --> 01:13:32.000]  talk about good news uh you know i think what we saw happen great britain uh uh last week was
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:37.840]  with some good news you know i think i think the people and it's not just people in the united
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:43.120]  states obviously are beginning to see so much of the kinds of things that we've been talking
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:49.040]  about that the terrible direction we've been going in and they're reacting as best they can the question
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:55.760]  is whether you know the ruling authorities are going to pay attention to the will of the people
[01:13:55.760 --> 01:14:02.320]  we've got an election coming up this year i think as as far as that goes uh i you know
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:08.000]  in the past uh you could argue whether there was a dime's worth of difference between the republican
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  nominee and the democratic nominee we we talked about that in 2004 and 2008 um and uh 2012
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:26.000]  and uh you know it was arguable uh it's not it's not even arguable it's not in this election
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:31.760]  there's trillions of dollars worth of difference between donald trump and hillary clinton would you
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:38.240]  agree oh there is light years of difference and we see the establishment showing that i mean
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:43.760]  they're they're they're so afraid why are they so afraid of trump well because he cannot be controlled
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:50.480]  i mean you know this is a guy who when he talks to the american people they listen uh he has and
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:55.440]  they you know the media cannot control this guy when i say he can't be controlled i'm really
[01:14:55.440 --> 01:14:59.440]  talking about the media because what are they going to do they have to stop covering him they
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.800]  have to stop putting him on tv that hurts their ratings when they do that you know now you're hitting
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:10.960]  them right in the bottom line and this is what is so spectacular i think about this election
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:18.640]  it's such a quantum difference from from you know the recent elections we've seen over many many years
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:23.680]  and he does know his timing because all over the world nationalists and patriots are getting in
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:28.960]  there's a popular surge so that was my earlier question the paradox of huge global awakening
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:33.920]  world government out in the open totalitarian and so people are really waking up but at the
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:40.000]  same time the left is re-entrenching and just getting more violent more bizarre more mentally
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:44.720]  ill more anti-free speech i mean you know i've been a big critic of the republic is just like
[01:15:44.720 --> 01:15:49.200]  you've been and and and some fake conservatives but with the left it seems like they've collectively
[01:15:49.200 --> 01:15:54.800]  gone completely insane well that's the danger we've always you know we've always seen the totalitarian
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:01.840]  nature of this you know movement that is they call themselves progressives i love that but that
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:09.200]  between quotes uh you know what what are they progressing toward is the big question and um
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:15.680]  you know but ultimately there we're seeing like never before that's a totalitarian nature of the
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:20.960]  left and so that we're living in very dangerous times here we're seeing uh you know at the same
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:28.160]  time we see the expression in great britain uh against globalism for independence for
[01:16:28.160 --> 01:16:33.760]  accountability from government uh we also see you know i'll just point to a headline today
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:41.280]  supreme court overturns a case in texas i wanted to bring that up to you and then they say oh when
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:46.480]  it's a split court it leans left so scala is magically out of the way and now here's kennedy
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:52.640]  again shooting down uh state laws but yeah what was going on in texas now i don't care whether you're
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:59.520]  you know pro-life pro-abortion whatever this the question on the table is does texas have
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:06.880]  the right the power as a state a sovereign state to require certain you know uh health
[01:17:06.880 --> 01:17:14.000]  and safety standards regarding abortion clinics that seems to me to be a no there's more regulations
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:20.640]  on a baskin robins than there is in the mortuary exactly right so the supreme court knows better
[01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:27.920]  how is that even you know it just defies all logic and we've seen this over and over again
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:36.560]  you know the totalitarian nature of this court uh it's it's it's manifest and so you know we're
[01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:42.240]  in the same position maybe even in a worse position than the british people were and we're you know
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:48.240]  it's not because we're necessarily part of a european union style situation no instead
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:54.080]  our charity is the supreme court that's right we're under the control of washington dc washington
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:18:02.000]  dc is acting sovereign over the states and over local jurisdictions and so forth it's just it's
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:09.040]  the situation is untenable and so you know washington exit mm-hmm like how do we do it
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:14.160]  is there a mechanism for that the it's called the constitution that's the mechanism but they
[01:18:14.160 --> 01:18:20.480]  just ignore it i mean the constitution strictly limits the power of the federal government
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:27.040]  but we don't see that and what about the checks and balances in the system you know isn't it
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:32.640]  supposed to be the legislative branch that makes the laws how often do we see this president
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:40.800]  effectively making laws issuing edicts to you know all 50 states arresting members of the press
[01:18:40.800 --> 01:18:47.280]  in fact i wanted to bring this next up to you i have abc news headline here where the united
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:54.000]  nations here's the headline i'm grabbing on the stack un this is abc news krgv more central americans
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.720]  headed to the us and they admit they're here illegally the un's running the program in central
[01:18:58.720 --> 01:19:03.440]  america they have a deal with mexico they ship them up here illegally and then they put them on
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:09.040]  buses inside the us and then ship them to democratic party facilities this is what we broke two years
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:14.080]  ago with our reporters they're coming up at the bottom of the hour they're in mcallin i mean the
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:18.560]  supreme court ruled to stop that he's violating the law so what so when he doesn't like what supreme
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:24.400]  court says he ignores it but when he does like it he goes for it right exactly right and you talk
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:30.240]  about the immigration issue this is ultimately i think what uh was the real catalyst above
[01:19:30.240 --> 01:19:37.680]  behind this brexit vote and here we are we're are we in better shape than they are or worse shape
[01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:44.960]  the only thing we're going to be able to do honestly from a pragmatic political standpoint
[01:19:44.960 --> 01:19:53.120]  is to elect donald trump in 2016 you know i can't say as i may have once uh suggested to people
[01:19:53.120 --> 01:19:59.040]  that it makes a heck of a big difference who we elect to congress we we did that in 2010
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:03.280]  how did that work out for us i was about to say you and i admitted that our failure
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:10.480]  and we were so sick of george w bush as more libertarian patriots that we sat out the 2008
[01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:15.360]  election because mccain was so horrible right but but i mean now look at what we've got because
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:20.560]  i mean mccain knew he was a shell he knew he was a fall guy like a donking boxing match and he
[01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:24.400]  knew he was there to take a dive but we should have just still elected that puppet because he's
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:28.800]  an old evil white guy he wouldn't have had the race car to play he couldn't have got any of this done
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:35.760]  exactly i mean you know in retrospect who knows but but the but the point is this you know what
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:41.040]  we need is not just shaking up washington by electing the president we've got it we've got to
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:48.720]  actually create or recreate an alternative political party in uh that you know in washington
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:54.160]  and i that's what i think trump is uniquely positioned to do uh and you know let me ask
[01:20:54.160 --> 01:20:59.840]  you a question alex do you believe these polls that are coming out now you know that he's 10
[01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:06.000]  points behind hillary and so forth what is your gut tell you i had a 30 minute conversation with
[01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:13.040]  roger stow yesterday quizzing him about another trump insider inside the campaign that i talked to
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:18.800]  him and he confirmed a lot of what i was told and it was it was it was so staggering that
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:23.040]  i wrote a bunch of notes and then never have not i haven't even covered it yet i was thinking
[01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.840]  about covering it next hour writing an article about it because you know you got a big story and
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:31.360]  you don't even know how to deal with it it's so big but uh he was he was confirming some of the
[01:21:31.360 --> 01:21:36.080]  internal polling they've done showing that trump's pretty much in a dead heat everywhere if they just
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:40.480]  do a fair poll you know if they cast it the way hillary's casting it the other way he's like 10
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:45.360]  points ahead and he went on to say in a lot of key states he's way ahead but he said many people
[01:21:45.360 --> 01:21:50.480]  are so intimidated people ask why is the left out stabbing people why are they out attacking
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:54.960]  why are they beating up old ladies when it makes them look so bad they don't care they want to scare
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:22:00.240]  you away from coming out to vote they want to scare you from saying you'll you're for trump
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:04.800]  they've done their numbers they've done their actuaries so the truth is from the polls they've
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:10.960]  done in focus groups uh they're thinking upwards of 10 to 14 percentage of people but they'd be
[01:22:10.960 --> 01:22:15.280]  democrat or republicans or non-voters that like you folks have been out of the system for a while
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:20.320]  that really trump's going to win with a reagan style landslide but they think hillary is just
[01:22:20.320 --> 01:22:24.640]  trying to act like she's really winning and having the media say it because they're looking at probably
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:30.480]  stealing the election well that exactly uh that is exactly what i have been saying now for for some
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:36.800]  time i believe that trump can can cause a political realignment in this country like we haven't seen
[01:22:36.800 --> 01:22:43.360]  since 1980 and what i don't base it on on on the polls because with the polls you've got to actually
[01:22:43.360 --> 01:22:48.240]  see how they were pushing but also exactly people are scared to say they're for trump that's why i
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:53.520]  wear a hat don't trump hat when i'm downtown around you know communist areas because i want to get it
[01:22:53.520 --> 01:23:00.640]  in their face and they run in fear sorry go ahead right my my uh my opinion has been based on the
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:07.600]  anecdotal uh relationships the experiences i have with people for instance i will tell you
[01:23:08.320 --> 01:23:13.840]  i have a sister an older sister who voted for obama enthusiastically last two elections i
[01:23:13.840 --> 01:23:21.360]  know i love her you know i just say she's misguided all her family like that yeah uh she is on fire
[01:23:21.360 --> 01:23:26.800]  for trump she can't wait to vote for trump and this has caused i don't know what it is about
[01:23:26.800 --> 01:23:33.040]  down i mean honestly because i you know i wish i had that magic to put with my own sister right
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:40.080]  and i see this over and over with people not just my relatives people i run into who you know you
[01:23:40.080 --> 01:23:48.560]  would think or you have reason to believe that they are democrats liberals progressives what have you
[01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:53.280]  and this is a this is a whole different ballgame for them trump the personality trump
[01:23:53.280 --> 01:24:00.880]  because of his outspokenness his forthrightness and look at that speech he gave about hillary
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:07.120]  last week what i mean that was amazing have we that proves he's for real that i mean right
[01:24:07.120 --> 01:24:12.480]  that he's so hardcore that shows he is definitely not a shill for hillary we know that now have we
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:20.080]  seen a republican presidential candidate go on the attack and it was not personal it was not
[01:24:20.080 --> 01:24:25.840]  if everything he said in that speech was dead accurate it was as if i mean it would you could
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:31.280]  have been listening to alex jones or joseph barra give that speech that's what we've got now look
[01:24:31.280 --> 01:24:37.680]  you know it's not i'm not saying donald trump is perfect i didn't even support him in the you know
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:44.400]  personally i was at ted cruz guy the truth is he's got too much of a liberal background but i i've
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:47.920]  gone back and done the research that was because he was doing business with these people and he's a
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:52.480]  nice guy and in many respects look at the whole gay issue he is somewhat liberal on some issues
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:56.960]  but the key is at least he's a nationalist that isn't out to get the country and wants a rising
[01:24:56.960 --> 01:25:02.400]  tide to raise all ships and you have to admit i think just objectively that he is bet he is in
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:09.120]  the best position to challenge this woman he because he will he will tell you exactly what
[01:25:09.120 --> 01:25:15.040]  she is and you know it's going to be up to that's why i say there's it's not a dime's worth a
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:21.680]  difference this time it's trillions and trillions of dollars it's probably the last chance we have
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:30.480]  to elect a president that's going to you know give us the chance not just to change direction but to
[01:25:30.480 --> 01:25:35.440]  do a 180 and i really believe that's the opportunity and that's why they're so scared of him that's why
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:39.840]  i say he's unelectable couldn't get the nomination above the law because they know he's the best
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:44.320]  candidate their fear you know shows us that something is rotten the state of denmark let me
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.320]  ask you this question because you know i was here a smart news guy who had the instincts and vision
[01:25:48.320 --> 01:25:52.240]  the whole internet you know resistance the whole nine yards when the founding fathers the current
[01:25:52.240 --> 01:25:57.200]  you know a wave of a liberty worldwide joseph ferrett joining us here today w&d.com
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:26:01.680]  um what do we hammer on most i don't think there's been enough talk about how
[01:26:01.680 --> 01:26:04.960]  she sold us out to the communist chinese with the missile secrets let me just throw that out at you
[01:26:04.960 --> 01:26:09.840]  what about this what about hammering the point that i know you've done this but but i mean that
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:14.000]  she gets a hundred million dollars from gulf states that keep women as prisoners but then
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.760]  runs and executes homosexuals then she runs around to gay pride parades i mean the hypocrisy
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:25.760]  what about hammering her brian williams moment what do we do to reach out to her idiot supporters
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:31.120]  and get them out of their stupid trance i think that again that speech by trump was so perfectly
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:37.760]  crafted uh to do just that to turn people who you know out of anger whatever maybe ignorant
[01:26:37.760 --> 01:26:45.280]  supported bernie sanders uh you know in the primaries but they know what hillary is they know
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:51.600]  she is as corrupt as anybody who's ever run for president before and you know if they're going to
[01:26:51.600 --> 01:26:58.000]  vote at all i think a lot of them sure and the polls even show this that a lot of them will turn
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:02.720]  to trump that's why i say i think that we're talking we're looking at a major realignment here
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:09.280]  it will not hurt you know a lot of i got a lot of friends even relatives who work in government
[01:27:09.280 --> 01:27:16.240]  in washington you know under the dome and they're worried about you know losing congress i i think
[01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:21.360]  trump's gonna help every republican i agree let me ask the time we have left what happens if they
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:25.840]  steal the election from him i mean don't they know he's just a manifestation of rising nationalism
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:33.760]  populism and disgust with corruption well he's the he's the biggest fear that washington insiders
[01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:41.680]  of both parties have that again that certifies for me that we're we're on the right track here
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:46.880]  without i totally agree but what happens if they do steal the election from him well i mean if they
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:52.640]  steal the election from him it's all over i mean it's you know america's over quite honestly right
[01:27:52.640 --> 01:27:57.440]  i mean what what what can i do i agree that's not rhetoric we've really reached the point where it's
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:04.480]  do or die yeah oh no question about it in closing i want to ask you another question i love interviewing
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:12.400]  you on your own show what do you make of this i'm sure you've seen it this un military convoys
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:16.560]  all over the country now they're in virginia but of course we've seen them in many many other
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:21.920]  states over the years what what what do you make of this what what is going on that we don't know
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:26.960]  they've got them listen i i would just ask the question 15 years ago just like you did and and
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:32.960]  this all started maybe 20 and then they just got caches everywhere uh they're newer equipment they're
[01:28:32.960 --> 01:28:38.320]  not just you know old stuff they're refurbishing um it's bizarre and now all the news it's the
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:43.600]  un says this the un says that the un's bringing in refugees to texas the un's gonna watch our police
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:48.240]  departments i think they're getting ready for a total collapse and maybe states not being part
[01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:52.240]  of the union and i think they're getting ready for civil war two i'm not saying it's coming joseph
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:57.280]  but when they've got battle tanks being brought into the us being shipped in not out uh you know
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:01.920]  abram's tanks with un on the side something this way wicked comes we'd be idiots not to think so
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:07.440]  what do you think well absolutely i mean uh you have to ask yourself what are the alternative
[01:29:07.440 --> 01:29:13.760]  theories i can't think of any that's the that's the scary thing and you mentioned earlier the
[01:29:13.760 --> 01:29:20.320]  un role in uh you know the border and immigration from the southern border but it is the un that
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:26.640]  is also determining where the so-called syrian refugees go and they could activate them to
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:30.880]  start rioting and just look at that in europe and use that i mean these are brand new hunger games

[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:37.280]  to release illegals they've apprehended after crossing the border but as part of their release
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:41.920]  the legals are transported to the mcgallen bus station by border patrol agents who then buy them
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:46.960]  tickets to go wherever they want to go in the us so for example if the legals have relatives in
[01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:51.920]  boston that's where they get to go and taxpayers are paying for this illegal smuggling operation

[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:22.880]  you know i remember having dr. blalock on like 20 years ago top brain surgery with
[01:34:22.880 --> 01:34:26.880]  still a brain surgeon at the time before he retired and all these other experts on
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:34.080]  saying low fat diets are causing Alzheimer's and brain damage and heart disease and they had
[01:34:34.080 --> 01:34:40.880]  studies then i remember my dad saying it was trans fats artificial fats burnt fats that are bad
[01:34:41.760 --> 01:34:46.640]  oh but now it was in the new york times last week i have the article and the huffington post oh my

[01:34:54.080 --> 01:35:00.640]  give them a bullet surprise zuckerberg came out on friday in the new york times and it said zuckerberg
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:08.400]  covers up his webcam that was the headline you should too about 1920 years after i pioneered it
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:15.040]  and have been made fun of at least 18 years ago on bvc documentaries alex john ron senes why is
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:23.360]  your webcam covered you think say watching you do say out of the little polly wolf sinky got a little
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:30.720]  little bit of a problem well oh you think little green man one goes you tell and werewolves as well
[01:35:31.680 --> 01:35:36.880]  he wants to ask me you guys do you believe in werewolves because we're driving through this fog
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:40.640]  area and i go no i just said it looks like where werewolf would live man look at that like six foot
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:48.080]  the you're afraid of the you're afraid of the werewolves and i said uh yeah i'm real afraid of
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:55.040]  the werewolves she actually put it in his book and i'm afraid of werewolves i don't know it's just
[01:35:55.040 --> 01:36:00.320]  funny i actually like john ron so we should get him back up on the show sometime you're afraid of
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:04.960]  the werewolves alex he didn't really speak with that oliver twist cockney accent but it's fun to
[01:36:04.960 --> 01:36:12.720]  talk like that isn't it but there's something intellectual about almost the calm lazy eyes
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:19.440]  she's the of the left we don't want to arrest you unless you deny global warming
[01:36:21.600 --> 01:36:25.040]  oh no one really wants to arrest you oh actually we do now
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:32.320]  that's liberal there's a jail cell waiting for you it's like bill neither science guy
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:36.720]  marina goes you don't really want to arrest climate change and iris yes actually we do
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:40.560]  we're going to arrest you wow you're really dangerous
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:47.840]  but it's easy you see they think if they go with the establishment
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:52.640]  they end up getting power and you know what you wouldn't the past when the establishment
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:59.600]  still had viewers and still had supporters you don't anymore our reporters are going to be on
[01:36:59.600 --> 01:37:12.720]  the ground in mckellan at 130 so definitely look for that with jacari jackson and what camera person
[01:37:12.720 --> 01:37:19.360]  went with him michael's ever known what a great guy and adon salazar i'm glad adon was able to go
[01:37:22.160 --> 01:37:26.320]  i saw this story i stayed in my morning and i called uh buckley and do up and i said please
[01:37:26.320 --> 01:37:31.680]  whatever team is ready to go get them to the border and then i'm not even exhausted an hour
[01:37:31.680 --> 01:37:40.080]  and 37 minutes in the broadcast i just i've talked a lot about this when a certain constellation
[01:37:40.080 --> 01:37:45.200]  of news lines up and confirms 20 years of research worse than we thought
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:56.560]  it's kind of like calling in a family member to tell them that their mother or father died
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:01.920]  or that their son died and i've i've had to give people the news of family deaths
[01:38:02.480 --> 01:38:09.920]  multiple times it's not fun but at the same time this isn't like a family death what feels like that
[01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:19.760]  that because knowing about this is what's going to allow us to reverse it and to stop it
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:29.520]  but i i i've learned to psychoanalyze myself and realize that this news is also sensational
[01:38:29.520 --> 01:38:36.560]  also over the top all so incredible in how they roll out the most evil deception and and and just
[01:38:36.560 --> 01:38:44.960]  evil takeovers like it's no big deal that i could take one of these stories and talk for 10 hours
[01:38:44.960 --> 01:38:49.200]  about it you see me take a two-minute clip of obama and talk for 30 minutes just showing
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:53.920]  out each statement so total live from every angle and the problem is my brain looks at one of these
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:59.200]  watches one of these reports and just explodes with all the connections and angles and it's just
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.800]  trying to communicate this to the general public i don't know how you do it i mean
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:10.480]  i because it's so overwhelming so obvious so over the top i likened it last hour to the police
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:15.840]  finding a dead body let's say in a back of a guy's car
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:21.840]  stereotypical you know people say why do you say the back of a guy's car about a woman's car because
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:26.880]  men commit 98% of the murders that's why stereotypical just like muslims commit 98% of the terrorism
[01:39:26.880 --> 01:39:34.640]  it's a fact not a stereotype but top post money over they see blood and stuff in there and a weapon
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:39.120]  they they search the car probable cause reasonable suspicion then there's a dead body in the back get
[01:39:39.120 --> 01:39:44.320]  a warrant for the house find 20 something dead bodies in the basement there's videos you know
[01:39:44.320 --> 01:39:47.920]  the serial killer torturing the women to death and this has happened many times this is just one
[01:39:47.920 --> 01:39:53.840]  you know analogy and it's like i'm up here going and here's this dead body poured with lime and
[01:39:53.840 --> 01:39:58.800]  here's this skeleton we think he killed yours before people are going doesn't look like a body
[01:39:58.800 --> 01:40:04.800]  to me well here's the videos of him torturing him oh yeah right racist you know i mean it's it's like
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:11.600]  world government out in the open announcing world armies via the EU army we told people 20 years
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:20.320]  ago that was coming that's what announced yesterday you in armored vehicles of brand new construction
[01:40:20.320 --> 01:40:26.960]  being brought into the us and shipped everywhere all over the country i mean un abrams tanks
[01:40:26.960 --> 01:40:36.000]  un armored vehicles of the brand new construction just crazy town i've got
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:43.120]  fema contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395 food prices that's from
[01:40:43.120 --> 01:40:53.120]  vice which used to be a pretty good organization i mean now it's run by HBO there's a bunch of
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:58.160]  trendies i just wanted to come interview me the last few months a couple times and i just finally
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:00.800]  went you know i'd said yes at first and i just said you know what
[01:41:03.760 --> 01:41:10.160]  no it's like why not are you scared it's like no man i just got stuff to do i just
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:14.240]  i don't want to sit here with some training going you believe in black helicopters in a
[01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:20.240]  world government aliens eating brains huh and you hate gay people and i'm just like i just don't
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:26.000]  have time for children anymore i mean you may think it's funny they put fluoride in the water
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.640]  to brain damage people we even have the declassified documents the white house science are wrote a
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.880]  book about it you may think it's funny them teaching school kids not to have a fat diet
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:42.640]  so their brains don't grow it's the same thing as not having 50 percent of formula should be
[01:41:43.440 --> 01:41:48.720]  fat healthy clean fats it's not on average it's like 20 percent the rest is high fruit
[01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:54.320]  toast corn syrup that causes massive brain damage stupid and that's why you are stupid
[01:41:54.320 --> 01:42:00.480]  because you never got milk and i realize that there are a bunch of brain dead zombies that
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:05.600]  just have like five things they say you're a racist you're a homophobe you're a sexist and you don't
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:14.400]  dress ironically and i'm sorry i'm a real intellectual to the point i talk in my real
[01:42:14.400 --> 01:42:21.040]  texas accent and don't put on airs like you jackasses do and i don't even i just only want
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:25.920]  to cover this news it's just it's unbelievably horrible and it just confirms everything and
[01:42:25.920 --> 01:42:31.040]  what my guts been telling me and it's just like give me a break man do you up these really want
[01:42:31.040 --> 01:42:36.000]  global financial collapse do you understand it's by design do you know what a great depression
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:42.240]  will look like in this country when it's filled with people like you it's going to be hellish
[01:42:45.600 --> 01:42:49.840]  go watch the grapes of wrath and that was with super hard work in christian people
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:55.040]  and that's based on composites and stuff that really went on and it's horrible communist propaganda
[01:42:55.040 --> 01:43:01.520]  where they show up and the kami even looks like f dr and saves them and everything but but if you
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:11.520]  want to shoot the depression look like go watch that movie and just armies of dumb entitled
[01:43:11.520 --> 01:43:16.480]  socialist voters wanting free lunches and when they and when they're plight 10 times worse in a
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:21.360]  few years they'll never even remember or blame socialism they'll demand even more they'll
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:27.520]  demand communism there's no end and we'll have big mega corporations tax exempt behind armored
[01:43:27.520 --> 01:43:34.400]  fortress walls laughing at us as we're culturally devoured by drooling morons
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:46.960]  let me do this let me try to reset here for a moment and then i'm going to come back and cover
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:56.320]  uh the un military vehicles world net daily that ties in with uh vice fema contractor predicts
[01:43:56.320 --> 01:44:04.240]  social unrest in government report 395 food price hikes and it's not like i'm just going
[01:44:04.240 --> 01:44:16.480]  with this fema report we told you all this in 19 in 2007 and then we know the rest of the story
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:20.160]  how the globalists admit they're engineering this financial collapse but getting themselves
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:25.120]  positioned as the saviors with the many collapses around the world so they're fully in position for
[01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:30.240]  a total takeover when they really drop the hammer and we're desperately here trying to blame them
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:34.960]  for it because they admittedly are who are behind it because that's one of our only hopes to reverse
[01:44:34.960 --> 01:44:38.800]  it because if they think they're politically going to get the blame and if they think politically
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:44.400]  they're going to get brought down they will be forced to back off so i'm here trying to stop this
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:51.360]  for my own self-interest for my own family and i'm dealing with 50 percent of the public that
[01:44:51.360 --> 01:44:55.680]  literally doesn't know what planet they're on and can't find their butt with both hands
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:45:03.760]  and that's why i'm frustrated that's why i'm physically nauseous because during the break i
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:06.720]  was just trying to go over all this news get ready to come back and cover and i just i've
[01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:11.760]  actually felt vomitous and i just i can't do i cannot cover this okay i just can't do it
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:15.680]  more fine everything's fine everything's wonderful okay there's no world government
[01:45:15.680 --> 01:45:20.160]  fluoride's good for you the vaccines are good for you gmo's good for you radiation leaking's good for
[01:45:20.160 --> 01:45:29.680]  you the liberals have told us uh george mom beot the guardian sold just freakazoid craziness
[01:45:34.320 --> 01:45:37.920]  i mean i got stacks of articles where the un is shooing people taking over
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:43.120]  uh advising police departments involved setting up domestic spy grids they've got the military
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:47.360]  training for gun confiscation army times i mean they are really gearing up for some big stuff
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:52.800]  and i'm hoping it doesn't all go to hell in a handbasket i'm trying to stop it admitting
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:57.600]  we're in trouble stops it admitting hitlers planning to start world war two could have stopped it
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:05.040]  admitting our government's trying to start war with russia could stop it these elites always
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:09.600]  become megalomaniacs and think they're invincible and then they start wars they can't reverse but
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:14.160]  back then we didn't have atomic weapons or hydrogen bombs or god knows what else they've developed
[01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:20.400]  the pentagon leaked 10 years ago they've got antimatter bombs they're afraid to test them
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:25.920]  because they estimate it blow the entire planet up and turn it into a new asteroid belt
[01:46:25.920 --> 01:46:34.320]  maybe the entire solar system and then they'll have some joke article in some
[01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:38.560]  white house funded idiot group making fun of me for that statement when it was in the
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:43.360]  it was in the mit quarterly and it was in the san francisco chronicle
[01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:51.600]  but you just joke about it like chimeras i told you about 20 years ago now they admit
[01:46:51.600 --> 01:46:58.000]  human animal splices and again i'm not up here on some freaking high horse man
[01:46:58.000 --> 01:47:01.440]  this stuff is all battle plan for you and your family
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.760]  i read this report right here i'm gonna come back and cover this but fema contractor predicts
[01:47:07.760 --> 01:47:16.160]  social unrest caused by 395 food price spikes the simulation titled food chain reaction was
[01:47:16.160 --> 01:47:22.400]  desktop game exercise involving the participation of 65 officials u.s europe africa india brazil
[01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:26.960]  and key multinational and intergovernmental institutions and it goes on to basically say
[01:47:26.960 --> 01:47:30.800]  there's no way to stop it with the population and what's happened with food and the globalists
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:34.480]  have done all this stuff to shut down food production that's the post industrial world
[01:47:34.480 --> 01:47:42.000]  they've set up that state department memorandum 200 from henry kissinger remember 1979
[01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:55.040]  it was declassified in 79 it was from 1977 you can pull it up it's declassified cia
[01:47:56.160 --> 01:47:59.760]  where he said the goal is to turn the food off and starve the third world and finally the west
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:02.800]  he writes books calling military dumb animals
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:12.880]  i mean this is serious this is serious serious they've got a plan and boy i see
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:16.320]  them getting lined up and i don't want to i don't want to see it come through by the way this time
[01:48:16.320 --> 01:48:20.960]  my brain works oh we still we sell the highest quality storeable foods the last 25 years the
[01:48:20.960 --> 01:48:25.760]  lowest price out there at m4store.com it's m4 select it's the full spectrum of my patriot supply
[01:48:25.760 --> 01:48:29.280]  we sell it the same stuff right next to it just a little bit higher price already a great deal
[01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:32.800]  and i think boy we're gonna have a great depression it's probably inevitable now
[01:48:32.800 --> 01:48:35.920]  i need to raise more money to fund this operation through the depression how am i
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:40.000]  going to do this plus i need to get more storeable food at the office and for my family
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:44.000]  plus everybody needs to get this for themselves so i'm going to show people this report and hope
[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:48.960]  it gets them to buy food the media would spend that and say opportunistically he uses a femur report
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:54.800]  to get people to get food well uh yeah the ship sink and get to a life raft i hope you
[01:48:54.800 --> 01:48:58.400]  don't have to use it i hope we're wrong we're trying to stop it but if you don't go to m4
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:04.960]  wars select.com m4store.com and get the high quality storeable food you are insane if you don't get
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:08.720]  more guns and ammunition if you don't learn how to use guns if you haven't learned how to use them
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:13.280]  if you don't have neighbors and friends you trust and maybe a neighbor who's got a farm 50 miles
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:19.440]  outside town believe me if stuff collapses it could get really bad seven million people
[01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:25.760]  multiple university studies look it up typing seven million people starved during the great
[01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:33.360]  depression they starved or died of illnesses resulting from malnutrition that's seven million
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:40.400]  we were 90 agrarian we were 90 rural and more than half those people were self-sufficient
[01:49:41.280 --> 01:49:46.880]  so more than half the country was self-sufficient and seven million starved to death seven million
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:57.840]  seven million plus now you think about that long and hard because today we are what is it 89 percent
[01:49:57.840 --> 01:50:05.840]  urban 11 to 10 depending on which federal study rural and less than half of those people five
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:13.440]  percent or less are self-sufficient my god we've gone from 55 percent self-sufficient to less than
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:20.640]  five percent self-sufficient and we are an immoral degenerate satanic nation that sells baby parts
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:25.600]  and keeps them alive to harvest them we don't even care and you imagine these drooling slobs
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:29.520]  running around acting trendy that are calling for our arrest and calling for the murder of gun owners
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:34.080]  just cropping and begging at the feet of the globalist i mean they'll they'll be the first
[01:50:34.080 --> 01:50:40.880]  people the globalists shut down but that's after they have a full takeover just drooling masses
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:46.720]  of nobodies given authoritarian control they're coming you can really see this whole global
[01:50:47.280 --> 01:50:51.440]  system that'll make world war two look like nothing they're trying to set up and everyone's

[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:39.360]  to hear from you about what you think about all these u.n vehicles around the united states
[01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:46.720]  what you think of fema government reports because that's actually what this is a report
[01:54:46.720 --> 01:54:51.360]  conducted with multinational governments and our own government with the occupational
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:57.600]  10 state dictatorship that is fema see when we come in with intros that say from deep behind

[01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:08.640]  make those radical statements because it's so radical what the globalists have done people
[01:55:08.640 --> 01:55:15.360]  are basically caught blindside by it they're dumbfounded because it just sounds so outrageous
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:20.400]  multinationals we didn't vote to enter or running things and the u.n's making our laws and multinational
[01:55:20.400 --> 01:55:25.920]  banks or tax exempt and have diplomatic immunity and i mean that's all on record and they're now
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:29.520]  coming in and saying you're not going to use the word mother and father you're not going to have any
[01:55:29.520 --> 01:55:34.400]  real state authority we're not going to let you have guns it's a u.n treaty the u.n says we're
[01:55:34.400 --> 01:55:44.160]  going to take more refugees from latin america and that's an abc news the u.n says well they're
[01:55:44.160 --> 01:55:49.200]  illegal but the u.n says so obama's allowed to do it doesn't matter what the supreme court says
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:56:01.280]  the globalist the rockefellers set up the u.n in 1945 to set up world government go read the
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:09.200]  book written by day the rockefeller go read the charter oh but all the movie stars and the and the

[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:18.080]  so people go well the u.n must be this wonderful thing the u.n is hated all over the world
[01:56:18.080 --> 01:56:24.400]  it runs sex slavery rings everywhere look it up it runs drugs it is the legion of death
[01:56:27.760 --> 01:56:34.160]  and now they want to set up an eu army with the united nations to quote police the nations
[01:56:34.160 --> 01:56:41.840]  so they can't leave they actually say that and it's just not even news oh they're going to set up a
[01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:49.040]  domestic army to arrest people that criticize the open borders isn't that great and i've got stacks
[01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:54.000]  of news in the united states at airports where muslims are attacking christians and freaking out
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:59.360]  or where muslims are attacking gays they see that's in the news today or where a woman goes
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:04.480]  into a catholic church and desecrates mary a muslim woman just flips out these people kill
[01:57:04.480 --> 01:57:08.960]  each other in their own countries they just police each other get everybody's faces run around
[01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:15.040]  foaming at the mouth and now in germany they're having to say october fest has to be behind closed
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:20.400]  doors or you have to go through a checkpoint because the muslims are coming in and attacking people
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:30.880]  if they catch you in more than 11 muslim nations kissing another man if you're a man or a woman
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:40.000]  of your woman they kill you if they rape your wife or daughter and she it's her fault and they kill her
[01:57:42.960 --> 01:57:46.560]  this is who our quote elite are bringing in and then meanwhile
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:54.720]  i'm going to shoot a special report on this for the united nations but i'm going to do it
[01:57:54.720 --> 01:58:00.400]  but and i'm going to cover it some with pechenik and and and others that are coming up pechenik

[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:33.280]  a global crisis that would then bring in a greater eu dictatorship but instead it's causing nation states
[01:58:33.280 --> 01:58:37.440]  to pull out because the liberty movement warned folks so the point is the elite aren't the only

[02:00:22.320 --> 02:00:43.200]  i'll say this the united states is sitting in a better position than many nations
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:48.480]  but everything obama is doing and the globalist are doing is trying to undermine the country
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:53.680]  and i'm going to ask dr pacenic this if the elite are in control of europe the united states
[02:00:54.960 --> 02:01:00.080]  they're successfully undermining russia and china but they're successfully undermining
[02:01:00.080 --> 02:01:05.360]  the american people as well and the family and trying to sabotage our own military
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:11.760]  what is going on here and dr steve pacenic of steve pacenic dot com
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:15.280]  he of course co-wrote books with tom clancy he was involved in all sorts of clandestine
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:21.280]  operations the head of psychological warfare for the state department you couldn't get a more
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:25.680]  informed patriotic insider on that a member of the council on farm relations until he resigned
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:33.200]  one of the first prominent people to expose 911 as an inside job in early 2002 he exposed the whole
[02:01:33.200 --> 02:01:37.360]  bin laden hoax accurately uh this is a short segment long segment coming up the doc you heard
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:42.640]  my question i see a schizophrenic policies and i get the thing of funding all sides or whatever
[02:01:42.640 --> 02:01:46.720]  but it seems to me beyond that and i know there's lots of different factions but why why does our
[02:01:46.720 --> 02:01:50.480]  government do a lot of things that actually help american interests but then other things that
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:56.480]  actually undermine our interest is that just different power structures well it is uh alex
[02:01:56.480 --> 02:02:05.040]  as usual our government is very very self-destructive in part because it has become so large that one
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:11.600]  part literally does not know what the other part for example the cia was supplying ammunition and
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:17.920]  guns to the so-called rebels who were fighting by char aside while the military was training others
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:24.240]  who were pro aside i mean it is so confusing and that's why one of the reasons we need a president
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:30.320]  who's been vetted out completely not just somebody who the cia wanted up there we need a president
[02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:38.080]  who understands what it is we're doing where we're going and has a a coterie of experienced people
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:44.240]  who have been in crises before now one of the greatest problems in this brexit is the fact
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:50.640]  that our government didn't know at all that this was going to happen not only was it a binary decision
[02:02:50.640 --> 02:02:57.920]  i'd eat either england left or didn't leave the country was so convinced and so self delusional
[02:02:57.920 --> 02:03:04.800]  as was obama and carrie that they really didn't map out what would happen in case this was a
[02:03:04.800 --> 02:03:11.360]  situation and in fact it caught it caught them completely flat footed and carrie admitted it
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:17.120]  and obama had to admit it in fact obama went a week before the brexit in order to make sure
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:22.160]  that all the people around him i eat the wall street bankers were there to convince britain
[02:03:22.160 --> 02:03:27.760]  that they mean that they rest in the e u and so they threatened to hold them hostage their bluff
[02:03:27.760 --> 02:03:33.840]  got called now things are disintegrating uh they're in a lot of trouble well that's correct the problem
[02:03:33.840 --> 02:03:40.640]  the good news is that god loves drunks and united states no matter what happens to us and no matter
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:47.040]  how incompetent our government is and it's exceedingly incompetent for reasons that we can go into
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:52.320]  later on possibly probably because of the entrepreneurial nature of our people and because
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:59.520]  we're so large and we're blessed by two oceans it really doesn't affect us in a in a in reality
[02:03:59.520 --> 02:04:06.080]  actually if people are concerned what i would say to them is to buy stocks that give a dividend and
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:11.680]  are you know very secure because basically what you're doing is you're going along with the dollar
[02:04:11.680 --> 02:04:17.600]  going along with the dollar means that america can bet on the dollar being the supreme currency
[02:04:17.600 --> 02:04:24.560]  and i want to go back to historical precedents where we had brilliant men during the war world
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:31.760]  war two not only patin eisenhower but we had a gentleman named morgan for a german jew who figured
[02:04:31.760 --> 02:04:39.520]  out very quickly in december of 1944 that in order for america to be a really superpower we had to
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:44.800]  denominate all current dot up dot this is powerful only to start over because this is so important
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:49.280]  about brexit okay uh where you're coming from where we're going because i remember you on
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:55.680]  five years ago saying europe is going to disintegrate you watch and then basically breaking this down
[02:04:55.680 --> 02:05:01.840]  so let's talk about this arrogance and what that signifies both g lp nominee donald trump
[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:06.400]  and leftist investor george soros have predicted the complete downfall to european union despite
[02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:10.800]  trump being a nationalist and sorosa globalist the two billionaires both independently declared
[02:05:10.800 --> 02:05:15.040]  that they believe a domino effect has been started by britain's decision to leave the u and the process
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:20.480]  will be difficult for anyone to stop as reported by steve watson soros said quote now the catastrophic
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:25.200]  scenario that many feared has materialized making the disintegration of the e u practically irreversible
[02:05:25.200 --> 02:05:29.200]  trump also predicted a complete breakup of the e u and also warned that the continent would be
[02:05:29.200 --> 02:05:33.760]  completely unrecognizable within 10 years if strict immigration controls are not enacted
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:38.240]  trump told reporters quote the people have spoken i think the e u is going to break up i think the
[02:05:38.240 --> 02:05:42.000]  e you might break up before anyone thinks in terms of scotland trump is referring to the
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:46.960]  resistance scottish politicians are still giving brexit he continued stating that i really think
[02:05:46.960 --> 02:05:51.200]  that without the immigration issue the e u wouldn't have had a chance of breaking up the people are
[02:05:51.200 --> 02:05:55.760]  fed up whether it's here or in other countries you watch other countries will follow for more news

[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:37.440]  texas command center it's alex jones and we talk about a command center we are under fema
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:42.480]  we are under this whole corporate global model and the people of europe have discovered that
[02:08:42.480 --> 02:08:47.840]  eight nations want to leave the euro it's dictatorial uh we have the brexit that obama and others
[02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:53.760]  and hillary you know said oh you know they'll never leave uh to me it seems like a big defeat for
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:09:00.560]  globalism and it seems like they were caught flat-footed but dr steve pacinic uh for remember
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:04.880]  the council and farm relations best-selling author one of the founders of general boykin and others
[02:09:04.880 --> 02:09:09.680]  of delta force that's on record the guy that ran the camp david accords i mean his pedigree is just
[02:09:09.680 --> 02:09:14.560]  that amazing you can just google his name and you know there he can't talk about too much the
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:18.160]  justice department will come call him in the court again like happens when he comes on the show
[02:09:18.160 --> 02:09:22.800]  routinely now because of how secretive you know all this stuff is he's been involved in overthrowing
[02:09:22.800 --> 02:09:27.280]  countries stopping the overthrow of countries i mean that's on record so he's the real deal
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:33.120]  with a lot of talkers out there and i tell you he really predicted four years ago after bengazi
[02:09:33.120 --> 02:09:37.760]  what would happen we're going to go in we're going to block these saudi guys other people are trying
[02:09:37.760 --> 02:09:42.320]  to double crosses we're going to stop them that all came out is what happened i got other sources
[02:09:42.320 --> 02:09:46.400]  that are public others that aren't the concurred uh and so i'm just letting you know he gives us
[02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:52.800]  really good intelligence over and over and over and over again and so what does this
[02:09:52.800 --> 02:09:56.560]  british exit mean sure there's going to be synonymous and try to keep folks in it i'm not
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:10:01.440]  against some union if it's if it's democratic and empowers people and it's just economic
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:06.080]  but when it is arresting people that criticize open borders when it's the talitarian and wants to
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:11.760]  arrest global warming deniers like the democratic party platform officially says today uh then we
[02:10:11.760 --> 02:10:17.520]  know this is an authoritarian movement by the big banks through the democrats and the republicans
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:21.600]  through the labor through the tori and this is really an awakening moment but but talking to
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:26.160]  pechenik if he just joined us he started getting into the fact that it shows the ineptitude the
[02:10:26.160 --> 02:10:32.080]  arrogance the flat footedness and i agree look at the euro bureaucracy that's unelected but set up
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:36.960]  from the start to rule it because it started as a coal and steel collective i mean started out as a
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:42.480]  good technocracy folks it didn't just become one they're saying we're just going to have an
[02:10:42.480 --> 02:10:46.880]  EU army and it's going to take over your militaries we're going to start commanding them the bureaucracy
[02:10:46.880 --> 02:10:51.040]  is going to put out a report we're going to bring in new commanders over your commanders folks that
[02:10:51.040 --> 02:10:57.760]  is literal occupation that is like hitler coming in and putting his french generals in over the
[02:10:57.760 --> 02:11:03.360]  french the vici i mean i harp on that because it's what's happening this is so crazy i can't even
[02:11:03.360 --> 02:11:08.880]  believe it and globalist policies trying to jack up food prices worldwide trying to bring in a crisis
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:13.680]  where these guys consolidate control but what if they bring in a crisis so big it brings them down
[02:11:14.480 --> 02:11:18.880]  by the way i'm not sure licking my lips want to see the whole system crash i want these evil
[02:11:18.880 --> 02:11:26.720]  globalist top to stop wrecking things and basing things on conquest and collapse instead of renaissance
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:33.200]  so i'm not looking for some civil war i'm not looking to uh you know just see herman von rumpi
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:39.200]  and merkel's head on a platter i just realized these people aren't as smart as napoleon or hitler
[02:11:39.200 --> 02:11:44.400]  they were bad guys by the way weren't as smart as people before them and they just think they're
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:48.800]  invincible because they're in control and it gets more and more dangerous so to cover the
[02:11:48.800 --> 02:11:53.600]  waterfront and one of the time we have is dr steve pacenic steve pacenic dot com let's walk
[02:11:53.600 --> 02:11:58.400]  let's walk through this history where we are and then i want to ask you about the global economic
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:03.440]  system because we got femur reports and others saying worldwide food crises you name it is that
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:08.960]  hyper what's going on dr pacenic thanks for joining us start back over all right uh i think it's
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:15.680]  important for the audience to understand we americans uh in in 1944 because of the incredible
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:22.320]  quality of leaders that we had at that point under fdr morgan's law and others in the treasury
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:27.120]  developed what was called the breton wood conference which basically stated very clearly
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:34.080]  that for the next half a century to a century we will have the dollar denominated as the currency
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:40.800]  of the world that became so ingrained that anybody who has a chance to go to new hampshire
[02:12:40.800 --> 02:12:45.760]  mount washington should see that little room which that determined the outcome of american
[02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:51.360]  superpower it was not only our army it was the brilliance of men who could foresee what would
[02:12:51.360 --> 02:12:57.680]  happen to our country now taking that forward the french came in after world war two although they
[02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:03.440]  were defeated my father's in the french army in the first order he got was retreat and unfortunately
[02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:10.640]  2.2 million men retreated the reality is that france after world war two said to the americans
[02:13:10.640 --> 02:13:16.000]  that we have to co-op the rise of germany because france had been defeated twice by the germans
[02:13:16.000 --> 02:13:22.240]  in world war one and two so they came together on the theoretical notion which was total nonsense
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:29.760]  to co-op the germans by creating a united states of europe that in turn had no legitimacy it had
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:36.480]  no concrete basis and as alex told you it basically was a bunch of bureaucrats ironically put in the
[02:13:36.480 --> 02:13:42.960]  worst country of all which was not really a country belgium at the site where napoleon was defeated
[02:13:42.960 --> 02:13:50.480]  in the 1815 only five days before the brexit so in a way history recapitulates itself when england
[02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:57.440]  and germany defeated france what this is is the end of globalization for five to ten years i've been
[02:13:57.440 --> 02:14:03.680]  saying that the so-called notion of globalization is artificial and not real because what was
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:10.080]  happening is the big banks on wall street were in fact putting the tentacles out to every country
[02:14:10.080 --> 02:14:15.520]  however because they're basically so arrogant and inept like our government and you saw this
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:22.560]  in 2008 they quickly ran with obama to britain and before britain went on the brexit they pleaded
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:27.840]  these were the major banks not the regional and local banks they're very safe so americans should
[02:14:27.840 --> 02:14:34.080]  understand your local regional banks are fine because of the reserve currencies that were mandated
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:41.120]  after 2008 what happened is the goldman sacks the morgan stanley's the big unfortunate banks and the
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:48.480]  corrupt ones could now had to put in their own uh tentacles into the different countries as opposed
[02:14:48.480 --> 02:14:55.040]  to going through britain our country did not in any way anticipate that this was happening despite
[02:14:55.040 --> 02:15:01.520]  the fact that i would write repeatedly both in cyber command cyber warfare in the net force series
[02:15:01.520 --> 02:15:08.800]  by tom clancy i wrote about it in op center when spain broke out and barcelona broke away from spain
[02:15:08.800 --> 02:15:14.480]  i kept saying it for five years on the alex jones show that this was the beginning of the end of
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:21.280]  europe because europe is an artificial construct that has no basis for solidity it's different
[02:15:21.280 --> 02:15:29.040]  national characters 28 to 29 with one currency the difference is the united states has one currency
[02:15:29.040 --> 02:15:35.920]  for 52 states and we're unified because it's a republic there may be attempts at a secession
[02:15:35.920 --> 02:15:42.720]  like texas or others but i don't think it will be successful as opposed to devolution of power
[02:15:42.720 --> 02:15:48.160]  so what i've really been talking about and alex really pointed this out over the years is not
[02:15:48.160 --> 02:15:54.080]  that the globalists were increasing is that we have a devolution of power going on all over the
[02:15:54.080 --> 02:16:00.160]  world including the chinese who have to centralize power but are fighting their own corruption in
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:06.160]  the local areas the one is going down china will not do well in this they will try to attempt to
[02:16:06.160 --> 02:16:12.160]  make the one a currency that's an alternate to the american currency of the british pound
[02:16:12.160 --> 02:16:18.240]  that will not happen the pound will still remain strong the euro will fall repeatedly because
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:25.280]  france has a very low growth rate and it had before france even attempted to stop the brexit it
[02:16:25.280 --> 02:16:30.880]  already had riots what's the calculus on bringing in all the refugees uh five million from the
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:34.640]  middle east it's gotta be hundreds of thousands of non-millions here they're covering it up
[02:16:34.640 --> 02:16:40.720]  what is the whole point of bringing in people unskilled 22 that have tb i mean this sounds
[02:16:40.720 --> 02:16:45.440]  i mean this sounds like treason the way i looked at it and the way i said it on your show many
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:52.560]  years ago was that this was putin's revenge on the takedown of the soviet union i i when i listened
[02:16:52.560 --> 02:16:58.720]  to putin many years ago he's very clever man he said imagine what countries are like when you
[02:16:58.720 --> 02:17:04.480]  liberate 20 million people may have no country i.e addressing me and others who involved in the
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:11.520]  takedown the soviet union and i realized that he would in fact get into the syrian war to create
[02:17:11.520 --> 02:17:18.960]  this conflagration support by sarah side with iran and then allow all of these young men to transfer
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:24.640]  over into turkish and and of course he came out yesterday uh putin and said this this this reminds
[02:17:24.640 --> 02:17:30.080]  him of the fall of the soviet union oh i didn't know that you see i had anticipated it and i warned
[02:17:30.080 --> 02:17:36.000]  our people but again they didn't listen again our people you know this is the point why you are
[02:17:36.000 --> 02:17:42.000]  important and why the american public has done to listen to you we've talked about this for years
[02:17:42.000 --> 02:17:47.360]  beforehand i knew our our government was not qualified to answer this i knew our government
[02:17:47.360 --> 02:17:54.640]  was not even capable of anticipating any of these problems and gaming them out unlike the nixon
[02:17:54.640 --> 02:18:00.080]  administration whatever you could say for nixon right or wrong the man was brilliant he knew exactly
[02:18:00.080 --> 02:18:06.640]  how to game out the chinese how to game out the soviet even under the baker administration we knew
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:12.240]  how to game out the soviet union under rake and our elites don't game anybody they just get bought
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:16.880]  off for almost nothing i mean they give up all the power of sovereignty for like a few million
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:22.880]  dollars a piece i mean it's just crazy well in effect alex there is no more sovereignty and
[02:18:22.880 --> 02:18:30.640]  they have no power what you saw obama doing was to really again uh basically self-destruct he
[02:18:30.640 --> 02:18:36.640]  self-destruct with osama ben laden nonsense which didn't exist the shooting with sandy hook a false
[02:18:36.640 --> 02:18:42.880]  flag with another false flag so he will be known as the sociopath that he is i said it from the day
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:51.200]  he came in he was a cia recruit a complete sociopath whose only advantage was hey we know current
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:56.240]  at the agents that have investigated sandy hook and think it's a hoax i mean it's incredible
[02:18:56.240 --> 02:19:00.560]  i'm not going to get into it not only that the question is what do we do when we know
[02:19:00.560 --> 02:19:07.120]  that our government is tyrannical and is is capable of killing us and shooting us it's not
[02:19:07.120 --> 02:19:12.960]  just fema but the question is really when will we protest and how will that protest but isn't
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:18.400]  it clear that it's a criminal element inside our government well the government is criminal i mean
[02:19:18.400 --> 02:19:25.680]  how do you allow our government to attack the twin towers when you have the cia the dia the
[02:19:25.680 --> 02:19:31.120]  military intelligence you have the soldiers you have the police you have homeland security
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:37.520]  you have the wasp train euler who says oh no we didn't know about it and the fbi the most
[02:19:38.080 --> 02:19:46.000]  self-aggrandized organization other than the cia repeatedly making mistakes and and and and
[02:19:46.000 --> 02:19:51.440]  confusing the issue and really getting part of the collusion of a tough hitting and hurting and
[02:19:51.440 --> 02:19:54.720]  then why are they allowing the islamic invasion just so they can have more terror attacks and
[02:19:54.720 --> 02:19:58.720]  get more funding i'm going to ask you that when we come back or see picenics our guest analyzing

[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:23.600]  a reporter sound the valley where they're admittedly bringing in illegal aliens and putting them on
[02:24:23.600 --> 02:24:27.600]  buses now we broke that two years ago nobody else covered it and that's a big deal it shows the
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:33.120]  lawlessness but now it's on abc news so we thought we'd go back down there and show folks so jacari
[02:24:33.120 --> 02:24:37.440]  jackson the non-salem star and others joining us caught ran handed more patrol paying to ship
[02:24:37.440 --> 02:24:41.600]  illegals deep in the united states this is the lawlessness look at the sunday express headline
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:47.440]  european superstate to be unveiled e u and we told you this last week e u nations to be
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:52.800]  quote morphed into one post brexit so you don't have an excuse to leave now we'll fix that problem
[02:24:53.520 --> 02:24:59.040]  so this shows the incredible totalitarian nature and obviously this will just accelerate people
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:04.640]  wanting to leave even more uh but what is it about tyrants dr patrick they just don't get it
[02:25:04.640 --> 02:25:09.680]  they just it's it's like you know katalonia or katalon one of the only prosperous areas in
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:14.960]  spain its own culture 90 something percent of people voted to leave madrid said you can't they
[02:25:14.960 --> 02:25:19.760]  just said we'll do whatever you want i mean how do you stop 90 you can't control 90 and make them
[02:25:19.760 --> 02:25:28.160]  do what you want you can only kill them yeah the reason i knew katalonia would break away from
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:35.200]  madrid number one madrid is an artificial construct created by uh frances the second a french king
[02:25:35.200 --> 02:25:40.640]  there is no spain it's really valencia and basque barcelona as you know and i wrote about
[02:25:40.640 --> 02:25:47.200]  katalon breaking away the problem in spain will be that it had a civil war during the 30s millions
[02:25:47.200 --> 02:25:52.560]  died and it could have another civil war because the katalons are not spanish they will fight if
[02:25:52.560 --> 02:25:58.560]  they have to and madrid doesn't have a national force that can really counteract it what happens
[02:25:58.560 --> 02:26:04.560]  to tyrants is they see the you know power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:10.000]  but in that premise what people don't realize it's the beginning of the end of the tyrant
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:15.920]  the minute the tyrant exercises that kind of absolute power like obama is doing like those
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:21.840]  henchmen around him then it begins it becomes the end of their dynasty and then the end of their
[02:26:21.840 --> 02:26:28.160]  tenure what happens putin understands very well in the history of the romanoffs and the zars and
[02:26:28.160 --> 02:26:34.880]  Stalin the only way the tyrants leave is through assassination or death there is no other way in
[02:26:34.880 --> 02:26:40.880]  the united states we either assassinate our presidents which we've done with lbj we had
[02:26:40.880 --> 02:26:48.400]  you know shootings on which we did with jfk and we warned lbj not to continue and we told reagan
[02:26:48.400 --> 02:26:54.480]  that he has a problem and then we went on and so forth things just don't happen by chance or accident
[02:26:55.040 --> 02:27:00.880]  now we have a corrupt government we have an inept government that's worse because corruption may be
[02:27:00.880 --> 02:27:06.640]  needed in order to get systems going it's just a degree of corruption but when you have incompetence
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:13.040]  to the top susan rise cement the power the ben rodes all those people who really have no idea what
[02:27:13.040 --> 02:27:17.600]  they're doing and they stood in one of those think tanks it's time to get rid of all of them
[02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:24.160]  the trump you know attempt to come into the presidency is far more important than people
[02:27:24.160 --> 02:27:30.400]  realize not only because he said the system is rigged but he clearly articulated in words what
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:35.600]  you have been doing what i have been doing in many millions of others have said we're disgusted
[02:27:35.600 --> 02:27:42.000]  with the rig system nevertheless the rig system continues if hillary comes in my suspicion is
[02:27:42.000 --> 02:27:48.400]  there will be violence i you know i can't uh proffer it but they know the people are listening
[02:27:48.400 --> 02:27:54.160]  to me that they were more than effective in handing me subpoenas or when i they felt i was out of
[02:27:54.160 --> 02:28:00.320]  control they have they sent cello helicopters above my house to give me a warning now i don't
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:05.920]  have a problem fighting against my nation for my nation and our republic because i had to fight
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:12.800]  overseas but i call on our military to wake up i call on our generals to stop worrying about their
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:18.640]  pensions and their liability right now we have more generals who aren't pension than active duty
[02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:25.360]  military officers and that's a crime and instead we don't have an army that really is loyal to the
[02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:31.120]  republic what the republic did and obama did with the very shrewd and clever element they create
[02:28:31.120 --> 02:28:37.280]  strategic tension all over the world so that our military is deployed not because they have to fight
[02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:44.480]  for the republic but it's a way of getting rid of our military domestically so we're in 786 bases
[02:28:44.480 --> 02:28:50.000]  then you asked why are these false flags occurring you hit it on the head repeatedly when you said
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:56.160]  it was to round up our ammunition and guns but there's a more serious reason and a more perfidious
[02:28:56.160 --> 02:29:01.200]  reason that i have maintained throughout and that is what i wrote in the state of emergency
[02:29:01.760 --> 02:29:08.240]  our government can no longer justify its existence without creating strategic tension within our
[02:29:08.240 --> 02:29:15.040]  country in other words the federal government sui generis has no legitimacy it has to create
[02:29:15.040 --> 02:29:20.400]  strategic tension so that it can mandate its federal truth sure it has to make itself the hero
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:24.080]  and and violate jurisdictions if you can do like four more minutes on the other side i want to ask
[02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:30.080]  you don't as a pop psychiatrist but also a medical doctor uh harvard and mit trained i want to ask you
[02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:35.200]  just briefly about a miracle about an obama about i mean who these people are why they're so dishonorable
[02:29:35.200 --> 02:29:39.920]  why well i mean i mean the most scummy as people get powers to stay right there dr potenik i'm
[02:29:39.920 --> 02:29:45.440]  alex jones and then jacari jackson don salazar and other reporters in the valley where the un is
[02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:52.080]  ordering and directing unnamed migrants to just be let in we're on the march the empires on the run
[02:29:52.960 --> 02:30:02.000]  alex jones and the gcn radio network oh yeah no problem finally the mainstream media is reporting
[02:30:02.000 --> 02:30:06.480]  on what we broke two years ago the us customs and border patrol under pressure from the obama
[02:30:06.480 --> 02:30:10.320]  administration is purchasing bus tickets for illegals to ship them deeper into the country at
[02:30:10.320 --> 02:30:15.120]  taxpayers expense local news station car gv is now covering how the mcgallin texas bus station is
[02:30:15.120 --> 02:30:19.680]  used as a transit hub for illegals obama is bringing into the country which info wars.com
[02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:25.040]  exclusively broke in 2014 when no one else dared to report on it k r gv revealed that over a hundred
[02:30:25.040 --> 02:30:30.800]  legals a day are being dropped off at the mcgallin station and in 2014 info wars reported on how the
[02:30:30.800 --> 02:30:34.560]  obama administration was ordering the border patrol to release illegals they've apprehended
[02:30:34.560 --> 02:30:39.120]  after crossing the border but as part of their release the legals are transported to the mcgallin
[02:30:39.120 --> 02:30:44.080]  bus station by border patrol agents who then buy them tickets to go wherever they want to go in the
[02:30:44.080 --> 02:30:49.280]  us so for example if the legals have relatives in boston that's where they get to go and taxpayers
[02:30:49.280 --> 02:30:54.160]  are paying for this illegal smuggling operation to find out more about obama's lawlessness visit

[02:33:40.800 --> 02:33:46.080]  where the un's running the illegal alien invasion they're actually selling news the un advised us
[02:33:46.080 --> 02:33:50.240]  the un comes in they're illegal and then we just put them on buses and ship them wherever they want
[02:33:50.240 --> 02:33:58.160]  but when i came in from islamaharas took my children fishing for five six days uh they interrogated
[02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:02.320]  every one of them and asked them what'd you buy what'd you do where'd you go and the guy knew full
[02:34:02.320 --> 02:34:07.600]  well who i was had a big x on my uh little you know computer print out when i went through that first
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:14.000]  and as it does every time and i got to be interrogated uh but if i didn't wear a burqa over
[02:34:14.000 --> 02:34:18.960]  my head there wouldn't be any problem and again i'm not here to start some war with the muslims
[02:34:18.960 --> 02:34:24.080]  but if i could point out they've got rights i don't have and this whole thing security theater
[02:34:24.080 --> 02:34:28.720]  maybe i could get my freedoms back because all i see with this police state is domesticating me
[02:34:28.720 --> 02:34:33.680]  that i have no rights i have no freedoms and i need to worship some all powerful centralized
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:38.000]  government and that's why i'm trying to get people self-sufficient i'm trying to get folks
[02:34:38.000 --> 02:34:42.800]  to take action uh and get involved in their communities to take back our nation by being
[02:34:42.800 --> 02:34:46.880]  productive by being honorable now we're going to go to our reporters here in a few minutes but dr
[02:34:46.880 --> 02:34:52.320]  pacinic again you're not just a pop psychologist you're not just a psychiatrist uh you know harvard
[02:34:52.320 --> 02:34:56.720]  trained mit and you know politics you name it i'm gonna go over your whole pedigree for listeners
[02:34:56.720 --> 02:35:01.760]  but it's very extensive obviously and they can't stand the fact you come on the show i've been
[02:35:01.760 --> 02:35:05.120]  visited by the government about it you've been visited and then people say well why don't you
[02:35:05.120 --> 02:35:09.200]  tell us all about it well you did put the subpoena online and talk about it and go through it all i
[02:35:09.200 --> 02:35:13.920]  just i just sit there and just you know leave it where it's at and and just laugh at people
[02:35:13.920 --> 02:35:18.080]  basically because all i'm doing is basic good stuff i'm a good guy and and you know trying to
[02:35:18.080 --> 02:35:22.720]  save this country because i live here my kids live here and you know my ancestors lived here and i
[02:35:22.720 --> 02:35:27.360]  just really you know don't have it out for the average person i just i just want to have a free
[02:35:27.360 --> 02:35:33.360]  nation uh but but look at the psychology of the sycophants the obamas the hillaries uh and others
[02:35:33.360 --> 02:35:37.520]  i mean they just want to mount america's head on the wall they really are after the bitter
[02:35:37.520 --> 02:35:44.480]  clingers they really hate people that are independent of any race color or creed i mean they they
[02:35:44.480 --> 02:35:51.680]  really do want to physically dominate what was americana even though that's what ends up generating
[02:35:51.680 --> 02:35:56.800]  the power of the nation that these parasites basically control and and and siphon off of and
[02:35:56.800 --> 02:36:01.680]  ride to global control so i don't understand the schizophrenic behavior or the self-destructive
[02:36:01.680 --> 02:36:06.320]  behavior of them just it's seeming like they're out to get us i mean they even say they are when
[02:36:06.320 --> 02:36:11.920]  their internal memos come out a is that correct to just a few minutes on the psychology of these
[02:36:11.920 --> 02:36:16.320]  people as somebody that wrote the book on state department psychological operations who helped
[02:36:16.320 --> 02:36:19.840]  get the camp david accord done and you know so much more i mean you really are somebody that
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:26.240]  actually knows what's going on not pop garbage so just a brief synopsis of these people well number
[02:36:26.240 --> 02:36:30.800]  one they're not crazy but let's get it very clear and your audience has to understand it they're
[02:36:30.800 --> 02:36:37.920]  not schizophrenic there's nothing psychotic about them these are very willful determined sociopath
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:43.920]  sociopath meaning that by definition they grew up not caring about guilt responsibility
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:50.080]  accountability so once you have that dynamic in there you have entitlement once you have entitlement
[02:36:50.080 --> 02:36:55.840]  that means that you should be voting for me then you go to pandering the most like obama
[02:36:55.840 --> 02:37:02.640]  and hillary and and bill clinton all have the same dynamic sociopathy lies of their histories
[02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:11.520]  lies about their own self-identity and basically they pander for favors in turn a system like the
[02:37:11.520 --> 02:37:17.520]  cia or intelligent system can recruit them very quickly when they're young it was done with obama
[02:37:17.520 --> 02:37:23.120]  because he was black his mother was a operative his grandfather was his grandmother and the same
[02:37:23.120 --> 02:37:28.720]  thing with bill clinton and menna and throughout his own history when he had to go to oxford and
[02:37:28.720 --> 02:37:35.280]  strobe talbert was his roommate who was classical cia from yale who cleaned up all the junk that
[02:37:35.280 --> 02:37:40.960]  bill clinton did and the same thing with hillary who has her own sexual problems is a history of
[02:37:40.960 --> 02:37:48.000]  lesbianism has a history of entitlement corruption and ineptness once you have that dynamic the
[02:37:48.000 --> 02:37:55.120]  ability of the power of the state through covert actions is very easy to manipulate these people
[02:37:55.120 --> 02:38:04.000]  and bring in the necessary they what we want you to do do what we want you to do and if you don't
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:09.280]  we'll get rid of you but the only way they're terminated the same way putin understood about
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:15.600]  the romanos about sar nipples and about stalin they die or they leave office they cannot be
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:22.960]  be they will not resign on their own obama is not crazy he's not sick he's inept he's arrogant
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:28.880]  he's entitled he's a sociopath but there's nothing crazy about him he's not very bright the fact that
[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:34.480]  he went to occidental college where all of my ex cia operatives teach and the fact he did not
[02:38:34.480 --> 02:38:39.600]  go to columbia went to harvard on affirmative action means that he was there because he's
[02:38:39.600 --> 02:38:45.440]  black and he can articulate all kinds of nonsense same thing with bill clinton never showed up at
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:51.760]  oxford was in moscow worked for the agency reported the guys who were in the agency sure so let me
[02:38:51.760 --> 02:38:55.200]  ask this in closing and i want to have you back up on this whole history sometimes it's intriguing
[02:38:55.200 --> 02:38:58.560]  i know what you're giving us is unfiltered you know from your own research what you see is the
[02:38:58.560 --> 02:39:02.480]  truth which for my research is incredibly accurate there's just somebody of you know the outside
[02:39:02.480 --> 02:39:08.160]  studying this and watching it closely who runs the cia then i mean i know it was the wall street
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:13.840]  the big mega banks that set it up well it was it was the dullest brothers to begin with who worked
[02:39:13.840 --> 02:39:19.920]  with the germans during world war two then it was james jesus engelton it was the wasps eventually
[02:39:19.920 --> 02:39:25.920]  it came to the catholics in what we call catholics in action in this particular case over about
[02:39:25.920 --> 02:39:32.480]  20 years it's been john brennan who's been a special assistant to obama and bush jr who came
[02:39:32.480 --> 02:39:38.880]  out of saudi arabia has a very checkered history of effectiveness even in the intelligence community
[02:39:38.880 --> 02:39:43.600]  he's known as not being very so we've got all these different factions we got the and now now now is
[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:48.800]  this this weird socialist stuff we're seeing on a pope the pope frances or or is this a separate
[02:39:48.800 --> 02:39:53.520]  catholic frances as i told you and i told the audience i knew him when he was the director
[02:39:53.520 --> 02:40:00.240]  of the jesuit he's a ruthless cunning pandering individual who doesn't deserve to be the pope
[02:40:00.240 --> 02:40:05.440]  and i have great respect for catholics but i have no respect for the pope he allowed two of his
[02:40:05.440 --> 02:40:11.120]  jesuits to be arrested and several of the nuns to be killed and i was asked to come in by the
[02:40:11.120 --> 02:40:17.840]  argentinian kernels to help out and i said no i will not incarcerate six thousand catholics
[02:40:17.840 --> 02:40:24.320]  in argentina so the pope is also one of those sociopaths who instead of uh coming through as
[02:40:24.320 --> 02:40:30.240]  as grandiose does the reverse which is exactly grandiose he says oh no i'm not worthy and then
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:36.080]  uses all of the nonsense about hope and i tell you dr pacenic all reaction formation i know when
[02:40:36.080 --> 02:40:39.440]  you talk about so many degrees yes sir i didn't rupture i know when you talk about some of these
[02:40:39.440 --> 02:40:44.720]  histories you literally have the fbi show up because i mean people can go now i don't come in
[02:40:44.720 --> 02:40:49.680]  there and so what i mean they've shown repeatedly over 30 years that they don't work for america
[02:40:49.680 --> 02:40:53.760]  sure i just want the audience to know you're not making any of this stuff up you really
[02:40:54.320 --> 02:40:59.120]  you know did know this pope you you really did were involved in what happened in in big stuff in
[02:40:59.120 --> 02:41:03.440]  idly i mean obviously i'm not going to go into it because i don't have the fed show up over national
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:08.240]  security it's just so amazing the stuff you've actually done versus all people be opposing
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:12.160]  and acting like they've done all this stuff it's amazing i do want to have you on about the book

[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:37.520]  just it's just incredible uh and they they're just hate it when it comes on they just cannot

[02:41:51.120 --> 02:41:56.800]  it i have just been they cannot stand it and and look all we're doing is here exposing the stuff
[02:41:56.800 --> 02:42:04.160]  that's going on look jacari jackson two years ago the non-salazar and kit daniels went down the border
[02:42:04.160 --> 02:42:09.600]  we got contacted by the board patrol that they're the good guys and said yeah we're completing the
[02:42:09.600 --> 02:42:14.080]  spelling process we blurred out the ice agent's face or you just sat in the truck and talked to
[02:42:14.080 --> 02:42:22.400]  him she couldn't even see the body scrambled his voice and he sent us over there uh june 26th uh we
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:29.040]  we we we posted a flashback of this but this was june of 2014 where it shows dozens of buses
[02:42:29.040 --> 02:42:33.280]  a day hundreds and hundreds of people whole families none of them vetted not checked for
[02:42:33.280 --> 02:42:39.360]  diseases from all over the world just let in caught red-handed border patrol paying to ship
[02:42:39.360 --> 02:42:42.800]  me legals deep into the u.s and i'm not going to play the whole sub-minute report play about a
[02:42:42.800 --> 02:42:48.080]  minute i don't go to jacari but they're down there to just point out and talk to the locals what do
[02:42:48.080 --> 02:42:54.000]  you think of they're not tested for disease that's number one 22 increase in tb in quote migrants
[02:42:55.520 --> 02:42:59.920]  they're coming in they check you when you come to the border at customs as a citizen but they're
[02:42:59.920 --> 02:43:06.080]  not checking these people it's against the law the supreme court ruled you can't do it last week
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:11.280]  obama says he's going to continue i mean i sat there going through customs saturday and i didn't
[02:43:11.280 --> 02:43:15.600]  start arguing i just said you know you they just let everybody in a very legal and the guy just said
[02:43:15.600 --> 02:43:19.760]  yeah i mean we've talked to the board patrol at the checkpoint why do you want to search
[02:43:19.760 --> 02:43:23.760]  a 70 miles into the u.s come back from big bend the border is open he goes yeah you're actually
[02:43:23.760 --> 02:43:29.440]  right going in but there's terrorists coming into the country see that's what i mean this doesn't
[02:43:29.440 --> 02:43:33.760]  make sense so here's a minute of jacari's report we're talking to the emergency manager of mcallin
[02:43:33.760 --> 02:43:40.240]  while this is important is on friday un says more central americans headed to the u.s and the first
[02:43:40.240 --> 02:43:44.320]  thing they say in the newscast is illegals are coming in they're illegal but they're sent here by
[02:43:44.320 --> 02:43:49.680]  the board patrol and they're just bust out and they make it like it's a wonderful thing i mean this
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:56.320]  is crazy if i sneak an illegal in we're talking five years in federal prison if i get a light
[02:43:56.320 --> 02:44:00.960]  sentence folks so we're talking to jacari jackson in just a moment but he's really just there to get
[02:44:00.960 --> 02:44:06.640]  all these reports and go with those angles hey what about the disease is coming in what about
[02:44:06.640 --> 02:44:10.240]  citizens having to get checked what about this not being covered in the media why is it finally
[02:44:10.240 --> 02:44:13.360]  being covered i want to talk to the tv station i want to talk to the emergency manager again and
[02:44:13.360 --> 02:44:16.640]  this is just two years later it's still every day hundreds they're there at the bus terminal
[02:44:17.520 --> 02:44:23.040]  so let's play club of jacari two years ago here it is the people who you're housing here where they
[02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:28.080]  coming from i'm being told they're coming from central america a lot of them are central america
[02:44:28.080 --> 02:44:35.520]  a lot of them are younger kids uh with their moms for the most part and why central america why is
[02:44:35.520 --> 02:44:40.240]  that uh the popular i have no idea well what happened to today in particular is that the
[02:44:40.240 --> 02:44:45.440]  border patrol dropped off some they call them detainees but obviously they're not detained
[02:44:45.440 --> 02:44:51.120]  after they dropped them off and uh normally they have tickets or arrange transportation to go somewhere
[02:44:51.120 --> 02:44:56.400]  in the interior well today apparently for some logistical reasons some of them didn't
[02:44:56.400 --> 02:45:01.680]  hadn't had transportation arranged or their transportation is tomorrow right i'm gonna stop
[02:45:01.680 --> 02:45:06.880]  right there having to find now 70 percent are underage 18 or younger that that's the fed zone
[02:45:06.880 --> 02:45:13.920]  numbers we're on the jacari right now but the new video we have from this abc they're almost all
[02:45:13.920 --> 02:45:20.000]  look like men and women hardly any kids this time or teenagers so again folks this is a set deal
[02:45:20.000 --> 02:45:24.000]  outside the law and they're keeping the numbers secret jacari i know you just got down there in
[02:45:24.000 --> 02:45:28.000]  the last 30 minutes or so and you're about to follow your reports for the nightly news a great job
[02:45:28.000 --> 02:45:32.240]  breaking those two years ago to you and adan uh but the mainstream media knows they've been covering
[02:45:32.240 --> 02:45:38.720]  up what have you learned so far jacari jackson reporting from mcallin texas as you either report
[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:43.120]  right there it finally seems that the mainstream media is getting around to cover a story that we
[02:45:43.120 --> 02:45:48.560]  talked about two years ago about how many people who enter the country illegally are being provided
[02:45:48.560 --> 02:45:53.920]  with travel vouchers courtesy of the united states government and they go wherever they go and most
[02:45:53.920 --> 02:45:58.160]  of them don't return for their for their court dates and that's the situation that's going on
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:03.120]  here currently while we're at the mcallin bus station there isn't too much traffic right here
[02:46:03.120 --> 02:46:06.960]  we do know that the people are being provided with travel vouchers but just a simple fact that they
[02:46:06.960 --> 02:46:11.360]  are given a voucher makes it very difficult to identify so you you don't know exactly who
[02:46:11.360 --> 02:46:17.920]  came in with the travel voucher who didn't and where they're going from here jacari just as a
[02:46:17.920 --> 02:46:22.480]  citizen what is it like for you what i know you recently went on a trip to do some investigations
[02:46:22.480 --> 02:46:28.640]  in in in asia what is it like to because you're a citizen to be discriminated against to be asked
[02:46:28.640 --> 02:46:32.080]  all these questions and go through naked body scanners but then even at the airports they
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:37.040]  admit with a lot of the illegals that they're just groveling to them from china you name it
[02:46:37.040 --> 02:46:40.720]  just they don't even search them they just let them in without even having ids i mean that's crazy
[02:46:41.440 --> 02:46:47.120]  well it is rather absurd because when i return to the states i believe i was at jfk and you know i'm
[02:46:47.120 --> 02:46:51.360]  a us citizen i have my passport you know id and all that and the guy's giving me the third degree
[02:46:51.360 --> 02:46:54.480]  like i did something like where did you come from did you bring the thing back like and
[02:46:54.480 --> 02:46:57.920]  he's like did you go business of pleasure and he just was like grilling me i was like bro i'm from
[02:46:57.920 --> 02:47:02.800]  tulsa oklahoma like what do you think i was out there doing i have a christian cross on my arm
[02:47:02.800 --> 02:47:07.920]  what do you what do you think i'm up to uh but that's the situation i have but as you demonstrated
[02:47:07.920 --> 02:47:10.960]  in your example there are many other people who come from other countries don't have to go through
[02:47:10.960 --> 02:47:16.800]  the same harassment i do as an american citizen well i mean i threw out the three things i want
[02:47:16.800 --> 02:47:21.440]  you to cover the disease the above the law the open borders the un calling the shots because
[02:47:21.440 --> 02:47:26.160]  we played a clip last week where the un admits they're running the migration to european here
[02:47:26.160 --> 02:47:30.160]  let's see obama takes his orders from uh i mean what about the angle of obama just ignoring the
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:35.120]  supreme court again well obama doesn't get his authority from the supreme court according to
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:39.760]  him he gets it from the un so he doesn't have to abide by any of the laws of the land regardless
[02:47:39.760 --> 02:47:45.120]  of what the people of united states collectively speak he just ignores that and he goes on about
[02:47:45.120 --> 02:47:52.480]  his own personal agenda well all i know is why do i have to pay taxes and pay and have my genitals
[02:47:52.480 --> 02:47:57.120]  groped and everything but but all these foreigners they admit flights every day to jfk no one's even
[02:47:57.120 --> 02:48:02.320]  checked ids aren't even looked at that's new york daily news this is bull i mean i'm sitting
[02:48:02.320 --> 02:48:07.440]  with the customs guy narrowing his eyes you know it's full well who i am he's interrogating me every
[02:48:07.440 --> 02:48:10.400]  time they pull me out of the line for extra interrogation sometimes they take me behind
[02:48:10.400 --> 02:48:15.840]  closed doors dig to my dirty underwear literally and just bug their eyes out at me i mean it's it's
[02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:21.200]  crazy it's a power trip you know i've experienced those same things going through customs also when
[02:48:21.200 --> 02:48:25.760]  you go through the tsa i mean i've had multiple times i went to tsa and some guy he opened my
[02:48:25.760 --> 02:48:29.840]  altoids can and was shaking the can around trying to see if there's stuff in there it's just it's
[02:48:29.840 --> 02:48:34.000]  completely ridiculous it's a complete double standard but i guess in the sake of political
[02:48:34.000 --> 02:48:39.120]  correctness they feel they can do that to the american citizen but not the non citizen absolutely
[02:48:39.120 --> 02:48:42.480]  you heard the angles i want to get covered and and you know obviously there's a big angle the
[02:48:42.480 --> 02:48:47.600]  media finally covers that obama and the war patrol are shipping the illegals in i mean what
[02:48:47.600 --> 02:48:51.600]  what other angles you're gonna hit jacari well we're gonna go out here do a man on the street
[02:48:51.600 --> 02:48:54.720]  and since we're so close to the border one of the things we want to ask people is how do you
[02:48:54.720 --> 02:48:59.840]  feel about the wall because we see in the reports i believe it was on ms mbc where they went out and
[02:48:59.840 --> 02:49:03.280]  asked a similar question and they were surprised that many people said they wanted it so we're
[02:49:03.280 --> 02:49:06.480]  going to just ask the people who actually live here not you know some talking head up in new
[02:49:06.480 --> 02:49:10.080]  york what they think of the wall if they think it's a good thing it's a bad thing what they think
[02:49:10.080 --> 02:49:16.080]  about uh the situation in general sure and when ms mbc did that they they spent two months actually
[02:49:16.080 --> 02:49:20.240]  at the border town the farmers the ranchers were mainly hispanic where they're getting hit by the
[02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:23.760]  crime i think a lot of folks who found the city are probably they're illegal so they might be
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:29.040]  supporting it but that's my point we don't even need a wall we just need to go after employers
[02:49:29.040 --> 02:49:33.840]  that hire people illegally flagrantly and we need to just not ship people in and advertise
[02:49:33.840 --> 02:49:40.480]  all this free welfare game over yeah that's a good point you know if i don't think the wall is
[02:49:40.480 --> 02:49:44.560]  the best of ideas but if we enforce the laws that are already on the books i think we could
[02:49:44.560 --> 02:49:48.640]  cut down on the problem a great deal well i agree with ron paul when he said like five years ago
[02:49:48.640 --> 02:49:52.240]  they're talking about a wall and you'll never finish it he said look the wall's going to keep us in
[02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:57.280]  that's true they harass us the citizens i don't even blame the board patrol people that's what
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:02.560]  they're ordered to do the customs people but still it's happening uh so so no it look the irs
[02:50:02.560 --> 02:50:07.120]  wants a law where you can't even fly period if they claim they're investigating you now you can't
[02:50:07.120 --> 02:50:11.200]  leave the country if they've got an investigation open so see i they're trying to make it hard for
[02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:15.120]  us to get out of the country so i just say you know what i disagree with trump on the wall
[02:50:15.120 --> 02:50:19.680]  it's a fun thing to talk about and all this but uh uh all i want trump to do is just not let you
[02:50:19.680 --> 02:50:24.800]  know the illegals get free welfare that'll fix it right there and as you talk about this travel i
[02:50:24.800 --> 02:50:28.560]  i think if they want to take people's passports and deny them travel because they're under
[02:50:28.560 --> 02:50:32.720]  investigation mr clinton's under investigation why doesn't somebody say something about that and
[02:50:32.720 --> 02:50:37.600]  sees her assets oh that's a good idea absolutely we're not even talking about a criminal investigation
[02:50:37.600 --> 02:50:41.440]  with a grand jury or something folks are you know where you've been indicted and they say don't
[02:50:41.440 --> 02:50:45.520]  leave the county we're talking about anybody when they just open investigation that's probably happened
[02:50:45.520 --> 02:50:50.320]  to me six seven times in my life everybody else she knows had the iris and the letters of open
[02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:55.520]  investigation boom can't leave the us when they got the investigation open and i mean that is that
[02:50:55.520 --> 02:51:00.880]  is incredible we'll come back with jacari anadon salazar then david night paid non-attorney spokesperson

[02:57:27.680 --> 02:57:32.400]  but something i'm even that good it's that they won't do their job i mean how many news items

[03:09:06.080 --> 03:09:10.240]  parallel to what he's doing across the country so we'll talk about that a little bit we're also
[03:09:10.240 --> 03:09:18.240]  going to talk about some uh trump news as well as the whiny millennials in brexit and what's
[03:09:18.240 --> 03:09:23.040]  really behind that let's talk about the supreme court decision first now this is a the report on
[03:09:23.040 --> 03:09:27.760]  it from the wall street journal headline says supreme court rejects the texas abortion law as
[03:09:27.760 --> 03:09:33.600]  an undue burden an undue burden now understand this was a five to three vote so would not have made
[03:09:33.600 --> 03:09:40.080]  any difference if skelly had been around it would have been a five four vote this was made possible
[03:09:40.080 --> 03:09:44.720]  because we had anthony kennedy who many people thought well it's going to be a four four split
[03:09:44.720 --> 03:09:48.880]  it will go back to a lower court which is already thrown out this charge they're very lost at the
[03:09:48.880 --> 03:09:57.760]  lower level so the law will stand the texas law will stand but that didn't happen instead we had
[03:09:57.760 --> 03:10:03.840]  a justice that was appointed by ronald reagan joining two justices from clinton and two justices
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:10.880]  from obama say how that works say it's not a very good strategy is it to try to make sure
[03:10:10.880 --> 03:10:17.520]  that the constitution is going to be saved by appointing judges yes a good idea to try to do
[03:10:17.520 --> 03:10:24.560]  that we should try to appoint judges who will rule according to law but understand that there's a
[03:10:24.560 --> 03:10:28.320]  lot of judges there already and of course it's all it's going to get worse if hillary clinton
[03:10:28.320 --> 03:10:33.440]  wins she's going to appoint the types of judges that ruled here that said we don't care what the
[03:10:33.440 --> 03:10:37.520]  law says we don't care what the legal procedure is we like abortion and that's it if you think
[03:10:37.520 --> 03:10:44.160]  that's a stupid characterization of this an oversimplification of it it's not the first thing
[03:10:44.160 --> 03:10:50.320]  that this dissent from elito talks about and let's go back to the law first okay this is
[03:10:50.320 --> 03:10:55.520]  something going back to 2013 this is a texas law was signed in by rick perry and what it did was
[03:10:55.520 --> 03:11:00.800]  it required abortion clinics to have the same standards that ambulatory surgical centers would
[03:11:00.800 --> 03:11:06.000]  have that they would have physicians there who were really physicians they were admitted to
[03:11:06.000 --> 03:11:10.800]  hospital privileges within 30 miles they also enacted a lot of other safety regulations
[03:11:10.800 --> 03:11:17.600]  that previously had not been enacted against abortion clinics things like smoke detectors and
[03:11:17.600 --> 03:11:24.400]  making sure that you can get a gurney through the aisles of the little house and in many cases
[03:11:24.400 --> 03:11:31.360]  these were not purpose built clinics many of these were just simply homes that had been repurposed
[03:11:31.360 --> 03:11:36.560]  as an abortion clinic residential homes and so there were impediments in terms of being able
[03:11:36.560 --> 03:11:42.480]  to get somebody out of there in case an emergency procedure had occurred wouldn't you think those
[03:11:42.480 --> 03:11:47.200]  would be reasonable wouldn't you think that if this really was about women's health as we're
[03:11:47.200 --> 03:11:52.800]  being told that they would want to have these kinds of safeguards in there you see it brilliantly
[03:11:52.800 --> 03:12:01.120]  called the bluff of these people who simply want to murder babies as part of a eugenics agenda and
[03:12:01.120 --> 03:12:04.640]  we've exposed that over and over again that's how the start of the market singers how it started
[03:12:04.640 --> 03:12:09.680]  with plain parenthood you can go back and you can see the writings of the democrats and the
[03:12:09.680 --> 03:12:15.680]  republicans all the generations of the george bush family going back to press scott bush
[03:12:15.680 --> 03:12:23.280]  bush and then going through george hw as well as just recently in the debates remember when
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:27.200]  jeb was talking about how well we stopped the funding we had about a half million or whatever
[03:12:27.200 --> 03:12:33.280]  the number was i can't remember it was uh it was essentially 30 times the amount of money he donated
[03:12:33.280 --> 03:12:37.840]  with his private organization to plan parenthood but publicly what he did was he stopped a little
[03:12:37.840 --> 03:12:43.440]  bit of funding from the state of florida that's the way the bushes have been of course the his
[03:12:43.440 --> 03:12:48.560]  grandfather was the first treasurer of planned parenthood along with margaret singer we've
[03:12:48.560 --> 03:12:54.960]  shown you the letters we've shown you the letters from george hw bush and so forth and so on so
[03:12:56.320 --> 03:13:03.200]  we've had a long history of the elites in both republican and democrat party who are interested
[03:13:03.200 --> 03:13:09.360]  quite frankly in eugenics and they're not interested in women's health and this is similar to the
[03:13:09.360 --> 03:13:14.960]  situation that we had when we had the epa under lisa jackson we talked about this many times it's
[03:13:14.960 --> 03:13:20.800]  the first story i covered when i got here they were hooking people up to tailpipes of diesel
[03:13:20.800 --> 03:13:25.440]  motors okay putting them in a room and at the university of north carolina and of course university
[03:13:25.440 --> 03:13:29.840]  north carolina i got a little bit of news on them as well here a new story about them christmas
[03:13:29.840 --> 03:13:35.440]  vacations now microaggression along with terms like boyfriend and girlfriend and i love your shoes
[03:13:35.440 --> 03:13:42.240]  things like that okay u n c in chapel hill is a loony ben i used to live close to there and i can
[03:13:42.240 --> 03:13:47.120]  tell you that it is over the top it's it's like uh it's like a university in california or something
[03:13:47.120 --> 03:13:55.760]  been anyway uh at the u at u n c along with the epa they were hooking people up to diesel tailpipes
[03:13:56.320 --> 03:14:02.080]  they had asked for volunteers who had respiratory issues who had heart issues because they wanted
[03:14:02.080 --> 03:14:07.840]  people to have problems and they did they found some people who did have some problems and we had a
[03:14:08.880 --> 03:14:15.440]  spot on researcher who was working uh steve malloy who was working on this and noticed it and and
[03:14:16.160 --> 03:14:21.760]  expanded it we tried to get that stopped but here's the point we'd had lisa jackson go before
[03:14:21.760 --> 03:14:26.800]  congress and say i'm not talking about people getting sick i'm talking about people dying from
[03:14:26.800 --> 03:14:34.720]  this and so we have to do more to squash diesel engines and to enact more regulations from the
[03:14:34.720 --> 03:14:42.400]  epa she actually said that it was a dog and pony show that was orchestrated and scripted by marky
[03:14:42.400 --> 03:14:47.600]  out of um massachusetts he was a congressman at the time now he's moved up because he does stuff like
[03:14:47.600 --> 03:14:55.280]  that he's now senator so they scripted this thing and said no we're talking about it killing people
[03:14:55.280 --> 03:15:00.640]  and then they go out and they expose these people to 72 times the level that they said was already
[03:15:00.640 --> 03:15:08.080]  fatal so we said wait is this a war crime situation or are you just lying to people when you said it
[03:15:08.080 --> 03:15:12.480]  was it was going to kill people so when you look at these laws with the texas abortion law they say
[03:15:12.480 --> 03:15:18.080]  oh we just are here for women's health we say oh really well then let's make sure that these are
[03:15:18.080 --> 03:15:24.320]  safe procedures so they call their bluff and they put out this law there and it was struck down again
[03:15:24.320 --> 03:15:30.160]  uh justice kennedy a reagan justice uh switched sides and as wall street journal points out justice
[03:15:30.160 --> 03:15:37.200]  elito who wrote the main dissent rocked back and forth in his chair as justice bryer spoke he was
[03:15:37.200 --> 03:15:42.640]  very upset about this frowning and apparent disagreement for the second time in a week justice
[03:15:42.640 --> 03:15:48.560]  elito summarizes the scent from the bench a signal of his intense disagreement with the majority
[03:15:48.560 --> 03:15:54.160]  speaking for about 10 minutes justice elito said the majority had thrown aside standard
[03:15:54.160 --> 03:15:58.320]  legal procedures to strike down the texas law ignoring rules that should have precluded the
[03:15:58.320 --> 03:16:04.160]  court from considering the appeal altogether now what was the deal with it well you know
[03:16:04.160 --> 03:16:09.360]  interestingly enough we see all this stuff out of brexit people saying we need to do over i'm not
[03:16:09.360 --> 03:16:15.120]  happy with the results i want to hold another election i don't like that okay that's essentially
[03:16:15.120 --> 03:16:21.680]  what this was this in principle this whole supreme court decision was essentially a do over for these
[03:16:21.680 --> 03:16:26.720]  people and that's what he was pointing out it was also ignoring the law also ignoring legal
[03:16:26.720 --> 03:16:32.640]  principles and it was pure activism this is not a review of the law this is not a review of the
[03:16:32.640 --> 03:16:39.280]  constitution this is nothing less than naked judicial activism and that's why justice elito
[03:16:39.280 --> 03:16:44.080]  was rocking back and forth in his seat he could barely contain himself he could hardly sit there
[03:16:44.080 --> 03:16:48.720]  and listen to this nonsense and then he wrote this opinion and i pulled up his opinion
[03:16:48.720 --> 03:16:52.240]  and i want to read you part of it because these opinions are very long this is like
[03:16:52.240 --> 03:16:57.040]  150 pages of stuff to sort through this is what he has to say at the beginning of his opinion
[03:16:57.040 --> 03:17:00.960]  he says the constitutionality of laws regulation of regulating abortion is one of the most
[03:17:00.960 --> 03:17:06.720]  controversial issues in american law but in this case does not require us to delve into that
[03:17:06.720 --> 03:17:13.200]  contentious dispute you understand he said okay regardless of what you think about the issue
[03:17:13.200 --> 03:17:18.800]  there are legal principles here that would keep us from being involved in this he said instead
[03:17:18.800 --> 03:17:24.720]  the issue here concerns a work a day question that can arise in any case no matter the subject
[03:17:24.720 --> 03:17:32.160]  namely whether the present case is barred by res judica judica okay uh and so what he talks about
[03:17:32.160 --> 03:17:38.000]  with that is he's essentially saying hey look to put that in layman's terms okay because i'm not a
[03:17:38.000 --> 03:17:43.920]  lawyer but he explains it in his opinion he says it's basically claim preclusion it's a bedrock
[03:17:43.920 --> 03:17:51.440]  principle he writes later on in his decision he says if you lose on an issue you don't get a do-over
[03:17:51.440 --> 03:17:56.480]  you don't get a do-over just like you don't get a do-over with brexit and he goes on to say here
[03:17:56.480 --> 03:18:02.880]  he said here's the worst example shortly after texas enacted this bill the petitioners in this
[03:18:02.880 --> 03:18:07.680]  case brought suit claiming among other things that a provision of the new law requiring a physician
[03:18:07.680 --> 03:18:13.440]  performing an abortion to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital is facially unconstitutional
[03:18:13.440 --> 03:18:18.080]  and thus totally unenforceable petitioners had a fair opportunity to make their case but they
[03:18:18.080 --> 03:18:23.040]  lost on the merits in the court of appeals for the fifth circuit and they chose not to petition
[03:18:23.040 --> 03:18:29.680]  the supreme court at that time so the judgment became final so they lost they lost but then they
[03:18:29.680 --> 03:18:35.040]  come back a few years later say we want to do over on that like brexit okay this is precisely what
[03:18:35.040 --> 03:18:40.160]  is happening with this and he goes you can't get to do that this is exactly this case this is in
[03:18:40.160 --> 03:18:47.440]  a similar case this is exactly that case you lost you didn't appeal you don't get to come back now
[03:18:47.440 --> 03:18:53.760]  and do this okay under the rules that apply in regular cases he says petitioners could not
[03:18:53.760 --> 03:19:00.880]  relitigate the exact same claim in a second suit the exact same claim as we have said a losing
[03:19:00.880 --> 03:19:06.320]  litigant and he quotes the supreme court and he gives you book chapter and verse okay quote a
[03:19:06.320 --> 03:19:13.200]  losing litigant deserves no rematch after a defeat fairly suffered in adversarial proceedings on an
[03:19:13.200 --> 03:19:19.520]  issue identical in substance to the one he subsequently seeks to raise you get that okay
[03:19:19.520 --> 03:19:25.680]  in other words no do-overs folks now he says however because this is an abortion case we throw
[03:19:25.680 --> 03:19:30.240]  out the law we throw out the rules we throw out all of our previous opinions he said
[03:19:30.240 --> 03:19:36.720]  this rule is now disregarded in the court awards of victory to petitioners on the very exact claim
[03:19:36.720 --> 03:19:43.120]  they unsuccessfully pressed in the earlier case now when we come back there's more there's more
[03:19:43.120 --> 03:19:48.640]  that is ignored on this and i want to read to you what the supreme court decision says why they
[03:19:48.640 --> 03:19:56.400]  said they did this it's absolutely amazing and it i think it underscores why we cannot trust
[03:19:56.400 --> 03:20:00.640]  nine political appointees to safeguard the constitution that's an idiotic idea this is
[03:20:00.640 --> 03:20:06.160]  ron paul i'm a former 22 year congressman and republican presidential candidate i'm here to

[03:24:34.000 --> 03:24:39.920]  actually giving a do over which is against their previous rulings it's against the law to do this
[03:24:39.920 --> 03:24:44.240]  these people already lost they didn't appeal the case but now they gave them a do over and said
[03:24:44.240 --> 03:24:49.680]  no right and now we're going to reverse what happened earlier and then of course in politics
[03:24:49.680 --> 03:24:57.760]  we see over this weekend an orchestrated attempt by the never trumper gop i'm with her hillary people
[03:24:57.760 --> 03:25:02.640]  okay people like george will national review david french the guy that was a candidate for
[03:25:02.640 --> 03:25:09.600]  about a week you got this guy whose file suit in north carolina in virginia they want a do over
[03:25:09.600 --> 03:25:16.560]  as well they want to say hey we are delegates and we have superior first amendment rights to
[03:25:16.560 --> 03:25:22.000]  you people are what our opinion is it matters more than millions of voters in these elections
[03:25:22.000 --> 03:25:27.600]  and so we're going to say that you can't penalize me we're going to sue you over this so over and
[03:25:27.600 --> 03:25:33.280]  over again we're seeing people say we want to do over the abortion law brexit the gop convention
[03:25:33.280 --> 03:25:38.080]  everybody is saying hey i didn't win and i'm not going so i'm going to change all the rules right
[03:25:38.080 --> 03:25:42.800]  now i'm going to say all the rules don't apply and i'm going to do whatever i have to i'm going to
[03:25:42.800 --> 03:25:47.280]  suspend your free speech because i don't want to debate science with you when it's climate change
[03:25:47.840 --> 03:25:52.080]  i don't want to hear what you have to say so i'm going to call you a hateful racist and shut you
[03:25:52.080 --> 03:25:59.920]  down with hate speech laws i'm going to do whatever i can to silence to censor you to pervert the law
[03:25:59.920 --> 03:26:05.840]  the rule of law the rules of democracy the rules of our republic just so i can get my way this is
[03:26:05.840 --> 03:26:10.320]  what we're seeing increasingly so i want to break this down because as i pointed out before
[03:26:10.320 --> 03:26:17.040]  Justice Alito could barely contain his anger he was rocking back and forth in his seat and i would
[03:26:17.040 --> 03:26:21.120]  have been too if i had been there i would have been going back and forth i was like i can't
[03:26:21.120 --> 03:26:26.080]  believe this is happening this is just we're throwing everything out and we've seen the supreme
[03:26:26.080 --> 03:26:30.320]  court do this before we saw them do it on gay marriage regardless of what you think about
[03:26:30.320 --> 03:26:35.360]  gay marriage they have no jurisdiction where is it in the supreme court this says the federal
[03:26:35.360 --> 03:26:39.760]  government will have jurisdiction over defining marriage there is nothing in the constitution
[03:26:39.760 --> 03:26:46.000]  that delegates that to them we had people who were very concerned who did not want to have a
[03:26:46.000 --> 03:26:51.120]  federal government the anti-federalists they called them they said we don't want to have this we know
[03:26:51.120 --> 03:26:55.600]  that this is going to turn into a monster that is going to dictate the most minute details of our
[03:26:55.600 --> 03:27:01.760]  lives assuming and concentrating power to itself and that's what's happened and so they passed
[03:27:01.760 --> 03:27:06.000]  the bill of rights and they said this is off limits that's off limits that's off limits that's off
[03:27:06.000 --> 03:27:11.200]  off limits and then they said oh and by the way in case we forgot anything we're going to write
[03:27:11.200 --> 03:27:15.680]  a ninth and a tenth amendment and we're going to say if we didn't specifically give this power to
[03:27:15.680 --> 03:27:22.080]  you specifically then you don't have it anything that's not been delegated to you remains the power
[03:27:22.080 --> 03:27:26.480]  of the people and of the state governments that's the ninth and tenth amendment essentially
[03:27:26.480 --> 03:27:31.920]  they just ignore that and if they like the cause the supreme court has shown that it will just set
[03:27:31.920 --> 03:27:38.320]  aside all the legal process and this is why Judge Alito was so upset about this and we had other
[03:27:38.320 --> 03:27:42.720]  people on we've had we had Lionel we're talking about the gay marriage thing he thought thought it
[03:27:42.720 --> 03:27:47.360]  was a good deal I don't like that definition of marriage but we both agreed that they don't have
[03:27:47.360 --> 03:27:53.680]  any legal authority to define it so I mean it's something that ought to be decided at the state
[03:27:53.680 --> 03:27:57.680]  levels at the community levels before I get back to that real quickly we're kind of a couple of
[03:27:57.680 --> 03:28:04.000]  sales that are ending soon I want to let you know about these as the 20 off for deep cleanse and of

[03:28:15.680 --> 03:28:21.120]  product instead of buying five six or seven different cleansing products we've used decades of

[03:28:58.960 --> 03:29:07.600]  design and to say the least it will be a conversation starter because as we've seen many times many
[03:29:07.600 --> 03:29:14.800]  people look at it as such a dead ringer knockoff of the hillary for president appearance but it's
[03:29:14.800 --> 03:29:20.960]  hillary for prison and so that gets a conversation started let's talk about what's going on with
[03:29:20.960 --> 03:29:26.080]  the uh supreme court situation when we come back we're going to take a look at this move to shut
[03:29:26.080 --> 03:29:30.720]  down the trump nomination can you believe that they're still trying to do this it's absolutely
[03:29:30.720 --> 03:29:37.520]  unbelievable and then we're going to look at the whiny millennials who say those baby boomers they
[03:29:37.520 --> 03:29:42.800]  are ruining our future and you've seen the memes on social media where they show the inversion
[03:29:42.800 --> 03:29:48.720]  that uh the vast majority of people who are younger voted to stay in and vice versa at the
[03:29:48.720 --> 03:29:55.840]  older age we're right back the empires on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:30:00.400 --> 03:30:04.560]  finally the mainstream media is reporting on what we broke two years ago the us customs and
[03:30:04.560 --> 03:30:08.560]  border patrol under pressure from the obama administration is purchasing bus tickets for
[03:30:08.560 --> 03:30:12.880]  illegals to ship them deeper in the country at taxpayers expense local news station car gv is
[03:30:12.880 --> 03:30:17.360]  now covering how the mcgallon texas bus station is used as a transit hub for illegals obama is
[03:30:17.360 --> 03:30:22.640]  bringing into the country which info wars.com exclusively broke in 2014 when no one else dared
[03:30:22.640 --> 03:30:27.440]  to report on it k r gv revealed that over a hundred legals a day are being dropped off at the mcgallon
[03:30:27.440 --> 03:30:32.560]  station and in 2014 info wars reported on how the obama administration was ordering the border
[03:30:32.560 --> 03:30:36.800]  patrol to release illegals they've apprehended after crossing the border but as part of their
[03:30:36.800 --> 03:30:41.600]  release the legals are transported to the mcgallon bus station by border patrol agents who then buy
[03:30:41.600 --> 03:30:46.720]  them tickets to go wherever they want to go in the us so for example if the legals have relatives
[03:30:46.720 --> 03:30:51.120]  in boston that's where they get to go and taxpayers are paying for this illegal smuggling

[03:33:09.280 --> 03:33:14.400]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[03:33:14.400 --> 03:33:26.880]  and we're talking about the do-over mentality that we've got here the spoiled
[03:33:26.880 --> 03:33:33.680]  brats everywhere from britain to the supreme court to the republican party i didn't get my way
[03:33:33.680 --> 03:33:38.560]  i want it done over again i don't care what the rules are i want it my way that's exactly what
[03:33:38.560 --> 03:33:42.480]  they're saying and that's what justice elito was pointing out the supreme court just did
[03:33:42.480 --> 03:33:48.080]  it and so to summarize what i was saying earlier what he did was he said look they already appealed
[03:33:48.080 --> 03:33:52.640]  this they lost at a circuit court level they did not appeal it to the supreme court so that
[03:33:52.640 --> 03:33:59.520]  decision was final now they have come back with exactly the same case exactly the same law and
[03:33:59.520 --> 03:34:04.560]  tried to appeal it again they've already lost we don't allow that the supreme court has said
[03:34:04.560 --> 03:34:08.960]  that's not allowed it's a legal principle that's not allowed and then he goes on to say and here's
[03:34:08.960 --> 03:34:13.680]  another principle that they have here he says it doesn't even matter he says i understand abortion
[03:34:14.240 --> 03:34:19.920]  is a very contentious and divisive issue this doesn't even get to that it's a question of
[03:34:20.480 --> 03:34:26.240]  legal procedure if you lose a case and you don't appeal it you don't get a chance at a later date
[03:34:26.240 --> 03:34:31.520]  to relitigate a do-over okay that's what he said and then he goes you've got another
[03:34:31.520 --> 03:34:39.360]  uh standard rule of law that is ignored as well he said it's a severability clause the court's
[03:34:39.360 --> 03:34:44.720]  treatment of this texas laws severability clause he says when part of a statute is held to be
[03:34:44.720 --> 03:34:50.880]  unconstitutional the question arises whether other parts of the statute must also go if a statute
[03:34:50.880 --> 03:34:55.680]  says a provisions found and that are unconstitutional can be severed from the rest of the statute the
[03:34:55.680 --> 03:35:01.280]  valid provisions are allowed to stand you understand so they come in here and they say well you know
[03:35:01.280 --> 03:35:05.840]  we don't like this rule about the fact that you have to be admitted to a hospital they think that's
[03:35:05.840 --> 03:35:12.720]  too much of a burden okay fine then the other parts that say you've got to meet fire code
[03:35:12.720 --> 03:35:16.560]  inspections if you're going to do medical procedures in this little house that you just bought
[03:35:16.560 --> 03:35:22.480]  and you've now put a shingle out said this is a health clinic for women okay fine let's make
[03:35:22.480 --> 03:35:25.680]  sure they don't burn up while they're being treated there or let's make sure that you can get
[03:35:25.680 --> 03:35:32.240]  uh Gern Gernies inside here if somebody has to uh get pulled out quickly with an ambulance issues
[03:35:32.240 --> 03:35:39.520]  like that safety issues and he says uh for example he says uh if provisions can be found
[03:35:39.520 --> 03:35:43.680]  unconstitutional can be severed from the rest of the statute this the valid provisions are allowed
[03:35:43.680 --> 03:35:49.360]  to stand this law contains what surely must be the most emphatic severability clause that was
[03:35:49.360 --> 03:35:54.320]  ever written in other words they say in this law we've got all these different uh things here
[03:35:54.320 --> 03:36:00.800]  and each one of them is severable these are all separate regulations it isn't all together all
[03:36:00.800 --> 03:36:06.400]  or nothing each one of these things are separate and he says this is very explicit he said the
[03:36:06.400 --> 03:36:11.280]  clause says every single word of the statute and every possible application of its provisions
[03:36:11.280 --> 03:36:17.520]  are severable he says provisions that are indisputably constitutional for example provisions
[03:36:17.520 --> 03:36:23.200]  that require facilities performing abortions to follow basic fire safety measures are stricken
[03:36:23.200 --> 03:36:30.080]  now from the book okay based on the supreme court decision so they took all of the regulations out
[03:36:30.960 --> 03:36:36.880]  he says there's absolutely no possible justification for this collateral damage now let me read you the
[03:36:37.440 --> 03:36:42.640]  nonsense that was put out here by these five supreme court justices this is the basis for
[03:36:42.640 --> 03:36:48.240]  their decision the number of facilities providing abortions dropped in half and this is actually
[03:36:48.240 --> 03:36:55.040]  supreme court decision this is not this is not a new york times analysis of what's going on this
[03:36:55.040 --> 03:37:01.840]  is what the supreme court justices said was a basis for their uh their ruling the number of
[03:37:01.840 --> 03:37:08.960]  facilities providing abortions dropped in half from about 40 to about 20 this decrease in geographical
[03:37:08.960 --> 03:37:13.840]  distribution means that the number of women of reproductive age living more than 50 miles from
[03:37:13.840 --> 03:37:19.120]  the clinic has doubled the number living more than 100 miles away has increased by 150 the number
[03:37:19.120 --> 03:37:24.880]  living more than 150 miles away by more than 350 the number living more than 200 miles away by more
[03:37:24.880 --> 03:37:33.280]  than 2800% they see the issue here this is an issue of whether or not they like they want people
[03:37:33.280 --> 03:37:38.480]  to have abortions it doesn't even address the legal issues that judge elito was so upset about
[03:37:38.480 --> 03:37:46.160]  they just said well we like abortions we want them to be uh plentiful and easily accessible and so
[03:37:46.160 --> 03:37:51.440]  we don't like this and we're going to strike all of the rules including fire safety codes because
[03:37:51.440 --> 03:37:56.560]  you know this is about women's health this is about women's health isn't it what a baloney
[03:37:56.560 --> 03:38:03.040]  you know here are these people who have absolutely no health regulations and abortion clinics they
[03:38:03.040 --> 03:38:11.280]  struck them all yet they want to regulate every tiny detail of bathrooms they don't have an agenda
[03:38:11.280 --> 03:38:18.240]  do they no agenda whatsoever look at the university of north carolina christmas vacation is now a
[03:38:18.240 --> 03:38:23.280]  microaggression as i point out before this is an article it's up on info wars icon from the daily
[03:38:23.280 --> 03:38:28.160]  caller university north carolina at chapel hill issued a guide this week which instructs students
[03:38:28.160 --> 03:38:32.720]  at christmas vacations and telling a woman i love your shoes are microaggressions along with
[03:38:32.720 --> 03:38:39.680]  things like boyfriend and girlfriend so watch your speech okay watch your speech there's no free
[03:38:39.680 --> 03:38:45.440]  speech at this university and at the same time again we're talking about agendas here okay we've
[03:38:45.440 --> 03:38:53.280]  got obama declares the stonewall n to be the first national monument to lgbt rights this is from the
[03:38:53.280 --> 03:38:58.480]  guardian barack obama announced on friday that the stonewall national monument will be created
[03:38:58.480 --> 03:39:04.240]  outside the stonewall n in new york where gay men lesbians and drag queens reacted to a police
[03:39:04.240 --> 03:39:08.880]  raid in 1969 with a riot that spread and turned into the gay rights movement in america and around
[03:39:08.880 --> 03:39:14.000]  the world obama confirmed the widely expected news that he will be designating the first ever
[03:39:14.720 --> 03:39:22.640]  national monument to the lgbt equality movement okay so here you go that's his um that's his monument
[03:39:22.640 --> 03:39:29.280]  now because that's his agenda that's what he thinks is is important but understand what is
[03:39:29.280 --> 03:39:35.520]  happening as he's going in other parts rural areas of the country he's going in and saying well this
[03:39:35.520 --> 03:39:42.320]  is a very special petroglyph here for example and as i point out we've done this report i did it with
[03:39:42.320 --> 03:39:48.960]  rob Jacobson we need to update it now because they found a lady who is going out and using paint
[03:39:48.960 --> 03:39:55.040]  on these petroglyphs and you had harry reid blaming it on the bundy people and all these evil
[03:39:56.320 --> 03:40:01.680]  people associated with them and yet we find out that it was like a 20-something girl who was doing
[03:40:03.840 --> 03:40:08.560]  graffiti and actually caught her because she's putting it on facebook okay and doing it with
[03:40:08.560 --> 03:40:16.240]  paint over these ancient indian petroglyphs but obama is coming out not only are they falsely
[03:40:16.240 --> 03:40:21.840]  blaming the people that they are destroying their way of life taking their property rights
[03:40:21.840 --> 03:40:26.480]  taking their grazing rights their mining rights their surface and water rights their logging rights
[03:40:26.480 --> 03:40:31.440]  you name it all these rights that have been held since these states came into the union
[03:40:31.440 --> 03:40:35.200]  and these are property rights just like your home is a property right they're saying we got to have
[03:40:35.200 --> 03:40:40.160]  that we got to have millions of acres because of a petroglyph over here and oh by the way
[03:40:40.720 --> 03:40:45.760]  those petroglyphs are being vandalized and we're getting graffiti put on them and i know it's
[03:40:45.760 --> 03:40:50.880]  those bundy people i just know it's them and it's not and they don't need to take millions upon
[03:40:50.880 --> 03:40:56.000]  millions of acres in order to protect that a good example is one of the earlier monuments that we
[03:40:56.000 --> 03:41:00.240]  had in the national park service we talked about this in report devil's tower you know devil's
[03:41:00.240 --> 03:41:08.400]  tower the tower that you see and close encounters of the third kind was it third kind i think
[03:41:08.400 --> 03:41:12.880]  anyway that's spielberg movie not one of my favorites okay but you know he does the thing
[03:41:12.880 --> 03:41:19.360]  of mashed potatoes on the on the kitchen table and they all have this vision and they all assemble
[03:41:19.360 --> 03:41:26.640]  at devil's tower to preserve devil's tower they needed one and a half acres about the size of
[03:41:26.640 --> 03:41:32.080]  a football field and yet they're telling us because of some of these small petroglyphs they need
[03:41:32.080 --> 03:41:38.400]  literally millions of acres they lie about everything they lie about the purpose of it
[03:41:38.400 --> 03:41:43.840]  it and they lie about why it is needed and it's interesting tomorrow there's going to be a recall
[03:41:43.840 --> 03:41:50.480]  election in burns oregon near where that wildlife refuge was taken over by the bundies and the
[03:41:50.480 --> 03:41:55.680]  people in that town are very upset with the county judge kind of equivalent to is what we have here
[03:41:55.680 --> 03:42:02.800]  in texas i believe the county judge is equivalent to the mayor of a city okay is to a county what a
[03:42:02.800 --> 03:42:07.840]  mayor is to a city and there's a recall election there a lot of people who are business owners
[03:42:07.840 --> 03:42:13.040]  here's one of them linda gainer said the business she got from journalist agents occupiers protesters
[03:42:13.040 --> 03:42:17.680]  against the occupation and from protesters protesting the protesters she said she had a
[03:42:17.680 --> 03:42:21.920]  lot of business there she said i met really awesome people everybody that came through
[03:42:21.920 --> 03:42:28.720]  was very polite and we should have had a meeting there and yet this guy would not this judge that
[03:42:28.720 --> 03:42:34.720]  they're trying to recall would not allow anyone to have a meeting to talk about how the government
[03:42:34.720 --> 03:42:41.760]  was stealing millions of acres and stealing people's property rights that they had for 150
[03:42:41.760 --> 03:42:46.960]  years in many cases and that's the issue folks that truly is the issue you got another business
[03:42:46.960 --> 03:42:53.200]  owner who's afraid to put his name out there he's afraid of reprisals that's an issue of two isn't
[03:42:53.200 --> 03:43:00.000]  it in america we're afraid to speak out publicly because we're afraid of reprisals and so they're
[03:43:00.000 --> 03:43:04.160]  going to have a an election tomorrow to see whether or not that guy is going to be recalled i
[03:43:04.160 --> 03:43:09.200]  certainly hope that that is going to be the case but just just look at the fraud that is involved
[03:43:09.200 --> 03:43:15.600]  there i want to talk about the other winers and people calling for do-overs and that's within
[03:43:16.160 --> 03:43:23.360]  the political aspect here of the uh the republican national committee we've had a long time these
[03:43:23.360 --> 03:43:30.480]  people have been moving to try to subvert the elections just like they are in britain they
[03:43:30.480 --> 03:43:34.320]  didn't like the outcome they didn't like the fact that trump won so they said well we're going to
[03:43:34.320 --> 03:43:39.040]  steal it and we don't really care what the rules are and so now we've got a virginia delegate who
[03:43:39.040 --> 03:43:46.160]  has filed a class action lawsuit this last friday challenging a state law the virginia law that
[03:43:46.160 --> 03:43:51.920]  binds delegates to support the primary winner at the nominating convention he says in his name is
[03:43:51.920 --> 03:43:58.960]  bo coral uh he's a republican national convention delegate he served as one of ted cruises campaign
[03:43:58.960 --> 03:44:04.240]  co-chairs in virginia and he's the only named plaintiff in the suit but he says he's filing
[03:44:04.240 --> 03:44:08.400]  it on behalf of all republicans and all democrats and what he's i think we ought to call this the
[03:44:09.120 --> 03:44:16.000]  super delegate lawsuit because what he's trying to do is establish super delegates he says this
[03:44:16.000 --> 03:44:22.960]  is really awful he says i'm a delegate and i don't like donald trump and i don't like who the millions
[03:44:22.960 --> 03:44:29.040]  of uh virginia voters picked and now my first amendment choices are being shut down and we
[03:44:29.040 --> 03:44:34.480]  have a parallel article coming out at the same time interestingly enough interestingly enough
[03:44:34.480 --> 03:44:41.520]  from the national review and from david french remember david french uh he was uh bill crystals
[03:44:41.520 --> 03:44:49.200]  puppet bill crystal of the weekly standard spelled w e a k okay with an e and an a uh
[03:44:49.200 --> 03:44:54.400]  um he was we were told he had this independent candidate this guy was really strong it's gonna
[03:44:54.400 --> 03:44:59.120]  be a very viable candidate well david french is nothing but a reporter for national review
[03:44:59.760 --> 03:45:05.840]  and the weekly standard and his candidacy lasted i think less than a week but now interestingly
[03:45:05.840 --> 03:45:10.880]  enough for the national review he's written an article saying not a single republican
[03:45:10.880 --> 03:45:16.560]  delegate is bound to donald trump and using the same arguments that this guy in virginia is using
[03:45:16.560 --> 03:45:23.040]  in his lawsuit just a coincidence i'm sure don't you think now no uh no conspiracy here to try to
[03:45:23.040 --> 03:45:26.880]  subvert the will of the people in the elections now that would never happen now this is what the
[03:45:26.880 --> 03:45:31.520]  complaint says here's their argument the first amendment to the united states constitution guarantees
[03:45:31.520 --> 03:45:36.080]  delegates to the republican party and the democrat party's national conventions the right to vote
[03:45:36.080 --> 03:45:41.440]  their conscience free from government compulsion when participating in selection of their party's
[03:45:41.440 --> 03:45:46.480]  presidential nominee okay nevertheless the virginia law acts to strip them of that right
[03:45:46.480 --> 03:45:50.880]  imposing criminal penalties on delegates who vote for anyone other than the primary winner on the
[03:45:50.880 --> 03:45:55.840]  first ballot of a national convention oh other than the primary winner oh where did that how did
[03:45:55.840 --> 03:46:00.240]  that happen well you say we had these elections had these things called elections that we used to you
[03:46:00.240 --> 03:46:07.040]  know honor and we spent a lot of money in the state of virginia to run those elections for the
[03:46:07.040 --> 03:46:11.760]  republican party and there were certain things that were put out there assurances people that hey
[03:46:11.760 --> 03:46:15.600]  you know you vote this we're going to have trump is going to get delegates or cruises going to get
[03:46:15.600 --> 03:46:20.160]  delegates so trump won the delegates and then crews went around and tried to steal them again okay
[03:46:22.800 --> 03:46:28.080]  what is the problem with this why is it that we can say well here's the election these are the
[03:46:28.080 --> 03:46:34.400]  number of votes that donald trump got he won virginia overwhelmingly like these other states
[03:46:34.400 --> 03:46:40.800]  and then we say well wait a minute now that head cruises come in and oiled his way across the floor
[03:46:40.800 --> 03:46:45.600]  and whined and dined these people now they're not going to vote the way the voters wanted
[03:46:46.320 --> 03:46:53.680]  okay so i would ask bo coral and i would ask the gop what makes you think that you're so much
[03:46:53.680 --> 03:46:58.960]  better than everybody else and i would say that really what needs to be done they they they filed
[03:46:58.960 --> 03:47:07.360]  a a part of their lawsuit said that they were worried that donald trump would file a lawsuit
[03:47:07.360 --> 03:47:12.960]  against them they say because donald trump they said is quote known to be litigious and has brought
[03:47:12.960 --> 03:47:17.760]  lawsuits of questionable merit against persons for the apparent purpose of harassing or punishing
[03:47:17.760 --> 03:47:24.720]  them and i said wait a minute isn't that what this lawsuit is isn't this a litigious frivolous
[03:47:24.720 --> 03:47:31.680]  lawsuit isn't this a means of harassing and punishing the voters of virginia who didn't
[03:47:31.680 --> 03:47:38.000]  vote the way this little click of elitists that think that they are the gop party no the gop party
[03:47:38.000 --> 03:47:42.880]  is the voters and they're going to find this out if they try to do this now they say that
[03:47:44.880 --> 03:47:49.680]  he says i just can't follow in my own conscience i just can't vote for trump it's like fine don't go
[03:47:49.680 --> 03:47:55.280]  don't go you can leave let somebody else take your place they have alternates and you have to
[03:47:55.280 --> 03:48:00.480]  understand as i pointed out before when you go to the electoral college uh it's a winner state
[03:48:00.480 --> 03:48:06.400]  it's a winner take all state by state so if hillary clinton wins texas she's got a slate of
[03:48:06.400 --> 03:48:11.440]  electors from texas who are going to go to the electoral college same thing for the republican
[03:48:11.440 --> 03:48:17.280]  candidate for donald trump okay he's got a slate of trump electors who are going to go there and
[03:48:17.280 --> 03:48:22.480]  and that's what people expect that's what it says in the law that's what it says in the
[03:48:22.480 --> 03:48:28.480]  bylaws of the republican party so the republican party's rules and laws say that the states laws
[03:48:28.480 --> 03:48:35.760]  say that because they paid to run this election for these people and it is nothing but racketeering
[03:48:35.760 --> 03:48:40.960]  and corruption for them to lie to the american people and to say here's our election and then
[03:48:40.960 --> 03:48:46.480]  come around the back door and say but no we had another election and our decision matters more
[03:48:46.480 --> 03:48:50.000]  than your decision that's what we're seeing in the democrat party as well they call up the super
[03:48:50.000 --> 03:48:54.960]  delegates there but now we're seeing that in the republican party now let's talk about brexit
[03:48:54.960 --> 03:49:00.160]  because we got a bunch of whining people who want to break the rules there as well you got the
[03:49:00.160 --> 03:49:07.680]  millennials venting fury at the baby boomers this is a daily mail article they say 72 of the 18 to
[03:49:07.680 --> 03:49:13.680]  24 year olds voted against brexit and of course you've seen if you look at social media you've
[03:49:13.680 --> 03:49:19.920]  seen on twitter and on facebook you've seen the graphic that says uh you know age of the people
[03:49:19.920 --> 03:49:25.920]  and how many of them voted to remain how many of them voted to leave and they say look at the life
[03:49:25.920 --> 03:49:31.520]  and expectancy of these people and they go down they show the older people voted to leave and they
[03:49:31.520 --> 03:49:35.200]  say look at this they don't have to live with this decision that's the young people who have to live
[03:49:35.200 --> 03:49:43.440]  with this decision this is so unfair i want another vote okay well let me say to the young people
[03:49:43.440 --> 03:49:50.240]  out there that the reason the older people voted to leave is because they have lived with that decision
[03:49:51.120 --> 03:49:55.600]  they made that decision the baby boomers did they were part of a generation that made that decision
[03:49:55.600 --> 03:50:02.720]  back in 1975 they said we're not going to leave there was a decision then they voted overwhelmingly
[03:50:02.720 --> 03:50:09.120]  to remain in and again this is a story that i covered on friday uh from the telegraph uh
[03:50:09.120 --> 03:50:16.000]  tem stanley the day the british people defied their jailers and he pointed out he said uh david
[03:50:16.000 --> 03:50:21.760]  cameron only called this in order to hold his own party together once it was called he decided to
[03:50:21.760 --> 03:50:28.800]  turn the british and the global establishment against it out came the treasury the imf even
[03:50:28.800 --> 03:50:35.040]  the president of the united states to argue that britain had to stay this was textbook politics how
[03:50:35.040 --> 03:50:40.960]  things used to be done and it did work back in 1975 when the uk voted overwhelmingly on good advice
[03:50:40.960 --> 03:50:47.120]  to stay in the common market but what have they found now they found that this is not an economic
[03:50:47.120 --> 03:50:53.840]  union it is a political union they found they lost their sovereignty and when they lost their
[03:50:53.840 --> 03:50:59.440]  sovereignty they got a bad deal economically they got a bad deal with everything with immigration
[03:50:59.440 --> 03:51:05.040]  the rest of it stay with us do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain blood pressure

[03:56:30.480 --> 03:56:37.280]  seen it all before there was a referendum back in 1975 in that referendum two-thirds of the voters
[03:56:37.280 --> 03:56:43.840]  voted to stay in the EU within just a few years this is an article from qz.com britain's love
[03:56:43.840 --> 03:56:48.400]  hate relationship with the EU they say within a few years they began tracking public opinion on
[03:56:48.400 --> 03:56:53.840]  the EU and britain they say by 1979 just four years later it became clear that voters have
[03:56:53.840 --> 03:56:59.280]  begun to regret their 1975 decision 60% said they would vote to leave the EU if another
[03:56:59.280 --> 03:57:04.880]  referendum was called while only 32% said they would stay it has only gotten worse since then
[03:57:04.880 --> 03:57:12.720]  and that's the reason why those old geezers voted to ruin your future now they saw what
[03:57:12.720 --> 03:57:19.520]  has happened here they know that the EU has shut down fishermen from fishing in your own waters
[03:57:19.520 --> 03:57:24.480]  they know that they have micromanaged every detail of your life as we pointed out before
[03:57:25.040 --> 03:57:31.040]  they know that it isn't an issue of racism it isn't an issue of an economic leap into darkness
[03:57:31.040 --> 03:57:38.160]  it is an issue of sovereignty if you give up control of your life your political control
[03:57:38.880 --> 03:57:46.240]  then that is not a leap into darkness you are marching into a known economic oblivion
[03:57:46.240 --> 03:57:50.480]  because these people will control your economy it's precisely what we're looking at with the
[03:57:50.480 --> 03:57:55.120]  trans-pacific and the transatlantic partnerships you're going to have people who are unelected
[03:57:55.120 --> 03:58:00.160]  who are going to be controlling every aspect of your economy that's called sovereignty
[03:58:00.160 --> 03:58:05.840]  and they're going to do things like open your borders and bring in workers as they export your
[03:58:05.840 --> 03:58:10.640]  jobs to other areas are going to say we're going to favor this country when they manufacture this
[03:58:10.640 --> 03:58:15.600]  good but if you try to do that we're going to shut you down they've seen that they've seen it for
[03:58:15.600 --> 03:58:20.880]  40 years that's why they said we don't want this anymore that's why they said we're getting out
[03:58:20.880 --> 03:58:26.880]  and he says oh no by the way don't call people stupid losers when you don't agree with them
