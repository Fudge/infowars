[00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:06.802]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:18.425]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:00:18.425 --> 00:00:20.846]  Let me just start the broadcast like this.
[00:00:20.846 --> 00:00:28.268]  Democratic Party platform officially calls for prosecuting man-made global warming skeptics.
[00:00:29.787 --> 00:00:36.629]  So we point out that all these UN heads and people are making massive amounts of money off carbon taxes, and it's all a giant scam.
[00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.130]  You point out that the sun is the main driver of climate.
[00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.950]  They want you arrested.
[00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:51.493]  We know the Democrats have been pushing that here, they've been pushing it in Europe, but it doesn't matter that we found their emails that got hacked six years ago showing major universities coordinating with the UN to, quote, hide the decline.
[00:00:52.409 --> 00:01:00.432]  None of that really matters, because they just want to arrest those of us that call them out for being the criminals they are.
[00:01:00.432 --> 00:01:08.335]  And the Communist Chinese have come out and announced incredible internet censorship, including of Western companies that don't submit to their guidelines.
[00:01:08.335 --> 00:01:11.676]  And Reuters and others come out and kind of write about it like it's an okay thing.
[00:01:12.978 --> 00:01:14.839]  Because they don't want to be censored in China.
[00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:27.789]  In the past, as bad as our media has been, they wouldn't join with a communist Chinese government that has mobile execution vans in every city killing political dissidents and executing you if they find out you're a closet Buddhist.
[00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.251]  Who the Buddhist attacked ever?
[00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:36.335]  So, this is what we're dealing with here, is just incredible totalitarianism galloping.
[00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:42.080]  And by the way, we didn't predict accurately what the EU was going to do if there was a pro-
[00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:46.305]  British exit from the Euro.
[00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:47.726]  We knew what they would do.
[00:01:47.726 --> 00:01:58.635]  They would try to trigger clauses that they have, claiming that if you don't have 75% for an exit, you're not allowed to leave.
[00:01:58.635 --> 00:02:03.579]  The UK never got to vote to enter.
[00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.803]  Out of 25 that have entered the EU, only two of them ever had a vote.
[00:02:08.803 --> 00:02:12.186]  Other countries have voted to get out, and when they vote to get out, they're not allowed to get out.
[00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:16.147]  Now, that's called being a prisoner.
[00:02:16.147 --> 00:02:17.788]  England has its own military.
[00:02:17.788 --> 00:02:20.889]  And this is what's incredible about a Zero Hedge story up on InfoWars.com.
[00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.931]  We're going to be covering it in detail.
[00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:27.632]  They themselves say their answer is a new super state.
[00:02:27.632 --> 00:02:30.774]  That's what George Soros called for yesterday.
[00:02:30.774 --> 00:02:36.716]  And they're telling members that haven't left yet, we're abolishing your militaries.
[00:02:36.716 --> 00:02:40.598]  And next is your police, the final phase of occupation.
[00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.512]  EU response to British exit.
[00:02:45.512 --> 00:02:47.853]  The Brexit totalitarian super state.
[00:02:47.853 --> 00:02:51.616]  Kurt Nemo's written a story about it at Infowars.com.
[00:02:51.616 --> 00:02:54.899]  Measure will strip sovereignty of member states.
[00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:56.360]  And the New American's reporting on it.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.322]  Zero Hedge is reporting on it.
[00:02:58.322 --> 00:03:01.424]  It is simply mind-blowing.
[00:03:01.424 --> 00:03:02.605]  And this is what's being said.
[00:03:02.605 --> 00:03:04.547]  I mean, we knew they'd do it.
[00:03:04.547 --> 00:03:09.651]  We knew they'd come out and say, oh, sorry, it wasn't 75% or another member state of your
[00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:22.185]  United Kingdom, Scotland didn't vote to do it, so they can block you, or we're going to hold your bank account money, or we're going to blockade your trade.
[00:03:22.185 --> 00:03:37.592]  Well, Europe is teetering just as bad as the UK is under globalist control, so England should play guts ball with these EU bureaucrats and say, listen you unelected slimes, the only difference between you and Hitler is you're not driving Panzer tanks and don't have Stuka's dive bombing
[00:03:40.854 --> 00:03:47.256]  Krakow in London and Leningrad.
[00:03:47.256 --> 00:04:00.100]  Civil uprising escalates as eight EU nations threaten referendum as the eighth nation joins it and their response is, hey, we're coming with our military.
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.322]  The EU overthrew two and a half years ago Ukraine, an elected government.
[00:04:05.993 --> 00:04:18.441]  Installed right-wing fascists that actually howl Hitler and then they invaded the east so hardcore That's always been Russian held that the Russians begged and seceded And they call that Russian aggression.
[00:04:18.441 --> 00:04:30.269]  Listen, I'm an American I don't have a dog in this fight other than the fact that I don't want to be part of a country that's assigned to NATO in the UN and and and the EU that are running around starting World War three and
[00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:37.853]  And the Russians have come out, Putin came out in a statement and said this is similar to the collapse of the Soviet Union.
[00:04:37.853 --> 00:04:38.934]  And it is.
[00:04:38.934 --> 00:04:49.182]  An unelected, criminal, fatalitarian, socialist, communist, militaristic, power-grabbing, out-of-control organization.
[00:04:49.182 --> 00:04:56.128]  That fits the EU to a T. It fits the old Soviet Union to a T. The EU needs to be destroyed!
[00:05:00.302 --> 00:05:08.872]  Both GOP nominee Donald Trump and leftist investor George Soros have predicted the complete downfall of the European Union, despite Trump being a nationalist and Soros a globalist.
[00:05:08.872 --> 00:05:18.703]  The two billionaires both independently declared that they believe a domino effect has been started by Britain's decision to leave the EU, and the process will be difficult for anyone to stop, as reported by Steve Watson.
[00:05:18.703 --> 00:05:19.564]  Soros said, quote,
[00:05:19.764 --> 00:05:25.469]  Now the catastrophic scenario that many feared has materialized, making the disintegration of the EU practically irreversible.
[00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:34.017]  Trump also predicted a complete breakup of the EU, and also warned that the continent would be completely unrecognizable within 10 years if strict immigration controls are not enacted.
[00:05:34.017 --> 00:05:35.238]  Trump told reporters, quote,
[00:05:41.263 --> 00:05:45.148]  Trump is referring to the resistance Scottish politicians are still giving Brexit.
[00:05:45.148 --> 00:05:47.631]  He continued, stating that, For more news, visit InfoWars.com.
[00:05:47.631 --> 00:05:48.693]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:06:00.109 --> 00:06:01.730]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.230]  You can't survive without it.
[00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.430]  But where do you get it?
[00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:10.412]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.
[00:06:10.412 --> 00:06:16.134]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[00:06:16.334 --> 00:06:33.202]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.
[00:06:33.602 --> 00:06:36.083]  Filter capacity up to 5,000 gallons.
[00:06:36.083 --> 00:06:37.544]  Stainless steel construction.

[00:06:38.584 --> 00:06:39.505]  Low maintenance.
[00:06:39.505 --> 00:06:41.586]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:08.336]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[00:07:08.336 --> 00:07:09.136]  Here's why.
[00:07:09.136 --> 00:07:13.277]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[00:07:13.277 --> 00:07:14.217]  So please listen.
[00:07:14.217 --> 00:07:17.918]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[00:07:17.918 --> 00:07:24.280]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:28.401]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.582]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[00:07:31.582 --> 00:07:33.943]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[00:07:33.943 --> 00:07:38.765]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators.
[00:07:38.765 --> 00:07:45.507]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[00:07:45.507 --> 00:07:47.247]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[00:07:47.247 --> 00:07:48.948]  Go to gridwars.com.
[00:07:48.948 --> 00:07:50.669]  That's gridwars.com.
[00:07:50.669 --> 00:07:54.550]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:56.110]  Go to gridwars.com.
[00:07:56.110 --> 00:07:57.231]  That's gridwars.com.
[00:08:11.281 --> 00:08:20.804]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[00:08:20.804 --> 00:08:23.005]  The story's linked up at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:08:23.005 --> 00:08:26.486]  It's linked up on InfoWars.com as well.
[00:08:26.486 --> 00:08:33.948]  The Daily Caller, Democratic Party platform calls for prosecuting global warming skeptics.
[00:08:33.948 --> 00:08:39.370]  And they have the subsection there and even a video of them talking about how wonderful it's going to be.
[00:08:41.656 --> 00:08:51.658]  That is the criminal persecution of the American people in line with what the UN's been saying they want.
[00:08:51.658 --> 00:09:09.801]  If you come out and expose this criminal world government takeover that is to be funded with at least 100 trillion every decade off of carbon taxes with Hillary Clinton, Al Gore, Bill Clinton, most of the British leadership, Obama, the Rothschilds,
[00:09:11.547 --> 00:09:23.622]  The other classic elitist names, the Soroses, all standing to make billions apiece per year off of all of your carbon activity.
[00:09:24.701 --> 00:09:27.002]  Because they haven't been able to implement this all over the United States.
[00:09:27.002 --> 00:09:37.148]  I see it in Austin, I see it in San Francisco particularly, so-called liberal areas, that means brainwashed cult member, anti-liberal areas, zombie areas, fascist areas, slave areas, where people love being slaves.
[00:09:37.148 --> 00:09:43.331]  They have carbon indulgences on their car, like you're paying it to the Vatican to stay out of hell or something, you know, Cicero, 800 years ago.
[00:09:43.331 --> 00:09:49.294]  And it says, I pay a carbon tax to this private company.
[00:09:49.294 --> 00:09:51.796]  And then they offset what I'm doing, planting trees or whatever.
[00:09:52.813 --> 00:09:55.675]  Of course, it turns out almost all of that's a giant scam as well.
[00:09:55.675 --> 00:10:07.404]  But this is just where you pay for carbon taxes directly to the London and Chicago and Frankfurt mercantiles and the Paris mercantiles for a giant commodities screwjob.
[00:10:07.404 --> 00:10:16.131]  A global commodities tax run and operated by private interest, tax-exempt with diplomatic immunity.
[00:10:16.131 --> 00:10:21.315]  Of course they want to arrest you if you call these criminals.
[00:10:22.569 --> 00:10:24.650]  Simply mind-blowing.
[00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:26.231]  I mean, we told you it was coming.
[00:10:26.231 --> 00:10:30.172]  They have personally said that I should be arrested in major British newspapers.
[00:10:30.172 --> 00:10:32.893]  They say it on a weekly basis about Lord Monckton.
[00:10:32.893 --> 00:10:34.114]  They talk about Mark Moreno.
[00:10:34.114 --> 00:10:39.036]  They actually had wanted signs in Paris when he premiered his film a few months ago there in Paris.
[00:10:39.036 --> 00:10:43.558]  And you're like, oh, they're just joking around.
[00:10:43.558 --> 00:10:46.699]  No, they're not.
[00:10:46.699 --> 00:10:48.760]  You saw what happened in Sacramento.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.821]  Two idiot groups in a fight with each other.
[00:10:52.011 --> 00:10:52.731]  But here's the difference.
[00:10:52.731 --> 00:10:56.814]  At least the neo-Nazis were anti-globalists and understand this country's being captured.
[00:10:56.814 --> 00:11:08.279]  The useful, idiot, racist BAM group, by any means necessary, that's really an anti-white group from my research, they ran around and began beating people with sticks and hitting them over the head.
[00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:15.343]  And so, wow, the white nationalists stabbed them back.
[00:11:15.343 --> 00:11:17.104]  And so I'll tell you who's in the wrong here.
[00:11:17.104 --> 00:11:18.485]  It's the communists.
[00:11:19.773 --> 00:11:22.413]  And by the way, they are so Ford Foundation funded, it is just...
[00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.717]  Ridiculous.
[00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:31.163]  The image of the police, though, in their black uniforms, taking photos of who's stabbing who and who's hitting who.
[00:11:31.163 --> 00:11:33.665]  We're showing that right now on TV for TV viewers.
[00:11:33.665 --> 00:11:35.987]  Please never forget, if you're a new listener, we're not just radio.
[00:11:35.987 --> 00:11:38.249]  We like to add an added dimension of documentation.
[00:11:38.249 --> 00:11:44.454]  Infowars.com forward slash show and the TV stations around the country, cable stations, starting to pick up the show.
[00:11:44.454 --> 00:11:50.579]  I haven't really gone to that phase of launch yet because I've been so busy getting new reporters and adding crew and
[00:11:51.701 --> 00:11:56.531]  But we've got cable station in Houston and some UHF and VHF and cable stations around the country.
[00:11:56.531 --> 00:12:00.079]  It's more than 20 right now, I know, but we're about to do a big push and get hundreds.
[00:12:01.758 --> 00:12:05.661]  A lot of it's also funding, but I'm going to digress from there.
[00:12:05.661 --> 00:12:12.125]  Everybody knows InfoWars is exponentially growing and reaching more people, especially when it comes to the Internet itself.
[00:12:12.125 --> 00:12:22.872]  That's why the federal government bought out by foreign interest isn't just pushing with the Democrats to arrest people that talk about man-made global warming being a tax scam fraud.
[00:12:22.872 --> 00:12:24.853]  They are also coming out
[00:12:26.491 --> 00:12:39.975]  And pushing, taxing by the mile with the magic boxes in the last 14, 15 years or so that magically fell into all the cars manufactured from North America to Europe to Japan to South Korea to China.
[00:12:39.975 --> 00:12:50.619]  Global standardization by accident of little boxes that you pay for as part of the cost of the car to tax you by the mile, but they're also going to keep the gas tax on top of it.
[00:12:52.062 --> 00:12:54.524]  I've been telling you that for 20 years.
[00:12:54.524 --> 00:12:57.806]  It's now started in Europe, it's now started in many states like Oregon.
[00:12:57.806 --> 00:13:07.032]  Now the Washington Post announces the whole East Coast is about to go together in a giant screw job of epic proportions.
[00:13:07.032 --> 00:13:10.615]  And the attack on free speech just accelerates.
[00:13:10.615 --> 00:13:12.156]  But we're going to be looking at all of that.
[00:13:12.156 --> 00:13:19.321]  Speaking of the devil, ABC News reports, here's the headline, UN says more Central Americans headed to US.
[00:13:20.467 --> 00:13:42.268]  And right down in McCallum, Texas, where two of our reporters are today, and are going to be coming on the broadcast, incidentally, where two of our reporters are right now, they just announced, oh yeah, there's hundreds of thousands from Latin America, they just show up, they're illegal, the newscast admits, but then they're just set up at the bus station by the
[00:13:44.161 --> 00:13:54.851]  Border Patrol, and then they get given vouchers, and they get sent to different areas of the country, just released out into the open, but sent to Democratic Party facilities to be set up, put on welfare, give a driver's license.
[00:13:54.851 --> 00:14:00.776]  Remember a flashback about this two years ago, back in June of 2014?
[00:14:00.776 --> 00:14:04.540]  Jakari Jackson and others showed you them admitting all this.
[00:14:06.647 --> 00:14:08.028]  Of course, I can't go to Honduras.
[00:14:08.028 --> 00:14:09.028]  I can't go to Chile.
[00:14:09.028 --> 00:14:11.910]  I can't go to Central or South America and get anything free.
[00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:17.413]  But it's like, oh, it's families with children and their husbands, of course, and others.
[00:14:17.413 --> 00:14:18.954]  70% are children.
[00:14:18.954 --> 00:14:23.396]  And it doesn't matter if Kevin Pagan, emergency management person, thinks it's OK.
[00:14:23.396 --> 00:14:25.537]  It's not.
[00:14:25.537 --> 00:14:28.659]  And no one covered this but Drudge two years ago.
[00:14:28.659 --> 00:14:30.680]  And now it's, oh, the local news.
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:31.920]  Oh, we're just being loving.
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:32.601]  We're helping.
[00:14:33.806 --> 00:14:35.627]  And then, don't forget this headline from a few months ago.
[00:14:35.627 --> 00:14:36.428]  It just ties in.
[00:14:36.428 --> 00:14:43.693]  Obama administration and UN announced global police force to fight extremism in US.
[00:14:43.693 --> 00:14:51.779]  The Strong Cities Initiative, and they're suing Arpaio and others, that if a drunk driver happens to be illegal, he takes him to jail, and that's mean.
[00:14:54.437 --> 00:14:56.938]  So, isn't that just precious?
[00:14:56.938 --> 00:15:00.539]  Isn't that just the cutest thing you've ever seen in your life?
[00:15:00.539 --> 00:15:01.019]  This is it.
[00:15:01.019 --> 00:15:03.480]  People say, oh, the UN doesn't run things.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:05.180]  You know, the US and Europe do.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:23.186]  Yes, the UN is the multinational group with the IMF, the World Bank, the World Trade Organization, where multinational corporations set up boards and then they get governments to consolidate power into unions and then those unions waive their power to dictatorial, unelected, secret corporate boards
[00:15:24.403 --> 00:15:31.487]  And the EU Parliament is admittedly ceremonial, has no power, it's advisory.
[00:15:31.487 --> 00:15:41.132]  And then now the EU announced Sunday, Soros came out and said, quote, we need to have an emergency reconstitution.
[00:15:41.132 --> 00:15:46.375]  First, the EU needs to go down, but then it needs to be reconstituted into a super state.
[00:15:46.375 --> 00:15:46.855]  And guess what?
[00:15:46.855 --> 00:15:48.376]  The proposal is now out.
[00:15:48.376 --> 00:15:52.318]  The Polish newspapers have gotten the proposal from The Hague in the Netherlands.
[00:15:52.318 --> 00:15:53.499]  And guess what it says?
[00:15:55.785 --> 00:16:04.334]  Members that are still in are having their governments dissolved and their militaries dissolved and are going under EU command.
[00:16:04.334 --> 00:16:07.718]  The militaries will still stand but will now have EU commanders.
[00:16:07.718 --> 00:16:13.685]  That's just like when the Germans came into France and let the French Army in place but put their commanders in place.
[00:16:15.179 --> 00:16:16.279]  Because the public went along with it.
[00:16:16.279 --> 00:16:18.120]  They were called the Vichy French.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.842]  And I hammer that because Germany didn't really beat France in two weeks.
[00:16:23.842 --> 00:16:27.443]  They didn't just really run over the Maginot Line and the Blitzkrieg.
[00:16:27.443 --> 00:16:36.506]  They had a deal with almost the entire general staff of the French to take over and turn power over to them and set it up in the south of France and they did.
[00:16:36.506 --> 00:16:38.826]  But that's barely in the history books.
[00:16:38.826 --> 00:16:42.427]  It's an absolute incontrovertible fact.
[00:16:42.427 --> 00:16:43.828]  But that's what globalism is.
[00:16:45.038 --> 00:16:50.120]  Most of war is using your intelligence agencies to buy off foreign governments before you invade.
[00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.662]  That's what they did to Iraq in 1991 and in 2003.
[00:16:54.662 --> 00:17:01.645]  And then they have Panetta, the former head of the CIA, come out when Trump talks about it and go, we didn't pay anybody off in Iraq.
[00:17:01.645 --> 00:17:03.586]  That's ridiculous.
[00:17:03.586 --> 00:17:06.627]  They paid Iraq off upwards of $60 billion, admittedly.
[00:17:11.041 --> 00:17:16.444]  Before, during, and after that so-called invasion in the first year.
[00:17:16.444 --> 00:17:20.385]  That's admitted.
[00:17:20.385 --> 00:17:25.167]  But that's how dumb they think you are.
[00:17:25.167 --> 00:17:26.048]  And that's what they've done here.
[00:17:26.048 --> 00:17:34.532]  They've come in and bought off the government, and we're openly going under world government, and they have an Atlantic Treaty merging the NAU that was signed in secret in 2005 in Baylor,
[00:17:37.412 --> 00:17:43.097]  University in Waco, Texas by Vicente Fox, Paul Martin, and George W. Bush.
[00:17:43.097 --> 00:17:44.138]  And it was even the local paper.
[00:17:44.138 --> 00:17:45.099]  They signed a treaty.
[00:17:45.099 --> 00:17:46.280]  It's secret.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:51.465]  Then we, two years later, they are having the Banff meeting to ratify it in secret.
[00:17:51.465 --> 00:17:52.666]  Judicial Watch sues.
[00:17:52.666 --> 00:17:54.308]  Gets 2,000 plus pages.
[00:17:54.308 --> 00:17:58.612]  I actually read or scanned all 2,000 pages and made the film in-game.
[00:17:58.612 --> 00:18:03.276]  And I show the pages with an admitting stealth integration to world government.
[00:18:05.694 --> 00:18:14.081]  With the goals of the total corporate rule, with the corporations voting, and then having the heads of state agree, executively, to follow it.
[00:18:14.081 --> 00:18:16.102]  And I made the film Endgame.
[00:18:16.102 --> 00:18:17.664]  Talk about sensational.
[00:18:17.664 --> 00:18:18.604]  That's how this works.
[00:18:18.604 --> 00:18:20.326]  That's how the TPP works.
[00:18:20.326 --> 00:18:26.250]  That's how all this works, and it's being done out in the open now.
[00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:31.314]  And their answer is not to hold Europe hostage and plunge their stock market.
[00:18:31.314 --> 00:18:32.716]  They're already plunging the stock market.
[00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:41.154]  Soros is running around saying British exit makes EU disintegration irreversible, but again, on the ashes of it, he wants to build a super state.
[00:18:41.154 --> 00:18:44.016]  So some will say, well then, this is actually a trap, it's a setup.
[00:18:44.016 --> 00:18:44.756]  No, they're opportunists.
[00:18:44.756 --> 00:18:48.518]  When they start losing one angle, they jump to the other side.
[00:18:48.518 --> 00:18:50.119]  They're divide and conquer.
[00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:51.520]  It's full spectrum dominance.
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:55.482]  They fund ISIS and Al Qaeda, they fight ISIS and Al Qaeda.
[00:18:55.482 --> 00:18:59.224]  They fund the Arab Spring, then they fight the Arab Spring.
[00:18:59.224 --> 00:18:59.985]  Order out of chaos.
[00:19:04.602 --> 00:19:18.470]  But why we're winning is we're educating the public that there's really a corporate world shadow government who, by the way, wants you to be impoverished and controlled towards a eugenics phased out soft kill.
[00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.210]  That's not rhetoric.
[00:19:19.210 --> 00:19:19.951]  That's the truth.
[00:19:19.951 --> 00:19:20.871]  You're seeing it all.
[00:19:20.871 --> 00:19:21.632]  Manifest.
[00:19:21.632 --> 00:19:22.472]  Everything I've told you.
[00:19:22.472 --> 00:19:23.833]  Word for word happening.
[00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:25.474]  Because it's a game plan.
[00:19:25.474 --> 00:19:27.275]  Not my opinion.
[00:19:27.275 --> 00:19:29.756]  I wish I could say I just envisioned all this and I was psychic.
[00:19:29.756 --> 00:19:30.357]  That's not the case.
[00:19:31.926 --> 00:19:34.367]  Everybody's got a sixth sense, but it goes beyond that.
[00:19:34.367 --> 00:19:36.548]  You gotta know what you're looking at, historically.
[00:19:36.548 --> 00:19:37.668]  And it's all here!
[00:19:37.668 --> 00:19:40.349]  You just gotta admit it's happening, then we can beat it!
[00:19:40.349 --> 00:19:46.331]  But the good news is, we're admitting world government, we're admitting it's totalitarian, we're admitting it's far removed, illegitimate, and lying.
[00:19:46.331 --> 00:19:50.653]  Once you get to that point, only dictatorship can keep them in place, and those always fall!
[00:19:50.653 --> 00:19:56.755]  And the EU's now announcing a military dicta- They're actually saying, prepare for us to take over your governments!
[00:19:56.755 --> 00:19:58.216]  I mean, this is sensational!
[00:20:00.256 --> 00:20:01.798]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.

[00:24:06.392 --> 00:24:09.776]  It really is dizzying.
[00:24:09.776 --> 00:24:12.839]  Dizzying is the word.
[00:24:12.839 --> 00:24:27.274]  When I sit here every day at night, getting ready, doing research, during the morning, getting ready, doing research, coming in, looking at hundreds of news articles that they've printed off, many of which I haven't seen, trying to just gauge it all,
[00:24:30.956 --> 00:24:46.580]  And then going out and seeing the billboards, and hearing the radio, and seeing the entertainment TV shows, and hearing people talk, and seeing propaganda at every level, and to see people captured in a scientific technotronic technocracy.
[00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:50.800]  That's the elite's name for worldwide scientific dictatorship.
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:54.121]  Just Google, Davos calls for scientific dictatorship.
[00:24:54.121 --> 00:24:57.322]  You'll get articles with them saying that six years ago.
[00:24:59.773 --> 00:25:02.335]  Club of Rome wrote about it in 1963!
[00:25:02.335 --> 00:25:14.305]  I used to go to the microfilm at the UT library and pull this stuff out just to come read it on air and people didn't believe me in 1996, 97, 98.
[00:25:14.305 --> 00:25:21.071]  So I said, I'm going to try to have a webcam that's good enough to show people these newspaper printouts and these documents.
[00:25:22.790 --> 00:25:31.332]  Because back when they thought they had the public in the 60s, man, they were like, we're going to have UN troops on the streets, we're going to take all the guns, we're going to end the family.
[00:25:31.332 --> 00:25:34.873]  This was in the Washington Post.
[00:25:34.873 --> 00:25:38.874]  We're going to have 10 FEMA regions.
[00:25:38.874 --> 00:25:44.955]  I wish I could find that somewhere in my archives, which is a bunch of storage facilities.
[00:25:44.955 --> 00:25:47.955]  Try to consolidate from like seven of them down to three.
[00:25:47.955 --> 00:25:49.876]  And the actual New York Times.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.463]  Actual New York Times.
[00:25:54.463 --> 00:25:58.987]  I had the microfilm of it and then it was Bernadine Smith.
[00:25:58.987 --> 00:26:02.110]  She ran the Second Amendment Foundation out in California.
[00:26:02.110 --> 00:26:08.015]  That lady mailed me the actual New York Times from 1937 with the 10 regions of FEMA.
[00:26:08.015 --> 00:26:09.397]  Folks, they didn't set that up until 1979.
[00:26:09.397 --> 00:26:14.902]  I mean, these people aren't playing around and I'm sitting here
[00:26:16.682 --> 00:26:18.543]  Here's the allegory.
[00:26:18.543 --> 00:26:19.624]  Here's the parable.
[00:26:19.624 --> 00:26:20.385]  Here's the parallel.
[00:26:20.385 --> 00:26:22.906]  Here's the comparison.
[00:26:22.906 --> 00:26:27.849]  It'd be like if I was a police detective and they get a call about a home disturbance.
[00:26:27.849 --> 00:26:31.732]  The police go out there and a guy has killed his wife with a meat cleaver.
[00:26:31.732 --> 00:26:34.213]  They're gonna go ahead and take him into jail.
[00:26:34.213 --> 00:26:40.758]  He's gonna get charged with probably capital murder if it's premeditated.
[00:26:40.758 --> 00:26:41.958]  They go ahead and search the house.
[00:26:41.958 --> 00:26:45.661]  They go down in the basement and they see photos of all these women.
[00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:47.805]  I don't know.
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:14.181]  And I'm sitting here with all the admitted evidence.
[00:27:14.181 --> 00:27:15.581]  I mean, it's out in the open.
[00:27:15.581 --> 00:27:16.942]  The EU is unelected.
[00:27:16.942 --> 00:27:18.042]  I'm going to say it again.
[00:27:18.042 --> 00:27:19.482]  The EU is unelected.
[00:27:19.482 --> 00:27:22.703]  The United Kingdom didn't vote to enter it.
[00:27:22.703 --> 00:27:24.364]  I'm going to cover this in the next segment.
[00:27:24.364 --> 00:27:25.824]  I have the article right here.
[00:27:25.824 --> 00:27:31.506]  It's now threatening to dissolve, and Kurt's article's good, but it just should be.
[00:27:33.874 --> 00:27:34.635]  Bombshell!
[00:27:34.635 --> 00:27:37.437]  EU moves to dissolve member state militaries.
[00:27:37.437 --> 00:27:39.178]  Goes into full coup mode.
[00:27:39.178 --> 00:27:45.383]  Dissolving... I mean, it's like in Star Wars Episode 4, when Governor Tarkin... Can we cue that up?
[00:27:45.383 --> 00:27:47.305]  One of the movie clip sites.
[00:27:47.305 --> 00:27:57.573]  Governor Tarkin walks into the Death Star, and Darth Vader comes walking in, and they're arguing about how to control the local, you know, star systems with the governors.
[00:27:58.484 --> 00:28:03.225]  And with the local councils, and Governor Target says, we're dissolving the regional councils.
[00:28:03.225 --> 00:28:04.466]  He says, that's impossible!
[00:28:04.466 --> 00:28:06.626]  How will the Emperor maintain control?
[00:28:06.626 --> 00:28:15.769]  We're the regional governors, in fear of this battle station, the equivalent of a nuclear weapon.
[00:28:15.769 --> 00:28:24.131]  We actually have them putting out an official memorandum, saying you're not allowed to leave, and we're going to dissolve your militaries.
[00:28:27.912 --> 00:28:31.714]  That's their response to eight member nations saying they're moving for referendum.
[00:28:31.714 --> 00:28:38.218]  Within two days of that, they come out and say, we are preparing to take over your military.
[00:28:38.218 --> 00:28:38.739]  Stand by.
[00:28:38.739 --> 00:28:41.220]  And then the mainstream people go, it's totally normal.
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:43.942]  The EU showed up in the next few months.
[00:28:43.942 --> 00:28:45.043]  Oh, their commander.
[00:28:45.043 --> 00:28:47.284]  Oh, and guess who the EU commanders already are?
[00:28:47.284 --> 00:28:49.986]  NATO.
[00:28:49.986 --> 00:28:55.449]  Where Hitler couldn't succeed, NATO is about to succeed in a total European dictatorship.
[00:28:55.449 --> 00:28:56.090]  And just like
[00:28:57.287 --> 00:28:59.629]  Just like part three.
[00:28:59.629 --> 00:29:06.554]  Just like Russia was in a fight in World War I with the Germans, and World War II and the German globalists run the EU, now here it is again.
[00:29:06.554 --> 00:29:11.078]  They're busy starting a war with the Russians yet again.
[00:29:11.078 --> 00:29:22.626]  With a bunch of war-mongering, weirdo, feminist women running a whole show at our Pentagon and State Department, who've never been in combat, never been in the military, never killed anybody.
[00:29:22.626 --> 00:29:25.549]  And I'm not saying that because they can't commit atrocities and aren't tough.
[00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.809]  Oh, no, no.
[00:29:26.770 --> 00:29:34.253]  It's so dangerous to have people in the positions of starting wars who've never been in a war.
[00:29:34.253 --> 00:29:37.315]  Boy, that spells disaster.
[00:29:37.315 --> 00:29:47.639]  You got a bunch of weird, cocky women with big, giant, 10-carat diamond rings at the State Department talking about murdering Russians in body bags and swaggering around.
[00:29:47.639 --> 00:29:49.400]  That's crazy!
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:50.781]  We're on the march.
[00:29:50.781 --> 00:29:53.322]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.322 --> 00:29:56.023]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.763 --> 00:30:04.184]  Finally, the mainstream media is reporting on what we broke two years ago.
[00:30:04.184 --> 00:30:04.404]  U.S.
[00:30:04.404 --> 00:30:11.825]  Customs and Border Patrol, under pressure from the Obama administration, is purchasing bus tickets for illegals to ship them deeper into the country at taxpayers' expense.
[00:30:11.825 --> 00:30:23.748]  Local news station KRGV is now covering how the McAllen, Texas bus station is used as a transit hub for illegals Obama is bringing into the country, which Infowars.com exclusively broke in 2014 when no one else dared to report on it.
[00:30:23.748 --> 00:30:28.429]  KRGV revealed that over 100 illegals a day are being dropped off at the McAllen station.
[00:30:28.429 --> 00:30:28.629]  And, in 2014,
[00:30:30.009 --> 00:30:36.194]  InfoWars reported on how the Obama administration was ordering the Border Patrol to release illegals they've apprehended after crossing the border.
[00:30:36.194 --> 00:30:45.221]  But, as part of their release, the illegals are transported to the McAllen bus station by Border Patrol agents, who then buy them tickets to go wherever they want to go in the U.S.
[00:30:45.221 --> 00:30:49.064]  So, for example, if the illegals have relatives in Boston, that's where they get to go.
[00:30:49.064 --> 00:30:52.207]  And taxpayers are paying for this illegal smuggling operation.
[00:30:52.207 --> 00:30:56.110]  To find out more about Obama's lawlessness, visit InfoWars.com.
[00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:57.391]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[00:31:00.327 --> 00:31:08.594]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high quality products and fund the info war.
[00:31:08.594 --> 00:31:09.795]  A 360 win.
[00:31:09.795 --> 00:31:16.360]  Number one, when you choose AutoShip before checkout, we give you 10% off on your order at infowarshore.com.
[00:31:16.360 --> 00:31:23.886]  Number two, you're also able to get items that are out of stock when you sign up for AutoShip because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[00:31:24.286 --> 00:31:29.370]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[00:31:29.370 --> 00:31:35.455]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.
[00:31:35.455 --> 00:31:43.261]  Just go to InfoWarsTore.com, select your favorite product or products, click on auto ship, and choose how often you want us to send you another order.
[00:31:43.261 --> 00:31:50.467]  As you know, I coined the term 360 win, and with the new auto ship feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[00:31:50.467 --> 00:31:51.288]  10% off on auto ship.
[00:31:51.428 --> 00:31:53.869]  Win, win, win at Infowarslife.com.
[00:31:53.869 --> 00:31:55.850]  Free shipping on orders above 50 bucks.
[00:31:55.850 --> 00:32:00.212]  And all out of stock items are never out of stock when you sign up for auto ship.
[00:32:00.212 --> 00:32:01.133]  Shower filters.
[00:32:01.133 --> 00:32:02.734]  We're introducing the best yet.
[00:32:02.734 --> 00:32:06.936]  The brand new ProPure ProMax high performance shower filter.
[00:32:06.936 --> 00:32:11.738]  It removes and reduces over 200 contaminants while preserving a strong, powerful flow.
[00:32:11.738 --> 00:32:18.822]  This new four stage filtration process helps protect the largest organ in your body, your skin, from the unhealthy contaminants in the water.
[00:32:18.822 --> 00:32:20.983]  You can find more details on this amazing new filter
[00:32:21.323 --> 00:32:29.927]  Free shipping at InfowarsStore.com or call 888-253-3139 to order your ProMax shower filter from ProPure today.
[00:32:29.927 --> 00:32:33.448]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[00:32:33.448 --> 00:32:38.490]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors
[00:32:38.610 --> 00:32:39.011]  We're good.
[00:33:13.323 --> 00:33:21.787]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[00:33:21.787 --> 00:33:26.129]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[00:33:26.129 --> 00:33:30.331]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[00:33:30.331 --> 00:33:32.411]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:32.411 --> 00:33:37.794]  Take the children and yourself and hide out in the cellar.
[00:33:40.678 --> 00:33:51.407]  Lord Monckton is not just the champion globally exposing man-made global warming and the carbon tax as a world government totalitarian fraud and taxation scam.
[00:33:51.407 --> 00:34:01.696]  He is undoubtedly the chief long-term resistor of the EU dictatorship.
[00:34:01.696 --> 00:34:06.020]  You can say that Nigel Farage is now the leader of the
[00:34:08.695 --> 00:34:12.398]  Anti-EU tyranny movement.
[00:34:12.398 --> 00:34:21.123]  And what's so exciting about this is they only began to be Eurosceptics Moncton 30-something years ago, but Farage 25 years ago.
[00:34:21.123 --> 00:34:29.589]  They've only been really politically active 20 and they've already are the fastest growing party not just in the UK but Europe and just had one of the biggest political victories for sovereignty.
[00:34:30.845 --> 00:34:34.968]  And what this is going to lead to is the equivalent of the Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776.
[00:34:34.968 --> 00:34:43.193]  The will to do this, having the leadership, being in the right, will win the war.
[00:34:43.193 --> 00:34:44.634]  We're in the right, we can't lose.
[00:34:44.634 --> 00:34:51.679]  And this is as big as 1776, in the whole chain of Magna Carta, 1776, this event.
[00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:54.020]  And I'm not just saying that.
[00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.782]  Even the globalists are saying this is one of the biggest events in history.
[00:34:58.612 --> 00:35:01.815]  We're going to explain why, but we knew this was coming.
[00:35:01.815 --> 00:35:06.499]  As soon as I saw this this morning, I went, oh my God, Lord Monckton has hammered this over and over again.
[00:35:06.499 --> 00:35:09.962]  A plan to get rid of nation state armies.
[00:35:09.962 --> 00:35:21.792]  Kurt Neumann wrote a story where the Polish papers have gotten the EU plan in their, quote, emergency reorganization for a, quote, super state to now tell countries before they can leave, we're just going to take your military over.
[00:35:21.792 --> 00:35:22.132]  Why not?
[00:35:22.132 --> 00:35:25.015]  They already make all the laws and aren't elected.
[00:35:25.015 --> 00:35:25.235]  And then?
[00:35:27.253 --> 00:35:29.916]  One of our writers put this report out.
[00:35:29.916 --> 00:35:33.280]  June 23rd, Kit Daniels ran in and brought it to my attention.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:35.082]  He said, Alex, we wrote about this last week.
[00:35:35.082 --> 00:35:39.247]  Proposed EU army hidden from British voters until after Brexit.
[00:35:39.247 --> 00:35:42.932]  EU army proposal to remain hidden from British voters until day after Brexit vote.
[00:35:42.932 --> 00:35:44.373]  This was the day before the vote.
[00:35:45.074 --> 00:35:46.815]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is so unprecedented.
[00:35:46.815 --> 00:35:51.398]  When I'm reading the actual EU proposal, I can't believe it.
[00:35:51.398 --> 00:35:55.441]  It's like seeing Hitler invade France, or Czechoslovakia, or Poland.
[00:35:55.441 --> 00:36:00.284]  I mean, if you were alive at that time, you're seeing it unfold.
[00:36:00.284 --> 00:36:01.965]  And I just don't know what to say at this point.
[00:36:01.965 --> 00:36:05.287]  I mean, I know they're criminals, I know they're tyrannical, but my God.
[00:36:05.287 --> 00:36:06.988]  Oh, eight countries want to leave?
[00:36:06.988 --> 00:36:08.369]  We're taking over your militaries!
[00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:11.050]  What?
[00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.513]  I mean, we're going to arrest Germans that criticize open borders.
[00:36:14.513 --> 00:36:15.254]  We're going to arrest Swedes.
[00:36:15.254 --> 00:36:16.755]  We're going to Lord Monckton in just a moment.
[00:36:16.755 --> 00:36:19.077]  I'm not going to belabor this, but we're listener-supported.
[00:36:19.077 --> 00:36:20.578]  We're not sponsor-supported.
[00:36:20.578 --> 00:36:22.480]  80% is listener.
[00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:26.404]  We don't just have the very best products at some of the lowest prices out there.
[00:36:26.404 --> 00:36:28.886]  We are the tip of the spear worldwide in full wars.
[00:36:31.135 --> 00:36:35.497]  He is reaching the most people when it comes to fighting the New World Order.
[00:36:35.497 --> 00:36:39.838]  Drudge overall reaches a lot more people in general, and he's fighting them as well, doing a great job.
[00:36:39.838 --> 00:36:43.300]  I'm not here bragging, hey, we're one of the biggest ships in this fight.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:45.360]  I don't like being the main target.
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:48.402]  I can tell you right now, I want to see other people come on the stage.
[00:36:48.402 --> 00:36:56.325]  But look, the Democratic platform now officially calls to pass laws to arrest climate change deniers.
[00:36:56.325 --> 00:36:58.165]  That is Daily Caller in it today.
[00:36:58.165 --> 00:36:59.446]  That's now in the platform.
[00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:04.034]  They're wanting to arrest this man every day in the newspapers.
[00:37:04.034 --> 00:37:04.554]  Lord Monckton.
[00:37:04.554 --> 00:37:05.455]  They're coming for us.
[00:37:05.455 --> 00:37:07.578]  And people say, well, we better give up.
[00:37:07.578 --> 00:37:13.484]  No, when they hang up signs in Paris saying, arrest Mark Moreno for his film, that's a badge of honor.
[00:37:13.484 --> 00:37:16.647]  When communists show up and stab people, that's a badge of honor, like they did.
[00:37:16.647 --> 00:37:18.409]  This is the... They're making their move.
[00:37:18.409 --> 00:37:19.490]  We're going to go to Lord Monckton in a moment.
[00:37:20.757 --> 00:37:23.640]  All I'm saying is, we have the Hillary for Prison shirts.
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:25.322]  They sold out faster than I thought.
[00:37:25.322 --> 00:37:27.584]  Version 2, the collector's edition.
[00:37:27.584 --> 00:37:29.706]  We've got smalls and XXLs, and they're gone.
[00:37:29.706 --> 00:37:30.827]  There's a few hundred left.
[00:37:30.827 --> 00:37:31.728]  They're gonna be gone.
[00:37:31.728 --> 00:37:34.731]  An 18-wheeler shows up, made right here in America, Wednesday.
[00:37:36.371 --> 00:37:41.053]  Of course, we sold out because they're 75% off when you buy a second shirt, 50% off when you buy one.
[00:37:41.053 --> 00:37:42.954]  They're at cost at $5.
[00:37:42.954 --> 00:37:47.056]  That's 75% off what they normally are.
[00:37:47.056 --> 00:37:51.399]  So if you want to get those, unfortunately, the three best-selling sizes are sold out.
[00:37:51.399 --> 00:37:53.140]  We'll get more of the new design in.
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:55.581]  It's very similar in a few days.
[00:37:56.361 --> 00:37:58.083]  Now, that doesn't really fund the operation.
[00:37:58.083 --> 00:38:03.267]  What funds the operation is the water filtration systems everybody needs at InfoWartStore.com.
[00:38:03.267 --> 00:38:04.949]  10% off promo code water.
[00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:07.391]  Nobody should be drinking the tap water.
[00:38:07.391 --> 00:38:08.592]  It's contaminated everywhere.
[00:38:08.592 --> 00:38:10.273]  It's one of the biggest causes of cancer.
[00:38:10.273 --> 00:38:11.354]  Look it up for yourself.
[00:38:11.354 --> 00:38:15.057]  We have the very best spectrum of about eight different brands that I use personally.
[00:38:15.057 --> 00:38:18.360]  Shower filters, the ProMax, the AlexaPures, all of them.
[00:38:19.645 --> 00:38:22.827]  10% off promo code water on all those systems.
[00:38:22.827 --> 00:38:27.909]  And we have the Rolls-Royce of deep cleansing back in stock.
[00:38:27.909 --> 00:38:35.634]  One of our best-selling products, but it's very hard to source these and have them at California standards, which are basically almost impossible to pass, but we've done it again.
[00:38:35.634 --> 00:38:38.155]  And we have 20% off deep cleanse.
[00:38:38.155 --> 00:38:39.636]  That's only running for two more days.
[00:38:40.336 --> 00:38:51.170]  It's got concentrated zeolites, organic cilantro, organic milk thistle, fulvic acid, and many other cleansing ingredients, phylogy, you name it, that are known to pull toxins out of the body.
[00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:54.735]  Infowarslife.com, infowarsstore.com.
[00:38:56.189 --> 00:38:58.930]  But this is such an incredible juncture.
[00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:09.855]  You see our reporters about to be, well they're actually in the valley now where they admit the UN is running a program bringing refugees in from Latin America with no background check, with TB, and they've been on the news.
[00:39:09.855 --> 00:39:10.496]  They're illegal?
[00:39:10.496 --> 00:39:14.477]  They're loaded on buses and shipped to Democratic Party facilities around the country to be given ID cards.
[00:39:14.477 --> 00:39:16.799]  That's on ABC News like it's a good thing.
[00:39:16.799 --> 00:39:19.680]  I mean, what you see in Europe is happening here by stealth.
[00:39:21.044 --> 00:39:25.786]  So, our reporters are down there, our reporters are at Bilderberg, our reporters are out in California when folks are being attacked.
[00:39:25.786 --> 00:39:26.606]  I mean, they're everywhere.
[00:39:26.606 --> 00:39:31.648]  We're building a true news organization, and it's your support and spreading the word that's doing it.
[00:39:31.648 --> 00:39:33.429]  So, censorship's coming in.
[00:39:33.429 --> 00:39:35.890]  They're trying to hand the Internet over to the UN right now.
[00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:43.533]  Even though the United States and England, as usual, built it, they are handing it over to the UN and the EU right now.
[00:39:43.533 --> 00:39:45.174]  I mean, that's in the Associated Press.
[00:39:47.239 --> 00:39:49.924]  Internet being handed over to globalists.
[00:39:49.924 --> 00:39:52.809]  I mean, see, the move is happening now.
[00:39:52.809 --> 00:39:55.033]  Now, I'm going to give Lord Moxon the floor until we end this hour.
[00:39:55.033 --> 00:39:58.560]  I appreciate him coming on on very, very short notice.
[00:39:59.844 --> 00:40:06.710]  His website is scienceandpublicpolicy.org and he's published many of the top peer-reviewed papers in the world.
[00:40:06.710 --> 00:40:11.435]  Some of the top read, in fact the top read paper on climate change in the world is his paper.
[00:40:11.435 --> 00:40:15.699]  That's subscribed to by tens of thousands and they want to arrest him for that.
[00:40:15.699 --> 00:40:16.780]  That is in the news today.
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:17.601]  So a true
[00:40:19.013 --> 00:40:34.906]  He doesn't want to hear that, but we need to recognize that the George Washingtons of our time, and they're people like Nigel Farage, they're people like, and you can talk about other folks in England that fought tyranny, and expanding on that, you see Trump coming out.
[00:40:34.906 --> 00:40:37.848]  Trump, Farage, 2016 a lot of folks are saying.
[00:40:37.848 --> 00:40:39.670]  Globally, just as leadership.
[00:40:40.487 --> 00:40:44.209]  And our countries and our nations and our shared histories coming back together.
[00:40:44.209 --> 00:40:45.750]  Something the globalists hate.
[00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:47.710]  Our national flags coming back out.
[00:40:47.710 --> 00:40:49.371]  Political correctness under attack.
[00:40:49.371 --> 00:40:50.952]  This is just a great time.
[00:40:50.952 --> 00:40:55.234]  But they're counter striking with the most totalitarian garbage I've ever seen.
[00:40:55.234 --> 00:41:02.818]  And it is now here, the EU, if you just joined us, openly announcing that they're going to go into member states and take over their militaries and not let them leave.
[00:41:02.818 --> 00:41:04.518]  They're using the word super state.
[00:41:04.518 --> 00:41:05.959]  Lord Monckton, you predicted it.
[00:41:05.959 --> 00:41:07.320]  It's now documented.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.600]  I am faint of breath.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.461]  I mean, I quite frankly
[00:41:11.174 --> 00:41:13.441]  I don't get butterflies when I'm speaking to a crowd of 10,000 people.
[00:41:13.441 --> 00:41:17.555]  I have butterflies right now because I just feel the history is happening.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:28.242]  History was indeed made by the British people on the 23rd of June, which is already being called Independence Day here in the UK.
[00:41:28.242 --> 00:41:40.664]  And you might like to know, Alex, that the film, Independence Day Resurgence, was very carefully timed so that it premiered in the UK on the 23rd of June, and I've already seen it.
[00:41:40.664 --> 00:41:44.945]  So, there is a great movement afoot now of ordinary people
[00:41:45.465 --> 00:42:11.196]  The moment they get the chance to have their say, and governments in Britain have been trying for decades to deny them the chance to have their say, and in the end it was Nigel Farage, to whom you've quite correctly paid tribute, it was he who for decades has been at the front line battling this, he who transformed UKIP into a useful fighting machine, he who terrified David Cameron so much before the last election,
[00:42:11.676 --> 00:42:27.627]  That Cameron promised us a referendum in the hope of getting just enough votes to win, which he got, but then he had to hold the referendum he promised and he couldn't win that because the British people have spoken and they've spoken decisively enough.
[00:42:27.627 --> 00:42:32.471]  52% to 48% and as our former Prime Minister William Pitt said,
[00:42:33.291 --> 00:42:43.618]  And he said this just after we'd won the Napoleonic War, a previous victory against an overmighty totalitarian... I almost mentioned Pitt when I was talking about British-style George Washingtons.
[00:42:43.618 --> 00:42:44.619]  Go ahead.
[00:42:44.619 --> 00:42:50.823]  Well, let's give the quote that he gave in his speech to the Mansion House dinner.
[00:42:51.783 --> 00:42:56.986]  Just before his death, it was the last speech he made, it was his shortest and his most eloquent.
[00:42:56.986 --> 00:43:06.070]  All he said was, England has saved herself by her exertions and will, as I trust, save Europe by her example.
[00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:18.476]  And I think we are now seen very widely throughout Europe as being the voice of reason and sense and liberty against this increasingly cloying and increasingly aggressive
[00:43:19.116 --> 00:43:21.918]  Totalitarian EU.
[00:43:21.918 --> 00:43:48.019]  And of course the left, which are totalitarian by instinct and by their belief, they welcome the idea that the likes of you and me, Alex, should be locked up for pointing out that the world is not getting warmer at anything like the rate that the left had predicted, that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, effectively a communist organisation, they predicted a rate of warming that simply hasn't come to pass.
[00:43:48.019 --> 00:43:48.780]  It's not happening.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:44:10.034]  So now, here we have a proposal, again, from the left in the EU, this time to bring forward the proposal for a so-called EU army, by which they make all the armies of the member states into one army, commanded, of course, by the unelected commissars, not answerable to any elected parliament.
[00:44:10.134 --> 00:44:15.038]  So people start saying you're taking over, you're arresting people, you're not letting them have speech, you're tax-exempt.
[00:44:15.038 --> 00:44:17.139]  Their answer is, we're going to take your army over.
[00:44:17.139 --> 00:44:19.241]  I mean, that's true occupation, is it not?
[00:44:19.241 --> 00:44:20.261]  Well, it is indeed.
[00:44:20.261 --> 00:44:25.685]  And what we have got here is now a gallop towards formal dictatorship.
[00:44:25.685 --> 00:44:32.670]  And the question is whether there are still enough independent-minded media around to speak out.
[00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:37.174]  You won't hear a word of criticism of this on the BBC, for instance.
[00:44:37.814 --> 00:44:40.755]  And this is a big problem, the media are being captured by these people.
[00:44:40.755 --> 00:44:46.897]  Let me ask you this, because you've worked in media, you've been a top newspaper editor, top advisor to Margaret Thatcher.
[00:44:46.897 --> 00:44:53.378]  This is really a dictatorship openly announcing itself, not since Hitler invaded, in my view, have we seen a threat this serious.
[00:44:53.378 --> 00:44:57.580]  Not even the Soviet Union, because people knew that's an outside group, it didn't have much of a chance.
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:58.660]  But specifically,
[00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:05.764]  The arrogance, the boldness of the left, the radical islamicists, these imams that call for violence supporting the EU.
[00:45:05.764 --> 00:45:09.547]  I mean, it's really just a crew of motley trash.
[00:45:10.774 --> 00:45:20.956]  Well, what has happened is that the governing class worldwide, the classe politique as the French call it, they have been making common totalitarian cause.
[00:45:20.956 --> 00:45:29.958]  You've got the two kinds of totalitarianism, the corporatists who like to be involved with big business and get big business to go along with them, those are the fascists.
[00:45:29.958 --> 00:45:37.019]  Then you've got the communists, the open collectivists, and that they're now finding common cause for the first time.
[00:45:37.019 --> 00:45:38.440]  They battled each other in the 20th century.
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:43.862]  But now, they are standing together against liberty.
[00:45:43.862 --> 00:45:47.604]  And that's the significance of this European army move.
[00:45:47.604 --> 00:45:49.426]  It's that they're so desperate.
[00:45:49.426 --> 00:45:53.668]  They know that the peoples of Europe do not love them.
[00:45:53.668 --> 00:46:00.672]  They know that they have failed to deliver what we would regard as useful European government.
[00:46:01.312 --> 00:46:12.159]  So they are now panicking and saying, how can we cling by the fingernails to this empire of bureaucracy that we have created, even though it's hated by the peoples of Europe?
[00:46:12.159 --> 00:46:18.363]  And the answer, of course, is to get the governing elites of Europe to join together, just as they did in trying to bully us.
[00:46:18.943 --> 00:46:23.307]  ...into voting for staying in the European Union, and that failed.
[00:46:23.307 --> 00:46:25.989]  So now they're going to do it by force.
[00:46:25.989 --> 00:46:44.824]  Just as in the United States, as you rightly point out, there's a growing movement, and it's now almost official part of the democratic platform, that anybody who actually comes out and says, hang on a moment, there are serious scientific problems with this climate change nonsense, can be arrested and detained and put on trial for that.
[00:46:44.824 --> 00:46:46.005]  But here's the difficulty.
[00:46:46.625 --> 00:46:57.478]  For as long as they're still talking about putting people on trial, there is at least the chance that you might get a fair trial, because the great thing about a trial is that both sides are heard.
[00:46:57.478 --> 00:47:00.281]  The danger with the European Army proposal...
[00:47:01.278 --> 00:47:09.708]  Is that there is no court to whom anyone in Europe can appeal if their governing class decides to go down this route.
[00:47:09.708 --> 00:47:19.120]  Because then that common European army will be established and let us be quite clear, its aim is not to do what NATO does, to protect
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:28.562]  The member states of NATO so that if any one of those states is invading... Its aim is to keep countries within the system, they admit.
[00:47:28.562 --> 00:47:42.385]  This is an internal army designed to suppress the will of the people and keep them cowering in fear and to kick down the door just like the KGB if the people disagree with them.
[00:47:42.825 --> 00:47:45.148]  That is what the European Army is about.
[00:47:45.148 --> 00:47:50.175]  That's why they want a European Army as well as NATO.
[00:47:50.175 --> 00:47:53.599]  Because NATO already deals with the external defence of Europe.
[00:47:53.599 --> 00:47:58.165]  It's NATO that's kept the peace and kept the Russians and everybody else at bay.
[00:47:59.266 --> 00:48:02.489]  So why do they need a European army as well as NATO?
[00:48:02.489 --> 00:48:10.515]  Answer, because NATO is explicitly forbidden to police the internal affairs of member states.
[00:48:10.515 --> 00:48:20.844]  And member states contribute to NATO, it's not commanded by NATO itself, so it goes back to the more republic strategy, but in a military coalition, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
[00:48:20.844 --> 00:48:23.526]  Now Lord Monckton, we're going to skip this, we have more time.
[00:48:23.526 --> 00:48:26.989]  I wanted to get Kit Daniels briefly, one of our writers that's been writing about this,
[00:48:28.090 --> 00:48:40.191]  And we have another writer, Clifford Cunningham, who wrote about this last week, proposed EU army hidden from British voters until after Brexit, and then right after they bring it out, just showing the amazing stealth of this.
[00:48:40.191 --> 00:48:40.671]  Kit Daniels?
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:42.361]  Yes, Alex.
[00:48:42.361 --> 00:48:50.667]  Yesterday, it was on Thursday I believe, I posted this article from our new guy Clifford Cunningham, and now this is before Brexit even happened.
[00:48:50.667 --> 00:49:01.936]  He said that as citizens of the United Kingdom are prepared to cast their votes in a nationwide referendum to decide whether or not to leave the European Union, a plan detailing the initial framework of the creation of the EU army
[00:49:02.396 --> 00:49:05.779]  Is being kept hidden from the public until the day after the vote.
[00:49:05.779 --> 00:49:13.745]  So now the EU bureaucrats are claiming that this whole EU army program is a response to Brexit, but this proves that it was not at all.
[00:49:13.745 --> 00:49:16.167]  They had this plan for months.
[00:49:16.167 --> 00:49:23.914]  But that, exactly, but I mean isn't it even more outrageous, Lord Monks, and then going back to Kip briefly, Daniels, that their answer is
[00:49:25.501 --> 00:49:26.482]  We're not going to let you leave.
[00:49:26.482 --> 00:49:30.405]  I mean, I'm reading the draft of it and it says we're going to keep you in.
[00:49:30.405 --> 00:49:32.126]  We're one shared common group.
[00:49:32.126 --> 00:49:34.068]  Basically, we're going to make it harder for you to leave.
[00:49:34.068 --> 00:49:37.611]  They're admitting that, hey, you didn't get to vote to enter this.
[00:49:37.611 --> 00:49:39.913]  We're unelected and we're going to let you leave.
[00:49:39.913 --> 00:49:55.225]  Now, this this European army idea has in fact been kicking around for a long time and it's been gathering dust, but also gathering momentum among the totalitarian left because they, since the fall of fascism and communism, the left have not had
[00:49:55.265 --> 00:50:04.512]  They had armies like that of Hitler and of Stalin at their disposal, and so they want, they realise now, they cannot out-argue us.
[00:50:04.512 --> 00:50:08.335]  They cannot speak against democracy and expect to be heard by democracy.
[00:50:08.335 --> 00:50:09.556]  They tried that.
[00:50:09.556 --> 00:50:17.903]  And even with all the elite backing only one side of the vote, it's the other side, the democratic side, that carried the day in Britain.
[00:50:18.363 --> 00:50:24.211]  So now, although I was born in a democracy, I do not live in one, I shall die in one.
[00:50:24.211 --> 00:50:26.194]  So the British people have won that.
[00:50:26.194 --> 00:50:34.626]  But the response, it's not a response to Brexit, this European army plan, it's been around for actually at least 15 years.
[00:50:34.626 --> 00:50:35.127]  It's amazing.
[00:50:35.407 --> 00:50:37.789]  Gathering momentum all that time.
[00:50:37.789 --> 00:50:51.222]  And as I say, the significance of this European army and the fact that only now are they admitting the latest stage in its development, as they knew perfectly well, that there would be an even larger negative vote against the EU if this came out in public.
[00:50:51.222 --> 00:50:54.725]  This just shows how little they care for how ordinary people think.
[00:50:57.767 --> 00:51:02.531]  I want to go back to you in a moment, but I want to have Kip be able to chime back in one more time because he's been on this beat writing about it.
[00:51:02.531 --> 00:51:05.012]  But then I want to ask you, Monkton, so ruminate on this for about a minute.
[00:51:06.112 --> 00:51:09.354]  You've told us which shoe was going to drop next, years before it happened.
[00:51:09.354 --> 00:51:14.516]  Please tell us what you expect from the EU next, what their scams are going to be, how we counter this.
[00:51:14.516 --> 00:51:31.304]  And do you agree with me that, regardless, it's one of the biggest victories in modern history against totalitarianism, because we forced the fact that, yes, we don't get to vote, you're unelected, world government's now out in the open, we've got world leaders like Donald Trump and Nigel Farage talking about mega banks.
[00:51:31.304 --> 00:51:32.885]  I mean, it seems to me this is just
[00:51:34.046 --> 00:51:45.200]  Absolutely devastating events that in the end will sink these people, but just like Hitler didn't know he was beaten at Leningrad or at the Battle of the Bulge and the Ardennes, they're still going to fight on for a while.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.404]  So I want to get your take, Lord Monckton, in just a moment.
[00:51:48.404 --> 00:51:49.646]  Finishing up, Kit, other points.
[00:51:49.966 --> 00:51:51.768]  Yeah, I'm working on an article right now, Alex.
[00:51:51.768 --> 00:52:05.039]  I saw CNN yesterday, and they brought in a former ambassador, Christopher Hill, who said, quote, the only way to make Europe more than the sum of member state diplomacies is to make it into a real state.
[00:52:05.039 --> 00:52:12.606]  Multilevel governance may be just about satisfactory for managing mountains of butter, but is barely suitable for making decisions about guns.
[00:52:12.606 --> 00:52:17.230]  And CNN brought this guy on as a, quote, interview, but it's a little more than a propaganda piece.
[00:52:18.021 --> 00:52:22.529]  Let me respond to that and I'll get Lord Monk in response to my three questions if he can remember them.
[00:52:22.529 --> 00:52:23.871]  Look, again...
[00:52:25.034 --> 00:52:31.276]  You look at the EU, it's always been there to destroy the nation states, get them into debt and then fold them into the super state.
[00:52:31.276 --> 00:52:32.856]  They wrote about that 50 years ago.
[00:52:32.856 --> 00:52:36.577]  So their conspiracy is public to those that are learned.
[00:52:36.577 --> 00:52:37.417]  It's not debatable.
[00:52:37.417 --> 00:52:43.099]  The problem is the general public now begins to understand that this is a wicked organization.
[00:52:43.099 --> 00:52:47.960]  But how do we take them to the next level to understand it's always been premeditated?
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:48.500]  Lord Monckton.
[00:52:49.735 --> 00:53:09.564]  The first thing to do is to understand that this has now become, it didn't start as a premeditated attempt to take away democracy, but it has rapidly become exactly that, as the people who are behind all this realised how feeble the response of nation states would be when they needed to defend themselves.
[00:53:10.104 --> 00:53:22.096]  And already what is happening as a result of this vote is that there are about three and a half to four million signatures on a petition demanding there should be a rerun of the referendum in Britain because they don't like the result.
[00:53:22.096 --> 00:53:29.504]  It'll be just like Denmark and Ireland where they were made to vote again and vote again until they got the result that the governing class wanted.
[00:53:29.944 --> 00:53:33.285]  And only then was that referendum regarded as final.
[00:53:33.285 --> 00:53:37.547]  The same thing is now being attempted even with the British people.
[00:53:37.547 --> 00:53:40.348]  And I can tell you we're not going to like that very much.
[00:53:40.348 --> 00:53:50.172]  We are going to oppose this very vigorously the more the governing establishment tries to discredit and dishonour and not to implement that referendum.
[00:53:50.652 --> 00:54:06.628]  The more strongly the support for freedom will grow among ordinary people, and eventually the Conservative Party, which is deeply divided on this, and half of which still wishes that it could overturn this referendum and simply carry on as though it hadn't happened.
[00:54:06.628 --> 00:54:11.753]  You've got the whole of the Labour Party, which is effectively communist under its present leader, Jeremy Corbyn.
[00:54:12.333 --> 00:54:22.577]  Now in disarray, but the disarray is mainly due to an argument about how far they should push a reversal of the people's will.
[00:54:22.577 --> 00:54:29.280]  How far they should oppose the parliamentary bill that will be necessary to break us free of Europe.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.021]  The referendum on its own doesn't do it.
[00:54:31.021 --> 00:54:32.922]  Parliament then has to do the people's will.
[00:54:33.642 --> 00:54:49.698]  And with the likes of the Labour Party and the Scottish National Workers' Party, all these parties that are left-wing, the so-called Liberal, so-called Democrats, who are neither, the so-called Greens, who are the destroyers of the planet, these people, they're all on the far left from
[00:54:49.858 --> 00:55:07.365]  I understand, but long term... They are going to fight and fight and fight to make sure that they will use the majority that they can muster in parliament, together with a whole lot of conservatives who aren't really conservative at all, to vote down any bill to give effect... So that's their next scam.
[00:55:07.365 --> 00:55:08.686]  Let me ask you this then.
[00:55:08.686 --> 00:55:10.247]  That's going to be the next battle.
[00:55:10.247 --> 00:55:11.127]  Sure.
[00:55:11.127 --> 00:55:13.468]  I mean, just brief questions here fast, because I want your view on this.
[00:55:14.861 --> 00:55:24.747]  But do you agree with me, though, that the genie's out of the bottle, it's gonna be a long fight, but there's no way, I mean, unless it's a total dictatorship, is there ever gonna be able to keep this thing in place?
[00:55:24.747 --> 00:55:26.808]  How long until you think Europe finally falls apart?
[00:55:27.728 --> 00:55:29.789]  The people have spoken here in Britain.
[00:55:29.789 --> 00:55:32.831]  They haven't been allowed to speak almost everywhere else.
[00:55:32.831 --> 00:55:40.216]  Where they have been allowed to speak, they have tended to be told to go and vote again and vote again until they get the answer the elites want.
[00:55:40.216 --> 00:55:42.938]  That technique will no longer work.
[00:55:42.938 --> 00:55:50.563]  There is now a need for something I've mentioned before, which is an international grouping to advance the cause of liberty.
[00:55:50.563 --> 00:55:55.326]  No longer, if we stand alone as national parties, will we be strong enough to defeat...
[00:55:58.209 --> 00:56:08.018]  You've talked about an open society of governments and peoples working together in shared cause so that the globalists just don't act like they're the only ones trying to have humanity come together.
[00:56:08.018 --> 00:56:09.299]  Why have we given them that power?
[00:56:09.299 --> 00:56:10.761]  We need something to counter that.
[00:56:11.738 --> 00:56:12.238]  We do.
[00:56:12.238 --> 00:56:29.368]  We now need a Freedom International, I don't know what we'll call it, but something like that, which is a subscription membership party, which everybody joins, from America, from Britain, from all the other countries of Europe and the Commonwealth and everywhere else, where liberty still matters.
[00:56:29.368 --> 00:56:35.672]  Because if we don't stand together now, then we'll fall, as I think it was Benjamin Franklin used to say.
[00:56:35.672 --> 00:56:36.512]  We'll hang separate.
[00:56:36.512 --> 00:56:39.474]  We must all hang together, or assuredly we shall all hang separately.
[00:56:40.194 --> 00:56:59.841]  Listen, I mean, Nigel Farage, I mean, I cannot stress, and yourself and the rest of the party, UKIP, coming from nowhere, now the fastest growing party in Europe, other parties joining, other parties picking up the nationalist rhetoric, this is beautiful, Le Pen, all the rest of it, I mean, this is clearly rising, and globally, this could bring in the new renaissance.
[00:57:00.581 --> 00:57:03.883]  Remember that this is not a nationalist movement, UKIP.
[00:57:03.883 --> 00:57:08.526]  What UKIP is, is a democratic, freedom-loving movement.
[00:57:08.526 --> 00:57:13.528]  We are not there to say a nation-state is the only way we can conduct our affairs.
[00:57:13.528 --> 00:57:23.294]  We are there to say that a European super-state that we do not elect and that our people cannot control, that is not the way forward for Europe any more than it is for our country.
[00:57:23.294 --> 00:57:26.716]  Where they arrest people for their speech, where they exempt themselves from taxes.
[00:57:26.716 --> 00:57:28.437]  I mean, it's a new royalty, isn't it?
[00:57:29.195 --> 00:57:30.816]  They exempt themselves from taxes.
[00:57:30.816 --> 00:57:36.918]  Worse, they exempt themselves also from civil suit and from criminal prosecution.
[00:57:36.918 --> 00:57:45.622]  And the people who run the Central Stability Pact... Yeah, tell folks who these new sovereigns are on these bureaucracies and how they set those up, briefly.
[00:57:45.622 --> 00:57:46.362]  I mean, this is amazing.
[00:57:46.362 --> 00:57:49.343]  Well, for instance, the European Stability Pact is a good example.
[00:57:49.343 --> 00:57:56.466]  This is the thing that was intended to address the collapse in the euro, which is still, of course, collapsing and will collapse still faster now that Britain's voted out.
[00:57:57.066 --> 00:58:13.137]  But they set up a governing body of absolute bankers, and these bankers have been given, by the treaty establishing the Stability Pact, total immunity from civil suit or criminal prosecution for any actions they take.
[00:58:13.137 --> 00:58:22.743]  And one of their actions that they are empowered by this treaty to take is to order any member state of the Stability Pact, fortunately not including Britain,
[00:58:23.303 --> 00:58:26.746]  To hand over any amount of money that they demand.
[00:58:26.746 --> 00:58:27.486]  That's the bail-in.
[00:58:27.486 --> 00:58:28.707]  As soon as they demand it.
[00:58:28.707 --> 00:58:30.669]  And that's how they're able to install leaders, too.
[00:58:30.669 --> 00:58:36.273]  That's how they're able to tell places like Greece or Italy, hey, here's your new leader.
[00:58:36.273 --> 00:58:39.376]  Back in 70 seconds with final comments from Warren Mumpkin and Kit Daniels.
[00:58:39.376 --> 00:58:40.537]  This is so incredible.
[00:58:40.537 --> 00:58:42.918]  World dictatorship is their goal.
[00:58:42.918 --> 00:58:43.699]  Kelly, it's amazing.

[00:59:52.038 --> 01:00:11.823]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:00:11.823 --> 01:00:16.484]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.330 --> 01:00:25.592]  Alright, again, I get upset.
[01:00:25.592 --> 01:00:31.536]  I start hyperventilating when we sit here and see open tyranny being set up and the general public's in a coma.
[01:00:31.536 --> 01:00:41.042]  I don't normally disagree with Lord Monckton because he's one of the leading experts on the EU tyranny and advised Margaret Thatcher on it who opposed going into it and spoke out against it.
[01:00:42.444 --> 01:00:46.929]  I mean, this is an unelected bureaucracy of mega-banks taking over countries and installing leaders.
[01:00:46.929 --> 01:00:50.894]  But just a closing comment from him and then one from Kit Daniels, the head of our next guest.
[01:00:50.894 --> 01:00:55.599]  We're going to Supreme Court rulings and more on Brexit coming up.
[01:00:55.599 --> 01:01:01.085]  I look at the euro, how they claim they set it up as a steel trade deal, an economic commission and all this.
[01:01:02.168 --> 01:01:06.590]  And I've seen some of the leaders of the Euro admit it was set up to consolidate control.
[01:01:06.590 --> 01:01:11.913]  I think it's been a tyranny from the beginning, and certainly is a naked tyranny now.
[01:01:11.913 --> 01:01:14.274]  I mean, why do you say it wasn't started as a tyranny, Lord Monckton?
[01:01:15.615 --> 01:01:23.158]  Originally, at least this was the official declared purpose, let's be clear about this, as a means of, it was called the European Coal and Steel Community.
[01:01:23.158 --> 01:01:27.560]  Its job was to make sure there was enough coal and steel to rebuild Europe after the Second World War.
[01:01:27.560 --> 01:01:30.881]  That was its... That was the Treaty of London in 48, wasn't it?
[01:01:30.881 --> 01:01:32.762]  And then in 56, the Treaty of Rome.
[01:01:33.482 --> 01:01:38.126]  And the Treaty of Rome was where it began to diverge from that original purpose.
[01:01:38.126 --> 01:01:50.396]  And because the treaty that set up the Coal and Steel community was a purely technocratic treaty just to make sure there was enough Coal and Steel to go round, that didn't need to be run democratically.
[01:01:50.896 --> 01:02:07.904]  But the people who then decided they would try and create a European super-state moved in, people like Jean Monnet, and they quite explicitly said, well, we don't want democracy, what we want is the governing elite to come together and form a Europe which we, the dictators, will run.
[01:02:07.904 --> 01:02:11.886]  And by the way, the German president just interrupted.
[01:02:11.886 --> 01:02:16.588]  Then promptly moved in and tried to do, bureaucratically, what they couldn't do by force of arms.
[01:02:17.168 --> 01:02:20.971]  And that has been the continuing problem with it ever since.
[01:02:20.971 --> 01:02:36.521]  And that is why, in the end, the likes of me, who at first were in favour of the free trade area, which the European Union originally was, when it was just the European Communities, we turned against it when it began galloping towards being the system that everyone can now see it becoming.
[01:02:36.701 --> 01:02:38.662]  And in closing, let me ask you this question.
[01:02:38.662 --> 01:02:40.103]  Infowars.com story.
[01:02:40.103 --> 01:02:43.024]  German president, there's video, says the elites are not the problem.
[01:02:43.024 --> 01:02:43.844]  This is a quote.
[01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:45.205]  The populations are the problem.
[01:02:45.205 --> 01:02:46.425]  Close quote.
[01:02:46.425 --> 01:02:48.746]  Are these people completely mentally ill?
[01:02:48.746 --> 01:02:50.087]  Why are they so arrogant?
[01:02:50.087 --> 01:02:54.309]  Why do they admit everything about world government, but then have their media say it doesn't exist?
[01:02:55.029 --> 01:03:00.572]  They are so arrogant precisely because the media have been so comprehensively captured.
[01:03:00.572 --> 01:03:11.657]  And if there's one book you need to read to work out how this was done, then it's Ion Mihai Pachapa, who was the head of the Securitate under Ceausescu's Romania.
[01:03:11.657 --> 01:03:20.982]  And he headed the disinformation directorate of the KGB, whose sole function was to denigrate and destroy the reputations of all the enemies of communism throughout Europe.
[01:03:21.742 --> 01:03:26.704]  And they managed to recruit a million European Communists.
[01:03:26.704 --> 01:03:27.064]  That's right.
[01:03:27.064 --> 01:03:34.686]  To help out in... And even after they fell, the brainwashed European Communists have continued the mission.
[01:03:34.686 --> 01:03:41.888]  They have indeed continued the mission, even though Pacheco eventually defected to the West and wrote a book saying that there were a million of them.
[01:03:41.888 --> 01:03:47.090]  When I tell people it was that many, they express shock and they just think I'm some kind of Reds Under the Beds merchant.
[01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:50.251]  But the phrase Reds Under the Beds was invented by Pacheco.
[01:03:50.251 --> 01:03:51.151]  It was invented as
[01:03:51.311 --> 01:03:55.273]  Well sure, they declassified a bunch of KGB files a few years ago and it was all documented.
[01:03:55.273 --> 01:04:00.555]  In fact, why don't you review that book for us and come back on and do a full hour about the controlled media in the future.
[01:04:00.555 --> 01:04:05.298]  Scienceandpublicpolicy.org, we salute you, congratulations Lord Monckton, and thank you for your fight.
[01:04:05.298 --> 01:04:13.602]  It's got to feel good to come from nowhere in the last 30 years, and you and Farage and others to be leading a global movement that I just feel honored to be part of, sir, and Trump is as well.
[01:04:14.386 --> 01:04:16.549]  Well, God bless you and thank you for your help, Alex.
[01:04:16.549 --> 01:04:18.152]  It's been absolutely vital.
[01:04:18.152 --> 01:04:18.693]  Well, thank you.
[01:04:18.693 --> 01:04:19.174]  It's amazing.
[01:04:19.174 --> 01:04:21.337]  We're not lying down, that's for sure.
[01:04:21.337 --> 01:04:23.060]  Kit, thank you for riding shotgun with us.
[01:04:23.060 --> 01:04:24.422]  More articles at InfoWars.
[01:04:24.422 --> 01:04:26.024]  Quick comment, Kit Daniels?
[01:04:26.024 --> 01:04:26.966]  Well, it's interesting, Alex.
[01:04:26.966 --> 01:04:29.390]  You said earlier that the EU is a Nazi program.
[01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:36.555]  Now it's interesting to point out that the Nazi Germany was not a technocracy, but they did put technocrats in power.
[01:04:36.555 --> 01:04:39.096]  That's what the Trilateral Commission grew out of in the 70s.
[01:04:39.096 --> 01:04:41.878]  You know, you had two separate movements, the U.S.
[01:04:41.878 --> 01:04:43.839]  technocracy and the German technocracy.
[01:04:43.839 --> 01:04:45.741]  The German technocracies would survive.
[01:04:45.741 --> 01:04:47.462]  I think the U.S.
[01:04:47.462 --> 01:04:51.124]  technocracy died in the 30s at the outbreak of World War II.
[01:04:51.124 --> 01:04:56.208]  So yeah, it's like Adolf Hitler was the last person to create a European super state.
[01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:58.349]  So yeah, this is a Nazi... It's incredible.
[01:04:58.349 --> 01:04:58.869]  Thank you, Kent.
[01:04:58.869 --> 01:04:59.570]  Thank you, Lord Monckton.
[01:05:00.210 --> 01:05:08.775]  Both GOP nominee Donald Trump and leftist investor George Soros have predicted the complete downfall of the European Union, despite Trump being a nationalist and Soros a globalist.
[01:05:08.775 --> 01:05:18.601]  The two billionaires both independently declared that they believe a domino effect has been started by Britain's decision to leave the EU and the process will be difficult for anyone to stop, as reported by Steve Watson.
[01:05:18.601 --> 01:05:19.462]  Soros said, quote,
[01:05:19.642 --> 01:05:25.364]  Now the catastrophic scenario that many feared has materialized, making the disintegration of the EU practically irreversible.
[01:05:25.364 --> 01:05:33.907]  Trump also predicted a complete breakup of the EU, and also warned that the continent would be completely unrecognizable within 10 years if strict immigration controls are not enacted.
[01:05:33.907 --> 01:05:35.127]  Trump told reporters, quote,
[01:05:41.169 --> 01:05:45.033]  Trump is referring to the resistance Scottish politicians are still giving Brexit.
[01:05:45.033 --> 01:05:47.535]  He continued, stating that, For more news, visit InfoWars.com.
[01:05:47.535 --> 01:05:48.596]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:05:59.701 --> 01:06:00.281]  I do not agree.
[01:06:00.281 --> 01:06:01.682]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[01:06:01.682 --> 01:06:03.022]  It took you over a year to do it.
[01:06:03.022 --> 01:06:04.242]  Why is this so good?
[01:06:04.242 --> 01:06:09.524]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[01:06:09.524 --> 01:06:23.068]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:06:23.068 --> 01:06:24.429]  Right now with all the refugees,
[01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:26.850]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[01:06:26.850 --> 01:06:29.431]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[01:06:29.431 --> 01:06:30.731]  These are all parasites.
[01:06:30.731 --> 01:06:31.832]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[01:06:31.832 --> 01:06:33.172]  There's so many things that are in it.
[01:06:33.172 --> 01:06:37.674]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[01:06:37.674 --> 01:06:40.956]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[01:06:40.956 --> 01:06:44.017]  Alright, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[01:06:44.017 --> 01:06:45.077]  It just came back in yesterday.
[01:06:45.077 --> 01:06:46.998]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLife.com.

[01:06:52.622 --> 01:06:53.985]  Infowarslive.com.
[01:06:53.985 --> 01:06:56.229]  Thank you Dr. Group from the Global Healing Center.
[01:06:56.229 --> 01:06:58.192]  Thank you so much for all your work sir on this great product.
[01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:07.867]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:07:07.867 --> 01:07:08.688]  Here's why.
[01:07:08.688 --> 01:07:12.830]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[01:07:12.830 --> 01:07:13.751]  So please listen.
[01:07:13.751 --> 01:07:17.453]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:07:17.453 --> 01:07:23.837]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:07:23.837 --> 01:07:27.940]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:31.123]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:07:31.123 --> 01:07:33.464]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:07:33.464 --> 01:07:38.308]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators.
[01:07:38.308 --> 01:07:45.054]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[01:07:45.054 --> 01:07:46.795]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:07:46.795 --> 01:07:48.497]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:07:48.497 --> 01:07:50.218]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:07:50.218 --> 01:07:54.101]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:07:54.101 --> 01:07:55.663]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:07:55.663 --> 01:07:57.024]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:08:02.930 --> 01:08:09.554]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[01:08:09.554 --> 01:08:14.377]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:14.377 --> 01:08:20.881]  In 2007, I shot a whole bunch of videos, probably wrote 10, 15 articles, had guests on.
[01:08:22.081 --> 01:08:37.480]  The British Ministry of Defense came out and said that by 2016-2017, they began to believe that global collapse would happen and that hundreds of millions would starve to death, there'd be huge mobs all over the world, basically burning things down.
[01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:38.141]  I didn't say that.
[01:08:39.065 --> 01:08:43.689]  I'm not really a fear porn dealer, but I do respect the British Ministry of Defense.
[01:08:43.689 --> 01:08:47.673]  And a declassified portion of that 23-page report was put out.
[01:08:47.673 --> 01:08:48.954]  The London Guardian picked it up.
[01:08:48.954 --> 01:08:52.017]  The headline was, Flash Mobs and Brain Chips.
[01:08:52.017 --> 01:08:52.638]  In Your Future.
[01:08:54.071 --> 01:08:58.393]  Then about two years later it turned out that was a report on a U.S.
[01:08:58.393 --> 01:09:11.419]  report that in 2009 got partially declassified, saying that global food production and other issues were going to cause a massive deficit that would begin in Africa and the Middle East and cause revolution.
[01:09:11.419 --> 01:09:14.981]  And they predicted it in around the year 2010, which happened right on time.
[01:09:16.721 --> 01:09:20.783]  And then it went on from there to describe the rest of the collapse of the world.
[01:09:20.783 --> 01:09:25.586]  I was attacked by the New York Times, you name it, that I was the fearmonger saying that.
[01:09:25.586 --> 01:09:38.872]  It's like when they have a major publication come out like the Army Times and admit they're doing army drills, and we point out, hey, it shows the US, you know, as their target and says Texas hostile.
[01:09:38.872 --> 01:09:41.614]  Is this more conditioning to accept military on the streets?
[01:09:43.424 --> 01:09:46.526]  And then they say that I said they were going to take over a few years ago and kill everybody.
[01:09:46.526 --> 01:09:47.346]  That's not what I'm saying.
[01:09:47.346 --> 01:09:49.667]  I'm saying what they're preparing for.
[01:09:49.667 --> 01:09:52.469]  And I know a lot of military people.
[01:09:52.469 --> 01:09:54.290]  You see a lot of them on the show.
[01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.451]  And they talk about the preparations for civil unrest.
[01:09:56.451 --> 01:10:00.413]  But hey, Vice of HBO has come out and said it.
[01:10:00.413 --> 01:10:02.735]  Oh my gosh, Drugs Report has two links today.
[01:10:02.735 --> 01:10:04.996]  It's up on Infowars.com as well.
[01:10:04.996 --> 01:10:06.397]  And we're going to our guest.
[01:10:07.463 --> 01:10:13.268]  FEMA contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395% food price spikes.
[01:10:13.268 --> 01:10:24.537]  Now, we predicted a 30% spike in the next year a few months ago when we offered 30% off to 40% off on M4 Select super high quality storable food powered by my Patreon.
[01:10:24.537 --> 01:10:26.359]  We private label to give you the lowest prices.
[01:10:26.359 --> 01:10:27.419]  It's already the lowest prices.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:29.181]  At its regular price.
[01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:30.642]  But we're doing 15% off.
[01:10:30.642 --> 01:10:34.565]  I saw this this morning and I said, look, this will sell food.
[01:10:34.565 --> 01:10:35.966]  People need food.
[01:10:35.966 --> 01:10:37.167]  And that helps support the broadcast.
[01:10:37.167 --> 01:10:37.707]  It's a win-win.
[01:10:37.707 --> 01:10:39.188]  But I said, this is scary.
[01:10:39.188 --> 01:10:40.929]  And I've read this story several times.
[01:10:40.929 --> 01:10:42.691]  We're going to cover it after Joseph Farah leaves us.
[01:10:43.491 --> 01:10:43.932]  The U.S.
[01:10:43.932 --> 01:10:49.896]  national security industry is planning for the impact of an unprecedented global food crisis lasting as long as a decade.
[01:10:49.896 --> 01:10:54.499]  That is the exact Pentagon Report 2006, British Report 2007.
[01:10:54.499 --> 01:11:06.508]  According to reports by government contractors, the studies published by the CNA Corporation, December 2015, oh you just learned that now, unreported until now, describe a detailed simulation of protracted global food crisis.
[01:11:06.508 --> 01:11:07.029]  And it goes on.
[01:11:08.629 --> 01:11:14.310]  Yeah, and it all starts in 2016, 2017, accelerates through 2020 to 2030.
[01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:15.671]  We broke this.
[01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:17.651]  We've basically broken everything.
[01:11:17.651 --> 01:11:19.711]  And guess who else has broken all this?
[01:11:19.711 --> 01:11:20.972]  WorldNetDaily.com.
[01:11:20.972 --> 01:11:23.592]  And listen, I don't get paid to say that.
[01:11:23.592 --> 01:11:26.273]  Joseph Farah, when they got the, and I'm not, because he hates this.
[01:11:26.273 --> 01:11:27.073]  He wants to come on and cover news.
[01:11:27.073 --> 01:11:28.053]  He says, please don't talk about me.
[01:11:28.053 --> 01:11:29.714]  He said this before, Alex, but I'm going to do it.
[01:11:29.714 --> 01:11:35.335]  Because I got to just call out these heroes like Drudge and Lord Monckton and Martin Moreno and others.
[01:11:38.001 --> 01:11:56.135]  When they did a FOIA request last year and got the thousands of pages from the Clinton Foundation, from the Clinton Library, it was all how to stop the new press in the future, how to stop Joseph Farah and the Western Journalism Center, because if Joseph Farah succeeds, it'll change the face of media and there'll be new independent media.
[01:11:56.135 --> 01:11:57.796]  We've got to block liberals and conservatives.
[01:11:57.796 --> 01:11:59.518]  We've got to call them conspiracy theorists.
[01:11:59.518 --> 01:12:01.139]  Order the controlled media to do that.
[01:12:01.139 --> 01:12:05.783]  So we literally are getting the guy on that led the way to what
[01:12:06.917 --> 01:12:09.639]  Drudge was able to do what we've done and what you're able to do.
[01:12:09.639 --> 01:12:12.741]  Some will say, well I hope Drudge gets shut down by the Federal Elections Commission.
[01:12:12.741 --> 01:12:13.522]  I hope you do.
[01:12:13.522 --> 01:12:14.442]  I'll get bigger.
[01:12:14.442 --> 01:12:15.903]  No, they'll shut you down too.
[01:12:15.903 --> 01:12:18.085]  And now they're handing the internet over to the UN.
[01:12:18.085 --> 01:12:20.066]  That's in the Washington Post today.
[01:12:20.066 --> 01:12:23.788]  So all I'm saying is everything we warned of is epically now happening.
[01:12:23.788 --> 01:12:33.115]  So I want to ask Joseph Farah, in the limited time we have, he's a busy guy, I want to cover Brexit, I want to cover Trump with him, talk to one of the wise men out there, a true patriot,
[01:12:34.096 --> 01:12:49.163]  What point have we gotten to, Joseph, WND.com, where everything we've talked about is now admitted, our credibility is exploding, but instead the globalist left just says they're going to arrest everybody, and the democratic platform now says arrest climate change deniers.
[01:12:49.163 --> 01:12:51.424]  I mean, it's just crazy.
[01:12:51.424 --> 01:12:52.665]  It's bizarre.
[01:12:52.665 --> 01:12:53.605]  What is going on?
[01:12:53.605 --> 01:12:54.686]  Where do you think this is going?
[01:12:56.278 --> 01:13:02.180]  Well, it's not going in a good direction, that's for sure, Alex, and thank you very much for having me on, by the way.
[01:13:02.180 --> 01:13:02.960]  I appreciate it.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:04.540]  We haven't visited for a while.
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:08.722]  Oh, I had to twist your arm, let's be honest.
[01:13:08.722 --> 01:13:10.462]  I didn't think you liked me anymore.
[01:13:10.462 --> 01:13:13.883]  But, you know, we're in a world of hurt.
[01:13:13.883 --> 01:13:15.764]  I mean, I don't know what else to say.
[01:13:15.764 --> 01:13:18.785]  I mean, there's not much good news on the horizon.
[01:13:18.785 --> 01:13:23.506]  We look for it every day so people don't go insane, but it is hard to find.
[01:13:24.707 --> 01:13:27.630]  You know, I think you talk about good news.
[01:13:27.630 --> 01:13:33.174]  You know, I think what we saw happen in Great Britain last week was some good news.
[01:13:33.174 --> 01:13:48.545]  You know, I think the people, and it's not just people in the United States obviously, are beginning to see so much of the kinds of things that we've been talking about, the terrible direction we've been going in, and they're reacting as best they can.
[01:13:48.545 --> 01:13:49.686]  The question is whether
[01:13:50.359 --> 01:13:55.941]  You know, the ruling authorities are going to pay attention to the will of the people.
[01:13:55.941 --> 01:14:00.623]  We've got an election coming up this year, I think, as far as that goes.
[01:14:00.623 --> 01:14:11.107]  You know, in the past, you could argue whether there was a dime's worth of difference between the Republican nominee and the Democratic nominee.
[01:14:11.107 --> 01:14:12.348]  We talked about that in 2004, 2008, and 2012.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.022]  And, you know, it was arguable.
[01:14:22.022 --> 01:14:24.943]  It's not even arguable.
[01:14:24.943 --> 01:14:31.546]  In this election, there's trillions of dollars worth of difference between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.
[01:14:31.546 --> 01:14:32.146]  Would you agree?
[01:14:32.146 --> 01:14:35.428]  Oh, there is light years of difference.
[01:14:35.428 --> 01:14:38.149]  And we see the establishment showing that.
[01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:39.430]  I mean, they're so afraid.
[01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:41.851]  Why are they so afraid of Trump?
[01:14:41.851 --> 01:14:43.392]  Because he cannot be controlled.
[01:14:43.965 --> 01:14:51.772]  I mean, you know, this is a guy who, when he talks to the American people, they listen.
[01:14:51.772 --> 01:14:53.933]  The media cannot control this guy.
[01:14:53.933 --> 01:14:57.756]  When I say he can't be controlled, I'm really talking about the media, because what are they going to do?
[01:14:57.756 --> 01:14:59.478]  They have to stop covering him.
[01:14:59.478 --> 01:15:01.479]  They have to stop putting him on TV.
[01:15:01.479 --> 01:15:04.482]  That hurts their ratings when they do that.
[01:15:04.482 --> 01:15:06.584]  Now you're hitting them right in the bottom line.
[01:15:06.584 --> 01:15:11.147]  And this is what is so spectacular, I think, about this election.
[01:15:11.147 --> 01:15:12.649]  It's such a quantum
[01:15:13.493 --> 01:15:19.374]  Different from the recent elections we've seen over many, many years.
[01:15:19.374 --> 01:15:23.655]  And he does know his timing because all over the world nationalists and patriots are getting in.
[01:15:23.655 --> 01:15:24.856]  There's a popular surge.
[01:15:24.856 --> 01:15:26.396]  That was my earlier question.
[01:15:26.396 --> 01:15:34.998]  The paradox of huge global awakening, world government out in the open, totalitarian, and so people are really waking up, but at the same time the left
[01:15:35.618 --> 01:15:41.482]  He's re-entrenching and just getting more violent, more bizarre, more mentally ill, more anti-free speech.
[01:15:41.482 --> 01:15:47.106]  I mean, you know I've been a big critic of the Republicans just like you've been and some fake conservatives.
[01:15:47.106 --> 01:15:51.069]  But with the left, it seems like they've collectively gone completely insane.
[01:15:51.069 --> 01:15:51.989]  Well, that's the danger.
[01:15:51.989 --> 01:15:55.332]  We've always, you know, we've always seen the totalitarian nature.
[01:15:56.607 --> 01:16:00.730]  of this, you know, movement that is, they call themselves progressives.
[01:16:00.730 --> 01:16:01.591]  I love that.
[01:16:01.591 --> 01:16:08.716]  But that, between quotes, you know, what are they progressing toward is the big question.
[01:16:08.716 --> 01:16:16.341]  And, you know, but ultimately, we're seeing like never before, the totalitarian nature of the left.
[01:16:16.341 --> 01:16:18.623]  And so we're living in very dangerous times here.
[01:16:19.235 --> 01:16:30.760]  We're seeing, you know, at the same time we see the expression in Great Britain against globalism, for independence, for accountability from government.
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:33.461]  We also see, you know, I'll just point to a headline today.
[01:16:33.461 --> 01:16:38.784]  The Supreme Court overturns a case in Texas.
[01:16:38.784 --> 01:16:43.426]  I wanted to bring that up to you, and then they say, oh, when it's a split court it leans left.
[01:16:43.426 --> 01:16:48.668]  So Scalia's magically out of the way, and now here's Kennedy again shooting down state laws.
[01:16:49.341 --> 01:16:50.841]  Yeah, what was going on in Texas?
[01:16:50.841 --> 01:16:55.343]  Now, I don't care whether you're pro-life, pro-abortion, whatever.
[01:16:55.343 --> 01:17:11.407]  The question on the table is, does Texas have the right, the power as a state, a sovereign state, to require certain health and safety standards regarding abortion clinics?
[01:17:11.407 --> 01:17:12.868]  That seems to me to be a no-brainer.
[01:17:12.868 --> 01:17:16.429]  Yeah, there's more regulations on a Baskin-Robbins than there is an abortuary.
[01:17:17.295 --> 01:17:18.656]  Exactly right.
[01:17:18.656 --> 01:17:21.740]  And so the Supreme Court knows better.
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:25.844]  How is that even... You know, it just defies all logic.
[01:17:25.844 --> 01:17:28.026]  And we've seen this over and over again.
[01:17:28.026 --> 01:17:30.629]  You know, the totalitarian nature of this court.
[01:17:30.629 --> 01:17:32.591]  It's manifest.
[01:17:35.294 --> 01:17:41.703]  And so, you know, we're in the same position, maybe even in a worse position, than the British people were.
[01:17:41.703 --> 01:17:47.811]  And we're, you know, it's not because we're necessarily part of a European Union-style situation.
[01:17:47.811 --> 01:17:49.814]  No, it's that our tyranny is the Supreme Court!
[01:17:50.374 --> 01:17:53.677]  That's right, we're under the control of Washington D.C.
[01:17:53.677 --> 01:17:54.859]  Washington D.C.
[01:17:54.859 --> 01:18:01.065]  is acting sovereign over the states and over local jurisdictions and so forth.
[01:18:01.065 --> 01:18:03.967]  It's just, the situation is untenable.
[01:18:07.503 --> 01:18:08.163]  Mm-hmm.
[01:18:08.163 --> 01:18:09.264]  How do we do it?
[01:18:09.264 --> 01:18:11.125]  Is there a mechanism for that?
[01:18:11.125 --> 01:18:12.786]  It's called the Constitution.
[01:18:12.786 --> 01:18:13.927]  That's the mechanism.
[01:18:13.927 --> 01:18:15.568]  But they just ignore it.
[01:18:15.568 --> 01:18:22.732]  I mean, the Constitution strictly limits the power of the federal government, but we don't see that.
[01:18:22.732 --> 01:18:26.174]  And what about the checks and balances in the system?
[01:18:26.174 --> 01:18:30.677]  You know, isn't it supposed to be the legislative branch that makes the laws?
[01:18:30.677 --> 01:18:36.280]  How often do we see this president effectively making laws, issuing edicts?
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.282]  To, you know, all 50 states.
[01:18:46.024 --> 01:18:55.427]  Where the United Nations, here's the headline, I'm grabbing it out of the stack, UN, this is ABC News, KRGV, more Central Americans headed to the U.S.
[01:18:55.427 --> 01:19:05.731]  and they admit they're here illegally, the UN's running the program in Central America, they have a deal with Mexico, they ship them up here illegally and then they put them on buses inside the U.S.
[01:19:05.731 --> 01:19:08.032]  and then ship them to Democratic Party facilities.
[01:19:08.032 --> 01:19:09.973]  This is what we broke two years ago with our reporters.
[01:19:11.073 --> 01:19:12.794]  They're coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[01:19:12.794 --> 01:19:13.915]  They're in McAllen.
[01:19:13.915 --> 01:19:15.596]  I mean, the Supreme Court ruled to stop it.
[01:19:15.596 --> 01:19:17.117]  He's violating the law.
[01:19:17.117 --> 01:19:20.159]  So when he doesn't like what the Supreme Court says, he ignores it.
[01:19:20.159 --> 01:19:22.420]  But when he does like it, he goes for it.
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:22.920]  Right.
[01:19:22.920 --> 01:19:23.981]  Exactly right.
[01:19:23.981 --> 01:19:25.982]  And you talk about the immigration issue.
[01:19:25.982 --> 01:19:32.386]  This is ultimately, I think, what was the real catalyst behind this Brexit vote.
[01:19:32.386 --> 01:19:34.067]  And here we are.
[01:19:34.067 --> 01:19:34.487]  Are we in
[01:19:35.208 --> 01:19:36.869]  Better shape than they are?
[01:19:36.869 --> 01:19:37.809]  Or worse shape?
[01:19:37.809 --> 01:19:48.193]  The only thing we're going to be able to do, honestly, from a pragmatic, political standpoint, is to elect Donald Trump in 2016.
[01:19:48.193 --> 01:19:57.477]  You know, I can't say, as I may have once suggested to people, that it makes a heck of a big difference who we elect to Congress.
[01:19:57.477 --> 01:19:59.677]  We did that in 2010.
[01:19:59.677 --> 01:20:00.838]  How did that work out for us?
[01:20:01.118 --> 01:20:04.259]  I was about to say, you and I admitted our failure.
[01:20:04.259 --> 01:20:13.223]  We were so sick of George W. Bush as more libertarian patriots that we sat out the 2008 election because McCain was so horrible.
[01:20:13.223 --> 01:20:15.024]  But now look at what we've got.
[01:20:15.024 --> 01:20:17.525]  McCain knew he was a shell.
[01:20:17.525 --> 01:20:20.326]  He knew he was a fall guy like a Don King boxing match.
[01:20:20.326 --> 01:20:22.027]  He was there to take a dive.
[01:20:22.027 --> 01:20:25.989]  But we should have just still elected that puppet because he's an old evil white guy.
[01:20:25.989 --> 01:20:27.429]  He wouldn't have had the race car to play.
[01:20:27.429 --> 01:20:28.850]  He couldn't have got any of this done.
[01:20:29.797 --> 01:20:30.578]  Exactly.
[01:20:30.578 --> 01:20:33.520]  I mean, you know, in retrospect, who knows?
[01:20:33.520 --> 01:20:35.402]  But the point is this.
[01:20:35.402 --> 01:20:40.606]  You know, what we need is not just shaking up Washington by electing a president.
[01:20:40.606 --> 01:20:48.873]  We've got to actually create or recreate an alternative political party in Washington.
[01:20:48.873 --> 01:20:51.836]  And that's what I think Trump is uniquely positioned to do.
[01:20:52.803 --> 01:20:55.606]  Uh, and you know, let me ask you a question, Alex.
[01:20:55.606 --> 01:21:02.512]  Do you believe these polls that are coming out now, you know, that he's 10 points behind Hillary and so forth?
[01:21:02.512 --> 01:21:03.773]  What does your gut tell you?
[01:21:03.773 --> 01:21:07.297]  I had a 30-minute conversation with Roger Stowe yesterday.
[01:21:08.820 --> 01:21:22.871]  Quizzing him about another Trump insider inside the campaign that I talked to and he confirmed a lot of what I was told and it was so staggering that I wrote a bunch of notes and then never, I haven't even covered it yet.
[01:21:22.871 --> 01:21:27.674]  I was thinking about covering it next hour or writing an article about it because you know you got a big story and you don't even know how to deal with it, it's so big.
[01:21:30.456 --> 01:21:35.884]  He was confirming some of the internal polling they've done, showing that Trump's pretty much in a dead heat everywhere.
[01:21:35.884 --> 01:21:41.231]  If they just do a fair poll, you know, if they cast it the way Hillary's casting it the other way, he's like 10 points ahead.
[01:21:41.231 --> 01:21:46.438]  And he went on to say in a lot of key states he's way ahead, but he said many people are so intimidated
[01:21:47.399 --> 01:21:49.700]  People ask, why is the left out stabbing people?
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:50.640]  Why are they out attacking?
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.181]  Why are they beating up old ladies when it makes them look so bad?
[01:21:53.181 --> 01:21:54.121]  They don't care.
[01:21:54.121 --> 01:21:57.062]  They want to scare you away from coming out to vote.
[01:21:57.062 --> 01:22:00.363]  They want to scare you from saying you're for Trump.
[01:22:00.363 --> 01:22:01.223]  They've done their numbers.
[01:22:01.223 --> 01:22:02.184]  They've done their actuary.
[01:22:02.184 --> 01:22:02.904]  So the truth is...
[01:22:04.045 --> 01:22:25.468]  From the polls they've done in focus groups, they're thinking upwards of 10 to 14 percentage of people, whether they be Democrat or Republicans or non-voters, folks that have been out of the system for a while, that really Trump's going to win with a Reagan-style landslide, but they think Hillary is just trying to act like she's really winning and having the media say it because they're looking at probably stealing the election.
[01:22:25.996 --> 01:22:31.380]  Well, that is exactly what I have been saying now for some time.
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:37.806]  I believe that Trump can cause a political realignment in this country like we haven't seen since 1980.
[01:22:37.806 --> 01:22:45.612]  I don't base it on the polls, because with the polls you've got to actually see how they were pushing.
[01:22:45.612 --> 01:22:47.894]  But also, exactly, people are scared to say they're for Trump.
[01:22:47.894 --> 01:22:48.895]  That's why I wear a hat.
[01:22:49.475 --> 01:22:55.399]  Donald Trump hat when I'm downtown around, you know, communist areas because I want to get it in their face and they run in fear.
[01:22:55.399 --> 01:22:56.420]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:58.681]  Right.
[01:22:58.681 --> 01:23:01.603]  My opinion has been based on the anecdotal
[01:23:02.333 --> 01:23:04.616]  We all have family like that.
[01:23:21.554 --> 01:23:22.175]  For Trump.
[01:23:22.175 --> 01:23:23.556]  Can't wait to vote for Trump.
[01:23:23.556 --> 01:23:33.244]  And this has caused, I don't know what it is about Donald Trump, and honestly, because I wish I had that magic to vote for my own sister, right?
[01:23:33.244 --> 01:23:48.378]  And I see this over and over with people, not just my relatives, people I run into who, you know, you would think, or you have reason to believe that they are Democrats, liberals, progressives, what have you.
[01:23:48.738 --> 01:23:51.539]  And this is a whole different ballgame for them.
[01:23:51.539 --> 01:23:58.303]  Trump, the personality Trump, because of his outspokenness, his forthrightness, and look at that speech!
[01:23:58.962 --> 01:24:02.223]  He gave about Hillary last week.
[01:24:02.223 --> 01:24:04.363]  I mean, that was amazing.
[01:24:04.363 --> 01:24:12.085]  That proves he's for real, that he's so hardcore, that shows he is definitely not a shill for Hillary, we know that now.
[01:24:12.085 --> 01:24:22.508]  Have we seen a Republican presidential candidate go on the attack and it was not personal, it was not, everything he said in that speech was
[01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:25.081]  Dead accurate.
[01:24:25.081 --> 01:24:30.247]  You could have been listening to Alex Jones or Joseph Barra give that speech.
[01:24:30.247 --> 01:24:31.048]  That's what we've got.
[01:24:31.048 --> 01:24:34.953]  Now look, I'm not saying Donald Trump is perfect.
[01:24:34.953 --> 01:24:38.358]  I didn't even support him personally.
[01:24:38.838 --> 01:24:40.520]  I was a Ted Cruz guy.
[01:24:58.570 --> 01:25:06.172]  And you have to admit, I think, just objectively, that he is in the best position to challenge this woman.
[01:25:06.172 --> 01:25:10.313]  Because he will tell you exactly what she is.
[01:25:10.313 --> 01:25:16.494]  And, you know, it's going to be up to... That's why I say it's not a dime's worth of difference this time.
[01:25:16.494 --> 01:25:18.875]  It's trillions and trillions of dollars.
[01:25:18.875 --> 01:25:28.137]  It's probably the last chance we have to elect a president that's going to, you know, give us the chance.
[01:25:28.635 --> 01:25:32.118]  Not just to change direction, but to do a 180.
[01:25:32.118 --> 01:25:34.159]  And I really believe that's the opportunity.
[01:25:34.159 --> 01:25:35.280]  And that's why they're so scared of him.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:40.684]  That's why they say he's unelectable, couldn't get the nomination above the law, because they know he's the best candidate.
[01:25:40.684 --> 01:25:44.267]  Their fear, you know, shows us that something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
[01:25:44.267 --> 01:25:50.772]  Let me ask you this question, because, you know, I was your smart news guy who had the instincts to envision the whole internet, you know, resistance the whole nine yards.
[01:25:50.772 --> 01:25:54.875]  I'm the founding fathers of the current, you know, wave of liberty worldwide.
[01:25:54.875 --> 01:25:56.576]  Joseph Farah, joining us here today on WND.com.
[01:25:58.457 --> 01:25:59.917]  What do we hammer on most?
[01:25:59.917 --> 01:26:04.059]  I don't think there's been enough talk about how she sold us out to the Communist Chinese with the missile secrets.
[01:26:04.059 --> 01:26:05.139]  Let me just throw that out at you.
[01:26:05.139 --> 01:26:06.579]  What about this?
[01:26:06.579 --> 01:26:18.423]  What about hammering the point that, I know you've done this, but I mean, that she gets a hundred million dollars from Gulf states that keep women as prisoners, but then runs and executes homosexuals, then she runs around to gay pride parades.
[01:26:18.423 --> 01:26:19.903]  I mean, the hypocrisy.
[01:26:19.903 --> 01:26:22.364]  What about hammering her Brian Williams moment?
[01:26:22.364 --> 01:26:27.285]  What do we do to reach out to her idiot supporters and get them out of their stupid trance?
[01:26:27.765 --> 01:26:34.190]  I think that, again, that speech by Trump was so perfectly crafted to do just that.
[01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:42.215]  To turn people who, you know, out of anger or whatever, maybe ignorance, supported Bernie Sanders, you know, in the primaries.
[01:26:42.215 --> 01:26:44.837]  But they know what Hillary is.
[01:26:44.837 --> 01:26:49.921]  They know she is as corrupt as anybody who's ever run for president before.
[01:26:49.921 --> 01:26:52.883]  And, you know, if they're going to vote at all.
[01:26:53.848 --> 01:26:59.074]  I think a lot of them, and the polls even show this, that a lot of them will turn to Trump.
[01:26:59.074 --> 01:27:02.738]  That's why I say I think we're looking at a major realignment here.
[01:27:05.743 --> 01:27:16.108]  I've got a lot of friends and even relatives who work in government in Washington, you know, under the dome, and they're worried about, you know, losing Congress.
[01:27:16.108 --> 01:27:18.570]  I think Trump's going to help every Republican.
[01:27:18.570 --> 01:27:18.930]  I agree.
[01:27:18.930 --> 01:27:23.072]  Let me ask, in the time we have left, what happens if they steal the election from him?
[01:27:23.072 --> 01:27:28.315]  I mean, don't they know he's just a manifestation of rising nationalism, populism, and disgust with corruption?
[01:27:28.942 --> 01:27:36.065]  Well, he's the biggest fear that Washington insiders of both parties have.
[01:27:36.065 --> 01:27:42.388]  That, again, confirms for me that we're on the right track here with Donald Trump.
[01:27:42.388 --> 01:27:45.910]  I totally agree, but what happens if they do steal the election from him?
[01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:49.352]  Well, I mean, if they steal the election from him, it's all over.
[01:27:49.352 --> 01:27:51.833]  I mean, you know, America's over.
[01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:52.993]  Quite honestly, right?
[01:27:52.993 --> 01:27:54.114]  What can I do?
[01:27:54.114 --> 01:27:55.995]  I agree, that's not rhetoric.
[01:27:55.995 --> 01:27:58.016]  We've really reached the point where it's do or die.
[01:27:58.601 --> 01:28:01.504]  Yeah, no question about it.
[01:28:01.504 --> 01:28:03.666]  I want to ask you another question.
[01:28:03.666 --> 01:28:05.988]  I love interviewing you on your own show.
[01:28:05.988 --> 01:28:10.812]  What do you make of this, I'm sure you've seen it, this UN military
[01:28:11.405 --> 01:28:19.047]  Convoys all over the country, now they're in Virginia, but of course we've seen them in many, many other states over the years.
[01:28:19.047 --> 01:28:20.687]  What do you make of this?
[01:28:20.687 --> 01:28:22.068]  What is going on that we don't know?
[01:28:22.068 --> 01:28:35.291]  They've got them, listen, I would just ask the question 15 years ago just like you did, and this all started maybe 20, and then they've just got caches everywhere, they're newer equipment, they're not just old stuff, they're refurbishing.
[01:28:36.452 --> 01:28:38.854]  It's bizarre and now all the news it's the U.N.
[01:28:38.854 --> 01:28:39.714]  says this, the U.N.
[01:28:39.714 --> 01:28:40.715]  says that, the U.N.'
[01:28:40.695 --> 01:28:42.817]  's bringing in refugees to Texas, the U.N.'
[01:28:42.797 --> 01:28:44.639]  's going to watch our police departments.
[01:28:44.639 --> 01:28:50.624]  I think they're getting ready for a total collapse and maybe states not being part of the Union and I think they're getting ready for Civil War too.
[01:28:50.624 --> 01:28:57.149]  I'm not saying it's coming, Joseph, but they've got battle tanks being brought into the U.S., being shipped in, not out.
[01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:58.671]  You know, Abrams tanks with U.N.
[01:28:58.671 --> 01:28:59.531]  on the side.
[01:28:59.531 --> 01:29:01.073]  Something this way wicked comes.
[01:29:01.073 --> 01:29:02.033]  We'd be idiots not to think so.
[01:29:02.033 --> 01:29:02.374]  What do you think?
[01:29:03.183 --> 01:29:04.244]  Well, absolutely.
[01:29:04.244 --> 01:29:09.107]  I mean, you have to ask yourself, what are the alternative theories?
[01:29:09.107 --> 01:29:10.587]  I can't think of any.
[01:29:10.587 --> 01:29:12.749]  That's the scary thing.
[01:29:12.749 --> 01:29:14.270]  And you mentioned earlier the U.N.
[01:29:14.270 --> 01:29:20.273]  role in the border and immigration from the southern border, but it is the U.N.
[01:29:20.273 --> 01:29:24.896]  that is also determining where these so-called Syrian refugees go.
[01:29:25.718 --> 01:29:28.721]  They could activate them to start rioting, just like they've done in Europe, and use that.
[01:29:28.721 --> 01:29:34.325]  I mean, these are brand new Hunger Games giant-style armored vehicles being shipped around the U.S.
[01:29:34.325 --> 01:29:35.406]  in cash.
[01:29:35.406 --> 01:29:36.106]  We've got to cover this.
[01:29:36.106 --> 01:29:39.429]  Joseph Farah, WND.com, thank you so much for coming on.
[01:29:39.429 --> 01:29:41.030]  All right, keep the faith, buddy.
[01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:42.191]  Wow, he just brought up that topic.
[01:29:42.191 --> 01:29:42.792]  I need to cover that.
[01:29:42.792 --> 01:29:46.775]  We're going to cover that when we come back, along with the food shortage issue.
[01:29:46.775 --> 01:29:48.717]  395% global food shortage.
[01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:49.437]  That's from FEMA.
[01:29:49.437 --> 01:29:50.238]  We're on the march.
[01:29:50.765 --> 01:29:53.134]  This is hardcore!
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:03.883]  Finally, the mainstream media is reporting on what we broke two years ago.
[01:30:03.883 --> 01:30:04.283]  The U.S.
[01:30:04.283 --> 01:30:11.689]  Customs and Border Patrol, under pressure from the Obama administration, is purchasing bus tickets for illegals to ship them deeper into the country at taxpayers' expense.
[01:30:11.689 --> 01:30:23.599]  Local news station KRGV is now covering how the McAllen, Texas bus station is used as a transit hub for illegals Obama is bringing into the country, which Infowars.com exclusively broke in 2014 when no one else dared to report on it.
[01:30:23.599 --> 01:30:28.323]  KRGV has revealed that over 100 illegals a day are being dropped off at the McAllen station.
[01:30:28.323 --> 01:30:28.523]  And, in 2014,
[01:30:29.884 --> 01:30:36.066]  InfoWars reported on how the Obama administration was ordering the Border Patrol to release illegals they've apprehended after crossing the border.
[01:30:36.066 --> 01:30:45.088]  But, as part of their release, the illegals are transported to the McAllen bus station by Border Patrol agents who then buy them tickets to go wherever they want to go in the U.S.
[01:30:45.088 --> 01:30:48.929]  So, for example, if the illegals have relatives in Boston, that's where they get to go.
[01:30:48.929 --> 01:30:52.070]  And taxpayers are paying for this illegal smuggling operation.
[01:30:52.070 --> 01:30:55.971]  To find out more about Obama's lawlessness, visit InfoWars.com.
[01:30:55.971 --> 01:30:57.251]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[01:31:00.103 --> 01:31:04.066]  Secret 12, InfoWars Life's Vitamin B12 formulation.
[01:31:04.066 --> 01:31:10.370]  Most forms of Vitamin B12 are highly processed and synthetic, and cannot be properly absorbed by the body.
[01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:17.374]  That's why for real results, so many are having to turn to painful B12 injections, which are known to have higher absorption rates.
[01:31:17.674 --> 01:31:26.786]  Infowarslife.com is excited to announce that we can bring you our most bioactive, powerful form of B12 that has been developed with our exclusive, perfected process.
[01:31:26.786 --> 01:31:32.954]  Secret 12 is a binary of nutrimedical-grade, bioavailable, coenzyme forms of B12.
[01:31:32.954 --> 01:31:35.657]  Methylcobalamin, the same kind used in B12 injections.
[01:31:36.358 --> 01:31:37.158]  We're good to go.
[01:31:59.741 --> 01:32:00.562]  Hey, everyone!
[01:32:00.562 --> 01:32:02.864]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[01:32:02.864 --> 01:32:06.707]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[01:32:06.707 --> 01:32:08.789]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:19.058]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[01:32:19.058 --> 01:32:25.044]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[01:32:25.504 --> 01:32:42.362]  If you're dealing with a health challenge, or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into your day-to-day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients, the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats, and amino acids it needs to do its healing work,
[01:32:42.802 --> 01:32:46.264]  You need to check out Infowarsteam.com.
[01:32:46.264 --> 01:32:48.224]  Give your body the gift of good nutrition.

[01:32:55.567 --> 01:33:02.870]  That's Infowarsteam.com.
[01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:08.513]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:08.513 --> 01:33:10.074]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:36.983 --> 01:33:39.606]  You'll take my life, but I'll take yours too!
[01:33:39.606 --> 01:33:43.130]  You're fire musket, but I'll run you through!
[01:33:43.130 --> 01:33:49.677]  So when you're waiting for the next attack, you better stand, there's no turning back!
[01:33:49.677 --> 01:33:52.721]  Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:33:52.721 --> 01:33:53.101]  to 3 p.m.
[01:33:53.101 --> 01:33:53.602]  Central.
[01:33:53.602 --> 01:33:57.046]  We're here broadcasting worldwide.
[01:33:59.205 --> 01:34:00.286]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:34:00.286 --> 01:34:12.677]  I'm promoting free market, open societies, based on free will and free association, and based on human instinct, human spirit, and basic common sense.
[01:34:12.677 --> 01:34:16.560]  That is all 180 degrees the opposite of what the globalists are pushing.
[01:34:18.237 --> 01:34:22.898]  You know, I remember having Dr. Blaylock on like 20 years ago, top brain surgeon.
[01:34:22.898 --> 01:34:25.739]  He was still a brain surgeon at the time before he retired.
[01:34:25.739 --> 01:34:33.781]  All these other experts on, saying low-fat diets are causing Alzheimer's and brain damage and heart disease.
[01:34:33.781 --> 01:34:34.741]  And they had studies there.
[01:34:34.741 --> 01:34:40.923]  I remember my dad saying it was trans fats, artificial fats, burnt fats that are bad.
[01:34:42.069 --> 01:34:44.470]  Oh, but now it was in the New York Times last week.
[01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:46.450]  I have the article and the Huffington Post.
[01:34:46.450 --> 01:34:47.590]  Oh my gosh!
[01:34:47.590 --> 01:34:53.532]  Women need more complex fats because it's good for their skin and your brain.
[01:34:53.532 --> 01:34:56.953]  Oh my, let's give them a Pulitzer Prize!
[01:34:56.953 --> 01:35:01.974]  Zuckerberg came out on Friday in the New York Times and it said, Zuckerberg covers up his webcam.
[01:35:01.974 --> 01:35:03.234]  That was the headline.
[01:35:03.234 --> 01:35:04.095]  You should too.
[01:35:05.677 --> 01:35:13.000]  About 19, 20 years after I pioneered it and have been made fun of at least 18 years ago on BBC Documentaries.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.102]  Alex, John Ronson asks, why is your webcam covered?
[01:35:17.102 --> 01:35:19.623]  You think, say, watching you do, say?
[01:35:19.623 --> 01:35:26.105]  Oh, the little Poli-Wolf think he got a little, little bit of a problem, huh?
[01:35:26.105 --> 01:35:29.387]  Oh, you think little Green Man won't get you too, huh?
[01:35:29.387 --> 01:35:31.027]  And werewolves as well.
[01:35:31.027 --> 01:35:34.429]  He once asked me, he goes, you believe in werewolves?
[01:35:35.435 --> 01:35:39.816]  Because we're driving through this fog area and I go, no I just said it looks like where a werewolf would live.
[01:35:39.816 --> 01:35:41.517]  Man, look at that, like six foot deep.
[01:35:41.517 --> 01:35:45.418]  You afraid of the werewolves?
[01:35:45.418 --> 01:35:48.619]  And I said, yeah I'm real afraid of the werewolves.
[01:35:48.619 --> 01:35:50.999]  She actually put it in this book that I'm afraid of werewolves.
[01:35:50.999 --> 01:35:54.560]  I love it.
[01:35:54.560 --> 01:35:55.480]  I don't know, it's just funny.
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:35:56.341]  I actually like John Ross.
[01:35:56.341 --> 01:35:57.701]  We should get him back up on the show sometime.
[01:35:59.778 --> 01:36:01.739]  You afraid of the werewolves, Alex?
[01:36:01.739 --> 01:36:07.581]  He didn't really speak with that Oliver Twist Cockney accent, but it's fun to talk like that, isn't it?
[01:36:07.581 --> 01:36:16.024]  But there's something intellectual about almost the calm, lazy eyes of the left.
[01:36:16.024 --> 01:36:21.887]  We don't want to arrest you unless you deny global warming.
[01:36:21.887 --> 01:36:23.747]  Oh, no one really wants to arrest you.
[01:36:23.747 --> 01:36:26.949]  Oh, actually, we do now.
[01:36:26.949 --> 01:36:27.649]  That's liberal.
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:30.341]  There's a jail cell waiting for you.
[01:36:30.341 --> 01:36:32.481]  It's like Bill Nye the Science Guy.
[01:36:32.481 --> 01:36:35.242]  Mark Moran goes, you don't really want to arrest climate change and ours.
[01:36:35.242 --> 01:36:36.723]  He goes, yes, actually we do.
[01:36:36.723 --> 01:36:39.144]  We're going to arrest you.
[01:36:39.144 --> 01:36:44.525]  Wow, you're really dangerous.
[01:36:44.525 --> 01:36:46.146]  But it's easy, you see.
[01:36:46.146 --> 01:36:50.607]  They think if they go with the establishment, they end up getting power.
[01:36:50.607 --> 01:36:51.088]  And you know what?
[01:36:51.088 --> 01:36:55.169]  You would in the past when the establishment still had viewers and still had supporters.
[01:36:57.130 --> 01:36:58.550]  You don't anymore.
[01:36:58.550 --> 01:37:07.532]  Our reporters are going to be on the ground in McAllen at 1.30.
[01:37:07.532 --> 01:37:09.853]  So definitely look for that with Jakari Jackson.
[01:37:09.853 --> 01:37:15.014]  And what camera person went with him?
[01:37:15.014 --> 01:37:17.194]  Michael Zimmerman, what a great guy.
[01:37:17.194 --> 01:37:18.315]  And Adon Salazar.
[01:37:18.315 --> 01:37:19.375]  I'm glad Adon was able to go.
[01:37:22.510 --> 01:37:29.555]  I saw this story yesterday morning and I called Buckley and Doo up and I said, please, whatever team is ready to go, get them to the border.
[01:37:29.555 --> 01:37:33.618]  And then I'm not even exhausted an hour and 37 minutes in the broadcast.
[01:37:33.618 --> 01:37:38.561]  I just, I've talked a lot about this.
[01:37:38.561 --> 01:37:45.286]  When a certain constellation of news lines up and confirms 20 years of research, worse than we thought.
[01:37:51.835 --> 01:37:56.638]  It's kind of like calling in a family member to tell them that their mother or father died.
[01:37:56.638 --> 01:37:59.040]  Or that their son died.
[01:37:59.040 --> 01:38:03.363]  And I've had to give people the news of family deaths multiple times.
[01:38:03.363 --> 01:38:06.645]  It's not fun.
[01:38:06.645 --> 01:38:09.107]  But at the same time, this isn't like a family death.
[01:38:09.107 --> 01:38:11.408]  Well, it feels like that.
[01:38:11.408 --> 01:38:19.774]  Because knowing about this is what's going to allow us to reverse it and to stop it.
[01:38:23.643 --> 01:38:39.748]  But I've learned to psychoanalyze myself and realize that this news is all so sensational, all so over the top, all so incredible in how they roll out the most evil deception and just evil takeovers.
[01:38:39.748 --> 01:38:40.588]  Like it's no big deal.
[01:38:42.202 --> 01:38:45.903]  That I could take one of these stories and talk for 10 hours about it.
[01:38:45.903 --> 01:38:52.065]  You've seen me take a two-minute clip of Obama and talk for 30 minutes, just showing out each statement's a total lie from every angle.
[01:38:52.065 --> 01:39:02.708]  And the problem is my brain looks at one of these, watches one of these reports, and just explodes with all the connections and angles, and it's just... Trying to communicate this to the general public, I don't even know how you do it.
[01:39:02.708 --> 01:39:08.309]  I mean... Because it's so overwhelming, so obvious, so over-the-top.
[01:39:08.309 --> 01:39:10.510]  I likened it last hour to the police
[01:39:13.530 --> 01:39:18.293]  Fighting a dead body, let's say, in the back of a guy's car.
[01:39:18.293 --> 01:39:21.775]  Stereotypical, you know, people say, why do you say the back of a guy's car about a woman's car?
[01:39:21.775 --> 01:39:24.136]  Because men commit 98% of the murders, that's why.
[01:39:24.136 --> 01:39:24.956]  Stereotypical.
[01:39:24.956 --> 01:39:27.038]  Just like Muslims commit 98% of the terrorism.
[01:39:27.038 --> 01:39:29.279]  It's a fact, not a stereotype.
[01:39:29.279 --> 01:39:41.666]  But, cops pull some money over, they see blood and stuff in there, and a weapon, they search the car, probable cause, reasonable suspicion, and there's a dead body in the back, get a warrant for the house, find 20-something dead bodies in the basement.
[01:39:43.302 --> 01:39:47.204]  There's videos, you know, of the serial killer torturing the women to death, and this has happened many times.
[01:39:47.204 --> 01:39:49.405]  This is just one, you know, analogy.
[01:39:49.405 --> 01:39:59.390]  And it's like, I'm up here going, and here's this dead body, uh, poured with lime, and here's this skeleton we think you killed years before, and people are going, doesn't look like a body to me.
[01:39:59.390 --> 01:40:01.952]  Well, here's the videos of him torturing them.
[01:40:01.952 --> 01:40:03.312]  Oh, yeah, right, racist.
[01:40:03.312 --> 01:40:07.875]  You know, I mean, it's like world government out in the open, announcing world armies,
[01:40:09.693 --> 01:40:10.714]  Via the EU Army.
[01:40:10.714 --> 01:40:13.496]  We told people 20 years ago that was coming.
[01:40:13.496 --> 01:40:17.920]  That's been announced yesterday.
[01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:23.946]  UN armored vehicles of brand new construction being brought into the US and shipped everywhere all over the country.
[01:40:23.946 --> 01:40:32.213]  I mean, UN Abrams tanks, UN armored vehicles of the brand new construction.
[01:40:32.213 --> 01:40:35.736]  Just crazy town.
[01:40:35.736 --> 01:40:36.117]  I've got
[01:40:38.206 --> 01:40:42.769]  FEMA contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395% food prices.
[01:40:42.769 --> 01:40:50.855]  That's from Vice, which used to be a pretty good organization.
[01:40:50.855 --> 01:40:55.518]  I mean, now it's run by HBO and a bunch of trendies.
[01:40:55.518 --> 01:41:03.864]  Vice wanted to come interview me the last few months, a couple of times, and I just finally went, you know, I'd said yes at first, and I just said, you know what?
[01:41:03.864 --> 01:41:04.044]  No.
[01:41:06.325 --> 01:41:07.125]  It's like, why not?
[01:41:07.125 --> 01:41:07.846]  Are you scared?
[01:41:07.846 --> 01:41:09.907]  It's like, no, man, I just got stuff to do.
[01:41:09.907 --> 01:41:12.769]  I just, I don't want to sit here with some trendy guy.
[01:41:12.769 --> 01:41:15.150]  You believe in black helicopters and a world government?
[01:41:15.150 --> 01:41:17.791]  Aliens eating brains, huh?
[01:41:17.791 --> 01:41:18.852]  And you hate gay people.
[01:41:18.852 --> 01:41:21.493]  And I'm just like, I just don't have time for children anymore.
[01:41:21.493 --> 01:41:27.317]  I mean, you may think it's funny they put fluoride in the water to brain damage people.
[01:41:27.317 --> 01:41:29.518]  We even have the declassified documents.
[01:41:29.518 --> 01:41:31.179]  The White House science czar wrote a book about it.
[01:41:32.008 --> 01:41:36.391]  You may think it's funny them teaching school kids not to have a fat diet so their brains don't grow.
[01:41:36.391 --> 01:41:44.857]  It's the same thing as not having... 50% of formula should be fat.
[01:41:44.857 --> 01:41:46.178]  Healthy, clean fats.
[01:41:46.178 --> 01:41:46.558]  It's not.
[01:41:46.558 --> 01:41:47.919]  On average it's like 20%.
[01:41:47.919 --> 01:41:52.582]  The rest is high fructose corn syrup that causes massive brain damage, stupid!
[01:41:52.582 --> 01:41:54.123]  And that's why you are stupid!
[01:41:54.123 --> 01:41:56.065]  Because you never got milk!
[01:41:57.827 --> 01:42:02.530]  And I realize that they're a bunch of brain-dead zombies that just have like five things they say.
[01:42:02.530 --> 01:42:09.273]  You're a racist, you're a homophobe, you're a sexist, and you don't dress ironically.
[01:42:09.273 --> 01:42:12.995]  And I'm sorry, I'm a real intellectual.
[01:42:12.995 --> 01:42:17.658]  To the point, I talk in my real Texas accent and don't put on airs like you jackasses do.
[01:42:19.175 --> 01:42:21.917]  And I don't even want to cover this news.
[01:42:21.917 --> 01:42:24.439]  It's just unbelievably horrible.
[01:42:24.439 --> 01:42:27.241]  And it just confirms everything and what my gut's been telling me.
[01:42:27.241 --> 01:42:29.182]  And it's just like, give me a break, man.
[01:42:29.182 --> 01:42:33.044]  Do you yuppies really want global financial collapse?
[01:42:33.044 --> 01:42:34.425]  Do you understand it's by design?
[01:42:34.425 --> 01:42:38.088]  Do you know what a Great Depression will look like in this country?
[01:42:38.088 --> 01:42:42.291]  When it's filled with people like you, it's going to be hellish.
[01:42:45.762 --> 01:42:47.524]  Go watch The Grapes of Wrath.
[01:42:47.524 --> 01:42:50.006]  And that was with super hard-working Christian people.
[01:42:50.006 --> 01:42:53.009]  And that's based on composites and stuff that really went on.
[01:42:53.009 --> 01:43:01.317]  And it's horrible communist propaganda where they show up and the commie even looks like FDR and saves him and everything.
[01:43:01.317 --> 01:43:04.180]  But if you want to see what the Depression looked like, go watch that movie.
[01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:14.302]  And just armies of dumb, entitled socialist voters wanting free lunches.
[01:43:14.302 --> 01:43:20.184]  And when their plight's ten times worse in a few years, they'll never even remember or blame socialism.
[01:43:20.184 --> 01:43:21.305]  They'll demand even more.
[01:43:21.305 --> 01:43:22.565]  They'll demand communism.
[01:43:22.565 --> 01:43:23.586]  There's no end.
[01:43:23.586 --> 01:43:34.470]  And we'll have big mega-corporations, tax-exempt, behind armored fortress walls laughing at us as we're culturally devoured by drooling morons.
[01:43:40.708 --> 01:43:41.288]  Let me do this.
[01:43:41.288 --> 01:43:44.849]  Let me try to reset here for a moment.
[01:43:44.849 --> 01:43:52.270]  And then I'm going to come back and cover the UN military vehicles, World Net Daily.
[01:43:52.270 --> 01:43:55.211]  That ties in with Vice.
[01:43:55.211 --> 01:43:59.391]  FEMA contractor predicts social unrest in government report.
[01:43:59.391 --> 01:44:03.372]  395% food price hikes.
[01:44:03.372 --> 01:44:05.653]  And it's not like I'm just going with this FEMA report.
[01:44:05.653 --> 01:44:07.353]  We told you all this in 19...
[01:44:10.811 --> 01:44:10.892]  In 2007.
[01:44:14.949 --> 01:44:28.095]  And then we know the rest of the story, how the globalists admit they're engineering this financial collapse, but getting themselves positioned as the saviors with the many collapses around the world, so they're fully in position for a total takeover when they really drop the hammer.
[01:44:28.095 --> 01:44:42.042]  And we're desperately here trying to blame them for it, because they admittedly are who are behind it, because that's one of our only hopes to reverse it, because if they think they're politically going to get the blame, and if they think politically they're going to get brought down, they will be forced to back off.
[01:44:42.682 --> 01:44:48.366]  So I'm here trying to stop this for my own self-interest, for my own family.
[01:44:48.366 --> 01:44:58.513]  And I'm dealing with 50% of the public that literally doesn't know what planet they're on and can't find their butt with both hands.
[01:44:58.513 --> 01:45:00.014]  And that's why I'm frustrated.
[01:45:00.014 --> 01:45:01.295]  That's why I'm physically nauseous.
[01:45:02.708 --> 01:45:11.270]  Because during the break, I was just trying to go over all this news, get ready to come back and cover it, and I just, I've actually felt vomitous, and I just, I can't do, I cannot cover this, okay?
[01:45:11.270 --> 01:45:12.430]  I just can't do it anymore.
[01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:14.951]  Fine, everything's fine, everything's wonderful, okay?
[01:45:14.951 --> 01:45:29.714]  There's no world government, fluoride's good for you, the vaccines are good for you, GMO's good for you, radiation leaking's good for you, the liberals have told us, George Mambiot, the Guardian, it's all just freakazoid craziness.
[01:45:34.574 --> 01:45:42.440]  I mean, I got stacks of articles where the UN is suing people, taking over, advising police departments involved, setting up domestic spy grids.
[01:45:42.440 --> 01:45:45.642]  They've got the military training for gun confiscation, Army Times.
[01:45:45.642 --> 01:45:51.206]  I mean, they are really gearing up for some big stuff, and I'm hoping it doesn't all go to hell in a handbasket.
[01:45:51.206 --> 01:45:52.467]  I'm trying to stop it.
[01:45:52.467 --> 01:45:54.368]  Admitting we're in trouble stops it.
[01:45:54.368 --> 01:45:58.991]  Admitting Hitler's planning to start World War II could have stopped it.
[01:45:58.991 --> 01:46:02.454]  Admitting our government's trying to start war with Russia could stop it.
[01:46:04.244 --> 01:46:07.727]  These elites always become megalomaniacs and think they're invincible.
[01:46:07.727 --> 01:46:09.608]  And then they start wars they can't reverse.
[01:46:09.608 --> 01:46:15.533]  But back then we didn't have atomic weapons or hydrogen bombs or God knows what else they've developed.
[01:46:15.533 --> 01:46:19.536]  The Pentagon leaked 10 years ago they've got antimatter bombs.
[01:46:19.536 --> 01:46:28.143]  They're afraid to test them because they estimate it'd blow the entire planet up and turn it into a new asteroid belt.
[01:46:28.143 --> 01:46:30.425]  Maybe the entire solar system.
[01:46:32.128 --> 01:46:46.394]  And then they'll have some joke article in some White House-funded idiot group making fun of me for that statement when it was in the, it was in the MIT Quarterly, and it was in the San Francisco Chronicle!
[01:46:46.394 --> 01:46:50.716]  But you just joke about it like chimeras, I told you about 20 years ago.
[01:46:50.716 --> 01:46:51.776]  Now they admit.
[01:46:51.776 --> 01:46:54.357]  Human-animal splices.
[01:46:54.357 --> 01:46:58.159]  Again, I'm not up here on some frickin' high horse, man.
[01:46:58.159 --> 01:47:01.480]  This stuff is all battle plan for you and your family.
[01:47:04.224 --> 01:47:05.405]  I read this report right here.
[01:47:05.405 --> 01:47:13.591]  I'll come back and cover this, but FEMA contractor predicts social unrest caused by 395% food price spikes.
[01:47:13.591 --> 01:47:24.899]  The simulation titled Food Chain Reaction was desktop game exercise involving the participation of 65 officials, US, Europe, Africa, India, Brazil, and key multinational and intergovernmental institutions.
[01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:30.371]  And it goes on to basically say there's no way to stop it with the population and what's happened with food.
[01:47:30.371 --> 01:47:32.751]  And the globalists have done all this stuff to shut down food production.
[01:47:32.751 --> 01:47:37.272]  That's the post-industrial world they've set up.
[01:47:37.272 --> 01:47:40.092]  That's State Department Memorandum 200 from Henry Kissinger.
[01:47:40.092 --> 01:47:40.632]  Remember?
[01:47:40.632 --> 01:47:40.993]  1979?
[01:47:40.993 --> 01:47:45.933]  It was declassified in 79.
[01:47:45.933 --> 01:47:46.213]  It was from 1977.
[01:47:46.213 --> 01:47:46.854]  You can pull it up.
[01:47:46.854 --> 01:47:47.574]  It's declassified.
[01:47:47.574 --> 01:47:47.634]  CIA.
[01:47:56.340 --> 01:48:00.910]  Where he said the goal is to turn the food off and starve the third world and finally the west.
[01:48:00.910 --> 01:48:02.775]  He writes books calling military dumb animals.
[01:48:07.782 --> 01:48:09.824]  I mean, this is serious.
[01:48:09.824 --> 01:48:11.265]  This is serious, serious.
[01:48:11.265 --> 01:48:15.850]  They've got a plan, and boy, I see them getting it lined up, and I don't want to see it come through.
[01:48:15.850 --> 01:48:18.212]  By the way, this is how my brain works.
[01:48:18.212 --> 01:48:20.214]  Oh, we sell the highest quality, storable foods.
[01:48:20.214 --> 01:48:23.357]  The last 25 years, the lowest price out there at mfulworthstore.com.
[01:48:23.357 --> 01:48:24.158]  It's mfulworthselect.
[01:48:24.158 --> 01:48:25.959]  It's the full spectrum of my patronage supply.
[01:48:25.959 --> 01:48:28.742]  We sell it, the same stuff right next to it, just a little bit higher price.
[01:48:28.742 --> 01:48:29.302]  Already a great deal.
[01:48:30.163 --> 01:48:31.984]  And I think, boy, we're going to have a great depression.
[01:48:31.984 --> 01:48:32.925]  It's probably inevitable now.
[01:48:32.925 --> 01:48:35.606]  I need to raise more money to fund this operation through the depression.
[01:48:35.606 --> 01:48:37.067]  How am I going to do this?
[01:48:37.067 --> 01:48:40.168]  Plus, I need to get more storable food at the office and for my family.
[01:48:40.168 --> 01:48:42.289]  Plus, everybody needs to get this for themselves.
[01:48:42.289 --> 01:48:45.971]  So I'm going to show people this report and hope it gets them to buy food.
[01:48:45.971 --> 01:48:50.133]  The media would spend that and say opportunistically, he uses a FEMA report to get people to get food.
[01:48:50.133 --> 01:48:52.614]  Well, yeah, the ship's sinking.
[01:48:52.614 --> 01:48:53.455]  Get to a life raft.
[01:48:54.574 --> 01:48:55.614]  I hope you don't have to use it.
[01:48:55.614 --> 01:48:56.495]  I hope we're wrong.
[01:48:56.495 --> 01:48:57.535]  We're trying to stop it.
[01:48:57.535 --> 01:49:04.518]  But if you don't go to InfoWarsSelect.com or InfoWarsStore.com and get the high quality storable food, you are insane.
[01:49:04.518 --> 01:49:17.763]  If you don't get more guns and ammunition, if you don't learn how to use guns, if you haven't learned how to use them, if you don't have neighbors and friends you trust, and maybe a neighbor who's got a farm 50 miles outside town, believe me, if stuff collapses, it could get really bad.
[01:49:17.763 --> 01:49:19.464]  7 million people
[01:49:21.539 --> 01:49:22.799]  Multiple university studies.
[01:49:22.799 --> 01:49:23.299]  Look it up.
[01:49:23.299 --> 01:49:26.720]  Type in 7 million people starved during the Great Depression.
[01:49:26.720 --> 01:49:32.701]  They starved or died of illnesses resulting from malnutrition.
[01:49:32.701 --> 01:49:33.502]  7 million.
[01:49:33.502 --> 01:49:36.742]  We were 90% agrarian.
[01:49:36.742 --> 01:49:38.443]  We were 90% rural.
[01:49:38.443 --> 01:49:41.443]  And more than half those people were self-sufficient.
[01:49:41.443 --> 01:49:44.884]  So, more than half the country was self-sufficient and 7 million starved to death.
[01:49:44.884 --> 01:49:46.724]  7 million.
[01:49:46.724 --> 01:49:47.885]  7 million plus.
[01:49:50.913 --> 01:50:08.022]  Now you think about that, long and hard, because today we are, what is it, 89% urban, 11 to 10%, depending on which federal study, rural, and less than half of those people, 5% or less, are self-sufficient.
[01:50:08.022 --> 01:50:09.123]  My God.
[01:50:10.629 --> 01:50:22.616]  We've gone from 55% self-sufficient to less than 5% self-sufficient, and we are an immoral, degenerate, satanic nation that sells baby parts and keeps them alive to harvest them.
[01:50:22.616 --> 01:50:32.742]  We don't even care, and you imagine these drooling slobs running around acting trendy that are calling for our arrest and calling for the murder of gun owners, just cropping and begging at the feet of the globalists.
[01:50:32.742 --> 01:50:35.084]  I mean, they'll be the first people, the globalists.
[01:50:37.029 --> 01:50:37.730]  Shut down.
[01:50:37.730 --> 01:50:39.732]  But that's after they have a full takeover.
[01:50:39.732 --> 01:50:41.634]  Just drooling masses of nobodies.
[01:50:41.634 --> 01:50:43.176]  You have an authoritarian control.
[01:50:43.176 --> 01:50:45.198]  They're coming.
[01:50:45.198 --> 01:50:50.324]  You can really see this whole global system that'll make World War II look like nothing.
[01:50:50.324 --> 01:50:51.065]  They're trying to set up.
[01:50:51.065 --> 01:50:53.327]  And everyone's instincts tell them, get ready.
[01:50:53.327 --> 01:50:58.273]  Everybody's instincts are saying, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready, get ready.
[01:51:00.117 --> 01:51:01.317]  Are you prepared to bug out?
[01:51:01.317 --> 01:51:09.320]  Infidel Body Armor and an Army Ranger have produced a high-speed DVD and book to show you how to drive in combat, patrol, and how to survive in combat.

[01:51:40.094 --> 01:51:40.535]  I think so.
[01:51:59.577 --> 01:52:00.677]  Think about this.
[01:52:00.677 --> 01:52:13.262]  Your community's aging water infrastructure systems are very likely to be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, disinfection chemicals like ammonia, chlorine, and chloramines, and pharmaceuticals like statins, pain meds, and antidepressants.
[01:52:13.262 --> 01:52:17.283]  And no, water treatment plants are not equipped to filter these pharmaceutical toxins out.

[01:52:59.511 --> 01:53:07.657]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[01:53:07.657 --> 01:53:08.477]  Here's why.
[01:53:08.477 --> 01:53:12.600]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[01:53:12.600 --> 01:53:13.540]  So please listen.
[01:53:13.540 --> 01:53:17.223]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[01:53:17.223 --> 01:53:23.567]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[01:53:23.567 --> 01:53:27.650]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest,
[01:53:27.890 --> 01:53:30.832]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[01:53:30.832 --> 01:53:33.174]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[01:53:33.174 --> 01:53:37.997]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators.
[01:53:37.997 --> 01:53:44.721]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[01:53:44.721 --> 01:53:46.462]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[01:53:46.462 --> 01:53:48.143]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:53:48.143 --> 01:53:49.864]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:53:49.864 --> 01:53:53.727]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[01:53:53.727 --> 01:53:55.288]  Go to gridwars.com.
[01:53:55.288 --> 01:53:56.389]  That's gridwars.com.
[01:54:12.813 --> 01:54:18.557]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:54:18.557 --> 01:54:18.678]  3 p.m.
[01:54:18.678 --> 01:54:22.200]  Central, we're here live.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:28.245]  You know, I said I was going to take a bunch of calls today, but we're so booked with guests.
[01:54:28.245 --> 01:54:32.088]  I've got to probably just look at the guest list this week and scrub a bunch of people off of it.
[01:54:33.132 --> 01:54:35.695]  Because I want to take your calls.
[01:54:35.695 --> 01:54:40.400]  I want to hear from you about what you think about all these UN vehicles around the United States.
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:45.164]  What you think of FEMA government reports?
[01:54:45.164 --> 01:54:54.114]  Because that's actually what this is, is a report conducted with multinational governments and our own government with the occupational 10-state dictatorship that is FEMA.
[01:54:55.703 --> 01:55:02.130]  See, we come in with intros that say, from deep behind enemy lines in occupied Texas, broadcasting worldwide, Alex Jones.
[01:55:02.130 --> 01:55:11.700]  I have to come out and make those radical statements because it's so radical, what the globalists have done, people are basically caught blindside by it.
[01:55:12.998 --> 01:55:15.479]  They're dumbfounded because it just sounds so outrageous.
[01:55:15.479 --> 01:55:23.422]  Multinationals, we didn't vote to enter or running things, and the UN's making our laws, and multinational banks are tax-exempt and have diplomatic immunity.
[01:55:23.422 --> 01:55:25.303]  I mean, that's all on record.
[01:55:25.303 --> 01:55:28.904]  And they're now coming in and saying, you're not going to use the word mother and father.
[01:55:28.904 --> 01:55:31.165]  You're not going to have any real state authority.
[01:55:31.165 --> 01:55:32.445]  We're not going to let you have guns.
[01:55:32.445 --> 01:55:33.606]  It's a UN treaty.
[01:55:33.606 --> 01:55:39.168]  The UN says we're going to take more refugees from Latin America.
[01:55:39.168 --> 01:55:40.648]  And that's in ABC News!
[01:55:40.648 --> 01:55:41.809]  The UN says!
[01:55:43.902 --> 01:55:45.604]  Well, they're illegal, but the U.N.
[01:55:45.604 --> 01:55:47.505]  says so, Obama's allowed to do it.
[01:55:47.505 --> 01:55:52.190]  Doesn't matter what the Supreme Court says.
[01:55:52.190 --> 01:55:56.814]  The globalists, the Rockefellers, set up the U.N.
[01:55:56.814 --> 01:56:00.337]  in 1945 to set up world government.
[01:56:00.337 --> 01:56:04.041]  Go read the book written by David Rockefeller.
[01:56:04.041 --> 01:56:04.882]  Go read the charter.
[01:56:07.225 --> 01:56:12.808]  Oh, but all the movie stars and the beauty queens, you know, when you watch Miss America, oh, I want to be with the U.N.
[01:56:12.808 --> 01:56:14.549]  and UNICEF and help kids.
[01:56:14.549 --> 01:56:15.450]  People go, well, the U.N.
[01:56:15.450 --> 01:56:16.450]  must be this wonderful thing.
[01:56:16.450 --> 01:56:16.871]  The U.N.
[01:56:16.871 --> 01:56:18.311]  is hated all over the world.
[01:56:18.311 --> 01:56:20.493]  It runs sex slavery rings everywhere.
[01:56:20.493 --> 01:56:21.893]  Look it up.
[01:56:21.893 --> 01:56:23.054]  It runs drugs.
[01:56:23.054 --> 01:56:24.495]  It is the legion of death.
[01:56:27.927 --> 01:56:36.237]  And now they want to set up an EU army with the United Nations to quote, police the nations so they can't leave.
[01:56:36.237 --> 01:56:39.420]  They actually say that.
[01:56:39.420 --> 01:56:41.062]  And it's just not even news.
[01:56:41.062 --> 01:56:45.728]  Oh, they're going to set up a domestic army to arrest people that criticize the open borders.
[01:56:45.728 --> 01:56:46.409]  Isn't that great?
[01:56:48.319 --> 01:56:54.823]  And I've got stacks of news in the United States at airports where Muslims are attacking Christians and freaking out.
[01:56:54.823 --> 01:56:56.744]  Or where Muslims are attacking gays, they say.
[01:56:56.744 --> 01:56:58.145]  That's in the news today.
[01:56:58.145 --> 01:57:03.608]  Or where a woman goes into a Catholic church and desecrates Mary, a Muslim woman, and just flips out.
[01:57:03.608 --> 01:57:05.909]  These people kill each other in their own countries!
[01:57:05.909 --> 01:57:11.592]  They just police each other, get in everybody's faces, run around foaming at the mouth.
[01:57:11.592 --> 01:57:15.435]  And now in Germany, they're having to say, Oktoberfest has to be behind closed doors.
[01:57:16.397 --> 01:57:23.304]  Or you have to go through a checkpoint because the Muslims are coming in and attacking people.
[01:57:23.304 --> 01:57:34.475]  If they catch you in more than 11 Muslim nations kissing another man of your man or a woman of your woman, they kill you!
[01:57:34.475 --> 01:57:40.061]  If they rape your wife or daughter, it's her fault and they kill her!
[01:57:43.103 --> 01:57:45.865]  This is who our, quote, elite are bringing in.
[01:57:45.865 --> 01:57:56.631]  And then meanwhile... I'm going to shoot a special report on this for the Nightly News, but I'm going to do it.
[01:57:56.631 --> 01:58:00.153]  And I'm going to cover it some with Pchenik and others that are coming up.
[01:58:00.153 --> 01:58:02.294]  Pchenik pops up at 30 minutes and David Knight takes over.
[01:58:02.294 --> 01:58:05.296]  And Pchenik leaves us at the bottom of the hour.
[01:58:05.296 --> 01:58:07.097]  Is Pchenik on for an hour?
[01:58:09.554 --> 01:58:09.834]  30 minutes.
[01:58:09.834 --> 01:58:10.975]  I'm going to take some phone calls.
[01:58:10.975 --> 01:58:13.096]  We will just take nothing but phone calls at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:58:13.096 --> 01:58:14.978]  You can get lined up right now.
[01:58:14.978 --> 01:58:16.819]  First-time callers just on this food issue.
[01:58:16.819 --> 01:58:16.879]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:16.879 --> 01:58:16.959]  800-259-9231.
[01:58:16.959 --> 01:58:19.741]  The Brexit, all these global meltdowns, it's just out of control.
[01:58:19.741 --> 01:58:22.723]  The globalists always plan on having a global crisis.
[01:58:28.567 --> 01:58:31.269]  That would then bring in a greater EU dictatorship.
[01:58:31.269 --> 01:58:35.231]  But instead, it's causing nation-states to pull out because the Liberty Movement warned folks.
[01:58:35.231 --> 01:58:38.814]  So the point is, the elite aren't the only power in this universe.
[01:58:38.814 --> 01:58:40.375]  You have to take action, and you are.
[01:58:40.375 --> 01:58:42.156]  And we're starting to gain ground.
[01:58:42.156 --> 01:58:43.677]  We'll be back in 70 seconds.
[01:58:43.677 --> 01:58:44.938]  Let's just get Machinicon now.
[01:58:50.029 --> 01:58:59.496]  Please listen carefully because I'm about to point out three things that will save you a lot of money while you get high-quality products and fund the InfoWar, a 360 win.

[01:59:10.845 --> 01:59:13.987]  Because we hold back a surplus for AutoShip customers.
[01:59:13.987 --> 01:59:15.008]  Number three.
[01:59:15.008 --> 01:59:18.670]  We're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[01:59:18.670 --> 01:59:25.175]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the products that you need each month.

[01:59:32.960 --> 01:59:35.361]  As you know, I coined the term 360Win.
[01:59:35.361 --> 01:59:39.404]  And with the new AutoShip feature at InfoWarsLife.com, this is a sure win.
[01:59:41.125 --> 01:59:43.389]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show!
[02:00:14.625 --> 02:00:17.207]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:00:17.207 --> 02:00:36.579]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[02:00:36.579 --> 02:00:40.422]  I'll say this.
[02:00:40.422 --> 02:00:43.224]  The United States is sitting in a better position than many nations.
[02:00:45.168 --> 02:00:49.571]  But everything Obama is doing, and the globalists are doing, is trying to undermine the country.
[02:00:49.571 --> 02:00:51.492]  And I'm going to ask Dr. Pachinik this.
[02:00:51.492 --> 02:01:05.360]  If the elite are in control of Europe and the United States, they're successfully undermining Russia and China, but they're successfully undermining the American people as well, and the family, and trying to sabotage our own military.
[02:01:07.990 --> 02:01:09.170]  What is going on here?
[02:01:09.170 --> 02:01:19.353]  And Dr. Steve Pchenik of StevePchenik.com, he of course co-wrote books with Tom Clancy, he was involved in all sorts of clandestine operations, the head of psychological warfare for the State Department.
[02:01:19.353 --> 02:01:25.834]  You couldn't get a more informed patriotic insider on than a member of the Council on Foreign Relations until he resigned.
[02:01:25.834 --> 02:01:30.756]  He was one of the first prominent people to expose 9-11 as an inside job in early 2002.
[02:01:32.714 --> 02:01:35.237]  He exposed the whole Bin Laden hoax accurately.
[02:01:35.237 --> 02:01:36.859]  This is a short segment, long segment coming up.
[02:01:36.859 --> 02:01:38.761]  But Doc, you heard my question.
[02:01:38.761 --> 02:01:43.806]  I see his schizophrenic policies and I get the thing of funding all sides or whatever, but it seems to be beyond that.
[02:01:43.806 --> 02:01:52.035]  And I know there's lots of different factions, but why does our government do a lot of things that actually help American interest, but then other things that actually undermine our interest?
[02:01:52.035 --> 02:01:53.417]  Is that just different power structures?
[02:01:54.741 --> 02:02:08.091]  Well, it is, Alex, as usual, our government is very, very self-destructive, in part because it has become so large that one part literally does not know what the other part.
[02:02:08.091 --> 02:02:19.680]  For example, the CIA was supplying ammunition and guns to the so-called rebels who were fighting Bashar Assad, while the military was training others who were pro-Assad.
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:22.843]  I mean, it is so confusing, and that's why one of the reasons
[02:02:23.303 --> 02:02:29.509]  We need a president who's been vetted out completely, not just somebody who the CIA wanted up there.
[02:02:29.509 --> 02:02:40.840]  We need a president who understands what it is we're doing, where we're going, and has a coterie of experienced people who have been in crises before.
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:48.067]  Now, one of the greatest problems in this Brexit is the fact that our government didn't know at all that this was going to happen.
[02:02:48.687 --> 02:02:51.508]  Not only was it a binary decision, i.e.
[02:02:51.508 --> 02:03:08.653]  either England left or didn't leave, the country was so convinced and so self-delusional, as was Obama and Kerry, that they really didn't map out what would happen in case this was a situation, and in fact it caught them completely
[02:03:09.213 --> 02:03:13.938]  So they threatened to hold him hostage, their bluff got called, now things are disintegrating, they're in a lot of trouble.
[02:03:32.378 --> 02:03:33.379]  Well, that's correct.
[02:03:33.379 --> 02:03:38.683]  The good news is that God loves drunks and the United States.
[02:03:38.683 --> 02:03:55.676]  No matter what happens to us and no matter how incompetent our government is, and it's exceedingly incompetent for reasons that we can go into later on, probably because of the entrepreneurial nature of our people and because we're so large and we're blessed by two oceans.
[02:03:56.400 --> 02:03:58.802]  It really doesn't affect us.
[02:03:58.802 --> 02:04:03.426]  In reality, actually, if people are concerned, what I would say to them is to buy
[02:04:04.264 --> 02:04:11.830]  Stocks that give a dividend and are, you know, very secure because basically what you're doing is you're going along with the dollar.
[02:04:11.830 --> 02:04:17.775]  Going along with the dollar means that America can bet on the dollar being the supreme currency.
[02:04:17.775 --> 02:04:27.283]  And I want to go back to historical precedents where we had brilliant men during the World War II, not only Patton, Eisenhower,
[02:04:27.723 --> 02:04:33.609]  But we had a gentleman named Morgenthau, a German Jew who figured out very quickly in December of 1944
[02:04:35.569 --> 02:04:42.756]  That in order for America to be a really superpower, we have to denominate all current... All right, Dr. Pichai, this is powerful.
[02:04:42.756 --> 02:04:53.386]  I want you to start over, because this is so important, about Brexit, where you're coming from, where we're going, because I remember you on, five years ago, saying Europe is going to disintegrate.
[02:04:53.386 --> 02:04:55.828]  You watch, and then basically breaking this down.
[02:04:55.828 --> 02:04:58.531]  So let's talk about this arrogance and what that signifies.
[02:05:00.202 --> 02:05:08.772]  Both GOP nominee Donald Trump and leftist investor George Soros have predicted the complete downfall of the European Union, despite Trump being a nationalist and Soros a globalist.
[02:05:08.772 --> 02:05:18.584]  The two billionaires both independently declared that they believe a domino effect has been started by Britain's decision to leave the EU, and the process will be difficult for anyone to stop, as reported by Steve Watson.
[02:05:18.584 --> 02:05:19.445]  Soros said, quote,
[02:05:19.645 --> 02:05:25.351]  Now the catastrophic scenario that many feared has materialized, making the disintegration of the EU practically irreversible.
[02:05:25.351 --> 02:05:33.900]  Trump also predicted a complete breakup of the EU, and also warned that the continent would be completely unrecognizable within 10 years if strict immigration controls are not enacted.
[02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:35.121]  Trump told reporters, quote,
[02:05:41.147 --> 02:05:45.008]  Trump is referring to the resistance Scottish politicians are still giving Brexit.
[02:05:45.008 --> 02:05:47.509]  He continued, stating that, For more news, visit InfoWars.com.
[02:05:47.509 --> 02:05:48.569]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:05:59.887 --> 02:06:01.528]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[02:06:01.528 --> 02:06:03.008]  You can't survive without it.
[02:06:03.008 --> 02:06:04.208]  But where do you get it?

[02:06:10.190 --> 02:06:15.912]  The Alexa Pure Pro transforms water from virtually any fresh source into clean, healthy drinking water.
[02:06:16.112 --> 02:06:32.960]  Pairing the unprecedented superfiltration power of an all-new Gravity Block Core with a hybrid chromatic shell, it removes up to 99.999% of impurities, including bacteria, viruses, fluoride, disinfectants, volatile organic contaminants, and hormones.

[02:06:35.863 --> 02:06:37.324]  Stainless steel construction.

[02:06:39.286 --> 02:06:41.368]  Replacement filters are simple to install.

[02:06:59.203 --> 02:07:07.949]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:07:07.949 --> 02:07:08.770]  Here's why.
[02:07:08.770 --> 02:07:12.912]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[02:07:12.912 --> 02:07:13.853]  So please listen.
[02:07:13.853 --> 02:07:17.275]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:07:17.535 --> 02:07:23.896]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:07:23.896 --> 02:07:31.218]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:07:31.218 --> 02:07:33.558]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:07:33.558 --> 02:07:44.820]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast-charge solar generators, and they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[02:07:45.140 --> 02:07:46.882]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[02:07:46.882 --> 02:07:48.564]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:07:48.564 --> 02:07:50.305]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:07:50.305 --> 02:07:54.169]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[02:07:54.169 --> 02:07:55.730]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:07:55.730 --> 02:07:57.092]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:08:13.098 --> 02:08:21.586]  The world is a dangerous place, not because of evil, but because of those who look on and do nothing.
[02:08:21.586 --> 02:08:25.930]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:08:25.930 --> 02:08:30.114]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center.
[02:08:30.114 --> 02:08:31.736]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:08:34.670 --> 02:08:36.130]  And we talk about a command center.
[02:08:36.130 --> 02:08:37.591]  We are under FEMA.
[02:08:37.591 --> 02:08:40.291]  We are under this whole corporate global model.
[02:08:40.291 --> 02:08:42.652]  And the people of Europe have discovered that.
[02:08:42.652 --> 02:08:44.272]  Eight nations want to leave the Euro.
[02:08:44.272 --> 02:08:46.073]  It's dictatorial.
[02:08:46.073 --> 02:08:51.254]  We have the Brexit that Obama and others and Hillary, you know, said, oh, you know, they'll never leave.
[02:08:51.254 --> 02:08:55.515]  To me, it seems like a big defeat for globalism.
[02:08:55.515 --> 02:08:57.376]  And it seems like they were caught flat-footed.
[02:08:58.615 --> 02:09:11.219]  But Dr. Steve Pachinick, former member of the Council on Foreign Relations, best-selling author, one of the founders of General Boykin and others of Delta Force, that's on record, the guy that ran the Camp David Accords, I mean, his pedigree is just that amazing.
[02:09:11.219 --> 02:09:18.681]  You can just Google his name and, you know, he can't talk about too much, the Justice Department will come call him into court again, like happens when he comes on the show routinely.
[02:09:19.341 --> 02:09:24.949]  Now, because of how secretive, you know, all this stuff is he's been involved in overthrowing countries, stopping the overthrow of countries.
[02:09:24.949 --> 02:09:26.050]  I mean, that's on record.
[02:09:26.050 --> 02:09:28.714]  So he's the real deal with a lot of talkers out there.
[02:09:28.714 --> 02:09:30.797]  And I tell you, he really predicted...
[02:09:31.798 --> 02:09:34.319]  Four years ago, after Benghazi, what would happen?
[02:09:34.319 --> 02:09:37.280]  We're going to go in, we're going to block these Saudi guys.
[02:09:37.280 --> 02:09:39.421]  Other people are trying to double-cross us, we're going to stop them.
[02:09:39.421 --> 02:09:41.061]  That all came out is what happened.
[02:09:41.061 --> 02:09:44.203]  I got other sources that are public, others that aren't, that concurred.
[02:09:44.203 --> 02:09:50.365]  And so, I'm just letting you know, he gives us really good intelligence over and over and over and over again.
[02:09:51.997 --> 02:09:53.939]  And so what does this British exit mean?
[02:09:53.939 --> 02:09:56.321]  Sure, there's going to be shenanigans to try to keep folks in it.
[02:09:56.321 --> 02:10:01.646]  I'm not against some union if it's democratic and empowers people and is just economic.
[02:10:01.646 --> 02:10:13.577]  But when it's arresting people that criticize open borders, when it's totalitarian and wants to arrest global warming deniers, like the Democratic Party platform officially says today, then we know this is an authoritarian movement.
[02:10:14.258 --> 02:10:19.362]  By the big banks, through the Democrats and the Republicans, through the Labor, through the Tory.
[02:10:19.362 --> 02:10:20.984]  And this is really an awakening moment.
[02:10:20.984 --> 02:10:28.270]  But talking to Pachanik, who just joined us, he started getting into the fact that it shows the ineptitude, the arrogance, the flat-footedness.
[02:10:28.270 --> 02:10:28.971]  And I agree.
[02:10:28.971 --> 02:10:35.376]  Look at the Euro bureaucracy that's unelected, but set up from the start to rule it, because it started as a coal and steel collective.
[02:10:35.376 --> 02:10:38.999]  I mean, it started out as a technocracy, folks.
[02:10:38.999 --> 02:10:39.800]  It didn't just become one.
[02:10:41.371 --> 02:10:44.792]  They're saying we're just going to have an EU army and it's going to take over your militaries.
[02:10:44.792 --> 02:10:46.173]  We're going to start commanding them.
[02:10:46.173 --> 02:10:47.974]  The bureaucracy is going to put out a report.
[02:10:47.974 --> 02:10:50.675]  We're going to bring in new commanders over your commanders.
[02:10:50.675 --> 02:10:53.736]  Folks, that is literal occupation.
[02:10:53.736 --> 02:10:58.718]  That is like Hitler coming in and putting his French generals in over the French, the Vichy.
[02:10:59.458 --> 02:11:01.359]  I mean, I harp on that because it's what's happening.
[02:11:01.359 --> 02:11:04.100]  This is so crazy, I can't even believe it.
[02:11:04.100 --> 02:11:10.943]  And globalist policies trying to jack up food prices worldwide, trying to bring in a crisis where these guys consolidate control.
[02:11:10.943 --> 02:11:14.705]  But what if they bring in a crisis so big it brings them down?
[02:11:14.705 --> 02:11:18.286]  By the way, I'm not sure licking my lips wanting to see the whole system crash.
[02:11:18.286 --> 02:11:26.750]  I want these evil globalists at the top to stop wrecking things and basing things on conquest and collapse instead of renaissance.
[02:11:27.685 --> 02:11:30.589]  So I'm not looking for some civil war.
[02:11:30.589 --> 02:11:35.235]  I'm not looking to, you know, just see Herman Von Ruppe and Merkel's head on a platter.
[02:11:36.118 --> 02:11:39.960]  I just realized these people aren't as smart as Napoleon or Hitler.
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:41.540]  They were bad guys, by the way.
[02:11:41.540 --> 02:11:48.923]  Weren't as smart as people before them, and they just think they're invincible because they're in control, and it gets more and more dangerous.
[02:11:48.923 --> 02:11:53.805]  So to cover the waterfront, and one at a time we have is Dr. Steve Pachenik, stevepachenik.com.
[02:11:53.805 --> 02:12:03.269]  Let's walk through this history, where we are, and then I want to ask you about the global economic system, because we got FEMA reports and others saying worldwide food crises, you name it.
[02:12:03.269 --> 02:12:04.490]  Is that hype or what's going on?
[02:12:05.871 --> 02:12:19.590]  I think it's important for the audience to understand we Americans, in 1944, because of the incredible quality of leaders that we had at that point under FDR,
[02:12:20.490 --> 02:12:34.866]  Morgenthau and others in the Treasury developed what was called the Bretton Woods Conference, which basically stated very clearly that for the next half a century to a century, we will have the dollar denominated as the currency of the world.
[02:12:35.603 --> 02:12:46.627]  That became so ingrained that anybody who has a chance to go to New Hampshire, Mount Washington should see that little room which determined the outcome of American superpower.
[02:12:46.627 --> 02:12:53.109]  It was not only our army, it was the brilliance of men who could foresee what would happen to our country.
[02:12:53.109 --> 02:12:54.650]  Now, taking that forward,
[02:12:55.333 --> 02:12:58.816]  The French came in after World War II, although they were defeated.
[02:12:58.816 --> 02:13:02.558]  My father was in the French Army, and the first order he got was retreat.
[02:13:02.558 --> 02:13:06.221]  And unfortunately, 2.2 million men retreated.
[02:13:06.221 --> 02:13:17.850]  The reality is that France, after World War II, said to the Americans that we have to co-authorize Germany, because France had been defeated twice by the Germans in World War I and II.
[02:13:17.850 --> 02:13:21.973]  So they came together on this theoretical notion, which was total nonsense,
[02:13:22.393 --> 02:13:27.139]  To co-opt the Germans by creating a United States of Europe.
[02:13:27.139 --> 02:13:39.814]  That in turn had no legitimacy, it had no concrete basis, and as Alex told you, it basically was a bunch of bureaucrats ironically put in the worst country of all, which was not really a country, Belgium.
[02:13:40.595 --> 02:13:47.337]  At the site where Napoleon was defeated in 1815, only five days before the Brexit.
[02:13:47.337 --> 02:13:52.718]  So in a way, history recapitulates itself when England and Germany defeated France.
[02:13:52.718 --> 02:13:55.638]  What this is, is the end of globalization.
[02:13:55.638 --> 02:14:02.900]  For five to ten years, I've been saying that the so-called notion of globalization is artificial and not real.
[02:14:02.900 --> 02:14:07.021]  Because what was happening is the big banks on Wall Street were in fact
[02:14:07.521 --> 02:14:08.462]  We're good to go.
[02:14:26.144 --> 02:14:27.085]  They're very safe.
[02:14:27.085 --> 02:14:35.551]  So Americans should understand your local regional banks are fine because of the reserve currencies that were mandated after 2008.
[02:14:35.551 --> 02:14:49.621]  What happened is the Goldman Sachs, the Morgan Stanley's, the big unfortunate banks and the corrupt ones now had to put in their own tentacles into the different countries as opposed to going through Britain.
[02:14:50.473 --> 02:15:02.739]  Our country did not in any way anticipate that this was happening, despite the fact that I would write repeatedly, both in Cyber Command, Cyber Warfare, and the Netforce series by Tom Clancy.
[02:15:02.739 --> 02:15:09.002]  I wrote about it in Op Center when Spain broke out and Barcelona broke away from Spain.
[02:15:09.002 --> 02:15:16.105]  I kept saying it for five years on the Alex Jones Show, that this was the beginning of the end of Europe, because Europe
[02:15:16.565 --> 02:15:20.670]  It's an artificial construct that has no basis for solidity.
[02:15:20.670 --> 02:15:25.977]  It's different national characters, 28 to 29, with one currency.
[02:15:25.977 --> 02:15:33.286]  The difference is the United States has one currency for 52 states and we're unified because it's a republic.
[02:15:33.846 --> 02:15:42.953]  There may be attempts at a secession, like Texas or others, but I don't think it will be successful as opposed to devolution of power.
[02:15:42.953 --> 02:15:54.441]  So what I've really been talking about, and Alex really pointed this out over the years, is not that the globalists were increasing, it's that we have a devolution of power going on all over the world.
[02:15:54.941 --> 02:16:01.305]  Including the Chinese who have the centralized power but are fighting their own corruption in the local areas.
[02:16:01.305 --> 02:16:02.845]  The Yuan is going down.
[02:16:02.845 --> 02:16:04.987]  China will not do well in this.
[02:16:04.987 --> 02:16:12.311]  They will try to attempt to make the Yuan a currency that's an alternate to the American currency of the British Pound.
[02:16:12.311 --> 02:16:13.451]  That will not happen.
[02:16:13.451 --> 02:16:15.692]  The Pound will still remain strong.
[02:16:15.692 --> 02:16:20.355]  The Euro will fall repeatedly because France has a very low growth rate.
[02:16:20.815 --> 02:16:26.501]  And it had before France even attempted to stop the Brexit, it already had riots.
[02:16:26.501 --> 02:16:30.105]  What's the calculus on bringing in all the refugees?
[02:16:30.105 --> 02:16:31.687]  Five million from the Middle East?
[02:16:31.687 --> 02:16:34.830]  It's gotta be hundreds of thousands if not millions here that are covering it up.
[02:16:34.830 --> 02:16:39.996]  What is the whole point of bringing in people unskilled, 22% that have TB?
[02:16:39.996 --> 02:16:41.057]  I mean this sounds like treason.
[02:16:42.478 --> 02:16:51.963]  The way I looked at it and the way I said it on your show many years ago was that this was Putin's revenge on the takedown of the Soviet Union.
[02:16:51.963 --> 02:16:56.005]  When I listened to Putin many years ago, he's a very clever man.
[02:16:56.005 --> 02:17:02.609]  He said, imagine what countries are like when you liberate 20 million people and they have no country, i.e.
[02:17:02.609 --> 02:17:06.431]  addressing me and others who are involved in the takedown of the Soviet Union.
[02:17:06.431 --> 02:17:08.632]  And I realized that he would, in fact,
[02:17:09.471 --> 02:17:20.059]  Get into the Syrian war to create this conflagration, support Bashar Assad with Iran, and then allow all of these young men to transfer over into Turkey.
[02:17:20.059 --> 02:17:26.905]  Sure, and of course, he came out yesterday, Putin, and said this reminds him of the fall of the Soviet Union.
[02:17:26.905 --> 02:17:27.825]  Oh, I didn't know that.
[02:17:27.825 --> 02:17:32.169]  You see, I had anticipated it, and I warned our people, but again, they didn't listen.
[02:17:32.854 --> 02:17:40.018]  Again, our people, you know, this is the point why you are important and why the American public has come to listen to you.
[02:17:40.018 --> 02:17:43.140]  We've talked about this for years beforehand.
[02:17:43.140 --> 02:17:46.602]  I knew our government was not qualified to answer this.
[02:17:46.602 --> 02:17:53.926]  I knew our government was not even capable of anticipating any of these problems and gaming them out.
[02:17:53.926 --> 02:17:59.248]  Unlike the Nixon administration, whatever you could say for Nixon, right or wrong, the man was brilliant.
[02:17:59.248 --> 02:18:01.890]  He knew exactly how to game out the Chinese,
[02:18:02.418 --> 02:18:03.419]  I don't think so.
[02:18:20.137 --> 02:18:24.201]  Well, in effect, Alex, there is no more sovereignty, and they have no power.
[02:18:24.201 --> 02:18:30.587]  What you saw Obama doing was to really, again, basically self-destruct.
[02:18:30.587 --> 02:18:38.434]  He self-destructed with Osama bin Laden nonsense, which didn't exist, the shooting, with Sandy Hook, a false flag, with another false flag.
[02:18:38.434 --> 02:18:41.997]  So he will be known as the sociopath that he is.
[02:18:41.997 --> 02:18:43.659]  I said it from the day he came in.
[02:18:44.219 --> 02:18:55.251]  He was a CIA recruit, a complete sociopath, whose only advantage was... Hey, we know current FBI agents that have investigated Sandy Hook and think it's a hoax.
[02:18:55.251 --> 02:18:56.472]  I mean, it's incredible.
[02:18:56.472 --> 02:18:57.393]  I'm not going to get into it.
[02:18:57.393 --> 02:19:06.302]  Not only that, the question is, what do we do when we know that our government is tyrannical and is capable of killing us and shooting us?
[02:19:06.855 --> 02:19:08.376]  It's not just FEMA.
[02:19:08.376 --> 02:19:12.717]  The question is, really, when will we protest, and how will that protest?
[02:19:12.717 --> 02:19:16.339]  But isn't it clear that it's a criminal element inside our government?
[02:19:16.339 --> 02:19:18.120]  Well, the government is criminal.
[02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:21.421]  I mean, how do you allow our government to attack
[02:19:22.085 --> 02:19:37.595]  The Twin Towers when you have the CIA, the DIA, the military intelligence, you have the soldiers, you have the police, you have Homeland Security, you have the wasp-trained Mueller who says, oh no, we didn't know about it, and the FBI, the most
[02:19:38.315 --> 02:19:40.598]  And why are they allowing the Islamic invasion?
[02:19:40.598 --> 02:19:43.320]  Just so they can have more terror attacks and get more funding?
[02:19:43.320 --> 02:19:45.703]  I'm going to ask you that when we come back.
[02:19:45.703 --> 02:19:47.024]  Our Steve Pachinix, our guest, analyzing the Brexit.

[02:24:15.754 --> 02:24:17.135]  I was going to take calls the next segment.
[02:24:17.135 --> 02:24:17.756]  You know what I forgot?
[02:24:17.756 --> 02:24:24.042]  We've got a reporter down in the valley where they're admittedly bringing in illegal aliens and putting them on buses.
[02:24:24.042 --> 02:24:25.183]  Now we broke that two years ago.
[02:24:25.183 --> 02:24:26.645]  Nobody else covered it.
[02:24:26.645 --> 02:24:27.386]  And that's a big deal.
[02:24:27.386 --> 02:24:28.347]  It shows the lawlessness.
[02:24:28.347 --> 02:24:30.169]  But now it's on ABC News.
[02:24:30.169 --> 02:24:31.950]  So we thought we'd go back down there and show folks.
[02:24:32.682 --> 02:24:35.844]  So, Jakari Jackson, Don Salazar and others joining us.
[02:24:35.844 --> 02:24:39.185]  Caught red-handed, Border Patrol paying to ship illegals deep in the United States.
[02:24:39.185 --> 02:24:40.406]  This is the lawlessness.
[02:24:40.406 --> 02:24:44.808]  Look at the Sunday Express headline, European Superstate to be unveiled.
[02:24:44.808 --> 02:24:49.930]  EU, we told you this last week, EU nations to be, quote, morphed into one post-Brexit.
[02:24:49.930 --> 02:24:51.831]  So you don't have an excuse to leave now.
[02:24:51.831 --> 02:24:52.832]  We'll fix that problem.
[02:24:53.712 --> 02:24:57.053]  So this shows the incredible totalitarian nature.
[02:24:57.053 --> 02:25:01.274]  And obviously this will just accelerate people wanting to leave even more.
[02:25:01.274 --> 02:25:03.195]  But what is it about tyrants, Dr. Pucinich?
[02:25:03.195 --> 02:25:04.395]  They just don't get it.
[02:25:04.395 --> 02:25:10.877]  It's like Catalonia or Catalan, one of the only prosperous areas in Spain, its own culture.
[02:25:10.877 --> 02:25:13.758]  97% of people voted to leave.
[02:25:13.758 --> 02:25:14.958]  Madrid said you can't.
[02:25:14.958 --> 02:25:16.218]  They just said we'll do whatever we want.
[02:25:16.218 --> 02:25:18.179]  I mean, how do you stop 90%?
[02:25:18.179 --> 02:25:20.680]  You can't control 90% and make them do what you want.
[02:25:20.680 --> 02:25:21.540]  You can only kill them.
[02:25:25.276 --> 02:25:35.327]  Yeah, the reason I knew Catalonia would break away from Madrid, number one, Madrid is an artificial construct created by Francis II, a French king.
[02:25:35.327 --> 02:25:36.428]  There is no Spain.
[02:25:36.428 --> 02:25:42.075]  It's really Valencia, Basque, Barcelona, as you know, and I wrote about Catalan breaking away.
[02:25:42.771 --> 02:25:51.794]  The problem in Spain will be that it had a civil war during the 30s, millions died, and it could have another civil war, because the Catalans are not Spanish.
[02:25:51.794 --> 02:25:58.197]  They will fight if they have to, and Madrid doesn't have a national force that can really counteract it.
[02:25:58.197 --> 02:26:04.799]  What happens to tyrants is they see the, you know, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.
[02:26:04.799 --> 02:26:09.661]  But in that premise, what people don't realize, it's the beginning of the end of the tyrant.
[02:26:10.203 --> 02:26:22.852]  The minute the tyrant exercises that kind of absolute power like Obama's doing, like those henchmen around him, then it becomes the end of their dynasty and then the end of their tenure.
[02:26:22.852 --> 02:26:23.732]  What happens?
[02:26:23.732 --> 02:26:33.439]  Putin understands very well in the history of the Romanovs and the Tsars and Stalin, the only way the tyrants leave is through assassination or death.
[02:26:33.439 --> 02:26:34.940]  There is no other way.
[02:26:34.940 --> 02:26:39.603]  In the United States, we either assassinate our presidents, which we've done with LBJ,
[02:26:40.444 --> 02:26:51.439]  We had shootings, which we did with JFK, and we warned LBJ not to continue, and we told Reagan that he has a problem, and then we went on and so forth.
[02:26:51.439 --> 02:26:54.544]  Things just don't happen by chance or accident.
[02:26:55.114 --> 02:26:57.115]  Now we have a corrupt government.
[02:26:57.115 --> 02:26:58.696]  We have an inept government.
[02:26:58.696 --> 02:27:03.159]  That's worse, because corruption may be needed in order to get systems going.
[02:27:03.159 --> 02:27:05.180]  It's just a degree of corruption.
[02:27:05.180 --> 02:27:17.687]  But when you have incompetence to the top, Susan Rice, Samantha Power, the Ben Rhodes, all those people who really have no idea what they're doing, and they stood in one of those think tanks, it's time to get rid of all of them.
[02:27:19.491 --> 02:27:37.295]  You know, attempt to come into the presidency is far more important than people realize, not only because he said the system is rigged, but he clearly articulated in words what you have been doing, what I have been doing, and many millions of others have said we're disgusted with the rigged system.
[02:27:37.295 --> 02:27:39.535]  Nevertheless, the rigged system continues.
[02:27:39.535 --> 02:27:43.296]  If Hillary comes in, my suspicion is there will be violence.
[02:27:44.208 --> 02:27:58.020]  I, you know, I can't proffer it, but they know, the people who are listening to me, that they were more than effective in handing me subpoenas, or when they felt I was out of control, they sent helicopters above my house.
[02:27:58.604 --> 02:27:59.745]  To give me a warning.
[02:27:59.745 --> 02:28:07.210]  Now, I don't have a problem fighting again for my nation and our republic because I had to fight overseas.
[02:28:07.210 --> 02:28:10.072]  But I call on our military to wake up.
[02:28:10.072 --> 02:28:14.916]  I call on our generals to stop worrying about their pensions and their liability.
[02:28:14.916 --> 02:28:20.440]  Right now, we have more generals who are on pension than active duty military officers.
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:21.381]  And that's a crime.
[02:28:21.961 --> 02:28:26.164]  And instead, we don't have an army that really is loyal to the Republic.
[02:28:26.164 --> 02:28:30.666]  What the Republic did and Obama did was a very shrewd and clever element.
[02:28:30.666 --> 02:28:41.833]  They create strategic tension all over the world so that our military is deployed, not because they have to fight for the Republic, but it's a way of getting rid of our military domestically.
[02:28:41.833 --> 02:28:44.615]  So we're in 786 bases.
[02:28:44.615 --> 02:28:46.956]  Then you asked, why are these false flags occurring?
[02:28:47.529 --> 02:29:01.939]  You hit it on the head repeatedly when you said it was to round up our ammunition and guns, but there's a more serious reason and a more perfidious reason that I have maintained throughout, and that is what I wrote in the State of Emergency.
[02:29:01.939 --> 02:29:08.923]  Our government can no longer justify its existence without creating strategic tension within our country.
[02:29:08.923 --> 02:29:09.544]  In other words,
[02:29:10.004 --> 02:29:14.009]  The federal government, sui generis, has no legitimacy.
[02:29:14.009 --> 02:29:18.695]  It has to create strategic tension so that it can mandate its federal troops.
[02:29:18.695 --> 02:29:21.799]  Sure, it has to make itself the hero and violate jurisdictions.
[02:29:21.799 --> 02:29:28.787]  If you could do like four more minutes on the other side, I want to ask you, not as a pop psychiatrist, but also a medical doctor, Harvard and MIT trained,
[02:29:29.548 --> 02:29:35.914]  I want to ask you just briefly about a Merkel, about an Obama, about, I mean, who these people are, why they're so dishonorable.
[02:29:35.914 --> 02:29:38.876]  Why, I mean, the most scummiest people get in power.
[02:29:38.876 --> 02:29:39.937]  Stay right there, Dr. Petranek.
[02:29:39.937 --> 02:29:40.838]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:40.838 --> 02:29:49.266]  And then Jakari Jackson, Don Salazar, and other reporters in the Valley, where the UN is ordering and directing unnamed migrants to just be let in.
[02:29:49.266 --> 02:29:50.647]  We're on the march.
[02:29:50.647 --> 02:29:53.189]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:53.189 --> 02:29:55.872]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:29:59.023 --> 02:29:59.618]  No problem.
[02:30:00.478 --> 02:30:03.560]  Finally, the mainstream media is reporting on what we broke two years ago.
[02:30:03.560 --> 02:30:04.101]  The U.S.
[02:30:04.101 --> 02:30:11.526]  Customs and Border Patrol, under pressure from the Obama administration, is purchasing bus tickets for illegals to ship them deeper into the country at taxpayers' expense.
[02:30:11.526 --> 02:30:23.455]  Local news station KRGV is now covering how the McAllen, Texas bus station is used as a transit hub for illegals Obama is bringing into the country, which Infowars.com exclusively broke in 2014 when no one else dared to report on it.
[02:30:23.455 --> 02:30:28.158]  KRGV has revealed that over 100 illegals a day are being dropped off at the McAllen station.
[02:30:28.158 --> 02:30:28.358]  And, in 2014,
[02:30:29.719 --> 02:30:35.904]  InfoWars reported on how the Obama administration was ordering the Border Patrol to release illegals they've apprehended after crossing the border.
[02:30:35.904 --> 02:30:44.932]  But, as part of their release, the illegals are transported to the McAllen bus station by Border Patrol agents, who then buy them tickets to go wherever they want to go in the U.S.
[02:30:44.932 --> 02:30:48.776]  So, for example, if the illegals have relatives in Boston, that's where they get to go.
[02:30:48.776 --> 02:30:51.918]  And taxpayers are paying for this illegal smuggling operation.
[02:30:51.918 --> 02:30:55.802]  To find out more about Obama's lawlessness, visit InfoWars.com.
[02:30:55.802 --> 02:30:57.103]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[02:30:59.853 --> 02:31:03.054]  A clean, toxic-free body is the foundation of true health.
[02:31:03.054 --> 02:31:05.414]  Deep Cleanze by Infowarslife.com.

[02:32:33.030 --> 02:32:41.293]  No one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[02:32:41.293 --> 02:32:46.695]  Just one of the key compounds, BioPQQ, is backed by major clinical studies.

[02:33:13.206 --> 02:33:19.491]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:36.710 --> 02:33:37.731]  Welcome back.
[02:33:37.731 --> 02:33:43.998]  Jakari Jackson and others are getting in place down in South Texas in McAllen, where the UN's running the illegal alien invasion.
[02:33:43.998 --> 02:33:45.379]  They're actually selling the news.
[02:33:45.379 --> 02:33:50.324]  The UN advised us, the UN comes in, they're illegal, and then we just put them on buses and ship them wherever they want.
[02:33:51.164 --> 02:34:01.669]  But when I came in from Isla Mujeres, took my children fishing for five, six days, they interrogated every one of them and asked them, what'd you buy, what'd you do, where'd you go?
[02:34:01.669 --> 02:34:03.189]  And the guy knew full well who I was.
[02:34:03.189 --> 02:34:08.572]  Had a big X on my little, you know, computer printout when I went through that first.
[02:34:08.572 --> 02:34:12.854]  And as it does every time, and I got to be interrogated.
[02:34:12.854 --> 02:34:15.215]  But if I didn't wear a burka over my head, there wouldn't be any problem.
[02:34:16.363 --> 02:34:25.933]  And again, I'm not here to start some war with the Muslims, but if I could point out they've got rights I don't have, and that this whole thing's security theater, maybe I could get my freedoms back.
[02:34:25.933 --> 02:34:34.122]  Because all I see with this police state is domesticating me, that I have no rights, I have no freedoms, and I need to worship some all-powerful centralized government.
[02:34:35.387 --> 02:34:44.779]  And that's why I'm trying to get people self-sufficient, I'm trying to get folks to take action, and get involved in their communities, to take back our nation by being productive, by being honorable.
[02:34:44.779 --> 02:34:47.342]  Now, we're going to go to our reporters here in a few minutes, but Dr. Pachinik...
[02:34:48.571 --> 02:34:52.074]  Again, you're not just a pop psychologist, you're not just a psychiatrist.
[02:34:52.074 --> 02:34:55.297]  Harvard-trained, MIT, politics, you name it.
[02:34:55.297 --> 02:35:01.582]  I'm going to go over your whole pedigree for listeners, but it's very extensive, obviously, and they can't stand the fact you come on the show.
[02:35:01.582 --> 02:35:05.906]  I've been visited by the government about it, you've been visited, and then people say, well, why don't you tell us all about it?
[02:35:05.906 --> 02:35:09.809]  Well, you did put the subpoena online and talk about it and go through it all.
[02:35:09.809 --> 02:35:12.131]  I just sit there and just leave it where it's at.
[02:35:12.671 --> 02:35:16.052]  And just laugh at people, basically, because all I'm doing is basic good stuff.
[02:35:16.052 --> 02:35:16.632]  I'm a good guy.
[02:35:16.632 --> 02:35:19.853]  And, you know, trying to save this country, because I live here.
[02:35:19.853 --> 02:35:20.593]  My kids live here.
[02:35:20.593 --> 02:35:22.593]  And, you know, my ancestors lived here.
[02:35:22.593 --> 02:35:26.374]  And I just really, you know, don't have it out for the average person.
[02:35:26.374 --> 02:35:28.735]  I just want to have a free nation.
[02:35:28.735 --> 02:35:33.516]  But look at the psychology of the sycophants, the Obamas, the Hillarys, and others.
[02:35:33.516 --> 02:35:36.617]  I mean, they just want to mount America's head on the wall.
[02:35:36.617 --> 02:35:37.977]  They really are after the bitter clingers.
[02:35:37.977 --> 02:35:40.618]  They really hate people that are independent.
[02:35:41.278 --> 02:35:42.479]  Of any race, color, or creed.
[02:35:42.479 --> 02:35:58.985]  I mean, they really do want to physically dominate what was Americana, even though that's what ends up generating the power of the nation that these parasites basically control and siphon off of and ride to global control.
[02:35:58.985 --> 02:36:05.047]  So I don't understand the schizophrenic behavior or the self-destructive behavior of them just seeming like they're out to get us.
[02:36:05.047 --> 02:36:07.648]  I mean, they even say they are when their internal memos come out.
[02:36:08.708 --> 02:36:09.649]  A, is that correct?
[02:36:09.649 --> 02:36:18.892]  In just a few minutes on the psychology of these people, as somebody that wrote the book on State Department psychological operations, who helped get the Camp David Accord done, and so much more.
[02:36:18.892 --> 02:36:22.433]  I mean, you really are somebody that actually knows what's going on, not pop garbage.
[02:36:22.433 --> 02:36:24.894]  So, just a brief synopsis of these people.
[02:36:25.851 --> 02:36:27.611]  Well, number one, they're not crazy.
[02:36:27.611 --> 02:36:30.832]  But let's get it very clear, and your audience has to understand it.
[02:36:30.832 --> 02:36:32.132]  They're not schizophrenic.
[02:36:32.132 --> 02:36:33.932]  There's nothing psychotic about them.
[02:36:33.932 --> 02:36:38.073]  These are very willful, determined sociopaths.
[02:36:38.073 --> 02:36:44.974]  Sociopaths meaning that, by definition, they grew up not caring about guilt, responsibility, or accountability.
[02:36:44.974 --> 02:36:48.635]  So once you have that dynamic in there, you have entitlement.
[02:36:48.635 --> 02:36:52.396]  Once you have entitlement, that means that you should be voting for me.
[02:36:52.396 --> 02:36:53.576]  Then you go to pandering.
[02:36:54.556 --> 02:36:59.917]  Most, like Obama and Hillary and Bill Clinton, all have the same dynamics.
[02:36:59.917 --> 02:37:09.520]  Sociopathy, lies of their histories, lies about their own self-identity, and basically they pander for favors.
[02:37:09.520 --> 02:37:15.581]  In turn, a system like the CIA or intelligence system can recruit them very quickly.
[02:37:15.581 --> 02:37:22.203]  When they're young, it was done with Obama because he was black, his mother was an operative, his grandfather was, his grandmother.
[02:37:22.723 --> 02:37:45.589]  And the same thing with Bill Clinton and Mena and throughout his own history when he had to go to Oxford and stroke Talbot was his roommate who was classical CIA from Yale who cleaned up all the junk that Bill Clinton did and the same thing with Hillary who has her own sexual problems, has a history of lesbianism, has a history of entitlement, corruption and ineptness.
[02:37:45.589 --> 02:37:47.249]  Once you have that dynamic
[02:37:47.990 --> 02:37:57.485]  The ability of the power of the state through covert action is very easy to manipulate these people and bring in the necessary money.
[02:37:59.898 --> 02:38:05.461]  Say what we want you to do, do what we want you to do, and if you don't, we'll get rid of you.
[02:38:05.461 --> 02:38:12.885]  But the only way they're terminated is the same way Putin understood about the Romanovs, about Tsar Nicholas, and about Stalin.
[02:38:12.885 --> 02:38:14.786]  They die or they leave office.
[02:38:14.786 --> 02:38:18.729]  They cannot be, uh, they will not resign on their own.
[02:38:18.729 --> 02:38:26.813]  Obama is not crazy, he's not sick, he's inept, he's arrogant, he's entitled, he's a sociopath, but there's nothing crazy about him.
[02:38:26.813 --> 02:38:27.834]  He's not very bright.
[02:38:28.414 --> 02:38:43.120]  The fact that he went to Occidental College, where all of my ex-CIA operatives teach, and the fact he did not go to Columbia, went to Harvard on affirmative action means that he was there because he's black, and he can articulate all kinds of nonsense.
[02:38:43.120 --> 02:38:44.600]  Same thing with Bill Clinton.
[02:38:44.600 --> 02:38:51.183]  Never showed up at Oxford, was in Moscow, worked for the agency, reported to guys who were in the agency.
[02:38:51.383 --> 02:38:58.045]  Sure, so let me ask you this in closing, and I want to have you back up on this whole history sometime, because it's intriguing, and I know what you're giving us is unfiltered, you know, from your own research.
[02:38:58.045 --> 02:39:01.066]  What you see is the truth, which, from my research, is incredibly accurate.
[02:39:01.066 --> 02:39:05.347]  This is somebody, you know, on the outside studying this and watching it closely.
[02:39:05.347 --> 02:39:06.948]  Who runs the CIA then?
[02:39:06.948 --> 02:39:09.909]  I mean, I know it was the Wall Street, the big mega banks that set it up.
[02:39:10.740 --> 02:39:11.301]  It was.
[02:39:11.301 --> 02:39:16.105]  It was the Dulles brothers to begin with who worked with the Germans during World War II.
[02:39:16.105 --> 02:39:18.307]  Then it was James Jesus Angleton.
[02:39:18.307 --> 02:39:19.489]  It was the Wasps.
[02:39:19.489 --> 02:39:24.113]  Eventually it came to the Catholics in what we call Catholics in Action.
[02:39:24.113 --> 02:39:27.897]  In this particular case, over about 20 years, it's been John Brennan.
[02:39:28.517 --> 02:39:37.368]  Who's been a special assistant to Obama and Bush Jr., who came out of Saudi Arabia, has a very checkered history of effectiveness.
[02:39:37.368 --> 02:39:40.772]  Even in the intelligence community, he's known as not being very effective.
[02:39:46.258 --> 02:39:47.419]  The Pope Francis?
[02:39:47.419 --> 02:39:48.819]  Or is this a separate Catholic?
[02:39:48.819 --> 02:39:54.461]  Well, the Pope Francis, as I told you and I told the audience, I knew him when he was the Director of the Jesuits.
[02:39:54.461 --> 02:40:00.424]  He's a ruthless, cunning, pandering individual who doesn't deserve to be the Pope.
[02:40:00.424 --> 02:40:04.425]  And I have great respect for Catholics, but I have no respect for the Pope.
[02:40:04.425 --> 02:40:09.187]  He allowed two of his Jesuits to be arrested and several of the nuns to be killed.
[02:40:09.187 --> 02:40:10.348]  And I was asked to come in
[02:40:10.968 --> 02:40:34.478]  by the Argentinian colonels to help out and I said no I will not incarcerate 6,000 Catholics in Argentina so the Pope is also one of those sociopaths who instead of coming through as grandiose does the reverse which is exactly grandiose he says oh no I'm not worthy and then uses all of the nonsense about hope and faith reaction formation
[02:40:35.839 --> 02:40:44.526]  I know when you talk about some of these histories, you literally have the FBI show up because, I mean, people can go with your name.
[02:40:44.526 --> 02:40:49.090]  Sure, I just want the audience to know, you're not making any of this stuff up, you really
[02:40:54.474 --> 02:40:54.694]  Yes, I will.
[02:41:18.874 --> 02:41:20.235]  That guy is so interesting, folks.
[02:41:20.235 --> 02:41:23.116]  I mean, it's just amazing.
[02:41:23.116 --> 02:41:33.200]  That guy's been, like, the whole nine yards, from the ground-level assassin right up to heavy operations and right at the start of Delta Force advising their psychological warfare operations.
[02:41:33.200 --> 02:41:34.701]  It's just incredible.
[02:41:34.701 --> 02:41:36.561]  And they just hate it when he comes on.
[02:41:36.561 --> 02:41:38.742]  They just cannot stand it.
[02:41:38.742 --> 02:41:42.664]  I have been threatened by the Israeli Mossad.
[02:41:42.664 --> 02:41:47.046]  I have been threatened by the CIA personally, to my face, okay?
[02:41:48.248 --> 02:41:49.608]  About having him on.
[02:41:49.608 --> 02:41:54.530]  I have been, you name it, I have just been, they cannot stand it.
[02:41:54.530 --> 02:41:58.131]  And look, all we're doing is you're exposing the stuff that's going on.
[02:41:58.131 --> 02:42:04.293]  Look, Jakari Jackson two years ago with Anand Salazar and Kit Daniels went down the border.
[02:42:04.293 --> 02:42:06.114]  We got contacted by the Border Patrol.
[02:42:06.114 --> 02:42:08.335]  They're the good guys.
[02:42:08.335 --> 02:42:10.415]  And said, yeah, we're completing the smuggling process.
[02:42:10.415 --> 02:42:14.277]  We blurred out the ICE agent's face, or just sat in the truck and talked to him.
[02:42:14.277 --> 02:42:15.077]  She couldn't even see the body.
[02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:37.187]  Scrambled his voice and he sent us over there, June 26th, we posted a flashback of this, but this was June of 2014, where it shows dozens of buses a day, hundreds and hundreds of people, whole families, none of them vetted, not checked for diseases, from all over the world, just let in.
[02:42:37.187 --> 02:42:41.128]  Caught red-handed, Border Patrol paying to ship illegals deep into the U.S.
[02:42:41.128 --> 02:42:45.650]  and I'm not going to play the whole seven-minute report, play about a minute of it, go to Jakari, but they're down there to just point out
[02:42:46.994 --> 02:42:47.934]  And talk to the locals.
[02:42:47.934 --> 02:42:50.495]  What do you think of they're not tested for disease?
[02:42:50.495 --> 02:42:51.216]  That's number one.
[02:42:51.216 --> 02:42:55.638]  22% increase in TB in quote migrants.
[02:42:55.638 --> 02:42:56.558]  They're coming in.
[02:42:56.558 --> 02:43:02.460]  They check you when you come through the border at customs as a citizen, but they're not checking these people.
[02:43:02.460 --> 02:43:03.361]  It's against the law.
[02:43:03.361 --> 02:43:05.642]  The Supreme Court ruled you can't do it.
[02:43:05.642 --> 02:43:08.963]  Last week, Obama says he's going to continue.
[02:43:08.963 --> 02:43:11.924]  I mean, I sat there going through customs Saturday and I didn't start arguing.
[02:43:11.924 --> 02:43:14.965]  I just said, you know, you just let everybody in if they're illegal.
[02:43:14.965 --> 02:43:15.926]  And the guy just said, yeah.
[02:43:17.592 --> 02:43:19.253]  I mean, we've talked to the Border Patrol at the checkpoint.
[02:43:19.253 --> 02:43:21.353]  Why do you want to search us 70 miles into the U.S.?
[02:43:21.353 --> 02:43:22.794]  Come back from Big Bend, the border's open.
[02:43:22.794 --> 02:43:24.174]  He goes, yeah, you're actually right.
[02:43:24.174 --> 02:43:26.655]  Go on in.
[02:43:26.655 --> 02:43:28.456]  But there's terrorists coming into the country.
[02:43:28.456 --> 02:43:29.176]  See, that's what I mean.
[02:43:29.176 --> 02:43:30.316]  This doesn't make sense.
[02:43:30.316 --> 02:43:33.958]  So here's a minute of Jokari's report where he's talking to the emergency manager of McAllen.
[02:43:33.958 --> 02:43:37.919]  Why this is important is on Friday, U.N.
[02:43:37.919 --> 02:43:40.040]  says more Central Americans headed to the U.S.
[02:43:40.040 --> 02:43:46.162]  And the first thing they say on the newscast is, illegals are coming in, they're illegal, but they're sent here by the Border Patrol, and they're just bussed out.
[02:43:47.301 --> 02:43:49.161]  And they make it like it's a wonderful thing.
[02:43:49.161 --> 02:43:50.902]  I mean, this is crazy.
[02:43:50.902 --> 02:43:58.084]  If I sneak an illegal in, we're talking five years in federal prison if I get a light sentence, folks.
[02:43:58.084 --> 02:44:03.385]  So we're talking to Jakari Jackson in just a moment, but he's really just there to get all these reports and go with those angles.
[02:44:03.385 --> 02:44:06.305]  Hey, what about the diseases coming in?
[02:44:06.305 --> 02:44:08.346]  What about citizens having to get checked?
[02:44:08.346 --> 02:44:09.786]  What about this not being covered in the media?
[02:44:09.786 --> 02:44:10.707]  Why is it finally being covered?
[02:44:10.707 --> 02:44:12.027]  I want to talk to the TV station.
[02:44:12.027 --> 02:44:13.447]  I want to talk to the emergency manager again.
[02:44:13.447 --> 02:44:15.708]  And this is just two years later, it's still every day, hundreds.
[02:44:15.708 --> 02:44:16.628]  They're there at the bus terminal.
[02:44:17.759 --> 02:44:20.430]  So let's play a clip of Jakari two years ago.
[02:44:20.430 --> 02:44:21.514]  Here it is.
[02:44:21.514 --> 02:44:23.562]  The people who you're housing here, where are they coming from?
[02:44:24.682 --> 02:44:26.643]  I'm being told they're coming from Central America.
[02:44:26.643 --> 02:44:28.103]  A lot of them are Central America.
[02:44:28.103 --> 02:44:34.346]  A lot of them are younger kids with their moms for the most part.
[02:44:34.346 --> 02:44:35.366]  And why Central America?
[02:44:35.366 --> 02:44:36.946]  Why is that the popular destination?
[02:44:36.946 --> 02:44:37.947]  I have no idea.
[02:44:37.947 --> 02:44:47.590]  What happened today in particular is that the Border Patrol dropped off some, they call them detainees, but obviously they're not detained after they drop them off.
[02:44:47.590 --> 02:44:51.972]  And normally they have tickets or arranged transportation to go somewhere in the interior.
[02:44:52.572 --> 02:45:00.564]  Well, today, apparently for some logistical reasons, some of them hadn't had transportation arranged or their transportation is tomorrow.
[02:45:00.564 --> 02:45:01.205]  Right.
[02:45:01.205 --> 02:45:03.188]  Kevin, stop right there.
[02:45:03.188 --> 02:45:06.292]  Now, 70% are underage, 18 or younger.
[02:45:06.292 --> 02:45:07.334]  That's the Fed's own numbers.
[02:45:07.334 --> 02:45:08.215]  We're on a Jakarta right now.
[02:45:09.912 --> 02:45:16.477]  The new video we have from this ABC, they're almost all, look like men and women, hardly any kids this time.
[02:45:16.477 --> 02:45:17.919]  Or teenagers.
[02:45:17.919 --> 02:45:22.783]  So again folks, this is a set deal, outside the law, and they're keeping the numbers secret.
[02:45:22.783 --> 02:45:27.406]  Jakari, I know you just got down there in the last 30 minutes or so, and you're about to file your reports for the Nightly News.
[02:45:27.406 --> 02:45:30.609]  Great job breaking this two years ago to you and Adon.
[02:45:30.609 --> 02:45:32.951]  But the mainstream media knows, they've been covering up.
[02:45:32.951 --> 02:45:33.892]  What have you learned so far?
[02:45:35.168 --> 02:45:39.389]  Chikara Jackson reporting from McAllen, Texas as you hear the report right there.
[02:45:39.389 --> 02:45:55.195]  It finally seems that the mainstream media is getting around to cover a story that we talked about two years ago about how many people who enter the country illegally are being provided with travel vouchers courtesy of the United States government and they go wherever they go and most of them don't return for their
[02:45:55.615 --> 02:45:56.355]  For their court dates.
[02:45:56.355 --> 02:45:59.136]  And that's the situation that's going on here.
[02:45:59.136 --> 02:46:03.257]  Currently, while we're at the McAllen bus station, there isn't too much traffic right here.
[02:46:03.257 --> 02:46:09.798]  We do know that the people are being provided with travel vouchers, but just the simple fact that they are given a voucher makes it very difficult to identify.
[02:46:09.798 --> 02:46:16.399]  So you don't know exactly who came in with a travel voucher, who didn't, and where they're going from here.
[02:46:16.399 --> 02:46:23.081]  Jakari, just as a citizen, what is it like for you, when I know you recently went on a trip to do some investigations in Asia,
[02:46:24.488 --> 02:46:40.071]  What is it like to, because you're a citizen, to be discriminated against, to be asked all these questions and go through naked body scanners, but then even at the airports they admit with a lot of the illegals that they're just groveling to them from China, you name it, just they don't even search them, they just let them in without even having IDs.
[02:46:40.071 --> 02:46:40.812]  I mean, that's crazy.
[02:46:41.653 --> 02:46:47.577]  Well it is rather absurd because when I returned to the states, I believe I was at JFK, and you know, I'm a U.S.
[02:46:47.577 --> 02:46:52.080]  citizen, I have my passport, you know, ID and all that, and the guy's giving me the third degree, like I deserve it.
[02:46:52.080 --> 02:46:53.401]  Like, where'd you come from?
[02:46:53.401 --> 02:46:54.322]  Did you bring anything back?
[02:46:54.322 --> 02:46:55.883]  And he's like, did you go business or pleasure?
[02:46:55.883 --> 02:46:57.344]  And he just was like grilling me.
[02:46:57.344 --> 02:46:59.005]  I was like, bro, I'm from Tulsa, Oklahoma.
[02:46:59.005 --> 02:47:01.146]  Like, what do you think I was out there doing?
[02:47:01.146 --> 02:47:02.908]  I have a Christian cross on my arm.
[02:47:02.908 --> 02:47:03.768]  What do you think I'm up to?
[02:47:05.369 --> 02:47:15.517]  That's the situation I have, but as you demonstrated in your example, there are many other people who come from other countries who don't have to go through the same harassment I do as an American citizen.
[02:47:15.517 --> 02:47:17.458]  Well, I mean, I threw out the three things I want you to cover.
[02:47:17.458 --> 02:47:20.820]  The disease, the above the law, the open borders, the U.N.
[02:47:20.820 --> 02:47:23.923]  calling the shots, because we played a clip last week where the U.N.
[02:47:23.923 --> 02:47:26.244]  admits they're running the migration to Europe and here.
[02:47:26.244 --> 02:47:27.605]  That's who Obama takes his orders from.
[02:47:27.605 --> 02:47:31.048]  I mean, what about the angle of Obama just ignoring the Supreme Court again?
[02:47:32.333 --> 02:47:34.834]  Obama doesn't get his authority from the Supreme Court.
[02:47:34.834 --> 02:47:36.635]  According to him, he gets it from the U.N.
[02:47:36.635 --> 02:47:42.839]  So he doesn't have to abide by any of the laws of the land, regardless of what the people of the United States collectively speak.
[02:47:42.839 --> 02:47:46.421]  He just ignores that, and he goes on about his own personal agenda.
[02:47:47.557 --> 02:48:00.541]  Well, all I know is, why do I have to pay taxes and have my genitals groped and everything, but all these foreigners, they admit flights every day to JFK, no one's even checked, IDs aren't even looked at, that's New York Daily News.
[02:48:00.541 --> 02:48:01.622]  This is bull!
[02:48:01.622 --> 02:48:09.725]  I mean, I'm sitting there with the customs guy, narrowing his eyes, he knows full well who I am, he's interrogating me every time they pull me out of the line for extra interrogation.
[02:48:09.725 --> 02:48:15.227]  Sometimes they take me behind closed doors, dig through my dirty underwear, literally, and just bug their eyes out at me!
[02:48:15.227 --> 02:48:16.387]  I mean, it's crazy!
[02:48:17.614 --> 02:48:18.454]  It's a power trip.
[02:48:18.454 --> 02:48:21.035]  You know, I've experienced those same things going through customs.
[02:48:21.035 --> 02:48:22.335]  Also when you go to the TSA.
[02:48:22.335 --> 02:48:23.736]  I mean, I've had multiple times.
[02:48:23.736 --> 02:48:29.477]  I went to TSA and some guy, he opened my Altoids can and was shaking the can around trying to see if there's stuff in there.
[02:48:29.477 --> 02:48:30.958]  It's just, it's completely ridiculous.
[02:48:30.958 --> 02:48:37.700]  It's a complete double standard, but I guess in the sake of political correctness, they feel they can do that to the American citizen, but not the non-citizen.
[02:48:38.320 --> 02:48:39.282]  Absolutely.
[02:48:39.282 --> 02:48:42.548]  You heard the angles I want to get covered, and obviously there's the big angle.
[02:48:42.548 --> 02:48:47.457]  The media finally covers that Obama and the Border Patrol are shipping the illegals in.
[02:48:47.457 --> 02:48:49.059]  What other angles are you going to hit, Jakari?
[02:48:50.083 --> 02:48:55.829]  Well, we're going to go out here and do a man on the street, and since we're so close to the border, one of the things we want to ask people is, how do you feel about the wall?
[02:48:55.829 --> 02:49:03.157]  Because we've seen the reports, I believe it was on MSNBC, where they went out and asked a similar question, and they were surprised that many people said they wanted it.
[02:49:03.157 --> 02:49:11.586]  So we're going to just ask the people who actually live here, not some talking head up in New York, what they think of the wall, if they think it's a good thing, if it's a bad thing, what they think about the situation in general.
[02:49:12.481 --> 02:49:20.686]  Sure, and when MSNBC did that, the guy spent two months actually at the border towns, the farmers, the ranchers, who were mainly Hispanic, where they're getting hit by the crime.
[02:49:20.686 --> 02:49:25.649]  I think a lot of folks who are going to file in the city are probably there illegal, so they might be supporting it, but that's my point.
[02:49:25.649 --> 02:49:27.591]  We don't even need a wall.
[02:49:27.591 --> 02:49:35.256]  We just need to go after employers that hire people illegally, flagrantly, and we need to just not ship people in and advertise all this free welfare.
[02:49:35.256 --> 02:49:35.676]  Game over.
[02:49:37.659 --> 02:49:39.700]  Yeah, that's a good point.
[02:49:39.700 --> 02:49:46.563]  I don't think the wall is the best of ideas, but if we enforce the laws that are already on the books, I think we could cut down on the problem a great deal.
[02:49:46.563 --> 02:49:50.425]  Well, I agree with Ron Paul when he said, like, five years ago, they were talking about a wall and you'll never finish it.
[02:49:50.425 --> 02:49:52.325]  He said, look, the wall's going to keep us in.
[02:49:52.325 --> 02:49:52.946]  That's true.
[02:49:53.866 --> 02:49:55.968]  They harass us, the citizens.
[02:49:55.968 --> 02:50:01.292]  I'm not even blaming the Border Patrol people, that's what they're ordered to do, the Customs people, but still it's happening.
[02:50:01.292 --> 02:50:06.696]  So no, look, the IRS wants a law where you can't even fly, period, if they claim they're investigating you.
[02:50:06.696 --> 02:50:09.338]  Now you can't leave the country if they've got an investigation open.
[02:50:09.338 --> 02:50:21.267]  So see, they're trying to make it hard for us to get out of the country, so I just say, you know what, I disagree with Trump on the wall, it's a fun thing to talk about and all this, but all I want Trump to do is just not let the illegals get free welfare.
[02:50:21.267 --> 02:50:21.928]  That'll fix it right there.
[02:50:23.271 --> 02:50:30.968]  And as you talk about this travel, I think if they want to take people's passports and deny them travel because they're under investigation, Mr. Clinton's under investigation.
[02:50:30.968 --> 02:50:33.594]  Why doesn't somebody say something about that and seize their assets?
[02:50:34.150 --> 02:50:35.451]  Oh, that's a good idea.
[02:50:35.451 --> 02:50:35.932]  Absolutely.
[02:50:35.932 --> 02:50:42.517]  We're not even talking about a criminal investigation with a grand jury or something, folks, or, you know, where you've been indicted and they say don't leave the county.
[02:50:42.517 --> 02:50:45.079]  We're talking about anybody when they just open an investigation.
[02:50:45.079 --> 02:50:47.942]  That's probably happened to me six, seven times in my life.
[02:50:47.942 --> 02:50:51.345]  Everybody else you know has had the IRS send them letters and open an investigation.
[02:50:51.345 --> 02:50:51.905]  Boom!
[02:50:51.905 --> 02:50:52.726]  Can't leave the U.S.
[02:50:52.726 --> 02:50:54.607]  when they got the investigation open.
[02:50:54.607 --> 02:50:56.109]  And, I mean, that is incredible.
[02:50:56.109 --> 02:50:58.511]  We'll come back with Jakari, Anna Don Salazar, then David Knight.
[02:51:00.029 --> 02:51:02.652]  Hey non-attorney spokesperson, Bar Justice is responsible for the content of this ad.
[02:51:02.652 --> 02:51:05.575]  This ad is not legal advice and the choice of a lawyer should not be based solely upon advertisements.
[02:51:05.575 --> 02:51:07.016]  Service may not be available in all states.
[02:51:07.016 --> 02:51:07.657]  Attention!
[02:51:07.657 --> 02:51:13.663]  This is an important message for anyone who had an IVC filter implanted to prevent blood clots from traveling to their heart or lungs.
[02:51:13.663 --> 02:51:16.746]  The FDA warns that IVC filters may cause serious complications.
[02:51:16.766 --> 02:51:17.126]  I think so.
[02:51:36.320 --> 02:51:39.603]  Our network of experienced attorneys is ready to fight for you at no charge.
[02:51:39.603 --> 02:51:41.704]  You pay no fees unless your case is settled.
[02:51:41.704 --> 02:51:46.108]  But hurry, time is limited to make a claim, so call now for a free confidential consultation.
[02:51:46.108 --> 02:51:47.229]  Don't fight this alone.
[02:51:47.229 --> 02:51:51.452]  If you or a loved one has had an IVC filter implanted, call IVC Filter Justice now at 800-870-7899.
[02:51:51.452 --> 02:51:51.532]  800-870-7899.
[02:51:51.532 --> 02:51:51.733]  That's 800-870-7899.
[02:51:59.799 --> 02:52:07.961]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but were waiting for an outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[02:52:07.961 --> 02:52:08.761]  Here's why.
[02:52:08.761 --> 02:52:12.902]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[02:52:12.902 --> 02:52:13.822]  So please listen.
[02:52:13.822 --> 02:52:17.503]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power.
[02:52:17.503 --> 02:52:23.864]  And unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the sun.
[02:52:23.864 --> 02:52:26.165]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts,
[02:52:26.445 --> 02:52:28.206]  Intensifying civil unrest.
[02:52:28.206 --> 02:52:31.147]  You're not going to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[02:52:31.147 --> 02:52:33.468]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[02:52:33.468 --> 02:52:38.310]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators.
[02:52:38.310 --> 02:52:45.012]  And they're giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low price for InfoWars listeners.
[02:52:45.012 --> 02:52:46.753]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[02:52:46.753 --> 02:52:48.434]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:52:48.434 --> 02:52:50.175]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:52:50.175 --> 02:52:53.836]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[02:52:53.996 --> 02:52:55.566]  Go to gridwars.com.
[02:52:55.566 --> 02:52:56.633]  That's gridwars.com.
[02:52:59.344 --> 02:53:04.806]  DarkCityDefense.com was born in Black Mountain, at the foot of the Black Mountain Range in North Carolina.
[02:53:04.806 --> 02:53:13.790]  From the Dark City as it's affectionately been named, we've built an online firearms pro store that boasts a vast range of firearms, optics, and outdoor supplies.
[02:53:13.790 --> 02:53:24.534]  With aggressively low everyday pricing and a free gift pack with every firearms purchase, DarkCityDefense.com is committed to tier one customer service and overcoming darkness by turning on the light of liberty.
[02:53:24.534 --> 02:53:28.256]  Find the light in our logo and find out more at DarkCityDefense.com.
[02:53:29.156 --> 02:53:31.817]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic.
[02:53:31.817 --> 02:53:36.058]  And only one system allows you to generate an endless supply of natural silver solutions.
[02:53:36.058 --> 02:53:37.418]  Silverlungs.com.
[02:53:37.418 --> 02:53:40.059]  You'll find no wild claims or pseudoscience.
[02:53:40.059 --> 02:53:42.999]  Just a lifetime of nano-sized pure silver solutions.
[02:53:42.999 --> 02:53:45.300]  The Silverlungs generator allows you to make your own.
[02:53:45.300 --> 02:53:47.160]  So stop paying for silver solutions.
[02:53:47.160 --> 02:53:52.642]  The unique lung delivery system targets respiratory infections where other silver solutions simply cannot reach.
[02:53:52.642 --> 02:53:56.383]  See the Silverlungs generator and lung delivery system at Silverlungs.com.
[02:53:56.383 --> 02:53:57.863]  That's Silverlungs.com.
[02:54:04.457 --> 02:54:07.618]  I'm going to do five minutes in the next hour, cover some of the news I haven't hit yet.
[02:54:07.618 --> 02:54:08.799]  And then David Knight's taking over.
[02:54:08.799 --> 02:54:11.660]  He's going to be getting into Trump versus GOP.
[02:54:11.660 --> 02:54:13.261]  The abortion ruling of the Supreme Court.
[02:54:13.261 --> 02:54:22.785]  Obama's going to follow that one, but not the one about, hey, you can't bring in people and advertise everything's free and then have the Border Patrol be a delivery force for the illegals.
[02:54:22.785 --> 02:54:23.766]  I mean, it's just not fair.
[02:54:23.766 --> 02:54:25.066]  No other country acts like this.
[02:54:25.066 --> 02:54:26.707]  It's so crazy.
[02:54:26.707 --> 02:54:28.308]  Fine, let the illegals in.
[02:54:28.308 --> 02:54:29.348]  Give me free stuff, too.
[02:54:29.348 --> 02:54:30.509]  Just don't grab my genitals.
[02:54:31.701 --> 02:54:33.342]  That's what makes me so mad about this.
[02:54:33.342 --> 02:54:39.344]  It's just, it's so obvious they're bringing in voters and unskilled laborers to break the economy.
[02:54:39.344 --> 02:54:41.745]  That's a model the globalists have.
[02:54:41.745 --> 02:54:47.528]  Briefing before I go back and get some final comments from Jakari Jackson.
[02:54:47.528 --> 02:54:50.809]  We're sold out of the Hillary Clinton for prison shirts.
[02:54:50.809 --> 02:54:52.090]  That was edition number two.
[02:54:52.090 --> 02:54:53.430]  Edition three is coming out.
[02:54:53.430 --> 02:54:57.552]  It's the same except it has Infowars.com on the shoulder, not just on the back.
[02:54:58.288 --> 02:55:01.011]  And then Hillary for President in 2016.
[02:55:01.011 --> 02:55:02.192]  But that has sold out.
[02:55:02.192 --> 02:55:04.434]  I think there's like a few left in small.
[02:55:04.434 --> 02:55:06.817]  Because you get 75% off on it when you sign up for the newsletter.
[02:55:06.817 --> 02:55:08.539]  50% off when you just buy one.
[02:55:09.710 --> 02:55:16.553]  That special is ending in the next few hours, and it really is causing a national meme all over TV.
[02:55:16.553 --> 02:55:17.433]  People are wearing it.
[02:55:17.433 --> 02:55:20.835]  The top Google search last week was, is Hillary Clinton going to prison?
[02:55:20.835 --> 02:55:23.276]  This is just an example of the power of the people.
[02:55:23.276 --> 02:55:29.799]  And wearing a Moulin Lambe or an InfoWars shirt from InfoWarsStore.com, not just Hillary for prison, you will meet like-minded people.
[02:55:29.799 --> 02:55:32.120]  You will find out how many patriots there are.
[02:55:32.120 --> 02:55:33.981]  You will run into these around your town or city.
[02:55:33.981 --> 02:55:38.183]  You'll meet enough folks in a few months walking around the streets to form a huge organization politically.
[02:55:38.784 --> 02:55:44.464]  Also, a deep cleanse is an amazing system of key herbs and other compounds that detoxify the body.
[02:55:45.649 --> 02:55:49.492]  It's 20% off until Wednesday, and your purchase helps fund this operation.
[02:55:49.492 --> 02:55:50.633]  It really is an amazing product.
[02:55:50.633 --> 02:55:52.515]  Just take a drop or full out of the tongue every day.
[02:55:52.515 --> 02:56:04.004]  It works in synergy with the X2, the other great products like DNA Force at InfoWarsLife.com, or InfoWarsStore.com is the umbrella site, or call us at 3888-253-3139.
[02:56:04.004 --> 02:56:07.507]  An internal FEMA report being reported on by Vice.
[02:56:07.507 --> 02:56:09.008]  It's on drudge.
[02:56:09.008 --> 02:56:12.090]  It says 300 plus percent food increases in the next few years.
[02:56:12.090 --> 02:56:13.511]  That's what the government thinks is going to happen.
[02:56:14.492 --> 02:56:18.616]  All I know is you need to get Swirlable Foods, and the best place to get them is InfoWareStore.com.
[02:56:18.616 --> 02:56:19.717]  InfoWare Select, 15% off.
[02:56:19.717 --> 02:56:22.339]  We're running that for one week only.
[02:56:22.339 --> 02:56:25.161]  It's not 30% off, but it's already a super low price, folks.
[02:56:25.161 --> 02:56:28.344]  We can't always offer 30% off, but 15% is the best I can do.
[02:56:28.344 --> 02:56:30.145]  We already have the lowest price out there.
[02:56:30.145 --> 02:56:32.968]  Okay, Jakari, other points that I haven't raised.
[02:56:32.968 --> 02:56:35.670]  What else is on your radar, my friend, in this bizarro world?
[02:56:37.298 --> 02:56:40.999]  Well, it's a very strange time, Alex, just as you were talking about many of the things there.
[02:56:40.999 --> 02:56:45.700]  The Hillary for Prison t-shirts, as you said, it's a great way to meet like-minded people.
[02:56:45.700 --> 02:56:48.601]  Every time we go out to the rallies, we see a lot of these just around town.
[02:56:48.601 --> 02:56:51.022]  I see people wearing the Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[02:56:51.022 --> 02:56:54.963]  I haven't seen too many around here, but you can understand why that is.
[02:56:54.963 --> 02:57:01.685]  But as we continue to do the reports out here, we're going to have some reports coming in where we have people flying the drone.
[02:57:02.305 --> 02:57:13.567]  Around the border trying to get various footage out there, and we have many more things that we hope to get lined up a couple interviews We're looking into so hopefully we'll have all those reports in the next day or so well incredible job I mean every time you guys go down there.
[02:57:13.567 --> 02:57:20.548]  You just absolutely national news I mean you guys caught with bags all the drugs being brought in And you know all the rest of it.
[02:57:20.548 --> 02:57:25.909]  It's just crazy that our media could be doing this, but they won't do it It's not that I mean we are good.
[02:57:25.909 --> 02:57:27.949]  We work hard our crew is wonderful.
[02:57:27.949 --> 02:57:30.330]  It's not that I'm even that good It's that they won't do their job
[02:57:31.070 --> 02:57:34.432]  I mean, how many news items a week do we break nationally?
[02:57:34.432 --> 02:57:35.793]  It's like every day, Jakari.
[02:57:35.793 --> 02:57:38.775]  Yeah, it's a lot.
[02:57:38.775 --> 02:57:39.896]  Watson's way up there.
[02:57:39.896 --> 02:57:42.778]  Many of the other guys do pretty well putting that stuff out of the news cycle.
[02:57:43.322 --> 02:57:44.523]  Well, you're doing a great job, too.
[02:57:44.523 --> 02:57:47.186]  And again, it's not about just, oh, you're great, I'm great.
[02:57:47.186 --> 02:57:51.431]  But I just want to talk about the great crew, the great guests we have, and the fact that we're having an effect.
[02:57:51.431 --> 02:58:00.521]  And I want the listeners to know, supporting the broadcast, spreading the word, signing up for the free newsletter, buying the products, all of it is really having a big effect, supporting our local stations, Jakari.
[02:58:00.521 --> 02:58:04.706]  I mean, it's amazing to see how we're really changing the narrative back towards reality.
[02:58:05.933 --> 02:58:07.194]  Yeah, it is a big effect.
[02:58:07.194 --> 02:58:14.278]  You know, it's like everything we do, whether people, they parrot it, or they do some kind of hit piece off of it, or whatever else, is definitely out there in the consciousness.
[02:58:14.278 --> 02:58:17.060]  And this is the mainstream media with a 6% trust rate.
[02:58:17.060 --> 02:58:19.601]  When they attack us, it's like a badge of courage.
[02:58:19.601 --> 02:58:21.962]  It's like having a child molester salon.
[02:58:21.962 --> 02:58:25.725]  You know, the child molester site that's constantly writing articles about child molesting is great.
[02:58:26.525 --> 02:58:26.745]  Thank you.
[02:58:49.938 --> 02:58:55.020]  Over the years, there have been a lot of powerful advancements in the field of science and nutraceuticals.

[02:59:40.657 --> 02:59:46.960]  So many people call into my radio show and tell me how Longevity and the products at Infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[02:59:46.960 --> 02:59:48.261]  Check it out for yourself today.
[02:59:52.405 --> 03:00:01.810]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:00:01.810 --> 03:00:14.075]  Waging war on corruption.
[03:00:14.075 --> 03:00:19.198]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live from the front lines of the Infowar.
[03:00:21.283 --> 03:00:26.946]  Look, I'm not complaining, but I am just exhausted.
[03:00:26.946 --> 03:00:42.713]  And by exhausted, to watch them roll out total open borders, lawlessness, the UN running it, and every other law being ignored by a group of criminals that are looting the entire nation,
[03:00:43.769 --> 03:00:49.672]  And they're openly pushing, arresting people that disagree with the government in the Democratic Party platform.
[03:00:49.672 --> 03:00:51.353]  I am entering the Twilight Zone.
[03:00:51.353 --> 03:00:54.595]  I mean, I knew this was all coming.
[03:00:54.595 --> 03:00:58.317]  But it is something else to actually see it unfold.
[03:00:58.317 --> 03:00:59.077]  Look at this article.
[03:00:59.077 --> 03:01:01.839]  I didn't even get to this today, but Paul Watson, InfoWars.com.
[03:01:02.878 --> 03:01:09.203]  And there's like articles on Drudge with Muslim women freaking out and attacking gay people.
[03:01:09.203 --> 03:01:18.049]  It's like, dude, in their own countries they will stone you to death if a woman is seen walking around without her head covered.
[03:01:18.049 --> 03:01:22.952]  I mean, I don't want to sign up to something beyond Jim Jones and Heaven's Gate all rolled into one.
[03:01:22.952 --> 03:01:24.373]  I don't like cults, man!
[03:01:24.373 --> 03:01:30.638]  I got a bunch of weird people calling themselves liberals saying I'm closed-minded and Islamophobic.
[03:01:32.392 --> 03:01:37.557]  A phobia is being scared of something that isn't scary.
[03:01:37.557 --> 03:01:43.642]  I'm somebody that'll swim in the ocean at night.
[03:01:43.642 --> 03:01:48.306]  Other people don't go to the Texas coast and swim out 200 yards on their moon.
[03:01:48.306 --> 03:01:50.108]  I do it, because I enjoy it.
[03:01:50.108 --> 03:01:56.534]  I mean, I was fearless when I was like 11, 12 years old, just go out swimming at night.
[03:01:58.180 --> 03:02:24.228]  I'm not saying I'm Mr. Courage here, but I love the people calling me a coward because, no, they're bringing in people that are so dysfunctional, their countries have fallen apart, and so-called liberals are bringing it in, worshipping Hillary, who she claims loves gay people, and she gets more money from folks that kill people like that than you can ever imagine.
[03:02:24.228 --> 03:02:25.929]  I'm just sick of what frauds you are.
[03:02:27.597 --> 03:02:28.978]  Cultural enrichment.
[03:02:28.978 --> 03:02:31.040]  Muslim smashes up Swedish church.
[03:02:31.040 --> 03:02:34.463]  Italian saint defaced with Allah Akbar.
[03:02:34.463 --> 03:02:35.905]  Graffiti.
[03:02:35.905 --> 03:02:39.388]  European multiculturalism continues to work wonders.
[03:02:39.388 --> 03:02:43.412]  And I mean, we see these stories every hour now.
[03:02:46.832 --> 03:03:01.335]  I was at the mall and saw women in full hijabs and burqas by themselves in groups and then saw their men around other corners and actually had them going... And I mean, I know there's other Muslim waves that aren't bad people, fleeing the radicals and all that.
[03:03:01.335 --> 03:03:08.336]  The point is, is they're bringing in folks from the worst places that run around killing their fellow Muslims.
[03:03:08.336 --> 03:03:12.657]  And the Pope is running around shooting his mouth off and I'm just personally sick of it.
[03:03:13.971 --> 03:03:15.632]  But look at this.
[03:03:15.632 --> 03:03:19.356]  Kit Daniels came in and pointed this out.
[03:03:19.356 --> 03:03:28.263]  In 2014, he wrote, Border Patrol agents, this is from them, UN taking control of America's southern border.
[03:03:28.263 --> 03:03:36.350]  Under the pretense of labeling illegals refugees, UN personnel working with DHS to ship MS-13 gang members in the US, says agent.
[03:03:37.276 --> 03:03:52.942]  And now, two years later, after we break all this and show them admitting it, and show the buses shipping them in, ABC News, UN, more Central Americans headed to US, and the newscast admits they're illegal, but they're legalized instantly by a magic fiat.
[03:03:52.942 --> 03:03:56.644]  There's not even border agents there, they just put them at the bus stop.
[03:03:56.644 --> 03:03:58.104]  With money.
[03:03:58.104 --> 03:04:02.426]  And now they're, these new waves are almost all men.
[03:04:02.426 --> 03:04:04.927]  Watch the video.
[03:04:04.927 --> 03:04:06.848]  I mean, it is just crazy.
[03:04:08.797 --> 03:04:13.480]  And man, I was sitting there with that customs agent Saturday.
[03:04:13.480 --> 03:04:16.462]  He looked me up and down, asked me all these questions.
[03:04:16.462 --> 03:04:19.483]  I kept answering him, he kept asking me questions again.
[03:04:19.483 --> 03:04:23.366]  Called my kids over, called my parents over, and asked them all questions.
[03:04:23.366 --> 03:04:27.668]  And just sat there looking at us, not hatefully, but just real serious.
[03:04:27.668 --> 03:04:29.869]  Gotta check you, because we know full well who you are.
[03:04:29.869 --> 03:04:32.231]  We gotta check you, because you have no criminal record.
[03:04:32.231 --> 03:04:34.592]  We gotta check you real close, buddy.
[03:04:34.592 --> 03:04:37.314]  Because you're a big fat milk cow that pays this government a lot of taxes.
[03:04:38.660 --> 03:04:40.161]  It's good to be a slave!
[03:04:40.161 --> 03:04:42.523]  The land of the free, home of the cowards.
[03:04:42.523 --> 03:04:43.644]  I tell you, it's sickening.
[03:04:43.644 --> 03:04:46.746]  InfoWars.com, though, is reaching people more than ever.
[03:04:46.746 --> 03:04:48.808]  We're under attack because we're having an effect.
[03:04:48.808 --> 03:04:50.069]  We're the best ammo for the fight.
[03:04:50.069 --> 03:04:53.491]  Get our videos, get our articles, get the links to listen to the show.
[03:04:53.491 --> 03:04:56.714]  Out to everybody you know, InfoWars.com forward slash show.
[03:04:56.714 --> 03:04:57.934]  David Knight, straight ahead.
[03:04:57.934 --> 03:04:58.375]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.063 --> 03:05:08.633]  Both GOP nominee Donald Trump and leftist investor George Soros have predicted the complete downfall of the European Union, despite Trump being a nationalist and Soros a globalist.
[03:05:08.633 --> 03:05:18.464]  The two billionaires both independently declared that they believe a domino effect has been started by Britain's decision to leave the EU, and the process will be difficult for anyone to stop, as reported by Steve Watson.
[03:05:18.464 --> 03:05:19.325]  Soros said, quote,
[03:05:19.505 --> 03:05:25.226]  Now the catastrophic scenario that many feared has materialized, making the disintegration of the EU practically irreversible.
[03:05:25.226 --> 03:05:33.768]  Trump also predicted a complete breakup of the EU and also warned that the continent would be completely unrecognizable within 10 years if strict immigration controls are not enacted.
[03:05:33.768 --> 03:05:36.289]  Trump told reporters, quote, The people have spoken.
[03:05:36.289 --> 03:05:37.889]  I think the EU is going to break up.
[03:05:37.889 --> 03:05:40.850]  I think the EU might break up before anyone thinks and turns to Scotland.
[03:05:41.010 --> 03:05:44.895]  Trump is referring to the resistance Scottish politicians are still giving Brexit.
[03:05:44.895 --> 03:05:50.661]  He continued, stating that, I really think that without the immigration issue, the EU wouldn't have had a chance of breaking up.
[03:05:50.661 --> 03:05:53.304]  The people are fed up, whether it's here or in other countries.
[03:05:53.304 --> 03:05:55.127]  You watch, other countries will follow.
[03:05:55.127 --> 03:05:57.169]  For more news, visit InfoWars.com.
[03:05:57.169 --> 03:05:58.631]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:05:59.622 --> 03:06:00.442]  Hey, everyone!
[03:06:00.442 --> 03:06:02.723]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of The Bright Side.
[03:06:02.723 --> 03:06:06.564]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[03:06:06.564 --> 03:06:08.645]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[03:06:08.645 --> 03:06:18.908]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[03:06:18.908 --> 03:06:24.890]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge, and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[03:06:25.290 --> 03:06:25.731]  We're good to go.
[03:06:40.247 --> 03:06:40.727]  I think so.
[03:06:59.466 --> 03:07:01.507]  Brainforce, it's completely different.
[03:07:01.507 --> 03:07:02.728]  Try a bottle of it.
[03:07:02.728 --> 03:07:04.329]  Rob Dew joins us.
[03:07:04.329 --> 03:07:07.431]  You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours.
[03:07:07.431 --> 03:07:08.511]  Tell us what Brainforce did.
[03:07:08.511 --> 03:07:09.472]  I've been working all day.
[03:07:09.472 --> 03:07:11.953]  I took a couple hours off coaching basketball.
[03:07:11.953 --> 03:07:13.374]  I get in here at 8 30.
[03:07:13.374 --> 03:07:15.295]  I was kind of run down.
[03:07:15.295 --> 03:07:17.236]  You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it.
[03:07:17.236 --> 03:07:19.097]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview.
[03:07:19.097 --> 03:07:20.938]  I got my bottle of Brainforce right there.
[03:07:20.938 --> 03:07:21.999]  I popped two of them.
[03:07:21.999 --> 03:07:23.600]  And about 20 minutes later, it's like,
[03:07:24.261 --> 03:07:25.963]  Everything just kind of clears up.
[03:07:25.963 --> 03:07:27.725]  It's got four and a half stars.
[03:07:27.725 --> 03:07:29.047]  People really love it.
[03:07:29.047 --> 03:07:29.647]  Read about it.
[03:07:29.647 --> 03:07:38.759]  Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[03:07:38.939 --> 03:07:42.980]  I haven't pulled an all-nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it without Brain Force.
[03:07:42.980 --> 03:07:49.123]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more Brain Force and came in.
[03:07:49.123 --> 03:07:55.045]  You will find Brain Force and other game-changing products at InfoWarsLife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[03:08:09.537 --> 03:08:10.958]  You want answers?
[03:08:10.958 --> 03:08:12.119]  Well, so does he.
[03:08:12.119 --> 03:08:14.620]  It's Alex Jones.
[03:08:14.620 --> 03:08:20.003]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:08:20.003 --> 03:08:24.966]  On this Monday, June 27, 2016, we have a major Supreme Court decision.
[03:08:24.966 --> 03:08:27.528]  I want to tell you a little bit about what's behind that.
[03:08:27.528 --> 03:08:33.492]  We also have another example of Obama's monumental theft and fraud.
[03:08:34.454 --> 03:08:36.375]  And this is happening all across the country.
[03:08:36.375 --> 03:08:50.305]  We've done a report, I did one with Rob Jacobson, about the millions upon millions of acres that Obama is stealing, and yet today he's come out with a new monument.
[03:08:50.305 --> 03:08:55.789]  He's made a monument of Stonewall Inn in New York City.
[03:08:55.789 --> 03:08:59.292]  This is an LGBT monument, and I have to look at this and wonder,
[03:09:00.222 --> 03:09:04.024]  Is Obama going to take all of New York City as part of this monument?
[03:09:04.024 --> 03:09:08.846]  Because you see, that would be the parallel to what he's doing across the country.
[03:09:08.846 --> 03:09:09.926]  So we'll talk about that a little bit.
[03:09:09.926 --> 03:09:19.050]  We're also going to talk about some Trump news as well as the whiny millennials and Brexit and what's really behind that.
[03:09:19.050 --> 03:09:21.711]  Let's talk about the Supreme Court decision first.
[03:09:21.711 --> 03:09:24.652]  Now this is the report on it from the Wall Street Journal.
[03:09:24.652 --> 03:09:28.874]  The headline says, Supreme Court rejects a Texas abortion law as an undue burden.
[03:09:29.744 --> 03:09:30.624]  An undue burden.
[03:09:30.624 --> 03:09:35.807]  Now understand, this was a 5-3 vote, so it would not have made any difference if Scalia had been around.
[03:09:35.807 --> 03:09:38.509]  It would have been a 5-4 vote.
[03:09:38.509 --> 03:09:44.932]  This was made possible because we had Anthony Kennedy, who many people thought, well, it's going to be a 4-4 split.
[03:09:44.932 --> 03:09:48.134]  It will go back to a lower court, which has already thrown out this charge.
[03:09:48.134 --> 03:09:49.935]  They've already lost at the lower level.
[03:09:49.935 --> 03:09:51.976]  So the law will stand.
[03:09:51.976 --> 03:09:53.957]  The Texas law will stand.
[03:09:55.100 --> 03:09:56.581]  But that didn't happen.
[03:09:56.581 --> 03:10:05.626]  Instead, we had a justice that was appointed by Ronald Reagan joining two justices from Clinton and two justices from Obama.
[03:10:05.626 --> 03:10:07.027]  See how that works?
[03:10:07.027 --> 03:10:15.933]  See, it's not a very good strategy, is it, to try to make sure the Constitution is going to be saved by appointing judges.
[03:10:15.933 --> 03:10:17.934]  Yes, a good idea to try to do that.
[03:10:17.934 --> 03:10:22.176]  We should try to appoint judges who will rule according to law.
[03:10:23.297 --> 03:10:28.699]  But understand that there's a lot of judges there already, and of course it's going to get worse if Hillary Clinton wins.
[03:10:28.699 --> 03:10:36.962]  She's going to appoint the types of judges that ruled here that said, we don't care what the law says, we don't care what the legal procedure is, we like abortion and that's it.
[03:10:36.962 --> 03:10:43.144]  And if you think that's a stupid characterization of this, an oversimplification of it, it's not.
[03:10:43.144 --> 03:10:45.865]  The first thing that this dissent from Alito
[03:10:47.881 --> 03:10:48.441]  Talks about.
[03:10:48.441 --> 03:10:49.982]  And let's go back to the law first.
[03:10:49.982 --> 03:10:51.263]  Okay, this is something going back to 2013.
[03:10:51.263 --> 03:10:52.983]  This is a Texas law.
[03:10:52.983 --> 03:10:55.044]  It was signed in by Rick Perry.
[03:10:55.044 --> 03:11:02.027]  And what it did was it required abortion clinics to have the same standards that ambulatory surgical centers would have.
[03:11:02.027 --> 03:11:04.969]  That they would have physicians there who were really physicians.
[03:11:04.969 --> 03:11:08.090]  They were admitted to hospital privileges within 30 miles.
[03:11:08.090 --> 03:11:14.573]  They also enacted a lot of other safety regulations that previously had not been enacted against abortion clinics.
[03:11:15.293 --> 03:11:23.219]  Things like smoke detectors and making sure that you can get a gurney through the aisles of the little house.
[03:11:23.219 --> 03:11:27.403]  And in many cases, these were not purpose-built clinics.
[03:11:27.403 --> 03:11:33.207]  Many of these were just simply homes that had been repurposed as an abortion clinic.
[03:11:33.207 --> 03:11:34.569]  Residential homes.
[03:11:34.569 --> 03:11:42.014]  And so there were impediments in terms of being able to get somebody out of there in case an emergency procedure had occurred.
[03:11:42.014 --> 03:11:43.316]  Wouldn't you think those would be reasonable?
[03:11:44.161 --> 03:11:51.404]  Wouldn't you think that if this really was about women's health, as we're being told, that they would want to have these kinds of safeguards in there?
[03:11:51.404 --> 03:12:01.108]  You see, it brilliantly called the bluff of these people who simply want to murder babies as part of a eugenics agenda.
[03:12:01.108 --> 03:12:02.709]  And we've exposed that over and over again.
[03:12:02.709 --> 03:12:04.190]  That's how this started with Margaret Sanger.
[03:12:04.190 --> 03:12:05.911]  That's how it started with Planned Parenthood.
[03:12:05.911 --> 03:12:10.793]  You can go back and you can see the writings of the Democrats and the Republicans.
[03:12:11.693 --> 03:12:20.015]  All the generations of the George Bush family, going back to Prescott Bush, and then going through George H.W.
[03:12:20.015 --> 03:12:22.856]  as well as just recently in the debates.
[03:12:22.856 --> 03:12:25.917]  Remember when Jeb was talking about how, well, we stopped the funding.
[03:12:25.917 --> 03:12:27.937]  We had about a half million or whatever the number was.
[03:12:27.937 --> 03:12:28.597]  I can't remember.
[03:12:28.597 --> 03:12:39.620]  It was essentially 30 times the amount of money he donated with his private organization to Planned Parenthood, but publicly what he did was he stopped a little bit of funding from the state of Florida.
[03:12:40.543 --> 03:12:41.684]  That's the way the Bushes have been.
[03:12:41.684 --> 03:12:48.430]  Of course, his grandfather was the first treasurer of Planned Parenthood, along with Margaret Sanger.
[03:12:48.430 --> 03:12:49.791]  We've shown you the letters.
[03:12:49.791 --> 03:12:53.214]  We've shown you the letters from George H.W.
[03:12:53.214 --> 03:12:54.896]  Bush, and so forth and so on.
[03:12:54.896 --> 03:13:04.845]  So, we've had a long history of the elites in both the Republican and Democrat Party who are interested, quite frankly, in eugenics.
[03:13:06.514 --> 03:13:08.218]  And they're not interested in women's health.
[03:13:08.218 --> 03:13:13.648]  And this is similar to the situation that we had when we had the EPA under Lisa Jackson.
[03:13:13.648 --> 03:13:14.890]  We've talked about this many times.
[03:13:14.890 --> 03:13:16.493]  This is the first story I covered when I got here.
[03:13:17.506 --> 03:13:24.752]  They were hooking people up to tailpipes of diesel motors, okay, putting them in a room at the University of North Carolina.
[03:13:24.752 --> 03:13:28.155]  And of course, University of North Carolina, I got a little bit of news on them as well here.
[03:13:28.155 --> 03:13:36.522]  A new story about them, Christmas vacations now, microaggression, along with terms like boyfriend and girlfriend, and I love your shoes, things like that, okay.
[03:13:37.432 --> 03:13:40.093]  UNC in Chapel Hill is a loony bin.
[03:13:40.093 --> 03:13:41.874]  I used to live close to there.
[03:13:41.874 --> 03:13:44.174]  And I can tell you that it is over the top.
[03:13:44.174 --> 03:13:47.255]  It's like a university in California or something.
[03:13:47.255 --> 03:13:56.458]  But anyway, at UNC, along with the EPA, they were hooking people up to diesel tailpipes.
[03:13:56.458 --> 03:14:03.801]  They had asked for volunteers who had respiratory issues, who had heart issues, because they wanted people to have problems.
[03:14:04.881 --> 03:14:05.241]  And they did.
[03:14:05.241 --> 03:14:07.424]  They found some people who did have some problems.
[03:14:07.424 --> 03:14:16.913]  And we had a spot-on researcher who was working, Steve Malloy, who was working on this and noticed it and expanded it.
[03:14:16.913 --> 03:14:18.074]  We tried to get that stopped.
[03:14:18.902 --> 03:14:20.023]  But here's the point.
[03:14:20.023 --> 03:14:25.048]  We'd had Lisa Jackson go before Congress and say, I'm not talking about people getting sick.
[03:14:25.048 --> 03:14:27.931]  I'm talking about people dying from this.
[03:14:27.931 --> 03:14:35.198]  And so we have to do more to squash diesel engines and to enact more regulations from the EPA.
[03:14:35.198 --> 03:14:36.219]  She actually said that.
[03:14:36.219 --> 03:14:38.221]  It was a dog and pony show that was
[03:14:39.292 --> 03:14:44.615]  orchestrated and scripted by Markey out of Massachusetts.
[03:14:44.615 --> 03:14:45.896]  He was a congressman at the time.
[03:14:45.896 --> 03:14:48.457]  Now he's moved up because he does stuff like that.
[03:14:48.457 --> 03:14:49.758]  He's now a senator.
[03:14:49.758 --> 03:14:55.421]  So they scripted this thing and said, no, we're talking about it killing people.
[03:14:55.421 --> 03:15:01.644]  And then they go out and they expose these people to 72 times the level that they said was already fatal.
[03:15:01.644 --> 03:15:02.245]  So we said, wait,
[03:15:03.041 --> 03:15:09.487]  Is this a war crime situation, or are you just lying to people when you said it was going to kill people?
[03:15:09.487 --> 03:15:15.452]  So, when you look at these laws with the Texas abortion law, they say, oh, we just are here for women's health.
[03:15:15.452 --> 03:15:16.452]  We say, oh really?
[03:15:16.452 --> 03:15:19.315]  Well, then let's make sure that these are safe procedures.
[03:15:19.315 --> 03:15:22.377]  So they call their bluff, and they put out this law there.
[03:15:22.377 --> 03:15:24.139]  And it was struck down.
[03:15:24.139 --> 03:15:28.322]  Again, Justice Kennedy, a Reagan justice, switched sides.
[03:15:28.322 --> 03:15:30.744]  And as Wall Street Journal points out, Justice Alito
[03:15:31.485 --> 03:15:36.986]  Who wrote the main dissent rocked back and forth in his chair as Justice Breyer spoke.
[03:15:36.986 --> 03:15:41.107]  He was very upset about this, frowning in apparent disagreement.
[03:15:41.107 --> 03:15:49.529]  For the second time in a week, Justice Alito summarized his dissent from the bench, a signal of his intense disagreement with the majority.
[03:15:49.529 --> 03:16:01.091]  Speaking for about 10 minutes, Justice Alito said the majority had thrown aside standard legal procedures to strike down the Texas law, ignoring rules that should have precluded the court from considering the appeal altogether.
[03:16:02.199 --> 03:16:03.581]  Now, what was the deal with it?
[03:16:03.581 --> 03:16:07.745]  Well, you know, interestingly enough, we see all this stuff out of Brexit.
[03:16:07.745 --> 03:16:09.127]  People saying, we need a do-over.
[03:16:09.127 --> 03:16:10.669]  I'm not happy with the results.
[03:16:10.669 --> 03:16:11.970]  I want to hold another election.
[03:16:11.970 --> 03:16:13.552]  I don't like that.
[03:16:13.552 --> 03:16:14.553]  Okay?
[03:16:14.553 --> 03:16:15.775]  That's essentially what this was.
[03:16:16.741 --> 03:16:22.484]  This, in principle, this whole Supreme Court decision was essentially a do-over for these people.
[03:16:22.484 --> 03:16:24.045]  And that's what he was pointing out.
[03:16:24.045 --> 03:16:29.947]  It was also ignoring the law, also ignoring legal principles, and it was pure activism.
[03:16:29.947 --> 03:16:31.808]  This is not a review of the law.
[03:16:31.808 --> 03:16:33.689]  This is not a review of the Constitution.
[03:16:33.689 --> 03:16:37.771]  This is nothing less than naked judicial activism.
[03:16:37.771 --> 03:16:41.373]  And that's why Justice Alito was rocking back and forth in his seat.
[03:16:41.373 --> 03:16:42.813]  He could barely contain himself.
[03:16:42.813 --> 03:16:45.715]  He could hardly sit there and listen to this nonsense.
[03:16:46.215 --> 03:16:51.880]  And then he wrote this opinion, and I pulled up his opinion, and I want to read you part of it, because these opinions are very long.
[03:16:51.880 --> 03:16:55.063]  This is like 150 pages of stuff to sort through.
[03:16:55.063 --> 03:16:57.204]  This is what he has to say at the beginning of his opinion.
[03:16:57.204 --> 03:17:08.334]  He says, the constitutionality of laws regulating abortion is one of the most controversial issues in American law, but this case does not require us to delve into that contentious dispute.
[03:17:08.334 --> 03:17:09.275]  You understand?
[03:17:09.275 --> 03:17:11.717]  He said, okay, regardless of what you think about
[03:17:12.057 --> 03:17:17.559]  The issue, there are legal principles here that would keep us from being involved in this.
[03:17:17.559 --> 03:17:24.800]  He said, instead, the issue here concerns a workaday question that can arise in any case, no matter the subject.
[03:17:24.800 --> 03:17:29.162]  Namely, whether the present case is barred by res judica.
[03:17:29.162 --> 03:17:31.122]  Okay?
[03:17:31.122 --> 03:17:34.103]  And so what he talks about with that is he's essentially saying, hey, look,
[03:17:35.250 --> 03:17:37.312]  To put that in layman's terms, okay?
[03:17:37.312 --> 03:17:38.713]  Because I'm not a lawyer.
[03:17:38.713 --> 03:17:40.415]  But he explains it in his opinion.
[03:17:40.415 --> 03:17:43.157]  He says it's basically claim preclusion.
[03:17:43.157 --> 03:17:46.240]  It's a bedrock principle, he writes later on in his decision.
[03:17:46.240 --> 03:17:51.565]  He says, if you lose on an issue, you don't get a do-over.
[03:17:51.565 --> 03:17:52.786]  You don't get a do-over.
[03:17:52.786 --> 03:17:55.348]  Just like you don't get a do-over with Brexit.
[03:17:55.348 --> 03:17:56.669]  And he goes on to say here.
[03:17:56.669 --> 03:17:58.771]  He said, here's the worst example.
[03:17:58.771 --> 03:18:01.193]  Shortly after Texas enacted this bill,
[03:18:02.034 --> 03:18:15.619]  The petitioners in this case brought suit, claiming, among other things, that a provision of the new law requiring a physician performing an abortion to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital is facially unconstitutional, and thus totally unenforceable.
[03:18:15.619 --> 03:18:25.502]  Petitioners had a fair opportunity to make their case, but they lost on the merits in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and they chose not to petition the Supreme Court at that time.
[03:18:25.502 --> 03:18:27.043]  So the judgment became final.
[03:18:27.043 --> 03:18:27.603]  So they lost.
[03:18:28.339 --> 03:18:29.359]  They lost.
[03:18:29.359 --> 03:18:33.281]  But then they come back a few years later and say, we want to do over on that, like Brexit.
[03:18:33.281 --> 03:18:33.801]  OK?
[03:18:33.801 --> 03:18:36.302]  This is precisely what is happening with this.
[03:18:36.302 --> 03:18:38.443]  And he goes, you don't get to do that.
[03:18:38.443 --> 03:18:39.944]  This is exactly this case.
[03:18:39.944 --> 03:18:42.085]  This isn't a similar case.
[03:18:42.085 --> 03:18:44.205]  This is exactly that case.
[03:18:44.205 --> 03:18:45.066]  You lost.
[03:18:45.066 --> 03:18:46.106]  You didn't appeal.
[03:18:46.106 --> 03:18:48.807]  You don't get to come back now and do this.
[03:18:48.807 --> 03:18:49.367]  OK?
[03:18:49.367 --> 03:18:56.770]  Under the rules that apply in regular cases, he says, petitioners could not re-litigate the exact same claim in a second suit.
[03:18:56.770 --> 03:18:57.931]  The exact same claim.
[03:18:59.386 --> 03:19:05.890]  As we have said, a losing litigant, and he quotes the Supreme Court, and he gives you book, chapter and verse, okay?
[03:19:05.890 --> 03:19:18.119]  Quote, a losing litigant deserves no rematch after a defeat fairly suffered in adversarial proceedings on an issue identical in substance to the one he subsequently seeks to raise.
[03:19:18.119 --> 03:19:18.599]  You get that?
[03:19:18.599 --> 03:19:19.480]  Okay?
[03:19:19.480 --> 03:19:21.061]  In other words, no do-overs, folks.
[03:19:21.977 --> 03:19:29.663]  Now, he says, however, because this is an abortion case, we throw out the law, we throw out the rules, we throw out all of our previous opinions.
[03:19:29.663 --> 03:19:40.292]  He said, this rule is now disregarded, and the court awards a victory to petitioners on the very exact claim they unsuccessfully pressed in the earlier case.
[03:19:40.292 --> 03:19:42.614]  And when we come back, there's more.
[03:19:42.614 --> 03:19:49.620]  There's more that is ignored on this, and I want to read to you what the Supreme Court decision says, why they said they did this.
[03:19:50.706 --> 03:19:59.272]  It's absolutely amazing, and I think it underscores why we cannot trust nine political appointees to safeguard the Constitution.
[03:19:59.272 --> 03:20:00.312]  That's an idiotic idea.
[03:20:20.866 --> 03:20:21.367]  A U.S.
[03:20:21.367 --> 03:20:26.251]  company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.
[03:20:26.251 --> 03:20:27.893]  It's a home freeze dryer.
[03:20:27.893 --> 03:20:31.156]  With the product, you can preserve the foods your family loves.
[03:20:31.156 --> 03:20:35.560]  And the best part is, the food will last 25 years and still taste great.
[03:20:36.221 --> 03:20:37.962]  I've tried it and it's amazing.
[03:20:37.962 --> 03:20:45.006]  With a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right, you can literally freeze dry anything you eat, even things like ice cream.
[03:20:45.006 --> 03:20:47.808]  To learn more, call Harvest Right today at 800-594-4635 or go to HarvestRight.com.

[03:20:59.855 --> 03:21:00.355]  Not a grip.
[03:21:00.355 --> 03:21:01.816]  You developed Living Defense for us.
[03:21:01.816 --> 03:21:03.116]  It took you over a year to do it.
[03:21:03.116 --> 03:21:04.336]  Why is this so good?
[03:21:04.336 --> 03:21:09.598]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[03:21:09.598 --> 03:21:23.082]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[03:21:23.082 --> 03:21:24.443]  Right now with all the refugees,
[03:21:25.223 --> 03:21:26.884]  Uh, spreading disease around.
[03:21:26.884 --> 03:21:29.426]  We have biological warfare going on everywhere.
[03:21:29.426 --> 03:21:30.727]  These are all parasites.
[03:21:30.727 --> 03:21:31.827]  Tell us about all the stuff that's in it.
[03:21:31.827 --> 03:21:33.148]  There's so many things that are in it.
[03:21:33.148 --> 03:21:37.671]  You have the neem in there, you have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[03:21:37.671 --> 03:21:40.793]  I recommend doing the parasite plans at least twice a year.
[03:21:40.913 --> 03:21:43.955]  All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[03:21:43.955 --> 03:21:45.016]  It just came back in yesterday.
[03:21:45.016 --> 03:21:46.938]  LivingDefense, InfoWarsLive.com.

[03:24:01.400 --> 03:24:07.242]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:07.242 --> 03:24:09.583]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[03:24:09.583 --> 03:24:15.465]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:24:15.465 --> 03:24:18.246]  I'm David Knight on this Monday.
[03:24:18.246 --> 03:24:20.046]  And we're looking at June 27th.
[03:24:20.046 --> 03:24:22.247]  We're looking at the Supreme Court case.
[03:24:22.247 --> 03:24:23.848]  And I wanted to give you an example.
[03:24:25.044 --> 03:24:26.965]  of just how corrupt this whole system is.
[03:24:26.965 --> 03:24:31.247]  I mean, we've got people about Brexit saying, we need a do-over.
[03:24:31.247 --> 03:24:32.908]  I don't like the results.
[03:24:32.908 --> 03:24:37.930]  We've got the Supreme Court actually giving a do-over, which is against their previous rulings.
[03:24:37.930 --> 03:24:40.111]  It's against the law to do this.
[03:24:40.111 --> 03:24:41.492]  These people already lost.
[03:24:41.492 --> 03:24:42.773]  They didn't appeal the case.
[03:24:42.773 --> 03:24:47.075]  But now they gave him a do-over and said, all right, and now we're going to reverse what happened earlier.
[03:24:47.875 --> 03:24:58.620]  And then, of course, in politics, we see over this weekend an orchestrated attempt by the never-Trumper GOP I'm With Her Hillary people, okay?
[03:24:58.620 --> 03:25:03.683]  People like George Will, National Review, David French, the guy that was a candidate for about a week.
[03:25:03.683 --> 03:25:05.744]  They got this guy who's filed suit in Virginia.
[03:25:08.280 --> 03:25:10.562]  They want a do-over as well.
[03:25:10.562 --> 03:25:17.626]  They want to say, hey, we are delegates and we have superior First Amendment rights to you people.
[03:25:17.626 --> 03:25:22.109]  What our opinion is, it matters more than millions of voters in these elections.
[03:25:22.109 --> 03:25:25.131]  And so we're going to say that you can't penalize me.
[03:25:25.131 --> 03:25:26.852]  We're going to sue you over this.
[03:25:26.852 --> 03:25:30.074]  So over and over again, we're seeing people say we want a do-over.
[03:25:30.074 --> 03:25:30.834]  The abortion law.
[03:25:30.834 --> 03:25:31.195]  Brexit.
[03:25:31.835 --> 03:25:33.436]  The GOP convention.
[03:25:33.436 --> 03:25:38.440]  Everybody is saying, hey, I didn't win, and so I'm going to change all the rules right now.
[03:25:38.440 --> 03:25:42.663]  I'm going to say all the rules don't apply, and I'm going to do whatever I have to.
[03:25:42.663 --> 03:25:47.347]  I'm going to suspend your free speech because I don't want to debate science with you when it's climate change.
[03:25:48.047 --> 03:25:54.530]  I don't want to hear what you have to say, so I'm going to call you a hateful racist and shut you down with hate speech laws.
[03:25:54.530 --> 03:26:05.754]  I'm going to do whatever I can to silence, to censor you, to pervert the rule of law, the rules of democracy, the rules of our republic, just so I can get my way.
[03:26:05.754 --> 03:26:07.375]  This is what we're seeing increasingly.
[03:26:07.375 --> 03:26:10.456]  So I want to break this down because, as I pointed out before,
[03:26:11.803 --> 03:26:15.065]  Justice Alito could barely contain his anger.
[03:26:15.065 --> 03:26:19.167]  He was rocking back and forth in his seat, and I would have been too if I had been there.
[03:26:19.167 --> 03:26:20.488]  I would have been going back and forth.
[03:26:20.488 --> 03:26:22.809]  I was like, I can't believe this is happening.
[03:26:22.809 --> 03:26:25.251]  This is just, we're throwing everything out.
[03:26:25.251 --> 03:26:27.052]  And we've seen the Supreme Court do this before.
[03:26:27.052 --> 03:26:29.053]  We saw them do it on gay marriage.
[03:26:29.053 --> 03:26:32.715]  Regardless of what you think about gay marriage, they have no jurisdiction.
[03:26:32.715 --> 03:26:38.418]  Where is it in the Supreme Court that says the federal government will have jurisdiction over defining marriage?
[03:26:38.418 --> 03:26:41.040]  There is nothing in the Constitution that delegates that to them.
[03:26:42.332 --> 03:26:47.013]  We had people who were very concerned who did not want to have a federal government.
[03:26:47.013 --> 03:26:49.454]  The Anti-Federalists, they called them.
[03:26:49.454 --> 03:26:51.014]  They said, we don't want to have this.
[03:26:51.014 --> 03:26:59.456]  We know that this is going to turn into a monster that is going to dictate the most minute details of our lives, assuming and concentrating power to itself.
[03:26:59.456 --> 03:27:01.217]  And that's what's happened.
[03:27:01.217 --> 03:27:02.577]  And so they passed the Bill of Rights.
[03:27:02.577 --> 03:27:06.898]  And they said, this is off limits, that's off limits, that's off limits, that's off limits.
[03:27:06.898 --> 03:27:09.659]  And then they said, oh, and by the way, in case we forgot anything,
[03:27:10.657 --> 03:27:19.482]  We're going to write a 9th and a 10th Amendment, and we're going to say, if we didn't specifically give this power to you specifically, then you don't have it.
[03:27:19.482 --> 03:27:24.404]  Anything that's not been delegated to you remains the power of the people and of the state governments.
[03:27:24.404 --> 03:27:26.605]  That's the 9th and 10th Amendment, essentially.
[03:27:26.605 --> 03:27:28.246]  They just ignore that.
[03:27:28.246 --> 03:27:34.169]  And if they like the cause, the Supreme Court has shown that it will just set aside all the legal process.
[03:27:34.169 --> 03:27:37.171]  And this is why Judge Alito was so upset about this.
[03:27:37.881 --> 03:27:38.821]  And we've had other people on.
[03:27:38.821 --> 03:27:42.402]  We've had Lionel when we were talking about the gay marriage thing.
[03:27:42.402 --> 03:27:43.403]  He thought it was a good deal.
[03:27:43.403 --> 03:27:46.104]  I don't like that definition of marriage.
[03:27:46.104 --> 03:27:50.965]  But we both agreed they don't have any legal authority to define it.
[03:27:50.965 --> 03:27:55.327]  So, I mean, it's something that ought to be decided at the state levels, at the community levels.
[03:27:55.327 --> 03:27:59.088]  Before I get back to that, real quickly, we have a couple of sales that are ending soon.
[03:28:00.179 --> 03:28:01.360]  I want to let you know about these.
[03:28:01.360 --> 03:28:03.962]  That's the 20% off for Deep Cleanse.
[03:28:03.962 --> 03:28:10.787]  And of course, when we put our best seller on a deep discount like this, it isn't going to last long.
[03:28:10.787 --> 03:28:12.969]  And so that sale is not going to last long.
[03:28:12.969 --> 03:28:16.512]  This is our Rolls-Royce, our all-in-one cleansing product.
[03:28:16.512 --> 03:28:22.617]  Instead of buying five, six, or seven different cleansing products, we've used decades of scientific research to put together
[03:28:23.277 --> 03:28:24.237]  Deep Cleanse.
[03:28:24.237 --> 03:28:26.098]  And again, it is our best-selling product.
[03:28:26.098 --> 03:28:27.938]  We've put it on a deep discount.
[03:28:27.938 --> 03:28:29.539]  20% off at InfoWarsLife.com.
[03:28:29.539 --> 03:28:30.759]  That's not going to last much longer.
[03:28:30.759 --> 03:28:33.580]  Also, the Hillary for Prison t-shirts.
[03:28:33.580 --> 03:28:36.000]  That is going to be ending soon as well.
[03:28:36.000 --> 03:28:46.163]  If you get the Hillary for Prison t-shirts, you can get 75% off the Hillary for Prison t-shirts if you sign up for the InfoWars newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[03:28:46.823 --> 03:28:53.164]  We're going to be forced to pull this special very soon because they are going very quickly, you can imagine, at that kind of a discount.
[03:28:53.164 --> 03:28:58.346]  It's a huge discount off of t-shirts that are already very competitively priced for t-shirts.
[03:28:58.346 --> 03:29:11.949]  It is a great design and, to say the least, it will be a conversation starter because, as we've seen many times, many people look at it as such a dead ringer knockoff of the Hillary for President
[03:29:14.009 --> 03:29:27.778]  Appearance but it's Hillary for prison and so that gets a conversation started Let's talk about what's going on with the Supreme Court situation when we come back We're going to take a look at this move to shut down the Trump nomination.
[03:29:27.778 --> 03:29:29.960]  Can you believe that they're still trying to do this?
[03:29:29.960 --> 03:29:43.109]  It's absolutely unbelievable and then we're gonna look at the whiny Millennials who say those baby boomers they are ruining our future and you've seen the memes on social media where they show the inversion that
[03:29:43.969 --> 03:29:49.278]  The vast majority of people who are younger voted to stay in and vice versa at the older age.
[03:29:49.278 --> 03:29:50.660]  We'll be right back.
[03:29:50.660 --> 03:29:53.184]  The Empire's on the run.
[03:29:53.184 --> 03:29:55.869]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:00.552 --> 03:30:03.794]  Finally, the mainstream media is reporting on what we broke two years ago.
[03:30:03.794 --> 03:30:04.174]  The U.S.
[03:30:04.174 --> 03:30:11.598]  Customs and Border Patrol, under pressure from the Obama administration, is purchasing bus tickets for illegals to ship them deeper into the country at taxpayers' expense.
[03:30:11.598 --> 03:30:18.401]  Local news station KRGV is now covering how the McAllen, Texas bus station is used as a transit hub for illegals Obama is bringing into the country.
[03:30:18.561 --> 03:30:23.505]  Which Infowars.com exclusively broke in 2014 when no one else dared to report on it.
[03:30:23.505 --> 03:30:28.209]  KRGV revealed that over 100 illegals a day are being dropped off at the McAllen station.
[03:30:28.209 --> 03:30:35.956]  And, in 2014, Infowars reported on how the Obama administration was ordering the Border Patrol to release illegals they've apprehended after crossing the border.
[03:30:35.956 --> 03:30:44.663]  But, as part of their release, the illegals are transported to the McAllen bus station by Border Patrol agents who then buy them tickets to go wherever they want to go in the U.S.
[03:30:45.003 --> 03:30:48.830]  So, for example, if the illegals have relatives in Boston, that's where they get to go.
[03:30:48.830 --> 03:30:51.976]  And taxpayers are paying for this illegal smuggling operation.
[03:30:51.976 --> 03:30:55.883]  To find out more about Obama's lawlessness, visit InfoWars.com.
[03:30:55.883 --> 03:30:57.165]  This is Kit Daniels reporting.
[03:30:59.833 --> 03:31:01.474]  Clean, pure drinking water.
[03:31:01.474 --> 03:31:02.955]  You can't survive without it.
[03:31:02.955 --> 03:31:04.155]  But where do you get it?
[03:31:04.155 --> 03:31:10.138]  Alexa Pure Pro is a brand new, groundbreaking, gravity-fed water filtration system that is like no other.

[03:31:59.688 --> 03:32:06.170]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[03:32:06.170 --> 03:32:19.175]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[03:32:19.175 --> 03:32:22.496]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[03:32:22.816 --> 03:32:29.798]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:32:29.798 --> 03:32:42.682]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:32:42.682 --> 03:32:44.222]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:32:44.502 --> 03:32:50.912]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[03:32:50.912 --> 03:32:55.058]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:33:09.409 --> 03:33:14.526]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones!
[03:33:19.406 --> 03:33:20.707]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:33:20.707 --> 03:33:26.071]  I'm David Knight, and we're talking about the do-over mentality that we've got here.
[03:33:26.071 --> 03:33:32.435]  The spoiled brats everywhere, from Britain to the Supreme Court to the Republican Party.
[03:33:32.435 --> 03:33:33.836]  I didn't get my way.
[03:33:33.836 --> 03:33:35.277]  I want it done over again.
[03:33:35.277 --> 03:33:36.618]  I don't care what the rules are.
[03:33:36.618 --> 03:33:37.979]  I want it my way.
[03:33:37.979 --> 03:33:39.841]  That's exactly what they're saying.
[03:33:39.841 --> 03:33:42.523]  And that's what Justice Alito was pointing out the Supreme Court just did.
[03:33:43.328 --> 03:33:48.532]  And so to summarize what I was saying earlier, what he did was he said, look, they already appealed this.
[03:33:48.532 --> 03:33:50.893]  They lost at a circuit court level.
[03:33:50.893 --> 03:33:52.454]  They did not appeal it to the Supreme Court.
[03:33:52.454 --> 03:33:54.115]  So that decision was final.
[03:33:54.115 --> 03:34:00.640]  Now they have come back with exactly the same case, exactly the same law, and tried to appeal it again.
[03:34:00.640 --> 03:34:02.681]  They've already lost.
[03:34:02.681 --> 03:34:03.722]  We don't allow that.
[03:34:03.722 --> 03:34:05.563]  The Supreme Court has said that's not allowed.
[03:34:05.563 --> 03:34:06.544]  It's a legal principle.
[03:34:06.544 --> 03:34:07.825]  That's not allowed.
[03:34:07.825 --> 03:34:09.426]  And then he goes on to say, and here's another.
[03:34:10.276 --> 03:34:10.776]  I don't think so.
[03:34:38.988 --> 03:34:50.453]  The court's treatment of this Texas law's severability clause, he says, when part of a statute is held to be unconstitutional, the question arises whether other parts of the statute must also go.
[03:34:50.453 --> 03:34:58.616]  If a statute says the provisions found that are unconstitutional can be severed from the rest of the statute, the valid provisions are allowed to stand.
[03:34:58.616 --> 03:34:59.636]  You understand?
[03:34:59.636 --> 03:35:05.118]  So they come in here and they say, well, you know, we don't like this rule about the fact that you have to be admitted to a hospital.
[03:35:05.118 --> 03:35:06.739]  We think that's too much of a burden.
[03:35:07.423 --> 03:35:08.444]  Okay, fine.
[03:35:08.444 --> 03:35:21.412]  Then the other parts that say you've got to meet fire code inspections if you're going to do medical procedures in this little house that you just bought and you've now put a shingle out, said this is a health clinic for women.
[03:35:21.412 --> 03:35:22.273]  Okay, fine.
[03:35:22.273 --> 03:35:24.774]  Let's make sure they don't burn up while they're being treated there.
[03:35:24.774 --> 03:35:32.059]  Let's make sure that you can get gurneys inside here if somebody has to get pulled out quickly with an ambulance.
[03:35:32.059 --> 03:35:32.879]  Issues like that.
[03:35:32.879 --> 03:35:34.260]  Safety issues.
[03:35:34.260 --> 03:35:36.382]  And he says, for example,
[03:35:37.199 --> 03:35:44.903]  He says, if provisions can be found unconstitutional, can be severed from the rest of the statute, the valid provisions are allowed to stand.
[03:35:44.903 --> 03:35:50.006]  This law contains what surely must be the most emphatic severability clause that was ever written.
[03:35:50.006 --> 03:35:56.669]  In other words, they say in this law, we've got all these different things here, and each one of them is severable.
[03:35:56.669 --> 03:35:59.371]  These are all separate regulations.
[03:35:59.371 --> 03:36:01.752]  It isn't all together, all or nothing.
[03:36:01.752 --> 03:36:03.433]  Each one of these things are separate.
[03:36:04.366 --> 03:36:06.147]  And he says this is very explicit.
[03:36:06.147 --> 03:36:12.993]  He said the clause says every single word of the statute and every possible application of its provisions are severable.
[03:36:12.993 --> 03:36:25.042]  He says provisions that are indisputably constitutional, for example, provisions that require facilities performing abortions to follow basic fire safety measures are stricken now from the book.
[03:36:25.042 --> 03:36:25.662]  Okay?
[03:36:25.662 --> 03:36:27.564]  Based on the Supreme Court decision.
[03:36:27.564 --> 03:36:30.126]  So they took all of the regulations out.
[03:36:31.172 --> 03:36:35.818]  He says there's absolutely no possible justification for this collateral damage.
[03:36:35.818 --> 03:36:41.706]  Now let me read you the nonsense that was put out here by these five Supreme Court justices.
[03:36:41.706 --> 03:36:43.269]  This is the basis for their decision.
[03:36:44.246 --> 03:36:49.531]  The number of facilities providing abortions dropped in half, and this is actually a Supreme Court decision.
[03:36:49.531 --> 03:36:55.016]  This is not a New York Times analysis of what's going on.
[03:36:55.016 --> 03:37:00.922]  This is what the Supreme Court justices said was the basis for their ruling.
[03:37:01.522 --> 03:37:07.346]  The number of facilities providing abortions dropped in half from about 40 to about 20.
[03:37:07.346 --> 03:37:15.132]  This decrease in geographical distribution means that the number of women of reproductive age living more than 50 miles from the clinic has doubled.
[03:37:15.132 --> 03:37:18.855]  The number living more than 100 miles away has increased by 150 percent.
[03:37:18.855 --> 03:37:22.718]  The number living more than 150 miles away by more than 350 percent.
[03:37:22.718 --> 03:37:27.182]  The number living more than 200 miles away by more than 2,800 percent.
[03:37:27.182 --> 03:37:28.883]  You see the issue here?
[03:37:28.883 --> 03:37:29.924]  This is an issue of
[03:37:31.274 --> 03:37:34.182]  Whether or not they like, they want people to have abortions.
[03:37:34.182 --> 03:37:38.533]  It doesn't even address the legal issues that Judge Alito was so upset about.
[03:37:39.690 --> 03:37:53.377]  They just said, well, we like abortions, we want them to be plentiful and easily accessible, and so we don't like this, and we're going to strike all of the rules, including fire safety codes, because, you know, this is about women's health.
[03:37:53.377 --> 03:37:55.198]  This is about women's health, isn't it?
[03:37:55.198 --> 03:37:56.739]  What a baloney!
[03:37:56.739 --> 03:38:02.982]  You know, here are these people who have absolutely no health regulations in abortion clinics.
[03:38:02.982 --> 03:38:04.983]  They struck them all.
[03:38:04.983 --> 03:38:08.745]  Yet they want to regulate every tiny detail of bathrooms.
[03:38:10.540 --> 03:38:13.561]  They don't have an agenda, do they?
[03:38:13.561 --> 03:38:14.961]  No agenda whatsoever.
[03:38:14.961 --> 03:38:16.522]  Look at the University of North Carolina.
[03:38:16.522 --> 03:38:20.183]  Christmas vacation is now a microaggression.
[03:38:20.183 --> 03:38:24.324]  As I pointed out before, this is an article that's up on InfoWars.com from The Daily Caller.
[03:38:24.324 --> 03:38:34.767]  University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill issued a guide this week which instructs students that Christmas vacations and telling a woman, I love your shoes, are microaggressions along with things like boyfriend and girlfriend.
[03:38:34.767 --> 03:38:37.628]  So watch your speech, okay?
[03:38:37.628 --> 03:38:38.268]  Watch your speech.
[03:38:39.192 --> 03:38:42.497]  There's no free speech at this university.
[03:38:42.497 --> 03:38:45.401]  At the same time, again, we're talking about agendas here, okay?
[03:38:45.401 --> 03:38:52.853]  We've got Obama declares the Stonewall Inn to be the first national monument to LGBT rights.
[03:38:52.853 --> 03:38:53.754]  This is from The Guardian.
[03:38:54.687 --> 03:39:09.893]  Barack Obama announced on Friday that the Stonewall National Monument will be created outside the Stonewall Inn in New York, where gay men, lesbians, and drag queens reacted to a police raid in 1969 with a riot that spread and turned into the gay rights movement in America and around the world.
[03:39:09.893 --> 03:39:18.577]  Obama confirmed the widely expected news that he will be designating the first ever national monument to the LGBT equality movement.
[03:39:18.577 --> 03:39:20.217]  Okay, so, here you go.
[03:39:20.217 --> 03:39:20.598]  That's his
[03:39:21.803 --> 03:39:22.784]  That's his monument.
[03:39:22.784 --> 03:39:34.439]  Now, because that's his agenda, that's what he thinks is important, but understand what is happening as he's going in other parts, rural areas of the country.
[03:39:34.439 --> 03:39:38.384]  He's going in and saying, well, this is a very special petroglyph here, for example.
[03:39:39.369 --> 03:40:01.789]  And as I point out, we've done this report, I did it with Rob Jacobson, we need to update it now because they found a lady who was going out and using paint on these petroglyphs and you had Harry Reid blaming it on the Bundy people and all these evil people associated with them and yet we find out that it was like a twenty-something girl who was doing
[03:40:03.386 --> 03:40:12.172]  um... graffiti and actually caught her because she's putting it on facebook okay and doing it with paint over these ancient indian petroglyphs
[03:40:13.979 --> 03:40:14.860]  Obama is coming out.
[03:40:14.860 --> 03:40:27.310]  Not only are they falsely blaming the people that they are destroying their way of life, taking their property rights, taking their grazing rights, their mining rights, their surface and water rights, their logging rights, you name it.
[03:40:27.310 --> 03:40:31.694]  All these rights have been held since these states came into the Union.
[03:40:31.694 --> 03:40:34.496]  And these are property rights, just like your home is a property right.
[03:40:34.496 --> 03:40:35.977]  They're saying, we've got to have that.
[03:40:35.977 --> 03:40:39.200]  We've got to have millions of acres because of a petroglyph over here.
[03:40:39.600 --> 03:40:47.923]  And oh, by the way, those petroglyphs are being vandalized, and we're getting graffiti put on them, and I know it's those Bundy people, I just know it's them.
[03:40:47.923 --> 03:40:49.164]  And it's not.
[03:40:49.164 --> 03:40:53.825]  And they don't need to take millions upon millions of acres in order to protect that.
[03:40:53.825 --> 03:40:57.907]  A good example is one of the earlier monuments that we had in the National Park Service.
[03:40:57.907 --> 03:40:58.967]  We talked about this in the report.
[03:40:58.967 --> 03:40:59.607]  Devil's Tower.
[03:40:59.607 --> 03:41:00.608]  You know Devil's Tower?
[03:41:01.434 --> 03:41:07.158]  The tower that you see in Close Encounters of the Third Kind.
[03:41:07.158 --> 03:41:08.239]  Was it Third Kind?
[03:41:08.239 --> 03:41:08.599]  I think.
[03:41:08.599 --> 03:41:10.180]  Anyway, that's a Spielberg movie.
[03:41:10.180 --> 03:41:11.781]  Not one of my favorites, okay?
[03:41:11.781 --> 03:41:20.368]  But you know, he does the thing of mashed potatoes on the kitchen table and they all have this vision and they all assemble at Devil's Tower.
[03:41:21.718 --> 03:41:28.240]  To preserve Devil's Tower, they needed one and a half acres, about the size of a football field.
[03:41:28.240 --> 03:41:34.561]  And yet they're telling us, because of some of these small petroglyphs, they need literally millions of acres.
[03:41:34.561 --> 03:41:37.022]  They lie about everything!
[03:41:37.022 --> 03:41:41.403]  They lie about the purpose of it, and they lie about why it is needed.
[03:41:41.403 --> 03:41:45.624]  And it's interesting, tomorrow there's going to be a recall election in Burns, Oregon.
[03:41:46.550 --> 03:41:50.193]  Near where that wildlife refuge was taken over by the Bundys.
[03:41:50.193 --> 03:41:53.736]  And the people in that town are very upset with the county judge.
[03:41:53.736 --> 03:41:57.299]  Kind of equivalent to what we have here in Texas, I believe.
[03:41:57.299 --> 03:42:01.402]  The county judge is equivalent to the mayor of a city, okay?
[03:42:01.402 --> 03:42:03.764]  Is to a county what a mayor is to a city.
[03:42:04.324 --> 03:42:05.826]  And there's a recall election there.
[03:42:05.826 --> 03:42:07.968]  A lot of people who are business owners.
[03:42:07.968 --> 03:42:08.689]  Here's one of them.
[03:42:08.689 --> 03:42:17.157]  Linda Gaynor said the business she got from journalists, agents, occupiers, protesters against the occupation and from protesters protesting the protesters.
[03:42:17.157 --> 03:42:18.579]  She said she had a lot of business there.
[03:42:18.579 --> 03:42:20.401]  She said, I met really awesome people.
[03:42:20.401 --> 03:42:23.564]  Everybody that came through was very polite.
[03:42:23.564 --> 03:42:25.766]  And we should have had a meeting there.
[03:42:25.766 --> 03:42:26.907]  And yet this guy
[03:42:28.158 --> 03:42:43.412]  This judge, they're trying to recall, would not allow anyone to have a meeting to talk about how the government was stealing millions of acres and stealing people's property rights that they had had for 150 years in many cases.
[03:42:43.412 --> 03:42:44.854]  And that's the issue, folks.
[03:42:44.854 --> 03:42:46.275]  That truly is the issue.
[03:42:46.275 --> 03:42:50.139]  You've got another business owner who's afraid to put his name out there.
[03:42:50.139 --> 03:42:52.200]  He's afraid of reprisals.
[03:42:52.200 --> 03:42:53.321]  That's an issue of two, isn't it?
[03:42:54.002 --> 03:42:59.686]  In America, we're afraid to speak out publicly because we're afraid of reprisals.
[03:42:59.686 --> 03:43:04.170]  And so they're going to have an election tomorrow to see whether or not that guy is going to be recalled.
[03:43:04.170 --> 03:43:07.072]  I certainly hope that that is going to be the case.
[03:43:07.072 --> 03:43:09.494]  But just look at the fraud that is involved there.
[03:43:09.494 --> 03:43:20.763]  I want to talk about the other whiners and people calling for do-overs, and that's within the political aspect here of the Republican National Committee.
[03:43:21.718 --> 03:43:30.500]  We've had a long time that these people have been moving to try to subvert the elections, just like they are in Britain.
[03:43:30.500 --> 03:43:37.041]  They didn't like the outcome, they didn't like the fact that Trump won, so they said, well, we're going to steal it, and we don't really care what the rules are.
[03:43:37.041 --> 03:43:49.884]  And so now we've got a Virginia delegate who has filed a class action lawsuit this last Friday, challenging a state law, the Virginia law, that binds delegates to support the primary winner at the nominating convention.
[03:43:50.819 --> 03:43:53.920]  He says, and his name is Beau Correll.
[03:43:53.920 --> 03:43:56.521]  He's a Republican National Convention delegate.
[03:43:56.521 --> 03:44:00.222]  He served as one of Ted Cruz's campaign co-chairs in Virginia.
[03:44:00.222 --> 03:44:06.744]  And he's the only named plaintiff in the suit, but he says he's filing it on behalf of all Republicans and all Democrats.
[03:44:06.744 --> 03:44:11.766]  I think we ought to call this the superdelegate lawsuit.
[03:44:11.766 --> 03:44:14.627]  Because what he's trying to do is establish superdelegates.
[03:44:15.546 --> 03:44:16.987]  He says, this is really awful.
[03:44:16.987 --> 03:44:20.370]  He says, I'm a delegate and I don't like Donald Trump.
[03:44:20.370 --> 03:44:25.313]  And I don't like who the millions of Virginia voters picked.
[03:44:25.313 --> 03:44:28.876]  And now my First Amendment choices are being shut down.
[03:44:28.876 --> 03:44:38.643]  And we have a parallel article coming out at the same time, interestingly enough, interestingly enough, from the National Review and from David French.
[03:44:38.643 --> 03:44:40.184]  Remember David French?
[03:44:40.184 --> 03:44:41.906]  He was Bill Kristol's puppet.
[03:44:42.964 --> 03:44:55.596]  Bill Kristol of the Weekly Standard, spelled W-E-A-K, with an E and an A. We were told he had this independent candidate, this guy was really strong, he's going to be a very viable candidate.
[03:44:55.596 --> 03:45:04.925]  Well, David French is nothing but a reporter for National Review and the Weekly Standard, and his candidacy lasted, I think, less than a week.
[03:45:04.925 --> 03:45:07.728]  But now, interestingly enough, for the National Review, he's written
[03:45:08.348 --> 03:45:17.913]  An article saying not a single Republican delegate is bound to Donald Trump, and using the same arguments that this guy in Virginia is using in his lawsuit.
[03:45:17.913 --> 03:45:19.214]  Just a coincidence, I'm sure.
[03:45:19.214 --> 03:45:20.354]  Don't you think?
[03:45:20.354 --> 03:45:24.697]  Nah, no conspiracy here to try to subvert the will of the people in the elections.
[03:45:24.697 --> 03:45:26.338]  No, that would never happen.
[03:45:26.338 --> 03:45:28.038]  Now, this is what the complaint says.
[03:45:28.038 --> 03:45:28.739]  Here's their argument.
[03:45:29.517 --> 03:45:43.274]  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees delegates to the Republican Party and the Democrat Party's national conventions the right to vote their conscience free from government compulsion when participating in selection of their party's presidential nominee.
[03:45:43.274 --> 03:45:46.178]  Nevertheless, the Virginia law acts to strip them of that right
[03:45:46.698 --> 03:45:52.941]  Imposing criminal penalties on delegates who vote for anyone other than the primary winner on the first ballot of a national convention.
[03:45:52.941 --> 03:45:54.762]  Oh, other than the primary winner?
[03:45:54.762 --> 03:45:56.903]  Oh, where did that, how did that happen?
[03:45:56.903 --> 03:45:58.403]  What, you say we had these elections?
[03:45:58.403 --> 03:46:02.265]  We had these things called elections that we used to, you know, honor?
[03:46:02.265 --> 03:46:06.107]  And we spent a lot of money in the state of Virginia to run those elections?
[03:46:06.732 --> 03:46:22.925]  For the Republican Party, and there were certain things that were put out there, assurances to people, like, hey, you know, you vote this, we're going to have, Trump is going to get delegates, or Cruz is going to get delegates, so Trump won the delegates, and then Cruz went around and tried to steal them again, okay?
[03:46:22.925 --> 03:46:25.006]  What is the problem with this?
[03:46:25.006 --> 03:46:31.671]  Why is it that we can say, well, here's the election, these are the number of votes that Donald Trump got, he won Virginia,
[03:46:32.833 --> 03:46:45.656]  Overwhelmingly, like these other states, and then we say, but wait a minute, now that Ted Cruz has come in and oiled his way across the floor, and whined and dined at these people, now they're not going to vote the way the voters wanted.
[03:46:45.656 --> 03:46:55.718]  Okay, so I would ask Bo Corle, and I would ask the GOP, what makes you think that you're so much better than everybody else?
[03:46:55.718 --> 03:46:58.138]  And I would say that really what needs to be done, they filed a
[03:47:01.702 --> 03:47:08.169]  A part of their lawsuit said that they were worried that Donald Trump would file a lawsuit against them.
[03:47:08.169 --> 03:47:18.139]  They say, because Donald Trump, they said, is quote, known to be litigious and has brought lawsuits of questionable merit against persons for the apparent purpose of harassing or punishing them.
[03:47:18.139 --> 03:47:21.122]  And I said, wait a minute, isn't that what this lawsuit is?
[03:47:21.903 --> 03:47:25.946]  Isn't this a litigious, frivolous lawsuit?
[03:47:25.946 --> 03:47:36.654]  Isn't this a means of harassing and punishing the voters of Virginia who didn't vote the way this little clique of elitists that think that they are the GOP party?
[03:47:36.654 --> 03:47:41.438]  No, the GOP party is the voters and they're going to find this out if they try to do this.
[03:47:41.438 --> 03:47:48.464]  Now, they say that, he says, I just can't follow in my own conscience, I just can't vote for Trump.
[03:47:48.464 --> 03:47:49.725]  It's like, fine, don't go.
[03:47:50.643 --> 03:47:51.143]  Don't go.
[03:47:51.143 --> 03:47:52.124]  You can leave.
[03:47:52.124 --> 03:47:53.385]  Let somebody else take your place.
[03:47:53.385 --> 03:47:55.026]  They have alternates.
[03:47:55.026 --> 03:48:03.271]  And you have to understand, as I pointed out before, when you go to the Electoral College, it's a winner-take-all, state-by-state.
[03:48:03.271 --> 03:48:10.136]  So, if Hillary Clinton wins Texas, she's got a slate of electors from Texas who are going to go to the Electoral College.
[03:48:10.136 --> 03:48:13.458]  Same thing for the Republican candidate, for Donald Trump, okay?
[03:48:13.458 --> 03:48:16.180]  He's got a slate of Trump electors who are going to go there.
[03:48:17.262 --> 03:48:19.783]  And that's what people expect.
[03:48:19.783 --> 03:48:21.344]  That's what it says in the law.
[03:48:21.344 --> 03:48:25.146]  That's what it says in the bylaws of the Republican Party.
[03:48:25.146 --> 03:48:27.667]  So the Republican Party's rules and laws say that.
[03:48:27.667 --> 03:48:32.429]  The state's laws say that because they paid to run this election for these people.
[03:48:32.429 --> 03:48:45.336]  And it is nothing but racketeering and corruption for them to lie to the American people and to say, here's our election, and then come around the back door and say, but no, we had another election and our decision
[03:48:45.996 --> 03:48:47.296]  Matters more than your decision.
[03:48:47.296 --> 03:48:49.317]  That's what we're seeing in the Democrat Party as well.
[03:48:49.317 --> 03:48:51.077]  They call it the superdelegates there.
[03:48:51.077 --> 03:48:53.878]  But now we're seeing that in the Republican Party.
[03:48:53.878 --> 03:48:59.939]  Now let's talk about Brexit, because we got a bunch of whining people who want to break the rules there as well.
[03:48:59.939 --> 03:49:03.780]  You got the Millennials venting fury at the baby boomers.
[03:49:03.780 --> 03:49:05.141]  This is a Daily Mail article.
[03:49:05.141 --> 03:49:07.821]  They say 72% of the 18 to 24 year olds voted against Brexit.
[03:49:10.956 --> 03:49:28.239]  And of course you've seen, if you look at social media, you've seen on Twitter and on Facebook, you've seen the graphic that says, you know, age of the people and how many of them voted to remain, how many of them voted to leave, and they say, look at the life expectancy of these people.
[03:49:28.239 --> 03:49:36.081]  And they go down, they show the older people voted to leave, and they say, look at this, they don't have to live with this decision, it's the young people who have to live with this decision.
[03:49:37.130 --> 03:49:38.651]  This is so unfair!
[03:49:38.651 --> 03:49:40.492]  I want another vote!
[03:49:40.492 --> 03:49:41.392]  Okay.
[03:49:41.392 --> 03:49:51.317]  Well, let me say to the young people out there that the reason the older people voted to leave is because they have lived with that decision.
[03:49:51.317 --> 03:49:52.898]  They made that decision.
[03:49:52.898 --> 03:49:53.878]  The baby boomers did.
[03:49:53.878 --> 03:49:57.720]  They were part of a generation that made that decision back in 1975.
[03:49:57.720 --> 03:49:59.381]  They said, we're not going to leave.
[03:49:59.381 --> 03:50:00.662]  There was a decision then.
[03:50:01.656 --> 03:50:14.501]  Voted overwhelmingly to remain in, and again, this is a story that I covered on Friday from The Telegraph, Tim Stanley, the day the British people defied their jailers.
[03:50:14.501 --> 03:50:20.483]  And he pointed out, he said, David Cameron only called this in order to hold his own party together.
[03:50:20.483 --> 03:50:25.205]  Once it was called, he decided to turn the British and the global establishment against it.
[03:50:26.275 --> 03:50:32.961]  Out came the Treasury, the IMF, even the President of the United States to argue that Britain had to stay.
[03:50:32.961 --> 03:50:42.569]  This was textbook politics, how things used to be done, and it did work back in 1975 when the UK voted overwhelmingly on good advice to stay in the common market.
[03:50:43.308 --> 03:50:44.969]  But what have they found now?
[03:50:44.969 --> 03:50:48.330]  They have found that this is not an economic union.
[03:50:48.330 --> 03:50:50.751]  It is a political union.
[03:50:50.751 --> 03:50:53.132]  They found they lost their sovereignty.
[03:50:53.132 --> 03:50:56.754]  And when they lost their sovereignty, they got a bad deal economically.
[03:50:56.754 --> 03:51:00.196]  They got a bad deal with everything, with immigration, the rest of it.
[03:51:00.196 --> 03:51:00.956]  Stay with us.
[03:51:00.956 --> 03:51:07.099]  Do you or someone you know suffer from chest pain, blood pressure, cholesterol, or irregular heartbeat?
[03:51:07.819 --> 03:51:12.203]  Are you looking for a more natural solution to overcome these health challenges?
[03:51:12.203 --> 03:51:14.164]  You hear the ads all the time.
[03:51:14.164 --> 03:51:17.727]  If this stuff's so good, why doesn't my doctor prescribe it?
[03:51:17.727 --> 03:51:18.588]  That's easy.
[03:51:18.588 --> 03:51:21.050]  There's more money in treating symptoms.
[03:51:21.050 --> 03:51:27.495]  Xtendivite Heart Tonic does want you to be as healthy as you can be, and it really works.
[03:51:27.495 --> 03:51:32.539]  Take Xtendivite for six months and your doctor will say, I don't know what you're doing, but don't stop.
[03:51:32.539 --> 03:51:33.320]  It's working for you.
[03:51:34.080 --> 03:51:36.483]  Get the dependability of ExtendoVite.
[03:51:36.483 --> 03:51:38.785]  Just see how you feel in six months.

[03:52:00.011 --> 03:52:06.475]  More than two years ago, InfoWars first told you about our research into what has been called the Iodine Conspiracy.
[03:52:06.475 --> 03:52:19.104]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can devastate IQ, and how the government knowingly started taking iodine out of the food and adding fluoride, a bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[03:52:19.424 --> 03:52:23.066]  They took the good halogen out and put the deadly halogen in.
[03:52:23.066 --> 03:52:30.029]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[03:52:30.029 --> 03:52:42.855]  Now, in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation ever concerning iodine.
[03:52:42.855 --> 03:52:44.396]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[03:52:44.696 --> 03:52:51.063]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to any optimum health regimen.
[03:52:51.063 --> 03:52:55.969]  Stock up on Survival Shield X2 today at Infowarslife.com or by calling 888-253-3139.
[03:52:59.753 --> 03:53:01.115]  Hi, this is Ron Paul.
[03:53:01.115 --> 03:53:05.259]  I'm a former 22-year congressman and Republican presidential candidate.
[03:53:05.259 --> 03:53:08.983]  I'm here to tell you about something that just might save your lives.
[03:53:08.983 --> 03:53:13.848]  You never know when there will be another Katrina, an economic collapse, or a serious drought.
[03:53:13.848 --> 03:53:17.511]  We should all have a little food storage that will carry us through tough times.
[03:53:17.511 --> 03:53:19.814]  I'm going to tell you about a great way to do that.
[03:53:20.314 --> 03:53:20.815]  A U.S.
[03:53:20.815 --> 03:53:25.682]  company named Harvest Right has a kitchen appliance that can help you be prepared.
[03:53:25.682 --> 03:53:27.324]  It's a home freeze dryer.
[03:53:27.324 --> 03:53:30.608]  With the product, you can preserve the foods your family loves.
[03:53:30.608 --> 03:53:35.014]  And the best part is, the food will last 25 years and still taste great.
[03:53:35.675 --> 03:53:37.416]  I've tried it and it's amazing.
[03:53:37.416 --> 03:53:44.458]  With a home freeze dryer from Harvest Right, you can literally freeze dry anything you eat, even things like ice cream.

[03:54:08.618 --> 03:54:09.919]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[03:54:09.919 --> 03:54:12.062]  On this Monday, June 27, 2016, I'm David Knight.
[03:54:12.062 --> 03:54:16.706]  And I want to get back to these whiners and Brexit.
[03:54:16.706 --> 03:54:17.947]  Saying they want a do-over.
[03:54:17.947 --> 03:54:19.829]  I didn't like the legal process.
[03:54:19.829 --> 03:54:20.690]  I didn't like the results.
[03:54:20.690 --> 03:54:23.213]  You're only talking about being a 4% differential.
[03:54:23.213 --> 03:54:24.614]  No, really, it's 4% more.
[03:54:26.596 --> 03:54:31.022]  Then the 48% that leave got, that remain got, okay?
[03:54:31.022 --> 03:54:33.365]  So that's about a twelfth.
[03:54:33.365 --> 03:54:34.787]  So that's 8%.
[03:54:34.787 --> 03:54:38.973]  So it's 8% more people voted to get out than wanted to stay in.
[03:54:38.973 --> 03:54:40.194]  Four points, but 8% more votes.
[03:54:41.923 --> 03:54:43.404]  I'm going to get back to that real quickly.
[03:54:43.404 --> 03:54:46.727]  We have a couple of sales that are going to be ending soon.
[03:54:46.727 --> 03:54:51.952]  One of those, of course, is the Hillary for Prison t-shirt sale.

[03:55:20.780 --> 03:55:20.860]  20% off.
[03:55:22.401 --> 03:55:25.104]  And let me read you one of the many reviews.
[03:55:25.104 --> 03:55:28.167]  There are hundreds of reviews that you'll find on our website talking about it.
[03:55:28.167 --> 03:55:30.129]  This person says, I would buy this over and over again.
[03:55:30.129 --> 03:55:34.473]  This is Christian from an undisclosed location.
[03:55:34.473 --> 03:55:35.994]  Says, bought it for my uncle.
[03:55:35.994 --> 03:55:37.155]  He loves results.
[03:55:37.155 --> 03:55:38.357]  Long time smoker.
[03:55:38.357 --> 03:55:39.257]  Also a truck driver.
[03:55:39.257 --> 03:55:42.621]  Not the healthiest lifestyle, but within two weeks he felt a lot better.
[03:55:43.081 --> 03:55:46.742]  More energy and also helped him to lose a little weight.
[03:55:46.742 --> 03:55:47.902]  Take a look at the reviews there.
[03:55:47.902 --> 03:55:54.783]  Take a look at the product and take advantage of this deep discount on Deep Cleanse.
[03:55:54.783 --> 03:55:58.324]  20% off at Infowarslife.com.
[03:55:58.324 --> 03:56:01.185]  Now as I was pointing out, let me go back and look at this.
[03:56:01.185 --> 03:56:04.985]  The people who remember this are the ones who voted to get this out.
[03:56:04.985 --> 03:56:07.306]  They have lived under this for 40 years.
[03:56:07.306 --> 03:56:08.266]  The Millennials haven't.
[03:56:09.090 --> 03:56:17.014]  There's this thing called experience, and I know that the kids who are in college and in high school don't really understand what experience is yet, okay?
[03:56:17.014 --> 03:56:19.736]  Think of it as a kind of college degree.
[03:56:20.936 --> 03:56:26.019]  A kind of an advanced graduate degree that takes you decades to get, okay?
[03:56:26.019 --> 03:56:29.180]  That might help it a little bit for you to swallow these results.
[03:56:29.180 --> 03:56:32.142]  And let me tell you, these people have seen it all before.
[03:56:32.142 --> 03:56:34.803]  There was a referendum back in 1975.
[03:56:34.803 --> 03:56:39.406]  In that referendum, two-thirds of the voters voted to stay in the EU.
[03:56:39.406 --> 03:56:45.208]  Within just a few years, this is an article from QZ.com, Britain's love-hate relationship with the EU.
[03:56:45.208 --> 03:56:49.611]  They say, within a few years, they began tracking public opinion on the EU and Britain.
[03:56:50.211 --> 03:56:57.219]  They say by 1979, just four years later, it became clear that voters had begun to regret their 1975 decision.
[03:56:57.219 --> 03:57:03.166]  60% said they would vote to leave the EU if another referendum was called, while only 32% said they would stay.
[03:57:03.166 --> 03:57:04.928]  It has only gotten worse since then.
[03:57:05.967 --> 03:57:11.528]  And that's the reason why those old geezers voted to ruin your future.
[03:57:11.528 --> 03:57:14.089]  No, they saw what has happened here.
[03:57:14.089 --> 03:57:19.670]  They know that the EU has shut down fishermen from fishing in your own waters.
[03:57:19.670 --> 03:57:25.231]  They know that they have micromanaged every detail of your life, as we pointed out before.
[03:57:25.231 --> 03:57:28.092]  They know that it isn't an issue of racism.
[03:57:28.092 --> 03:57:32.073]  It isn't an issue of an economic leap into darkness.
[03:57:32.073 --> 03:57:33.533]  It is an issue of sovereignty.
[03:57:34.659 --> 03:57:41.681]  If you give up control of your life, your political control, then that is not a leap into darkness.
[03:57:41.681 --> 03:57:48.642]  You are marching into a known economic oblivion, because these people will control your economy.
[03:57:48.642 --> 03:57:53.363]  It's precisely what we're looking at with the Trans-Pacific and the Trans-Atlantic partnerships.
[03:57:53.363 --> 03:57:58.885]  You're going to have people who are unelected who are going to be controlling every aspect of your economy.
[03:57:58.885 --> 03:58:00.165]  That's called sovereignty.
[03:58:00.885 --> 03:58:06.749]  And they're going to do things like open your borders and bring in workers as they export your jobs to other areas.
[03:58:06.749 --> 03:58:13.453]  They're going to say, we're going to favor this country when they manufacture this good, but if you try to do that, we're going to shut you down.
[03:58:14.298 --> 03:58:14.998]  They've seen that.
[03:58:14.998 --> 03:58:16.359]  They've seen it for 40 years.
[03:58:16.359 --> 03:58:18.881]  That's why they said, we don't want this anymore.
[03:58:18.881 --> 03:58:21.062]  That's why they said, we're getting out.
[03:58:21.062 --> 03:58:27.006]  And he says, oh no, by the way, don't call people stupid losers when you don't agree with them.
[03:58:27.006 --> 03:58:31.348]  And don't try to throw away the rules because you don't get your way.
[03:58:31.348 --> 03:58:35.351]  Join us tonight, InfoWars Nightly News, 7 o'clock, 7 Central, 8 p.m.
[03:58:35.351 --> 03:58:35.611]  Eastern.
