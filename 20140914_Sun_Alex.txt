[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.440]   I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of
[00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.800]   tyranny over the mind of man. Thomas Jefferson. It's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.000]   radio network.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:29.520]   Welcome, welcome, welcome everyone out there listening to my voice. This is the
[00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:33.320]   Alex Jones show. We're gonna be here live for the next two hours till 4 p.m.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.640]   Central. You can catch us every day during the week 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central
[00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.400]   and it's the Alex Jones show. I'm your host Rob Doo and we've got quite a show
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.240]   for you. Next segment we're gonna have Paul Watson coming in through Skype, the
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.920]   magic of Skype from across the river. We're gonna be talking about Ebola. I
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.640]   have a whole plethora of information on Ebola that we're gonna be covering from
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.760]   the government's preparation that they're not telling you about to the
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.800]   fact that they've known this thing can be airborne and for at least 25 years
[00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.680]   they've known this and we're gonna go over all that coming up. We've got quite
[00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.200]   a show for you. We're gonna be covering the latest ISIS news. If you don't know
[00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.480]   that ISIS has released a third professional quality beheading video.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.040]   This guy's a Brit. We're gonna be covering that and what it means. They've
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.920]   released tons of videos before of them capturing Syrians and Iraqis and cutting
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.040]   their heads off and decapitating them but these videos that really don't show
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.840]   any of the the brutal carnage of it seem to really hit home with the American
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.760]   public and the government. There's the article today on Infowars.com. There's
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.960]   yesterday video ISIS reportedly behead the British aid worker and then they
[00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.180]   bring up another one saying they're gonna do him next. And Ebola news we have
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.760]   four doctors now in the United States who are to have recovered. One's in
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.400]   Atlanta. One's up in Nebraska. So they're importing this stuff everywhere just as
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.560]   Alex Jones predicted. They're gonna be importing Ebola all into the United
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.240]   States and they're literally flushing the waste down the toilet into the
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.360]   public sewer system. We're gonna be going over that. In addition to ISIS we've got
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:19.600]   a little bit of NFL news I might cover. We've got both sides of the aisle coming
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.160]   back with ISIS saying we got to attack. We got to attack. So this is both sides
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.360]   ramping up for war. You've got it in Britain. People who were normally for
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.760]   individual sovereignty and freedom. People like Nigel Farage are now saying
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.480]   we have to give up our liberty for security and that's gonna be the call as
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.040]   we march towards this global new world order. Like I said I'm Rob Dues. This is my
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.160]   first time to be hosting the show like this. I'm very honored to be doing it.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.240]   Just a quick quick bio about myself. I've always been a person that's like to look
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:57.280]   behind the curtain. And back when I was in college I picked up these two books
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.960]   here. One's None Dare Call a Conspiracy by Gary Allen and the other one is Who
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.480]   Runs Congress and that was from the Ralph Nader Congress project. Both books
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.160]   were instrumental in my waking up to what's really going on. Not the left
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.120]   right paradigm that most people are caught in but to the global crime
[00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.320]   syndicate and how it operates here in America and how it operates worldwide.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:25.800]   It's not just here that it's operating it's going all over the place. We're
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.480]   gonna have quite a show for you today. Like I said Paul Watson is gonna be
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.440]   coming up in the next hour and if anybody knows about Ebola and where it's
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.360]   going it's Paul Watson. He's been on this since the beginning. We've been writing
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.120]   articles about Ebola for a long time here at InfoWars.com trying to show the
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.200]   progression of this. And one thing I want to I want to go to here in a second is
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.600]   this video model that has been coming out that came out on the 10th of
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.040]   September. There's a video model showing how it would spread and now they're
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.760]   saying it's gonna kill about 5 million people. Well in this model and you guys
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.920]   can bring it up anytime if you're watching on Prison Planet TV TV you can
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:12.280]   see it it starts in Africa. When it comes over to the to our hemisphere it starts
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.840]   in Cuba and it's interesting that Cuba has just sent a bunch of doctors to go
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.640]   help and then it moves into Florida and then into the United States through
[00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.280]   Miami. So that's very interesting how this model took into account all this
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.360]   stuff and and it's really looking at it's pretty scary how this stuff is all
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.200]   gonna spread. And we're gonna be right back one minute break I'm your host Rob
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.800]   Doo we're gonna be back with Paul Joseph Watson talking about Ebola and a whole
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.520]   host of issues that you should be concerned about. So call your friends get
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.120]   ready strap yourselves in it's gonna be two more hours we'll be right back.
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:05:03.320]   From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming
[00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.240]   more and more toxic each and every day. But it's not just the air outside that's
[00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.400]   toxic. Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations
[00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.440]   of pollutants than even outdoor air. And most Americans spend 90% of their time
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.520]   inside using toxic chemicals within their homes. There are more than 42
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.600]   million smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand types of mold and
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   mildew linked to numerous conditions. And don't forget the fact that 6 million
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.760]   Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well. When I began to
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.840]   research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.000]   lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.040]   we can fight back against. Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:47.440]   manufactured in the USA. The new InfoWars Life Lung Cleanse is here in a
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:50.640]   convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic
[00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.880]   environment. Now available exclusively at InfoWarsLife.com or by calling toll
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.440]   free 888-253-3139.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:11.440]   Live from Austin Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.560]   We're back live on the Alex Jones show. We're gonna be here till 4 p.m. Central. You can
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:37.680]   find us at InfoWars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com/show
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.120]   if you want to watch our free live video feed. We're gonna have some video
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.360]   clips here that you are gonna want to see if you are near a computer. Call your
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:51.120]   friends let them know to tune in. And we have on the line via Skype over across
[00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.920]   in England it's Paul Joseph Watson writer of PrisonPlanet.com, InfoWars.com
[00:06:55.920 --> 00:07:01.920]   and somewhat of a video star now. He's making his own videos putting them out
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.840]   there putting the information out there and let me tell you if the future is if
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.480]   I can gain anything from watching my children they love to watch little
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.680]   videos on YouTube. That is the way we're going to wake up a lot of people and my
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.760]   kids bring me stuff all the time and show it to me because once you've been
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:24.960]   planted the seeds of freedom and liberty there's no stopping it. That's all we
[00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.480]   have to do is plant a seed that's our job here and that's what we do here. Paul
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.000]   how you doing today? Good Rob good to be on the air with you today. All right well
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   let's get right into Ebola. We've got four doctors now killed in Sierra Leone
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.200]   we've got four doctors that we brought here into the United States. Where's all
[00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:49.040]   this going? Well it's it's going towards hopefully answering the question which
[00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:53.280]   I've had since the very beginning when this started and when I started writing
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.960]   articles and making videos about it which is why are all these health
[00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:01.920]   workers being infected with Ebola? Of course we're told that this strain which
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:08.240]   is a new strain of the virus can only be contracted by exchanging bodily fluids
[00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:12.880]   so the health work is actually touching the bodily fluids of the Ebola victims.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:16.960]   Now you've seen the hazmat suits that they wear the precautions that they take
[00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:21.480]   obviously they go to extreme measures to prevent that from happening not just the
[00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:25.000]   doctors in Africa but the American doctors who have taken the same
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.920]   precautions and still caught the virus. So now the WHO for example reports today
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:35.560]   or a couple of days ago unprecedented number of medical staff infected with
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:40.200]   Ebola. The outbreak of Ebola virus disease in West Africa is unprecedented
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.400]   in many ways including the high proportion of doctors, nurses and other
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:48.320]   health workers who have been infected. So 240 health workers in these West
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:53.320]   African countries Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria, Sierra Leone have been infected with
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:58.080]   Ebola more than 120 have died. So again this raises the question if they're
[00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:02.320]   taking all these precautions to prevent the exchange of bodily fluids to catch
[00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:07.880]   the virus then why are they contracting Ebola unless this new strain of Ebola
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.120]   may at least to a limited extent have gone airborne because we know
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:19.400]   the 2012 study which we cited many times from Canada they took pigs who were
[00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:25.480]   infected with Ebola put them in a pen with monkeys that was separated by a
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.520]   wire fence so no direct contact between the two species and basically what
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.720]   happened most of the monkeys contracted Ebola via the respiratory system and
[00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.800]   died from it and that was back in 2012 so they proved back then that Ebola had
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:47.240]   gone airborne between these two species at least to a limited degree. So now as
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.160]   far back as six weeks ago we were asking the same question we were called
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.880]   conspiracy theorists for doing so. I appeared on CBS radio with Dick Morris
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:03.960]   on August 6 last month and then a couple of days after that CBS local news came
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:08.200]   out with a story saying conspiracy theorists claims Ebola may be airborne
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.800]   which is interesting because as of two days ago Michael Osterholm who is
[00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:17.280]   director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.880]   University of Minnesota wrote this big op-ed in the New York Times in which he
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:27.120]   said that basically health workers and experts are loath to consider they fear
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.360]   even considering the fact that quote Ebola virus could mutate to become
[00:10:31.360 --> 00:10:36.200]   transmissible through the air so now six weeks after we first talked about it
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:40.280]   we're getting top experts saying the same thing we were called conspiracy
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.800]   theorists at the time for saying this now top experts doctors medical
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:48.440]   professionals are starting to ask the same question which is has this new
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.240]   strain of Ebola gone airborne because it's unprecedented in the amount of
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.840]   people that it has infected in fact Michael Osterholm said that quote the
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.840]   current Ebola virus is hyper evolution is unprecedented there has been more
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:06.680]   human to human transmission in the past four months than likely occurred in the
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:11.720]   last 500 to 1,000 years each new infection represents trillions of
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:16.280]   throws of the genetic dice so this is completely unprecedented which is why
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.480]   we're asking the question has it gone airborne at least to a limited extent
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.320]   well Paul before you go any farther we've got a video clip that I found over
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:29.680]   the weekend one of our excellent tipsters and we got so many tipsters out
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:33.440]   there that just send us tip after tip after tip this one is from a Nova
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.440]   program that aired in the mid 90s but it talks about an incident that happened in
[00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   1989 here in Virginia and it's between air air transmission of Ebola between
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:52.080]   monkeys and you guys got that clip let's roll it in 1989 Ebola made its way to
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:57.680]   the US residents of this Washington DC suburb had no idea that one of the
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.880]   world's deadliest viruses had emerged in their midst
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:12.760]   in a primate quarantine unit in Reston Virginia monkeys and one of the holding
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:19.560]   rooms suddenly began to die secretly a military team entered the quarantine
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:25.080]   unit and killed all 60 monkeys in the infected room
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:28.680]   [Music]
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:39.400]   the crisis heightened as monkeys began to die in a different room it appeared
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:44.880]   that the virus was moving through the ventilating system in response the
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:52.000]   military killed all 400 monkeys ending the outbreak this new strain of Ebola
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.320]   had shown the potential to spread through the air had it been lethal in
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:13:02.440]   humans it could have been catastrophic there you go Paul so they've been this
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:07.280]   has been on the radar since 1989 at least with the military secretly because
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   no one else knew about it and what do you have to say about that well that's
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:16.000]   amazing of course because I mean we had the Canadian study but that was only
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.160]   from two years ago so to hear that it's you know at least one strain between two
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.600]   species of monkeys has been airborne since 1989 is again is shocking and this
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.000]   is what I've said over and over again you know I can talk about this until I'm
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.280]   blue in the face I'm just the journalist I'm just writing about it I'm not an
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.880]   expert on it we need actual experts and infectious disease specialists to be
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:42.120]   looking into this possibility because it seems like it it could be a good
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.880]   explanation for the for the aggressiveness of how this virus has
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:50.720]   spread but as Osterholm said in the New York Times the other day they're kind of
[00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:55.160]   scared of yelling fire in a crowded theater because they think that it's
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:59.640]   gonna it's gonna cause hysteria and mass panic which is interesting because you
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.080]   know the pharmaceutical industry normally loves hysteria and mass panic
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:08.400]   because it sells drugs and it sells vaccines which is what we saw in 2009
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:13.120]   with the swine flu outbreak which was very different of course because they
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.400]   already had the vaccine lined up and they created a huge huge scare I mean at
[00:14:18.400 --> 00:14:22.600]   the time that there was talk of troops on the streets and martial law and this
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:27.200]   was in the newspapers every day and they had the vaccine lined up probably
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:31.600]   millions of people globally took the vaccine which was completely unnecessary
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:36.680]   swine flu was only really a danger to sick people young people and the elderly
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.000]   so that the majority of the global population was under no risk whatsoever
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.520]   but they sold this drug in huge quantities and it was engendered off the
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:50.600]   back of hysteria created by governments and the pharmaceutical industry which
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:55.880]   we're not seeing in this case because they've been very slow to develop a
[00:14:55.880 --> 00:15:01.040]   vaccine or a drug to treat Ebola which many people have suggested is because
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:06.280]   you know basically people don't give a damn about black people in Africa dying
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:11.040]   from this and it's kind of there's no profit in it in fact we've seen top
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:16.200]   experts come out and admit dr. Ben Newman said I think it was to Bloomberg
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:20.360]   quote there isn't enough panic to justify a cure so there's not enough
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:25.480]   money in it to justify intense research into vaccines and drugs so basically
[00:15:25.480 --> 00:15:29.360]   they're just gonna let it proliferate and now we've got other experts as I
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.640]   reported on Friday and this was quite a bizarre story because they changed the
[00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:38.720]   story after we reported it this was Yona Schmidt Channes it of the Bernard

[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.880]   a vaccine with the help of the Gates Foundation don't worry they're gonna

[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:54.240]   we've got Bill Gates coming to the rescue he's gonna give 50 million
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:21:00.680]   dollars to fight Ebola then we have Glaxo Smith Klein who has a vaccine
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:06.800]   that's been fast-tracked for clinical trials Glaxo Smith Klein these are the
[00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:16.800]   same people that in 2012 were fined only 400,000 pesos for killing 14 babies in
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:22.280]   Argentina for tests they did on an ammonia vaccine so I guess we can all be
[00:21:22.280 --> 00:21:26.920]   assured that since it's Glaxo Smith Klein they're gonna do good at making
[00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:35.000]   this Ebola vaccine and one more thing Paul do you did you see this over the
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.520]   weekend this is published on September 12th Lakeland Industries announces
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:45.640]   global availability of hazmat suits for Ebola and the president and chief CEO
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:49.000]   the CEO of Lakeland Industries came out and said that the State Department had
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.280]   put in a bid for a hundred and sixty thousand suits the State Department is
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:57.800]   getting a hundred sixty thousand hazmat suits to protect from something that now
[00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:03.560]   might even be going airborne Paul what do you make of all this madness well
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:07.440]   it's interesting isn't it I mean a hundred and sixty thousand suits and
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.960]   it's the State Department that's making the purchase you would think that it
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:15.800]   would be the CDC but that suggests it's some kind of national security issue or
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:19.600]   a health aid organization that's gonna send people to Africa no it's this is
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:23.920]   the State Department exactly I mean that's that's concerning and it ties
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:28.080]   into what we've reported before which of course probably about six weeks ago
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:32.080]   Obama signed this amendment to an executive order which was originally
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:37.760]   signed by Bush to deal with SARS to detain forcibly detain Americans who
[00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:42.320]   show signs of respiratory illness merely signs of respiratory illness and then we
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:46.680]   already had the CDC measures which were in place before that which allowed for
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:51.960]   the quarantine of quote well persons who quote do not show symptoms of the disease
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:57.320]   so again it's this medical martial law scenario you've also got the model state
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:01.640]   emergency health powers act which the Association of American Physicians and
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:06.720]   Surgeons one could turn governors into dictators that's another quote so you've
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:10.640]   got this system that's already in in built and ingrained ready to be turned
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:16.760]   on in the case of a pandemic of this nature and yeah that's of concern at the
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:20.960]   State Department buying a hundred and sixty thousand hazmat suits with this
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:26.120]   Ebola virus raging with speculation that it may have gone airborne so it's it's
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:30.640]   of extreme concern and then you mentioned Bill Gates which reminded me
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:35.640]   of the whole eugenics angle dr. Charles onsen head of the biodesign Institute
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:40.560]   for infectious diseases and vaccinology and he was one of the guys who worked on
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:44.520]   the experimental Ebola treatment which the two Americans who flew into Atlanta
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.920]   received he jokes at a conference I believe it was a couple of years ago the
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:55.120]   the the key to solving overpopulation was to create a genetically engineered
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:59.760]   virus that could kill two billion people and these are the people that are
[00:23:59.760 --> 00:24:04.280]   creating the very vaccines which are going to be doled out to people if this
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:08.520]   hysteria gets any bigger and he's joking about oh we need a genetically engineered
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.640]   virus to kill two billion people to solve overpopulation which we know is a
[00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:18.080]   complete statistical lie if you actually delve down into the figures right go
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.680]   population is going to keep going Bill Gates has gone on television with Ted TV
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:26.200]   putting his little equation up there this is one of these things has to go to
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:30.960]   zero and it's people that are gonna go to zero that's what he wants to see I
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:36.280]   mean it's that's it I mean Bill Gates is a eugenicist his dad was part of
[00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:41.000]   Planned Parenthood and the apple doesn't fall far from the tree it would seem but
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.080]   here's another interesting fact that these patients were bringing in to the
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:48.680]   United States these doctors they're just flushing the waste down the toilet
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:52.240]   Atlanta's news agencies have revealed that Ebola's patient waste including
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:56.160]   feces and urine are going into the city's public sewer system they say
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:58.560]   there's no risk of infection of the general public because their waste
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:03.640]   management practices will kill any viruses flushed into the system does
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.800]   that make you feel does that make you feel any safer what about my curse I
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:12.880]   can't imagine that they've had that much experience in flushing Ebola out of the
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:17.280]   waste system up it sounds like it would be unprecedented so I wouldn't have
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.320]   complete confidence in that but even just the fact of bringing these infected
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.280]   doctors into America I mean dr. Bob Arnaud who is an infectious disease
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:30.120]   specialist said quote there is no medical reason to bring them here
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.720]   especially when you see how well dr. Bradley was because they had the same
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:38.640]   drug the exact same drug over in Africa so why was there even a need to put
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.960]   anybody at risk by bringing them into Atlanta some of the speculation was
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:50.240]   centered around the fact that the CDC had a patent on a strain of Ebola and a
[00:25:50.240 --> 00:25:53.760]   vaccine already ready for it so that was why they were bringing them into the
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:58.080]   country I'm not sure about that but even the top infectious disease specialists
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:26:01.520]   have questioned why they need to bring them into America in the first place
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.840]   when you can treat them with the exact same drug in Africa remember SARS
[00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:11.520]   patients were brought into Canada from Asia in 2003 and they ended up
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:17.000]   infecting 400 people and killing 44 people as a result because they brought
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.960]   them into the country when it wasn't necessary so it really doesn't make a
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:27.600]   lot of sense and if you don't if you don't believe Paul that the CDC has an
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:32.600]   actual patent on Ebola there's a global research article from August 6 that I'm
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:36.840]   bringing up on my computer over here you guys can pull up a weapon of mass
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:42.900]   destruction and that might not even be the article this article is why it's a
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.920]   different article actually from August 3rd and why do the US Centers for
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:51.320]   Disease Control only patent on Ebola and it's called Ebola bun and I'm gonna give
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:58.800]   you the patent number you don't believe me it's CA 2741523A1 there's the patent
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:05.920]   number right there and it was awarded in 2010 there you go very interesting so
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:08.880]   they they own the CDC owns the patent on it maybe they want to see if this was
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:14.200]   their strain of Ebola that's out there and another thing people aren't aren't
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:18.480]   don't seem to be too concerned about it if they decide to crack down and and
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:27.560]   round people up and do this with you know grabbing it's like this when I was
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:33.000]   in Chicago we were accompanying the National Guard who were doing hazmat
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.200]   recovery rescue operations for a biological pandemic that had happened
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:43.200]   they were also going after gun owners that which they were calling terrorists
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:47.640]   but they were going after these people and one of the exercises they had was
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.240]   taking place at a sports stadium and there are sports stadiums all over the
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:54.840]   country you got high school you got college you got professional you plenty
[00:27:54.840 --> 00:27:58.880]   of sports stadiums in this country and they were going to use these stations as
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:02.920]   staging grounds a and also places to round people up which we saw in Katrina
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:06.840]   with New Orleans so this is not unprecedented these are all over the
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:11.320]   place and anytime they want to pull the trigger and say hey come here if you
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:14.760]   want to get your vaccine bring it on in come on in we got a place for you to
[00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.880]   stay but then you're never gonna get out they didn't let those people out of the
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:24.640]   Superdome for almost a week and that's where this stuff could go if it does get
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:27.640]   loose in the United States which begs the question why are we bringing these
[00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:31.560]   people in why not keep them offshore why not build a medical boat if you want to
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:35.240]   treat these people why not do that a lot of questions going on with this we're
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:38.440]   gonna finish up with this in the next segment we're also gonna start taking

[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:07.520]   one of which they just got back from New York during the 13th anniversary of 9/11
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:11.360]   you guys can punch this up here I want to show you two videos here on the Alex
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:16.240]   Jones channel this is something that I spend a lot of my time on youtube.com
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:19.520]   forward slash the Alex Jones channel we got two videos right now that are going
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:24.200]   viral one is from the nightly news on Friday and this is Darren McBreen's
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:28.080]   piece shocking demonic photos of Obama and it shows him literally with devil
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:33.640]   horns really scary and if you think that this is oh well he just happened to be
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:38.280]   set up that way they pay people hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:42.440]   stuff like this doesn't occur and they pay people hundreds of thousands of
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:44.800]   dollars to make sure stuff like this does occur so let me tell you that's a
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:49.600]   message right there there's your demonic president and the other one is 9/11
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:55.000]   fire firefighter blows WTC7 cover-up wide open that's an interview that Leon
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.680]   McAdoo did with firefighter Rudy Dent who was off that day of 9/11 but after
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:05.960]   the towers collapsed he raced over to his fire station him and his boys
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.760]   commandeered a mail truck and went in there to help rescue people and he
[00:35:09.760 --> 00:35:15.800]   actually saw explosions happening at WTC7 he saw molten metal things that he
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:20.720]   cannot explain as a firefighter and one of which is how the building collapsed
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:25.480]   this this doesn't happen regularly in fact the only time it's happened because
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:32.880]   of a fire is in during 9/11 so you don't have to don't beat me up about it go look
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.960]   at building structural integrity go look at office building fires that have
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.160]   happened there was a fire in Shanghai China a few years ago that burned for
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:43.680]   over 24 hours and did not collapse into its own footprint so that stuff just
[00:35:43.680 --> 00:35:48.560]   doesn't magically happen it has to be planned so that that's an amazing
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:52.800]   interview with with Rudy Dent you can see that 9/11 firefighter blows WTC7
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:57.440]   cover-up wide open and we've got a few few things on there a few of our little
[00:35:57.440 --> 00:36:03.520]   playlist you see Joe Biggs crossing the Rio Grande in El Paso our adventures in
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:10.200]   Ferguson lots of stuff up there on the Alex Jones channel on YouTube but one
[00:36:10.200 --> 00:36:15.120]   way you can support us is by becoming a member of prison planet TV which we have
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:19.680]   all the same stuff that you see on the Alex Jones channel but you can download
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:25.640]   it you can spread it around we've got the day show the nightly news our
[00:36:25.640 --> 00:36:31.960]   special reports we have some movies up there so we Alex has made Oh dozens of
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.200]   documentaries I helped make a couple of them one of which is police day for the
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:40.760]   rise of FEMA which I was a co-director on back in we released that in 2010 and
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:45.720]   just an amazing wealth of information that you can access for just pennies a
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:50.860]   day and you can use your username and password and share it with up to 11
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:55.560]   people you have 11 of you on right now watching the show watching the videos as
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:58.800]   we pull them up did you see the video that we showed from the Nova
[00:36:58.800 --> 00:37:04.200]   presentation where they're talking about how this Ebola went airborne from
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:10.400]   through the ventilation shaft okay this stuff is happening right now no one can
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:14.520]   explain how it's spreading no one can explain how these doctors are getting
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.080]   sick when these doctors go in there they're wearing hazmat suits they're
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:21.680]   spraying themselves down with Lysol and chlorine there's no reason for this
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:26.440]   many doctors we get sick we just had our fourth doctor die in Sierra Leone and
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:30.120]   we've got four doctors here to which have seemed to have recovered and two
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.760]   which are still sick one in Atlanta and the other in Nebraska so we've just
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:38.800]   brought it to the middle of the country why not and they're flushing it all down
[00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:44.040]   the toilet all the waste is going down the toilet so I guess they think they've
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:48.560]   got it under control Paul Watson let's finish up on Ebola and I want to play
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:51.440]   that clip again from the Nova presentation in case people missed it
[00:37:51.440 --> 00:37:54.440]   because we did play it earlier in the show and I think people need to hear
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:59.760]   this that they've known since 1989 that this thing can go airborne so how would
[00:37:59.760 --> 00:38:04.520]   you like to finish this up yeah I just want to mention I wrote a story on
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:08.260]   Friday about this German expert from the Institute of Tropical Medicine in
[00:38:08.260 --> 00:38:11.880]   Hamburg he basically gave some statements to Deutsch Well which is a
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:16.320]   major German publication he said that the Ebola virus in Sierra Leone and
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.360]   Liberia would only burn itself out when it's infected the entire population of
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.360]   those two countries and killed five million people and he basically said
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:29.720]   that all hope is lost for those two countries and that it's too late what's
[00:38:29.720 --> 00:38:34.760]   weird about it is literally within an hour of me publishing that report on
[00:38:34.760 --> 00:38:39.680]   InfoWars and giving it a headline worthy of the quotes that were actually in the
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:44.120]   article about five million people dying they changed not only the headline of
[00:38:44.120 --> 00:38:48.880]   the article but they removed the quotes from the article from this expert saying
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:53.920]   that five million people would die in Africa as a result of Ebola so it and
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.440]   there was no formal retraction that's the thing if you change a news article
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.600]   after the fact in such a major way you know this wasn't a spelling error or
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:07.080]   something it was a major retraction it was a change of the headline removing
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.020]   quotes that's right you don't only have to announce it you put a note saying hey
[00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:13.060]   we made a mistake he didn't actually say five million he said two hundred
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:17.280]   thousand which they didn't know that as a retraction they just left it they just
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:23.280]   removed it it was a I guess a piece of 1984 jargon and and what's interesting
[00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:29.000]   is that they say this thing's gonna double in about two weeks so they say
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:34.360]   20,000 people could be affected here by Friday but then that's gonna double and
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:39.460]   this thing just keeps going on and on and on and they have no way to really
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:45.600]   stop it there's no supposed vaccine if there will ever be a real vaccine if it
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:49.440]   doesn't help spread it I find it interesting too that as soon and I was
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.280]   watching this months ago when it first started happening the the villagers that
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:57.480]   they were treating were attacking these medical centers they were saying the
[00:39:57.480 --> 00:40:00.720]   doctors were helping spread this they were accusing them of it now I don't
[00:40:00.720 --> 00:40:05.080]   know if they were or if it was just this this case of them being superstitious
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:08.680]   but I find that very interesting that the villagers were freaking out that
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:11.560]   these health workers were here and that the virus just kept getting worse and
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:16.440]   worse now it could be a coincidence it could be but I don't know what do you
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:21.560]   think about that Paul I don't know Rob it's bizarre there's also a story about
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:26.840]   a black market treatment for Ebola which is now circulating in Africa which the
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:31.280]   WHO and the other health authorities are trying to clamp down on and eliminate so
[00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:35.560]   there's obviously a lot of concern from people in Africa that if there is a
[00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:38.920]   treatment for this which we know they've been working on it that they're not
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:43.000]   getting proper access to it so now they're having to go to the black market
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.960]   to try and get something which I don't know it may or may not work but the WHO
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:51.160]   is keen to clamp down on it so there's a lot of bizarre things going on behind
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.560]   the scenes and again with the media aspect there's a lot of massaging of the
[00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:59.760]   message I mean we know the CDC has been very reluctant to release any information
[00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:04.240]   on suspected Ebola sufferers in the United States and obviously that's the
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:08.520]   same in Germany and across the board also I wanted to mention the the
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:13.920]   advisory that the CDC put out to the airline staff to provide surgical masks
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:17.880]   to potential Ebola victims in order to quote reduce the number of droplets
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:23.320]   expelled into the air by talking sneezing or coughing not use compressed
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:27.520]   air which might spread infectious material through the air so at least to
[00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:31.200]   some extent they're also concerned about it spreading through the air and this
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:35.600]   was an advisory that was put out months ago and is still in effect so again it
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:39.200]   goes back to the speculation of whether it's gone airborne and that it's not
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.320]   just contractible via exchange of bodily fluids and we've got the video clip from
[00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:49.760]   the Nova program in the 90s talking about an 89 secret errat monkey
[00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:52.240]   eradication program that the United States government underwent let's go to
[00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:58.800]   that clip real quick in 1989 Ebola made its way to the US residents of this
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:42:03.800]   Washington DC suburb had no idea that one of the world's deadliest viruses had
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.080]   emerged in their midst
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:17.000]   in a primate quarantine unit in Reston Virginia monkeys and one of the holding
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:23.800]   rooms suddenly began to die secretly a military team entered the quarantine
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:29.360]   unit and killed all 60 monkeys in the infected room
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:43.720]   the crisis heightened as monkeys began to die in a different room it appeared
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:49.200]   that the virus was moving through the ventilating system in response the
[00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:56.360]   military killed all 400 monkeys there you go the military was involved in
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:43:00.040]   covering up a airborne transmission of Ebola we'll be right back you heard

[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:44.960]   government to get you on Obamacare and take away your guns doesn't surprise me
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.880]   now we might even get into some chemtrail news there was an interesting
[00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:55.800]   article that came out in CBS it was on Drudge Report about a mysterious streak
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:59.840]   of light in the Bay Area that morning people were talking about it and it
[00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:04.440]   reminded me of an article we posted on Friday and we'll get all we'll get to
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:11.080]   that all coming up in the next hour Paul we've got some interesting stuff going
[00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:18.720]   on with ISIS a few days ago the entire ISIS opposition was blown up in an
[00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:26.000]   explosion how convenient they were all sent to Mustafar and Anakin Skywalker
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.560]   came in with a lightsaber and just started slicing and dicing and then I
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.400]   guess blew up the station I mean at least that's how it happened in Star
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:37.240]   Wars episode 3 what do you make of that the entire leadership is just decimated
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:41.080]   with a bomb we got the footage running right now if you're watching on prison
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:45.520]   planet TV of Anakin about to take care of the guys who were supposed to be on
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:49.840]   his side yeah there he is taking care of him
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:55.920]   what do you make of all this I mean that was a really bizarre story I know these
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:49:59.640]   rebel groups like to blow each other up on a regular basis now there's a lot of
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:04.120]   infighting but it was quite bizarre that this mystery explosion just wiped out
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:09.440]   all of them there's also a really interesting article on ISIS called path
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:13.680]   to war then and now haunt Obama which is a New York Times article the top of
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:17.400]   drudge at the moment and there are several interesting quotes including
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:21.000]   about these beheading videos which we can move on to a little bit later but in
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.420]   terms of ISIS in the strike and on Syria which we saw introduced last week in
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:30.360]   Obama's speech or earlier this week it's now come to light that before he gave
[00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:36.760]   that speech on Wednesday night Obama met with basically the CFR and the big new
[00:50:36.760 --> 00:50:41.600]   Brzezinski now remember Hillary Clinton admitted that the CFR was located just
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:44.760]   down the street from the State Department because it gives the State
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:49.800]   Department its orders it runs US foreign policy so hours before Obama gave this
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:54.640]   big speech on ISIS and how he's planning to conduct airstrikes in Syria which of
[00:50:54.640 --> 00:50:59.040]   course he failed to do last year he's meeting with the CFR and he's also
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:05.640]   meeting with groups of columnists and magazine writers for a quote discussion
[00:51:05.640 --> 00:51:10.560]   hours before he gives this major speech he's meeting with all these editorial
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:14.600]   writers media heads from the New York Times Washington Post and it's
[00:51:14.600 --> 00:51:19.800]   obviously to massage the message on ISIS we saw this with Bush numerous times
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:24.160]   before he gave major foreign policy speeches he would meet with the New York
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:28.280]   Times and the Washington Post hours beforehand to basically instruct them
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:32.760]   on how to craft the narrative craft what he's trying to push the propaganda he's
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:38.320]   trying to manifest and project onto the American people and that's state media I
[00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:43.160]   mean it's a glaring example of how they basically get their marching orders to
[00:51:43.160 --> 00:51:46.800]   create the narrative that the White House wants and then they put it out
[00:51:46.800 --> 00:51:50.280]   immediately after Obama's speech and Paul we did not get invited to this
[00:51:50.280 --> 00:51:55.200]   press conference that's how I can say it's state-run media because the meat
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:58.040]   not all the media were asked to come to this I could tell you that right now
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:52:03.520]   InfoWars was not asked to come and give and sit and take notes and be given fact
[00:52:03.520 --> 00:52:07.960]   sheets of the talking points I'm gonna go back to some back in right before
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:11.320]   September 11th remember they killed the commander of the Northern Alliance with
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:14.440]   the bomb they had some guys that were gonna come interview him and they killed
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:19.080]   him right before 9/11 happened and all this invasion so maybe that is this is a
[00:52:19.080 --> 00:52:24.880]   precursor to another invasion of Syria maybe that's what this means so you know
[00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:28.280]   they go in and kill these supposed opposition leaders to bring in a whole
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.440]   new crop of people that we don't know anything about I don't know much about
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.920]   these Syrian opposition guys anyway but now we have a whole new crowd of people
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:38.840]   we know nothing about who could be involved in that and who could pull
[00:52:38.840 --> 00:52:43.000]   something off like that what kind of an operation makes you wonder well I mean
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.960]   they're arming the Syrian opposition who are openly defecting and giving weapons
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:52.600]   to Isis I mean I documented that last week in an article so the announcement
[00:52:52.600 --> 00:52:56.840]   for Obama to send all this aid and weapons to these Syrian rebels are
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:53:02.120]   basically fighting Isis by arming Isis because now as I documented in that
[00:53:02.120 --> 00:53:06.800]   article they're defecting to Isis giving them weapons in fact that beheaded
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:12.280]   journalist Stephen Sokloff was sold to Isis by the so-called moderate rebels so
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:17.280]   now we're backing the allies of Isis as the US's allies in the region Saudi
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:21.960]   Arabia Qatar Turkey and Jordan funded bankroll trained Isis militants in the
[00:53:21.960 --> 00:53:27.000]   first place but going back to this New York Times article a quote Obama
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.080]   contemplated the possibility that mr. Assad might order his forces to fire at
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:36.000]   American planes entering Syrian airspace if he dared to do that you know if he
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.360]   dared to defend his own country quote mr. Obama said he would order American
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:44.520]   forces to wipe out Syria's air defense system which he noted would be easier
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:48.960]   than striking Isis because its locations are better known he went on to say that
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:54.040]   such an action by mr. Assad would lead to his overthrow so Obama is now saying
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:58.440]   in private and this has been leaked since that if Syria dares to defend its
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:04.320]   own sovereign airspace against American bombardment under the justification of
[00:54:04.320 --> 00:54:10.280]   targeting Isis that basically Obama will launch a full-scale war on Syria so it
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:14.680]   reminds us of the the plot back during just before the Iraq invasion where they
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:21.040]   plan to fly a u-2 spy plane over Iraq painted in UN colors and try to provoke
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:25.600]   Saddam Hussein into into ordering it being shot down to create the pretext
[00:54:25.600 --> 00:54:29.080]   for a justified attack so now we're seeing exactly the same script being
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:33.600]   repeated in Syria yeah I think Dick Cheney came up with that plan with the
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:37.520]   you with the u-2 spy plane I mean these people will not stop they have to have
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:41.680]   their clone droid armies fighting against each other and we have to pay
[00:54:41.680 --> 00:54:46.160]   for it and this is just it's it's the same story over and over again ten years
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.440]   later we're still at the same spot we're about to go to war with an enemy that we
[00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:53.600]   cannot beat that has no base of operations that can strike us at any
[00:54:53.600 --> 00:54:58.320]   time and there might even be reports of these guys coming over the border we
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:05.120]   don't know we we just don't know what is gonna happen and they've got it they're
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:10.040]   arming these guys they've got it so well orchestrated and now we have senators
[00:55:10.040 --> 00:55:16.920]   like Patrick Leahy coming out and saying if we go against NSA well if we curb the
[00:55:16.920 --> 00:55:22.480]   NSA it could help Isis that's from the hill that just came out I mean they
[00:55:22.480 --> 00:55:26.240]   won't stop it's it's we have to just keep ramping up and taking away your
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.960]   rights which last week a guy we've had on this show and I agree with a lot of
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:35.120]   what he says Nigel Farage one of your fellow countrymen came out and said we
[00:55:35.120 --> 00:55:40.480]   have to give up liberty for security and we have that video clip and you guys
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:45.360]   roll that or if you don't have it
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:50.400]   I genuinely believe that if citizens of our countries have been to Syria or Iraq
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:56.920]   to fight for Isis or any similar organization we would be mad literally
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:02.560]   mad to allow them back into our country so I can't turn the clock back you know
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:07.920]   I tried ten years ago to stop this from happening and I was shouted down but
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:13.120]   what we can do is to make sure that it doesn't get worse and I'm afraid within
[00:56:13.120 --> 00:56:18.240]   our own states we're gonna have to be very very vigilant indeed and that
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:23.040]   probably means and I'm sad to say this but it probably means giving up some of
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:26.920]   the liberties that previously we've enjoyed well my previous comment to you
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:31.760]   there was that I thought we would have to surrender some of the previous
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:37.000]   liberties and freedoms that we enjoyed in order to deal with something that is
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:43.200]   a crisis that does actually and let's be serious this faces the very existence of
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:47.480]   our civilization you know there are people out there no sorry there are
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:52.800]   people within here that want to destroy us and their main means of
[00:56:52.800 --> 00:56:59.880]   communication is social media and I'm afraid that the state and the services
[00:56:59.880 --> 00:57:04.680]   and the authorities that are paid and empowered to protect us are going to
[00:57:04.680 --> 00:57:08.880]   have to have more powers to deal with to deal with these people and they will do
[00:57:08.880 --> 00:57:14.560]   it via social media and I hate to say this because seems to me that you know
[00:57:14.560 --> 00:57:18.360]   if I ring you on a Sunday night and so talk about the football game or whatever
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:23.400]   it may be or we email each other to talk about mutual friends I would rather live
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:28.040]   in a world where that was free and private and we had our liberty I'm afraid
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:37.880]   but but but I'm afraid that we're now in territory that is so so serious and I
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:43.640]   say this not willing for this to happen but let's just remember that Isis have
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:48.000]   said they will launch terrorist
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:53.280]   after consulting top doctors nutritionist pharmacist and others we

[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:32.840]   Ebola and the military response that was one thing we didn't cover the DOD is
[01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:35.920]   gonna be tasked they're making that their number one priority I've got Paul
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:40.080]   Joseph Watson with me writing shotgun I'm actually looking for that article
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:44.840]   right now it was a Fox News article that we had and we're gonna finish up on ISIS
[01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:49.200]   we got a five-minute segment here and then we're gonna come back from this
[01:00:49.200 --> 01:00:53.520]   break I promise we're gonna go right to Bowser in Missouri we got Jim and Callie
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:58.680]   Roy in Montana Jim in Tennessee and Rashid in Philadelphia you guys are all
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.720]   very concerned about Ebola and that's good this is something we should be
[01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:04.360]   concerned about especially now that we're importing it into our country the
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:09.480]   State Department's getting over 160,000 hazmat uniforms that's the State
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:14.320]   Department not even the CDC I mean what does this all mean this is crazy
[01:01:14.320 --> 01:01:20.440]   Paul let's get back to ISIS let's let's finish up on this we've got senators we
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:24.080]   just finished up with that clip from Nigel Farage talking about how we have
[01:01:24.080 --> 01:01:28.920]   to he's channeling bizarro Ben Franklin we have to give up our liberties for
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:31.960]   security we have to give up our liberties for security I mean and this
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:34.320]   is coming from everywhere even the Huffington Post is saying we got to
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.360]   raise taxes and bring back the draft to fight ISIS I mean this is a group we
[01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:42.600]   funded why don't we just cut their funding well the the potency of this
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.520]   propaganda is seemingly so intense that it's fooled people on both the left and
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:51.680]   right that you would normally assume would be guarded against this kind of
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:56.680]   militaristic bellicose you know talking point because I mean you know with
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:02:02.680]   Farage the NSA bulk collection of data from telephone calls did not foil a
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:05.800]   single terrorist plot I mean that's documented there's a there's a
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:10.000]   Washington blog article about that which goes through the the justifications and
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:14.480]   then the debunking that it never stopped a single terrorist plot so it's a false
[01:02:14.480 --> 01:02:20.040]   paradigm in the first place I think Farage Farage's logic is absent the fact
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.200]   that many of the terror plots in the United States and indeed in Britain
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:28.120]   where most of the radical Islamic preachers are actually you know mi5
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:32.720]   informants if you actually dig into it same in the United States with the FBI
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:37.320]   being behind most domestic terror plots they create the patsies they provide
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.520]   them with the fake explosives in the first place they radicalize all the
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:45.720]   members of the terrorist cells you know his argument is absent that foundational
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:49.880]   logic they find people of dubious mental clarity I mean most of these guys have
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:55.640]   very low IQs there was one case it was a group of guys in a house and I think it
[01:02:55.640 --> 01:02:59.400]   was Ohio they were gonna blow up a bridge and then the landlord was the guy
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:03.080]   who was the informant and he was getting these guys riled up every day and then
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:06.600]   like hey I got the bomb I got the bomb let's go do it I mean it's total it's
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.680]   insanity what the FBI does now and this is just to keep their budgets going this
[01:03:10.680 --> 01:03:14.640]   is just to keep the war on terror going it's like it's like why they ship drugs
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:17.600]   into this country to keep the war on drugs going we got to ship in the drugs
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:22.480]   and feed them to people it's insane I mean even the New York Times there was
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:26.080]   a quite a famous article a couple years ago where they it was something like FBI
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:31.520]   plots created by the terror plots created by the FBI and basically every
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:36.360]   single major domestic terror plot has been a result of the FBI radicalizing
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:39.880]   these mentally disturbed patsies providing them with the fake explosives
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:43.960]   generating contriving the plot themselves and I think Farage is playing
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:48.440]   off this idea that Cameron and Obama have been quote weak on ISIS but again
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:53.560]   it's absent the knowledge that the US trained many ISIS militants in Jordan in
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:58.680]   2012 of course many Syrian rebels backed by the UK and the US defected to ISIS
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:03.160]   became part of the radicalized group so they're trying as UKIP becomes more
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:07.280]   closer to the mainstream as they try to accrue more power they're taking on more
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.440]   establishment talking points which is concerning I mean I voted for them in
[01:04:11.440 --> 01:04:15.480]   the recent European elections because they offered a genuine alternative but
[01:04:15.480 --> 01:04:20.520]   any any so-called self-proclaimed libertarian that says we need to give up
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:24.600]   our freedom for security needs to take a serious look in the mirror because we're
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.120]   told that the terrorists hate us for our freedom yet we're gonna willingly give
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:32.600]   it up to so to in the name of fighting terrorism which in the main is created
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:38.040]   by our own government that's the great paradox that we live in now because of
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:44.200]   the terrorists that we arm and that we give training to and missiles and Benghazi
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:48.840]   and now we give them airliners strap yourselves in we're gonna be going to

[01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.920]   I've got riding shotgun with me Paul Watson over in England
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:43.920]   We're talking about ISIS right now but first before we go any further
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:44.920]   We're going to go to your calls
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:47.920]   We got Bowser in Missouri
[01:07:47.920 --> 01:07:48.920]   Thanks for waiting
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:50.920]   What's your question Bowser?
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.920]   Yes, good talk to you InfoWarriors
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:57.920]   Really enjoy Paul Watson's reports, he's great
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.920]   I called today, I'm an old guy, 61
[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:04.920]   I was a medic in the paratroops
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:06.920]   However my dad was a colonel
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:10.920]   He was an NBC warfare expert, a general staff officer
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:17.920]   I've been worried about biological breakouts since I was about 10 years old
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.920]   I just wanted to bring attention to your listeners
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:28.920]   A great book that truly brings home the horrors of the bio warfare scenario
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:32.920]   And that is a book called "The Demon in the Freezer"
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.920]   You can find it on Amazon
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:41.920]   And it covers the Marburg virus which is essentially the same thing as Ebola
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.920]   And smallpox, etc
[01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:52.920]   And it closes out the book with the last couple chapters on the monkey house in Reston, Virginia
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:58.920]   And I guarantee you, you'll have a week's worth of sleepless nights after you read that book
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:00.920]   That's all guys
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:02.920]   Well let me tell you, I couldn't sleep after watching that Nova clip
[01:09:02.920 --> 01:09:07.920]   Just how they knew back in 1989 that this disease could go airborne
[01:09:07.920 --> 01:09:11.920]   Back then they traced it going through the ventilation shaft
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.920]   Different areas of monkeys were getting infected
[01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:16.920]   They had to eradicate 400 monkeys
[01:09:16.920 --> 01:09:20.920]   And it was the US military going in there in secret doing this
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:22.920]   This never made the news
[01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:28.920]   And it becomes a footnote in a Nova presentation with a nice narrator talking it over like it's no big deal
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.920]   They eradicated the problem
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:32.920]   Yes, uh-huh
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:35.920]   Well, I mean, this is so frightening to me
[01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:39.920]   The fact that they're telling us that 20,000 people are infected
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:43.920]   My guess is it's probably closer to a quarter million by now
[01:09:43.920 --> 01:09:45.920]   And I mean that
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:48.920]   Oh no, they say this thing's going to double every two weeks
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:51.920]   So if you have 20,000 a few days ago
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:54.920]   You know, in a few days it's going to be 40
[01:09:54.920 --> 01:09:56.920]   And then it's going to be 80
[01:09:56.920 --> 01:09:57.920]   And then it's 160
[01:09:57.920 --> 01:09:59.920]   And that's just the ones they know about
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:00.920]   What about the ones they don't know about?
[01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:01.920]   What about the ones in the outlying areas?
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.920]   The people who are getting turned away
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:05.920]   Because people are getting turned away from clinics
[01:10:05.920 --> 01:10:06.920]   And they say every time one's getting turned away
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:11.920]   That's another one and a half cases that we know of that could just be infected
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:12.920]   So I mean, it's just crazy
[01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.920]   There is no response to this
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:16.920]   And they just don't want to admit that it's gone airborne
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:18.920]   So, do you have anything else to add, Bowser?
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:22.920]   Yes, it's also insane and unconscionable
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:26.920]   That they're actually flying these victims all over the world
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:28.920]   I mean, that's not what you do
[01:10:28.920 --> 01:10:30.920]   You pin them up
[01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:31.920]   You know, it sounds cruel
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:33.920]   But you pin them up and you let them die there
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:34.920]   That's what you do
[01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:39.920]   Or at least, take a ship out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:40.920]   And fly everybody there
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:41.920]   Put it in the Mediterranean
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:44.920]   Put it where nobody else is going to get infected
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:45.920]   And don't let anybody off the ship
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.920]   If you go on this ship, you sign an agreement
[01:10:47.920 --> 01:10:50.920]   Saying you're not going to leave for at least six months
[01:10:50.920 --> 01:10:53.920]   So we know, bona fide, that you're not infected
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:55.920]   And you're not going to infect anybody else
[01:10:55.920 --> 01:10:59.920]   Yeah, it's just unconscionable the way they're handling this
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:01.920]   And they're doing it, I think, on purpose
[01:11:01.920 --> 01:11:06.920]   I think it's all part of the global depopulation plan
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:07.920]   I really do, fellas
[01:11:07.920 --> 01:11:09.920]   Well, you know, Bill Gates is getting involved now
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:13.920]   And, you know, now GlaxoSmithKline wants to make a vaccine
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:16.920]   Well, if they make a vaccine, it ends up in the United States
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:19.920]   You've suddenly got 300 million people who want to buy this thing right off the bat
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:21.920]   And who actually have the money to buy it
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:24.920]   Unlike most of these African countries where it has to be aided in
[01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:25.920]   Thanks for your call, Bowser
[01:11:25.920 --> 01:11:27.920]   We're going to go now to Jim in Cali
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:30.920]   He wants to talk about Ebola and the military response
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:31.920]   I agree, Jim
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:36.920]   It doesn't make sense that the DOD is being enlisted to help eradicate Ebola
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.920]   Hi, yeah, thanks for taking my call
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:43.920]   On that subject, if you recall, a couple of years ago
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:47.920]   There was a drill, a public drill
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:51.920]   Between the US military and the CDC
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:54.920]   In which they went out and had people dressed up as zombies
[01:11:54.920 --> 01:11:59.920]   And they would shoot them in this staged emergency exercise
[01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:02.920]   And at the time, you know, it was covered all over the news
[01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:05.920]   And people were wondering, well, why are they training for zombies?
[01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:06.920]   This makes no sense, this is a fantasy
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:09.920]   Why are they being so serious about a zombie apocalypse
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:11.920]   And training to shoot down scores of infected people?
[01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:14.920]   Well, now when you look at what we're seeing with Ebola
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:15.920]   It makes perfect sense
[01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:18.920]   They needed some sort of fantastical cover
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:20.920]   For what could be a real scenario
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:24.920]   Where you have scores of infected people that they need to quarantine
[01:12:24.920 --> 01:12:26.920]   And at the end of the day, they'll do to us
[01:12:26.920 --> 01:12:29.920]   Like they did to those monkeys in Russia
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:30.920]   And just shoot us all down
[01:12:30.920 --> 01:12:32.920]   And it'll be a secret military mission
[01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.920]   Where they close off a city
[01:12:34.920 --> 01:12:36.920]   And come in and firebomb the place
[01:12:36.920 --> 01:12:39.920]   And then those who get out will be shot with guns
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.920]   I mean, you can see that in the movies
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.920]   And Ebola is a zombie-like virus
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:47.920]   I mean, it transmitted through blood, through biting
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.920]   It makes sense that they would be training to eradicate zombies
[01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:55.920]   Because that's what they think is coming down the pipe
[01:12:55.920 --> 01:12:57.920]   Of course, the CDC is involved in it
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:00.920]   But they'll have their experimental vaccine
[01:13:00.920 --> 01:13:02.920]   That's probably clean, not filled with mercury
[01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:04.920]   To help themselves out
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.920]   Yeah, I agree
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:08.920]   People have got to look into this stuff
[01:13:08.920 --> 01:13:10.920]   It's always stuff that happens two or three years ago
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:12.920]   That's now coming back into the news
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.920]   You got anything else to add, Jim?
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:17.920]   Yeah, speaking of the vaccines
[01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.920]   I just got a chance to watch World War Z
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:22.920]   And one thing that caught my attention
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:26.920]   Was that their solution for the zombie virus
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:32.920]   Was to inject everybody with another deadly virus
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:34.920]   Yeah, and they don't talk about what happens after that
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:37.920]   Yes, exactly
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.920]   But that was the hope of mankind
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.920]   Was to basically inject yourself with another deadly virus
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.920]   So hopefully that's not predictive programming
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:45.920]   But you know how Hollywood is these days
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.920]   Well, in Book 2, apparently
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:49.920]   Or I think in the next movie, if they do make it
[01:13:49.920 --> 01:13:51.920]   Apparently they come after gun owners next
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:53.920]   And that's the big fight
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.920]   Is in the US with the patriots
[01:13:55.920 --> 01:13:57.920]   Who have their guns still
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:13:59.920]   And don't want to give them up
[01:13:59.920 --> 01:14:01.920]   So that's where that is going
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.920]   Thanks for the call, Jim
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.920]   We go now to Roy in Montana
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.920]   Roy, how's it going?
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:09.920]   Good, thanks for taking my call
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:11.920]   I really appreciate getting to talk to you
[01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.920]   And Paul, I really respect you guys
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.920]   Yeah, what's your question?
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:17.920]   Well, I don't actually have a question
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.920]   My son was in the Army
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:21.920]   And he was in a platoon over in Afghanistan
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:23.920]   Came back and then he has to do a stint
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.920]   In the National Guard
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.920]   For a year and a half or two years
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.920]   And they just got done with their big training
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:31.920]   Down in Idaho
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:33.920]   And there was a two-star general
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:35.920]   And two guys there from the Pentagon
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:37.920]   And each of them was given a survey
[01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.920]   And the survey said
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:41.920]   Are you willing to confiscate weapons from civilians?
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:43.920]   And if ordered to, will you fire on American citizens?
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.920]   And, uh, you know
[01:14:45.920 --> 01:14:47.920]   He said they were outraged
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:49.920]   And the general told him
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:51.920]   That the Pentagon guys said
[01:14:51.920 --> 01:14:53.920]   They were gearing up for something in 2016
[01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:55.920]   But they wouldn't tell him what
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:57.920]   And told him a couple of other things on the side
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:59.920]   And, uh, so I thought you guys would be interested in that
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:01.920]   That's very interesting
[01:15:01.920 --> 01:15:03.920]   Is that online anywhere?
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.920]   Or is that just, this is just a story from your son?
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:07.920]   Well, no, that's just a story from my son
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.920]   And the guys that, you know
[01:15:09.920 --> 01:15:11.920]   They had to go over there
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:13.920]   So, um, the guys from his platoon
[01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.920]   That came back with him
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:17.920]   And, uh, they were outraged
[01:15:17.920 --> 01:15:19.920]   He's trying to get a copy from somebody
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:21.920]   You know, so we can send it to you guys
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.920]   Yeah, a copy or even a shot on a cell phone
[01:15:23.920 --> 01:15:25.920]   Anything like that
[01:15:25.920 --> 01:15:27.920]   Anytime something like that pops up
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.920]   You need to immediately shoot that on your smartphone
[01:15:29.920 --> 01:15:31.920]   And send it to tips@infowars.com
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.920]   Or whistleblower@infowars.com
[01:15:33.920 --> 01:15:35.920]   And I comb through those regularly
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:37.920]   And I love to receive the tips
[01:15:37.920 --> 01:15:39.920]   I mean, I've received some outrageous stuff
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.920]   Some stuff that we haven't even gone public with yet
[01:15:41.920 --> 01:15:43.920]   Because we have to vet it first
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:45.920]   Because it's so outrageous
[01:15:45.920 --> 01:15:47.920]   But, uh, Roy, thanks for the call
[01:15:47.920 --> 01:15:49.920]   We're going to be back right after this
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.920]   With more of your questions
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:53.920]   It's the Alex Jones Show and I'm your host Rob Doux

[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:03.920]   In the development of a synergistic formulation
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:05.920]   Based around the key concepts
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:07.920]   Of super oxygenation
[01:16:07.920 --> 01:16:09.920]   The next level in cleansing is here
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:11.920]   With key ingredients backed by real clinical studies

[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.920]   Was invented during Dr. Group's research
[01:16:17.920 --> 01:16:19.920]   On the toxification of our bodies
[01:16:19.920 --> 01:16:21.920]   Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body
[01:16:21.920 --> 01:16:23.920]   And contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients
[01:16:23.920 --> 01:16:25.920]   Oftentimes full of synthetic fillers
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.920]   GMOs

[01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:37.920]   And there's no need for bad tasting concoctions
[01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:39.920]   Instead
[01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.920]   Oxy-Powder slowly releases
[01:16:41.920 --> 01:16:43.920]   Monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:45.920]   And body

[01:17:59.920 --> 01:18:01.920]   Where everybody in the entire city
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.920]   Has been told not to drink the water
[01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.920]   Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:07.920]   Did you know that the average person
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:09.920]   Uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:11.920]   At home every single day
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:13.920]   If there's a water emergency

[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.920]   Rashid, Philadelphia
[01:20:47.920 --> 01:20:49.920]   What is your question sir?
[01:20:49.920 --> 01:20:51.920]   I don't really have a question
[01:20:51.920 --> 01:20:53.920]   I just wanted to make sure
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:20:55.920]   I don't really have a question
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:57.920]   I just wanted to mention something that I
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:20:59.920]   I don't know
[01:20:59.920 --> 01:21:01.920]   It seemed interesting
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:03.920]   last month
[01:21:03.920 --> 01:21:05.920]   Now speak right into your phone please
[01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:07.920]   The first week of August
[01:21:07.920 --> 01:21:09.920]   I watched
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.920]   Twelve Monkeys
[01:21:11.920 --> 01:21:13.920]   for the first time
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.920]   And that seemed kind of interesting
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:17.920]   That the whole Ebola thing
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:19.920]   was being hyped
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:21.920]   That that
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:23.920]   at that same time
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:25.920]   So
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.920]   I don't know
[01:21:27.920 --> 01:21:29.920]   You don't think it was your watching of Twelve Monkeys that caused it?
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:31.920]   I don't know
[01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.920]   No I doubt it
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.920]   That was a weird coincidence
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.920]   Well you know Twelve Monkeys does have
[01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:39.920]   a lot of interesting stuff
[01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.920]   And what's interesting as well is I watched that movie
[01:21:41.920 --> 01:21:43.920]   just recently this year
[01:21:43.920 --> 01:21:45.920]   And we started making a promo on it
[01:21:45.920 --> 01:21:47.920]   And we kind of got put on the back burner
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.920]   And I'm gonna pull it back out this week and finish it up
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.920]   But yeah there was a disease out there
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:53.920]   And people thought it was having to do with these
[01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:55.920]   The army of the Twelve Monkeys
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:57.920]   And it ended up just being a crazy person who actually worked
[01:21:57.920 --> 01:21:59.920]   in a lab, a bio lab
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:01.920]   Went around infecting
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:03.920]   the world
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.920]   And so they had to send a guy, Bruce Willis back in the past
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:07.920]   to help
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:09.920]   find out how it spread
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:11.920]   That was their big thing
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:13.920]   Paul do you have any comment on the movie Twelve Monkeys
[01:22:13.920 --> 01:22:15.920]   and how it relates to Ebola?
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.920]   That's one that I've never seen actually Rob
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.920]   I always intended to see that one but never got around to it
[01:22:19.920 --> 01:22:21.920]   On the previous call
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.920]   this army drill with the CDC
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:25.920]   targeting quote
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.920]   zombies, that was based
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:29.920]   around an epidemic
[01:22:29.920 --> 01:22:31.920]   I mean the quote from the article was "Trainees will have to
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.920]   respond to medical emergencies
[01:22:33.920 --> 01:22:35.920]   while being harassed by zombies"
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.920]   So this zombie thing
[01:22:37.920 --> 01:22:39.920]   they used it as a cover to get people interested
[01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.920]   but it was actually all based around
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.920]   a pandemic scenario
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.920]   where they would have to deal with huge numbers of people
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:47.920]   so very
[01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:49.920]   concerning indeed and then
[01:22:49.920 --> 01:22:51.920]   again on the caller after that
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.920]   in fact Jim Garrow who we had on as a guest
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:55.920]   quite recently
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:22:57.920]   he exposed another one of these surveys
[01:22:57.920 --> 01:22:59.920]   where the army are asked if they will be willing to
[01:22:59.920 --> 01:23:01.920]   fire on Americans and those surveys have been
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:03.920]   taking place for at least two decades
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:05.920]   we've reported on them numerous times
[01:23:05.920 --> 01:23:07.920]   and he actually had a gun
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.920]   an illegal gun planted at his home
[01:23:09.920 --> 01:23:11.920]   in Canada, went to prison
[01:23:11.920 --> 01:23:13.920]   for a while for it so he claims he was
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:15.920]   targeted for releasing that
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.920]   information that an
[01:23:17.920 --> 01:23:19.920]   army, a service member in the army
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.920]   told him that they had been given a survey
[01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.920]   questioning whether they would fire
[01:23:23.920 --> 01:23:25.920]   on Americans so this is something that keeps
[01:23:25.920 --> 01:23:27.920]   on cropping up again and again and has done
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.920]   for at least two decades or more
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:35.920]   So Paul maybe it does
[01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:37.920]   make sense that the DOD is getting involved in Ebola
[01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.920]   maybe they are going to be part of this
[01:23:39.920 --> 01:23:41.920]   eradication program where they cordon off
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:43.920]   areas and when people try to get out
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:45.920]   they are just going to mow them down with
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:47.920]   machine gun fire so maybe that does make sense
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:49.920]   even though people are saying it doesn't make sense
[01:23:49.920 --> 01:23:51.920]   over on Fox News, it's Lucas Tomlinson
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.920]   who wrote that
[01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.920]   General Martin Dempsey said the Department of Defense
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:57.920]   number one priority is combating
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.920]   Ebola, right there, combating
[01:23:59.920 --> 01:24:01.920]   Ebola, so maybe it does
[01:24:01.920 --> 01:24:03.920]   make sense that they are having these and by
[01:24:03.920 --> 01:24:05.920]   2016
[01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:07.920]   we just had a caller, his son was getting training
[01:24:07.920 --> 01:24:09.920]   in Idaho
[01:24:09.920 --> 01:24:11.920]   and there was Pentagon reps there and a two star
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.920]   general and he was asking people
[01:24:13.920 --> 01:24:15.920]   would you confiscate guns from
[01:24:15.920 --> 01:24:17.920]   Americans or would you fire on Americans
[01:24:17.920 --> 01:24:19.920]   and some of
[01:24:19.920 --> 01:24:21.920]   these guys will do this, I don't think
[01:24:21.920 --> 01:24:23.920]   a lot of them will, I think they are going to be very
[01:24:23.920 --> 01:24:25.920]   surprised at the response they get from our military
[01:24:25.920 --> 01:24:27.920]   but you know, I mean you can see
[01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.920]   what happens in any of these situations, Ferguson
[01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:31.920]   the cops start firing on people
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:33.920]   firing tear gas on people, nobody steps up and says
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:35.920]   wait a minute, should we be doing this?
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.920]   These people are unarmed
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:39.920]   maybe we should just go after the people
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:41.920]   who are looting, the people who are causing the trouble
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:43.920]   identify those people and go in and get them
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:45.920]   if you are a protester, you are not going to
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.920]   go attack the police
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:49.920]   until they start attacking you
[01:24:49.920 --> 01:24:51.920]   or if you are infected with some sort of weird
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:53.920]   pandemic, what are your thoughts on that Paul?
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:24:57.920]   The fact that they are merely asking the question
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:24:59.920]   will you fire on Americans is concerning
[01:24:59.920 --> 01:25:01.920]   enough, then of course you have got the report
[01:25:01.920 --> 01:25:03.920]   which recently came out where
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:05.920]   the army is saying they are not prepared to
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.920]   fight the future combat arena
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:09.920]   which will be the main arena of combat
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:11.920]   quote, mega cities
[01:25:11.920 --> 01:25:13.920]   including New York City was one of them
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.920]   mentioned in the report, so they are gearing
[01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:17.920]   up the army to be stationed in
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.920]   occupying and combating
[01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:21.920]   insurgents, anti-government
[01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:23.920]   extremists and others and
[01:25:23.920 --> 01:25:25.920]   under medical emergencies was one of the other
[01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.920]   scenarios in mega cities
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:29.920]   within the next 20 years
[01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:31.920]   so then you can tie that back to the concerns
[01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:33.920]   about Ebola victims
[01:25:33.920 --> 01:25:35.920]   going to highly populated cities
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:37.920]   like Mexico City for example
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.920]   or indeed Paris because there are
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:41.920]   many African immigrants in France
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:43.920]   that go back and forth between these West African
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:45.920]   countries, so I mean that is the
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.920]   concern that an Ebola sufferer
[01:25:47.920 --> 01:25:49.920]   would land in a major city and it
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:51.920]   would spread more rapidly
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:53.920]   because these Western African countries are quite
[01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:55.920]   sparsely populated of course
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.920]   Africa is a huge continent in comparison
[01:25:57.920 --> 01:25:59.920]   to these mega cities where it could
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.920]   spread very much more quickly and
[01:26:01.920 --> 01:26:03.920]   to a more devastating effect
[01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.920]   Totally agree, our next caller is O'Brien
[01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.920]   O'Brien what is your question?
[01:26:07.920 --> 01:26:09.920]   Yes
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:11.920]   basically
[01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.920]   if the State Department
[01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:15.920]   is going to be buying all
[01:26:15.920 --> 01:26:17.920]   this
[01:26:17.920 --> 01:26:19.920]   hazmat gear for their
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.920]   for their
[01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.920]   diplomats
[01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:25.920]   wouldn't they need to be
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.920]   wouldn't the CDC need to do that as well?
[01:26:27.920 --> 01:26:29.920]   Well
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:31.920]   I bet the CDC probably has a lot
[01:26:31.920 --> 01:26:33.920]   of this stuff, who knows whether
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.920]   it needs to be upgraded after
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:37.920]   time but that is interesting
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:39.920]   Paul what do you think, why does the State Department
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:41.920]   need this stuff?
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:43.920]   I don't know whether they would then hand it
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:45.920]   on to the public health authorities
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:47.920]   that's what I'm assuming would happen but
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:49.920]   I mean I was astonished by
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.920]   the sheer number of it, 160,000
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:53.920]   I'm sure they've already got a lot of them in supply
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:55.920]   and stock already so
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:57.920]   but you know they did the same thing with the potassium
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:59.920]   iodide pills after Fukushima
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:01.920]   so they make sure that they're prepared
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:03.920]   while the vast majority of
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:05.920]   Americans are not, I mean they rolled
[01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:07.920]   back some of those previous measures
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.920]   in the context of nuclear
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:11.920]   power plants where people who live
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:13.920]   nearby were given adequate supplies of
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:15.920]   potassium iodide pills
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:17.920]   so you know they're concerned about
[01:27:17.920 --> 01:27:19.920]   themselves not so concerned about
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.920]   the American people it seems when they make these
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:23.920]   large scale purchases
[01:27:23.920 --> 01:27:25.920]   whether they're actually going to foresee
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:27.920]   a pandemic event
[01:27:27.920 --> 01:27:29.920]   is unknown but they're definitely going to be prepared
[01:27:29.920 --> 01:27:31.920]   for it. If there is a Titanic
[01:27:31.920 --> 01:27:33.920]   like event I think the government will
[01:27:33.920 --> 01:27:35.920]   be the first ones into the lifeboats and then it'll
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:37.920]   be women and children and the rich
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.920]   and if you're not one of those
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:41.920]   people you're going to have to fend for yourself you're going to prepare
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.920]   you know which is why
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.920]   one reason it's good to
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.920]   know what colloidal silver does for
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:49.920]   your body I'm just going to do this for a quick plug
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.920]   silver bullet is one of the
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:53.920]   Infowars life family of
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:55.920]   I guess
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:27:57.920]   health remedies that you could use for
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:59.920]   yourself you know I use colloidal silver
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:01.920]   a lot personally and
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.920]   one thing I also make a lot of it
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:05.920]   and one thing I do with the silver bullet is I
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.920]   take it and I mix it in with
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.920]   my batches that aren't as strong
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:11.920]   this is a 30 parts per million strength which is very
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:13.920]   strong and that's harder to make
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:15.920]   in your home laboratory
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.920]   but I make about 10 parts per million
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.920]   and then I add that in anytime I get a
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:21.920]   sniffle or anything I shoot it up my nose
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.920]   breathe it in and that's what I do
[01:28:23.920 --> 01:28:25.920]   you're welcome to do what you want with it
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:27.920]   but silver bullet available at

[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:03.920]   saying that there's a terror alert on Monday
[01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:05.920]   about a potential forfeiture situation
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:07.920]   the police are shoving people shoving Alex

[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:19.920]   is this another false flag stage attack to take our
