[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well

[00:19.040 --> 00:33.880]  Texas Alex Jones the answer to 1984 in 1776 worldwide the social engineers
[00:33.880 --> 00:39.960]  financed by unlimited globalist fiat currency are attempting to domesticate
[00:39.960 --> 00:46.040]  the population and train us to be servile minions of their systems but at the
[00:46.040 --> 00:51.600]  same time the spirit of liberty is reawakening across the planet as the
[00:51.600 --> 00:55.480]  world government comes more and more out in the open the people are being stirred
[00:55.480 --> 01:03.520]  from their deep slumbers it is the 25th day of April 2011 on this Monday
[01:03.520 --> 01:06.920]  edition dr. Paul Craig Roberts former head of policy department of the
[01:06.920 --> 01:11.320]  Treasury will be joining us to break down the incredible economic news I have
[01:11.320 --> 01:15.960]  flown Wayne Madsen to Austin for a video interview for an upcoming documentary
[01:15.960 --> 01:21.000]  but he'll be popping in later today and tomorrow in studio with us he just
[01:21.000 --> 01:26.680]  arrived in Austin minutes ago or his plane's coming in I know we got people
[01:26.680 --> 01:32.920]  there picking him up going through this news and information obviously things
[01:32.920 --> 01:39.040]  are getting crazier by the minute if you go back a decade ago or more when we had
[01:39.040 --> 01:44.040]  economists on breaking down that as they sold derivatives in the world market
[01:44.040 --> 01:49.720]  pegged of the dollar that that would cause a dollar devaluation when they
[01:49.720 --> 01:53.320]  tried to basically prop those derivatives up that was always planned here
[01:53.320 --> 01:59.800]  are the headlines dollars decline speeds up China's planning to cut US reserves
[01:59.800 --> 02:08.960]  by two-thirds bombshell golden silver continue to surge just got chills that's
[02:08.960 --> 02:13.440]  why last Monday I got chills on air when standard and pores came out and said the
[02:13.440 --> 02:19.720]  outlook for the dollar in the future is not good it's a grim and the triple A
[02:19.720 --> 02:28.000]  rating is grim IMF bombshell age of America nears end IMF World Bank run by
[02:28.000 --> 02:31.720]  the very same Federal Reserve that dominates this country that's why
[02:31.720 --> 02:37.320]  Geithner says we need more debt because we're in debt to him through made-up debt
[02:37.320 --> 02:44.600]  it'd be like if I could take a pin and just have government authorization to
[02:44.600 --> 02:55.480]  say that this was a trillion dollar note and get people to accept it and if I had
[02:55.480 --> 02:59.520]  the police and military backing it up and I just wrote out a trillion dollar
[02:59.520 --> 03:04.320]  note right here and now now I go I'll loan you this trillion dollars I just
[03:04.320 --> 03:07.960]  wrote this on the back of a folder but I'm the private fellow reserve so here's
[03:07.960 --> 03:11.520]  the trillion and now you're gonna give me all your rights for this you're gonna
[03:11.520 --> 03:14.480]  pay me interest and I get all the land and I get to set all the regulations
[03:14.480 --> 03:18.280]  here it is I just made it up but I paid off your politicians so they're gonna
[03:18.280 --> 03:24.680]  accept it the trillion dollars is mine and it's it's just unbelievable this is
[03:24.680 --> 03:30.440]  all happening Ron Paul to announces 2012 presidential run within days Steve
[03:30.440 --> 03:37.040]  Watson has this key report with inside info up on prisonplanet.com and
[03:37.040 --> 03:43.000]  infowars.com obviously and I told you last week that we would see this by
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.040]  this week and I don't even have the staff to be marking these predictions down
[03:47.040 --> 03:49.400]  but you all heard it over and over again I challenged some of the great
[03:49.400 --> 03:54.800]  listeners who check out prisonplanet.tv to go cull through this last week and
[03:54.800 --> 03:58.080]  to post it on YouTube and write an article about it just because it's a
[03:58.080 --> 04:03.320]  nice trick to show the uninitiated knows and aren't informed I can make films
[04:03.320 --> 04:07.200]  about a decade ago I can make films about it two years ago I can talk about
[04:07.200 --> 04:12.200]  a thousands of times but if they see the YouTube timestamp it tends to wake
[04:12.200 --> 04:16.840]  them up a little bit I told you that by this week just estimating how the media
[04:16.840 --> 04:22.920]  works first they said oh Apple spies on you a week ago and then oh the droid via
[04:22.920 --> 04:27.840]  Google spies on you and then oh the other phones and now the headlines Wall
[04:27.840 --> 04:33.680]  Street Journal New York Times all phones are spying on you and that's the way it
[04:33.680 --> 04:39.400]  is and yes the government asked them to so now what's introduced the slaves here's
[04:39.400 --> 04:43.920]  the big headline at infowars.com investigation government ordered
[04:43.920 --> 04:50.680]  cell phone companies to spy on users this was all ordered and of course it's
[04:50.680 --> 04:54.600]  all dues for you 15 year old for my listeners but but now it's new though
[04:54.600 --> 04:57.400]  because they're now admitting it and we're gonna be breaking all that down as

[08:08.920 --> 08:29.800]  it is Monday the 25th day of April 2011 if the former head of policy the
[08:29.800 --> 08:33.480]  Department of Treasury Dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us to deal with this
[08:33.480 --> 08:40.600]  headline that's up at info wars.com IMF bombshell well it's not a bombshell for
[08:40.600 --> 08:44.360]  this audience it's old news the traders that run our country have been
[08:44.360 --> 08:48.960]  maneuvering us into bankruptcy for a long time and preparing the global
[08:48.960 --> 08:53.760]  economic implosion to be blamed on us and the military tyranny to be blamed on
[08:53.760 --> 08:59.080]  the US after we supplied the New World Order with the finances and the muscle to
[08:59.080 --> 09:05.120]  carry out their takeover they're done with us IMF bombshell age of America
[09:05.120 --> 09:11.480]  nears end China's economy will surpass the United States and China
[09:11.480 --> 09:17.840]  prepares to dump its US Treasury reserves by two-thirds that will signal the
[09:17.840 --> 09:24.680]  complete implosion of the dollar and it will wreak unmitigated havoc meanwhile
[09:24.680 --> 09:31.080]  gold and silver are continuing to surge on this news not because gold and
[09:31.080 --> 09:37.040]  silver are worth more global currencies are being devalued in a concerted
[09:37.040 --> 09:43.160]  triangulated effort for the first time the international organization has set a
[09:43.160 --> 09:47.320]  date for the moment when the age of America will end and the US economy
[09:47.320 --> 09:52.400]  will be overtaken by China and they're going to say it's closer than you think
[09:52.400 --> 09:57.040]  they went on to say 2016 and of course they're just getting you ready for it
[09:57.040 --> 10:02.760]  it's already taking place the globalist through globalism through NAFTA GATT
[10:02.760 --> 10:11.440]  and other laws have moved our shores our jobs offshore and it is just now a
[10:11.440 --> 10:16.360]  foregone conclusion unless we reverse ourselves and get out of globalism
[10:16.360 --> 10:20.360]  continuing that was a headline on a market watch a division the Wall Street
[10:20.360 --> 10:27.080]  Journal this is out of CNBC don't like a weak dollar might as well get used to
[10:27.080 --> 10:34.600]  it here's another headline gold and silver continue to surge gold hit a
[10:34.600 --> 10:39.600]  record high while silver surge more than 5% to within a whisker of its all-time
[10:39.600 --> 10:46.640]  peak as the dollar continues to decline and inflation concerns drove haven flows
[10:46.640 --> 10:54.720]  that is capital into what's seen as safe havens now remember that the politicians
[10:54.720 --> 11:01.240]  told you that QE 1 QE 2 now they're talking about QE 3 calling that a
[11:01.240 --> 11:06.320]  continuation of QE 2 it won't be called QE 3 to be called a expansion of QE 2
[11:06.320 --> 11:11.880]  flooding the world with dollars other currencies going down as well but not as
[11:11.880 --> 11:16.360]  fast as the dollar the decline led by the dollar they told you that was going
[11:16.360 --> 11:21.040]  to be a good thing for the economy they told you globalism NAFTA GATT China
[11:21.040 --> 11:26.080]  having tariffs on our goods the US not having tariffs on theirs China having a
[11:26.080 --> 11:31.840]  lower currency our currency being above theirs China not allowing independent
[11:31.840 --> 11:39.600]  companies in only insiders all of this set up a consolidation of the global
[11:39.600 --> 11:48.760]  markets in a handful of people's grasp and globalism is a predatory financial
[11:48.760 --> 11:54.120]  warfare system the globalists don't want a free market they want a crony
[11:54.120 --> 12:04.520]  insider system where they are exempt from the taxes Exxon mobile of course GE
[12:04.520 --> 12:10.320]  the list goes on and on Google paying 2.4 percent taxes so they set up
[12:10.320 --> 12:15.000]  globalism where no one can compete with them and then they call that free market
[12:15.000 --> 12:24.160]  and have a gaggle of fake libertarians who are basically out there pushing the
[12:24.160 --> 12:29.200]  public towards quote privatization and quote free trade when it's not
[12:29.200 --> 12:33.560]  privatization and it's not free trade when government comes in and only allows
[12:33.560 --> 12:38.200]  certain corporations to bid to take over infrastructure and then they
[12:38.200 --> 12:43.920]  basically increase the prices and the corporations just step into the position
[12:43.920 --> 12:50.280]  of government itself so again let me just read to these headlines IMF see
[12:50.280 --> 12:54.600]  how good globalism has been for us see see how it's delivered the end of the
[12:54.600 --> 12:58.720]  industrial economy then they promised it'll be a great service economy now
[12:58.720 --> 13:05.920]  that economy is withering on the vine IMF bombshell age of America nears end
[13:05.920 --> 13:16.120]  commentary China's economy will surpass US in 2016 continuing don't like a week
[13:16.120 --> 13:22.640]  dollar might as well get used to it CNBC here's a report out of the official
[13:22.640 --> 13:30.200]  Chinese government news agency China should cap 4x reserves at 1.3 trillion
[13:30.200 --> 13:36.080]  US dollars and they go on to signal that they may cut their purchases by two
[13:36.080 --> 13:41.720]  thirds of the dollar they've already announced last year they're moving away
[13:41.720 --> 13:47.400]  from allowing people to purchase things in China with dollars you've got to do
[13:47.400 --> 13:55.320]  it in their currency the yawn meanwhile remember OPEC last Monday came out and
[13:55.320 --> 14:04.640]  said hey in Reuters we're going to cut oil production because there's not
[14:04.640 --> 14:09.120]  enough demand now now this is while publicly available information shows
[14:09.120 --> 14:15.360]  demand is at all-time highs prices are surging globally and their answer is to
[14:15.360 --> 14:21.320]  slash output which will only send the prices up higher and there's one thing
[14:21.320 --> 14:26.680]  our media has been denying for years why oil prices have gone up and it's
[14:26.680 --> 14:31.400]  predominantly because globally oil is denominated in dollars if you want to go
[14:31.400 --> 14:35.120]  to Saudi Arabia or you want to go to Libya or you want to come to the United
[14:35.120 --> 14:38.520]  States or you want to go to the Brazilian oil companies you want to go to the
[14:38.520 --> 14:44.060]  Dutch or the British oil companies you buy the oil in the dollar and so the
[14:44.060 --> 14:51.880]  dollars being devalued it's elementary my dear Watson it's so elementary and in
[14:51.880 --> 14:56.040]  years past when people talked about this like Ron Paul three years ago in the
[14:56.040 --> 14:59.520]  last presidential campaign he got laughed at because the globalists know
[14:59.520 --> 15:03.840]  that the mainline yuppies don't have a brain cell to rub together two brain
[15:03.840 --> 15:09.880]  cells rub together and so as long as the system laughs on the news like salacious
[15:09.880 --> 15:14.980]  crumbs sitting on job in the hutch shoulder as long as they do that well
[15:14.980 --> 15:19.520]  the general public who likes to be con and to be ignorant slaves they giggle and
[15:19.520 --> 15:23.080]  snicker as well like they're giggling and snickering listening right now they
[15:23.080 --> 15:27.240]  think this is all funny the high gas prices the dollar plunging they think
[15:27.240 --> 15:32.080]  it's all cute because they like to get conned and hurt real bad now more and
[15:32.080 --> 15:36.560]  more people are are waking up breaking their giggling trance and are actually
[15:36.560 --> 15:42.240]  becoming concerned with what's happening IMF bombshell age of America nears
[15:42.240 --> 15:46.440]  end how many years did we tell you this was the globalist plan you know we knew
[15:46.440 --> 15:50.200]  from the 1975 trilateral Commission reports that were public where they
[15:50.200 --> 15:56.160]  described how in the next 30 plus years they had a strategic plan to globalize
[15:56.160 --> 16:00.280]  systems create standardized systems behind the scenes then have a global
[16:00.280 --> 16:05.440]  currency war and then global devaluation and on the ashes of that build a new
[16:05.440 --> 16:11.200]  economic currency order you'd still have euros you'd still have yon's yin's
[16:11.200 --> 16:16.360]  dollars but they will be denominated and stabilized that's the quote by this
[16:16.360 --> 16:22.840]  new private banking cartel that will control through the g20 the currencies
[16:22.840 --> 16:27.600]  the interest rates that will allow even greater vertical integration and insider
[16:27.600 --> 16:33.000]  trading and that's why the German stock exchange just basically bought the New
[16:33.000 --> 16:40.760]  York stock exchange it's all consolidating into one system right down so
[16:40.760 --> 16:44.280]  they can accelerate the fraud so they can accelerate the squeezing of the
[16:44.280 --> 16:48.440]  public so there's no free market no underground market no local market
[16:48.440 --> 16:53.320]  everything controlled by them and the fiat currency they issue the digital
[16:53.320 --> 16:57.040]  money that they get the planet for and you know I described it the last segment
[16:57.040 --> 17:00.960]  if you're not watching on prison planet dot TV but listening on the radio I took
[17:00.960 --> 17:08.640]  a manila folder and I basically put a trillion dollars on there how many zeros
[17:08.640 --> 17:17.600]  does a trillion have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 2021 how many
[17:17.600 --> 17:24.240]  zeros does a trillion have let me see you know these numbers get so large the
[17:24.240 --> 17:27.680]  point is I could write a trillion I could write a billion I could write a
[17:27.680 --> 17:36.280]  quadrillion I could write just so so so this is way more than a trillion a
[17:36.280 --> 17:44.920]  trillion has 12 you know I've put 21 numbers here what's 21 I guess that's a
[17:44.920 --> 17:49.240]  quadrillion or more so you know the globalist have created over 1.5
[17:49.240 --> 17:53.600]  quadrillion so you they just basically right on the back of a manila envelope
[17:53.600 --> 17:57.880]  and they just issue it and then they say will you sell your sovereignty will you
[17:57.880 --> 18:03.280]  sell your liberty police will you crack heads for $30,000 a year teachers will
[18:03.280 --> 18:07.840]  you dump people down for 30,000 will you sell your soul and the public just falls
[18:07.840 --> 18:12.840]  down before the idols of the New World Order made up out of nothing you know
[18:12.840 --> 18:16.720]  it's got more air in it than cotton candy and even less nutrition in it
[18:16.720 --> 18:21.320]  psychically and they just bite into it and just say we are ready to sell out

[19:07.760 --> 19:12.280]  want it and the system says okay slit your throat it's cool and they could lay

[19:16.560 --> 19:20.280]  and they would sit there and slit their throat their children's throats if it was

[22:06.960 --> 22:10.280]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[22:10.280 --> 22:15.280]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US
[22:15.280 --> 22:20.200]  bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by
[22:20.200 --> 22:23.840]  calling them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying

[24:13.840 --> 24:18.800]  deluding ourselves that not having a bill of rights and Constitution is cute
[24:18.800 --> 24:26.280]  is enslavement and enslavement isn't cute or funny you know Africa her capita
[24:26.280 --> 24:33.400]  has many times more resources than North America Latin America Southern North
[24:33.400 --> 24:40.320]  America Mexico has many times the resources of North America many analysts
[24:40.320 --> 24:46.800]  pegged it about three times the soils value gold oil you name it but they
[24:46.800 --> 24:51.640]  have giant poor populations because they never got a shot at liberty they
[24:51.640 --> 24:55.560]  never got a shot at private property for the general public they never got a
[24:55.560 --> 25:00.720]  shot at a true free market the United States hadn't been perfect but compared
[25:00.720 --> 25:05.480]  to any other culture in the world it has outperformed everything and so the
[25:05.480 --> 25:10.280]  globalists came here took it over use it as an engine to expand the British
[25:10.280 --> 25:14.760]  Empire model and now they're done with us they have turned us into from the
[25:14.760 --> 25:19.120]  greatest creditor nation of the greatest debtor nation and that's why
[25:19.120 --> 25:23.840]  Geithner says expand the debt that's the answer because bankrupting us use the
[25:23.840 --> 25:28.960]  gold that's always the central bankers gold and so I was very nasty last
[25:28.960 --> 25:33.920]  segment because this is a nasty situation I am totally disgusted and
[25:33.920 --> 25:37.600]  freaked out by what's happening because I know what it's gonna mean during this
[25:37.600 --> 25:41.920]  depression they're gonna sick the blue collar folks a lot of which are great
[25:41.920 --> 25:46.480]  patriots and fully aware of what's happening and who work very hard but
[25:46.480 --> 25:49.560]  they're gonna sick some of the socialistic blue collar people and the
[25:49.560 --> 25:54.040]  welfare hordes on the rest of the blue collar workers the lower middle class the
[25:54.040 --> 26:00.120]  middle class the nouveau riche and the independent wealthy and the war is on
[26:00.120 --> 26:06.600]  they are gonna sit there with class warfare and they're gonna release as the
[26:06.600 --> 26:10.200]  banksters have done in countless third world countries in Eastern Europe the
[26:10.200 --> 26:15.000]  disenfranchised hordes of people who are gonna get their welfare and their
[26:15.000 --> 26:18.280]  social security and their Medicare and their Medicaid card as part of
[26:18.280 --> 26:22.240]  austerity they're gonna sick them on the general public and tell them raise taxes
[26:22.240 --> 26:28.440]  and you'll get your subsidy back and then of course it won't materialize but
[26:28.440 --> 26:32.840]  that won't matter and and and a lot of folks say well why is California raising
[26:32.840 --> 26:37.080]  taxes why are the feds trying when they know Kennedy cut taxes by around 50
[26:37.080 --> 26:42.720]  percent and tax receipts doubled why does government want to raise taxes they
[26:42.720 --> 26:46.640]  want to destroy wealth they want to destroy their competition they are
[26:46.640 --> 26:54.720]  exempt offshore the fortune 100 pay less than 5% taxes on average domestic
[26:54.720 --> 27:00.720]  corporations it's around nine okay but most of them are international you've
[27:00.720 --> 27:04.240]  got to understand that ladies and gentlemen but then of yourself employed
[27:04.240 --> 27:08.000]  and run your own business your own sole proprietorship or domestic
[27:08.000 --> 27:15.200]  corporation you pay 40% corporate tax 35% individually and and they've got the
[27:15.200 --> 27:21.040]  CPAs as these kept minions and they will not give you the exemptions that are
[27:21.040 --> 27:25.120]  there and then if you don't go with a big CPA you get audited and they come in
[27:25.120 --> 27:29.240]  and say we're disallowing these these exemptions we don't care if the law says
[27:29.240 --> 27:34.880]  you get them it's designed to shut down their competition and I know that you
[27:34.880 --> 27:39.320]  know that but we better get this message out to people and we better do it fast
[27:39.320 --> 27:45.880]  because the plan has always been to kill the dollar and then to come out with the
[27:45.880 --> 27:51.880]  new bandcore IMF World Bank digital currency that controls all the other
[27:51.880 --> 27:55.760]  currencies and then they're going to stabilize them for a while once we
[27:55.760 --> 28:00.240]  accept this system and then start the next round of financial implosions
[28:00.240 --> 28:06.240]  case point example for the last decade the globalist slash taxes through the
[28:06.240 --> 28:11.360]  politicians they controlled in Ireland made it the center of investment tried
[28:11.360 --> 28:17.680]  to pass two years ago and then again last year the entry of Ireland into the EU
[28:17.680 --> 28:23.280]  now they went from the biggest creditor per capita the fastest growing economy
[28:23.280 --> 28:30.320]  per capita the biggest creditor all of it overnight being told they were
[28:30.320 --> 28:35.400]  bankrupt last year within one month of them voting to join the euro the euro
[28:35.400 --> 28:40.320]  was a contract agreeing to letting private central banks come in to take over
[28:40.320 --> 28:45.440]  the country and the head of the Irish central bank told the BBC and other
[28:45.440 --> 28:48.840]  papers in a speech I read the headline over and over again remember a few
[28:48.840 --> 28:53.600]  months ago he said it's good to have foreign banks own and run Ireland yes
[28:53.600 --> 28:57.640]  we don't really owe this money ourselves but we're signing on to the debt of the
[28:57.640 --> 29:03.400]  banks same thing with Iceland same thing with other countries I mean it's so
[29:03.400 --> 29:11.720]  incredibly naked in how corrupted is but they only get away with this because
[29:11.720 --> 29:17.000]  the people are so incredibly ignorant about finance I mean it is off the charts
[29:17.000 --> 29:21.920]  in fact folks I keep mentioning that let's try to pull that up from BBC it was
[29:21.920 --> 29:27.200]  also in several other publications head of central bank of Ireland it's good to
[29:27.200 --> 29:30.920]  have foreign banks owning our banks that was the quote I want to show that when
[29:30.920 --> 29:33.920]  they come back and then I'm gonna go through this news and then the even
[29:33.920 --> 29:40.640]  bigger news it's not news to our audience investigation government ordered
[29:40.640 --> 29:45.600]  cell phone companies to spy on users and finally the mainstream media is
[29:45.600 --> 29:50.960]  admitting but we told you 15 years ago we'll be right back stay with us we're
[29:50.960 --> 30:02.080]  on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network hundreds
[30:02.080 --> 30:06.440]  of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our last
[30:06.440 --> 30:11.440]  chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda they'll be
[30:11.440 --> 30:15.040]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I have tremendous
[30:15.040 --> 30:20.120]  influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I
[30:20.120 --> 30:25.440]  think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for
[30:25.440 --> 30:30.360]  the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[30:30.360 --> 30:34.760]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[30:34.760 --> 30:38.480]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're asking for more
[30:38.480 --> 30:42.440]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[30:42.440 --> 30:48.080]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[30:48.080 --> 30:53.720]  Republic get your copy of full of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com

[31:03.800 --> 31:07.760]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[31:07.760 --> 31:12.040]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[31:12.040 --> 31:16.320]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[31:16.320 --> 31:20.680]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[31:20.680 --> 31:24.760]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[31:24.760 --> 31:29.320]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[31:29.320 --> 31:33.440]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[31:33.440 --> 31:37.440]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power

[33:42.840 --> 33:48.640]  open phones but sometimes I pose the question on certain topics I want to
[33:48.640 --> 33:55.840]  hear your view on the massive warrantless wiretapping and tracking via
[33:55.840 --> 34:03.080]  federal law 1996 now public information it was always public in the law but now
[34:03.080 --> 34:07.000]  finally getting admitted to I want to get your view on this I mean just five
[34:07.000 --> 34:11.120]  years ago Bush was giving speeches saying how dare you say we're spying on
[34:11.120 --> 34:15.520]  American citizens without warrants I promise we're not we're only listening
[34:15.520 --> 34:21.520]  to Al Qaeda overseas and not following these FISA warrants then it turned out he
[34:21.520 --> 34:29.160]  was completely lying 1996 under federal law they said by October 1st 2001 they
[34:29.160 --> 34:34.880]  said you got five years that all cell phones by law will be satellite
[34:34.880 --> 34:38.840]  triangulated via the cell towers and the government has to have a backdoor to
[34:38.840 --> 34:44.880]  dial in even when the phone is off and to be able to track everywhere you're
[34:44.880 --> 34:49.840]  going and to listen to you and they built backdoors in the computers and
[34:49.840 --> 34:55.480]  backdoors to have telecommunications floors in every major to colocation
[34:55.480 --> 35:04.920]  facility run by the NSA I mean I told you a decade plus before the executive at
[35:04.920 --> 35:10.200]  AT&T went public in San Francisco that the government isn't tapping the phone
[35:10.200 --> 35:15.480]  companies the government is the phone companies because I read the Telecommunications
[35:15.480 --> 35:21.160]  Act there's nothing more frustrating than knowing all of this and sitting
[35:21.160 --> 35:26.800]  there and warning people and having folks call me a conspiracy theorist in fact
[35:26.800 --> 35:31.280]  here's the headlines today researchers this is Bloomberg Business Week oh my
[35:31.280 --> 35:38.240]  gosh big breaking news iPhone location data already used by cops and it turns
[35:38.240 --> 35:44.160]  out they dial in and are able to use the information here's another one Apple we
[35:44.160 --> 35:50.800]  must have comprehensive user location data on you and they go on to say that
[35:50.800 --> 35:56.960]  they have to do this because of telecommunications laws see now that
[35:56.960 --> 36:01.960]  they're getting heat they're going yeah well we were told to do this
[36:02.080 --> 36:07.360]  continuing with police state news Napolitano TSA touching six-year-old was
[36:07.360 --> 36:14.800]  professional here's another one military patrols start Friday night in
[36:14.800 --> 36:23.240]  downtown Columbus Ohio oh yeah military patrols on the street that's WRBL TV CBS
[36:23.240 --> 36:29.040]  here's another one TSA an army of pervs and criminals new reports of child porn
[36:29.040 --> 36:33.880]  allegations with these people so that's just part of what we're going to be
[36:33.880 --> 36:38.480]  covering another video gets released of a guy in his own front yard videotaping
[36:38.480 --> 36:43.120]  people being arrested for burglary the cop comes over beats the living snot out
[36:43.120 --> 36:47.240]  of the guy who was polite and then charges him with assaulting him but the
[36:47.240 --> 36:51.160]  cops did the right thing in Las Vegas the prosecutor dropped the charges on the
[36:51.160 --> 36:55.600]  guy the cop beat up and released the video I got to say that's the right
[36:55.600 --> 37:00.120]  thing to do and it's sad that we've got to commend the Las Vegas police
[37:00.120 --> 37:06.240]  department for doing the right thing because they're going after this cop
[37:06.240 --> 37:10.760]  now when when the cops beat somebody up and frame him normally they go ahead and
[37:10.760 --> 37:14.880]  go along with it and would erase that video how do we know we've seen videos
[37:14.880 --> 37:18.600]  where they beat people up erase their video but then somebody else shoots the
[37:18.600 --> 37:23.320]  video and catches a minute or the time the cop shot the guy in handcuffs in the
[37:23.320 --> 37:27.720]  back and then they claim the guy had assaulted him and they confiscated three
[37:27.720 --> 37:32.360]  cell phone cameras but somebody else down the platform and videotaped that so
[37:32.360 --> 37:35.080]  then the cops lied and they got caught and the guy got convicted I think only
[37:35.080 --> 37:38.880]  got like a year in jail for it but the point is is that this guy was totally
[37:38.880 --> 37:42.600]  polite the Las Vegas review journal breaks it down this guy was totally
[37:42.600 --> 37:47.520]  polite to the cops and the cop beats him up the others are supportive in the in
[37:47.520 --> 37:50.800]  the beat down and then they went ahead and charged him not only do they break
[37:50.800 --> 37:55.520]  his nose the cop knocks him to the ground starts punching him the guy says
[37:55.520 --> 37:58.440]  why are you doing this to me the cop kicks him right the nose and breaks his
[37:58.440 --> 38:02.680]  nose at that point he's knocked out and then they take him to jail and fill out
[38:02.680 --> 38:10.240]  a false report that he beat him up I mean who are these people that the police
[38:10.240 --> 38:15.640]  departments are hiring but again at least the cops reviewed the video and
[38:15.640 --> 38:22.160]  found out the cop was lying and then dropped the charges on the other guy so
[38:22.160 --> 38:30.920]  that's coming up as well LAPD helicopter forced to land by gunfire some
[38:30.920 --> 38:33.920]  lunatic it reports was outside just shooting a gun in the air so the
[38:33.920 --> 38:37.200]  helicopter responded and he shot the helicopter I think that's a terrible
[38:37.200 --> 38:40.600]  thing that that happened but all these people that talk about if we ever have
[38:40.600 --> 38:44.440]  a physical war with the globalist and who they got helicopters who they got
[38:44.440 --> 38:52.120]  they got weapons what did the Lebanese do three years ago in Israel with
[38:52.120 --> 38:58.400]  low-tech weapons against Israeli tanks they beat them why low-tech weapons
[38:58.400 --> 39:01.840]  against helicopters why did they beat them because they had the will to fight
[39:01.840 --> 39:07.400]  it's the will to fight that's unstoppable resistance is victory and I
[39:07.400 --> 39:10.640]  think it's terrible that obviously some lunatic was outside just shooting a gun
[39:10.640 --> 39:15.160]  in the air and this happened my whole point is those that say that high-tech
[39:15.160 --> 39:19.360]  military force is impossible to beat nothing can stop highly motivated
[39:19.360 --> 39:24.480]  asymmetrical warfare if you're willing to give up your life no one can stop you
[39:24.480 --> 39:29.840]  okay let me let's just get that straight nothing can stop will nothing can stop
[39:29.840 --> 39:39.200]  motivation and initiative all right now if you just joined is I'm gonna read
[39:39.200 --> 39:42.880]  these financial headlines to you again this is why I was so shaken last week
[39:42.880 --> 39:50.800]  on air just by the magnitude of it and I likened it to standing at the edge of
[39:50.800 --> 39:54.360]  a cliff you it's not even when I stand on the edge of a cliff I'm not even
[39:54.360 --> 40:01.120]  scared I'm just tingling and super alive like having cold ice water thrown on
[40:01.120 --> 40:10.000]  you it's it's it's brisk it's it's electric it awakens you and when S&P
[40:10.000 --> 40:14.960]  came out highly political and reported what we've known for many years and said
[40:14.960 --> 40:19.400]  the outlook is grim for triple a rating for the US because that's how the
[40:19.400 --> 40:23.400]  bankers have maneuvered us they've gotten us towards this third world debt
[40:23.400 --> 40:28.360]  slave banana Republic position they've maneuvered us to this position this was
[40:28.360 --> 40:33.600]  done by design it's admitted in the 2002 IMF World Bank documents that what
[40:33.600 --> 40:36.720]  they've done to the third world they were getting ready to do to Europe in the
[40:36.720 --> 40:40.560]  United States and they're bringing down Portugal they're bringing down Spain
[40:40.560 --> 40:44.520]  they're bringing down Iceland they're bringing down Greece they're bringing
[40:44.520 --> 40:49.760]  down Ireland this is the goal this is what the EU and the North American Union
[40:49.760 --> 40:54.720]  have been designed to do bring us into financial bondage through fraud so when
[40:54.720 --> 41:00.680]  I talked about being being basically shaken last week because this is the
[41:00.680 --> 41:06.000]  beginning of the other shoe dropping and no I'm not pleased that we were right
[41:06.000 --> 41:10.440]  about gold and silver exploding in prices I'm not pleased that history
[41:10.440 --> 41:14.400]  isn't different this time oh it's been the same every time we know where this
[41:14.400 --> 41:19.320]  leads hyperinflation we know where these policies lead civil unrest that the
[41:19.320 --> 41:23.840]  globalist social engineers have been preparing for they create the climate
[41:23.840 --> 41:31.200]  for destabilization and then prepare to now poses the saviors we know exactly
[41:31.200 --> 41:38.360]  where all of this is going we've seen this over and over and over again and
[41:38.360 --> 41:43.800]  again that's what's so frustrating about this the solutions are a hundred percent
[41:43.800 --> 41:47.640]  clear who is to blame for this is a hundred percent clear that they're
[41:47.640 --> 41:53.760]  that they've premeditatedly done this is on record in triplicate and I have
[41:53.760 --> 41:58.080]  discussed for the general dumb down public because they're not just going
[41:58.080 --> 42:02.680]  to sit on the sidelines as they become repossessed slaves they're going to be
[42:02.680 --> 42:07.280]  and are being forged into a political weapon against those of us that are
[42:07.280 --> 42:11.160]  self-sufficient and intelligent and prepositioned ourselves through
[42:11.160 --> 42:17.240]  historical knowledge to make it through this we are the fat hogs that they want
[42:17.240 --> 42:23.480]  to bleed now and they've got an army of dumb down gibbering zombies politically
[42:23.480 --> 42:27.080]  that are very dangerous they got 30 million illegal aliens that'll do whatever
[42:27.080 --> 42:31.520]  they're told they've got tens of millions of people on welfare over 44 million on
[42:31.520 --> 42:36.240]  food stamps they've got the cops and the bureaucrats and the social workers and
[42:36.240 --> 42:40.360]  the unions and all of them half the public gets their money from the
[42:40.360 --> 42:45.720]  government one form or another and now they're going to be told take over the
[42:45.720 --> 42:49.680]  rest of society the police state will put food on your table and what do you
[42:49.680 --> 42:59.120]  think they're going to do many historians noted that during world war two
[42:59.120 --> 43:06.240]  especially in Germany bureaucrats boring really nondescript people are what
[43:06.240 --> 43:13.240]  energize the Nazi party and that it was that dull bureaucratic type that were
[43:13.240 --> 43:18.600]  thrilled in exercising power and doing brutal things to people and stealing
[43:18.600 --> 43:23.000]  property I mean it wasn't just the Jews by the way or the seventh day Adventists
[43:23.000 --> 43:27.480]  that the Nazis went after by the end they were robbing their neighbors by the
[43:27.480 --> 43:32.320]  end if they wanted your wife they would have you arrested my grandfather grew up
[43:32.320 --> 43:39.200]  in Dallas in a upper middle-class area and there was a rich German inventor the
[43:39.200 --> 43:44.480]  inventor of air conditioning that lived in the big mansion at the end of the
[43:44.480 --> 43:51.200]  street and my grandfather was friends with him and by the end of world war
[43:51.200 --> 43:58.320]  two he was completely broke and do you know why because the Nazis through the
[43:58.320 --> 44:04.040]  United States made him pay them every dime he had and then when he and then
[44:04.040 --> 44:08.840]  when he didn't have any money they made him go and my grandfather told me this
[44:08.840 --> 44:13.320]  story and I've seen similar ones in the news go into debt to give him every
[44:13.320 --> 44:18.480]  dime he had or they would kill his family in Germany relatives he had in
[44:18.480 --> 44:24.240]  Germany now that's what the Nazis did to basically everybody if you want to live
[44:24.240 --> 44:28.520]  under a system where the government has total arbitrary control and there's no
[44:28.520 --> 44:32.840]  checks and balances there is nothing more humiliating there is nothing more
[44:32.840 --> 44:39.480]  horrible nothing more disgusting than this but they got an army of control
[44:39.480 --> 44:45.720]  freaks who love it and who enjoy it every miscreant control freak is
[44:45.720 --> 44:51.080]  empowered in this system and it's up to good men and women to say no and to
[44:51.080 --> 44:53.800]  stand up against it
[44:56.560 --> 45:03.480]  continuing IMF bombshell age of America nears end IMF goes on to say the dollar
[45:03.480 --> 45:06.880]  is going to be removed as the World Reserve currency and China is going to
[45:06.880 --> 45:13.840]  replace us in the next four years here CNBC don't like a weak dollar might as
[45:13.840 --> 45:16.840]  well get used to it weakness in the US dollar which is causing everything to
[45:16.840 --> 45:22.520]  go up including gas prices well they finally admit it's the dollar I was
[45:22.520 --> 45:26.400]  the only mainline talk show host big national host four years ago who would
[45:26.400 --> 45:30.600]  say on air that it was dollar devaluation that was causing oil prices to go
[45:30.600 --> 45:34.600]  up that was the main driver some of it was speculation and other things and I
[45:34.600 --> 45:38.800]  would get countless calls and emails and people asking Alex explain this to me
[45:38.800 --> 45:42.720]  now how does a weak dollar do that I'm like okay well globally the dollars
[45:42.720 --> 45:47.200]  worth less because they printed more and so it takes more of them to buy it do
[45:47.200 --> 45:53.080]  you understand people said no I don't understand and I'm like how can you not
[45:53.080 --> 45:58.560]  understand well finally here it is weakness in the dollar which is causing
[45:58.560 --> 46:02.320]  everything to go up including gas prices food and stocks is unlikely to go away
[46:02.320 --> 46:07.080]  soon as the selling frenzy hits the currency market and until the last few
[46:07.080 --> 46:11.800]  weeks I would never hear mainstream media admit why the dollars being weakened
[46:11.800 --> 46:17.800]  and prices are growing up because the private Federal Reserve is devaluing it
[46:17.800 --> 46:26.160]  by monetizing 70 plus percent of the debt and if you study hyperinflation as
[46:26.160 --> 46:32.080]  you get into the final phases it accelerates from a crawl to a walk from
[46:32.080 --> 46:39.160]  a jog to a full breakneck sprint and right now the system's jogging they've
[46:39.160 --> 46:44.440]  gone from a walk to a jog and now they're signifying that the run and then
[46:44.440 --> 46:50.720]  the dash is about to start and it's like going to the doctor and hearing my
[46:50.720 --> 46:56.200]  country has terminal cancer and I just want to warn people I want to reverse it
[46:56.200 --> 47:04.920]  I want to stop it it's going to be so painful and it's not just going to be a
[47:04.920 --> 47:10.320]  depression we had a depression in the late 20s into the 30s and major
[47:10.320 --> 47:14.280]  universities you can pull these numbers up estimated that seven million died
[47:14.280 --> 47:20.760]  via malnutrition from malnutrition related starvation that's how it works
[47:20.760 --> 47:25.080]  you get skinny you get malnutrition then you get the flu and die or you get
[47:25.080 --> 47:28.320]  something that normally wouldn't kill somebody and it does seven million over
[47:28.320 --> 47:31.920]  that decade are estimated to have died from malnutrition or starvation and
[47:31.920 --> 47:36.800]  that's when the country was 90% self-sufficient 90% rural we're 10%
[47:36.800 --> 47:43.360]  rural and only half of that 10% you pull these numbers up they vary from 5% to
[47:43.360 --> 47:49.800]  6% that are self-sufficient of the 10% that are rural half or 5% or self-sufficient
[47:49.800 --> 47:56.120]  can you imagine what this is going to be like if it continues we're going to
[47:56.120 --> 48:00.280]  have a crash landing the question is will we get the landing gear down will we
[48:00.280 --> 48:04.440]  get the nose of the plane up enough so that maybe we just spin out and you know
[48:04.440 --> 48:09.080]  maybe damage the plane just a little bit well right now the plane's going
[48:09.080 --> 48:12.560]  straight down in a dive bomb right towards the ground and we're at about
[48:12.560 --> 48:17.600]  3,000 feet and going fast at about 600 miles an hour and we better start
[48:17.600 --> 48:22.680]  pulling that plane up or we don't have any chance and Geithner is saying we're
[48:22.680 --> 48:25.680]  going to have a default we're going to have hyperinflation we're going to have
[48:25.680 --> 48:29.920]  a depression if you don't go into more debt and raise more taxes to us when
[48:29.920 --> 48:34.200]  there's no amount of money that'll pay off the false black hole of derivatives
[48:34.200 --> 48:38.280]  that they got our traitorous Congress both parties to sign on to they are
[48:38.280 --> 48:43.360]  taking us directly dive bombing into a black hole and they designed it that way
[48:43.360 --> 48:50.200]  and they're counting on you being ignorant to not know it 100% I had
[48:50.200 --> 48:53.080]  Stewart Rhodes here last week and we shot a video that's going to be out later
[48:53.080 --> 48:58.520]  in the week first video in our new studio and he made the analogy of you've
[48:58.520 --> 49:02.920]  got the SS Titanic out there in the Atlantic Ocean it hits an iceberg the
[49:02.920 --> 49:08.280]  globalist steered into the iceberg and up pulls the SS you in and they're
[49:08.280 --> 49:12.320]  saying get on our global government thing we'll save you and Stewart said
[49:12.320 --> 49:19.840]  we need the USS Constitution to pull up and say no get get back on this ship we
[49:19.840 --> 49:24.240]  got on the globalist ship the Titanic that where they want us dependent where
[49:24.240 --> 49:27.920]  they want to wreck our society where they want to destroy the free market where
[49:27.920 --> 49:31.480]  they want to vertically consolidate wealth they've now wrecked it on purpose
[49:31.480 --> 49:35.120]  the boat is listening the furniture's falling off the life boats are gone
[49:35.120 --> 49:40.000]  people are falling off into the icy water and the UN ship has pulled up saying
[49:40.000 --> 49:46.240]  come to us we'll take care of you well the UN ship is even more depression more
[49:46.240 --> 49:51.720]  control more domestication more one-child policy as they announced last
[49:51.720 --> 49:58.920]  year in Cancun openly world government to carry out one-child policy Ted Turner
[49:58.920 --> 50:04.720]  well instead we need to get off the the NAFTA get globalist big government ship
[50:04.720 --> 50:16.080]  and get on the USS Constitution the USS 1776 the answer to 1984 is 1776 giving
[50:16.080 --> 50:20.640]  into tyranny always just makes the tyrants want more and they're doing
[50:20.640 --> 50:28.960]  this willfully and scientifically Aldous Huxley Julian Huxley his brother at the
[50:28.960 --> 50:38.400]  UN all of them heart and Russell all wrote about there have been tyrannies in
[50:38.400 --> 50:42.440]  the past but this one we're setting up is going to be scientific and and
[50:42.440 --> 50:46.520]  everything they wrote about the 20s and 30s they've now built see I have the
[50:46.520 --> 50:51.920]  complete blueprints they're public for you as well okay I'm gonna come back get
[50:51.920 --> 50:55.640]  into the cell phone situation and then we're gonna go to your phone calls for
[50:55.640 --> 51:02.240]  30 minutes in the next hour 1-800-259-9231 hi this is Alex Jones did
[51:02.240 --> 51:05.840]  you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret
[51:05.840 --> 51:09.080]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[51:09.080 --> 51:13.080]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true
[51:13.080 --> 51:16.760]  seeds about perform even golden silver before in this country and it's possible
[51:16.760 --> 51:20.440]  that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science have
[51:20.440 --> 51:24.880]  put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival
[51:24.880 --> 51:29.880]  seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and
[51:29.880 --> 51:33.160]  your family and here's the best part these seeds have not been genetically
[51:33.160 --> 51:37.280]  modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre

[54:26.760 --> 54:33.280]  any nation that's ever been called even semi-free to have the governments
[54:33.280 --> 54:38.320]  openly training the military to take on the people that's happening and being
[54:38.320 --> 54:43.280]  announced and rolled out quietly to have governments tracking you in live time
[54:43.280 --> 54:49.640]  listening to you having computers dial in and listen to you having laws on the
[54:49.640 --> 54:57.680]  books for 15 years same in Europe they pass similar laws the same year to have
[54:57.680 --> 55:02.440]  global standardization of the cell phones made in Japan Korea what do you
[55:02.440 --> 55:06.920]  think Japan and Korea do because they're ordered under federal law if
[55:06.920 --> 55:10.400]  they're going to sell phones in this company in this country that they've
[55:10.400 --> 55:14.360]  got to be satellite tracked they've got to have backdoors where the government
[55:14.360 --> 55:18.840]  can dial in and turn the phone on as a bugging device well they just go ahead
[55:18.840 --> 55:22.040]  and make all the phones that way and then their governments are given the
[55:22.040 --> 55:27.800]  specs and are able to dial in this is a unified continuity of agenda global
[55:27.800 --> 55:33.600]  architecture of control and there is a Paul Watson article that I asked him to
[55:33.600 --> 55:37.840]  do last week and we worked on last week but he got it out today and I'm not to
[55:37.840 --> 55:41.600]  my horn I just want you to understand we don't make stuff up remember I told
[55:41.600 --> 55:45.280]  you last week I said you watch in the next week they're gonna have mainstream
[55:45.280 --> 55:51.080]  news articles out admitting that yes all the phones are listening to you all the
[55:51.080 --> 55:56.440]  phones are tracking you and when you plug your iPhone or draw it into your
[55:56.440 --> 56:01.440]  computer to sync with the system it downloads all your locations it's
[56:01.440 --> 56:06.280]  transmitting them back live and here's the headlines researchers Bloomberg

[56:30.360 --> 56:37.840]  got the link to the telecommunications act of 96 and everything I broke down
[56:37.840 --> 56:41.600]  the lawmakers saying they want investigations well they ought to
[56:41.600 --> 56:50.440]  investigate themselves this is federal regulations now regulations don't
[56:50.440 --> 56:54.800]  trump law or precedent they don't care I mean I'm gonna expand on that I've had
[56:54.800 --> 57:01.400]  district attorneys on from major counties one out in San Francisco saying
[57:01.400 --> 57:04.560]  that if the government sticks their hands down your pants it's a felony and
[57:04.560 --> 57:07.880]  if they touch you on the outside it's a misdemeanor and it's sworn peace
[57:07.880 --> 57:13.560]  officers can't do that does the TSA care no they just do it the government knows

[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:25.800]  that went into effect October 1st 2001 the FCC has mandated that all wireless
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:32.400]  carriers track the location of their users down to 50 feet they actually

[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:43.560]  they're now saying look don't be mad at us it's federal regulations so we told
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:48.760]  you this 15 years ago it's now public you could have always gone mainstream
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:53.240]  media to the telecommunications act and read it but see back in 96 we were
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:57.160]  landed the free home of the brave there was no way this Alex Jones guy was
[01:01:57.160 --> 01:02:03.040]  telling the truth he was lying you know so many emails oh you just claim the
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:08.000]  Patriot Act is for all US citizens they wouldn't look at section 802 oh you just
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.920]  claim section 213 let's him break in your house without a warrant and not even
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:16.120]  tell you they were there oh you just claim the telecommunications act does
[01:02:16.120 --> 01:02:22.000]  this and that no I don't claim any of it I read it I cover it I watch it get
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:28.040]  implemented with horror and I'm not even a tech guy so there's all of that
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:33.200]  there's a bunch of Fukushima news of the radiation sickness and the ongoing
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:36.680]  cover-ups and the radiation levels increasing here in North America directly
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:43.400]  in line bizarre news dealing with troops on the streets of America it's all
[01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:47.080]  it's all coming up today and got out of Paul Craig Roberts joining us in about
[01:02:47.080 --> 01:02:53.840]  30 minutes Tim in Washington you're on the air go ahead hey hey buddy hey Alex
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.720]  how's it going today I'm doing alright right on you know honestly I don't know
[01:02:58.720 --> 01:03:03.000]  other than to do I can only describe it as being mind control nobody seems to
[01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:08.720]  care for a reason self-preservation all sudden is it's not fashionable it doesn't
[01:03:08.720 --> 01:03:12.080]  make any sense to me as far as being an organism well people have been tricked
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:18.280]  into being spectators and yes an amoeba will run from a hot needle you put in
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:22.600]  the water they'll run from the heat an amoeba has no brain it's a single cell
[01:03:22.600 --> 01:03:27.880]  bacteria but the average American will not run from tyranny or recognize it
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:31.680]  that they don't even have the instincts a dog has when it growls at somebody that
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:37.120]  it doesn't trust and nine times out of ten you know if a dog I've been to so
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:41.120]  many people's houses and they go man you must be a good guy my dogs growling
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.960]  bark at everybody and Charlie sheen has these pugs and for years I've gone to
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:48.240]  his house and he just always points out they just run up loving on me when they
[01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:51.440]  growling bark everybody else that's happened countless places I am a
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:56.960]  loving but also confident person and dogs pick up on that and I like dogs but
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:01.040]  but the other issue is we all know if a normal dog that doesn't market a lot of
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:05.080]  people does growl at somebody generally it turns out that person's a bad person
[01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:09.560]  that dog has a six cents well the general public doesn't have that anymore
[01:04:09.560 --> 01:04:13.520]  because they've turned into jellyfish that never respond to tyranny I'm gonna
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:18.320]  hold you over Tim has heard it ranting but finish up your point now my point
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:21.600]  was just that you know we have all of these things coming at us all at once
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.960]  and yet nobody seems to care they just like they'll get in the traffic and
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:28.400]  they'll get ran over by the car before they decide to get to the sidewalk and I
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:33.000]  just don't understand it ultimately I just think that it's it might be too late
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:36.480]  for some it might be way too late for people to understand what's going on
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:43.040]  before that way it just takes them over you're absolutely right do you want to
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:47.000]  elaborate on that point Tim we come back are you done I can elaborate sure
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.320]  yeah okay I want you to start back over because I interrupted you finish up that
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:57.080]  point then we'll go to Jared bin to race Tom and others toll free number to join

[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:12.440]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:19.960]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:28.520]  Alex Jones okay we're taking your phone calls what we told you 15 years ago is
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:33.040]  now all over the news the mainstream media at any time since 1996 could have
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:38.520]  gone to the telecommunications act and read we're all computers all cell phones
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:44.280]  all internet devices telecommunications devices have to be hooked into the
[01:08:44.280 --> 01:08:48.320]  government where they can remote control dial in and listen to you even when the
[01:08:48.320 --> 01:08:53.880]  phone is off and track you via cell phone triangulation and I would cover
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:57.480]  this 15 years ago and have telecommunications people on and I would
[01:08:57.480 --> 01:09:02.720]  get callers saying how dare you you know I work for the phone company you're a
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:06.640]  liar and we knew that they were liars just counting on people's ignorance and
[01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:12.760]  I would also talk about the digital cable boxes more than a decade ago had
[01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:17.520]  onboard microphones and I was told by engineers at the local cable company
[01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:22.720]  that indeed it looked like third parties were coming through and using those in
[01:09:22.720 --> 01:09:27.760]  the home that was before the digital cable boxes had a reason to have
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:32.200]  microphones on board and people would break them open and my listeners and
[01:09:32.200 --> 01:09:37.000]  find the microphones and didn't know why Google six years ago came out admitted
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:40.800]  yes we use the onboard cameras and microphones to listen to you but don't
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:47.200]  worry it's a computer with keywords and it's picking up audio and then we use
[01:09:47.200 --> 01:09:52.880]  that to tailor what type of ads to pitch at you now I got emails and calls
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:57.560]  saying you're a liar I'm like here's the prison planet com article here's the
[01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:03.080]  link to Google's press release see I'm giving you press releases by them on
[01:10:03.080 --> 01:10:07.400]  their website I'm giving you the telecommunications act at Watson's
[01:10:07.400 --> 01:10:12.160]  link to begin the day in his article if you're a new listener everybody's
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.920]  freaking out over in the last week over Apple and then Google with their
[01:10:16.920 --> 01:10:22.120]  Google phone and then oh AT&T and oh then this company and that company oh
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:28.080]  my gosh they're tracking where I met it's the telecommunications act that they
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:32.680]  welcome to the club but see 15 years ago if the media would have done their
[01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:36.960]  job people would have protested and gotten involved and reverse this they
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:42.880]  waited till it was implemented in 2001 under law pass in 1996 they had five
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:46.960]  years to get it in place they waited till it was out there and now the police
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:51.960]  are using it all over the country I remember reading two years before in
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:55.720]  some trade publications that they were going to use the on-star to listen to
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:11:01.000]  you now it's admitted they use that to listen to you mainstream news but here
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.160]  it is researchers Bloomberg business week location and data already being used
[01:11:06.160 --> 01:11:11.040]  by cops the news in quotes that iPhones and iPads keep track of where you go has
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:18.200]  been known in forensic circles for some time oh really yeah they knew for 15
[01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:23.200]  years and didn't tell you here's another one Apple we must have comprehensive
[01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:29.120]  user location data on you this is out of the IB times because it's the FCC
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:34.000]  regulation so see now the yuppies are ready to hear the truth so get the
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:39.400]  article at info wars.com it's linked to all of the information and you could
[01:11:39.400 --> 01:11:42.520]  send this out to everyone you know investigation government ordered
[01:11:42.520 --> 01:11:48.880]  cell phone companies to spy on users okay it was ordered get it straight and
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:53.920]  yes it's illegal but who needs stinking warrants when the demonic chipmunk
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:58.960]  Janet Napolitano is ordering a bunch of perverts and thieves to stick their
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.400]  hands down your pants it's self a felony they don't care they just do it
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:08.680]  they're called tyrants all right I'm ranting Tim in Washington than Jared
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:13.920]  Ben Tom Mike and others go ahead Tim all right you're totally right about it I
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:18.520]  mean what the people are going to they'll get upset for a little bit but
[01:12:18.520 --> 01:12:22.200]  all they have to do is say cell phone lottery and then all the zombies will
[01:12:22.200 --> 01:12:26.520]  love it again it's a very frustrating system that we live in and I appreciate
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:30.960]  your efforts to divulge the system that's been created around me thank you
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:35.600]  very much Alex thank you Tim anything else all right thank you so much Tim
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:41.200]  Jared in Nebraska Jared you're on the air Alex thank you very much for having
[01:12:41.200 --> 01:12:47.480]  me on I am my question is a little convoluted here but I'll get to the
[01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:52.760]  bottom of it I've been studying like the UN billabourg group the club of Rome
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:59.600]  all kind of the whole round table of the global agenda my question is we have
[01:12:59.600 --> 01:13:04.960]  verses in the Bible in the Bible that say things like I can revelations how
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:09.720]  it causes all both small and great rich and poor free enslaved to be marked on
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:14.200]  the right hand our forehead so that no one can buy our cell unless he has the
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:18.440]  mark and let you have understanding reckon the number of the beast because
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:24.080]  it's 666 or the number of a man let he was understanding it's a biometric
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:29.360]  handprint or face print it's the number of a man it's a number that calculates a
[01:13:29.360 --> 01:13:34.920]  digital barcode and the barcode biometric system is based in a 666
[01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:41.160]  calculation look it up go ahead sorry oh no no you're right um and I wasn't I
[01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.320]  wasn't trying to I was just saying this kind of calls for you know wisdom look
[01:13:44.320 --> 01:13:47.920]  kind of like let no one who has understanding calculate the number of
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.640]  the beast basically so let he who has understanding calculate the number
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:59.160]  yeah let let our let sorry let the one who has understanding calculate the
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:03.520]  number of the beast that's what I meant I said it backwards I'm sorry my question
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:08.520]  to you though is with do you think that the surround tables that the globalist
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:13.880]  agenda do you think that they kind of use biblically verses like that to carry
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:17.400]  out there in orchestrate they're kind of bullet their sinister well absolutely
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:22.800]  revelation says there's 10 kings 10 regions the UN for 30 years has a 10
[01:14:22.800 --> 01:14:28.680]  region model then 10 sub regions per region the USS 10 FEMA regions they
[01:14:28.680 --> 01:14:34.760]  even built the EU Parliament building in fact we can pull it up the EU
[01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:39.640]  headquarters is a tower of Babel and they said it's supposed to be a tower of
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:45.440]  Babel bringing all together and so yes they believe they are carrying the sound
[01:14:45.440 --> 01:14:49.840]  and the and their internal religion from skull and bones from Bohemian Grove
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.760]  from the books written by the former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt is that
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:59.520]  they believe Lucifer is God and that Jesus is the devil basically and that
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:04.480]  they are waging war against the devil Lucifer is the good guy Jesus is the
[01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:09.280]  devil and yes it is a Luciferian cult who believes that when they kill 90 plus
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:13.280]  percent of the world they will be given immortality through genetic engineering
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:16.520]  now even if you're an atheist and don't believe any of this the point is go
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:21.160]  research what I just said the globalist are actually into this this is what they
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:25.780]  really believe and and so whether it's true or not these psychopaths have the
[01:15:25.780 --> 01:15:31.120]  power and are trying to carry this out and like and it just kind of makes it
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:39.080]  um I mean Bill Hicks once made a joke in reference to like the new the new
[01:15:39.080 --> 01:15:44.440]  addition Bible other new oh sorry I'm saying it it's kind of like how it makes
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:48.760]  it more palatable and desirable to the reader well the problem is is like it
[01:15:48.760 --> 01:15:53.280]  just seems like the people I'm not bashing anyone who reads the Bible what
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:57.240]  I'm saying is the people who read the Bible are kind of it's almost like a way
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:00.360]  of you know wow this is in the Bible this is happening in the Bible yeah I
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:05.040]  appreciate your call what you're saying is is you see it as a self-fulfilling
[01:16:05.040 --> 01:16:12.680]  prophecy Frank Herbert in his book Dune not not the cheesy movie but the book is
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:16.840]  excellent it wrote essays about it saying as a historian and somebody who
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:20.960]  researched history he was codifying things that happened in history through
[01:16:20.960 --> 01:16:25.760]  art types in his book Dune the first books excellent than those that came
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:29.840]  after it he was just profiting they're not very good in my opinion but the
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:35.240]  first one is a masterpiece and in it to planets all over the known Imperial
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:40.240]  Empire this is our humanity in a distant future 5,000 years in the future
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:47.400]  they send the Bene Gesserit witches which are a political religious arm into
[01:16:47.400 --> 01:16:52.800]  every planet as the planets being colonized to set up religious myths and
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:17:04.880]  dogma that a outsider a messianic Mahdi or Messiah is going to come so that if
[01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:08.320]  they ever need to have a rebellion and overthrow who's running that planet at
[01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:11.840]  the time hundreds of years or thousands of years in the future depending on
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:18.040]  which planet they can send in their their operative posing as a cult leader
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:24.920]  who will already have their religious network in place to then basically have
[01:17:24.920 --> 01:17:30.320]  the people go along with it because they see it as revelation and so that's what
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:35.120]  you were trying to say there Jared I could tell where you were going with it
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:41.920]  in your own way so I will say this regardless of how you look at the Bible
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:46.280]  whether you see it as a missionary and protectorate or whether you see it as
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:52.840]  real inspired word of God regardless the globalist are using it they are
[01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:58.040]  setting it up and I've read the Bible all the key areas over and over again and
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:01.280]  let me tell you something it says Christians go through this and the New
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:06.120]  World Order wages war against them it does not say that Jesus is up there on
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:13.360]  board the enterprise with with Scotty beaming people up okay there is no
[01:18:13.360 --> 01:18:19.600]  golden ejection seat or golden lasso it says you go through it and you know what
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:23.000]  people are going to thumbprint and face scan to buy and sell they're going to
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:26.280]  thumbprint and face scan to travel they're going to go through the naked
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:32.080]  body scanners to travel if they buy into this is the end of the world and the
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:34.400]  mainline Christians they believe they're going to be raptured that wasn't
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:37.600]  taught the last 150 years they all believe they're about to be teleported
[01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:40.640]  off the planet so they're like praise God it's happening I'm going to go ahead
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:43.760]  and thumbprint to buy and sell because it's not the mark of the beast it's a
[01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:49.440]  chip on and on and on it's a human number the number of a man if you have
[01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:55.680]  understanding you can reckon it okay it's a biometric number and regardless if
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:18:59.520]  you believe the devil's real or not the point is the globalist are using it as a
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:05.840]  manifesto as a system as a roadmap as a blueprint and if you think they wrote
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:11.680]  this 2,000 years ago to then carry out this plan today or their opportunist
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:17.720]  using this plan but they looked at it 150 years ago here in the US and also in
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:23.160]  England the whole Scofield Bible and they said you know what we had a big
[01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:26.400]  problem with Christians leading the war against King George the Third and
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:29.940]  Christians saying it's our job to confront evil justice be done may the
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:33.720]  heavens fall we're going to go in and teach lay down be passive it's the end
[01:19:33.720 --> 01:19:38.280]  of the world anytime you're faced with corruption go along with it you're
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:43.200]  going to be raptured out and now look at Christians they don't protest abortion
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:49.320]  it's God's will it's almost like a Buddhist or Hindu view well that's just
[01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:52.840]  what you deserve this kid starving on the streets I'm not going to help them
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:59.040]  because it's his karma and so it's almost like a karma thing now just we
[01:19:59.040 --> 01:20:06.240]  just go along with it Alex Jones here with key information the US
[01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:10.200]  government is a Ponzi scheme that relies on the Treasury continuously selling
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:14.280]  large amounts of government bonds to foreign central banks with Japan
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:19.240]  about to become a seller of US bonds in order to rebuild its own nation and the
[01:20:19.240 --> 01:20:23.400]  US antagonizing China by calling them currency manipulators the Federal
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:27.640]  Reserve which is already buying about 70% of US Treasuries will soon be the
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:31.520]  only buyer left of US Treasuries our friends at the National Inflation
[01:20:31.520 --> 01:20:35.080]  Association believe that the US dollar will soon become worthless and

[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:16.560]  by the way we've got a video coming out tonight at presentplanet.tv and on the
[01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:21.080]  YouTube channel where I talk about my disgust for the British royal wedding and
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:25.040]  how everybody's groveling and worshiping it this gives sanctioned to
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.560]  hereditary dictators and what do you think North Korea is they have a third
[01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:32.400]  generation dictator going in there pretty soon he'll start wearing a crown
[01:24:32.400 --> 01:24:38.720]  and a little you know royal purple cape and if they did American women would
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:42.960]  probably fall down and worship them this is how we're taught to love our
[01:24:42.960 --> 01:24:47.160]  servitude and now it's coming out the dictators from all over the Middle East
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:53.160]  and Africa oppressive torturing murderers are traveling to be part of the
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:58.800]  inner circle disgusting wedding of the prince and princess who themselves are
[01:24:58.800 --> 01:25:07.400]  the hereditary progeny of the most oppressive royal thugs in history this
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:11.840]  is diametrically opposed to a free society and every canon of liberty and
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:17.120]  there is now a big debate going on royal wedding guest list includes friends
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:23.240]  family and a few dictators and it goes on from there the king of Bahrain oh
[01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:27.760]  they've been machine gunning folks Kuwait the list goes on and on Swahili
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:32.000]  land let's go ahead and go to Ben in Tennessee been you're on the air hey
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:36.800]  Alex thanks for taking my call a long-time listener first-time caller
[01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:42.240]  this stuff I've seen this article that's been posted on my smart phone and the
[01:25:42.240 --> 01:25:47.600]  news that's coming up today I just have to call in on my smart phone what I
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:54.360]  find so diabolical about the system that's been set up by the globalist this
[01:25:54.360 --> 01:26:01.120]  21st century economy that's been set up is it's basically impossible to be an
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:08.240]  independent self-sufficient you know person in the world of commerce without
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:14.680]  using these devices a spider does what it spins a web designed to do what to
[01:26:14.680 --> 01:26:20.680]  capture you they want us dependent and domesticated and globally with total
[01:26:20.680 --> 01:26:24.880]  continuity of agenda they build this structure it's a world government it's
[01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:29.320]  now out in the open and it's not just to track us to keep us safe it's to track
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:33.640]  us to them be able to raise taxes and no one can escape it so they can basically
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:40.640]  re-engineer society right and and even if people didn't you know know about the
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:46.680]  telecommunications act of 96 they should have seen this coming down the pot with
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.480]  the warrantless wiretapping that the mass media who's now slobbering over this
[01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:57.080]  royal wedding covered back you know almost 10 years ago when the warrantless
[01:26:57.080 --> 01:27:02.720]  wiretap warrantless wiretapping at the news and they should have seen this
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.520]  coming down the pot but at first they lied to you and said there's no warrantless
[01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:11.040]  wiretapping while it was in federal law that the backbone and the
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:15.720]  infrastructure for the wireless wiretapping and the tracking was there
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:21.160]  by law and being used in court cases for at least 10 years all over the country
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:27.680]  exactly and that's even when something is admitted you can't even when they're
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:31.240]  killing the dollar can't get the public to admit it even when they're spying on
[01:27:31.240 --> 01:27:34.840]  you can't get them to admit it and then once they admit it the yuppies go well I
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:41.520]  guess it's good right exactly and that's really all I wanted to say and just keep
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:46.160]  up the good work and and keep up the good fun thanks for everything you thank
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:49.640]  you man man all I can do is raise the alarm I'm a watchman here on the wall

[01:27:53.040 --> 01:27:57.360]  are inside they've bought off the head of the castle and they've bought off the
[01:27:57.360 --> 01:28:06.400]  the castle guards treason is the great curse treason is the plague as Cicero
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:12.040]  said and and they understand the limited individual intellect and over the
[01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:16.160]  horizon understanding and they use that knowing that we're atomized and
[01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:20.560]  basically isolated and they're moving to further isolate us because they're
[01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:24.800]  predators the globalists have dominated the planet they've taken over the planet
[01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:30.200]  they don't need the you we're a bother having to feed us we're a bother having

[01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:54.480]  market watch headline all up on info wars dot com and present by the dot com
[01:36:54.480 --> 01:37:02.120]  drudge also has all up at the top IMF bombshell age of America nears end so I
[01:37:02.120 --> 01:37:07.760]  take you now to dr. Paul Craig Roberts joining us via audio Skype and
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:12.360]  I just went over that news doctor but before we go any further I'd first like
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:19.320]  you to respond to Geithner last week the head of the Treasury your formally
[01:37:19.320 --> 01:37:24.600]  your counterpart you know it basically the same position you were in saying if
[01:37:24.600 --> 01:37:28.240]  you don't give us a higher debt limit if you don't give us more taxes you're
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:33.280]  going to cause the default when that when it's the policies of dollar
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:38.240]  devaluation monetizing debt correct me if I'm wrong sir as a top economist that
[01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:44.080]  is causing the technical default that's what s&p said they said the higher debt
[01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:47.000]  the printing of the money that's what's causing it that's what's causing well
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:51.680]  prices to go up but no Geithner says go into more debt with us showing that
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:55.560]  driving us into this iceberg is their goal dr. Roberts you heard me just
[01:37:55.560 --> 01:38:00.720]  cover that constellation of news what can you tell us about it well I can tell
[01:38:00.720 --> 01:38:08.240]  you lots things about it Alex you know technically Geithner is is right once
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:13.280]  you're trapped with a huge and growing budget deficit that you have to finance
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:18.200]  and there are no takers and you have to print the money you have to have a rise
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:26.600]  the debt ceiling or you do default so technically he's right but so are his
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:32.600]  critics who are right that you can't print money forever because by printing
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:38.600]  the money you are producing the destruction of the dollar so it's a
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:43.320]  situation where both of them are right and the only way you can do something
[01:38:43.320 --> 01:38:48.920]  about it is to cut the federal spending dramatically and in my opinion as I've
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:53.960]  said so many times on your show they can only do that by stopping the wars and
[01:38:53.960 --> 01:38:58.720]  slashing the defense the so-called defense budget the military aggression
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:04.560]  budget and closing the 700 or more bases that they have all over the world in
[01:39:04.560 --> 01:39:10.440]  other words the United States cannot afford its goal of world
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:18.960]  hegemony and that is now what the IMF has made clear the IMF says that in five
[01:39:18.960 --> 01:39:24.920]  years the Chinese economy will have surpassed the American economy I've
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:31.320]  also on your show for a number of years been pointing out that that was exactly
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:37.800]  where we headed because when you all show your jobs in the interest of short-term
[01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:45.000]  profits you are in effect giving up your economy you are taking what was your
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:50.600]  gross domestic product and giving it to the country where you all show the
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:59.280]  jobs as Ralph Gomery put it what we've done is traded jobs for short-term
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:40:06.480]  profits the jobs have moved to China this capability then to produce the roads
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:13.000]  in the United States it grows in China and this is why we are becoming more
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:21.560]  and more polarized between a very small very rich class and and growing poverty
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:26.080]  everywhere else the erosion of the middle class because the people who get the
[01:40:26.080 --> 01:40:32.200]  profits are very different from the people who lost the wages when the
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:38.200]  jobs were moved offshore so the corporations driven by Wall Street
[01:40:38.200 --> 01:40:44.640]  have essentially destroyed the American economy and that is now no longer a
[01:40:44.640 --> 01:40:50.800]  secret the IMF itself and which surprised me because the IMF in my
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:56.840]  opinion which may be mistaken has always been an agent of American policy
[01:40:56.840 --> 01:41:07.520]  and yet here they are telling the truth now I'll say one other thing I think
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:15.040]  this puts the Libyan situation in the right perspective because the United
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:22.040]  States realizing finally that it is being surpassed by China that is the
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:27.560]  guys in Washington are now trying to deny the Chinese resources of the way
[01:41:27.560 --> 01:41:34.080]  the United States and Britain did to Japan in the 1930s thus creating World
[01:41:34.080 --> 01:41:42.640]  War II in the Pacific so what the Libya thing is about is canceling out China's
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:49.840]  economic penetration of Africa canceling out China's massive energy investments
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:56.760]  in eastern Libya by overthrowing the regime and thereby eliminating China
[01:41:56.760 --> 01:42:04.720]  from the Mediterranean so you can see the same sort of power play that
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:10.560]  backfired against the Japanese and resulted in Pearl Harbor now being
[01:42:10.560 --> 01:42:16.800]  employed against the Chinese in Libya and it will also be used against the
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:24.800]  Chinese and Angola and Nigeria or they also have energy investments and this
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:31.080]  also puts Syria in perspective because the Russians have a massive naval base
[01:42:31.080 --> 01:42:37.280]  in Syria that they are in the process of renovating and are going to keep very
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:43.840]  large warships there including aircraft carriers and so it becomes imperative to
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:50.040]  overthrow the Syrian regime in order to get Russia out of the Mediterranean as
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:59.040]  well so I see all of this leading to a massive war you see all of this leading
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:06.600]  towards the first great war of the 21st century as Gerald Salenty says right now
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:11.200]  going back and then we'll expand into the geopolitical realm that you just got
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:15.360]  into going back to Geithner though my issue of him being deceptive is he
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:19.880]  expanded saying basically keep the policies we've got in place of the
[01:43:19.880 --> 01:43:26.880]  spending of the bureaucracy raise the taxes and that that would basically fix
[01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:32.960]  the problem when they know full well that's what's caused the problem and
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:38.040]  that they do not want the type of cuts to be made that are needed and so
[01:43:38.040 --> 01:43:43.360]  clearly the private shareholders of the Federal Reserve want to vertically
[01:43:43.360 --> 01:43:47.320]  consolidate the economy you look at the general electrics and others paying
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:53.200]  almost no you know tax because they position themselves this is the classic
[01:43:53.200 --> 01:43:57.480]  game like they use in Mexico or in other third-world countries where the wealthy
[01:43:57.480 --> 01:44:04.400]  use economic deprivation as a political tool to suppress the system wants a
[01:44:04.400 --> 01:44:09.080]  post-industrial world that's been stated by the UN that's Goldman Sachs pays all
[01:44:09.080 --> 01:44:13.560]  this money to promote the carbon taxes I mean they want this system where the
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:20.120]  crony non-free market fascist capitalist if you can call them that are waging
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:24.040]  war against the free market and of course examples of that dr. Roberts are
[01:44:24.040 --> 01:44:29.680]  Obama supporters they get waivers to not have to buy the health care or Obama
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:35.240]  supporters get to be on the economic council and and not pay taxes I mean
[01:44:35.240 --> 01:44:41.520]  this this is really a criminal looting and my point is they consciously know
[01:44:41.520 --> 01:44:45.360]  what they're doing they've consciously put the derivatives in place gutted the
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:49.840]  economy moved the jobs overseas with companies they control and dominate
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:54.720]  position the police state ahead of the social unrest I mean you've talked a
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:59.160]  lot about how they're just madmen and out of control I see total precision in
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:04.880]  what they've set up and deployed well I know you do Alex and that's where we
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:10.680]  don't agree because they don't have they don't have anything to gain by
[01:45:10.680 --> 01:45:16.800]  destroying their own economic base I see it differently they are ever since the
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:20.520]  Clinton administration Wall Street has become more and more powerful I mean we
[01:45:20.520 --> 01:45:24.760]  had a lot of trouble with them in the Reagan administration but they weren't
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:29.440]  able to dominate but now they do you know ever since the Clinton administration
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:35.160]  Goldman Sachs has run the Treasury and they run the Fed and the New York Fed
[01:45:35.160 --> 01:45:40.840]  and they they are very short-term in their outlook and their short-term
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:46.560]  outlook is this quarter's profits next quarter's profits because those things
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:50.560]  determine the huge bonuses that are making them all richer and richer and
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:55.040]  richer and that's their perspective they have they have nothing to gain
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:02.240]  from destroying their the economic base but the consequence of their short run
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:10.960]  view as Garmary says is to trade jobs for profit at the expense of the economic
[01:46:10.960 --> 01:46:16.960]  capability of the economy so you can you can say well they won't care because
[01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:23.280]  they'll all be mega billionaires and we'll have put the money into some other
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:28.920]  currency or the gold or into foreign assets or something but but the reason
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:35.720]  they're doing it is just simply short-term profits greed the deregulation
[01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:40.200]  that enabled them also began in the Clinton administration last stagled
[01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:48.800]  that was that was a very important part of it yes but so was the when they blocked
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:56.400]  the commodity futures trading corporation from regulating derivatives you
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:47:02.520]  know that was a green span and Larry Summers and I think Ruben they blocked
[01:47:02.520 --> 01:47:08.520]  the regulation of derivatives they also took off the position limits on
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:12.920]  speculators that's right now they can do unlimited naked shorts and manipulate
[01:47:12.920 --> 01:47:21.120]  the markets and that's right so all of this doesn't it's a it's a form of
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:29.360]  suicide for them as well because in the end there's nothing and certainly when
[01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:39.000]  we we see a situation with IMF says that the age of America is nearing it in
[01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:46.320]  that means the dollar's role as reserve currency is nearing its end and that
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:54.960]  means they won't be able to finance the deficit even by monetizing it so we're
[01:47:54.960 --> 01:48:03.400]  reaching we're running out of time and as long as war is so important to them
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:09.560]  for the profits of the military security complex and the neoconservative
[01:48:09.560 --> 01:48:16.520]  etiology of American world-age enemy sure as long as you have that driving the
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:20.720]  war is they cannot get the budget under control all right dr. Roberts I want to
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:23.600]  speak to that and they get back in the geopolitical that you were mentioning
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:30.440]  earlier but but I think there's a paradox here only in semantics yes it's
[01:48:30.440 --> 01:48:36.200]  greed yes it's avarice yes it's hutzpah bravada whatever you want to call it the
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:41.640]  point is the end result is going to be the same my point is is that with
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:46.560]  megalomania with Hitler turning east against the Russians Napoleon doing the
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:51.520]  same thing we know that these people get so confident the only thing that stays
[01:48:51.520 --> 01:48:57.600]  the same you know in history is the arrogance of elites and we're seeing
[01:48:57.600 --> 01:49:01.960]  that again but regardless that they believe they have a strategy and a
[01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:07.360]  deceptive stratagem to get away with this and as ran corporation said two
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:12.480]  years ago it is a wider war along the order of World War two size is what
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:17.080]  they called for to get Americans so desperate in a depression stage terror
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:22.360]  attacks whatever's needed and then launch huge regional wars that then do
[01:49:22.360 --> 01:49:27.720]  escalate and so my point is is is that Wall Street was green-lighted to do
[01:49:27.720 --> 01:49:33.880]  this because there was a larger plan like Rothschild in in in 1815 you know
[01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:38.840]  knowing that Napoleon had lost getting his runners back across the channel in
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:43.600]  those Corvettes and getting back over and saying the British had lost he buys
[01:49:43.600 --> 01:49:48.120]  up the market and takes over the British Empire if we look at this as the
[01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:51.760]  American government doesn't know what it's doing I tend to agree with you but
[01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:59.280]  the Wall Street brains in there they fully know what they're doing well I
[01:49:59.280 --> 01:50:06.840]  don't think they do because they have no way to pay for these wars and the
[01:50:06.840 --> 01:50:15.360]  deficit is already can't be financed and we've had a whole range of foreign
[01:50:15.360 --> 01:50:20.800]  currencies including even the Russian ruble making new highs repeatedly
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:26.920]  against the dollar for the last four months new highs and gold and silver
[01:50:26.920 --> 01:50:33.840]  you cannot finance all these wars when you already have one and a half trillion
[01:50:33.840 --> 01:50:41.960]  dollar annual deficits that you already printing money to cover and so there's
[01:50:41.960 --> 01:50:48.800]  no way out of this except failure collapse well let's break down then sure
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:53.000]  I understand let's break that down we come back Dr. Roberts as a top economist
[01:50:53.000 --> 01:50:57.520]  how you see this going from bad to worse as you said no way out we'll be right
[01:50:57.520 --> 01:50:59.800]  back
[01:51:00.200 --> 01:51:04.680]  hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non

[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:12.240]  in a real meltdown non hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or
[01:51:12.240 --> 01:51:15.640]  gold it's true seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this
[01:51:15.640 --> 01:51:19.440]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends and

[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:23.360]  no way out it runs from bad to worst I feel like we should be you know playing
[01:54:23.360 --> 01:54:28.780]  some type of funeral pyre procession music for the Republic for America
[01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:34.100]  maneuvered into this dr. Roberts and if you've got to go I understand I'll keep
[01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:36.620]  you five minutes to the next hour than Wayne Madsen's coming in so we at least
[01:54:36.620 --> 01:54:40.700]  have two short segments to break this down the technicals of what's happened
[01:54:40.700 --> 01:54:44.900]  the dollar the move towards the exits accelerating what will it mean as the
[01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:50.540]  dollar begins to dies the world reserve currency and is there any way out of this
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:54.060]  I mean obviously the policy makers are full steam ahead but is there any way
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:55:00.700]  out well I'm not giving the arrogance in their hubris as you so aptly describe
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:06.980]  them theoretically they're away there's a way out you would have to stop the
[01:55:06.980 --> 01:55:13.140]  wars got the defense budget close the basis and you would also have to change
[01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:17.260]  the way you tax corporations I've explained this before on your show they
[01:55:17.260 --> 01:55:22.340]  would have to tax corporations according to where the value is added to their
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:26.860]  products so that if they are producing offshore for American markets they would
[01:55:26.860 --> 01:55:31.220]  have an extremely high tax rate but if they produce at home with the American
[01:55:31.220 --> 01:55:35.380]  labor force for American markets they would have a low tax rate that would
[01:55:35.380 --> 01:55:43.060]  negate the advantage of the low labor cost now what's also going to negate
[01:55:43.060 --> 01:55:50.320]  that advantage is when the Chinese finally give up the currency peg to the
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:55.060]  dollar because that's really what protects the dollar it's the currency
[01:55:55.060 --> 01:56:01.860]  peg that China does the day the China gives that up and the their currency
[01:56:01.860 --> 01:56:09.220]  rises dramatically against the dollar then that will also show the world that
[01:56:09.220 --> 01:56:15.220]  the dollar is not the reserve currency that it's weak and getting weaker and
[01:56:15.220 --> 01:56:22.100]  the day the Chinese decide to put pressure on Washington by by you're
[01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:28.260]  threatening to sell their huge holding dollar holdings that also will show that
[01:56:28.260 --> 01:56:32.700]  there's not really the superpower role anymore that its creditors have more
[01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:40.140]  power than it does because of its very poor economic position so things things
[01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:48.300]  can happen and things could happen but the hubris will prevail in my opinion I
[01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:54.260]  think something else could happen shortly the Federal Reserve could announce
[01:56:54.260 --> 01:57:01.700]  that okay we'll have no quantitative easing three and then given the idiots
[01:57:01.700 --> 01:57:06.060]  in the market so it also oh great they're not gonna buy any more bonds
[01:57:06.060 --> 01:57:10.020]  print any more dollars to the dollar it's going to be strong again and that
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:16.340]  could cause the gold and silver markets to collapse temporarily because they
[01:57:16.340 --> 01:57:21.860]  obviously have to continue quantitative easing as there's no other way to
[01:57:21.860 --> 01:57:30.020]  finance the deficit as they're making no cuts in the in the spending in fact the
[01:57:30.020 --> 01:57:37.500]  places they identify for cuts like Medicare Social Security this would
[01:57:37.500 --> 01:57:43.460]  simply impoverish the population further and the further strength consumer
[01:57:43.460 --> 01:57:50.180]  demand and produce yet larger budget deficits that would have to be financed
[01:57:50.180 --> 01:57:55.820]  by printing more money so they're in an impossible situation is the austerity
[01:57:55.820 --> 01:58:00.820]  trap and then if we lose the triple a rating the debt cost even more and the
[01:58:00.820 --> 01:58:06.500]  interest rates go up of course right and and the triple a rating is a hoax
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:14.860]  already it's the reason that the government can survive is that it still
[01:58:14.860 --> 01:58:20.700]  has the dollars reserve currency and it can pay its bills by printing its own
[01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:26.460]  money that's a very difficult thing for most countries in the world to do they
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:32.740]  simply can't do that and so when they destroy the dollar which is what they're
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:36.260]  doing is happening every week stay there do five more minutes with us
[01:58:36.260 --> 01:58:50.860]  describe what happens when they kill the dollar how you see that death happen a
[01:58:50.860 --> 01:58:55.780]  very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most
[01:58:55.780 --> 01:59:00.500]  important day in America in more than 50 years he says it will change everything
[01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:04.700]  about our lives the way you shop travel invest educate your children and even
[01:59:04.700 --> 01:59:08.060]  how you take care of your health and your own family now this man has made some
[01:59:08.060 --> 01:59:12.340]  outrageous predictions over the years the crazy part is he's usually right you
[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:16.300]  see he predicted the collapse of GM panty may Freddie Mac and America's
[01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:20.180]  biggest mall owner general growth properties in fact Barron's called his
[01:59:20.180 --> 01:59:24.620]  work a dire prophecy recently he created a video which you can watch online for
[01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:28.020]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a
[01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:31.940]  real eye-opener I can't stress this enough you should at least watch this
[01:59:31.940 --> 01:59:35.340]  free video online today he explains everything you need to know including

[01:59:52.180 --> 02:00:06.420]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[02:00:06.420 --> 02:00:13.740]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:21.940]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:21.940 --> 02:00:31.900]  all right dr. Paul Craig Roberts with us for another five minutes okay mr.
[02:00:31.900 --> 02:00:38.620]  Roberts you were getting into when the dollar dies does it die a slow death or
[02:00:38.620 --> 02:00:41.500]  does it die with a bang I mean it's already dying slowly but then like an
[02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:45.820]  old horse with his legs broken you know at some point does somebody put a
[02:00:45.820 --> 02:00:49.220]  bullet in its head because the Chinese are actually in the news today talking
[02:00:49.220 --> 02:00:57.100]  about massively decreasing how many treasury bills they buy yes it's dying
[02:00:57.100 --> 02:01:03.100]  slowly and but when when the final death comes it'll probably be very quickly
[02:01:03.100 --> 02:01:11.100]  and in very severe and what Americans will experience will be an amazing jump
[02:01:11.100 --> 02:01:16.180]  in the rate measured rate of inflation and they'll go into Walmart as I've
[02:01:16.180 --> 02:01:23.020]  said before and they'll think they're new and Neiman Marcus because today so much
[02:01:23.020 --> 02:01:30.220]  of the goods that the Americans buy are made off-shore and their prices low
[02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:37.460]  because of the Chinese peg to the dollar and so once that comes unglued the
[02:01:37.460 --> 02:01:44.300]  prices will be very high in fact Walmart announced the CEO announced a week or
[02:01:44.300 --> 02:01:51.300]  two ago that because of the dollars declined so far
[02:01:51.300 --> 02:01:56.580]  Walmart's customers were going to experience serious price rises that
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:02:03.620]  they had held the prices down as much as they could but that the collapse of the
[02:02:03.620 --> 02:02:08.480]  dollars value was forcing them into price rises and that and that they
[02:02:08.480 --> 02:02:13.500]  would not be able to award these so that'll start happening more and more and
[02:02:13.500 --> 02:02:19.860]  become faster and more furious so by the way McDonald's came out over the
[02:02:19.860 --> 02:02:25.660]  weekend and said inflation is going to make their food go up well you know the
[02:02:25.660 --> 02:02:32.500]  World Bank released a report recently that wheat prices are more than doubled
[02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:40.740]  between June of 2010 and January of this year corn prices have gone up more
[02:02:40.740 --> 02:02:46.540]  than 70% and that this is producing massive hunger and starvation elsewhere
[02:02:46.540 --> 02:02:51.100]  in the world and this of course is because all these things are priced in
[02:02:51.100 --> 02:02:55.060]  dollars and the Federal Reserve is destroying the dollar the budget
[02:02:55.060 --> 02:02:59.020]  deficits destroying the dollar the offshoring of jobs destroying the dollar
[02:02:59.020 --> 02:03:07.260]  and so the cost is being delivered to the entire world there there are now
[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:14.340]  tens or millions of people now are starving and we knew I mean it's
[02:03:14.340 --> 02:03:19.740]  common sense that this QE2 would do this and they said oh that's ridiculous and
[02:03:19.740 --> 02:03:23.380]  now it's here and finally the mainstream media is admitting hey your oil prices
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:28.500]  are up not just because of speculators they always blame but mainly because of
[02:03:28.500 --> 02:03:32.180]  dollar devaluation how are they going to handle this politically I guess you
[02:03:32.180 --> 02:03:38.900]  answer the question start a new war well I I think they'll be forced into a war
[02:03:38.900 --> 02:03:42.900]  because they won't the Washington won't be able to accept that it's been
[02:03:42.900 --> 02:03:48.700]  dethroned by its own folly and stupidity and when the rest of the world
[02:03:48.700 --> 02:03:53.060]  starts pushing back they'll still think they're tough guys and that we're a
[02:03:53.060 --> 02:03:59.900]  superpower and so I think that we may be faced with a nuclear war and and just the
[02:03:59.900 --> 02:04:05.780]  end of everything I mean this is how it's likely to end given the fact that
[02:04:05.780 --> 02:04:14.500]  the people in Washington are incompetent crazed inhumane they have no
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:20.540]  redeeming virtues and they and they're playing God with the world well and
[02:04:20.540 --> 02:04:27.140]  that's what's going on I mean the danger of a of a nuclear war is huge
[02:04:27.140 --> 02:04:32.220]  because just as a Japanese doctor I got to stop you right there you know I don't
[02:04:32.220 --> 02:04:35.860]  mean to keep you more because I've got another guest coming in but this is
[02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:39.500]  cliffhanger you start talking about the danger of nuclear war and you're a
[02:04:39.500 --> 02:04:44.380]  very conservative focused respectist you know listed as what top in the top 10
[02:04:44.380 --> 02:04:47.580]  economists in the world will you come back and spend four or five minutes
[02:04:47.580 --> 02:04:51.620]  breaking down the geopolitical front and how this can lead to nuclear war can

[02:07:06.420 --> 02:07:10.380]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new
[02:07:10.380 --> 02:07:14.300]  energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[02:07:14.300 --> 02:07:18.540]  to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:22.980]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[02:07:22.980 --> 02:07:27.700]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:07:27.700 --> 02:07:31.500]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:07:31.500 --> 02:07:35.140]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:39.500]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:08:11.100 --> 02:08:13.940]  radio network
[02:08:14.540 --> 02:08:18.980]  all right riding shotgun with us for the rest of the hour here in studio is Wayne

[02:08:28.780 --> 02:08:33.220]  documentary but we've been talking to Dr. Paul Craig Roberts and he was going
[02:08:33.220 --> 02:08:38.420]  to be gone at the end of the last hour but he just brought up his prognosis that
[02:08:38.420 --> 02:08:43.820]  the hubris and the runaway train that is the American Empire if you study
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:48.860]  history with Hitler or Mussolini or countless others they will start wars
[02:08:48.860 --> 02:08:52.860]  and actually that's what the Rand Corporation and others say is what's
[02:08:52.860 --> 02:08:57.420]  needed to get the globalist out of this crisis you know they're attempting to
[02:08:57.420 --> 02:09:02.060]  get total power out of their power grab but in the process they're destroying
[02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:06.380]  the dollar that has been the source of their global hegemony so in just a few
[02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:09.660]  minutes Dr. Roberts will let you go former head of policy department of
[02:09:09.660 --> 02:09:14.220]  Treasury best-selling author syndicate of columnist coming out with a bold
[02:09:14.220 --> 02:09:18.140]  statement like that that you believe this will probably lead towards major war
[02:09:18.140 --> 02:09:23.780]  and perhaps nuclear war break down the technicals of that geopolitical statement
[02:09:23.780 --> 02:09:28.460]  well Alex it's hard to do in such a short time but look at it this way what's
[02:09:28.460 --> 02:09:31.740]  what are the guys in Washington what have they done they've destroyed the
[02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:37.940]  economy they've destroyed the currency they've destroyed people's incomes in
[02:09:37.940 --> 02:09:42.060]  the first decade of the 21st century they had two massive stock market
[02:09:42.060 --> 02:09:48.780]  collapses which from which retirees have never recovered their assets they
[02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:54.020]  they destroyed with a bubble they bid up real estate prices and then they've
[02:09:54.020 --> 02:10:00.300]  destroyed real estate market there's a massive wipeout of people's ability to
[02:10:00.300 --> 02:10:06.220]  look after themselves at home and the the government is overcommitted
[02:10:06.220 --> 02:10:10.380]  militarily abroad we've got six wars going either
[02:10:10.380 --> 02:10:16.260]  involving our troops or proxies or drones or airstrikes these all very
[02:10:16.260 --> 02:10:21.900]  expensive the none of them are affordable and they're trying now to deny
[02:10:21.900 --> 02:10:27.580]  China resources that's what Libya is all about they're they're threatening
[02:10:27.580 --> 02:10:32.220]  Russia's national security that's what Syria is all about the big Russian
[02:10:32.220 --> 02:10:35.860]  naval base that's what 888 was about when they launched the attack on the
[02:10:35.860 --> 02:10:45.660]  Georgian areas exactly and so here you have a weak declining country becoming
[02:10:45.660 --> 02:10:51.380]  more and more aggressive toward China a very strong rising country and toward
[02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:57.540]  Russia which has an unlimited supply of nuclear weapons so how much you will
[02:10:57.540 --> 02:11:04.780]  China and Russia tolerate I mean at some point given the hubris and the lack of
[02:11:04.780 --> 02:11:11.900]  judgment in Washington they're gonna cross the line and they're gonna push
[02:11:11.900 --> 02:11:18.620]  too hard and there's gonna be a response and it's very easy for things
[02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:24.020]  to escalate particularly when your own rulers are crazed I mean there's nobody
[02:11:24.020 --> 02:11:29.300]  in Washington that's saying is there I mean what you you show every day the
[02:11:29.300 --> 02:11:35.900]  absurd statements the insane behavior the lack of concern not just for
[02:11:35.900 --> 02:11:41.220]  American people but for people anywhere there's no concern in Washington for
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:44.940]  people in closing let me ask you that I mean they've got the TSA coming out as a
[02:11:44.940 --> 02:11:48.860]  domestic police force they now admit that they've been surveilling everybody
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:52.980]  without wiretaps totally illegal the TSA sticking their hands down people's
[02:11:52.980 --> 02:11:58.020]  pants just 20 years ago they wouldn't let troops use DU now they use it at
[02:11:58.020 --> 02:12:05.140]  shooting ranges at National Guard bases destroying the water table they there's
[02:12:05.140 --> 02:12:10.340]  no safety standards now I mean it is really just a hubris driven insanity
[02:12:10.340 --> 02:12:16.700]  they delusionally think they have a plan but across the board take Bloomberg
[02:12:16.700 --> 02:12:21.700]  last year reporting that 11 years ago they signed secret deals the VA did to
[02:12:21.700 --> 02:12:26.140]  take the death benefits from World War 2 vets through current vets I mean this
[02:12:26.140 --> 02:12:31.660]  is criminality so naked it's almost like when psychopaths in criminology have
[02:12:31.660 --> 02:12:36.220]  killed 15 20 people and they start getting more reckless almost like they
[02:12:36.220 --> 02:12:41.420]  want to get caught your closing comments on that well what hasn't the
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:45.500]  government destroyed they've even destroyed our civil liberties we now
[02:12:45.500 --> 02:12:50.860]  have an executive that is the president who's not accountable to law as long as
[02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:59.580]  he can be at war so you know in there's no democracy is as an oligarchy is five
[02:12:59.580 --> 02:13:05.740]  or six very powerful oligarchic interests that essentially rule so
[02:13:05.740 --> 02:13:11.580]  everything's destroyed this it's not just the economy and so you're right you're
[02:13:11.580 --> 02:13:17.740]  absolutely right and sooner or later the people will be alienated from the
[02:13:17.740 --> 02:13:23.020]  government I don't know how long people look we have we have a worse
[02:13:23.020 --> 02:13:30.220]  situation than big brother in George Orwell's book 1984 than those people
[02:13:30.220 --> 02:13:34.940]  living under we were dominated by propaganda by lies but unaccountable
[02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:41.140]  government elections are pointless nothing ever changes the political system
[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:44.980]  is essentially impotent and that has fed their hubris to the point of like a
[02:13:44.980 --> 02:13:48.820]  snake eating its tail they're now even destroying themselves and in closing
[02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:53.140]  remember that quote of Carl Rove's the New York Times reporter at a cocktail
[02:13:53.140 --> 02:13:56.380]  party in front of a Washington Post reporter and then the reporters going
[02:13:56.380 --> 02:14:00.020]  to come on you know your line about WMD's you know I mean this is becoming
[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:05.060]  delusional and Rove said you don't get it we're history's actors now of course
[02:14:05.060 --> 02:14:08.820]  we're not following reality you guys are what we call the reality based
[02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:14.220]  community but we control reality so we'll change reality day to day and then
[02:14:14.220 --> 02:14:19.260]  you will report on that new reality dutifully there is the statement that
[02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:24.700]  shows that they believe because they have the power that they have the power
[02:14:24.700 --> 02:14:29.340]  to do anything and it reminds me of Hitler and his bunker directing armies
[02:14:29.340 --> 02:14:35.100]  that didn't exist you're right Alex except we're all going to pay the price
[02:14:35.100 --> 02:14:40.860]  for this handful of fools they're destroying all of us and people all
[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:48.220]  over the world are being destroyed and so you know when is the dollar die we'll
[02:14:48.220 --> 02:14:52.820]  let you go we appreciate your time when is the dollar die it's dying now it's
[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:58.460]  dying right now it's been dying for months for years actually but if you look
[02:14:58.460 --> 02:15:02.060]  at the number of other currencies that have made new highs against the dollar
[02:15:02.060 --> 02:15:08.420]  the last four months look even the euro is making new highs and the euro despite
[02:15:08.420 --> 02:15:14.140]  the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and all the countries that are allegedly
[02:15:14.140 --> 02:15:17.860]  bankrupt so it's like a cancer patient has been sick for a while but now the
[02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:22.340]  patients having trouble breathing that's about it yeah all right dr. Roberts
[02:15:22.340 --> 02:15:26.620]  you've been right all along and history will know that you told the truth and
[02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:30.340]  stood up for what was right I hope that people in government the general public
[02:15:30.340 --> 02:15:33.580]  listening realize that it's not enough for you and I to be here telling the
[02:15:33.580 --> 02:15:37.460]  truth they've got to get this information out to everybody I am seeing
[02:15:37.460 --> 02:15:42.460]  some positive signs in neocontok radio they're now more and more you know
[02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:46.660]  saying both parties are bad and that you know inside interest in Wall Street or
[02:15:46.660 --> 02:15:50.540]  greedy and wrecking everything because I think a lot of mainline people who
[02:15:50.540 --> 02:15:53.380]  thought they were part of the establishment are beginning to realize
[02:15:53.380 --> 02:15:57.320]  that that their their necks are on the chopping block as well maybe self
[02:15:57.320 --> 02:16:03.580]  preservation we'll get some of these yuppies out of their la la land well
[02:16:03.580 --> 02:16:08.380]  we can hope so all right sir your book is how the economy was lost the war of
[02:16:08.380 --> 02:16:12.220]  the worlds available at better bookstores on amazon.com dr. Roberts
[02:16:12.220 --> 02:16:17.300]  thanks for the time pleased to be with you Alex thank you sir there he goes it's
[02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:21.220]  like going to visit the doctor and we have all these top economists and Nobel
[02:16:21.220 --> 02:16:26.060]  Prize winners on and you name it they all tell you the same thing and Obama says
[02:16:26.060 --> 02:16:28.980]  everything's great the economy's wonderful everything's fine the
[02:16:28.980 --> 02:16:32.900]  Republicans will not tell you it's the Federal Reserve except for Ron Paul and
[02:16:32.900 --> 02:16:36.580]  Rand Paul they will not tell you it's a debt black hole impossible to get out of
[02:16:36.580 --> 02:16:41.260]  designed to do this to us and Robert's point is it's so destructive even though
[02:16:41.260 --> 02:16:45.260]  it gave the bankers incredible power what are they going to spend the money on
[02:16:45.260 --> 02:16:49.980]  when everything's like Zimbabwe if we have a great depression like we had in
[02:16:49.980 --> 02:16:54.540]  the 20s and 30s it will be road warrior and here's the deal the economic
[02:16:54.540 --> 02:16:59.700]  atmosphere the economic climate we're in is much worse than leading up to 29
[02:16:59.700 --> 02:17:03.500]  okay and I'm trying to scare you we're gonna do some overdrive a little bit in
[02:17:03.500 --> 02:17:07.620]  the next hour because while he's here I won't spend as much time with him as
[02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:11.900]  possible and also while we're at it live on air let's look at the schedule when
[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:15.020]  can we get Wayne back in here for a full hour tomorrow when I heard that Wayne
[02:17:15.020 --> 02:17:19.740]  Madsen was going to be leaving the United States because of the a foreign
[02:17:19.740 --> 02:17:26.100]  embassy a major media outlet and a confirmation through the source of the
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:33.140]  U.S. Embassy that that the White House wants him dead and Wayne of course
[02:17:33.140 --> 02:17:37.020]  formerly with the NSA syndicated columnist very well respected written
[02:17:37.020 --> 02:17:39.780]  some of the biggest publications in the country when he brings something out
[02:17:39.780 --> 02:17:43.540]  like that we certainly respected he of course one of the guys meeting with the
[02:17:43.540 --> 02:17:47.940]  DC madam and helped get her on the show right before she was
[02:17:47.940 --> 02:17:52.860]  suicided Arkans cited and so Wayne is here with us today and tomorrow before
[02:17:52.860 --> 02:17:58.620]  he gets ready to leave the United States to work on his magnum opus exposing the
[02:17:58.620 --> 02:18:04.660]  CIA ties of Barack Obama Wayne Madsen report calm Wayne great to have you
[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:09.620]  here with us today got to be with you here in Austin Alex we're we're we're
[02:18:09.620 --> 02:18:13.060]  honored to have you we're going to break here in a moment and I want to get into
[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:16.740]  your research on the CIA and birth certificate issues that are really
[02:18:16.740 --> 02:18:20.820]  heating up but Dr. Paul Craig Roberts was talking about the fact that the dollar
[02:18:20.820 --> 02:18:25.260]  is doomed and that the elites running things are crazy you've lived in DC for
[02:18:25.260 --> 02:18:29.420]  decades I mean is there a method to their madness or has it gone to just pure
[02:18:29.420 --> 02:18:34.660]  hubris I think we haven't seen anything like this before in DC because even the
[02:18:34.660 --> 02:18:38.220]  word coming out of the Treasury Department I'm not talking about the
[02:18:38.220 --> 02:18:42.660]  senior officials but those those people that work in the bowels of the place is
[02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:48.700]  not encouraging and you hear the same thing in Congress and the news out that
[02:18:48.700 --> 02:18:55.180]  the US economy will be eclipsed by China in 2016 I think it's it's clearly the
[02:18:55.180 --> 02:18:59.540]  writing is on the wall what's going to happen to us and our economy it's
[02:18:59.540 --> 02:19:04.020]  happening right now of course to listen to Obama things we've had two fed heads
[02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:09.500]  Kansas City and Dallas say we are completely screwed all right and then
[02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:12.860]  this and they've said the Fed is doing it yeah I mean I've never seen a
[02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:16.620]  rebellion in the Fed like that right right so you know even the even they're
[02:19:16.620 --> 02:19:19.460]  eating their own dead here now well they wouldn't do that unless they knew it was
[02:19:19.460 --> 02:19:23.380]  dire right and and the word has been coming out of Treasury for a couple of
[02:19:23.380 --> 02:19:27.100]  years now about where this economy is heading and where the dollar is heading
[02:19:27.100 --> 02:19:30.540]  I mean is it like the Russians before their collapse where they're just
[02:19:30.540 --> 02:19:35.660]  illusion well when you see this push now remember what happened to Russia after
[02:19:35.660 --> 02:19:39.940]  the fall of Soviet Union they privatized all those state owned industries and now
[02:19:39.940 --> 02:19:43.980]  we see this push to do this in the various state let's talk about the method
[02:19:43.980 --> 02:19:47.260]  of the madness because I agree with your analysis I mean that it is wild what
[02:19:47.260 --> 02:19:49.540]  they're doing but they've they've planned this just like we're a third world
[02:19:49.540 --> 02:19:52.740]  country Wayne stay there break down what they did in the Soviet Union when it
[02:19:52.740 --> 02:19:55.700]  collapsed what they're gonna do here and by the way if you're in the middle class
[02:19:55.700 --> 02:20:01.820]  that means you make more than $50,000 a year they're gonna rob you hi this is
[02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:05.740]  Alex Jones did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds
[02:20:05.740 --> 02:20:09.260]  and secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real
[02:20:09.260 --> 02:20:13.300]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[02:20:13.300 --> 02:20:16.420]  true seeds that all perform even gold and silver before in this country and
[02:20:16.420 --> 02:20:20.220]  it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from

[02:21:10.220 --> 02:21:14.300]  hyperinflation that will soon hit the United States and could lead to millions
[02:21:14.300 --> 02:21:18.540]  of Americans becoming homeless all caused by the devalued US dollar while

[02:22:29.780 --> 02:22:33.340]  hi this is Ted Anderson have you ever wondered why banks stockbrokers
[02:22:33.340 --> 02:22:37.020]  investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs they've been available since

[02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:29.420]  wait Manson there's too much confusion my friend but you know for those that
[02:24:29.420 --> 02:24:32.700]  research this information there's really not confusion there's just the
[02:24:32.700 --> 02:24:37.300]  fuddled amazement at what the system is doing and how crazy they are now you
[02:24:37.300 --> 02:24:41.100]  were getting into the parallel between the collapse of the Soviet system and
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:44.820]  the robber barons the oligarchs coming in and what's being set up and planned
[02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:49.140]  here the solution by the Republicans is a form of austerity that doesn't fix the
[02:24:49.140 --> 02:24:55.300]  Federal Reserve root of it it just simply privatizes the system break that
[02:24:55.300 --> 02:24:59.940]  down well if you look across the country what's happening we see further
[02:24:59.940 --> 02:25:04.820]  privatization of turnpikes for example going to private companies to collect
[02:25:04.820 --> 02:25:10.340]  tolls everyone should always be worried when a cash intensive operation is
[02:25:10.340 --> 02:25:14.060]  privatized it's a recipe for money laundering on a grand scale well they
[02:25:14.060 --> 02:25:17.700]  beef the prices they lobby to not fix the other roads they take over existing
[02:25:17.700 --> 02:25:22.580]  roads right the roads we see the now with privatization possibly a public
[02:25:22.580 --> 02:25:27.300]  lands both state-owned forest state-owned parks that it goes on and the old
[02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:29.940]  timers said that in the mid 90s was going to happen for collateral on the
[02:25:29.940 --> 02:25:33.700]  debt now they admit just like we're third world country that's happening so
[02:25:33.700 --> 02:25:37.580]  we're you know what's what's going to happen next we're going to see corporate
[02:25:37.580 --> 02:25:42.100]  sponsorship like all these sports arenas of you know federal monuments
[02:25:42.100 --> 02:25:48.380]  sponsored by various oil companies and banks and what have you that may be
[02:25:48.380 --> 02:25:52.260]  around the corner well it's like the 600 plus Greek islands one big broker they
[02:25:52.260 --> 02:25:56.020]  owed three billion to through fraud he said I'll just take that famous island
[02:25:56.020 --> 02:25:59.460]  and they transferred it to him directly right well they might maybe they'll
[02:25:59.460 --> 02:26:04.620]  grab Hawaii or something here soon and just put it up on the auction block but
[02:26:04.620 --> 02:26:08.780]  I think I think this just goes to show that the people were benefiting from
[02:26:08.780 --> 02:26:12.420]  this I meant I should have also mentioned what's happening in public education
[02:26:12.420 --> 02:26:16.340]  you got the Washington Post 70% of their businesses from a private education
[02:26:16.340 --> 02:26:22.380]  firm that they own Kaplan business now we see moves to try to privatize public
[02:26:22.380 --> 02:26:26.580]  education the camels with the nose under the ten is private school you know
[02:26:26.580 --> 02:26:31.860]  charter schools magnet schools it's really just another word set of words
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:35.500]  for privatization and watch what you're really corporate schools those aren't
[02:26:35.500 --> 02:26:38.620]  private schools now they're bill them on the gate schools which is what
[02:26:38.620 --> 02:26:43.500]  Tarpley and others said Obama's specialty was in Chicago is actually Union
[02:26:43.500 --> 02:26:46.420]  busting but not to get rid of the corrupt unions to transfer it to the
[02:26:46.420 --> 02:26:50.500]  corporations and Rahm Emanuel's brought in as a Chicago head of the school
[02:26:50.500 --> 02:26:54.740]  board one of these people who favors that so we're going to see that continue
[02:26:54.740 --> 02:27:00.220]  in Chicago in Washington DC Arnie Duncan the Secretary of Education one of
[02:27:00.220 --> 02:27:06.500]  Obama's basketball buddies is strong for this and again I say the Washington
[02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:11.180]  Post can't even cover this adequately or properly because they own a private
[02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:16.500]  education firm that's right we're going to break here in a few minutes but let's
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:21.900]  get started now you've got some big news dealing on them trying to rewrite the
[02:27:21.900 --> 02:27:27.260]  history of Obama's family and all these intelligence agency connections because
[02:27:27.260 --> 02:27:30.140]  your research just isn't into the birth certificate a lot of it now being
[02:27:30.140 --> 02:27:35.020]  duplicated and expanded on budget on Corsi but also into his CIA connections
[02:27:35.020 --> 02:27:40.660]  well especially his his passport records and what he was doing when he was
[02:27:40.660 --> 02:27:46.500]  supposedly a Columbia and Occidental and potentially at Harvard Law what right
[02:27:46.500 --> 02:27:51.260]  now we've got an article that came out in the New York Times magazine written
[02:27:51.260 --> 02:27:56.260]  by Janie Scott who's got a book coming out about Obama's mother the thing they're
[02:27:56.260 --> 02:28:00.820]  they're changing the facts they're they're she even had an interview with
[02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:05.140]  Obama in the Oval Office but we're being told things that just did not occur
[02:28:05.140 --> 02:28:09.620]  they are changing the facts are changing Wikipedia as we speak New York
[02:28:09.620 --> 02:28:14.260]  magazine is basically a Cass Sunstein organ more and more oh I think so this
[02:28:14.260 --> 02:28:20.900]  is New York Times but what we have is Lolo Satoro the stepfather's history
[02:28:20.900 --> 02:28:26.540]  being revised we have Stanley and Dunham's history being revised we have
[02:28:26.540 --> 02:28:31.900]  the history of Indonesia prior to and after the 1965 coup against President
[02:28:31.900 --> 02:28:38.980]  Sarkis Ocarno also being revised this is happening in plain sight and we're
[02:28:38.980 --> 02:28:42.940]  supposed to believe that this New York Times reporter got the interview with
[02:28:42.940 --> 02:28:48.060]  Obama in the Oval Office spoke to all these people who knew the family without
[02:28:48.060 --> 02:28:52.780]  any independent corroboration of that so I think this is a huge there they're
[02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:56.780]  obviously preparing for this to be raised in the election campaign and this is
[02:28:56.780 --> 02:29:00.780]  sort of like a preemptive move move on their and that's more evidence of the
[02:29:00.780 --> 02:29:03.580]  guilt if it had no proof behind it they would have released the original
[02:29:03.580 --> 02:29:08.460]  certificate not the receipt they would have dispelled all this early on but all
[02:29:08.460 --> 02:29:13.260]  of his records are kept very very secret and especially the area that there's
[02:29:13.260 --> 02:29:17.460]  seems to be a lot of reluctance to go after and remember the passport file was
[02:29:17.460 --> 02:29:23.780]  being rifled through in January of 08 at the right in the primary season we had
[02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:28.180]  John Brennan's company the Analysis Corporation he's now Obama's Deputy
[02:29:28.180 --> 02:29:31.980]  National Security Advisor they were the ones committing the the the act of
[02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:36.300]  rifling through the passport file what they I think they were trying to get
[02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:40.820]  remove information we know that her of Stanley and Dunham's passport file
[02:29:40.820 --> 02:29:47.260]  prior to 68 was inadvertently destroyed we're told so I think what we have here
[02:29:47.260 --> 02:29:50.260]  and I stay there tell us what we have on the other side let's go into it in

[02:34:00.740 --> 02:34:05.420]  records now he's reported in indonesia kenya hawaii they're all destroyed
[02:34:05.420 --> 02:34:08.940]  they're all missing governor abacromby said four months ago when he was
[02:34:08.940 --> 02:34:12.780]  governor-elect oh I'm gonna get into those records he went and said okay the
[02:34:12.780 --> 02:34:16.740]  original birth certificate isn't there but it's not just that it's his whole
[02:34:16.740 --> 02:34:20.060]  background you were getting into them trying to basically rewrite history
[02:34:20.060 --> 02:34:25.220]  right now they are really really scared of this sure obama's a teleprompter
[02:34:25.220 --> 02:34:28.980]  reading puppet but if he gets politically damaged that will damage
[02:34:28.980 --> 02:34:32.780]  everything he's done well I think it's interesting what we know as some of the
[02:34:32.780 --> 02:34:37.020]  tidbits that came out in this article in New York Times magazine that we did
[02:34:37.020 --> 02:34:42.020]  not know before we found out that when Obama was you know a young boy living in
[02:34:42.020 --> 02:34:47.420]  jakarta he said he wanted to be the future prime minister of indonesia he
[02:34:47.420 --> 02:34:50.060]  also said he wants to be president of the United States at some point in time
[02:34:50.060 --> 02:34:54.380]  but I would imagine you could not be the prime minister of indonesia unless you
[02:34:54.380 --> 02:34:58.900]  were somehow you knew that you were an indonesian citizen well he changed his
[02:34:58.900 --> 02:35:03.860]  name to Barry Sotaro Barry Barry who's saying Sotaro we're also now told that
[02:35:03.860 --> 02:35:09.420]  Lolo Sotaro according to this this article in New York Times that Lolo
[02:35:09.420 --> 02:35:15.860]  Sotaro worked not as a government relations person for mobile oil which we
[02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:19.500]  were told he did is sort of like payback for the work he did to help install
[02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:23.500]  suharto with the CIA with the CIA coup now we're totally worked for
[02:35:23.500 --> 02:35:30.020]  Unical Union Oil of California so that's changed we've got we've got this
[02:35:30.020 --> 02:35:35.980]  report from somebody who was in Indonesia the same time Stanley and Dunham the
[02:35:35.980 --> 02:35:40.340]  mother was there saying oh in the late 60s and early 70s indonesia was like it
[02:35:40.340 --> 02:35:44.460]  they called it the indonesian Prague Spring it was a honeymoon there were
[02:35:44.460 --> 02:35:49.180]  there was freedom of the press and student groups were had a lot where
[02:35:49.180 --> 02:35:52.740]  where are they getting this stuff from Suharto was a brutal dictator he was a
[02:35:52.740 --> 02:35:58.220]  brutal dictator up until he left office basically he he was responsible for the
[02:35:58.220 --> 02:36:03.020]  brutal invasion and occupation of East Timor in 1975 mass murders mass
[02:36:03.020 --> 02:36:07.460]  executions so this is all being rewritten to make it look like the
[02:36:07.460 --> 02:36:11.260]  time that Stanley and Dunham was in Indonesia there was this Prague Spring
[02:36:11.260 --> 02:36:14.820]  and she was his headbanded hippie running around throwing flowers at
[02:36:14.820 --> 02:36:19.580]  everybody when in fact she was she was pinpointing people for the indonesian
[02:36:19.580 --> 02:36:23.780]  army to go out and massacre who were suspected of being communist or
[02:36:23.780 --> 02:36:28.400]  anti-regime that's what she was she was posing as a leftist absolutely
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:32.980]  absolutely and and and that's why they you're getting the threats through the
[02:36:32.980 --> 02:36:38.700]  State Department and a foreign embassy in a major publication because they're
[02:36:38.700 --> 02:36:43.220]  they're concerned about their smoke then there's fire with the birth certificate
[02:36:43.220 --> 02:36:47.540]  but it's really this intelligence background they're worried about
[02:36:47.540 --> 02:36:52.620]  absolutely I think this is the thing that can sink them I think this this can
[02:36:52.620 --> 02:36:58.100]  open up the door if Obama traveled to Pakistan in 1981 on an indonesian
[02:36:58.100 --> 02:37:03.100]  passport if he had an indonesian passport he had already committed himself to
[02:37:03.100 --> 02:37:09.460]  feel tea to another sovereign he cannot be the president of the United States I
[02:37:09.460 --> 02:37:13.380]  you know I know there's people with dual passports but let's look at the fact
[02:37:13.380 --> 02:37:18.260]  that he he supposedly goes to Occidental on a foreign students
[02:37:18.260 --> 02:37:22.340]  scholarship program that was only available to foreign students so we see
[02:37:22.340 --> 02:37:26.100]  it when you give up your citizenship because a lot of countries only you have
[02:37:26.100 --> 02:37:30.100]  dual indonesia you have to give it up he gave it up he would have had to give it
[02:37:30.100 --> 02:37:35.540]  up right in Indonesia does not permit dual citizenship and so so we have an
[02:37:35.540 --> 02:37:39.820]  issue here and you know by the way I hope folks know I mean you're a serious
[02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:43.340]  journalist who's never said you've been death-threaded before you've been let
[02:37:43.340 --> 02:37:46.860]  me you've been told I mean what you're doing is dangerous right now just like
[02:37:46.860 --> 02:37:50.940]  when I had the DC madam on the show a few months before they killed her and we
[02:37:50.940 --> 02:37:55.300]  talked to her landlord at the condo or the manager she said they're following
[02:37:55.300 --> 02:37:59.460]  me I got these papers to my mom's he sent me copies of release it was not her
[02:37:59.460 --> 02:38:03.780]  handwriting she said on air no I'll never kill myself I mean they killed her
[02:38:03.780 --> 02:38:07.820]  I hope people know you're risking your life with what you're doing right now
[02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:11.740]  this is this is an important story and and I think the White House is somewhat
[02:38:11.740 --> 02:38:14.900]  comfortable with the birth certificate story because they they know that there's
[02:38:14.900 --> 02:38:19.780]  all these dead ends there but I I think that it's the it's the passports it's
[02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:24.820]  Obama's past in Indonesia and what he did when he's ostensibly at Columbia
[02:38:24.820 --> 02:38:29.220]  Occidental and Harvard that really and and also when he was supposedly a
[02:38:29.220 --> 02:38:36.700]  community organizer not he wasn't he was he was obviously informing on the some
[02:38:36.700 --> 02:38:42.100]  of the black groups in Chicago at the time the Al Rukin gang the the Black
[02:38:42.100 --> 02:38:47.260]  Panther Party the nation of Islam he was plopped in there those people in South
[02:38:47.260 --> 02:38:51.980]  Chicago did not trust I've spoken to them they did not trust Obama he was just a
[02:38:51.980 --> 02:38:55.700]  little too cool for that's right you spent a lot of time in Chicago absolutely
[02:38:55.700 --> 02:39:00.260]  and I've had discussions with people who work with the nation of Islam work for
[02:39:00.260 --> 02:39:05.100]  the Black Panther Party were knew the guy that ran the El Rukin gang and look
[02:39:05.100 --> 02:39:10.780]  the El Rukins at the time when he plopped in there in 86 from from that CIA job
[02:39:10.780 --> 02:39:15.620]  in Manhattan this was at the height of that you look at the Chicago Tribune
[02:39:15.620 --> 02:39:20.740]  El Rukin gang thought to be doing a deal you know getting a deal with Gaddafi to
[02:39:20.740 --> 02:39:25.180]  get shoulder-launched missiles to shoot down planes at O'Hare now we see Obama
[02:39:25.180 --> 02:39:30.340]  is attacking Libya is this score settling is this is this is this somebody
[02:39:30.340 --> 02:39:34.580]  that he had a problem with way back then because he was looking at these these
[02:39:34.580 --> 02:39:39.940]  groups in Chicago and their potential lengths or a legend lengths to Gaddafi it
[02:39:39.940 --> 02:39:44.340]  looks like maybe we see a little bit of score settling here Allah George W. Bush
[02:39:44.340 --> 02:39:49.620]  with Saddam Hussein well they're definitely scared of this whole
[02:39:49.620 --> 02:39:54.660]  intelligence minion background we know these agencies mainly were a recruit for
[02:39:54.660 --> 02:40:01.500]  higher-level positions out of families go over the basic spectrum of the
[02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:06.180]  intelligence background connections in his family well let's start with let's
[02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:11.860]  start with his grandparents Stanley Ormer Dunham his grandfather's ostensibly
[02:40:11.860 --> 02:40:17.340]  was in World War two was in France comes back the United States and works for a
[02:40:17.340 --> 02:40:24.980]  series of furniture stores in Oklahoma in Kansas and in Washington State and
[02:40:24.980 --> 02:40:32.460]  any all of a sudden goes to work for one in in Hawaii you know I mean you could
[02:40:32.460 --> 02:40:35.620]  maybe see that with chain furniture stores but look at let's look at the
[02:40:35.620 --> 02:40:39.220]  time frame he was going from one store to another they were not part of like
[02:40:39.220 --> 02:40:44.500]  the Levitt's furniture chain this looks like a military transfer but I would
[02:40:44.500 --> 02:40:49.020]  suggest it was an intelligence agency transfer from place to place he doesn't
[02:40:49.020 --> 02:40:54.500]  show up in Washington State until 1956 with the daughter Obama's mother is
[02:40:54.500 --> 02:41:00.580]  enrolled in high school there the word is that potentially they he and his wife
[02:41:00.580 --> 02:41:05.220]  Madeline Dunham were working for the Office of Strategic Services in Beirut
[02:41:05.220 --> 02:41:11.180]  starting in 42 until about 56 we know that things were getting dicey in Lebanon
[02:41:11.180 --> 02:41:16.180]  1958 President Eisenhower sent the Marines in airstorm to shore occupy the
[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:20.420]  country for about a year so it would make sense for them to get their daughter
[02:41:20.420 --> 02:41:25.940]  out of there to get the agents who had families out of country shows up in
[02:41:25.940 --> 02:41:31.220]  Seattle and Mercer Island and then a few years later boom he's he pops up as a
[02:41:31.220 --> 02:41:36.740]  furniture store salesman in Honolulu that the Pratt furniture by the way only
[02:41:36.740 --> 02:41:43.220]  exists in corporate records it was not a brick-and-mortar store in Honolulu
[02:41:43.220 --> 02:41:47.220]  there's no record of a press cover is a furniture salesman absolutely and he
[02:41:47.220 --> 02:41:51.580]  wouldn't be the only one I think it we all know Julie a child worked for the
[02:41:51.580 --> 02:41:56.620]  OSS and CIA before she won't before she went to work for the OSS during World
[02:41:56.620 --> 02:42:01.260]  War two she worked for a furniture store in Manhattan so this is a seems to be
[02:42:01.260 --> 02:42:05.420]  fairly standard kind of odd why furniture stores maybe it's because they move large
[02:42:05.420 --> 02:42:10.140]  amounts of goods it's also non-script it doesn't really ring a bell yes people
[02:42:10.140 --> 02:42:18.140]  know to watch journalists and nature photographers and you know Christian
[02:42:18.140 --> 02:42:21.460]  groups of mercenaries they don't think about furniture but then we get into
[02:42:21.460 --> 02:42:24.380]  other parts of the family it's on record they're working for high-powered
[02:42:24.380 --> 02:42:28.660]  groups alright and let's look at the CIA's use of anthropologists his mother
[02:42:28.660 --> 02:42:32.020]  ostensibly an anthropologist we that's one of their favorite because they go
[02:42:32.020 --> 02:42:35.820]  to the most world absolutely now that's called the human terrain system which
[02:42:35.820 --> 02:42:40.580]  they send these people out to basically just parse people to different tribes
[02:42:40.580 --> 02:42:45.020]  ethnic groups for targeting purposes for if they ever need to play people off
[02:42:45.020 --> 02:42:48.020]  against each other they've already got totally and this has been gone on for a
[02:42:48.020 --> 02:42:52.140]  long time it was done with the OSS by the way we get to the OSS turn World War
[02:42:52.140 --> 02:42:57.660]  two OSS agent also worked for British intelligence who was an anthropologist
[02:42:57.660 --> 02:43:03.020]  worked extensively in South America he was his last name was was clothier he
[02:43:03.020 --> 02:43:07.420]  was from the straw bridge and clothier department store family in Philadelphia so
[02:43:07.420 --> 02:43:10.980]  here we get back to the stores the merchandise activities again another
[02:43:10.980 --> 02:43:15.840]  one was connected to the Lothrop family that ran Woodward and Lothrop
[02:43:15.840 --> 02:43:19.540]  department store in Washington so that there seems to be a you know that goes
[02:43:19.540 --> 02:43:22.180]  back to the Dutch and British East India company where they had their
[02:43:22.180 --> 02:43:26.660]  intelligence officers on the trading ships that was their entree into the
[02:43:26.660 --> 02:43:31.220]  interiors of what South America Central America Africa Asia to Dutch East
[02:43:31.220 --> 02:43:36.220]  Indies absolutely we have people going out to purchase obviously goods to be
[02:43:36.220 --> 02:43:39.860]  sold in these stores in the United States it's great cover and it seems like
[02:43:39.860 --> 02:43:45.780]  OSS NCI used used that to a great extent so the idea that a Stanley armored
[02:43:45.780 --> 02:43:50.980]  Dunham's cover was a furniture store guy salesman is not all that bizarre it
[02:43:50.980 --> 02:43:54.380]  seems that at first glance it looks bizarre but we see how he's all over the
[02:43:54.380 --> 02:43:58.100]  world continue over the world all over that also the reports that he may have
[02:43:58.100 --> 02:44:05.020]  taken Obama's mother to Cuba at the onset of the Cuban Revolution circa 1960
[02:44:05.020 --> 02:44:09.380]  Wow continue with the rest of the family okay we so we have Madeline Dunham the
[02:44:09.380 --> 02:44:12.980]  grandmother work one of the first female vice presidents of the Bank of
[02:44:12.980 --> 02:44:18.580]  Hawaii unbelievable rise for somebody where we still had the glass ceiling
[02:44:18.580 --> 02:44:22.820]  and management positions for many women she rises to vice president she's in
[02:44:22.820 --> 02:44:27.700]  charge of escrow accounts for the Bank of Hawaii clearly the Bank of Hawaii was
[02:44:27.700 --> 02:44:32.420]  used by several CIA front activities as a pass through to pay off various
[02:44:32.420 --> 02:44:37.340]  dictators during her entire time at the Bank of Hawaii we had the Nugent Hand
[02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:42.780]  Bank which was a CIA front that replaced by another operation in Honolulu after
[02:44:42.780 --> 02:44:48.100]  Nugent Hand collapsed these were CIA activities and the Bank of Hawaii was
[02:44:48.100 --> 02:44:53.820]  facilitating and she was right in the middle of it all it's like pre BCCI and
[02:44:53.820 --> 02:44:57.860]  and we know the history of the banks you just mentioned continue we have now
[02:44:57.860 --> 02:45:04.420]  Lolo Satoro again his in his history is being reinvented in this New York Times
[02:45:04.420 --> 02:45:13.380]  peace Lolo Satoro marries Obama's mother in March of 1965 in May of 65 he's
[02:45:13.380 --> 02:45:17.260]  called back because he's a reserve officer in the Indonesian Army Suharto
[02:45:17.260 --> 02:45:21.660]  wants to get all these reservists back to help plan the coup and the article in
[02:45:21.660 --> 02:45:26.140]  the New York Times is it states that Lolo Satoro was called back and
[02:45:26.140 --> 02:45:30.420]  conscripted in the military now conscripted means to go in as an enlisted
[02:45:30.420 --> 02:45:34.220]  man and that they were sent to fight rebels in West New Guinea getting him
[02:45:34.220 --> 02:45:41.220]  out of Java entirely where of course Obama's mother shows up in 1967 then
[02:45:41.220 --> 02:45:44.900]  they're painting this whole thing that oh Suharto comes in and he creates this
[02:45:44.900 --> 02:45:49.100]  sort of Indonesian Prague Spring this is this is fake history this did not
[02:45:49.100 --> 02:45:52.700]  happen we'd look at if you were a communist or a liberal they hunted you
[02:45:52.700 --> 02:45:55.740]  down and blow your head off they're about 800,000 to a million people were
[02:45:55.740 --> 02:45:59.620]  killed there ethnic Chinese too because it turns out that's that's Obama's dad
[02:45:59.620 --> 02:46:03.620]  specialty in Africa is posing as a commie and finding the folks to wipe out
[02:46:03.620 --> 02:46:07.100]  absolutely and then it's Obama's specialty and I'm sorry right well we
[02:46:07.100 --> 02:46:11.700]  have Barack senior of course who comes over the thing that's common is the East
[02:46:11.700 --> 02:46:16.100]  West Center at the University of Hawaii CIA front known to be Lolo Satoro
[02:46:16.100 --> 02:46:21.380]  Barack Obama senior both at that East West Center known to be a CIA front he
[02:46:21.380 --> 02:46:25.740]  sent eventually back to Kenya to try to get him into the Kenyan government
[02:46:25.740 --> 02:46:30.260]  because he's the wrong tribe he's not he's in a significant minority tribe but
[02:46:30.260 --> 02:46:35.260]  not the dominant tribe he does not get in to be the finance minister so here we
[02:46:35.260 --> 02:46:38.460]  have Obama president Obama saying he wanted to be Prime Minister of Indonesia
[02:46:38.460 --> 02:46:43.260]  had his father or his alleged father become say the president of Kenya
[02:46:43.260 --> 02:46:47.180]  Barack Obama our president could very well be the president of Kenya today
[02:46:47.180 --> 02:46:50.820]  certainly the son the point is they were positioning him all over he was like a
[02:46:50.820 --> 02:46:55.860]  skeleton key absolutely so you know what what country you want to be leader of
[02:46:55.860 --> 02:47:00.460]  President Obama it sounds like you had three shots at that being president of
[02:47:00.460 --> 02:47:04.620]  some country Prime Minister of Indonesia president of Kenya potentially and but
[02:47:04.620 --> 02:47:09.020]  now president of the United States and and the intelligence connections
[02:47:09.020 --> 02:47:13.020]  continue I've read connections with his father in Kenya to British Intel we know
[02:47:13.020 --> 02:47:18.060]  they were all over Kenya well we that we see the father brought over in 1960 on
[02:47:18.060 --> 02:47:23.100]  the Airlift Africa project that was an attempt to try to compete with the
[02:47:23.100 --> 02:47:27.340]  Soviet Union that created the People's Friendship University Moscow 1961 they
[02:47:27.340 --> 02:47:32.580]  renamed that Patrice Lumumba University as a CIA knocked him off in Congo in that
[02:47:32.580 --> 02:47:38.780]  year so we we see a Baraka senior coming over on the CIA funded they even got
[02:47:38.780 --> 02:47:44.820]  some money from the Joe's of Kennedy Foundation to help with that and so we
[02:47:44.820 --> 02:47:49.980]  see him coming in but then that marriage you know fritters away it looks like
[02:47:49.980 --> 02:47:55.260]  Barack Obama's mother was actually being introduced by the father her father to
[02:47:55.260 --> 02:47:59.900]  all these potential third world leaders movers and shakers I mean what kind of
[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:06.420]  father would basically have what do they call those honey pot a swallow yeah
[02:48:06.420 --> 02:48:11.260]  well honey pot but he's you know but you know is his daughter's like 18 years old
[02:48:11.260 --> 02:48:15.980]  he's introducing her all these people from these various you know Barack senior
[02:48:15.980 --> 02:48:20.580]  certainly and she gets pregnant and that's like Clinton's mother was an
[02:48:20.580 --> 02:48:24.660]  admitted prostitute yeah I mean this is you know you got it you get kind of
[02:48:24.660 --> 02:48:29.340]  wonder what kind of family was this to you know especially and of course the
[02:48:29.340 --> 02:48:35.420]  big thing is Baraka a senior and and a Donovan meet at a Russian language class
[02:48:35.420 --> 02:48:40.340]  at the University of Hawaii in 1960 now who's taking Russian during the height
[02:48:40.340 --> 02:48:43.740]  of the Cold War you know this is this is at the height of the you to the
[02:48:43.740 --> 02:48:50.900]  situation and you know it's Eisenhower transitioning to Kennedy it's the height
[02:48:50.900 --> 02:48:55.220]  of the cold it just goes on for hours all the intelligence connections absolutely
[02:48:55.220 --> 02:48:59.540]  you get that you can keep you can keep peeling back this onion and you'll still
[02:48:59.540 --> 02:49:04.380]  find more connections and I mean you can you can go back to the Bush family and
[02:49:04.380 --> 02:49:08.420]  obviously yeah we know George H. W. Bush was CIA director we know he was in
[02:49:08.420 --> 02:49:12.500]  Dallas during the you know when the Kennedy it's now been declassified he
[02:49:12.500 --> 02:49:16.420]  was in the CIA before he said absolutely we but we they didn't just make him
[02:49:16.420 --> 02:49:21.140]  director right we but we kind of knew that from documents that finally but
[02:49:21.140 --> 02:49:25.780]  with Obama we have all these gaping holes it's like so see that's that left
[02:49:25.780 --> 02:49:30.940]  cover I mean when it comes out he's CIA that is gonna really destroy the myth
[02:49:30.940 --> 02:49:35.940]  of the Messianic you know a little surfer boy oh absolutely this whole
[02:49:35.940 --> 02:49:40.860]  idea that again in the New York Times or ago they say that the Obamas of the
[02:49:40.860 --> 02:49:45.140]  Satoros were living in a very poor neighborhood they had to hunt wild boar
[02:49:45.140 --> 02:49:49.460]  to get something on the table they lived in the Mentang district which at the
[02:49:49.460 --> 02:49:54.220]  time was the brand new diplomatic kind of compound for the diplomats and the
[02:49:54.220 --> 02:49:57.100]  high-level government officials what are they talking about so they've got the
[02:49:57.100 --> 02:50:00.940]  Swiss family Robinson thing going for yeah yeah why don't they just say he
[02:50:00.940 --> 02:50:04.940]  came from Krypton and landed in a flying saucer I think he's even joked about
[02:50:04.940 --> 02:50:10.060]  that himself yeah we do have a clip of that but but but that but it's it's just
[02:50:10.060 --> 02:50:14.780]  amazing to see how the how the New York Times and the White House are working
[02:50:14.780 --> 02:50:19.060]  together to rewrite his history and that's why you but I mean you were told
[02:50:19.060 --> 02:50:21.460]  or you're guessing that's why you're getting threats from the White House I
[02:50:21.460 --> 02:50:27.540]  assume because there are some of the initial threat was passed to me by it

[02:55:10.460 --> 02:55:13.020]  long time ago now they're letting you know because they're starting to use it

[02:56:13.020 --> 02:56:19.980]  information more truth again info wars.com or 888-25-33139 now I'm only
[02:56:19.980 --> 02:56:23.820]  gonna spend a few minutes with Ted on this gold is up I don't know three or
[02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:28.860]  four bucks today silver went within a few cents of $50 it's all-time record
[02:56:28.860 --> 02:56:33.940]  high and then they drove it down a few bucks obviously with the open
[02:56:33.940 --> 02:56:39.780]  announcements that the dollar is to be fully scrapped for a time you heard
[02:56:39.780 --> 02:56:43.420]  Dr. Roberts they may try to manipulate it down but it's only going to go up in
[02:56:43.420 --> 02:56:48.380]  the long term briefly Ted what are today's specials now that you've got
[02:56:48.380 --> 02:56:52.980]  for listeners while your video special right now is going to be 125 I did have
[02:56:52.980 --> 02:56:56.700]  to raise that just a little bit but I'm really keeping it to the tight here I
[02:56:56.700 --> 02:57:00.100]  mean I tell you if people were just to buy the silver dollars the three of
[02:57:00.100 --> 02:57:05.500]  them alone would put that particular deal well over 140 without the videos
[02:57:05.500 --> 02:57:08.900]  that's three silver dollars free shipping and three of my best-selling films
[02:57:08.900 --> 02:57:14.180]  for 125 that's about $80 off it is it's it's a it's a huge discount so of course
[02:57:14.180 --> 02:57:19.420]  we have the Franks at 331 British sovereigns for 15 we have buffaloes we
[02:57:19.420 --> 02:57:23.460]  have us eagles I mean right now those survival bags of dimes that I keep
[02:57:23.460 --> 02:57:28.460]  talking about now it takes 36 dimes the newer dime to buy one of the older dime
[02:57:28.460 --> 02:57:32.700]  last time I was on the air with you was 32 I mean that's where the trend is
[02:57:32.700 --> 02:57:37.980]  going there's three trillion dollars in China right now looking for a conservative
[02:57:37.980 --> 02:57:43.660]  place to park its money there's only about 1.5 1.5 trillion dollars with
[02:57:43.660 --> 02:57:48.300]  the gold bullion in the entire world to buy that gives you an idea what the
[02:57:48.300 --> 02:57:52.700]  ratios like right now the stock market's getting hit all equities are getting hit
[02:57:52.700 --> 02:57:58.500]  the Fed just today Alex the Fed bought an above average amount of US government
[02:57:58.500 --> 02:58:02.780]  treasuries trying to keep this thing all glued together it is not look no we're
[02:58:02.780 --> 02:58:06.380]  on a racer's edge I hope folks take advantage of these radio specials

[03:00:23.420 --> 03:00:27.380]  I want to get into the TSA the economy a little bit more but finishing up with
[03:00:27.380 --> 03:00:31.340]  Obama's background from all the pieces you've got and of course you're gonna be
[03:00:31.340 --> 03:00:33.860]  traveling around the world doing some more investigation now people should
[03:00:33.860 --> 03:00:38.020]  pray for you and support you at Wayne Madsen report dot com which is a
[03:00:38.020 --> 03:00:43.220]  subscription site folks real journalists need your support out there as you you
[03:00:43.220 --> 03:00:47.980]  know as you're on this trail looking at enough pieces of the jigsaw what does it
[03:00:47.980 --> 03:00:53.220]  look like to you well I think it's clear that Obama was groomed from very young
[03:00:53.220 --> 03:00:58.860]  age and that's not to say he was the only one they probably have all kinds of
[03:00:58.860 --> 03:01:05.060]  people are grooming for the highest office in the country but I think Obama
[03:01:05.060 --> 03:01:09.700]  was the right person at the right time after eight years of Bush they put that
[03:01:09.700 --> 03:01:13.500]  hope and change message out like it was a Pepsi commercial the logo was even the
[03:01:13.500 --> 03:01:19.900]  same as the Pepsi advertising logo and we bought it I remember of course in 68
[03:01:19.900 --> 03:01:25.340]  when they repackaged Richard Nixon it's the new Nixon it was like a new brand of
[03:01:25.340 --> 03:01:29.700]  detergent it wasn't the old Nixon with the five o'clock shadow you won't have
[03:01:29.700 --> 03:01:34.140]  Dick Nixon to kick they did the same thing with with Obama but I think
[03:01:34.140 --> 03:01:38.860]  unlike Richard Nixon this was an intelligence agency operation I wouldn't
[03:01:38.860 --> 03:01:43.460]  suggest that the CIA had much to do with Richard Nixon as a matter of fact they
[03:01:43.460 --> 03:01:46.620]  probably had a lot to do with removing him from the way yeah they're tired of
[03:01:46.620 --> 03:01:50.940]  strong presidents that actually exercise the executive power they want purely
[03:01:50.940 --> 03:01:56.940]  held kept minions right and so the word I get from about Obama from people who
[03:01:56.940 --> 03:02:03.060]  see him on Air Force One who encounter him is he's very cold he's arrogant they
[03:02:03.060 --> 03:02:07.780]  will say good morning mr. President he won't respond I mean at least George W
[03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:12.660]  Bush did that you know I mean you know he might have been an idiot an idiot in
[03:02:12.660 --> 03:02:17.500]  all other respects but but we have a guy who thinks I think he believes he's
[03:02:17.500 --> 03:02:21.620]  entitled he's been told he he said you know other than saying you want to be
[03:02:21.620 --> 03:02:24.460]  president of indonesia he said you want to be president of the United States so
[03:02:24.460 --> 03:02:29.900]  clearly he and they were told well you know because he had this rags to Richard's
[03:02:29.900 --> 03:02:33.180]  story there was never any rags in his back right he's looking more well he's
[03:02:33.180 --> 03:02:37.620]  very polished he's looking more and more angry these days though well yeah oh yes
[03:02:37.620 --> 03:02:42.060]  I think it's getting to him I think from what I understand he has a very thin
[03:02:42.060 --> 03:02:47.780]  skin for criticism and at one point in time there was some feeling that maybe
[03:02:47.780 --> 03:02:52.260]  he wasn't going to run again for reelection but but his wife Michelle
[03:02:52.260 --> 03:02:57.140]  was apparently the same way very thin skin when it comes to criticism but
[03:02:57.140 --> 03:03:01.780]  this this election may not be a cake while he got a cakewalk the last time
[03:03:01.780 --> 03:03:06.740]  okay it got a little bit nasty between him and Hillary but I think now he's got
[03:03:06.740 --> 03:03:10.700]  his four years to run on doing everything for Wall Street nothing for
[03:03:10.700 --> 03:03:14.020]  main street where does stage terror play in because I really see a lot of
[03:03:14.020 --> 03:03:17.900]  White House advisors as you know are in the news saying man gee a terror attack
[03:03:17.900 --> 03:03:21.620]  would really help us well yes and we knew you know look at Cass Sunstein with
[03:03:21.620 --> 03:03:27.420]  all his cognitive disinformation infiltration a Rahm Emanuel you never
[03:03:27.420 --> 03:03:31.780]  let a good crisis go to waste he's now mayor he will be soon to mayor of
[03:03:31.780 --> 03:03:37.540]  Chicago I really fear for Chicago because I think all the right they have
[03:03:37.540 --> 03:03:41.780]  the highest gas prices there right and we've got Larry Silverstein now the
[03:03:41.780 --> 03:03:45.580]  owner of the Willis Tower the former Sears Tower we've got all kinds of
[03:03:45.580 --> 03:03:50.980]  military operations going on in Chicago and there's some been some very
[03:03:50.980 --> 03:03:56.620]  strange financial dealings that have been passed on to me about maritime
[03:03:56.620 --> 03:04:02.420]  leans against the Treasury Department put it you know leans that were put in
[03:04:02.420 --> 03:04:07.220]  by the governor of Illinois secretary of state Chicago police what's going on in
[03:04:07.220 --> 03:04:11.700]  Chicago I think we have to really be fearful of the city of Chicago and
[03:04:11.700 --> 03:04:16.140]  what would Obama sacrifice Chicago he has no roots in Chicago other than the
[03:04:16.140 --> 03:04:20.260]  fact he was plopped in there by some federal agency so a lot of people in

[03:08:01.580 --> 03:08:17.020]  I was a high way to get a journalist Wayne Madsen with us we're here alive
[03:08:17.020 --> 03:08:22.700]  into the fourth hour today it is the 25th day of April 2011 on this Monday
[03:08:22.700 --> 03:08:26.020]  edition and we're gonna go to some of your phone calls here in a moment but
[03:08:26.020 --> 03:08:29.380]  finishing up you're saying you spent a lot of time in Chicago in the last year
[03:08:29.380 --> 03:08:34.580]  investigating the mafia connections that are pretty much public and so bottom
[03:08:34.580 --> 03:08:38.500]  line you're saying they're sending Rahm Emanuel the admitted Israeli operative
[03:08:38.500 --> 03:08:42.500]  over there to what get things ready for a little special event well I
[03:08:42.500 --> 03:08:47.220]  certainly would be worried about what could happen in Chicago because let's
[03:08:47.220 --> 03:08:52.980]  look at Obama covering up various aspects of his own private life there is
[03:08:52.980 --> 03:08:58.700]  and some of his closest advisors and we also have to realize there was a train
[03:08:58.700 --> 03:09:03.860]  Rahm Emanuel leaves it as White House Chief of Staff winds up as Mayor
[03:09:03.860 --> 03:09:09.060]  Chicago Bill Daley's brother I'm Mayor Richard Daley's brother Bill Daley is
[03:09:09.060 --> 03:09:13.420]  now the White House Chief of Staff very nice little and he was one of the guys
[03:09:13.420 --> 03:09:18.220]  in the whole banker scam oh absolutely you know he was you know Morgan Stanley
[03:09:18.220 --> 03:09:23.580]  the whole part of the whole bailout you know instead of being White House Chief
[03:09:23.580 --> 03:09:28.100]  of Staff why isn't he under indictment I mean this is what Elliot Spitzer is
[03:09:28.100 --> 03:09:32.500]  saying about what where where the jail senses where has been Eric Holder the
[03:09:32.500 --> 03:09:37.100]  Attorney General on indicting these people they only took out a couple of
[03:09:37.100 --> 03:09:43.300]  them and I think we have to really look at this nexus between Bill Daley the
[03:09:43.300 --> 03:09:48.580]  Chief of Staff Obama's from Chicago Valerie Jarrett is a slumlord land
[03:09:48.580 --> 03:09:54.660]  scam artist from Chicago Axelrod is going back to Chicago to run the Obama
[03:09:54.660 --> 03:09:59.900]  campaign we got a manual there is mayor I mean what what it's a perfect city if
[03:09:59.900 --> 03:10:04.340]  they wanted to pull something off I would add that Sam Zell is the owner of
[03:10:04.340 --> 03:10:10.340]  the Chicago Tribune and you know he's they've emaciated the investigative
[03:10:10.340 --> 03:10:15.220]  staffs of the two major Chicago newspapers the the Chicago Tribune and
[03:10:15.220 --> 03:10:18.900]  the Sun Times so there's nobody there except for some bloggers and some
[03:10:18.900 --> 03:10:22.700]  independent journalists who are really looking into what's been going on I've
[03:10:22.700 --> 03:10:26.860]  seen independent journalists when ROMs out in public in a park they try to talk
[03:10:26.860 --> 03:10:30.980]  to him and the media roughs them up I mean they just love being servants oh
[03:10:30.980 --> 03:10:36.620]  absolutely I mean there really isn't any more independent media as a major
[03:10:36.620 --> 03:10:41.860]  mainstream media in the city of Chicago now this is a town with a rich
[03:10:41.860 --> 03:10:46.420]  history of muckraking journalists you know Mike Royco we can go the list goes
[03:10:46.420 --> 03:10:51.980]  on and on but they don't exist there to any great extent any longer
[03:10:51.980 --> 03:10:56.900]  what do you expect the Republicans to do because they're they're basically
[03:10:56.900 --> 03:11:01.900]  scapegoating the welfare moms which is part of the bankruptcy but if you don't
[03:11:01.900 --> 03:11:04.820]  deal with the private Federal Reserve the root of the scam everything else is
[03:11:04.820 --> 03:11:09.540]  rearranging deck chairs well I mean yes yeah look look at the republic I personally
[03:11:09.540 --> 03:11:14.020]  I think that Obama will be reelected I mean I you know look at the Republican
[03:11:14.020 --> 03:11:19.820]  side that is going to be a three-ring circus without the circus master you
[03:11:19.820 --> 03:11:24.300]  know Donald Trump he's a side show now they're you know he's he's criticizing
[03:11:24.300 --> 03:11:28.660]  Carl Rove and you know that it's a food fight and it will remain a food fight
[03:11:28.660 --> 03:11:33.940]  up through the primaries and to the convention isn't it funny Obama has no
[03:11:33.940 --> 03:11:38.940]  body on the Democratic side willing to challenge him in the primary Dennis
[03:11:38.940 --> 03:11:43.900]  Cassini said he should have a challenger my feeling is the way the Obama
[03:11:43.900 --> 03:11:50.740]  administration is acted like a mafia I think they've scared basically any
[03:11:50.740 --> 03:11:55.620]  potential rival who would take Obama on in the in the in the Democratic primary
[03:11:55.620 --> 03:11:59.020]  I don't think we're gonna we may see some minor people but I don't think we're
[03:11:59.020 --> 03:12:03.580]  gonna see a major well the word is a lot of Republicans think that for more
[03:12:03.580 --> 03:12:08.220]  years of Obama will even submit their takeover even more right and of course
[03:12:08.220 --> 03:12:12.380]  they're looking at future elections possibly you know taking over this
[03:12:12.380 --> 03:12:18.940]  Senate and eventually you know locking in the White House in a pretty much
[03:12:18.940 --> 03:12:25.580]  landslide victory trifecta right and yeah and and look Wall Street what do
[03:12:25.580 --> 03:12:29.380]  they what problems do they have with Obama he's given them everything he's
[03:12:29.380 --> 03:12:34.300]  he's he's screwed over Main Street but he's given Wall Street everything so if
[03:12:34.300 --> 03:12:38.740]  it ain't and he puts the liberals to sleep now they like torture and war it's
[03:12:38.740 --> 03:12:42.500]  kind of liberal and cute right we can't you know you can't even muster a big
[03:12:42.500 --> 03:12:45.320]  crowd for an anti-war demonstrate that's what I've said to Republicans that
[03:12:45.320 --> 03:12:49.020]  criticize Obama his rhetoric's different but his actions are George Bush
[03:12:49.020 --> 03:12:54.980]  squared you guys should love it right and he's even seen and raised Bush on
[03:12:54.980 --> 03:12:59.300]  some issues like going after whistleblowers in the government we've
[03:12:59.300 --> 03:13:04.900]  now got one guy former official the NSA being charged under the espionage act of
[03:13:04.900 --> 03:13:09.500]  1917 only four people in the history of the United States have been charged under
[03:13:09.500 --> 03:13:14.860]  that act and we have Tom Drake now his trial starting in Baltimore soon and
[03:13:14.860 --> 03:13:19.540]  they're there want to put him away forever cause he not because he revealed
[03:13:19.540 --> 03:13:23.540]  anything of a national security nature he revealed that there was massive
[03:13:23.540 --> 03:13:28.140]  corruption with contracts and NSA that to the tune of billions and billions of
[03:13:28.140 --> 03:13:33.300]  dollars the other publicly going after him for exposing fraud that message is
[03:13:33.300 --> 03:13:37.500]  let us steal the money where mafia sit down and shut up absolutely and and he
[03:13:37.500 --> 03:13:42.180]  the people he's talking about where Michael Hayden who was the NSA director
[03:13:42.180 --> 03:13:45.780]  at the time in the current director who's now got the added hat of cyber
[03:13:45.780 --> 03:13:51.320]  command General Keith Alexander and it was Obama that gave him that that extra
[03:13:51.320 --> 03:13:54.620]  star in that new commands by the way I'm really worried about him running a
[03:13:54.620 --> 03:13:57.820]  false flag on the web and then saving it by taking the freedom away they're
[03:13:57.820 --> 03:14:02.340]  really prepping everybody for that and in Obama said he was gonna have the most
[03:14:02.340 --> 03:14:06.380]  transparent and open government in history and he is cracked down on freedom
[03:14:06.380 --> 03:14:11.380]  of information act releases I mean this is going beyond what even Bush did Bush
[03:14:11.380 --> 03:14:18.420]  was kind of benign in that respect so yes and in many respects Obama is worse
[03:14:18.420 --> 03:14:22.260]  on some issues and so Republicans that fought tyranny was cool they ought to
[03:14:22.260 --> 03:14:25.460]  really love what Obama's doing they well they should the Neil I think the
[03:14:25.460 --> 03:14:29.220]  neocons you know the neocons don't you know that they're happy with them but
[03:14:29.220 --> 03:14:33.100]  they wish he would go further they would like we heard we you know McCain's over
[03:14:33.100 --> 03:14:36.740]  there and in a Libya the other day standing in front of one of these rebel
[03:14:36.740 --> 03:14:41.780]  flags the old monarchist flag saying we need to have troops here you know this
[03:14:41.780 --> 03:14:44.820]  is the troops are already there he's getting ready you've been to Libya what's
[03:14:44.820 --> 03:14:49.220]  your view of it well I was there in October of 09 I was in Gaddafi's tan he
[03:14:49.220 --> 03:14:52.940]  was celebrating the 40th anniversary of his rebel his revolution he called the
[03:14:52.940 --> 03:14:57.500]  Green Revolution has nothing to do with the environment I might add and it was
[03:14:57.500 --> 03:15:01.700]  quite clear that it was a dictatorship but you know with all what he said about
[03:15:01.700 --> 03:15:06.540]  we have direct democracy the people rule it's not true as his image was
[03:15:06.540 --> 03:15:11.180]  everywhere people didn't smile people whispered you can tell when you're in
[03:15:11.180 --> 03:15:15.340]  the dictatorship but unfortunately the way America's going with with images of
[03:15:15.340 --> 03:15:19.580]  the government in the Palatano everywhere well absolutely and and I think with
[03:15:19.580 --> 03:15:24.500]  what happened in Tunisia and Egypt on both sides of Libya it was a foregone
[03:15:24.500 --> 03:15:30.020]  conclusion or would be a revolt there but I think the problem is that certain
[03:15:30.020 --> 03:15:35.060]  Western powers Britain France United States saw hey this is a chance to go in
[03:15:35.060 --> 03:15:38.340]  and grab the oil and that's exactly what Trump said we had to go in there and
[03:15:38.340 --> 03:15:41.740]  grab the oil well that's what that's what this is this is all about so people
[03:15:41.740 --> 03:15:45.460]  who might have been neutral on Gaddafi said well he may be a dictator but he's
[03:15:45.460 --> 03:15:49.380]  our dictator we saw the same thing play out in Iraq when they were invaded people
[03:15:49.380 --> 03:15:53.700]  might not have liked Saddam Hussein did you know come to the defense of Iraq
[03:15:53.700 --> 03:15:57.420]  because they're they're nationalists they're they want to protect their own
[03:15:57.420 --> 03:16:03.220]  country so we see well I mean it's the same thing the African also wants to
[03:16:03.220 --> 03:16:09.820]  use Libya as a base right Gaddafi is was building a huge international airport
[03:16:09.820 --> 03:16:14.380]  that was going to be the hub for Africa what a perfect place to stick Africa with
[03:16:14.380 --> 03:16:21.540]  a huge runway that can handle all kinds of aircraft and a hub for Africa and now
[03:16:21.540 --> 03:16:26.380]  we see of course these revolutions starting to spill south of the Sahara
[03:16:26.380 --> 03:16:31.100]  and you know other countries and I think this plays right into the
[03:16:31.100 --> 03:16:35.500]  african game plan to go in there well you've seen the same card with the
[03:16:35.500 --> 03:16:39.860]  French going into the Ivory Coast right never doing it for us I mean the
[03:16:39.860 --> 03:16:44.180]  French are basically this isn't the Characte France anymore this is
[03:16:44.180 --> 03:16:49.620]  Sarkozy France and he's basically not to you know use a cliche he's a he's our
[03:16:49.620 --> 03:16:53.100]  French poodle all right let's go ahead and talk to who Leo in Illinois we're
[03:16:53.100 --> 03:16:56.380]  gonna go to the bottom of the hour here with calls who Leo in Illinois you're
[03:16:56.380 --> 03:17:00.340]  on the air go ahead gentlemen good afternoon to the both of you happy
[03:17:00.340 --> 03:17:05.300]  Easter it's great to talk to true to true journalist history's gonna show that
[03:17:05.300 --> 03:17:10.300]  you guys were reporting the truth all along you guys are absolutely right
[03:17:10.300 --> 03:17:14.260]  hitting the nail on the coffin false flag will happen in Chicago I'm from
[03:17:14.260 --> 03:17:19.700]  Chicago I'm terrified you look at Bill Daley he's to work where JP Morgan Chase
[03:17:19.700 --> 03:17:23.820]  what's JP Morgan Chase's problem they're shorting the silver market silver is
[03:17:23.820 --> 03:17:28.940]  booming almost 550 in the Asian markets today I have a feeling once they're
[03:17:28.940 --> 03:17:33.740]  trying to speed up the Bogovitch retrial just so they can shut up with
[03:17:33.740 --> 03:17:38.700]  the boy of it because he truly can send Rahm Emanuel into deep trouble if that
[03:17:38.700 --> 03:17:42.220]  happens they're not even letting the boy of it defend himself play tapes or talk
[03:17:42.220 --> 03:17:47.180]  and I thought when you got one trial and it was hung jury you get off I guess
[03:17:47.180 --> 03:17:49.980]  they're gonna try them like over and over again Wayne oh absolutely they're
[03:17:49.980 --> 03:17:55.980]  there he wants to have played the 500 hours of wiretap information the judge
[03:17:55.980 --> 03:18:00.460]  is dirty James Zagel is a dirty judge the prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald is
[03:18:00.460 --> 03:18:05.460]  absolutely tainted he's very dirty is it goes back to the 93 World Trade Center
[03:18:05.460 --> 03:18:09.620]  people aren't dirty in Chicago the government's good in New York Fitzgerald
[03:18:09.620 --> 03:18:13.420]  but New York's not dirty either these are good people they are right but
[03:18:13.420 --> 03:18:18.140]  basically Fitzgerald is always you know I think he's probably got it also a
[03:18:18.140 --> 03:18:22.500]  background with the CIA because of the cover-up of critical evidence in the
[03:18:22.500 --> 03:18:26.380]  93 World Trade Center bombing and now he's sitting in Chicago as the as the
[03:18:26.380 --> 03:18:31.020]  US Attorney for Northern Illinois another guy we got to keep an eye on who's in a
[03:18:31.020 --> 03:18:34.140]  right place possibly at the right time those that don't know the feds cook the
[03:18:34.140 --> 03:18:37.420]  bomb train the driver and carried out the attack of the World Trade Center the
[03:18:37.420 --> 03:18:41.820]  first time right and and there were critical intercepts between the UN
[03:18:41.820 --> 03:18:45.820]  mission for Sudan and the foreign ministry of Sudan and cartoon that were
[03:18:45.820 --> 03:18:50.860]  never entered into evidence showing that in the 93 World Trade Center bombing
[03:18:50.860 --> 03:18:56.980]  Osama bin Laden was involved but because he was a CIA asset until 95 they didn't
[03:18:56.980 --> 03:19:00.780]  want to introduce that because they say what a CIA what was one of your guys
[03:19:00.780 --> 03:19:04.220]  doing involved in this so they played it on the blind shake and we're gonna skip
[03:19:04.220 --> 03:19:07.900]  this final break go all the way to 29 before we end this live transmission and
[03:19:07.900 --> 03:19:12.500]  go back into key retransmission thank you Julio Gary in Florida Gary you're on
[03:19:12.500 --> 03:19:19.140]  the air good afternoon gentlemen kudos to you Alex I love your documentaries thank
[03:19:19.140 --> 03:19:25.940]  you very informative but my besides uncovering the lies and the deception
[03:19:25.940 --> 03:19:30.780]  and the conning of conniving and all this when do we go into how can we go
[03:19:30.780 --> 03:19:35.180]  into action like we need indictments against these people first you're gonna
[03:19:35.180 --> 03:19:39.020]  take your states and your counties back and when you do stand up against this
[03:19:39.020 --> 03:19:42.940]  mafia a lot of times they'll kill you or sets you up so we need to get a lot of
[03:19:42.940 --> 03:19:47.340]  people angry and awake all putting it on the line so that there's too many
[03:19:47.340 --> 03:19:51.660]  targets and we just basically take the moral high ground expose these people
[03:19:51.660 --> 03:19:55.620]  to where the emperor has no clothes I mean like this royal wedding the emperor
[03:19:55.620 --> 03:19:58.340]  has no clothes they're a bunch of despots they're inviting a bunch of
[03:19:58.340 --> 03:20:03.220]  dictators over it's a celebration of evil and despotism and it's the same
[03:20:03.220 --> 03:20:09.660]  thing there we call it for what it is Wayne well I think so and I get back
[03:20:09.660 --> 03:20:14.460]  to the issue and during the Bush administration we turned out 300,000
[03:20:14.460 --> 03:20:19.300]  350,000 people in an award demonstration in Washington DC we had a recent one a
[03:20:19.300 --> 03:20:24.100]  couple a hundred maybe because you know what's disappeared well the Soros money
[03:20:24.100 --> 03:20:29.700]  doesn't go there anymore you know they the establishment Democratic money
[03:20:29.700 --> 03:20:33.140]  doesn't go and even back in those demonstrations very few elected
[03:20:33.140 --> 03:20:36.820]  Democratic officials would even show up those groups are all not just the
[03:20:36.820 --> 03:20:41.460]  they're all funded by Ford they're all funded by Soros the money's there for
[03:20:41.460 --> 03:20:46.820]  them not to do anything absolutely and so we see the Democrats saying well as
[03:20:46.820 --> 03:20:51.540]  long as it's a Republican in the White House we'll go out and protest but the
[03:20:51.540 --> 03:20:54.540]  minute there's a Democrat who's doing the same exact thing and some in some
[03:20:54.540 --> 03:20:59.540]  cases worse I mean Obama's got three official wars going on right now where
[03:20:59.540 --> 03:21:04.340]  Bush had two and we don't know Pakistan a covert they've been saying get the
[03:21:04.340 --> 03:21:09.220]  drones out absolutely so you know these these these are phonies these
[03:21:09.220 --> 03:21:12.900]  Democrats are phonies they call themselves progressives Soros gives a
[03:21:12.900 --> 03:21:17.220]  million dollars human rights watch human rights watch selects yeah they call
[03:21:17.220 --> 03:21:21.300]  Soros a communist but it's keep your friends close enemies closer it's all
[03:21:21.300 --> 03:21:26.060]  about controlling the left and the Republicans are about controlling the
[03:21:26.060 --> 03:21:30.180]  right and it's exactly what Rupert Murdoch does on the right wing side of
[03:21:30.180 --> 03:21:34.220]  the house with the you know Fox News and all the other media that he owns for
[03:21:34.220 --> 03:21:37.940]  decades saying there's no world government right when it was being built
[03:21:37.940 --> 03:21:43.580]  anything else caller alright he dropped off Deborah in Florida or Deborah in
[03:21:43.580 --> 03:21:48.900]  California you're on the air go ahead hi Alex I just want to thank you for
[03:21:48.900 --> 03:21:53.860]  waking me up two years ago been a member ever since God bless you and yours
[03:21:53.860 --> 03:22:00.780]  and Wayne Madsen I pray for your safe passage wherever you're gonna go I was
[03:22:00.780 --> 03:22:05.100]  born and raised in Chicago my father was an iron worker there usually ate his
[03:22:05.100 --> 03:22:10.220]  lunch about 80 stories above the city and love the joke about the Levitt store
[03:22:10.220 --> 03:22:17.460]  my question is this in Sudan that Sudan or deal that happened in 83 to 205 where
[03:22:17.460 --> 03:22:21.220]  they had to run for their lives to Kenya um is this what's happening in the
[03:22:21.220 --> 03:22:28.020]  Ivory Coast now and how much is the CIA or black ops in the ordeal with France
[03:22:28.020 --> 03:22:32.420]  and everything they admitted that they that the West is backing the rebels
[03:22:32.420 --> 03:22:36.420]  that murder thousands at a pop with machetes then they removed the one
[03:22:36.420 --> 03:22:39.900]  government put in the murderers it's just like Rwanda not like you were part of
[03:22:39.900 --> 03:22:43.620]  that war crimes tribunal right in Rwanda of course Clinton was present at the
[03:22:43.620 --> 03:22:48.380]  time and and there was a double assassination they shot down the
[03:22:48.380 --> 03:22:52.660]  airplane carrying the presidents of Rwanda and Burundi both ethnic Hutus
[03:22:52.660 --> 03:22:58.500]  and they're the dominant peoples in both countries and it was it was the
[03:22:58.500 --> 03:23:03.780]  central intelligence agency working with other groups in Rwanda that helped
[03:23:03.780 --> 03:23:07.900]  Kagami the current president our dictator in Rwanda shoot that plane down
[03:23:07.900 --> 03:23:13.460]  that triggered this huge civil war we know that Kagami himself was murdering
[03:23:13.460 --> 03:23:17.740]  his own Tutsis to make it look like oh look what these evil people are doing
[03:23:17.740 --> 03:23:22.380]  you know come you have to come to our assistance Clinton was just benign in
[03:23:22.380 --> 03:23:26.060]  the whole thing but the defense intelligence agency was very active in
[03:23:26.060 --> 03:23:30.300]  Rwanda Clinton says well we didn't know he knew he knew full well was going on
[03:23:30.300 --> 03:23:35.900]  over there by putting Kagami in we got rid of Mobutu and Zaire and then the
[03:23:35.900 --> 03:23:42.780]  Congo six million dead since the first invasion from Rwanda of Congo in the
[03:23:42.780 --> 03:23:48.540]  1990s mid 1990s and it's just gotten worse and worse and worse and Ivory
[03:23:48.540 --> 03:23:53.180]  Coast yes just like Sudan May 9th we get the new Republic of South Sudan
[03:23:53.180 --> 03:23:58.820]  independent country majority Christian Susan Rice our ambassador UN
[03:23:58.820 --> 03:24:03.180]  Obama's ambassador UN has always hated the government of Sudan she has been
[03:24:03.180 --> 03:24:09.380]  literally in bed with some of these rebel leaders in South Sudan she has a
[03:24:09.380 --> 03:24:14.580]  visceral hatred for the Arab North she is not a very good diplomat because all
[03:24:14.580 --> 03:24:19.740]  through Africa they know that she is totally biased and she's anything but a
[03:24:19.740 --> 03:24:24.660]  diplomat Ivory Coast you have the Alessandro Otero the rebel guy that took
[03:24:24.660 --> 03:24:28.500]  over said he won the election and you know he said no you know he well he said
[03:24:28.500 --> 03:24:32.660]  he won the election the incumbent said he didn't we had a civil war Alessandro
[03:24:32.660 --> 03:24:39.140]  Otero's wife is a French citizen very close to Sarkozy very close to the
[03:24:39.140 --> 03:24:43.140]  diamond business there are diamonds in Ivory Coast and this is what it's all
[03:24:43.140 --> 03:24:46.660]  about anybody tries to sell diamonds they call it blood diamonds blood the
[03:24:46.660 --> 03:24:51.580]  real blood diamonds are the ones sold to the Oppenheimer De Beers monopoly but
[03:24:51.580 --> 03:24:54.740]  then they call all the other diamonds they don't control in fact tomorrow in
[03:24:54.740 --> 03:24:58.140]  your own let's spend part of the interview getting into Africa because
[03:24:58.140 --> 03:25:02.940]  you've been a witness before the US House of Representatives but also the UN
[03:25:02.940 --> 03:25:07.500]  criminal tribunal for Rwanda and after the fact from my research it it's
[03:25:07.500 --> 03:25:12.620]  confirmed that the UN actually helped position some people to be massacred is
[03:25:12.620 --> 03:25:17.740]  that correct well the UN was in there with Belgian peacekeepers when the
[03:25:17.740 --> 03:25:22.100]  plane carrying the two presidents was shot down of course many of those
[03:25:22.100 --> 03:25:26.420]  Belgians were killed in retaliation but some of these Belgian peacekeepers were
[03:25:26.420 --> 03:25:33.100]  in proximity to where the Kagami forces the rebel forces were in a position to
[03:25:33.100 --> 03:25:37.580]  fire the shoulder-launched Sam missiles that took out the airplane you know the
[03:25:37.580 --> 03:25:41.060]  UN's never investigated that it was an international act of terrorism the
[03:25:41.060 --> 03:25:44.900]  French government investigated I testified before the French terrorism
[03:25:44.900 --> 03:25:49.860]  judge on that issue but the UN never and the US certainly doesn't never
[03:25:49.860 --> 03:25:53.100]  investigated why were you testifying on Africa why are you seeing as an expert
[03:25:53.100 --> 03:25:57.500]  well I wrote a book some years ago called genocide and covert operations in
[03:25:57.500 --> 03:26:02.380]  Africa 93 to 99 which took in this whole issue with the shooting down of the
[03:26:02.380 --> 03:26:05.980]  aircraft years later we found they said that well they couldn't find the black
[03:26:05.980 --> 03:26:11.780]  box the black box was found in a drawer at the UN headquarters in New York it
[03:26:11.780 --> 03:26:16.300]  had already been looked at by the FAA and the NTSB and what we know what they
[03:26:16.300 --> 03:26:23.060]  do in these cases they cover up and so it's quite clear that Africa is a
[03:26:23.060 --> 03:26:29.660]  playground for our nasty special ops people the private mercenary companies
[03:26:29.660 --> 03:26:32.980]  they've been in there for years all kinds of black waters just one of them
[03:26:32.980 --> 03:26:38.020]  there are many others US French I saw the beers in 99 a Newarker magazine
[03:26:38.020 --> 03:26:41.860]  bragging the world I'm a monopoly company for those that don't know that
[03:26:41.860 --> 03:26:46.260]  whenever a country tries to mine diamonds they just send in mercs well
[03:26:46.260 --> 03:26:53.260]  absolutely because the whole diamond trade is based on it's fairly recent it
[03:26:53.260 --> 03:26:56.860]  was it was artificial scarcity absolutely and and and you know it's
[03:26:56.860 --> 03:27:00.580]  always a wedding ring and you got to give a diamond wedding ring to somebody
[03:27:00.580 --> 03:27:04.660]  you're proposing to this this is this comes out of Marilyn Monroe breakfast
[03:27:04.660 --> 03:27:09.300]  breakfast at Tiffany's and all Hollywood created the mystique about diamonds
[03:27:09.300 --> 03:27:14.180]  only semi-pressure so they were sold to people as another Edward Bernays fraud
[03:27:14.180 --> 03:27:20.020]  absolutely and now there's effectively a monopoly with the beers and the the
[03:27:20.020 --> 03:27:24.540]  diamond cutters and antwerp Amsterdam Tel Aviv and increasingly we see some of
[03:27:24.540 --> 03:27:28.700]  that being outsourced the places like India and Bangkok Thailand because you
[03:27:28.700 --> 03:27:32.740]  know the diamond cutters in Europe charge too much in a way of salary so we
[03:27:32.740 --> 03:27:37.980]  even see in their own industry them outsourcing to these various developing
[03:27:37.980 --> 03:27:42.340]  countries totally unbelievable let's jam in a few more here Tariq and Georgia
[03:27:42.340 --> 03:27:45.020]  you're on the air
[03:27:45.740 --> 03:27:50.940]  hello yeah you're on the air go ahead oh hey how you doing I don't say no way good
[03:27:50.940 --> 03:27:55.700]  go ahead sir well I just want to give a couple of comments on Obama why I believe
[03:27:55.700 --> 03:28:00.900]  they put him in office I basically believe they put him in office just
[03:28:00.900 --> 03:28:04.380]  give you a little background I'm the third leader African-American male I was in
[03:28:04.380 --> 03:28:09.340]  the Navy for four years I've been out for four years now to honorable discharge I
[03:28:09.340 --> 03:28:14.020]  believe they put him in office dog basically shut black people up because
[03:28:14.020 --> 03:28:19.180]  anytime I anytime you say something bad about him it's like if you're white
[03:28:19.180 --> 03:28:24.740]  you're a racist and if you're black I hate it so it's like that double-edged
[03:28:24.740 --> 03:28:30.460]  sword and no no it's a way to inject identity politics to further divide and
[03:28:30.460 --> 03:28:34.860]  conquer and then give torture war and Wall Street looting left cover Wayne
[03:28:34.860 --> 03:28:40.540]  Matson well no I agree and I've spoken to many African-Americans from Chicago and
[03:28:40.540 --> 03:28:44.780]  Washington DC and if they agree with the caller Tariq from Georgia are these
[03:28:44.780 --> 03:28:49.260]  fake polls at 93% of blacks like him well who are they polling I think most of
[03:28:49.260 --> 03:28:52.140]  the polls are fake now you know it used to be that there were independent
[03:28:52.140 --> 03:28:56.180]  pollsters now look at the polling companies they're affiliated with the ABC
[03:28:56.180 --> 03:29:00.660]  news the Wall Street Journal the Washington Post these are corporate
[03:29:00.660 --> 03:29:04.580]  media entities so of course you know it's how they ask the questions who they
[03:29:04.580 --> 03:29:09.980]  ask the questions to I don't believe the polls the polls I think the polls are
[03:29:09.980 --> 03:29:15.100]  totally so let me ask Tariq this what amount of folks that you know who are
[03:29:15.100 --> 03:29:20.620]  African-American what amount of them really like Obama
[03:29:20.620 --> 03:29:27.060]  bad for Jordan especially the older ones which like I have I have friends that
[03:29:27.060 --> 03:29:31.340]  are like close to 60 and they believe them like they'll follow them to the
[03:29:31.340 --> 03:29:35.980]  grave of these things well that's that's what just like white people would follow
[03:29:35.980 --> 03:29:40.060]  George W. Bush to their grave it's this identity politics these guys are just
[03:29:40.060 --> 03:29:43.900]  puppets Tariq great point sorry to Ron Mike Tim and others we'll be back live
[03:29:43.900 --> 03:29:47.580]  tomorrow 11 a.m. Central and Wayne will be back in studio great job to the crew
[03:29:47.580 --> 03:29:52.220]  great job to Genesis God bless you all we're transmission starts now
