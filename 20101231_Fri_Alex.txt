[00:00.000 --> 00:11.340]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.340 --> 00:18.900]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:18.900 --> 00:28.620]  Texas Alex Jones here we are this is it it'll seem like five minutes from now
[00:28.620 --> 00:34.620]  we'll be doing the last radio broadcast of 2011 Lord willing but this is the
[00:34.620 --> 00:44.120]  last live radio transmission that I'll be doing in the year 2010 2010 is
[00:44.120 --> 00:49.720]  collapsing into dust he's got a very long beard and his teeth are falling out
[00:49.720 --> 00:55.080]  right in front of us and he is now becoming see-through and breaking into
[00:55.080 --> 01:01.580]  blocks of ash that are hitting the ground out with the old in with the new
[01:01.580 --> 01:07.900]  you know what are dates I mean they are just markers we use a signpost in our
[01:07.900 --> 01:12.740]  life but it is important just to illustrate how transitory life is and
[01:12.740 --> 01:18.220]  how special it is to to be alive and to be conscious in God's great creation
[01:18.220 --> 01:22.320]  we're gonna be live here today for the next four hours we have dr. Paul Craig
[01:22.320 --> 01:28.160]  Roberts he's been writing some really powerful news reports and he's gonna be
[01:28.160 --> 01:31.040]  joining us on the state of the police state the state of the awakening that's
[01:31.040 --> 01:38.440]  taking place the fact that 1984 has now arrived here in the Republic and we're
[01:38.440 --> 01:42.760]  gonna get into the economy as well with the father of Reaganomics former head of
[01:42.760 --> 01:47.520]  policy at the Department of Treasury and then our once a week visit I was out of
[01:47.520 --> 01:50.040]  town last week so I wouldn't hear since it's been two weeks since we've had the
[01:50.040 --> 01:55.560]  pleasure of talking to Bob Chapman of the International Forecaster he's gonna
[01:55.560 --> 02:00.060]  be on with us today we've also got some surprise guest popping in in the
[02:00.060 --> 02:09.880]  overdrive fourth hour today I want to come back from break and really just
[02:09.880 --> 02:15.800]  throw out some of the most important things that I think have happened in the
[02:15.800 --> 02:26.200]  last year and what we are facing going into 2011 here in about 12 hours eastern
[02:26.200 --> 02:39.400]  so 13 hour central I guess it's 15 hours Pacific but why am I obsessing on fact
[02:39.400 --> 02:46.240]  to age the point is that this is a very important broadcast obviously because it's
[02:46.240 --> 02:50.680]  always important to take stock of the year past and looking forward into the
[02:50.680 --> 02:55.240]  year to come and I tried to write some notes this morning of all the important
[02:55.240 --> 03:00.080]  things that have happened in 2010 and it just made my mind spin so what I'm gonna
[03:00.080 --> 03:07.800]  do is I'm gonna open the phones up throughout the full four hours today I'm
[03:07.800 --> 03:12.600]  gonna open the phones up throughout the full four hours today interspersed with
[03:12.600 --> 03:18.760]  the guest we've got coming on on one big issue one topic we don't screen your
[03:18.760 --> 03:22.400]  calls but every few weeks I'll say hey will you please call in on this topic
[03:22.400 --> 03:26.440]  or call in for this guest with specific questions for him and people of course
[03:26.440 --> 03:30.480]  hardly ever follow that rule and we can be talking about fluoridation of water
[03:30.480 --> 03:37.240]  they call in want to talk about the price of tea in China but this is easy for
[03:37.240 --> 03:42.880]  you to follow today I want to hear what you think the most important developments
[03:42.880 --> 03:48.720]  were in 2010 and what you think is going to happen in 2011 coming up so that is
[03:48.720 --> 03:53.240]  just basically a full spectrum anything you want to discuss you can but in that
[03:53.240 --> 03:57.280]  context I want to hear from you because I know there's no way that I can even
[03:57.280 --> 04:01.080]  remember or chronicle or keep track of all the important things that have
[04:01.080 --> 04:05.720]  happened it almost does an injustice if I come back from break and tell you what
[04:05.720 --> 04:14.120]  I think is important that happened in 2010 because there's no way to list what's
[04:14.120 --> 04:17.960]  most important up front so I'll just cover the smattering of ideas I've got
[04:17.960 --> 04:23.320]  when we return there's also been some really amazing draconian developments
[04:23.320 --> 04:30.400]  that we were expecting but still it's really hard to deal with it when it's
[04:30.400 --> 04:33.320]  unfolding I mean it's one thing to know it's coming it's something to know that
[04:33.320 --> 04:36.800]  it's actually here and one thing to know a bus is about to hit you it's another
[04:36.800 --> 04:41.640]  thing once you feel it actually run into you feel your bones break so a lot of
[04:41.640 --> 04:46.480]  serious things have happened in 2010 the good the bad the ugly and as we look
[04:46.480 --> 04:54.240]  forward to 2011 if folks think 2010 was wild and woolly get ready 2011 into
[04:54.240 --> 05:01.320]  2012 it's gonna be a roller coaster stay with us this is Alex Jones with five
[05:01.320 --> 05:05.560]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[05:05.560 --> 05:09.360]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[05:09.360 --> 05:13.680]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[05:13.680 --> 05:18.080]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[05:18.080 --> 05:22.560]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[05:22.560 --> 05:27.280]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.280 --> 05:31.080]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.080 --> 05:34.720]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:34.720 --> 05:39.080]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.080 --> 05:42.200]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[05:42.200 --> 05:45.920]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[05:45.920 --> 05:50.680]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar
[05:50.680 --> 05:54.960]  backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to my solar
[05:54.960 --> 06:02.880]  backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365 hundreds of nations have fallen to
[06:02.880 --> 06:07.600]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive
[06:07.600 --> 06:11.840]  history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from
[06:11.840 --> 06:15.800]  underneath Americans at home I've turned many same influence on our
[06:15.800 --> 06:20.040]  president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[06:20.040 --> 06:25.240]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention fall the
[06:25.240 --> 06:29.840]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel
[06:29.840 --> 06:34.200]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[06:34.200 --> 06:37.960]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[06:37.960 --> 06:41.880]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[06:41.880 --> 06:47.440]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[06:47.440 --> 06:53.600]  the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars.com we're

[07:04.560 --> 07:09.280]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[07:09.280 --> 07:13.200]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[07:13.200 --> 07:17.080]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[07:17.080 --> 07:22.040]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[07:22.040 --> 07:27.320]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[07:27.320 --> 07:31.920]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[07:31.920 --> 07:36.120]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[07:36.120 --> 07:41.040]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow

[08:04.440 --> 08:11.920]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[08:11.920 --> 08:19.440]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[08:19.440 --> 08:27.360]  alex jones we're gonna be live for four hours it is the final live transmission
[08:27.360 --> 08:35.760]  of 2010 as we go into 2011 2012 and beyond we're gonna have open phones to
[08:35.760 --> 08:40.560]  get your take on what you think the most important developments of 2010 have
[08:40.560 --> 08:45.640]  been not so much the biggest news stories you know who got a tummy tuck or
[08:45.640 --> 08:51.560]  who got a nose job or who OD or you know oh my gosh well they may cancel some
[08:51.560 --> 08:55.680]  NFL football games I know for the brain dead zombies that's the most important
[08:55.680 --> 09:02.080]  stories of 2010 no obviously there's the banking implosion there's the tyranny
[09:02.080 --> 09:06.920]  coming out in the open there's the mass awakening to the private Federal Reserve
[09:06.920 --> 09:12.360]  in 2010 there's the admissions by the government of geoengineering climate
[09:12.360 --> 09:16.840]  manipulation weather warfare they're waging against us that's going on right
[09:16.840 --> 09:23.320]  now there is the global unraveling of the dollar that happened last year I
[09:23.320 --> 09:26.400]  mean there are just hundreds of things that have gone on there was the huge
[09:26.400 --> 09:31.960]  ongoing TSA scandal that really is galvanizing people more and more to face
[09:31.960 --> 09:36.120]  the fact that this is real tyranny and the people of the United States and
[09:36.120 --> 09:40.760]  other countries that have a similar management system going in are really
[09:40.760 --> 09:44.120]  waking up and saying this is about dominating us and training us to be
[09:44.120 --> 09:48.680]  slaves and getting in our comfort zone I even have the London Guardian today and
[09:48.680 --> 09:53.160]  Washington Post and other big publications coming out and attacking
[09:53.160 --> 09:57.600]  the TSA and saying it's wrong and that it's molestation and that it's tyranny
[09:57.600 --> 10:03.640]  I mean there are big things happening here's the Guardian the TSA's state
[10:03.640 --> 10:10.760]  mandated molestation the humiliations of the Pat down policy with Janet de
[10:10.760 --> 10:16.200]  Palatano wants to expand are an Orwellian assault on American freedom and I
[10:16.200 --> 10:23.840]  can't even read on air what the TSA is admitting because of a child's audience
[10:23.840 --> 10:28.480]  but we've not made jokes some have made jokes it's not a joke here that they
[10:28.480 --> 10:34.240]  will start doing proctology cavity searches and of course many reporters
[10:34.240 --> 10:37.960]  people couldn't believe it months ago we were covering it it happened to female
[10:37.960 --> 10:40.840]  reporters and male reporters where they put their hands on your genitals and
[10:40.840 --> 10:46.120]  press hard I mean it hurts people now they're well I'm not gonna through the
[10:46.120 --> 10:49.840]  pants or they go into the pants they're going I'm not gonna get into it you can
[10:49.840 --> 10:55.040]  you can put you you can read you can read the Guardian article this is the
[10:55.040 --> 10:59.480]  biggest newspaper not just in England but in Europe and it sounds like Paul
[10:59.480 --> 11:04.800]  Watson wrote it or Kurt Nemo or Alex Jones okay because you see you got to be
[11:04.800 --> 11:10.360]  careful with tyranny as they based people in it as they marinate you as they
[11:10.360 --> 11:15.760]  take you to new lows of degradation in the name of keeping you safe as they
[11:15.760 --> 11:20.280]  try to set insane precedents by doing radical things that's the Overton
[11:20.280 --> 11:27.920]  window as they do that instead of just getting you to fully submit if they push
[11:27.920 --> 11:31.800]  too hard it can cause you to buck and finally wake up it's kind of like to
[11:31.800 --> 11:36.240]  use the analogy of a vampire if it sneaks up in the night and you know sucking
[11:36.240 --> 11:39.640]  some blood gently you might not wake up but if it just comes right over and
[11:39.640 --> 11:43.200]  sinks its teeth in and starts really sucking hard you might wake up and try
[11:43.200 --> 11:51.360]  to fight off the Nosferatu police state the Count Dracula police state and
[11:51.360 --> 11:58.320]  that's what's happening here so the trance really you can say was broken in
[11:58.320 --> 12:04.120]  2010 for many people the the biggest acceleration of awakening that this
[12:04.120 --> 12:08.160]  planet's ever seen and Zbigniew Brzezinski said that in 2010 all of
[12:08.160 --> 12:12.360]  humanity is awake and staring at the political rulers at the people behind
[12:12.360 --> 12:17.320]  the throne the engineers that's a problem for them as Lou Rockwell said
[12:17.320 --> 12:21.040]  eloquently yesterday once you're not looking at Bush the puppet or Obama the
[12:21.040 --> 12:25.360]  puppet though they are distasteful teleprompter reading creatures and once
[12:25.360 --> 12:30.760]  you start looking at the central banks the made-off types the Ken lay types the
[12:30.760 --> 12:39.640]  you know Keating five types this is Keating five you know point ten version
[12:39.640 --> 12:44.000]  ten version 20 version 10,000 I don't know pick your version it just gets
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.480]  worse and more off the charts and if they can just make you just lackadaisy
[12:48.480 --> 12:54.160]  Lee I don't care I'm gonna go get drunk they win and you get a Nazi Germany you
[12:54.160 --> 12:58.800]  get a Soviet Russia you get a Maoist China but we can reverse that as decadent
[12:58.800 --> 13:02.200]  and slob like as we've all become and even if you're in perfect shape
[13:02.200 --> 13:08.360]  culturally we become slovenly lazy when we're none of us are one-tenth as hard
[13:08.360 --> 13:14.680]  as people were 150 years ago there's no doubt about that we become disconnected
[13:14.680 --> 13:19.600]  from reality disconnected from the earth disconnected from blood sweat and
[13:19.600 --> 13:24.240]  toil and where if you didn't put enough food away for the winter you and your
[13:24.240 --> 13:32.080]  family starved death people become domesticated well the trance was broken
[13:32.080 --> 13:37.400]  to a great extent in 2010 it dwarfs all the previous years combined I mean it's
[13:37.400 --> 13:45.440]  the big awakening will we supercharge it will we grasp the wheel of destiny and
[13:45.440 --> 13:50.840]  put our imprint our will into this this great contest there's always been a
[13:50.840 --> 13:54.400]  contest even if you don't believe in God and the devil there's always been a
[13:54.400 --> 14:00.920]  contest between control freaks thugs abusers sadists psychopaths that create
[14:00.920 --> 14:04.640]  systems of domination and control to carry out their fantasies of total
[14:04.640 --> 14:10.480]  enslavement that's a fact of humanity it's like a tropism you put plant a seed
[14:10.480 --> 14:15.080]  water and sunlight hit it it gets nutrients it sprouts it comes up the
[14:15.080 --> 14:21.440]  plant aims towards the sun it's a tropism and it's the same thing with the
[14:21.440 --> 14:26.120]  globalist black uniforms mass death raping wars burning cities it's it's
[14:26.120 --> 14:30.840]  it's what the psychopath creates when they get control and they always get
[14:30.840 --> 14:35.480]  control by staging events and posing as your savior and paying people off and
[14:35.480 --> 14:41.480]  creating armies of corrupt people to serve them they always find key units
[14:41.480 --> 14:47.360]  of murderers to then expand who will then recruit other murderers other control
[14:47.360 --> 14:52.120]  freaks I mean we know exactly what this does it's like if you go to the doctor
[14:52.120 --> 14:55.280]  and they say you got this type of brain tumor it grows this fast you're gonna be
[14:55.280 --> 15:03.080]  dead within six months it's a hundred percent goodbye run out in front of an
[15:03.080 --> 15:06.880]  18-wheeler that's going a hundred miles an hour it's you're gonna die I mean we
[15:06.880 --> 15:12.040]  know what this does okay I mean it's like hanging a big old side of rotten
[15:12.040 --> 15:15.680]  pork over a boat and throwing rotten chicken blood in and a big old great
[15:15.680 --> 15:19.600]  white shark comes up and it's jaws open up and right as you see its jaws going
[15:19.600 --> 15:25.080]  over that you know rotten side of pork that hog you mean you know those teeth
[15:25.080 --> 15:28.960]  are gonna in size in and it's gonna jerk a big old chunk of meat off I mean
[15:28.960 --> 15:33.600]  it's not rocket science I just want to get this across to people and we've got
[15:33.600 --> 15:39.480]  the worst case and the most scientific sickening gibbering bloodthirsty case
[15:39.480 --> 15:44.320]  of tyranny I've ever studied and we're not studying something now in history
[15:44.320 --> 15:51.400]  books it's on us right now we're under attack and it's 2010 that people really
[15:51.400 --> 15:59.280]  started to get it and again I'm not bragging when I talk about my personal
[15:59.280 --> 16:07.920]  experiences it's the best gauge I've got I can fly into any city in the western
[16:07.920 --> 16:14.400]  world I can go into Latin America I can go to Europe I can fly into Los Angeles
[16:14.400 --> 16:22.960]  New York City Minneapolis Minnesota I can go anywhere and it's not every 20
[16:22.960 --> 16:28.880]  people that stop and shake my hand now it's 30 40% it's gotten to the point if
[16:28.880 --> 16:34.800]  I go see a movie I can hardly go to the bathroom and come back without being
[16:34.800 --> 16:40.760]  stopped a dozen times now the New World Order knows that they're tracking
[16:40.760 --> 16:45.240]  everything their spy on everybody they know Liberty is incredibly popular and
[16:45.240 --> 16:50.800]  the last domino to fall the people are awake now to a great extent there's
[16:50.800 --> 16:54.880]  still hordes that are zombies and you're not gonna be able to help them they
[16:54.880 --> 16:58.480]  don't count unfortunately I wish they did but they're not in the equation
[16:58.480 --> 17:11.480]  their spectators being run over but in 2010 the trance was broken the people
[17:11.480 --> 17:17.440]  realized that they were under attack but now they're just discovering just how
[17:17.440 --> 17:24.280]  serious that attack is and the last domino to fall and it's beginning to tip
[17:24.280 --> 17:29.720]  and if we just all put our effort into it in little ways with even little steps
[17:29.720 --> 17:35.480]  every day many hands make light work that domino is going down now the global
[17:35.480 --> 17:39.280]  is going to try to start World War three and set off nukes I mean they're
[17:39.280 --> 17:45.480]  capable of anything and I see in my mind's eye mega terror if we don't expose
[17:45.480 --> 17:50.080]  them and talk about it then we take that tool away but there's no doubt they've
[17:50.080 --> 17:57.280]  got really bad stuff locked cocked ready to go but the last domino to fall this
[17:57.280 --> 18:05.360]  is so important is that most people who are awake still think they are the
[18:05.360 --> 18:14.320]  minority and that's the last domino I'd have to say 60% the polls show this
[18:14.320 --> 18:18.640]  Congress has a 13 to 9 percentage approval depending on which major
[18:18.640 --> 18:23.040]  scientific poll you look at 9 to 13 what's the difference lowest in history
[18:23.040 --> 18:29.280]  still plunging Obama lowest in history plunging people the Republicans made
[18:29.280 --> 18:31.880]  compromises with the Democrats because they're bought and paid for by the same
[18:31.880 --> 18:35.800]  interest now now conservatives are going completely ape there's no honeymoon
[18:35.800 --> 18:44.880]  with that scum it's very exciting but still 60% or more are awake now but they
[18:44.880 --> 18:48.480]  just it's like you wake up in the dark of the night and you kind of forget where
[18:48.480 --> 18:51.560]  you're at or what room you ever wake up at a hotel when you're out of town you
[18:51.560 --> 18:54.480]  kind of wake up thinking you're in your own home you go that you know that's
[18:54.480 --> 19:02.240]  right I'm in I'm in Galveston Texas oh I'm in Los Angeles who I'm in New York
[19:02.240 --> 19:09.840]  I'm in DC who I'm in Toronto I'm in London so people have woken up but
[19:09.840 --> 19:14.320]  they're in the dark now that they're awake we that are more informed at a
[19:14.320 --> 19:17.880]  higher level have got to bring them up to the next level now that they're awake
[19:17.880 --> 19:22.280]  in the dark we got a strike a match and go it's global tyranny it's happened in
[19:22.280 --> 19:25.760]  history it's happening again here's what's happening here's who they are
[19:25.760 --> 19:30.400]  here's a film here's a link to a radio show here's a book here's some
[19:30.400 --> 19:37.000]  information and again it's a process they won't immediately go out and kick
[19:37.000 --> 19:40.280]  the new world or signed in but they will start growing and then as the
[19:40.280 --> 19:44.840]  oppression gets worse they'll now see it all as confirmation of what you told
[19:44.840 --> 19:50.480]  them I can feel the energy of humanity shifting I can feel the destiny of

[24:48.040 --> 24:53.400]  this it starts out with a few body scanners and then old scanners are

[25:06.400 --> 25:10.840]  that's it's all about the studying of their prey the ruling class sees us as
[25:10.840 --> 25:15.280]  animals and so it's all about the rollout and it's also about the

[25:36.920 --> 25:42.920]  warrants we don't need no stinking badges some of the big developments I'm
[25:42.920 --> 25:49.720]  gonna come back from break start going to your phone calls Obama's people
[25:49.720 --> 25:55.720]  announced earlier this week that they are indeed gonna have the EPA start in
[25:55.720 --> 25:59.920]  the locales with grants with the home inspections and the harassment of the
[25:59.920 --> 26:04.720]  farms and ranches and it's all in the news today they're gonna go ahead with
[26:04.720 --> 26:08.280]  the global carbon taxes California went ahead and put that into place they're
[26:08.280 --> 26:13.840]  not gonna phase in a 20% tax basically on all human activity of course China
[26:13.840 --> 26:18.440]  India Mexico they have to make zero cuts you thought your jobs left the country
[26:18.440 --> 26:23.760]  already whatever's left is going to go real fast because it's designed to
[26:23.760 --> 26:28.200]  deindustrialize us and that's not my opinion that's on record post industrial
[26:28.200 --> 26:33.080]  society morey strong you and David Rockefeller the head climatologist at
[26:33.080 --> 26:36.880]  NASA I mean this is their policy that ahead of the transportation department
[26:36.880 --> 26:43.560]  in 2010 the back in January told the Wall Street Journal said absolutely we're
[26:43.560 --> 26:49.000]  anti-car we do want you out of your cars they build the society on cars with
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.840]  sprawling separated cities and urban centers then they start squeezing we
[26:53.840 --> 26:57.760]  told you a few weeks ago three weeks ago or I guess more than that a few months
[26:57.760 --> 27:01.520]  ago with Lindsay Williams he said that three months ago first that it was gonna
[27:01.520 --> 27:06.000]  be going up to 150 a barrel now they had a Dutch World Shell says that's right
[27:06.000 --> 27:15.080]  150 200 a barrel in the next year $5 a gallon gas but it's all part of the
[27:15.080 --> 27:20.600]  lawlessness see their lawless that's the Overton window people send me emails say
[27:20.600 --> 27:22.760]  why did Glenn Beck call his book the Overton window well that's a
[27:22.760 --> 27:27.200]  psychological perspective that just print me the Wikipedia example of that
[27:27.200 --> 27:32.240]  I should read the technical term for it but the Overton window deals with a
[27:32.240 --> 27:36.600]  political window and you've got in the false left right paradigm the left and
[27:36.600 --> 27:41.600]  the right and if you want to really condition people to accept what you
[27:41.600 --> 27:47.600]  want them to do even though it's radical you ask for a million miles on the left
[27:47.600 --> 27:52.680]  just super extreme knowing that they're gonna struggle and fight you but then
[27:52.680 --> 27:57.200]  think that they've had a victory when they only push you back 500,000 miles so
[27:57.200 --> 28:01.280]  it's the old they take two steps and then you fight and only push them a foot
[28:01.280 --> 28:05.640]  back and they take ten steps and you push them seven feet back but still
[28:05.640 --> 28:09.440]  they've now gained four feet then they push it a hundred feet you push them
[28:09.440 --> 28:15.560]  back eighty feet but now they've got see this is how they do it I mean it's
[28:15.560 --> 28:20.320]  bold and wild in just a space of three months to go from we're gonna squeeze
[28:20.320 --> 28:25.680]  your genitals through your pants to we're gonna go in your pants see they
[28:25.680 --> 28:28.840]  don't care now if you know they take your baby's blood secretly at birth and
[28:28.840 --> 28:33.360]  that they lied about it for decades because they're moving against you they
[28:33.360 --> 28:40.160]  want to be so radical and so extreme that you just go into a catatonic state
[28:40.160 --> 28:44.320]  the Overton window was a political theory described as a window in the range
[28:44.320 --> 28:48.920]  of public reactions to ideas in public discourse and a spectrum of all possible
[28:48.920 --> 28:53.000]  opinions on a particular issue it is named after its originator Joseph P
[28:53.000 --> 29:01.560]  Overton former vice president of the Mechanics Center for Public Policy at
[29:01.560 --> 29:05.600]  any given moment the window includes a range of policies considered to be
[29:05.600 --> 29:09.640]  politically acceptable in the current climate of public opinion which a
[29:09.640 --> 29:14.160]  politician can recommend without being considered too extreme or outside the
[29:14.160 --> 29:19.960]  mainstream to keep or gain public office Overton arranged the spectrum on a
[29:19.960 --> 29:24.720]  virtual axis of more free or less free in regards of government intervention
[29:24.720 --> 29:28.800]  when the window moves or expands ideas can accordingly become more or less
[29:28.800 --> 29:33.440]  politically acceptable the degree of acceptance of public ideas can be
[29:33.440 --> 29:39.680]  described roughly as unthinkable radical acceptable sensible popular policy and
[29:39.680 --> 29:44.440]  so they say yeah we're putting floor on your water next is lithium and you know
[29:44.440 --> 29:48.280]  what we are doing it to hurt you it's good humans are bad we've been

[32:11.480 --> 32:15.760]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[32:15.760 --> 32:20.120]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[32:20.120 --> 32:24.160]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[32:24.160 --> 32:28.760]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[32:28.760 --> 32:32.880]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[33:20.160 --> 33:35.840]  Texas broadcasting worldwide it's Alex Jones where people 50 years ago would
[33:35.840 --> 33:39.440]  have thought it was insane and wouldn't have put up with it to have cities all
[33:39.440 --> 33:43.680]  over the country first banning BB guns now they're banning I have several
[33:43.680 --> 33:51.840]  articles here in in major cities nerf guns see first on key reservations where
[33:51.840 --> 33:57.800]  they have children where the children haven't had their parents teach them
[33:57.800 --> 34:01.800]  their morals and where they've been raised by the television they can then
[34:01.800 --> 34:06.280]  mirror that propaganda in the school and they can get away with things that
[34:06.280 --> 34:12.560]  adults would think of as extreme and crazy like arresting small children for
[34:12.560 --> 34:17.800]  their GI Joe toy in their lunchbox because they have a 3 centimeter pistol
[34:17.800 --> 34:23.760]  in their hand or arresting someone because they have a plastic butter knife to
[34:23.760 --> 34:31.200]  put butter on their bread this is happening every week or so I see it in
[34:31.200 --> 34:37.520]  the news that is also creating a cadre under the peer pressure of government
[34:37.520 --> 34:42.720]  control and the union teachers who will do anything and and think that tyranny
[34:42.720 --> 34:48.080]  is normal and I use this example a lot but if you went back and I've studied
[34:48.080 --> 34:51.800]  Mesoamerica thousands and thousands of years ago four or five thousand years
[34:51.800 --> 34:57.240]  ago there was very little human sacrifice going on in Peru and what's
[34:57.240 --> 35:03.560]  Guatemala today and what's Mexico today but as more and more radical war-like
[35:03.560 --> 35:07.520]  tribes got in control by the time Cortez showed up five hundred and something
[35:07.520 --> 35:14.920]  years ago it was just insane asylum hundreds of sacrifices a day per city
[35:14.920 --> 35:20.560]  on some holidays 10 plus thousand giant meat markets of human flesh that's how
[35:20.560 --> 35:24.480]  the priest class funded themselves the main meat was human meat and so you'd
[35:24.480 --> 35:27.200]  go into the market and they were selling all the different cutlets of men
[35:27.200 --> 35:32.200]  women and children and if you went up and it could speak a Mayan to one of
[35:32.200 --> 35:36.960]  those tribes to the Aztecs who spoke Mayan those mine sub route culture and
[35:36.960 --> 35:41.840]  you said this is wrong they think you were nuts they'd laugh at you so see
[35:41.840 --> 35:46.360]  they've moved the window so far that it's radical that I don't want to ban
[35:46.360 --> 35:52.320]  nerf toys see they've already got the young generation ready for that and
[35:52.320 --> 35:58.200]  soon they'll be the adults and kids are raised by television where every show is
[35:58.200 --> 36:01.520]  you know set in New York or Chicago where guns are banned and where they see
[36:01.520 --> 36:05.120]  simulated cop shows where they're arresting people for owning guns and
[36:05.120 --> 36:09.600]  so when the TV head comes in your house to clean your carpet or put in a
[36:09.600 --> 36:13.520]  telephone line and they didn't come from a rural area and they see a gun case
[36:13.520 --> 36:19.400]  they call the cops on you and the cops respond and the juries are so dumb
[36:19.400 --> 36:23.600]  people go to prison all the time for legal guns in their house I see that
[36:23.600 --> 36:28.280]  every week or so as well that's an example of just mass mental illness
[36:28.280 --> 36:33.800]  Hitler was able by degree to demonize certain groups and people until the
[36:33.800 --> 36:36.640]  Germans were ready to do whatever they were told same thing with the Soviets
[36:36.640 --> 36:41.000]  when you're purely driven by peer pressure and you've got tyrannical
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.200]  scientific dictatorship the sky's the limit I'm going to your calls I just
[36:46.200 --> 36:55.400]  wanted to get into this because on every front they are transforming us into the
[36:55.400 --> 37:01.800]  opposite of what is archetypal freedom they are transferring us into archetypal
[37:01.800 --> 37:05.800]  tyranny a lot of writers even in mainstream news keep saying it's as if
[37:05.800 --> 37:11.120]  the government is trying to recreate 1984 it's as if it's a training manual
[37:11.120 --> 37:15.840]  Hillary Clinton says it's her favorite book and notice what she tries to create
[37:15.840 --> 37:23.520]  she for the tyrants the answer to 1776 is 1984 from their perspective that's
[37:23.520 --> 37:28.200]  what they want and jaren made the joke during the break that it's like party
[37:28.200 --> 37:33.120]  like it's 1984 and we somebody should create a parody showing TSA searching
[37:33.120 --> 37:39.120]  people and chemtrails and cameras and blood draws and but then government can
[37:39.120 --> 37:42.640]  engage in all the corruption they want and so when you see Supreme Court
[37:42.640 --> 37:46.280]  justices saying we're gonna follow you in law and the Constitution doesn't matter
[37:46.280 --> 37:51.080]  in USA today Ruth Bader Ginsburg and others I've seen four of the of the nine
[37:51.080 --> 37:54.880]  mint comments like that when you see judges on a routine basis saying I
[37:54.880 --> 37:58.160]  don't have the Constitution in my courtroom just search that you'll see it
[37:58.160 --> 38:02.240]  over and over again that's a talking point Colorado Texas you name it I
[38:02.240 --> 38:07.800]  don't allow the Constitution in my courtroom when you see all these
[38:07.800 --> 38:11.920]  different congressmen in 2010 say I don't care about the Constitution I don't
[38:11.920 --> 38:16.280]  care we've played those videos in time constraints I'm not gonna play them now
[38:16.280 --> 38:19.840]  because I want to get to some of your calls so when Ezra Klein Washington
[38:19.840 --> 38:24.520]  post staffer and he's also a staffer in MSNBC goes on a show and says
[38:24.520 --> 38:29.920]  Constitution doesn't matter see people kept thinking the Democrats and
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.880]  Republicans well the Democrats last year tried over and over again to pass
[38:34.880 --> 38:39.760]  spending bills that originated in the Senate totally illegal totally against
[38:39.760 --> 38:44.480]  the Constitution but they they've tried to do it and in some cases they've gotten
[38:44.480 --> 38:49.840]  bills through that were spending bills out of the Senate see they're setting
[38:49.840 --> 38:56.680]  the precedent when goon cops who were in a brainwashed system themselves in the
[38:56.680 --> 39:00.480]  Overton window who've been conditioned and trained to accept all of this when
[39:00.480 --> 39:06.320]  they come up or even security guards that's happened to my crew and myself
[39:06.320 --> 39:13.560]  Kansas City star covered it the videos on YouTube Aaron and Rob Jacobson are a
[39:13.560 --> 39:17.760]  half mile away from the Federal Reserve they're across the street on the side of
[39:17.760 --> 39:22.960]  a highway videotaping they're done they drive down to a World War one memorial
[39:22.960 --> 39:27.720]  they're on the side of a city street on a sidewalk off their jurisdiction in
[39:27.720 --> 39:34.680]  black uniforms to federal security guards with sidearms walked up and said I'm
[39:34.680 --> 39:39.200]  ordering you to leave they said well you're sitting your jurisdiction we
[39:39.200 --> 39:44.080]  even if you were a cop you if you're outside your authority and they put
[39:44.080 --> 39:51.240]  their hand on their guns and they said look I'm gonna arrest you and maybe
[39:51.240 --> 39:54.440]  they should have gotten arrested but I've told them unless they personally want
[39:54.440 --> 39:58.760]  to do it don't I probably would but I've told them you know my order is to
[39:58.760 --> 40:02.720]  just get it on tape illustrate it and get out of there and when they said okay
[40:02.720 --> 40:07.640]  we'll go the man and woman security guards literally look like Satan you
[40:07.640 --> 40:10.840]  could see them it looked like Emperor Palpatine when he does something evil
[40:10.840 --> 40:16.360]  he'll he'll crimp his lips with pleasure and go mmm it's just mmm and I saw the
[40:16.360 --> 40:20.840]  cops do that in Austin when my guys were on a city road on the back of the
[40:20.840 --> 40:24.920]  airport videotaping people going through with just a swipe card to
[40:24.920 --> 40:28.040]  illustrate how it's all a fraud with security same thing they rated the
[40:28.040 --> 40:33.000]  pilot for showing and showing how it's a fraud first nice cop gets there but
[40:33.000 --> 40:37.840]  still puts them in a database and I know you got a right but give me your ID let
[40:37.840 --> 40:42.400]  me just run you know see he's the nice he's the nice Gestapo and then others
[40:42.400 --> 40:46.400]  show up and say I don't care if you've got a right get out of here I'm gonna
[40:46.400 --> 40:51.920]  arrest you and when they said okay we'll go you see the cops just mmm good good
[40:51.920 --> 40:56.720]  that cop doesn't know that they're literally knocking the floor out from
[40:56.720 --> 41:03.200]  themselves and their family they have no idea they think they're winning they
[41:03.200 --> 41:06.360]  think they've got some type of personal power through the system let's play
[41:06.360 --> 41:16.080]  this clip as recline Constitution has no binding power on anything and again
[41:16.080 --> 41:20.480]  they say this over and over again and they know it's radical to say if you
[41:20.480 --> 41:23.240]  don't want government-run health care you don't like black people it has
[41:23.240 --> 41:27.120]  nothing to do with anything it's bizarre it's crazy it's nonsensical but
[41:27.120 --> 41:31.760]  they're practicing doing that just to make it la la land this is all in
[41:31.760 --> 41:36.280]  handbooks by these people now here's the good news we're taking the overton
[41:36.280 --> 41:40.240]  window back to reality we're saying yeah you blew up those towers we're bold we
[41:40.240 --> 41:43.480]  don't care if you demonize us yeah we're gonna cover the government nerve
[41:43.480 --> 41:46.320]  gas on our own troops and shooting little kids up the syphilis and now
[41:46.320 --> 41:50.320]  you're a bunch of murderers and they're like no no don't do that yeah we're
[41:50.320 --> 41:54.040]  gonna do that and they're like well we might get you we'll just death threat
[41:54.040 --> 41:57.920]  your wife and surveil you and call you up and let you know we're watching you
[41:57.920 --> 42:01.200]  and tell you stuff that proves we're the government and we'll have guys assault
[42:01.200 --> 42:04.640]  you in a parking lot we'll have military threaten you and you know what when you
[42:04.640 --> 42:07.200]  finally just say I don't care do whatever you're gonna do they don't know
[42:07.200 --> 42:11.560]  how to deal with that and they don't have to deal with somebody that knows the
[42:11.560 --> 42:15.520]  card tricks I'm catching them cheating with the cards in their sleeve I'm
[42:15.520 --> 42:23.000]  calling them on it so America and the world needs to get out of this sycophantic
[42:23.000 --> 42:27.760]  worship of tyranny and that going along to get along is cute and fun people need
[42:27.760 --> 42:33.680]  to rediscover the spirit of 1776 the answer to 1984 1776 but Kurt Nemo's
[42:33.680 --> 42:43.920]  got the article establishment blogger Constitution has no yeah Kurt needs to
[42:43.920 --> 42:47.440]  change that headline immediately I know Kurt writes a lot of stories every day
[42:47.440 --> 42:51.760]  and he's he's a Washington Post writer and an analyst for MSNBC we need to
[42:51.760 --> 43:00.040]  change that headline to MSNBC analyst Constitution has no binding power we
[43:00.040 --> 43:05.120]  don't have editors here because it we're working so fast and so hard and there's
[43:05.120 --> 43:11.440]  a hole that the Watsons have Aaron has Kurt has I have it too that they think
[43:11.440 --> 43:14.560]  a spell checker is an editor and it's not and the mistake that happens every
[43:14.560 --> 43:23.200]  day and almost every article is words other words because they think the
[43:23.200 --> 43:25.840]  spell checker is gonna catch it but if they have another word that's spelled
[43:25.840 --> 43:31.160]  correctly it's not but that's got to be the granddaddy of them right there and
[43:31.160 --> 43:33.640]  if it's embarrassing to talk about it hell it's embarrassing everybody seeing
[43:33.640 --> 43:39.280]  it so I just got to say we need to get that changed I know I'm evil I'm bad but
[43:39.280 --> 43:43.560]  it has no bidding power on anything I want the headline like I said this
[43:43.560 --> 43:49.120]  morning when I sent it over to be MSNBC analyst Constitution has no binding
[43:49.120 --> 43:58.720]  power on anything maybe Kurt thinks it says bidding I don't know okay let's go
[43:58.720 --> 44:03.400]  ahead and play the video clip here is as recline Constitution has no binding
[44:03.400 --> 44:08.080]  power on anything let's go ahead and roll it the Constitution that's what
[44:08.080 --> 44:13.120]  Republicans want to do in the new Congress in the last year the 223 year
[44:13.120 --> 44:17.200]  old document has been getting a whole lot of lip service so when the 112th
[44:17.200 --> 44:20.760]  Congress is sworn in next week expect to hear a lot more about it because the
[44:20.760 --> 44:24.720]  Constitution is at the center of three coming congressional battles and we love
[44:24.720 --> 44:28.280]  wonkery mixed up with politics so we're bringing our favorite wonk into the
[44:28.280 --> 44:33.160]  discussion to tee up some of the fights ahead MSNBC contributor Ezra Wankline
[44:33.160 --> 44:36.600]  is a staff writer for the Washington Post and joins us now Ezra good to see
[44:36.600 --> 44:41.640]  you thanks a lot you heard all the different politicians talking about
[44:41.640 --> 44:46.400]  the Constitution well this is what's gonna happen when Republicans take over
[44:46.400 --> 44:49.800]  next week they're gonna do something that apparently has never been done in
[44:49.800 --> 44:54.520]  the 221 year history of the House of Representatives they are going to read
[44:54.520 --> 45:00.800]  the Constitution aloud is this a gimmick yes it's a gimmick I mean you can say
[45:00.800 --> 45:04.320]  two things about it one is that it has no binding power on anything and the two
[45:04.320 --> 45:07.640]  the issue the Constitution is not that people don't read the text and think
[45:07.640 --> 45:10.440]  they're following the issue the Constitution is that the text is
[45:10.440 --> 45:14.280]  confusing because it was written more than a hundred years ago and what
[45:14.280 --> 45:18.240]  people believe it says differs from person to person and differs depending
[45:18.240 --> 45:21.200]  on what they want to get done so I wouldn't expect too much coming out of
[45:21.200 --> 45:39.320]  this
[45:39.320 --> 45:45.000]  okay we are back live so as reclined Constitution has no binding power on
[45:45.000 --> 45:51.000]  anything the article up at info wars dot com MSNBC analyst Constitution has
[45:51.000 --> 45:54.720]  no binding power on anything good article by Kurt Nemo up there if you
[45:54.720 --> 45:59.320]  want to see that but this is their ongoing drumbeat now what else do we
[45:59.320 --> 46:05.400]  see with this lawlessness in Texas the ATF and in Arizona and other border
[46:05.400 --> 46:10.760]  states is just ordering no judge no jury no nothing kind of like the FCC just
[46:10.760 --> 46:14.400]  said we're giving out an order that we now control the Internet and we're gonna
[46:14.400 --> 46:18.480]  protect it and then they announced it's net neutrality but actually it allows
[46:18.480 --> 46:21.880]  companies to start restricting what you can do where you can visit and give
[46:21.880 --> 46:27.000]  preferential treatment to certain websites like calling the Patriot Act
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.200]  patriotic it's the opposite of patriotism or the new freedom initiative
[46:31.200 --> 46:35.600]  to drug upwards of 50% of American school children that's not new freedom
[46:35.600 --> 46:40.080]  unless it's the globalist new freedom to enslave and brain damage people
[46:40.080 --> 46:43.560]  chemically in this giant mental institution prison planet they've built
[46:43.560 --> 46:49.240]  so feds want gun sellers to report rifle sales but then when you read deeper in
[46:49.240 --> 46:54.600]  these articles that's already going on just like earlier this year it was in
[46:54.600 --> 46:58.680]  Bloomberg that federal regulators are ordering private pension fund managers
[46:58.680 --> 47:03.040]  to quote invest in failed banks there's no law the government can order
[47:03.040 --> 47:07.600]  private pension funds to invest in failed banks stealing the money of
[47:07.600 --> 47:13.600]  pensioners that's what it does but but these companies go okay the government
[47:13.600 --> 47:18.400]  if I don't do what they say will come after me they're criminal here it is
[47:18.400 --> 47:24.480]  local gun rights activists oppose propose new over controlling policy that's
[47:24.480 --> 47:31.680]  how to San Antonio news KEN s5 so they're putting that in place now now
[47:31.680 --> 47:38.480]  here's another even bigger example of what I'm talking about right here EPA
[47:38.480 --> 47:45.920]  taking over Texas greenhouse permits see they claim the states control and
[47:45.920 --> 47:51.240]  they couldn't even get Congress to pass this law the EPA though just says
[47:51.240 --> 47:55.560]  they're gonna do it and then Texas that actually has force of law and the
[47:55.560 --> 48:00.680]  legislature and supplies most the power to Arkansas Louisiana Mississippi New
[48:00.680 --> 48:08.440]  Mexico Oklahoma oh we're the biggest greenhouse criminals why why we've got
[48:08.440 --> 48:13.360]  a power plant supplying power China builds a couple new ones every week we
[48:13.360 --> 48:20.440]  only get a couple a year we're not allowed to have power plants and the
[48:20.440 --> 48:25.160]  Environmental Protection Agency has waddled into the fray and is told
[48:25.160 --> 48:29.960]  Texas and told the governor and told the Attorney General that we don't care
[48:29.960 --> 48:34.200]  what you say and what you do we're taking over kind of like two years ago
[48:34.200 --> 48:39.320]  happened twice two years ago the Parliament in Canada said you know
[48:39.320 --> 48:44.080]  we're gonna remove the Prime Minister you know they elect him you elect them
[48:44.080 --> 48:47.960]  then they vote that's a parliamentary system and then he said you know what
[48:47.960 --> 48:51.880]  I'm calling in the Governor-General nothing and they just disbanded the
[48:51.880 --> 48:57.400]  Parliament the Queen runs this country see oh you got state sovereignty until
[48:57.400 --> 49:01.560]  we say so but then the Congress that is the power of the federal government
[49:01.560 --> 49:05.000]  even if the feds argue under the Commerce Clause or whatever that they
[49:05.000 --> 49:12.040]  have control the state which they don't the Congress makes the law and the
[49:12.040 --> 49:17.720]  Congress says no but the rogue bureaucracy doesn't care there's your
[49:17.720 --> 49:22.560]  example of lawlessness EPA taking over Texas greenhouse gas permits the
[49:22.560 --> 49:26.240]  Environmental Protection Agency announced Thursday that it is taking the
[49:26.240 --> 49:30.640]  unprecedented step of directly issuing air permits to industries in Texas
[49:30.640 --> 49:34.360]  under their new rules citing the state's unwillingness to comply with
[49:34.360 --> 49:39.640]  greenhouse gas regulations going into effect January 2nd the EPA which has
[49:39.640 --> 49:46.560]  no force of law but it's kind of like it's policy with the TSA they stick
[49:46.560 --> 49:51.360]  their hands down your pants and now they're taking over the malls and the
[49:51.360 --> 49:55.920]  streets we're gonna come back go to your break go to your calls in the next
[49:55.920 --> 49:58.440]  segment the segment after that and at eight after dr. Paul Kirk Roberts

[50:22.040 --> 50:28.040]  talking to you directly on the other side of this quick break but again that
[50:28.040 --> 50:36.280]  very important story that is up on info wars dot com establishment

[54:18.000 --> 54:24.200]  it doesn't matter it you know it's not binding these are conscious tyrants
[54:24.200 --> 54:30.120]  they've they've joined the bad guys they want to bring in tyranny and so if
[54:30.120 --> 54:34.760]  there is no law over government then it is hitlerian it is the fear of precept
[54:34.760 --> 54:39.280]  let's go to your phone calls here appreciate folks holding let's talk to
[54:39.280 --> 54:44.120]  John in Wyoming John you're on the air welcome good morning Alex and happy new
[54:44.120 --> 54:47.600]  year to you good to have you I'm calling I'm calling from Sheridan
[54:47.600 --> 54:51.320]  Wyoming because I wanted to let you know that for months I've been battling our
[54:51.320 --> 54:56.600]  corrupt mayor on this water fluoridation issue and on December 20th he and a
[54:56.600 --> 55:01.240]  couple of his cronies voted to implement water fluoridation and of course
[55:01.240 --> 55:05.520]  attached to that is the promise of a federal grant between four million and
[55:05.520 --> 55:08.880]  eight million dollars well that's because the feds care that your teeth be
[55:08.880 --> 55:13.360]  healthy again when they're not nerve-gassing foster children or troops
[55:13.360 --> 55:21.400]  or hiring Nazis or funding communists that they've come on John they care man what
[55:21.400 --> 55:26.440]  they're doing is they're using the as a pretext for this four to eight million
[55:26.440 --> 55:32.160]  dollar grant to treat against crypto spuridium in the water and then also to
[55:32.160 --> 55:36.760]  implement or implement water fluoridation I gotta say this though John you
[55:36.760 --> 55:39.920]  know I did make the requests that people call in about what they thought the
[55:39.920 --> 55:43.720]  biggest news story of 2010 was or what they think is most important so I guess
[55:43.720 --> 55:48.640]  in a way you're kind of on the massive huge field of topics but this has been a
[55:48.640 --> 55:52.880]  big year for the truth about this phenol A and plastic coming out and about all
[55:52.880 --> 55:56.200]  these chemicals in the home and how it's destroying people's autoimmune system
[55:56.200 --> 56:01.760]  but I personally believe and I've studied the law that you can prove that in
[56:01.760 --> 56:05.160]  the so-called sodium fluoride the government may have listed that rat
[56:05.160 --> 56:08.880]  poison is good but they haven't listed mercury lead and other things is good
[56:08.880 --> 56:13.120]  you get a four-year you get a sample of the brand and the company they're using
[56:13.120 --> 56:18.600]  then you sue them it's gonna have radium uranium in it as well probably from
[56:18.600 --> 56:23.280]  where they mine this stuff and most companies do and even the dumbest people
[56:23.280 --> 56:28.800]  out there know uranium's not good for you I passed out a copy of the case
[56:28.800 --> 56:34.000]  against fluoride by dr. Paul Connick to every member of city council as well as
[56:34.000 --> 56:38.680]  the mayor the day before Thanksgiving now they had the vote four weeks later on
[56:38.680 --> 56:42.000]  December 20th so they each had time to read the book yeah they don't care
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.040]  they're being given lobbying money I appreciate your call John it's just
[56:45.040 --> 56:48.680]  it's just terrible but I'm glad you're out there fighting and think and see now
[56:48.680 --> 56:52.240]  they're proposing lithium in the water I mean if they can do that why not
[56:52.240 --> 56:57.320]  lithium and they say it is to make you calm let's talk to Heath in Texas you're
[56:57.320 --> 57:04.600]  on the year yes sir hey buddy go ahead oh yeah as first time listener or first
[57:04.600 --> 57:08.800]  time caller welcome I was just going ahead thank you Alex for everything you

[57:18.320 --> 57:21.760]  couldn't do without the listeners but I mean briefly what do you think some of
[57:21.760 --> 57:28.520]  the biggest developments were in 2010 probably the financial and the Fed that's
[57:28.520 --> 57:33.680]  the one thing that you woke me up on is it's owned by all oligarchy of 12 banks
[57:33.680 --> 57:41.040]  instead of it's a federal that's it and 2010 was the year where the poll went
[57:41.040 --> 57:47.480]  from 5% a decade ago or less knowing it was private to 20 30% in 2009 to
[57:47.480 --> 57:52.720]  national polls between 75 and 80 plus percent knowing it's private and a
[57:52.720 --> 57:57.440]  fraud but I'll tell you that's some good news isn't it Heath yes sir yes sir I
[57:57.440 --> 58:01.760]  appreciate it Alex and you have a good day I appreciate you Heath let's talk to

[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:42.680]  okay it's chilling cold that we were just taking their Sean Illinois and yes the
[01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:47.680]  mainstream media is doing that drumbeat again that they did ahead of 9-11 ahead of
[01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:51.960]  Oklahoma City saying the terrorists are gonna hit you and we're gonna take your
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:55.520]  rights away to keep you safe they create that false equation that you give up
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:58.720]  rights and you get safety you get prosperity when we know it's the
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:03.240]  opposite liberty is the engine of prosperity tyranny is the engine of
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.800]  death and degradation and humiliation and yes I've been seeing all those
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:13.600]  different editorials where they're really hyping the terrorists coming but
[01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:17.160]  this won't be like 9-11 where nobody's watching look at the underwear bomber a
[01:01:17.160 --> 01:01:21.680]  year ago we had our listeners on board Kurt Haskell was a listener he saw the
[01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:25.560]  government get him on the plane the media tried to deny it but months later it
[01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:28.920]  came out we were right and it was all true and now even mainstream news drudge
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:34.240]  on Monday linked to Kurt Nemo's article it in fact I just got to say
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:38.800]  incredible job Matt drudge that had all the history of these being staged
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:45.920]  events new talla but all of it and and and we're all a lucky at the Pentagon I
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:50.160]  mean it's incredible great job Kurt Nemo by the way with that article he did
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:56.400]  about the TSA rolling out nationwide but this stuff's coming out and so yes of
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:02:00.560]  course of course they want to stage big terror attacks I predicted one right
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:04.160]  before the election you know she saw the data tax so they could poses our
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:07.200]  saviors but that we that's why we've got to get the word out about government
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:12.360]  sponsored terror Sean go ahead and finish a point what was chilling I mean you
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:15.320]  hear about that all the time that there could be a terrorist attack both these
[01:02:15.320 --> 01:02:19.280]  guys they didn't just say there was gonna be a terrorist attack they described
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:24.640]  what was going to happen and they said that there could be somebody in a highly
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:28.200]  populated area they're gonna have a floating vest a car bomb or machine gun
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:33.440]  and then after that that's when they put their political points out Alex I've
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:36.680]  never read anything like that before what's the headline what's the headline on
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:42.000]  the article it's Cal Thomas and Bob back all you would I read it the newspaper I
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.600]  think it's online but it's the USA today I would I would encourage you to look
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.920]  at it but what was the headline like like we're gonna have terror 2011 Cal
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:54.840]  Thomas it's in the it's in the 2011 predictions about halfway down they're
[01:02:54.840 --> 01:03:01.040]  talking about them basically before what they did so Cal Thomas Bob Beckel
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.160]  2011 predictions I'll get it to the Watson's right now because we need to
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:09.920]  point out that we have the CFR report they put out a year before 9-11
[01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:15.920]  predicting and all and then they bragged about how right they were so they just
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:21.000]  love doing this amazing your question real quick why do they do it I mean it
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:26.040]  can't be that important to them the stuff I mean it cannot be that important
[01:03:26.040 --> 01:03:32.200]  to kill people well let me I mean let me go further why have they had scores of
[01:03:32.200 --> 01:03:37.200]  top Republicans Pentagon statements a whole bunch of Obama people like Robert
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.000]  Shapiro in the Financial Times of London to the point of Beck came out a month
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.440]  and a half ago and said they're gonna stage in Oklahoma City and blame it on
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:48.000]  people like me you know Beck said they're gonna blame it on him which is
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.520]  actually true you read the Southern Parvy Law Center and media matters
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.560]  George Soros talking points it's two people they say Glenn Beck and Alex
[01:03:55.560 --> 01:03:59.000]  Jones are gonna cause mass death and they've already trained the cops the
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.920]  last five years there will be car bombs there will be local attacks they bought
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:06.840]  all the robots and all the cities I mean they're getting the feds are gonna do it
[01:04:06.840 --> 01:04:11.960]  they're gonna roll out I mean again just like they masked all the US troops in
[01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:15.880]  and around Afghanistan signed the lawn shorter the day before 9-11 they've got
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:20.200]  their architects are in place they've already trained the cops it's coming the
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.000]  cops like robots when it happens will bow down to the feds the threat fusion
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:28.440]  centers they need a trigger to really bring in hardcore martial law we're
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:32.760]  already in serious martial law with the groping the checkpoints the federal TSA
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.840]  rollout this is when we go into depression why do they kill people because
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:40.120]  they need to scare folks they need to kill some people and say look people

[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:21.520]  predictions for 2011 and also what you think was most important in 2010 Dr.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:24.960]  Roberts is only with us for two segments so coming up at 33 after I'll go to Sam
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:29.960]  Chris James Caroline Ken and others that are patiently holding got Max Kaiser
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:34.840]  coming in on the fourth hour today Bob Chapman popping in open phones interspersed
[01:08:34.840 --> 01:08:37.960]  throughout the next three hours that we have left here he's written a lot of
[01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:41.520]  important articles we've been posting up at info wars.com America's caught up
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:46.920]  with 1984 descent is what rescues democracy from the quiet death behind
[01:08:46.920 --> 01:08:56.680]  closed doors continues here he's also got a report out on 2011 and we're gonna be
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:01.760]  breaking all of that down with him today but first off I wanted to get Dr.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:09.000]  Roberts take on people like Ezra Klein of the Washington Post and MSNBC
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.440]  analyst more and more these Congress people and others they just keep saying
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:18.320]  the Constitution doesn't matter that it has no binding power that it's bad I
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:21.680]  see judges saying and I mean they know what they're doing they're really I
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:27.960]  guess trying to acclimate us to real tyranny Dr. Roberts certainly looks that
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:34.080]  way Alex and it's quite amazing the Constitution doesn't seem to have any
[01:09:34.080 --> 01:09:39.240]  friends except perhaps the American Civil Liberties Union the law schools
[01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:46.400]  the quiet the bar associations are quiet and from the most part of the
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:54.440]  judiciary's quiet so when people give up on democracy and they give up on the
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:10:01.000]  Constitution then the only thing that's left is dictatorship and generally they
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:09.200]  are they're tyrannical for anyone who gets in their way or or is inclined to
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:15.800]  challenge them. Dr. Roberts what did you think of the reports in the last two
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:20.080]  weeks confirming that Homeland Security was not just only spying on members of
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:26.240]  the legislature of Pennsylvania but also in Tennessee and in Florida actually
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:32.240]  sending spies into Ron Paul campaign for Liberty meetings and spying on the ACLU
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:39.600]  and listing them not just as extremist but as possible terrorist. Right well
[01:10:39.600 --> 01:10:46.040]  it you know if all these reports are correct then quite clearly they're going
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:53.480]  to shut down any dissent and shut down any protections that people have in the
[01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:59.880]  Bill of Rights against the government. You know Alex look what was probably the
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:09.000]  most awful thing that happened when Obama was elected with very large
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:15.960]  majority and a lot of support and the Democrats had the House and the Senate
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:24.360]  and all of those Democrats have the responsibility to uphold the laws of the
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:30.760]  United States. They're all sworn to uphold the Constitution and yet their
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:36.960]  leader in the House Nancy Pelosi said over and over and over that they're not
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:43.360]  going to look into the crimes of the Bush regime despite the fact that the
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:50.040]  crimes were well known they're unequivocal. We know for a fact that the Bush
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:58.080]  regime violated American statutory law by spying on Americans without obtaining
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:04.200]  warrants from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. We know for a fact
[01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:13.200]  that the Bush who admits it in his book violated US statutory law by torturing
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:20.720]  people which is against American law. We know for a fact that the Bush regime
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:27.160]  committed treason they led us into a war based on lies and deceptions. This is
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:35.840]  high treason it's also a war crime. So we have these enormous crimes and nothing
[01:12:35.840 --> 01:12:44.200]  was done. So what the Obama regime did was to accept the precedent established
[01:12:44.200 --> 01:12:49.520]  by the Bush-Cheney regime that the executive branch is not accountable to
[01:12:49.520 --> 01:12:55.760]  law. Now if you compare this to just a few years ago when the House of
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.680]  Representatives impeached Bill Clinton because he had a sexual affair with a
[01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:07.880]  White House intern and lied about it. And you go back a few more years and
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:14.960]  Nixon had to resign because he lied about when he first learned about the
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:25.280]  Watergate burglary. So you've seen a tremendous collapse in the authority of
[01:13:25.280 --> 01:13:31.160]  law in the United States in the accountability of government and as you
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:38.640]  say that's the end of the Constitution. And we see also all sorts of clamped
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:47.680]  downs on dissent. So that now dissent is the equivalent of terrorism or aid to
[01:13:47.680 --> 01:13:55.640]  terrorists. It's extremism. They're investigating war protesters. They're
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:04.120]  spying on everybody. So it's a police state. You know I've said that several
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:11.640]  times over the past years but we now see it demonstrated they feel the ability
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:16.680]  simply to show that that's what it is. And doctor I want to elaborate on that
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:21.880]  because just two months ago or so I had you on the show and I said they're now
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.840]  putting their hands down people's pants and you said Alex and I don't blame you
[01:14:25.840 --> 01:14:31.080]  because it's insane. Send me a video with that. I'm not and then of course then
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:35.680]  it blew up nationwide and the videos are now out there and this show was the
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:42.820]  epicenter of that. But I mean just so you know it's in the mainline papers in
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:46.920]  Tennessee and Florida they got the documents. For those that don't know it
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:52.000]  is confirmed that they didn't just list Ron Paul's groups as being a sign of
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:56.880]  extremism. They went and spied on them as potential terrorists. They've had the
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:01.520]  army spy on Ron Paul and myself. I was sent that by moles inside the army a
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:07.720]  year and a half ago. And so I understand even your apprehension because I
[01:15:07.720 --> 01:15:13.200]  have it as well. I think when we come face to face with such bonafide arrogant
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:17.000]  tyranny that it's hard for us who are really in the middle of all this
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:20.720]  researching it to believe it. And that takes me back to this and this is my
[01:15:20.720 --> 01:15:25.840]  question. A bunch of people. I mean it was it was more than 30. I've tried to
[01:15:25.840 --> 01:15:32.240]  count them all up but private contractors, army personnel from Afghanistan,
[01:15:32.240 --> 01:15:38.520]  from Iraq, they went to prison for torturing. But then we got the John U
[01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:42.240]  White House memos and the Alberta Gonzalez memos and it was confirmed that
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:45.680]  Bush and Cheney had ordered it and said they could even torture kids in front
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:49.800]  of people and the Washington Post allotted it in a 2002 article that's in
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:52.640]  my film wrote a tyranny and said yeah we do stuff to kids in front of their
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:56.360]  parents so they're trying to sell us on the evil. Bush comes out and says yeah
[01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:00.360]  I ordered torture I do it again. So how do the people that got caught go to
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:05.120]  prison but then the people that give the order don't. I mean I think that makes
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:11.480]  your point for you. I suppose that the executive branch feels it can do whatever
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:20.040]  he wants. Look Alex, I saw a report today of the latest poll of public support
[01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:25.240]  or lack thereof for the war in Afghanistan. Over two-thirds of the
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:31.080]  American people have turned against this war and yet we had the Pentagon chief
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:35.200]  Gates the other day say that it doesn't matter what the American people think,
[01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:42.320]  we're committed to this war and we don't care what the people think and yet
[01:16:42.320 --> 01:16:46.440]  while they say that out of one side of the mouth, out of the other side of the
[01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:51.200]  mouth they talk about we have freedom and democracy. Well you don't have
[01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:57.560]  democracy when the government is immune to public opinion. So and you can find
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:03.040]  this immunity to public opinion everywhere and you can find the public
[01:17:03.040 --> 01:17:10.520]  itself doesn't seem to appreciate free speech. For example what is the main
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:17.200]  feature of American public discourse recently? Look at what comes out of the
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:24.120]  WikiLeaks saga. You have people demanding revenge against people who tell us
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:30.080]  the truth. Well they're calling for the death of Julian Assange. Right and so
[01:17:30.080 --> 01:17:38.520]  many ordinary Americans agree. So they're calling for my execution then you know
[01:17:38.520 --> 01:17:43.320]  how many secret documents we've put out. I mean that's the end of the free press.
[01:17:43.320 --> 01:17:46.680]  I even heard him calling for prosecution of the newspapers that
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:52.720]  published this stuff. I mean yes okay Alex I'm sure I'm sure that you're right
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:18:02.080]  about that and here's what I think the fear is. This coming year starting
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:08.000]  tomorrow as far as I can tell there's no there's no possibility of an economic
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:15.400]  recovery is probably going to be a resumption of a downturn. There doesn't
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:23.080]  seem to be anything in place to halt these gratuitous wars of conquest and
[01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:31.400]  occupation and yet everyone is frustrated with them. I mean probably the
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:36.880]  people would support them if we were winning or if we could present it more
[01:18:36.880 --> 01:18:44.440]  convincingly that we're winning. And so Obama is probably toast and so that
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:50.080]  leaves the Republicans. Now even more than the Democrats the Republicans have
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:56.480]  become a party of brown shorts. They don't believe in civil liberties. Civil
[01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:01.240]  liberties is something that coddles criminals and coddles terrorists and
[01:19:01.240 --> 01:19:07.160]  let's liberal judges let people off who should be punished and and all of that.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:11.080]  So the conservatives don't care about bill rights. It's something that's in the
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:18.480]  way of their agendas. They want to get people. And so we'll end up with the
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:23.720]  Republicans in the White House and controlling the Congress. And of course
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:29.280]  what are their doctrines? Well they believe in the primacy of the executive
[01:19:29.280 --> 01:19:37.120]  branch over the other branches. This is their unitary executive theory and they
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:42.560]  believe in the hegemonic right of Americans to rule the world. And so I
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:50.640]  think 2012 will mark the end of American democracy probably in the last year of it
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:56.600]  right now. It will continue to be eroded. Stay there powerful intel from Dr. Paul

[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:06.320]  off the gold standard US dollars been evaluating what people don't know
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:10.200]  however is how this directly affects your personal finances. Is there a way to
[01:22:10.200 --> 01:22:13.840]  protect your portfolios from losing value? The answer to all of this is gold and
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.920]  silver. They both have maintained their purchasing power for 6,000 years. If you
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:23.840]  had $100,000 in cash and $100,000 in gold and silver back in 1913 and kept
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:28.240]  them until now your cash would have the buying power of only $4,800 but your
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:31.600]  gold and silver would have the buying power of $3,000,000. The answer to

[01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:13.600]  completely agree with Dr. Paul Craig Roberts. This has been a long term
[01:24:13.600 --> 01:24:18.040]  military industrial complex takeover of the United States and we've been used
[01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:23.280]  as the engine of the planet, the engine of tyranny worldwide. Dr. finishing up
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:28.920]  the point that you were making about 2011 and the final preparations for the
[01:24:28.920 --> 01:24:39.400]  complete end of the Republic. Well I think we finished it Alex. There's
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:47.240]  nothing on the scene that's coming to the defense of civil liberty and the
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:55.760]  Constitution or of accountable government and there's no sign of any
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:04.440]  opposition to the snowballing police state and we see repeatedly from agencies
[01:25:04.440 --> 01:25:10.080]  of the federal government a complete contempt for the public. For example the
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:16.080]  TSA, you know the airport security people, they have made it completely clear
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:20.720]  that they will arrive at no accommodation with the American people other
[01:25:20.720 --> 01:25:29.080]  than the violation of their persons that they imposed by brute force. We have the
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:35.440]  secretary of defense which is a euphemism saying that we're going to
[01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:38.840]  conduct wars and don't care what the people think because they don't have
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:48.040]  anything to do with our decisions and we have all this massive spying not just
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:53.080]  on state and local governments and our war protesters but essentially on
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:26:01.960]  everybody and the accumulation of massive numbers of dossiers on people.
[01:26:01.960 --> 01:26:05.720]  Well they couldn't possibly be that many terrorists. If there were that many
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:11.560]  terrorists the whole country would be going up in explosions right now. In fact
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:17.440]  the only acts of terrorism that we ever see are the orchestrated cases that are
[01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:22.160]  part of FBI what they call stealing operations. They go out and find some
[01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:30.080]  hapless guy and provoke him into some plot that they give him and string this
[01:26:30.080 --> 01:26:35.800]  along and then they capture it. Well the total confirmation of that is Dr.
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:41.520]  Roberts is the TSA has now announced 9,000 locations with telescreens giving
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:46.600]  you orders to spy on other shoppers and your family. TSA to be on the streets
[01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.680]  everywhere. I mean this is a federal goon force that sticks its hands down your
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:56.360]  pants which is prisoner submission training. Well you know when they got
[01:26:56.360 --> 01:27:06.280]  away with 9-11 that sealed our fate because that became the excuse and you
[01:27:06.280 --> 01:27:11.760]  still don't see any real challenge other than from the truthers which the
[01:27:11.760 --> 01:27:16.320]  government and the mainstream media and as far as I can tell majority of people
[01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:23.360]  keep marginalized despite their qualifications and the and the rigor
[01:27:23.360 --> 01:27:28.680]  of their research and reasoning. So I think when they got away with 9-11
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:36.000]  that's when they captured everything because everything else flows from
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:41.400]  that. That's the excuse that's where yeah all terror came from that's where all
[01:27:41.400 --> 01:27:46.440]  of the police state implications. But I don't want to end this interview on a
[01:27:46.440 --> 01:27:51.640]  negative note here because Geraldo Rivera has come out and said he doesn't
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.920]  believe building seven story. Judge Aaron Apolitano says it's a complete fraud
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:02.640]  it needs to be investigated. We've seen I mean just a lot of positive Matt Drudge
[01:28:02.640 --> 01:28:06.560]  is now linking to articles that we write that talk about stage terror. I mean
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:11.520]  things are really I think people are waking up it's always darkest before the
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:17.080]  dawn. I mean even the Guardian says the TSA state mandated molestation. I mean I
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:22.880]  think they've gone too far. I think we've got a dog in the fight. Well it suits
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:35.200]  me. You know I don't I don't want them to prevail but you know you know the
[01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:41.760]  population itself is really not sufficiently clued in and time is
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:50.520]  vanishing which there'll still be the ability to act and in fact what you'll
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:55.960]  see happen the population will end up electing the Republican goons who will
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:29:01.840]  complete the police state. That's my opinion. Now I'm perfectly happy if I'm
[01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:09.080]  wrong and and I don't know what's going to happen to the judge and to Geraldo
[01:29:09.080 --> 01:29:20.280]  and usually news people who dissent from the line find their career. I look what
[01:29:20.280 --> 01:29:27.040]  happened to Helen Thomas so quickly. So I don't know what will happen to them now
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.800]  if they survive and they go on and they continue but you know you've got to be
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:35.280]  skeptical. Well hold on doc I know you're only scheduled for 30 and I got to get to
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:38.520]  calls but let's come back and put bookends on this. Finish your statement.
[01:29:38.520 --> 01:29:41.440]  We'll do about three minutes with you on the other side going into the new year
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:45.440]  any other predictions. Then I'm going straight to your phone calls continually
[01:29:45.440 --> 01:29:49.360]  right through with Max Kaiser and Bob Chapman. Dr. Paul Craig Roberts is our
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:56.480]  guest. We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[01:29:56.480 --> 01:30:03.200]  radio network. This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[01:30:03.200 --> 01:30:07.520]  buying a solar power generator. Number one new climate legislation could easily
[01:30:07.520 --> 01:30:11.720]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two our new energies are wants to
[01:30:11.720 --> 01:30:15.520]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have. It's true
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:19.160]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:23.720]  technology is coming. Number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:30:23.720 --> 01:30:28.400]  dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation is only compounding
[01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:32.120]  the problem. Number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:35.600]  Every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:39.560]  onages. Number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[01:30:39.560 --> 01:30:42.720]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks I really believe in the solar power
[01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:46.400]  generators offered by Solutions from Science. One of my oldest sponsors. You
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:51.920]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:56.480]  Remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:03.200]  call 1-877-327-0365. You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs
[01:31:03.200 --> 01:31:06.840]  generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:10.920]  silver solutions. Yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:14.400]  system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:19.240]  in or on the body. My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the
[01:31:19.240 --> 01:31:23.440]  Silver Lungs generator. Not only does the Silver Lungs system produce endless
[01:31:23.440 --> 01:31:27.600]  colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped with the proper
[01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:32.040]  applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:39.280]  key target areas. This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:43.800]  and orally for the digestive system. Be sure to watch our new 7-minute video
[01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:50.040]  tour of the Silver Lungs system at www.silverlungs.com to learn more about
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:54.680]  how the Silver Lungs system works. As well we are always ready to answer any
[01:31:54.680 --> 01:32:01.400]  questions you may have. That's www.silverlungs.com. Hi folks this is Alex Jones
[01:32:01.400 --> 01:32:05.280]  asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap. Not detergents but
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:09.200]  good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Calvin soap company, a family owned and
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:14.200]  operated American company. My family, staff, friends and radio listeners are constantly
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:17.520]  telling me how much they love these products for bath, air, laundry and
[01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:21.240]  dishes. There is nothing like these factory direct big-money saving triple
[01:32:21.240 --> 01:32:27.680]  concentrated soaps anywhere. Get a free detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.760]  or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com. Let's talk to the owner of
[01:32:32.760 --> 01:33:02.720]  5-star soap Marty Schachter and see what he has to say. We now take
[01:33:02.720 --> 01:33:07.640]  you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:14.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show. We're taking a ton of your phone
[01:33:14.560 --> 01:33:18.080]  calls with what you think was most important in 2010, what you think is
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:22.560]  going to happen in 2011 and beyond coming up here in just about three minutes. I
[01:33:22.560 --> 01:33:27.280]  wanted Dr. Paul Craig Roberts to finish up the statement that he was making but
[01:33:27.280 --> 01:33:33.040]  I mean doc in the final equation we're here, we live here. It's a global
[01:33:33.040 --> 01:33:37.720]  tyranny. This tyranny has been exported everywhere. There's continuity of
[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:43.400]  agenda. There's really nowhere to run. We learned that the DEA is really just a
[01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:47.760]  secret arm of the CIA. I mean we already really knew that but now that's mainstream
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:53.320]  news. I mean they're openly trying to start censoring the internet. That's
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:58.440]  being announced. I mean it's crazy times are here but doesn't it take tyranny to
[01:33:58.440 --> 01:34:05.520]  finally get people out of their their morass? Well not necessarily. You know the
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:12.040]  Germans had tyranny and they mainly accepted it. It doesn't generally bother
[01:34:12.040 --> 01:34:17.840]  you unless you get in their way. You know Hitler didn't put the whole country in
[01:34:17.840 --> 01:34:24.880]  camps. So I think we'll have to see what happens to WikiLeaks and its founder.
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:30.840]  We'll have to see what they do to the internet. The people who think have
[01:34:30.840 --> 01:34:35.800]  turned away from the print and TV media and they do rely on the internet so
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:42.360]  that's a danger. We'll see if WikiLeaks and its leader can
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:49.280]  escape the cultures of the Americans and if the internet can continue to
[01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:59.360]  present uncensored information then we can we can continue our opposition.
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:05.320]  Otherwise things just get closed down. They've been very successful as you
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:13.600]  emphasize every day in closing things down. Well we're in for the fight of our
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:18.600]  lives but I'm seeing a lot of positive people and Ron Paul and Lou Rockwell and
[01:35:18.600 --> 01:35:21.400]  so many others that you know that I respect with their historical
[01:35:21.400 --> 01:35:26.080]  understanding and their finger on the pulse. They certainly concur that we're
[01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:32.240]  going into a real hardcore very vicious premeditated tyranny but that there's
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:36.840]  also a big awakening happening and you know we've had a lot of tyranny and
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:41.760]  sedition acts before but those have been reversed. I think stage terror is the
[01:35:41.760 --> 01:35:47.360]  ace in the hole and we've confirmed that USA Today has Cal Thomas predicting
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:52.280]  massive car bombings machine gun attacks all over the country and we know
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:58.560]  that's not going to come from a real you know organized Muslim threat and so
[01:35:58.560 --> 01:36:03.320]  they're gearing up for a major Pentagon Operation Northwood style event but I
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:07.400]  think 9-11 Truth has really introduced the idea of false flag terror to the
[01:36:07.400 --> 01:36:13.200]  point but this isn't going to go the way they think it is. Suits me. I hope they
[01:36:13.200 --> 01:36:18.160]  fail. Well what are you doing for the new year? I'm just going to try to take it
[01:36:18.160 --> 01:36:25.920]  easy. All right Dr. Roberts it's always great having you pop in. That's scary
[01:36:25.920 --> 01:36:29.600]  though that you think that the economy is going to continue to degenerate in
[01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:37.800]  2011. Yes I think the downturn will renew because it's nothing to drive the
[01:36:37.800 --> 01:36:44.320]  recovery and of course the deficits will get larger and the Federal Reserve will
[01:36:44.320 --> 01:36:50.760]  monetize yet more of them and at some point there'll be some sort of problem
[01:36:50.760 --> 01:36:57.560]  with inflation and high unemployment at the same time. Are we already starting to
[01:36:57.560 --> 01:37:02.160]  see that with oil going up in gold and silver and food on average? Corns up
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:08.080]  almost 50%? You may be. All right Dr. Thank you so much for
[01:37:08.080 --> 01:37:13.280]  spending time with us. Briefly tell folks about your newest book. Well it's how
[01:37:13.280 --> 01:37:18.800]  the economy was lost and it tells them exactly how the economy was lost. It's
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:25.480]  easy to read short chapters. You're an extremist. How dare you father of
[01:37:25.480 --> 01:37:29.520]  Reaganomics speak out against all the insanity that's happening. You're
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:33.600]  probably almost as bad as Ron Paul or the ACLU. Maybe we need to have have some
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:40.320]  spies come look at you, huh? They probably are Alex. I don't have as
[01:37:40.320 --> 01:37:45.360]  large of audiences as you so they'll get you first. Yeah I'm the canary in the
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:48.780]  coal mine. All right God bless you. Have a great new year. We're going to win this
[01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:56.280]  thing. Okay. Amen. Take care my friend. Have a good new year. There goes Dr. Paul
[01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:01.680]  Craig Roberts. What a character. We're in a morass though. A area of muddy or
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:06.640]  boggy ground. A complicated or confusing situation. But we know the way out.
[01:38:06.640 --> 01:38:11.840]  Saying no to tyranny, yes to liberty. And getting the average person moving.
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:17.600]  Because Hitler at first only persecuted minorities, which was bad and wrong. But
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:22.080]  he beta tested it there with unpopular groups to set the precedent. Just like
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:24.960]  they say, oh, we're doing this to fight the Muslims. And then you get the
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:32.760]  internal documents. It's all about gun owners, veterans, libertarians, farming
[01:38:32.760 --> 01:38:37.040]  communities because you are seen as independent. And then you got the good
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:40.480]  old boys or some of the biggest cheerleaders for the police state because
[01:38:40.480 --> 01:38:44.040]  the globalist dangle the Muslim puppet in front of them and say, get the puppet,
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:48.800]  get the puppet. And then they just kind of like a bull charging a red cape of the
[01:38:48.800 --> 01:38:53.040]  matador. They run right through the red cape and there's the sword on the other
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:39:01.160]  side for them. It's really that simple. And that's a fact. And you wonder why
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:05.040]  everything's falling apart. This is globalism. It's designed to do it. Okay,
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:07.880]  let's go to your phone calls here. I want to take a lot of calls and I haven't
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:10.880]  really done it yet today, but we're going to attempt it right now. So we're
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:14.160]  going to move quick through the callers. Sam in California. Thanks for holding.
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:19.840]  Hey, Alex, I just want to say, you know, Happy New Year. And I'm going to be
[01:39:19.840 --> 01:39:24.640]  expecting the next book from the good doctor to be how we won the economy
[01:39:24.640 --> 01:39:28.240]  because we're going to win this thing. I guarantee you it's just a matter of
[01:39:28.240 --> 01:39:32.880]  time before everybody wakes up. And that's, well, I know this, we don't have
[01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:37.880]  a choice. I mean, these look, this corruption is not like a Pinochet or
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:41.800]  something that was bad enough. These people are control freaks who want to
[01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:47.240]  remake society in the family and kill over 80% of us. And they're on, I mean,
[01:39:47.560 --> 01:39:51.680]  ladies and gentlemen, they're not playing games. This is a life and death
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:58.120]  situation. Alex, they're going to try and, you know, to quote the late great
[01:39:58.480 --> 01:40:04.160]  JFK, an error does not become a mistake until we refuse to fix it. And we're
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:11.240]  going to fix it. And the biggest event of 2010, in my eyes, is the awakening.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:17.880]  It's not that subtle. It's a very big thing to have people being awakened
[01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:23.120]  to the events that are happening right before our eyes that were being lied
[01:40:23.120 --> 01:40:29.480]  to about like 9-11. And it takes time. If you remember in the first following
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:34.040]  days of 9-11, how everyone went to the welders all through, all throughout
[01:40:34.040 --> 01:40:39.640]  the United States went there to cut the steel and help remove rubble. It's just
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:44.840]  a matter of time before people realize which direction is the right way to
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:49.680]  point their patriotism. Well, that's already starting to happen. And that's
[01:40:49.680 --> 01:40:53.560]  why the global stage events to take the goodwill, the American people and
[01:40:53.560 --> 01:40:58.280]  focus it into evil because they believe they're doing good. That's the
[01:40:58.280 --> 01:41:05.480]  globalist biggest trick, but we are gaining ground. We are reversing the
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:12.440]  tide. And I know this. If all the people I run into on the street weren't just
[01:41:12.440 --> 01:41:17.680]  listeners or viewers or quote supporters, and I know a lot of them are doing
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:21.000]  positive things, but if they got aggressive and put up flyers, started
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.120]  their own online radio show, went and brokered Tom on a local AMR FM on the
[01:41:25.120 --> 01:41:30.600]  weekend, went and did an access TV show, ran for city council, ran for Congress.
[01:41:30.600 --> 01:41:36.080]  It's the educational process of putting out the alternative to what the
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:39.800]  globalist are doing. We can't just be against the globalist. That's important
[01:41:39.800 --> 01:41:43.400]  to identify them as the criminals, but we've also got to go in and say the
[01:41:43.400 --> 01:41:48.840]  solution is restore the Republic, take the Congress back, hold these Republicans'
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:54.280]  feet to the fire. I mean, look, Dr. Roberts is down in the dumps because he's a
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:59.000]  smart guy. He can see how outrageous this is. He's awake. And so it's very
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:04.160]  painful to see people that aren't, but I've gone past that. I've learned, you
[01:42:04.160 --> 01:42:08.120]  know, that I was once a dumb as dirt and I appreciate your booing call. A very
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:14.880]  uplifting Sam. God bless you. But I know it takes time to turn a big ship around.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:19.040]  And we are beginning to turn it around. And the system knows that there is a
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:25.120]  fight over the wheel of the ship right now. And we are in a death struggle. We
[01:42:25.120 --> 01:42:29.840]  are in a life and death struggle against the forces of evil, against the
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:35.360]  corrupt, greedy, power-tripping armies that have combined forces together to
[01:42:35.360 --> 01:42:41.240]  engage in predator operations against free humanity. Humans are predators. And
[01:42:41.240 --> 01:42:45.840]  we've dominated the planet. And in the last four or five thousand years, humans
[01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:50.480]  have set up societies and in most cases, they set up a predatory system over the
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:54.360]  population. Now we have a high-tech version of that that we will not survive
[01:42:54.360 --> 01:43:03.960]  if we don't get out of this. And we have to face that. And I'm making the
[01:43:03.960 --> 01:43:09.320]  resolution to refocus, redouble our efforts, intensify what we're doing in the
[01:43:09.320 --> 01:43:14.640]  new year. Because every day, every minute is precious. And there's still so much
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:20.480]  liberty and so much freedom that people are going to rediscover those old
[01:43:20.480 --> 01:43:26.360]  reflexes. And they are rediscovering them. It's very exciting. Let's go ahead.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:29.360]  Well, I mean, finishing up at the point I was trying to make, and then I go off
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:37.120]  in other issues. Well, it doesn't matter. Let's just go back to calls. It's a
[01:43:37.120 --> 01:43:42.320]  kaleidoscope of ideas I want to cover. Let's talk to Chris in Washington. Chris,
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:46.880]  you're on the air. Alex, make sure everything you do and amen to all that.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:52.280]  It's just that, you know, we are in a war for our minds and our lives alike.
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:56.640]  In 2010, that, you know, we're pretty important. The obliteration of the
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:44:01.880]  Constitution has been going on for so long. I mean, 4th, 10th, 2nd Amendment, just
[01:44:01.880 --> 01:44:06.920]  hammered away and now saying that it doesn't have any binding power. It's
[01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:12.440]  ridiculous. The President's the TSA. I mean, they're everywhere now. And, you
[01:44:12.440 --> 01:44:17.800]  know, just outrageous what's going on. Biggest event in the world is probably the
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:23.960]  dollar value dropping. And, you know, Mr. Porter's 10th area's predictions for
[01:44:23.960 --> 01:44:30.360]  2011, probably, you know, likely it's going to come around 2011, 2012. And
[01:44:30.360 --> 01:44:34.360]  biggest thing for 2011 though is hopefully the rate of people standing up.
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:38.920]  Like I've been saying, so long just waking up as one part and going out and
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:43.640]  actually doing something is, is way more important. You know, I tried as much as I
[01:44:43.640 --> 01:44:49.600]  can to get the word out. And people are just so, you know, what was that, that
[01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:56.520]  Stenberg was saying, normalcy, something, you know, they just don't want to believe it.
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:45:02.160]  It's ridiculous. Well said, Chris. Appreciate your call. But have you noticed that
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:08.320]  whenever we stand up and speak out and fight back, they back off just like with
[01:45:08.320 --> 01:45:11.320]  the TSA. They back off for a while because when we're ready to give them a
[01:45:11.320 --> 01:45:15.280]  fight, they don't want to give us a chance to have a victory. They want to back
[01:45:15.280 --> 01:45:21.360]  off and then creep back up in the dark of night. And it's the same thing. I mean,
[01:45:21.360 --> 01:45:25.200]  if they really start trying to arrest people like myself, if they really start
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:30.280]  trying to go after Ron Paul and others, that is only going to cause more people
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:35.000]  to realize just how serious the situation is and to stand up. They're hoping
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:40.920]  that we operate psychologically like them. That's why they don't mind that it's
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:44.320]  in the news that Ron Paul is being spied on as a potential terrorist. You know,
[01:45:44.320 --> 01:45:48.480]  not just, oh, it's a sign you might be a terrorist. If you like Ron Paul, no,
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:53.720]  let's spy on Ron Paul. Let's spy on his organization. Let's spy on the ACLU and
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:58.720]  list them as potential terrorists. I mean, that is just outrageous, but they
[01:45:58.720 --> 01:46:03.840]  need it to be outrageous to set that precedent. I mean, they've got to get
[01:46:03.840 --> 01:46:07.440]  all those cops behind closed doors and those fusion centers and sit there with
[01:46:07.440 --> 01:46:13.080]  a straight face like FEMA did in 2000. I have video shot by a firefighter. It's
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:16.480]  in road to tyranny with the police and firefighters and sheriff's deputies and
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:19.960]  they get right up and say, who's the original terrorist organization, the
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:24.640]  founding fathers? Who's bad? George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, the cops
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:31.080]  even know how to answer. And they, you know, have Homeland Security spying on
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:36.640]  legislators. Uh, and they say this legislature in Pennsylvania wants to cut
[01:46:36.640 --> 01:46:41.360]  taxes. That will cut money to the government. That's against our interest.
[01:46:41.880 --> 01:46:46.720]  That's a threat to Homeland Security. Here's an example. My mother has a
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:52.640]  longtime college friend who I've known my whole life. Nice lady works for a big
[01:46:52.640 --> 01:47:00.000]  fortune, 500 for decades, you know, successful, mid-level executive. And my
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.640]  mother went to Europe, whether a month or so ago for a week, they like to go to
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:07.280]  the museums and
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:15.120]  they tried to mail back an advent calendar. And my kids get a man like a
[01:47:15.120 --> 01:47:19.800]  little piece of chocolate for every day leading up to Christmas in the month of
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:26.440]  December and they tried to mail it as a present to some of her family. So you
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:30.560]  have to carry it around with her in Europe. They bought it in Germany and
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:34.840]  some of the advent calendars, only some of them from this big popular German
[01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:38.360]  company. My mom told me the name. Most people will know the name. It's kinder
[01:47:38.360 --> 01:47:45.440]  something. Some of the advent calendars of the hundreds they put out only in
[01:47:45.440 --> 01:47:49.200]  like one of the little boxes have like a little top or a little ball, little toy.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:57.680]  Some of them aren't candies. They're toys. And because a child might be able to
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:04.440]  choke, it's a band toy in the U.S. An adult can't buy that chocolate box that
[01:48:04.440 --> 01:48:09.720]  has a toy in it for yourself. Now, see, that sounds crazy. It sounds bureaucratic.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:13.640]  It sounds dumb. She got a letter from Homeland Security saying, we confiscated.
[01:48:13.640 --> 01:48:18.600]  It was expensive, by the way, your advent calendar because some models of this
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:25.400]  have toys that could be a choking hazard. No judge, no jury, no law, admiralty law.
[01:48:25.400 --> 01:48:29.640]  And you're like, well, that just sounds silly and stupid. No, no, it's about all
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:34.800]  commerce being seized by them. It's about all commerce being controlled. It's
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:38.800]  about Homeland Security running every facet of life. Remember that article in
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:44.400]  Fox News? AP also covered it last year. $15 million fines. In fact, people won't
[01:48:44.400 --> 01:48:50.520]  believe it. Pull it up. $15 million fines for garage sale. My mind can't even get
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:56.400]  wrapped around that. And it says, first time you're caught having a garage sale
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:49:01.280]  that's unauthorized by the feds, $10,000 fine. Next time a million. Next time
[01:49:01.280 --> 01:49:07.360]  15 million. And how do they do it? They say, if you're selling in your garage sale,
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:14.080]  your bizarre, your flea market, your gun show, any recalled toy, and there's tens of
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:19.240]  thousands of them in going back decades, you will be fined millions of dollars.
[01:49:19.240 --> 01:49:26.880]  So it's always in safety. Oh, it's for your safety. Okay, now you can drink all
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:29.960]  the bisphenol a drinks you want. You can drink all the fluoride you want, all the
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:34.000]  deadly vaccines. That's great. You can have hundreds of thousands of deaths from
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:37.200]  drug interactions. They push on you hundreds of thousands of deaths from
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:40.640]  bacteria killing people there in his new government policy and poses strict
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:50.880]  standards on garage sales nationwide. $15 million fine. There it is. That was
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:50:03.760]  September 18, 2009. So a year and a half ago. Now, this is the tyranny. The TSA is
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:11.280]  not there to stop little men with AK 47s. It is not there to stop Muslim extremist.
[01:50:13.440 --> 01:50:16.800]  The globalists pump every amount of money and funding they can into the most
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:20.720]  nutty Muslim groups they can. They hold their hand. They try to get them to
[01:50:20.720 --> 01:50:25.680]  attack 24 seven and all they can get is 18 year old street kids and people
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:30.720]  literally borderline mentally retarded. That's all they can do. Now, suddenly
[01:50:30.720 --> 01:50:35.440]  the terror threat is a bunch of morons who were recruited in prison with names
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:42.560]  like Johnson and Martinez. But nine years ago, it was like Star Wars level
[01:50:42.560 --> 01:50:49.120]  attack. Super high tech. I mean, do you believe any of this? So homeland
[01:50:49.120 --> 01:50:54.000]  security is seizing everything and they're going to come after everybody.
[01:50:54.000 --> 01:50:58.320]  Okay. We'll be right back with more of your phone calls and after we got Bob
[01:50:58.320 --> 01:51:02.160]  Chapman coming on in Max Kaiser. Stay with us. Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:51:02.160 --> 01:51:05.840]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non hybrid seeds and secret
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:09.520]  storage vaults near the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown,
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:13.440]  non hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true. Seeds
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:16.800]  have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:20.560]  that could even happen again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have
[01:51:20.560 --> 01:51:24.960]  put together the perfect mix of non hybrid seeds. They call it a survival
[01:51:24.960 --> 01:51:29.440]  seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:32.720]  for you and your family. And here's the best part. These seeds have not been
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:36.640]  genetically modified in any way and you actually get enough seeds to plant a
[01:51:36.640 --> 01:51:41.600]  full acre crisis garden. So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:48.400]  That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:51:48.400 --> 01:51:56.240]  That's 877-327-0365. Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:00.800]  ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:00.800 --> 01:52:03.920]  Calling all manufacturers from across the United States.

[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:48.080]  what are our resolutions? My New Year's resolution last year was to lose
[01:54:48.080 --> 01:54:52.080]  50 pounds. I only lost 25. I'm gonna lose that additional 25 this
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:56.480]  year. You know, personally, to spend more time
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:54:59.200]  with my family while at the same time putting out more info against the
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:02.560]  globalist. But what about simple resolutions? Like to
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:07.200]  reach out to somebody with liberty, to reach out to somebody with the truth,
[01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:10.560]  to reach out to somebody with a warning about the corruption
[01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:17.120]  every day. We should all do that. I do it at 7-11. I do it at gas stations.
[01:55:17.120 --> 01:55:21.520]  I do it at the grocery store. I talk to people.
[01:55:21.520 --> 01:55:24.800]  That's important. They want us in our houses watching our glowing
[01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:29.200]  television sets. I would say make the resolution this year.
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:33.200]  Talking to somebody is effective, but the most effective, the majority of
[01:55:33.200 --> 01:55:37.120]  people that come to this radio show, the majority of people I talk to who say
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:42.160]  they've been awakened, were awakened with one of my 25 films.
[01:55:42.160 --> 01:55:47.200]  They're all online. They're at prisonplanet.tv in super high quality.
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.480]  You can get the DVDs, make copies, follow the republic,
[01:55:50.480 --> 01:55:54.960]  in-game, and visible empire. They're all available at infowars.com.
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:57.920]  And I know you're supporting us, but please continue to make the resolution
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:01.360]  this year to support the info war. And who can doubt?
[01:56:01.360 --> 01:56:05.040]  We're not perfect, but we do the best we can. Who can doubt? It's a big
[01:56:05.040 --> 01:56:08.560]  responsibility. We're at the tip of the spear right here on this radio
[01:56:08.560 --> 01:56:11.760]  broadcast. And I talk to many other prominent people
[01:56:11.760 --> 01:56:18.640]  like Ron Paul and countless others, and they say the number one
[01:56:18.640 --> 01:56:23.200]  ping they get is this show from people out there on the street.
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:26.080]  This is the show with the buzz. This is the broadcast
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:29.040]  having the effect. This is the broadcast breaking through the
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:32.080]  electronic Berlin Wall because of you spreading the word,
[01:56:32.080 --> 01:56:36.000]  and because of the powerful info we lay out here and the great job my crew does.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:39.760]  All of us together. And that's why the attacks, no doubt, are going to
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:44.160]  intensify because of jealousy, but also because of government
[01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:48.560]  manipulation and mainstream attacks. It's only going to intensify. And I
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:51.920]  just pray going into the new year that the good Lord above,
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:54.800]  you know, take those lemons and turn them into lemonade
[01:56:54.800 --> 01:56:59.680]  as has always been in the past. And we're just going to put one foot in
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:05.760]  front of the other and move forward. Let's talk to who's up next here, John.
[01:57:05.760 --> 01:57:10.560]  Caroline in Australia. Thanks for holding. You're on the air, Caroline.
[01:57:10.560 --> 01:57:15.520]  Woo! Alex, you're awesome. We've been waiting up here. This is our new year's
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:18.000]  resolution. It's me and Richard. We're here. We've
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:22.240]  been waiting up all night to speak to you, so it's so exciting.
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:26.320]  Well, thanks for putting up with me. Wow. Go ahead.
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:29.360]  Okay. Well, I've got a question that I'm going to hand you over to Richard.
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:33.200]  My question is, like, in Australia, like, what do you forecast? Because
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:35.920]  I've heard that they're going to introduce a police base here, but I don't
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:38.400]  see how it's physically possible because we're a really
[01:57:38.400 --> 01:57:44.320]  vast, vast, vast nation with only 24 million people. And so it's not
[01:57:44.320 --> 01:57:47.680]  really, it's not really physically possible. Do you know what I mean to monitor
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:52.960]  results? I'll take my question off the air. I'm handing over to Richard now.
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:56.320]  Hey, Richard. It's our new year in America and the world.
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:58:01.280]  Hey, how are you doing? The big story for me is the exposure at
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:04.880]  Silver. I'm a big fan of a guy called Big Swear,
[01:58:04.880 --> 01:58:08.240]  Deruda Theory. The Silver thing is going to crack up in
[01:58:08.240 --> 01:58:11.760]  this whole thing, and everybody get ready. I reckon
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:16.000]  around April, April that time, things are going to come down,
[01:58:16.000 --> 01:58:19.920]  so get ready, and that's going to happen. So,
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:24.240]  happy new year to you all. Well, hold on, Richard. I'm going to hold you over
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:27.920]  because I want to hear you quantify, and I tend to agree with you, that this
[01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:31.920]  Silver thing is big. Silver's up 50 plus percent just in the
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:35.760]  last few months. We're going to come back, talk to you,
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:38.480]  talk to a few more callers, and Bob Chapman's coming on. We'll continue with
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:43.200]  Open Phones. We'll be right back. Are you tired of searching for great talk
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:46.720]  radio? Something more important. Search no more.
[01:58:46.720 --> 01:58:53.120]  We are the GCN Radio Network. A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:56.160]  that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[01:58:56.160 --> 01:59:00.640]  day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about
[01:59:00.640 --> 01:59:03.440]  our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate
[01:59:03.440 --> 01:59:06.720]  your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:59:06.720 --> 01:59:10.640]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part
[01:59:10.640 --> 01:59:14.400]  is, he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[01:59:14.400 --> 01:59:17.600]  Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest small owner, general growth
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:21.040]  properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:24.800]  prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:27.440]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:31.360]  and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least
[01:59:31.360 --> 01:59:34.720]  watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know,
[01:59:34.720 --> 01:59:38.320]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video
[01:59:38.320 --> 01:59:43.920]  at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America. The number three.

[02:00:13.920 --> 02:00:20.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:28.240]  Alex Jones. Via the wonders of technology, I take you now
[02:00:28.240 --> 02:00:35.360]  to the future, to 2011, to Australia, with Caroline
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:38.960]  and Richard who've called in. Bob Chapman's coming up. The calls will
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:41.440]  continue. Max Kaiser, as we go into the fourth hour
[02:00:41.440 --> 02:00:45.600]  today, will be joining us. It's been passed nine o'clock in France.
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:49.840]  But over in Australia, I want to answer Caroline's question. She
[02:00:49.840 --> 02:00:52.880]  asked the question and then handed the phone over to Richard. But first, before
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:56.560]  I do that, her question was how are they going to
[02:00:56.560 --> 02:00:59.520]  have a police state in Australia? And the answer is it's already going into
[02:00:59.520 --> 02:01:04.400]  place, and I'll illustrate that here in just a moment. But Richard, finishing up,
[02:01:04.400 --> 02:01:08.240]  yes, people buying silver, showing that the big banks have been
[02:01:08.240 --> 02:01:12.080]  shorting the market and manipulating physical.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:15.440]  That is really starting to become evident,
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:19.360]  and they are concerned about it. So give us your take on that.
[02:01:19.360 --> 02:01:24.960]  Well, it's a massive trend, and you know, like as much as I totally
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:28.960]  concur with your point of view on so many matters,
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:32.400]  I think that what will happen out of this is that
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:37.440]  there's just got to be a total reenlivenment of society from this.
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:39.760]  When this thing collapses and it's got to collapse,
[02:01:39.760 --> 02:01:43.440]  a bit like the, you know, the Muslim religion doesn't have
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:47.600]  usury or doesn't have interest. It just goes to nothingness. It is
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:50.480]  nothingness, and it gets back to a
[02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:55.200]  reality-based, community-based system. I mean, permaculture, all these ideas. I'm
[02:01:55.200 --> 02:01:58.640]  a vermiculturalist, meaning a worm farm. I'm about to roll out of a
[02:01:58.640 --> 02:02:01.920]  global worm farm business across the world with some Swedish
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:05.600]  and Swiss backing. You know, they're all into the metals and stuff.
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:08.160]  We all know what's going on. The world knows what's going on.
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:11.600]  Well, that's what I'm saying. Listen, listen. I can get off a street
[02:02:11.600 --> 02:02:15.120]  in Honduras. I can get off in Canada, England,
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:19.840]  and literally now it's not, oh, you know, walk down the street for 20 minutes,
[02:02:19.840 --> 02:02:25.440]  one listener comes over. Now it's a lot of people, and again, I'm just
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:28.960]  one indicator of that. People are really awake and it's
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:33.040]  accelerating. That's right, that's right, and look,
[02:02:33.040 --> 02:02:37.040]  you know, it's just something that is just going to
[02:02:37.040 --> 02:02:41.040]  overwhelm these guys. I mean, I put it down, not to use
[02:02:41.040 --> 02:02:45.360]  two better words. We're going to say two big elephants. One's called
[02:02:45.360 --> 02:02:49.120]  ethical capitalism. The other's called debt-based servitude capitalism.
[02:02:49.120 --> 02:02:52.160]  Debt-based servitude capitalism is about to be crushed.
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:55.200]  It's getting old. It's about to die to the other elephant.
[02:02:55.200 --> 02:02:59.600]  It's the only other way we can go out of the war.
[02:02:59.600 --> 02:03:04.000]  Well, you said it very well, beautifully said. I wish I was that eloquent.
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:07.520]  Good to hear from you. Very exciting, Richard, and God bless you.
[02:03:07.520 --> 02:03:11.280]  In Carolina, I hope you too are having a great time in the early morning hours.
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:13.520]  I'm sure you're drinking a few Guinness over there
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:16.800]  to help you through the very painful evening,
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:19.680]  but getting serious to answer her question. This is what they've done in
[02:03:19.680 --> 02:03:23.520]  Australia. They staged some shootings, what was it,
[02:03:23.520 --> 02:03:27.680]  12 years ago, 13 years ago, and it came out they were staged.
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.200]  They did a few stunts like they went and killed Crocodile Dundee,
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:35.280]  the real Crocodile Dundee. He looks just like the actor.
[02:03:35.280 --> 02:03:38.160]  They went to his house, he wouldn't turn his guns in, killed him.
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:41.280]  He killed a few of the cops in the process.
[02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:46.800]  They banned a lot of guns. I can play the newscast where they've taken
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:53.120]  half, it was right at half, of the forest, 40% of the farmland,
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:58.880]  off use with the carbon taxes. They just said, you've owned this sheep farm
[02:03:58.880 --> 02:04:01.680]  in your family for over 100 years, in one case.
[02:04:01.680 --> 02:04:06.080]  Guy was doing a hunger strike. I never saw how that ended up on a tower.
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:12.400]  They just say, sorry, no more. They say to pass our carbon credits
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:17.360]  and internationally, we're going to take half the forest, 40% of the grassland,
[02:04:17.360 --> 02:04:20.800]  off use. Now, they tried to implement it. People
[02:04:20.800 --> 02:04:24.720]  revolted, the government got thrown out, and so they said, okay, we're only
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:27.920]  coming back then with part of that. No, you've got to get rid of all of it.
[02:04:27.920 --> 02:04:31.840]  See, they always say, oh, we'll compromise, just give us a little.
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:34.960]  We'll compromise, give us a little, but they never get pushed back.
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:37.920]  They're putting in the high-tech grids, you've got political correctness,
[02:04:37.920 --> 02:04:41.440]  they're bringing in foreigners. Not that foreigners are bad
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:45.200]  themselves, but they're brought in to be your cops and your rulers. Look at
[02:04:45.200 --> 02:04:47.680]  Sidney, I've looked at that. You've got a bunch of foreigners
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:51.280]  ruling over you, same thing here. You know, they bring them in from dictatorships
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:55.360]  and they love it. So, you got tyranny over there just like
[02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:58.080]  we do, and you got a lot of other stuff going on, but
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:01.840]  Aussies are great people and you're waking up.
[02:05:02.640 --> 02:05:06.240]  Hi, this is Alex Jones. You've heard me talk about the delicious,
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:10.080]  easy to fix, and very storable foods from eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:14.160]  I've told you for years that eFoods Direct has the best storable food on the
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:16.960]  planet. Now it's that time of year again, and their

[02:05:29.280 --> 02:05:33.200]  and the second is a five-week supply of quick and easy to fix meals,
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:36.880]  including delicious bakery items, shipped in heavy tote bags.

[02:05:51.040 --> 02:05:58.960]  That's 800-409-5633, or eFoodsDirect.com forward slash Alex.
[02:06:01.600 --> 02:06:05.600]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:06:05.600 --> 02:06:09.840]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this
[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:12.800]  agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath
[02:06:12.800 --> 02:06:16.000]  Americans at home. I have a tremendous influence
[02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:20.000]  on our president and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:25.280]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:28.480]  For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation,
[02:06:28.480 --> 02:06:32.880]  the criminal offshore cartel hell-bent on destroying sovereignty
[02:06:32.880 --> 02:06:35.360]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:39.200]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches,
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:41.760]  and the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[02:06:41.760 --> 02:06:46.080]  Today seems like nobody does care, and right now in Washington, D.C.,
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:51.120]  we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:55.760]  on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now
[02:06:55.760 --> 02:07:00.240]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.

[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:30.400]  Just throw him out at Bob and get his take on it.
[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:33.520]  I mean, some real lawlessness by the government.
[02:08:33.520 --> 02:08:37.520]  And every day I'm pinching myself like I'm dreaming. I cannot
[02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:42.880]  believe that Congress did not pass the new greenhouse gas takeover.
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:45.920]  I mean, I'm glad they didn't pass it. I knew we could beat it.
[02:08:45.920 --> 02:08:49.200]  That's not my, that's not what I mean by that.
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:53.760]  I can't believe that they didn't pass it. And then
[02:08:53.760 --> 02:08:57.200]  the EPA came into Texas and said we're going to
[02:08:57.200 --> 02:08:59.840]  basically start shutting down your power plants.
[02:08:59.840 --> 02:09:03.600]  We're going to issue new permitting standards that are impossible to comply
[02:09:03.600 --> 02:09:10.400]  with. I mean, that is amazing. Totally lawless.
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:13.840]  Just like Dr. Paul Craig Roberts said 30 minutes ago,
[02:09:13.840 --> 02:09:17.520]  and I did see this in the news last week,
[02:09:17.520 --> 02:09:21.440]  Gates, the head of the Defense Department, said we don't care if polls show
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:24.640]  two thirds, 60 plus percent are against the war.
[02:09:24.640 --> 02:09:27.680]  And those are even spun polls. It's worse than that. It's got to be in the
[02:09:27.680 --> 02:09:32.640]  high 70s or against the Afghan war. I mean, every former special forces commander
[02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:36.960]  like Anthony Schaefer I have on is against it
[02:09:36.960 --> 02:09:40.800]  because there is no objective. There's no public objective
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:44.640]  because the real objective is a black hole for trillions in opium,
[02:09:44.640 --> 02:09:48.800]  trillions in weapon sales over the last decade. It's coming up on that.
[02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:51.600]  We're hearing about eight, nine months. It'll be a decade.
[02:09:51.600 --> 02:09:55.200]  And about controlling the natural gas in that area,
[02:09:55.200 --> 02:09:58.960]  more than there even is in the United States. What was the last estimate at the
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:02.320]  time of 9-11? Four trillion in natural gas, not counting
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:05.040]  oil. And now in inflation, I guess that's more
[02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:09.600]  like six, seven trillion. So this is a lawless, out-of-control
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:12.480]  government. We're going to talk about that. But I want to do this a little
[02:10:12.480 --> 02:10:15.360]  different. We always wait to take calls the last 10,
[02:10:15.360 --> 02:10:18.880]  15 minutes with Bob. Then we've got to hurry through them. I know Bob loves
[02:10:18.880 --> 02:10:22.240]  taking calls, so my new year is present for him
[02:10:22.240 --> 02:10:25.920]  as we'll go to calls right away. But briefly, Bob, what do you think some of
[02:10:25.920 --> 02:10:32.240]  the most important issues of 2010 were and what do you see coming up in 2011?
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:36.960]  Well, I think 2010 more or less speaks for itself.
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:41.600]  It was a dreadful year, but it's going to be worse this coming year.
[02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:45.840]  And I think the scandals that were exposed
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:55.600]  are high on the list. We just had Mr. Ratner pay a $10 million fine for
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:11:02.000]  getting payoffs. We have the FBI chasing down scores of people
[02:11:02.000 --> 02:11:10.000]  and putting them under prosecution. The criminality is rife
[02:11:10.000 --> 02:11:13.040]  all through the corporate world, unfortunately.
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:16.640]  And I don't have to tell you about the politicians
[02:11:16.640 --> 02:11:24.480]  and the people on Wall Street who are deeply implicated
[02:11:24.480 --> 02:11:29.120]  in the takedowns that are going on now and inside a trading.
[02:11:29.120 --> 02:11:33.360]  But it's going to grow much bigger than that.
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:40.720]  Because they're going after J.P. Morgan Chase and HSBC,
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:44.320]  about 30 class action lawsuits, one of them RICO,
[02:11:44.320 --> 02:11:51.920]  and now they've got a class action against the silver ETF, SLV.
[02:11:51.920 --> 02:11:55.680]  It should be held to pop in this coming year because a lot of these cases are
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:59.760]  going to drag over for one or two years. So corruption,
[02:11:59.760 --> 02:12:04.080]  number one. Number two, the manipulation of markets.
[02:12:04.080 --> 02:12:08.320]  We're looking at a Dow that's trading at 11,600.
[02:12:08.320 --> 02:12:12.800]  It shouldn't be. Everybody in the country is catching on.
[02:12:12.800 --> 02:12:16.720]  Who's an investor that the markets are rigged? And it's got to stop.
[02:12:16.720 --> 02:12:21.360]  We have to have free enterprise. We have to have free and open markets.
[02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:24.400]  That's not what we got. We got corporate as fascism.
[02:12:24.400 --> 02:12:28.480]  And that's what the Federal Reserve and its owners
[02:12:28.480 --> 02:12:32.320]  and its figure had been Bernanke or all about.
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:37.600]  Just because he came from an ivory tower doesn't mean he doesn't know how
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:42.000]  to operate like the mob. Well, we saw a lot of other things happen.
[02:12:42.000 --> 02:12:47.760]  We saw the WikiLeaks this year. We saw Madoff come and go.
[02:12:47.760 --> 02:12:52.560]  I mean, we have just seen so much happen. But do you agree with me that
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:58.080]  this has been the greatest acceleration of awakening in 2010 we've ever seen
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:02.400]  to the Federal Reserve, the New World Order, to the TSA?
[02:13:02.400 --> 02:13:05.920]  I mean, that's when people really have stopped laughing at folks that talk about
[02:13:05.920 --> 02:13:09.520]  corruption and they either say, yeah, let's fight it or
[02:13:09.520 --> 02:13:12.560]  there's nothing you can do about it. But at least
[02:13:12.560 --> 02:13:16.400]  no matter what their attitude is, they admit there's a serious problem.
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:21.680]  That is very positive. The recognition process and that's what you
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:26.320]  and others who have programs like yours are pointing out.
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:30.240]  And that's what the internet is bringing to us, the WikiLeaks and
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:35.440]  the extension of that and how they went about it,
[02:13:35.440 --> 02:13:40.720]  the quality of what they came out with. But it's an ongoing process
[02:13:40.720 --> 02:13:45.200]  and we are making great strides. The coming year,
[02:13:45.200 --> 02:13:48.480]  gold and silver are going to go through the roof. The market will eventually go
[02:13:48.480 --> 02:13:52.960]  down. Interest rates unofficially will go a
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:56.640]  little higher. They'll try to hold them down as long as
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:14:00.720]  they can. And there's going to be some real surprises
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:04.400]  in the second half of the program. I'm going to talk about something that
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:07.040]  corporate America is trying to get away with.
[02:14:07.040 --> 02:14:11.520]  And it's the theft of almost $700 billion.
[02:14:11.520 --> 02:14:15.280]  And so that puts it in the the mega class.
[02:14:15.280 --> 02:14:20.640]  It certainly does. And with that, let's now go to your phone calls.
[02:14:20.640 --> 02:14:24.560]  Let's go ahead and talk to James in Michigan. You're on the air, James.
[02:14:24.560 --> 02:14:27.360]  Hey, how you doing, Alex and Bob Chapman? Good.
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:33.040]  Yeah, I just want to bring up about 10 and 11. 2010 was the year
[02:14:33.040 --> 02:14:38.880]  that we exposed whoop-up people, exposed the corruption,
[02:14:38.880 --> 02:14:43.440]  exposed that the government stepping over the constitution.
[02:14:43.440 --> 02:14:49.520]  And what needs to be done for 2011 is we need to get like a donation fund like
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:52.960]  the Alex Jones donation for liberty fund.
[02:14:52.960 --> 02:14:59.360]  And what that would do is put money in to use as far as
[02:14:59.360 --> 02:15:06.720]  like, not bonuses, but like funding for like people that will bring out the
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:11.200]  corruption of our government. As far as like,
[02:15:11.200 --> 02:15:16.240]  I can't think of a word, just like bonuses for people that do bring out
[02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:21.440]  like for instance, your father, where he got bribed by a dentist
[02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:25.200]  to join them. And that's what type of fund we should have
[02:15:25.200 --> 02:15:29.200]  to bring out the corruption as far as giving them, you know, bonuses for
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:33.600]  bringing stuff out like that. That's just in schizophrenic statement.
[02:15:33.600 --> 02:15:38.000]  I appreciate your call. My dad got bribed by a dentist.
[02:15:38.000 --> 02:15:41.520]  They like show some photo all over the internet of a guy named
[02:15:41.520 --> 02:15:48.080]  David Jones with bald head with gray hair about a foot taller than my dad.
[02:15:48.080 --> 02:15:51.600]  And then say that's my dad. I mean, it's just totally insane.
[02:15:51.600 --> 02:15:54.960]  But I mean, I appreciate it. I mean, it's whatever, man.
[02:15:54.960 --> 02:16:00.560]  Let's take another phone call here. Let's go ahead and talk to Don in
[02:16:00.560 --> 02:16:04.480]  Michigan. Don, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[02:16:04.480 --> 02:16:07.280]  Okay. How you doing Alex? Hope you have a good new year.
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:13.280]  Good. Go ahead. I just wanted to, I guess my biggest thoughts right now,
[02:16:13.280 --> 02:16:16.960]  and I try to jot them down before I will put you let me on there.
[02:16:16.960 --> 02:16:22.880]  City Council, I've listened to you for about a year and a half
[02:16:22.880 --> 02:16:28.400]  and I'm a hypocrite because I haven't done it yet, but today I printed out my
[02:16:28.400 --> 02:16:32.880]  City Council meeting and I want everybody to do that.
[02:16:32.880 --> 02:16:37.200]  Find out what time it is. It's only an hour a year day. Go listen to everybody.
[02:16:37.200 --> 02:16:45.200]  But as far as the gas prices, $4 to $5 a gallon, that was predicted, I think,
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:51.200]  on your show in October 22nd. I made somebody write it down at work
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:57.520]  and we can see that coming. So your show is just, the information is just
[02:16:57.520 --> 02:17:04.240]  incredible. I mean, the information is just spot on.
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:09.200]  And I saw, one thing I wanted to point out, as I saw on mainstream news today,
[02:17:09.200 --> 02:17:15.280]  excuse me, autism, 600% increase in 20 years.
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:19.120]  One in 110 kids. Now, if that doesn't tell people
[02:17:19.120 --> 02:17:23.600]  that evil things are being done, then you're just blind.
[02:17:23.600 --> 02:17:31.600]  You know, and miscarriages with the flu shots.
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:34.880]  Well, they always knew that flu shots increased miscarriages and you don't
[02:17:34.880 --> 02:17:38.640]  give them to pregnant women. Last year they said, this is just for women.
[02:17:38.640 --> 02:17:42.560]  Those are great points and I think Jaren just corrected me.
[02:17:42.560 --> 02:17:45.680]  I get defensive about family because I know how good they are and people have
[02:17:45.680 --> 02:17:49.920]  attacked my family and lied about them. I think the caller misunderstood a
[02:17:49.920 --> 02:17:55.120]  story I told last week and Jaren remembered that and I
[02:17:55.120 --> 02:17:59.360]  think Jaren was right. So I apologize to the last caller
[02:17:59.360 --> 02:18:04.800]  from Michigan before Don James. There's a whole conspiracy theory out
[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:09.280]  there that my dad hangs out with George W. Bush
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:12.240]  because there was a David Jones with a different middle name
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:18.400]  at a event in Houston years ago where they put a statue up and they just say
[02:18:18.400 --> 02:18:21.360]  that's his dad. That's him. He works with the Bushes.
[02:18:21.360 --> 02:18:24.400]  Of course, the people really wanted to talk about that. My dad has been in
[02:18:24.400 --> 02:18:28.160]  barbecue a couple times with George W. Bush because my sister went to the same
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:31.200]  school, private school here in Austin as his
[02:18:31.200 --> 02:18:35.440]  daughters did, but I mean I guess I'm guilty. I've told that story before but
[02:18:35.440 --> 02:18:38.560]  the caller was talking about Homeland Security,
[02:18:38.560 --> 02:18:44.560]  not another dentist. Not another dentist. I told the story last week
[02:18:44.560 --> 02:18:48.080]  and that'll get twisted around against me. It just doesn't matter. It's mental
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:52.480]  illness. I'm not by the caller but by others. My father was approached
[02:18:52.480 --> 02:18:57.040]  by Homeland Security, someone in Homeland Security, not another
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:19:01.280]  dentist. He was approached by Homeland Security
[02:19:01.280 --> 02:19:05.280]  to spy on people and it wasn't because he was my dad.
[02:19:05.280 --> 02:19:10.880]  They said we want to hire you. We're trying to hire basically all
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:14.960]  professionals and that's been in the news that it's InfraGuard and
[02:19:14.960 --> 02:19:18.480]  these citizen spy groups that they're doing this and then my dad went back in
[02:19:18.480 --> 02:19:23.360]  the lounge and told another dentist about it who
[02:19:23.360 --> 02:19:29.680]  by the way is a fan of my show, who's a good guy, Dr. King, and Dr. King said
[02:19:29.680 --> 02:19:34.000]  yeah I got approached two weeks ago by Homeland Security in my neighborhood,
[02:19:34.000 --> 02:19:36.960]  came and knocked on my door and tried to recruit me.
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:41.360]  So that's the story, not whatever they make up are mixed together.
[02:19:41.360 --> 02:19:44.400]  Okay we're gonna come back with Bob Chapman and more of your phone calls
[02:19:44.400 --> 02:19:47.200]  straight ahead and in fact I'll get Bob's brief take on that,
[02:19:47.200 --> 02:19:51.760]  that how many people must they be trying to recruit
[02:19:51.760 --> 02:19:55.520]  if in a dental office of four dentists two of the dentists have been hit up in
[02:19:55.520 --> 02:20:00.880]  the last month separately by different arms of Homeland Security.
[02:20:03.040 --> 02:20:06.720]  This is not a drill. Repeat. This is not a drill.
[02:20:06.720 --> 02:20:10.640]  Gun cells are on a staggering pace. Gun prices are going through the roof and
[02:20:10.640 --> 02:20:14.640]  that means desperate vicious criminals now want your guns and will do
[02:20:14.640 --> 02:20:18.080]  anything to get them. Now a new book reveals powerful secrets
[02:20:18.080 --> 02:20:21.600]  for hiding your guns from thieves and looters. You'll learn step by step
[02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:25.440]  battle-hardened techniques, where to hide your guns so criminals will never find
[02:20:25.440 --> 02:20:29.120]  them, how to create the perfect hiding place, as well as the places you should

[02:21:00.560 --> 02:21:04.640]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011
[02:21:04.640 --> 02:21:08.720]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:12.560]  He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel,
[02:21:12.560 --> 02:21:15.840]  invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and
[02:21:15.840 --> 02:21:18.400]  your own family. Now this man has made some outrageous
[02:21:18.400 --> 02:21:22.000]  predictions over the years. The crazy part is he's usually right.
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:26.080]  You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's
[02:21:26.080 --> 02:21:30.080]  biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his
[02:21:30.080 --> 02:21:33.600]  work a dire prophecy. Recently he created a video which you can
[02:21:33.600 --> 02:21:37.040]  watch online for free detailing his biggest and most important prediction
[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:41.440]  yet and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least
[02:21:41.440 --> 02:21:44.800]  watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know
[02:21:44.800 --> 02:21:48.400]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video
[02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:53.920]  at www.endofamerica3.com. That's End of America. The number three

[02:22:06.080 --> 02:22:09.760]  metal investing firms. I get it. You wouldn't buy gold if you believed
[02:22:09.760 --> 02:22:13.440]  that the government is doing a great job that the Fed will stop handing out
[02:22:13.440 --> 02:22:17.200]  trillions of dollars like bailout candy that social security would be there for
[02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:21.520]  you. That's not what's happening. You might even pass on gold if the stimulus
[02:22:21.520 --> 02:22:25.600]  package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that
[02:22:25.600 --> 02:22:29.760]  your retirement would be secure. If all looks rosy to you then now is not
[02:22:29.760 --> 02:22:33.200]  the time to buy gold. For the realists there have never been more sobering
[02:22:33.200 --> 02:22:38.480]  reasons to diversify with gold. Since 2001 the U.S. dollar index has tanked 30
[02:22:38.480 --> 02:22:43.200]  percent while gold has risen 300 percent. Right now savvy investors are adding gold

[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:15.680]  Max Geiser's coming up in about 35 minutes. We'll continue with open phones. Bob
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:19.120]  Chapman's got some big news to lay on you. I've got a lot of news I want to throw
[02:24:19.120 --> 02:24:22.960]  out at Bob and get his take on. But before we go back to calls,
[02:24:22.960 --> 02:24:26.400]  I mean Homeland Security admits that they're rolling out TSA on the streets
[02:24:26.400 --> 02:24:30.240]  of America, telescreens, now at 9,000 locations,
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:35.120]  tattletale squads. But it really hits home when they're
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:39.360]  not just trying to recruit the preachers, they're trying to recruit your dad.
[02:24:39.360 --> 02:24:42.640]  And then your dad goes and talks to a colleague and they're like, yeah, they
[02:24:42.640 --> 02:24:47.440]  tried to recruit me. I mean that is really creepy. That
[02:24:47.440 --> 02:24:52.000]  sounds like worse than the Stasi, Bob.
[02:24:52.000 --> 02:24:55.760]  Well, I was, you know, when you first said it, when we went off to the break,
[02:24:55.760 --> 02:24:59.040]  you know, right through my head right away was
[02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:04.800]  the NKVD, but and then the Stasi. You know, I know exactly what those people
[02:25:04.800 --> 02:25:09.680]  used to do and because we used to spy on them.
[02:25:09.680 --> 02:25:16.320]  And of course, after the war, you've got the Gestapo
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:20.640]  recruitment and Operation Paperclip and that was followed
[02:25:20.640 --> 02:25:24.800]  by the wall coming down. A deal was made to let everybody off the
[02:25:24.800 --> 02:25:27.920]  hook who was involved in that sort of thing in
[02:25:27.920 --> 02:25:32.320]  Eastern Germany. Previously, Marcus Wolf was responsible
[02:25:32.320 --> 02:25:35.920]  for the death of thousands and thousands of people
[02:25:35.920 --> 02:25:40.080]  and nothing was ever done to him. And then they brought
[02:25:40.080 --> 02:25:45.600]  to the United States experts from what used to be East Germany
[02:25:45.600 --> 02:25:48.880]  and the US recruited them to tell them how to do
[02:25:48.880 --> 02:25:52.160]  exactly what Homeland Security is doing today.
[02:25:52.160 --> 02:25:55.360]  And we reported that eight years ago, it was even in the mainstream news
[02:25:55.360 --> 02:25:58.400]  and people couldn't believe it. I mean, they're really
[02:25:58.400 --> 02:26:02.000]  doing it and already with dentists and doctors and nurses,
[02:26:02.000 --> 02:26:05.680]  it's like, oh, ask kids if their parents are abusing them
[02:26:05.680 --> 02:26:09.360]  preemptively, guilty until proven innocent and it's the same thing now
[02:26:09.360 --> 02:26:12.480]  worldwide. And once they've got them trained to spy on that,
[02:26:12.480 --> 02:26:15.920]  now it's, by the way, what's their political views? Well, I mean, who's going
[02:26:15.920 --> 02:26:19.200]  to watch the government, Bob? Who's going to keep control of the
[02:26:19.200 --> 02:26:22.720]  tyrants? Where's the Homeland Security to counterbalance
[02:26:22.720 --> 02:26:28.000]  Homeland Security? Well, if George Orwell were around,
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.000]  he would have his head in his hand saying, I never thought it would really get
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:36.160]  this bad and it's worse now. Well, the good news is, though,
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:39.120]  they're not able to just to arrest everybody at once.
[02:26:39.120 --> 02:26:42.800]  They're trying to set it up, but they're not really rolling out,
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:46.800]  moving against everybody yet. Sure, they tried to plant hand grenades on you.
[02:26:46.800 --> 02:26:50.960]  They've tried stuff like that with yours truly over and over again,
[02:26:50.960 --> 02:26:54.160]  but, you know, for the average person out there,
[02:26:54.160 --> 02:26:58.160]  they're not going to really do anything to you folks. We're invincible. We've got
[02:26:58.160 --> 02:27:01.920]  the numbers. That's why they're trying to get all these spies
[02:27:01.920 --> 02:27:06.640]  because they want those numbers, but they're not going to get it.
[02:27:06.640 --> 02:27:11.680]  They're trying to build a giant database. I mean, look what they're doing
[02:27:11.680 --> 02:27:16.160]  and this is a trial run with people who are citizens of Mexico. If you want to
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:19.360]  go to the United States now, you have to have
[02:27:19.360 --> 02:27:24.880]  a visa, but you have to be biometrically eyeballed
[02:27:24.880 --> 02:27:29.040]  and you have to have your fingerprints. But then if you're an illegal, they just
[02:27:29.040 --> 02:27:31.920]  leave you alone, though. It's the folks that want to do it right that they
[02:27:31.920 --> 02:27:36.720]  harass. That's right, and they're building a database
[02:27:36.720 --> 02:27:42.640]  and, of course, the president, we'll call it a regime that's in power in Mexico,
[02:27:42.640 --> 02:27:46.480]  is going right along with the program because they're in office because
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:51.920]  the election was rigged and the neocons came in and rigged it for them,
[02:27:51.920 --> 02:27:54.480]  and they're not going to get away with it again.
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:57.600]  And that's even come out in the Dallas Morning News of all places at the same
[02:27:57.600 --> 02:28:02.720]  folks that run Bush's operation. George W were running it down in Mexico, and
[02:28:02.720 --> 02:28:06.240]  in Mexico, they make the attorney general's employees take microchips.
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:10.000]  That's six years old. They, what, two years ago made it where
[02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:13.600]  all cell phones are tracked in live time and you can't have a track
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:17.120]  phone. They don't have gun ownership. What do you
[02:28:17.120 --> 02:28:20.080]  make of this? We're going to break them back with calls,
[02:28:20.080 --> 02:28:23.440]  where the feds are now ordering border states with no law,
[02:28:23.440 --> 02:28:27.440]  Bob, to report more than one semi-automatic
[02:28:27.440 --> 02:28:32.720]  handgunner rifle being sold. I mean, that's
[02:28:32.720 --> 02:28:35.840]  that's extrajudicial. They're just doing that without law,
[02:28:35.840 --> 02:28:39.520]  and it's the same thing with the EPA. The Congress wouldn't pass their greenhouse
[02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:42.640]  gas takeover, so they're just doing it, and they've now
[02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:46.960]  seized control of the Texas permitting process with no authority,
[02:28:46.960 --> 02:28:51.840]  and literally will shut down many of the power plants in Texas,
[02:28:51.840 --> 02:28:55.440]  and they have no force of law behind them. They're just doing it.
[02:28:55.440 --> 02:29:00.880]  They just do what they want to do, and I'm afraid we've said that on this program
[02:29:00.880 --> 02:29:04.880]  innumerable times, and they're going to continue
[02:29:04.880 --> 02:29:09.200]  to just stay outside the law and do it until people
[02:29:09.200 --> 02:29:12.240]  bring legal action against them, counties, cities,
[02:29:12.240 --> 02:29:17.440]  say, no, we're not going to do that. And once you have one case, it's over,
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:22.720]  because they'll have to stop. But it's the process that you have to go through.
[02:29:22.720 --> 02:29:27.920]  It's just like the regulatory agencies, the CFTC and the SEC.
[02:29:27.920 --> 02:29:33.280]  You file a complaint, they're arrogant, nasty, and never follow up on it.
[02:29:33.280 --> 02:29:40.240]  All they do is protect the ensconced bankers, veteran Wall Street, etc.
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:43.120]  Well, you said it. We know there was a Bilderberg group deal two years ago
[02:29:43.120 --> 02:29:46.400]  struck in Turkey dealing with Texas power plants. I'll tell
[02:29:46.400 --> 02:29:49.680]  folks about that when we come back.
[02:29:51.120 --> 02:29:55.040]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.040 --> 02:30:00.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:30:00.000 --> 02:30:03.840]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:30:03.840 --> 02:30:07.920]  solar power generator. Number one, new climate legislation could easily
[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:11.840]  double or triple your electric bill. Number two, our new energy czar wants
[02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:15.280]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:30:15.280 --> 02:30:19.520]  It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:30:19.520 --> 02:30:23.120]  technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country,
[02:30:23.120 --> 02:30:27.600]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now new socialist legislation
[02:30:27.600 --> 02:30:31.440]  is only compounding the problem. Number four, dangerous weather is always a
[02:30:31.440 --> 02:30:34.640]  threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose
[02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:38.560]  their power from weather-related onages. Number five, a solar power generator
[02:30:38.560 --> 02:30:41.440]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:30:41.440 --> 02:30:44.480]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from
[02:30:44.480 --> 02:30:47.920]  Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at

[02:33:09.040 --> 02:33:18.480]  We are on the march. The empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[02:33:18.480 --> 02:33:22.240]  All right, I'm going to take some more of your calls and get into the big news. Bob's
[02:33:22.240 --> 02:33:26.880]  going to break here today, and we're going to talk to Max Kaiser coming up the next
[02:33:26.880 --> 02:33:32.080]  hour. Continue with your phone calls here on our last broadcast of 2010.
[02:33:32.080 --> 02:33:36.160]  I'll be back Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. with the first broadcast of 2011,
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:41.120]  but I wanted to tell you about a wonderful sponsors that make this broadcast possible.
[02:33:42.000 --> 02:33:46.400]  One of them is End of America, the number three dot com.
[02:33:46.400 --> 02:33:50.800]  Stansbury and Associates Investment Research is an independent investment research fund
[02:33:51.520 --> 02:33:57.600]  firm founded in 1999 with subscribers in more than 100 different countries. Again,
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:02.720]  Stansbury and Associates Investment Research is an independent investment research firm
[02:34:02.720 --> 02:34:06.880]  founded in 1999 with subscribers in more than 100 different countries.
[02:34:06.880 --> 02:34:10.640]  They recently created an eye-opening video that you can see at endofamerica, the number
[02:34:10.640 --> 02:34:14.960]  three dot com for free, detailing their biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:34:15.920 --> 02:34:22.400]  And it goes on the website is endofamerica, the number three dot com. Excellent information.
[02:34:22.400 --> 02:34:26.240]  And if you missed that, there's banners up on infowars.com and prisonpana.com.
[02:34:26.880 --> 02:34:31.360]  And finally, inner food, wonderful super food. We live in a toxic environment.
[02:34:31.360 --> 02:34:36.160]  Daily, we are bombarded with the chemtrails, the fluorides, the pesticides,
[02:34:38.720 --> 02:34:43.680]  battling a sneeze there for the last minute, folks. And other equally toxic chemicals.
[02:34:45.280 --> 02:34:49.360]  It's very important that people understand that most of the vitamins you eat just get
[02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:54.640]  passed through you. But with super food, non-pasturized 20 super foods in their inner food product,
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:34:58.640]  just one of their great products, you absorb almost all of it instead of just passing it
[02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:05.520]  through you. The website is enerfood.com, innerfood.com. They have some specials and some Alex Jones
[02:35:05.520 --> 02:35:09.360]  combos for listeners so you can get discounts. So be sure and look for those on the side or
[02:35:09.360 --> 02:35:20.000]  also when you call 866-762-9238, 866-762-9238. And don't forget good old Bob Chapman with

[02:35:39.040 --> 02:35:47.360]  Just briefly, some of the main players at the 2007, so I guess it's three years ago now,
[02:35:47.360 --> 02:36:01.440]  a Bilderberg group meeting that was held over in Istanbul, over in Turkey, were big players
[02:36:01.440 --> 02:36:07.680]  trying to take over the power plants in Texas. And Rick Perry's been involved in that so he was
[02:36:07.680 --> 02:36:12.080]  taken to the meeting and he was a guest at the meeting and now he's gearing up to run for president.
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:19.360]  The more he denies it, the more you know that's going to happen. And there's big money in shutting
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:26.560]  down smaller regional power plant systems and only letting the biggies operate and that's what
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:33.760]  this EPA takeover is about. And Texas produces more power than any other state. It's the second
[02:36:33.760 --> 02:36:40.160]  most populous state, but it supplies power to surrounding states and they're really trying
[02:36:40.160 --> 02:36:46.160]  to shut it down and it's very clean. The government has aircraft that fly around in Sestans every day
[02:36:46.160 --> 02:36:51.680]  above the power plants. If they pick up any pollutants, they go absolutely ape. It's what
[02:36:51.680 --> 02:36:55.840]  supplies our power. Now China has none of these controls on them. They're building several new
[02:36:55.840 --> 02:37:02.080]  power plants a week. We only build a few a year that get permitted. This is a military style
[02:37:02.080 --> 02:37:11.760]  takeover of globalism to shut off our industry. Bob, I have to say though, Perry since then has stood
[02:37:11.760 --> 02:37:17.920]  up against the takeover of the power plants and so has the attorney general. And now the feds have
[02:37:17.920 --> 02:37:23.920]  come in, as I talked about earlier and said, we're going to have federal permitting now.
[02:37:23.920 --> 02:37:28.320]  We're revoking the state's right to issue permits when that's outside their jurisdiction,
[02:37:28.320 --> 02:37:32.880]  but the EPA is trying to enforce something that they couldn't get Congress to pass.
[02:37:32.880 --> 02:37:37.120]  I mean, this is an impeachable offense on its face. Is it not?
[02:37:38.240 --> 02:37:48.400]  It certainly is. And this is the policy model of corporatist fascism, the agglomeration
[02:37:50.400 --> 02:37:57.040]  of everything in every sphere into a monopoly. All the power projects that are operating the
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:01.760]  country and any that are going to be built, they want to control them all. All of the
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:07.200]  production of automobiles in the United States, they want to control them all. The building of
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:13.840]  homes, they've been in negotiations for over two years with some major builders
[02:38:14.640 --> 02:38:22.400]  to consolidate the industry into a half dozen producers of homes. And what better time when
[02:38:22.400 --> 02:38:29.520]  the whole housing business is in trouble and will continue to be. And they're going to do the same
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:39.520]  thing in banking and in Wall Street and in many, many spheres. And this is an evolutionary
[02:38:39.520 --> 02:38:49.120]  process which is assisted by key cynicism, which to me is nothing more than an economic and monetary
[02:38:49.120 --> 02:38:58.480]  plan for the imposition of a fascist government. This is what this all leads to.
[02:39:00.640 --> 02:39:05.200]  Well, you're absolutely right. Let's continue with calls and get into your big news and some
[02:39:05.200 --> 02:39:09.120]  other items that are very important I want to cover. Matt in Florida, you're on the air with
[02:39:09.120 --> 02:39:15.680]  Bob Chapman. Thanks for holding. I'd like to wish you a happy New Year's Eve. I have a few
[02:39:15.680 --> 02:39:21.360]  quick points I wanted to run through real quick. For 2010, I wanted to thank the Obama administration
[02:39:21.360 --> 02:39:27.920]  for really throwing the socialism in our face to help us wake up more people once they realize
[02:39:27.920 --> 02:39:33.120]  what he truly was. I want to let you know, I want to thank you for breaking that story about the
[02:39:33.120 --> 02:39:40.320]  Tampa Police Department yesterday. We Are Changed Tampa is planning a peaceable assembly at the
[02:39:40.320 --> 02:39:47.280]  Tampa Police Headquarters on this upcoming Tuesday at three o'clock. So anybody who'd like to join
[02:39:47.280 --> 02:39:54.240]  us out there in the Tampa area, you're welcome to. I wanted to tell you I'm looking forward to
[02:39:54.960 --> 02:40:03.920]  9-11-11, the 10th anniversary of 9-11. I'm sure there's going to be some big things going on that
[02:40:03.920 --> 02:40:10.000]  day as far as trying to get 9-11 truth. And I wanted to let you know that if you want to come
[02:40:10.000 --> 02:40:16.800]  out and film for police state five, you can bet that the Republican National Convention in Tampa
[02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:20.880]  is going to be a lockdown police state. I've already talked, I've already talked to a couple
[02:40:21.520 --> 02:40:25.200]  local police officers and they say they're already training for it. So
[02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:31.920]  very interesting, good, a good job of what you guys are doing down there. And you know,
[02:40:31.920 --> 02:40:36.720]  that's the most exciting thing about the awakening. I'm saying there are so many websites
[02:40:36.720 --> 02:40:42.560]  and radio talk show hosts now that really get it and really have piercing analysis now,
[02:40:42.560 --> 02:40:47.200]  that weren't even around a year or two ago. There are so many organizations out there
[02:40:47.200 --> 02:40:53.440]  confronting corruption and making news. I mean, this has got the system really scared
[02:40:53.440 --> 02:40:58.080]  and the town halls being shut down, the politicians being routed, that's happening
[02:40:58.080 --> 02:41:02.400]  across the political spectrum, Congress with the lowest approval rating in history.
[02:41:02.400 --> 02:41:06.640]  There's no way they're going to get away with this police state without the consent of the
[02:41:06.640 --> 02:41:13.840]  govern Bob. Oh, I think you're right. And you've described the method, which is what we've been
[02:41:13.840 --> 02:41:19.600]  doing. And we just keep on doing it until we can't do it anymore or we're successful.
[02:41:20.560 --> 02:41:24.240]  Let's take another call. Julio in Illinois, you're on the air with Bob Chapman.
[02:41:25.520 --> 02:41:29.920]  Alex Jones, Happy New Year to you, Bob Chapman. Happy New Year to you as well.
[02:41:29.920 --> 02:41:37.280]  A bunch of points leading to 2011. First off, my roommate and I and his brother,
[02:41:37.280 --> 02:41:43.440]  we recently purchased and are taking the shackles off of our fiat slavery system.
[02:41:43.440 --> 02:41:50.880]  We purchased silver from Midas Resources. So we're excited about that and getting ourselves
[02:41:50.880 --> 02:41:59.280]  prepared for the inevitable. Some things looking forward to 2011. Number one is weather modification.
[02:41:59.280 --> 02:42:03.200]  You're currently seeing it all throughout the world now. I saw this and surprised you guys
[02:42:03.200 --> 02:42:09.440]  really didn't talk about this much. This is from CNS News from December 17th of 2010,
[02:42:10.080 --> 02:42:16.640]  Napolitano and Homeland Security to begin battling climate change as a homeland security issue.
[02:42:17.600 --> 02:42:22.400]  I did cover that and see Homeland Security is going to be over everything. And they are
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:28.560]  announcing no judge, no jury. They are going to be the new green police and battling climate change
[02:42:28.560 --> 02:42:34.000]  means having every post office vehicle with quote,
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.720]  pollution detectors and wireless systems stealing your wireless data,
[02:42:40.720 --> 02:42:47.680]  surveilling you, driving around snooping, claiming they got some whiff of something toxic
[02:42:47.680 --> 02:42:53.440]  from your house. Now they have supposed probable cause for the federal green police. And this is
[02:42:53.440 --> 02:42:59.360]  going to be their entree into your home, into your business, into your society. It is really
[02:42:59.360 --> 02:43:03.840]  happening and I'm glad you raised that point. Another issue is we have the Pentagon's admissions.
[02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:09.040]  We have Secretary of Defense William Cohen's admission in Army Times in the April issue of
[02:43:09.040 --> 02:43:14.320]  1997 from a press conference admitting they have weather weapons. We have literally hundreds of
[02:43:14.320 --> 02:43:20.720]  patents of how they mix it with the jet fuel so the airlines don't even know to create these
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:26.320]  aerosol programs. And we are seeing a lot of crazy weather, but it's not the global warming. It's
[02:43:26.320 --> 02:43:31.680]  always associated with these geoengineering programs. They've got massive floods in Australia,
[02:43:31.680 --> 02:43:37.840]  record cold now in the last thousand years in Europe. And clearly there's weather manipulation
[02:43:37.840 --> 02:43:43.840]  going on. Bob Chapman, your take. Well, it sure is. It's cold just about everywhere, even with the
[02:43:43.840 --> 02:43:51.760]  summertime. And of course that's accompanied by cold rain as well and flooding. And I lived in
[02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:59.760]  Europe for years and I guess probably unless you're in the mountains, you don't see any snow
[02:43:59.760 --> 02:44:06.960]  in Europe usually in central Europe. And they're getting plenty of it. Absolutely. Anything else,
[02:44:06.960 --> 02:44:14.880]  William? Yeah, I got another couple of quick points here. I'll quickly go through them. Sports, the NFL and the NBA, they're going to go on strike and here's why.
[02:44:14.880 --> 02:44:20.560]  Everyone knows the fluoride heads. Love sports. I wanted to be a sports broadcaster until I was
[02:44:20.560 --> 02:44:24.480]  awakened by you and John Perkins and Bob Chapman. Now I want to be an investigative reporter.
[02:44:25.200 --> 02:44:30.000]  I was watching just Bloomberg recently. Goldman Sachs has their heads with the NFL
[02:44:30.000 --> 02:44:33.600]  trying to get them to silence their books about how much money they're receiving.
[02:44:33.600 --> 02:44:38.960]  The NBA, David Stern, he's a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. But these two
[02:44:38.960 --> 02:44:44.160]  big entities going away, what are these fluoride heads going to do without their precious sports?
[02:44:44.160 --> 02:44:49.520]  So watch. We're looking in England too. Barcelona and Real Madrid and all those English Premier clubs,
[02:44:49.520 --> 02:44:55.200]  they're unable to pay their athletes. So again, in Europe. Well, I mean, exactly. And I appreciate your call, Julio.
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:45:03.040]  It's not so much that the public's dumb. The average schmo is an expert on football or baseball
[02:45:03.040 --> 02:45:06.800]  and all the numbers and statistics and what happened this year or that year.
[02:45:06.800 --> 02:45:10.960]  But then they won't learn about the Bill of Rights and Constitution. They won't learn about
[02:45:10.960 --> 02:45:16.240]  corporate fascism. They won't learn about how they use socialism to fund the corporate fascist
[02:45:16.240 --> 02:45:21.680]  in the first phase. They want to just stay in their little box. But as things get worse and
[02:45:21.680 --> 02:45:27.920]  worse, more and more people are getting it. I mean, it's obscene how much people invest in sports
[02:45:27.920 --> 02:45:33.680]  and get upset by it and are protesting that they're going to shut down two NFL games,
[02:45:34.400 --> 02:45:40.560]  you know, because of the snow when for nine hours, a woman was having a baby in a major store
[02:45:41.120 --> 02:45:46.160]  and in a major building and the police wouldn't come help her with New York shutdown. People
[02:45:46.160 --> 02:45:51.280]  are dying. But so what about that? Give us our stupid football, Bob Chapman.
[02:45:51.280 --> 02:45:59.040]  Well, that is what Americans have allowed themselves and Europeans and others as well
[02:46:00.000 --> 02:46:05.920]  to go to. I mean, it's a low level. They don't want to know about anything. They want to come,
[02:46:05.920 --> 02:46:12.640]  live and leave. And that's not what life is all about. There's a lot more to it than existing
[02:46:12.640 --> 02:46:19.520]  and making a living and watching sports. I like sports. I coached for 35 years. Obviously,
[02:46:19.520 --> 02:46:27.200]  I love sports. And in fact, I miss coaching as well. But I'm a little, but that's the good part
[02:46:27.200 --> 02:46:32.080]  where the youngsters are actually getting the exercise, learning to compete. That's very healthy.
[02:46:32.080 --> 02:46:39.760]  It's the worship and the betting and people only caring about the gladiatorial spectacle. I mean,
[02:46:39.760 --> 02:46:43.760]  sports is wonderful and wholesome and good. That's why all over the Western world,
[02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:50.000]  they're trying to ban and restrict competitive sports, dodgeball, tag, you name it. Because, oh,
[02:46:50.000 --> 02:46:55.040]  somebody can't be a winner. Somebody can't be a loser. It doesn't hurt kids to be a loser or a
[02:46:55.040 --> 02:47:00.160]  winner. It teaches them to compete. People need to learn that they lose sometimes. Nowadays,
[02:47:00.160 --> 02:47:05.200]  all these babies in America, when they lose once or twice, they never play again. Because
[02:47:05.840 --> 02:47:10.240]  when they were little, they were taught that they never lost. You got to learn how to lose to learn
[02:47:10.240 --> 02:47:18.640]  how to win. That's right. You're absolutely correct. And it allows younger people to learn
[02:47:18.640 --> 02:47:25.680]  how to get along with other people. I know when my son was 12, I said, look, you got to pick two
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:31.840]  sports. You're doing four or five of them. And it's just too much. And so he picked soccer and
[02:47:31.840 --> 02:47:40.960]  tennis and won an individual sport and the other team sport. And I said, you're going to be happy
[02:47:40.960 --> 02:47:46.960]  doing that. And he was. Absolutely. And then pick up golf when you get older. It's not bad.
[02:47:46.960 --> 02:47:53.200]  It's good until it's kind of like red wine, one glass a day. Every major study shows really good
[02:47:53.200 --> 02:47:57.520]  for you. A bottle a day, you're going to get liver failure, folks. You're going to have problems.
[02:47:57.520 --> 02:48:01.760]  I mean, it's, you know, a cheeseburger once a week. It's good for you. I mean, you know, you need
[02:48:01.760 --> 02:48:05.840]  some fat. Start eating cheeseburgers twice a day like I do sometimes at work. You're going to have
[02:48:05.840 --> 02:48:10.080]  a heart attack when you're 45. Bob, I want to go back to calls later. I want to hold you five minutes
[02:48:10.080 --> 02:48:13.840]  to the next hour ahead of Max Kaiser. But right now, let's get into the big news you've got to
[02:48:13.840 --> 02:48:18.960]  break for folks here on the air that's going to be in tomorrow's forecaster. Well, for those who
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:25.360]  haven't heard, and it came out this week, that there was a secret meeting in the White House
[02:48:25.360 --> 02:48:35.280]  on the 15th of December. And I got to go back six years. In six years ago, the U.S. Congress passed
[02:48:35.840 --> 02:48:50.160]  legislation which allowed corporations that work internationally to hold profit outside of the
[02:48:50.160 --> 02:48:57.920]  United States and not pay taxes on it. These companies wanted to bring money back. So they
[02:48:57.920 --> 02:49:03.600]  said they would create jobs. And if they were allowed to do that, Congress allowed them to do
[02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:14.160]  that. And they brought back $362 billion. And the deal was they create jobs, but they didn't
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:19.520]  create any jobs. And they only paid five and a quarter percent taxes instead of 35 percent.
[02:49:19.520 --> 02:49:24.080]  And that's not fair. But expanding on that, Bob, expanding on that, what is the number?
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:28.000]  I see different numbers. How many tens of trillions are in the offshore accounts?
[02:49:28.800 --> 02:49:36.000]  $1.9 trillion. And it's the same figure for American corporations in the United States.
[02:49:36.640 --> 02:49:44.800]  They have cash on hand of $1.9 trillion in addition to that. Now, these are the biggest,
[02:49:44.800 --> 02:49:52.800]  strongest internationalist corporations in the country. Now, they want the same deal again.
[02:49:52.800 --> 02:49:59.360]  They just cost six years ago the American taxpayer $108 billion. Only this time,
[02:49:59.360 --> 02:50:04.880]  they got $1.9 trillion. It'll cost the American taxpayer $650 billion.
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:10.800]  The temerity of these people is unbelievable. So to quantify that, though,
[02:50:10.800 --> 02:50:17.360]  figure out how to do it this time, because they don't think that Congress may pass it.
[02:50:17.360 --> 02:50:22.240]  And they're looking for the president to give it an executive order going around Congress
[02:50:22.240 --> 02:50:28.080]  and running it to bring it to a freation. And if we can point out to the public that they're
[02:50:28.080 --> 02:50:35.920]  trying to get away with this, we can stop it. And maybe we can pass legislation to stop them
[02:50:35.920 --> 02:50:41.920]  from keeping money offshore. Now, the reason they do it, they say, and ask for it in the first place,
[02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:50.320]  this proviso, is that other countries have much lower corporate rates.
[02:50:50.320 --> 02:50:53.760]  Yeah, stay there. We have the highest in the world. Stay there, Bob. Let's come back and
[02:50:53.760 --> 02:50:57.600]  really boil this down for folks. This is so important, so central, so key.
[02:50:57.600 --> 02:51:04.960]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:04.960 --> 02:51:09.760]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:09.760 --> 02:51:14.800]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works. For all credit card debt, medical bills, even
[02:51:14.800 --> 02:51:20.160]  collection lawsuits. When I first joined, I was being sued. So I used the program methods,
[02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:24.560]  and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:29.040]  With Zero Debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing. There is no other program
[02:51:29.040 --> 02:51:33.520]  of its kind. Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you. Let our team of experts provide the

[02:52:00.720 --> 02:52:06.720]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in
[02:52:06.720 --> 02:52:11.920]  America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you
[02:52:11.920 --> 02:52:16.160]  shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your
[02:52:16.160 --> 02:52:20.960]  own family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is,
[02:52:20.960 --> 02:52:25.600]  he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac,
[02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:30.480]  and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work
[02:52:30.480 --> 02:52:35.440]  a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing
[02:52:35.440 --> 02:52:40.160]  his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this
[02:52:40.160 --> 02:52:44.560]  enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to
[02:52:44.560 --> 02:52:48.800]  know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at
[02:53:14.560 --> 02:53:33.680]  the link below. We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers
[02:53:33.680 --> 02:53:37.680]  to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest,
[02:53:37.680 --> 02:53:42.080]  forcing taxes to service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central
[02:53:42.080 --> 02:53:45.520]  bank issuing to public currency, is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a
[02:53:45.520 --> 02:53:49.920]  standing army. Hi, Ted Anderson, I'm placing a silver dollar in a book, explains our monetary
[02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:57.360]  system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237.
[02:53:57.360 --> 02:54:12.640]  That's 800-686-2237.
[02:54:27.360 --> 02:54:37.120]  See, everything is a bait and switch. They've got Will Ferrell's new movie out, and at the end of
[02:54:37.120 --> 02:54:42.160]  the movie, there's a message, because the whole movie's about corrupt bankers, that, oh, the way
[02:54:42.160 --> 02:54:50.080]  we do this is basically wage freezing. We raise taxes on the richest 2%. What they don't tell you is
[02:54:50.080 --> 02:54:56.640]  the, quote, richest 2% are making quarter million dollars a year. That's in devalued dollars.
[02:54:56.640 --> 02:55:02.160]  So the bankers know the public's mad, so there's all these messages now about CEO pay and all this.
[02:55:02.160 --> 02:55:06.720]  You never hear about shareholders. You never hear about the owners. You'll hear about the
[02:55:06.720 --> 02:55:12.160]  managers, the Rockefellers and the Queen of England. Excuse me.
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:28.080]  Remind me, ladies and gentlemen, never to eat popcorn. During the break, they got some popcorn
[02:55:28.080 --> 02:55:33.280]  out there. I threw a big handful in, and then when I got on air, you know, you inhale a little piece
[02:55:33.280 --> 02:55:40.800]  of it into your lungs. If you think my voice is normally raspy. Oh, boy, this is some good talk
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:47.200]  radio. Let me tell you. Whoo, boy. Anyways, going back to my point with Bob Chapman here,
[02:55:49.520 --> 02:55:53.600]  that they are sickening the public, as they've always done, the ultra rich,
[02:55:53.600 --> 02:56:00.480]  always sick. The blue collar working class who are financially ignorant on average against the
[02:56:00.480 --> 02:56:05.520]  middle class, the enemy of corrupt elites throughout history. They don't like independent
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:10.080]  people that can take care of themselves and who fund the real economy that's left, the service
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:14.720]  economy and that of the, you know, hundreds of thousands and what it's millions of small businesses.
[02:56:15.520 --> 02:56:19.920]  And so there's no discussion about all this offshore money. And there's a few news articles
[02:56:19.920 --> 02:56:26.000]  about it. Instead, it's all about, oh, they're going to have tax cuts for the rich when all it was
[02:56:26.000 --> 02:56:31.520]  was keeping the tax structure that was already in place that is very high. And then you bring up
[02:56:31.520 --> 02:56:38.720]  the corporate taxes. We can pull up the news article. Google pays 2.4% internationally
[02:56:38.720 --> 02:56:45.360]  with their money. Bob Chapman continue. And so what they did with the money the last time around,
[02:56:46.000 --> 02:56:53.200]  you know, the $362 billion that they were supposed to create jobs with, which they didn't,
[02:56:54.080 --> 02:56:57.920]  they took the money and they went in and bought their stock on the stock market,
[02:56:58.960 --> 02:57:06.320]  which makes the stock market go higher, makes their shares go up. And that's very good for the
[02:57:06.320 --> 02:57:11.760]  management of the company because they get stock options. So they make billions of dollars
[02:57:12.320 --> 02:57:16.320]  and they keep the market up at the same time. This is what they're going to try to pull again.
[02:57:17.040 --> 02:57:23.120]  This is what they're up to. Now, you know, you say to yourself, how did this happen in the first
[02:57:23.120 --> 02:57:31.120]  place? It happened because they said that other countries had lower taxes on corporations.
[02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:39.120]  And that's true. But the way to solve that problem is the way we had solved it before
[02:57:39.120 --> 02:57:44.320]  by having tariffs. Well, they did away with all the tariffs. They could make all this money and
[02:57:44.320 --> 02:57:53.120]  take it offshore, sit with the tax free or get it back into the country at five and a quarter percent
[02:57:53.120 --> 02:57:59.600]  instead of 35%. You know, just another gift for the American taxpayer. This time of $650 billion.
[02:57:59.600 --> 02:58:08.240]  But part of this whole syndrome is free trade globalization, offshoring and outsourcing.
[02:58:08.240 --> 02:58:14.960]  We lost 400, 42,400 businesses and eight and a half million jobs in 10 years.
[02:58:15.600 --> 02:58:21.040]  That's what it was really all about. Because once they destroy the economy,
[02:58:21.040 --> 02:58:25.200]  they control the full spectrum. And then they can make Americans,
[02:58:25.200 --> 02:58:30.880]  they think, accept world government. Because they'll promise to turn the economy back on if
[02:58:30.880 --> 02:58:34.960]  we submit. But studying Europe and third world nations that have been through it,
[02:58:34.960 --> 02:58:58.320]  that's a con job as well. Bob, stay there. Final segment with you straight ahead and Max Kaiser.
[02:59:05.280 --> 02:59:09.280]  Take care of your health and your own family. Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions
[02:59:09.280 --> 02:59:14.720]  over the years. The crazy part is he's usually right. You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[02:59:14.720 --> 02:59:19.360]  Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest small owner, general growth properties. In fact,
[02:59:19.360 --> 02:59:24.800]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for
[02:59:24.800 --> 02:59:29.360]  free detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet. And it's a real eye opener.
[02:59:29.360 --> 02:59:33.360]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:59:33.360 --> 02:59:37.600]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:59:37.600 --> 02:59:44.800]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's End of America, the number three.com.
[02:59:44.800 --> 03:00:03.280]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com. That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[03:00:14.800 --> 03:00:17.840]  Finishing up the statement we're making there at the end of the last hour. Max Kaiser is coming
[03:00:17.840 --> 03:00:23.520]  up in the next segment with his take on 2010 and beyond. What's going to happen next year?
[03:00:24.400 --> 03:00:30.800]  It's already next year on the other side of the globe. You notice that it's all about middle-class
[03:00:30.800 --> 03:00:37.920]  tax cuts. When really that wasn't even a middle-class tax cut, it was keeping it where it was.
[03:00:39.040 --> 03:00:44.080]  They're hoping people making $30,000 a year don't understand that somebody making a quarter
[03:00:44.080 --> 03:00:49.680]  million a year is not rich and is literally who butters their bread. That's the main group still
[03:00:49.680 --> 03:00:54.560]  funding what's left of this country. And the globalists are offshore literally hoarding it all
[03:00:54.560 --> 03:01:01.680]  by design. What do we do? Just educate people about this? That's all we can do and have them
[03:01:01.680 --> 03:01:07.680]  go to Congress and say, look, we can't allow the president to have this kind of legislation go through.
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:15.120]  And why don't we rescind this largesse that these corporations have who started this free trade
[03:01:15.120 --> 03:01:21.040]  globalization and all the jobs and businesses we've lost? They're killing our country and now
[03:01:21.040 --> 03:01:26.960]  they want to be rewarded for it. We can't allow that. We've got to stop it. We need tariffs
[03:01:26.960 --> 03:01:33.600]  of 25 to 40 percent. We've got to stop this foolishness. We've got every nation in the world
[03:01:33.600 --> 03:01:39.760]  devaluing their currencies to compete against us. We can't compete outside the country without
[03:01:39.760 --> 03:01:47.920]  tariffs. We found that out in 1800 and we seem to have forgotten it. Very well said. I want to jam
[03:01:47.920 --> 03:01:53.200]  in one more call for Bob Chapman. Well, you know, and I'll go to calls after Kaiser goes because
[03:01:53.200 --> 03:01:57.200]  he's only on for two segments. I promise I'll get to everybody with a blitz of calls the last 30
[03:01:57.200 --> 03:02:01.440]  minutes and some more news that I want to cover. But Bob, in the three minutes we've got left,
[03:02:01.440 --> 03:02:06.800]  any other predictions for 2011 that you think are important? Well, I think gold and silver are
[03:02:06.800 --> 03:02:11.360]  going to go right through the roof. I mean, they've shown everybody that gold is now,
[03:02:12.720 --> 03:02:17.440]  for this point in time, the alternative to the US dollar. They've beaten them out.
[03:02:18.320 --> 03:02:23.520]  Everybody's buying gold and silver throughout the world. Unfortunately, the Americans are
[03:02:23.520 --> 03:02:32.160]  lagging far behind, but they'll catch up. And I think that we can easily achieve $2,400 in gold,
[03:02:32.160 --> 03:02:39.680]  $50 in silver. We may even get the $3,000 this coming year. And that probably would put silver
[03:02:39.680 --> 03:02:44.960]  at $50, $60, $70, and maybe even higher. What do you think about oil going on?
[03:02:44.960 --> 03:02:49.200]  The only place you can go to protect yourself. I agree with you. What do you think about oil
[03:02:49.200 --> 03:02:54.240]  exploding and one of the big shell execs talking about $5 a gallon within 12 months?
[03:02:55.600 --> 03:03:02.080]  Well, it's only about a buck and a half from where it's at now in most places.
[03:03:02.720 --> 03:03:11.600]  So what are we looking at the price of oil? Probably $100, $110 a barrel. And I think that
[03:03:11.600 --> 03:03:20.240]  from what I've observed from in over 50 years of dealing in markets, the oil market is very,
[03:03:20.240 --> 03:03:30.480]  very easy to manipulate. And they do manipulate it. They being the major producers in concert
[03:03:30.480 --> 03:03:39.360]  work with the powers behind government. And oil will be where they want it to be.
[03:03:39.360 --> 03:03:48.480]  And it's not a supply and demand factor. They want it at $125 or $97 or for that matter,
[03:03:48.480 --> 03:03:56.880]  we started back at $18, not that long ago. And so with that said, it's open season.
[03:03:56.880 --> 03:04:00.000]  Anything goes on oil. We're going to stop it. I don't know.
[03:04:03.120 --> 03:04:07.440]  Well, it's going to be a crazy year, no doubt. And I have to agree with you. If people think
[03:04:07.440 --> 03:04:14.480]  2010 was bad financially, a lot of experts are saying this is the year that they're really
[03:04:14.480 --> 03:04:19.600]  going to depeg the dollar globally as the World Reserve and China and Russia are now officially
[03:04:20.400 --> 03:04:23.040]  in trade with each other only in the Chinese currency.
[03:04:24.800 --> 03:04:33.440]  Well, that's true. And I think what the American contingent, the Bilderbergers, etc. are going to
[03:04:33.440 --> 03:04:39.680]  do is they're going to have that meeting I've talked about devalue, revalue the currencies,
[03:04:39.680 --> 03:04:46.400]  multilateral default. And I think right after that, the U.S. will say, well, we're going to back our
[03:04:46.400 --> 03:04:51.040]  currency again with gold. Wow. And that's, I think that's the route they're going to take.
[03:04:51.040 --> 03:04:54.720]  Bob, have a great new year and I'll see you next year, next Friday.

[03:06:02.080 --> 03:06:07.600]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America

[03:06:26.320 --> 03:06:32.000]  biggest small owner, general growth properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[03:06:32.000 --> 03:06:36.480]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most
[03:06:36.480 --> 03:06:41.680]  important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least

[03:08:09.920 --> 03:08:26.240]  R-E-S-B-E-Z-T. Respect authority. O-B-E-Y. Obey authority. Come on, come on.
[03:08:26.240 --> 03:08:35.200]  Respect authority. Come on, come on. Obey authority. Come on, come on.
[03:08:35.200 --> 03:08:44.240]  Authorities are here to help you do what they say and everything will be okay. Come on, come on.
[03:08:44.240 --> 03:08:58.640]  Respect authority. Come on, come on. Obey authority. Jesus has authority in your life when
[03:08:58.640 --> 03:09:09.760]  he's thought of your life. So if you listen and obey, success is yours today. You will be okay.
[03:09:10.800 --> 03:09:16.880]  You will be okay. You know, that sounds reasonable at a certain level. Do what your teacher says
[03:09:16.880 --> 03:09:22.880]  your parents say. But when you know that there's the clergy response teams that we know came into
[03:09:22.880 --> 03:09:31.520]  being about 2003. We learned about them in 2005. It was just tens of thousands of preachers recruited,
[03:09:32.320 --> 03:09:36.960]  telling their flocks, secretly by Homeland Security, they don't tell their flock this,
[03:09:36.960 --> 03:09:44.560]  submit to government Romans 13, Hitler's favorite Bible verse. But we are the people. We are the
[03:09:44.560 --> 03:09:49.120]  government. We are the Constitution and Bill of Rights. And when the politicians say we don't like
[03:09:49.120 --> 03:09:53.200]  the Constitution, we're not going to follow the Constitution, we're just going to do whatever
[03:09:53.200 --> 03:09:59.440]  we want. That's called tyranny. And so who holds them responsible? Well, according to these churches,
[03:09:59.440 --> 03:10:03.760]  doesn't matter. If somebody's wearing a suit and a tie and says they're the authority, do what they
[03:10:03.760 --> 03:10:13.280]  say. That's called tyranny. It's a very creepy song. It's called The West Coast Believers,
[03:10:13.280 --> 03:10:21.040]  Kid Band. And it's their second song. They put it together. It's about respecting and obeying your
[03:10:21.040 --> 03:10:26.880]  teachers, your parents and Jesus. Hope you like it too. And people say the Nazis also brainwashed
[03:10:26.880 --> 03:10:32.480]  this way. Obey authority seriously. These poor kids, I can guarantee that sometime when they're 20
[03:10:32.480 --> 03:10:37.360]  something, they will completely rebel against God and rethink everything their parents brainwashed
[03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:43.200]  him to do. And the best quote here, I mean, none of the commenters buy into this. It says,
[03:10:43.200 --> 03:10:49.440]  do what they say and everything will be okay. No, that's the opposite of what the founding
[03:10:49.440 --> 03:10:54.720]  fathers taught, because this isn't just your parents. It's what the school says. Well, the
[03:10:54.720 --> 03:11:00.320]  average school is saying, don't follow what your parents say. Don't do what they say. I've read
[03:11:00.320 --> 03:11:07.120]  Time magazine for kids on air where it says your parents belong to an old sad time. I actually said
[03:11:07.120 --> 03:11:12.480]  that they don't understand how cool it is to have an implantable microchip, but you do. Or kids,
[03:11:12.480 --> 03:11:17.200]  turn your parents in for environmental crimes, write them fake tickets for taking a hot bath
[03:11:17.200 --> 03:11:27.360]  New York Times. I mean, just super, super creepy. Do we have Max Kaiser? Fantastic. Max Kaiser
[03:11:27.360 --> 03:11:31.200]  joins us for the next 30 minutes or so. Then we're going to take your calls and blitz through a lot
[03:11:31.200 --> 03:11:37.600]  of news I haven't gotten to yet today, but it's good to end the year with Max Kaiser. Of course,
[03:11:37.600 --> 03:11:44.320]  the inventor of the Hollywood stock exchange system, BBC TV host, RT TV host, press TV, TV host,
[03:11:44.320 --> 03:11:52.160]  Genesis Saturday morning, radio host, very busy bee. And Max kicked off on this show a few months
[03:11:52.160 --> 03:11:59.920]  ago, the buy silver crash JP Morgan campaign. And since then, we've seen silver explode.
[03:11:59.920 --> 03:12:05.280]  We've seen gold explode back up. But there's a lot of factors add into this, but no doubt the
[03:12:05.280 --> 03:12:11.360]  Liberty movement from Australia to the United States, from South Africa to Russia, from Mexico
[03:12:11.360 --> 03:12:16.640]  to Venezuela. I'm seeing literally tens of thousands of videos on YouTube of people talking
[03:12:16.640 --> 03:12:21.440]  about the campaign. That's what you can do about the Obama deception in game for the Republic.
[03:12:23.200 --> 03:12:28.640]  The TSA just all make your own videos ranting about it and saying I won't submit. And that will
[03:12:28.640 --> 03:12:35.840]  reach tens of millions more sound off, say I don't consent verbally speak out, say no, no, no and show
[03:12:35.840 --> 03:12:42.320]  how outside the realm of political consent, these corrupt governments controlled by offshore banks
[03:12:42.320 --> 03:12:47.840]  are. I'm also talked to Kaiser about the trillions that the mega banks and corporations have offshore
[03:12:47.840 --> 03:12:53.840]  they want to bring back basically at 5% tax. The media diverted everybody talking about
[03:12:53.840 --> 03:12:58.960]  middle class tax cuts and people making quarter million year while never discussing
[03:12:59.840 --> 03:13:04.560]  the real swindles that are going on by the mega rich. But Max Kaiser great to have you
[03:13:04.560 --> 03:13:08.880]  joining us from Paris. You're only a few hours away from 2011 there.
[03:13:12.320 --> 03:13:17.680]  We're going to fade him up here in a moment where we may have lost him. Yeah, that's a
[03:13:17.680 --> 03:13:22.160]  deadline. I can tell you right now there's no audio there. Okay, we lost him over there.
[03:13:22.160 --> 03:13:28.640]  Who knows maybe in the coldest winter now they're reporting in a thousand years. Maybe the phone
[03:13:28.640 --> 03:13:39.520]  lines froze up with folks over there on their side of the pond. We will get him up and on the air
[03:13:39.520 --> 03:13:43.440]  with us right now while we're doing that. Let's go ahead and go to your phone calls.
[03:13:44.160 --> 03:13:48.880]  Who's up first here? I guess it'd be Dan. Dan, thanks for holding. You're on the air. We'll
[03:13:48.880 --> 03:13:54.240]  get to Justin, Linda and others coming up. Go ahead, Dan. Yeah, hi Alex. Prison Planet members
[03:13:54.240 --> 03:14:00.000]  suggest everybody gets to be a prison planet member as well. Just a question and then comment
[03:14:00.000 --> 03:14:05.680]  what I see personally about what's going on with my wife basically. But my question was,
[03:14:05.680 --> 03:14:10.400]  I was wondering what was going on with that social networking site that you spoke about
[03:14:11.360 --> 03:14:16.800]  to compete with Facebook and such. Such that would be an excellent idea to go against the
[03:14:16.800 --> 03:14:21.840]  New World Order. Sure, to be clear, we built one and we loved just that it had problems.
[03:14:21.840 --> 03:14:26.000]  It worked pretty good, but I don't want to just launch something that, you know, but we're working
[03:14:26.000 --> 03:14:31.600]  on it right now feverishly. I've just hired two people to work in-house on instead of
[03:14:31.600 --> 03:14:37.280]  hiring outside firms. I mean, it's obviously Facebook's had a billion dollars put into it
[03:14:37.280 --> 03:14:41.440]  or billions of dollars put into it. You know, we're spending tens of thousands here
[03:14:41.440 --> 03:14:45.840]  with what we're doing, but I want to develop that so patriots can get together. What else is on your
[03:14:45.840 --> 03:14:53.280]  mind? It's just like my wife, she works in a nursing home and what she notices is that hospice
[03:14:53.280 --> 03:14:59.360]  is starting to do the eugenics by putting people on nothing by mouth. Basically, once they see
[03:14:59.360 --> 03:15:06.240]  that they don't have a gag reflex and only give them morphine, she just has a hard time watching
[03:15:06.240 --> 03:15:10.640]  that because they suffer. I mean, they ask. No, no, no, no, I mean, I should do probably 100
[03:15:10.640 --> 03:15:14.880]  shows on this. I have done a lot of shows on the past. For decades, they've been murdering people.
[03:15:14.880 --> 03:15:18.800]  It's eugenics. Bill Gates is now out in the open. They admit there are the death panels
[03:15:19.360 --> 03:15:23.920]  and they don't give you essential surgeries and they just take you and drug you and kill you.
[03:15:23.920 --> 03:15:28.560]  Then your wife needs to speak out against it and the bioethicists are turning into pure eugenicists.
[03:15:28.560 --> 03:15:32.400]  I appreciate your call. Great points. Okay, now with us for the next 30 minutes.
[03:15:34.000 --> 03:15:39.280]  He dropped again. Wow. Max Kaiser, we're having trouble getting him on the line.
[03:15:39.280 --> 03:15:44.000]  I wonder if it's sabotage. I mean, you know the system doesn't like what he's doing and
[03:15:44.000 --> 03:15:49.680]  that crash silver program he launched here that's getting so much attention. So we'll
[03:15:49.680 --> 03:15:54.800]  see if Max ever makes it. Let's go ahead and take another call here. Let's talk to Justin
[03:15:54.800 --> 03:16:02.240]  in Illinois. Justin, welcome. Yes, sir. Hello, Alex. And thank you for speaking truth to tyranny
[03:16:02.240 --> 03:16:10.640]  as always. And happy new year to you. Happy new year to you, my friend. Yes, sir. I had a prediction
[03:16:10.640 --> 03:16:20.320]  for 2011 and that is that I'm guessing that the U.S. government will continue their program of
[03:16:21.200 --> 03:16:28.320]  aid to the government of Mexico in the form of military assistance and that is known as the
[03:16:28.960 --> 03:16:33.360]  Merida initiative. Have you heard of this? Oh, it's in the billions of dollars. In fact,
[03:16:33.360 --> 03:16:43.440]  let me just search the term. It's a whole bunch. Let me see. U.S. aid to Mexico totals.
[03:16:44.240 --> 03:16:55.440]  It's just massive. Go ahead. Yes, I believe they've appropriated 1.4 billion started in 2007
[03:16:55.440 --> 03:17:02.720]  under Bush and continued here under Obama. And I learned a lot from watching a YouTube
[03:17:02.720 --> 03:17:12.720]  documentary on the subject called Merida Initiative Collapsed by Design. And I wouldn't be surprised to
[03:17:12.720 --> 03:17:22.080]  see more intervention from the government, the U.S. government in Mexico next year. And I think
[03:17:22.080 --> 03:17:33.920]  they're probably going to use the securing the border as a pretext to further integrate
[03:17:35.040 --> 03:17:40.160]  the United States with Mexico. Well, that's what the SPP documents state is that they would use the
[03:17:40.160 --> 03:17:47.440]  flu. They would use implosions in the economy in Mexico. They would use terrorism as a way to
[03:17:47.440 --> 03:17:52.080]  merge the law enforcement, the military, and then the borders. And now that's all over the news this
[03:17:52.080 --> 03:17:56.880]  week that, indeed, oh, we just got an idea. We're merging all our computer systems. Oh,
[03:17:56.880 --> 03:18:02.880]  we just got an idea. We've got joint response deals with Canada and Mexico inside each other's
[03:18:02.880 --> 03:18:09.520]  countries to fight terrorists. And it just goes on and on and on. And that is the North American
[03:18:09.520 --> 03:18:14.400]  Union. And under that system, it is an elected representatives that control it. You'll still
[03:18:14.400 --> 03:18:20.960]  have your Congress that's basically ceremonial and rubber stamps everything. But overall, it'll
[03:18:20.960 --> 03:18:29.440]  be these unelected corporate regional boards that will control everything. And so that's a great
[03:18:29.440 --> 03:18:34.160]  point. I mean, it's the same thing. The states, the feds are supposed to only do a very few limited
[03:18:34.160 --> 03:18:40.480]  things. State of Texas says, hey, you didn't pass that through Congress. We're not going to let you
[03:18:40.480 --> 03:18:50.080]  come in here and always cut, cut, cut and put fines and fees and increased power prices on Texas
[03:18:50.080 --> 03:18:54.880]  utility users in the surrounding states that Texas predominantly powers. You're not allowed to do
[03:18:54.880 --> 03:19:00.720]  that. And you don't have a law to enforce that. And so the EPA just shows up in Texas
[03:19:01.440 --> 03:19:06.320]  yesterday and says, we're pulling all your permits, the state can't issue permits anymore.
[03:19:06.320 --> 03:19:11.120]  We're coming in and we're going to shut you down if you don't live up to what we say. Just,
[03:19:11.120 --> 03:19:15.120]  they're just doing it. And Congress is just sitting there on their hands going, well,
[03:19:15.840 --> 03:19:21.280]  we didn't pass a law, but that's okay. You just go ahead and do whatever.
[03:19:23.280 --> 03:19:29.360]  You just go ahead and do whatever you want over there. And that's an example of this lawlessness.
[03:19:30.000 --> 03:19:33.440]  And it's the same thing with the North American Union. Same thing with the World Trade Organization.
[03:19:33.440 --> 03:19:38.800]  An elected group, more power than Congress over our trade. So it's just like Texas,
[03:19:38.800 --> 03:19:42.240]  why even have a legislature? I mean, they got federal command centers,
[03:19:42.240 --> 03:19:47.360]  they tell you are locally controlled. That's a total lie. The threat fusion centers,
[03:19:47.360 --> 03:19:52.160]  they're openly federalizing everything. And it's just all completely illegal on American,
[03:19:52.160 --> 03:19:57.120]  it's tyranny. But it's got to get worse for it gets better. We'll be right back. And I think we
[03:19:57.120 --> 03:20:06.240]  do have Max Kaiser. Stay with us. Hi, this is Alex Jones. You've heard me talk about the

[03:21:04.080 --> 03:21:10.720]  of a new world order. A new world order based upon collective action. Invisible Empire is a damning
[03:21:10.720 --> 03:21:15.120]  indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents. The new world order really
[03:21:15.120 --> 03:21:20.880]  is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities. It means all the world under their control.
[03:21:20.880 --> 03:21:26.560]  The United Nations would take over America. The Tri-Lateral Commission would control the world.
[03:21:26.560 --> 03:21:31.920]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries
[03:21:31.920 --> 03:21:36.880]  to establish an oppressive world government. I believe first of all that we now need nothing
[03:21:36.880 --> 03:21:41.200]  short of a world constitution for the global financial system. Global governance with the
[03:21:41.200 --> 03:21:46.640]  establishment of the G20. So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else. And I
[03:21:46.640 --> 03:21:53.520]  got news for you. You're everyone else. Invisible Empire. Secure your copy today at infowars.com

[03:22:00.560 --> 03:22:05.280]  Gold isn't for you. Ted Anderson, president of Midas Resources. One of the world's premier gold
[03:22:05.280 --> 03:22:09.760]  and precious metal investing firms. I get it. You wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the
[03:22:09.760 --> 03:22:14.000]  government is doing a great job that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars
[03:22:14.000 --> 03:22:18.640]  like bailout candy that social security would be there for you. That's not what's happening.
[03:22:18.640 --> 03:22:23.680]  You might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the
[03:22:23.680 --> 03:22:28.800]  dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure. If all looks rosy to you then
[03:22:28.800 --> 03:22:33.440]  now is not the time to buy gold. For the realists there have never been more sobering reasons to
[03:22:33.440 --> 03:22:39.760]  diversify with gold. Since 2001 the US dollar index has tanked 30 percent while gold has risen
[03:22:39.760 --> 03:22:45.520]  300 percent. Right now savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios. You should too. Find out
[03:22:45.520 --> 03:22:52.640]  what they know. Call us and I'll send you 10 reasons why gold will do very well free. 800-686-2237.

[03:23:57.760 --> 03:24:10.320]  today. Okay we're still working on getting Max Kaiser on. I really want to hear from him at the
[03:24:10.320 --> 03:24:14.640]  end of the year here but I've got some other points and news I want to cover before this
[03:24:14.640 --> 03:24:19.200]  transmission ends but I also want to talk to you and get your take on what's the most important
[03:24:19.200 --> 03:24:26.880]  things that happened in 2010 what do you see happening in 2011. Linda in Washington you're
[03:24:26.880 --> 03:24:34.160]  on the air welcome. Well thank you Alex I have to bless you for all the good work you're doing
[03:24:34.160 --> 03:24:40.880]  and bringing together people like Webster Tarpley, Bob Chaplin, Chapman, Max Kaiser and Porter
[03:24:40.880 --> 03:24:48.240]  Stansbury all experts geniuses in their own right and it's wonderful to listen to your show happy
[03:24:48.240 --> 03:24:53.200]  new year. Well thank you so much. My greatest pleasure is being able to talk to all the great
[03:24:53.200 --> 03:24:57.920]  listeners and people out there and to be able to stand up for what's right. Doesn't mean we're
[03:24:57.920 --> 03:25:01.600]  perfect doesn't mean that any of us you know get it done a hundred percent right but at least we're
[03:25:01.600 --> 03:25:06.000]  going in the right direction our hearts in the right place and we're having a lot of success
[03:25:06.000 --> 03:25:11.200]  and if more people get involved in fighting tyranny we can defeat this. What's on your mind Linda?
[03:25:11.760 --> 03:25:16.800]  Seth and you know it took me forever to get through to you because millions of people listen
[03:25:16.800 --> 03:25:23.440]  to you Alex and millions of people try and get through on the phones and that is a good sign
[03:25:24.000 --> 03:25:30.880]  that the numbers are increasing every day and we have a chance to beat the tyranny and the fascism
[03:25:30.880 --> 03:25:39.120]  that is trying to take over our country. We do have a chance. We have a big chance because they
[03:25:39.120 --> 03:25:47.520]  are only a very small minority 13 families in charge maybe a hundred something extended from
[03:25:47.520 --> 03:25:53.920]  that and there are millions of us millions and billions of us. There are less than 20 ruling
[03:25:53.920 --> 03:26:02.720]  families. Yeah so we have this opportunity we cannot let them intimidate us with things like
[03:26:02.720 --> 03:26:08.720]  what they're doing with tasering and the TSA. Oh that's another point think of how they've
[03:26:08.720 --> 03:26:13.760]  introduced tasers and now they do it if they don't like your attitude I mean this is a cattle
[03:26:13.760 --> 03:26:19.680]  prod these are killing people and they don't care they just keep doing it every couple days I see
[03:26:19.680 --> 03:26:25.360]  where they taser autistic kids or blind kids or retarded kids because they don't answer questions
[03:26:25.360 --> 03:26:33.520]  right or they shoot retarded kids in the back I mean it's they're really trying to just set the
[03:26:33.520 --> 03:26:39.520]  precedent to do to us whatever they want and we've got to as I said it's simple just start saying no
[03:26:39.520 --> 03:26:49.120]  no no. Yes and that's why I'm calling you know one of the chief murderers who brought in what's
[03:26:49.120 --> 03:27:01.200]  going on is George W. Bush. Yes and he has killed allegedly just millions of people in Iraq and
[03:27:02.880 --> 03:27:12.080]  over because of the lies that he spoke to the American people there are over 5,800 of our
[03:27:12.080 --> 03:27:17.200]  soldiers dead in Iraq and Afghanistan and of course many innocents. Hundreds of thousands
[03:27:17.200 --> 03:27:23.840]  have been getting sick or dying from the last several wars soft kill DU. I can't stand George
[03:27:23.840 --> 03:27:33.680]  W. Bush I have been working with Vincent Biliosi and I called district attorneys in Alaska,
[03:27:34.480 --> 03:27:43.040]  California, Oregon, Vermont, Texas trying to find someone who had the balls to prosecute
[03:27:43.040 --> 03:27:50.800]  arrest and prosecute George W. Bush. Now I think we have an opportunity Alex with the change of the
[03:27:50.800 --> 03:28:00.560]  attorney generals and governors and new DA's to actually find someone who will prosecute George
[03:28:00.560 --> 03:28:06.080]  W. Bush. Well I've seen calls from prestigious organizations for criminal charges against
[03:28:06.080 --> 03:28:11.600]  Cheney and Bush. Nigeria caught Cheney making payoffs to people for Halliburton and then they
[03:28:11.600 --> 03:28:15.360]  tried to make another pay off to get him out of trouble. It's come out to that's illegal as well
[03:28:16.160 --> 03:28:22.320]  but absolutely even though George W. Bush is just a big minion if you can ever bring a George Bush
[03:28:22.320 --> 03:28:28.000]  to justice or a Dick Cheney or a Barack Obama for their treason and then Obama's just as guilty
[03:28:28.000 --> 03:28:33.840]  he's accelerated the torture the black sites the secret sites that's now all admitted these guys
[03:28:33.840 --> 03:28:38.560]  are all guilty just like they send people that are caught torturing to prison well they're the
[03:28:38.560 --> 03:28:42.320]  ones given the orders they're even more guilty Linda great hearing from you have a great new
[03:28:42.320 --> 03:28:48.320]  year coming up be safe out there tonight let's talk to Dan in New Mexico Dan you're on the year
[03:28:49.280 --> 03:28:57.760]  hello Alex and Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you and here's what I think the biggest
[03:28:57.760 --> 03:29:05.920]  story of 2010 was and what I think the biggest thing is going to be in 2011 and I think it's
[03:29:05.920 --> 03:29:15.360]  it's Rand Paul getting elected everything that I've read is he's going to really hit the ground
[03:29:15.920 --> 03:29:22.560]  running he's not going to be just a little wallflower freshman senator stay there I want to
[03:29:22.560 --> 03:29:25.840]  hear more from this because I'm glad you mentioned this is one of the points I wanted to make that's
[03:29:25.840 --> 03:29:29.760]  why it's great taking the calls because you raise all the points and more and guess where
[03:29:29.760 --> 03:29:36.320]  Rand's going to be living with his dad in his dad's condo in DC so the dad will be there with
[03:29:36.320 --> 03:29:41.120]  the advice helping him not that Rand is an incredibly smart I mean I saw Rand go from being well
[03:29:41.120 --> 03:29:47.920]  spoken and you know a little more you know just just kind of provincial to be at super hardcore
[03:29:47.920 --> 03:29:51.440]  and he's just going to get better and better and better and better and better we'll be right back
[03:29:51.440 --> 03:30:02.160]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network this is alex jones

[03:34:18.480 --> 03:34:29.280]  the solution isn't voting regardless uh we have the issue of the media doing everything they could
[03:34:29.280 --> 03:34:35.200]  saying he didn't have a college degree a bachelor's well because he was the top of his class and
[03:34:35.200 --> 03:34:42.240]  placed out my dad did the same thing uh a lot of people do he placed out he didn't have to finish

[03:34:50.080 --> 03:34:55.440]  you know doing all these things none of it was true and they failed in the past they would
[03:34:55.440 --> 03:35:00.240]  succeed with something like that people before on average would kind of the mainstream media
[03:35:00.240 --> 03:35:07.520]  doesn't like him i better vote against him it didn't work it doesn't work anymore it's a badge of
[03:35:07.520 --> 03:35:13.040]  honor when the media lies about yours truly and says stuff uh go ahead dan finish up your point
[03:35:14.400 --> 03:35:19.120]  well the other thing alex is like that i think people need to understand is that in in in the
[03:35:19.120 --> 03:35:26.160]  case of rand paul the acorn doesn't fall far from the tree and rand i believe understands that
[03:35:26.720 --> 03:35:32.080]  in terms of the debt we're in the bottom of the knife two outs and nobody's on now what i think
[03:35:32.080 --> 03:35:39.360]  is going to be the two big things in 2011 is going to be the clash of the titans between rand paul
[03:35:39.360 --> 03:35:45.200]  and bernanke and the continuing resolution um in terms of funding the government and i think
[03:35:45.200 --> 03:35:52.000]  things are going to come to a head as people begin to wake up more largely that we are in the bottom
[03:35:52.000 --> 03:35:56.960]  of the ninth with with nobody on base and this thing is really bad and then the last thing i
[03:35:56.960 --> 03:36:03.840]  like to say that um actually had a conversation about this majorly enough over christmas dinner
[03:36:03.840 --> 03:36:14.560]  around 911 and and the the conversation event evolved to the point that says that the real way
[03:36:14.560 --> 03:36:24.560]  to get to unraveling this is to begin to enlarge the scope of the conversation to include the
[03:36:24.560 --> 03:36:32.000]  following that says that you know what if george bush says they attacked us because they hate our
[03:36:32.000 --> 03:36:39.600]  freedom um and you can only conclude from that that a they won but the other side of it is the
[03:36:39.600 --> 03:36:46.560]  economics which says that the roi on the money spent on the war and terror has not brought
[03:36:46.560 --> 03:36:55.440]  it returned and to drill it down into that level of um uh that paradigm you know we're spending
[03:36:55.440 --> 03:37:00.880]  this money and what have we got well but it's more than that and i appreciate your call again
[03:37:00.880 --> 03:37:07.440]  excellent points the globalists love to hide things in plain view with the riddles the terrorist
[03:37:07.440 --> 03:37:11.840]  attacked us because they hate our freedom the terrorist is the military industrial complex
[03:37:11.840 --> 03:37:16.720]  that sits inside the banking cartel that's setting up the global eugenics government
[03:37:17.280 --> 03:37:21.120]  in that pyramidal structure and of course they attacked us because they hate our freedom it's
[03:37:21.120 --> 03:37:28.560]  true it's just who they say attacked us isn't who really did it and uh no one can deny even
[03:37:28.560 --> 03:37:34.000]  if you believe the official fable of 911 that's been completely proven to be a fairy tale who
[03:37:34.000 --> 03:37:39.440]  can deny they're using 911 to take our liberties and and and to rob us and to steal and to keep
[03:37:39.440 --> 03:37:45.520]  their crime secret no one can deny that uh let's continue here let's talk to
[03:37:47.840 --> 03:37:55.440]  mark in florida you're on the air excelsior alex i'm hoping that's uh i'm hoping that the patriots
[03:37:56.000 --> 03:38:04.960]  farewell in their 2011 uh attempts to wake up the ignorant population um uh man will
[03:38:04.960 --> 03:38:12.240]  if his man will kill his fellow man uh for food and that's evidenced by the government employees
[03:38:12.240 --> 03:38:17.760]  that attacked the michigan mother that helped children on a school bus and the police officer
[03:38:17.760 --> 03:38:24.000]  that beat up a senior an old woman because she didn't water her lawn but in the summertime
[03:38:24.000 --> 03:38:28.480]  had she watered her lawn she probably would have gotten beaten up for watering it no i mean that's
[03:38:28.480 --> 03:38:34.640]  the bottom line a tyranny is where the criminal government erects laws so they can come suck
[03:38:34.640 --> 03:38:40.720]  off of us and feed off of us they pass laws that in any common sense society would not be illegal
[03:38:42.160 --> 03:38:48.080]  well and i'm hoping the patriots will fill up their city councils because city council
[03:38:48.080 --> 03:38:52.960]  is where the blood draws begins city council is where the fluoride begins city council is where
[03:38:52.960 --> 03:38:58.560]  you get beat the death for watering your lawn begins and the patriots need to fill up the elected
[03:38:58.560 --> 03:39:05.760]  offices and and exactly you got and the state i mean you know the state needs to come together
[03:39:05.760 --> 03:39:11.040]  and i i appreciate the call if you go back to the john warren defense authorization act when
[03:39:11.040 --> 03:39:16.160]  we really knew this stuff was for real three years ago it says for insurrection by the people of
[03:39:16.160 --> 03:39:21.680]  the states and the states to replace governors to put a governor's council in which they now did
[03:39:21.680 --> 03:39:29.920]  uh this year 2010 and i mean they know it's legitimate it's real the states are the people
[03:39:29.920 --> 03:39:35.360]  they can say no and they're getting everything set up with the threat fusion centers and everything
[03:39:35.360 --> 03:39:43.440]  to take control of this country it's an illegitimate hijacking a usurpation we're being usurped uh
[03:39:43.440 --> 03:39:51.280]  let's go ahead and talk to kent in ohio kent you're on the air hi um i've got a just a couple
[03:39:51.280 --> 03:39:56.560]  of questions for you alex um i'm a planet tv member by the way i think you're sure we listen to
[03:39:56.560 --> 03:40:01.920]  my wife and i listen to it every single day um in 2010 it became apparent that the banks are
[03:40:01.920 --> 03:40:07.840]  insolvent the fdic is shot and cities and pensions are all bust and that won't be serviceable when
[03:40:07.840 --> 03:40:12.480]  the interest goes up you know i will go up crooks are trying to collapse at all so i've got two
[03:40:12.480 --> 03:40:18.640]  questions one after the currency does collapse and it probably will all right um and after the
[03:40:18.640 --> 03:40:24.560]  stores don't have a workable currency to buy food for themselves how long do you think it'll be before
[03:40:24.560 --> 03:40:28.640]  you know a new currency gets in place and things will get back to normal i'll be able to go back
[03:40:28.640 --> 03:40:35.760]  to the store again and buy some buy some food will i need six months or two years or how long do
[03:40:35.760 --> 03:40:40.080]  you think it will be before normal everybody talks about everything collapse and but how long will
[03:40:40.080 --> 03:40:45.520]  it be before things might come back to some kind of normalcy well again that's a that's a very complex
[03:40:45.520 --> 03:40:52.720]  question i appreciate that call i'm going to try to answer that uh properly it's it's not simple
[03:40:54.160 --> 03:40:58.320]  the globalists have a lot of different tracks they're working on and they have announced decades
[03:40:58.320 --> 03:41:05.600]  ago they wanted a marrow and then 2010 the imf announced they want a global bandcore or bandcore
[03:41:06.480 --> 03:41:12.800]  and and and they've it already are operating with a global digital currency the sdr that the
[03:41:12.800 --> 03:41:17.760]  global banks just issued to themselves here one a trillion here have another trillion for themselves
[03:41:19.280 --> 03:41:24.800]  while they shut down the regular economy and freeze lending at levels not seen in modern history
[03:41:26.320 --> 03:41:31.760]  and so it really won't be the currency crashes overnight and then you just can't use it it's
[03:41:31.760 --> 03:41:37.520]  just that things cost more more more more more then they have a public devaluation
[03:41:37.520 --> 03:41:44.640]  and then they bring in a global cashless currency already when you ship overseas the postal service
[03:41:44.640 --> 03:41:56.480]  is in sdr's okay uh and we're already going into that and so they just phase out cash but under the
[03:41:56.480 --> 03:42:04.320]  sdr system private banks under the sdr system companies you you can just print off money and
[03:42:04.320 --> 03:42:09.360]  there could be a thousand different flavors that has the barcode and code on it and then
[03:42:09.360 --> 03:42:15.520]  is redeemable at certain places so you'll still have regional cash corporate cash different types
[03:42:15.520 --> 03:42:21.520]  of notes or receipts that are symbols of that digital money but they're just bypassing the
[03:42:21.520 --> 03:42:27.440]  bandcore the you know they're bypassing the euro they're bypassing those were all stepping stones
[03:42:27.440 --> 03:42:33.280]  to global credits that are on your cell phone or you know in a credit card or a chip in your hand
[03:42:33.280 --> 03:42:39.200]  i mean this is the admission and so uh in a depression though there you know there could
[03:42:39.200 --> 03:42:45.040]  be some shortages some problems some things like that but i don't just see you know suddenly all
[03:42:45.040 --> 03:42:52.240]  your money is completely worthless it's it's more in a process that happens until you get like zimbabwe
[03:42:52.240 --> 03:42:59.200]  or weimar germany or argentina where people go in to have a two hour meal and they want to pay up
[03:42:59.200 --> 03:43:04.160]  front because it's going to be you know five ten points more by the time they're done eating
[03:43:04.160 --> 03:43:10.080]  i mean that does happen but before they get to that they'll just move it into something else
[03:43:10.880 --> 03:43:15.760]  and then it just robs and destroys savings and the rest of it uh and prices go up and it kills
[03:43:15.760 --> 03:43:22.320]  people that are on fixed incomes uh let's go ahead and talk to uh bill in connecticut you're on the
[03:43:22.320 --> 03:43:29.840]  air yeah hi alex uh i started listening to you back in october first off i'd like to applaud
[03:43:29.840 --> 03:43:36.320]  you for the courage of doing what you're doing um when i started researching everything and
[03:43:37.280 --> 03:43:42.400]  about what you were saying i was trying to find flaws in it and discrepancies but i couldn't find
[03:43:42.400 --> 03:43:49.280]  any and i became very freaked out and i went to uh excuse me i have the flu so i'm a little bit
[03:43:49.280 --> 03:43:57.760]  under the weather here sorry to hear that i went to uh see uh shaman who i was an apprentice of for
[03:43:57.760 --> 03:44:07.200]  several years and i drove 80 miles to see him and and basically he said that um um you have less
[03:44:07.200 --> 03:44:13.840]  to fear than these people uh it's a it's a time we're going through a time right now of where
[03:44:13.840 --> 03:44:20.080]  there's so many lightworkers coming to the planet this might sound a little crazy but he said that
[03:44:20.080 --> 03:44:26.960]  so much is being revealed and he reminded me that if you look at all the pedophiles that were recently
[03:44:26.960 --> 03:44:33.200]  exposed in the catholic church and i i was brought up catholic so i think i can say that um that um
[03:44:34.800 --> 03:44:39.520]  we're going through a time where more of more of this is happening and that these people he said
[03:44:39.520 --> 03:44:43.520]  to me you're afraid that these people are going to get away with it he said but they're not we're
[03:44:43.520 --> 03:44:50.880]  coming into a time when these people will be exposed and he said that mother earth will
[03:44:50.880 --> 03:44:57.600]  shake them off like nothing like their fleas on her back and one thing he said um don't forget
[03:44:57.600 --> 03:45:04.880]  that the underpinning of all of this uh of these elites is is demonic at its very core
[03:45:04.880 --> 03:45:11.120]  in that the light is always stronger than darkness he said he said to me when you walk into a room
[03:45:11.120 --> 03:45:18.160]  and you flip on a light the darkness can't say i don't want to you i don't want to go away well
[03:45:18.160 --> 03:45:22.800]  they don't the darkness doesn't have a choice well i tend to agree with you i mean i mean that's
[03:45:22.800 --> 03:45:28.400]  really the big truth is that is that if we refuse to stand up and tell the truth and bring light
[03:45:28.400 --> 03:45:33.760]  into the world uh they're going to win all we have to do is resist when we're in the right
[03:45:33.760 --> 03:45:38.720]  and corruption will implode and god bless you i appreciate your call there is a great awakening
[03:45:38.720 --> 03:45:44.400]  happening and the system is countering this is the big battle against good and evil i mean it's
[03:45:44.400 --> 03:45:49.600]  just that simple and there are those that are attracted to darkness and evil and they congregate
[03:45:49.600 --> 03:45:56.240]  together and there are good people that love honor and truth and and justice and we congregate together
[03:45:56.240 --> 03:46:01.600]  but but because we're free spirits we don't do it as much as the evil the evil tends to get together
[03:46:01.600 --> 03:46:08.800]  more uh and also the globalists are masters at getting good people to join evil operations
[03:46:08.800 --> 03:46:13.920]  believing it's good but they've gone too far coming out and saying torture is good and
[03:46:13.920 --> 03:46:19.440]  then torture of children is good and you know big law enforcement seminars that were in the news on
[03:46:19.440 --> 03:46:23.920]  monday you know where they're saying we will kill the muslims and we will kill their children
[03:46:23.920 --> 03:46:28.160]  and then the reporters it was in four different newspapers turned to other cops and said you
[03:46:28.160 --> 03:46:33.280]  don't agree with that dude they're like yes we do i mean they have really been given over to a
[03:46:33.280 --> 03:46:38.480]  peer pressure spirit of evil and and and they really believe there's this big muslim threat
[03:46:38.480 --> 03:46:43.440]  out there they don't understand it's been manufactured and even if it was this great
[03:46:43.440 --> 03:46:48.720]  threat you don't give up your soul to beat evil you don't become the devil to fight the devil
[03:46:49.440 --> 03:46:55.360]  and that's the uh you know really the bottom line of the entire equation but there is a great
[03:46:55.360 --> 03:46:59.440]  awakening that we're part of right now the question is how painful is it going to be going through
[03:46:59.440 --> 03:47:06.000]  this okay uh and humanity goes through these cycles uh and i just you know i'm a christian
[03:47:06.000 --> 03:47:10.400]  and and i and i believe it i've had a personal experience but i know that what we're taught
[03:47:10.400 --> 03:47:15.040]  in the modern churches is not in anywhere in the bible i actually read the bible i actually
[03:47:15.040 --> 03:47:22.640]  study it i study history and and i know that what is taught is not christianity it's it's a religion
[03:47:22.640 --> 03:47:28.960]  of laying down a religion of not facing evil uh that's the current religion that that's not christianity
[03:47:30.080 --> 03:47:38.560]  and no one who's actually read the bible would be confused um they say it's the end of the world
[03:47:38.560 --> 03:47:48.160]  i'm laying down well i mean i mean that is just a total mind game total mind control pastor in
[03:47:48.160 --> 03:47:58.640]  ohio what's your take on that uh do we have pastor in ohio it is go ahead sir well i agree with you
[03:47:58.640 --> 03:48:05.280]  100 as far as what you're saying alex and like i said before i've mounted my own little campaign
[03:48:05.280 --> 03:48:10.560]  where i'm at here in ohio trying to wake up by their ministers to the fact that they they're
[03:48:10.560 --> 03:48:16.640]  going to be held accountable for what they tell their people but the other thing you know alex
[03:48:16.640 --> 03:48:22.720]  i guess one of the best things that's happened to people this this year is the fact that you
[03:48:22.720 --> 03:48:29.200]  have opened up a lot of eyes and i do i talk to a lot of people my congregation and people outside
[03:48:29.200 --> 03:48:34.960]  of my congregation and i don't tell i tell them all that they need to listen to your program i tell
[03:48:34.960 --> 03:48:41.840]  them how to get online the whole everything and and what do you what you've done alex is you made
[03:48:41.840 --> 03:48:48.240]  it you have made people more aware as far as what's going on and i'm gonna tell you something you
[03:48:48.240 --> 03:48:52.000]  know every time i call you i have only three reason i call you because i got something i need to tell
[03:48:52.000 --> 03:48:59.280]  you do you know about these i see why tactical platforms that they're putting up and outside
[03:48:59.280 --> 03:49:06.720]  walmart parking lots and and parks yeah it's all part of police state visibility checkpoints
[03:49:06.720 --> 03:49:12.320]  these towers that raise up with microphones cameras other surveillance devices all of the
[03:49:12.320 --> 03:49:19.200]  post office vehicles are now being retrofitted to spy on everybody uh i mean it's the military
[03:49:19.200 --> 03:49:24.480]  industrial complex eating america militarizing the police and just getting everybody accustomed to
[03:49:24.480 --> 03:49:30.160]  uniforms and checkpoints and bag searches and and and they phase it in you know first they start a no
[03:49:30.160 --> 03:49:36.320]  refusal weekend we're taking blood then it's no refusal 24 7 then it's no warrants uh then it's
[03:49:36.320 --> 03:49:42.880]  checkpoints outside the walmart telescreens inside next it's being searched to go in search to go out
[03:49:42.880 --> 03:49:48.800]  i mean there it starts with showing them what's in your bag when you walk up uh you know showing
[03:49:48.800 --> 03:49:54.160]  your id when you buy gasoline because you might be a terrorist that's starting showing an id to get
[03:49:54.160 --> 03:49:58.560]  some cough medicine i mean they're just getting us used to constantly asking questions constantly
[03:49:58.560 --> 03:50:03.520]  being checked but the border stays wide open and it's very dial about a very diabolical what's
[03:50:03.520 --> 03:50:09.760]  your take on it well i agree with you 100 percent and and you know what you've been saying you know
[03:50:09.760 --> 03:50:14.000]  about the churches and stuff you know i respect the fact that you have that relationship with
[03:50:14.560 --> 03:50:20.720]  with the lord and and and all and know that that you that comes first as far as defeating anything
[03:50:20.720 --> 03:50:26.880]  but you know one of the big things that i'm telling people now is is you know what you're not going to
[03:50:26.880 --> 03:50:32.560]  wake up until you get out of the mainline denominational churches and start searching the
[03:50:32.560 --> 03:50:38.640]  scriptures for yourself because until then you are going to believe everything that you're told
[03:50:38.640 --> 03:50:43.360]  and you're not going to believe anything that's actually no i mean i mean most big mainline
[03:50:43.360 --> 03:50:48.480]  churches it all sounds good and they're real slick but you might as well just go to a satanism
[03:50:48.480 --> 03:50:54.560]  meeting i mean it's the same thing uh it's it's just it's it's pure death and you don't hear
[03:50:54.560 --> 03:50:59.760]  them saying stop abortion if your church didn't fight an abortion total new world order might as
[03:50:59.760 --> 03:51:08.240]  well go worship satan extend your life with extend oh right after my second heart attack

[03:53:59.600 --> 03:54:17.200]  the global engineers the dehumanizers are trying to fully alter the species so that we can never
[03:54:17.200 --> 03:54:23.920]  revolt again irrevocably changing us into their nightmare image those of us that go forward
[03:54:23.920 --> 03:54:30.400]  most will not go into the future if they complete this program now it is so blasphemous it is so
[03:54:30.400 --> 03:54:36.000]  wicked it is so destructive it's going to be hard for them to carry it out we need to stand against
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:44.400]  the new world order we need to say no they've built an artificial habitat a system of control to
[03:54:44.400 --> 03:54:51.120]  make us comfortable while removing true value while removing true liberty and what really
[03:54:51.120 --> 03:54:58.880]  matters while attacking and assaulting our minds our souls our our bodies our families everything
[03:54:58.880 --> 03:55:06.080]  that is what humans are truly designed to be and going into this year i think it's most important
[03:55:06.080 --> 03:55:13.760]  that folks realize we are all under attack by this ruthless guild of psychopaths their admissions
[03:55:13.760 --> 03:55:22.400]  are legion their hatred is public their sickening propaganda is cartoonish but they count on the
[03:55:22.400 --> 03:55:29.360]  average person being afraid being so scared of reality that they buy into the cartoonish lie
[03:55:31.680 --> 03:55:37.680]  the truth is right there it's evident all we have to have is courage and stand up and say no
[03:55:37.680 --> 03:55:43.360]  but as i've said many times it's only courage for people that don't know the full spectrum
[03:55:43.360 --> 03:55:47.280]  when you really have studied this situation you understand it is not courage
[03:55:47.280 --> 03:55:54.800]  it is survival instinct there's no getting out of this globalism the new world order everything
[03:55:54.800 --> 03:56:01.280]  they sell you with their corporate images and their messages it leads people to unhappiness it
[03:56:01.280 --> 03:56:09.040]  leads people to death and destruction and being unhealthy the new world order does come to kill
[03:56:09.040 --> 03:56:14.960]  steal and destroy and you don't have to believe in god devil whatever just please admit that the
[03:56:14.960 --> 03:56:22.640]  new world order is real and that they sure act wicked like a devil you know i talked to so many
[03:56:22.640 --> 03:56:27.440]  atheists and people and they're like i don't like your bohemian grove film and skull and bones i don't
[03:56:27.440 --> 03:56:32.800]  believe in that stuff well even if you don't believe in a physical devil a physical dark entity
[03:56:32.800 --> 03:56:39.200]  a force in the universe world leaders running around naked and orgies and devil worshipping
[03:56:39.200 --> 03:56:44.400]  on record and it's mainly mainline conservatives i mean that doesn't show you how phony they are
[03:56:44.400 --> 03:56:49.520]  how weird they are i mean would you would you hang out with a neighbor if they were like that maybe
[03:56:49.520 --> 03:56:54.160]  you would maybe you think that's cute destructive lifestyles like that
[03:56:54.160 --> 03:57:03.840]  the globalist revel in people's ignorance and so many people who've been in ignorance all their
[03:57:03.840 --> 03:57:09.840]  lives who grew up in front of a television set in there you know what phil diapers they hold on to
[03:57:09.840 --> 03:57:16.320]  their ignorance like it's valuable like it's a cloak of gold like it's the keys to valhalla when
[03:57:16.320 --> 03:57:23.040]  it's your ball and chain it is a fraud you will become empowered the universe will open up to you
[03:57:23.040 --> 03:57:28.160]  you will have great discernment the minute you decide you want to know the truth the minute you
[03:57:28.160 --> 03:57:33.680]  decide and admit that there's a lot going on in the world the minute you decide to get out of the
[03:57:33.680 --> 03:57:37.920]  willful ignorance and i know most of you are way past willful ignorance you know all of us are
[03:57:37.920 --> 03:57:41.920]  still willfully ignorant certain areas we've all got to work on ourselves i'm not on some high horse
[03:57:41.920 --> 03:57:48.960]  here but i do know myself and i also know the globalist i know the enemy and when you really
[03:57:48.960 --> 03:57:53.360]  look into their writings and their works and who they are and when you really study them and then
[03:57:53.360 --> 03:57:57.520]  when you can start actually seeing them with the only way to describe it is spiritual eyes
[03:57:59.200 --> 03:58:07.840]  it's not courage ladies and gentlemen to fight them okay how could you do anything other than
[03:58:07.840 --> 03:58:13.840]  resist these monsters look at your children look at innocence look at everything that's good
[03:58:13.840 --> 03:58:18.000]  and wholesome look at what our ancestors went through for us to have the little bit of liberty
[03:58:18.000 --> 03:58:23.120]  and dignity we have now that's all that matters is freedom is honor is goodness let's learn to
[03:58:23.120 --> 03:58:28.400]  recognize good from evil again and everything else will follow and do course i want to thank god for
