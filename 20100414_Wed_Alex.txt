[01:03.400 --> 01:10.280]  free humanity and we are here trying to ring the alarm sounding the alarm on a
[01:10.280 --> 01:15.440]  worldwide scale rallying the population to fully awaken and take action against
[01:15.440 --> 01:21.120]  the parasite ruling class the criminal class that has seized control of our
[01:21.120 --> 01:28.040]  planet illegitimately fraudulently criminally sadistically it is not just
[01:28.040 --> 01:35.080]  our right it is our duty to throw off the suppression now they talk to us like
[01:35.080 --> 01:40.600]  children and tell us to sit down and shut up and they deny their public
[01:40.600 --> 01:45.160]  operations they openly announced world government world banks taking over and

[14:07.640 --> 14:11.720]  preparing to go to Philadelphia and vote for independence of the Declaration
[14:11.720 --> 14:19.840]  of Independence it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope we are
[14:19.840 --> 14:24.760]  apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth and listen to the song that the
[14:24.760 --> 14:33.800]  siren till she transforms us into beast is this the part of wise men engage in

[15:09.720 --> 15:17.480]  disgusted by slugs by people that live in denial who worship at the feet of the
[15:17.480 --> 15:26.720]  goddess denial those who worship at the feet of rationalization and sophistry
[15:26.720 --> 15:34.880]  and mental gymnastics to deny clear and present tyranny on a thousand plus
[15:34.880 --> 15:42.720]  fronts growing in intensity and strength and frequency all around us
[15:42.720 --> 15:49.920]  devouring our people destroying our name turning us into chattel debt slaves as a
[15:49.920 --> 15:57.040]  paramilitary web descends and tightens around our throats like a 14 foot boa

[16:48.680 --> 16:56.200]  destruction of my treasure but I do fear for the species we are all part of a
[16:56.200 --> 17:05.560]  greater family I fear for our race I fear for our civilization I know that the
[17:05.560 --> 17:11.080]  worst of man are in control of society and are rapidly accelerating their
[17:11.080 --> 17:17.880]  program of dehumanization and wanton bloodlust and sadistic destruction on a

[17:30.280 --> 17:34.880]  our enemy and that is why I'm so disgusted with those that are willfully
[17:34.880 --> 17:40.640]  and aggressively ignorant they're not just ignorant they love their ignorance
[17:40.640 --> 17:45.960]  and they hate those of us who are not ignorant and who are animated with the

[17:53.920 --> 18:03.120]  against lesser men against the envious against the controlling against the

[25:54.880 --> 25:59.120]  able to use the money to go in and take over state governments in the United
[25:59.120 --> 26:02.560]  States national governments on a planetary scale to take over private

[26:42.680 --> 26:51.160]  sits atop our nation sucking us dry and the IMF says they're doing this getting
[26:51.160 --> 27:04.800]  ready for a global financial collapse we have New Jersey we have Illinois we
[27:04.800 --> 27:12.040]  have California we have Michigan and as many as in some numbers 20 plus states a
[27:12.040 --> 27:17.800]  lot of news says 10 states on the verge are already in bankruptcy with the
[27:17.800 --> 27:24.680]  federal government coming in with more taxpayer money and then interest is
[27:24.680 --> 27:31.800]  paid to the private banks for our right to use the supposed public money as they
[27:31.800 --> 27:39.000]  debase the currency further and gold explodes in price great story from
[27:39.000 --> 27:43.640]  economic collapse up at info wars comm 12 reasons why millions of Americans
[27:43.640 --> 27:48.880]  are incredibly angry about the state of the US economy number one they're
[27:48.880 --> 27:53.080]  simply are not enough jobs for everyone and those that are there are lower paying
[27:53.080 --> 27:57.600]  as the taxes go up number two more Americans than ever find themselves
[27:57.600 --> 28:01.200]  having to rely on the US government just to survive we're in the US Department
[28:01.200 --> 28:06.040]  of Agriculture 39.4 million Americans a new all-time record received food
[28:06.040 --> 28:11.560]  stamps in January that's the modern soup line this was up 22% from the year
[28:11.560 --> 28:15.840]  earlier in fact the number of Americans on food stamps is an all-time record for
[28:15.840 --> 28:21.520]  14 consecutive months number three foreclosures continue to set records
[28:21.520 --> 28:25.360]  across the United States and as I told you a year and a half ago the banks took
[28:25.360 --> 28:28.720]  the trillions and then shut down lending because they want to destroy the
[28:28.720 --> 28:32.440]  economy so they can consolidate it reality track the California based
[28:32.440 --> 28:36.040]  authority on property trends and valuations projects there will be 4.5
[28:36.040 --> 28:42.600]  million home foreclosures before the end of the year if you figure four people
[28:42.600 --> 28:46.920]  per household that is another 18 million people that will be forced out of their
[28:46.920 --> 28:52.400]  homes number four is unemployment and foreclosures continue to soar tent slums
[28:52.400 --> 28:57.080]  have started popping up all over the United States and states like New York
[28:57.080 --> 29:02.520]  are pushing for attacks on these people is this why our founding fathers fought
[29:02.520 --> 29:07.160]  and died so we could all live in tents slums as big fat cats on Wall Street
[29:07.160 --> 29:14.160]  roll around in their bailout cash and Neil Armstrong is criticizing Obama for
[29:14.160 --> 29:18.000]  talking about slashing the what 10 billion bucks a year or so that NASA
[29:18.000 --> 29:24.880]  gets that's nothing compared to the 1.8 trillion the Pentagon gets 1.1
[29:24.880 --> 29:32.040]  trillion on budget another 700 or even more billion on top of that and they're
[29:32.040 --> 29:38.400]  talking about getting rid of NASA basically I'm not saying it's good one
[29:38.400 --> 29:42.480]  where the other the point is you get 28 trillion of the banks the last year and
[29:42.480 --> 29:46.640]  a half NASA can't have 10 billion they've got to cut your sheriff's department
[29:46.640 --> 29:52.480]  by half because everything has to go to the bankers we're on the March the

[37:09.240 --> 37:13.200]  central banks when they take over a nation private central banks with the
[37:13.200 --> 37:17.160]  Federal Reserve Act here Bank of England in England the Communist
[37:17.160 --> 37:21.960]  manifesto 1917 when they took over why do they set up a central bank and an
[37:21.960 --> 37:25.560]  income tax because this is global government of foreign by the central
[37:25.560 --> 37:31.680]  banks this is a global banking dictatorship now openly announced
[37:31.680 --> 37:36.440]  world government global constitution signed by the banks that our countries
[37:36.440 --> 37:41.960]  will supposedly follow carbon taxes energy taxes increased income taxes
[37:41.960 --> 37:47.880]  value-added taxes increased sales taxes as they basically get rid of NASA as
[37:47.880 --> 37:52.080]  they slash the sheriff's departments and fire departments as they slash your
[37:52.080 --> 37:56.760]  precious welfare as they slash the student loans as they increase the
[37:56.760 --> 38:05.160]  interest rates everything in a Nigerian or Argentine or we've seen in other
[38:05.160 --> 38:08.920]  parts of Europe where the banks have done this over 90% of the money ends up
[38:08.920 --> 38:13.240]  going to the bankers already 100% of the income tax goes to him all the other
[38:13.240 --> 38:19.160]  federal taxes and regulations and tariffs that funds the government but
[38:19.160 --> 38:22.680]  the banks don't want the government funded and not in debt they want it in
[38:22.680 --> 38:25.800]  debt so they lobby that's why they give unfunded mandates to the health care
[38:25.800 --> 38:30.440]  bill to the states bankrupt bankrupt bankrupt bankrupt bankrupt bankrupt
[38:30.440 --> 38:34.640]  and the Ponzi scheme operators don't go to jail at the end of the Ponzi scheme
[38:34.640 --> 38:42.480]  they become dictators it's elementary and I know you know this as listeners but
[38:42.480 --> 38:47.960]  if we don't get a word out they're going to win continuing with 12 reasons why
[38:47.960 --> 38:57.880]  millions of Americans are angry about the state of the U.S. economy as
[38:57.880 --> 39:01.480]  unemployment foreclosures continue to soar tent slums have sprouted up number
[39:01.480 --> 39:05.240]  five but even with all these economic problems the price of food is going up
[39:05.240 --> 39:10.600]  and many states are passing sales taxes on food now rising demand and reduced
[39:10.600 --> 39:17.720]  supply drove supermarket prices from 16 basic foods up 16 point up 6.2% in the
[39:17.720 --> 39:21.960]  first quarter of this year due to the exploding this is number six to the
[39:21.960 --> 39:26.440]  exploding government debt the American people are going to be confronted with
[39:26.440 --> 39:30.560]  some tough choices according to federal reserve chairman member Nacky states
[39:30.560 --> 39:33.800]  will soon have to make difficult choices between higher taxes and reduced
[39:33.800 --> 39:38.480]  social spending either alternative will slow down the U.S. economy Bernanke
[39:38.480 --> 39:44.680]  recommends the private bank owner of America increase taxes and now they have
[39:44.680 --> 39:49.880]  all their puppets on the left and right parroting them number seven meanwhile
[39:49.880 --> 39:54.240]  corruption in the financial system is running rampant the CEOs of bailed out
[39:54.240 --> 39:59.240]  regional banks are actually getting big raises the guy who helped bring down AIG
[39:59.240 --> 40:02.560]  is going to get off scott free and will be able to keep millions of profits that
[40:02.560 --> 40:07.000]  he made in the process number eight but the biggest fraud is being committed by
[40:07.000 --> 40:10.800]  the boys at the top of the food chain whistleblowers come forward with smoking
[40:10.800 --> 40:14.880]  gun evidence of price manipulation by major financial institutions in the
[40:14.880 --> 40:18.640]  precious metals markets and I don't want to get that whistleblower on from
[40:18.640 --> 40:25.920]  gata guys we had that last week we need that the scope of this fraud is the
[40:25.920 --> 40:30.000]  trillions of dollars the American people can't stomach much more of this type of
[40:30.000 --> 40:34.680]  thing number nine almost all financial experts agree that the era of supercheap
[40:34.680 --> 40:38.440]  money is over and that interest rates are about to rise significantly less
[40:38.440 --> 40:44.560]  jobs bigger government more taxes devalued currency this is going to
[40:44.560 --> 40:47.720]  make things much more expensive for most Americans to borrow money to buy a
[40:47.720 --> 40:51.400]  home to buy a car to buy things with their credit cards to borrow money for
[40:51.400 --> 40:54.960]  education it's now they've got us where they want to steep in debt now they're
[40:54.960 --> 40:58.880]  cutting it off those who already have adjustable loans are going to find a
[40:58.880 --> 41:02.240]  much larger portion of their income going to pay interest needless to say
[41:02.240 --> 41:07.080]  this is going to cause us economy to experience a significant slowdown and
[41:07.080 --> 41:10.920]  then we go more into debt at the state and federal level in the bankers cheer
[41:10.920 --> 41:14.520]  number 10 one of the biggest things the American people are upset about is the
[41:14.520 --> 41:18.640]  health care reform bill that was just rammed down their throats it turns out
[41:18.640 --> 41:21.320]  the health care reform is actually going to be the biggest tax increase in
[41:21.320 --> 41:24.680]  American history not only that but because of taxes and mandates imposed on
[41:24.680 --> 41:27.760]  health insurance company by the legislation health insurance premiums
[41:27.760 --> 41:33.400]  are about to rise by at least 32 percent so where will the average American
[41:33.400 --> 41:38.000]  family get the money to pay for these increases number 11 in addition the new
[41:38.000 --> 41:42.240]  health care law that was supposed to give us all much better health care is
[41:42.240 --> 41:46.000]  actually going to force the cancellation of at least 60 doctor owned
[41:46.000 --> 41:51.160]  hospitals number 12 the reality is the Americans are increasingly becoming
[41:51.160 --> 41:55.600]  detached and disenchanted with the lack of leadership in both political parties
[41:55.600 --> 42:00.280]  approval ratings for leaders in both parties are extremely low and anger at
[42:00.280 --> 42:04.040]  politicians is an all-time high how does the establishment respond
[42:04.040 --> 42:07.920]  militarizing the police the tea party movement is just one symptom of the
[42:07.920 --> 42:12.000]  seething anger many Americans feel while many Americans are gathering
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.400]  together at large protests rallies to demonstrate against both the policies of
[42:16.400 --> 42:19.720]  the government and others are expressing their displeasure on blogs and
[42:19.720 --> 42:26.320]  websites and it goes on and what does CNN and MSNBC in the White House do they
[42:26.320 --> 42:31.640]  claim oh it's not about banks raping you or losing your jobs not about the bank
[42:31.640 --> 42:35.920]  stealing 28 plus trillion it's not about them announcing all these new taxes no
[42:35.920 --> 42:42.040]  you don't like black people just invoking race cramming race in there like
[42:42.040 --> 42:49.480]  you come up to your house and a black guy a white guy a Hispanic and Asian and a
[42:49.480 --> 42:55.360]  couple other white guys and a Jewish guy and a Chinese guy and a whole bunch of
[42:55.360 --> 42:58.840]  people are robbing your house and you walk over and you go hey I'm angry you're
[42:58.840 --> 43:04.000]  robbing my house they say shut up racist they just throw it out there just throw
[43:04.000 --> 43:10.240]  it out there to further divide to the further conquer people and I've seen
[43:10.240 --> 43:15.520]  countless blogs and YouTube videos and rappers and people coming out and talking
[43:15.520 --> 43:21.960]  about cracker and crackers mad totally buying into Obama's hype when Obama is
[43:21.960 --> 43:28.920]  what 4.9% African when Obama increased the abortion funding to get rid of more
[43:28.920 --> 43:33.280]  black people worldwide in Africa in the US when 50 plus percent of blacks are
[43:33.280 --> 43:38.200]  never born and then watch these fools sit there and buy into it but tell you
[43:38.200 --> 43:42.440]  buys into it more as the white yuppies the self-loving hating little control
[43:42.440 --> 43:47.040]  freaks that are into this religion of of of saying everyone's a racist but them
[43:47.040 --> 43:52.040]  I could care less I'm sick of it all I almost want to come out and just say I'm
[43:52.040 --> 43:56.480]  a racist even though I'm not just to say I don't care what you think about me I'm
[43:56.480 --> 44:01.480]  a racist because I don't want to kill 52% of black people I'm a racist because I
[44:01.480 --> 44:06.840]  don't want mandatory minimum sentences designed to target intercity people to
[44:06.840 --> 44:12.000]  put them in prison for one drug offense I'm a racist I'm a racist because I
[44:12.000 --> 44:16.480]  warned people not to take vaccines because that kills some black people you
[44:16.480 --> 44:21.320]  know I don't want them dying I must be racist it's just such a religious thing
[44:21.320 --> 44:24.360]  they beat us over the head with with their political correctness and their
[44:24.360 --> 44:34.040]  Soviet control oh it makes me sick I have no guilt none of your garbage works on
[44:34.040 --> 44:38.760]  me just get that absolutely through your heads
[44:38.760 --> 44:42.400]  meanwhile the Democrats are caught attacking their own offices the
[44:42.400 --> 44:46.680]  Democrats are caught even in the Associated Press now wanting to stage events
[44:46.680 --> 44:51.080]  with racist signs at the tea parties the black congressional caucus walks
[44:51.080 --> 44:55.120]  through crowds trying to start fights then lies about what people said to them
[44:55.120 --> 45:00.040]  on video caught red-handed I'm sick of it it's a political weapon and white
[45:00.040 --> 45:04.400]  people need to stop being a bunch of guilty slobs you were the majority you
[45:04.400 --> 45:08.320]  had most of the wealth back when we had a middle class and so you were taught to
[45:08.320 --> 45:12.000]  hate yourself and when the government says give up your rights give up your
[45:12.000 --> 45:16.360]  guns give up your sovereignty or you're a racist you roll over and do it you
[45:16.360 --> 45:19.880]  better stop letting that propaganda work on you and the good news is it's not
[45:19.880 --> 45:26.080]  working anymore and for black folks your black leaders almost to a man and a
[45:26.080 --> 45:29.840]  woman never talk about abortion and how most the abortion clinics are in your
[45:29.840 --> 45:34.640]  area or how the drugs are shipped into your area by the system they are a bunch
[45:34.640 --> 45:38.200]  of I've got them Rockefeller documents the Margaret Sanger documents they're
[45:38.200 --> 45:42.840]  an in-game where they said the 20s 30s and 40s we're gonna hire a bunch of fake
[45:42.840 --> 45:47.680]  liberal blacks so we can set up a system to murder these animals they call you
[45:47.680 --> 45:52.080]  animals they call you weeds they want to slaughter you and your family and you
[45:52.080 --> 45:57.880]  love them it's pathetic you make me want to throw up you make me sick in all your
[45:57.880 --> 46:03.040]  righteousness growing up having black people walk past me and go look at the
[46:03.040 --> 46:07.520]  white devil yeah well there may be some white devils out there and there's some
[46:07.520 --> 46:11.400]  black devils working with them and I'm sure not it you better find out who the
[46:11.400 --> 46:17.000]  devil is you better find out real fast I'm sick of it
[46:18.000 --> 46:22.160]  meanwhile we have another UN document not the one calling for a green world
[46:22.160 --> 46:25.760]  order or world government but another one this out of the White House leaked
[46:25.760 --> 46:30.680]  US document calls for global regime to tackle climate change global taxes a
[46:30.680 --> 46:34.120]  confidential US government document obtained by the London Guardian highlights
[46:34.120 --> 46:36.640]  the ongoing agenda to create a structure of global governance the name of
[46:36.640 --> 46:42.800]  combatting climate change now we have a new club of Rome document they're
[46:42.800 --> 46:50.200]  calling in the euro and in England for arresting people arresting people oh
[46:50.200 --> 46:53.440]  they've called for it news articles but now they're calling for it in
[46:53.440 --> 46:58.720]  government arresting you if you point out the Antarctic and Arctic ice shelves
[46:58.720 --> 47:03.800]  just got bigger record level in 30 years you will be arrested I mean is there
[47:03.800 --> 47:10.920]  any doubt about the tyrannous we're facing is there any doubt about what is
[47:10.920 --> 47:18.080]  looking us in the eyes is there any doubt about the system that we are dealing
[47:18.080 --> 47:25.040]  with here hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of documents a
[47:25.040 --> 47:30.360]  year editorials publicly written by the Financial Times of London and others
[47:30.360 --> 47:36.920]  calling for a global tyranny the head of the Gaia movement coming out last week
[47:36.920 --> 47:44.880]  it's calling for an end of freedom and a planetary tyranny the good tyranny
[47:48.920 --> 47:54.680]  and then I see propaganda like this nearly half of US households escaped
[47:54.680 --> 47:59.640]  fed income tax I see this every day in different news permutations different
[47:59.640 --> 48:04.720]  configurations AP's written several of these articles nearly half of US
[48:04.720 --> 48:11.280]  households escape fed income tax no they don't what do you think social
[48:11.280 --> 48:14.640]  security is you're never gonna get any of that money or you're gonna get a
[48:14.640 --> 48:19.480]  tiny amount of it don't you know that they just don't hire more people or
[48:19.480 --> 48:23.520]  people get paid lower wages because they've got to match your social security
[48:23.520 --> 48:29.560]  so to make it 15 bucks an hour you make 10 so to make it 16 bucks an hour you
[48:29.560 --> 48:35.960]  make 11 set of making 20 bucks an hour you make 15 instead of making $30 an
[48:35.960 --> 48:41.880]  hour you make 20 all this is passed on to you and then there's all the other
[48:41.880 --> 48:50.240]  hundreds of fines and fees and taxes and for the 47% that don't visually see
[48:50.240 --> 48:57.720]  the taxes you don't get most of those deductions and it's all written in the
[48:57.720 --> 49:03.400]  fine print let me ask somebody working at McDonald's for nine bucks an hour is
[49:03.400 --> 49:06.960]  about 20 25% of your checkout of that each time you see that down there the
[49:06.960 --> 49:10.920]  number you would have gotten versus what you're getting you're being taxed by the
[49:10.920 --> 49:14.200]  private fellow reserve yes you're paying but they're putting this propaganda
[49:14.200 --> 49:22.360]  out there about Rob thy brother and oh my gosh 47% are robbing the other 53 that
[49:22.360 --> 49:29.160]  money doesn't even go to you you don't even get any of that other taxes pay
[49:29.160 --> 49:36.680]  for your welfare it all goes to the private banks tax day is a dreaded
[49:36.680 --> 49:41.000]  deadline for millions but nearly half of us households it's simply somebody else's
[49:41.000 --> 49:49.000]  problem about 47% will pay no income taxes as of 2009 either incomes were too
[49:49.000 --> 49:53.160]  low or they qualified for enough credits deductions and exemptions to eliminate
[49:53.160 --> 49:56.640]  their liability that's according to projections by the tax policy center a
[49:56.640 --> 50:02.240]  Washington research organization let's say you get paid $20,000 a year and
[50:02.240 --> 50:08.040]  about 8,000 of that gets pulled out in taxes that's the average and then you
[50:08.040 --> 50:16.760]  get $1,000 back like a like a monkey you go out to your your mailbox and you
[50:16.760 --> 50:20.120]  never paid attention the money being taken out of your check but you go out
[50:20.120 --> 50:27.640]  there and get a check I got a check from the IRS I like it I like it you like it
[50:27.640 --> 50:36.880]  huh you like that you think that's cute think that's funny well there's a
[50:36.880 --> 50:39.880]  reason you're poor there's a reason there's no upper mobility there's a
[50:39.880 --> 50:44.680]  reason things cost so much it's the stinking offshore banks it's the banking
[50:44.680 --> 50:50.200]  dictatorship and you're gonna live just like people in Latin America or in the
[50:50.200 --> 50:54.040]  poor areas of Africa and Asia and Eastern Europe okay those countries are
[50:54.040 --> 51:01.720]  all run by private banks that's why they're poor if you suffer from poor

[54:47.200 --> 54:51.800]  around the country we're very honored to support it I'm hoping the phones up in
[54:51.800 --> 54:59.520]  the first 30 minutes of the next hour 1-800-259-9231 I want to recap the
[54:59.520 --> 55:05.640]  situation with Obama hyping nuclear terrorist attacks atomic terrorist
[55:05.640 --> 55:10.240]  attacks inside the United States and we're seeing lots of hype in the last
[55:10.240 --> 55:15.440]  year in a preparatory phase for this is it just a psychological act of terrorism
[55:15.440 --> 55:18.080]  by the globalist as we know the Homeland Security admits they've done
[55:18.080 --> 55:23.960]  illegally or are they preparing us for a real attack I I've got my ears up I've
[55:23.960 --> 55:31.880]  got my sixth sense tingling here saying danger will Robinson danger
[55:31.880 --> 55:40.600]  continuing with the tax situation the big private central bank holders that
[55:40.600 --> 55:45.000]  hold stock in the Federal Reserve are now a year and a half plus into the
[55:45.000 --> 55:48.360]  trillions they've stolen that they promised were to unlock mortgage loans
[55:48.360 --> 55:52.680]  and they've actually reduced the amount of mortgage loans since then and are not

[56:15.440 --> 56:19.480]  was Treasury Secretary working with his former boss who was the Treasury
[56:19.480 --> 56:26.400]  Secretary Paulson telling the banks do not tell the public or Congress where
[56:26.400 --> 56:30.160]  the money is going and we've all got him in testimony we've got this an Obama
[56:30.160 --> 56:34.320]  deception fall the Republic you've all seen them on the news saying we won't
[56:34.320 --> 56:36.880]  tell you where the money went and then when it comes out it's illegal for them
[56:36.880 --> 56:40.000]  to do that they say we never told anybody not to say where it went then
[56:40.000 --> 56:43.240]  Congress says the word it went where to go I'm not gonna tell you I mean it's
[56:43.240 --> 56:47.920]  just we need world government well I don't want world government shut up not

[57:04.520 --> 57:09.880]  away with this if the public wasn't just dumbed down but just doesn't know how
[57:09.880 --> 57:13.680]  things work isn't interested in wonders why you're losing your job or getting

[57:20.480 --> 57:25.640]  actually get the facts and stop it I know our listeners do but a lot of people
[57:25.640 --> 57:29.400]  out there they're helpless and that's why the globalists are doing this they
[57:29.400 --> 57:32.760]  look at us and they say these people are chumps they're just like people in the
[57:32.760 --> 57:37.800]  third world who we've got a police state over let's rob them how bad do we rob
[57:37.800 --> 57:43.920]  them we rob them something fierce we never stop we don't give them quarter we
[57:43.920 --> 58:00.240]  don't back off we go all the way we nail them and so that's the situation that we

[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:21.320]  air hi Alex I've been trying to call for a couple weeks now because I heard you
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:25.520]  mentioned to your listeners about the type of care veterans receive and as a
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:31.080]  disabled veteran who receives care in the VA hospitals and also has done work
[01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:34.960]  study in different positions in there I thought I'd give your listeners a real
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:42.280]  clear picture of what government-run healthcare looks like for 16 years since
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:47.440]  I took a 35 foot fall in the army and hurt my back I've been trying to get
[01:01:47.440 --> 01:01:52.960]  fixed done everything medically that the VA told me to do and now that there is a
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:58.000]  technology called spinal decompression that could actually help me and it
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.600]  exists in two VA hospitals and there's a law that says that they have to if one
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:09.400]  VA has it and another one doesn't they have to get the veteran to a facility
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:15.760]  that does even though all of that I am still being told no for the past three
[01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:21.400]  years been fighting this battle with the VA they are spending more money to tell
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:26.440]  me no than the entire cost of what I asked for in the first poll that's their
[01:02:26.440 --> 01:02:30.520]  prime directive is to deny the care they've got a lot of doctors from other
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:34.000]  nations who really aren't even true doctors according to the different
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.680]  experts we've interviewed and the model for government health care and
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:43.960]  comparative care is the VA we're say you have a bad knee they just give you
[01:02:43.960 --> 01:02:48.280]  cortisone shots that help for a while but then disintegrate your body after
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:54.040]  just a few years and and that's the model exactly they've had they've had me
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:03:04.480]  on Percocet and muscle relaxers for over seven years now and everything I do well
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:09.040]  you know why you know why though because it's all engineered to not have it go to
[01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:15.160]  a real doctor or a medical facility they're shifting medicine over to drugs
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:20.360]  exactly they don't they don't they don't care about making me better at all in
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:25.320]  any way shape or form I've confronted them with the their own regulations that
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.480]  they're violating and they still keep telling me no but I don't stop I keep
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:34.920]  going higher and higher and higher and higher because that is all we can do not
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:39.680]  just as Americans but as human beings that's all you can do in life if you get
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:45.000]  knocked down you've got two choices stay there on the ground or get back up and
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.760]  try again well I come in here Rick and I would just add England in its own
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:54.920]  government statistics has the lowest survivability of heart attacks cancer
[01:03:54.920 --> 01:03:59.720]  the list goes on and on because they have government health care people wait a
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:06.040]  month sometimes on a gurney this was just last week and die on the gurney
[01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:12.120]  getting no care they wait on average 18 months for key cancer surgeries this is
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:16.400]  the new America oh and I just wanted to add one more thing Alex too for all those
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:22.320]  veterans out there when the VA switched over to electronic record keeping they
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:27.800]  told the veterans that the paper work that has existed prior to that was going
[01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:32.720]  to be put into storage that is not true they shredded everybody's medical
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:37.480]  records and threw them away of course because I know because I did that as a
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:42.560]  work study during college before you woke me up I didn't understand what I was
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:46.040]  taking part in but that's what they have done they've shredded all the medical
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:51.320]  records and they're gone forever so now you pay taxes you pay taxes and you
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:56.120]  don't get NASA you don't get a sheriff's department you don't get roads all you get
[01:04:56.120 --> 01:05:02.200]  is the Federal Reserve taking everything you got they helped to create a new
[01:05:02.200 --> 01:05:06.920]  world order we are part of a new world order a new world order based upon
[01:05:06.920 --> 01:05:11.800]  collective invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalist through
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:15.880]  their own words and documents the new world order really is a tool for
[01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:19.880]  addressing a new world of possibilities it means all the world under their
[01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:24.680]  control the United Nations would take over America the tri-lateral Commission
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:29.200]  would control the world invisible Empire Chronicles how men of power and
[01:05:29.200 --> 01:05:33.120]  influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:37.120]  world government I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:40.840]  world constitution for the global financial system global governance with
[01:05:40.840 --> 01:05:45.080]  establishment of the G-20 so it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then

[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:09.080]  political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:25.480]  last week we had Catherine Austin Fedson who was the number two person at a
[01:08:25.480 --> 01:08:32.400]  major federal agency and basically ran HUD and she talked about even in the
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:38.200]  90s she met with top actuary specialist and said my conclusion is they're
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:44.680]  preparing to take the entire social safety net and basically kill people and
[01:08:44.680 --> 01:08:49.360]  then everything's going to go to debt to banks and the people she met with said
[01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:54.520]  that is our independent analysis as well so this was all decided on over a
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:09:01.800]  decade ago put into function over a decade ago and you will pay nothing but
[01:09:01.800 --> 01:09:08.440]  higher and higher taxes and the so-called healthcare you get will be drugs and old
[01:09:08.440 --> 01:09:11.680]  people will be restricted in what they can have access to even more than others
[01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:18.360]  this is the eugenicist socialist model and all the profits will swell the banks
[01:09:18.360 --> 01:09:23.280]  that own the insurance companies that's why they lobbied for it and it allows
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:28.080]  government to decide what care you're going to get and shape the future of
[01:09:28.080 --> 01:09:33.480]  medicine and that's because with genetic engineering and stem cell research and
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:40.280]  all the new types of surgery they have that are less invasive they could supply
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:48.120]  unimagined healthcare site to the blind the list goes on and on but you're not
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.800]  going to get access to that they're not going to allow a free market to develop
[01:09:52.800 --> 01:09:59.200]  that cheap effective health care for you to get instead they love the announcement
[01:09:59.200 --> 01:10:03.560]  that they're short 15,000 doctors they love the announcement there's big lines
[01:10:03.560 --> 01:10:06.560]  for health care they love the announcement that people are confused
[01:10:06.560 --> 01:10:11.200]  not getting free health care asking where it is they love the states going
[01:10:11.200 --> 01:10:16.000]  bankrupt they just they it's just so wonderful their records and I've broken
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:23.640]  down this historical parallel or analogy or case point many times but I want to
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:33.400]  do it again briefly before we go back to your calls every coastal society from
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:43.560]  aboriginal tribes on the coast of Australia to the Polynesians and the
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:54.880]  Pacific to the Vikings in northern and western Europe to the British off of
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:11:03.000]  their southern coast have called have had what are called wreckers wreckers ship
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:10.200]  wreckers in fact guys Google the definition of ship wreckers one definition
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.880]  more modern will be those the decommission and dismantle them but I
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:19.640]  want the old definition and just 200 years ago until it became a big issue in
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:25.840]  London and they went and supposedly banned it on the southern western eastern
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:33.480]  and northern coast of England there were towns whose main source of income was
[01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:39.320]  using British salvage law and they would put up fake lighthouses they would
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:45.400]  only ignite them in bad weather and when merchant ships are going through the
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:52.520]  English Channel and moving down south towards Spain or towards the
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:58.360]  Mediterranean or towards Africa they would go and put up fake lighthouses in
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:03.440]  bad weather to bring ships in to run them up on the rocks and a lot of times
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.480]  people would round and die but then they would go out ships the next day and
[01:12:06.480 --> 01:12:12.920]  they would salvage the hold and sell it and that's what globalists do first
[01:12:12.920 --> 01:12:16.920]  they get control your society get you dependent get you on welfare drive up
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:21.160]  the debt of the local government state government federal then they have your
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:24.880]  paid-off government sign treaties with the international bodies who then come
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:28.440]  in and loan you even more fiat made up money backed up by your taxpayers and
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:32.800]  then once the people become debtor slaves they then remove all the chicken
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:38.440]  feed that they use to get you dependent and basically finish the transfer
[01:12:38.440 --> 01:12:45.520]  towards total slavery so now they're just in the pure wrecking phase wrecking
[01:12:45.520 --> 01:12:50.560]  Main Street wrecking industry wrecking society hundreds of laws tax incentives
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:54.880]  to move offshore new laws new environmental regulations to shut down
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:59.160]  whatever industry is hanging on no laws in over a hundred third world countries
[01:12:59.160 --> 01:13:06.520]  as what's left of the industry fleas and then once they've got you fully under
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.240]  their control down the road well whoever's left with one-child policies
[01:13:11.240 --> 01:13:16.880]  and regulations and eugenics and poison vaccines and GMO then there may be some
[01:13:16.880 --> 01:13:20.240]  industry for you if you've been hand-picked to be part of that guilt or
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:24.480]  if you're part of the paramilitary force there will be no police to respond to
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.040]  crime there will be no police to respond to actual murder and mayhem and he
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:36.960]  legal aliens there will only be police to take your children to back up the CPS
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:43.880]  to take your farm your ranch your house your business they will purely 100% be
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:48.280]  parasitic and that's now the conversion all over the country they're laying off
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:51.400]  upwards of half the police and cities and counties in some cases even more and
[01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:59.800]  saying sorry we've got 49 cops left in this Ohio County but only three a day
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:06.360]  one per shift will be to respond to calls everyone else is to help the CPS
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.280]  everyone else is to go and arrest you for warrants if you haven't paid your
[01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:19.320]  parking tickets everything is there to squeeze and squeeze and squeeze and when
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:23.800]  they take the cops pension funds they'll say oh at least I still got a job yeah
[01:14:23.800 --> 01:14:27.240]  I don't like it the government did it but at least I got a badge and a gun or
[01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.640]  at least I'm formally a cop you're retired at least I get to go down to the
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:40.280]  bar on Saturday and you know I get a few favors if I need it we're waking up
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:45.240]  homeless on the continent our forefathers conquered there are some
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:50.320]  rays of hope the people are waking up to this the states are moving to nullify
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:54.360]  the government takeover of health care of the fights on and so Obama says well
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:58.080]  terrorists may just nuke a city that'll give me the excuse to really take over
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:03.360]  your life and pose your savior I'll just launch a new war we'll just scare
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.960]  everybody about the flu we'll just release some more anthrax we'll just
[01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:11.080]  stage some terror attacks and blaming on gun owners and veterans we'll just use
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:16.160]  Homeland Security on you that's what it was set up for good old boys we played
[01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:19.560]  you like a fiddle telling you we were taking everybody's rights to hurt some
[01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:23.400]  brown people
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:29.000]  Arizona clear strict immigration bill meanwhile the feds are trying to
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:35.080]  prosecute our Pio and the Phoenix and the county they're trying to prosecute
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:40.200]  other sheriffs that will arrest drunk driving illegals illegals with no ID
[01:15:40.200 --> 01:15:44.800]  just like they treat citizens the feds are in there trying to block this and
[01:15:44.800 --> 01:15:50.480]  got justice department investigations going on Arizona lawmakers on Tuesday
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.840]  passed one of the toughest pieces of immigration enforcement legislation in
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:56.920]  the country which would make it a violation of state law to be in the
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:16:01.840]  u.s. without proper documentation but also grant police the power to stop and
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:05.720]  verify the immigration status of anyone they suspect of being illegal and the
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.320]  feds are saying that's discriminatory yeah the police in Arizona have random
[01:16:09.320 --> 01:16:14.200]  checkpoints taking our blood and the feds Arizona was the first to do it for
[01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:19.680]  more than 11 years the feds are backing and pushing that but if you see a truck
[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:24.560]  load of people jumping on another truck at a day labor site who are obviously
[01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:32.600]  illegals total probable cause you can't go talk to them the bill would grant
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:35.760]  police the power to stop and verify immigration status of anyone they suspect
[01:16:35.760 --> 01:16:39.560]  of being illegal that's one of the few powers that the police actually have
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:43.520]  another constitution I would add a state and federal the bill see they do
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:47.920]  everything that's unconstitutional and nothing that's constitutional the bill
[01:16:47.920 --> 01:16:52.880]  could still face a veto from Arizona governor Jan Brewer a spokeswoman for
[01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:56.960]  Brewer said she had not publicly committed and commented on the bill this
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:00.800]  Brewer Republican has argued for stringent immigration laws under the
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:04.240]  measure past Tuesday by Arizona's lower house after being passed earlier in the
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:08.880]  Senate foreign nationals are required to carry proof of legal residency so
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:13.120]  what are the feds doing they're racing in the last five years with the national
[01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:17.520]  ID card the real ID act they're calling an immigration reform it just gives the
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:22.360]  illegals the ID card all of them will be given and so yeah that ends illegal
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:26.840]  immigration because none of its illegal but then citizens have to have it under
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.280]  federal control to have a job and the feds have said if you're not in good
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.320]  graces with them or haven't paid some taxes your employer will be told to fire
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:40.120]  you and you'll be refused unemployment benefits see you will neither buy nor
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:45.520]  sell without the mark and even if you don't believe in the Bible hey whatever
[01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:50.880]  the point is this is going on right now you can't deny this let's go to Charlie
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:55.960]  in New York Charlie you're on the air hi Alex first time call here first I
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:01.320]  want to say God bless you your crew and all your families thank you um this
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:05.800]  message is for Christians who believe that crisis coming back any day now and
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:10.880]  they're standing down and waiting and I just want to read something out of
[01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:16.680]  Luke 12 and it says let your girdle be fastened on your loins and your
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:21.560]  land flighted and be like men who expect their master when he will return from
[01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:26.120]  the wedding house so that when he comes and knocks they will immediately open
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.000]  the door for him blessed are those servants whom their master when he
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:34.760]  comes finds awake truly I say to you that he will gird himself and make them
[01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:39.280]  sit down and come in and serve them if he should come in the second or third
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.800]  watch and find himself blessed are those servants but know this that if the
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:49.000]  master of the house knew it what watch the thief would come he would have kept
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:53.560]  awake and not allowed his house to be plundered therefore you also be ready
[01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:58.200]  for the son of man will come in their very hour which you do not expect yeah
[01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:05.240]  the Bible in the Old Testament the New Testament from end to end is rebuking
[01:19:05.240 --> 01:19:10.280]  Israel and other nations that are wicked and sending them into captivity letting
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:15.280]  them being enslaved and it's all about standing up you know who will stand up
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:18.640]  against the wicked one if you don't the blood is on your hands I know that's
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:23.560]  basically a verse in fact Google Bible verse who will stand up against the
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:29.560]  wicked one it is your job but these government financed most of them are
[01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:32.640]  actually paid by the government that's now been declassified for four years to
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:38.000]  tell their flocks to lay down to stand down even if you're not a Christian more
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.360]  than half this nation identifies themselves as Christians but these
[01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:46.280]  people really aren't Christians and so it's important to explain to Christians
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:50.880]  that going to church and sucking your thumb and dressing up fancy and going
[01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.800]  you know to the cafeteria after church if you're not out there fighting evil and
[01:19:54.800 --> 01:19:59.240]  fighting the New World Order you might as well join Satan

[01:26:27.600 --> 01:26:33.960]  eye the wrong way and long story short I got my rear end handed to me by 10
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:40.280]  officers here and they arrested me falsely accused me of being intoxicated
[01:26:40.280 --> 01:26:46.040]  in public and I don't drink but I'm fighting a fifty dollar fine and our
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:51.560]  lawyers are telling us to just back down because you can't win so I went and
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:56.560]  got x-rays because I thought they broke my face and my my left arm and I'm
[01:26:56.560 --> 01:27:00.680]  still kind of following through I have the ticket here and and all that so I
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:05.080]  just figured I'd say to you that it's not just America it's Canada now well
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:10.000]  have you seen the University of Maryland footage of where these college kids are
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:15.840]  just walking along and it's clear video and the cops come up and beat them half
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:22.160]  to death and then charge them with assaulting the cops now the feds are
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:25.480]  coming in because the video got released showing the frame up and the cops are
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:30.200]  going to go to jail but who gets the feds in trouble for burning down Waco and
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:34.320]  killing those kids see that's the issue is they've trained the cops to do this
[01:27:34.320 --> 01:27:39.640]  and frame people but now all this video is coming out exposing them so they're
[01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:44.440]  trying to pass state and federal laws to arrest anyone that videotapes the
[01:27:44.440 --> 01:27:48.240]  police because basically anybody's got a cell phone now has a pretty good
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:54.440]  quality video camera and it's just showing people that a large percentage
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:28:00.200]  of police a large and its particular departments get even worse it tends to
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:03.640]  run through departments because the leadership are just framing people
[01:28:03.640 --> 01:28:08.040]  everywhere and then I want to explain something I've had feds try to frame me
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:13.160]  I've had cops try to frame me I've seen Luke Radowski with them trying to frame
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:18.840]  them I've seen them try to frame my camera crew at the G20 for terrorism I
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:23.480]  mean the cops are so corrupt in New York they walk up with video cameras rolling
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:27.760]  and say we are going to frame you as terrorists that's in truth rising on
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:33.560]  video they knew they had cameras and didn't even care I mean think of the
[01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:38.840]  magnitude of evil that those cops have been told you can even frame people on
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:44.040]  video I mean folks there's a Supreme Court case coming up and it looks like
[01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:46.920]  it's going to go well we're talking to folks involved that I'm going to play
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:52.320]  some audio and video of this coming up that we might just go live at prison
[01:28:52.320 --> 01:28:56.560]  planet dot TV in the last segment of this hour so people can actually see
[01:28:56.560 --> 01:29:01.640]  this but the article is epic corruption and the whistleblower but before I get
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:05.040]  into that just finishing up so they came over told you you were drunk and
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:10.520]  that's why they beat you up no they caught the officer was driving by and
[01:29:10.520 --> 01:29:15.160]  caught my eye and gave me the kind of look that I'm sure you're you're used
[01:29:15.160 --> 01:29:22.160]  to that arrogant pompous look and I kind of just as a gut reaction gave it back
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:27.000]  to him and he just stopped the cruiser god minute you mean a slave kind of let
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.360]  his eyes glare back at a god this is the Soviet Union pal you don't you don't
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:36.800]  look at a god like that so so but they showed you their god right call on the
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:41.520]  Nazis I said you guys are the coke and heroin dealers here probably doing
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:45.600]  child molestation and they really didn't like that and there I was they're
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:49.840]  beating me on the ground I took pictures and I sent I sent the pictures to you
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:53.880]  but I don't know who to send them to we're on the march the empires on the

[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:27.520]  planet.tv in the next segment all the same I'm gonna get into basically the
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:34.480]  full spectrum of issues with Gerald Solente in the third and fourth hour
[01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:42.200]  today top trends forecaster there are now scores of nations that have joined
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:48.040]  I'm hearing about it all over talk radio even some mainline talk radio another
[01:33:48.040 --> 01:33:55.280]  example of what one person can do with an idea Karen Quinn Dostado taxfree15.com
[01:33:55.280 --> 01:34:02.320]  is the website and we had her on about a month ago talking about tax day and
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:08.840]  basically a national strike but also a time to educate ourselves about the
[01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:14.080]  nature of the private Federal Reserve and the fact that our taxes all go via
[01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:19.920]  the income tax that tax all goes to private central banks the taxes go up
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:24.440]  your so-called services go down they were just getting you in debt before
[01:34:24.440 --> 01:34:30.800]  with the chicken feed now the services go bye-bye are are used to basically
[01:34:30.800 --> 01:34:38.640]  euthanize you Karen it's good to have you on with us you bet for those that
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:42.080]  just joined us or may not know about the movement recap it for us and talk
[01:34:42.080 --> 01:34:46.400]  about the success and what's coming up tomorrow in the next few days well thank
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:50.840]  you you know since the last time we spoke incredible things have really
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:56.360]  started to happen with help of dedicated Americans like yourself and activists
[01:34:56.360 --> 01:35:03.360]  all across this great country and the world tax free 15.com and our sister
[01:35:03.360 --> 01:35:11.120]  site in the UK at tax free 15.org.uk we have generated a ground swell of global
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:17.720]  support from 89 nations the websites now in the top half million most visited
[01:35:17.720 --> 01:35:22.200]  globally which is awesome we have volunteers that have produced videos
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:27.360]  on YouTube people are promoting the strike the grassroots call-ins have been
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:32.240]  98% supportive and the list of alternative radio host on board is
[01:35:32.240 --> 01:35:37.880]  growing and it's a message though Alex it's a message that has resonated within
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:42.120]  the hearts of the minds of the people because the plan is simple and all of
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:46.960]  us can participate in one form or another and this is not just an American
[01:35:46.960 --> 01:35:54.760]  problem this is a global problem so the plan is April 15th through April 18th
[01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:59.520]  now we need to get the attention of the corporations who really believe that they
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:05.600]  own us and let them know that they don't so number one no work no school our
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:10.400]  future depends on restoring our rights so focusing to plan ahead ask for time
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.040]  off use vacation days or whatever it takes to get school assignments for your
[01:36:14.040 --> 01:36:18.320]  children there will be education about the Constitution and the articles of
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:25.720]  freedom offered at articles of freedom dot us second step if you can't if you
[01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:29.920]  don't think that you can stay home if that's too big a step right now brown
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:34.240]  bag your lunch because the second step and the third and the fourth are steps
[01:36:34.240 --> 01:36:39.880]  that you can participate in so number two no shopping don't buy a single
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:44.800]  solitary thing from large corporations that means fast food places like
[01:36:44.800 --> 01:36:50.000]  McDonald's corporate online stores again plan ahead for your medications your
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.000]  gas and your food if you have to shop go to a mom and pop if you go online go to
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:37:00.880]  a mom and pop online store this is against the corporations who are robbing
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.680]  us blind folks not against our neighbors they are the people we need to
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:11.240]  support the third step is don't comply put your savings and locally owned
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:15.760]  banks or hard assets if you do take hard assets make sure you get them in your
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:20.480]  possession or leave only what you need to cover your monthly bills work at
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:25.200]  getting off the grid and forming co-ops within communities corporations are the
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:30.160]  target folks not not each other we have to learn to read my corporations you
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:36.400]  mean you mean the fortune 100 500 the globalist that's exactly who I mean so
[01:37:36.400 --> 01:37:43.880]  and then the last step is ask why you know why are we here are we part of the
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:48.400]  problem or are we part of the solution because there is no other choice right
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:53.200]  now folks we fit in one of those categories why are we allowing our
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:57.760]  Constitution to be trampled yeah this is a time to be reflective to educate
[01:37:57.760 --> 01:38:03.640]  others and to repent and realize just how dire straights were in to kind of
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:09.160]  slow down and and and regage what's happening that's exactly right Alex and
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:13.440]  then we pick up the telephone and we call our misrepresentative and ask them
[01:38:13.440 --> 01:38:17.800]  the same questions and we tell them that we're participating in the strike we
[01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:22.640]  are watching them they will be accountable to the Constitution and the
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:27.560]  Articles of Freedom which will be served on the 19th because the 19th folks is
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:33.640]  Patriots Day and a patriot is not just someone in America a patriot is a person
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:39.000]  who loves support and defend his or her country and its interests with devotion
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:44.480]  and also they defend their individual rights against presumed interference by
[01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:51.280]  the federal government but it certainly is no longer presumed I expected you to
[01:38:51.280 --> 01:38:56.640]  jump in there Alex you've got all kinds of reasons it isn't presumed no I'm you
[01:38:56.640 --> 01:38:59.800]  know what I've learned to just keep my mouth shut or I will start interrupting
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:02.720]  because that's when I interrupt I have all these ideas while you're talking so
[01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:07.480]  I'm learning and and seasoning myself to learn to keep my mouth shut
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:12.280]  sometimes but the bigger issue here is you've only been doing this a few months
[01:39:12.280 --> 01:39:16.520]  you've got 80 plus countries involved there's a big buzz going and as long as
[01:39:16.520 --> 01:39:20.880]  every 15th we continue to use it as a time to call Congress a time to
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:24.760]  educate others a time to go speak at our city councils a time to educate our
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:28.800]  children about our bill of rights our Constitution the alternative to this
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:35.080]  globalist corporate tyranny this is again not a silver bullet it's one more
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:40.480]  tool look at how I've promoted and helped launch we are changed when it was
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:45.440]  just Luke Radowski now 300 and something chap chapters globally alternative
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:50.840]  media exposing the global warming hoax the false flag terror hoax the banking
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:56.240]  hoax confronting Al Gore David Rockefeller New World Order minions every
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:02.720]  day every major city in the world now being confronted daily by we are changed
[01:40:02.720 --> 01:40:07.440]  people then uploading the video that tens of millions of scene other people
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:11.720]  are now mimicking the guerrilla journalism of going into events and
[01:40:11.720 --> 01:40:17.320]  injecting real issues culture jamming the New World Order short circuiting their
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:21.880]  propaganda placement their brainwashing placement their behavior placement as
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:28.360]  they call it the act of resistance is victory peaceably in the info war and
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:33.200]  that's why what you're doing is so exciting so again it also bring other
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:38.560]  people in to the tax free 15.com movement and if you've got ideas start
[01:40:38.560 --> 01:40:44.040]  your own movement or your own operation because they can't shut us all down and
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:50.040]  our message is now cutting through that electronic Berlin wall more and more and
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:55.800]  so the battles joined we're not winning but we're not losing we're in the fight
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:00.800]  and it's up to all of you how this contest is going to end that's exactly
[01:41:00.800 --> 01:41:05.520]  right and one of the best things though about this Alex is we're not telling
[01:41:05.520 --> 01:41:09.920]  people how to think or who to believe we're telling them to take some time out
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:14.760]  so they can really do some research and find out for themselves if the belief
[01:41:14.760 --> 01:41:19.160]  systems they have are actually one that they have explored that they have
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:23.320]  research or if they've just been propagandized to the point where they
[01:41:23.320 --> 01:41:27.720]  really don't know why they believe it and we need to have courage in this
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:32.360]  country we need to know that somebody who's seeking the truth is a person who
[01:41:32.360 --> 01:41:37.040]  has courage and honor and integrity and if there is a third party in this
[01:41:37.040 --> 01:41:41.000]  country it should be the truth or party there are enough of us out there
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:44.680]  there are over a hundred million of us who want to know the truth who want to
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:49.600]  know why we spend over a billion dollars a week on war why we allow our
[01:41:49.600 --> 01:41:55.640]  soldiers to use depleted uranium why we are murdering and torturing and why
[01:41:55.640 --> 01:42:02.080]  globally our economy is based on war this is the 21st century folks it is
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:06.520]  time to stop that it is time to recognize we don't have to give our power
[01:42:06.520 --> 01:42:10.840]  away to other people we don't have to abandon our homes and our lives and our
[01:42:10.840 --> 01:42:16.600]  families to cook and clean and fight and die for other people we have God given
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:22.440]  rights this is the time to rise our flesh has forgotten what our spirits
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:27.680]  remember we have God given rights we are sovereign individuals we the people
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:33.040]  must save our country's government have sold us out we the people it is time to
[01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:38.720]  awaken and rise absolutely and continue to awaken others that is one of the
[01:42:38.720 --> 01:42:43.840]  most important keys to this scenario so again people can go to taxfree15.com
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:49.520]  and learn more and I mean I knew this was gonna be successful because of your
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:55.960]  passion and because the message was very clear-cut and strong and reality-based
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:43:01.000]  and so now I'm just excited to see so many people joining Karen Quinn
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:08.080]  to start in what she is doing and so how does this kick off tomorrow I mean I
[01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:12.920]  well that's one quick question and then secondarily it's also very important for
[01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:18.320]  all of our listeners out there an activist to call your local radio and
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:23.520]  TV station they're the easiest to get on and to direct them to this grassroots
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:27.280]  movement because the establishment is trying to co-opt all the grassroots
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:35.200]  movements during the break Rob Dew was in here showing me a Yahoo story in a
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:42.520]  video sponsored by Toyota claiming that some Republican back group started the
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:49.440]  Tea Party in 2009 and branding it as an establishment system in the name of
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:55.520]  giving it support when the Tea Parties were started in 2005 by the 9-11 Truth
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:00.840]  and then in their current you know real incarnation the Proto Tea Party by Ron
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:05.480]  Paul supporter 2007 that's the true history and so that's why we have to
[01:44:05.480 --> 01:44:09.800]  continually launch new organizations new operations because then the globalist
[01:44:09.800 --> 01:44:15.160]  can't infiltrate and take us down because ideas are bulletproof when
[01:44:15.160 --> 01:44:21.120]  they're the truth that is what's so important well this Alex fits into every
[01:44:21.120 --> 01:44:25.200]  plan that's really out there because in order to start it people just have to
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:30.080]  wake up in the morning and know they are free they are sovereign they can do what
[01:44:30.080 --> 01:44:34.680]  they choose to do during the day they can stay and they can live well living
[01:44:34.680 --> 01:44:39.120]  well is the best revenge not paying attention to the government trying to
[01:44:39.120 --> 01:44:43.800]  tell you everything to do turning off your television set some people want to
[01:44:43.800 --> 01:44:48.880]  go out and join some of these Tea Party rallies we're encouraging them to bring
[01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:53.160]  their lunch to bring a video camera other people who are afraid to show up in
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:56.520]  public because they've been listening to the provocateurs because they know
[01:44:56.520 --> 01:45:01.040]  there's danger out there can know that they are participating from the safety
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:06.200]  of their own home just by not spending a dime at a corporate place by calling up
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:10.560]  their misrepresentative by educating themselves by starting to think about
[01:45:10.560 --> 01:45:15.520]  who they are and where they want to be how are you gonna get your food folks
[01:45:15.520 --> 01:45:19.320]  what are you gonna do to protect your families where do you want to live these
[01:45:19.320 --> 01:45:23.280]  are big questions that we need to be prepared to answer we need to build
[01:45:23.280 --> 01:45:28.320]  communities we need to understand that the reason things have value is because
[01:45:28.320 --> 01:45:35.040]  we give them value some of us who are out of work now are good at plumbing or
[01:45:35.040 --> 01:45:41.120]  building houses or we have computer skills others of us are farmers we need
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:45.040]  to connect in Europe and that's what the corporate is do they build a big
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:48.960]  government they get you dependent they get you in compact cities then they cut
[01:45:48.960 --> 01:45:52.800]  off the resources and then they tell you through environmentalism that you're a
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:58.640]  cancer you're a scourge humans are bad this is the elite waging war on their
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:04.000]  fellow man they see us as a scourge eating their resources when the truth is
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:09.320]  the elites have tried to dumb the public down because they're challenged by free
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:15.320]  humanity they are despicable jealous envious control freaks that must be
[01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:21.200]  identified and must be defeated Karen Quinn Tostada I want to thank you for
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:28.120]  joining us tax-free 15.com is a portal to all things tax-free 15 and we'll talk
[01:46:28.120 --> 01:46:32.720]  to you some more coming up next week in the aftermath for a quick pop-in to see
[01:46:32.720 --> 01:46:37.520]  how this went Karen thank you and I salute you thank you Alex God bless
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:43.160]  speaking of provocateurs I told you how Turner was a Fed and I told you that
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:47.360]  there were feds infiltrating the Atari militia last August and they didn't set
[01:46:47.360 --> 01:46:53.280]  them up I tried to warn Atari but what do I know I told you they're trying to
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.080]  infiltrate oath keepers to claim their violent oath keepers has put out a press
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:47:01.640]  release it's up on prisonplanet.com saying they had to cancel being part of
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:05.680]  the Second Amendment Tea Party March in DC because provocateurs are going to show
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:10.120]  up and claim they were oath keepers I'm not even saying that's good or bad they
[01:47:10.120 --> 01:47:13.880]  made their decision to do that but we caught the anarchist a month ago and
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:17.480]  then again two weeks ago and then again last week on all their big foundation
[01:47:17.480 --> 01:47:21.160]  funded government funded websites saying they were going to infiltrate the Tea
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:27.040]  Parties and hold up inward signs and act like kooks with the media and that now
[01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:33.040]  hit the AP yesterday this is real that's how criminal this government is
[01:47:33.040 --> 01:47:37.400]  they're on the news saying it's a bunch of white supremacists at these meetings
[01:47:37.400 --> 01:47:41.760]  and so they will send their white supremacists I say go ahead and have
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:46.480]  your meetings in fact more people need to show up and just identify these
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:51.240]  individuals for who they are that's how the web works you videotape them you put
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:55.280]  out your suspicions you follow them to their car you keep your distance you
[01:47:55.280 --> 01:47:59.400]  get their license plate you run their plates you find out they're a cop or
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:04.600]  Southern Poverty Law Center or an ADL and we keep hurting them bad look you
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:09.440]  don't defeat the enemy without finding the enemy and I agree we've got to you
[01:48:09.440 --> 01:48:14.240]  know choose our battles but we're kicking their hind in that's why they're
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:18.760]  panicking that's why they're scared that's why they've got articles every
[01:48:18.760 --> 01:48:22.400]  day there was a new article today saying I'm calling for violence when I'm
[01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:27.360]  calling for the opposite because they are playing to the dumb down public who's
[01:48:27.360 --> 01:48:31.720]  only halfway listening they're just trying to put out the line long enough to
[01:48:31.720 --> 01:48:36.640]  people believe it you know these two parties are chanting the n-word and
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:41.320]  they're not so now since that's been exposed they're gonna dispatch their
[01:48:41.320 --> 01:48:45.160]  people I mean folks they did this to me one time I was having a land rights
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:50.440]  rally that was 1997 we may have 200 people at the Capitol and some clan
[01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:56.200]  guys show up and I saw him in the parking lot across the street in the state
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:00.240]  police parking lot where I've seen him stage things before talking to cops and
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:04.480]  then I later saw him leave and cops drive out behind them they were cops
[01:49:04.480 --> 01:49:14.280]  there in clown I had a Freudian slip clown outfits clan wizard outfits and I
[01:49:14.280 --> 01:49:17.520]  walked over and said I know your cops and I'm gonna expose you if you're part of
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:23.240]  this rally so they left I mean I've been dealing with this forever this is not my
[01:49:23.240 --> 01:49:27.880]  first rodeo ladies and gentlemen I've been in rodeo after rodeo after rodeo
[01:49:27.880 --> 01:49:33.240]  and I have to be as dumb as a box of rocks to not know how this works and
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:43.240]  how these people operate and I'm trying to dig up the video there's a short clip
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:46.000]  of it online but there's got to be an hour of it I know we're going to access
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:51.160]  TV I know Mike Hansen's got it he's got to dig through those thousands of videos
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:59.400]  of one big clan rally in Waco and the clan had been out there at the site we
[01:49:59.400 --> 01:50:03.640]  were building a memorial church for those that died starting fights and doing
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:06.360]  stuff and then they were having a rally and I went and looked at them I could
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:10.120]  tell they were all cops leadership it was only about nine or ten of them I
[01:50:10.120 --> 01:50:13.000]  mean they were all cops I can look at them I can assess them they were they
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  were cops and informants and I was screaming big fat federal agent the
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:21.440]  whole time and I had cops come over try to start fights with me there's footage
[01:50:21.440 --> 01:50:26.200]  of this we should have had the money and time back then to chronicle all this and
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:31.520]  save it so important now and they had a parking garage across the street from the
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:36.520]  county courthouse there in Waco and they had two cops of sniper sniper rifles
[01:50:36.520 --> 01:50:39.800]  and guess who they were tracking the whole time I was wearing a t-shirt and
[01:50:39.800 --> 01:50:46.240]  jeans clearly had no weapon they had their crosshairs on me because I was
[01:50:46.240 --> 01:50:51.880]  there exposing their boys by the way it was a pro Waco survivor clan rally to
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:56.720]  demonize the Waco survivors who wanted a part of it and the cops got mad that I
[01:50:56.720 --> 01:51:00.600]  was there screaming big fat federal agent at their man

[01:55:01.000 --> 01:55:06.200]  because the political circumstance that has created this situation is that you

[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:18.720]  the person that went in and called them on it you have the county supervisors
[01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:25.320]  taking public tax money and paying off the judges and in return what happens is
[01:55:25.320 --> 01:55:30.240]  that the judges decide the cases in favor of the county the next thing that
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:35.600]  you have is you have the state legislature going in and giving the
[01:55:35.600 --> 01:55:40.920]  judges and the county supervisors immunity for their actions at the same
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:48.680]  point in time you have the judges going to the state bar to get me disbarred for
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:54.320]  the case that I brought to say that the people have been denied due process so
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:56:00.600]  this is a pure political thing this is actually the biggest judicial scandal
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:05.320]  and judicial bribery scheme in American history he warns us from his personal
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:11.720]  experience that this could happen to you my being in jail for one year and
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:20.200]  possibly longer should show you that nobody is immune from this abuse of
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:24.680]  power our forefathers warned us about this peril in the Declaration of
[01:56:24.680 --> 01:56:29.840]  Independence if you go back into a very interesting thing and read the end part
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:34.440]  of the Declaration of Independence they talk about the judges being brought out
[01:56:34.440 --> 01:56:39.720]  by the king and America in the beginning didn't have any judicial system
[01:56:39.720 --> 01:56:43.200]  because it was all being run by the king and that's one of the reasons why we
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:48.360]  rebelled his situation is a foreshadowing that America is sliding into the
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:53.960]  despotism of a banana republic what is happening here in the United States right
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:57:00.240]  now with my sitting in this jail in this orange outfit means that the government
[01:57:00.240 --> 01:57:05.160]  that is taking place here with the loss of our judiciary and that's what it is
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:09.560]  this is the same thing that is happening in Iran but they're throwing people in
[01:57:09.560 --> 01:57:13.960]  jail for protesting about an election it's the same thing that is happening in
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:18.640]  minamar okay we're going to come back in the next segment the next five minutes
[01:57:18.640 --> 01:57:22.200]  and then Gerald Salenty joins us and play the rest of this in comment but in
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:27.040]  this case judicial watch had to follow a lawsuit months after he was in jail the
[01:57:27.040 --> 01:57:34.040]  sheriff won't say why he's in jail there's no record they just say that he is
[01:57:34.040 --> 01:57:39.120]  now to stay in jail basically potentially forever and the Supreme Court's
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:43.640]  having an emergency hearing on it this week there's a protest on April 20th
[01:57:43.640 --> 01:57:48.480]  about it he never got charged never had a trial there's been no conviction or
[01:57:48.480 --> 01:57:52.320]  any sentence to keep him there sheriff Leroy Baca claims he does not know why
[01:57:52.320 --> 01:57:57.280]  fine is in jail yet he keeps him there and has failed to answer fines rid of
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:58:02.360]  habeas corpus Baca refused to allow a film interview with fine until judicial
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:06.400]  watch followed a lawsuit on behalf of full disclosure network we're gonna get
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:11.360]  them on next week and then out of the blue he changed his mind and granted a
[01:58:11.360 --> 01:58:17.640]  filmed interview with them and we're gonna go over more of this coming up but

[02:00:20.280 --> 02:00:26.640]  Alex Jones charity is here I can't tell you how many mainstream news articles
[02:00:26.640 --> 02:00:32.200]  I've read for big cities small towns you name it small towns tend to be the
[02:00:32.200 --> 02:00:36.600]  worst per capita the cops just pull people over steal their cars steal their
[02:00:36.600 --> 02:00:42.000]  money plant drugs on them you'll have the mayor's brother owning a local private
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:48.920]  prison in some cases they'll have half of the town in the jail in the case of
[02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:52.040]  Tulia Texas more than half the black people in the town were in the jail
[02:00:52.040 --> 02:00:57.000]  they planted drugs on them that all came out later and then you get this case
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:02.600]  now going to the Supreme Court epic corruption in the whistleblower buying
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:07.680]  exposed LA Superior Court judges for taking illegal money from the county in
[02:01:07.680 --> 02:01:11.760]  violation of the California State Constitution to rule the county's
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:15.440]  supervisors are using public tax money to pay off the Superior Court judges
[02:01:15.440 --> 02:01:20.360]  number three the Superior Court judges decided cases in favor of the county and
[02:01:20.360 --> 02:01:25.320]  it just goes on and on and this guy is in jail and they won't even tell the
[02:01:25.320 --> 02:01:28.720]  Supreme Court while they're there they just say look he's in jail that's the
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:33.040]  end of it this is the essence of tyranny but remember I just use a case that was
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:37.520]  did get some national attention Pennsylvania rocked by jailing kids for
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:44.200]  cash scandal this is how it works I mean it most of the family court judges if
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:47.040]  you investigate them you find out they're living in million dollar houses
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:50.360]  and they're getting money from the different adoption agencies I mean they
[02:01:50.360 --> 02:01:55.280]  hunt your family this is slavery slavery is legal in America tortures legal
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:01.440]  they had different names for it paying compliance CPS let's finish up this
[02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:07.160]  video here it is you look in today's LA Times where you've had a repressive
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:11.360]  government in there for 30 years where people haven't voted it's the same thing
[02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:16.280]  that's happening in the corruption in Afghanistan and corruption in Iraq short
[02:02:16.280 --> 02:02:21.200]  of rebellion mr. fine implores us to take the only action left to us while we
[02:02:21.200 --> 02:02:27.720]  still have the ability to act and you vote the bums out and that is what it
[02:02:27.720 --> 02:02:32.440]  comes down to this is only a brief excerpt of an exclusive jailhouse
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:37.240]  interview where Richard fine explains how all the forces from greedy local
[02:02:37.240 --> 02:02:41.960]  developers to the state bar association to the night circuit court of appeals
[02:02:41.960 --> 02:02:46.960]  all conspired to protect the illegal payments that are still being paid to
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:53.600]  the LA Superior Court judges and you can go to info wars.com and link through
[02:02:53.600 --> 02:02:57.240]  we're gonna have them on next week and they've reached out to us that's how we
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:00.440]  even know about this I mean I knew about the Supreme Court issue and this guy's
[02:03:00.440 --> 02:03:04.360]  case I've seen in a few newspapers but I didn't realize the full magnitude so
[02:03:04.360 --> 02:03:07.440]  we're in contact with them we're gonna try to get more of the interview to play
[02:03:07.440 --> 02:03:12.240]  here next week because mr. fine is behind bars there is a protest coming up

[02:03:28.480 --> 02:03:32.760]  courts work unelected criminal courts that just take people's property without
[02:03:32.760 --> 02:03:35.800]  due process how do you think the environmental courts work taking people's
[02:03:35.800 --> 02:03:40.720]  farms and ranches without due process I mean how do you think the CPS there's
[02:03:40.720 --> 02:03:45.000]  no jury they didn't have them till about a hundred years ago or less about 95
[02:03:45.000 --> 02:03:51.440]  years ago England over a hundred years ago had set up racial hygiene family
[02:03:51.440 --> 02:03:56.640]  courts to sterilize people eugenics the US adopted it in the US finance Germany
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:04:01.400]  the Kaiser Velhom Institute and then Adolf Hitler to do what he did family
[02:04:01.400 --> 02:04:07.840]  courts are part of the health department it is a eugenics guild to mop up and go
[02:04:07.840 --> 02:04:15.160]  after society and it's not due process so this is all heavily inculcated and
[02:04:15.160 --> 02:04:21.400]  then now it talks about kids that did nothing wrong swept up by police they
[02:04:21.400 --> 02:04:25.760]  were getting paid off this is in Philadelphia sent in and given year long

[02:08:37.680 --> 02:08:41.720]  wanted to get him on to talk about the deterioration in the world what he
[02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:44.600]  what he predicted two and a half three years ago that they would come out for
[02:08:44.600 --> 02:08:48.560]  the pension funds that the banks would further bankrupt society that they would
[02:08:48.560 --> 02:08:54.840]  cut city and county services all the same time raising taxes that tax
[02:08:54.840 --> 02:08:58.880]  rebellions would form that people would be on the streets again this is two and
[02:08:58.880 --> 02:09:04.680]  a half three years ago that's now all beginning to happen and where he sees
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:08.240]  this going also Obama fear-mongering we know Governor Ridge put out fake terror
[02:09:08.240 --> 02:09:14.440]  alerts and has now admitted it you know the nuclear 9-11 now Obama saying this

[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:48.760]  developing and unfolding and happening and I have my list of questions but what's
[02:09:48.760 --> 02:09:52.880]  coming out in the next trends journal what are you focused on right now the
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:57.440]  next trends journal is going to be out in a day or two and the headline story
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:03.000]  is the great war they're leading us to the great war the first great war of the
[02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:07.040]  new millennium and you touched on it with the fear-mongering that they're
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:13.280]  throwing out there let's go back to 1920s it was the same scheme just a
[02:10:13.280 --> 02:10:19.200]  different time the Wall Street gang bankrupted the nation they had a
[02:10:19.200 --> 02:10:24.600]  different Ponzi scheme or a Madoff scheme and with the markets crashed in
[02:10:24.600 --> 02:10:30.480]  29 we go into a severe depression and what do they do they lead you to war
[02:10:30.480 --> 02:10:35.920]  after they try everything else we're about to have the bailout bubble burst
[02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:41.240]  first we had the dot-com bubble go bust they reinflated that with the real
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:46.120]  estate and credit crisis bubble that broke rather than letting the big boys
[02:10:46.120 --> 02:10:50.400]  on Wall Street lose any money they loaned they loaned them trillions of
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:56.000]  dollars for free to keep juicing this economy and it makes it look like there's
[02:10:56.000 --> 02:11:01.480]  a recovery it's no recovery they covered it up with this Santa money and that's
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:04.960]  going to run out it's going to run out globally you see what's going on in
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:09.720]  Greece you see what's going on in the Ukraine and you said that a year ago you
[02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:12.720]  said it would run out and that they would want more and now they're saying
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:18.240]  not just more bailout now the bankers are telling us we want value added we
[02:11:18.240 --> 02:11:23.240]  want carbon taxes we want sales taxes and we're going to destroy the economy
[02:11:23.240 --> 02:11:27.320]  just like back in October of 08 when they held this hostage they said you give
[02:11:27.320 --> 02:11:30.720]  us unlimited trillions and you let us keep it secret or there's going to be a
[02:11:30.720 --> 02:11:34.960]  depression and Congress said no so they went out in bad mouth the economy the
[02:11:34.960 --> 02:11:39.000]  stock market plunged by almost half Congress passed it and now they're
[02:11:39.000 --> 02:11:43.200]  holding his hostage again that's right and what they're going to do and this is
[02:11:43.200 --> 02:11:48.240]  with the trends journals all about it's the great war and tracking trends is the
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:53.440]  knowledge of where we are clear understanding how we got here so that
[02:11:53.440 --> 02:11:58.560]  we can see where we're going and you go look back at the last two great wars
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:02.880]  that they've that they've foisted on the American economy look what had they
[02:12:02.880 --> 02:12:07.080]  started with Afghanistan it began with we're going to get it oh some have been
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:12.200]  laden and those evil doers and bring them to justice and now ten years later
[02:12:12.200 --> 02:12:17.640]  no Osama bin Laden now they're giving a free but a blind eye to opium production
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:21.880]  that's a New York Times story we're not making that up and then the Afghan the
[02:12:21.880 --> 02:12:26.560]  Iraq war is a total loser and now they're extending the war into Pakistan and
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:31.480]  that's a big one so what we're looking at is the great war they're taking the
[02:12:31.480 --> 02:12:39.880]  world to war look they look at who these people are Obama Bush Clinton Gates
[02:12:39.880 --> 02:12:46.280]  McChrystal they're their levels between psychopaths and sociopaths and that's
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:12:51.440]  all they are and people are looking up to these people and most of them of
[02:12:51.440 --> 02:12:55.720]  course you know they've never worn a uniform or for it and one and they all
[02:12:55.720 --> 02:13:02.560]  talk about what we have to do we mean you and me and the taxes are the other
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:09.600]  issue so that's what we're writing about well I mean you called it the banks
[02:13:09.600 --> 02:13:13.480]  are openly telling the government what to do just like Iceland just like Greece
[02:13:13.480 --> 02:13:21.040]  and I want to get back into the big war and how they plan to get there but but
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:25.960]  let's first move back to the domestic front what is Washington thinking 22
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:32.520]  plus percent real unemployment job list claims going way up people's pay going
[02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:39.040]  way down the economy definitely going into depression and the government at
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:43.080]  the federal level is just growing growing growing meanwhile Ohio Texas
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:47.400]  Michigan New Jersey laying off half the cops or more than half the sheriff's
[02:13:47.400 --> 02:13:53.040]  deputies in many cities four day a week school they're making DMV workers in
[02:13:53.040 --> 02:13:57.600]  California work five days only be paid for four can't people recognize that
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:03.520]  we're going into a third world Argentine or Nigerian scenario where 90% of the
[02:14:03.520 --> 02:14:08.440]  money goes to the Madoff's through their fraud and then we pay more taxes but we
[02:14:08.440 --> 02:14:12.760]  get less services I mean this isn't this is insane well let's take the first
[02:14:12.760 --> 02:14:17.640]  question you asked what are they thinking about this is the red carpet
[02:14:17.640 --> 02:14:22.240]  crowd they don't think about anything look at the way that they live
[02:14:22.240 --> 02:14:28.000]  everywhere they go they fly around in jet planes big enough to move a half a
[02:14:28.000 --> 02:14:34.600]  city every time they arrive their great carpet comes out they salute the band
[02:14:34.600 --> 02:14:40.840]  plays and they have great dinners and it goes on from the secretaries of this
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:46.240]  or that to all these two bit congressmen that are treated like royalty every time
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:51.920]  they go abroad they're thinking of nothing but themselves that's why they're
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:58.880]  politicians and any adult that believes a politician is going to look out for
[02:14:58.880 --> 02:15:04.000]  their benefit really has to have their head examined Ronald Reagan said at best
[02:15:04.000 --> 02:15:08.640]  he said they're the second oldest profession but at least with the first
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:15.240]  oldest profession you end up with a happy ending so what we're looking at
[02:15:15.240 --> 02:15:20.680]  here is they don't care where the economy is going as long as they continue to live
[02:15:20.680 --> 02:15:26.280]  in the style that they've been accustomed to these are not smart people
[02:15:26.280 --> 02:15:32.960]  listen to the words they always talk about Obama for example being quote a
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:39.400]  brilliant politician that's it that's as far as it goes Hillary Clinton a
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:46.280]  politician they're politicians why don't people grow up and understand what
[02:15:46.280 --> 02:15:50.320]  they're going to get they're gonna get the shaft and they're getting it but
[02:15:50.320 --> 02:15:55.360]  again after all this dies down and they're pumping it up now with this
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:16:01.960]  stupid nuclear summit that they just held and that they're waving the the
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:08.920]  red flag at Iran and and by the way the other one is going to be where we're
[02:16:08.920 --> 02:16:13.600]  most concerned about what's going to happen with Israel that story jumped
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:18.040]  out of the news overnight when they said that they were going to continue to
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:23.240]  build housing developments on occupied land which is against the UN
[02:16:23.240 --> 02:16:30.000]  resolutions against international law they brushed it over they did not hear
[02:16:30.000 --> 02:16:36.240]  Netanyahu did not come to that nuclear summit although Israel is alleged to
[02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:42.640]  have between 100 and 400 nuclear warheads so we can see where we're
[02:16:42.640 --> 02:16:47.840]  leading here and we believe that there's going to be something going on between
[02:16:47.840 --> 02:16:53.640]  Israel and Iran that the United States is going to go into it with them and when
[02:16:53.640 --> 02:17:00.280]  this happens it's the beginning of the great war and by the way Russian
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:05.280]  president Menyedyev said two days ago to her it's he said Israel don't attack Iran
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:11.000]  this could cause World War 3 a global catastrophe and I've interviewed top
[02:17:11.000 --> 02:17:15.560]  former Pentagon and CIA analyst I've read what the others are saying it all
[02:17:15.560 --> 02:17:21.240]  runs from bad to worse a huge regional war oil prices tripling our troops
[02:17:21.240 --> 02:17:28.280]  being attacked depression that's on the bad to the worse starting a nuclear
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:32.640]  war with Russia and China and we saw Cheney running that sneak attack with
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:36.480]  the Georgians on 888 that's now been declassified that he wanted to start war
[02:17:36.480 --> 02:17:41.280]  so sure you got a lot of these political whores and idiots in Washington like
[02:17:41.280 --> 02:17:45.600]  congressman Hank Johnson who believes that islands are floating and they may
[02:17:45.600 --> 02:17:49.400]  capsize I mean he's now said on record no he believes islands float but you've
[02:17:49.400 --> 02:17:53.960]  also got the big banks and corporations the white shoe boys you talk about who
[02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:57.760]  I mean they've taken over they've stolen trillions they're running things I mean
[02:17:57.760 --> 02:18:02.480]  they're I mean so there's also some smart ones in there of course and you know
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:06.280]  that great quote we have that one in the trends journal which I know you know
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:10.960]  about a Smedley Butler the most decorated marine at the time marine
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:16.160]  history calling war a racket and he talks about how he doesn't want to fight
[02:18:16.160 --> 02:18:23.680]  anymore for the Brown brothers which is you know another was another brokerage
[02:18:23.680 --> 02:18:28.640]  firm that was the busiest and the banks he talks about it it's a racket and
[02:18:28.640 --> 02:18:33.560]  that's what people have to know the banks are robbing it's the greatest bank
[02:18:33.560 --> 02:18:38.360]  robbery in American history in world history and the banks are doing the
[02:18:38.360 --> 02:18:44.240]  robbing they could care less about us Alex their money junkies their junkies
[02:18:44.240 --> 02:18:49.040]  just like a chunky needs his heroin they need their money they never have
[02:18:49.040 --> 02:18:53.440]  enough you look at that guy buffing you I want more billions I want more
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:57.240]  billions when do you have enough and that's what they're doing the gap
[02:18:57.240 --> 02:19:02.320]  between the rich and the poor is the widest in the United States than any of
[02:19:02.320 --> 02:19:08.560]  the industrialized nations we went from the most egalitarian post-war war to to
[02:19:08.560 --> 02:19:13.960]  now where only the rich have everything and the rest of us and we have to pay
[02:19:13.960 --> 02:19:18.560]  more taxes so they could get more exactly and they're sickening the poor
[02:19:18.560 --> 02:19:22.680]  people on the dwindling middle class by saying the rich people is somebody who
[02:19:22.680 --> 02:19:26.680]  makes 200,000 a year they're raising the taxes on the one group that's
[02:19:26.680 --> 02:19:31.280]  actually employing people exactly and the small businesses oh look at the new
[02:19:31.280 --> 02:19:36.960]  legislation coming out that's going to hurt family farms so the big farms could
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:40.520]  take more of the action let's talk about that Gerald Salenta we come back

[02:22:28.520 --> 02:22:31.960]  institution that is not accountable to our elected government but has also
[02:22:31.960 --> 02:22:36.120]  caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value now foreign

[02:24:07.520 --> 02:24:11.760]  this criminal takeover is so outrageous I feel like just standing in front of
[02:24:11.760 --> 02:24:15.520]  a major bank it's a fellow reserve shareholder and just screaming they're
[02:24:15.520 --> 02:24:19.320]  robbing us they're robbing us with a sign that's what Gerald Salente saying
[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:24.160]  it's so outrageous there's a lot of anger but it's not the level it should be
[02:24:24.160 --> 02:24:28.200]  we'll talk about provocateurs we've been recovering this for a month now the AP
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:32.600]  admits the Democrats are infiltrating tea parties and posing as racist they've
[02:24:32.600 --> 02:24:37.520]  been caught red-handed trying to false flag us but Gerald you were getting into
[02:24:37.520 --> 02:24:43.400]  how they're attacking any group or any system that allows us to be dependent on
[02:24:43.400 --> 02:24:48.120]  ourselves not dependent on the system they don't want us to be self-sufficient
[02:24:48.120 --> 02:24:53.360]  well precisely look what happened this country went from you know a nation of
[02:24:53.360 --> 02:24:59.000]  entrepreneurs and when that where we were when we were all about mom and pops
[02:24:59.000 --> 02:25:04.920]  and Main Street and family farms we were the most egalitarian nation on earth
[02:25:04.920 --> 02:25:10.120]  and now the level of the playing field has been changed that that only the big
[02:25:10.120 --> 02:25:14.080]  guys get the big breaks and as I mentioned the gap between the rich and
[02:25:14.080 --> 02:25:19.720]  the poor is now the widest in the US of any of the industrialized nations so
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:25.400]  for example there's a big push going on now for people that want to buy local
[02:25:25.400 --> 02:25:31.360]  they want to buy family farm foods well now they're pushing through
[02:25:31.360 --> 02:25:37.160]  legislation that's going to put a big burden on the family farms and they're
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:42.840]  bringing in the federal inspectors to make sure that they follow the
[02:25:42.840 --> 02:25:50.560]  regulations to a tee as they turn a blind eye to the big guys so now the main
[02:25:50.560 --> 02:25:56.160]  streets are deserted we've seen what happened to the family farms the trends
[02:25:56.160 --> 02:26:01.680]  are moving favorably back in those directions and what are they doing they're
[02:26:01.680 --> 02:26:07.600]  not gonna let it happen they're going to make sure that we becomes a service
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:15.600]  a sec sector society think of the word servitude service surf hey look at the
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:23.800]  great jobs you want to be a cashier at a 7-eleven hey I got one for you how
[02:26:23.800 --> 02:26:29.440]  about working at Walmart said two in the morning and crawling between shelves to
[02:26:29.440 --> 02:26:34.960]  stop them that's what they're doing to the American public and then they're
[02:26:34.960 --> 02:26:40.280]  gonna take us to war when all else fails we're gonna get back into that when
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:43.040]  we start the next segment that's the key here and I've got a whole host of
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:47.360]  issues I want to go through with the top trends forecaster in the world wrote the
[02:26:47.360 --> 02:26:51.760]  book on its stunning accuracy in his trends again we're so honored to have

[02:26:55.680 --> 02:27:00.120]  joined us but I want to back you up on what you just said animal ID premises ID
[02:27:00.120 --> 02:27:04.320]  on both sides of my family I come from farmers and ranchers they come in with
[02:27:04.320 --> 02:27:08.840]  regulations they say you've got to have premises ID animal ID you've got to have
[02:27:08.840 --> 02:27:15.200]  a $14 tag per chicken in your small chicken coop they have federal inspectors
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:20.720]  that the news admits are focused on small farms and small outfits $14 tag per
[02:27:20.720 --> 02:27:24.600]  turkey you can only sell the chicken for three four bucks to one of the big
[02:27:24.600 --> 02:27:29.800]  groups one of the big combines that processes them but then Tyson chicken is
[02:27:29.800 --> 02:27:35.760]  exempt and gets one ID per 10,000 chickens because they wrote the
[02:27:35.760 --> 02:27:40.680]  regulations to shut down their competition they allow all this dirty beef
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:44.400]  to be shipped in from all over the world they put more regulations on US beef
[02:27:44.400 --> 02:27:48.480]  producers and our own news media put out today that our beef is dirty when our
[02:27:48.480 --> 02:27:52.520]  beef is some of the cleanest and best in the world everything by these globalist
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:57.080]  is economic warfare expanding on that they're trying to shut down vitamins and

[02:28:11.680 --> 02:28:16.840]  mean you see it all the time and then they crush at this the small people for
[02:28:16.840 --> 02:28:21.640]  the smallest infraction and they let the big guys get away with murder
[02:28:21.640 --> 02:28:26.280]  literally and look what look right here in New York State it's great we had
[02:28:26.280 --> 02:28:31.600]  Elliott Spitz the esteemed governor you know he was caught with a prostitute

[02:35:08.120 --> 02:35:11.840]  trends in the next hour but I'm gonna try to shut up here and just ask quick
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:16.040]  questions but with key points I know governments of stage terror I know
[02:35:16.040 --> 02:35:19.680]  operation north woods is an official US government plan to stage 9-11 style
[02:35:19.680 --> 02:35:23.480]  attacks I don't put it past these bankers this isn't our government anymore
[02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:28.440]  these corporate mafia from staging a dirty bomb or even a nuke or busting
[02:35:28.440 --> 02:35:32.880]  somebody in a fake attack imagine the clamp down they could have the only way
[02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:36.240]  I see them being able to launch their war on Iran which they're now trying to
[02:35:36.240 --> 02:35:42.400]  blame suitcase nukes on use of a massive crisis we've already been lied to about
[02:35:42.400 --> 02:35:46.800]  fictitious WMD's in Iraq once now they're just coming back with the same
[02:35:46.800 --> 02:35:51.480]  story but I do see them staging terror I've seen them hyping that the tea
[02:35:51.480 --> 02:35:55.320]  parties are violent they've been caught planting people in there even the AP now
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:36:02.200]  yesterday so everything I see them do is false flag setups frame ups how do you
[02:36:02.200 --> 02:36:06.240]  see them getting us into a war which the rand corporation said two years ago
[02:36:06.240 --> 02:36:12.080]  they need to build their new world order well we believe it's the Iran is
[02:36:12.080 --> 02:36:19.680]  going to be the target the other one is there really may be a terror strike
[02:36:19.680 --> 02:36:26.400]  legitimately coming out of Pakistan this should be the major news every day
[02:36:26.400 --> 02:36:32.040]  virtually they're sending predator drones in and killing scores of innocent
[02:36:32.040 --> 02:36:39.080]  people I believe the number is well over a thousand now in the last year it this
[02:36:39.080 --> 02:36:44.760]  is as old as the Old Testament it's an eye for an eye you have the greatest
[02:36:44.760 --> 02:36:52.240]  refugee crisis going on in Pakistan since Rwanda and they're escalating that
[02:36:52.240 --> 02:36:59.600]  war even more and of course the CIA is behind sending these drones in since
[02:36:59.600 --> 02:37:06.720]  when was the CIA supposed to be in the battle like this I thought they were
[02:37:06.720 --> 02:37:11.840]  only there to collect intelligence so we're really looking at something Alex
[02:37:11.840 --> 02:37:17.720]  where we have well over 200,000 Pakistanis in this country they're
[02:37:17.720 --> 02:37:24.440]  watching their families get murdered you think they're going to be angry they're
[02:37:24.440 --> 02:37:30.040]  going to say when terrorist strikes they hate our freedom and liberty how
[02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:34.960]  about they hate your foreign policy and they hate you for killing innocent
[02:37:34.960 --> 02:37:41.160]  people look what happened in Afghanistan two days ago they strafe the
[02:37:41.160 --> 02:37:48.720]  passenger bus there's plenty of hatred out there false flag or real we're
[02:37:48.720 --> 02:37:56.160]  forecasting in 2010 a 9-11 magnitude terrorist strike and we're saying this
[02:37:56.160 --> 02:38:02.240]  as well so people can take proactive measures what does it mean well it means
[02:38:02.240 --> 02:38:06.800]  the things that you're talking about with on your show the products the the
[02:38:06.800 --> 02:38:12.160]  survival products but it all and it means having gold to us but it also means
[02:38:12.160 --> 02:38:18.840]  what happened after 9-11 they shut the Wall Street down I couldn't cash in my
[02:38:18.840 --> 02:38:24.040]  CDs because I wanted to get away from here because Indian Point nuclear power
[02:38:24.040 --> 02:38:30.240]  plant is just north of 9-11 and I'm of ground zero and I'm just north of that
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:35.440]  so I went to get my CDs I couldn't get them out because Wall Street was closed
[02:38:35.440 --> 02:38:41.440]  their financial instruments this time when 9-11 magnitude terrorist strikes we
[02:38:41.440 --> 02:38:45.640]  forecast they're going to close the banks you're not going to be able to get
[02:38:45.640 --> 02:38:51.280]  your money out the end and there's going to be cyber attacks as well and when
[02:38:51.280 --> 02:38:56.160]  you do get your money out a little bit they'll let you take out at a time it's
[02:38:56.160 --> 02:39:01.240]  going to be devalued just like they devalued it under FDR when they called
[02:39:01.240 --> 02:39:06.960]  a bank holiday just like they devalued it in Argentina they'll devalue it again
[02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:11.320]  that's one of the ways they're going to try to get out of this financial
[02:39:11.320 --> 02:39:17.880]  mountain of debt that's bringing down the nation and just to back you up we see
[02:39:17.880 --> 02:39:21.080]  Citibank and the other big banks saying well hold your money for seven days we
[02:39:21.080 --> 02:39:25.480]  see Bloomberg federal regulators are ordering public and private pension
[02:39:25.480 --> 02:39:29.000]  funds since when can you do that in a free country to invest in failed banks
[02:39:29.000 --> 02:39:32.080]  that's a quote in fact print me the Bloomberg or Business Week again it
[02:39:32.080 --> 02:39:36.560]  actually says and now Argentina just took their pension funds Greece is talking
[02:39:36.560 --> 02:39:40.200]  about taking their pension funds they tried to take the Icelandic pension funds
[02:39:40.200 --> 02:39:45.720]  but the people rioted for a year and said no and so I mean this is
[02:39:45.720 --> 02:39:48.600]  incredible they're openly saying they're gonna take the pension funds the
[02:39:48.600 --> 02:39:53.080]  cyber security bill passed the house now in the Senate says for any emergency
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:57.680]  including financial the president can quote shut down the internet or
[02:39:57.680 --> 02:40:02.520]  selectively shut down the web we see internet censorship passing in Italy we
[02:40:02.520 --> 02:40:06.520]  see it passing in France we see it passing last week in England we see
[02:40:06.520 --> 02:40:10.960]  national publications main mainly singling me out saying I'm calling for
[02:40:10.960 --> 02:40:15.480]  violence when I'm not calling for censoring us I mean so clearly you
[02:40:15.480 --> 02:40:20.200]  can see them lining everything up and getting ready for a war as a political
[02:40:20.200 --> 02:40:24.840]  distraction but the real enemy is us fleecing us further and like a bully
[02:40:24.840 --> 02:40:30.960]  sitting on our chest pounding us in the face breaking our will so the criminal
[02:40:30.960 --> 02:40:35.920]  made-offs and Ken lay types that run our society they're trying to go for broke
[02:40:35.920 --> 02:40:40.400]  and then make sure they can protect themselves from the people exactly like
[02:40:40.400 --> 02:40:45.280]  I said these are nothing more than money junkies they can't get enough just like
[02:40:45.280 --> 02:40:50.880]  a heroin addict they have no bounds no boundaries no loyalties they'll do
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:56.080]  anything to get their money fix and that's what's going on now and then the
[02:40:56.080 --> 02:41:01.800]  other ones the politicians they need their power fix so it's a perfect
[02:41:01.800 --> 02:41:07.920]  group they're there they're the gang and they are destroying this nation and as
[02:41:07.920 --> 02:41:13.440]  we've said before people railing about old nationalism and socialism it's
[02:41:13.440 --> 02:41:18.400]  fascism the merger of state and corporate powers oh here's a beauty for
[02:41:18.400 --> 02:41:24.920]  you today you know this contest this private equity firm Syrabus that they
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:32.800]  own Chrysler and they also own 51% of GMAC and this private equity group is
[02:41:32.800 --> 02:41:43.280]  the chairman and CEO is John Snow he was the Treasury Secretary before Hank
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:48.760]  Paulson on the bush one of the board of directors is that brilliant shining
[02:41:48.760 --> 02:41:55.160]  light of intelligence and integrity Dan quail well today it was announced that
[02:41:55.160 --> 02:42:02.080]  Syrabus just bought Dinecorp you know those mercenaries those soldiers of the
[02:42:02.080 --> 02:42:09.520]  Fortune 500 those military contractors that's what's going on we bail out
[02:42:09.520 --> 02:42:16.640]  Chrysler we bail out GMAC and what do they do with that money they buy another
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:22.560]  piece of the war it's a racket just follow the names I've said this over and
[02:42:22.560 --> 02:42:27.640]  over and I'll say it again if the names on Wall Street were named Salenti
[02:42:27.640 --> 02:42:34.920]  Caruso Mondavi Puccini Rossini they call it the mafia but when you call it Dan
[02:42:34.920 --> 02:42:41.760]  quail in John Snow and Hank Paulson oh no they're just public servants and
[02:42:41.760 --> 02:42:49.320]  really really swell financial geniuses well Gerald Solente I had Catherine
[02:42:49.320 --> 02:42:55.640]  Austin Fitz you know high-level former federal officer you know brilliant woman
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:43:00.240]  yeah absolutely you know headed up HUD and when she discovered all of this and
[02:43:00.240 --> 02:43:06.320]  she was she said Alex you had a show on about CPS take people's kids and you
[02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:09.600]  didn't know and she sent us the documents in mainstream news articles I mean I
[02:43:09.600 --> 02:43:12.440]  don't know everything in fact I don't know much the more I learn the more I
[02:43:12.440 --> 02:43:17.400]  know how much I don't know I didn't know Dinecorp its biggest business in the US
[02:43:17.400 --> 02:43:22.680]  is running CPS so the counties and cities stealing people's kids without due
[02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:28.680]  process and then selling them off literally to adoption agencies once I
[02:43:28.680 --> 02:43:31.840]  found out about it I Google searched it there were thousands of articles Dine
[02:43:31.840 --> 02:43:36.480]  Corps is now not just running white slavery rings as the Chicago Tribune
[02:43:36.480 --> 02:43:41.440]  reported a few years ago overseas in Serbia they're here running it so now
[02:43:41.440 --> 02:43:45.440]  these Pentagon groups are literally hunting us and our children and I
[02:43:45.440 --> 02:43:50.560]  didn't even know it think of what else I don't know and you know before we were
[02:43:50.560 --> 02:43:55.680]  talking about how they're clamping down on the little people regulations oh they
[02:43:55.680 --> 02:44:01.800]  just came out with the latest IRS reports and how they're not going after
[02:44:01.800 --> 02:44:07.280]  big corporations that's right they're going after the little people don't the
[02:44:07.280 --> 02:44:12.400]  people see what's going on over here they're going to crush the rebellion
[02:44:12.400 --> 02:44:18.400]  before it starts we're making it really clear we're calling for an intellectual
[02:44:18.400 --> 02:44:23.800]  revolution one of the mines not guns because you're not gonna outgun these
[02:44:23.800 --> 02:44:29.520]  guys and anybody that thinks they are they're out of their minds they'll crush
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:35.200]  you like a net we we want a revolution in this country before with mines we
[02:44:35.200 --> 02:44:39.360]  could win it again and it and it and that's what we're saying that can't
[02:44:39.360 --> 02:44:46.400]  happen you know it's that 20% solution it's the people that will not follow the
[02:44:46.400 --> 02:44:52.400]  deranged that want to turn them into murderers to fight other wars that say
[02:44:52.400 --> 02:44:58.560]  no we're going to stop and if we stop these wars and we start concentrating
[02:44:58.560 --> 02:45:05.000]  and bringing the resources back to this country we can rebuild it step by step
[02:45:05.000 --> 02:45:09.600]  well I agree with you here it is failed banks may get pension fund backing as
[02:45:09.600 --> 02:45:14.480]  FDIC six cash business week and this is now all over the news it was in the
[02:45:14.480 --> 02:45:18.480]  London Telegraph yesterday the federal deposit insurance core is trying to
[02:45:18.480 --> 02:45:22.000]  encourage public retirement funds that control more than two trillion to buy
[02:45:22.000 --> 02:45:26.840]  all are part of failed lenders so the big banks move their money out the back
[02:45:26.840 --> 02:45:30.800]  door and buy real assets then they put the public on the hook so all these
[02:45:30.800 --> 02:45:34.640]  cops and people being replaced by Dinecore now to snatch kids they're
[02:45:34.640 --> 02:45:38.720]  going to take your pension funds and it goes on to say the government is
[02:45:38.720 --> 02:45:44.120]  ordering the pension funds to invest in failed banks since when in the land of
[02:45:44.120 --> 02:45:49.880]  the free home of the brave does the government regulators order the pension
[02:45:49.880 --> 02:45:53.040]  funds were to put their money well it's all selectively enforced I want to back
[02:45:53.040 --> 02:45:57.600]  you up here if they don't the laws millions of laws there's millions are
[02:45:57.600 --> 02:46:01.520]  written where nobody can follow the law it's all selectively enforced so they'll
[02:46:01.520 --> 02:46:04.360]  go in and shut them down that's what Catherine Austin Fitz said and agreed
[02:46:04.360 --> 02:46:08.400]  with me here last week but then you talked about the articles in the Wall
[02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:13.320]  Street Journal in New York Times in the last year that I've seen where not only
[02:46:13.320 --> 02:46:20.360]  have they cut almost all of the white collar investigators off of big banks
[02:46:20.360 --> 02:46:24.960]  big corporations that pay almost no tax it's reported but when they do bust a
[02:46:24.960 --> 02:46:29.160]  Swiss bank account and make it big news and Reuters today it was for 200,000
[02:46:29.160 --> 02:46:33.360]  dollars so they're busting little bitty chump level that sounds a lot to a
[02:46:33.360 --> 02:46:36.640]  McDonald's worker but that's nothing you know to the elite who are in the
[02:46:36.640 --> 02:46:40.720]  trillions and hundreds of billions individually in some cases and then I
[02:46:40.720 --> 02:46:43.280]  remember reading articles about now they're not even having them go after
[02:46:43.280 --> 02:46:47.840]  upper middle class it's after blue collar people 35,000 and and and that
[02:46:47.840 --> 02:46:52.520]  they send two uniformed officers to Sacramento to a guy's car wash that
[02:46:52.520 --> 02:46:58.560]  hadn't paid four cents fact pull that up was two or four cents Sacramento B car
[02:46:58.560 --> 02:47:03.200]  wash visit over two cents and they threatened him over two cents again
[02:47:03.200 --> 02:47:07.680]  they've got the few investigators going after people for two cents well the same
[02:47:07.680 --> 02:47:12.440]  thing here in New York they're busting people to go into beauty parlors to get
[02:47:12.440 --> 02:47:17.520]  all the sales tax they can little cafe owners they're cracking down on the
[02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:21.960]  little people and they have the goons squads behind them there's a lot of
[02:47:21.960 --> 02:47:25.680]  things going on right now that people should be watching around the world and
[02:47:25.680 --> 02:47:30.020]  and one of them of course is Greece this is just the beginning we could
[02:47:30.020 --> 02:47:34.880]  actually see the breakup of the economic the European monetary Union there's
[02:47:34.880 --> 02:47:37.200]  gonna be people there's gonna be countries that aren't gonna be able to
[02:47:37.200 --> 02:47:42.640]  cut it but also look at the riots going on in Thailand look what's going on in
[02:47:42.640 --> 02:47:48.640]  Kazakhstan look what's going on in Latvia Lithuania the Ukraine we're going to
[02:47:48.640 --> 02:47:53.640]  see the the seeds of war or already fermenting they're blossoming they're
[02:47:53.640 --> 02:47:58.160]  coming up from the ground look what happened in Hungary again people should
[02:47:58.160 --> 02:48:02.960]  really take a global view they just brought in of they just brought in a
[02:48:02.960 --> 02:48:09.440]  very right-wing government and the the neo-nazi party they just got almost 20
[02:48:09.440 --> 02:48:14.440]  percent of the vote so we're going to start seeing some real backlashes going
[02:48:14.440 --> 02:48:19.760]  on and and the other thing that we're we're forecasting is that when the
[02:48:19.760 --> 02:48:24.960]  stimulus money runs out the crash is going to happen and we believe it's
[02:48:24.960 --> 02:48:30.360]  going to be a currency crash and again look what's going on in Europe and and
[02:48:30.360 --> 02:48:34.240]  they're covering it up they it's really it's much worse than they're making it
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:41.320]  seem even with Greece and you go back to December of of 09 a couple of months
[02:48:41.320 --> 02:48:45.640]  ago they said oh don't worry about it the Greece problem is not going to be a
[02:48:45.640 --> 02:48:50.520]  big one we can take care of it well they just broke the rules they said they
[02:48:50.520 --> 02:48:56.280]  would never under the master agreement bail out a failed country and now
[02:48:56.280 --> 02:49:02.040]  they're doing it so the entire systems are failing and people better plan for
[02:49:02.040 --> 02:49:08.360]  the worst and and a correction their CBS news will throw it back up on screen
[02:49:08.360 --> 02:49:14.160]  Sacramento car wash gets IRS visit over four cents I was going for memory I'm
[02:49:14.160 --> 02:49:20.120]  sorry it was over a lot more money it was four cents imagine sending the IRS to
[02:49:20.120 --> 02:49:24.680]  threaten someone over four cents what are these IRS agents thinking they can't
[02:49:24.680 --> 02:49:28.600]  go after Bernie Madoff but they can go after somebody with four cents well
[02:49:28.600 --> 02:49:33.720]  again that's the whole system it's the cops crashing down look if you have two
[02:49:33.720 --> 02:49:39.120]  glasses of wine and they stop you they'll throw you against the car and handcuff
[02:49:39.120 --> 02:49:45.440]  you and send you to jail I mean come on it's squeezed the little people this is
[02:49:45.440 --> 02:49:51.600]  classic when an empire is in decline and America is that declining empire so
[02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:55.960]  that's what happens and that's why revolts begin as you said they have the
[02:49:55.960 --> 02:49:59.880]  agents provocateur that they keep putting in whether it's a peaceful
[02:49:59.880 --> 02:50:04.400]  demonstration and all of a sudden you see a squad of guys coming out and they
[02:50:04.400 --> 02:50:09.440]  call them anarchists with masks on and who are they they're the police and
[02:50:09.440 --> 02:50:13.880]  they're making it look as though it's the the average person that's causing the
[02:50:13.880 --> 02:50:18.560]  damage and the same thing as you pointed out the infiltrators of these tea
[02:50:18.560 --> 02:50:23.760]  parties so we're really in a very crucial time right now and we could go
[02:50:23.760 --> 02:50:30.720]  either way but the unquestionably after the stimulus high runs out the economy
[02:50:30.720 --> 02:50:36.800]  is going to crash they're gonna try to keep it alive for the 2010 midterm
[02:50:36.800 --> 02:50:41.600]  elections but after that it's going to it's going to fall apart but we're
[02:50:41.600 --> 02:50:46.240]  forecasting actually it may happen even before then you're saying before the
[02:50:46.240 --> 02:50:50.960]  10th 2010 stay there we're gonna come back get into your forecast on the
[02:50:50.960 --> 02:50:54.400]  economy and then take phone calls a whole nother hour is here also let they

[02:51:14.360 --> 02:51:18.400]  government has the authority to take what has been given to us by God among

[02:54:10.840 --> 02:54:15.880]  groups all over the country are infiltrating the tea parties to poses
[02:54:15.880 --> 02:54:20.760]  racist and do other things well here is a Braverton teacher faces
[02:54:20.760 --> 02:54:24.240]  investigation over tea party infiltration he also has accompanied
[02:54:24.240 --> 02:54:29.760]  supplies much of the city with their internet and I've said this is racketeering
[02:54:29.760 --> 02:54:34.120]  you try to go to peaceful political protest and make them look like cooks
[02:54:34.120 --> 02:54:37.280]  or make them look like racists as other groups are saying they're going to do or
[02:54:37.280 --> 02:54:40.720]  try to cause violence as other groups are saying that's racketeering that's
[02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:46.200]  organized crime getting together to go set people up in the black congressional
[02:54:46.200 --> 02:54:49.960]  caucus walked out in the tea party tried to get them to spit on them try to get
[02:54:49.960 --> 02:54:54.560]  them to call me inward nobody did that the media ran with it and lied this is
[02:54:54.560 --> 02:54:57.920]  the type of propaganda we're talking about Gerald Salentes our guest your
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:01.280]  calls coming up right when we start the next hour and I've got other questions
[02:55:01.280 --> 02:55:05.040]  we're going to intersperse throughout that for Gerald Salente picking his brain
[02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:10.480]  here trends research calm don't forget we've got two new films coming out in
[02:55:10.480 --> 02:55:14.920]  the next week one tomorrow premieres at prison planet TV the DVDs the new film
[02:55:14.920 --> 02:55:19.400]  visible Empire a new order defined are now shipping check out the trailers and
[02:55:19.400 --> 02:55:27.080]  info at info wars calm okay Gerald talking about the economy going under a
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:32.880]  I know you can't put an exact date on it but a danger zone a b is there a way to
[02:55:32.880 --> 02:55:37.080]  stop it and see when they implode it what type of things are they going to try
[02:55:37.080 --> 02:55:42.840]  to steal that the timing is very tough but we're we were looking for something
[02:55:42.840 --> 02:55:47.960]  really to happen between now and and September that that's our that's our
[02:55:47.960 --> 02:55:52.400]  window because you're going to start seeing a lot more commercial real estate
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:57.000]  collapsing you're going to start seeing more sovereign debt problems and then
[02:55:57.000 --> 02:56:01.040]  not going to be able to cover it up anymore and of course the Fed is winding
[02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:06.960]  back on there on their room 1.5 trillion that they're covering this whole
[02:56:06.960 --> 02:56:11.480]  housing bubble with and and that's winding down as well so we're going to
[02:56:11.480 --> 02:56:17.880]  start seeing some very bad sales coming out in real estate as well the how can
[02:56:17.880 --> 02:56:24.080]  it be stopped it can be stopped only a couple of ways one is that we have to
[02:56:24.080 --> 02:56:28.160]  start doing business with each other we're a country of over 300 million
[02:56:28.160 --> 02:56:33.800]  people by American we have to and I'm not a protectionist and I'm certainly not
[02:56:33.800 --> 02:56:39.480]  an isolationist I travel the world but I also have to support my neighbor and my
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:45.440]  neighbors support me because if neither of us do good we all do bad and that's
[02:56:45.440 --> 02:56:50.400]  the way really to as we can see it coming back in is to rebuild this country
[02:56:50.400 --> 02:56:55.400]  brick-by-brick manufacturing by manufacturer it was wonderful to hear
[02:56:55.400 --> 02:57:00.800]  about that jeans company made in America anybody that's looking to get into
[02:57:00.800 --> 02:57:06.280]  business and to make a mark sell made in America the country's yearning for it
[02:57:06.280 --> 02:57:11.280]  really wants it number two in how to bring it back is we need a productive
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:16.960]  capacity as well and the best way we see it is with an alternative energy but
[02:57:16.960 --> 02:57:22.280]  not win solar geothermal a biofuel something much bigger and this isn't
[02:57:22.280 --> 02:57:27.640]  hyperbole go back to when we went in the 1990s and we were in a very severe
[02:57:27.640 --> 02:57:32.800]  recession when Clinton got elected under the mantra it's the economy stupid
[02:57:32.800 --> 02:57:38.000]  what got us out the internet revolution products were invented design
[02:57:38.000 --> 02:57:45.280]  manufactured marketed service we need that with a new energy product and by
[02:57:45.280 --> 02:57:49.600]  the way a magazine I don't have a mentality for it but for those that do
[02:57:49.600 --> 02:57:54.760]  have engineering experience infinite energy they're on the cutting edge with
[02:57:54.760 --> 02:58:01.200]  cold fusion zero-point energy charge clusters permanent magnets something
[02:58:01.200 --> 02:58:06.840]  like that Alex you can't print your way out of this you can't you can't spend
[02:58:06.840 --> 02:58:13.480]  out of it just like you or I if we're deep in debt we don't borrow more money
[02:58:13.480 --> 02:58:20.320]  you can only innovate you've got to innovate out of it exactly when we come
[02:58:20.320 --> 02:58:23.320]  back I want to briefly well we're gonna take calls and I'm gonna ask you about
[02:58:23.320 --> 02:58:27.360]  NASA and I'm not for spending ten billion dollars a year on NASA but if
[02:58:27.360 --> 02:58:31.320]  you're gonna give trillions of the banks over a trillion bucks to the war
[02:58:31.320 --> 02:58:36.320]  every year we can't have ten billion for NASA again everything's got to go to
[02:58:36.320 --> 02:58:43.680]  the war machine and the banks it's killing America we'll be back in one minute

[03:00:06.840 --> 03:00:10.880]  on the drugs report what I've been saying the last three days critics Obama
[03:00:10.880 --> 03:00:15.760]  administration hyping terrorist attack nuclear terror attack US officials say
[03:00:15.760 --> 03:00:19.800]  the claim is not based on new intelligence it is made up just like
[03:00:19.800 --> 03:00:24.720]  when Bush put it out okay now there could be some real terror attacks that's
[03:00:24.720 --> 03:00:29.200]  somebody fighting back like Pakistan or if we attack Iran they've said we're
[03:00:29.200 --> 03:00:33.880]  gonna attack back but Gerald Salente I'm no fan of Iran I'm America first but
[03:00:33.880 --> 03:00:37.400]  it's not America it's banks and corporations leading us into these
[03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:41.200]  wars that are black holes they steal money out of that they use as political
[03:00:41.200 --> 03:00:46.680]  distractions I mean if our country attacks Iran I mean what do people expect
[03:00:46.680 --> 03:00:50.800]  Iran to do I mean to lay there and take it I mean since when do you I mean it'd
[03:00:50.800 --> 03:00:55.920]  be like Nazi Germany attacking England and England not fighting back or it'd
[03:00:55.920 --> 03:01:03.560]  be like you know it's just so asinine Gerald yes it is and again let's look
[03:01:03.560 --> 03:01:07.680]  at the history of Iran first of all these are the Persians they're not going
[03:01:07.680 --> 03:01:13.280]  anywhere there are 75 million of them and you know what have they really done I
[03:01:13.280 --> 03:01:18.440]  don't think that in the last century they haven't colonized anybody they didn't
[03:01:18.440 --> 03:01:23.600]  attack another invade another country I mean when you look at the the people
[03:01:23.600 --> 03:01:29.960]  that are pointing the fingers at Iran particularly the United States France and
[03:01:29.960 --> 03:01:36.000]  Israel you know their track record of colonization starting wars invading
[03:01:36.000 --> 03:01:41.360]  countries and occupying them is a lot worse than Iran's is so why all of a
[03:01:41.360 --> 03:01:47.840]  sudden Iran and what if they do get a nuclear weapon well what are they gonna
[03:01:47.840 --> 03:01:51.880]  do with it they're gonna attack somebody with it everyone knows that if they
[03:01:51.880 --> 03:01:58.400]  used it they'd be annihilated so this is really to get the people angry we need
[03:01:58.400 --> 03:02:03.760]  communism is gone the Germans you know where they during World War two is
[03:02:03.760 --> 03:02:09.680]  long over the Japanese we don't have any more to point fingers at and now they're
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:14.520]  looking at the Iranians and North Koreans so what when we're talking by the
[03:02:14.520 --> 03:02:21.040]  way of a what's gonna bring the economy down if we have a terrorist strike this
[03:02:21.040 --> 03:02:27.680]  economy goes to zero we go down an economic dark hole that will never be
[03:02:27.680 --> 03:02:34.240]  able to pull out of because go back to 9-11 we were in a recession right after
[03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:42.280]  9-11 Allen the genius Greenspan who admits he's wrong 30% of the time a sea
[03:02:42.280 --> 03:02:49.520]  average he began to lower interest rates to 46 year lows we can't do that any
[03:02:49.520 --> 03:02:55.800]  more to juice the economy if there's a terrorist strike we see an economic
[03:02:55.800 --> 03:03:00.960]  terror that will drive this country into the greatest oppression a lot faster
[03:03:00.960 --> 03:03:05.160]  than we're forecasting but the banks will love that because they're waging war
[03:03:05.160 --> 03:03:08.280]  against Main Street they love things falling apart they get deposed as a
[03:03:08.280 --> 03:03:12.960]  savior and consolidate society all the banks of the banks you know they're
[03:03:12.960 --> 03:03:18.040]  going to make money anyway they can and we don't have to worry about them going
[03:03:18.040 --> 03:03:22.560]  anywhere because when we get into trouble you know we bail them out and
[03:03:22.560 --> 03:03:29.200]  again go back to the quotes of Smedley Butler and and others who know that who
[03:03:29.200 --> 03:03:34.400]  knew the deal and knew what this whole thing is about it's about people making
[03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:38.920]  a lot of money and doing dirty deals and the banks are the ones that wash the
[03:03:38.920 --> 03:03:44.480]  money absolutely and that's why Reuters even admits Russia said okay kill the
[03:03:44.480 --> 03:03:50.360]  poppy fields it's up over 12 12 times what it was nine years ago and the US
[03:03:50.360 --> 03:03:54.120]  and NATO said no we're gonna let them grow and sell the opium I mean it's out
[03:03:54.120 --> 03:03:58.040]  in the open but then cops will raid your house looking for a marijuana cigarette

[03:11:11.960 --> 03:11:15.200]  holding patiently you're on the air with the number one trends forecaster of
[03:11:15.200 --> 03:11:20.280]  trends research dot com Gerald Salente hey Alex and Gerald how y'all we're all
[03:11:20.280 --> 03:11:26.960]  right all right I was wondering about China's involvement in all this I saw
[03:11:26.960 --> 03:11:32.360]  mainstream media yesterday that China was gonna back us up in this whole
[03:11:32.360 --> 03:11:38.080]  Iran business so that kind of makes me nervous yeah how does China play into
[03:11:38.080 --> 03:11:43.000]  the big picture economically militarily everything well China is only going
[03:11:43.000 --> 03:11:46.640]  only going to go so far with Iran because they're doing a lot of business
[03:11:46.640 --> 03:11:52.080]  with them and China's holding all the cards they're holding all our debt so
[03:11:52.080 --> 03:11:57.120]  we really have to play the China game not the other way around and that's what
[03:11:57.120 --> 03:12:01.320]  we're really looking at and all this noise by the way about letting the Yuan
[03:12:01.320 --> 03:12:08.080]  float so that American exports can can be more competitive meaning that it is
[03:12:08.080 --> 03:12:11.880]  going to cost more to buy Chinese products that's only for public
[03:12:11.880 --> 03:12:19.080]  consumption you know China's producing stuff at slave labor wages if they're
[03:12:19.080 --> 03:12:23.280]  if their currency goes up a little bit it's not like everybody's going to be
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:28.840]  buying US products so China is really the ace in the hole over here because if
[03:12:28.840 --> 03:12:36.600]  the other problem with China is last year for example they had 70,000 70,000
[03:12:36.600 --> 03:12:41.760]  major disturbances and riots if the Chinese economy doesn't keep perking
[03:12:41.760 --> 03:12:47.600]  along they have 1.2 billion problems on their hands and let's not forget this
[03:12:47.600 --> 03:12:53.840]  one of the only reasons why this economy didn't crash worse than it has and
[03:12:53.840 --> 03:13:00.440]  quicker than it has is because China has been throwing trillions of dollars into
[03:13:00.440 --> 03:13:05.720]  pumping up their economy and by extension the world economy so now when
[03:13:05.720 --> 03:13:11.560]  China as they're doing now starts to wind back the economy starts to slow up
[03:13:11.560 --> 03:13:15.640]  because we don't have a real economy we have a parasite banking economy of
[03:13:15.640 --> 03:13:20.840]  global banking dictatorship and now we have no more denial about world
[03:13:20.840 --> 03:13:24.280]  government we have Gordon Brown Obama saying we're gonna have a planetary
[03:13:24.280 --> 03:13:29.760]  regime with carbon taxes paid to private banks under a global Constitution
[03:13:29.760 --> 03:13:34.600]  where the banks will be the government I mean this is moving faster than I even
[03:13:34.600 --> 03:13:37.920]  thought it would I don't see how they're gonna get away with this open
[03:13:37.920 --> 03:13:43.120]  tyranny Gerald but they're getting away with it now and again we've said this
[03:13:43.120 --> 03:13:49.280]  over and over again the merger of state and corporate powers is fascism and
[03:13:49.280 --> 03:13:54.800]  what happens when you live under a fascist dictator you don't get out of
[03:13:54.800 --> 03:14:00.400]  line and anything else sorry go ahead no and that's what they're doing now
[03:14:00.400 --> 03:14:06.840]  anything else trip police state for absolutely thank you thank you I
[03:14:06.840 --> 03:14:12.040]  appreciate the call trip Justin West Virginia you're on the air go ahead yeah
[03:14:12.040 --> 03:14:16.960]  hey guys how you doing all right go ahead sir um I was wanting to read a
[03:14:16.960 --> 03:14:20.760]  couple sentences from a story that someone wrote about the health bill and
[03:14:20.760 --> 03:14:24.600]  then I was gonna ask the question to Gerald yeah that's one of my later
[03:14:24.600 --> 03:14:28.480]  questions is the health care bill his analysis of it but but go ahead and
[03:14:28.480 --> 03:14:34.240]  read your your point he put in their insurance companies can no longer drop
[03:14:34.240 --> 03:14:39.160]  clients you become sick giving them lifetime coverage pre-existing medical
[03:14:39.160 --> 03:14:44.560]  conditions people will still be available and at the end he said by
[03:14:44.560 --> 03:14:51.480]  expectancy will be sure to go up and it'll help make the economy better by
[03:14:51.480 --> 03:14:56.520]  having less people file for bankruptcy and my question was is what does Gerald
[03:14:56.520 --> 03:15:01.800]  think about how the health bill is gonna fit in with the crash that he predicts
[03:15:01.800 --> 03:15:06.080]  is coming up Gerald give us your breakdown of the health care bill well
[03:15:06.080 --> 03:15:10.320]  health care bills not gonna accelerate the crash that's a minor player in it
[03:15:10.320 --> 03:15:13.960]  although it's a big one that's a health care bill again another example of
[03:15:13.960 --> 03:15:19.640]  fascism we're being forced to buy insurance from criminal insurance
[03:15:19.640 --> 03:15:24.160]  companies how could you make this stuff up and what is it going to do
[03:15:24.160 --> 03:15:29.520]  perpetuate a failing system look at the condition of the American people what
[03:15:29.520 --> 03:15:33.680]  are we doing we're gonna be dumping more money into a system where by the
[03:15:33.680 --> 03:15:37.280]  people are in very bad shape themselves not taking care of themselves
[03:15:37.280 --> 03:15:42.040]  they're addicted to drugs turn on the television I love it what is this
[03:15:42.040 --> 03:15:47.760]  fibromyalgia one of them I'm watching you know I guess that replaced Epstein
[03:15:47.760 --> 03:15:53.520]  Bard disease they keep making up these things so people become hypochondriacs
[03:15:53.520 --> 03:15:58.720]  and then they have a disclaimer you can't make this stuff up a side effect is
[03:15:58.720 --> 03:16:06.800]  suicide so all this is is a system to keep the people in control to make them
[03:16:06.800 --> 03:16:10.840]  think that they're doing something for them and they're robbing us they're
[03:16:10.840 --> 03:16:17.600]  taxing us to take our money to give it to the insurance companies it again you
[03:16:17.600 --> 03:16:22.160]  could not make this up it's fascism absolutely let me give you my take on
[03:16:22.160 --> 03:16:26.400]  it which mirrors what Gerald is saying and a good good points Justin there's a
[03:16:26.400 --> 03:16:33.440]  war going on of lies and truth and all I have is my honor all I have is that I
[03:16:33.440 --> 03:16:38.960]  sleep well at night I tell the truth I do hardcore research my predictions have
[03:16:38.960 --> 03:16:43.400]  come true Gerald's unfortunately have come true we're political atheists I love
[03:16:43.400 --> 03:16:47.360]  that term he uses I know I'm not a Republican I'm not a Democrat I'm a
[03:16:47.360 --> 03:16:51.720]  freedom lover I'm a truth teller I have read the five different versions of the
[03:16:51.720 --> 03:16:55.360]  bill in the past bill I've scanned over the key sections I've had congressman on
[03:16:55.360 --> 03:16:58.880]  I've read it and then after the fact they admitted it no one's getting free
[03:16:58.880 --> 03:17:04.360]  health care it doesn't cover pre-existing conditions in fact pull up the AP it
[03:17:04.360 --> 03:17:12.840]  says what was the headline of the exact headline it was oversight in bill like it
[03:17:12.840 --> 03:17:17.200]  was a mistake oh didn't give you coverage it makes 30 plus million people buy
[03:17:17.200 --> 03:17:20.840]  coverage it lets the insurance companies lower the standard it allows them to
[03:17:20.840 --> 03:17:27.480]  raise premiums they're saying over 32% right now 39% on average in California
[03:17:27.480 --> 03:17:33.360]  that's AP today I covered it in the first hour 39% it makes you get it you've
[03:17:33.360 --> 03:17:37.160]  seen the VA run health care but this isn't government health care as Ron
[03:17:37.160 --> 03:17:42.200]  Paul said it's corporate health care it's the government though dictating what
[03:17:42.200 --> 03:17:47.320]  doctors can do and what they can't do Gerald Salente oh you hit it you covered
[03:17:47.320 --> 03:17:53.760]  all the points let's take another call here but before there's that other one
[03:17:53.760 --> 03:17:58.480]  too what is that that army of doctors that they're now putting together there
[03:17:58.480 --> 03:18:07.160]  another military wing that's allowed to really become a militia a government
[03:18:07.160 --> 03:18:11.320]  militia of doctors that they're also having that bill and they say federally
[03:18:11.320 --> 03:18:15.520]  they've got to report parents to CPS and ask the kids questions but the point I
[03:18:15.520 --> 03:18:19.920]  forgot to make is it's a war of truth and lies I was watching hardball two
[03:18:19.920 --> 03:18:24.400]  nights ago and everything coming out of Matthews mouth was a lie that's why the
[03:18:24.400 --> 03:18:29.800]  guys got 400,000 viewers folks this radio show conservatively has doubled that
[03:18:29.800 --> 03:18:35.080]  every day this guy's a joke no one is watching Anderson Cooper and no one is
[03:18:35.080 --> 03:18:41.800]  watching these people on CNN MSNBC CNN's lost more than half its ratings in the
[03:18:41.800 --> 03:18:45.400]  last year because people are getting wise to him but Gerald I still can't
[03:18:45.400 --> 03:18:50.760]  believe him saying there's no rationing there's no death panels when it does have
[03:18:50.760 --> 03:18:56.240]  the bioethics panels Tom Dashel said we will cut care to the old people I mean
[03:18:56.240 --> 03:19:00.040]  don't they know the public's gonna find out they're lying I mean it's just such
[03:19:00.040 --> 03:19:05.480]  lying your hacks I mean let's face it look who they represent look where they
[03:19:05.480 --> 03:19:10.080]  come from by the deeds you shall know them you go through the whole list of
[03:19:10.080 --> 03:19:15.120]  these guys these TV tough guys these big mouths and they did just playing to the
[03:19:15.120 --> 03:19:20.520]  crowd and he's you know he's one of the crowd we're gonna come back and take
[03:19:20.520 --> 03:19:23.640]  some more calls but when we come back I first want to ask Gerald Salente because
[03:19:23.640 --> 03:19:28.400]  I'm interested in his take Time Magazine Newsweek I'll ask the question now we'll

[03:19:42.840 --> 03:19:48.040]  singling me out more really than anybody else now on a daily basis what is
[03:19:48.040 --> 03:19:51.920]  Gerald think that is really all about because I really want to get his take
[03:19:51.920 --> 03:19:56.080]  on it and I want to ask him if he's had any threats or demonization out there as

[03:24:20.360 --> 03:24:25.280]  interview we've got about 35 minutes left with him today top trends forecaster
[03:24:25.280 --> 03:24:28.960]  Gerald again I'm selfishly asking you the question but also it lets us
[03:24:28.960 --> 03:24:32.560]  understand politically what they're concerned about I'm not in the left
[03:24:32.560 --> 03:24:36.360]  right paradigm I'm a political atheist like yourself I'm a constitutionalist
[03:24:36.360 --> 03:24:40.880]  they're trying to demonize the Tea Party anybody that criticizes the banks three
[03:24:40.880 --> 03:24:44.640]  years ago you predicted there'd be these grassroots protests and rebellions
[03:24:44.640 --> 03:24:48.920]  against taxation against the banks that's now unfolding why do you think
[03:24:48.920 --> 03:24:53.520]  they're singling me out particularly I mean if a cop gets shot they say it's my
[03:24:53.520 --> 03:24:57.280]  fault with no evidence why do you think we're a year into this program of
[03:24:57.280 --> 03:25:01.520]  demonization because you're making a difference and you're waking people up
[03:25:01.520 --> 03:25:06.400]  and you're speaking to what a lot of people feel and they don't want that to
[03:25:06.400 --> 03:25:12.240]  happen so it's it's it's logical that they would do that they wanted they want
[03:25:12.240 --> 03:25:17.320]  to stop the force that has the most power and it's you know it's like cutting
[03:25:17.320 --> 03:25:21.320]  off the head of the snake they they feel as though if they can stop you they
[03:25:21.320 --> 03:25:25.560]  could stop the movement in a lot of ways because you're at the forefront of it
[03:25:25.560 --> 03:25:30.080]  and they're going to continue to do it and demonize everybody and that they
[03:25:30.080 --> 03:25:35.960]  can that exposes the fraud going on I remember talking about what was going
[03:25:35.960 --> 03:25:42.600]  on about how this this DC ice we called it Wall Street hijacks Washington how
[03:25:42.600 --> 03:25:46.720]  when we first said that we were it was considered outrageous that we would
[03:25:46.720 --> 03:25:52.040]  think that so anytime that you begin to expose the fraud the criminality and the
[03:25:52.040 --> 03:25:56.480]  corruption they want to shut you down because you cost them a lot of money
[03:25:56.480 --> 03:26:02.440]  and a lot of problems but why would all these major TV networks and publications
[03:26:02.440 --> 03:26:06.480]  say I'm calling for violence and Fox admitted in a news article too they
[03:26:06.480 --> 03:26:09.360]  wrote they called Homeland Security on us I don't know if you knew this two
[03:26:09.360 --> 03:26:13.680]  weeks ago off comments on the message board implying that they were ours then
[03:26:13.680 --> 03:26:17.920]  we found far worse comments on Fox Nation's own website their own pundits
[03:26:17.920 --> 03:26:21.520]  even saying more do you think they're getting ready to set me up or is this
[03:26:21.520 --> 03:26:25.240]  just to demonize me I mean because it looks like you're trying to sick the
[03:26:25.240 --> 03:26:29.440]  cops and the IRS on me well they're probably well aware of that already and
[03:26:29.440 --> 03:26:33.720]  they're just gonna look for any kind of breach that they could give an excuse to
[03:26:33.720 --> 03:26:39.320]  come in with just like they do with everyone else so it's again you know
[03:26:39.320 --> 03:26:43.600]  you said it before you know you the only thing you have in this life is your
[03:26:43.600 --> 03:26:48.760]  word and you're dignity and that's all you leave behind is your word so of
[03:26:48.760 --> 03:26:55.480]  course there's always the threat I mean I I have to tell you back in 2002 in the
[03:26:55.480 --> 03:27:00.880]  trends journal in my column I wrote it's getting dangerous and I said that
[03:27:00.880 --> 03:27:05.000]  I'm going to be careful what I say because when they come out from the
[03:27:05.000 --> 03:27:10.040]  government saying and you remember during the Bush years you're either with us or
[03:27:10.040 --> 03:27:14.760]  against us and you have to be careful what you say and we're entering into a
[03:27:14.760 --> 03:27:19.800]  period like that and I make this really clear I'm not willing to die for my
[03:27:19.800 --> 03:27:25.320]  country because what is my country my country certainly isn't the Democrats of
[03:27:25.320 --> 03:27:30.960]  the Republicans so what do you when do you know you know when do you say hey
[03:27:30.960 --> 03:27:35.400]  listen you know do knock yourself out do what you want to do but I'm not gonna
[03:27:35.400 --> 03:27:40.520]  take shots for anybody I make that really clear and I make it very clear that
[03:27:40.520 --> 03:27:44.560]  we're calling for an intellectual revolution so what I would suggest you
[03:27:44.560 --> 03:27:51.160]  continue to do every chance you can is to say we want a peaceful change and what
[03:27:51.160 --> 03:27:57.440]  and you see is that we is what's going on Alex the more they lose control the
[03:27:57.440 --> 03:28:01.840]  harder they're gonna clamp down and this is what the people need to know and
[03:28:01.840 --> 03:28:06.960]  that's why we're saying the more that they start losing the more control that
[03:28:06.960 --> 03:28:12.440]  slips away they're going to create a violent situation so they could crack
[03:28:12.440 --> 03:28:17.200]  down on it and do you agree that they're clearly trying to provocateur well
[03:28:17.200 --> 03:28:21.160]  they've been caught violence and that they want to they wanted to get violent
[03:28:21.160 --> 03:28:26.360]  I don't know if they want to but I know that nothing I read my lips no new
[03:28:26.360 --> 03:28:30.680]  taxes I didn't have sex with that woman Monica Lewinsky I smoked but I didn't
[03:28:30.680 --> 03:28:35.560]  inhale Saddam Hussein has weapons of mass destruction I'm no crook how can
[03:28:35.560 --> 03:28:40.680]  anybody believe anything they say remember the main the Gulf of Tonkin
[03:28:40.680 --> 03:28:47.400]  one lie built after another these are psychopaths and sociopaths look at this
[03:28:47.400 --> 03:28:54.000]  kindness this what was Edwards John Edwards whiter than white you know
[03:28:54.000 --> 03:28:59.080]  talking about morality and he gets caught with a chick I mean Spitzer I
[03:28:59.080 --> 03:29:05.000]  talked about one after another look up the definition of a sociopath
[03:29:05.000 --> 03:29:11.280]  this is who they are and this is the way they behave they will do anything to
[03:29:11.280 --> 03:29:18.200]  maintain their control they act with all of the respectability and dignity on the
[03:29:18.200 --> 03:29:23.440]  teller on on in front of the folks and in behind the scenes they're doing their
[03:29:23.440 --> 03:29:27.880]  dirty little stuff and again and they're not even man enough to admit it
[03:29:27.880 --> 03:29:33.240]  whoever made up this stuff as soon as you get caught having sex your promise
[03:29:33.240 --> 03:29:42.800]  you're gonna go the sex addiction therapy when did they make this yeah well
[03:29:42.800 --> 03:29:47.200]  and exactly the media makes it a big deal about sex with women as they still

[03:33:12.440 --> 03:33:18.840]  be continuing with your phone calls for Gerald Salente and I've got some other
[03:33:18.840 --> 03:33:23.000]  questions I want to ask him in some Twitter questions as well let's go
[03:33:23.000 --> 03:33:26.760]  ahead and talk to Ron in Texas Ron you're on the air go ahead
[03:33:26.760 --> 03:33:31.240]  now it's always a pleasure mr. swimming page is a complete honor I got two
[03:33:31.240 --> 03:33:37.880]  questions actually one there was a 2005 PNAC report by Gary Schmidt that
[03:33:37.880 --> 03:33:43.680]  started off saying that Iran's nuclear capability was about 10 years behind so
[03:33:43.680 --> 03:33:50.160]  my first question is what do you see in your professional opinion as a reality
[03:33:50.160 --> 03:33:59.240]  of their capability the other one is some time ago we had a warhead that was
[03:33:59.240 --> 03:34:05.960]  known as the whiskey 54 which was nicknamed a baby Crockett and a special
[03:34:05.960 --> 03:34:11.480]  comics demolition munition that was man portable a reason why I'm stating this
[03:34:11.480 --> 03:34:17.080]  is this yielded somewhere between 1 and 10 kilotons so would you say that they
[03:34:17.080 --> 03:34:22.480]  wouldn't go more if they played this card go more route of a kiloton yield or
[03:34:22.480 --> 03:34:29.760]  things how the megatons would be too destructive and kind of I guess be
[03:34:29.760 --> 03:34:33.760]  worthless to what they wanted to end up with all right thank you Ron let's get
[03:34:33.760 --> 03:34:38.440]  Gerald Salente's take on that question we believe that Iran is eventually going
[03:34:38.440 --> 03:34:42.320]  to have nuclear weapons I guess you could bring it down to the right to bear
[03:34:42.320 --> 03:34:48.240]  arms they're in a very hostile region they have hostile neighbors and and it's
[03:34:48.240 --> 03:34:53.560]  probably going to be for defensive purposes look India has them Pakistan has
[03:34:53.560 --> 03:34:58.760]  them both of them have not signed a nuclear proliferation treaty as has
[03:34:58.760 --> 03:35:03.360]  Israel hasn't signed it either so we believe at some point they're going to
[03:35:03.360 --> 03:35:09.000]  get it to use it as a whole nother thing it's like being armed and not going to
[03:35:09.000 --> 03:35:14.800]  war as to the defensive purposes and we would say it logically we believe that
[03:35:14.800 --> 03:35:19.960]  Iran is going to move to a nuclear and there's no stopping them and again on
[03:35:19.960 --> 03:35:26.440]  the one province do you do that when does the hypocrisy stop why can the UK
[03:35:26.440 --> 03:35:32.800]  why can France why can India why can China why can Israel and why can the
[03:35:32.800 --> 03:35:38.120]  United States have nuclear weapons and Russia and not Iran well look at North
[03:35:38.120 --> 03:35:42.840]  Korea as soon as you get it if you get left alone yeah I mean you know are they
[03:35:42.840 --> 03:35:46.440]  going to use them if they use them they're going to suffer the consequences
[03:35:46.440 --> 03:35:50.280]  are they going to use them against Russia and China they'll get wiped out like a
[03:35:50.280 --> 03:35:56.120]  net even if they use them against Israel the firepower coming back would be
[03:35:56.120 --> 03:36:01.280]  multiples way beyond so and then again who in their right mind would use a
[03:36:01.280 --> 03:36:05.400]  nuclear weapon well then they say oh they're crazy Muslims but but but I mean
[03:36:05.400 --> 03:36:09.640]  looking at that Iran's nuclear program is public the centrifuges won't make the
[03:36:09.640 --> 03:36:13.040]  uranium they need they've been offered to have France make it so everybody knew
[03:36:13.040 --> 03:36:18.240]  that it wasn't able to do that I mean I I mean Venezuela wants nuclear reactors
[03:36:18.240 --> 03:36:23.160]  now they are having power outages I mean South Africa's got nukes our government
[03:36:23.160 --> 03:36:29.160]  is overthrown Iran twice I mean it's just incredible I know and that's what
[03:36:29.160 --> 03:36:34.200]  we're saying but what they're doing is they're using Iran as the symbol for
[03:36:34.200 --> 03:36:39.920]  people to hate and once you get the people to hate then they can prosecute
[03:36:39.920 --> 03:36:43.680]  their war and they won't hate the bankers now that is a real problem of
[03:36:43.680 --> 03:36:47.520]  course the bankers will be forgotten because that's what we were saying in
[03:36:47.520 --> 03:36:52.920]  the beginning this is the same scenario different names different places it's
[03:36:52.920 --> 03:37:00.440]  1929 it's it's the Great Depression and it's World War two well it's the panic
[03:37:00.440 --> 03:37:05.320]  of 08 we're gonna go into the Great Depression we're already in it look
[03:37:05.320 --> 03:37:09.120]  how many people have it don't have jobs you know the numbers what's the effect
[03:37:09.120 --> 03:37:14.320]  of unemployment rate around 20% you know so and now they're gonna the way
[03:37:14.320 --> 03:37:17.920]  they're going to get us out of it when all their other schemes fail is they're
[03:37:17.920 --> 03:37:23.480]  going to take us to war they're taking us to war in Pakistan look what's going
[03:37:23.480 --> 03:37:28.800]  on over there we're in Pakistan we're in a we're enough we're in Afghanistan we're
[03:37:28.800 --> 03:37:35.880]  in Iraq and we're going to go we're fearful of fighting a war with Iran
[03:37:35.880 --> 03:37:40.080]  absolutely let's go ahead and talk to Scott in Texas you're on the air then
[03:37:40.080 --> 03:37:47.280]  Pamela Jim Paul and others hi Gerald Alex hi Gerald I've got two questions for
[03:37:47.280 --> 03:37:53.840]  you today one to do with the coming war the yellow predicting and the the other
[03:37:53.840 --> 03:38:00.040]  one is trying to forecast exactly when the collapse will happen yeah again the
[03:38:00.040 --> 03:38:04.840]  collapsing timings it's very difficult for the timing because they come up with
[03:38:04.840 --> 03:38:08.640]  screen schemes untrained up what you're saying as early as September of this
[03:38:08.640 --> 03:38:13.320]  year we believe that we can have it by September because again they will who
[03:38:13.320 --> 03:38:15.840]  would have thought we would have been bailing out banks and buying up
[03:38:15.840 --> 03:38:19.880]  companies so it should have gone down and then they do all these things behind
[03:38:19.880 --> 03:38:23.480]  his scenes that we don't know about but we believe by and then the other issue
[03:38:23.480 --> 03:38:30.320]  I'm sorry the other question was war war you see that happening again you know
[03:38:30.320 --> 03:38:34.640]  that the timing is very difficult but we believe it's it's it's going to be sooner
[03:38:34.640 --> 03:38:38.760]  rather than later and it's going to be steps into the great war they're not
[03:38:38.760 --> 03:38:45.600]  gonna be one day but it can be one day if there is a 9-11 magnitude terrorist
[03:38:45.600 --> 03:38:49.360]  strike which we believe is going to happen so you have all these different
[03:38:49.360 --> 03:38:54.280]  factors going on at one time which one's going to be the tripping point it's
[03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:58.240]  very difficult to say at this point
[03:38:59.560 --> 03:39:04.360]  Scott does that answer your question I just want to ask one quick thing about
[03:39:04.360 --> 03:39:12.560]  the war part Hugh court has a website where he calls that the bin Laden has
[03:39:12.560 --> 03:39:18.120]  plans for an American Hiroshima I wonder if Gerald is familiar with what's
[03:39:18.120 --> 03:39:23.040]  available through Dr. Court and if he would have in the you know does he put
[03:39:23.040 --> 03:39:27.240]  much credibility into that you know I've been here from bin Laden out for how
[03:39:27.240 --> 03:39:31.520]  many years you know and and and I don't think he has the wherewithal even if
[03:39:31.520 --> 03:39:36.360]  he's even there there is a bin Laden anymore Scott I appreciate your call
[03:39:36.360 --> 03:39:40.880]  let me comment on that look we know Alcatel was created by the CIA we know
[03:39:40.880 --> 03:39:45.880]  bin Laden was CIA we know that every week or two there's a new article quoting
[03:39:45.880 --> 03:39:50.040]  him from some message board or audio and at the bottom it says we don't know
[03:39:50.040 --> 03:39:54.200]  this is him or not this is a boogeyman a goldstein somebody to scare the
[03:39:54.200 --> 03:39:58.360]  population here's the Washington Times critics Obama administration hyping
[03:39:58.360 --> 03:40:03.240]  terrorist nuclear risk the Obama administration is warning the danger of
[03:40:03.240 --> 03:40:07.400]  a terror attack within the United States the nuclear weapon is increasing but
[03:40:07.400 --> 03:40:12.200]  US officials say the claim is not based on new intelligence and questioned
[03:40:12.200 --> 03:40:16.480]  whether the threat is being overstated and President Obama went on in the 47
[03:40:16.480 --> 03:40:20.480]  you know nation nuclear summit they were having to conclude that the risk of
[03:40:20.480 --> 03:40:25.840]  nuclear confrontation has gone down between nations but the risk of nuclear
[03:40:25.840 --> 03:40:30.760]  attack from terrorist has gone up I mean this and then it's got all these top
[03:40:30.760 --> 03:40:35.720]  analysts saying this is political hype and fear-mongering and Obama's trying to
[03:40:35.720 --> 03:40:41.360]  blame it on Iran when Iran is Shiite the arch enemy of the Saudi Arabian Al Qaeda
[03:40:41.360 --> 03:40:47.160]  Wahhabi is comments on that Gerald you've covered it it is hype and and it
[03:40:47.160 --> 03:40:52.680]  could happen by the way you know when I wrote trends 2000 back in 1996 we
[03:40:52.680 --> 03:40:57.120]  front-loaded it with the breakup of the former Soviet Union and all of the
[03:40:57.120 --> 03:41:01.600]  suitcase size nukes and other nuclear materials that were being sold on the
[03:41:01.600 --> 03:41:06.560]  black market so again it with the foreign policy going in the direction it's
[03:41:06.560 --> 03:41:11.040]  going in of course there's going to be major reprisals against the United
[03:41:11.040 --> 03:41:15.640]  States anybody that thinks differently is out of their mind you can't invade
[03:41:15.640 --> 03:41:20.200]  other countries occupy him kill hundreds of thousands of people and not want
[03:41:20.200 --> 03:41:25.880]  people to get even with you how they do it whether it's nuclear a biological
[03:41:25.880 --> 03:41:30.800]  attack whether it's a you know whatever it might be in a stadium in a shopping
[03:41:30.800 --> 03:41:36.320]  mall it's going to happen Gerald what I'm saying is it is in this inverted
[03:41:36.320 --> 03:41:42.080]  logic terrorism will help the new world order it will help the fascist the
[03:41:42.080 --> 03:41:46.640]  corporatist because the public doesn't understand we're attacking other people
[03:41:46.640 --> 03:41:51.360]  you know if a cop breaks his baton on your head he charges you this what
[03:41:51.360 --> 03:41:55.560]  literally happens with assaulting him now there's a big federal case of course
[03:41:55.560 --> 03:42:02.320]  with Maryland University over this right now and so it really helps the
[03:42:02.320 --> 03:42:07.040]  establishment to stage terror attacks as a pretext to launch these new wars
[03:42:07.040 --> 03:42:14.840]  Alex you know you don't need any clearer proof than Afghanistan and Iraq Iraq is
[03:42:14.840 --> 03:42:21.000]  a war being fought under false pretenses there was no weapons of mass
[03:42:21.000 --> 03:42:27.040]  destruction there was no ties to al Qaeda and go back and look at what the
[03:42:27.040 --> 03:42:35.040]  reasoning was to attack Afghanistan it was to get Osama bin Laden and close
[03:42:35.040 --> 03:42:41.680]  down the terrorist camps so they're going to use anything they can fake or
[03:42:41.680 --> 03:42:48.360]  real to keep the military machine going and to keep the people under their
[03:42:48.360 --> 03:42:53.920]  thumb in the height of fear and as you mentioned they're using the fear card
[03:42:53.920 --> 03:43:00.720]  again and they're playing the card as a trial balloon because there's going to
[03:43:00.720 --> 03:43:06.480]  be real reasons for fear coming down the road okay I want to go back to calls
[03:43:06.480 --> 03:43:10.680]  but I wanted to bring another subject back in January of last year a year and
[03:43:10.680 --> 03:43:17.200]  a half ago or almost a year and a half ago we got state of New York bureau of
[03:43:17.200 --> 03:43:21.920]  cemeteries internal documents we had emergency managers on saying they're
[03:43:21.920 --> 03:43:25.360]  preparing an Indiana and Illinois for millions of dead that the flu was coming
[03:43:25.360 --> 03:43:28.640]  it was going to kill millions and that the feds had to take over and have
[03:43:28.640 --> 03:43:33.080]  martial law we got the documents I warned the people then in April out of the
[03:43:33.080 --> 03:43:39.320]  wrong season wrong hemisphere H1N1 pops up I go on air and I say I don't know
[03:43:39.320 --> 03:43:43.240]  if this is going to be real or not whether it's real flu or not it's
[03:43:43.240 --> 03:43:46.200]  psychological terrorism just like if it's a real nuke attack or not it's
[03:43:46.200 --> 03:43:51.480]  psychological terrorism then the head of the EU Health Commission 47 member group
[03:43:51.480 --> 03:43:56.200]  Wolfgang Woodrig we had him on documented that they paid off the
[03:43:56.200 --> 03:44:01.120]  scientists in our governments had them lie to make tens of billions on sales
[03:44:01.120 --> 03:44:05.640]  you talked about it being a fraud I talked about it here it is the daily
[03:44:05.640 --> 03:44:10.800]  mail we blundered over swine flu admit health chiefs global health chiefs have
[03:44:10.800 --> 03:44:14.520]  finally admitted that they may have overreacted to swine flu pandemic landing
[03:44:14.520 --> 03:44:18.080]  governments with millions of unused vaccines that's the whitewash but there
[03:44:18.080 --> 03:44:23.200]  we are again right about the fact that H1N1 was a hoax but that it was
[03:44:23.200 --> 03:44:27.320]  genetically engineered that's been confirmed and that if you took the
[03:44:27.320 --> 03:44:32.000]  seasonal flu shot that's what gave you the H1N1 they were putting it in the
[03:44:32.000 --> 03:44:36.040]  vaccines that's in five new studies that they were actually I mean this is so
[03:44:36.040 --> 03:44:40.360]  diabolical it's right out in the open and nobody gets in trouble well look
[03:44:40.360 --> 03:44:45.400]  what's going on with the pharmaceutical companies they hired doctors and they
[03:44:45.400 --> 03:44:50.520]  they pay the doctors to do the research and then the doctors become spokespersons
[03:44:50.520 --> 03:44:54.920]  for the pharmaceutical industry and they make up fake studies I mean how much
[03:44:54.920 --> 03:44:59.560]  more proof do you need hey ladies remember all of that estrogen they told
[03:44:59.560 --> 03:45:04.520]  you to take for how many years and then with the people that was saying that it
[03:45:04.520 --> 03:45:08.400]  was dangerous for you and it wasn't doing the things that they claimed it was
[03:45:08.400 --> 03:45:14.560]  doing they would they would you know run them into the ground so yes it's every
[03:45:14.560 --> 03:45:19.240]  level and again keep making the connections you know it's the same thing
[03:45:19.240 --> 03:45:26.000]  it's the pharmaceutical companies it's big agriculture it's big banks and it's
[03:45:26.000 --> 03:45:32.320]  the Great War it all ends up it all goes into the same direction World War two
[03:45:32.320 --> 03:45:38.960]  World War one and the war coming up it's a war of profits they'll kill anybody
[03:45:38.960 --> 03:45:44.840]  they'll do anything as I said before there's nothing more than money junk okay
[03:45:44.840 --> 03:45:48.280]  Gerald Solente I want to race through calls and questions down the last 12
[03:45:48.280 --> 03:45:53.760]  14 minutes we have left here the revolt of the states there that's a Twitter
[03:45:53.760 --> 03:45:58.640]  question states moving to sue states talking about secession even Rick Perry
[03:45:58.640 --> 03:46:02.600]  talking about it declaring 10th amendment where do you see that going
[03:46:02.600 --> 03:46:07.760]  oh definitely we wrote about this years ago secessionism is a real movement we
[03:46:07.760 --> 03:46:11.080]  can see the former we could see the United States breaking up like the
[03:46:11.080 --> 03:46:15.760]  former Soviet Union the second Vermont Republic check that one out there real
[03:46:15.760 --> 03:46:20.400]  this is for real and these are really intelligent guys Thomas Naylor I mean
[03:46:20.400 --> 03:46:23.880]  this guy's you know professor Meredith from Duke University there there are a
[03:46:23.880 --> 03:46:28.760]  lot of intelligent people we can see it breaking up as the government grips more
[03:46:28.760 --> 03:46:33.840]  the states break apart here's another question a Twitter question from
[03:46:33.840 --> 03:46:39.360]  Fedros it says the Australian economy seems to follow the U.S. closely should
[03:46:39.360 --> 03:46:45.080]  the U.S. economy implode what chance have we here in Oz they won't get hit as
[03:46:45.080 --> 03:46:49.720]  bad but they'll get everybody there will be very few countries that escape that
[03:46:49.720 --> 03:46:54.000]  that escape it that's the best countries that we're looking at and they're in
[03:46:54.000 --> 03:46:59.160]  this trends journal is Australia Canada Norway New Zealand those about the top
[03:46:59.160 --> 03:47:03.120]  and of course Switzerland they're the money cockroaches of the world they
[03:47:03.120 --> 03:47:07.280]  never go anywhere but they won't get hit as bad as the United States because the
[03:47:07.280 --> 03:47:12.600]  country they're not as indebted as we are what do you think about state bank
[03:47:12.600 --> 03:47:17.920]  initiatives where we have state banks that give the public free credit like I
[03:47:17.920 --> 03:47:21.800]  don't think you give free credit at all and but what we should go back to we
[03:47:21.800 --> 03:47:26.640]  believe is the Glass-Steagall Act it worked before it saved us after the
[03:47:26.640 --> 03:47:30.320]  Great Depression so the criminals couldn't do what they're doing now and
[03:47:30.320 --> 03:47:35.240]  by the way in it when I the things that I do personally I put all my money most
[03:47:35.240 --> 03:47:40.760]  of our money in the in the community bank in the local bank I know it's sound
[03:47:40.760 --> 03:47:44.640]  and I also of course it would because we're an international business we have
[03:47:44.640 --> 03:47:49.880]  to have international banks but but they can't loan for free I mean it is
[03:47:49.880 --> 03:47:56.720]  can't it can't work like that what do you see with the the population and the
[03:47:56.720 --> 03:48:00.000]  relationship with police now because of all these tiny handheld cameras
[03:48:00.000 --> 03:48:05.920]  built into cell phones iPads you name it iPhones we're really seeing police walk
[03:48:05.920 --> 03:48:10.320]  up beat innocent people have to death throw legless men out of wheelchairs
[03:48:10.320 --> 03:48:14.800]  going crazy and being encouraged to do it and now the public's really getting
[03:48:14.800 --> 03:48:18.080]  to see this where do you see that going and where do you see the attempt to
[03:48:18.080 --> 03:48:22.160]  clamp down on free speech on the internet going well we're going to well
[03:48:22.160 --> 03:48:26.280]  they're gonna be they are clamping down on free speech they're gonna continue to
[03:48:26.280 --> 03:48:31.880]  clamp down we just saw that that that federal court ruling that was in favor
[03:48:31.880 --> 03:48:40.120]  of a Comcast where they can now charge different prices for different clients to
[03:48:40.120 --> 03:48:43.920]  give them different speeds that may come about in the future so net
[03:48:43.920 --> 03:48:48.960]  neutrality is really under attack as far as the police the police are becoming
[03:48:48.960 --> 03:48:53.520]  like goon squads for the bankers and it's just when that's what happens when a
[03:48:53.520 --> 03:49:00.000]  nation goes from first class to third world they beat you into submission and
[03:49:00.000 --> 03:49:05.400]  that's what's going on in the United States more and more let's jam in a
[03:49:05.400 --> 03:49:10.440]  phone call here up next is Pamela in Wisconsin and Jim Paul and Chuck will
[03:49:10.440 --> 03:49:13.760]  least get to those Jim go ahead
[03:49:15.400 --> 03:49:21.080]  hey Jim we're on the air how you doing buddy they go to Paul in Tennessee go
[03:49:21.080 --> 03:49:27.800]  ahead Paul you're on the air there you there yes sir go ahead I hear you
[03:49:27.800 --> 03:49:34.560]  people talking all the time about God gold and guns my question is this now the
[03:49:34.560 --> 03:49:40.160]  thing is okay buying gold would be a wise investment but my question is if these
[03:49:40.160 --> 03:49:43.960]  people have this gold and the dollar is only worth as far as I know maybe four
[03:49:43.960 --> 03:49:50.000]  cents why would they sell their gold for a dollar well you know no no no you won't
[03:49:50.000 --> 03:49:53.840]  there'll be inflation of the dollar so instead of getting a thousand dollars
[03:49:53.840 --> 03:49:57.560]  an ounce you might get $3,000 an ounce so your gold when you sell it would
[03:49:57.560 --> 03:50:02.040]  convert to whatever the currency was at that time thus protecting you from
[03:50:02.040 --> 03:50:06.560]  inflation Gerald Salenty you said it that's it that's it and by the way my
[03:50:06.560 --> 03:50:11.840]  strategy is personally I'm I'm a heavily invested in gold and have been for
[03:50:11.840 --> 03:50:18.160]  years I also buy Swiss francs Canadian dollars and US dollars because what in
[03:50:18.160 --> 03:50:24.520]  that play all I want to do is to stay even and gold is my wild card because I
[03:50:24.520 --> 03:50:29.240]  believe that they're going to devalue the dollar rather than it inflating in one
[03:50:29.240 --> 03:50:32.960]  way or another it's not going to be worth it won't be able to buy a candy
[03:50:32.960 --> 03:50:37.360]  and gold is up almost 400% in the last 10 years so that was a good bet for you
[03:50:37.360 --> 03:50:43.920]  well yeah and I can we believe it's gonna hit 2000 and beyond Cindy Chuck and
[03:50:43.920 --> 03:50:50.200]  Eric you are straight ahead final callers for Gerald Salenty and we'll give
[03:50:50.200 --> 03:50:54.120]  you his website as well on the other side you can see it up on the screen if
[03:50:54.120 --> 03:50:58.760]  you're watching at presentplanet.tv it's trendsresearch.com final segment
[03:50:58.760 --> 03:51:01.160]  straight ahead
[03:51:02.880 --> 03:51:08.200]  remain in your houses the president of the United States has declared martial law

[03:54:41.280 --> 03:54:45.600]  Chuck in Vegas you're on the air go ahead hi Alex nice to speak to you I
[03:54:45.600 --> 03:54:50.240]  wanted to quickly just say I've been listening to your show for a little
[03:54:50.240 --> 03:54:54.920]  more than a year now it was a a breath of fresh air to be able to get the
[03:54:54.920 --> 03:55:00.400]  information that you have it's something that I've been inquisitive about for
[03:55:00.400 --> 03:55:05.840]  for years and you did you you were speaking vaguely about the you know
[03:55:05.840 --> 03:55:10.160]  the recent flu epidemic that we've been having but you know things were
[03:55:10.160 --> 03:55:13.200]  suspect even as far back as SARS you know what I mean when all these things
[03:55:13.200 --> 03:55:17.360]  in the third flu virus and all these things would just pop up and then go
[03:55:17.360 --> 03:55:23.000]  away without any they use the environment they use bugs they use war all
[03:55:23.000 --> 03:55:27.880]  as a pretext to take control of our lives yeah and but my my main comment is
[03:55:27.880 --> 03:55:33.600]  now my facebook page is nothing no no BS it's nothing but informative
[03:55:33.600 --> 03:55:37.600]  information I either get a link from you or other the drug report other other
[03:55:37.600 --> 03:55:43.040]  rules out of time go ahead okay my things what do we do to to wake people up like
[03:55:43.040 --> 03:55:46.320]  even even in my own household I speak to my wife about the stuff when I could
[03:55:46.320 --> 03:55:51.320]  engage her shortly but her span I mean she's more concerned about Jesse James
[03:55:51.320 --> 03:55:55.960]  and and and that's Chuck Chuck Chuck there's some people love them to death
[03:55:55.960 --> 03:56:00.840]  aren't ever concerned it's like in the Godfather they say you know women and
[03:56:00.840 --> 03:56:04.920]  children can be careless men cannot be careless and a lot of men act like
[03:56:04.920 --> 03:56:08.440]  women and a lot of women act like men but let's talk to Gerald Salente about
[03:56:08.440 --> 03:56:13.320]  that I would move on to people that do want to be warned 5% started this
[03:56:13.320 --> 03:56:17.360]  country Gerald Salente that's it there's about 20% could change the whole
[03:56:17.360 --> 03:56:21.400]  country and we believe there's 20% that'll move there's a great quote
[03:56:21.400 --> 03:56:26.600]  attributed to Jesus Christ I can heal the sick I can make the blind see in the
[03:56:26.600 --> 03:56:33.040]  lame walk I can even raise the dead but I not even I can save a fool from their
[03:56:33.040 --> 03:56:38.400]  foolishness absolutely so just move on Chuck I mean try to educate your wife
[03:56:38.400 --> 03:56:43.040]  as things get worse she'll listen to you later Eric in North Carolina you're on
[03:56:43.040 --> 03:56:46.840]  the air quick question for Gerald yeah thanks a lot listen real quick is that
[03:56:46.840 --> 03:56:52.600]  central point behind all these scams and frauds and and tricks is the complicit
[03:56:52.600 --> 03:56:56.880]  media why aren't they the central target of our effort because without the corrupt
[03:56:56.880 --> 03:57:00.800]  media so many people wouldn't be fooled well the media is all losing their
[03:57:00.800 --> 03:57:03.920]  viewers and falling apart so they want to shut down our free space was a kick in
[03:57:03.920 --> 03:57:08.240]  their butt Gerald that's it the biggest trend that we're writing about is going
[03:57:08.240 --> 03:57:14.000]  to be internet TV everything you see on that little screen now goes to the big
[03:57:14.000 --> 03:57:18.480]  screen and they really fearful of that because they can't keep up and compare
[03:57:18.480 --> 03:57:25.040]  with the content coming from an Alex Jones you're not gonna see that on CNN so
[03:57:25.040 --> 03:57:28.920]  that's the real fear and that's why they're going to clamp down on the media
[03:57:28.920 --> 03:57:33.600]  in the future well here's an example I mean Gerald Salentes on Fox CNN you name
[03:57:33.600 --> 03:57:39.560]  it but here you get to hear in depth two hours I mean and here he can really
[03:57:39.560 --> 03:57:43.640]  you know break things down into tail thank you Eric real quick Brad in
[03:57:43.640 --> 03:57:50.320]  California go ahead I've got some property in Argentina actually I was
[03:57:50.320 --> 03:57:53.640]  wondering if you think that's a good safe country to be in if when all this
[03:57:53.640 --> 03:57:57.600]  stuff goes absolutely not we'll get Gerald's opinion run by the bankers
[03:57:57.600 --> 03:58:01.280]  they're grabbing your pension funds right now Gerald I just got back from
[03:58:01.280 --> 03:58:05.120]  Argentina coming in from Chile of course yeah I don't know if you know I was there
[03:58:05.120 --> 03:58:10.760]  during the earthquake and you know when we came over all of a sudden a couple of
[03:58:10.760 --> 03:58:16.400]  times you they had these roadblocks with helicopters and guys dressed with
[03:58:16.400 --> 03:58:20.600]  enough body armor to go through the Battle of the Bulge now it's a place
[03:58:20.600 --> 03:58:25.840]  that's on the edge but I but I would say also that you know I wouldn't buy
