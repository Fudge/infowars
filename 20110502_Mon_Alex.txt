[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:33.360]  my friends you are not going to hear us playing a theme song from Team America
[00:33.360 --> 00:42.840]  America oh yeah or I'm proud to be an American or at least I know I'm free to
[00:42.840 --> 00:46.640]  have the TSA stick their hands down my pants and the foreign private Federal

[00:52.480 --> 00:57.080]  somebody who is skin deep when it comes to loving liberty and freedom in the
[00:57.080 --> 01:02.240]  Republic I understand that the globalists that dress in our own garb and
[01:02.240 --> 01:08.040]  speak in our dialect are the traders within as Cicero said the trader is the
[01:08.040 --> 01:15.160]  plague because he doesn't come openly with his banner unfurled and that's
[01:15.160 --> 01:19.840]  what's happening here the globalists have created al Qaeda on record they have
[01:19.840 --> 01:24.040]  launched al Qaeda attacks all over the world or carried out attacks and blamed
[01:24.040 --> 01:30.200]  it on their assets and now because Obama's approval rating is plunging the
[01:30.200 --> 01:34.360]  dollar is plunging the support for the wars is flagging they have rolled
[01:34.360 --> 01:39.720]  literally out of the deep freeze Osama bin Laden if they claim they killed nine
[01:39.720 --> 01:44.600]  other times but this is the big announcement they have rolled him out
[01:44.600 --> 01:47.840]  of the deep freeze and claim that they killed him in the middle of a populated
[01:47.840 --> 01:55.200]  area in Pakistan and now the talk is we got to hit them Pakistan people they're
[01:55.200 --> 02:01.400]  the ones I reckon that done it mm-hmm after we kill them Pakistani people then

[03:26.240 --> 03:32.720]  saves this Republic it's going to be the cold hard facts just so happens did
[03:32.720 --> 03:37.800]  everybody forget I interviewed Henry Kissinger's right-hand man from the
[03:37.800 --> 03:45.240]  State Department in 2002 he writes books with Tom Clancy now his name's Steve
[03:45.240 --> 03:51.600]  Pachennick and he worked with Osama bin Laden and he said on this show he was
[03:51.600 --> 03:57.640]  dead and they had him on ice and then after he did that interview you called
[03:57.640 --> 04:01.680]  me up and said please take it down I'm getting so much heat from the CFR they
[04:01.680 --> 04:06.720]  all know it and that's the scuttlebutton Washington but I and I said I'm sorry sir
[04:06.720 --> 04:13.840]  it's already public and that was back in April 2002 nine years ago nine plus
[04:13.840 --> 04:25.000]  years ago nine years and a month and change but I didn't stop there but what
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  did Pachennick say they had him on ice ice and we're gonna roll him out of
[04:28.000 --> 04:34.120]  opportune moment then I got two other winehouse sources just so happens that

[04:38.960 --> 04:44.840]  governor here turns out when you go to cocktail parties people get drunk not
[04:44.840 --> 04:50.560]  once but twice they told me the exact same thing and then Madeleine Albright
[04:50.560 --> 04:57.920]  said it on Fox News oh we forget about that and then well other people in
[04:57.920 --> 05:03.320]  government came out oh it's staged hundreds of nations have fallen to
[05:03.320 --> 05:08.600]  tyranny in the last century alone this is our last chance to not relive history

[06:16.760 --> 06:21.080]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[06:21.080 --> 06:25.440]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[06:25.440 --> 06:29.200]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[06:29.200 --> 06:33.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of

[08:59.440 --> 09:07.920]  interested in getting my take my position on the bin laden assassination
[09:07.920 --> 09:12.960]  hoax and it is a hoax just like when Clinton got caught with Monica Lewinsky
[09:12.960 --> 09:18.240]  lying and they said that's it he's got a step down today he cruise missile to a
[09:18.240 --> 09:23.400]  aspirin factory in Africa or when they wanted to attack Vietnam they staged
[09:23.400 --> 09:29.400]  attacks on the ships and lied for 40 years about it declassifying it in 2004
[09:29.400 --> 09:33.320]  the conspiracy theorists were 100% right we were not conspiracy theorists it was
[09:33.320 --> 09:39.040]  in the San Diego Herald Tribune in 1964 six months later when the ship got back
[09:39.040 --> 09:44.400]  and senior officers said it was a lie but see then it becomes a rumor that
[09:44.400 --> 09:50.760]  folks read that people don't go check the microfilm we did it was staged so we
[09:50.760 --> 09:56.560]  were right in 2004 they declassified it don't forget Operation Northwoods where
[09:56.560 --> 10:01.320]  they went to Kennedy and said we want to bomb DC bomb Miami attack US military
[10:01.320 --> 10:05.040]  bases and basically have war with the Cubans and then the Soviets and he said
[10:05.040 --> 10:12.720]  you people are crazy you're all fired and they said no you die and you saw what
[10:12.720 --> 10:15.920]  happened that public execution and everybody says wow we saw the men up
[10:15.920 --> 10:19.280]  there shooting behind the no they're like oh how about a hundred of you plus
[10:19.280 --> 10:24.280]  die in the next week oh your mommy saw the men back there oh the guy at the
[10:24.280 --> 10:27.920]  train switching station saw the guys in the back of the green truck firing
[10:27.920 --> 10:33.760]  through the no but how about he dies see they wanted everybody to know they'd
[10:33.760 --> 10:37.480]  killed Kennedy in government that's why they publicly executed him they could
[10:37.480 --> 10:42.680]  have poisoned him they had their people all over him at the White House the
[10:42.680 --> 10:46.920]  Secret Service was involved they wanted those that could think to know and the
[10:46.920 --> 10:51.880]  rest of the idiot public to buy into whatever they were told well see not me
[10:51.880 --> 10:57.520]  not me okay I will I'm not born to be conned and an idiot for the criminal
[10:57.520 --> 11:02.560]  elements that have taken our country over now instead of me giving you my
[11:02.560 --> 11:10.240]  view and telling you what I think May 2nd 2011 you notice he was killed on
[11:10.240 --> 11:15.960]  the same day Hitler died May Day you know May Day isn't just a communist
[11:15.960 --> 11:22.480]  holiday the Illuminati was founded in 1776 the Ingolstadt University on May Day
[11:22.480 --> 11:26.800]  if you actually go to the encyclopedia May Day is an ancient high holy day of
[11:26.800 --> 11:33.680]  the Druids you notice that on the same day that Hitler married Eva Braun in
[11:33.680 --> 11:38.360]  the bunker three days before he committed suicide is the day that the
[11:38.360 --> 11:45.160]  Royals got married oh they're all into this stuff big time and and I remember
[11:45.160 --> 11:48.880]  John the crew Sunday on the Sunday show you last I said I something big is
[11:48.880 --> 11:52.200]  going to happen today it's May Day they always love to do something big I don't
[11:52.200 --> 11:57.040]  know what it's going to be then I got home at about 10 o'clock and the phones
[11:57.040 --> 12:00.720]  were ringing my wife ran in and we stayed up most of the night getting the
[12:00.720 --> 12:05.480]  reports out at info wars.com and prison planet.com but you know why should I
[12:05.480 --> 12:11.920]  tell you what I think is happening in hindsight that's too easy how about we
[12:11.920 --> 12:17.560]  see what Alex Jones said not a year ago not five years ago nine years ago in a
[12:17.560 --> 12:22.360]  month the full transcripts we're digging around to the MP3's we're going to find
[12:22.360 --> 12:33.520]  them are all up on info wars.com and prison planet.com I brought you the adjunct
[12:33.520 --> 12:45.680]  of Henry Kissinger when he was Secretary of State Stephen R. Stephen R.
[12:45.680 --> 12:53.680]  Pachennick P-I-E-C-Z-E-N-I-K in April 2002 over nine years ago Council on
[12:53.680 --> 12:58.160]  Farm Relations member high-level Stephen R. Pachennick who served as
[12:58.160 --> 13:02.280]  Japanese Assistant Secretary of State under Henry Kissinger Cyrus Vance and
[13:02.280 --> 13:06.480]  James Baker top king makers told the Alex Jones show that bin Laden had already
[13:06.480 --> 13:11.800]  been dead for months. He went on to say you can read the whole transcript but
[13:11.800 --> 13:14.600]  Pachennick would be in a position to know such information having worked
[13:14.600 --> 13:19.160]  directly with bin Laden when the US was funding and arming the terror leader in
[13:19.160 --> 13:22.840]  an attempt to drive the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late 70s and early
[13:22.840 --> 13:28.520]  80s yet started in 79 Charlie Wilson's wars alive and start in 83 documented
[13:28.520 --> 13:31.120]  historical fact that talking heads in the corporate media are actually
[13:31.120 --> 13:35.400]  denying today in a lot of developments. I worked with the some of bin Laden in
[13:35.400 --> 13:39.640]  78 81 Pachennick told Jones adding that he later turned terrorist hunter during
[13:39.640 --> 13:43.960]  subsequent administrations. I found out through my sources that he had kidney
[13:43.960 --> 13:51.160]  disease by the way after he reported all this CBS News did about him being at the
[13:51.160 --> 13:55.440]  American hospital. I found out through my sources he had kidney disease and as a
[13:55.440 --> 14:00.600]  physician I knew that he had to have two dialysis machines and he was dying
[14:00.600 --> 14:06.840]  Pachennick told Jones during the April 24 2002 interview and you could see those
[14:06.840 --> 14:11.520]  in the films who's made up photos I'm reading from Pachennick they were
[14:11.520 --> 14:16.080]  sending us out of nowhere I mean suddenly we would see a video of bin
[14:16.080 --> 14:19.880]  Laden today and then out of nowhere they said oh it was sent to us you
[14:19.880 --> 14:23.640]  anonymously meaning that someone in the government our government was
[14:23.640 --> 14:28.840]  trying to keep up morale on our side and say oh we still have to chase this guy
[14:28.840 --> 14:34.040]  when in the fact he's been dead for months added Pachennick he went on to
[14:34.040 --> 14:39.800]  say that he was basically on ice and would be rolled out at a politically
[14:39.800 --> 14:46.440]  expedient time quote on ice and he would be brought out a quote a politically
[14:46.440 --> 14:56.680]  expedient time then in 2003 a high level White House source told me in Austin
[14:56.680 --> 15:00.700]  you notice folks we have high-level sources like General Hamid Ghul former
[15:00.700 --> 15:05.200]  head of Pakistani intelligence who led these forces is going to be joining us
[15:05.200 --> 15:14.280]  in about 30 minutes you'll notice we were sent the internal FBI Mayak and
[15:14.280 --> 15:17.980]  Homeland Security reports and for a week people didn't believe it even Ron
[15:17.980 --> 15:21.240]  Paul's office was calling me and going Alex you really got this from federal
[15:21.240 --> 15:24.880]  marshals you really got this other document from state police I'm like
[15:24.880 --> 15:28.720]  call the phone number it's on there yes and later the government said yes it's
[15:28.720 --> 15:33.400]  our memos yes we defend it folks you got to learn that we've got the sources
[15:33.400 --> 15:37.000]  because people who are whistleblowers know we've got the courage to run with
[15:37.000 --> 15:43.040]  it after we check it out and to not whitewash their main intent I won't try
[15:43.040 --> 15:47.000]  to get a hold of Pachennick by the way Pachennick let's check and see if he's
[15:47.000 --> 15:49.480]  alive I'm sure he is but let's I haven't even done that yet because this is all
[15:49.480 --> 15:53.120]  moving fast Pachennick called me about a month after the interview he said I'm
[15:53.120 --> 15:56.880]  getting incredible heat from the CFR from government it's well known in those
[15:56.880 --> 16:02.240]  circles he's buds with Tom Clancy he wrote about a plane being fought a
[16:02.240 --> 16:06.440]  passenger jet in the World Trade Center a year before point is he said I'm
[16:06.440 --> 16:09.440]  getting a lot of heat please take down the transcript and I said I'm sorry I
[16:09.440 --> 16:14.920]  can't do that Steve it's already public now I say I have two other White House
[16:14.920 --> 16:20.120]  forces one of them I talked to the other was through a well-known associate
[16:20.120 --> 16:30.200]  someone I've known most my life who was at another high-powered event associated
[16:30.200 --> 16:35.720]  with a school that's all I'm gonna say and at that event this government
[16:35.720 --> 16:41.200]  official a separate one was bragging see this is not a secret that's why you've
[16:41.200 --> 16:45.640]  seen the guy that they made the movie Siriana about the CIA agent Bear coming
[16:45.640 --> 16:49.000]  out saying he was dead a long time ago kidney failure that's why you got CBS
[16:49.000 --> 16:53.800]  News reporting eight years ago that's why you've got Madeleine Albright Madeleine
[16:53.800 --> 16:56.920]  Albright here's the world net daily I'm still trying to find the video we have
[16:56.920 --> 17:01.080]  video of her talking about it on c-span but not the actual Fox world net daily
[17:01.080 --> 17:06.360]  December 17 2003 it was on December 16th she was on Fox News Albright thinks

[17:30.560 --> 17:35.080]  shouldn't reveal this his he did threaten me his lawyer threatened me and I
[17:35.080 --> 17:41.720]  said let's let's dance but own I could only talk about what was seen in public
[17:41.720 --> 17:47.640]  in 2003 Lionel Chetwin who made a movie about Bush being a hero 9-11 I was
[17:47.640 --> 17:51.920]  flown out to be on conspiracy zone with Kevin Nieland and I'm in the big off the
[17:51.920 --> 17:54.760]  big set we've all got our own dressing room is it right off the set we're
[17:54.760 --> 17:58.400]  waiting with other guests is a bathroom your big bathroom nobody's in there I
[17:58.400 --> 18:03.880]  go to the urinal I'm washing my hands Lionel Chetwin walks over and he says
[18:03.880 --> 18:12.760]  you're Alex Jones we're going to effing get you and I vote up to him I said I
[18:12.760 --> 18:17.560]  said you think I do what I do and I don't think you guys are gangsters and
[18:17.560 --> 18:22.040]  then he said something else but then I would only because of his threats
[18:22.040 --> 18:25.080]  afterwards talk about what was witnessed because I was smart they had the young
[18:25.080 --> 18:29.400]  women you know who lead the guest around waiting outside with their clipboards
[18:29.400 --> 18:33.440]  and as we're walking out he's still saying things I go Chetwin just threatened
[18:33.440 --> 18:38.440]  me because I wanted it on record and he went I'm just was I was just joking and
[18:38.440 --> 18:43.040]  when Chetwin and his lawyer called me I said I got witnesses we'll go ahead and
[18:43.040 --> 18:47.760]  sue me we will we will we will subpoena those women well Chetwin said
[18:47.760 --> 18:51.800]  something else to me in that bathroom you could probably guess what it was you
[18:51.800 --> 18:55.880]  know what they were mad about that pechenic interview sent shockwaves
[18:55.880 --> 19:00.280]  through them because this is one of their ultimate getting shells right now
[19:00.280 --> 19:05.000]  one of their ultimate propaganda weapons was this bin Laden super ace in the

[19:18.360 --> 19:23.320]  just threatened me in the bathroom I'm sorry folks it's not that I got courage
[19:23.320 --> 19:27.040]  when you threaten me I tend to run at you it's fight or flight well you know
[19:27.040 --> 19:32.280]  what I'm too lazy to run you got it all the time I got energies when I'm

[24:15.640 --> 24:24.000]  intelligence Hamid Ghul joining us and I would expect that he's gonna make the
[24:24.000 --> 24:28.960]  point that Pakistani intelligence was involved in this raid and because all he
[24:28.960 --> 24:34.120]  wants is the US to get out of Pakistan again I want to be clear here not one
[24:34.120 --> 24:39.680]  not two but three two of them that I spoke to directly one of them who I can
[24:39.680 --> 24:44.320]  reveal because he was live on air Steve Pachennick the number two under
[24:44.320 --> 24:50.160]  Kissinger saying he's dead died of kidney failure they're going to roll him out
[24:50.160 --> 24:54.680]  Madeline Albright same thing died of kidney failure they've got him frozen
[24:54.680 --> 25:02.880]  gonna roll him out Fox News December 16 2003 on Morton Kondraki program being
[25:02.880 --> 25:12.640]  interviewed by Morton Kondraki now remember in 2000 remember in 2001 2002
[25:12.640 --> 25:18.960]  they kept saying that they had him in their sights in Pakistan the special
[25:18.960 --> 25:21.880]  forces were ready to kill him on the ground they had drones they were told
[25:21.880 --> 25:30.440]  stand down whether you believe those stories or not the government admits
[25:30.440 --> 25:35.840]  that they gave the order to not kill him at those times and why because whether
[25:35.840 --> 25:40.960]  they really had the real bin Laden their sights are not they want that myth to
[25:40.960 --> 25:47.840]  continue and go on as a pretext to keep expanding these wars now remember if
[25:47.840 --> 25:55.920]  some have been laden on record was a CIA asset his codename was Tim Oswin and if
[25:55.920 --> 25:59.440]  you don't know about this this is even in Newsweek we have those articles linked
[25:59.440 --> 26:03.440]  to the articles we've written in 79 Brzezinski's now written two books on
[26:03.440 --> 26:10.040]  this they start having al-Qaeda slash Taliban attack Russian bases on the
[26:10.040 --> 26:15.120]  Afghan border to the north the three nations that border it two of which the
[26:15.120 --> 26:22.920]  Russians were in to get them to come in in 1981 or late 1980 and that's all on
[26:22.920 --> 26:29.360]  record they wanted the Russians to have their own Vietnam and so General Hameed
[26:29.360 --> 26:36.000]  ghoul leading the Taliban forces the out of Pakistan in Afghanistan the US
[26:36.000 --> 26:46.400]  forming the base of a secret army of Saudi Arabian CIA Israeli controlled al-Qaeda
[26:46.400 --> 26:53.320]  and they launched these attacks now magically on 9-11 Newsweek MSNBC report
[26:53.320 --> 26:58.560]  that Bush had the launch order to launch the attack on Afghanistan signed
[26:58.560 --> 27:06.640]  September 10th 2001 he signed the order a day before in the six months before they
[27:06.640 --> 27:13.000]  mass 44,000 US troops 18,000 British troops into Jigashandrish Bikistan they
[27:13.000 --> 27:18.840]  had the whole invasion force lined up before 9-11 now what does FBI
[27:18.840 --> 27:24.320]  translator Sybil Evans say she's she testifies the Congress they put a gag
[27:24.320 --> 27:28.920]  order on her later she breaks the gag order two years ago and she does public
[27:28.920 --> 27:37.800]  she was listening to FBI tapes off echelon of the CIA quote drug dealing
[27:37.800 --> 27:43.920]  arms dealing and running al-Qaeda including the day of 9-11 and now the
[27:43.920 --> 27:48.520]  army doesn't know about this most of the intelligence agencies don't know a lot
[27:48.520 --> 27:51.800]  of the ground troops they're gonna fight that are called jihadis al-Qaeda
[27:51.800 --> 27:58.520]  Taliban whatever name they give them they don't know that's why when they took
[27:58.520 --> 28:05.880]  over Afghanistan Kandahar Kabul times of London reported on the airlift of evil
[28:05.880 --> 28:09.120]  you can search any of these terms pull it up we're 8,000 Taliban and al-Qaeda
[28:09.120 --> 28:15.440]  leaders who were captured were ordered flown out to Pakistan and released now
[28:15.440 --> 28:19.320]  those same guys have been flown into Libya to attack Qaddafi and we're
[28:19.320 --> 28:23.720]  hearing how there are little heroes and that al-Qaeda ain't so bad they're
[28:23.720 --> 28:29.800]  doing this to end one phase of the psychological war and move on with new
[28:29.800 --> 28:35.200]  boogeymen like Amar al-Laki who's admittedly grew up born in New Mexico
[28:35.200 --> 28:38.480]  and then runs all the major terror attacks in the West the underwear bomber
[28:38.480 --> 28:42.440]  the shoe bomber the Fort Hood shooter the Times Square attacker the government
[28:42.440 --> 28:46.960]  says he's running him he's controlling these nutpatsies that are real terrorists
[28:46.960 --> 28:51.960]  he's he's finding them and and funding them and he's being protected and he's
[28:51.960 --> 28:57.760]  meeting secretly at the Pentagon and I was on with man cow this morning on a
[28:57.760 --> 29:00.960]  syndicated show and he's like well you claimed that and I said really search
[29:00.960 --> 29:05.800]  this term Amar al-Laki dined at the Pentagon months after 9-11 when he was
[29:05.800 --> 29:11.040]  most wanted and they went wow it's there you know it's there stop acting like
[29:11.040 --> 29:15.760]  it's not there so everybody's supposed to be overwhelmed with this pride and play

[34:14.360 --> 34:17.880]  goodness the tsa is there and they're upping security airports and train
[34:17.880 --> 34:22.760]  stations and may have checkpoints and they're calling back of the nuclear
[34:22.760 --> 34:28.000]  chemical biological teams from Japan that we're helping because my gosh al-qaeda
[34:28.000 --> 34:32.480]  is about to hit us any minute so you better be glad that we're in Afghanistan
[34:32.480 --> 34:37.360]  and Libya and everywhere else well and Libya it's the good al-qaeda the media
[34:37.360 --> 34:41.640]  says so need to be patriotic support those guys like John McCain said I mean
[34:41.640 --> 34:46.480]  this is how ridiculous it is and then scripted on a Sunday night so it would
[34:46.480 --> 34:50.040]  dominate so the newspapers only have an hour or two to take whatever the
[34:50.040 --> 34:54.920]  White House said no critical thinking so the alternative media couldn't get
[34:54.920 --> 34:59.800]  ready to respond to it but we never sleep so we were on it great team curtain
[34:59.800 --> 35:04.480]  MO Paul Watson myself last night kicking butt until 3-4 in the morning kicking
[35:04.480 --> 35:08.880]  rumpus jaren was calling me at like 11 12 at night he was working on getting the
[35:08.880 --> 35:13.680]  big guess we've got coming up and boom we're out front info wars is pretty much
[35:13.680 --> 35:18.080]  down right now it can't handle a million people it basically at once prison
[35:18.080 --> 35:21.800]  planet is still up we're struggling to keep info wars up all the news that's an
[35:21.800 --> 35:26.880]  info wars is cloned over at prison planet get it out folks over at prison
[35:26.880 --> 35:31.440]  planet dot com now now let me just go over a smattering of some of the
[35:31.440 --> 35:35.840]  background here of what's happened remember Steve Pachennick the right-hand
[35:35.840 --> 35:38.440]  man in the State Department of Henry Kissinger comes out and says he's on ice
[35:38.440 --> 35:42.600]  he's dead they're gonna roll him out he says that in April 2002 first place ever
[35:42.600 --> 35:46.960]  reported ever told very high-powered he gets a lot of threats over it calls me
[35:46.960 --> 35:51.840]  begging me to remove the transcript I said you know the barn door is open and
[35:51.840 --> 35:56.320]  that horse left a long time ago that train left the station buddy high-level
[35:56.320 --> 36:01.000]  council on farm relations member then a high-level Bush administration
[36:01.000 --> 36:07.480]  individual who lived in Austin between DC just I'll give you a couple dozen of
[36:07.480 --> 36:12.320]  them but this just gave you the source with Pachennick with the transcript on
[36:12.320 --> 36:17.080]  record that's nine years and a month old then about a year later White House
[36:17.080 --> 36:23.280]  source who I run into just makes the big joke about we got it all set in the
[36:23.280 --> 36:26.400]  campaign doesn't matter we'll just bring bin Laden out a week or two before the
[36:26.400 --> 36:33.040]  thing we got him on ice yeah he's dead and the story is universal from these
[36:33.040 --> 36:38.760]  sources he was dying of kidney failure so they just killed him in Pakistan that's
[36:38.760 --> 36:43.360]  nine years ago and people say well how do they have these Marines lie well
[36:43.360 --> 36:47.240]  you're not seeing them on the news you know they'll all write books later and
[36:47.240 --> 36:53.560]  be movie stars and Matt Damon will undoubtedly you'll be playing them or
[36:53.560 --> 36:59.000]  George Clooney but you've got in the middle of a city on the edge of the
[36:59.000 --> 37:03.800]  city this big giant palace compound and the thing is blowing up and fire
[37:03.800 --> 37:09.680]  shooting out of it and they basically just grab some guy with a beard and say
[37:09.680 --> 37:14.240]  that's him even if they did that and then to get rid of the body they
[37:14.240 --> 37:20.040]  immediately to follow Islamic law quote run out and burial at sea so that there
[37:20.040 --> 37:24.360]  can't be a shrine but don't worry they've got DNA they're going to tell you
[37:24.360 --> 37:30.360]  that the results really Houston crime lab San Francisco crime lab FBI crime
[37:30.360 --> 37:35.440]  lab I've had the former head of the crime lab on dr. Frederick Whitehurst 15
[37:35.440 --> 37:42.680]  years ago 10 years ago then last year breaking down the industrial fraud it
[37:42.680 --> 37:47.040]  came out in Houston tens of thousands of people were framed over a decade under
[37:47.040 --> 37:51.840]  orders oh but oh but the federal government they'll release some DNA
[37:51.840 --> 37:56.240]  evidence that we can supposedly trust but let's go even further here we'll put
[37:56.240 --> 38:00.760]  this article up on screen it's at info wars.com and prison planet.com this was
[38:00.760 --> 38:06.560]  already out last night and ran in hundreds of papers across the world a
[38:06.560 --> 38:11.520]  photo of bin Laden and they put out two different versions for the public and
[38:11.520 --> 38:15.800]  said this is the photo oh this is it they knew full well it wasn't the photo
[38:15.800 --> 38:19.640]  that it had been out for many years as another fake they'd released we have
[38:19.640 --> 38:22.880]  another article that Osama bin Laden has been pronounced dead for the ninth
[38:22.880 --> 38:27.000]  time and then we have links from the Kobe report to the research I knew it was
[38:27.000 --> 38:31.360]  a bunch but not nine times nine times they killed him he had nine lives this
[38:31.360 --> 38:35.840]  cat did and they finally got we have links to all the mainstream news articles
[38:35.840 --> 38:43.480]  in the article at prison planet.com where you can go read the nine times they
[38:43.480 --> 38:47.480]  killed him which time do you want to believe well this is the finale I mean
[38:47.480 --> 38:52.960]  it with this big announcement before it would just be yeah we killed him but and
[38:52.960 --> 38:57.760]  we'll show you that photo they they put out a clearly doctored photo with some
[38:57.760 --> 39:03.320]  gauze and a bandage on his chest and his mouth open in his head all all all
[39:03.320 --> 39:08.880]  all and you know blown to bits and from about 10 o'clock last night until about
[39:08.880 --> 39:13.920]  7 a.m. this morning they ran it in newspapers and everywhere saying there's
[39:13.920 --> 39:18.000]  the dead bin Laden and I kept hearing phone calls this morning it's great I
[39:18.000 --> 39:22.600]  got to see the photo of that dead rat for they throw in the ocean I'm walking a
[39:22.600 --> 39:26.680]  little taller little spring in my step but the talk show host we want to hear
[39:26.680 --> 39:30.320]  from our military people that we care so much about you're flying on the
[39:30.320 --> 39:34.680]  airplane and the captain goes we have two military people on board everybody
[39:34.680 --> 39:38.520]  please give him a round of applause it's all just part of this you've got to
[39:38.520 --> 39:42.640]  support the troops but supporting the troops means supporting whatever the
[39:42.640 --> 39:46.480]  government says whatever war they launch but then when they cut their
[39:46.480 --> 39:49.920]  pensions or take steal their death benefits or try to make them pay for
[39:49.920 --> 39:53.040]  their own medical care and flush them down the toilet when they go on food
[39:53.040 --> 39:57.720]  stamps well let's not discuss that that's not patriotic or when they die of
[39:57.720 --> 40:01.560]  D poisoning or they have four times as many deformed children even life
[40:01.560 --> 40:06.400]  magazine reports well then the VA is not going to give you any help remember the
[40:06.400 --> 40:10.400]  Marine officer dying in the wheelchair who'd been in such great shape the
[40:10.400 --> 40:14.280]  Marine Corps captain from the VX nerve gas that got destroyed at Camacea
[40:14.280 --> 40:19.280]  begging for help before Congress in like 94 saying I need treatment and
[40:19.280 --> 40:24.560]  crying well that's unpatriotic him asking for treatment I just say I support
[40:24.560 --> 40:29.680]  the troops thank you so much for your service I mean you just see it
[40:29.680 --> 40:33.960]  constantly I'm like oh really well troops I'll actually try to make sure you
[40:33.960 --> 40:37.680]  don't use DU and die from it I'll try to make sure they don't steal your death
[40:37.680 --> 40:44.200]  benefits as they did 11 years ago in a secret deal now public last year see
[40:44.200 --> 40:48.640]  it's all just this hollow Obama's plunging in the approval ratings the
[40:48.640 --> 40:53.560]  wars are unpopular the dollar is going into the toilet circling circling the
[40:53.560 --> 41:00.600]  the tubes and then magically on May day on international commie day out comes
[41:00.600 --> 41:04.560]  Obama and you could just look at his body language we'll play the video later
[41:04.560 --> 41:08.520]  I mean he is lying if a used car salesman was looking at me like that saying
[41:08.520 --> 41:13.080]  there's no problem with this car it's not gonna throw a rod and then you start
[41:13.080 --> 41:17.680]  listening and you hear the rod about to be thrown I mean it just radiated as he
[41:17.680 --> 41:23.240]  read off that teleprompter lies and deception and dissembling and that he
[41:23.240 --> 41:29.240]  could barely with a straight face sit there and deliver this propaganda the
[41:29.240 --> 41:33.040]  Russians reportedly from a lot of the reporters that got killed for trying to
[41:33.040 --> 41:38.440]  report on it at that bees lawn massacre people say well were there terrorists
[41:38.440 --> 41:41.720]  inside killing the kids because they wanted to invade another country they
[41:41.720 --> 41:44.600]  said terrorists from Chechnya were in there and it turned out from the
[41:44.600 --> 41:48.640]  witnesses that did survive they were guys with masks on and then they started
[41:48.640 --> 41:53.360]  shooting everybody threw a bomb in ran out the back and then the military this
[41:53.360 --> 41:57.120]  is on record the Russian troops let them get away and then blew the whole
[41:57.120 --> 42:01.920]  building up so there's such a big fog of war and fire and death nobody knows
[42:01.920 --> 42:05.200]  where the guys with the mask went then you take couple the dead bodies of the
[42:05.200 --> 42:09.920]  people in the school put mask on them and say look we've got the guys that did
[42:09.920 --> 42:14.480]  it and so it's real simple it's over in a third-world country the globalist
[42:14.480 --> 42:20.320]  control they rocket and bomb and blow it up and it's on fire and burning and the
[42:20.320 --> 42:24.920]  Marines may even think they killed bin Laden because we know the CIA has been
[42:24.920 --> 42:29.200]  lot in doubles too they love to set up decoys set up patsies come like there
[42:29.200 --> 42:36.000]  are two or three Oswald's running around in in in Dallas it was confirmed just to
[42:36.000 --> 42:39.360]  confuse everything and so there's some guy with a turban a big beard in there
[42:39.360 --> 42:42.600]  and it's his part to you know play along with something and they kill him
[42:42.600 --> 42:47.240]  dead in the hammer who knows what happened all I know is Steve Pacenek
[42:47.240 --> 42:51.840]  number two under Kissinger at the State Department comes on and says he's on ice
[42:51.840 --> 42:55.400]  nine years ago dead and they're gonna roll him out later when they feel like
[42:55.400 --> 43:00.360]  it two other sources telling me that off record Madeline Albright three years
[43:00.360 --> 43:04.840]  after I first break all this down two and a half years after I break it down
[43:04.840 --> 43:09.640]  goes on Fox News and says they've got him on ice they're gonna roll him out
[43:09.640 --> 43:13.040]  oh they're thinking about it and then the word is they didn't because of all the
[43:13.040 --> 43:19.400]  attention it was getting that's why the system that's why that's why when I ran
[43:19.400 --> 43:23.840]  into that head White House the head of media operations got in the bathroom he
[43:23.840 --> 43:28.960]  was so angry in Los Angeles I didn't run into him I was debating him about to
[43:28.960 --> 43:33.200]  debate him on TV and he and he was in there and I really was extremely upset
[43:33.200 --> 43:39.320]  because this stuff had just come out a year before because this is their big
[43:39.320 --> 43:44.160]  plan this is their big program this is their big operation now now the guy we've
[43:44.160 --> 43:49.280]  got scheduled to come on on record has met and and knows the summer bin Laden
[43:49.280 --> 43:53.800]  he was called a hero in the 80s fighting the Russians they had a Pakistani
[43:53.800 --> 43:59.040]  intelligence the former tank commander and a big veteran of the war with the
[43:59.040 --> 44:06.640]  Indians decades before general Hamed ghoul and Pakistan is strategic I will
[44:06.640 --> 44:09.880]  imagine that they're gonna want to play along with oh yes you killed him and we
[44:09.880 --> 44:13.640]  helped you and that is being reported that the Pakistanis helped in this
[44:13.640 --> 44:19.880]  helped in this and the Pakistanis are gonna now say please leave and the
[44:19.880 --> 44:23.440]  intel that I was already getting from sources is they might produce bin Laden
[44:23.440 --> 44:28.720]  but I've heard this so long I ignored it too perhaps as an entree to start
[44:28.720 --> 44:32.080]  pulling out of Pakistan right at the point the Pakistan government says get
[44:32.080 --> 44:36.320]  your drones out get out of here now they may actually use this to expand it and
[44:36.320 --> 44:41.160]  I'm hearing that call in the media I heard Senator Graham on on TV this
[44:41.160 --> 44:47.000]  morning driving and listening to television saying that he that he shows
[44:47.000 --> 44:51.400]  that Pakistan's duplicitous and basically our enemy and he tried to talk
[44:51.400 --> 44:54.560]  about al-Qaeda and Libya why we need to be there to fight al-Qaeda went on
[44:54.560 --> 44:58.440]  record Washington Post LA Times they have to admit the core of the quote
[44:58.440 --> 45:06.160]  freedom fighters in Libya in the east are al-Qaeda and Taliban so folks they
[45:06.160 --> 45:14.440]  think you're so dumb that they produced a fake bin Laden photo and gave it to the
[45:14.440 --> 45:19.040]  newspapers and the newspapers all ran with a photo shop the government had
[45:19.040 --> 45:22.760]  already put out three years ago of him with it you know bullet holes in his
[45:22.760 --> 45:28.480]  head and his face all smashed in and they know emotionally people needed to
[45:28.480 --> 45:33.240]  see the dead body you know hideous corpus goes back not just to show the body
[45:33.240 --> 45:36.520]  if you're gonna go to jail for something they need evidence of it show the
[45:36.520 --> 45:41.560]  person you killed it even predates that in a dual way that if the king said
[45:41.560 --> 45:44.960]  there's a bounty on this person you had to bring the body bring him in dead or
[45:44.960 --> 45:49.040]  alive but bring the body bring the body strapped over the horse or you don't
[45:49.040 --> 45:55.000]  get the bounty but you notice in this dead or alive we don't get to see it and
[45:55.000 --> 45:58.680]  you know like Mussolini being hauled up in Rome by his feet to be spit on for
[45:58.680 --> 46:02.600]  three days by hundreds of thousands of people or Chilchescu you know you want
[46:02.600 --> 46:06.560]  to see the body we saw Saddam hung we he was in a prison for a year in front of
[46:06.560 --> 46:19.240]  everybody where is the body where is the body where is the body no we're not
[46:19.240 --> 46:23.320]  being shown that he's thrown into the ocean and I told Curtin Emma last night
[46:23.320 --> 46:30.000]  I said we need to part in the article about where is his body and conveniently
[46:30.000 --> 46:35.680]  they thrown in the ocean now joining us from Pakistan and we'll find out how
[46:35.680 --> 46:39.440]  close to where this reportedly happened outside one of their largest cities is
[46:39.440 --> 46:43.800]  general Hamed Ghul retired Pakistani Army general served as the director
[46:43.800 --> 46:48.440]  general of Pakistan he's inner service intelligence he was instrumental in the
[46:48.440 --> 46:56.080]  anti-Soviet support of Mujahideen in the Afghan war in 79 to 89 it was also a
[46:56.080 --> 47:02.560]  veteran of the war with India as a ground soldier and we appreciate Hamed
[47:02.560 --> 47:07.920]  Ghul joining us to give us his take on what is unfolding here sir thank you
[47:07.920 --> 47:14.440]  for joining us general ghul you've got the floor what do you make of this I I
[47:14.440 --> 47:19.320]  see it as a complete Psyop because my White House sources nine years ago on
[47:19.320 --> 47:25.800]  record confirmed that he had been killed and was frozen on ice but I mean is
[47:25.800 --> 47:30.920]  there what's your take on this well they had a cell that done away with it
[47:30.920 --> 47:39.240]  sometimes in 2005 there was a cell which was meant specially to chase and track
[47:39.240 --> 47:43.920]  who found Aladdin and then it was called off I mean that was abolished all
[47:43.920 --> 47:48.680]  together so you're quite right there is a great deal of suspicion especially that
[47:48.680 --> 47:53.000]  the the question of body as you were mentioning it's a very important question
[47:53.000 --> 47:59.520]  now you know that every single U.S. soldier carries a video camera in his
[47:59.520 --> 48:04.000]  helmet and why that footage has not been shown to the world so that the world
[48:04.000 --> 48:08.120]  would be convinced and the one picture that I saw for some of the London that
[48:08.120 --> 48:15.800]  looks very young Osama and the London 10 years ago was older and this where
[48:15.800 --> 48:20.240]  picture showed him even younger than that come in comparison I know sir they
[48:20.240 --> 48:23.440]  now admit it's a fake photo so this they already put fake photos out to the
[48:23.440 --> 48:28.120]  media showing the complete a disregard for the public but but going back
[48:28.120 --> 48:32.040]  specifically sir as you point out it was obviously a younger bin Laden from
[48:32.040 --> 48:36.320]  what he would be today it looks like about a 1999 photo that's been photoshopped
[48:36.320 --> 48:40.680]  and they admit that but what about President Benazir Budo she said that
[48:40.680 --> 48:46.800]  bin Laden had been killed and was dead and then she was of course murdered break
[48:46.800 --> 48:51.440]  that down for a sir
[48:51.440 --> 48:54.440]  remember
[48:54.440 --> 48:58.440]  he said I know he's dead
[48:58.440 --> 49:05.480]  by that then this seems to be just a make-believe drama in the aid of Obama's
[49:05.480 --> 49:12.720]  campaign makes here for his rerun of the presidential election of course he was
[49:12.720 --> 49:17.720]  he's got all the advantage for it but it's only a symbolic victory I look at
[49:17.720 --> 49:23.520]  it differently and let me explain it to you I think Osama bin Laden if at all he
[49:23.520 --> 49:28.720]  was living he was a very very ill man and he would have passed in any case with
[49:28.720 --> 49:35.120]  passage of time over 10 years his image and his cloud has receded into the
[49:35.120 --> 49:41.720]  history and now with this the is he putting up a fight one helicopter
[49:41.720 --> 49:45.920]  brought down and his wife stood in front of him and his son was killed along with
[49:45.920 --> 49:53.480]  his two gods but this is going to create a stuff that is fit for the folklore for
[49:53.480 --> 50:00.360]  the legend-making and and for the battle battle ballot so I think that is
[50:00.360 --> 50:05.840]  Amma is going to be a terrible phenomena for you for the Americans and for the
[50:05.840 --> 50:12.920]  Western world because this is going to enrage the Arab opinion because an Arab
[50:12.920 --> 50:17.320]  opinion was so badly hurt when Saddam Hussein was caught and he was dragged
[50:17.320 --> 50:22.920]  out of a rat hole and he was humiliated so this was a sort of a shame that was
[50:22.920 --> 50:29.920]  heard on the Arab psyche but this time round it's going to be different Osama
[50:29.920 --> 50:36.360]  will appear as now a hero and he will be act in the memory of the people and
[50:36.360 --> 50:42.040]  already the Arab wave of public wave which is on the rise is going to catch
[50:42.040 --> 50:47.680]  hold of it and if that wave does not get satisfied through the democratic means
[50:47.680 --> 50:52.400]  and then and as it as it appears they are being locked then I think they will be left
[50:52.400 --> 50:57.720]  with no choice but to adapt to the philosophy that Osama bin Laden had
[50:57.720 --> 51:03.280]  there I've made an update General Hamid ghoul I completely concur for Western
[51:03.280 --> 51:07.360]  opinion it makes Obama look like he's tough a week after he kicks off his
[51:07.360 --> 51:13.320]  election campaign it makes you the wars look like they've paid off but all over
[51:13.320 --> 51:18.200]  Central Asia the Middle East it builds him up as a guy that went out in a blaze
[51:18.200 --> 51:24.880]  of glory you know up on the mountaintop like in for the bell tolls I mean this
[51:24.880 --> 51:31.480]  really sells that image and really resuscitates bin Laden who had faded
[51:31.480 --> 51:34.600]  back into the annals but Madeline Albright sir and I would direct you to
[51:34.600 --> 51:38.520]  prisonplanet.com and infowars.com though the sites are pretty much down right now
[51:38.520 --> 51:44.120]  because of mega traffic we I was told by and I'm just giving you this intel
[51:44.120 --> 51:47.520]  because I'm going to be able to look into it Steve Pachennik who was the
[51:47.520 --> 51:51.760]  number two man under Kissinger who said he worked with bin Laden and work with
[51:51.760 --> 51:58.600]  the Pakistanis against the Russians he told me in April of 2002 that he was
[51:58.600 --> 52:02.160]  dead on ice and that would be rolled out whenever they felt like it then
[52:02.160 --> 52:06.640]  Albright came out on Fox News a year later and said that and I had two other
[52:06.640 --> 52:10.680]  White House sources before this was even news tell me this and these are high
[52:10.680 --> 52:15.760]  powered people who were proud of this and they're so arrogant that they would
[52:15.760 --> 52:21.720]  say this and then now they put out a fake photo they throw the body away and
[52:21.720 --> 52:26.440]  you know instead of handing it over to the nearest mosque you know that was a
[52:26.440 --> 52:30.280]  hobbyist in the area that of course would be the Islamic tradition correctly
[52:30.280 --> 52:54.280]  if I'm wrong sir
[52:54.280 --> 53:01.000]  he was not helpful at all because he was absolutely laid out of the battle so what
[53:01.000 --> 53:05.440]  good is it going to be and now you are telling Taliban once again you were on
[53:05.440 --> 53:08.840]  the right track in a little bit but now you're telling them put down your weapons
[53:08.840 --> 53:14.240]  this is the condition and we will never accept this this is only symbolic it's
[53:14.240 --> 53:18.960]  only psychological boost to the American people if at all and as you said that
[53:18.960 --> 53:24.160]  it may be a boost for Obama's campaign but other than that I can assure you as
[53:24.160 --> 53:28.560]  far as the real matters are concerned we are going to this they are going to be
[53:28.560 --> 53:33.400]  worse than before because Al-Qaeda is not spread out into
[53:33.400 --> 53:39.640]  Morocco what is North Africa into Yemen into Somalia into Chad into many other
[53:39.640 --> 53:45.400]  places so Al-Qaeda is a now growing and phenomena extending phenomena while the
[53:45.400 --> 53:49.440]  American might and their arrogance is a diminishing phenomenon.
[53:49.440 --> 53:54.880]  General Ghoul I mean there's so many points so many questions I have but
[53:54.880 --> 53:59.200]  but but just looking at this I remember you were on six months ago and you said
[53:59.200 --> 54:04.000]  the West has lost the war for the opium for the oil the people are turning
[54:04.000 --> 54:09.200]  against them the Pakistani government will soon order the drones out a week
[54:09.200 --> 54:13.920]  ago they said that's it you must have them out by mid-May that's it and then
[54:13.920 --> 54:18.760]  suddenly this happens I think this timing of this ace in the hole they pulled
[54:18.760 --> 54:23.040]  in this card game what what are the globalist powers that have hijacked the
[54:23.040 --> 54:27.840]  U.S. and England and are trying to destabilize your country what are they
[54:27.840 --> 54:34.760]  how are they planning to use this domestically in Pakistan and what's
[54:34.760 --> 54:38.720]  the sentiment of the Pakistani army dealing with a thousand drones bombing
[54:38.720 --> 54:48.800]  your country I can assure you people of Pakistan are sick and fed up and I think already the
[54:48.800 --> 54:54.800]  limits of our problems have been discussed and I think there is going to be a
[54:54.800 --> 54:58.480]  lot of trouble because lines of communication run through Pakistan of
[54:58.480 --> 55:05.600]  course and if the army is not backing the line of communication and not
[55:05.600 --> 55:09.560]  supporting it not protecting it then I can assure you that it will not work out
[55:09.560 --> 55:14.720]  and I think the battle is lost as far as the Pakistan is concerned Taliban are on
[55:14.720 --> 55:19.200]  the surge this time first of May yesterday they said the operation
[55:19.200 --> 55:22.720]  but there which is a new operation which they are launching the spring offensive
[55:22.720 --> 55:26.800]  and I think there is no way because that will all the battle field it has been
[55:26.800 --> 55:32.600]  lost I am prepared to sit down with any top general of America and discuss with
[55:32.600 --> 55:37.440]  him how do you tell me you are going to win we'll work in it and I can assure you
[55:37.440 --> 55:42.080]  he will lose hands down now at the other point that you were talking about is
[55:42.080 --> 55:47.480]  Pakistan this Pakistan gets disabled stabilized as a result of this and I
[55:47.480 --> 55:52.400]  feel and I suspect and so do the people of Pakistan and the armed forces of
[55:52.400 --> 55:58.880]  Pakistan that American is dark impulse in in America not these all go on
[55:58.880 --> 56:04.400]  not American but let people like Patriots or John Allen or Matt Crystal
[56:04.400 --> 56:11.720]  or they're on and Mike Mullin I think they are out for flashing our nuclear
[56:11.720 --> 56:16.160]  efforts this is not going to happen this is going to be very dangerous because a
[56:16.160 --> 56:21.680]  desperate Pakistan would be a terrible enemy to deal with because Pakistan is
[56:21.680 --> 56:26.880]  not a pushover it's a very large nation it has many abilities it is
[56:26.880 --> 56:34.720]  self-sufficient in food it has a very large army it has it was I've been you
[56:34.720 --> 56:39.200]  know coming up the spirit of the heart is there it has been kindled to to an
[56:39.200 --> 56:45.480]  extent that it cannot be now contained and if it is fueled from outside by
[56:45.480 --> 56:50.640]  aggression then it is going to become a bomb fire and it is going to consume the
[56:50.640 --> 56:55.720]  entire region well that's my next point sir we have Saudi Arabia now running to
[56:55.720 --> 57:00.080]  Pakistan for help cutting oil production because the West is trying to
[57:00.080 --> 57:04.040]  destabilize them as well that's now confirmed trying to manipulate the Arab
[57:04.040 --> 57:08.760]  Spring I mean we could be creeping towards a conflagration many analysts I
[57:08.760 --> 57:13.280]  interview who I respect are saying we are edging towards World War 3 starting
[57:13.280 --> 57:19.440]  in Pakistan if the globalist the dark impulse go ahead with us yeah that's
[57:19.440 --> 57:25.920]  right I think I agree with your assessment and it is all because India and Israel are
[57:25.920 --> 57:32.000]  now writing the policies of America this is very unfortunate that American
[57:32.000 --> 57:36.120]  lives are being lost American money is being squandered all to serve somebody
[57:36.120 --> 57:41.000]  else's interest but this is diabolical and I think this must stop bottom line
[57:41.000 --> 57:45.240]  you are saying from the evidence you have this whole bin Laden killing is a
[57:45.240 --> 58:10.600]  staged event it's just incredible sir other key points about where this is
[58:10.600 --> 58:38.280]  going clearly a propaganda operation any other points general goal general goal
[58:38.280 --> 58:49.760]  stay there for one moment this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network
[58:49.760 --> 58:53.640]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[58:53.640 --> 58:57.960]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[58:57.960 --> 59:02.120]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[59:02.120 --> 59:06.160]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[59:06.160 --> 59:10.080]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[59:10.080 --> 59:14.360]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[59:14.360 --> 59:18.520]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[59:18.520 --> 59:22.840]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[59:22.840 --> 59:26.560]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[59:26.560 --> 59:30.760]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of
[59:30.760 --> 59:34.120]  mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions
[59:34.120 --> 59:37.720]  from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at
[59:37.720 --> 59:43.360]  www.mysolarbackup.com that's my solar backup.com remember the government
[59:43.360 --> 59:51.760]  doesn't own the Sun so go to my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[59:51.760 --> 01:00:06.200]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCN radio network big brother
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:13.440]  mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:21.320]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:27.720]  well you just heard Major General Hamid Ghul former head of Pakistani
[01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:34.440]  intelligence the guy who ran the Taliban with the US government in 1980s
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.960]  telling you he believes it's stage and the evidence pointing that direction no
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:44.120]  kidding we had it from three White House sources one public two secret and then
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.440]  Madeline Albright coming out a year later confirming everything I said about
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:51.200]  him being frozen to be rolled out on Fox News we've broken all of that down
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:56.040]  I mean what more do people even need or want then they have the fake photo they
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.120]  put out of him dead which they knew was fake and had already been put out years
[01:00:59.120 --> 01:01:05.600]  ago as fake media ran with that saying it was real it is absolutely head
[01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:14.760]  spinning head spinning the government was in free fall the public wasn't buying
[01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:19.240]  anything that they were saying or doing the wars a decade later just like
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:24.960]  endless war where's the victories and now you hear the sweet well-meaning good
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:30.600]  old boys all over talk radio it is as if they have entered Valhalla itself they
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:36.560]  are so beside themselves with joy right now now here's the deal I'm gonna open
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:42.880]  the phones up for military people I'm gonna open the phones up for former
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:48.880]  intelligence police media people and that's a wide spectrum but I want to
[01:01:48.880 --> 01:01:53.840]  hear specifically from military folks I mean I I all the talk stations were we
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.840]  only hear from military bases so the local occupations were getting the
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:01.200]  forthood calls and they were just like we got drunkard we've ever gone oh my
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:07.200]  gosh America's back we killed him America's back the dollars dying right
[01:02:07.200 --> 01:02:12.640]  now the Chinese are dumping it gas is $4.20 something cents they say it's
[01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:18.200]  gonna be seven bucks by next year it's all over for the Republic we it's the
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.640]  foreign banksters that are the enemy they're the ones that finance the
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:25.400]  terrorists they're the ones okay I know it's fun to get scared of guys with
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:32.440]  ugly beards and turbans on their heads I don't like to grizzly Adams look even
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:35.800]  though it's been in style here in the US almost every man I know now has beards
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:40.520]  but the point is including my dad I want to shave the thing off I'm not bashing
[01:02:40.520 --> 01:02:43.880]  folks that have beards just that my dad looked like this my whole life and then
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:49.120]  now he's got a beard last year and I'm just like can I see side issue the point
[01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.680]  is I know it's fun to get scared of people I know it's fun to be tribal and
[01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:58.600]  go and go good job but I'm saying glass parking lot kill all the A-Rabbers kill
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:04.280]  them A-Rabbs in Pakistan they're they're Asians folks they're not Arabs I'm
[01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:10.080]  sorry to give you that little news flash it's another part of the world the
[01:03:10.080 --> 01:03:13.960]  government lies incessantly and this whole thing is a giant line we knew it
[01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:17.240]  was coming I want to hear from you and you know what if you think I'm wrong you
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:23.760]  want to call them say listen here buddy boy you may not realize our troops to
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:28.520]  a super good job folks I was told by not one not two but three White House
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:33.360]  sources and then Madeline Albright came out and said the same thing and then
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:38.200]  what Bob Bear the former big CIA guy came out and said it okay it staged it
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:43.960]  staged it staged they put out fake photos it staged but the issue is that
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:50.720]  what are these wars about because now they're telling us in Libya that Al-Qaeda
[01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:56.360]  is good fighting Qaddafi and we got our Bilderberg source Jim Tucker saying of
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.720]  the trilateral Commission meeting with the Bilderbergs were meeting a few weeks
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:03.760]  ago they were hopping mad that the public knew that Al-Qaeda was western run
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:08.800]  and Western funded they are hopping mad about that Al-Qaeda myth falling through
[01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:13.200]  and then now being a big item and talk radio big item in the news so don't
[01:04:13.200 --> 01:04:17.320]  worry oh here's bin Laden plus it's an added boost for Obama and they already
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:20.360]  had a scripted Congressional Medal of Honor thing set up weeks ago for this
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.480]  morning and now it's on every channel and they're mixing it into bin Laden oh
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.680]  look this guy in Korea this guy in Vietnam died when he jumped on a
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:32.880]  hangernator he rushed a machine gun nest and there's Obama no longer than of the
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.680]  evil globalist no he's there with the Congressional Medal pinning and on him
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:43.200]  and I hear good old boys calling talk radio going I love Barry Zatero I thought
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:51.680]  he was bad but he killed bin Laden America's back we don't have to get
[01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:58.320]  rid of the fellow reserve or nothing we kill bin Laden we kill him we kill him

[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:14.760]  pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've turned many
[01:06:14.760 --> 01:06:19.160]  same influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:24.440]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:29.000]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.680]  offshore cartel hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes

[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:41.400]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who to make the check out to
[01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:46.480]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen

[01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:29.080]  my children and my if I had to pay everything to the offshore bankers
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:36.360]  my lucky star they bring in the illegal aliens today and the president's a
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:44.480]  globalist and they can't take that away no they can't because we wrap tyranny
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:56.080]  in the flag to be an American where the TSA sticks their hands down my pants so
[01:08:56.080 --> 01:09:03.520]  the bankers could steal their pension funds next to you and destroy the bill
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:10.920]  of rights today because there ain't no doubt I love the bill to be a group God
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:21.720]  bless the tyranny of the felons across the whole country we got 10 FEMA
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:32.800]  governors from the lakes in Minnesota we put fluoride in your water we're coming
[01:09:32.800 --> 01:09:40.340]  after your guns from the planes of Texas from sea to shining sea from
[01:09:40.340 --> 01:09:49.200]  Detroit down to Houston and New York to America's getting turned into a third
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:56.680]  world country by design yeah and it's fun because we kill bin Laden so everything's
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:58.920]  okay
[01:09:59.920 --> 01:10:06.040]  oh they just showed the Boy Scouts now trying to take on quote disgruntled vets
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:12.320]  who gave that right to me oh really I have the my acumlance credit reports
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:16.840]  where they demonize the founding fathers and the veterans oh and there's the
[01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:20.600]  firefighters on the pile told not to wear their mask because there was
[01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:23.920]  everything was saved or not the government knew and lied because they
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:27.640]  hate them and now the firefighters and police and others have to go through a
[01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:32.200]  terror database just to get their health care that we fought for nine years we
[01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:35.880]  are changing others and I've had the fundraisers the events to get them the
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:43.120]  funding but see that's unpatriotic real patriotism is just is just playing a
[01:10:43.120 --> 01:10:47.640]  song and getting down your knees and letting what the country stands for
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:52.040]  actually be butchered and now supporting a big murderous empire that's
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:11:03.360]  supposed patriotism I love this land God bless the North American Union but
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:07.560]  I'm not supposed to admit that post a wrap at the flag and worship tyranny
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:19.080]  American eagle I mean I'm sorry can we play a clean version of America oh yeah
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:28.680]  that's oh man oh man I can't handle it anymore see here's the deal they know
[01:11:28.680 --> 01:11:32.640]  that this patriotism stuff if it's only skin deep and if you don't have any
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:37.240]  info is a very useful weapon the entire economy is being imploded by design
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:43.240]  right now Obama's approval rating is dropping like a shooting star to record
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:49.160]  levels record Congress is dropping 9% approval rating all over talk radio I
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:52.720]  hear the conservatives going wait a minute mega banks don't pay taxes they
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:58.000]  get all the corporate welfare oh we shouldn't just go after the unions or
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.680]  the other groups with all their entitlements and teaming up with
[01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:05.880]  government to hold people hostage and the welfare moms that's a side issue
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:09.920]  compared to the big mega banks all that are using their regulators to shut down
[01:12:09.920 --> 01:12:14.160]  their competition the system cannot have this and all over the news what al-Qaeda
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.920]  is good there's al-Qaeda and Libya that stuff's true our government's funding
[01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:22.800]  them remember the CFR trilateral Commission meeting they had with a
[01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:26.640]  Bilderberg group steering group that Tucker reported on they are hopping mad
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:30.560]  that people now know about and we're all a locky now I guess number one in Al
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:35.760]  Qaeda since bin Laden officially is dead next they'll tell me that tyrannosaurus
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:41.480]  Rex is officially extinct all of that is going on and remember last night they
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:46.880]  put out the fake bin Laden photo here he is dead and I tend to talk radio people
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:51.800]  were just like even at midnight America look at that dead creature I'm feeling
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:55.880]  good right now those are good well-meaning people they think this guy
[01:12:55.880 --> 01:13:00.160]  did the attack he's now dead they don't know he's a CIA asset frontman with a
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:06.000]  Saudis they're feeling good I don't blame them but it's all a lie then this
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.640]  morning oh that was actually an arduous rendering that was put out three years
[01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:16.040]  ago we knew it was fake but we wanted you to feel good and boost your morale you
[01:13:16.040 --> 01:13:19.640]  won't have any pension funds or any future and they'll they'll butcher the
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:22.800]  bill of rights and Constitution and and get rid of everything that flag
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:27.760]  symbolizes but that's okay because on every channel I could flip to the dial
[01:13:27.760 --> 01:13:35.520]  and I was on Eric Muller's big syndicated show and it was just he was
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:42.640]  playing that under me while I was saying it was an inside job and staged and then
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:48.280]  when I got off I went online and listened and it was just well I know he is CIA and
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:53.080]  they admit Al Qaeda is over in Libya I know he's telling the truth about a
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:58.880]  Loki I did look that up being at the Pentagon but still I just I can't
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:02.880]  believe our government's involved I can't believe I can't believe do you
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:07.280]  remember Bloomberg last year with the headline secret deal signed with
[01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:11.240]  Veterans Affairs to take all death benefits of World War two troops up to
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:14.840]  current serving because you know they give you a form saying would you like a
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:19.320]  part of your check to be taken out that the government will match in some cases
[01:14:19.320 --> 01:14:23.080]  to have an insurance policy and for death benefits if you die a little
[01:14:23.080 --> 01:14:28.000]  supplement to the regular Pentagon death benefits and you say sure and then when
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.400]  it comes time you die of a heart attack cancer or when you're an old man or in
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.720]  the field of battle your widow or widower is sent a form saying just sign
[01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:41.600]  this you'll get your lump sum cash payment of 500 600 million bucks in some
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:47.080]  cases and a little widow who needs that money boy her husband's dead she fills
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:51.800]  out that form and mails it in and she never gets it they were by a secret
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:55.920]  agreement allowed to cheat them as long as they could trick them to sign it oh
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:00.160]  I'm supposed to tell the troops if I see one run up and oh thank you for your
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.680]  service thank you now take all the vaccines they want to give you and let
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.000]  them spray nerve gas on you like Project Shatter have you blow up nerve gas bases
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:13.200]  and then not wear gear or use DU and die because when I support you I just
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:18.080]  write you off and don't care about you it's nothing but propaganda the globalist
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:21.760]  hate our troops you get the internal government documents that we published
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:26.920]  that the government confirmed are real the number one threat is u.s. veterans
[01:15:26.920 --> 01:15:31.800]  returning military they hate you that's why they tell you how much they love you
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:37.960]  all day and rapid and sicky sweet American flags made in China hundreds of
[01:15:37.960 --> 01:15:42.520]  thousands of vets a year they just give them a post traumatic stress disorder
[01:15:42.520 --> 01:15:47.360]  designation they try to go buy a gun and can't get one I'm going to your calls
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.400]  Andrew military Chris California military Robert and Georgia military and
[01:15:51.400 --> 01:15:58.160]  others 1-800-259-9231 I want to hear what you have to say throughout this hour
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:02.560]  Madsen Wayne Madsen just popping in for about 10 minutes later because he's a
[01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:05.880]  great expert on things but just quite frankly from our years of research
[01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:09.280]  there's nobody been a more on top of this than us and I need to go through all
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:13.240]  our research in the in the eyewitnesses and all the White House people we had on
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:17.280]  record this was an inside job that that he was already dead that this was going
[01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:22.040]  to happen and be rolled out just like it has been but Madsen's popping in with
[01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:25.360]  his take and Watson who's really been on top of this Paul Watson popping in
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:29.800]  next hour but I want to go to your phone calls but remember they give you fake
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.600]  photos and try to sell it to you till other media found it and said this was
[01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:37.800]  out three years ago it's fake and they went oh sorry oh yeah and they've got
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:41.680]  the the him up there with the vets to make himself look good standing next to
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:45.480]  the wives of guys that died decades ago in wars and he's up there putting
[01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:48.360]  congressional medal of you know honor you're giving it to the widows to make
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:53.560]  him look good it's all a grandstanding PR event and the former head of the
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:57.760]  Taliban and the al Qaeda when they were quote good our media said I mean ghoul
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:02.360]  was just on and agreed with me general ghoul okay all right let's go to your
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:07.120]  phone calls Andrew in Mississippi you're on the air and I'm not going to say I
[01:17:07.120 --> 01:17:11.160]  appreciate your service I appreciate you joining the military to defend America
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:15.000]  and I do appreciate your service but not in the fake way they say it I don't
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:19.520]  want you to be shot up with shots and nerve-gassed and having your pen your
[01:17:19.520 --> 01:17:23.560]  your insurance you paid for taken it's not an entitlement they're now saying
[01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:27.880]  pensions are entitlements no they're not in the way they say you are entitled
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:32.800]  but I'm sorry what's your take on this Andrew Alex thank you I just want to go
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:36.720]  ahead and say that I second everything you say no you know I just want to stay
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:40.520]  in the military because I don't want a military to be completely comprised of
[01:17:40.520 --> 01:17:43.560]  you know individuals that are complete yes men and won't stand up for the
[01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:48.040]  Constitution so with that being said you know I just wanted to kind of give you
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:53.400]  um you know my viewpoint on you know when I came into base today and you
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.120]  know everybody's smiling ear to ear all they can talk about is the draft and
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:01.120]  which team had the best draft and they're sitting there you know ten years
[01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:06.880]  we finally got on them like you know he was been around a lot longer than ten
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:10.920]  years you know where you know you we were we were funding his uh his attacks
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:13.880]  against Russia you know back when they were the freedom fighters and that in
[01:18:13.880 --> 01:18:20.480]  the 80s and you know you see you give them the stop and you say you know well
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:24.680]  I mean I want them to be gone too but I'm not gonna parade and celebrate his
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:29.040]  death but you know how do we know that this is even authentic and then they're
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:33.760]  like well the president wouldn't have you know broke on the national television
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:38.520]  and you know if it wasn't for sure so they just take everything hook line and
[01:18:38.520 --> 01:18:44.280]  sinker Obama Obama was desperate sinking into quicksand totally imploding
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:48.360]  gas prices going up this will be a nice diversion for him but what about the
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:52.560]  terror hype al-Qaeda is gonna hit us now Andrew we better give all our rights
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:58.480]  up now see now the police state's good because of the al-Qaeda reprisals you
[01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.920]  know it's like everybody's you know no one pays attention anything all they
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.240]  care about is you know the drafts and soon as Osama bin Laden's dead you got
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:10.720]  Facebook status is going off you know you got mass text message everyone all
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.560]  the sudden just you know everything hunky-dory now it's not like the wars
[01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:19.560]  are over but what does this really change well what I don't know how long
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:22.520]  you've been listening but you can go in and find the transcripts the articles
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:27.880]  we're getting the MP3s from 2002 the former number two at the State
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:31.760]  Department came on this show and said he's frozen they're gonna roll him out
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:37.040]  later what do you think of that well I didn't hear that earlier um but I have
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:40.680]  also I've read reports before you know in the past about you know he died in
[01:19:40.680 --> 01:19:44.800]  2001 you know kidney failure and I have seen those reports so I'm kind of

[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:27.160]  article up at info wars dot com and prison planet dot com right now covering

[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:53.400]  say the Washington Post is calling oh and I talked to the Washington Post today
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:25:00.200]  and they're giggling at me about saying that this is all staged I'm gonna read
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:09.720]  to them this spy talk article from 525 10 so that was a year ago now I'm in time
[01:25:09.720 --> 01:25:16.400]  really flies last May 25th and buried the article they're talking to former CIA
[01:25:16.400 --> 01:25:22.400]  section chiefs unnamed but it's spy talk with Jeff Stein and they go on to say
[01:25:22.400 --> 01:25:27.880]  former CIA officials admit to faking bin Laden video well I don't need you to
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:32.000]  later admit you put out fake videos they had university professors experts in
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:37.880]  computer morphing that looked at one and said it was a bad it was the template
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:43.640]  they use in all these animated movies like Final Fantasy and Avatar you see
[01:25:43.640 --> 01:25:46.960]  these video games where everybody looks the same it was even the template remember
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:51.520]  the fat bin Laden it was a video game template they stuck a beard on and the
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:55.520]  mouth was moving I mean it was like something my kids can make literally
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:59.960]  I've got people in my office in hours can make something better now granted this
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:03.240]  was six seven year old you know years ago so it wasn't as good technology but
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:07.720]  and then they had another one where it was him but it was old videos from 99
[01:26:07.720 --> 01:26:12.560]  2000 re-edited they had to admit that later and they had another one where it
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:23.160]  was a darkened room with with an actor I mean I'm sorry folks it's admitted huh I
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:26.960]  just can't handle it anymore I'm sorry Chris Robert Rusty we're going to all
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:32.760]  of you Chris California is military Chris what's your take on this I agree with
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:38.840]  you I but I suspect anything that the government tells me you take the we
[01:26:38.840 --> 01:26:43.800]  have a DNA samples just like paw pot what you do I could I could get DNA
[01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:48.120]  samples of you alive just go and draw blood from you pluck a couple hairs take
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:52.520]  a little tissue sample and then they could confirm that it was me all you
[01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:57.880]  need is cigarette butts or a straw see see the the biggest cells are in your
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:05.760]  mouth and the mucosa cells slough off on a cigarette on a spoon that's how they
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.000]  get DNA in England at roadside checkpoints they just stick a swab in
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:13.440]  your mouth they get hundreds of them I'm sorry go ahead yeah and the where this
[01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:18.920]  took place here it's in an area where all the generals live that all the higher
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:26.480]  ups in Pakistan all live in that area but what I think is if he even if they
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:33.040]  did get him he probably died from his kidney failure and then the peccane
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:36.920]  said okay you come in and take his body and then they flew in there then they
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:40.240]  just whack the rest of the witnesses I mean if they're gonna take out 3,000
[01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:44.080]  people at the World Trade Center what's what's killing another three more
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:47.800]  innocent people well they well last year the Washington post of the headline
[01:27:47.800 --> 01:27:52.760]  drones now targeting no-name terrorists and it said if they have a gun well
[01:27:52.760 --> 01:27:55.960]  everybody's like Texas over there they all got guns we're gonna kill them and
[01:27:55.960 --> 01:28:00.800]  they've said 200 plus dead at a wedding is good collateral damage if they kill
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:06.280]  one quote Taliban al-Qaeda it's just all stage so of course exactly that is
[01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:08.800]  exactly how the Russians have staged some of these events they just whack
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:12.600]  everybody and then dress up dead bodies that's what Hitler did at Gliwitz to
[01:28:12.600 --> 01:28:15.920]  attack Poland they attacked their own military base dressed up concentration
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:20.880]  camp victims in German and Polish uniforms and then put them on newsreels
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:23.800]  they're the dead bodies I've got the newsreels they're public that they
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:27.480]  showed in Germany and that's how he attacked Poland so it's the oldest
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:33.320]  trick in the book but listen I had intel from Pachennik the high-level
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.520]  State Department guy then two White House sources and then Albright came out
[01:28:36.520 --> 01:28:41.680]  on TV it was a big national story and said they're gonna stage this but then
[01:28:41.680 --> 01:28:44.960]  the word was that that scared Bush so they didn't roll him out no for what's
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:52.360]  your take on that my point is sir we're on record saying that exactly this
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:56.800]  would be done and that and that he was on ice from high-level sources one of
[01:28:56.800 --> 01:29:01.120]  them named one of them had them you know what's to come on air and say this
[01:29:01.120 --> 01:29:07.040]  first Steve Pachennik they realized when they whack Kennedy in broad daylight
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:11.560]  that they could get away with anything and they've been doing it ever since you
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:14.960]  know that what you're what you're talking about with another purpose of
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:19.600]  this is to put the mindset that we're gonna face retaliation from this now
[01:29:19.600 --> 01:29:24.640]  about a month ago I heard on a little AP radio blurb on the little radio and it
[01:29:24.640 --> 01:29:28.720]  was hardly there's nothing to it the way it was said was that the State
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:32.360]  Department and Department of Homeland Security says there's a hundred percent
[01:29:32.360 --> 01:29:37.960]  probability that we were gonna face a nuclear attack from terrorists and it's
[01:29:37.960 --> 01:29:42.040]  imminent and then last night on the coast-to-coast show the Sky Hagman said
[01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:45.760]  he read an article that he thought was peculiar in the press telegraph from
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:50.080]  London that said basically the same thing that it's been lost stay there stay
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:55.600]  there match is coming up we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones
[01:29:55.600 --> 01:30:04.960]  and the GCN radio network a very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011 we

[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:36.080]  yeah we're repulling the headlines but about a month ago they came out in
[01:33:36.080 --> 01:33:41.840]  Chicago news and it was it was in a few papers and said yes 160 nukes are buried
[01:33:41.840 --> 01:33:45.880]  in America by al-qaeda inside federal buildings now if you believe that it's
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:51.400]  like saying 160 Easter bunnies with leprechauns are buried in every federal
[01:33:51.400 --> 01:33:55.840]  building just totally ridiculous and then I saw new reports out today that
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.280]  Khalid Sheikh Mohammed this is a guy who's been in custody now almost nine
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:03.960]  years he's confessed to everything he's confessed to bombing buildings that
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:07.880]  weren't built or planning to bomb buildings that weren't built till after
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:12.640]  he was in custody he might as well again confessed to blowing up the
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:19.640]  battleship main in Havana Arbor in 1898 I mean I was well confessed to you know
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:24.880]  making people fall from banana peels 10,000 years ago I mean it's just
[01:34:24.880 --> 01:34:28.480]  asinine and he says there's a nukes buried in Europe in the US and they're
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:32.720]  gonna be detonated now because bin Laden was killed he said if you kill bin
[01:34:32.720 --> 01:34:36.520]  Laden nukes will detonate and you've got the world crisis you've got the global
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:40.200]  military being positioned the Middle East you've got the dollar plunging you've
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:45.640]  got Obama plunging in his approval rating and was this Obama's reelection
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:49.680]  campaign you know the billion bucks he needed the support he needed to look at
[01:34:49.680 --> 01:34:54.960]  like our hero and then bin Laden comes to the rescue the boogeyman comes to the
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:58.880]  rescue every time Bush would talk about the terror threat but a new bin Laden
[01:34:58.880 --> 01:35:02.000]  tape would come out and they'd have linguists listen to it and say that's
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:05.760]  not even somebody from Saudi Arabia that's not even I mean they can tell
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:09.960]  like accents see a linguist knows what a voice sounds like from a certain region
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:15.360]  of China or from a certain region of Brazil not just what a West Texas person
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:20.040]  sounds like everybody's a linguist I mean if you grew up in New York you know
[01:35:20.040 --> 01:35:23.880]  what certain neighborhoods sound like or if you've lived in Texas your whole
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:27.800]  life you know what a Dallas Texas accent sounds like sounds like me this is
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:33.640]  what a Dallas tech old-style North Texas sounds like I mean I can tell when I
[01:35:33.640 --> 01:35:36.960]  can say you're from West Texas aren't you I know what a West Texas sounds like
[01:35:36.960 --> 01:35:41.320]  because I got family and friends West Texas I know what a super southern east
[01:35:41.320 --> 01:35:52.080]  Texas sounds like sounds like a you know French type accent well they have
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:55.360]  linguists listen to it and they go this is not bin Laden or this video is fake
[01:35:55.360 --> 01:36:02.240]  and I just showed you the CIA in the Washington Post last May bragging
[01:36:02.240 --> 01:36:07.840]  bragging and saying yes we made fake bin Laden videos see in case that news
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:11.720]  came out later and was confirmed they said oh yeah we did it so they'll they
[01:36:11.720 --> 01:36:15.560]  issued a fake photo yesterday now they admit it's fake they got rid of the
[01:36:15.560 --> 01:36:20.880]  body we've got all these White House sources saying he was on ice eight nine
[01:36:20.880 --> 01:36:26.880]  years ago including Steve Pacinic who was underneath Kissinger coming out and
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:33.120]  saying this and then I've got the Chicago CBS News threats claim nuclear
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:38.600]  bombs hidden all over u.s. 160 al Qaeda bombs because a letter got sent to the
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:42.640]  government and they run with it like it's real I mean I made the joke we could
[01:36:42.640 --> 01:36:45.960]  get somebody up here with an Arab dialect to claim their bin Laden I got
[01:36:45.960 --> 01:36:49.440]  a guy coming here with a fake beard maybe even a Santa Claus outfit just paint
[01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:55.040]  the Santa Claus beard black and say well bin Laden you're still alive and then
[01:36:55.040 --> 01:36:58.360]  the media might run with it because they're so prime we always hear on a
[01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:01.840]  message board bin Laden said he would do this later it's not confirmed it was
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:05.360]  bin Laden but they run with it that's how you could always tell propaganda we're
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:09.040]  going to Wayne Madsen here in just a moment but I wanted to finish up with
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:12.240]  Chris then we'll go to Robert and Rusty after we talked to Wayne for about ten
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:16.440]  minutes but finishing up Chris a military year you were getting into these
[01:37:16.440 --> 01:37:21.760]  nuke stories suddenly I've been hearing it with no substantiating info nuke sir
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:25.040]  Barry they're gonna nuke you it's a hundred percent the nukes are coming the
[01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:29.040]  nukes are coming the nukes are coming give all your rights up TSA has got to
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:33.440]  stick their hands down your pants you may have a nuke hidden in there finish up
[01:37:33.440 --> 01:37:37.920]  your point there's gentlemen Hagman that was not with George Norrie last night he
[01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:42.200]  said last week he found a peculiar that he read an article stating that if bin
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.920]  Laden was killed that the United States would face a nuclear holocaust and he
[01:37:47.920 --> 01:37:51.480]  just thought it was kind of weird they would put that in there and here it is
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:56.200]  just a week before it happened and it was published in one of the British
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:01.320]  newspapers and guys pull that up pull that up pull that just search if bin
[01:38:01.320 --> 01:38:05.720]  Laden is killed nukes will be detonate detonated KSM I actually have it my
[01:38:05.720 --> 01:38:10.720]  stack up final points yeah and then this thing about the helicopter going down
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:14.760]  to that just went no testing you know today the military the military
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:20.600]  aircraft I used to fly C-130s and the military aircraft is so dependable now
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:25.560]  that they just don't go down on for military aborts you know for mission
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:30.200]  aborts because especially those aircraft that if they were used they were
[01:38:30.200 --> 01:38:33.840]  thoroughly gone over they just don't go down for some that's just something to
[01:38:33.840 --> 01:38:39.320]  say that he we even lost a helicopter during the mission you know make to add
[01:38:39.320 --> 01:38:46.320]  add to the drama look they had 4,000 advisors that died in just the years
[01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:52.000]  right before 9-11 excuse me I'm trying to read articles and talk to you and
[01:38:52.000 --> 01:38:57.480]  remember they had 4,000 people die from 60 to 64 before they even you know
[01:38:57.480 --> 01:39:01.040]  declared someone of an official war after the stage Gulf of Tonkin they could
[01:39:01.040 --> 01:39:05.000]  keep 4,000 dead secret they could keep the Manhattan Project secret with
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:08.200]  hundreds of thousands involved of course they're lying I appreciate your call
[01:39:08.200 --> 01:39:11.320]  folks go well how are they gonna get the military to lie that's that's how this
[01:39:11.320 --> 01:39:15.760]  works or they're compartmentalized on need to know now guys it was actually on
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:21.920]  drudge this morning yeah there it is daily news there but I also have the
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:24.840]  London Telegraph I'm kind of all over the map this is information overload
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:31.640]  folks WikiLeaks nuke hellstorm if Osama is caught or killed and notice that
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:39.440]  conveniently came out last week six days ago conveniently came out on the 25th
[01:39:39.440 --> 01:39:44.480]  Al Qaeda terrorists have threatened to unleash a nuclear hellstorm on the west
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:48.600]  if their leader and the world's most wanted terrorist Osama bin Laden is
[01:39:48.600 --> 01:39:53.480]  nabbed a senior Al Qaeda oh it just came out last week the head of Al Qaeda in
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:59.640]  Pakistan was MI6 Sky News AP oh but just ignore that a senior Al Qaeda commander
[01:39:59.640 --> 01:40:03.680]  has claimed that the terror group has stashed away a nuclear bomb in Europe
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:08.080]  which will be detonated and bin Laden ever is caught or assassinated according
[01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:11.320]  to new top-secret files made public by internet whistleblower WikiLeaks again
[01:40:11.320 --> 01:40:16.640]  backing up the official story let's go to former anti-submarine warfare expert
[01:40:16.640 --> 01:40:21.920]  former NSA officer also worked at the Naval Data Command syndicated journalist
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:26.440]  in studio with us last Wednesday Wayne Madsen back in DC as he prepares to go
[01:40:26.440 --> 01:40:31.880]  on his foreign sojourn and Wayne hearing all of this the fake photo they put out
[01:40:31.880 --> 01:40:38.280]  last night now admitting fake today the fact that that I mean it's the whole
[01:40:38.280 --> 01:40:43.040]  thing that they're not showing the body Wayne Madsen what's your take on this
[01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:46.840]  what are you getting from your DC sources well I gotta say there's more
[01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:51.960]  what's gonna be on the track at Churchill Downs next Saturday during the
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:56.280]  Kentucky Derby there's more of that on the coming out here in Washington than
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:02.600]  I've ever seen what we have here and my sources are telling me that very
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:09.960]  interesting at the linguists and the intelligence analyst at NSA had no
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:16.080]  information no chatter about Osama bin Laden being the target of this
[01:41:16.080 --> 01:41:19.920]  operation before it happened of course after it happened they picked up all
[01:41:19.920 --> 01:41:23.560]  kinds of chatter about bin Laden being killed but these would be the direct
[01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:28.200]  support people to provide provide the intelligence that that Navy field team
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:33.240]  that went in there and supposedly got this guy it looks like this thing has
[01:41:33.240 --> 01:41:39.160]  been spun from whole claws this a botabad is a location of Pakistan's
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:45.000]  version of the West of West Point back in the 80s and when bin Laden was in that
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:49.880]  area of fighting the Soviets on behalf of ISI and CIA during the Mujahideen
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:55.200]  war against the Soviets that area around a botabad was ringed with US and
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:42:02.080]  British signals intelligence stations so why in the world would bin Laden locate
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:06.400]  himself in what is the version of McLean Virginia here with all the retired
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:11.640]  military intelligence sites and it was not unknown to the CIA because the CIA
[01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:16.480]  would go up there and interface with these intelligence people too and you've
[01:42:16.480 --> 01:42:21.640]  got bin Laden sitting in this what they call the mansion and I saw there was a
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:28.200]  ABC news video apparently from a cell phone showing this like ramshackle
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:32.920]  bedroom that looked like an efficiency it had a it had a kitchen off to the side
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:39.200]  with a box of what looked like American sugar one of them jumbo sugar boxes and
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:44.680]  it looked like a crack house yeah it would you know it reminded me of the
[01:42:44.680 --> 01:42:48.480]  remember when they got the Dom out of the spider all and they showed where he
[01:42:48.480 --> 01:42:53.280]  was living eating Doritos and all I look this place up and even mainstream
[01:42:53.280 --> 01:42:57.560]  globalist media admits it is full of military bases the heart of their
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:43:02.640]  intelligence operation that US bases are all over the area both clandestine and
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:08.520]  public and that it's a few hundred yards from a military base and a military
[01:43:08.520 --> 01:43:11.960]  school and so now they're trying to almost blackmail the Pakistanis going
[01:43:11.960 --> 01:43:16.640]  oh look you're with Al Qaeda I mean this gets more and more insane by the minute
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:22.800]  like he'd be hanging out on the edge of a major city I mean this whole thing
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:27.600]  what about them dumping the body in the ocean Wayne all right well we of course
[01:43:27.600 --> 01:43:32.120]  we have no body we're supposed to believe them that they got a hundred
[01:43:32.120 --> 01:43:36.840]  percent DNA identification on the body they said this was done in accordance
[01:43:36.840 --> 01:43:41.720]  in accordance with Islamic religious rights but we've got some Egyptian
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:47.040]  e-moms now saying no it's not in accordance with the Islamic religious
[01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:53.360]  rights and and we've got you know we've got these governments telling us to
[01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:57.360]  believe us that we got the line and we had his body with something to see but
[01:43:57.360 --> 01:44:02.200]  yet the United States is saying that we can't believe Qaddafi who says we
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:06.800]  killed his son and three grandchildren they're saying well we don't have any
[01:44:06.800 --> 01:44:11.400]  verification well we don't have any verification of this where was any there
[01:44:11.400 --> 01:44:17.800]  was no international impartial observers brought in to say okay yeah that that's
[01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:23.360]  been lying we're supposed to believe the same government that just two days ago
[01:44:23.360 --> 01:44:29.000]  Susan Wright said that Libyan troops were taking Viagra and raping Libyan
[01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:33.920]  women when in fact that would be fun as they hope and she said it at the United
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:39.880]  Nations so we've got a long history of yellow cake documents that Viagra to
[01:44:39.880 --> 01:44:44.280]  you know throwing babies out of incubators incubators we've got the oil
[01:44:44.280 --> 01:44:51.000]  from food scandal fake documents the mobile weapons labs that the Dom had I
[01:44:51.000 --> 01:44:55.960]  mean we're supposed to after all and by the way those mobile labs were hydrogen
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:45:01.840]  pumps for running British sold from the 1980 Iran-Iraq war they knew exactly what
[01:45:01.840 --> 01:45:06.040]  they were they'd already been inspected by the UN after the coalition takes over
[01:45:06.040 --> 01:45:11.440]  they run right to hydrogen pumps that the US even uses knowing their hydrogen
[01:45:11.440 --> 01:45:17.000]  18-wheeler backs and say their anthrax labs I mean that is how dumb they think
[01:45:17.000 --> 01:45:21.880]  we are and that's my point they lie lie lie and I'm hearing everybody on talk
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:28.400]  radio just in rapture that America's back everything's great Obama's great man
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:32.920]  he got tough proud to be an American at least I know I'm free these wars are
[01:45:32.920 --> 01:45:36.600]  great why do you think they trigger this now because Obama's approval writing was
[01:45:36.600 --> 01:45:40.600]  in freefall the dollars in freefall that they need a political distraction they
[01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:44.760]  needed a distraction they needed to get people off the first certificate as
[01:45:44.760 --> 01:45:49.720]  old Obama background they needed to furnish his national security credentials
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:54.160]  I think this again proves what I've been writing about is that Obama is
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:46:00.160]  basically a tool a product of the CIA he will do anything they tell him to do you
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:05.000]  know that now now they're saying that he gave the kill order on bin Laden but
[01:46:05.000 --> 01:46:09.680]  we've got somebody from the military saying oh no we would have taken him
[01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:14.040]  alive at he not resist oh and the good old boys are having a fetish attack on
[01:46:14.040 --> 01:46:18.520]  air big I've heard them especially here locally they're going I didn't used to
[01:46:18.520 --> 01:46:23.560]  like Obama but I really like how he gave that kill order oh I'm kind of liking
[01:46:23.560 --> 01:46:27.760]  him right now let's not worry about the banks imploding the government run
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:32.480]  health care the dollar dying the ATF going after the Second Amendment shipping
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:40.000]  guns to Mexico all the crimes oh it's just oh we finally got him I mean this
[01:46:40.000 --> 01:46:44.440]  on the heels of the of the British news admitting the head of al Qaeda in
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:50.360]  Pakistan was MI6 this on the heels of a lock he being at the Pentagon I mean
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:55.600]  this is incredible Wayne and now we're being told that the intelligence that
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:47:02.400]  bin Laden was in a bottle bod came from enhanced interrogation techniques but
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:07.840]  because we tortured these guys they gave him up so this what this does is it is
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:13.120]  the neocons around feet oh yeah you see the torture works when in fact we know
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:17.440]  that most of the people in Guantanamo had no reason to be there they hadn't done
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:21.800]  anything and it's a place to recruit people to be double agents like the
[01:47:21.800 --> 01:47:25.800]  leader of the opposition in Libya known admitted al Qaeda released out of
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:31.440]  Guantanamo Bay to now run the ops others sent from Virginia to run the ops and
[01:47:31.440 --> 01:47:37.960]  at the same time they have been laden in this spook command base of Pakistan with
[01:47:37.960 --> 01:47:44.080]  U.S. operatives all over the place as if this 6 foot 4 you know Arab is going to
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:47.480]  be living for years the middle of a city I mean next they're going to tell us
[01:47:47.480 --> 01:47:52.720]  that they found Elvis in the compound well that's true and maybe Bob Marley and
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:58.000]  Jim Morrison along with them but I'm telling you that everything I heard
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:03.200]  from many different intelligence sources it said that bin Laden died several years
[01:48:03.200 --> 01:48:09.360]  ago now whether he died I mean the question is he died violently in
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:14.800]  Pakistan as indicated by Benazir Budo the late prime minister I also had
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:19.280]  intelligence that he escaped after he left Torah Bore he went back to Yemen as
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:25.280]  the ancestral homeland and died of kidney disease so I mean the mere fact is
[01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:29.320]  that many many intelligence sources around the world have already stated
[01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:34.200]  up front that bin Laden was dead and all these video and audio tapes were fake
[01:48:34.200 --> 01:48:39.200]  and you know they put these things out through this search for
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:43.680]  international terrorist entity site group here in Washington which is a
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:47.600]  no-mose thought operation and then they would feed that stuff directly to the
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:53.920]  government and this the corporate media outlets I want to repeat the points you
[01:48:53.920 --> 01:48:58.800]  just made I don't want to just glaze over this when you say that Washington
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:02.640]  Post last May admitted that the government created the fake bin Laden
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:08.040]  videos earlier I actually read those headlines here former CIA officials
[01:49:08.040 --> 01:49:13.640]  admit to faking bin Laden video here's the Washington Post May 25th 2010 so
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:19.360]  a little little less than a year ago it's buried in a CIA units wacky idea to
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:23.200]  pick Saddam is gay they didn't make that fake video but they're going to say we
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:28.920]  did make fake bin Laden videos now continuing with all of this what about
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:33.040]  the fake photo they start running at 10 o'clock last night ahead of Obama's
[01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:37.040]  speech Obama gives the speech a little bit later so newspapers didn't have time
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:40.920]  to check it right before they go to print that the new suddenly a photo is
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:45.360]  given to them it's in papers all over the world of the dead bin Laden and then
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:48.480]  alternative media points out hey this photo was out three years ago it's fake
[01:49:48.480 --> 01:49:52.400]  and they go oopsie I mean they think we're so dumb they want to give the
[01:49:52.400 --> 01:49:57.040]  slaves the image of the bad guy they run this fake photo I mean they've been
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:02.120]  caught red-handed and then I've had Steve Pachennick the number two guy under
[01:50:02.120 --> 01:50:06.520]  Kissinger admit that he knew bin Laden work with bin Laden coming on the air in
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:11.760]  April of 2002 saying he's dead he's been frozen they'll roll him out whenever
[01:50:11.760 --> 01:50:15.520]  they want maybe a year maybe ten years boom and then I've got Madeline
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:20.160]  Albright two years later going on TV and saying they may roll him out he's
[01:50:20.160 --> 01:50:23.440]  been frozen in the election of they need him but because she said that they
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:27.200]  didn't then I have two other White House sources high-level told me this this is
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:34.240]  an open secret Wayne that he died and is frozen right I believe he died he died
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:38.360]  somewhere and he hasn't been he hasn't been with the living for a number of
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:42.920]  years and I I've been waiting also for this time when they would make it an
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:47.680]  official that he was dead because now the number two guy in charge of al-Qaeda
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:52.440]  his name he's an American name Adam Perlman Jewish kid from Los Angeles but
[01:50:52.440 --> 01:50:55.920]  have you heard anybody talk about who the new number two guy is no no stay
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:59.080]  there stay there I want to talk about what this signifies why they did this

[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:23.600]  of the bin Laden announcement when they were just saying Obama will make the
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:28.000]  announcement and my phone began ringing off the hook you have these
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:33.600]  spontaneous democratic supporters with crisp American flags showing up in the
[01:54:33.600 --> 01:54:39.680]  hundreds to worship Obama our great hardcore leader now we have people
[01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:44.600]  spontaneously reportedly putting flowers at Bush's mansion in Dallas
[01:54:44.600 --> 01:54:51.200]  President Bush worshipping him for saving us you have basically repeats of
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:56.200]  Chalabi the globalist frontman in the fake pulldown of the Saddam statue where
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:55:01.280]  the national news only showed up close later photos got released it was like
[01:55:01.280 --> 01:55:05.520]  20 people around the statue but they said hundreds of thousands are there
[01:55:05.520 --> 01:55:10.520]  they pulled down the statue basically we've all seen Baghdad Bob up there
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:14.000]  saying the Americans are not invading the city as you can see explosions behind
[01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:18.680]  him our government does the same kind of stuff they just get away with it they
[01:55:18.680 --> 01:55:24.360]  never get in trouble for it and this whole thing is a giant disgusting
[01:55:24.360 --> 01:55:27.920]  scyop there you notice the last month though they've been if bin Laden gets
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:32.600]  killed Al Qaeda is going to hit we saw WikiLeaks put that out AP put that out
[01:55:32.600 --> 01:55:37.200]  there's 160 nukes buried in America totally ridiculous that's like saying
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:42.200]  there's 160 leprechauns you know at the end of rainbows but they are really
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:46.200]  getting everybody ready with the same preparatory fear mongering I saw before
[01:55:46.200 --> 01:55:51.800]  9-11 when are they getting ready to stage new terror attacks Taliban commander
[01:55:51.800 --> 01:55:56.200]  vows to have been been laden in America now we've got to let the TSA stick their
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:00.600]  hands down six-year-old pants or Al Qaeda will get us Wayne oh well that's
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.600]  what we're that's what we're hearing you know people are saying well now can we
[01:56:03.600 --> 01:56:08.080]  bring our troops home from Iraq and Afghanistan and we you know get rid of
[01:56:08.080 --> 01:56:11.360]  the Patriot agates and oh no we need this stuff more now than other because
[01:56:11.360 --> 01:56:17.200]  they never because we're going to be retaliated against by by Al Qaeda and you
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:22.240]  know I put I also would point out remember Bush they was asked about bin
[01:56:22.240 --> 01:56:26.280]  Laden I've been lying I'm not I'm not worried about bin Laden I mean it was
[01:56:26.280 --> 01:56:30.680]  clear even Bush said he wasn't even worried about this guy after a couple of
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:35.360]  years he was an afterthought well I guess the corpse would be an afterthought
[01:56:35.360 --> 01:56:41.800]  to the president but I think there's been line is the Immanuel Goldstein of
[01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:47.440]  reality like it like Immanuel Goldstein was always pointed to by big
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:53.120]  brother in the novel 1984 he's the enemy and we almost have to we all have to
[01:56:53.120 --> 01:56:59.240]  rally against the enemy and of course the enemy was a fake and so after 10
[01:56:59.240 --> 01:57:03.440]  years of war coming up now we get to feel good the war is going to continue
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:07.480]  even if they hit us so what you know we're fighting them and we see endless
[01:57:07.480 --> 01:57:12.880]  video of Bush on the rubble pile with his promise that we're gonna come get you
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:16.040]  dead or alive whoever knocked these towers down we're coming to get you
[01:57:16.040 --> 01:57:21.200]  meanwhile it turns out he ordered Nora to stand down through Cheney I mean this
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:27.800]  is so disgusting a way of legitimizing ten years of Empire right as the
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:31.640]  American people start to wake up to it well I like another thing is they're
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:35.920]  setting the stage for the 10th anniversary of 9-11 in September and we
[01:57:35.920 --> 01:57:39.840]  can see it now how this is going to play out you know what we finally got got
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:45.120]  bin Laden and we have to remember Bob Mueller the head of the FBI stated that
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:50.240]  there was not no indication that bin Laden had anything that he's not on the
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:54.680]  FBI most wanted listed never was but a lackey who was on one of the list he
[01:57:54.680 --> 01:57:57.480]  gets to hang out the Pentagon and we'll talk about in the last five minutes
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:01.320]  with you then calls the next little five minutes we'll talk about the future of
[01:58:01.320 --> 01:58:04.680]  this but I want to go out to break here here's a clip of Bush saying I don't
[01:58:04.680 --> 01:58:08.480]  care where bin Laden is why do I care here it is so I don't know where he is
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:11.640]  nor do you know I just don't spend that much time on him and let me be honest with
[01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:16.200]  you I'm I'm more worried about making sure that our soldiers are well supplied
[01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:22.600]  that the strategy is clear that the coalition is strong that when we so
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:27.600]  there you go it ends abruptly so he's not worried about bin Laden in fact let's
[01:58:27.600 --> 01:58:31.800]  go out to break with that with let's play it one more time you over the music
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:36.680]  let's hide if in fact he's hiding at all so I don't know where he is nor do you
[01:58:36.680 --> 01:58:41.640]  know I just don't spend that much time on it and let me be honest with you
[01:58:41.640 --> 01:58:51.920]  you are listening to GCN visit GCNLive.com today this is Alex Jones with
[01:58:51.920 --> 01:58:55.680]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:59.440]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:03.960]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:08.200]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[01:59:08.200 --> 01:59:12.800]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:59:12.800 --> 01:59:16.800]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:21.160]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is
[01:59:21.160 --> 01:59:24.880]  always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:59:24.880 --> 01:59:29.040]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:59:29.040 --> 01:59:32.600]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the

[02:00:20.040 --> 02:00:29.160]  Alex Jones we're back live the Atlantic and others are attacking me Jeffrey
[02:00:29.160 --> 02:00:37.800]  Goldberg the warp speed rise of deatherism and they're quoting my
[02:00:37.800 --> 02:00:44.360]  interviews here with high-level globalists CFR members that bin Laden was
[02:00:44.360 --> 02:00:51.200]  dead many many years ago nine years ago nine plus years ago and now you notice
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:56.360]  that Panetta is leaving last week they announced leaving the CIA to go to the
[02:00:56.360 --> 02:01:01.680]  Pentagon Petraeus to fix intelligence is going to the CIA and Panetta is the big
[02:01:01.680 --> 02:01:07.440]  hero man they did this they took out bin Laden this could not be more stage and
[02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:11.760]  they're also positioning Petraeus for the presidential run let's talk about
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:16.080]  that and then also the the the al-Qaeda commanders and we're all the walkie they
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:21.680]  tell us is number two but also number two is Adam Gadan former mr. Perlman his
[02:01:21.680 --> 02:01:25.760]  daddy ran a granddaddy around the ADL he was arrested once for beating up
[02:01:25.760 --> 02:01:30.360]  Muslims outside mosque he hated him so much but then he joined al-Qaeda so he
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:35.120]  could be the pretext to put out videos uploaded in the same video layer as the
[02:01:35.120 --> 02:01:39.400]  Intel Center video showing them they're the ones putting it out I mean this is
[02:01:39.400 --> 02:01:45.560]  some bold psyopsis it not oh absolutely and you know I mean Panetta who was not
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:49.960]  really like that the CIA yes this is but the big feather and old Joe Camel
[02:01:49.960 --> 02:01:58.880]  Pat there when he goes over to the Pentagon yeah yeah there's too many
[02:01:58.880 --> 02:02:04.120]  things that involved with this you know so they decided that they had to be I
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:10.760]  guess defrost bin Laden and but but look nobody got an eyeball on his body
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:17.280]  like I say the there was nothing on NSA intercepts and they have that area well
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:21.320]  covered indicating there was an operation going on to get bin Laden
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:26.120]  Obama tries to say well we weren't sure but I authorized this when we had good
[02:02:26.120 --> 02:02:30.960]  intelligence I mean who's he fooling he hasn't he doesn't tell the truth about
[02:02:30.960 --> 02:02:36.080]  anything it if President Obama told me it was a nice day I'd have to you know
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:41.480]  put my head out the window and get my own opinion of that but but now I see
[02:02:41.480 --> 02:02:45.120]  that they're trying to spin this NSA story because now they're saying what
[02:02:45.120 --> 02:02:49.560]  got NSA interested in that particular house was the fact there were no cell
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:54.040]  phones or any communications coming out of there like all the other houses in the
[02:02:54.040 --> 02:02:57.440]  area and that's why they thought it was suspicious so it looks like they're
[02:02:57.440 --> 02:03:01.680]  trying to cover cover themselves by saying it was a communication dead
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:06.120]  zone just in that one house it turned out to be that's supposedly where bin
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:13.160]  Laden was saying so you've got the same breakdown I mean there I knew it as soon
[02:03:13.160 --> 02:03:16.400]  as I heard it last night but today Alcatraz about to hit give all your
[02:03:16.400 --> 02:03:20.320]  rights up never mind the foreign banks looting you the dollar dying gas prices
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:24.600]  we killed bin Laden but we got to take all your rights because they're about to
[02:03:24.600 --> 02:03:29.600]  retaliate oh I think so I think this is it would you know they're just playing
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:33.480]  they're playing everybody in this country and elsewhere I mean did you see
[02:03:33.480 --> 02:03:37.200]  Tony Blair was on there patting him right he almost broke his arm patting
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:42.880]  himself on the back saying this was a great thing and I mean you know this
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:47.840]  both the liars are out in force right now because they've seen this great
[02:03:47.840 --> 02:03:54.000]  Psyopsis great wag the dog Hollywood made feature come to the small screen

[02:04:08.720 --> 02:04:13.200]  incredible evidence of how ridiculous this is but as Joseph Goebbels said good
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:18.920]  effective propaganda is simple and something that people want to buy into
[02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:23.440]  and you know who likes us I'm a bin Laden so it's oh my gosh he's dead
[02:04:23.440 --> 02:04:29.680]  in that great this is so ridiculous and it's also frightening it signifies the
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:34.400]  escalation in events that we're now entering do you agree oh absolutely I
[02:04:34.400 --> 02:04:39.240]  think and I agree that we may see the worst yet to come with the all this

[02:08:45.880 --> 02:08:51.800]  yesterday we have teresa hines carry coming out in 2003 for saying the word
[02:08:51.800 --> 02:08:56.760]  washington was he was dead and frozen we have
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:02.080]  walter kronkite coming out and saying it then madeline all bright on fox news
[02:09:02.080 --> 02:09:06.600]  and cnn we have the mainstream news articles about that we're trying to
[02:09:06.600 --> 02:09:09.520]  ferret out the video I played the video at the time it's around here somewhere
[02:09:09.520 --> 02:09:13.760]  but we've got the articles with her quotes but remember where you heard it
[02:09:13.760 --> 02:09:21.600]  first Steve put chinnick cfr member author and former deputy secretary of
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:26.080]  state under kissinger who worked with bin laden from his own words saying he's
[02:09:26.080 --> 02:09:30.040]  frozen they're gonna roll him out in the future maybe a year maybe 10 years well
[02:09:30.040 --> 02:09:33.800]  we now know it's almost in that article the transcript we're trying to dig out
[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:38.200]  the mp3 we've saved all our shows but haven't kept very good records if you
[02:09:38.200 --> 02:09:44.680]  can find the interview from the date it's got the date of it in april 2002 over
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:49.320]  nine years ago council and farm relations member steven are but chinnick it's in
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:52.880]  the article inside source bin laden's corpse has been on ice for nearly a
[02:09:52.880 --> 02:09:56.160]  decade we had general homie ghoul former head of what you could call
[02:09:56.160 --> 02:09:59.720]  taliban and al-qaeda back when our media said they were great on saying he
[02:09:59.720 --> 02:10:03.600]  believes it's a hoax what was the exact quote he said part of a fable part of
[02:10:03.600 --> 02:10:10.560]  make believe chris robert rusty paul others i'd really appreciate you holding
[02:10:10.560 --> 02:10:20.040]  is andrew first john so robert is first robert in georgia robert you're on the
[02:10:20.040 --> 02:10:30.200]  air hey alex hey okay so i used to work at a secret government base it was a it
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:36.320]  was a artillery fire base type thing it was literally a hundred yards from what
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:42.360]  they call atomic any any have you heard of that thing tell us about it atomic
[02:10:42.360 --> 02:10:48.120]  any is the only artillery fire to fire atomic missiles it's a frog it's a
[02:10:48.120 --> 02:10:54.120]  tactical nook yes yeah yeah well what they were meant to do with they they
[02:10:54.120 --> 02:11:02.300]  were gonna set up a whole border upon like the ussr border back in the the
[02:11:02.300 --> 02:11:06.680]  seventies and they were just kind of pirate these things like mad it's to
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:12.560]  knock out the 10 to 1 superiority of the russian armor basically yeah yeah it
[02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:18.480]  was to it because i mean i know what the artillery fired nukes are i just i had
[02:11:18.480 --> 02:11:21.760]  forgotten the name atomic and yes i know about it go ahead oh yeah i mean it
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:25.320]  was the it's the only one that's still on display it's almost on display like
[02:11:25.320 --> 02:11:32.480]  okay so anyways we had uh we had been holding tactical fire defenses against
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:44.040]  against uh i mean the eastern asian period for a long time and also against
[02:11:44.040 --> 02:11:50.360]  the equator and there's a lot of like i mean pakistan was one of our main
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:55.280]  targets we used to we used to practice every single day shooting down pakistan
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:12:04.040]  with nukes and i mean that's just once i saw it come out today i mean bush had
[02:12:04.040 --> 02:12:10.080]  this thing lined up and he gave it up because he he did the whole mission
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:15.000]  accomplished thing and he kind of put egg on his face so well that's what
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:18.320]  homie and ghoul said he said that it looks like they're creeping towards a
[02:12:18.320 --> 02:12:23.760]  full-on attack and snatching the nukes of pakistan because Saudi Arabia has been
[02:12:23.760 --> 02:12:26.800]  running to them for help and i'm telling you folks this is world war three
[02:12:26.800 --> 02:12:30.720]  type developments that are lining up anything else that you'd like to add
[02:12:30.720 --> 02:12:38.840]  sir oh yeah yeah i mean i india and pakistan are two opposing nations and
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:44.240]  we have taken the side of india and we are going to take the side of india and
[02:12:44.240 --> 02:12:49.680]  so that means we're gonna we're gonna go all out so i appreciate your call yeah
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:52.120]  those two have been on the verge of war with each other i could tell you didn't
[02:12:52.120 --> 02:12:57.080]  want talking about classified things but really none of that's a secret i just
[02:12:57.080 --> 02:13:01.720]  wasn't where they were planning to use artillery i've seen the footage of out
[02:13:01.720 --> 02:13:06.840]  in the nevada them testing the big artillery firing nukes and you see the
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:13.320]  big rail loaded artillery it's on rail fire it recoils hundreds of feet boom
[02:13:13.320 --> 02:13:18.760]  rolls back and then you wait a few seconds and you see mushroom cloud five
[02:13:18.760 --> 02:13:24.520]  miles away very powerful all right let's and david crockett's and all the rest of
[02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:28.920]  that's a two-man team weapon let's go ahead and i wanted to go to rusty but
[02:13:28.920 --> 02:13:32.200]  he just hung up toll free number for military and others to give us their
[02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:36.600]  take on this eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one eight hundred two
[02:13:36.600 --> 02:13:40.200]  five at nine nine two thirty one if you buy all this if you think they killed
[02:13:40.200 --> 02:13:44.440]  bin laden and the dollar saved you love obama now the bankers are good federal
[02:13:44.440 --> 02:13:48.600]  reserves fine nothing to worry about the wars are great they killed him you
[02:13:48.600 --> 02:13:51.240]  know it's miller time i'd like to hear from you as well
[02:13:51.240 --> 02:13:54.440]  eight hundred two five nine ninety two thirty one
[02:13:54.440 --> 02:13:57.240]  or if you don't like him putting out a fake photo of him dead last night
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:00.360]  knowingly and feel like that's suspicious for them not showing you the body
[02:14:00.360 --> 02:14:05.000]  suspicious or all these top people six seven eight nine years ago coming out
[02:14:05.000 --> 02:14:08.920]  saying he was on ice it was staged but see you thought it'd be bush doing it
[02:14:08.920 --> 02:14:12.360]  for political purposes these people work for the same corporate
[02:14:12.360 --> 02:14:18.040]  interest obama bush it's all staged remember bush saying i like obama
[02:14:18.040 --> 02:14:22.040]  after he was leaving office he was president uh
[02:14:22.040 --> 02:14:26.840]  elect still or currently in but president elect obama was about to come in
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:30.040]  and he's like he won't complain when the depression hits and everything bad
[02:14:30.040 --> 02:14:35.400]  happens he won't say uh poor me uh poor me remember that clip
[02:14:35.400 --> 02:14:38.440]  it's all a big joke and i'm not going to be suckered by it
[02:14:38.440 --> 02:14:42.280]  paul in texas you're on the air
[02:14:43.080 --> 02:14:47.240]  what about what about the fact that they say that uh they had the intel nine
[02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:53.480]  months ago uh on this compound uh but osama bin laden is supposedly the one
[02:14:53.480 --> 02:14:57.240]  who killed uh you know thousands in the trade center
[02:14:57.240 --> 02:15:01.080]  yet he's he's in the same location for over nine months
[02:15:01.080 --> 02:15:04.840]  it sounds like a guy who's you know really worried about getting caught as
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:08.520]  opposed to someone like sidam who's saying who
[02:15:08.520 --> 02:15:13.000]  supposedly didn't sleep in the same place you know in the same night that he
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.160]  sleep there in one well that's right and and and pakistan is overrun in fact i
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:19.720]  was reading that in the ap in fact i'll try to dig it out
[02:15:19.720 --> 02:15:23.560]  or or or you guys search it because i'll never find it in the 50 or so articles
[02:15:23.560 --> 02:15:28.440]  search uh attack on bin laden compound called off nine months ago because i
[02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:31.480]  did read that and they also said a month ago
[02:15:31.480 --> 02:15:35.000]  they were going to bomb it with a whole bunch of stealth bombers with 2 000
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:39.400]  pound bombs but they didn't want to hurt people in nearby buildings
[02:15:39.400 --> 02:15:43.160]  they have an open policy if we can kill hundreds of innocent people to kill one
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:46.680]  bad guy but oh to get bin laden
[02:15:46.680 --> 02:15:50.120]  we didn't want to hurt the neighbors i mean does anyone
[02:15:50.120 --> 02:15:53.800]  exactly nine months on the edge of a major city
[02:15:53.800 --> 02:15:59.080]  military bases all around it and nobody knew osama bin laden folks
[02:15:59.080 --> 02:16:04.360]  i've been with movie stars in austin texas uh in california in other areas
[02:16:04.360 --> 02:16:07.240]  just because here they call up they want me to come visit with them we you know
[02:16:07.240 --> 02:16:10.120]  we become friends they come visit me whatever
[02:16:10.120 --> 02:16:14.440]  and people notice them through tinted windows
[02:16:14.440 --> 02:16:18.040]  they decided to go in a gas station to use the bathroom by the time they come
[02:16:18.040 --> 02:16:21.160]  back out your pump and gas 20 cars are there
[02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:25.560]  there's nobody with more you know visual globally known except for like a
[02:16:25.560 --> 02:16:29.640]  george bush of iraq obama a elvis obama uh uh uh
[02:16:29.640 --> 02:16:34.280]  some of bin laden i mean does anyone believe this and then he kept putting
[02:16:34.280 --> 02:16:38.120]  out addresses in the same turbine the same beard so he's
[02:16:38.120 --> 02:16:40.920]  that makes us believe he hadn't gotten plastic surgery
[02:16:40.920 --> 02:16:44.840]  but then those are fake they then admit that stuff is from 99 2000
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:48.040]  recut or it's fake and then they admit it's fake
[02:16:48.040 --> 02:16:51.880]  they admittedly lie to us constantly and say they killed him nine times
[02:16:51.880 --> 02:16:56.840]  what do you say to that paul that's ridiculous and it just goes into if
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:17:00.920]  you're really trying to elude and and evade
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:04.520]  capture are you really going to stay in the same place for nine months
[02:17:04.520 --> 02:17:07.720]  are you going to be you know you're going to be constantly he would have a nose
[02:17:07.720 --> 02:17:13.720]  job he would uh be uh wearing uh western clothes
[02:17:13.720 --> 02:17:17.560]  he would look nothing like it he'd wear blue contacts
[02:17:17.560 --> 02:17:21.160]  he'd have his ears fixed this is what the cia does it's
[02:17:21.160 --> 02:17:25.640]  asinine a six foot four six foot six look up how tall he is
[02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:28.840]  that's big for the you know those folks giant guy
[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:35.160]  who can oh man i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry sir anything else
[02:17:35.160 --> 02:17:38.920]  yeah what about donald trump and uh or trump holdings and uh
[02:17:38.920 --> 02:17:42.040]  and the purchase of black water have you heard anything about that
[02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:45.560]  no but i mean donald trump is as dirty as a
[02:17:45.560 --> 02:17:49.000]  speaking of bathrooms as a side of the road uh you know
[02:17:49.000 --> 02:17:53.720]  711 bathroom i mean i i just don't know what i mean it's but it's all about
[02:17:53.720 --> 02:17:57.400]  the hype i tried to go see his address and turned it on and it was the
[02:17:57.400 --> 02:18:00.680]  apprentice that i never seen with all these people posing
[02:18:00.680 --> 02:18:04.360]  and acting weird and then the president cuts in it's all
[02:18:04.360 --> 02:18:08.600]  theater i appreciate your call it is all a hundred percent theater
[02:18:08.600 --> 02:18:11.240]  we're gonna go to break and come back with paul joseph watson with key intel
[02:18:11.240 --> 02:18:16.120]  breakdown from prisonplanet.com eric in virginia you're on the air
[02:18:16.120 --> 02:18:19.800]  hey uh alec how you doing uh long time missing the first time caller
[02:18:19.800 --> 02:18:25.400]  i just wanted to uh call in and say i'm x army uh i remember about a month after
[02:18:25.400 --> 02:18:30.680]  9-11 occurred i was sent through pakistan and uh our mission was to
[02:18:30.680 --> 02:18:34.920]  provide support for the cia who were operating the drone planes
[02:18:34.920 --> 02:18:39.800]  and now i'm looking at uh news articles that on cnn and c span
[02:18:39.800 --> 02:18:44.200]  and they're suggesting that oh well pakistan was
[02:18:44.200 --> 02:18:49.560]  hiding osama bin laden uh you know they're assisting in him trying not to
[02:18:49.560 --> 02:18:53.720]  be captured and i just think that's bogus because the whole time i was there
[02:18:53.720 --> 02:18:57.080]  that was the whole mission was to find him within pakistan
[02:18:57.080 --> 02:19:01.160]  and pakistan was helping you uh because i've talked to other soldiers but they
[02:19:01.160 --> 02:19:04.520]  said that they would tell you you're in an area u.s troops have never been there
[02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:10.280]  would be graffiti mre's shell casings uh laying around then you'd
[02:19:10.280 --> 02:19:13.800]  meet buddies later who'd been there a month before it was all part of a media
[02:19:13.800 --> 02:19:17.960]  show is that your take uh well yeah of course it is definitely
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:21.240]  my take they definitely manipulate everything through the media another thing
[02:19:21.240 --> 02:19:23.800]  too while i was there uh providing support
[02:19:23.800 --> 02:19:27.480]  we would do things uh as far as uh burning trash and uh
[02:19:27.480 --> 02:19:30.760]  burning uh waste that we produced while we were there
[02:19:30.760 --> 02:19:34.440]  and we worked side by side with pakistan's soldiers
[02:19:34.440 --> 02:19:37.960]  and there's a big misconception out there saying oh
[02:19:37.960 --> 02:19:41.160]  the uh muslim religion they don't want you to see their wives they want to
[02:19:41.160 --> 02:19:44.600]  cover them up well these guys were by my age early 20s and
[02:19:44.600 --> 02:19:47.800]  they were eager to show me their wife they were really eager into
[02:19:47.800 --> 02:19:51.560]  knowing about american culture and the whole misconception of this
[02:19:51.560 --> 02:19:55.480]  is this bogus though it is there that they bring in the radical muslims
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:58.760]  to kick out the non-radicals that's the whole plan
[02:19:58.760 --> 02:20:02.520]  look what they're doing to qaddafi with al-qadr right now hi this is alex jones

[02:24:46.920 --> 02:24:52.200]  bin laden killed yesterday baloney i don't buy the fake photo they put out
[02:24:52.200 --> 02:24:55.560]  and later admitted was fake i don't buy the buried at sea
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:59.480]  i i've got all the inside intel sources some of them public
[02:24:59.480 --> 02:25:02.680]  highest level of government telling me this was fake
[02:25:02.680 --> 02:25:06.280]  nine years ago yeah you better believe i don't buy it
[02:25:06.280 --> 02:25:10.920]  but here's another issue last week within hours of the birth certificate the
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:14.360]  long form coming out we had our photoshop experts look
[02:25:14.360 --> 02:25:18.840]  at it yes we know in the particular program
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:23.080]  that we were in that it separates layers out that's not our point we mentioned
[02:25:23.080 --> 02:25:27.000]  that and that the computer saw the faked areas the
[02:25:27.000 --> 02:25:30.920]  faked letters for itself and now a lot of other
[02:25:30.920 --> 02:25:34.600]  digital experts four or five days later are figuring this out
[02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:39.320]  our video now has close to 600 000 views with the proof that it's a fraud
[02:25:39.320 --> 02:25:43.240]  here's world net daily online birth certificate document was changed
[02:25:43.240 --> 02:25:47.800]  and basically what you find is there are typewritten letters
[02:25:47.800 --> 02:25:50.760]  and with a typewriter every letter is different because the ink
[02:25:50.760 --> 02:25:55.160]  even though the metal stamper is the same the way the ink is applied and is
[02:25:55.160 --> 02:25:58.120]  laid down the way you hit the key how much ink
[02:25:58.120 --> 02:26:03.720]  it had the way it slaps the paper where the paper is in its roll
[02:26:03.720 --> 02:26:08.840]  is the paper lined up properly everyone is unique like a snowflake the way it
[02:26:08.840 --> 02:26:13.400]  stamps and splatters these have been blown up like we said last week
[02:26:13.400 --> 02:26:17.960]  and there are letters that are identical in different lines from the
[02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:24.200]  supposed same typewriter that's impossible the pixels are identical
[02:26:24.200 --> 02:26:28.360]  it's fake okay and it's just common sense
[02:26:28.360 --> 02:26:32.360]  then we blow up the birth certificate the one the white house put out now
[02:26:32.360 --> 02:26:36.040]  there's two other versions of the same thing but with different stamps and
[02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:39.320]  things on it i mean this is meant to be a debate this is meant to be a
[02:26:39.320 --> 02:26:42.120]  distraction
[02:26:42.200 --> 02:26:45.400]  because they don't want it debated too long the more time goes by the more
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:48.520]  folks don't buy it so you're on to the next
[02:26:48.520 --> 02:26:52.280]  hoax which has been lied and killed and by the time that info comes out that
[02:26:52.280 --> 02:26:55.400]  it's a hoax there'll be the next hoax this is high tech
[02:26:55.400 --> 02:26:58.760]  scyop but it was designed to get a debate going
[02:26:58.760 --> 02:27:02.520]  and then discredit those that were trying to expose the fraud
[02:27:02.520 --> 02:27:06.360]  but the areas that have been altered don't have pixels
[02:27:06.360 --> 02:27:10.840]  that are have artifacts because it's new and high res
[02:27:10.840 --> 02:27:14.040]  the areas that are the original photo scan
[02:27:14.040 --> 02:27:17.800]  have the pixels everywhere so you can see it even in its
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:22.520]  native layers that it's different areas that have been
[02:27:22.520 --> 02:27:26.600]  doctored it was done very shortly
[02:27:27.320 --> 02:27:30.840]  and now world net daily as this computer document expert who analyzed online
[02:27:30.840 --> 02:27:33.880]  images of barock's purported certificate of live birth for world net daily
[02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:37.000]  confirmed there are anomalies inconsistent with simple scanning
[02:27:37.000 --> 02:27:39.800]  process and there is evidence that it's been manipulated but there's no way
[02:27:39.800 --> 02:27:42.760]  to determine exactly what may have been modified
[02:27:42.760 --> 02:27:47.080]  uh not true uh just look listen with typewriters you don't have the exact
[02:27:47.080 --> 02:27:52.200]  same pixel layout per word per letter okay because it
[02:27:52.200 --> 02:27:56.600]  goes off the gradient color and that's what affects
[02:27:56.600 --> 02:28:00.040]  the point is it's a fraud all right let's go to watts and we're going to break
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:03.480]  here in a minute watch them but give us a i've been all over the map i'm so
[02:28:03.480 --> 02:28:07.400]  overwhelmed by this uh what do you what's your
[02:28:07.400 --> 02:28:11.960]  bottom line take on this incredible bin laden uh hoax
[02:28:11.960 --> 02:28:15.320]  why they're releasing it now as i predicted last night
[02:28:15.320 --> 02:28:20.440]  hyping incredible terror is coming out of this uh this is incredible
[02:28:20.440 --> 02:28:25.000]  well alex i don't understand why everybody's celebrating when our great
[02:28:25.000 --> 02:28:28.680]  ally is dead i mean we're supporting al qaeda in
[02:28:28.680 --> 02:28:33.080]  libya uh we're supporting them overthrow the government in iran
[02:28:33.080 --> 02:28:36.680]  we supported bin laden in syria and kosovo
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:39.880]  in the 90s we supported bin laden in the 80s
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:44.040]  he's been very helpful to the u.s military industrial complex
[02:28:44.040 --> 02:28:48.440]  uh in the wanton slaughter of innocent people in broken back third world
[02:28:48.440 --> 02:28:51.560]  countries and uh those people that are now
[02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:55.800]  celebrating his death uh attending to forget that great
[02:28:55.800 --> 02:28:59.640]  contribution that oba that osama bin laden made
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:03.240]  as an ally to the u.s military industrial complex so
[02:29:03.240 --> 02:29:06.920]  i'm baffled as to why people are happy that he's dead when he's been
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:10.600]  of such great use over the past three decades
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:15.000]  and remember bandar bush a few months over 9 11 on wary king live the u.s
[02:29:15.000 --> 02:29:18.680]  ambassador from saudi arabia their ambassador here
[02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:21.480]  king talked about about bin laden and he said don't talk about him he's a great
[02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:24.760]  hero that's because there was the dual
[02:29:24.760 --> 02:29:27.160]  propaganda over there they were saying he was good
[02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:30.680]  but it wasn't polite to point out that saudi arabia was saying how great he was
[02:29:30.680 --> 02:29:34.840]  and that he's admittedly cia the good news is this is all gone
[02:29:34.840 --> 02:29:39.160]  mega viral uh we didn't just go to bed last night at midnight when all this
[02:29:39.160 --> 02:29:41.160]  was happening we stayed up much of the night
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:44.520]  and got the intel out great job to you curtain imo
[02:29:44.520 --> 02:29:48.520]  jaren nighardt myself absolutely knocked it out of the park my wife was

[02:33:26.280 --> 02:33:33.320]  nobody notices the foul little gaseous dropping uh
[02:33:33.320 --> 02:33:37.480]  that yeah the CIA made fake bin Laden videos for the american people
[02:33:37.480 --> 02:33:40.600]  it didn't matter all those university heads and experts and linguists had
[02:33:40.600 --> 02:33:43.720]  looked at the videos studying the voice they were all fake or they were old
[02:33:43.720 --> 02:33:46.120]  videos re-edited i could just look and go that's the
[02:33:46.120 --> 02:33:51.320]  same video the same jacket he never ages well now they just admit it's all fake
[02:33:51.320 --> 02:33:54.520]  fake photo yesterday issued in all the newspapers tv
[02:33:54.520 --> 02:33:57.400]  then later uh yeah it is fake when folks pointed it out
[02:33:57.400 --> 02:34:00.520]  but doesn't matter it feels good to see it and people
[02:34:00.520 --> 02:34:04.920]  the general public will always think that was real in fact there are still
[02:34:04.920 --> 02:34:08.200]  news outlets out there reporting that's the photo
[02:34:08.200 --> 02:34:11.880]  uh you can't see the body it's been thrown in the ocean
[02:34:11.880 --> 02:34:15.400]  uh if you go back to habeas corpus it wasn't just if you're gonna arrest you
[02:34:15.400 --> 02:34:18.200]  for murder they need to find the body to say you
[02:34:18.200 --> 02:34:21.320]  committed murder show us the corpse habeas corpus
[02:34:21.320 --> 02:34:25.480]  that also was for the king if he said letter of mark go out and find this
[02:34:25.480 --> 02:34:32.280]  highwayman this thief dead or alive 30 pounds dead or alive and you had to
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:37.480]  bring in the dead body in fact uh if somebody had run
[02:34:37.480 --> 02:34:40.840]  to europe a thousand miles away they generally wouldn't pay for it unless
[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:43.720]  you had the body shipped even if it was rotten
[02:34:43.720 --> 02:34:46.840]  so what they would a lot of times would do with chop the head off and put it in
[02:34:46.840 --> 02:34:50.360]  a bag of salt and then just rush back because you could get
[02:34:50.360 --> 02:34:57.400]  huge bounties uh for for getting uh you know traders or or criminals
[02:34:57.400 --> 02:35:01.400]  habeas corpus show us the corpse produce the corpse
[02:35:01.400 --> 02:35:06.120]  bring forward the corpse but we don't get to have the corpse do we
[02:35:06.120 --> 02:35:10.760]  no we don't it's so convenient he now joins the mythical elvis
[02:35:10.760 --> 02:35:15.160]  uh and uh all the other uh famed people that have been kidnapped by flying
[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:19.320]  saucers uh but don't worry the al-qaeda is going to hit us and hit us hard and
[02:35:19.320 --> 02:35:23.240]  there's nukes buried in america and watching obama's
[02:35:23.240 --> 02:35:28.120]  body language we have panetta leaving the cia to go to defense
[02:35:28.120 --> 02:35:35.080]  we have patreus uh the two peas the pp uh leaving and going so patreus is
[02:35:35.080 --> 02:35:40.600]  leaving defense as the general and going over to cia and panetta is
[02:35:40.600 --> 02:35:44.840]  going from cia over to defense the the the reshuffling so they can
[02:35:44.840 --> 02:35:47.960]  fix intelligence better and it's positioning patreus
[02:35:47.960 --> 02:35:51.400]  as the big hero the guy that got bin laden man he can get it done
[02:35:51.400 --> 02:35:57.240]  when he had been feigning uh at the uh and he's big cfr lauriet and big
[02:35:57.240 --> 02:36:00.280]  globalist pro one world government anti gun
[02:36:00.280 --> 02:36:04.520]  republicans will vote for him in a minute you got bin laden here's my gun
[02:36:04.520 --> 02:36:08.120]  by dollars devalued gas is going to be seven bucks a gallon but
[02:36:08.120 --> 02:36:13.320]  patreus got tough that's all that matters in america
[02:36:13.320 --> 02:36:17.800]  what's and how big is it that walter cronkite
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:21.240]  uh hind's carry
[02:36:21.800 --> 02:36:24.600]  madeline albright went on tv and said they've got the body frozen this is
[02:36:24.600 --> 02:36:29.640]  right before the election after we first in 2002 from white house sources
[02:36:29.640 --> 02:36:33.480]  two of them secret one of them public uh steve
[02:36:33.480 --> 02:36:39.160]  a pechenic former uh deputy under uh kissinger who knew bin laden coming out
[02:36:39.160 --> 02:36:42.680]  and saying it was all fake he was frozen that they would roll it out i mean
[02:36:42.680 --> 02:36:46.040]  this is a big public secret in washington
[02:36:46.040 --> 02:36:49.240]  and now they've done this it shows how desperate they are
[02:36:49.240 --> 02:36:52.200]  what's and you've got the floor because i want to get to some calls coming up
[02:36:52.200 --> 02:36:55.560]  too full spectrum what are the key points here
[02:36:55.560 --> 02:36:58.840]  well in relation to what you was just talking about
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:03.480]  uh we reported that they had him on ice it it started to come out you had top
[02:37:03.480 --> 02:37:08.280]  intelligence professionals respected ones saying that that was the case
[02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:13.560]  and then democrats just before the 2004 election start making a big stink about
[02:37:13.560 --> 02:37:18.040]  it so literally three days before the election
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:22.040]  they wheeled out the next best thing which was this
[02:37:22.040 --> 02:37:27.800]  videotape of bin laden basically dissing bush of course it it gave bush the
[02:37:27.800 --> 02:37:32.200]  three or four percentage points he needed to overturn carry and win the
[02:37:32.200 --> 02:37:35.640]  election and it was this bin laden with a dyed
[02:37:35.640 --> 02:37:40.600]  beard as if that would ever happen and so they chose the next best thing
[02:37:40.600 --> 02:37:44.440]  um so they had the opportunity to do it then and they probably
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:48.280]  pulled back from it because there were so many democrats making such a big
[02:37:48.280 --> 02:37:52.600]  stink about it so that's why he's been on ice for that long
[02:37:52.600 --> 02:37:56.600]  in relation to the phony image that we were talking about earlier
[02:37:56.600 --> 02:38:01.240]  um it was confirmed as a hoax i wrote an article immediately saying this is a
[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:03.720]  hoax why is it on the top of the daily mail
[02:38:03.720 --> 02:38:07.400]  website why is it on the top of the london telegraph website
[02:38:07.400 --> 02:38:12.040]  why is it being played across the middle east uh and indeed the guardian on
[02:38:12.040 --> 02:38:16.040]  their own live blog last night in the early hours of the morning
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:19.800]  was speculating speculating whether it was real or fake
[02:38:19.800 --> 02:38:23.640]  and then today they have the nerve to come out and blame quote
[02:38:23.640 --> 02:38:27.560]  conspiracy theorists for circulating this image
[02:38:27.560 --> 02:38:31.240]  as a genuine picture of the dead bin laden
[02:38:31.240 --> 02:38:35.080]  and by the term conspiracy theorists they basically mean us
[02:38:35.080 --> 02:38:38.520]  when we were there right at the very start saying it was a hoax when all the
[02:38:38.520 --> 02:38:42.120]  mainstream media were saying this is a picture of dead bin laden but it shows
[02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:45.160]  their it shows their hatred of their listeners and viewers and
[02:38:45.160 --> 02:38:47.960]  readers how they treat them with total contempt
[02:38:47.960 --> 02:38:53.400]  and and now they're saying that that it was kill not capture no prisoners taken
[02:38:53.400 --> 02:38:57.960]  because whatever poor guy they had in there it turns out that the white house
[02:38:57.960 --> 02:39:02.120]  was doing drills jerry brockheimer we know with the saving
[02:39:02.120 --> 02:39:06.680]  the private uh in iraq that that that they ran drills of that and that was
[02:39:06.680 --> 02:39:10.120]  scripted and that nobody was resisting and that the
[02:39:10.120 --> 02:39:13.400]  area had been safe for two days and they knew that it was safe so they did
[02:39:13.400 --> 02:39:16.520]  like a scripting event this could have been some poor guy
[02:39:16.520 --> 02:39:20.280]  thinking he was part of some script then they send the forces into killing
[02:39:20.280 --> 02:39:22.760]  believing they killed bin laden i mean that's how
[02:39:22.760 --> 02:39:26.200]  globalists do that a lot oh you're part of a drill get on these airplanes
[02:39:26.200 --> 02:39:29.880]  nerve gases released they're remote controlled you're part of a drill go
[02:39:29.880 --> 02:39:34.040]  go on board these buses or trains now they've been caught doing that or
[02:39:34.040 --> 02:39:38.280]  mi6 dressed up like al-qaeda guys with big beards
[02:39:38.280 --> 02:39:42.520]  running around shooting police and stuff in basura they got caught
[02:39:42.520 --> 02:39:45.400]  folks don't forget all of this i mean they do this over and over again it's
[02:39:45.400 --> 02:39:49.000]  like if you have a neighbor that always lies always cheats always steals
[02:39:49.000 --> 02:39:52.360]  you don't give them the keys to your safety deposit box and your car and your
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:57.000]  house here's more u.s. carried out operation
[02:39:57.000 --> 02:40:00.440]  at my discretion obama's a tough big great
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:04.600]  man isn't he boy we gotta love him official bin laden given religious funeral
[02:40:04.600 --> 02:40:09.720]  before sea burial give me a break mission was to kill not capture no
[02:40:09.720 --> 02:40:12.200]  prisoners taken that's the way the russians do it
[02:40:12.200 --> 02:40:15.960]  when they stage an event they just go in and kill a bunch of people and say they
[02:40:15.960 --> 02:40:19.880]  were in there the white house is now debating releasing a photo
[02:40:19.880 --> 02:40:22.520]  i thought they already had the photo of the corpse
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:25.320]  i mean i know why would they have to release the photo of the corpse
[02:40:25.320 --> 02:40:29.960]  because people for a few hours were kind of at a boy boy it feels good we got
[02:40:29.960 --> 02:40:32.280]  them but a lot of people go wait a minute
[02:40:32.280 --> 02:40:35.560]  something's going on here uh paul i think this is going to blow up in their
[02:40:35.560 --> 02:40:40.120]  face unless they hurry up and stage their terror attack
[02:40:40.120 --> 02:40:44.200]  well that's the whole point about it basically they've wheeled out the words
[02:40:44.200 --> 02:40:49.320]  of collegiate mohammed who because he's being tortured until kingdom come for
[02:40:49.320 --> 02:40:52.920]  the past five years uh and basically admits to being

[02:41:04.600 --> 02:41:08.120]  existed he's the one that led them to the location of
[02:41:08.120 --> 02:41:11.480]  bin laden and now he's the one from these
[02:41:11.480 --> 02:41:16.360]  wiki leaks documents again wiki leaks backing up the u.s military industrial
[02:41:16.360 --> 02:41:21.240]  complex as they routinely do just a few days ago coming out and saying that
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:25.480]  there's going to be this nuclear holocaust if bin laden is captured
[02:41:25.480 --> 02:41:29.880]  and it's all about terra fiamongering now you've got the increased bag patrols in
[02:41:29.880 --> 02:41:33.880]  the metro the subway station oh yeah the war on terror is not ending people are

[02:42:50.600 --> 02:42:55.640]  well you mentioned the abc news story and i mean they call us conspiracy theorists
[02:42:55.640 --> 02:42:59.480]  this thing about the u.s chemical biological experts being
[02:42:59.480 --> 02:43:02.680]  withdrawn from japan as if it's some kind of
[02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:07.160]  response to the deadly nuclear al qaeda holocaust that's coming
[02:43:07.160 --> 02:43:12.280]  those people were withdrawn days ago at the request of the japanese government
[02:43:12.280 --> 02:43:15.240]  because the japanese government said they didn't need them
[02:43:15.240 --> 02:43:22.120]  all of us yeah abc news has baselessly connected it to the bin laden story
[02:43:22.120 --> 02:43:25.640]  to craft this hoax to strike the fear of god into people
[02:43:25.640 --> 02:43:30.200]  um that they expect you know nuclear chemo chemical biological attacks
[02:43:30.200 --> 02:43:35.000]  there's no connection whatsoever and they're also trot trotting out anwar
[02:43:35.000 --> 02:43:39.720]  al larky the cia lackey as the new bin laden
[02:43:39.720 --> 02:43:45.000]  family and no reality is connected to this he's admitted cia admittedly trained
[02:43:45.000 --> 02:43:48.360]  runs all the major patsy attacks and it's like
[02:43:48.360 --> 02:43:52.120]  among major talk shows and a month ago they were ready to talk about it a week
[02:43:52.120 --> 02:43:55.560]  ago now they're like yeah i know he's at the pentagon but still al qaeda is real
[02:43:55.560 --> 02:44:01.240]  this is so great we killed bin laden i'm like reality reality wake up
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:05.240]  i think they've come to the point where they've been lied to so much that
[02:44:05.240 --> 02:44:10.680]  it kind of uh they like it yeah i mean they want to believe the lie because
[02:44:10.680 --> 02:44:15.240]  they've just been so you know bathed in this well no i mean there are some
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:18.440]  women that like men that knock their teeth out and break their nose
[02:44:18.440 --> 02:44:22.120]  that there's a big movement in the us and worldwide where men and women are
[02:44:22.120 --> 02:44:25.960]  chopping their arms and legs off and and they have their arms and legs chopped
[02:44:25.960 --> 02:44:28.440]  off more and more because they've always got to get trendier than the other and
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:31.800]  then they live in a box in a diaper folks i'm not joking documentaries been
[02:44:31.800 --> 02:44:34.120]  made about this and then you and then the other person
[02:44:34.120 --> 02:44:37.640]  tins for you and you have no arms and legs you got to go to mexico to have it
[02:44:37.640 --> 02:44:43.240]  done uh and and and then your lover in quotes keeps you in the box
[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:47.160]  and and and so yeah i mean in a way that's what this people kind of like it
[02:44:47.160 --> 02:44:50.680]  you know they kind of like being kind it's kind of fun isn't it
[02:44:50.680 --> 02:44:54.760]  it's Stockholm syndrome they like their captain they like the person doing the
[02:44:54.760 --> 02:44:59.240]  brainwashing um and it's funny that we had this big fake
[02:44:59.240 --> 02:45:03.960]  patriotic fervor in the uk a few days ago with you know
[02:45:03.960 --> 02:45:07.480]  union jacks everywhere outside people's houses of course
[02:45:07.480 --> 02:45:10.920]  they didn't put them up at any other time because they get called racist
[02:45:10.920 --> 02:45:15.800]  and then you've got this massive fake patriotic fervor today with these
[02:45:15.800 --> 02:45:19.800]  uh george washington university college kids that just
[02:45:19.800 --> 02:45:22.920]  miraculously turned up on the white house lawn
[02:45:22.920 --> 02:45:27.080]  minutes after the announcement with crisp american flags
[02:45:27.080 --> 02:45:31.240]  made by slaves in china um totally staged just like
[02:45:31.240 --> 02:45:35.080]  in iraq when they pulled the statue down they said hundreds of thousands did it
[02:45:35.080 --> 02:45:39.000]  and and we finally got camera shots that were why it was like 40 50 people maybe
[02:45:39.000 --> 02:45:43.320]  and it was pachari not pachari he's the un scammer
[02:45:43.320 --> 02:45:49.320]  uh who's the big uh us guy they sent in chelabi sorry go ahead
[02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:52.840]  yeah and so you've got this big fake celebration
[02:45:52.840 --> 02:45:56.840]  when these people in reality are only celebrating another chapter
[02:45:56.840 --> 02:46:00.600]  in the collapse of the united states as a global empire
[02:46:00.600 --> 02:46:05.560]  and a global superpower because uh as hamid gull was warning in the last hour
[02:46:05.560 --> 02:46:09.800]  when you spoke to him this only has the potential to lead to more war
[02:46:09.800 --> 02:46:14.680]  and more bloodshed in the middle east i mean bin laden as i wrote my article
[02:46:14.680 --> 02:46:19.080]  today was a very useful uh boogie man in life but in death
[02:46:19.080 --> 02:46:22.760]  you know the propaganda value will only be intensified because it's
[02:46:22.760 --> 02:46:27.240]  it's p p2o g rearing its head once again it's about
[02:46:27.240 --> 02:46:31.800]  killing terrorist leaders to then provoke more terrorist attacks
[02:46:31.800 --> 02:46:35.560]  which is exactly now what they're telling us will happen
[02:46:35.560 --> 02:46:39.480]  um and we're told that the united states invaded
[02:46:39.480 --> 02:46:43.400]  afghanistan because that was where bin laden was being harbored
[02:46:43.400 --> 02:46:47.320]  uh now that bin laden's finally dead does that mean that
[02:46:47.320 --> 02:46:50.760]  obama will move to pull the troops out of afghanistan
[02:46:50.760 --> 02:46:54.840]  as you said earlier does it mean that we're not going to get tsa sticking hands
[02:46:54.840 --> 02:46:59.720]  down six-year-old pence uh as michael moore asks today on his website does
[02:46:59.720 --> 02:47:04.120]  this mean that we can uh have have shampoo in our carry-on bags
[02:47:04.120 --> 02:47:07.640]  going into the airport no it doesn't mean any of that
[02:47:07.640 --> 02:47:10.920]  it means the wars are going to be intensified because now they're going to
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:15.400]  use any uh terrorist attacks that come as a result of this whether real or
[02:47:15.400 --> 02:47:19.080]  contrived as a further justification to go after
[02:47:19.080 --> 02:47:24.600]  syria and to legitimize the airstrikes the bombings the killing the murders of
[02:47:24.600 --> 02:47:28.280]  little kids in libya as well yes and they're saying
[02:47:28.280 --> 02:47:31.640]  hey look we did this for 10 years but it paid off sit down
[02:47:31.640 --> 02:47:35.240]  shut up and take it hey but the the cia ships the drugs in
[02:47:35.240 --> 02:47:40.600]  shut up hey the foreign banks are abusing a shut up we kill bin laden
[02:47:40.600 --> 02:47:45.400]  we're your protectors oh it's sick go ahead
[02:47:45.400 --> 02:47:48.440]  no i mean exactly and it's it's just about another
[02:47:48.440 --> 02:47:52.600]  big worship of the government just like we had last week in the uk and now
[02:47:52.600 --> 02:47:56.440]  you're having it there and every other issue the fact that the dollars
[02:47:56.440 --> 02:48:00.520]  collapsing uh they're murdering little kids in libya that
[02:48:00.520 --> 02:48:05.240]  china is by 2016 going to be the new global superpower
[02:48:05.240 --> 02:48:08.920]  uh coincidentally because it doesn't spend all its money on bombing broken
[02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:12.760]  back third world countries that's all shoved to one side and
[02:48:12.760 --> 02:48:16.120]  the nation gets to have this big fake pep rally
[02:48:16.120 --> 02:48:22.920]  over um osama bin laden's iced corpse being thawed out 10 years after he's
[02:48:22.920 --> 02:48:27.480]  already died so it's just a big sideshow it's another fake it's another phony
[02:48:27.480 --> 02:48:30.600]  and it was it was based in the very first hours
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:36.680]  on this fake backdrop of this hoax image that all the mainstream media
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:41.240]  outlets reported as genuine and then when it became confirmed that it was a hoax
[02:48:41.240 --> 02:48:44.360]  blame it on the conspiracy theorists and now
[02:48:44.360 --> 02:48:47.800]  there are more articles coming out you mentioned one earlier on
[02:48:47.800 --> 02:48:53.320]  out of the atlantic um lambasting the conspiracy theorists for day and notice
[02:48:53.320 --> 02:48:57.480]  he wouldn't link to our actual articles that have the transcripts
[02:48:57.480 --> 02:49:01.240]  with the former number two person at the state department saying he was frozen
[02:49:01.240 --> 02:49:06.680]  and it was all fake nine years ago no they linked to a quote cheech and chong
[02:49:06.680 --> 02:49:10.360]  forum and you go there and it's not really our evidence it's it's their
[02:49:10.360 --> 02:49:14.520]  stuff to make it look like we're crazy weed heads
[02:49:14.520 --> 02:49:18.600]  well yes just like the london guardian blamed it on conspiracy theorists
[02:49:18.600 --> 02:49:23.400]  and yet they provided no source for what conspiracy theorists said that the
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:27.640]  hoax bin laden dead image was real when they were all saying it was fake
[02:49:27.640 --> 02:49:32.280]  as the mainstream media was saying it was real so again it's la la land it's
[02:49:32.280 --> 02:49:36.840]  black is white up is down um and it's that the propaganda's only going to get
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:42.360]  more intense um in the in the coming days because they need to use this um to
[02:49:42.360 --> 02:49:46.360]  legitimize the wars in the middle east and the attack on libya
[02:49:46.360 --> 02:49:49.560]  i was doing an interview saturday with some folks we brought into town for
[02:49:49.560 --> 02:49:53.560]  upcoming film and i called my wife saturday

[02:54:35.720 --> 02:54:39.960]  we don't know why i mean they could create a whole cloth fake one better than
[02:54:39.960 --> 02:54:43.800]  this because it's it's it's designed to get us fighting
[02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:47.000]  with each other and then they move on to the next thing it's a military tactic

[02:54:59.480 --> 02:55:02.520]  doesn't matter if it's ridiculous it doesn't matter
[02:55:02.520 --> 02:55:06.200]  if it's crazy it doesn't matter how obvious it is
[02:55:06.200 --> 02:55:11.080]  and the globalist have a philosophy of believing there's too many people
[02:55:11.080 --> 02:55:14.120]  in most mainline yep these are taught this in college and
[02:55:14.120 --> 02:55:16.600]  if you ask them whether too many people should we get rid of them they say yeah
[02:55:16.600 --> 02:55:18.440]  and you go well that's nazi and they go
[02:55:18.440 --> 02:55:22.760]  well okay but they feel like they're part of the system so it's not going to
[02:55:22.760 --> 02:55:26.120]  happen to them see they're delusional
[02:55:26.600 --> 02:55:30.520]  but please go to info wars dot com and prison planet dot com go into the

[02:55:36.440 --> 02:55:40.200]  today we're posting and writing so many articles with so many facets
[02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:43.000]  it's moving
[02:55:43.960 --> 02:55:47.080]  every hour you know the main news is going off the front page
[02:55:47.080 --> 02:55:51.000]  and and there's so much intel there get it out to everyone
[02:55:51.000 --> 02:55:56.200]  because they are clearly testing the public
[02:55:56.200 --> 02:55:58.600]  and this is the most important thing i've said today and i meant to say up to
[02:55:58.600 --> 02:56:01.000]  the whole last three hours and just got so busy
[02:56:01.000 --> 02:56:04.040]  with other my new shot and get to it this is the number one thing i want to
[02:56:04.040 --> 02:56:07.240]  say right now please listen to me
[02:56:07.240 --> 02:56:10.440]  it was as if glenn beck was speaking last night
[02:56:10.440 --> 02:56:13.400]  when when obama spoke it was as if george w bush
[02:56:13.400 --> 02:56:17.240]  it was pure propaganda the 912 type deal
[02:56:17.240 --> 02:56:21.160]  let's remember the unity and the anger and the mindlessness and the giving up
[02:56:21.160 --> 02:56:25.720]  the thought process and saying i want to give my rights up
[02:56:25.720 --> 02:56:29.480]  let's remember the how we felt the day after 9 11
[02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:33.160]  well that's what bush says that's what glenn beck says that's what obama says
[02:56:33.160 --> 02:56:36.600]  yeah get into that war fever get into that war mode
[02:56:36.600 --> 02:56:39.480]  because they're getting us geared up for more wars they've launched these attacks
[02:56:39.480 --> 02:56:42.920]  in libya they're blowing up orphanages they're killing people's families
[02:56:42.920 --> 02:56:46.440]  they're running al-qaeda in there and they need
[02:56:46.440 --> 02:56:50.120]  to have obama be able to look like he's anti al-qaeda right now
[02:56:50.120 --> 02:56:54.920]  because the myth of al-qaeda was broken as it was in the la times new york times
[02:56:54.920 --> 02:56:59.160]  that yeah al-qaeda is good and bad and the and the group we're
[02:56:59.160 --> 02:57:03.720]  working with they're good and that's what henry kissinger went crazy
[02:57:03.720 --> 02:57:06.440]  at that trilateral commission meeting remember two weeks ago we covered this
[02:57:06.440 --> 02:57:10.600]  or a week and a half ago i mean they are upset their whole
[02:57:10.600 --> 02:57:14.360]  fake system is falling in the pakistanis are saying get out of here
[02:57:14.360 --> 02:57:17.800]  stop the drone attacks we're done oh we caught bin laden
[02:57:17.800 --> 02:57:21.720]  oh al-qaeda is gonna hit us everywhere now a guy we've been torturing for eight
[02:57:21.720 --> 02:57:25.400]  years says so i mean do you really believe 160 nukes
[02:57:25.400 --> 02:57:29.240]  are buried do you believe any of this
[02:57:30.440 --> 02:57:38.280]  the u.s and british media they put out fake bin laden photos say it's real
[02:57:38.280 --> 02:57:41.800]  we come out in the middle of the night with an article saying it's not
[02:57:41.800 --> 02:57:45.400]  and they come out and say you guys put out the fake photo
[02:57:45.400 --> 02:57:51.240]  we're like no you clearly did they just want to confuse everybody
[02:57:51.240 --> 02:57:57.720]  until people just finally go i don't know what the truth is anymore
[02:57:57.720 --> 02:58:01.560]  i know the globalists lie even when it suits them because they don't ever want
[02:58:01.560 --> 02:58:05.320]  to tell the truth because if they ever tell the truth that might start
[02:58:05.320 --> 02:58:09.000]  creating that instinct in them it's so easy to tell the truth it's so easy to
[02:58:09.000 --> 02:58:12.280]  go with the info you really have and with your gut and with the research
[02:58:12.280 --> 02:58:15.400]  instead of having to lie and then think about what you said before
[02:58:15.400 --> 02:58:18.760]  my job is so easy to just sit here and tell the truth
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:22.120]  and we've been right on every front and it's more important than ever because

[03:00:06.600 --> 03:00:09.960]  little kids i guess they're adults running around waving their american
[03:00:09.960 --> 03:00:12.760]  flags part of a staged event within minutes of the announcement that their
[03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:16.040]  king their emperor uh would be announcing that he had
[03:00:16.040 --> 03:00:21.720]  defeated the evil demon uh usama bin uh laden

[03:00:41.880 --> 03:00:46.120]  then they kill the patsy terrorist in fantasy land
[03:00:46.120 --> 03:00:49.480]  and reality and fantasy are just blurring now
[03:00:49.480 --> 03:00:52.200]  and a lot of people can't tell the difference matt in arizona you're on the
[03:00:52.200 --> 03:00:54.040]  ear
[03:00:54.040 --> 03:00:59.400]  going on roll my just want to i just want to discuss one thing
[03:00:59.400 --> 03:01:03.640]  the style that i've seen through my military career i've been in the military
[03:01:03.640 --> 03:01:08.440]  for 10 years and i've seen it uh evolved
[03:01:08.440 --> 03:01:11.800]  when i first went to military my first awakening to it
[03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:15.720]  we were told by our command that we were to tell our families
[03:01:15.720 --> 03:01:19.720]  that the war on terror was progressing well
[03:01:19.720 --> 03:01:23.240]  and we were taking out all these you know essentially
[03:01:23.240 --> 03:01:28.440]  enemy leaders which is completely untrue and i didn't understand i was naive at
[03:01:28.440 --> 03:01:30.440]  the time every time they capture them they let
[03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:34.360]  them go sorry go ahead you're right i saw it first hand
[03:01:34.360 --> 03:01:37.800]  uh i didn't understand it i'm part of me didn't believe it
[03:01:37.800 --> 03:01:42.920]  so i went along with it and gradually as my military career went on and i came
[03:01:42.920 --> 03:01:47.640]  back home and i saw the hatred just the absolute
[03:01:47.640 --> 03:01:51.640]  hatred and passion that my friends and family had
[03:01:51.640 --> 03:01:57.400]  toward these ghosts these people that basically don't exist
[03:01:57.400 --> 03:02:00.760]  that harm us you know and the people who are harming us
[03:02:00.760 --> 03:02:05.880]  were letting them do it and it's absolutely letting them do it
[03:02:05.880 --> 03:02:09.320]  so it just i had a hard time fathoming it
[03:02:09.320 --> 03:02:13.640]  and as times progressed and i live in Tucson and i watched
[03:02:13.640 --> 03:02:18.360]  the whole thing with Jared Loftner and i watched the hatred just build and build
[03:02:18.360 --> 03:02:21.640]  and then last night my wife calls me into the other room tells me
[03:02:21.640 --> 03:02:28.840]  bin Laden's dead i look at her i said oh yeah that speaks and she i love my
[03:02:28.840 --> 03:02:33.160]  wife and she's an extremely intelligent woman but she buys it
[03:02:33.160 --> 03:02:37.240]  well people get caught up in the event humans that are even highly intelligent
[03:02:37.240 --> 03:02:41.000]  get into a mob psychology because 10 000 years ago
[03:02:41.000 --> 03:02:44.920]  if a group of saber-toothed cats came over or another tribe about to kill you
[03:02:44.920 --> 03:02:49.080]  and take your land and your kids you got together in mob psychology
[03:02:49.080 --> 03:02:52.280]  thinking's over it's clobbering time as the thing says
[03:02:52.280 --> 03:02:56.760]  so we're designed i just got chills it's we're designed to turn off the
[03:02:56.760 --> 03:03:00.200]  thinking so your wife was turning it off the scary
[03:03:00.200 --> 03:03:02.760]  devil had been defeated by our warriors and she was
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:06.600]  a booga hookah hookah I mean it was time to
[03:03:06.600 --> 03:03:09.960]  I mean that's what that is like you know like dogs
[03:03:09.960 --> 03:03:13.560]  that's why you don't run from a dog because it goes into instinct to chase you
[03:03:13.560 --> 03:03:16.920]  and so it's it's just like pray running you know your wife's like we have
[03:03:16.920 --> 03:03:21.080]  defeated the you know him Fred Flintstone and you're like okay Betty
[03:03:21.080 --> 03:03:25.240]  but see you are in an advanced level of of of being a staying conscious
[03:03:25.240 --> 03:03:28.200]  and you've seen the propaganda and then you see her
[03:03:28.200 --> 03:03:31.800]  and all the good old boys calling and going I'm walking to all today
[03:03:31.800 --> 03:03:35.720]  America's back no America's been seized by foreign evil banks
[03:03:35.720 --> 03:03:38.840]  and until you get scientific about this we have no future
[03:03:38.840 --> 03:03:42.360]  and your wife will wake up later but it's like when my
[03:03:42.360 --> 03:03:45.640]  girlfriend at the time now my wife lit candles on 9 11 for the dead
[03:03:45.640 --> 03:03:47.880]  I said honey we care about the dead that's what we're going to get their
[03:03:47.880 --> 03:03:51.720]  real murderers don't be part of that public display that will give power to
[03:03:51.720 --> 03:03:54.440]  the globalists to launch these wars and take our liberties
[03:03:54.440 --> 03:03:57.800]  and she got really mad at me but about a year later she apologized she said
[03:03:57.800 --> 03:04:01.400]  now I see and I said that's right you say a prayer for those dead people in
[03:04:01.400 --> 03:04:03.800]  your heart and and you fight for their real
[03:04:03.800 --> 03:04:06.760]  memory that the real criminals that murdered them they brought to justice
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:10.440]  don't put red white and blue candles out on the out on the front
[03:04:10.440 --> 03:04:15.480]  buying into the mass fake psychology it's like this when the Nazis
[03:04:15.480 --> 03:04:17.560]  said that the polls attacked them it wasn't true
[03:04:17.560 --> 03:04:20.840]  Germans put their Nazi flags out you know oh the polls got us we're going to get
[03:04:20.840 --> 03:04:23.640]  them well later we learned the polls didn't attack Germany
[03:04:23.640 --> 03:04:26.440]  you see and and so you don't want to be a chump
[03:04:26.440 --> 03:04:29.800]  great point so you've seen this progress we're out of time

[03:04:59.800 --> 03:05:15.720]  make the conscious decision to know the truth and then use your energy
