[00:58.140 --> 01:05.040]  24th day of August 2010 transmission okay I always attempt to do this and I'm
[01:05.040 --> 01:09.800]  never successful because I'll start covering one article meaning just to
[01:09.800 --> 01:13.640]  go over the headlines then I'll get bogged down on one story let me just
[01:13.640 --> 01:22.080]  attempt to go over the stacks of news that I have here in front of me here is
[01:22.080 --> 01:28.320]  the police state biometric grid stack fingerprint check-in tried at 24-hour
[01:28.320 --> 01:37.840]  fitness you must thumbprint new canna considers tracking devices for students
[01:37.840 --> 01:42.720]  RFID other schools are already doing it biometric iris scanning technology
[01:42.720 --> 01:50.080]  rolled out across entire city and they say it'll be worldwide the next 10 years
[01:50.080 --> 01:54.240]  you'll have to rent and scan to buy and sell germany to roll out ID cards with
[01:54.240 --> 02:03.360]  embedded RFID that's just some of the news we have on that front also apple
[02:03.360 --> 02:09.640]  patent targets iPhone thieves but jailbreakers to what's a jailbreaker
[02:09.640 --> 02:17.200]  anyone that puts a program on the iPhone that's not authorized or in the case of my
[02:17.200 --> 02:26.840]  wife her iPhone won't jack into a certain type of broadband internet so she's
[02:26.840 --> 02:34.280]  learned how to hook her iPhone into her iPad so the iPad can do that and PC
[02:34.280 --> 02:39.480]  world's reporting that Apple will just remotely break into your phone that
[02:39.480 --> 02:42.880]  means they're surveilling what's on your phone they admit they are and that if
[02:42.880 --> 02:48.480]  they see you download a program that's not authorized or if you jailbreak the
[02:48.480 --> 02:54.720]  iPhone or iPad but in the case of cell phone service the the iPhone to where
[02:54.720 --> 03:01.400]  you can get another cell phone service other than AT&T you buy the phone you
[03:01.400 --> 03:08.400]  go out you break the software on it that doesn't let you get another phone
[03:08.400 --> 03:14.280]  service you go out and get another phone service Verizon or something else they
[03:14.280 --> 03:19.440]  can come in and kill your phone or take it over or wipe your phone so just more
[03:19.440 --> 03:26.640]  evidence of control on that front also there's incredible new hype that I've
[03:26.640 --> 03:30.120]  become aware of and Matt Ryan was trying to tell me about this a few weeks ago
[03:30.120 --> 03:35.560]  they actually posted a blurb about it on info wars.com then I happened to see a
[03:35.560 --> 03:39.640]  newscast covering it this morning and they're like your computer is delivering
[03:39.640 --> 03:44.960]  hardcore drugs we need to have the police raid your home if your children are
[03:44.960 --> 03:49.880]  listening to this type of music or flashing lights on your computer and
[03:49.880 --> 03:55.960]  then it cuts to one of the old things I've seen for 15 years where when you
[03:55.960 --> 04:00.760]  play audio on the web it shows the swirling random patterns and they said
[04:00.760 --> 04:06.080]  that's a hardcore drug and they want to pass laws to ban it and here's USA Today
[04:06.080 --> 04:14.560]  web delivers new worry for parents digital drugs and I did some research on
[04:14.560 --> 04:21.320]  it it's total quackery in fact here's a big Australian newspaper the eye drugs
[04:21.320 --> 04:29.000]  don't work internet drugs inexpensive digital drugs may sound a new alarm and
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.480]  technically there's some truth to this it says they listen to this music and it
[04:34.480 --> 04:40.160]  uplift them it excites them well what does Beethoven's ninth symphony do if
[04:40.160 --> 04:46.280]  that floats your boat certainly does mine or what is some AC DC do with its
[04:46.280 --> 04:52.320]  high energy they're now saying it's a drug and the government's coming so we'll
[04:52.320 --> 04:56.640]  cover that a bunch of economic news I'll break it all down the other side it's
[04:56.640 --> 05:01.360]  a city the news is getting crazier and crazier Alex Jones here with urgent

[08:32.640 --> 08:41.040]  transmitting illegal drugs right now it's techno music from the 1990s with
[08:41.040 --> 08:50.560]  some pulsing snowflake images and this is reportedly hard core drugs and the
[08:50.560 --> 08:57.320]  government wants to pass laws to ban what you're listening to right now here
[08:57.320 --> 09:04.560]  is the news articles here's USA today give me a document shot man it says web
[09:04.560 --> 09:13.160]  delivers new worry for parents digital drugs USA today here's another one
[09:13.160 --> 09:19.000]  Richmond Times dispatch inexpensive digital drugs may sound a new alarm and
[09:19.000 --> 09:25.080]  then an Australian news report out of their technology section of stuff dot
[09:25.080 --> 09:30.080]  co.nz actually New Zealand we got a bunch of mainstream articles telling the
[09:30.080 --> 09:35.120]  truth saying the eye drugs don't work internet drugs but we've got all these
[09:35.120 --> 09:41.200]  newscasts about how incredibly dangerous it is here's one eye dosing can you get
[09:41.200 --> 09:46.840]  high off of digital drugs this is a total media government hoax we've got all
[09:46.840 --> 09:50.360]  these newscasts with cops saying we've got to do something about this it could
[09:50.360 --> 09:55.720]  lead to harder drugs we've got to check your computers well what do you think
[09:55.720 --> 10:02.840]  Wagner or Beethoven or the great classical composers do I mean when I
[10:02.840 --> 10:06.640]  was a child my parents took me to many symphonies for the Dallas Symphony and I
[10:06.640 --> 10:13.000]  remember being just rising up out of my chair you know the energy of it and and
[10:13.000 --> 10:20.760]  the magic of it the majesty of being at the Grand Canyon on Christmas day when
[10:20.760 --> 10:25.680]  we're camping as a child and walking out and seeing the little birds jumping
[10:25.680 --> 10:32.080]  around the snow and the cold wind and the sun rising crisp and delicious it's a
[10:32.080 --> 10:38.160]  drug a natural drug we know beauty we know what's good when you go watch your
[10:38.160 --> 10:43.200]  football team win or your soccer team it it stimulates natural endorphins
[10:43.200 --> 10:48.720]  because at a tribal level you feel like your tribe has won and what is the
[10:48.720 --> 10:52.440]  government saying they want to give everyone forced vaccines they have over
[10:52.440 --> 10:57.600]  100 of these that are now being tested and approved to quote stop anxiety stop
[10:57.600 --> 11:02.360]  emotion stop stress they want to put lithium in the water so you don't have
[11:02.360 --> 11:07.120]  anxiety anxiety is part of life are you eating a healthy diet you drinking too
[11:07.120 --> 11:10.480]  much coffee you know they don't tell people don't give your kids soft drinks
[11:10.480 --> 11:14.840]  full of caffeine of their hyper don't give them all these different dyes that
[11:14.840 --> 11:19.000]  admittedly are like amphetamines no no no their answer is if your kids hyper
[11:19.000 --> 11:26.200]  put them on speed at a roll or riddling to burn out their brain over time it
[11:26.200 --> 11:29.640]  will burn them out and they will be relaxed oh you're a little depressed
[11:29.640 --> 11:34.400]  let's give you fluorine based Prozac that admittedly massively increases
[11:34.400 --> 11:40.200]  mental illness and suicide so let's play this music again this is one of the
[11:40.200 --> 11:45.000]  most popular videos concerning you know these eye drugs and there's hundreds
[11:45.000 --> 11:48.880]  and hundreds of these on YouTube and it's techno I mean I can't tell you in
[11:48.880 --> 11:52.680]  college how many clubs I went to and yeah you're jumping around you're having a
[11:52.680 --> 11:58.120]  good time and there's some truth to the flashing lights that the government
[11:58.120 --> 12:05.400]  admits that you go into a type of lower brain pattern very suggestible
[12:05.400 --> 12:12.840]  subconsciously associated with sleep or daydreaming so they can program you when
[12:12.840 --> 12:17.440]  you're watching the flicker rate of television sets so in a way there's
[12:17.440 --> 12:21.280]  some truth to this music is highly suggestible that's why the Pentagon
[12:21.280 --> 12:25.640]  promotes hardcore heavy metal music and other things for the tank drivers and
[12:25.640 --> 12:30.200]  frontline combat troops they've had PBS specials about that because it gets them
[12:30.200 --> 12:34.360]  fired up that's why football teams in the locker room before the game and
[12:34.360 --> 12:41.480]  during halftime will play you know high energy music it's why they play you know
[12:41.480 --> 12:47.920]  exciting music during the breaks at sporting events to keep people all
[12:47.920 --> 12:54.160]  amped up but the government is now saying this is a drug anything that can
[12:54.160 --> 12:59.480]  hype you up and some people it's George straight some people it's classical some
[12:59.480 --> 13:04.520]  people it's rock and roll people like myself I mean if it's good music I like
[13:04.520 --> 13:11.720]  it all but I particularly like classical and so there's a small kernel of truth
[13:11.720 --> 13:18.880]  but it's not a drug it's inducing your body to produce endorphins because your
[13:18.880 --> 13:25.120]  soul your intellect the hard wiring of your electrochemical computer the oil
[13:25.120 --> 13:30.680]  based computer that's what your brain is it's over 70% water but of the 25% or
[13:30.680 --> 13:34.800]  so that's solid most of it is cholesterol that's why they actually
[13:34.800 --> 13:38.800]  tell people that have the seizures and epileptic problems to eat a high fat
[13:38.800 --> 13:42.280]  diet and because it's been shown in many studies for 50 years to stabilize the
[13:42.280 --> 13:46.240]  brain but they won't tell people that now they tell them let's give you some
[13:46.240 --> 13:50.840]  hardcore drugs so you won't have these seizures when a lot of times a high fat
[13:50.840 --> 13:55.160]  diet of the proper types of fat will help you I mean now is eating fat a drug
[13:55.160 --> 14:00.800]  because it increases brain activity it increases connectivity it increases the
[14:00.800 --> 14:09.000]  overall power of your mind fat especially things like fish oil notice
[14:09.000 --> 14:15.440]  they're trying to make everything illegal that is empowering the people and I
[14:15.440 --> 14:20.720]  think that you know techno type music is nothing but empowering it's high
[14:20.720 --> 14:25.280]  energy it's pulsating it I mean a lot of times I'll be up here late at night and
[14:25.280 --> 14:29.040]  we're exhausted trying I'll say hey let's let's turn on some rock and roll
[14:29.040 --> 14:33.600]  turn on some classical let's turn on some techno and you know put on some
[14:33.600 --> 14:37.440]  headphones go walk around on the parking lot you know to get us jazzed back up so
[14:37.440 --> 14:41.960]  we can finish our work and keep our brains focused is that drugs and I on
[14:41.960 --> 14:45.680]  drugs you better believe I'm on drugs when I go in there and drink that coffee
[14:45.680 --> 14:50.800]  that's a hardcore drug but it's because it's a chemical going in caffeine and
[14:50.800 --> 14:54.200]  other things in the oils that are in coffee that also have an effect it's
[14:54.200 --> 14:58.200]  not just the caffeine but is listening to music a drug does the government need
[14:58.200 --> 15:04.400]  to get involved now Cass Sunstein two years ago said that if you criticize and
[15:04.400 --> 15:08.200]  say man-made global warming isn't real anthropogenic global warming that you
[15:08.200 --> 15:13.840]  should be find feed or maybe even arrest it and that blogs should be taxed and
[15:13.840 --> 15:18.600]  now Philadelphia has launched a $300 tax on all free speech on the internet you
[15:18.600 --> 15:23.000]  want to have your own personal blog on blogspot you got to pay them money well
[15:23.000 --> 15:26.320]  here's the Guardian reporting on something that's been known for over a
[15:26.320 --> 15:31.160]  hundred years they've got studies for over 70 years in Scandinavia where for
[15:31.160 --> 15:34.520]  several months out of the year it's totally dark and the suicides go way up
[15:34.520 --> 15:39.400]  and they learned decades and decades and decades ago to have artificial sun
[15:39.400 --> 15:44.040]  lamps in the working areas and in the homes and to paint the walls white
[15:44.040 --> 15:49.280]  because your eyes are an extension of the brain when you're gestating in your
[15:49.280 --> 15:54.440]  mother at a certain point I think it's about a month in on average the eyes
[15:54.440 --> 15:58.960]  grow out of the brain so the eyes are the window to the brain to the soul and
[15:58.960 --> 16:06.040]  they need sunlight they need to to to to see sunlight for dopamine levels and
[16:06.040 --> 16:10.440]  other natural chemicals in the brain so sunlight is a drug and what does Cass
[16:10.440 --> 16:15.280]  Unstein say he says it is a conspiracy theory to say that humans need any
[16:15.280 --> 16:21.320]  sunlight and we should stop people from getting sunlight he's a eugenicist okay
[16:21.320 --> 16:24.800]  he doesn't want you healthy and happy and people say well I don't want to get a
[16:24.800 --> 16:29.840]  bunch of sun because I'll look old folks it's you're meant to get old you are
[16:29.840 --> 16:34.800]  meant to have your skin get old but it but by your skin burning it gives you
[16:34.800 --> 16:39.400]  all of the different hormone releases not just the vitamin D production that
[16:39.400 --> 16:44.560]  your entire body needs and it keeps your organs young it massively decreases
[16:44.560 --> 16:49.360]  cancer in thousands of studies over the last hundred years they had these
[16:49.360 --> 16:54.200]  studies in 1908 1910 1920s but but here's a whole new group of studies
[16:54.200 --> 17:01.760]  MS and arthritis multiple sclerosis and arthritis may be linked to lack of sun
[17:01.760 --> 17:08.480]  scientists say vitamin D found to exert an influence over genes associated with
[17:08.480 --> 17:12.920]  certain diseases more common in northern hemisphere well there's also the studies
[17:12.920 --> 17:19.280]  on cancer you actually get higher rates of cancer when you get no sun the study
[17:19.280 --> 17:24.840]  show then if you get a lot of sun but it's a darn if you do darn if you don't
[17:24.840 --> 17:29.360]  the optimum and they have different statistics depending on your skin type
[17:29.360 --> 17:33.320]  but you can look the different studies they vary but someone who's a northern
[17:33.320 --> 17:40.000]  European needs off and on about an hour of direct sunlight a week someone who
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.680]  has darker skin who's more equatorial may need upwards of 10 hours a week I
[17:44.680 --> 17:48.680]  mean you're supposed to have black skin if you got black skin you're designed
[17:48.680 --> 17:52.960]  for that for your area of the world if you've got brown skin you're designed as
[17:52.960 --> 17:57.440]  you go higher up if you've got white skin scientists have known for decades
[17:57.440 --> 18:01.800]  why people in northern hemisphere have blue eyes it's because they allow more
[18:01.800 --> 18:05.640]  light in people with blue eyes on average or more light sensitive they have
[18:05.640 --> 18:11.000]  better night vision because your eyes are designed to suck in that light to get
[18:11.000 --> 18:14.560]  that light but if you have dark eyes it's because you come from a more
[18:14.560 --> 18:18.760]  equatorial area and it's designed to block it out we're beautifully designed
[18:18.760 --> 18:23.320]  creatures but here's Cass Sunstein saying I don't care there's a thousand
[18:23.320 --> 18:28.280]  studies with top scientists saying this stops cancer it stops depression it
[18:28.280 --> 18:31.360]  stops everything they've got all these double-blind studies where they find
[18:31.360 --> 18:35.720]  st. John's ward is many times better for you to stop depression than Prozac and
[18:35.720 --> 18:39.360]  that Prozac actually makes you depressed but sunlight and exercise is even
[18:39.360 --> 18:43.880]  better if I'm bummed out and tired and feel like crud and have been sick or
[18:43.880 --> 18:48.840]  whatever I just go out even if it's the winter and I even if it's your 40
[18:48.840 --> 18:52.120]  degrees and I'll just get my underwear in the backyard and just lay there for an
[18:52.120 --> 18:56.840]  hour shivering and I just feel completely energized by the Sun just like
[18:56.840 --> 19:02.320]  you're a plant ladies and gentlemen you need it you need it you need the Sun
[19:02.320 --> 19:07.240]  you don't need to be burned if you get too much you'll get skin cancer but if
[19:07.240 --> 19:13.760]  you don't get any your body shuts down your body shuts down so sunlight's
[19:13.760 --> 19:18.840]  a drug music's a drug getting excited's a drug and they want to block all of that
[19:18.840 --> 19:24.600]  it's not a drug it's part of who we are it's part of what we are and it goes on
[19:24.600 --> 19:29.240]  it says insufficient exposure to sunshine resulting in low levels of
[19:29.240 --> 19:32.040]  vitamin D can play a part in a wide range of diseases for multiple
[19:32.040 --> 19:35.680]  sclerosis to rheumatoid arthritis type 1 diabetes some cancers and even
[19:35.680 --> 19:39.600]  dementia scientists say well yeah you I mean they've done studies with
[19:39.600 --> 19:43.000]  prisoners again for close to a hundred years about all the diseases that
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.440]  increase with prisoners not getting sun that's why if you go back to the the
[19:47.440 --> 19:51.600]  whole prison sciences in France more than 200 years ago they found to start
[19:51.600 --> 19:54.880]  getting people out to get some sign point is I've already digressed got a
[19:54.880 --> 19:58.960]  lot of other news coming up but it is not a drug to listen to music or get

[33:29.520 --> 33:34.200]  ago and I didn't really pay attention because it was so silly but but the
[33:34.200 --> 33:38.000]  point they were making was important that hey they're trying to push a new
[33:38.000 --> 33:46.000]  thing to outlaw music and they go and use clips of kids joking around on the
[33:46.000 --> 33:50.880]  internet and it's a self-fulfilling prophecy now the media hypes that this
[33:50.880 --> 33:56.120]  is a hardcore drug and puts it out there and then the kids make more videos
[33:56.120 --> 34:02.480]  joking about it and then the media and the police actually believe it but let's
[34:02.480 --> 34:06.920]  talk about something that's real back in the 1940s this is of course been
[34:06.920 --> 34:14.480]  released back at the time they would flash the image of a desert up during
[34:14.480 --> 34:20.840]  the movies with an image of a Coca-Cola an ice-cold Coca-Cola dripping
[34:20.840 --> 34:27.400]  condensation with with water droplets on the outside of the bottle and they
[34:27.400 --> 34:32.440]  found a doubling or more of people rushing out and buying Coca-Cola in the
[34:32.440 --> 34:36.680]  middle of the movie because when it's up there for just a millisecond the
[34:36.680 --> 34:41.880]  subconscious mind fully accepts it but the conscious mind cannot monitor it and
[34:41.880 --> 34:47.560]  understand what it's seen and so that's why they all have you know all these
[34:47.560 --> 34:51.760]  flashing images on television that's why they will up the volume during
[34:51.760 --> 34:56.280]  commercials shopping malls nationwide it's been admitted for more than 20
[34:56.280 --> 35:02.920]  years do have subliminal relaxing music playing in the background and you can't
[35:02.920 --> 35:09.040]  really call it mind control a casinos have been caught doing this it's just a
[35:09.040 --> 35:12.760]  way to set the atmosphere I mean is it mind control when you go to a nice
[35:12.760 --> 35:16.760]  hotel and they have a bouquet of flowers that you can smell and the wood
[35:16.760 --> 35:22.680]  tables are all polished and there's marble floors and ornate paintings on
[35:22.680 --> 35:27.880]  the walls is that a drug when you go and see a beautiful vista like the Grand
[35:27.880 --> 35:32.200]  Canyon is that a drug when you go to the seashore and see a sunrise is that a
[35:32.200 --> 35:38.120]  drug no we know what beauty is we know what is good when I'm driving through
[35:38.120 --> 35:42.440]  the countryside and I see beautiful little farms and rows of corn and wheat
[35:42.440 --> 35:48.380]  and a farmer on a red tractor it just makes you feel good to see humans
[35:48.380 --> 35:54.760]  involved in agriculture I mean do goats are goats under mind control when they
[35:54.760 --> 35:59.320]  look across a valley and see green fields and they happily shake their
[35:59.320 --> 36:02.960]  tails and go down the hill and up the mountain to eat the grass no the grass
[36:02.960 --> 36:09.320]  looks good to them because their brain knows what is good but when you go into
[36:09.320 --> 36:14.200]  a depressed neighborhood with crackheads and unhappy people and rundown houses
[36:14.200 --> 36:19.680]  and paint peeling off walls and poor children playing in mud puddles with
[36:19.680 --> 36:26.480]  scraggly clothes you feel bad it's not a drug so they're literally trying to say
[36:26.480 --> 36:29.840]  don't get sunlight it's a conspiracy theory it's good for you when it's
[36:29.840 --> 36:34.040]  admitted it's what you need or you'll get cancer and become depressed and get
[36:34.040 --> 36:39.120]  MS and so many other issues they know this now they're trying to move to
[36:39.120 --> 36:45.480]  even since CPS after parents that let their kids get a suntan all of this is
[36:45.480 --> 36:48.200]  happening meanwhile they're putting sodium fluoride in the water that attacks
[36:48.200 --> 36:53.040]  every organ reduces fertility or causes full sterilization attacks all organs
[36:53.040 --> 36:57.160]  more than doubles bone cancer and men and women more than quadruples in young
[36:57.160 --> 37:02.120]  boys they are wanting to put lithium a toxic metal in the water to perfect you
[37:02.120 --> 37:07.520]  so you're more passive they want you to watch more television and there are
[37:07.520 --> 37:13.080]  literally scores of studies here's one BBC from 2001 just type in Alzheimer's
[37:13.080 --> 37:17.880]  television it's both the sedentary lifestyle and that it puts you into a
[37:17.880 --> 37:22.040]  sleep state and the average adult watches more than four and a half hours of
[37:22.040 --> 37:28.680]  television a day more than four and a half hours of television a day the youth
[37:28.680 --> 37:32.600]  are watching upwards of eight hours when you combine video games and video games
[37:32.600 --> 37:36.320]  are even worse for some reason the concentration while you're in the lower
[37:36.320 --> 37:41.360]  brainwave state associated with sleep brings you actually into an unnatural
[37:41.360 --> 37:44.840]  level this is major studies that have come out even wired magazines reported
[37:44.840 --> 37:49.240]  when you play video games for a couple hours you then go into a oxygen-starved
[37:49.240 --> 37:54.320]  level that you only get in the deepest areas of sleep when you're having sleep
[37:54.320 --> 37:59.120]  apnea or you've got your face in the pillow and aren't properly breathing so
[37:59.120 --> 38:04.720]  it puts you into a serious brain damage state here it is TV link to Alzheimer's
[38:04.720 --> 38:08.240]  watching too much television and doing too little physical activity could be
[38:08.240 --> 38:11.560]  linked to Alzheimer's disease according to US researchers a study looked at the
[38:11.560 --> 38:15.880]  hobbies of a group of people with Alzheimer's compared to a healthy group
[38:15.880 --> 38:21.360]  Dr. Robert Freiland said watching TV was the only recreational activity out of
[38:21.360 --> 38:25.480]  those study that Alzheimer's suffers were more likely to participate in and the
[38:25.480 --> 38:28.680]  studies also show when you're watching a lot of television you're not outside
[38:28.680 --> 38:32.680]  you're not getting fresh air you're not getting sunlight that's connected to
[38:32.680 --> 38:38.240]  dementia and Alzheimer's in the new London Guardian report out today with a
[38:38.240 --> 38:43.320]  bunch of different scientific studies insufficient exposure to sunshine
[38:43.320 --> 38:47.920]  resulting in low levels of vitamin D that's only part of it plays a role in a
[38:47.920 --> 38:51.720]  wide range of diseases from multiple sclerosis to rheumatoid arthritis type
[38:51.720 --> 38:58.640]  one diabetes cancers dementia scientists say today dementia basically
[38:58.640 --> 39:04.120]  Alzheimer's all of this is happening and it's a cocktail and the social
[39:04.120 --> 39:08.280]  engineers they don't want you outside they don't want you exercising every
[39:08.280 --> 39:14.440]  study shows it is buoying it is mind-altering when I've had family in
[39:14.440 --> 39:18.760]  the hospital or family that's died and I'm depressed I'll just go out and
[39:18.760 --> 39:24.440]  hike five miles boom I'm still upset but not depressed you got a hike you got a
[39:24.440 --> 39:29.720]  exercise you've got a kayak you've got a bicycle even if it's 30 minutes you know
[39:29.720 --> 39:35.040]  a day you've got to do it you've got to get outside you're designed to live
[39:35.040 --> 39:41.640]  outside you're designed to love music good music that's not a drug let's finish
[39:41.640 --> 39:49.000]  with this creepy newscast showing teenagers clearly joking around because
[39:49.000 --> 39:52.920]  there are some quacky websites that go get our music you know it'll it'll
[39:52.920 --> 39:56.840]  increase your brain capacity I've seen quacky stuff sold where you buy a
[39:56.840 --> 40:01.520]  flashing light on your computer that ups ups your frequency and can cure
[40:01.520 --> 40:06.240]  things so yeah the government can find quacks claiming that colored lights and
[40:06.240 --> 40:14.200]  music you know is is is a drug it's not but television itself has been
[40:14.200 --> 40:19.440]  weaponized and as overlapping fields of fire with subliminals flashing lights
[40:19.440 --> 40:23.520]  semantical deceptions all of it but let's finish up with these newscasts
[40:23.520 --> 40:30.560]  here it is can lead them other places it sounds like this and uses binaural or
[40:30.560 --> 40:34.880]  two-tone technology to alter your brainwaves and mental state Kelly
[40:34.880 --> 40:39.240]  Johnson is a parent and teacher and had never even heard of idosing or digital
[40:39.240 --> 40:45.440]  drugs until now just scary definitely scary to know that you know just one
[40:45.440 --> 40:50.160]  more thing one more thing to look out for recently Mustang public school sent
[40:50.160 --> 40:53.840]  out a letter warning parents about the new trend after several high school
[40:53.840 --> 40:57.840]  students reported having physiological effects after trying one of these
[40:57.840 --> 41:02.240]  digital downloads students and graduates are still talking about all right
[41:02.240 --> 41:07.440]  that's enough so they take some YouTube videos of people joking they put an
[41:07.440 --> 41:14.160]  image of bath on that up on the screen and they say tones like or techno music
[41:14.160 --> 41:22.560]  and again there's some truth to it music sports all the studies have shown mass
[41:22.560 --> 41:26.640]  psychology when you're in a crowd of people even intellectuals and highly
[41:26.640 --> 41:31.720]  intelligent people who have strong wills can get sucked in to mob psychology but
[41:31.720 --> 41:37.120]  this is just part of being human and it's the suggestibility of these youth who
[41:37.120 --> 41:40.200]  have been trained and brought up on television remember about a decade ago
[41:40.200 --> 41:45.680]  Pokemon there were massive seizures in Japan and the US whenever they would
[41:45.680 --> 41:50.240]  have flashing strobing lights with the children but they found in the studies
[41:50.240 --> 41:54.440]  that it was only after hours of television viewing did the children get
[41:54.440 --> 42:00.200]  into a suggestible enough state to then have convulsions and that was
[42:00.200 --> 42:06.200]  government-designed programming so basically the globalist want to be able
[42:06.200 --> 42:10.480]  to do whatever they want to you through music and television and get you into
[42:10.480 --> 42:14.840]  highly suggestible states with the video games and the virtual reality
[42:14.840 --> 42:19.880]  simulator systems I mean there is some truth to it but a very small kernel and
[42:19.880 --> 42:23.840]  they're only targeting the general public that's out there enjoying music and
[42:23.840 --> 42:28.840]  going wow it can change the way I feel but if you go back to World War two they
[42:28.840 --> 42:32.440]  found that large percentages of the troops wouldn't kill somebody up close
[42:32.440 --> 42:36.680]  in trench warfare they found in World War one as well so they they introduced
[42:36.680 --> 42:41.120]  pop-up targets of bad guys to where people would instinctively shoot the
[42:41.120 --> 42:45.480]  bad guys on the firing range and they found that it went from around half of
[42:45.480 --> 42:50.760]  people refusing to shoot up close to only about 10% by Vietnam would just pop
[42:50.760 --> 42:55.600]  up targets only about 10% of troops wouldn't shoot people up close today
[42:55.600 --> 43:00.760]  it's almost a hundred percent and the Pentagon developed games like Doom where
[43:00.760 --> 43:05.080]  you simulate killing people their guts their blood splattering and your brain
[43:05.080 --> 43:10.040]  sees that as real also you see violence increasing after the 1950s and crime
[43:10.040 --> 43:13.800]  increasing as the amount of television increased the amount of viewing and the
[43:13.800 --> 43:17.560]  amount of people watching more television because anybody who's watched a lot of
[43:17.560 --> 43:21.880]  television or movies you've seen hundreds of thousands of simulated
[43:21.880 --> 43:25.320]  murders and killings I mean there's got to be a hundred zombie movies that have
[43:25.320 --> 43:28.840]  come out in the last decade I mean there's got to be more than 10 a year and I
[43:28.840 --> 43:32.520]  remember as a youth I'd watch mild horror movies when I was over at a friend's
[43:32.520 --> 43:37.680]  house and become upset and scared and after I watch movies like Alien and
[43:37.680 --> 43:41.320]  stuff like that and got scared now it doesn't scare me because I've become
[43:41.320 --> 43:46.640]  desensitized to it and so what the government and the corporate media has
[43:46.640 --> 43:52.040]  done is mind control at so many levels with semantics how they twist words the
[43:52.040 --> 43:56.560]  flashing lights the music the manipulation the government coming out
[43:56.560 --> 44:00.280]  after 9-11 and using the fear and the trauma to say we need to torture people
[44:00.280 --> 44:03.680]  including their children in front of them the Washington Post promoted it then
[44:03.680 --> 44:08.280]  fiction like 24 promoted it and now we've been conditioned to accept torture
[44:08.280 --> 44:13.280]  just like we've been conditioned to accept implantable microchips or face
[44:13.280 --> 44:17.480]  scanning or thumb printing to buy and sell and now it's going in everywhere so
[44:17.480 --> 44:22.680]  it's really just acclimation that's going on but the fact that they're hyping
[44:22.680 --> 44:27.040]  all of this is ridiculous and now I've spent much of the hour on this subject
[44:27.040 --> 44:33.120]  but I think it's been a worthwhile area to discuss now let's get into what we
[44:33.120 --> 44:37.880]  should really be concerned about the forced drugging of water and the end
[44:37.880 --> 44:44.160]  all these other systems in the food and in the air this is out of the register
[44:44.160 --> 44:49.840]  city received citation for not fluoridating water and it goes on the
[44:49.840 --> 44:53.160]  city of Watsonville has been cited by the California Department of Public
[44:53.160 --> 44:56.920]  Health for failure to comply with an order by the state to fluoridate water
[44:56.920 --> 45:00.760]  supply the citation was received by the city Thursday and demands written
[45:00.760 --> 45:05.640]  assurance from the city by August 29th that it will comply and plan and
[45:05.640 --> 45:11.280]  schedule a fluoridation submitted by September 19th City Council Al Smith
[45:11.280 --> 45:14.680]  said the citation appeared to be out of the clear blue we've been in
[45:14.680 --> 45:17.640]  communication with the Department of Health he said I was surprised but this
[45:17.640 --> 45:21.040]  is it fluoridation has been an issue since the City Council first passed a
[45:21.040 --> 45:25.720]  resolution accepting a grant for the fluoride in 2002 fluoridation 2010 work
[45:25.720 --> 45:30.440]  group offer the city 946,000 to fluoridate because the government cares so
[45:30.440 --> 45:34.480]  much about you but in November of last year Watsonville residents concerned
[45:34.480 --> 45:37.920]  about the safety of fluoride past measure s banning all substances from the
[45:37.920 --> 45:40.880]  water not specifically approved by the Food and Drug Administration which
[45:40.880 --> 45:45.000]  includes fluoride and you know have the majority of FDA and EPA scientists
[45:45.000 --> 45:49.640]  going to Congress and saying sodium fluoride causes cancer and is deadly
[45:49.640 --> 45:54.360]  and reduces fertility one part per million can cause up to a 20% on
[45:54.360 --> 46:00.480]  average about 15 IQ reduction people aren't the US IQ is now the lowest in
[46:00.480 --> 46:05.760]  the world not not not our test scores not our laziness not our decadence we're
[46:05.760 --> 46:11.800]  lazy and decadent for a reason for 60 years almost every major city over 70
[46:11.800 --> 46:15.160]  percent of the nation now drinks for native water it passed that number a
[46:15.160 --> 46:20.560]  few years ago you are lethargic and dumbed down and can't focus and have
[46:20.560 --> 46:24.600]  reduced fertility and cancer rates are off the charts for a lot of reasons but
[46:24.600 --> 46:28.760]  the biggest one is fluoridation of water fluoridation of food most processed
[46:28.760 --> 46:32.920]  foods have it at it they now for five years have been spraying it on crops as
[46:32.920 --> 46:37.120]  a pesticide it goes through the cell walls and bio accumulates in the crops
[46:37.120 --> 46:42.120]  this is all admitted we are being dosed with massive amounts of it the toothpaste
[46:42.120 --> 46:46.560]  I was driving in this morning but my iPhone camera is fogged up and screwed
[46:46.560 --> 46:50.000]  up I guess I got to go take it in I couldn't take a photo of a sparklets
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.880]  truck it had a big pink side on the back seeing fluoride water for babies it's
[46:54.880 --> 46:58.520]  even worse for babies statistically the amount of brain damage it causes and
[46:58.520 --> 47:03.360]  they're cold-bloodedly doing this right out in the open yeah their CDC
[47:03.360 --> 47:07.920]  community water fluoridation stats now reaches nearly 70% of u.s. population
[47:07.920 --> 47:11.560]  and when did that come out because the numbers I saw two years ago as we had
[47:11.560 --> 47:17.840]  already passed 70% okay this year so it's just now hitting 70 the report I saw
[47:17.840 --> 47:22.800]  was over 70 thanks for pulling it up guys the issue here is they're racing to
[47:22.800 --> 47:27.240]  get the entire country and entire world fluoridated I've seen cases where five
[47:27.240 --> 47:32.400]  million dollars was spent in a small town in Kansas if I remember correctly
[47:32.400 --> 47:36.600]  just to get them to Florida over a decade they spent millions to get San
[47:36.600 --> 47:40.040]  Antonio to Florida a few years ago the citizens knew what was going on down
[47:40.040 --> 47:46.120]  there okay and now California comes in and says we're gonna criminally come
[47:46.120 --> 47:50.040]  after your city we're gonna cite you if you don't do this since when do they
[47:50.040 --> 47:53.760]  get to forcibly medicate us and now they say hey we want to put statins in the
[47:53.760 --> 47:58.320]  water and we want to put lithium in the water both toxic now they're talking
[47:58.320 --> 48:02.280]  about making kids in public school take statins every week to help their
[48:02.280 --> 48:11.280]  cholesterol they are forced drugging us and they are setting the precedent to
[48:11.280 --> 48:14.200]  do this and they know we're waking people up so they're striking back again
[48:14.200 --> 48:20.120]  here's the male yesterday fury and China as female babies grow breast after
[48:20.120 --> 48:25.080]  drinking milk laced with hormones now here they spend it and go oh it's seven
[48:25.080 --> 48:28.720]  eight year olds by the hundreds of thousands going into puberty when
[48:28.720 --> 48:34.840]  you're supposed to go in at 12 to 14 no no no tens of thousands in the US babies
[48:34.840 --> 48:38.880]  are growing breast three-year-olds are menstruating three-year-old girls and
[48:38.880 --> 48:44.600]  then it burns them out it accelerates their aging and they get massive
[48:44.600 --> 48:48.880]  increases in breast cancer that's all admitted do they take bisphenol a out of
[48:48.880 --> 48:53.360]  almost those plastic products and food no they don't do you know when you
[48:53.360 --> 49:00.080]  microwave something in a bisphenol a tray it massively off gases it into your
[49:00.080 --> 49:04.640]  food I years ago I'd be eating plastic stuff that I'd microwaved it could taste
[49:04.640 --> 49:10.400]  the poison you wonder why you're obese Americans were eating more fattening
[49:10.400 --> 49:14.200]  foods 30 years ago the statistic show but we're fatter and more unhealthy today
[49:14.200 --> 49:19.480]  because of the hormones the bisphenol a the sodium fluoride attacks the thyroid
[49:19.480 --> 49:24.560]  ladies and gentlemen it's epidemic amongst women every time I'm sitting in
[49:24.560 --> 49:30.120]  a restaurant or go to church with my parents or just constantly all I hear
[49:30.120 --> 49:34.840]  women talking about is yeah I'm 25 years old and the doctor says I've got an 80
[49:34.840 --> 49:38.800]  year-old thyroid and no matter yeah but he's giving me hormones discipline to
[49:38.800 --> 49:48.800]  help fluoride savages your thyroid women bisphenol a savages your thyroid honey
[49:48.800 --> 49:52.720]  you're not supposed to be fat on the small diet you're eating you're not
[49:52.720 --> 49:57.320]  supposed to have your hair fallen out at 25 honey most the women I know above the

[54:31.760 --> 54:37.360]  my list correctly by the way I went to Target this weekend with my wife to buy
[54:37.360 --> 54:42.520]  some pots and pans and we noticed that almost all of the Tupperware is now
[54:42.520 --> 54:51.480]  glass because people are now aware of the fact that buys phenol A is deadly so
[54:51.480 --> 54:56.320]  your purchases are making them convert almost completely over to glass if you
[54:56.320 --> 55:00.160]  start demanding that from other manufacturers we can beat this together
[55:00.160 --> 55:05.280]  with our purchases but here's an example I've asked the folks here to buy paper
[55:05.280 --> 55:11.200]  cups for coffee and they usually have it but I'm so weak-minded that when they do
[55:11.200 --> 55:16.760]  buy buys phenol A laced cups and I pour hot coffee into it and it leaches I
[55:16.760 --> 55:22.440]  still come in and drink the poison like Romans lining their wine jugs with lead
[55:22.440 --> 55:30.200]  I bought a vitamin water that's got buys phenol A reportedly in the plastic and
[55:30.200 --> 55:33.960]  drink it when I was getting gas this morning because I was thirsty I'm weak
[55:33.960 --> 55:38.840]  minded none of us are perfect this stuff is laid everywhere for us but at
[55:38.840 --> 55:44.880]  least keep your children away from this stuff okay I'm not perfect people say
[55:44.880 --> 55:47.920]  well why did you just admit you're drinking on a buys phenol A you idiot
[55:47.920 --> 55:52.840]  I'm pointing out how I can't stay conscious of this but you know what for
[55:52.840 --> 55:57.120]  my children for when they go to school they're their homeschool but they go to
[55:57.120 --> 56:02.520]  an academy that's two days a week for homeschoolers we have glass where for
[56:02.520 --> 56:08.480]  them at least I'm doing that there's no plastic that my children drink out of
[56:08.480 --> 56:14.360]  those little paper juice boxes lined with buys phenol A you've got to do it
[56:14.360 --> 56:19.080]  or it's going to screw up your sons and screw up your daughter so at least at
[56:19.080 --> 56:24.560]  least I'm doing that for my children and I'm trying to train myself to not
[56:24.560 --> 56:28.880]  ever eat fast food to not ever eat processed foods to not drink out of
[56:28.880 --> 56:32.920]  these poisons and I've got a bunch of other news on this subject we're gonna

[59:01.320 --> 59:05.200]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[59:05.200 --> 59:08.880]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[59:08.880 --> 59:13.440]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[59:13.440 --> 59:17.480]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[59:17.480 --> 59:21.240]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[59:21.240 --> 59:24.880]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[59:24.880 --> 59:29.240]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:33.640]  demigod go ahead you can hear me right Alex that correct I can hear you loud and
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:40.440]  clear from the Emerald Isle fantastic Alex said I've been a prison planet TV
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.560]  member for a little while now and I've been listening to you for about five
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:49.680]  years and I'm really really impressed with what you're doing I'd like to
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:53.280]  really thank you first of all for the position that you're taking on the mosque
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:59.200]  issue because this is really an issue of property rights and free speech
[01:01:59.200 --> 01:02:04.480]  essentially and well I took that from the beginning but now we know the number
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:09.200]  two shareholder in Fox is the main funder of this imam who's building the
[01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:14.120]  mosque the imam is hooked in with the FBI trilateral Commission CFR top
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:20.000]  globalist this whole thing is staged to demonize Muslims well that's what I was
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:25.120]  calling about actually I'm a Muslim myself and I went to the Muslim
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:30.600]  leaders of tomorrow conference in Qatar held by a held by the the Asthma
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:35.760]  Society the American Society for Muslim Advancement which was created by a
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:44.120]  man fighting and I've seen a lot of the work that he's done the well he may be a
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:49.440]  good guy he may have been a good guy but I'm telling you they the people about it
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:53.840]  was Fox News that first promoted this and notice now they're involved at every
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:58.440]  level so they may have set him up it's just that and and I'm not blaming you
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:01.880]  know him for wanting to be part of the CFR because he gets he thinks he's
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:05.560]  getting connections out of it kind of like Angelina Joe Lee so you see so I
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:11.040]  probably shouldn't judge him but the whole thing itself is a hoax yeah well
[01:03:11.040 --> 01:03:16.000]  what I would say is simply this when it when it comes down to him in
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:22.280]  particular I read the article that he was a globalist
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:26.440]  dude from info wars.com and I think I emailed Steve Watson as I didn't get a
[01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:31.560]  response and what I said is I'll go and I'll see what I can find out and get
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:34.360]  responses for him on that and I'll see if I can get him on your show as well
[01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:39.560]  he's a he's traveling at the moment but I mean if there are questions there and
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.320]  there are things that you want to tell him then I think it's certainly a good
[01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:48.160]  idea to give him the opportunity to to respond to that because listen if you
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:52.920]  can get him on we would do a respectful nice interview and if it turns out that
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:56.440]  he's not a stooge of them and that they're just trying to hype this they're
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.480]  not then I'll apologize for the article. I think you might also find that he
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:05.560]  agrees with you on a lot of the things that you're saying but he may not say
[01:04:05.560 --> 01:04:10.680]  them publicly because the position that he's in at the moment is one where I
[01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:15.880]  mean if he would say a lot of the same things that you'd you do say he'd be
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:19.720]  denied a lot more than than you are especially when trying to build this
[01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:25.760]  message. Well I know it's a very very complex issue and I just it's a
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:28.440]  property right issue and Ron Paul's come out and said it's a property right
[01:04:28.440 --> 01:04:31.800]  issue and I agree with him and if we don't have religious freedom and
[01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:37.640]  property rights in this country we're not a free nation. I think another thing
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.080]  that we need to do as well is start looking at a lot of the Middle Eastern
[01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:44.360]  leadership and how they fit into this new world order. Stay there I want to get
[01:04:44.360 --> 01:04:48.400]  your take adonis on that briefly then we'll go to Mark and everybody else that's

[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:13.720]  war continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:20.160]  Adonis calling us from New Zealand who's a Muslim I think one big reason people
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:27.480]  are so upset about the mosque when they're told well you need to be you
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:32.600]  know eclectic you need to be open land of the free home of the brave inclusive
[01:08:32.600 --> 01:08:35.920]  is that people look at Saudi Arabia where they don't let you build Christian
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:40.520]  churches now in Iraq and almost every other Muslim country people live side
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:44.640]  by side peacefully of course the foreign minister of Iraq was
[01:08:44.640 --> 01:08:50.040]  Tariq Aziz and for a long time Christians and Muslims have lived in peace there
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:53.440]  were of course the wars between Muslims and Christians that went on for
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:59.080]  hundreds of years and you had the Moors taking over much of Spain and all of
[01:08:59.080 --> 01:09:06.280]  that happening so there's that you know old Fisher that's still there and I
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:09.720]  think a lot of people you know get angry with Saudi Arabia itself but you were
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:15.440]  getting into some of the globalist you tied in leaders of the Middle East and
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:21.480]  Central Asia go ahead yeah definitely I mean when you when you look at Saudi
[01:09:21.480 --> 01:09:29.160]  Arabia as a whole I mean the country is a Wahhabi country and it's it's really I
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:33.080]  guess a very fanatical state when you look at its interpretations very
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:36.960]  extreme interpretation of Islam which is a very it's it's quite a minority in
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.440]  the world but when you actually look at the Saudi royal family they actually
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:46.680]  made a deal with the Wahhabists quite some time ago where where they would put
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.760]  this interpretation of Islam it's very puritan very dangerous interpretation of
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:57.360]  Islam it as the law and they would essentially be able to get and be able
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:10:00.640]  to do whatever they want and if you take a look at what they do they're out
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:04.520]  there in Monte Carlo they've got prostitutes they've got drugs they've
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.640]  got alcohol if you see a lot of the students who are who are international
[01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:13.000]  students I've met several of them yeah they're legendarily hypocritical and
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:18.880]  decadent yeah exactly so I mean I can appreciate the position that a lot of
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:23.280]  people take on Saudi Arabia but I mean it's it's probably the worst example well
[01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:27.680]  let's be fair to I mean let's be fair I'm not attacking Saudi Arabia I'm not
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:31.720]  attacking Israel I understand there's complex issues in all these countries but
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:37.800]  take Israel it's against the law to proselytize Christianity in Israel now
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:44.600]  there are old churches that are kind of like licensed travel agents but but but
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:49.000]  you're you will be arrested in Israel if you proselytize so all these Muslim
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.640]  bashers that are mad at Saudi Arabia I can see their point that's a form of
[01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:56.680]  tyranny but why don't we talk about what Israel does I mean let's be fair about
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:11:03.400]  this in Israel you get arrested if you're non-Jewish and you marry a Jew in fact
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:07.840]  Google that you know Israel makes it illegal to marry a Jew for non-Jews to
[01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:13.640]  marry Jews so so Israel in many respects is almost as extreme as Saudi Arabia but
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:17.120]  no one wants to talk about this everybody wants to keep that a secret and
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:21.800]  again I'm not here bashing Israel you know I just want to point out these
[01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:27.960]  hypocrisies and then also point out that when the US gets criticized for what
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:32.680]  I would call mild type discrimination that we need to measure it according to
[01:11:32.680 --> 01:11:36.680]  what other people are doing and then ask why is it that the United States is
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:40.640]  always you know called out for things that are much more mild than some other
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:44.760]  countries and I'm saying they're good I'm not saying that crazed crowd chasing a
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:49.640]  black man and yelling and cussing at him because he was wearing a sweat hat he
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:53.080]  was a Christian by the way with an American flag necklace he said I'm not a
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:56.960]  Muslim but even if he was a Muslim they shouldn't have been verbally attacking
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.760]  him and then chased him off so it shows this dangerous crazed animosity is
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:06.880]  building go ahead and finish up yeah I agree with you a hundred percent you know
[01:12:06.880 --> 01:12:11.900]  when you when you take a look at the way that the rest of the world is in
[01:12:11.900 --> 01:12:16.280]  comparison to the US you see that the US actually has a really good deal and if
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:20.760]  you want to take an example in Australia there's a lot of problems between
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:28.200]  Lebanese youth and and Anglo-Australian youth and on one situation in 2005 some
[01:12:28.200 --> 01:12:34.160]  Lebanese youth beat up a lifeguard on the beach and the weekend afterwards
[01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:40.000]  5,000 drunk angry Anglo-Australians went and beat up every Arab they could find
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:45.240]  they rioted where the US where they had the 9-11 attacks and unfortunately a
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:49.200]  lot of people still believe it's it's the Muslims or etc who did it when we
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:54.280]  know it was an inside job but there was no riots like that and I and this is
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:58.160]  what I continue to say to people though if you want to call America racist you
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:01.720]  look at the example of what happened there there's been unflinching tolerance
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:06.000]  and restraint after that and a lot of understanding too and I think when you
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:10.620]  look at the example of the Middle East what they do and a lot of these
[01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:14.480]  extremists and I've dealt with extremists I did prison chaplaincy had to
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:18.520]  do with terrorist suspects and people were eventually found guilty their
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:23.520]  mindset is they look at the US and they try and make this a war between Islam
[01:13:23.520 --> 01:13:28.760]  and the West the West well let's expand though over and over again Al Qaeda puts
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:32.920]  out statements saying we want Iran to be attacked because their Wahhabist is their
[01:13:32.920 --> 01:13:37.320]  real mode they want to go after the Shiites but also on top of that they
[01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:42.120]  want to stir Muslims up and have this clash because from their foundation they
[01:13:42.120 --> 01:13:46.320]  have been funded radical Muslims this is just a fact have been funded by the
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:52.440]  British and others it's just like Israel admits they founded Hamas in 1975 to try
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:56.520]  to create division Adonis we could talk all day interesting points but I
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:04.960]  appreciate your perspective and at the end of the day we're told we're giving
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:10.760]  up our liberties to fight the Muslim menace as the media puts it but almost
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:15.400]  all of the real architecture of this police state is pointed at libertarians
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:20.360]  gun owners conservatives returning veterans so that's the main message you
[01:14:20.360 --> 01:14:23.600]  know you may hate Muslims and think they want to come and you know drink your
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.720]  blood or whatever and they're like vampires if that's your view that's you
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:32.000]  know you can have that view my issue is that this whole police state isn't even
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:36.040]  being built for them so you need to understand you've been conned and and
[01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:39.120]  you know that's what I have to say at the end of the day here but I know that
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:42.560]  Muslims are an incredibly diverse group just like Christians are just like
[01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:46.440]  they're radical Hindus that go around bombing and killing people that's the
[01:14:46.440 --> 01:14:50.960]  radicals and the statement that you know all of Islam wants to kill everybody
[01:14:50.960 --> 01:14:55.720]  isn't true I'm done talking about it the point is let's go ahead and talk to
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:15:01.960]  Mark and Idaho mark you're on the air welcome hi Alex here in Boise Idaho the
[01:15:01.960 --> 01:15:05.840]  economy is getting bad to the point the homeless shelters are turning people away
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:10.120]  according to my sources in the homeless population no I've seen statistics on
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:13.600]  that and in California they're now picking up the homeless at night and
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:18.080]  taking them to sports stadium centers which is the beginning of the camps I
[01:15:18.080 --> 01:15:22.880]  agree with that assessment Alex which is why I'm scared about a new piece of
[01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:27.920]  HUD legislation called Petra basically what it does is that it privatizes all
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:34.640]  housing programs and from what I've seen in Russia today the housing advocacy
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:39.880]  people are concerned that this will displace a lot more people
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:45.640]  absolutely you're having the core services cut like streets and police and
[01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:51.680]  fire and and then the taxes are going up to pay interest to the private bankers
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:55.480]  that engineered the collapse this is their takeover program they've done in
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:16:00.040]  every nation and it's done by design we have the IMF World Bank documents we have
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:05.640]  new it was actually in Bloomberg new memos from Goldman Sachs about how
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:09.040]  they're engineering things and anybody that says they're not engineering this
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:17.840]  is wrong I've also heard other from the taxi cab drivers in downtown Boise how
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:23.040]  construction sites are even being abandoned because apparently the
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:27.920]  construction companies are having their assets freeze by the banks let me raise
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:34.840]  that since you brought it up here's AP today home sales plunged 27% to lowest
[01:16:34.840 --> 01:16:39.600]  in 15 years sales of previously occupied homes plunged last month the lowest of
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.240]  15 years despite the lowest mortgage rates in decades and bargain prices in
[01:16:43.240 --> 01:16:47.000]  many areas people can't get the loans or they're not comfortable doing it
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.240]  July sales fell more than 27% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
[01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:56.720]  3.83 million the National Association of Realtors said Tuesday was the largest
[01:16:56.720 --> 01:17:02.000]  monthly drop on record dating back to 1968 and sharp declines were recorded in
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:06.640]  all regions of the country the plunge in home sales also magnified fears about
[01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:14.840]  the broader economy so yes the economy is in freefall okay and from what I keep
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:23.480]  hearing from people on housing is that not only not only are they concerned
[01:17:23.480 --> 01:17:30.240]  about losing their homes that they're concerned that they can't really support
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:35.880]  any of their families at all and I host my own talk show and one of my hosts is
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:42.400]  on housing and he tells me that he has to go into the U.S. military because he
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:50.840]  is he can't afford to keep his kids in the vicarious situation that he's in my
[01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:55.080]  friend I hear you and I'm sorry to hear that that's happening let's go ahead and
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:59.000]  talk to Essa in North Carolina you're on the air
[01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:05.720]  hi doing Alex good sir okay I have one question two points okay have you ever
[01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:12.080]  heard of a lady called Maria Montessori you're the Montessori teachers
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:17.920]  Association and my two points is if you know if men want to keep their test
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:23.040]  testosterone levels up you know get plenty of zinc and you're right about
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:27.680]  the you know playing the video games because they they can really take a lot
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:36.920]  out are you talking about Montessori yeah Montessori yes yes it's a little new
[01:18:36.920 --> 01:18:41.080]  AG but it's better than public school I've investigated it when my children
[01:18:41.080 --> 01:18:46.440]  were in preschool for about a year I put them in Montessori and I didn't take
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:50.160]  them out because I was really unhappy with it we just thought we could do a
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:54.560]  better education more classical it was actually less than a year about a
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:19:00.680]  semester or a little more and they just wanted to be with us but Montessori
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:05.000]  varies from school to school from what I've seen my sister went to Montessori
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:10.920]  in preschool and she graduated with high marks in college you know so I mean it
[01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:15.880]  it worked well for her it was pretty good because yeah because I mean because you
[01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:19.640]  know I investigated you know that Maria because because I know is that you is
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:23.600]  are the you win are they are are they sponsor on that program you know I
[01:19:23.600 --> 01:19:29.160]  don't know enough about it again we've been I I think the straw that broke the

[01:24:29.120 --> 01:24:35.600]  scottie in california you're on the air welcome I thank you Alex a really big
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:40.240]  fan of yours been been prison playing that TV member for about two years you've
[01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:44.520]  really woke me up I'm sure you're here to burn a lot because I talk about you
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:48.080]  all the time I want to agree with you about what you were talking about this
[01:24:48.080 --> 01:24:51.440]  morning with subliminals and the binaural beats I used to play with that
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:57.000]  about 20 years ago myself and then yesterday you'd asked us what we thought
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  government's biggest lie is and of course I think besides the official land
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:08.760]  11 story free energy I'm sure Nikola Tesla had all kinds of patents back in
[01:25:08.760 --> 01:25:15.280]  the early 1900s that we would probably have free energy now and that would
[01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:21.840]  probably destroy the whole money power structure if energy was free well
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.760]  regardless we need to get rid of the private fell reserve and have a
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:28.680]  national debate about the money system we want and to get it back under
[01:25:28.680 --> 01:25:33.800]  congress as it's meant to be under law and you know exposing them is half the
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:37.320]  battle and then having a national debate about what type of currency we want
[01:25:37.320 --> 01:25:43.160]  gold back or fiat that's up to we the people that control the congress right
[01:25:43.160 --> 01:25:46.520]  right but what do you think about like alternative energies like a hydrogen
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:50.680]  production I've actually put a couple of stainless steel wall plates together
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:55.400]  with a battery and some water and have actually well but here's the deal what
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:26:00.760]  I've confirmed is in the 70s general motors and others the Japanese as well
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:05.560]  had systems that would give you a car that could drive 120 miles an hour and
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:10.760]  would get over 50 miles per gallon fuel efficiency so they've got deals with the
[01:26:10.760 --> 01:26:14.640]  oil companies not I mean these are patented these are on record by the
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:18.560]  auto companies they go buy them up they've got all sorts of zero point
[01:26:18.560 --> 01:26:22.280]  energy all sorts of other things they've been suppressing and then all the
[01:26:22.280 --> 01:26:28.280]  fake green energy like wind and things doesn't supply any of what you need and
[01:26:28.280 --> 01:26:32.280]  and and its cost prohibitive and actually cost two jobs for every job it
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:39.080]  makes so yes there is an attempt to block out true energy independence and then
[01:26:39.080 --> 01:26:44.680]  create a fake clone of it of limited systems that the globalist control so
[01:26:44.680 --> 01:26:49.920]  yes energy obviously is key the globalist are racing in to buy up water
[01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:54.160]  supplies and then restrict water they're really hyping that the privatization
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:59.800]  of water so I mean it's all paramount I actually have Tommy Pilotta has made a
[01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:04.920]  new interactive film slash website slash book that he's going to premiere in the
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:09.840]  next two weeks here on this radio show and it's going to be free the premiere
[01:27:09.840 --> 01:27:14.960]  of it to my listeners so we're very excited about that it's all about the
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:19.720]  energy conspiracy with us of course celebrated filmmaker and researcher
[01:27:19.720 --> 01:27:25.680]  Tommy Pilotta films like scanner darkly waking life slacker he's in that good
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:29.640]  friend of mine he's over over in Europe right now but he's going to be on the
[01:27:29.640 --> 01:27:32.600]  show in the next two weeks we are lining that up right now so that should be
[01:27:32.600 --> 01:27:37.200]  very exciting well I thank you for everything you do Alex I'm a big fan
[01:27:37.200 --> 01:27:42.560]  and you're my hero keep up the good work brother you're my hero the the the
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:47.560]  willingness to resist oppression and to wake up our fellow humans that is the
[01:27:47.560 --> 01:27:52.680]  heroic idea we are all together we're all brothers and arms sisters and arms
[01:27:52.680 --> 01:27:59.480]  let's talk to Jim and Oregon you're on the air Jim good morning Alex you know
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:04.480]  I think one of the soft underbellies of the globalist is the China trade there
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:09.000]  is that is affecting our economy big time and nobody's talking about you know
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:12.160]  that's the leg that's cut off and they want to put a tourniquet on it their
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:16.560]  answer is more globalism let's hack the other leg off and slit our throat and
[01:28:16.560 --> 01:28:22.160]  stab us 15 times in the heart but the China trade with the inequities you know
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:26.400]  the thirty percent nine percent of our manufacturing has been off short on
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.480]  countless number of jobs have never been created in America let's be clear it's
[01:28:30.480 --> 01:28:35.080]  not free or fair trade they have no environmental standards they keep their
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:39.760]  currency lower than ours which is a trade imbalance a form of tariff there's
[01:28:39.760 --> 01:28:43.600]  tax incentives by our government to move over there their people have the slave
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:47.680]  wages and so of course it's a giant sucking sound like Ross Perot said you
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:52.760]  know Mexico can't even compete with China and India so it's imploding go ahead
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:58.960]  well I think that that affects so many people in America you listen to cease
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:03.600]  ban in the morning whatever trade comes up everybody's saying that China trade
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:09.880]  of NAFTA this pony free trade is bad and yet the elites the globalists they
[01:29:09.880 --> 01:29:13.840]  don't want to touch it because it's consolidating power for them but we
[01:29:13.840 --> 01:29:18.360]  look we can do one thing we can stop buying Chinese and that doesn't mean
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:23.520]  that occasionally you don't have a choice but but when you have a chance to
[01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:28.680]  buy American made light bulbs or jeans or water filters sponsors we have when
[01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:32.720]  you have a chance or even things that have American made components just like
[01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:37.680]  five years ago you couldn't find glassware Tupperware now it's displacing
[01:29:37.680 --> 01:29:42.840]  at least a target I saw almost all of its class now because people want it

[01:39:07.720 --> 01:39:11.720]  the website to confirm the phone number for those that don't know tell folks
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:16.960]  where Carver's Bay is Carver's Bay is a small or is one of our small high
[01:39:16.960 --> 01:39:22.440]  schools in rural Georgetown County South Carolina and it's I want to say that
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.000]  now that's one of more of our magnet schools where we've who it was a
[01:39:26.000 --> 01:39:31.400]  predominantly black community aboard next to adjacent to a predominantly white
[01:39:31.400 --> 01:39:34.400]  community and I think and they want to feed them into the they want to feed them
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:38.360]  into the meat grinder and so they're playing on their on the perception that
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:42.640]  they're ignorant by the way this is in LA this is in Chicago this is in some
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:47.640]  Texas towns I've been seeing this for about 12 years and they've they've set
[01:39:47.640 --> 01:39:51.440]  up the draft boards again the Pentagon's put out four different reports I've seen
[01:39:51.440 --> 01:39:55.520]  and I've even seen c-span debates where they're saying we need a national draft
[01:39:55.520 --> 01:39:59.840]  Wrangles been proposing it they've got the legislation introduced we talk about
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.040]  it they call it a conspiracy theory but what they do is this came out in
[01:40:03.040 --> 01:40:07.160]  Houston and in Denver Colorado you can pull up the newscast where the parents
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:11.400]  would record it and and they make everybody join ROTC in the ninth grade
[01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:16.440]  they say you must do it it's not elective and then they come in and threaten
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:20.920]  them and say just sign this commitment form at 18 it doesn't mean you have to
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:26.560]  join the Army or the Marine Corps at 18 and then they graduate and it turns out
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:30.680]  that they trick them but under law you can't get an underage person to commit
[01:40:30.680 --> 01:40:34.680]  so they then trick them and say it's the law you've got to do it and it's the
[01:40:34.680 --> 01:40:38.480]  phone calls we've played them here ago and listen you little bastard you're
[01:40:38.480 --> 01:40:43.240]  gonna go to prison if you don't show up down here right now you're in the core
[01:40:43.240 --> 01:40:48.840]  now boy and then the Army guy in Denver he got promoted for threatening people
[01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:51.920]  so if you want to join the military that's your issue and be shot up with
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:56.040]  vaccines good folks in the military but they're using legal wars but this is
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:59.640]  part of the mind control your phone sounds like an electric razor but your

[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:08.640]  minute thanks for bringing it up finish up with with what the community's
[01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:12.520]  saying then I'll cover the story okay well now in South Carolina we do have
[01:41:12.520 --> 01:41:15.960]  compulsory service in the state militia but this is definitely not the state
[01:41:15.960 --> 01:41:19.680]  militia what they're doing with the federal military program and we're
[01:41:19.680 --> 01:41:24.040]  pushing the local tea parties to join us to go out there and protest at the if
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:28.120]  they will not establish a standalone PE class and restore the PE class that
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:32.600]  this normally would be this is a co-opting of the PE class into another

[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:09.120]  our own citizens then we should not be willing to use it in a wartime situation
[01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:13.040]  Wayne said there it is AP and let me see if I was right it was four years ago
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:17.120]  yes 2006 okay there we go people can't believe I just know all these statistics
[01:47:17.120 --> 01:47:21.120]  and numbers over the years I think I just make this up so so now when I say
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:25.840]  something we show it to you and I call the year I call the time this is not
[01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:31.000]  pre-programmed this is not prescriptive I'm just here firing this out you know
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:36.000]  baseball scores from five years ago you can learn this too I'm not special okay
[01:47:36.000 --> 01:47:41.080]  this is what I'm obsessed with so I'm I'm intelligent informed about it you can
[01:47:41.080 --> 01:47:44.920]  too you can break your conditioning you can learn about how the world works you
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:48.360]  can literally tell everything that's going on with your local police when
[01:47:48.360 --> 01:47:50.920]  they don't even know because they're compartmentalized you can study the
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:57.280]  entire operation officials unveil high-tech ray gun to be installed in
[01:47:57.280 --> 01:48:02.880]  the county jail and this is in how do you pronounce this
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:09.360]  castatic that right castatic it goes on a high-tech ray gun built for the
[01:48:09.360 --> 01:48:14.600]  military that fires an invisible heat beam capable of causing unbearable pain
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:19.800]  where's Marvin the Martian my strontium 12 detonator disintegrate the pesky earth
[01:48:19.800 --> 01:48:25.160]  creature a high-tech ray gun built for the military that fires an invisible
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:30.560]  heat beam capable of causing unbearable pain will be tested on on really inmates
[01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:35.400]  and the sheriff's detention facility officials had Friday in unveiling a
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:40.840]  vent and if you give me a document cam shot on this they're really enjoying
[01:48:40.840 --> 01:48:46.280]  that if you zoom in on that there he is oh we'll have this mounted in the jail
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:50.920]  and just fry everyone with pleasure I mean why not we already naked body
[01:48:50.920 --> 01:48:54.960]  scanning the slaves with high-powered radiation and then save all the images
[01:48:54.960 --> 01:48:59.000]  we're already stealing all the baby's blood for 38 years globally in a huge
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:04.960]  DNA eugenics cold springs harbor by a weapon program why not start frying
[01:49:04.960 --> 01:49:10.080]  people of course that's how you deal with them
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:16.520]  pesky earth creatures that a pretty good Marvin the Martian I can do others
[01:49:16.520 --> 01:49:20.800]  I'm trying to be in a good mood the guys pointed out to me yesterday that I I'm
[01:49:20.800 --> 01:49:24.760]  really stressed I'm really too serious all the time I don't know listeners do

[01:49:37.760 --> 01:49:45.200]  into totals servile thumb-sucking you know la la land and it goes on to say the
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:49.960]  assault intervention system developed by Raytheon Co you know I love how the city
[01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:54.040]  of Austin is buying stuff from Raytheon other big companies hundreds of
[01:49:54.040 --> 01:49:58.280]  thousands some cases millions of dollars battle droids that's really what
[01:49:58.280 --> 01:50:03.760]  they're for bomb droids face scanning cameras license plate scanning cameras
[01:50:03.760 --> 01:50:10.000]  face scanners microphones listening to us for 12 years and now they admit yes
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:13.920]  we're listening to you yes we're face scanning you yes we're listening to you
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:18.640]  yes we've got I've got a few they're testing I've got this from a fusion
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:22.920]  center source this is really upset this is breaking they actually have mounted
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:28.320]  on these 360 shotgun mic camera systems that scan license plates read faces
[01:50:28.320 --> 01:50:34.000]  they've actually got long-distance lasers where they can at thousands of
[01:50:34.000 --> 01:50:38.360]  yards away with these low intensity lasers so they're very hard to see during
[01:50:38.360 --> 01:50:42.120]  the day if there's mist at night you can see them they shoot it at your window

[01:54:31.480 --> 01:54:36.280]  depression is helping get rid of our carbon footprint and next we'll talk
[01:54:36.280 --> 01:54:39.440]  about how school children are being trained to keep their parents in line
[01:54:39.440 --> 01:54:45.640]  isn't that nice let's go to another reporter hi I'm a soothing little snake
[01:54:45.640 --> 01:54:52.560]  go to sleep everyone okay no I'm here to tell you wake up this is your wake up
[01:54:52.560 --> 01:55:01.040]  call let's go down to TJ in Minnesota TJ you're on the air Alex Jones you got
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:07.480]  me going in six different expertise areas I forgot what I was calling you
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:11.800]  about but I think it was salmonella and chickens I'm a chicken expert but I'm
[01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:16.040]  not a salmonella expert and there's something stinky billions of eggs
[01:55:16.040 --> 01:55:19.960]  recalls from yeah well here's a deep reddit in the Des Moines register this
[01:55:19.960 --> 01:55:27.080]  morning a politician from Connecticut called an Iowa egg farmer and asked him
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:34.360]  what he knew about salmonella and of course he didn't know spit so they sent a
[01:55:34.360 --> 01:55:40.280]  bunch of fed agents out and they found some salmonella like fine and you know
[01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:48.720]  anthrax or poop in a toilet bowl and so they're putting a bad name on eggs now
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:54.520]  for some unknown purpose but you haven't hit on it much and I want you to find a
[01:55:54.520 --> 01:56:00.080]  poultry chicken-loving veterinarian to tell you the scoop about what's going on
[01:56:00.080 --> 01:56:06.600]  in Iowa because it sounds like it's another big fed corp oh well what they
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:13.040]  always do is especially with Tyson who has you know a near monopoly over poultry
[01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:17.480]  production globally not just here but in Asia Europe in the United States North
[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:22.320]  America they always use these things to selectively put in more regulations that
[01:56:22.320 --> 01:56:25.760]  are then selectively enforced against people that aren't part of the mega
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:30.920]  monopolies and it is a medium-sized operator that are saying is the main
[01:56:30.920 --> 01:56:36.200]  culprit in this but I find it hard to you know understand how you could have
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:42.360]  such a huge recall it's just like the spinach with all of the E. Coli and they
[01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:46.360]  could never really find out what was doing that but look you know the more
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:50.240]  government we pay for the less but but meanwhile they've got enforcers everywhere
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:54.040]  to shut down small family farms that are selling stuff on the side of the road
[01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:58.880]  or small farms selling their own milk or eggs or cheese they've got plenty of
[01:56:58.880 --> 01:57:02.640]  undercover enforcers for that but not to go into these big factories but I'll
[01:57:02.640 --> 01:57:07.320]  look into it TJ appreciate your call let's talk to Jack in PA you're on the
[01:57:07.320 --> 01:57:17.680]  air Jack calling Jack from the moon I'm sorry go ahead Jackie there Jack's gone

[01:57:29.880 --> 01:57:36.840]  Tennessee hello Alex Jones hey buddy Barza yes I was calling in a couple
[01:57:36.840 --> 01:57:42.440]  different things here I talked to you first time when I was telling you that
[01:57:42.440 --> 01:57:47.280]  I had a allergic reaction to electric magnet magnetic frequencies and you
[01:57:47.280 --> 01:57:50.760]  asked me why I was still using my mobile phone as well at the time I didn't know
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:54.120]  it but I was defeating it and there's a treatment out there called Nate for any
[01:57:54.120 --> 01:57:58.560]  of your listeners that want to get a treatment it actually has helped me out
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:58:03.680]  tremendously and well they admit that there's frequency pollution out there
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:06.920]  that's affecting humans and all the cancer studies but not just the cell
[01:58:06.920 --> 01:58:10.880]  phone itself that's a microwave relay system the cell towers that's what's
[01:58:10.880 --> 01:58:14.760]  really powerful right well I could tell if somebody had a mobile phone in their
[01:58:14.760 --> 01:58:20.360]  pocket I'll stand in next to me so but I thought for a good search term for your
[01:58:20.360 --> 01:58:23.680]  listeners if you hadn't done it yet I don't think you have but conspiracy of
[01:58:23.680 --> 01:58:28.920]  silence I think that would be a huge wrench in the whole program isn't that
[01:58:28.920 --> 01:58:33.200]  the documentary about pedophiles correct and I'm gonna know we were the first
[01:58:33.200 --> 01:58:37.720]  people to ever put that on the internet about 12 years ago stay there we'll come

[01:58:51.560 --> 01:58:55.320]  five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number
[01:58:55.320 --> 01:58:59.080]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:58:59.080 --> 01:59:03.600]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[01:59:03.600 --> 01:59:07.800]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:12.440]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:16.440]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[01:59:16.440 --> 01:59:20.560]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:24.520]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[01:59:24.520 --> 01:59:28.680]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[01:59:28.680 --> 01:59:32.480]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:35.960]  power generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors

[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:37.440]  Watson has written a new article about pre-crime technology to be used in
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:43.680]  Washington and info wars dot net went down drudge about eight years ago tried
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:48.480]  to link to info wars in prison planted a few times but we couldn't handle his
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:55.520]  traffic info wars dot net is a auxiliary backup attack frigate in the info war

[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:31.520]  was going to get into this later in the show but had no idea that drudge had
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:36.520]  just linked to it pre-crime technology to be used in Washington DC in fact let's

[02:03:57.240 --> 02:04:01.000]  it never aired on BBC all the clear evidence of government pedophile
[02:04:01.000 --> 02:04:04.600]  rings and then we did air it in parts on access and I got picked up and put on

[02:10:56.080 --> 02:11:01.240]  was one 24-hour period when every time we tried to go to your site we get we get
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:05.160]  a sense to a mirror site that looked like yours but then would give us a virus
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:09.520]  do you remember when that happened we've had all sorts of tricks what that must
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:14.120]  have been was a virus on your computer it's called scumware basically that
[02:11:14.120 --> 02:11:18.640]  takes over your computer when you put something in and then shows you tailored
[02:11:18.640 --> 02:11:23.400]  ads that look like the website so that wasn't actually my site we've had that
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:28.160]  happen it was our bar well who knows but all I can tell you is somebody really
[02:11:28.160 --> 02:11:33.520]  had it in for info wars that day well you know this is just that drudge link to
[02:11:33.520 --> 02:11:38.120]  one of our backup auxiliaries that we're gonna move to a beefier server it's
[02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:41.400]  actually on the prison planet TV server that's that's a bunch of servers
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:46.080]  together so in a prison planet TV's having problems so as info wars.net
[02:11:46.080 --> 02:11:50.560]  we're gonna we just purchased a bunch of other big servers in our own service
[02:11:50.560 --> 02:11:54.640]  farm a server farm here in Austin we're building that right now that was a
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:58.560]  capital improvement of 55,000 a lot of money for us thanks to listener support
[02:11:58.560 --> 02:12:01.880]  so we're not just spread out all over the world but also have this as backups
[02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:05.760]  but for now this key drudge report link is dead in the doornail but we'll
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:09.080]  survive it we're gonna make pre-dash crime the number one search today our
[02:12:09.080 --> 02:12:12.560]  wonderful listeners have never failed but Catherine great to have you here with
[02:12:12.560 --> 02:12:16.440]  us break down you've got the floor for the rest of the segment I mean I'm not
[02:12:16.440 --> 02:12:19.160]  gonna interrupt you break down what's happening in the economy everything you
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:24.360]  predicted where this is going housing starts and existing home sales the
[02:12:24.360 --> 02:12:29.160]  lowest the headline says in 15 years but the article actually says since the
[02:12:29.160 --> 02:12:35.280]  1960s 1968 so and now the media is saying yeah it's not really a double
[02:12:35.280 --> 02:12:40.640]  depression it could be a depression well it's we're not we're not going through
[02:12:40.640 --> 02:12:45.800]  depression or recession we're going through re-engineering in governance of
[02:12:45.800 --> 02:12:50.000]  resources on planet Earth is in the process of being re-engineered I call
[02:12:50.000 --> 02:12:55.160]  it a financial coup d'etat and and what we're watching is an economy that's
[02:12:55.160 --> 02:12:59.720]  very managed it's a political economy and so the different market frameworks
[02:12:59.720 --> 02:13:04.600]  you hear people talk about the financial area in some respects aren't
[02:13:04.600 --> 02:13:08.640]  appropriate out and one of the things I want to make very clear about the current
[02:13:08.640 --> 02:13:13.800]  economy if you said to me you know something Catherine you're a portfolio
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:18.120]  strategist just re-optimized the economy to create as much wealth as possible
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:22.240]  what I would tell you is the wealth that we could create whether it's human
[02:13:22.240 --> 02:13:28.120]  capital or environmental capital or financial capital is is hundreds of
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:34.120]  multiples greater than what we have now in other words our economy is totally
[02:13:34.120 --> 02:13:39.040]  constrained by the desire of the people at the top to want to have total control
[02:13:39.040 --> 02:13:45.960]  and the more you institute total control the less healthy the economy is and so
[02:13:45.960 --> 02:13:50.920]  we don't have an economic problem at all because the potential for wealth and
[02:13:50.920 --> 02:13:56.680]  abundance is unbelievable what we have is a political problem and that
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:00.800]  translates into cultural problems so they want to control it and hog it and
[02:14:00.800 --> 02:14:03.880]  be able to dominate a said one interrupt but I can't help it you're so smart
[02:14:03.880 --> 02:14:07.400]  you're absolutely right and they know that they know when they raise taxes it
[02:14:07.400 --> 02:14:10.720]  drives down the economy they admit it they want control they want to destroy
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:17.680]  it to consolidate it as you've said right and and you think for 500 years the
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:22.400]  the you know sort of the Western world has functioned on what I call the
[02:14:22.400 --> 02:14:27.760]  central banking warfare model that's our paradigm so the central banks print
[02:14:27.760 --> 02:14:32.560]  money and then the military makes sure they take it and we get cheap access to
[02:14:32.560 --> 02:14:36.880]  natural resources and the reality is Alex that you and I have been the
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:41.560]  beneficiary of that most people in America have been the beneficiary of
[02:14:41.560 --> 02:14:45.800]  this model you know how did we get the land we're standing on right now well
[02:14:45.800 --> 02:14:50.640]  we killed all the people who were here and let's not be naive about how we we
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:57.040]  got what we got so the central banking warfare model has has continued and the
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:02.400]  reality is it's not going to work anymore it has to change and and you have
[02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:07.320]  a group of the leadership groups who are saying okay well we have a plan to
[02:15:07.320 --> 02:15:12.600]  change it because it's no longer going to work and our plan you know you and I
[02:15:12.600 --> 02:15:16.920]  refer to it as the new world order but it's centralizes things it gives much
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:21.760]  more totalitarian control and it depopulates because let's face it if
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:25.560]  we're going to live this way you know with six billion people going to nine
[02:15:25.560 --> 02:15:28.920]  billion there's going to be there will environmental issues unless you
[02:15:28.920 --> 02:15:34.080]  unsuppressed technology which threatens control and so they've got a plan and the
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:39.320]  reality Alex is that we need a different plan and what needs to happen is
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:44.160]  people globally need to come together and start talking about okay let's come
[02:15:44.160 --> 02:15:47.120]  up with an alternative plan that addresses all the issues because one
[02:15:47.120 --> 02:15:51.320]  thing I will say in defense of the new world orders plan they they're
[02:15:51.320 --> 02:15:54.920]  addressing all the issues now I don't like the way they're doing it and I
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:15:59.000]  don't think it's going to work I mean the reason I ended up you know on a
[02:15:59.000 --> 02:16:03.720]  radio show with you and having that opportunity as opposed to sitting on
[02:16:03.720 --> 02:16:06.840]  Wall Street is I don't think their plans go work I don't want to be part of it
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:12.760]  it's disgusting I don't want total control well that's a moral position too
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:17.720]  and money it and everything doing the right thing is so fulfilling and being
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:22.520]  part of the human community and and standing up against tyranny as soon as
[02:16:22.520 --> 02:16:28.160]  you do that you have a lot more energy you feel good about yourself I mean so
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:32.640]  many people I talk to who are depressed or unhappy the media makes them feel
[02:16:32.640 --> 02:16:36.480]  inadequate all of this Madison Avenue culture is to make you think you're
[02:16:36.480 --> 02:16:41.000]  ugly and stupid we are beautiful wonderful creatures who can appreciate
[02:16:41.000 --> 02:16:46.280]  beauty you know for me Catherine just the fact that our eyes and our mind can
[02:16:46.280 --> 02:16:51.200]  appreciate a beautiful mountain vista or a sunrise or a bouquet of flowers or a
[02:16:51.200 --> 02:16:56.240]  beautiful woman or if you're a woman a handsome man the fact that I can appreciate
[02:16:56.240 --> 02:17:00.920]  the innocence and and and and enlightenment of my innocent children and
[02:17:00.920 --> 02:17:04.800]  literally seek God through them it's like that line in the road when he's
[02:17:04.800 --> 02:17:12.760]  talking to Robert to to Robert DeVall and you know the guy saying my son is
[02:17:12.760 --> 02:17:16.920]  like a god and and and he says to him yes but in this dangerous world you know
[02:17:16.920 --> 02:17:19.960]  that's a dangerous thing I mean I'm paraphrasing I'm not saying my children
[02:17:19.960 --> 02:17:26.320]  are gods I'm saying through that I can see what really matters but let's go
[02:17:26.320 --> 02:17:30.840]  back to the scripture you know Jesus said what I can do you can do and that's
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:37.000]  true in that sense we all have that capacity to be of a god why shouldn't
[02:17:37.000 --> 02:17:41.560]  we I mean why shouldn't we go to the very highest and excellent that we can be
[02:17:41.560 --> 02:17:48.280]  and that the challenge is that you know that there are a group of people who
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:52.440]  feel that that would be you know that would make us very difficult difficult
[02:17:52.440 --> 02:17:55.680]  to control now in your defense let me just go back because I think it's
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:59.920]  important to look at this from what I call Mr. Global's point of view Mr.
[02:17:59.920 --> 02:18:04.080]  Global is sort of my cartoon character for the people running things and that is
[02:18:04.080 --> 02:18:10.160]  you know in their experience Alex the central banking warfare model and and
[02:18:10.160 --> 02:18:15.240]  top-down control and force has always worked in other words what if you and
[02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:18.360]  let me go back to the scripture just because there's stories people understand
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:22.320]  if you look at the story of the crucifixion remember the Romans knew it
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:26.240]  was very bad karma to kill Jesus they didn't want to do it you know Pontius
[02:18:26.240 --> 02:18:30.280]  Paolo was trying to figure out how to get out of it and so he invited the crowd
[02:18:30.280 --> 02:18:35.400]  to choose who they wanted crucified Jesus or the criminal and the crowd chose
[02:18:35.400 --> 02:18:41.400]  Jesus so the crowd got manipulated into into you know basically supporting the
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:46.040]  the criminal and killing the good guy and that's been the leadership's
[02:18:46.040 --> 02:18:50.040]  experience that that being honest and hard-working and doing the right thing
[02:18:50.040 --> 02:18:56.720]  and financial responsibility doesn't pay and I'll tell you a very funny story I
[02:18:56.720 --> 02:19:02.520]  was in London in 2001 giving a paper and I described this in my article
[02:19:02.520 --> 02:19:06.280]  financial coup d'etat you just do a search from under my name for financial
[02:19:06.280 --> 02:19:10.200]  coup d'etat you pick it up and I was asked to give a paper which was called
[02:19:10.200 --> 02:19:13.640]  the myth of the rule of law about the corruption in America but from a
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:18.520]  investors point of view and explaining sort of the economics of the government
[02:19:18.520 --> 02:19:21.480]  budget and how the government money was really being used to sort of corrupt
[02:19:21.480 --> 02:19:26.280]  the whole place and this was a huge transfer to the insiders that was not
[02:19:26.280 --> 02:19:32.000]  economic and anyway so there was a guy in the audience who was clearly sent
[02:19:32.000 --> 02:19:36.920]  over you know the boys in America had sent him over to like you know watch me
[02:19:36.920 --> 02:19:41.240]  and destroy my credibility that's the music yeah when come back finish the
[02:19:41.240 --> 02:19:43.920]  story I didn't want to interrupt you stay there Catherine Austin Fitz will give

[02:24:23.960 --> 02:24:30.320]  blog to so salari.com very simple very simple okay you got cut off during your
[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:34.960]  story recap it and continue okay so I'm in London giving this present a
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:37.840]  presentation of a paper called the myth of the rule of law and the boys have
[02:24:37.840 --> 02:24:42.960]  clearly sent over this guy you know who somehow is going to question my credibility
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:47.360]  I finished my presentation it was very you know it's very well documented very
[02:24:47.360 --> 02:24:51.360]  calm very professional very much from the investment point of view and this guy
[02:24:51.360 --> 02:24:54.320]  you can see as I'm giving the paper he's getting more and more frustrated more
[02:24:54.320 --> 02:24:58.000]  and more frustrated more and more frustrated because he can't you know
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:02.440]  it's it's very impeccable and so we finished and he just he burst out he
[02:25:02.440 --> 02:25:06.560]  doesn't even raise his hand as question he said you don't understand it's you
[02:25:06.560 --> 02:25:10.920]  can't trust the people to behave in a responsible way and then I looked at him
[02:25:10.920 --> 02:25:16.120]  I said so you mean you kill all the people who will take responsibility and he
[02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:20.320]  just he was like a man looking in the mirror he froze freaked and stood up and
[02:25:20.320 --> 02:25:25.120]  just left I guess you just flew back to the United States but but there you know
[02:25:25.120 --> 02:25:30.120]  the challenge you have is that the people at the top the leadership assume
[02:25:30.120 --> 02:25:32.920]  that the people will not do the responsible thing and you've got a
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:38.600]  negative cycle and the question for us is you know one week we need to get as
[02:25:38.600 --> 02:25:43.000]  far away from the people as possible we need to withdraw our support because if
[02:25:43.000 --> 02:25:47.440]  you look at households in this country Alex and our money we're the one who
[02:25:47.440 --> 02:25:51.680]  are financing them we're subpoena we're turning on their TV we're watching their
[02:25:51.680 --> 02:25:56.000]  media we're buying their newspapers we're putting our money into Wall Street
[02:25:56.000 --> 02:26:00.280]  we're putting our money in the big banks we're financing this and we have the
[02:26:00.280 --> 02:26:04.000]  power to simply withdraw very passive aggressive you don't have to go
[02:26:04.000 --> 02:26:07.600]  confront him you don't have to you know get it with your gas in a march all you
[02:26:07.600 --> 02:26:12.200]  have to do is say you know something I'm taking my mind and my money and I'm
[02:26:12.200 --> 02:26:16.560]  leaving well here's a microcosm here's a microcosm briefly I don't go
[02:26:16.560 --> 02:26:22.120]  shopping a lot but this Saturday with my wife and children I went to Target to buy
[02:26:22.120 --> 02:26:28.000]  cookingware because our pots and pans were getting kind of worn out and we
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.200]  went over to the Tupperware area the plastic Tupperware and I'd say over 80
[02:26:33.200 --> 02:26:39.600]  percent was suddenly glass and it was all you know the heat resistant
[02:26:39.600 --> 02:26:46.680]  shatterproof or shatter resistant brands has almost completely displaced and I
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:51.040]  was watching when my wife was shopping in that area I was watching women who do
[02:26:51.040 --> 02:26:56.720]  80 plus percent of the purchases study show going up and buying the glass and I
[02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:01.040]  asked the lady I said why are you doing that and she said well Alex I like your
[02:27:01.040 --> 02:27:07.400]  show it buys phenol a so and every police officer's I see an Austin on the
[02:27:07.400 --> 02:27:11.520]  street or the road pulls over and says they're a fan now I mean we and this is
[02:27:11.520 --> 02:27:17.000]  just my microcosm I mean we've reached critical mass so just like people now
[02:27:17.000 --> 02:27:21.240]  know by spinole is bad they're changing things with their purchases and that's
[02:27:21.240 --> 02:27:25.960]  what you're saying is we need to do that with everything everything and let me
[02:27:25.960 --> 02:27:30.960]  tell you something I've seen stories get on corporate media because they're
[02:27:30.960 --> 02:27:34.480]  afraid that you're pulling market share from them you know and they can't
[02:27:34.480 --> 02:27:38.240]  afford to ignore it any money because you're pulling too much traffic well
[02:27:38.240 --> 02:27:43.280]  yahoo keep it up and that's why you know if more and more cash is coming into
[02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:48.080]  your site you can provide more and more coverage people buying DVDs buying

[02:28:18.580 --> 02:28:22.760]  important but it's right now it's a strategic inflection point and that's
[02:28:22.760 --> 02:28:30.000]  food food if there is one thing where a person needs to to come up with and say
[02:28:30.000 --> 02:28:33.520]  I don't want to be dependent on the corporate systems I don't want to be
[02:28:33.520 --> 02:28:38.320]  dependent on industrial agriculture I'm going to figure out a way to build and
[02:28:38.320 --> 02:28:42.680]  operate you know my own food system I'm going to connect with the local farmers
[02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:46.080]  I'm going to connect with the farmers markets I'm going to learn about what
[02:28:46.080 --> 02:28:50.560]  food I need to be eating to be healthy because if you feel your children you

[02:29:01.960 --> 02:29:07.840]  a war we see all across the country people enforcing against raw milk
[02:29:07.840 --> 02:29:13.000]  anything that has animal proteins which is the source of incredible physical
[02:29:13.000 --> 02:29:18.600]  strength and intellectual energy we're watching come down we see we see people
[02:29:18.600 --> 02:29:22.080]  enforcing all over the country on raw milk I don't know what he saw several
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:27.000]  weeks ago with with the police coming in with guns drawn to arrest a food club in

[02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:47.840]  reason to get out of their system but also we've got to become self-sufficient

[02:31:03.440 --> 02:31:07.800]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double

[02:31:19.880 --> 02:31:24.120]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:31:24.120 --> 02:31:28.280]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[02:31:28.280 --> 02:31:32.600]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[02:31:32.600 --> 02:31:35.880]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages

[02:34:03.560 --> 02:34:07.720]  link to this scary article about computers predict what crime will be
[02:34:07.720 --> 02:34:12.280]  committed where and by who and when by surveilling your cell phone your power
[02:34:12.280 --> 02:34:16.280]  bill your internet surfing your bank accounts the government's dumping this
[02:34:16.280 --> 02:34:20.200]  all into giant databases and if we talk about food I want Catherine Austin Fitz
[02:34:20.200 --> 02:34:24.120]  to talk about this this surveillance grid and Google in its own words this is in
[02:34:24.120 --> 02:34:28.680]  the article has purchased a defense department connected company and they
[02:34:28.680 --> 02:34:33.080]  were funded by of course in Q-tell and admitted CIA consortium Google itself
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:36.840]  was to quote predict the future I've been telling you this for years this is
[02:34:36.840 --> 02:34:41.240]  what this is all about they can already over 93% accuracy just off of
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:46.120]  following your cell phone beacon with the GPS triangulation after a few months
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:49.480]  of watching where you go and what you do they know patterns of what you're gonna
[02:34:49.480 --> 02:34:54.320]  do to 93% accuracy this is what what they admit by tracking where you go and
[02:34:54.320 --> 02:34:58.640]  what you do and they get an entire psychological image of you and they're
[02:34:58.640 --> 02:35:01.880]  violating your fourth amendment but more importantly they could interject fake
[02:35:01.880 --> 02:35:06.160]  data into this and claim you're a criminal when you're not it's just like
[02:35:06.160 --> 02:35:10.360]  the behavioral face scanners now in the airports they're testing at what six
[02:35:10.360 --> 02:35:14.880]  airports that supposedly say your face looked criminal or major airlines saying
[02:35:14.880 --> 02:35:19.120]  the back seat will film and record everything you're saying and computers
[02:35:19.120 --> 02:35:23.680]  will take the audio of what you're saying if you yell at your kids CPS will be
[02:35:23.680 --> 02:35:26.560]  waiting to take them when you land I mean this is what they're admitting
[02:35:26.560 --> 02:35:30.840]  everyone will wear taser bracelets homeland securities looking at that so
[02:35:30.840 --> 02:35:35.440]  you're all criminals but but Catherine continuing with food and other issues
[02:35:35.440 --> 02:35:39.880]  then we'll get into pre-crime okay so we were watching enforcement against
[02:35:39.880 --> 02:35:44.400]  raw milk around the country in ways that are really frightening but now with
[02:35:44.400 --> 02:35:49.440]  these with these egg recalls we're starting to see article saying we need to
[02:35:49.440 --> 02:35:55.080]  pasteurize the eggs okay so what is after milk what is one of the great
[02:35:55.080 --> 02:36:00.720]  sources of animal protein to people it's eggs well Alex I can't imagine
[02:36:00.720 --> 02:36:04.760]  anything more insane than putting extra process where you destroy all the
[02:36:04.760 --> 02:36:10.640]  vitality nutritional life for them I mean so the patronization of eggs is now
[02:36:10.640 --> 02:36:15.560]  coming and they'd already been promoting that before this happened and
[02:36:15.560 --> 02:36:19.880]  they're talking about not letting family farms have their own eggs so it's a new
[02:36:19.880 --> 02:36:24.560]  level they want to radiate them they want to cook them milk is very healthy
[02:36:24.560 --> 02:36:28.760]  the study show until they boil it and pasteurize it it turns into basically
[02:36:28.760 --> 02:36:34.160]  sludge that is deadly to the heart so this is the weaponization of the food
[02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:39.880]  right and and well it's the it's the you know how did we kill the Indians we
[02:36:39.880 --> 02:36:44.120]  killed their food supply if you want to kill a people in a subtle way you kill
[02:36:44.120 --> 02:36:47.760]  their food first and and then you control it and and have the remaining
[02:36:47.760 --> 02:36:52.280]  population be totally dependent so so the first thing people can do to help
[02:36:52.280 --> 02:36:57.680]  themselves is each person in their own life their own household start to build
[02:36:57.680 --> 02:37:03.200]  food freedom food independence it is crazy that we're all buying buying
[02:37:03.200 --> 02:37:08.160]  lottery tickets what when our small farmers go without capital so you know
[02:37:08.160 --> 02:37:13.600]  start if you retire there's dirt you know start investing in building that
[02:37:13.600 --> 02:37:17.680]  local food and when you see people selling peaches pull over and buy some
[02:37:17.680 --> 02:37:22.360]  or watermelons go to the farmers markets or move out to the edge of town
[02:37:22.360 --> 02:37:25.400]  Austin's actually passed a law where you can have chickens a lot of people are
[02:37:25.400 --> 02:37:29.840]  doing it have a few chickens and that way everybody's got chickens they can't
[02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:34.900]  stop us from getting our own eggs right and you know you have edible
[02:37:34.900 --> 02:37:40.040]  communities dot com is starting local food magazines in every area Austin has
[02:37:40.040 --> 02:37:43.880]  a wonderful one you know that's somebody you might consider having on the show
[02:37:43.880 --> 02:37:48.400]  and and fine you know they're these huge sort of networks growing up and
[02:37:48.400 --> 02:37:52.000]  they're fun they're great it's a way to meet great people to have a lot for you
[02:37:52.000 --> 02:37:56.320]  know food brings out the best in this and fresh food really brings out the best
[02:37:56.320 --> 02:38:01.800]  in a cell so find the people who are who are building that their food clubs
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:05.720]  there's something called community supported agriculture's DSA their
[02:38:05.720 --> 02:38:09.680]  community garden there's just an endless array of things and each one of us
[02:38:09.680 --> 02:38:14.320]  Alex has to do the thing which is you know time convenient you want to you
[02:38:14.320 --> 02:38:18.520]  want to do this in a way which is convenient and fun for you but but get
[02:38:18.520 --> 02:38:22.920]  out of the big grocery stores get out of corporate the corporate food is not
[02:38:22.920 --> 02:38:28.120]  safe that's what you know it's so hard for most people to fathom how dangerous
[02:38:28.120 --> 02:38:34.160]  the poisons have become in the food let me add something to this through my
[02:38:34.160 --> 02:38:38.920]  son and some of his homeschooling friends I've met people that live out in
[02:38:38.920 --> 02:38:42.280]  Wemberley and dripping Springs and I've even thought about trying to move out
[02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:46.160]  there but the commute would be over an hour from for me to get to my studio
[02:38:46.160 --> 02:38:50.280]  from Wemberley and dripping Springs doesn't seem to be far enough out but
[02:38:50.280 --> 02:38:55.920]  when I've met these parents their lawyers their doctors their scientist and
[02:38:55.920 --> 02:39:01.720]  many of them know who I am but before they ever heard my show they all know
[02:39:01.720 --> 02:39:05.840]  everything about the New World Order I was out there a few months ago at a
[02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:10.240]  camp out for a birthday party I was talking to medical doctors they knew
[02:39:10.240 --> 02:39:14.760]  15 years ago about the plan to have vaccines that go in and reprogram the
[02:39:14.760 --> 02:39:18.560]  brain to make you a submissive zombie now it's being advertised in the news is
[02:39:18.560 --> 02:39:24.080]  great they knew all about the takeover of food they created their own community
[02:39:24.080 --> 02:39:29.280]  food co-ops with incredible quality was the best food I ever ate and they're
[02:39:29.280 --> 02:39:33.240]  obsessed with it and they've now got this whole community of awake people so
[02:39:33.240 --> 02:39:37.880]  if you find the people in your area that are involved in these food co-ops and
[02:39:37.880 --> 02:39:41.840]  things you're going to find the people that know what's going on I mean they
[02:39:41.840 --> 02:39:46.360]  I mean it was amazing is what I'm saying and now I'm finding that it's
[02:39:46.360 --> 02:39:52.360]  spreading all over it the globalists are scared right and look at look at where
[02:39:52.360 --> 02:39:57.040]  we've had but let's refer to our team is the pro decentralization team we're the
[02:39:57.040 --> 02:40:02.120]  people who want you know because the New World Order has a plan to modify the
[02:40:02.120 --> 02:40:06.840]  central banking warfare we need our own plan and and so we've got to reinvent
[02:40:06.840 --> 02:40:10.760]  how we do things and it all starts with food and what you'll discover if you
[02:40:10.760 --> 02:40:16.680]  look at where our team has successes we were successful in a homeschool you know
[02:40:16.680 --> 02:40:20.720]  they tried to stop homeschooling and we said oh no and look at at homeschools
[02:40:20.720 --> 02:40:26.200]  growing gangbusters swine flu they tried to push the swine flu Alex you were
[02:40:26.200 --> 02:40:29.880]  enormous in helping to stop that but there are too many people who are
[02:40:29.880 --> 02:40:34.760]  smart about out here now and they couldn't get it done now you know you saw
[02:40:34.760 --> 02:40:41.440]  Dr. Markola's new interview he you've got it up on your website you know so
[02:40:41.440 --> 02:40:44.640]  now they're trying to integrate it with a normal flu shot to get it done this
[02:40:44.640 --> 02:40:48.720]  year and that's what's incredible is the British Medical Journal the EU Medical
[02:40:48.720 --> 02:40:51.740]  Commission we've had the head of the journal the editor and the head of the
[02:40:51.740 --> 02:40:56.280]  EU Commission on they conclusively found pre-meditated lie the shots give a ten
[02:40:56.280 --> 02:41:01.280]  fold increase in convulsions massive increases in Guion beret it was a total
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:06.760]  hoax and there was record low of people taking regular seasonal and the H1N1
[02:41:06.760 --> 02:41:11.720]  so we had a record low in the last 20 plus years this was admitted flu season
[02:41:11.720 --> 02:41:16.160]  because people didn't take the flu shots because all the evidence shows it's
[02:41:16.160 --> 02:41:20.800]  causing most of the flu just like the UN's been caught in Asia Africa and
[02:41:20.800 --> 02:41:24.920]  Latin America in the last five years giving people weaponized polio shots
[02:41:24.920 --> 02:41:30.160]  that actually are killing and maiming them and so now they're back again saying
[02:41:30.160 --> 02:41:36.160]  you got to take the flu shot of your dad but as you said record low of people
[02:41:36.160 --> 02:41:42.160]  buying the propaganda so what we're watching in the food area is people
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:46.360]  drawing the line in the stand and saying no I will not eat genetically modified
[02:41:46.360 --> 02:41:50.520]  food it's not safe and I will do whatever I have to do to get the right
[02:41:50.520 --> 02:41:56.160]  food for my kids because you know this is you know this is not food food is
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:42:01.120]  medicine it's not just food and when you when you bought genetically modified
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:06.040]  food is not food it's poison so we have a choice we can eat poison or we can eat
[02:42:06.040 --> 02:42:10.280]  medicine and and that's the choice and too many people are drawing a line in
[02:42:10.280 --> 02:42:14.280]  the stand so another reason to find the food people is those are the people who
[02:42:14.280 --> 02:42:17.720]  understand that death is not the worst thing that can happen and they're the
[02:42:17.720 --> 02:42:20.880]  ones who are going to draw a line in the stand and if you look at all I have a
[02:42:20.880 --> 02:42:25.360]  I have a number of friends Alex who are top consultants in the whole food
[02:42:25.360 --> 02:42:30.640]  industry if you look at the at the market research reports on what people
[02:42:30.640 --> 02:42:36.000]  want in terms of fresh local or organic food it's off the charts I mean it's
[02:42:36.000 --> 02:42:40.880]  growing like gang it's growing and the markets there so more people need to
[02:42:40.880 --> 02:42:46.160]  invest in developing the clean real food industry and advertising it and
[02:42:46.160 --> 02:42:50.520]  deploying it because we can see the controllers worldwide coming in with a
[02:42:50.520 --> 02:42:55.560]  new flotilla of food suppression tyranny they are trying to head us off at the
[02:42:55.560 --> 02:43:00.640]  pass right and that's why not surprisingly what do we just get we're
[02:43:00.640 --> 02:43:05.520]  getting a new food safety bill and you know in Washington I used to always say
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:09.080]  when I was assistant secretary of housing whatever the name is it's the
[02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:15.480]  opposite so what is the CIA been caught doing hundreds of times releasing
[02:43:15.480 --> 02:43:21.880]  microbes funguses to kill third-world crops releasing grasshoppers by the
[02:43:21.880 --> 02:43:26.280]  millions they are masters at this and it's clear evidence they've been running
[02:43:26.280 --> 02:43:30.960]  false flags in many cases against food supplies and it's always big agra that
[02:43:30.960 --> 02:43:35.280]  does it but then they go after the little guy as the supposed solution
[02:43:35.280 --> 02:43:40.680]  right but they can't you know so food safety is basically a way to exercise
[02:43:40.680 --> 02:43:45.800]  even more you know control and concentration of food and at the same
[02:43:45.800 --> 02:43:49.240]  time that the food safety bill is being negotiated in the Senate what are we
[02:43:49.240 --> 02:43:54.440]  seeing in the market we're seeing DHP tender forty three nine billion dollars
[02:43:54.440 --> 02:44:00.680]  for potash what what that's all about is is clearly they understand behind the
[02:44:00.680 --> 02:44:07.840]  scenes that that food prices are headed up and and that this is the premier
[02:44:07.840 --> 02:44:13.240]  control point even more than oil and gas now it's food and so just as they
[02:44:13.240 --> 02:44:16.840]  understand it and they're making their moves we need to understand it I want
[02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:22.400]  everybody listening to this that doesn't say okay let's assume food prices for the
[02:44:22.400 --> 02:44:26.520]  next three years are going up you know five to fifteen percent a year for the
[02:44:26.520 --> 02:44:30.360]  next three years how am I going to jump the curve on that and get higher
[02:44:30.360 --> 02:44:35.120]  quality food at lower cost and that requires Alex organization and there
[02:44:35.120 --> 02:44:40.600]  absolutely ways to do it but we need to think starting very creatively about
[02:44:40.600 --> 02:44:46.560]  okay you know do I join this DSA do I organize with my neighbors and do a food
[02:44:46.560 --> 02:44:50.440]  club do we go down and buy wholesale at the terminal market how do we do it and
[02:44:50.440 --> 02:44:54.560]  by the way that's normal human interaction it's fun to be involved in
[02:44:54.560 --> 02:44:59.680]  the selling of good food the growing of it this is real humanity out there in the
[02:44:59.680 --> 02:45:03.440]  mud and the dirt and the grass you know with with goats and chickens running
[02:45:03.440 --> 02:45:08.160]  around not watching glowing TV screens and gobbling Prozac but expanding on
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:14.000]  that expanding briefly my father about a year ago said I'm suddenly seeing
[02:45:14.000 --> 02:45:18.720]  water well drillers all over Austin I didn't know you could drill a well in
[02:45:18.720 --> 02:45:21.480]  Austin we found out there's certain zones they don't let you in the name of
[02:45:21.480 --> 02:45:25.400]  water quality but there are many areas in Austin and Travis County you can and
[02:45:25.400 --> 02:45:30.160]  then I saw a newscast about thousands of wells being drilled and the and I called
[02:45:30.160 --> 02:45:33.640]  up one of the biggest companies in the newscast and they said oh hi Alex yeah we
[02:45:33.640 --> 02:45:38.320]  know who you are they said a lot of people that are calling us and get out in
[02:45:38.320 --> 02:45:42.360]  fact I meant to have them on I never told the producers to get them on that
[02:45:42.360 --> 02:45:45.760]  they're they're afraid the government's going to stop them from being able to
[02:45:45.760 --> 02:45:49.440]  have a well they didn't even know they could have a well so suddenly middle
[02:45:49.440 --> 02:45:54.280]  class and wealthy people the the well drilling rigs are just all over town
[02:45:54.280 --> 02:45:58.160]  they're coming in from all over Texas to drill because the people instinctively
[02:45:58.160 --> 02:46:02.120]  know that the globalists are coming in buying up water supplies and they've
[02:46:02.120 --> 02:46:06.480]  got to get wells grandfathered so we're really seeing people quietly getting
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:12.400]  ready well I you know it's just I'm an investment advisor and I'm constantly
[02:46:12.400 --> 02:46:17.840]  saying to people you know if you if you why are you complaining that your yields
[02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:22.000]  are dropping on your investments and your water bill is going up this is really
[02:46:22.000 --> 02:46:26.840]  simple the water that you're buying is not safe get your money you know stop
[02:46:26.840 --> 02:46:30.680]  financing the water companies in the stock market who then provide you with
[02:46:30.680 --> 02:46:35.160]  unsafe water why don't you just go build your own well and that's why they're
[02:46:35.160 --> 02:46:40.800]  moving to block rainwater collection right absolutely because the 20 years
[02:46:40.800 --> 02:46:45.960]  from now water will be considered far more precious than oil and gas water
[02:46:45.960 --> 02:46:53.920]  you know water is water in sunlight is the source and oxygen and so you know
[02:46:53.920 --> 02:46:58.920]  when I Alex I live out in the country I had my own well I tested the water
[02:46:58.920 --> 02:47:05.320]  Lehman's wonderful store that supplies the Amish has a great water test and my
[02:47:05.320 --> 02:47:10.600]  water tested perfectly and I still got a whole house water filter because I was
[02:47:10.600 --> 02:47:17.080]  still afraid of what chemtrails might do to the water table you know so there's
[02:47:17.080 --> 02:47:21.640]  nothing more important than having excellent water and so so this is an
[02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:25.800]  area where everybody listening to the show if you if your takeaway is I'm
[02:47:25.800 --> 02:47:30.800]  going to think about how to create healthy redundant sources of food and
[02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:34.760]  water and get withdraw from the system because that's going to be one of the
[02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:39.560]  major major control points and the the other thing to say because if you look
[02:47:39.560 --> 02:47:42.920]  at what's going to happen with the economy what's happening now it's going
[02:47:42.920 --> 02:47:47.160]  to happen next year I want everybody to sit down and say I need to get radical
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:55.320]  about my time how can I cut out of my life every connection to the big system
[02:47:55.320 --> 02:47:59.760]  the big government the big corporations how can I reduce my interaction in my
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:03.120]  dependency in a way that saves me time because you're going to need that time
[02:48:03.120 --> 02:48:07.360]  to build these new networks and these connections you're going to need time to
[02:48:07.360 --> 02:48:14.840]  really rethink how you do food so you know turn off corporate news get radical
[02:48:14.840 --> 02:48:19.800]  if you're doing things because you think it's so you know it looks right you need
[02:48:19.800 --> 02:48:25.160]  to stop that you need every minute of your time to build energy for you and
[02:48:25.160 --> 02:48:29.800]  your family because next year we're going to have lots of different systems
[02:48:29.800 --> 02:48:34.240]  going through unbelievable change and it's going to put unbelievable pressure
[02:48:34.240 --> 02:48:38.840]  on your time well more people in systems in crisis well I want to get in the
[02:48:38.840 --> 02:48:43.080]  final segment or and as we going to break talk about the changes from your
[02:48:43.080 --> 02:48:46.120]  financial expertise that we're going into and how serious it's going to get but
[02:48:46.120 --> 02:48:49.760]  seven million people major university studies have shown we've we've covered
[02:48:49.760 --> 02:48:54.000]  them here starved in the ten years of the depression it's estimated they would
[02:48:54.000 --> 02:48:59.680]  get compromised immune systems from malnutrition and dying there were a lot
[02:48:59.680 --> 02:49:05.120]  of serious problems that was with 90% of people being rural 10% being urban now
[02:49:05.120 --> 02:49:10.240]  we're right at 90% urban 10% rural of that 10% they estimate only about half
[02:49:10.240 --> 02:49:14.960]  or self-sufficient we have got to get self-sufficient now and real wealth is
[02:49:14.960 --> 02:49:19.000]  community it's knowing your neighbors it's being partially self-sufficient at
[02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:23.920]  least letting them be partially self-sufficient and having packs to
[02:49:23.920 --> 02:49:27.200]  to help each other during collapse do you agree
[02:49:27.200 --> 02:49:32.720]  oh absolutely start being as useful as you can to your neighbors and the people in
[02:49:32.720 --> 02:49:36.840]  your network that's how you by being useful with everybody else that's how
[02:49:36.840 --> 02:49:41.080]  we find the opportunities to build because what we're really looking to do
[02:49:41.080 --> 02:49:46.920]  is build resiliency and and by by really being able to help each other and do it
[02:49:46.920 --> 02:49:52.000]  without going through the big system well we've got to do it now stop buying
[02:49:52.000 --> 02:49:57.160]  the Walmart junk start investing and my dad looked into drilling a well on his
[02:49:57.160 --> 02:50:01.920]  little piece of property he's got three acres and in town and it's not zoned
[02:50:01.920 --> 02:50:05.960]  he's not allowed to but I mean I'm to the point of I wish there were drilling
[02:50:05.960 --> 02:50:09.480]  companies it's time to start rebelling you know we're allowed to have our own
[02:50:09.480 --> 02:50:14.200]  water you know we're allowed did you see last year we're a major city in
[02:50:14.200 --> 02:50:19.280]  Oklahoma Tucson said people may grow marijuana in their gardens we want to
[02:50:19.280 --> 02:50:24.400]  law to have inspections of gardens to make sure backyard gardens aren't growing
[02:50:24.400 --> 02:50:30.280]  marijuana pre-crime you're guilty until proven innocent oh my word you know it's
[02:50:30.280 --> 02:50:34.960]  amazing because having gone through litigation with the federal government I
[02:50:34.960 --> 02:50:39.680]  went through 18 audits and investigations and on several occasions Alex we were
[02:50:39.680 --> 02:50:44.000]  able to prove and document it's all up on the web that they tried to falsify
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:49.840]  evidence against us and that's before they had this kind of technology and it
[02:50:49.840 --> 02:50:54.760]  is another reason you want to be really involved with community and transparent
[02:50:54.760 --> 02:50:58.120]  within that community that what you're doing exactly stay there so you got
[02:50:58.120 --> 02:51:02.920]  witnesses so you got witnesses we'll be right back attention this is a special
[02:51:02.920 --> 02:51:06.040]  alert to all Americans who owe ten thousand dollars or more in back taxes
[02:51:06.040 --> 02:51:10.000]  to the IRS the IRS is now accepting reduced settlements from people who owe
[02:51:10.000 --> 02:51:13.840]  back taxes and dramatically lowering amounts owed due to the financial crisis
[02:51:13.840 --> 02:51:17.360]  in America the IRS has announced a leniency plan in recognition of
[02:51:17.360 --> 02:51:21.040]  consumers financial troubles in today's economy if you owe ten thousand dollars
[02:51:21.040 --> 02:51:24.760]  or more in back taxes to the IRS an open phone line has been established by
[02:51:24.760 --> 02:51:28.240]  American tax settlement for you to call and see if you qualify for a reduction
[02:51:28.240 --> 02:51:34.760]  by up to 75% number to call is 809 026 969 again the IRS is now accepting
[02:51:34.760 --> 02:51:38.680]  reduced settlements from consumers who owe back taxes in response to the decline
[02:51:38.680 --> 02:51:41.920]  in today's economy if you are struggling with ten thousand dollars or more in
[02:51:41.920 --> 02:51:45.800]  back taxes to the IRS you now may be eligible for a dramatic reduction by up
[02:51:45.800 --> 02:51:50.160]  to 75% and save thousands of dollars for free information and to see if you
[02:51:50.160 --> 02:51:55.560]  qualify call the open phone line into American tax settlement now 809 026 969
[02:51:55.560 --> 02:52:04.040]  809 026 969 again 809 026 969 the question is where should the American
[02:52:04.040 --> 02:52:09.880]  people draw their line in the sand what have we got a republic or a monarchy a
[02:52:09.880 --> 02:52:13.700]  republic is based on a constitution which protects minority rights not
[02:52:13.700 --> 02:52:17.960]  democracy not mob rule two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner so
[02:52:17.960 --> 02:52:21.480]  they think they own our land they think they're on our water children our
[02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:27.000]  education our money we have to define who we are and what we will tolerate

[02:54:33.000 --> 02:54:38.040]  care about the constitution earlier this year congressman Phil Hare has said it
[02:54:38.040 --> 02:54:44.480]  again that's up at GCN live dot com and a info wars dot com reader was arrested
[02:54:44.480 --> 02:54:47.640]  when they saw the police handcuffing a woman who they let go during a traffic
[02:54:47.640 --> 02:54:51.560]  stop he called him Nazi so they came over to his house and arrested him and
[02:54:51.560 --> 02:54:54.480]  the point is it's not nice to call him that but it is his first amendment
[02:54:54.480 --> 02:54:59.000]  that's up at GCN live dot com but but Catherine finishing up the last five
[02:54:59.000 --> 02:55:02.560]  minutes what type of collapse are you talking about of the big changes in the
[02:55:02.560 --> 02:55:06.880]  next year what's the time frame and your final comment on all this big brother
[02:55:06.880 --> 02:55:11.480]  control system they're racing to put in place I you know Alex I don't think we're
[02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:15.360]  looking at a collapse I think we're looking we've been in what I call a slow
[02:55:15.360 --> 02:55:19.880]  burn I think the slow burn is going to continue in the slow burn you have
[02:55:19.880 --> 02:55:24.760]  insiders and outsiders and the insiders protect themselves and financial assets
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:29.560]  like by basically draining the outsiders and what we're going to see on the you
[02:55:29.560 --> 02:55:35.720]  know among the outsiders is we're going to have to see a reconciling of overheads
[02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:41.000]  whether in households in state and local government in small business to much
[02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:45.880]  reduced cash flows and and much higher expenses and so the you know the
[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:50.880]  outsiders are going to continue to get drained and are going to have to you know
[02:55:50.880 --> 02:55:55.640]  both the the change is accelerating and that's good you know it's almost a
[02:55:55.640 --> 02:56:00.720]  grinding of the gears and and as that happens you're going to look for more
[02:56:00.720 --> 02:56:04.520]  and more controls instituted by the guys in the top so that they can continue to
[02:56:04.520 --> 02:56:10.160]  manage a process now that's North America what we're watching globally it's an
[02:56:10.160 --> 02:56:17.560]  effort to rebalance the global the global economy from one that's sort of in
[02:56:17.560 --> 02:56:22.200]  or or that where the motor is the American consumer to one that's rebalanced
[02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:27.320]  to the global consumers you're going to see that rebalancing going on as more
[02:56:27.320 --> 02:56:31.120]  and more assets continue to be moved out of ownership and control of government
[02:56:31.120 --> 02:56:35.840]  into corporations because we're looking for you know what they're looking for is
[02:56:35.840 --> 02:56:42.680]  that is a corporate managed planet that is much more top-down control and and
[02:56:42.680 --> 02:56:46.560]  that's a global plan and so we're watching them sort of proceed to do that
[02:56:46.560 --> 02:56:50.760]  and with twelve trillion dollars a bailout they have mighty resources to do
[02:56:50.760 --> 02:56:56.200]  it and that's why you know what what what you always hear me say is don't
[02:56:56.200 --> 02:56:59.800]  worry about whether or not there is a conspiracy if you're not in one you
[02:56:59.800 --> 02:57:04.000]  need to start one because we're watching the planet that's being managed by
[02:57:04.000 --> 02:57:09.080]  conspiracy so if if we want to provide an alternative to the central banking
[02:57:09.080 --> 02:57:14.560]  warfare model we have to start conspiring and it starts by conspiring in
[02:57:14.560 --> 02:57:19.400]  ways that protect you on the outside because we're looking at it at a
[02:57:19.400 --> 02:57:23.680]  situation where you're trying to be more stressed in your time your income is
[02:57:23.680 --> 02:57:28.320]  probably going to be under pressure to drop your expenses rising and you need
[02:57:28.320 --> 02:57:33.040]  to jump to the curb on that and that's going to require a conspiracy literally
[02:57:33.040 --> 02:57:37.800]  for us to start to circulate more of our cash flows to each other because right
[02:57:37.800 --> 02:57:41.960]  now we continue to shoot our cash whether it's purchases or investments or
[02:57:41.960 --> 02:57:46.560]  bank deposits or donations back to them so we're financing our own and we're
[02:57:46.560 --> 02:57:50.880]  financing the guy you're shooting at us and and so it's going to take you know
[02:57:50.880 --> 02:57:55.920]  conspiracies at the you know in your network and in your local area to start
[02:57:55.920 --> 02:58:00.640]  saying okay what are my short-term problems how do I start to barter how
[02:58:00.640 --> 02:58:05.320]  do I use pressure well they call it a conspiracy all it is is networking as a
[02:58:05.320 --> 02:58:09.480]  conspiracy they conspire to take over we've got to get organized take over
[02:58:09.480 --> 02:58:13.440]  our local communities politically but also individually and point out that
[02:58:13.440 --> 02:58:17.720]  they are the progenitors of our misery and that we've got to get out of their
[02:58:17.720 --> 02:58:23.160]  system absolutely but you know something we can create a lot more wealth than we
[02:58:23.160 --> 02:58:29.400]  can so we can win and you've got a lot of that key information at Solari.com
[02:58:29.400 --> 02:58:32.760]  Catherine Austin Fitz thanks for spending time with us on your vacation
