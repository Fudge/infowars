[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:24.000]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones man we have got a show
[00:24.000 --> 00:29.840]  that I'm so excited about and I had announced a few days ago that Lord Moncton was gonna be here
[00:29.840 --> 00:36.080]  in studio but then I got so busy this morning I forgot and and then there's Lord Moncton
[00:37.280 --> 00:42.320]  walking around the office really interesting person and has quite a presence in person
[00:43.040 --> 00:47.680]  so he's here and he's with us in studio in the second hour but I thought about why don't we just
[00:47.680 --> 00:52.160]  get him in here a half hour early so we have an hour and a half with him I think that's really
[00:52.160 --> 00:58.160]  important to do but he's back there checking email and doing news research so we're gonna have him
[00:58.160 --> 01:02.640]  with us and then Max Kaiser in the third hour he's been here in the United States the last few
[01:02.640 --> 01:07.680]  weeks normally over in France obviously it's going to be a great day to have him on because of the
[01:07.680 --> 01:12.480]  Facebook pump and dump but also the meltdown taking place in Europe that we've all predicted
[01:13.120 --> 01:20.400]  here with precision so that is coming up today last week Aaron comes to me he goes I'm doing the
[01:20.400 --> 01:25.600]  nightly news tonight I've done research the CIA's behind it they're going to pump and dump a hundred
[01:25.600 --> 01:31.200]  billion and sucker the Facebook people that know nothing about the stock market because the big
[01:31.200 --> 01:35.680]  analysts grips are saying there's nothing there but advertising there aren't products like Google
[01:35.680 --> 01:41.760]  and others have or even Microsoft or look at Apple products galore and innovative even though
[01:41.760 --> 01:46.960]  they're made at Foxconn by slaves and they have suicide nets the point is is that it's not based
[01:46.960 --> 01:53.600]  in tangibles way overvalued and then now they're claiming oh the problem in early
[01:53.600 --> 01:57.680]  tradings would cause this they probably did that on purpose so they could always say that was the
[01:57.680 --> 02:04.080]  problem and it's massively down huge pump and dump we're going to have Max Kaiser on about that in
[02:04.080 --> 02:08.320]  fact Max was coming on about the Euro meltdown but will you email Max so he knows well he'll be
[02:08.320 --> 02:11.360]  up on the pump and dump I don't even know that's his opinion it's a pump and dump but it is a pump
[02:11.360 --> 02:17.040]  and dump so and he's a former top stockbroker with the George Soros's son and people so he can
[02:17.040 --> 02:25.680]  certainly give us the inside scoop on all of those things that are taking place obviously there is
[02:25.680 --> 02:35.040]  massive news at info wars.com we are going to be I'm a little bit flummox because all of a sudden
[02:35.040 --> 02:39.040]  I go what is this a bunch of people in the studio like one minute before I go live or two minutes
[02:39.040 --> 02:44.240]  before I go live and I run out there and it's Lord Monkton and associates and I was admonished for
[02:44.240 --> 02:50.320]  not seeing properly actually that's a joke he did make a joke about that though and kind of got me
[02:50.320 --> 02:56.000]  off track but in a good way we're launching the new social network today and I'll tell you about
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.720]  that on the other side and we've been beta testing it quietly the people that are members of info
[03:00.720 --> 03:08.160]  wars insider that are members of the free email you can sign up on the side of info wars.com to
[03:08.160 --> 03:12.720]  that and it's already I don't know like 10,000 people or something on it without us even promoting
[03:12.720 --> 03:17.760]  it we just sent it out to some email folks that are members and some prison pilot TV subscribers
[03:17.760 --> 03:22.880]  and it's in beta and it's where you can post your photos your videos what you're into what you like
[03:22.880 --> 03:27.440]  groups you can join whether you want to meet people to go hunting or training for defense

[03:33.600 --> 03:37.680]  because last time we had a little social network that got like 30 something thousand members and
[03:37.680 --> 03:42.240]  crashed there's just a little plug in and I ran into so many people on the street that met each
[03:42.240 --> 03:47.600]  other and have children from it they're like I'm like wow of a tinker toy social network
[03:47.600 --> 03:51.520]  that we just did an alert that crashed after about six months and couldn't be revived

[08:24.160 --> 08:31.040]  well mark zuckerberg calls facebook users dumb bleepers he says these people trust me
[08:32.960 --> 08:39.600]  they're so stupid just like that movie face in the crowd that's exactly what the system
[08:39.600 --> 08:46.800]  thinks of the population and i hate con artists i hate people that pray on good innocent people
[08:47.520 --> 08:51.120]  and think it's cool and think it's funny and i told you last week
[08:51.840 --> 08:57.120]  actually erin dykes came to me like last monday we said you got to cover this it's cia
[08:57.760 --> 09:01.120]  all these people are involved well you remember he came on air and talked about it
[09:01.120 --> 09:05.360]  and i brought up the fact that i ran into the president of facebook uh the guy that started
[09:05.360 --> 09:10.480]  nabster at a party with billy corgan of smashing pumpkins and erin's like you're kidding is this
[09:10.480 --> 09:14.800]  the photo and i go yeah that's that's parker he goes you didn't know he's bilgerberg and i'm
[09:14.800 --> 09:19.840]  like no i just saw him run around for like three hours in a crazed fashion no kidding at a party
[09:20.560 --> 09:26.640]  like he was souped up on uh something but i looked in his eyes he looked like he was on drugs the
[09:26.640 --> 09:31.360]  point is and then erin's like no that's exactly what they say he acts like that's what the movie
[09:31.360 --> 09:38.400]  about him says he's like but my point is is that erin said they're gonna pump and dump and if people
[09:38.400 --> 09:43.760]  don't know what a pump and dump is you hype up a stock get all of the people that aren't savvy
[09:43.760 --> 09:52.080]  involved in it you dump it behind the scenes and then leave everybody holding the back and
[09:52.080 --> 09:57.600]  obviously uh it wasn't worth a hundred billion dollars at its initial offering obviously all
[09:57.600 --> 10:03.920]  these little face bookians ran in to get involved in it and it is just plunging right now plunging
[10:03.920 --> 10:09.440]  plunging plunging and the media is acting like it's funny and it's cute just like
[10:09.440 --> 10:13.360]  corsines stealing millions and refusing to give it back and being caught lying to congress and
[10:13.360 --> 10:18.880]  nobody gets in trouble this is a group of crooks people say well why are you on facebook then
[10:18.880 --> 10:24.240]  well listeners created more than 50 facebook accounts one guy had more than 20 he gave him
[10:24.240 --> 10:29.040]  to us one of them has like you know 300 000 likes another has 200 000 likes people following it
[10:30.320 --> 10:35.760]  and we've never we've used it as a beach head to inject our videos our articles our information
[10:36.640 --> 10:41.840]  you know our article last week about him being a scammer is up on our facebook so
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.600]  that's like saying why are you on a battlefield when the enemy is on the battlefield i mean that's
[10:49.600 --> 10:56.720]  that's moronic that's where the war is taking place that's where the fight is happening uh
[10:56.720 --> 11:01.840]  and so we're on twitter at real alex jones that's a total state department cia front just look it up
[11:01.840 --> 11:06.080]  i told you that before it was in the news now it's in the news google was founded by cia i told you
[11:06.080 --> 11:10.080]  that seven eight years ago with witnesses and experts gave me the names it's now commonplace
[11:10.080 --> 11:15.920]  knowledge i'm not bragging is just you better listen to what we say here because about 99%
[11:15.920 --> 11:19.840]  of the time it's stunningly accurate sometimes i'll listen to rebroadcast and just get something
[11:19.840 --> 11:24.240]  totally wrong because when you're talking for three hours every day your mind gets stuff twisted
[11:24.240 --> 11:30.000]  around the axle that happens to everybody but we try to tell the truth we try to be accurate we
[11:30.000 --> 11:34.480]  try to get it right we try to give you piercing in-depth analysis with facts
[11:37.120 --> 11:42.960]  the system tries to dumb it all down as a feedback loop to dumb down society so a full
[11:42.960 --> 11:48.320]  hour with max keiser coming up lord mongton in studio for an hour and a half coming up in about
[11:48.320 --> 11:55.920]  20 minutes um you do not want to miss that all of that said um we meant to launch the social
[11:55.920 --> 12:00.560]  network a year ago got busy with other commitments with the nightly news getting that launched all
[12:00.560 --> 12:04.560]  the other things we're doing hiring reporters beefing up the staff trying to get the sponsors
[12:04.560 --> 12:12.160]  be able to pay for everything we've successfully gotten up to that level thanks to your support
[12:13.520 --> 12:16.960]  certainly not to mine the sales guys are always you're not plugging the sponsors
[12:16.960 --> 12:21.200]  you're they've paid for this you've got it you've got to get this done even though i love the
[12:21.200 --> 12:26.160]  sponsors i just get so busy covering the news but uh the point is is that we're building this media
[12:26.160 --> 12:30.240]  operation in the face of the globalist they might shut us down tomorrow it might be in 10 years we
[12:30.240 --> 12:38.960]  might beat them today is the rest of our lives we can change our destinies today if we take action
[12:39.520 --> 12:46.560]  your destiny your fate is in your hands we are not pathetic little spectators that can be defeated
[12:46.560 --> 12:53.200]  but it's interesting that all of the problems we've had all the preparation because i because
[12:53.200 --> 13:00.080]  it's got a lot of nice features but it's also elegant and simple in ways our new social network
[13:00.080 --> 13:07.520]  planet info wars dot com it is very beefy so that it can handle millions of people using it
[13:08.480 --> 13:17.200]  as we scale it up so we are officially launching it here today in the midst of the big cia globalist
[13:17.200 --> 13:22.560]  you know silicon valley mafia builder berg group literally there's like four builder
[13:22.560 --> 13:29.280]  berg group guys in facebook we are launching this not as a challenge to it it's obviously
[13:29.280 --> 13:33.600]  not going to get 200 million people on it it gets a million i'll be absolutely happy
[13:34.960 --> 13:39.920]  it's that it's a place for those of us that love liberty to organize and get together
[13:39.920 --> 13:44.880]  talk show host other websites i was on mancow show this morning invited him to come set up

[14:05.360 --> 14:09.840]  who are into guns or into manufacturing or there are people that want to promote businesses

[14:15.600 --> 14:24.640]  reenactment militia whatever the case is it's all there but again no porn there's you put people
[14:24.640 --> 14:30.640]  with bikinis on your website that's fine with me nothing wrong with god's creations but i don't want
[14:30.640 --> 14:37.040]  porn i don't want calls to violence we're not going to have stalking on there uh you know we're
[14:37.040 --> 14:42.560]  not going to have you know people uh defaming little guys you want to attack big people that's
[14:42.560 --> 14:53.760]  your site we're going to have a pretty light hand to this when it comes to to uh to you know i don't
[14:53.760 --> 15:01.120]  know the word you'd use it's not it's not censor but it's it's protect the site um and i'm training
[15:01.120 --> 15:06.160]  the people on basically it being pretty wild west but we're going to follow all the laws
[15:06.160 --> 15:12.480]  and everything and it's under dmca so people make you know claims on the material and then
[15:12.480 --> 15:17.600]  it'll be taken down but but plus we don't host anything on the site your photos everything
[15:17.600 --> 15:21.920]  are linked in your videos are linked in and so we're not going to have a lot of issues with that
[15:21.920 --> 15:26.880]  the point is i'm kind of getting into technical matters that don't matter we are launching it
[15:26.880 --> 15:32.080]  please help us get it out to everybody please email your email please twitter it please facebook

[34:44.640 --> 34:50.320]  the air about creating a social network but i was so busy with my radio show the documentaries all of
[34:50.320 --> 34:56.160]  it but i never did it properly we launched a small little plug-in social network it got more than 40
[34:56.160 --> 35:01.600]  thousand members in just a few months and basically crashed and then i never revisited the subject
[35:01.600 --> 35:07.760]  until the last year and i went out to a public event a ufc fight jill rogan invited me to it in
[35:07.760 --> 35:14.720]  austin and two different couples came up to me and said man we wish you'd set up a social network
[35:14.720 --> 35:19.760]  again where did it go and i said i was just some little free program it couldn't handle all the
[35:19.760 --> 35:25.840]  traffic and in both cases at that same evening they said we met four different people two couples
[35:25.840 --> 35:31.760]  on your little plug-in site at info wars dot com and we now have children and since then it's happened
[35:31.760 --> 35:37.600]  a couple other times so i realized a social network is important so people who love freedom can get

[37:12.560 --> 37:16.560]  with us we're going to have in just a moment but here's some of the new headlines out there's a
[37:16.560 --> 37:22.480]  new term out there and no it's not charlie sheen saying winning this is losing the new term is
[37:22.480 --> 37:29.040]  not suckered or scammed it's suckered after the founder and the guy that called his users dumb
[37:29.040 --> 37:36.880]  efforts well he is in a lot of trouble obviously as the pump and dump gets exposed we told you last
[37:36.880 --> 37:40.800]  week at all the hallmarks of a pump and dump if you don't know what a pump and dump is they get a
[37:40.800 --> 37:46.800]  bunch of suckers who aren't savvy in the stock market casino in there sell it for a lot more than
[37:46.800 --> 37:50.880]  it's worth and why should those doing it care because they're just going to profit either
[37:50.880 --> 37:57.440]  way and be able to sell it off and that's what's already happening morgan stanley is under review
[37:57.440 --> 38:05.280]  for it nasdaq would have pulled stock again they're calling it suckered massachusetts the
[38:05.280 --> 38:11.680]  state of subpoenaing investors are suing insiders got greedy they knew the jig was up that the site
[38:11.680 --> 38:19.040]  was already starting to decline having problems even zuckerberg so sold now ladies and gentlemen
[38:19.040 --> 38:25.120]  if he didn't go to jail remember martha stewart she sold almost nothing in her stock and was
[38:25.120 --> 38:29.760]  routinely doing it didn't do anything wrong i've reviewed it had a lot of experts on she went to
[38:29.760 --> 38:34.400]  prison because the big corrupt people on wall street the insider cronies most of them like
[38:34.400 --> 38:39.600]  colman sacks funding the global warming movement they're above the law mf global head corezine
[38:39.600 --> 38:44.560]  billions disappear wires it to london lies and says he didn't comes out in congress he did
[38:45.360 --> 38:49.360]  chicago mercantil exchange head comes out and says no he was in the meetings he did order it
[38:50.480 --> 38:57.600]  doesn't get in trouble if zuckerberg does not get in trouble ladies and gentlemen this is
[38:57.600 --> 39:07.760]  incredible the fact that he sold that day it went public that is insider trading up one side
[39:07.760 --> 39:12.640]  down the other what an arrogant person even if he thinks his users are dumb efforts as he said
[39:12.640 --> 39:17.520]  for trusting him why would he say that in an interview these people are arrogant i've been
[39:17.520 --> 39:23.200]  at parties with the president of facebook a few months ago when the head of smashing pumpkins
[39:23.200 --> 39:28.560]  took me to big party south by southwest al gordon town but he wasn't at the meeting at the party
[39:28.560 --> 39:33.280]  and some of these guys are running around the point is they're very arrogant i was taken back
[39:33.280 --> 39:39.760]  by how arrogant and on power trips they are and pride go before a fall and this is incredible
[39:39.760 --> 39:47.680]  if martha steward went to prison then zuckerberg's got to go he's got to go he's got to go i mean
[39:47.680 --> 39:52.080]  most the experts were saying this stock was going to tank but he was up there hyping saying it was a
[39:52.080 --> 39:58.480]  good uh you know first release of the stock it was great this looks like and has all the
[39:58.480 --> 40:05.520]  earmarks of text book text book insider trading but again they like to burn somebody like martha
[40:05.520 --> 40:09.600]  steward the average person thinks she's rich when she's nothing compared to these billionaire
[40:09.600 --> 40:14.320]  scammers and meanwhile the billionaire scammers are always pushing in wall street for higher taxes
[40:14.320 --> 40:19.040]  because they get that money through banker bailouts they're the ones right across the line pushing
[40:19.040 --> 40:24.560]  carbon taxes it was ken lay of enron came up with that then they blame capitalism for what they've
[40:24.560 --> 40:29.680]  done and say bring in socialism to fix it when they've impoverished the country via their environmentalist
[40:29.680 --> 40:36.640]  dictatorship it's amazing so we're going to be breaking that down today uh also the very same
[40:36.640 --> 40:41.760]  banksters that set up the euro to consolidate power are now posing as the savers as they imploded
[40:41.760 --> 40:46.240]  greece is mulling euro exit all goldman sacks run most the debt's not theirs it's owed by the big
[40:46.240 --> 40:50.880]  mega banks and derivatives euro zone nations told to prep for greek departure told you that was
[40:50.880 --> 40:59.120]  coming last year uh in europe time for big b only there's no plan and no time market swamp ahead of
[40:59.120 --> 41:05.200]  the key eu summit i'll be confronting bill billard burr group next week live from chantele virginia
[41:05.200 --> 41:11.200]  be sure and join us each day for that i'll be hosting from the road uh we've got lord christopher
[41:11.200 --> 41:16.960]  mocton here with us and he was just coming on for an hour but he got here early which is great
[41:18.320 --> 41:22.000]  and so we're going to have him a little bit in this shower but since he's here i'm going to spring
[41:22.000 --> 41:26.720]  something on him but i know he's written and talked about this and advised margaret thatcher
[41:26.720 --> 41:30.720]  you know on a lot of issues he can speak on any of this because he's part of the uk independence
[41:30.720 --> 41:36.080]  party one of its founders and then its head as well about what's happening with the euro how it fits
[41:36.080 --> 41:41.040]  into this larger tyranny how it's driving the move towards global governance and then we'll segway
[41:41.040 --> 41:47.040]  in the next hour into the big view of where we are on the chessboard now with the forces of
[41:47.040 --> 41:53.600]  authoritarianism age-old reinventing themselves under the rubric of savers of the earth vanquishing
[41:53.600 --> 41:59.360]  evil carbon dioxide that plants respirate from and then put forth uh oxygen in the carbon life
[41:59.360 --> 42:03.040]  cycle on this planet while ignoring all the real environmental problems we're going to cover the
[42:03.040 --> 42:09.760]  entire waterfront with a strategic uh speech and breakdown in my questions uh coming up in the next
[42:09.760 --> 42:15.040]  hour but now with lord mocton here in studio i want to get a briefing from him uh because he's
[42:15.040 --> 42:21.280]  over in england he's been on this uh with uh uh members of the european parliament which is of
[42:21.280 --> 42:27.280]  course just ceremonial but uh still able to use it as a bully pulpit in a nigel ferrage who has
[42:27.280 --> 42:32.720]  survived the uh suspicious plane crash to bring us this information he's been in there excoriating
[42:32.720 --> 42:40.240]  these criminals they are criminals all of this he can give us the uh crowsness of view from inside
[42:40.240 --> 42:44.960]  what's happening and what this means to the rest of the world because if the euro falls before they're
[42:44.960 --> 42:49.680]  ready to leverage it into their new world order this could damage this whole new world order
[42:49.680 --> 42:55.120]  much worse than the copenhagen documents i mean again we have this idea that they're invincible
[42:55.120 --> 43:00.400]  and we can't defeat them that's not true history shows that when the good take the field the dragons
[43:00.400 --> 43:06.000]  can and will be slayed now lord christopher mocton is the chief policy advisor to the science of
[43:06.000 --> 43:10.560]  public policy institute special advisor to british prime minister margaret thatcher who was anti-new
[43:10.560 --> 43:15.600]  world order uh spoke out against bill berg mocton is a widely recognized expert on climate uh
[43:15.600 --> 43:21.200]  sensitivity uh and uh he of course is given key lectures at cambridge university uh he heads up
[43:21.200 --> 43:26.800]  the biggest website exposing scientifically their fraud he's been proven right at a ridiculous level
[43:26.800 --> 43:33.680]  almost almost psychic in how he guesses their their next move and exposes them and he joins us
[43:33.680 --> 43:39.600]  here today lord montan great to have you well alex it's a real joy to be here and meet you in studio
[43:39.600 --> 43:44.240]  for the first time i tell you it is great to uh to have you here in person and i notice you have
[43:44.240 --> 43:49.040]  your uh your your your crucifix around your neck to ward off al gore i'm going to tell you why i'm
[43:49.040 --> 43:54.640]  wearing this this is my david cameron crucifix now david cameron is the allegedly conservative but in
[43:54.640 --> 44:00.720]  fact i think it's fair to say largely socialist prime minister of the uk and he has applied to
[44:00.720 --> 44:05.680]  our you our new european masters because us britain britain's parliament has no more power to take
[44:05.680 --> 44:12.400]  decisions for itself even on little things it has applied to europe to these bureaucrats who now
[44:12.400 --> 44:18.800]  governors who are not elected by anyone he's asked them for the right to ban the wearing of crucifixes
[44:18.800 --> 44:24.400]  in public in britain and you can imagine that the churches don't like this wait a minute i saw
[44:24.400 --> 44:28.560]  that didn't even make an issue out of it that's how conditioned i've gotten hold on you just said
[44:28.560 --> 44:36.080]  banning wearing crucifix i mean this is beyond 1984 oh it's way beyond 1984 and the extraordinary
[44:36.080 --> 44:40.400]  thing was that apart from a little bit in the newspapers at the time it all went very quiet
[44:40.400 --> 44:47.920]  thereafter quietly now his lawyers are in there applying to the european dictatorship for the
[44:47.920 --> 44:53.920]  right to ban the wearing of crucifixes now you can wear a turban you can wear a hijab you can
[44:53.920 --> 44:59.920]  wear a kefir but you can't wear a crucifix i'm going to start wearing one i mean that's the only
[44:59.920 --> 45:03.760]  jewelry that i'm attracted to is a small silver crucifix i'm going to get one and i'm going to
[45:03.760 --> 45:09.600]  tell you the story of this one because i was at a climate change meeting in san diego and i was
[45:09.600 --> 45:14.560]  giving a speech there 500 people turned up from all over the san diego this is california even
[45:14.560 --> 45:18.560]  there there are people sensible enough to know that this global warming rubbish isn't all it's
[45:18.560 --> 45:23.200]  cracked up to be on the way and i was shaking people by the hand as they came in and one of them
[45:23.200 --> 45:29.440]  was wearing this very fine crucifix and i congratulated him on wearing it and being proud to do so
[45:29.440 --> 45:34.000]  and i said i told him a story about david cameron applying to our european bosses to
[45:34.000 --> 45:40.720]  have this band in britain and i said i was going to go straight back to the uk get myself a crucifix
[45:40.720 --> 45:45.360]  and put it on around my neck and wear it everywhere however embarrassing that might be
[45:45.360 --> 45:50.400]  for those i was doing business with or whatever because it's necessary that we should not allow
[45:50.400 --> 45:56.160]  this sort of stamping out of religion but i liked it when i saw it it's very nice and and anyway
[45:56.160 --> 46:00.400]  so he very kindly at the end of the meeting he said that was a great speech and he said i think
[46:00.400 --> 46:05.600]  you should have this crucifix because you're going to wear it it'll do some good and you'll
[46:05.600 --> 46:10.560]  spread the message better that way than i ever can and he was really kind he put it around my neck
[46:10.560 --> 46:15.200]  and it's been there ever since that's it i'm getting a little silver one i like the little silver
[46:15.200 --> 46:20.400]  that's it yeah i know i know both my daughters i gave them both a crucifix but i mean you could
[46:20.400 --> 46:24.640]  make the joke here but it's not a joke i mean we know these people are psychic vampires they hate
[46:24.640 --> 46:29.680]  freedom they want to suck it out of society they are parasites but maybe they are vampires i'm being
[46:29.680 --> 46:36.960]  sarcastic but well i think what has happened is that the governing class has become dangerously
[46:36.960 --> 46:43.280]  arrogant and dangerously remote from the ordinary people now in europe this is particularly severe
[46:43.280 --> 46:48.480]  because we are no longer a democracy we are governed by an oligarchy we're governed by
[46:48.480 --> 46:54.960]  about 30 commissars that's the official german name for the commissioners of the european union
[46:54.960 --> 47:00.640]  who have dug us into the enormous financial mess which i think we should now move on to this
[47:00.640 --> 47:06.480]  and and what is happening here is that the governing class of the world thought it could get away
[47:06.480 --> 47:12.640]  with a treaty at copenhagen which would have created an all-powerful world government unelected
[47:12.640 --> 47:20.080]  by anyone no mention in the 186 pages of that treaty draft of election democracy ballot or vote
[47:20.080 --> 47:26.480]  they were going to try that on they tried to set up the the euro not as a currency but as an instrument
[47:26.480 --> 47:32.800]  of grim socialistic political centralization and what is happening is that on the on the climate
[47:32.800 --> 47:39.760]  project and on the euro project they have failed these people who are arrogant enough to think
[47:39.760 --> 47:47.120]  that they know better than we the people do they are failing they've failed catastrophically with
[47:47.120 --> 47:53.680]  the global warming scare everybody now knows that they oversold that one and indeed it's now
[47:53.680 --> 48:01.440]  official because in 2008 the national oceanographic and atmospheric administration one of the cheer
[48:01.440 --> 48:09.040]  leaders for the global warming movement said that all right there'd be no warming for 10 years at
[48:09.040 --> 48:15.680]  that time but that was too short a period but if the lack of warming continued for another five years
[48:15.680 --> 48:22.560]  then that would prove the models wrong and we've had no more warming in that following five years
[48:22.560 --> 48:28.720]  has now been 15 years perhaps even 20 on some I saw the german government last week came out and said
[48:28.720 --> 48:33.760]  that global warming has stopped yeah but they're trying to clear victory in a bizarre way yes i mean
[48:33.760 --> 48:37.440]  they're trying to pretend that this is because they they built a few windmills well that's not
[48:37.440 --> 48:42.000]  going to make any difference fact is the amount of carbon dioxide being emitted to atmosphere
[48:42.000 --> 48:48.240]  is rising and rising at an ever more rapid rate as places like china industrialize and
[48:48.240 --> 48:53.280]  they're not going to just do this with windmills how far is that going to get thank god thank god
[48:53.280 --> 48:58.880]  because from all the scientists i've had on if carbon dioxide's been 10 20 30 times higher
[48:58.880 --> 49:03.440]  they admit this is one of the lowest levels of carbon dioxide in planetary history i think we
[49:03.440 --> 49:08.880]  should have factories producing more of it well that's what power stations are of course and china
[49:08.880 --> 49:14.080]  knows that if it's going to compete economically with the west because it's still the per capita
[49:14.080 --> 49:18.960]  income in china is tiny because they're running this ghastly communized centralized economy where
[49:18.960 --> 49:24.400]  once again the governing class thinks it knows best and the people struggle under this they
[49:24.400 --> 49:27.920]  they've they've of course they've gone fashion they've gone for these windmills which are sort of
[49:27.920 --> 49:32.720]  fashion statement really but three quarters of the windmills in china aren't actually turning
[49:32.720 --> 49:36.960]  they're just there to make it look as though china is doing something about this what you want to
[49:36.960 --> 49:42.480]  if you want to know what china's doing you go to the annual statistical communique of the people's
[49:42.480 --> 49:47.840]  republic of china issued from p king once a year and they tell you then what they're going to do and
[49:47.840 --> 49:51.680]  the great thing about a dictatorship is that when they publish a communique say we're going to do
[49:51.680 --> 49:57.040]  this this and this over the next five 10 15 years then that is what they're going to do and they have
[49:57.040 --> 50:02.960]  said they're going to build one or two new coal fired power stations every week from now for the
[50:02.960 --> 50:08.080]  foreseeable future and we can't have any here no no no they're they're here for shutting them down
[50:08.080 --> 50:14.240]  there are more than 150 projects for new coal fired power stations on hold here in the united
[50:14.240 --> 50:20.320]  states at the moment because while you have got the manchurian candidate in the white house uh
[50:20.320 --> 50:24.480]  he's not going to allow any of these things to be built and so what is happening is that industries
[50:24.480 --> 50:30.480]  one by one are having to move 20 billion of our taxpayer money paid to move general motors to
[50:30.480 --> 50:34.640]  china and now china said they bought up our biggest movie theater company and they're buying
[50:34.640 --> 50:40.800]  media and they said to influence our media this is sedition and treason by our criminal government
[50:40.800 --> 50:44.880]  it's been hijacked by globalist lord christopher montan is our guest we'll give you his website
[50:44.880 --> 50:50.400]  we come back be sure and write it down and check it out and get it out to everybody we are facing
[50:50.400 --> 50:54.960]  total tyranny just like our ancestors have over and over again we're going to get his take on the
[50:54.960 --> 51:00.160]  collapse of the eu straight ahead and then a whole hour on the environmental tyrants
[51:03.200 --> 51:07.600]  folks have you lost your power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on
[51:07.600 --> 51:11.760]  if so this is going to be the most important message you'll ever hear because there's never
[51:11.760 --> 51:17.840]  been a better time to get ready for the winter power outages ahead here's why solar power generators
[51:17.840 --> 51:22.720]  are now available from our friends at solutions from science one of our oldest sponsors their
[51:22.720 --> 51:27.760]  emergency backup systems provide life-saving electrical power when you need it most unlike
[51:27.760 --> 51:33.200]  gas generators a solar generator runs quietly amidst no fumes and produces electricity from the
[51:33.200 --> 51:38.080]  sun it's like having an electric power plant running quietly in your own own whether it's
[51:38.080 --> 51:43.520]  ice storms brownouts or blackouts you'll never have to suffer through painful power outages again
[51:43.520 --> 51:48.400]  when the power goes out this winter you'll be ready with a solar power generator from solutions

[54:26.080 --> 54:32.160]  and public policy dot org you can also see the daily mail it's also in the bbc minister in legal
[54:32.160 --> 54:38.560]  battle to stop christians being able to wear a cross at work will show prisonplanet.tv viewers
[54:38.560 --> 54:44.960]  via document cam a shot of that there it is governments legal fight against the right to
[54:44.960 --> 54:50.800]  wear a cross at work brings accusations it's sidelining christianity and then here's another
[54:50.800 --> 54:56.400]  article ministers in legal battle just to stop wearing a period so that's how it always is
[54:56.400 --> 55:00.560]  take your cross down take your christmas tree down which is germanic it's not really christian
[55:01.200 --> 55:04.960]  but we're going to put up menorahs we're going to put up muslim stuff buddha stuff
[55:04.960 --> 55:10.400]  and i'm not offended by any of that but i mean why why are our crosses so bad and again it's
[55:10.400 --> 55:17.040]  about we're going to tell you what we're going to do and and there is an outrage at move towards
[55:17.040 --> 55:25.200]  banning christian crosses from workplace right to ban crucifixes in school classrooms
[55:26.000 --> 55:30.240]  that's what the soviets tried that that was the final straw that was what triggered
[55:30.880 --> 55:37.440]  finally the breaking free of poland from the communist bloc that was just one thing too far
[55:37.440 --> 55:42.640]  and sometimes it is these apparently little things that indicate to the ordinary people
[55:42.640 --> 55:49.680]  that their government simply doesn't care about them at all well i think the tsa is a breaking
[55:49.680 --> 55:55.760]  point absolutely yeah and that wakes people up and you're beginning to see this now because the
[55:55.760 --> 56:02.480]  catholic church the bishops unfortunately in england and wales are way to the left and they tend to
[56:02.480 --> 56:07.520]  go along with all this sort of stuff they've gone along for instance with that they've had to close
[56:07.520 --> 56:12.880]  down all their adopt catholic adoption agencies in britain because the government came along a
[56:12.880 --> 56:18.720]  socialist governor tony blair and said you can't operate an adoption agency unless you will send
[56:18.720 --> 56:24.720]  children for adoption to homosexual couples and they said but homosexuality is against our religion
[56:24.720 --> 56:30.560]  people who come to a catholic adoption agency do not expect to find well they're now saying that here
[56:30.560 --> 56:35.440]  and they're saying you're going to pay for abortions and and you're going to hire non christians but
[56:35.440 --> 56:42.880]  here you have proper bishops cardinal dolan and all the bishops here and some 20 catholic
[56:42.880 --> 56:47.760]  organizations have got together they're suing suing the pants off the obama administration
[56:47.760 --> 56:55.360]  and they're saying don't you tread any further on our religious freedom which is guaranteed under
[56:55.360 --> 57:00.880]  isn't the first yes first amendment first amendment of the congress shall make no law
[57:00.880 --> 57:05.280]  respecting an establishment establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof
[57:05.280 --> 57:10.800]  i have it here uh or prohibiting the free exercise thereof and the free exercise of religion
[57:10.800 --> 57:16.960]  surely show us that evil document here we are this is your founding fathers intention for your
[57:16.960 --> 57:23.280]  country this is your birthright this is your constitution i wear it close to my heart i bring

[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:27.920]  lord christopher montan is our guest for the rest of the hour then max keiser with big breaking news
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:34.080]  lord montan we're going to shift gears into the globalist battle plan how we defeat them
[01:00:34.080 --> 01:00:38.320]  but for those that don't know this is a global standardized model they're trying to do the
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.880]  same stuff first it's terror they say they'll disappear you we have a bill of rights they're
[01:00:42.880 --> 01:00:47.520]  just ignoring it with the ndaa but for those that don't know first they start this national anti-terror
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:52.960]  group now they admit it's for everybody they can just disappear you i've seen them spying on members
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:58.480]  of parliament that are trying to rein them in and then raiding them that i mean these are not so
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:02.480]  this is this is real tyranny when the bureaucracy does this we're going to put their website on
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:08.720]  screen tell folks about it and the immensely feeble speaker of the house did not stop them coming in
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:14.240]  she you know there could have been an order made don't you think about it mate but no they went along
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:20.880]  with it it was absolutely outrageous this happened a year or two ago now and this secret police force
[01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:27.120]  is completely out of it they came after me once this was terribly funny and i complained about
[01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:32.160]  them because they had not the slightest basis for coming after me and i put in a formal complaint
[01:01:32.160 --> 01:01:37.600]  about it and they sent two policemen up to our estate in scotland to interview me about it
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:42.160]  and they went away and they produced a report saying that they had tried to interview me under
[01:01:42.160 --> 01:01:47.920]  caution that means they suspected of a criminal offense which in fact they didn't and that i had
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:53.040]  fled to my residence in northern cyprus this was put in the report of the people i had asked to
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:59.760]  investigate my complaint from the secret police so i hit the roof i thought there's no point in
[01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:04.160]  messing around anymore it's a culture of total line what they'd done was they'd put this report
[01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:08.560]  about because they wanted to show to ministers who had become interested in the way i'd been treated
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:15.840]  that i was a crook that was the aim and so i then thought right no more mr nice guy
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:20.640]  i walked in to my nearest magistrates court which was horse ferry road in london i was in london
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:27.840]  at the time i told them the story i said this is what's happened i have never had any residence
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:33.680]  in northern cyprus nor have i fled there i have been in and out of london quite openly from my
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:38.640]  residence in southern cyprus which is part of the eu for heaven's sake they could come there
[01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:44.400]  and get me anytime they wanted and i've been openly in and out of london and there's absolutely no
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:50.800]  basis for what they've written here and i want these people to be summoned to answer a charge
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:56.000]  of willful misfeasants in a public office which is a very serious charge for which you can go to
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:02.400]  prison for life i said i want them to be brought here to court to answer my charges so the magistrates
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:07.360]  had recessed for half an hour to read the paperwork they came back in and they said mr
[01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:12.320]  monkton this was a few years ago before i was a law they said mr monkton we've read the paperwork
[01:03:12.320 --> 01:03:18.720]  we do not intend to hear you because we are going to order the secret police to appear
[01:03:18.720 --> 01:03:26.240]  we are going to summon them as you have requested next week so three days passed and this was a
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:33.120]  great victory because 99 percent of cases in the magistrates court lead to convictions so i had
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:39.120]  reversed their usual ratio now they were in the frames they were in danger of being convicted
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:42.880]  of a very serious criminal offense which would have led them to being imprisoned perhaps for life
[01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:49.040]  the secret police the head of the secret police so i got them to come to court and what they tried
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:52.880]  to do was they got in touch with the clerk of the court and they said can you just lose the
[01:03:52.880 --> 01:03:58.000]  paperwork that said that monkton was ever more criminality so the the clerk of the court i rang
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  him three days after i'd had the hearing i said i haven't had any confirmation paper to say that
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:07.760]  this case has been set down for a hearing and the clerk of the court said you were never here
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:13.520]  i said just one moment i've only just rung you you haven't had a chance to check any of your record
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:19.680]  and yet you already knew or were willing to say that i hadn't been here now you're involved in the
[01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:25.680]  crime i said has somebody been getting at you because i think they have i said look i wasn't
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:33.040]  born yesterday i know just how criminal this country has now become how even court clerks at
[01:04:33.040 --> 01:04:38.960]  horse free road magistrates can find themselves drawn in to this corruption of the secret police
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:42.960]  stay there i want to recap the story and finish it on the other side okay come back this is this
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:48.480]  is demonstrating the police state of the e you that's what you're under yeah what 80 plus percent
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:52.960]  of your laws are now made by these unelected bureaucrats high six wow we're gonna come back
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:57.280]  break this down and then get into their plan for global domination with lord christopher montan

[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:26.560]  five minute about that what you've experienced with the secret police yeah now you may find
[01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:30.640]  it surprising there is such a thing as a secret police in britain but we do have one i was founded
[01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:36.000]  by the labor government in 1998 it was then called the national crime squad then it became the
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.800]  serious organized crime agency and next month it's going to be called the crime agency these people
[01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:46.480]  came after me and some clients of mine on a totally spurious jump trumped up charge
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:52.560]  and because they behaved so badly i made an official complaint about them which unfortunately
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:57.200]  was conducted internally by them rather than externally by somebody and they put out a report
[01:09:57.200 --> 01:10:01.200]  saying that you had fled when you had that's why they said i fled the country when they had asked
[01:10:01.200 --> 01:10:06.240]  to interview me under caution i hadn't fled the country i had been openly there in and out of my
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:12.240]  uh place i then lived in in southern cyprus part of the eu the northern turkish bit they said i'd
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:17.360]  fled to my residence in turkish northern cyprus i don't have a residence i never have had i've
[01:10:17.360 --> 01:10:22.880]  only been there once and so the whole thing and that was on a parliamentary delegation 25 years
[01:10:22.880 --> 01:10:28.160]  ago so the whole thing was trumped up and i got them into the magistrates court i went straight
[01:10:28.160 --> 01:10:31.680]  to the magistrate court i said i'm telling my own story i'm not even going to hire a lawyer they've
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:37.040]  behaved so badly i reckon i can tell the magistrates and they will find in my favor and they said yes
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:44.240]  we are ordering the secret police to come to court next week and answer the charges so three days
[01:10:44.240 --> 01:10:48.720]  later when i rang the court said why haven't i had confirmation that this hearing is on next week
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:52.960]  the clerk of the court immediately said you were never here i said hang on a moment you
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:57.680]  haven't had a chance to check your records have you done a deal with the secret police to erase
[01:10:57.680 --> 01:11:03.280]  all record of the magistrates finding i guess that's what you've done i said let me tell you this
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:11.200]  i will have you for conspiracy with the secret police to pervert the course of justice unless
[01:11:11.200 --> 01:11:19.760]  within five minutes you find this record you say never existed because let me make this clear i
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:25.840]  know your sort i know i can't trust even the bureaucrats in court anymore i can trust the
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:31.120]  magistrates because they are not part of the the network they're ordinary people like you or me
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.320]  who do the judging they're not even lawyers but i said you court clerks you get into
[01:11:36.320 --> 01:11:42.560]  bed with the police and i know how corrupt you all are together and i had witnesses in the court
[01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:47.280]  i had a barrister there who was part of another case i had somebody sitting in the public gallery
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:53.280]  i had a journalist there we had three separate witnesses who saw me there and saw the magistrate
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:12:00.080]  and took a shorthand note of his finding so you find that paperwork within five minutes and ring
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:05.120]  me back and tell me you found it or you go to jail mate i'm not going to have this messing around
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:11.600]  four minutes later he came back and said oh uh we found the paperwork i said yes i rather
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:16.720]  thought you had now i don't expect any further interference with this case do i make myself
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:21.360]  clear and you are yourself not to appear as the clerk in the case i want a different clerk
[01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:26.560]  recuse yourself yeah he was just a clerk the clerk you would call it uh sitting underneath
[01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:30.480]  the bench and doing the legal bit the clerks illegally trained the magistrates and not and
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:34.000]  again you have members of parliament being threatened and raided by the bureaucracy you've
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:39.280]  been i was just mentioning what i'd read and it's happened to you yeah this is the secret police
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:44.320]  let me tell you what then happened i went to court five of the secret police plus a barrister turned
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:50.320]  up and i did a deal with them i said look you know we can do this the hard way and go into court
[01:12:50.320 --> 01:12:55.120]  and the magistrates essentially having summoned you here are going to find against you because you
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:58.960]  you've behaved very badly you've done this so as to try to make it out to ministers
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:04.080]  then i'm a crook and that's disgraceful particularly when i had put in a complaint
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:09.680]  about the previous disgraceful conduct of this organization and i said this is not acceptable
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:13.680]  i want a letter of apology from the head of the secret police it containing an
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:19.760]  undertaking that you will all leave me alone from here on and i got it no argument whatsoever
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:24.080]  they just caved in and said okay and they got off my case you're about the only person i know
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:29.680]  that's brought him to heal instead as you mentioned even the speaker of the commons is scared of them
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:33.120]  that's right but the next thing that happened it happened just a few weeks ago this is real
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:41.520]  breaking news is that i was got an email from somebody calling himself dr paul mcallum and
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:47.840]  he said that he had a company and he wanted to develop an invention of mine the eternity puzzle
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:52.240]  which has sold you know a million copies worldwide he said i want to develop it further and i have
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:56.160]  some ideas and can we yeah you're a big inventor we should add that you're really understanding
[01:13:56.160 --> 01:14:01.520]  yeah and i so he came and had a drink at my club and he made me sign a non-disclosure agreement
[01:14:01.520 --> 01:14:07.440]  and i made him sign one usual kind of business exchange but i read his non-disclosure agreement
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:17.760]  it contained a clause saying this this nothing in this agreement shall wave the liability of either
[01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:24.000]  party for fraud now that is not a standard term in a non-disclosure agreement that had been put
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:30.400]  there because this was in fact the internal revenue service the inland revenue trying to
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.400]  get information about my private financial affairs to see if they could find a way back in
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.120]  because they were with the sink they're sending spies after you they sent a spy his name was
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:49.280]  dr paul mcallum and he has a company called daibutsu limited and daibutsu limited is a front
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:53.680]  company set up by the inland revenue it hasn't traded or if it has for those that don't know
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:59.280]  that's your irs that's the irs that's that's right it's the internal revenue service and
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:06.800]  this was quite clearly an attempt by the the irs to find information from in our course i
[01:15:06.800 --> 01:15:10.720]  spotted this and again they're politically after you when everybody knows you're squeaky clean
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:17.360]  that's it and in fact they did have and i must be very honest here some justification for asking
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:21.040]  some questions which if they'd been honest they would have lifted the phone and just asked me
[01:15:21.600 --> 01:15:26.400]  i owed them some tax in fact on this invention because i'd had a large royalty payment
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:32.160]  and they knew this because my partners had all paid tax on it so they knew roughly how much i
[01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:36.960]  should have paid and they hadn't had the money and instead of asking why they hadn't had the money
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:41.600]  they go through this hole in corner nonsense what had happened was i had said to my lovely wife
[01:15:41.600 --> 01:15:46.480]  look we must pay this can you please fix it with the bank she handles all my transactions no i
[01:15:46.480 --> 01:15:50.480]  understand there's always mistakes and no there was no mistakes on our part the bank didn't the
[01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:56.320]  bank got it wrong we instructed the bank uh the the instruction was made out properly the bank
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.520]  accepted the instruction it said it had made the payment my lovely wife who's very thorough about
[01:16:01.520 --> 01:16:05.920]  these things rang them the next day and said did you make the payment and they said yes
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:10.560]  and then it turned out that in fact they hadn't but the point is they're going over you with a
[01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:16.160]  fine tooth comb well yes and what these these creeps then did is they set up this hole in
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.720]  corner operation i in fact this is a rogue unit within the inner revenue it's called the cross
[01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:25.920]  cutting services unit these are the people and we are slowly encircling them we're going to get
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:30.560]  them eventually and some of their people are going to go to jail because they've been after me
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:35.680]  and some of my clients for years without the slightest justification and they're finally
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:41.040]  watching the records found one little thing and raced in like piranha yes all they found was
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:45.760]  that the tax that we thought we paid hadn't been paid and instead of checking with us and
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:49.680]  well what we said to the bank what happened to the monday and the bank has no i had a property
[01:16:49.680 --> 01:16:55.280]  tax thing where where the county deposited it but sent me notice they were going to start taking
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:17:00.080]  my property and i had to go get the check and go in and they don't apologize i had i had my
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:07.920]  registration sent to me misprinted uh wrong where it printed it off so i stuck the sticker on my
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:12.000]  car but there's no print get pulled over the cop goes that's a fraudulent sticker and i reached
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.480]  to my dog partner go this is how it was mailed by the state get printed it up here here it is you
[01:17:16.480 --> 01:17:20.560]  want me to put this piece of paper on the front of my car and the point is is the government is
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:25.360]  constantly making mistakes that's not this was not just a mistake this was a deliberate attempt
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:33.200]  no i know you to obtain uh information from me by deception it was a criminal offense so
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:40.240]  dr paul mccallum if i have got you wrong in this respect then i'm going to say this to you
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:46.160]  i will apologize i'll come back on this show and apologize to you so you have the chance now to get
[01:17:46.160 --> 01:17:51.040]  in touch with me and say you've completely misunderstood me i was being genuine and you've
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:57.120]  you've got me wrong if that is the case you get in touch with me i will get in touch with alex
[01:17:57.120 --> 01:18:03.520]  jones and alex will give me the freedom i'm sure you're sure to say okay i eat crow i got it wrong
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:11.040]  but i don't think dr paul mccallum that i did get it wrong i think you were an inland revenue spy
[01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:17.920]  and if you think that that is going to encourage me or anyone else to think well of the indian
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:23.840]  revenue you can think again you have come up against me several times on behalf of my clients
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:30.640]  every time you have been beaten twice in court in the most humiliating circumstances just leave
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:37.520]  us alone get off our case we will pay our taxes we will do it sensibly correctly and without any
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:42.800]  attempt at avoidance or evasion but we will not have this christmas game we will not have this
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:50.400]  spying enough is enough the people are fed up with this now this links in you see alex to the
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:56.960]  overall theme of this broadcast which is that the governing class is out of control they've approached
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:02.640]  all the dentists that my dad talks to to be homeland security spies on their patients
[01:19:02.640 --> 01:19:07.520]  they're setting up a spy network here that makes east germany look like a wonderland of freedom
[01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:13.840]  yeah that's right and this has got to stop and so i'm very very very tired of all this because
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:19.360]  they're always coming after the likes of me mainly because i dare to speak out and i say the EU
[01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:24.640]  is a dictatorship i say that the euro is a mickey mouse currency well hey we can all see that now
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:29.600]  but i was saying it years ago i was saying it in 1996 before they'd started it that this was going
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:35.040]  to happen i gave a detailed lecture i know it's on your website stay there i want to we've got to
[01:19:35.040 --> 01:19:39.280]  get to the euro what's happening with the euro what do you see coming what is it and then we've
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:45.440]  got a segue into the latest environmental fraud the green police the two thousand dollar day

[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:29.280]  shut down industry to raise taxes because the elites are all basically exempt they can commit
[01:24:29.280 --> 01:24:35.600]  whatever crime they want the head of facebook can you know publicly uh you know scam with his stock
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:39.680]  while he's selling it out the back door he probably won't get in trouble because because
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:44.640]  they're the insiders and they're waging war against us and if you look at the transformation of europe
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:51.600]  into what looks like the old soviet union the banning of crucifix all of this the going after
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:57.120]  property the banning of space heaters the it's all little knickknacks at first where they set the
[01:24:57.120 --> 01:25:03.760]  precedent they're in charge and the treatment with contempt of the citizen by the bureaucracy like
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:10.400]  these revenue spies these secret police these people who think they can behave just how they like
[01:25:10.400 --> 01:25:15.120]  without anyone oh the tsa here a lot of times will treat you like absolute scum on purpose
[01:25:15.120 --> 01:25:20.480]  so so so break down in this brief segment long segment coming up the tyranny of the EU and how
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:25.360]  80 percent of your laws are made by them right this is an official german government estimate
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:33.120]  two or three years ago that 83 five-sixths of all laws made for us in the united kingdom and
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:39.680]  indeed throughout the european dictatorship are now made by the 30 commissars that's the official
[01:25:39.680 --> 01:25:45.360]  german name for them the commissioners who run the european union you know the european parliament
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:50.640]  doesn't even have the right to bring forward a bill only the commissars can do that the european
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:56.160]  parliament can vote on that bill but its vote doesn't matter it can be overruled by the commission
[01:25:56.160 --> 01:26:00.240]  which also has the right to circumvent the parliament all together and make a thing called a commission
[01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:09.760]  regulation directly now the EU's advisors were at the cancun climate conference a couple of years
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:17.360]  ago i met some of them there they were advising the UN on how it too could grab power from democratic
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:22.640]  nations like the united states in the same way that the EU by stealth over a period of 20 or 30
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:28.000]  years had grabbed enormous amounts of power very nearly all power now of making laws and imposing
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:35.280]  taxes from the individual states of the european union and clearly the UN now says we want some
[01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.720]  of this we want the chance to be a world government and have the powers of taxation over the whole
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:46.480]  globe can you imagine given how powerful even the EU is just with a little old europe imagine
[01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:52.160]  Trent lot is now supporting that law of the sea where the UN will be 10 miles out everywhere
[01:26:52.160 --> 01:26:56.800]  taxing you to go fishing or go out in the ocean that's it the hellish UN will now be off the
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:27:01.440]  coast of the US that's it in the trouble with every time you met you sign a treaty like the law of
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:07.840]  the sea treaty your transferring power from elected hands in your country to unelected hands
[01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:12.480]  somewhere else my god if we can't get homeland security off our back imagine the UN and and
[01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:16.240]  what about the UN it's even in the new york times but they say oh but it's kind of good
[01:27:16.800 --> 01:27:22.080]  killing people in africa and latin america for the land to make it carbon sink zones yeah i mean
[01:27:22.080 --> 01:27:27.600]  this is the that's what i'm saying they're so over the top murderous but because they wear
[01:27:27.600 --> 01:27:32.240]  blue helmets and miss america says they love kids we're supposed to roll over to them that's right
[01:27:32.240 --> 01:27:37.040]  and the thing to do is to do what i do i've told you a couple of stories now about how the ordinary
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:42.720]  citizen when they try to come after him can fight back you know the secret police were amazed
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:47.520]  when they got a call from magistrate's court saying your summon to appear to answer a very serious
[01:27:47.520 --> 01:27:57.120]  charge of conspiracy to commit you know a crime of willful misfeasants in a public office they
[01:27:57.120 --> 01:28:02.880]  were astonished they weren't used to having it done to them and you can bet that the in and revenue
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:09.600]  isn't used to having the names identities and front shell companies of its spies exposed all
[01:28:09.600 --> 01:28:16.400]  over international television this is how one can fight back against these people because
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.040]  there's also good people in government sending us stuff now absolutely this is more and more
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:27.760]  going to happen because it's now got to the point where the governing class worldwide has
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:35.040]  studied the EU has seen how powerful the EU has become in its territory and it says you know if
[01:28:35.040 --> 01:28:40.160]  we could do this globally we could really have world domination and you you may only and they
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:45.040]  say that and then nowhere to run and that's it just like californians are running to texas there'd
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:49.920]  be nowhere to run oh that's the point what are we going to do go to the moon or mars no it's not
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:55.760]  going to be so easy and so this is what they're trying to do and we have to stop them and you're
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:29:00.160]  doing a wonderful work here alex in trying to stop and and you know sometimes people say oh
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:05.040]  alex jones he's a bit extreme well i can tell you this nothing like as extreme as what they're
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:10.800]  trying to do to us and so you're quite right that's the point they're so authoritarian and it's naked
[01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:15.920]  and i'm just desperate to warn people that's the thing people need to be i mean here am i
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:20.800]  a peer of the realm for heaven's sake and they think they can play these silly games on me they
[01:29:20.800 --> 01:29:25.360]  swat team members of the parliament that investigate them that's the thing and they you know they i mean
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:29.120]  let me tell you if i was a member of parliament investigating them they swat team to me yeah i'd
[01:29:29.120 --> 01:29:34.080]  be in their face listen you little crook you're in trouble instead of everyone like a you know a dog
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:38.960]  you know rolling over yeah and actually i think we're going to have to bring our secret police to
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:44.000]  an end i will be writing to our finance minister the charge of the checker who's in charge of the
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:49.120]  indian revenue he's on trouble to power on for it and say look you know this is one time too many

[01:34:33.120 --> 01:34:37.760]  sub police they have run over and will always jab and demand to see his papers and he's very
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:43.680]  clean-cut and nice and and again same thing here good-looking woman tsa attacks it's like literally
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:49.520]  living in a dictatorship uh lord mongton finishing up on that and then give us a brief overview uh
[01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:55.840]  on the latest attacks what the uh greenie meanies are up to the next stage of course is the rio plus
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:35:04.320]  20 conference in reared at an arrow 20 years after the earth summit of 1992 which started
[01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:10.880]  so much of this rubbish going on and the new theme they tried global warming then it stopped
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:14.560]  warming so they called it climate change and it stopped changing so they called it climate
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:19.680]  disruption then it wasn't disrupting of enough then they tried calling it energy security
[01:35:19.680 --> 01:35:25.280]  now the latest phrase is sustainable development and what you notice with each of these phrases is
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:32.160]  that it's they're all attacks on the west by the rest of the world or by particularly the
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:37.600]  communist factions even within the west who do not want capitalism and prosperity and freedom
[01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:46.480]  and democracy to succeed and the main thrust of the draft conclusions of this uh conference which
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:54.400]  is it's already in draft i've already seen it is that western countries must be made to pay the cost
[01:35:54.400 --> 01:35:59.680]  of the environmental disruption they are supposed to have called you said that in in in durbin a
[01:35:59.680 --> 01:36:04.160]  few months six months ago or so but then everything you said in the document that you got leaked
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:10.800]  they started announcing it well what happened then was that the i got the document and what i did there
[01:36:11.680 --> 01:36:16.240]  was when i got the final version of the document i actually had to parachute in
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:21.200]  to the conference because they tried to ban me from it the un tried oh yeah that's no joke you
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:25.440]  actually i actually they beat you up they've arrested you at other conferences i forgot you
[01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:31.040]  actually did parachute in from a height of 10 000 feet you're not joking and and and guys search that
[01:36:31.040 --> 01:36:35.280]  mounted parachutes into un pictures of that me grinning like a you know from year to year as i
[01:36:35.280 --> 01:36:40.000]  jump out of this plane at ten thousand been never done it before all since they're not going to stop
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:45.040]  you are they and so i got in because the publicity was huge of course and they they couldn't then get
[01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:49.280]  away with with keeping me out i also said that i would take them to court if there's any more
[01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:54.960]  nonsense and so they backed off and said okay okay we accept you are something else and and so i got
[01:36:54.960 --> 01:37:01.440]  in and i got a copy of the final negotiating text which was available to you know you'd not be clever
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:06.160]  it was available if you asked for it now because the world's press was there not one of them reported
[01:37:06.160 --> 01:37:13.040]  this document even existed let alone what was in it so i put in a blog posting at what's up with that
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:19.120]  which is the the great climate blog for those who are doubtful about whether this scare is really
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:26.400]  as strong as the usual suspects believe and i put up a posting that just said this Durban conference
[01:37:26.400 --> 01:37:31.840]  is proposing to set up an international criminal climate court which only people from western
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:36.720]  countries could be taken before it was going to give rights of legal personalities and mother earth
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:40.960]  i mean bonkers and they've since announced they are doing that and what they've done actually is
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:46.160]  they they dropped all these proposals within 24 hours of this blog posting going up because they
[01:37:46.160 --> 01:37:50.640]  was so embarrassed no no i mean i remember that that they dropped it and said oh that's preposterous
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:54.880]  and tried to even imply it wasn't true but now they're back i saw in the news saying we do need
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:38:00.320]  to arrest the climate criminals in fact they want to arrest people that deny paying al gore money will
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:06.160]  save us that's right they they do indeed and i've i've there's been this continuous sort of moan
[01:38:06.160 --> 01:38:11.520]  from the very extreme marxist left about how the likes of me ought to be taken to well more and more
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:16.000]  they're saying let's be authoritarian what do they make of the guy penn state university this is
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:24.640]  breaking news again they've just had a conference on how to silence the climate deniers oh and
[01:38:24.640 --> 01:38:29.680]  michael man of course the fabricator of the hockey stick bogus graph abolishing the medieval
[01:38:29.680 --> 01:38:35.120]  warm period suggesting that today was warmer than it was in 1500 all of this sort of thing
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:42.880]  he was he was there and i was named as being one of the serious deniers and the person organizing
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:48.320]  this said that he thought that a conversation should be held about declaring climate denial
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:53.120]  to be a crime against humanity now crimes against humanity are punishable by death
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:58.080]  and it was so forget just to re-education camp they want to kill us and it was james
[01:38:58.080 --> 01:39:04.000]  hanson of nasa who first suggested that as far as i can discover that it should be treated
[01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:08.560]  is that anyone who questions this climate story should be regarded as somebody who want to be
[01:39:08.560 --> 01:39:15.440]  executed for a crime against humanity now of course this is how far they this is how desperate
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:21.040]  but because they have the the the the cover-up of the long hair and the sandals and tie-dye shirts
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:26.560]  we think they're non-threatening so if you're thinking of giving money to penn state university
[01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:31.680]  or sending your kid there to be educated don't the well don't you want to get educated about
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:37.920]  jerry sandowski these people are totalitarians they ought not to be given any encouragement or
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:45.040]  money of any kind penn state university believes in executing the likes of me for alleged crimes
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:49.840]  against humanity don't give them any oxygen don't give them your children and don't give them your
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:54.480]  money and not to mention what they do to kids in showers well we won't go into that that's not for
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:00.000]  me to comment obviously but on this penn state university attempt to say that the likes of me
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:06.720]  should be executed for treason against the planet crime against humanity the way they put it it's
[01:40:06.720 --> 01:40:11.200]  all quite subtle they don't say monkton's gonna have to be executed they they mentioned my name
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:16.880]  as part of this thing and no but actually i have seen them say we need green fascism now now now
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:22.480]  now what do they make of the guy that came up with a gaya theory they're they're they're king
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:28.160]  over there it's like love coming out and saying and reversing himself well they of course furious
[01:40:28.160 --> 01:40:32.880]  with him and now they're attacking him and saying that he ought to be done for crimes against humanity
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:38.080]  because he has dared to betray the trust they had put in him as the author of this actually rather
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:42.640]  half but he's saying it's become a distraction from real environmental issues well that of course
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:48.320]  is absolutely correct uh those of us who believe in looking after the planet's environment properly
[01:40:49.360 --> 01:40:55.440]  don't want all the money diverted away from stopping deforestation to goldman sex away from
[01:40:55.440 --> 01:41:00.080]  to goldman sex to run this carbon trading worldwide it's not just Coleman sex because it was
[01:41:00.080 --> 01:41:04.560]  Lehman brothers they were right into this with Al Gore on the board and they went under because
[01:41:04.560 --> 01:41:09.760]  there i was off the ball i'm so busy posturing about climate and trying to corner the market which
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:14.720]  they hope would be a global one in in the right to trade carbon they were shooting the moon they
[01:41:14.720 --> 01:41:19.840]  were going for everything and they went under and and that is what has happened that chicago climate
[01:41:19.840 --> 01:41:24.720]  exchange collapsed last year when the that's my next question they're collapsing on every front
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:30.960]  but they're only viciously more attacking how big a deal is it that their entire program is now
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:34.560]  being revealed to me what do you expect them to do because they're still flailing around that's the
[01:41:34.560 --> 01:41:40.320]  thing when they start getting really extreme and they start really screeching like this you know
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:47.040]  they've lost one of my first battles with the in and revenue in the uk they wrote over a year a
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:51.280]  series of letters saying we want you to come for interview under caution about your tax affairs
[01:41:51.280 --> 01:41:56.160]  and those of your clients and i said fine just tell me what criminal offence you think i've
[01:41:56.160 --> 01:42:00.960]  committed not just the legal characterization but the factual particulars i am entitled
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:06.240]  under the european human rights convention to be told before i agree to be interviewed you tell me
[01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:12.640]  i'll come you don't tell me i won't come and they spent a year writing more and more vicious
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:17.760]  letters and in the end they wrote one so vicious that my my lovely wife who opened it burst into
[01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:22.240]  tears because she's a very sensitive last very sweet last my lovely wife and she burst into
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:26.960]  yes she was horrified at what they were saying about me and she rang me up because i was actually
[01:42:26.960 --> 01:42:32.400]  in cyprus at the time and she was in scotland and she said i've just had this really terrible
[01:42:32.400 --> 01:42:38.400]  letter floods of tears over the phone um what do we do about it i said we don't even need to reply
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:42.800]  she said what do you mean i said that is their instrument of capitulation the more savage they
[01:42:42.800 --> 01:42:50.480]  become the more they know they've lost and all these this governing class has made two huge
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:55.600]  mistakes which are now visible to everybody the first was the euro which was constructed along
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:43:01.040]  lines which were bound to fail i predicted in detail how and when and why it would fail and
[01:43:01.040 --> 01:43:04.640]  it's all come to pass exactly as it wasn't difficult to work out that's what i want you to do look
[01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:08.640]  more into your crystal ball give us the other points the other is the is the global warming thing
[01:43:08.640 --> 01:43:13.760]  which the entire governing class bet the farm on this particularly on the left but you got you've
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:18.480]  got wishy washy sent to right parties like the conservatives in the uk going along with it but
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:24.400]  the real enthusiasm for it was always on the hard left and it is wrong and everybody now knows
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:29.280]  it's wrong there was no a saying if you get 15 years without global warming the models were
[01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:34.320]  wrong we've had 15 years without global warming it's over the scare is over the results are in
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:40.960]  and the truth is out and the scare is over and what has happened is that the the governing
[01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:47.280]  class which likes to present itself as omniscient and omnipotent and invincible and invincible
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:53.280]  and invincible exactly they are now shown to have got feet of clay they're shown to have got yes
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:44:00.960]  wrong and because people can see that they've got things wrong it is that cynicism now on the
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:05.520]  part of it's a collapse of credibility which is this complete collapse of credibility which
[01:44:05.520 --> 01:44:11.520]  i think may yet save democracy well that's what i was about to say people have this idea especially
[01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:15.920]  from the churches that have been world council of churches paid off that it's the end of the world
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:21.520]  you can't fight evil that's the way it is history's the opposite when good men fight evil all we have
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:26.160]  is victory sure we're going to lose the battles are going to be hard but those that persevere
[01:44:26.160 --> 01:44:32.560]  win we can route these people and every time we engage them in the info war their death stars
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:38.160]  blow into a trillion pieces so what are the new targets because i'm ready to attack right well
[01:44:38.160 --> 01:44:43.200]  i think what we do now is we press home our advantage on the EU the only future for the for
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:49.360]  the EU now both as a currency and as a political entity is disintegration it's no longer possible
[01:44:49.360 --> 01:44:55.440]  or right to keep this together the peoples of europe want out if you had a vote in britain now 6040
[01:44:55.440 --> 01:44:59.040]  we would vote to come out of the so it's going to disintegrate like the syria union that'll
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:06.400]  disintegrate what we've got to make sure is that at the uh rio conference where the milk and water
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:11.280]  current draft of the conclusions of the conference will be replaced by something much more extreme
[01:45:11.920 --> 01:45:18.400]  we do not we do not let our government get away with that now alex i'll do a deal with you here
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:24.720]  i will go to rio i will get a copy of the final draft when it comes out and before it is finalized
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:32.080]  in negotiation i will tell you what's in it and then if what is in it is in any way unsuitable
[01:45:32.080 --> 01:45:37.200]  you get on the air tell people what's in it and make absolutely sure that they get in touch with
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:43.040]  their senator and their congressman and with the white house and say we will not have our democracy
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:49.520]  taken away we will not have our powers and our wealth transferred to the un in the name of sustainable
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:55.760]  economic development or environmental development when in fact we are perfectly capable as a nation
[01:45:55.760 --> 01:46:00.480]  of regulating our own affairs and we do not need these people particularly if they're not elected
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:05.600]  by us yes how we should run our affairs shows the central point the central point here is
[01:46:06.560 --> 01:46:13.120]  that if we just take out this constitution again i do that and if i just cite article one section
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:20.400]  one all legislative power here in granted shall be vested in a congress of the united states
[01:46:20.400 --> 01:46:28.400]  which shall consist of a congress of a senate and house of representatives period all power
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:34.000]  to make laws for you or give taxes to you or impose taxes on you those powers should be in
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:39.680]  the hands of people whom you elect and it's the same thing with the house of commons and lords
[01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:44.960]  but the bureaucracy purpose they've stolen it the commons and lords gave it away i remember
[01:46:44.960 --> 01:46:50.400]  having a big row with my father about this when the treaty of mass strict came up for voting
[01:46:50.400 --> 01:46:55.920]  that was a treaty which finally gave away britain sovereignty and gave away our democracy but any
[01:46:55.920 --> 01:47:00.880]  treaty that's a fraud can be null and void it's time to tear it up and i said to him yeah i said
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:07.040]  to him don't vote for this well he wanted to vote for this but in fact i was so angry his vote was
[01:47:07.040 --> 01:47:14.560]  discounted and even so that by a huge majority the house of lords also voted to hand britain's
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:21.120]  democracy away and this was a disgraceful betrayal and i want to reverse this now we
[01:47:21.120 --> 01:47:27.680]  have got to start saying to the governing class of the world we will not be bullied we will not
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:33.520]  have our democracy taken away if you want to set up international institutions then they must be
[01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:39.600]  elected by all the peoples of the countries who constitute those institutions we will not
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:45.920]  transfer any more powers by treaty to any international organization that is not elected
[01:47:45.920 --> 01:47:53.440]  it's a simple enough rule it's monkton's rule that in future no more mr nice guy we do not give up
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:48:02.080]  our powers of our congress that are voted for by us to anyone else overseas unless that institution
[01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:06.960]  is elected by our people as well as the peoples of the and here here to that but let me bring up
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:12.320]  some examples yeah congress stopped declaring war in the 50s but they still gave their authorization
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:18.640]  and you just read out of the constitution now obama has said i don't get any authorization
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:23.120]  from you even though they fund it and are supposed to yeah but he went one further he said the un
[01:48:23.120 --> 01:48:28.640]  gives me the orders in a public letter and statements yeah i mean that is treason i mean that is not
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:32.720]  just the president saying i'm julia caesar that's that's bad enough but at least it was a roman being
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:39.360]  a dictator this is saying i am an agent of the un yes i mean that is beyond and and this is what
[01:48:39.360 --> 01:48:45.440]  we've come to and i think the only future for the un is the two two ways it can go it can be elected
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:52.160]  or it must be disbanded the un has long outlived what little usefulness it had it now simply sucks
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:59.200]  in money to itself only one cent on the dollar is paid out but it murders people everywhere
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:03.520]  exactly it lines them up and shoots them to take their land and i got liberals coming to my door
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:08.640]  saying give money for unicef and i'm like the un murders them the un wants to turn their power off
[01:49:08.640 --> 01:49:12.480]  well unfortunately this actually happened in uganda of course i mean you may think that
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:17.520]  alex is being extreme merely because he shouts down the microphone but unfortunately he's outraged
[01:49:17.520 --> 01:49:22.800]  it happened in honduras actually happened in honduras it happened in uganda and all sorts of
[01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:29.280]  unspeakable crimes are now being committed in the name of the un and really at its instigator and
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:33.520]  for the earth i mean they say we're this is this is a storyline of course but what is really going
[01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:40.720]  on here is that those who like the idea that they should rule from the center and that we the people
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:45.360]  ought not to have any say in the matter because we don't care enough about these things or don't
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:51.200]  know enough about these things they want to stitch us up with a world government if they can and when
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:56.720]  i first mentioned this people said oh well monkton is just a conspiracy theorist so i said right go
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:50:02.640]  and read you can get it now still on the un website i don't think they've taken it down yet uh annex one
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:10.560]  paragraph 36 and 38 of the copenhagen treaty draft of the 15th of september 2009 where you will find
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:15.760]  in both of those paragraphs the word government mentioned in a context which is clearly that of
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:21.920]  world government and then read the rest of that treaty and you'll see it was essentially the
[01:50:21.920 --> 01:50:26.320]  bureaucratic structure for this world government that this treaty was setting out in 186 pages
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:32.160]  and then tell me there was and well the financial times of london a world government newsweek they
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:36.080]  all come out and say world government's the answer that's right this is this is the growing trend
[01:50:36.080 --> 01:50:41.440]  and it's all being manipulated and the the the thing that we the people should do is to say
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:47.680]  fine if there's to be a world government we elect it if we don't elect it then we give it no powers
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:52.160]  we'll be right back lord mongton with phone calls straight ahead lorkas from mongton

[01:54:59.040 --> 01:55:04.640]  tax thing the global warming it's it's all and you it's i'm just wondering if there is any other
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:08.720]  targets they might be going after other than carbon to try to get whatever they're trying to push
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:13.120]  through with the global warming yes i think what they're going to do now is to take the
[01:55:13.120 --> 01:55:18.880]  environment as a whole as their big issue they've lost on carbon now they know that
[01:55:19.440 --> 01:55:23.200]  that of course they don't want to admit it because governments can never so they're going back to
[01:55:23.200 --> 01:55:27.360]  cave bugs and polar bears that can't swim that's right they'll be going back to that they'll be
[01:55:27.360 --> 01:55:32.800]  going back to the whole question that every time humans do anything they affect the environment
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:37.360]  around them well of course we do and they're effectively going to say what we need is massive
[01:55:37.360 --> 01:55:43.040]  d population and in particular a massive d industrial they've been saying and openly get rid of people
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:47.520]  kill children up to age three i mean what a group of loonies that's that's the thing we are dealing
[01:55:47.520 --> 01:55:53.280]  with uh extremists who hate the west this is the still the main motive they don't care about the
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:55:59.040]  environment uh john one of my great friends was a lovely man called eric ellington who was one of
[01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:04.400]  the founders of greenpeace and he like me and like you i think was a genuine environmentalist
[01:56:04.400 --> 01:56:08.800]  really concerned about the true environmental problems of the planet and he said within three
[01:56:08.800 --> 01:56:14.800]  years we all had to leave greenpeace because it was taken over by marxists and he said we were all
[01:56:14.800 --> 01:56:19.760]  non-political we didn't know how to stop them they took over our movement and they turned it into a
[01:56:19.760 --> 01:56:25.600]  political movement to destroy the west it ceased to be genuinely about the environment but you
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:29.360]  still get of course thousands of people giving money to greenpeace every year because they think
[01:56:29.360 --> 01:56:33.600]  it's about the environment when in fact what they're doing is furthering what used to be called
[01:56:33.600 --> 01:56:38.240]  marxism and now it's called absolutely let's go to another thank you john cj and michigan
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:45.440]  you're on the air with lord christopher montan hey greeting hello cj how are you doing uh yeah
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:51.280]  well i got a comment you remember alex they uh already were asking to burn down people's houses
[01:56:51.280 --> 01:56:55.600]  that were climate deniers oh that's right they've had all these professors and people come out and
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:57:01.440]  say arrest people ignore the republic ignore the right of the voters these professors uh and they
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:08.880]  said yes burn our houses down and indeed professor richard linson of mit who is perhaps the world's
[01:57:08.880 --> 01:57:14.160]  foremost atmospheric scientist he really understands how all this works and he says there's no problem
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:19.760]  with the climate caused by us he has had his house burnt down in circumstances which are
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:24.160]  clearly suspicious now of course we can't infer from that that this was climate extremism well we
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:29.360]  know they burned down houses and ski resorts and indeed it's it's quite a fashionable thing after
[01:57:29.360 --> 01:57:35.200]  all most of the people who signed the declaration of independence had their houses burnt down by
[01:57:35.200 --> 01:57:40.400]  british loyalists at the time so it is a kind of i would say a recognized method of protest and you
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:47.040]  certainly don't do this at home but it is a way in which extremists like to put their point
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:52.960]  and i think it's got to be firmly discussed all this talk about treating those who dare to question
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:58.480]  the scientific nonsense behind global warming as though they were some sort of serious criminals
[01:57:58.480 --> 01:58:02.960]  against humanity which as i say that's a sentence that's a sentence of death if you're if you're
[01:58:02.960 --> 01:58:07.440]  regarded as having committed a crime against humanity that kind of thing has got to be resisted
[01:58:07.440 --> 01:58:13.360]  we've got to say that this kind of thing will not pass we're not having it i agree and we've
[01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:17.280]  got to recognize the type of wild authoritarians we're talking about here i mean these really
[01:58:17.280 --> 01:58:21.920]  are bad people these are the crazy and when they're in control the entire government becomes
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:26.720]  something that is alien to the country that's right and we have to recognize just how bad it is
[01:58:26.720 --> 01:58:30.640]  and they've tried to dumb us down but the west has had so much freedom that the sleeping giant

[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:21.760]  he's alex jones on the gcm radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:28.400]  you know an hour and 20 minutes is just gone by way too quick with lord montan but max keiser's
[02:00:28.400 --> 02:00:32.320]  coming up it's going to be sad to see lord montan go we're going to serve him up some good texas
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:38.400]  barbecue though i'm looking forward to that uh the government minister that wants to ban crucifix
[02:00:38.400 --> 02:00:42.000]  in england and the eu's agreeing with him she looks like a witch i mean i don't go off how you
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:46.320]  look but i mean it's not just that she's older yeah my grandmother is very you know you know
[02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:51.120]  almost 90 but she's she but but she's a lovely lightener eyes this woman looks like central
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:57.040]  casting to be a witch guys show folks a document cam shot of that i mean it's just these people are
[02:00:57.040 --> 02:01:01.840]  monstrous and it's all about the raw exercise of power isn't it well yes bring back the ducking
[02:01:01.840 --> 02:01:08.880]  stools say i this woman really has gone far beyond what is common sense and she can do this
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:13.120]  because unfortunately our catholic bishops in england and wales unlike the ones in scotland
[02:01:13.120 --> 02:01:18.400]  and unlike the ones in america are soggy and useless the one in scotland we have a marvellous
[02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:23.440]  cardinal in scotland cardinal brian who speaks out he's a working class guy but he speaks out
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:27.680]  with terrific authority and the press respect him even when he's saying things that are deeply
[02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:33.120]  unfashionable whereas in england they just don't seem to have the same kind of muscular approach
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:37.760]  and they don't stand up for the church's teachings against the increasing encroachment
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:43.120]  of this all in well even if you're not a christian it's obvious that christianity is better than new
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:49.120]  world order socialism well i would certainly say that's the case and unfortunately the governing
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:54.160]  class has decided that christianity is uncongenial to it because it encourages people to think for
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:57.840]  themselves rather than becoming just like the borg i mean we're dealing with the borg here
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:04.320]  aren't they really that sort of uniform thinking all with a hive mentality like we are where are you
[02:02:04.320 --> 02:02:10.720]  speaking next so next i'm going to arizona to speak to several tea parties as a thing called
[02:02:10.720 --> 02:02:16.160]  a surprise tea party i'm speaking at that shortly a couple of speeches in arizona then i go back
[02:02:16.160 --> 02:02:21.760]  to the uk then i'm almost straight on to the next plane down to rio to try and throw a wrench in
[02:02:21.760 --> 02:02:24.800]  and we're going to be able to get you on from there yeah i've been happy to do that thank you
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:28.240]  let's jam in a few more calls christopher in california you're on the air with lord mongton
[02:02:28.240 --> 02:02:36.640]  hey how's it going lord mongton alex jones how are you hey how's it going i'm originally from
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:45.040]  you may rizana the thing is i had a couple of questions do you think it's true uh from what
[02:02:45.040 --> 02:02:50.240]  the books i've been reading from david ike saying that these groups are all right yeah now people
[02:02:50.240 --> 02:02:54.560]  like david ike you know saying that the elites are you know really really blood thirsty agendas
[02:02:54.560 --> 02:03:00.640]  yes david ike i think might have been a little bit cautious of he's he's slightly gone off the rails
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:06.640]  i think but yeah i think i think one one needs to be a nice guy though you can go about as far as
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:11.360]  alex jones going beyond alex jones you're out right into the into the darkness of complete who knows
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:15.280]  though that woman does look like she might be a reptoid lord mongton yes she does look as though
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:20.640]  she's come out of one of the star wars films as an extra so you think i'm one of the i'm like the
[02:03:20.640 --> 02:03:26.160]  outer limit like the final waypoint you're about as far as one can safely go before going out into
[02:03:26.160 --> 02:03:30.880]  the complete void once you once you cross that line it's like then you really it's like chore on the
[02:03:30.880 --> 02:03:36.000]  boatman says ah that's it you're beyond the pale coming back i'm like a pillar you reach that and
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:41.040]  the river sticks is right there thank you caller i can't do something else bob real fast in missouri
[02:03:41.040 --> 02:03:49.360]  go ahead yes lord mongton alex i was as you were talking i kept thinking of this a new right stack
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:56.480]  fire for the eu and the rise of a strong man it just kept coming up in my head as i was hearing you
[02:03:56.480 --> 02:04:01.200]  talk about the breakup of the eu i don't think the controllers are going to tolerate the breakup i
[02:04:01.200 --> 02:04:06.080]  think they're going to do some sort of a synthetic terror incident that's very sensible you're quite
[02:04:06.080 --> 02:04:10.480]  right they will i don't i don't know that they will literally go so far as to invent a terror
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:14.960]  incident i think they know that you know the likes of alex and the likes of me are watching and if
[02:04:14.960 --> 02:04:20.080]  they did that we really would come after them until we got them so no i don't think they'll do that
[02:04:20.080 --> 02:04:25.040]  what i do think is that they will certainly want to keep the power they've already got they won't
[02:04:25.040 --> 02:04:28.880]  want the eu to be dismantled because it makes them feel powerful it gives them enormous powers of
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:33.680]  taxation and regulation without any accountability to any electors that's what they want and we
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:38.320]  must make sure they don't get it well they definitely will try some tricks but look here
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:41.920]  you know what i want you to be able to say hi to max keiser we're going to come back in three minutes

[02:07:04.960 --> 02:07:09.040]  and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle did you know that in a real meltdown
[02:07:09.040 --> 02:07:13.600]  non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:18.240]  even gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen again so our
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:23.040]  friends at solutions from science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:28.960]  they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient dense food

[02:08:17.280 --> 02:08:21.760]  well we've had lord montan in here for the last hour and a half and i just wanted to have him be
[02:08:21.760 --> 02:08:28.320]  able to finish up any points that you were making you're going to be down at the 20th anniversary
[02:08:28.320 --> 02:08:32.960]  of morris strong and his post-industrial world going to be reporting on that for us when is that
[02:08:32.960 --> 02:08:39.440]  coming up that's coming up uh kind of mid-june in Rio de Janeiro and something like a hundred so-called
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:44.320]  world so-called leaders will be turning up and i will be there to throw a large wrench in the works
[02:08:45.360 --> 02:08:50.320]  all right and also you're going to be speaking next out in arizona can people find out more
[02:08:50.320 --> 02:08:55.120]  at scienceandpublicpolicy.org i'll i'll have to get back to you on that one i'll get you to put
[02:08:55.120 --> 02:09:00.560]  on the website because i'm not sure what who is covering that one from the absolutely in closing
[02:09:00.560 --> 02:09:05.440]  when do you expect the euro to break up it's already happening greece is on its way out i would
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:09.600]  think within weeks they'll have to make it well the idler spain next that goes on is next and you
[02:09:09.600 --> 02:09:14.880]  can tell this by looking at the amount of interest which governments have to pay in order to get people
[02:09:14.880 --> 02:09:19.680]  to lend money to them and spain is clearly now in the same territory that greece was in a few months

[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:19.440]  speak to you and your listeners yeah i've been following your show so i've noticed you've been
[02:11:19.440 --> 02:11:24.320]  on the road always great information uh what do you want to hit first jp morgan the latest on
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:29.280]  mf global uh this big scam i mean that's my view that well they admit he was selling the stock as
[02:11:29.280 --> 02:11:34.400]  he hyped it this week i mean is he gonna get jail time um um you don't get suckered you get
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:41.360]  suckered now uh the the uh EU gyrating wildly what do you want to hit first max keiser uh retired
[02:11:41.360 --> 02:11:49.360]  top stockbroker tv host uh extraordinaire on bbc rt uh algae zero you name it he does it uh there
[02:11:49.360 --> 02:11:56.160]  with his trusty sidekick uh what is first and center uh on your radar screen well i think
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:12:01.760]  if we need to talk about jp morgan because we've been talking about jp morgan on your show for a
[02:12:01.760 --> 02:12:07.040]  couple of years and what we've been saying is that the company is very vulnerable because their
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:15.120]  balance sheet is extraordinarily laden with toxic uh derivatives that completely unsustainable you've
[02:12:15.120 --> 02:12:19.200]  been predicting they were going to have a crisis and people laugh not the king of the hill not the
[02:12:19.200 --> 02:12:26.400]  top of the pyramid yeah exactly and so what we advise people was to attack their balance sheet
[02:12:27.120 --> 02:12:32.880]  we know that when they acquired uh bare sterns that they inherited a three billion ounce
[02:12:33.600 --> 02:12:40.000]  naked short position on silver and the fact is that last year people listening to your show got
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:44.880]  silver to double in price and now we see the results jp morgan announced a two billion dollar
[02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:50.960]  now it's a five billion dollars now talk about a 12 billion dollar loss on their balance sheet 20
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:56.960]  billion dollar loss in market capitalization that is a direct result of direct action by listeners
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:04.960]  buying silver because to cover that short they had to scrape borrow and steal from other pieces
[02:13:04.960 --> 02:13:09.360]  of their balance sheet they had to go all the way to london to get their trainer in london
[02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:16.400]  to start uh committing fraud uh to cover that hole and they got caught and this is just going to be
[02:13:16.400 --> 02:13:22.880]  now the the the fuse has been lit jp morgan is going the way of edlon it's going the way of all
[02:13:22.880 --> 02:13:30.480]  these banks that end up going completely bust the stock's going to zero now there's over a thousand
[02:13:30.480 --> 02:13:34.880]  trillion in admitted derivatives even the washington post admits that it's impossible to pay back it's
[02:13:34.880 --> 02:13:41.600]  not our debt over 90 of greece's debt iceland all of it ireland not their debt but jp morgan
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:46.080]  goldman saxon others were able to get their people in his ministers over finance but also
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:50.400]  as the president's prime ministers to sign everybody on to the debt but now i notice
[02:13:50.400 --> 02:13:56.960]  their burning banks uh in um in greece where you've been all over europe people know it's the
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:02.080]  banksters i'm even seeing hollywood movies talk about the banksters i saw a marky mark movie called
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:06.880]  the other guy's a comedy and it was all about you know golden sacks jp morgan ripping people off
[02:14:06.880 --> 02:14:10.880]  i mean it would even the power structure starts admitting it looks like they're getting ready
[02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:16.880]  to leave the sinking ship uh what do you expect to happen well people are beginning to figure out
[02:14:16.880 --> 02:14:22.560]  it's the bankers remember a few years ago 10 years ago they had the anti globalization movement
[02:14:22.560 --> 02:14:28.560]  they figured out that was too vague so they reinvented themselves as the occupy wall street
[02:14:28.560 --> 02:14:34.320]  movement which is still too vague but soon they will be figuring out it's the anti federal reserve
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:41.280]  bank anti janie diamond who sits on the new york fed and jp morgan's chairman's chairs movement
[02:14:41.280 --> 02:14:46.480]  so as they begin to get specific now about who the real criminals are then i would imagine that
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:55.360]  their actions would be also very direct and specific what's happening in europe right now
[02:14:55.360 --> 02:15:06.000]  well the banking situation is of course quite dire and they are attempting to deal with these
[02:15:06.000 --> 02:15:12.960]  massive bank runs so in greece just in the last week hundreds of billions of euros have been
[02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:20.320]  exiting greece uh we have bank deposits exiting spain right now uh a lot of that money is going
[02:15:20.320 --> 02:15:26.480]  to the dollar and the british pound and the german government bond and here's something
[02:15:26.480 --> 02:15:30.480]  interesting we've talked about it on your show before alexa now it looks like it's coming true
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:36.640]  we've talked about the possibility of banks issuing bonds and governments issuing bonds
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:42.400]  that pay a negative interest rate in other words you pay the bank to hold your money and this will
[02:15:42.400 --> 02:15:47.680]  be a viable option for people who are too frightened by the volatility they're too frightened by the
[02:15:47.680 --> 02:15:52.640]  street violence they're willing to give their money to the government to the banks and pay the
[02:15:52.640 --> 02:15:57.680]  government one or two percent a year or five percent a year and they'll take that loss because
[02:15:57.680 --> 02:16:02.880]  they think it's the only way to preserve whatever they have left that's what they are aiming for
[02:16:02.880 --> 02:16:08.160]  because of course they'd love to have that use of your money and not only not pay you any interest
[02:16:08.160 --> 02:16:11.520]  but have you pay them interest it's called indentured servitude
[02:16:11.520 --> 02:16:19.200]  good now obviously the banksters think 30 000 drones launching over the u.s with our taxpayer
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:26.880]  money is going to keep them safe but as brzezinski's even admitted once the oligarchy is identified
[02:16:26.880 --> 02:16:34.320]  and the puppets are exposed as puppets it's game over there's no way that once the people
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:38.480]  understand it's the bankers screwing everything up that they're going to get away with this so how
[02:16:38.480 --> 02:16:44.080]  do you see this shaking out as everything we've predicted you've predicted all our guests have
[02:16:44.080 --> 02:16:51.040]  said you know euro but imploding the next the u.s the u.s is in worse financial situation but it's
[02:16:51.040 --> 02:16:55.120]  economic warfare i mean the globalists say world government's going to be the answer
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:16:58.400]  run by the very bankers that engineered this how are they going to get away with this
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:04.240]  they'll offer safe harbor to people who are willing to give up everything to live on the the right
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:10.000]  side of the castle wall as you see a return to feudalism and lords and serfs and a complete
[02:17:10.000 --> 02:17:14.720]  evisceration of the middle class now let's look at something that was in the economist magazine
[02:17:14.720 --> 02:17:20.960]  this past week page 79 they talk openly about the fact that goldman sacks another bank we've
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:27.760]  talked about on your show often was engaged in due to this is only made public because of a mistake
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:33.920]  made by a lawyer at the firm they got the documents it shows clearly that goldman sacks was engaged
[02:17:33.920 --> 02:17:39.040]  in something called naked short selling they sell stock in this case a company called overstock
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:44.800]  com they sell stock that never existed which is the exact same thing as counterfeiting and
[02:17:44.800 --> 02:17:49.760]  something i've said many times in al dazira which they never had me back on after i told them about
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:56.080]  naked short selling and counterfeiting when i mentioned this on my film for al dazira english
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:01.840]  called money geyser and other films about naked short selling my my entry in wikipedia was taken
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:06.800]  down for a year because of the forces that were trying to keep a lid on the scandal of naked
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:12.240]  short selling now because of a mistake made by a lawyer it's on page 79 of the economist it should
[02:18:12.240 --> 02:18:17.840]  be on page one because you would think counterfeiting would be the most heinous of all crimes in
[02:18:17.840 --> 02:18:23.120]  an economy that consider themselves to be capitalist but they admitted that they were in
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:29.040]  fact engaged in outright counterfeiting this is the same thing the nazis did to try to destabilize
[02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:34.720]  britain during world war two the same thing that you saw in a civil war in america uh once
[02:18:34.720 --> 02:18:40.240]  one government starts to counterfeit money you know that what the remaining paper money
[02:18:40.240 --> 02:18:47.200]  is completely and utterly worthless only keep money in paper money alex that you're willing
[02:18:47.200 --> 02:18:56.160]  to lose and that's now bringing us to the runs on the bank spreading from greece to spain i mean
[02:18:56.160 --> 02:19:01.440]  it's all starting to unfold what's the timetable max well you're right they're they're going from
[02:19:01.440 --> 02:19:06.240]  out of the out of the frying pan into the fire so they go from greece to spain then they want to
[02:19:06.240 --> 02:19:12.080]  go to germany they hope to go to the uk but it's uh you know it's like an agate the christy novel
[02:19:12.080 --> 02:19:18.000]  where every every chapter some new some new character in the book dies gets murdered and
[02:19:18.000 --> 02:19:22.160]  they're wondering who who's the who's the number one killer of all this well the number one killer
[02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:27.040]  of all this is a federal reserve bank and jamie diamond and the federal reserve bank in new york
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:30.800]  they're the you just skip to the end chapter you don't need to read the whole book they're the
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:37.440]  epicenter there's jamie diamond he's a bad guy uh he's trying to hoodwink the world into accepting
[02:19:37.440 --> 02:19:43.840]  fake phony counterfeit money and his nonsensical stock and that's where uh we need to go directly
[02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:49.120]  and protect oneself against that uh and to do what we've been saying on your show for three or four
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:57.520]  years now uh by golden silver well said i want to come back and look at the zuckerberg situation

[02:24:53.520 --> 02:25:00.400]  planet info wars dot com planet info wars dot com the merger of info wars dot com and
[02:25:00.400 --> 02:25:11.600]  prison planet dot com now going back to max keiser for me this just i mean it's the culture of mf
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:15.600]  global and jp morgan saying you're dead if you don't give us that money so they take it out of
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:21.840]  private accounts now you've got the head of facebook calling his users dumb efforts it's all got
[02:25:21.840 --> 02:25:27.120]  cia people involved founding it explain to people as a former top you'll now retired stockbroker
[02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:31.040]  media person investigative journalists you know wearing all the hats what happened there i mean
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:36.400]  i'm not a big stock guy i mean i don't own any but i'm forced to study it constantly i'm not in
[02:25:36.400 --> 02:25:40.480]  paper put it to you that way i mean and i mean i invest here in the in my media operation to get
[02:25:40.480 --> 02:25:45.120]  the word out that's what i care about his hearts and minds and liberty for a future i i want to
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:49.280]  win the future as obama says i don't want their tyrants to win the future i'm fighting for the
[02:25:49.280 --> 02:25:55.040]  future as you are but max they come out with this giant hundred billion dollar deal the analysts
[02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:59.280]  say it's not worth anywhere near that because it's an advertising thing it's not like google or apple
[02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:03.200]  that actually have something i'm not saying they're good companies with suicide nets at their factories
[02:26:03.200 --> 02:26:07.920]  at foxcom you know for apple my point is that there's something real there even though al gore's on
[02:26:07.920 --> 02:26:13.360]  the board with this it doesn't look good comes out they claim there's a glitch so that that's their
[02:26:13.360 --> 02:26:18.240]  excuse for it to go down now it's down massively go over the numbers for us on that and now it's
[02:26:18.240 --> 02:26:26.000]  confirmed by the associated press and others that zuckerberg says that or zuckered says well
[02:26:26.000 --> 02:26:32.240]  that he was shelling day one now martha steward went to jail for nothing uh and and they went after
[02:26:32.240 --> 02:26:37.040]  you know the owner of the dallas mavericks for nothing uh don't they have to go after him now
[02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:43.040]  or is he too big to fail well it's a classic uh what they call on wall street pump and dump
[02:26:43.040 --> 02:26:50.320]  you know if you do a little search on a firm on wall street called dh blair which was very active
[02:26:50.320 --> 02:26:57.680]  20 years ago bringing to market fake companies or companies over hyped and as the day approaches
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:03.440]  when the company goes public the insiders are selling out of their stock and then the retail
[02:27:03.440 --> 02:27:10.640]  investors get dumped what's remarkable about the facebook pump and dump is that that barric
[02:27:10.640 --> 02:27:17.040]  obama was hyping the stock just a few months ago they had zuckerberg at the white house he went
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:22.080]  they're asking to promote his candidacy on facebook uh so he had the president of the
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:28.640]  united states pumping and dumping an ipo which is a new thing in the history of america no president
[02:27:28.640 --> 02:27:34.720]  has ever pumped and dumped an ipo like obama pumped and dumped facebook uh so they stock goes public
[02:27:34.720 --> 02:27:40.560]  at 100 billion dollars a share and the insiders had already sold out there's a thing on the internet
[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:46.480]  called second market which allows insiders to sell out their stock on the way up they sold out
[02:27:46.480 --> 02:27:51.520]  billions on the way up and don't forget that when goldman sacks got involved when the company was
[02:27:51.520 --> 02:27:59.200]  worth 50 billion and they took a position uh they violated sec law by offering stock to more than what
[02:27:59.200 --> 02:28:06.800]  the fci sec allows by law number of clients to own the stock but their response to that was to get
[02:28:06.800 --> 02:28:13.120]  the sec to change the law so once again we see that wall street makes the law wall street administers
[02:28:13.120 --> 02:28:19.680]  the law wall street adjudicates the laws and if you ever sue wall street you go to a arbitration
[02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:25.520]  panel that's staffed by people from wall street so it's a fantastic place to steal money there's no
[02:28:25.520 --> 02:28:30.880]  uh inhibitors to stealing money there's no laws that apply to anyone working there nobody ever goes
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:35.920]  to jail if any of your listeners want to become a cabillionaire a zillionaire a millionaire get
[02:28:35.920 --> 02:28:41.440]  your series seven broker license get in you know pick up a telephone and you can break the law with
[02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:47.600]  impunity just like zuckerberg and barack obama and the whole crew if you're part of one of the few
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:53.040]  big firms if you're a smaller firm and go on tv and promote a stock you think's good they claim
[02:28:53.040 --> 02:28:56.880]  that you're pumping and dumping and arrest you or if you sell a you know a few hundred thousand
[02:28:56.880 --> 02:29:01.360]  dollars worth of some stock you own uh if you're the owner of the dallas mavericks they go after
[02:29:01.360 --> 02:29:06.800]  because it's publicity they know people know your name uh mark cuban and so it sounds like or if
[02:29:06.800 --> 02:29:10.960]  you're willy nelson and they claim you're on your back taxes they take his house away for nothing but
[02:29:10.960 --> 02:29:15.520]  if you want to steal billions it's okay if you want to steal the police pension fund it's great and
[02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:20.400]  the cops will even beat the anti wall street protesters in the head for fun because they don't
[02:29:20.400 --> 02:29:26.160]  know which end is up i mean it is absolutely insane we're going to come back long segment with max

[02:33:14.560 --> 02:33:20.720]  mandatory internet id for europe they're announcing 30 000 drones here total surveillance head of the
[02:33:20.720 --> 02:33:24.720]  cia says yeah we're operating domestically listening and watching everything you do
[02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:29.120]  there's an attempt to intimidate people see the globalists think americans and europeans for that
[02:33:29.120 --> 02:33:36.320]  matter are like cowardly no people are so self-absorbed and lazy because we've had so much liberty
[02:33:36.320 --> 02:33:41.760]  that they're not paying attention as they begin to have their resources turned off as people begin
[02:33:41.760 --> 02:33:47.280]  to get awake it's over folks that's the way it always is as people start pushing folks around
[02:33:47.280 --> 02:33:53.600]  it's over you think we're scared of you no most people are busy trying to take care of their families
[02:33:53.600 --> 02:33:57.600]  but as they realize how real all this is people are getting out of their comfort zone
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:03.520]  and the new water better look out here it is while the international uh acta treaty in united
[02:34:03.520 --> 02:34:08.160]  states syspa legislation is setting the stage to clamp down on the worldwide web technocrats
[02:34:08.160 --> 02:34:13.200]  are working overtime to try to pit now pin down your identity and make sure all your
[02:34:13.200 --> 02:34:17.280]  activities are thoroughly monitored and under control it's about an internet tax folks is the
[02:34:17.280 --> 02:34:22.720]  real reason the european union is now moving to create a mandatory electronic id system
[02:34:22.720 --> 02:34:28.560]  for all EU citizens that would be implemented across europe to standardize businesses both online
[02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:34.000]  and in person and again this is just hellish this is for global tracking and taxes and to ban your
[02:34:34.000 --> 02:34:39.120]  id like they said in syspa another before they cut it out that that three strikes your band off the
[02:34:39.120 --> 02:34:44.400]  internet forever that's like the tsa says you can't fly because they're god no judge no jury then
[02:34:44.400 --> 02:34:49.360]  there's a no gun by list it's all about this arbitrary you can't travel you can't leave the
[02:34:49.360 --> 02:34:54.640]  country because the irs says so these are capital controls max you've talked a lot about this i mean
[02:34:54.640 --> 02:35:00.240]  this looks like the soviet union or something i mean this stuff is off the chain uh we're seeing
[02:35:00.240 --> 02:35:07.040]  as you said the acceleration of the gulag casino economy or casino gulag economy with the prostitutes
[02:35:07.040 --> 02:35:13.120]  running the defense for the new world order i mean how far is this going to go how many
[02:35:13.120 --> 02:35:18.480]  minions of the system are going to slit their own children's throats economically politically to go
[02:35:18.480 --> 02:35:24.000]  along with a bunch of criminal bankers sure the national inquirer is feeding a steady images of
[02:35:24.000 --> 02:35:28.720]  john dravolta and crossdressing i don't want to hear about that i don't want to be diverted with
[02:35:28.720 --> 02:35:33.600]  all these gay marriage distractions regardless of what side you're on they throw that in there
[02:35:33.600 --> 02:35:38.400]  to get us fighting with each other that white house got caught running the trevon martin thing
[02:35:38.400 --> 02:35:43.280]  with instigators from the justice department trying to get a race war going they're shipping guns
[02:35:43.280 --> 02:35:48.960]  into mexico to blame the second amendment this government is criminal they are the enemy and
[02:35:48.960 --> 02:35:53.920]  we got to come together max keiser yeah i hear you buddy you know on your show for a couple
[02:35:53.920 --> 02:35:59.280]  of years we've been talking about people renouncing their us citizenship because they don't agree with
[02:35:59.280 --> 02:36:03.600]  american politics and we see it now with one of the co-founders of facebook he's in switzerland he's
[02:36:03.600 --> 02:36:08.080]  going to move to to singapore he's in singapore now and he's saying look i want to renounce my
[02:36:08.080 --> 02:36:13.760]  us citizenship it's got nothing to do with taxes i just don't want to be a part of the us system and
[02:36:13.760 --> 02:36:18.000]  last year record number of people renounce their us citizenship because they don't agree with the
[02:36:18.000 --> 02:36:23.440]  politics they don't want to be a part of the us system and this trend is continuing and we've
[02:36:23.440 --> 02:36:28.400]  talked about it and i've said that in my opinion the smart thing to do is to renounce their us
[02:36:28.400 --> 02:36:33.680]  citizenship you said you think that it makes more sense to stay and fight and i have a description
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:38.880]  of those who stay and fight it's called police assisted suicide you know because go ahead stay
[02:36:38.880 --> 02:36:43.920]  in fight but you're going to go down in a blaze of police bullets uh on your way out the door
[02:36:43.920 --> 02:36:51.200]  very normal but you're not going to be breathing oh max look look you're always seeing them us is
[02:36:51.200 --> 02:36:55.600]  going to collapse and i agree it is because but we're going to use that crisis that they create
[02:36:55.600 --> 02:37:00.880]  to wake people up and get our republic back you jumped out of the fire into hades i mean i
[02:37:00.880 --> 02:37:05.280]  call i remember arguing you two years ago you're like yeah europe's being raped by the same people
[02:37:05.280 --> 02:37:10.720]  but you know whatever i mean europe is going to be just as bad or worse man we i mean i don't blame
[02:37:10.720 --> 02:37:15.920]  you want to live in paris it's beautiful and wonderful but come on man no we live in paris
[02:37:15.920 --> 02:37:22.160]  because it's the best place to do our show but we are completely mobile you know we go around the
[02:37:22.160 --> 02:37:30.400]  world but we don't set up shop in any one location especially not in the us because at some point you
[02:37:30.400 --> 02:37:36.400]  won't be able to leave the u.s that wall between america and mexico is to keep americans in uh you
[02:37:36.400 --> 02:37:40.400]  won't be able to leave your money won't be able to leave so when they do turn the spigot off and
[02:37:40.400 --> 02:37:45.840]  they do devalue and you try to diversify out of the dollar and into precious metals it's too late
[02:37:45.840 --> 02:37:51.920]  man oh no the t.s saying that's ten fifteen twenty dollars a gallon no job nothing but food stamps
[02:37:51.920 --> 02:37:56.720]  in the casino gulag spinning the roulette wheel hoping to make a nickel you know there's to buy a
[02:37:56.720 --> 02:38:04.000]  cup of coffee to sustain yourself for the next two weeks and a bunch of paramilitary police running
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:10.480]  around doesn't sound fun so anyway here's the big news i don't know if you caught it or not but i
[02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:17.760]  am officially advising rosa and bar as an economic advisor to her presidential candidacy
[02:38:19.200 --> 02:38:23.200]  very exciting we had her on last year and of course i gave the number to people and they
[02:38:23.200 --> 02:38:28.160]  never got put in the computer but i'm gonna i'm gonna get her back on the uh back on the show
[02:38:28.160 --> 02:38:32.720]  she's a very interesting lady very funny and so tell us about that but i'm more interested
[02:38:32.720 --> 02:38:38.160]  in the fact i dropped out of my support of ron paul i'm switching to rosa and bar i think rosa and
[02:38:38.160 --> 02:38:44.400]  bar has a much more robust platform than ron paul she's more electable than ron paul and she's got
[02:38:44.400 --> 02:38:50.560]  uh me as an advisor if ron paul had me as an advisor i i i would maybe support him but spoken
[02:38:50.560 --> 02:38:56.960]  like a true but listen he's got other folks advising him which uh they're doing a fairly decent job but
[02:38:56.960 --> 02:39:02.960]  rosa and bar for 2012 very interesting as she'll certainly get some issues out there what about
[02:39:02.960 --> 02:39:09.040]  you're gonna be on a panel with henry kissinger yep coming up in june in st petersburg russia the

[02:39:43.600 --> 02:39:48.240]  instinct is for you to not even talk about this you're going to get kicked off the panel max
[02:39:48.240 --> 02:39:53.120]  i always found it's better to sneak attack the issue to stop i'm raring to go i'm in training
[02:39:53.120 --> 02:39:58.640]  when i get i'm actually doing a morning workout and i'm building up my muscle in my physique so
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:04.000]  if i if i get into a 50 cuffs with an 85 year old or 95 year old henry kissinger i want to make sure
[02:40:04.000 --> 02:40:09.280]  i win because otherwise it'd be very embarrassing for me to lose in a in a in a wrestling match with
[02:40:09.280 --> 02:40:14.000]  henry kissinger in st petersburg be like an andy koffman wrestling match i mean yeah i don't want
[02:40:14.000 --> 02:40:19.280]  to lose any koffman he showed the way but if any of these guys you know there's going to be a whole
[02:40:19.280 --> 02:40:24.160]  same guys from daubos we could i think both of you should wear matching tutus and wrestle around

[02:40:28.480 --> 02:40:32.800]  let's let you people do this before debates let's debate back and forth because all he does is

[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:42.000]  speak with it's totally fake he talks real slow like it's deliberative it's a total act like you're
[02:40:42.000 --> 02:40:48.880]  getting something really special uh from the mobile pustule uh the self-propelled uh
[02:40:48.880 --> 02:40:54.640]  pus bag that is dr henry kissinger but let's just practice i'll be henry kissinger and i'll be up

[02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:08.240]  that out of the different systematic systems and then what we will do is the larger banks will
[02:41:08.240 --> 02:41:14.720]  run everything and the it's just the fault of the people raise their taxes for bank of bailout
[02:41:15.360 --> 02:41:23.840]  rendable bomb a good day what do you say max keiser hey henry pull my finger
[02:41:25.840 --> 02:41:30.960]  okay that seriously though keiser now listen here's my message when i go to st petersburg it's
[02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:36.320]  the message i brought to channel four live at 10 o'clock which they banned from people in the
[02:41:36.320 --> 02:41:42.240]  uk from actually seeing the video of me on 10 o'clock live on channel four last year the message
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:47.280]  is simple hang the bankers and we got to bring capital punishment for people who commit crimes
[02:41:47.280 --> 02:41:52.640]  against capital number one on the list jamie diamond number two loy blank fine it's easy
[02:41:52.640 --> 02:41:58.320]  they make themselves now known they are in the open their balance sheets are vulnerable let's
[02:41:58.320 --> 02:42:03.600]  attack them by buying physical silver let's take them down to the uh the gear team and do what we
[02:42:03.600 --> 02:42:10.320]  have to do that's the only way you can keep the democracy fresh as jeberson said every 50 years
[02:42:10.320 --> 02:42:17.040]  or so keep the blood of democracy fresh with an insert but david rocker fell over the united
[02:42:17.040 --> 02:42:24.400]  nations is going to help us it's more of a russian henry kissinger i mean henry kissinger looks more
[02:42:24.400 --> 02:42:30.240]  like a self-propelled criminals are going to be there i'm i'm being invited i'm on two panels

[02:42:40.080 --> 02:42:46.080]  is let in to the event so rt is very excited of course rt is the big media sponsor of this
[02:42:46.080 --> 02:42:52.640]  event in st petersburg i'm the number one show on rt so uh we're going to go down if it requires
[02:42:52.640 --> 02:42:56.480]  50 cups with henry kissinger that's what that's what we're going to do so we're building this up
[02:42:56.480 --> 02:43:01.920]  like a don king fight i mean he's no one's going to miss him they i think he man died 10 years ago
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:07.440]  what is she it's a taxidermist came in he stuffed he's just a talking puppet he the guy died 10
[02:43:07.440 --> 02:43:11.760]  years ago hey man you know that's what he actually looks like is that maybe they did take his body
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:16.720]  and then stuff it and then it just kind of moves with some little mechanical apparatus yeah he's
[02:43:16.720 --> 02:43:22.400]  been embalmed so yeah that's why i guess the the the sound quality gets worse and worse because
[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:27.280]  the tanks that are in his skull playing the same ridiculous nonsense over and over again
[02:43:28.480 --> 02:43:33.840]  oh man you got to stop it right now what about you and henry kissinger oil wrestling
[02:43:36.080 --> 02:43:38.000]  pay per view would make 300 million dollars
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:46.880]  ptv event that'd be fantastic you could ask him hair kissinger would you oil wrestle both of

[02:47:22.960 --> 02:47:29.360]  got he got fingered by jeremy paxman who's on their nighttime bbc uh news night program who could
[02:47:29.360 --> 02:47:34.480]  testify in front of their committee saying that pierce morgan told him how to hack phones
[02:47:34.480 --> 02:47:42.400]  which totally uh confirms to what i told i've been telling people now for several years the editor of
[02:47:42.400 --> 02:47:51.600]  the sunday mirror tina weaver told me directly in 2003 that she was aware of the phone hacking
[02:47:51.600 --> 02:47:56.480]  she said pierce morgan was aware of the phone hacking and furthermore she threatened me
[02:47:56.480 --> 02:48:03.680]  indirectly by by using a phone hacking scandal as part of a scandal that she was involved with
[02:48:03.680 --> 02:48:08.800]  so she should also be pulled into this phone hacking scandal and of course it jumps the

[02:54:24.960 --> 02:54:31.360]  all right kaiser has all the tony Blair stuff's true and the weird rituals are true but i think
[02:54:31.360 --> 02:54:37.040]  kaiser did a joke on us with the david cameron stuff we have paul watson here and i think it's an
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:45.280]  anti um anglophile thing is what i think is going on here i think max kaiser's made a joke on us
[02:54:45.280 --> 02:54:51.520]  paul watson joining us from uh just north of london he tells us he's not heard of this club
[02:54:51.520 --> 02:54:57.920]  paul watson you're on with max kaiser have you not heard of this uh olfactory club that uh
[02:54:57.920 --> 02:55:05.840]  david cameron is part of i've heard of the bullyington club which is the student club out of oxford
[02:55:05.840 --> 02:55:10.640]  where cameron like to go and smash up local restaurants with the rest of his tough friends
[02:55:10.640 --> 02:55:17.040]  and laugh about it is that the same one this is this was told to me you know that goldsmith is
[02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:23.760]  right yeah he told me directly what personally when i was writing for his magazine the ecologist
[02:55:23.760 --> 02:55:30.880]  that himself and george osborne who was in the bullyington club which is another club were involved
[02:55:30.880 --> 02:55:37.600]  in this uh anonymous spartan club all right stop the problem is is that's exactly the kind of
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:42.320]  stuff they do these people are out of their minds folks i mean i'm telling you it's admitted in news
[02:55:42.320 --> 02:55:48.560]  articles uh that people the uh was the vanity fair guy snuck in and saw henry kissinger and drag
[02:55:48.560 --> 02:55:52.400]  we've got some of their books that show other guys in drag actually i think kissinger is in
[02:55:52.400 --> 02:55:56.320]  drag in one of them i gotta dig that out and put that on the web but the point is is we're talking
[02:55:56.320 --> 02:56:02.080]  about pornographic stuff where not not completely pornographic but henry kissinger's doing things
[02:56:02.080 --> 02:56:07.120]  and acting like he's doing things i mean this is insane and these people are insane i mean folks
[02:56:07.120 --> 02:56:12.720]  come on the guy's running than they have good sense i mean when you get after you make your first
[02:56:12.720 --> 02:56:16.400]  you know half a billion dollars you're just bored you're bored out of your skull so you
[02:56:16.400 --> 02:56:21.440]  invent silly things like trying to guess each other's farts in dark rooms that's the problem
[02:56:21.440 --> 02:56:27.520]  with this economy is that it engenders billionaires and billions of people with no money at all
[02:56:27.520 --> 02:56:32.160]  hey watson i want you to look into this this is a major investigation are the bill de berg group
