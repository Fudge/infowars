[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:22.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:22.000 --> 00:24.000]  We're live.
[00:24.000 --> 00:34.000]  We have a huge broadcast lined up for you on this 30th of July, 2014, but I was re-watching a report from about two weeks ago that David Knight filed.
[00:34.000 --> 00:45.000]  I was watching it last night, and it's so good, I thought I would air an excerpt of it, Prison Planet of the Apes, with our own co-host, David Knight.
[00:45.000 --> 00:52.000]  This is the type of stuff that airs every night, 7 o'clock central, with info wars, nightly news.
[00:52.000 --> 01:01.000]  There's a new book that's come out. It's called Animal Madness, how anxious dogs, compulsive parrots, and elephants in recovery can help us to understand ourselves.
[01:01.000 --> 01:17.000]  Now, the interesting thing about this book is that rather than looking at drugs being tested on animals, it takes drugs that have, first of all, of course, tested on animals, then used routinely on humans, and now have gone full circle back into the zoo.
[01:17.000 --> 01:24.000]  And so it provides us some interesting insights. And of course, in reviews, people have talked about anthropomorphism.
[01:24.000 --> 01:32.000]  In other words, projecting human characteristics onto animals. I say to speak of mental illness in animals requires a degree of anthropomorphizing.
[01:32.000 --> 01:39.000]  Or this is a humane, insightful, beautifully written book, Animal Madness gives anthropomorphism a good name.
[01:39.000 --> 01:45.000]  What about anthropomorphism in reverse? Yes, are we treating humans like animals?
[01:45.000 --> 01:52.000]  I'll take a look at a couple of the excerpts from the book, but before we do, there's also another school of thought in how we control animals.
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  And of course, is the B.F. Skinner Behavioral Modification School. We use positive, operant conditioning to control the animals.
[01:59.000 --> 02:04.000]  Skinner's techniques are actually a humane way to communicate with and to control animals.
[02:04.000 --> 02:14.000]  The problem arises with the reverse anthropomorphism when Skinner starts to treat humans as animals, devoid of freedom and dignity.
[02:14.000 --> 02:24.000]  Of course, much of our government's interaction with everyone from children in schools to airplane travelers with TSA is based on positive, operant conditioning.
[02:24.000 --> 02:30.000]  In other words, let me touch you wherever I want and I'll reward you with allowing you to get on a plane.
[02:30.000 --> 02:34.000]  Now, of course, the other popular way to control people is with pharmaceuticals.
[02:34.000 --> 02:43.000]  If Mr. McMurphy doesn't want to take his medication orally, I'm sure we can arrange that he can have it some other way.
[02:43.000 --> 02:46.000]  Brightman's book gives us some perspectives on that.
[02:46.000 --> 02:49.000]  Now, Thorazine, of course, was first tested on rats.
[02:49.000 --> 02:58.000]  And what they found was that even though rats could easily climb up a rope to get to some food, once they put them on Thorazine, they couldn't be bothered.
[02:58.000 --> 03:02.000]  Even when they knew a shock was coming on, they would just sit there.
[03:02.000 --> 03:05.000]  What happened when they gave Thorazine to a gorilla in the zoo?
[03:05.000 --> 03:12.000]  This is a gorilla that was going to have to be relocated to a very small cage for a period of six months while his usual habitat was repaired.
[03:12.000 --> 03:17.000]  So what they did to help him cope was what any good psychiatrist would do.
[03:17.000 --> 03:19.000]  They put some Thorazine in his coke.
[03:19.000 --> 03:21.000]  What did that do for him?
[03:21.000 --> 03:24.000]  Well, the zookeeper said he shuffled back and forth across this cage with dulled eyes.
[03:24.000 --> 03:29.000]  It was a little like watching the men in one flew over the cuckoo's nest.
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.000]  Now, a review of her book that's on Wired.com today covers a couple of interesting anecdotes entitled,
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  Even the Gorillas and Bears in Our Zoo are Hooked on Prozac.
[03:38.000 --> 03:43.000]  They look at what happens when we take these drugs that we've now approved for massive use on humans
[03:43.000 --> 03:46.000]  and then turn around and use them on animals in the zoo.
[03:46.000 --> 03:54.000]  Gus, the famous polar bear from the Central Park Zoo, was put on Prozac because he was swimming for 12 hours a day.
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  Now, as an aside, that's what polar bears do.
[03:57.000 --> 03:59.000]  They range over hundreds of miles.
[03:59.000 --> 04:06.000]  And of course, that's why you see all these pictures of polar bears sitting on ice flows looking like they're forworn,
[04:06.000 --> 04:08.000]  like their habitat is melting.
[04:08.000 --> 04:10.000]  No, they range over several hundred miles a day.
[04:10.000 --> 04:13.000]  So this polar bear was swimming 12 hours a day.
[04:13.000 --> 04:19.000]  And they said that that is.0009% of his usual habitat.
[04:19.000 --> 04:23.000]  But of course, instead of giving him a larger habitat, which they couldn't do,
[04:23.000 --> 04:26.000]  they put him on Prozac to try to control his behavior.
[04:26.000 --> 04:31.000]  Now, some of the zookeepers who were using psychopharmaceuticals on these animals
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  were curious if other zoos were doing the same thing.
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  Half of the 31 institutions throughout the U.S. and Canada that responded to their survey
[04:39.000 --> 04:43.000]  had used psychopharmaceuticals on their gorillas.
[04:43.000 --> 04:49.000]  Again, that's just part of the video report that he filed for the nightly news last week.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  Prison Planet of the Apes.
[04:51.000 --> 04:56.000]  I'm going to retweet it right now from my iPhone during this break at Real Alex Jones.
[04:56.000 --> 05:06.000]  Spread it far and wide.
[05:27.000 --> 05:36.000]  This is not a low-grade formula.
[05:36.000 --> 05:40.000]  We are working with one of the top laboratory manufacturers in the United States
[05:40.000 --> 05:45.000]  to bring you the best form of colloidal silver using electrical processes
[05:45.000 --> 05:49.000]  within a base of deionized water for your preparedness storage.
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  For your home kitchen, purchase your bottle of infowarslife.com,
[05:53.000 --> 05:59.000]  put colloidal silver today, and find other amazing supplements at infowarslife.com.
[05:59.000 --> 06:03.000]  I began to get into iodine a few years ago because it was helping me and my family so much
[06:03.000 --> 06:05.000]  get healthy and detoxify.
[06:05.000 --> 06:10.000]  Most people know that iodine deficiency has been a crisis around the world.
[06:10.000 --> 06:15.000]  Iodine is key to so many of the body's functions, especially the thyroid.
[06:15.000 --> 06:18.000]  I discovered a product being developed by Dr. Group.
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.000]  You know it as survival shield, true nascent iodine that your body can really absorb.
[06:23.000 --> 06:26.000]  Then, about a year ago, he said, listen, if you think this is powerful,
[06:26.000 --> 06:30.000]  I'm going to come out with rare earth, deep earth crystals.
[06:30.000 --> 06:34.000]  And the results that I personally have had have been life changing.
[06:34.000 --> 06:39.000]  Nobody else has got iodine based on these pure crystals, ladies and gentlemen.
[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  This is innovating, and the best part is it helps fund infowars.com, the radio show, the TV show,
[06:45.000 --> 06:48.000]  the whole media operation promoting true libertarian ideas.
[06:48.000 --> 06:52.000]  For a limited time, experience the ancient power of survival shield X2.
[06:52.000 --> 06:58.000]  Take advantage of this unprecedented 30% off super detox special at infowarslife.com.
[06:58.000 --> 07:04.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic
[07:04.000 --> 07:07.000]  each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[07:07.000 --> 07:13.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air.
[07:13.000 --> 07:18.000]  And most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[07:18.000 --> 07:21.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States.
[07:21.000 --> 07:25.000]  Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[07:30.000 --> 07:35.000]  When I began to research these statistics, it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.000]  in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but that we can fight back against.
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A.
[07:45.000 --> 07:51.000]  The new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[07:51.000 --> 08:16.000]  Now available exclusively at info wars life dot com or by calling toll three eight eight eight two five three one three nine.
[08:16.000 --> 08:22.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[08:22.000 --> 08:28.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[08:28.000 --> 08:42.000]  If you go back over a month ago, we re-reviewed the BAMF Canada Security Prosperity Partnership secret meeting from 2007
[08:42.000 --> 08:49.000]  where we learned part of the text of the secret North American Union Treaty of 2005
[08:49.000 --> 08:58.000]  signed in Waco, Texas at Baylor University by the Canadian Prime Minister, the U.S. President and the Mexican President.
[08:58.000 --> 09:04.000]  And in that document that we cover in my film Endgame blueprint for global enslavement,
[09:04.000 --> 09:13.000]  they say we will achieve North American integration and a North American Union for merger with the EU and the Pacific Union
[09:13.000 --> 09:18.000]  with our corporate administrators completely bypassing the nation states.
[09:18.000 --> 09:21.000]  I'm paraphrasing quotes out of it.
[09:21.000 --> 09:30.000]  You can go read these just watching ensued and got them the documents thousands of pages that I read much of which on air was covered.
[09:30.000 --> 09:43.000]  And they say we will use the threat of terrorism, border collapse,
[09:43.000 --> 09:54.000]  and we will use epidemics like the flu or Ebola to bring in global governance.
[09:54.000 --> 10:00.000]  So just as the White House former Chief of Staff, now the Chicago Don,
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.000]  Rahm Emanuel famously said to the Wall Street Journal television,
[10:05.000 --> 10:12.000]  don't let a good crisis go to waste.
[10:12.000 --> 10:18.000]  They are using this Ebola situation that is undoubtedly the worst Ebola outbreak ever.
[10:18.000 --> 10:30.000]  Undoubtedly the worst Ebola outbreak ever to sell more global handling of tracking the disease.
[10:30.000 --> 10:33.000]  And I want to explain something.
[10:33.000 --> 10:38.000]  Interviewing multiple medical doctors, Harvard medical doctors you name it over the years,
[10:38.000 --> 10:42.000]  and a lot of articles have been written about this, you can look them up for yourself.
[10:42.000 --> 10:55.000]  There's a lot of evidence that Ebola was developed in laboratories and then released in the jungles of western and central Africa in the last 30, 40 years.
[10:55.000 --> 11:03.000]  And that as it mutates, it will become more aggressive and even airborne.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  And then one of the heads of the University of Texas Biology Department,
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  and I want to do another special report on this week, maybe do it for the nightly news tonight,
[11:14.000 --> 11:20.000]  Dr. Eric Pionka, who is a global exterminist.
[11:20.000 --> 11:25.000]  He believes that at least 90% of the population should be reduced.
[11:25.000 --> 11:31.000]  His acolytes, his graduate students that are now medical doctors, PhDs, microbiologists,
[11:31.000 --> 11:41.000]  responded to us criticizing him six years ago and the FBI visiting him by sending me open letters that we published saying,
[11:41.000 --> 11:44.000]  listen, we will exterminate everyone.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  Pionka is not radical enough.
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.000]  Humanity is a parasite and must be dealt with.
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  In fact, here's quotes from the Texas newspapers that reported on out of Houston.
[11:57.000 --> 12:02.000]  I watched an amazement as a few hundred members of the Texas Academy of Sciences rose to their feet
[12:02.000 --> 12:14.000]  and gave standing ovation to a speech that enthusiastically advocated the elimination of 90% of the Earth's population by airborne Ebola.
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.000]  That's what the newspaper reporter quoted to the Houston Chronicle.
[12:21.000 --> 12:31.000]  They weren't politically correct yet properly to go, of course, we must exterminate everyone.
[12:31.000 --> 12:45.000]  While speaking to the group on a giant movie screen behind him was projected piles of skulls from the Rwanda massacre in 1994 with a red filter.
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.000]  And I've seen photos of that.
[12:47.000 --> 12:49.000]  You can look them up online.
[12:49.000 --> 13:13.000]  A man standing there saying, I pray for the blessed day when the airborne weaponized Ebola is released and 90 plus percent of the world dies as blood hemorrhages from every orifice.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  And now hundreds and hundreds of deaths spreading all over Africa.
[13:19.000 --> 13:23.000]  There are now people on the ground in Germany that have Ebola.
[13:23.000 --> 13:25.000]  They're treating people at hospitals in Germany.
[13:25.000 --> 13:33.000]  A man collapsed before he could get on a African flight inbound to Minneapolis, St. Paul.
[13:33.000 --> 13:42.000]  That's the top headline up at m4wars.com, prisonplanet.com and drudgerport.com from the Daily Beast.
[13:42.000 --> 13:47.000]  He could have brought Ebola here, Minnesota widow on her husband.
[13:47.000 --> 13:56.000]  Patrick Sawyer was supposed to be with his kid's birthday party in a few weeks, but he died of the virus before he could board a flight to Minneapolis.
[13:56.000 --> 14:01.000]  His wife spoke out on the epidemic's toll.
[14:01.000 --> 14:11.000]  Nigeria felt a chill from the hot zone when 40 year old man collapsed and died from the dread Ebola virus after flying there from Liberia.
[14:11.000 --> 14:28.000]  That hot zone chill now reaches America with words the same man was scheduled to fly to Minneapolis in time for the August 16th party celebrating the birthday of two of the three young daughters.
[14:28.000 --> 14:37.000]  Guys, can we look up 12 monkeys and find the clip where the bio weapons worker releases the bio weapon or is bragging about it?
[14:37.000 --> 14:42.000]  An environmental animal rights activist.
[14:42.000 --> 14:51.000]  Bruce Willis has been sent back from the future to try to stop it.
[14:51.000 --> 14:55.000]  What are you going to do? All of you arrogant narcissists out there,
[14:55.000 --> 15:08.000]  when this or some super weaponized SARS or the flesh eating bacteria, the drug resistant TB starts literally eating your lungs.
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  What are you going to do when your family members are dead?
[15:12.000 --> 15:20.000]  I know two people very close to my family, my uncle and my cousin that are dead in the last six months, seven months from this.
[15:20.000 --> 15:26.000]  And in the hospital, they said we're turning people away. It's an epidemic, but it's not on the news.
[15:26.000 --> 15:38.000]  It came out in a few newspapers in Texas and other states that there was a quiet epidemic and the hospitals under CDC orders would not release even what it was.
[15:38.000 --> 16:01.000]  And I even saw that in Newsweek yesterday researching drug resistant bacteria or superbugs. Just type in the term and click it and you'll see the articles this week where they admit maybe one out of a thousand deaths from drug resistant bacteria is being reported by the hospitals.
[16:01.000 --> 16:12.000]  And do you know why? Because they've been told by the CDC shut up and they don't want you to know that if you go in there to have a hernia operation or you go in there to have your Achilles tendon worked on,
[16:12.000 --> 16:28.000]  or if you go into one of these facilities to even get a small spinal surgery or to get a inspection of your colon with a colonoscopy that you've got a major chance.
[16:28.000 --> 16:37.000]  Now I've looked at the numbers, they try to cover these up, but if you add them together, the number one cause of death is not heart attacks, it's not cancer anymore in this country, it's hospitals.
[16:37.000 --> 16:53.000]  And every doctor I know goes to private elite clinics for inpatient care to have their surgeries. That's where all the rich people go. They don't go near a hospital.
[16:53.000 --> 17:07.000]  They don't go anywhere near them. Because let me tell you, you can say this Ebola's hype, it's not. This is the most serious Ebola outbreak ever. Hands down, the scientists are on record.
[17:07.000 --> 17:10.000]  This just popped up on Drudge.
[17:10.000 --> 17:25.000]  Part of CMRER roped off, officials say patient being tested. The corridor of the medical center's main emergency room was roped off on the first floor.
[17:25.000 --> 17:35.000]  This is in Charlotte, North Carolina. At Carolina's medical center near the entrance Wednesday, a security guard was posted outside to prevent anyone from crossing the line.
[17:35.000 --> 17:51.000]  The question is, is it Ebola? By the way, the heroic African doctor who has treated thousands over the years for Ebola has died.
[17:51.000 --> 17:59.000]  Here's the headline, if Ebola hits the U.S., even healthy Americans will be quarantined.
[17:59.000 --> 18:16.000]  Persons who do not show symptoms would be forcibly detained. If you come in out of an African country that they think may have this, they're going to lock you up.
[18:16.000 --> 18:37.000]  The bigger question is, why are they making a big deal out of this? It is a big deal, but why are they making a big deal out of it? When they've covered up, basically flesh-eating bacteria killing people across the board, jumping into their lungs and drug-resistant and drug-immune staff and strep.
[18:37.000 --> 18:51.000]  In all the antibiotics, they feed the farm animals that we then eat. Congressional report, Ebola bio-kits have been secretly deployed to National Guard units in all 50 states.
[18:51.000 --> 19:12.000]  They're preparing. Remember they've been pre-deploying for massive outbreaks? Again, could this end up being another part of the crisis? While our border is wide open and Africans, Pakistanis, you name it, was in the news yesterday, are just pouring across by the thousands as the border is wide open,
[19:12.000 --> 19:23.000]  but then they're going to use it to take your rights out there, America. That's just some of the news. Global authorities on the alert over Ebola outbreak.
[19:23.000 --> 19:44.000]  Ebola doctor quarantined in Canada. Ebola outbreak victim who sparked fears of global epidemic was on his way to U.S. Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctor dies from the virus. The doctor leading Sierra Leone's fight against the worst Ebola outbreak on record died from the virus yesterday.
[19:44.000 --> 19:58.000]  The country's chief medical examiner said the death of Sheik Umar Khan. That's a true practitioner of medicine right there. They're right back.
[20:14.000 --> 20:29.000]  The country's chief medical examiner said the death of Sheik Umar Khan. That's a true practitioner of medicine right there.
[20:29.000 --> 20:58.000]  The country's chief medical examiner said the death of Sheik Umar Khan. That's a true practitioner of medicine right there.
[21:00.000 --> 21:09.000]  When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in. In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries.
[21:09.000 --> 21:25.000]  During that period, key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation, but no one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors, and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time.
[21:25.000 --> 21:38.000]  We now have the synergistic solution. DNA Force, just one of the key compounds. BiopQQ is backed by major clinical studies and over 175 PubMed listed published studies.

[22:53.000 --> 22:57.000]  ProEM1 from Tarragonix. Life's getting better.
[22:57.000 --> 23:07.000]  We the people grow cotton, wheat fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit and carting to a private bank having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to serve as debt.
[23:07.000 --> 23:14.000]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing to public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[23:14.000 --> 23:27.000]  Hey Anderson, I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system. Call for your copy 800-686-2237. It's time to understand the system. Call 800-686-2237. That's 800-686-2237.

[23:34.000 --> 23:46.000]  Manipulated financial markets and economic figures? Chaos on our border? China and Russia bypassing the dollar. Life is getting ready to change. You need to prepare to thrive in the new economy.

[24:13.000 --> 24:21.000]  He's been a guest on this show, Geraldo Rivera. I've been on this show I think five, six times over the years on Fox.
[24:21.000 --> 24:39.000]  I like Geraldo Rivera at many levels, but because he's, I guess, has some ancestry connected to Puerto Rico, I guess he's bonded the propaganda that we've just got to have a totally open border to the south and let anybody enter your racist.
[24:39.000 --> 24:48.000]  And he has come out and said, shame on Drudge. His authoritative website has gone hysterical on the issue of immigration children.
[24:48.000 --> 25:05.000]  Fourteen stories like, could Ebola sneak across? He hasn't had 14 stories saying that. The news has pointed out that drug-resistant TB, leprosy, black plague has now, bubonic plague has popped up, as you know, in Colorado.
[25:05.000 --> 25:17.000]  I mean, they're locking hospitals down in Germany in the U.S. Ebola has gotten into Germany. They're reportedly treating people in Germany that have come out of Africa with Ebola.
[25:17.000 --> 25:29.000]  Do you understand that, Geraldo? There's a reason we have a border. There's a reason, Geraldo, that you don't live in Puerto Rico because it's not as nice as New York.
[25:29.000 --> 25:44.000]  Puerto Rico, by the way, is great compared to Guatemala. So do you want them to issue enough green cards to legalize the population of Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala?
[25:44.000 --> 25:54.000]  Because that's in the Congressional Budget Office's own numbers. That's in the bill. I mean, this is joke-level what's being pushed.
[25:54.000 --> 26:08.000]  And I'm really concerned about superbugs coming across. I'm really concerned when I've been arrested for demonstrating that I'll get TB in jail overnight, because that's where you get it, Geraldo.
[26:08.000 --> 26:23.000]  And when you get TB or any of this stuff in jail, nobody cares about you. In fact, if you get drug-resistant, they lock you up for months or years in these modern sanitarium wards that are now popping up across the United States.
[26:23.000 --> 26:32.000]  If you have drug-resistant TB and you get caught trying to fly, they arrest you and you get years in prison in a medical ward.
[26:32.000 --> 26:43.000]  But then we're like, well, why are the illegals allowed to just walk across with it? Why are no medical testing being done of all these people being dumped out of the Mexican, Guatemalan, and other hospitals?
[26:43.000 --> 26:54.000]  And an old Rivera's like, you're racist. See, the laws are suspended. If I was an illegal alien, I could fly without ID.
[26:54.000 --> 27:03.000]  I could come across the border and be given bus tickets wherever I wanted. But as a citizen, I get harassed at the border, because the border is there to control the people.
[27:03.000 --> 27:12.000]  They want more people inside the U.S. to turn them into political slaves. They want to exploit these Latin Americans, but they're still being used as a weapon.
[27:12.000 --> 27:17.000]  So Sierra Leone's top Ebola doctor has died.
[27:17.000 --> 27:26.000]  Part of CMRER roped off in North Carolina because of possible Ebola.
[27:26.000 --> 27:32.000]  We've got the headlines. Could Ebola sneak across the U.S. border? I don't know. Can fish swim in the ocean?
[27:32.000 --> 27:42.000]  Germany accepts infected patient for treatment as medical services across Europe or on high alert to prevent any risk of Ebola spreading here.
[27:42.000 --> 27:46.000]  A hospital in Germany accepts a patient with the virus.
[27:46.000 --> 27:54.000]  Yeah, you know why? Because bio weapons producers guaranteed the Pentagon wants that blood. That's why that's happening.
[27:54.000 --> 28:03.000]  Ebola outbreak. Deadly foreign diseases. Our potential major threat says chief scientist and says they are a threat getting into western nations.
[28:03.000 --> 28:14.000]  That's the one in Telegraph. Maybe Geraldo Rivera will send a tweet at those scientists and say they're racist, huh?
[28:14.000 --> 28:24.000]  To see everything's racist, not bowing down, not accepting Obamacare's racist, not turning your guns in as racist. We've all been told that.
[28:24.000 --> 28:32.000]  You know what? We're sick of it. There's another story up on infowars.com. Keith Oberman has gone on a multi-tweet, five or six tweets I was reading,
[28:32.000 --> 28:45.000]  attack on infowars.com, prisonplanet.com and drudgereport.com, literally calling us liars and saying that we believe in elves and magical creatures,
[28:45.000 --> 28:53.000]  and that we're totally insane and basically cussing at us and calling us all sorts of names.
[28:53.000 --> 29:02.000]  This is a guy that was showing an ESPN who would cover false flags to get us into the Iraq war when it came out in the British news,
[29:02.000 --> 29:13.000]  who would cover real stuff when he was bashing Republicans, rightfully so. But as soon as Democrats got in, this guy became a total whore of the establishment.
[29:13.000 --> 29:18.000]  What a disgusting creature.
[29:18.000 --> 29:26.000]  There are those tweets up in an article and video that Paul Watson did up on infowars.com. I hope some of my writers do a story on William Benny,
[29:26.000 --> 29:32.000]  the top NSA whistleblower saying Obama should be impeached for the NSA spying because he's made it even worse,
[29:32.000 --> 29:38.000]  and saying that intelligence agencies have had a coup d'etat over our government. I thought that was a newsmaking interview.
[29:38.000 --> 29:47.000]  It was worldwide when he told lesser things to the Guardian, but again, we just keep dropping big bombshells here every five minutes.
[29:47.000 --> 29:49.000]  There's news coming up.
[29:49.000 --> 29:59.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:59.000 --> 30:09.000]  Hi, I'm Dr. Edward Grupp. It took me 20 years of searching the globe to find the deposit of the highest purity iodine available.
[30:09.000 --> 30:20.000]  The new survival shield X2 is mined from 7 to 10,000 feet below the Earth in pristine, environmentally clean conditions.
[30:20.000 --> 30:30.000]  The iodine crystals we use are extracted from an ancient 300 million plus year old deposit deep in the Earth.
[30:30.000 --> 30:38.000]  It's the strongest nascent iodine on the market today. It delivers 650 micrograms per drop.
[30:38.000 --> 30:42.000]  Experience the new formula. Experience the ancient purity.

[31:16.000 --> 31:21.000]  I just received my male vitality about three days ago and I must say that was good stuff.
[31:21.000 --> 31:31.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others, we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula.
[31:31.000 --> 31:38.000]  Super male vitality by infowarslife is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[31:38.000 --> 31:44.000]  I jump out of bed ready to fight these criminals every day. I look forward to waking up and taking my super male vitality and get the day started.

[32:19.000 --> 32:25.000]  Most tap water contains added substances like fluoride, chlorine, glyphosate and many others.
[32:25.000 --> 32:32.000]  Studies prove that these substances are linked to an assortment of major health issues including tooth decay, lower IQ and even cancer.
[32:32.000 --> 32:35.000]  It tastes like you're drinking out of the lake when you're drinking tap water.
[32:35.000 --> 32:43.000]  The Pro Pure G2.0 filtration system removes these deadly substances leaving only fresh tasting, deliciously clean water.
[32:43.000 --> 32:44.000]  This is very tasty.

[32:58.000 --> 33:17.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:28.000 --> 33:53.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[33:53.000 --> 34:03.200]  You notice all hell's breaking loose across the board right now.
[34:03.200 --> 34:11.360]  Dollar devaluation, power prices at all time highs, that's in the news stack today.
[34:11.360 --> 34:16.000]  We've got beef prices and other meat prices at all time highs.
[34:16.000 --> 34:20.560]  And there is a constellation of reasons that's happening as our farming base is shut down
[34:20.560 --> 34:26.560]  under federal regulations, only big agra allowed to operate basically.
[34:26.560 --> 34:30.680]  We also of course have dollar devaluation, I'm not trying to be negative here.
[34:30.680 --> 34:35.840]  You know in the last few years they kept announcing that by 2025 or 2030 we would see driverless
[34:35.840 --> 34:38.080]  cars on the road.
[34:38.080 --> 34:42.920]  We already had driverless cars on multiple state highways in the U.S. when they made
[34:42.920 --> 34:44.480]  those announcements.
[34:44.480 --> 34:49.280]  That's a standard Psyop to announce it's coming in the future to acclimate you to accept
[34:49.280 --> 34:50.280]  it.
[34:50.280 --> 34:57.800]  But in England, Germany and other major countries, they're announcing that driverless cars will
[34:57.800 --> 35:02.480]  hit the streets in five months.
[35:02.480 --> 35:09.360]  Driverless cars heading on the British roads in 2015, same thing in Germany.
[35:09.360 --> 35:17.520]  And they will also double as private and corporate and governmental surveillance hubs, grabbing
[35:17.520 --> 35:24.960]  your private digital information, decoding it and selling it to the highest bidder.
[35:24.960 --> 35:31.200]  So it's the rise of the robots, ladies and gentlemen, that are being built in as basic
[35:31.200 --> 35:38.240]  backdoor Trojan horses into every major system that is out there.
[35:38.240 --> 35:46.000]  Again, I'm not trying to be negative here for everybody.
[35:46.000 --> 35:51.000]  I'm just trying to be honest about what's going on so that people understand the decision
[35:51.000 --> 35:59.680]  has been made to basically convert humanity into drones of the system and to have a rise
[35:59.680 --> 36:00.680]  of the robots.
[36:00.680 --> 36:05.760]  But the rise of the robots is bigger than just automation.
[36:05.760 --> 36:11.480]  The plan is to build a system and design an architecture that doesn't need humans and
[36:11.480 --> 36:12.960]  that is anti-human.
[36:12.960 --> 36:17.500]  We're not building an infrastructure to empower humanity and to give us a future.
[36:17.500 --> 36:25.240]  The decision has been made to build an infrastructure to make us completely obsolescent and to basically
[36:25.240 --> 36:32.600]  turn humans ourselves into a form of robot merging with the machines through Pavlovian
[36:32.600 --> 36:36.000]  conditioning.
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.960]  When an iPhone dings, they've done the studies, you can look them up.
[36:40.960 --> 36:49.040]  People have a Pavlovian response like a dog does to meat.
[36:49.040 --> 36:53.920]  And they all sit back and brag about this and how the tactics work and how they're doing
[36:53.920 --> 36:54.920]  it to you.
[36:54.920 --> 36:59.400]  And these people are traitors against humanity.
[36:59.400 --> 37:16.120]  They keep you in a childlike state where you believe that their rabbit tricks are real.
[37:16.120 --> 37:22.000]  Never knowing that it's a fraud.
[37:22.000 --> 37:24.640]  And for those of you that are awake to this, you're saying, yeah, tell us something we
[37:24.640 --> 37:25.640]  don't know.
[37:25.640 --> 37:28.080]  The general public is in a trance.
[37:28.080 --> 37:30.640]  They believe the frauds.
[37:30.640 --> 37:34.640]  They don't know.
[37:34.640 --> 37:37.200]  They go into a movie and don't look for the propaganda.
[37:37.200 --> 37:43.400]  They sit there and suspend disbelief, absorbing whatever they're told.
[37:43.400 --> 37:50.760]  I want to get your take on the global crises that are accelerating the wars, the destabilizations,
[37:50.760 --> 37:56.160]  the collapse of economies, the moves for bail ins, to take private bank account money in
[37:56.160 --> 38:00.560]  the U.S. and Europe, all those regulatory announcements are being made.
[38:00.560 --> 38:03.400]  The globalists are moving on every front.
[38:03.400 --> 38:18.320]  What do you think the next big shoot a drop is 800-259-9231, 800-259-9231 and we'll get
[38:18.320 --> 38:23.320]  you up and on the air today.
[38:23.320 --> 38:30.920]  Coming back to infowars.com, here are some of the headlines.
[38:30.920 --> 38:37.600]  Geraldo Rivera accuses Matt Drudge of fomenting a civil war over border crisis for simply
[38:37.600 --> 38:42.360]  pointing out that no nation's ever opened its borders like this, accuses Drudge of engaging
[38:42.360 --> 38:48.440]  in racist behavior, Keith Oberman, trash talks, Drudge, info wars, and bizarre Twitter
[38:48.440 --> 38:49.440]  rant.
[38:49.440 --> 38:50.440]  Why is this all happening now?
[38:50.440 --> 38:56.360]  The border is going out, folks, analysts, bill banning NSA data collection will not
[38:56.360 --> 38:59.520]  stop mass spying.
[38:59.520 --> 39:01.880]  Gaza in perspective.
[39:01.880 --> 39:05.200]  Hamas does the bidding of Israel state.
[39:05.200 --> 39:10.000]  Kurt Nemo has an article there that I agree with from one angle, Israel's on record founding
[39:10.000 --> 39:14.520]  Hamas in 1974, the year I was born.
[39:14.520 --> 39:17.920]  That's mainline Israeli news.
[39:17.920 --> 39:25.640]  As a destabilizer, you don't want mainline Muslims who are like Gandhi not being violent
[39:25.640 --> 39:28.520]  because then that makes their position stronger.
[39:28.520 --> 39:33.920]  You want them running around dragging people dead behind motorcycles like Road Warrior,
[39:33.920 --> 39:40.640]  like Humongous and Road Warrior, and firing rockets out of the blue and when an Israel
[39:40.640 --> 39:44.160]  says stop firing rockets, they say we will never stop.
[39:44.160 --> 39:49.120]  See, it's not Israel good, Israel bad, Hamas good, Hamas bad.
[39:49.120 --> 39:51.520]  It's that the whole thing's rigged, folks.
[39:51.520 --> 39:55.800]  And that's why I won't get into the whole cause celeb deal on the Palestinians because
[39:55.800 --> 40:01.400]  why won't you get upset about 300,000 Muslims, Arabs, Arab Christians being killed the last
[40:01.400 --> 40:06.760]  four years by Al Qaeda forces, backed by the globalist?
[40:06.760 --> 40:11.600]  None of the cause celebs out there, none of the people that call me an Israeli agent will
[40:11.600 --> 40:16.800]  talk about Benjamin Netanyahu endorsing ISIS a month ago.
[40:16.800 --> 40:22.120]  Outrageous, and I've criticized that because see, that isn't in the script.
[40:22.120 --> 40:23.280]  That isn't in the Syop.
[40:23.280 --> 40:26.120]  You're supposed to be pro-Palestinian or pro-Israel.
[40:26.120 --> 40:33.120]  You're not supposed to pull back and go, oh, I see the manipulation on record, declassified.
[40:33.120 --> 40:37.320]  You're not supposed to transcend the whole fraud.
[40:37.320 --> 40:40.600]  You're supposed to either hate Palestinians or hate Jews.
[40:40.600 --> 40:42.480]  I'm not going to hate either.
[40:42.480 --> 40:48.920]  They're all just people being played off against each other, and it's bigger than just Israel
[40:48.920 --> 40:52.800]  running Hamas.
[40:52.800 --> 40:54.840]  It's larger than that.
[40:54.840 --> 40:57.720]  It's the globalist running both states.
[40:57.720 --> 41:06.960]  It's the clash of civilizations that the PNAC documents from 2000 stated.
[41:06.960 --> 41:12.840]  The PNAC documents openly say in rebuilding America's defenses, it's declassified, you
[41:12.840 --> 41:13.840]  can go read it.
[41:13.840 --> 41:19.880]  About declassified, it's a governmental slash private think tank with Dick Cheney, the former
[41:19.880 --> 41:22.640]  Defense Secretary.
[41:22.640 --> 41:26.760]  He wasn't vice president yet when they wrote that, haunt showing it.
[41:26.760 --> 41:30.480]  And they said, we will fund the radical Muslims and we will fund the radicalization of the
[41:30.480 --> 41:31.480]  West against them.
[41:31.480 --> 41:38.640]  We'll have a clash of civilizations that basically brings down both systems into our control.
[41:38.640 --> 41:43.920]  The only lie was they said for America, Pax Americana.
[41:43.920 --> 41:45.680]  This is not Americana.
[41:45.680 --> 41:50.320]  The NSA spun on everything we do without warrants, the government coming after our guns, the
[41:50.320 --> 41:54.840]  borders being wide open, global government, tens of trillions in banker bailouts, the
[41:54.840 --> 42:02.600]  ultra rich exempt from taxation, using class warfare, brainwashing poor people to go after
[42:02.600 --> 42:13.680]  middle class people, their only ladder out of poverty, shutting down the ladders of success.
[42:13.680 --> 42:15.400]  Is that Pax Americana?
[42:15.400 --> 42:21.240]  No, 1776 worldwide is Pax Americana.
[42:21.240 --> 42:25.640]  And it's an idea of freedom and liberty.
[42:25.640 --> 42:33.000]  Never truly realized in this nation's experience, but just the partial realization was beautiful
[42:33.000 --> 42:37.000]  in the areas that we were able to embrace that.
[42:37.000 --> 42:42.760]  So that's where I stand on this whole front, ladies and gentlemen.
[42:42.760 --> 42:51.800]  And then there's this headline, Insider says intelligence agencies are running the government.
[42:51.800 --> 42:58.000]  That's his quote, William Benning.
[42:58.000 --> 43:05.040]  And the video, the entire interview from yesterday, 45 minutes long, is up on infowars.com.
[43:05.040 --> 43:10.400]  I'm going to re-tweet that right now when I go to break at real Alex Jones.
[43:10.400 --> 43:14.320]  Insider says intelligence agencies are running the government.
[43:14.320 --> 43:18.080]  When he said something lesser than that in the London Guardian, it was one of the biggest
[43:18.080 --> 43:20.240]  stories in the world for a couple of days.
[43:20.240 --> 43:24.120]  And we celebrated his honor, his courage here on this show.
[43:24.120 --> 43:30.280]  But then we have this subconscious, myself included, view where if we break something
[43:30.280 --> 43:34.560]  big, it doesn't even make the website, and I have to go and make sure it makes the website.
[43:34.560 --> 43:42.320]  I'm not complaining or throwing anybody under the bus, I'm bringing this up to point out
[43:42.320 --> 43:48.140]  the fact that we should all think of ourselves in the new media as important.
[43:48.140 --> 43:51.960]  We should all realize we've proven we're trying to tell the truth and that we know what we're
[43:51.960 --> 43:54.440]  talking about and that we've tapped into the zeitgeist.
[43:54.440 --> 43:56.280]  And if you're in the Liberty Movement, you're part of that.
[43:56.280 --> 43:57.280]  You've proven it.
[43:57.280 --> 44:01.240]  You've taken the ridicule and the attacks and been proven right.
[44:01.240 --> 44:07.240]  And so when we have the number four guy at the NSA on our show saying it's a total authoritarian
[44:07.240 --> 44:15.000]  criminal martial law takeover, blackmailing the whole government, that's sensational.
[44:15.000 --> 44:22.560]  And we, all of us and you, the listeners need to realize you may not get this for long if
[44:22.560 --> 44:28.680]  they stage a weaponized smallpox or weaponized airborne Ebola release that we know the Pentagon
[44:28.680 --> 44:32.560]  has been developing and other states have been developing.
[44:32.560 --> 44:36.560]  There have been articles out there in places like the Baltimore Sun with headlines, you
[44:36.560 --> 44:40.360]  know, breaking down the thousands of gallons of liquid death.
[44:40.360 --> 44:47.200]  And I remember that statement at these hundreds of bio weapons labs that they call bio shield,
[44:47.200 --> 44:54.160]  a decade long or now 13 year long program to build bio weapons labs in populated cities
[44:54.160 --> 44:59.440]  all over the United States that get around the weapons treaties by saying they're testing
[44:59.440 --> 45:05.400]  how to treat these weapons, but they're making these weapons.
[45:05.400 --> 45:09.960]  So what's going to happen if this stuff gets out?
[45:09.960 --> 45:13.160]  Will that be the crisis to bring in global governance and martial law?
[45:13.160 --> 45:15.600]  Is that why they're preparing?
[45:15.600 --> 45:19.480]  We should look at the West who's done all the secret experimentation and weaponizing
[45:19.480 --> 45:25.720]  of viruses and bacteria on record as prime suspects involved in the worst Ebola outbreak
[45:25.720 --> 45:26.720]  ever.
[45:26.720 --> 45:32.920]  And doctors and scientists and epidemiologists and virologists are saying that it looks like
[45:32.920 --> 45:35.640]  Ebola is getting stronger.
[45:35.640 --> 45:37.640]  It's mutating.
[45:37.640 --> 45:41.460]  And then we've got all these top globalists that go and hang out with Prince Charles dancing
[45:41.460 --> 45:47.760]  around making statements about soon the airborne Ebola will be out and 90% of you will die
[45:47.760 --> 45:56.160]  and I'm sad but it's best for the earth and it's for the new world order and for Lucifer.
[45:56.160 --> 46:02.440]  These are quotes by the way of major department heads.
[46:02.440 --> 46:08.040]  Scary enough that the FBI went and visited them when I threw a fit.
[46:08.040 --> 46:09.240]  So that says something for the FBI.
[46:09.240 --> 46:11.360]  I guess they love their kids.
[46:11.360 --> 46:19.120]  I guess you better look into biology department heads who talk like that because let me tell
[46:19.120 --> 46:20.120]  you something folks.
[46:20.120 --> 46:22.960]  They're gearing up for the organized collapse of civilization.
[46:22.960 --> 46:24.360]  Will it be World War III?
[46:24.360 --> 46:26.040]  Will it be global financial collapse?
[46:26.040 --> 46:29.320]  Will it be the purposeful shutting off of the power systems worldwide?
[46:29.320 --> 46:30.320]  It's all happening.
[46:30.320 --> 46:37.160]  The globalists are waging war against civilization except for compartmentalized breakaway civilization
[46:37.160 --> 46:41.360]  and grids that they control.
[46:41.360 --> 46:42.360]  That's a military tactic.
[46:42.360 --> 46:45.800]  Shut down your enemy's technology only you have it.
[46:45.800 --> 46:49.920]  No one will enter the new world order unless he or she will make a pledge to worship Lucifer.
[46:49.920 --> 46:55.160]  No one will enter the new age unless he will take a Luciferian initiation.
[46:55.160 --> 46:59.920]  David Spangler, American spiritual philosopher, author, considered one of the founding figures
[46:59.920 --> 47:02.360]  of the modern New Age movement.
[47:02.360 --> 47:10.200]  He said that in a publication of the Council on Foreign Relations in Congressional Testimony.
[47:10.200 --> 47:16.600]  By the way, I've been around these people.
[47:16.600 --> 47:17.760]  I'm not even going to tell people something.
[47:17.760 --> 47:18.760]  I'm not going to say it.
[47:18.760 --> 47:19.760]  It's too much.
[47:19.760 --> 47:24.520]  People can't even handle it.
[47:24.520 --> 47:28.640]  I saw that clip of that Mason one time that a Christian confronted about worshiping Lucifer
[47:28.640 --> 47:31.040]  and he goes, oh, sweet Lucifer.
[47:31.040 --> 47:42.400]  But I'll tell you at the top, they're, they're Luciferians folks, they're not devil worshipers.
[47:42.400 --> 47:46.400]  Big difference.
[47:46.400 --> 47:50.040]  And they think that they want to save the earth by wiping everybody out and you can
[47:50.040 --> 47:57.280]  look at what humans have become and the things we do and you could have that argument.
[47:57.280 --> 48:03.280]  But I want to take your phone calls.
[48:03.280 --> 48:06.360]  Let's go to your phone calls right now.
[48:06.360 --> 48:08.000]  Let's talk to Kevin and Mississippi.
[48:08.000 --> 48:09.000]  You're on the air.
[48:09.000 --> 48:10.000]  Welcome.
[48:10.000 --> 48:11.000]  Hello.
[48:11.000 --> 48:12.000]  Yes, sir.
[48:12.000 --> 48:15.000]  You want to talk, bro?
[48:15.000 --> 48:16.000]  Hell yeah.
[48:16.000 --> 48:17.000]  You want to talk, brother?
[48:17.000 --> 48:18.000]  Yeah, I want to talk.
[48:18.000 --> 48:19.000]  How are you doing, Alex?
[48:19.000 --> 48:20.000]  Good.
[48:20.000 --> 48:21.000]  Go ahead.
[48:21.000 --> 48:25.120]  I was wondering if the government going to do anything about stopping anybody from
[48:25.120 --> 48:29.120]  coming from Africa over to our country without Ebola disease or they're just going to let
[48:29.120 --> 48:32.480]  everybody jump on planes and come on over here so they can kill us all.
[48:32.480 --> 48:35.720]  Well, that would be racist if we stop someone with Ebola from coming over.
[48:35.720 --> 48:41.960]  Well, I mean, the main track to get any legally, if you can't get a visa, is you go to Mexico,
[48:41.960 --> 48:46.880]  you land and as long as you don't get off the bus, they don't stop you and know it's
[48:46.880 --> 48:53.200]  being predicted by virologist that if this outbreak of Ebola continues, it will come
[48:53.200 --> 48:54.480]  across the border.
[48:54.480 --> 48:59.360]  But again, Geraldo Rivera said that anything south of the border can't be criticized.
[48:59.360 --> 49:04.880]  If you were in Guatemala City and didn't like your beans and rice and fish, that would
[49:04.880 --> 49:06.040]  be racist.
[49:06.040 --> 49:12.120]  You just accept anything that, you know, I mean, if an alien spaceship landed in Mexico
[49:12.120 --> 49:16.040]  and flesh-eating goblins came off that were going to eat us, we would have to accept it
[49:16.040 --> 49:20.200]  because it originated in Mexico, sir.
[49:20.200 --> 49:22.160]  That was something I was wanting to ask you.
[49:22.160 --> 49:28.600]  Have y'all heard anything about the Chinese that has supposed to have bought the National
[49:28.600 --> 49:31.840]  DeSoto Forest over here in Mississippi?
[49:31.840 --> 49:37.720]  I know that, yes, Chinese firms are buying up giant swaths of public and private land
[49:37.720 --> 49:39.520]  all over the United States.
[49:39.520 --> 49:44.120]  They're basically state-run fronts and then they pay off the locals that don't follow
[49:44.120 --> 49:49.200]  any of the laws and operate as a mafia and they're arresting and taking the organs of
[49:49.200 --> 49:53.560]  Christians in China that was in the news yesterday and blowing up churches and taking
[49:53.560 --> 49:55.800]  down crosses on churches.
[49:55.800 --> 49:59.360]  But any criticism of that is anti-Asian.
[49:59.360 --> 50:03.480]  I thought I was criticizing authoritarianism, but again, if you criticize Hitler, it means
[50:03.480 --> 50:04.980]  you're anti-German.
[50:04.980 --> 50:09.200]  This is the new political correctness, so you just need to accept that, sir.
[50:09.200 --> 50:14.200]  Well, I don't criticize Hitler because I have a full understanding of why Hitler done
[50:14.200 --> 50:16.360]  what he done way back when.
[50:16.360 --> 50:21.000]  But that was then, and this is now, and what we got now is a real big problem with that
[50:21.000 --> 50:22.560]  border down there.
[50:22.560 --> 50:29.800]  What I want to know is why the Texans, New Mexico, the Californians going down there
[50:29.800 --> 50:32.120]  to put a stop to all that coming from the north.
[50:32.120 --> 50:33.720]  Well, you can go do it, sir.
[50:33.720 --> 50:39.320]  Listen, I've read Mein Kampf, have you read my struggle?
[50:39.320 --> 50:42.760]  Have you read my struggle?
[50:42.760 --> 50:46.480]  I was introduced to you by my son about seven months ago.
[50:46.480 --> 50:49.360]  Well, I'm glad you're tuning in, brother, but let me just explain something.
[50:49.360 --> 50:53.440]  What we've been told about Hitler in most history books is not accurate, but the real
[50:53.440 --> 50:59.440]  Hitler was a complete lunatic as well and was set up by British intelligence.
[50:59.440 --> 51:03.760]  Next to water and food, you need a safe, storable fuel supply for your preparedness
[51:03.760 --> 51:04.760]  needs.
[51:04.760 --> 51:06.960]  Spare fuel is the answer.
[51:06.960 --> 51:10.800]  Spare fuel can be used in any gas-powered vehicle or generator.
[51:10.800 --> 51:14.480]  Spare fuel is perfect for any unforeseen out-of-gas emergencies.
[51:14.480 --> 51:19.720]  Unlike gasoline, spare fuel is safe to store with your other supplies, and it can be stored
[51:19.720 --> 51:21.240]  for many years.
[51:21.240 --> 51:25.200]  Go to GetSpareFuel.com for special pricing.
[51:25.200 --> 51:27.200]  That's GetSpareFuel.com.
[51:27.200 --> 51:33.240]  Teenagers like me used to think our parents were just weird because they put their phones
[51:33.240 --> 51:36.240]  and computers inside those flimsy little fake leather cases.
[51:36.240 --> 51:38.920]  Then my folks both got a block at pocket.
[51:38.920 --> 51:41.880]  Mom knows it keeps her safe from the phone's radiation.
[51:41.880 --> 51:44.280]  Dad knows it keeps his information private.
[51:44.280 --> 51:47.600]  I like my block at pocket because it blocks hacking and tracking.
[51:47.600 --> 51:48.600]  Awesome.
[51:48.600 --> 51:50.920]  Blockitpocket.com has other cool stuff too.
[51:50.920 --> 51:53.320]  Huh, guess my parents aren't so weird.
[51:53.320 --> 51:55.920]  Get your block at pocket at blockitpocket.com.
[51:55.920 --> 52:01.040]  Hi folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.

[52:06.520 --> 52:10.320]  Two years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment, frustrated with the direction
[52:10.320 --> 52:14.760]  this country was headed, and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[52:14.760 --> 52:18.880]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[52:18.880 --> 52:22.880]  MyPatriotSupply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[52:22.880 --> 52:28.160]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hardworking American men
[52:28.160 --> 52:29.160]  and women.

[57:00.400 --> 57:03.400]  Again, we could have done any of this without you.
[57:03.400 --> 57:06.400]  Let's talk to Jay in Texas.
[57:06.400 --> 57:09.400]  What do you think the next big crisis is going to be?
[57:09.400 --> 57:18.440]  manufactured crises. What do you think? Alex, you know, I got to say, you know, this, we didn't
[57:18.440 --> 57:25.960]  have a warning back in 2001 when we had the towers taken down, but of course in an inside job, but
[57:25.960 --> 57:32.920]  I think that we're heading, we're heading that way in some way, some sort, you know, the war
[57:33.480 --> 57:38.600]  and the Middle East, and then we have war in Russia and Ukraine, you know, it leaves us out.
[57:38.600 --> 57:43.640]  I mean, the U.S. is never out of a war regardless, you know, what stand this. So I think we're
[57:43.640 --> 57:49.000]  going to have to blackmail something, someone's going to get blackmailed, something's going to
[57:49.000 --> 57:54.920]  happen and we're going to get involved and I'm afraid it's going to be a inside job here and in
[57:54.920 --> 58:01.160]  our United States, you know, in our country. Well, I agree with you because you notice that
[58:01.160 --> 58:06.040]  Obama keeps saying I'm worried about just someone nuking Manhattan. I'm not going to say who,
[58:06.040 --> 58:12.200]  but then you look at the movies and what they're pre-programming, it's patriots linking up with
[58:12.200 --> 58:18.200]  radical Muslims to then blame us for it. Like U.S. Army was anti-Obama detonated the nuke in
[58:18.200 --> 58:22.920]  New York City or in D.C. And really it'll be the globalists to bring in their hard coup.
[58:23.560 --> 58:27.800]  And I'm telling you, all the Homeland Security preparations folks are for a takeoff.
[58:28.840 --> 58:34.360]  Our ace in the hole is the average Homeland Security person is actually awake. I've been
[58:34.360 --> 58:39.480]  amazed that the globalists have a real problem on their hands. We'll be back. Stay with us.
[58:39.480 --> 58:45.240]  Thank you for the secret service. A lot of them are awake. Most militaries awake.
[58:45.240 --> 58:47.080]  Most local police are starting to wake up.
[58:48.920 --> 58:54.040]  This is Alex Jones for InfoWarsLife.com. The latest in preparedness is now here,
[58:54.040 --> 58:58.200]  an electrically stabilized colloidal silver solution that can be added to both your home
[58:58.200 --> 59:03.560]  cabinet and preparedness pack alike. Concentrated to 30 parts per million and what has been dubbed
[59:03.560 --> 59:09.240]  the survival silver solution. The new InfoWarsLife silver bullet colloidal silver is the answer

[1:00:41.960 --> 1:00:52.760]  are the globalist moving on every front just to destabilize the world? Well yes obviously but
[1:00:52.760 --> 1:00:58.520]  towards one end and if you've got them staging al-Qaeda, ISIS takeovers, destabilizing countries
[1:00:58.520 --> 1:01:06.680]  overthrowing them, destabilizing Africa, the Middle East, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, the Ukraine

[1:01:12.920 --> 1:01:18.920]  economy. What's the next big shoe to drop? This Ebola thing is very suspicious. We know the U.S.
