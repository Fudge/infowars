[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  About one stillbirth every two months is the usual rate, so to suddenly get to 86 stillbirth
[00:28.000 --> 00:34.000]  in six months, that's highly unusual. But the confirmation, the most important confirmation
[00:34.000 --> 00:43.000]  that we have from the Waterloo Ontario report was that all of the 86 stillbirths were fully
[00:43.000 --> 00:49.000]  vaccinated. Health Minister questioned about reported explosion in fully vaccinated mothers
[00:49.000 --> 00:54.000]  experiencing stillbirths. But here's the kicker. Mothers of stillbirth babies were fully vaccinated
[00:54.000 --> 01:00.000]  and you have clearly said on numerous occasions that the vaccines are safe. So Minister, what
[01:00.000 --> 01:05.000]  do you say to the doctors who told expecting women it was important to get fully vaccinated
[01:05.000 --> 01:11.000]  and what should they tell the mothers who deliver a stillborn baby? We are recommending that women
[01:11.000 --> 01:16.000]  who are pregnant do receive the vaccine for the protection of themselves, protection of their
[01:16.000 --> 01:23.000]  baby as well. It has been accepted by the Health Canada, by the World Health Organization,
[01:23.000 --> 01:30.000]  by the FDA. Women who are pregnant is entirely safe and recommended for them to receive the vaccine.
[01:30.000 --> 01:34.000]  Until about ten years ago, every major government in the world said a pregnant woman should never
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.000]  take a vaccine because it can cause an autoimmune response and make the woman reject the baby.
[01:38.000 --> 01:42.000]  A number of hospitals around the country are denying organ transplants of people who are
[01:42.000 --> 01:47.000]  not vaccinated against COVID-19 or bumping them down on waiting lists. This raises some ethical
[01:47.000 --> 01:52.000]  questions over the decisions. In one highly publicized case, a Colorado health system denied
[01:52.000 --> 01:59.000]  the woman a kidney transplant. The patient refuses to get a COVID shot. So there's this
[01:59.000 --> 02:06.000]  policy put in place for something that could happen versus not getting a transplant which
[02:06.000 --> 02:16.000]  could 100% lead to the end of my life. Traveling nurses triple salaries as hospitals struggle
[02:16.000 --> 02:22.000]  with the national staffing crisis. The hospitals are struggling, they're having to call in the
[02:22.000 --> 02:28.000]  National Guard because they fired the uninjected. But it is true what CNN says, because I've
[02:28.000 --> 02:33.000]  looked at the actual numbers and called hospitals, they are full of people dying who are the
[02:33.000 --> 02:38.000]  vaccinated. And that's confirmed from Israel to the UK to the United States to Canada to
[02:38.000 --> 02:44.000]  Australia. We've got one more state to get through that gate. It's a bit like getting
[02:44.000 --> 02:48.000]  a seat through the gate and into the room. I would recommend that instead of Christmas
[02:48.000 --> 02:57.000]  shopping, everyone shops for a COVID booster online or reaches out to their partner to
[02:57.000 --> 03:04.000]  make them an appointment to go online for a COVID shot. And that is the best exciting
[03:04.000 --> 03:12.000]  gift that can be given. It's mind blowing to see them on the news saying if you've had
[03:12.000 --> 03:16.000]  the shot you're protected, that's why people that don't have the shot are going to infect
[03:16.000 --> 03:23.000]  you. For unvaccinated, we are looking at a winner of severe illness and death. Unvaccinated
[03:23.000 --> 03:30.000]  for themselves, their families, and the hospitals they'll soon overwhelm. But there's good news.
[03:30.000 --> 03:34.000]  If you're vaccinated, you have your booster shot, you're protected from severe illness
[03:34.000 --> 03:40.000]  and death. Omicron is here. It's going to start to spread much more rapidly in the beginning
[03:40.000 --> 03:47.000]  of the year. And the only real protection is to get your shots. If you get one shot,
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.000]  if you haven't gotten it yet, that'll help. If you're the point where you have everything,
[03:51.000 --> 03:56.000]  including your booster, you're in really good shape. Why is President Biden telling people
[03:56.000 --> 04:02.000]  still that the vaccinated cannot spread COVID? Can you say more? Yeah, in a local interview
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  on Tuesday he said how about making sure you're vaccinated so you do not spread the disease
[04:06.000 --> 04:13.000]  to anybody else. The CDC says people who get vaccine breakthrough infections can be contagious.
[04:13.000 --> 04:18.000]  Well, I'll say this. I didn't hear this interview, so I would have to see it in its full context.
[04:18.000 --> 04:22.000]  What I know and what the President believes is that we have to listen to the science,
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  we have to listen to our public health officials, and that's what the President believes.
[04:25.000 --> 04:29.000]  Immunity means your body knows how to beat it. It doesn't matter if somebody's got it
[04:29.000 --> 04:34.000]  next to you. That's 100%. That's facts. That's science. That's reality. But at the end of
[04:34.000 --> 04:39.000]  the day, folks, the entire thrust of the takeover is this medical tyranny with a medical ID
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  for the medical social credit score, the carbon tax, and they get that in place, and it's
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  going in place all over the world right now. We are now inside the mark of the beast.
[04:49.000 --> 04:53.000]  So have you ever wondered how is the devil, how is this world government he runs going
[04:53.000 --> 05:05.000]  to get everybody to do this? And now you know. Everything I do. This could be in full wars
[05:05.000 --> 05:11.000]  last Christmas because it could be America's last Christmas. Evil is taking over the planet.
[05:11.000 --> 05:16.000]  They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies.
[05:16.000 --> 05:21.000]  They're coming after us. And if we don't support American businesses and if we don't support
[05:21.000 --> 05:28.000]  media in the final days of 2021, we have no future in the midterms in 2022. 2022 is the
[05:28.000 --> 05:33.000]  year where America decides its fate. I want to thank you all for your support. I want
[05:33.000 --> 05:37.000]  to encourage you to your Christmas shopping. Then for store.com because I can barely keep
[05:37.000 --> 05:42.000]  our operation going. And I appreciate you keeping us in the position to fight back.

[06:02.000 --> 06:25.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. It's Friday, December 17th.
[06:25.000 --> 06:33.000]  The year is 2021. I am your host Alex Jones. Well, it's now all out in the open. Joe Biden
[06:33.000 --> 06:37.000]  came out with his incredible threat, saying it's going to be a dark winter of death and
[06:37.000 --> 06:43.000]  destruction for the quote, unvaccinated, but you will be safe. If you take the shot, literally
[06:43.000 --> 06:48.000]  terrorizing you to take something that by the third injection with the Pfizer by the
[06:48.000 --> 06:55.000]  second with the Moderna, a racist 90 plus percent of your immune system turning off your killer
[06:55.000 --> 07:05.000]  T cells. Unbelievable. We'll play the clip in a moment. But today is definitely the day
[07:05.000 --> 07:10.000]  that the most news ever about this being a depopulation rollout takeover, both the virus
[07:10.000 --> 07:15.000]  and the response with the vaccines, the deliberate suppression of therapeutics that are
[07:15.000 --> 07:21.000]  basically 100% of you get them early. The attack on vitamin D, vitamin C, zinc. We are
[07:21.000 --> 07:27.000]  witnessing the criminal global corporations through the UN and through our nation states
[07:27.000 --> 07:35.000]  that they've captured, literally engaged in 21st century warfare against the people.
[07:35.000 --> 07:45.000]  Caz writing on Twitter said the conspiracy theorist warned us about and warned us last year of
[07:45.000 --> 07:51.000]  vaccine mandates, vaccine passports, perpetual lockdowns, rampant inflation. So the conspiracy
[07:51.000 --> 07:58.000]  theorist warns you of all those things. Now they're warning you of digital ID, social credit
[07:58.000 --> 08:06.000]  bank digital currencies, climate lockdowns, energy rationing, pay attention. Electricity
[08:06.000 --> 08:14.000]  this year alone is up over 26%. It's gone up 17% in the Dallas, Fort Worth area in just
[08:14.000 --> 08:22.000]  the last month on top of that. Got that the stack. And then these headlines out of Austria
[08:22.000 --> 08:29.000]  and Germany, Austria to begin shipping unvaxxed to prisons. Oh, then we found wired magazine
[08:29.000 --> 08:37.000]  last year in March, attacking yours truly saying I'm an insane devil liar. First saying
[08:37.000 --> 08:42.000]  by next winter they'll be announcing new lockdowns and forced inoculation in the imprisonment
[08:42.000 --> 08:48.000]  of the unvaxxed in Europe and Australia because they're the testbeds. And then a year later
[08:48.000 --> 08:55.000]  yes, that'll be by the midterms 10 months from now. But now it starts in Germany and Australia
[08:55.000 --> 09:01.000]  and then we're a little less than a year out from them trying to basically stop the midterms
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.000]  around such a smoke screen of political collapse with the economy and cyber attacks and all
[09:07.000 --> 09:15.000]  the rest of it that they're able to smoke screen stealing the election in 326 days. This is
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  unbelievable, ladies and gentlemen, let me show you the news today. Turns out what we
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  told you, of course, 20 plus months ago was true. We had all the documents then that Peter
[09:24.000 --> 09:29.000]  Dazik, who also goes to eugenics conferences with Bill Gates and talks about how he wants
[09:29.000 --> 09:36.000]  to depopulate you and your family. Peter Dazik ran the Lancet Journal and had them lie and
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  say that there was no gain of function going on and Lancet knew and helped cover up criminally.
[09:42.000 --> 09:50.000]  That's out of the news today, but wait, it gets 10 times bigger. Are you ready for this one?
[09:50.000 --> 10:02.000]  CDC warns Americans not to get J&J shot, period, over blood clot risk. J&J fires another virus,
[10:02.000 --> 10:09.000]  it's a virus vector system, almost as dangerous as mRNA, into your cells and makes them produce
[10:09.000 --> 10:19.000]  that protein, which is toxic and turns off your killer T's. Some evidence shows it's
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  even stronger than the Moderna and the Pfizer in its effects. That's the same thing. And
[10:25.000 --> 10:34.000]  it changes your DNA big time. Fires a combination of a human and a chimpanzee virus into your
[10:34.000 --> 10:42.000]  cells. That sound good? No. Carrying a payload with it that does the same thing as the mRNA.
[10:42.000 --> 10:48.000]  Same message. Dazik and Gates produced all these at the Wuhan lab the last 10 years and
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.000]  then they in November and December of 2019 sent the orders out to all the major western
[10:55.000 --> 11:01.000]  vaccine makers that they had the patents and that they owned them. Bill Gates, Fauci, Peter
[11:01.000 --> 11:08.000]  Dink, on record, this is on record, to prepare to make the vaccine for this spike protein
[11:08.000 --> 11:16.000]  that is the same spike protein from HIV that, wait for it, that Dr. Anthony Fauci with Bill
[11:16.000 --> 11:29.000]  Gates co-owns. Co-owns. And they always had this plan to have a bunch of the same type
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  of vaccines out there that aren't vaccines. And so that when you got upset about it, they
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.000]  go, okay, we pulled one off. That's in the SPARS 2023 document that's really set in the
[11:39.000 --> 11:48.000]  year 2020 to 2023. This is the martial law takeover of the planet in their own words.
[11:48.000 --> 11:54.000]  So here it is from zero hedge.com. It's on info wars.com. CDC warns Americans not to
[11:54.000 --> 12:03.000]  get a J&J shot over blood clot. Goes on to say that it should be pulled from the market.
[12:03.000 --> 12:09.000]  Wow, not getting a lot of attention. It gets worse. School district in New York sends out
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  email. This is on info wars.com. Gateway abundant also has it. School district in New York sends
[12:14.000 --> 12:21.000]  out email warning parents of sudden cardiac arrest and students from fifth grade to 12th
[12:21.000 --> 12:25.000]  grade. And they just say, don't worry, we've got defibrillators and everything ready. And
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.000]  there's just going to be a lot more heart attacks. Just get used to it. And then it gets worse.
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  Reuters. Remember how much I harped on this? The UN won't sign the secret agreement with
[12:37.000 --> 12:41.000]  Pfizer to give liability protection to them in Moderna. So that's why they will not inject
[12:41.000 --> 12:45.000]  anyone that is a, quote, refugee they're bringing in because they set up strokes and heart
[12:45.000 --> 12:51.000]  attacks and that it will scare refugees from not coming. So you're being targeted as a
[12:51.000 --> 12:56.000]  police officer or a school teacher or a person that works at a grocery store or a farmer
[12:56.000 --> 13:01.000]  or a five-year-old child trying to go to school or a woman that wants to go into Cheesecake
[13:01.000 --> 13:07.000]  Factory and eat with her family. You're going to be arrested. But if you want to come across,
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.000]  that's okay. And the UN is not going to do it because, well, they're not going to give
[13:11.000 --> 13:16.000]  themselves any liability. And that's all the secret documents and admissions. Pfizer has
[13:16.000 --> 13:25.000]  power to, quote, silence governments. That's ABC News. Silence governments in secret agreements.
[13:25.000 --> 13:33.000]  Now you start to see global corporate coup. Alex Jones was not engaged in hyperbole on
[13:33.000 --> 13:37.000]  any of this. I'm telling you exactly what's going down. And now they've got all their
[13:37.000 --> 13:41.000]  talking heads across the world saying forced injections are coming to Europe, the United
[13:41.000 --> 13:45.000]  States and Australia. And I told you months ago with all them preparing that, that's like
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  artillery opening up before the ground forces move in, that they would start announcing
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  the force inoculations first in Europe, then Australia, then the UK, then Canada, then the
[13:54.000 --> 14:01.000]  US. It's now started exactly as I said, precisely. They found the video, I've got to send it
[14:01.000 --> 14:07.000]  to the crew. It's on Twitter. 21 months ago, I said, you'll start having weather reports
[14:07.000 --> 14:12.000]  on the viruses and whether you can go out or not on your apps. It's now been announced
[14:12.000 --> 14:17.000]  by CNN that it will be a weather like app and will tell you where you can go and what you
[14:17.000 --> 14:22.000]  can do and that this is with us forever. And it's going to be like storms, like tornadoes,
[14:22.000 --> 14:26.000]  like hurricanes. Told you, I've got the enemy. I didn't read that in the document. I just
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  know them. I just am inside their head. And of course, now billboards all over the western
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.000]  world that it's normal for children to have heart attacks and strokes and die. So it's
[14:37.000 --> 14:41.000]  on, ladies and gentlemen, you know, the weather channel now is bringing localized COVID-19
[14:41.000 --> 14:48.000]  updates to your phone, total BS. And it gets worse. Refugees lack COVID shots because
[14:48.000 --> 14:55.000]  drug makers fear lawsuits document show Reuters. Oh, and what are the Reuters articles say
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  last week about, oh, the first 30-something pages of the hundreds of thousands that Pfizer
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  released to the FDA after the federal court ordered it? It's just massive deaths and
[15:03.000 --> 15:07.000]  miscarriages they covered up in line with the public. And now they're just normalizing
[15:07.000 --> 15:11.000]  killing you, you see? It's all coming out. They're not even getting in trouble. And in the
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  SPARS document from 2018, they talk about with John Hopkins and the Rockefeller Foundation
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  how they're going to normalize killing you and how you're going to take it and how you're
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  going to like it. And oh, the parents get all the attention when their kid has a stroke
[15:26.000 --> 15:31.000]  or a heart attack and they get to go bury him. And it's so much fun. It's so liberal
[15:31.000 --> 15:35.000]  and cool. It's almost as good as, you know, the sexual sterilization of the children and
[15:35.000 --> 15:42.000]  all the chemical castration. It's so liberal. And it gets worse. Oh, I haven't even, oh,
[15:42.000 --> 15:48.000]  it gets even worse, way worse when we come back. But it's all coming out, how they're
[15:48.000 --> 15:51.000]  burying you and your family, and then big techs working around the clock to suppress
[15:51.000 --> 15:59.000]  any of this getting out, which makes them accomplices to murder one.
[15:59.000 --> 16:00.000]  If you're concerned about the...
[16:00.000 --> 16:07.000]  Everything I do is about victory for humanity. Everything I promote is about standing up
[16:07.000 --> 16:12.000]  against the new world order by empowering humanity. Well, that's why resetwars.com is so important.

[18:12.000 --> 18:17.000]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide. Now, ladies and gentlemen,

[18:26.000 --> 18:31.000]  relationship with God. But now more than ever, you need to get your storable food orders

[18:40.000 --> 18:45.000]  more food supply shortages and you're going to see food supply price increases that are
[18:45.000 --> 18:49.000]  already taking place. So lock in your storable food now at a lower price and fund the info
[18:49.000 --> 18:55.000]  war at infowarstore.com. That's how you fight the great reset is by being self-sufficient
[18:55.000 --> 19:00.000]  and not under their control. So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.000]  I'm saying they're going to decide when you can travel and when you can't travel and
[19:29.000 --> 19:33.000]  MasterCard and then all the other big companies are currently announcing that
[19:33.000 --> 19:38.000]  they're going to track what you do and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it.
[19:38.000 --> 19:43.000]  This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen. This is the takeover.
[19:43.000 --> 19:47.000]  If humanity better wake up and say no. Finally, folks are starting to wake up.
[19:47.000 --> 19:51.000]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, others will leave the charts along with info wars, but it's not
[19:51.000 --> 19:56.000]  every individual has to not comply. We have to talk about bringing the globalist to justice.
[19:56.000 --> 20:22.000]  You see, they need the fear of God put in them legally and lawfully.
[20:26.000 --> 20:46.000]  Yeah, it's Klaus Schwab in the great reset. Taking down the evil humans.
[20:46.000 --> 20:52.000]  He is the Avenger. He is the destroyer.
[20:52.000 --> 20:57.000]  You know, here's what I'm going to do. I'm not going to get into the incredible injection news
[20:57.000 --> 21:00.000]  that already started hitting this segment. I'm going to do it next segment.
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  I'm going to ask you to tell everybody, you know, on the local radio station you're listening to
[21:04.000 --> 21:10.000]  or with the links at info wars.com forward slash show or with today's live show headline
[21:10.000 --> 21:16.000]  to join us now and be warned and understand what's happening and be part of the solution
[21:16.000 --> 21:25.000]  in the mass awakening. Friday bomb show. CDC warns Americans not to take COVID jab while
[21:25.000 --> 21:35.000]  UN bans COVID facts for migrants over liability fears. Wow. Meanwhile, a New York school district
[21:35.000 --> 21:45.000]  has sent out a mass email warning parents of sudden cardiac arrest in their students.
[21:45.000 --> 21:50.000]  In fact, it's the major New York school district. Pretty incredible information.
[21:50.000 --> 21:53.000]  I mean, I think that's red alert, red alert, red alert territory, isn't it?
[21:53.000 --> 21:58.000]  Because I say right beneath that red alert, red alert, red alert.
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000]  The globalist house of cards is coming down. You do not want to miss this bombshell Friday edition
[22:03.000 --> 22:08.000]  of the Alex Jones show because they're not going to give up. You understand that.
[22:08.000 --> 22:10.000]  We were getting popular selected all over the world.
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  We were building a pro human future just five years ago and they've counter struck with their
[22:14.000 --> 22:24.000]  operation lockstep crimson contagion dark winter spars 2023 operation.
[22:24.000 --> 22:31.000]  That's how I know exactly when they're going to do it and how they're going to do it because it's a program.
[22:31.000 --> 22:37.000]  I've got a vice article here that I mentioned that I've got to take time out today to at least show you part of.
[22:37.000 --> 22:44.000]  Or I'll show you the headline. You go read it yourself. It's a long 20 page article demonizing myself and many others saying the
[22:44.000 --> 22:49.000]  insane conspiracy theorists claim forced inoculations are coming.
[22:49.000 --> 22:52.000]  They claim by next year they'll claim there's new variants.
[22:52.000 --> 23:00.000]  You've got to take all these new boosters and they're going to force you how insane are these scum.
[23:00.000 --> 23:02.000]  And of course, it hasn't aged well that clip.
[23:02.000 --> 23:08.000]  That's why they're now censoring on Twitter and Instagram confirmed clips of Fauci on TV.
[23:08.000 --> 23:17.000]  Again, 18 months ago saying we got to be careful about the new vaccine that it doesn't cause A.D.E.
[23:17.000 --> 23:25.000]  antibody dependency enhancement, which tends to kill you open.
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  Oh, you're not allowed to say that now.
[23:26.000 --> 23:28.000]  So even he's memory hold.
[23:28.000 --> 23:33.000]  I mean, he's the good Fauci. So we're not allowed to hear what he said a year and a half ago.
[23:33.000 --> 23:36.000]  We're only allowed to hear what he says now.
[23:36.000 --> 23:39.000]  You can't show him saying masks don't work a year and a half ago.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  You just have him saying where to.
[23:41.000 --> 23:47.000]  And by the way, even if you're by yourself in your home where one and test yourself on Christmas, that's what he said yesterday.
[23:47.000 --> 23:52.000]  Literal cult programming.
[23:52.000 --> 24:01.000]  Oh, and the CDC's quietly announced in the UK's announced Australia's announced New Zealand's announced in Germany's announced Spain's announced.
[24:01.000 --> 24:08.000]  That we're never going back to normal and the lockdowns permanent and you're always going to get new shots three or four a year up to 70 year up to 10 a year.
[24:08.000 --> 24:13.000]  And then they laugh at you and say, but you can have an orgy with 25 people.
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  By the way, if you're a new listener, I'm not joking.
[24:15.000 --> 24:23.000]  The same people said, don't look at the sunset and don't talk to your neighbors, but you can have sex with 25 people in orgy.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  By the way, every new listener, that's not a joke.
[24:25.000 --> 24:30.000]  The Prime Minister of New Zealand said that two days ago, he didn't even rate for us to play it.
[24:30.000 --> 24:31.000]  Yeah, there it is.
[24:31.000 --> 24:38.000]  Didn't even rate for us to play it in the sea of evil going on.
[24:38.000 --> 24:44.000]  Speaking of pedophilia, they busted more people trafficking or trying to traffic children, more CNN producers trafficking children.
[24:44.000 --> 24:46.000]  Hey, newsflash.
[24:46.000 --> 24:52.000]  I mean, folks, I'm not kidding when I said last week when the other CNN news broke that a large number of their producers are pedophiles.
[24:52.000 --> 24:54.000]  I mean, that's well known.
[24:54.000 --> 24:59.000]  You don't get the job unless you're a sick, evil person at CNN.
[24:59.000 --> 25:04.000]  And so they don't vouch for you unless you're pretty sick.
[25:04.000 --> 25:07.000]  So when you see CNN host, you see CNN crew.
[25:07.000 --> 25:12.000]  I mean, I'm not saying that as a joke when I tell you that you're dealing with the Legion of Satan.
[25:12.000 --> 25:17.000]  I mean, that is a satanic command base, mothership.
[25:17.000 --> 25:25.000]  The founder of it literally wants to murder you and your family and kill seven plus billion people.
[25:25.000 --> 25:28.000]  So just understand you keep wondering why this is happening.
[25:28.000 --> 25:32.000]  They want to murder you, but let me let me speak to this.
[25:32.000 --> 25:34.000]  I was sitting here thinking about friends and family.
[25:34.000 --> 25:41.000]  I know that are aware of the globalist and aware of the takeover, but they're so selfish.
[25:41.000 --> 25:46.000]  Even friends and family have known for a long time, some of them, that they can't get upset about this
[25:46.000 --> 25:51.000]  because they've got a life to lead and they'll just go through whatever hoops they've got to jump through
[25:51.000 --> 25:57.000]  to just continue to watch their Netflix and hang out with their friends and drink beer.
[25:57.000 --> 26:02.000]  So that makes these people literally aiding and abetting the globalist.
[26:02.000 --> 26:06.000]  And I was asking myself, what is the common denominator of these people?
[26:06.000 --> 26:07.000]  They're in a trance.
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  They were born into comfort.
[26:09.000 --> 26:13.000]  They were born into things being pretty tranquil and safe.
[26:13.000 --> 26:22.000]  And so they just don't get how they're going to lose their future and their laissez-faire lifestyle very soon because they're selfish.
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  And when you get a bunch of selfish people who don't care about themselves, don't care about others,
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.000]  the whole society degenerates and the whole society begins to collapse in rapid order.
[26:32.000 --> 26:38.000]  And medically, much of the Western world from watching so much television and screen time
[26:38.000 --> 26:45.000]  and the flicker rate is in a close to sleep state, a daydreaming state, highly suggestible.
[26:45.000 --> 26:46.000]  That's mainline science.
[26:46.000 --> 26:49.000]  And that's what we cover in Reset Wars.
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  And so you're already awake.
[26:51.000 --> 26:54.000]  The listeners of this broadcast are more awake than I am anyways.
[26:54.000 --> 27:02.000]  So for you, it's something to learn the technicals of because you're already basically somewhat immune to the mind control.
[27:02.000 --> 27:03.000]  None of us are perfect.
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.000]  And so you need to go see Reset Wars to share it with other people.
[27:07.000 --> 27:11.000]  And you know, I'm going to talk to some of my members of family who don't take stuff serious enough
[27:11.000 --> 27:17.000]  and I'm going to make them watch Reset Wars or I'm going to disassociate from them in general.
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.000]  Because society is going down and people need to choose a side to really fight this.
[27:22.000 --> 27:27.000]  And we need to, you know, the left bullies everybody to submit to their agenda.
[27:27.000 --> 27:32.000]  We need to not bully people, but we need to say, hey, you better choose what sides you're on in this thing.
[27:32.000 --> 27:37.000]  So I am so proud of Reset Wars and I'm so thankful to the listeners that have gone and gotten the course.
[27:37.000 --> 27:40.000]  And we've seen some complaints because it's $200.
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  And my answer to you is we need the money to stay on air and build a whole new infrastructure, which we're doing.
[27:45.000 --> 27:48.000]  And we need the money to do this.
[27:48.000 --> 27:54.000]  People go pay thousands of dollars for George Strait tickets or for, you know, NFL tickets or basketball tickets in the front row.
[27:54.000 --> 27:56.000]  This is a couple hundred dollars.
[27:56.000 --> 28:01.000]  We're not cutting in here with the supplement sales and t-shirts and the rest of it.
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  And I'm not complaining at our listeners that support us.
[28:03.000 --> 28:04.000]  You know who you are.
[28:04.000 --> 28:08.000]  But for people on the fence, you need the information in Reset Wars.
[28:08.000 --> 28:09.000]  This is game changing.
[28:09.000 --> 28:10.000]  I mean, what do you think I do?
[28:10.000 --> 28:11.000]  All I do is game change.
[28:11.000 --> 28:12.000]  I'm not bragging.
[28:12.000 --> 28:14.000]  I know what I'm talking about.
[28:14.000 --> 28:16.000]  You need Reset Wars.
[28:16.000 --> 28:21.000]  But regardless, if you're a regular listener that's already really awake, you will still be helped by it.
[28:21.000 --> 28:22.000]  It's very powerful.
[28:22.000 --> 28:23.000]  It's a lot to absorb.
[28:23.000 --> 28:28.000]  Very, very deep information, but also very simple at one level.
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  So I hope everybody goes to ResetWars.com.
[28:31.000 --> 28:36.000]  We've had just rave reviews, but we have had a lot of complaints that we only did three days of the 25% off.
[28:36.000 --> 28:41.000]  And so the 25% off is brought back for the Christmas sale through Christmas Day.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  And then it's going to go back to its regular price.
[28:43.000 --> 28:49.000]  We're going to launch a bunch of other courses that are less and a whole bunch of other special events and things.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  But we had to have this to build the infrastructure.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  And you're the founders by being members at ResetWars.com.
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  You're helping found the next level of the InfoWars. So thank you.
[28:58.000 --> 29:27.000]  Hey, everybody.
[29:28.000 --> 29:43.000]  Welcome to ResetWars.com.
[29:43.000 --> 30:03.000]  I never compromise the quality of ingredients we put in InfoWars live products.
[30:03.000 --> 30:07.000]  And that's why for more than two years we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[30:07.000 --> 30:14.000]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now. And we have reformulated and not just used the same ingredients.
[30:14.000 --> 30:17.000]  We've boosted it and made them even stronger.
[30:17.000 --> 30:21.000]  So out of all the bone broths out there, I'm telling you, this is next level.
[30:21.000 --> 30:22.000]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[30:22.000 --> 30:27.000]  Cutting-edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.
[30:27.000 --> 30:32.000]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen, goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[30:32.000 --> 30:37.000]  and a bunch of other amazing known berries that turbo charge your body with antioxidants.
[30:37.000 --> 30:41.000]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things like magnesium, potassium, and sodium added.
[30:41.000 --> 30:43.000]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[30:43.000 --> 30:49.000]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[30:49.000 --> 30:50.000]  And it just goes on and on.
[30:50.000 --> 30:59.000]  It is now back in stock, Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, available at 20% off and free shipping out of the gates at InfoWarsStore.com.
[30:59.000 --> 31:03.000]  Get our great bag of it here.
[31:03.000 --> 31:08.000]  I mean, this is from, people say, why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[31:08.000 --> 31:14.000]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[31:14.000 --> 31:15.000]  better than Guatemalan coffee.
[31:15.000 --> 31:19.000]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know, the media calls communists,
[31:19.000 --> 31:20.000]  but really they're just a commune.
[31:20.000 --> 31:23.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee and we've got it.
[31:23.000 --> 31:25.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[31:25.000 --> 31:30.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years and the price has never gone up.
[31:30.000 --> 31:34.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name for about 50% more per pound.
[31:34.000 --> 31:37.000]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee you're going to find anywhere.
[31:37.000 --> 31:41.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels, literally.
[31:41.000 --> 31:46.000]  In fact, I'm not going to tell you a little story.
[31:46.000 --> 31:47.000]  We had like that.
[31:47.000 --> 31:48.000]  You wouldn't believe it.
[31:48.000 --> 31:53.000]  Anyway, so it's InfoWarsStore.com and that's how we fund this operation.
[31:53.000 --> 31:55.000]  And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[32:23.000 --> 32:24.000]  It's all crashing down.
[32:24.000 --> 32:28.000]  Is it time to just move out to the woods, just time to go get a piece of property in the woods
[32:28.000 --> 32:32.000]  and just get off grid, just get the emergency food supplies, just live off the land?
[32:32.000 --> 32:33.000]  That's the survival instinct.
[32:33.000 --> 32:37.000]  But see, the worldly part of me that's still probably the majority part of me says,
[32:37.000 --> 32:38.000]  no, no, no, no, no.
[32:38.000 --> 32:39.000]  Stay in the city.
[32:39.000 --> 32:44.000]  The survival instinct says, get the hell out of anywhere there's ever notion that you need to get a vaccine or a mask.
[32:44.000 --> 32:50.000]  That's the internal struggle that my guess is a lot of you in the audience are facing as well.
[32:50.000 --> 32:55.000]  But you can at least have some comfort if you have the emergency food supplies.
[32:55.000 --> 33:21.000]  And so we have the best ones at InfoWarsStore.com.
[33:25.000 --> 33:36.000]  The globalist cult is so sick.
[33:36.000 --> 33:42.000]  The top brass are almost all New World Order now and they have Congressional Medal of Honor events.
[33:42.000 --> 33:47.000]  Something Obama suspended because he didn't want the country to be patriotic.
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  But now the globalists have full control.
[33:49.000 --> 33:55.000]  They are wrapping themselves in the flag and the valor of our history and our troops.
[33:55.000 --> 33:56.000]  And it's truly disgusting.
[33:56.000 --> 34:01.000]  And I've got a stack of news on that front of what they're now teaching officially,
[34:01.000 --> 34:08.000]  critical race theory and beyond inside all four branches or five branches now of the U.S. military.
[34:08.000 --> 34:17.000]  So that's a whole stack I've got that I'm going to hit coming up the start of the next hour.
[34:17.000 --> 34:22.000]  And we have a special guest, Michael Reardon, who is a friend of mine.
[34:22.000 --> 34:25.000]  And I talked him into coming on the show.
[34:25.000 --> 34:33.000]  So he's just really super smart with the smartest people I know about human nature.
[34:33.000 --> 34:39.000]  And I wanted to get him on months and months and months ago.
[34:39.000 --> 34:45.000]  And he said, well, when your reset wars comes out, that's what I want to speak about
[34:45.000 --> 34:49.000]  because we talked about the concepts and the ideas and he agreed with them,
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  but had really articulate ways to talk about it.
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  And it's not going to be a pitch for reset wars.
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  That's just when he wanted to come on.
[34:55.000 --> 34:59.000]  And so hopefully you'll be hearing more from Mr. Reardon here on the show
[34:59.000 --> 35:06.000]  because he really is a sage individual.
[35:06.000 --> 35:12.000]  And I've got other friends that I'd like to try to get on air that don't want to be public that are just as smart.
[35:12.000 --> 35:16.000]  And, you know, some are black, some are white, some are Hispanic, some are old, some are young,
[35:16.000 --> 35:18.000]  but they all have the spirit of God in them.
[35:18.000 --> 35:21.000]  They all got that fire.
[35:21.000 --> 35:29.000]  And so look forward to Michael Reardon in studio in the third hour today.
[35:29.000 --> 35:32.000]  All right, let me.
[35:32.000 --> 35:40.000]  Again, I've learned that if I come on this show and release the most incredible information, nobody cares.
[35:40.000 --> 35:46.000]  But if you do a drum roll or you build it up, remember in the old days when you know a new movie was out
[35:46.000 --> 35:50.000]  because they'd put big spotlights out at the movie theater and I'd say, Dad, Dad, I want to go see the movies.
[35:50.000 --> 35:51.000]  I want to go see the movies.
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  You go, OK, let's drive over there and see what's showing.
[35:53.000 --> 35:56.000]  The old days you didn't have the internet and smartphones and all that crap.
[35:56.000 --> 35:59.000]  You'd look at the newspaper and you'd be in the car with a newspaper.
[35:59.000 --> 36:05.000]  So we drive over to see what was showing and say, all right, we can stay out late.
[36:05.000 --> 36:06.000]  I'll call mom.
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  Tell her not getting home till midnight.
[36:07.000 --> 36:11.000]  We're going to go see double feature or whatever.
[36:11.000 --> 36:12.000]  And it's the same thing.
[36:12.000 --> 36:15.000]  We need to really make a noise.
[36:15.000 --> 36:18.000]  We really need to get aggressive about this information.
[36:18.000 --> 36:28.000]  That's why yesterday I said on air we need to cut promos about it and get the word out everywhere that we're going to repeat something we did in 2016.
[36:28.000 --> 36:30.000]  They really put me on the New World Order's enemies list.
[36:30.000 --> 36:31.000]  It was so effective.
[36:31.000 --> 36:37.000]  And that was people video bombing, photo bombing, noting that that's not an explosive term.
[36:37.000 --> 36:38.000]  The media will claim that.
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  But the general public knows what it means.
[36:40.000 --> 36:53.000]  Jumping in front of a camera, taking over a live show where it's legal and lawful when they're in a public space, jumping on camera and saying the vaccines are poisoned.
[36:53.000 --> 36:54.000]  This is depopulation.
[36:54.000 --> 36:56.000]  The vaccines will kill you.
[36:56.000 --> 37:01.000]  Infowars.com.
[37:01.000 --> 37:05.000]  And everybody that does it gets $5,000.
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  And I've sold my house.
[37:07.000 --> 37:08.000]  I'm selling.
[37:08.000 --> 37:09.000]  Soon you'll see.
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  I'm going to sell a little bit of art I've got.
[37:11.000 --> 37:12.000]  Everything.
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.000]  Because there's going to be nothing if we don't beat this anyways.
[37:15.000 --> 37:19.000]  I think I might even sell my great-grandmother's China that I was given.
[37:19.000 --> 37:23.000]  Everything's got to go into the fight now.
[37:23.000 --> 37:26.000]  Because they're coming after the children, they're now injecting them with deadly poisons.
[37:26.000 --> 37:40.000]  But my point is, is that there is a planned, designed collapse of civilization taking place right now.
[37:40.000 --> 37:46.000]  And we can't just continue to go on and act like that we're not in the middle of a war.
[37:46.000 --> 37:52.000]  Run by the big corporations and the media, gaslighting us to accept the extermination of the general public.
[37:52.000 --> 37:53.000]  And it's hot and heavy.
[37:53.000 --> 37:54.000]  It's deep now.
[37:54.000 --> 37:58.000]  It's on, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  And so I'm going to cap it at $300,000.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  That's what I did in 2016.
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  We had more money then.
[38:06.000 --> 38:09.000]  We should have known back then how much attack we'd be under.
[38:09.000 --> 38:12.000]  I had a good idea, but I wish I'd have raised more capital, but that's okay.
[38:12.000 --> 38:17.000]  But I'm putting out there $300,000.
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  How many times is $5,000 divided into $300,000?
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  Quite a few times.
[38:22.000 --> 38:30.000]  For every person that confronts the media, that gets out on a live transmission or that goes viral,
[38:30.000 --> 38:35.000]  however it gets out there, $5,000 if it's legally and lawfully done.
[38:35.000 --> 38:40.000]  But it's a form of really low intensity civil disobedience.
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  It's not going in stores and blocking them.
[38:42.000 --> 38:46.000]  It's not going in restaurants and having sit-ins because they want vaccine passports,
[38:46.000 --> 38:49.000]  which I think is a really good thing to do and I commend the folks that are doing it.
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  But you can get arrested, you can get hurt.
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  It's a more serious level.
[38:53.000 --> 38:58.000]  But going in front of local media, college media, national media, sporting events,
[38:58.000 --> 39:01.000]  you get it out audibly and you get it out visually.
[39:01.000 --> 39:05.000]  Believe me, I want to pay the money out.
[39:05.000 --> 39:11.000]  You get it out $5,000 and I'm going to announce this.
[39:11.000 --> 39:18.000]  On February 1st, I will judge out of all the entries who's done the best
[39:18.000 --> 39:21.000]  and they will win $20,000.
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  And we're not just doing this for money.
[39:23.000 --> 39:27.000]  I know you're not doing it for money, but it makes it fun and the award
[39:27.000 --> 39:32.000]  and having the person on because I want to have the folks that are doing it.
[39:32.000 --> 39:38.000]  I mean, remember, Bill and Hillary went Eurorapistinfullwars.com because I wanted to know it was me.
[39:38.000 --> 39:43.000]  I wanted to know some people aren't afraid of them no matter what happens.
[39:43.000 --> 39:46.000]  And then I know who they are and I know they run pedophile rinks.
[39:46.000 --> 39:52.000]  Biden went out to Kentucky to be a ghoul over the population there after the tornadoes
[39:52.000 --> 39:56.000]  and he got called a pedophile.
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.000]  Which, by the way, the FBI now confirms Ashley Biden's diary
[40:00.000 --> 40:06.000]  and we've got Hunter Biden's diary and video, laptop with him
[40:06.000 --> 40:12.000]  and the trophy photos of him and his 13-year-old niece having sex and all the rest of it.
[40:12.000 --> 40:17.000]  I mean, this is a family of pedophiles, ladies and gentlemen.
[40:17.000 --> 40:23.000]  It's mind control. They're all extremely traumatized, very sick.
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.000]  And so that's who they put in, to humiliate us and try to break our will,
[40:28.000 --> 40:32.000]  but he's not our president. We know they stole the election.
[40:32.000 --> 40:38.000]  And so try as they might, humanity's waking up and rejecting them.
[40:38.000 --> 40:44.000]  And now the FBI is trying to put James O'Keeffe in jail when he didn't even put the diary out.
[40:44.000 --> 40:51.000]  I remember it was a controversy at the time that O'Keeffe wouldn't put it out
[40:51.000 --> 40:55.000]  and people said it was real and now it is real.
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  So that attack on the press continues.
[40:57.000 --> 41:01.000]  But do you understand how big the vaccine news is today?
[41:01.000 --> 41:05.000]  The CDC says do not take the J&J shot.
[41:05.000 --> 41:09.000]  First it was a heart warning. Now it's do not take it.
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  Now there's a heart warning on the Pfizer and Moderna.
[41:11.000 --> 41:15.000]  Next it'll be don't take that. How do I know? It's in the SPARS document.
[41:15.000 --> 41:19.000]  But then they'll normalize that they killed you and not get in trouble
[41:19.000 --> 41:22.000]  and roll out more new injections for new viruses.
[41:22.000 --> 41:25.000]  They've cooked up and got it ready for you.
[41:25.000 --> 41:29.000]  This is a civilization destabilization collapse plan.
[41:29.000 --> 41:33.000]  And the only way we get out of it is admitting how much trouble we're in.
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  So we're going to go to break. Long segment coming up.
[41:35.000 --> 41:42.000]  And I'm going to come back and I am going to go over all of this in great detail.
[41:42.000 --> 41:47.000]  CDC warns Americans not to get J&J shot over blood clot risk.
[41:47.000 --> 41:52.000]  School District in New York sends out emails warning parents of sudden cardiac arrest students
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  say get used to it in five-year-olds and up.
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  Now they say as soon as the babies get it,
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  get ready for them to have heart attacks and die as well.
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  Totally normal, totally liberal.
[42:00.000 --> 42:04.000]  Reuters reports refugees lack COVID shots because drug makers fear lawsuits
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  and have not been identified by the UN.
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  Oh, really?
[42:08.000 --> 42:13.000]  X-Pro footballer calls for investigation into footballer suffering heart problems.
[42:13.000 --> 42:18.000]  All Sonora wants to expose health officials who approved COVID vaccine for kids.
[42:18.000 --> 42:21.000]  And now they've got weather reports for the virus.
[42:21.000 --> 42:25.000]  Like I predicted a year and a half ago they would do for the virtual blizzard of Omnicron
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  and all the rest of this BS as they prepare new lockdowns ahead of the election.
[42:29.000 --> 42:33.000]  That's only 10 months away.
[42:33.000 --> 42:41.000]  November, early November 2022 is 300 and 26 days out.
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.000]  365 days in a year.
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  And we don't even have a year.
[42:48.000 --> 42:51.000]  We have 326 days.
[42:51.000 --> 42:56.000]  They're going to hit us with cyber attacks, power outages, terror attacks are going to blame on us and more.
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  Prepare yourselves.
[42:58.000 --> 43:04.000]  So this could be, this could be in full wars last Christmas.
[43:04.000 --> 43:07.000]  Because it could be America's last Christmas.
[43:07.000 --> 43:09.000]  Evil is taking over the planet.
[43:09.000 --> 43:14.000]  They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty, our supply chains, our language, our currencies.
[43:14.000 --> 43:15.000]  They're coming after us.
[43:15.000 --> 43:22.000]  And if we don't support American businesses and if we don't support independent media in the final days of 2021,
[43:22.000 --> 43:25.000]  we have no future in the midterms in 2022.
[43:25.000 --> 43:29.000]  2022 is the year where America decides its fate.
[43:29.000 --> 43:31.000]  I want to thank you all for your support.
[43:31.000 --> 43:34.000]  I want to encourage you to your Christmas shopping at FullWarsTour.com
[43:34.000 --> 43:37.000]  because I can barely keep our operation going.

[43:40.000 --> 43:41.000]  I am so thankful for you.

[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  God fearing systems must fail.
[45:27.000 --> 45:30.000]  So sure, you didn't start a fight with Bill Gates.
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.000]  You didn't start a fight with David Rockefeller.
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  You didn't start a fight with the UN.
[45:35.000 --> 45:38.000]  They started a fight with you.
[45:38.000 --> 45:41.000]  And they're not gonna back down and they're not gonna go away.
[45:41.000 --> 45:44.000]  And they're not going to ever stop their attacks
[45:44.000 --> 45:47.000]  until they have the fear of God put into them.
[45:47.000 --> 45:50.000]  The average person still doesn't even know about the New World Order
[45:50.000 --> 45:53.000]  or about globalism or about corporate fascism.
[45:53.000 --> 45:56.000]  Until people understand that and that we're under attack,
[45:56.000 --> 45:59.000]  we have any chance of beating these people.
[46:01.000 --> 46:03.000]  Get our great bag of it here.
[46:03.000 --> 46:05.000]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[46:05.000 --> 46:08.000]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[46:10.000 --> 46:14.000]  that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[46:14.000 --> 46:16.000]  better than Guatemalan coffee.
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers that, you know,
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  the media calls communists, but really they're just a commune.
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  and we've got it.
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years
[46:29.000 --> 46:30.000]  and the price has never gone up.
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  for about 50% more per pound.
[46:34.000 --> 46:36.000]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[46:36.000 --> 46:37.000]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[46:37.000 --> 46:40.000]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend from the Chiapas Rebels.
[46:40.000 --> 46:41.000]  Literally.
[46:41.000 --> 46:43.000]  In fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story.
[46:46.000 --> 46:47.000]  Yeah, I'd like that.
[46:47.000 --> 46:48.000]  You wouldn't believe it.
[46:48.000 --> 46:51.000]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[46:51.000 --> 46:53.000]  and that's how we fund this operation.
[46:53.000 --> 47:22.000]  And if you don't find us and don't want to share, that's fine.
[47:23.000 --> 47:34.000]  I have no fewer than four clips
[47:34.000 --> 47:38.000]  of politicians and deranged talk show hosts
[47:38.000 --> 47:42.000]  in the United States calling for forced inoculations to begin.
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  Germany and Austria have already announced
[47:44.000 --> 47:47.000]  the forced injection start in February of next year,
[47:47.000 --> 47:50.000]  only a month and a half away.
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  And then we have this headline right here.
[47:52.000 --> 47:53.000]  It's infowarstore.com.
[47:53.000 --> 47:56.000]  Want to make people eat plant-based food?
[47:56.000 --> 47:59.000]  Give them no choice, study finds.
[47:59.000 --> 48:00.000]  That's right.
[48:00.000 --> 48:03.000]  Have the banks and credit cards penalize them
[48:03.000 --> 48:06.000]  in a social credit score if they try to eat meat
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  and then that will phase out meat.
[48:08.000 --> 48:11.000]  Oh, and that's what Biden just said about the banks.
[48:11.000 --> 48:14.000]  He wants the banks to go off a social credit score
[48:14.000 --> 48:20.000]  to decide if you've got a pro-green anti-carbon lifestyle.
[48:20.000 --> 48:25.000]  That's in the news today.
[48:25.000 --> 48:28.000]  Biden saying he wants the banks to control
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  what you can buy and sell and do.
[48:30.000 --> 48:33.000]  No wonder they've announced everybody with $600 or more
[48:33.000 --> 48:36.000]  in transactions a year will have every transaction you do watched.
[48:36.000 --> 48:37.000]  It's already being watched.
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  Now they're normalizing.
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  You're like, well, that violates the Fourth Amendment.
[48:41.000 --> 48:45.000]  Well, a lot of things violate the Fourth Amendment.
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  This is a stampede.
[48:47.000 --> 48:54.000]  It's a criminal revelation, a criminal takeover,
[48:54.000 --> 48:57.000]  a criminal revolution.
[48:57.000 --> 49:04.000]  But here is the puppet Biden last night saying that,
[49:04.000 --> 49:08.000]  oh, it's going to be a horrible winner of death for the unvaccinated.
[49:08.000 --> 49:09.000]  Every statement there is a lie.
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  It's not a vaccine.
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  If you've taken it, it lowers your immunity,
[49:13.000 --> 49:16.000]  whether it's the J&J, the Fives of Moderna, the AstraZeneca.
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  It's not just linked to blood clots.
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  It's proven to do it.
[49:20.000 --> 49:24.000]  And he sits there and lies and says it's a winner of severe illness and death
[49:24.000 --> 49:28.000]  because we've already got double the hospitalizations of COVID this year
[49:28.000 --> 49:29.000]  than we had last year.
[49:29.000 --> 49:32.000]  And they've been double-vaxxed in almost every case.
[49:32.000 --> 49:34.000]  Shame numbers all over the world,
[49:34.000 --> 49:37.000]  from Gibraltar to Singapore to Germany to Israel
[49:37.000 --> 49:43.000]  to the most vaccinated states like Vermont.
[49:43.000 --> 49:46.000]  They have the highest rates of COVID-19.
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  And in places like South Africa with 6% injected,
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  they have the lowest rate in the world.
[49:51.000 --> 49:56.000]  And the news says the ignorant Africans don't trust the government.
[49:56.000 --> 49:59.000]  I wonder why.
[49:59.000 --> 50:02.000]  Don't sound too ignorant to me.
[50:02.000 --> 50:05.000]  They know about the UN and what they're up to.
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  Hell, you can type it in.
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  Even Reuters admits most polio cases,
[50:09.000 --> 50:12.000]  almost all polio cases are caused by the polio vaccine
[50:12.000 --> 50:15.000]  and one in particular, you betcha,
[50:15.000 --> 50:24.000]  build the depopulation master gates.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  Absolutely insane.
[50:26.000 --> 50:29.000]  In India, in Australia, in Africa,
[50:29.000 --> 50:32.000]  people attack the UN workers when they come
[50:32.000 --> 50:38.000]  and try to inject the children at the playgrounds without parental consent.
[50:38.000 --> 50:41.000]  This is footage out of India.
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  They're not stupid.
[50:43.000 --> 50:46.000]  You don't think a white truck with UN workers
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  pulls up to give your kids shots because they like you, right?
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  No. Everybody knows it's to kill you slowly
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  with a soft-kill weapon.
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  And here we are.
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  The J&J shot.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  Oh, but they spin it.
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  Oh, we're saying don't take it and pull it off the market
[51:03.000 --> 51:06.000]  because the others are better and they're effective and safe,
[51:06.000 --> 51:08.000]  which is another lie,
[51:08.000 --> 51:10.000]  which is what Biden has been confronted about,
[51:10.000 --> 51:12.000]  saying, oh, even a month ago,
[51:12.000 --> 51:14.000]  oh, you take it, you're 100% covered.
[51:14.000 --> 51:17.000]  Go ahead and play the clip of him and then Jake Ducey,
[51:17.000 --> 51:20.000]  taking the press secretary to the woodshed.
[51:20.000 --> 51:23.000]  Go ahead and play the clip and then play clip one.
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  We're unvaccinated.
[51:25.000 --> 51:28.000]  We are looking at a winner of severe illness and death.
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  We're unvaccinated.
[51:30.000 --> 51:32.000]  For themselves, their families and the hospital,
[51:32.000 --> 51:34.000]  they'll soon overwhelm.
[51:34.000 --> 51:36.000]  But there's good news.
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  If you're vaccinated, you have your booster shot,
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  you're protected from severe illness and death.
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  Omicron is here.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  It's going to start to spread much more rapidly
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  in the beginning of the year.
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  And the only real protection
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  is to get your shots.
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  If you get one shot,
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  if you haven't gotten it yet, that'll help.
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  If you're at the point where you have everything,
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  including your booster,
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  you're in really good shape.
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  Oh, you're in really good shape
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  with your immune system almost completely turned off.
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  It's Peter Ducey, by the way.
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  Jake Ducey is with the Reset Wars.
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  So, here is Peter Ducey.
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  Really quick.
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  Okay, just quickly.
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  Why is President Biden telling people still
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  that the vaccinated cannot spread COVID?
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  Can you say more?
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  Yeah, in a local interview on Tuesday,
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  he said, how about making sure you're vaccinated
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  so you do not spread the disease to anybody else?
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  The CDC says people who get
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  vaccine breakthrough infections
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  can be contagious.
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  Well, I'll say this.
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  I didn't hear this interview,
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  so I would have to see it in its full context.
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  What I know and what the President believes
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  is that we have to listen to the science.
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  We have to listen to our public health officials,
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  and that's what the President believes.
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  Thank you.
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  You know, Jean Pierre is even more arrogant
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  than Jen Psaki, if it's possible.
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  Because I'd said that Jen Psaki
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  oozed the most arrogance and fraud
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  I'd ever seen out of a woman,
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  except maybe Hillary Clinton.
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  And this woman tops it.
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  The disdain, the arrogance.
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  And she wears it like armor.
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  Oh, well,
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  it doesn't matter if he said
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  the vaccine is 100% effective,
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  even though it's negative effective
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  for six months and destroys your immune system.
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  No, because we have science,
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  and she can kind of move her shoulders around
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  and look all official
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  and kind of stick her chest out.
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  And again, they teach him
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  this arrogant, gas-lighting
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  body language that we see
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  out of the Australian Prime Minister
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  and the New Zealand Prime Minister,
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  and that bozo the clown left us
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  that poses a patriot, Morris Johnson.
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  By the way, I was looking at a photo of him,
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  and we all know this, but
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  pull up Morris Johnson. It's a gimmick.
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  His Einstein hair.
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  If you look, you can see it's all cut
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  in different lengths on the tips,
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  up to a half inch different everywhere
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  to make it look all wild.
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  Oh, look, I'm bozo the clown.
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  I'm trendy. I'm punk rock. I'm cool.
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  You can trust me.
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  He's a murdering, globalist criminal
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  who's married to a Satanist
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  on record,
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  just like Tony Blair.
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  The man is an absolute
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  disgrace and a fraud,
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  and now he's bringing in lockdown twos
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  and, of course, vaccine
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  passports and forced inoculations,
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  but they're not going to call it that.
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  So let's keep running through
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  what these criminals are up to.
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  CDC warns Americans not to get
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  J&J shot over blood clot risk.
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  Isn't that just cute?
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  And then it goes in to say,
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  oh, because the others are safe,
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  which is another lie on record.
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  School District of New York sends
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  out email warning parents
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  of sudden cardiac arrest in five-year-olds
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  and up.
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  We probably obtained a copy of the email
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  where the ESM stated
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  that there are regulation where all districts
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  are now required to ensure that nurses
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  and coaches can address the treatment
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  and monitoring of students who exhibit
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  signs and symptoms of sudden cardiac arrest
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  because, well, you know, it's going to be
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  increasing like the billboards tell us.
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  It's the new normal.
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  And again, I mention this because it's so huge.
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  This is really what people up.
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  Refugees lack COVID shots
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  because drugmakers fear lawsuits
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  document show.
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  Oh, the UN won't sign an agreement
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  indemnifying them.
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  No honor amongst thieves.
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  It's the UN set up by the robber barons
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  so it's their mechanism.
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  So they're not crapping in their own backyard.
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  You don't crap where you eat
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  as they say, but the great patriot
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  way better than President Trump,
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  the real model of global leadership
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  and honor and courage.
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  I'm not putting Trump down, but I mean,
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  he's way below Bolsonaro.
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  Bolsonaro wants to expose
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  health officials who approve COVID vaccine
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  for kids, experimental use,
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  and who tried to get them
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  to sign on to secret agreements
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  with Pfizer. We're going to cover that more
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  next hour and get into the new lockdowns
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  they're going to push, what to expect next year
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  and how to stop it.
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  But I wanted to just show you this document.
[56:03.000 --> 56:05.000]  It's not just sit there and say this is going on
[56:05.000 --> 56:07.000]  and how they admit it. Look at these headlines.
[56:07.000 --> 56:09.000]  ABC.
[56:09.000 --> 56:11.000]  Pfizer has power to silence governments
[56:11.000 --> 56:13.000]  and maximize profits. Consumer group alleges.
[56:13.000 --> 56:15.000]  They don't allege it's in the documents.
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  So I saw that meme
[56:17.000 --> 56:19.000]  out there. It shows a doctor
[56:19.000 --> 56:21.000]  injecting a person's arm, and it says
[56:21.000 --> 56:23.000]  big pharma, 100% liability
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  protection, no liability
[56:25.000 --> 56:27.000]  on his armband. And on the armband
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  of the person getting shot up,
[56:29.000 --> 56:31.000]  it says trust us.
[56:31.000 --> 56:33.000]  In fact, you guys pull that out of the stacker
[56:33.000 --> 56:35.000]  or you print me that from there. I want to
[56:35.000 --> 56:37.000]  I want to show that. But continuing
[56:37.000 --> 56:39.000]  here, ladies and gentlemen,
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  governments signed secret vaccine deals.
[56:41.000 --> 56:43.000]  Here's what they hide. The New York Times
[56:43.000 --> 56:45.000]  even told us
[56:45.000 --> 56:47.000]  in secret vaccine contracts with governments,
[56:47.000 --> 56:49.000]  Pfizer took hard
[56:49.000 --> 56:51.000]  line to push for profit. It's not about profits,
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  it's about murdering people and getting away with it.
[56:53.000 --> 56:55.000]  CDC advised
[56:55.000 --> 56:57.000]  back the use of Pfizer
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  Moderna vaccines over Johnson & Johnson
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  and it just goes on and on.
[57:01.000 --> 57:03.000]  What an incredible
[57:03.000 --> 57:05.000]  time to be
[57:05.000 --> 57:07.000]  alive.
[57:07.000 --> 57:09.000]  And as I said, when we start the next hour
[57:09.000 --> 57:11.000]  on this live Friday edition,
[57:11.000 --> 57:13.000]  I'm going to get into
[57:13.000 --> 57:15.000]  all these other stacks on that front
[57:15.000 --> 57:17.000]  and then the pedophile stack is huge today
[57:17.000 --> 57:19.000]  with all the different CNN people getting busted.
[57:19.000 --> 57:21.000]  Because I mean, look, you can't swing
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  a stick in the dark at CNN and not run into
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  all these people. Or all their
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  shows saying it doesn't exist, it's not
[57:27.000 --> 57:29.000]  happening, but sterilize your child,
[57:29.000 --> 57:31.000]  let the school sterilize them. It's another form
[57:31.000 --> 57:33.000]  of abuse, another form of depopulating,
[57:33.000 --> 57:35.000]  another form of hurting children, which is
[57:35.000 --> 57:37.000]  the religion of these people.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  In olden times, they called them devil
[57:39.000 --> 57:41.000]  worshippers. By the way,
[57:41.000 --> 57:43.000]  Reset Wars is available. It's now live
[57:43.000 --> 57:45.000]  at resetwars.com and the 25%
[57:45.000 --> 57:47.000]  off deal is back running through Christmas.
[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  Everything I
[57:49.000 --> 57:51.000]  do, everything I
[57:51.000 --> 57:53.000]  do is about victory for humanity.
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  Everything I promote
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  is about standing up against the new
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  world order by empowering humanity.
[57:59.000 --> 58:01.000]  Well, that's why ResetWars.com
[58:01.000 --> 58:03.000]  is so important. Not only is it a game-changing
[58:03.000 --> 58:05.000]  course of critical information
[58:05.000 --> 58:07.000]  to unlock your mind from the matrix,
[58:07.000 --> 58:09.000]  but it's something that gets
[58:09.000 --> 58:11.000]  around
[58:11.000 --> 58:13.000]  Klaus Schwab's attempt to shut down
[58:13.000 --> 58:15.000]  American infrastructure
[58:15.000 --> 58:17.000]  and American jobs.
[58:17.000 --> 58:19.000]  It is the true digital economy.
[58:19.000 --> 58:21.000]  It's the spiritual economy
[58:21.000 --> 58:23.000]  of the mind and transcendent
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  control. I've been on there
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  28 years and all of our work
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  has been amazing thanks to God
[58:29.000 --> 58:31.000]  and God's divine
[58:31.000 --> 58:33.000]  empowerment and blessing. But I gotta
[58:33.000 --> 58:35.000]  tell you, out of everything I've done, ResetWars
[58:35.000 --> 58:37.000]  is the most important and it is
[58:37.000 --> 58:39.000]  now available
[58:39.000 --> 58:41.000]  now at the month of December 2021 is here

[58:47.000 --> 58:49.000]  the globalist fear this information.
[58:49.000 --> 58:51.000]  It's time to
[58:51.000 --> 58:53.000]  protect your privacy.
[58:53.000 --> 58:55.000]  It's time to come to grips with the fact
[58:55.000 --> 58:57.000]  that even though you don't have anything to hide
[58:57.000 --> 58:59.000]  criminals, hackers
[58:59.000 --> 59:01.000]  corporations, big tech government
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  are stealing all of your data
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  and creating a map and a database
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  of where you go and what you do.
[59:07.000 --> 59:09.000]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover
[59:09.000 --> 59:11.000]  they can shut you down.
[59:11.000 --> 59:13.000]  Protecting your privacy
[59:13.000 --> 59:15.000]  protecting your credit cards, protecting
[59:15.000 --> 59:17.000]  your bank accounts, protecting your photos
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  protecting everything that's on your phone
[59:19.000 --> 59:21.000]  is paramount. That's why everybody should

[59:45.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  It's amazing.
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:15.000]  Should you wear a mask if you're healthy? No.
[1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:17.000]  And if you're not sick, you shouldn't be wearing a medical mask.
[1:00:17.000 --> 1:00:19.000]  But if you are, then you should. Right now
[1:00:19.000 --> 1:00:21.000]  is our insistence now
[1:00:21.000 --> 1:00:23.000]  on wearing masks.
[1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:25.000]  Do not work for the general public.
[1:00:25.000 --> 1:00:27.000]  People should not be walking around with masks.
[1:00:27.000 --> 1:00:29.000]  There's no reason to be walking around with a mask.
[1:00:29.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  You do not need to wear a medical mask.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:33.000]  Masks don't control viruses. They control you.
[1:00:33.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  That's what's about it.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:37.000]  I really believe that if we get rid of the
[1:00:37.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  masks, the rest of some parts fall down.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:41.000]  It just blew my mind
[1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  how the entire world
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:45.000]  just rolled over and put on a mask.
[1:00:45.000 --> 1:00:47.000]  The biggest issue with face masks
[1:00:47.000 --> 1:00:49.000]  is the impact they have on our children.
[1:00:49.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  But children in masks
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:53.000]  is absolutely dangerous.
[1:00:53.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  And this has to stop.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:00:57.000]  Defend our children.
[1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.000]  The air should not be illegal to breathe.

[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:19.000]  If you study
[1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  what we call evil
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  throughout human history
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000]  it always acts the same.
[1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:27.000]  It is jealous and envious
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  of innocence.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:31.000]  And what is innocence?
[1:01:31.000 --> 1:01:33.000]  It is new life
[1:01:33.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  that has not experienced the universe yet
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  and that has the core programming
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  that God gave it.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:41.000]  They want to torture and kill
[1:01:41.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  people.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  They want to kill people.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  They want to torture and punish that
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  so that they can try to crack their way in
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000]  and create new personalities
[1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  or new software they are able to place
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:01:55.000]  under a hard drive and control us.
[1:01:55.000 --> 1:01:57.000]  People ask
[1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  Jones, why are you so popular?
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  Well, it is the same reason Joe Rogan is so popular.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:03.000]  He is the most alive person
[1:02:03.000 --> 1:02:05.000]  I have ever known. I have known him now
[1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000]  23 years.
[1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  And he is an amazing Renaissance man.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000]  He is not just the top podcaster.
[1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  He is not just an incredible shot with a gun
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000]  but also a great dad.
[1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000]  He is also a really incredible comic.
[1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  He is not just an amazing jujitsu
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:21.000]  or taekwondo champion.
[1:02:21.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  And celebrating Joe's success is a celebration of us all.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:25.000]  So when I see my enemies demonizing me
[1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:27.000]  and lying about me and attacking me
[1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.000]  it is because they are threatened by the fact
[1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  that we have life and we have energy.
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000]  And the reason we do is we are still innocent.
[1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  We are following the innate programming
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:37.000]  that God gave us and we are reaching up into the infinite.
[1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000]  And it is that connection that people are attracted to.
[1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:41.000]  And that is why the globalists are trying to suppress that
[1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:43.000]  and the people is to come together
[1:02:43.000 --> 1:02:45.000]  and to experience life together
[1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000]  and to build incredible art and culture
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  and more life together.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:51.000]  That is what we are as creators.
[1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:53.000]  And that is why there is an attack on the sacred
[1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  coming together of men and women and the sacred family.
[1:02:55.000 --> 1:02:57.000]  Because families are not just nuclear families
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:02:59.000]  they are cultures and societies and peoples
[1:02:59.000 --> 1:03:01.000]  and the globalists are just obliterating all of that.
[1:03:01.000 --> 1:03:03.000]  They are annihilating people's consciousness
[1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:05.000]  and will and connection to the infinite
[1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:07.000]  so they can impose their
[1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:09.000]  enslavement system, their metaverse.
[1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.000]  So instead of using psychological warfare for the TV
[1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.000]  and the culture to create these new false constructs
[1:03:13.000 --> 1:03:15.000]  it is way worse with the metaverse
[1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:17.000]  because now they control all the input
[1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  and are forcing the VR goggles onto children's heads
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:21.000]  and forcing the imposition of this
[1:03:21.000 --> 1:03:23.000]  real life matrix onto them
[1:03:23.000 --> 1:03:25.000]  so that they can crush and destroy
[1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:27.000]  the seed that is in every child
[1:03:27.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  of the potential of the universe as Muhammad Gandhi said.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:31.000]  And that is the information we lay out in recent wars.
[1:03:31.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  And that is the information that spontaneously now
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:35.000]  Elon Musk is talking about
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:37.000]  just days before we release it
[1:03:37.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  and the exact same information
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:41.000]  that is in our film shot months ago
[1:03:41.000 --> 1:03:43.000]  that is in the six hour class
[1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:45.000]  is what Musk is now talking about
[1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  because that is the chain reaction of consciousness
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:49.000]  that happens over and over again throughout history.
[1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.000]  Radio is invented by three people
[1:03:51.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  on two different continents in the same week
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  and it is the same thing with so many other things.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000]  Radio wasn't invented
[1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:59.000]  that technology was already there
[1:03:59.000 --> 1:04:01.000]  humans just discovered it.
[1:04:01.000 --> 1:04:03.000]  So don't let them crush your will
[1:04:03.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  don't let them destroy your destiny
[1:04:05.000 --> 1:04:07.000]  you still have an eight free will
[1:04:07.000 --> 1:04:09.000]  and you can overpower all the propaganda
[1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:11.000]  all the brainwashing, all the garbage
[1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:13.000]  but if you're not conscious of it
[1:04:13.000 --> 1:04:15.000]  don't use your free will to choose freedom
[1:04:15.000 --> 1:04:17.000]  and to choose to be alive
[1:04:17.000 --> 1:04:19.000]  and to choose to be eternally like a child
[1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:21.000]  seeing the world with new eyes every moment
[1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:23.000]  that instead you'll be slaves
[1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:25.000]  of very very evil people that have turned their back
[1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:27.000]  on God and justice and freedom
[1:04:27.000 --> 1:04:29.000]  and who destroyed their futures
[1:04:29.000 --> 1:04:31.000]  and who want to take us with them
[1:04:31.000 --> 1:04:33.000]  into their own metaverse hell they've created
[1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:35.000]  not me
[1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:37.000]  we're launching humanity's counter strike
[1:04:37.000 --> 1:04:39.000]  of love and justice and expansion of consciousness
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:41.000]  at resetwars.com
[1:04:41.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  join me there
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:45.000]  and it's 25% off
[1:04:45.000 --> 1:04:47.000]  ladies and gentlemen we're extending it through
[1:04:47.000 --> 1:04:49.000]  Christmas 25% off
[1:04:49.000 --> 1:04:51.000]  it helps keep him a force on the air
[1:04:51.000 --> 1:04:53.000]  and it really is game changing scientific
[1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.000]  but also spiritual information
[1:04:55.000 --> 1:04:57.000]  the globals don't want you to know
[1:04:57.000 --> 1:04:59.000]  reset wars
[1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.000]  everything I
[1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:03.000]  have the tools to stop this evil
[1:05:03.000 --> 1:05:05.000]  and to break free from it and to help others
[1:05:05.000 --> 1:05:07.000]  break free from it that's why we've launched
[1:05:07.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  reset wars
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:11.000]  once you simply accept that there is
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000]  an incredibly evil group of people in the world
[1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.000]  that are attempting the great reset
[1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:17.000]  and want a one world corporate government
[1:05:17.000 --> 1:05:19.000]  then you can learn how to defeat them
[1:05:19.000 --> 1:05:21.000]  by learning their war game strategies
[1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:23.000]  and how to not play the game
[1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  after decades of intense research
[1:05:27.000 --> 1:05:29.000]  our quest to discover
[1:05:29.000 --> 1:05:31.000]  the way to breaking the globalist bonds
[1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  is now life
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:35.000]  the reset wars have begun
[1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  start your journey
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000]  at resetwars.com today
[1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  their programming are very subconscious
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:43.000]  on our psyche
[1:05:43.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  to create these false constructs that they
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:47.000]  then control
[1:05:47.000 --> 1:05:49.000]  we're going to lay out how that works
[1:05:49.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:53.000]  at resetwars.com
[1:05:53.000 --> 1:05:59.000]  join me there
[1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:25.000]  Friday December 17th
[1:06:25.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  2021
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  and I just spent
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:31.000]  a lot of the first hour hitting the
[1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  biggest news yet
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:35.000]  it just gets topped every month or so
[1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000]  of the last 20 plus months of this COVID
[1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000]  martial law globalist power grab
[1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:43.000]  I'm going to recap the COVID news
[1:06:43.000 --> 1:06:45.000]  in the last segment of this hour
[1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:47.000]  but we've got to cover everything else
[1:06:47.000 --> 1:06:49.000]  that's happening because COVID is the most
[1:06:49.000 --> 1:06:51.000]  important
[1:06:51.000 --> 1:06:53.000]  and it's the preset
[1:06:53.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  system
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  the preset program
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:06:59.000]  to bring in global government
[1:06:59.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  to bring in the castle society
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  to bring in the vaccine passports
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:05.000]  that are the global social credit score
[1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000]  that are the carbon tax system in their own words
[1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.000]  and own plans
[1:07:09.000 --> 1:07:11.000]  they're now operational
[1:07:11.000 --> 1:07:13.000]  so it's the mechanism
[1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  through which they carry out the rest of their agenda
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:17.000]  but it's also important to know
[1:07:17.000 --> 1:07:19.000]  the rest of the agenda
[1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.000]  this was on Twitter this morning
[1:07:21.000 --> 1:07:23.000]  I will send it
[1:07:23.000 --> 1:07:25.000]  I read it at the start of the last hour
[1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:27.000]  I'm going to read it now again
[1:07:27.000 --> 1:07:29.000]  the conspiracy theorists warned
[1:07:29.000 --> 1:07:31.000]  you of
[1:07:31.000 --> 1:07:33.000]  vaccine mandates
[1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:35.000]  vaccine passports
[1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  perpetual lockdowns
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:39.000]  rampant inflation
[1:07:39.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  are you now
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:43.000]  going to start paying attention
[1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000]  are you going to listen to the fact
[1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.000]  that we're now warning you of
[1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  a digital ID
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:51.000]  social credit score
[1:07:51.000 --> 1:07:53.000]  central bank digital currencies
[1:07:53.000 --> 1:07:55.000]  climate lockdowns
[1:07:55.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  energy rationing
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:07:59.000]  are you paying attention
[1:07:59.000 --> 1:08:01.000]  when you see and hear
[1:08:01.000 --> 1:08:03.000]  all the horrible, evil
[1:08:03.000 --> 1:08:05.000]  depopulation
[1:08:05.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  forced abortion
[1:08:09.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  statements
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:13.000]  out of the extinction rebellion group
[1:08:13.000 --> 1:08:15.000]  you're hearing what
[1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000]  Ted Turner and Bill Gates
[1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:19.000]  and Klaus Schwab
[1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  and Ted Turner
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  want to do to you
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  and George Soros, he's involved
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:27.000]  Warren Buffett's involved
[1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000]  Charlie Munger's involved
[1:08:29.000 --> 1:08:31.000]  that's why you see Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett going
[1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:33.000]  yeah we got to depopulate people at least 80%
[1:08:33.000 --> 1:08:35.000]  yeah I like China how their dictators
[1:08:35.000 --> 1:08:37.000]  we need that here
[1:08:37.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  I can play the clips
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000]  that's who they are
[1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  and so many people have said
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  well I'll just go along with them
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000]  because they'll pay me as a corporate minion
[1:08:47.000 --> 1:08:49.000]  if I just follow orders
[1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.000]  but they're doing it with money
[1:08:51.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  that is being rapidly devalued
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000]  that's why real estate is exploding
[1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:57.000]  the real estate hasn't actually
[1:08:57.000 --> 1:08:59.000]  gone up in real value
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:01.000]  I know everybody knows this
[1:09:01.000 --> 1:09:03.000]  but I know people that convinced themselves
[1:09:03.000 --> 1:09:05.000]  man, five years ago I had
[1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.000]  $300,000 in the bank
[1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  I just sold my house for $3 million
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  I'm a millionaire
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:13.000]  you're not, yeah
[1:09:13.000 --> 1:09:15.000]  $3 million
[1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:17.000]  50 years ago
[1:09:17.000 --> 1:09:19.000]  would buy 20 times what it does now
[1:09:19.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  conservatively
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:23.000]  so
[1:09:23.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  none of it means anything
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  except the globalists get first use of it
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:29.000]  to buy up companies, buy up corporations
[1:09:29.000 --> 1:09:31.000]  buy up patents and pay people
[1:09:31.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  for social
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.000]  engineering purposes
[1:09:35.000 --> 1:09:37.000]  to follow their orders
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  and they're flooding the world with
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:41.000]  billions a day
[1:09:41.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  a day
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:45.000]  in currencies
[1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:47.000]  for compliance
[1:09:47.000 --> 1:09:49.000]  and they're getting all these people to do
[1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  incredibly insane things
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  I was reading where
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  a Democrat senator
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:57.000]  vetoed a bill against Chinese death camps
[1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  because he got $60,000 from Nike
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:01.000]  he could come to me with $50,000,000
[1:10:01.000 --> 1:10:03.000]  and say
[1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000]  we want you to support Chinese death camps
[1:10:05.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  and we'll give you this money
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  and my soul's not worth that
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  are you kidding me?
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:13.000]  but see, these globalists just laugh
[1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  and say I'm gonna be God, screw God
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:17.000]  I'm gonna do what I want
[1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.000]  I'm survival of the fittest
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  that's what we have is people
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:27.000]  engaged in predator activities
[1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000]  against their own species
[1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  and I understand
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  that those of you out there that aren't evil people
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:35.000]  don't get that
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:37.000]  because it seems so alien
[1:10:37.000 --> 1:10:39.000]  but if you study history you see
[1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  that tyranny and oppression
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  and predatory activity is the norm
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  not the exception
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:47.000]  and that freedom
[1:10:47.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  and justice and the renaissance
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:51.000]  and Christianity is extremely rare
[1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:53.000]  and when it's actually practiced
[1:10:53.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  incredible wealth and power ensues
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:57.000]  but then we always fall back
[1:10:57.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  into our pagan ways don't we
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  we always fall away yet again
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:03.000]  and again and again
[1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  but by the glory of God
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:09.000]  I have been extracted from it
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000]  and I am so thankful
[1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.000]  oh my God, thank you Lord
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:19.000]  so
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:21.000]  let me hit the rest of the news right now
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.000]  let's talk about pedophile news
[1:11:25.000 --> 1:11:31.000]  again I want to explain this
[1:11:33.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  you have a son, you have a daughter
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  or you have a nephew, you have a niece
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:39.000]  you want to go have fun with them
[1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:41.000]  you want to draw and paint with them
[1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:43.000]  you want to swim with them, you want to hike with them
[1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  you want to play with toys with them
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:47.000]  you want to squeeze on them and hug them
[1:11:47.000 --> 1:11:49.000]  and cook them food and just
[1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.000]  just take care of them because your instinct
[1:11:51.000 --> 1:11:53.000]  is normal and good
[1:11:53.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  and the symbolists
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:57.000]  the psychic vampires see a child
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:11:59.000]  and all they see is that energy
[1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:01.000]  and that power and that potential for the future
[1:12:03.000 --> 1:12:05.000]  and they look at them like wheatgrass
[1:12:05.000 --> 1:12:07.000]  because you know
[1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:09.000]  we sell a product that's concentrated wheatgrass
[1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000]  people love, it's the green capsules
[1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000]  because wheatgrass is the budding
[1:12:13.000 --> 1:12:15.000]  wheat
[1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  and it's got
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:19.000]  20, 30, 40, 50 times
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:21.000]  depending on the type you're growing
[1:12:21.000 --> 1:12:23.000]  the actual vitamins and nutrients
[1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:25.000]  and things you're going to get from adult wheat
[1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000]  because it's all the energy
[1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:29.000]  of that seed
[1:12:29.000 --> 1:12:31.000]  reaching up towards the sky
[1:12:31.000 --> 1:12:33.000]  and up towards the light
[1:12:33.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  well it's okay to eat baby
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:37.000]  baby
[1:12:37.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  wheat
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:41.000]  or baby alfalfa or whatever
[1:12:41.000 --> 1:12:43.000]  sprouting seed you're getting
[1:12:43.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  but you certainly
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:47.000]  don't want it to be children
[1:12:47.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  and if you look at children
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:51.000]  and want to hurt them
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:53.000]  and want to abuse them
[1:12:53.000 --> 1:12:55.000]  and want to take their innocence away
[1:12:55.000 --> 1:12:57.000]  you are working for the other side
[1:12:57.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  see
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:01.000]  I don't want to hurt children
[1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:03.000]  I want to hurt people that want to hurt children
[1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:05.000]  I want to kill you
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:07.000]  and that's not because
[1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:09.000]  I like to kill people
[1:13:09.000 --> 1:13:11.000]  I like to protect children
[1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  I guarantee you
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:17.000]  these people are going to
[1:13:17.000 --> 1:13:19.000]  go help
[1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:21.000]  because the universe is big
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  and it's real
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:25.000]  and what your energy frequency is
[1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000]  that's all you are is a creature of light
[1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  an energy field will go to what you chose
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:33.000]  so they're coming after our children
[1:13:33.000 --> 1:13:35.000]  like they're a little seed they want to eat
[1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  because it's that potential
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  that they don't have
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:41.000]  they've sold it out, they've given it up
[1:13:41.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  for whatever reason and so now
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  all the zombies do is seek
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:47.000]  their innocence
[1:13:47.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  and so you see
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  the zombie in chief
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:53.000]  the archetype of a toddling servant of evil
[1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:55.000]  dead, soulless
[1:13:55.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  runs a family controlled by pedophilia
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:59.000]  and child rape
[1:13:59.000 --> 1:14:01.000]  toddling out to go
[1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.000]  to the tornado victims
[1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:05.000]  so he can perch there like the grim reaper
[1:14:05.000 --> 1:14:07.000]  and extract power like he's the savior
[1:14:07.000 --> 1:14:09.000]  and literally crowds are like
[1:14:09.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  get out of here we hate you get out of here
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  you're a pedophile
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000]  there's like 5-6 clips you gotta go watch
[1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  so humanity is rejecting him
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000]  and that's good news no matter where he goes
[1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:23.000]  Hispanic neighborhoods black white doesn't matter
[1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  but now what do we have on the whole pedophile front
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:31.000]  well there's not just raping children
[1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  there's this forced labor as young as 10
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  in China democrat senator
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  who blocked China forced labor bill
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:39.000]  received 60,000 K
[1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  from Nike execs in September
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000]  and my point of showing this article is
[1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:45.000]  there's things far worse than just some
[1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  pot belly pedophile raping a little boy or girl
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:49.000]  which is horrible and destroys their innocence
[1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  and is so evil many times gives them diseases
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:53.000]  it's horrible
[1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:55.000]  but on a scale of 1 to 10 it's about a 3
[1:14:57.000 --> 1:14:59.000]  injecting a child with something that's going to attack
[1:14:59.000 --> 1:15:01.000]  their immune system and shut it down for years and years
[1:15:01.000 --> 1:15:03.000]  probably forever we don't know yet
[1:15:03.000 --> 1:15:05.000]  and give them blood clots
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.000]  and could kill them
[1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:09.000]  I mean I'm not calling for raping children
[1:15:09.000 --> 1:15:11.000]  I was one of those kids and it could roll the dice
[1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:13.000]  I said okay I'd rather the pedophile rape me
[1:15:13.000 --> 1:15:15.000]  than be raped by Pfizer
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:17.000]  and Bill Gates' shot that takes over my DNA
[1:15:17.000 --> 1:15:19.000]  you know you can go wash up and get cleaned up
[1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000]  after you're raping you know toughen up a bit
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:23.000]  but they don't want that they want the real rape
[1:15:23.000 --> 1:15:25.000]  the genetic rape and then there's working
[1:15:25.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  in forced labor camps till you die rape
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  this senator for 60,000 bucks he supports that
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:31.000]  10 year olds being worked to death
[1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000]  and I'm talking 18 hours a day
[1:15:35.000 --> 1:15:37.000]  so we're talking about other forms of rape
[1:15:37.000 --> 1:15:39.000]  when we come back and understand
[1:15:39.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  these people like the power
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  like you've got the energy field to want to help children
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000]  and even the thought of hurting them totally freaks you out
[1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  the thought of hurting children to them
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:49.000]  is like you want to eat a big old piece
[1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000]  of pecan pie with ice cream
[1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:53.000]  it just sounds so delicious and wonderful
[1:15:53.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  and everything they do is about getting access to your children

[1:19:59.840 --> 1:20:04.440]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[1:20:04.440 --> 1:20:05.640]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:05.640 --> 1:20:19.200]  MUSIC
[1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:22.120]  Well, I talked to Roger a couple days ago,
[1:20:22.120 --> 1:20:23.480]  and he said he's pleading the 5th.
[1:20:23.480 --> 1:20:26.040]  He was going to be in DC today.
[1:20:26.040 --> 1:20:28.480]  I was summoning there as well today.
[1:20:28.480 --> 1:20:30.400]  You notice I'm not there.
[1:20:30.400 --> 1:20:36.120]  And he'll be joining us tomorrow exclusively
[1:20:36.120 --> 1:20:39.320]  to do a commercial-free hour-long interview at noon
[1:20:39.320 --> 1:20:41.320]  that will air at 4 o'clock tomorrow.
[1:20:41.320 --> 1:20:43.600]  I'm doing a whole bunch of interviews today and tomorrow
[1:20:43.600 --> 1:20:45.680]  that are going to air as a Saturday emergency broadcast,
[1:20:45.680 --> 1:20:48.480]  and Roger will be on.
[1:20:48.480 --> 1:20:51.200]  It'll obviously be extremely newsmaking if I tell people
[1:20:51.200 --> 1:20:55.840]  what I'm up to and what my legal strategy is.
[1:20:55.840 --> 1:21:00.720]  But I have decided to really not try to be involved
[1:21:00.720 --> 1:21:03.160]  in the spotlight with this whole January 6 thing,
[1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:06.680]  because anything I say is going to be twisted around by Schiff
[1:21:06.680 --> 1:21:07.400]  and the rest of it.
[1:21:07.400 --> 1:21:14.280]  So I'm thinking about making a statement tomorrow
[1:21:14.280 --> 1:21:16.280]  during the show, and we'll see.
[1:21:16.280 --> 1:21:20.840]  But I'll just be honest with you.
[1:21:20.840 --> 1:21:23.280]  With them coming after children with these deadly shots
[1:21:23.280 --> 1:21:25.240]  and confirmed it's giving them blood clots
[1:21:25.240 --> 1:21:27.480]  and a race in their immune system,
[1:21:27.480 --> 1:21:30.480]  I just fundamentally, like at a Holy Spirit level,
[1:21:30.480 --> 1:21:32.160]  I don't know how to explain this,
[1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:33.800]  I don't have like a Machiavelli strategy.
[1:21:33.800 --> 1:21:35.920]  It's just God says, hey, I don't want you
[1:21:35.920 --> 1:21:37.080]  to defend yourself right now.
[1:21:37.080 --> 1:21:39.440]  I want you to just fight the forced injections
[1:21:39.440 --> 1:21:41.040]  and expose the inflation.
[1:21:41.040 --> 1:21:43.400]  The people aren't tuning in to hear about you.
[1:21:43.400 --> 1:21:45.680]  They're not tuning in to hear about the globalist.
[1:21:45.680 --> 1:21:48.240]  And the way Trump got distracted by Russiagate
[1:21:48.240 --> 1:21:50.160]  for four years instead of his agenda
[1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:52.240]  is why they were able to steal the election from him
[1:21:52.240 --> 1:21:55.800]  and everything else to happen.
[1:21:55.800 --> 1:21:57.160]  And so there's a lot goes into that.
[1:21:57.160 --> 1:21:59.760]  And I'm not knocking Roger going and having a press conference.
[1:21:59.760 --> 1:22:00.560]  I think it's great.
[1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:02.040]  And standing up, and he did a great job,
[1:22:02.040 --> 1:22:03.080]  and he'll be on tomorrow.
[1:22:03.080 --> 1:22:05.240]  We'll talk some about it tomorrow.
[1:22:05.240 --> 1:22:12.280]  I just cannot be distracted by what's going on to myself
[1:22:12.280 --> 1:22:14.040]  and even others, because we're grown men,
[1:22:14.040 --> 1:22:16.040]  when the children are under attack at this level.
[1:22:16.040 --> 1:22:18.480]  And I don't say that at some heroic point.
[1:22:18.480 --> 1:22:25.520]  I just need to keep the focus on the children.
[1:22:25.520 --> 1:22:27.880]  That's what I'm supposed to do.
[1:22:27.880 --> 1:22:30.040]  And even me explaining this right now
[1:22:30.040 --> 1:22:32.200]  is a form of not keeping it focused on the children.
[1:22:32.200 --> 1:22:34.200]  But I think you get what I'm saying.
[1:22:34.200 --> 1:22:38.600]  We've had so many phone calls, so many emails and text
[1:22:38.600 --> 1:22:40.160]  messages the last day.
[1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:42.760]  Why aren't you covering JFK?
[1:22:42.760 --> 1:22:44.040]  Why aren't you covering the government
[1:22:44.040 --> 1:22:47.160]  with some more documents on that?
[1:22:47.160 --> 1:22:49.320]  That'd be like the government releasing documents
[1:22:49.320 --> 1:22:55.160]  on George Washington having dental problems.
[1:22:55.160 --> 1:22:57.720]  I mean, we know who killed Kennedy.
[1:22:57.720 --> 1:23:01.120]  I had the exclusive, along with George Norring,
[1:23:01.120 --> 1:23:04.000]  of E. Howard Hunt and his son, and all the proof.
[1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:07.760]  Plus, I knew other people we interviewed who were involved.
[1:23:07.760 --> 1:23:10.160]  I mean, we know the CIA killed Kennedy.
[1:23:10.160 --> 1:23:11.920]  We know what went on.
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:13.880]  There's no point.
[1:23:13.880 --> 1:23:15.200]  I mean, do you need me to tell you
[1:23:15.200 --> 1:23:16.840]  the January 6th Committees of Fraud?
[1:23:16.840 --> 1:23:18.720]  Do you need me to tell you they're trying to put me in jail?
[1:23:18.720 --> 1:23:21.120]  Do you need me to tell you, no, no, you know, you know that.
[1:23:24.560 --> 1:23:26.240]  But at the same time, I'm definitely
[1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:28.400]  interested in all of it.
[1:23:28.400 --> 1:23:31.600]  And I was sitting there reading JFK documents 1,500 pages.
[1:23:31.600 --> 1:23:33.280]  I was scanning over in this morning.
[1:23:33.280 --> 1:23:35.280]  And I'm sitting there like 5 AM reading these things.
[1:23:35.280 --> 1:23:36.960]  And I'm like, why am I reading this?
[1:23:36.960 --> 1:23:39.000]  I already know all this.
[1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:40.840]  And they only released what they wanted to release.
[1:23:40.840 --> 1:23:45.240]  This is a rat trail, worse than a rabbit trail.
[1:23:45.240 --> 1:23:46.840]  It doesn't matter.
[1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:54.320]  Now, defending myself from the January 6th witch hunt
[1:23:54.320 --> 1:23:57.000]  is important, but we do that by financially
[1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:59.160]  funding the operation.
[1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:00.960]  And I think about how much we're under attack.
[1:24:00.960 --> 1:24:02.960]  I think about how effective we are.
[1:24:02.960 --> 1:24:05.920]  All glory goes to God and to you guys that have spread the word.
[1:24:05.920 --> 1:24:09.080]  But I mean, I've had almost all the big names.
[1:24:09.080 --> 1:24:15.680]  Bolsonaro, the list goes on, say, this show woke them up.
[1:24:15.680 --> 1:24:18.720]  The guests, the callers, myself, this.
[1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:22.840]  This is the most effective flagship in the fight.
[1:24:22.840 --> 1:24:24.760]  And we are battle-hardened.
[1:24:24.760 --> 1:24:25.960]  We are scarred.
[1:24:25.960 --> 1:24:27.640]  We are wounded.
[1:24:27.640 --> 1:24:30.600]  We are punished.
[1:24:30.600 --> 1:24:36.360]  But this crew, these hosts, Owen and Christie Lee
[1:24:36.360 --> 1:24:39.600]  and the great Harrison Smith and Wilson,
[1:24:39.600 --> 1:24:42.240]  and all the people here that do the job,
[1:24:42.240 --> 1:24:46.400]  they're all superstars in the fight for liberty.
[1:24:46.400 --> 1:24:48.640]  And so I'm just glad you keep us on air.
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:54.360]  And I can just tell you, we're going to continue to fight hard,
[1:24:54.360 --> 1:24:57.680]  but we're going to do our best not to make the whole thing
[1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:00.360]  about us, other than to explain, we're
[1:25:00.360 --> 1:25:02.880]  the tip of the spear, so we must have your support.
[1:25:02.880 --> 1:25:06.240]  I mean, who could not support Info Wars at this point?
[1:25:06.240 --> 1:25:08.280]  I mean, I'm just blown away that we're in this position,
[1:25:08.280 --> 1:25:10.760]  and I'm so incredibly thankful.
[1:25:10.760 --> 1:25:14.160]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, go to infowarstore.com.
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:16.200]  In the lower 48, you'll get your presence
[1:25:16.200 --> 1:25:19.760]  that you ordered from us way before Christmas.
[1:25:19.760 --> 1:25:22.200]  The Postal Service told people to say that Thursday was
[1:25:22.200 --> 1:25:24.840]  the last day to have it within a few days before Christmas,
[1:25:24.840 --> 1:25:27.320]  but now they say, oh, actually, packages are caught up,
[1:25:27.320 --> 1:25:31.160]  so you can tell people, get their orders in by Saturday.
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:34.840]  But I'm going to say today is the last day
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:37.200]  to get an Alex Jones, did nothing wrong,
[1:25:37.200 --> 1:25:42.040]  T-shirt, or a Molon Labe shirt, or a Prostagard,
[1:25:42.040 --> 1:25:47.520]  or DNA Force Plus, or Rain Force Plus, or Turbo Force,
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:51.280]  or vitamin mineral fusion, up to 60% off,
[1:25:51.280 --> 1:25:53.720]  store-wide free shipping, double-patriot points.
[1:25:53.720 --> 1:25:56.080]  And always the best deals of the year
[1:25:56.080 --> 1:26:00.880]  are from November into December.
[1:26:00.880 --> 1:26:02.720]  And so these are the best deals of the year,
[1:26:02.720 --> 1:26:04.800]  and it keeps us on the air, and I want to thank you all.
[1:26:04.800 --> 1:26:06.560]  Ultimate Creole Oil is the highest-grade
[1:26:06.560 --> 1:26:07.920]  of Creole Oil out there.
[1:26:07.920 --> 1:26:09.280]  You want to experience some dreams.
[1:26:09.280 --> 1:26:12.120]  You want to experience something psychoactive in my view.
[1:26:12.120 --> 1:26:15.800]  This stuff is rocket fuel.
[1:26:15.800 --> 1:26:17.720]  When I don't take it, I really notice.
[1:26:17.720 --> 1:26:18.600]  It's amazing.
[1:26:18.600 --> 1:26:20.160]  It's back in stock discounted.
[1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:24.520]  Infowarsstore.com, or AAA-253-3139.
[1:26:24.520 --> 1:26:26.560]  We also have Cub and Land 2, The Mask,
[1:26:26.560 --> 1:26:27.960]  which is an activist film.
[1:26:27.960 --> 1:26:30.560]  You're authorized, and I ask you to get it and make copies.
[1:26:30.560 --> 1:26:32.840]  You get two films free with it.
[1:26:32.840 --> 1:26:35.440]  When you get it, Order of Death and Dark Secrets
[1:26:35.440 --> 1:26:40.640]  inside Bohemian Grove, that's at infowarsstore.com as well.
[1:26:40.640 --> 1:26:43.200]  And there will be one thing everybody can still get
[1:26:43.200 --> 1:26:45.640]  after today before Christmas, right up until Christmas
[1:26:45.640 --> 1:26:48.640]  morning, because you get your notification within about three
[1:26:48.640 --> 1:26:49.960]  minutes on average.
[1:26:49.960 --> 1:26:54.120]  Some people, it takes five minutes, and that's Reset Wars.
[1:26:54.120 --> 1:26:56.120]  Resetwars.com.
[1:26:56.120 --> 1:26:57.400]  You want to break the conditioning.
[1:26:57.400 --> 1:26:59.800]  You want to focus on how they're brainwashing you
[1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:03.920]  to become aware of it, and to be able to consciously
[1:27:03.920 --> 1:27:06.520]  understand how they're doing it so you can consciously,
[1:27:06.520 --> 1:27:09.320]  with your will, push out their brainwashing,
[1:27:09.320 --> 1:27:11.440]  push out how they tried to make you insecure,
[1:27:11.440 --> 1:27:14.240]  push you out of your destiny, and your alignment with God
[1:27:14.240 --> 1:27:17.760]  to get you back aligned with God, not through what I tell you,
[1:27:17.760 --> 1:27:20.280]  not through what I say, but through you understanding
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:22.800]  the innate power that God put into you
[1:27:22.800 --> 1:27:26.480]  and God formed your soul before you were in your mother's womb.
[1:27:26.480 --> 1:27:29.120]  I knew you before you were in your mother's womb.
[1:27:29.120 --> 1:27:31.440]  Before you were in your mother's womb.
[1:27:31.440 --> 1:27:35.800]  This is the sum total of the real secret weapon systems
[1:27:35.800 --> 1:27:38.640]  of history and the CIA mind control.
[1:27:38.640 --> 1:27:42.200]  Just all of it goes in to a cosmology that is my own,
[1:27:42.200 --> 1:27:43.960]  but borrows from a lot of great thinkers,
[1:27:43.960 --> 1:27:46.840]  from Carl Jung to you name it.
[1:27:46.840 --> 1:27:48.280]  So it's there.
[1:27:48.280 --> 1:27:51.440]  It keeps us on air, which is another great event.
[1:27:51.440 --> 1:27:53.040]  And I thank you for your support,
[1:27:53.040 --> 1:27:58.120]  and I thank you for your tireless defense of this broadcast.
[1:27:58.120 --> 1:27:59.400]  You're just amazing.
[1:27:59.400 --> 1:28:00.520]  And I just want to stay on this fight,
[1:28:00.520 --> 1:28:03.520]  so thank you so much for the fraction of an NFL ticket
[1:28:03.520 --> 1:28:06.800]  or a George Straight ticket, or whatever.
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:08.040]  I mean, those things are $1,000.
[1:28:08.040 --> 1:28:13.040]  This is $200 right now, $225 or $24 discounted,
[1:28:13.680 --> 1:28:17.360]  and it's 25% off right now at resetwars.com.
[1:28:17.360 --> 1:28:19.960]  And a lot of these online courses like this
[1:28:19.960 --> 1:28:23.000]  are $1,000 or more, because people don't appreciate it.
[1:28:23.000 --> 1:28:25.560]  It's not that, plus there's huge production that goes in,
[1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:27.160]  just like you'd have with a rock man or whatever.
[1:28:27.160 --> 1:28:28.880]  There's a lot of expenses behind it
[1:28:28.880 --> 1:28:30.080]  and the infrastructure.
[1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:33.480]  But with this course, we're launching it
[1:28:33.480 --> 1:28:35.600]  to then launch a bunch of other stuff with it
[1:28:35.600 --> 1:28:39.680]  and a whole platform that is basically at cost in the future.
[1:28:39.680 --> 1:28:41.360]  And we're gonna have stuff where whole presentations
[1:28:41.360 --> 1:28:42.760]  are like $9.95.
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:44.720]  But we've got to build the infrastructure,
[1:28:44.720 --> 1:28:46.080]  so it's like you're giving an endowment
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:48.840]  to Founding University, basically, is what you're doing.
[1:28:48.840 --> 1:28:52.320]  So I would join today at resetwars.com.
[1:28:52.320 --> 1:28:55.140]  25% off deal is back until Christmas.
[1:28:55.140 --> 1:28:58.700]  So many people say to me, Alex, please.
[1:28:58.700 --> 1:29:01.260]  We have developed the research and the tools
[1:29:01.260 --> 1:29:03.620]  to stop this evil and to break free from it
[1:29:03.620 --> 1:29:05.340]  and then to help others break free from it.
[1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:07.940]  That's why we've launched resetwars.
[1:29:07.940 --> 1:29:09.780]  Once you simply accept that there is
[1:29:09.780 --> 1:29:11.980]  an incredibly evil group of people in the world
[1:29:11.980 --> 1:29:13.580]  that are attempting the great reset
[1:29:13.580 --> 1:29:16.340]  and want a one-world corporate government,
[1:29:16.340 --> 1:29:18.340]  then you can learn how to defeat them
[1:29:18.340 --> 1:29:20.820]  by learning their war game strategies
[1:29:20.820 --> 1:29:23.380]  and how to not play the game.
[1:29:23.380 --> 1:29:25.820]  After decades of intense research,
[1:29:26.700 --> 1:29:28.700]  our quest to discover the key
[1:29:28.700 --> 1:29:32.380]  to breaking the globalist bonds is now life.
[1:29:32.380 --> 1:29:35.220]  The reset wars have begun.
[1:29:35.220 --> 1:29:39.220]  Start your journey at resetwars.com today.
[1:29:39.220 --> 1:29:42.020]  Your programming are very subconscious in our psyche
[1:29:42.020 --> 1:29:45.940]  to create these false constructs that they then control.
[1:29:45.940 --> 1:29:47.620]  We're gonna lay out how that works.
[1:29:47.620 --> 1:29:50.500]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins
[1:29:50.500 --> 1:29:52.220]  at resetwars.com.
[1:29:52.220 --> 1:29:53.620]  Please join me there.
[1:29:58.620 --> 1:30:03.340]  This could be in full wars last Christmas.
[1:30:03.340 --> 1:30:06.020]  Because it could be America's last Christmas.
[1:30:06.020 --> 1:30:08.140]  Evil is taking over the planet.
[1:30:08.140 --> 1:30:10.020]  They're destroying our borders, our sovereignty,
[1:30:10.020 --> 1:30:12.780]  our supply chains, our language, our currencies.
[1:30:12.780 --> 1:30:14.100]  They're coming after us.
[1:30:14.100 --> 1:30:16.780]  And if we don't support American businesses
[1:30:16.780 --> 1:30:18.740]  and if we don't support independent media
[1:30:18.740 --> 1:30:20.580]  in the final days of 2021,
[1:30:20.580 --> 1:30:23.540]  we have no future in the midterms in 2022.
[1:30:23.540 --> 1:30:28.220]  2022 is the year where America decides its fate.
[1:30:28.220 --> 1:30:30.060]  I wanna thank you all for your support.
[1:30:30.060 --> 1:30:32.060]  I wanna encourage you to your Christmas shopping
[1:30:32.060 --> 1:30:33.300]  then fullwars.com
[1:30:33.300 --> 1:30:35.700]  because I can barely keep our operation going.
[1:30:35.700 --> 1:30:38.260]  And I appreciate you keeping us in the position
[1:30:38.260 --> 1:30:39.100]  to fight back.
[1:30:39.100 --> 1:30:40.300]  I am so thankful for you.
[1:30:40.300 --> 1:30:42.660]  And I'm asking you now to realize the huge investment
[1:30:42.660 --> 1:30:43.940]  you made over the years in us.
[1:30:43.940 --> 1:30:46.740]  And I'll redouble your efforts to make sure
[1:30:46.740 --> 1:30:48.580]  that your investment in freedom continues on.
[1:30:48.580 --> 1:30:52.940]  infowarstore.com has incredible products,
[1:30:52.940 --> 1:30:55.740]  store-wide free shipping up until December 20th.
[1:30:55.740 --> 1:30:57.980]  So please take action now and keep us on the air.
[1:30:57.980 --> 1:30:58.820]  Thank you.
[1:30:58.820 --> 1:31:00.140]  I've been fighting as hard as I can
[1:31:00.140 --> 1:31:03.220]  for almost 28 years against the globalists.
[1:31:03.220 --> 1:31:05.300]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[1:31:05.300 --> 1:31:06.940]  I wanted to wake up the world
[1:31:06.940 --> 1:31:09.140]  and stop them dead in their tracks
[1:31:09.140 --> 1:31:10.860]  before they went operational.
[1:31:10.860 --> 1:31:11.940]  But we failed.
[1:31:11.940 --> 1:31:13.580]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[1:31:13.580 --> 1:31:15.460]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[1:31:15.460 --> 1:31:19.220]  but they are going ahead with their full operational
[1:31:19.220 --> 1:31:21.460]  deindustrialization great reset.
[1:31:21.460 --> 1:31:23.420]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[1:31:23.420 --> 1:31:25.940]  that all viewers and all listeners tell everybody
[1:31:25.940 --> 1:31:27.460]  they know about the show
[1:31:27.460 --> 1:31:28.940]  because people are ready to wake up
[1:31:28.940 --> 1:31:30.380]  and ready to hear the truth.
[1:31:30.380 --> 1:31:32.300]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[1:31:32.300 --> 1:31:33.700]  and trying to stop their agenda.
[1:31:33.700 --> 1:31:35.940]  We've also got to get personally prepared.
[1:31:35.940 --> 1:31:37.060]  And one of the number one things to do
[1:31:37.060 --> 1:31:38.540]  is high quality, storeable food.
[1:31:38.540 --> 1:31:39.460]  We've got the best food,
[1:31:39.460 --> 1:31:41.740]  ready to ship at very affordable prices
[1:31:41.740 --> 1:31:43.220]  at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:43.220 --> 1:31:44.980]  So whether it's a month or a six month
[1:31:44.980 --> 1:31:47.100]  or a year supply or specialty diets,
[1:31:47.100 --> 1:31:48.860]  it's ready to ship right now.
[1:31:48.860 --> 1:31:51.660]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[1:31:51.660 --> 1:31:53.780]  and before there are long lines and waits
[1:31:53.780 --> 1:31:56.100]  because believe me, serious times are coming.
[1:31:56.100 --> 1:31:58.460]  Get ready at infowarstore.com.
[1:31:58.460 --> 1:32:01.100]  The average person on the face of this incredible planet
[1:32:01.100 --> 1:32:03.300]  is still unaware that there's a war
[1:32:03.300 --> 1:32:07.260]  between free individuals and nation states on one side
[1:32:07.260 --> 1:32:08.860]  and the globalist on the other
[1:32:08.860 --> 1:32:12.380]  who are literally trying to create a post human world.
[1:32:12.380 --> 1:32:13.900]  For the United States of Brazil,
[1:32:13.900 --> 1:32:16.260]  of course, triggered by the Brexit in the UK,
[1:32:16.260 --> 1:32:17.420]  nations were pulling out
[1:32:17.420 --> 1:32:20.140]  of the private corporate fascist world government.
[1:32:20.140 --> 1:32:22.660]  That's why they launched their great reset
[1:32:22.660 --> 1:32:26.420]  and their program after collapsing us of Build Back Better.
[1:32:27.380 --> 1:32:31.660]  This is nothing more than a top down vertical consolidation
[1:32:31.660 --> 1:32:33.260]  of the world economy.
[1:32:33.260 --> 1:32:34.740]  Because they couldn't take our guns
[1:32:34.740 --> 1:32:36.060]  and because we wouldn't bow
[1:32:36.060 --> 1:32:38.540]  because the left, which is the ideology
[1:32:38.540 --> 1:32:41.220]  of this world government system couldn't win,
[1:32:41.220 --> 1:32:44.220]  they released a biological weapon on us.
[1:32:44.220 --> 1:32:46.380]  Now we know two years ago,
[1:32:46.380 --> 1:32:48.540]  we learned about it about 20 months ago.
[1:32:48.540 --> 1:32:49.380]  It's that simple.
[1:32:49.380 --> 1:32:52.220]  They can't meet us because of our free speech and our guns.
[1:32:52.220 --> 1:32:54.980]  So the global corporate combine released COVID-19
[1:32:54.980 --> 1:32:56.380]  and you know the rest is history.
[1:32:56.380 --> 1:32:58.180]  Expose this paradigm and we win.
[1:33:00.180 --> 1:33:03.020]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[1:33:03.020 --> 1:33:06.580]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[1:33:06.580 --> 1:33:09.580]  The World's First Info Wars
[1:33:09.580 --> 1:33:12.580]  The World's First Info Wars
[1:33:12.580 --> 1:33:15.580]  The World's First Info Wars
[1:33:15.580 --> 1:33:19.580]  Live from the InfoWars.com Studios,
[1:33:19.580 --> 1:33:22.580]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:22.580 --> 1:33:25.580]  You want to see total proof that COVID-19
[1:33:25.580 --> 1:33:27.580]  is a power grab and a way for governments
[1:33:27.580 --> 1:33:31.580]  to grandstand and make the whole public suspects
[1:33:31.580 --> 1:33:35.580]  so they can bring in a police state global control grid.
[1:33:35.580 --> 1:33:37.580]  Now we got the proof right here
[1:33:37.580 --> 1:33:40.580]  and I'm going to get to it in just a moment.
[1:33:40.580 --> 1:33:44.580]  CDC data, fentanyl overdoses now kill more Americans
[1:33:44.580 --> 1:33:48.580]  ages 18 to 45 than COVID, cancer and car accidents
[1:33:48.580 --> 1:33:52.580]  and suicide combined and kill more, period.
[1:33:55.580 --> 1:33:58.580]  When you're just counting fentanyl versus COVID.
[1:33:59.580 --> 1:34:01.580]  Unbelievable, but oh my gosh,
[1:34:01.580 --> 1:34:03.580]  you think it was the end of the world every day.
[1:34:03.580 --> 1:34:07.580]  Meanwhile, the Postal Service doesn't look through the mail,
[1:34:07.580 --> 1:34:10.580]  which they should be doing anyways, for fentanyl.
[1:34:10.580 --> 1:34:12.580]  They look for ivermectin that's totally safe
[1:34:12.580 --> 1:34:14.580]  because they want you to die
[1:34:14.580 --> 1:34:18.580]  because they follow the orders of the technocrats.
[1:34:18.580 --> 1:34:21.580]  It's all done in corporate contracts that quote,
[1:34:21.580 --> 1:34:24.580]  Pfizer quote controls the government
[1:34:24.580 --> 1:34:27.580]  and quote controls the media.
[1:34:27.580 --> 1:34:29.580]  And they slip up in Reuters today and go,
[1:34:29.580 --> 1:34:32.580]  yeah, that's why the UN doesn't give any of the migrants
[1:34:32.580 --> 1:34:35.580]  shots because the UN is the co-shareholder
[1:34:35.580 --> 1:34:37.580]  in this with Fauci and Gates
[1:34:37.580 --> 1:34:39.580]  and they don't want to get sued themselves.
[1:34:39.580 --> 1:34:42.580]  They just give the liability to the taxpayers they're killing.
[1:34:43.580 --> 1:34:45.580]  So let's get back to raping.
[1:34:45.580 --> 1:34:48.580]  You know, we think of rape as just a physical act
[1:34:48.580 --> 1:34:51.580]  of somebody coming and holding you down
[1:34:51.580 --> 1:34:55.580]  and trying to force sex on you, which is terrible.
[1:34:57.580 --> 1:34:59.580]  But there's financial rape.
[1:34:59.580 --> 1:35:01.580]  There's psychological rape.
[1:35:01.580 --> 1:35:04.580]  There's biological GMO rape
[1:35:04.580 --> 1:35:06.580]  turning you into a GMO creature
[1:35:06.580 --> 1:35:09.580]  with these deadly shots that masquerade as vaccines.
[1:35:09.580 --> 1:35:12.580]  And the list goes on and on and on.
[1:35:12.580 --> 1:35:15.580]  There's articles out today about the metaverse.
[1:35:15.580 --> 1:35:17.580]  Oh my gosh, here it is.
[1:35:20.580 --> 1:35:22.580]  Oh, there's big articles in Wired,
[1:35:22.580 --> 1:35:25.580]  the New York Times and Technology Review.
[1:35:25.580 --> 1:35:28.580]  The metaverse has a groping problem already.
[1:35:28.580 --> 1:35:31.580]  Yeah, it's probably the person saying they were groped
[1:35:31.580 --> 1:35:33.580]  with another avatar and they're doing it themselves.
[1:35:33.580 --> 1:35:36.580]  I mean, I'm not saying in this case, but most of it's false flags.
[1:35:36.580 --> 1:35:39.580]  Oh my gosh, someone groped your avatar.
[1:35:39.580 --> 1:35:42.580]  So you go in a fantasy world and somebody bumps into you
[1:35:42.580 --> 1:35:45.580]  and then you get to freak out and say you were raped.
[1:35:48.580 --> 1:35:51.580]  But nobody cares about the real rapes.
[1:35:51.580 --> 1:35:53.580]  No, no, no, when you expose the real rape,
[1:35:53.580 --> 1:35:56.580]  allegedly in her diary that confirms real,
[1:35:56.580 --> 1:36:01.580]  of Biden's youngest daughter
[1:36:01.580 --> 1:36:05.580]  saying my father had sex with me, but I blacked it out.
[1:36:05.580 --> 1:36:07.580]  That's why I take all these drugs.
[1:36:07.580 --> 1:36:10.580]  That's all confirmed real, but he's not the one that's bad,
[1:36:10.580 --> 1:36:11.580]  the public president.
[1:36:11.580 --> 1:36:14.580]  No, no, no, no, it's James O'Keefe.
[1:36:14.580 --> 1:36:16.580]  Confirmed.
[1:36:16.580 --> 1:36:19.580]  The actually Biden diary's real, but the FBI only cares
[1:36:19.580 --> 1:36:22.580]  about investigating Project Veritas, redstate.com reports.
[1:36:22.580 --> 1:36:24.580]  Oh, but don't worry.
[1:36:24.580 --> 1:36:26.580]  There's a metaverse groping problem.
[1:36:26.580 --> 1:36:28.580]  Yes.
[1:36:28.580 --> 1:36:30.580]  Yes, yes, yes.
[1:36:30.580 --> 1:36:32.580]  Gotta make it all real in there.
[1:36:32.580 --> 1:36:35.580]  I was raped by 150 men.
[1:36:35.580 --> 1:36:40.580]  Young woman claims grooming gangs at large and whole.
[1:36:40.580 --> 1:36:41.580]  That's in the UK.
[1:36:41.580 --> 1:36:44.580]  And of course, it was first Tommy Robinson
[1:36:44.580 --> 1:36:46.580]  that exposed that 15 years ago.
[1:36:46.580 --> 1:36:48.580]  All confirmed now, including many girls,
[1:36:48.580 --> 1:36:50.580]  murdered and chopped up,
[1:36:50.580 --> 1:36:53.580]  but the Muslims that they called Asian grooming gangs,
[1:36:53.580 --> 1:36:55.580]  scapegoating poor Asians,
[1:36:58.580 --> 1:36:59.580]  didn't have it.
[1:36:59.580 --> 1:37:03.580]  They had kebab shops of supposedly sheep meat.
[1:37:03.580 --> 1:37:05.580]  Was it sheep meat?
[1:37:05.580 --> 1:37:07.580]  You're like, man, that sounds incredible.
[1:37:07.580 --> 1:37:08.580]  Yeah, it is incredible what criminals do
[1:37:08.580 --> 1:37:10.580]  when governments protect them.
[1:37:10.580 --> 1:37:12.580]  And it wasn't just the Pakistani men
[1:37:12.580 --> 1:37:14.580]  running these kidnapping rings.
[1:37:14.580 --> 1:37:16.580]  The police and judges were involved
[1:37:16.580 --> 1:37:18.580]  and they were dropping by to rape them as well.
[1:37:18.580 --> 1:37:20.580]  There's plenty of white dudes involved.
[1:37:20.580 --> 1:37:22.580]  In fact, they were running it.
[1:37:22.580 --> 1:37:25.580]  I mean, look at Prince Charles and Jimmy Savelle.
[1:37:25.580 --> 1:37:27.580]  Let's not just blame the Pakistanis,
[1:37:27.580 --> 1:37:29.580]  though they have a big problem and do it as well
[1:37:29.580 --> 1:37:32.580]  and are absolutely, their business is pimping
[1:37:32.580 --> 1:37:36.580]  little British girls and Scottish girls and Irish girls.
[1:37:36.580 --> 1:37:40.580]  I was raped by 150 men.
[1:37:40.580 --> 1:37:43.580]  And it goes on to how the government covered it up.
[1:37:43.580 --> 1:37:45.580]  That's just in one town.
[1:37:45.580 --> 1:37:48.580]  Great-grandparents who reported lesbian couple in the UK
[1:37:48.580 --> 1:37:51.580]  for abusing toddler with dismisses racist,
[1:37:51.580 --> 1:37:54.580]  they then beat the little girl's brains out.
[1:37:57.580 --> 1:37:59.580]  Even when they came to the house and the child was dizzy
[1:37:59.580 --> 1:38:01.580]  and couldn't walk at age three
[1:38:01.580 --> 1:38:03.580]  and had blood coming out of her nose,
[1:38:03.580 --> 1:38:05.580]  they just said it's okay.
[1:38:05.580 --> 1:38:07.580]  They said right-wingers have reported
[1:38:07.580 --> 1:38:09.580]  as the grandparents are bad Christians.
[1:38:09.580 --> 1:38:11.580]  And basically the local tabulator said,
[1:38:11.580 --> 1:38:13.580]  get the killin' goin'.
[1:38:13.580 --> 1:38:15.580]  It's murder time.
[1:38:15.580 --> 1:38:16.580]  Just like this one.
[1:38:16.580 --> 1:38:20.580]  Mother and lesbian lover tear off nine-year-old son's penis
[1:38:20.580 --> 1:38:24.580]  then behead him as he reminded them of Dad.
[1:38:28.580 --> 1:38:30.580]  Dismissed his racist homophobes.
[1:38:30.580 --> 1:38:35.580]  The family who tried to save Star Hobson was the baby's name.
[1:38:35.580 --> 1:38:38.580]  Toddler's injuries were ignored five times by social services
[1:38:38.580 --> 1:38:41.580]  after gypsy lesbian stepmother convinced workers,
[1:38:41.580 --> 1:38:45.580]  great-grandparents who raised alarm were just troublemakers.
[1:38:45.580 --> 1:38:47.580]  And you know they won't serve any jail time.
[1:38:47.580 --> 1:38:50.580]  They committed a sacrament.
[1:38:50.580 --> 1:38:52.580]  The murder of a little girl.
[1:38:52.580 --> 1:38:54.580]  Game on, victory.
[1:38:56.580 --> 1:38:59.580]  And then it gets more liberal.
[1:38:59.580 --> 1:39:02.580]  Stories up on infowars.com from Reclaim the Net.
[1:39:02.580 --> 1:39:08.580]  Twitter locked out think tank policy director
[1:39:08.580 --> 1:39:11.580]  for opposing chemical castration of children.
[1:39:11.580 --> 1:39:14.580]  The major accredited think tank said it's abusive
[1:39:14.580 --> 1:39:17.580]  to trick little children to saying they're having a sex change
[1:39:17.580 --> 1:39:19.580]  and then take parental rights away
[1:39:19.580 --> 1:39:21.580]  and physically or chemically castrate them.
[1:39:21.580 --> 1:39:24.580]  That's abusive and governments need to get involved in banning.
[1:39:24.580 --> 1:39:26.580]  And Twitter said, you're not allowed to lobby
[1:39:26.580 --> 1:39:28.580]  and stop our transhumanist movement.
[1:39:28.580 --> 1:39:30.580]  We're gonna get those ovaries.
[1:39:30.580 --> 1:39:32.580]  We're gonna get those testicles.
[1:39:32.580 --> 1:39:34.580]  And the thousands of surgeries now in the U.S. every year
[1:39:34.580 --> 1:39:37.580]  of 12-year-olds having their breasts cut off,
[1:39:37.580 --> 1:39:39.580]  having a woman say, you're really a man.
[1:39:39.580 --> 1:39:41.580]  Go cut those off.
[1:39:41.580 --> 1:39:43.580]  See the demon, cut them off.
[1:39:43.580 --> 1:39:45.580]  Show us how you get all the attention.
[1:39:45.580 --> 1:39:46.580]  Now, cut those breasts off.
[1:39:46.580 --> 1:39:47.580]  Cut that genitals.
[1:39:47.580 --> 1:39:48.580]  Cut those off.
[1:39:48.580 --> 1:39:50.580]  Liberal!
[1:39:50.580 --> 1:39:52.580]  You'll watch a Hellraiser
[1:39:52.580 --> 1:39:55.580]  or you go watch Event Horizon 30 years ago.
[1:39:55.580 --> 1:39:56.580]  It's like, oh, shocking.
[1:39:56.580 --> 1:39:58.580]  The demons want to cut your genitals off.
[1:39:58.580 --> 1:40:00.580]  And the real world's like, it's for your children.
[1:40:00.580 --> 1:40:02.580]  See?
[1:40:04.580 --> 1:40:06.580]  And it goes on.
[1:40:06.580 --> 1:40:07.580]  See?
[1:40:07.580 --> 1:40:10.580]  They got banned from John Schweppi.
[1:40:10.580 --> 1:40:12.580]  He said, now we hope that
[1:40:12.580 --> 1:40:14.580]  governors will likewise be emboldened
[1:40:14.580 --> 1:40:16.580]  to continue the fight against the
[1:40:16.580 --> 1:40:18.580]  evil gender ideology being forced
[1:40:18.580 --> 1:40:20.580]  in American children by joining
[1:40:20.580 --> 1:40:22.580]  Arkansas and Tennessee
[1:40:22.580 --> 1:40:24.580]  in banning the chemical castration
[1:40:24.580 --> 1:40:26.580]  and surgical mutilation of minor suffering
[1:40:26.580 --> 1:40:28.580]  from gender dysphoria.
[1:40:28.580 --> 1:40:30.580]  And now you know
[1:40:30.580 --> 1:40:32.580]  how they call Biden the pedophile
[1:40:32.580 --> 1:40:34.580]  because he is.
[1:40:34.580 --> 1:40:36.580]  But it's more than just wanting to have
[1:40:36.580 --> 1:40:37.580]  sex with children.
[1:40:37.580 --> 1:40:39.580]  That's old school.
[1:40:39.580 --> 1:40:41.580]  Now you inject him with deadly GMO
[1:40:41.580 --> 1:40:42.580]  that gives him heart attacks
[1:40:42.580 --> 1:40:44.580]  and brain damage and the rest of it.
[1:40:44.580 --> 1:40:46.580]  And now you get $60,000
[1:40:46.580 --> 1:40:48.580]  because your Senator Ron Wyden,
[1:40:48.580 --> 1:40:49.580]  who's called for me to quote,
[1:40:49.580 --> 1:40:51.580]  be taken off the air to save America,
[1:40:51.580 --> 1:40:53.580]  he's involved in lawsuits
[1:40:53.580 --> 1:40:55.580]  to shut us, take us off the air.
[1:40:55.580 --> 1:40:57.580]  And now you know
[1:40:57.580 --> 1:40:59.580]  he wants to shut us, take us off the air.
[1:40:59.580 --> 1:41:01.580]  This man got $60,000
[1:41:01.580 --> 1:41:03.580]  to block a law saying
[1:41:03.580 --> 1:41:05.580]  you can't have forced labor including
[1:41:05.580 --> 1:41:07.580]  children who work
[1:41:07.580 --> 1:41:09.580]  18 hours a day and they're killed
[1:41:09.580 --> 1:41:11.580]  if they cause a problem.
[1:41:11.580 --> 1:41:13.580]  But it's okay because he's Ron Wyden
[1:41:13.580 --> 1:41:15.580]  for $60,000.
[1:41:17.580 --> 1:41:19.580]  Hell, they get $53,000
[1:41:19.580 --> 1:41:21.580]  to intubate somebody and kill them in a hospital.
[1:41:21.580 --> 1:41:23.580]  Look how cheap he was.
[1:41:23.580 --> 1:41:25.580]  $60,000.
[1:41:25.580 --> 1:41:27.580]  Now they pay him that every year,
[1:41:27.580 --> 1:41:29.580]  but oh, you gave me $60,000?
[1:41:29.580 --> 1:41:31.580]  Well I'm going to sign on to death camp
[1:41:31.580 --> 1:41:33.580]  because I'm not Alex Jones.
[1:41:33.580 --> 1:41:35.580]  The real moral thing when you're Ron Wyden
[1:41:35.580 --> 1:41:37.580]  or the lawyers involved
[1:41:37.580 --> 1:41:39.580]  trying to shut down free speech
[1:41:39.580 --> 1:41:41.580]  is to say you're Alex Jones
[1:41:41.580 --> 1:41:43.580]  and then it's like you've done your sacrifice
[1:41:43.580 --> 1:41:45.580]  at the temple. Then you get engaged
[1:41:45.580 --> 1:41:47.580]  in whatever crime you want.
[1:41:47.580 --> 1:41:49.580]  Oh, you're the ADL?
[1:41:49.580 --> 1:41:51.580]  Come out and defend George Soros, the Nazi collaborator
[1:41:51.580 --> 1:41:53.580]  buying off and putting in
[1:41:53.580 --> 1:41:55.580]  county attorneys and city attorneys.
[1:41:55.580 --> 1:41:57.580]  And then when Fox comes out and says,
[1:41:57.580 --> 1:41:59.580]  oh look, he's buying them off. Oh my God,
[1:41:59.580 --> 1:42:01.580]  you're anti-Semitic. You're not allowed to say
[1:42:01.580 --> 1:42:03.580]  he's buying them off even though he is.
[1:42:03.580 --> 1:42:05.580]  It's disgusting.
[1:42:07.580 --> 1:42:09.580]  And if I was Jewish,
[1:42:09.580 --> 1:42:11.580]  I would be really upset at the ADL
[1:42:11.580 --> 1:42:13.580]  running around committing these cultural crimes
[1:42:13.580 --> 1:42:15.580]  in your name and
[1:42:15.580 --> 1:42:17.580]  I know a lot of folks are upset about that.
[1:42:17.580 --> 1:42:19.580]  Very sick.
[1:42:19.580 --> 1:42:21.580]  We're going to go to the break. We're going to come back.
[1:42:21.580 --> 1:42:23.580]  We're going to go to the studio coming up.
[1:42:23.580 --> 1:42:25.580]  Good friend of mine.
[1:42:25.580 --> 1:42:27.580]  But first, more COVID news as I promised.
[1:42:27.580 --> 1:42:29.580]  There's so much of it.
[1:42:29.580 --> 1:42:31.580]  CDC data,
[1:42:31.580 --> 1:42:33.580]  fentanyl overdoses now kill more Americans
[1:42:33.580 --> 1:42:35.580]  ages 18 to 45
[1:42:35.580 --> 1:42:37.580]  than COVID cancer,
[1:42:37.580 --> 1:42:39.580]  car accidents and suicide.
[1:42:39.580 --> 1:42:41.580]  And no matter what happens to me,
[1:42:41.580 --> 1:42:43.580]  whether the January 6th committee puts me in prison
[1:42:43.580 --> 1:42:45.580]  or whatever happens, I'm not going to talk about Alex Jones
[1:42:45.580 --> 1:42:47.580]  the whole time. I'm going to talk about the pedophilia
[1:42:47.580 --> 1:42:49.580]  and the fentanyl and the rest of it.
[1:42:49.580 --> 1:42:51.580]  And they don't care about that
[1:42:51.580 --> 1:42:53.580]  because the same people shipping and fentanyl gave you COVID.
[1:42:57.580 --> 1:42:59.580]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:42:59.580 --> 1:43:01.580]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[1:43:01.580 --> 1:43:03.580]  Welcome. Hello, Alex. Yes, Malcolm.
[1:43:03.580 --> 1:43:05.580]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[1:43:05.580 --> 1:43:07.580]  where the other patriots can get on the line.
[1:43:07.580 --> 1:43:09.580]  Alex, I have to promote one thing
[1:43:09.580 --> 1:43:11.580]  from one of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[1:43:11.580 --> 1:43:13.580]  Supermail volatility
[1:43:13.580 --> 1:43:15.580]  and Brainforce Plus. Mix those two together.
[1:43:15.580 --> 1:43:17.580]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[1:43:17.580 --> 1:43:19.580]  Supermail volatility really, really works.
[1:43:19.580 --> 1:43:21.580]  It's cold pressed herbs
[1:43:21.580 --> 1:43:23.580]  and natural compounds that have never been heated up.
[1:43:23.580 --> 1:43:25.580]  And so it has
[1:43:25.580 --> 1:43:27.580]  a dramatic effect compared to
[1:43:27.580 --> 1:43:29.580]  powdered versions that also work quite well
[1:43:29.580 --> 1:43:31.580]  that just aren't as strong.
[1:43:31.580 --> 1:43:33.580]  This is like a very fine wine.
[1:43:33.580 --> 1:43:35.580]  In fact, each batch is different.
[1:43:35.580 --> 1:43:37.580]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay.
[1:43:37.580 --> 1:43:39.580]  People are like, why are you selling something
[1:43:39.580 --> 1:43:41.580]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong?
[1:43:41.580 --> 1:43:43.580]  That's just how it is. It's how it works.
[1:43:43.580 --> 1:43:45.580]  So it's always good.
[1:43:45.580 --> 1:43:47.580]  Sometimes it's like super strong.
[1:43:47.580 --> 1:43:49.580]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce
[1:43:49.580 --> 1:43:51.580]  at a decent price, then this is it.
[1:43:57.580 --> 1:44:00.580]  If you're ruthless mega corporations
[1:44:00.580 --> 1:44:02.580]  who've taken over almost every government on earth
[1:44:02.580 --> 1:44:05.580]  and who are trying to destroy the middle class
[1:44:05.580 --> 1:44:07.580]  in any form of upward mobility,
[1:44:07.580 --> 1:44:09.580]  you've got to divide and conquer the public
[1:44:09.580 --> 1:44:11.580]  so they don't know they're being targeted.
[1:44:11.580 --> 1:44:13.580]  And that's why the Fortune 100
[1:44:13.580 --> 1:44:15.580]  have wrapped themselves, the name of LBGT
[1:44:15.580 --> 1:44:17.580]  and African American rights
[1:44:17.580 --> 1:44:19.580]  and all the rest of it all over the world.
[1:44:19.580 --> 1:44:21.580]  That's now their corporate face
[1:44:21.580 --> 1:44:23.580]  while they run slave camps in Africa
[1:44:23.580 --> 1:44:25.580]  and in Communist China and many other areas
[1:44:25.580 --> 1:44:27.580]  while they undermine our basic liberties here
[1:44:27.580 --> 1:44:29.580]  and spy on us through the big tech
[1:44:29.580 --> 1:44:31.580]  of the central banks and other zone.
[1:44:31.580 --> 1:44:33.580]  So this is a criminal takeover
[1:44:33.580 --> 1:44:35.580]  and when you look at the new
[1:44:35.580 --> 1:44:37.580]  super class, it's the politicians,
[1:44:37.580 --> 1:44:39.580]  it's the corporate media,
[1:44:39.580 --> 1:44:41.580]  it's the police, it's the bureaucrats,
[1:44:41.580 --> 1:44:43.580]  it's members of Congress and their staff
[1:44:43.580 --> 1:44:45.580]  and their families, it's the White House,
[1:44:45.580 --> 1:44:47.580]  hell, it's postal workers
[1:44:47.580 --> 1:44:51.580]  who were all exempt from the poison shots
[1:44:51.580 --> 1:44:53.580]  but not the general public and everybody else
[1:44:53.580 --> 1:44:55.580]  through corporate rule.
[1:44:55.580 --> 1:44:57.580]  So this is the true discrimination that's going on.
[1:44:57.580 --> 1:44:59.580]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep
[1:44:59.580 --> 1:45:01.580]  is the cornerstone of good health.
[1:45:01.580 --> 1:45:03.580]  It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule
[1:45:03.580 --> 1:45:05.580]  is linked with numerous health problems
[1:45:05.580 --> 1:45:07.580]  including weight gain, memory issues,
[1:45:07.580 --> 1:45:09.580]  mood changes, poor concentration
[1:45:09.580 --> 1:45:11.580]  and even a weakened immune system.
[1:45:11.580 --> 1:45:13.580]  Introducing RocketRest,
[1:45:13.580 --> 1:45:15.580]  the new product from our Dr. Jones
[1:45:15.580 --> 1:45:17.580]  Naturals line at infowarstore.com.
[1:45:17.580 --> 1:45:19.580]  The new RocketRest formula is loaded

[1:45:21.580 --> 1:45:23.580]  to help not only improve your quality of sleep
[1:45:23.580 --> 1:45:25.580]  but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[1:45:25.580 --> 1:45:27.580]  Many competitor sleep formulas
[1:45:27.580 --> 1:45:29.580]  focus only on getting you to sleep
[1:45:29.580 --> 1:45:31.580]  but RocketRest was specifically formulated
[1:45:31.580 --> 1:45:33.580]  to help you feel rested
[1:45:33.580 --> 1:45:35.580]  and ready to take on the next day.
[1:45:35.580 --> 1:45:37.580]  It uses a unique quick release
[1:45:37.580 --> 1:45:39.580]  capsule system
[1:45:39.580 --> 1:45:41.580]  to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep
[1:45:41.580 --> 1:45:43.580]  support ingredients like melatonin
[1:45:43.580 --> 1:45:45.580]  and magnesium.
[1:45:45.580 --> 1:45:47.580]  RocketRest helps you fall asleep fast,
[1:45:47.580 --> 1:45:49.580]  stay asleep and wake up feeling rested.
[1:45:49.580 --> 1:45:51.580]  So get the new RocketRest formula
[1:45:51.580 --> 1:45:53.580]  from Dr. Jones Naturals right now
[1:45:53.580 --> 1:45:55.580]  at infowarstore.com
[1:45:55.580 --> 1:45:57.580]  so you're ready to take off.
[1:45:57.580 --> 1:45:59.580]  The purpose of fear is to call us
[1:45:59.580 --> 1:46:01.580]  into action and there is plenty
[1:46:01.580 --> 1:46:03.580]  to be afraid of today.
[1:46:03.580 --> 1:46:05.580]  Half the population has lined up
[1:46:05.580 --> 1:46:07.580]  untested, deadly and debilitating
[1:46:07.580 --> 1:46:09.580]  experimental injection
[1:46:09.580 --> 1:46:11.580]  because they were told to be afraid
[1:46:11.580 --> 1:46:13.580]  of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[1:46:13.580 --> 1:46:15.580]  The perpetrators of all this
[1:46:15.580 --> 1:46:17.580]  have clearly stated their goal
[1:46:17.580 --> 1:46:19.580]  of having 80% of the population
[1:46:19.580 --> 1:46:21.580]  hooked up to an artificial intelligence
[1:46:21.580 --> 1:46:23.580]  hive mind in less than nine years.
[1:46:23.580 --> 1:46:25.580]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell
[1:46:25.580 --> 1:46:27.580]  we know this is all really happening
[1:46:27.580 --> 1:46:29.580]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see
[1:46:29.580 --> 1:46:31.580]  but there is only two things to do.
[1:46:31.580 --> 1:46:33.580]  We continue sounding the alarm
[1:46:33.580 --> 1:46:35.580]  because it's a numbers game.
[1:46:35.580 --> 1:46:37.580]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell
[1:46:37.580 --> 1:46:39.580]  then we win.
[1:46:39.580 --> 1:46:41.580]  But even when we win and we eventually will
[1:46:41.580 --> 1:46:43.580]  the days of convenience are soon coming
[1:46:43.580 --> 1:46:45.580]  to an end and so we must
[1:46:45.580 --> 1:46:47.580]  prepare, get up to a year's worth of
[1:46:47.580 --> 1:46:49.580]  storable foods, water filtration,
[1:46:49.580 --> 1:46:51.580]  survival gear, seeds,
[1:46:51.580 --> 1:46:53.580]  shortwave radios
[1:46:53.580 --> 1:46:55.580]  and life-saving knowledge
[1:46:55.580 --> 1:46:57.580]  at infowarstore.com
[1:46:59.580 --> 1:47:01.580]  Leading a frontal assault
[1:47:01.580 --> 1:47:03.580]  on the lies of the New World Order
[1:47:03.580 --> 1:47:05.580]  it's Alex Jones
[1:47:13.580 --> 1:47:15.580]  Mind control
[1:47:21.580 --> 1:47:23.580]  There's my mom and son
[1:47:23.580 --> 1:47:25.580]  decades ago singing about mind control
[1:47:25.580 --> 1:47:27.580]  I certainly know what they're talking about
[1:47:29.580 --> 1:47:31.580]  Corruption of your soul
[1:47:31.580 --> 1:47:33.580]  See
[1:47:35.580 --> 1:47:37.580]  Corruption of your mind
[1:47:37.580 --> 1:47:39.580]  Corruption of your soul
[1:47:43.580 --> 1:47:45.580]  Two different ways to look at the same thing
[1:47:45.580 --> 1:47:47.580]  Mind control
[1:47:49.580 --> 1:47:51.580]  Causes your defeat
[1:47:51.580 --> 1:47:53.580]  Manipulate your intention
[1:47:53.580 --> 1:47:55.580]  That guy's giving me the
[1:47:55.580 --> 1:47:57.580]  transcript of this
[1:47:57.580 --> 1:47:59.580]  Very powerful
[1:47:59.580 --> 1:48:01.580]  Sounds like reset wars
[1:48:01.580 --> 1:48:03.580]  Bob Marley didn't invent that
[1:48:03.580 --> 1:48:05.580]  His son didn't invent it
[1:48:05.580 --> 1:48:07.580]  I didn't invent it
[1:48:07.580 --> 1:48:09.580]  God did
[1:48:09.580 --> 1:48:11.580]  Mind control
[1:48:11.580 --> 1:48:13.580]  Corruption of your soul
[1:48:15.580 --> 1:48:17.580]  Corruption of your thoughts and souls
[1:48:17.580 --> 1:48:19.580]  First the thoughts
[1:48:19.580 --> 1:48:21.580]  to get access to the soul
[1:48:21.580 --> 1:48:23.580]  First the thoughts
[1:48:23.580 --> 1:48:25.580]  then the soul
[1:48:25.580 --> 1:48:27.580]  Reset wars
[1:48:27.580 --> 1:48:29.580]  This is what it's really all about
[1:48:29.580 --> 1:48:31.580]  I think Bob Marley broke out of this stuff
[1:48:31.580 --> 1:48:33.580]  I think they killed him
[1:48:33.580 --> 1:48:35.580]  with a nice cancer
[1:48:39.580 --> 1:48:41.580]  Put them into total confusion
[1:48:41.580 --> 1:48:43.580]  To destroy
[1:48:43.580 --> 1:48:47.580]  their soul
[1:48:47.580 --> 1:48:49.580]  Practice what you preach
[1:49:05.580 --> 1:49:07.580]  We ought to try to get him on the show
[1:49:07.580 --> 1:49:09.580]  I never actually tried before
[1:49:09.580 --> 1:49:13.580]  Let's put it back on screen
[1:49:13.580 --> 1:49:15.580]  Let me just read the lyrics
[1:49:17.580 --> 1:49:19.580]  Now tell me what
[1:49:19.580 --> 1:49:21.580]  It's mind control
[1:49:21.580 --> 1:49:23.580]  Mind control
[1:49:23.580 --> 1:49:25.580]  Corruption of your thoughts
[1:49:25.580 --> 1:49:27.580]  Yeah, destruction of your soul
[1:49:27.580 --> 1:49:29.580]  Mind control
[1:49:29.580 --> 1:49:31.580]  Corruption of your thoughts
[1:49:31.580 --> 1:49:33.580]  Don't let them mold your mind
[1:49:33.580 --> 1:49:35.580]  They want to control mankind
[1:49:35.580 --> 1:49:37.580]  Seems like
[1:49:37.580 --> 1:49:39.580]  Their only intention is to exploit the earth
[1:49:39.580 --> 1:49:41.580]  Yeah, see, aliens
[1:49:41.580 --> 1:49:43.580]  See, he's got the transmission
[1:49:43.580 --> 1:49:45.580]  And you trust in their deceit
[1:49:45.580 --> 1:49:47.580]  People taking the shots
[1:49:47.580 --> 1:49:49.580]  Your mind causes your defeat
[1:49:49.580 --> 1:49:51.580]  And so you become
[1:49:51.580 --> 1:49:53.580]  An invention
[1:49:53.580 --> 1:49:55.580]  To distort the earth
[1:49:55.580 --> 1:49:57.580]  Wow, I mean that's total Holy Spirit right there
[1:49:57.580 --> 1:49:59.580]  You're becoming their creature
[1:49:59.580 --> 1:50:01.580]  Their GMO creature
[1:50:01.580 --> 1:50:03.580]  Propaganda and lies
[1:50:03.580 --> 1:50:05.580]  It's a plague in our lives
[1:50:05.580 --> 1:50:07.580]  How much more victimized
[1:50:07.580 --> 1:50:09.580]  Before we realize, hey
[1:50:09.580 --> 1:50:11.580]  It's mind control
[1:50:11.580 --> 1:50:13.580]  Corruption of our thoughts
[1:50:13.580 --> 1:50:15.580]  Yeah, destruction of our soul
[1:50:15.580 --> 1:50:17.580]  It's mind control
[1:50:17.580 --> 1:50:19.580]  Corruption of your thoughts
[1:50:19.580 --> 1:50:21.580]  Yeah, destruction of your soul
[1:50:21.580 --> 1:50:23.580]  That's how they get through, it's through the mind
[1:50:23.580 --> 1:50:25.580]  Oh, grandmaster, let the people go
[1:50:25.580 --> 1:50:27.580]  You put them in total confusion
[1:50:29.580 --> 1:50:31.580]  To destroy their soul
[1:50:31.580 --> 1:50:33.580]  For they practice what you preach
[1:50:33.580 --> 1:50:35.580]  So they're always in your reach
[1:50:35.580 --> 1:50:37.580]  High-tech slavery in these days
[1:50:37.580 --> 1:50:39.580]  Is mind control
[1:50:39.580 --> 1:50:41.580]  This is 20 years old, folks
[1:50:41.580 --> 1:50:43.580]  They'll make it attractive
[1:50:43.580 --> 1:50:45.580]  To get man distracted
[1:50:45.580 --> 1:50:47.580]  That's the 5G, that's the metaverse
[1:50:47.580 --> 1:50:49.580]  Corrupting your soul, polluting your soul
[1:50:49.580 --> 1:50:51.580]  Destroying your soul, mind control
[1:50:51.580 --> 1:50:53.580]  Mind control, corruption of your thoughts
[1:50:53.580 --> 1:50:55.580]  Yeah, destruction of your soul
[1:50:55.580 --> 1:50:57.580]  Mind control, it's mind control
[1:50:57.580 --> 1:50:59.580]  Corruption of your thoughts, yeah
[1:50:59.580 --> 1:51:01.580]  Destruction of your soul, yeah, yeah, yeah
[1:51:01.580 --> 1:51:03.580]  Yeah, yeah, yeah
[1:51:03.580 --> 1:51:05.580]  Come on and get it together, brother
[1:51:05.580 --> 1:51:07.580]  Man, what?
[1:51:07.580 --> 1:51:09.580]  What you say? You gonna wake up?
[1:51:09.580 --> 1:51:11.580]  You gonna go along with this?
[1:51:11.580 --> 1:51:13.580]  It's mind control, mind control
[1:51:13.580 --> 1:51:15.580]  Corruption of your thoughts, yeah, yeah
[1:51:15.580 --> 1:51:17.580]  Destruction of your soul, mind control
[1:51:17.580 --> 1:51:19.580]  It's mind control, corruption of your thoughts
[1:51:19.580 --> 1:51:21.580]  Destruction of your soul
[1:51:21.580 --> 1:51:23.580]  The truth is there for us to see
[1:51:23.580 --> 1:51:25.580]  It's mind control
[1:51:25.580 --> 1:51:27.580]  Corruption of your thoughts, yeah
[1:51:27.580 --> 1:51:29.580]  Destruction of your soul
[1:51:29.580 --> 1:51:31.580]  It's mind control
[1:51:31.580 --> 1:51:33.580]  Corruption of your thoughts, yeah
[1:51:33.580 --> 1:51:35.580]  Destruction of your soul, the truth is there for us to see
[1:51:35.580 --> 1:51:37.580]  The truth is there for us to see
[1:51:41.580 --> 1:51:43.580]  Bob Marley, Rasta don't work for no CIA
[1:51:43.580 --> 1:51:45.580]  Well, you're dead
[1:51:47.580 --> 1:51:49.580]  So that's what this is, ladies and gentlemen
[1:51:51.580 --> 1:51:53.580]  And that's where we are right now
[1:51:53.580 --> 1:51:55.580]  This is not a game, this is not a joke
[1:51:55.580 --> 1:51:57.580]  This is deadly serious
[1:51:57.580 --> 1:51:59.580]  They get control of your mind
[1:51:59.580 --> 1:52:01.580]  To destroy your soul
[1:52:01.580 --> 1:52:03.580]  First they come for your mind
[1:52:03.580 --> 1:52:05.580]  First they capture your mind
[1:52:05.580 --> 1:52:07.580]  Then they come for your soul
[1:52:07.580 --> 1:52:09.580]  That's in reset wars
[1:52:09.580 --> 1:52:11.580]  And we've just put together
[1:52:11.580 --> 1:52:13.580]  In six plus hours how it really works
[1:52:13.580 --> 1:52:15.580]  How the enemy sees it and how God sees it
[1:52:15.580 --> 1:52:17.580]  So you can get the knowledge of good and evil
[1:52:17.580 --> 1:52:19.580]  Which you were already born into
[1:52:19.580 --> 1:52:21.580]  But this is like a manual
[1:52:21.580 --> 1:52:23.580]  This is actually the tree of life
[1:52:23.580 --> 1:52:25.580]  This is actually the forbidden fruit
[1:52:25.580 --> 1:52:27.580]  And I explained that, this is dangerous
[1:52:27.580 --> 1:52:29.580]  To even put this out folks
[1:52:29.580 --> 1:52:31.580]  But you already are born into it
[1:52:31.580 --> 1:52:33.580]  It was already done by our ancestors
[1:52:33.580 --> 1:52:35.580]  We already went from the knowledge of just good
[1:52:35.580 --> 1:52:37.580]  To knowing how evil works, so this is how it works
[1:52:37.580 --> 1:52:39.580]  When you're perfect to connect it to God
[1:52:39.580 --> 1:52:41.580]  You didn't even know how you were connected
[1:52:41.580 --> 1:52:43.580]  You didn't even know you were perfect
[1:52:43.580 --> 1:52:45.580]  But they cut in, they spliced in, they took control
[1:52:45.580 --> 1:52:47.580]  So now you've got to have the knowledge of that evil
[1:52:47.580 --> 1:52:49.580]  Because if you don't have the knowledge of good and evil
[1:52:49.580 --> 1:52:51.580]  You're born to good and evil
[1:52:51.580 --> 1:52:53.580]  You're just in a trance
[1:52:53.580 --> 1:52:55.580]  You're under mind control
[1:52:55.580 --> 1:52:57.580]  You've got to now get like the grandmaster
[1:52:57.580 --> 1:52:59.580]  Just like Ziggy Marley said
[1:52:59.580 --> 1:53:01.580]  And you've got to go, oh that's the grandmasters
[1:53:01.580 --> 1:53:03.580]  Controlling me this way
[1:53:03.580 --> 1:53:05.580]  I'm going to be a grandmaster
[1:53:05.580 --> 1:53:07.580]  But not to serve Lucifer or Satan
[1:53:07.580 --> 1:53:09.580]  I'm going to learn what they did to me
[1:53:09.580 --> 1:53:11.580]  So I can go out and teach others to show them
[1:53:11.580 --> 1:53:13.580]  God is the only way
[1:53:15.580 --> 1:53:17.580]  The Holy Spirit, the Lion of Judah
[1:53:17.580 --> 1:53:19.580]  Is for everybody
[1:53:19.580 --> 1:53:21.580]  And the system is scared of
[1:53:21.580 --> 1:53:23.580]  Any group organization
[1:53:23.580 --> 1:53:25.580]  Realizing they have that connection
[1:53:25.580 --> 1:53:27.580]  So I don't get mad at groups saying
[1:53:27.580 --> 1:53:29.580]  Oh, we're the ones, we're the best
[1:53:29.580 --> 1:53:31.580]  We're standing up, we've got God
[1:53:31.580 --> 1:53:33.580]  Because at a level when people first wake up
[1:53:33.580 --> 1:53:35.580]  That's how you see it is racial identity
[1:53:35.580 --> 1:53:37.580]  But we are a human race
[1:53:37.580 --> 1:53:39.580]  So it's bigger than that
[1:53:39.580 --> 1:53:41.580]  But you first have to recognize who you are
[1:53:41.580 --> 1:53:43.580]  And be proud of who you are in your connection to God
[1:53:43.580 --> 1:53:45.580]  And then move to the next level
[1:53:45.580 --> 1:53:47.580]  Which is we are all one together
[1:53:47.580 --> 1:53:49.580]  In this great mission that God's created
[1:53:49.580 --> 1:53:51.580]  And it's a symphony that God's creating
[1:53:51.580 --> 1:53:53.580]  All right, I said I'd get to this
[1:53:53.580 --> 1:53:55.580]  And here it is
[1:53:55.580 --> 1:53:57.580]  CDC data, fentanyl overdose
[1:53:57.580 --> 1:53:59.580]  Now kill more Americans
[1:53:59.580 --> 1:54:01.580]  18 to 45 than cancer
[1:54:03.580 --> 1:54:05.580]  Car accidents and suicide together
[1:54:05.580 --> 1:54:07.580]  Including COVID
[1:54:07.580 --> 1:54:09.580]  And it's all deaths
[1:54:11.580 --> 1:54:13.580]  As well, we just count the COVID
[1:54:15.580 --> 1:54:17.580]  So fentanyl overdoses
[1:54:17.580 --> 1:54:19.580]  For Americans aged 18 to 45
[1:54:19.580 --> 1:54:21.580]  Not just COVID, but cancer
[1:54:21.580 --> 1:54:23.580]  Car accidents and suicide on top of it
[1:54:23.580 --> 1:54:25.580]  Number one cause of unnatural death
[1:54:25.580 --> 1:54:27.580]  And do you hear a damn word
[1:54:27.580 --> 1:54:29.580]  Out of the corporate media
[1:54:29.580 --> 1:54:31.580]  This indicts them
[1:54:31.580 --> 1:54:33.580]  This convicts them
[1:54:33.580 --> 1:54:35.580]  This proves every single
[1:54:35.580 --> 1:54:37.580]  Bit of it right now
[1:54:39.580 --> 1:54:41.580]  It's a Kellerman Green article
[1:54:41.580 --> 1:54:43.580]  It deserves
[1:54:43.580 --> 1:54:45.580]  If you want to save lives to get out to people
[1:54:45.580 --> 1:54:47.580]  In this video, I just did a lot
[1:54:47.580 --> 1:54:49.580]  But I'm going to do a whole report
[1:54:49.580 --> 1:54:51.580]  On this cause this proves
[1:54:51.580 --> 1:54:53.580]  COVID's a power grab
[1:54:53.580 --> 1:54:55.580]  This proves it's about vaccine passports
[1:54:55.580 --> 1:54:57.580]  And social credit scores
[1:54:57.580 --> 1:54:59.580]  We already know that, they've admitted it
[1:54:59.580 --> 1:55:01.580]  But here it is, they don't give a damn about fentanyl
[1:55:01.580 --> 1:55:03.580]  They don't give a rat's ass about something
[1:55:03.580 --> 1:55:05.580]  That kills millions of people of every
[1:55:05.580 --> 1:55:07.580]  Stinking color
[1:55:07.580 --> 1:55:09.580]  I say stinking colors
[1:55:09.580 --> 1:55:11.580]  I'm not blaspheming what color we are
[1:55:11.580 --> 1:55:13.580]  But the fact that we're obsessed over it
[1:55:13.580 --> 1:55:15.580]  It's mind control
[1:55:15.580 --> 1:55:17.580]  Corruption of your thoughts
[1:55:17.580 --> 1:55:19.580]  Destruction of your soul
[1:55:21.580 --> 1:55:23.580]  Corrupt the thoughts, get the fake input
[1:55:23.580 --> 1:55:25.580]  In to manipulate the spirit
[1:55:25.580 --> 1:55:27.580]  First they capture
[1:55:27.580 --> 1:55:29.580]  The mind
[1:55:29.580 --> 1:55:31.580]  Then they come for the spirit
[1:55:35.580 --> 1:55:37.580]  And again
[1:55:37.580 --> 1:55:39.580]  New York City puts out an alert to parents
[1:55:39.580 --> 1:55:41.580]  Prepare for heart attacks
[1:55:41.580 --> 1:55:43.580]  You can't make this up
[1:55:45.580 --> 1:55:47.580]  Economist warrants Fed bringing a
[1:55:47.580 --> 1:55:49.580]  Peace shooter to a gunfight over inflation
[1:55:49.580 --> 1:55:51.580]  Shift gold, very important article
[1:55:51.580 --> 1:55:53.580]  On infowars.com
[1:55:53.580 --> 1:55:55.580]  And that ties into Turkey, halts all
[1:55:55.580 --> 1:55:57.580]  Trading, this is happening all over the world
[1:55:57.580 --> 1:55:59.580]  By the way, that's Turkey
[1:55:59.580 --> 1:56:01.580]  China's collapsing
[1:56:01.580 --> 1:56:03.580]  Turkey halts all stock trading
[1:56:03.580 --> 1:56:05.580]  It's currency disintegrates
[1:56:05.580 --> 1:56:07.580]  Central Bank powerless to halt collapse
[1:56:07.580 --> 1:56:09.580]  Millions of American households face
[1:56:09.580 --> 1:56:11.580]  3,500 additional expenses
[1:56:11.580 --> 1:56:13.580]  This year's inflation
[1:56:13.580 --> 1:56:15.580]  Explodes
[1:56:15.580 --> 1:56:17.580]  But that's okay
[1:56:17.580 --> 1:56:19.580]  Because the metaverse is a groping problem
[1:56:19.580 --> 1:56:21.580]  That'd be like if we were playing Donkey Kong
[1:56:21.580 --> 1:56:23.580]  And you know, you bumped into one of the barrels
[1:56:23.580 --> 1:56:25.580]  And you go, I just got, I just got groped
[1:56:25.580 --> 1:56:27.580]  But see, oh
[1:56:27.580 --> 1:56:29.580]  The simulation's what matters
[1:56:29.580 --> 1:56:31.580]  Not the real world
[1:56:31.580 --> 1:56:33.580]  They want to distract you with the simulation
[1:56:33.580 --> 1:56:35.580]  While they destroy the real world
[1:56:35.580 --> 1:56:37.580]  Their dimension's only the launch point
[1:56:37.580 --> 1:56:39.580]  To the higher level
[1:56:39.580 --> 1:56:41.580]  And they don't want you to figure that out
[1:56:41.580 --> 1:56:43.580]  They don't want you to get off the launch pad
[1:56:43.580 --> 1:56:45.580]  Ladies and gentlemen, well Reset Wars is about
[1:56:45.580 --> 1:56:47.580]  Getting off the launch pad
[1:56:47.580 --> 1:56:49.580]  And due to listener demand
[1:56:49.580 --> 1:56:51.580]  People love the course, but folks that
[1:56:51.580 --> 1:56:53.580]  Went and saw, they said, we want 25% off
[1:56:53.580 --> 1:56:55.580]  We don't want that just in three days
[1:56:55.580 --> 1:56:57.580]  So it's extended
[1:56:57.580 --> 1:56:59.580]  Through Christmas to Christmas Day
[1:56:59.580 --> 1:57:01.580]  And that's got it in because other folks
[1:57:01.580 --> 1:57:03.580]  Produced it and put it out and I convinced them
[1:57:03.580 --> 1:57:05.580]  They agreed, they brought the sale back
[1:57:05.580 --> 1:57:07.580]  25% off ResetWars.com
[1:57:07.580 --> 1:57:09.580]  And your funding keeps the show in the air
[1:57:09.580 --> 1:57:11.580]  And lets us expand
[1:57:11.580 --> 1:57:13.580]  So many things, so thank you
[1:57:13.580 --> 1:57:15.580]  To all of you that supported us and thank you for going
[1:57:15.580 --> 1:57:17.580]  And getting the course and thank you for everything else
[1:57:17.580 --> 1:57:19.580]  You've done because without you it wouldn't be here
[1:57:19.580 --> 1:57:21.580]  And we're changing the world together and never forget
[1:57:21.580 --> 1:57:23.580]  By your support of this broadcast you have accomplished
[1:57:23.580 --> 1:57:25.580]  So much for myself, my family and the crew
[1:57:25.580 --> 1:57:27.580]  Thank you so much and God bless you
[1:57:27.580 --> 1:57:29.580]  We're fighting as hard as we can
[1:57:29.580 --> 1:57:31.580]  Without your support we'll be shut down
[1:57:31.580 --> 1:57:33.580]  With your support we'll continue to fight on
[1:57:33.580 --> 1:57:35.580]  And make history together
[1:57:35.580 --> 1:57:37.580]  Alright, we're going to go to break, come back
[1:57:37.580 --> 1:57:39.580]  With my good buddy who's going to be laying out
[1:57:39.580 --> 1:57:41.580]  His ideas of logic and how to break the matrix as well
[1:57:41.580 --> 1:57:43.580]  Stay with us
[1:57:43.580 --> 1:57:45.580]  So this could be
[1:57:45.580 --> 1:57:47.580]  So this could be
[1:57:47.580 --> 1:57:49.580]  Literally your last chance
[1:57:49.580 --> 1:57:51.580]  With all the insane things

[1:59:01.580 --> 1:59:03.580]  The same ingredients, we've boosted it

[2:00:15.580 --> 2:00:17.580]  The public wordiness is being suppressed
[2:00:17.580 --> 2:00:19.580]  By the legacy media
[2:00:19.580 --> 2:00:21.580]  Federal health officials say
[2:00:21.580 --> 2:00:23.580]  Neither ivermectin nor hydroxychloroquine
[2:00:23.580 --> 2:00:25.580]  Are effective treatments for COVID
[2:00:25.580 --> 2:00:27.580]  Don't even call them mainstream
[2:00:27.580 --> 2:00:29.580]  Because they're all going to collapse
[2:00:29.580 --> 2:00:31.580]  Like all the corrupt institutions are going to collapse
[2:00:31.580 --> 2:00:33.580]  When this great light comes out
[2:00:33.580 --> 2:00:35.580]  They're serious vitriolic anger in the air
[2:00:35.580 --> 2:00:37.580]  And it's going to manifest
[2:00:37.580 --> 2:00:39.580]  And it's not going to be good for any citizens
[2:00:39.580 --> 2:00:41.580]  This is not a lunatic fringe
[2:00:41.580 --> 2:00:43.580]  This is people who are very well, very well researched
[2:00:43.580 --> 2:00:45.580]  And have plans over the course of the decade
[2:00:45.580 --> 2:00:47.580]  To completely abonish
[2:00:47.580 --> 2:00:49.580]  Every single element in the concept of freedom
[2:00:49.580 --> 2:00:51.580]  Screw your freedom
[2:00:51.580 --> 2:00:53.580]  It's the freedom of your own body
[2:00:53.580 --> 2:00:55.580]  Freedom of bodily autonomy, the freedom of travel
[2:00:55.580 --> 2:00:57.580]  If you have travel plans
[2:00:57.580 --> 2:00:59.580]  There is one more thing to add to your packing list
[2:00:59.580 --> 2:01:01.580]  Proof of vaccination
[2:01:01.580 --> 2:01:03.580]  The freedom of association
[2:01:03.580 --> 2:01:05.580]  The freedom of human expression
[2:01:05.580 --> 2:01:07.580]  They want to incorporate people into a transhumanist movement
[2:01:07.580 --> 2:01:09.580]  And whilst that seems very far-fetched
[2:01:09.580 --> 2:01:11.580]  For a lot of people
[2:01:11.580 --> 2:01:13.580]  What they have in plain sight
[2:01:13.580 --> 2:01:15.580]  Go look at UN Agenda 21
[2:01:15.580 --> 2:01:17.580]  Look at UN Agenda 30
[2:01:17.580 --> 2:01:19.580]  Look at the WEF
[2:01:19.580 --> 2:01:21.580]  It's all there in plain sight
[2:01:21.580 --> 2:01:23.580]  For the average Joe soap to find out this information
[2:01:23.580 --> 2:01:25.580]  They call it the Great Reset
[2:01:25.580 --> 2:01:27.580]  This is their global domination
[2:01:27.580 --> 2:01:29.580]  This is it, this is modern war
[2:01:29.580 --> 2:01:31.580]  How it's going to manifest, I do not know
[2:01:31.580 --> 2:01:33.580]  But I do suspect that the human spirit is going to rise up
[2:01:33.580 --> 2:01:35.580]  Against this tyranny over the course of the next number of years
[2:01:35.580 --> 2:01:37.580]  When this sh** hits the fan
[2:01:37.580 --> 2:01:39.580]  When people realize what's actually been done
[2:01:39.580 --> 2:01:41.580]  Over the thousands of people protest the latest
[2:01:41.580 --> 2:01:43.580]  Round of COVID-19 restrictions
[2:01:43.580 --> 2:01:45.580]  For everyone's children
[2:01:45.580 --> 2:01:47.580]  They guard children, especially unit children
[2:01:47.580 --> 2:01:49.580]  Because future generations will have absolutely nothing
[2:01:49.580 --> 2:01:51.580]  They will not have ownership over their own bodies
[2:01:51.580 --> 2:01:53.580]  The only way to control it is to mandate vaccination
[2:01:53.580 --> 2:01:55.580]  They will not have ownership over their own future
[2:01:55.580 --> 2:01:57.580]  They can only dream of owning a property
[2:01:57.580 --> 2:01:59.580]  The WEF was the number one plan
[2:01:59.580 --> 2:02:01.580]  Until 2030 is you will own nothing
[2:02:01.580 --> 2:02:03.580]  And you will be happy, that's pure communism lads
[2:02:03.580 --> 2:02:05.580]  If people don't own any resources
[2:02:05.580 --> 2:02:07.580]  Who does own it?
[2:02:07.580 --> 2:02:09.580]  Who is holding these bastards accountable?
[2:02:09.580 --> 2:02:11.580]  Who the f**k is holding these bastards accountable?
[2:02:11.580 --> 2:02:13.580]  I tell you who's going to hold it, the people of Ireland will
[2:02:13.580 --> 2:02:15.580]  And when the people of Ireland wake up
[2:02:15.580 --> 2:02:17.580]  Why god, there's going to be health pay
[2:02:17.580 --> 2:02:19.580]  Powerful video at Band-Aid Video
[2:02:19.580 --> 2:02:21.580]  Get it and share it
[2:02:21.580 --> 2:02:23.580]  Ireland Rodgers is coming to the New World Order
[2:02:23.580 --> 2:02:25.580]  Band-Aid Video, get it, share it now
[2:02:25.580 --> 2:02:27.580]  In the midst of the worst health crisis
[2:02:27.580 --> 2:02:29.580]  We're facing
[2:02:29.580 --> 2:02:31.580]  In more than a century
[2:02:31.580 --> 2:02:33.580]  Don't tell your supporters, don't be afraid
[2:02:33.580 --> 2:02:35.580]  Of COVID
[2:02:35.580 --> 2:02:37.580]  Don't be afraid of COVID
[2:02:37.580 --> 2:02:39.580]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID
[2:02:49.580 --> 2:02:51.580]  Don't tell your supporters
[2:02:51.580 --> 2:02:53.580]  Don't be afraid of COVID
[2:02:53.580 --> 2:02:55.580]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID
[2:02:57.580 --> 2:02:59.580]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID
[2:02:59.580 --> 2:03:01.580]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID
[2:03:01.580 --> 2:03:03.580]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID
[2:03:03.580 --> 2:03:05.580]  I just will say, they gave me a regenerant
[2:03:05.580 --> 2:03:07.580]  We have hundreds of thousands of doses
[2:03:07.580 --> 2:03:09.580]  That are just about ready
[2:03:09.580 --> 2:03:11.580]  And if you're in the hospital
[2:03:11.580 --> 2:03:13.580]  And you're feeling really bad
[2:03:13.580 --> 2:03:15.580]  We're going to work it so that you get them
[2:03:15.580 --> 2:03:17.580]  And you're going to get them free
[2:03:17.580 --> 2:03:19.580]  And especially if you're a senior
[2:03:19.580 --> 2:03:21.580]  We're going to get them free
[2:03:21.580 --> 2:03:23.580]  And especially if you're a senior
[2:03:23.580 --> 2:03:25.580]  We're going to get them free
[2:03:25.580 --> 2:03:27.580]  And especially if you're a senior
[2:03:27.580 --> 2:03:29.580]  We're going to get them free
[2:03:29.580 --> 2:03:31.580]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID
[2:03:31.580 --> 2:03:33.580]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID
[2:03:33.580 --> 2:03:35.580]  Everyone should be afraid of COVID
[2:03:41.580 --> 2:03:43.580]  Is there no one who can tell them
[2:03:43.580 --> 2:03:45.580]  Don't do this?
[2:03:47.580 --> 2:03:49.580]  The year is 2020
[2:03:49.580 --> 2:03:51.580]  Following several decades
[2:03:51.580 --> 2:03:53.580]  Of systematically weakening the social
[2:03:53.580 --> 2:03:55.580]  Model and financial resilience
[2:03:55.580 --> 2:03:57.580]  Of the American people
[2:03:57.580 --> 2:03:59.580]  The global cabal has launched
[2:03:59.580 --> 2:04:01.580]  A series of unimaginable terrors
[2:04:01.580 --> 2:04:03.580]  That have rocked the foundation of western civilization
[2:04:03.580 --> 2:04:05.580]  And has fractured the population
[2:04:05.580 --> 2:04:07.580]  Of a once united country
[2:04:07.580 --> 2:04:09.580]  Along increasingly irreconcilable lines
[2:04:09.580 --> 2:04:11.580]  The nation finds herself
[2:04:11.580 --> 2:04:13.580]  On the precipice of all out civil war
[2:04:13.580 --> 2:04:15.580]  Diving headlong towards economic ruin
[2:04:15.580 --> 2:04:17.580]  And already suffocating
[2:04:17.580 --> 2:04:19.580]  Under the dictatorship of biotechnocratic
[2:04:19.580 --> 2:04:21.580]  Inslave
[2:04:21.580 --> 2:04:23.580]  The final takedown order has been issued
[2:04:23.580 --> 2:04:25.580]  The direct attack has begun
[2:04:25.580 --> 2:04:27.580]  America's greatest trial
[2:04:27.580 --> 2:04:29.580]  In the battle for her survival
[2:04:29.580 --> 2:04:31.580]  Is underway
[2:04:31.580 --> 2:04:33.580]  Info wars emergency transmissions
[2:04:33.580 --> 2:04:35.580]  Are now broadcasting live

[2:04:45.580 --> 2:04:47.580]  You are the resistance
[2:04:47.580 --> 2:04:49.580]  Alright folks start your engines
[2:04:49.580 --> 2:04:51.580]  We're 326 days out from the midterms
[2:04:51.580 --> 2:04:53.580]  We'll be right back with Mike Reardon
[2:04:53.580 --> 2:05:22.580]  Stay with us.
[2:05:23.580 --> 2:05:25.580]  It is the true digital economy
[2:05:25.580 --> 2:05:27.580]  It's the spiritual economy
[2:05:27.580 --> 2:05:29.580]  Of the mind
[2:05:29.580 --> 2:05:31.580]  And transcendent control
[2:05:31.580 --> 2:05:33.580]  I've been on there 28 years
[2:05:33.580 --> 2:05:35.580]  And all of our work has been
[2:05:35.580 --> 2:05:37.580]  Amazing thanks to God
[2:05:37.580 --> 2:05:39.580]  And God's divine
[2:05:39.580 --> 2:05:41.580]  Empowerment and blessing
[2:05:41.580 --> 2:05:43.580]  But I gotta tell you out of everything I've done
[2:05:43.580 --> 2:05:45.580]  Reset wars is the most important
[2:05:45.580 --> 2:05:47.580]  And it is now available
[2:05:47.580 --> 2:05:49.580]  Now at the month of December 2021

[2:05:57.580 --> 2:05:59.580]  This information
[2:05:59.580 --> 2:06:01.580]  It's the third hour
[2:06:01.580 --> 2:06:03.580]  Of the live December 17th
[2:06:03.580 --> 2:06:05.580]  Friday transmission
[2:06:05.580 --> 2:06:07.580]  Of the Alachone show
[2:06:07.580 --> 2:06:09.580]  That means my good friend Michael Reardon
[2:06:09.580 --> 2:06:11.580]  Is here with us
[2:06:11.580 --> 2:06:13.580]  That I twisted his arm
[2:06:13.580 --> 2:06:15.580]  To get on air
[2:06:15.580 --> 2:06:17.580]  We have great discussions
[2:06:17.580 --> 2:06:19.580]  Good friend of mine
[2:06:19.580 --> 2:06:21.580]  And he always just has really great ways
[2:06:21.580 --> 2:06:23.580]  To boil down knowledge
[2:06:23.580 --> 2:06:25.580]  Michael Reardon
[2:06:25.580 --> 2:06:27.580]  Was born in Connecticut
[2:06:27.580 --> 2:06:29.580]  But now lives in the good state of Texas
[2:06:29.580 --> 2:06:31.580]  He graduated master's degree in education
[2:06:31.580 --> 2:06:33.580]  In 2013 he taught in public school system
[2:06:33.580 --> 2:06:35.580]  Teaching kindergarten to 12th grade
[2:06:35.580 --> 2:06:37.580]  During his years of teaching
[2:06:37.580 --> 2:06:39.580]  He saw the need to fill in the cracks
[2:06:39.580 --> 2:06:41.580]  Of education and help people know the truth
[2:06:41.580 --> 2:06:43.580]  About life
[2:06:43.580 --> 2:06:45.580]  Michael founded his company
[2:06:45.580 --> 2:06:47.580]  Raven Concepts in 2018
[2:06:47.580 --> 2:06:49.580]  He founded his company
[2:06:49.580 --> 2:06:51.580]  Due for the need for more vital
[2:06:51.580 --> 2:06:53.580]  Mindsets to be created
[2:06:53.580 --> 2:06:55.580]  Not I guess failure mindsets
[2:06:55.580 --> 2:06:57.580]  Michael saw the mindsets
[2:06:57.580 --> 2:06:59.580]  That parents, the school system
[2:06:59.580 --> 2:07:01.580]  The government, the mainstream media were formulating
[2:07:01.580 --> 2:07:03.580]  And saw a significant flaw in the structure
[2:07:03.580 --> 2:07:05.580]  That's putting it lightly
[2:07:05.580 --> 2:07:07.580]  That flaw was that people lost the ability
[2:07:07.580 --> 2:07:09.580]  To understand their own self worth
[2:07:09.580 --> 2:07:11.580]  His mission is to help give people
[2:07:11.580 --> 2:07:13.580]  The courage and the mindset to go after
[2:07:13.580 --> 2:07:15.580]  What they want in life and dream of having
[2:07:15.580 --> 2:07:17.580]  He helps people recognize their value
[2:07:17.580 --> 2:07:19.580]  And their potential within them
[2:07:19.580 --> 2:07:21.580]  With all of this going on in the world
[2:07:21.580 --> 2:07:23.580]  Our number one greatest weapon
[2:07:23.580 --> 2:07:25.580]  And tool to fight back against
[2:07:25.580 --> 2:07:27.580]  This restructuring is to develop
[2:07:27.580 --> 2:07:29.580]  A stronger mindset
[2:07:29.580 --> 2:07:31.580]  I totally agree, we've got to develop
[2:07:31.580 --> 2:07:33.580]  A stronger mindset and know that we're under attack
[2:07:33.580 --> 2:07:35.580]  And not be victims but admit it
[2:07:35.580 --> 2:07:37.580]  RavenConcepts.com
[2:07:37.580 --> 2:07:39.580]  RavenConcepts.com
[2:07:39.580 --> 2:07:41.580]  I don't know if they typoed that
[2:07:41.580 --> 2:07:43.580]  But it's good to have you here
[2:07:43.580 --> 2:07:45.580]  Mike, thanks for coming on the show
[2:07:45.580 --> 2:07:47.580]  I've always enjoyed talking to you
[2:07:47.580 --> 2:07:49.580]  You wanted to start with the mass psychosis
[2:07:49.580 --> 2:07:51.580]  That's going on
[2:07:51.580 --> 2:07:53.580]  And how you've witnessed that in the education system
[2:07:53.580 --> 2:07:55.580]  And how to break out of it
[2:07:55.580 --> 2:07:57.580]  When I was an educator
[2:07:57.580 --> 2:07:59.580]  It's interesting
[2:07:59.580 --> 2:08:01.580]  Because you have to
[2:08:01.580 --> 2:08:03.580]  Deal with it in the sense of
[2:08:03.580 --> 2:08:05.580]  What is going to be the next steps
[2:08:05.580 --> 2:08:07.580]  Because you just don't teach a first grader
[2:08:07.580 --> 2:08:09.580]  How to do calculus
[2:08:09.580 --> 2:08:11.580]  They learn addition and subtraction
[2:08:11.580 --> 2:08:13.580]  And it's a series of steps
[2:08:13.580 --> 2:08:15.580]  So for people
[2:08:15.580 --> 2:08:17.580]  I started to wonder
[2:08:17.580 --> 2:08:19.580]  Now we're in an age of COVID
[2:08:19.580 --> 2:08:21.580]  And basically everyone's
[2:08:21.580 --> 2:08:23.580]  Going to be influenced by mainstream media
[2:08:23.580 --> 2:08:25.580]  How did that happen? It didn't just
[2:08:25.580 --> 2:08:27.580]  Happen overnight
[2:08:27.580 --> 2:08:29.580]  So I started to look at it from
[2:08:29.580 --> 2:08:31.580]  The premise of
[2:08:31.580 --> 2:08:33.580]  The school
[2:08:33.580 --> 2:08:35.580]  What is happening in the school system
[2:08:35.580 --> 2:08:37.580]  So I know Dr.
[2:08:37.580 --> 2:08:39.580]  McCalla, I believe
[2:08:39.580 --> 2:08:41.580]  Dr. McCalla Rogan
[2:08:41.580 --> 2:08:43.580]  And he was talking about mass psychosis
[2:08:43.580 --> 2:08:45.580]  And he talked about how there needs to be
[2:08:45.580 --> 2:08:47.580]  Four steps in order for that mass psychosis
[2:08:47.580 --> 2:08:49.580]  In order
[2:08:49.580 --> 2:08:51.580]  To occur
[2:08:51.580 --> 2:08:53.580]  And in the school system, if we think about it
[2:08:53.580 --> 2:08:55.580]  The first step is already there
[2:08:55.580 --> 2:08:57.580]  Isolation
[2:08:57.580 --> 2:08:59.580]  We put you in a desk
[2:08:59.580 --> 2:09:01.580]  We give you a cubby, we give you a spot
[2:09:01.580 --> 2:09:03.580]  And we say this is where you need to be
[2:09:03.580 --> 2:09:05.580]  And you don't deviate from that
[2:09:05.580 --> 2:09:07.580]  So now you're stuck
[2:09:07.580 --> 2:09:09.580]  And you're not
[2:09:09.580 --> 2:09:11.580]  Encouraged to
[2:09:11.580 --> 2:09:13.580]  Ask your peers, ask your classmates
[2:09:13.580 --> 2:09:15.580]  For the answers, now you're by yourself
[2:09:15.580 --> 2:09:17.580]  You're on a desert island and you're isolated
[2:09:17.580 --> 2:09:19.580]  So when
[2:09:19.580 --> 2:09:21.580]  COVID started to happen
[2:09:21.580 --> 2:09:23.580]  And the quarantine started to happen
[2:09:23.580 --> 2:09:25.580]  Why was it so easy for people to say
[2:09:25.580 --> 2:09:27.580]  Well, I guess I'll just give up my rights
[2:09:27.580 --> 2:09:29.580]  I guess I'll just give up my freedom
[2:09:29.580 --> 2:09:31.580]  And I was to stay inside
[2:09:31.580 --> 2:09:33.580]  I'm not an essential worker
[2:09:33.580 --> 2:09:35.580]  That had to happen from somewhere
[2:09:35.580 --> 2:09:37.580]  It didn't happen overnight
[2:09:37.580 --> 2:09:39.580]  So from a young age
[2:09:39.580 --> 2:09:41.580]  When a child is most susceptible
[2:09:41.580 --> 2:09:43.580]  From age 0 to 7
[2:09:43.580 --> 2:09:45.580]  That's when a child is most susceptible
[2:09:45.580 --> 2:09:47.580]  Because they're going to be
[2:09:47.580 --> 2:09:49.580]  Operating under their environment
[2:09:49.580 --> 2:09:51.580]  And their behavior
[2:09:51.580 --> 2:09:53.580]  So if their environment is telling them to do something
[2:09:53.580 --> 2:09:55.580]  Or the behavior is to enact
[2:09:55.580 --> 2:09:57.580]  Stay inside
[2:09:57.580 --> 2:09:59.580]  Don't go out
[2:09:59.580 --> 2:10:01.580]  That's going to have a psychological effect on them
[2:10:01.580 --> 2:10:03.580]  When they reach adulthood
[2:10:03.580 --> 2:10:05.580]  And typically that's going to be
[2:10:05.580 --> 2:10:07.580]  Putting them in a box
[2:10:07.580 --> 2:10:09.580]  Saying that you need to stay here
[2:10:09.580 --> 2:10:11.580]  And you need to do what we say you need to do
[2:10:11.580 --> 2:10:13.580]  And you don't talk back
[2:10:13.580 --> 2:10:15.580]  And right now we need to
[2:10:15.580 --> 2:10:17.580]  Start to change that type of behavior
[2:10:17.580 --> 2:10:19.580]  That type of structure
[2:10:19.580 --> 2:10:21.580]  They're training them to be prisoners
[2:10:21.580 --> 2:10:23.580]  And guys, you can type in, there's a bunch of studies
[2:10:23.580 --> 2:10:25.580]  Studies show cognitive levels of children
[2:10:25.580 --> 2:10:27.580]  Under lockdown plunged in the last two years
[2:10:27.580 --> 2:10:29.580]  This is serious child abuse
[2:10:29.580 --> 2:10:31.580]  And these are behavioral psychologists
[2:10:31.580 --> 2:10:33.580]  Programming, this is really abusive
[2:10:33.580 --> 2:10:35.580]  Yes, and I think there was
[2:10:35.580 --> 2:10:37.580]  A video that came out, it was on
[2:10:37.580 --> 2:10:39.580]  Twitter
[2:10:39.580 --> 2:10:41.580]  And it was about a teacher
[2:10:41.580 --> 2:10:43.580]  In California who was talking about
[2:10:43.580 --> 2:10:45.580]  I believe gender
[2:10:45.580 --> 2:10:47.580]  And they were influencing
[2:10:47.580 --> 2:10:49.580]  A student to think about a certain way
[2:10:49.580 --> 2:10:51.580]  To think gender in a certain way
[2:10:51.580 --> 2:10:53.580]  Now when you're a teacher
[2:10:53.580 --> 2:10:55.580]  You have a
[2:10:55.580 --> 2:10:57.580]  Big role to play, right?
[2:10:57.580 --> 2:10:59.580]  You have someone's child
[2:10:59.580 --> 2:11:01.580]  For at least eight hours a day
[2:11:01.580 --> 2:11:03.580]  And of course the child's going to be sleeping
[2:11:03.580 --> 2:11:05.580]  Eight hours, so that means the parent has
[2:11:05.580 --> 2:11:07.580]  The last eight hours
[2:11:07.580 --> 2:11:09.580]  And most parents don't
[2:11:09.580 --> 2:11:11.580]  Take education past the school
[2:11:11.580 --> 2:11:13.580]  Typically the parent will say
[2:11:13.580 --> 2:11:15.580]  Have you done your homework?
[2:11:15.580 --> 2:11:17.580]  Are you doing what needs to be done?
[2:11:17.580 --> 2:11:19.580]  Great, alright, see you later
[2:11:19.580 --> 2:11:21.580]  But now parents are starting to pay attention
[2:11:21.580 --> 2:11:23.580]  Especially after the whole
[2:11:23.580 --> 2:11:25.580]  Quarantine lockdowns
[2:11:25.580 --> 2:11:27.580]  And children had to learn at home
[2:11:27.580 --> 2:11:29.580]  Via Zoom or whatever
[2:11:29.580 --> 2:11:31.580]  Internet website they used
[2:11:31.580 --> 2:11:33.580]  For that type of classroom
[2:11:33.580 --> 2:11:35.580]  And now parents are seeing
[2:11:35.580 --> 2:11:37.580]  My kid is not learning in school
[2:11:37.580 --> 2:11:39.580]  And now that's when you see all these
[2:11:39.580 --> 2:11:41.580]  Parents going to these
[2:11:41.580 --> 2:11:43.580]  Board meetings
[2:11:43.580 --> 2:11:45.580]  With the
[2:11:45.580 --> 2:11:47.580]  Superintendents
[2:11:47.580 --> 2:11:49.580]  And just the whole educational system
[2:11:49.580 --> 2:11:51.580]  And they're fighting back
[2:11:51.580 --> 2:11:53.580]  They're saying this is not right
[2:11:53.580 --> 2:11:55.580]  What they're learning is not necessary
[2:11:55.580 --> 2:11:57.580]  And if we look at curriculum
[2:11:57.580 --> 2:11:59.580]  There's a basic
[2:11:59.580 --> 2:12:01.580]  Set of content that is going to be
[2:12:01.580 --> 2:12:03.580]  Learned, that children need to
[2:12:03.580 --> 2:12:05.580]  Learn, but now we're starting
[2:12:05.580 --> 2:12:07.580]  To get into what we want
[2:12:07.580 --> 2:12:09.580]  Them to learn, but who are the people
[2:12:09.580 --> 2:12:11.580]  Who are telling us that
[2:12:11.580 --> 2:12:13.580]  They need to know this type of content
[2:12:13.580 --> 2:12:15.580]  Mr. Government, if we think about it
[2:12:15.580 --> 2:12:17.580]  They're saying we want the kids to know
[2:12:17.580 --> 2:12:19.580]  This, so we can
[2:12:19.580 --> 2:12:21.580]  Stir them in a certain way, the whole
[2:12:21.580 --> 2:12:23.580]  Race
[2:12:23.580 --> 2:12:25.580]  Type of thing, right?
[2:12:25.580 --> 2:12:27.580]  So I think the
[2:12:27.580 --> 2:12:29.580]  Term they're phrasing is
[2:12:31.580 --> 2:12:33.580]  For critical race there
[2:12:33.580 --> 2:12:35.580]  Critical race there, yes, thank you, Alex
[2:12:35.580 --> 2:12:37.580]  Why is that necessary?
[2:12:37.580 --> 2:12:39.580]  And it's to keep us down
[2:12:39.580 --> 2:12:41.580]  It's to keep us in a sense of
[2:12:41.580 --> 2:12:43.580]  Oh, I'm a victim
[2:12:43.580 --> 2:12:45.580]  And as long as we keep that
[2:12:45.580 --> 2:12:47.580]  Victim mentality, we're going to have
[2:12:47.580 --> 2:12:49.580]  A difficult time moving ahead in life
[2:12:49.580 --> 2:12:51.580]  And you've got
[2:12:51.580 --> 2:12:53.580]  Great ways of explaining things
[2:12:53.580 --> 2:12:55.580]  And by the way, I'm always reading names
[2:12:55.580 --> 2:12:57.580]  Of things wrong, I go to your site all the time
[2:12:57.580 --> 2:12:59.580]  It's Reven, not Raven, but Reven
[2:12:59.580 --> 2:13:01.580]  Explain with that what Reven
[2:13:01.580 --> 2:13:03.580]  Concepts means, because I always got to
[2:13:03.580 --> 2:13:05.580]  For some reason, I always got to butcher intros
[2:13:05.580 --> 2:13:07.580]  Yes, so Reven Concepts
[2:13:07.580 --> 2:13:09.580]  And Reven Concepts means
[2:13:09.580 --> 2:13:11.580]  The concept behind never
[2:13:11.580 --> 2:13:13.580]  So if you turn Reven
[2:13:13.580 --> 2:13:15.580]  Reven around, it means never
[2:13:15.580 --> 2:13:17.580]  Oh, I get it, so I'm an idiot, I have dyslexia
[2:13:17.580 --> 2:13:19.580]  I'm seeing like Reven Concepts
[2:13:19.580 --> 2:13:21.580]  Even it's Reven, which means never
[2:13:21.580 --> 2:13:23.580]  Concepts
[2:13:23.580 --> 2:13:25.580]  And the name came from when
[2:13:25.580 --> 2:13:27.580]  I was actually a swim coach
[2:13:27.580 --> 2:13:29.580]  I was given a student
[2:13:29.580 --> 2:13:31.580]  From another coach, she was going
[2:13:31.580 --> 2:13:33.580]  To be an educator also
[2:13:33.580 --> 2:13:35.580]  So she was going to the program
[2:13:35.580 --> 2:13:37.580]  To become a school teacher
[2:13:37.580 --> 2:13:39.580]  She's going to be teaching people's children
[2:13:39.580 --> 2:13:41.580]  And she gave me one of her students
[2:13:41.580 --> 2:13:43.580]  Because she was booked and I said not a problem
[2:13:43.580 --> 2:13:45.580]  So the child had a fear of water
[2:13:45.580 --> 2:13:47.580]  And he didn't want to go into the deep end
[2:13:47.580 --> 2:13:49.580]  So I had 30 minutes with the child
[2:13:49.580 --> 2:13:51.580]  To get him to swim in the deep end
[2:13:51.580 --> 2:13:53.580]  And
[2:13:53.580 --> 2:13:55.580]  What I had to overcome
[2:13:55.580 --> 2:13:57.580]  Was her teaching and then his beliefs
[2:13:57.580 --> 2:13:59.580]  And his belief was that he couldn't do it
[2:13:59.580 --> 2:14:01.580]  And she even told me
[2:14:01.580 --> 2:14:03.580]  Before I brought him into the deep end
[2:14:03.580 --> 2:14:05.580]  Don't even try, it's not worth it
[2:14:05.580 --> 2:14:07.580]  And this is a person who was going
[2:14:07.580 --> 2:14:09.580]  To school to be an educator
[2:14:09.580 --> 2:14:11.580]  And I can't tell you how many times
[2:14:11.580 --> 2:14:13.580]  Educators have put
[2:14:13.580 --> 2:14:15.580]  Students in a box saying
[2:14:15.580 --> 2:14:17.580]  You're not going to be anything
[2:14:17.580 --> 2:14:19.580]  Wow, and that's what you told me
[2:14:19.580 --> 2:14:21.580]  Like a year ago when we were talking is
[2:14:21.580 --> 2:14:23.580]  They literally don't even know they've been trained
[2:14:23.580 --> 2:14:25.580]  By the education system to program
[2:14:25.580 --> 2:14:27.580]  And put walls in people's minds to build prisons
[2:14:27.580 --> 2:14:29.580]  And now it's so obvious that we're non-essential
[2:14:29.580 --> 2:14:31.580]  And they're trying to have adults stay in a prison
[2:14:31.580 --> 2:14:33.580]  Exactly, and then
[2:14:33.580 --> 2:14:35.580]  When we look at the essential workers
[2:14:35.580 --> 2:14:37.580]  Right, the healthcare workers
[2:14:37.580 --> 2:14:39.580]  And then all of a sudden they hit you with a mandate
[2:14:39.580 --> 2:14:41.580]  And if you don't get the vaccine, guess what
[2:14:41.580 --> 2:14:43.580]  You are no longer essential
[2:14:43.580 --> 2:14:45.580]  They give you a term to make you feel good
[2:14:45.580 --> 2:14:47.580]  And they can take it away when they want to
[2:14:47.580 --> 2:14:49.580]  And it's going to be similar
[2:14:49.580 --> 2:14:51.580]  To how companies will give you a promotion
[2:14:51.580 --> 2:14:53.580]  But the promotion is only a name change
[2:14:53.580 --> 2:14:55.580]  It's not necessarily an increase
[2:14:55.580 --> 2:14:57.580]  In monetary amount, it's saying
[2:14:57.580 --> 2:14:59.580]  Well, we're going to make you the director
[2:14:59.580 --> 2:15:01.580]  Of science and history
[2:15:01.580 --> 2:15:03.580]  And you say, wow, that's great
[2:15:03.580 --> 2:15:05.580]  And you put it on your LinkedIn page
[2:15:05.580 --> 2:15:07.580]  And you say this and everyone congratulates you
[2:15:07.580 --> 2:15:09.580]  And you feel good, but you necessarily
[2:15:09.580 --> 2:15:11.580]  Didn't go anywhere
[2:15:11.580 --> 2:15:13.580]  People are not going anywhere in life
[2:15:13.580 --> 2:15:15.580]  They're giving a facade
[2:15:15.580 --> 2:15:17.580]  A false sense of movement
[2:15:17.580 --> 2:15:19.580]  And people will go through life
[2:15:19.580 --> 2:15:21.580]  Thinking they're making progress
[2:15:21.580 --> 2:15:23.580]  But they're only going backwards
[2:15:23.580 --> 2:15:25.580]  Beautifully said, and again
[2:15:25.580 --> 2:15:27.580]  People need to go to RevinConcepts
[2:15:27.580 --> 2:15:29.580]  R-E-V-E-N Concepts.com
[2:15:29.580 --> 2:15:31.580]  And I should have asked you what that name means
[2:15:31.580 --> 2:15:33.580]  That is really amazing
[2:15:33.580 --> 2:15:35.580]  It's never reversed
[2:15:35.580 --> 2:15:37.580]  Instead of never, you're saying, no, we're doing it
[2:15:37.580 --> 2:15:39.580]  Correct
[2:15:39.580 --> 2:15:41.580]  You're smart. I need you to help me
[2:15:41.580 --> 2:15:43.580]  With the new names
[2:15:43.580 --> 2:15:45.580]  Michael Reardon is being really nice
[2:15:45.580 --> 2:15:47.580]  Right now and really calm
[2:15:47.580 --> 2:15:49.580]  He's being very, very, very, very gentlemanly
[2:15:49.580 --> 2:15:51.580]  But we're going to turn him loose here
[2:15:51.580 --> 2:15:53.580]  On the other side
[2:15:53.580 --> 2:16:21.580]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[2:16:23.580 --> 2:16:25.580]  We'll be right back.
[2:16:53.580 --> 2:16:55.580]  We've all heard about the pastor
[2:16:55.580 --> 2:16:57.580]  In his famous statement
[2:16:57.580 --> 2:16:59.580]  From inside a concentration camp
[2:16:59.580 --> 2:17:01.580]  In World War II that
[2:17:01.580 --> 2:17:03.580]  When they came for one group
[2:17:03.580 --> 2:17:05.580]  He wasn't part of that group
[2:17:05.580 --> 2:17:07.580]  So he didn't stand up
[2:17:07.580 --> 2:17:09.580]  And then when they came for another group
[2:17:09.580 --> 2:17:11.580]  He wasn't part of that group
[2:17:11.580 --> 2:17:13.580]  So he didn't stand up
[2:17:13.580 --> 2:17:15.580]  And finally, when they came for him
[2:17:15.580 --> 2:17:17.580]  There was nobody else to stand up
[2:17:17.580 --> 2:17:19.580]  The Global Social Credit Score
[2:17:19.580 --> 2:17:21.580]  That China is putting in
[2:17:21.580 --> 2:17:23.580]  To criticize the government
[2:17:23.580 --> 2:17:25.580]  You can never buy or sell again
[2:17:25.580 --> 2:17:27.580]  Well, that's being brought here
[2:17:27.580 --> 2:17:29.580]  And all over the world
[2:17:29.580 --> 2:17:31.580]  The guys with COVID
[2:17:31.580 --> 2:17:33.580]  Vaccine passports, they even admit it
[2:17:33.580 --> 2:17:35.580]  Now there's going to be a
[2:17:35.580 --> 2:17:37.580]  Carbon tax attached to it
[2:17:37.580 --> 2:17:39.580]  They're going to track where you go and what you do
[2:17:39.580 --> 2:17:41.580]  And decide where you can go and what you can do
[2:17:41.580 --> 2:17:43.580]  That's what the lockdowns are about
[2:17:43.580 --> 2:17:45.580]  You'll accept that, you'll accept anything
[2:17:45.580 --> 2:17:47.580]  So again, the left is having fun
[2:17:47.580 --> 2:17:49.580]  Right now with all the censorship and tyranny
[2:17:49.580 --> 2:17:51.580]  As well, we need to get back to
[2:17:51.580 --> 2:17:53.580]  Basic human rights and promote them
[2:17:53.580 --> 2:17:55.580]  Or all of us will be enslaved by this horrible
[2:17:55.580 --> 2:18:21.580]  See you around by The Globalist
[2:18:25.580 --> 2:18:41.580]  The Globalist
[2:18:41.580 --> 2:18:53.580]  The Globalist
[2:18:53.580 --> 2:18:55.580]  And so we have the best ones at
[2:18:55.580 --> 2:18:57.580]  M4warStore.com
[2:18:57.580 --> 2:18:59.580]  U.N. Run contact tracers aren't coming
[2:18:59.580 --> 2:19:01.580]  They're here all over the world
[2:19:01.580 --> 2:19:03.580]  From Australia to the United States
[2:19:03.580 --> 2:19:05.580]  From Canada to Germany
[2:19:05.580 --> 2:19:07.580]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do
[2:19:07.580 --> 2:19:09.580]  Everywhere you go
[2:19:09.580 --> 2:19:11.580]  And threatening in some cases
[2:19:11.580 --> 2:19:13.580]  Taking people away into the night
[2:19:13.580 --> 2:19:15.580]  To their facilities
[2:19:15.580 --> 2:19:17.580]  And they're planning in the next year
[2:19:17.580 --> 2:19:19.580]  To expand their shield process
[2:19:19.580 --> 2:19:21.580]  Where they come and take healthy
[2:19:21.580 --> 2:19:23.580]  People away and put them in facilities
[2:19:23.580 --> 2:19:25.580]  For their safety
[2:19:25.580 --> 2:19:27.580]  This is nothing less than martial law
[2:19:27.580 --> 2:19:29.580]  And one big thing you can do to fight back
[2:19:29.580 --> 2:19:31.580]  Is to get high quality Faraday cages
[2:19:31.580 --> 2:19:33.580]  Many of which are made here in America
[2:19:33.580 --> 2:19:35.580]  And are very compliant
[2:19:35.580 --> 2:19:37.580]  Meaning U.S. government military grade
[2:19:37.580 --> 2:19:39.580]  At M4warStore.com
[2:19:39.580 --> 2:19:41.580]  We have the entire line of silent pocket
[2:19:41.580 --> 2:19:43.580]  Ready to ship to you when you visit
[2:19:43.580 --> 2:19:45.580]  M4warStore.com
[2:19:45.580 --> 2:19:47.580]  Again, we have big backpacks
[2:19:47.580 --> 2:19:49.580]  We have special dry bags
[2:19:49.580 --> 2:19:51.580]  For iPads, it's all there
[2:19:51.580 --> 2:19:53.580]  At M4warStore.com
[2:19:53.580 --> 2:19:55.580]  So protect your privacy today
[2:19:55.580 --> 2:20:23.580]  M4warStore.com
[2:20:23.580 --> 2:20:25.580]  The points he makes when we're hanging out sometimes
[2:20:25.580 --> 2:20:27.580]  Are just dead on
[2:20:27.580 --> 2:20:29.580]  We got caught up by that break coming
[2:20:29.580 --> 2:20:31.580]  You were getting into how they
[2:20:31.580 --> 2:20:33.580]  Put walls around people's minds
[2:20:33.580 --> 2:20:35.580]  Pre-program them about who they are
[2:20:35.580 --> 2:20:37.580]  To make them controllable
[2:20:37.580 --> 2:20:39.580]  And how to break out of that
[2:20:39.580 --> 2:20:41.580]  So please continue
[2:20:41.580 --> 2:20:43.580]  Once you are in that box
[2:20:43.580 --> 2:20:45.580]  They can keep you there as long as they want
[2:20:45.580 --> 2:20:47.580]  And the only way to get out
[2:20:47.580 --> 2:20:49.580]  Is to understand that there's going to be
[2:20:49.580 --> 2:20:51.580]  Something better on the other side
[2:20:51.580 --> 2:20:53.580]  So people have motivation
[2:20:53.580 --> 2:20:55.580]  To break out of their box
[2:20:55.580 --> 2:20:57.580]  Because the human mind is naturally negative
[2:20:57.580 --> 2:20:59.580]  The human mind wants to be comfortable
[2:20:59.580 --> 2:21:01.580]  The human mind is naturally lazy
[2:21:01.580 --> 2:21:03.580]  So that means
[2:21:03.580 --> 2:21:05.580]  If you have the opportunity
[2:21:05.580 --> 2:21:07.580]  To stay home, watch Netflix, stay on your phone
[2:21:07.580 --> 2:21:09.580]  Your mind is going to say that's a pretty good idea
[2:21:09.580 --> 2:21:11.580]  So when, for example
[2:21:11.580 --> 2:21:13.580]  The lockdowns came down
[2:21:13.580 --> 2:21:15.580]  And the whole quarantine, your brain was like
[2:21:15.580 --> 2:21:17.580]  Well, short thing, not a problem
[2:21:17.580 --> 2:21:19.580]  And what happens after that
[2:21:19.580 --> 2:21:21.580]  Is now we are faced with
[2:21:21.580 --> 2:21:23.580]  How do we get out of that
[2:21:23.580 --> 2:21:25.580]  Way of thinking? How do we get out of that laziness?
[2:21:25.580 --> 2:21:27.580]  And
[2:21:27.580 --> 2:21:29.580]  That's the most difficult part
[2:21:29.580 --> 2:21:31.580]  Because once someone stops
[2:21:31.580 --> 2:21:33.580]  Something, it becomes more difficult
[2:21:33.580 --> 2:21:35.580]  To start it back up
[2:21:35.580 --> 2:21:37.580]  And let me just say this
[2:21:37.580 --> 2:21:39.580]  I had some throwing knives once you were at the office
[2:21:39.580 --> 2:21:41.580]  And I can throw six of them
[2:21:41.580 --> 2:21:43.580]  And maybe get one to stick in the wall
[2:21:43.580 --> 2:21:45.580]  Every six, you threw all six of them
[2:21:45.580 --> 2:21:47.580]  And stuck in the wall
[2:21:47.580 --> 2:21:49.580]  And you're like
[2:21:49.580 --> 2:21:51.580]  But that's just an example of
[2:21:51.580 --> 2:21:53.580]  You've decided to train yourself
[2:21:53.580 --> 2:21:55.580]  To have the will to do it
[2:21:55.580 --> 2:21:57.580]  Instead of thinking these aren't going to stick
[2:21:57.580 --> 2:21:59.580]  And then I tried the other day
[2:21:59.580 --> 2:22:01.580]  I threw it 12 feet away
[2:22:01.580 --> 2:22:03.580]  All four darts bullseye
[2:22:03.580 --> 2:22:05.580]  By just saying I'm doing it
[2:22:05.580 --> 2:22:07.580]  So when you make up your mind
[2:22:07.580 --> 2:22:09.580]  And you say you're going to do something
[2:22:09.580 --> 2:22:11.580]  The probability of you achieving it
[2:22:11.580 --> 2:22:13.580]  Is going to be greater than if you went in it
[2:22:13.580 --> 2:22:15.580]  Nonchalantly
[2:22:15.580 --> 2:22:17.580]  You have your full intention of
[2:22:17.580 --> 2:22:19.580]  Whether completing it
[2:22:19.580 --> 2:22:21.580]  Or if you failed, you say well
[2:22:21.580 --> 2:22:23.580]  At least I tried
[2:22:23.580 --> 2:22:25.580]  And for people
[2:22:25.580 --> 2:22:27.580]  You didn't just put those knives in the wall
[2:22:27.580 --> 2:22:29.580]  You drove them in like a machine gun
[2:22:29.580 --> 2:22:31.580]  A little bit scary
[2:22:31.580 --> 2:22:33.580]  They barely stick in the wall
[2:22:33.580 --> 2:22:35.580]  You had them pounded in there
[2:22:35.580 --> 2:22:37.580]  Just probably because I go into the gym
[2:22:37.580 --> 2:22:39.580]  But going back to
[2:22:39.580 --> 2:22:41.580]  Why people are not successful
[2:22:41.580 --> 2:22:43.580]  So if we use your analogy
[2:22:43.580 --> 2:22:45.580]  Of the throwing knives
[2:22:45.580 --> 2:22:47.580]  If someone threw a knife at the wall
[2:22:47.580 --> 2:22:49.580]  Or a board and they don't succeed
[2:22:49.580 --> 2:22:51.580]  Well they'll say maybe I'm not good
[2:22:51.580 --> 2:22:53.580]  Right, this is something I'm not good at
[2:22:53.580 --> 2:22:55.580]  And they'll quit. Now
[2:22:55.580 --> 2:22:57.580]  If someone says okay
[2:22:57.580 --> 2:22:59.580]  I'm not good at it today
[2:22:59.580 --> 2:23:01.580]  But I'm going to practice and I'm going to get better
[2:23:01.580 --> 2:23:03.580]  And they practice and they get better
[2:23:03.580 --> 2:23:05.580]  They become stronger
[2:23:05.580 --> 2:23:07.580]  And when we look at our mindset
[2:23:07.580 --> 2:23:09.580]  When we look at what needs to be done
[2:23:09.580 --> 2:23:11.580]  In the world and the society
[2:23:11.580 --> 2:23:13.580]  They get stronger
[2:23:13.580 --> 2:23:15.580]  And most people are just
[2:23:15.580 --> 2:23:17.580]  Okay with becoming followers
[2:23:17.580 --> 2:23:19.580]  Explain to me the victim
[2:23:19.580 --> 2:23:21.580]  A mentality from your angle
[2:23:21.580 --> 2:23:23.580]  And it's totally not exactly
[2:23:23.580 --> 2:23:25.580]  A victim instantly gives up
[2:23:25.580 --> 2:23:27.580]  And then looks for some group to control them
[2:23:27.580 --> 2:23:29.580]  To give them power
[2:23:29.580 --> 2:23:31.580]  Instead of saying no I'm going to get stronger
[2:23:31.580 --> 2:23:33.580]  Like Nishi said under attack
[2:23:33.580 --> 2:23:35.580]  So I've had
[2:23:35.580 --> 2:23:37.580]  Clients who are
[2:23:37.580 --> 2:23:39.580]  On the left side, right side
[2:23:39.580 --> 2:23:41.580]  They are
[2:23:41.580 --> 2:23:43.580]  Going to be more timid
[2:23:43.580 --> 2:23:45.580]  And afraid of challenges
[2:23:45.580 --> 2:23:47.580]  And that was really interesting to me
[2:23:47.580 --> 2:23:49.580]  Because why are they
[2:23:49.580 --> 2:23:51.580]  Less prone to pushing themselves
[2:23:51.580 --> 2:23:53.580]  To driving forward
[2:23:53.580 --> 2:23:55.580]  And it's just because they have been told
[2:23:55.580 --> 2:23:57.580]  Well just take it easy
[2:23:57.580 --> 2:23:59.580]  You don't have to push
[2:23:59.580 --> 2:24:01.580]  When you don't feel like it
[2:24:01.580 --> 2:24:03.580]  Just do what is comfortable for you
[2:24:03.580 --> 2:24:05.580]  The limitations were already set for them
[2:24:05.580 --> 2:24:07.580]  So the moment they quit
[2:24:07.580 --> 2:24:09.580]  The moment they give up
[2:24:09.580 --> 2:24:11.580]  They say well I guess it was not meant to be
[2:24:11.580 --> 2:24:13.580]  And obviously anybody
[2:24:13.580 --> 2:24:15.580]  Telling you that's your enemy
[2:24:15.580 --> 2:24:17.580]  I mean come on
[2:24:17.580 --> 2:24:19.580]  So for people who are putting you in a box
[2:24:19.580 --> 2:24:21.580]  And telling you that you can't do something
[2:24:21.580 --> 2:24:23.580]  Those people should be put on the back burner
[2:24:23.580 --> 2:24:25.580]  Right so yeah
[2:24:25.580 --> 2:24:27.580]  You can use them as
[2:24:27.580 --> 2:24:29.580]  As a source of your motivation
[2:24:29.580 --> 2:24:31.580]  And determination to get ahead
[2:24:31.580 --> 2:24:33.580]  In life
[2:24:33.580 --> 2:24:35.580]  Correct because you
[2:24:35.580 --> 2:24:37.580]  Learn from your environment
[2:24:37.580 --> 2:24:39.580]  So if your environment is not
[2:24:39.580 --> 2:24:41.580]  What you want it to be
[2:24:41.580 --> 2:24:43.580]  And the behaviors of the people in your environment
[2:24:43.580 --> 2:24:45.580]  Are not what you want them to be
[2:24:45.580 --> 2:24:47.580]  You have to start to change them
[2:24:47.580 --> 2:24:49.580]  So for people
[2:24:49.580 --> 2:24:51.580]  Who are stuck
[2:24:51.580 --> 2:24:53.580]  Whether it be believing they are not essential
[2:24:53.580 --> 2:24:55.580]  Believing that they can't get out
[2:24:55.580 --> 2:24:57.580]  Of the circumstances they are in
[2:24:57.580 --> 2:24:59.580]  They have to start to think in a more
[2:24:59.580 --> 2:25:01.580]  Optimistic way
[2:25:01.580 --> 2:25:03.580]  In a way where they see their future
[2:25:03.580 --> 2:25:05.580]  Is attainable
[2:25:05.580 --> 2:25:07.580]  And think about Mike how evil that is
[2:25:07.580 --> 2:25:09.580]  To say you're not essential
[2:25:09.580 --> 2:25:11.580]  That's like Hitler saying in these groups
[2:25:11.580 --> 2:25:13.580]  That is such an amazingly criminal statement
[2:25:13.580 --> 2:25:15.580]  To say you can't go outside
[2:25:15.580 --> 2:25:17.580]  You're not essential and people just
[2:25:17.580 --> 2:25:19.580]  Okay I'm not essential
[2:25:19.580 --> 2:25:21.580]  Imagine that thought to children hearing that
[2:25:21.580 --> 2:25:23.580]  Right and it's all about control
[2:25:23.580 --> 2:25:25.580]  Because if I tell you that you can't do something
[2:25:25.580 --> 2:25:27.580]  Then the most logical question
[2:25:27.580 --> 2:25:29.580]  After that is well what can I do
[2:25:29.580 --> 2:25:31.580]  And they are going to tell you what you can do
[2:25:31.580 --> 2:25:33.580]  You can stay inside
[2:25:33.580 --> 2:25:35.580]  You can stay six feet apart
[2:25:35.580 --> 2:25:37.580]  You can get this vaccine
[2:25:37.580 --> 2:25:39.580]  You can do what we tell you
[2:25:39.580 --> 2:25:41.580]  Because we know best we are in authority
[2:25:41.580 --> 2:25:43.580]  And of course those people need authority
[2:25:43.580 --> 2:25:45.580]  Those people need people to
[2:25:45.580 --> 2:25:47.580]  Tell them exactly what they need to do
[2:25:47.580 --> 2:25:49.580]  Because even some of my clients
[2:25:49.580 --> 2:25:51.580]  They would say Mike can you just tell me
[2:25:51.580 --> 2:25:53.580]  What I need to do in life because
[2:25:53.580 --> 2:25:55.580]  When you talk about clients explain
[2:25:55.580 --> 2:25:57.580]  You tell them what you do
[2:25:57.580 --> 2:25:59.580]  I should have brought that up
[2:25:59.580 --> 2:26:01.580]  But what I do is I help people
[2:26:01.580 --> 2:26:03.580]  Get to their most desired place in life
[2:26:03.580 --> 2:26:05.580]  You're a life coach
[2:26:05.580 --> 2:26:07.580]  So I primarily work with mindsets
[2:26:07.580 --> 2:26:09.580]  And I can have an array of things
[2:26:09.580 --> 2:26:11.580]  So a life coach is an umbrella
[2:26:11.580 --> 2:26:13.580]  Of the many things that I do
[2:26:13.580 --> 2:26:15.580]  So I work with relationships
[2:26:15.580 --> 2:26:17.580]  I work with career development
[2:26:17.580 --> 2:26:19.580]  And what the whole premise
[2:26:19.580 --> 2:26:21.580]  Of what a mindset coach is
[2:26:21.580 --> 2:26:23.580]  Is how you're looking at the situation
[2:26:23.580 --> 2:26:25.580]  And if you're looking at
[2:26:25.580 --> 2:26:27.580]  The situation in a negative way
[2:26:27.580 --> 2:26:29.580]  Then we just have to adjust it
[2:26:29.580 --> 2:26:31.580]  And start to go down the path
[2:26:31.580 --> 2:26:33.580]  That is going to be most ideal for you
[2:26:33.580 --> 2:26:35.580]  And by the way you've helped me out with a lot of great ideas
[2:26:35.580 --> 2:26:37.580]  They've always turned out amazing that's why
[2:26:37.580 --> 2:26:39.580]  I mean really you're an amazing brain
[2:26:39.580 --> 2:26:41.580]  But you're right I was already innately doing it
[2:26:41.580 --> 2:26:43.580]  With big attacks like okay I'm always
[2:26:43.580 --> 2:26:45.580]  Going to get the angle to take this attack like Judo
[2:26:45.580 --> 2:26:47.580]  Using against them but then in my personal life
[2:26:47.580 --> 2:26:49.580]  I wouldn't use that same thing
[2:26:49.580 --> 2:26:51.580]  No we got to use at the high level
[2:26:51.580 --> 2:26:53.580]  And the low level the same tactics
[2:26:53.580 --> 2:26:55.580]  So when you're looking
[2:26:55.580 --> 2:26:57.580]  At the basic structure especially when you're
[2:26:57.580 --> 2:26:59.580]  Talking about government education
[2:26:59.580 --> 2:27:01.580]  It has to be a step by step basis right
[2:27:01.580 --> 2:27:03.580]  You have to look at the cause and effect
[2:27:03.580 --> 2:27:05.580]  If you are
[2:27:05.580 --> 2:27:07.580]  Backing a dog to a wall
[2:27:07.580 --> 2:27:09.580]  Right and the dog is timid the dog is scared
[2:27:09.580 --> 2:27:11.580]  Eventually the dog is going to
[2:27:11.580 --> 2:27:13.580]  Attack is going to fight back
[2:27:13.580 --> 2:27:15.580]  But if you train the dog to
[2:27:15.580 --> 2:27:17.580]  Think that it is not powerful
[2:27:17.580 --> 2:27:19.580]  That it is weak it won't fight back
[2:27:19.580 --> 2:27:21.580]  So no matter how far we push you
[2:27:21.580 --> 2:27:23.580]  To the wall you're not going to do anything
[2:27:23.580 --> 2:27:25.580]  And that's where we are in society right
[2:27:25.580 --> 2:27:27.580]  People are back to the wall
[2:27:27.580 --> 2:27:29.580]  And they don't know what to do
[2:27:29.580 --> 2:27:31.580]  And they're just looking for a way out
[2:27:31.580 --> 2:27:33.580]  And I offer them a way out
[2:27:33.580 --> 2:27:35.580]  But it does require a huge
[2:27:35.580 --> 2:27:37.580]  Effort on their part because it is a challenge
[2:27:37.580 --> 2:27:39.580]  You have to overcome
[2:27:39.580 --> 2:27:41.580]  Wow I'm listening
[2:27:41.580 --> 2:27:43.580]  We're going to break in a minute but just continue
[2:27:43.580 --> 2:27:45.580]  To break that down
[2:27:45.580 --> 2:27:47.580]  So when you have
[2:27:47.580 --> 2:27:49.580]  You're back against the wall
[2:27:49.580 --> 2:27:51.580]  And you are concerned about
[2:27:51.580 --> 2:27:53.580]  Where the bills are going to be
[2:27:53.580 --> 2:27:55.580]  Coming from right so you have bills
[2:27:55.580 --> 2:27:57.580]  And you're trying to figure out
[2:27:57.580 --> 2:27:59.580]  Where's the money you're going to be coming from
[2:27:59.580 --> 2:28:01.580]  And you are doing all you can
[2:28:01.580 --> 2:28:03.580]  And then someone says that you can't do something
[2:28:03.580 --> 2:28:05.580]  Unless you do something for example the mandate
[2:28:05.580 --> 2:28:07.580]  If you don't get the vaccine you're going to lose your job
[2:28:07.580 --> 2:28:09.580]  They're using a fair based type
[2:28:09.580 --> 2:28:11.580]  Of tactic to say hey
[2:28:11.580 --> 2:28:13.580]  We're going to take what you need
[2:28:13.580 --> 2:28:15.580]  In order for us to
[2:28:15.580 --> 2:28:17.580]  Continue with our agenda
[2:28:17.580 --> 2:28:19.580]  That's the stick
[2:28:19.580 --> 2:28:21.580]  And the reason why I believe they're doing it
[2:28:21.580 --> 2:28:23.580]  Is because
[2:28:23.580 --> 2:28:25.580]  They're all about money
[2:28:25.580 --> 2:28:27.580]  And it's not so much about
[2:28:27.580 --> 2:28:29.580]  What
[2:28:29.580 --> 2:28:31.580]  Can we get away with
[2:28:31.580 --> 2:28:33.580]  Is I know I'm going to get away with it
[2:28:33.580 --> 2:28:35.580]  Because they know
[2:28:35.580 --> 2:28:37.580]  People are not going to fight back
[2:28:37.580 --> 2:28:39.580]  They know that people are going to be
[2:28:39.580 --> 2:28:41.580]  Happy in their nine to fives
[2:28:41.580 --> 2:28:43.580]  Because once someone gets in a box
[2:28:43.580 --> 2:28:45.580]  Again they don't want to leave
[2:28:45.580 --> 2:28:47.580]  Exactly, Mike Rudin stay there
[2:28:47.580 --> 2:28:49.580]  Get out of the box with Michael Rudin
[2:28:49.580 --> 2:28:51.580]  Of RevanConcepts.com
[2:28:51.580 --> 2:28:53.580]  R-E-V-E-N
[2:28:53.580 --> 2:28:55.580]  That's not even cooler than RevanConcepts
[2:28:55.580 --> 2:29:23.580]  If you're concerned about the power of RevanConcepts.com
[2:29:23.580 --> 2:29:25.580]  It is the true digital economy
[2:29:25.580 --> 2:29:27.580]  It's the spiritual economy
[2:29:27.580 --> 2:29:29.580]  Of the mind and
[2:29:29.580 --> 2:29:31.580]  Transcendent or control
[2:29:31.580 --> 2:29:33.580]  I've been on there 28 years
[2:29:33.580 --> 2:29:35.580]  And all of our work has been amazing
[2:29:35.580 --> 2:29:37.580]  Thanks to God and God's divine
[2:29:37.580 --> 2:29:39.580]  Empowerment and blessing
[2:29:39.580 --> 2:29:41.580]  But I got to tell you out of everything I've done
[2:29:41.580 --> 2:29:43.580]  Reset Wars is the most important
[2:29:43.580 --> 2:29:45.580]  And it is now available
[2:29:45.580 --> 2:29:47.580]  Now at the month of December 2021

[2:29:51.580 --> 2:29:53.580]  At resetwars.com
[2:29:53.580 --> 2:29:55.580]  The globalist fear this information
[2:29:55.580 --> 2:29:57.580]  I've been fighting as hard as I can
[2:29:57.580 --> 2:29:59.580]  For almost 28 years
[2:29:59.580 --> 2:30:01.580]  Against the globalist
[2:30:01.580 --> 2:30:03.580]  I wanted to stop their agenda
[2:30:03.580 --> 2:30:05.580]  I wanted to wake up the world
[2:30:05.580 --> 2:30:07.580]  And stop them dead in their tracks
[2:30:07.580 --> 2:30:09.580]  Before they went operational
[2:30:09.580 --> 2:30:11.580]  But we failed
[2:30:11.580 --> 2:30:13.580]  Yes, a lot of people are awake
[2:30:13.580 --> 2:30:15.580]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed
[2:30:15.580 --> 2:30:17.580]  But they are going ahead
[2:30:17.580 --> 2:30:19.580]  With their full operational
[2:30:19.580 --> 2:30:21.580]  And that's why it's more important than ever
[2:30:21.580 --> 2:30:23.580]  Than all viewers and all listeners
[2:30:23.580 --> 2:30:25.580]  Tell everybody they know about the show
[2:30:25.580 --> 2:30:27.580]  Because people are ready to wake up
[2:30:27.580 --> 2:30:29.580]  And ready to hear the truth
[2:30:29.580 --> 2:30:31.580]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[2:30:31.580 --> 2:30:33.580]  And trying to stop their agenda
[2:30:33.580 --> 2:30:35.580]  And we've also got to get personally prepared
[2:30:35.580 --> 2:30:37.580]  And one of the number one things to do
[2:30:37.580 --> 2:30:39.580]  Is high quality storeable food
[2:30:39.580 --> 2:30:41.580]  We've got the best food ready to ship
[2:30:41.580 --> 2:30:43.580]  At very affordable prices
[2:30:43.580 --> 2:30:45.580]  At infowarstore.com
[2:30:45.580 --> 2:30:47.580]  So whether it's a month or a six month or a year supply
[2:30:47.580 --> 2:30:49.580]  Your order's in before food prices go up
[2:30:49.580 --> 2:30:51.580]  And before there are long lines and waits
[2:30:51.580 --> 2:30:53.580]  Because believe me, serious times are coming
[2:30:53.580 --> 2:30:55.580]  Get ready at infowarstore.com
[2:30:55.580 --> 2:30:57.580]  Let's go ahead and take another call
[2:30:57.580 --> 2:30:59.580]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee
[2:30:59.580 --> 2:31:01.580]  Welcome. Hello Alex. Yes Malcolm
[2:31:01.580 --> 2:31:03.580]  Alright, I will make this quick and real short
[2:31:03.580 --> 2:31:05.580]  Where the other patreots can get on the line
[2:31:05.580 --> 2:31:07.580]  Uh, Alex, I have to promote one thing
[2:31:07.580 --> 2:31:09.580]  From one of your co-hosts
[2:31:09.580 --> 2:31:11.580]  Owen Shroyer
[2:31:11.580 --> 2:31:13.580]  Super metal volatility and brain force plus
[2:31:13.580 --> 2:31:15.580]  Mix those two together
[2:31:15.580 --> 2:31:17.580]  Unstoppable tank
[2:31:17.580 --> 2:31:19.580]  Super metal volatility really, really works
[2:31:19.580 --> 2:31:21.580]  It's cold pressed herbs
[2:31:21.580 --> 2:31:23.580]  And natural compounds that have never been heated up
[2:31:23.580 --> 2:31:25.580]  And so it has a dramatic effect
[2:31:25.580 --> 2:31:27.580]  Compared to powdered versions
[2:31:27.580 --> 2:31:29.580]  That also work quite well
[2:31:29.580 --> 2:31:31.580]  That just aren't as strong
[2:31:31.580 --> 2:31:33.580]  This is like a very fine wine
[2:31:33.580 --> 2:31:35.580]  In fact, each batch is different
[2:31:35.580 --> 2:31:37.580]  Sometimes it's super strong, sometimes it's just okay
[2:31:37.580 --> 2:31:39.580]  People are like, why are you selling something
[2:31:39.580 --> 2:31:41.580]  And admitting sometimes the batch isn't as strong
[2:31:41.580 --> 2:31:43.580]  That's just how it is, it's how it works
[2:31:43.580 --> 2:31:45.580]  It's always good, it's just sometimes it's like
[2:31:45.580 --> 2:31:47.580]  Super strong, but yeah
[2:31:47.580 --> 2:31:49.580]  If you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price
[2:31:49.580 --> 2:31:51.580]  Then this is it
[2:31:57.580 --> 2:31:59.580]  The globalists are bombarding us
[2:31:59.580 --> 2:32:01.580]  With propaganda and with spiritual warfare
[2:32:01.580 --> 2:32:03.580]  And with poisons and chemicals
[2:32:03.580 --> 2:32:05.580]  Added to the food, it's all come out
[2:32:05.580 --> 2:32:07.580]  And they're doing that
[2:32:07.580 --> 2:32:09.580]  Not because we're weak, but because
[2:32:09.580 --> 2:32:11.580]  We're made the image of God, the creator
[2:32:11.580 --> 2:32:13.580]  We are powerful
[2:32:13.580 --> 2:32:15.580]  And the social engineers fear that so much
[2:32:15.580 --> 2:32:17.580]  So that's why I repeat that
[2:32:17.580 --> 2:32:19.580]  Famous internet saying that nobody
[2:32:19.580 --> 2:32:21.580]  Knows who first came up with the boy
[2:32:21.580 --> 2:32:23.580]  Is it true
[2:32:23.580 --> 2:32:25.580]  The propaganda would not be
[2:32:25.580 --> 2:32:27.580]  Necessary if the situation
[2:32:27.580 --> 2:32:29.580]  Was hopeless
[2:32:29.580 --> 2:32:31.580]  They need all their propaganda
[2:32:31.580 --> 2:32:33.580]  And all their lies and all their evil
[2:32:33.580 --> 2:32:35.580]  And all their cultural death
[2:32:35.580 --> 2:32:37.580]  Because they know
[2:32:37.580 --> 2:32:39.580]  We are strong
[2:32:39.580 --> 2:32:41.580]  And they signed on the God of this world
[2:32:41.580 --> 2:32:43.580]  Who is a loser
[2:32:43.580 --> 2:32:45.580]  And that's why it's so important that everybody
[2:32:45.580 --> 2:32:47.580]  Keep them full wars in the air now more than ever
[2:32:47.580 --> 2:32:49.580]  Because even if you don't believe in God
[2:32:49.580 --> 2:32:51.580]  What the globalists are manifesting
[2:32:51.580 --> 2:32:53.580]  Setting up is safe hand
[2:32:53.580 --> 2:32:55.580]  And we are opposing the one world government
[2:32:55.580 --> 2:33:23.580]  Please stay just announced
[2:33:23.580 --> 2:33:25.580]  In the United States
[2:33:25.580 --> 2:33:27.580]  In Europe, in Asia
[2:33:27.580 --> 2:33:29.580]  Corporations are running big promotions
[2:33:29.580 --> 2:33:31.580]  For people to get microchips
[2:33:31.580 --> 2:33:33.580]  And planet that include vaccine records
[2:33:33.580 --> 2:33:35.580]  Amid new COVID restrictions
[2:33:35.580 --> 2:33:37.580]  This is all an exercise
[2:33:37.580 --> 2:33:39.580]  And enslavement
[2:33:39.580 --> 2:33:41.580]  And you notice the people that give in
[2:33:41.580 --> 2:33:43.580]  Only get more enslaved
[2:33:43.580 --> 2:33:45.580]  So Michael Reardon, continue please
[2:33:45.580 --> 2:33:47.580]  I mean, let them have it because you're doing a great job on air
[2:33:47.580 --> 2:33:49.580]  But we've talked privately, you're just on fire
[2:33:49.580 --> 2:33:51.580]  And you totally get what's going on
[2:33:51.580 --> 2:33:53.580]  People to understand that the only thing they have to lose
[2:33:53.580 --> 2:33:55.580]  Is not waking up and saying no
[2:33:55.580 --> 2:33:57.580]  And say I'm not a victim
[2:33:57.580 --> 2:33:59.580]  Victimhood is not like a deed on the universe
[2:33:59.580 --> 2:34:01.580]  It's the opposite
[2:34:01.580 --> 2:34:03.580]  So keep explaining that to people
[2:34:03.580 --> 2:34:05.580]  How we get out of victimology
[2:34:05.580 --> 2:34:07.580]  And how we get into victoryology
[2:34:07.580 --> 2:34:09.580]  So most people tip through
[2:34:09.580 --> 2:34:11.580]  Are going to be tiptoeing through life
[2:34:11.580 --> 2:34:13.580]  Only to make it safely to death
[2:34:13.580 --> 2:34:15.580]  And for those type of people
[2:34:15.580 --> 2:34:17.580]  I tell them to get loud
[2:34:17.580 --> 2:34:19.580]  And then how to get loud
[2:34:19.580 --> 2:34:21.580]  Because most people want to make a difference
[2:34:21.580 --> 2:34:23.580]  They want to make a change in their life
[2:34:23.580 --> 2:34:25.580]  But they don't even know where to begin
[2:34:25.580 --> 2:34:27.580]  And I know you're doing reset wars
[2:34:27.580 --> 2:34:29.580]  And reset wars is a great way
[2:34:29.580 --> 2:34:31.580]  For people to wake up
[2:34:31.580 --> 2:34:33.580]  And say oh wow
[2:34:33.580 --> 2:34:35.580]  This is what's possible in my life
[2:34:35.580 --> 2:34:37.580]  And what I do whether it be
[2:34:37.580 --> 2:34:39.580]  Motivational positive talk
[2:34:39.580 --> 2:34:41.580]  The podcast
[2:34:41.580 --> 2:34:43.580]  I'm helping people start to see
[2:34:43.580 --> 2:34:45.580]  What is possible
[2:34:45.580 --> 2:34:47.580]  And helping them get loud
[2:34:47.580 --> 2:34:49.580]  Because the voices
[2:34:49.580 --> 2:34:51.580]  Of the American citizens
[2:34:51.580 --> 2:34:53.580]  Are being muffled
[2:34:53.580 --> 2:34:55.580]  From our First Amendment right
[2:34:55.580 --> 2:34:57.580]  To the censorship
[2:34:57.580 --> 2:34:59.580]  On social media
[2:34:59.580 --> 2:35:01.580]  You can't go out and say
[2:35:01.580 --> 2:35:03.580]  What you want anymore
[2:35:03.580 --> 2:35:05.580]  If you use the word COVID on
[2:35:05.580 --> 2:35:07.580]  YouTube You're automatically hit
[2:35:07.580 --> 2:35:09.580]  With a little mark saying
[2:35:09.580 --> 2:35:11.580]  Make sure you get your COVID information
[2:35:11.580 --> 2:35:13.580]  From the right place CDC
[2:35:13.580 --> 2:35:15.580]  And CDC can do whatever they want
[2:35:15.580 --> 2:35:17.580]  And change the definition
[2:35:17.580 --> 2:35:19.580]  Of a vaccine
[2:35:19.580 --> 2:35:21.580]  The Webster dictionary
[2:35:21.580 --> 2:35:23.580]  Just changed the definition
[2:35:23.580 --> 2:35:25.580]  Of anti-vaxxer
[2:35:25.580 --> 2:35:27.580]  And they label you
[2:35:27.580 --> 2:35:29.580]  They say well if you're anti-vaxxer
[2:35:29.580 --> 2:35:31.580]  You're now going to be a person
[2:35:31.580 --> 2:35:33.580]  Who needs to be watched
[2:35:33.580 --> 2:35:35.580]  What you're saying is when they try to suppress you
[2:35:35.580 --> 2:35:37.580]  The answer is do the opposite
[2:35:37.580 --> 2:35:39.580]  Yes and no
[2:35:39.580 --> 2:35:41.580]  So when they're trying to suppress you
[2:35:41.580 --> 2:35:43.580]  You have to pay attention
[2:35:43.580 --> 2:35:45.580]  To how they're moving because if they're moving
[2:35:45.580 --> 2:35:47.580]  In a certain way
[2:35:47.580 --> 2:35:49.580]  If you look at
[2:35:49.580 --> 2:35:51.580]  A martial arts like Habquito for example
[2:35:51.580 --> 2:35:53.580]  You use the enemy's momentum against them
[2:35:53.580 --> 2:35:55.580]  So when you figure out
[2:35:55.580 --> 2:35:57.580]  What they're doing
[2:35:57.580 --> 2:35:59.580]  You say okay I understand what you're doing
[2:35:59.580 --> 2:36:01.580]  And then there's going to be
[2:36:01.580 --> 2:36:03.580]  A
[2:36:03.580 --> 2:36:05.580]  Like a
[2:36:05.580 --> 2:36:07.580]  A move you do that's going to counteract
[2:36:07.580 --> 2:36:09.580]  What they do
[2:36:09.580 --> 2:36:11.580]  So if they're forcing you into a corner
[2:36:11.580 --> 2:36:13.580]  The only thing you have to do is pivot
[2:36:13.580 --> 2:36:15.580]  You don't have to get
[2:36:15.580 --> 2:36:17.580]  You don't have to get pushed into the corner
[2:36:17.580 --> 2:36:19.580]  A lot of people don't know how to pivot
[2:36:19.580 --> 2:36:21.580]  So if they say for example
[2:36:21.580 --> 2:36:23.580]  You had to pivot when they banned you
[2:36:23.580 --> 2:36:25.580]  They say Alex Jones was banned on YouTube
[2:36:25.580 --> 2:36:27.580]  He's banned here and there
[2:36:27.580 --> 2:36:29.580]  And now he's one of the most banned
[2:36:29.580 --> 2:36:31.580]  Men in America
[2:36:31.580 --> 2:36:33.580]  But you didn't say well
[2:36:33.580 --> 2:36:35.580]  I guess I'm done you pivot
[2:36:35.580 --> 2:36:37.580]  And when you did that
[2:36:37.580 --> 2:36:39.580]  Now they're like well he's a force
[2:36:39.580 --> 2:36:41.580]  To be reckoned with
[2:36:41.580 --> 2:36:43.580]  And now they're going after you
[2:36:43.580 --> 2:36:45.580]  So ferociously
[2:36:45.580 --> 2:36:47.580]  Because they understand you're
[2:36:47.580 --> 2:36:49.580]  The highest level of leader
[2:36:49.580 --> 2:36:51.580]  You are a transformational type
[2:36:51.580 --> 2:36:53.580]  Leader and a transformational type
[2:36:53.580 --> 2:36:55.580]  Leader is going to be a person
[2:36:55.580 --> 2:36:57.580]  Who has the highest level of engagement
[2:36:57.580 --> 2:36:59.580]  And the highest level of effort
[2:36:59.580 --> 2:37:01.580]  To help empower people
[2:37:01.580 --> 2:37:03.580]  To be in a better place
[2:37:03.580 --> 2:37:05.580]  And to see what they're unable to see
[2:37:05.580 --> 2:37:07.580]  And as much as
[2:37:07.580 --> 2:37:09.580]  I want people to see the truth
[2:37:09.580 --> 2:37:11.580]  And I say hey the government is doing this to you
[2:37:11.580 --> 2:37:13.580]  They're playing you
[2:37:13.580 --> 2:37:15.580]  They're using fear to influence your choices
[2:37:15.580 --> 2:37:17.580]  And your decisions in life
[2:37:17.580 --> 2:37:19.580]  Regardless of that
[2:37:19.580 --> 2:37:21.580]  Some people cannot see the other side
[2:37:21.580 --> 2:37:23.580]  Regardless of how you put it
[2:37:23.580 --> 2:37:25.580]  So how do we get people
[2:37:25.580 --> 2:37:27.580]  To start to see the other side
[2:37:27.580 --> 2:37:29.580]  And it's by small steps
[2:37:29.580 --> 2:37:31.580]  You have to do it slowly
[2:37:31.580 --> 2:37:33.580]  You can't scare these people
[2:37:33.580 --> 2:37:35.580]  Right they're sheep
[2:37:35.580 --> 2:37:37.580]  So these people who are
[2:37:37.580 --> 2:37:39.580]  Afraid of their own shadow
[2:37:39.580 --> 2:37:41.580]  You have to not say
[2:37:41.580 --> 2:37:43.580]  Well the government's the problem
[2:37:43.580 --> 2:37:45.580]  You have to say well what's your problem
[2:37:45.580 --> 2:37:47.580]  First and now we're talking about you
[2:37:47.580 --> 2:37:49.580]  Because you're comfortable with you
[2:37:49.580 --> 2:37:51.580]  You was already in your comfort zone
[2:37:51.580 --> 2:37:53.580]  And now we're talking about
[2:37:53.580 --> 2:37:55.580]  How we can get better
[2:37:55.580 --> 2:37:57.580]  And then we start to look at the obstacles
[2:37:57.580 --> 2:37:59.580]  That is stopping you from leaving
[2:37:59.580 --> 2:38:01.580]  That type of comfort zone
[2:38:01.580 --> 2:38:03.580]  Stopping you from achieving more in your life
[2:38:03.580 --> 2:38:05.580]  Just when we get them out of the trance
[2:38:05.580 --> 2:38:07.580]  And baby steps and I agree with you
[2:38:07.580 --> 2:38:09.580]  About a month ago I was talking about
[2:38:09.580 --> 2:38:11.580]  And you said you talk about packets
[2:38:11.580 --> 2:38:13.580]  They don't care that they said
[2:38:13.580 --> 2:38:15.580]  Oh you only need one vaccine
[2:38:15.580 --> 2:38:17.580]  They feel good while they're in it
[2:38:17.580 --> 2:38:19.580]  They only believe in the perception
[2:38:19.580 --> 2:38:21.580]  Not the reality of how it works
[2:38:21.580 --> 2:38:23.580]  But you had a great way of putting that
[2:38:23.580 --> 2:38:25.580]  So once you start something
[2:38:25.580 --> 2:38:27.580]  Right the process
[2:38:27.580 --> 2:38:29.580]  It's easy for you to keep on going
[2:38:29.580 --> 2:38:31.580]  With whatever the agenda is
[2:38:31.580 --> 2:38:33.580]  If they give you one
[2:38:33.580 --> 2:38:35.580]  They said well you have to take another one
[2:38:35.580 --> 2:38:37.580]  Well it's not that big of a deal
[2:38:37.580 --> 2:38:39.580]  I already did it once
[2:38:39.580 --> 2:38:41.580]  And when it comes to
[2:38:41.580 --> 2:38:43.580]  Switching that around
[2:38:43.580 --> 2:38:45.580]  So people are not telling us what to do
[2:38:45.580 --> 2:38:47.580]  But instead of what we can do
[2:38:47.580 --> 2:38:49.580]  If we put it back into the steps
[2:38:49.580 --> 2:38:51.580]  Where it's going to be approachable
[2:38:51.580 --> 2:38:53.580]  People are going to be more prone
[2:38:53.580 --> 2:38:55.580]  To take those steps
[2:38:55.580 --> 2:38:57.580]  Now the problem is people don't even understand
[2:38:57.580 --> 2:38:59.580]  That there is going to be an alternate solution
[2:38:59.580 --> 2:39:01.580]  Well now you can
[2:39:01.580 --> 2:39:03.580]  Become more healthy
[2:39:03.580 --> 2:39:05.580]  Going to the gym
[2:39:05.580 --> 2:39:07.580]  Eating healthy
[2:39:07.580 --> 2:39:09.580]  Making sure you are in the best shape of your life
[2:39:09.580 --> 2:39:11.580]  And notice how they try to block all that
[2:39:11.580 --> 2:39:13.580]  Alternative treatments
[2:39:13.580 --> 2:39:15.580]  Everything
[2:39:15.580 --> 2:39:17.580]  I believe Joe Biden was on the news the other day
[2:39:17.580 --> 2:39:19.580]  He was talking about hurricanes and tornadoes
[2:39:19.580 --> 2:39:21.580]  And Florida and Texas
[2:39:21.580 --> 2:39:23.580]  And he says the best way to combat this
[2:39:23.580 --> 2:39:25.580]  Is to get the vaccine
[2:39:25.580 --> 2:39:27.580]  And that doesn't make any sense
[2:39:27.580 --> 2:39:29.580]  Using fear is any fear of him
[2:39:29.580 --> 2:39:31.580]  So he is saying
[2:39:31.580 --> 2:39:33.580]  If you don't want to get hit by a hurricane
[2:39:33.580 --> 2:39:35.580]  Or a tornado
[2:39:35.580 --> 2:39:37.580]  Or anything that happens to your loved ones
[2:39:37.580 --> 2:39:39.580]  You make sure that you are getting a vaccine
[2:39:39.580 --> 2:39:41.580]  This is like a rabbit's foot
[2:39:41.580 --> 2:39:43.580]  As for luck
[2:39:43.580 --> 2:39:45.580]  Well he is saying take the shot
[2:39:45.580 --> 2:39:47.580]  The hurricane won't hit you
[2:39:47.580 --> 2:39:49.580]  So he is basically using fear
[2:39:49.580 --> 2:39:51.580]  As his prime motivator
[2:39:51.580 --> 2:39:53.580]  To enact
[2:39:53.580 --> 2:39:55.580]  People to make a choice
[2:39:55.580 --> 2:39:57.580]  And that choice is to become vaccinated
[2:39:57.580 --> 2:39:59.580]  And I'm not anti-vaccine
[2:39:59.580 --> 2:40:01.580]  Where I'm not saying
[2:40:01.580 --> 2:40:03.580]  To not get the chicken pox
[2:40:03.580 --> 2:40:05.580]  Shot or to get a measles shot
[2:40:05.580 --> 2:40:07.580]  Do your research
[2:40:07.580 --> 2:40:09.580]  And for a vaccine
[2:40:09.580 --> 2:40:11.580]  Like the COVID-19 vaccine
[2:40:11.580 --> 2:40:13.580]  You have to ask yourself do you need it
[2:40:13.580 --> 2:40:15.580]  And
[2:40:15.580 --> 2:40:17.580]  Most people are not going to need it
[2:40:17.580 --> 2:40:19.580]  It's just that they feel like they need it
[2:40:19.580 --> 2:40:21.580]  In order to be safe
[2:40:21.580 --> 2:40:23.580]  And for those people I'd like to think of it
[2:40:23.580 --> 2:40:25.580]  As if
[2:40:25.580 --> 2:40:27.580]  Someone wants to
[2:40:27.580 --> 2:40:29.580]  Carry a firearm
[2:40:29.580 --> 2:40:31.580]  And they believe that firearm
[2:40:31.580 --> 2:40:33.580]  Is going to keep them safe
[2:40:33.580 --> 2:40:35.580]  That is going to be just a certain way of thinking
[2:40:35.580 --> 2:40:37.580]  Now we have people who think
[2:40:37.580 --> 2:40:39.580]  They need a vaccine in order to feel safe
[2:40:39.580 --> 2:40:41.580]  And for that way
[2:40:41.580 --> 2:40:43.580]  Of thinking is going to lead
[2:40:43.580 --> 2:40:45.580]  To limitations down the road
[2:40:45.580 --> 2:40:47.580]  Because now if they have
[2:40:47.580 --> 2:40:49.580]  One vaccine they need to
[2:40:49.580 --> 2:40:51.580]  Second they need the booster
[2:40:51.580 --> 2:40:53.580]  And realize it's just going to be the flu shot
[2:40:53.580 --> 2:40:55.580]  They need to get it every single year
[2:40:55.580 --> 2:40:57.580]  What is happening
[2:40:57.580 --> 2:40:59.580]  With the vaccine is that
[2:40:59.580 --> 2:41:01.580]  Now we have people who are going to be
[2:41:01.580 --> 2:41:03.580]  Getting this vaccine
[2:41:03.580 --> 2:41:05.580]  And they're thanking the government
[2:41:05.580 --> 2:41:07.580]  Thank you government for saving me
[2:41:07.580 --> 2:41:09.580]  For protecting me
[2:41:09.580 --> 2:41:11.580]  And now no matter what the government does
[2:41:11.580 --> 2:41:13.580]  They're the good guys
[2:41:13.580 --> 2:41:15.580]  And as long as they're the good guys
[2:41:15.580 --> 2:41:17.580]  We're not going to fight them
[2:41:17.580 --> 2:41:19.580]  We're not going to say you're doing wrong
[2:41:19.580 --> 2:41:21.580]  Because they're the heroes
[2:41:21.580 --> 2:41:23.580]  In those people's eyes
[2:41:23.580 --> 2:41:25.580]  And I interrupted you earlier with a break
[2:41:25.580 --> 2:41:27.580]  But how do you get somebody out of that Stockholm syndrome
[2:41:27.580 --> 2:41:29.580]  Where you're saying
[2:41:29.580 --> 2:41:31.580]  Trying to hit them with the head doesn't work sometimes
[2:41:31.580 --> 2:41:33.580]  Incremental you're like well let's talk about you
[2:41:33.580 --> 2:41:35.580]  Let's talk about
[2:41:35.580 --> 2:41:37.580]  So you have to challenge their beliefs
[2:41:37.580 --> 2:41:39.580]  And when you
[2:41:39.580 --> 2:41:41.580]  Place the truth in front of them
[2:41:41.580 --> 2:41:43.580]  They are going to want to turn their head
[2:41:43.580 --> 2:41:45.580]  They're going to say no no no that's wrong
[2:41:45.580 --> 2:41:47.580]  That's wrong and you keep doing it
[2:41:47.580 --> 2:41:49.580]  And you do it in the sense of
[2:41:49.580 --> 2:41:51.580]  Non-invasive so
[2:41:51.580 --> 2:41:53.580]  If you think of it encroaching
[2:41:53.580 --> 2:41:55.580]  So I'm going to encroach until they
[2:41:55.580 --> 2:41:57.580]  Protest
[2:41:57.580 --> 2:41:59.580]  And then they're going to protest
[2:41:59.580 --> 2:42:01.580]  And they're going to say no no no this is not true
[2:42:01.580 --> 2:42:03.580]  And then you wait
[2:42:03.580 --> 2:42:05.580]  And then they forget
[2:42:05.580 --> 2:42:07.580]  And then as soon as they forget
[2:42:07.580 --> 2:42:09.580]  You encroach again
[2:42:09.580 --> 2:42:11.580]  And you keep doing it to the point where they're like
[2:42:11.580 --> 2:42:13.580]  Now I'm in the truth
[2:42:13.580 --> 2:42:15.580]  And I can't deny it
[2:42:15.580 --> 2:42:17.580]  I can't hide in being asleep
[2:42:17.580 --> 2:42:19.580]  So you like you watch them jump back into being asleep
[2:42:19.580 --> 2:42:21.580]  And you wait till they wake back up again I guess
[2:42:21.580 --> 2:42:23.580]  Right and you just have to kind of go
[2:42:23.580 --> 2:42:25.580]  Through that
[2:42:25.580 --> 2:42:27.580]  That
[2:42:27.580 --> 2:42:29.580]  Jigsaw or whatever
[2:42:29.580 --> 2:42:31.580]  Of putting the pieces together
[2:42:31.580 --> 2:42:33.580]  But in the way where they don't notice
[2:42:33.580 --> 2:42:35.580]  That the puzzle is becoming complete
[2:42:35.580 --> 2:42:37.580]  And we're telling them this is the truth
[2:42:37.580 --> 2:42:39.580]  This is no longer
[2:42:39.580 --> 2:42:41.580]  Going to be a facade
[2:42:41.580 --> 2:42:43.580]  That people are telling you that it's the truth
[2:42:43.580 --> 2:42:45.580]  That they're really alive
[2:42:45.580 --> 2:42:47.580]  Because most of what's happening
[2:42:47.580 --> 2:42:49.580]  Especially on mainstream media
[2:42:49.580 --> 2:42:51.580]  Is opinion
[2:42:51.580 --> 2:42:53.580]  That's about choosing what delusion you want
[2:42:53.580 --> 2:42:55.580]  RevanConcepts.com
[2:42:55.580 --> 2:42:57.580]  RevanConcepts.com
[2:42:57.580 --> 2:42:59.580]  So this could be
[2:42:59.580 --> 2:43:01.580]  This could be in full wars last Christmas
[2:43:01.580 --> 2:43:03.580]  Because it could be America's last Christmas
[2:43:03.580 --> 2:43:05.580]  Evil is taking over the planet
[2:43:05.580 --> 2:43:07.580]  They're destroying our borders
[2:43:07.580 --> 2:43:09.580]  Our sovereignty, our supply chains
[2:43:09.580 --> 2:43:11.580]  Our language, our currencies
[2:43:11.580 --> 2:43:13.580]  They're coming after us
[2:43:13.580 --> 2:43:15.580]  And if we don't support American businesses
[2:43:15.580 --> 2:43:17.580]  And if we don't support independent media
[2:43:17.580 --> 2:43:19.580]  In the final days of 2021
[2:43:19.580 --> 2:43:21.580]  We have no future in the midterms
[2:43:21.580 --> 2:43:23.580]  In 2022
[2:43:23.580 --> 2:43:25.580]  2022 is the year where America
[2:43:25.580 --> 2:43:27.580]  Decides its fate
[2:43:27.580 --> 2:43:29.580]  I want to thank you all for your support
[2:43:29.580 --> 2:43:31.580]  I want to encourage you to your Christmas shopping
[2:43:31.580 --> 2:43:33.580]  In full wars store.com
[2:43:33.580 --> 2:43:35.580]  Because I can barely keep our operation going
[2:43:35.580 --> 2:43:37.580]  And I appreciate you keeping us in the position
[2:43:37.580 --> 2:43:39.580]  To fight back. I am so thankful for you
[2:43:39.580 --> 2:43:41.580]  Now to realize the huge investment you made
[2:43:41.580 --> 2:43:43.580]  Over the years in us and I'll redouble
[2:43:43.580 --> 2:43:45.580]  Your efforts to make sure

[2:43:55.580 --> 2:43:57.580]  And keep us on the air. Thank you
[2:43:57.580 --> 2:43:59.580]  I want to explain something
[2:43:59.580 --> 2:44:01.580]  That is absolutely
[2:44:01.580 --> 2:44:03.580]  Seed understanding our world
[2:44:03.580 --> 2:44:05.580]  That's very, very simple but to most people don't know
[2:44:05.580 --> 2:44:07.580]  The privately owned central banks
[2:44:07.580 --> 2:44:09.580]  Of the world
[2:44:09.580 --> 2:44:11.580]  Are artificially creating
[2:44:11.580 --> 2:44:13.580]  Thousands of trillions of dollars
[2:44:13.580 --> 2:44:15.580]  And other major currencies
[2:44:15.580 --> 2:44:17.580]  And using them to buy up
[2:44:17.580 --> 2:44:19.580]  Infrastructure, intellectual
[2:44:19.580 --> 2:44:21.580]  Property, energy
[2:44:21.580 --> 2:44:23.580]  They're using it to buy people
[2:44:23.580 --> 2:44:25.580]  To buy influence
[2:44:25.580 --> 2:44:27.580]  And in the past they created thousands
[2:44:27.580 --> 2:44:29.580]  Of trillions so that they could
[2:44:29.580 --> 2:44:31.580]  Leverage that manipulated market
[2:44:31.580 --> 2:44:33.580]  So they never allowed that money
[2:44:33.580 --> 2:44:35.580]  To get into the general circulation
[2:44:35.580 --> 2:44:37.580]  Now they've gone ahead and weaponized it
[2:44:37.580 --> 2:44:39.580]  And are flooding
[2:44:39.580 --> 2:44:41.580]  Every sector of the world economy
[2:44:41.580 --> 2:44:43.580]  Buying up everything
[2:44:43.580 --> 2:44:45.580]  Not to have the companies operate
[2:44:45.580 --> 2:44:47.580]  But to actually shut them down
[2:44:47.580 --> 2:44:49.580]  And force the collapse of civilization
[2:44:49.580 --> 2:44:51.580]  Making the companies they do fund
[2:44:51.580 --> 2:44:53.580]  The only things left standing
[2:44:53.580 --> 2:44:55.580]  This is the great reset, this is what's happening now
[2:44:55.580 --> 2:44:57.580]  Warn everyone, it's the only way to stop it
[2:44:59.580 --> 2:45:01.580]  What are champions made of?
[2:45:01.580 --> 2:45:03.580]  Here's a man who can show you
[2:45:03.580 --> 2:45:07.500]  alles
[2:45:09.580 --> 2:45:11.500]  Trible 8, 25, 33139
[2:45:11.500 --> 2:45:13.580]  Trible 8, 25, 33139
[2:45:13.580 --> 2:45:15.500]  Trible 8, 25, 33139
[2:45:25.500 --> 2:45:27.500]  Trible 8,253139
[2:45:27.500 --> 2:45:29.500]  Trible 8,253139
[2:45:29.500 --> 2:45:31.500]  Triple 8,253139
[2:45:31.500 --> 2:45:33.500]  There's the info or store timeline
[2:45:33.500 --> 2:45:36.500]  Info Warstore.com is simply the best.
[2:45:36.500 --> 2:45:39.500]  Info Warstore.com beats out all the rest.

[2:45:41.500 --> 2:45:43.500]  Triple A to 531.39.
[2:45:43.500 --> 2:45:46.500]  Triple A to 531.39 is the info war store online.

[2:45:52.500 --> 2:45:55.500]  Triple A to 531.39.
[2:45:55.500 --> 2:45:57.500]  That's infowarstore.com.
[2:45:57.500 --> 2:46:01.500]  Get our great, in a bag of it here.
[2:46:01.500 --> 2:46:02.500]  I mean this is from, people say,
[2:46:02.500 --> 2:46:05.940]  Why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[2:46:05.940 --> 2:46:08.220]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[2:46:08.220 --> 2:46:11.940]  that's wild harvested above organic in the volcanic soil,
[2:46:11.940 --> 2:46:13.260]  better than Guatemalan coffee.
[2:46:13.260 --> 2:46:15.300]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[2:46:15.300 --> 2:46:16.860]  that the media calls communists,
[2:46:16.860 --> 2:46:18.020]  but really they're just a commune.
[2:46:18.020 --> 2:46:20.300]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee
[2:46:20.300 --> 2:46:21.140]  and we've got it.
[2:46:21.140 --> 2:46:23.260]  And the farmers don't let the Mexican government take over.
[2:46:23.260 --> 2:46:25.060]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels
[2:46:25.060 --> 2:46:26.660]  and I've been buying it for what, 14 years
[2:46:26.660 --> 2:46:27.740]  and the price has never gone up.
[2:46:27.740 --> 2:46:29.820]  The same stuff sold at Whole Foods under another name
[2:46:29.820 --> 2:46:31.900]  for about 50% more per pound.
[2:46:31.900 --> 2:46:33.460]  And I just think it's some of the best coffee
[2:46:33.460 --> 2:46:34.540]  that you're gonna find anywhere.
[2:46:34.540 --> 2:46:36.380]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend
[2:46:36.380 --> 2:46:38.940]  from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[2:46:38.940 --> 2:46:41.140]  In fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story.
[2:46:43.580 --> 2:46:46.060]  We had like that, you wouldn't believe it.
[2:46:46.060 --> 2:46:48.900]  Anyway, so it's infowarstore.com
[2:46:48.900 --> 2:46:50.580]  and that's how we fund this operation.
[2:46:50.580 --> 2:47:05.580]  And if you don't find us, you don't want us here, that's fine.
[2:47:11.580 --> 2:47:13.380]  All right, Michael Reardon's here with us.
[2:47:13.380 --> 2:47:14.260]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:47:14.260 --> 2:47:16.340]  J. Dyer takes over in the next hour
[2:47:16.340 --> 2:47:18.540]  and I want to get Reardon back in here soon
[2:47:18.540 --> 2:47:21.540]  because we're just getting him going here on air.
[2:47:22.540 --> 2:47:26.140]  ReardonConcepts.com, R-E-V-E-N Concepts.com.
[2:47:27.060 --> 2:47:29.260]  You know, here's what I know.
[2:47:29.260 --> 2:47:33.340]  What I understand is how the globalists actually operate.
[2:47:33.340 --> 2:47:34.900]  Once you study it, you learn more and more.
[2:47:34.900 --> 2:47:36.540]  It's like you progress through levels.
[2:47:36.540 --> 2:47:37.980]  I know what's gonna happen in the stock market.
[2:47:37.980 --> 2:47:39.660]  I know what's gonna happen in so many levels.
[2:47:39.660 --> 2:47:43.260]  And I'm trying to get the public to realize all this.
[2:47:43.260 --> 2:47:44.900]  Instead, the globalists want to keep people dumb
[2:47:44.900 --> 2:47:46.660]  and controllable, which why would you live in a world
[2:47:46.660 --> 2:47:48.620]  like that with a bunch of dumb sheep?
[2:47:48.620 --> 2:47:51.020]  That's dangerous, but that's really the split here.
[2:47:51.020 --> 2:47:53.620]  And you were talking during the break about influence
[2:47:53.620 --> 2:47:55.300]  and that key term.
[2:47:55.300 --> 2:47:59.380]  Right, so when you go to school to become an educator,
[2:47:59.380 --> 2:48:03.340]  they are going to focus on the psychology of learning,
[2:48:03.340 --> 2:48:07.260]  the mind, and you're going to learn how people
[2:48:07.260 --> 2:48:11.140]  are going to become the person you want them to become.
[2:48:11.140 --> 2:48:13.540]  So if you're in kindergarten, they learn a certain way.
[2:48:13.540 --> 2:48:15.700]  If you're in college, they learn a certain way.
[2:48:15.700 --> 2:48:19.140]  And you have to present it in a way they understand.
[2:48:19.140 --> 2:48:22.100]  So when I was teaching various grades,
[2:48:22.100 --> 2:48:24.540]  it required me to know the influence I needed
[2:48:24.540 --> 2:48:28.180]  to input into that type of classroom.
[2:48:28.180 --> 2:48:30.100]  So it's going to be different learning
[2:48:30.100 --> 2:48:32.740]  from kindergarten versus college.
[2:48:32.740 --> 2:48:37.420]  And now that we are out in the open, right,
[2:48:37.420 --> 2:48:40.020]  with all that's going on in the world,
[2:48:40.020 --> 2:48:42.740]  the influence is mainstream media.
[2:48:42.740 --> 2:48:47.740]  They are knowing what they need to do in order
[2:48:47.740 --> 2:48:49.340]  to make you feel a certain way.
[2:48:49.340 --> 2:48:53.140]  And they use fear as the premise.
[2:48:53.140 --> 2:48:55.500]  And what a good educator would do
[2:48:55.500 --> 2:49:00.060]  is to use positivity as the way to do it.
[2:49:00.060 --> 2:49:02.260]  And it has to be in small bite steps, of course,
[2:49:02.260 --> 2:49:06.700]  because if I go ahead and I give you a challenge that
[2:49:06.700 --> 2:49:10.140]  seems so far out of reach, your mind subconsciously
[2:49:10.140 --> 2:49:13.460]  is going to say, whoa, buddy, that doesn't make any sense.
[2:49:13.460 --> 2:49:16.820]  But if I put it in a sense where your mind sees it
[2:49:16.820 --> 2:49:19.380]  as approachable, then it's going to be different.
[2:49:19.380 --> 2:49:24.340]  Because if I just use a two by four as you were saying earlier
[2:49:24.340 --> 2:49:26.660]  and I try to bang it over your head saying, hey,
[2:49:26.660 --> 2:49:27.380]  you need to listen.
[2:49:27.380 --> 2:49:28.420]  This is what's happening.
[2:49:28.420 --> 2:49:30.180]  Wake up, wake up, wake up.
[2:49:30.180 --> 2:49:31.820]  You can't shake them awake.
[2:49:31.820 --> 2:49:34.660]  You have to gently say, well, come here.
[2:49:34.660 --> 2:49:36.180]  Let's wake up together.
[2:49:36.180 --> 2:49:37.540]  Get some coffee over here.
[2:49:37.540 --> 2:49:38.580]  Yeah, just have some coffee.
[2:49:38.580 --> 2:49:39.660]  Just have some tea.
[2:49:39.660 --> 2:49:42.740]  And let's get you awake.
[2:49:42.740 --> 2:49:45.180]  But it has to be approachable.
[2:49:45.180 --> 2:49:47.460]  And when you face a challenge, you
[2:49:47.460 --> 2:49:51.340]  have to face it in the sense of, how can we break this down
[2:49:51.340 --> 2:49:53.220]  in the most approachable steps?
[2:49:53.220 --> 2:49:54.980]  Think of weight loss, for example.
[2:49:54.980 --> 2:49:56.980]  You don't say you're going to lose 100 pounds.
[2:49:56.980 --> 2:49:59.500]  You say, well, I'm going to lose five pounds first.
[2:49:59.500 --> 2:50:02.140]  And then you're going to lose, OK, well, I look great now.
[2:50:02.140 --> 2:50:04.660]  But let me see what happens if I lose 10 pounds.
[2:50:04.660 --> 2:50:06.020]  And you start that process.
[2:50:06.020 --> 2:50:08.820]  Because if you say you're going to lose 100 pounds,
[2:50:08.820 --> 2:50:11.580]  the probability of you reaching that goal
[2:50:11.580 --> 2:50:13.820]  is going to be minuscule versus, if you say you're
[2:50:13.820 --> 2:50:15.340]  going to lose five pounds.
[2:50:15.340 --> 2:50:19.100]  There's going to be a compound effect of having a success,
[2:50:19.100 --> 2:50:20.580]  having more success.
[2:50:20.580 --> 2:50:23.100]  And the more you achieve, then you're
[2:50:23.100 --> 2:50:25.780]  going to start to see more progress down the way.
[2:50:25.780 --> 2:50:27.740]  And you mentioned this when we've talked privately.
[2:50:27.740 --> 2:50:29.660]  But imagine a five-year-old child,
[2:50:29.660 --> 2:50:32.260]  be they brown or white or whatever the color they are.
[2:50:32.260 --> 2:50:33.460]  They're in school hearing.
[2:50:33.460 --> 2:50:36.100]  There might be bad because of what color they are.
[2:50:36.100 --> 2:50:38.580]  I could imagine that would really screw a child up.
[2:50:38.580 --> 2:50:40.060]  Because when I was in elementary school,
[2:50:40.060 --> 2:50:41.740]  I was really insecure and nervous about everything.
[2:50:41.740 --> 2:50:43.300]  And nobody was even being mean to me.
[2:50:43.300 --> 2:50:44.900]  I couldn't imagine, like, if I was
[2:50:44.900 --> 2:50:47.180]  told I was bad because I was black or white,
[2:50:47.180 --> 2:50:48.780]  I mean, that is serious abuse.
[2:50:48.780 --> 2:50:51.820]  Right, and that's just going to be influence, right?
[2:50:51.820 --> 2:50:54.660]  How can I influence you to think the way I want?
[2:50:54.660 --> 2:50:59.620]  And for children nowadays, if we look at the children just
[2:50:59.620 --> 2:51:01.820]  walking around while their parents are not wearing a mask,
[2:51:01.820 --> 2:51:04.900]  but the children are wearing a mask, how did that happen?
[2:51:04.900 --> 2:51:06.100]  It happens in school, right?
[2:51:06.100 --> 2:51:07.340]  You have to wear your mask in school.
[2:51:07.340 --> 2:51:08.740]  You have to wear your mask at that.
[2:51:08.740 --> 2:51:10.220]  There's songs telling kindergarteners.
[2:51:10.220 --> 2:51:10.900]  That's the right point.
[2:51:10.900 --> 2:51:12.700]  It shows the school's really the parent.
[2:51:12.700 --> 2:51:14.900]  The children are wearing it, even when the parents aren't.
[2:51:14.900 --> 2:51:17.540]  Exactly, and I was out just the other day,
[2:51:17.540 --> 2:51:18.780]  and I saw a little girl.
[2:51:18.780 --> 2:51:20.460]  She was probably four or five years old,
[2:51:20.460 --> 2:51:23.460]  and she was wearing a mask, and she was happy as can be.
[2:51:23.460 --> 2:51:25.340]  And the parents didn't have a mask on.
[2:51:25.340 --> 2:51:28.060]  So it's not the household that's telling you
[2:51:28.060 --> 2:51:29.300]  what you should be doing.
[2:51:29.300 --> 2:51:31.020]  It's the school, because you have
[2:51:31.020 --> 2:51:33.180]  to understand that kid, your child,
[2:51:33.180 --> 2:51:37.060]  is going to be in the school for a prolonged period of time.
[2:51:37.060 --> 2:51:39.100]  And the teacher can do whatever they want.
[2:51:39.100 --> 2:51:40.860]  They can say, well, what a group of bad people
[2:51:40.860 --> 2:51:43.460]  to teach children they're dirty and bad and do this to them.
[2:51:43.460 --> 2:51:44.500]  To teach them, oh, you're dirty.
[2:51:44.500 --> 2:51:45.300]  You got to wear a mask.
[2:51:45.300 --> 2:51:46.860]  You're dirty because of what color you are.
[2:51:46.860 --> 2:51:48.540]  That is so damn abusive.
[2:51:48.540 --> 2:51:50.020]  And then when parents complain about it,
[2:51:50.020 --> 2:51:52.260]  they send the FBI after them.
[2:51:52.260 --> 2:51:54.700]  I mean, this is like cartoon level.
[2:51:54.700 --> 2:51:58.340]  And it's just to keep control.
[2:51:58.340 --> 2:52:00.940]  The schools are going to be part of the government,
[2:52:00.940 --> 2:52:02.660]  and the government needs to be protected.
[2:52:02.660 --> 2:52:06.260]  Because what the government doesn't want people to know
[2:52:06.260 --> 2:52:09.820]  is that the people have the power, not the government.
[2:52:09.820 --> 2:52:13.900]  So when people start to get power,
[2:52:13.900 --> 2:52:17.740]  when someone starts to rise in a level of power
[2:52:17.740 --> 2:52:19.780]  and the word starts to get out there,
[2:52:19.780 --> 2:52:21.860]  now all of a sudden the government is like, well,
[2:52:21.860 --> 2:52:22.980]  we need to stop you.
[2:52:22.980 --> 2:52:27.060]  We need to say that you are wrong and that you're the enemy,
[2:52:27.060 --> 2:52:29.460]  and people need to be wary of what you're saying,
[2:52:29.460 --> 2:52:30.900]  because it's not true.
[2:52:30.900 --> 2:52:32.420]  But what we say is true, and you need
[2:52:32.420 --> 2:52:34.500]  to listen to people like us, because we're
[2:52:34.500 --> 2:52:37.140]  going to keep you safe, we're going to protect you.
[2:52:37.140 --> 2:52:37.980]  And so what's the answer?
[2:52:37.980 --> 2:52:40.580]  Rally around those, the system's going to shut down.
[2:52:40.580 --> 2:52:44.020]  So the answer is going to be making sure
[2:52:44.020 --> 2:52:45.780]  you find like-minded people.
[2:52:45.780 --> 2:52:47.940]  And you want to understand where you want to be in life,
[2:52:47.940 --> 2:52:51.020]  because for people who don't understand where they want to be,
[2:52:51.020 --> 2:52:54.140]  then they're just going to keep on living life wherever
[2:52:54.140 --> 2:52:56.900]  the hurt is taking them.
[2:52:56.900 --> 2:52:58.780]  So they might not necessarily reach
[2:52:58.780 --> 2:53:01.460]  your most desired place in life, but they are just
[2:53:01.460 --> 2:53:03.740]  going to go where society goes.
[2:53:03.740 --> 2:53:06.140]  And typically, that's going to be downhill.
[2:53:06.140 --> 2:53:09.860]  So if you are a middle class person, for example,
[2:53:09.860 --> 2:53:13.700]  pay attention to how life was 10 to 20 years ago for you.
[2:53:13.700 --> 2:53:16.780]  And if life was better for you 10 to 20 years ago,
[2:53:16.780 --> 2:53:18.860]  then you should have some type of inclination
[2:53:18.860 --> 2:53:20.380]  that you're going in the wrong direction.
[2:53:20.380 --> 2:53:22.180]  But let's be clear, things are so negative now,
[2:53:22.180 --> 2:53:24.340]  even if you've got money, it's going downhill.
[2:53:24.340 --> 2:53:26.100]  I mean, Klaus Schwab says they're collapsing and all.
[2:53:26.100 --> 2:53:28.060]  How do they think they're going to get out of it?
[2:53:28.060 --> 2:53:30.420]  Why do the communists, the Nazis,
[2:53:30.420 --> 2:53:32.980]  why do they always want to make other people have nothing?
[2:53:32.980 --> 2:53:34.020]  I guess that makes them feel better,
[2:53:34.020 --> 2:53:35.340]  but they bring themselves down.
[2:53:35.340 --> 2:53:36.980]  Right, it's a restructuring.
[2:53:36.980 --> 2:53:40.100]  So they're being very meticulous in who
[2:53:40.100 --> 2:53:41.820]  is going to take power.
[2:53:41.820 --> 2:53:45.820]  And I was thinking about that past week now.
[2:53:45.820 --> 2:53:47.460]  Who is going to be next in power?
[2:53:47.460 --> 2:53:50.500]  Right, what is going to be the next steps?
[2:53:50.500 --> 2:53:52.340]  When is the collapse going to happen?
[2:53:52.340 --> 2:53:54.980]  And I have a number.
[2:53:54.980 --> 2:53:56.020]  I have a date.
[2:53:56.020 --> 2:53:58.580]  But it's all just speculation at this point.
[2:53:58.580 --> 2:54:01.180]  Now, but tell me your view.
[2:54:01.180 --> 2:54:04.500]  So I'm giving it a year and a half
[2:54:04.500 --> 2:54:06.900]  before people say enough is enough.
[2:54:06.900 --> 2:54:07.400]  I agree.
[2:54:07.400 --> 2:54:09.580]  They're going to try to crash it once the Republicans get
[2:54:09.580 --> 2:54:11.700]  in their own majority to blame them,
[2:54:11.700 --> 2:54:12.980]  as well as thinking this morning.
[2:54:12.980 --> 2:54:15.820]  Right, and they can do it in a few ways, right?
[2:54:15.820 --> 2:54:18.580]  So Joe Biden, of course, see now.
[2:54:18.580 --> 2:54:21.140]  And by the way, you did a great job in the last hour,
[2:54:21.140 --> 2:54:22.540]  but now you're being the Mike Reardon.
[2:54:22.540 --> 2:54:24.180]  You're really going to start telling us what's going on.
[2:54:24.180 --> 2:54:25.300]  This guy, I love this guy, man.
[2:54:25.300 --> 2:54:26.540]  I'm telling you, it'd be a huge talk show
[2:54:26.540 --> 2:54:27.540]  if we could get him on air.
[2:54:27.540 --> 2:54:29.060]  To start telling folks what's coming, Mike.
[2:54:29.060 --> 2:54:33.460]  So Joe Biden and Puppets, he is going
[2:54:33.460 --> 2:54:38.220]  to be taken out of the position of power of presidency.
[2:54:38.220 --> 2:54:40.660]  And Henry Ford, he talked about, I believe,
[2:54:40.660 --> 2:54:43.260]  in the 80s, or sometime.
[2:54:43.260 --> 2:54:46.620]  He said that the way a woman would become president
[2:54:46.620 --> 2:54:49.180]  is by assassination.
[2:54:49.180 --> 2:54:50.620]  I don't think they're going to do that.
[2:54:50.620 --> 2:54:52.060]  I think they're going to still love Joe.
[2:54:52.060 --> 2:54:54.060]  Joe's just going to say, hey, I just
[2:54:54.060 --> 2:54:57.580]  want to hang out with my wife and take it easy.
[2:54:57.580 --> 2:55:01.900]  And Camilla's going to come in, and she's going to take over.
[2:55:01.900 --> 2:55:04.780]  And what needs to happen is that we
[2:55:04.780 --> 2:55:08.300]  need to understand that that's the first step of them
[2:55:08.300 --> 2:55:09.820]  making their next move.
[2:55:09.820 --> 2:55:12.420]  And we can't make them, and we can't let them take any more
[2:55:12.420 --> 2:55:14.620]  moves after that, because if we do,
[2:55:14.620 --> 2:55:16.820]  they're going to keep that ball rolling,
[2:55:16.820 --> 2:55:20.020]  and they're going to take over the elections again.
[2:55:20.020 --> 2:55:23.140]  They're going to make a new variant right before the elections.
[2:55:23.140 --> 2:55:25.420]  And then all of a sudden, there's going to be mail out ballots
[2:55:25.420 --> 2:55:28.300]  again, and your voice is not going to matter,
[2:55:28.300 --> 2:55:29.740]  because they're going to say, well, we
[2:55:29.740 --> 2:55:32.740]  can make as many votes as we want for Camilla Harris,
[2:55:32.740 --> 2:55:34.900]  or whoever they choose to be the next one.
[2:55:34.900 --> 2:55:36.460]  And then again, we're not thinking it's women,
[2:55:36.460 --> 2:55:39.180]  but why do they obsess over putting women in power?
[2:55:39.180 --> 2:55:41.380]  Is it because it just historically destabilizes
[2:55:41.380 --> 2:55:43.460]  this thing, or do women think that there's somehow
[2:55:43.460 --> 2:55:44.620]  to fight with men?
[2:55:44.620 --> 2:55:47.580]  Well, think about the whole feminist movement right now.
[2:55:47.580 --> 2:55:50.580]  If you go on YouTube, most likely your home
[2:55:50.580 --> 2:55:54.220]  feeds could have some type of feminist person talking.
[2:55:54.220 --> 2:55:58.100]  And it's just a way for you to become acclimated
[2:55:58.100 --> 2:55:59.780]  to that type of environment.
[2:55:59.780 --> 2:56:00.500]  So the feminine.
[2:56:00.500 --> 2:56:02.260]  Every video game, every movie, the women
[2:56:02.260 --> 2:56:04.300]  of the heroes, the men are bad.
[2:56:04.300 --> 2:56:06.340]  Since Mary was killed 30 years ago.
[2:56:06.340 --> 2:56:08.820]  And right now, they're just making it forward,
[2:56:08.820 --> 2:56:11.700]  because it's easier for the brain to accept, well,
[2:56:11.700 --> 2:56:12.820]  it makes sense.
[2:56:12.820 --> 2:56:17.380]  And it's important for us, or for them to make sure people
[2:56:17.380 --> 2:56:19.540]  are operating under, well, that makes sense.
[2:56:19.540 --> 2:56:20.780]  It's only logical.
[2:56:20.780 --> 2:56:23.580]  And if it's a logical step for those type of people,
[2:56:23.580 --> 2:56:24.740]  they're not going to question.
[2:56:24.740 --> 2:56:28.260]  They're not going to fight back.
[2:56:28.260 --> 2:56:29.700]  But again, there are a lot of women
[2:56:29.700 --> 2:56:31.020]  that are smart and would be great leaders.
[2:56:31.020 --> 2:56:32.540]  The ones they're putting forward,
[2:56:32.540 --> 2:56:34.900]  what is the obsession with putting women in charge
[2:56:34.900 --> 2:56:37.460]  when they're not really in charge of their puppets?
[2:56:37.460 --> 2:56:40.260]  It's because they find the people they can control.
[2:56:40.260 --> 2:56:42.380]  They're not looking for people who are powerful.
[2:56:42.380 --> 2:56:44.340]  They're looking for people they can control.
[2:56:44.340 --> 2:56:44.820]  And for us.
[2:56:44.820 --> 2:56:45.340]  Well, so simple.
[2:56:45.340 --> 2:56:47.420]  When the Romans would take over an area in Germany
[2:56:47.420 --> 2:56:50.060]  or wherever, they would kill all the men down to age 10
[2:56:50.060 --> 2:56:51.980]  and keep the women, because the women would submit.
[2:56:51.980 --> 2:56:54.180]  That's just a biological fact.
[2:56:54.180 --> 2:56:59.220]  And then now we have feminists who want to be in power.
[2:56:59.220 --> 2:57:01.860]  And they'll do whatever it takes in order
[2:57:01.860 --> 2:57:03.700]  to be in that type of position.
[2:57:03.700 --> 2:57:10.220]  So if they have to give up their dreams, their livelihoods,
[2:57:10.220 --> 2:57:13.620]  they would, because they're going to be at a higher power.
[2:57:13.620 --> 2:57:15.940]  A feminist wants to be equal to a man.
[2:57:15.940 --> 2:57:18.740]  But if you really dig down deep, what do they want?
[2:57:18.740 --> 2:57:21.700]  They want to be greater than man.
[2:57:21.700 --> 2:57:24.740]  And look at Hillary Clinton's, the beta test of that.
[2:57:24.740 --> 2:57:28.220]  And so she wants to be front and center.
[2:57:28.220 --> 2:57:30.020]  I'm powerful.
[2:57:30.020 --> 2:57:31.340]  Pay attention.
[2:57:31.340 --> 2:57:36.300]  And for the people who can't see that that's happening,
[2:57:36.300 --> 2:57:42.060]  then they just have to start to see what type of things
[2:57:42.060 --> 2:57:43.740]  are popping up on their YouTube for example.
[2:57:43.740 --> 2:57:45.780]  Right there, we'll come right back with my whole ridden.
[2:57:45.780 --> 2:57:46.980]  So this could be.
[2:57:46.980 --> 2:57:49.500]  We have developed the research and the tools
[2:57:49.500 --> 2:57:51.860]  to stop this evil and to break free from it
[2:57:51.860 --> 2:57:53.580]  and to help others to break free from it.
[2:57:53.580 --> 2:57:56.180]  That's why we've launched Reset Wars.
[2:57:56.180 --> 2:57:59.060]  Once you simply accept that there is an incredibly evil group
[2:57:59.060 --> 2:58:01.820]  of people in the world that are attempting the great reset
[2:58:01.820 --> 2:58:04.580]  and want a one world corporate government,
[2:58:04.580 --> 2:58:06.580]  then you can learn how to defeat them
[2:58:06.580 --> 2:58:09.100]  by learning their war game strategies
[2:58:09.100 --> 2:58:11.620]  and how to not play the game.
[2:58:11.620 --> 2:58:14.900]  After decades of intense research,
[2:58:14.900 --> 2:58:17.900]  our quest to discover the key to breaking the globalist
[2:58:17.900 --> 2:58:20.580]  bonds is now life.
[2:58:20.580 --> 2:58:23.460]  The Reset Wars have begun.
[2:58:23.460 --> 2:58:27.420]  Start your journey at resetwars.com today.
[2:58:27.420 --> 2:58:30.260]  Your programming are very subconscious in our psyche
[2:58:30.260 --> 2:58:34.140]  to create these false constructs that they then control.
[2:58:34.140 --> 2:58:35.860]  We're going to lay out how that works.
[2:58:35.860 --> 2:58:38.740]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins
[2:58:38.740 --> 2:58:40.420]  at resetwars.com.
[2:58:40.420 --> 2:58:41.420]  Please join me there.
[2:58:41.420 --> 2:58:48.420]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[2:58:48.420 --> 2:58:50.420]  Let's talk to Malcolm in Tennessee.
[2:58:50.420 --> 2:58:50.860]  Welcome.
[2:58:50.860 --> 2:58:51.580]  Hello, Alex.
[2:58:51.580 --> 2:58:52.180]  Yes, Malcolm.
[2:58:52.180 --> 2:58:54.580]  All right, I will make this quick and real short
[2:58:54.580 --> 2:58:56.580]  where the other patrons can get on the line.
[2:58:56.580 --> 2:58:59.100]  Alex, I have to promote one thing from one
[2:58:59.100 --> 2:59:00.980]  of your co-hosts, Owen Shroyer.
[2:59:00.980 --> 2:59:04.020]  Supermail volatility and brain force plus.
[2:59:04.020 --> 2:59:05.340]  Mix those two together.
[2:59:05.340 --> 2:59:06.860]  You're an unstoppable tank.
[2:59:06.860 --> 2:59:08.700]  Supermail volatility really, really works.
[2:59:08.700 --> 2:59:11.940]  It's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds
[2:59:11.940 --> 2:59:13.580]  that have never been heated up.
[2:59:13.580 --> 2:59:18.140]  And so it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions.
[2:59:18.140 --> 2:59:20.420]  It also worked quite well, but just aren't as strong.
[2:59:20.420 --> 2:59:23.060]  This is like a very fine wine.
[2:59:23.060 --> 2:59:24.300]  In fact, each batch is different.
[2:59:24.300 --> 2:59:25.620]  Sometimes it's super strong.
[2:59:25.620 --> 2:59:26.780]  Sometimes it's just OK.
[2:59:26.780 --> 2:59:28.180]  People are like, why are you selling something
[2:59:28.180 --> 2:59:30.100]  and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong?
[2:59:30.100 --> 2:59:31.020]  That's just how it is.
[2:59:31.020 --> 2:59:32.580]  It's how it works.
[2:59:32.580 --> 2:59:34.300]  So it's always good.
[2:59:34.300 --> 2:59:36.420]  It's just sometimes it's like super strong.
[2:59:36.420 --> 2:59:39.460]  But yeah, if you want the Rolls Royce at a decent price,
[2:59:39.460 --> 2:59:40.300]  then this is it.
[2:59:48.300 --> 2:59:52.860]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order,
[2:59:52.860 --> 2:59:54.140]  it's Alex Jones.
[3:00:00.300 --> 3:00:02.340]  RevanConcepts.com.
[3:00:02.340 --> 3:00:04.820]  R-E-V-E-N Concepts.com.
[3:00:04.820 --> 3:00:05.740]  Michael Reardon.
[3:00:05.740 --> 3:00:08.140]  All right, you've got to come back again soon, my friend,
[3:00:08.140 --> 3:00:10.060]  because you're just starting to get going here with people.
[3:00:10.060 --> 3:00:12.220]  But you wanted to talk about Joe Rogan in the break.
[3:00:12.220 --> 3:00:13.420]  You said you had a Joe Rogan story.
[3:00:13.420 --> 3:00:14.700]  I want to say something about that.
[3:00:14.700 --> 3:00:18.460]  Yes, so Joe Rogan talked about this as saying it's a quote
[3:00:18.460 --> 3:00:23.420]  that many people might be familiar with is that,
[3:00:23.420 --> 3:00:24.980]  tough times create strong men.
[3:00:24.980 --> 3:00:27.180]  Strong men create easy times.
[3:00:27.180 --> 3:00:29.300]  Easy times create weak men.
[3:00:29.300 --> 3:00:31.140]  And weak men create tough times.
[3:00:31.140 --> 3:00:33.180]  And that's the cycle we're in right now,
[3:00:33.180 --> 3:00:36.180]  where the government understands that cycle very well.
[3:00:36.180 --> 3:00:39.220]  If we can keep them weak, if we can keep them needy,
[3:00:39.220 --> 3:00:43.060]  then we can make them do whatever we need them to do.
[3:00:43.060 --> 3:00:47.220]  So for example, beginning of the lockdowns,
[3:00:47.220 --> 3:00:49.900]  we're going to give people an extra $300
[3:00:49.900 --> 3:00:51.980]  because they need that type of money
[3:00:51.980 --> 3:00:53.220]  because they're not working.
[3:00:53.220 --> 3:00:55.380]  They make you in the position of subservient.
[3:00:55.380 --> 3:00:59.220]  They keep you weak because we had easy times, right?
[3:00:59.220 --> 3:01:01.580]  So we had our fathers and our ancestors.
[3:01:01.580 --> 3:01:02.980]  They were strong men.
[3:01:02.980 --> 3:01:05.340]  And then they gave us easy times.
[3:01:05.340 --> 3:01:07.420]  They said, well, I don't want my child
[3:01:07.420 --> 3:01:08.940]  to go through these types of challenges
[3:01:08.940 --> 3:01:10.780]  that I went through in my life.
[3:01:10.780 --> 3:01:13.300]  So they say, I'm going to create easier times.
[3:01:13.300 --> 3:01:15.060]  And the government caught on.
[3:01:15.060 --> 3:01:18.300]  And they said, well, let's just keep easy times going.
[3:01:18.300 --> 3:01:21.020]  And then we can make those people do whatever we need them
[3:01:21.020 --> 3:01:21.300]  to do.
[3:01:21.300 --> 3:01:22.220]  We can control them.
[3:01:22.220 --> 3:01:24.260]  We can say, well, in order for you
[3:01:24.260 --> 3:01:28.820]  to get your 401Ks, you need to make sure you're fully vaccinated.
[3:01:28.820 --> 3:01:30.620]  You need to show a passport.
[3:01:30.620 --> 3:01:36.180]  In order for you to come in and enjoy a night out,
[3:01:36.180 --> 3:01:39.780]  you need to show some type of proof of vaccination, right?
[3:01:39.780 --> 3:01:42.780]  So they're literally saying what we can and what we can do.
[3:01:42.780 --> 3:01:46.300]  And for the people who are operating under that weak type
[3:01:46.300 --> 3:01:49.380]  of mentality, they're going to say, well, I guess I'll
[3:01:49.380 --> 3:01:50.420]  have a choice.
[3:01:50.420 --> 3:01:53.340]  And the fact that they believe that they don't have a choice
[3:01:53.340 --> 3:01:57.300]  is proof enough that they are operating under a fixed type
[3:01:57.300 --> 3:01:57.860]  of mindset.
[3:01:57.860 --> 3:02:00.620]  And that's going to be one that doesn't operate under growth.
[3:02:00.620 --> 3:02:04.460]  It's going to operate under circumstance.
[3:02:04.460 --> 3:02:06.900]  And I love your mindset.
[3:02:06.900 --> 3:02:08.540]  There's so many different schools of thought.
[3:02:08.540 --> 3:02:09.540]  I like Carl Young.
[3:02:09.540 --> 3:02:10.900]  Obviously, I follow Jesus Christ.
[3:02:10.900 --> 3:02:15.540]  But I'd say the mindset of the real world, of street smarts,
[3:02:15.540 --> 3:02:18.380]  of just how it really works, the real politic of that,
[3:02:18.380 --> 3:02:21.740]  and stop being a fool and just thinking, the system loves me.
[3:02:21.740 --> 3:02:22.620]  It's going to take care of me.
[3:02:22.620 --> 3:02:24.540]  That's just a lie.
[3:02:24.540 --> 3:02:27.500]  And we have to elevate ourself.
[3:02:27.500 --> 3:02:31.020]  We have to become leaders more so than followers.
[3:02:31.020 --> 3:02:34.940]  And I love what you do with info wars.
[3:02:34.940 --> 3:02:37.140]  You are info warriors.
[3:02:37.140 --> 3:02:39.180]  We're creating info warriors.
[3:02:39.180 --> 3:02:43.420]  And what Reset Wars is doing is creating info leaders.
[3:02:43.420 --> 3:02:47.860]  They're now trying to stop Reset Wars.
[3:02:47.860 --> 3:02:50.420]  And there's a reason why they're trying to stop Reset Wars
[3:02:50.420 --> 3:02:53.180]  is because they understand that that type of workshop, that
[3:02:53.180 --> 3:02:56.820]  type of class, is going to create new leaders of the world.
[3:02:56.820 --> 3:02:59.700]  And to have powerful people come up
[3:02:59.700 --> 3:03:02.620]  and to say, enough's enough, they
[3:03:02.620 --> 3:03:04.140]  don't want that type of fight because they
[3:03:04.140 --> 3:03:05.420]  know they're going to lose.
[3:03:05.420 --> 3:03:08.140]  And I was talking to you, I believe a week or two ago,
[3:03:08.140 --> 3:03:10.020]  I told you, don't stop.
[3:03:10.020 --> 3:03:11.580]  Don't stop.
[3:03:11.580 --> 3:03:15.420]  And as much as they push, as much as they want you to quit,
[3:03:15.420 --> 3:03:19.220]  they do everything in their power to make you feel like,
[3:03:19.220 --> 3:03:20.740]  maybe I should stop.
[3:03:20.740 --> 3:03:21.820]  Don't stop.
[3:03:21.820 --> 3:03:22.500]  Well, I'm not.
[3:03:22.500 --> 3:03:24.580]  But we were having a hard, hard conversation about that
[3:03:24.580 --> 3:03:26.620]  because I worry about my family, but they're
[3:03:26.620 --> 3:03:28.780]  going to get destroyed anyways if this thing succeeds.
[3:03:28.780 --> 3:03:29.900]  So we just got to be all in.
[3:03:29.900 --> 3:03:31.420]  Do the right thing, trusting God.
[3:03:31.420 --> 3:03:33.580]  Exactly.
[3:03:33.580 --> 3:03:36.740]  Well, Reset Wars, it's historical how
[3:03:36.740 --> 3:03:39.580]  they know that they can create these false images of ourselves
[3:03:39.580 --> 3:03:40.340]  that are losers.
[3:03:40.340 --> 3:03:41.620]  That's not who we are.
[3:03:41.620 --> 3:03:44.780]  So just the idea that I'm not that loser, that's so powerful.
[3:03:44.780 --> 3:03:46.860]  And I'm surprised that they, out of the gates,
[3:03:46.860 --> 3:03:47.740]  try to block it.
[3:03:47.740 --> 3:03:49.940]  But they are really worried about us empowering people
[3:03:49.940 --> 3:03:51.620]  and us saying, hey, you're amazing.
[3:03:51.620 --> 3:03:52.540]  You're incredible.
[3:03:52.540 --> 3:03:53.860]  You made the image of God.
[3:03:53.860 --> 3:03:56.220]  Because they understand the influence
[3:03:56.220 --> 3:03:58.540]  that comes behind being positive.
[3:03:58.540 --> 3:04:01.380]  So the brain is naturally negative.
[3:04:01.380 --> 3:04:03.660]  And in order to counteract the negative,
[3:04:03.660 --> 3:04:05.220]  you need three positives.
[3:04:05.220 --> 3:04:06.900]  So the fact that you're giving people
[3:04:06.900 --> 3:04:08.860]  what they need in order to change,
[3:04:08.860 --> 3:04:10.460]  they don't want that to happen.
[3:04:10.460 --> 3:04:12.180]  So now you have Reset Wars, and you're
[3:04:12.180 --> 3:04:13.940]  talking about positive, positive, positive.
[3:04:13.940 --> 3:04:15.660]  Well, that's exactly because this show is negative.
[3:04:15.660 --> 3:04:17.180]  I don't know what's bad, so they don't do it.
[3:04:17.180 --> 3:04:18.780]  But I tried to make it all positive.
[3:04:18.780 --> 3:04:19.940]  They really don't like that.
[3:04:19.940 --> 3:04:20.500]  Correct.
[3:04:20.500 --> 3:04:21.900]  Because now you told about a month ago,
[3:04:21.900 --> 3:04:24.060]  you said, I think you're going to get some issues with being
[3:04:24.060 --> 3:04:24.780]  all positive.
[3:04:24.780 --> 3:04:25.500]  That's what it is.
[3:04:25.500 --> 3:04:28.300]  Right, because now you're starting to balance out.
[3:04:28.300 --> 3:04:29.820]  And that's why your credibility,
[3:04:29.820 --> 3:04:31.460]  that's why your audience is growing.
[3:04:31.460 --> 3:04:35.020]  It's because now people are like, wow, it's making sense now.
[3:04:35.020 --> 3:04:37.380]  Because it's not just one side.
[3:04:37.380 --> 3:04:40.140]  Because if you're on one side, then, of course, the other side,
[3:04:40.140 --> 3:04:41.660]  it's like you're my enemy.
[3:04:41.660 --> 3:04:46.460]  But now that you are saying, hey, I'm on both sides,
[3:04:46.460 --> 3:04:47.540]  I want you to be better.
[3:04:47.540 --> 3:04:49.260]  I want everybody, not exactly.
[3:04:49.260 --> 3:04:50.420]  RevanConcepts.com.
[3:04:50.420 --> 3:04:52.540]  Michael Reardon, thank you so much for an amazing job.
[3:04:52.540 --> 3:04:54.980]  All right, thank you.
[3:04:54.980 --> 3:04:56.540]  Everything I do.
[3:04:56.540 --> 3:04:59.420]  It's time to protect your privacy.
[3:04:59.420 --> 3:05:01.780]  It's time to come to grips with the fact
[3:05:01.780 --> 3:05:03.780]  that even though you don't have anything to hide,
[3:05:03.780 --> 3:05:07.660]  criminals, hackers, corporations, big tech government
[3:05:07.660 --> 3:05:10.220]  are stealing all of your data and creating
[3:05:10.220 --> 3:05:13.420]  a map and a database of where you go and what you do.
[3:05:13.420 --> 3:05:16.020]  So in the future, under their globalist takeover,
[3:05:16.020 --> 3:05:17.820]  they can shut you down.
[3:05:17.820 --> 3:05:21.020]  Protecting your privacy, protecting your credit cards,
[3:05:21.020 --> 3:05:23.500]  protecting your bank accounts, protecting your photos,
[3:05:23.500 --> 3:05:26.780]  protecting everything that's on your phone is paramount.
[3:05:26.780 --> 3:05:29.460]  That's why everybody should visit infowarstore.com.

[3:05:57.580 --> 3:06:02.900]  MUSIC
[3:06:02.900 --> 3:06:09.160]  J Dyer, my favorite talk show host, is about to take over here.
[3:06:09.160 --> 3:06:13.300]  Ladies and gentlemen, and tomorrow I'm gonna come in here
[3:06:13.300 --> 3:06:15.600]  like 11 AM and I'm gonna interview Roger Stone
[3:06:15.600 --> 3:06:18.280]  about what happened to January 6th to May today.
[3:06:18.280 --> 3:06:21.540]  I'm gonna interview a Dr. Marbel.
[3:06:21.540 --> 3:06:24.300]  I'm gonna interview a bunch of other special guests tomorrow
[3:06:24.300 --> 3:06:26.020]  and it should be done by 4 p.m.
[3:06:26.020 --> 3:06:29.260]  because I'm gonna start taping like noon, three hours.
[3:06:29.260 --> 3:06:30.940]  So let's just say 5 p.m. tomorrow.
[3:06:30.940 --> 3:06:35.820]  We'll post the Saturday emergency transmission.
[3:06:35.820 --> 3:06:37.280]  That way we got plenty of time to put it out.
[3:06:37.280 --> 3:06:38.400]  But look for that.
[3:06:38.400 --> 3:06:39.700]  Because every day's precious.
[3:06:39.700 --> 3:06:42.020]  Every day we're on air is amazing.
[3:06:42.020 --> 3:06:43.920]  Every day on air is so incredible.
[3:06:43.920 --> 3:06:45.700]  I mean, look at these headlines on a news week.
[3:06:45.700 --> 3:06:47.740]  People get microchips implanted
[3:06:47.740 --> 3:06:49.540]  that include vaccine records
[3:06:49.540 --> 3:06:51.100]  amid new COVID restrictions.
[3:06:52.580 --> 3:06:54.940]  Clashwap said five years ago,
[3:06:54.940 --> 3:06:58.060]  by the year 2025 you will take microchips to buy and sell.
[3:06:59.460 --> 3:07:00.300]  Here we are.
[3:07:01.540 --> 3:07:05.940]  CDC data, fentanyl overdose now kills more Americans
[3:07:05.940 --> 3:07:09.620]  than COVID cancer and car accidents and suicide combined.
[3:07:10.660 --> 3:07:13.900]  They don't care about that because they want you dead.
[3:07:13.900 --> 3:07:16.220]  Unbelievable information.
[3:07:16.220 --> 3:07:20.340]  But yeah, the system is definitely scared to reset wars
[3:07:20.340 --> 3:07:22.580]  because it's always shown as being nothing but positive
[3:07:22.580 --> 3:07:23.980]  and talking about how powerful you are
[3:07:23.980 --> 3:07:27.020]  and talking about innate science of quantum mechanics
[3:07:27.020 --> 3:07:30.380]  and physics that shows you are not just existing
[3:07:30.380 --> 3:07:31.700]  in the third dimension.
[3:07:31.700 --> 3:07:33.940]  I mean, my gosh, an hour of this is powerful.
[3:07:33.940 --> 3:07:36.120]  This is almost seven hours.
[3:07:36.120 --> 3:07:39.540]  And yes, we're doing it 25% off extended through Christmas
[3:07:39.540 --> 3:07:40.540]  because I want everybody to get it.
[3:07:40.540 --> 3:07:41.900]  So please support the broadcast
[3:07:41.900 --> 3:07:43.500]  to get this powerful information.
[3:07:43.500 --> 3:07:45.540]  What you see on screen is the promo.
[3:07:45.540 --> 3:07:46.780]  That's not the actual course.
[3:07:46.780 --> 3:07:48.820]  That's me, but they're talking about the course
[3:07:48.820 --> 3:07:50.940]  at resetwars.com.
[3:07:50.940 --> 3:07:54.500]  Jay Dyer takes over, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:07:54.500 --> 3:07:58.020]  author, researcher, expert on the globalist operations.
[3:07:58.020 --> 3:07:58.980]  So much to talk about.
[3:07:58.980 --> 3:08:00.020]  Can't wait to listen to him.
[3:08:00.020 --> 3:08:01.180]  Jay, thank you so much.
[3:08:02.140 --> 3:08:03.740]  Absolutely, thank you.
[3:08:03.740 --> 3:08:06.540]  You were talking about learned helplessness
[3:08:06.540 --> 3:08:08.540]  all these years and I didn't even realize
[3:08:08.540 --> 3:08:11.020]  that that actually comes out of Abraham Maslow
[3:08:11.020 --> 3:08:12.980]  who worked in MKUltra.
[3:08:12.980 --> 3:08:13.940]  A lot of people don't know that,
[3:08:13.940 --> 3:08:16.500]  but I'm gonna talk about the history
[3:08:16.500 --> 3:08:18.340]  of the MKUltra projects, new research
[3:08:18.340 --> 3:08:20.900]  that I've uncovered in the last year.
[3:08:20.900 --> 3:08:23.060]  And that will fit well with reset wars
[3:08:23.060 --> 3:08:24.460]  and the whole idea of mind control.
[3:08:24.460 --> 3:08:26.960]  I'm gonna show how the MKUltra projects,
[3:08:26.960 --> 3:08:28.880]  mind control out of the 40s and 50s,
[3:08:28.880 --> 3:08:31.860]  how it actually leads us into transhumanism.
[3:08:31.860 --> 3:08:32.700]  A lot of people don't know
[3:08:32.700 --> 3:08:35.340]  that the history of MKUltra is really about
[3:08:35.340 --> 3:08:38.180]  biometrics and the mutation of man.
[3:08:38.180 --> 3:08:39.900]  This actually comes up in the
[3:08:39.900 --> 3:08:43.420]  Julian Huxley philosophy of UNESCO essay that he wrote
[3:08:43.420 --> 3:08:44.260]  where he talks about how,
[3:08:44.260 --> 3:08:46.540]  well, we can't really talk about eugenics anymore.
[3:08:46.540 --> 3:08:48.220]  Let's just rephrase this,
[3:08:48.220 --> 3:08:52.740]  return it as biometrics and that's exactly what happened.
[3:08:52.740 --> 3:08:54.060]  So let's get into some of the history
[3:08:54.060 --> 3:08:55.740]  of the mind control projects
[3:08:55.740 --> 3:08:59.540]  and where they came from and what they led to.
[3:08:59.540 --> 3:09:02.180]  I'm gonna go through some of the declassified projects
[3:09:02.180 --> 3:09:03.900]  and what they were actually about.
[3:09:03.900 --> 3:09:05.220]  And this is really just a snippet.
[3:09:05.220 --> 3:09:07.380]  These are just some of the projects that we know about.
[3:09:07.380 --> 3:09:09.980]  A lot of the documents were destroyed
[3:09:09.980 --> 3:09:13.100]  by the CIA director when he knew they were gonna be
[3:09:13.100 --> 3:09:15.620]  undergoing congressional scrutiny.
[3:09:15.620 --> 3:09:18.380]  But what has come out and what certain court cases
[3:09:18.380 --> 3:09:21.540]  have determined based on people who were in these projects,
[3:09:21.540 --> 3:09:23.260]  suing the government and whatnot,
[3:09:23.260 --> 3:09:25.780]  there's a famous clip of Bill Clinton many years ago.
[3:09:25.780 --> 3:09:27.020]  If you've seen this,
[3:09:27.020 --> 3:09:30.500]  oh, I'd like to apologize for what we did
[3:09:30.500 --> 3:09:32.820]  to the American people and MKUltra of the government.
[3:09:32.820 --> 3:09:34.800]  He admits this, it was a famous clip.
[3:09:36.340 --> 3:09:40.380]  Now the first project I wanna mention is Subproject 68.
[3:09:40.380 --> 3:09:43.060]  And this is Dr. Ewan Cameron out of Mount Royale
[3:09:43.060 --> 3:09:46.820]  in Canada, he was a doctor who pioneered this idea
[3:09:46.820 --> 3:09:50.180]  of imprinting and training and deep patterning.
[3:09:50.180 --> 3:09:52.900]  And so what he would do is he would try to white people's
[3:09:52.900 --> 3:09:55.340]  minds like a blank slate and experiment
[3:09:55.340 --> 3:09:57.100]  that at a mental institute,
[3:09:57.100 --> 3:09:58.940]  when you think of all the movies that you've seen
[3:09:58.940 --> 3:10:01.100]  with the archetypal mad scientist doctor
[3:10:01.100 --> 3:10:02.860]  at the mental institute, the horror movies
[3:10:02.860 --> 3:10:04.940]  that are trying to micro-control people,
[3:10:04.940 --> 3:10:07.380]  this comes out of this idea with Dr. Ewan Cameron.
[3:10:07.380 --> 3:10:09.140]  And so he worked in sleep studies,
[3:10:09.140 --> 3:10:10.620]  he worked in deprivation studies,
[3:10:10.620 --> 3:10:14.220]  he worked with float tanks, pods, all this kind of stuff.
[3:10:14.220 --> 3:10:17.520]  And the idea of prolonged sensory isolation
[3:10:17.520 --> 3:10:20.420]  was part of his plan of deep patterning.
[3:10:20.420 --> 3:10:22.860]  The idea of being that if he could experiment
[3:10:22.860 --> 3:10:26.220]  on people that had problems with addictions or trauma,
[3:10:26.220 --> 3:10:28.340]  maybe he could reboot the whole mind,
[3:10:28.340 --> 3:10:30.340]  the whole system like a computer
[3:10:30.340 --> 3:10:33.900]  and just start over and kind of imprint a new pattern.
[3:10:33.900 --> 3:10:35.460]  Now, it was under the auspices of,
[3:10:35.460 --> 3:10:36.780]  oh, we're gonna help all these people
[3:10:36.780 --> 3:10:38.660]  that have had addictions and trauma,
[3:10:38.660 --> 3:10:40.660]  but you can begin to see how this could be used
[3:10:40.660 --> 3:10:42.580]  for nefarious purposes.
[3:10:42.580 --> 3:10:44.580]  If people can be mind-wiped
[3:10:44.580 --> 3:10:46.380]  and if they can have false memories implanted,
[3:10:46.380 --> 3:10:48.700]  if they can have a new identity implanted
[3:10:48.700 --> 3:10:52.180]  and a new imprinting of a new personality,
[3:10:52.180 --> 3:10:53.660]  then you could see how this could lead
[3:10:53.660 --> 3:10:56.660]  to all kinds of tyrannical results.
[3:10:56.660 --> 3:10:59.980]  He experimented with drugs and toxins as well,
[3:10:59.980 --> 3:11:03.460]  LSD, so forth, and there's a famous CBC,
[3:11:03.460 --> 3:11:05.860]  a Canadian documentary as many years ago
[3:11:05.860 --> 3:11:07.260]  that are still on YouTube available
[3:11:07.260 --> 3:11:11.100]  on this original project involving Dr. Cameron.
[3:11:12.260 --> 3:11:13.940]  This, I think, I don't have any proof of this,
[3:11:13.940 --> 3:11:16.060]  but the only proof I've uncovered about things
[3:11:16.060 --> 3:11:19.740]  like Alice in Wonderland having a relationship to MKUltra
[3:11:19.740 --> 3:11:21.780]  is that in one of the cases,
[3:11:21.780 --> 3:11:24.100]  Dr. Cameron did try to imprint a woman
[3:11:24.100 --> 3:11:26.740]  using the story of Alice in Wonderland.
[3:11:26.740 --> 3:11:29.380]  So that might be the source of this idea
[3:11:29.380 --> 3:11:30.220]  that there's some connection
[3:11:30.220 --> 3:11:33.540]  between the story of Alice in Wonderland and MKUltra.
[3:11:33.540 --> 3:11:35.220]  And if you've read Alice in Wonderland,
[3:11:35.220 --> 3:11:36.900]  which I actually did a video on recently,
[3:11:36.900 --> 3:11:39.780]  I went back and reread the book, the first one.
[3:11:39.780 --> 3:11:41.340]  And I don't know or have any evidence
[3:11:41.340 --> 3:11:43.740]  that Lewis Carroll himself was experimenting
[3:11:43.740 --> 3:11:46.620]  with these things, but there's a section in the story
[3:11:46.620 --> 3:11:49.180]  where Alice actually has multiple personalities
[3:11:49.180 --> 3:11:51.940]  and is discussing things with herself.
[3:11:51.940 --> 3:11:55.500]  The whole dialogue is really this sort of fantastical,
[3:11:55.500 --> 3:11:57.220]  almost drug trip type of fiction
[3:11:57.220 --> 3:12:01.140]  where Alice is going through different realities,
[3:12:01.140 --> 3:12:03.780]  multiverses, and talking to herself
[3:12:03.780 --> 3:12:05.180]  in terms of alternate personality.
[3:12:05.180 --> 3:12:09.420]  So that might be why it was chosen by Dr. Cameron.
[3:12:09.420 --> 3:12:12.260]  The next project I'll mention is Sub-Project Three.
[3:12:12.260 --> 3:12:14.860]  And this one is interesting because it's similar to
[3:12:14.860 --> 3:12:19.500]  and is renamed later Operation Midnight Climax.
[3:12:19.500 --> 3:12:22.220]  This is where the CIA went to organize crime
[3:12:22.220 --> 3:12:24.220]  and actually set up a situation
[3:12:24.220 --> 3:12:26.140]  where they would entrap different Johns
[3:12:26.140 --> 3:12:30.180]  in a house of ill repute and dose them with LSD.
[3:12:30.180 --> 3:12:33.180]  So they would spray the room or they would dose the drinks.
[3:12:33.180 --> 3:12:35.140]  And meanwhile, there was a two-way mirror
[3:12:35.140 --> 3:12:36.460]  and they were sitting there recording all this
[3:12:36.460 --> 3:12:37.820]  and watching and seeing what would happen.
[3:12:37.820 --> 3:12:39.860]  So number one, we have a connection between the CIA
[3:12:39.860 --> 3:12:41.700]  and organized crime, which I've detailed
[3:12:41.700 --> 3:12:43.100]  in many talks and videos.
[3:12:43.100 --> 3:12:45.460]  That's a well-known historical fact.
[3:12:45.460 --> 3:12:48.500]  In fact, Alex mentioned that this week in one of his shows.
[3:12:48.500 --> 3:12:50.180]  And this is a real thing, right?
[3:12:50.180 --> 3:12:52.700]  The Sicilian mafia helped the U.S.
[3:12:52.700 --> 3:12:54.660]  in different wartime scenarios.
[3:12:54.660 --> 3:12:56.540]  The organized crime syndicates,
[3:12:56.540 --> 3:12:57.860]  I've worked with intelligence agencies
[3:12:57.860 --> 3:12:59.780]  in terms of trafficking, drugs, and so forth.
[3:12:59.780 --> 3:13:02.740]  This is very well known, it's going on for many years.
[3:13:02.740 --> 3:13:05.420]  But here there was a connection between the CIA
[3:13:05.420 --> 3:13:07.740]  and these poor, unfortunate souls
[3:13:07.740 --> 3:13:10.420]  who had really bad trips when they went
[3:13:10.420 --> 3:13:13.060]  to visit their favorite ladies of the evening.
[3:13:14.220 --> 3:13:15.820]  And these are all real projects,
[3:13:15.820 --> 3:13:18.660]  all real, no longer discounted,
[3:13:18.660 --> 3:13:21.540]  they're no longer doubted, these are public record now.
[3:13:21.540 --> 3:13:24.220]  And these are only the ones that we know about.
[3:13:24.220 --> 3:13:26.660]  So here we have a sexual entrapment situation
[3:13:26.660 --> 3:13:29.940]  where they wanted to see what would happen
[3:13:29.940 --> 3:13:32.860]  in the midst of, again, midnight climax.
[3:13:32.860 --> 3:13:34.940]  In the midst of these John situations,
[3:13:34.940 --> 3:13:36.980]  what would happen to the guys
[3:13:36.980 --> 3:13:39.060]  who were unknowingly dosed by LSD?
[3:13:39.060 --> 3:13:40.380]  And if you know about LSD,
[3:13:40.380 --> 3:13:42.620]  that could be a very traumatizing thing.
[3:13:42.620 --> 3:13:44.900]  So again, many, many human rights violations,
[3:13:44.900 --> 3:13:46.780]  but I guess in the situation
[3:13:46.780 --> 3:13:48.180]  where you're doing something illegal,
[3:13:48.180 --> 3:13:50.140]  they can get away with it.
[3:13:50.140 --> 3:13:53.220]  And what came out in result of this operation
[3:13:53.220 --> 3:13:55.740]  of midnight climax was that at least what we knew
[3:13:55.740 --> 3:13:59.740]  of 20, 30 years ago, there were some 80 institutions
[3:13:59.740 --> 3:14:02.380]  involved in MKLTRA projects.
[3:14:02.380 --> 3:14:04.860]  I've recently uncovered information
[3:14:04.860 --> 3:14:07.060]  that connects it to Australia as well.
[3:14:07.060 --> 3:14:09.780]  So this is just institutions in North America,
[3:14:09.780 --> 3:14:10.820]  Canada and so forth.
[3:14:10.820 --> 3:14:13.660]  But actually MKLTRA was going on in many other countries.
[3:14:13.660 --> 3:14:14.900]  They were doing things in other countries
[3:14:14.900 --> 3:14:16.580]  that they could get away with,
[3:14:16.580 --> 3:14:19.660]  that they couldn't easily get away with in the US.
[3:14:19.660 --> 3:14:22.460]  And that's why you'll find a lot of doctors and PhDs.
[3:14:22.460 --> 3:14:23.820]  There was even one of the Huxley brothers
[3:14:23.820 --> 3:14:26.420]  was doing MKLTRA operations in Australia.
[3:14:26.420 --> 3:14:29.460]  He was actually heading up MKLTRA operations
[3:14:29.460 --> 3:14:34.460]  in Australia while Julian connected to Tavistock
[3:14:35.260 --> 3:14:37.820]  and doing these kinds of operations in the UK.
[3:14:37.820 --> 3:14:39.780]  Again, similar situations in the US.
[3:14:39.780 --> 3:14:43.460]  So this is actually a global worldwide experiment
[3:14:43.460 --> 3:14:47.100]  in many psychiatric, educational
[3:14:47.100 --> 3:14:49.300]  and social institutions across the globe.
[3:14:51.020 --> 3:14:53.660]  In other cases, we had Dr. James Hamilton
[3:14:53.660 --> 3:14:56.180]  at the Vacaville State Prison Facility.
[3:14:56.180 --> 3:14:57.780]  So if you didn't know, a lot of prisoners
[3:14:57.780 --> 3:14:59.740]  were brought into these projects,
[3:14:59.740 --> 3:15:01.220]  they were experimented on.
[3:15:01.220 --> 3:15:03.700]  This can lead us to situations like
[3:15:03.700 --> 3:15:05.140]  what we have with the Phoenix program
[3:15:05.140 --> 3:15:07.580]  where guys in Vietnam were experimented on.
[3:15:08.500 --> 3:15:11.180]  This involves soldiers out of Fort Bragg as well,
[3:15:11.180 --> 3:15:14.260]  Edward Arsenal, all part of the Vacaville type experiments
[3:15:14.260 --> 3:15:17.100]  where they were giving LSD to these prisoners,
[3:15:17.100 --> 3:15:20.380]  giving patterning, depatterning and re-imprinting
[3:15:20.380 --> 3:15:22.460]  experiments to see if they could reform prisoners.
[3:15:22.460 --> 3:15:25.060]  If you've seen Kubrick's Clockwork Orange,
[3:15:25.060 --> 3:15:26.380]  this is this kind of a program.
[3:15:26.380 --> 3:15:30.340]  Could we re-socialize and domesticate these guys
[3:15:30.340 --> 3:15:31.980]  back into normal society
[3:15:31.980 --> 3:15:34.060]  or perhaps turn them into assassins?
[3:15:34.060 --> 3:15:35.860]  And there's actually one of the programs
[3:15:35.860 --> 3:15:37.260]  during a minute, which we'll get to
[3:15:37.260 --> 3:15:38.180]  when we come back from this break
[3:15:38.180 --> 3:15:40.300]  that actually deals with the assassins.
[3:15:40.300 --> 3:15:41.740]  And this is probably what most people think of
[3:15:41.740 --> 3:15:43.580]  when they think of MKLTRA from the movies
[3:15:43.580 --> 3:15:44.740]  is the program to assassins.
[3:15:44.740 --> 3:15:47.420]  And that was just one of the many, many, many projects.
[3:15:47.420 --> 3:15:48.260]  Don't go anywhere.
[3:15:48.260 --> 3:15:50.660]  This is the Alex Jones show on your guest host, Jay Dyer.
[3:15:50.660 --> 3:15:55.420]  What if you...
[3:15:55.420 --> 3:15:59.020]  The CEO of Pfizer just came out and said that
[3:15:59.020 --> 3:16:01.300]  people talking bad about the vaccines
[3:16:01.300 --> 3:16:03.740]  are working for, quote, dark forces.
[3:16:03.740 --> 3:16:07.940]  The FBI and CIA have been advising him
[3:16:07.940 --> 3:16:11.180]  on who these evil groups are.
[3:16:11.180 --> 3:16:12.780]  They know that all over the world
[3:16:12.780 --> 3:16:16.020]  their poison shot is being banned by major governments.
[3:16:16.020 --> 3:16:18.180]  And Moderna's in trouble as well.
[3:16:18.180 --> 3:16:20.260]  They know that the people are starting
[3:16:20.260 --> 3:16:23.140]  to get wise this depopulation agenda.
[3:16:23.140 --> 3:16:25.100]  In fact, evidence is starting to mount
[3:16:25.100 --> 3:16:27.460]  that the shots were supposed to be soft-kill weapons,
[3:16:27.460 --> 3:16:29.860]  but they're so deadly they're killing
[3:16:29.860 --> 3:16:31.860]  a higher percentage upfront,
[3:16:31.860 --> 3:16:34.900]  and so people are waking up.
[3:16:34.900 --> 3:16:38.180]  The weapons work a little too good.
[3:16:38.180 --> 3:16:40.500]  They're supposed to be silent weapons for quiet wars,
[3:16:40.500 --> 3:16:43.700]  but instead they're making too big of a noise.
[3:16:43.700 --> 3:16:45.820]  But it's too late for them to turn back now.
[3:16:45.820 --> 3:16:47.580]  They're coming after our children.
[3:16:47.580 --> 3:16:50.340]  So it's up to us to protect our little children,
[3:16:50.340 --> 3:16:52.660]  or God will not look favorably on us.
[3:16:52.660 --> 3:16:55.140]  Remember, God is watching.
[3:16:57.420 --> 3:16:59.620]  Get our great bag of it here.
[3:16:59.620 --> 3:17:01.020]  I mean, this is from, people say,
[3:17:01.020 --> 3:17:04.180]  why is it from Chiapas, Mexico, the communists?
[3:17:04.180 --> 3:17:06.420]  Well, that's where some of the best coffee in the world
[3:17:06.420 --> 3:17:09.060]  that's wild harvested above organic
[3:17:09.060 --> 3:17:11.500]  in the volcanic soil, better than Guatemalan coffee.
[3:17:11.500 --> 3:17:13.540]  And yeah, we buy it from the little farmers
[3:17:13.540 --> 3:17:15.060]  that, you know, the media calls communists,
[3:17:15.060 --> 3:17:16.220]  but really they're just a commune.
[3:17:16.220 --> 3:17:18.540]  And whatever the point is, is that it's good coffee
[3:17:18.540 --> 3:17:20.020]  and we've got it, and the farmers
[3:17:20.020 --> 3:17:21.500]  don't let the Mexican government take over.
[3:17:21.500 --> 3:17:23.300]  So I actually buy this from the Mexican rebels,
[3:17:23.300 --> 3:17:24.860]  and I've been buying it for, what, 14 years,
[3:17:24.860 --> 3:17:25.980]  and the price has never gone up.
[3:17:25.980 --> 3:17:28.020]  The same stuff's sold at Whole Foods under another name
[3:17:28.020 --> 3:17:30.140]  for about 50% more, per pound,
[3:17:30.140 --> 3:17:31.700]  and I just think it's some of the best coffee
[3:17:31.700 --> 3:17:32.780]  you're gonna find anywhere.
[3:17:32.780 --> 3:17:34.620]  It's Wake Up America, Patriot Blend,
[3:17:34.620 --> 3:17:37.180]  from the Chiapas rebels, literally.
[3:17:37.180 --> 3:17:39.340]  In fact, I'm not gonna tell you a little story.
[3:17:41.860 --> 3:17:43.180]  Yeah, I'd like to.
[3:17:43.180 --> 3:17:44.300]  I'm not saying you wouldn't believe it.
[3:17:44.300 --> 3:17:47.140]  Anyway, so, it's infowarstore.com,
[3:17:47.140 --> 3:17:48.860]  and that's how we fund this operation.
[3:17:48.860 --> 3:17:51.460]  And if you don't fund us and don't want us here, that's fine.
[3:17:55.140 --> 3:17:59.780]  In late August, Info War saw an explosion of orders
[3:17:59.780 --> 3:18:01.980]  because our audience understands
[3:18:01.980 --> 3:18:05.100]  that the globalists are destabilizing the planet
[3:18:05.100 --> 3:18:07.460]  by design and are attempting to cause
[3:18:07.460 --> 3:18:11.380]  an economic and financial collapse worldwide.
[3:18:11.380 --> 3:18:12.220]  Now, ladies and gentlemen,
[3:18:12.220 --> 3:18:15.020]  storable food has always been something that's important to have.
[3:18:15.020 --> 3:18:16.980]  It's a checkbox that everybody needs to have,
[3:18:16.980 --> 3:18:19.940]  taking care of, right along with water filtration,
[3:18:19.940 --> 3:18:22.380]  self-defense, and a relationship with God.
[3:18:22.380 --> 3:18:23.820]  But now, more than ever,
[3:18:23.820 --> 3:18:25.740]  you need to get your storable food orders in.
[3:18:25.740 --> 3:18:27.540]  Now, we're ready to ship to you
[3:18:27.540 --> 3:18:29.140]  within 24 hours of your order.
[3:18:29.140 --> 3:18:31.500]  It's high quality, it's very, very low cost,
[3:18:31.500 --> 3:18:33.220]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:33.220 --> 3:18:34.620]  Because in the future,
[3:18:34.620 --> 3:18:36.900]  you're gonna see more food supply shortages,
[3:18:36.900 --> 3:18:38.380]  and you're gonna see food supply
[3:18:38.380 --> 3:18:40.540]  price increases that are already taking place.
[3:18:40.540 --> 3:18:43.500]  So lock in your storable food now at a lower price,
[3:18:43.500 --> 3:18:46.740]  and fund the Info War at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:46.740 --> 3:18:48.620]  That's how you fight the great reset,
[3:18:48.620 --> 3:18:51.500]  is by being self-sufficient and not under their control.
[3:18:51.500 --> 3:18:54.300]  So get prepared now at infowarstore.com.
[3:18:57.180 --> 3:18:58.820]  This is a great sponsor.
[3:18:58.820 --> 3:19:00.980]  We have one of the best deals you're gonna find out there
[3:19:00.980 --> 3:19:04.260]  on a high quality, high rated satellite phone.
[3:19:04.260 --> 3:19:06.140]  So you can't be tracked, you can't be traced,
[3:19:06.140 --> 3:19:08.060]  and it'll work anywhere in the world
[3:19:08.060 --> 3:19:09.060]  where you can see the sky.
[3:19:09.060 --> 3:19:10.940]  You can also buy cheap antennas and things
[3:19:10.940 --> 3:19:13.220]  for your car and your house that also are on the site.
[3:19:13.220 --> 3:19:15.180]  infowarstore.com.
[3:19:15.180 --> 3:19:16.700]  That's just a site that takes you to these folks.
[3:19:16.700 --> 3:19:18.100]  They supply the board for all everybody,
[3:19:18.100 --> 3:19:19.580]  with their systems as well.
[3:19:19.580 --> 3:19:21.740]  They're amazing folks, and you get a free phone,
[3:19:21.740 --> 3:19:23.660]  a $600 to $50 value.
[3:19:23.660 --> 3:19:27.700]  Absolutely free at infowarstore.com.
[3:19:27.700 --> 3:19:29.900]  Smartphones are always tracking everything you do.
[3:19:29.900 --> 3:19:30.740]  These aren't.
[3:19:30.740 --> 3:19:32.340]  And the calls are free when folks call you.
[3:19:32.340 --> 3:19:35.780]  You just pay $99.95 a month for your minutes,
[3:19:35.780 --> 3:19:37.100]  115 minutes.
[3:19:37.100 --> 3:19:38.300]  So the calls you were free,
[3:19:38.300 --> 3:19:39.460]  it works like a regular cell phone.
[3:19:39.460 --> 3:19:40.740]  You're not being tracked or traced.
[3:19:40.740 --> 3:19:41.980]  And I keep one on my car.
[3:19:41.980 --> 3:19:43.860]  I've given it to my parents as gifts,
[3:19:43.860 --> 3:19:44.700]  way out the middle of nowhere,
[3:19:44.700 --> 3:19:46.220]  where regular phones don't work, they work.
[3:19:46.220 --> 3:19:51.220]  infowarstore.com or 941-955-1029-4195-1020,
[3:19:51.740 --> 3:19:53.580]  and ask the Alex Jones special.
[3:19:57.500 --> 3:20:00.300]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:20:00.300 --> 3:20:11.380]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:20:11.380 --> 3:20:12.540]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:20:12.540 --> 3:20:16.020]  I'm your guest host, Jay and I are Jay's analysis.
[3:20:16.020 --> 3:20:18.300]  By the way, I wrote two books on MKUltra
[3:20:18.300 --> 3:20:20.500]  and their connection of these projects
[3:20:20.500 --> 3:20:23.980]  to Hollywood multiple sections in both of my books
[3:20:23.980 --> 3:20:25.620]  are available at my website.
[3:20:25.620 --> 3:20:27.100]  If you're interested, you can go to Jay's and also
[3:20:27.100 --> 3:20:28.100]  sit in the shop there.
[3:20:28.100 --> 3:20:31.180]  If you wanna get your friends and family members
[3:20:31.180 --> 3:20:34.180]  some good material using movies to wake them up,
[3:20:34.180 --> 3:20:36.900]  you can get copies of Esoteric Hollywood one and two there.
[3:20:36.900 --> 3:20:38.220]  Sign copies of the website.
[3:20:38.220 --> 3:20:41.340]  Don't give your money to Jeffrey Bezos.
[3:20:41.340 --> 3:20:43.620]  He's just gonna put it into the Rockets
[3:20:43.620 --> 3:20:45.460]  and take people to Mars,
[3:20:45.460 --> 3:20:46.860]  which is probably not even gonna happen.
[3:20:46.860 --> 3:20:48.300]  So don't give him your money.
[3:20:50.300 --> 3:20:51.460]  We were talking about Bakaville.
[3:20:51.460 --> 3:20:55.180]  We were talking about the project Midnight Climax.
[3:20:55.180 --> 3:20:57.100]  And the next one I wanna mention is
[3:20:57.100 --> 3:20:58.580]  Operation MKUltra.
[3:20:58.580 --> 3:21:01.620]  This dealt with the interrogation of people
[3:21:01.620 --> 3:21:04.380]  who were suspected of being foreign agents
[3:21:04.380 --> 3:21:06.700]  and spying on US installations.
[3:21:06.700 --> 3:21:11.700]  These were conducted at CIA safe houses during the Cold War.
[3:21:12.100 --> 3:21:15.420]  Similar to this is one known as Operation Mindbender.
[3:21:15.420 --> 3:21:17.740]  And this one's weird because this one actually morphs
[3:21:17.740 --> 3:21:21.860]  into I believe spellbinder here in a little bit.
[3:21:21.860 --> 3:21:24.900]  But Mindbender was first and it wasn't really successful
[3:21:24.900 --> 3:21:26.420]  but it was conducted in Mexico.
[3:21:26.420 --> 3:21:29.740]  But it involved the use of undercover hypnotherapists.
[3:21:29.740 --> 3:21:32.100]  So what you'll start to notice as you get into this stuff
[3:21:32.100 --> 3:21:35.700]  is that a lot of psychiatrists, therapists, psychologists,
[3:21:35.700 --> 3:21:38.180]  they were also part of these projects
[3:21:38.180 --> 3:21:39.860]  and they were studying all kinds of things.
[3:21:39.860 --> 3:21:42.380]  They even study eventually people
[3:21:42.380 --> 3:21:46.020]  that have severe sexual issues, perversions.
[3:21:46.020 --> 3:21:49.500]  All of these things are studied to the minutia level
[3:21:49.500 --> 3:21:52.340]  in order to ultimately weaponize this stuff.
[3:21:52.340 --> 3:21:54.980]  I'll get into that in a moment with the study
[3:21:54.980 --> 3:21:57.540]  of sexual deviance that they did.
[3:21:57.540 --> 3:21:59.700]  That I really had to dig to find this one.
[3:21:59.700 --> 3:22:01.460]  That one was really crazy.
[3:22:01.460 --> 3:22:03.700]  And not a lot of people know about that
[3:22:03.700 --> 3:22:05.740]  but we begin to see, well now wait a minute,
[3:22:05.740 --> 3:22:09.180]  if they weren't really deep into studying sexual deviance
[3:22:09.180 --> 3:22:12.540]  then perhaps they could also weaponize sexuality, right?
[3:22:12.540 --> 3:22:14.580]  I think everybody can kind of pick up on that now
[3:22:14.580 --> 3:22:17.660]  in the way that the culture has gone.
[3:22:17.660 --> 3:22:19.860]  But in Mexico City, they were experimenting
[3:22:19.860 --> 3:22:23.740]  with using victims under hypnosis that could be programmed
[3:22:23.740 --> 3:22:28.140]  through a combination of intense solution to drugs,
[3:22:29.500 --> 3:22:30.740]  patterning and re-imprinting.
[3:22:30.740 --> 3:22:33.460]  And this is where, reportedly, was the first experiment
[3:22:33.460 --> 3:22:36.220]  on an attempted undercover assassin
[3:22:36.220 --> 3:22:38.340]  that could carry out orders to kill
[3:22:38.340 --> 3:22:40.940]  after being triggered into action
[3:22:40.940 --> 3:22:42.460]  through the pre-programmed signal.
[3:22:42.460 --> 3:22:45.140]  The trigger phrase, the key word.
[3:22:45.140 --> 3:22:47.660]  If you think about movies, again,
[3:22:47.660 --> 3:22:49.220]  this is where we typically see this
[3:22:49.220 --> 3:22:50.340]  in Hollywood productions.
[3:22:50.340 --> 3:22:52.180]  Think about one of the most famous examples
[3:22:52.180 --> 3:22:53.700]  in the modern mentoring candidate
[3:22:53.700 --> 3:22:56.340]  where certain triggers and things that he sees
[3:22:56.340 --> 3:22:59.180]  causes him to do the assassin action.
[3:22:59.180 --> 3:23:01.380]  If you think about the modern mentoring candidate
[3:23:01.380 --> 3:23:06.380]  with Lee Schreiber in terms of the assassin character
[3:23:08.420 --> 3:23:12.020]  of this program, he eventually has a microchip put in him
[3:23:12.020 --> 3:23:15.580]  and the microchip causes him to commit the assassination
[3:23:15.580 --> 3:23:16.820]  action towards the end.
[3:23:18.620 --> 3:23:20.660]  There were bio warfare agents that were used
[3:23:20.660 --> 3:23:23.580]  in M.K. Search, and M.K. Search is typically
[3:23:23.580 --> 3:23:27.060]  what moves us into, in terms of these projects,
[3:23:27.060 --> 3:23:28.700]  the transhumanist element.
[3:23:28.700 --> 3:23:30.980]  So a lot of people know about,
[3:23:30.980 --> 3:23:33.540]  you've heard me talk about Dr. John C. Lilly.
[3:23:33.540 --> 3:23:37.060]  John C. Lilly was dosing up, flipper dosing up
[3:23:37.060 --> 3:23:40.540]  all of the different animals, including mainly
[3:23:40.540 --> 3:23:42.420]  his weird fixation for dolphins.
[3:23:42.420 --> 3:23:46.740]  And so what he was actually doing was experimenting on dolphins
[3:23:46.740 --> 3:23:49.900]  the way that they give off their signals,
[3:23:49.900 --> 3:23:53.220]  their sonic signals and whatever, brain signals.
[3:23:53.220 --> 3:23:55.740]  And so he was trying to see what could happen
[3:23:55.740 --> 3:23:59.860]  with the implementation of electrodes and implants.
[3:23:59.860 --> 3:24:02.020]  And he was also working by the way in his biography,
[3:24:02.020 --> 3:24:04.660]  he describes with monkeys.
[3:24:04.660 --> 3:24:06.980]  And this connects to Dr. Sidney Gottlieb,
[3:24:06.980 --> 3:24:10.660]  who was also doing similar research with these agents
[3:24:10.660 --> 3:24:14.020]  and with these drugs and with the microchips.
[3:24:14.020 --> 3:24:16.740]  So the operation M.K. Search under Dr. Gottlieb
[3:24:16.740 --> 3:24:19.780]  was researching microorganisms with the capacity to kill
[3:24:19.780 --> 3:24:20.820]  that is bio warfare.
[3:24:20.820 --> 3:24:25.020]  So M.K. Ultra, when it's exposed, it goes under cover
[3:24:25.020 --> 3:24:28.980]  and it becomes M.K. Search at Fort Detrick.
[3:24:28.980 --> 3:24:31.820]  The Army Biological Warfare Laboratory at Fort Detrick
[3:24:31.820 --> 3:24:34.460]  became a running operation since 1952,
[3:24:34.460 --> 3:24:36.860]  also known as M.K. Naomi.
[3:24:36.860 --> 3:24:40.100]  And these are the areas where we start to get into the projects
[3:24:40.100 --> 3:24:41.900]  where people again in through pop culture
[3:24:41.900 --> 3:24:44.540]  are more familiar with Project Bluebird,
[3:24:44.540 --> 3:24:48.860]  Project Artichoke, and these are all Project Monarch,
[3:24:48.860 --> 3:24:51.300]  with the butterfly, the transformation of individuals
[3:24:51.300 --> 3:24:56.220]  into new personalities, new alters
[3:24:56.220 --> 3:24:58.620]  that could carry the courier information.
[3:24:58.620 --> 3:25:01.380]  There's also, at least the last time I checked,
[3:25:01.380 --> 3:25:04.820]  in the DSMV, there is still references
[3:25:04.820 --> 3:25:09.220]  to Dr. George Estabrooks, a famous essay from,
[3:25:09.220 --> 3:25:13.460]  I think the 50s, where he talks about the hypnotic courier.
[3:25:13.460 --> 3:25:14.940]  And so he wrote this essay,
[3:25:14.940 --> 3:25:16.860]  it's still referenced in the scholarly literature
[3:25:16.860 --> 3:25:19.700]  about how you could program into people
[3:25:19.700 --> 3:25:21.860]  that have dissociative identity or disorder
[3:25:21.860 --> 3:25:24.500]  or people who have alternate personalities.
[3:25:24.500 --> 3:25:27.700]  The plan was, could you program certain alters
[3:25:27.700 --> 3:25:30.420]  with information that could not be extracted
[3:25:30.420 --> 3:25:33.020]  through counterintelligence measures,
[3:25:33.020 --> 3:25:35.620]  through torture and so forth.
[3:25:35.620 --> 3:25:37.700]  And at least as far as we can tell,
[3:25:37.700 --> 3:25:39.420]  it appears to be that there was some success
[3:25:39.420 --> 3:25:42.580]  in those programs, according to Dr. Estabrooks.
[3:25:42.580 --> 3:25:44.300]  But so this brings in hypnosis, right?
[3:25:44.300 --> 3:25:49.300]  So hypnosis, hypnoregression, psychiatry, psychology,
[3:25:49.620 --> 3:25:52.140]  big pharma, drugs, they're all part of these programs,
[3:25:52.140 --> 3:25:54.780]  they're all in various levels in various ways,
[3:25:54.780 --> 3:25:55.860]  participating in this.
[3:25:55.860 --> 3:25:58.540]  But at a compartmentalized level,
[3:25:58.540 --> 3:26:00.060]  can keep that in mind, because of course,
[3:26:00.060 --> 3:26:01.820]  everybody says, well, how could they do this?
[3:26:01.820 --> 3:26:04.580]  Everybody would find out if they did this and we'd all know.
[3:26:04.580 --> 3:26:07.740]  Well, we do know, it's all out, they did talk about it.
[3:26:07.740 --> 3:26:09.900]  But it takes many decades for this to come out
[3:26:09.900 --> 3:26:11.980]  and the people in the various projects,
[3:26:11.980 --> 3:26:15.060]  they don't know what's going on in other projects.
[3:26:15.060 --> 3:26:17.260]  Some of these projects are conducted in through,
[3:26:17.260 --> 3:26:19.340]  black ops, through organized crime, through the mafia.
[3:26:19.340 --> 3:26:21.780]  Some of these projects are conducted
[3:26:21.780 --> 3:26:25.140]  under the cover of just psychiatry and psychology.
[3:26:25.140 --> 3:26:26.980]  Some of the projects are conducted through cutouts,
[3:26:26.980 --> 3:26:28.500]  like the Human Ecology Foundation,
[3:26:28.500 --> 3:26:31.540]  that was actually a CIA front for MKLTRA.
[3:26:31.540 --> 3:26:34.300]  So a lot of these things didn't appear as just,
[3:26:34.300 --> 3:26:36.580]  oh, we're doing a mind control operation,
[3:26:36.580 --> 3:26:37.660]  do you wanna participate?
[3:26:37.660 --> 3:26:39.940]  It was all conducted covertly.
[3:26:39.940 --> 3:26:42.340]  Similarly, studies like Alfred Kinsey,
[3:26:42.340 --> 3:26:44.340]  who was funded by the Rockefeller Foundation
[3:26:44.340 --> 3:26:47.500]  to do his, what would be considered,
[3:26:47.500 --> 3:26:50.340]  pedophilia and human rights violation studies.
[3:26:50.340 --> 3:26:52.660]  I mean, he was getting funding to do similar types
[3:26:52.660 --> 3:26:54.940]  of experiments on molesting children.
[3:26:54.940 --> 3:26:56.620]  This is famous, this is well known.
[3:26:57.980 --> 3:27:01.860]  And that, I think, also went into similar types of research.
[3:27:01.860 --> 3:27:03.780]  So all of this off the books, war time,
[3:27:03.780 --> 3:27:05.460]  and they'll do this stuff during war too.
[3:27:05.460 --> 3:27:08.340]  They'll do these studies and these research through war,
[3:27:08.340 --> 3:27:10.860]  where there is no oversight, there is no purview,
[3:27:10.860 --> 3:27:13.660]  that can get away with bypassing the law
[3:27:13.660 --> 3:27:15.820]  through war time research.
[3:27:15.820 --> 3:27:18.220]  So if you think about Vietnam,
[3:27:18.220 --> 3:27:19.900]  if you think about what I covered,
[3:27:19.900 --> 3:27:21.700]  I don't know, maybe three or four months ago
[3:27:21.700 --> 3:27:24.580]  on the fourth hour, we went into the history of DARPA
[3:27:24.580 --> 3:27:27.340]  and how it was involved in the Vietnam War.
[3:27:27.340 --> 3:27:29.180]  That was the first place that drones were used.
[3:27:29.180 --> 3:27:30.780]  That was the first place that you had
[3:27:32.900 --> 3:27:35.980]  automatic explosive devices being used.
[3:27:35.980 --> 3:27:38.980]  And that was all rolled out as part of DARPA experimentation.
[3:27:38.980 --> 3:27:41.140]  So remember that war time research
[3:27:41.140 --> 3:27:43.340]  is not just about winning that immediate war,
[3:27:43.340 --> 3:27:46.300]  it's about taking the information that's studied
[3:27:46.300 --> 3:27:49.420]  in terms of human psychology, human sociology,
[3:27:49.420 --> 3:27:51.980]  and applying that to the future situations
[3:27:51.980 --> 3:27:53.620]  and future technocratic scenarios.
[3:27:53.620 --> 3:27:55.860]  So they've taken all of this war time research,
[3:27:55.860 --> 3:27:58.420]  all this drug research, all this MK Ultra research,
[3:27:58.420 --> 3:28:00.380]  all of this goes into a big bundle
[3:28:00.380 --> 3:28:03.180]  about how to control society.
[3:28:03.180 --> 3:28:04.740]  Remember what I just covered last time,
[3:28:04.740 --> 3:28:06.740]  the silent weapons for quiet wars document,
[3:28:06.740 --> 3:28:08.420]  early on in that document, that white paper,
[3:28:08.420 --> 3:28:12.020]  they say, we just took all of our war time R&D
[3:28:12.020 --> 3:28:14.700]  and we're just applying it now to controlling society,
[3:28:14.700 --> 3:28:16.940]  to bring it into the technocracy.
[3:28:16.940 --> 3:28:19.340]  Literally a hundred years of research and information
[3:28:19.340 --> 3:28:23.580]  is just co-opted into turning us into these drones
[3:28:23.580 --> 3:28:26.540]  in the board hive mind metaverse technocracy.
[3:28:26.540 --> 3:28:27.900]  That's what it's all about.

[3:29:16.220 --> 3:29:17.820]  turmeric root that's so amazing,
[3:29:17.820 --> 3:29:20.420]  chaga musher, bee pollen, goji berry,
[3:29:20.420 --> 3:29:21.900]  alfalfa herb powder.
[3:29:21.900 --> 3:29:25.300]  Then it's got added magnesium and potassium for electrolytes.
[3:29:25.300 --> 3:29:28.460]  It's got real organic cocoa bean powder
[3:29:28.460 --> 3:29:31.860]  with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[3:29:31.860 --> 3:29:33.820]  It even tastes better than last formula.

[3:29:36.540 --> 3:29:40.380]  And again, it has that cutting edge chicken broth protein,
[3:29:40.380 --> 3:29:43.740]  isolate powder for better flavor and dissolvability.

[3:29:55.500 --> 3:29:58.380]  The purpose of fear is to call us into action
[3:29:58.380 --> 3:30:00.900]  and there is plenty to be afraid of today.
[3:30:00.900 --> 3:30:03.900]  Half the population has lined up for an untested,
[3:30:03.900 --> 3:30:06.820]  deadly and debilitating experimental injection
[3:30:06.820 --> 3:30:08.380]  because they were told to be afraid
[3:30:08.380 --> 3:30:10.980]  of an invisible asymptomatic disease.
[3:30:10.980 --> 3:30:14.020]  The perpetrators of all this have clearly stated their goal
[3:30:14.020 --> 3:30:16.620]  of having 80% of the population hooked up
[3:30:16.620 --> 3:30:19.220]  to an artificial intelligence hive mind
[3:30:19.220 --> 3:30:20.940]  in less than nine years.
[3:30:20.940 --> 3:30:23.340]  For those of us who have awoken from the spell,
[3:30:23.340 --> 3:30:25.180]  we know this is all really happening
[3:30:25.180 --> 3:30:27.740]  and it's unbelievably unsettling to see.
[3:30:27.740 --> 3:30:30.300]  But there is only two things to do.
[3:30:30.300 --> 3:30:33.380]  We continue sounding the alarm because it's a numbers game.
[3:30:33.380 --> 3:30:36.740]  If enough people awaken from the cold spell, then we win.
[3:30:36.740 --> 3:30:39.460]  But even when we win and we eventually will,
[3:30:39.460 --> 3:30:42.100]  the days of convenience are soon coming to an end.
[3:30:42.100 --> 3:30:43.940]  And so we must prepare,
[3:30:43.940 --> 3:30:46.340]  get up to a years worth of storable foods,
[3:30:46.340 --> 3:30:49.740]  water filtration, survival gear, seeds,
[3:30:49.740 --> 3:30:52.900]  shortwave radios and lifesaving knowledge
[3:30:52.900 --> 3:30:54.980]  at infowarstore.com.
[3:30:54.980 --> 3:30:58.460]  UN run contact tracers aren't coming, they're here.
[3:30:58.460 --> 3:31:00.540]  All over the world, from Australia
[3:31:00.540 --> 3:31:02.900]  to the United States, from Canada to Germany.
[3:31:02.900 --> 3:31:05.060]  These tyrants are tracking everything you do
[3:31:05.060 --> 3:31:06.980]  everywhere you go and then coming to your house
[3:31:06.980 --> 3:31:08.460]  and threatening in some cases,
[3:31:08.460 --> 3:31:11.900]  actually taking people away into the night
[3:31:11.900 --> 3:31:13.300]  to their facilities.
[3:31:13.300 --> 3:31:14.980]  And they're planning in the next year
[3:31:14.980 --> 3:31:17.740]  to expand their shield process where they come
[3:31:17.740 --> 3:31:19.820]  and take quote healthy people away
[3:31:19.820 --> 3:31:21.900]  and put them in facilities for their safety.
[3:31:21.900 --> 3:31:23.700]  This is nothing less than martial law.

[3:33:06.620 --> 3:33:09.780]  ["The New World Order"]
[3:33:11.820 --> 3:33:12.940]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show.
[3:33:12.940 --> 3:33:15.340]  I'm your guest host, Jay Dyer, Jay's analysis.

[3:33:25.340 --> 3:33:27.460]  you can find me on Instagram, YouTube,
[3:33:27.460 --> 3:33:29.180]  and mainly at my website, of course,
[3:33:29.180 --> 3:33:30.620]  as well as on Rockfin,
[3:33:30.620 --> 3:33:32.620]  which is a free speech-based platform.
[3:33:32.620 --> 3:33:34.300]  You can sign up for that for free as well
[3:33:34.300 --> 3:33:35.580]  to follow my material.
[3:33:36.420 --> 3:33:39.140]  Next, I wanna talk about the operation Big City.
[3:33:39.140 --> 3:33:43.780]  Now, this is one which might surprise you,
[3:33:43.780 --> 3:33:46.660]  although if you're familiar with what we talk about here,
[3:33:46.660 --> 3:33:51.100]  you won't be surprised because the idea of
[3:33:51.100 --> 3:33:54.220]  spraying an entire city or an entire neighborhood
[3:33:54.220 --> 3:33:58.460]  with something like LSD doesn't sound strange to me at all.
[3:33:58.460 --> 3:34:00.620]  And I think a lot of normies would feel like,
[3:34:00.620 --> 3:34:02.140]  oh, they wouldn't do that.
[3:34:02.140 --> 3:34:02.980]  They would never do that.
[3:34:02.980 --> 3:34:05.020]  Well, if they would spray whole cities
[3:34:05.020 --> 3:34:06.060]  with this kind of stuff,
[3:34:06.060 --> 3:34:09.140]  if you think about the Sunshine Project,
[3:34:09.140 --> 3:34:11.220]  which I read those documents 20 years ago
[3:34:11.220 --> 3:34:13.020]  when Alex was talking about them,
[3:34:13.020 --> 3:34:16.060]  nerve-gassing entire cities in wartime scenarios
[3:34:16.060 --> 3:34:18.380]  or in a continuity of government emergency scenario.
[3:34:18.380 --> 3:34:20.140]  I mean, there's many, many examples of this.
[3:34:20.140 --> 3:34:22.260]  In fact, it's been declassified in many cases
[3:34:22.260 --> 3:34:25.860]  where radiation was experimented on entire cities.
[3:34:25.860 --> 3:34:30.860]  I think St. Louis had an entire biological experiment
[3:34:30.980 --> 3:34:33.660]  basically blown out on them.
[3:34:33.660 --> 3:34:37.300]  And as well as the engineering, geoengineering projects.
[3:34:37.300 --> 3:34:39.740]  I mean, that's something that's well known declassified now.
[3:34:39.740 --> 3:34:41.500]  John Brennan has given talks about it.
[3:34:41.500 --> 3:34:44.060]  There's countless papers at the Royal Society
[3:34:44.060 --> 3:34:47.420]  about geoengineering, ELF, VLF, weather modifications
[3:34:47.420 --> 3:34:49.100]  been going on for decades.
[3:34:49.100 --> 3:34:50.260]  And yet people still think
[3:34:50.260 --> 3:34:52.140]  that's some kind of crazy, tin-full hat thing.
[3:34:52.140 --> 3:34:54.060]  Well, during the M. K. Alcher experiments,
[3:34:54.060 --> 3:34:57.540]  Operation Big City dealt with emitting a gas
[3:34:57.540 --> 3:34:59.780]  that was sprayed out upon passers-by
[3:34:59.780 --> 3:35:04.100]  in various New York neighborhoods and subways.
[3:35:04.100 --> 3:35:05.980]  Battery-powered emission equipment
[3:35:05.980 --> 3:35:09.740]  was fitted into suitcases to see if LCD
[3:35:09.740 --> 3:35:12.820]  could be sprayed into confined areas to affect people.
[3:35:12.820 --> 3:35:15.220]  The operators wore nasal filters themselves
[3:35:15.220 --> 3:35:16.140]  in San Francisco.
[3:35:16.140 --> 3:35:18.420]  A separate project involved biological gas
[3:35:18.420 --> 3:35:20.300]  released on the Golden Gate Bridge
[3:35:20.300 --> 3:35:22.740]  with the intention of trying to cover the city.
[3:35:22.740 --> 3:35:24.660]  This reminds me of, doesn't that,
[3:35:24.660 --> 3:35:26.740]  isn't that what the League of Shadows does
[3:35:26.740 --> 3:35:30.140]  in the original Batman, the first Christopher Nolan Batman?
[3:35:30.140 --> 3:35:34.460]  I think the Ra's Al Ghoul character who,
[3:35:34.460 --> 3:35:37.020]  by the way, is said to be based, I think, on Crowley.
[3:35:37.020 --> 3:35:38.500]  According to my research
[3:35:38.500 --> 3:35:41.860]  on that original Christopher Nolan first Batman,
[3:35:41.860 --> 3:35:43.740]  doesn't he come up with this idea
[3:35:43.740 --> 3:35:48.100]  with scarecrow to dose the city with some kind of hallucinogen?
[3:35:48.100 --> 3:35:50.980]  This probably was coming out of Operation Big City,
[3:35:50.980 --> 3:35:54.220]  so maybe Gotham, right?
[3:35:54.220 --> 3:35:55.980]  That's real, that's the thing here,
[3:35:55.980 --> 3:35:57.380]  and that's why I covered in my book
[3:35:57.380 --> 3:35:59.820]  so many of these films was that
[3:35:59.820 --> 3:36:02.300]  if you have watched a lot of films over the years,
[3:36:02.300 --> 3:36:04.620]  it's amazing, really, how many movies
[3:36:04.620 --> 3:36:07.540]  have the MK Ultra themes in them.
[3:36:07.540 --> 3:36:10.500]  Not just the actual projects of assassins and all that,
[3:36:10.500 --> 3:36:13.940]  but the symbology connected with this whole idea
[3:36:13.940 --> 3:36:16.820]  of the Monarch butterfly, the Alice in Wonderland
[3:36:16.820 --> 3:36:18.980]  going down the rabbit hole.
[3:36:18.980 --> 3:36:22.300]  I mean, even just something as pop-cultury
[3:36:22.300 --> 3:36:25.100]  and video game connected like Resident Evil.
[3:36:25.100 --> 3:36:27.340]  Actually, that whole series is a direct reference
[3:36:27.340 --> 3:36:29.580]  in many, many places, both the video games
[3:36:29.580 --> 3:36:31.780]  and the films, to MK Ultra.
[3:36:31.780 --> 3:36:34.140]  You think about it, the main character, Mila Jovovich.
[3:36:34.140 --> 3:36:35.940]  She's a private security contractor
[3:36:35.940 --> 3:36:39.380]  who is unwittingly recruited into these projects
[3:36:39.380 --> 3:36:41.420]  and involves biometric implants,
[3:36:41.420 --> 3:36:44.340]  cloning, mind control, alternate personalities,
[3:36:44.340 --> 3:36:46.260]  and she's trained to be this assassin and so forth.
[3:36:46.260 --> 3:36:49.540]  So all of this, this is all everywhere in pop culture.
[3:36:49.540 --> 3:36:50.700]  I think in the new Resident Evil,
[3:36:50.700 --> 3:36:52.500]  they even mentioned MK Ultra, in fact.
[3:36:54.140 --> 3:36:58.300]  MK Ultra sub-project operation resurrection.
[3:36:58.300 --> 3:36:59.740]  Now, this involved Dr. Cameron
[3:36:59.740 --> 3:37:01.140]  and the Allen Memorial Institute.
[3:37:01.140 --> 3:37:03.740]  And by the way, keep in mind that if I recall,
[3:37:03.740 --> 3:37:06.540]  Dr. Cameron was coming out of McGill University in Canada
[3:37:06.540 --> 3:37:09.660]  and who was the big name from McGill University?
[3:37:11.020 --> 3:37:11.940]  It's a big New Brzezinski.
[3:37:11.940 --> 3:37:14.260]  In fact, in the Big New Brzezinski's book,
[3:37:14.260 --> 3:37:17.700]  he will make reference to biometric implants,
[3:37:17.700 --> 3:37:20.340]  Skynet, ELF, ELF technology,
[3:37:20.340 --> 3:37:23.540]  back in his 70s book, Technocratic Era.
[3:37:23.540 --> 3:37:26.380]  I wanna step over to that just for a second
[3:37:26.380 --> 3:37:29.380]  in between two ages, where he has this amazing quote
[3:37:29.380 --> 3:37:32.140]  where he says, early on in the book,
[3:37:32.140 --> 3:37:34.460]  now he wrote this back in the early 70s,
[3:37:34.460 --> 3:37:38.820]  the human being being more synthetic than authentic.
[3:37:38.820 --> 3:37:42.980]  Even our senses perceive an entirely novel reality.
[3:37:42.980 --> 3:37:45.100]  One of our own making, nonetheless,
[3:37:45.100 --> 3:37:47.460]  in terms of our sensations, it is quite real.
[3:37:47.460 --> 3:37:49.980]  More important, there are already widespread concerns
[3:37:49.980 --> 3:37:54.180]  about the possibility of biological and chemical tampering
[3:37:54.180 --> 3:37:55.380]  with what has now been considered
[3:37:55.380 --> 3:37:56.900]  the immutable essence of man.
[3:37:56.900 --> 3:38:00.700]  He's talking about mRNA, DNA mutations
[3:38:00.700 --> 3:38:03.100]  and experimentation back in the 70s.
[3:38:03.100 --> 3:38:04.580]  Now, where have we heard this recently?
[3:38:04.580 --> 3:38:07.260]  I wonder where, I wonder where we've heard this.
[3:38:07.260 --> 3:38:09.540]  Man is increasingly acquiring,
[3:38:09.540 --> 3:38:10.540]  excuse me, let me go back a little bit,
[3:38:10.540 --> 3:38:14.940]  human conduct, to some argue, can be predetermined
[3:38:14.940 --> 3:38:16.980]  and subjected to deliberate control.
[3:38:16.980 --> 3:38:19.220]  Man is increasingly acquiring the capacity
[3:38:19.220 --> 3:38:22.380]  to determine the act of the sex of his children
[3:38:23.220 --> 3:38:26.020]  to affect through drugs the extent of their intelligence
[3:38:26.020 --> 3:38:28.820]  and to modify and control their personalities.
[3:38:28.820 --> 3:38:31.740]  So he's saying that it's becoming, even at that time,
[3:38:31.740 --> 3:38:34.100]  that ideas becoming normative, that in the future,
[3:38:34.100 --> 3:38:36.620]  we're going to be able to determine our children's sex.
[3:38:36.620 --> 3:38:38.740]  We're gonna modify them from the womb
[3:38:38.740 --> 3:38:41.980]  into being smart or the slave class or whatever.
[3:38:41.980 --> 3:38:43.420]  This is Brave New World stuff, right?
[3:38:43.420 --> 3:38:45.580]  If you remember Brave New World, the novel,
[3:38:45.580 --> 3:38:47.820]  some of the people are from the test tube,
[3:38:47.820 --> 3:38:50.020]  born to being janitors and some people are born
[3:38:50.020 --> 3:38:51.780]  into being CEOs or whatever.
[3:38:53.220 --> 3:38:55.860]  He goes on to say that in the footnote to that section
[3:38:55.860 --> 3:38:58.700]  that there will be a Skynet situation
[3:38:58.700 --> 3:39:00.860]  that's possible for computer technology
[3:39:00.860 --> 3:39:03.500]  to be linked up to all kinds of satellite networks.
[3:39:03.500 --> 3:39:06.980]  And basically we're gonna have a global technocratic grid
[3:39:06.980 --> 3:39:09.700]  that will connect Skynet to the human beings
[3:39:09.700 --> 3:39:12.020]  linked into this web.
[3:39:13.340 --> 3:39:18.340]  Brzezinski wrote this back in 1970.
[3:39:18.540 --> 3:39:21.540]  I thought I had it written in here, but 72 or three.
[3:39:23.060 --> 3:39:25.060]  Many, many years before Klaus Schwab
[3:39:25.060 --> 3:39:26.780]  wrote Fourth Industrial Revolution.
[3:39:26.780 --> 3:39:29.020]  So again, what you see is the continuity
[3:39:29.020 --> 3:39:32.420]  between this high level policy advisor guy, Brzezinski,
[3:39:32.420 --> 3:39:34.140]  back in the 70s.
[3:39:34.140 --> 3:39:38.220]  And he was tapped by Henry Kissinger
[3:39:38.220 --> 3:39:39.660]  and David Rockefeller to be the head
[3:39:39.660 --> 3:39:42.940]  of the newly created trilateral commission at the time.
[3:39:42.940 --> 3:39:45.500]  This book is what got Brzezinski that job.
[3:39:46.540 --> 3:39:47.940]  And Brzezinski would have known, by the way,
[3:39:47.940 --> 3:39:50.820]  about all of these McGill University MK Ultra projects.
[3:39:50.820 --> 3:39:52.580]  That's what I'm trying to get at here.
[3:39:52.580 --> 3:39:56.100]  And so he would have known that the real trajectory
[3:39:56.100 --> 3:39:59.300]  of these projects, of the human mutation of the brain
[3:39:59.300 --> 3:40:02.100]  and biometrics and implants and all of this,
[3:40:02.100 --> 3:40:05.540]  bottling modification, that was all geared towards
[3:40:05.540 --> 3:40:08.020]  the Skynet mind control situation,
[3:40:08.020 --> 3:40:11.660]  which Brzezinski on page 15 of his book says,
[3:40:11.660 --> 3:40:15.140]  is the mutation of man, genetic modification
[3:40:15.140 --> 3:40:18.380]  and mutating of man into something new, something else.
[3:40:20.180 --> 3:40:22.460]  And he says, I foresee the time
[3:40:22.460 --> 3:40:25.700]  when we shall have the means therefore, inevitably,
[3:40:25.700 --> 3:40:27.900]  the temptation to manipulate the behavior
[3:40:27.900 --> 3:40:31.140]  and intellectual functioning of all the people
[3:40:31.140 --> 3:40:33.380]  on the world through environmental,
[3:40:33.380 --> 3:40:36.020]  biochemical manipulation of the brain.
[3:40:37.940 --> 3:40:41.260]  And he's quoting a computer science guy.
[3:40:42.460 --> 3:40:44.900]  And that's where in the footnote he talks
[3:40:44.900 --> 3:40:48.700]  about the Skynet satellite situation that can be set up.
[3:40:48.700 --> 3:40:51.380]  Brzezinski talks about weather weapons in this book
[3:40:51.380 --> 3:40:54.820]  back in the 70s, page 57, he goes into the footnote
[3:40:54.820 --> 3:40:57.740]  about the ELF, VLF weather geoengineering technology.
[3:40:57.740 --> 3:40:59.660]  So what I'm trying to say is that,
[3:40:59.660 --> 3:41:02.020]  although that wasn't necessarily directly connected
[3:41:02.020 --> 3:41:05.740]  to MKUltra, what these projects are ultimately about
[3:41:05.740 --> 3:41:08.780]  is a rewriting of the entire biosphere
[3:41:08.780 --> 3:41:10.460]  to a synthetic reality.
[3:41:10.460 --> 3:41:13.020]  What did Klaus say a couple of years ago in his video?
[3:41:13.020 --> 3:41:16.220]  We will get inside you and we will change you.
[3:41:16.220 --> 3:41:18.340]  It's not about changing the world.
[3:41:18.340 --> 3:41:20.020]  It's not about veganism.
[3:41:20.020 --> 3:41:21.700]  It's not about a utopia.
[3:41:21.700 --> 3:41:24.740]  Well, it kind of is, but the utopia is when everybody dies,
[3:41:24.740 --> 3:41:26.100]  then we'll get rid of human suffering, right?
[3:41:26.100 --> 3:41:27.340]  What we can end human suffering,
[3:41:27.340 --> 3:41:29.260]  we should get rid of humans, you see.
[3:41:29.260 --> 3:41:31.420]  And so that's why he's saying, literally telling you
[3:41:31.420 --> 3:41:34.100]  that it's going to be you being changed, your DNA,
[3:41:34.100 --> 3:41:37.020]  your RNA, all of this manipulating and changing you
[3:41:37.020 --> 3:41:41.460]  into something else, which is a Borg hive mind entity.
[3:41:41.460 --> 3:41:45.420]  Now again, another one of the global elite texts I'll add
[3:41:45.420 --> 3:41:48.220]  as a kind of addendum here is,
[3:41:48.220 --> 3:41:50.100]  Brief History of the Future by Jacques Attali.
[3:41:50.100 --> 3:41:53.460]  Jacques Attali is the Kissinger of France.
[3:41:53.460 --> 3:41:57.540]  He is who coached Mitterrand
[3:41:57.540 --> 3:41:59.420]  and these different French presidents in the past.
[3:41:59.420 --> 3:42:00.540]  He's a major figure.
[3:42:00.540 --> 3:42:03.860]  He came out, what, six months ago, a year
[3:42:03.860 --> 3:42:06.060]  about his comments about the Stabbies.
[3:42:06.060 --> 3:42:07.940]  He talked about what the Stabbies would do
[3:42:07.940 --> 3:42:08.780]  in the future.
[3:42:08.780 --> 3:42:12.020]  Many years ago, they dug up an old interview of his.
[3:42:12.020 --> 3:42:14.700]  And in this book, in his 2000 book, Brief History of the Future,
[3:42:14.700 --> 3:42:20.540]  he says that this is his section on transhumanism.
[3:42:20.540 --> 3:42:23.300]  Yes, he has old chapter on transhumanism.
[3:42:23.300 --> 3:42:26.180]  And he says that the future is important that we realize
[3:42:26.180 --> 3:42:31.300]  the happiness of man depends on that of others.
[3:42:31.300 --> 3:42:35.100]  The human species can only survive if it is united
[3:42:35.100 --> 3:42:37.780]  into some of a global union, a global world order.
[3:42:37.780 --> 3:42:41.020]  And he says that these people who are championing
[3:42:41.020 --> 3:42:43.860]  this new revolution, I call them the transhumanists.
[3:42:43.860 --> 3:42:47.100]  They are the vanguard of the new world order.
[3:42:47.100 --> 3:42:47.780]  That's his quote.
[3:42:47.780 --> 3:42:52.260]  The vanguard of the new world order is the transhumanists.
[3:42:52.260 --> 3:42:54.260]  So again, this is all connected to.
[3:42:54.260 --> 3:42:58.180]  We have developed the research and the tools
[3:42:58.180 --> 3:43:00.540]  to stop this evil and to break free from it
[3:43:00.540 --> 3:43:02.260]  and to help others break free from it.
[3:43:02.260 --> 3:43:04.860]  That's why we've launched Reset Wars.
[3:43:04.860 --> 3:43:07.740]  Once you simply accept that there is an incredibly evil group
[3:43:07.740 --> 3:43:10.500]  of people in the world that are attempting the great reset
[3:43:10.500 --> 3:43:13.260]  and want a one world corporate government,
[3:43:13.260 --> 3:43:15.260]  then you can learn how to defeat them
[3:43:15.260 --> 3:43:17.780]  by learning their war game strategies
[3:43:17.780 --> 3:43:20.300]  and how to not play the game.
[3:43:20.300 --> 3:43:23.620]  After decades of intense research,
[3:43:23.620 --> 3:43:26.060]  our quest to discover the key to breaking
[3:43:26.060 --> 3:43:29.300]  the globalist bonds is now life.
[3:43:29.300 --> 3:43:32.180]  The Reset Wars have begun.
[3:43:32.180 --> 3:43:36.140]  Start your journey at resetwars.com today.
[3:43:36.140 --> 3:43:38.940]  Your programming are very subconscious on our psyche
[3:43:38.940 --> 3:43:42.860]  to create these false constructs that they then control.
[3:43:42.860 --> 3:43:44.540]  We're gonna lay out how that works.
[3:43:44.540 --> 3:43:47.460]  Your journey against tyranny and true empowerment begins
[3:43:47.460 --> 3:43:49.140]  at resetwars.com.
[3:43:49.140 --> 3:43:50.300]  Please join me there.
[3:43:50.300 --> 3:43:55.300]  The Reset Wars
[3:43:56.980 --> 3:43:58.860]  Cobra Commander here
[3:43:58.860 --> 3:44:02.260]  with an important message to humanity.
[3:44:02.260 --> 3:44:04.820]  I have decided that all of you
[3:44:04.820 --> 3:44:09.740]  will take a special injection so that you will be safe.
[3:44:09.740 --> 3:44:13.220]  But the injection is not ready yet.
[3:44:13.220 --> 3:44:18.140]  And so I need all of you to stay indoors
[3:44:18.140 --> 3:44:22.660]  for the next 15 days to flatten the can.
[3:44:22.660 --> 3:44:25.140]  I also need you to wear masks
[3:44:25.140 --> 3:44:30.140]  and I also need you to only shop at mega corporations.
[3:44:30.580 --> 3:44:33.940]  That way we can consolidate control
[3:44:33.940 --> 3:44:36.620]  and bankrupt the world economy,
[3:44:36.620 --> 3:44:41.060]  leaving companies that only I own profitable.
[3:44:41.060 --> 3:44:43.700]  You will then be my slaves.
[3:44:43.700 --> 3:44:46.980]  Oh, and then you'll get that special shot
[3:44:46.980 --> 3:44:48.940]  and you'll get it from Cobra.
[3:44:48.940 --> 3:44:51.060]  It will remove your immune system.
[3:44:51.060 --> 3:44:52.540]  So you'll be dependent on me
[3:44:52.540 --> 3:44:55.700]  for the rest of your miserable lives.
[3:44:55.700 --> 3:44:59.860]  So this could be literally your last chance
[3:44:59.860 --> 3:45:02.180]  with all the insane things happening in the world
[3:45:02.180 --> 3:45:03.460]  to get Enforced products
[3:45:03.460 --> 3:45:07.620]  and to support us into 2022, the do or die year.

[3:45:49.860 --> 3:45:51.300]  or these great supplements.
[3:45:51.300 --> 3:45:54.300]  We're gonna keep going 110%, but we need your support.
[3:45:55.500 --> 3:45:57.180]  I've been fighting as hard as I can
[3:45:57.180 --> 3:46:00.300]  for almost 28 years against the globalist.
[3:46:00.300 --> 3:46:02.340]  I wanted to stop their agenda.
[3:46:02.340 --> 3:46:04.020]  I wanted to wake up the world
[3:46:04.020 --> 3:46:06.180]  and stop them dead in their tracks
[3:46:06.180 --> 3:46:09.020]  before they went operational, but we failed.
[3:46:09.020 --> 3:46:10.660]  Yes, a lot of people are awake.
[3:46:10.660 --> 3:46:12.540]  Yes, we're not getting caught flat footed,
[3:46:12.540 --> 3:46:14.580]  but they are going ahead
[3:46:14.580 --> 3:46:17.540]  with their full operational, deindustrialization,
[3:46:17.540 --> 3:46:19.860]  great reset, and that's why it's more important
[3:46:19.860 --> 3:46:22.420]  than ever that all viewers and all listeners
[3:46:22.420 --> 3:46:24.500]  tell everybody they know about the show
[3:46:24.500 --> 3:46:26.020]  because people are ready to wake up
[3:46:26.020 --> 3:46:27.460]  and ready to hear the truth.
[3:46:27.460 --> 3:46:29.380]  So we've got an information warfare of the enemy
[3:46:29.380 --> 3:46:30.740]  and trying to stop their agenda,
[3:46:30.740 --> 3:46:32.980]  but we've also got to get personally prepared.
[3:46:32.980 --> 3:46:34.140]  And one of the number one things to do
[3:46:34.140 --> 3:46:35.580]  is high quality, storeable food.
[3:46:35.580 --> 3:46:37.140]  We've got the best food, ready to ship,
[3:46:37.140 --> 3:46:40.260]  at very affordable prices at infowarsstore.com.
[3:46:40.260 --> 3:46:42.020]  So whether it's a month or a six month
[3:46:42.020 --> 3:46:44.100]  or a year supply or specialty diets,
[3:46:44.100 --> 3:46:45.860]  it's ready to ship right now.
[3:46:45.860 --> 3:46:48.700]  Lock your orders in before food prices go up
[3:46:48.700 --> 3:46:50.780]  and before there are long lines and waits
[3:46:50.780 --> 3:46:53.140]  because believe me, serious times are coming.
[3:46:53.140 --> 3:46:55.260]  Get ready at infowarsstore.com.
[3:46:56.820 --> 3:46:59.620]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies
[3:46:59.620 --> 3:47:03.220]  of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[3:47:03.220 --> 3:47:09.780]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones show on your guest toes,
[3:47:09.780 --> 3:47:11.020]  J. Dyer of Jays Analysis.
[3:47:11.020 --> 3:47:12.820]  We were talking about the different
[3:47:12.820 --> 3:47:15.420]  MKLTRA projects and sub-projects
[3:47:15.420 --> 3:47:18.460]  and how they eventually led to things like
[3:47:18.460 --> 3:47:21.500]  MKSURGE, MKDELTA, MKNAOMI,
[3:47:21.500 --> 3:47:24.140]  which went underground and continued
[3:47:24.140 --> 3:47:26.860]  at different biological research facilities
[3:47:26.860 --> 3:47:29.700]  and basically transitioned into biometrics.
[3:47:29.700 --> 3:47:33.300]  And this is where we connect back to people like
[3:47:33.300 --> 3:47:36.580]  Dr. Jolian West and Dr. Jose Delgado
[3:47:36.580 --> 3:47:40.180]  and Dr. John C. Lilly, all of whom were experimenting
[3:47:40.180 --> 3:47:42.940]  on putting the microchips in brains and the electrodes
[3:47:42.940 --> 3:47:45.620]  and seeing if they shocked certain regions of the brain.
[3:47:45.620 --> 3:47:48.340]  What would it cause and how would people do this or that?
[3:47:48.340 --> 3:47:51.900]  And that was back in the 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s.
[3:47:51.900 --> 3:47:53.780]  They were doing that type of stuff.
[3:47:53.780 --> 3:47:56.260]  Here we are many, many years later
[3:47:56.260 --> 3:47:59.820]  it's way more advanced than that, obviously.
[3:47:59.820 --> 3:48:01.220]  So again, this is the stuff that we know about
[3:48:01.220 --> 3:48:03.180]  from the 50s and 60s primarily.
[3:48:03.180 --> 3:48:05.380]  So who knows exactly how far it is.
[3:48:05.380 --> 3:48:08.580]  We have some recent UK Ministry of Defense
[3:48:08.580 --> 3:48:11.580]  declassified transhumanist documents
[3:48:11.580 --> 3:48:14.780]  about human augmentation that speak of all of the same stuff
[3:48:14.780 --> 3:48:16.740]  and what they're going to do in the near future,
[3:48:16.740 --> 3:48:20.340]  including mandating nanotech versions of microchips, right?
[3:48:20.340 --> 3:48:22.660]  So the people who try to do that
[3:48:22.660 --> 3:48:26.580]  they all act like there's no microchip in the syringes.
[3:48:26.580 --> 3:48:28.980]  Yeah, nobody thinks there's a microchip in a syringe dummy.
[3:48:28.980 --> 3:48:31.580]  Everybody knows that it's something nanotech, right?
[3:48:31.580 --> 3:48:34.860]  It's nanotech, graphene, this kind of stuff.
[3:48:34.860 --> 3:48:36.780]  And who knows what else, right?
[3:48:37.780 --> 3:48:39.580]  Now, one of these other projects
[3:48:39.580 --> 3:48:41.220]  that I want to get back to that's relevant
[3:48:41.220 --> 3:48:47.060]  is the idea of the idea of the idea of
[3:48:47.060 --> 3:48:51.060]  the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea
[3:48:51.060 --> 3:48:55.940]  of they did in, let's see which project this was,
[3:48:55.940 --> 3:48:57.260]  operation resurrection.
[3:48:57.260 --> 3:48:59.580]  Now, this one is wild
[3:48:59.580 --> 3:49:02.300]  because this actually sounds like the Kingsman.
[3:49:02.300 --> 3:49:04.180]  If you've seen the Kingsman and you know
[3:49:04.180 --> 3:49:06.540]  in the first installment of that movie,
[3:49:06.540 --> 3:49:11.540]  the Samuel L. Jackson plays the cell phone tech,
[3:49:11.540 --> 3:49:13.460]  you know, billionaire, zillionaire guy
[3:49:13.460 --> 3:49:17.100]  who basically uses the chips in the cell phones
[3:49:17.100 --> 3:49:20.260]  to set off this signal which drives everybody nuts.
[3:49:20.260 --> 3:49:22.740]  And turns out in Iquitos Peru,
[3:49:22.740 --> 3:49:24.660]  there was a similar project
[3:49:24.660 --> 3:49:27.620]  where they experimented with monkeys,
[3:49:27.620 --> 3:49:30.260]  blasting them with all these RF frequencies and signals
[3:49:30.260 --> 3:49:32.540]  to find which ones actually drove them nuts.
[3:49:32.540 --> 3:49:34.940]  And again, remember in Brzezinski's book,
[3:49:34.940 --> 3:49:38.220]  Between Two Ages, he talks about ELF and VLF technology
[3:49:38.220 --> 3:49:39.940]  being able, even in the 70s,
[3:49:39.940 --> 3:49:42.700]  to send out these waves and signals
[3:49:42.700 --> 3:49:45.420]  that could either agitate and get people kind of,
[3:49:45.420 --> 3:49:46.820]  you know, ready to fight each other
[3:49:46.820 --> 3:49:49.580]  or calm them down and make them docile.
[3:49:49.580 --> 3:49:51.340]  So this is real.
[3:49:51.340 --> 3:49:53.500]  I mean, I don't know how advanced they are
[3:49:53.500 --> 3:49:54.820]  in terms of doing this nowadays.
[3:49:54.820 --> 3:49:57.140]  I assume it's more advanced than we think,
[3:49:57.140 --> 3:49:59.420]  but whether this is real is not really in question.
[3:49:59.420 --> 3:50:01.580]  It's in all of these guys' documents.
[3:50:01.580 --> 3:50:04.340]  And again, you can see the pattern and the commonality
[3:50:04.340 --> 3:50:07.700]  between what's in these research projects of MKUltra
[3:50:07.700 --> 3:50:10.220]  and what the big global elite strategists and planners
[3:50:10.220 --> 3:50:12.540]  like Brzezinski, like Jacques Attali,
[3:50:12.540 --> 3:50:14.300]  they're all talking about in their books.
[3:50:14.300 --> 3:50:16.420]  And again, these are not hidden books.
[3:50:16.420 --> 3:50:18.260]  They're not conspiracy books.
[3:50:18.260 --> 3:50:22.420]  These are people at the top of the geopolitical chess board
[3:50:22.420 --> 3:50:24.660]  who make decisions for the presidents
[3:50:24.660 --> 3:50:27.020]  working on the best of the global elite,
[3:50:27.020 --> 3:50:29.260]  CFR, Trilateral Commission.
[3:50:29.260 --> 3:50:30.700]  They just talk about all this openly
[3:50:30.700 --> 3:50:32.620]  and they count on everybody being too stupid
[3:50:32.620 --> 3:50:34.460]  to even figure it out.
[3:50:34.460 --> 3:50:36.420]  They know that nobody's gonna go read these books.
[3:50:36.420 --> 3:50:37.540]  So I'm here doing the homework
[3:50:37.540 --> 3:50:39.340]  for you reading these boring books.
[3:50:40.660 --> 3:50:42.020]  Operation Spellbinder.
[3:50:42.020 --> 3:50:43.380]  This is the one I mentioned earlier,
[3:50:43.380 --> 3:50:48.380]  which was the replacement for Operation Mindbender.
[3:50:48.740 --> 3:50:51.100]  So Mindbender apparently didn't work that well
[3:50:51.100 --> 3:50:53.180]  when they were experimenting on creating a session.
[3:50:53.180 --> 3:50:55.100]  So they revamped it.
[3:50:56.100 --> 3:50:58.300]  Under Richard Helms in 1966,
[3:50:58.300 --> 3:51:00.940]  it became Operation Spellbinder.
[3:51:00.940 --> 3:51:04.540]  And this one was interesting because it admits
[3:51:04.540 --> 3:51:09.260]  working on using Viet Cong POWs.
[3:51:09.260 --> 3:51:11.300]  So they renamed this Operation Spellbinder
[3:51:11.300 --> 3:51:13.620]  and this is what most people think is
[3:51:13.620 --> 3:51:15.940]  the Manchurian candidate type of program.
[3:51:17.020 --> 3:51:18.420]  A hypnotist was recruited from
[3:51:18.420 --> 3:51:21.060]  the American Society of Clinical Experimental Hypnosis.
[3:51:21.060 --> 3:51:23.740]  He became known amongst the agency staff as Dr. Fingers.
[3:51:23.740 --> 3:51:25.340]  He was selected because he stated that he,
[3:51:25.340 --> 3:51:26.660]  this is like comic book,
[3:51:26.660 --> 3:51:28.820]  he'll stop Dr. Fingers to operate.
[3:51:28.820 --> 3:51:32.220]  Is it Dr. Mindbender or isn't he a comic book guy too?
[3:51:33.180 --> 3:51:35.500]  Listen, the intended victims of these experiments
[3:51:35.500 --> 3:51:38.140]  were to be programmed assassins.
[3:51:38.140 --> 3:51:40.100]  They thought, oh, maybe we can get Castro
[3:51:40.100 --> 3:51:42.300]  with one of these people, we can send them into Cuba
[3:51:42.300 --> 3:51:43.780]  and get rid of Castro with one.
[3:51:43.780 --> 3:51:47.300]  Of course, I didn't obviously never worked or manifested.
[3:51:47.300 --> 3:51:48.780]  That was at least was the plan.
[3:51:50.980 --> 3:51:52.780]  Ultimately it says in this essay,
[3:51:52.780 --> 3:51:55.420]  the program was trying to just get deeper and deeper
[3:51:55.420 --> 3:51:58.740]  into mastering the brain and the inner workings of the mind,
[3:51:58.740 --> 3:52:00.900]  how it worked and how to control it.
[3:52:00.900 --> 3:52:03.220]  Now remember one of these guys,
[3:52:03.220 --> 3:52:05.860]  and this book is completely unreadable.
[3:52:05.860 --> 3:52:09.500]  I actually read it, I don't know how, but it is unreadable.
[3:52:09.500 --> 3:52:12.620]  But one of the MK Ultra doctors, Dr. John C. Lilly,
[3:52:12.620 --> 3:52:15.500]  if you wanna understand how they view man and the brain,
[3:52:15.500 --> 3:52:17.460]  he wrote programming and meta-programming
[3:52:17.460 --> 3:52:19.740]  in the human biocomputer.
[3:52:19.740 --> 3:52:20.940]  And he admits in this book
[3:52:20.940 --> 3:52:22.500]  that they experimented on children.
[3:52:22.500 --> 3:52:25.620]  They gave children high doses of LSD, wiped their brains,
[3:52:25.620 --> 3:52:28.940]  and he would put mirrors and clocks and crazy artwork
[3:52:28.940 --> 3:52:31.460]  in front of the kids trying to reprogram them.
[3:52:31.460 --> 3:52:33.220]  So if you don't think they would do this,
[3:52:33.220 --> 3:52:35.380]  realize that they admit they do this
[3:52:35.380 --> 3:52:36.900]  and they do it to kids.
[3:52:36.900 --> 3:52:40.220]  You don't think they would do bad things to kids now?
[3:52:40.220 --> 3:52:42.340]  They're doing it, and they've done it for a long time
[3:52:42.340 --> 3:52:43.460]  and they openly talk about it.
[3:52:43.460 --> 3:52:45.620]  It's in their books, they don't care.
[3:52:45.620 --> 3:52:47.820]  That's how brazen psychopathy is,
[3:52:47.820 --> 3:52:50.260]  especially at the level of the power structure.
[3:52:51.500 --> 3:52:54.740]  They get, it's almost a compulsion, right?
[3:52:54.740 --> 3:52:58.460]  Where they have to tell you, they're compelled to tell you.
[3:52:58.460 --> 3:53:00.980]  And it's also a strategy to tell people too,
[3:53:00.980 --> 3:53:04.140]  because it's gaslighting, it's a way to throw it
[3:53:04.140 --> 3:53:05.940]  in people's faces and then they don't know what to do.
[3:53:05.940 --> 3:53:08.220]  They're in a catatonic state that they can't believe
[3:53:08.220 --> 3:53:09.220]  that they're doing this.
[3:53:10.460 --> 3:53:14.580]  Subproject 142 and Subproject 94,
[3:53:14.580 --> 3:53:18.500]  these relate directly to the transhumanist element
[3:53:18.500 --> 3:53:19.340]  that I'm talking about,
[3:53:19.340 --> 3:53:21.580]  because a small biological program
[3:53:21.580 --> 3:53:25.740]  of electrical brain stimulation was inserted here
[3:53:25.740 --> 3:53:27.820]  as a new element of these projects.
[3:53:27.820 --> 3:53:30.340]  This would be with the intent to engage
[3:53:30.340 --> 3:53:33.220]  in very practical experiments at some point in the work
[3:53:33.220 --> 3:53:36.260]  that could relate to espionage and security problems.
[3:53:36.260 --> 3:53:38.660]  And could you eavesdrop on your spies?
[3:53:38.660 --> 3:53:40.100]  Could you have a brain chip
[3:53:40.100 --> 3:53:42.740]  by which people don't even know that they're chipped?
[3:53:42.740 --> 3:53:44.660]  And maybe they go to some place
[3:53:44.660 --> 3:53:48.740]  and they become kind of a walking surveillance device
[3:53:48.740 --> 3:53:51.020]  where they've got a chip in them they don't even know.
[3:53:51.020 --> 3:53:53.100]  And you're listening from your base
[3:53:53.100 --> 3:53:57.900]  as to what people are saying in terms of wherever they are.
[3:53:57.900 --> 3:54:01.020]  This was another one, we don't know how far this went,
[3:54:01.020 --> 3:54:04.180]  but Subproject 94 was actually tasked
[3:54:04.180 --> 3:54:07.020]  with miniaturizing, stimulating electrodes
[3:54:07.020 --> 3:54:09.380]  and implanting them in different brain centers
[3:54:09.380 --> 3:54:10.220]  and brain areas.
[3:54:11.860 --> 3:54:14.580]  This involved animals, dogs, cats and monkeys.
[3:54:15.500 --> 3:54:16.580]  It doesn't say humans,
[3:54:16.580 --> 3:54:18.740]  but I feel like they probably did.
[3:54:18.740 --> 3:54:20.300]  I mean, they're already, right?
[3:54:20.300 --> 3:54:23.700]  I mean, they were putting microchips into the troops
[3:54:23.700 --> 3:54:26.060]  went back in Desert Storm, right?
[3:54:26.060 --> 3:54:28.420]  Didn't that come out that they were already
[3:54:28.420 --> 3:54:30.860]  giving the troops microchips back at that time?
[3:54:30.860 --> 3:54:33.380]  And I think it's more common now.
[3:54:33.380 --> 3:54:37.020]  Alex just showed a Newsweek article earlier
[3:54:37.020 --> 3:54:41.020]  where they were talking about the VAX pass
[3:54:41.020 --> 3:54:43.820]  or a form of microchip or nanotech,
[3:54:43.820 --> 3:54:45.540]  which would show your history
[3:54:45.540 --> 3:54:47.220]  and your record of vaccination.
[3:54:47.220 --> 3:54:48.300]  And that was always the plan.
[3:54:48.300 --> 3:54:51.060]  That was the plan 30, 40 years ago, right?
[3:54:51.060 --> 3:54:53.900]  Brzezinski level plans, long, long time ago
[3:54:53.900 --> 3:54:55.660]  before Klaus was making these plans.
[3:54:58.180 --> 3:55:00.100]  And again, this makes us think as well,
[3:55:00.100 --> 3:55:02.860]  as I said, of the Phoenix program, Vietnam.
[3:55:02.860 --> 3:55:06.380]  This is where they were basically weaponizing
[3:55:06.380 --> 3:55:09.940]  crazed killers to turn them into assassins and serial killers.
[3:55:09.940 --> 3:55:10.780]  And believe it or not,
[3:55:10.780 --> 3:55:12.380]  they actually researched serial killers.
[3:55:12.380 --> 3:55:13.460]  That's a whole other project
[3:55:13.460 --> 3:55:18.460]  that I didn't get to the idea of the personality tests.
[3:55:18.460 --> 3:55:20.700]  Did you know personality test by Dr. John Gittinger
[3:55:20.700 --> 3:55:22.420]  that it comes out of NKULTRA?
[3:55:22.420 --> 3:55:24.980]  Dr. John Gittinger, the emitter of the personality test
[3:55:24.980 --> 3:55:25.820]  and all of that.
[3:55:25.820 --> 3:55:28.060]  That was all to try to categorize people
[3:55:28.060 --> 3:55:30.620]  to make it easier for the CIA to assess
[3:55:31.900 --> 3:55:35.700]  the heads of state, geopolitical actors and so forth
[3:55:35.700 --> 3:55:38.500]  and see how they were most easy to manipulate.
[3:55:39.540 --> 3:55:40.740]  And to Blackmail.
[3:55:40.740 --> 3:55:44.260]  And this is where they got into studies of perverts,
[3:55:44.260 --> 3:55:48.900]  deviants, psychopaths, psychotics, and yes, serial killers.
[3:55:48.900 --> 3:55:52.180]  So there's multiple projects involving the weaponization
[3:55:52.180 --> 3:55:54.260]  and study of human beings that were deviants
[3:55:54.260 --> 3:55:57.580]  and serial killers, at least three that I've come across now.
[3:55:57.580 --> 3:55:59.700]  But I wanted to cap it off with what was back
[3:55:59.700 --> 3:56:02.740]  in Ray Kurzweil's book many years ago, The Singularity,
[3:56:02.740 --> 3:56:04.300]  which if you've seen Endgame,
[3:56:04.300 --> 3:56:07.220]  then you've seen Alex talking about this for a long time.
[3:56:07.220 --> 3:56:09.500]  But this is Kurzweil's second book.
[3:56:09.500 --> 3:56:11.540]  His first book was The Age of Spiritual Machines
[3:56:11.540 --> 3:56:13.800]  that came out, I think, in a 2000, 2001 period.
[3:56:13.800 --> 3:56:16.260]  And then he wrote this one in 2005,
[3:56:16.260 --> 3:56:18.740]  kind of updating his predictions.
[3:56:19.780 --> 3:56:22.980]  And in the section pages two,
[3:56:22.980 --> 3:56:26.780]  or excuse me, 3, 14, 15, 16, where he gets into VR,
[3:56:26.780 --> 3:56:28.740]  what I found fascinating was that he was talking
[3:56:28.740 --> 3:56:30.500]  about the metaverse, he doesn't use that word,
[3:56:30.500 --> 3:56:33.860]  but he says that, yes, we're gonna roll out all of this,
[3:56:33.860 --> 3:56:35.100]  there's gonna be the metaverse,
[3:56:35.100 --> 3:56:36.700]  there's gonna be all this stuff.
[3:56:36.700 --> 3:56:38.980]  And he says, but what's really gonna take people
[3:56:38.980 --> 3:56:42.540]  by surprise is that when we roll this out,
[3:56:42.540 --> 3:56:44.980]  it's not gonna be that there's gonna be a microchip,
[3:56:44.980 --> 3:56:46.100]  or it's not eventually gonna be
[3:56:46.100 --> 3:56:48.780]  that you have to wear a big headset.
[3:56:48.780 --> 3:56:51.300]  He says his goal is that they wanna get it
[3:56:51.300 --> 3:56:55.220]  to where there's a brain chip that steps in between
[3:56:55.220 --> 3:56:59.220]  your brain and your perception, your five cents perception.
[3:56:59.220 --> 3:57:00.660]  And he says, what we'll be able to do
[3:57:00.660 --> 3:57:03.500]  through the brain chip version of the matrix
[3:57:03.500 --> 3:57:05.180]  is that we'll just immediately give you
[3:57:05.180 --> 3:57:07.620]  your sense data and your sense impressions.
[3:57:07.620 --> 3:57:11.060]  He says that we will be in charge of what you perceive
[3:57:11.060 --> 3:57:12.300]  and what you feel.
[3:57:12.300 --> 3:57:14.100]  So it's not just controlling perception
[3:57:14.100 --> 3:57:15.300]  in the sense of mass media,
[3:57:15.300 --> 3:57:19.260]  it's according to Kurzweil, literally controlling the mind
[3:57:19.260 --> 3:57:22.260]  through the nanotech, through the metaverse.
[3:57:22.260 --> 3:57:25.900]  Stepping in between you and the external world,
[3:57:25.900 --> 3:57:28.540]  not through a headset, but through eventually having
[3:57:28.540 --> 3:57:31.780]  the nanotech in your mind, where the signals
[3:57:31.780 --> 3:57:34.580]  tell you what things come into your brain,
[3:57:34.580 --> 3:57:38.420]  literally controlling the input that comes into your brain.
[3:57:39.500 --> 3:57:40.940]  Total mind control.
[3:57:40.940 --> 3:57:44.220]  He admits that that is the possibility and the goal.
[3:57:44.220 --> 3:57:47.660]  So this could be, I never compromise the quality
[3:57:47.660 --> 3:57:50.020]  of ingredients we put in InfoWars Live products.
[3:57:50.020 --> 3:57:51.580]  And that's why for more than two years,
[3:57:51.580 --> 3:57:53.540]  we've been sold out of Ultimate Bone Broth.
[3:57:53.540 --> 3:57:57.140]  And we could never get the ingredients again until now
[3:57:57.140 --> 3:57:59.380]  and we have reformulated and not just used
[3:57:59.380 --> 3:58:01.420]  the same ingredients, we've boosted it
[3:58:01.420 --> 3:58:03.220]  and made them even stronger.
[3:58:03.220 --> 3:58:05.060]  So out of all the bone broths out there,
[3:58:05.060 --> 3:58:07.060]  I'm telling you, this is next level.
[3:58:07.060 --> 3:58:08.260]  Listen to what it's got in it.
[3:58:08.260 --> 3:58:11.340]  Cutting edge chicken bone broth protein isolate powder
[3:58:11.340 --> 3:58:13.420]  for better flavor and dissolvability.
[3:58:13.420 --> 3:58:16.300]  It's got turmeric root, chaga mushroom, bee pollen,
[3:58:16.300 --> 3:58:18.340]  goji berry, alfalfa herb powder,
[3:58:18.340 --> 3:58:21.020]  and a bunch of other amazing known berries,
[3:58:21.020 --> 3:58:22.940]  that turbo charge your body with antioxidants.
[3:58:22.940 --> 3:58:24.540]  And then it's got a bunch of other incredible things
[3:58:24.540 --> 3:58:27.100]  like magnesium, potassium, and sodium added.
[3:58:27.100 --> 3:58:29.540]  I mean, this sucker has got everything for your electrolytes.
[3:58:29.540 --> 3:58:32.100]  It's got real organic cocoa butter powder
[3:58:32.100 --> 3:58:34.980]  with natural chocolate flavor and a touch of sea salt.
[3:58:34.980 --> 3:58:36.300]  And it just goes on and on.
[3:58:36.300 --> 3:58:37.500]  It is now back in stock.
[3:58:37.500 --> 3:58:40.900]  Ultimate Bone Broth Plus, available at 20% off
[3:58:40.900 --> 3:58:44.940]  and free shipping out of the gates at infowarstore.com.
[3:58:45.980 --> 3:58:47.980]  If you think that tyranny and oppression
[3:58:47.980 --> 3:58:50.260]  we're living under now is bad,
[3:58:50.260 --> 3:58:52.180]  wait till they've got their world ID,
[3:58:52.180 --> 3:58:56.300]  and that's exactly what the COVID passports are all about.
[3:58:56.300 --> 3:58:59.060]  And CloudSwab and the UN and all the other
[3:58:59.060 --> 3:59:01.700]  globalist leaders own words they admit
[3:59:01.700 --> 3:59:04.940]  that once they've gotten you with that system then,
[3:59:04.940 --> 3:59:07.700]  they're gonna carbon tax you everywhere you go
[3:59:07.700 --> 3:59:09.180]  and track what you do.
[3:59:09.180 --> 3:59:11.660]  And publicly they're saying they're gonna decide
[3:59:11.660 --> 3:59:14.180]  when you can travel and when you can't travel.
[3:59:14.180 --> 3:59:17.140]  And MasterCard and all the other big companies
[3:59:17.140 --> 3:59:19.900]  are currently announcing they're gonna track what you do
[3:59:19.900 --> 3:59:23.460]  and where you go and tax you with a carbon tax for it.
[3:59:23.460 --> 3:59:27.060]  This is the holy grail of tyranny, ladies and gentlemen.
[3:59:27.060 --> 3:59:28.780]  This is the takeover in humanity.
[3:59:28.780 --> 3:59:30.420]  Better wake up and say no.
[3:59:30.420 --> 3:59:32.140]  Finally, folks are starting to wake up.
[3:59:32.140 --> 3:59:33.660]  Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson and others
[3:59:33.660 --> 3:59:35.660]  are leading the charge along with info wars.
[3:59:35.660 --> 3:59:36.500]  But it's not enough.
[3:59:36.500 --> 3:59:39.140]  Every individual has to not comply
[3:59:39.140 --> 3:59:39.980]  and we have to talk about
[3:59:39.980 --> 3:59:41.580]  bringing the globalists to justice.
[3:59:41.580 --> 3:59:43.420]  You see, they need the fear of God
[3:59:43.420 --> 3:59:45.140]  put in them legally and lawfully.
[3:59:45.140 --> 3:59:47.380]  If you are receiving this transmission,
[3:59:47.380 --> 4:00:16.380]  you are the resistance.
